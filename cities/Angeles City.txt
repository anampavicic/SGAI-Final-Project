'''Angeles''' ({{IPA|tl|ˈaŋhɛlɛs|local}}), officially the '''City of Angeles''' ({{lang-pam|Lakanbalen ning Angeles}}; {{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Angeles}}), is a 1st class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|highly urbanized city]] in the [[Central Luzon]] region of the [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 462,928 people.{{PH census|current}}

While Angeles City is politically independent from the province of [[Pampanga]], it is usually grouped with it for statistical purposes by the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]] and also it is the largest city of that province.

Angeles City is the urban core of [[Metro Clark]],<ref name="PDP 2015">{{cite web |title=Philippine Development Plan 2015-2022 |url=https://pdp.neda.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7212021_Updated-PDP-2017-2022.pdf |website=National Economic Development Authority |access-date=21 November 2023}}</ref> an urban area in Pampanga.

==History==
{{more citations needed section|date=November 2015}}

===Spanish colonial era===
[[File:Don Angel Pantaleon De Miranda House (Santo Rosario Street, Angeles, Pampanga; 05-27-2023).jpg|thumb|Pantaleon de Miranda House along Santo Rosario St.]]
In 1796, the ''[[gobernadorcillo]]'' or town head of [[San Fernando, Pampanga|San Fernando]], ''[[Don (honorific)|Don]]'' Ángel Pantaleón de Miranda, and his wife, ''[[Don (honorific)|Doña]]'' Rosalía de Jesús, along with some followers, staked out a new settlement, which they named ''Culiát'' because of the abundance of vines (''Gnetum indicum'')<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pavia |first1=Joey |title=Angeles's 'culiat' vines: Then vanishing, now nurtured {{!}} Joey Pavia |url=https://businessmirror.com.ph/2014/10/11/angeless-culiat-vines-then-vanishing-now-nurtured/ |access-date=July 23, 2021 |work=BusinessMirror |date=October 11, 2014}}</ref> of that name in the area. The new settlers cleared the woodland and cultivated the area for rice and sugar farming. Don Ángel built his first house with light materials at the northwest corner of the intersection of Sapang Balen and the road going towards the town of [[Porac, Pampanga|Porac]]. It was later donated to the [[Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines|Catholic Church]] and became a cemetery called "Campo Santong Matua" (today the site of Nepomuceno Coliseum).<ref>[http://philippinestravelguide.net/visit/angeles/ Angeles City | Philippines Travel Guide<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724005348/http://philippinestravelguide.net/visit/angeles/ |date=July 24, 2011 }}</ref>

On May 12, 1812, the new settlers tried to make Culiat a self-governing town but the friars resisted the move, led by Fray José Pometa. Ten years later, on February 11, 1822, Don Ángel filed a petition for the township of Culiat to secede from San Fernando, but it was denied. This was followed by another petition within the same year, jointly signed by Don Ángel, his son-in-law, Mariano Henson, and the latter's father, Severino Henson. He donated 35 hectares for the construction of the first Catholic church, a convent and a primary school while Doña Agustina Henson de Nepomuceno, the niece of who would become the first ''{{lang|es|gobernadorcillo}}'' of Angeles in 1830, Don Ciriaco de Miranda, gave land for the new public market. Don Ángel paid the complete amount required by law just for the secession of Culiat from San Fernando. There were only 160 taxpayers then but the law required that it should have at least 500 taxpayers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelesboard.com/angeles-city-general-tourist-info.php|title=General Tourist info Angeles City – Philippines|access-date=June 27, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717020450/http://www.angelesboard.com/angeles-city-general-tourist-info.php|archive-date=July 17, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Located some {{convert|10|mi|km}} north of Pampanga's capital, Culiat became a barrio of San Fernando for 33 years and on December 8, 1829, became a separate municipality. The newly-autonomous town was renamed "{{lang|es|El Pueblo de los Ángeles}}" in honor of its patron saints, the Holy Angels, and the name of its founder, Don Ángel, coinciding with the rise of new ''[[barangay|barrio]]s'' such as Santo Cristo (as the ''[[poblacion|población]]'' or town proper), Cutcut, Pampang and Pulong Anunas. The progressive barrios developed some new industries like a sugar mill and a wine distillery. The transition of Angeles from a jungle clearing to a barrio, to a town and finally to a city took 168 years and in all that time, it survived locusts' infestations, wars, epidemics, volcanic eruptions and typhoons to become one of the fast rising towns in the country.  When it received its first official municipal charter, the town contained some 661 people, 151 houses and an area of 38.65&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name="TouristCenter">{{cite web

On May 7, 1899, General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] transferred the seat of the [[First Philippine Republic]] to Angeles. It then became the site of celebrations for the first anniversary of Philippine independence, which was proclaimed a year earlier in [[Kawit]], [[Cavite]]. Events included a parade, led by the youngest ever Filipino generals, [[Gregorio del Pilar]] and [[Manuel Tinio]], with General Aguinaldo viewing the proceedings from the Pamintuan Residence, which was the Presidential Palace from May to July 1899 (and later was the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas|Central Bank of the Philippines]] office in Central Luzon, before its ownership passed to the [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]]). Aguinaldo's sojourn was short, however, for in July of this same year he transferred his government to the province of [[Tarlac]] following Angeles' occupation by the American forces.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=341377|title=Punch-drunk to fitness|work=The Philippine Star|access-date=June 27, 2015}}</ref>

===American invasion era===
On August 10, 1899, U.S. forces began the attack on Angeles confident in capturing it in a few days. However, the Filipino Army defending the town refused to give in so easily and fiercely fought back and for three months, they battled the Americans in and around the town. It was only after the battle on November 5, 1899, that the town finally fell into American hands. The Battle of Angeles was considered to be the longest in the history of the [[Filipino-American War]] in Pampanga. This led to the establishment of an American camp in Barrio Talimundoc (in what is now Lourdes Sur), located next to the railroad station, in order to establish control over the central plains of Luzon. In January 1900, General [[Frederick D. Grant]] organized the first U.S. Civil Government in Angeles by appointing an ''alcalde'' or municipal mayor, beginning American rule over Angeles.<ref>[http://my.angelescityportal.com/m/articles/view/Angeles-City-History-Pt-2-American-Period Angeles City History Pt. 2 (American Period) | Angeles City Bars | Angeles City Hotels | Forums | Photos | Videos<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707143500/http://my.angelescityportal.com/m/articles/view/Angeles-City-History-Pt-2-American-Period |date=July 7, 2011 }}</ref>

In 1902, the [[United States Army]] studied relocating their post from Barrio Talimundoc to a fertile plain in Barrio [[Sapang Bato]], which supposedly had better grass for their horses. A year after that, U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] signed an executive order on September 1, establishing {{convert|7700|acre|km2}} of land in Sapang Bato as [[Fort Stotsenburg]] (which later would expand to {{convert|156204|acre|km2}} in 1908 to become [[Clark Air Base]]). It was centered on what would in later years become Clark Air Base's parade ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clarkab.org/history/index.htm |title=Clark Air Base History |publisher=Clarkab.org |access-date=July 14, 2009}}</ref>

The Americans quickly commandeered Holy Rosary Parish Church and converted it into an army hospital, with the choir loft served as a dental clinic. The ''[[clergy house|convento]]'', which now houses Holy Family Academy, was the barracks for medical officers and enlisted men. The [[sacristy]] was the only portion where Angeleños could hear [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. When the Americans finally vacated the church in 1904 and relocated to Fort Stotsenburg, [[parish priest]] Rev. Vicente Lapus listed a total of [[United States dollar|US$]]638 for portions of the church destroyed, looted church items and treasures, and arrears on rentals.

===World War II===
Hours after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Japan attacked the Philippines, targeting the American military presence, as well as the Philippine Army, and taking over the civilian government. During the Japanese occupation in the country, 57,000 Filipino and American [[prisoners of war]] passed the town of Angeles. They were forced to join the [[Bataan Death March]], going to [[Camp O'Donnell]] in [[Capas, Tarlac]]. Angeleños showed their sympathy by handing them food, milk, boiled eggs, rice cakes, cigarettes, and water. Angeleños followed them up to the train station in Dau railway station in [[Mabalacat]] to give moral and spiritual support, and even helped the escapees.

War historians considered the bombing of Fort Stotsenburg on December 8, 1941, at 12:30&nbsp;p.m. as one of the most destructive air raids in [[World War II]], because almost all the American war planes were wrecked on the ground. In thirty minutes, the air might<!-- OK here: don't correct it--> of the United States in the Far East was completely destroyed.

On the early morning of New Year's Day 1942, the first Japanese troops entered Angeles; they would occupy it until January 1945. During the Japanese invasion, another type of local government was set up on January 22, 1942. During the Japanese occupation, Clark Air Base then became a major center for staging Japanese air operations. Japanese aircraft flying out of Clark participated in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], considered to be the largest naval battle of the Second World War and possibly the largest naval battle in history.<ref name="Morison1956">{{cite book | chapter = Leyte, June&nbsp;1944 – January 1945 |title=[[History of United States Naval Operations in World War II]] |volume=XII |last=Morison | first =Samuel E. |year=1956 |publisher=Little & Brown |location=Boston }}</ref><ref name="Woodward1947">{{cite book |title=The Battle for Leyte Gulf |last=Woodward |first=C. Vann |year=1947 |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York }}</ref>

Clark Air Base was recaptured by the Americans in January 1945, after three months of fierce fighting in the Philippines. After three years of atrocities committed by Japanese forces, the town and the rest of the Philippines were finally liberated by the combined United States and Philippine Commonwealth troops in 1945. The building of the general headquarters of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] and [[Philippine Constabulary]] was situated in Angeles from January 1945 to June 1946, during and after World War II.

===Philippine independence===
====Cityhood====
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
After World War II, the Philippines gained independence from the United States on July 4, 1946, but then would be tied to a neo-colonial relationship. The "Treaty of General Relations" signed on independence day itself signified the Americans' withdrawal and surrender of possession, control and sovereignty over the Philippines, except the use of their bases. It was followed by the Philippine-American Military Bases Agreement on March 14, 1947, allowing the U.S. to maintain territorial integrity and sovereignty over Clark Air Base and [[Subic Bay|Subic Naval Base]] for the next 44 years. Clark occupied 63,103 hectares and served as the tactical operational U.S. air force installation in the entire Southeast Asian region that had the capacity to accommodate the U.S. military transport planes, which served the entire Western Pacific.

Through the years, although Fort Stotsenburg continued to expand to become what would eventually be known as Clark Air Base, Angeles, despite its proximity to the American camp, did not progress fast and remained fairly small until the end of World War II. It was finally inaugurated on January 1, 1964, as a chartered city under Republic Act No. 3700 and then proceeded to enter a period of tremendous growth that resulted in its present position as the "Premier City in Central Luzon." It was through Mayor Rafael del Rosario's brainchild that Angeles became a city. He gained the distinction of being the last municipal mayor of Angeles. He was assisted in the preparation of the City Chapter by Attorney Enrique Tayag, a prominent resident of the town. Congresswoman Juanita L. Nepomuceno of the first district of Pampanga sponsored the bill in Congress, which was approved by then President [[Diosdado Macapagal]], the ninth Philippine president and a native of the province of Pampanga.<ref name="ClarktonHotel">{{cite web

====Mount Pinatubo eruption and Angeles today====
[[File:Collapsed hangars at Clark Air Base.jpg|thumbnail|Collapsed hangars at the [[Clark Air Base]] after the 1991 eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]]]]
On June 15, 1991, Angeles was affected by [[1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo|the cataclysmic eruption]] of nearby [[Mount Pinatubo]], with up to 60,000 people being [[Mount Pinatubo#Evacuations|evacuated]] from the city.  It was the second-largest volcanic eruption of the twentieth century and, by far, the largest eruption to affect a densely populated area.  The province of [[Pampanga]], Clark specifically, was badly hit and the agricultural lands, as well as other businesses, were covered by tons of [[lahar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/1997/fs113-97/ |title=The Cataclysmic 1991 Eruption of Mount Pinatubo, Philippines, Fact Sheet 113-97 |publisher=Pubs.usgs.gov |access-date=July 14, 2009}}</ref> There were no casualties reported inside Clark two days from the initial eruption because the 18,000 personnel and their families were transported to [[Guam]] and the [[Subic Naval Base]] in [[Zambales]].

The eruption of Mount Pinatubo forced the leadership of the U.S. to prematurely abandon its military installation at Clark Air Base. This was in addition to a vote by the Philippine Senate in 1991 to no longer extend the [[Laurel–Langley Agreement]], which allowed the presence of U.S. military forces on Philippine territory, thus ending the long chapter of Filipino-American relations in the history of Angeles. The U.S. military never returned to Clark, turning over the damaged base to the Philippine government on November 26, 1991<ref>{{cite web

Being home of the former [[Clark Air Base]] (once the largest United States military facility outside the continental United States), it was significantly affected by the fallout from the eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in 1991. The economy of Angeles was heavily dependent on the American base at that time.<ref name="TouristCenter" />

In 1993, a full cleanup and removal of volcanic ash deposits began and the former U.S. base was transformed into the [[Clark Special Economic Zone]] (CSEZ).<ref name="SunStarMillionth" /> The creation of CSEZ has helped to offset the loss of income and jobs previously generated by the presence of the U.S. base in the city. Today, Angeles and Clark form the hub for business, industry, aviation, and tourism in the Philippines as well as a leisure, fitness, entertainment and gaming center of [[Central Luzon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingnews.ph/195838/abaya-keen-clark-main-philippine-airport |title=Breaking News: Abaya keen on Clark as main Philippine airport &#124; Business News Philippines |publisher=Breakingnews.ph |date=September 8, 2012 |access-date=October 8, 2012}}</ref>
