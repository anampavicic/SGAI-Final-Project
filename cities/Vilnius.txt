According to a [[legend]] [[Writing|recorded]] during the {{Circa|1530s}}, Grand Duke [[Gediminas]] ({{circa|1275}}–1341) was hunting in the sacred forest near [[Šventaragis' Valley]], (where the Vilnia flows into the river [[Neris]]. The successful [[European bison|wisent]] hunt lasted longer than expected, and Gediminas decided to spend the night in the valley. He fell asleep and dreamed of a huge [[Iron Wolf (character)|Iron Wolf]] at the top of a hill, howling loudly. Upon awakening, the Duke asked the ''[[Kriwe|krivis]]'' [[Lizdeika]] to interpret the dream. The chief priest told him:<blockquote>What is destined for the ruler and the State of Lithuania, is thus: the Iron Wolf [[Vilnius Castle Complex|represents a castle]] and a city which will be established by you on this site. This city will be the capital of the Lithuanian lands and the dwelling of [[List of heads of state of Lithuania|their rulers]], and the glory of their deeds shall echo throughout the world.</blockquote>
Gediminas, obeying [[List of Lithuanian gods and mythological figures|the gods]], built two castles: the Lower Castle in the valley, and the Crooked Castle on [[Three Crosses|Bald Hill]]. He moved his court there, declared it his permanent seat and capital, and developed the surrounding area into a city he named Vilnius.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ironwolf.lt/the-legend-of-the-founding-of-vilnius/ |title=The Legend of the Founding of Vilnius - Gediminas Dream |website=Ironwolf.lt |access-date=28 February 2022}}</ref>{{Better source needed|reason=The current source is insufficiently reliable ([[WP:NOTRS]]).|date=October 2023}}<ref name="leg">{{cite news | last=Gudmantas | first=Kęstutis | title=LDK istorija: Metraščių pasakojimas apie Vilniaus įkūrimą – mitas ir istorija | work=15min | date=9 December 2013 | url=https://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/istorija/ldk-istorija-metrasciu-pasakojimas-apie-vilniaus-ikurima-mitas-ir-istorija-582-391039 | language=lt | access-date=28 March 2024}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Vilnius}}
{{For timeline}}
[[File:Transcript of Gediminas' letter, which is the oldest known mentioning of Vilnius in written sources (25 January 1323).jpg|thumb|left|alt=A 14th-century manuscript|The oldest known mention of Vilnius, in Gediminas' 1323 [[Letters of Gediminas|letter]]]]
Vilnius' history dates to the [[Stone Age]]. The city has been ruled by [[Russian Empire|imperial]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet Russia]], [[Napoleonic France]], [[German Empire|imperial]] and [[Nazi Germany]], [[interwar Poland]], and Lithuania.

Initially a Baltic settlement, Vilnius became significant in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. The city was first mentioned in letters by Grand Duke Gediminas, who invited Jews and Germans to settle and built a wooden castle on a hill. Vilnius became a city in 1387, after the Christianization of Lithuania, and was settled by craftsmen and merchants of a variety of nationalities. It was the capital of the Grand Duchy (until 1795), and of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Vilnius flourished under the commonwealth, especially after the 1579 establishment of [[Vilnius University]] by King [[Stephen Báthory]]. The city became a cultural and scientific center, attracting migrants from east and west. It had diverse communities, with Jewish, Orthodox, and German populations. The city experienced a number of invasions and occupations, including by the [[Teutonic Order|Teutonic Knights]], Russia and, later, Germany.

Under imperial Russian rule, Vilnius became the capital of [[Vilna Governorate]] and had a number of cultural revivals during the 19th and early 20th centuries by Jews, Poles, Lithuanians, and Belarusians. [[Second Polish Republic|After World War I]], the city experienced conflict between Poland and Lithuania which led to its occupation by Poland before its annexation by the Soviet Union during World War II. After that war, Vilnius became the capital of the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic]].

Vilnius is at the [[confluence]] of the [[Vilnia]] and [[Neris]] rivers in southeastern Lithuania. Several countries say that the [[geographical midpoint of Europe]] is within their territory. The midpoint depends on the definition of European extent, and the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' recognises a point near Vilnius as the continental centre.<ref name="gcentre">{{cite web |title=The geographical Centre of Europe |url=http://www.visitlithuania.net/index.php/places-to-visit/65-near-vilnius/94-the-geographical-centre-of-europe.html |website=visitlithuania.net |access-date=4 November 2019 |archive-date=4 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191104215727/http://www.visitlithuania.net/index.php/places-to-visit/65-near-vilnius/94-the-geographical-centre-of-europe.html |url-status=dead}}</ref> After a 1989 re-estimation of European boundaries, [[Jean-George Affholder]] of the [[Institut géographique national (France)|Institut Géographique National]] (French National Geographic Institute) determined that its geographic centre was at {{coord|54|54|N|25|19|E|type:landmark|name=Purnuškės (centre of gravity)}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://geosite.jankrogh.com/other.htm |title=Other Places of Interest: Central Europe |first=Jan S. |last=Krogh}}</ref> The method used to calculate the point was the [[centre of gravity]] of the European [[geometry|geometrical figure]], and is near the village of [[Girija (village)|Girija]] (26 kilometres from Vilnius).

Vilnius is {{cvt|312|km}} from the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Klaipėda]], the main Lithuanian [[Port|seaport]]. It is connected by road to other major Lithuanian cities, such as Kaunas ({{cvt|102|km|disp=or}} away), [[Šiauliai]] ({{cvt|214|km|disp=or}} away) and [[Panevėžys]] ({{cvt|135|km|disp=or}} away).

Vilnius has an area of {{cvt|402|km2|sqmi}}. Buildings cover 29.1 percent of the city; green space covers 68.8 percent, and water covers 2.1 percent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vilnius.lt/newvilniusweb/index.php/252/ |title=The City |publisher=City of Vilnius |access-date=30 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216013924/http://www.vilnius.lt/newvilniusweb/index.php/252/ |archive-date=16 December 2008}}</ref> The city has eight [[nature reserve]]s: Vokės Senslėnio Slopes Geomorphological Reserve, Aukštagiris Geomorphological Reserve, Valakupių Klonio Geomorphological Reserve, Veržuva Hydrographic Reserve, Vokė Hydrographic Reserve, Cedronas Upstream Landscape Reserve, Tapeliai Landscape Reserve, and Šeškinė Slopes Geomorphological Reserve.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gamtos paveldo apsauga |url=https://vilnius.lt/lt/savivaldybe/miesto-pletra/gamtos-paveldo-apsauga/ |website=vilnius.lt |access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref>

Summer days are warm to hot, especially in July and August, with daytime temperatures above {{cvt|30|°C|0}} during periodic heat waves. Outdoor bars, restaurants and cafés are frequented during the day.

Winters can be very cold, although temperatures above {{convert|0|°C|°F}}; still occasionally occur. Temperatures below {{cvt|-25|C|F}} are recorded every other year. Vilnius's rivers freeze in particularly cold winters, and the lakes surrounding the city are almost always frozen from December to March, and even April, in the most extreme years. The Lithuanian Hydrometeorological Service, headquartered in Vilnius, monitors the country's climate.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lithuanian Hydrometeorological Service |url=http://www.meteo.lt/en/ |website=meteo.lt |access-date=7 August 2020}}</ref>

Vilnius was an artistic centre of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, attracting artists across Europe. The oldest surviving early [[Gothic art|Gothic]] artworks (14th century) are paintings dedicated to churches and [[liturgy]], such as frescoes in the crypts of [[Vilnius Cathedral]] and decorated [[hymnal|hymnbooks]]. Sixteenth-century wall paintings are in the city's [[Church of St. Francis and St. Bernard, Vilnius|Church of St. Francis and St. Bernard]] and the [[Church of Saint Nicholas, Vilnius|Church of Saint Nicholas]].<ref name="tapybavle">{{cite web |title=Lietuvos tapyba |url=https://www.vle.lt/Straipsnis/Lietuvos-tapyba-117712 |website=vle.lt |access-date=10 November 2019 |language=lt}}</ref> Gothic wooden polychrome sculptures decorate church altars. Some Gothic [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] from the 14th and 15th centuries still exist, including those of [[Kęstutis]], [[Vytautas the Great]] and [[Sigismund II Augustus]].<ref name="skulptura">{{cite web |title=Lietuvos skulptūra |url=https://www.vle.lt/Straipsnis/Lietuvos-skulptura-118228 |website=vle.lt |access-date=10 November 2019 |language=lt}}</ref>

[[Renaissance]] sculpture appeared during the early 16th century, primarily by the [[Italy|Italian]] sculptors Bernardinus Zanobi da Gianotti, Giovani Cini, and Giovanni Maria Padovano. During the Renaissance, portrait tombstones and medals were valued; examples are the marble tombs of [[Albertas Goštautas]] (1548) and [[Paweł Holszański]] (1555) by [[Bernardino de Gianotis]] in Vilnius Cathedral. Italian sculpture is characterized by its naturalistic treatment of forms and precise proportions. Local sculptors adopted the iconographic scheme of Renaissance tombs; their works, such the tomb of [[Lew Sapieha]] ({{circa|1633}}) in the [[Church of St. Michael, Vilnius|Church of St. Michael]], are stylized.<ref name="skulptura" /> During this period, local and [[Western Europe]]an painters created religious and mythological compositions and portraits with late Gothic and Baroque features; illustrated prayerbooks, illustrations, and miniatures have survived.<ref name="tapybavle" />

During the late-16th-century [[Baroque]], wall painting developed. Most palaces and churches were decorated in frescoes with bright colors, sophisticated angles, and drama. Secular painting{{snd}}representational, imaginative, epitaph portraits, scenes of battles and politically important events in a detailed, realistic style{{snd}}also spread at this time.<ref name="tapybavle" /> Baroque sculptures dominated [[sacred architecture]]: tombstones with sculpted portraits and decorative sculptures in wood, marble, and [[stucco]]. Italian sculptors such as G. P. Perti, G. M. Galli, and A. S. Capone, key figures in the development of sculpture in the 17th-century grand duchy, were commissioned by [[Lithuanian nobility]]. Their works exemplify the mature Baroque, with expressive forms and sensuality. Local sculptors emphasized Baroque decorative features, with less expression and emotion.<ref name="skulptura" />

[[File:Rusiecki-Litwinka z wierzbami.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Painting of a young woman|''[[Lithuanian Girl with Palm Sunday Fronds]]'' by [[Kanuty Rusiecki]]]]
Lithuanian painting was influenced by the [[:lt:Vilniaus meno mokykla|Vilnius Art School]] during the late 18th and 19th centuries, which introduced [[Classicism|classical]] and [[Romanticism|romantic]] art. Painters had internships abroad, mainly in Italy. Allegorical, mythological compositions, landscapes, and portraits of representatives of various circles of society began, and historical themes prevailed. The era's best-known classical painters are [[Franciszek Smaglewicz]], [[Jan Rustem]], [[Józef Oleszkiew]], {{ill|Daniel Kondratowicz|pl}}, [[Józef Peszka]], and [[Wincenty Smokowski]]. Romantic artists were Jan Rustem, [[Jan Krzysztof Damel]], [[Wincenty Dmochowski]] and [[Kanuty Rusiecki]].<ref name="tapybavle" /> After the 1832 closure of Vilnius University, the Vilnius Art School continued to influence Lithuanian art.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vilniaus meno mokykla |url=http://alka.mch.mii.lt/menas/menomokykla/trumpa.lt.htm |website=alka.mch.mii.lt |access-date=10 November 2019 |archive-date=2 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202051320/http://alka.mch.mii.lt/menas/menomokykla/trumpa.lt.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Lithuanian Grand Dukes' entertainment at the castle, rulers' visits abroad and guests' meetings had theatrical elements. During [[Sigismund III Vasa]]'s residence in Vilnius in the early 17th century, English actors performed at the palace. Władysław IV Vasa established a professional opera theatre in the Lower Castle in 1635, where ''[[dramma per musica|drammas per musica]]'' were performed by the Italian Virgilio Puccitelli. The performances had basic, luxurious scenography.<ref>{{cite web |title=Seniausių laikų Lietuvos teatras |url=https://www.vle.lt/Straipsnis/seniausiu-laiku-Lietuvos-teatras-118076 |website=vle.lt |access-date=17 November 2019}}</ref>

A Jesuit School Theatre existed between the 16th and 18th centuries, with its first performance (''Hercules'' by S. Tucci) in 1570 in Vilnius. Baroque aesthetics prevailed at the theatre, which also had [[Middle Ages|medieval]] retrospectives, Renaissance elements, [[Rococo]] motifs, and an educational function. Performances were in Latin, but elements of the Lithuanian language were included and some of the works had Lithuanian themes ([[Play (theatre)|plays]] dedicated to [[Algirdas]], Mindaugas, Vytautas and other Lithuanian rulers).<ref>{{cite web |title=Mokyklinis teatras Lietuvos teritorijoje |url=https://www.vle.lt/Straipsnis/mokyklinis-teatras-Lietuvos-teritorijoje-118061 |website=vle.lt |access-date=17 November 2019}}</ref><ref name="theatrevle">{{cite web |title=Lietuvos teatras |url=https://www.vle.lt/Straipsnis/Lietuvos-teatras-124143 |website=vle.lt |access-date=17 November 2019}}</ref>

[[Wojciech Bogusławski]] established Vilnius City Theatre, the city's first public theatre, in 1785. The theatre, initially in the Oskierka Palace, moved to the [[Radziwiłł Palace, Vilnius|Radziwiłł Palace]] and [[Town Hall, Vilnius|Vilnius Town Hall]]. Plays were performed in Polish until 1845, from 1845 to 1864 in Polish and Russian, and after 1864 in Russian. After the Lithuanian-language ban was lifted, plays were also performed in Lithuanian. The theatre closed in 1914.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vilniaus miesto teatras |url=https://www.vle.lt/Straipsnis/Vilniaus-miesto-teatras-117908 |website=vle.lt |access-date=17 November 2019}}</ref>

During the interwar period (when the city was part of Poland), Vilnius was known for the modern, experimental Reduta troupe and institute led by [[Juliusz Osterwa]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Juliusz Osterwa |url=https://www.vle.lt/Straipsnis/Juliusz-Osterwa-656 |website=vle.lt |access-date=24 December 2019}}</ref> The Vilnius Lithuanian Stage Amateur Company ({{langx|lt|link=no|Vilniaus lietuvių scenos mėgėjų kuopa}}), established in 1930 and renamed Vilnius's Lithuanian Theatre, performed in the region. In 1945, it was merged with the [[Lithuanian National Drama Theatre]].<ref name="theatrevle" />

After the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in 1940, theatre became a means of disseminating Soviet ideology. Performances incorporated socialist realism, and a number of [[Russian Revolution|revolutionary]] plays by Russian authors were staged. A Repertory Commission was established under the Ministry of Culture to direct theatres, control repertoire, and permit (or ban) performances.<ref name="theatrevle" />

Theatre changed after Lithuanian independence.<ref name="theatrevle" /> The independent Vilnius City Opera blends classical and contemporary art. The Lithuanian National Drama Theatre, State Small Theatre of Vilnius, State Youth Theatre and a number of private theatre companies (including OKT/Vilnius City Theatre and the Anželika Cholina Dance Theatre) present classical, modern and Lithuanian plays directed by noted Lithuanian and foreign directors. There is also a Russian-language [[Old Theatre of Vilnius]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Events |url=http://www.teatrai.lt/events |website=teatrai.lt |access-date=17 November 2019}}</ref>

According to the memoirs of architect Bolesław Podczaszyński, published in January 1853 in the {{Lang|pl|[[Gazeta Warszawska]]}}, Lithuanian [[photography]] began with the [[Daguerreotype|daguerreotyping]] in the summer of 1839 of the reconstructed [[Verkiai Palace]] by François Marcillac (governor of the children of Duke [[Ludwig zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg|Ludwig Wittgenstein]]).<ref name="photovle">{{cite web |title=Lietuvos meninė fotografija |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/lietuvos-menine-fotografija/ |website=vle.lt |access-date=21 February 2021 |language=lt}}</ref> The country's unfavorable political situation hampered the development of new technology and cultural activities. The first known daguerreotype-portrait [[atelier]] in Vilnius was opened in 1843 by C. Ziegler, and ateliers operated in Lithuania until 1859. One of the best-known photographers was K. Neupert, from [[Norway]].<ref name="photovle"/>

In the 1860s, with the spread of the [[collodion process]], [[Photographic plate|glass negatives]] and [[albumen paper]] were used instead of daguerreotype plates. Photo portraits in standard formats became widespread, and commercial photography ateliers were established in Vilnius and other Lithuanian cities. The first landscape and architectural photographs were made by Vilnius photographers [[:lt: Abdonas Korzonas|Abdonas Korzonas]] and Albert Swieykowski, who compiled the 32-image ''Vilnius Album'' (Lithuania's first set of photographs). In 1862, Provisional Censorship Regulations governing the activities of photographic institutions were adopted in 1862, supervised by the Central Press Board of the Ministry of the Interior. Those who photographed the rebels in the [[January Uprising]] were punished; A. Korzonas was deported to [[Siberia]]. Other prominent 19th-century photographers were [[:lt:Stanislovas Filibertas Fleris|Stanisław Filibert Fleury]] (a [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]]-photography pioneer),<ref>{{cite web |title=Stanislovas Filibertas Fleris |url=https://www.limis.lt/personaliju-zodynas/-/personFastSearch/view/869771 |website=limis.lt |access-date=7 March 2021 |language=lt}}</ref> Aleksander Władysław Strauss, and [[:lt:Juzefas Čechavičius|Józef Czechowicz]].<ref name="photovle"/>

During the [[feudalism|feudal]] era, home [[crafts]] were components of a [[subsistence economy]]. During the 13th and 14th centuries, crafts became a branch of the economy separate from agriculture. The Grand Dukes of Lithuania promoted the development of crafts in cities, and weaving, shoemaking, fur-making and other crafts predominated. With the early-14th-century introduction of foreign artisans, the development of crafts accelerated; crafts and trade stimulated the growth of Vilnius and other Lithuanian cities. In the 14th and 15th centuries, crafts were specialized (especially the production of tools, household items, fabrics, clothing, weapons, and jewelry); [[workshop]]s were established which trained and defended the interests of craftspeople. Production of fine [[glassware]] began, [[goldsmithing]] was developed, and the level of pottery and weaving rose during the 16th century, and the 1529 and 1588 Statutes of Lithuania identify 25 crafts.<ref name="amatai"/> European goldsmiths worked in the [[Vilnius Goldsmiths' Workshop]] (established in 1495), which controlled trade in [[precious metal]]s and [[gemstone]]s and served the [[Daugava]] and [[Dnieper]] regions, the [[Catholic Church in Lithuania|Catholic Church]], the Grand Duke, the [[Szlachta|nobility]], and townspeople.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vilniaus auksakalių cechas |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/vilniaus-auksakaliu-cechas/ |website=vle.lt |access-date=21 February 2021 |language=lt}}</ref> The [[Vilnius Mint]], the main [[Mint (facility)|mint]] of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, minted the Lithuanian [[denarius]], [[shilling]]s, [[groschen]], [[thaler]]s, [[ducat]]s, and other coins from 1387 to 1666.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vilniaus monetų kalykla |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/vilniaus-monetu-kalykla/ |website=vle.lt |access-date=21 February 2021 |language=lt}}</ref>

Crafting declined in the second half of the 17th century due to the [[Russo-Polish War (1654–1667)|Russo-Polish War]], and most goods were imported and sold by Lithuanian and Polish nobles. It revived from the second half of the 18th century to the first half of the 19th century, with Vilnius the largest Lithuanian craft center. After the abolition of [[serfdom]], craft schools were established in Lithuanian cities; crafts have prevailed in [[clothing]] manufacturing, goldsmithing, woodworking, food processing, and other fields. Under Soviet occupation, craftspeople worked in [[artel]]s until 1960 and then in [[Combine (enterprise)|combines]]. After independence, crafts were produced by small and medium-sized businesses.<ref name="amatai"/>

[[File:Krzysztof Mikołaj "the Thunderbolt" Radziwiłł 1.PNG|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Painting of an older, bearded man|[[Krzysztof "Piorun" Radziwiłł]] was [[Voivode of Vilnius]] from 1584 to 1603. After his victories against [[Ivan the Terrible]] during the [[Livonian War]], he was nicknamed "the Thunderbolt".]]
Before [[Magdeburg rights]] were granted to Vilnius in 1378, the city was ruled by [[vicegerent]]s. Government was later granted to a magistrate or a city council, subordinate to the ruler. In wartime, it was led by a [[Voivode of Vilnius|voivode]].<ref name="government">{{cite web |author1=Antanas Rimvydas Čaplinskas|author1-link=Antanas Rimvydas Čaplinskas |title=Vilniaus istorija: kas vadovavo miestui? |url=http://klaipeda.diena.lt/naujienos/laisvalaikis-ir-kultura/zvaigzdes-ir-pramogos/vilniaus-istorija-kas-vadovavo-miestui-601723 |website=Klaipeda.diena.lt |date=21 March 2010 |access-date=21 March 2010}}</ref> The government headquarters was at Vilnius Town Hall.<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=https://www.vilniausrotuse.lt/en/history |website=Vilniausrotuse.lt |access-date=31 October 2019}}</ref>

The magistrate was responsible for the city's economy: collecting taxes, overseeing the treasury, and accumulating stocks of grain to avoid starvation during famine or wars. He was a [[notary]] in transactions and testaments, a [[judge]] in conflicts involving construction and renovation, and took care of craftspeople; statutes involving workshops were approved by the ruler, but Sigismund II Augustus gave this responsibility to magistrates in 1552. Since a 1522 ruling by [[Sigismund I the Old]], Vilnius magistrates had to protect the city and its residents with 24 armed guards. During wartime, the night watch was conducted by the magistrate, bishop and castle men.<ref name="government" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Magistratas |url=https://www.vle.lt/Straipsnis/magistratas-10763 |website=[[Vle.lt]] |access-date=5 November 2019 |language=lt}}</ref>

The chief city administrator was a Catholic ''vaitas'' (a vicegerent of the Grand Duke of Lithuania),<ref>{{cite web |title=Vaitas |url=https://www.vle.lt/Straipsnis/vaitas-98877 |website=Vle.lt |access-date=5 November 2019 |language=lt}}</ref> most of whom were beginning their careers in the magistracy, and chaired city-council meetings. He adjudicated [[criminal case]]s, with the right to impose capital punishment. Originally examining cases alone, two ''suolininkai'' also began examining important cases in the 16th century. At that time, the city council consisted of 12 [[burgomaster]]s and 24 councilors; half were Catholics, the other half [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]]). Members were chosen by wealthy townspeople, merchants, and workshop elders. Burgomasters were lifetime appointments; at death, another member of the council with the same religion was chosen. In 1536, Sigismund I the Old signed an edict prohibiting close relatives on the council and requiring prior agreement by the townspeople of new taxes, obligations and regulations.<ref name="government" />

===Urbanism and architecture===

The Old Town covers about {{cvt|3.6|km2}}, and its history dates to the [[Neolithic]]. The glacial hills were intermittently occupied, and a wooden castle was built at the confluence of the Neris and Vilnia {{circa|1000 AD}} to fortify [[Gedimino Hill]]. The settlement developed into a town in the 13th century, when the [[pagan]] [[Baltic people]] were invaded by [[Western Europeans]] during the [[Lithuanian Crusade]]. Around 1323 (the first written sources about Vilnia), it was the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and had a few brick buildings. By the 15th century, the duchy extended from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to the [[Black Sea]] (primarily present-day Belarus, Ukraine and Russia). The historic centre consists of [[Vilnius Castle Complex|three castles]] (Upper, Lower and Curved) and the area previously encircled by the [[Wall of Vilnius]]. It is mainly circular, centered on the original castle site. Streets are small and narrow, with large squares later developed.<ref name="unesco" /> [[Pilies Street]], the main artery, links the Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania with Vilnius Town Hall. Other streets are lined with the palaces of feudal lords and landlords, churches, shops and craftspeople's workrooms.

Historic buildings feature [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Gotika |url=http://www.ivilnius.lt/apie-vilniu/architektura/gotika/ |website=iVilnius.lt |access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref> [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Renesansas |url=http://www.ivilnius.lt/apie-vilniu/architektura/renesansas/ |website=iVilnius.lt |access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref> [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Barokas |url=http://www.ivilnius.lt/apie-vilniu/architektura/barokas/ |website=iVilnius.lt |access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref> and [[classical architecture]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Klasicizmas |url=http://www.ivilnius.lt/apie-vilniu/architektura/klasicizmas/ |website=iVilnius.lt |access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref> The variety of preserved churches and former palaces of the Lithuanian nobility exemplifies Vilnius' multicultural heritage.<ref name="unesco" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Vilniaus architektūra |url=https://www.vle.lt/Straipsnis/Vilniaus-architektura-125335 |website=vle.lt |access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref>

Lithuanians and others shaped the development of the capital, with Western and Eastern influences. Lithuania was [[Christianization of Lithuania|Christianized]] in 1387, but Eastern Orthodoxy and the growing importance of [[Judaism]] led to construction of the [[Cathedral of the Theotokos, Vilnius|Orthodox Cathedral of the Theotokos]] and the [[Great Synagogue of Vilna]]).<ref name="unesco" />

The {{convert|352|ha|acre|adj=on}} Old Town was designated as a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1994. The Vilnius Historic Centre is noted for maintaining its medieval street pattern with no significant gaps. Some places were damaged during Lithuania's occupations and wars, including [[Cathedral Square, Vilnius|Cathedral Square]] (demolished in 1795) and a square east of the [[Church of All Saints, Vilnius|Church of All Saints]] where the [[Church of St. Joseph the Betrothed, Vilnius|Convent of the Barefoot Carmelites]] stood with [[Deputy Chancellor of Lithuania|Vice-Chancellor]] [[Stefan Pac]]'s Baroque [[Church of St. Joseph the Betrothed, Vilnius|Church of St. Joseph the Betrothed]] (both demolished by the [[tsar]].

In the eldership of [[Vilkpėdė]], remnants of a [[Magdalenian]] settlement were found which date to {{circa|10000 BC}}. Kairėnai, Pūčkoriai and Naujoji Vilnia had large settlements during the first millennium AD.<ref name="historyvle">{{cite web |title=Vilniaus istorija |url=https://www.vle.lt/Straipsnis/Vilniaus-istorija-125336 |website=vle.lt |access-date=8 November 2019 |language=lt}}</ref> The most densely-populated area was the confluence of the Neris and Vilnia, which had fortified homesteads.<ref name="historyvle" />

According to some historians, Vilnius could have been a city during the [[Kingdom of Lithuania]] times: King [[Mindaugas]] did not permanently live there, however, may have built Lithuania's first Catholic church for his [[coronation]] there. It is well established, however, that Vilnius existed as a city during the times of [[Traidenis]] and [[Vytenis]]. The first mention in the historical sources as a capital in 1323 in the [[Letters of Gediminas|letters to the Western cities]] of [[Gediminas]].

It became a multicultural city, with 14th-century sources noting that it consisted of a Great (Lithuanian) city and a [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] one. By the 16th century, [[Germans|German]] merchants, artisans, Jews and [[Tatars]] had also settled in Vilnius. During the 16th– and 17th-century [[Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]], the city's Polish-speaking population began to grow; by the middle of the 17th century, most writing was in Polish.<ref name="historyvle"/> City was inhabited by a large number of [[Italians|Italian]] and [[Swiss people|Swiss]] artisans as well and generally all the European nations were presented to an extent (those included [[Vilnius university]] professors and students among whom there were [[French people|French]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]], [[Swedes]] and even some [[Croatians]] as Tomaš Zdelarius, musicians at the [[Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania]] or such military servants as [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] [[Gáspár Bekes]]). Because of many nations inhabiting the city, in the 16th-18th. centuries it was known and nicknamed in Western sources as [[Babylon]] of Europe.<ref name="S. Bodniak 1930 p. 37">Especially in the 16th–17th centuries, Vilnius was called the ‘New Babylon’ because of the many languages spoken there, as well as its many religions (various Christian denominations as well as Jews and a Muslim Tatar community). E.g.: S. Bodniak, "Polska w relacji włoskiej z roku 1604", Pamiętnik biblioteki kórnickiej, 2, (Kórnik, 1930), p. 37.</ref>

By the inter-war period, after the brief [[Polish–Lithuanian War]] and the annexation of the so-called [[Republic of Central Lithuania]] by Poland, the population became overwhelmingly Polish with very significant Jewish minority. Because of the annexation, the 1931 Polish census recorded only 0.8% Lithuanians. After World War II, the number of ethnic Lithuanians in Vilnius rebounded; however, Lithuanization was soon replaced with [[Sovietization of the Baltic states|Sovietization]].<ref name="diana427">{{cite web |last=Janušauskienė |first=Diana |title=Tolerancijos apraiškos Lietuvoje: vertybinės nuostatos tautinių mažumų atžvilgiu |date=1 October 2012 |page=427 |url=https://www.mruni.eu/upload/iblock/814/002_Janusauskiene.pdf |access-date=14 January 2020 |archive-date=17 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181117152513/https://www.mruni.eu/upload/iblock/814/002_Janusauskiene.pdf |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Snyder 92-93">{{cite book |last=Snyder |first=Timothy |title=The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569–1999 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-300-10586-5 |pages=92–93}}</ref>, and the population became a mix of Lithuanians, Russians and Poles.
