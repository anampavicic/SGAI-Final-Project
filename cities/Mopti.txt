'''Mopti''' ([[Bambara language|Bambara]]: ߡߏߕߌ tr. Moti) is a town and an [[Communes of Mali|urban commune]] in the [[Inner Niger Delta]] region of [[Mali]]. The town is the capital of the [[Mopti Cercle]] and the [[Mopti Region]]. Situated 630&nbsp;km northeast of [[Bamako]], the town lies at the [[Confluence (geography)|confluence]] of the [[River Niger|Niger]] and the [[Bani River|Bani]] Rivers and is linked by an elevated causeway to the town of [[Sévaré]]. The urban commune, which includes both Mopti and Sévaré, had a population of 114,296 in the 2009 census.

==Geography==
Mopti lies on the right bank of the [[Bani River]], a few hundred meters upstream of the confluence of the Bani with the [[Niger River]]. Between August and December when the rivers flood the [[Inner Niger Delta]], the town becomes a series of islands connected by raised causeways. During this period the only road access to the town is along a 12&nbsp;km causeway that links Mopti to [[Sévaré]]. Mopti lies to the west of the Dogon Plateau and is 66&nbsp;km northwest of [[Bandiagara]] and 76&nbsp;km north-northeast of [[Djenné]].<!--all distances as the crow flies--> The town is the capital of the [[Mopti Region]] and the administrative center of the [[Mopti Cercle]].

The urban commune of Mopti includes the towns of both Mopti and Sévaré. The commune is completely surrounded by the rural commune of [[Socoura]]. At the time of the 2009 census the population of the Mopti commune was 114,296. For administrative purposes the commune is subdivided into 11 ''quartiers'': Komoguel I, Komoguel II, Gangal, Toguel, Bougoufié, Mossinkoré, Taïkiri, Médina Coura, Sévaré I, Sévaré II, and Sévaré III. The seat of the commune, the Hôtel de Ville de Mopti, is in Komoguel I.<ref name=csa/>

==History==
The town of Mopti derives its name from the [[Fulfulde]] word for gathering.<ref>From the Fula root ''mooɓ-'' plus "[[Fula language#Morphology|infix]]" ''-t-''. In the verbal infinitive for this may be pronounced ''mo(o)ɓtude'', ''mo(o)ptude'', or ''mo(o)ttude''.</ref> The name replaced the earlier [[Bozo language|Bozo]] name of ''Sagan''.<ref>{{citation | last1= Dorier-Apprill | first1= Élisabeth | last2= Van den Avenne | first2= Cécile | year=2002 | title=Usages toponymiques et pratiques de l'espace urbain à Mopti (Mali) | journal= Marges Linguistiques | volume=3 |pages=151–158 | url=http://gsite.univ-provence.fr/gsite/Local/geographie/dir/user-210/articles/dorier-apprill_van_den_avenne.pdf | language=fr  }}.

The inhabitants grew rice on the floodplains, herded livestock and fished with cotton nets. Large quantities of the dried fish were traded in Djenné and other markets. The women made a "beautiful kind of pottery" which they sold in Djenné and to boats heading for Timbuktu.<ref name=caillie1830/> Two centuries later, the cultivation of rice is still very important to the local economy, dried fish are exported over a large part of West Africa and pottery is still shipped from the port.<ref name=viguier2008/>

Due to the limited land available, Mopti became more densely built than most Malian cities with many multi-story buildings and narrow streets. Originally, the islands were much smaller than they are today; first linked by dykes in the early twentieth century, the areas around and between natural islands have been gradually filled and raised—often by deposition of household trash, a process that still continues today in areas such as the western edge of the Old Town.<ref name=dorier2002>{{citation | last=Dorier-Apprill | first= Élisabeth | year=2002 | title=Gestion de l'environnement urbain et municipalisation en Afrique de l'Ouest : le cas de Mopti (Mali) | journal= Autrepart | volume=21 |pages=119–134 | url=http://gsite.univ-provence.fr/gsite/Local/geographie/dir/user-210/articles/2002_DORIER_gestion_environnement_municipalisation_Mopti.pdf | language=fr | publisher=Institut de Recherche pour le Développement | place=Marseille, France | doi=10.3917/autr.021.0119}}.</ref>

In 2002, Mopti was one of several Malian cities to host the Cup of African Nations tournament.  A large, modern stadium was constructed for this event.

During the [[Northern Mali conflict|2012 Northern Mali Conflict]], when Islamists took over most of Northern Mali, Mopti was one of the most northerly towns that remained under government control.<ref name=Hirsch2012>{{citation | last=Hirsch | first=Afua | date= 8 November 2012 | title=Mali's long wait to reclaim the north from Islamists | publisher=BBC News | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20243883  | access-date=11 November 2012 }}.</ref>

[[Amadou Toumani Touré]], a former president of Mali, is a native of Mopti.

==Mosque==
{{main| Mopti Grand Mosque }}

The Great Mosque (also called the Komoguel Mosque) is an example of [[Sudano-Sahelian architecture]]. The present building was constructed on the site of an earlier mosque dating from 1908 but sources differ on the exact date. The web site of the [[World Heritage Sites|UNESCO World Heritage Convention]] gives a period of between 1933 and 1935<ref name=unesco>{{citation | title= La Mosquée de Komoguel | url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5442/ | publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Convention | access-date=20 September 2012 | language=fr}}.</ref> while the [[Aga Khan Development Network]] gives the slightly later period of between 1936 and 1943.<ref name=akdn>{{citation | title=Restauration de la Grande Mosquée de Mopti | url=http://www.akdn.org/fran%C3%A7ais/press_release.asp?idlng=1&id=154 | publisher=Aga Khan Development Network | date=1 August 2005 | access-date=20 September 2012 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106234621/http://www.akdn.org/fran%C3%A7ais/press_release.asp?idlng=1&id=154 | archive-date=6 November 2013 }}.</ref> The design was based on that of the [[Great Mosque of Djenné]] and is constructed using sun-dried mud bricks which are covered with a layer of banco. In restoration work carried out in 1978, the upper parts of the building were covered with a layer of cement but this later proved to be problematic as rain water penetrated the cement layer and created large fissures in the underlying mud structure.  In the restoration carried out between 2004 and 2006 funded by the [[Aga Khan Trust for Culture]], the cement layer was removed and the building restored to its original form.<ref name=akdn/> The mosque was added to the UNESCO Tentative List of World Heritage Sites in March 2009.<ref name=unesco/>

==Industry==
[[File:Port de Mopti.png|thumb|right|280px|Port of Mopti]]
Mopti is the region's commercial center and Mali's most important port; markets around its harbour sell rock salt from [[Taoudenni]], among many other goods. Fishing, herding, and agriculture (particularly rice production) also continue to be important to the local economy.

===Tourism===
Mopti is popular with tourists, having an active [[river port]], a [[mosque]], and across the Niger, small fishing villages.  Attractions in Mopti include [[Mopti Grand Mosque]] and the nearby [[Dogon people|Pays Dogon]].  There are several popular hotels, the Hotel Kanaga, Hotel Y a pas de Problème, and Hotel Ambedjele which is on the road to [[Sévaré]].

During the [[2012 Northern Mali conflict]], most Western tourists stayed away from the region, even though Mopti was not in rebel hands. However, the conflict had a mixed effect on the town as dispossessed people from the rebel-held area came to Mopti and boosted some parts of the economy.<ref name=Hirsch2012/>

==Transport==
The port of Mopti is served by ferries operated by the Compagnie Malienne de Navigation (COMANAV). The ferries run between August and December when the depth of water in the river is sufficient. They carry both freight and passengers between [[Koulikoro]] (59&nbsp;km downstream from [[Bamako]]) and [[Gao]], a distance of 1308&nbsp;km.<ref>{{citation | last=Diarra | first=Adama | date=3 July 2012 | title=Crise du Nord: La COMANAV prend l'eau | url=http://www.essor.ml/regions/article/crise-du-nord-la-comanav-prend-l | newspaper=L'Essor | language=fr | access-date=27 September 2012 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029044129/http://essor.ml/regions/article/crise-du-nord-la-comanav-prend-l | archive-date=29 October 2012 }}</ref> Both passengers and freight are also transported by ''pinasses'', large wooden canoe shaped vessels, that are privately operated.

Mopti is connected by a 12&nbsp;km elevated causeway to Sévaré which  lies on the Route Nationale 16 (RN16), the bitumen surfaced road that links Bamako in the west to Gao in the east. There is an airport at Sévaré.

==Culture==
The city is the subject of a 1999 documentary film, ''[[L'Esprit de Mopti]]''.<ref name="Olivier Barlet">{{cite news|last=Barlet|first=Olivier|title=L'Esprit de Mopti|url=http://www.afribd.com/article.php?no=3047|access-date=13 March 2012|newspaper=Africultures|language=fr}}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It is also the birthplace of [[Slovak people|Slovak]] celebrity [[Ibrahim Maiga]].
