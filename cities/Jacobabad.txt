'''Jacobabad''' ({{langx|ur|{{nq|جیکب آباد}}}} and {{langx|sd|{{naskh|جيڪب آباد}}}}; formerly '''Khanger''' or '''Khangarh''') is a city in [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]], serving as both the capital city of [[Jacobabad District]] and the [[administrative centre]] of [[Jacobabad Taluka]], an administrative [[tehsil|subdivision]] of the district. The city itself is subdivided into eight [[Union Councils of Pakistan|Union Councils]]. Sitting far to the northwest of the province, near the provincial boundaries of Sindh and [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], Jacobabad became a city on the site of an existing village (Khangarh), and is crossed by the [[Pakistan Railways]] and many main roads of the province. It is the [[List of cities in Pakistan by population|43rd most populous city in Pakistan]].

The city is one of the hottest places on earth, with summer temperatures regularly rising to a mean temperature of {{cvt|37|C}}.<ref name="Bombay1857" /> In particular, compounded by the humidity and [[Climate change in Pakistan|climate change]], Jacobabad has several times exceeded a [[wet-bulb temperature]] of {{cvt|35|C}}, above which the human body cannot sufficiently cool itself.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Farmer|first=Ben|date=2021-06-28|title=Hotter than the human body can handle: Pakistan city broils in world's highest temperatures|language=en-GB|work=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/climate-and-people/hotter-human-body-can-handle-pakistan-city-broils-worlds-highest/|access-date=2021-07-15|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Jacobabad has been cited as one of the world's most vulnerable places to global warming, and one where the difference between 1.5&nbsp;°C and 2&nbsp;°C can be the difference between life and death.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Atkin |first=Emily |date=2022-03-31 |title=The Meaning of Half a Degree: A New Way to Think about Climate Change |url=https://www.gq.com/story/eight-places-to-save-climate-change |access-date=2022-03-31 |website=GQ |language=en-US}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The city is named after [[Brigadier-General]] [[John Jacob (East India Company officer)|John Jacob]] [[Order of the Bath|CB]] (1812–1858), an officer of the [[British East India Company]] who ruled this region during the last decade of his life. He is also known for the cavalry regiment called [[36th Jacob's Horse]]. Jacob was a graduate of [[Addiscombe Military Seminary]]. He was commissioned into the [[Bombay Artillery]] ([[Bombay Army]]) on his 16th birthday, and subsequently sailed for India in January 1828, never to set foot in England again. According to travel writer Salman Rashid, it was local residents "who took to calling the new settlement ‘Jekumbad’", later renamed to Jacobabad by the British rulers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2023}} The scale of progress and prosperity Jacob's works brought to the region can be appreciated by comparing those regions' relative prosperity at the time, compared to areas which were not under his administrative jurisdiction.<ref name="dawn.com">{{Cite web | url=http://www.dawn.com/news/720466/remembering-general-john-jacob-an-able-administrator-and-a-master-planne |title = Remembering General John Jacob – an able administrator and a master planner|date = 22 May 2012}}</ref>

==History==

In 1847 Jacob was placed in political charge of the frontier and established his headquarters at the village of Khangurh (or Khanger). He started building infrastructure for the town around the village. Being an architect and an engineer himself, he designed and then executed the plans of laying a wide road network around the town that measured a good 600 miles (965&nbsp;km). In that he resolved the problem of unavailability of potable water for the residents by excavating a tank that contained water brought from Indus through a canal. His biggest and most important feat was the excavation of Begaree Canal, originating from Guddu barrage on river [[Indus]], going round the district irrigating thousands of acres of land previously uncultivated, thereby providing means of living to thousands of people.<ref name="dawn.com"/>

After the [[British Raj]], the city was ruled by a [[Sardar]], Taj Dero Khan Odho.

In November 2010, then [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]] announced that University of Information Technology would be established in Jacobabad.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thenews.com.pk/NewsDetail.aspx?ID=6278 |title=Jacobabad to have IT university: PM  |work=thenews.com.pk |access-date=27 January 2012}}</ref>

==Climate==
Jacobabad has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh'') with extremely hot summers and mild winters. The city is well known for consistently having among the highest temperature in [[South Asia]], with a mean summer temperature of {{cvt|37|C}}.<ref name="Bombay1857">{{cite book|author=Medical and Physical Society of Bombay|title=Transactions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2COgAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA116|access-date=17 March 2011|year=1857}}</ref> The highest recorded temperature is {{convert|52.8|°C|°F}}, and the lowest recorded temperature is {{convert|-3.9|°C|°F}}. Rainfall is low and mainly occurs in the monsoon season (July–September). The average annual rainfall of Jacobabad is 202.5&nbsp;mm as per 1991-2020 period. The highest annual rainfall ever is 838.7&nbsp;mm, recorded in 2022, and the lowest annual rainfall ever is 3.3&nbsp;mm, recorded in 1922.

In the [[2022 heat wave in India and Pakistan|2022 South Asian heat wave]], Jacobabad's mean temperature for the month of May broke the all-time record with {{convert|43|°C|°F}}, reaching or exceeding {{convert|50|°C|°F}} on four days. The city struggles to provide heat-mitigation measures. Many residents who are able to, migrate to higher-elevation [[Quetta]] during the summer school break.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Tunio |first1=Zoha |title=In Jacobabad, One of the Hottest Cities on the Planet, a Heat Wave Is Pushing the Limits of Human Livability |url=https://insideclimatenews.org/news/20062022/jacobabad-pakistan-heat-health/ |access-date=25 June 2022 |work=Inside Climate News |date=22 June 2022}}</ref>

== Airport and airbase ==
The commercial airport at Jacobabad, about {{convert|300|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} north of [[Karachi]] and {{convert|300|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Kandahar]], is located on the border between [[Sindh]] and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] provinces. The [[PAF Base Shahbaz|Shahbaz Air Base]] (co-located with the commercial airport in Jacobabad) was one of three Pakistani air bases used by U.S. and allied forces to support the [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] campaign in [[Afghanistan]] and reportedly ongoing [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] strikes in [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas|North Western Pakistan tribal regions]].<ref>{{cite web|title=CIA drones quit one Pakistan site – but US keeps access to other airbases|url=http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2011/12/15/cia-drones-quit-pakistan-site-but-us-keeps-access-to-other-airbases/|work=The Bureau of Investigative Journalism|access-date=24 March 2013|archive-date=3 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403052845/http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2011/12/15/cia-drones-quit-pakistan-site-but-us-keeps-access-to-other-airbases/|url-status=dead}}</ref>
