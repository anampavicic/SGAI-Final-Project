'''Villavicencio''' ({{IPA|es|biʎaβiˈsensjo}}) is a [[city]] and [[municipality]] in [[Colombia]]. The capital of [[Meta Department]], it was founded on April 6, 1840. The municipality had a population of 531,275 in 2018.<ref name="dane.gov.co"/> The city is located at 4°08'N, 73°40'W, 75&nbsp;km (about 45&nbsp;mi) southeast of the Colombian capital city of [[Bogotá]] (DC) by the [[Guatiquía River]]. It is the most important commercial center in the Llanos Orientales (Eastern plains) of Colombia. 

Villavicencio has a hot and very wet climate, with average daily temperatures ranging from {{convert|21|to|30|°C|°F}} and an annual rainfall of around {{convert|4500|mm|in|-1|disp=or}}. It is affectionately called "Villavo" la bella. Villavicencio lies on the great Colombian-Venezuelan plain called the [[Llanos]], situated to the east of the [[Andes]] mountains. Villavicencio is also called "La Puerta al Llano", or "The Gateway to the Plains", due to its location on the historical path from the Colombian interior to the vast [[savanna]]s that lie between the Andes range and the [[Amazon rainforest]].

Villavicencio's proximity to huge mountains and great plains make the city an example of Colombia's [[geodiversity]]. Because it is located in the foothills of the Andes, the morning and evening breezes cool the city, which is very hot for most of the day.

==History==
The German [[Conquistador]] [[Nikolaus Federmann]] reached the [[altiplano]] of Bogotá in 1536 by approaching it from the plains of [[Venezuela]], a large unsettled area that is formed by the [[Orinoco|Orinoco basin]]. However, the vast area of these plains remained unexplored and uncolonized for the next 300 years. Colombia was settled along the mountainous folds of the [[Magdalena River|Magdalena]] and [[Cauca River|Cauca]] valleys, and its commerce with the outside world was oriented towards the [[Caribbean Sea]], thus, because of its mountainous barriers, the extreme heat, and inhospitable climate, the Llanos remained forgotten and unsettled for many decades.

The [[Llanero]]s, the inhabitants of the plains, are fierce horsemen who first fought for the Spanish royalists and then for the Venezuelan and Colombian rebels during the [[History of Colombia#Gran Colombia: Independence Achieved|War of Independence]].{{citation needed|date=April 2021}} During [[Bolívar's campaign to liberate New Granada|independence]], they crossed the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Cordillera Oriental]] with Simón Bolívar, and surprised the [[Royalist (Hispanic American Revolution)|royalist army]] on the plains of Boyaca on the 6th of August, 1819, which cleared the way for the taking of an abandoned Santa Fe de Bogotá the next week.

In the 1840s, some farmers from [[Caqueza]], a town on the eastern folds of Bogotá, started the modest settlement of Gramalote, which would officially become the parish of Villavicencio in 1855. The parish was named for [[Antonio Villavicencio]], a patriot in the [[Patria Boba|Colombian war of independence]]. Vaccines, a mule road, and the availability of vast areas of free land, drove new colonizers to continue the settlement of Villavicencio. As the roads improved the access to the Llanos, the farmers could send their produce and cattle to the markets of Bogotá.

In 1948, large landowners expelled many farmers out of their lands across the country, explained in part by the momentum of the assassination of [[Jorge Eliecer Gaitan]], a popular [[Colombian Liberal Party|Liberal]] politician.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} The Llaneros resisted by driving the army out of population centers. The guerrillas never took Villavicencio, but they brought the fighting to the military base of [[Apiay]]. As the fighting between the government and the Llanero guerrillas was out of control, a military coup in June 1953, took [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla]] to power who immediately negotiated a cease fire and amnesty for the insurgents.

=== 1948–present ===
Villavicencio has grown from a small settlement of no more than 20 people in the 1850s to a settlement of over 500,000 inhabitants in 2018. A new road of bridges and tunnels has shortened the driving time to Bogotá from two or three hours, depending on the season of the year, to one and half hours to move the oil, cattle, and agricultural products faster.

==Geography==
[[File:Sunset Villavicencio.jpg|thumb|Sunset villavicencio]]
The city is located in the Orinoquia region, where the Oriental Plains begin. Most of the city's land is flat ground draining away from the Andes. The Guatiquia borders the city to the north and east. Caqueza and Chipaque are located northwest of Villavicencio. A true portal to the Llanos,  the roads south of Villavicencio lead to Acacias and San Martin, the first historical town of the Llanos, which was an early Jesuit settlement. East of Villavo they point towards Apiay, Puerto Lopez and the fluvial port of Orocue on the Meta river, a strong affluent of the Orinoco.

== Hydrography ==
Villavicencio, capital of the Department of [[Meta Department|Meta]], lies on the slopes of the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Cordillera]] a few blocks from the mighty Guatiquía River, surrounded by streams and creeks such as the Parrado and Gramalote, the [[Ocoa River|Ocoa]] to the east and the Negro and Guayuriba rivers to the south. Among the main tributaries that irrigate the jurisdiction of Villavicencio are the [[Guatiquía River|Guatiquía]], Guayuriba, Negro and Ocoa rivers. [[File:GUATIQUIA RIVER.jpg|thumb|GUATIQUIA RIVER]]

==Climate==
Villavicencio has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Af''). The climate is hot and sometimes humid, though its proximity to the foothills of the Oriental Andes brings mild breezes to the city at nightfall. Average temperature is {{convert|25.6|C|F|1|disp=or}}. Although January is almost dry enough for [[tropical monsoon climate|tropical monsoon]] (''Am'') classification, the other eleven months all receive over {{convert|130|mm|in|0|disp=or}} of rain, and for eight months from April to November monthly rainfall consistently exceeds {{convert|400|mm|in|0|disp=or}}.

==Economy==

In recent years the city has achieved an economic development strengthened by the trade sector, thanks to the dynamics generated by the roads that channel to the interior and the center of the country the agricultural and agro-industrial industry of the Llano, as well as the products entering the region from different parts of Colombia. Construction activity is very important. Gas and oil exploitation in the Apiay field are part of the region's mining activity.
[[Cattle]], [[agriculture]],  and the exportation of [[crude oil]] fuel the Villavicencio economy. Imports from the surrounding area include [[coffee]], [[banana]]s, and [[rice]].

[[La Vanguardia Airport]] serves Villavicencio with flights to the rest of Colombia on four airlines, including Colombian major airlines [[Avianca]] and [[Latam Colombia]].

Villavicencio continues to be the main collection and supply center for the municipalities of Villavicencio and the municipalities of the Colombian Orinoco region, as well as the main [[oil and gas]]-producing municipality; however, most of the jobs are being generated in commercial and service activities, that is, in non-productive and non-tradable sectors. Large constructions, roads, financial resources, and tourism revolve around these commercial dynamics and services. This means that the department's contribution to the National GDP is less than 2%, a figure that has been maintained over the last 49 years, that is, from 1960 to 2009.<ref>{{cite web |last1=S.A.S |title=Economía |url=http://historico.villavicencio.gov.co/MiMunicipio/Paginas/Economia.aspx |website=Alcaldía de Villavicencio}}</ref>

== Tourism ==
Villavicencio's tourism activity has been the result of progress in commercial activity and services; in other words, its growth depends on commercial dynamics, the services provided, and the efforts of municipal and departmental administrations. Tourism is carried out in both urban and rural areas (corregimientos) and has grown in both sectors.
Due to the growing interest in tourism in the region, the highways have been modernized and improved, shortening the driving time and distance to the capital Bogotá. As a result, Villavicencio and other adjacent municipalities ([[Acacías]], [[Cubarral]], [[Cumaral]], [[Restrepo, Meta|Restrepo]], [[Puerto López, Meta|Puerto Lopéz]], [[Puerto Gaitán]], [[Cáqueza]]) are growing in popularity as tourist destinations. In preparation to meet this demand, tourism development plans and strategies are implemented by the departmental and municipal governments, as well as the Cotelco branch. In relation to physical infrastructure, the city has an acceptable hotel inventory, as well as agro-tourism properties.<ref>{{cite web |title=Economía |url=http://historico.villavicencio.gov.co/MiMunicipio/Paginas/Economia.aspx |access-date=22 November 2021}}</ref>
