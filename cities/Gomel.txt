'''Gomel'''<ref>{{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|oʊ|m|əl}} {{respell|GOH|məl}}; [http://www.dictionary.com/browse/gomel "Gomel"] ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> ({{langx|ru|Гомель}}, {{IPA|ru|ˈɡomʲɪlʲ|IPA}}) or '''Homyel'''<!--See WP:BELARUSIANNAMES--> ({{langx|be|Гомель|Homieĺ}},{{efn|[[Instruction on transliteration of Belarusian geographical names with letters of Latin script|Official transliteration (2023)]].}} {{IPA-be|ˈɣomʲelʲ|IPA}}) is a city in [[Belarus]]. It serves as the administrative centre of [[Gomel Region]] and [[Gomel District]], though it is administratively separated from the district.<ref name="pop" /> As of 2024, it is the [[List of cities and largest towns in Belarus|second-largest city]] in Belarus with 501,102 inhabitants.<ref name="pop" />

==Etymology==
There are at least six narratives of the origin of the city's name. The most plausible is that the name is derived from the name of the stream Homeyuk, which flowed into the [[Sozh river|river Sozh]] near the foot of the hill where the first settlement was founded. Names of other Belarusian cities are formed along these lines: for example, [[Polotsk]] from the river [[Palata (river)|Palata]], and [[Vitebsk]] from the river Vitsba.

The first appearance of the name, as "Gomy", dates from 1142.<ref name="EB Homyel">{{cite web |last1=Campbell |first1=Heather |title=Homyel Belarus |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Homyel-Belarus |website=www.britannica.com |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=8 May 2022 |language=en}}</ref> Up to the 16th century, the city was mentioned as Hom', Homye, Homiy, Homey, or Homyi. These forms are tentatively explained as derivatives of an unattested ''*gomŭ'' of uncertain meaning.<ref>''Этимологический словарь славянских языков: праславянский лексический фонд,'' под ред. О.Н. Трубачева, вып.7 (Москва, 1980), стр.21.</ref> The modern name for the city has been in use only since the 16th or 17th centuries.

==History==
===Kievan Rus'===
{{stack|[[File:Gomel inner fortress in the 12th century.jpg|thumb|190px| Gomel's inner fortress in the 12th century]]}}
Gomel was founded at the end of the 1st millennium AD on the lands of the [[East Slavs|Eastern Slavic]] tribal union of [[Radimichs]]. It lay on the banks of the [[Sozh|Sozh River]] and the [[Homeyuk]] stream. Sozh's high right bank, cut through by canyons, provided a natural fortification. For some time, Gomel was the capital of the Gomel Principality, before it became part of the [[Principality of Chernigov]]. Gomel is first mentioned in the [[Hypatian Codex]] under the year of 1142 as being territory of the princes of Chernigov. For some time, Gomel was ruled by the prince of Smolensk [[Rostislav Mstislavich]] before it was re-captured by [[Iziaslav III Davidovich]], after whose death it belonged to [[Sviatoslav Olgovich]] and then to Sviatoslav's son Oleg. Under Oleg, Gomel went to the [[Principality of Novgorod-Seversk]]. The next ruler was [[Igor Svyatoslavich]] – the hero of ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]''. During this period, the town was a fortified point and the centre of a [[volost]]. In the 12th–13th centuries, the city's area was not less than 40 ha, and it had developed various crafts and was connected by trading routes with the cities of northern and southern Rus'. Archeological data have shown that the city was badly damaged during the Mongol-Tatar assault in the first half of the 13th century.

===Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===
[[File:Gomel fortress in the 16th century.gif|thumb|230px| Gomel fortress in the 12th century. Art reconstruction]]
In 1335, the Gomel region was annexed to the [[Great Duchy of Lithuania]] by [[Algirdas]]. From 1335 to 1406, it was under the ownership of Prince Patricia Narymuntovich and his sons, from 1406 to 1419 the city was ruled by the grand duke's deputies, from 1419 to 1435 it belonged to Prince [[Svitrigaila]], from 1446 to 1452 to Prince Vasiliy Yaroslavich, from 1452 to 1483 to the [[Mozhaysk]] prince Ivan Andreyevich, and from 1483 to 1505 to his son Semyon, who transferred it to the [[Grand Principality of Moscow]].

During the [[Second Muscovite–Lithuanian War]] of 1500–1503, Lithuania tried to regain Gomel and other lands transferred to Moscow, but suffered defeat and lost one-third of its territory. In 1535, Lithuanian and Polish forces under [[Jerzy Radziwiłł|Jerzy Radvila]], [[Jan Tarnowski]] and Andrzej Niemirowicz re-captured the city after the surrender of Moscow's deputy, D. Shchepin-Obolensky. In the same year, the Great Duke of Lithuania [[Sigismund Kęstutaitis]] founded the Gomel [[Starostwo]]. According to the peace agreement of 1537, Gomel together with its [[volost]] remained a Lithuanian possession. In 1535–1565 Gomel is the centre of [[starostwo]], and from 1565 onwards Gomel is in the [[Rechytsa]] [[Powiat]] of the [[Minsk Voivodeship]].

[[File:Coat of Arms of Gomel, 1560.gif|thumb|right|100px| Coat of Arms of Gomel, 1560]]
In 1560, the city's first [[coat of arms]] was introduced. In 1569, Gomel became part of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. From this moment on, the city became the arena of numerous attacks and battles between [[Cossacks]], Russia and the [[Polish-Lithuania Commonwealth]]. In 1572, Gomel [[Starostwo]] was given to B. Sapega. At the beginning of the 1570s, Gomel was captured by the forces of [[Ivan the Terrible]], but in 1576 it was re-captured by J. Radvila. In 1581, Gomel was again attacked by Russian troops, and in 1595–1596 it was in the hands of [[Severyn Nalyvaiko]]'s Cossacks.

After the beginning of the struggle against [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] in Lithuania, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Nikolayevskiy Cathedral was closed on the order of [[Greek Catholic]] [[Eparch]] [[Josaphat Kuntsevych]] in 1621. In 1633 the city was besieged by the Cossacks of Bulgakov and Yermolin, in 1648 captured by the Golovatskiy's Cossack detachment, and in 1649 by Martyn Nebaba's detachment. After that, Gomel got through several sieges in 1651 but in 1654 was captured by Ivan Zolotarenko's detachment. He and his sons held the city until 1667 and then began to serve under [[Alexis of Russia]], however, after the [[Truce of Andrusovo]] Gomel at last returned to the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], where it first belonged to [[Mikołaj Krzysztof "the Orphan" Radziwiłł|M. K. Radvila]] and then – till the [[annexation]] by the [[Russian Empire]] – to the [[Czartoryski family]]. During the [[Great Northern War]] Russian forces under [[Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov]] stood in Gomel. In 1670, Gomel received [[Magdeburg rights]]. Towards the middle of the 17th century, the city fell into crisis mainly due to the struggles mentioned above. It suffered significant damage, the population decreased severely, and many crafts disappeared.

Gomel became part of the [[Russian Empire]] after the first partition of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1772 and was confiscated by the imperial treasury. In 1775, [[Catherine the Great|Empress Catherine II]] gave Gomel and Gomel eldership in the eternal hereditary possession of Russian military commander [[Pyotr Rumyantsev]].
[[File:Homiel. Гомель (1799).jpg|thumb|right|230px| Map of Gomel in 1799]]

The period when Gomel was part of the [[Russian Empire]] was marked by rapid growth of the population, urban infrastructure, and industrial capacity, predominantly after the construction of railways in the late 19th century.<ref>Экономика Белорусии в Эпоху Империализма 1900-1917. Под редакцией Г. Ковалевского и др. Минск 1963, стр.413</ref><ref>Л. Виноградов Гомель. Его Прошлое и настоящее. 1142-1900 г. Москва 1900, стр.35</ref>

The [[Peter and Paul Cathedral, Gomel|Peter and Paul Cathedral]], designed by architect John Clark, was built in 1809–1819. [[Nikolay Rumyantsev]] opened the first high school, hotel courtyard, glass, tile, distilleries, weaving and spinning factories, and he built a church, a synagogue, a pharmacy, a hospice and a permanent wooden bridge across the [[Sozh river]].

After the death of Nikolay Rumyantsev, the city came in possession of his brother Sergei Petrovich Rumyantsev. However, due to lack of money, Sergei indebted Gomel with the state treasury of the [[Russian Empire]]. Subsequently, after not being able to pay off the debt, the treasury sold the city. [[Gomel Palace]] was acquired by Prince [[Ivan Paskevich]], and the rest of the city by [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] (1838). Paskevich had an English garden made around the palace, which is still in place today. In 1856, the estate passed on to his son Fyodor Ivanovich Paskevich.

In 1852, Gomel became the county town of the former Belitsa county (renamed as Gomel county).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Без-Корнилович |first1=М.

Виноградов Гомель. Его Прошлое и настоящее. 1142-1900 г. Москва 1900, стр.34</ref> and the opening of a beet sugar factory.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Без-Корнилович |first1=М.

The construction of railways in the territory of Belarus in the late 19th century ([[Libau–Romny Railway]] in 1873 and Polesia railway in 1888) made Gomel a major railway junction and "attracted in the town many businessmen, caused the establishment of banks, firms and factories, which in turn changed the pastoral and provincial character of a bygone Gomel into a trading and mercantile one"<ref>Л. Виноградов Гомель. Его Прошлое и настоящее. 1142-1900 г. Москва 1900, стр.35</ref>

By 1913, Gomel was a major industrial city with 104,500 inhabitants. Nearly 44% of its industrial output was metalworking, with large workshops servicing the rolling stock of [[Libau–Romny Railway]] and Polesia railway. Other significant industries were timber processing, match manufacturing, breweries and churning.<ref>Экономика Белорусии в Эпоху Империализма 1900-1917. Под редакцией Г. Ковалевского и др. Минск 1963, стр.88</ref>

=== Civil war and early Soviet era ===
Preceding the [[treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], on 1 March 1918 the city was occupied (the Executive Committee of the Gomel Council of Workers' Deputies had left already on 21 February) by German forces.<ref name="153431/ Contraband"/> In March 1918, the city became part of [[Chernihiv Governorate]] of the [[Ukrainian State]].<ref name="153431/ Contraband">{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.istpravda.com.ua/articles/2018/12/19/153431/ Contraband, strikes, Bolsheviks ...

[[File:Districts and population of Homieĺ (Belarus).png|thumb|right|300px|Districts and population of the city]]
On 14 January 1919, Gomel was occupied by the Red Army. In March 1919, the largest uprising against the [[Bolshevik]]s occurred in Gomel, known as the short-lived Strekopytov Revolt. Rebels seized strategic facilities and executed members of the Soviet leadership in the city. The uprising was crushed by Red Army units dispatched to Gomel.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Golinkov|first1=D.

In 1919, Gomel became the centre of the [[Gomel Governorate]] in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]]. After the end of the hostilities, restoration of industry and transport began. In the 1920s, a number of large businesses had been created: shipyards, a factory named "Polespechat", a shoe factory named "Trud", a bakery, and the first phase of a municipal power plant. In 1926 the city was passed to the [[Byelorussian SSR]].

By 1940, 264 industrial enterprises had been established.

===World War II===
During [[World War II]], Gomel was under [[German occupation of Byelorussia during World War II|Nazi occupation]] from [[Operation Barbarossa|19 August 1941]] until [[Battle of the Dnieper|26 November 1943]]. The city was taken by [[Konstantin Rokossovsky|Rokossovsky]]'s [[1st Belorussian Front|Belorussian Front]] during the Gomel-Rechitsa Offensive. Eighty percent of the city was destroyed. The population of Gomel had dropped dramatically. According to the data of the registry, the population of Gomel numbered less than 15,000 inhabitants, compared to 144,000 in 1940.

=== Post-war period ===
After the war, restoration of Gomel began promptly. The majority of pre-revolutionary buildings were lost. City streets were considerably expanded, and buildings in [[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist style]] were erected. In 1950, almost all of the pre-war enterprises resumed their work.

===Chernobyl disaster===
As a result of the [[Chernobyl disaster|disaster]] at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] on 26 April 1986, Gomel suffered [[radioactive contamination]]. At the beginning of the 21st century, a scientific centre and practice for radiation medicine and human ecology was built in Gomel to overcome and study the consequences of the catastrophe at Chernobyl.<ref name="rcrm">{{cite web |title=The Republican Research Centre for Radiation Medicine and Human Ecology |url=http://rcrm.by/english/center_eng.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201114602/http://rcrm.by/english/center_eng.html|archive-date=1 February 2009}}</ref>

The development of radiological dose values varies between individual villages in severely contaminated regions, depending on the surroundings and the economic orientation. In general, life is possible in these areas today, even in formerly closed-off zones, if appropriate dietary rules are observed.{{explain|date=November 2023}}<ref>Petro Zoriy, Herbert Dederichs, Jürgen Pillath, Burkhard Heuel-Fabianek, Peter Hill, Reinhard Lennartz: [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Burkhard_Heuel-Fabianek/publication/311846655_Long-Term_Measurements_of_the_Radiation_Exposure_of_the_Inhabitants_of_Radioactively_Contaminated_Regions_of_Belarus_-_The_Korma_Report_II_1998_-_2015/links/585d2ecd08ae329d61f68de7.pdf ''Long-Term Measurements of the Radiation Exposure of the Inhabitants of Radioactively Contaminated Regions of Belarus – The Korma Report II (1998 – 2015)''] Verlag [[Forschungszentrum Jülich]] 2016, {{ISBN|978-3-95806-181-1}}.

=== Recent history ===
On 27 July 1990, the [[Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] was drafted. Gomel became a city in the independent state of the Republic of Belarus the following year.

During the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]], Gomel became an important base for Russian forces.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |year=2022 |title=Videos show Russian units and missiles advancing toward Ukraine border |url=https://www.axios.com/2022/02/11/satellite-images-russia-military-buildup-ukraine |access-date=2 July 2023 |website=Axios |publisher= |asin=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Knutson |first=Jacob |year=2022 |title=Satellite images show increased Russian military buildup near Ukraine |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/14/europe/russia-ukraine-troops-social-media-video-intl/index.html |access-date=2 July 2023 |website=[[CNN]] |publisher= |asin=}}</ref>

=== Jewish community ===

After the annexation of Gomel by the [[Russian Empire]] and the creation of the [[Pale of Settlement]], Gomel gradually became a centre of resettlement for the Jewish population of Russia. According to the 1897 census, 55% of the population of Gomel were [[Jews]]. In 1903, there was a violent [[pogrom]] against the Jewish population of the city.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13501674.2021.1952023|doi = 10.1080/13501674.2021.1952023|title = Science against Injustice: A Literary Investigation of Vladimir Bogoraz's Silhouettes from Gomel'|year = 2021|last1 = Berkovich|first1 = Nadja|journal = East European Jewish Affairs|volume = 51|pages = 1–17|s2cid = 238861156}}</ref> From that moment on, a gradual decrease of the number of Jews in the city began.  40,880 Jews lived in Gomel in 1939, when they comprised 29.4% of the total population. Most Jews had left the city in anticipation of German occupation, but still between 3,000 and 4,000 Gomel Jews fell victim to the [[Holocaust]].<ref name="YV">{{cite web |url=http://www.yadvashem.org/untoldstories/database/index.asp?cid=323 |publisher=Yad Vashem |title=The murder sites of the Jews in the occupied territories of the former USSR: Gomel |date=2017 |access-date=2017-01-07 |archive-date=8 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108094358/http://www.yadvashem.org/untoldstories/database/index.asp?cid=323 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s saw [[History of the Jews in Belarus#Late 20th century to modern days|mass emigration]] of Jews from Gomel, but at the same time restoration of Jewish institutions in the city by the remaining Jewish inhabitants.<ref name="JW">{{cite web|url=http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/homyel/gomel_history.html |publisher=Paul Zoglin |title=Gomel history |date=2009-12-16 |access-date=2017-01-07}}</ref>

==Geography==

Gomel is situated in the southeastern part of the country, on the right bank of the [[Sozh river|river Sozh]], {{convert|302|km|0|abbr=on}} south-east of [[Minsk]], {{convert|534|km|0|abbr=on}} east of [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]], {{convert|171|km|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Mogilev]], {{convert|237|km|0|abbr=on}} west of [[Bryansk]] and {{convert|111|km|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Chernihiv]].

The terrain on which the city as a whole is built, is flat. On the right bank of the river, it is a gradually decreasing plain water-glacial and [[fluvial terrace]] of the [[Sozh River|Sozh river]]. The left bank is a low-lying alluvial plain. The highest elevation of 144 meters above sea level is found at the northern outskirts of Gomel, the lowest elevation of 115 m at the water boundary Sozh river. Novobelitskiy district, which is located on the left bank of the river (i.e., towards the south), has elevations averaging of 10–15 meters lower than the northern and central parts of the city.

On the left bank of the Sozh many kilometers of beaches can be found.

===Climate===
Gomel has a warm-summer [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfb''). Warm summers and cold winters are caused by frequent arrival of warm sea air masses from the Atlantic and the dominating western transfer. On 7 August 2010, Gomel recorded a temperature of {{convert|38.9|C|F|abbr=on}}, which is the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Belarus.<ref name="wu">{{cite web|last=Masters|first=Jeff|title=Bolivia ties its all-time heat record|url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1701|work=Weather Underground|publisher=Dr. Jeff Masters' WunderBlog|access-date=23 November 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124020718/http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1701|archive-date=24 November 2010}}</ref>

==Transportation==
[[File:2010-built Gomel AKSM-321 trolleybus 1797 on route 1 in 2015.jpg|thumb|right|A [[trolleybus]] in the city centre in 2015]]
The public transportation system uses over 1,000 buses and [[trolleybus]]es. Over 210 million passenger rides were registered in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gorod.gomel.by/page.aspx?module=text&page_id=70&section_id=97 |title=Gomel Transportation Statistics (Russian language) |date=2007-12-13 |access-date=2014-01-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213171337/http://www.gorod.gomel.by/page.aspx?module=text&page_id=70&section_id=97 |archive-date=13 December 2007 }}</ref> [[Taxicab|Taxi]] services ($10 for a one-way intracity ride) are available 24 hours a day. The city is an important railroad hub in the southeastern part of Belarus, as it is situated midway on the [[Minsk]]–[[Kyiv]] rail link. The strategic location of Gomel near the border with Russia and Ukraine provides a direct connection to both countries’ vast railroad networks.

The trolleybus network opened on 20 May 1962<ref name="murray">{{cite book |last=Murray |first=Alan |title=World Trolleybus Encyclopaedia |year=2000 |page=74|publisher=Trolleybooks |location=Yateley, Hampshire, UK |isbn=0-904235-18-1}}</ref> and now consists of 23 routes (not counting variations). On 15 December 2010, following the construction of an [[overhead wire]] network in Egorenko, Sviridov, and Chechersk Streets, a new trackless trolley line opened to the terminus "Klinkowski Neighborhood," which resulted in a change of the trolleybus routes 9, 16, and 17. The length of the network is about {{convert|74|km|0|abbr=on}}, and the total length of the trolleybus routes is {{convert|475|km|0|abbr=on}}. The rolling stock comprises [[ACSM-201]], [[ACSM-321]], MAZ-203T, and ACSM-213 types.
There are more than 60 bus routes totaling {{convert|670|km|0|abbr=on}}, and a number of express routes. The rolling stock consists mainly of MAZ-105, MAZ-107, MAZ-103 buses, and to a lesser extent MAZ-203, MAZ-206, and since 2014, the extra-large-capacity, low-floor [[MAZ-215]]. Express routes use Rodemich-A type buses. The 24 minibus lines use Ford Transit, GAZelle, Mercedes-Benz, and Peugeot vans.

[[Gomel Airport]] is located {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} northeast of the city.

== Sports ==
[[File:Стадион "Центральный" (Гомель).JPG|thumb|[[Central Stadium (Gomel)|Central Stadium]]]]
Gomel is home to a wide range of sports facilities that have been developed and improved in recent years. These facilities, including eight stadiums and the Ice Palace, which has two ice arenas, support common activities such as hockey, track and field, and football. [[HK Gomel]] of the [[Belarusian Extraleague]] is the local pro hockey team.  The [[Central Stadium (Gomel)|Central Stadium]] is the home of Gomel's local football club, [[FC Gomel]]. Gomel hosts multiple international competitions in these facilities, the annual "Bells of Chernobyl" competition being one of the many.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gomel-region.by/en/sport-en/|title=Gomel Oblast Tourism and sport {{!}} Gomel region {{!}} Gomel|website=www.gomel-region.by|access-date=2016-11-12}}</ref> In addition to sports facilities, Gomel has a multitude of [[Olympic Reserve School]]s, which are more commonly referred to as sports schools.

Many of Gomel's sports schools prepare athletes from a young age. Numerous champions have been trained by schools such as these. For example, one school, Gomel's Olympic Reserve Number 4, has trained 97 World and European champions as well as two Olympic athletes. Gomel State College of Olympic Reserve, on the other hand, trains coaches rather than athletes. From this school, 44 graduates have participated in the Olympics, European championships, and World championships.<ref name=":1" /> Gomel also participates in the [[Deaflympics]] and, between the years 2007–2009, has been awarded: two gold medals, one silver medal, and two bronze medals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gomel.belstu.by/gomel_en.html|title=УО "Гомельский государственный политехнический колледж" - официальный Web-сайт|website=gomel.belstu.by|access-date=2016-11-12}}</ref>

==Education==
Since 1990, [[Francisk Skorina Gomel State University]], [[Pavel Sukhoi State Technical University of Gomel]], and [[Gomel State Medical University]] have attracted many international students from countries around the world, including the United States, Germany,{{needs update|date=October 2024}} China, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Syria, Russia, Ukraine, Egypt, Iran, and countries in Latin America.{{citation needed|date=October 2024}} Gomel State Medical University provides classes in both English and Russian. Many prominent scientists{{who|date=October 2024}} work here as senior lecturers.

==Culture==
Throughout the eight hundred-year history of Gomel, only a few sights have been preserved. A small part of them belong to the 1700s and 1800s, the main part belongs to the 20th - 21st centuries. Most of the architectural monuments of the 20th century date back to the 1950s. Most of them are concentrated in the central part of the city.

The Ferris Wheel and the Ferris Tower, located in a park a few hundred meters from the palace complex, are popular for exploring the city. Since the topography of Gomel is relatively flat, the height of the surrounding buildings means it is easy to view the city from the wheel and tower.
