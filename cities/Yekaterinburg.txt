Yekaterinburg was founded on 18 November 1723 and named after the Orthodox name of [[Catherine I of Russia|Catherine I]] (born Marta Helena Skowrońska), the wife of Russian Emperor [[Peter the Great]]. The city served as the mining capital of the [[Russian Empire]] as well as a strategic connection between Europe and Asia. In 1781, [[Catherine the Great]] gave Yekaterinburg the status of a district town of [[Perm Province]], and built the historical [[Siberian Route]] through the city.<ref name="town">{{Cite news |date=26 January 2013 |title=Журнал "Родина": ОКНО В АЗИЮ |work=archive.is |url=http://www.istrodina.com/rodina_articul.php3?id=2714&n=132 |url-status=dead |access-date=15 May 2018 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130126122110/http://www.istrodina.com/rodina_articul.php3?id=2714&n=132 |archive-date=26 January 2013}}</ref> Yekaterinburg became a key city to Siberia, which had rich resources. In the late 19th century, Yekaterinburg became one of the centres of revolutionary movements in the Urals. In 1924, after the [[Russian Soviet Socialist Federative Republic|Russian SFSR]] founded the [[Soviet Union]], the city was renamed ''Sverdlovsk'' after the [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Yakov Sverdlov]]. During the Soviet era, Sverdlovsk was turned into an industrial and administrative powerhouse. On 23 September 1991 the city returned to its historical name.

Yekaterinburg is one of Russia's most important economic centres and was one of the host cities of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]. The city is currently experiencing an economic and population boom, which resulted in some of the [[list of tallest buildings in Russia|tallest skyscrapers of Russia]] being located in the city. Yekaterinburg is home to the headquarters of the [[Central Military District]] of the [[Russian Armed Forces]], as well as the presidium of the Ural Branch of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].

=== Prehistory ===
[[File:Литейная форма.jpg|left|thumb|[[Bronze Age]] 5-[[sickle]] [[casting]] mold, [[Sverdlovsk Regional Museum of Local Lore]]]]
The area was settled in prehistory. The earliest settlements date to 8000–7000&nbsp;BC, in the [[Mesolithic|Mesolithic period]]. The Isetskoe Pravoberezhnoye I archaeological site contains a [[Neolithic]] settlement dated to 6000–5000&nbsp;BC. It includes stone processing workshops with artefacts such as grinding plates, anvils, clumps of rock, tools, and finished products. Over 50 different types of rock and minerals were used in tool making, indicating extensive knowledge of the region's natural resources. The Gamayun peninsula (left bank of the Verkh-Isetsky Pond) has archaeological findings from the [[Chalcolithic|Chalcolithic Period]]: workshops for producing stone tools (upper area) and two dwellings of the Ayat culture (lower area). There are also traces of the Koptyak culture from 2000&nbsp;BC: dishes decorated with bird images and evidence of metallurgical production. The Tent I site contains the only Koptyak culture burials discovered in the [[Ural Mountains]]. In the [[Bronze Age]], the people of Gamayun culture lived in the area. They left fragments of ceramics, weapons, and ornaments.<ref>{{cite web |title=Памятникик археологии |url=http://www.1723.ru/read/map-okr/ekaterinburg-1994.htm |access-date=20 May 2018 |website=1723.ru}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{cite web |title=1.2.

Archaeological artifacts in the vicinity of Yekaterinburg were first discovered during railway construction, at the end of the 19th century. Excavation and research began in the 20th century. Artifacts are held at the [[Sverdlovsk Regional Museum of Local Lore]], at the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], at the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography of the Academy of Sciences, and at other museums.<ref name=":2" />

{{Further|Russian Empire}}[[File:Uktus plant.jpg|left|thumb|Uktus plant, 1720]]The first Russian settlements within the boundaries of modern Yekaterinburg appeared in the second half of the 17th century — in 1672, an [[Old Believers]] village arose in the area of Shartash lake<ref name="gr" /> (this fact is disputed by historians, since no evidence of the founding of the village at that time was found in the sources),<ref>{{Cite web |last=Юрий |first=Коновалов |date= 26 March 2004 |title=Первые русские поселения на реке Уктус |url=https://www.okorneva.ru/publikatsii--konovalova-yuriya-vitalevicha/pervyie-russkie-poseleniya-na-reke-uktus/ |access-date=2024-06-07 |website=www.okorneva.ru |language=Russian}}</ref> and in 1680&ndash;1682, the villages of Nizhny and Verkhny Uktus appeared on the banks of Uktus River (now the territory of the Chkalovsky district of the city).<ref name=":19">{{Cite journal |last=Кулешов |first=Николай |date=2001 |title=Горных заводов щит |url=http://www.1723.ru/read/dai/dai-48.htm |journal=Домострой |issue=4}}</ref> In 1702, by the initiative of the head of [[Sibirskiy prikaz]] [[Andrew Vinius]], the Uktus state ironwork plant was founded near Nizhny Uktus — the first ironworks within the boundaries of modern Yekaterinburg.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Архипова |first=Нина |date=2001 |title=Тайны "превысочайшего Камня" |journal=[[Rodina (magazine)|Родина]] |issue=11}}</ref> In 1704, the Shuvakish ironworks was built (now the territory of the Zheleznodorozhny district of the city).<ref name="gr" /> With the beginning of active [[History of metallurgy in the Urals|construction of factories in the Urals]] in the 18th century, relations with their southern neighbors, the [[Bashkirs]], became strained. As a result of the Bashkir raid in 1709, the village of Verkhny Uktus was devastated, all buildings, including the wooden church and chapel, were burned, the residents fled to the protection of the Uktus plant fortifications.<ref name=":19" /> On the night of 5 April 1718, a fire destroyed all the factory buildings of the Uktus plant, except for the dam, and the plant was restored only by 1720 under the supervision of Timofey Burtsev.<ref>Корепанов Н.

In 1720, by decree of [[Peter the Great|Peter I]], a delegation led by mining specialist Johann Blüher and statesman [[Vasily Tatishchev]] was sent to the [[Ural (region)|Urals]].<ref name=":20">{{Cite book |last=Юхт |first=Александр |title=Государственная деятельность В.

As a result of familiarizing himself with the state of nearby state-owned factories, Tatishchev came to the conclusion that on the basis of these factories, even if they were reconstructed and expanded, it would not be possible to quickly increase the production of iron, and it would be more profitable to build a new large plant. After inspecting the immediate area, together with the commissary of the Uktus plant, Timofey Burtsev, a place rich in ore and forest was chosen on the banks of the more full-flowing [[Iset (river)|Iset River]], 7 [[verst]]s from Uktus.<ref name=":20" /> On 6 February 1721, Tatishchev sent a message to the [[Collegium of Mining]], in which he asked permission to begin construction of the plant, with detailed explanations and justification for this project.<ref name=":20" /> On 1 March 1721, without waiting for a response from the Collegium, Tatishchev began construction of the new plant,<ref name="gr" /> but he failed to convince Collegium, and by the Collegium decree of 10 December 1721, he was removed from the leadership of mining affairs in the Urals.<ref name="gr" /> In 1722, by decree of Peter the Great, a mining engineer, Major General [[Georg Wilhelm de Gennin]], was sent to the Urals in place of Tatishchev. Having studied all the circumstances, de Gennin fully supported Tatishchev’s project, and on 12 March 1723, construction of the plant on Iset resumed.<ref name="gr" />

[[Dmitry Mamin-Sibiryak]] very vividly described the beginning of the construction of a mining plant and a fortress: "Imagine completely deserted banks of the Iset river, covered with forest. In the spring of 1723, soldiers from Tobolsk, peasants of the assigned settlements, hired craftsmen appeared, and everything around came to life, as if by the dictates of a fairy tale.

[[File:PlanYekaterinburg1743.JPG|thumb|Plan of Yekaterinburg, 1743]]Yekaterinburg was one of the industrial cities of Russia prompted at the beginning of the 18th century by decrees of [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsar]] Peter the Great which demanded the development of the metalworking industry. With extensive use of iron, the city was built to a regular square plan with ironworks and residential buildings at the centre. These were surrounded by fortified walls so that Yekaterinburg was at the same time both a manufacturing centre and a fortress at the frontier between Europe and Asia. It, therefore, found itself at the heart of Russia's strategy for further development of the entire Ural region. The so-called [[Siberian Route]] became operational in 1763 and placed the city on an increasingly important transit route, which led to its development as a focus of trade and commerce between east and west, and gave rise to the description of the city as the "window to Asia". With the growth in trade and the city's administrative importance, the ironworks became less critical, and the more important buildings were increasingly built using expensive stone. Small manufacturing and trading businesses proliferated. In 1781 Russia's empress, Catherine the Great, granted Yekaterinburg town status and nominated it as the administrative centre for the wider region within [[Perm Governorate]].<ref name="town" /> In 1807, the role of the capital of the mining and smelting region was confirmed by assigning it the status of the only "mountain city" in Russia. Until 1863, Yekaterinburg remained subordinate to the head of the mining plants of the [[Ural Mountains|Ural ridge]], the minister of finance and personally to the emperor, and enjoyed considerable freedom from the governor's power. Since the 1830s, mountainous Yekaterinburg has become the center of mechanical engineering.<ref name="histrf1"/>

Following the [[October Revolution]], the family of deposed [[Tsar Nicholas II]] was sent to internal exile in Yekaterinburg where they were imprisoned in the [[Ipatiev House]] in the city. In July 1918, the [[Czechoslovak Legion]]s were closing on Yekaterinburg.

===Soviet era===
[[File:Ekaterinbourg.jpeg|thumb|Snow-covered statue of [[Yakov Sverdlov]]|alt=]]
In the years following the [[Russian Revolution]] and the [[Russian Civil War]], political authority of the Urals was transferred from [[Perm, Russia|Perm]] to Yekaterinburg. On 19 October 1920, Yekaterinburg established its first university, the [[Ural State University]], as well as polytechnic, pedagogical, and medical institutions under the decree of Soviet leader [[Vladimir Lenin]]. Enterprises in the city ravaged by the war were nationalised, including: the Metalist (formerly Yates) Plant, the Verkh-Isetsky (formerly Yakovleva) Plant, and the Lenin flax-spinning factory (formerly Makarov). In 1924, the city of Yekaterinburg was renamed Sverdlovsk after the Bolshevik leader [[Yakov Sverdlov]].<ref>{{cite web |script-title=ru:Главная: НОВОСТИ |url=http://www.familii.ru/index.php?pCode=news&news=1014 |access-date=20 May 2018 |website=familii.ru |language=ru-ru}}</ref><ref name="gr">{{cite web |title=Екатеринбург |url=http://gerb.duma.midural.ru/ter/ter33 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308011816/http://gerb.duma.midural.ru/ter/ter33 |archive-date=8 March 2013 |access-date=6 December 2009 |website=Геральдика Свердловской области |publisher=Официальный сайт областной думы законодательного собрания |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=":3" />

By the 1934, following a series of administrative reforms carried by the early Soviet government, the earliest Russian settlements which predated Yekaterinburg and laid the basis of its founding, were incorporated into the city proper.<ref name=":22" /><ref name="spr">{{cite web |title=Справочник по административно-территориальному делению Свердловской области |url=http://uralarchives.ru/docs/archives/ga/gaso-ter.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222054335/http://uralarchives.ru/docs/archives/ga/gaso-ter.pdf |archivedate=2017-02-22 |accessdate=2013-02-02 |publisher=ГАСО (State Archive of the Sverdlovsk oblast) |pages=37}}</ref>

During the reign of Stalin, Sverdlovsk was one of several places developed by the Soviet government as a centre of heavy industry. Old factories were reconstructed and new large factories were built, especially those specialised in machine-building and metalworking. These plants included [[Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works|Magnitogorsk]] and the [[Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant]] in [[Chelyabinsk oblast]], and [[Uralmash]] in Sverdlovsk. During this time, the population of Sverdlovsk tripled in size, and it became one of the fastest-growing cities of the Soviet Union. At that time, very large powers were given to the regional authorities. By the end of the 1930s, there were 140 industrial enterprises, 25 research institutes, and 12 higher education institutions in Sverdlovsk.<ref name="Rappaport1999">{{Cite book |first=Helen |last=Rappaport |author-link=Helen Rappaport |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lsKClpnX8qwC |title=Joseph Stalin: A Biographical Companion |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=1999 |isbn=978-1-57607-084-0}}</ref><ref name="sp">{{cite web |last=Беркович Артём |title=Пермь и Екатеринбург: история соперничества |url=http://m-i-e.ru/library/istoriya/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525123845/http://m-i-e.ru/library/istoriya/ |archive-date=25 May 2013 |access-date=16 December 2009 |publisher=Муниципальный музей истории Екатеринбурга |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

During World War II, the city became the headquarters of the [[Volga–Urals Military District|Ural Military District]] on the basis of which more than 500 different military units and formations were formed, including the [[22nd Army (Russia)|22nd Army]] and the Ural Volunteer Tank Corps. Uralmash became the main production site for armoured vehicles. Many state technical institutions and whole factories were relocated to Sverdlovsk away from cities affected by war (mostly Moscow), with many of them staying in Sverdlovsk after the victory. The [[Hermitage Museum]] collections were also partly evacuated from [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] to Sverdlovsk in July 1941 and remained there until October 1945.<ref>{{citation |mode=cs1 |date=2005 |title=In the name of Victory.

===Contemporary era===
During the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|1991 coup d'état attempt]], Sverdlovsk, the home city of President Boris Yeltsin, was selected by him as a temporary reserve capital for the Russian Federation, in case Moscow became too dangerous for the Russian government.

In the 2000s, an intensive growth of trade, business, and tourism began in Yekaterinburg. In 2003, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] and German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] negotiated in Yekaterinburg. On 15–17 June 2009, the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation|SCO]] and [[BRIC]] summits were held in Yekaterinburg, which greatly improved the economic, cultural, and tourist situation in the city. On 13–16 July 2010, a meeting between Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] and German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] took place in the city.<ref>{{cite web |last=(www.dw.com) |first=Deutsche Welle |title=First BRIC summit concludes {{!}} DW {{!}} 16 June 2009 |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4335954,00.html |access-date=20 May 2018 |website=DW.COM |language=en}}</ref>

==Geography==
===Location===
[[File:Yekaterinburg City (Russia) and vicinities, satellite image 2017-07-12.jpg|thumb|250px|Yekaterinburg City and vicinities, satellite image of ESA [[Sentinel-2]]]]
Geographically, Yekaterinburg is in North Asia, close to the [[Ural Mountains]] (which divide Europe from Asia), {{cvt|1667|km}} east of the nation's capital Moscow.

The city has a total area of {{cvt|1111|km2}}.

Yekaterinburg is on the eastern side of the Urals. The city is surrounded by wooded hills, partially cultivated for agricultural purposes. Yekaterinburg is located on a natural watershed, so there would be many bodies of water close and in the city. The city is bisected by the [[Iset River]], which flows from the Urals into the [[Tobol River]]. There are two lakes in the city, Lake Shuvakish and Lake Shartash. The city borders Verkh-Isetskiy Pond, through which the Iset River flows. Lake Isetskoye and Lake Baltym are both near the city, with Lake Isetskoye located near [[Sredneuralsk]], and Lake Baltym located near the towns of Sanatornyy and Baltym.

===Time===
Yekaterinburg uses the Yekaterinburg Time, which is five hours ahead of UTC (UTC+5), and two hours ahead of [[Moscow Time]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=22 July 2014 |title=Russia moves to year-round winter time |language=en |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-28423647 |access-date=20 May 2018}}</ref>

===Climate===
The city possesses a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfb'') under the [[Köppen climate classification]].<ref name="climat">{{Cite journal |last1=Грязнов Олег Николаевич |last2=Гуляев Александр Николаевич |last3=Рубан Наталья Валентиновна |date=2015 |title=Факторы инженерно-геологических условий города Екатеринбурга |url=http://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/faktory-inzhenerno-geologicheskih-usloviy-goroda-ekaterinburga |journal=Izvestiia Uralʹskogo Gorno-Geologicheskoĭ Akademii |type=журнал |edition=Известия Уральского государственного горного университета |location=Екатеринбург |publisher=Федеральное государственное бюджетное образовательное учреждение высшего образования "Уральский государственный горный университет" |pages=5–21 |issn=2307-2091 |number=3}}</ref> It is characterised by sharp variability in weather conditions, with well-marked seasons. The Ural Mountains, despite their insignificant height, block air from the west, from the European part of Russia. As a result, the Central Urals are open to the invasion of cold arctic air and continental air from the West Siberian Plain. Equally, warm air masses from the Caspian Sea and the deserts of Central Asia can freely penetrate from the south. Therefore, the weather in Yekaterinburg is characterised by sharp temperature fluctuations and weather anomalies: in winter, from frost at −40&nbsp;°C to thaw and rain; in summer, from frosts to temperatures above {{cvt|35|°C}}.<ref name="climat" />

</gallery>

The distribution of precipitation is determined by the circulation of air masses, relief, and air temperatures. The main part of the precipitation is brought by cyclones with a western air mass transfer, that is, from the European part of Russia, while their average annual amount is 601&nbsp;mm. The maximum falls on a warm season, during which about 60–70% of the annual amount falls. For the winter period is characterized by snow cover with an average capacity of 40–50&nbsp;cm. The coefficient of moistening(the ratio of yearly precipitation and [[potential evaporation]]) – 1.<ref name="climat" />
* The average temperature in January is {{cvt|-12.6|°C}}. The record minimum temperature is {{cvt|-44.6|°C}} (6 January 1915);
* The average July temperature is {{cvt|18.9|°C}}. The record maximum temperature is {{cvt|40.0|°C}} (11 July 2023);
* The average annual temperature is {{cvt|2.1|°C}};
* The average annual wind speed is {{cvt|2.9|m/s|km/h mph}};
* The average annual humidity is 75%;
* The average annual precipitation is {{cvt|534|mm}};

[[Christianity]] is the predominant religion in the city, of which most are adherents to the Russian Orthodox Church. The Yekaterinburg and Verkhotursky diocese is located in the [[Trinity Cathedral (Yekaterinburg)|Holy Trinity Cathedral]] in the city. Other religions practised in Yekaterinburg include [[Islam]], [[Old Believers]], [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]], and [[Judaism]].

Yekaterinburg has a significant Muslim community, but it suffers from a lack of worship space: there are only two small [[mosque]]s. Another mosque was built in the nearby city of [[Verkhnyaya Pyshma]]. On 24 November 2007, the first stone was laid in the construction of a large [[Jama Masjid|Cathedral Mosque]] with four [[minaret]]s, and space for 2,500 parishioners in the immediate vicinity of the cathedral and a [[synagogue]], thus forming the "area of the three religions".<ref>{{cite web |title=В Екатеринбурге заложили первый камень в основание соборной мечети – Уральская палата недвижимости |url=http://upn.ru/index.aspx?page=news&categoryId=0&year=2007&month=11&day=0&id=7857&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 |access-date=5 October 2017 |website=upn.ru |archive-date=10 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010150812/http://upn.ru/index.aspx?page=news&categoryId=0&year=2007&month=11&day=0&id=7857&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The mosque was planned to be built for the SCO summit, but due to funding problems, construction did not move from zero and is now frozen.

Most of the city's religious buildings were [[USSR anti-religious campaign (1921–1928)|destroyed]] during the Soviet era, in addition to the synagogue, the three largest Orthodox churches in Yekaterinburg were demolished – the Epiphany Cathedral, the Ekaterininsky Cathedral, and the [[Great Zlatoust Church]]. Other Christian churches such as the Lutheran Church of Yekaterinburg and the Roman Catholic Church of St. Anne (a new Catholic [[St. Anne's Church, Yekaterinburg|St. Anne's Church]] was built in 2000) were demolished as well. Other churches were used as warehouses and industrial sites. The only religious building in Yekaterinburg in the Soviet era was the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist. Recently, some churches are being rebuilt. Since 2006, according to the surviving drawings, the Great Zlatoust Church was restored in 2012. On 17 April 2010, the city was visited by [[Patriarch Kirill of Moscow|Patriarch Kirill]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Встреча Святейшего Патриарха Кирилла с общественностью Уральского федерального округа / Видеоматериалы / Патриархия.ru |url=http://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/1141514.html |access-date=18 October 2017 |website=Патриархия.ru |language=ru}}</ref>

Studies have shown that as early as 2005, the capacity limit for the road network was reached, which has now led to permanent congestion.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Цариков А.А. |last2=Обухова Н.А. |last3=Оглы Мирзоев Н.З. |date=2015 |title=Эволюция системы заторов на улично-дорожной сети города Екатеринбурга |url=https://www.usurt.ru/uploads/main/01r/56ab448ae80d7/14.pdf |type=журнал |edition=Эксплуатация автомобильного транспорта |location=Екатеринбург |publisher=Общероссийская общественная организация "Российская академия транспорта" |pages=74–86 |issn=2311-164X |number=4 |access-date=8 October 2017 |archive-date=12 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712102502/http://www.usurt.ru/uploads/main/01r/56ab448ae80d7/14.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>
To increase the capacity of the street-road network, stage-by-stage reconstruction of streets is being carried out, as well as multi-level interchanges being built. In order to reduce the transit traffic, the Sverdlovsk Oblast administration announced two road projects in 2014: the Yekaterinburg Ring Road (EKAD) and an overpass road on Sovetskaya Street. The Yekaterinburg Ring Road would surround the largest municipalities of Yekaterinburg. Its purpose would be to help the city's economy and reduce traffic on the Middle Ring Road of the city, making it easier for civilians to commute around the city than going through the city's traffic congestion. Eventually, the Ring Road would connect to other federal roads in order for easier access between other Russian cities. Construction of the road started in the same year. The projects were assigned to the Ministry of Transport and Communications since the projects were crucial to the city's economy. Officials hope the road projects will build environments more conducive to improving local quality of life and outside investments. Completing these major inter-regional roads will increase productive traffic by 50% to 100%, improving the local economy with its ease of access to industries.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Reports |first=Yekaterinburg News |title=Sverdlovsk focusing on two road projects |language=en |url=http://yekaterinburgnews.com/stories/510450200-sverdlovsk-focusing-on-two-road-projects |url-status=dead |access-date=14 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006112158/http://yekaterinburgnews.com/stories/510450200-sverdlovsk-focusing-on-two-road-projects |archive-date=6 October 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

A television studio was built in Yekaterinburg (as Sverdlovsk) in 1955 and on 6 November of the same year, the first telecast appeared.

=== Architecture ===
[[File:Усадьба Расторгуева-Харитонова Екатеринбург.JPG|thumb|The [[Rastorguyev-Kharitonov Palace]], built from 1794 to 1820|left]]Many buildings of Yekaterinburg are ranged from a different number of architectural styles. The city had a regular layout, based on the fortresses of the Renaissance and by the principles of French town planning during the 17th century. By the 18th century, the Baroque movement was not that influential in Yekaterinburg, with the style being seen in churches which later declined<ref name=":12">{{Cite book |date=2002 |title=Yekaterinburg Encyclopedia |url=http://ihist.uran.ru/files/2002_Yekaterinburg.pdf |publisher=Yekaterinburg: "Akademkniga" |page=30 |isbn=5-93472-068-6 |via=PDF}}</ref>

In the first half of the 19th century, [[Neoclassical architecture in Russia|neoclassicism]] grew influential in the Yekaterinburg's architecture. The estates were built in the neoclassic style, including the main house, wings, services, and often an English-style park. This style's influence in Yekaterinburg is mostly due to the contributions of architect Michael Malakhov, who worked in the city from 1815 to 1842. He designed the assemblies of the Verkhne-Isetsky factory as well as the Novo-Tikhvinsky Monastery.<ref name=":12" />

At the beginning of the 20th century, [[eclecticism]] became a dominant influence in Yekaterinburg's architecture. Buildings such as the Opera House and [[Yekaterinburg railway station]] were built in this style. During the 1920s and the 1930s, [[Constructivist architecture|constructivism]] took effect, influencing residential complexes, industrial buildings, stadiums, etc. Architects Moses Ginzburg, Jacob Kornfeld, the Vesnina brothers, Daniel Friedman, and Sigismund Dombrovsky contributed greatly to the constructivism in the city. More than 140 structures in Yekaterinburg are designed through the constructivist style.<ref>{{Cite book |date=2002 |title=Yekaterinburg Encyclopedia |url=http://ihist.uran.ru/files/2002_Yekaterinburg.pdf |publisher=Yekaterinburg: "Akademkniga" |pages=30–31 |isbn=5-93472-068-6 |via=PDF}}</ref>
[[File:Музей ПурВО.jpg|thumb|District Officers' House]]
During the 1930s to 1950s, there was a turn back to neoclassicism, with much attention paid to public buildings and monuments. Notable examples include the buildings of the Ural Industrial Institute on Lenin Avenue, the City Party Committee and the City Council Executive Committee building (now the City Administrative building), the District Officers' House, and the House of Defense complex. Cultural buildings are built in the squares in orderly composition. In these years, architects Golubev, K. T. Babykin, Valenkov worked fruitfully in Yekaterinburg with this style. In the 1960s, changes in the approach to construction led to widespread distribution of apartment blocks common in the [[History of the Soviet Union (1953–64)|Khrushchev era]]. Buildings built by individuals were rare, among them being: KKT "Kosmos", the Palace of Youth, and DK UZTM.<ref>{{Cite book |date=2002 |title=Yekaterinburg Encyclopedia |url=http://ihist.uran.ru/files/2002_Yekaterinburg.pdf |publisher=Yekaterinburg: "Akademkniga" |page=31 |isbn=5-93472-068-6 |via=PDF}}</ref>

From the 1960s to the 1980s, as industrial development grew in Yekaterinburg, so did [[Rationalism (architecture)|rationalism]]. The situation changed in the 1990s when Russia transferred into a market economy. At that time, older buildings were restored, giving the urban area a new environment such as: the Cosmos Concert Hall, the Puppet Theater, the children's ballet theatre The Nutcracker, the Palace of Justice, the Cathedral of the Blood, and the [[Church of the Transfiguration, Yekaterinburg|Church of the Transfiguration]]. At the same time, the construction of new buildings was accompanied by the demolition of historical buildings, leading to the development of the "facade" phenomenon, where the facades of historic buildings are preserved while adjacent modern buildings are built.<ref name=":13">{{Cite journal |last=Shvets |first=A.

The centre of Yekaterinburg became the centre of new construction, where banks, business centres, hotels, luxury residential complexes, and sports and shopping centres were built. [[High-tech architecture]] grew influential, with buildings such as the Center for Railway Transportation Management, the Summit business centre, the Aquamarine residential complex, and the retail strip at Vaynera Street being notable examples. Along with this, [[Postmodern architecture|postmodernism]] revived interest in the older architectural styles of Yekaterinburg, growing more emphasis on historicalism and contextualism. In the late 1990s, architects grew interested in [[Regionalism (art)|regionalism]].<ref name=":13" />

At the beginning of the 21st century, Yekaterinburg architects turned back to the Soviet-based avant-garde, and influence future city buildings with the [[Neoconstructivism (art)|neoconstructivist]] style. The practice of attracting large foreign investors to projects has become popular. In 2007, the construction of the Central business district started, being headed by the French architect Jean Pistre.<ref name=":13" /> In 2010, Yekaterinburg became one of the largest centers for the construction of High-rise buildings. In the city, 1,189 high-rise buildings were built, including 20 skyscrapers, the tallest of which is the [[Iset Tower]], with a height of 209 meters.<ref>{{cite web |last=GmbH |first=Emporis |title=Yekaterinburg {{!}} Buildings {{!}} EMPORIS |url=https://www.emporis.com/city/100842/yekaterinburg-russia |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408012756/http://www.emporis.com/city/100842/yekaterinburg-russia |url-status=usurped |archive-date=8 April 2015 |access-date=8 June 2018 |website=[[Emporis]]}}</ref>

The matches were played on the upgraded [[Central Stadium (Yekaterinburg)|Yekaterinburg Arena]].<ref name=":9" />

For the World Cup 2018, from 7 October 2015 to 29 December 2017, the Central Stadium was upgraded to bring it into compliance with FIFA requirements for the World Cup and was renamed Yekaterinburg Arena.

During the reconstruction of the sports facility, which is a monument of history and culture, the facades are carefully preserved, and the arena itself is equipped with the latest technical achievements of the sports industry. Temporary stands extending outside the stadium's original perimeter were erected to comply with the FIFA requirement of seating for 35,000 spectators. They can hold a total of 12,000 spectators, but the seating will be removed after the World Cup, decreasing the seating capacity back to 23,000.<ref>{{cite web |last=sport |first=Guardian |date=4 October 2017 |title=Outer space: the Russia World Cup stadium with a novel seating extension |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/04/russia-world-cup-stadium-ekaterinburg-arena-seating-built-outside-venue-fifa |access-date=23 May 2018 |website=the Guardian |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Construction: Tsentralnyj Stadion Yekaterinburg – StadiumDB.com |url=http://stadiumdb.com/constructions/rus/tsentralnyi_stadion_ekaterinburg |access-date=23 May 2018 |website=stadiumdb.com |language=en}}</ref>
