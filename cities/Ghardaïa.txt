The [[M'zab]] in the Ghardaïa Province was made a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1982, as a cultural property evaluated under the criteria II (for its settlement affecting urban planning even to the present century), III (for its [[Ibadi]] cultural values), and V (a settlement culture which has prevailed to the present century).<ref name=Unesco>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/188|title=M'Zab Valley|access-date=12 November 2010|publisher=Unesco.org}}</ref><ref name=Valley>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/188.pdf|title=The Mazab valley: Evaluation Report|access-date=12 November 2010|publisher=Unesco.org}}</ref>

Ghardaïa is part of a [[pentapolis]], a hilltop city amongst four others, built almost a thousand years ago in the M’Zab valley.

==Etymology==
The name of Ghardaïa has its origins in a female saint named [[Daïa]] who lived in a cave (ghār) in the area before it blossomed into a town inhabited by Ibadi Muslims who came to escape persecution from the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] in the north.<ref name="Harris">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XFp0mcwO_9YC&pg=PA33|author=Harris, Nathanuel|title=Atlas of the world's deserts|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=33|isbn=1-57958-310-5|year=2003}}</ref><ref name="Britannica">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/232469/Ghardaia|title=Ghardaia|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|access-date=November 11, 2010}}</ref>

==History==
The M'Zab valley, in [[limestone]] [[plateau]], was inscribed under the UNESCO Heritage List, is a unique conglomeration of five cities confined in area of 75&nbsp;km² situated 600&nbsp;km to the south of [[Algiers]], the capital of Algeria.

The original architecture of the semi desert valley is dated to early 11th century. It is ascribed to the [[Ibadi]]s, with their cultural identity originally traced to the [[Maghreb]]; they had their capital at Tahert as an Ibadi Kingdom. They were forced to leave Tahert consequent to a devastating fire in 909 (it is reported that destruction was caused by the founder of the (Shi'ite) [[Fatimid Dynasty]]<ref name=world/>). They first moved to Sedrata and finally to the M'Zab valley. They settled in five fortified villages located on rocky outcrops, known locally as “Kosars”, although they could have lived in one larger village encompassing all the five. The habitation was planned with meticulous details to precise layouts defined by set principles of community living within a defensive environment. Ghardaïa's foundation has been dated to 1048<ref>http://www.opvm.dz/public/opvm/catalogue/index/id/dc673ccd14b3f39992e5e70652d70fef Office de protection et de promotion de la vallée du M'Zab</ref> or 1053.<ref>http://www.monographie.caci.dz/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=77 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303173742/http://www.monographie.caci.dz/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=77 |date=2016-03-03 }} Chambre algérienne de commerce et d'industrie</ref>

Each village was planned in a diverse topography comprising a small island, a ridge, a hilltop, a peak and a recess. The villages were fortified in such a manner that they were inaccessible to the nomadic groups. The five villages set up with identical planning concepts were Ghardaïa, Melika, Beni Isguen, Bou Noura and El Atteuf. The identical “miniature citadels”, as they are termed, each had their own mosque with minaret functioning as watch towers, and the houses built around the mosque in concentric circles and surrounded by a high walls (extending up to the ramparts). The buildings together gave the feel of a fortress to each village. The mosque also provided for storage of grains and arms for defence.<ref name=Unesco/><ref name=Valley/><ref name=world/>

However, during the summer season the inhabitants migrated to a "citadel" outside the fortified villages, in an informal setting of artificial palm grove, a [[cemetery]] and a mosque.<ref name=world/>

The ksar was created in 476/1085 by two tribes : the Aoulad Ammi-Aïssa and the Aoulad Ba-Slimane. Each tribe contained different fractions, a specific area and a cemetery'''<ref name=":0" />'''. Ghardaïa is the richest city of the M'Zab Vallée. It already had a dynamic commercial and craft activity. On the social aspect, it is the only Ksar, along with Melika, that housed not only Ibadites Berbers, but also Malekits Arabs and a Jewish community until the Algerian Independence.

To build the Ksar, the founders of Ghardaïa, a small group of people, under a Cheikh, chose a hill 200m south of the M'Zab Oued for defensive purposes. Farther west, they created a palm grove for subsistence farming. The Ksar of Ghardaïa, as it is today, did not appear in one time. According to the public agency in charge of protecting the M'Zab Heritage, Ghardaïa has seen four phases of evolution until 1882, when it was annexed by the French army.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.secheresse.info/spip.php?article91042|title=Évolution du tracé urbain des ksour de la vallée du M'Zab : d'el-Ateuf à Tafilelt, sauvegarde d'un patrimoine millénaire|last=Ali Khodja|first=Mehdi|date=15 July 2019|website=secheresse.info/|access-date=10 April 2020|archive-date=4 June 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230604122645/http://www.secheresse.info/spip.php?article91042|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Ghardaïa commune map.png|thumb|upright=1.40|Map of major settlements within the province of Ghardaïa]]
The city is located within the [[Sahara Desert]] in northern-central Algeria. [[Ghardaïa Province]] is divided into 13 [[communes of Algeria|''communes'']] or municipalities, which includes the Ghardaïa municipality. It is bordered by Ouargla and El Bayadh Wilayas. It is nestled in the [[M'zab]] valley, lying on the left bank of the [[Wadi Mzab]], which is commonly dry throughout the year. The commune of Ghardaïa now covers an area of {{convert|590|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and includes a number of suburbs, towns and villages in addition to Ghardaïa. Suburb settlements include [[Mélika]], [[Béni Isguen]], [[Bounoura]] (Has Bunur) and [[El Atteuf]] (Tadjnint), all of which lie to the southeast of Ghardaïa city and the ancient [[ksar]] of [[Metlili|Metlili-Chaamba]] or Metlili which lies {{convert|42|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the southwest.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Outside of the Mzab valley, [[Berriane]] (Has Ibergane) and [[El Guerrara]] (Iguerraren) are towns of note, the first {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the north, and the second {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the northeast.

===Hydrology===
Ghardaïa's ancient water distribution system was devised by the Mozabites, as a response to the ephemeral flows of its oueds (rivers). Realising the preciousness of this natural resource, the Mozabites developed a unique hydraulic system of tunnels to harvest rainwater and divert it to the oases. They have an equitable water distribution to all gardens and also maintain good flood protection measures.<ref name="Ham & Luckham & Sattin"/><ref name="Mozambite"/> The water supply is accessed in a number of ways through a complex irrigation system that distributes water from many wells.<ref name="Tilouine"/> Well drilling extends to a depth ranging from {{convert|350|ft|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}}, drawing the water from the [[Albian]] fossil groundwater continental infill whose reserves are estimated at 1.5 trillion m<sup>3</sup>.

===Climate===
Ghardaïa has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh''), with extremely hot summers and mild winters. The region is marked by large temperature differences between day and night, and summer and winter ranging from lows of 5&nbsp;°C (41&nbsp;°F)  to highs of 46&nbsp;°C (114.8&nbsp;°F). The prevailing winds of summer are extremely hot, extremely dry and strong, while winter winds are warm and dry. Sandstorms generally occur from March to May. In October 2008, Ghardaïa was severely affected by flooding due to heavy rain.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7648355.stm|title=Deadly floods hit Algerian oasis|work=BBC News|access-date=12 February 2013|date=2008-10-02}}</ref>

==Layout and architecture==
The unique layout of the Ghardaïa village is dictated by the rocky terrain of the region. Apart from the mosques and the housing pattern layout, with the mosque at the top of the hill, and the houses laid in labyrinthine alleyways, there is also a large market centre. The houses in particular are oriented in such a way that admits sunlight into every dwelling, as this is strongly believed to be healthy: "Inhabitants of the house where sun comes in will never see a doctor". Chimneys are also set in such a way that they do not encroach upon the comfort of neighbours.<ref name=Mozambite/>

==Economy==
[[File:Ghardaia01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Market on the main square of Ghardaïa (1970)]]
Ghardaïa is a major centre of date production, with nearly 60,000 palm trees producing dates. The wood of dead palms is used to make house roofs; live trees are not killed, as they are considered living beings that sustain the inhabitants.<ref name="Tilouine"/>

Another important industry is the manufacture of rugs and cloths.<ref name="Harris"/>

Metlili-Chaamba is known for its "Deglet Nour" dates and its camel hair products. One important aspect of the social life and economic values of the people of the region is that begging and theft are non-existent in the community. The society is close-knit, and all aspects of economy and social customs are dictated by the community.<ref name="Mozambite">{{Cite web|url=http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/reportage/2006/09/29/reportage-01|title=Ghardaïa remains unchanged as major centre of Mozabite life|access-date=12 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220045347/http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/reportage/2006/09/29/reportage-01|archive-date=20 December 2012|publisher=Magharebia|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Culture==
The residents have preserved the original medieval architecture remarkably well; the valley to which Ghardaïa belongs is part of an official [[World Heritage Site]]. The Medabian quarter lies to the northwest. The military compound and hospital are located in the southern area.<ref name="Britannica"/> The city is called "the pearl of the oasis", and is one of the most important tourist regions in southern Algeria due to its ancient cultural heritage. Apart from tourism, the Wilaya of Ghardaïa also draws anthropologists, architects, researchers and historians to explore its rich cultural, anthropological and architectural uniqueness.<ref name="Oasis">{{Cite web|url=http://translate.google.co.in/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=http://www.dtw-ghardaia.com/&ei=UrzcTJ_pFYrIuAOZidWQCg&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=15&ved=0CG4Q7gEwDg&prev=/search%3Fq%3DGharda%25C3%25AFa%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26hs%3DGbl%26sa%3DG%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26channel%3Ds%26prmd%3Dvinm|title= Ghardaia, la perle des oasis|access-date=2010-11-12|publisher=Ministry of Tourism}}</ref> An interesting aspect of community welfare is the fact that they follow the rules of governance diligently, and also contribute to the maintenance and care of the community. Mozabites in the light of their rigid approach in negotiations, dominate the financial sector, particularly in banking and wholesale sectors. They also have their own mosque, cemetery, recreation and sporting activities. They have a patriarchal system of social inheritance. Another unique feature among the Mozabites is that starting from birth a “Mozabite is looked after by the community for education, work, marriage, and the building of a home. Touiza (groups of volunteers) are organised for building houses.”<ref name="Mozambite" /> The Wilaya of Ghardaïa is also well known for its Weaving, Dinanderie D'art, basketry, pottery and carpet weaving (tapestry). The rugs of the area are so popular that every year the "National Day Of Rugs" is held in March.<ref name="Oasis" />

The Mozabites of Ghardaïa have their distinct identity of traditional costume of ''[[saroual]] loubia'' (baggy trousers) and ''chéchia'' (headgear).<ref name="Mozambite" />

=== Festivals ===
Every spring, the commune of Metlili-Chaamba, {{convert|31.3|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Ghardaïa, celebrates the "Day mehr" when people from all over the country attend and participate in a camel race.

In March and April, a carpet festival provides an opportunity for celebration, competition, as well as sales.<ref name="Ham, p. 158">Ham, p. 158</ref>

=== Religion ===
[[File:Grande Mosquée de Ghardaïa.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Great mosque of Ghardaia.]]
Ghardaïa is the traditional heart of the [[M'zab]] valley and home of the [[Ibadi]] religious sect in Algeria. They do not subscribe to the doctrines of [[Sunnism]] and [[Shi'ism]].<ref name="world" /> They practice a different way of praying, worshipping of God, and designing mosques compared to [[Maliki]]s, who form the majority of Algerians.<ref name="Mozambite" /> The wastage of water, and more generally any gift of land, is considered a sin.<ref name="Tilouine" /> The Ghardaïa Mosque, built in the 10th century, is of [[Moorish architecture]] style. Its tower, simple and elegant, includes a large portal at the top of the shaft, the design of which provides for ventilation flow.<ref name="glasssteelandstone">{{cite web|url=http://www.glasssteelandstone.com/BuildingDetail/7.php |title=Ghardaïa Mosque |publisher=glasssteelandstone.com |access-date=12 November 2010 |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115215825/http://glasssteelandstone.com/BuildingDetail/7.php |archive-date=15 January 2010 }}</ref>

The [[White Fathers]], a [[Roman Catholic]] missionary society, live in a [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]] near the old city, and have a collection of books on the Sahara.<ref name="Ham, p. 158" /> The [[pro-cathedral]] still testifies to the time when it was the seat from 1901 successively of the [[Apostolic Prefecture of Ghardaïa]]; the province was renamed as the Apostolic Prefecture of Ghardaïa in the Sahara, in 1948 promoted to the [[Apostolic Vicariate of Ghardaïa in the Sahara]], and then in 1955 was promoted to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Laghouat]] (where the cathedral is meanwhile secularized; the diocese is still exempt).

=== Jewish Sign Language ===
Until Algerian independence, Ghardaïa was home to a significant Jewish community, of which many were deaf. The deaf Jews of Ghardaïa developed [[Algerian Jewish Sign Language|their own village sign language]], which they took with them when the community left for France and Israel.
