Before the Spanish invasion the entire area was inhabited by the peoples of the [[Quimbaya civilization]] until the 10th century B.C. At the time of Spanish conquest the area was inhabited by indigenous people of [[Kalina people|Carib]] descent known as the Pijao tribes. The native population was gradually reduced due to slavery, armed confrontations, and massacres during the [[Rubber boom]], causing the territory to remain mostly uninhabited over the following centuries.  At the present time, only a small population of nearly 2000 [[Amerindians]] remains in an indigenous reservation near [[La Tebaida, Quindío|La Tebaida]].

The first settlement to be founded in the area was [[Salento, Quindío|Salento]] in 1842. In the 19th century northern peasants from [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] set out to settle in the area and their goal was to stay there permanently in a process known as Colonización antioqueña ([[Monument to Effort|Antioquian Colonisation]]). Due to the inaccessibility of the territory and the lack of roads, trade and communications were made through [[mule]] caravans ([[arriería]]) or by porters such as the [[sillero]]s. 

In 1905, the old Department of Antioquia was partitioned into two, giving rise to the new [[Department of Caldas]], which at the time included the modern department of [[Risaralda Department|Risaralda]]. In 1908 Quindio territory, then in jurisdiction of the [[Cauca Department]], was annexed to Caldas department.

Also, see [[list of governors of Quindío Department]].

== Geography ==
[[File:La Vieja River 2005-07-17.jpg|thumb|La Vieja River]]
Most of its surface is occupied for the western face of the [[Cordillera Central (Colombia)|Cordillera Central]]. Highest mountain: ([[Nevado del Quindío]]) {{convert|5,150|m|0|abbr=on}} high. The lowest area is the valley of [[La Vieja River]], {{convert|1,100|m|0|abbr=on}} high.

This department consists entirely of mountain landscapes covered in tropical [[rainforest]] and [[Guadua]] bamboo forests. The ground is enriched with ancient volcanic eruptions, raising its fertility. There are also many rivers and streams, including the [[Quindío River]] which rises in the [[Cocora Valley]].

The weather varies widely, having two rainy seasons (April and November) separated by two dry seasons. The annual precipitation is around {{convert|2,500|mm|0|abbr=on}} and comes from the humidity of winds from the [[Pacific Ocean]] being cooled as they rise over the [[Andes]]. The average temperature is between {{convert|24|°C|0|abbr=on}} in the La Vieja river valley and {{convert|16|°C|0|abbr=on}} in Salento.

== Quindío wax palm tree ==
[[File:Valle de Cocora, Colombia 02.jpg|thumb|Quindío wax palm tree is the national tree of Colombia]]
With law 61 of 1985, the Colombian Congress adopted the Quindío wax palm tree, ''[[Ceroxylon quindiuense]]'', a local endangered species adapted to high altitudes, as the National Tree. As ratified on September 16, 1985, by the then president of Colombia, [[Belisario Betancur]], the law states: "The species commonly known as the Quindío wax palm tree, scientific name Ceroxylon quindiuense, is declared the national tree and symbol of our fatherland.  The national government is empowered to buy as much land as needed to create wildlife sanctuaries with the purpose of preserving this national symbol and its natural environment. It is forbidden to cut down the Quindío wax palm tree. The punishment for doing so shall be a fine and a term in jail"."

The Quindío wax palm tree was nearly driven to extinction by the extraction of the resinous substance that it exudes. Furthermore, its leaves were widely used for the celebration of [[Holy Week procession]]s, especially that of [[Palm Sunday]].

== Economy ==
Quindío's economy is based mainly in the harvest of [[coffee plant|coffee]]. It is one of the most important producers of [[Colombian coffee]]. The department belongs to the [[Colombian Coffee-Growers Axis]] which is the center of production and export of the highest quality coffee in Colombia.  [[Plantain (cooking)|Plantain]], [[cassava]], Salentune potato and [[sugarcane]] are also cultivated, mostly for sale in local markets.

===The Quimbayan Christmas Panther===
The Quimbayan Christmas Panther is an indigenous & sacred animal recognized by indigenous and [[mestizo]] communities in the Quindío Department of Colombia. Belief in the Christmas Panther (el puma de navidad) has developed throughout the history of the Quimbayan holiday known as the Alumbrado de Navidad (see [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]]), celebrated on the 7th of December in recognition of the Roman Catholic belief in the Immaculate Conception of Christ. It is believed that the significance of the puma stems from the arrival of ethnically Spanish colonialists from [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] in the region during the 1850s. The colonialist's [[Catholic]] traditions of using candlelight to celebrate the Immaculate Conception was combined with belief of the local Quimbaya tribe in the effect that fire (luces de fogota) had in protecting against [[panther attacks]] as pumas and other local fauna are believed to fear fire. Thus, in an instance of religious [[syncretism]], the Alumbrado de Navidad and the symbolism of the puma to native peoples were linked. It is still a common practice to display the symbol of the panther (in the form of sculptures made of ''[[terra cotta]]'', cloth, plastic, etc.) in conjunction with the lighting of candles on the night of December the 7th. Such religious syncretism is especially visible in the rural [[pueblos]] of Quindío where many residents claim full or partial descent from Quimbaya native peoples of the region.(the Quimbayan christmas panther is blue with yellow tail).

== Fauna and Flora ==
[[File:Odontoglossum cruentum Orchi 01.jpg|thumb|'''''[[Odontoglossum cruentum|Odontoglossum<br />cruentum]]''''']]
Quindío is the natural habitat of 520 species of birds and about 60 species of mammals. Many of them are [[endemism]]s. The area has the largest number of [[Heliconia]] species in the world and a large numbers of species of [[orchid]]s, mainly of the genera [[Cattleya]], [[Odontoglossum]], [[Miltonia]], [[Phragmipedium]] and [[Peristeria (plant)|Peristeria]].  The natural forests typical of the area, such as the [[páramo]], and the [[cloud forest]], are decreasing progressively due to agricultural activities.  As a result, many of the endemic species are threatened, endangered or critically endangered.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Some of them are:  
* [[Yellow-eared parrot]]
* [[Andean guan]]
* [[Colombian weasel]]
* [[Epicrionops columbianus]] [[caecilian]]
* [[Mano de Oso]] tree.
