'''Osh''' ({{IPAc-en|ɒ|ʃ|}}, {{IPA|ky|ɔɕ|lang}}, {{IPA|ru|oʂ|lang|}}) is the second-largest city in [[Kyrgyzstan]], located in the [[Fergana Valley]] in the south of the country. It is often referred to as the "capital of the south".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://geohistory.today/osh-fergana-valley/|title=Osh & The Fergana Valley|date=2017-02-28|work=GeoHistory|access-date=2018-09-20|language=en-US}}</ref> It is the oldest city in the country (estimated by UNESCO<ref>{{Cite news |last=UNESCO |first=UNESCO |date=2 March 2024 |title=The Diary of Young Explorers: The City of Osh, Kyrgyzstan |url=https://fr.unesco.org/silkroad/node/9538 |access-date=2 March 2024 |work=UNESCO}}</ref> to be more than 3,000 years old) and has served as the administrative center of [[Osh Region]] since 1939. The city has an ethnically mixed population of 322,164 {{As of|2021|alt=in 2021}},<ref name=pop21/> comprising  [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], [[Uzbeks]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Koryo-saram|Koreans]], and other smaller ethnic groups.

==Overview==
Osh has an important outdoor activity [[bazaar]] which has been taking place on the same spot for the past 2,000 years and was a major market along the [[Silk Road]]. The city's industrial base, established during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, largely collapsed after the break-up of the Soviet Union and has only recently{{when|date=December 2022}} started to revive.

The proximity of the [[Uzbekistan]] border, which cuts through historically linked territories and settlements, deprives Osh of much of its former [[hinterland]] and presents a serious obstacle to trade and economic development. Daily flights from [[Osh Airport]] link Osh—and hence the southern part of Kyrgyzstan—to the national capital [[Bishkek]] and some international destinations, mainly in Russia. Osh has two railway stations and a railway connection to [[Andijan]] in neighbouring Uzbekistan, but no passenger traffic and only sporadic freight traffic. Most transport is by road. The recent{{when|date=December 2022}} upgrading of the long and arduous road through the mountains to Bishkek has greatly improved communications.

The city has several monuments, including one to the southern Kyrgyz leader ({{lang-ky|датка|datqa}}) [[Kurmanjan Datka|Kurmanjan]] and one of the few remaining statues of [[Lenin]]. A [[Russian Orthodox]] church, reopened after the demise of the Soviet Union, the second-largest [[mosque]] in the country, built in 2012<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rus.azattyk.org/a/kyrgyzstan_osh_sulaiman_too/24617564.html|title=Сулайман-Тоо: музей vs мечеть(Радио Азаттык)|date=18 June 2012 |language=ru|access-date=2022-03-09}}</ref>  and situated beside the bazaar, and the 16th-century Rabat Abdul Khan Mosque can be found here. The only [[World Heritage Site]] in Kyrgyzstan, the [[Sulayman Mountain]], offers a splendid view of Osh and its environs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://caravanistan.com/kyrgyzstan/south/osh/|title=Osh Travel Guide {{!}} Caravanistan|website=Caravanistan|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-20}}</ref>

This mountain is thought by some researchers and historians to be the famous landmark of antiquity known as the "[[Stone Tower (Ptolemy)|Stone Tower]]", which [[Claudius Ptolemaeus|Claudius Ptolemy]] wrote about in his famous work [[Geography (Ptolemy)|''Geography'']]. It marked the midpoint on the ancient [[Silk Road]], the overland trade route taken by caravans between Europe and Asia.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Dean |first=Riaz |title=The Stone Tower: Ptolemy, the Silk Road, and a 2,000-Year-Old Riddle |publisher=Penguin Viking |year=2022 |isbn=978-0670093625 |location=Delhi |pages=173–85 |language=English}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal

Osh is home to [[Osh State University]], one of the largest universities in Kyrgyzstan.

==Administration==
Osh city (Ош шаар, "Osh shaar") covers {{convert|182.5|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}}<ref name=census09/> and, like the capital city of Bishkek, is administered separately and not part of any region, although it is the seat of [[Osh Region]].<ref name=class>{{cite web|url=https://stat.gov.kg/media/files/21f93e4d-9418-433e-aed9-ecb28d70ef5a.doc|title=Classification system of territorial units of the Kyrgyz Republic|language=ky|date=May 2021|publisher=National Statistics Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic|pages=81–82}}</ref> Besides the city proper, 11 villages are administered by the city: Almalyk, Arek, Gulbaar-Tölöykön, [[Japalak]], Kengesh, Kerme-Too, Orke, Pyatiletka, Teeke and parts of Ozgur and [[Tölöykön, Kara-Suu|Tölöykön]].<ref name="class"/>

==Population==
Osh is the second-largest city in Kyrgyzstan after the capital city of [[Bishkek]]. According to the population estimate of 2021, the city population amounted to 322,164, of which 33,315 resided in the 11 villages that the City of Osh administers.<ref name="pop21" /> At the 2009 census, 47.9% of the population were Kyrgyz, 44.2% were Uzbeks, 2.5% Russians, 2.2% [[Turkish people|Turks]], 1.1% [[Tatars]] and 2.1% other nationalities.<ref name=census09/> The population of the built-up (or metro) area in the surrounding [[Kara-Suu District]] and in neighbouring Uzbekistan is estimated at 400,000 inhabitants.

==History==

===Early history===
The name of the city of Osh derives from the river [[Vakhsh (river)|Vakhsh]], anthropomorphised there as a water goddess of the same name, who was worshipped (in tandem with [[Atar]], sacred fire) in a Zoroastrian shrine or fire temple situated in the Eagle Cave in the ancient sacred mountain [[Sulayman Mountain|Sulaiman-Too]]. The river Vakhsh itself, known also as Surkhob  or Kyzyl-Suu ( Turkic: “red water”) is a tributary of the Amu Darya, the course of the Vakhsh lying outside and to the South of the Fergana valley, rising as it does on the west side of the 3,536m Taunmurun pass (east of the village of [[Sary-Tash]]) <ref>https://central-asia.guide/kyrgyzstan/destinations-kg/osh/alai-valley/ Retrieved at 1.56 on Sunday 19/5/24.</ref><ref>Middleton, Robert and Thomas, Huw with Whitlock, Monica and Hauser, Markus, ''Tajikistan and the High Pamirs: a Companion and Guide'', pub. 2012 by Odyssey Books and Guides, ISBN 978-962-217-818-2, pps.263-4 (map of Eastern Tajikistan shows location of Taunmurun Pass and altitude).</ref> and flowing southwest to its confluence with the [[Panj (river)|Panj]] at [[Takht-i Sangin]] to form the Amu Darya.
Oxus, the ancient name of the Amu Darya, like Osh, is cognate with the river name Vakhsh, revealing that the present day Vakhsh/Kyzyl-Suu was conceived to form the upper reaches of the river now known as the Amu Darya.<ref>A little history of the city of Osh https://osh-hospital.narod.ru/history_osh.htm; Live the East. info@centralasia-travel.com; Retrieved 17/4/2024.</ref><ref>http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/uzbekistan/index.htm Retrieved at 1.53 on Sunday 19/5/24.</ref>

[[File:He inhabitants of Osh (Ūsh) drive the enemy out with sticks and clubs and hold the town for Babur.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The inhabitants of Osh repulse the occupiers of their city and assist [[Babur]].]]

The city is among the oldest settlements in [[Central Asia]]. Osh was known as early as the 8th century as a center for silk production along the [[Silk Road]]. The famous trading route crossed [[Alay Mountains]] to reach [[Kashgar]] to the east.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Kyrgyz Republic : Kyrgyzstan : heart of Central Asia|last=Rowan.|first=Stewart|date=2008|publisher=Odyssey Books & Guides|others=Weldon, Susie., Harris, Paul, 1958 September 28-, Fairclough, Ceri.|isbn=9789622177918|edition= 3rd|location=Hong Kong|oclc=154707602}}</ref>

[[Babur]], founder of the [[Mughal Empire]] and descendant of [[Tamerlane]], was born in nearby [[Andijan]], in the [[Fergana Valley]], pondered his future on Sulayman Mountain and even constructed a mosque atop of the mountain. Babur somehow concludes that the confines of the Fergana would cramp his aspirations as a descendant of famous conquering warrior princes. He wrote of the city:

<blockquote> "There are many sayings about the excellence of Osh. On the southeastern side of the Osh fortress is a well-proportioned mountain called Bara-Koh, where, on its summit, Sultan Mahmud Khan built a pavilion. Farther down, on a spur of the same mountain, I had a porticoed pavilion built in 902 (1496-7)" <ref>" The Babur-nama" Ed. & trans. Wheeler M. Thackston (New York) 2002 pp4-5</ref></blockquote>

===Imperial Russian and Soviet rule===
The city was occupied and annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1876 when Russia overwhelmed the Central Asian [[khanates]] during the so-called "[[Great Game]]", the contest between [[British Empire|Britain]] and Russia for dominance in [[Central Asia]]. This conquest was achieved and the inclusion to the Russian Empire made by the mid-1880s, with main credit to General von Kaufman and General [[Mikhail Skobelev]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In the 1960s Osh and other towns in the south of the [[Kyrgyz SSR]] began to be industrialized. The population of Osh and other towns in the Fergana Valley that falls within Kyrgyzstan has traditionally consisted of a significant number of ethnic Uzbeks.<ref name=KIC>{{cite web|title=Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry into the Events in Southern Kyrgyzstan in June 2010|url=http://www.kgzembind.in/Report%20(English).pdf|work=The Independent International Commission of Inquiry (KIC)|access-date=22 April 2012}}</ref> When Osh started to industrialize the ethnic "Kyrgyz were encouraged to move from the Kyrgyz populated countryside to the cities to work in industrial jobs and public administration."<ref name=KIC /> This contributed to the rise of social tension between the two groups.

===1990 riots===
{{Main|Osh riots (1990)}}
In 1990, shortly before the end of Soviet power in Central Asia, Osh and its environs experienced bloody [[Osh riots (1990)|ethnic clashes]] between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks. There were about 1,200 casualties, including over 300 dead and 462 seriously injured.<ref name=KIC /> The riots broke out over the division of land resources in and around the city.<ref>{{cite book

===2010 ethnic violence===
{{Main|Ethnic Violence in Southern Kyrgyzstan (2010)}}
In 2010, after [[2010 Kyrgyzstani riots|riots]] in [[Bishkek]] and other major Kyrgyz cities, President [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]] took refuge in the city to hide from protesters denouncing his government and its response to the nation's struggling economy. On May 13, 2010, Bakiyev supporters took over government buildings in Osh and seized the airport, preventing interim government officials from landing.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.rferl.org/content/Bakiev_Supporters_Take_Over_Government_Building_In_Osh/2040630.html |title= Former Kyrgyz President's Supporters Take Over Government Buildings In South |date=13 May 2010|work=[[Radio Free Europe]]|access-date=13 May 2010}}</ref> The protesters demanded Bakiev's return, and forced the regional governor to flee. The former Osh regional governor [[Mamasadyk Bakirov]] was reinstated.

On June 10, 2010, riots erupted in Osh, killing at least 81 and injuring hundreds of others.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100617034849/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gS-xs7sBguewttUyAhxKUWRgnRzAD9GAC6800 google.com] 12 June 2010</ref> "An explosion of violence, destruction and looting in southern Kyrgyzstan on 11–14 June 2010 killed many dozens of Kyrgyz and Uzbek people. The total of over 2000 buildings were destroyed, mostly homes, and deepened the divide between the country's ethnic Kyrgyz and Uzbeks."<ref name=ICG:Pogroms>{{cite web|title=The Pogroms in Kyrgyzstan|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/asia/central-asia/kyrgyzstan/193-the-pogroms-in-kyrgyzstan.aspx|work=[[International Crisis Group]]|access-date=22 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603121239/http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/asia/central-asia/kyrgyzstan/193-the-pogroms-in-kyrgyzstan.aspx|archive-date=3 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Local media reported that gangs of young men armed with sticks and stones smashed shop windows and set cars aflame in the city center. Several buildings and homes across the city were also set on fire. The city's police force proved incapable of restoring order resulting in a state of emergency being declared and the [[Military of Kyrgyzstan|army]] being mobilised.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gS-xs7sBguewttUyAhxKUWRgnRzAD9G8RUS80 |title=Twelve killed in new wave of unrest in Kyrgyzstan |date=10 June 2010|agency=[[Associated Press]]|access-date=10 June 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

The Kyrgyz intelligence agency claimed that the just-deposed president initiated the 2010 violence, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, who is said to have made a deal with foreign narco-jihadist gangs to take over southern Kyrgyzstan and initiate a shariah state in exchange for the Bakiyev family's being returned to controlling Bishkek.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wsinform.com/world/Bishkek-obvinil-Bakieva-v-finansirovanii-popytki-gosperevorota/|title=Бишкек обвинил Бакиева в финансировании попытки госпереворота|website=Wsinform.com}}</ref> However, to the day no serious proof has been presented to the public and media. According to various sources, up to 100,000 ethnic Uzbek refugees fled to Uzbekistan. Many refugee camps have been organized in the Andijan, Fergana and Namangan regions of Uzbekistan for Uzbek citizens of Kyrgyzstan who cross the border seeking safety.
