'''Lima''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|m|ə}} {{respell|LEE|mə}}; {{IPA|es|ˈlima|local}}), founded in 1535 as the '''Ciudad de los Reyes''' ({{IPA|es|sjuˈdat de los ˈreʝes|local}}, Spanish for "City of [[Biblical Magi|Kings]]"), is the capital and largest city of [[Peru]]. It is located in the valleys of the [[Chillón River|Chillón]], [[Rímac River|Rímac]] and [[Lurín River]]s, in the desert zone of the central coastal part of the country, overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The city is considered the political, cultural, financial and commercial center of Peru. Due to its geostrategic importance, the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]] has categorized it as a "beta" tier city. Jurisdictionally, the metropolis extends mainly within the [[province of Lima]] and in a smaller portion, to the west, within the [[Constitutional Province of Callao]], where the seaport and the [[Jorge Chávez Airport]] are located. Both provinces have regional autonomy since 2002.

The 2023 census projection indicates that the city of Lima has an estimated population of 10,092,000 inhabitants, making it the most populated city in the country, and the second most populous in the Americas after São Paulo.<ref name="inei20p33">{{harvnb|INEI (Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática)|2023|p=23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/America.html|title=America: Population Statistics in Maps and Charts for Cities, Agglomerations and Administrative Divisions of all Countries in America|website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref> Together with the seaside city of [[Callao]], it forms a contiguous urban area known as the [[Lima Metropolitan Area]], which encompasses a total of 10,151,200 inhabitants.<ref name="inei20p33"/><ref group="note">This includes the 43 districts of the Lima province</ref> When considering the constitutional province of [[Callao]], the total agglomeration reaches a population of 11,342,100 inhabitants, one of the [[List of urban areas by population|thirty most populated urban agglomerations in the world]].

Lima was named by natives in the agricultural region known by [[native Peruvians]] as ''Limaq''. It became the capital and most important city in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. Following the [[Peruvian War of Independence]], it became the capital of the Republic of Peru (República del Perú). Around one-third of the national population now lives in its [[Lima Metropolitan Area|metropolitan area]].

In October 2013, Lima was chosen to host the [[2019 Pan American Games]]; these games were held at venues in and around Lima, and were the largest sporting event ever hosted by the country. It also hosted the [[APEC]] Meetings of 2008 and 2016, the [[Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group]] in October 2015, the [[2014 United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in December 2014, and the [[Miss Universe 1982]] contest.

==Etymology==
According to early Spanish articles, the Lima area was once called ''Itchyma'',{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} after its original inhabitants. However, even before the [[Inca]] occupation of the area in the 15th century, a famous oracle in the [[Rímac Valley]] had come to be known by visitors as ''Limaq'' ('''Limaq''', pronounced {{IPA|qu|ˈli.mɑq|}}, which means "talker" or "speaker" in the [[Quechua II|coastal Quechua]] that was the area's primary language before the Spanish arrival). This oracle was eventually destroyed by the Spanish and replaced with a church, but the name persisted: the chronicles show "Límac" replacing "Ychma" as the common name for the area.<ref name="Limaq">{{cite web |url=http://aymara.org/biblio/lima_etimologia.pdf |title=Limaq |access-date=10 October 2009 |language=es}}</ref>

Modern scholars speculate that the word "Lima" originated as the Spanish pronunciation of the native name Limaq. Linguistic evidence seems to support this theory, as spoken Spanish consistently rejects [[stop consonant]]s in word-final position.

The city was founded in 1535 under the name City of [[Biblical Magi|Kings]] ({{Langx|es|link=no|Ciudad de los Reyes}}), because its foundation was decided on January 
6, date of the feast of the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]. This name quickly fell into disuse, and ''Lima'' became the city's name of choice; on the oldest Spanish maps of Peru, both ''Lima'' and ''Ciudad de los Reyes'' can be seen together.

The river that feeds Lima is called ''[[Rímac River|Rímac]]'', and many people erroneously assume that this is because its original Inca name is "Talking River" (the Incas spoke a highland variety of Quechua, in which the word for "talker" was pronounced {{IPA|qu|ˈrimɑq|}}).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blog.pucp.edu.pe/blog/blogderedaccion/2012/04/22/el-origen-del-nombre-de-nuestra-capital/ |title=El origen del nombre de nuestra capital |trans-title=The origin of the name of our capital |publisher=Pontifical Catholic University of Peru |date=22 April 2012 |access-date=18 June 2020 |language=es}}</ref> However, the original inhabitants of the valley were not Incas. This name is an innovation arising from an effort by the [[Cusco|Cuzco]] nobility in colonial times to standardize the toponym so that it would conform to the phonology of [[Cusco Quechua|Cuzco Quechua]].

Later, as the original inhabitants died out and the local [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] became extinct, the Cuzco pronunciation prevailed. Nowadays, Spanish-speaking locals do not see the connection between the name of their city and the name of the river that runs through it. They often assume that the valley is named after the river; however, Spanish documents from the colonial period show the opposite to be true.<ref name="Limaq" />

==Symbols==
===Flag===
{{Main|Flag of Lima}}
The [[Flag of Lima]] is historically known as "Banner of the City of the Kings of Peru". It is formed by a [[Gold (color)|golden-colored]] silk canvas and in the center is the embroidered coat of arms of the city.<ref name="flag">{{cite web |url=http://heralatin.t35.com/peru/lima.html |title=Ciudad de Lima |website=Heráldica Latinoamericana |access-date=11 February 2015 |language=es |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810152715/http://heralatin.t35.com/peru/lima.html |archive-date=10 August 2011}}</ref>

===Coat of arms===
{{Main|Coat of arms of Lima}}
The [[coat of arms of Lima]] was granted by the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish Crown]] on 7 December 1537, through a ''[[real cédula]]'' signed in [[Valladolid]] by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] and his mother, Queen [[Joanna of Castile]]. It is formed by a main field [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]], with three [[Crown (heraldry)|gold crowns of kings]] placed in a triangle and above them a gold star that touches the three crowns with its points, and in the [[Orle (heraldry)|orle]] some gold letters that say: ''Hoc signum vere regum est (This is the true sign of the kings).'' Outside the shield are the initials I and K (Ioana and Karolus), which are the names of Queen Joanna and her son Charles V. A star is placed above the letters and two crowned [[sabre]]-faced eagles embracing them, which hold the coat of arms.

===Anthem===
The anthem of Lima was heard for the first time on 18 January 2008, in a solemn session that was attended by the then [[President of Peru]] [[Alan García]], the mayor of the city [[Luis Castañeda|Luis Castañeda Lossio]] and various authorities. Those in charge of creating the anthem were the [[councillor]]s Luis Enrique Tord (author of the lyrics), Euding Maeshiro (composer of the melody) and the musical producer Ricardo Núñez (arranger).<ref>{{cite news |year=2008 |url=http://peru21.pe/noticia/75506/lima-tiene-dos-himnos-que-nadie-ha-escuchado |title=Lima tiene dos himnos que nadie ha escuchado |newspaper=Perú.21 |access-date=11 February 2015 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002207/http://peru21.pe/noticia/75506/lima-tiene-dos-himnos-que-nadie-ha-escuchado }}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Lima|Timeline of Lima}}

===Pre-Columbian era===
[[File:Pachacamac Mamacona2.jpg|thumb|[[Pachacámac]], built from 3rd century to 15th century, was one of the most important pre-Columbian centers of pilgrimage on the Peruvian Coast.<ref name="Guide to Peru">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIIgCgAAQBAJ&dq=casa+de+osambela&pg=PT108|title=The Rough Guide to Peru|publisher=[[Rough Guides]]|location=[[England]]|year=2015|isbn=978-0-241-24692-4}}</ref> In the image the Temple of the Moon.]]

Although the history of the city of Lima began with its Spanish foundation in 1535, the territory formed by the valleys of the [[Rímac River|Rímac]], [[Chillón River|Chillón]] and [[Lurín River|Lurín]] rivers was occupied by pre-Inca settlements, which were grouped under the [[Ichma culture|Lordship of Ichma]].{{sfn|Conlee|Dulanto|Mackay|Stanish|2004|p= 218}} The Maranga culture and the [[Lima culture]] were the ones that established and forged an identity in these territories. During those times, the sanctuaries of Lati (current [[Puruchuco]]) and [[Pachacámac]] (the main pilgrimage sanctuary during the time of the Incas) were built, it was built from 3rd century to 15th century by several civilizations, and which was used even until the time the [[Conquistador|Spanish conquistadors]] arrived.

These cultures were conquered by the [[Wari culture|Wari Empire]] during the height of its imperial expansion. It is during this time that the ceremonial center of [[Cajamarquilla]] was built.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wmf.org/project/cajamarquilla-archaeological-site|title=Cajamarquilla Archaeological Site - World Monuments Watch - 2006|website=[[World Monuments Fund]]}}</ref><ref name="James Higgins">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YErY-1GD7o8C&dq=Lima:+A+cultural+history&pg=PP1|title=Lima: A Cultural History|author=James Higgins|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=0-19-517890-4|pages=22, 45}}</ref> As Wari importance declined, local cultures regained autonomy, highlighting the [[Chancay culture]]. Later, in the 15th century, these territories were incorporated into the [[Inca Empire]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://es.calameo.com/read/0005981349455e89ae19a|title=Identidad - Cultura Chancay|author=Alberto Colán Falcón|page=1}}</ref> From this time we can find a great variety of [[huaca]]s throughout the city, some of which are under investigation.

The most important or well-known huacas are those of [[Huaca Huallamarca|Huallamarca]], [[Huaca Pucllana|Pucllana]], and Mateo Salado, all located in the middle of Lima districts with very high urban growth, so they are surrounded by business and residential buildings; however, that does not prevent its perfect state of conservation.

During the time of the Incas, the valley of Lima was highly populated and organized into an Inca province, or huamani (wamani), called Pachacamac. The colonial Spanish historian [[Bernabé Cobo]] mentions that the huamani of Pachacamac was subdivided into three hunu of tributary men, rather than the conventional four hunu. It has also been argued that a fourth hunu may have existed but was not recorded.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal |last1=Díaz |first1=Luisa |last2=Vallejo |first2=Francisco |date=2002-04-09 |title=Armatambo y el dominio incaico en el valle de Lima |url=https://revistas.pucp.edu.pe/index.php/boletindearqueologia/article/view/1856 |journal=Boletín de Arqueología PUCP |issue=6 |pages=355–374 |doi=10.18800/boletindearqueologiapucp.200201.014 |issn=2304-4292}}</ref> The primary meaning of the word hunu in Quechua is 10,000, leading to the assumption that 30,000 families lived in the valley. This assumption has been criticized, including by the historian Åke Wedin, because hunu can also mean countless, and therefore could simply refer to a very large group of men. The scholar [[John Howland Rowe|John Rowe]] suggested that the valley had a population of about 150,000 during Inca times.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gonzáles |first=César W. Astuhuamán |date=2011-01-01 |title=The concept of Inca province at Tawantinsuyu |url=https://journals.iai.spk-berlin.de/index.php/indiana/article/view/2002 |journal=INDIANA - Estudios Antropológicos sobre América Latina y el Caribe |language=en |volume=28 |pages=79–107 |doi=10.18441/ind.v28i0.79-107 |issn=2365-2225}}</ref>

Whatever the case, each recorded hunu of Pachacamac had a head town, corresponding to some of the most populated settlements in the valley: Caraguayllo ([[Carabayllo District|Carabayllo]]), Maranga, and Surco (or Sulco, also known as the archaeological site Armatambo).<ref name=":2" /><blockquote>... this valley was divided, according to the government of the Inca kings, into three 'unos' or governorships of ten thousand families each; the town of Caraguayllo was the head of the first; that of Maranga, which is situated in the middle of the valley, of the second, and the third, that of Surco; this last town was the largest of all ...<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cobo |first=Bernabé |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=opOPx386EzYC&pg=PA42 |title=Historia de la fundación de Lima |date=1882 |publisher=Imprenta liberal |language=es}}</ref></blockquote>The inhabitants of the pre-Columbian town of Surco were relocated to the modern district of Santiago de Surco early in the colonial period. In addition to Aymara and Quechua, the inhabitants of the northern part of the valley, specifically in the hunu of Carabayllo, spoke an additional language believed to be [[Quingnam]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lenguas supérstites del Tahuantinsuyo |url=https://elperuano.pe/noticia/86091-lenguas-superstites-del-tahuantinsuyo |access-date=2024-07-22 |website=elperuano.pe |language=es}}</ref>

Regarding the pre-Hispanic settlement of Lima, it is recorded that this part of the valley, near the Rimac river, was administered by a curaca, or local lord, named Taulichusco. He was a former [[Yanakuna|yana]], or servant, of Mama Vilo, one of the wives of Emperor Huayna Capac. Lima was awarded to Taulichusco in recognition of his services to the Inca royalty. Some of Peru's most important buildings were erected on the sites of major constructions of the pre-Hispanic settlement. For example, the residential palace of Taulichusco was located where the modern [[Palacio de Gobierno]] of Peru stands today. A temple called Puma Inti once occupied the site where the [[Cathedral of Lima]] is now, and the [[Teatro Municipal de Lima|Municipal Theatre of Lima]] is situated where a pre-Columbian structure, referred to as Huaca El Cabildo by the Spaniards, once stood. These buildings were centered around a plaza, which was later expanded to become the [[Plaza Mayor de Lima|Plaza Mayor]]. The Huaca de Aliaga and Huaca Riquelme were other major buildings near the plaza. Other nearby constructions included the temple-oracle of Rímac, one of the main places of worship in the valley, also known as the so-called "huaca grande" that once stood in [[Barrios Altos]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Guzmán-García |first=Carlos Enrique |date=2012-01-01 |title=REDESCUBRIENDO LIMA INCA, Carlos Enrique Guzmán (2012) |url=https://www.academia.edu/50845131 |journal=Arquivisión}}</ref>

===Spanish founding===
[[File:Old Coat of arms of Lima.svg|thumb|upright|The colonial [[Coat of arms of Lima|Lima's coat of arms]] official since 7 December 1537<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r0_po3dEBqwC&q=escudo+de+lima|title=Colección de documentos literarios del Peru: Lima fundada|author=Pedro de Peralta Barnuevo Rocha y Benavides|year=1863|publisher=Establecimiento de tipografía y encuadernación de A. Alfaro}}</ref>]]

In 1532, the Spanish and their indigenous allies (from the ethnic groups subdued by the Incas) under the command of [[Francisco Pizarro]] took monarch [[Atahualpa]] prisoner in the city of [[Cajamarca]]. Although a ransom was paid, he was sentenced to death for political and strategic reasons. After some battles, the Spanish [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|conquered their empire]]. The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Crown]] named Francisco Pizarro governor of the lands he had conquered. Pizarro decided to found the capital in the Rímac river valley,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sisbib.unmsm.edu.pe/Exposiciones/FundLima/fundacion/fundacion_Lima.htm|title=Historia de la Fundación de Lima|publisher=[[National University of San Marcos]]}}</ref> after a failed attempt to establish it in [[Jauja]].

He considered that Lima was strategically located, close to a favorable coast for the construction of a [[Callao|port]] but prudently far from it in order to prevent attacks by [[Piracy|pirates]] and foreign powers, on fertile lands and with a suitable cool climate. Thus, on 6 January 1535, Lima was founded with the name "City of the Kings", named in this way in honor of the [[Epiphany (holiday)|epiphany]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MmrhAybM6lMC&dq=city+of+the+kings+lima+epiphany&pg=PA34|title=Peru. Incidents of Travel and Exploration in the Land of the Incas|author=[[Ephraim George Squier]]|date=1877|publisher=[[Macmillan Inc.]]|isbn=978-1-59884-777-2|page=34}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brown.edu/Facilities/John_Carter_Brown_Library/exhibitions/peru/peru/lima.php|title=Lima, City of Kings|website=brown.edu}}</ref> on territories that had been of the [[kuraka]] [[Taulichusco]]. The explanation of this name is due to the fact that "around the same time in January, the Spaniards were looking for the place to lay the foundation for the new city, [...] not far from the [[Pachacámac]] sanctuary, near the [[Rímac River|Rímac river]].

However, as had happened with the region, initially called [[Governorate of New Castile|New Castile]] and later [[Peru]], the City of the Kings soon lost its name in favor of "Lima". Pizarro, with the collaboration of [[Nicolás de Ribera]], Diego de Agüero and Francisco Quintero personally traced the [[Plaza Mayor de Lima|Plaza Mayor]] and the rest of the city grid, building the Viceroyalty Palace (today transformed into the [[Government Palace, Peru|Government Palace of Peru]], which hence retains the traditional name of ''Casa de Pizarro'') and the [[Lima Metropolitan Cathedral|Cathedral]], whose first stone Pizarro laid with his own hands.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-9m2UTFCGkC&dq=Settlements%20in%20the%20Americas%3A%20Cross-Cultural%20Perspectives&pg=PP1|title=Settlements in the Americas: Cross-cultural Perspectives|author=Ralph Francis Bennett - Center for Renaissance and Baroque Studies|year=1986|publisher=[[University of Delaware Press]]|isbn=0-87413-411-0|page=35}}</ref> In August 1536, the flourishing city was besieged by the troops of the Inca general Quizu Yupanqui under orders from the monarch [[Manco Inca Yupanqui]] who was in Cusco, but the Spanish and their indigenous allies managed to defeat them. The [[Huaylas Province|Huaylas]] (Wayllas) army's assistance was of special importance to the Spanish. The army arrived personally led by Contarhuancho<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rostworowski |first=María |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDtFDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT22 |title=Doña Francisca Pizarro: Una ilustre mestiza 1534-1598 |date=2017-12-28 |publisher=Instituto de Estudios Peruanos |isbn=978-9972-51-667-2 |language=en}}</ref> (Kuntur-Wanchu), a secondary wife of the deceased Emperor [[Wayna Qhapaq]] and now a respected kuraka of half the province of Huaylas, the Hanan Huaylas or Upper Huaylas moiety. Contarhuancho came to Lima after receiving a plea for help in a quipu message from her daughter, the Huaylas-Inca princess Doña [[Inés Huaylas Yupanqui]].

In the following years, Lima gained prestige by being designated the capital of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] and the seat of a ''[[Real Audiencia]]'' in 1543. Since the location of the coastal city was conditioned by the ease of communications with [[Spain]], a close bond with the port of [[Callao]] was soon established.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.juntadeandalucia.es/export/drupaljda/publicacion/21/05/60acb153b9883-guia_lima_y_callao.pdf|location=Lima, Seville|title=Lima and El Callao - An Architectural and Landscape Guide|isbn=978-84-7595-215-4|year=2009|last1=Tolla|first1=Enrique Bonilla di |publisher=Universidad Ricardo Palma}}</ref>

===Colonial time===
[[File:Plaza de Armas, Lima.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Renaissance]] [[Lima Metropolitan Cathedral]], built between 1602 and 1797 in the [[Plaza Mayor de Lima]]]]
[[File:Basílica y Convento de San Francisco de Lima, Peru.jpg|thumb|250x250px|[[Basilica and Convent of San Francisco, Lima|Basilica of San Francisco]], built between 1657 and 1672]]
For the next century, it prospered as the center of an extensive trade network that integrated the viceroyalty with the [[Americas]], [[Europe]], and [[East Asia]]. But the city was not without its dangers; violent earthquakes destroyed a large part of it between 1586 and 1687, leading to a great deal of construction activity. It is then when [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]s, [[Starling (structure)|starlings]] and retaining walls appear before the flooding of the rivers, the bridge over the [[Rímac District|Rímac]] is finished, the [[Lima Metropolitan Cathedral|cathedral]] is built, and numerous hospitals, convents and monasteries are built. Then we can see that the city is articulated around its neighborhoods. Another threat was the presence of [[pirate]]s and [[Privateer|corsair]]s in the [[Pacific Ocean]], which motivated the construction of the [[Walls of Lima]] between 1684 and 1687.<ref name="James Higgins"/>

The [[1687 Peru earthquake|1687 earthquake]] marked a turning point in the [[history of Lima]], since it coincided with a recession in trade due to economic competition with other cities such as [[Buenos Aires]]. With the creation of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] in 1717, the political demarcations were reorganized, and Lima only lost some territories that actually already enjoyed their autonomy. In 1746 a [[1746 Lima–Callao earthquake|strong earthquake]] severely damaged the city and destroyed [[Callao]], forcing a massive reconstruction effort by [[Viceroy]] [[José Manso de Velasco, 1st Count of Superunda|José Antonio Manso de Velasco]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Charles Walker|year=2003|title=The Upper Classes and Their Upper Stories: Architecture and the Aftermath of the Lima Earthquake of 1746|journal=Hispanic American Historical Review|volume=83|issue=1|publisher=Hispanic American Historical Review - [[Duke University Press]]|pages=53–55|doi=10.1215/00182168-83-1-53|s2cid=144925044|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/38926}}</ref>

In the second half of the 18th century, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas about [[public health]] and social control influenced the development of the city. During this period, the Peruvian capital was affected by the [[Bourbon reforms]] as it lost its monopoly on foreign trade and its control over the important mining region of [[Upper Peru]]. This economic weakening led the elite of the city to depend on the positions granted by the viceregal government and the [[Catholic Church|Church]], which contributed to keeping them more linked to the Crown than to the cause of independence.

The greatest political-economic impact that the city experienced at that time occurred with the creation of the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] in 1776, which changed the course and orientations imposed by the new mercantile traffic. Among the buildings built during this period there is the Coliseo de Gallos, the [[Plaza de toros de Acho|Acho Bullring]] and the General Cemetery. The first two were erected to regulate these popular activities, centralizing them in one place, while the cemetery put an end to the practice of burying the dead in churches, considered unhealthy by public authorities.

===Independence===
[[File:La Independencia del Perú.jpg|thumb|[[Proclamación de la Independencia del Perú|Painting]] of [[José de San Martín]] during the Declaration of Independence of Peru in the [[Plaza Mayor de Lima]], on July 28, 1821]]
A combined expedition of Argentine and Chilean independence fighters led by General Don [[José de San Martín]] landed in southern Lima in 1820, but did not attack the city. Faced with a naval blockade and guerrilla action on the mainland, Viceroy [[José de la Serna, 1st Count of the Andes|José de la Serna]] was forced to evacuate the city in July 1821 to save the [[Royalist (Spanish American independence)|Royalist army]]. Fearing a popular uprising and lacking the means to impose the order, the City Council invited San Martín to enter the city, signing a Declaration of Independence at his request.

By the time the war was decided, on 9 December 1824, at the [[Battle of Ayacucho]], Lima had been considerably impoverished.

After the War of Independence, Lima became the capital of the [[Republic of Peru]], but the country's economic stagnation and political disorder paralyzed its urban development. This situation was reversed in the 1850s, when the growing public and private income derived from the export of [[guano]] allowed a rapid expansion of the city. In the following twenty years, the State financed the construction of large public buildings to replace the old viceregal establishments, among these are the Central Market, the General Slaughterhouse, the Mental Asylum, the [[Lima Penitentiary|Penitentiary]] and the Hospital Dos de Mayo. There were also improvements in communications; in 1850 a railway line between Lima and Callao was completed and in 1870 an iron bridge was inaugurated over the Rímac River, baptized as Puente Balta. In 1872 the [[Walls of Lima|colonial City Walls]] were demolished by the US engineer [[Henry Meiggs]] under contract with the Peruvian government,<ref>{{cite book|author=John Carlos Rowe |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2000|title=Literary Culture and U.S. Imperialism.

However, this period of economic expansion also widened the gap between rich and poor, producing widespread social unrest.

During the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–1883), the [[Occupation of Lima|Chilean army occupied Lima]] after defeating Peruvian troops and reserves in the battles of [[Battle of San Juan and Chorrillos|San Juan]] and [[Battle of Miraflores|Miraflores]]. The city suffered from the invaders, who looted museums, public libraries and educational institutions. At the same time, angry mobs attacked wealthy citizens and the Asian colony, looting their properties and businesses.

===20th century===
At the beginning of the 20th century, the construction of avenues that would serve as a matrix for the development of the city began.<ref>{{cite book|title=Dignos de su arte: sujeto y lazo social en el Perú de las primeras décadas del siglo XX|author=Kathya Araujo|year=2009|publisher=Iberoamericana Editorial|isbn=978-84-8489-387-5|page=48|location=Santiago de Chile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oW_7r0lptNQC&dq=Dignos%20de%20su%20arte%3A%20Sujeto%20y%20lazo%20social%20en%20el%20Per%C3%BA%20de%20las%20primeras%20d%C3%A9cadas%20del%20siglo%20XX&pg=PA1}}</ref> The avenues [[Paseo de la República]], Leguía (today called Arequipa), Brasil and the landscaping Salaverry that headed south and Venezuela and Colonial avenues to the west joining the port of [[Callao]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o4mSxP9ckEkC&dq=%C2%ABA%20pesar%20del%20gobierno%C2%BB%3A%20Espa%C3%B1oles%20en%20el%20Per%C3%BA%2C%201879-1939&pg=PP1|title="A pesar del gobierno": españoles en el Perú, 1879-1939|author=Ascensión Martínez Riaza|year=2006|publisher=Editorial CSIC|page=139|isbn=84-00-08449-7}}</ref>

In the 1930s the great constructions began with the remodeling of the [[Government Palace, Peru|Government Palace of Peru]] and the [[Palacio Municipal de Lima|Palacio Municipal]]. These constructions reached their peak in the 1950s, during the government of [[Manuel A. Odría]], when the great buildings of the [[Ministry of Economy and Finance (Peru)|Ministry of Economy]] and the Ministry of Education were built ([[Javier Alzamora Valdez Building]], currently the seat of the [[Judicial District of Lima|Superior Court of Justice of Lima]]), the [[Ministry of Health (Peru)|Ministry of Health]], the [[Ministry of Labor and Promotion of Employment|Ministry of Labor]] and the Hospitals of the Workers' Insurance and of the Employee as well as the [[National Stadium of Peru|National Stadium]] and several large housing units.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xkx7eEGABl8C&dq=Las%20pol%C3%ADticas%20comerciales%20y%20cambiarias%20en%20el%20Per%C3%BA%2C%201960-1995&pg=PP1|title=Las políticas comerciales y cambiarias en el Perú, 1960-1995|author=Jorge Rojas|publisher=Fondo Editorial PUCP|year=1996|isbn=9972-42-060-4|page=55}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gob.pe/institucion/minedu/informes-publicaciones/1307863-historia-del-ministerio-de-educacion|website=[[Ministry of Education (Peru)]]|title=Historia del Ministerio de Educación}}</ref>

Also in those years a phenomenon began that changed the configuration of the city, which was the massive immigration of inhabitants from the interior of the country, producing the exponential growth of the capital's population and the consequent urban expansion.<ref name="Golte">{{cite web|url=https://www4.congreso.gob.pe/comisiones/1999/educacion/funcion/eventos/Expos16.html|title=La Migración Andina y la Cultura Peruana|author=Golte, Jürgen|website=Congress of the Republic of Peru|access-date=13 March 2022|archive-date=7 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230407101942/https://www4.congreso.gob.pe/comisiones/1999/educacion/funcion/eventos/Expos16.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> The new populations were settling on land near the center which was used as an agricultural area. The current districts of [[Lince District|Lince]], [[La Victoria District, Lima|La Victoria]] to the south were populated; [[Breña]] and [[Pueblo Libre District, Lima|Pueblo Libre]] to the west; [[El Agustino]], [[Ate District|Ate]] and [[San Juan de Lurigancho]] to the east and [[San Martín de Porres District|San Martín de Porres]] and [[Comas District, Lima|Comas]] to the north.
[[File:City of Lima, Peru.jpg|left|thumb|Lima in 2013]]

The urban area covers about {{convert|800|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. It is located on mostly flat terrain in the [[Sechura Desert|Peruvian coastal plain]], within the valleys of the [[Chillón River|Chillón]], [[Rímac River|Rímac]] and [[Lurín River|Lurín]] rivers. The city slopes gently from the shores of the Pacific Ocean into valleys and mountain slopes located as high as {{convert|1550|m|ft|sp=us}} above sea level. Within the city are isolated hills that are not connected to the surrounding hill chains, such as El Agustino, San Cosme, El Pino, La Milla, Muleria and Pro hills. The San Cristobal hill in the Rímac District, which lies directly north of the downtown area, is the local extreme of an Andean hill outgrowth.

While no official administrative definition for the city exists, it is usually considered to be composed of the central 30 of 43 districts of [[Lima Province]], corresponding to an urban area centered around the historic [[Lima District|Cercado de Lima]] district. The city is the core of the [[Lima Metropolitan Area|Lima Metro Area]], one of the ten [[List of metropolitan areas in the Americas|largest metro areas in the Americas]].

During winter, June through October, the weather is dramatically different. Grey skies, breezy conditions, higher humidity, and cooler temperatures prevail. Long 10 to 15-day stretches of dark overcast skies are not uncommon. Persistent morning drizzle ([[garúa]]) frequently occurs from June through September, coating the streets with a thin layer of water that generally dries up by early afternoon. Winter temperatures vary little between day and night. They range from lows of {{convert|14|to|16|°C|°F|abbr=on}} and highs of {{convert|16|to|19|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, rarely exceeding {{convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on}} except in the easternmost districts.<ref name="WMO">{{cite web |url=http://worldweather.wmo.int/029/c00108.htm |title=World Weather Information Service – Lima |publisher=World Meteorological Organization |access-date=15 May 2012 |archive-date=26 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181226040600/http://worldweather.wmo.int/029/c00108.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The predominantly onshore flow makes the Lima area one of the cloudiest among the entire Peruvian coast.

While relative humidity is high, rainfall is very low due to strong atmospheric stability. The severely low rainfall impacts the city's water supply, which originates from wells and from rivers that flow from the [[Andes]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Painter |first=James |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6412351.stm |title=Americas &#124; Peru's alarming water truth |work=BBC News |date=12 March 2007 |access-date=8 July 2009}}</ref> Inland districts receive anywhere between {{convert|10|and|60|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of rainfall per year, which accumulates mainly during the winter. Coastal districts receive only {{convert|10|to|30|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. As previously mentioned, winter precipitation occurs as persistent morning drizzle. These are locally called 'garúa', 'llovizna' or '[[camanchaca]]s'. On the other hand, summer rain is infrequent and occurs in the form of isolated light and brief showers. These generally occur during afternoons and evenings when leftovers from Andean storms arrive from the east. The lack of heavy rainfall arises from high atmospheric stability caused, in turn, by the combination of cool waters from semi-permanent coastal upwelling and the presence of the cold [[Humboldt Current]] and warm air aloft associated with the South Pacific anticyclone.

Lima's climate (like most of coastal Peru) gets severely disrupted in [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation|El Niño]] events. Coastal waters usually average around {{convert|17|–|19|°C|°F}}, but get much warmer (as in 1998 when the water reached {{convert|26|°C|°F|abbr=on}}). Air temperatures rise accordingly.

The first settlement in what would become Lima was made up of 117 housing blocks. In 1562, another district was built across the Rímac River and in 1610, the first stone bridge was built. Lima then had a population of around 26,000; blacks made up around 40% and whites made up around 38%.<ref>[http://www.lima.info/history.htm History of Lima].

During the early 20th century, thousands of immigrants came to the city, including people of European descent. They organized social clubs and built their own schools. Examples are [[Colegio Franklin Delano Roosevelt, The American School of Lima|The American-Peruvian school]], the [[Alliance française|Alianza Francesa de Lima]], the Lycée Franco-Péruvien and the hospital Maison de Sante; [[Markham College]], the British-Peruvian school in Monterrico, [[Antonio Raymondi District]] Italian School, the Pestalozzi Swiss School and also, several German-Peruvian schools.

Chinese and a lesser number of Japanese came to Lima and established themselves in the [[Barrios Altos]] neighborhood in downtown Lima. Lima residents refer to their [[Chinatown, Lima|Chinatown]] as ''Barrio chino'' or ''Calle Capon'' and the city's ubiquitous [[Chifa]] restaurants{{spaced ndash}}small, sit-down, usually Chinese-run restaurants serving the Peruvian spin on Chinese cuisine{{spaced ndash}}can be found by the dozens in this enclave.

In 2014, the National Institute for Statistics and Information (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica e Informatica) reported that the population in Lima's 49 districts was 9,752,000 people, including the Constitutional Province of Callao. The city and (metropolitan area) represents around 29% of the national population. Of the city's population 48.7% are men and 51.3% are women. The 49 districts in Metropolitan Lima are divided into 5 areas: Cono Norte (North Lima), Lima Este (East Lima), Constitutional Province of Callao, Lima Centro (Central Lima) and Lima Sur (South Lima). The largest areas are Lima Norte with 2,475,432 people and Lima Este with 2,619,814 people, including the largest single district San Juan de Lurigancho, which hosts 1&nbsp;million people.<ref name="inei.gob.pe" />

Lima is considered a "young" city. According to INEI, by mid 2014 the age distribution in Lima was: 24.3% between 0 and 14, 27.2% between 15 and 29, 22.5% between 30 and 44, 15.4% between 45 and 59 and 10.6% above 60.<ref name="inei.gob.pe"/>[[File:Cerro de San Cristóbal, Lima, Perú, 2015-07-28, DD 118.JPG|alt=|thumb|''[[Pueblos jóvenes]]'' on the outskirts of Lima in 2015. Today, many of them are consolidated.]]

Migration to Lima from the rest of Peru is substantial. In 2013, 3,480,000 people reported arriving from other regions. This represents almost 36% of the entire population of Metropolitan Lima. The three regions that supply most of the migrants are Junin, Ancash and Ayacucho. By contrast only 390,000 emigrated from Lima to other regions.<ref name="inei.gob.pe" />

The annual population growth rate is 1.57%. Some of the 43 metropolitan districts are considerably more populous than others. For example, San Juan de Lurigancho, San Martin de Porres, Ate, Comas, Villa El Salvador and Villa Maria del Triunfo host more than 400,000, while San Luis, San Isidro, Magdalena del Mar, Lince and Barranco have less than 60,000 residents.<ref name="inei.gob.pe"/>

A 2005 household survey study shows a socio-economic distribution for households in Lima. It used a monthly family income of 6,000 soles (around US$1,840) or more for socioeconomic level A; between 2,000 soles (US$612) and 6,000 soles (US$1,840) for level B; from 840 soles (US$257) to 2,000 soles (US$612) for level C; from 420 soles (US$128) to 1200 soles (US$368) for level D; and up to 840 soles (US$257) for level E. In Lima, 18% were in level E; 32.3% in level D; 31.7% in level C; 14.6% in level B; and 3.4% in level A. In this sense, 82% of the population lives in households that earn less than 2000 soles (or US$612) monthly. Other salient differences between socioeconomic levels include levels of higher education, car ownership and home size.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apeim.com.pe/wp-content/themes/apeim/docs/nse/APEIM-NSE-2003-2004-LIMA.pdf |title=Niveles socioeconómicos en Lima Metropolitana y Callao – APEIM |trans-title=Socioeconomic levels in Metropolitan Lima and Callao – APEIM |publisher=Asociación Peruana de Empresas de Investigación de Mercados |language=es |access-date=17 December 2014 |archive-date=10 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910065928/http://www.apeim.com.pe/wp-content/themes/apeim/docs/nse/APEIM-NSE-2003-2004-LIMA.pdf }}</ref>

In Metropolitan Lima in 2013, the percentage of the population living in households in poverty was 12.8%. The level of poverty is measured by households that are unable to access a basic food and other household goods and services, such as clothing, housing, education, transportation and health. The level of poverty has decreased from 2011 (15.6%) and 2012 (14.5%). Lima Sur is the area in Lima with the highest proportion of poverty (17.7%), followed by Lima Este (14.5%), Lima Norte (14.1%) and Lima Centro (6.2%). In addition 0.2% of the population lives in extreme poverty, meaning that they are unable to access a basic food basket.<ref name="inei.gob.pe"/>{{Panorama

As the main entry point to the country, Lima has developed an important tourism industry, among which its [[Historic Centre of Lima|Historic Center]], its archaeological centers, its nightlife, museums, art galleries, [[Festivities of Peru|festivities]] and popular traditions stand out. According to Mastercard's Global Destination Cities Index, in 2014, Lima was the most visited city of Latin America and was the 20th city globally, with 5.11 million visitors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newsroom.mastercard.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Mastercard_GDCI_2014_Letter_Final_70814.pdf|title=Master Card 2014 Global Destination Cities Index|author1=Yuwa Hedrick-Wong|author2=Desmond Choong|page=4|access-date=14 March 2022|archive-date=3 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803193028/https://newsroom.mastercard.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Mastercard_GDCI_2014_Letter_Final_70814.pdf}}</ref> In 2019,<ref>{{cite web |title=10 YEARS LATER: THE CITIES IN LATIN AMERICA & THE CARIBBEAN TAKING CROSS BORDER TRAVEL TO NEW LEVELS |url=https://newsroom.mastercard.com/latin-america/press-releases/10-years-later-the-cities-in-latin-america-the-caribbean-taking-cross-border-travel-to-new-levels/ |website=MasterCard Social Newsroom |access-date=25 March 2020 |archive-date=8 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220408145453/https://newsroom.mastercard.com/latin-america/press-releases/10-years-later-the-cities-in-latin-america-the-caribbean-taking-cross-border-travel-to-new-levels/ }}</ref> Lima is the top destination in South America, with 2.63&nbsp;million international visitors in 2018 and a growth forecast of 10.00% percent for 2019.

The [[Historic Centre of Lima]], which includes part of the districts of [[Lima District|Lima]] and [[Rímac District|Rímac]], was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1988 due to the importance that the city had during the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], leaving as testimony a large number of architectural legacies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/500|title=Historic Centre of Lima|website=UNESCO World Heritage Site}}</ref> Highlights include the [[Basilica and Convent of San Francisco, Lima|Basilica and Convent of San Francisco]], the [[Plaza Mayor de Lima|Plaza Mayor]], the [[Lima Metropolitan Cathedral]], the [[Basilica and Convent of Santo Domingo, Lima|Basilica and Convent of Santo Domingo]], the [[Palacio de Torre Tagle]], among others. The tour of the churches of the city is very popular among tourists. In a short walk through the city center we can find many, several of which date from the 16th and 17th centuries.

[[File:Convento Santo Domingo - Lima.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Basilica and Convent of Santo Domingo, Lima|Basilica of Santo Domingo]], built between 1678 and 1766. It holds the [[tomb]]s of the saints [[Rose of Lima]], [[Martín de Porres]] and [[John Macias]].<ref name="Guide to Peru"/>]]
Among them, the [[Lima Metropolitan Cathedral]] and the [[Basilica and Convent of San Francisco, Lima|Basilica of San Francisco]] stand out, which are said to be linked by the underground passageways of their catacombs. The [[Sanctuary and Monastery of Las Nazarenas]] also stands out, a place of pilgrimage to the ''[[Lord of Miracles|Señor de los Milagros]]'' (Lord of the Miracles), whose festivities in the month of October constitute the most important religious manifestation of Lima and of all Peruvians. Some sections of the [[Walls of Lima|Colonial Walls of Lima]] can still be seen: such is the case of the Bastion Santa Lucía, remains of the old Spanish fortification built by Viceroy [[Melchor de Navarra, Duke of Palata|Melchor de Navarra y Rocafull]] around the city center, whose location adjoins the limit of [[Barrios Altos]] and [[El Agustino]].

Likewise, having Lima the privilege of being the only capital in South America with immediate access to the sea, it has wide tourist piers that in recent years have become a great attraction for thousands of tourists, especially in the districts of Miraflores and Barranco, where there is also a wide development in terms of entertainment in these areas, turning the capital into a place with several places of tourism and entertainment.

Until the 1970s, the hotel offer was characterized by having the best hotels in the city in the [[Lima District|center of Lima]], however, since the early 1990s to date, these establishments have positioned themselves in other areas such as the central-southern area of the capital as in [[Miraflores District, Lima|Miraflores]], Barranco, [[Santiago de Surco]], [[Surquillo]] and [[San Borja District|San Borja]]; in addition to the [[San Isidro District, Lima|San Isidro district]] that has the largest hotel building in Peru, the 30-story Westin Libertador.

These fine examples of medieval Spanish fortifications were used to defend the city from attacks by [[pirate]]s and [[Privateer|corsairs]]. For this, part of the Walls corresponding to the rear area of the Basilica of San Francisco, very close to the [[Government Palace, Peru|Government Palace]], was recovered, in which a park was built (called Parque de la Muralla) and in which you can see remains of it.<ref>{{cite web|title=El Parque de la Muralla|url=http://www.perutoptours.com/index14limuralla.html|website=perutoptours.com}}</ref> Half an hour from the historic center, in the [[Miraflores District, Lima|district of Miraflores]] you can visit the tourist and entertainment center [[Larcomar]] which is located on the [[cliff]]s facing the sea.

The city has two traditional zoological parks: the main and oldest is the Parque de las Leyendas, located in the [[San Miguel District, Lima|San Miguel district]], and the other is the Parque Zoológico Huachipa located east of the city in the [[Lurigancho-Chosica]] district. On the other hand, the offer of [[Movie theater|cinema]]s is wide and has numerous state-of-the-art rooms (4D) that program international film premieres.

Exclusive beaches are visited during the summer months, which are located on the [[Pan-American Highway]], to the [[Cono Norte|north]] are the resorts of [[Santa Rosa District, Lima|Santa Rosa]] and [[Ancón District|Ancón]]; Until the 1980s, the latter was the most exclusive in Lima and Peru. Currently, although it maintains its architectural beauty, it is visited by people from all over [[Cono Norte|Lima North]] and the [[Lima District|Center]]. And to the [[Cono Sur (Lima)|south of the city]], the resorts of [[Punta Hermosa]], [[Punta Negra District|Punta Negra]], [[San Bartolo District|San Bartolo]] and [[Pucusana]]. Numerous restaurants, nightclubs, lounges, bars, clubs and hotels have been opened in such places to cater to bathers.

The suburban district of [[Cieneguilla]], the [[Pachacámac District|district of Pachacámac]] and the district of [[Chosica]] provide important tourist attractions among locals. Due to its elevation (over 500 masl), the sun shines in Chosica during the winter, being very visited by the residents of Lima to escape the urban fog.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geography.howstuffworks.com/south-america/geography-of-lima.htm|title=Geography of Lima|website=Geography.howstuffworks.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627163454/http://geography.howstuffworks.com/south-america/geography-of-lima.htm|archive-date=27 June 2008}}</ref>

==Society and culture==
Strongly influenced by [[Culture of Europe|European]], [[Andes|Andean]], [[Culture of Africa|African]] and [[Culture of Asia|Asian]] culture, Lima is a [[melting pot]], due to [[colonization]], immigration and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous influences]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Marmon |first=Johanna |title=Colonial masterpiece: many who visit Peru come for the journey to ancient Macchu Picchu.

===Architecture===
{{See also|Category:Buildings and structures in Lima|Category:Tourist attractions in Lima}}
The architecture of the capital is characterized by a mixture of styles as reflected in the changes between trends throughout various periods of the city's history. Examples of [[Spanish Colonial architecture|colonial architecture]] include structures such as the [[Basilica and Convent of San Francisco, Lima|Basilica and Convent of San Francisco]], the [[Lima Metropolitan Cathedral]], and the [[Palacio de Torre Tagle]]. These constructions were generally influenced by the styles of Spanish Neoclassicism, [[Spanish Baroque architecture|Spanish Baroque]], and the Spanish Colonial styles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dwell.com/article/lima-peru-4ee4f7d3|title=Lima, Peru{{!}}dwell.com|date=26 February 2009}}</ref>
[[File:Convento de San Francisco de Asís.jpg|thumb|Convento de San Francisco de Asís]]
In the buildings of the historic center you can see over 1,600 [[Balconies of Lima|balconies]] dating from the Viceroyalty and Republican times.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3eK1nVLHgMC&dq=V!VA%20Travel%20Guides%3A%20Peru&pg=PP1|title=V!VA Travel Guides: Peru|first1=Ricardo|last1=Segreda|first2=Crit|last2=Minster|first3=Paula|last3=Newton|publisher=Viva Publishing Network|year=2009|isbn=978-0-9791264-3-7|page=66}}</ref> The types of balconies that the city presents are open balconies, flat, box, continuous, among others. After the [[Independence of Peru]], a gradual shift towards [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] and [[Art Nouveau]] styles took place. Many of these constructions were influenced by the French architectural style.

[[File:Palacio de Torre Tagle.JPG|thumb|left|240px|[[Balconies of Lima|Balconies]] were a common colonial architectural feature in the historic center. In the image the [[Palacio de Torre Tagle]] completed in 1735.]]
In 1940, the census results reflected the city's major urban problems such as sanitation, housing, work, recreation and transportation. During the following years, the Society of Architects, the Institute of Urbanism, the Grupo Espacio, the magazine ''El Arquitecto Peruano'' and the Department of Architecture at the National School of Engineers were created. These entities tried to promote the improvement of urban conditions based on modern principles. Meanwhile, the State promoted the development of collective housing through organizations such as the National Housing Commission (CNV) and the National Office of Planning and Urban Development (ONPU). With the architect Fernando Belaunde as deputy, in 1945 the Housing Plan based on Neighborhood Units was made official.

Some government buildings as well as major cultural institutions were built in this architectural time period. During the 1950s and 1960s, several [[Brutalist style]] buildings were built on behalf of the [[Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces of Peru|military government]] of [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]]. Examples of this architecture are the [[Museo de la Nación]] and the [[Ministry of Defense (Peru)|Peruvian Ministry of Defense]]. The 20th century saw the appearance of glass [[skyscraper]]s, particularly around the [[San Isidro District, Lima|city's financial district]]. There are also several new architectural projects and real estate.

===Language===
Known as [[Peruvian Coast Spanish]], Lima's Spanish is characterized by the lack of strong intonations as found in many other Spanish-speaking regions. It is heavily influenced by [[Castile (historical region)|Castilian]] Spanish. Throughout the Viceroyalty era, most of the Spanish nobility based in Lima were originally from Castile.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?op=viewarticle&artid=113 |title=Articles: Colonial Lima according to Jorge Juan and Antonio de Ulloa |publisher=Historical Text Archive |access-date=8 July 2009}}</ref> Limean Castillian is also characterized by the lack of ''[[voseo]]'', unlike many other [[Spanish language in the Americas|Hispanic American]] countries. This is because ''voseo'' was primarily used by Spain's lower socioeconomic classes, a social group that did not begin to appear in Lima until the late colonial era.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Limean Spanish is distinguished by its clarity in comparison to other Latin American accents and has been influenced by immigrant groups including Italians, [[Andalusian people|Andalusians]], West Africans, Chinese and Japanese. It also has been influenced by [[anglicism]]s as a result of [[globalization]], as well as by Andean Spanish and [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]], due to migration from the Andean highlands.<ref>{{Cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=jayN0hV5DDkC |page=124}}|title=The Colonial Divide in Peruvian Narrative|via=Google Books|isbn=978-1-84519-184-9|author1=Kokotovic, Misha|year=2007|publisher=Sussex Academic Press }}</ref>

About 1.7 million residents are not connected to the drinking water system and are forced to buy water from tankers, even though it is not always safe to drink.

===Road===
{{Further|Highways in Peru}}
Lima is a major stop on the [[Pan-American Highway]]. Because of its location on the country's central coast, Lima is an important junction in Peru's highway system. Three major highways originate in Lima.
*The [[Peru Highway 1|Northern Panamerican Highway]] extends more than {{convert|1330|km|mi|sp=us}} to the border with Ecuador connecting the northern districts with many major cities along the northern Peruvian coast.
*The Central Highway ({{langx|es|Carretera Central|links=no}}) connects the eastern districts with cities in central Peru. The highway extends {{convert|860|km|mi|sp=us}} with its terminus at [[Pucallpa]] near Brazil.
*The [[Peru Highway 1|Southern Panamerican Highway]] connects the southern districts to the southern coast. The highway extends {{convert|1450|km|mi|sp=us}} to the border with Chile.

The city has a single major bus terminal next to the mall Plaza Norte. This bus station connects to national and international destinations. Other bus stations serve private bus companies around the city. In addition, informal bus stations are located in the south, center and north of the city.

===Maritime===
[[File:Miraflores Costa Verde Skyline (Lima, Peru).jpg|thumb|285x285px|Miraflores District on the coast]]
Lima's proximity to the port of [[Callao]] allows Callao to act as the metropolitan area's major port and one of Latin America's largest. Callao hosts nearly all maritime transport for the metropolitan area. A small port in [[Lurín District|Lurín]] serves oil tankers due to a nearby refinery. Maritime transport inside Lima city limits is relatively insignificant compared to that of Callao.

A new port is currently being constructed north of Lima in [[Chancay]]. The new port will become the largest in South America and is expected to be complete and commence operations in late 2024.

Lima operates a network of nine freeways – the Via Expresa Paseo de la Republica, Via Expresa Javier Prado, Via Expresa Grau, Panamericana Norte, Panamericana Sur, Carretera Central, Via Expresa Callao, Autopista Chillon Trapiche and the Autopista Ramiro Priale.<ref name="arqandina.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.arqandina.com/pages/p4/f413.htm |title=Periodo 1945–1965 – Galería de Fotos y Planos |publisher=Arqandina.com |access-date=8 July 2009 |archive-date=20 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220160606/http://arqandina.com/pages/p4/f413.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

According to a 2012 survey, the majority of the population uses public or collective transportation (75.6%), while 12.3% uses a car, taxi or motorcycle.<ref name="limacomovamos.org" />

The urban transport system is composed of over 300 transit routes<ref name="proinversion.gob.pe" /> that are served by buses, microbuses and combis.

Taxis are mostly informal and unmetered; they are cheap but feature poor driving habits. Fares are agreed upon before the passenger enters the taxi. Taxis vary in size from small four-door compacts to large vans. They account for a large part of the car stock. In many cases they are just a private car with a taxi sticker on the windshield. Additionally, several companies provide on-call taxi service.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/lima/2868020156.html |title=Lima: Planning a Trip: Getting Around |publisher=Frommers.com |date=28 July 2008 |access-date=8 July 2009}}</ref>

=== Corredores Complementarios Bus System ===
{{main|Corredores complementarios}}

The [[Integrated Transport System]] (SIT), is a bus system developed by the local government to reorganize the current system of routes that has become chaotic. One of the main goals of the SIT is to reduce the number of urban routes, renew the bus fleet currently operating by many private companies and to reduce (and eventually replace) most "combis" from the city.

As of July 2020, SIT currently operates 16 routes: [[San Martín de Porres District|San Martin de Porres]] – [[Santiago de Surco|Surco]] (107) [[Ate District|Ate]] – [[San Miguel District, Lima|San Miguel]] (201, 202,204,206 and 209), [[Rímac District|Rimac]] – [[Santiago de Surco|Surco]] (301,302,303 and 306), [[San Juan de Lurigancho]] – [[Magdalena del Mar District|Magdalena]] (404,405,409,412), and [[Lima District|Downtown Lima]] – [[San Miguel District, Lima|San Miguel]](508){{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

===Colectivos===
[[Colectivo]]s render express service on some major roads. The colectivos signal their specific destination with a sign on their windshield. Their routes are not generally publicitized but are understood by frequent users. The cost is generally higher than public transport; however, they cover greater distances at greater speeds due to the lack of stops. This service is informal and is illegal.<ref>{{cite web |title=Getting around: Taxis, mototaxis and colectivos |url=http://www.roughguides.com/travel/south-america/peru/getting-around/taxis-mototaxis-and-colectivos.aspx |work=[[Rough Guides]] |access-date=13 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116171248/http://www.roughguides.com/travel/south-america/peru/getting-around/taxis-mototaxis-and-colectivos.aspx |archive-date=16 January 2013}}</ref> Some people in the periphery use so-called "mototaxis" for short distances.

====Metropolitan Transport System====
[[File:Lima Metropoliano.jpg|thumb|[[El Metropolitano]]]]
The Metropolitan Transport System or [[El Metropolitano]] is a new, integrated system, consisting of a network of buses that run in exclusive corridors under the Bus Rapid Transit system (BRT). The goal is to reduce passengers' commute times, protect the environment, provide improved security and overall quality of service. Metropolitano was executed with funds from the City of Lima and financing from the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] and the [[World Bank]]. Metropolitana is the first BRT system to operate with natural gas, seeking to reduce air pollution.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metropolitano.gob.pe/|title=Metropolitano|website=www.metropolitano.gob.pe|access-date=7 April 2023}}</ref> This system links the principal points of the Lima Metropolitan Area. The first phase of this project has {{convert|33|km|sp=us}} of line (north) to [[Chorrillos District|Chorrillos]] (south). It began commercial operations on 28 July 2010. Since 2014, Lima Council operates the "Sistema Integrado de Transporte Urbano" (Urban integrated transport system), which comprises buses over [[Avenida Arequipa]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.munlima.gob.pe/corredorazul |title=Corredor Azul &#124; Tacna - Garcilaso de la Vega - Arequipa &#124; Reforma del Transporte |access-date=29 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729005141/http://www.munlima.gob.pe/corredorazul/ |archive-date=29 July 2014}}</ref> By the end of 2012, the Metropolitano system counted 244 buses in its central routes and 179 buses in its feeding routes. Weekday use averages 437,148 passengers. Usage increased since 2011 by 28.2% for weekdays, 29.1% for Saturdays and 33.3% for Sundays.<ref name="limacomovamos.org" />
[[File:Linea 1 del Metro de Lima.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Lima Metro]]]]

====Metro====
The [[Lima Metro]] is expected to have six lines. As of 2024, there are two lines running and a third under construction. The other lines are in the ministry of transportation investments portfolio for the next 5 years.

Line 1 has twenty six passenger stations, with an average separation of {{convert|1.2|km|ft|sigfig=2}}. It begins in the Industrial Park of Villa El Salvador, south of the city, continuing on to Av. Pachacútec in Villa María del Triunfo and then to Av. Los Héroes in San Juan de Miraflores. Afterwards, it continues through Av. Tomás Marsano in Surco to reach Ov. Los Cabitos, to Av. Aviación and then cross the river Rimac to finish, after almost {{convert|35|km|0|abbr=on}}, in the east of the capital in [[San Juan de Lurigancho]]. The system operates 24 trains, each with six wagons. Each wagon has the capacity to transport 233 people. The metro system began operating in December 2012 and transported 78,224 people on average on a daily basis.<ref name="limacomovamos.org" />

Line 2 of the metro has a first stage already working, the expansion of the line it's being delivered in 2026, along with a portion of line 4 that will be connecting the airport to the metro system. Line 3 and expansion of line 4 are now in the pre bid stage to be done in 2025.

===Other transportation issues===
[[File:Intensa Congestión vehicular en Lima.jpg|alt=avenue|thumb|271x271px|[[Traffic congestion|Traffic Jam]] in Javier Prado Avenue]]
Lima has high traffic congestion, especially at peak hours. 1.397 million vehicles were in use by the end of 2012. The region operates 65.3% of the cars in the country.<ref name="limacomovamos.org" />

The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) offered economic incentives for municipalities to implement bicycle routes in their districts. Recreational bike lanes can be found in 39 districts. The Proyecto Especial Metropolitano de Transporte No Motorizado (PEMTNM) estimates that more than a million and a half people used the bike lanes in 2012. The bike lanes ran for {{convert|71|km|0|abbr=on}}. They estimate that the use of the bike lanes prevented the emission of 526 tons of carbon dioxide in 2012.<ref name="limacomovamos.org" />

San Borja district was the first to implement a bike-share program called San Borja en Bici. It supplied 200 bicycles and six stations across the district (two of them connecting with the Metro). By December 2012, the program had 2,776 subscribers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.munisanborja.gob.pe/bicisanborja/ |title=:::.- San Borja en Bici -.::: |work=munisanborja.gob.pe |access-date=17 December 2014 |archive-date=1 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201045750/http://www.munisanborja.gob.pe/bicisanborja/ }}</ref>

==Challenges==
=== 'Wall of Shame' ===
In the 1980s, the [[internal conflict in Peru]] led part of the rural population (between 600,000 and 1 million people) to take refuge in Lima. The new arrivals, often very poor, erected hastily built shacks. Some residents of these shantytown neighborhoods have acquired property titles, but urban planning remains largely non-existent. The wealthy neighborhoods, in response, built their own walls (up to 3 meters high), complete with barbed wire at the top, to isolate themselves from these poorer populaces. The walls are now the subject of tension between those who support a security discourse and those who defend their perceived discriminatory behaviors, especially as many inhabitants of the poorer area cross the wall everyday to work in the neighbouring affluent areas, usually as gardeners or domestic workers.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Janetsky |first=Megan |date=2019-09-07 |title=Lima's 'Wall of Shame' and the Art of Building Barriers |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/09/peru-lima-wall/597085/ |access-date= |website=The Atlantic |language=en}}</ref>

===Environment===
[[File:Parapentes Miraflores Lima PE.jpg|thumb|Paragliding in Miraflores]]

====Air====
Lima suffers the most from air pollution. The microscopic sediment contained within engine exhaust and industrial emissions floats in the air for extended periods of time, either continuing as air pollution or eventually coming to settle as dust upon different urban surfaces. The fine particles are the most dangerous, as if inhaled, are able to damage the human [[respiratory system]]. The recommended limit of these particles by the [[World Health Organization]] is 5 tons/km2/month. In February 2014, Lima recorded an average of 15.2 tons/km2. The two districts with the highest concentration of sedimentary dust are El Agustino (46.1 tons/km2) and Independencia (25.5 tons/km2) in February 2014.<ref name="limacomovamos.org"/><ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web |url=http://www.inei.gob.pe/media/MenuRecursivo/boletines/estadisticas-ambientales-febrero-2014.pdf |title=Estadísticas Ambientales |date=February 2014 |website=inei.gob.pe }}{{Dead link|date=May 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Lima has built [[billboard]]s which serve as [[air purifier]]s.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://time.com/84013/this-billboard-sucks-pollution-from-the-sky-and-returns-purified-air/ |title=This Billboard Sucks Pollution from the Sky and Returns Purified Air |last=Peckham |first=Matt |date=1 May 2014 |magazine=Time |language=en |access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref>
[[File:Fiume Rimac.JPG|thumb|200x200px|Rimac river]]

====Water====
The permissible limit of lead in the water supply is 0.05 milligrams per liter, according to the Norm ITINTEC. In January 2014, the concentration of minerals in water treatment facilities of [[SEDAPAL]] was 0.051 iron, 0.005 lead, 0.0012 cadmium and 0.0810 aluminum. These values increased 15.9% and 33.3% in iron and cadmium with respect to January 2013 and a decrease of 16.7% and 12.4% in lead and aluminum. The values are within the recommended limits.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

====Solid waste====
The amount of solid waste produced per capita in Lima is about {{convert|0.7|kg|0|abbr=on}} per day. In 2012, each resident produced {{convert|273.36|kg|0|abbr=on}} of solid waste. The district municipalities only collect about 67% of the solid waste they generate. The rest ends up in informal landfills, rivers, or the ocean. Three municipalities recycle 20% or more of their waste.<ref name="inei.gob.pe"/>

'''COVID-19'''

Lima has a population of about 10 million people. This equates to one-third of the overall population of the nation. Lima was subjected to a lengthy period of confinement or quarantine that lasted more than four months. However, in May 2020, the process of restoring activities began as part of the national government's economic reactivation strategy.<ref name=":02">{{Cite web |title=Mayor of Lima sees COVID-19 as spark for an urban hub to the green recovery |url=https://www.eib.org/en/stories/urban-impact-of-covid-19 |access-date=2021-06-07 |website=European Investment Bank |language=en}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite magazine |title=Why Peru Is Emerging as a Coronavirus Hotspot in Latin America |url=https://time.com/5844768/peru-coronavirus/ |access-date=2021-06-07 |magazine=Time |language=en}}</ref>

Lima's [[green recovery]] is centred on bringing services closer to the most vulnerable people, with the goal of creating a green, wealthy, and equitable city for all. The municipality has an aim of implementing sustainable infrastructure to limit the development of [[COVID-19]] through the execution of 46&nbsp;km of rising bike routes.<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":3" />

Lima is one of over 10,000 cities from all around the world that make up the [[Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy|Global Covenant of Mayors.]]<ref name=":02" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=Home |url=https://www.globalcovenantofmayors.org/ |access-date=2021-06-07 |website=Global Covenant of Mayors |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Access to basic services===
In Lima, 93% of households have access to water supply in their homes. In addition, 92% of homes connect with sewage systems. 99.6% of homes have grid electric service. Although most households have water and sewage systems, some are available for only a few hours a day.<ref name="limacomovamos.org"/>

One and a half million inhabitants have no access to drinking water. The water problem mainly affects the outlying areas of the capital. The story of water in Lima is one of inequality. In the most affluent districts, per capita water consumption stands at 350 liters per day. In the poorest neighborhoods, it's between 20 and 70 liters a day.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-06-16 |title=Lima sin agua: Desigualdades sociales y amenazas ambientales en la capital |url=https://intercambio.pe/lima-agua-sociales/ |access-date= |website=INTERCAMBIO |language=es}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Vega |first=Renzo Gómez |date=2023-10-03 |title=Media Lima se quedará sin agua potable por un corte que durará hasta cuatro días |url=https://elpais.com/internacional/2023-10-03/media-lima-se-quedara-sin-agua-potable-por-un-corte-que-durara-hasta-cuatro-dias.html |access-date= |website=El País |language=es}}</ref>

===Security===
[[File:Lima from above.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|San Isidro, Lima from above]]
The perception of security varies by district. For example, San Isidro has the lowest perception of insecurity (21.4%), while Rimac has the highest perception of insecurity (85%), according to a 2012 survey. The five districts with the lowest perception of insecurity are San Isidro, San Borja, Miraflores, La Molina and Jesus Maria. The districts with the highest perception of insecurity are Rimac, San Juan de Miraflores, La Victoria, Comas and Ate.<ref name="ciudadnuestra.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.ciudadnuestra.org/segunda_encuesta_nacional_urbana_de_victimizacion_2012___peru.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606042705/http://ciudadnuestra.org/segunda_encuesta_nacional_urbana_de_victimizacion_2012___peru.html |archive-date=2013-06-06 |title=Ciudad Nuestra – Segunda Encuesta Nacional Urbana de Victimización 2012 Perú |website=ciudadnuestra.org |language=es}}</ref>

Overall, 40% of the population in Lima above 15 years old has been a crime victim. The younger population (ages 15 to 29 years old) has the highest victimization rate (47.9%).<ref name="inei.gob.pe"/> In 2012, citizens reported thefts (47.9%): in homes or establishments (19.4%), robbery or attack (14.9%), gang aggression (5.7%), among others in lesser frequency. The districts with the highest level of victimization are Rimac, El Agustino, Villa El Salvador, San Juan de Lurigancho and Los Olivos. The safest districts by level of victimization are Lurin, Lurigancho-Chosica, San Borja, Magdalena and Surquillo. These districts do not necessarily correspond to the districts with highest or lowest perception of insecurity.<ref name="ciudadnuestra.org"/>
[[File:Miraflores 2023.jpg|thumb|[[Miraflores District, Lima|Miraflores District]], among the safest areas of Lima]]
While the police force is nationally controlled and funded, each district in Lima has a community policing structure called Serenazgo. The quantity of Serenazgos officials and resources varies by district. For example, Villa Maria del Triunfo has 5,785 citizens per official. Twenty-two districts in Lima have a ratio above 1000 citizens per Serenazgo official, while 14 districts have ratios below 200 citizens per official, including Miraflores with 119 and San Isidro with 57.<ref name="inei.gob.pe"/>

The satisfaction with the Serenazgos also varies greatly by district. The highest satisfaction rates can be found in San Isidro (88.3%), Miraflores (81.6%), San Borja (77%) and Surco (75%). The lowest satisfaction rates can be found in Villa Maria del Triunfo (11%), San Juan de Miraflores (14.8%), Rimac (16.3%) and La Victoria (20%).<ref name="ciudadnuestra.org"/>
