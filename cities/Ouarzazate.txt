Films such as ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962), ''[[The Man Who Would Be King (film)|The Man Who Would Be King]]'' (1975), ''[[The Living Daylights]]'' (1987), ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' (1988), ''[[The Mummy (1999 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1999), ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' (2000), ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'' (2005), ''[[Kundun]]'' (1997), ''[[Legionnaire (film)|Legionnaire]]'' (1998), ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (2006 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' (2006), ''[[Salmon Fishing in the Yemen]]'' (2011) and ''[[The Wages of Fear]]'' (2024) were shot here, as was part of the TV series ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.
