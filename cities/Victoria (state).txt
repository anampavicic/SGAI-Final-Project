The state continued to grow strongly through various periods of the 20th and 21st centuries due to high levels of international and interstate migration. Melbourne hosts a number of museums, art galleries, and theatres; in 2016 a sports marketing company named it the world's sporting capital.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/melbourne-named-worlds-sporting-capital-20160420-gobebk.html|title=Melbourne named world's sporting capital|date=21 April 2016|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=22 July 2017|archive-date=11 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811174613/http://www.smh.com.au/sport/melbourne-named-worlds-sporting-capital-20160420-gobebk.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Victoria has 38 seats in the [[Australian House of Representatives]] and 12 seats in the [[Senate (Australia)|Australian Senate]]. At state level, the [[Parliament of Victoria]] consists of the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] and the [[Victorian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]]. The [[Australian Labor Party (Victorian Branch)|Labor Party]], led by [[Jacinta Allan]] as [[Premier of Victoria|premier]], has governed Victoria since 2014. The [[Governor of Victoria]], the representative of the [[Monarchy of Australia|monarch]] in the state, is currently [[Margaret Gardner]]. Victoria is divided into [[Local government areas of Victoria|79 local government areas]], as well as several [[unincorporated areas]] which the state administers directly.

During the Ice Age about 20,000 years [[Before Present|BP]], the area now the bay of [[Port Phillip]] would have been dry land, and the [[Yarra River|Yarra]] and [[Werribee River|Werribee rivers]] would have joined to flow through the heads then south and south west through the Bassian plain before meeting the ocean to the west.

It consisted of 402 people (five government officials, nine officers of marines, two drummers, and 39 privates, five soldiers' wives and a child, 307 convicts, 17 convicts' wives, and seven children).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4890461 |title=CORRESPONDENCE. |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=14 October 1901 |access-date=17 January 2012 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia |archive-date=14 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220514050503/https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/4890461 |url-status=live }}</ref> They had been sent from England in {{HMS|Calcutta|1795|6}} under the command of Captain [[Daniel Woodriff]], principally out of fear that the French, who had been exploring the area, might establish their own settlement and thereby challenge British rights to the continent.

==== Batman's treaty ====
Melbourne was founded in 1835 by [[John Batman]], who set up a base in [[Indented Head]], and [[John Pascoe Fawkner]]. From settlement, the region around Melbourne was known as the Port Phillip District, a separately administered part of New South Wales. Shortly after, the site now known as Geelong was surveyed by Assistant Surveyor W. H. Smythe, three weeks after Melbourne. And in 1838, [[Geelong]] was officially declared a town, despite earlier European settlements dating back to 1826. On 6 June 1835, just under two years before Melbourne was officially recognised as a settlement, John Batman, the leader of the [[Port Phillip Association]] presented [[Wurundjeri]] Elders with a land use agreement.

This document, now referred to as the [[Batman's Treaty|Batman treaty]], was later given to the British government to claim that local Aboriginal people had given Batman access to their land in exchange for goods and rations. The treaty itself was declared void as Batman did not have permission from the Crown to establish Melbourne. Today, the meaning and interpretation of this treaty is contested. Some argue it was a pretence for taking Aboriginal land in exchange for trinkets, while others argue it was significant in that it sought to recognise [[Aboriginal land rights]]. The exact location of the meeting between Batman and the Kulin men with whom he made the treaty is unknown, although it is believed to have been by the [[Merri Creek]]. According to historian Meyer Eidelson, it is generally believed to have occurred on the Merri near modern-day Rushall Station.<ref>{{cite web|title=Treaty – The Aboriginal History of Yarra|url=https://aboriginalhistoryofyarra.com.au/4-treaty/|access-date=6 August 2020|website=aboriginalhistoryofyarra.com.au|archive-date=10 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200810155721/https://aboriginalhistoryofyarra.com.au/4-treaty/|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 1 July 1851, writs were issued for the election of the first Victorian Legislative Council, and the absolute independence of Victoria from New South Wales was established proclaiming a new Colony of Victoria.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4097366 |title=Anniversary of the Week. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=4 July 1930 |access-date=26 January 2012 |page=2 Supplement: Saturday Camera Supplement |via=National Library of Australia |archive-date=14 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220514050506/https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/4097366 |url-status=live }}</ref> Days later, still in 1851 gold was discovered near [[Ballarat]], and subsequently at [[Bendigo]]. Later discoveries occurred at many sites across Victoria. This triggered one of the [[Victorian gold rush|largest gold rushes]] the world has ever seen. The colony grew rapidly in both population and economic power. In 10 years, the population of Victoria increased sevenfold from 76,000 to 540,000. All sorts of gold records were produced, including the "richest shallow alluvial goldfield in the world" and the [[Welcome Stranger|largest gold nugget]]. In the decade 1851–1860 Victoria produced 20 million ounces of gold, one-third of the world's output.<ref>{{cite web |title=Parliament of Victoria - About the First Legislative Council |url=https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/hansard/historical-hansard/about-the-first-legislative-council |access-date=7 August 2020 |publisher=parliament.vic.gov.au |archive-date=28 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728073320/https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/hansard/historical-hansard/about-the-first-legislative-council|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1854 at Ballarat, an armed rebellion against the government of Victoria was made by miners protesting against [[Miner's Licence|mining taxes]] (the "[[Eureka Stockade]]"). This was crushed by British troops, but the confrontation persuaded the colonial authorities to reform the administration of mining concessions (reducing the hated mining licence fees) and extend the [[Suffrage|electoral franchise]]. The following year, the Imperial Parliament granted Victoria responsible government with the passage of the Colony of Victoria Act 1855. Some of the leaders of the Eureka rebellion went on to become members of the Victorian Parliament.

In 1857, reflecting the growing presence of Irish Catholic immigrants, [[John O'Shanassy]] became the colony's second Premier with the former [[Young Ireland]]er, [[Charles Gavan Duffy]] as his deputy. Melbourne's Protestant establishment was ill-prepared "to countenance so startling a novelty".<ref>McCaughey, ''Victoria's Colonial Governors'', p. 75</ref> In 1858–59, ''Melbourne Punch'' cartoons linked Duffy and O'Shanassy to the terrors of the [[French Revolution]].<ref>''Punch'', 7 January 1859, p. 5</ref>

In 1862 Duffy's Land Act attempted, but failed, through a system of extended pastoral licences, to break the land-holding monopoly of the so-called [[Squatting (Australian history)|"squatter" class]].<ref>[http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/the-george-gavan-duffy-papers George Gavan Duffy papers] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217213627/http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/the-george-gavan-duffy-papers/ |date=17 December 2014 }}, historyireland.com. Retrieved 6 March 2016.</ref> In 1871, having led, on behalf of small farmers,  opposition to Premier [[James McCulloch|Sir James McCulloch]]'s [[land tax]], Duffy, himself, was briefly Premier.

In 1893 widespread bank failures brought to an end a sustained period of prosperity and of increasingly wild speculation in land and construction. Melbourne nonetheless retained, as the legacy of the gold rush, its status as Australia's primary financial centre and largest city. In 1901, Victoria became a state in the [[Commonwealth of Australia]]. While  [[Canberra]] was being built, Melbourne served until 1927 as the country's first federal capital.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ling |first1=Ted |title=Research Guide: Commonwealth Government records about Commonwealth Government records about the Australian Capital Territory |url=https://www.naa.gov.au/sites/default/files/2022-06/research-guide-government-records-about-ACT.pdf |website=National Archives of Australia |access-date=30 October 2022 |page=7}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Victoria|Geology of Victoria}}
Victoria's northern border follows a straight line from [[Cape Howe]] to the start of the [[Murray River]] and then follows the Murray River as the remainder of the northern border. On the Murray River, the border is the southern bank of the river. This precise definition was not established until 1980, when a ruling by [[Ninian Stephen|Justice Ninian Stephen]] of the [[High Court of Australia]] settled the question as to which state had jurisdiction in the unlawful death of a man on an island in the middle of the river. The ruling clarified that no part of the watercourse is in Victoria.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170202122432/http://www.smh.com.au/national/stateless-old-jack-beyond-all-borders-20120413-1wyvj.html "Stateless old Jack, beyond all borders", ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 14 April 2012].

Victoria contains many topographically, geologically and climatically diverse areas, ranging from the wet, [[temperate]] climate of [[Gippsland]] in the southeast to the snow-covered [[Victorian Alps|Victorian alpine areas]] which rise to almost {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with [[Mount Bogong]] the highest peak at {{convert|1986|m|ft|abbr=on}}. There are extensive semi-arid plains to the west and northwest. There is an extensive series of river systems in Victoria. Most notable is the [[Murray River]] system. Other rivers include: [[Ovens River]], [[Goulburn River, Victoria|Goulburn River]], [[Patterson River]], [[King River, Victoria|King River]], [[Campaspe River]], [[Loddon River]], [[Wimmera River]], Elgin River, [[Barwon River (Victoria)|Barwon River]], [[Thomson River, Victoria|Thomson River]], [[Snowy River]], [[Latrobe River]], [[Yarra River]], [[Maribyrnong River]], [[Mitta River]], [[Hopkins River]], [[Merri River]] and [[Kiewa River]].

According to [[Geoscience Australia]], the geographic centre of Victoria is located in [[Mandurang]] at 36° 51' 15"S, 144° 16' 52" E. The small rural locality is located 10&nbsp;km (6&nbsp;mi) south of [[Bendigo]]. Due to its central location and the region's historical ties to the gold rush, the town is widely regarded as the "Heart of Gold". The state's capital, Melbourne, contains about 70% of the state's population and dominates its economy, media, and culture. For other cities and towns, see [[list of localities (Victoria)]] and [[local government areas of Victoria]].

=== Regions ===
{{main|Regions of Victoria}}
[[File:Melbourne at night from the International Space Station.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Greater Melbourne]] at night from the [[International Space Station]]]]
Victoria is divided into distinct geographic [[region]]s, most commonly for the purposes of [[economic geography|economic development]], while others for [[land management]] (agriculture or conservation) and for [[census]]ing (statistical or meteorological) or electoral purposes. The most commonly used regions are those created by the state government for the purposes of [[economic geography|economic development]].

In addition to [[Melbourne|Greater Melbourne]], the [[Victoria State Government]] has divided Victoria into five regions covering all parts of the state. The five regional Victoria divisions are:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rdv.vic.gov.au/victorian-regions|title=Victorian Regions and Regional Cities|work=Regional Development Victoria|publisher=Victorian Government|date=|accessdate=10 August 2014}}</ref>

Victoria has a varied climate that ranges from semi-arid temperate with hot summers in the north-west, to temperate and cool along the coast. Victoria's main land feature, the Great Dividing Range, produces a cooler, mountain climate in the centre of the state. Winters along the coast of the state, particularly around [[Melbourne]], are relatively mild (''see chart'').

The coastal plain south of the Great Dividing Range has Victoria's mildest climate. Air from the [[Southern Ocean]] helps reduce the heat of summer and the cold of winter. Melbourne and other large cities are located in this temperate region.

[[The Mallee]] and upper [[Wimmera]] are Victoria's warmest regions with hot winds blowing from nearby semi-deserts. Average temperatures exceed {{convert|32|°C|0}} during summer and {{convert|15|C|F}} in winter. Except at cool mountain elevations, the inland monthly temperatures are {{convert|2|-|7|C-change|F-change|0}} warmer than around Melbourne (see chart). Victoria's highest maximum temperature of {{convert|48.8|C|F}} was recorded in [[Hopetoun, Victoria|Hopetoun]] on 7 February 2009, during the [[2009 southeastern Australia heat wave]].<ref name="weatherrecords">{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/extreme/records/national.pdf|title=Rainfall and Temperature Records: National|publisher=[[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]]|access-date=8 June 2018|archive-date=27 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327211715/http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/extreme/records/national.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Victorian Alps in the northeast are the coldest part of Victoria. The Alps are part of the Great Dividing Range mountain system extending east–west through the centre of Victoria. Average temperatures are less than {{convert|9|C|F|0}} in winter and below {{convert|0|C|F|0}} in the highest parts of the ranges. The state's lowest minimum temperature of {{convert|−11.7|°C|1}} was recorded at [[Omeo, Victoria|Omeo]] on 15 June 1965, and again at [[Falls Creek, Victoria|Falls Creek]] on 3 July 1970.<ref name="weatherrecords"/> Temperature extremes for the state are listed in the table below:

===Parliament===
{{Main|Parliament of Victoria|Victorian Legislative Assembly|Victorian Legislative Council}}

Victoria has a parliamentary form of government based on the [[Westminster System]]. Legislative power resides in the Parliament consisting of the Governor (the representative of the King), the executive (the Government), and two legislative chambers. The [[Parliament of Victoria]] consists of the lower house [[Victorian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]], the upper house [[Victorian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] and the [[Monarchy of Australia|monarch]]. Eighty-eight members of the Legislative Assembly are elected to four-year terms from single-member electorates.

In November 2006, the Victorian Legislative Council elections were held under a new multi-member proportional representation system. The State of Victoria was divided into eight electorates with each electorate represented by five representatives elected by [[Single Transferable Vote]]. The total number of upper house members was reduced from 44 to 40 and their term of office is now the same as the lower house members—four years. Elections for the Victorian Parliament are now fixed and occur in November every four years. Prior to the 2006 election, the Legislative Council consisted of 44 members elected to eight-year terms from 22 two-member electorates.

===Premier and cabinet===
The [[Premier of Victoria]] is the leader of the political party or coalition with the most seats in the Legislative Assembly. The Premier is the public face of government and, with cabinet, sets the legislative and political agenda. Cabinet consists of representatives elected to either house of parliament. It is responsible for managing areas of government that are not exclusively vested in the Commonwealth, by the [[Australian Constitution]], such as education, health and law enforcement. The current Premier of Victoria is [[Jacinta Allan]].

===Governor===
{{Main|Governor of Victoria}}
Executive authority is vested in the [[Governor of Victoria]] who represents and is appointed by the [[Monarchy of Australia|monarch]]. The post is usually filled by a retired prominent Victorian. The governor acts on the advice of the premier and cabinet. The current Governor of Victoria is [[Margaret Gardner]].

===Constitution===
{{main|Constitution of Victoria}}
Victoria has a written constitution enacted in 1975,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/ca1975188/ |title=Constitution Act 1975 |publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute |access-date=17 July 2016 |archive-date=25 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160525084614/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/ca1975188/ |url-status=live }}</ref> but based on the 1855 colonial constitution, passed by the United Kingdom Parliament as the ''Victoria Constitution Act 1855'', which establishes the Parliament as the state's law-making body for matters coming under state responsibility. The Victorian Constitution can be amended by the Parliament of Victoria, except for certain "entrenched" provisions that require either an absolute majority in both houses, a three-fifths majority in both houses, or the approval of the Victorian people in a referendum, depending on the provision. To this day, not a single referendum has been held to change the Victorian Constitution.

Labor has been in power since the [[2014 Victorian state election|November 2014 Victorian state election]].

The centre-left [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP), the centre-right [[Liberal Party of Australia]], the rural-based [[National Party of Australia]], and the left-wing environmentalist [[Australian Greens]] are Victoria's main political parties. Traditionally, Labor is strongest in Melbourne's working and middle class western, northern and inner-city suburbs, and the regional cities of [[Ballarat]], [[Bendigo]] and [[Geelong]]. The Liberals' main support lies in Melbourne's more affluent eastern suburbs and outer suburbs, and some rural and regional centres. The Nationals are strongest in Victoria's North Western and Eastern rural regional areas. The Greens, who won their first lower house seats in 2014, are strongest in inner Melbourne.

===Federal government===
Victorian voters elect 50 representatives to the [[Parliament of Australia]], including 38 members of the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and 12 members of the [[Australian Senate|Senate]]. Since 1 April 2023, the ALP hold 25 Victorian house seats, the Liberals 10, the Nationals three, the Greens one, and independents the remaining three. The ALP and the Liberals hold four senate seats each, while the Nationals, Greens, UAP and an independent hold one seat each.

Victoria is incorporated into 79 municipalities for the purposes of local government, including 39 shires, 32 cities, seven rural cities and one borough. Shire and city councils are responsible for functions delegated by the Victorian parliament, such as city planning, road infrastructure and waste management. Council revenue comes mostly from property taxes and government grants.<ref>Victorian Parliamentary Library, Department of Victorian Communities, Australian Electoral Commission</ref>

Victoria's [[Public school (government funded)|state school]] system dates back to 1872, when the colonial government legislated to make schooling both free and compulsory. The state's public secondary school system began in 1905. Before then, only private secondary schooling was available. Today, a Victorian school education consists of seven years of primary schooling (including one preparatory year) and six years of secondary schooling.

The final years of secondary school are optional for children aged over 17. Victorian children generally begin school at age five or six. On completing secondary school, students earn the [[Victorian Certificate of Education|Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE)]] or [[VCE Vocational Major|Victorian Certificate of Education - Vocational Major (VCE-VM)]]. Students who successfully complete their VCE (not including VCE-VM students) also receive an [[ATAR]], to determine university admittance (unless the student is [[Victorian Certificate of Education#Unscored VCE|'going unscored']].

Victorian schools are either publicly or privately funded. Public schools, also known as state or government schools, are funded and run directly by the [[Government of Victoria#Department of Education (DoE)|Victoria Department of Education]] [http://www.education.vic.gov.au/ Department of Education and Training Victoria]. Students do not pay tuition fees, but some extra costs are levied. Private fee-paying schools include parish schools run by the Roman Catholic Church and independent schools similar to British public schools. Independent schools are usually affiliated with Protestant churches. Victoria also has several private Jewish and Islamic primary and secondary schools. Private schools also receive some public funding. All schools must comply with government-set curriculum standards. In addition, Victoria has six government [[selective school]]s, [[Melbourne High School]] for boys, [[MacRobertson Girls' High School]] for girls, the coeducational schools [[John Monash Science School]], [[Nossal High School]] and [[Suzanne Cory High School]], and the [[Victorian College of the Arts Secondary School]]. Students at these schools are exclusively admitted on the basis of an academic selective entry test. Victoria also offers an online schooling system, called Virtual School Victoria, or VSV.

As of February 2019, Victoria had 1,529 public schools, 496 Catholic schools and 219 independent schools. Just under 631,500 students were enrolled in public schools, and just over 357,000 in private schools. Over 58 per cent of private students attend Catholic schools. More than 552,300 students were enrolled in primary schools and more than 418,600 in secondary schools. Retention rates for the final two years of secondary school were 84.3 per cent for public school students and 91.5 per cent for private school students. Victoria has about 46,523 full-time teachers.<ref name="statsnapshot">{{cite web |title=Snapshot: Victorian Schools Summary Statistics |url=https://www.education.vic.gov.au/Documents/about/department/summarystatssnapshot.pdf |publisher=Victorian Department of Education and Training |access-date=23 November 2019 |archive-date=19 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200519141031/https://www.education.vic.gov.au/Documents/about/department/summarystatssnapshot.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Tertiary education===

Victoria has [[List of universities in Australia#Victoria|nine universities]]. The first to offer degrees, the [[University of Melbourne]], enrolled its first student in 1855. The largest, [[Monash University]], has an enrolment of over 83,000 students—more than any other Australian university.<ref name="ucube">{{cite web |title=Higher Education Statistics |url=http://highereducationstatistics.education.gov.au |website=uCube |publisher=Department of Education and Training |access-date=20 November 2019 |archive-date=3 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220403065138/http://highereducationstatistics.education.gov.au/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The number of students enrolled in Victorian universities was 418,447 in 2018, an increase of 5.3% on the previous year. International students made up 40% of enrolments and account for the highest percentage of pre-paid university tuition fees.<ref name="ucube" /> The largest number of enrolments were recorded in the fields of business, administration and economics, with nearly 30% of all students, followed by arts, humanities, and social science, with 18% of enrolments.<ref name="ucube" />

Victoria has 12 government-run institutions of technical and further education ([[TAFE#Victoria|TAFE]]).<ref name="tafegov">{{cite web |title=TAFE governance |url=https://www.education.vic.gov.au/training/providers/rto/Pages/governance.aspx |publisher=Department of Education and Training |access-date=22 November 2019 |archive-date=22 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191122225633/https://www.education.vic.gov.au/training/providers/rto/Pages/governance.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref> The first vocational institution in the state was the Melbourne Mechanics' Institute (established in 1839), which is now the [[Athenaeum, Melbourne|Melbourne Athenaeum]]. More than 1,000 adult education organisations are registered to provide recognised TAFE programs. In 2014, there were 443,000 students enrolled in vocational education in the state. By 2018, the number of students in the sector had dropped by 40 per cent to 265,000—a five-year low which the education department attributed to withdrawal of funding to low-quality providers and a societal shift to university education.<ref name="tafereview">{{cite news |last1=Carey |first1=Adam |title=State puts training wheels in motion with vocational education review |url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/state-puts-training-wheels-in-motion-with-vocational-education-review-20191031-p536a3.html |access-date=22 November 2019 |work=The Age |date=31 October 2019 |language=en |archive-date=22 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191122225640/https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/state-puts-training-wheels-in-motion-with-vocational-education-review-20191031-p536a3.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Libraries===

The [[State Library Victoria]] is the State's research and reference library. It is responsible for collecting and preserving Victoria's documentary heritage and making it available through a range of services and programs. Material in the collection includes books, newspapers, magazines, journals, manuscripts, maps, pictures, objects, sound and video recordings and databases. The state has [[Public library|public libraries]] in most LGAs (typically with multiple branches in their respective municipal areas) and [[Academic library|academic libraries in universities]], and some [[List of libraries in Victoria#Special libraries|special libraries]].

===Manufacturing===

Victoria has a diverse range of manufacturing enterprises and Melbourne is considered Australia's most important industrial city. The post-World War II manufacturing boom was fuelled by international investment, attracted to the state by the availability of cheap land close to the city and inexpensive energy from the [[Latrobe Valley]]. Victoria produced 26.4% of total manufacturing output in Australia in 2015–16, behind New South Wales at 32.4%.

Machinery and equipment manufacturing is the state's most valuable manufacturing activity, followed by food and beverage products, petrochemicals and chemicals. Prominent manufacturing plants in the state include the [[Portland aluminium smelter|Portland]] and [[Point Henry smelter|Point Henry]] aluminium smelters, owned by [[Alcoa World Alumina & Chemicals|Alcoa]]; [[Geelong Oil Refinery|Geelong]] and [[Altona Refinery|Altona]] oil refineries; a major petrochemical facility at [[Laverton, Victoria|Laverton]]; and Victorian-based [[CSL Limited|CSL]], a global biotechnology company that produces vaccines and plasma products, among others. Victoria also plays an important role in providing goods for the [[Defence industry of Victoria|defence industry]].

Victoria proportionally relies on manufacturing more than any other state in Australia, constituting 8.6% of total state product; slightly higher than South Australia at 8.0%. However, this proportion has been declining for three decades; in 1990 at the time of the [[Early 1990s recession in Australia|early 1990s recession]] manufacturing constituted 20.3% of total state output. Manufacturing output peaked in absolute terms in 2008, reaching $28.8&nbsp;billion and has slowly fallen over the decade to $26.8&nbsp;billion in 2016 (−0.77% per annum). Since 1990, manufacturing employment has also fallen in both aggregate (367,700 to 274,400 workers) and proportional (17.8% to 9.0%) terms. The strong Australian dollar as a result of the [[Mining in Australia|2000s mining boom]], small population and isolation, high wage base and the general shift of manufacturing production towards developing countries have been cited as some of the reasons for this decline.

Historically, Victoria has been a hub for the manufacturing plants of the major car brands [[Ford Australia|Ford]], [[Toyota Australia|Toyota]] and [[Holden]]; however, closure announcements by all three companies in the 2010s has meant Australia will completely lose their car manufacturing industry by the end of 2017. Holden's announcement occurred in May 2013 following Ford's decision in December the previous year (Ford's Victorian plants, in [[Broadmeadows]] and [[Geelong]], closed in October 2016).<ref>{{cite news|title=South Australia stunned as GM announces Holden's closure in Adelaide in 2017|url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/holden-announces-it-will-stop-producing-cars-in-australia-leading-to-the-loss-of-2900-jobs/story-fnda1bsz-1226780247370|access-date=12 February 2014|newspaper=News.com.au|date=12 December 2013|archive-date=9 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209160149/http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/holden-announces-it-will-stop-producing-cars-in-australia-leading-to-the-loss-of-2900-jobs/story-fnda1bsz-1226780247370|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Ford closure sends shockwave through manufacturing industry|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-05-23/ford-closure-sends-shockwave-through-manufacturing-industry/4708584|access-date=12 February 2014|newspaper=ABC News|date=24 May 2013|archive-date=6 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140206215710/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-05-23/ford-closure-sends-shockwave-through-manufacturing-industry/4708584|url-status=live}}</ref> Toyota followed suit in February 2014 with an expected announcement as without Holden or Ford, local supply chains would struggle to create the [[economics of scale]] required to supply one manufacturer.<ref>{{cite news|title=Toyota to stop making cars in Australia, follows Ford and Holden|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/news/toyota-to-stop-making-cars-in-australia-follows-ford-and-holden/news-story/c446dddef6098aed1361d200040bc1c6|newspaper=The Australian|date=10 February 2014|access-date=25 August 2017|archive-date=23 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823043114/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/news/toyota-to-stop-making-cars-in-australia-follows-ford-and-holden/news-story/c446dddef6098aed1361d200040bc1c6|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Land===
Victoria adopted the [[Torrens title|Torrens system]] of land registration with the ''Real Property Act 1862''.<ref>{{cite Legislation AU|Vic|hist_act|rpa178|Real Property Act 1862}}</ref> The Torrens system did not replace the common law system but applied only to new land grants and to land that has been voluntarily registered under the Act, and its successors. The common law system continues to apply to all other private landholdings. [[Crown land#Australia|Crown land]] held in Victoria is managed under the ''Crown Land (Reserves) Act 1978'' and the ''Land Act 1958''.

===Mining===

[[File:Yallourn-w-power-station-australia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|[[Yallourn Power Station]] in the Latrobe Valley]]
{{See also|Energy in Victoria}}
Mining in Victoria contributes around A$6&nbsp;billion to the gross state product (~2%) but employs less than 1% of workers. The Victorian mining industry is concentrated on energy producing minerals, with [[brown coal]], petroleum and [[natural gas|gas]] accounting for nearly 90% of local production. The oil and gas industries are centred off the coast of [[Gippsland]] in the state's east, while brown coal mining and power generation is based in the [[Latrobe Valley]].

In 1985, oil production from the offshore Gippsland Basin peaked to an annual average of {{convert|450000|oilbbl|m3}} per day. In 2005–2006, the average daily oil production has declined to {{convert|83000|oilbbl|m3|abbr=on}}/d, but despite the decline Victoria still produces almost 19.5% of crude oil in Australia.<ref name="macrabbit" /> In the 2005–06 fiscal year, the average gas production was over {{convert|700|Mcuft|m3}} per day (M cuft/d) and represented 18% of the total national gas sales, with demand growing at 2% per year.<ref name="macrabbit">{{cite web |url=http://www.dpi.vic.gov.au/DPI/nrenmp.nsf/childdocs/-56D4D5E9AEF563E84A256A800011E5D6?open |website=Department of Primary Industries |title=Oil and Gas |access-date=22 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719055505/http://www.dpi.vic.gov.au/DPI/nrenmp.nsf/childdocs/-56D4D5E9AEF563E84A256A800011E5D6?open |archive-date=19 July 2008 }}</ref>  Campaigning resulted in a prohibition on onshore gas exploration and production in Victoria in 2014,.

Victoria has the highest population density in any state in Australia, with population centres spread out over most of the state; only the far northwest and the [[Victorian Alps]] lack permanent settlement. As of October 2013, smoking tobacco is prohibited in the sheltered areas of train stations, and tram and bus stops, as is the use of e-cigarettes. Between 2012 and 2013, 2002 people were issued with infringement notices. The state government announced a plan in October 2013 to prohibit smoking on all Victorian railway station platforms and raised tram stops.<ref>{{cite news |date=13 October 2013 |title=Vic transport smoking bans to be extended |url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/vic-transport-smoking-bans-to-be-extended/news-story/2e2ce010cbe2200930c375fbd40b4261 |access-date=2024-01-12 |newspaper=The Australian |agency=Australian Associated Press}}</ref>

The [[Road transport in Victoria|Victorian road network]] services the population centres, with highways generally radiating from Melbourne and other major cities and rural centres with secondary roads interconnecting the highways to each other. Many of the highways are built to freeway standard ("M"&nbsp;freeways), while most are generally sealed and of reasonable quality.
[[File:VL81 Ballarat Station.jpg|thumb|A [[V/Line]] VLocity diesel train at [[Ballarat railway station|Ballarat station]]]]
[[Rail transport in Victoria]] is provided by several private and public railway operators who operate over government-owned lines. Major operators include: [[Metro Trains Melbourne]] which runs an extensive, electrified, passenger system throughout Melbourne and suburbs; [[V/Line]] which is now owned by the Victorian Government, operates a concentrated service to major regional centres, as well as long-distance services on other lines; [[Pacific National]], [[CFCL Australia]] which operate freight services; [[Great Southern Rail (Australia)|Great Southern Rail]] which operates ''[[The Overland]]'' Melbourne—Adelaide; and [[NSW TrainLink]] which operates [[New South Wales XPT|XPTs]] Melbourne—Sydney.

There are also several smaller freight operators and numerous tourist railways operating over lines which were once parts of a state-owned system. Victorian lines mainly use the {{convert|5|ft|3|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} [[Victorian broad gauge|broad gauge]]. However, the interstate trunk routes, as well as a number of freight lines in the north and west of the state have been converted to {{convert|4|ft|8+1/2|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} [[standard gauge]]. Two tourist railways operate over {{convert|2|ft|6|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} [[Narrow gauge lines of the Victorian Railways|narrow gauge]] lines, which are the remnants of five formerly government-owned lines which were built in mountainous areas.

==Utilities==

===Energy===

Victoria's major utilities include a collection of brown-coal-fired power stations, particularly in the Latrobe Valley. One of these was the recently decommissioned [[Hazelwood Power Station]], which was number&nbsp;1 on the worldwide [[List of least carbon efficient power stations]]. The Victorian government is aiming to cut 40.6 megatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions by 2025.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.esc.vic.gov.au/victorian-energy-upgrades/about-victorian-energy-upgrades-program|title=About the Victorian Energy Upgrades program|website=Essential Services Commission|access-date=23 January 2020|archive-date=4 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200204083646/https://www.esc.vic.gov.au/victorian-energy-upgrades/about-victorian-energy-upgrades-program|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ecofinsolution.com.au/victorian-energy-upgrades/|title=Victorian Energy Upgrades (VEU) Program|website=Ecofin Solutions|access-date=23 January 2020|archive-date=27 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200127101735/https://www.ecofinsolution.com.au/victorian-energy-upgrades|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Water===
{{see also|Water management in Victoria}}

Victoria's water infrastructure includes a series of dams and reservoirs, predominantly in Central Victoria, that hold and collect water for much of the state. The water collected is of a very high quality and requires little chlorination treatment, giving the water a taste more like water collected in a rainwater tank. In regional areas however, such as in the west of the state, chlorination levels are much higher. The Victorian Water Grid consists of a number of new connections and pipelines being built across the State. This allows water to be moved around Victoria to where it is needed most and reduces the impact of localised droughts in an era thought to be influenced by climate change. Major projects already completed as part of the Grid include the Wimmera Mallee Pipeline and the Goldfields Superpipe.<ref>"Department of Sustainability & Environment, "Expansion of the Water Grid", {{cite web |url=http://www.ourwater.vic.gov.au/programs/water-grid |title=Our Water, Our Future – Expansion of the Water Grid |access-date=27 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219123539/http://www.ourwater.vic.gov.au/programs/water-grid |archive-date=19 February 2011  }}.
