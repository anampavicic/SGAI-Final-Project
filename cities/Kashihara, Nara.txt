{{nihongo|'''Kashihara'''|橿原市|Kashihara-shi}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] located in [[Nara Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. {{As of|2015|4|1|df=US}}, the city has an estimated [[population]] of 124,829, with 52,034 households.<ref name="Nara150401">{{cite web |url=http://www.pref.nara.jp/secure/114166/jinkou27-4.xls |title=市町村別推計人口・世帯数 |work=[[Nara Prefecture]] |language=ja |date=April 1, 2015 |access-date=May 5, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518074315/http://www.pref.nara.jp/secure/114166/jinkou27-4.xls |archive-date=May 18, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> 

The city was founded on February 11, 1956. The former mayor was Yutaka Asoda, who was elected to his third term of office in 2003. The present mayor is Yutaka Morishita, who was elected in 2007.

The exact spot of [[Emperor Jimmu]]'s accession to the imperial throne (i.e. the foundation of Japan) was debated for centuries until in 1863 scholars of [[Kokugaku|national studies]] claimed to have identified an area within Kashihara as the exact location. The city was the location of the Imperial capital [[Fujiwara-kyō]], from 694 to 710.

In the late 16th century it was said to be one of the two richest [[Autonomous city|autonomous cities]] of Japan, as in ''Umi no Sakai, Riku no Imai'' (tr. "by the sea, [[Sakai]] – inland, Imai" - Imai or [[:ja:今井町]] is now a part of Kashihara).

On 8 July 2022, after former Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinzo Abe]] was [[Assassination of Shinzo Abe|shot]] while campaigning in Nara City, he was taken to Nara Medical University Hospital in Kashihara for treatment, but died there.<ref>{{cite web |date=8 July 2022 |title=Man taken into custody after former Japanese PM Abe Shinzo collapses &#124; NHK WORLD-JAPAN News |url=https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20220708_19/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220708032135/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20220708_19/ |archive-date=8 July 2022 |access-date=8 July 2022}}</ref>
