It is situated in the [[North Caucasus]] of [[Eastern Europe]], between the [[Caspian Sea]] and [[Black Sea]]. The republic forms a part of the [[North Caucasian Federal District]], and shares land borders with [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to its south; with the Russian republics of [[Dagestan]], [[Ingushetia]], and [[North Ossetia–Alania]] to its east, north, and west; and with [[Stavropol Krai]] to its northwest.


After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the [[Chechnya and Ingushetia in the Soviet Union|Checheno-Ingush ASSR]] split into two parts: the Republic of [[Ingushetia]] and the Chechen Republic. The latter proclaimed the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]], which declared independence, while the former sided with Russia.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Publications |first1=Europa |title=The Territories of the Russian Federation 2012 |date=21 August 2012 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-09584-0 |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wOVjhOAfn_kC |language=en}}</ref>  Following the [[First Chechen War]] of 1994–1996 with Russia, Chechnya gained ''[[de facto]]'' independence as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, although ''[[de jure]]'' it remained a part of Russia. Russian federal control was restored in the [[Second Chechen War]] of 1999–2009, with Chechen politics being dominated by the former Ichkerian [[Mufti]] [[Akhmad Kadyrov]], and later his son [[Ramzan Kadyrov]].

{{Main|History of Chechnya}}

===Origin of Chechnya's population===
{{Main|Vainakh origin hypotheses}}

According to [[Leonti Mroveli]], the 11th-century [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] chronicler, the word Caucasian is derived from the [[Nakh peoples|Nakh]] ancestor [[Caucas|Kavkas]].<ref>The work of Leonti Mroveli: "The history of the Georgian Kings" dealing with the history of Georgia and the Caucasus since ancient times to the 5th century AD, is included in medieval code of Georgian annals "Kartlis Tskhovreba".</ref>
According to George Anchabadze of [[Ilia State University]]:

{{blockquote|The Vainakhs are the ancient natives of the [[Caucasus]]. It is noteworthy, that according to the genealogical table drawn up by Leonti Mroveli, the legendary forefather of the Vainakhs was "Kavkas", hence the name Kavkasians, one of the ethnicons met in the ancient Georgian written sources, signifying the ancestors of the [[Chechens]] and [[Ingush people|Ingush]]. As appears from the above, the Vainakhs, at least by name, are presented as the most "Caucasian" people of all the Caucasians (Caucasus – Kavkas – Kavkasians) in the Georgian historical tradition.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://eng.kavkaz-uzel.eu/articles/1887/ |work=Caucasian Knot |title=An Essay on the History of the Vainakh People.

American linguist [[Johanna Nichols]] "has used language to connect the modern people of the Caucasus region to the ancient farmers of the [[Fertile Crescent]]" and her research suggests that "farmers of the region were proto-Nakh-Daghestanians". Nichols stated: "The [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Nakh–Dagestanian languages]] are the closest thing we have to a direct continuation of the cultural and linguistic community that gave rise to [[Western civilisation]]."<ref name="science">{{cite journal |url=https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.288.5469.1158?sid=b73d602d-8965-4c4a-90ba-26a04c20dab7 |title=Peering into the Past, With Words|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date=19 May 2000|volume=288|issue=5469|pages=1158|last1=Wuethrich|first1=Bernice|doi=10.1126/science.288.5469.1158|s2cid=82205296}}</ref>

===Prehistory===
[[File:Karte des Kaukasischen Isthmus - Entworfen und gezeichnet von J-Grassl - 1856.jpg|thumb|Map of the Caucasian [[isthmus]] by J. Grassl, 1856]]

Traces of human settlement dating back to 40,000 BC were found near [[Lake Kezanoi]]. Cave paintings, artifacts, and other archaeological evidence indicate continuous habitation for some 8,000 years.<ref name="chechhand" /> People living in these settlements used tools, fire, and clothing made of animal skins.<ref name="chechhand">{{Cite book |last=Jaimoukha |first=Amjad M. |title=The Chechens: a handbook |publisher=Routledge |date=1 March 2005 |edition=1st |page=110 |isbn=978-0-415-32328-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PnjAlei9fe0C&q=Deela-Malkh&pg=PA110 |access-date=14 August 2009}}</ref>

The [[Caucasian Epipaleolithic]] and early [[Caucasian Neolithic]] era saw the introduction of [[agriculture]], [[irrigation]], and the domestication of animals in the region.<ref name="science"/> Settlements near Ali-Yurt and [[Magas]], discovered in modern times, revealed tools made out of stone: stone axes, polished stones, stone knives, stones with holes drilled in them, clay dishes etc. Settlements made out of clay bricks were discovered in the plains. In the mountains there were settlements made from stone and surrounded by walls; some of them dated back to 8000 BC.<ref name="Kodzoev">{{cite book |author=N. D. Kodzoev |title=History of Ingush nation}}</ref>{{full citation needed|date=May 2023}} This period also saw the appearance of the wheel (3000 BC), horseback riding, metal works (copper, gold, silver, iron), dishes, armor, daggers, knives and arrow tips in the region. The artifacts were found near [[Nasare-Cort]], [[Muzhichi]], Ja-E-Bortz (alternatively known as [[Surkha-khi]]), Abbey-Gove (also known as [[Nazran]] or Nasare).<ref name="Kodzoev" />

===Pre-imperial era===
In the 14th and 15th centuries, there was frequent warfare between the Chechens, [[Tamerlane]] and [[Tokhtamysh]], culminating in the [[Battle of the Terek River]] (see [[Tokhtamysh–Timur war]]). The Chechen tribes built fortresses, castles, and defensive walls, protecting the mountains from the invaders (see [[Vainakh tower architecture]]). Part of the lowland tribes were occupied by Mongols. However, during the mid-14th century a strong Chechen Princedom called [[Princedom of Simsim|Simsim]] emerged under [[Khour II]], a Chechen king that led the Chechen politics and wars. He was in charge of an army of Chechens against the rogue warlord [[Mamai]] and defeated him in the Battle of Tatar-tup in 1362. The kingdom of Simsim was almost destroyed during the Timurid invasion of the Caucasus, when Khour II allied himself with the [[Golden Horde]] Khan Tokhtamysh in the Battle of the Terek River. Timur sought to punish the highlanders for their allegiance to Tokhtamysh and as a consequence invaded Simsim in 1395.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tesaev|first=Amin|date=2018|title=Симсим|journal=Рефлексия|volume=2|pages=61–67}}</ref>

The 16th century saw the first Russian involvement in the Caucasus. In 1558, Temryuk of Kabarda sent his emissaries to Moscow requesting help from [[Ivan the Terrible]] against the Vainakh tribes. Ivan the Terrible married Temryuk's daughter [[Maria Temryukovna]]. An alliance was formed to gain the ground in the central Caucasus for the expanding [[Tsardom of Russia]] against stubborn Vainakh defenders.

In 1667 Mehk-Da [[Aldaman Gheza]] defended the borders of Chechnya from invasions of [[Kabardinians]] and [[Caucasian Avars|Avars]] during the [[Battle of Khachara]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://proza.ru/2019/12/30/99|title=Предводитель Гази Алдамов, или Алдаман ГIеза (Амин Тесаев) / Проза.ру|website=proza.ru}}</ref> The Chechens converted over the next few centuries to [[Sunni Islam]], as Islam was associated with resistance to Russian encroachment.<ref name="tsaroieva">{{cite book |last=Tsaroïeva |first=Mariel |title=Anciennes croyances des Ingouches et des Tchétchènes: peuples du Caucase du Nord |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J1qtAWyeYOEC |year=2005 |publisher=Maisonneuve et Larose |location=Paris |language=fr |isbn=978-2-7068-1792-2}}</ref><ref name="ilyasov">{{cite book |last=Ilyasov |first=Lecha |title=The Diversity of the Chechen Culture: From Historical Roots to the Present |year=2009 |publisher=UNESCO Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |author2=Ziya Bazhayev Charity Foundation |isbn=978-5-904549-02-2 |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001860/186004E.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705125530/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001860/186004e.pdf |archive-date=2010-07-05 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Peter the Great]] first sought to increase Russia's political influence in the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Caspian Sea]] at the expense of [[Safavid Persia]] when he launched the [[Russo-Persian War (1722–1723)|Russo-Persian War of 1722–1723]]. Russian forces succeeded in taking much of the Caucasian territories from Iran for several years.<ref name="books.google.nl">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGj4B1rdcu0C&q=russo+persian+war+1722+vainakh&pg=PA53 |title=The Insurgency in Chechnya and the North Caucasus: From Gazavat to Jihad |access-date=25 December 2014|isbn=9780313386343 |last1=Schaefer |first1=Robert W. |year=2010 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic }}</ref>

As the Russians took control of the Caspian corridor and moved into Persian-ruled [[Dagestan]], Peter's forces ran into mountain tribes. Peter sent a cavalry force to subdue them, but the Chechens routed them.<ref name="books.google.nl" /> In 1732, after Russia had already ceded back most of the Caucasus to Persia, now led by [[Nader Shah]], following the [[Treaty of Resht]], Russian troops clashed again with Chechens in a village called Chechen-aul along the [[Argun River (Caucasus)|Argun River]].<ref name="books.google.nl" /> The Russians were defeated again and withdrew, but this battle is responsible for the apocryphal story about how the Nokchi came to be known as "Chechens" – the people ostensibly named for the place the battle had taken place. The name "Chechen" was however already used from as early as 1692.<ref name="books.google.nl" />

Under intermittent Persian rule since 1555, in 1783 the eastern Georgians of [[Kartl-Kakheti]] led by [[Erekle II]] and Russia signed the [[Treaty of Georgievsk]]. According to this treaty, Kartl-Kakheti received protection from Russia, and Georgia abjured any dependence on [[Qajar dynasty|Iran]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dUHhTPdJ6yIC&q=agha+mohammad+khan+conquer+georgia&pg=PT273 |title=Iran at War: 1500–1988 |access-date=25 December 2014 |isbn=9781780962214 |last1=Farrokh |first1=Kaveh |date=20 December 2011 |publisher=Osprey Publishing Limited }}{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> In order to increase its influence in the Caucasus and to secure communications with Kartli and other Christian regions of the Transcaucasia which it considered useful in its wars against Persia and Turkey, the Russian Empire began conquering the Northern Caucasus mountains. The Russian Empire used Christianity to justify its conquests, allowing Islam to spread widely because it positioned itself as the religion of liberation from tsardom, which viewed Nakh tribes as "bandits".<ref name="ling" /> The rebellion was led by [[Mansur Ushurma]], a Chechen [[Naqshbandi]] ([[Sufi]]) sheikh—with wavering military support from other North Caucasian tribes. Mansur hoped to establish a [[Transcaucasus]] Islamic state under [[sharia]] law. He was unable to fully achieve this because in the course of the war he was betrayed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], handed over to Russians, and executed in 1794.<ref>John Frederick Baddeley, ''The Russian Conquest of the Caucasus'', London, Curzon Press, 1999, p. 49.</ref>

Following the forced ceding of the current territories of Dagestan, most of [[Azerbaijan]], and Georgia by Persia to Russia, following the [[Russo-Persian War (1804–1813)|Russo-Persian War of 1804–1813]] and its resultant [[Treaty of Gulistan]], Russia significantly widened its foothold in the Caucasus at the expense of Persia.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey63iJcVvbMC&q=treaty+of+gulistan+azerbaijan+dagestan&pg=PA56 |title=Russian Imperialism: Development and Crisis |access-date=25 December 2014|isbn=9780275964818 |last1=Cohen |first1=Ariel |year=1998 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic }}</ref> [[Russo-Persian War (1826–1828)|Another successful Caucasus war]] against Persia several years later, starting in 1826 and ending in 1828 with the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]], and a [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|successful war]] against Ottoman Turkey in 1828 and 1829, enabled Russia to use a much larger portion of its army in subduing the natives of the [[North Caucasus]].

The resistance of the Nakh tribes never ended and was a fertile ground for a new Muslim-[[Caucasian Avars|Avar]] commander, [[Imam Shamil]], who fought against the Russians from 1834 to 1859 (see [[Murid War]]). In 1859, Shamil was captured by Russians at aul Gunib. Shamil left [[Baysangur of Benoa]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO--iigYIes | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211124/tO--iigYIes| archive-date=24 November 2021 | url-status=live|title=Человек из камня Байсангур Беноевский |via=YouTube |date=10 December 2010 |access-date=14 March 2014}}{{cbignore}}</ref> a Chechen with one arm, one eye, and one leg, in charge of command at Gunib. Baysangur broke through the siege and continued to fight Russia for another two years until he was captured and killed by Russians. The Russian tsar hoped that by sparing the life of Shamil, the resistance in the North Caucasus would stop, but it did not. Russia began to use a colonization tactic by destroying Nakh settlements and building Cossack defense lines in the lowlands. The Cossacks suffered defeat after defeat and were constantly attacked by mountaineers, who were robbing them of food and weaponry.

The tsarists' regime used a different approach at the end of the 1860s. They offered Chechens and Ingush to leave the Caucasus for the Ottoman Empire (see [[Muhajir (Caucasus)]]). It is estimated that about 80% of Chechens and Ingush left the Caucasus during the deportation. It weakened the resistance which went from open warfare to insurgent warfare. One of the notable Chechen resistance fighters at the end of the 19th century was a Chechen [[abrek]] [[Zelimkhan|Zelimkhan Gushmazukaev]] and his comrade-in-arms Ingush abrek Sulom-Beck Sagopshinski. Together they built up small units which constantly harassed Russian military convoys, government mints, and government post-service, mainly in Ingushetia and Chechnya. Ingush aul Kek was completely burned when the Ingush refused to hand over Zelimkhan. Zelimkhan was killed at the beginning of the twentieth century. The war between Nakh tribes and Russia resurfaced during the times of the [[Russian Revolution]], which saw the Nakh struggle against [[Anton Denikin]] and later against the [[Soviet Union]].

On 21 December 1917, [[Ingushetia]], Chechnya, and Dagestan declared independence from Russia and formed a single state: "United Mountain Dwellers of the North Caucasus" (also known as the [[Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus]]) which was recognized by major world powers. The capital of the new state was moved to Temir-Khan-Shura (Dagestan).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://w.ethnia.org/polity.php?ASK_CODE=KC__&ASK_YY=1917&ASK_MM=12&ASK_DD=21&SL=en |title=Independent Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus |work=Countries & Territories since 1900 |access-date=25 May 2023 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230525114537/http://w.ethnia.org/polity.php?ASK_CODE=KC__&ASK_YY=1917&ASK_MM=12&ASK_DD=21&SL=en |archive-date=2023-05-25 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://savechechnya.com/eng.news/press_1273.htm |title=Общественное движение чеченский комитет национального спасения |publisher=Savechechnya.com |date=24 June 2008 |access-date=14 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223044426/http://savechechnya.com/eng.news/press_1273.htm |archive-date=23 February 2014 }}</ref> [[Tapa Tchermoeff]], a prominent Chechen statesman, was elected the first prime minister of the state.

===Soviet rule===
During Soviet rule, Chechnya and Ingushetia were combined to form the [[Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]. In the 1930s, Chechnya was flooded with many Ukrainians fleeing a [[Holodomor|famine]].

The territory of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was divided between [[Stavropol Krai]] (where [[Grozny Okrug]] was formed), the [[Dagestan ASSR]], the [[North Ossetian ASSR]], and the [[Georgian SSR]].

The Chechens and Ingush were allowed to return to their land after 1956 during [[de-Stalinisation]] under [[Nikita Khrushchev]]<ref name="Encarta 2008"/> when the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was restored but with both the boundaries and ethnic composition of the territory significantly changed. There were many (predominantly Russian) migrants from other parts of the [[Soviet Union]], who often settled in the abandoned family homes of Chechens and Ingushes. The republic lost its [[Prigorodny District, Republic of North Ossetia–Alania|Prigorodny District]] which transferred to North Ossetian ASSR but gained predominantly Russian [[Naursky District]] and [[Shelkovskoy District]] that is considered the homeland for [[Terek Cossacks]].

The [[Russification]] policies towards Chechens continued after 1956, with [[Russian language]] proficiency required in many aspects of life to provide Chechens better opportunities for advancement in the Soviet system.<ref name="ling"/>

On 26 November 1990, the Supreme Council of Chechen-Ingush ASSR adopted the "Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Chechen-Ingush Republic". This declaration was part of the reorganisation of the Soviet Union. This new treaty was to be signed 22 August 1991, which would have transformed 15 republic states into more than 80. The 19–21 August [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt]] led to the abandonment of this reorganisation.<ref>James Hughes. "The Peace Process in Chechnya", in Richard Sakwa (ed.), ''Chechnya: From Past to Future'', p. 271.</ref>

With the impending dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, an independence movement, the [[All-National Congress of the Chechen People|Chechen National Congress]], was formed, led by ex-[[Soviet Air Force]] general and new Chechen President [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]]. It campaigned for the recognition of Chechnya as a separate nation. This movement was opposed by [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s [[Russian Federation]], which argued that Chechnya had not been an independent entity within the Soviet Union—as the Baltic, Central Asian, and other Caucasian states such as Georgia had—but was part of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] and hence did not have a right under the Soviet constitution to secede. It also argued that other [[republics of Russia]], such as [[Tatarstan]], would consider seceding from the Russian Federation if Chechnya were granted that right. Finally, it argued that Chechnya was a major hub in the oil infrastructure of Russia and hence its secession would hurt the country's economy and energy access.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

During the [[Chechen Revolution]], the Soviet Chechen leader [[Doku Zavgayev]] was overthrown and Dzhokhar Dudayev seized power. On 1 November 1991, Dudaev's Chechnya issued a unilateral declaration of independence. In the ensuing decade, the territory was locked in an ongoing struggle between various factions, usually fighting unconventionally.

===Chechen Wars and brief independence===
{{Main|First Chechen War|Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Second Chechen War}}

The First Chechen War, during which Russian forces attempted to regain control over Chechnya, took place from 1994 to 1996. Despite overwhelming numerical superiority in troops, weaponry, and [[air support]], the Russian forces were unable to establish effective permanent control over the mountainous area due to numerous successful full-scale battles and [[insurgency]] raids. The [[Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis]] in 1995 shocked the Russian public.

In April 1996, the first democratically elected president of Chechnya, [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]], was killed by Russian forces using a booby trap bomb and a missile fired from a warplane after he was located by triangulating the position of a [[satellite phone]] he was using.<ref>{{Cite news|title = 'Dual attack' killed president|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/325347.stm|publisher = BBC|date = 21 April 1999|access-date = 1 January 2016}}</ref>

The widespread [[morale|demoralisation]] of the Russian forces in the area and a successful offensive to re-take Grozny by Chechen rebel forces led by [[Aslan Maskhadov]] prompted [[Russian President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] to declare a ceasefire in 1996, and sign a [[peace treaty]] a year later that saw a withdrawal of Russian forces.<ref>{{Cite web|publisher = Friends & Partners |title=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty archive |volume=1 |issue=28 |at=part I |date=12 May 1997|url = http://www.friends-partners.org/friends/news/omri/1997/05/970512I.html|website = friends-partners.org|access-date = 1 January 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117033829/http://www.friends-partners.org/friends/news/omri/1997/05/970512I.html|archive-date = 17 November 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref>

After the war, parliamentary and presidential elections took place in January 1997 in Chechnya and brought to power new President Aslan Maskhadov, chief of staff and prime minister in the Chechen coalition government, for a five-year term. Maskhadov sought to maintain Chechen sovereignty while pressing the Russian government to help rebuild the republic, whose formal economy and infrastructure were virtually destroyed.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.freedomhouse.org/modules/mod_call_dsp_country-fiw.cfm?year=2003&country=2593| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111024203612/http://www.freedomhouse.org/modules/mod_call_dsp_country-fiw.cfm?year=2003&country=2593| url-status = dead| archive-date = 24 October 2011| title = Chechnya [Russia] (2003) |work=Freedom House}}</ref> Russia continued to send money for the rehabilitation of the republic; it also provided pensions and funds for schools and hospitals.

President Maskhadov started a major campaign against hostage-takers, and on 25 October 1998, Shadid Bargishev, Chechnya's top anti-kidnapping official, was killed in a remote-controlled car bombing. Bargishev's colleagues then insisted they would not be intimidated by the attack and would go ahead with their offensive. Political violence and religious extremism, blamed on "[[Wahhabism]]", was rife. In 1998, Grozny authorities declared a [[state of emergency]]. Tensions led to open clashes between the Chechen National Guard and Islamist militants, such as the July 1998 confrontation in Gudermes.

In response to these attacks, Russia tightened its grip on Chechnya and expanded its anti-terrorist operations throughout the region. Russia installed a pro-Russian Chechen regime.

Situated in the eastern part of the [[North Caucasus]] in [[Eastern Europe]], Chechnya is surrounded on nearly all sides by Russian Federal territory. In the west, it borders [[North Ossetia]] and [[Ingushetia]], in the north, [[Stavropol Krai]], in the east, Dagestan, and to the south, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Its capital is Grozny. Chechnya is well known for being mountainous, but it is in fact split between the more flat areas north of the Terek, and the highlands south of the Terek.

====Christianity====
{{See also|History of Chechnya#Religion|Mongol invasions of Durdzuketia#Religious implications }}
[[File:Церковь Михаила Архангела, Грозный.jpg|thumb|Church of Archangel Michael in Grozny]]
From the 11th to 13th centuries (i.e. before [[Mongol invasions of Durdzuketia]]), there was a mission of Georgian Orthodox missionaries to the Nakh peoples. Their success was limited, though a couple of highland [[teip]]s did convert (conversion was largely by teips). However, during the Mongol invasions, these Christianized teips gradually reverted to paganism, perhaps due to the loss of trans-Caucasian contacts as the Georgians fought the Mongols and briefly fell under their dominion.

The once-strong Russian minority in Chechnya, mostly [[Terek Cossacks]] and estimated as numbering approximately 25,000 in 2012, are predominantly [[Russian Orthodox]], although currently only one church exists in Grozny. In August 2011, Archbishop Zosima of [[Vladikavkaz]] and [[Makhachkala]] performed the first mass [[baptism]] ceremony in the history of the Chechen Republic in the [[Terek River]] of [[Naursky District]] in which 35 citizens of Naursky and Shelkovsky districts were converted to Orthodoxy.<ref>Interfax Information Services Group. [http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&div=8678 "Chechnya saw the first mass baptism in its today's history"]. Retrieved 9 July 2012.</ref> As of 2020, there are eight Orthodox churches in Chechnya, the largest is the temple of the Archangel Michael in Grozny.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Chechnya}}

Since 1990, the Chechen Republic has had many legal, military, and civil conflicts involving separatist movements and pro-Russian authorities. Chechnya has enjoyed a period of relative stability under the Russian-appointed government, although there is still some separatist movement activity.<ref>{{cite news |title=Chechnya profile |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18188085 |access-date=15 April 2024 |publisher=BBC |date=28 August 2023}}</ref> Its regional constitution entered into effect on 2 April 2003, after an all-Chechen referendum was held on 23 March 2003. Some Chechens were controlled by regional [[teip]]s, or clans, despite the existence of pro- and anti-Russian political structures.

In the [[2024 Russian presidential election]], which critics called rigged and fraudulent,<ref>{{cite news |title=The extent of fraud in Russia's presidential election begins to emerge |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/03/20/the-extent-of-fraud-in-russia-s-presidential-election-begins-to-emerge_6638830_4.html |work=[[Le Monde]] |date=20 March 2024}}</ref> Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] won 98.99% of the vote in Chechnya.<ref>{{cite news |title=Chechnya boosts Putin re-election with almost 100% of the votes |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/chechnya-boosts-putin-election-almost-095933820.html |work=Yahoo News |agency=Deutsche Presse-Agentur |date=18 March 2024}}</ref>

===Regional government===
[[File:Vladimir Putin 8 November 2000-1.jpg|thumb|[[Akhmad Kadyrov]], former separatist and [[head of the Chechen Republic]], with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]], 8 November 2000]]

The former separatist religious leader (mufti) [[Akhmad Kadyrov]] was elected president with 83% of the vote in an internationally monitored election on 5 October 2003. Incidents of [[ballot stuffing]] and voter intimidation by Russian soldiers and the exclusion of separatist parties from the polls were subsequently reported by [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) monitors. On 9 May 2004, Kadyrov was assassinated in Grozny football stadium by a [[land mine|landmine]] explosion that was planted beneath a VIP stage and detonated during a parade, and [[Sergey Abramov (politician)|Sergey Abramov]] was appointed acting prime minister after the incident. However, since 2005 [[Ramzan Kadyrov]] (son of Akhmad Kadyrov) has been the caretaker prime minister, and in 2007 was appointed as the new president. Many{{who|date=April 2024}} allege he is the wealthiest and most powerful man in the republic, with control over a large private militia (the [[Kadyrovites]]). The militia, which began as his father's security force, has been accused of killings and kidnappings by human rights organisations such as [[Human Rights Watch]].

The president of this government was [[Aslan Maskhadov]], and the foreign minister was [[Ilyas Akhmadov]], who was the spokesman for the president. Maskhadov had been elected for four years in an internationally monitored election in 1997, which took place after signing a peace agreement with Russia. In 2001, he issued a decree prolonging his office for one additional year; he was unable to participate in the 2003 presidential election since separatist parties were barred by the Russian government, and Maskhadov faced accusations of terrorist offenses in Russia. Maskhadov left Grozny and moved to the separatist-controlled areas of the south at the onset of the [[Second Chechen War]]. Maskhadov was unable to influence a number of warlords who retain effective control over Chechen territory, and his power was diminished as a result. Russian forces killed Maskhadov on 8 March 2005, and the assassination was widely criticized since it left no legitimate Chechen separatist leader with whom to conduct peace talks. [[Akhmed Zakayev]], deputy prime minister and a foreign minister under Maskhadov, was appointed shortly after the 1997 election and is currently living under asylum in [[England]]. He and others chose [[Abdul Khalim Saidullayev]], a relatively unknown Islamic judge who was previously the host of an Islamic program on Chechen television, to replace Maskhadov following his death. On 17 June 2006, it was reported that Russian special forces killed Abdul Khalim Saidullayev in a raid in the Chechen town of [[Argun, Chechen Republic|Argun]]. On 10 July 2006, [[Shamil Basayev]], a leader of the Chechen rebel movement, was killed in a truck explosion during an arms deal.

The successor of Saidullayev became [[Doku Umarov]]. On 31 October 2007, Umarov abolished the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] and its presidency and in its place proclaimed the [[Caucasus Emirate]] with himself as its [[Emir]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itstime.it/Commenti/CaucEmiri.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511232726/http://www.itstime.it/Commenti/CaucEmiri.pdf |archive-date=2011-05-11 |url-status=live |title=What is Hidden Behind the Idea of the Caucasian Emirate? |access-date=19 April 2013}}</ref> This change of status has been rejected by many Chechen politicians and military leaders who continue to support the existence of the republic.

During the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]], the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian parliament]] voted to recognize the "Chechen Republic of Ichkeria as territory temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation".<ref>{{Cite news |date=18 October 2022 |title=Ukraine lawmakers brand Chechnya 'Russian-occupied' in dig at Kremlin |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-lawmakers-brand-chechnya-russian-occupied-dig-kremlin-2022-10-18/ |access-date=20 October 2022}}</ref>

In 2006, [[Human Rights Watch]] reported that pro-Russian Chechen forces under the command of [[Ramzan Kadyrov]], as well as federal police personnel, used torture to get information about separatist forces. "If you are detained in Chechnya, you face a real and immediate risk of torture.

On 1 February 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'' released extensive evidence to support allegations of consistent torture and executions under the Kadyrov government.

On 1 July 2009, [[Amnesty International]] released a detailed report covering the human rights violations committed by the [[Russian Federation]] against Chechen citizens. Among the most prominent features was that those abused had no method of redress against assaults, ranging from kidnapping to torture, while those responsible were never held accountable.
