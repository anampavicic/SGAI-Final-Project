It serves as the administrative center of [[Brest Region]] and [[Brest District]], though it is administratively separated from the district.<ref name="pop"/> As of 2024, it has a population of 344,470.<ref name="pop"/>

Brest is one of the oldest cities in Belarus and a historical site for many cultures, as it hosted important historical events, such as the [[Union of Brest]] and [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]. Furthermore, the [[Brest Fortress]] was recognized by the [[Soviet Union]] as a [[Hero Fortress]] in honour of the [[defense of Brest Fortress]] in June 1941.

In the [[High Middle Ages]], the city often passed between Poland, the principalities of [[Kievan Rus']], and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. From the [[Late Middle Ages]], the city was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which later became a part of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] from 1569. In 1795, it was incorporated into the [[Russian Empire]] with the [[Third Partition of Poland]]. After the [[Polish-Soviet War]], the city became part of the [[Second Polish Republic]]. In 1939, the city was captured by [[Nazi Germany]] during the [[invasion of Poland]] and then transferred to the [[Soviet Union]] per the [[German–Soviet Frontier Treaty]]. In 1941, it was retaken by the Germans during [[Operation Barbarossa]]. In 1944, it was retaken by the Soviet [[Red Army]] during the [[Lublin–Brest offensive]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brest-belarus.com/History_1900_2005.shtml#section10 |title=BREST-LITOVSK, BREST, BRISK, BRESTYE, BERESTIE, BERESTOV, BRZESC, sometimes Russia or Poland and now Belarus - Jewish Genealogy - Searching for our ancestors |website=www.brest-belarus.com |access-date=11 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050509081415/http://www.brest-belarus.com/History_1900_2005.shtml#section10 |archive-date=9 May 2005 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The city was part of the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]] until the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|breakup of the USSR]] in 1991. Since then, Brest has been part of independent [[Belarus]].

==Etymology==
Several theories attempt to explain the origin of the city's name. The name could originate from Slavic root ''berest'' '[[elm]]'. It could likewise have come from the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] word ''brasta'' '[[ford (crossing)|ford]]'.<ref>[[Encyclopedia Lituanica]]. [[Boston, Massachusetts]], Vol. I, p. 409. LCC74-114275</ref>

Traditionally, Belarusian speakers called the city {{lang|be|Берасце}} ({{lang|be-Latn|Bieraście}}), similar to the Ukrainian name {{lang|uk|Берестя}} ({{lang|uk|Berestia}}).

Once a center of Jewish scholarship, the city has the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] name {{lang|yi|בריסק}} ({{lang|yi-Latn|Brisk}}), hence the term [[Brisk tradition and Soloveitchik dynasty|"Brisker"]] used to describe followers of the influential [[Soloveitchik]] family of [[rabbi]]s.

Brest became a part of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] in 1319.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Auzias |first1= Dominique |last2= Labourdette |first2= Jean-Paul |chapter= Brest et sa région |title= Biélorussie |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GTMVnlCyezAC |series= Country Guides |publisher= Petit Futé |date= 2010 |page= 121 |isbn= 9782746937796 |quote= {{lang|fr|D'abord russe, ensuite polonaise, en 1319, Brest est conquis par le prince Gedimin et rattaché au grand-duché de Lituanie.}} [At first Russian, then Polish, Brest in 1319 was conquered by Prince [[Gediminas]] and absorbed into the grand Duchy of Lithuania.]}}</ref> In the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] formed in 1569, the town became known in [[Polish language|Polish]] as {{lang|pl| Brześć}}, historically {{lang|pl|Brześć Litewski}} (literally: "Lithuanian Brest", in contradistinction to [[Brześć Kujawski]]). {{lang|pl|Brześć|italics= no}} became part of the [[Russian Empire]] under the name {{lang|ru-Latn|Brest-Litovsk}} or {{lang|ru-Latn|Brest-Litovskii}} ({{langx|ru|Брест-Литовск}}, {{lang|ru|Брест-Литовский}}, literally "Lithuanian Brest") in the course of the [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1795. After World War I, and the rebirth of Poland in 1918, the government of the [[Second Polish Republic]] renamed the city as {{lang|ru-Latn|Brześć nad Bugiem}} ("Brest on the Bug") on 20 March 1923.<ref>Kancelaria Sejmu RP (2013), [http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/DetailsServlet?id=WDU19230390269 Dz.U. 1923 nr 39 poz. 269 ] ISAP Archive. Link to PDF document.</ref> After World War II, the city became part of the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] with the name simplified as Brest.

Brest's coat of arms, adopted on 26 January 1991, features an arrow pointed upwards and a bow (both silver) on a sky-blue shield. An alternative coat of arms has a red shield. [[Sigismund II Augustus]], King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, first granted Brest a coat of arms in 1554.

==History==
[[File:Brest Lm.jpg|thumb|upright|left|In 1019, Brest was first mentioned in chronicles as "''Berestye''"]]
As a town, Brest – ''Berestij'' in [[Kievan Rus]] – was first mentioned in the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' in 1019 when the [[Kievan Rus']] took the stronghold from the Poles.

===Grand Duchy of Lithuania===
In 1319, the city became part of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], and Grand Duke [[Gediminas]] stayed in the city in the winter of 1319–1320, preparing to capture [[Kyiv]].<ref name=sgk399/>{{sfn|Mondalski|1929|p=47}} In 1349, it was captured by King [[Casimir III of Poland]], however, it was restored to Lithuania in 1352.<ref>Halecki, p. 71</ref> Its suburbs were burned by the [[Teutonic Order]] in 1379. In 1385, it became part of the [[Polish–Lithuanian union]]. During the [[Lithuanian Civil War (1389–1392)]], in 1390, the city was captured by Polish forces of [[Władysław II Jagiełło]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Halecki|first=Oskar|year=2013|title=Dzieje Unii Jagiellońskiej.

In 1390, Brześć became the second city in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (after the capital [[Vilnius]]), and the first in the lands that now are Belarus, to receive [[Magdeburg rights]].<ref name=jb>{{cite magazine|last=Bardach|first=Juliusz|title=Miasta na prawie magdeburskim w Wielkim Księstwie Litewskim od schyłku XIV do połowy XVII stulecia|magazine=Kwartalnik Historyczny|volume=87|issue=1|year=1980|language=pl|page=25}}</ref> Given its proximity to Poland, it was a significant centre for trade with Poland.<ref name=jb/>

In 1419 it became a seat of the [[starost]] in the newly created [[Trakai Voivodeship]]. Under Władysław II and Vytautas the city was significantly developed and granted privileges similar to those of the Polish city of [[Lublin]].<ref name=sgk399>{{cite book|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Słownik geograficzny Królestwa Polskiego i innych krajów słowiańskich, Tom I|year=1880|language=pl|location=Warszawa|page=399}}</ref>{{sfn|Mondalski|1929|pp=51, 53}} In 1425, the city hosted a congress attended by Władysław II, Vytautas, dukes of [[Masovia]] and Polish and Lithuanian nobles.<ref>Halecki, p. 229</ref> In 1440, a [[Sejm of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] was held in the city, at which [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] was chosen Grand Duke of Lithuania.<ref name=sgk399/>{{sfn|Mondalski|1929|p=53}} In 1446, a meeting of Casimir IV, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, and Polish senators regarding the political affiliation of [[Volhynia]] took place in the city, and in 1454 Casimir IV met with Lithuanian nobility to convince them to participate in the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454–1466)|Polish–Teutonic War]] on the side of Poland.<ref name=sgk399/>{{sfn|Mondalski|1929|pp=53, 55}}

===Polish—Lithuanian Commonwealth===
In 1500, it was burned again by [[Crimean Tatars]]. From 1513, the city was administratively located in the [[Podlaskie Voivodeship (1513–1795)|Podlaskie Voivodeship]]. In 1566, following the decree of [[Sigismund II Augustus]], a new [[Voivodeships of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|voivodeship]] was created – [[Brest Litovsk Voivodeship]].

During the union of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and the [[Swedish Empire]] under king [[Sigismund III Vasa]] ([[Polish–Swedish union]]), diets were held there. In 1594 and 1596, it was the meeting-place of two remarkable councils of regional bishops of the [[Roman-Catholic Church]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. The 1596 council [[Union of Brest|established]] the [[Uniate Church]] (also known as the [[Belarusian Greek Catholic Church]] in Belarus and [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] in [[Ukraine]]). A [[Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was held in the city in 1653.<ref>{{cite book|last=Konopczyński|first=Władysław|year=1948|title=Chronologia sejmów polskich 1493–1793|language=pl|location=Kraków|publisher=[[Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences|Polska Akademia Umiejętności]]|page=153}}</ref> A royal mint was founded in the city by King [[John II Casimir Vasa]] in 1665.

In 1657, and again in 1706, the town and castle were captured by the [[Swedish Army]] during its [[Polish–Swedish wars|invasions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Then, in an attack from the other direction, on 13 January 1660, the invading [[Streltsy]] of the [[Tsardom of Russia]] under [[Ivan Andreyevich Khovansky (Tararui)|Ivan Andreyevich Khovansky]] took the [[Brest Castle (Belarus)|Brest Castle]] in an early morning surprise attack, the town having been captured earlier, and massacred the 1,700 defenders and their families (according to an Austrian observer, Captain Rosestein).

====Partitions====
On 23 July 1792, the defending [[Grand Ducal Lithuanian Army]], under the leadership of [[Szymon Zabiełło]], and the invading [[Imperial Russian Army]] fought a battle near Brześć. On 19 September 1794, the area between Brest and [[Terespol]] was the site of another [[Battle of Brest (1794)|battle]] won by the Russian invaders led by [[Alexander Suvorov]] over a Polish-Lithuanian division under General [[Karol Sierakowski]]. Thereafter, Brest was annexed by Russia when [[Third Partition of Poland|the Poland-Lithuania Commonwealth was partitioned for the third time]] in 1795.

===19th century to World War I===
During Russian rule in the 19th century, [[Brest Fortress]] was built in and around the city. The Russians demolished the [[Brest Castle (Belarus)|Polish Royal Castle]] and most Old Town "to make room" for the fortress.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The main Jewish synagogue in the city, the [[Choral Synagogue (Brest)|Choral Synagogue]], was completed c. 1862.

In March 1918, in the Brest Fortress at the confluence of the [[Bug (river)|Bug]] and [[Mukhavets]] rivers on the city' western outskirts, the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] was signed, ending the war between [[Soviet Russia]] and the [[Central Powers]] and transferring the city and its surrounding region to the [[Ober Ost|sphere of influence]] of the [[German Empire]]. This treaty was subsequently annulled by the [[Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920)|Paris Peace Conference]] treaties which ended the war and even more so by events and developments in [[Central and Eastern Europe]].

The city was developed significantly and a number of representative public buildings were erected in [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] and [[Modern architecture|Modernist]] styles, especially at ''Ulica Unii Lubelskiej'' ([[Union of Lublin]] Street, now Lenin Street), including the Bank of Poland, Tax Chamber, Regional Chamber of the State Control, Healthcare Fund and Voivodeship Office.{{sfn|Pszczółkowski|2014|pp=13, 15, 17, 29-30}} Other notable projects include the officials' housing estate, stylistically inspired by historic [[manor houses of Polish nobility]] and the [[garden city movement]], and the Warburg Residential Colony, dedicated to poor Jews who had lost their homes in World War I, founded by Felix M.

In the twenty years of Poland's sovereignty, of the total of 36 brand new schools established in the city, there were ten public, and five private [[Jewish day school|Jewish schools]] inaugurated, with [[Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as the language of instruction. The first-ever Jewish school in Brześć history opened in 1920, almost immediately after Poland's return to independence. In 1936 Jews constituted 41.3% of the Brześć population or 21,518 citizens.

In the centre are Major General [[Heinz Guderian]] from the [[Wehrmacht]] and Brigadier [[Semyon Krivoshein]] from the [[Red Army]].]]

In early September 1939, the Polish government evacuated a portion of the Polish [[gold reserve]] from [[Warsaw]] to Brześć, and then further southeast to [[Śniatyn]] at the Poland-[[Romania]] border, from where it was transported via Romania and [[Turkey]] to territory controlled by [[Franco-Polish alliance (1921)|Polish-allied]] [[France]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Wróbel|first=Janusz|year=2002|title=Wojenne losy polskiego złota|magazine=Biuletyn Instytutu Pamięci Narodowej|language=pl|publisher=[[Institute of National Remembrance|IPN]]|issue=8-9 (19-20)|pages=55–58|issn=1641-9561}}</ref>

During the German [[Invasion of Poland]] in 1939, the city was defended by a small garrison of four infantry battalions under General [[Konstanty Plisowski]] against General [[Heinz Guderian]]'s [[XIX Army Corps|XIX Panzer Corps]]. After [[Battle of Brześć Litewski|four days of heavy fighting]], the Polish forces withdrew southwards on 17 September. The [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] began on the same day. As a result, the Soviet [[Red Army]] entered the city at the end of September 1939 following the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]'s Secret Protocol, and a joint [[German–Soviet military parade in Brest-Litovsk|Nazi-Soviet military parade]] took place on 22 September 1939. While Belarusians consider it a reunification of the Belarusian nation under one constituency (the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] at that time), Poles consider it the date when the city was lost. During the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|Soviet control]] (1939–41), the Polish population was subject to arrests, executions and mass deportations to [[Siberia]] and the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]]. Many Poles were imprisoned in the local prison, and then moved to a prison in [[Minsk]].<ref name=ez>{{cite magazine|last=Ziółkowska|first=Ewa|year=2009|title=Kuropaty|magazine=Biuletyn Instytutu Pamięci Narodowej|language=pl|publisher=[[Institute of National Remembrance|IPN]]|issue=1–2 (96–97)|page=51|issn=1641-9561}}</ref> It is suspected that they were murdered by the Soviets in the [[Katyn massacre]] in 1940.<ref name=ez/>

On 22 June 1941, Brest Fortress and the city were attacked by [[Nazi Germany]] on the first day of [[Operation Barbarossa]], [[Nazi Germany]]'s invasion of the [[Soviet Union]]. The fortress [[Defense of Brest Fortress|held out for six days]]. Nearly all its Soviet army defenders perished. The Germans placed Brest under the administration of the ''[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]]''. The remaining municipal Jewish population (about 20,000) was sequestered in the [[Brześć Ghetto|Brest ghetto]] established by the German authorities in December 1941 and later murdered in October 1942. Only seven Jews survived the Nazi executions.<ref name=Browning/>

The [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance movement]], including the Polesie District of the [[Home Army]], was active in the city.

The city was re-occupied by the [[Red Army]] on 28 July 1944, and eventually annexed from Poland the following year.

===Post-war period===
In 1945, the ''Związek Obrońców Wolności'' ("Freedom Defenders Association") Polish resistance organization was founded in the city, with its activities including secret Polish schooling, rescuing historical Polish monuments from devastation and organising aid for repressed people and those in a difficult material situation.<ref name=kktl>{{cite magazine|last1=Krajewski|first1=Kazimierz|last2=Łabuszewski|first2=Tomasz|year=2009|title=Ostatni obrońcy Kresow Połnocno-Wschodnich|magazine=Biuletyn Instytutu Pamięci Narodowej|language=pl|publisher=IPN|issue=1–2 (96–97)|pages=105–106|issn=1641-9561}}</ref> The organization was crushed by the [[NKVD]] in 1948, and its members were deported to [[Gulag]] [[Forced labor in the Soviet Union|forced labour]] camps for 25 years.<ref name=kktl/>

==Geography==
Brest lies astride the [[Mukhavets]] River which flows west through the city, dividing it into north and south, and meets the [[Bug (river)|Bug River]] in the Brest Fortress. The river flows slowly and gently. Today the river looks quite broad in Brest. The terrain is fairly flat around Brest. The river has an extremely broad [[floodplain]], that is about {{convert|2|to|3|km|0|abbr=off}} across. Brest was subject to flooding in the past. One of the worst floods in recorded history occurred in 1974.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Part of the [[floodplain]] was reclaimed with [[hydraulic mining]]. In the 1980s, big cutter-suction [[dredgers]] mined sand and clay from the riverbed to build up the banks.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

In the 2000s, two new residential areas were developed in the southwest of Brest.

To the east of Brest, the [[Dnieper–Bug Canal]] was built in the mid-nineteenth century to join the river to [[Pina (river)|Pina]], a tributary of the [[Pripyat (river)|Pripyat River]] which in turn drains into the [[Dnieper]]. Thus Brest has a shipping route all the way to the [[Black Sea]]. If not for a dam and neglected [[weir]]s west of Brest, north-western European shipping would be connected with the Black Sea also.

==Climate==
Brest has a [[humid continental climate]] but slightly leans towards oceanic due to the irregular winter temperatures that mostly hover around the freezing point. However, summers are warm and influenced by its inland position compared to areas nearer the [[Baltic Sea]].

A majestic Soviet-era war memorial was constructed on the site of the 1941 battle to commemorate the known and unknown defenders of the Brest Fortress. This war memorial is the largest tourist attraction in the city. The [[Berestye Archeological Museum]] of the old city is located on the southern island of the [[Hero-Fortress]]. It has objects and huts dating from the 11th – 13th century that were unearthed during the 1970s.

The Museum of Rescued Art Treasures has a collection of paintings and icons. [[Brest City Park]] is over 100 years old and underwent renovations from 2004 to 2006 as part of a ceremony marking the park's centennial. In July 2009, the [[Millennium Monument of Brest]] was unveiled. Sovetskaya Street is a popular tourist destination in Brest; it was dramatically reconstructed in 2007–2009. Other important landmarks include the [[Brest Railway Museum]].

==Education==
Brest is home to two Universities: [[A.S. Pushkin Brest State University]] and [[Brest State Technical University]]. There is also a branch of [[Belarusian National Technical University]].

Among the secondary specialized educational institutions of the city:

* Brest State Railway College
* Brest State Medical College
* Brest State Musical College named after G. Shirmy
* Brest State Regional College of the Olympic Reserve
* Brest State Polytechnic College - a branch of the Brest State Technical University
* Brest State Professional-Technical College of Instrument Engineering
* Brest State College of Transport and Service
* Brest State College of Light Industry
* Brest State College of Builders
* Brest State Trade and Technology College
* Brest State College of Communications
* Brest State College of Service Industry
* Brest branch of the capital's private educational institution "College of Business and Law."

==Transport==
Being situated on the main railway line connecting Berlin and Moscow, and a [[International E-road network|transcontinental highway]] (the [[M1 highway (Belarus)|M1 highway]] is part of the [[European route E30]] running from [[Cork (city)|Cork]] to [[Omsk]], where it links with [[AH6 (highway)|Asian Highway 6]] leading to [[Busan]]), Brest became a principal border crossing out of the Soviet Union in the postwar era. Today it links the [[European Union]] and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]].

The city of Brest is served by [[Brest-Tsentralny railway station]]. Because of the [[break-of-gauge]] at Brest, where the Russian [[broad gauge]] meets the European [[standard gauge]], all passenger trains, coming from [[Poland]], must have their [[bogie]]s [[Bogie exchange|replaced]] here, to travel on across [[Belarus]]. The freight must be [[Transloading|transloaded]] from cars of one gauge to cars of another.
