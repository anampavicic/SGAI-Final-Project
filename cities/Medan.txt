The city was founded at the confluence of the [[Deli River]] and the Babura river by a [[Karo people (Indonesia)|Karonese]] man named Guru Patimpus. Then called ''Kampung Medan Putri'', it became part of the [[Deli Sultanate]], established in 1632. In the late 19th century, [[Dutch East Indies|colonial Dutch]] seeking new plantation areas chose Medan and Deli as plantation hubs to found the [[Deli Company]]. Within a few years, the Dutch [[tobacco]] trade transformed Medan into an economic hub, earning it the nickname {{lang|nl|Het Land Dollar}} ("the land of the money"). The [[Deli Railway]], established to ship tobacco, [[rubber]], [[tea]], [[timber]], [[Palm oil production in Indonesia|palm oil]], and [[sugar]] from Medan to the [[Port of Belawan]] for worldwide export, brought further rapid development to Medan. The city became first the capital of the [[State of East Sumatra]], and then the provincial capital of North Sumatra.

== Etymology ==
The term ''medan'' might be derived from the [[Batak Karo language|Batak Karo]] word {{transl|btx|madan}} ({{lang|btx|ᯔᯑᯉ᯳}}), which literally means 'healed', 'blessed', or 'recovered'.<ref name="KB">{{cite book |last= Joustra |first= M. |date= 1907 |title= Karo-Bataksch Woordenboek |trans-title= Karo Batak dictionary |url=https://www.e-hsl.com/sources?sourceID=Joustra+1907 |language=nl |location= |publisher=  |isbn=}}</ref> The term is associated with the historical Karo figure and founder of the city, traditional doctor {{Ill|Guru Patimpus|id}}. The oldest evidence of this term used to refer to the city dates back to {{circa}} 13th-15th century during the reign of [[Aru Kingdom|Aru]], the Karo monarch.<ref name="AR">{{cite book |last1= Pelly |first1=Usman |last2=R. |first2= Ratna |last3=Kardarmadja |first3= M.

Another popular theory suggests that ''medan'' is of [[Malay language|Malay]] origin, literally meaning 'field'. The term ''medan'' ({{lang|ms|مدان}}) in Malay might be derived from the [[Malayalam]] word {{transl|ml|maitānam}} ({{lang|ml|മൈതാനം}}, 'field'), which is cognate with the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word {{transl|ta|maitāṉ-am}} ({{lang|ta|மைதானம்}}, 'ground').<ref name="MD">{{cite book |last= Meuraxa |first= Dada |date= 1973 |title= Sejarah kebudayaan suku-suku di Sumatera Utara |trans-title= Cultural history of tribes in North Sumatra  |url= |language=id |location= Indonesia |publisher=  Sasterawan |isbn=}}</ref>

In the sixteenth century, Guru Patimpus Sembiring Pelawi, a [[Karo people (Indonesia)|Karonese]] man from the [[Karo Regency]], converted from [[Pemena]] to [[Islam]]. While traveling to study under Datuk Kota Bangun, Guru Patimpus met and married the Princess of {{interlanguage link|Pulo Brayan|id}}. Accompanied by their two sons, Kolok and Kecik, the couple founded Medan village between the [[Deli River|Deli]] and Babura Rivers.{{cn|date=August 2023}}

In 1632, the [[Aceh Sultanate]] under [[Gocah Pahlawan]] expanded to include Medan. [[Perunggit]] succeeded his father in 1669, and declared the [[Deli Sultanate]], including Medan, independent of the Aceh Sultanate.

Starting in the 1860s, Dutch authorities began to release new land for tobacco plantations. Said Abdullah Bilsagih, brother-in-law of the Deli Sultan Mahmud Perkasa Alam, persuaded Dutch tobacco merchant [[Jacob Nienhuys]] to move his business from Java to Deli. Dutch merchants Van der Falk and Elliot, and Chinese brothers [[Tjong Yong Hian]] and [[Tjong A Fie]], were also pioneers of Deli's tobacco industry. In 1867, Nienhuys, Jannsen, P.W. Clemen, and Cremer founded [[Deli Company|De Deli Maatschappij]]; in 1869, they moved its head office from [[Labuhan Deli]] to Medan. This made Medan a centre of the tobacco trade, which continued to grow with the 1869 opening of the [[Suez Canal]].

[[Sultan Ma'mun Al Rashid Perkasa Alamyah]], who ruled from 1873 to 1924, moved the kingdom's capital to Medan. He became known as the builder of early Medan, finishing the construction of the [[Maimun Palace]] in 1888 and building the [[Great Mosque of Medan]] in 1907. In 1898, a Dutch businessman named [[Hotel de Boer|Aeint Herman de Boer]] built [[Hotel de Boer]] to accommodate the cruise ships of European tourists which had begun to visit Medan.

During the 1942 [[Dutch East Indies campaign]], the Japanese entered Medan on bicycles and occupied the city. The handover of power was chaotic, but through the use of the [[Kempetai]].

Medan continued to grow as a centre of commerce during the reign of {{interlanguage link|Amaluddin Al Sani Perkasa Alamsyah|id}}. 
Developments of the 1970s, especially [[palm oil]] and [[Natural rubber|rubber]] plantations, made Medan the busiest city outside Java, with the [[transmigration program]] bringing many [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and [[Batak]] migrants.

In May 1998, months of student demonstrations in Medan over the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] turned into [[May 1998 riots of Indonesia|riots]] when a student was killed in a clash with security forces. The next day, the mobs became bigger, and many shops and vehicles in the business district (mostly owned by Chinese residents) were burned and looted. As a result, a curfew was imposed for more than two weeks until peace returned.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Shenon |first=Philip |date=1994-04-24 |title=Rioters Attack Ethnic Chinese In Indonesia |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/24/world/rioters-attack-ethnic-chinese-in-indonesia.html |access-date=2023-02-22 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

On 5 September 2005, [[Mandala Airlines Flight 091]] stalled a minute after taking off from Medan's old [[Polonia International Airport]] for a flight to Jakarta. The aircraft crashed into a heavily populated residential area along Djamin Ginting road in ''Padang Bulan''. Of the 117 passengers and crews on board, only 17 survived, and an additional 49 civilians on the ground were killed.<ref name="ASN">{{cite web|last=Ranter|first=Harro|title=ASN Aircraft accident Boeing 737–230 PK-RIM Medan-Polonia Airport (MES)|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20050905-0|website=aviation-safety.net|publisher=[[Aviation Safety Network]]}}</ref> As a result, [[Kualanamu International Airport]] was built in [[Deli Serdang]] to replace the old airport, with construction finished in 2012. After the move to the new airport, [[height restriction laws]] in Medan were relaxed.

==Geography==
Medan is in the northeastern part of [[Sumatra]] island, in the province of [[North Sumatra]]. The city is a [[Enclave and exclave|semi-enclave]] within Deli Serdang Regency, bordered by that regency on three sides and by the [[Strait of Malacca]] to the north. The natural harbor formed where the [[Deli River|Deli]] and Babura rivers feed into the straits has contributed to Medan's growth as a trading port.<ref>Usman Pelly, Sejarah Kota Madya Medan, 1950–1979; Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan R.I., Proyek Inventarisasi dan Dokumentasi Sejarah Nasional, Direktorat Sejarah dan Nilai Tradisional, 1985</ref> 

Medan's elevation varies between {{cvt|2.5|and|37.5|m|abbr=out}} above sea level, with the [[Barisan Mountains]] to the south, and volcanoes such as [[Sibayak]] Mountain and [[Sinabung]] Mountain {{cvt|50|to|70|km|abbr=off}} from the city.{{cn|date=September 2023}}

==Government==
[[File:Medan old city hall.jpg|upright|thumb|The former [[Medan City Hall]]]]

Medan was governed by [[Abdillah (Indonesian politician)|Abdillah]] from 2000 until 2008, when he and his vice mayor were caught by the [[Corruption Eradication Commission]]. [[Syamsul Arifin]], the governor of North Sumatra Province, appointed {{interlanguage link|Affifudin Lubis|id}} as acting mayor, followed by [[Rahudman Harahap]] after Lubis's 2009 resignation. Harahap resigned in order to run for office in the 2010 mayoral election, leaving Arifin himself to become acting mayor. In 2013, Harahap was also arrested for corruption, and his deputy [[Dzulmi Eldin]] became acting mayor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://koran-indonesia.com/2013/05/kpk-arrests-mandailing-natal-mayor-for-alleged-bribery/ |title=KPK Arrests Mandailing Natal Mayor for Alleged Bribery |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140301140206/http://koran-indonesia.com/2013/05/kpk-arrests-mandailing-natal-mayor-for-alleged-bribery/ |archive-date=1 March 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The dominant ethnic groups in Medan are [[Batak (Indonesia)|Batak]]  and [[Javanese people|Javanese]], with smaller [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malays]], [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]], [[Indian Indonesians|Indian]], [[Nias people|Nias]], and [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] populations.<ref name="leo">Leo Suryadinata, Evi Nurvidya Arifin, Aris Ananta, Indonesia's Population: ethnicity and religion in a changing political landscape, Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 2003.</ref>

[[File:Tortor.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bataks]] is the majority ethnic in Medan.]]
The [[Batak|Bataks]] in Medan are of three subethnicities. The native [[Batak Karo|Karo]] mostly live in the southern parts of Medan, including Padang Bulan, Medan Johor and Tuntungan. The [[Toba Batak people|Toba]], whom the Dutch employed on their oil palm plantations, live in Marindal and Amplas, or in nearby city centres such as the Medan Perjuangan district. Finally, the [[Mandailing]], who migrated to Medan after Indonesian independence in search of job opportunities, mainly live in Medan Tembung. The primary languages spoken by Bataks in Medan are [[Batak language|Batak]] and [[Karo language (Indonesia)|Karo]].

The large [[Javanese people|Javanese]] community in Medan is primarily composed of the descendants of people transported from Java in the 19th century to be employed as contract workers at various plantations in [[North Sumatra]]. For the most part, they speak the local dialect of [[Javanese language|Javanese]].

The [[Malay Indonesian|Malays]] are also natives of Medan, having lived as fishermen in the outskirts of the city since the [[Aru Kingdom|Aru]] era. Starting in the 18th century, they began to spread throughout the city, with large numbers living in Medan Maimun, Kota Matsum, Labuhan and Belawan and speaking [[Malay language|Malay]].

Immigration from southern China to Deli began in the 16th century, and accelerated in the 19th and early 20th centuries as immigrants sought employment as planters and coolies. Medan is home to the largest [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]] population in Sumatra, mostly concentrated around the city centre. Most Chinese people in Medan speak [[Medan Hokkien]], a local dialect, but many also speak [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], or [[Cantonese]].

[[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] came to Medan since the late of the 19th century. Minangs migration surged from the 1960s to the 1980s, becoming 10.9% of the population and founding [[Padang cuisine|Padang restaurants]] throughout the city. Most Minangkabau people in Medan speak [[Minangkabau language|Minangkabau]]. They are mostly concentrated around the city centre, near Central Market (''Pajak Sentral''), Kota Matsum and Sukaramai.<ref>Usman Pelly, Urbanisasi dan Adaptasi: Peranan Misi Budaya Minangkabau dan Mandailing, LP3ES, 1994</ref> 

Many [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] sought sanctuary in Medan after the [[insurgency in Aceh]] in the late 1970s. They now own a number of [[Mie aceh|Mie Aceh]] restaurants around the Setia Budi and Sunggal areas. Most speak [[Acehnese language|Acehnese]], and [[Gayo language|Gayonese]] is also common.

Medan also has a substantial [[Tamil Indonesian]] community. [[Kampung Madras]], a busy area in the city centre, is well-known as a Tamil neighbourhood.

The different linguistic communities in Medan communicate in a slang called ''Bahasa Medan'' or ''Dialek Medan'' (''Medanese slang''). This dialect of Indonesian includes loanwords from the various local languages, especially Malay.

===Seaport===
{{Main|Belawan}}
[[File:Terminal Penumpang Bandar Deli (preview).jpg|thumb|right|220px|The ''Bandar Deli'' terminal in Belawan]]

The [[Belawan|Port of Belawan]] is on the northeast coast of Sumatra, {{convert|19|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Medan and accessible by a railway across the channel south of the island.<ref>{{cite web |title=Belawan |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/59159/Belawan |publisher=britannica |access-date=19 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129104853/https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/59159/Belawan |archive-date=29 November 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> Originally built in 1890 for European tobacco exports, the harbour was expanded in 1907 with a new section for Chinese and indigenous traders.

The growth of northern Sumatra's rubber and palm oil plantations in the early twentieth century brought new developments to the port. Several major berthing facilities were built in the 1920s, and by 1938 the port handled the greatest cargo value of any in the Dutch East Indies. Trade volumes dropped substantially after Indonesian independence, but reached pre-independence levels again in the mid-1960s. A major restructuring in 1985 saw the construction of a container terminal; it almost immediately captured about one-fifth of Indonesia's containerized exports. Major products exported include rubber, palm oil, tea, and coffee.<ref>{{cite web |title=Port of Medan/Belawan |url=http://seaport.homestead.com/files/belawan.html |publisher=seaport.homestad |access-date=19 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520204902/http://seaport.homestead.com/files/belawan.html |archive-date=20 May 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The current port has two terminals. The first, which handles passengers, offers [[ferry]] services to cities including Penang, [[Langkawi]], [[Batam]], Jakarta, and Surabaya. The second, Belawan International Container Terminal (BICT), is used for export and import services, and is one of the largest shipping industry ports in Indonesia.

===Roads===
