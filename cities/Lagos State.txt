'''Lagos State''' ({{langx|yo|Ìpínlẹ̀ Èkó}}, {{langx|guw|Ayìmátẹ̀n Awọnlìn tọ̀n}}) is a [[States of Nigeria|state]] in [[South West (Nigeria)|southwestern]] [[Nigeria]]. Of the 36 [[States of Nigeria|Nigerian states]], it is the second [[List of Nigerian states by population|most populous state]] but the [[List of Nigerian states by area|smallest in area]]. Bounded to the south by the [[Bight of Benin]] and to the west by the [[Benin–Nigeria border|international border]] with [[Benin]] for 10&nbsp;km, Lagos State borders [[Ogun State]] to the north for about 283&nbsp;km, making it the only Nigerian state to border only one other state. Named for the city of [[Lagos]]—the [[List of urban areas in Africa by population|most populous city in Africa]]—the state was formed from the [[Western Region, Nigeria|Western Region]] and the former Federal Capital Territory on 27 May 1967.<ref name=":32">{{cite web |last1=Onyeakagbu |first1=Adaobi |title=See how all the 36 Nigerian states got their names |url=https://www.pulse.ng/lifestyle/food-travel/see-how-all-the-36-nigerian-states-got-their-names/g8bkn2c |access-date=25 December 2021 |website=Pulse.ng}}</ref><ref name="Creation2">{{cite web |date=24 October 2017 |title=This is how the 36 states were created |url=https://www.pulse.ng/news/local/nigerian-states-this-is-how-the-36-states-were-created/mdtnq3e |access-date=22 December 2021 |website=Pulse.ng}}</ref>

Lagos State has been inhabited for years by various indigenous ethnic groups, primarily the majority [[Yoruba people]] that live throughout the state but also the [[Ewe people|Ewe]] and [[Ogu people|Ogu]] peoples in the far west. As a result of migration since the nineteenth century, Lagos State also has large populations of non-native Nigerian ethnic groups with [[Edo people|Edo]], [[Fula people|Fulani]], [[Hausa people|Hausa]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]], [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]], [[Efik people|Efik]], and [[Nupe people|Nupe]] peoples among other Nigerian groups. There are also groups from outside of Nigeria's modern borders with the [[Saro people|Saro (Sierra Leonean)]] and [[Brazilians in Nigeria|Amaro (Brazilian)]] groups being descendants of [[Freedman|formerly enslaved people]] that returned to Africa in the 1800s with a longstanding Middle Eastern Nigerian community (mainly Syrian and [[Lebanese Nigerians]])<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lagos Population 2022 (Demographics, Maps, Graphs) |url=https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/lagos-population |access-date=2022-07-23 |website=worldpopulationreview.com}}</ref> also forming a significant part of Lagos' population along with recent immigrants from [[Benin Republic|Benin]], [[Chinese people in Nigeria|China]], [[Ghana]], [[India]], [[Togo]], and the [[British Nigerian|United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Adeshokan |first1=Oluwatosin |title=The last French speakers in Lagos |url=https://mg.co.za/article/2020-01-10-00-the-last-french-speakers-in-lagos/ |website=[[Mail & Guardian]] |access-date=3 January 2022 |date=10 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=In Nigeria, Chinatown Vendors Struggle For Profits |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/06/15/137045110/in-nigeria-chinatown-vendors-struggle-for-profits |website=[[NPR]] |access-date=3 January 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Fawehinmi |first1=Yolanthe |title=Meet the British-Nigerians swapping London for 'Africa's Silicon Valley' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/life/meet-british-nigerians-swapping-london-africas-silicon-valley/ |website=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=26 October 2021 |access-date=3 January 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Ndukwe |first1=Ijeoma |title='Everyone is hustling here': The Lebanese of Nigeria |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2017/1/28/everyone-is-hustling-here-the-lebanese-of-nigeria |website=[[Al Jazeera English|Al Jazeera]] |access-date=2 January 2022}}</ref> Religiously, the state is also diverse, as there is a sizable number of [[Christian]], [[Muslim]] and [[Traditional African religions|traditional ethnic religions]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-02-18 |title=Lagos, Nigeria's mega city where shrines compete with churches, mosques |url=https://punchng.com/lagos-nigerias-mega-city-shrines-compete-churches-mosques/ |access-date=2022-07-25 |website=Punch Newspapers |language=en-US}}</ref>

Ten years later, the forced [[Lagos Treaty of Cession]] led to the formal establishment of the [[Lagos Colony]]. In 1906, the colony was incorporated into the new [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate]] which merged into [[British Nigeria]] in 1914 with the city of [[Lagos]] as its capital. Upon independence in 1960, Lagos remained as the capital with much of the city forming the Federal Capital Territory while the rest of modern-day Lagos State was a part of the [[Western Region, Nigeria|Western Region]] until 1967 when the region was split and the area became Lagos State.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lagos: From British Colony to Federating State - THISDAYLIVE |url=https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2017/05/30/lagos-from-british-colony-to-federating-state |access-date=2023-07-12 |website=www.thisdaylive.com}}</ref>

Before the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] name of Lagos had been adopted, Lagos' initial name was Eko which referred mainly to the [[Island]]. The first to settle in Eko were the [[Awori tribe|Awori]]s in the 15th century and the [[Edo people|Bini]]s in the 16th century. The [[Awori tribe|Awori]]s were conquered by the [[Benin Empire]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fwc5AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA15|title=The Yoruba Today |author=Jeremy Seymour Eades|publisher=Cambridge University Press (Changing Culture Series)|page=15|year= 1980|isbn=9780521226561}}</ref> The Awori hunters and fishermen had originally come from [[Ife|Ile-Ife]] to the coast.<ref name="Lagos State, Nigeria">{{cite web|url=http://www.ngex.com/nigeria/places/states/lagos.htm |title=Lagos State, Nigeria |access-date=2014-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lagosstate.gov.ng/pagelinks.php?p=8|title=History of Lagos State|access-date=2014-03-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209151402/http://www.lagosstate.gov.ng/pagelinks.php?p=8|archive-date=9 February 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Government==
{{Main|Politics of Lagos State}}

Since its creation in 1967, the state has been administered either by a [[List of Governors of Lagos State|governor]] and a [[Lagos State House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] in civilian or quasi-civilian (under [[Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida]]'s administration) federal administrations, or by Sole-Administrators or Military Administrators in military dispensations. Since December 2007, [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] has been the second official language of debate and discussion for the [[House of Assembly]] after English. The House of Assembly is headed by [[Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly|the Speaker]], an elected position which is currently held by Mudashiru Obasa, who has also won his party's ticket to run for a 6th term in the upcoming 2023 elections.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bankole |first=Idowu |date=2022-05-27 |title=Lagos Speaker Obasa wins APC ticket for 6th term |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/05/lagos-speaker-obasa-wins-apc-ticket-for-6th-term/ |access-date=2022-10-05 |website=Vanguard News |language=en-GB}}</ref>

=== Politics ===
The State government is led by a democratically elected governor who works closely with members of the state's house of assembly. The Capital city of the State is Ikeja.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Oguntola |first=Tunde |date=2022-09-27 |title=2023: Next President, Govs Must Get Two-thirds Spread, Says INEC |url=https://leadership.ng/2023-next-president-govs-must-get-two-thirds-spread-says-inec/ |access-date=2023-02-23 |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Electoral System==

The electoral system of each state is selected using a modified two-round system. To be elected in the first round, a candidate must receive the plurality of the vote and over 25% of the vote in at least two -third of the State local government Areas. If no candidate passes threshold, a second round will be held between the top candidate and the next candidate to have received a plurality of votes in the highest number of local government areas.<ref>[https://leadership.ng/2023-next-president-govs-must-get-two-thirds-spread-says-inec/ Next President, Govs must get two thirds spread says INEC.
