==History==

===Name and origins===
The original name of the city was '''Gladbach''', by which it is still often known today. To distinguish it from another town of the same name (the present [[Bergisch Gladbach]]), it took the name '''München-Gladbach''' (“Monks’ Gladbach”, in reference to the abbey<ref>{{cite web |title=Monchengladbach |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Monchengladbach |website=Britannica.com |access-date=30 March 2024}}</ref>) in 1888. Between 1933 and 1950, it was written '''München Gladbach''' (short: '''M. Gladbach'''), without a hyphen. This spelling was seen as potentially misleading, as it could imply that Gladbach was a borough of [[Munich]] (''München'' in [[German language|German]]), so consequently the name was changed to Mönchen-Gladbach in 1950 (and subsequently Mönchengladbach in 1960) to avoid confusion.

The town was founded around [[Gladbach Abbey]] in 974. It was named after the Gladbach, a narrow brook which mostly runs underground today. The abbey and adjoining villages became a town in the 14th century. The town of [[Rheydt]] is located nearby and is incorporated into Mönchengladbach today.

===Early history===
The first settlements in the area of Mönchengladbach are approximately 300,000–400,000 years old and show remains of [[Homo erectus]] and [[Neanderthal]]. There are numerous [[cairn]]s from the [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]]s.

The history of Mönchengladbach began with the construction of the Gladbach Minster and the founding of an abbey in the year 974 by [[Gero, Archbishop of Cologne]], and his companion, the monk Sandrad of [[Archbishopric of Trier|Trier]].

To improve the settlement, the monks created a market north of the church in the 12th century. Craftsmen settled near the market. Gladbach received its [[German town law|town charter]] in 1364–1366. The "town" erected a town wall made of stone, which had to be maintained by the citizens. Remains of the wall can be found at the Geroweiher, as can remains of the "Thick Tower", an old fortified tower at the Waldhausener hill. Until the end of the 18th century, the city belonged to the department of [[Grevenbroich]] within the [[duchy of Jülich]].

On 4 October 1794, the armed forces of the [[French Revolution]] marched into the town, one day before the fortress Jülich had been handed over. When the Holy Roman Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] ceded the left bank of the river [[Rhine]] to France with the [[Treaty of Lunéville]] in 1801, Gladbach fell under French laws suppressing religion. This was the end for the abbey, and the monastery was closed. On 31 October 1802, the last 31 monks left the monastery. The contents of the tremendous abbey library, well known outside Germany, were scattered or destroyed.

From 1798 until 1814, the ''[[Mairie]]'' Gladbach was part of ''[[Canton (country subdivision)|Canton]]'' Odenkirchen, of the ''[[Arrondissement]]'' Krefeld, of the [[Roer (department)|Roer]] ''[[Département]]''.

===Recent history===
In 1815, Gladbach became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and seat of the [[Gladbach (district)|Landkreis Gladbach]], which was dissolved in 1929. In 1815 Gladbach became seat of the Bürgermeisterei (Office of mayor), which was split in 1859 into two parts: the City of Gladbach and Office of Mayor Obergeburth. The latter was renamed to München-Gladbach-Land in 1907.

From 1933 through 1975, the neighborhood of [[Rheydt]] was an independent city; the split from München-Gladbach was arranged by [[Joseph Goebbels]], who was born locally. After reuniting with Mönchengladbach, the central station ([[Rheydt Hauptbahnhof]]) kept its original name, making Mönchengladbach the only city in Germany to have two rail stations each called Hauptbahnhof.

In response to the 10 May 1940 [[German invasion of Belgium (1940)|German invasion of Belgium]], Mönchengladbach was bombed by [[RAF Bomber Command]] on the evening of 11 May. The bomber crews were attempting to interdict German troop movements on roads, intersections and rail lines in the area, especially the city's railyards. About half of the approximately 36 twin-engine [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) bombers reportedly hit their targets, and three were shot down.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZePSUx1FsgC&pg=PT27 |page=27 |title=Among the Dead Cities: Is the Targeting of Civilians in War Ever Justified? |last=Grayling |first=A.

Eventually, the Prussian [[Rhine Province]] was dissolved after [[World War II]], and the city became part of the new state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] which was formed in 1946.

==Economy==
[[File:Hugo Junkers Hangar.jpg|thumb|left|Hugo Junkers Hangar, aviation and event facility]]
Mönchengladbach's industrial ascent was mainly influenced by the development of the textile industry from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century. In addition, a textile-oriented machine industry also developed.

After the Second World War, a major structural change began, reducing the importance of the textile industry and attracting new economic sectors. At present, only 7 percent of employees work in the once dominant textile and clothing industry (for example: ''Van Laack'' and ''gardeur'').

As part of the successful diversification of the business location, local government and representatives founded the Mönchengladbach Business Development Corporation (WFMG) in 1997. WFMG and the University of Applied Sciences Niederrhein have developed a five-pillar model for the future orientation of the business location. Thereafter textile and fashion, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering, logistics, the creative industry and the health sector are the leading sectors for the economic future of the city of Mönchengladbach. As part of an active cluster policy, the WFMG has partly initiated its own networks for these industries.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wfmg.de/english.html |title=English - WFMG - Wirtschaftsförderung Mönchengladbach GMBH |access-date=4 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705003902/https://www.wfmg.de/english.html |archive-date=5 July 2018 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

The most important employer in Mönchengladbach is the [[Banco Santander|Santander Consumer Bank]], which has its headquarters at Aachener Straße in Mönchengladbach's city center.

The economic structure includes: [[Machine tool|tool]] and [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] machines (Dörries Scharmann, Monforts, Trützschler, Schlafhorst), automatic conveyor systems, signal and system technology (Scheidt & Bachmann), transformers (SMS Meer), cables ([[Nexans]] Germany formerly Kabelwerk Rheydt), printed matter and foodstuffs.

[[Chocolatier]] Heinemann is known beyond the city limits for his cakes, pralines and baked goods, which he offers in cafés on site as well as in [[Düsseldorf]] and [[Munich]]. Furthermore, [[beer]] breweries are represented in Mönchengladbach. The Oettinger brewery produces at the site of the former Hannen brewery. The Hensen brewery has been producing a lower Rhine-type Altbier since 2015 at the former [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]] of the river Gladbach in the Waldhausen district.

Especially in the 1970s and 1980s nightlife was attractive to young party people from Düsseldorf. In the meantime, [[tourism]] in particular is playing a certain role. Mönchengladbach has about 40 hotels (for example: Hotel Burgund) and inns as well as a [[youth hostel]] in the district Hardter Wald. In total there are about 2000 beds. The number of overnight stays is over 200,000 annually.

[[Mönchengladbach Airport]] is dominated by general aviation. There are currently no scheduled services to and from Mönchengladbach. Additionally, there are few business-charter passenger flights. In June 2015 ''Hugo Junkers Hangar'' was opened as an aviation and event facility. Airplane enthusiasts can book sightseeing flights with [[Junkers Ju 52]] from the 1940s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ju52rundflug.de/ |title=Ju 52 Rundflüge – Ein tolles Erlebnis für groß und klein – Eine weitere WordPress-Website |publisher=Ju 52rundflug.de |date=13 June 2018 |access-date=21 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://hugo-junkers-hangar.de/ |title=Hugo Junkers Hangar Home - Hugo Junkers Hangar |access-date=4 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823034419/https://hugo-junkers-hangar.de/ |archive-date=23 August 2018 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The next major international airport [[Düsseldorf Airport]] is only 20 kilometres (12&nbsp;mi) away to the east.
