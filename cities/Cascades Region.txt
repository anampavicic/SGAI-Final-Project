==Geography==
Most of Burkina Faso is a wide plateau formed by riverine systems and is called falaise de Banfora. There are three major rivers, the [[Red Volta]], [[Black Volta]] and [[White Volta]], which cuts through different valleys. The climate is generally hot, with unreliable rains across different seasons. Gold and quartz are common minerals found across the country, while [[manganese]] deposits are also common.<ref name=geo/> The dry season is usually from October to May and rains are common during the wet season from June to September. The soil texture is porous and hence the yield is also poor.<ref>{{cite book|title=Living Geography: Homework and Assessment, Book 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3gKz5wH51aEC&q=burkinafaso+geography&pg=PA29|page=29|first1=James C. |last1=Dobson|first2= John M. |last2=Sander|last3=Woodfield|first3= Judith|publisher=Nelson Thornes|year=2001|isbn=9780174343257 }}</ref> The average elevation is around {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} above mean sea level. The region contains [[Mount Tenakourou]], which is the country's highest peak with an elevation of {{convert|747|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Among West African countries, Burkina Faso has the largest elephant population and the country is replete with game reserves.<ref name=geo1>{{cite book|title=Burkina Faso Mining Laws and Regulations Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RW-DF0PY7i8C&q=burkinafaso+geography&pg=PA19|page=19|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|year=2008|isbn=9781433077074}}</ref> The southern regions are more tropical in nature and have [[savannah]] and forests. The principal river is the Black Volta, that originates in the southern region and drains into [[Ghana]]. The areas near the rivers usually have flies like [[tsetse]] and similium, which are carriers of sleep sickness and river blindness.<ref name=geo>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Geography, Volume 17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pR1Pszc1mVgC&q=burkinafaso+geography&pg=PA2321|editor1-first= Peter |editor1-last=Haggett|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=2002|isbn=9780761473060}}</ref> The average rainfall in the region is around {{convert|100|cm|in|abbr=on}} compared to northern regions that receive only {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} rainfall.<ref name=geo1/>

Burkina Faso gained independence from France in 1960. It was originally called Upper Volta. There have been military coups till 1983 when Captain Thomas Sankara took control and implemented radical left wing policies. He was ousted by Blaise Compaore, who continued for 27 years till 2014, when a popular uprising ended his rule.<ref>{{cite web|title=Burkina Faso country profile|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13754897|date=5 August 2016|access-date=20 November 2016|publisher=BBC}}</ref> As per Law No.40/98/AN in 1998, Burkina Faso adhered to decentralization to provide administrative and financial autonomy to local communities. There are 13 administrative regions, each governed by a Governor. The regions are subdivided into 45 provinces, which are further subdivided into 351 communes. The communes may be urban or rural and are interchangeable. There are other administrative entities like department and village. An urban commune has typically 10,000 people under it. If any commune is not able to get 75 per cent of its planned budget in revenues for 3 years, the autonomy is taken off. The communes are administered by elected Mayors. The communes are stipulated to develop economic, social and cultural values of its citizens. A commune has financial autonomy and can interact with other communes, government agencies or international entities.<ref>{{cite report|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un/unpan023252.pdf|page=9|title=Republic of Burkina Faso, Public Administration and Country profile|access-date=17 November 2016|publisher=Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), United Nations|year=2004|date=|archive-date=7 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207064424/http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un/unpan023252.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>
