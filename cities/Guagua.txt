'''Guagua''', officially the '''Municipality of Guagua''' ({{langx|pam|Balen ning Guagua}}; {{langx|tl|Bayan ng Guagua}}), is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Pampanga]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 128,893 people.{{PH census|current}}

==Etymology==
''Wawa'', which means "river mouth" ([[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]]: ''alua'' or ''bukana''), was the earliest recorded form of the town's name according to records dating back to 1590. The town is strategically located along a river which played a vital role in trade and transportation during the [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|precolonial era]].

Wawa was already a prosperous settlement when [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonists]] took control of the town in the year 1561, from then on calling it ''Guagua'', which is a [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Hispanised]] form of the original name. Indeed, archeological artifacts have been excavated in a nearby town which affirmed the existence of a prehistoric community in Guagua.

==History==
===Early history===
Early inhabitants opted to stay in the town because it was here that they could engage in barter trade with people from different islands, along with other means of livelihood like fishing and farming. The navigable river with which the town was endowed allowed shipping vessels to transport commodities to and from other chief localities, particularly the imperial Manila.

===Spanish colonial era===
The first cargo boat to arrive in Guagua was the ''Doña Dominga'' on May 7, 1884. Much later it was followed by the steamships ''Kaibigan'' and ''Kababayan'', which anchored at the pier in Bgy Santo Niño, better known as the Yañgco Landing.

In 1892, when the Manila–Mabalacat railroad was inaugurated, Guagua was virtually the port of embarkation to and from Manila that served the province. The [[Chinese Filipino|Chinese]] have long been part in Guagua's social and economic mainstream.

In the 18th century, they sought refuge in the town to escape [[Sinophobia|discrimination and persecution]] in [[Manila]]. After their near-total [[Genocide|slaughter]], the Chinese lived in relative peace while they freely practiced their craft and mingled hand-in-hand with the local residents. The Chinese residents were merchants, masons, woodcarvers, carpenters, agriculturists and labourers. Their influence on the cultural and economic life of Guagua cannot be overlooked. The town could not have prospered so well without the economic services provided by the Chinese.

The town took significant part in the revolutionary struggles against the foreign intruders. A house near a church was made a secret cell of the Katipuneros in August 1897.

In March 1898, a massacre of all Spanish sympathisers in Guagua marked the end of [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish colonialism]] and the outset of [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American rule]]. Moreover, during the [[Philippine–American War]] and the ensuing [[Second World War]], Guagua became an important battleground.

===American invasion era===
At the turn of the twentieth century, a new system of education was introduced and made popular and available to the Filipinos.  The Guagua Elementary School in Barangay Santa Filomena, is believed to be the first to be established in the town in the year 1901. Later in that year, an English teacher came to Betis district and opened a primary school which functioned on a regular basis. During that period, the town of Betis to the east was abolished, turning into a township of Guagua.

In 1908, ''Colegio del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús'' (now Saint Mary's Academy) in Barangay San Roque was established in a two-storey building in downtown, donated by a charitable matron.

Commerce was further improved when the San Fernando–Guagua line of the railroad was chartered on November 17, 1907.

Later in 1918, Guagua National Institute (now Guagua National Colleges) in Barangay Santa Filomena was founded in the ''[[Clergy house|convento]]'' of the local church. Further, in 1941, the then-[[Parish|parish priest]] felt the need for another high school in town, so he opened Saint Michael's College.

===Philippine independence===
In November 1959, nine rural barrios (now barangays) of Guagua were granted a 50-year electrification franchise, with the electricity provided by the [[National Power Corporation]].<ref name="TMT">{{cite news|title=Guagua town to get power|work=[[The Manila Times]]|publisher=The Manila Times Publishing Company, Inc.|date=November 6, 1959|page=2-A|quote=The barrios to be served are San Matias, San Jose, Natividad, Ebus, Lambac, Pulungmasle, Maquiapo, Rizal and Siram.}}</ref>

At the [[People Power Revolution|overthrow]] of the [[History of the Philippines (1965–1986)|Marcos dictatorship]] in 1986, the local government carried out a sustainable development program to address the town's destitute state. From its income classification in 1986 as a third-class municipality, Guagua grew to a first-class one. Guagua garnered several outstanding citations for its achievement, including of several "Most Outstanding LGU" awards.

Guagua was severely devastated by the eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in 1991.

==Geography==
Guagua is bounded on the north by the towns of Bacolor and Santa Rita; on the south by the towns of Sasmuan and Lubao; on the east, Macabebe and Sasmuan; and on the west, Porac and Floridablanca.

It is {{convert|10|km}} from the capital city of [[San Fernando, Pampanga|San Fernando]], {{convert|27|km}} from [[Angeles City]], and {{convert|76|km}} from [[Metro Manila]]. 

===Topography===
The town is mostly flat and is suitable to any kind of development; agricultural, industrial, commercial and others.  It is only a meter above sea level.

===Soil type===
In general, the soils of Guagua are of recent alluvial origin consisting of fine sand, silt loam and hydrosol.  The average chemical analysis of its top soils is : nitrogen, 0.02 to 0.1; phosphorus, 0.06 to 0.28; potassium, 0.46 to 1.74; organic carbon, 0.41 to 3.02; and pH value (acidity and alkalinity), 5.61 to 6.99.

===Flora and fauna===
The climate and topographical features of the vast land of Guagua make it ideal for the growing of fruit trees and vegetables.  Among the fruit trees most fitting to be planted are mangoes, guavas, santol, star apples, and bananas.  For vegetables, sitao, upo, ampalaya, gabi and cucumber are the most commonly produced by farmers and which thrive best in the community.

Being void of forest areas, its fauna are mostly the domesticated ones like, chicken, ducks, cattle, and others.

It is a Spanish-era church declared a National Cultural Treasure by the [[National Museum of the Philippines]] and the NCCA (under R.A. 4896 as amended by P.D. 374 and R.A. 8492), on November 5, 2001 (one of only 26 churches in the country bestowed that honor).

===Immaculate Conception Parish Church===
{{main|Immaculate Conception Church (Guagua)}}

The first church edifice was constructed in 1587 but was unfortunately razed by fire. The current Church structure was constructed in 1772 under the administration of the Augustinians. The Church was greatly improved in 1862 until 1870. The interiors are simple and the centerpiece attraction is the main altar, a creation of noted local artist Willy Layug. While still simple, the exteriors on the other hand, are marked by massive strength. The Cathedral-type church is located immediately adjacent to the Guagua Municipal Building and houses the Cardinal Santos Catholic Center and the Immaculate Conception Parochial School.
