==History==
[[File:RemnantPaintCupolaSanMarcosTuxtla.JPG|thumb|left|Remnants of frescos at the Saint Mark's Cathedral]]
[[File:Tuxtla05.jpg|thumb|left|Old City Hall, currently the City Museum]]
The [[Zoque people|Zoques]] made the first pre-Hispanic settlement at the site. They named the valley area name ''Coyatoc'', which means 'land or house of rabbits'. The [[Aztec]]s intruded into the area between 1486 and 1505 and named it ''Tuchtlan'', which means the same thing in their language.<ref name="encmuc"/>

After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], and the subjugation of the local Chiapan people in 1528, the [[Dominican order|Dominicans]] constructed a monastery in nearby [[Tecpatán]].<ref name="chiapasgob"/> There is no official founding date for Tuxtla, but it is known that the Dominican monks gathered dispersed Zoques into communities organized around churches in the 16th Century. A church dedicated to San Marcos (Saint Mark) was founded by the Dominicans for one of these communities in 1560.<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="palaciomuni"/> While Tuxtla is much relegated in regional history against [[Comitán|Comitán Domínguez]] and [[San Cristóbal de las Casas|San Cristóbal]] in Mexican official historiography, haves a really giant amount of adobes,<ref name="Extinguirse">{{cite web |last1=Leyte |first1=Lizbeth |title=Adobe and culturally valuable houses almost extinction |url=https://www.meganoticias.mx/tuxtla-gutierrez/noticia/casas-de-adobe-y-valor-cultural-a-punto-de-extinguirse/506544 |website=meganoticias.mx |publisher=Meganoticias |access-date=19 June 2024}}</ref> including Spanish colonial in downtown and west areas around Señor del Cerrito Hermitage, from 19th century in downtown area limits and far south and north areas and traces of a Zoquean migration during 19th century in west and far southwest areas.<ref name="Extinguirse"></ref> State capital houses around 800 adobes,<ref name="Extinguirse"></ref> many times much more than any officially-declared historic site in Chiapas.

The existence of the town of San Marcos Tuxtla was first recorded in 1748, and by 1768 it became the seat of a mayoralty in Chiapas.<ref name="Municipio de Tuxtla Gutiérrez" />

The village was officially recognized as a villa by [[King of Spain]] in 1813 with a population of about 5,000, three-quarters of which were Zoques.<ref name="palaciomuni"/> In 1821, the authorities of the villa proclaimed independence from both Spain and the regional colonial government of [[Guatemala]], along with other areas in what would become Chiapas. However, this declaration was not accepted by either Guatemala or [[Mexico]]. Tuxtla, along with the state of Chiapas, became part of Mexico by popular voting on {{dts|September 14, 1824}}.

Tuxtla was officially renamed as Tuxtla Gutiérrez on {{dts|May 31, 1848}} by governor Fernando Nicolás Maldonado to honor [[:es:Joaquín Miguel Gutiérrez|Joaquín Miguel Gutiérrez]], a former governor of Chiapas that promoted the state annexation to Mexico.<ref name="palaciomuni">{{cite web |url=http://www.conecultachiapas.gob.mx/paginas |title=El Palacio Municipal de Tuxtla Gutiérrez, 1942. |year=2008 |publisher=Coneculta-Chiapas |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=The Municipal Palace of Tuxtla Gutiérrez |access-date=May 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503072619/http://www.conecultachiapas.gob.mx/paginas/ |archive-date=May 3, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The municipality was first incorporated as a {{Lang|es|departamento}} on {{dts|March 31, 1849}}.<ref name=dates>{{cite book |date=1996 |title=Estado de Chiapas División Territorial de 1810 a 1995. |pages=79–95 |url= http://internet.contenidos.inegi.org.mx/contenidos/productos/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/historicos/2104/702825222338/702825222338_9.pdf |language=es |location=Mexico |publisher=INEGI |isbn=970-13-1486-7}}</ref> It replaced [[San Cristóbal de las Casas]] as the capital of Chiapas on {{dts|August 11, 1892}}.

The first library in the state was founded here in 1910.<ref name="encmuc"/>

During the [[Mexican Revolution]], a battalion called "The Sons of Tuxtla" was formed in 1911, with Captain Julio Miramontes assassinated in 1912. Troops supporting [[Venustiano Carranza]] took over in 1914, led by Agustín Castro. Chiapas was reorganized into the municipality system in 1915, Tuxtla Gutiérrez becoming the head of one of these and Noé Vázquez the first municipal president. The city remained the state capital. The reaction against Carranza's policies was headed by the Mapaches, a group of landholders in the state who objected to the loss of their privileges and the redistribution of their lands. They burned the state government building, destroying its archives in 1915. General Salvador Alvarado and 2500 troops fought the Mapaches commanded by General Tiburcio Fernández Ruiz.<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="palaciomuni"/> Catholic churches were closed and images of saints were burned in the city in 1934.<ref name="encmuc"/>

In 1941, the municipal government moved from the old building on El Triunfo Street in the Santo Domingo neighborhood to the corner of Avenida Central and Calle 2ª Poniente on lands that belonged to the city's first municipal president. Here a new municipal palace was built in Neoclassical style. However, the municipal palace was moved again to its current location in 1982, and the Neoclassical building was given to the {{Lang|es|Federación de Trabajadores del Estado de Chiapas|italic=no}}.<ref name="palaciomuni"/>

The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tuxtla|Diocese of Tuxtla]] was created in 1965, which elevated the parish of San Marcos (Saint Mark) to a cathedral. It was subsequently elevated to an archdiocese in 2010.<ref name="encmuc"/> The city experienced high rates of population growth from the 1970s, resulting in the annexation of the municipality of Terán in 1973. The first Feria de Chiapas was held in 1980, and the Pope [[John Paul II]] visited the city in 1990.<ref name="encmuc"/>

During the 1990s, some areas of the state of Chiapas were affected by the [[Zapatista uprising|EZLN or Zapatista uprising]]. While most of this group's activity was in rural areas of the state, Tuxtla was also affected by it. As many as 10,000 Zapatista sympathizers protested in the city in 1998 to push federal officials to honor the 1994 [[San Andrés Accords]] and to push for new gubernatorial elections and other demands.<ref name="marchan">{{cite news |title= Marchan miles en Tuxtla |author= Daniel Pensamiento |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=March 23, 1998 |page=17 |language=es |trans-title=Thousands march in Tuxtla}}</ref> The political instability pushed many indigenous into the municipality from more rural areas in the latter half of the decade.<ref name="burguete"/> In 1998, PRD politician, EZLN activist and leader of the {{Lang|es|Asamblea Estatal Democrática del Pueblo Chiapaneco Rubicel|italic=no}} Ruiz Gamboa was assassinated in the city.

The zoo is especially known for its work in preserving the quetzal, being the first to breed the bird in captivity in the 1970s. The design of the zoo respects the topography of the zone and only exhibits regional wildlife. It contains 1,400 animals from 220 species including [[jaguar]]s, [[tapir]]s, [[macaw]]s, [[spider monkey]]s, [[howler monkey]]s and [[quetzal]]s. Over 150 of the species freely roam in natural enclosures and in some areas, animals such as [[deer]], [[iguana]]s, small reptiles and birds come very close to the areas where humans pass. Sixty of the species exhibited here are in danger of extinction, including the jaguar, the [[ocelot]], the macaw, the quetzal, and howler monkey.<ref name="puerta"/>

==Metropolitan area==

According to Mexico's National Council on Population (CONAPO), the metropolitan area of Tuxtla Gutiérrez is formed by five municipalities, two core and three peripheral. It is anchored by the contiguous urban area of the cities of Tuxtla Gutiérrez and Chiapa de Corzo. Berriozábal was added in 2010, and San Fernando and Suchiapa in 2015.<ref name="conapo2015">{{cite web|url=https://www.gob.mx/conapo/documentos/delimitacion-de-las-zonas-metropolitanas-de-mexico-2015|title=Delimitation of Mexico's Metropolitan Zones 2015|publisher=CONAPO|language=es|access-date=2020-12-29}}</ref>

According to the 2020 Census, the municipality had a total population of 604,147. The city of Tuxtla Gutiérrez, with 578,830 residents, is the 31st [[List of cities in Mexico#Top 100 Most Populous Cities|most populated city]] in the country.<ref name=INEGI>{{cite web|url=https://www.inegi.org.mx/app/scitel/Default?ev=9|title=Censo de Población y Vivienda 2020 - SCITEL|language=es|publisher=INEGI|access-date=2021-01-27}}</ref> The municipality had 125 localities, the largest of which were Copoya (9,868) and El Jobo (5,798), classified as urban.<ref name=INEGI />

Over half of the population of the Central Valley region of Chiapas lives in the city. Most are young, with 66% under the age of thirty and the average age of twenty three. The rate of population growth is about four percent, with the population expected to double in less than twenty years. 99.56% of the municipality's population lives in three urban areas with the rest scattered among 81 other rural communities. The population density is 1,053/km2 well above the regional average of 75/km2 and state 52/km2. The average woman has 2.27 children, below the regional average of 2.87 and the state average of 3.47. There is some immigration into the city, mostly from [[Veracruz]], [[State of Mexico]] and [[Mexico City]].<ref name="encmuc"/>

The population growth of the municipality has exceeded that of the state for the last five decades. From 1990 to 2000, the municipality has a growth rate of 3.95%, almost double the state average. However, the greatest rate of growth was between 1970 and 1980 when it was 8.6%. This population growth has led to high demands for lands, housing, infrastructure and services, with many not able to keep up, especially in low income areas, which is about 40% of the city.<ref name="burguete">{{Cite report |title= El comercio sexual en Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Chiapas. |url= http://ccp.ucr.ac.cr/noticias/migraif/pdf/burguete.pdf |author= Jorge Luis Cruz Burguete |author2=Patricia Elizabeth Almazán Esquivel |author3=Guadalupe Albores Castro |year=2010 |publisher= Centro Centroamericano de Población San José, Costa Rica |access-date=May 29, 2011  }}</ref> There are an estimated 15,000 cases of illegally tapping into the city's water distribution system, with an estimated loss of millions of pesos.

Just under eighty percent are Catholic with just over thirteen percent belonging to Protestant or other Christian groups.<ref name="encmuc"/>

Most of the population is [[mestizo]] with a significant population of ethnic [[Zoque people|Zoques]].<ref name="chiapasgob"/> Although about 25% of the state's population speaks an indigenous language, the percentage is much lower in the municipality of Tuxtla. As of 2005, there were 8,256 people who spoke an indigenous language out of a total population of 434,143.<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="burguete"/> The percentage of indigenous language speakers rose somewhat from 1995 to 2000 as many rural people moved into the area as a consequence of the Zapatista rebellion. This has added languages such as [[Tzotzil language|Tzotzil]], [[Tzeltal language|Tzeltal]], [[Zapotec languages|Zapotec]] and [[Ch'ol language|Ch'ol]] to the native [[Zoque languages|Zoque]].<ref name="burguete"/>

==Culture and gastronomy==
[[File:PepitacnTasajoCorzo.jpg|thumb|right|{{Lang|es|Pepita con tasajo}}]]
The two most important local celebrations are Saint Mark's Day and the [[Feria Chiapas]]. The {{Lang|es|Feria de San Marcos}} (Saint Mark's Fair) occurs each April in the center of the city, honoring the patron saint of [[Mark the Evangelist]]. It includes offerings, fireworks in frames called {{Lang|es|castillos}} (castles), and pilgrimages for four days starting on the 25th.<ref name="chiapasgob"/><ref name="mexdes"/> The Feria Chiapas includes [[bullfight]]s, horse racing, [[cockfighting|cockfights]] and exhibitions of the many products of the state, including crafts, manufactured goods and agricultural products. It is held on the next to last Sunday of November through the first Sunday of December.

The Zoque Carnival reflects the area's [[Zoque people|Zoque]] heritage. It includes a ritual called the "Virgin Mary's Descent" in Copoya: on January 30, local statues of the Virgin Mary are carried by foot from the Copoya church down to the Valley of Tuxtla. After staying in the city for two months, the statues are carried back up to the Copoya plateau.<ref name="chiapasgob"/>

Other important religious festivities in the municipality include San Roque, San Jacinto, San Pascualito, San Francisco, Santo Domingo and the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]].<ref name="encmuc"/>

Much of the cuisine of the municipality reflects that of the rest of the state and includes {{Lang|es-mx|pictes}} (a sweet corn [[tamale]]), {{Lang|es-mx|chispota}} (beef with chickpeas and cabbage), {{Lang|es-mx|niguijuti}} (pork with [[mole (sauce)|mole sauce]]), {{Lang|es|sopa de pan}} (bread with broth and vegetables), {{Lang|es|cochito}} (pork in [[adobo]] sauce), {{Lang|es-mx|chanfaina}} (lamb innards with rice), a legume called {{Lang|es|patashete}}, and traditional Chiapas tamales made with [[Crotalaria longirostrata|chipilín]]. Local drinks include ''[[pozol]]'', ''[[taxcalate]]'', {{Lang|es-mx|agua de chía tashiagual}} and {{Lang|es-mx|pinole}}.<ref name="chiapasgob"/><ref name="mexdes"/>

Other local specialties include {{Lang|es-mx|nucú}}, an edible ant that comes out at night during the rainy season, rich in proteins;<ref name=nucu>{{cite web|url=https://www.efe.com/efe/english/life/nucu-the-edible-ant-that-gives-mexico-a-tasty-rainy-season/50000263-4013584|title=Nucu, the edible ant that gives Mexico a tasty rainy season|publisher=Agencia EFE|access-date=March 11, 2021}}</ref> {{Lang|es|carnes parrilladas}}, grilled meat platters; and {{Lang|es|carne molida tártara}}, spicy ground meat cooked in lime juice with onions, tomatoes and cilantro, usually eaten in [[tostada (tortilla)|tostada]]s.<ref name="parttwo">{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/350-a-tourist-s-guide-to-tuxtla-gutierrez-chiapas-part-2 |title= A tourist's guide to Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas part 2  |author=Carron Harlan |date=January 1, 2000 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089  |access-date=May 29, 2011 }}</ref>

==Climate==
Tuxtla features a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] under the [[Köppen climate classification]]. With its relatively low altitude, the area has a hot and relatively humid climate with most rain falling in the summer.<ref name="chiapasgob"/> Except for a rainy and dry season (summer-fall and winter-spring respectively) there is little variation in the climate during the year. Even the distinction between the rainy and dry season is one of quantity of rain. Air conditioning is rare as most homes and offices use fans and most rooms and offices open into streets or courtyards. Most businesses close in the late afternoon from between 2:00 until 4:30 or 5:00 when it can get hot.<ref name="parttwo"/> Although it is not on the coast, it is close enough that hurricanes and tropical storms can affect it at time. In 2003, [[Tropical Storm Larry (2003)|Tropical Storm Larry]] caused flooding in the city, forcing the evacuation of 7,000 people.<ref name="larry">{{cite news |title= Anega 'Larry' a 7 mil en Tuxtla Gutierrez |author=Maria Teresa del Riego |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=October 7, 2003 |page=30 |language=es |trans-title=Larry dislodges 7,000 in Tuxtla Gutierrez }}</ref>

==Environment==
[[File:Tuxtlacentro.JPG|thumb|Tuxtla's airborne pollution have become moderate problems due to the city's fast growth rate and an increasing number of vehicles, as the high number of mountains]]
[[File:Tuxtla.jpg|thumb|Central Valley of Chiapas.]]

The city has an altitude of 600 meters above sea level and sits in the long narrow Tuxtla Valley, which is part of the larger Central Valley region of the state. On the north and south sides of the municipality, the land rises into mountainous terrain as one heads out of the valley.<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="parttwo"/>

There are three main rivers in the municipality, the [[Grijalva River|Grijalva]] or Grande de Chiapa, the [[Suchiapa River|Suchiapa]] and the [[Sabinal River|Sabinal]]. The last is severely polluted.<ref name="encmuc"/>

The natural vegetation of the area is lowland rainforest; however much has been cut down by logging and clearing for farmland and pasture. Most of the municipality's forest and wildlife is found in a number of reserves including the Centro Ecological Recreativo El Zapotal, the Cerro Mactumatzá State Reserve, the Vedada Villa Allende Protected Forest Zone, and the [[Sumidero Canyon National Park]]. The largest of these is Sumidero Canyon, established in 1980, which spreads out over 21,789.41 hectares in three other municipalities besides Tuxtla.

El Zapotal was created in 1990 and extends over 192.57 hectares completely within the municipality. It contains lowland rainforest, subtropical forest and some highland rainforest. All of these contain deciduous and perennial species. Cerro Mactumatzá was established in 1997 and with an area of 613.70 hectares within the municipality. It contains oak, [[Quercus agrifolia|holm oak]] and tropical forests and with some areas still containing old growth.<ref name="encmuc"/> Because of the rapid growth of the city, these green areas are under pressure. In 2011, over 200 illegal squatters were evicted from an area called {{Lang|es|El paraíso}}, inside an ecological reserve in the municipality. This settlement covered an area of ten hectares.<ref name="invasores">{{cite news |title= Desalojan reserva en Tuxtla Gutiérrez |author=Martín Morita |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=February 15, 2011 |page=22 |language=es |trans-title=Evicted from a reserve in Tuxtla Gutiérrez }}</ref>

==Education==
According to the 2010 Census, the rate of illiteracy was 5.4%,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/57945555/Indicadores-Relevantes-para-Chiapas-del-Censo-2010|title=Indicadores Relevantes para Chiapas del Censo 2010|website=Scribd}}</ref> down from 7.66% in 2000 and 10.68% in 1990. This is lower than the state average of 17.8%. Of those over the age of fifteen, just under fourteen percent have not finished primary school, just over fifteen percent have only completed primary school and the rest have gone beyond this level.<ref name="encmuc"/>

There are numerous universities and colleges as well as business and language schools.<ref name="partone"/> Higher education institutions include the Chiapas Campus of the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education]] and the Universidad Valle del Grijalva. The [[Tuxtla Gutierrez Institute of Technology]] (ITTG) was founded in the 1970s as the {{Lang|es|Instituto Tecnológico Regional|italic=no}}, offering programs in Internal Combustion Engines, Electricity, Laboratory Chemistry, and Machinery and Tools. Today, the school offers various university-level majors such as Industrial Engineering, Computer Systems, and Biochemistry. Since 1998, it has offered Masters in Biotechnology, Administration and Biochemical Engineering.<ref name="instectux">{{cite web |url= http://www.ittuxtlagutierrez.edu.mx/contenido.php?id=2 |title=Historia |publisher= Instituto Tecnológico de Tuxtla Gutiérrez |location=Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Mexico |language=es |trans-title=History |access-date=May 29, 2011 }}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:En Tuxtla (10).jpg|thumb|left|Downtown Tuxtla Gutiérrez]]
The municipality is the only one in the state with a very low rate of economic marginalization. As of 2005, there were 121,312 residences, with 111,567 owned by their occupants. On average, there are 4.25 occupants per household, slightly lower than the regional and state averages of 4.52 and 4.85. Most homes have some kind of flooring, with less than ten percent having packed earth. Over 84% of homes have block sides. Over 70% have concrete slab roofs, with less than 15% having asbestos roofs. Over 98% have electricity, over 78% have running water, and about 94% have sewerage service.<ref name="encmuc"/>

Over 75% of the city's population is employed in commerce and services, which includes government. This is above the regional level of 53.36% and state level of 37.31%. Government at the state, federal and local levels has been one of the main sources of employment in the city since the 1970s.<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="burguete"/> Although the city has 68 hotels with 2,874 rooms, it is not a major tourist attraction. Most visitors to the city are there on business or Mexican nationals.<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="partone"/> However, it is a main transportation hub for those going to other parts of the state, with its first class bus station and [[Ángel Albino Corzo International Airport|new airport]]. Tourism during [[Holy Week]] adds over 150 million pesos to the state's economy, much of which passes through the city, with occupancy rates that rise fifty percent. Most foreign visitors through the city are young, especially from European countries such as France, Spain, Italy, [[Switzerland]] and England, who pass through the bus station.<ref name="derrame">{{cite news |title= Chiapas a la alza |author= Ivett Rangel |newspaper=Mural |location=Guadalajara, Mexico |date=April 18, 2004 |page=3 |language=es |trans-title=Chiapas on the rise}}</ref> However, most of them do not explore the city itself, because tour guides often state there is nothing here to see.<ref name="partone"/>

Just over 19% of the population is dedicated to industry, manufacturing, construction and transportation.<ref name="encmuc"/> Just over two percent of the municipality's population is dedicated to agriculture, livestock and forestry compared to 26.14 of the region and 47.25% of the state.<ref name="burguete"/> Economic activities include commerce and the agricultural production of corn, beans, fruit, dairy cattle and domestic fowl.<ref name="chiapasgob"/>

The most affluent parts of the city are usually located to the west, along with shopping centers and suburban neighborhoods. Downtown is mostly a business location, while the poorest areas are spread throughout the north and east.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cuarto-poder.com.mx/%5CPagPrincipal_Noticia.aspx?idNoticia=230381&idNoticiaSeccion=4&idNoticiaSubseccion=15|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130222125443/http://www.cuarto-poder.com.mx/%5CPagPrincipal_Noticia.aspx?idNoticia=230381&idNoticiaSeccion=4&idNoticiaSubseccion=15|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-02-22|title=''Atienden pobreza extrema en Tuxtla'' (Spanish)}}</ref>

==Transportation==

The city is a transportation hub for the whole short infrastructured state of Chiapas. Tuxtla is connected by road, bus and air to the rest of the country and Central America; there is no railroad access.

===Roads===
[[File:Panorámica de Tuxtla Gutiérrez desde el aire (recortado).jpg|thumb|Area of junction between Libramiento Norte and Calzada al Sumidero]]
The municipality has 54.25&nbsp;km of highways, over half are rural roads (28.75&nbsp;km). The [[Panamerican Highway]] is the main access way, crossing the city as [[Mexican Federal Highway 190|Federal Highway 190]] from west to east; the stretch from Ocozocoautla to Chiapa de Corzo has been upgraded to a 4-lane highway. A new bypass to the south of the city (Nuevo Libramiento Sur) was completed in 2018 to alleviate the heavy traffic.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.chiapasencontacto.com/listo-el-nuevo-libramiento-sur-de-tuxtla-gutierrez/| title = Tuxtla Gutierrez New Libramiento Sur is Ready |language=es-MX | website= Chiapas en Contacto|access-date = November 17, 2023}}</ref>

A-road, two-lane toll motorways connect the Tuxtla area with San Cristóbal (45 minutes), Arriaga (1 hour) and Minatitlán (2.5 hours). Other paved state highways link the city with Suchiapa/Villaflores (Hwy 133), the airport/La Angostura (Hwy 157) to the south, and San Fernando/Chicoasén (Hwy 102) to the north.

===Buses===
A new First Class bus station was opened in the northwest of the city, serving many Mexican travelers as well as backpackers especially from Europe. The bus station is served by the Cristobal Colon, Maya de Oro, ADO and Rapidos del Sur lines.
