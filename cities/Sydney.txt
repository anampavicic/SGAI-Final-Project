The [[Cadigal|Gadigal]] (Cadigal) clan, whose territory stretches along the southern shore of [[Port Jackson]] from [[Sydney Heads|South Head]] to [[Darling Harbour]], are the traditional owners of the land on which the British settlement was initially established, and call their territory ''Gadi'' (''Cadi''). Aboriginal clan names within the Sydney region were often formed by adding the suffix "-gal" to a word denoting the name for their territory, a specific place in their territory, a food source, or totem.

The inhabitants subsisted on fishing, hunting, and gathering plants and shellfish. The diet of the coastal clans was more reliant on seafood whereas hinterland clans ate more forest animals and plants. The clans had distinctive equipment and weapons mostly made of stone, wood, plant materials, bone and shell. They also differed in their body decorations, hairstyles, songs and dances. Aboriginal clans had a rich ceremonial life, part of a belief system centring on ancestral, totemic and supernatural beings.

=== Convict town (1788–1840) ===

Painting by [[Algernon Talmage]].]] [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] had been sending convicts to its American colonies for most of the eighteenth century, and the loss of these colonies in 1783 was the impetus to establish a penal colony at Botany Bay. Proponents of colonisation also pointed to the strategic importance of a new base in the Asia-Pacific region and its potential to provide much-needed timber and flax for the navy.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Macintyre |first=Stuart |title=A concise history of Australia |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2020 |isbn=9781108728485 |edition=5th |location=Port Melbourne |pages=34–35}}</ref>

The [[First Fleet]] of 11 ships under the command of Captain [[Arthur Phillip]] arrived in Botany Bay in January 1788. It comprised more than a thousand settlers, including 736 convicts.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Karskens |first=Grace |title=The Cambridge History of Australia, Volume 1, Indigenous and Colonial Australia |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2013 |isbn=9781107011533 |editor-last=Bashford |editor-first=Alison |location=Cambridge |pages=91 |chapter=The early colonial presence, 1788-1822 |editor-last2=MacIntyre |editor-first2=Stuart}}</ref> The fleet soon moved to the more suitable [[Port Jackson]] where a settlement was established at [[Sydney Cove]] on 26 January 1788.<ref>Peter Hill (2008) pp.141–50</ref> The colony of New South Wales was formally proclaimed by Governor Phillip on 7 February 1788.

The settlement was planned to be a self-sufficient penal colony based on subsistence agriculture. Trade and shipbuilding were banned in order to keep the convicts isolated. However, the soil around the settlement proved poor and the first crops failed, leading to several years of hunger and strict rationing. The food crisis was relieved with the arrival of the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] in mid-1790 and the [[Third Fleet (Australia)|Third Fleet]] in 1791.<ref>Macintyre (2020). pp.34–37</ref> Former convicts received small grants of land, and government and private farms spread to the more fertile lands around [[Parramatta]], [[Windsor, New South Wales|Windsor]] and [[Camden, New South Wales|Camden]] on the [[Cumberland Plain]].

Phillip had been given no instructions for urban development, but in July 1788 submitted a plan for the new town at [[Sydney Cove]]. It included a wide central avenue, a permanent Government House, law courts, hospital and other public buildings, but no provision for warehouses, shops, or other commercial buildings. Phillip promptly ignored his own plan, and unplanned development became a feature of Sydney's topography.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Karskens |first=Grace |title=The Colony, a history of early Sydney |publisher=Allen and Unwin |year=2009 |isbn=9781741756371 |location=Crows Nest, NSW |pages=71–75}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=McGillick |first1=Paul |title=Sydney architecture |last2=Bingham-Hall |first2=Patrick |year=2005 |page=14 to 15}}</ref>[[File:View of Sydney Cove - Thomas Watling.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Watling]]'s ''View of Sydney Cove'', {{Circa|1794}}–1796]]After Phillip's departure in December 1792, the colony's military officers began acquiring land and importing consumer goods from visiting ships. Former convicts engaged in trade and opened small businesses. Soldiers and former convicts built houses on Crown land, with or without official permission, in what was now commonly called Sydney town. Governor [[William Bligh]] (1806{{En dash}}08) imposed restrictions on commerce and ordered the demolition of buildings erected on Crown land, including some owned by past and serving military officers. The resulting conflict culminated in the [[Rum Rebellion]] of 1808, in which Bligh was deposed by the [[New South Wales Corps]].<ref>Karskens (2009). pp. 185–188</ref><ref>{{cite Q |Q5273962 |chapter=Bligh, William (1754–1817) |mode=cs1}}</ref>

Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] (1810{{En dash}}1821) played a leading role in the development of Sydney and New South Wales, establishing a bank, a currency and a hospital. He employed a planner to design the street layout of Sydney and commissioned the construction of roads, wharves, churches, and public buildings. [[Parramatta Road]], linking Sydney and Parramatta, was opened in 1811,<ref name="broomham3">{{Citation |author1=Broomham, Rosemary |title=Vital connections: a history of NSW roads from 1788 |date=2001 |page=25 |publisher=Hale & Iremonger in association with the [[Roads & Traffic Authority]] |isbn=978-0-86806-703-2}}</ref> and a road across the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] was completed in 1815, opening the way for large-scale farming and grazing west of the [[Great Dividing Range]].<ref name="Kingston-2006">{{Cite book |last=Kingston |first=Beverley |title=A History of New South Wales |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |isbn=9780521833844 |location=Cambridge |pages=118–19}}</ref><ref>Karskens, Grace (2013). pp. 115–17</ref>

Following the departure of Macquarie, official policy encouraged the emigration of free British settlers to New South Wales. Immigration to the colony increased from 900 free settlers in 1826–30 to 29,000 in 1836–40, many of whom settled in Sydney.<ref>Haines, Robin, and Ralph Shlomowitz.

As the colony spread to the more fertile lands around the [[Hawkesbury River]], north-west of Sydney, conflict between the settlers and the [[Darug]] people intensified, reaching a peak from 1794 to 1810. Bands of Darug people, led by [[Pemulwuy]] and later by his son [[Tedbury]], burned crops, killed livestock and raided settler stores in a pattern of resistance that was to be repeated as the [[Australian frontier wars|colonial frontier expanded]]. A military garrison was established on the Hawkesbury in 1795. The death toll from 1794 to 1800 was 26 settlers and up to 200 Darug.<ref>Flood, Josephine (2019). p. 66</ref><ref>Broome, Richard (2019). pp. 25–26</ref>

Conflict again erupted from 1814 to 1816 with the expansion of the colony into Dharawal country in the Nepean region south-west of Sydney. Following the deaths of several settlers, Governor Macquarie dispatched three military detachments into Dharawal lands, culminating in the [[Appin Massacre|Appin massacre]] (April 1816) in which at least 14 Aboriginal people were killed.<ref>Flood, Josephine (2019). p. 70</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Banivanua Mar |first1=Tracey |title=The Cambridge History of Australia, Volume I |last2=Edmonds |first2=Penelope |year=2013 |pages=344 |chapter=Indigenous and settler relations}}</ref>

=== Colonial city (1841–1900) ===
The New South Wales Legislative Council became a semi-elected body in 1842. Sydney was declared a city the same year, and a governing council established, elected on a restrictive property franchise.<ref name="Sydney-2020b"/>[[File:Sydney 1888.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial illustration of Sydney, 1888]]The discovery of gold in New South Wales and Victoria in 1851 initially caused economic disruption as men moved to the goldfields.

Drought, the winding down of public works and a financial crisis led to economic depression in Sydney throughout most of the 1890s. Meanwhile, the Sydney-based premier of New South Wales, [[George Reid]], became a key figure in the process of federation.<ref>KIngston (2006). pp. 88–89, 95–97</ref>

When the six colonies federated on 1 January 1901, Sydney became the capital of the State of New South Wales. The spread of [[bubonic plague]] in 1900 prompted the state government to modernise the wharves and demolish inner-city slums. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 saw more Sydney males volunteer for the armed forces than the Commonwealth authorities could process, and helped reduce unemployment. Those returning from the war in 1918 were promised "homes fit for heroes" in new suburbs such as Daceyville and Matraville. "Garden suburbs" and mixed industrial and residential developments also grew along the rail and tram corridors.<ref name="Fitzgerald-2011"/> The population reached one million in 1926, after Sydney had regained its position as the most populous city in Australia.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |date=2019 |title=Australian Historical Population Statistics, 3105.0.65.001, Population distribution |url=https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/historical-population/latest-release |access-date=2 August 2022 |website=Australian Bureau of Statistics |archive-date=1 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220801140830/https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/historical-population/latest-release |url-status=live }}</ref> The government created jobs with massive public projects such as the electrification of the [[Railways in Sydney|Sydney rail network]] and building the Sydney Harbour Bridge.<ref>Kingston (2006). p. 132</ref>

In January 1938, Sydney celebrated the [[Commonwealth Games|Empire Games]] and the sesquicentenary of European settlement in Australia. One journalist wrote, "Golden beaches. Sun tanned men and maidens...Red-roofed villas terraced above the blue waters of the harbour...Even [[Melbourne]] seems like some grey and stately city of Northern Europe compared with Sydney's sub-tropical splendours." A congress of the "Aborigines of Australia" declared 26 January "A [[Day of Mourning (Australia)|Day of Mourning]]" for "the whiteman's seizure of our country."<ref>Spearritt (2000). p. 72</ref>

With the outbreak of [[Second World War]] in 1939, Sydney experienced a surge in industrial development.

A post-war immigration and baby boom saw a rapid increase in Sydney's population and the spread of low-density housing in suburbs throughout the Cumberland Plain. Immigrants{{Em dash}}mostly from Britain and continental Europe{{Em dash}}and their children accounted for over three-quarters of Sydney's population growth between 1947 and 1971.<ref>Spearritt (2000). p. 91</ref> The newly created Cumberland County Council oversaw low-density residential developments, the largest at [[Green Valley, New South Wales|Green Valley]] and [[Mount Druitt]].

An estimated one million onlookers, most of the city's population, watched [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] land in 1954 at Farm Cove where Captain Phillip had raised the Union Jack 165 years earlier, commencing her [[Royal visits to Australia|Australian Royal Tour]].

Increasing high-rise development in Sydney and the expansion of suburbs beyond the "green belt" envisaged by the planners of the 1950s resulted in community protests. In the early 1970s, trade unions and resident action groups imposed [[green ban]]s on development projects in historic areas such as The Rocks. Federal, State and local governments introduced heritage and environmental legislation.<ref name="Fitzgerald-2011" /> The Sydney Opera House was also controversial for its cost and disputes between architect [[Jørn Utzon]] and government officials. However, soon after it opened in 1973 it became a major tourist attraction and symbol of the city.<ref>Kingston (2006). pp. 184–86</ref> The progressive reduction in tariff protection from 1974 began the transformation of Sydney from a manufacturing centre to a "world city".<ref>Spearritt (2000). pp. 109–12, 259–62</ref> From the 1980s, [[Immigration to Australia|overseas immigration]] grew rapidly, with [[Asia]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]] becoming major sources.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Sydney}}

===Topography===
[[File:Sydney, Australia by Sentinel-2.jpg|thumb|Sydney lies on a [[submergent coastline]] where the ocean level has risen to flood deep [[ria]]s.]]
Sydney is a coastal basin with the [[Tasman Sea]] to the east, the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] to the west, the Hawkesbury River to the north, and the [[Woronora Plateau]] to the south.

Sydney spans two geographic regions. The [[Cumberland Plain]] lies to the south and west of the Harbour and is relatively flat. The [[Hornsby Plateau]] is located to the north and is dissected by steep valleys. The flat areas of the south were the first to be developed; it was not until the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge that the northern reaches became more heavily populated. [[Beaches in Sydney|Seventy surf beaches]] can be found along its coastline, with Bondi Beach being the most famous.

The [[Nepean River]] wraps around the western edge of the city and becomes the Hawkesbury River before reaching [[Broken Bay]]. Most of Sydney's water storages can be found on tributaries of the Nepean River. The [[Parramatta River]] is mostly industrial and drains a large area of Sydney's western suburbs into Port Jackson. The southern parts of the city are drained by the [[Georges River]] and the [[Cooks River]] into Botany Bay.

There is no single definition of the boundaries of Sydney. The Australian Statistical Geography Standard definition of Greater Sydney covers {{cvt|12369|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} and includes the local government areas of [[Central Coast Council (New South Wales)|Central Coast]] in the north, [[City of Hawkesbury|Hawkesbury]] in the north-west, [[City of Blue Mountains|Blue Mountains]] in the west, [[Sutherland Shire]] in the south, and [[Wollondilly Shire|Wollondilly]] in the south-west.<ref name="AU Stats-2022">{{Cite web |date=5 October 2022 |title=Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Edition 3 |url=https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/standards/australian-statistical-geography-standard-asgs-edition-3/jul2021-jun2026 |access-date=29 January 2022 |website=Australian Bureau of Statistics |archive-date=27 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220127054537/https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/standards/australian-statistical-geography-standard-asgs-edition-3/jul2021-jun2026 |url-status=live }}</ref> The local government area of the [[City of Sydney]] covers about 26 square kilometres from [[Garden Island (New South Wales)|Garden island]] in the east to Bicentennial Park in the west, and south to the suburbs of Alexandria and [[Rosebery, New South Wales|Rosebery]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=4 August 2020 |title=Areas of Service |url=https://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/areas-of-service |access-date=29 December 2022 |website=City of Sydney |archive-date=29 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221229102646/https://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/areas-of-service |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Geology===
[[File:South Head, Sydney Harbour.jpg|alt=|thumb|Almost all of the exposed rocks around Sydney are [[Sydney sandstone]].]]

The [[Sydney Basin]] bioregion includes coastal features of cliffs, beaches, and estuaries. Deep river valleys known as [[ria]]s were carved during the Triassic period in the [[Hawkesbury sandstone]] of the coastal region.

Several localities, distinct from suburbs, exist throughout Sydney's inner reaches.

The Eastern Suburbs encompass the [[Municipality of Woollahra]], the [[City of Randwick]], the [[Waverley Municipal Council]], and parts of the [[Bayside Council]]. They include some of the most affluent and advantaged areas in the country, with some streets being amongst the most expensive in the world.

===Southern Sydney===
[[File:Sydney aerial view - Kurnell, La Perouse, Cronulla and Botany Bay.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Kurnell, New South Wales|Kurnell]], [[La Perouse, New South Wales|La Perouse]], and [[Cronulla, New South Wales|Cronulla]], along with various other suburbs, face Botany Bay.]]
The Southern district of Sydney includes the suburbs in the [[Local government in Australia|local government area]]s of the [[Georges River Council]] (collectively known as [[St George, New South Wales|St George]]) and the [[Sutherland Shire]] (colloquially known as 'The Shire'), on the southern banks of the [[Georges River]].

The [[Cronulla dunes|Kurnell peninsula]], near Botany Bay, is the site of the first landfall on the eastern coastline made by James Cook in 1770. [[La Perouse, New South Wales|La Perouse]], a historic suburb named after the French navigator [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse]], is notable for its old military outpost at [[Bare Island (New South Wales)|Bare Island]] and the [[Botany Bay National Park]].

The suburb of [[Cronulla, New South Wales|Cronulla]] in [[southern Sydney]] is close to Royal National Park, Australia's oldest national park. Hurstville, a large suburb with commercial and high-rise residential buildings dominating the skyline, has become a CBD for the southern suburbs.<ref>''The Book of Sydney Suburbs'', Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia {{ISBN|0-207-14495-8}}, page 149</ref>

===Northern Sydney===
{{further|Northern Sydney}}
[[File:Aerial View Chatswood to Sydney CBD.jpg|thumb|[[Chatswood, New South Wales|Chatswood]] is a major commercial district.]]
'[[Northern Sydney]]' may also include the suburbs in the [[Upper North Shore]], [[Lower North Shore (Sydney)|Lower North Shore]] and the [[Northern Beaches]].

The Northern Suburbs include several landmarks – [[Macquarie University]], [[Gladesville Bridge]], [[Ryde Bridge]], [[Macquarie Centre]] and Curzon Hall in [[Marsfield, New South Wales|Marsfield]]. This area includes suburbs in the [[Local government in Australia|local government areas]] of [[Hornsby Shire]], [[Ku-ring-gai Council]], [[City of Ryde]], the [[Municipality of Hunter's Hill]] and parts of the [[City of Parramatta]].

The North Shore includes the commercial centres of [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]] and Chatswood. North Sydney itself consists of a large commercial centre, which contains the second largest concentration of high-rise buildings in Sydney after the CBD. North Sydney is dominated by advertising, marketing and associated trades, with many large corporations holding offices.

The Northern Beaches area includes [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]], one of Sydney's most popular holiday destinations for much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The region also features [[Sydney Heads]], a series of [[headlands]] which form the entrance to Sydney Harbour. The Northern Beaches area extends south to the entrance of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), west to [[Middle Harbour]] and north to the entrance of [[Broken Bay]]. The 2011 Australian census found the Northern Beaches to be the most [[White people|white]] and [[mono-ethnic]] district in Australia, contrasting with its more-diverse neighbours, the North Shore and the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rodis.com.au/wiki/Northern-Beaches-Sydney.php|title=National Regional Profile Northern Beaches Sydney|website=Rodis.com.au|access-date=2 July 2022|archive-date=2 March 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220302151024/https://rodis.com.au/wiki/Northern-Beaches-Sydney.php|url-status=live}}</ref>

As of the end of 2021, half of the 20 most expensive postcodes in Australia (by median house price) were in Northern Sydney, including four on the Northern Beaches, two on the Lower North Shore, three on the Upper North Shore, and one straddling [[Hunters Hill]] and [[Woolwich, New South Wales|Woolwich]].<ref name="top20"/>

===Hills district===
The [[Hills District, New South Wales|Hills district]] generally refers to the suburbs in north-western Sydney including the local government areas of [[The Hills Shire]], parts of the [[City of Parramatta Council]] and [[Hornsby Shire]]. Actual suburbs and localities that are considered to be in the Hills District can be somewhat amorphous. For example, the Hills District Historical Society restricts its definition to the Hills Shire local government area, yet its study area extends from Parramatta to the Hawkesbury. The region is so named for its characteristically comparatively hilly topography as the Cumberland Plain lifts up, joining the Hornsby Plateau. [[Windsor Road|Windsor]] and [[Old Windsor Road]]s are the second and third roads, respectively, laid in Australia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ozroads.com.au/NSW/RouteNumbering/State%20Routes/40/oldwindsor%26windsorroad.htm|title=Ozroads: Old Windsor Road & Windsor Road|website=Ozroads.com.au|access-date=2 July 2022|archive-date=26 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426001422/https://www.ozroads.com.au/NSW/RouteNumbering/State%20Routes/40/oldwindsor%26windsorroad.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 26 May 2019, The [[Sydney Metro Northwest]], which went from Chatswood to Tallawong, opened, with a large portion running through the Hills District, which meant the Hills District, for the first time, started having heavy rail.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2019-01-14|title=Major Milestone As Metro Northwest Completes Its First Full Test|url=https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/node/9580|access-date=2021-02-09|website=Transport for NSW|language=en-AU}}</ref>
