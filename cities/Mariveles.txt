[[File:Mariveles historical marker (cropped).JPG|thumb|left|upright|National historical marker installed in 1950 and located at the muicipal hall]]

Founded as a ''pueblo'' by a [[Franciscan]] Friar in 1578, Mariveles, the "Village of Camaya" was part of the Corregimiento of Mariveles, including [[Bagac, Bataan|Bagac]] and [[Morong, Bataan|Morong]], [[Corregidor]] and [[Maragondon, Cavite]].  The name Mariveles comes from "Maria Velez", a Mexican nun who eloped with a monk back in the 1600s. With its natural cove, the port was used by ships from China and Spain to resupply.<ref name="bataangov">{{cite web |title=Mariveles |url=https://www.bataan.gov.ph/mariveles/ |website=bataan.gov.ph |publisher=Provincial Government of Bataan |access-date=30 August 2022}}</ref>

The Superior Decree of July 1754 declared Mariveles' independence from [[Pampanga]].

In the 19th century, the Americans established the first quarantine station in the old Spanish [[Leprosarium]] Hospital (now known as the [[Mariveles Mental Wellness and General Hospital]]).

Mariveles Bay was the site of [[Mariveles Naval Section Base]], completed for the [[United States Asiatic Fleet]] on 22 July 1941, and was  [[Battle of Bataan#Fall of Bataan|surrendered]] to the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] on 9 April 1942.
