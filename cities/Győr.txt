It is the sixth largest city in Hungary, and one of its seven main regional centres. The city has [[City with county rights|county rights]].

==History==
The area along the [[Danube]] River has been inhabited by varying cultures since ancient times. The first large settlement dates back to the 5th century BCE; the inhabitants were [[Celts]]. They called the town ''Ara Bona'' "Good altar", later contracted to ''Arrabona'', a name which was used until the eighth century. Its shortened form is still used as the German (''Raab'') and Slovak (''Ráb'') names of the city.

Roman merchants moved to Arrabona during the 1st century BCE. Around 10 CE, the Roman army occupied the northern part of Western Hungary, which they called ''[[Pannonia]]''. Although the Roman Empire abandoned the area in the 4th century due to constant attacks by the tribes living to the east, the town remained inhabited.

Around 500 the territory was settled by [[Slavs]], in 547 by the [[Lombards]], and in 568–c. 800 by the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], at that time under [[Franks|Frankish]] and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] influence. During this time it was called ''Rabba'' and later ''Raab''. Between 880 and 894, it was part of [[Great Moravia]], and then briefly under [[East Frankish]] dominance.
[[File:Karmelita_templom_Győrben.jpg|thumb|right|[[Carmelites|Carmelite]] church in Győr]]
[[File:Györ Ufer der Raab 3.JPG|thumb|[[Rába]] at Győr]]The [[Magyars]] occupied the town around 900 and fortified the abandoned Roman fortress. [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I]], the first king of Hungary, founded an [[episcopate]] there. The town received its Hungarian name ''Győr'', which likely derives from Old Hungarian personal name Győr, who could be the county's first [[Ispán|count]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Bényei |first1=Ágnes |url=https://vmek.oszk.hu/01600/01695/01695.pdf |title=Az Árpád-kori Győr vármegye településneveinek nyelvészeti elemzése |last2=Pethő |first2=Gergely |publisher=Magyar Névarchívum |year=1998 |isbn=9634722857 |editor-last=Hofmann |editor-first=István |location=[[Debrecen]] |page=16 |trans-title=The linguistic analysis of Győr county's place names from the age of the House of Árpád}}</ref> The town was affected by all the trials and tribulations of the history of Hungary: it was occupied by Mongols during the [[First Mongol invasion of Hungary|Mongol invasion (1241–1242)]] and then was destroyed by the [[Czech lands|Czech]] army in 1271.

After the disastrous [[battle of Mohács]], Baron [[Tamás Nádasdy]] and Count [[György Cseszneky]] occupied the town for King [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] while [[János Szapolyai|John Zápolya]] also was attempting to annex it. During the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman occupation]] of present-day central and eastern Hungary<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/511433/Royal-Hungary |title=Royal Hungary (historical region, Hungary) - |encyclopedia=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |access-date=2011-09-16}}</ref> (1541 - late 17th century), Győr's commander Kristóf Lamberg thought it would be futile to try to defend the town from the Turkish army. He burned down the town and the Turkish forces found nothing but blackened ruins, hence the Turkish name for Győr, ''Yanık kale'' ("burnt castle").

During rebuilding, the town was surrounded with a castle and a city wall designed by the leading Italian builders of the era. The town changed in character during these years, with many new buildings built in [[Renaissance]] style, but the main square and the grid of streets remained.

In 1594, after the death of Count [[János Cseszneky]], captain of Hungarian footsoldiers, the Ottoman army occupied the castle and the town. In 1598 the Hungarian and Austrian army took control of it again and occupied it.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Sugar|editor1-first=Peter F.|editor2-last=Hanák|editor2-first=Péter|editor3-last=Frank|editor3-first=Tibor|title=A History of Hungary|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofhungary00suga|url-access=registration|date=1990|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofhungary00suga/page/97 97]}}</ref> During the Turkish occupation the city was called Yanık Kala (burned place, as a reference to the enormous damages caused by the siege).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arcanum.hu/hu/online-kiadvanyok/Borovszky-borovszky-samu-magyarorszag-varmegyei-es-varosai-1/gyor-varmegye-A041/gyor-varmegye-es-varos-tortenete-irta-reiszig-ede-dr-a-szerkeszto-bizottsag-tagja-a-ref-egyhazra-vonatkozo-reszt-szabo-zsigmond-ref-lelkesz-az-a-A8CD/ii-resz-a-mohacsi-vesztol-a-kiegyezesig-AAE2/2-torok-uralom-gyor-varmegyeben-es-gyorott-ABC4/gyor-ostroma-ABD4/|title=Győr ostroma. {{!}} Borovszky Samu: Magyarország vármegyéi és városai {{!}} Kézikönyvtár|website=www.arcanum.hu|language=hu|access-date=2018-09-26}}</ref>

In 1683, the Turks returned briefly, only to leave after being defeated in the [[Battle of Vienna]].

During the following centuries, the town became prosperous. In 1743 Győr was elevated to [[free royal town]] status by [[Maria Theresa]]. The religious orders of [[Jesuits]] and [[Carmelites]] settled there, building schools, churches, a hospital, and a monastery.

On 14 June 1809, during the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]], this was the site of the Battle of Győr ([[Battle of Raab]]), where the army of [[Eugène de Beauharnais]] defeated the Hungarian "noble insurrection" (militia) and an Austrian corps under the Archdukes [[Archduke Joseph, Palatine of Hungary|Joseph]] and [[Archduke John of Austria|Johann]]. Napoleon's forces occupied the castle and had some of its walls blown up. The leaders of the town soon realized that the old ramparts were not useful any more. Most of the ramparts were destroyed, allowing the town to expand.

In the mid-19th century, Győr's role in trade grew as [[steamship]] traffic on the River Danube began. The town lost its importance in trade when the railway line between Budapest and [[Nagykanizsa|Kanizsa]] superseded river traffic after 1861. The town leaders compensated for this loss with industrialisation. The town prospered until World War II when several buildings were destroyed. Some large-scale [[strategic bombing]] devastated industrial and residential areas as well as the airport. It was targeted because the [[Rába (company)|Rába]] factory was a main tank ([[40M Turán|Turán]]) and aeroplane ([[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109]]) producer. One of these raids destroyed some parts of the maternity hospital.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://regigyor.hu/vegyes/az-1944-aprilis-13-gyori-terrorbombazas/|title=Az 1944. április 13-i győri terrorbombázás - Régi Győr|last=Endre|first=Kozma|website=regigyor.hu|language=hu|access-date=2018-09-26}}</ref>

The 1950s and '60s brought more change: only big blocks of flats were built, and the old historical buildings were not given care or attention. In the 1970s the reconstruction of the city centre began; old buildings were restored and reconstructed. In 1989 Győr won the European award for the protection of monuments.{{Citation needed|reason=precise name and awarding body needed|date=April 2009}}

A 100-year-old Raba factory on the River Danube close to the historical centre is to be replaced by a new community called Városrét. The mixed-use community will have residential and commercial space as well as schools, clinics and parks.

The city's main theatre is the [[National Theatre of Győr]], finished in 1978. It features large ceramic ornaments made by [[Victor Vasarely]].

The city has several historical buildings, for example the castle, and the Lutheran Evangelic church.

== Main sights ==
The ancient core of the city is Káptalan Hill at the confluence of three rivers: the [[Danube|Mosoni-Danube]], [[Rába]], and [[Rábca]]. Püspökvár, the residence of Győr's bishops, can be easily recognized by its incomplete tower. Győr's oldest buildings are the 13th-century dwelling tower and the 15th-century Gothic Dóczy Chapel. The cathedral, originally in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]], was rebuilt in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Baroque]] style.

Other sights include:
*Town Hall
*Benedictine church of St. Ignatius of Loyola
*Carmelite church
*Museum of Roman Archaeology

The [[Pannonhalma Archabbey]] is located some {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=in}} outside the town.
