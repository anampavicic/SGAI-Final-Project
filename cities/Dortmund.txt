Founded around 882,<ref name="WM-document-882">[[:File:Boevinghausen erwaehnung.jpg|Wikimedia Commons]]: First documentary reference to Dortmund-Bövinghausen from 882, contribution-list of the Werden Abbey (near Essen), North-Rhine-Westphalia, Germany</ref> Dortmund became an [[Imperial Free City]]. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the "chief city" of the Rhine, Westphalia, and the Netherlands Circle of the [[Hanseatic League]]. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], the city was destroyed and decreased in significance until the onset of industrialization. The city then became one of Germany's most important coal, steel, and beer centres; as a consequence, it was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during [[World War II]]. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 destroyed 98% of buildings in the inner city centre. The raids, with more than 1,110 aircraft, were the largest for a single target in World War II.<ref name="backtonormandy.org">{{cite web|url=https://www.backtonormandy.org/the-history/air-force-operations/airplanes-in-actions/lancaster/raf-bomber-command-748-lancasters-record-attack-dortmund-12-march-1945.html|title=Support – Main Menu|website=Backtonormandy.org|access-date=16 February 2017|archive-date=13 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813042135/https://www.backtonormandy.org/the-history/air-force-operations/airplanes-in-actions/lancaster/raf-bomber-command-748-lancasters-record-attack-dortmund-12-march-1945.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> Today around 30 % of the city consists of buildings from before World War II.<ref name="Zensus 2011">{{cite web |title=Zensus 2011 - Gebäude- und Wohnungsbestand in Deutschland |url=https://zensus2011.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/Aufsaetze_Archiv/2015_12_NI_GWZ_endgueltig.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4#page=90r |publisher=Statistische Ämter Des Bundes Und Der Länder}}</ref>

Dortmund is home to many [[Culture of Germany|cultural]] and [[Education in Germany|educational]] institutions. It is the location of the [[Technical University of Dortmund]], [[Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts]], the [[International School of Management, Germany|International School of Management]], and other educational, cultural and administrative facilities, with over 49,000 students.

===Etymology===
[[File:SiegelDortmund1358GedenktafelAlterMarkt.png|thumb|left|upright=0.9|"Seal of Dortmund, the city of Westphalia" [SIGILLVM TREMONIE CIVITATIS WESTFALIE]]]
Dortmund was first mentioned in the [[Werden Abbey]], which was built between 880 and 884. The Latin entry reads: ''In Throtmanni liber homo Arnold viii den nob solvit'' (German: ''In Throtmanni zahlt uns der freie Mann Arnold 8 Pfennige'', and English: ''In Throtmanni the free man Arnold pays us 8 pfennigs'').<ref name="Reimann1">Norbert Reimann: I. Das Werden der Stadt. Die Anfänge. Der Königshof Karls des Großen. In: Stadtarchiv Dortmund (Hrsg.): Geschichte der Stadt Dortmund. Harenberg, Dortmund 1994, {{ISBN|3-611-00397-2}}, S. 24–25 (Reihe Dortmunder Leistungen, Band 2)</ref>
According to this, there are a large number of different names, but they all go back to the same phoneme stem. Their respective use in the sources appears arbitrary and random.

In the course of time the name changed many times: ''trut munia'' 899, ''Thortmanni, Trutmania, Trotmunni'' 939, ''Tremonia'' 1152. From the 13th century on, the ''Dortmunde'' appeared for the first time, but it was not until a few centuries later that it became generally accepted.

In the [[Middle Ages]] 1389, when the city had withstood the siege of 1,200 knights under the leadership of the Archbishop of [[Cologne]], it chose as its motto a saying that is still upheld today by traditional societies: ''So fast as Düörpm'' ([[High German languages|High German]]: "as firm as Dortmund").

In the past, the city was called "''Dortmond''" in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], "''Tremonia''" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and "''Trémoigne''" in [[Old French]]. However, these exonyms have fallen into disuse and the city is now internationally known by its German name of ''Dortmund''. The common [[abbreviation]] for the name of the city is "DTM", the [[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA code]] for [[Dortmund Airport]].

===Early history===
[[File:Dortmund Braun-Hogenberg.jpg|thumb|Historical view of Dortmund by Georg Braun and Franz Hogenberg (between 1572 and 1618)]]
The [[Sigiburg]] was a [[hillfort]] in the south of present-day Dortmund, overlooking the River [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] near its confluence with the River [[Lenne]]. The ruins of the later [[Syberg|Hohensyburg]] castle now stand on the site of the Sigiburg. The hillfort is presumably of [[Saxons|Saxon]] origin, but there is no archeological or documentary proof of this. During the [[Saxon Wars]], it was taken by the [[Franks]] under [[Charlemagne]] in 772, retaken by the Saxons (possibly under [[Widukind]]) in 774, and taken again and refortified by Charlemagne in 775. [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] evidence suggests the Sigiburg site was also occupied in the [[Neolithic]] era.<ref>Detlef Rothe ''Rekonstruktion der Sächsischen Wallburg Sigiburg'', citing [[Werner Rolevinck]] and the [[Royal Frankish Annals]] [http://www.5dim.de/Aufsaetze/RekonstruktionSigiburg/19751214RekonstruktionSigiburg.html]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz85382.html|title=Widukind – Deutsche Biographie|first=Deutsche|last=Biographie|website=Deutsche-biographie.de}}</ref>

The first time Dortmund was mentioned in official documents was around 882 as '''Throtmanni''' – In throtmanni liber homo arnold[us] viii den[arios] nob[is] soluit [solvit].<ref name="WM-document-882"/><ref>[[Rudolf Kötzschke]] (ed.): Die Urbare der Abtei Werden a. d.

After it was destroyed by a fire, the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick I (Barbarossa)]] had the town rebuilt in 1152 and resided there (among other places) for two years. In 1267 St. Mary's Church, Dortmund, and three years later in 1270 [[St. Reinold's Church, Dortmund|St. Reinold's Church]] first mentioned. The combination of crossroad, market place, administrative centre – town hall, made Dortmund an important centre in Westphalia. 
It became an [[Imperial Free City]] and one of the first cities in Europe with an official [[Brewing right]] in 1293.{{sfn|Ring|1995}} Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the "chief city" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the [[Hanseatic League]].
[[File:Alte Markt Dortmund.JPG|thumb|Old market [[St. Reinoldi (Dortmund)|St. Reinolds]]]]
After 1320, the city appeared in writing as "Dorpmunde". In the years leading up to 1344, the English King, [[Edward III]], even borrowed money from well-heeled Dortmund merchant families Berswordt and Klepping, offering the regal crown as security. In 1388, the [[County of Mark|Count of Mark]] joined forces with the Archbishop of [[Cologne]] and issued declarations of a feud against the town. Following a major siege lasting 18 months, peace negotiations took place and Dortmund emerged victorious. In 1400 the seat of the first Vehmic court ({{langx|de|Freistuhl}}) was in Dortmund, in a square between two [[linden tree]]s, one of which was known as the ''[[Gerichtslinde|Femelinde]]''. With the growing influence of [[Cologne]] during the 15th century, the seat was moved to [[Arnsberg]] in 1437. After Cologne was excluded after the [[Anglo-Hanseatic War]] (1470–74), Dortmund was made capital of the Rhine-Westphalian and Netherlands Circle. This favors the founding of one of the oldest schools in Europe in 1543 – {{Interlanguage link|Stadtgymnasium Dortmund|de}}.{{sfn|Ring|1995}} In [[List of earthquakes in Germany|1661 an earthquake]] made the [[Reinoldikirche]] collapse.

===18th, 19th and early 20th centuries===
[[File:Dortmund um 1804.jpg|thumb|left|Pre-industrial Dortmund in 1804]]
With the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' resolution in 1803, Dortmund was added to the [[Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda]], with as a result that it was no longer a [[free imperial city]]. [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V, Prince of Orange-Nassau]] did not want stolen areas and therefore let his son [[William I of the Netherlands|Prince Willem Frederik]] (the later King William I of the Netherlands) take possession of the city and the principality. This prince held its entry on 30 June 1806, and as such the [[County of Dortmund]] then became part of the principality. On 12 July 1806, most of the Nassau principalities were deprived of their sovereign rights by means of the [[Treaty of the Confederation of the Rhine|Rhine treaty]]. In October of the same year, the County of Dortmund was occupied by French troops and was added to the [[Grand Duchy of Berg]] on 1 March 1808. It is the capital of the Ruhr department. In 1808 Dortmund becomes capital of French satellite [[Ruhr (department)]].{{sfn|Britannica|1910}} At the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, the entire Grand Duchy of Berg, including Dortmund, was added to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. The state mining authority of the [[Ruhr area]] was founded in 1815 and moved from Bochum to Dortmund. Within the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[Province of Westphalia]], Dortmund was a district seat within [[Regierungsbezirk Arnsberg]] until 1875, when it became an urban district within the region.

[[File:French in Dortmund LCCN2014715868 (cropped).jpg|thumb|French troops in Dortmund {{circa|1923–1925}}]]
During the [[industrialisation]] of Prussia, Dortmund became a major centre for [[coal]] and [[steel]]. The town expanded into a city, with the population rising from 57,742 in 1875 to 379,950 in 1905. Sprawling residential areas like the North, East, Union and Kreuz district sprang up in less than 10 years. In 1920, Dortmund was one of the centres for resistance to the [[Kapp Putsch]] – a right-wing military coup launched against the [[Social Democratic]]-led government. In the [[Ruhr uprising]], radical workers formed the 50,000-man [[Ruhr Red Army]] in hopes of setting up a soviet-style government. They were defeated with considerable loss of life by government and [[Freikorps]] units.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wulfert |first=Anja |date=22 January 2002 |title=Der Märzaufstand 1920 |trans-title=The March Uprising 1920 |url=https://www.dhm.de/lemo/kapitel/weimarer-republik/innenpolitik/maerzaufstand-1920.html |access-date=1 August 2024 |website=Deutsches Historisches Museum |language=de}}</ref> On 11 January 1923, French and Belgian troops [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied the Ruhr]].

Under [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Old Synagogue (Dortmund)|Old Synagogue]], which had opened in 1900, was destroyed in 1938. With a capacity of 1,300 seats, it was one of the largest Jewish houses of worship in Germany. Also, the [[Aplerbeck Hospital]] in Dortmund transferred mentally and/or physically disabled patients to the [[Hadamar Killing Facility]] as part of ''[[Aktion T4]]'', where they were murdered. An additional 229 children were murdered in the "Children's Specialist Department", which was transferred from Marburg in 1941.

Dortmund was the location of the Stalag VI-D [[German prisoner-of-war camps in World War II|prisoner-of-war camp]] for Polish, [[French prisoners of war in World War II|French]], Belgian, British, Serbian, Soviet and Italian POWs with some 300 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]] units in the city alone,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Megargee|first1=Geoffrey P.|last2=Overmans|first2=Rüdiger|last3=Vogt|first3=Wolfgang|year=2022|title=The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos 1933–1945.

The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Dortmund in April 1945. The US [[95th Infantry Division (United States)|95th Infantry Division]] attacked the city on 12 April 1945 against a stubborn German defense. The division, assisted by close air support, advanced through the ruins in urban combat and completed its capture on 13 April 1945.<ref>Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939–1946'' (Revised Edition, 2006), Stackpole Books, p. 171.</ref>

Dortmund{{sfn|Hennings|1990}} has since adapted, with its century-long steel and coal industries having been replaced by high-technology areas, including [[biomedical technology]], [[micro systems technology]], and [[Service (economics)|services]]. This has led Dortmund to become a regional centre for hi-tech industry.

In 2001 a new era began for the district [[Hörde]] in Dortmund, 160 years of industrial history ended with the beginning of the Phoenix See. The development of the Phoenix See area was carried out by a subsidiary of the Stadtwerke AG. In 2005 the first cornerstone was laid on the Phoenix area. The work started with full speed to manage the work with over 2.5 million meters of ground motion and 420.000 cubic meters of ferroconcrete. On 1 October 2010, the largest and most highly anticipated milestone could be celebrated: the launch of the flooding of the Phoenix See. Since 9 May 2011, the fences disappeared and the Phoenix See has been completed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dortmund.de/en/leisure_and_culture/phoenix_see_1/index.html|title= Lake Phoenix|publisher=Stadt Dortmund|access-date=24 April 2017}}</ref> In 2009, Dortmund was classified as a ''Node city'' in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow<ref name="innovation-cities.com"/> and is the most sustainable city in [[Germany]].<ref name="www.nachhaltigkeitspreis.de"/>

On 3 November 2013, more than 20,000 people were evacuated after a [[Blockbuster bomb|4,000-pound bomb]] from [[World War II]] was found. German authorities safely defused the bomb.

==Geography==

===Location===
[[File:2012-10-06 Dortmund Sonnenuntergang über der Emscher.jpg|thumb|left|Emscher River in Dortmund]]
Dortmund is an independent city located in the east of the [[Ruhr]] area, one of the largest [[urban area]]s in Europe (see also: [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]]), comprising eleven [[independent city|independent cities]] and four [[district]]s with some 5.3{{nbsp}}million inhabitants. The city limits of Dortmund itself are {{convert|87|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long and border twelve cities, two independent and ten ''kreisangehörig'' (i.e., belonging to a district), with a total population of approximately 2.4{{nbsp}}million. The following cities border Dortmund (clockwise starting from west): [[Bochum]], [[Castrop-Rauxel]], [[Waltrop]], [[Lünen]], [[Kamen]], [[Unna]], [[Holzwickede]], [[Schwerte]], [[Hagen]], [[Herdecke]], and [[Witten]]. Historically speaking, Dortmund is a part of [[Westphalia]] which is situated in the Bundesland North Rhine-Westphalia. Moreover, Dortmund is part of [[Westphalian Lowland]] and adjoins with the [[Ardey Hills]], in the south of the city, to the [[Sauerland]].

The [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] forms the [[Reservoir (water)|reservoir]] on the [[Hengsteysee]] next to the borough of [[Syburg]] in the south of Dortmund between the cities of [[Hagen]] and [[Herdecke]], North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The [[Klusenberg]], a hill that is part of the [[Ardey Hills|Ardey]] range, is located just north of the Hengsteysee and the highest point of Dortmund {{cvt|254.3|m|||}}. There is also a [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage plant]] on this reservoir, named Koepchenwerk. The lowest point can be found in the northern borough of Brechten at {{cvt|48.9|m|||}}.

The [[Emscher]] is a small river and has its wellspring in [[Holzwickede]], east of the city of Dortmund, and flows west through Dortmund. Towns along the Emscher take in Dortmund, [[Castrop-Rauxel]], [[Herne, Germany|Herne]], [[Recklinghausen]], [[Gelsenkirchen]], [[Essen]], [[Bottrop]], [[Oberhausen]], and [[Dinslaken]], where it flows into the Rhine.

===Boroughs===
[[File:Dortmund Bezirke und Nachbargemeinden.png|thumb|right|Municipalities and neighbouring communities]]
[[File:Kreuzviertel_Althoffblock_alte_Hoeschzentrale_von_Florianturm.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of urban [[Kreuzviertel]]]]
Dortmund comprises 62 neighbourhoods which in turn are grouped into twelve boroughs (called "'''''Stadtbezirke'''''"), often named after the most important neighbourhood. Three boroughs cover the area of the inner city (Innenstadt-West (City centre West), Innenstadt-Nord (City centre North), Innenstadt-Ost (City centre East)) and the remaining nine boroughs make up the surrounding area ([[Eving]], [[Scharnhorst (Dortmund)|Scharnhorst]], [[Brackel (Dortmund)|Brackel]], [[Aplerbeck]], [[Hörde]], [[Hombruch]], [[Lütgendortmund]], [[Huckarde]], [[Mengede]]). Each "'''''Stadtbezirk'''''" is assigned a Roman numeral and has a local governing body of nineteen members with limited authority. Most of the boroughs were originally independent municipalities but were gradually annexed from 1905 to 1975. This long-lasting process of annexation has led to a strong identification of the population with "their" boroughs or districts and to a rare peculiarity: The borough of Hörde, located in the south of Dortmund and independent until 1928, has its own coat of arms.

The centre can be subdivided into historically evolved city districts, whose borders are not always strictly defined, such as:
*Stadtzentrum ''(City centre)''
*Hafenviertel ''(Harbour Quarter)''
*Nordmarkt ''(Northern market)''
*Borsigplatz
*Kaiserviertel ''(Emperor Quarter)''
*Kronenviertel ''(Crown Quarter)''
*Kreuzviertel ''(Cross Quarter)''
*Klinikviertel ''(Clinical Quarter)''
*Saarlandstraßenviertel ''(Saarland street Quarter)''
*Unionviertel ''(Union Quarter)''
*Gartenstadt ''(Garden Town)''

===Climate===
Dortmund is situated in the [[Temperateness|temperate climate zone]] with [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''). Winters are cool; summers are warm. The average annual temperature lies at approximately {{convert|9|to|10|°C|°F}}, the total average annual amount of precipitation lies at approximately {{convert|800|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Precipitation evenly falls throughout the year; steady rain (with some snow), prevails in the wintertime, isolated showers dominate the summer season. Dortmund features characteristics of densely populated areas as for example the occurrence of [[urban heat islands]] is typical.<ref>{{cite web|title=Geografie & Klima – Stadtporträt – Leben in Dortmund – Stadtportal dortmund.de|url=http://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/stadtportraet/geografie_und_klima/index.html|access-date=2020-03-19|date=2013-01-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115215001/http://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/stadtportraet/geografie_und_klima/index.html|archive-date=15 January 2013}}</ref>

==Demographics==
Dortmund's population grew rapidly in the time of the 19th century industrialisation, when coal mining and steel processing in the city began. 1904 marks the year when Dortmund saw a population of more than 100,000 for the first time in its history. During the 19th century the area around Dortmund, called [[Ruhr]], attracted up to 500,000 ethnic [[Polish people|Poles]], [[Masurians]], and [[Silesians]] from [[East Prussia]] and [[Silesia]], in a migration known as ''[[Ostflucht]]'' (flight from the east). Most of the new inhabitants came from Eastern Europe, but immigrants also came from France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Almost all their descendants today speak German as a mother tongue, and for various reasons, they do not identify with their Polish roots and traditions; often only their Polish family names remaining as a sign of their past. Not taking the fluctuation of war years into account, the population figures rose constantly to 657,804 in 1965. As a result of the city's post-industrial decline, the population fell to just under 580,000 in 2011. Today, with a population of 601.402 (2017), the City of Dortmund is [[List of cities in Germany by population|the eighth largest city in Germany]] after [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]], [[Munich]], [[Cologne]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Stuttgart]], and [[Düsseldorf]]. It is also the largest city in the [[Ruhr]] agglomeration.

Contrary to earlier projections, population figures have been on the rise in recent years due to net migration gains. Dortmund has seen a moderate influx of younger people (18 to 25 years of age) mainly because of its universities.<ref name="dortmund.de">{{cite web |url=http://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/nachrichtenportal/nachricht.jsp?nid=230976 |title=Dortmund 2012: Mehr Einwohner, mehr Studierende, mehr Übernachtungen – Nachrichtenportal – Leben in Dortmund – Stadtportal |publisher=Dortmund.de |date=31 December 2012 |access-date=2013-03-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211183302/http://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/nachrichtenportal/nachricht.jsp?nid=230976 |archive-date=11 February 2013 }}</ref> Data of the [[2011 EU census|EU-wide 2011 census]] revealed massive inaccuracies with regard to German population figures.

{{As of|2012}}, Dortmund had a population of 571,403, of whom about 177,000 (roughly 30%) were of non-German origin.<ref name="dortmund.de"/> The table shows the number of first and second generation immigrants in Dortmund by nationality as of 31 December 2014.<ref name="dev.statistik.dortmund.de">http://dev.statistik.dortmund.de/project/assets/template1.jsp?col=2&content=me&smi=10.2.4&tid=66334 {{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> As with much of the Ruhr area, Dortmund has sizable Turkish and South European communities (particularly Spanish), and had one of Germany's most visible Slavic populations.

===Religion===
{{As of|2022}}, the largest Christian denominations were Protestantism (23,7%) and [[Catholicism]] (22,6% of the population).<ref>{{cite web |title=Dortmund in Zahlen |url=https://statistikportal.dortmund.de/dortmundinzahlen/#Bev%C3%B6lkerung |website=Statistikportal Dortmund |publisher=Stadt Dortmund}}</ref> Furthermore, in Dortmund the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], and the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]] are represented. The Church of the Holy Apostles (gre. I.N. Αγίων Αποστόλων Ντόρτμουντ – I.N. Agíon Apostólon Dortmund) was the first Greek church in Germany to be founded due to the influx of "guest workers". Also Dortmund is home of the [[New Apostolic Church]] in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], with more than 84,944 community members.

The Jewish community has a history dating back to Medieval times and has always ranked among the largest in [[Westphalia]]. Dortmund is home to the National Association of Jewish Communities of Westfalen-Lippe. The synagogues operate there in City center, Hörde, and Dorstfeld. Due to the growing immigration of people from Muslim countries beginning in the 1960s, Dortmund has a large Muslim community with more than 30 mosques.

In June 2019 Dortmund hosted the 37th Evangelischer Kirchentag – [[German Evangelical Church Assembly]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirchentag.org.uk |title=Kirchentag 2019 |website=Stadtportal Dortmund}}</ref>

== Government and politics ==
[[File:Stadtwappen Dortmund.png|thumb|upright|Dortmund coat of arms]]
[[File:Dortmund Rathaus IMGP6046.jpg|thumb|Townhall Dortmund]]
[[File:AmtshausDortmundAplerbeck.jpg|thumb|Townhall Aplerbeck, one of twelve district councils]]
Dortmund is one of nineteen [[Independent city|independent district-free cities]] (''[[Urban districts of Germany|kreisfreie Städte]]'') in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], which means that it does not form part of another general-purpose local government entity, in this case it is not part of a [[List of rural districts of Germany|Landkreis]]. Since 1975, Dortmund is divided into twelve administrative districts. Each district (''Bezirk'') has its own elected district council (Bezirksvertretung) and its own district mayor (Bezirksbürgermeister). The district councils are advisory only.

Dortmund is often called the ''Herzkammer der [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]'' (roughly translated as "heartland of the Social democrats"), after the politically dominant party in the city. During the Nazi era (1933–1945), mayors were installed by the Nazi Party. After World War II, the military government of the British occupation zone installed a new mayor and a municipal constitution modeled on that of British cities. The first major elected by the population of Dortmund was [[Fritz Henßler]]. Since the end of the war, the SPD has held a plurality in the city council, except for the period from 1999 to 2004.

===Mayor===
[[File:2020 Dortmund mayoral election (2nd round).svg|thumb|350px|Results of the second round of the 2020 mayoral election]]
The current mayor of Dortmund is [[Thomas Westphal]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD), who was elected in 2020.

The most recent mayoral election was held on 13 September 2020, with a runoff held on 27 September, and the results were as follows:

==Cityscape==

===City centre===
[[File:Dortmund Panorama.jpg|thumb|Dortmund with RWE-Tower and churches of Reinoldi, Petri and Marien on the right]]
Dortmund's city centre offers a picture full of contrasts. Historic buildings like [[Altes Stadthaus, Dortmund|Altes Stadthaus]] or the Krügerpassage rub shoulders with post-war architecture like Gesundheitshaus and concrete constructions with Romanesque churches like the [[Reinoldikirche]] and the [[Marienkirche, Dortmund|Marienkirche]]. The near-complete destruction of Dortmund's city centre during World War&nbsp;II (98%) has resulted in a varied architectural landscape. The reconstruction of the city centre followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. The downtown of Dortmund still retains the outline of the medieval city. A ring road marks the former city wall, and the [[Hellweg|Westen-/Ostenhellweg]], part of a medieval salt trading route, is still the major (pedestrian) street bisecting the city centre.

Thus, the inner city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the "Wiederaufbauzeit" (era of reconstruction), for example the opera house are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/stadtportraet/stadtgeschichte/20jahrhundert/wiederaufbau/|title=Wiederaufbau – 20. Jahrhundert – "heute" – Stadtgeschichte – Stadtportrait – Leben in Dortmund – Stadtportal dortmund.de|website=Dortmund.de|access-date=20 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202233213/https://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/stadtportraet/stadtgeschichte/20jahrhundert/wiederaufbau/|archive-date=2 February 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Urban districts===
Unlike the Dortmund city centre, much of the inner districts around the old medieval centre escaped damage in the second world war and post war redevelopment.

====Kreuzviertel====
[[File:Kreuzstraße.JPG|thumb|Typical Wilhelminian style houses]]
The [[Kreuzviertel]] is characterised by old buildings, the majority of which come from the turn of the 20th century (1884 to 1908). Over 80% of all housing in this area was constructed before 1948, with the oldest building the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts still standing being from 1896. In the [[Second World War]], relatively few buildings were destroyed in comparison to other areas of the city. Today, [[Kreuzviertel]] forms a nearly homogeneous historic building area. Over 100 buildings remain protected as historic monuments, like the Kreuzkirche at Kreuzstraße and the first concrete church in Germany St.-Nicolai. Nowadays the Kreuzviertel is a trendy district with pubs, restaurants, cafés, galleries, and little shops. Moreover, local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighbourhood have reinforced a budding sense of community and artistic expression. The West park is the green lung of the Kreuzviertel and in the months between May and October a centre of the student urban life. The district has the highest real estate prices in Dortmund.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.capital.de/immobilien-kompass/dortmund.html/ |title=Mietspiegel und Immobilienpreise von Dortmund &#124; Capital |access-date=29 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228181111/https://www.capital.de/immobilien-kompass/dortmund.html#Szeneviertel |archive-date=28 December 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Even today many artists choose Kreuzviertel as their residence: [[Sasha (German singer)|Sascha Schmitz]], [[Christina Hammer]], and players of [[Borussia Dortmund]].

==== Nordstadt ====
[[File:Nordstadt_Dortmund_Hafenviertel.jpg|thumb|Dockland – young restaurant and bars scene]]
The northern downtown part of Dortmund called Nordstadt, situated in a territory of {{cvt|14.42|km2}} is shaped by a colorful variety of cultures. As the largest homogeneous old building area in [[Ruhr]] the Nordstadt is a melting pot of different people of different countries and habits just a few steps from the city center. The Nordstadt is an industrial [[urban area]] that was mainly developed in the 19th century to serve the [[Westfalenhütte]] steelworks, port and rail freight depot. All of the residents live in a densely populated 300 hectare area (the most densely populated residential area in the state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] with steelworks, port and railway lines acting as physical barriers cutting off the area from the city centre and other residential districts).<ref name="Dortmund.de">{{cite web|url=http://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/stadtbezirke/stbzportal_innenstadtnord/leben_in_in//|title=Die Stadt im Wiederaufbau|website=Dortmund.de}}</ref>

The area has been badly affected by the deindustrialisation of these heavy industries, with the target area developing a role as the home for growing numbers of immigrants and socially disadvantaged groups partly because of the availability of cheaper (although poor quality) accommodation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/dortmund-boosts-efforts-to-integrate-bulgarian-and-romanian-immigrants-a-911619.html// |title=Dortmund Boosts Efforts to Integrate Bulgarian and Romanian Immigrants - SPIEGEL ONLINE |access-date=2016-04-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330025233/http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/dortmund-boosts-efforts-to-integrate-bulgarian-and-romanian-immigrants-a-911619.html |archive-date=30 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Nevertheless, two parks – Fredenbaumpark and Hoeschpark – are situated there. There is also much equipment for children to spend their free time. For example, the 35 meters high Big Tipi, which was brought in from the [[Expo 2000]] in Hanover. All of that should attract families to settle in, but low prices of apartments and a variety of renting offers speak for the contrary. This developed into the youngest population of Dortmund is living and created a district with art house cinemas to ethnic stores, from exotic restaurants to student pubs.<ref name="Dortmund.de"/>

The Borsigplatz is probably one of the best known squares in Germany. Ballspielverein [[Borussia Dortmund]] was founded nearby, north-east of the main railway station. The streets radiating outward to form a star shape, the sycamore in the middle of the square and the tramline running diagonally across the square give Borsigplatz its very own flair.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bvb.de/eng/BVB/History/1909//|title=BVB 09 – Back to our History – 1909 – Borussia Dortmund – bvb.de|website=Bvb.de}}</ref>

====Kaiserviertel====
[[File:Dortmund Kaiserstraßenviertel.jpg|thumb|Cherry Blossom Avenue]]
The Kaiserstraßen District is located east of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the [[Westenhellweg]]. In this district numerous magnificent buildings from the 1900s and new buildings from the 1950s are located next to the heritage-protected State Mining Office Dortmund, several Courts, Consulate and the East Cemetery. The district is characterize by the employee of the Amtsgericht, Landgericht (the first and second instances of ordinary jurisdiction) and the Prison.

Today the historical Kaiserbrunnen and the entrance sign for Kaiserstraße are important starting points for a tour to the popular shopping district. The Moltkestreet also known as the Cherry Blossom Avenue, became famous after photographers started posting pictures of blooming trees. Every spring, usually in April, the street in the Kaiserstraßen district is booming with pink blossoms and attracts tourists.

====Unionviertel====
[[File:Unionviertel Dortmund.jpg|thumb|Rheinische Straße]]
The Union District is located west of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the [[Westenhellweg]]. For a long time, the neighbourhood at the Dortmunder U and along the Rheinische Straße was marked by vacancy and social distortion due to structural change. Today it is developing an inspiring young artist scene, with more and more students thanks to cheaper apartments near the university and a vibrant gastronomy. This development benefits strongly from the new, widely visible beacon, the art and creative centre Dortmunder U, opened in 2010. Yet, for a time, it was mainly the Union Gewerbehof activists and other single stakeholders who initiated change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-c-c-e.de/kreativquartiere-ruhr.html|title=ecce – european centre for creative economy: Kreativ.Quartiere Ruhr|website=E-c-c-e.de}}</ref>

====Hörde on Lake Phoenix====
[[File:Dortmund Hoerde Hoerder Burg 05.jpg|thumb|Hörde castle]]
Hörde is borough in the south of the city of Dortmund. Originally Hörde was a separate town (until 1929) and was founded by the Counts of Mark in opposition to their principal enemy, the town of Dortmund. In 1388, the "Großen Dortmunder Fehde" (great feud of Dortmund) took place, where the city of Dortmund battled against the alliance of surrounding towns. The struggle ended in 1390, with defeat for Hörde and its allies of [[Herdecke]], [[Witten]], [[Bochum]], [[Castrop]], [[Lünen]], [[Unna]], and [[Schwerte]]. Today Hörde is a part of Dortmund with restored old buildings combined with modern architecture. The Hörder Burg (Hörde castle) was built in the 12th century and is located in the east of the town, close to the [[Emscher]] and Lake Phoenix.

Lake Phoenix was one of the largest urban redevelopment projects in [[Europe]]. On the area of the former blast furnace and steel plant site of [[ThyssenKrupp]] newly formed and developed a new urban resident and recreational area {{convert|3|km|mi|frac=2|abbr=off|sp=us}} from the city centre of Dortmund. The development of the Phoenix See area cost €;170 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eglv.de/en/emschergenossenschaft/emscher-conversion/the-new-emscher-valley/phoenix-lake/|title=Phoenix Lake|website=Eglv.de|access-date=17 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190212014936/http://www.eglv.de/en/emschergenossenschaft/emscher-conversion/the-new-emscher-valley/phoenix-lake/|archive-date=12 February 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> The lake is 1.2&nbsp;km long directed to east–west and 320 meters wide in north–south direction. The water surface area of 24 acres is larger than the [[Hamburg]] [[Alster]]. Lake Phoenix is a shallow water lake with a depth of 3 to 4 meters and a capacity of around 600,000 cubic meters. Attractive high priced residential areas were thus created on the southern and northern sides of the Lake. On the western lakeside, the existing district centre of Hörde is enlarged by a city port and a mixed functional urban area.

Companies with agencies and offices on the lakefront include:

*[[Zalando]]
*[[HSBC Trinkaus]]
*[[German Handball Association]]
*[[Handball-Bundesliga|Handball-Bundesliga (HBL)]]
*{{lang|de|Sparkassenakademie Nordrhein-Westfalen}}, a training organization of the [[Sparkasse (Germany)|Sparkassen]]
*[[Mircosonic]]

The finished sole is primarily fed by groundwater and unpolluted rainwater from the new building sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dortmund.de/en/leisure_and_culture/phoenix_see_1/index.html|title=Phoenix-See – Leisure & Culture – dortmund.de|website=Dortmund.de}}</ref>
The River [[Emscher]] flows through an embanked riverbed without direct link to the Lake. Together with the renatured Emscher, the Lake forms a water landscape of 33 hectares, which, as a linking area, is an important element of the Emscher landscape park. The renaturation of the Emscher River is managed by the public [[water board]] [[Emschergenossenschaft]]. The financial frame is 4.5 billion Euro and the aim is to finish the main work by 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.umwelt.nrw.de/umweltschutz-umweltwirtschaft/umwelt-und-wasser/abwasser/emscherumbau/|title=webpage Environment Ministry|access-date=14 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223023515/https://www.umwelt.nrw.de/umweltschutz-umweltwirtschaft/umwelt-und-wasser/abwasser/emscherumbau/|archive-date=23 December 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Transportation==

===Road transport===
[[File:Schnettkerbruecke West.jpg|thumb|The Ruhrschnellweg Section East Dortmund]]
Dortmund also serves as a major European and German crossroads for the Autobahnsystem. The [[Bundesautobahn 40|Ruhrschnellweg]] follows old Hanseatic trade routes to connect the city with the other metropolises of the [[Ruhr Area]]. It crosses the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-German border as a continuation of the Dutch [[A67 motorway (Netherlands)|A67]] and crosses the [[Rhine]], leads through the [[Ruhr valley]] toward [[Bochum]], becoming B&nbsp;1 ([[Bundesstraße 1|Bundesstraße&nbsp;1]]) at the Kreuz Dortmund West and eventually merging into the A&nbsp;44 near [[Holzwickede]]. It has officially been named Ruhrschnellweg (Ruhr Fast Way), but locals usually call it Ruhrschleichweg (Ruhr Crawling Way) or "the Ruhr area's longest parking lot". According to ''Der Spiegel'', it is the most congested motorway in Germany.

Connections to more distant parts of Germany are maintained by Autobahn routes [[Bundesautobahn 1|A1]] and [[Bundesautobahn 2|A2]], which traverse the north and east city limits and meet at the [[Kamener Kreuz]] interchange north-east of Dortmund.
In combination with the Autobahn [[Bundesautobahn 45|A45]] to the west these form the [[Dortmund Beltway]] (''Dortmunder Autobahnring'').

===Cycling===
Cycling in Dortmund is supported by urban planners – an extensive network of cycle paths exists which had its beginnings in the 1980s. Dortmund was admitted to the German "Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle-Friendly Cities and Municipalities in NRW" (AGFS) on August 8, 2007. Dortumund is connected to a number of long-distance cycle paths and a [[Bike freeway]] called the ''Radschnellweg Ruhr'' (Ruhr Area Fast Cycle Path).

===Rail transport===
[[File:HBFDo.JPG|thumb|Dortmund central railway station]]
As with most communes in the Ruhr area, local transport is carried out by a local, publicly owned company for transport within the city, the [[DB Regio]] subsidiary of {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Bahn]]|italic=no}} for regional transport and {{lang|de|Deutsche Bahn|italic=no}} itself for long-distance journeys. The local carrier, [[Dortmunder Stadtwerke]] (DSW21), is a member of the [[Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr]] (VRR) association of public transport companies in the Ruhr area, which provides a uniform fare structure in the whole region. Within the VRR region, tickets are valid on lines of all members as well as DB's [[railway line]]s (except the high-speed [[InterCity]] and [[Intercity-Express]] networks) and can be bought at ticket machines and service centres of DSW21, all other members of VRR, and DB.

The central train station ([[Dortmund Hauptbahnhof]]) is the third largest long-distance traffic junction in Germany. Dortmund has a railway service with {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Bahn]]|italic=no}} [[InterCity]] and [[InterCityExpress|ICE]]-trains stopping at ''[[Dortmund Hauptbahnhof]]'' (Dortmund Main Station). ICE and [[Thalys|TGV Thalys]] high-speed trains link Dortmund with [[Amsterdam]], Brussels (in 2h 30) and Paris (in 3h 50). There are frequent ICE trains to other German cities, including [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Berlin]] and other cities in the Rhein-Ruhr Region.

=== Public transportation ===
For public transportation, the city has an extensive [[Dortmund Stadtbahn|Stadtbahn]] and bus system. The Stadtbahn has eight lines (U41 to U47 and U49) serving Dortmund and the large suburb of [[Lünen]] in the north. The trains that run on the line are in fact lightrails as many lines travel along a track in the middle of the street instead of underground further from the city centre. The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs at 5 to 10 minute intervals. On Sundays the trains run at a 15-minute interval. In April 2008, the newly constructed east–west underground light rail line was opened, completing the underground service in the city centre and replacing the last [[tram]]s on the surface.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ruhrnachrichten.de/nachrichten/nrw/art1544,243917|title=Neuer U-Bahn-Tunnel: keine Straßenbahn mehr in Dortmunder City|access-date=2008-08-28|publisher=Oliver Volmerich|date=25 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914092307/http://www.ruhrnachrichten.de/nachrichten/nrw/art1544,243917|archive-date=14 September 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

A number of bus lines complete the Dortmund public transport system. [[Night service (public transport)|Night buses]] replace Stadtbahn services between 1:30 am and 7:30 am on weekends and public holidays. The central junction for the night bus service is Reinoldikirche in the city centre, where all night bus lines start and end.

The [[H-Bahn]] at [[Technical University of Dortmund]] is a hanging monorail built specifically to shuttle passengers between the university's two campuses,<ref>{{cite web|title=H-Bahn – Route map|url=http://www.h-bahn.info/en/index.php|access-date=2009-06-03}}</ref> which are now also flanked by research laboratories and other high-tech corporations and startups.
