'''San Carlos''', officially the '''City of San Carlos''' ({{langx|ceb|Dakbayan sa San Carlos}}; {{langx|hil|Dakbanwa/Syudad sang San Carlos}}; {{langx|fil|Lungsod ng San Carlos}}), is a second-class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Negros Occidental]] in the [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 132,650 people.{{PH census|current}}

The municipality's status was elevated to city on July 1, 1960, per [[Republic Acts of the Philippines|Republic Act]] No. 2643<ref name="RA2643">{{cite web |title=Republic Act No. 2643 – An Act Creating the City of San Carlos |url=https://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1960/ra_2643_1960.html |website=The LawPhil Project|publisher=Arellano Law Foundation |access-date=November 6, 2019 |date=June 18, 1960}}</ref> and Presidential Proclamation No. 685 s. 1960.<ref name="PP685">{{cite web |title=Proclamation No. 685, s. 1960 – Declaring July 1, 1960, as The Date for The Formal Organization of The City of San Carlos |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1960/06/29/proclamation-no-685-s-1960/ |website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|publisher=Republic of the Philippines |access-date=November 6, 2019 |date=June 29, 1960}}</ref>

==History==
===Pre-Spanish and Spanish colonization===
San Carlos City was formerly named ''Nabingkalan'', deriving its name from ''Nabingka'', the daughter of a chieftain of the [[Aeta|Negrito]] settlement in the area, who ruled the {{Lang|es|[[barrio]]}} during the early part of the 17th century. She was famous for her loveliness and mental and physical prowess. After her death, the people mourned for two years, and to perpetuate her memory, named the barrio after her. The settlement was later bought by Carlos Apurado from [[Badian, Cebu]], who with the help of fellow pioneers developed the settlement into a thriving [[Christian]] village. In 1856, [[Buglas]] (Negros) Island, as a politico-military province under the [[Spanish Empire]], was divided into two provinces, west Negros under [[Iloilo]] and east Negros under [[Cebu]]. Nabingkalan was under the jurisdiction of [[Calatrava, Negros Occidental|Calatrava]] municipality in Iloilo. Don Emilio Saravia, the first political-military governor in the island during the Spanish era, renamed the {{Lang|es|barrio}} and established it as a {{lang|es|pueblo}}.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

A [[Christian mission|mission]] belonging to the municipality of Calatrava was created in 1895, although since 1891 a [[Religious (Western Christianity)|religious]] had been assigned to it. The number of inhabitants at the time was 1,100, living in the mountainous areas rather than the coast where the modern village is located. [[Priest|Father]] Pedro Chivite was assigned to the mission. It was vacated during the [[Philippine Revolution|Revolution]], and in 1904 Father Eusebio Valderrama took charge of it. With the help of Fathers Ángel Quintana, Juan Lorenzo, and Vicente Vázquez, all the towns of the coast from [[Guihulngan]] to [[Escalante, Negros Occidental|Escalante]] were attended to. Since then, it has been administered to by the Fathers. According to a church chronicle from 1925, what was a poor and depopulated village in 1897 was by then one of the most important towns in Negros Occidental. In that year, the city had an estimated population of 30,000.<ref name="HistRuiz">{{cite book |last=Ruiz de Santa Eulalia |first=Licinio |url=https://studylib.es/doc/8619695/sinopsis-hist%C3%B3rica---agustinos-recoletos |title=Sinopsis Historica de la Provincia de San Nicolas de Tolentino de las Islas Filipinas de la Orden de Agustinos Descalzos |date=20 July 1925 |publisher=[[University of Santo Tomas]] |volume=2 |location=Manila |pages=167–168 |language=es |trans-title=Historical Synopsis of the Province of San Nicolas de Tolentino of the Philippine Islands of the Order of Discalced Augustinians |access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref> The land began to be cultivated when a Spaniard who observed the fertility of the land built a small [[sugarcane]] farm. Seeing the good results obtained, others joined in cultivating the land, modern machines were installed, and it became one of the most productive villages on the island. In 1889 there were four [[Estate (land)|estates]] and in 1897 there were 16, mainly owned by Spaniards.<ref name="HistRuiz" />

In 1856 Negros was raised to the category of a politico-military province, Saravia being its first governor. It was during his term that several towns of Negros Occidental, including San Isido, San Carlos,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2014/11/04/proclamation-no-900-s-2014/ |title=Proclamation No. 900, s. 2014 – Declaring Tuesday, 4 November 2014, as a Special (Non-Working) Day in the City of San Carlos, Negros Occidental |date=November 4, 2014 |website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines |access-date=June 18, 2019}}</ref> and Calatrava were established.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/ajb5835.0001.001.umich.edu#page/217 |title=Census of the Philippine Islands 1918 |publisher=Census Office of the Philippine Islands |year=1920 |location=Library of Congress |pages=217}}</ref>

San Carlos prospered through the years, however the village lost its {{lang|es|pueblo}} status in 1890, when Negros Island was divided into [[Negros Occidental]] and [[Negros Oriental]], and the village was recorded as an {{Lang|es|arrabal}} or {{Lang|es|barrio}} of Calatrava (Hilub-ang).{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

===American colonization===

[[File:San Carlos Cathedral, Negros Occidental.jpg|thumb|left|The [[San Carlos Cathedral (Negros Occidental)|San Carlos Borromeo Cathedral]] in San Carlos, built during the American period]]

During the first years of the [[American occupation of the Philippines]], the economic and social pace of the activities of the people were gauged by the movements of the large landholders and Spaniards in the lowlands. In 1903, Filipinos were first allowed to elect their own leaders. In 1912, when a sugar central was constructed, the economic life of the people was greatly enhanced. Political activities, however, were closely connected to Calatrava until 1925, when it was organized into a municipality.

San Carlos Milling Company of San Carlos erected one of the first and only modern [[sugarcane mill]]s in the Philippines, and has engaged in sugarcane cultivation and sugar production. The capacity of the mill is 1000 tons of cane per day, which results in 125 tons of centrifugal sugar. It was completed at the end of 1913 at a cost of about one million dollars, and the first cane ground was from the 1914 crop.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Something about sugar, its history, growth, manufacture and distribution |last=George |first=Rolph |date=1917 |ol=7141860M }}</ref>

Per a 1903 act of the Philippine Commission, the municipality consisted of its present territory and that of Calatrava's, with the seat of the municipal government at San Carlos.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/actsphilippinec01unkngoog#page/n524 |title=Acts of the Philippine Commission. (Acts Nos. 425–949, inclusive) |publisher=Bureau of Insular Affairs, War Department Volume VIII |year=1904 |location=Library of Congress |pages=482}}</ref>

In 1920, the municipality comprised the {{lang|es|barrios}} Antabayan, Cubay, Euzcasa, Looc, Malalamban, San Juan, Santa Filomena, Sitio Banatic, Tigbon, and Varconia.<ref name="University of Michigan">{{cite web |last1=Villamor |first1=Ignacio |last2=Buencamino |first2=Felipe |title=Census of the Philippine Islands taken under the direction of the Philippine Legislature in the year 1918 |url=https://archive.org/details/ajb5835.appe.001.umich.edu/page/410 |website=archive.org/ |location=Manila |publisher=Bureau of Printing |access-date=March 8, 2019 |ref=University of Michigan}}</ref>

[[World War I]] encouraged the people of San Carlos to grow more sugar-producing crops. After the [[armistice]] in 1917, the planters who produced more sugar had their wealth greatly increased because of the new price of sugar never before enjoyed by the planters. During the war, many men of the municipality volunteered to fight for the [[United States]], but a few months later were sent back home because of the armistice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===World War II===
San Carlos was actively involved on the war efforts against Imperial Japan during [[World War II]].  A month after the surrender of Negros to the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Imperial Forces]], the [[guerrilla movement]] began in San Carlos and Calatrava. As early as June 15, 1942, guerilla units under the leadership of Captain Eugenio Antonio, Jr. and Lieutenants Leonardo Marane and Alfredo Valdivia, assisted by [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] soldiers, began operations against the Japanese. Pitched battles were fought within populated areas. Despite the presence of the U.S. forces under Major Edward McClenahan, separate guerrilla units were scattered in the area under different commanders as they were unable to effectively establish a formal chain-of-command among the different factions.

Upon the return of some local [[USAFFE]] officers to San Carlos, the guerrilla movement was formally organized into fighting units under USAFFE Captains Catalino D. Rivera, Eugenio Antonio, Jr. and Loreto Y. Apuhin Sr., and with Lieutenants Florencio C. Yap and Andres L. Arrogante, the bands of guerrillas in San Carlos were consolidated under one command. Young men in their early teens joined the ranks and fought face-to-face against the Japanese.

In March 1945, the [[Philippine Commonwealth]] forces under the 7th, 71st and 72nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, 7th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary and local guerrilla units under the command of Colonel [[Ernesto Mata]], attacked the Japanese garrison in the compound of San Carlos Milling Company and succeeded in driving away the Japanese Army, at the cost of the life of Lt. Valdivia.

On October 10, 1945, President [[Sergio Osmeña]] appointed Eugenio Antonio as Acting Mayor of San Carlos and Anacleto Facturan as Acting Vice Mayor.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/MOPVol1and2SergioOsmena/VOL1-2_001-282_OSMENA#page/n195/mode/2up |title=Messages of the President Sergio Osmena 1944–1946 |website=archive.org |archive-url=https://archive.org/stream/MOPVol1and2SergioOsmena/VOL1-2_001-282_OSMENA#page/n195 |archive-date=2016-06-02}}</ref>

===Post-war period===
The first post-war election in the municipality resulted in a [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal]] government. In the 1953 elections, the [[Nacionalista Party]] wrested power from the Liberals.

====Cityhood====
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
By Virtue of Republic Act No. 2643, the Municipality of San Carlos was converted into a city on July 1, 1960.<ref name="RA2643"/> The city inherited from the municipality numerous improvements, introduced by the last municipal administration under Mayor Sofronio Carmona.

==Geography==
[[File:San Carlos Negros Occidental Philippines.jpg|thumb|San Carlos highlands landscape]]

Located along the northeastern coast touching the [[Tañon Strait]], San Carlos City is located along the boundary of two provinces, [[Negros Occidental]] and [[Negros Oriental]]. The city is also used as a departure point to [[Cebu City]]. It has a {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} coastline, of which some parts are covered with mangroves. The city has a deep natural harbor protected from inclement weather by the island of Refugio, also known as Sipaway. Due to these aspects, the [[Philippine Ports Authority]] has chosen the San Carlos City port from among other ports in the province for its expansion program in 1998 which include the reclamation of four hectares of sea to accommodate various port buildings, facilities and container vans, an extension on the east side for two [[roll-on/roll-off]] (RO-RO) vessels and the extension of the length of the port to {{convert|242.50|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It is {{convert|87|km}} east of Bacolod, via the [[Negros Occidental Eco-Tourism Highway]] (N69), and {{convert|168|km}} from Dumaguete, the capital of [[Negros Oriental]].

The [[Pintaflores Festival]] was born out of the city's search for a cultural identity and tradition. In 1992 after successfully holding two activities with the [[Nabingkalan Tattoo Festival]] and the [[Dances of Flowers]] as highlights of the city fiesta, the idea of blending the two concepts to come up with a presentation that could be considered the city's very own started what today is one of the most popular street dancing festivals in the region, the Pintaflores Festival.
[[File:Pintaflores Queen.jpg|thumb|right|The Pintaflores Festival]]
{{lang|es|Pintaflores}} was coined from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] words {{lang|es|pintados}} ({{lit|painted ones}}), the concept behind the Nabingkalan Tattoo Festival, and {{lang|es|flores}} ({{lit|flowers}}), the theme of the Dances of Flowers. The {{lang|es|pintaflores}} [[street dancing]] and ritual competition are the highlights of the annual festival every November 3–5.

It features rhythmic dances and dance dramas of life and death and the triumph of good against evil that depict the people's thanksgiving and merriment, abundant blessings and success. As part of the {{lang|es|pintados}} tradition, the faces, arms, bodies and legs of the dancers are painted with flowers to express gratitude to man and his environment.

The street dancing culminates in a dance ritual performed at the city auditorium. Different dance steps and musical accompaniment add to the thrill of the competition. The human flower formation is another part of the ritual which is created by [[choreographed]] dancers.

[[Colegio de Santo Tomas – Recoletos]] high school students bested seasoned contestants to land third place in the free interpretation category in the heavily contested Sinulog festival in Cebu City in January 1993. In April of the same year, the group won the championship in [[Panaad sa Negros Festival|Panaad Sa Negros]], a province-wide cultural festival in Negros Occidental.

Represented by barangays II and Quezon, the Pintaflores street dancing contingent won first prize in Panaad Sa Negros in 1996. The same group with the participation of barangay Ermita secured the championship again in 1997 and the fifth prize in Sinulog festival 1998.

In the 1998 Panaad sa Negros, the Pintaflores group composed of dancers from barangays Punao and Palampas and the City Hospital appeared in the fiesta presentation as guest performers. In the 1999 festival the group, represented by elementary school children, continued its unbeatable streak by emerging champions, consequently reaping the [[Hall of Fame]] award for topping the fiesta presentation event in four consecutive years.

Having established a name in street dancing, Pintaflores danced performers in such places as [[Iloilo City]] in 1996 and [[Roxas City]] in 1997 among the best of the best in the region, and in [[Canlaon]] and [[Victorias]] in 1999 as the best in the province.

Pintaflores has evolved as a new breed of dancers emerged with the 1996 launch of Pintaflores Bata or Pinta Bata, a street dancing and ritual competition among elementary school children.

After five years and many awards, including the Panaad sa Negros Hall of Fame awards, the word Pintaflores, like ''Daan Sa Kaunlaran'' and the Homelot program, has become another byword of the creativity of San Carloseños.
