it was originally a [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christian]] town made up of mostly Syriac Orthodox, Catholics, and Protestants. The spoken language of Midyat was until recently modern [[Turoyo language|Aramaic (Surayt)]] and the town has throughout history been considered the capital of the [[Tur Abdin]] region, the heartland of Syriac Christianity.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.shmayaa.com/en/about-midyat.php | title=About Midyat / Shmayaa Hotel · Midyat / Mardin }}</ref>

==History==
[[Assyria]]n tablets from [[9th century BC]] refer to Midyat as ''[[Matiate]]''. During a campaign in [[879 BC]], the Assyrian king [[Assurnasirpal II]] and his army marched through the city, staying for two nights. His successor, the Assyrian king [[Shalmaneser III]] did the same in [[845 BC]]. The tablets also described how [[Assurnasirpal II]] erected a monument in the city, which remains to be found.{{sfnp|Radner|2006|pp=287-299}} The archaeological site [[Matiate]] is located below the town and is assumed to have been in use for about 1,900 years and at its peak been inhabited by up to 70,000 people.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2022-04-26 |title=Türkei: Archäologen entdecken riesige Untergrundstadt Matiate in Midyat |language=de |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |url=https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/tuerkei-archaeologen-entdecken-riesige-untergrundstadt-matiate-in-midyat-a-064a87d4-a820-4aa6-b0cf-c7739294c579 |access-date=2022-04-30 |issn=2195-1349}}</ref>

==Demographics==
[[File:MuttergotteskircheHah.JPG|thumb|[[Syriac Orthodox Church]] in Midyat.]]
Midyat, in [[Diyarbekir vilayet]], was the only town in the [[Ottoman Empire]] with an ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] majority, although denominationally divided between the  [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], and Assyrian Protestants.{{sfn|Gaunt|2015|p=87}}

On the eve of the [[First World War]], various sources report a total population of about 8,000 people. Most of them being Syriac-Orthodox Christians, plus some Protestants, Syriac-Catholics, Chaldeans, Armenians, and Muslims (mostly [[Kurds]]). The [[Armenian Apostolic Patriarchate of Constantinople]] recorded 1,452 Armenians in the kaza of Midyat before the First World War.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kaza Midyat / Mëḏyaḏ - ܡܕܝܕ |url=https://virtual-genocide-memorial.de/region/the-six-provinces/diyarbakir-vilayet/sancak-mardin/kaza-midyat/ |access-date=2023-09-18 |website=Virtual Genocide Memorial |language=en-US}}</ref>

Midyat is an historic centre of the Assyrian in Turkey, and as late as the [[Assyrian genocide]] in 1915 they constituted the majority of the city's population. During the early 20th century, the Assyrian population of the city started to gradually diminish due to emigration, but the community was still very large. The Assyrian of [[Tur Abdin]] were the only significant population of Christians outside of [[Istanbul]], until 1979, when panic ensued over an act of war and an exodus of local Christians overtook the city as a result, because a mayor and major Assyrian figure in Turabdin of the city of Kerboran, now named [[Dargecit]], was assassinated and replaced with a Kurdish representative against the peoples will. The Assyrian up until then had control over the local government, and could therefore unify to resist threats. Panic ensued as the local Muslim population made a symbolic declaration of war against the Assyrian people and soon after the takeover, local [[Mhallami]] and Kurdish inhabitants started immigrating into the traditionally Assyrian areas, causing a demographic shift which – along with the start of the [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1978–present)|Turkish-Kurdish conflict]] a few years later in 1984 – sounded a death toll to the community not only here, but in all of [[Tur Abdin]]. From a 1975 population of 50,000 comprising 10% of Mardin Province's demographic structure:<ref>530,000 people recorded in Mardin province census, 1975. Turabdin is mostly in Mardin province.</ref> barely 2,000 were left by the end of the conflict in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atour.com/news/assyria/20000531n.html|title=Turkey Destroys Assyrian Villages|publisher=Turkish Daily News|date=August 29, 1996|access-date=January 4, 2018}}</ref> Now only around 3–5,000 live in Tur Abdin, with the other 15–17,000 living in Istanbul and other still functioning Syriac Diocese like [[Adiyaman]],<ref>"Mor Malki Ürek". soc-wus.org.</ref> [[Harput]], and [[Diyarbakir]].

The churches and houses belonging to the Christians have been preserved although many of them are empty, with their owners living away in Europe. At present 500 Assyrian Christians live in Midyat, and they have been joined by 100–300 Syriac refugees fleeing the [[Syrian Civil War]] who have settled in the city and region according to different estimates,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20140127171559.htm|title=Syria's Assyrian Christians Find Refuge With Turkish Neighbours|publisher=Assyrian International News Agency|date=January 27, 2014|access-date=January 4, 2018}}</ref> and comprise 1% of the population of Midyat. There are five churches in the city, and all are Syriac.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://travelingbydefault.blogspot.com.au/2013/05/the-search-for-5-churches-of-midyat.html|title=The search for the 5 churches of Midyat|publisher=Traveling by default|author=Jimmy Jimmie|date=May 12, 2013|access-date=January 4, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415043952/https://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Middle_East/Turkey/Midyat-1829398/Things_To_Do-Midyat-TG-C-1.html|title=Most Recent Things to Do in Midyat|date=March 28, 2013|access-date=January 4, 2018|archive-date=April 15, 2016|url=https://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Middle_East/Turkey/Midyat-1829398/Things_To_Do-Midyat-TG-C-1.html}}</ref>

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Midyat was divided into 12 districts (The number 12 was possibly an influence from the 12 tribes of Israel). 11 of which were [[Assyrian people|Syriac]] districts and one Muslim. These names still exist in the old population registration.<ref>[https://search.worldcat.org/title/941973611 Fehmi Bargello, Min hemstad Midyat (My hometown Midyat), 2015]</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Midyat Silver Jewelry 1310249 Nevit.jpg|thumb| [[filigree|Telkari]] silver jewelry from Midyat, a popular export and handicraft]]
Midyat is the regional center of commerce for the district, and is one of the largest cities in [[Mardin Province]]. Similarly with Mardin, the city is known for its Syriac handicrafts such as carpets, towels and other cloth goods. More specific to the city is its Syriac silver crafts called [[filigree|telkari]], which are handcrafted filigreed ornaments. In December 2023, the [[Midyat Telkâri Museum]] was opened, exhibiting a wide variety of works from the [[Roman Empire]], [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Ottoman Empire]] and the Republican periods.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ntv.com.tr/n-life/gezi/dunyanin-ilk-telkri-muzesi-midyatta,PKcqqaR6xUmXH6kFB2t6ng |newspaper=[[NTV (Turkey)|NTV]] |title=Dünyanın ilk Telkâri Müzesi Midyat'ta |date=10 December 2023 |language=tr |accessdate=25 March 2024 }}</ref> To the east of the city there is a winery that makes traditional Syriac wine: a wine native to the region. Another staple in the Midyat market is its [[bulgur]], which is a cereal food derived from wheat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkeyfromtheinside.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=295:mdyat&catid=42:places-to-go|title=Midyat|access-date=January 4, 2018|publisher=Turkey from the Inside}}</ref>

==Climate==
Midyat, part of the province of Mardin, has a [[semi-arid climate]] with very hot and dry summers and cold, wet, and occasionally snowy winters. Temperatures in summer usually increase to {{convert|40|–|50|C|F}} due to Mardin being situated right next to the [[Syria–Turkey border|border with Syria]]. Snowfall is quite common between the months of December and March, snowing for a week or two. Mardin has over 3,000 hours of sun per year. The highest recorded temperature is 48.8&nbsp;°C.
