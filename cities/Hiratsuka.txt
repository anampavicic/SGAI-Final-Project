==History==
The area around Hiratsuka has been settled since prehistoric times, and mention of the area as part of ancient [[Ōsumi District, Kanagawa|Ōsumi District]], [[Sagami Province]] is found in [[Nara period]] records. From the [[Heian period]] through [[Kamakura period]], the area was divided into ''[[shōen]]'' controlled by various [[samurai]] clans and in the [[Sengoku period]] was the site of several battles between the [[later Hōjō clan]] of Odawara and the [[Miura clan]]. After the defeat of the Odawara at the [[Siege of Odawara (1590)|Battle of Odawara]] by [[Hideyoshi Toyotomi]], the area came under the control of [[Ieyasu Tokugawa]], who built a summer palace (the ''Nakahara Goten'') in 1596 at the site now occupied by the Hiratsuka City Nakahara Elementary/Primary School. Hiratsuka was retained as ''[[tenryō]]'' territory after the establishment of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], and flourished as [[Hiratsuka-juku]], a [[shukuba|post town]] on the [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō]] connecting [[Edo]] with [[Kyoto]]. As the 7th station, it is often depicted in the series of [[ukiyo-e]] about the [[53 Stations of the Tōkaidō]] made among others by artists such [[Hokusai]] and [[Hiroshige]].

After the [[Meiji Restoration]], Hiratsuka town was founded on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the municipalities system, as part of the new [[Naka District, Kanagawa|Naka District]] within Kanagawa Prefecture. It merged with neighboring Suma Town on April 1, 1929, and was proclaimed Hiratsuka City on April 1, 1932.

Prior to [[World War II]], Hiratsuka was the location of the {{nihongo|[[Hiratsuka Navy Ammunitions Arsenal]]|平塚海軍火薬廠}} of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] and {{nihongo|[[Japan International Aircraft Industries]]|日本国際航空工業|}}, a [[Nissan]] group military aircraft factory. Hiratsuka was largely destroyed on  July 16, 1945, during the [[Bombing of Hiratsuka in World War II]]. Due to its strategic location and wide beaches, it was also one of the targets for the [[Operation Downfall#Coronet|planned invasion of Japan]] during the final stages of World War II.

The city quickly rebuilt after the war, annexing several neighboring villages in the mid-1950s to attain its current area. The population exceeded 200,000 by 2001 and Hiratsuka became a [[Special cities of Japan|special city]] with increased autonomy from the central government. The current mayor is the independent Katsuhiro Ochai  (落合克宏) who was elected April 24, 2011, and assumed office on April 30. Previously he had served two terms on the Hiratsuka city council and as council chairperson for the majority of the second term.  Ochai succeeded Ritsuko Okura, the city's first female mayor, who served from 2003 to 2011.

==Government==
Hiratsuka has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 26 members. Hiratsuka contributes three members to the Kanagawa Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Kanagawa 15th district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Hiratsuka has a mixed economy, with tax revenue coming from bets made at the Shonan Bank Cycling Velodrome and, several industries located in industrial parks in the outskirts of town. Major plants are operated by [[Nissan Shatai]], [[Yokohama Rubber Company]], [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], [[Furukawa Electric]], [[Pilot (pen company)|Pilot]]  – the famous Namiki pens are produced at Hiratsuka, [[Kansai Paint]], and [[Mitsubishi Plastics]]. Nissan Shatai is the largest employer in the city, but announced plans to move a factory to [[Kanda, Fukuoka|Kanda]]. Western firms such as Moog and MacDermid Performance Solutions also have a strong presence in this city.<ref>{{cite news|title=MacDermid Performance Solutions Completes Major Expansion of Japan Facility|work=[[Yahoo!
