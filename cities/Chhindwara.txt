'''Chhindwara''' is a city in India and a [[Municipal Corporation]] in [[Chhindwara district]] in the Indian [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. The city is the administrative headquarters of [[Chhindwara District]]. Chhindwara is reachable by rail or road from adjacent cities [[Betul, Madhya Pradesh|Betul]], [[Jabalpur]] and [[Nagpur]]. The nearest airport is in Nagpur (130&nbsp;km); however there is a small airport located in the city which is not serviceable for passenger planes.

== History ==
It was believed that Chhindwara District was full of "[[Phoenix sylvestris|Chhind]]" trees (wild date palms) many years ago, and the place was called "Chhind"-"Wada" (wada means place). Another story says that due to the population of lions (called "sinh" in Hindi), it was considered equivalent to entering the lions' den to enter this district. Hence, it was called "Sinh Dwara" ({{lit|Lion Gate}}). In course of time, it became "Chhindwara".

The Gole Gunj market of the city, with its two large gateways (known today as Kamania Gate), was built by Captain Montgomery, who administrated the district as a regent of Richard Jenkins (1818–1830). The [[municipality]] of Chhindwara was founded in 1867.

==Geography==
Chhindwara is one of the largest cities in the [[Satpura range]] and the largest district in terms of area in Madhya Pradesh. It is on a plateau, surrounded by lush green fields, rivers and by dense forest with diverse flora and fauna. The town is built around the Bodri Stream, a tributary with the [[Kulbehra River]]<ref name="Russell">{{Cite book|editor=Russell, R.

=== CII at Chhindwara ===
The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) started its operation in August 2007 at Chhindwara with the opening of a secretariat at Madhuvan Colony. Initially, CII worked largely upon small agricultural conferences, "Kisan Goshthis" as the district is predominantly an agrarian economy. In September 2008 CII inaugurated first of its kind the National Center of Excellence for Skill Development catering to the need of skilled workforce for the Indian industry. Companies such as Punj Lloyd, JCB India Ltd. and Toyota Kirloskar Motors (TKM) are imparting training in trades.

Initially, [[Ambuja Cements|Ambuja Cement]] and [[L&T Infotech|L&T ECC]] division started trades of masonry and bar bending respectively but had to wind up as the trades were not very well taken by the masses. However, Ambuja Cement has recently started a training center at Amarwara and L&T ECC is constantly picking up youth from the rural areas for training at their well-established centers at Chennai and Hyderabad. As of now, the CII's National Center of Excellence for Skill Development is operating out of WCL's Campus, Parmanand Rehabilitation Center at Chakkar Road near Satpuda Club. Some 600 trainees have been trained in trades such as welding and fitting by Punj Lloyd, backhoe loader operation by JCB and TTEP (a motor mechanic course) by TKM. CII has got ambitious plans about the CoE; in near future, the center will move to its own campus at Imlikhera where it will operate out of a {{convert|10|acre|m2}} of premises with {{convert|20|acre|m2}} extra completely devoted for driving. Companies such as CAT, Cummins, Mahindra & Mahindra and GMR will start their training here. The center is under the aegis of Mr. Kamalnath, the MP from Chhindwara and the Minister for Road Transport and Highways. The future is very bright for this unique center as it is helping the cause of the Indian government skill development program.

==Tourist attractions==
{{guidebook|section|date=August 2024}}
The main tourist attractions in and around Chhindwara include:
* '''[[Deogarh Fort]]:''' This historical fort is {{convert|24|mi|km}} south of Chhindwara beyond Mohkhed. It is built on a hill which is fortified by a deep valley clothed with dense reserve forest. The fort is approachable up to its foot by motor road. Deogarh Fort was built by King Jatav of Gond. It was the capital of Gondwana dynasty until the 18th century. The architecture is somewhat similar to that of Mughal. It is believed that there was a secret underground passage connecting Devgarh to Nagpur. Here is a tank called "motitaka" and there is famous saying that the water in this tank never finishes. At present, Deogarh village is a small inhabitant's area.
*'''[[Patalkot, India|Patalkot]]''', in the hilly block 'Tamia' of Chhindwara District, has acquired great importance because of its geographical situation and scenery.{{fact|date=August 2024}} Patalkot is located at a depth of 1200–1500 feet in a valley. Because of the great depth, this place is christened as 'Patalkot' (patal means very deep, in Sanskrit). When one looks down from the top of the valley, the place looks like a horseshoe in shape. Earlier, people believed it as the entrance to 'Patal'. There is one more belief that after worshiping 'Lord Shiva' Prince [[Indrajit|Meghnath]] had gone to Patal-lok through this place only. People say that this place was ruled by kings in 18th and 19th centuries and that there was a long tunnel connecting this place to 'Pachmarhi' in Hoshangabad District. Because of the inaccessibility of this area, the tribals of this region were totally cut off from the civilized world. But, with the constant efforts being made by the government, tribals of this area started tasting the advantages of adopting civilized life.{{fact|date=August 2024}}
*''' Tamia Hills''' are around 45&nbsp;km from Chhindwara. The steep hills, dense forests, and big winding ghats have all combined to make Tamia a tourist destination.{{fact|date=August 2024}} A PWD rest house is situated on a steep hill commanding a view of the deep forests and mountainous ranges of Satpura notably Mahadeo and Chaura Pahad in the background. The government postal bungalow in Tamia is located in a hilly range at {{convert|3765|ft|m}} height above Mean Sea Level surrounded by dense forest. About 1.5&nbsp;km from this bungalow there is a cave where in the holy 'Shivling' (the deity of Lord Shiva) of 'Chota Mahadev' exists. Just beside the cave is a small water fall.{{fact|date=August 2024}}
*'''Gotmar Mela of Pandhurna:''' 98&nbsp;km from Chhindwara, in the headquarters of Pandhurna tahsil, a unique fair (mela in Hindi) by name 'Gotmar Mela' is celebrated every year on the second day to 'Bhadrapad' New Moon day on the banks of the river Jam. A long tree is erected in the middle of the river with a flag at its very top. The residents of the villages Savargaon and Pandhurna gather on either bank and start pelting stones ('got') at the persons of the opposite village who try to cross into the mid of the river and remove the flag on top of the tree trunk. The village whose resident succeeds in removing the flag is considered victorious. The whole activity happens amidst the chanting of the sacred name of 'Maa' Durgaji. Several people have been wounded in this celebration and the district administration made elaborate arrangements for the smooth conduct of this rare fair. People have been left dead or injured, so the festival has now been banned.Administration is now fail to stop the activity.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,25958698-23109,00.html |work=AFP |title=Villages' killer stoning festival banned |date=20 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827003204/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C27574%2C25958698-23109%2C00.html |archive-date=27 August 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>
* The '''Tribal Museum''' started in Chhindwara on 20 April 1954 and acquired 'State Museum' status in 1975.
