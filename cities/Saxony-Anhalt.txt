The state of Saxony-Anhalt was formed in July 1945 after [[World War II]], when the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|Soviet army administration]] in [[Allied-occupied Germany]] formed it from the former [[Free State of Prussia|Prussian]] [[Province of Saxony]] and the [[Free State of Anhalt]]. Saxony-Anhalt became part of the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] in 1949, but was dissolved in 1952 during [[Administrative divisions of East Germany|administrative reforms]] and its territory was divided into the districts of [[Halle (Bezirk)|Halle]] and [[Magdeburg (Bezirk)|Magdeburg]]. Following [[German reunification]], the state of Saxony-Anhalt was re-established in 1990 and became one of the [[New states of Germany|new states]] of the Federal Republic of Germany.

Saxony-Anhalt is renowned for its rich cultural heritage and possesses the highest concentration of [[List of World Heritage Sites in Germany|UNESCO World Heritage sites in Germany]].

==Geography==
Saxony-Anhalt is one of 16 [[States of Germany|constituent states]] of Germany. It is located in the western part of eastern Germany. By size, it is the 8th largest state in Germany and by population, it is the 11th largest.

It borders four other states: [[Brandenburg]] to the north-east, [[Saxony]] to the south-east, [[Thuringia]] to the south-west and [[Lower Saxony]] to the north-west.

In the north, the Saxony-Anhalt landscape is dominated by the [[plain|flat expanse]] of the [[North German Plain]]. The old [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] towns [[Salzwedel]], [[Gardelegen]], [[Stendal]] and [[Tangermünde]] are located in the sparsely populated [[Altmark]]. The Colbitz-Letzlingen Heath and the [[Drömling]] near [[Wolfsburg]] mark the transition between the Altmark region and the Elbe-Börde-Heath region with its fertile, sparsely wooded [[Magdeburg Börde]]. Notable towns in the Magdeburg Börde are [[Haldensleben]], [[Oschersleben (Bode)]], [[Wanzleben]], [[Schönebeck (Elbe)]], [[Aschersleben]] and the capital [[Magdeburg]], from which the [[Börde]] derives its name.

The [[Harz mountains]] are located in the south-west, comprising the [[Harz National Park]], the Harz Foreland and [[Mansfeld Land]]. The highest mountain of the Harz (and of [[Northern Germany]]) is [[Brocken]], with an elevation of 1,141 meters (3,735&nbsp;ft). In this area, one can find the towns of [[Halberstadt]], [[Wernigerode]], [[Thale]], [[Eisleben]] and [[Quedlinburg]].

The wine-growing area Saale-Unstrut and the towns of [[Zeitz]], [[Naumburg (Saale)]], [[Weißenfels]] and [[Freyburg (Unstrut)]] are located on the rivers [[Saale]] and [[Unstrut]] in the south of the state.

The metropolitan area of [[Halle (Saale)]] forms an agglomeration with [[Leipzig]] in Saxony. This area is known for its highly developed chemical industry (the ''Chemiedreieck'' – chemical triangle), with major production plants at [[Leuna]], [[Schkopau]] (''Buna-Werke'') and [[Bitterfeld]]. Finally, in the east, [[Dessau-Roßlau]] and [[Wittenberg]] are situated on the Elbe (as is the capital Magdeburg) in the Anhalt-Wittenberg region.

The capital and largest city of Saxony-Anhalt is [[Magdeburg]]. The second-largest city in the state is [[Halle (Saale)]]. From 1994 to 2003, the state was divided into three regions ({{Lang|de|[[Regierungsbezirk]]e}}), [[Dessau (region)|Dessau]], [[Halle (region)|Halle]] and [[Magdeburg (region)|Magdeburg]] and, below the regional level, 21 [[Districts of Germany|districts]] (''Landkreise''). Since 2004, however, this system has been replaced by 11 rural districts and three urban districts.<ref>[http://st.juris.de/st/LKreisGebNRG_ST_rahmen.htm District reform law] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719051202/http://st.juris.de/st/LKreisGebNRG_ST_rahmen.htm |date=19 July 2011 }} 11 November 2005 {{in lang|de}}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of Saxony-Anhalt}}
[[File:Coat of arms of Saxony-Anhalt 1947-1952.svg|thumb|upright|Coat of arms of Saxony-Anhalt between 1946 and 1952]]

Saxony-Anhalt is a federal state with a relatively short history, compared to other German federal states. It was formed in 1945 out of former [[Prussia|Prussian territories]] and mainly consists of three distinct historical regions: the area around [[Magdeburg]], the formerly independent [[Free State of Anhalt|Anhalt]] and a southern part which once was part of [[Province of Saxony|Saxony]] but had been annexed by Prussia in the 19th century. This historical origin can still be seen in the coat of arms of the federal state.

In April 1945 the [[US Army]] took control of most of the western and northern area of the future Saxony-Anhalt. The ''U.S. Group Control Council, Germany'' (a precursor of the [[Office of Military Government, United States|OMGUS]]) appointed the first non-Nazi officials in leading positions in the area. [[Erhard Hübener]], put on leave by the Nazis, was reappointed [[Landeshauptmann#Prussia|Landeshauptmann (state governor)]]. By early July the US Army withdrew from the former Prussian [[Province of Saxony]] to make way for the [[Red Army]] to take it as part of the [[Soviet occupation zone]], as agreed by the [[London Protocol (1944)|London Protocol]] in 1944.

On 9 July the Soviet [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|SVAG]] ordered the merger of the [[Free State of Anhalt]], [[Halle-Merseburg]], the [[Magdeburg (region)|governorate of Magdeburg]] (in its then borders), [[Allstedt]] (before Thuringia) and some [[Free State of Brunswick|Brunswickian]] eastern [[exclave]]s and [[Salient (geography)|salients]] ([[Calvörde]] and the eastern part of the former [[Blankenburg am Harz|Blankenburg]] district<ref>The latter, however, a salient originally not assigned as part of the Soviet zone, was unilaterally handed over by the Britons only on 22 July.</ref>) with the Province of Saxony.<ref name="dessau gedenk">[http://www.gedenkkultur-dessau-rosslau.de/1945-1949/chronik1 "1945–1949"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312064959/http://www.gedenkkultur-dessau-rosslau.de/1945-1949/chronik1 |date=12 March 2012 }}, on: [http://www.gedenkkultur-dessau-rosslau.de ''Gedenkkultur Dessau-Roßlau''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826105028/http://www.gedenkkultur-dessau-rosslau.de/ |date=26 August 2011 }}. Retrieved on 16 August 2011.</ref> The previously Saxon [[Erfurt (region)|Erfurt governorate]] had become a part of [[Thuringia]].

''Anhalt'' takes its name from [[Anhalt Castle]] near [[Harzgerode]]; the origin of the name of the castle remains unknown. Anhalt was once an independent German federal state dating back centuries.

The SVAG appointed Hübener as president of the provincial Saxon administration, a newly created function. The administration was seated in Halle an der Saale, which became the capital, also of later Saxony-Anhalt until 1952. On 3 September 1945 the new administration enacted by Soviet-inspired ordinance the mass expropriations, mostly hitting holders of large real estates, often of noble descent.

On the occasion of the first (and one and only) election in the Soviet zone, allowing parties truly to compete for seats in provincial and state parliaments, on 20 October 1946, the Province of Saxony was renamed as the Province of Saxony-Anhalt (''{{langx|de|Provinz Sachsen-Anhalt}}''), taking the prior merger into account.<ref name="dessau gedenk"/> On 3 December 1946 the members of the new provincial parliament elected Hübener the first [[minister-president]] of Saxony-Anhalt, with the votes of the [[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|CDU]] and [[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany|Liberal Democratic Party of Germany (LDPD)]]. Thus he became the only [[governor]] in the Soviet zone who was not a member of the communist [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED)]], making him an inconvenience for the Soviet forces.

After the official Allied decision to dissolve the [[Free State of Prussia]], which had remained in limbo since the [[Preußenschlag|Prussian coup of 1932]], [[Provinces of Prussia|its former provinces]], in as far as they still existed, achieved statehood; thus the province emerged into the ''State of Saxony-Anhalt'' on 6 October 1947.<ref name="dessau gedenk"/> It became part of the [[German Democratic Republic]] ([[East Germany]]) in 1949. From 1952 on the East German states were dissolved, and Saxony-Anhalt's territory was divided into the East German districts of [[Halle (Bezirk)|Halle]] and [[Magdeburg (Bezirk)|Magdeburg]], except that the territory around [[Torgau]] was assigned to [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig]]. In 1990, in the course of [[German reunification]], the districts were reintegrated as a state. The territory around Torgau did not return to the state and joined Saxony. Torgau is now the centre of the [[Nordsachsen]] district (since 2008).

In 2015 the skeletal remains of an [[Karsdorf remains|ancient inhabitant of Karsdorf]] dated from the Early Neolithic (7200 BP) were analysed; he turned out to belong to the [[Haplogroup T-M184|paternal T1a-M70 lineage]] and maternal lineage H1.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marres.education/far-forbears.htm |title=Our Far Forebears |first=E.C.W.L.

The region has historically been associated with the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] faith, but under Communist rule, church membership was strongly discouraged and much of the population disassociated itself from any religious body. Saxony-Anhalt contains many sites tied to Martin Luther's life, including [[Lutherstadt Eisleben]] and [[Lutherstadt Wittenberg]].

In 2018, the majority of citizens in Saxony-Anhalt were irreligious and more were leaving the churches than entering them<ref name="sachsen-anhalt-wahl.de">[http://www.sachsen-anhalt-wahl.de/das-land-sachsen-anhalt/religion-in-sachsen-anhalt.htm#more-15] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317152800/http://www.sachsen-anhalt-wahl.de/das-land-sachsen-anhalt/religion-in-sachsen-anhalt.htm#more-15|date=17 March 2012}}</ref> – in fact, Saxony-Anhalt is the most irreligious state in Germany. Of the Saxon-Anhaltish, 15.2% adhered to the major denominations of Christianity (11.9% were members of the [[Protestant Church in Germany]] and 3.3% were [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]]),<ref name="ekd">[https://www.ekd.de/ekd_de/ds_doc/Ber_Kirchenmitglieder_2018.pdf Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland – Kirchemitgliederzahlen Stand 31.

Originally their branch office for Germany was in Magdeburg. When World War II ended in 1945, the property in Magdeburg, then part of East Germany, was returned and the branch was reestablished. But on 30 August 1950 Communist police stormed the facilities and arrested the workers, and the Jehovah's Witnesses in the German Democratic Republic (DDR) were banned.

==Economy==
{{Update|section|reason=Outdated Data|talk=Outdated economic data needs an update|date=January 2023}}

The [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the state was 62.7 billion euros in 2018, which accounts for 1.9% of Germany's total economic output and [[List of German states by GRP|ranks 13th]] among the 16 German states. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 26,000 euros or 86% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 88% of the EU average. The GDP per capita was the second lowest of all German states.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58 |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018 |website=Eurostat}}</ref> 

By 2020, the GDP of the state dropped to 62.654 billion euros, shortly after reaching an all-time high of 64.115 billion euros in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Germany GDP: Sachsen Anhalt {{!}} Economic Indicators {{!}} CEIC |url=https://www.ceicdata.com/en/germany/esa-2010-gdp-by-region/gdp-sachsen-anhalt |access-date=2023-09-18 |website=www.ceicdata.com}}</ref>

===Development===
Saxony-Anhalt was part of the communist German Democratic Republic. After the breakdown of communism and the German reunification in 1990, the collapse of non-competitive former GDR industries temporarily caused severe economic problems. In 2000, Saxony-Anhalt had the highest unemployment rate of all German states, at 20.2%.<ref>{{cite web |author=Statistisches Landesamt Sachsen-Anhalt |url=http://www.statistik.sachsen-anhalt.de/Internet/Home/Daten_und_Fakten/1/13/132/13211/Arbeitsmarktdaten_im_Land_Sachsen_Anhalt.html |title=Statistical Office of the State of Saxony-Anhalt (2010) |publisher=Statistik.sachsen-anhalt.de |date=29 January 2014 |access-date=16 August 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819125542/http://www.statistik.sachsen-anhalt.de/Internet/Home/Daten_und_Fakten/1/13/132/13211/Arbeitsmarktdaten_im_Land_Sachsen_Anhalt.html |archive-date=19 August 2014}}</ref>

However, the process of economic transformation towards a modern [[market economy]] seems to be completed. Massive investments in modern infrastructure have taken place since 1990, and the remaining and newly created businesses are highly competitive. For example, the industry has doubled its share of international revenue from 13 percent in 1995 to 26 percent in 2008.<ref>[http://www.halle.ihk.de/webKreator/upload/temp_dokumente/1034285159/Regionalstatistik%202010.pdf Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Halle-Dessau (2010), p. 14]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref> Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has fallen considerably.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ihk-berlin.de/linkableblob/818034/.23./data/Fakten_Arbeitsmarkt-data.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.ihk-berlin.de/linkableblob/818034/.23./data/Fakten_Arbeitsmarkt-data.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |title=Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Berlin (2011), p. 2 |language=de |access-date=16 August 2014}}</ref> By 2010 the GDP of Saxony-Anhalt was almost two and a half times higher than it was in 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fdiatlas.com/area/Europe/Germany/region/Saxony-Anhalt |title=(2010) |publisher=fDi Atlas |access-date=16 August 2014 |archive-date=4 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404155856/http://www.fdiatlas.com/area/Europe/Germany/region/Saxony-Anhalt |url-status=live }}</ref>

Even though part of this recovery was brought on by the positive performance of the German economy, Saxony-Anhalt not only followed the national trend, but clearly outperformed other German states. For example, it outperformed three German states in terms of unemployment (10.8%, as of September 2011): the German capital and [[city-state]] of [[Berlin]] (12.7%), the city-state [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]] (11.3%) and [[Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]] (11%).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.ihk-berlin.de/linkableblob/818034/.28./data/Fakten_Arbeitsmarkt-data.pdf;jsessionid=DDE8292A29242A352F72A9D35E869F0F.repl1 |title=Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Berlin |page=2 |date=2011 |access-date=16 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201204441/http://m.ihk-berlin.de/linkableblob/818034/.28./data/Fakten_Arbeitsmarkt-data.pdf;jsessionid=DDE8292A29242A352F72A9D35E869F0F.repl1 |archive-date=1 February 2014}}</ref>

The unemployment began to fall under 10% in 2016, and stood at 7.1% in October 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/36651/umfrage/arbeitslosenquote-in-deutschland-nach-bundeslaendern/ |title=Arbeitslosenquote nach Bundesländern in Deutschland 2018 {{!}} Statista |website=Statista |language=de |access-date=13 November 2018 |archive-date=27 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210627171657/https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/36651/umfrage/arbeitslosenquote-in-deutschland-nach-bundeslaendern/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

*The [[chemical industry]] is quite important, with almost 25,500 employees across 214 plants in 2010.<ref name="fDi Atlas">[http://www.fdiatlas.com/area/Europe/Germany/region/Saxony-Anhalt/sectorstrengths fDi Atlas] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404155917/http://www.fdiatlas.com/area/Europe/Germany/region/Saxony-Anhalt/sectorstrengths |date=4 April 2012 }} (2010)</ref> One of the biggest chemical producing areas can be found around the city of [[Bitterfeld-Wolfen]]. Because of the chemical industry, Saxony-Anhalt attracts more [[foreign direct investment]]s than any other state in eastern Germany.
*The state is the location of numerous [[wind farm]]s producing wind-turbine energy.
*Saxony-Anhalt is also famous for its good soil. Hence, the [[food industry]] has an important role with almost 19,500 employees across 190 plants in 2010.<ref name="fDi Atlas"/> Some of the best known products are [[Baumkuchen]] from [[Salzwedel]] and [[Halloren Chocolate Factory|Halloren chocolate globes]] from Germany's oldest chocolate factory in Halle.
