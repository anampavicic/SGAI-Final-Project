== History ==
The area of Izumo was part of the ancient [[Izumo Province]] and has been inhabited since prehistoric times. In 2009, a team of archaeologists announced that they likely discovered—at the Sunabara Site in [[Taki, Shimane|Taki-chō]], Izumo—the oldest [[stone tool]]s ever found in Japan. The find totaled about 20 tools dating back an estimated 120,000 years: about 80,000 years earlier than previous estimates of when the first humans arrived in the Japanese archipelago.<ref name=PI1>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20091001a8.html The Japan Times], (October 1, 2009), "Tools may rewrite Paleolithic Japan", accessed 11-25-2009</ref> Later, this date was revised to 70,000 years before present upon the discovery of a layer of volcanic ash also dated 70,000 years before present.<ref>[https://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/003829.html Research yields younger age for oldest Japanese stone tools]</ref> A powerful ancient kingdom developed in the fertile Izumo Plain from the [[Yayoi period]], as evidenced by the area's rich mythology, ruins, large amount of excavated items, and a wide variety of ancient tombs. The Izumo area is also rich in [[Kofun period]] [[burial mound]]s. The [[Imaichi Dainenji Kofun]]  is believed to have been constructed in the 6th century with highly sophisticated construction methods for the time and with an overall length of 100 meters is the largest in the Izumo region<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hometown.infocreate.co.jp/en/chugoku/izumo/midoko-e.html |title=Hometown Homepage - Izumo Places to Visit |publisher=Hometown.infocreate.co.jp |date=2006-10-20 |access-date=2014-03-13 |archive-date=2012-03-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310111025/http://hometown.infocreate.co.jp/en/chugoku/izumo/midoko-e.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

During the [[Sengoku period]], Izumo was the stronghold of the [[Amago clan]], until their defeat by the [[Mōri clan]]. Under the [[Edo Period]] [[Tokugawa shogunate]], the area came largely under the control of [[Matsue Domain]]. Following the [[Meiji restoration]], the town of Imaichi was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Imaichi merged with eight surrounding villages to form the town of Izumo on February 11, 1941. Izumo was raised to city status less than 9 months later, on November 3, 1941.

On March 22, 2005, Izumo absorbed the city of [[Hirata, Shimane|Hirata]], and the towns of [[Koryō, Shimane|Koryō]], [[Sada, Shimane|Sada]], [[Taisha, Shimane|Taisha]] and [[Taki, Shimane|Taki]] (all from [[Hikawa District, Shimane|Hikawa District]]) to create the new and expanded city of Izumo.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

On October 1, 2011, the town of [[Hikawa, Shimane|Hikawa]] (also from Hikawa District) was also merged into the new Izumo. Hikawa District was dissolved as a result of this merger.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Government==
Izumo has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 30 members. Izumo contributes nine members to the Shimane Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the [[Shimane 2nd district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
The main industries in are agriculture and [[commercial fishing]]. Izumo is also a major tourist destination within the San'in region.

==Education==
Izumo has 36 public elementary school and 14 public junior high schools operated by the city government, and six public high schools operated by the Shimane Prefectural Board of Education. There are also two private high schools, and the prefecture operates one special education school for the handicapped.
