'''Basel-Stadt''' or '''Basel-City''' ({{langx|de|Kanton Basel-Stadt}} {{IPA|de|ˌbaːzl̩ˈʃtat||De-Basel-Stadt.ogg}}; {{langx|rm|Chantun Basilea-Citad}}; {{langx|fr|Canton de Bâle-Ville}} {{IPA-fr|bɑl.vil|}}; {{langx|it|Canton Basilea Città}}) is one of the [[Canton of Switzerland|26 cantons]] forming the [[Switzerland|Swiss Confederation]]. It is composed of three municipalities with [[Basel]] as the capital. It is traditionally considered a "[[half-canton]]", the other half being [[Basel-Landschaft]], its rural counterpart.

Basel-Stadt is one of the northernmost and lowest cantons of Switzerland, and the smallest by area. The canton lies on both sides of the [[Rhine]] and is very densely populated. The largest municipality is [[Basel]], followed by [[Riehen]] and [[Bettingen]]. The only canton sharing borders with Basel-Stadt is Basel-Landschaft to the south. To the north of Basel-Stadt are [[France]] and [[Germany]], with the tripoint being in the middle of the Rhine.

Together with Basel-Landschaft, Basel-Stadt was part of the [[Canton of Basel]], who joined the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] in 1501. Political quarrels and armed conflict led to the partition of the canton in 1833.

Basel-Stadt is Switzerland's seventh-largest economic centre<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistiken/volkswirtschaft/volkswirtschaftliche-gesamtrechnung/bruttoinlandprodukt-kanton.html|title=Gross domestic product per canton and region|first=Federal Statistical|last=Office|website=www.bfs.admin.ch}}</ref> and has the highest [[GDP per capita]] in the country, ahead of the cantons of [[Canton of Zug|Zug]] and [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]] (in 2018).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/442774/umfrage/bruttoinlandsprodukt-bip-pro-kopf-in-der-schweiz-nach-kantonen/|title=Schweiz - Bruttoinlandsprodukt pro Kopf nach Kanton 2018|website=Statista}}</ref> In terms of value, over 94% of Basel City's goods exports are in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. With production facilities located in the neighbouring Schweizerhalle, Basel accounts for 20% of Swiss exports.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.credit-suisse.com/media/mediarelease-assets/pdf/2009/03/000000021763.pdf |title=Archived copy |website=www.credit-suisse.com |access-date=11 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603054722/http://www.credit-suisse.com/media/mediarelease-assets/pdf/2009/03/000000021763.pdf |archive-date=3 June 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==History==
The canton of Basel-Stadt was created when the [[Basel (canton)|historic canton of Basel]] was divided in 1833, following political quarrels and armed conflict in the canton. Some of these were concerned with the rights of the population in the agricultural areas. They ultimately led to the separation of the [[canton of Basel-Landschaft]] from the city of Basel on 26 August 1833. Since then, there has been a movement for reunification. This movement gained momentum after 1900 when many parts of Basel-Landschaft became industrialized. The two half-cantons agreed in principle to reunite, but in 1969, and again in September 2014, the people of Basel-Landschaft voted against this proposal in favour of retaining their independence.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/abstimmungen/abstimmungen/abstimmungen-bs/kantonsfusion-scheitert-an-baselland/|title=Kantonsfusion scheitert an Baselland |date=2014-09-28|website=SRF|access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/schweiz/standard/Die-beiden-Basel-bleiben-getrennt/story/19028866|title=Die beiden Basel bleiben getrennt|date=28 September 2014|access-date=4 April 2018|via=tagesanzeiger.ch}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:MZA Chrischona4 retouched.jpg|thumb|left|View from [[St. Chrischona]], the highest location in the canton]]
The canton of Basel-Stadt is located in the north of Switzerland. Basel is located at the so-called '[[Rhine knee|knee]]' of the [[Rhine]], at the point where from the west the little [[Birsig]] joins the Rhine from the left, and where the Rhine itself switches from flowing in a westerly direction to a northerly flow. It is the [[List of Swiss cantons by elevation|second flattest canton]], with a height difference of only 277 metres between the Rhine and [[St. Chrischona]].

[[Bettingen]], [[Riehen]] and a part of Basel city lie on the east bank of the Rhine, bordered on three sides by the German state of Baden-Württemberg. The rest of the canton lies on the west bank of the Rhine.

The area of the canton is {{cvt|37|km2}}, making Basel-Stadt the smallest canton in Switzerland. It is sometimes likened to a [[city-state]].<ref>[http://www.bs.ch/dam/jcr:485ef4e3-3642-4d84-aa7d-290908e4aea1/Brochure_Welcome_BaselStadt.pdf Canton of Basel-Stadt] Welcome</ref>

Basel-Stadt borders Basel-Landschaft to the south, the only adjacent canton. To the north, it borders [[Germany]] ([[Baden-Württemberg]]) and [[France]] ([[Grand Est]]). The three countries meet in the middle of the Rhine, about 150 metres north of the [[Dreiländereck (Basel)|Dreiländereck]] monument.<ref>[[Swisstopo]] topographic maps</ref>

==Municipalities==
There are three municipalities:

==Politics==
The canton of Basel-Stadt shares its [[Basel#Politics|political structure and administration]] with the municipality of [[Basel]].

{{lang|de|Basel-Stadt}} is a [[half-canton]]. This means that the canton only sends one representative to the [[Swiss Council of States|Council of States]]. The capital of the canton {{lang|de|Basel-Stadt}} is the city of Basel. The present constitution of the canton dates from 1889. Since 1966 women were allowed to vote in Canton, as the first German speaking canton.<ref>{{Cite web |title=1966 - 2016: 50 Jahre Frauenstimmrecht im Kanton Basel-Stadt |url=http://www.frauenstimmrecht.ch/ |access-date=2022-05-16 |website=Frauenstimmrecht Basel-Stadt |language=de-DE}}</ref>

The parliament of the canton is the [[Grand Council of Basel-Stadt|Grand Council]], which has 100 members, who are elected for four years at a time. There are eight different political parties represented in the parliament; the largest party is the [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democratic Party]], with 32 seats.

The executive of the canton (''{{lang|de|Regierungsrat}}'') is made up of seven members.

The canton has a sister state status with [[Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.swissnexboston.org/about/initiatives/basel/sister-state-agreement/|title=Sister-State Agreement - swissnex Boston|website=www.swissnexboston.org|access-date=4 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222053033/https://www.swissnexboston.org/about/initiatives/basel/sister-state-agreement/|archive-date=22 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Industria Novartis.jpg|thumb|[[Novartis]] headquarters in Basel]]
The economic area of Basel is considered to be the second largest economic centre in Switzerland, after Zurich.
The chemical industry and the pharmaceutical industry are of greatest significance in the canton. There are a number of multinationals in the city of Basel, attracting workers from both cantons of Basel and the areas across the border in France and Germany. Banking and finance are important as is the service sector in general. Small and middle-sized businesses employ a significant number of people, both in the city as the two municipalities. The canton is also known for its banking sector, and for being the worldwide seat of the [[Bank for International Settlements]].

Economically, the neighbouring lands in Germany and France are not separated from the area of the canton of Basel-Stadt. Good transport links across the border, as well as supportive local governments, facilitate this link.

The fact that three nation-states come together in one spot near Basel (''{{lang|de|Dreiländereck}}'') helps attract tourists. The site is clearly identified and a popular destination for primary school classes. The carnival attracts a large number of people from across Switzerland and the neighbouring countries.

In 2014, there were 104 workers in Basel-Stadt who worked in the [[Primary sector of the economy|primary sector]] (the total for all of Switzerland is 3.3%). In the same year the [[Secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]] employed 36,441 or about 19.0% of the total workforce. Of those in the secondary sector, nearly half of the workers were involved in the production of pharmaceutical products. The [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sector]] employed 154,896 or about 80.9% of the total, which is slightly higher than 74.9% nationwide. Of those in the tertiary sector, health care, education and retail sales made up about a quarter. Some of the other major tertiary fields included job placement (5.1%), management and business consulting (4.1%), public administration (3.9%), architectural and engineering offices (3.7%) and financial services (3.5%).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pxweb.bfs.admin.ch/Selection.aspx?px_language=de&px_db=px-x-0602010000_101&px_tableid=px-x-0602010000_101\px-x-0602010000_101.px&px_type=PX |title=Arbeitsstätten und Beschäftigte nach Kanton, Wirtschaftsabteilung und Grössenklasse |year=2014 |work=STAT-TAB |publisher=Federal Statistical Office |language=de |access-date=18 April 2017 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Transport==

There is an [[Basel-Mulhouse International Airport|international airport at Basel-Mulhouse]], actually located {{cvt|4|km}} inside French territory but with customs-free access from the city. The canton is well connected by both trains and motorways to the rest of Switzerland and the neighbouring areas in France and Germany.

[[Basel SBB railway station|Basel]] is a major railway station of Switzerland, connected to [[Paris]] and [[Berlin]] with direct fast trains.

There is a port at Basel for ships on the Rhine. This port is of great significance to landlocked Switzerland, as it offers the country's only direct connection to the sea. The port benefits from good connections to both rail and road.

==Culture==
[[File:Picswiss BS-51-13.jpg|thumb|{{lang|de|Basler Fasnacht}} early-morning parade with Lanterns.]]
The [[Carnival of Basel]] (''{{lang|de|Basler Fasnacht}}'') is a major cultural event in the year. The carnival is one of the biggest in Switzerland and attracts large crowds, despite the fact that many of its central traditions are played out in the early morning starting at 4am (''{{lang|de|Morgestraich}}'') and followed by a continuous run of festivities for 72 hours.

The Autumn Fair in Basel (''{{lang|de|[[Basler Herbstmesse]]}}'') is the biggest in Switzerland.

The canton of Basel is renowned for two of its biscuits. The [[Basler Läckerli]] is a hard biscuit made of honey, almonds, candied peel and [[Kirsch]], and is enjoyed as a speciality all year round. The Basler Brunsli is made of almonds and generally enjoyed at [[Christmas]] all around Switzerland.

The Basel Messe convention center is the location of several international events. The largest are [[Art Basel]], an art show for modern and contemporary works, and [[BaselWorld]], a major watch and jewellery show.

Famous cultural ambassadors of Basel are the [[Top Secret Drum Corps]] and the [[Basel Boys Choir]].
