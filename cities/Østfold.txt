'''Østfold''' ({{IPA-no|ˈœ̂stfɔɫ|-|Ostfold.ogg}}) is a county in [[Eastern Norway]], which from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2023 was part of [[Viken (county)|Viken]]. Østfold borders [[Akershus]] and southwestern [[Sweden]] ([[Västra Götaland County]] and [[Värmland]]), while [[Buskerud]] and [[Vestfold]] are on the other side of [[Oslofjord]]. The county's administrative seat is [[Sarpsborg]]. The county controversially became part of the newly established [[Viken (county)|Viken County]] on 1 January 2020. On 1 January 2024, Østfold was re-established as an independent county, however without the former municipality of Rømskog, which was amalgamated with the Akershus municipality Aurskog-Høland in 2020.

Many manufacturing facilities are situated here, such as the world's most advanced [[biorefinery]], [[Borregaard]] in [[Sarpsborg]]. [[Fredrikstad]] has shipyards. There are granite mines in Østfold and stone from these were used by [[Gustav Vigeland]].

The county slogan is "The heartland of Scandinavia". The local dialects are characterized by their geographical proximity to Sweden.

== The name==
The old name of the [[Oslofjord]] was ''Fold''; ''Østfold'' means 'the region '''east''' of the Fold' (see also [[Vestfold]]). The name was first recorded in 1543; in the Middle Ages the name of the county was ''Borgarsysla'' 'the county/sýsla of the city Borg (now [[Sarpsborg]])'. Later, when Norway was under [[Denmark|Danish rule]], the Danish king divided the area into many baronies. These were merged into one county ([[Amt (country subdivision)|amt]]) in 1662 - and it was then named ''Smaalenenes Amt'' 'the [[Amt (administrative division)|amt]] consisting of small [[counties of Norway|len]]'. The name was changed back to ''Østfold'' in 1919.

Østfold is among the nation's oldest inhabited regions, with petroglyphs (rock drawings) and burial mounds throughout the area.

In the [[Viking Age]], the area was part of [[Vingulmark]], which in turn was part of [[Viken, Norway|Viken]] and included [[Bohuslän|Båhuslen]] (which is now the Swedish province called ''Bohuslän''). It was partly under Danish rule until the time of [[Harald I of Norway|Harald Fairhair]].

Later, when Norway was under [[Denmark|Danish rule]], the Danish king divided the area into many baronies. The barony of ''Heggen og Frøland'', consisting of the municipalities [[Askim]], [[Eidsberg]] and [[Trøgstad]], originally belonged to [[Akershus]] - but it was transferred to Østfold in 1768.

In October 2018, Norwegian archaeologists headed by the archaeologist Lars Gustavsen announced the discovery of a buried {{convert|20.|m|abbr=on}} long Gjellestad Viking ship. An ancient well-preserved Viking cemetery for more than 1000 years was discovered using ground-penetrating radar. Archaeologists also revealed at least seven other previously unknown burial mounds and the remnants of five longhouses with the help of the radar survey.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-10-15|title=Viking ship burial discovered in Norway just 50cm underground|url=http://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/15/viking-ship-burial-discovered-in-norway-just-50cm-underground|access-date=2021-02-01|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Starr|first=Michelle|title=A Rare Viking Ship Burial Was Just Discovered in Norway, Less Than 2 Feet Underground|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/jellestad-ship-viking-burial-iron-age-jelle-mound-ground-penetrating-radar-norway|access-date=2021-02-01|website=ScienceAlert|date=15 October 2018 |language=en-gb}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=McGreevy|first=Nora|title=For the First Time in a Century, Norway Will Excavate Viking Ship Burial|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/first-time-century-norway-will-excavate-viking-ship-burial-180974854/|access-date=2021-02-01|website=Smithsonian Magazine|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=miljødepartementet|first=Klima-og|date=2020-05-12|title=Vil grave fram det første vikingskipet på 100 år|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/nn/aktuelt/gjellestadskipet/id2701917/|access-date=2021-02-01|website=Regjeringa.no|language=nn-NO}}</ref>

== Geography ==

Østfold sits between the [[Oslofjord|Oslo Fjord]] and [[Sweden]]. It is dominated by flat landscape with a lot of woodland in the north and along the Swedish border, a major lake system in the central part, and densely populated lowland area along the coast, with a relatively large [[archipelago]].

[[Norway]]'s longest river, the [[Glomma]], flows through the county and out into the Oslo Fjord in [[Fredrikstad]].

== Demography ==

Most of the county's population is located in the coastal area. The cities of [[Moss, Norway|Moss]], [[Sarpsborg]], [[Fredrikstad]], and [[Halden]] are situated here, along with some relatively highly populated rural municipalities. Including these coastal cities, Østfold also has another two cities, [[Askim]] and [[Mysen]].

== Transport and infrastructure ==

Østfold is located strategically between Oslo and Sweden. The main highway [[European route E6|E6]] between Oslo and Gothenburg runs as a motorway through the county from the southern border with Sweden and the border with Akershus county. The main highway [[European route E18|E18]] between Oslo and Stockholm goes through the county from the Swedish border in a southeast-northwest direction. The railway from Oslo to Gothenburg runs roughly parallel with E6, and there is also a railway between Ski and Sarpsborg that covers the inner part. 
There is no public airport in the county. [[Moss Airport, Rygge|Moss Airport]] was one but is now closed. The main airport for Østfold is the [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen]], with a population of more than 2 million people within two hours distance.

==Health care==
Aimed at covering general medical needs of Østfold County and [Vestby Municipality] Østfold Hospital provides medical services, diagnostics, treatment and rehabilitation to the population of the area.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sykehuset Østfold |url=https://sykehuset-ostfold.no/|accessdate=31 May 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Hospitals, clinics or health stations are located in all municipalities of the county.
