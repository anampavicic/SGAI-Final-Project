==Etymology==
''Nagapattinam'' is derived from ''Nagar'' referring to people from Sri Lanka who settled here and ''pattinam'' referring to town.{{sfn|W.|2002|p=161}}{{sfn|Tamil Nadu Urban Infrastructure Financial Services Limited|2008|p=5}} It was also called ''CholakulaVallipattinam'' during the period of [[Kulottunga I]], named after one of his queens, when it was one of the important ports.<ref>{{cite book|title=Middle Chola Temples: Rajaraja I to Kulottunga I, A.D. 985-1070|author=S.

The town was originally called "Nagai" and the word ''Pattinam'' was attached during the Chola era when it emerged as an important port.{{sfn|Kulke|K.|Sakhuja|2009|pp=104–107}}

==History==
There are urn burials in and around the city from the Sangam period indicating some level of human habitation. Except the mention in Ptolemy as 'Νίγαμα Μετρόπολις,' there are no direct references to Nagapattinam during the 3rd century BCE to 3rd century CE).{{sfn|Kulke|K.|Sakhuja|2009|pp=102–104}} The neighbouring port, [[Kaveripoompattinam]] (modern day Poompuhar), was the capital of the [[Chola kingdom]] of the Sangam Age, referred to widely in Tamil scriptures such as ''[[Paṭṭiṉappālai]]''.{{sfn|Kulke|K.|Sakhuja|2009|pp=102–104}}

The [[Soundararajaperumal temple, Nagapattinam|Soundarajaperumal temple]] finds a mention in the ''[[Brahmanda Purana]]'' in the Utharkanda Gyana Yoga section.

The early works of ''Tevaram'' by the 7th-century poets [[Appar]] and [[Tirugnanasambandar]] mention the town had fortified walls, busy road building and a busy port.{{sfn|Kulke|K.|Sakhuja|2009|pp=107–108}} The inscriptions from the Kayarohanswami temple indicate the construction was initiated during the reign of the Pallava king, [[Narasimhavarman II|Narasimha Pallava II]] (691–729 CE). A Buddhist pagoda was built under Chinese influence by the Pallava king and the town was frequented by Buddhist travelers. 

In the 11th century CE, [[Chudamani Vihara]], a Buddhist monastery, was built by the Sailendra king of [[Srivijaya]] Sri Mara Vijayattungavarman with the patronage of [[Rajaraja Chola I|Raja Raja Chola]].<ref name=srivijaya1/>{{sfn|Kulke|K.|Sakhuja|2009|p=67}} It was named ''Chudamani'' or ''Chulamani'' Vihara after king Sri Mara's father<ref name=srivijaya2/> As per the small Leyden grant this Vihara was called Rajaraja-perumpalli during the time of [[Kulottunga I]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Middle Chola Temples: Rajaraja I to Kulottunga I, A.D. 985-1070|author=S.

In the early 16th century the Portuguese made commercial contacts with the town and established a commercial centre in 1554 CE. The Portuguese also conducted missionary enterprise here.{{sfn|W.|2002|p=139}} In 1658, the Dutch made an agreement with King Vijaya Nayakkar of Thanjavur on 5 January 1662, by which ten villages were transferred from the Portuguese to the Dutch – Nagapattinam Port, Puthur, Muttam, Poruvalancheri, Anthanappettai, Karureppankadu, AzhingiMangalam, Sangamangalam, Thiruthinamangalam, Manjakollai, Nariyankudi. Ten Christian churches and a hospital were built by the Dutch. They released [[Pagoda (coin)|Pagoda coins]] with the name Nagapattinam engraved in Tamil. As per agreement between the first Maratha King, [[Vyankoji Bhosale|Ekoji Raje]] of [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom|Thanjavur]], and the Dutch, Naagapattinam and surrounding villages were handed over to the Dutch on 30 December 1676. In 1690, the capital of [[Dutch Coromandel]] changed from [[Pulicat]] to Nagapattinam.{{sfn|W.|2002|p=139}}

This town fell into the hands of the British in 1781 after the two naval battles between British and French fleets were fought off the coast of Negapatam, as it was then known: the [[Battle of Negapatam (1758)|first in 1758]] as part of the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[Battle of Negapatam (1782)|second in 1782]] as part of the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]]. The town was [[Siege of Negapatam|taken by the British]] from the Dutch in 1781 (who had been [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War|formally brought into the war]] in 1780).{{sfn|W.|2002|p=136}} When the Dutch and British [[Treaty of Paris (1784)|reached a peace agreement in 1784]], Nagapattinam was formally ceded to the British. 277 villages, with Nagore as the headquarters, were handed over to the [[East India Company]].{{cn|date=November 2022}}

From 1799 to 1845 CE, Nagapttinam was the headquarters of Tanjore district.{{sfn|W.|2002|p=161}} Nagapattinam and Nagore were incorporated as a single municipality in 1866 CE.{{sfn|W.|2002|p=161}} The town remained one of the chief ports to the [[Madras Presidency]]. The port suffered decline after the inclusion of [[Tranquebar]] and [[Tuticorin]] ports. After India's independence, Sirkazhi continued to be a part of [[Thanjavur district]] until 1991, and later became part of the newly created Nagapattinam district. Nagapattinam was severely affected by the [[tsunami]] which followed the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]].
