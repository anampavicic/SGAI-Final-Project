'''Nilai''' is a city located in [[Seremban District]], [[Negeri Sembilan]], [[Malaysia]], located close to the border with [[Selangor]]. It is the northern suburb within the Seremban [[metropolitan area]], as well as part of the [[Greater Kuala Lumpur|Greater Kuala Lumpur metropolitan area]]. 

Due to its proximity to the [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]], it is a rapidly growing city. Nilai is almost halfway between the state capital [[Seremban]] and [[Kajang]], [[Selangor]], and lies on the railway linking these two cities. It is also the southern terminus of [[MSC Malaysia]] and the northern anchor of the [[Malaysia Vision Valley]] corridor.

Development projects can be seen as one drive around Nilai. Some of Malaysia's most well-known [[college]]s and two universities are located in Nilai: [[Nilai University]], [[INTI International University]], [[Manipal International University]], [[Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia]] and Islamic University College of Malaysia. As a result, the town is occupied by students from all over the world. 

Nilai has become a popular shopping town with the establishment of several major shopping malls such as Nilai 3 Wholesale Centre, Nilai Square, [[AEON (company)|AEON Mall]], [[Mydin]], [[Giant Hypermarket]], [[Lotus's]] and [[Econsave]]. MesaMall is the newest addition, having been opened in 2017.

==Etymology==
The word ''Nilai'' means ''value'' in [[Malay language|Malay]]. During British colonial rule it was known as '''Sepang Road'''.<ref>{{cite web |title=1929 F.M.S.

==History==

===Founding===

Nilai has its own unique origin and history. Historically, Nilai was under ''luak'' [[Sungai Ujong]] administered by waris di Darat or waris di Air. Under Dato’ Johan from waris di Darat three Dato’ Lingkungan controls the 3 ''corak suku'' Batu Hampar concentrated in a few villages. Other lines including those from Bentan that are not based on ''suku'', but are based on the village where they live. As a Lembaga waris Perut Hulu, Waris Telaga Undang Dato’ Johan is not a ''titian balai'' because Dato’ Andika is more senior. However, the power endowed by Dato’ Kelana Putera to collect tax until the year 1894 shows that the Dato’ Johan position concerning ''balai'' Undang is important.

The third Dato’ Johan, Dato’ Maamor is the Dato’ Kelana Putra, the 8th Undang Luak Sungai Ujong. Even while being appointed as Pesaka Dato' Kelana Putera, Dato’ Maamor is still a child. At that time, Pesaka Dato' Kelana Putera position is left vacant since 1887 when Dato' Mohd Yusof, the Undang Luak Sungai Ujong is relieved from duty. Because waris Perut Hulu does not have a son to hold the ''pesaka'', the ''anak-anak buah'' unanimously appointed Dato’ Maamor who was still a child hold the pesaka Dato' Johan and then titled Dato’ Kelana.
 
Dato’ Johan's jurisdiction also covers Lenggeng Mukim which includes Mendum Village, Lenggeng Village, Sungai Jai Village, Hulu Beranang Village and Dacing Village. All these villages have their own ''ketua adat'' called ‘Tua Waris’. There are also ''suku'' of Minangkabau people concentrated on other ''luak'' in [[Negeri Sembilan]] before settling in Lenggeng Village. To ensure their welfare in ''Luak'' Sungai Ujong, all ''suku'' was given ‘Tua Waris’ to be their representative in matters relating to tradition and administration in Balai Undang Luak.<ref>http://www.mpn.gov.my/en/latar-belakang-nilai</ref>

==Education==
[[File:Nilai University.JPG|thumb|[[Nilai University]]]]

The state government's initiative to turn Negeri Sembilan into an educational hub {{citation needed|date=February 2014}} has also borne fruit as several foreign and local institutions of higher education have agreed to set up operations here.

Among them are Britain's [[Epsom College]] which has acquired land in Bandar Enstek to set up its first institute outside England, [http://www.epsomcollege.edu.my/ Epsom College in Malaysia] and the [[City University College of Science and Technology]] which signed an agreement to acquire a 40 ha parcel of land here recently. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Another offshore campus is [[Manipal International University]].

The state would also benefit from the construction of the RM1.2B Education Ministry complex which would, among others, house the Aminuddin Baki Institute, [[Institut Pendidikan Guru Kampus Pendidikan Teknik]], English Language Institute, [[Tunku Kurshiah College]] and Nilai Polytechnic as well as the [[International Islamic University Malaysia]]’s medical faculty and the International University College of Nursing.

Several institutions of higher learning that have been built in the area include [[Nilai University]], [[INTI International University]] and [[Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia]].
