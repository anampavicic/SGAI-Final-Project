== Etymology ==
The earliest record of the modern name 'Daejeon' is in the 1481 geography book, [[Donggukyeojiseungram]]. 'Daejeon' (대전 大田) is a Hanja translation of the native placeword for the area, 'Hanbat' (한밭), meaning {{'}}''Great fields''{{'}}. {{'}}''Hanbat''{{'}}, is a compound word that adds 'Han' (한/often transcribed in Hanja as 韓, as in ''Korea)'' ,that means Great or big, and the word 'Bat' (밭), meaning field, leading to Big/Great Field(s).<ref>{{Cite web |last=기자 |first=이호영 |date=2017-03-01 |title=[우리고장 대전(大田) 이야기] 대전 역사가 고작 100년? 조선 초기에도 '한밭'으로 불려 |url=https://www.goodmorningcc.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=58078#:~:text=%EB%8C%80%EC%A0%84,%20%EB%AA%85%EC%B9%AD%EC%9D%98%20%EC%9C%A0%EB%9E%98&text=%EC%88%9C%EC%9A%B0%EB%A6%AC%EB%A7%90%EB%A1%9C%20'%ED%95%9C'%EC%9D%80,(%E5%A4%A7%E7%94%B0)%EC%9D%B4%EB%9D%BC%20%EB%B6%80%EB%A5%B4%EA%B2%8C%20%EB%90%98%EC%97%88%EB%8B%A4. |access-date=2024-10-27 |website=굿모닝충청 |language=ko}}</ref>''The 'Han' (한) translated into 'Dae' (大) - both meaning big, and 'Bat' (밭)  translated to 'Jeon' (田), both meaning fields.'' 

The name Hanbat is still in use as a road name for Hanbat-daero (한밭대로), or ''Hanbat road'', a road of 12.7 kilometers connecting Daejeon's [[Yuseong District|Yuseong district]] to [[Dong District, Daejeon|Dong-gu]].[http://www.daejeon.go.kr/cmm/Download.do?filePath=FileUpload%2FBEF%2Fdj2009%2Fincomming%2Fgongbo%2FAKK0A0A0insertdb_jsp%2F2%EA%B0%9C%EC%9D%B4%EC%83%81_%EC%9E%90%EC%B9%98%EA%B5%AC%EC%97%90_%EA%B1%B8%EC%B2%98_%EC%9E%88%EB%8A%94_%EB%8F%84%EB%A1%9C%EA%B5%AC%EA%B0%84_%EB%93%B1%EC%9D%98%EA%B2%B0%EC%A0%95%28%EA%B3%A0%EC%8B%9C_%EC%A0%9C2009-177%ED%98%B8%29.hwp&fileName=2%EA%B0%9C%EC%9D%B4%EC%83%81+%EC%9E%90%EC%B9%98%EA%B5%AC%EC%97%90+%EA%B1%B8%EC%B2%98+%EC%9E%88%EB%8A%94+%EB%8F%84%EB%A1%9C%EA%B5%AC%EA%B0%84+%EB%93%B1%EC%9D%98%EA%B2%B0%EC%A0%95%28%EA%B3%A0%EC%8B%9C+%EC%A0%9C2009-177%ED%98%B8%29.hwp]

==History==

=== Ancient history to the Later Three Kingdoms Era{{efn|~ year 936, encompassing ancient history, the Proto-Three Kingdoms Era, Three Kingdoms Era, Northern and Southern States period (also Unified Silla period), Later Three Kingdoms Era.}}===
It is unclear exactly when humans first inhabited the Daejeon area. However, the Paleolithic site of ''Seokjang-ri'' in nearby [[Gongju]], Chungcheongnam-do, and the ''Yongho-dong'' site{{efn|The Yongho-dong site dates back 100,000 years, corresponding to the Middle Paleolithic period. Stone tools, known as ganseokgi, have been excavated from this archaeological site.}} in [[Daedeok District]], Daejeon, suggest that people lived here from around that time. From the [[Bronze Age]], artifacts<ref>[https://www.museum.go.kr/site/main/relic/directorytreasure/view?relicId=1991 '''Nonggyeongmun Bronze Artifact''' preserved at the National Museum of Korea.]</ref> such as bronze items, dwelling sites, and pottery have been excavated, providing concrete evidence of sustained human habitation.

During the [[Proto–Three Kingdoms period|Proto–Three Kingdoms Period]], the area was part of ''Mahan'', one of the Three Han states. It is believed to have been home to ''Sinheunguk'' (臣釁國), one of the small states that made up Mahan. However, some theories place Sinheunguk in [[Seosan|Seosan City]] or [[Yesan County]] in [[South Chungcheong Province]], so its exact location is uncertain. Proponents of the Daejeon theory speculate that "Sinheung" is related to Jinhyeon-hyeon,{{efn|Jinhyeon-hyeon evolved into Jinryeong-hyeon, which later became Jinjam-hyeon, ultimately leading to the origin of the current place name Jinjam-dong.}} which will be discussed later and eventually connects to the place name Jinjam-dong.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0033601 | script-title=ko:신흔국 (臣釁國) }}</ref> Meanwhile, the area around the now Yuseong District is thought to have been the site of Naebiri-guk (內卑離國) of Mahan. This is because the Three Kingdoms-era place name for Yuseong District, Nosaji, is also recorded as Naesaji (內斯只), and both names share the element "Nae" (內).{{efn|The term Naebiri (內卑離) incorporates the suffix biri (卑離, *pɛrɛ), which appears repeatedly in the names of small states during the Samhan period. This recurring usage suggests that biri functioned as a toponymic suffix, similar to buri (夫里) found in Baekje place names and beol (伐/火, *pɔr) used in Silla place names.

The Sino-Korean character ji (只) carried the phonetic value 'ge' (*kɛ) in the Baekje language, signifying "castle." Additionally, sa (斯), also recorded as jil (叱), is associated with the Middle Korean genitive particle 's.' Consequently, Naesaji (內斯只) can be analyzed as a combination of 'nae' (內) meaning "inner," the genitive particle, and 'seong' (城) meaning "castle," thus translating to "inner castle." This analysis indicates that the central element in both place names is 'nae' (內). During that period, the pronunciation was likely close to 'nu' or 'no.'

Despite the similarities, some scholars have argued that biri (卑離) and ji (只) could not be used interchangeably as toponymic suffixes because their meanings differed. However, evidence from the Mahan state Byeokbiriguk, which also utilized the suffix 'biri,' supports the interchangeable usage. During the Three Kingdoms period, Byeokbiriguk was renamed Byeokgol (辟骨), meaning "castle," paralleling how 'ji' (只) was used. This parallel suggests that associating Naebirikuk and Naesaji is plausible.

Furthermore, the Old Chinese pronunciation of nae (內) ended with /*s/, which implies that the phonetic value *sɛ may have been omitted in writing during the Proto-Samhan period. This omission provides additional support for linking Naebirikuk with Naesaji, as the core element 'nae' (內) remains consistent despite the phonetic changes.}}<ref>{{cite web | url=https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0012460 | script-title=ko:내비리국 (內卑離國) }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=김 |first=정학 |title=내비리국 (內卑離國) |encyclopedia=한국민족문화대백과사전 [Encyclopedia of Korean Culture] |url=https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0012460 |access-date=2024-10-27 |publisher=Academy of Korean Studies |language=ko}}</ref>

In the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms Period]], the area became part of [[Baekje]]'s territory and was known as Usul-gun (雨述郡),centered around Eumnae-dong in Daedeok District and including Hoedeok-dong. ''Also on Usul-gun,in the city exists the remains of Bakjae's mountain fortress Usul-fortress ({{Korean|hangul=우술성|labels=no}})''<ref>{{cite web | url=https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0039994 | script-title=ko:우술성 (雨述城) }}</ref>'', which was declared a city-designated monument in 1989''. This name is a transcription of the native Korean place name "Bisul" or "Bisuri," where they took the meaning "rain" from the character 雨 and the sound "sul" from 述.{{efn|Fortunately, the phonetic value is straightforward, making it a word that can be easily inferred. However, it is difficult to confirm whether it was "'''sul'''" or "'''suri'''" due to the lack of established theories regarding the multi-syllabic tendencies of ancient Korean. Nevertheless, depending on the speaker's dialect, it is possible that both forms were used.}} At Gyejoksan Mountain in Jang-dong, Daedeok District, there is a legend that "when the mountain cries during severe drought, rain comes," leading to the place name "beak-dal-san" or "beakdal" mountain,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cctoday.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=2162792 | script-title=ko:'산이 울면 비가 온다'… 명당 품은 대전 계족산 | date=27 May 2022 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.joongdo.co.kr/web/view.php?key=20201117010006360 | script-title=ko:대전 대덕구, 공정·생태관광 특화 프로그램 운영 | date=17 November 2020 }}</ref> and "Bisuri," (비수리) meaning "rainy peak."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.daejeon.go.kr/par/ParContentsHtmlView.do?menuSeq=833 | script-title=ko:공원관리사업소 }}</ref> This legend is also recorded in early Joseon-era texts like the ''[[Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty|Geographical Appendix to the Annals of King Sejong]]''{{efn|懷德縣: 本百濟 雨述郡, 新羅改爲比豐郡, 高麗改爲懷德縣。 顯宗戊午, 屬公州任內。 明宗二年壬辰, 始置監務, 本朝因之。 太宗十三年癸巳, 例改爲縣監。 鷄足山。 【縣人以爲鎭】 四境, 東距淸州十四里, 西距公州七里, 南距珍山二十二里, 北距文義二十四里。 戶三百, 口一千二百六十六。 軍丁, 侍衛軍七、守護軍四、船軍一百四十九。 土姓四, 黃、任、李、房; 亡姓一, 郭。 貞民驛續姓二, 裵、金。 厥土肥塉相半, 墾田二千六百八十八結。 【水田五分之二】 土宜五穀, 木瓜。 土貢, 眞茸、鳥足茸、漆、雜羽、黃蠟、棗、狐皮、狸皮、山獺皮、芝草、紙。 藥材, 五倍子、土産石鐵。 【産縣北二十里稷洞, 下品。】 鷄足山石城。 【在縣東十里, 四面險阻, 周回三百七十四步二尺。 內有泉一, 冬夏不渴。 鄕人云: "天旱, 此山鳴則必雨。"】 驛一, 貞民。 【俗訛田民】 利遠津。 【俗號荊角津, 有渡船。】 烽火一處, 雞足山。 【東準沃川、環山, 北準文義、所山。】 越境處, 儒城 東村 郞山里, 越入縣南面。https://sillok.history.go.kr/id/kda_40005003_010{{Bare URL inline|date=October 2024}}}} and the ''Sindonggukyeojiseungram'' (신증동국여지승람; 新增東國輿地勝覽), the version of [[Donggukyeojiseungram]], updated in 1530.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://db.itkc.or.kr/dir/item?itemId=BT#/dir/node?dataId=ITKC_BT_B001A_0190_010_0040 | script-title=ko:한국고전종합Db }}</ref>

Among these, Jinhyeon-hyeon was the only one not under Usul-gun but belonged to Hwangdeungyasangun (黃等也山郡), centered around Yeonsan-myeon in Nonsan City, Chungcheongnam-do. Based on the Five Divisions established during King Seong(성왕;year 504 ~557 july)'s reign(523 may~ 554 july), the area around Gongju City was the Northern Division, and the area around Nonsan City was the center of the Eastern Division, so it likely belonged to one of these two. Considering that the Daejeon area later generally moved in conjunction with Gongju, the dominant theory is that it belonged to the Northern parts of regional classification.{{efn|On the other hand, since Jinhyeon-hyeon was under the separate jurisdiction of Hwangdeungyasangun, it is highly probable that only this prefecture belonged to the Eastern Division.}}<ref>{{cite web | url=https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0029457 | script-title=ko:성왕 (聖王) }}</ref>

During this period, the area was one of the main frontlines among Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla, resulting in many mountain fortress ruins in Daejeon, leading to an oral tradition that the name of Sikjang Mountain originated from the Baekje army storing provisions on the mountain.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.joongdo.co.kr/web/view.php?key=20240922010005524 | title=&#91;오늘과내일&#93; 대전 식장산 효행 설화와 중국 제남의 효당산 | date=22 September 2024 }}</ref> There are also numerous fortifications that are closer to small forts than large mountain fortresses.<ref>{{Citation |title=대전광역시의 성 목록 |date=2023-09-25 |work=위키백과, 우리 모두의 백과사전 |url=https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EB%8C%80%EC%A0%84%EA%B4%91%EC%97%AD%EC%8B%9C%EC%9D%98_%EC%84%B1_%EB%AA%A9%EB%A1%9D |access-date=2024-10-27 |language=ko}}</ref> Notably, after Baekje's King Gaero had Wiryeseong captured by Goguryeo's King Jangsu, Baekje faced a critical crisis due to continued southward advances by Goguryeo.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0001616 | script-title=ko:개로왕 (蓋鹵王) }}</ref> The Goguryeo army reached as far as the Daejeon area, creating an unprecedented situation where Baekje's Ungjin Fortress was pressured from both the northeast (Sejong) and southeast (Daejeon). Relics left by the Goguryeo army from this time can be found in Wolpyeong-dong in Seo District, Daejeon, as well as in Bugaang-myeon, Saerom-dong, and Naseong-dong in Sejong.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0041093 | script-title=ko:월평동산성 (月坪洞山城) }}</ref>

It was not until the reign of King Dongseong that Baekje, allied with Silla, succeeded in driving out the Goguryeo forces from the Daejeon area. Baekje recovered the entirety of Sejong, most of Cheongju, and most of Daejeon. However, they had to tolerate Silla's occupation of the entire Goesan area—which was originally part of Hanseong Baekje's territory—as well as the northern half of now Daedeok District and the southwestern part of Cheongju. Goesan was recovered from Silla during the reign of King Uija of Baekje, but the Sintanjin area and the southwestern part of Cheongju were never regained until Baekje fell. Therefore, the northern region of Daedeok District has deep historical connections not only with Baekje but also with Silla.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0016593 | script-title=ko:동성왕 (東城王) }}</ref>

During the wars for the unification of the Three Kingdoms in 660, there is a record that the Silla army stationed at Nosurisan (怒受利山) during the [[Battle of Hwangsanbeol]],{{efn|"On July 10 of this year, Su Dingfang of Tang led naval forces and set up camp at Mijajin (尾資津). King Chun-chu of Silla led his troops and stationed at Nosurisan (怒受利山). After jointly attacking Baekje for three days, they captured our royal fortress. On the 13th of the same month, they broke through the royal fortress for the first time. Nosurisan is the eastern border of Baekje."

— From the Nihon Shoki, article dated September 5, the 6th year of Empress Saimei (660 AD), report by Baekje monk Gakjong.}} which broke out on July 9. Given the phonetic similarity to Nosaji-hyeon located in Yuseong District, it is considered to be the same place. As the Daejeon area was a border region adjacent to Hwangdeungyasangun ([[Nonsan]]), a fierce battleground, it would have been suitable for the Silla army to set up camp.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0065183 | script-title=ko:황산벌전투 (黃山伐戰鬪) }}</ref>

After the fall of Baekje, the area became the backdrop for the Baekje Revival Movement. The Ongsanseong (甕山城), where the revival forces blocked the Silla army's path and fought around August 661, is presumed to be Gyejoksanseong Fortress on Gyejoksan Mountain in Jang-dong, Daedeok District. After a three-day siege, Ongsanseong fell on September 27.{{efn|Although they were urged to surrender, the unnamed castle lord refused, saying he would rather die fighting. Given the severe plundering by the Tang army led by Su Dingfang after Baekje's fall, it's understandable that the resentment and hostility among the displaced Baekje people were extreme. After the fortress fell, the castle lord was executed, but the soldiers were all released.}} Subsequently, Usul-gun was attacked by Kim Pumil, the governor of Sangju, and over 1,000 people were executed. According to records, Jo Bok (助服), the last military commander of Usul-gun and a second-rank Dalsol, surrendered to Silla along with a third-rank Eunsol named Paga (波伽) and their followers.{{efn|Typically, a fourth-rank Deoksol was appointed as a military commander, but since a second-rank Dalsol was stationed in Usul-gun, it can be inferred that Baekje considered Usul-gun extremely important as a strategic point.}} Later, in August 662, remnants of the revival forces gathered and fortified themselves at Naesajiseong (內斯只城),presumed to be the fortress located in the aforementioned Nosaji-hyeon (奴斯只縣) which corresponds to the now Yuseong District area ,and resisted, prompting the dispatch of 19 generals, including Kim Heumsun, to defeat them.<ref>{{Citation |last=성 |first=주탁 |title=백제 부흥운동 (百濟 復興運動) |encyclopedia=한국민족문화대백과사전 [Encyclopedia of Korean Culture] |url=https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0022364 |access-date=2024-10-27 |publisher=Academy of Korean Studies |language=ko}}</ref>

In the [[Unified Silla]] period, based on Silla's ''nine provinces and five secondary capitals'' policy, the area belonged to Ungcheonju (熊川州). Later, due to King Gyeongdeok's Sinicization policy in 757, Usul-gun was renamed Bipung-gun (比豊郡),{{efn|This is a different way of transcribing the previously mentioned "Bisul/Bisuri" compared to Baekje's Usul (雨述). Whereas Usul used the meaning "rain" (雨) for "bi" and the sound "sul" (述) for "sul/suri", Bipung (比豊) likely used the sound "bi" (比) for "bi" and the meaning "sul/suri" (豊) for "sul/suri", resulting in Bipung (比豊).}} Nosaji-hyeon became Yuseong-hyeon (儒城縣),{{efn|As is well known, this is the origin of today's Yuseong District. It is one of the oldest place names in the now Daejeon area. The next oldest is Hoedeok, established during the Goryeo Dynasty. For reference, the estimated reconstructed pronunciation of the aforementioned Nosaji (奴斯只) is ''nɔsɛkɛ'', which can be analyzed as ''nɔ-sɛ-kɛ''. Here, ''kɛ'' means "castle" in the Baekje language, corresponding to the "seong" (城) in Yuseong. Additionally, the character 儒 (yu) had an Old Chinese pronunciation close to 'no', corresponding to the 'no' (奴) in Nosaji. Therefore, the place name Yuseong (儒城) was created by appropriately transcribing and translating the original native name Nosaji (奴斯只). https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0041542{{Bare URL inline|date=October 2024}}}}{{efn|Alternatively, ''nɔsɛ'' can be considered a single word. Linguist Yoon Hee-soo reconstructed the ancient Korean word ''nɔsɛ'' meaning "generosity" or "compassion," based on the fact that Nosahwa-hyeon (奴斯火縣), a place name from the Three Kingdoms period, was renamed Jain-hyeon (慈仁縣) during King Gyeongdeok's reign. If the Nosa (奴斯) in Nosaji-hyeon has the same meaning, then the character 儒 (yu) in Yuseong-hyeon (儒城), which also conveys the meaning of "benevolence," was chosen considering both the pronunciation and the meaning of the original native place name.

Jinryeong-hyeon still belonged separately to Hwangsan-gun (黃山郡), the renamed Hwangdeungyasangun. Ungcheonju was also renamed Ungju (熊州).<ref>{{cite web | url=https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0040561 | script-title=ko:웅천주 (熊川州) }}</ref>

During the Later Three Kingdoms period in the early 900s, the area came under the territory of Later Baekje. Compared to the original Baekje, Later Baekje's domain extended much further east beyond Daejeon, deeply into Gyeongsang-do, and had also reclaimed the northern part of Daedeok District, which had previously been occupied by Silla. Therefore, the area of now Daejeon Metropolitan City belonged to Later Baekje until its collapse in 936.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0065738 | script-title=ko:후백제 (後百濟) }}</ref>

=== Goryeo Dynasty ===
Entering the [[Goryeo]] period, Bipung-gun (比豊郡) was renamed Hoedeok-hyeon (懷德縣), Jeokjo-hyeon (赤鳥縣) became Deokjin-hyeon (德津縣), and Jinryeong-hyeon (鎭嶺縣) was changed to Jinjam-hyeon (鎭岑縣), while Yuseong-hyeon remained unchanged. According to the ten provinces established during King Seongjong's reign, the Daejeon area belonged to Hanam-do. All four prefectures were subordinate to Gongju-mok (公州牧), which had been elevated to one of the twelve administrative districts known as "mok."<ref name="monthly.chosun.com">{{Cite web |title=대전은 어떤 도시인가 |url=https://monthly.chosun.com/client/news/viw.asp?ctcd=&nNewsNumb=200904100081 |website=monthly.chosun.com |language=Ko}}</ref>

Later, during King Hyeonjong's reign, the implementation of the Five Provinces and Two Frontier Regions system placed the four prefectures under Yanggwang-do. Gongju-mok was downgraded back to simply Gongju, but the four prefectures remained its subordinate counties.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0063417 | script-title=ko:현종 (顯宗) }}</ref>

Subsequently, during King Myeongjong's reign, Hoedeok-hyeon and Jinjam-hyeon were promoted to "ju-hyeon" (main counties), and officials known as "Gamwu" (監務){{efn|Later renamed to Hyeongam (縣監), this official was lower in rank than the Hyeongryeong (縣令), who was also dispatched to a county/prefecture (hyeon).}} were dispatched, initiating independent administration. This autonomy continued into the Joseon Dynasty, where they remained separate districts. However, Yuseong-hyeon and Deokjin-hyeon did not gain independence and continued as subordinate counties of Gongju.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0018365 | script-title=ko:명종 (明宗) }}</ref>

Meanwhile, there were special administrative districts called "hyang," "bugok," and "so." Among these, the most famous was Myeonghakso (鳴鶴所), known as the site of the Mang Yi and Mang Soi Rebellion. This area is believed to have been located in what is now Tanbang-dong in Seo-gu.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ohmynews.com/NWS_Web/View/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0002537187&CMPT_CD=P0010&utm_source=naver&utm_medium=newsearch&utm_campaign=naver_news | script-title=ko:주변이 소란스러워 마음이 흔들릴 때, 여기에 가보시라 | date=17 May 2019 }}</ref>

=== Joseon Dynasty ===
During the [[Joseon]] period, Hoedeok-hyeon and Jinjam-hyeon were each elevated to Hoedeok-gun and Jinjam-gun, respectively. The area that is now the central part of Daejeon remained a small rural village within Gongju, which had been re-elevated to Gongju-mok during the reign of King Chung-hye of Goryeo. Notable figures like Song Si-yeol of the Eunjin Song clan lived in this vicinity, and the place name Songchon-dong, related to them, still exists as one of Daejeon's districts. Additionally, the Hoedeok Hwang clan established their base in the Hoedeok-hyeon area. Meanwhile, the name "Daejeon" (大田), which is the [[Hanja]] transcription of the native term "Hanbat" (한밭) for ''Great Fields'', first appeared in records in the early Joseon period,in ''[[Donggukyeojiseungram]],'' and continues to be used today.<ref name="monthly.chosun.com"/>

Until 1906, the current central area of Daejeon was part of Gongju, not Hoedeok or Jinjam, before it was incorporated into Hoedeok-gun. Of course, that elongated territory of Gongju wasn't Gongju land in the narrow sense; rather, as the concept of subordinate prefectures (sokhyeon) like Yuseong-hyeon and Deokjin-hyeon disappeared and were absorbed into Gongju itself, the territory expanded accordingly.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web | url=https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0066977 | script-title=ko:대덕구(대전광역시) (大德區(大田廣域市)) }}</ref>

However, the now Yuseong area remained part of Gongju until it was transferred during the establishment of Daejeon-gun in 1914. With Yuseong joining Daejeon-gun, the region roughly restored the combined territory of the central area and its subordinate prefectures from the times of Usul-gun and Bipung-gun.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

What transformed the history of Daejeon was the finalization of the Gyeongbu Line railway route in 1900. After Daejeon Station was established in Daejeon-ri, Sannae-myeon, Gongju County, in 1904, population influx began and urbanization took off. In 1906, when Sannae-myeon was incorporated into Hoedeok County, the Hoedeok County Office also moved from its original location in Hoedeok town to the urban area of Daejeon.<ref name="encykorea.aks.ac.kr"/>

=== Japanese Occupation ===
In 1914, during the major reorganization of administrative districts by the Japanese Governor-General of Korea, the existing Hoedeok County and Jinjam County, along with Yuseong-myeon (Yuseong Township) of Gongju County, were merged to form Daejeon County (大田郡). Had the name Hoedeok County been retained, the city might be called "Hoedeok Metropolitan City" today. Instead, the name "Daejeon," which was simply the name of the village where the train station was located, was adopted as the new county name, replacing the traditional name Hoedeok.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

=== Modern day ===
In 1963, Daejeon City expanded its territory by incorporating the entire Yucheon-myeon of Daedeok-gun, and parts of Sannae and Hoedeok-myeon. From this point, Sannae-myeon of Daedeok-gun became an actual exclave.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

In 1973, Buk-myeon and Yuseong-myeon of Daedeok-gun were each elevated to Sintanjin-eup and Yuseong-eup, respectively. In 1977, the ward system (gu-je) was implemented in Daejeon City, establishing two wards: Jung-gu and Dong-gu. In 1983, Daejeon City further expanded by incorporating the entire areas of Yuseong-eup and Hoedeok-myeon of Daedeok-gun, and parts of Tan-dong, Gujeok, Jinjam, and Giseong-myeon. At this time, Daedeok-gun was split into two separate parts. This situation continued until 1989, when Daedeok-gun was abolished and Daejeon was elevated to a Directly Governed City. Just before this elevation in 1988, Seo-gu was separated from Jung-gu. In 1989, Daedeok-gun was abolished and merged into Daejeon City, and the integrated Daejeon City of Chungcheongnam-do was elevated to Daejeon Directly Governed City. Simultaneously, Yuseong District was separated from Seo-gu, and Daedeok District from Dong-gu, completing the current system of five districts.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>
[[File:1993 Daejeon Expo Mascot.jpg|thumb|Kumdori;꿈돌이, or ''the little alien,'' mascot of the local 1993 expo.]]
In 1993, the city hosted the 1993 Daejeon Expo, which increased its national profile. The yellow alien mascot "Kumdori" appeared in various products such as plush toys and animations, becoming one of Daejeon's mascots. After the Expo ended, the facilities and site were utilized to open the Expo Science Park, but some exhibition halls are now almost closed. Although it had the smallest population among the five Directly Governed Cities, it surpassed Gwangju Metropolitan City in population in 1995. In the same year, it was renamed to the current Daejeon Metropolitan City.

In the late 1980s, Daejeon was elevated to the status of [[Special cities of South Korea|Special City]] (''Jikhalsi''), thus became a separate administrative region from South Chungcheong Province. In 1995, all South Korean Special Cities were again renamed as [[Metropolitan cities of South Korea|Metropolitan Cities]], which is reflected in the current official name of Daejeon, Daejeon Metropolitan City ({{Korean|hangul=대전광역시|labels=no}}).<ref name=":2" />

In the 1980s, the Korean administration began moving various national government operations from Seoul to Daejeon, eventually opening the [[Government Complex, Daejeon|Daejeon Government Complex]] in 1997. Today, the national government offices in Daejeon include Korea Customs Service, Small and Medium Business Administration, Public Procurement Service, National Statistical Office, Military Manpower Administration, [[Korea Forest Service]], [[Cultural Heritage Administration]], [[Korean Intellectual Property Office]], [[Korail]], [[K-water|Korea Water Resources Corporation]], [[Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation]] and Patent Court of Korea.

The population of Daejeon increased dramatically as a result of the government center.<ref>{{cite news |first=Changyeop |last=Oh |title=Daejeon, Larger Population than Gwangju |url=http://www.prometheus.co.kr/articles/113/20060322/20060322151300.html |work=Prometheus |date=22 March 2006 |access-date=22 February 2007 |language=ko |quote={{lang|ko|이러한 대전의 인구증가 요인은 지난 1998년 정부대전청사 이전과 한국철도공사, 특허법원, 대덕연구단지 등이 자리를 잡은 것과 관련이 있다.}} |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928142523/http://www.prometheus.co.kr/articles/113/20060322/20060322151300.html |archive-date=28 September 2007}}</ref> With the construction of [[Sejong City|Sejong Special Self-Governing City]] in 2013 for the division of capital functions and balanced local development, many of the public institutions that had previously headed to Daejeon were moved to Sejong, and many public institutions in [[Seoul]] were also moved to Sejong. With the launch of Sejong City, large-scale development began, resulting in infrastructure construction and large-scale apartment complexes. Sejong is located immediately north of Daejeon, and Daejeon citizens began to outflow to Sejong. As of July 2020, there was net outflow of more than 100,000 people from Daejeon to Sejong.{{Citation needed|date=October 2022}}

==Geography==
[[File:Hiking path along Gapcheon in Daejeon.jpg|thumb|left|Walking path along the Gap River]]

Daejeon lies between latitudes N36°10'59" and N36°30'1" and longitudes E127°14'48" and E127°33'35" near the middle of South Korea. It is {{cvt|167.3|km|mi|1}} from Seoul, {{cvt|294|km|0}} from [[Busan]] and {{cvt|169|km|0}} from [[Gwangju]].

Known historically as 'big field,' the city lies inside a great circle surrounded by several mountains, with [[Gyeryongsan National Park]] straddling the city border on the west, and the foot of the [[Sobaek Mountains|Sobaek Mountain]] range just beyond the city to the south and east. Three rivers run through the center of the city: Gapcheon ({{Korean|hangul=갑천|labels=no}}), Yudeungcheon ({{Korean|hangul=유등천|labels=no}}), and [[Daejeoncheon]] ({{Korean|hangul=대전천|labels=no}}). These flow roughly from south to north, eventually joining the [[Geum River]] which borders the city on the northeast. The river changes direction after leaving Daejeon, turning to the southwest and eventually emptying into the [[Yellow Sea]] near [[Gunsan]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-08-08 |script-title=ko:지형여건 {{!}} 대전광역시청 |url=https://www.daejeon.go.kr/drh/DrhContentsHtmlView.do?menuSeq=2035 |access-date=2022-10-03 |archive-date=8 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220808110051/https://www.daejeon.go.kr/drh/DrhContentsHtmlView.do?menuSeq=2035 |url-status=bot: unknown}}</ref>
