'''Baoji''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|宝鸡}} |t={{linktext|寶雞}} |p=Bǎojī}} {{Audio|Bao3ji1.ogg|Baoji}}) is a [[prefecture-level city]] in western [[Shaanxi]] province, People's Republic of China. Since the early 1990s, Baoji has been the second largest city in [[Shaanxi]].<ref>{{Cite journal |date=1995-10-01 |title=Baoji |journal=Cities |language=en |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=361–368 |doi=10.1016/0264-2751(95)00052-N |issn=0264-2751 |last1=Wang |first1=Ya Ping |last2=Hague |first2=Cliff}}</ref>

==Geography==
The prefecture-level city of Baoji had a population of 3,321,853 according to the 2020 Chinese census, inhabiting an area of {{convert|18159|km²|0|abbr=on}}. The built-up (or metro) area made of 3 urban districts had a population of 1,475,962 inhabitants as of the [[2020 Chinese census]], Fengxiang District not being conurbated yet. Surrounded on three sides by hills, Baoji is in a valley opening out to the east.  Its location is strategic, controlling a pass on the [[Qin Mountains]] between the [[Wei River]] valley and the [[Jialing River]].

==History==
Thriving early in the [[Tang dynasty]], it has roots to 2000 BC.<ref>[http://www.xian-live.com/baoji-index.htm Baoji on line profile, retrieved Dec 9, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113050058/http://www.xian-live.com/baoji-index.htm |date=January 13, 2008 }}</ref> Today it is a large industrial center. Railways first reached Baoji in 1937 and have been key to its modern growth.

[[File:SeidenstrasseGMT.JPG|thumb|left|The Silk Road in its entirety.]]
Passing through Baoji is the ancient [[Northern Silk Road]], the northernmost route of about {{convert|2600|km|0|abbr=off}} in length, which connected the ancient Chinese capital of [[Chang'an]] to the West over the [[Wushao Ling Mountain]] to [[Wuwei, Gansu|Wuwei]] and emerging in [[Kashgar]] before linking to ancient [[Parthia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18006 |title=Silk Road, North China |first=C. M. |last=Hogan |work=the Megalithic Portal |publisher=ed. A. Burnham }}</ref>

Baoji is considered the gateway between western and eastern China since most trains from Beijing, Shanghai and Xi'an pass through here on their way to Gansu, Sichuan, Xinjiang and Tibet (Lhasa). [[Famen Temple|Famen temple]], home to one of Buddha's finger bones, is in Baoji County. The Baoji area was home to the legendary [[Yan Emperor|Yandi]], one of the [[Han Chinese]] forefathers. His tomb is in the southern part of the city and his temple is in the north.

People who are interested in the [[Three Kingdoms]] of [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]] can visit [[Zhuge Liang]]'s Memorial Temple, about {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} from Baoji.

===Ancient trackways===

[[Mount Taibai]] still has some remaining traces of roadways built during the [[Three Kingdoms period]] (220−280 CE) which are all generally unusable due to decay. They remain a popular attraction because they were built by making wood plank bridges along the side of the mountain.

To the south of Baoji lies the beginning of the plank road into the [[Qin Mountains]]. There are also several natural sites such as the [[Jialing Jiang Fountainhead]] with its small waterfalls and forests.  To the north is Bei Puo, a giant hill made of loess with a panoramic view of the city and a landscape dotted with small farming villages that offer local cuisine.

A number of [[Longshan culture|Longshan]] archaeological sites have been found north of the [[Wei River]] near the North Silk Road.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Chinese Neolithic: Trajectories to Early States |author=Li Liu |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-81184-8 }}</ref>

=== Baoji Bronze Museum ===
Baoji is home to the [[Baoji Bronze Museum]] which holds more than 120,000 pieces of cultural relics, primarily of [[Zhou dynasty]] descent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g799520-d1801487-Reviews-Baoji_Bronze_Ware_Museum-Baoji_Shaanxi.html|title=Baoji Bronze Ware Museum - 2018 What to Know Before You Go (with Photos)|website=TripAdvisor|language=en-IN|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>
