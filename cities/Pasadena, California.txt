==History==
{{Main|History of Pasadena, California|Old Town Pasadena}}

===Indigenous history===
The earliest known inhabitants of Pasadena and its surroundings were members of the Native American [[Hahamog-na]] tribe, a branch of the [[Tongva people|Tongva]] Nation. They spoke the [[Tongva language]], part of the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan language]] group. Native Americans had lived in the [[Los Angeles Basin]] for thousands of years.<ref name="city">{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofpasadena.net/History.aspx|title=Pasadena History|website=www.cityofpasadena.net}}</ref>

Pasadena means "valley" in the language of the [[Ojibwe]], a Native American tribe not local to the region. The name was chosen by American colonists from Indiana who would later move to the area.<ref name="nameorigin">{{cite book |last=Reid |first=Hiram A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uRU1AQAAMAAJ |title=History of Pasadena: Comprising an Account of the Native Indian, the Early Spanish, the Mexican, the American, the Colony, and the Incorporated City, Occupancies of the Rancho San Pasqual, and Its Adjacent Mountains, Canyons, Waterfalls and Other Objects of Interest |date=1895 |publisher=Pasadena History Company |pages=339–340}}</ref>

===Spanish era===
The Spanish first colonized the Los Angeles Basin in the 1770s as part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], building the [[San Gabriel Mission]] and renaming the local [[Tongva people]] "Gabrielino Indians", after the name of the mission. Today, several bands of Tongva people live in the Los Angeles area.<ref>[http://tongva.com/ Gabrieleno/Tongva of San Gabriel<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010923234724/http://tongva.com/ |date=September 23, 2001 }}</ref>

===Mexican era===
In 1821, Mexico became independent of Spain, and California came under control of the Mexican government. In 1833, the mission lands were secularized and most of the lands in California were granted to private Mexican citizens in the form of ranchos. Present-day Pasadena was divided between [[Rancho San Rafael]] (lands west of the Arroyo Seco extending to present-day [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] in the northwest to [[Glassell Park]] in the southwest), [[Rancho San Pascual|Rancho del Rincon de San Pascual]],<ref name="city"/> (present-day central Pasadena, [[Altadena]], and [[South Pasadena, California|South Pasadena]]), and [[Rancho Santa Anita]] (present-day east Pasadena, Arcadia, and Monrovia).<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://www.loc.gov/resource/g4363l.la000023/?r=0.468,0.51,0.121,0.06,0|title=Official map of Los Angeles County, California: compiled under instructions and by the order of the Board of Supervisors of Los Angeles County}}</ref> Rancho del Rincon de San Pascual was so named because it was deeded on Easter Sunday to [[Eulalia Perez de Guillén Mariné]] of [[Mission San Gabriel Arcángel]].

===American era===
The last of the Mexican owners of Rancho del Rincon de San Pascual was [[Manuel Garfias]],<ref name="city" /> who retained title to the property through the [[Conquest of California|American conquest of California]] in 1848 and statehood in 1850. Garfias sold sections of the property to the first Anglo settlers to come into the area: [[Benjamin S. Eaton|Dr. Benjamin Eaton]], the father of [[Frederick Eaton|Fred Eaton]]; and Dr. S. Griffin. Much of the property was purchased by [[Benjamin Davis Wilson|Benjamin Wilson]], who established his [[Rancho Huerta de Cuati|Lake Vineyard]] property in the vicinity. Wilson, known as Don Benito to the local Indians,<ref name="city"/> also owned the [[Rancho Jurupa]] ([[Riverside, California]]) and was [[Mayor of Los Angeles, California|mayor of Los Angeles]]. He was the grandfather of WWII General [[George S. Patton, Jr.]] and the namesake of [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]].
[[File:Pasadena panoramic view looking northeast toward mountains, ca.1898-1900 (CHS-274) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|View of Pasadena c. 1898]]
In 1873, Wilson was visited by Dr. Daniel M. Berry of Indiana, who was looking for a place in the country that could offer a mild climate for his patients, most of whom suffered from respiratory ailments. Berry, an asthmatic, concluded that he had his best three nights' sleep at Rancho San Pascual.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Water and Power Associates |url=https://waterandpower.org/museum/Early_Views_of_Pasadena_1_of_8.html |access-date=June 15, 2023 |website=waterandpower.org}}</ref> To keep the find a secret, Berry code-named the area "Muscat" after the grape that Wilson grew. To raise funds to bring the company of people to San Pascual, Berry formed the Southern California Orange and Citrus Growers Association and sold stock in it.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Genealogical Intersection - Pasadena, Los Angeles County, California |url=https://sites.rootsweb.com/~rdrunner/web_data/pi827.htm |access-date=June 15, 2023 |website=sites.rootsweb.com}}{{dead link|date=October 2024}}</ref> The newcomers were able to purchase a large portion of the property along the Arroyo Seco and on January 31, 1874, they incorporated the [[Indiana Colony]]. As a gesture of good will, Wilson added {{convert|2000|acre|km2|0}} of then-useless highland property, part of which would become [[Altadena, California|Altadena]]. [[Pasadena Republican Club#History|Colonel Jabez Banbury]] opened the first school on South Orange Grove Avenue. Banbury had twin daughters, named Jennie and Jessie. The two became the first students to attend Pasadena's first school on Orange Grove.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://waterandpower.org/museum/Early_Views_of_Pasadena.html|title=Water and Power Associates|website=waterandpower.org|access-date=May 15, 2022|archive-date=August 6, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220806100743/https://waterandpower.org/museum/Early_Views_of_Pasadena.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

At the time, the Indiana Colony was a narrow strip of land between the Arroyo Seco and [[Fair Oaks Avenue]]. On the other side of the street was Wilson's Lake Vineyard development.<ref name="National Register">{{Cite web|url=http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/pages/1054/files/late%2019th%20early%2020th%20century%20architecture%20in%20pasadena%20.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221010/http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/pages/1054/files/late%2019th%20early%2020th%20century%20architecture%20in%20pasadena%20.pdf |archive-date=October 10, 2022 |url-status=live|title=National Register of Historic Places Multiple Property Documentation Form}}</ref> After more than a decade of parallel development on both sides, the two settlements merged into the City of Pasadena.<ref name="National Register" />

===Resort town===

The region drew people from across the country. In 1887, the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] opened its Second District and began making stops at the [[Santa Fe Depot (Pasadena)|Santa Fe Depot]] in downtown Pasadena.<ref name="train">{{cite web |title=Cities: Pasadena, CA |url=http://www.trainweb.com/cities/city_pas.html |website=trainweb.com}}</ref> This triggered a real estate boom. Tourist hotels were developed in the city. Pasadena became a winter resort for wealthy Easterners, spurring the development of new neighborhoods and business districts, and increased road and transit connections with Los Angeles.

The first of the hotels to be established in Pasadena was the Raymond (1886) atop Bacon Hill, renamed Raymond Hill after construction.The original Mansard Victorian 200-room facility burned down on Easter morning of 1895, was rebuilt in 1903, and razed during the Great Depression to make way for residential development. The Maryland Hotel existed from the early 1900s and was demolished in 1934.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The world-famous [[Mount Lowe Railway]] and associated mountain hotels shut down four years later due to fire damage. Three hotel structures have survived, the Green Hotel (a co-op since 1926), the Vista Del Arroyo (now used as a Federal courthouse), and a residential tower of the Maryland at 80 North Euclid Avenue (a co-op since 1953).<ref>Thomas D. Carpenter, Pasadena: Resort Hotels and Paradise, March Sheldon Publishing (Azusa, California), 1984, pp. 147-169.</ref>

The [[American Craftsman]] era in art and design is well represented in Pasadena. The architectural firm [[Greene and Greene]] developed the style; many of its residences still stand. Two examples of their [[Ultimate bungalow]] are the masterpiece [[Gamble House (Pasadena, California)|Gamble House]], of which public tours are available, and the [[Robert R. Blacker House]], both designated [[California Historical Landmark]]s and enrolled on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]].

===Contemporary===
[[File:Caltech Military Department 1925.png|thumb|left|The [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1925]]
The [[Second World War]] proved to be a boon to Pasadena as Southern California became a major [[staging area]] for the [[Pacific War]].<ref>[https://www.cityofpasadena.net/about-pasadena/history-of-pasadena/ City of Pasadena - History of Pasadena]</ref> High tech manufacturing and scientific companies made the city their home, a trend which continued in the decades following the war, notably with [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], [[Tetra Tech]] and Ameron International.

In the 1950s, Pasadena saw a steady influx of people from the [[Culture of the Southern United States|Southern United States]], especially [[African-Americans]] from [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]]. Pasadena also began hosting a large immigrant community, particularly from [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Philippines]], [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Italy]], [[Armenia]], and [[India]].

The [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]], founded in 1884 in New York, opened its Pasadena campus in 1974. However, in 2001 the conservatory moved from Pasadena to Hollywood. Training [[actors]] for the [[Theatre|stage]] in a two year program, the conservatory was the first school in the United States to offer professional education in the field of acting. [[Point Loma Nazarene University]] was located in Pasadena for many years before relocating to [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]], and retained the names Pasadena University and Pasadena College.
[[File:Pasadena 1945 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Downtown Pasadena in 1945]]
In 1969, the [[Pasadena Unified School District]] was desegregated, though the issue would continue to be fought in court for a decade. A year later, the [[Interstate 210 and State Route 210 (California)|210 Freeway]] was built along a newly chosen route. The freeway's construction was controversial, as it caused the demolition of over a thousand homes, many historic, and many claimed that the route was designed to cut off the city's less wealthy neighborhoods.

[[Downtown Pasadena, California|Downtown Pasadena]] became dangerous in some parts and deserted in others, and incidences of murder and arson skyrocketed. Old Pasadena faced destruction as plans for new [[high-rise]] developments were drawn up, though they were mostly stopped by increasingly active preservation advocates. Pasadena suffered demographically as many residents moved for the nearby suburbs or the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]], causing an overall decrease in population.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Despite these setbacks, many local artists and [[hipster (1940s subculture)|hipster]]s moved in to take advantage of low property values. Their legacy can be seen today in the [[Doo Dah Parade]] which began in 1976.

In 2014, several arrests were made involving an embezzlement scheme which stole an estimated $6.4 million from the city's Underground Utility Program.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-city-worker-embezzled-6-million-from-pasadena-da-alleges-20141230-story.html |title=Pasadena employee allegedly embezzles $6 million from city |work=Los Angeles Times |date=December 30, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allgov.com/usa/ca/news/where-is-the-money-going/pasadena-accuses-ex-city-employee-of-stealing-64-million-from-slush-fund-141231?news=855237 |title=Pasadena Accuses Ex-City Employee of Stealing $6.4 Million from "Slush Fund" |publisher=allgov.com |date=December 31, 2014}}</ref>

Pasadena has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csa''), with typically hotter summers and slightly cooler winters than nearby coastal areas. Its location relative to the San Gabriel mountains allows the orographic lift to add several more inches of rainfall per year than nearby areas. During the first few months of the year, Pasadena experiences cool to warm highs, typically in the upper 60s ({{convert|60|-|65|F|C|disp=out}}) to lower 70s ({{convert|70|-|75|F|C|disp=out}}). Colder days are usually accompanied by heavier rain. By April, temperatures warm further, and rain tapers off significantly.

By May and June, rain is typically sparse, but the [[marine layer]] becomes more persistent. Locals have dubbed June "[[June Gloom]]" as it is the cloudiest month despite being the 3rd driest month. By July, the marine layer subsides as inland areas cool due to an increased [[monsoon]] flow. Heatwaves from July through October can be oppressive and lengthy. In addition, it rarely rains during the summer and fall months, and only does when the remnants of hurricanes and [[tropical storm]]s pass by. In fact, some days in both July and August have never recorded rainfall.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca6719|title=PASADENA, CALIFORNIA – Period of Record Daily Climate Summary |publisher=Wrcc.dri.edu |access-date=April 14, 2018}}</ref> It is not impossible to go 6 months without measurable precipitation.

The average highest temperature recorded each year is around {{convert|106|F|C}}. The hottest heatwaves of the year usually occur in mid to late September. By late October, temperatures drop off. By November, Pacific storms return to Pasadena, bringing increasingly heavy rain and cooler weather. Along with them, however, are the Santa Ana winds. The [[Santa Ana wind]]s can produce heat, high winds, power outages, tree damage and an increased wildfire threat whenever they strike. By December, lows typically drop into the 40s (below 10&nbsp;°C) with the occasional reading in the 30s (under 5&nbsp;°C and down to freezing). Highs remain around {{convert|68|F|C}} with heatwaves pushing temperatures into the mid-80s (around 30&nbsp;°C). A high temperature of at least {{convert|85|F|C}} has been recorded on all 365 days of the year, with temperatures over {{convert|100|F|C}} possible April through early November.

Pasadena averages {{convert|20.08|in|mm|1}} of rain a year, about {{convert|6|inch|mm|-1}} more than nearby Los Angeles due to the [[orographic rainfall|orographic]] effect created by the [[San Gabriel Mountains]]. The wettest "rain year" was from July 1940 to June 1941 with {{convert|46.32|in|mm|1}} and the driest from July 1960 to June 1961 with {{convert|7.18|in|mm|1}}. Wet years are commonly associated with [[El Niño]] warm surface water in the eastern Pacific and dry years with [[La Niña]] cold water conditions. The most rainfall in one month was {{convert|19.70|in|mm|1}} in February 1980. The most rainfall in 24 hours was {{convert|7.70|in|mm|1}} on March 2, 1938.

[[Old Town Pasadena]] spans 21 blocks downtown. It boasts shops and a wide variety of restaurants, nightclubs, outdoor cafés, pubs, and comedy clubs. "One Colorado" features renovated historic architecture that attracted the new retail stores and restaurants. This development filled vacant buildings and was the impetus of the revitalization of Old Town on [[Colorado Boulevard]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onecolorado.com/facts.html |title=One Colorado |publisher=One Colorado |access-date=January 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120908215947/http://www.onecolorado.com/facts.html |archive-date=September 8, 2012 }}</ref>

[[Paseo Colorado]] is an open-air mall that covers three city blocks, anchored on the west end by upscale grocery store Gelson's (recently closed), on the east end by Macy's (also closed) and Arclight Cinemas centers the middle portion of the mall.

===Tournament of Roses Parade===
[[File:Tournament of Roses Parade 2010 Float.jpg|thumb|right|Theme float "2010: A Cut Above the Rest" rolling down Colorado Boulevard during the parade]]
{{Main|Tournament of Roses Parade}}
Pasadena is home to the Tournament of Roses Parade, held each year on January 1 (or on January 2, if the 1st falls on a Sunday). The first parade was held in 1890 and was originally sponsored by the [[Valley Hunt Club]], a Pasadena [[social club]]. The motivation for having the parade was, as member Professor Charles F. Holder said, "In New York, people are buried in snow. Here our flowers are blooming and our oranges are about to bear. Let's hold a festival to tell the world about our paradise."<ref name="Rose">{{cite web|url=http://discoveringpasadena.com/tournament-of-roses-history|title=Tournament of Roses History|author=Administrator|website=discoveringpasadena.com}}</ref>

By 1895, the festivities had outgrown the Valley Hunt Club, and the [[Pasadena Tournament of Roses|Tournament of Roses Association]] was formed to take charge of the parade. The Rose Parade, as it is familiarly known, traditionally features elaborate floats, bands and equestrian units. According to the organizers, "Every inch of every float must be covered with flowers, or other natural materials, such as leaves, seeds, or bark. On average a float requires about 100,000 flowers and greenery. Volunteer workers swarm over the floats in the days after Christmas, their hands and clothes covered with glue and petals."<ref name="float">{{cite web|url=http://tournamentofroses.com/events/floatdecorating.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404205424/http://tournamentofroses.com/events/floatdecorating.asp|title=Float Decorating ~ Tournament of Roses|archive-date=April 4, 2005}}</ref> The most perishable flowers are placed in small vials of water, which are placed onto the float individually.

The Tournament of Roses also auditions local female high school students to be part of the Rose Court. There are total 7 candidates that advances to the Rose Court and one is chosen to be the Rose Queen and the others to be the Rose Princess. The Rose Court's main goal is to support local communities and local stores. They visit small stores owned by local residents to boost the activity of the area and to keep them in the current flow of the economics.

During the Rose Parade, the Rose Court members are also on a float, going through the parade together with the line of parades. The Rose Courts also represent their own local communities and their high school that they attend.

===Rose Bowl Game===
{{see also|Rose Bowl Game}}
The [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]], a [[National Historic Landmark]], is host of the first and most famous [[college football]] postseason [[bowl game]], the [[Pasadena Tournament of Roses|Tournament of Roses]] Rose Bowl Game, every New Year's Day. In 1895, the Tournament of Roses Association was formed to take charge of the parade. In 1902, the association declared that a football game would be added to the day's events. This was the first post-season college football game to be played on New Year's Day and is known as, "The Grandaddy of Them All"; many other football stadiums followed suit. After two decades, the game outgrew its original facility, and a new stadium was constructed in the Arroyo Seco area. The new stadium hosted its first New Year's Day football game in 1923. It was soon christened "The Rose Bowl", as was [[Rose Bowl Game|the game itself]].<ref name="Rose" />

The 1960s song "[[The Little Old Lady from Pasadena]]" parodies a popular Southern California image of Pasadena as home to a large population of aged eccentrics. In the song, [[Jan and Dean]] sing of an elderly lady who drives a powerful "[[Dodge 330|Super Stock Dodge]]" [[muscle car]] and is "the terror of Colorado Boulevard". The [[Dead Kennedys]] paid a tribute to this archetypal song in the track "Buzzbomb From Pasadena" in the album ''[[Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death]]''. Pasadena was also the location of the 2012 film [[Project X (2012 film)|Project X]].

===Visual arts===
A number of artists of national repute, such as [[Guy Rose]], [[Alson S. Clark]], [[Marion Wachtel]] and [[Ernest A. Batchelder]], of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], made Pasadena their home in the early twentieth century.

===Orange Grove Boulevard===
{{main|Orange Grove Boulevard}}
[[File:Tournament House.jpg|thumb|Tournament House]]
The [[Norton Simon Museum]] is at the intersection of Orange Grove and Colorado Boulevards. This corner is the official start of the Rose Parade route and the museum can be quite clearly seen every year during the parade television broadcast.

Orange Grove Boulevard is one of several exclusive residential districts in Pasadena, and has been a home for the rich and famous since the early 20th century. Because of the number of landmark mansions, the street earned the name [[Millionaire's Row]], an appropriate sobriquet considering that the estates that once lined this spacious boulevard and the surrounding neighborhood read like a [[Who's Who]] of American consumer products.

====Trains====

Pasadena was served by the [[Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad]], which in 1906 became the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]], at a [[Santa Fe Depot (Pasadena)|Santa Fe Depot]] in downtown when the Second District was opened in 1887.<ref name="train" /> In 1925, the historical and traditionally styled station in Pasadena was opened.<ref name="train"/> Originally, the Second District was an invaluable line; it served manufacturing and agricultural businesses throughout the entire San Gabriel Valley. But longer trains had great difficulty climbing the precipitous 2.2% grade at [[Arroyo Seco (Los Angeles County)|Arroyo Seco]], between Pasadena and Los Angeles, requiring the costly addition of extra locomotives. The still-used Third District opened in 1888, just a year after the Second District, and rapidly took over most of the longer freight trains.<ref name="train"/>

The Second District and the Pasadena Depot became well known; up to 26 passenger trains went through Pasadena every day. To avoid the media in Los Angeles, many celebrities chose to use Pasadena as their main train station, bringing it an association with old Hollywood.<ref name="train"/><ref name="La times"/>

[[Amtrak]] took over passenger rail operations in 1971, serving Pasadena with trains such as the ''[[Southwest Chief]]'', ''[[Las Vegas Limited]]'', and ''[[Desert Wind]]''. On January 15, 1994, the final ''[[Southwest Chief]]'' train arrived in Pasadena.<ref name="La times">{{cite news|title=Final Boarding Call Nostalgia|author=Bob Pool|date=January 15, 1994|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=Los Angeles}}</ref> ATSF sold the line between Los Angeles and San Bernardino via Pasadena (known as the "second division") following the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]] which damaged a bridge in [[Arcadia, California|Arcadia]] used by the line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trainweb.org/chris/Goldline.html|title=Los Angeles to Pasadena Metro Gold Line - Gold Line Grand Opening 7/26/2003}}</ref> (Now the ''Southwest Chief'' operates over the [[Southern Transcon|transcon]] via Fullerton.) The LACMTA A Line uses the [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] after rebuilding the route to accommodate light rail in 2003. The old depot is still visible at the [[Del Mar (LACMTA station)|Del Mar station]], though it has since been converted into a restaurant. Electrified Light Rail was the preferred alternative to Metrolink or similar style rail service due to the city of Pasadena voting against any further diesel locomotives traversing through the city.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Barber |first=Mary |date=May 1, 1986 |title=Goodby, Pasadena : Desert Wind Whistles Into Railroad History |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-05-01-ga-2962-story.html |access-date=June 15, 2023 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US}}</ref> The construction of the Gold Line also allowed the closure of the former railroad crossing along Colorado Boulevard which meant that motorists and the Rose Parade would no longer be hindered by trains.

====Airports====
[[Hollywood Burbank Airport]] in nearby [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] serves as the regional airport for Pasadena. The airport is owned and operated by the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority. The airport is under the control of the governments of the three cities named. While most destinations from Hollywood Burbank Airport are within the United States, [[Los Angeles International Airport]] and [[Ontario International Airport]] are the major airports that provide domestic and international commercial service. Other nearby airports with commercial service include [[Long Beach Airport]] and [[John Wayne Airport]].

====Freeways and highways====
Four freeways run through Pasadena, and Pasadena is a [[control city]] for all of them. The most important is the [[Interstate 210 and State Route 210 (California)|Foothill Freeway (I-210)]] which enters the northwestern portion of the city from [[La Cañada Flintridge, California|La Cañada Flintridge]]. The Foothill Freeway initially runs due south, passing the [[Rose Bowl Stadium|Rose Bowl]] before its junction with the [[California State Route 134|Ventura Freeway]]. At this interchange, the Foothill Freeway shifts its alignment and direction, becoming an east-west freeway, exiting the city on its eastern boundary before entering [[Arcadia, California|Arcadia]]. The Foothill Freeway connects Pasadena with [[San Fernando, California|San Fernando]] (westbound) and [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] (eastbound).

The [[California State Route 134|Ventura Freeway (SR 134)]] starts at the junction of the [[Interstate 210 and State Route 210 (California)|Foothill Freeway (I-210)]] at the edge of downtown Pasadena and travels westward. This freeway is the main connector to the [[Hollywood Burbank Airport]] and the [[San Fernando Valley]].

A spur of the [[California State Route 710|Long Beach Freeway (SR 710 in Pasadena)]] is also located in Pasadena. The Long Beach Freeway was intended to connect [[Long Beach, CA|Long Beach]] to Pasadena but a gap, known as the [[Interstate 710#The South Pasadena Gap|South Pasadena Gap]], between [[Alhambra, California|Alhambra]] and Pasadena has not been completed due to legal battles primarily involving the city of South Pasadena. The spur starts at the junction of the [[California State Route 134|Ventura Freeway]] and [[Interstate 210 and State Route 210 (California)|Foothill Freeway]] and travels south along the eastern edge of Old Pasadena with two exits for [[Colorado Boulevard]] and Del Mar Boulevard before ending at an at-grade intersection with California Boulevard. Efforts to complete the Long Beach Freeway were met with strong opposition, including the possibility of using advanced tunneling technologies to overcome objections.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://la.curbed.com/2017/2/10/14580430/new-state-bill-would-block-a-710-freeway-tunnel|title=New state bill would block a 710 Freeway tunnel|last=Lee|first=Patrick|date=February 10, 2017|website=Curbed LA|language=en|access-date=October 31, 2019}}</ref> The gap will no longer be constructed, with the $780 million earmarked for constructing the gap now allocated towards local infrastructure improvements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/la-metro-committee-approves-500m-in-710-freeway-gap-closure-dollars-for-local-road-improvements|title=LA Metro committee approves $500M in 710 freeway gap closure dollars for local road improvements|date=November 15, 2018|website=Pasadena Star News|language=en-US|access-date=October 31, 2019}}</ref> Pasadena is exploring options on the future of the spur.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pasadenastarnews.com/2017/11/01/pasadena-is-already-planning-what-it-wants-to-built-on-top-of-710-freeway-stub-is-caltrans-kills-extension-project/|title=Pasadena is already planning what it wants to build on top of 710 Freeway stub if Caltrans kills extension project|date=November 1, 2017|website=Pasadena Star News|language=en-US|access-date=October 31, 2019}}</ref>

[[File:Pasadena Colorado Street Bridge 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Colorado Street Bridge seen from the Arroyo Seco below]]
The [[Arroyo Seco Parkway|Arroyo Seco Parkway (SR 110)]], also known as the Pasadena Freeway, was the first freeway in California, connecting Los Angeles with Pasadena alongside the [[Arroyo Seco (Los Angeles County)|Arroyo Seco]] and is the primary access to [[Downtown Los Angeles]]. The freeway enters the southern part of the city from South Pasadena. Only one exit is actually inside city limits, the southbound exit connecting to State Street with access to [[Fair Oaks Avenue]]. At Glenarm Street, the freeway ends and the four-lane Arroyo Parkway continues northward to Old Pasadena.

Three state highways enter the city of Pasadena. Arroyo Parkway (SR 110), maintained by the city of Pasadena, runs from the termination of the Pasadena Freeway at Glenarm Street to Colorado Boulevard in Old Town Pasadena. While Arroyo Parkway continues north two more blocks, SR 110 ends at Holly Street.

[[Rosemead Boulevard]] (formerly [[California State Route 19|SR 19]]) is a state highway in [[East Pasadena, California|unincorporated Pasadena]] from Huntington Drive to [[Foothill Boulevard (Southern California)|Foothill Boulevard]].

A portion of the [[Angeles Crest Highway]] ([[California State Route 2|SR 2]]) in the [[San Gabriel Mountains]] cuts through Pasadena near the Angeles Crest Ranger Station. This {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of highway in the Angeles National Forest is north of [[La Cañada Flintridge, California|La Cañada Flintridge]] and west of [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]] and is approximately {{convert|3000|ft|m}} in elevation.

Historic [[U.S. Route 66 (California)|U.S. Route 66]] ran through Pasadena until it was decommissioned in 1964. The historic highway entered Pasadena from the east on Colorado Boulevard and then jogged south on Arroyo Parkway before becoming part of the [[Pasadena Freeway|Pasadena Freeway (SR 110)]].

The intersection of [[Fair Oaks Avenue (Pasadena, California)|Fair Oaks Avenue]] and Colorado Boulevard in Old Pasadena is the zero-zero, east-west, north-south postal division of Pasadena.

===Water and power ===
[[File:Pasadena-waterpower-fountain.jpg|thumb|Water and Light Fountain at the historic [[Glenarm Power Plant]]. Designed by Harold H. Lewis in 1938.]]
The city Water and Power Department (PWP) provides services to an area encompassing {{convert|60|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|order=flip}} that includes areas outside of the city proper, including unincorporated areas of southern Altadena, East Pasadena, Chapman Woods, and East San Gabriel. PWP has operated the [[Glenarm Power Plant]] for over 110 years.

Pasadena created the Pasadena Municipal Light and Power Department in 1906. Expanding continued and more generating capacity was expanded and the city then offered power to commercial customers in 1908, and bought out [[Southern California Edison]]'s Pasadena operations in 1920.<ref name="power">{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofpasadena.net/waterandpower/Our_History/ |title=City of Pasadena Department of Water and Power |publisher=www.cityofpasadena.net |access-date=January 8, 2012 |archive-date=June 30, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630220248/http://cityofpasadena.net/waterandpower/Our_History/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1911, the city began condemnation actions against a number of small, local water companies. In 1912, the Water Department was created; in 1913, it began actual operations. The city continued to acquire small, local water companies for several decades afterwards, usually ''en toto'', such as the Pasadena Lake Vineyard and Land Company, and sometimes in part, such as Las Flores Water Company's southern portions and San Gabriel Valley Water Company's operations in the southern reaches of Pasadena. In 1967, the Water Department and the Light and Power department were consolidated into the "Pasadena Water and Power Department" (or PWP).<ref name="power"/>

It operates a number of water wells, has a spreading ground for the capture of surface water from the Arroyo Seco, and purchases surface water from MWDSC. A number of wells on the west side of the service area had become contaminated with volatile organic chemicals and perchlorate and had to be shut down several years. A treatment plant was built to remove these chemicals which began operation in July 2011.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}
