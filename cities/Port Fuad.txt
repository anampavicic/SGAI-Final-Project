'''Port Fuad''' or '''Port Fouad''' ({{langx|ar|بورفؤاد}} ''{{transl|ar|Borfoʾād}}'', {{IPA|ar|boɾ.foˈʔæːd|IPA}}) is a city in [[Port Said Governorate]], [[Egypt]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shores|first1=Louis|title=Collier's Encyclopedia: With Bibliography and Index|date=1963|publisher=Crowell-Collier Publishing Company|page=265|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MjJsdyamWnUC|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Gellhorn|first1=Eleanor Cowles|title=McKay's Guide to the Middle East|date=1965|publisher=McKay Company|page=[https://archive.org/details/mckaysguidetomid00gell/page/91 91]|url=https://archive.org/details/mckaysguidetomid00gell|url-access=registration|language=en}}</ref> Port Fuad is located in northeastern Egypt at the northwesternmost tip of the [[Sinai Peninsula]] on the Asian side of the [[Suez Canal]], across from the city of [[Port Said]]. Port Fuad is considered a [[suburb]] of Port Said and together they form a [[metropolitan area]] of over one million residents. Along with the likes of [[Colón, Panama|Colón]], [[Panama]] ([[North America|North]]/[[South America]]) and [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]] ([[Asia]]/[[Europe]]), it is one of the few transcontinental cities in the world, in that spans it across two [[continent]]s ([[Africa]]/[[Asia]]).

Port Fuad has a population of 81,591 (as of 2015).<ref name="El-Bastawisy"/><ref name="Asof2006" />

== History ==
Port Fuad was established in 1926, principally to relieve overcrowding in [[Port Said]], and was named after King [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]] (also transliterated as ''Fouad''), the first holder of the title [[King of Egypt]] in the modern era (having previously held the title [[Sultan of Egypt]]).<ref name="Asof2006" />

[[File:Port Fouad,Egypt.jpg|thumb|View of the city]]

After the war of 1967 Port Fuad was the only piece of Sinai held by the Egyptians. The Israeli army tried to capture Port Fuad during the [[War of Attrition]], but failed. After the [[Yom Kippur War|October War]], the [[Camp David Accord]] in 1978 Israel agreed to return Sinai to Egypt peacefully, and later the two countries signed a peace treaty. Today Port Fuad is a major Air Defence Position for Egypt. Despite its important location, as of 2006, Port Fuad was still considered a residential zone, with very few facilities and no major downtown or city center.<ref name="Asof2006">{{cite book|last1=Cavendish|first1=Cavendish|title=World and Its Peoples, Volumen 1|date=September 1, 2006|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|page=1130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j894miuOqc4C&dq=port+fuad&pg=PA1130|access-date=22 October 2016|isbn=9780761475712}}</ref>

== Geography ==
The city is located on Port Fuad Island, a triangular island bounded by the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] to the North, the Suez Canal to the West, and the relatively new eastern channel from the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean to the East.<ref name="El-Bastawisy">{{cite journal|last1=El-Bastawisy|first1=Magdy M.|title=Incorporating Local Urban Environmental Conservation and Regional Development: Port Fouad, Egypt|journal=Procedia Environmental Sciences|volume=34|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|pages=271–284|language=en|doi=10.1016/j.proenv.2016.04.025|date=1 January 2016|doi-access=free}}</ref> Lying on the eastern side of the main canal.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McLachlan|first1=Anne|last2=McLachlan|first2=Keith Stanley|title=Egypt handbook|date=2000|publisher=Footprint|isbn=9781900949682|page=399|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xQwuAQAAIAAJ|language=en|quote=It is one of Port Said's suburbs, ... and thus being part of Asia}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The Near East|date=1922|volume=22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CUEZAAAAYAAJ|publisher=s.n.|language=en|quote=The Suez Canal Co. is ... at Port Fouad, opposite Port Said, on the Asiatic side of the canal ...}}</ref>

The [[Suez Canal Authority]] forms the main employment of the city, and its employees comprise most of the population. It has one general hospital.<ref name="Asof2006" />

== Transport ==
[[File:Port Fuad, Suez Canal 006.JPG|left|thumb|The ferry from Port Said]]

Until 2016 the town was accessible only by Ferry to Port Said.<ref name="Asof2006" /> Three ferry lines: the "Port Fouad Ferry" and "Al-Raswa Ferry" from Port Said, and the "Tafreea Ferry" from Port Said East.<ref name="Boulos">{{cite journal|last1=Boulos|first1=Jacqueline|title=Sustainable Development of Coastal Cities-Proposal of a Modelling Framework to Achieve Sustainable City-Port Connectivity|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|volume=216|page=981|language=en|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.12.094|date=6 January 2016|doi-access=free}}</ref>
