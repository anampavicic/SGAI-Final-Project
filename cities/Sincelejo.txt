'''Sincelejo''' ({{IPA|es|sinseˈlexo}}) is the capital and largest city of the [[Colombia|Colombian]] department of [[Sucre Department|Sucre]] in the [[Caribbean region of Colombia|Caribbean region]]. It is also the capital of the department's subregion, ''Sabanas'', and is the [[List of Colombian municipalities by population|25th largest city by population]] of the country.<ref name=":0">http://www.dane.gov.co Censo 2005 Dane</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Telefónicas |first=Telencuestas-Encuestas |title=Censos de Población de Colombia |url=https://telencuestas.com/censos-de-poblacion/colombia |access-date=2024-02-01 |website=Telencuestas |language=es}}</ref> It is located 30 kilometers from the [[Caribbean Sea]] at the [[Gulf of Morrosquillo]], 125 kilometers from [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], and 200 kilometers from [[Barranquilla]].

==Etymology==
The origin of the name ''Sincelejo'' is a subject of controversy, and there is no consensus on its source. The most widely accepted theory is that the Spanish city is named after the [[cacique]], Cincel, who is believed to have been the leader of the indigenous people who inhabited the area where the town was founded. One author states, without citation, that this theory is supported by documents in the General National Archives (AGN) in Bogota.

== History ==
In the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-columbian era]], the regions lands were inhabited by several groups of indigenous people known as the [[Zenú]]. 

The village of Sincelejo was founded on October 4, 1535, the [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] of [[Francis of Assis]]i, with the name '''San Francisco de Asís de Sincelejo'''. The village was part of Alonso Padilla's ''[[encomienda]]'' between 1610 and 1640, and was located on the site of a small Zenú indigenous settlement. At that time, the indigenous people were exploited by the Spanish colonizers, or "encomenderos". 

On November 21, 1775, Sincelejo was re-founded by the Spanish captain and engineer, Antonio de la Torre y Miranda, following orders from [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]]'s governor, [[Juan de Torrezar Díaz Pimienta]]. The construction of the town began with a church, while the lands around the church were given to people who used to live across the region; in order to create a religious and political center within the region. The city plan of Sincelejo was intended to follow the classical Spanish colonial grid, with the main church and its square in the center of the town, but this was not possible because of several creeks that ran through its center. 

In 1812, Sincelejo became shelter for the revolutionary priests in ''La Rebelión de los Curas'' (the Priests' Insurrection).

By 1887, Sincelejo was one of the largest settlements in the [[Province of Cartagena]]. In 1908 it became the capital of the short-lived department of Sincelejo (Spanish: ''Departamento de Sincelejo''), ultimately becoming part of the Province of Cartagena again in 1910. In 1912, Sincelejo was nearly destroyed by a [[conflagration]] which consumed most of the central zone; nevertheless the town was rebuilt. With the creation of the [[Sucre Department]] in 1966, Sincelejo subsequently became its capital.

== Geography ==
The geography of Sincelejo is characterized by a hilly landscape which extends from the mountains to the borders of the plateau in the north and south. The small mountain foothills in the municipality span from the [[Fluvial plain|marine fluvial plain]] in the west to the border shared with the town of [[Palmito]]. Erosion is common in the rugged topography of the rolling hills, which are moderately to strongly broken, with slopes between 7 and 50% and altitudes ranging from 50 to 260 meters.

Sincelejo is bordered by the municipalities of [[Palmito, Sucre|Palmito]] and [[Tolú]] to the west, [[Sampués]] and [[Córdoba Department]] to the south, [[Corozal, Sucre|Corozal]] and [[Morroa]] to the east, and [[Toluviejo]] to the north.

=== Climate ===
Sincelejo has a tropical climate and its temperatures remain fairly consistent throughout the year, with an average temperature of about 27&nbsp;°C ( 80.6&nbsp;°F). According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], it has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] (''Aw'') .

The drought season usually starts in December and lasts until the end of February. The [[rainy season]] then peaks in April or May. In June and July [[precipitation]] decreases, in a period called "''Veranillo de San Juan''", until it increases once more.

The largest sector within Sincelejo is its livestock sector, and the city has been called the "Capital Cebuísta de Colombia" (English: ''[[Zebu]] Capital of Colombia'') for its prized beef cattle production. Sincelejo also has a significant dairy farming sector, but beef cattle are the dominant contributor to the city's economy. Agriculture is the city's second largest sector, and is characterized by the production of [[maize]], [[cassava]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], and [[bananas]].

=== Corraleja ===
[[File:Corraleja in Colombia 1.png|thumb|300px|Minnor Corraleja in Sincelejo]]
Sincelejo is best known for its annual festival called ''Fiestas del dulce nombre de Jesús'' (English: ''Celebrations of the Sweet Name of Jesus''), which is held every year on January 20. The entire festival lasts several days, and includes a number of [[Parade|parades]], a [[Beauty pageant|beauty contest]], and [[bullfighting]]. 

Because of the bullfighting tradition, the festival is also known as ''Las Fiestas de [[Corraleja]]'', so named after the temporary wooden [[bullring]] used for the event, called a corraleja. On January 20, 1980, a combination of [[overcrowding]] and panic caused the bullring's wooden bleachers to collapse, killing at least 222 people, although some estimates place the total number at 400.<ref name="HIS">{{Cite web|title=Bullfight spectators die when bleachers collapse|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/bullfight-spectators-die-when-bleachers-collapse|access-date=January 12, 2017|website=history.com|publisher=A&E Television Networks, LLC.}}</ref> As a result of this tragedy, the Corraleja part of the festival was suspended for several years. In 1999, the municipality reauthorised the annual construction of the wooden structure, which reinstated the bullfighting tradition. Today, the construction of the temporary bullring starts towards the end of December, and civil engineers and architects supervise the project.

The bullfighting usually takes place over several days, with different cattle farms supplying about 40 bulls per day. On the final day, the cattle farm with the most entertaining performance is given an official reward. There is no official prize for [[bullfighter]]s who enter the ring and participate in the festival, but wealthy landowners often offer an unofficial monetary incentive to encourage participation. The [[picador]]s are usually sourced from local cattle ranches and are paid for their work, though they also benefit from "unofficial incentives". A single day ticket to watch the event typically costs about 15–35 [[USD]], though the last day of the event is usually more expensive.

Like other bullfighting events, the festival is criticized for animal cruelty. It is also subject to criticism for the consumption of alcohol during the event and the lack of training and safety provided to bullfighters. Anyone participating in the event as a bullfighter must purchase insurance, which is sold on site, to cover emergency medical care in the ring.
