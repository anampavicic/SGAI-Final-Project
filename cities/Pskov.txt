'''Pskov''' ({{lang-rus|Псков|a=Ru-Псков.oga|p=pskof}}; see also [[Names of Pskov in different languages|names in other languages]]) is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] in northwestern [[Russia]] and the [[administrative center]] of [[Pskov Oblast]], located about {{convert|20|km|sp=us}} east of the [[Estonia]]n border, on the [[Velikaya|Velikaya River]]. Population: {{ru-census|p2021=193,082|p2010=203,279|p2002=202,780|p1989=203,789}}

Pskov is one of the oldest cities in Russia. During the [[Middle Ages]], it served as the capital of the [[Pskov Republic]] and was a trading post of the [[Hanseatic League]] before it was incorporated into the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and became an important border fortress in the [[Tsardom of Russia]].

===Early history===
[[File:Вид на Псковский Кром с реки Великой, 2014..jpg|thumb|left|View of the Pskov Kremlin from the Velikaya River in 2014]]
Pskov is one of the oldest cities in Russia. The name of the city, originally '''Pleskov''' (historic Russian spelling {{lang|ru|Плѣсковъ}}, {{Transliteration|ru|Plěskov}}), may be loosely translated as "[the town] of [[:wikt:purling|purling]] waters". It was historically known in English as '''Plescow'''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bacon|first1=George A|title=The Academy: A Journal of Secondary Education, Volume 4|date=1889|page=403}}</ref> 

Its earliest mention comes in 903,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Borrero |first1=Mauricio |title=Russia: A Reference Guide from the Renaissance to the Present |date=2009 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-0-8160-7475-4 |page=285 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dhm0cGdrTOIC |language=en}}</ref> which records that [[Igor of Kiev]] married a local lady, [[Olga of Kiev|Olga]] (later Saint Olga of Kiev).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Esmark |first1=Kim |last2=Hermanson |first2=Lars |last3=Orning |first3=Hans Jacob |title=Nordic Elites in Transformation, c. 1050–1250, Volume II: Social Networks |date=2020 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781000037340 |chapter=Early Scandinavian power centers in the east}}</ref> Pskovians sometimes take this year as the city's foundation date, and in 2003 a great jubilee took place to celebrate Pskov's 1,100th anniversary.

The first prince of Pskov was [[Vladimir the Great]]'s youngest son [[Sudislav]]. Once imprisoned by his brother [[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslav]], he was not released until the latter's death several decades later. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the town adhered politically to the [[Novgorod Republic]]. In 1241, it was taken by the [[Teutonic Knights]], but [[Alexander Nevsky]] recaptured it several months later during a legendary campaign dramatized in [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s 1938 [[Alexander Nevsky (film)|movie ''Alexander Nevsky'']].

In order to secure their independence from the knights, the Pskovians elected a [[Lithuania]]n prince, named [[Daumantas of Pskov|Daumantas]], a Roman Catholic converted to Orthodox faith and known in Russia as Dovmont, as their military leader and prince in 1266. Having fortified the town, Daumantas routed the Teutonic Knights at [[Battle of Wesenberg (1268)|Rakvere]] and overran much of Estonia. His remains and sword are preserved in the local [[Kremlin (fortification)|kremlin]], and the core of the citadel, erected by him, still bears the name of "Dovmont's town".

In 1341 the city recognized overlordship of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], in 1347 it switched allegiance to the [[Novgorod Republic]], and the following year it became the capital of the newly independent [[Pskov Republic]].<ref name=sgk/>

===Pskov Republic===
{{Main|Pskov Republic}}

By the 14th century, the town functioned as the capital of a [[Pskov Republic|''de facto'' sovereign republic]]. Its most powerful force was the merchants who traded with the [[Hanseatic League]]. Pskov's independence was formally recognized by Novgorod in 1348.<ref name=sgk>{{cite book|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Słownik geograficzny Królestwa Polskiego i innych krajów słowiańskich, Tom IX|year=1888|language=pl|location=Warszawa|pages=249–250}}</ref> Several years later, the [[veche]] promulgated a law code (called the [[Pskov Judicial Charter|Pskov Charter]]), which was one of the principal sources of the [[Sudebnik of 1497|all-Russian law code]] issued in 1497.

Already in the 13th century German merchants were present in ''Zapskovye'' area of Pskov and the [[Hanseatic League]] had a trading post in the same area in the first half of 16th century which moved to ''Zavelichye'' after a fire in 1562.<ref>{{cite book |title= The German Hansa|last= Dollinger|first= Philippe|author-link= Philippe Dollinger|year= 1999 |publisher= Psychology Press|isbn= 9780415190732|page= 105}}</ref><ref name = PskovHansa>Аракчеев владимир Анатольевич, [http://hansarus.org/uploads/Files/FINAL_Pskov_Hansa.pdf Псков и Ганза в эпоху средневековья], ООО «Дизайн экспресс», 2012 {{in lang|ru}}</ref> The wars with [[Livonian War|Livonian Order, Poland-Lithuania]] and Sweden interrupted the trade but it was maintained until the 17th century, with Swedish merchants gaining the upper hand eventually.<ref name = PskovHansa/>

The importance of the city made it the subject of numerous sieges throughout its history. The [[Pskov Krom]] (or Kremlin) withstood twenty-six sieges in the 15th century alone. At one point, five stone walls ringed it, making the city practically impregnable. A local school of [[icon]]-painting flourished, and the local masons were considered the best in Russia. Many peculiar features of [[Russian architecture]] were first introduced in Pskov.

===Grand Duchy of Moscow===

Finally, in 1510, the city was annexed by the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]].<ref name="nyt79">Maclean, Fitzroy (18 March 1979).  [https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/18/archives/pskov-a-journey-into-russias-past-pskov-an-old-russian-city.html Pskov: A Journey Into Russia's Past], ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref> Three hundred families were deported from Pskov to central Russia,<ref name=sgk/> and merchants and military families from Muscovy were settled in the city. At this time Pskov had at least 6,500 households and a population of more than 30,000; it was one of the three biggest cities of Muscovy, alongside Moscow and Novgorod.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Зимин |first1=А.А|title=Россия на пороге Нового времени (Очерки политической истории России первой трети XVI в.)|chapter=Глава 6.

===Tsardom of Russia===
[[File:BrullovKP OsadaPskovPolGTG.jpg|thumb|left|''Siege of Pskov by [[Stephen Báthory]]'', by [[Karl Bryullov]].]]
The deportation of noble families to [[Moscow]] under Ivan IV in 1570 is a subject of [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov |Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s [[opera]] ''[[The Maid of Pskov|Pskovityanka]]'' (1872). Pskov still attracted enemy armies and it withstood [[Siege of Pskov|a prolonged siege]] by a 50,000-strong [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth |Polish-Lithuanian]] army during the final stage of the [[Livonian War]] (1581–1582). The king of Poland [[Stephen Báthory]] undertook some thirty-one attacks to storm the city, which was defended mainly by civilians. Even after one of the city walls was broken, the Pskovians managed to fill the gap and repel the attack. "A big city, it is like Paris", wrote Báthory's secretary about Pskov.<ref>{{cite book |title= Ivan the Terrible |section = Peace Negotiations |last= de Madariaga|first= Isabel|year= 2006 |publisher= Yale University Press |isbn= 978-0-30014376-8 |page = 526}}</ref>

The estimates of the population of Pskov land in the middle of 16th century range from 150 to 300 thousand. Famines, epidemics (especially the epidemic of 1552) and the warfare led to a five-fold decrease of the population by 1582–1585 due to mortality and migration.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Горская |first1= Наталья Александровна |title=Историческая демография России эпохи феодализма: итоги и проблемы изучения |date=1994 |publisher= Наука |location=Москва |isbn= 978-502009750-6 |pages=94–97|language=ru}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1= Turchin |first1=Peter |last2=Nefedov|first2=Sergey |author1-link=Peter Turchin |title= Secular cycles |date= 2009 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-13696-7 |pages=244–45, 251–52}})</ref>

The city withstood a [[Siege of Pskov (1615)|siege by the Swedish]] in 1615. The successful defence of the city led to the peace negotiations culminating in the [[Treaty of Stolbovo]].

===Russian Empire===
[[File:Pskov old photo.jpg|thumb|Pskov in 1911]]
[[Peter the Great]]'s conquest of [[Governorate of Estonia|Estonia]] and [[Governorate of Livonia|Livonia]] during the [[Great Northern War]] in the early 18th century spelled the end of Pskov's traditional role as a vital border fortress and a key to Russia's interior. As a consequence, the city's importance and well-being declined dramatically, although it served as a seat of separate [[Pskov Governorate]] since 1777. In 1897, the ethnic make-up, by mother tongue, was 80.0% Russian, {{nowrap|5.7% Polish}}, 4.7% Jewish, 4.3% German, 2.4% Latvian, 2.1% Estonian.<ref name=c1897>{{cite book|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=Первая Всеобщая перепись населения Российской империи, 1897 г.|volume=XXXIV|year=1904|language=ru|pages=48–51}}</ref>

During [[World War I]], Pskov became the headquarters for Russia's [[Northern Front (Russian Empire)|Northern Front]], commanded by [[Nikolai Ruzsky]].  On 15 March 1917, aboard the [[Imperial Train#Russian Empire|Imperial train]],  [[Tsar Nicholas II]] abdicated here.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Massie |first1=Robert |title=Nicholas and Alexandria |date=1967 |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York |isbn=9780345438317 |pages=412–417}}</ref> After the Russo-German [[Brest-Litovsk]] Peace Conference (22&nbsp;December 1917 – 3&nbsp;March 1918), the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German Army]] invaded the area. 

Pskov was also occupied by the [[Estonia]]n army between 25 May 1919 and 28 August 1919 during the [[Estonian War of Independence]] when the [[White Movement|White Russian]] commander [[Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz]] became the military administrator of Pskov. He personally ceded most of his responsibilities to a democratically elected municipal duma and focused on both cultural and economical recovery of the war-impoverished city. He also put an end to censorship of press and allowed for creation of several socialist associations and newspapers.

===Recent history===
Under the Soviet government, large parts of the city were rebuilt, many ancient buildings, particularly churches, were demolished to give space for new constructions. During [[World War II]], in June 1940, the [[8th Army (Soviet Union)|Soviet 8th Army]] invaded Estonia and [[Latvia]] from the city.<ref>{{cite book|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |year=2016|title=Eestlased vene sõjaväes 1940–1945.

The Germans operated a [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]] camp for [[Jews|Jewish]] men and women.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&tab=7&id=100000344|title=Zwangsarbeitslager für Juden Pleskau|website=Bundesarchiv.de|access-date=9 January 2024|language=de}}</ref> In February 1944, thousands of people were killed during Russian bombings of the city.<ref name=ee>{{cite web|url=https://ekspress.delfi.ee/artikkel/69073543/pihkva-pole-enam-kaugel|title="Pihkva pole enam kaugel!"|website=Eesti Ekspress|access-date=9 January 2024|language=et}}</ref> A huge portion of the population died during the war, and Pskov has since struggled to regain its traditional position as a major industrial and cultural center of western Russia.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Pskov is the [[administrative center]] of the [[oblast]] and, within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it also serves as the administrative center of [[Pskovsky District]], even though it is not a part of it.<ref name="Ref414">Law #833-oz</ref> As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the '''[[City of federal subject significance|City]] of Pskov'''—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Pskov Oblast|districts]].<ref name="Ref414" /> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the City of Pskov is incorporated as '''Pskov Urban Okrug'''.<ref name="Ref863">Law #419-oz.</ref>

==Landmarks and sights==
{{Onesource|section|date=August 2022}}
[[File:Pskov Krom.jpg|thumb|left|Pskov Krom, view from the [[Velikaya River]]]]
Pskov still preserves much of its medieval walls, built from the 13th century on. Its medieval [[citadel]] is called either the Krom or the Kremlin. Within its walls rises the {{convert|256|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} [[Trinity Cathedral in Pskov|Trinity Cathedral]], founded in 1138 and rebuilt in the 1690s. The cathedral contains the tombs of saint princes [[Vsevolod of Pskov|Vsevolod]] (died in 1138) and [[Daumantas of Pskov|Dovmont]] (died in 1299). Other ancient cathedrals adorn the [[Mirozhsky Monastery]] (completed by 1152), famous for its 12th-century [[fresco]]es, St.&nbsp;John's (completed by 1243), and the Snetogorsky monastery (built in 1310 and stucco-painted in 1313).
[[File:Pskov ChurchStBasil Hill5c.jpg|thumb|Church of Saint Basil of Caesarea on the Hill ]]
Pskov is exceedingly rich in tiny, squat, picturesque churches, dating mainly from the 15th and the 16th centuries. There are many dozens of them, the most notable being St.&nbsp;Basil's on the Hill (1413), St.&nbsp;Kozma and Demian's near the Bridge (1463), St.&nbsp;George's from the Downhill (1494), Assumption from the Ferryside (1444, 1521), and St.&nbsp;Nicholas' from Usokha (1536). The 17th-century residential architecture is represented by merchant [[mansion]]s, such as the Salt House, the Pogankin Palace, and the Trubinsky mansion.

Among the sights in the vicinity of Pskov are [[Izborsk]], a seat of [[Rurik]]'s brother in the 9th century and one of the most formidable fortresses of medieval Russia; the [[Pskov Monastery of the Caves]], the oldest continually functioning monastery in Russia (founded in the mid-15th century) and a magnet for pilgrims from all over the country; the 16th-century [[Krypetsky Monastery]]; [[Yelizarov Convent]], which used to be a great cultural and literary center of medieval Russia; and [[Mikhaylovskoye Museum Reserve|Mikhaylovskoye]], a family home of [[Alexander Pushkin]] where he wrote some of the best known lines in the [[Russian language]]. The national poet of Russia is buried in the ancient cloister at the Holy Mountains nearby. Unfortunately, the area presently{{when|date=May 2024}} has only a minimal [[tourist]] [[infrastructure]], and the historic core of Pskov requires serious investments to realize its great tourist potential.

On 7 July 2019, the [[Churches of the Pskov School of Architecture]] was inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2005/|title=Six cultural sites added to UNESCO's World Heritage List|website=UNESCO|date=7 July 2019}}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:Pskov asv07-2018 Kremlin view from east img2.jpg|thumb|[[Pskova]] river in Pskov]]
=== Ecological situation ===
Vehicle emissions reach 83% of total emissions from stationary and mobile sources. The volume of emissions of atmospheric pollutants from stationary sources in 2007 amounted to 16.5 thousand tons, including 7.1 thousand tons (43.2%) of carbon monoxide and 2.6 thousand tons (15.8%) of solids. The largest source of air pollution in Pskov is Pskov Poultry Farm LLC (1365.92 tons of pollutants were emitted) and the Pskov Heating Networks SE (478.12 tons). All rivers flowing through the territory of the Pskov Oblast, including the city of Pskov, are characterized by increased concentrations of total [[iron]], copper ions, and hardly oxidizable organic compounds in the water.

The following indicators characterize air pollution in Pskov:
* annual average and maximum one-time concentration of sulfur dioxide – below 1 MPC
* the annual average concentration of nitrogen dioxide – 1.5 MPC; the maximum single concentration – 3.4 MPC
* annual average and maximum one-time concentration of carbon monoxide – below 1 MPC
* average annual concentration of suspended solids – below 1 MPC; the maximum single concentration – 2.2 MPC
* the degree of air pollution in general for Pskov is approximately low and is determined by the API value – 2.81<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pskov.ru/prelease/24.02.11/12123 |title=Доклад об экологической ситуации в Псковской области за 2009—2010 годы &#124; Портал государственных органов Псковской области |publisher=Pskov.ru |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=29 August 2023}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
The [[climate]] of Pskov is [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with maritime influences due to the city's relative proximity to the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Gulf of Finland]]; with relatively mild (for Russia) but still quite long winter and warm summer. Further west in Europe on the same latitude, winters are quite a bit milder and summer highs a bit cooler. Summer and fall have more precipitation than winter and spring.
