'''Maceió''' ({{IPA|pt|masejˈjɔ}}), formerly sometimes Anglicised as '''Maceio''', is the capital and the largest city of the coastal state of [[Alagoas]], [[Brazil]]. The name "Maceió" is an Indigenous term for a [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]].

Most maceiós flow to the sea, but some get trapped and form lakes ("lagoas", in Portuguese). There are numerous maceiós and lakes in this part of Brazil; because of this, the city was named Maceió, and the state, Alagoas. The new [[Zumbi dos Palmares International Airport]] connects Maceió with many Brazilian cities and also operates some international flights. The city is home to the [[Federal University of Alagoas]].

==Etymology==
The name "Maceió" has origin in the term ''tupi maçayó'' or ''maçaio-k'', that means "what it covers the swamp". The Aurélio Dictionary says that the term "maceió" means a temporary and cyclic lagoon that is located at the edge of the sea at the mouth of a watercourse small enough to be interrupted by a silicate bar until the high tide opens the way temporarily cyclically related to the season, river flow, lunar seasons, etc.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

Nineteenth-century shipping reports, which reported on ships bringing [[cotton]] from Maceió, spelt it as Macaio.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Liverpool Mercury]]|title=Brazil)|series=Imports|date= 26 Nov 1824|issue=705}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=[[Liverpool Mercury]]|title=Liverpool, Friday, November 26th|date= 26 Nov 1824|issue=705}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Vista de Maceió (AL).tif|thumb|left|Maceió in 1905]]
The city began in an old sugar mill and plantation complex around the 19th century. Its development started with the arrival of ships taking wood from Jaraguá bay.

With the installation of the sugar mills, Maceió started to export sugar, then tobacco, coconut, leather, and some spices. Prosperity made it possible for the settlement to become a village on December 5, 1815. Thanks to its continued growth, Maceió became the capital of the [[Alagoas]] state on December 9, 1839.

Maceió is also a port city and due to its port development about 200 years ago it changed from a village into a city.

==Geography==
The city is located between the [[Mundaú Lagoon]] and the Atlantic Ocean, with a tropical climate with average temperature of {{convert|25|°C|0|abbr=on}}. {{As of|2021}}, its metropolitan area had a total population of 1,354,973 inhabitants.

=== Climate ===
Maceió has a typical [[tropical climate]], specifically a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Am'', somewhat bordering on ''As''), with very warm to hot temperatures and high relative humidity all throughout the year. However, these conditions are relieved by a near absence of extreme temperatures and trade winds blowing from the ocean.

January is the warmest month, with mean maximum of {{convert|32|°C|1|abbr=on}} and minimum of {{convert|22|°C|1|abbr=on}} and more sun; July experiences the coolest temperatures, with mean maximum of {{convert|27|°C|1|abbr=on}} and minimum of {{convert|17|°C|1|abbr=on}} accompanied by higher humidity and much more rain.

The natural vegetation surrounding Maceió is [[tropical rainforest]]. Rainforests are characterized by high rainfall, with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between {{convert|2000|and|1700|mm|in m|0}}. The soil can be poor because high rainfall tends to leach out soluble nutrients.

==Economy==
One substantial local industry is based on chemical products from brine pumped from deep wells on the outskirts of Maceió. Another substantial industry is the production of ethanol and sugar from sugarcane grown in the region. In the last thirty years the tourist industry has transformed the coastal areas of the city into vibrant centers of entertainment for Brazilian and foreign tourists (Americans, Italians, French, Germans, Argentinians, etc.).

These coastal neighborhoods include [[coconut palm tree]]s, playgrounds, squares, open-to-the-public football, volleyball, and basketball fields, residential buildings, bars, nightclubs, tourist-oriented shops, restaurants, banks, hotels, and gambling houses (slot machines and bingo only, since casino games are illegal in [[Brazil]]).

The GDP for the city was R$23,400,000,000 ({{As of|2019|lc=on}});<ref name="panorama">{{cite book|url=https://cidades.ibge.gov.br/brasil/al/maceio/panorama |title=Maceió |website=cidades.ibge.gov.br |access-date=2022-04-11}}</ref> The per capita income for the city was R$22,976.51 ({{As of|2019|lc=on}}).<ref name="panorama"/>

Strong point in the municipality's economy is tourism. Maceió has a great potential to attract tourists due to its natural beauties and great cultural diversity. In addition, Maceió offers several leisure options and modern spaces for business, such as the new Cultural and Exhibition Center of Maceió, in the Jaraguá District. In September 2005, the new Zumbi dos Palmares International Airport, one of the most modern in Brazil, was inaugurated. The Jaraguá neighborhood was very popular during the end of the 1990s, with large investments by the Maceió prefecture. Nowadays, the Jaraguá is a commercial district, equipped with banks, museums, pubs and colleges. Nordeste Invest, an event of tourism and real estate investments of international scope, happened in Maceió in the editions of years 2006 and 2009.

===Festa Junina===
[[Festa Junina]] was introduced to Northeastern [[Brazil]] by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] for whom St John's day (also celebrated as [[Midsummer]] Day in several European countries), on June 24, is one of the oldest and most popular celebrations of the year. Differently from what happens on the European [[Midsummer]] Day, the festivities in Brazil do not take place during the [[summer solstice]] but during the southern hemisphere [[winter solstice]]. The festivities traditionally begin after June 12, on the eve of St Anthony's day, and last until the 29th, which is Saint Peter's day. During these fifteen days, there are [[bonfires]], [[fireworks]], and folk dancing in the streets (step names are in French, which shows the mutual influences between court life and peasant culture in the 17th, 18th, and 19th-century Europe). Typical refreshments and dishes are served. Like during Carnival, these festivities involve costumes-wearing (in this case, peasant costumes), dancing, heavy drinking, and visual spectacles (fireworks display and folk dancing). Like what happens on [[Midsummer]] and St John's Day in Europe, [[bonfires]] are a central part of these festivities in Brazil.

This is a typical Alagoas revelry that resulted from the union of Reisado (an Epiphany celebration), Auto dos Caboclinhos (Caboclinhos' Play), Chegança (public folk play depicting a naval battle) and Pastoril (outdoor folk play). Its choreography and costumes with colored ribbons and beads reproduce the cathedral's façades on the [[monument]]al hats covered with mirrors.

This is a [[drama]]tic dance motivated by the sea. It tells the sea adventures of the first navigators in its songs accompanied by guitar and ukulele.

Boi do Carnaval is a popular culture display derived from Bumba-Meu-Boi. It is always presented together with La Ursa (The Bear), Vaqueiro ([[Cowboy]]) and a percussion band whose rhythm captivates everyone that hears it.

Gogó da Ema was a famous [[palm tree]] with a crooked trunk roughly shaped like a curvilinear letter ''N''. The tree fell on July 27, 1955, at 2:20 in the afternoon.<ref>[http://www.coisasdemaceio.com.br/modules/myalbum/photo.php?lid=123 "Praça Gogó da Ema" ]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from ''Coisas de Maceió: O portal dos alagoanos'' (''Things from Maceió: The port of the Alagoans)'' (website) (in Portuguese). Retrieved 2008-02-05.</ref> It has become a symbol for Maceian culture and tourism, and there is a beach named after the celebrated tree. The tree also appears in folkloric art and music throughout northeastern Brazil.

==Main sights==

Maceió is home to numerous beaches, the color of sea varying from emerald green to blue; the water is always clear. The sand is white and there are many coconut plantations.

The Maceió sea has natural pools and reefs a few meters off the coast, that can be accessed by boat or raft sailings. The Mundaú lake is another option for sailing and bathing in transparent water.

Historical buildings include the Cathedral of Our Lady of Pleasures (1840),  the Deodoro Theatre, the Municipal Market, the Historical Institute Museum and the Floriano Peixoto Palace, seat of Alagoas State government.
