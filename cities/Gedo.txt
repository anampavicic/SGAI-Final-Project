'''Gedo''' ({{langx|so|Gedo}}, {{langx|ymm|Gethy}}, {{langx|ar|جيذو}}, {{langx|it|Ghedo}} or ''Ghedu'') is an administrative region (''[[States and regions of Somalia|gobol]]'') in [[Jubaland]], southern [[Somalia]]. Its regional capital is [[Garbahaarreey]]. The region was formed during 1974<ref name=Nordic7 /> and is bordered by the [[Ogaden]] in [[Ethiopia]], the [[North Eastern Province (Kenya)|North Eastern Province]] in [[Kenya]], and the Somali regions of [[Bakool]], [[Bay, Somalia|Bay]], [[Jubbada Dhexe]] (Middle Juba), and [[Jubbada Hoose]] (Lower Juba) further down east. The southern parts of Gedo, west of the [[Jubba River]], used to be part of the old British Trans-Juba region during half of the seventy years of [[Scramble for Africa|colonial era in Africa]] from 1890 to 1960. The [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Italy|Italian]]s fought twice over this area.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ceegaag.com/2013/04/05/gudoomiyaha-gobolka-gedo-xuseen-sh-cabdi-farey-oo-nasiib-daro-ku-tilmaamay-sida-uu-sharciga-u-garab-maray-raysalwasaare-saacid/| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190406222440/http://www.ceegaag.com/2013/04/05/gudoomiyaha-gobolka-gedo-xuseen-sh-cabdi-farey-oo-nasiib-daro-ku-tilmaamay-sida-uu-sharciga-u-garab-maray-raysalwasaare-saacid/| archive-date = 2019-04-06| title = Gudoomiyaha Gobolka Gedo Xuseen Sh.

The regional capital is [[Garbaharey]]. The [[Marehan]] (Darod) dominate economically, politically, and militarily, and rule across all districts. The Marehan in Gedo are split between the ''guri'' ('original inhabitants') and the ''galti'' ('new settlers').<ref name="CEWERU 2013, p.19">CEWERU 2013, p.19</ref> ''Guri-Galti'' conflicts over power and resources are common, especially in Luuq, Belet Hawo, and Baardhere.

President [[Siad Barre]]'s forces withdrew to Gedo following the collapse of the [[Somali Democratic Republic]] in the early 1990s.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Dool |first=Abdullahi |title=Failed States: When Governance Goes Wrong! |date=1998 |publisher=Horn Heritage Publications |isbn=0952524198 |pages=106–107}}</ref> After 1991, the [[Somali National Front]] (SNF) under Marehan [[Omar Haji Mohamed]] held large parts of the region for many years.<ref name="HajiSNF">{{cite web|author=Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada|author-link=Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada|url=https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6aba070.html|title=Somalia: Information on the Somali National Front in Gedo and on Omar Haji Masalle including his clan and subclan|date=1 December 1997}}</ref> In collaboration with the SNF,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Njoku |first=Raphael Chijioke |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RunEEAAAQBAJ |title=The History of Somalia |date=2013-02-20 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA |isbn=978-0-313-37858-4 |pages=142–143 |language=en}}</ref> Gedo joined the growing trend of [[Islamic Courts Union|Islamic Courts]] at the start of the [[Somali Civil War]] and local sharia courts succeeded in making [[Luuq District]] one of Somalia's safest areas for much of the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Elmi |first=Afyare Abdi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R52KQAAACAAJ |title=Understanding the Somalia Conflagration: Identity, Islam and Peacebuilding |date=2010-08-15 |publisher=Pluto Press |isbn=978-0-7453-2974-1 |pages=64 |language=en |quote=Parallel with this first court in Mogadishu, Sheikh Mohamed Haji Yusuf and Sheikh Mohamud A.

==Districts==
[[Image:gedodistricts.jpg|thumb]]
Gedo Region consists of seven districts:<ref name=CEWERU16 /><ref name=PIUGedo>{{cite web|title=UNSOM 2 Planning and Information Unit Regional Report: Gedo Region | work=Global Information Networks in Education (GINIE) | url=http://www.ginie.org/ginie-crises-links/peer/pdf/SomEd-6.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060922085146/http://www.ginie.org/ginie-crises-links/peer/pdf/SomEd-6.pdf|date=February 1994|archive-date=2006-09-22|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref name="Stados">[http://www.statoids.com/yso.html Districts of Somalia]</ref>

*[[El Wak District]]
*[[Bardhere District]]
*[[Balet Hawo District]]
*[[Doolow District]]
*[[Garbahaarreey District]]
*[[Luuq District]]
*[[Buurdhuubo District]]

The [[Dawa River|Dawa]] and [[Jubba River|Jubba]] rivers are the two major rivers of the region.

==Education==
The city of [[Garbahaarreey]] and the region's two ancient cities of [[Luuq]] and [[Bardera]] had education systems up to the secondary level. There were some technical schools in Bardera and Garbaharreey, albeit without a curriculum. They are connected through the [[Gedo Education Committee]]. All of Gedo region's high school graduates attended the [[Somali National University]] or affiliated institutions in [[Mogadishu]].{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

Since the civil war in Somalia, Gedo became one of half dozen regions which have restarted higher education institutions in the country. [[Bardera Polytechnic]], Gedo's first college, and the [[University of Gedo]], are both located in Bardera.

==Demographics==
According to a 1994 [[UNOSOM II]] estimate, the population of Gedo was about 590,000, the majority of the population being from the [[Marehan]] clan. Other estimates varied considerably; two reports by the United Nations Development Office for Somalia issued in the same year, 1995, gave very different estimates: 330,000 and about 1 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report of the Nordic fact-finding mission to the Gedo region in Somalia 15 October – 30 October 1998|access-date=21 August 2014|url = http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/3ae6a5bd0.pdf|page=8}}</ref>

The [[United Nations Development Programme]] estimated the total population in 2005 at 328,378;<ref name=CEWERU16>Conflict Dynamics International/CEWERU, [http://www.cdint.org/documents/Bottom_Up_Southern_Regions-Conflict-Assesement_CEWERU.pdf "From the Bottom Up: Southern Regions: Perspectives through Conflict Analysis and Key Political Actors' Mapping"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190714114721/http://www.cdint.org/documents/Bottom_Up_Southern_Regions-Conflict-Assesement_CEWERU.pdf |date=2019-07-14 }}, September 2013, p.16</ref> and UN estimates from 2014 stand at some 508,000.<ref name=SomPop14>"Somalia Population Statistics," accessed via https://data.humdata.org/dataset/somalia-population-data, March 2020.</ref>

==Economy==
The economy mostly depends on livestock and farming, but the Gedo region has strong interregional and international cross-border trade with Kenya and to some extent with Ethiopia. Trade across Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia allowed the Gedo region to be economically stable for the years before the UN intervention and afterward. The 1998 Nordic Fact Finding Mission prepared a report on the Gedo region and found some encouraging economic figures. [[Davidson College]] assistant professor [[Ken Menkhaus]] said that "Traders in Gedo region made more profit than, for instance, those in Hargeisa, in north-western Somalia."<ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain/opendocpdf.pdf?docid=3ae6a5bd0 Report of the Nordic fact-finding mission to the Gedo region in Somalia]</ref> Trade going through the border between the three countries was ongoing despite the raging civil war in Somalia for much of the 1990.

==Government==
Gedo region has a 32-member assembly body. The members are directly elected from the seven districts of the region with proportionality according to district population. The Gedo assembly or (Gollaha Gobalka Gedo) works with the federal government based in Mogadishu. Regional level posts include:{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

* Governor
* Vice Governor 
* Inter-Regional Affairs Director
* Director of Security Services
* Gedo Regional Police Commander
* Director of Education Services
* Director of Agricultural Agency
* Director of Economic Affairs
* Livestock and Forestry Dept. Director
* Director of Justice and Religious Affairs

After long conflicts in the region, the regional elders started a peace conference with initiatives from the then governor, [[Aden Ibrahim Aw Hirsi]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} This effort ended in success. and were followed by the elections of the regional assembly. The process was financed by UNDP.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

In addition to regional posts, the [[Federal Government of Somalia]] maintains military forces in the region. Brigade 9 of [[Division 60 (Somalia)]] was reported in the region as of 2016, originating from a U.S.-funded pilot programme that began in 2012.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Colin D.|last=Robinson |year=2019 |title=The Somali National Army: An Assessment [2016]|journal=Defense & Security Analysis |volume=35 |issue=2 |page=216|doi=10.1080/14751798.2019.1600805|s2cid=159442854 }}</ref>

==Cities and towns==
[[Bardera]] and [[Beled Haawo]] cities are the two principal cities of the Gedo region. In the recent past, [[Luuq]] or Lugh used to be the main political city of the Gedo Region, but the Somali Civil War made many of the city's residents to flee to other towns.

Bardera, the largest city and the seat of the most populous district in Gedo, has become urbanized to the extent that its population multiplied 400% since the breakdown of law and order in the capital of the country, Mogadishu. Aside from the urban population in proper Bardera, the rest of the region's population are [[Pastoralism|pastoralists]] with the exception of people living in the cities where the region's seven district seats are located. The town is home to [[Bardera Polytechnic]] as well as the [[University of Gedo]] which also has a campus at [[Beled Haawo]].
