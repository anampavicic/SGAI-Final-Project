'''{{lang|fr|Schaerbeek|italic=no}}''' ([[French language|French]], {{IPA|fr|skaʁbek, -bɛk|pron|Schaerbeek FR.wav}}; former [[History of Dutch orthography|Dutch spelling]]) or '''{{lang|nl|Schaarbeek|italic=no}}''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]], {{IPA|nl|ˈsxaːrbeːk|pron|Nl-Schaarbeek.ogg}}) is one of the [[List of municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region|19 municipalities]] of the [[Brussels|Brussels-Capital Region]], Belgium. Located in the north-eastern part of the region, it is bordered by the [[City of Brussels]], [[Etterbeek]], [[Evere]] and [[Saint-Josse-ten-Noode]]. In common with all of Brussels' municipalities, it is legally [[Multilingualism|bilingual]] (French–Dutch).

Schaerbeek has a multicultural identity stemming from its diverse population. {{As of|2022|1|1}}, the municipality had a population of 130,690 inhabitants.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=Schaerbeek {{!}} IBSA |url=https://ibsa.brussels/chiffres/chiffres-cles-par-commune/schaerbeek |access-date=2023-01-05 |website=ibsa.brussels}}</ref> The total area is {{convert|7.9|km2|abbr=on}}, which gives a [[population density]] of {{convert|16540|PD/km2|abbr=on}}, twice the average of Brussels.<ref name=":1" />

==Toponymy==

===Etymology===
The first mention of Schaerbeek's name was ''Scarenbecca'', recorded in a document from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cambrai|Bishop of Cambrai]] in 1120.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.schaerbeek.irisnet.be/plone/culture_loisir/histoire-et-patrimoine/schaerbeek-et-son-histoire/etymologie |title=Schaerbeek et son Histoire — Schaerbeek |archive-url=https://archive.today/20110718151359/http://www.schaerbeek.irisnet.be/plone/culture_loisir/histoire-et-patrimoine/schaerbeek-et-son-histoire/etymologie |archive-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The origin of the name may come from the [[Franconian languages|Franconian]] ([[Old Dutch]]) words {{lang|odt|schaer}} ("notch", "score") and {{lang|odt|beek}} ("creek", "[[Beck (stream)|beck]]").<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/Enquete-Communale-Final/d/19264207 |title=Enquete Communale – Final |publisher=Scribd.com |date=31 August 2009 |access-date=2012-02-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130025750/http://www.scribd.com/Enquete-Communale-Final/d/19264207 |archive-date=30 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Schaerbeek is nicknamed "the city of [[donkey]]s" ({{langx|fr|link=no|la cité des ânes}}, {{langx|nl|link=no|de ezelsgemeente}}). This name is reminiscent of times when people of Schaerbeek, who were cultivators of [[sour cherry|sour cherries]] primarily for [[Kriek lambic|Kriek]] production, would arrive at the [[Brussels]] marketplace with donkeys laden with sour cherries. Donkeys are still kept in [[Josaphat Park]], and sour cherry trees line the streets of the Diamant Quarter of Schaerbeek (the {{lang|fr|Avenue Milcamps|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Milcampslaan|italic=no}}, the {{lang|fr|Avenue Émile Max|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Émile Maxlaan|italic=no}}, and the {{lang|fr|Avenue Opale|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Opaallaan|italic=no}}). The {{lang|fr|Square des Griottiers|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Morelleboomsquare|italic=no}} is named after these trees.

==History==

===Antiquity and Middle Ages===
The period at which human activity started in Schaerbeek can be inferred from the [[Stone Age]] flint tools that were recovered in the [[Josaphat Park|Josaphat]] valley. Tombs and coins dating from the reign of [[Roman emperor|Roman Emperor]] [[Hadrian]] (2nd century AD) were also found near the old Roman roads that crossed Schaerbeek's territory.

The first mention of the town's name appears in a legal document dated 1120, whereby the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cambrai|Bishop of Cambrai]] granted the administration of the churches of ''Scarenbecca'' and ''Everna'' (today's neighbouring [[Evere]]) to the [[canon (priest)|canons]] of [[Soignies]], located in modern-day [[Hainaut Province|Hainaut]], Belgium. Politically, the town was part of the [[Duchy of Brabant]]. In 1301, [[John II, Duke of Brabant]], had the town administered by the [[schepen]] (aldermen) of Brussels. A new church dedicated to [[Servatius of Tongeren|Saint Servatius]] was built around that same time, at the same location as the old church.

At the end of the 14th century, the lands of Schaerbeek that belonged to the Lords of [[Kraainem]] were sold and reconverted into a hunting ground. The official entry of the visiting [[Dukes of Burgundy]] into Brussels, their second capital, was also through Schaerbeek, where they had to swear to uphold the city's privileges. The [[Game (hunting)|game]] reservation and the rural character of the village lasted until the end of the 18th century. The areas not covered by woods were used to cultivate vegetables and grow vines. In 1540, Schaerbeek counted 112 houses and 600 inhabitants.

===16th–19th centuries===
[[File:2 ème enceinte, Porte de Schaerbeek.JPG|left|thumb|The Schaerbeek Gate in 1612]]

Until the 16th century, the village had lived in relative peace. This would change in the middle of the 16th century as the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] set in. Schaerbeek suffered through ravages and destruction about a dozen times over the following two centuries, starting in the 1570s with [[William the Silent]]'s mercenary troops fighting the Catholic [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]]. Spanish, French, British, and [[Bavaria]]n troops all came through Schaerbeek, with the usual exactions and requisitions inflicted on the population.

After the [[French Revolution]], it was decreed that Schaerbeek would be taken away from Brussels and proclaimed an independent municipality, with its own mayor, schepen, and municipal assembly. On 27 September 1830, during the [[Belgian Revolution]], some fighting occurred in the Josaphat valley between the revolutionary troops and the retreating Dutch troops. In 1879, a more modern Church of St. Servatius was built near the old one, which was eventually demolished in 1905.<ref name=":0" /> The [[Schaerbeek Municipal Hall|Municipal Hall]] and [[Schaarbeek railway station|Schaerbeek railway station]] were built in 1887 and 1902, respectively. In 1889, the shooting range known as the ''[[Tir national]]'' was established.

At the end of the 19th and in the early 20th centuries, Schaerbeek became home to the gentry. The {{lang|fr|Avenue Louis Bertrand|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Louis Bertrandlaan|italic=no}} was laid out to herald a new, tree-filled residential district for the city's burgeoning [[middle class]]es, many of whom employed the period's best architects to design their new homes. [[Gustave Strauven]], {{Interlanguage link|Franz Hemelsoet|fr}} and {{Interlanguage link|Henri Jacobs|fr}} were just three of the architects who reinvented family houses, apartment buildings and educational buildings in the [[Art Nouveau in Brussels|Art Nouveau]] style.

===20th and 21st centuries===
[[File:Schaerbeek Place des Carabiniers 01.jpg|thumb|The {{lang|fr|Place des Carabiniers|italic=no}}/{{lang|fr|Karabiniersplein|italic=no}}]]

At the turn of the 20th century, Schaerbeek was a booming [[suburb]] which attracted a large [[middle-class]] population. In 1904, the newly landscaped [[Josaphat Park]] was inaugurated.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.1030.be/fr/culture-loisirs/histoire-tourisme-patrimoine/histoire-de-schaerbeek/schaerbeek-au-fil-du-temps|title=Schaerbeek au fil du temps {{!}} Schaerbeek|website=Schaerbeek 1030 Schaarbeek|language=fr|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref> One year later, the old St. Servatius' Church, the last witness to Schaerbeek's medieval past, was demolished.<ref name=":0" /> In 1915, the British nurse [[Edith Cavell]] was executed by an occupying German Army firing squad at the ''Tir national''. [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] came to visit the municipality at the close of [[World War II]]. Five years later, the population of Schaerbeek peaked at 125,000 inhabitants.<ref name=":0" />

====2016 terrorist attacks====
{{Main|2016 Brussels bombings|2016 stabbing of Brussels police officers}}

On the morning of 22 March 2016, three coordinated bombings occurred in Belgium in which the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) claimed responsibility. In these attacks, at least 31 victims and two [[suicide bombing|suicide bombers]] were killed, and 300 other people were injured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-brussels-airport-explosion-20160322-story.html|title=Another bomb found in Brussels after attacks kill at least 34; Islamic State claims responsibility|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=22 March 2016}}</ref> Hours after the attacks, police were pointed to a home in Schaerbeek by the taxi driver who drove the suspects to [[Brussels Airport]].<ref name=LawlerBoyle>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/12201611/Brussels-bombings-terrorist-attack-on-Belgium-airport-and-Metro-live.html|title=Brussels attacks: 34 killed and hundreds wounded as Islamic State claims responsibility for airport and Metro bombings&nbsp;– live|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=22 March 2016|access-date=22 March 2016|author=David Lawler|author2=Danny Boyle}}</ref> They raided the home and found a nail bomb, {{convert|15|kg|0|abbr=on}} of [[acetone peroxide]], [[hydrogen peroxide]], and an [[Black Standard#Jihadist black flag|ISIL flag]]{{Broken anchor|date=2024-08-03|bot=User:Cewbot/log/20201008/configuration|target_link=Black Standard#Jihadist black flag|reason= The anchor (Jihadist black flag) [[Special:Diff/1238301175|has been deleted]].}}.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.gva.be/cnt/dmf20160323_02198234/brusselse-broers-el-bakraoui-geidentificeerd-als-zelfmoordterroristen|title=Eén verdachte wordt momenteel ondervraagd|date=23 March 2016|publisher=Gazet van Antwerpen|access-date=23 March 2016}}</ref> Inside a [[waste container]] near the house, they also found a computer belonging to [[Ibrahim El Bakraoui]] who is believed to have carried out suicide bombings during the attacks along with his brother.<ref name=Jamieson1>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brussels-attacks/brussels-attacks-el-bakraoui-brothers-were-jailed-carjackings-shootout-n544241|title=Brussels Attacks: El Bakraoui Brothers Were Jailed for Carjackings, Shootout|work=NBC News|date=23 March 2016|access-date=23 March 2016|author=Alastair Jamieson|author2=Annick M'Kele}}</ref>

Nearly seven months later, on 5 October, three police officers were attacked by a man with a camping knife in Schaerbeek. Two of them suffered stab wounds, while the third was physically assaulted but otherwise uninjured. The assailant was then shot in the leg, subdued, and taken to hospital for medical treatment.<ref name="SamuelStabbing">{{cite news|last1=Samuel|first1=Henry|title=Two policemen injured in Brussels stabbing in suspected terror attack|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/05/two-policemen-injured-in-brussels-stabbing-in-jihadi-hotbed-dist/|access-date=5 October 2016|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=5 October 2016}}</ref> He was charged with attempted terrorism-related murder but the court did not see these charges proven.

==Districts==
There are two distinct parts of Schaerbeek; an eastern part and a western part. The eastern part (the area that includes the {{lang|fr|Square Vergote|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Vergoteplein|italic=no}}, the {{lang|fr|Boulevard Lambermont|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Lambermontlaan|italic=no}}, the Fleurs Quarter, the {{lang|fr|Place de Jamblinne de Meux|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|De Jamblinne de Meuxplein|italic=no}}, the Diamant Quarter and [[Josaphat Park]]) is an affluent area noted for its architecture and its convenient location (close to the [[Brussels and the European Union|EU institutions]] and the financial heart of the city, as well as [[NATO headquarters|NATO's headquarters]]).

The western part (the area near [[Brussels-North railway station]], the {{lang|fr|Chaussée de Haecht|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Haachtsesteenweg|italic=no}} and the Van Praet bridge) is home to Brussels' large [[Turks in Belgium|Belgian Turkish community]]. The area around [[Saint Mary's Royal Church|St. Mary's Royal Church]] is dubbed the "Little Anatolia" ({{langx|fr|la petite Anatolie|link=no}}, {{langx|nl|het Klein Anatolië|link=no}}) because of all the Turkish restaurants and shops on the Chaussée de Haecht.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schaerbeek.be/files/documents/culture_loisir/parcours-decouverte/parcours1.pdf|title=Promenades découvertes de Schaerbeek : Parcours 1: les abords de la place de la Reine|language=fr|access-date=2012-12-23}}</ref> The area is also home to a significant [[Moroccans in Belgium|Belgian Moroccan population]] and other [[Demographics of Belgium#Immigration|immigrant communities]] such as [[Spanish diaspora|Spanish]], [[Demographics of the Democratic Republic of the Congo#Congolese diaspora|Congolese]], and Asian immigrants. However, the district offers a social blend because of the numerous schools like the [[Hogeschool Sint-Lukas Brussel]], the municipal administrations and the proximity of the [[Rue Royale, Brussels|Rue Royale/Koningsstraat]].<ref name="Capadites" />

==Demographics==

===Foreign population===
Schaerbeek has a large concentration of immigrants from other countries, and their children, including many of [[Turks in Belgium|Turkish]] ancestry, a significant part of which originates from [[Afyon]] or [[Emirdağ]], Turkey.{{verify source|date=April 2020}}

Similar to Molenbeek, Schaerbeek has a large [[Islam in Belgium|Muslim]] population. {{As of|2016}}, the largest share of Muslims in Schaerbeek is of [[Moroccans in Belgium|Moroccan]] origin, but there are also significant communities of Turks and Albanians. That year, the mayor of Schaerbeek [[Bernard Clerfayt]] ([[DéFI]]) argued that the diversity in the foreign population means there is a lack of a [[ghetto]] effect, and [[Molenbeek-Saint-Jean|Molenbeek]]'s then-mayor [[Françoise Schepmans]] ([[Mouvement Réformateur|MR]]) stated that the foreign population in Schaerbeek was more diverse than that of Molenbeek.<ref name="Capadites">{{cite web|author=Capadites, Christina|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/molenbeek-and-schaerbeek-brussels-belgium-a-tale-of-two-terror-tragedies/|title=Molenbeek and Schaerbeek: A tale of two tragedies|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=2016-04-11|access-date=2016-09-12}}</ref> 22% of young people in Schaerbeek are [[Unemployment|unemployed]]. The municipality lies in a semi-circle of neighbourhoods in Brussels often referred to as the "poor croissant".<ref name="Capadites" />

{{As of|2023}}, taking into account the nationality of birth of the parents, 52.78% of Schaerbeek's population is of non-European origin (predominantly Moroccan and Turkish), 21.13% of European origin other than Belgian (mainly Bulgarian, Romanian, French, Spanish, and Polish), while 18.46% is solely of native Belgian ancestry.<ref name="Origin {{!}} Statbel">{{Cite web |title=Origin {{!}} Statbel |url=https://statbel.fgov.be/en/themes/population/structure-population/origin#figures |access-date=2023-07-04 |website=statbel.fgov.be}}</ref>
