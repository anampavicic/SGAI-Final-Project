The nearest airport is [[Tekirdağ Çorlu Airport|Tekirdağ-Çorlu Airport]] (TEQ). It is the most populated city in Turkey entirely in Europe.

==History==
[[Bronze Age]] relics have been found in various areas of [[Thrace]] including Çorlu and by 1000 BC the area was a [[Phrygia]]n-[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] colony. The area was subsequently controlled by the [[Greeks]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and [[Byzantine]]s.

During Roman and Byzantine times, the town was referred to as Tzouroulos,<ref name="Alexiad242">{{harvnb|Comnena|c. 1148|p=242}}</ref> or Syrallo.<ref name="TP">[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]</ref> The spelling "Zorolus" is used for the Latinised form of the name of the [[episcopal see]] identified with present-day Çorlu in the [[Catholic Church]]'s list of [[titular see]]s.<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 1013</ref> Some writers have identified the Roman town of [[Caenophrurium]] (the stronghold of the [[Caeni]] and the place where Emperor [[Aurelian]] was murdered in 275) with Çorlu, but this seems unlikely as the [[Antonine Itinerary]] lists Cenofrurium as two stages and 36 [[mile#Roman mile|Roman miles]] ({{val|53|u=kilometre}}<!-- 36 * 1479 m-->) closer to [[Byzantium]] than Tzirallum, and the [[Tabula Peutingeriana]] shows the locations separately.<ref name="TP" /><ref>{{Citation |title=Itineraria Antonini Augusti et Burdigalense |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S7noTOkuV0QC&pg=PA20 |page=33 |year=1990 | publisher=Vieweg+Teubner Verlag |editor-last=Otto Cuntz |isbn=9783519042730}}</ref> There were important Roman and Byzantine fortifications at Caenophrurium, which was a base for controlling large areas of Thrace.

=== Ottoman era onwards ===
Following a tumultuous early history, Çorlu was brought under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control by Sultan [[Murad I]], who immediately ordered the destruction of the Roman walls as part of a policy of opening up the town under the [[Pax Ottomana]]. In the Ottoman period, the town remained an important staging post on the road from Constantinople to Greece.

The nearby village of Uğraşdere was the site of the battle in which Sultan [[Beyazid II]] defeated his son [[Selim I]]  in August 1511; a year later Beyazid II was defeated by Selim, becoming the first Ottoman father to be overthrown by his son. [[Beyazid II]] died in Çorlu on his way to exile in [[Dimetoka]]. Coincidentally, [[Selim I|Selim]] himself died in Çorlu nine years into his reign. Both father and son are buried in Istanbul.

In the late 18th century, when the Ottoman Empire began to decline in both military and economic power, the city found itself at the crossroads of numerous conflicts. Turkish refugees were settled in the city when the Ottomans lost control of [[Crimea]] to the Russians. The grandchildren of these refugees met the Russians themselves when Çorlu was briefly occupied by Russian troops during [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-78|the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878]]. During the [[Balkan wars|Balkan Wars]] of 1912–1913, Çorlu served as the command post for the Ottoman army, but was taken by Bulgarian troops in December 1912.; it was recaptured by Turkish forces during the [[Second Balkan War]] in July 1913. Çorlu was then occupied by Greek troops from 1920 to 1922 during the [[Turkish War of Independence]], but was eventually ceded by Britain in accordance with the armistice of Mudanya.

The city became a part of the [[Republic of Turkey]] following its foundation in 1923. It continues to be an important garrison for the Turkish army as the home of the 189th Infantry Regiment. At the [[2013 Turkish local government reorganisation]] part of the district of Çorlu was detached to form the new district [[Ergene, Tekirdağ|Ergene]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=İl İdaresi ve Mülki Bölümler Şube Müdürlüğü İstatistikleri - İl ve İlçe Kuruluş Tarihleri |url=https://www.icisleri.gov.tr/kurumlar/icisleri.gov.tr/IcSite/illeridaresi/İstatistiki%20Bilgiler/İl%20İdaresi%20ve%20Mülki%20Bölümler/il%20ilce%20kurulus%20tarihleri_2019.pdf |access-date=28 September 2023|page=78 |language=tr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Law No. 6360|url=https://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2012/12/20121206-1.htm |date=6 December 2012 |work=[[Official Gazette of the Republic of Turkey|Official Gazette]]|language=tr}}</ref>

The city today is more populous than the provincial capital of [[Tekirdağ]], owing to a population spurt initially caused by the exodus of Turks from Bulgaria in 1989 who complemented the traditional left-leaning, industrial working-class of Çorlu; a second wave of migrants from rural [[Anatolia]] came to work in the factories in the 1990s and they now make up much of the conservative populace of the city. There are also small [[Romani people|Romani]] and Jewish communities.<ref>Avotaynu: the international review of Jewish genealogy, Volume 14, G. Mokotoff, 1998, [https://books.google.com/books?id=77RtAAAAMAAJ&q=Information+comes+from+the+Jewish+communities+of+Antakya+Bodrum+Bursa+Canakkale+Corlu+Edirne+Finike+Gelibolu+Iskendorun+Istanbul+Izmir+Kilis+Kirklarelli+Manisa+and+Tire+plus+a+few+scattered+stones+from+other+Gazi-Antep p. 40.]</ref> For a while the city also had a population of ethnic [[Albania]]ns and [[Bosnia]]ns flown in during the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9904/06/kosovo.refugees.01/ |title=More Kosovo refugees flown out of Macedonia |publisher=Cnn.com |access-date=20 November 2014}}</ref> as part of Turkey and [[North Macedonia]]'s efforts to aid the populations of former [[Yugoslavia]] by offering them temporary asylum.

The town centre consists of a mixture of traditional structures and modern concrete apartment blocks providing [[public housing]], as well as amenities such as basic shopping and [[fast-food]] restaurants, and essential infrastructure. However, there is little in the way of culture beyond cinemas and wedding-party venues. The road through the city center is often congested, as it isn't adequate for the needs of a city of a quarter million people. Local shopping facilities have recently been enhanced by the 25&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> Orion Mall. There is little to no nightlife but, since Çorlu is close to Istanbul, locals can and often do easily go to "the city" for the weekend.

Çorlu today is a typical Turkish [[boomtown]]. The population grew rapidly without proper infrastructure being developed to cope. The city center has remained almost the same size since the early 1990s when the population started to rise. The prison, the 5th Army Corps, a gas station etc. used to be outside the town before the "boom" but are not part of the city center. Since around year 2000, the eastern side of the city has been filling up with tower blocks which constitute a satellite area. Alongside ''Omurtak Boulevard'' on the east side, many facilities appeared (banks, restaurants, malls, police station etc.), creating a second "center" and reducing the need to travel to the actual center.

=== Attractions ===
Çorlu has very little to show for its past although the simple  Fatih Mosque does date back to 1453 and the Süleymaniye Mosque to 1521.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ÇORLU |url=http://www.turkeyfromtheinside.com/places-to-go/c/429-corlu-and-lueleburgaz.html |access-date=2022-09-30 |website=www.turkeyfromtheinside.com}}</ref> In 1970,<ref name="ycami">{{Cite web |title=Çorlu camileri |url=http://www.corlumuftulugu.gov.tr/yeni-camii.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208205927/http://www.corlumuftulugu.gov.tr/yeni-camii.html |archive-date=8 February 2013 |access-date=18 November 2012 |publisher=T.C.

==Economy==
With more than 300 factories{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}, Çorlu is a major textile-producing town, with [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]] and [[Mavi Jeans]] being among the companies that have factories here as well as large [[outlet center]]s intended to attract consumers from all over [[Thrace]] and Istanbul (Levi's closed its Çorlu factory in August 2014).

Çorlu also produces foodstuffs and soft drinks like Coca-Cola, and Unilever products like Algida ice-cream and Calvé condiments. As of 2009, Hewlett-Packard and Foxconn Group have formed a joint venture to build a large factory and production complex that will enable the two companies to use Çorlu, and Turkey in general, as the hub of their production activities for Eastern Europe and the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stargazete.com/ekonomi/ruya-gercek-oldu-hp-2-bin-kisiye-corlu-da-is-verecek-171153.htm |title= STAR - Haberler, Son Dakika, Haber, Son Dakika Haberleri|website=www.stargazete.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225191509/http://www.stargazete.com/ekonomi/ruya-gercek-oldu-hp-2-bin-kisiye-corlu-da-is-verecek-171153.htm |archive-date=February 25, 2009}}</ref>
