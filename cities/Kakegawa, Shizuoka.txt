==History==
The Kakegawa area has been regional commercial center within [[Tōtōmi Province]] since at least the [[Kamakura period]], but developed as a [[jōkamachi|castle town]] under the [[Imagawa clan]], whose headquarters was in neighboring [[Suruga Province]]. [[Kakegawa Castle]] was built by [[Asahina Yasuhiro]], a retainer of [[Imagawa Yoshitada]], in the [[Bunmei|Bunmei era]] (1469–1487). The castle later fell into the hands of the [[Tokugawa clan]], but was then given to [[Toyotomi clan]] retainer [[Yamauchi Kazutoyo]] in 1580. After the establishment of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], [[Kakegawa Domain]] was created, and ruled by numerous ''[[fudai]]'' [[daimyō]]. The area prospered during the [[Edo period]], as the [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō]] highway connecting [[Edo]] with [[Kyoto]] passed through Kakegawa, whose [[shukuba|post stations]] included [[Nissaka-shuku]] and [[Kakegawa-juku]]. Neighboring [[Yokosuka Domain]], a smaller ''[[fudai]]'' holding, was also located within what are now the city limits of Kakegawa.

After the [[Meiji Restoration]], Kakegawa was made part of the short-lived Hamamatsu Prefecture in 1871, which merged with Shizuoka Prefecture in 1876. Kakegawa Town was created in the cadastral reform of April, 1891, four years after the opening of [[Kakegawa Station]] on what later became the [[Tōkaidō Main Line]] railway. The town expanded steadily over the years, annexing neighboring villages and towns in [[Ogasa District, Shizuoka|Ogasa District]], and was elevated in status of that of a city in 1954.

On April 1, 2005, the towns of [[Daitō, Shizuoka|Daitō]] and [[Ōsuka, Shizuoka|Ōsuka]] (both from [[Ogasa District, Shizuoka|Ogasa District]]) were merged into Kakegawa.

==Government==
Kakegawa has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city legislature of 30 members.

==Economy==
Kakegawa has a mixed economy. It serves as a regional commercial center for west-central Shizuoka Prefecture. In the agricultural sector, production and processing of [[green tea]] predominates. The city is surrounded by [[green tea]] fields and is known for its high quality tea. Other crops include cantaloupe, tomatoes, strawberries and roses. In terms of industrial production, Kakegawa has several light industry industrial complexes. Major products include telecommunications equipment and electronics, cosmetics, automotive components and musical instruments.

==Education==
*[[Tokyo Women's Medical University]] - Kakegawa campus
*Kakegawa has 23 public elementary schools, and nine public middle schools operated by the city government and four public high schools operated by the Shizuoka Prefectural Board of Education. The prefecture also operates two special education schools for the handicapped. The city formerly hosted a [[Brazilian schools in Japan|Brazilian school]], a primary school called Centro Educacional Sorriso de Criança.<ref>"[https://web.archive.org/web/20080207160806/http://www.brasemb.or.jp/portugues/community/school.php Escolas Brasileiras Homologadas no Japão]" ([http://web.archive.org/web/20080207160806/http://www.brasemb.or.jp/portugues/community/school.php Archive]).
