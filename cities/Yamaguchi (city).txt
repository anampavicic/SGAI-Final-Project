==History==
The area of Yamaguchi was part of the ancient [[Suō Province]]. During the [[Muromachi period]] it was ruled by the [[Ōuchi clan]], who at their height ruled over six provinces in the [[Chugoku region]] of western Japan. The Ōuchi clan claimed descent from the royal house of [[Baekje]] and grew wealthy due to extensive trade with Korea and [[Ming Dynasty]] China. After the [[Onin War]], they welcomed intellectuals who escaped from [[Kyoto]], such that Yamaguchi prospered as a center of culture. Later in the Muromachi period, Christian missionaries from Spain and Portugal were welcomed, and the area became an early center for the ''[[Kirishitan]]'' faith. The Ōuchi were eventually overthrown by their vassals, the [[Mōri clan]], who ruled the area as part of [[Chōshū Domain]] during the [[Edo Period]].

Following the [[Meiji Restoration]], the town of Yamaguchi was established within [[Yoshiki District, Yamaguchi]] with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. On April 1, 1905 Yamaguchi annexed the village of Kami-unorei, followed by Shimo-unorei on July 1, 1915. On April 10, 1929: The town of Yamaguchi absorbed the village of Yoshiki to create the city of Yamaguchi.
Yamaguchi annexed the village of Miyano on April 1, 1941. On April 1, 1944, Yamaguchi annexed towns of Ogōri and Ajisu, and the villages of Hirakawa, Ōtoshi, Sue, Natajima, Aiofutajima, Kagawa and Sayama (all from Yoshiki District.)

The town of  [[Ajisu, Yamaguchi|Ajisu]] separated from Yamaguchi on November 23, 1947, followed by the town of [[Ogori, Yamaguchi|Ogōri]] on November 1, 1949. Yamaguchi annexed the town of Ōuchi on May 1, 1963  and the village of Suzenji on November 3, 1963. On October 1, 2005 Yamaguchi merged with town of [[Tokuji, Yamaguchi|Tokuji]] (from [[Saba District, Yamaguchi|Saba District]]), and the towns of [[Aio, Yamaguchi|Aio]], [[Ajisu, Yamaguchi|Ajisu]] and [[Ogōri, Yamaguchi|Ogōri]] (all from Yoshiki District);. Yoshiki District was dissolved as a result of this merger. On January 16, 2010 Yamaguchi absorbed the town of [[Atō, Yamaguchi|Atō]] (from [[Abu District, Yamaguchi|Abu District]]).

==Government==
Yamaguchi has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 35 members. Yamaguchi contributes six members to the Yamaguchi Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between the [[Yamaguchi 1st district]] and the [[Yamaguchi 3rd district]] in  [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Although Yamaguchi City is the prefectural capital, excluding public facilities and public works, the other major industries are commerce and the tourism and distribution industries. Despite having the second largest population in the prefecture after Shimonoseki, which is a constituent city of the Kanmon metropolitan area, and the third largest gross city product in the prefecture after Shūnan and Shimonoseki, the city has a very small industrial base.
