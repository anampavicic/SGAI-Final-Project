{{anchor|Etymology|Name|Toponymy}}

==Etymology==
The [[English language|English]] name Beirut is an early transcription of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name {{lang|ar-latn|Bayrūt}} ({{lang|ar|بيروت}}). The same name's transcription into [[French language|French]] is {{lang|fr|Beyrouth}}, which was sometimes used during [[French occupation of Lebanon|Lebanon's French mandate]]. The Arabic name derives from [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] ''bēʾrūt'' ({{lang|phn|𐤁𐤀{{rlm}}𐤓𐤕{{lrm}}}} {{lang|phn-Latn|bʾrt}}). This was a modification of the [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] and Phoenician word {{lang|phn-Latn|bīʾrōt}} later ''bēʾrūt'', meaning "[[water well|wells]]", in reference to the site's accessible [[water table]].<ref>''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'' (1993), ''Macropædia'', volume 14, 15th edition, Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., Chicago.</ref><ref name="LebEmbU.S.">[https://web.archive.org/web/20071015223704/http://lebanonembassyus.org/country_lebanon/history.html ''Profile of Lebanon: History''], on the former website of the Lebanese Embassy of the U.S.</ref> The name is first attested in the 14th{{nbsp}}century{{nbsp}}BC, when it was mentioned in three [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[cuneiform]]<ref name="LebEmbU.S."/> tablets of the [[Amarna letters]],<ref>EA 141-43.</ref> letters sent by [[Ammunira|King Ammunira]] of ''Biruta''<ref>[http://www.case.edu/univlib/preserve/Etana/encyl_biblica_l-p/philologus-pildash.pdf ''Phoenicia''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325132551/http://www.case.edu/univlib/preserve/Etana/encyl_biblica_l-p/philologus-pildash.pdf |date=25 March 2009 }}, in ''[[Encyclopaedia Biblica]]'', Case Western Reserve University.</ref> to {{nowrap|[[Amenhotep III]]}} or {{nowrap|[[Amenhotep IV]]}} of [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]].<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Phoenicia|volume=21|page=451|first=George Albert|last=Cooke}}</ref> ''Biruta'' was also mentioned in the Amarna letters from [[Rib-Hadda|King Rib-Hadda]] of [[Byblos]].<ref>E.g., EA 105, where he complains to the pharaoh that Beirut's king had stolen two of his merchants' ships.</ref>

The [[Ancient Greek geography|Greeks]] [[hellenised]] the name as {{lang|grc-Latn|Bērytós}} ({{langx|grc|Βηρυτός}}), which the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] [[latinization of names|latinised]] as {{lang|la|'''Berytus'''|italics=no}}.{{efn|The Roman name was taken in 1934 for the archaeological journal published by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at the [[American University of Beirut]].<ref>[http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/archaeology/berytus-back/berytus39/ ''Berytus Archeological Studies''] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023222512/http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/archaeology/berytus-back/berytus39 |date=23 October 2007}}, American University of Beirut (AUB).</ref>}} When it attained the status of a [[Colonia (Roman)|Roman colony]], it was notionally refounded and its official name was emended to {{lang|la|Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus}} to include its imperial sponsors.

At the time of the [[crusades]], the city was known in French as '''Barut''' or '''Baruth'''.

==History==
{{For timeline}}

The earliest settlement of Beirut was on an island in the Beirut River, but the channel that separated it from the banks silted up and the island ceased to be. Excavations in the downtown area have unearthed layers of Phoenician, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Crusader, [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] remains.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wwwlb.aub.edu.lb/~webpubof/research/21report/as/hist_projects.html |title=Research Projects – History and Archeology |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206033532/http://wwwlb.aub.edu.lb/~webpubof/research/21report/as/hist_projects.html |archive-date=6 December 2008 |work=American University of Beirut (AUB)}}</ref>

Several [[prehistoric]] archaeological sites have been discovered within the urban area of Beirut, revealing [[flint]] tools from sequential periods dating from the [[Middle Paleolithic|Middle Palaeolithic]] and [[Upper Paleolithic]] through the [[Neolithic]] to the [[Bronze Age]].

Beirut{{nbsp}}I (''Minet el-Hosn'') was listed as "the town of Beirut" ({{langx|fr|Beyrouth ville}}) by [[Louis Burkhalter]] and said to be on the beach near the Orient and Bassoul hotels on the [[Avenue des Français]] in central Beirut.<ref>Burkhalter, L., Bibliographie préhistorique (à suivre) (List of prehistoric sites, continuation and end), Bulletin du Musée de Beyrouth.

Beirut{{nbsp}}II (''Umm el-Khatib'') was suggested by Burkhalter to have been south of Tarik el Jedideh, where P.E. Gigues discovered a [[Copper Age]] flint industry at around {{convert|100|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The site had been built on and destroyed by 1948.<ref name="CopelandWescombe1965"/>

Beirut{{nbsp}}III (''Furn esh-Shebbak''), listed as {{lang|fr|Plateau Tabet}}, was suggested to have been located on the left bank of the [[Beirut River]]. Burkhalter suggested that it was west of the Damascus road, although this determination has been criticized by [[Lorraine Copeland]].<ref name="CopelandWescombe1965"/> P. E. Gigues discovered a series of [[Neolithic]] [[flint tools]] on the surface along with the remains of a structure suggested to be a [[hut circle]]. [[Auguste Bergy]] discussed polished [[axe]]s that were also found at this site, which has now completely disappeared as a result of construction and urbanization of the area.<ref name="Bergy">Bergy, Auguste. "La paléolithique ancien stratifié à Ras Beyrouth". ''Mélanges de l'Université Saint Joseph'', Volume 16, 5–6, 1932.</ref>

Beirut{{nbsp}}IV (''Furn esh-Shebbak'', river banks) was also on the left bank of the river and on either side of the road leading eastwards from the Furn esh Shebbak police station towards the river that marked the city limits. The area was covered in red [[sand]] that represented [[Quaternary]] [[river terrace]]s. The site was found by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Father Dillenseger and published by fellow Jesuits Godefroy Zumoffen,<ref name="Zumoffen1900"/> [[Raoul Describes]]<ref name="Describes1921">Describes, Raoul. "Quelques ateliers paléolithiques des environs de Beyrouth", ''Mélanges de l'Université Saint-Joseph'', Volume VII, 1921.</ref> and Auguste Bergy.<ref name="Bergy"/> Collections from the site were made by Bergy, Describes and another Jesuit, [[Paul Bovier-Lapierre]]. Many [[Middle Paleolithic]] flint tools were found on the surface and in side [[Gully|gullies]] that drain into the river. They included around 50 varied [[biface]]s accredited to the [[Acheulean|Acheulean period]], some with a [[Lustre (mineralogy)|lustrous sheen]], now held at the [[Museum of Lebanese Prehistory]]. [[Henri Fleisch]] also found an [[Emireh point]] amongst material from the site, which has now disappeared beneath buildings.

Beirut{{nbsp}}V (''Nahr Beirut'', [[Beirut River]]) was discovered by Dillenseger and said to be in an [[orchard]] of [[mulberry]] trees on the left bank of the river, near the [[river mouth]], and to be close to the railway station and bridge to [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]]. [[Levallois technique|Levallois flints]] and bones and similar surface material were found amongst [[breccia|brecciated deposits]].<ref>Karge, P., Rephaim : Die Vorgeschichtliche Kultur Palästinas und Phöniziens, Paderborn (First edition), 1917–1918</ref> The area has now been built on.<ref>Zumoffen, Godefroy., L'âge de la Pierre en Phénicie, L'Anthropologie, Volume 8, page 272, 1898.</ref>

Beirut{{nbsp}}VI (Patriarchate) was a site discovered while building on the property of the Lebanese Evangelical School for Girls in the Patriarchate area of Beirut. It was notable for the discovery of a finely styled [[Canaanean blade]] [[javelin]] suggested to date to the early or middle Neolithic periods of [[Byblos]] and which is held in the school library.<ref name="CopelandWescombe1965"/>

Beirut{{nbsp}}VII, the Rivoli Cinema and Byblos Cinema sites near the Bourj in the Rue el Arz area, are two sites discovered by Lorraine Copeland, [[Peter Wescombe]], and Marina Hayek in 1964 and examined by [[Diana Kirkbride]] and Roger Saidah. One site was behind the parking lot of the Byblos Cinema and showed collapsed walls, pits, floors, charcoal, pottery and flints. The other, overlooking a cliff west of the Rivoli Cinema, was composed of three layers resting on [[limestone]] bedrock. Fragments of blades and broad flakes were recovered from the first layer of black soil, above which some Bronze Age pottery was recovered in a layer of grey soil. Pieces of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] pottery and [[mosaic]]s were found in the upper layer.<ref name="CopelandWescombe1965"/> Middle Bronze Age tombs were found in this area, and the ancient [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] of Beirut is thought to be in the Bourj area.<ref>Lauffray, J., Forums et monuments de Béryte, BULLETIN DU MUSEE DE BEYROUTH.

===Phoenician period===
{{main|Phoenician port of Beirut}}
The [[Phoenician port of Beirut]] was located between Rue Foch and Rue Allenby on the north coast. The port or [[harbor|harbour]] was excavated and reported on several years ago and now lies buried under the city.<ref name="Jidejian1973">{{cite book |author=Nina Jidejian |title=Beirut through the ages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t29tAAAAMAAJ |year=1973 |publisher=Dar el-Machreq distribution: Librairie orientale}}</ref> Another suggested port or dry dock was claimed to have been discovered around {{convert|1|km|abbr=off}} to the west in 2011 by a team of Lebanese [[archaeologist]]s from the [[Directorate General of Antiquities]] of [[Lebanese University]]. Controversy arose on 26 June 2012 when authorization was given by Lebanese [[Minister of Culture]] [[Gaby Layoun]] for a private company called Venus Towers Real Estate Development Company to destroy the ruins (archaeological site BEY194) in the $500&nbsp;million construction project of three skyscrapers and a garden behind Hotel Monroe in downtown Beirut. Two later reports by an international committee of archaeologists appointed by Layoun, including Hanz Curver, and an expert report by Ralph Pederson, a member of the institute of Nautical Archaeology and now teaching in [[University of Marburg|Marburg]], Germany, dismissed the claims that the trenches were a port, on various criteria. The exact function of site BEY194 may never be known, and the issue raised heated emotions and led to increased coverage on the subject of Lebanese heritage in the press.<ref name="star2">{{cite journal |url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Local-News/2012/Jun-25/178036-phoenician-port-in-beirut-faces-mega-project.ashx#axzz1zwmIpaYS |title=Phoenician Port in Beirut faces Mega Project |journal=The Daily Star |access-date=25 August 2016 |archive-date=29 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929184610/http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Local-News/2012/Jun-25/178036-phoenician-port-in-beirut-faces-mega-project.ashx#axzz1zwmIpaYS |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Ralph K.

===Hellenistic period===
In 140{{nbsp}}BC, the Phoenician city was destroyed by [[Diodotus Tryphon]] during his conflict with [[Antiochus VII Sidetes]] for the throne of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] monarchy. Laodicea in Phoenicia was built upon the same site on a more conventional Hellenistic plan. Present-day Beirut overlies this ancient one, and little archaeology was carried out until after the [[Lebanese Civil War|civil war]] in 1991. The salvage excavations after 1993 have yielded new insights into the layout and history of this period of Beirut's history. Public architecture included several areas and buildings.<ref name="academia.edu">{{cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/238267 |title=The BCD Archaeology Project, 2000–2006 |last1=Curvers |last2=Stuart |date=2007 |journal=Bulletin d'Archéologie et d'Architecture Libanaises |volume=9 |pages=189–221 |access-date=6 February 2014 |archive-date=13 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211013165752/https://www.academia.edu/238267 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Mid-1st-century coins from Berytus bear the head of [[Tyche]], goddess of fortune;<ref name=GetzelCohen>{{citation |title=The Hellenistic Settlements in Syria, the Red Sea Basin, and North Africa |first=Getzel |last=Cohen |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-520-93102-2 |page=205 |quote=Berytos, being part of Phoenicia, was under Ptolemaic control until 200{{nbsp}}BC. After the battle of Panion, Phoenicia and southern Syria passed to the Seleucids. In the second century BC, Laodikeia issued both autonomous as well as quasi-autonomous coins. The autonomous bronze coins had a Tyche on the obverse. The reverse often had Poseidon or Astarte standing on the prow of a ship, the letters BH or ΛΑ and the monogram Φ, that is, the initials of Berytos/Laodikeia and Phoenicia, and, on a few coins, the Phoenician legend LL'DK' 'S BKN 'N or LL'DK' 'M BKN 'N, which has been read as "Of Laodikcia which is in Canaan" or "Of Laodikcia Mother in Canaan.'' The quasi-municipal coins{{mdash}}issued under Antiochos IV Epiphanes (175–164 BC) and continuing with Alexander I Balas (150–145 BC), Demetrios II Nikator (146–138 BC), and Alexander II Zabinas (128–123 BC){{mdash}}contained the king's head on the obverse, and on the reverse the name of the king in Greek, the city name in Phoenician (LL'DK' 'S BKN ’N or LL'DK’ 'M BKN 'N), the Greek letters ΛΑ, and the monogram Φ.

This symbol was later taken up by the early printer [[Aldus Manutius]] in 15th century [[Venice]]. After a state of civil war and decline the Seleucid Empire faced, King [[Tigranes the Great]] of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] conquered Beirut and placed it under effective Armenian control. However, after the [[Battle of Tigranocerta]], Armenia forever lost their holdings in Syria and Beirut was conquered by Roman general [[Pompey the Great|Pompey]].

Under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultan [[Selim I]] (1512–1520), the Ottomans conquered [[Syria]] including present-day [[Lebanon]]. Beirut was controlled by local [[Druze in Lebanon|Druze]] emirs throughout the Ottoman period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.druzeheritage.org/dhf/Druze_History.asp |title=Druze History |work=DHF Druze Heritage Foundation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201657/http://www.druzeheritage.org/dhf/Druze_History.asp |archive-date=3 March 2016}}</ref> One of them, [[Fakhr-al-Din II]], fortified it early in the 17th century, but the Ottomans reclaimed it in 1763.<ref name=EB1911/> With the help of [[Damascus]], Beirut successfully broke Acre's monopoly on Syrian maritime trade and for a few years supplanted it as the main trading center in the region. During the succeeding epoch of rebellion against Ottoman hegemony in Acre under [[Jezzar Pasha]] and [[Abdullah Pasha ibn Ali|Abdullah Pasha]], Beirut declined to a small town with a population of about 10,000 and was an object of contention between the Ottomans, the local Druze, and the [[Mamluk]]s.

By the second half of the nineteenth century, Beirut was developing close commercial and political ties with European imperial powers, particularly France.

Meanwhile, Ottoman power in the region continued to decline. Sectarian and religious conflicts, power vacuums, and changes in the political dynamics of the region culminated in the [[1860 Lebanon conflict]].

It also became a centre of [[missionary]] activity that spawned educational institutions such as the [[American University of Beirut]]. Provided with water from a British company and gas from a French one, silk exports to Europe came to dominate the local economy. After French engineers established a modern harbour in 1894 and a rail link across Lebanon to [[Damascus]] and [[Aleppo]] in 1907, much of the trade was carried by French ships to [[Marseille]]. French influence in the area soon exceeded that of any other European power. The 1911 ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' reported a population consisting of 36,000 Muslims, 77,000 Christians, 2,500 Jews, 400 Druze and 4,100 foreigners.<ref name=EB1911>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Beirut|volume=3|page=658|first1=Charles William|last1=Wilson|first2=David George|last2=Hogarth}}</ref> At the start of the 20th century, [[Salim Ali Salam]] was one of the most prominent figures in Beirut, holding numerous public positions including deputy from Beirut to the Ottoman parliament and President of the Municipality of Beirut.

A particularly destructive period was the 1978 Syrian siege of [[Achrafieh|Achrafiyeh]], the main Christian district of Beirut.

On 12 July 2006, the [[2006 Hezbollah cross-border raid|"Operation Truthful Promise"]] carried out by [[Hezbollah]] ended with 8 Israeli deaths and 6 injuries. In response, the IDF targeted Hezbollah's main media outlets. There were then artillery raids against targets in southern Lebanon, and the Israeli cabinet held Beirut responsible for the attacks. Then on 13 July 2006 [[Israel]] began implementing a naval and air blockade over Lebanon; during this blockade Israel bombed the runways at [[Beirut–Rafic Hariri International Airport|Beirut International Airport]] and the major Beirut-Damascus highway in Eastern Lebanon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/lebanon2.html |title=Background & Overview: Second Lebanon War {{!}} Jewish Virtual Library |website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org |access-date=14 November 2016 |archive-date=18 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218221252/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/lebanon2.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

In May 2008, after the government decided to disband Hezbollah's communications network (a decision it later rescinded), [[2008 conflict in Lebanon|violent clashes]] broke out briefly between government allies and opposition forces, before control of the city was handed over to the [[Lebanese Armed Forces|Lebanese Army]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tadamon.ca/post/category/independent-media/page/2 |title=Tadamon!

Beirut sits on a peninsula extending westward into the [[Mediterranean Sea]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite web |url=http://www.macalester.edu/geography/courses/geog261/efarhat/%20beirut/geography.htm |title=Beirut – The Pearl of the Middle East}}{{Dead link|date=October 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It is flanked by the [[Mount Lebanon|Lebanon Mountains]] and has taken on a triangular shape, largely influenced by its situation between and atop two hills: Al-[[Achrafieh|Ashrafieh]] and Al-Musaytibah. The Beirut Governorate occupies {{convert|18|km2|sqmi}}, and the city's [[metropolitan area]] {{convert|67|km2|sqmi}}.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> The coast is rather diverse, with rocky beaches, sandy shores and cliffs situated beside one another.

===Climate===
Beirut has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa'', bordering on ''As'', [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Csal'') characterized by mild days and nights, as its coastal location allows temperatures to be [[sea breeze|moderated by the sea]]. Autumn and spring are warm, but short. Winter is mild and rainy; [[frost]] has never been recorded. Summer is prolonged, hot and humid. The prevailing wind during the afternoon and evening is from the west (onshore, blowing in from the Mediterranean); at night it reverses to offshore, blowing from the land out to sea.

The average annual rainfall is {{convert|825|mm|in}}, with the large majority of it falling from October to April. Much of the autumn and spring rain falls in heavy downpours on a limited number of days, but in winter it is spread more evenly over many days. Summer receives very little rainfall, if any. Snow is rare, except in the mountainous eastern suburbs, where snowfall occurs due to the region's high altitudes. [[Hail]] (which can often be heavy) occurs a few times per year, mostly during winter.

===Environmental issues===
{{Main|Marine environmental issues in Lebanon}}

Lebanon, especially Beirut and its suburbs, suffered a massive garbage crisis, mainly from July 2015 up to March 2016. The issue began when authorities shut down the main landfill site originally used for Beirut's garbage south-east of the city and failed to provide any alternative solutions for months. As a result, garbage mounted in the streets in Greater Beirut and caused protests to erupt, which sometimes invoked police action. This problem was commonly blamed on the country's political situation. This garbage crisis birthed a movement called "[[2015–16 Lebanese protests|You Stink]]" which was directed at the country's politicians. In March 2016, the government came up with a so-called temporary solution to establish two new landfills East and South of the city to store the garbage, while several municipalities across the country, in an unprecedented move, began recycling and managing waste more efficiently, building waste-management facilities and relying on themselves rather than the central government. Moreover, Beirut has a lack of green areas with just two main public gardens (sanayeh and horch Beirut). In fact, concrete roofs cover 80% of the capital area.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/24/middleeast/lebanon-garbage-crisis-river/index.html |title=Lebanon: River of trash chokes Beirut suburb |last1=Hume |first1=Tim |last2=Tawfeeq |first2=Mohammed |work=CNN |access-date=14 November 2016 |archive-date=14 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114170326/http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/24/middleeast/lebanon-garbage-crisis-river/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Beirut Central District==
{{Main|Beirut Central District}}
The Beirut Central District (BCD) or ''Centre Ville'' is the name given to Beirut's historical and geographical core by "Solidere", the "vibrant financial, commercial, and administrative hub of the country".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cedarland.org/bcd.html |title=de beste bron van informatie over cedarland.

Its reconstruction constitutes one of the most ambitious contemporary urban developments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.solidere.com/solidere.html |title=Lebanese Company for the Reconstruction of Beirut Central District – Home |work=Solidere |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116054209/http://www.solidere.com/solidere.html |archive-date=16 January 2013 |access-date=18 December 2012}}</ref> Due to the devastation incurred on the city center from the [[Lebanese Civil War]], the Beirut Central District underwent a thorough reconstruction and development plan that gave it back its cultural and economic position in the region. Ever since, [[Beirut Central District]] has evolved into an integrated business and commercial environment and the focus of the financial activity in the region. That evolution was accompanied with the relocation of international organizations, reoccupation of civic and government buildings, expansion of financial activities, and establishment of regional headquarters and global firms in the city center.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.solidere.com/business/busover.html |title=Business in Beirut City Center |work=Solidere |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116054622/http://www.solidere.com/business/busover.html |archive-date=16 January 2013 |access-date=18 December 2012}}</ref>

Assessment of the demand for build-up space in the BCD has been done in reference to a number of macro-economic, demographic, and urban planning considerations at a time of marked need for new activity poles in the city, such as Souks, financial, cultural and recreational centers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lebanon.com/construction/beirut/anticipa.htm |title=Construction @ Lebanon.com – Beirut – BCD: Anticipated Phasing |work=Lebanon.com |access-date=18 December 2012 |archive-date=16 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116054511/http://www.lebanon.com/construction/beirut/anticipa.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> The district's total area is {{convert|4690000|m2|0|abbr=off}}, the majority of which is dedicated to residential space ({{convert|1924000|m2|0|abbr=off|disp=or}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lebanon.com/construction/beirut/program.htm |title=Construction @ Lebanon.com – Beirut – BCD: The Program |work=Lebanon.com |access-date=18 December 2012 |archive-date=16 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116054209/http://www.lebanon.com/construction/beirut/program.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Beirut Central District]] contains over 60 gardens, squares and open spaces. These spaces comprise landscaped streets, gardens, historical squares, pedestrian areas and sea promenades thus totaling to an area of {{convert|96|acres|0|abbr=on}} of open spaces.

The central district is Lebanon's prime location for shopping, entertainment, and dining. There are over 100 cafes, restaurants, pubs and nightclubs open in the [[Beirut Central District]], and over 350 retail outlets distributed along its streets and quarters. [[Beirut Souks]] alone are home to over 200 stores and a handful of restaurants and cafes. Beirut Souks are the [[Beirut Central District|Central District]]'s old [[medieval]] market, recently renovated along with the original Hellenistic street grid that characterized the old souks and the area's historical landmarks along long vaulted shopping alleys and arcades.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.solidere.com/beirut-souks/about/south-souks/ |title=South Souks {{!}} Beirut Souks – A new shopping experience |work=Solidere.com |access-date=18 December 2012 |archive-date=10 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610072528/http://www.solidere.com/beirut-souks/about/south-souks/ |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Solidere]], the company responsible for the reconstruction and renovation of the district, organizes music and entertainment events all throughout the year like the [[Beirut Marathon]], [[Fête de la Musique]], Beirut Jazz Festival.

However, the means of urban development in this particular area of the city was subject to much criticism and controversy. Rafic Hariri, who would later become prime minister, was the majority stakeholder of the company, which raises concerns of conflict of interest in the context of a public-private partnership.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://interventionsjournal.net/2014/07/03/rebuilding-beirut-from-ruin-to-simulacrum/ |title=Rebuilding Beirut: From Ruin to Simulacrum |last=Ryan |first=Amanda |work=Interventions Journal |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220145202/https://interventionsjournal.net/2014/07/03/rebuilding-beirut-from-ruin-to-simulacrum/ |archive-date=20 December 2016 |access-date=12 November 2016}}</ref> Many of the expropriations that have made the project possible have been made at undervalued land rates, and partly paid in company share.

It is for example forbidden to ride bikes on Zeituna Bay, a marina where many restaurants are located, and these laws are enforced by private security guards not national or municipal police.

The project was also criticized for destroying some of the city's architectural and cultural heritage. "Among the hundreds of destroyed buildings were "the last Ottoman and medieval remains in Beirut" wrote American University of Beirut professor Nabil Beyhum in the ''Journal The Beirut Review'' in 1992. Much of the damage had been done through unapproved demolitions in the 1980s and early 1990s, bringing down "some of the capital's most significant buildings and structures," wrote UCLA professor Saree Makdisi in the journal, Critical Inquiry, in 1997.".<ref name="beirutreport.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.beirutreport.com/2014/01/erasing-memory-in-downtown-beirut.html |title=Erasing memory in downtown Beirut |work=Beirut Report |first=Habib |last=Battah |date=19 January 2014 |access-date=13 December 2016 |archive-date=7 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207044937/http://www.beirutreport.com/2014/01/erasing-memory-in-downtown-beirut.html |url-status=dead}}</ref> Moreover, many of the traditional privately owned shops in the Beirut Downtown were replaced by luxury outlets and high-end restaurants that only few people could afford.

The actual success of the project has recently{{When|date=March 2017}} been in doubt, given that large quarters of the BCD are today empty, due to strong military presence, the Nejmeh Square where the parliament is located is most frequently completely deserted, and the businesses located there have mostly moved.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jan/22/beirut-lebanon-glitzy-downtown-redevelopment-gucci-prada |title=Is Beirut's glitzy downtown redevelopment all that it seems? |first=Oliver |last=Wainwright |date=22 January 2015 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=13 December 2016 |archive-date=29 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929073707/https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jan/22/beirut-lebanon-glitzy-downtown-redevelopment-gucci-prada |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Beirut Downtown.jpg|thumb|Cafés in downtown Beirut]]
Beirut's economy is service-oriented with the main growth sectors being banking and tourism.

In an area dominated by authoritarian or militarist regimes, the Lebanese capital was generally regarded as a haven of libertarianism, though a precarious one, as the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990) and subsequent conflicts significantly altered the political landscape.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} With its seaport and airport—coupled with Lebanon's free economic and foreign exchange system, solid gold-backed currency, banking-secrecy law, and favorable interest rates—Beirut became an established banking center for Arab wealth, much of which was invested in construction, commercial enterprise, and industry (mostly the manufacture of textiles and shoes, food processing, and printing).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/58884/Beirut/24957/Economic-and-political-conditions |title=Beirut – national capital, Lebanon |access-date=25 August 2016 |archive-date=10 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110222634/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/58884/Beirut/24957/Economic-and-political-conditions |url-status=live }}</ref> The economy of Beirut is diverse, including publishing, banking, trade and various industries. During that period, Beirut was the region's financial services center.

===Banking and finance===
[[File:West-Beirut1983.jpg|thumb|[[Ras Beirut]], 1983]]

The banking system is the backbone of the local economy with a balance sheet of $152&nbsp;billion at the end of 2012, nearing 3.5 times the GDP estimated at $43&nbsp;billion by the [[IMF]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Business/Lebanon/2013/Mar-05/208825-torbey-banks-will-maintain-profits-in-2013.ashx#axzz2OrXoEjbS |title=Torbey: Banks will maintain profits in 2013 |journal=The Daily Star |access-date=25 August 2016 |archive-date=15 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815232452/http://www.dailystar.com.lb//Business/Lebanon/2013/Mar-05/208825-torbey-banks-will-maintain-profits-in-2013.ashx#axzz2OrXoEjbS |url-status=dead}}</ref> Bank deposits also increased in 2012 by 8% to 125&nbsp;billion dollars, 82 percent of the sector's assets. "Banks are still attracting deposits because the interest rates offered are higher than the ones in Europe and the United States", says Marwan Mikhael, head of research at [[BLOM Bank]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.executive-magazine.com/banking-and-finance/banking-sector-lebanon-2012/5567 |title=Lebanon's banking sector still well-fueled |work=Executive Magazine |date=12 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004221853/http://www.executive-magazine.com/banking-and-finance/banking-sector-lebanon-2012/5567 |archive-date=4 October 2013 |access-date=25 August 2016}}</ref>

Beirut's foreign reserves were still close to an all-time high when they reached $32.5&nbsp;billion in 2011 and analysts say that the Central Bank can cover nearly 80 percent of the Lebanese currency in the market. This means that the Central Bank can easily cope with any unforeseen crisis in the future thanks to the massive foreign currency reserves.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Business/Lebanon/2012/Jan-06/159013-lebanons-foreign-currency-reserves-up-by-53-percent.ashx#axzz2OrXoEjbS |title=Lebanon's foreign currency reserves up by 5.3 percent |journal=The Daily Star |access-date=25 August 2016 |archive-date=15 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815234517/http://www.dailystar.com.lb//Business/Lebanon/2012/Jan-06/159013-lebanons-foreign-currency-reserves-up-by-53-percent.ashx#axzz2OrXoEjbS |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Lebanese banking system is endowed with several characteristics that promote the role of Beirut as a regional financial center, in terms of ensuring protection for foreign capital and earnings. The Lebanese currency is fully convertible and can be exchanged freely with any other currency. Moreover, no restrictions are put on the free flow of capital and earnings into and out of the Lebanese economy. The passing of the banking secrecy law on 3 September 1956, subjected all banks established in Lebanon as well as foreign banks' branches to the "secret of the profession". Both article 16 of law No. 282 dated 30 December 1993 and article 12 of decree No. 5451 dated 26 August 1994, offer exemptions from income tax on all interest and revenues earned on all types of accounts opened in Lebanese banks. On the first of April 1975, decree No. 29 established a free banking zone by granting the Lebanese government the right to exempt non-residents' deposits and liabilities in foreign currency from: the income tax on interest earned, the required reserves imposed by the Banque Du Liban by virtue of article 76 of the Code of Money and Credit, the premium of deposit guarantee imposed on bank deposits to the profit of the National Deposit Guarantee Institution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bdl.gov.lb/bfs/mainchr.htm |title=Main Characteristics of The Lebanese Banking & Financial Sectors |website=bdl.gov.lb |publisher=Banque du Liban |access-date=12 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605050024/http://www.bdl.gov.lb/bfs/mainchr.htm |archive-date=5 June 2013}}</ref>

===Tourism===
[[File:RockyRaouché.jpg|thumb|[[Raouché]]]]
The tourism industry in Beirut has been historically important to the local economy and remains to this day to be a major source of revenue for the city, and Lebanon in general. Before the [[Lebanese Civil War]], Beirut was widely regarded as the "[[Paris]] of the Middle East",<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qj-gMqGK1YUC&pg=PA3 |title=Out of the Middle East: The Emergence of an Arab Global Business |first=Kamal |last=Shair |date=14 October 2006 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-1-84511-271-4 |page=3 |access-date=14 November 2015 |archive-date=16 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240316002903/https://books.google.com/books?id=Qj-gMqGK1YUC&pg=PA3 |url-status=live }}</ref>  and also "[[Switzerland]] of the Middle East", often cited as a financial and business hub where visitors could experience the [[Levant]]ine Mediterranean culture. Beirut's diverse atmosphere and ancient history make it an important destination which is slowly rebuilding itself after continued turmoil.

According to the 2012 tourist statistics, 34% of the tourists in Beirut came from states within the [[Arab League]], 33% came from European countries (mainly France, Germany, and Britain), and 16% from the [[Americas]] (about half of which are from the United States).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lebanon-tourism.gov.lb/Publications/Statistics |title=WebHost4Life |access-date=25 August 2016 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304191610/http://www.lebanon-tourism.gov.lb/Publications/Statistics |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The largely pedestrianized [[Beirut Central District]] is the core of the Beirut tourism scene. The district is a cluster of stone-façade buildings lining arcaded streets and radial alleyways. The architecture of the area is a mix of French Architecture and [[Venetian Gothic architecture]] mixed with [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]] and [[Ottoman Architecture]]. The district contains numerous old mosques and crusader churches, as well as uncovered remnants and ruins of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] era. The District contains dozens of restaurants, cafes and pubs, as well as a wide range of shopping stores mainly in [[Beirut Souks]]. High-rise hotels and towers line the district's New Waterfront, marina and seaside promenade.

Another popular tourist destination in Beirut is the [[Corniche Beirut]], a {{convert|4.8|km|0|abbr=on}} pedestrian promenade that encircles the capital's seafront from the [[Saint George Bay]] in the north all the way to [[Avenue de Paris]] and [[Avenue General de Gaulle]] south of the city. The corniche reaches its maximum height [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] at [[Raouché]], a high-rise residential neighbourhood rising over a giant white limestone cliff and facing the recognisable off-shore Raouché Rocks.

[[Badaro]] is one of Beirut's most appealing neighborhoods, a lovely place to stroll during daytime and a destination for going out in the evening. Badaro is within Beirut's green district with a {{convert|75|acres|abbr=off|adj=mid}} public park (The Beirut Pine forest) and a {{convert|50|acres|abbr=off|adj=mid}} hippodrome. It is a neighborhood on a very human scale with small groceries around every corner. The neighborhood residents, a mix of old impoverished Christian bourgeoisie, bohemian style people in their 30s and well-established urban professionals, are loyal to local bakery and pastry shops. Because of the blossoming café and bar scene it has become lately a hip destination for Beirut's young and restless but old Beirutis remember that Badaro was already Beirut's version of the Village in the swinging sixties.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Groceries and eateries can be found on almost every street of the area.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} There are dozens of restaurants, pubs and footpath cafés of virtually every style.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Badaro "Village" thrives on local residents, day-trippers and hipsters from all over Beirut, office employees and many expatriates.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[Hamra Street]] is a long cobblestone street connecting the [[Beirut Central District]] with the coastal [[Raouche]] area. The street is a large concentration of shopping stores, boutiques, restaurants, banks, street vendors, footpath cafes, newspaper kiosks, and a booming nightlife spurred by students from the neighboring [[American University of Beirut]]. The AUB campus is another popular visitor destination, composed of a cluster of 19th century red-roofed buildings dispersed on a wooded hillside overlooking the [[Mediterranean]].

[[Rue Gouraud|Gemmayzeh]] is Beirut's artistic [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] quarter, full of narrow streets and historic buildings from the [[French Mandate of Lebanon|French era]]. It is located East of the [[Beirut Central District]], bordering the [[Saifi Village]]. The neighborhood is well known for its trendy bars and pubs, cafes, restaurants and lounges; most are directly located on [[Rue Gouraud]], the main thoroughfare that cuts through the middle of the district. [[Travel + Leisure]] magazine called Gemmayzeh "SoHo by the Sea," due to its colorful and chic cafés amid 1950s apartment buildings and hole-in-the-wall shops.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/back-in-action/2 |title=Beirut is Back |magazine=Travel + Leisure |access-date=25 August 2016 |archive-date=22 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221222151321/https://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/back-in-action/2 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, Gemmayzeh received the most damage by the Beirut explosion in 2020.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/beirut-explosions-lebanon-gemmayze-a9658681.html |title=Gemmayze, Beirut's beating heart, left in ruins by explosion |date=7 August 2020 |website=The Independent |access-date=25 February 2021 |language=en |archive-date=27 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211027191405/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/beirut-explosions-lebanon-gemmayze-a9658681.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Like other forms of tourism, medical tourism in Lebanon is on the rise recently. Although visitors from neighboring Arab nations make up the bulk of medical tourism patients here due to its proximity, Beirut is strongly trying to woo more Southern Europeans, Asians and North Americans to its land. Its Agency for Investment Development in Lebanon reports that growth in the medical tourism industry is growing by up to 30% a year since 2009. The country's tourism ministry is working closely with the medical sector and top-class hotels to create an organized, quality medical destination.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmedicaltourism.com/articles/destinations/lebanon/ |title=Destination |work=Allmedicaltourism.com |access-date=25 August 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072136/http://www.allmedicaltourism.com/articles/destinations/lebanon/ |archive-date=4 March 2016}}</ref> Major hotel and spa chains work with local clinics, travel agencies and the tourism ministry to create comprehensive healthcare and recuperation packages for foreign visitors. The government is highly involved in this industry and strives to make the process as easy as possible.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ttnworldwide.com/articles.aspx?ID=1357&artID=9634 |title=Spa Holidays Leading the way in medical tourism |work=ttnworldwide.com |access-date=25 August 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221225153/http://www.ttnworldwide.com/articles.aspx?ID=1357&artID=9634 |archive-date=21 February 2014}}</ref>
Cosmetic surgery is a major component of medical tourism in Lebanon. Most of the foreign patients come for routine operations like plastic surgery, dental or eye surgery, and Beirut's hospitals are also capable of performing specialized procedures such as internal bypass surgery and other technical treatments. Its top clinics and hospitals like Sahel General are equipped to handle the full range of surgical procedures. Beirut-based Clemenceau Medical Center (CMC), affiliated with Johns Hopkins International, was ranked one of the world's top ten best hospitals for medical tourism in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eecoy.com/content/cmc-among-worlds-top-10-best-hospitals-medical-tourism?page=4 |title=CMC Among World's Top 10 Best Hospitals For Medical Tourism |work=eecoy.com |access-date=25 August 2016 |archive-date=4 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104055927/http://eecoy.com/content/cmc-among-worlds-top-10-best-hospitals-medical-tourism?page=4 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

''Mimodactylus libanensis'' "mimo", the fossil of a pterodactyl, is featured in a special wing. This one-of-a-kind complete specimen in the Middle-East was found in Lebanon. It is promoted by means of state-of-the-art modern techniques: a hologram, an auto-stereoscopic movie, a full-scale reconstitution and a game "fly with mimo" – an entertainment that delights children and adults. Moreover, Mim hosts a thematic exhibition of 200 marine fossils. "Fish'n'Stone" was organised with the collaboration of Mémoire du Temps. Known throughout the world, those fossils were quarried in the Lebanese mountains. The history of the fossil formation is shown through an animation that submerses you in the marine life – a time capsule that takes you in a journey to some 100&nbsp;million of years ago.
