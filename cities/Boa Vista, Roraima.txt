'''Boa Vista''' ({{IPA|pt-BR|ˈbo(w)ɐ ˈvistɐ|lang}}, literally ''Good View''; figuratively "Fairview") is the capital of the Brazilian state of [[Roraima]]. Situated on the western bank of the [[Branco River]], the city lies {{convert|220|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Brazil's border with [[Venezuela]]. It is the only [[List of capitals of subdivisions of Brazil|Brazilian state capital]] located entirely north of the equator.

Boa Vista's population is 470,169 inhabitants (as of the IBGE 2024 estimation) and it is the most populous municipality in the state of Roraima;<ref>[http://www.v-brazil.com/tourism/roraima/boa-vista.html Boa Vista, capital city of Roraima, Brazil<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> more than half of the population of the state lives in the city. Commerce mostly occurs with [[Manaus]], the capital of the [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|State of Amazonas]]. Business also takes place between Boa Vista and with the cities of [[Lethem, Guyana|Lethem]], in Guyana and [[Santa Elena de Uairén]], in Venezuela. These two foreign cities are the only major cities that can be accessed from Boa Vista by road, although roads connect other smaller state municipalities with the capital city. Travel by airplane is the only means of transportation with other regions of the country.

As a modern city, Boa Vista stands out among the other capitals of the [[Northern Brazil|North Region]] of Brazil as it is a [[planned city]] with a radial plan. It was planned by the architect Darci Aleixo Derenusson who based his design for the city on one that is similar to that of Paris, France. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The city was built under the direction of Captain Ene Garcez, the first governor of Roraima.

==History==
{{More citations needed section|date=March 2013}}
[[File:Brasil Hoje n. 120 (1975) - Reportagem da Agência Nacional sobre a cidade de Boa Vista, Roraima.webm|left|thumb|Boa Vista, 1975. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil.]]]]
The municipality of Boa Vista formed the first urban area of the state of Roraima. The São Joaquim do Rio Branco Fort, founded in 1775, is located on the banks of the [[Uraricoera River]] about 32&nbsp;km from the capital and is considered to be of great importance to the region.

The city was created on July 9, 1890, as Boa Vista do Rio Branco. It was founded by [[Augusto Ximeno de Villeroy|Augusto Villeroy]] (Amazonas's Governor). The first mayor was [[João Capistrano da Silva Mota]], also known as Coronel Mota. After the mayor, two councillors ([[José Francisco Coelho]] and [[José Gonzaga de Souza Jr.|José Gonzaga de Souza Junior]]) were appointed.

In 1943, during the middle of World War II, Boa Vista became the capital of the recently created Federal Territory of [[Roraima|Rio Branco]]. The territory grew from mining operations in the area. The then Federal Territory of Rio Branco was elevated to statehood, later being renamed as "[[Roraima]]". Later, machine-based mining was prohibited (because of the resulting damage to the landscape), which ended up hindering the economy of the [[States of Brazil|state]] and the municipality.

In the 2010s, the [[Crisis in Venezuela (2012–present)|crisis in Venezuela]] led to the population swelling by around 50,000 Venezuelan immigrants.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/28/world/americas/venezuela-brazil-migrants.html|title = 'Their Country is Being Invaded': Exodus of Venezuelans Overwhelms Northern Brazil|newspaper = The New York Times|date = April 28, 2018|last1 = Londoño|first1 = Ernesto}}</ref>

===Festa Junina (Saint John Festival)===

[[Image:Orla de Boa Vista 5.JPG|right|thumb|Orla Taumanan Park]]
[[Festa Junina]] was introduced to Northeastern Brazil by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] for whom St John's day (also celebrated as [[Midsummer]] Day in European countries), on 24 June, is one of the oldest and most popular celebrations of the year. The festivities traditionally begin after 12 June, on the eve of St Anthony's day, and last until the 29th, which is Saint Peter's day. During these fifteen days, there are bonfires, fireworks, and folk dancing in the streets (step names are in French, which shows the mutual influences between court life and peasant culture in the 17th, 18th, and 19th-century Europe). Once exclusively a rural celebration, today, in Brazil, it is now largely a city festival.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

===The Civic Center===
[[Image:Garimpeiro.JPG|thumb|Praça dos Garimpeiros-Miners' monument.]]
The Civic Center, built in the form of an opened fan, starts from the banks of the Rio Branco. This design was created by the engineer [[Darci Aleixo Deregusson]] during Ene Garcez's government, the first of its kind in Roraima.

From the Civic Center runs a system of 16 avenues, with inspiration drawn from Paris, France, [[Belo Horizonte]], and [[Goiânia]], Brazil. In this square are the head offices of the Executive, Judicial and Legislative branches of the state government. Other buildings of significance are the Palace of Culture, the Amazônia Bank, the Ministry of Education, and a cathedral.

The civic center also has a monument to miners.

==Demography==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
Initially, indigenous people were the only inhabitants of Boa Vista. Boa Vista had the highest growth rate of any Brazilian capital in the 1970s, at 3% per year. Immigrants were attracted to this city due to employment opportunities generated by public service jobs for Brazilians. General commercial opportunities attract immigrants from neighboring countries.

In 1950 Boa Vista had about 5,200 inhabitants. This number grew 47-fold in only 56 years to approximately 250,000 inhabitants.

The population of the municipality in 2024 is estimated at 470,169 inhabitants by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), more than half of the population of [[Roraima]]. It is the largest city in the state and one of Brazil's most populous. The city grew more than 10% in just one year due mainly to Venezuelan immigration.

Ethnic groups found in Boa Vista include: [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindians]], [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]], [[Afro-Brazilian|Africans]], [[German Brazilian|Germans]], [[Venezuelans]], [[Guyana|Guyanese]] and [[Arab Brazilian|Lebanese]].

==Sports==
There are several professional [[association football|football]] clubs in Boa Vista:
*[[Atlético Roraima Clube|Atlético '''Roraima''' Clube]]
*[[Baré Esporte Clube|'''Baré''' Esporte Clube]]
*[[Grêmio Atlético Sampaio|'''G'''rêmio '''A'''tlético '''S'''ampaio]] ('''GAS''')
*[[São Raimundo Esporte Clube (RR)|'''São Raimundo''' Esporte Clube]]
*[[River Esporte Clube|'''River''' Esporte Clube]]
*[[Atlético Rio Negro Clube (RR)|Atlético '''Rio Negro''' Clube]]
*[[Náutico Futebol Clube|'''Náutico''' Futebol Clube]]

[[São Raimundo Esporte Clube (RR)|São Raimundo]] is the only club currently playing a national division, the [[2024 Campeonato Brasileiro Série D|Campeonato Brasileiro Série D]] (4th level on [[Brazilian football league system|Brazilian football pyramid]]).

The city's most important stadium is [[Estádio Flamarion Vasconcelos]], better known as ''Canarinho'', located in the neighborhood of the same name, Canarinho. The stadium, which located in the southern part of Boa Vista, has a maximum capacity of 10,000 people.

Also located in Boa Vista is the [[Estádio Raimundo Ribeiro de Souza]], better known as the ''Ribeirão'', which is located in a suburb of the city.

==Geography==
The city is situated on the western bank of the Branco River, and it lies 220 km from Brazil's border with Venezuela. It is the only Brazilian state capital located entirely north of the equator.

===Climate===
Boa Vista experiences a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Koppen]] ''Aw''), with a hot, humid wet season and a very warm dry season. Being the only major Brazilian city north of the equator, the wettest and driest months in Boa Vista are the reverse of the rest of the Amazonian region of Brazil, with a hot, humid, rainy period from April to November and a very warm, dry period from December to March. Temperature fluctuations are relatively small throughout the year.

The [[Maracá Ecological Station]] was established by presidential decree on 2 June 1981. The station consists of the island of Maracá between the Santa Rosa and Maracá branches of the [[Uraricoera River]] in the municipality of Boa Vista, and has an area of {{convert|101312|ha}}.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto/1980-1989/D86061.htm |author=Presidência da República|date=2 June 1981 |title=DECRETO Nº 86.061, DE 2 DE JUNHO DE 1981.
