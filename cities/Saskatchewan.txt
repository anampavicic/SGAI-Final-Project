Saskatchewan has been inhabited for thousands of years by [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|indigenous peoples]]. Europeans first explored the area in 1690 and first settled in the area in 1774. It became a province in 1905, carved out from the vast [[History of the Northwest Territories|North-West Territories]], which had until then included most of the [[Canadian Prairies]]. In the early 20th century, the province became known as a stronghold for Canadian social democracy; North America's [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation|first social-democratic government]] was [[1944 Saskatchewan general election|elected in 1944]]. The province's economy is based on [[agriculture]], [[mining]], and [[Energy industry|energy]].

Saskatchewan is presently governed by Premier [[Scott Moe]], the leader of the [[Saskatchewan Party]], which has been in power since 2007.

In 1992, the federal and provincial governments signed a historic land claim agreement with [[First Nations in Saskatchewan]].<ref name="aadnc-aandc1" /> The First Nations received compensation which they could use to buy land on the open market for the bands. They have acquired about {{cvt|3079|km2|acre mi2}}, new reserve lands under this process. Some First Nations have used their settlement to invest in urban areas, including Regina and Saskatoon.<ref name="aadnc-aandc1">[http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1312988304164 "Treaty Land Entitlement&nbsp;– The English River Story, Saskatchewan"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714032629/http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1312988304164 |date=July 14, 2012 }}, Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, accessed November 25, 2011</ref>

{{Main|Geography of Saskatchewan}}
{{See also|List of regions of Saskatchewan}}
[[File:Saskatchewan Topographic.png|thumb|A topographic map of Saskatchewan, showing cities, towns, rural municipality borders, and natural features.]]
Saskatchewan is the only province without a [[natural border]]. As its borders follow geographic lines of [[longitude]] and [[latitude]], the province is roughly a [[quadrilateral]], or a shape with four sides. However, the southern border on the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]] and the northern border on the [[60th parallel north|60th parallel]] curve to the left as one proceeds east, as do all parallels in the Northern Hemisphere. Additionally, the eastern boundary of the province follows range lines and [[correction line]]s of the [[Dominion Land Survey]], laid out by surveyors prior to the ''[[Dominion Lands Act]]'' [[Homestead principle|homestead]] program (1880–1928).

Saskatchewan is part of the western provinces and is bounded on the west by [[Alberta]], on the north by the [[Northwest Territories]], on the north-east by [[Nunavut]], on the east by [[Manitoba]], and on the south by the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Montana]] and [[North Dakota]]. Saskatchewan has the distinction of being the only Canadian province for which no borders correspond to physical geographic features (i.e. they are all parallels and meridians). Along with Alberta, Saskatchewan is one of only two [[land-locked]] provinces.

The overwhelming majority of Saskatchewan's population is in the southern third of the province, south of the [[53rd parallel north|53rd parallel]].

Saskatchewan contains two major natural regions: the [[Boreal Forest of Canada|boreal forest]] in the north and the [[prairie]]s in the south. They are separated by an [[aspen parkland]] transition zone near the [[North Saskatchewan River]] on the western side of the province, and near to south of the [[Saskatchewan River]] on the eastern side. Northern Saskatchewan is mostly covered by forest except for the [[Lake Athabasca Sand Dunes]], the largest active sand dunes in the world north of 58°, and adjacent to the southern shore of [[Lake Athabasca]]. Southern Saskatchewan contains another area with sand dunes known as the "Great Sand Hills" covering over {{cvt|300|km2}}. The [[Cypress Hills (Canada)|Cypress Hills]], in the southwestern corner of Saskatchewan and Killdeer Badlands ([[Grasslands National Park]]), are areas of the province that were unglaciated during the last glaciation period, the [[Wisconsin glaciation]].

The province's highest point, at {{cvt|1392|m}}, is in the [[Cypress Hills (Canada)|Cypress Hills]] less than {{cvt|2|km}} from the provincial boundary with Alberta.<ref>{{cite web|title=Saskatchewan High Point|url=http://peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=6140|website=peakbagger|publisher=Peakbagger.com|access-date=August 17, 2014|archive-date=June 10, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210610084752/https://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=6140|url-status=live}}</ref> The lowest point is the shore of [[Lake Athabasca]], at {{cvt|213|m}}. The province has 14 major [[drainage basin]]s made up of various rivers and watersheds draining into the [[Arctic Ocean]], [[Hudson Bay]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080315170748/http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/hydrology.html Hydrology] from The Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan</ref>

=== Climate ===
[[File:Saskatchewan Köppen.svg|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] of Saskatchewan]]
Saskatchewan receives more hours of [[sunshine]] than any other Canadian province.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Climate Data|url=http://climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/winners/provincedata_categories_e.html?SelectedCategory=40|website=climate.weather.gc|publisher=Environment Canada|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119055015/http://climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/winners/provincedata_categories_e.html?SelectedCategory=40|archive-date=January 19, 2012|access-date=July 17, 2011}}</ref> The province lies far from any significant body of water. This fact, combined with its northerly latitude, gives it a warm summer, corresponding to its [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen type ''Dfb'']]) in the central and most of the eastern parts of the province, as well as the [[Cypress Hills (Canada)|Cypress Hills]]; drying off to a [[semi-arid]] steppe climate (Köppen type ''BSk'') in the southwestern part of the province. Drought can affect agricultural areas during long periods with little or no precipitation at all. The northern parts of Saskatchewan – from about [[La Ronge]] northward – have a [[subarctic climate]] (Köppen ''Dfc'') with a shorter summer season. Summers can get very hot, sometimes above {{cvt|38|C}} during the day, and with humidity decreasing from northeast to southwest. Warm southern winds blow from the plains and intermontane regions of the Western United States during much of July and August, very cool or hot but changeable air masses often occur during spring and in September. Winters are usually bitterly cold, with frequent Arctic air descending from the north,<ref>{{cite web|title=2008/12/23, Four PM|url=http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/02/06/2008-12-23 |last=Bray |first=Tim|date=December 23, 2008|website=tbray|access-date=February 28, 2008|quote=English just doesn't have words to describe cold of that intensity.

Warm [[chinook winds]] often blow from the west, bringing periods of mild weather. Annual precipitation averages 30 to 45 centimetres (12 to 18&nbsp;inches) across the province, with the bulk of rain falling in June, July, and August.<ref>{{cite web|title=Average Weather for Saskatoon, SK – Temperature and Precipitation|url=http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/businesstraveler/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/CAXX0442?from=search |date=July 29, 2010|website=Weather|publisher=Weather.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014184756/http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/businesstraveler/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/CAXX0442?from=search |archive-date=October 14, 2007|access-date=February 23, 2011}}</ref>

Saskatchewan is one of the most [[tornado]]-active parts of [[Canada]], averaging roughly 12 to 18 tornadoes per year, some violent. In 2012, 33 tornadoes were reported in the province. The [[Regina Cyclone]] took place in June 1912 when 28 people died in an F4 [[Fujita scale]] tornado. Severe and non-severe thunderstorm events occur in Saskatchewan, usually from early spring to late summer. Hail, strong winds and isolated tornadoes are a common occurrence.

The hottest temperature ever recorded in Saskatchewan was in July 1937 when the temperature rose to {{cvt|45|C}} in [[Midale]] and [[Yellow Grass]]. The coldest ever recorded in the province was {{cvt|−56.7|C}} in [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]], north of Saskatoon, in February 1893.

Saskatchewan has been populated by various [[indigenous peoples of North America]], including members of the [[Sarcee people|Sarcee]], [[Niitsitapi]], [[Gros Ventre people|Atsina]], [[Cree]], [[Saulteaux]], [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]] (Nakoda), and [[Sioux]].

The first known European to enter Saskatchewan was [[Henry Kelsey]] from England in 1690, who travelled up the Saskatchewan River in hopes of trading fur with the region's indigenous peoples. [[Fort La Jonquière]] and [[Fort de la Corne]] were first established in 1751 and 1753 by early French explorers and traders. The first permanent European settlement was a [[Hudson's Bay Company]] post at [[Cumberland House, Saskatchewan|Cumberland House]], founded in 1774 by [[Samuel Hearne]].<ref>{{Cite journal |pmc = 2094753|year = 2000|last1 = Houston|first1 = C.

=== 19th century ===
In 1803, the [[Louisiana Purchase]] transferred from France to the United States part of what is now [[Alberta]] and Saskatchewan. In 1818, the U.S. ceded the area to Britain. Most of what is now Saskatchewan was part of [[Rupert's Land]] and controlled by the Hudson's Bay Company, which claimed rights to all watersheds flowing into [[Hudson Bay]], including the [[Saskatchewan River]], [[Churchill River (Hudson Bay)|Churchill]], [[Assiniboine River|Assiniboine]], [[Souris River|Souris]], and [[Qu'Appelle River]] systems.

In the late 1850s and early 1860s, scientific expeditions led by [[John Palliser]] and [[Henry Youle Hind]] explored the prairie region of the province.

In 1870, Canada acquired the Hudson's Bay Company's territories and formed the [[North-West Territories]] to administer the vast territory between [[British Columbia]] and [[Manitoba]]. The Crown also entered into a series of [[Numbered Treaties|numbered treaties]] with the indigenous peoples of the area, which serve as the basis of the relationship between [[First Nations in Canada|First Nations]], as they are called today, and the Crown. Since the late twentieth century, land losses and inequities as a result of those treaties have been subject to negotiation for settlement between the [[First Nations in Saskatchewan]] and the federal government, in collaboration with provincial governments.

In 1876, following their defeat of United States Army forces at the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]] in [[Montana Territory]] in the United States, the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] Chief [[Sitting Bull]] led several thousand of his people to [[Wood Mountain, Saskatchewan|Wood Mountain]]. Survivors and descendants founded Wood Mountain Reserve in 1914.

The North-West Mounted Police set up several posts and forts across Saskatchewan, including [[Fort Walsh]] in the Cypress Hills, and [[Wood Mountain Regional Park|Wood Mountain]] Post in south-central Saskatchewan near the United States border.

Many [[Métis (people)|Métis]] people, who had not been signatories to a treaty, had moved to the [[Southbranch Settlement]] and [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]] district north of present-day Saskatoon following the [[Red River Rebellion]] in Manitoba in 1870. In the early 1880s, the Canadian government refused to hear the Métis' grievances, which stemmed from land-use issues. Finally, in 1885, the Métis, led by [[Louis Riel]], staged the [[North-West Rebellion]] and declared a provisional government. They were defeated by a Canadian militia brought to the [[Canadian prairies]] by the new Canadian Pacific Railway. Riel, who surrendered and was convicted of treason in a packed Regina courtroom, was hanged on November 16, 1885. Since then, the government has recognized the Métis as an aboriginal people with status rights and provided them with various benefits.

==== European settlements ====
The national policy set by the federal government, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and associated land companies encouraged immigration. The ''[[Dominion Lands Act]]'' of 1872 permitted settlers to acquire one-quarter of a square mile of land to homestead and offered an additional quarter upon establishing a homestead. In 1874, the North-West Mounted Police began providing police services. In 1876, the ''North-West Territories Act'' provided for appointment, by the Ottawa, of a Lieutenant Governor and a Council to assist him.<ref>{{cite book|author=Howard A.

[[File:Ad to attract Immigrants to wheat belt in 1898.jpg|thumb|An ad to attract immigrants to [[Western Canada]], 1898]]
Highly optimistic advertising campaigns promoted the benefits of prairie living. Potential immigrants read leaflets that described Canada as a favourable place to live and downplayed the need for agricultural expertise. Ads in ''The Nor'-West Farmer'' by the Commissioner of Immigration implied that western land held water, wood, gold, silver, iron, copper, and cheap coal for fuel, all of which were readily at hand. The reality was far harsher, especially for the first arrivals who lived in [[sod house]]s. However eastern money poured in and by 1913, long term mortgage loans to Saskatchewan farmers had reached $65 million.<ref>Sandra Rollings-Magnusson, "Canada's Most Wanted: Pioneer Women on the Western Prairies." ''Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology'' 2000 37(2): 223–238; W. T. Easterbrook, ''Farm Credit in Canada'' 1938.</ref>

The dominant groups comprised British settlers from eastern Canada and Britain, who comprised about half of the population during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They played the leading role in establishing the basic institutions of plains society, economy and government.<ref>Peter Bush, ''Western Challenge: The Presbyterian Church in Canada's Mission on the Prairies and North, 1885–1925.''

=== 20th century ===
Gender roles were sharply defined. Men were primarily responsible for breaking the land; planting and harvesting; building the house; buying, operating and repairing machinery; and handling finances. At first, there were many single men on the prairie, or husbands whose wives were still back east, but they had a hard time. They realized the need for a wife. In 1901, there were 19,200 families, but this surged to 150,300 families only 15 years later. Wives played a central role in settlement of the prairie region. Their labour, skills, and ability to adapt to the harsh environment proved decisive in meeting the challenges. They prepared bannock, beans and bacon, mended clothes, raised children, cleaned, tended the garden, helped at harvest time and nursed everyone back to health. While prevailing patriarchal attitudes, legislation, and economic principles obscured women's contributions, the flexibility exhibited by farm women in performing productive and nonproductive labour was critical to the survival of family farms, and thus to the success of the wheat economy.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rollings-Magnusson | first1 = Sandra | year = 2000 | title = Canada's Most Wanted: Pioneer Women on the Western Prairies | journal = Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 223–238 | doi = 10.1111/j.1755-618X.2000.tb01265.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rowles | first1 = E. | year = 1952 | title = Bannock, beans and bacon: An investigation of pioneer diet | journal = Saskatchewan History | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 1–16 }}</ref>
[[File:Banquet celebrating new province of Saskatchewan.jpg|thumb|A banquet being held to commemorate the creation of Saskatchewan, 1905]]
On September 1, 1905, Saskatchewan became a province, with inauguration day held on September 4. Its political leaders at the time proclaimed its destiny was to become Canada's most powerful province. Saskatchewan embarked on an ambitious province-building program based on its Anglo-Canadian culture and wheat production for the export market. Population quintupled from 91,000 in 1901 to 492,000 in 1911, thanks to heavy immigration of farmers from Ukraine, U.S., Germany and Scandinavia. Efforts were made to assimilate the newcomers to British Canadian culture and values.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pitsula | first1 = James M. | year = 2005 | title = Disparate Duo | journal = Beaver | volume = 85 | issue = 4| pages = 14–24 }}</ref>

In the 1905 provincial elections, Liberals won 16 of 25 seats in Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan government bought out Bell Telephone Company in 1909, with the government owning the long-distance lines and left local service to small companies organized at the municipal level.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Love | first1 = Ronald S. | year = 2005 | title = 'A Harebrained Plan': Saskatchewan and the Formation of a Provincial Telephone Policy, 1906–1912 | journal = Saskatchewan History | volume = 57 | issue = 1| pages = 15–33 }}</ref> Premier Walter Scott preferred government assistance to outright ownership because he thought enterprises worked better if citizens had a stake in running them; he set up the Saskatchewan Cooperative Elevator Company in 1911. Despite pressure from farm groups for direct government involvement in the grain handling business, the Scott government opted to loan money to a farmer-owned elevator company. Saskatchewan in 1909 provided bond guarantees to railway companies for the construction of branch lines, alleviating the concerns of farmers who had trouble getting their wheat to market by waggon.<ref>Kevin H. Burley, ''The Development of Canada's Staples 1867–1939: A Documentary Collection'' (1970) pp 139–43.</ref> The [[Saskatchewan Grain Growers Association]], was the dominant political force in the province until the 1920s; it had close ties with the governing Liberal party. In 1913, the Saskatchewan Stock Growers Association was established with three goals: to watch over legislation; to forward the interests of the stock growers in every honourable and legitimate way; and to suggest to parliament legislation to meet changing conditions and requirements.<ref>[http://www.saskatchewanstockgrowers.com/ "Saskatchewan Stock Growers Association"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410113335/http://www.saskatchewanstockgrowers.com/ |date=April 10, 2016 }}, Official Website</ref>
[[File:Maury Geography 073A Saskatchewan.jpg|thumb|left|Farmers at work in 1907. The introduction of [[Marquis wheat]] saw wheat output soar in the province.]]
Immigration peaked in 1910, and in spite of the initial difficulties of frontier life – distance from towns, sod homes, and backbreaking labour – new settlers established a European-Canadian style of prosperous [[agrarian society]]. The long-term prosperity of the province depended on the world price of grain, which headed steadily upward from the 1880s to 1920, then plunged down. Wheat output was increased by new strains, such as the "[[Marquis wheat]]" strain which matured 8 days sooner and yielded 7 more bushels per acre (0.72&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/ha) than the previous standard, "[[Red Fife]]". The national output of wheat soared from {{convert|8|e6impbu|lk=in}} in 1896, to {{cvt|26|e6impbu}} in 1901, reaching {{cvt|151|e6impbu}} by 1921.<ref>{{cite book|author=Arthur Henry Reginald Buller|title=Essays on Wheat: Including the Discovery and Introduction of Marquis Wheat, the Early History of Wheat-growing in Manitoba, Wheat in Western Canada, the Origin of Red Bobs and Kitchener, and the Wild Wheat of Palestine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YqMUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA218|year=1919|pages=218–20|access-date=March 27, 2018|archive-date=September 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922193714/https://books.google.com/books?id=YqMUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA218|url-status=live}}</ref>

Urban reform movements in Regina were based on support from business and professional groups. City planning, reform of local government, and municipal ownership of utilities were more widely supported by these two groups, often through such organizations as the Board of Trade. Church-related and other altruistic organizations generally supported social welfare and housing reforms; these groups were generally less successful in getting their own reforms enacted.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hengen | first1 = Girard | year = 1988 | title = A Case Study in Urban Reform: Regina Before the First World War | journal = Saskatchewan History | volume = 41 | issue = 1| pages = 19–34 }}</ref>

The province responded to the First World War in 1914 with patriotic enthusiasm and enjoyed the resultant economic boom for farms and cities alike. Emotional and intellectual support for the war emerged from the politics of Canadian national identity, the rural myth, and social gospel progressivism The Church of England was especially supportive. However, there was strong hostility toward German-Canadian farmers.<ref>James M. Pitsula, ''For All We Have and Are: Regina and the Experience of the Great War'' (U of Manitoba Press, 2008), p 280.

The price of wheat tripled and acreage seeded doubled. The wartime spirit of sacrifice intensified social reform movements that had predated the war and now came to fruition. Saskatchewan gave women the right to vote in 1916 and at the end of 1916 passed a referendum to prohibit the sale of alcohol.

In the late 1920s, the [[Ku Klux Klan in Canada|Ku Klux Klan]], imported from the United States and Ontario, gained brief popularity in nativist circles in Saskatchewan and Alberta. The Klan, briefly allied with the provincial Conservative party because of their mutual dislike for Premier [[James G. Gardiner|James G. "Jimmy" Gardiner]] and his Liberals (who ferociously fought the Klan), enjoyed about two years of prominence. It declined and disappeared, subject to widespread political and media opposition, plus internal scandals involving the use of the organization's funds.

==== Post–Second World War ====
In 1970, the first annual [[Canadian Western Agribition]] was held in Regina.

Since the late 20th century, First Nations have become more politically active in seeking justice for past inequities, especially related to the taking of indigenous lands by various governments. The federal and provincial governments have negotiated on numerous land claims, and developed a program of "Treaty Land Entitlement", enabling First Nations to buy land to be taken into reserves with money from settlements of claims.
<blockquote>"In 1992, the federal and provincial governments signed an historic land claim agreement with Saskatchewan First Nations. Under the Agreement, the First Nations received money to buy land on the open market. As a result, about 761,000 acres have been turned into reserve land and many First Nations continue to invest their settlement dollars in urban areas", including Saskatoon. The money from such settlements has enabled First Nations to invest in businesses and other economic infrastructure.<ref name="aadnc-aandc1" /></blockquote>

[[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] runs the NATO Flying Training Centre at 15 Wing, near [[Moose Jaw]]. Bombardier was awarded a long-term contract in the late 1990s for $2.8 billion from the [[Politics of Canada|federal government]] for the purchase of military aircraft and the running of the training facility. [[SaskPower]] since 1929 has been the principal supplier of electricity in Saskatchewan, serving more than 451,000 customers and managing $4.5 billion in assets. SaskPower is a major employer in the province with almost 2,500 permanent full-time staff in 71 communities.

== Education ==
{{Main|Education in Saskatchewan}}
Publicly funded elementary and secondary schools in the province are administered by [[List of Saskatchewan school divisions|twenty-seven school divisions]]. Public elementary and secondary schools either operate as [[secular education|secular]] or as a [[separate school]]s. Nearly all school divisions, except one operate as an English [[first language]] school board. The Division scolaire francophone No. 310 is the only school division that operates French first language schools. In addition to elementary and secondary schools, the province is also home to several post-secondary institutions.

The first education on the prairies took place within the family groups of the First Nations and early [[fur trade|fur trading]] settlers. There were only a few missionary or trading post schools established in [[Rupert's Land]] – later known as the [[Territorial evolution of Canada|North West Territories]]. The first 76 [[North-West Territories]] school districts and the first Board of Education meeting formed in 1886. The pioneering boom formed [[Block Settlement|ethnic bloc settlements]]. Communities were seeking education for their children similar to the schools of their homeland. [[Log cabin]]s, and dwellings were constructed for the assembly of the community, school, church, dances and meetings.

The prosperity of the [[Roaring Twenties]] and the success of farmers in proving up on their homesteads helped provide funding to standardize education.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Milne |first=Jennifer |date=February 2004 |title=CULTIVATING DOMESTICITY: THE HOMEMAKERS' CLUBS OF SASKATCHEWAN, 1911 TO 1961 |url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk3/SSU/TC-SSU-07112005100045.pdf |access-date=April 8, 2024 |website=www.collectionscanada.gc.ca}}</ref> Textbooks, normal schools for educating teachers, formal school curricula and state of the art [[One-room school|school house]] [[architectural plan]]s provided continuity throughout the province. English as the school language helped to provide economic stability because one community could communicate with another and goods could be traded and sold in a common language. The number of one-room schoolhouse districts across Saskatchewan totalled approximately 5,000 at the height of this system of education in the late 1940s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://skschool.site123.me/|title=Saskatchewan One Room School House Project|website=SkSchool|language=en|access-date=2018-12-10|archive-date=August 17, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210817060403/https://skschool.site123.me/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Following World War II, the transition from many one-room schoolhouses to fewer and larger consolidated modern technological town and city schools occurred as a means of ensuring technical education. School buses, highways, and family vehicles create ease and accessibility of a population shift to larger towns and cities. Combines and tractors mean the farmer could manage more than a quarter section of land, so there was a shift from [[family farm]]s and [[subsistence crops]] to [[cash crops]] grown on many sections of land. [[School vouchers]] have been newly proposed as a means of allowing competition between rural schools and making the operation of [[cooperative school]]s practicable in rural areas.

== Healthcare ==
[[File:Royal University Hospital.jpg|thumb|The [[Royal University Hospital]] is one of [[List of hospitals in Saskatchewan|several hospitals operating in Saskatchewan]].]]
Saskatchewan's [[Ministry of Health (Saskatchewan)|Ministry of Health]] is responsible for policy direction, sets and monitors standards, and provides funding for regional health authorities and provincial health services. Saskatchewan's health system is a [[single payer health care|single-payer system]]. Medical practitioners in Saskatchewan are independent contractors. They remit their accounts to the publicly funded Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Plan, which pays the accounts. Patients do not pay anything to their doctors or hospitals for medical care.<ref>{{cite web|title=How Saskatchewan Health Pays Your Bill – Health – Government of Saskatchewan|url=http://www.health.gov.sk.ca/benefits-bill-payment|website=health.gov.sk|publisher=Health.gov.sk.ca|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101104417/http://www.health.gov.sk.ca/benefits-bill-payment |archive-date=November 1, 2007|access-date=February 23, 2011}}</ref>

In 1944, the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF), a left-wing agrarian and labour party, won the provincial election in Saskatchewan and formed the first socialist government in North American history. Repeatedly re-elected, the CCF campaigned in the early 1960s on the theme of [[universal health coverage]] and, after winning the election again, implemented it, the first in Canada. However, it was fiercely opposed by the province's doctors' union, which went on a massive strike the day the new system came into effect. Supported by the Saskatchewan Chamber of Commerce, most newspapers and the right-wing Keep Our Doctors movement, the doctors' union ran an effective communications campaign portraying the universal health care system as a communist scheme that would spread disease. The strike, which had become very unpopular because of the outrageous rhetoric of some of its leaders (one of them had called for bloodshed), finally ended after a few weeks, and universal health coverage was adopted by the whole country five years later.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://mondediplo.com/2020/08/02populism-expertise | title=It's the healthcare system, stupid | date=August 2020 }}</ref>

During the 20th century, Saskatchewan was one of Canada's more left-wing provinces, reflecting the slant of its many rural citizens which distrusted the distant capital government and which favoured a strong local government to attend to their issues. In 1944 [[Tommy Douglas]] became premier of the first avowedly [[socialism|socialist]] regional government in North America. Most of his [[Members of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLAs) represented rural and small-town ridings. Under his [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]] government, Saskatchewan became the first province to have [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]]. In 1961, Douglas left provincial politics to become the first leader of the federal [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]]. In the 21st century, Saskatchewan began to drift to the right-wing, generally attributed to the [[Petroleum industry in Canada#Saskatchewan|province's economy shifting toward oil and gas production]]. In the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 federal election]], the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] won ten of the province's fourteen seats, followed by the [[New Democratic Party]] with three and the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] with one; in the [[2019 Canadian federal election|2019 election]], the Conservatives won in all of Saskatchewan's 14 seats, sweeping their competition, and retained them all in the [[2021 Canadian federal election|2021 election]].

Provincial politics in Saskatchewan is dominated by the [[social democracy|social-democratic]] [[Saskatchewan New Democratic Party]] and the centre-right [[Saskatchewan Party]], with the latter holding the majority in the [[Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan]] since [[2007 Saskatchewan general election|2007]]. The current [[Premier of Saskatchewan]] is [[Scott Moe]], who took over the leadership of the Saskatchewan Party in [[2018 Saskatchewan Party leadership election|2018]] following the resignation of [[Brad Wall]]. Numerous smaller political parties also run candidates in provincial elections, including the [[Green Party of Saskatchewan]], [[Buffalo Party of Saskatchewan]], [[Saskatchewan Progress Party]], and the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan]], but none is currently represented in the Legislative Assembly.

No [[Prime Minister of Canada]] has been born in Saskatchewan, but two ([[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] and [[John Diefenbaker]]) represented the province in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] during their tenures as head of government.
