== History of Kujiki ==
{{more citations needed section|date=November 2021}}
According to ''Sendai Kuji Hongi'' ({{Lang|ja-latn|[[Kujiki]]}}), Chichibu was one of 137 provinces during the reign of [[Emperor Sujin]].<ref>Enbutsu, Sumiko. (1990). [http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&hl=en&q=kujiki+%2B+chichibu&btnG=  ''Chichibu: Japan's hidden treasure,'' p. 13] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201016050040/http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&hl=en&q=kujiki+%2B+chichibu&btnG= |date=2020-10-16 }}.</ref> [[Chichibu Province]] was in western Saitama.

The area that would become Saitama Prefecture in the 19th century is part of [[Musashi Province]] in the [[Ritsuryō]] (or ryō-system; ritsu stands for the penal code, ryō for the administrative code) Imperial administration of antiquity (see [[Provinces of Japan]] and the [[Gokishichidō|5 (go) capital area provinces (ki)/7 (shichi) circuits (dō)]] system) which was nominally revived in the Meiji restoration but has lost much of its administrative function since the Middle Ages.<ref>Nussbaum, "Provinces and prefectures" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 780|page=780}}.</ref> [[Saitama District, Musashi|Saitama District]] ''(Saitama-gun)'' was one of Musashi's 21 ritsuryō [[Districts of Japan|districts]].

In the fifth year of the [[Keiun]] [[Japanese era names|era]] (708), deposits of copper were reported to have been found in the [[Chichibu District, Saitama|Chichibu District]] of what is now Saitama Prefecture.

The Saitama area was historically known as a fertile agricultural region which produced much of the food for the Kantō region. During the [[Edo period]], many ''[[fudai]] [[daimyō]]s'' ruled small domains within the Saitama area.

At the end of the early modern [[Edo period]], large parts of present-day Saitama were part of the shogunate domain (''[[tenryō|baku-ryō]]'') or the often subsumed holdings of smaller vassals ''([[hatamoto]]-ryō)'' around Edo, major areas were part of the fiefdoms ''([[Han system|-han]])'' [[Kawagoe Domain|Kawagoe]] (ruled by Matsui/[[Matsudaira clan|Matsudaira]], ''fudai''), [[Oshi Domain|Oshi]] (Okudaira-Matsudaira, ''fudai'') and [[Iwatsuki Domain|Iwatsuki]] ([[Ōoka clan|Ōoka]], ''fudai''); few territories were held by domains seated in other provinces.

[[File:Saitama Prefectural Office in the Taisho era.JPG|thumb|The prefectural government building of Saitama in the early 20th century]]
In the [[Meiji Restoration]], after being briefly united with other rural shogunate territories in Musashi under Musashi governors ''(Musashi chikenji)'', many former shogunate/hatamoto territories in Northwestern Musashi became '''Ōmiya Prefecture''' (大宮県, ''Ōmiya-ken''), soon renamed to '''Urawa''' (浦和県, ''-ken'') in 1868/69, with some territories held by other short-lived prefectures ({{ill|Iwahana Prefecture|ja|岩鼻県|lt=Iwahana}}/later mainly Gunma and {{ill|Nirayama Prefecture|ja|韮山県|lt=Nirayama}}/later mainly Shizuoka, Kanagawa and Tokyo). In the [[Abolition of the han system|replacement of ''-han'' with ''-ken'']], the associated territorial consolidation (removal of feudal era ex-/enclaves) and first wave of prefectural mergers in 1871/72, Oshi and Iwatsuki prefectures were merged into Urawa; after consolidation, it consisted of the entire Saitama District and Northern parts of [[Adachi District, Musashi|Adachi]] and [[Katsushika District, Musashi|Katsushika]] (But at that time, "major and minor districts", 大区, ''daiku'' and 小区, ''shōku'', served as administrative subdivisions) and was renamed to '''Saitama'''. The government of the prefecture was to be set up in Iwatsuki Town, Saitama District in November 1871 by the [[Dajōkan]] ordinance to set up the prefecture, but ultimately remained in Urawa's previous prefectural government seat in Urawa Town in Adachi District.

Kawagoe Prefecture was consolidated with other territories into {{ill|Iruma Prefecture|ja|入間県}} (入間県, ''Iruma-ken''; government seat unchanged from Kawagoe domain/prefecture: Kawagoe Town, Iruma District) which consisted of 13 districts of Musashi in the Western part of present-day Saitama. In 1873, Iruma was merged with [[Gunma Prefecture|Gunma]] (capital: Takasaki Town, Gunma District) to become [[Kumagaya Prefecture|Kumagaya]] (capital: Kumagaya Town, Ōsato District). But Kumagaya was split up again in 1876: The area of Kōzuke province came back as a second Gunma prefecture, and the territories in Musashi province/former Iruma prefecture were merged into Saitama. Except for the transfer of a few municipalities to [[Tokyo]] in the 1890s/1900s (see below) and several smaller, 20th century changes through cross-prefectural municipal mergers or transfers of neighbourhoods, Saitama had reached its present extent.

[[File:SaitamaPref-counties.svg|thumb|The nine 19th/20th century districts of Saitama with 21st century municipal borders overlayed. From the East, dark violet: North Katsushika, light blue: North Saitama, dark blue: South Saitama, pink: North Adachi, orange: Iruma, pale yellow: Hiki, dark green: Ōsato, pale green: Kodama, purple: Chichibu.]]
In the modern reactivation of districts as administrative unit in 1878/79, Saitama was subdivided into originally 18 districts based on the ancient divisions of Musashi, but with only nine (joint) district government offices, and the number of districts was formally merged down to nine in 1896/97: [[Kita-Adachi District, Saitama|North Adachi]], [[Iruma District, Saitama|Iruma]], [[Hiki District, Saitama|Hiki]], [[Chichibu District, Saitama|Chichibu]], [[Kodama District, Saitama|Kodama]], [[Ōsato District, Saitama|Ōsato]], [[Kita-Saitama District, Saitama|North Saitama]], [[Minami-Saitama District, Saitama|South Saitama]], and [[Kita-Katsushika District, Saitama|North Katsushika]]. [[Niikura District, Musashi|Niikura (also known as Niiza, Shiki or Shiragi)]], one of the original 1878/79 modern districts, was first merged into North Adachi in 1896, but a substantial part of its former territory was subsequently transferred to the [[Kita-Tama District, Tokyo|North Tama]] and [[Kita-Toshima District, Tokyo|North Toshima]] districts of Tokyo. In the creation of [[Municipalities of Japan|modern cities, towns and villages]] in 1889, these districts were subdivided into originally 40 [[Towns of Japan|towns]] and 368 [[Villages of Japan|villages]]. The first [[Cities of Japan|city]] in Saitama was only established in 1922 when Kawagoe Town from Iruma District became [[Kawagoe, Saitama|Kawagoe City]]. The prefectural capital, Urawa in North Adachi, remained a town until 1934. After the Great Shōwa mergers of the 1950s, the number of municipalities in Saitama had shrunk to 95, including 23 cities by then. The Great Heisei mergers of the 2000s pushed the number below 70.

After [[World War II]], as Tokyo expanded rapidly and modern transportation allowed longer commutes, the lack of available land in Tokyo led to the rapid development of Saitama Prefecture, where the population has nearly tripled since 1960. Most of the cities in the prefecture are closely connected to downtown Tokyo by metropolitan rail, and operate largely as residential and commercial suburbs of Tokyo.

In 2001, [[Urawa, Saitama|Urawa City]] was merged with [[Ōmiya, Saitama|Ōmiya City]] and [[Yono, Saitama|Yono City]] to create [[Saitama City]] (''Saitama-shi''; but unlike the district or the prefecture written with [[Kana]]) as the new enlarged capital. It became the prefecture's first (and so far only) [[Designated cities of Japan|designated major city]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url-status=dead|website=Saitama prefectural government |url=https://www.pref.saitama.lg.jp/a0301/saitama-profile/documents/5-01b.pdf|script-title=ja:埼玉県近現代史主要年表|lang=Japanese|trans-title=Saitama prefectural modern history [1868–2016] chronological table of major events |access-date=June 27, 2020|archive-date=June 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200627165351/https://www.pref.saitama.lg.jp/a0301/saitama-profile/documents/5-01b.pdf }}</ref>

Saitama Prefecture is bordered by [[Tokyo]], [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]], [[Ibaraki Prefecture|Ibaraki]], [[Tochigi Prefecture|Tochigi]], [[Gunma Prefecture|Gunma]], [[Nagano Prefecture|Nagano]], and [[Yamanashi Prefecture|Yamanashi]] Prefectures. It is located central-west of the Kanto region, measuring 103&nbsp;km from east to west and 52&nbsp;km from north to south.  At 3,797.75&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, it ranks as the ninth-smallest prefecture. The eastern border with [[Chiba Prefecture]] is defined by the [[Edo River]]. The northern and north-western border lines with [[Gunma Prefecture]] are marked by the [[Tone River]] and the [[Kanagawa River]] and the [[drainage divide]]s of the [[Arakawa River (Kanto)|Arakawa River]] and Kanagawa River. The southwestern border is defined by the drainage divides of the Arakawa River, [[Tama River]], and [[Fuefuki River]]. The eastern section of the southern border line, however, does not overlap with any geological feature.

The topography of Saitama Prefecture is largely divided by the Hachiōji Tectonic Line, which runs through [[Kodama, Saitama|Kodama]], [[Ogawa, Saitama|Ogawa]], and [[Hannō, Saitama|Hannō]], into the western mountain area and the eastern lowland area. The altitude, highest on the western side, gradually lowers eastward from mountain ranges to hills to plateaus to lowlands. The eastern lowlands and plateaus occupy 67.3% of the area.<ref>{{cite web|author=埼玉県総務部広聴広報課 |url=http://www.pref.saitama.lg.jp/kodomo/ken/kisyoh.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206034809/http://www.pref.saitama.lg.jp/kodomo/ken/kisyoh.htm |archive-date=2008-02-06 |title=埼玉県／彩の国わくわくこどもページ／県のあらまし／土地・気象 |date=2008-02-06 |access-date=2010-12-07}}</ref>

The eastern side, part of the [[Kantō Plain]], can be further divided into nine separate expanses of hills and ten plateaus.  The former occupy small areas neighboring the Kantō Mount Range, including the Hiki Hills and Sayama Hills. The latter are mainly surrounded by alluvial flood plains. In the southeastern portion of the prefecture, the Ōmiya Plateau stands in a southeastward direction, sandwiched by the Furutone River to the east and the Arakawa River to the west.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pref.saitama.lg.jp/A08/BG00/kasen/koumoku/kasen2.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040928022615/http://www.pref.saitama.lg.jp/A08/BG00/kasen/koumoku/kasen2.html |archive-date=2004-09-28 |title=地形と歴史 |date=2004-09-28 |access-date=2010-12-07}}</ref>

The western side of the prefecture belongs to the [[Kantō Mountains|Kantō Mountain Range]] with Chichibu Basin located in its center. The area to the west of the basin features high peaks such as [[Mount Sanpō]] (2,483 m; 三宝山, ''Sanpō-yama'' according to the GSI, but often read ''Sanpō-zan''<!--according to [[:ja:三宝山]] or many online search hits, even on pref. gov. pages for children: https://www.pref.saitama.lg.jp/a0206/kodomo/data01_tochi-kishou.html!-->) on the Western border with Nagano, Saitama's highest mountain,<ref>[[Geospatial Information Authority of Japan|GSI]]: [https://www.gsi.go.jp/kihonjohochousa/kihonjohochousa41196.html 都道府県の最高地点] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200704135108/https://www.gsi.go.jp/kihonjohochousa/kihonjohochousa41196.html |date=2020-07-04 }} (Japanese, ''-to/-dō/-fu/-ken no saikōchiten''; "highest points of each prefecture"), retrieved June 27, 2020.</ref> and [[Mount Kobushi|Mount Kōbushi]] (2,475 m), in which the Arakawa River has its source. Most of the land is contained in [[Chichibu Tama Kai National Park]]. The area to east of the basin consists of relatively low mountains.

== Politics and government ==
[[File:埼玉県庁舎.JPG|thumb|The current prefectural government [main] building in Saitama City]]
Like all prefectural administrations, Saitama's is headed by a governor ''([ken-]chiji)'' who is directly elected to four-year terms since 1947. The current incumbent is [[Motohiro Ōno]], a former DPFP member of the Diet who was elected in August 2019 with centre-left support (CDP, DPFP, SDP) and 47.9% of the vote against centre-right supported (LDP, Kōmeitō) former baseball player [[Kenta Aoshima]] (44.9%) and three other candidates.<ref>[[NHK]]SenkyoWeb, August 26, 2019: [https://www.nhk.or.jp/senkyo/database/local/2019/saitama-chiji/ 2019 Saitama gubernatorial election result and summary coverage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201002053305/https://www.nhk.or.jp/senkyo/database/local/2019/saitama-chiji/ |date=2020-10-02 }} (Japanese), retrieved June 27, 2020.</ref>

Also as in all prefectures, prefectural by-laws, the budget and the approval of important prefectural administrative appointments such as the vice-governors or members of the public safety commission, are the prerogative of the [[Saitama Prefectural Assembly|assembly]] which is elected directly to four-year terms on an independent electoral cycle. That may or may not be synchronized with the gubernatorial term; currently, it is not, as it is still part of the unified local election cycle (Saitama gubernatorial elections already left the unified cycle in 1949). In the [[2019 Japanese unified local elections|last round in April 2019]], the LDP maintained its outright majority with 48 of the 93 seats in the assembly.<ref>[[NHK]]SenkyoWeb: 2019 unified local election results/prefectural assembly elections/[https://www.nhk.or.jp/senkyo/database/touitsu/2019/11/14633/jyo14633.html Saitama] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210704133820/https://www.nhk.or.jp/senkyo/database/touitsu/2019/11/14633/jyo14633.html |date=2021-07-04 }} (Japanese), retrieved June 27, 2020.</ref> As in most prefectures, the Saitama assembly was established legally in 1878 and first convened 1879.<ref>Saitama Prefectural Assembly: [http://extra.pref.saitama.lg.jp/s-gikai/tour/05history.html Chronological table] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116054622/http://extra.pref.saitama.lg.jp/s-gikai/tour/05history.html |date=2020-11-16 }}</ref>

In the [[National Diet]], Saitama's directly elected delegation consists of 15 members of the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] and currently seven (four per class, but only raised from three in 2019, so it will only grow to eight after the 2022 election) in the [[House of Councillors (Japan)|House of Councillors]]. The latest prefecture-wide election was the House of Councillors by-election in October 2019 to fill the seat vacated by Motohiro Ōno; it was won by the previous governor [[Kiyoshi Ueda]] who has a centre-left background (DPJ member of the House of Representatives for Saitama's 4th district before his term as governor), but without full-scale party backing and without any other major party-backed candidate in the race.<ref>[[NHK]]SenkyoWeb, October 27, 2019: [https://www.nhk.or.jp/senkyo/database/sangiin/hosen/2019/saitama/ 2019 HC Saitama constituency by-election result and summary coverage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201025214839/https://www.nhk.or.jp/senkyo/database/sangiin/hosen/2019/saitama/ |date=2020-10-25 }} (Japanese), retrieved June 27, 2020.</ref>
