In 2017, [[The Sunday Guardian]] reported, “The crackdown by the Border Security Force (BSF) on the illegal, but lucrative, business of cow smuggling along the India-Bangladesh border in West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district, resulted in immense resentment among a section of the area’s minority community. This culminated in the communal flare-up in the state’s Basirhat sub-division earlier this month. A source close to the state’s ruling Trinamool Congress told The Sunday Guardian over phone, “Cow smuggling to Bangladesh, through the riverine border in Basirhat, Taki and other adjoining areas, has taken a hit as the BSF has become very strict and is maintaining a constant vigil. This has hurt the locals, who were earning crores from these illegal activities. Rendered jobless, they blamed the situation on the majority community.””<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/10167-crackdown-cow-smuggling-triggered-basirhat-violence |title =  Crack down on cow smuggling triggered Basirhat violence | work= Dibyendu Mondal |date = 15 July 2017 |publisher=  The Sunday Guardian, 16 July 2017 | access-date = 20 December 2018 }}</ref>
