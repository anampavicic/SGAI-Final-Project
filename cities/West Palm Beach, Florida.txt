The beginning of the historic period in south Florida is marked by [[Juan Ponce de León]]'s first contact with native people in 1513. [[Europeans]] found a thriving native population, which they categorized into separate tribes: the [[Mayaimi]] in the Lake Okeechobee Basin and the [[Jaega]] and [[Ais people]] in the East Okeechobee area and o the east coast north of the [[Tequesta]]. When the Spanish arrived, there were around 20,000 Native Americans in south Florida. By 1763, by the time the English gained control of Florida, the native peoples had been all but wiped out through war, enslavement, or European diseases.<ref>[http://www.pbchistoryonline.org/page/native-americans Native Americans]. Pbchistoryonline.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-16.</ref>

Other native peoples from [[Alabama]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] moved into Florida in the early 18th century. They were of varied ancestry, but Europeans called them all "Creeks." In Florida, they were known as the [[Seminole]] and [[Miccosukee]] Indians. The Seminoles clashed with American settlers over land and over escaped slaves who found refuge among them. They resisted the government's efforts to move them to the [[Indian Territory]] west of the [[Mississippi River]]. Between 1818 and 1858, three wars were fought between Seminoles and the United States government. By 1858, there were very few Seminoles remaining in Florida.<ref>[http://www.pbchistoryonline.org/page/the-seminole-war-in-palm-beach-county The Seminole War in Palm Beach County]. Pbchistoryonline.org. Retrieved 2013-08-16.</ref>

The area that was to become West Palm Beach was settled in the late 1870s and 1880s by a few hundred settlers who called the vicinity "Lake Worth Country." These settlers were a diverse community from different parts of the United States and the world. They included founding families such as the Potters and the Lainharts, who would go on to become leading members of the business community in the fledgling city. The first white settlers in Palm Beach County lived around Lake Worth, which at the time was an enclosed freshwater lake, named after Colonel [[William Jenkins Worth]], who had fought in the Second Seminole War in Florida in 1842. Most settlers engaged in the growing of tropical fruits and vegetables for shipment to the north via Lake Worth and the Indian River. By 1890, the U.S. Census counted over 200 people settled along Lake Worth in the vicinity of what would become West Palm Beach. The area at this time also boasted a hotel, the "Cocoanut House", a church, and a post office. The city was platted by [[Henry Morrison Flagler|Henry Flagler]] as a community to house the servants working in the two grand [[hotel]]s on the neighboring island of [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]], across [[Lake Worth Lagoon|Lake Worth]] in 1893, coinciding with the arrival of the Florida East Coast railroad. Flagler paid two area settlers, Captain Porter and Louie Hillhouse, a combined sum of $45,000 for the original town's site, stretching from Clear Lake to Lake Worth.

On November 5, 1894, 78 people met at the "Calaboose" (the first jail and police station located at Clematis St. and Poinsettia, now Dixie Hwy.), and passed the motion to incorporate the Town of West Palm Beach in what was then Dade County (now [[Miami-Dade County]]).<ref name="cityofwpb.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofwpb.com/history/history.htm |title=Historic Gallery |publisher=The City of West Palm Beach |access-date=2010-11-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121014510/http://cityofwpb.com/history/history.htm |archive-date=November 21, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> This made West Palm Beach the first incorporated [[municipality]] in Dade County and in [[South Florida]]. The town council quickly addressed the building codes and the tents and shanties were replaced by brick, brick veneer, and stone buildings. The city grew steadily during the 1890s and the first two decades of the 20th century, most residents were engaged in the tourist industry and related services or winter vegetable market and tropical fruit trade. In 1909, Palm Beach County was formed by the Florida State Legislature and West Palm Beach became the county seat. In 1916, a new neo-classical courthouse was opened, which has been painstakingly restored back to its original condition and is now used as the local history museum.

The city grew rapidly in the 1920s as part of the [[Florida land boom of the 1920s|Florida land boom]]. The population of West Palm Beach quadrupled from 1920 to 1927, and all kinds of businesses and public services grew along with it. Many of the city's landmark structures and preserved neighborhoods were constructed during this period. Originally, Flagler intended for his [[Florida East Coast Railway]] to have its [[Terminal station|terminus]] in West Palm, but after the area experienced a deep freeze, he chose to extend the railroad to Miami instead.

The land boom was already faltering when city was devastated by the [[1928 Okeechobee hurricane]]. The Depression years of the 1930s were a quiet time for the area, which saw slight population growth and property values lower than during the 1920s. The city only recovered with the onset of World War II, which saw the construction of [[Palm Beach Air Force Base]], which brought thousands of military personnel to the city. The base was vital to the allied war effort, as it provided an excellent training facility and had unparalleled access to North Africa for a North American city. Also during World War II, German U-boats sank two dozen merchant ships and oil tankers just off the coast of West Palm Beach. Nearby Palm Beach was under blackout conditions to minimize night visibility to German U-boats.<ref>[https://www.westpalmbeach.com/when-a-german-u-boat-attacked-palm-beach-county/ When German U-boats attacked Palm Beach County], westpalmbeach.com. Accessed June 22, 2023.</ref>

The 1950s saw another boom in population, partly due to the return of many soldiers and airmen who had served in the vicinity during the war. Also, the advent of [[air conditioning]] encouraged growth, as year-round living in a tropical climate became more acceptable to northerners. West Palm Beach became one of the nation's fastest-growing metropolitan areas during the 1950s; the city's borders spread west of Military Trail and south to Lake Clarke Shores. However, many of the city's residents still lived within a narrow six-block wide strip from the south to north end. The neighborhoods were strictly segregated between White and African-American populations, a legacy that the city still struggles with today. The primary shopping district remained downtown, centered around Clematis Street.<ref name="CESAJ-PM(Cong)" />

In the 1960s, Palm Beach County's first enclosed shopping mall, the [[Palm Beach Mall]], and an indoor arena were completed. These projects led to a brief revival for the city, but in the 1970s and 1980s crime continued to be a serious issue and suburban sprawl continued to drain resources and business away from the old downtown area. By the early 1990s there were very high vacancy rates downtown, and serious levels of urban blight.<ref name=":0" />

Since the 1990s, developments such as [[CityPlace (West Palm Beach)|CityPlace]] and the preservation and renovation of 1920s architecture in the nightlife hub of Clematis Street have seen a downtown resurgence in the [[entertainment]] and shopping district. The city has also placed emphasis on neighborhood development and revitalization, in historic districts such as Northwood, Flamingo Park, and El Cid. Some neighborhoods still struggle with blight and crime, as well as lowered property values caused by the Great Recession, which hit the region particularly hard. Since the recovery, multiple new developments have been completed. The Palm Beach Mall, located at the Interstate 95/Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard interchange became abandoned as downtown revitalized - the very mall that initiated the original abandonment of the downtown. The mall was then redeveloped into the Palm Beach Fashion Outlets in February 2014. The [[West Palm Beach station (Brightline)|West Palm Beach station]] for [[Brightline]], a [[High-speed rail|high speed passenger rail]] service serving Miami, [[Fort Lauderdale]], and West Palm Beach, was opened in 2018.<ref name=":1" />

===West Palm Beach Canal (C51)===
According to the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], the West Palm Beach Canal (C-51)/Stormwater Treatment Area (STA)1 East project was authorized by the [[U.S. Congress]] under the Flood Control Acts of 1948, 1954, 1962, 1968, and the [[Water Resources Development Act]] (WRDA) of 1996. The project is located in [[Palm Beach County]] and runs east to west from [[West Palm Beach]] at Lake Worth to Water Conservation Area (WCA) No. 1 ([[Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge]]). The authorized project will provide 30-year flood protection to the urbanized eastern basin and 10-year flood protection to the western basin. All eastern basin features have been completed.<ref name="CESAJ-PM(Cong)">{{cite web|url= http://www.saj.usace.army.mil/Portals/44/docs/CongressionalFS/2015/CSF_West_Palm_Beach_Canal_%28C51%29_%28C%29_CFS15.pdf |title= Congressional Fact Sheet - West Palm Beach Canal (C51) |date=March 2015 |website=U.S. Army Corps of Engineers |access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref>

During mediation of the Everglades water quality litigation, a technical plan was developed for resolution of the litigation. The technical plan included a substantially modified C-51 project. The modified plan expands the original 1,600-acre floodwater detention area into a 6,500-acre stormwater detention area. In addition to the flood damage reduction benefits provided by the original project, the modified plan provides [[water treatment]], reduction of damaging freshwater [[discharge (hydrology)|discharges]] to [[Lake Worth Lagoon|Lake Worth]], and increased [[water supply]] for the [[Everglades]] and other users.<ref name="CESAJ-PM(Cong)"/>

According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the total estimated cost of the West Palm Beach Canal (C51) is $375.47 million, with an estimated $345.04 million as the Federal Government's cost share. A total of $1.05 million was appropriated for this project by the U.S. Congress in Fiscal Year 2015. The Fiscal Year 2016 Budget Request from the [[U.S. President]] to the U.S. Congress was for $1 million.<ref name="CESAJ-PM(Cong)"/>

==Geography==
[[File:Habitat of Semiardistomis viridis (Say) at Grassy Waters Preserve, West Palm Beach, Florida, USA - ZooKeys-210-019-g018.jpeg|thumb|The Grassy Waters Preserve]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], this city has a total area of {{convert|58.2|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|55.1|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|3.1|sqmi|km2}} (5.26%) is water.

Due to vast areas of [[wetland]] immediately to the west of the city's downtown, growth took place to the north and south in a linear fashion. Until the 1960s, the city was no more than several blocks wide but over 100 blocks in length. Large scale development finally expanded to the west of the city with improved access and drainage in the 1960s. However, the city boundaries were not expanded much with the exception of the "Water Catchment Area", an uninhabited area in the northwest part of the city. Known as Grassy Waters, it now serves as a reservoir for the city drinking water as well as a nature preserve.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://wpb.org/grassywaters/preserve.php|website=Grassy Waters|publisher=City of West Palm Beach|title=About Grassy Waters Preserve}}</ref>

'''Bel Air Historic District''': Developed from 1925 to 1935 as a neighborhood for tradesmen and real estate salesmen who helped develop Palm Beach County, some of Belair was originally a pineapple plantation owned by Richard Hone. Hones's frame vernacular house, built around 1895, still stands at 211 Plymouth Road. After Hone was murdered in 1902, his property was sold to George Currie, who created Currie Development Co. But before it was developed, the land was sold to William Ohlhaber, who raised coconut palms and ferns. Eventually, Ohlhaber platted the subdivision and sold off lots. The first house built in the subdivision was Ohlhaber's mission-style home at 205 Pilgrim. Ohlhaber's grandson said Ohlhaber bought the tract to provide dockage for his {{convert|90|ft|m|adj=on}} yacht, but the yacht ran aground in the Gulf of Mexico and never reached Lake Worth. In 1947 Hone's house was bought by Max Brombacher, Henry Flagler's chief engineer, and it remains in the Brombacher family today. Belair became West Palm Beach's fourth historic district in August 1993.<ref name=":1" />

'''[[Central Park Historic District (West Palm Beach, Florida)|Central Park]]''': Central Park is a collective name for several subdivisions north of Southern Boulevard. It originally was part of the Estates of South Palm Beach (which went from Wenonah Place to Pilgrim Road east of Dixie Highway). Like other West Palm Beach neighborhoods, the Estates of South Palm Beach boomed after Henry Flagler's descent on Palm Beach. In 1884, James W. Copp, a bachelor in the boating business, borrowed $367.20 from Valentine Jones to buy the land. The ownership of what is now known as Central Park changed hands many times before being developed. Around 1919, the tropical wilderness was transformed into an exclusive neighborhood with curbed roads, sidewalks and a pier (at the foot of what is now Southern Boulevard). The neighborhood became part of West Palm Beach in 1926, and was named a city historic district in December 1993. In 1999 the neighborhood was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

'''[[El Cid Historic District|El Cid]]''': Noted for its Mediterranean revival and mission-style homes, El Cid developed in the height of Florida's real estate boom. In the late 19th century, most of the land north of Sunset Road was pineapple fields, but the crop dwindled in the early 20th century. Pittsburgh socialite Jay Phipps subdivided the old pineapple fields in the 1920s. He named it El Cid, after the celebrated Spanish hero, Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, who conquered Valencia in 1094. He was called "Cid", meaning "lord". El Cid became a city historic district in June 1993. In 1995 the neighborhood was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

'''[[Flamingo Park Historic Residential District|Flamingo Park]]''': Originally a pineapple plantation, Flamingo Park was established by local contractors and developers, who saw the potential in this area—one of the highest coastal ridge sections from downtown West Palm Beach to Miami. Some ridge houses even had ocean views from upper floors. Houses cost about $10,000 to $18,000 in the boom era, and many buyers were owners of shops and businesses on fashionable Dixie Highway nearby. Recently, residents rallied to have stop signs installed throughout the neighborhood and have banded together to ward off commercial and industrial zoning. Property values are rising as residents renovate and restore Spanish-style houses. Most of the homes in the neighborhood, developed from 1921 to 1930, are mission style, but nearly every style is represented. There are many Mediterranean revival-style houses along the high ridge line. Only two buildings in the historic district are known to have been designed by architects: 701 Flamingo Drive designed by Harvey and Clarke, and the Armory Arts Center designed by William Manly King. The neighborhood became a West Palm Beach historic district in January 1993 and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

'''[[Grandview Heights Historic District|Grandview Heights]]''': One of the city's oldest neighborhoods still intact, Grandview Heights was built as an extension of Palm Beach Heights from around 1910 to 1925. Almost all of Palm Beach Heights and half of Grandview Heights was demolished in 1989 to make way for the proposed Downtown/Uptown project, which became CityPlace. Grandview Heights originally attracted construction workers who helped build the luxury hotels, ministers and store owners. The neighborhood has one of the city's best collection of early craftsman-style bungalows, as well as some modest, Mediterranean revival-style homes. The neighborhood became a West Palm Beach historic district in 1995 and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.<ref name=":2" />

'''[[Mango Promenade Historic District|Mango Promenade]]''': Mango Promenade became a West Palm Beach historic district in 1995 and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Lies just south of Palm Beach Atlantic University.

'''Northboro Park''': An expansion of Old Northwood, Northboro Park was mostly custom houses for upper-middle-class professionals. Most of the houses are Mediterranean revival, mission and frame vernacular. Developed from 1923 to 1940, the neighborhood became the city's second historic district (November 1992) and the historic designation may soon expand north to 45th Street. The oldest building in the neighborhood is Northboro Elementary School at 36th Street and Spruce, built in 1925 by DaCamara and Chace. The demolition of Northboro Elementary School began in late 2009. The first home in Northboro Park is 418 36th St., built in 1923.

'''[[Northwest Historic District|Northwest]]''': West Palm Beach's first historic district to be included on the National Register of Historic Places (February 1992), the Northwest neighborhood was first settled in 1894, when the black community was moved from the Styx in Palm Beach to West Palm Beach. It also served as the city's segregated black community from 1929 to 1960 (along with Pleasant City). Northwest remains a predominantly black community but according to the city planning department, most middle- and upper-class blacks moved to other neighborhoods after desegregation. Tamarind and Rosemary Avenues were the commercial centers for blacks by 1915, but most commercial buildings have been demolished or remodeled so the architecture is no longer significant. There are still good examples of late 19th- and early 20th-century American bungalow/craftsman-style homes in this neighborhood, which also has mission, shotgun, Bahamian vernacular and American Foursquare styles. The Alice Frederick Mickens house, at 801 Fourth St., is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Mickens was a philanthropist and humanitarian who promoted education for black youth. Another notable house is the [[Gwen Cherry]] house at 625 Division Ave. Cherry, Florida's first Black woman legislator and a resident of Miami, inherited the house from relative Mollie Holt, who built the house in 1926. Now it is the Palm Beach County Black Historical Society. The Northwest neighborhood was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. The next year the neighborhood became a West Palm Beach historic district in 1993.

'''[[Old Northwood Historic District]]''': Old Northwood was developed from 1920 to 1927—the height of the city's real estate boom. The Pinewood Development Co., platted and developed the area. Old Northwood became a neighborhood of what was considered extravagant Mediterranean revival, mission and frame vernacular houses, at $30,000 to $36,000. The buyers were professionals, entrepreneurs and tradesmen. Among them was David F. Dunkle, who was mayor of West Palm Beach. There are houses here designed by notable architects John Volk (best known for his Palm Beach houses), William Manly King (who designed Palm Beach High School and the Armory Arts Center) and Henry Steven Harvey (whose Seaboard Railroad Passenger Station on Tamarind Avenue is listed in the National Register of Historic Places). The neighborhood became a West Palm Beach historic district in 1991 and listed in the National Register of Historic Places in June 1994.

'''Northwood Hills Historic District''': On August 4, 2003, the City Commission designated the Northwood Hills neighborhood as the 13th Historic District in the City of West Palm Beach. Northwood Hills comprises the area from 29th Street on the South to 39th Court on the North. The east side of Windsor is the Western boundary, and Greenwood Avenue is the Eastern boundary.<ref name=":3" /> The Neighborhood Association has worked several years to achieve the distinction of historic designation. This is the first district to be designated since 1996. Northwood Hills has a number of Mission Revival houses, a significant collection of Post-World War II architecture, a unique street layout, and one of the highest elevations in the city. The Northwood Hills neighborhood has also elected to allow the establishment of Bed and Breakfast establishments within the neighborhood.

'''Prospect Park''': Promoted as a [[high-end]] neighborhood patterned after the prominent Prospect Park district in Brooklyn, this area consisted of mostly smaller estates for prominent businesspeople and northern investors. The neighborhood has a high concentration of Mediterranean revival and Mission revival houses. It was developed from 1920 to 1935 and became a city historic district in November 1993.

'''West Northwood Historic District''': Cashing in on the real estate boom, developers of West Northwood built speculative and custom houses for upper-middle-class professionals from 1925 to '27. Dominant architectural styles are Mediterranean revival and mission. Although the area was declining, that has reversed in recent years, as more investors buy and restore the houses. West Northwood became a city historic district in August 1993.

====West Palm Beach Census Designated Places and Urbanized Area====
The estimated 2012 population of West Palm Beach and the immediately adjacent Census Designated Places is 134,795.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|title=U.S. Census website|first=U.S. Census|last=Bureau|website=[[United States Census Bureau]]}}</ref> Much of this urbanized area lies directly west of the city and includes the neighborhoods of Westgate, Belvedere Homes, Lakeside Green, Century Village, Schall Circle, Lake Belvedere Estates, Plantation Mobile Homes, and Golden Lakes. These neighborhoods are not technically within the boundaries of West Palm Beach, being located in unincorporated Palm Beach County. However, residents possess a "West Palm Beach" address and urban services, such as police, fire, parks, water and sewer, are provided by a combination of Palm Beach County and the City of West Palm Beach in these areas. The City of West Palm Beach also provides water and sewer service to the Town of Palm Beach. The contiguous "urbanized" area, of which West Palm Beach is the core city, includes most of eastern Palm Beach County and has an estimated 2008 population of around 1,250,000.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|url=http://www.bebr.ufl.edu/population|title=Population Studies Program - www.bebr.ufl.edu|access-date=July 4, 2016}}</ref>

===Climate===
West Palm Beach has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Af)'' with mean temperatures in all months above {{convert|18|°C|1|order=flip}}. The city is situated in USDA [[hardiness zone]] 10b, with an annual mean minimum temperature of {{convert|37.7|°F|0}}.

There is year-round rainfall, with the majority falling in a wet season from May through October that is hot and humid. The average window for {{convert|90|°F|0}} temperatures is April 15 through October 10, but temperatures of {{convert|100|°F|0}} or higher have only occurred four times since record-keeping began in 1888. During this period, more than half of the days bring afternoon thunderstorms and sea breezes that cool the air for the rest of the day. Late in the season, there is also a chance for a tropical storm or hurricane to strike. The area was unusually hard-hit in 2004 and 2005, when Hurricanes [[Hurricane Frances|Frances]], [[Hurricane Jeanne|Jeanne]] and [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]] caused property damage and power outages.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kleinberg |first1=Eliot |title=Remembering the hurricanes of 2004's "Mean Season" |url=https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/local/2019/08/29/post-time-remembering-hurricanes-of-2004s-mean-season/4354684007/ |website=Palm Beach Post |access-date=4 September 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Wilma |url=https://www.weather.gov/mfl/wilma |website=National Weather Service |publisher=National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration |access-date=4 September 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Frances |url=https://www.weather.gov/mfl/frances |website=National Weather Service}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Jeanne |url=https://www.weather.gov/mfl/jeanne |website=National Weather Service |access-date=4 September 2022}}</ref>

Although it lacks a fully [[dry season]], the period from November through April is warm and drier, with {{convert|80|°F|0}} temperatures remaining fairly commonplace even from December through February. Occasionally, a stronger cold front can lower daytime temperatures to around {{convert|57|°F|0}}, the annual mean minimum max temperature, and lows to around {{convert|38|°F|0}}. Freezes are rare; the most recent was in 2010. This dry season can also bring about potential for drought during hotter, drier seasons.

'''Violent crime''': According to Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) statistics, West Palm Beach is experiencing a steep drop in major crimes. In the past decade, crime has dropped more in West Palm Beach than in any other major city (approximately 100,000 residents or more) in the state of Florida. In 1993, West Palm Beach was featured in a [[60 Minutes]] segment on urban decay. At the time, 80% of downtown properties were vacant. Since then, the city has done much to improve its image, at least in the physical sense. Occupancy is high, and housing prices have risen rapidly. FDLE stats show that the total crime rate per 100,000 residents has dropped by more than 50% since 2000, from 13,880 that year to 6,571 in 2008. In 2008 alone, there was a 17.9% drop in crime. Annual crime rates are always more than three times the national average. However, as of 2006, the city's crime average has been gradually decreasing while robbery was up 17 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/city/West-Palm-Beach-Florida.html |title=West Palm Beach, Florida (FL) Detailed Profile - relocation, real estate, travel, jobs, hospitals, schools, crime, news, sex offenders |publisher=City-data.com |access-date=2010-11-28}}</ref> West Palm Beach's northern neighbor, [[Riviera Beach, Florida|Riviera Beach]], has an even higher violent crime rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.areaconnect.com/crime/compare.htm?c1=west+palm+beach&s1=FL&c2=riviera+beach&s2=FL |title=Crime Rate Comparison: West Palm Beach Vs.
