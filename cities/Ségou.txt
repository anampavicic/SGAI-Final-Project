'''Ségou''' ({{IPA|fr|seɡu}}; {{lang-bm|ߛߋߜ߭ߎ߫|italic=no}}, {{lang|bm-Latn|Segu}}) is a town and an [[Communes of Mali|urban commune]] in south-central [[Mali]] that lies {{convert|235|km|mi}} northeast of [[Bamako]] on the right bank of the [[River Niger]]. The town is the capital of the [[Ségou Cercle]] and the [[Ségou Region]]. With 130,690 inhabitants in 2009, it is the fifth-largest town in Mali. 

In the middle of the 19th century there were four villages with the name of Ségou spread out over a distance of around {{cvt|12|km}} along the right bank of the river. They were, starting from the most upstream, Ségou-Koro (Old Ségou), Ségou-Bougou, Ségou-Koura (New Ségou) and Ségou-Sikoro. The present town is on the site of Ségou-Sikoro.{{sfn|Triaud|1997|p=121}}{{sfn|Mage|1868|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/voyagedanslesoud00mage#page/207/mode/1up 207-208]}}

==History==
===Origin===
Ségou has contested origins. Some claim that the word Ségou come from "Sikoro", meaning to the foot of a [[Vitellaria|shea butter tree]]. Others argue that it was named after Cheikou, a [[marabout]] who founded the city, while still other theories support the claim that Ségou was founded by the Bozo fishermen coming from the north in the 4th century, who established their villages along the Niger River. The 11th century CE saw an influx of the [[Soninke people]], who were trying to escape from the collapse of the [[Ghana Empire]], with [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] populations following.{{cn|date = October 2024}}
[[File:Tombe Biton Coulibaly.jpg|left|thumbnail|250px|Tomb of [[Biton Mamary Coulibaly]] at Ségou-Koro]]
===Bambara Empire===
Around 1650 [[Kaladian Coulibaly]] overthrew the ruling Koita dynasty and established a powerful if short-lived kingdom with Ségou-Koro as capital.<ref name= "EAHC">{{cite book |last1=Page |first1=Willie F. |editor1-last=Davis |editor1-first=R.

One of Koulibaly's great-grandsons, [[Mamary Coulibaly]], also known as Bitòn, became the chief of his ''tòn'', an association of men, sometime after 1700. By 1712, Bitòn had used his military strength to displace local elders and expand the [[Bambara Empire]]. In the subsequent decades, he expanded its territory to encompass regional commerce centers such as [[Macina, Mali|Macina]] and [[Djenné]]. The city of [[Timbuktu]] would become a [[tributary state]] to Bitòn's Bambara Empire.<ref name="Bortolot" /> At this time Segou was capital of the Bambara Empire,<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Ségou {{!}} Mali {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Segou-Mali |access-date=2023-02-06 |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |language=en}}</ref>{{sfn|Tamari|1991|p=233}} and a distinct urban architecture began to emerge at Ségou Koro, including [[Mosque|mosques]].<ref name="Bortolot">{{cite web |last=Bortolot |first=Alexander Ives |date=October 2003 |title=The Bamana Ségou State |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bama_1/hd_bama_1.htm |access-date=2023-02-05 |website=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]}}</ref>

After Bitòn's death in 1755 a period of instability followed, during which the capital of the Empire moved repeatedly.<ref name=Tauxier/>{{sfn|MacDonald|2012|p=355, 359}} In 1766 [[Ngolo Diarra]], a former slave and warrior, took control the Bambara Empire and inaugurated a period of prosperity. The Diarra dynasty ruled Ségou until the mid-19th century.<ref name= "EAHC"/><ref name="Bortolot" /> He moved the kingdom's capital from Segou-Koro to Ségou-Sikoro, close to the site of the current city.<ref name=Tauxier/>

[[Mungo Park (explorer)|Mungo Park]], passing through Segou in 1797 recorded a testament to the Empire's prosperity:
{{quote|The view of this extensive city, the numerous canoes on the river, the crowded population, and the cultivated state of the surrounding countryside, formed altogether a prospect of civilization and magnificence that I little expected to find in the bosom of Africa.<ref>{{harvnb|Park|1799|p=[https://archive.org/details/travelsininteri02renngoog/page/n246 196]}}, quoted in {{cite book |last=Davidson |first=Basil |author-link=Basil Davidson |title=Africa in History |location=New York |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1995 |isbn=0-684-82667-4 |page=245 }}</ref>}}

=== French colonial rule ===
France attempted indirectly ruling Ségou until March 13, 1893, when they incorporated the town as the capital of a local ''[[Cercles of Mali|cercle]]''.{{sfn|USAID|2008|p=2}} Ségou continued to serve as a regional commercial center throughout French rule.{{sfn|USAID|2008|p=2}}

==Geography==

=== Location ===
Ségou is situated {{Convert|235|km|mi}} from [[Bamako]], on the right bank of the [[Niger River]].{{sfn|USAID|2008|p=2}} The [[Communes of Mali|urban commune]] is bordered to the east by the commune of [[Pelengana]], to the west by the commune of [[Sébougou]] and to the south by the commune of [[Sakoïba]].{{sfn|USAID|2008|p=2}}

The commune is subdivided into 15 ''quartiers'': Alamissani, Angoulême, Bagadadji, Bougoufié, Comatex, Dar Salam, Hamdallaye, Médine, Mission Catholique, Missira, Ségou Coura, Sido Soninkoura, Somono, Sokalakono, Bananissabakoro.{{sfn|USAID|2008|p=3}}

===Climate===
Ségou has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSh''). The city is irrigated by two important waterways: the Niger and the [[Bani River]]. Ségou has two seasons: a rainy season and a dry season. The rainy season starts in June and lasts about four months until September. Ségou's dry season includes a relatively mild period followed by a period of sweltering heat. The average yearly rainfall is about {{convert|640|mm|in|0|disp=or}}. The [[harmattan]] is the dominant wind in the dry season and it blows from north to south. The monsoon blowing from south to north-west is frequent during rainy season (''hivernage'').

==Demography==
As of the 2009 Mali Census, Ségou has a population of 130,690, up from 105,305 in 1998.<ref name=":0" /> A 2007 estimate put the city's population at 118,814.{{sfn|USAID|2008|p=3}}

The population of the [[Ségou Region]] is largely rural, and nomadic semi-sedentary or sedentary. The population consists of many [[ethnic]] groups, such as [[Bambara people|Bambara]], Bozo, [[Fula people|Fulani]], [[Soninke people|Soninke]], [[Mandinka people|Malinke]] and [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleur]].

The town of Ségou itself is home to a variety of ethnic groups, including the Malinke, the Soninke, the Fulani, and the Toucouleur, due to its complex history and status as a regional commercial center.{{sfn|Tamari|1991|p=225}}

Bambaras are mostly farmers and are the most numerous ethnic group.{{Citation needed|date=February 2023}} Their language is Bambara or [[Djoula]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2023}} The Bozos are the second most populous ethnic group.{{Citation needed|date=February 2023}} They typically live near the shore of the Niger river, in small towns of small houses.{{Citation needed|date=February 2023}} The Bozo economy is based on fishing.{{Citation needed|date=February 2023}} Bozo people have a monopoly on the transport system because of their knowledge of the Niger, its shallows and seasonal lakes, and are regarded as the masters of water.{{Citation needed|date=February 2023}} The {{ill|Somono|fr|Somono}}, a group known to specialize in fishing and boating, are largely concentrated in Ségou and its surroundings.{{sfn|Tamari|1991|p=231}} The [[Mandinka people|Malinké/Mandinka/Manink]]<nowiki/>a are closely related to Bambaras: They share costumes, religious beliefs, and practices with the Bambaras.{{Citation needed|date=February 2023}} The [[Marka people|Marka]], [[Saracollé]] or [[Soninke people|Soninke]] are merchants and warriors.{{Citation needed|date=February 2023}} The Soninke people are great travelers and Muslims, and have largely conserved their traditions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2023}}

==Art and culture==
The Bambaras used to transmit their knowledge by oral tradition, hence much of their art and culture is unknown. Ségou's cultural heritage includes traditional musical instruments, wonderful [[griot]]s, folkloric groups and the traditional masks and marionettes. The history of the Bambara state's traditional religious practices are ambiguous. They practice animism and fetishism as cultural practices, and also totemic and monism (cult of ancestors). The most famous Ségou handcrafts are based on pottery, weaving (blankets, wrappers and carpets), manufacturing of ''Bogolan'' (a distinctive variation of [[Mud cloth]]), painting and sculpture. Ségou is also regarded as the capital of Malian pottery with a large pottery district in [[Kalabougou]] situated on the left bank. Women make the pottery by hand with the clay coming from the Niger River and bring the finished works to the local Monday market.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

==Architecture==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2023}}
Ségou has two architectural styles: [[French Colonial]] and traditional [[Sudano-Sahelian|Sudanese]] and neo-Sudanese. The Sudanese style influenced public building and important residences. Monuments and great mosques are also built according to this style. Many of [[Sudano-Sahelian]]'s kings built imposing palaces in the cities over which they ruled and most of these buildings are in red clay. The materials used for building are generally quite poor and many of the buildings need to be restored to maintain their state.

==Economy==
Today, Ségou is known for its pottery, its market and its fishing industry.  Attractions in the old town of ''Ségou-Koro'' included a mosque, Coulibaly's tomb and an ancient tree.  In the city center, the main landmark is the [[water tower]].

The most important economic activities are fishing, cattle herding and small scale farming. [[Millet]] is the main crop in Ségou, with other major cereals including [[Sorghum bicolor|sorghum]], and [[cowpea]].{{sfn|USAID|2008|p=4}} The main type of millet crop is [[rice]] [[pearl millet]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2023}} [[Black-eyed pea]]s are also grown.{{Citation needed|date=February 2023}} Crop yields in Ségou are generally low.{{sfn|USAID|2008|p=4}} Common types of livestock in Ségou includes [[sheep]], [[poultry]], [[cattle]], [[Goat|goats]], and [[Donkey|donkeys]].{{sfn|USAID|2008|p=4}} Both artisanal and commercial fishing are practiced in Ségou.{{sfn|USAID|2008|p=4}} Men often do the fishing, while women usually market the fish.{{sfn|USAID|2008|p=4}}

While most consumer goods are imported into Ségou, the city produces, and exports, handicraft and agricultural products.{{sfn|USAID|2008|p=5}}

As of 2008, the town is served by two telecom operators: [[Ikatel]] and [[Sotelma]].{{sfn|USAID|2008|p=6}}

There are two factories processing cotton: Compagnie Malienne des Textiles (COMATEX) and [[Compagnie malienne pour le développement du textile]] (CMDT). Commerce consists mostly of the small scale exchange and sale of products from the primary sector, sold weekly at the large Sudano-Sahelian market, drawing customers from far outside of the city. The main products sold are vegetables, pottery, cotton, leather, fruit, ovens, cattle and cereals.

The headquarters of the [[Office du Niger]] is based in the town.<ref name=":0" /> The Office du Niger is a semi-autonomous government agency that administers a large irrigation scheme in the Ségou Region to the north of the Niger River.{{sfn|Schreyger|2002|pp=68-73}}

Ségou used to be served by [[Ségou Airport]] ([[IATA airport code|IATA]]: SZU, [[ICAO airport code|ICAO]]: GASG). The airport lay south-west of the city center and is visible on old maps as well as satellite imagery.<ref>{{Cite web|last=U.S. Army Map Service|date=1961|title=Joint Operations Graphic (Air) ND 29-12|url=http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/jog/west_africa/nd-29-12-segou-mali.pdf}}</ref>
