Located below [[Mount Meru (Tanzania)|Mount Meru]] on the eastern edge of the eastern branch of the [[East African Rift|Great Rift Valley]], Arusha City has a temperate climate. The city is close to the [[Serengeti National Park]], the [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]], [[Lake Manyara National Park]], [[Olduvai Gorge]], [[Tarangire National Park]], [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], and [[Mount Meru (Tanzania)|Mount Meru]] in the [[Arusha National Park]].  

The city is a major international diplomatic hub.

==History==
[[File:clock tower May 1953.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Arusha clock tower area, 1953.]]
[[File:Arusha Clocktower.jpg|thumb|right|The Arusha clock tower in the Central Business Area of Arusha City, 2005.]]
The current site of Arusha was first settled in the 1830s by the agro-pastoral Arusha [[Maasai people|Maasai]] from the [[Arusha Chini]] community, south of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]].<ref name="Strangers">[https://books.google.com/books?id=0IwMwBVfr0sC "'A Town of Strangers' or a 'Model Modern East African Town'? Arusha & the Arusha", authored by Thomas Spear, in ''Africa's Urban Past'', edited by David Anderson and Richard Rathbone, James Currey Publishers, 2000; accessed 31 October 2014.]</ref>{{rp|page 112}} They traded grains, honey, beer, and tobacco with the pastoral [[Kisongo]] [[Maasai people|Maasai]] in exchange for livestock, milk, meat, and skins. Demand for Arusha's foodstuffs increased substantially during the 1860s when the [[Pangani River|Pangani Valley]] trade route was extended through Old Moshi, Arusha, and ultimately to western Kenya.<ref name="Strangers"/>{{rp|page 112}} Although not yet a town, it was a regional centre with  a number of urban features.{{clarify|date=September 2022}}<ref name="Strangers"/>{{rp|page 113}}

Arusha was conquered by the Germans in 1896 after the murder of the first two missionaries who attempted to settle on nearby [[Mount Meru (Tanzania)|Mount Meru]]. The Germans established a permanent presence in 1900 when a military fort (a ''boma'') was built and soldiers were garrisoned there.<ref name="Strangers"/>{{rp|page 113}} "The ''boma'' was a solid statement, meant to impress German moral and political order on the surrounding countryside. Set on a rise overlooking the plains, the fortress-like building dominated the surrounding landscape" complete with a machine gun.<ref name="Strangers"/>{{rp|page 113}} 

Many Africans were forcibly displaced from their ancestral lands by the Germans and forced to dig lime or carry stones to construct the fort. The British took Arusha from the Germans in 1916 during [[World War I]]. German officials left the area, the British deported German missionaries and settlers, and only a skeletal military administration of the town remained.<ref name="Strangers"/>{{rp|page 114}} 

During the 1920s, civilian administration was implemented, missionaries from the United States arrived, British and Greek settlers reoccupied the former German farms, and the town grew, especially after the British moved the regional administration from New Moshi to Arusha. The extension of the railroad from Moshi to Arusha in 1928-29 greatly increased commerce.<ref name="Strangers"/>{{rp|page 114}} The [[Great Depression]] soon squelched commerce and Arusha in 1940 had fewer than 2,000 residents. Growth resumed during [[World War II]] and by 1948, the population had increased to more than 5,000.<ref name="Strangers"/>{{rp|page 115}} 

By the 1950s, Arusha was "a [[polyglot]], westernized little town; it has a Greek community, several Germans predating World War I, and some [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jewish]] refugees post-dating World War II."<ref name="Gunter">{{cite book

Journalist [[John Gunther]] noted at the time that "a loyal tribe, the Waarusha, threatened to take violent countermeasures against the Kikuyus themselves, if the British did not. The authorities arrested the leading Mau Mau conspirators, screened thousands more, and deported other thousands back to Kenya."<ref name="Gunter" />

In the 1960s, parts of the movie ''[[Hatari!]]'' with [[John Wayne]] were filmed at [[Momela Lakes]] and at [[Mount Meru (Tanzania)|Mount Meru]].

Arusha has been a crucial city in the history of modern Tanzania. Official documents ceding independence to [[Tanganyika (1961–1964)|Tanganyika]] were signed by the United Kingdom at Arusha in 1961. The [[Arusha Declaration]] was signed in 1967 in Arusha. The [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|Arusha Accords]] were signed at the city of Arusha on 4 August 1993, by representatives of competing factions in the Rwandan civil war.{{cn|date=September 2022}}

The Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement for [[Burundi]] was signed on 28 August 2000 as part of a process forging peace in that country through power sharing and establishing a transitional government.{{cn|date=September 2022}} 

The January 2015 Arusha Agreement for South Sudan created a framework for the reunification of South Sudan's ruling SPLM party, which had splintered into three creating a humanitarian crisis as fighting between factions intensified. It provided that all SPLM members who were dismissed be reinstated to their previous positions and a secret ballot system be adopted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/news/east-africa/south-sudan-peace-faces-new-challenges-1350138|title=South Sudan peace faces new challenges|last=Oduha|first=Joseph|date=19 May 2016|work=[[The EastAfrican]]|access-date=22 October 2024}}</ref>

In 1994, the UN Security Council decided by its [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 955|Resolution 955]] of 8 November 1994 that Arusha should host the ''ad hoc'' [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]]. The establishment of the tribunal with its foreign employees has influenced the local economy of the city increasing the cost of living for residents. The tribunal has downsized due to its closure in 2014, but its legal successor, the United Nations [[International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals]] established by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1966]], will continue entertaining a branch in Arusha, opening on 1 July 2012. The tribunal indicted 93 individuals and sentenced 62.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unictr.irmct.org/en/tribunal|title=The ICTR in Brief &#124; United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda}}</ref>

==Geography and climate==
{{Moresources|section|date=September 2022}}
Despite its proximity to the [[equator]], Arusha's elevation of {{convert|1400|m}} on the southern slopes of Mount Meru keeps temperatures relatively low and alleviates humidity. Cool dry air is prevalent for much of the year. The temperature typically ranges between {{convert|10|and|30|C|F}} with an average annual high temperature around {{convert|25|C|F|disp=or}}. It has distinct wet and dry seasons, and experiences an eastern prevailing wind from the [[Indian Ocean]], a few hundred kilometres east. Under the [[Köppen climate classification]] system, it has a [[subtropical highland climate]] (''Cwb''). Areas away from Arusha to the south and west are classified as [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'').

Arusha's annual rainfall average is {{convert|1180|mm|in|2}}, mostly coming during the long rainy season from March to May. Areas immediately to the north and northeast of Arusha can see more rain and cooler temperatures due to the influence of Mt. Meru, whose rain shadow extends toward the southeast side of the mountain.
[[File:Arusha, Tanzania (Explored) - Flickr - romanboed.jpg|thumb|A street in Arusha town.]]
Arusha and the northern highlands of Tanzania experience a bimodal rainfall pattern, with two rainy seasons. Many crops are planted twice per year. The long ''masika'' rains from March through May are more reliable in Arusha than in surrounding areas because of the influence of Mt. Meru. The short ''vuli'' rains are less reliable, usually coming in November and December. The dry ''kiangazi'' season is June to October. 

Higher elevation areas north and northeast of the city are home to farmers growing bananas, coffee, cabbage, potatoes, carrots, leafy greens, and other vegetables.

Cultivation in areas to the northwest, west, southwest, south, and southeast focuses on maize, beans and wheat. There is a significant horticulture industry, with several companies growing flowers for export to Europe.
