'''Debre Tabor''' ({{lang-am|ደብረ ታቦር}}, <small>lit.</small>&nbsp;"Mount Tabor") is a  town and [[woreda]] in northern [[Ethiopia]]. Located in the [[Debub Gondar Zone]] of the [[Amhara Region]], about 100 kilometers southeast of [[Gondar]] and 50 kilometers east of [[Lake Tana]], this historic town has a latitude and longitude of {{coord|11|51|N|38|1|E}} with an elevation of {{convert|2706|m|ft}} above sea level. The presence of at least 48 [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] in the area contributed to the development of Debre Tabor.

Debre Tabor is served by an [[Debre Tabor Airport|airport]] ([[ICAO]] code HADT, [[IATA]] DBT). 

==History==

=== Origin ===
Authorities differ over the facts of its founding. Locals say [[Sons of Yagbe'u Seyon|Seyfa Ared IV]] ([[Amharic language|Amharic]]: ሰይፈ አርድ ፬ኛ) (1294–1295) discovered '''Debre''' '''Tabor''' in the 13th century. Mordechai Abir states that it was founded by [[Ali I of Yejju|Ras Ali I]];<ref>Mordechai Abir, ''Ethiopia: Era of the Princes'' (London: Longmans, 1968), p. 30.</ref> however, [[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]] gives a detailed account of its foundation by [[Gugsa of Yejju|Ras Gugsa]], and includes the tradition that the location was selected with supernatural help.<ref>Richard P. K. Pankhurst, ''History of Ethiopian Towns'' (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1982), p. 265.</ref> In either case, Debre Tabor was the seat of the Regents of the [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] in the 18th and 19th centuries, from which periods several [[Church (building)|churches]] and the ruins of two [[palace]]s survive. Debre Tabor was the capital of Ethiopia under two [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperors]]: [[Tewodros II of Ethiopia|Tewodros II]] and [[Yohannes IV of Ethiopia|Yohannes IV]]. As a result, in the 19th century the population of this town varied depending on whether the emperor was in residence. If he was present, the population could reach 30,000 as it did under Emperor Yohannes; if he was not, it would be around 5,000 people.<ref>Richard P. K. Pankhurst, ''An Economic History of Ethiopia, 1800-1935'' (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University Press, 1968), p. 694.</ref>

=== 19th century ===
Debre Tabor was sacked by an army from the province of [[Lasta]] in 1835.<ref>Pankhurst, ''Ethiopian Towns'', p. 266.</ref> The [[Battle of Debre Tabor]] was fought nearby on February 6, 1842; although Dejazmach [[Wube Haile Maryam]] and his allies defeated the armies of Ras [[Ali II of Yejju|Ali II]] and sacked Debre Tabor once again, they were surprised while celebrating their victory by [[Birru Aligas]], an ally of Ras Ali, who captured Wube and his son and extracted concessions from them in return for their release.<ref>Abir, ''Era of Princes'', pp. 111f; Pankhurst, ''Ethiopian Towns'', p. 268.</ref>

Ras Ali built four churches in Debre Tabor: Iyasus on the mountain to the southeast, Ennatitu Maryam and Legitu Maryam to the east, and Tegur Mikael to the north. A second palace was built for his mother, the Empress [[Menen Liben Amede]], which was not as large as Ras Ali's.<ref>Pankhurst, ''Ethiopian Towns'', pp. 271ff.</ref>

Although he burnt the town in May 1853, following Ras Ali's defeat, Emperor [[Tewodros II of Ethiopia|Tewodros]] used Debre Tabor as his capital until his situation weakened so badly that he was forced to abandon the town in the last year of his reign in 1867  for his stronghold on [[Maqdala]].<ref>Sven Rubenson, ''King of Kings: Tewodros of Ethiopia'' (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University, 1966), pp. 43, 82</ref> The Emperor [[Yohannes IV of Ethiopia|Yohannes IV]] often resided at Debre Tabor, and during his reign Heruy Giyorgis church was built. Here the Emperor met with General [[Charles George Gordon|Gordon]] in October 1878, who was representing the Egyptian government, about Ethiopian demands for access to the [[Red Sea]]. It was also in Debre Tabor that [[Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam|Tekle Haymanot]] was crowned [[Negus]] of [[Gojjam]] in January 1881.<ref name="NAI-web">[http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/d/ORTDEB2.pdf "Local History in Ethiopia"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227131228/http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/d/ORTDEB2.pdf |date=2008-02-27 }} (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 9 May 2008)</ref>

=== 20th century ===
When the [[Bank of Ethiopia]] was created in 1931 it opened a branch office with two employees at Debre Tabor. During the [[Second Italian-Abyssinian War]], Debre Tabor was occupied by unit which advanced from [[Bahir Dar]] on 28 April. During the [[Italian East Africa|occupation]], a telegraph office was opened in the town and postal service restored. The Italians also constructed a road from [[Gondar]] via Debre Tabor to [[Dessie]]. The first mosque in Debre Tabor was constructed and [[eucalyptus]] planting extended. Despite these improvements, as early as August 1937, there were almost simultaneous but apparently uncoordinated attacks by ''[[Freedom fighter|arbegnoch]]'' on garrisons near Debre Tabor and near Bahir Dar. After several months of attacks, the British convinced Colonel Angelini to surrender the town 6 July 1941, allowing the British to advance towards the organized Italian resistance around Gondar under the command of [[Guglielmo Nasi]], who by this point was the acting Viceroy and Governor-General of [[Italian East Africa]].<ref name="NAI-web"/>

In 1958, Debre Tabor was one of 27 places in Ethiopia ranked as First Class Township.<ref name="NAI-web"/>

Near the beginning of [[Derg]] rule, Debre Tabor was seized by a group of local landlords and their followers in opposition to the government September 1975, killing the provincial governor and expelling both a Chinese road-building team and missionaries of the Seventh Day Adventist Church who ran a local hospital. Government control was reestablished within a month.<ref name="NAI-web"/>

In late December 1989, [[Tigray People's Liberation Front]] (TPLF) forces captured Debre Tabor, claiming that they killed or wounded more than 8,000 government troops. Around 20 January 1990, the [[Ethiopian News Agency]] announced that government forces had recaptured Debre Tabor. A few days later, the clandestine radio of the TPLF claimed a major victory in battles near Debre Tabor on 22–24 January 1990, claiming their soldiers had killed 3,914 government troops and captured 270. Although the town was retaken by government troops  a few days later, the TPLF, announced the recapture of the town after a three-day battle in late February.<ref name="NAI-web"/> About a year later, on 23 February 1990, the town was used as the jumping-off point for [[Operation Tewodros]].<ref>Gebru Tareke notes that this military action "has come to be known as the second battle of Debre Tabor" despite the fact it "was not one big, decisive engagement but a series of skirmishes." (''The Ethiopian Revolution: War in the Horn of Africa'' [New Haven: Yale University, 2009], p. 302)</ref>

=== 21st century ===
In early August 2021, Debre Tabor was the site of fierce clashes between [[Fano (militia)|Fano]] militiamen and the [[Ethiopian National Defense Force]] (ENDF).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Endeshaw |first1=Dawit |title=Ethiopian military clashes with militia in Amhara, injuries reported |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ethiopian-military-clashes-with-militia-amhara-residents-say-2023-08-02/}}</ref>
