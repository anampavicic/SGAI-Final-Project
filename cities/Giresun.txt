'''Giresun''' ({{IPA|tr|ɟiˈɾesun|pron}}), formerly Cerasus ([[Ancient Greek]]: Κερασοῦς, [[Modern Greek|Greek]]: Κερασούντα), is a city in the [[Black Sea Region]] of northeastern Turkey, about {{convert|175|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of the city of [[Trabzon]]. It is the seat of [[Giresun Province]] and [[Giresun District]].<ref name=il>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx İl Belediyesi], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory. Retrieved 1 March 2023.</ref> It has a population of 125,682 (2022).<ref name=tuik>{{Cite web |title=Address-based population registration system (ADNKS) results dated 31 December 2022, Favorite Reports|url=https://biruni.tuik.gov.tr/medas/?kn=95&locale=en |access-date=13 March 2023|publisher=[[TÜİK]]|language=en|format=XLS}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Giresun was known to the ancient Greeks as ''Choerades'' or more prominently as '''Kerasous''' or '''Cerasus''' ({{langx|grc|Κερασοῦς}}), the origin of the modern name.

The name Kerasous consists of the Greek words κερασός (kerasós) "[[cherry]]" + -ουντ (a place marker).<ref name="Beekes2010">{{cite book|author=Robert S. P. Beekes|author-link=Robert S. P. Beekes|title=Etymological Dictionary of Greek|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CltlewAACAAJ|year=2010|publisher=Brill|quote=As the improved cherry came from the Pontos area (cf. Κερασοῦς "rich in cherries", town on the Pontos), the name is probably Anatolian as well. Given its intervocalic σ, the form must be Anatolian or Pre-Greek. For the suffix, cf. ▶-θíασος, ▶-κάρπασος, which too are of foreign origin. Assyr. karšu has also been adduced. Cf. on ▶κράνον 'cornelian cherry'. Gr. κέρασος, -íα, κεράσιον were borrowed into many languages: Asiatic names of the cherry-tree and the cherry, like Arm. ker̄as, Kurd. ghilas, and in the West, Lat. cerasus, -ium, VLat. ★cerasia, ★ceresia, -ea; from Latin came the Romance and Germanic forms like MoFr. cerise, OHG chirsa > Kirsche. Lit.: Olck in PW 11: 509f. and Hester Lingua 13 (1965): 356.|isbn=978-90-04-17418-4}}</ref> Thus, the Greek root of the word "cherry", κερασός (kerasós), predates the name of the city,<ref name="Beekes2010" /> and the ultimate origin of the word cherry (and thus the name of the city) is probably from a [[Pre-Greek substrate]], likely of [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian origin]], given the intervocalic σ in Κερασοῦς and the apparent cognates of it found in other languages of the region.<ref name="Beekes2010" /> According to [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], the [[cherry]] was first exported from Cerasus to Europe in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times by [[Lucullus]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Pliny the Elder |title=[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]] ''15.30'' |chapter=Olives, olive-oil and fruit-trees |quote=Before the victory of [[Lucullus|Lucius Lucullus]] in the war against Mithridates, that is down to 74 BC, there were no cherry-trees in Italy. Lucullus first imported them from Pontus... |author-link=Pliny the Elder |chapter-url=http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm#BOOK%20XV |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101063545/http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm#BOOK%20XV |archive-date=2017-01-01 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Another theory suggests that Kerasous comes from κέρας (keras) "horn" + -ουντ (a place marker), due to the prominent horn-shaped peninsula that the city is situated on (compare with the Greek name for the horn-shaped [[Golden Horn]] waterway in Istanbul, Κέρας (Keras) "Horn").<ref name="Öztürk2005">{{cite book|author=Özhan Öztürk|author-link=Özhan Öztürk|url=http://www.karalahana.com/english/ENCYCLOPEDIC%20DICTIONARY%20OF%20BLACKSEA.html|title=Karadeniz: Ansiklopedik Sözlük|trans-title=Black Sea: Encyclopedic Dictionary|publisher=Heyamola Publishing|location=Istanbul|year=2005|isbn=975-6121-00-9|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513094652/http://www.karalahana.com/english/ENCYCLOPEDIC%20DICTIONARY%20OF%20BLACKSEA.html|archive-date=2008-05-13}}</ref> The toponym would have later mutated into ''Kerasunt'' (sometimes written ''Kérasounde'' or ''Kerassunde''), and the word "cherry" (as well as its cognates found in other local languages) was derived from the name of the city itself, rather than the other way around.<ref name="Öztürk2005" />

[[Pharnaces I of Pontus]] renamed the city '''Pharnacia''' after himself after he captured the city in 183 BC, and it was called by that name as late as the 2nd century AD. According to [[A. H. M. Jones]], the city officially reverted to its original name, Kerasous, in 64 AD.<ref>''Arrian: Periplus Ponti Euxini'', edited and translated by Aidan Liddle (London: Bristol Classical Press, 2003), p. 117</ref>

The Greek name Kerasous was Turkified into Giresun ({{langx|ota|گیره‌سون}}) after Turks gained permanent control of the region in the late 14th century.

==Geography==
[[File:Gedikkaya - Giresun.JPG|thumb|Northern end of Gedikkaya crag, located in the eastern part of Giresun city.]]
The surrounding region has rich agriculture, growing most of Turkey's hazelnuts as well as walnuts, cherries, leather and timber, and the port of Giresun has long handled these products. The harbor was enlarged in the 1960s, and the town is still a port and commercial center for the surrounding districts.

Like everywhere else on the [[Black Sea]] coast, it rains (and often snows in winter) and is very humid throughout the year, with a lack of extreme temperatures both in summer and winter. As a result, Giresun and the surrounding countryside are covered with luxuriant flora. Just beyond the city are hazelnut groves, and there are high pastures (''[[plateau|yayla]]'') further in the mountains.

== Climate ==
Giresun has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (Cfa or Cf) under both the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] and [[Trewartha climate classification]]s, with warm, humid summers and cool, damp winters. As a part of the very humid southern Black Sea coast, it experiences frequent precipitation throughout the year, with a small peak in rainfall days in spring and fall. Giresun is the cloudiest city in Turkey, as well as one of the cloudiest cities of the temperate latitudes; with annual sunshine of around 1,000 hours, it is more akin to far northwestern Europe.

[[Snow]]fall is somewhat common between the months of December and March, snowing for a week or two, and it can be heavy once it snows.

The water temperature is cool in winter and warm in summer and fluctuates between 8&nbsp;°C (46&nbsp;°F) and 24&nbsp;°C (75&nbsp;°F) throughout the year.

Giresun was founded circa 180 BC by [[Pharnaces I of Pontus]], who sent Greek citizens from Kotyora (modern [[Ordu]]) to colonize the area.<ref>''[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0006:id=pharnakeia-kerasous The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites]'', PHARNAKEIA KERASOUS (Giresun) Pontus, Turkey</ref> The name of the city was first cited in the book [[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]] by [[Xenophon]] as Kerasus. Historic records reveal that the city was dominated by the [[Milet]]ians, [[Persian Empire|Persians]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Byzantine]]s and the [[Empire of Trebizond]]. The older parts of the city lie on a peninsula crowned by a ruined Byzantine fortress, sheltering the small natural harbor. Nearby is [[Giresun Island]], called ''Aretias'' in ancient times, which is the only major [[Black Sea]] island in Turkish territory. According to legend, the island was sacred to the [[Amazons]], who had dedicated a temple to the war god [[Ares]] here. Even today, fertility rites are performed there every May, usually involving the famed boulder named the [[Hamza Stone]] on the east side of the island, now shrouded as a popular practice but in reality a 4,000-year-old celebration.

Cerasus in late antiquity became a Christian bishopric, and the names of several of its bishops are preserved in the acts of church councils: Gregorius at the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431, Gratianus at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, Theophylactus at the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] in 680, Narses at the [[Trullan Council]] in 692, Ioannes at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787, and Simeon at the [[Photius|Photian]] [[Council of Constantinople (879)|Council of Constantinople]] in 879. An episcopal seal records a Leo of the 9th century, and a Michael was transferred from here to the see of [[Ancyra]] at the time of [[Michael Caerularius]].<ref>Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0agp0mJFG_sC ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. I, coll. 513-516</ref><ref>Raymond Janin, ''v.

During the medieval period, Kerasunt was part of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and later the second city of the [[Empire of Trebizond]] ruled by the Komnenian dynasty. Alexios II Komnenos, Emperor of Trebizond, defeated the Turkmen "Koustoganes" at Kerasunt in September 1302; to secure his victory, Alexios II built a fortress which overlooks the sea.<ref>[[William Miller (historian)|William Miller]], ''Trebizond: The last Greek Empire of the Byzantine Era: 1204-1461'', 1926 (Chicago: Argonaut, 1969), p. 33</ref> From 1244 onwards, the [[Seljuk Turks]] moved into the area, pursued at times by the [[Mongol]] hordes until in 1461, subsequent to the [[Fall of Constantinople]], the whole of this coast was brought within the [[Ottoman Empire]] by Sultan [[Mehmed II]]. It was briefly occupied by Emirate of Hacıemiroğlu (Emirate of [[Chalybia]]) between 1398 and 1400. Local traditions claim that Kerasunt held out for many months after the fall of [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizon]] in 1461, then surrendered on terms that the Christian inhabitants could remain and retain their arms, but were required to maintain a boat for the use of the Turks on a nearby river.<ref>Miller, ''Trebizond'', p. 107</ref>

4.2&nbsp;km east-northeast of Kerasus is a fortified island called Ares (Αρητιας νήσος or Αρεώνησος). According to the poetic account of [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], it was here that the Argonauts encountered both the Amazons and a flock of vicious birds. The Greeks of the island held out against the Ottomans for 7 years after the fall of Trebizond (modern [[Empire of Trebizond|Trabzon]]) in 1461.

Kerasounta became known by its Turkish name Giresun after 1923.

== Demographics ==
Surviving Greeks fled to Greece after the 1923 [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|Population Exchange]] founding villages such as Nea Kerasounta in [[Preveza (regional unit)|Preveza]], [[Greece]].

==Economy==
[[Image:Giresunticaretlisesi.JPG|thumb|Giresun Commerce High School]]
Historically, Giresun was known for producing [[hazelnut]]. As of 1920, hazelnuts covered 460 square miles of the area.
