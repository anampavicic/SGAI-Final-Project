It is located in the [[Canterbury Region]], near the centre of the east coast of the South Island, east of the [[Canterbury Plains]]. It is located near the southern end of [[Pegasus Bay]], and is bounded to the east by the Pacific Ocean and to the south by the ancient volcanic complex of the [[Banks Peninsula]]. The [[Avon River / Ōtākaro|Avon River (Ōtākoro)]] winds through the centre of the city, with [[Hagley Park, Christchurch|a large urban park]] along its banks. With the exception of the Port Hills, it is a relatively flat city, on an average around {{cvt|20|m}} above sea level. Christchurch has a reputation for being an [[English New Zealanders|English]] city, with its architectural identity and nickname the 'Garden City' due to similarities with garden cities in England, but also has a historic [[Māori people|Māori]] heritage. Christchurch has a [[temperate oceanic climate]] with regular moderate rainfall.

The area of modern-day greater Christchurch was first inhabited by the historic Māori [[iwi]] [[Waitaha (South Island iwi)|Waitaha]] in the mid-thirteenth century. Waitaha, who occupied the [[swamp]]lands with patchworks of [[marsh]]land, were invaded by [[Kāti Māmoe]] in the sixteenth century, and then were absorbed by [[Kāi Tahu]] a century later. Ōtautahi was inhabited seasonally, and a major trading centre was established at [[Kaiapoi Pā]]. [[British Empire|British]] colonial settlement began in the mid-nineteenth century. The [[First Four Ships]] were chartered by the [[Canterbury Association]] and brought the Canterbury Pilgrims from Britain to [[Lyttelton Harbour]] in 1850. It became a city by [[royal charter]] on 31 July 1856, making it officially the oldest established city in New Zealand. Christchurch was heavily industrialised in the early 20th century, with and the opening of the [[Main South Line]] railway and the development of state housing saw rapid growth in the city's economy and population.

Christchurch has strong cultural connections with its European elements and architectural identity. Christchurch is also home to a number of performing arts centres and academic institutions (including the [[University of Canterbury]]). Christchurch has hosted numerous international sporting events, notably the [[1974 British Commonwealth Games]] at the purpose-built [[Queen Elizabeth II Park]]. The city has been recognised as an Antarctic gateway since 1901, and is nowadays one of the five [[Antarctic gateway cities]] hosting Antarctic support bases for several nations. Christchurch is served by the [[Christchurch Airport]] in [[Harewood, New Zealand|Harewood]], the country's second-busiest airport.

The city suffered a series of [[2010 Canterbury earthquake|earthquakes from September 2010]], with [[2011 Christchurch earthquake|the most destructive occurring on 22 February 2011]], in which 185 people were killed and thousands of buildings across the city suffered severe damage, with a few central city buildings collapsing, leading to ongoing recovery and rebuilding projects. Christchurch later became the site of [[Christchurch mosque shootings|a terrorist attack]] targeting two mosques on 15 March 2019.

==Toponymy==
The name ''Christchurch'' was adopted at the first meeting of the [[Canterbury Association]] on 27 March 1848. The reason it was chosen is not known with certainty, but the most likely reason is it was named after [[Christ Church, Oxford]], the alma mater of many members of the association, including [[John Robert Godley]].<ref>{{DNZB|last=Hensley|first=Gerald|id=1g12|title=Godley, John Robert|access-date=27 April 2024 }}</ref> Christ Church college had similarities with the planned new city, including its own cathedral, the smallest in England.<ref name=Cowie-1934>{{Citation |last1=Cowie |first1=D.

Many of the early colonists did not like the name, preferring instead the name Lyttelton, but the Colonists' Council resolved to stick with the name of Christchurch in 1851, because it had been used by surveyors and distinguished the settlement from the port.{{sfn|Rice|2008|p=18}}

The [[Māori language|Māori]] name for modern-day Christchurch is {{lang|mi|Ōtautahi}}, meaning {{gloss|the place of Tautahi}}. It was adopted as the Māori name for the city in the 1930s. Ōtautahi precisely refers to a specific site by the [[Avon River / Ōtākaro]] in Central Christchurch.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ōtautahi – Christchurch |url=https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/ti-kouka-whenua/otautahi/ |publisher=Christchurch City Libraries |access-date=15 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101022827/http://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/ti-kouka-whenua/otautahi/ |archive-date=1 November 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=William Anderson |title=Lore and History of the South Island Maori |year=1952 |publisher=Bascands Ltd |location=Christchurch |url=https://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-TayLore-t1-body1-d5.html |access-date=26 April 2024 |page=55 |chapter=Otautahi – Christchurch and its district |archive-date=9 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230809052204/https://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-TayLore-t1-body1-d5.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The site was a seasonal food-gathering place of [[Ngāi Tahu]] chief Te Pōtiki Tautahi.

===Modern history ===

Despite the central city remaining relatively unchanged between 1914 and 1960,{{sfn|Wilson|2005|p=86}} Christchurch grew rapidly during the 20th century in part due to the construction of many [[state housing in New Zealand|state houses]]. The earliest state houses were built in Sydenham in the 1900s, to house workers that were employed in nearby factories, with more houses built in 1909 near the [[Addington Railway Workshops]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/state-housing/ |title=State Housing Christchurch City Libraries |access-date=25 April 2024 |website=Christchurch City Libraries |archive-date=24 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240424115905/https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/state-housing/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Despite being initially thought to be under control, the fire suddenly spread to the upper floors and consumed the entire building within minutes.

==Geography==
[[File:Christchurch, New Zealand, NASA 2.jpg|thumb|right|A satellite image showing Christchurch and surrounding areas]]

=== Location ===
Christchurch is halfway along the east coast of the [[South Island]], facing the South Pacific Ocean. With the exception of the [[Port Hills]] on [[Banks Peninsula]] to its south, the city sits on flat land, on average around {{cvt|20|m}} above sea level.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hobbs |first1=M. |last2=Ahuriri-Driscoll |first2=A. |last3=Kingham |first3=S. |last4=Wiki |first4=J. |last5=Marek |first5=L. |last6=Dionisio |first6=M.R. |last7=Curl |first7=A. |last8=Schluter |first8=P. |last9=Banwell |first9=K. | last10=Mackenbach | first10=J.D. |title=A city profile of Ōtautahi Christchurch |journal=Cities |volume=121 |date=2022 |doi=10.1016/j.cities.2021.103481 |page=103481 }}</ref>

=== Geology ===
{{further|Geology of the Canterbury Region}}

The present land mass of New Zealand split from the super continent of [[Gondwana]] around 85 million years ago. Prior to that time, mudstone and hardened sandstones commonly known as [[greywacke]] was deposited and deformed by [[Tectonics|tectonic]] movement. Following the split from Gondwana, during the period between 80 and 23 million years ago, the land became eroded and subsided below sea level. Marine and terrestrial sediments were deposited, leaving the greywacke as the oldest and deepest layers ([[Basement (geology)|basement rock]]). Around 11–6 million years ago, volcanic eruptions created the [[Banks Peninsula Volcano|Banks Peninsula volcanic complex]]. Over the last two million years as the [[Southern Alps]] were rising, there were multiple periods of [[Glacial period|glaciation]]. Rivers flowing from the mountains carried [[Alluvium|alluvial]] gravels over the area that is now the [[Canterbury Plains]], covering the underlying rock to depths of between 200 and 600 metres. Continuing tectonic movement created faults that penetrate from the greywacke rock into the layers above. These faults remain beneath Canterbury and Christchurch.<ref>{{cite Q|Q125681467 }}</ref>{{Rp|21}}

The glacial/interglacial cycles of the [[Quaternary|Quaternary Period]] led to multiple rises and falls in sea level. These sea level changes occurred over a period when there was also slow subsidence in the eastern coastal plains of Canterbury and Christchurch. The result has been the deposition of sequences of mostly [[Fluvial sediment processes|fluvial]] gravel (occurring during periods of low sea level and glaciation), and fine deposits of silt, sand and clay, with some peat, shells and wood (occurring during interglacial periods when the sea level was similar to the present).<ref name=":0" />{{Rp||page=13}}

=== Aquifer and spring-fed streams ===
The layers of gravel beneath the eastern Canterbury plains and Christchurch area form an [[Aquifer|artesian aquifer]] with the [[Interbedding|interbedded]] fine sediments as an impermeable layer, or aquiclude. Water pressure from the artesian aquifer has led to the formation of numerous spring-fed streams. In Christchurch, the Avon River / Ōtākaro and Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River rivers have spring-fed sources in the western suburbs of Christchurch, and the [[Halswell River]] begins north-west of the Port Hills on the periphery of Christchurch and flows to [[Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora]].<ref name=":0">{{cite Q|Q125680986 }}</ref>{{Rp||page=14}}

As a consequence of the flat terrain and spring-fed streams, large parts of the area now occupied by Christchurch City were originally a coastal wetland, with extensive swamp forests. Much of the forest was destroyed by fire, mostly likely by the earliest inhabitants, from around 1000 [[Common Era|CE]]. When European settlers arrived in the 19th century, the area was a mixture of swamp and tussock grasslands, with only remnant patches of forest. An early European visitor was [[William Barnard Rhodes]], captain of the barque ''Australian,'' who climbed the Port Hills from Lyttelton Harbour in September 1836 and observed a large grassy plain with two small areas of forest. He reported that "All the land that I saw was swamp and mostly covered with water".<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=26 February 2011 |title=Christchurch: a city haunted by its environmental past? |url=https://envirohistorynz.com/2011/02/26/christchurch-a-city-haunted-by-its-environmental-past/ |access-date=25 April 2024 |website=envirohistory NZ |language=en |archive-date=23 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231223053709/https://envirohistorynz.com/2011/02/26/christchurch-a-city-haunted-by-its-environmental-past/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Most of the eastern, southern and northern parts of the city were wet areas when European settlement began.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=White |first1=P.A. |last2=Goodrich |first2=K. |last3=Cave |first3=S. |last4=Minni |first4=G. |date=May 2007 |title=Waterways, Swamps and Vegetation of Christchurch in 1856 and Baseflow Discharge in Christchurch Streams |url=https://docs.niwa.co.nz/library/public/ECtrU07-39.pdf |journal=GNS Science Consultancy Report 2007 |publisher=Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences |issue=103 |access-date=25 April 2024 |archive-date=25 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240425051249/https://docs.niwa.co.nz/library/public/ECtrU07-39.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

There are currently no legal definition of the boundaries of suburbs in Christchurch. The suburb boundaries are largely defined by third-party agencies, such as [[Statistics New Zealand]] and [[NZ Post|New Zealand Post]], and may differ between agencies or sources.<ref>{{Cite web |date=30 March 2018 |title=Suburb boundaries – a Official Information Act request to Christchurch City Council |url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/7543-suburb-boundaries |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420070632/https://fyi.org.nz/request/7543-suburb-boundaries |archive-date=20 April 2018 |access-date=21 April 2024 |website=FYI |language=en }}</ref>

The earliest suburbs of Christchurch were laid out with streets in a grid pattern, centred on [[Cathedral Square, Christchurch|Cathedral Square]]. Growth initially took place along the tramlines, leading to radial development.<ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Wilson |title=The expansion of Christchurch to 1926 |website=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/map/10370/the-expansion-of-christchurch-to-1926 |access-date=21 April 2024 |archive-date=21 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240421064758/https://teara.govt.nz/en/map/10370/the-expansion-of-christchurch-to-1926 |url-status=live }}</ref> Major expansion occurred in the 1950s and 60s, with the development of large areas of [[State housing in New Zealand|state housing]]. Settlements that had originally been remote, such as [[Sumner, New Zealand|Sumner]], [[New Brighton, New Zealand|New Brighton]], [[Upper Riccarton]] and [[Papanui]] eventually became amalgamated into the expanding city.<ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Wilson |title=Canterbury region – Christchurch |website=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/canterbury-region/page-13 |access-date=21 April 2024 |archive-date=9 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109134339/http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/canterbury-region/page-13 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Economic profile in 2023 ===
In 2023, the gross domestic product (GDP) of Christchurch City was $31.5 billion, representing 8.4% of New Zealand's total GDP. The sector with the largest contribution to the Christchurch City GDP was professional, scientific and technical services, at 12%. This is higher than the 9.6% contribution that these services make to the national economy. The next highest contribution to the city GDP was from healthcare and social assistance at 8.8%, versus 6.5% in the national economy. Manufacturing contributed 8.1%, compared with 8.2% in the national economy.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023 |title=Regional Economic Profile – Christchurch City – 2023 Industry structure of economy |url=https://rep.infometrics.co.nz/christchurch-city/economy/structure?compare=new-zealand |access-date=19 April 2024 |website=Infometrics |archive-date=19 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240419073253/https://rep.infometrics.co.nz/christchurch-city/economy/structure?compare=new-zealand |url-status=live }}</ref>

Christchurch City provides a diverse range of services for the Canterbury Region, but there are significant differences in the ranking of the sectors with the greatest contribution to GDP, when comparing the city GDP with the Canterbury Region GDP. Manufacturing and construction are the top two ranked sectors for the Canterbury region, but these two sectors are ranked third and fourth for the contribution to the city GDP. Conversely, professional, scientific and technical services are top ranked for the city, but third in the Canterbury Region GDP. Healthcare and social assistance is ranked second in the city GDP, but only seventh in the Canterbury Region GDP. Agriculture remains a significant contributor to the Canterbury Region GDP (sixth placed at $3.3 billion).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gross Domestic Product of the Canterbury Region, New Zealand – year ended March 2022 |url=https://figure.nz/chart/W9VhJ662mcUp87Ny-jSVnLU9znPF6lmCX |access-date=19 April 2024 |website=Figure.NZ |language=en-nz |archive-date=19 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240419084213/https://figure.nz/chart/W9VhJ662mcUp87Ny-jSVnLU9znPF6lmCX |url-status=live }}</ref>

The four largest industries in the city, based on the percentage of filled jobs were healthcare and social assistance, professional scientific and technical services, construction, and retail trade. Christchurch City had a higher proportion of people in employed in healthcare and social assistance (12.9%) than the national average (10.3%), but the proportions employed in professional, scientific and technical services, construction and retail trade were close to the national averages.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022 |title=Regional Economic Profile – Christchurch City – 2023 Industry structure of employment |url=https://rep.infometrics.co.nz/christchurch-city/employment/structure?compare=new-zealand |access-date=19 April 2024 |website=Infometrics |archive-date=19 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240419080042/https://rep.infometrics.co.nz/christchurch-city/employment/structure?compare=new-zealand |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Industry===
Christchurch is the second-largest manufacturing centre in New Zealand behind [[Auckland]], the sector being the second-largest contributor to the local economy,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Manufacturing Jobs in Christchurch |url=http://www.cdc.org.nz/christchurch/manufacturing-jobs/ |website=CDC |access-date=9 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330130856/http://www.cdc.org.nz/christchurch/manufacturing-jobs/ |archive-date=30 March 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> with firms such as Anderson's making steel work for bridges, tunnels, and [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] dams in the early days of infrastructure work. Now manufacturing is mainly of light products and the key market is Australia, with firms such as those pioneered by the Stewart family among the larger employers. Before clothing manufacture largely moved to Asia, Christchurch was the centre of the New Zealand clothing industry, with firms such as LWR Industries. The firms that remain mostly design and market, and manufacture in Asia. The city also had five footwear manufacturers, but these have been replaced by imports.

In the last few decades, technology-based industries have sprung up in Christchurch.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/opinion/will-tech-companies-stay-committed-christchurch-roll-call |title=Will tech companies stay committed to Christchurch?

There have also been spin-offs from the electrical department of the University of Canterbury engineering school. These included Pulse Data, which became Human Ware (making reading devices and computers for blind people and those with limited vision) and CES Communications (encryption).

Other agribusinesses in Christchurch have included malting, seed development and dressing, wool and meat processing, and small biotechnology operations using by-products from meat works.<ref name="agriculture"/> Dairying has grown strongly in the surrounding areas, with high world prices for milk products and the use of irrigation to lift grass growth on dry land. With its higher labour use, this has helped stop declines in rural population. Many cropping and sheep farms have been converted to dairying. Conversions have been by agribusiness companies as well as by farmers, many of whom have moved south from North Island dairying strongholds such as [[Taranaki]] and the [[Waikato]].

Cropping has always been important in the Canterbury Region. Wheat and barley and various strains of clover and other grasses for seed exporting have been the main crops. These have all created processing businesses in Christchurch. Agriculture in the region has diversified, with a wine industry developing at [[Waipara]], and the beginnings of new horticulture industries such as olive production and processing. Deer farming has led to new processing using antlers for Asian medicine and aphrodisiacs. The high-quality local wine in particular has increased the appeal of Canterbury and Christchurch to tourists.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Guide |title=Christchurch Wineries, Wine Tasting & Vineyards New Zealand |url=http://www.tourism.net.nz/region/christchurch/attractions-and-activities/wineries |website=www.tourism.net.nz |publisher=New Zealand Tourism Guide |access-date=15 August 2017 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816005258/http://www.tourism.net.nz/region/christchurch/attractions-and-activities/wineries |archive-date=16 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

An important component of the regions agricultural calendar is the [[Canterbury A&P Show]]. The first show took place in Christchurch on 22 October 1862<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wigram |first=Henry F. |url=http://archive.org/details/storyofchristchu00wigriala |title=The story of Christchurch, New Zealand |date=1916 |publisher=Christchurch : The Lyttleton Times Co., Ltd. |others=University of California Libraries }}</ref> and is now the largest [[Agricultural show|agricultural and pastoral show]] in New Zealand featuring a combination of agriculture presentations, trade stalls, competitions and entertainment over three days. The Friday of the A&P Show had since at least 1918 been the People's Day or Show Day, and sometime between 1955 and 1958, [[Christchurch City Council]] moved the anniversary day to coincide with Show Day, as this allowed banks and businesses to close and people to attend the A&P Show.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

===Tourism===
[[Tourism in New Zealand|Tourism]] is also a significant factor in the city economy. As a city with a major international airport and the largest city in the South Island, Christchurch is a gateway for international tourists visiting the South Island attractions of [[Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park]], [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]], the [[West Coast Region|West Coast]] and [[Kaikōura]].

There is a [[Aerial lift|cable car]] system called the [[Christchurch Gondola]] which operates as a tourist attraction, providing transport from the [[Heathcote Valley]] to the top of [[Mount Cavendish]] in the city's south-east.

Rail services, both long-distance and commuter, used to focus on the former railway station on Moorhouse avenue. Commuter trains were progressively cancelled in the 1960s and 1970s. The last such service, between Christchurch and [[Rangiora]], ceased in 1976. After the reduction in services, a new [[Christchurch railway station (New Zealand)|Christchurch railway station]] was established at Addington Junction. The [[Main North Line, New Zealand|Main North Line]] railway travels northwards via [[Kaikōura]] to [[Picton, New Zealand|Picton]] and is served by the [[Coastal Pacific]] scheduled passenger train while the [[Main South Line]] heads to [[Invercargill]] via [[Dunedin]] and was used by the [[Southerner (New Zealand train)|Southerner]] until its cancellation in 2002.

The most famous train to depart Christchurch is the [[TranzAlpine]], which travels along the Main South Line to [[Rolleston, New Zealand|Rolleston]] and then turns onto the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland Line]], passes through the [[Southern Alps]] via the [[Otira Tunnel]], and terminates in [[Greymouth]] on the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]]. This trip is often regarded as one of the ten great train journeys in the world for the remarkable scenery through which it passes. The TranzAlpine service is primarily a tourist service and carries no significant commuter traffic.

===Electricity===
The Christchurch City Council established the city's first public electricity supply in 1903, and the city was connected to [[Coleridge Power Station]] in 1914. Until 1989, electricity distribution and retailing in Christchurch was the responsibility of four entities: the Christchurch City Council Municipal Electricity Department (MED), Riccarton Electricity, the Port Hills Energy Authority, and the Central Canterbury Electric Power Board. In 1989, all four companies entered a joint venture, named Southpower. The 1998 electricity sector reforms required all electricity companies to separate their distribution and retailing businesses. Southpower retained its distribution business and sold its retail business to [[Meridian Energy]].
