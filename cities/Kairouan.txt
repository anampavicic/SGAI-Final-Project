==History==
{{More citations needed section|date=December 2023}}

=== Foundation and early Islamic period ===
The foundation of Kairouan dates to about the year 670 when the [[Arab]] general [[Uqba ibn Nafi]] of [[Caliphate|Caliph]] [[Mu'awiya I|Mu'awiya]] selected a site in the middle of a dense forest, then infested with wild beasts and reptiles, as the location of a military post for the conquest of [[Western world|the West]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Formerly, the city of Kamounia was located where Kairouan now stands. It had housed a Byzantine garrison before the Arab conquest, and stood far from the sea – safe from the continued attacks of the [[Berber people|Berbers]] who had fiercely resisted the Arab invasion. Berber resistance continued, led first by [[Kusaila]], whose troops killed Uqba at [[Biskra]] about fifteen years after the establishment of the military post,<ref name="Conant">{{cite book |last=Conant |first=Jonathan |title=Staying Roman: conquest and identity in Africa and the Mediterranean, 439–700 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge New York |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-521-19697-0 |pages=280–281}}</ref> and then by a Berber woman called [[Al-Kahina]] who was killed and her army defeated in 702. Subsequently, there occurred a mass conversion of the [[Berber people|Berbers]] to Islam. [[Kharijites]] or Islamic "outsiders" who formed an egalitarian and puritanical sect appeared and are still present on the island of [[Djerba]].

In October 741, in the course of the [[Berber Revolt|Great Berber Revolt]] in the [[Maghreb]], the [[Ifriqiya]]n army, along with a Syrian force dispatched by the caliph, was destroyed by the Berbers at the [[Battle of Bagdoura]]. The governor [[Kulthum ibn Iyad al-Qasi]] perished in the field, his nephew and successor [[Balj ibn Bishr al-Qushayri]] was holed up with the remnant of the army in [[Spain]], leaving the whole of Ifriqiya open to the advance of the Berber rebels. Not having any more forces at his disposal, the [[Umayyad]] Caliph [[Hisham]] quickly appointed Handhala ibn Safwan as governor of Ifriqiya, with supervisory authority over all the [[Maghreb]] (North Africa west of Egypt) and [[al-Andalus]] (Spain), and instructed him to take whatever forces he could gather to defend Ifriqiya and quash the Berber rebellion. Leaving Egypt in the hand of [[Hafs ibn al-Walid ibn Yusuf al-Hadrami]], Handhala set out westwards in February 742, picking up additional forces from [[Barqa]] (Cyrenaica) and [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]] (Tripolitana). He arrived in Kairouan around April, 742. The [[qadi]] of Ifriqiya, [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Oqba al-Ghaffari]], had been managing the defense of Kairouan, and succeeded in fending off an attack by the Berber rebel army raised in southern Tunisia by the [[Sufri]]te leader [[Oqasha ibn Ayub al-Fezari]]. Handhala ibn Safwan arrived in Kairouan just as Oqasha was said to be mounting a new attack, in coordination with another large Berber army coming in from the west, led by [[Abd al-Wahid ibn Yazid al-Hawwari]]. The Berber rebel armies were to make junction in front of Kairouan, before launching their final attack on the city. Wasting no time, Handhala dispatched a cavalry force to slow down Abd al-Wahid's progress, and threw the bulk of his forces south, defeating Oqasha in a bloody battle at [[El-Qarn]] and taking him prisoner. But Handhala had taken a lot of losses himself, and now faced the unhappy prospect of Abd al-Wahid's gigantic army, said to be some 300,000, ostensibly the largest Berber army ever seen. Hurrying back, Handhala is said to have put the entire population of Kairouan under arms to bolster his ranks, before setting out again. In perhaps the bloodiest encounter in the Berber wars, Handhala ibn Safwan defeated the great Berber army of Abd al-Wahid ibn Yazid at [[Battle of al-Asnam|al-Asnam]] in May 742 (perhaps a little later), just three miles outside of Kairouan. Some 120,000–180,000 Berbers, including Abd al-Wahid, fell in the field of battle in that single encounter.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Egypt as a province in the Islamic caliphate, 641–868 |last=Kennedy |first=Hugh |author-link=Hugh N.

=== Aghlabid period ===
In 745, [[Kharijite]] [[Berber people|Berbers]] captured Kairouan, which was already at that time a developed city with luxuriant gardens and olive groves. Power struggles continued until [[Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab]] recaptured Kairouan at the end of the 8th century.

In 800 [[Caliph]] [[Harun ar-Rashid]] in [[Baghdad]] confirmed Ibrahim as ''[[emir]]'' and hereditary ruler of Ifriqiya. Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab founded the [[Aghlabid]] dynasty which ruled Ifriqiya between 800 and 909. The new emirs embellished Kairouan and made it their capital. It soon became famous for its wealth and prosperity, reaching the levels of [[Basra]] and [[Kufa]] and giving Tunisia a period of power and prosperity.[[File:Aghlabid cistern.jpg|thumb|The Aghlabid Basins|left]]

The Aghlabids built the great mosque and established in it a university that was a centre of education both in Islamic thought and in the secular sciences. Its role can be compared to that of the [[University of Paris]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. In the 9th century, the city became a brilliant focus of Arab and Islamic cultures attracting scholars from all over the [[Islamic World]]. In that period [[Imam]] [[Sahnun]] and [[Asad ibn al-Furat]] made of Kairouan a temple of knowledge and a magnificent centre of diffusion of Islamic sciences. The Aghlabids also built palaces, fortifications and fine waterworks of which only the pools remain. From Kairouan envoys from [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] returned with glowing reports of the Aghlabid palaces, libraries and gardens – and from the crippling taxation imposed to pay for their drunkenness and sundry debaucheries. The Aghlabids also pacified the country and conquered Sicily in 827.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=qamIQbPLMqgC&dq=aghlabids+conquered+sicily+in+827&pg=PA48 Barbara M. Kreutz, ''Before the Normans: Southern Italy in the Ninth and Tenth Centuries'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 1996, p. 48]</ref>

=== Fatimid and Zirid period ===
[[File:Calif al Mahdi Kairouan 912 CE(png).png|thumb|150px|Gold coin of the Fatimid Caliph [[Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah|Al-Mahdi Billah]], minted in Kairouan in 912 CE]]In 893, through the mission of [[Abdullah al Mahdi]], the [[Kutama]] Berbers from the west of the country started the movement of the [[Shiite]] [[Fatimid]]s. The year 909 saw the overthrow of the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Aghlabids who ruled Ifriqiya and the establishment of the Fatimid dynasty. During the rule of the Fatimids, Kairouan was neglected and lost its importance: the new rulers resided first in [[Raqqada]] but soon moved their capital to the newly built [[Al Mahdiyah]] on the eastern coast of Tunisia. After succeeding in extending their rule over all of central [[Maghreb]], an area consisting of the modern countries of [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Libya]], they eventually moved east to [[Egypt]] to found [[Cairo]] making it the capital of their vast Caliphate and leaving the [[Zirids]] as their vassals in Ifriqiya. Governing again from Kairouan, the Zirids led the country through another artistic, commercial and agricultural heyday. Schools and universities flourished, overseas trade in local manufactures and farm produce ran high and the courts of the Zirids rulers were centres of refinement that eclipsed those of their European contemporaries. When the Zirids declared their independence from Cairo and their conversion to Sunni Islam in 1045 by giving allegiance to [[Baghdad]], the Fatimid Caliph [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah]] sent as punishment hordes of troublesome Arab tribes ([[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]]) to invade Ifriqiya. These invaders so utterly captured Kairouan from the Zirids in 1057<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Idris|first=Hady Roger|date=1968 |title=L'invasion hilālienne et ses conséquences|journal=Cahiers de civilisation médiévale|volume=11|issue=43|pages=353–369|doi=10.3406/ccmed.1968.1452|issn=0007-9731}}</ref> and destroyed it that it never regained its former importance and their influx was a major factor in the spread of nomadism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant. Some 1,700 years of intermittent but continual progress was undone within a decade as in most part of the country the land was laid to waste for nearly two centuries.

=== Later history ===
[[File:Street in Kairouan - Tunisia - 1899.jpg|thumb|right|Bab Chouhada Street in 1899]]

In the 13th century under the prosperous [[Hafsids]] dynasty that ruled Ifriqiya, the city started to emerge from its ruins. It is only under the [[Husainid Dynasty]] that Kairouan started to find an honorable place in the country and throughout the Islamic world.

In 1881, Kairouan was taken by the French, after which non-Muslims were allowed access to the city. The French built the {{track gauge|600 mm}} [[Sousse–Kairouan Decauville railway]], which operated from 1882 to 1996, before it was regauged to {{track gauge|1000 mm}} gauge.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

The old city of Kairouan and its associated historic monuments became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |title=Kairouan |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/499/ |access-date=2023-12-18 |website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |language=en}}</ref>

In December 2023, about 30m of wall near the Gate of the Leather Workers collapsed during restoration. Three masons were killed, and several others injured.<ref name="2023-12-17_AFP-ABC">[https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-17/tunisia-wall-collapse-kills-three-unesco-world-heritage-site/103239858 Ancient wall collapsing kills three at Tunisia UNESCO World Heritage Site], [[Agence France-Presse]]/[[ABC News Online]], 2023-12-17</ref>
