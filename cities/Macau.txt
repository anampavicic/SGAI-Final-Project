Formerly a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] colony, the territory of [[Portuguese Macau]] was first leased to [[Portugal]] by the [[Ming dynasty]] as a trading post in 1557. Portugal paid an annual rent and administered the territory under Chinese sovereignty until 1887. Portugal later gained perpetual colonial rights in the [[Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Peking]]. The colony remained under Portuguese rule until the [[Handover of Macau|1999 handover]] to China.

The first known written record of the name "Macau", rendered as "A Ma Gang" ({{lang|zh-hant|亞/阿-媽/馬-港}}), is found in a letter dated 20 November 1555. The local inhabitants believed that the sea goddess [[Mazu (goddess)|Matsu]] (alternatively called A-Ma) had blessed and protected the harbour and referred to the waters around [[A-Ma Temple]] by her name.<ref name="WuJinEtymology">{{harvnb|Wu|Jin|2014}}.</ref> When Portuguese explorers first arrived in the area and asked for the place name, the locals thought they were asking about the temple and told them it was "Ma Kok" ({{lang|zh-hant|媽閣}}).<ref>{{harvnb|Hao|2011|pp=12–13}}.</ref> The earliest Portuguese spelling for this was ''Amaquão''. Multiple variations were used until ''Amacão / Amacao'' and ''Macão / Macao'' became common during the 17th century.<ref name="WuJinEtymology" /> 

The 1911 [[Reforms of Portuguese orthography|reform of Portuguese orthography]] standardised the spelling as ''Macau''; however, the use of ''Macao'' persisted in English and other European languages.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.visitmacao.com.au/macao-tourism-blog/faq/is-it-macau-or-macao/ |title=Is it Macau or Macao? |date=4 September 2019 |publisher=Visit Macao |access-date=16 May 2020 |archive-date=1 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200301045622/https://www.visitmacao.com.au/macao-tourism-blog/faq/is-it-macau-or-macao/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Macau Peninsula]] had many names in Chinese, including ''Jing'ao'' ({{lang|zh-hant|井澳/鏡澳}}), ''Haojing'' ({{lang|zh-hant|濠鏡}}), and ''Haojing'ao'' ({{lang|zh-hant|濠鏡澳}}).<ref name="WuJinEtymology" /><ref name="ChineseEtymology">{{harvnb|Hao|2011|pp=15–16}}.</ref> The islands [[Taipa]], [[Coloane]], and [[Hengqin]] were collectively called ''Shizimen'' ({{lang|zh-hant|十字門}}). These names would later become ''Ou mún'' ({{lang|zh-hant|澳門}}), ''Aomen'' in Mandarin and translating as "bay gate" or "port gate", to refer to the whole territory.<ref name="ChineseEtymology" />

== History ==
{{Main|History of Macau}}

During the [[Qin dynasty]] (221–206 BC), the region was under the jurisdiction of [[Panyu County]], [[Nanhai District|Nanhai Prefecture]] of the province of [[Guangdong]].<ref name="2018YearbookP483">{{harvnb|Macao Yearbook 2018|p=483}}.</ref><ref name="MinahanP169">{{harvnb|Minahan|2014|p=169}}.</ref> The region is first known to have been settled during the [[Han dynasty]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hao|2011|p=15}}.</ref> It was administratively part of [[Dongguan Prefecture]] in the [[Jin dynasty (266–420)|Jin dynasty]] (266–420&nbsp;AD), and alternated under the control of Nanhai and Dongguan in later dynasties. In 1152, during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279 AD), it was under the jurisdiction of the new [[Zhongshan|Xiangshan County]].<ref name="2018YearbookP483" /> In 1277, approximately 50,000 refugees fleeing the [[Mongol conquest of China]] settled in the coastal area.<ref name="MinahanP169" /><ref>{{harvnb|U.S. State Department Notes on Macau|1994|p=2}}</ref>

The first European visitor to reach China by sea was the explorer [[Jorge Álvares]], who arrived in 1513.<ref name="Hao10">{{harvnb|Hao|2011|p=10}}.</ref> Merchants first established a trading post in [[Hong Kong]] waters at [[Tamão]], present-day [[Tuen Mun]], beginning regular trade with nearby settlements in southern China.<ref name="Hao10" /> Military clashes between the Ming and Portuguese navies followed the expulsion of the Tamão traders in 1521.<ref name="HaoTamao">{{harvnb|Hao|2011|pp=11–12}}</ref> Despite the trade ban, Portuguese merchants continued to attempt to settle on other parts of the Pearl River estuary, finally settling on Macau.<ref name="HaoTamao" /> 

In their first attempts at obtaining trading posts by force, the Portuguese were defeated by the Ming Chinese at the [[Battle of Tunmen]] in [[Tamão]] (or [[Tuen Mun]]) in 1521, where the Portuguese lost two ships. They were also defeated at the [[Battle of Sincouwaan]] around [[Lantau Island]], where the Portuguese lost two more ships. Other defeats include [[Shuangyu]] in 1548, where several Portuguese were captured, and near [[Dongshan County]] in 1549, where two Portuguese junks and [[Galeote Pereira]] were captured. During these battles the Ming Chinese captured weapons from the defeated Portuguese which they reverse engineered and mass-produced in China. These included the [[matchlock]] [[musket]] [[arquebus]]es, which they named [[Gun control in China#History|bird guns]], and [[breech-loading swivel guns]], which they named as Folangji ([[Franks#Crusaders and other Western Europeans as "Franks"|Frankish]]) cannon because the Portuguese were known to the Chinese under the name of Franks at this time. 

The Portuguese later returned to China peacefully and presented themselves under the name Portuguese instead of Franks in the [[Luso-Chinese agreement (1554)]].

Macau became a stopover on the [[sea lane]] that connected [[Japan]] with the wider world. The Portuguese could avoid the Pearl River and inched towards [[Quanzhou]] and [[Ningbo]]. But as they failed to establish trading relationships with the Chinese, the Portuguese focused on trade with Japan.<ref>{{cite book | author1= David Abulafia |title=The Boundless Sea: A Human History of the Oceans |publisher= Oxford University Press |year=2019 |page=638 |isbn=9780199934980 }}</ref> The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Macau]] was created in 1576, and by 1583 the [[Municipal Council of Macau]] had been established to handle municipal affairs for the growing settlement.<ref name="Mendes10">{{harvnb|Mendes|2013|p=10}}.</ref>  Macau was at the peak of its prosperity as a major [[warehouse]] during the late 16th century, providing a crucial connection in exporting Chinese silk to Japan during the [[Nanban trade]] period.<ref>{{harvnb|Wills|1998|p=348}}</ref>

Although the Portuguese were initially prohibited from fortifying Macau or stockpiling weapons, the [[Fortaleza do Monte]] was constructed in response to [[Dutch–Portuguese War|frequent Dutch naval incursions]]. The Dutch attempted to take the city in the 1622 [[Battle of Macau]], but were repelled successfully by the Portuguese.<ref>{{harvnb|Garrett|2010|pp=11–13}}</ref> Macau entered a period of decline in the 1640s following a series of catastrophic events for the burgeoning colony: Portuguese access to trade routes was irreparably severed when [[Sakoku|Japan halted trade]] in 1639,<ref>{{harvnb|Lourido|2000|p=211}}</ref> and after the [[Portuguese Restoration War]] of 1640,<ref>{{harvnb|Porter|1993|p=8}}</ref> [[Portuguese Malacca]] fell to the Dutch in 1641.<ref>{{harvnb|Sit|Cremer|Wong|1991|p=10}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hao|2011|p=21}}.</ref>

Maritime trade with China was banned in 1644 following the [[transition from Ming to Qing|Qing conquest]] under the ''[[Haijin]]'' policies. It was limited only to Macau on a lesser scale while the new dynasty focused on eliminating surviving [[Kingdom of Tungning|Ming loyalists]].<ref>{{harvnb|Zhihong|2006|p=8}}.</ref> While the [[Kangxi Emperor]] lifted the prohibition in 1684, China again restricted trade decades later under the [[Canton System]] in 1757.<ref>{{harvnb|Zhihong|2006|pp=8–10}}.</ref> Foreign ships were required to stop first at Macau before further proceeding to [[Guangzhou|Canton]].<ref>{{harvnb|de Sousa|2009|p=77}}.</ref> Qing authorities exercised a much greater role in governing the territory during this period; Chinese residents were subject to Qing courts and new construction had to be approved by the resident [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin]] beginning in the 1740s.<ref>{{harvnb|de Sousa|2009|p=75}}.</ref> As the opium trade became more lucrative during the 18th century, Macau again became an important stopping point en route to China.<ref>{{harvnb|de Sousa|2009|pp=77–78}}.</ref>

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the [[Empire of Japan]] did not occupy the colony and generally respected [[Portugal during World War II|Portuguese neutrality]] in Macau. However, after Japanese troops captured a British cargo ship in Macau waters in 1943, Japan installed a group of government "advisors" as an alternative to military occupation. The territory largely avoided military action during the war except in 1945, when the United States ordered air raids on Macau after learning that the colonial government was preparing to sell aviation fuel to Japan. In 1950 the US paid Portugal more than US$20&nbsp;million in compensation for the damage during the war. <ref>{{harvnb|Garrett|2010|p=116}}.</ref>

Refugees from mainland China swelled the population as they fled from the [[Chinese Civil War]].

Following the handover, Macau liberalised its casino industry (which previously operated under a government-licensed monopoly) to allow foreign investors, starting a new period of economic development. The regional economy grew by a double-digit annual growth rate from 2002 to 2014, making Macau one of the richest economies in the world on a per capita basis.<ref>{{harvnb|Li|2016|p=522}}.</ref> Political debates have centred on the region's jurisdictional independence and the central government's adherence of "[[one country, two systems]]".

{{main|Government of Macau|Politics of Macau|Elections in Macau}}

[[File:Assembleia Legislativa.jpg|thumb|The legislature meets in the [[Macau Legislative Assembly Building|Legislative Assembly Building]] in [[Sé, Macau|Sé]].]]

Macau is a [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative region of China]], with executive, legislative, and judicial powers devolved from the [[Government of China|national government]].<ref name="CastellucciBLFundamentals">{{harvnb|Castellucci|2012|pp=674–675}}.</ref> The [[Joint Declaration on the Question of Macau|Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration]] provided for economic and administrative continuity through the [[Handover of Macau|handover]], resulting in an executive-led governing system largely inherited from the territory's history as a Portuguese colony.<ref>{{harvnb|Chan|2003|pp=506–507}}.</ref> Under these terms and the "[[one country, two systems]]" principle, the [[Macao Basic Law|Basic Law of Macao]] is the regional [[constitution]].<ref>{{harvnb|Krebs|2000|pp=122–124}}.</ref> Because negotiations for the Joint Declaration and Basic Law began after transitional arrangements for Hong Kong were made, Macau's structure of government is very similar to Hong Kong's.<ref>{{harvnb|Castellucci|2012|pp=672–676}}.</ref>

The regional government is composed of three branches:
* ''Executive:'' The [[Chief Executive of Macau|Chief Executive]] is responsible for enforcing regional law,<ref name="BLM50">{{harvnb|Basic Law}} Chapter IV Article 50.</ref> can force reconsideration of legislation,<ref>{{harvnb|Basic Law}} Chapter IV Article 51.</ref> and appoints [[Executive Council of Macau|Executive Council]] members, a portion of the legislature, and principal officials.<ref name="BLM50" /> Acting with the Executive Council, the Chief Executive can propose new bills, issue [[Primary and secondary legislation|subordinate legislation]],<ref>{{harvnb|Basic Law}} Chapter IV Article 58.</ref> and has authority to dissolve the legislature.<ref>{{harvnb|Basic Law}} Chapter IV Article 52.</ref>
* ''Legislature:'' The unicameral [[Legislative Assembly of Macau|Legislative Assembly]] enacts regional law, approves budgets, and has the power to impeach a sitting Chief Executive.<ref>{{harvnb|Basic Law}} Chapter IV Article 71.</ref>
* ''Judiciary:'' The [[Court of Final Appeal (Macau)|Court of Final Appeal]] and [[Judiciary of Macau|lower courts]], whose judges are appointed by the Chief Executive on the advice of a recommendation commission,<ref>{{harvnb|Basic Law}} Chapter IV Article 87.</ref> interpret laws and overturn those inconsistent with the Basic Law.<ref>{{harvnb|Basic Law}} Chapter VIII Article 143.</ref>

The Chief Executive is the head of government, and serves for a maximum of two five-year terms.<ref>{{harvnb|Basic Law}} Chapter IV Article 48.</ref> The [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] (led by the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier of China]]) appoints the Chief Executive after nomination by the Election Committee, which is composed of 400 business, community, and government leaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Chief Executive Election Results|2014}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Basic Law}} Chapter IV Article 47.</ref>

The Legislative Assembly has 33 members, each serving a four-year term: 14 are [[Directly elected member (Macau)|directly elected]], 12 [[Indirectly elected member|indirectly elected]], and 7 [[Appointed Member of the Legislative Assembly|appointed]] by the Chief Executive.<ref>{{harvnb|Chan|2003|p=506}}.</ref> Indirectly elected assemblymen are selected from limited electorates representing sectors of the economy or special interest groups.<ref>{{harvnb|Yu|Chin|2012|pp=97–98}}.</ref> All directly elected members are chosen with [[proportional representation]].<ref>{{harvnb|Yu|Chin|2012|p=103}}.</ref>

Twelve political parties had representatives elected to the Legislative Assembly in the [[2017 Macanese legislative election|2017 election]].<ref>{{harvnb|Legislative Assembly Election Results|2017}}.</ref> These parties have aligned themselves into two ideological groups: the [[Pro-Beijing camp (Macau)|pro-establishment]] (the current government) and [[Pro-democracy camp (Macau)|pro-democracy]] camps.<ref>{{harvnb|Li|2016|pp=527–528}}.</ref> Macau is represented in the [[National People's Congress]] by 12 deputies chosen through an electoral college, and 29 delegates in the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] appointed by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|central government]].<ref name="nationalReps" />

[[File:Macau Government Headquarters 01.JPG|thumb|The [[Macau Government Headquarters]] is the official office of the [[Chief Executive of Macau|Chief Executive]].]]
[[Law of the People's Republic of China|Chinese national law]] does not generally apply in the region, and Macau is treated as a separate jurisdiction.<ref name="CastellucciBLFundamentals" /> Its judicial system is based on [[Law of Portugal|Portuguese civil law]], continuing the legal tradition established during colonial rule. Interpretative and amending power over the Basic Law and jurisdiction over acts of state lie with the central authority, however, making regional courts ultimately subordinate to the mainland's [[socialist law|socialist]] [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system.

The territory's jurisdictional independence is most apparent in its [[Visa policy of Macau|immigration]] and taxation policies. The Identification Department issues [[Macao Special Administrative Region passport|passports]] for permanent residents which differ from those issued by the mainland or Hong Kong, and the region maintains a regulated border with the rest of the country.<ref>{{harvnb|Law No. 8/1999, Law about Permanent Resident and Right of Abode in the Macao Special Administrative Region}}.</ref> All travellers between Macau and China and Hong Kong must pass border controls, regardless of nationality.<ref>

The [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] and the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] handle diplomatic matters, but Macau retains the ability to maintain separate economic and cultural [[Foreign relations of Macau|relations with foreign nations]].<ref>{{harvnb|Basic Law}} Chapter II Article 12.</ref> The territory negotiates its own trade agreements and actively participates in supranational organisations, including agencies of the [[World Trade Organization]] and [[United Nations]].<ref>

===Lusophonia membership===
Macau is not a member of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]], despite Portuguese being one of its official languages. This is due to it not being a sovereign nation, but a subnational division of China. In 2006, during the II Ministerial meeting between China and Portuguese Speaking Countries, the CPLP Executive Secretary and Deputy ambassador Tadeu Soares invited the Chief Executive of the Government of the Macau Special Administrative Region, Edmund Ho, to request the Associate Observer status for Macau. The Government of Macau has yet to make this request. In 2016, Murade Murargy, then executive secretary of CPLP said in an interview that Macau's membership is a complicated question, since like the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia region]] in [[Spain]], it is not an independent country, but only a part of China.<ref name="PontoFinal_2016-10-29">{{Cite web |last=Murargy |first=Murade |date=29 October 2016 |title=Adesáo de Macau á CPLP é questáo complicada, diz Murargy |url=https://pontofinalmacau.wordpress.com/2016/10/29/adesao-de-macau-a-cplp-e-questao-complicada-diz-murargy/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803185347/https://pontofinalmacau.wordpress.com/2016/10/29/adesao-de-macau-a-cplp-e-questao-complicada-diz-murargy/ |archive-date=3 August 2020 |access-date=2 June 2020 |website=pontofinalmacau.wordpress.com |quote=Mais difícil será, na perspectiva de Murade Murargy, urna eventual adesáo á CPLP de territorios, como a Regiáo Administrativa Especial de Macau ou a Galiza, ou, por outro lado, de comunidades luso-descendentes espalhadas pela Asia: "Isso nao, porque os territorios estáo dentro de países", afirmou Murargy, que lembrou no entanto que a China tem utilizado a Regiáo Administrativa Especial de Macau como urna plataforma para a cooperacáo com os países lusófonos, através do Fórum Macau}}</ref> However, the ''Instituto Internacional de Macau'' ({{lang|zh-Hant-MO|澳門國際研究所}})<!--Chinese from https://www.iimacau.org.mo/--> and the [[University of Saint Joseph|University of São José]] are Consultative Observers of the CPLP.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Comunidade dos Países de Língua Portuguesa |date=5 September 2011 |title=Notícia - Seminário Festlatino de Macau |url=https://www.cplp.org/id-4447.aspx?Action=1&NewsId=1732&currentPage=73&M=NewsV2&PID=10872 |access-date=5 November 2021 |website=www.cplp.org |archive-date=26 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220526110006/https://www.cplp.org/id-4447.aspx?Action=1&NewsId=1732&currentPage=73&M=NewsV2&PID=10872 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Rocheleau |first=Jake |title=CPLP Consultative Observer - USJ |url=https://www.usj.edu.mo/en/international/observer-networks/ |access-date=5 November 2021 |website=USJ Macao |language=en |archive-date=5 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211105135157/https://www.usj.edu.mo/en/international/observer-networks/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Administrative Division of Macau.png|thumb|Administrative divisions of Macau]]
The territory is divided into seven parishes.

Macau is located on China's southern coast, {{cvt|60|km|mi}} west of [[Hong Kong]], on the western side of the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] estuary. It is surrounded by the [[South China Sea]] in the east and south, and neighbours the Guangdong city of [[Zhuhai]] to the west and north.<ref name="MokHoi202">{{harvnb|Mok|Hoi|2005|p=202}}.</ref> The territory consists of [[Macau Peninsula]], [[Taipa]], and [[Coloane]].<ref>{{harvnb|Huang|Ho|Du|2011|p=354}}.</ref> A {{cvt|1|km2|sqmi}} parcel of land in neighbouring [[Hengqin]] island that hosts the [[University of Macau]] also falls under the regional government's jurisdiction.<ref name="ShengGuP76" /> The territory's highest point is [[Coloane Alto]], {{cvt|170.6|m|ft}} above sea level.<ref name="parishes" />

Urban development is concentrated on peninsular Macau, where most of the population lives.<ref>{{harvnb|Population By-Census|2016|p=10}}.</ref> The peninsula was originally a separate island with hilly terrain, which gradually became a [[tombolo]] as a connecting sandbar formed over time.

[[Cotai]], the area of reclaimed land connecting Taipa and Coloane, contains many of the newer casinos and resorts established after 1999.<ref name="ShengGuP7778" /> The region's jurisdiction over the surrounding sea was greatly expanded in 2015, when it was granted an additional {{cvt|85|km2|sqmi}} of maritime territory by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mok|Ng|2015}}.</ref> Further reclamation is underway to develop parts of the [[Macau New Urban Zone]].<ref>{{harvnb|Beitler|2019}}.</ref> The territory also has control over part of an artificial island to maintain a [[border checkpoint]] for the [[Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge]].<ref name="parishes" /><ref>

=== Climate ===
Despite being located south of the [[Tropic of Cancer]], Macau has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cwa''), characteristic of southern China. The territory is dual season dominant – summer (May to September) and winter (December to February) are the longest seasons, while spring (March and April) and autumn (October and November) are relatively brief periods.<ref name="MokHoi202" /> The [[East Asian Monsoon|summer monsoon]] brings warm and humid air from the sea, with the most frequent rainfall occurring during the season. [[Typhoon]]s also occur most often then, bringing significant spikes in rainfall. During the winter, northern winds from the continent bring dry air and much less rainfall.<ref>{{harvnb|Mok|Hoi|2005|p=220}}.</ref> The highest and lowest temperatures recorded at the [[Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau]] are {{cvt|38.9|°C|°F|1}} on both 2 July 1930 and 6 July 1930 and {{cvt|-1.8|°C|°F|1}} on 26 January 1948.<ref name = macaoclimate/>

Macau has a [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[service economy]] largely based on [[casino]] gaming and tourism. It is the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|83rd-largest economy]], with a [[Gross domestic product#Nominal GDP and adjustments to GDP|nominal GDP]] of approximately MOP433&nbsp;billion (US$53.9&nbsp;billion).<ref name="IMFWEO.MO" /> The GDP per capita was US$69,430 in 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-02-26 |title=Macau 2024 GDP set to grow by 10 pct: Economy tsar |url=https://www.macaubusiness.com/macau-2024-gdp-set-to-grow-by-10-pct-economy-tsar/ |access-date=2024-09-09 |website=Macau Business |language=en-GB |archive-date=13 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240913231358/https://www.macaubusiness.com/macau-2024-gdp-set-to-grow-by-10-pct-economy-tsar/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Although Macau has one of the highest per capita GDPs, the territory also has a high level of [[Economic inequality|wealth disparity]].<ref name="ShengGuP7778" /> Macau's gambling industry is the largest in the world, generating over MOP195&nbsp;billion (US$24&nbsp;billion) in revenue and about seven times larger than that of [[Las Vegas]].<ref name="ShengGuP72" /> Macau's gambling revenue was $37&nbsp;billion in 2018.<ref name=wsj>{{cite news |title=Casino Boom in Asia Pressures Vegas Operators: Region's new revenues aim to draw gamblers beyond Macau, U.S. giants' longtime hub |author=Ese Erheriene |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=7 May 2019 |page=B5}}</ref> Taxes from gambling revenues fund a robust welfare system and an annual cash payment to Macau's citizens.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=204}}

Economic uncertainty may account for some of the drop, but alternate Asian gambling venues do as well. For example, Chinese visitors to the Philippines more than doubled between 2015 and 2018, since the City of Dreams casino opened in Manila.<ref name=wsj/>

Casino gambling was legalised in 1962 and the gaming industry initially operated under a government-licensed monopoly granted to the [[Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macau]]. This licence was renegotiated and renewed several times before ending in 2002 after 40 years.<ref>{{harvnb|Godinho|2014|p=4}}.</ref> The government then allowed open bidding for casino licences to attract foreign investors.<ref name="ShengGuP74">{{harvnb|Sheng|Gu|2018|p=74}}.</ref> Along with an easing of travel restrictions on mainland Chinese visitors, this triggered a period of rapid economic growth; from 1999 to 2016, Macau's [[gross domestic product]] multiplied by 7<ref name="ShengGuP72" /> and the unemployment rate dropped from 6.3 to 1.9 per cent.<ref name="ShengGuP76" /> The [[Sands Macao]], [[Wynn Macau]], [[MGM Macau]], and [[Venetian Macau]] were all opened during the first decade after liberalisation of casino concessions.<ref name="ShengGuP74" /> Casinos employ about 24 per cent of the total workforce in the region.<ref name="ShengGuP76" /> "Increased competition from casinos popping up across Asia to lure away Chinese high rollers and tourists" in Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Nepal, the Philippines, Australia, Vietnam and the Russian Far East led in 2019 to the lowest revenues in three years.<ref name= wsj/>

Export-oriented manufacturing previously contributed to a much larger share of economic output, peaking at 36.9 per cent of GDP in 1985<ref>{{harvnb|Sit|1991|p=68}}.</ref> and falling to less than 1 per cent in 2017.<ref>{{harvnb|Macao Industrial Structure|2017}}.</ref> The bulk of these exports were cotton textiles and apparel, but also included toys and electronics.<ref>{{harvnb|Sit|1991|pp=70–71}}.</ref> At the handover in 1999, manufacturing, financial services, construction and real estate, and gaming were the four largest sectors of the economy.<ref name="ShengGuP72" /> Macau's shift to an economic model entirely dependent on gaming caused concern over its overexposure to a single sector, prompting the regional government to attempt re-diversifying its economy.<ref>{{harvnb|Sheng|Gu|2018|pp=78–80}}.</ref>

The [[Fire Services Bureau]] is responsible for ambulance service (Ambulância de Macau). The [[Macau Red Cross]] also operates ambulances ([[Toyota HiAce]] vans) for emergency and non-emergencies to local hospitals with volunteer staff.

{{As of|2016}} Macau healthcare authorities send patients to [[Queen Mary Hospital (Hong Kong)|Queen Mary Hospital]] in Hong Kong in instances where the local Macau hospitals are not equipped to deal with their scenarios, and many Macau residents intentionally seek healthcare in Hong Kong because they place more trust in Hong Kong doctors than in Mainland-trained doctors operating in Macau.<ref name=Yaupatients/>

== Education ==
{{Main|Education in Macau}}

[[File:UM Hengqin 2.jpg|thumb|The main campus of the [[University of Macau]] is located in neighbouring [[Hengqin]].]]

Education in Macau does not have a single centralised set of standards or curriculum. Individual schools follow different educational models, including Chinese, Portuguese, Hong Kong, and British systems.<ref name="TangBrayEdu">{{harvnb|Tang|Bray|2000|pp=473–474}}.</ref> Children are required to attend school from the age of five until completion of lower secondary school, or at age 15. Of residents aged 3 and older, 69 per cent completed lower secondary education, 49 per cent graduated from an upper secondary school, 21 per cent earned a bachelor's degree or higher.<ref>{{harvnb|Population By-Census|2016|p=8}}.</ref> Mandatory education has contributed to an adult literacy rate of 96.5 per cent. While lower than that of other developed economies, the rate is due to the influx of refugees from mainland China during the post-war colonial era. Much of the elderly population were not formally educated due to war and poverty.<ref>{{harvnb|Population By-Census|2016|p=9}}.</ref>

Most schools in the territory are private institutions. Out of the 77 non-tertiary schools, 10 are public and the other 67 are privately run.<ref name="2018YearbookP289">{{harvnb|Macao Yearbook 2018|p=289}}.</ref> The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Macau]] maintains an important position in territorial education, managing 27 primary and secondary schools.<ref>

</ref> The government provides 15 years of free education for all residents enrolled in publicly run schools,<ref name="2018YearbookP289" /> and subsidises tuition for students in private schools. Students at the secondary school level studying in neighbouring areas of Guangdong are also eligible for tuition subsidies.<ref>{{harvnb|Macao Yearbook 2018|p=291}}.</ref>

The vast majority of schools use Cantonese as the [[medium of instruction]], with written education in Chinese and compulsory classes in Mandarin. A minority of private schools use English or Portuguese as the primary teaching language. Portuguese-Chinese schools mainly use Chinese, but additionally require mandatory Portuguese-language classes as part of their curriculum.<ref name="TangBrayEdu" />

Macau has [[List of universities and colleges in Macau|ten universities and tertiary education institutes]]. The [[University of Macau]], founded in 1981, is the territory's only public comprehensive university. The [[Kiang Wu Hospital#Kiang Wu Nursing College of Macau|Kiang Wu Nursing College of Macau]] is the oldest higher institute, specialising in educating future nursing staff for the college's parent hospital. The [[University of Saint Joseph]], [[Macau University of Science and Technology]], and the [[City University of Macau]] were all established in subsequent years. Five other institutes specialise in specific vocations or provide [[continuing education]].<ref>{{harvnb|Macao Yearbook 2018|pp=298, 304–307}}.</ref>

The mixing of [[Culture of China|Chinese]] and [[Portuguese culture]] and religious traditions for more than four centuries has left Macau with an inimitable collection of holidays, festivals and events. The biggest event of the year is the [[Macau Grand Prix]] each November,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.macau.grandprix.gov.mo/en/ |title=Macau Grand Prix |access-date=1 July 2019 |publisher=Macau Grand Prix Committee |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701173824/https://www.macau.grandprix.gov.mo/en/ |archive-date=1 July 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> when the main streets of the Macau Peninsula are converted to a racetrack bearing similarities with the [[Monaco Grand Prix]]. Other annual events include Macau Arts festival in March, the International Fireworks Display Contest in September, the International Music festival in October and/or November, and the Macau International Marathon in December.

The Lunar [[Chinese New Year]] is the most important traditional festival, and celebration normally takes place in late January or early February.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/macau/macau-festivals-&-events/index.html |title=Macau Festivals & Events |publisher=AsiaRooms.com |date=17 February 2008 |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218044033/http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/macau/macau-festivals-%26-events/index.html |archive-date=18 February 2008}}</ref> The Pou Tai Un Temple in Taipa is the place for the Feast of Tou Tei, the Earth god, in February.

The A-Ma Temple, which honours the Goddess Matsu, is in full swing in April with many worshipers celebrating the A-Ma festival. In May, it is common to see dancing dragons at the Feast of the Drunken Dragon and twinkling-clean Buddhas at the Feast of the Bathing of Lord Buddha. In [[Coloane Village]], the [[Taoist]] god [[Tam Kong]] is also honoured on the same day.<ref name=Asiarooms/> [[Dragon Boat Festival]] is brought into play on Nam Van Lake in June and Hungry Ghosts' festival, in late August and/or early September every year. All events and festivities of the year end with [[Dongzhi Festival|Winter Solstice]] in December.

Macau preserves many historical properties in the urban area. Its [[Historic Centre of Macau|historic centre]], which includes some twenty-five historic locations, was officially listed as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] on 15 July 2005 during the 29th session of the [[World Heritage Committee]], held in [[Durban]], South Africa.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/135 |date=July 15, 2005 |title=Mostar, Macao and Biblical vestiges in Israel are among the 17 cultural sites inscribed on UNESCO's World Heritage List |access-date=5 September 2006 |publisher=UNESCO |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813122915/https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/135 |archive-date=13 August 2006}}</ref>

Food in Macau is mainly based on both [[Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese]] and [[Portuguese cuisine]], drawing influences from [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] and [[Malay cuisine|Malay]] dishes as well, reflecting a unique cultural and culinary blend after centuries of colonial rule.<ref>{{harvnb|Long|2015|p=389}}.</ref> Portuguese recipes were adapted to use local ingredients, such as fresh seafood, [[turmeric]], [[coconut milk]], and [[adzuki bean]]s. These adaptations produced Macanese variations of traditional Portuguese dishes including ''[[caldo verde]]'', [[minchee]], and ''[[cozido à portuguesa]]''. While many restaurants claim to serve traditional Portuguese or Macanese dishes, most serve a mix of Cantonese-Portuguese fusion cuisine. ''[[Galinha à portuguesa]]'' is an example of a Chinese dish that draws from Macanese influences, but is not part of Macanese cuisine.<ref name="LongMacauFood">{{harvnb|Long|2015|p=390}}.</ref> ''[[Cha chaan teng]]'', a type of fast casual diner originating in Hong Kong that serves that region's interpretation of Western food, are also prevalent in Macau.<ref>{{harvnb|Long|2015|p=391}}.</ref> ''[[Pastel de nata]]'', [[pork chop bun]]s, and [[almond biscuit]]s are popular street food items.<ref name="LongMacauFood" />

=== Sports ===
{{main|Sport in Macau}}
[[File:2008 Macau F3 GP.JPG|thumb|[[Formula Three]] racers in the 2008 [[Macau Grand Prix]]]]

Despite its small area, Macau is home to a variety of sports and recreational facilities that have hosted a number of major international sporting events, including the [[2005 East Asian Games]], the [[2006 Lusophony Games]], and the [[2007 Asian Indoor Games]].

The territory regularly hosts the [[Macau Grand Prix]], one of the most significant annual motorsport competitions that uses city streets as the racetrack. It is the only [[street circuit]] that hosts [[Formula Three]], [[Touring car racing|touring car]], and motorcycle races in the same event. The [[Guia Circuit]], with narrow corner clearance and a winding path, is considered an extremely challenging course and a serious milestone for prospective [[Formula One]] racers.<ref>{{cite web |last=Shadbolt |first=Peter |date=7 November 2013 |title=Macau Grand Prix: The final exam for racers |url=http://travel.cnn.com/macau-grand-prix-737446/ |publisher=[[CNN]] |access-date=27 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131107172825/http://travel.cnn.com/macau-grand-prix-737446/ |archive-date=7 November 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Macau represents itself separately from mainland China with its own sports teams in international competitions. The territory maintains its own [[Sports and Olympic Committee of Macau, China|National Olympic Committee]], but does not compete in the [[Olympic Games]]. [[International Olympic Committee]] rules specify that new NOCs can only be admitted if they represent sovereign states (Hong Kong has participated in the Olympics since before the regulation change in 1996).<ref>{{harvnb|Mallon|Heijmans|2011|p=211}}.</ref>
