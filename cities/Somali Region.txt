[[Jijiga]] is the capital of the Somali Region. The capital was formerly [[Gode]], until Jijiga became the capital in 1995 on account of political considerations.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Monthly Situation Report - April 1994|url=https://www.africa.upenn.edu/eue_web/strp0494.htm|access-date=2022-02-19|website=www.africa.upenn.edu}}</ref>

The Somali regional government is composed of the executive branch, led by the President; the legislative branch, which comprises the State Council; and the judicial branch, which is led by the State Supreme Court.

== Overview ==
What is now the Somali Region was part of the [[Menelik II's conquests|conquests]] of [[Menelik II]] in the late 19th century. 

The Somali Region formed a large part of the pre-1995 provinces of [[Hararghe]], [[Bale Province, Ethiopia|Bale]] and [[Sidamo  province|Sidamo]]. The population is predominantly [[Somali (ethnicity)|Somali]], and there have been attempts to incorporate the area into a [[Greater Somalia]]. In the 1977, Somalia invaded Ethiopia, igniting the [[Ogaden War]], which Somalia lost due to timely military intervention from the [[Soviet Union]] and its ally [[Cuba]]. Despite this defeat, local groups still tried either to become part of Somalia or independent.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}<ref>{{Cite journal |title=CIA, Talking Points on Soviet/Cuban Involvement in Ethiopia, March 17, 1978, Secret. |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/ejb9789004244627.b09073 |access-date=2023-06-21 |website=Cold War Intelligence|doi=10.1163/ejb9789004244627.b09073 }}</ref>

The 2007 [[Abole oil field raid]], in which 72 Chinese and Ethiopian oilfield workers were killed, has led to a [[2007–2008 Ethiopian crackdown in Ogaden|series of military reprisals]] against the rebel group ONLF [[Ogaden National Liberation Front]].{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

Until its first-ever district elections in February 2004, Zonal and [[woreda]] administrators and village chairmen were appointed by the Regional government. Senior politicians at the Regional level nominated their clients to the local government positions. In the 2004 local elections, each woreda elected a council including a spokesman, vice-spokesman, administrator, and vice-administrator. These councils have the responsibility of managing budgets and development activities within their respective districts.<ref>Tobias Hagmann, Mohamud H.

=== Judicial branch ===
There are three levels of the Somali region [[judiciary]]. The lowest level is the court of common pleas: each woreda maintains its own constitutionally mandated court of common pleas, which maintain jurisdiction over all justiciable matters. The intermediate-level court system is the district court system. Four courts of appeals exist, each retaining jurisdiction over appeals from common pleas, municipal, and county courts in an administrative zone. A case heard in this system is decided by a three-judge panel, and each judge is elected.

The highest-ranking court, the Somali Supreme Court, is Somali's "court of last resort". A Seven-justice panel composes the court, which, by its own discretion, hears appeals from the courts of appeals, and retains original jurisdiction over limited matters. The chief judge is called the Chief of Soamli Supreme Court Abdullahi Saed Omar. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jfapfe.org/News1.html|title=MOU Signing ceremony With Federal and Regional Supreme Courts of Ethiopia to Facilitate Support for Clearance of Backlog Files|date=14 August 2015|website=Justice For All-PF Ethiopia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105024748/http://www.jfapfe.org/News1.html|archive-date=5 November 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=8 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
