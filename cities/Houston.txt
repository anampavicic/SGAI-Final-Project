=== Early settlement to the 20th century ===
The Allen brothers—[[Augustus Chapman Allen|Augustus Chapman]] and [[John Kirby Allen|John Kirby]]—explored town sites on Buffalo Bayou and [[Galveston Bay]]. According to historian David McComb, "[T]he brothers, on August 26, 1836, bought from Elizabeth E. Parrott, wife of T.F.L. Parrott and widow of John Austin, the south half of the lower league [{{convert|2214|acre|ha|adj=on}} tract] granted to her by her late husband. They paid $5,000 total, but only $1,000 of this in cash; notes made up the remainder." This was financed by assets inherited by Augustus's wife, [[Charlotte Baldwin Allen]]. <ref>{{cite book |title=Houston: A History |first=David G. |last=McComb |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |year=1981 |edition=2nd |page=11}}</ref>

The Allen brothers ran their first advertisement for Houston just four days later in the ''Telegraph and Texas Register'', naming the notional town in honor of Sam Houston, who would become [[President of the Republic of Texas|President]] later that year.<ref name="HouHTO" /> They successfully lobbied the [[Congress of the Republic of Texas|Republic of Texas Congress]] to designate Houston as the temporary capital, agreeing to provide the new government with a state capitol building.<ref name="tsha_AC">{{cite web |title=Allen, Augustus Chapman |first=Amelia W. |last=Williams |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |series=Handbook of Texas Online |access-date=April 12, 2018 |date=August 24, 2016 |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fal17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412212254/https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fal17 |archive-date=April 12, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> About a dozen persons resided in the town at the beginning of 1837, but that number grew to about 1,500 by the time the Texas Congress convened in Houston for the first time that May.<ref name="HouHTO" /> The Republic of Texas granted Houston incorporation on June 5, 1837, as [[James Sanders Holman|James S.

In 1839, the Republic of Texas relocated its capital to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. The town suffered another setback that year when a yellow fever epidemic claimed about one life for every eight residents, yet it persisted as a commercial center, forming a symbiosis with its Gulf Coast port, Galveston. Landlocked farmers brought their produce to Houston, using Buffalo Bayou to gain access to Galveston and the Gulf of Mexico. Houston merchants profited from selling staples to farmers and shipping the farmers' produce to Galveston.<ref name=HouHTO/>

The great majority of enslaved people in Texas came with their owners from the older slave states. Sizable numbers, however, came through the domestic slave trade. [[New Orleans]] was the center of this trade in the Deep South, but slave dealers were in Houston. Thousands of [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] black people lived near the city before the [[American Civil War]]. Many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations,<ref>{{Cite web|date=December 21, 2016|title=Blood and Sugar|url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/sugar-land-slave-convict-labor-history/|access-date=July 29, 2020|website=Texas Monthly|language=en}}</ref> while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Texas History|url=http://www.brookelandisd.net/page/open/3151/0/Chapter%2017%20Section%204%20Reading.pdf}}</ref>

In 1840, the community established a chamber of commerce, in part to promote shipping and navigation at the newly created port on Buffalo Bayou.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.houstontx.gov/savvy/archives/sum06/sum06_heritage.htm |first=John |last=Perry |title=Born on the Bayou: city's murky start|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218055155/http://www.houstontx.gov/savvy/archives/sum06/sum06_heritage.htm |archive-date=December 18, 2011 |work=City Savvy |edition=Online |date=Summer 2006 |publisher=City of Houston}}</ref>

By 1860, Houston had emerged as a commercial and [[Railroad|railroad hub]] for the export of cotton.<ref name="SHQa4" /> Railroad spurs from the Texas inland converged in Houston, where they met rail lines to the ports of Galveston and [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]].

Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of [[halite]], a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into [[salt dome]] formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. The thick, rich, sometimes black, surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow.<ref>[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hch07 Harris County] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203083934/https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hch07 |date=December 3, 2017 }}.

Though Houston is the largest city in the United States without formal [[zoning]] regulations, it has developed similarly to other [[Sun Belt]] cities because the city's land use regulations and [[Covenant (law)#In a legal context|legal covenants]] have played a similar role.<ref name="nytzoning">{{cite news |title=FOCUS: Houston; A Fresh Approach To Zoning |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=March 27, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/17/realestate/focus-houston-a-fresh-approach-to-zoning.html |first=Robert |last=Reinhold |date=August 17, 1986 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402043755/http://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/17/realestate/focus-houston-a-fresh-approach-to-zoning.html |archive-date=April 2, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="nozoning">{{cite web |title=Zoning Without Zoning |work=planetizen.com |access-date=March 27, 2009 |url=http://www.planetizen.com/node/109 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016050640/http://www.planetizen.com/node/109 |archive-date=October 16, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> Regulations include mandatory lot size for single-family houses and requirements that parking be available to tenants and customers.

[[File:Hurricane-Tropical Storm Harvey in Houston - August 27 2017 AM (36032737983).jpg|thumb|Flooded parking lot during Hurricane Harvey, August 2017]]
Because of Houston's [[wet season]] and proximity to the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]], the city is prone to flooding from heavy rains; the most notable flooding events include [[Tropical Storm Allison]] in 2001 and [[Hurricane Harvey]] in 2017, along with most recent [[Tropical Storm Imelda]] in 2019 and [[Tropical Storm Beta (2020)|Tropical Storm Beta]] in 2020. In response to Hurricane Harvey, Mayor Sylvester Turner of Houston initiated plans to require developers to build homes that will be less susceptible to flooding by raising them two feet above the [[100-year flood|500-year floodplain]]. Hurricane Harvey damaged hundreds of thousands of homes and dumped trillions of gallons of water into the city.<ref name="regulations">{{Cite web|last1=Cardenas|first1=Cat|last2=Formby|first2=Brandon|work=The Texas Tribune|date=April 4, 2018 |url=https://www.texastribune.org/2018/04/04/houston-city-council-approves-changes-floodplain-regulations-narrow-vo/ |title=Houston council approves changes to floodplain regulations in effort to reduce flood damage |access-date=January 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190609023026/https://www.texastribune.org/2018/04/04/houston-city-council-approves-changes-floodplain-regulations-narrow-vo/ |archive-date=June 9, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> In places this led to feet of standing water that blocked streets and flooded homes.

Their plan would bring in $360 million in revenue and boost city population and tax revenue. In order to meet the new floodplain regulations, the developers needed to elevate the lowest floors two feet above the 500-year floodplain, equivalent to five or six feet above the 100-year base flood elevation, and build a channel to direct stormwater runoff toward detention basins. Before Hurricane Harvey, the city had bought $10.7 million in houses in this area specifically to take them out of danger. In addition to developing new streets and single-family housing within a floodplain, a flowing flood-water stream termed a floodway runs through the development area, a most dangerous place to encounter during any future flooding event.<ref name="billion">{{Cite news |url=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/What-s-in-a-floodway-In-Houston-20-000-12409821.php |title=What's in Houston's worst flood zones?

Before the 1970s, the city's [[gay bar]]s were spread around Downtown Houston and what is now [[midtown Houston]]. LGBT Houstonians needed to have a place to socialize after the closing of the gay bars. They began going to Art Wren, a 24-hour restaurant in Montrose.

In 2013, Houston was identified as the number one U.S. city for job creation by the U.S. Bureau of Statistics after it was not only the first major city to regain all the jobs lost in the preceding economic downturn, but also after the crash, more than two jobs were added for every one lost. Economist and vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership Patrick Jankowski attributed Houston's success to the ability of the region's real estate and energy industries to learn from historical mistakes. Furthermore, Jankowski stated that "more than 100 foreign-owned companies relocated, expanded or started new businesses in Houston" between 2008 and 2010, and this openness to external business boosted job creation during a period when domestic demand was problematically low.<ref name="One">{{cite web |title=Houston Is Unstoppable: Why Texas' Juggernaut Is America's #1 Job Creator |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/05/houston-is-unstoppable-why-texas-juggernaut-is-americas-1-job-creator/275927/ |work=The Atlantic |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group |access-date=May 29, 2013 |last=Thompson |first=Derek |date=May 28, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531125233/http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/05/houston-is-unstoppable-why-texas-juggernaut-is-americas-1-job-creator/275927/ |archive-date=May 31, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land metropolitan area is served by one public television station and two public radio stations. [[KUHT]] channel 8 (''Houston Public Media'') is a [[PBS]] member station and is the first public television station in the United States. Houston Public Radio is listener-funded and comprises one [[NPR]] member station, [[KUHF]] (''News 88.7''). The University of Houston System owns and holds broadcasting licenses to KUHT and KUHF. The stations broadcast from the Melcher Center for Public Broadcasting on the campus of the University of Houston. Houston additionally is served by the [[Pacifica Foundation]] public radio station [[KPFT]]. Commercial radio stations include [[KKBQ]] (92.9 FM), [[KILT (AM)|KILT]] (610 AM), [[KILT-FM]] (100.3 FM), [[KKHH]] (95.7 FM), [[KTRH]] (740 AM), [[KROI]] (92.1 FM), [[KODA]] (99.1 FM), [[KMJQ]] (102.1 FM), and [[KBXX]] (97.9 FM).

Houston and its metropolitan area are served by the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', its only major daily newspaper with wide distribution. [[Hearst Communications]], which owns and operates the ''Houston Chronicle'', bought the assets of the ''[[Houston Post]]''—its long-time rival and main competition—when ''Houston Post'' ceased operations in 1995. The ''Houston Post'' was owned by the family of former Lieutenant Governor [[Bill Hobby]] of Houston. The only other major publication to serve the city is the ''[[Houston Press]]''—which was a free alternative weekly newspaper before the destruction caused by [[Hurricane Harvey]] resulted in the publication switching to an online-only format on November 2, 2017.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.houstonpress.com/news/the-houston-press-shutters-its-print-operation-9931298 |title=Houston Press Shutters Its Print Operation |newspaper=Houston Press |access-date=March 21, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313005143/http://www.houstonpress.com/news/the-houston-press-shutters-its-print-operation-9931298 |archive-date=March 13, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Other notable publications include ''[[Houston Forward Times]]'', ''[[OutSmart]]'', and ''[[La Voz de Houston]]''.

Greater Houston possesses a [[Spoke–hub distribution paradigm|hub-and-spoke]] limited-access highway system, in which a number of freeways radiate outward from Downtown, with [[ring road]]s providing connections between these radial highways at intermediate distances from the city center. The city is crossed by three [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate highways]], [[Interstate 10 in Texas|I-10]], [[Interstate 45|I-45]], and [[Interstate 69 in Texas|I-69]] (commonly known as [[U.S. Route 59 in Texas|US 59]]), as well as a number of other [[United States Numbered Highway System|United States routes]] and [[Texas state highway system|state highways]]. Major freeways in Greater Houston are often referred to by either the cardinal direction or geographic location they travel towards. Highways that follow the cardinal convention include [[U.S. Route 290|US 290]] (''Northwest Freeway''), I-45 north of Downtown (''North Freeway''), I-10 east of Downtown ''(East Freeway''), [[Texas State Highway 288|SH 288]] (''South'' ''Freeway''), and I-69 south of Downtown (''Southwest Freeway''). Highways that follow the location convention include Interstate 10 west of Downtown (''[[Katy, Texas|Katy]] Freeway''), Interstate 69 north of Downtown (''[[East Texas|Eastex]] Freeway''), I-45 south of Downtown (''[[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]] Freeway''), and [[Texas State Highway 225|SH 225]] (''[[Pasadena, Texas|Pasadena]] Freeway''). {{Citation needed|date=October 2023}}

Three loop freeways provide north–south and east–west connectivity between Greater Houston's radial highways. The innermost loop is [[Interstate 610 (Texas)|I-610]], commonly known as the ''Inner Loop'', which encircles Downtown, the [[Texas Medical Center]], [[Greenway Plaza]], the cities of [[West University Place, Texas|West University Place]] and [[Southside Place, Texas|Southside Place]], and many core neighborhoods. The {{Convert|88|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Texas State Highway Beltway 8|Beltway&nbsp;8]], often referred to as ''the Beltway'', forms the middle loop at a radius of roughly {{Convert|10|mi|km}}. A third, {{Convert|180|mi|km|adj=on}} loop with a radius of approximately {{Convert|25|mi|km}}, [[Texas State Highway 99|SH&nbsp;99]] (the ''Grand Parkway''), is currently under construction, with eight of eleven segments completed {{as of|2018|lc=y}}.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |url=https://www.txdot.gov/inside-txdot/projects/studies/houston/sh99-grand-parkway.html |title=SH 99 / Grand Parkway Project |date=2022 |website=Texas Department of Transportation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304020957/https://www.txdot.gov/inside-txdot/projects/studies/houston/sh99-grand-parkway.html|archive-date=March 4, 2018|access-date=May 25, 2022}}</ref> Completed segments D through I-2 provide a continuous {{Convert|123|mi|km|adj=on}} limited-access tollway connection between [[Sugar Land, Texas|Sugar Land]], [[Richmond, Texas|Richmond]], [[Katy, Texas|Katy]], [[Cypress, Texas|Cypress]], [[Spring, Texas|Spring]], [[Porter, Texas|Porter]], [[New Caney, Texas|New Caney]], [[Cleveland, Texas|Cleveland]], [[Dayton, Texas|Dayton]], [[Mont Belvieu, Texas|Mont Belvieu]], and [[Baytown, Texas|Baytown]] .<ref name=":3" />

A system of toll roads, operated by the [[Harris County Toll Road Authority]] and [[Fort Bend County Toll Road Authority]], provides additional options for regional commuters. The Sam Houston Tollway, which encompasses the mainlanes of Beltway 8 (as opposed to the [[Frontage road|frontage road]]s, which are untolled), is the longest tollway in the system, covering the entirety of the Beltway with the exception of a free section between I-45 and I-69 near George Bush Intercontinental Airport. The region is serviced by four spoke tollways: a set of [[Managed lane|managed lane]]s on the Katy Freeway; the [[Hardy Toll Road]], which parallels I-45 north of Downtown up to [[Spring, Texas|Spring]]; the [[Westpark Tollway]], which services Houston's western suburbs out to [[Fulshear, Texas|Fulshear]]; and [[Fort Bend Parkway]], which connects to [[Sienna Plantation, Texas|Sienna Plantation]]. Westpark Tollway and Fort Bend Parkway are operated conjunctly with the Fort Bend County Toll Road Authority.

Greater Houston's freeway system is monitored by Houston TranStar, a partnership of four government agencies which is responsible for providing transportation and [[Emergency management|emergency management]] services to the region.<ref>[http://www.houstontranstar.org/about_transtar/ About Houston TranStar] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205224259/http://www.houstontranstar.org/about_transtar/ |date=February 5, 2012 }}.

Greater Houston's [[Arterial road|arterial road]] network is established at the municipal level, with the City of Houston exercising planning control over both its [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] area and [[Extraterritorial jurisdiction|extraterritorial jurisdiction]]. Therefore, Houston exercises transportation planning authority over a {{Convert|2000|mi2|km2|adj=on}} area over five counties, many times larger than its corporate area.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |url=http://www.houstontx.gov/planning/transportation/docs_pdfs/2015_PolicyStatement.pdf |title=Major Thoroughfare and Freeway Plan Policy Statement |date=March 2015 |website=City of Houston |access-date=March 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321063323/http://www.houstontx.gov/planning/transportation/docs_pdfs/2015_PolicyStatement.pdf |archive-date=March 21, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> The ''Major Thoroughfare and Freeway Plan'', updated annually, establishes the city's [[street hierarchy]], identifies roadways in need of widening, and proposes new roadways in unserved areas.
