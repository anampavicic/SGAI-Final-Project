Before the arrival of Europeans, what became known as the Santa Rosa Plain was home to a strong and populous tribe of [[Pomo]] people known as the Bitakomtara. The Bitakomtara controlled the area closely, barring passage to others until permission was arranged. Those who entered without permission were subject to harsh penalties. The tribe gathered at ceremonial times on Santa Rosa Creek near present-day [[Spring Lake Regional Park]].

Following the arrival of Europeans, initially Spanish explorers and colonists, the Pomos were decimated by violence, land theft, slavery, genocide and [[smallpox]] brought from Europe. Social displacement and disruption followed.  There are descendants of survivors still living in the region today.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Welcome |url=https://native-land.ca/ |access-date=2024-08-29 |website=Native-Land.ca |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=drycreek |title=Dry Creek Rancheria – Band of Pomo Indians |url=https://drycreekrancheria.com/ |access-date=2024-08-29 |website=Dry Creek Rancheria |language=en-US}}</ref>

===19th century===
Santa Rosa was founded in 1833 and named by Mexican colonists after [[Saint Rose of Lima]]. The first known permanent European settlement here was the homestead of the [[Carrillo family of California]], in-laws to [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]], who settled the [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]] [[pueblo]] and [[Petaluma, California|Petaluma]] area. In the 1830s, during the Mexican period, the family of [[María López de Carrillo]] built an adobe house on their [[Rancho Cabeza de Santa Rosa]] land grant, just east of what later became downtown Santa Rosa. By the 1820s, before the Carrillos built their adobe in the 1830s, [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and Mexican settlers from nearby Sonoma and other settlements to the south were known to raise [[livestock]] in the area.

They slaughtered animals at the fork of the [[Santa Rosa Creek]] and [[Matanzas Creek]], near the intersection of modern-day Santa Rosa and Sonoma avenues. This is thought to have been the origin of the name of Matanzas Creek; because it was a slaughtering place, the confluence came to be called ''La Matanza.''

By the 1850s, after the United States annexed [[California]] following its victory in the [[Mexican-American War]], a [[History of Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo]] post and general store were established in what is now downtown Santa Rosa. In the mid-1850s, several prominent locals, including Julio Carrillo, son of Maria Carrillo, laid out the grid street pattern for Santa Rosa with a [[public square]] in the center. This pattern has been largely maintained in downtown to this day, despite changes to the central square, now called Old Courthouse Square.

In 1867, the county recognized Santa Rosa as an [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] city; in 1868, the state officially confirmed the incorporation, making it the third incorporated city in Sonoma County after [[Petaluma]], incorporated in 1858, and [[Healdsburg]], incorporated in 1867.

[[United States Census Bureau]] records show that after California became a state, Santa Rosa grew steadily, though it lagged behind nearby Petaluma in the 1850s and early 1860s. In the [[1870 United States census|1870 census]], Santa Rosa was the eighth-largest city in California, and county seat of one of the most populous counties in the state. Growth and development after that was steady but never rapid. The city continued to grow when other early population centers declined or stagnated, but by 1900 it was being overtaken by many other newer population centers in the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California.

===20th century===
[[File:Santa Rosa, Empire Building (2012).jpg|thumb|The Empire Building, completed in 1910 and a Sonoma County landmark, seen in the film ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], in December 2021]]
By 1900, the Pomo population had decreased by 95%.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lfPfAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA90 |page=90 |title=Sacred Sonoma: Sacred Sites and Alignments in Sonoma County, California |edition=Revised |first=Beth |last=Winegarner |publisher=Lulu |year=2007 |isbn=9781430320678}}</ref>

According to a 1905 article in the ''[[Press Democrat]]'' reporting on the "Battle of the Trains", the city had just over 10,000 people at the time.

The [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] essentially destroyed the entire downtown, but the city's population did not greatly suffer. However, after that period the population growth of Santa Rosa, as with most of the area, was very slow.

Santa Rosa grew following [[World War II]] because it was the location for [[Naval Auxiliary Landing Field Santa Rosa]], the remnants of which are now located in southwest Santa Rosa. The city was a convenient location for San Francisco travelers bound for the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]].

The population increased by two-thirds between 1950 and 1970, an average of 1,000 new residents a year over the 20-year period. Some of the increase was from annexation of portions of the surrounding area.

In 1958, the United States Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization designated Santa Rosa as one of its eight regional headquarters, with jurisdiction over Region 7, which included [[American Samoa]], [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Guam]], [[Hawaii]], [[Nevada]], and [[Utah]]. Santa Rosa continued as a major center for [[United States civil defense|civil defense]] activity (under the Office of Emergency Planning and the Office of Emergency Preparedness) until 1979 when the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) was created in its place, ending the civil defense's 69-year history.<ref name="OEP">{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/396.html|title=Records of the office of Emergency Preparedness|access-date=August 30, 2008}}</ref>

When the City Council adopted the city's first modern General Plan in 1991, the population was about 113,000. In the 21 years following 1970, Santa Rosa grew by about 3,000 residents a year—triple the average growth during the previous twenty years.

''Santa Rosa 2010'', the 1991 General Plan, called for a population of 175,000 in 2010. The Council expanded the city's urban boundary to include all the land then planned for future annexation, and declared it would be Santa Rosa's "ultimate" boundary. The rapid growth that was being criticized as [[urban sprawl]] became routine [[infill]] development.

At the first five-year update of the plan, in 1996, the Council extended the planning period by ten years, renaming it ''Vision 2020'' (updated to ''Santa Rosa 2020'', and then again to ''Santa Rosa 2030 Vision''), and added more land and population.

===Climate===
Santa Rosa has a [[Mediterranean climate#Warm-summer Mediterranean climate|warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csb'') with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers. In the summer, fog and low overcast often move in from the Pacific Ocean during the evenings and mornings. They usually clear up to very warm, sunny weather by late morning or noon before returning in the later evening but will occasionally linger all day. Average annual rainfall is {{convert|32.20|in|mm}}, falling on 74 days annually. The wettest “rain year” was from July 1982 to June 1983 with {{convert|55.66|in|mm|1}} and the driest from July 1976 to June 1977 with {{convert|13.06|in|mm|1}}.

Measurable snowfall is extremely rare in the lowlands, but light amounts sometimes fall in the nearby mountains.

There are an average of 28.9 afternoons with highs of {{convert|90|°F|1}} or more and an average of 30.2 mornings with lows reaching the freezing mark. The record high was {{convert|115|°F|1}} on September 6, 2022, and the record low was {{convert|9|°F|1}} on December 25, 1924.<ref name = NOAA >{{cite web|url = https://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=mtr|title = NowData – NOAA Online Weather Data|publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|access-date = November 2, 2012}}</ref>

===Seismicity===
Santa Rosa lies atop the [[Healdsburg Fault|Healdsburg-Rodgers Creek segment]] of the [[Hayward Fault|Hayward-Rodgers Creek Fault System]]. The Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities estimated a minimum 27 percent chance of a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake on this segment by 2037.<ref name=quake>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.healdsburg.ca.us/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=411 |title=Healdsburg 2030 General Plan Update – Revised Draft Environmental Impact Report – IV.G.

On November 21, 2005, the [[United States Geological Survey]] released a map detailing the results of a new tool that measures ground shaking during an earthquake. The map determined that the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] was most powerful in an area between Santa Rosa and what is now [[Sebastopol, California|Sebastopol]], causing more damage in Santa Rosa (for its size) than any other city affected.<ref name="1906_quake">{{cite press release | title=USGS Produces New Map Showing Detailed Ground Shaking in Great San Francisco Old Maps, even Old Cemeteries, Provide New Clues for Modern Intensity Tool | url=http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=693 | publisher = United States Geoloogical Survey | date=April 14, 2005 |access-date=September 9, 2014}}</ref>

On October 1, 1969, [[1969 Santa Rosa earthquakes|two earthquakes]] of magnitudes 5.6 and 5.7 shook Santa Rosa, damaging about 100 structures. They were the strongest quakes to affect the city since 1906. The epicenters were about {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} north of Santa Rosa.

===Nature and wildlife===
Due to its population, much of Santa Rosa's remaining undisturbed area is on its urban fringe. However, the principal wildlife corridors of [[Santa Rosa Creek]] and its tributaries flow right through the heart of the town. [[Great blue herons]], [[great egret]]s, [[snowy egret]]s and [[black-crowned night heron|black-crowned herons]] nest in the trees of the median strip on West Ninth Street as well as along Santa Rosa Creek and downtown. [[Deer]] often are spotted roaming the neighborhoods nearer the eastern hills, as deep into town as Franklin Avenue and the McDonald area; rafters of [[wild turkeys]] are relatively common in some areas; and [[cougar|mountain lions]] are occasionally observed within city limits. [[Raccoon]]s and [[Virginia opossum|opossum]]s are a common sight throughout the city, while [[fox]]es, and [[rabbit]]s may be regularly seen in the more rural areas. In addition, the city borders and then wraps around the northern end of Trione Annadel State Park, which itself extends into the Sonoma Mountains and Sonoma Valley. [[Trione-Annadel State Park]] also adjoins Spring Lake County Park and Howarth Park, forming one contiguous park system that enables visitors to venture into wild native habitats.

===Neighborhoods===
[[File:Rrsqrazorback.jpg|thumb|Restaurants and other retail stores occupy several historic buildings in Santa Rosa's Railroad Square district in the downtown area, including these along Fourth Street.]]
Santa Rosa can be seen as divided into four quadrants: Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest. [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]] runs roughly north–south through the city, and divides it into east and west sides. [[California State Route 12|State Route 12]] runs roughly east–west, and divides the city into north and south sides.

Acts of crime in these neighborhoods are commonly burglaries, graffiti, and violent gang activity. Street gangs such as [[Sureños]] and [[Norteños]] have large concentrations throughout Santa Rosa. There are multiple other gangs, including mostly racially based gangs or racially mixed that commit theft, street and violent crimes, [[motorcycle gang]]s, [[white supremacist]] gangs, and prison gangs.<ref name="interactive"/><ref name=pressdemo20092>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20090613/ARTICLES/906139924?p=all&tc=pgall |title=South Park, Santa Rosa's vibrant, ever-changing corner |work=The Press Democrat|date=June 13, 2009 |access-date=July 18, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Doyle|first=Jim|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Gang-turf-spreads-to-Santa-Rosa-As-Sonoma-2704443.php#page-2 |title=Gang turf spreads to Santa Rosa |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=January 20, 2005}}</ref> In 2011, there were 5 homicides, 58 rapes, 134 robberies, 485 aggravated assaults, and 637 burglaries.

===Homelessness===
There are at least 2,700 homeless people in Sonoma County. Around 1,500 are in Santa Rosa, about one percent of the city. Downtown Santa Rosa, including its outskirts and the area south of the [[Santa Rosa Plaza|Santa Rosa Mall]] (Wilson and Morgan Street) and Mendocino Avenue area, South Park/Fairgrounds area, Santa Rosa Avenue, West Steele Lane, and the [[Joe Rodota Trail]]/Stony Point districts and neighborhoods have been concentrations of homeless people since the 2000s. Homeless services can be found in the Wilson Street area.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/who-makes-up-sonoma-countys-homeless-population/amp/|title=Who Makes Up Sonoma County's Homeless Population|publisher=[[Press Democrat]]|date=May 18, 2021}}</ref>

==Economy==
''Forbes'' Magazine ranked the Santa Rosa metropolitan area 185th out of 200 on its 2007 list of Best Places For Business And Careers.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/1/07bestplaces_Santa-Rosa-CA_2386.html|magazine=Forbes.com|title=#185 Santa Rosa CA|access-date=September 10, 2014}}</ref> It was second on the list five years earlier. It was downgraded because of an increase in the cost of doing business, and reduced job growth—both blamed on increases in the cost of housing.

[[File:SR vineyard.jpg|thumb|While the most expansive vineyards in [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma County]] are in the [[Alexander Valley|Alexander]], [[Russian River Valley|Russian]], and [[Sonoma Valley|Sonoma]] Valleys, Santa Rosa is home to several vineyards, including this one near Fountain Grove.]]
[[File:Hotel La Rose, Downtown Santa Rosa, California,2.jpg|thumb|[[Hotel La Rose]], built in 1907, is a functioning historic hotel in downtown Santa Rosa.]]
Santa Rosa sits at the northwestern gateway to the Sonoma and Napa Valleys of California's famed Wine Country. Many [[winery|wineries]] and [[vineyard]]s are nearby, as well as the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]] resort area, the Sonoma Coast along the Pacific Ocean, [[Jack London State Historic Park]], and the [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] trees of [[Armstrong Redwoods State Reserve]].

The City Council pays the Santa Rosa Chamber of Commerce to operate the Santa Rosa Convention & Visitors Bureau.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitsantarosa.com/|website=Visitsantarosa.com|title=Santa Rosa Convention and Visitors Bureau|access-date=September 10, 2014}}</ref> The Chamber's visitors center is in the city-owned old railroad depot at the bottom of Fourth Street, in Historic Railroad Square. The SRC&VB has been a California Welcome Center since 2003.

Downtown Santa Rosa, including the central Old Courthouse Square and historic Railroad Square, is an area of shopping, restaurants, nightclubs, and theaters. Downtown also includes City Hall, state and federal office buildings, many banks, and professional offices. The [[Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital]] medical center is just to the east of downtown.

Although there are co-op network atms and several credit unions, there is no shared branching for credit unions in Santa Rosa.<ref>{{cite web |title=CO-OP Network ATM Locations {{!}} CO-OP Financial Services |url=https://www.co-opfs.org/Shared-Branches-ATMs |website=www.co-opfs.org |access-date=August 29, 2020}}</ref>

The city council funds a private booster group, Santa Rosa Main Street, which lobbies the city to revitalize the traditional business district. Three new mixed-use, high-rise buildings, and a new city parking garage, are under development. (WHEN?) The council and downtown business boosters hope condos atop the new buildings will house a population to keep the area active 24 hours a day.

The nearby cities and towns of [[Bodega Bay, California|Bodega Bay]], [[Calistoga, California|Calistoga]], [[Guerneville, California|Guerneville]], [[Healdsburg, California|Healdsburg]], [[Petaluma, California|Petaluma]], [[Sebastopol, California|Sebastopol]], [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]], and [[Windsor, California|Windsor]] are popular with tourists and readily accessible from Santa Rosa.

Railroad Square is the portion of downtown that is on the west side of [[U.S. Route 101]] and has the highest concentration of historic commercial buildings. Of particular note are the four rough-hewn stone buildings at its core, two of which are rare in that they predate the 1906 earthquake. They include the old [[Northwestern Pacific Railroad]] depot, prominently seen in the beginning and the end of the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'', and the still-functioning [[Hotel La Rose]], built in 1907 and registered as one of the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]]'s [[Historic Hotels of America]]. The area contains numerous other historic buildings, such as the former [[Petaluma and Santa Rosa Railroad]] depot, and the Lee Bros. Building, both at the corner of 4th and Wilson Streets. Near it in the West End district are numerous other old buildings, including not only many old houses but the masonry DeTurk Winery complex, dating to the 1880s–1890s, and the DeTurk [[round barn]]. Also of note nearby is the former [[Del Monte Foods|Del Monte]] Cannery Building, built in 1894. One of the oldest surviving commercial buildings in town, it was renovated into the 6th Street Playhouse in 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dramabiz.com/search.php?mode=found&id=164|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120904230517/http://www.dramabiz.com/search.php?mode=found&id=164|title=DramaBiz magazine – Search Page<!-- Bot generated title -->|archivedate=September 4, 2012}}</ref>

==Representation in other media==
Director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] filmed his thriller ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' in Santa Rosa in 1943; the film gives glimpses of Santa Rosa in the 1940s. Many of the downtown buildings seen in the film no longer exist, as there was major reconstruction in the late 20th century following the strong [[1969 Santa Rosa earthquakes|earthquakes in October 1969]]. But the rough-stone [[Northwestern Pacific Railroad]] depot and the prominent Empire Building (built in 1910 with a gold-topped clock tower) still survive. A scene at the bank was filmed at the corner of Fourth Street and Mendocino Avenue (at present-day Old Courthouse square); the [[S. H. Kress & Co.|Kress]] building on Fourth Street is also visible. The courthouse and bank are now gone. The Coen brothers' film ''[[The Man Who Wasn't There (2001 film)|The Man Who Wasn't There]]'' (2001) is set in Santa Rosa {{Circa|1949}}.
