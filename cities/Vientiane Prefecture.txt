'''Vientiane Prefecture''' ({{langx|lo|ນະຄອນຫຼວງວຽງຈັນ}}, ''Nakhônlouang ViangChan'', {{IPA-lo|nā(ʔ).kʰɔ́ːn lǔaŋ wíaŋ tɕàn|pron}}, {{RTGS|''Nakhon Luang Wiang Chan''}}) is a prefecture of [[Laos]], in northwest Laos. The national capital, [[Vientiane]], is in the prefecture. The prefecture was created in 1989, when it was split off from [[Vientiane province]].<ref name=Vientiane>{{Cite web|url=http://www.laotourism.org/vientiane%20municipality.htm|title=Vientiane Municipality|access-date=2 December 2012|publisher=Official Website of Lao Tourism|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026001350/http://laotourism.org/vientiane%20municipality.htm|archive-date=26 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On a curve of the [[Mekong River]], and bordering [[Thailand]], the prefecture covers an area of {{Convert|3920|km2|sqmi|-1|abbr=on}}. Vientiane city was built in the 16th century in the reign of King Saysethathirath. The older part of the city has ancient temples, museums, monuments and parks.<ref name=Vientiane/>

Protected areas in the prefecture include Phou Khao Khouay National Protected Area, Phou Phanang National Protected Area, and Houay Ngang Forest Reserve, a good area for bird and butterfly watching.<ref name=eco>{{Cite web|url=http://ecotourismlaos.com/vientianecapital.htm|title=Vientiane Capital Province|access-date=2 December 2012|publisher=Eco Tourism, Laos|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829063746/http://www.ecotourismlaos.com/vientianecapital.htm|archive-date=29 August 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The prefecture is the site of the [[First Thai–Lao Friendship Bridge]] spanning the Mekong to connect with [[Nong Khai Province]], Thailand and
the [[New Laos National Stadium]] open 2009 at [[Route 13 (Laos)|Route 13]].

==History==
The Laotian epic, the ''[[Phra Lak Phra Lam]]'', claims that Prince Thattaradtha founded the city when he left the legendary Lao kingdom of ''Muong Inthapatha Maha Nakhone'' because he was denied the throne in favor of his younger brother.{{sfn|Fanthorpe|2009|p=66}} Thattaradtha founded a city called ''Maha Thani Si Phan Phao'' on the west bank of the Mekong; this city was said to have later become today's [[Udon Thani]], [[Thailand]].{{sfn|Võ|1972|p=21}} One day, a seven-headed [[Naga (mythology)|Naga]] told Thattaradtha to start a new city on the east bank of the river opposite ''Maha Thani Si Phan Phao''.{{sfn|Fanthorpe|2009|p=66}}  The prince called this city ''Chanthabuly Si Sattanakhanahud'',  which was said to be the predecessor of modern Vientiane.{{sfn|Võ|1972|p=21}}

Contrary to the ''Phra Lak Phra Ram'', most historians believe that the city of Vientiane was an early [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] settlement centered around a [[Hindu]] temple, which the ''Pha That Luang'' would later replace. Khmer princes ruling [[Say Fong]] were known to have made pilgrimages to the shrine near Vientiane.{{sfn|Askew, Logan & Long|2009|p=21}} In the 11th and 12th centuries, the time when the [[Lao people|Lao]] and [[Thai people]] are believed to have entered [[Southeast Asia]] from [[southern China]], the few remaining Khmer in the area were either killed, removed, or assimilated into the Lao civilization, which would soon overtake the area.{{sfn|Grabowski|1995|p=111}}

In 1354, when [[Fa Ngum]] founded the kingdom of [[Lan Xang]], Vientiane became an important administrative city, even though it was not made the capital.{{sfn|Askew, Logan & Long|2009|p=37}} King [[Setthathirath]] established it as the capital of Lan Xang in 1563, to avoid a Burmese invasion.{{sfn|Grabowski|1995|p=111}} In the following several centuries Vientiane's position was not stable; at times it was strong and regional centre but often it came under the control of Vietnam, Burma, or Siam.{{sfn|Burke|Vaisutis|2007|p=91-98}}

[[Image:Vat Sisaket Gal.JPG|thumb|right|[[Wat Si Saket]]]]

When Lan Xang fell apart in 1707, it became an independent [[Kingdom of Vientiane]].{{sfn|Kislenko|2009|p=24}} In 1779, it was conquered by the Siamese general Phraya [[Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke|Chakri]] and made a vassal of [[Thailand|Siam]].{{sfn|Grabowski|1995|p=111}} When King [[Anouvong]] tried to assert himself as an independent kingdom, and raised an unsuccessful rebellion, it was obliterated by [[Thai people|Siamese]] armies in 1827.{{sfn|Lee|2007|p=27}} The city was burned to the ground and was looted of nearly all Laotian artifacts, including Buddha statues.<ref name="Summary of World Broadcasts: Far East">{{cite book|title=Summary of World Broadcasts: Far East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=etmZAAY73XEC|access-date=30 November 2012|year=1987|publisher=Monitoring Service of the British Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref>{{sfn|Burke|Vaisutis|2007|p=91-98}} The Siamese routed Anouvong and razed the city leaving only [[Wat Si Saket]] in good shape.{{sfn|Burke|Vaisutis|2007|p=91-98}} Vientiane was in ruins, depopulated, and disappearing into the forest when the French arrived in 1867. It eventually passed to French rule in 1893. It became the capital of the French protectorate of Laos in 1899.{{sfn|Doeden|2007|p=30}} The French rebuilt the city and repaired Buddhist temples such as ''Pha That Luang'', ''[[Haw Phra Kaew]]'', and built colonial buildings. By a decree signed in 1900 by Governor-General [[Paul Doumer]], the province was divided into four [[Canton (country subdivision)|''muang'']]: Borikan, Patchoum, Tourakom, and Vientiane. Two years earlier, men from these four ''muang'' were responsible for building a house for the first administrator of [[Vientiane]], Pierre Morin.{{sfn|Askew, Logan & Long|2009|p=77}}

During [[World War II]], Vientiane fell with little resistance to Japanese forces, under the command of Sako Masanori. On 9 March 1945 French paratroopers arrived, and liberated Vientiane on 24 April 1945.{{sfn|Eur|2002|p=736}}

As the [[Laotian Civil War]] broke out between the [[Royal Lao Government]] and the [[Pathet Lao]], Vientiane became unstable. In August 1960, [[Kong Le]] seized the capital and insisted that [[Souvanna Phouma]], become prime minister. In mid-December, General Phoumi then seized the capital, overthrew the Phouma government, and installed [[Boun Oum]] as prime minister. In mid-1975, Pathet Lao troops moved towards the city and US personnel began evacuating the capital. On 23 August 1975, a contingent of 50 Pathet Lao women liberated the city.{{sfn|Eur|2002|p=736}} On 2 December 1975, the [[Communism|communist]] party of the [[Pathet Lao]] took over Vientiane and defeated the [[Kingdom of Laos]], thus ending the [[Laotian Civil War]], but an [[insurgency in Laos]] began in the jungle, with the Pathet Lao fighting the [[Hmong people|Hmongs]] and royalists-in-exile.

In the mid-1980s, there was growing concern regarding unplanned and uncontrolled urban growth, leading to the founding of the Urban Development Program of Vientiane Prefecture (UCP).{{sfn|Askew|Logan|2007|p=195}} Prior to the mid-1990s, the prefecture was led by a government which included fourteen departments. These were branches of national ministry offices. The prefecture was unable to collect taxes. Whatever revenues were collected were subsequently transferred to the national government.{{sfn|Askew|Logan|2007|p=197}} In 1993, the Vientiane Urban Planning Committee (VUPC) became the highest decision-making organization in the prefecture; it was governed by a chairman, deputy chair, and eight members.{{sfn|Brockman|Williams|1996|p=423}} In 1999, the Vientiane Urban Development and Administration Authority (VUDAA) was established at the prefecture level to manage the city's development.{{sfn|Askew|Logan|2007|p=197}} The St. Paul Foundation built in 2001 and a Vocational School for the Disabled in Ban Sikeud in Vientiane Prefecture.{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|2002|p=557}}

The Houay Ngang Forest Reserve, within Vientiane, has many species of birds and butterflies. A nature trail in the reserve is used for a day tour where the Ban Pako ecolodge is available overlooking the [[Nam Ngum River]]. Its approach is from Ban Pako by boat across the river. Dong Dok University in association with [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|GTZ]] has developed the forest walk.<ref name=eco/> The [[Nam Leuk]] and [[Nam Gnong]] Rivers also flow through the prefecture.{{sfn|Chandler|Holmshaw|Stewart|Waters|2011|p=147}}
