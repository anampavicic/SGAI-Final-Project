'''Consolacion''', officially the '''Municipality of Consolacion''' ({{lang-ceb|Lungsod sa Consolacion}}; {{lang-tgl|Bayan ng Consolacion}}),  is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Cebu]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 148,012 people.{{PH census|current}}

Consolacion is bordered on the north by the town of [[Liloan, Cebu|Liloan]], to the west by [[Cebu City]], on the east by the [[Camotes Sea]], and on the south by the city of [[Mandaue, Cebu|Mandaue]]. It is {{convert|12|km}} from Cebu City and {{convert|5|km}} from Mandaue.

==Etymology==
The town's name came from the name of daughter, ''Consolacion,'' of the then-[[Governor of Cebu|Cebu governor]] when it was re-established as an independent municipality in 1920.

== History ==
Consolacion was a component barangay first founded in 1871 with a population of 14,248.  Before this, it was only a [[barrio]] of the municipality of [[Mandaue]]. The barrio, formerly named "Kampi-ig" named after a kind of crab living in mangroves, which was abundant in the area,  became a separate town in 1871. However, in 1902 and 1903, unable to maintain its status as an independent municipality, it reverted to Mandaue.

In 1920, Consolacion was again made an independent municipality after a petition was accepted by the governor. So grateful were the townspeople to the Cebuano governor that they named their new town after his daughter – Consolacion – and they also chose [[Narcissus of Jerusalem|San Narciso]] as their [[patron saint]], the namesake of the governor's wife, Narcisa.

A year after the construction of the ''Casa Real'' or municipal hall, the people built their first church. Because it was made of wood, nipa, and bamboo, it was totally destroyed by a typhoon in 1888. A second one was also destroyed by a typhoon in 1892. A third one was built just before [[World War II]], on its current site.

The present municipal hall is already the third one. The first was destroyed by the typhoon of 1892. The second one was also destroyed, by the Japanese during [[World War II]]. Today, Consolacion is a robust residential urban municipality with a vigorous economy, providing a place to live for people employed in the neighboring cities of Mandaue, [[Lapu-Lapu, Philippines|Lapu-Lapu]] and [[Cebu]].

== Geography ==
[[File:Cebu coastline from the air (49537057808).jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Consolacion]]
70% of the total area of the town is above or highland mountains and 18% foreshore land. The contours are irregular and the highest point is about {{convert|500|m|sp=us}} above sea level.

=== Barangays ===
Consolacion is politically subdivided into 21 barangays. Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s and some have [[sitios]].

===Sarok Festival===
The Sarok Festival is celebrated on Consolacion's foundation day. Sarok is a hat made of bamboo strips and dried banana leaves. Sarok Festival a Mardi Gras of colors and street dancing along the main road of Consolacion is celebrated every February 14 in commemoration of Consolacion founding anniversary. The main attraction of this festival is the colorful Sarok and its wide uses.

;History
To protect farmers and the folks from the sun and the rain, the sarok, a conical hat made from bamboo strips and dried banana leaves, becomes the needed fad for the people of Consolacion especially that the town is an agricultural land. The festival was traditionally celebrated every February 14 to coincide with its charter day celebrations but this now celebrated in October. However, the Sarok Festival evolved into a free interpretation dance, with the musical concept inspired from the Miligoy de Cebu, a published Filipino folk dance originating from the same place.

;Contribution to Cultural Heritage
Consolacion is one of the contributor in Cultural History. It had created a dance called "Miligoy de Cebu". This dance is usually performed by pairs of dancers during social gatherings like baptism, weddings, and special programs in the poblacion. Dancers hold a pair of bamboo castanets in each hand.{{sfn|Fun-Philippines|2014}}{{sfn|Cebu Daily News|2014}}
