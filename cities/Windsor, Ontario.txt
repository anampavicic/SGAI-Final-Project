'''Windsor''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɪ|n|d|z|ɚ}} {{respell|WIND|zer}}) is a city in [[southwestern Ontario]], Canada, on the south bank of the [[Detroit River]] directly across from [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], United States. Geographically located within but administratively independent of [[Essex County, Ontario|Essex County]], it is the southernmost city in Canada and marks the southwestern end of the [[Quebec City–Windsor Corridor]]. The city's population was 229,660 at the [[2021 Canadian Census|2021 census]], making it the third-most populated city in Southwestern Ontario, after [[London, Ontario|London]] and [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]]. This represents a 5.7 percent<ref>{{Cite web |title=Demographics {{!}} City of Windsor |url=https://www.citywindsor.ca/residents/planning/plans-and-community-information/about-windsor/demographics |access-date=2024-06-26 |website=www.citywindsor.ca |language=en}}</ref> increase from Windsor's 2016 population census of 217,188. The [[Detroit–Windsor]] urban area is North America's most populous trans-border [[conurbation]].  Linking the [[Great Lakes Megalopolis]], the [[Ambassador Bridge]] border crossing is the busiest commercial crossing on the [[Canada–United States border]].

Windsor is a major contributor to [[Automotive industry in Canada|Canada's automotive industry]] and is culturally diverse. Known as the "Automotive Capital of Canada", Windsor's industrial and manufacturing heritage is responsible for how the city has developed through the years.

[[File:mackenziehall.jpg|thumb|left|Mackenzie Hall]]

===Early settlement===
At the time when the first Europeans arrived in the 17th century, the Detroit River region was inhabited by the [[Huron people|Huron]], [[Odawa]], [[Potawatomi]] and [[Iroquois]] [[First Nations in Canada|First Nations]].<ref name="teasdale">{{Cite journal |last=Teasdale |first=Guillaume |date=2012 |title=Old Friends and New Foes: French Settlers and Indians in the Detroit River Border Region |journal=Michigan Historical Review |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=35–62 |doi=10.5342/michhistrevi.38.2.0035}}</ref> The land along the Detroit River was part of the [[Council of Three Fires|Three Fires Confederacy]] between the [[Ojibwe]], Potawatomi, and Odawa and was referred to as ''Wawiiatanong'' or ''Wawiiatanong Ziibi'' meaning "where the river bends" in [[Anishinaabemowin]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of Sandwich |url=https://www.citywindsor.ca/residents/historyofwindsor/history-of-sandwich/Pages/default.aspx#:~:text=Before%20Europeans%20arrived%2C%20the%20land,%2C%20and%20Odawa%20(Ottawa) |access-date=2022-02-21 |website=Citywindsor.ca |archive-date=September 26, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926230044/https://citywindsor.ca/residents/historyofwindsor/history-of-sandwich/Pages/default.aspx#:~:text=Before%20Europeans%20arrived%2C%20the%20land,%2C%20and%20Odawa%20(Ottawa) |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Israelson |first=David |date=February 9, 2021 |title=Transforming a 70s law school to reflect changing student and social demographics |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/industry-news/property-report/article-transforming-a-70s-law-school-to-reflect-changing-student-and-social/ |access-date=February 21, 2022 |website=Theglobeandmail.com |archive-date=February 14, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220214174437/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/industry-news/property-report/article-transforming-a-70s-law-school-to-reflect-changing-student-and-social/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Later settlement===
A French agricultural settlement was established at the site of Windsor in 1749. It is the oldest continually inhabited European-founded settlement in Canada west of [[Montreal]]. The area was first named ''la Petite Côte'' ("Little Coast"—as opposed to the longer coastline on the Detroit side of the river). Later it was called ''La Côte de Misère'' ("Poverty Coast") because of the sandy soils near [[LaSalle, Ontario|LaSalle]].

Windsor's [[French Canadian|French-Canadian]] heritage is reflected in French street names such as Ouellette, Drouillard, Pelissier, François, Pierre, Langlois, Marentette, and Lauzon. The current street system (a grid with elongated blocks) reflects the ''Canadien'' method of agricultural land division, where the farms were long and narrow, fronting along the river. Today, the name of the north–south street often shows the name of the family that farmed the land where the street is today. The street system of outlying areas is consistent with the British system for granting land [[concession road|concessions]]. There is a sizeable French-speaking minority in Windsor and the surrounding area, particularly in the [[Lakeshore, Ontario|Lakeshore]], [[Tecumseh, Ontario|Tecumseh]] and [[LaSalle, Ontario|LaSalle]] areas.

[[File:Duff Baby House.jpg|thumb|left|[[Duff-Baby House]]]]
In 1797, after the [[American Revolution]], the settlement of "Sandwich" was established. It was later renamed Windsor, after the [[Windsor, Berkshire|town in Berkshire, England]]. The Sandwich neighbourhood on Windsor's west side is home to some of the city's oldest buildings, including Mackenzie Hall, originally built as the Essex County Courthouse in 1855. Today, this building is a community centre. The city's oldest building is the [[Duff-Baby House]], built in 1792. It is owned by [[Ontario Heritage Trust]] and houses government offices.

===19th century===
[[File:Sandwich Township in 1881, Essex County Ontario.jpg|thumb|left|Windsor as depicted in an 1881 map of East and West Sandwich Township. From the ''Illustrated atlas of the Dominion of Canada''.]]

The [[François Baby House]] in downtown Windsor was built in 1812 and houses [[Windsor's Community Museum]] dedicated to local history.

Windsor was the site of [[Battle of Windsor|a battle]] during the 1838 [[Upper Canada Rebellion]]. It was attacked by a band of 400 Americans and rebels from Detroit who burned a steamboat and two or three houses before being routed by the local militia.<ref name="auto">{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

[[File:Underground Railroad Monument - Windsor, Ontario.JPG|thumb|right|Underground Railroad Monument]]
In 1846, Windsor had a population of about 300. Two steamboats offered service to Detroit. The barracks were still in operation. There were various tradespeople and other occupations, including bank agencies and post offices.<ref name="auto" /> The city's access to the Canada–US border made it an essential stop for refugee enslaved people gaining freedom in the northern United States along the [[Underground Railroad]]. Many went across the Detroit River to Windsor to escape pursuit by slave catchers.<ref name="Chadwick">{{Cite book |last=Chadwick |first=Bruce |url=https://archive.org/details/travelingundergr00chad/page/272 |title=Traveling the underground railroad: a visitor's guide to more than 300 sites |publisher=Carol Pub.

Windsor was incorporated as a village in 1854 (the same year the village was connected to the rest of Canada by the [[Grand Trunk Railway]]/[[Canadian National Railway]]), then became a town in 1858, and gained city status in 1892.

The [[Windsor Police Service]] was established on July 1, 1867.

A fire consumed much of Windsor's downtown core on October 12, 1871, destroying over 100 buildings.<ref name="Timeline">{{Cite web |year=2002 |title=The Timeline: Fire of 1871 |url=http://209.202.75.197/digi/chi/timeline.asp?Lang=english |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026073802/http://209.202.75.197/digi/chi/drawpage.asp?RelationID=fire |archive-date=2007-10-26 |access-date=2008-03-14 |website=Settling Canada's South: How Windsor Was Made |publisher=[[Windsor Public Library]]}}</ref>

The ''Windsor Star'' Centennial Edition in 1992 covered the city's past, its success as a railway centre, and its contributions to [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] fighting efforts. It also recalled the naming controversy in 1892 when Windsor aimed to become a city. The most popular names listed in the naming controversy were ''South Detroit'', ''The Ferry'' (from the ferries that linked Windsor to Detroit), ''Windsor'', and Richmond (the runner-up in popularity). ''Windsor'' was chosen to promote the heritage of new English settlers in the city and to recognize [[Windsor Castle]] in Berkshire, England. However, ''Richmond'' was a popular name used until World War II, mainly by the local post office.

===20th century===
[[Sandwich, Ontario|Sandwich]], [[Ford City, Ontario|Ford City]] and [[Walkerville, Ontario|Walkerville]] were separate legal entities (towns) until 1935. They are now historic [[Neighbourhoods of Windsor, Ontario|neighbourhoods of Windsor]]. Ford City was incorporated as a village in 1912; it became a town in 1915 and a city in 1929. Walkerville was incorporated as a town in 1890. Sandwich was established in 1817 as a town with no municipal status. It was incorporated as a town in 1858 (the same year as neighbouring Windsor).

Windsor annexed these three towns in 1935. The nearby villages of [[Neighbourhoods of Windsor, Ontario#Ojibway|Ojibway]] and [[Neighbourhoods of Windsor, Ontario#Riverside|Riverside]] were incorporated in 1913 and 1921, respectively. Both were annexed by Windsor in 1966.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of Windsor |url=https://citywindsor.ca/residents/historyofwindsor/Pages/default.aspx |access-date=July 24, 2018 |website=Citywindsor.ca |publisher=City of Windsor |df=mdy-all |archive-date=July 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725003037/https://citywindsor.ca/residents/historyofwindsor/Pages/default.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref> During the 1920s, alcohol prohibition was enforced in Michigan while alcohol was legal in Ontario. [[Rum-running in Windsor]] was a common practice then.

On October 25, 1960, a massive gas explosion destroyed the building housing the [[Metropolitan Stores|Metropolitan Store]] on Ouellette Avenue. Ten people were killed, and at least one hundred were injured.<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 22, 2007 |title=1960 Explosion Remembered |url=http://www.windsorfire.com/1960-explosion-remembered/ |access-date=2017-12-02 |publisher=Windsor Fire and Rescue Services |archive-date=December 3, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203153856/http://www.windsorfire.com/1960-explosion-remembered/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The ''[[Windsor Star]]'' commemorated the 45th anniversary of the event on October 25, 2005.

[[File:Riverfrontwalk windsor.jpg|thumb|right|]]Winters in Windsor are cold. The January mean temperature averages  {{convert|-3.6|°C|°F}} Airport, {{convert|-2.9|°C|°F}} Downtown.<ref name=climate/> Occasional bitter cold outbreaks do occur, often accompanied by [[wind chill]]s exacerbating the feel to exposed skin, these tend to be short-lived. The city occasionally sees lake-effect snow that originates from distant Lake Michigan. Snow cover is intermittent throughout the winter; on average, there are 46 days each year with at least some measurable snow falling. There are typically three to five major snowfalls each winter.
Summers are very warm to hot and humid,<ref name=windsorclimate/> with a July mean temperature of {{convert|23.2|°C|°F|0}} Airport, {{convert|23.8|°C|°F|0}} Downtown (with the highest climatological Summer mean temperature average in Canada). 
The humidex (combined feel of temperature and humidity) reaches {{convert|30|°C|°F}} or higher on over 70 days in an average summer; the highest recorded humidex in Ontario of {{convert|52.1|°C|°F}}, occurred on June 20, 1953 in Windsor. Thunderstorms are common during summer and occur on average 32 days per year, some of them severe with high winds, heavy rainfall, flooding, intense lightning, hail and less often, tornadic activity<ref name=windsorclimate/><ref name="climate" /> Windsor has the highest number of days per year with lightning, haze, and daily maximum humidex over {{convert|30|°C|°F}} of cities in Canada.<ref name="weatherwinners">{{Cite web|title=Weather Winners|url=https://www.weatherstats.ca/winners.html?location=windsor;category=14|access-date=April 26, 2020|publisher=Environment Canada|archive-date=April 14, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414162620/https://www.weatherstats.ca/winners.html?location=windsor;category=14|url-status=live}}</ref> Windsor has Canada's warmest climatological Fall season, with the highest mean temperatures for September, October and November.<ref name=weatherwinners/>  Precipitation is generally well-distributed throughout the year, on average driest in February, wettest in July.

=== Flooding and other emergencies===
Windsor experienced historic flooding in 2016, 2017 and 2019.

A previous state of emergency in Windsor was called in 2013 when a fire broke out at a [[plastic recycling]] warehouse.

In late August 2017, Windsor faced a storm that left {{convert|285|mm}} of rain in 32 hours.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2017-12-21 |title=Windsor flooding makes list of Top 10 weather events in 2017 |language=en-US |work=Windsor Star |url=https://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/windsor-makes-list-of-top-10-weather-events-in-2017 |access-date=2018-11-10 |archive-date=November 10, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181110081957/https://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/windsor-makes-list-of-top-10-weather-events-in-2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Tornadoes===
As the Canadian city with the highest number of days that experience severe [[thunderstorms]] and [[lightning]], Windsor has historically been subject to [[tornadoes]] and severe weather. Notably, Windsor is located in the middle of "Tornado Alley".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Canada's 'Tornado Alley' runs through Windsor and Essex County |url=https://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/canadas-tornado-alley-runs-through-windsor-and-essex-county |access-date=2022-08-11 |website=windsorstar |language=en-CA |archive-date=May 21, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220521210515/https://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/canadas-tornado-alley-runs-through-windsor-and-essex-county/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The strongest and deadliest tornado to touch down in Windsor was an [[Windsor - Tecumseh, Ontario Tornado of 1946|F4]] in 1946.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2014 |title=Deadly skies: Canada's most destructive tornadoes |url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/environment/extreme-weather/deadly-skies-canadas-most-destructive-tornadoes/1946-windsor-tornado.html |access-date=2014-05-02 |publisher=CBC Digital Archives |archive-date=January 1, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101174236/http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/environment/extreme-weather/deadly-skies-canadas-most-destructive-tornadoes/1946-windsor-tornado.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Windsor was the only Canadian city to experience a tornado during the [[1974 Super Outbreak]], an F3 which killed nine people when it destroyed the Windsor Curling Club. The city was grazed by the [[1997 Southeast Michigan tornado outbreak]], with one tornado (an F1) forming east of the city. Tornadoes have been recorded crossing the [[Detroit River]] (in 1946 and 1997), and [[waterspouts]] are regularly seen over [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]] and [[Lake Erie]], especially in autumn.

On April 25, 2009, an F0 tornado briefly touched down in the eastern part of the city, causing minor damage to nearby buildings, most notably a [[CUPE]] [[Trade union|union hall]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2011-12-06 |title=Environment Canada |url=http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/warnings/SWS_bulletins_e.html?prov=on |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030230915/http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/warnings/SWS_bulletins_e.html?prov=on |archive-date=October 30, 2012 |access-date=2012-01-02 |website=Weatheroffice.gc.ca |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

{{Main|Parks in Windsor, Ontario}}

Ouellette Avenue is the historic main commercial street in downtown Windsor. It runs north–south, perpendicular to the Detroit River, and divides the city into east and west sections. Roads that cross Ouellette Avenue include the directional components East and West after their names. Address numbers on east–west roads in Windsor increase by 100 for each block travelled away from Ouellette Avenue and address numbers on north–south roads increase by 100 for each block travelled away from the Detroit River. In areas where the river curves, some numbers on north–south roads are skipped. For consistency across the city, all address numbers on north–south roads reset at either 600 for streets west of Walker Road or 800 for those to the east, where the road crosses Wyandotte Street (which roughly parallels the Detroit River).

The largest park is Mic Mac Park, which can accommodate many activities, including baseball, soccer, biking, and sledding. Windsor has numerous bike trails, the largest being the Ganatchio Trail on the city's far east side. In recent years, the city council has pushed for adding bicycle lanes on city streets to provide links throughout the existing trail network.

The Windsor trail network is linked to the [[LaSalle, Ontario|LaSalle]] Trail in the west end and is to eventually be connected to the [[Chrysler Canada Greenway]] (part of the [[Trans Canada Trail]]). The current greenway is a {{convert|42|km|abbr=on}} former railway corridor converted into a multi-use recreational trail, underground utility corridor and natural green space. It begins south of Oldcastle and continues south through McGregor, Harrow, Kingsville, and Ruthven. The Greenway is a fine trail for hiking, biking, running, birding, cross-country skiing and, in some areas, horseback riding. It connects natural areas, rich agricultural lands, historically and architecturally significant structures, and award-winning wineries. A separate {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} landscaped trail traverses the riverfront between downtown and the Ambassador Bridge. Part of this trail winds through Windsor Sculpture Park, which displays various modern and post-modern sculptures. Families of elephants (see picture), penguins, horses, and many other themed sculptures are found in the park. Some other popular exhibits include the Chicken and Egg, Consophia, and Eve's Apple.

==Economy==
Windsor's economy is primarily based on manufacturing, tourism, education, and government services.

The city is one of Canada's major automobile manufacturing centres and is home to the headquarters of [[Stellantis Canada]]. Automotive facilities include the Stellantis Canada minivan [[Windsor Assembly|assembly plant]], two [[Ford Motor Company]] engine plants, and several [[tool and die]] and automotive parts manufacturers.

Windsor has a well-established tourism industry. [[Caesars Windsor]], one of the largest casinos in Canada, ranks as one of the largest local employers. It has been a significant draw for U.S. visitors since opening in 1994 (as Casino Windsor). Further, the {{convert|1150|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Quebec City – Windsor Corridor]] contains 18&nbsp;million people, with 51% of the Canadian population and three out of the five [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|largest metropolitan areas]], according to the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Census]].

The city has an extensive riverfront parks system and fine restaurants, such as those on Erie Street in Windsor's Little Italy, "Via Italia". This is another popular tourist destination. The Lake Erie North Shore Wine Region in [[Essex County, Ontario|Essex County]] has enhanced tourism in the region.

Both the [[University of Windsor]] and [[St. Clair College]] are significant local employers and have enjoyed substantial growth and expansion in recent years. A full-program satellite medical school of the [[University of Western Ontario]] at the University of Windsor opened in 2008. In 2013, the university completed construction of a $112 million (~${{Format price|{{Inflation|index=US-GDP|value=112000000|start_year=2013}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US-GDP}}) facility for its Faculty of Engineering.

Windsor is the headquarters of Hiram Walker & Sons Limited, now owned by [[Pernod Ricard]]. [[Hiram Walker]] founded its historic [[distillery]] in 1858 in what was then [[Walkerville, Ontario]].

The diversifying economy is also represented by companies involved in [[pharmaceuticals]], alternative energy, insurance, internet, and software. Windsor is also home to the [[Windsor Salt Mine]] and the Great Lakes Regional office of the [[International Joint Commission]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Great Lakes Regional Office Staff |url=http://www.ijc.org/en_/Great_Lakes_Regional_Office_Staff |access-date=2018-07-22 |website=Ijc.org |language=en |archive-date=July 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180712174859/http://www.ijc.org/en_/Great_Lakes_Regional_Office_Staff |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Poverty===

Due to a strong reliance on the manufacturing sector, Windsor has experienced high levels of poverty and unemployment in a number of its ten wards, including a 33% rate of children living under the poverty line based on Statistics Canada. It has the highest rates in Southwestern Ontario, and one of Windsor's electoral districts, Windsor West, ranks 13th highest in poverty rates amongst the 338 federal ridings of Canada.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/child-poverty-rates-in-windsor-west-among-the-worst-in-canada-says-report | title=Child poverty rates in Windsor West among the worst in Canada, says report | access-date=June 28, 2022 | archive-date=October 20, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221020025027/https://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/child-poverty-rates-in-windsor-west-among-the-worst-in-canada-says-report | url-status=live }}</ref> Wards 2 (Sandwich/University District/West End) and 3 (City Centre) register some of the highest poverty rates at 44.65% and 44.94%.

Windsor's history as an industrial centre has given the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party (NDP)]] a dedicated voting base. During federal and provincial elections, Windsorites have maintained their local representation in the respective legislatures. The [[Liberal Party of Canada]] also has a solid electoral history in the city. Canada's 21st Prime Minister, [[Paul Martin]], was born in Windsor. His father, [[Paul Martin Sr.]], a federal [[cabinet minister]] in several portfolios through the Liberal governments of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, was first elected to the House of Commons from a Windsor riding in the 1930s. Martin Sr. practised law in the city and the federal building on Ouellette Avenue is named after him.<ref>{{Cite news |date=29 January 2018 |title=Request for $20M to renovate Paul Martin Building could reintroduce law school option |publisher=[[CBC News]] |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/request-for-20m-to-renovate-paul-martin-building-could-reintroduce-law-school-option-1.4509689 |access-date=22 November 2018 |archive-date=November 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113165917/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/request-for-20m-to-renovate-paul-martin-building-could-reintroduce-law-school-option-1.4509689 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Eugene Whelan]] was a Liberal cabinet minister and one-time Liberal party leadership candidate elected from Essex County from the 1960s to the early 1980s, as well as [[Mark MacGuigan]] of Windsor-Walkerville riding, who also served as External Affairs, and later Justice minister in the early 1980s.

===Current representation===
The current [[List of mayors of Windsor, Ontario|mayor]] of Windsor is [[Drew Dilkens]]. Windsor is governed under the [[Council-Manager]] form of local government and includes the elected [[Windsor City Council|City Council]], mayor, and an appointed Chief Administrative Officer. The city is divided into ten [[ward (country subdivision)|ward]]s, with one councillor representing each ward. The mayor serves as the city's chief executive officer and functions as its ceremonial head. In August 2009, Windsor City Council approved a 10-ward electoral system for the 2010 civic election, with one councillor elected in each ward. Previously, there were two councillors elected in each ward, and there were only five wards.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}} The plan doubled the number of wards, which had been unchanged for 30 years.<ref>{{Cite web |title=By-law to redivide the wards in the City of Windsor |url=http://www.citywindsor.ca/DisplayAttach.asp?AttachID=14802 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927131123/http://www.citywindsor.ca/DisplayAttach.asp?AttachID=14802 |archive-date=September 27, 2011 |access-date=2012-01-02 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Culture and tourism==
[[File:artgallerywindsor.jpg|thumb|right|Art Windsor-Essex gallery overlooking riverfront rock gardens]]
Windsor tourist attractions include the [[Windsor International Film Festival]], [[Caesars Windsor]], a lively downtown club scene, Little Italy, the [[Windsor Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Art Windsor-Essex]] gallery, the [[Odette Sculpture Park]], [[Windsor Light Music Theatre]], [[Adventure Bay Water Park]], and [[Ojibway Park]]. As a border settlement, Windsor was a site of conflict during the [[War of 1812]], a significant entry point into Canada for refugees from slavery via the [[Underground Railroad]] and a significant source of liquor during [[American Prohibition]]. Two sites in Windsor have been designated as [[National Historic Sites of Canada]]: the Sandwich First Baptist Church, a church established by Underground Railroad refugees, and [[François Bâby House]], an important [[War of 1812]] site now serving as [[Windsor's Community Museum]].<ref>{{CRHP|13374|Sandwich First Baptist Church}}</ref><ref>{{CRHP|12401|François Bâby House}}</ref>

The Capitol Theatre in downtown Windsor had been a venue for feature films, plays and other attractions since 1929 until it declared bankruptcy in 2007. The theatre is now used for live orchestral concerts, lectures and dance performances.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Upcoming Events |url=http://www.capitoltheatrewindsor.ca/events/ |access-date=22 November 2018 |publisher=The Capitol Theatre Windsor |archive-date=November 22, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122215814/http://www.capitoltheatrewindsor.ca/events/ |url-status=live }}</ref> [[The Tea Party (band)|The Tea Party]] is a [[progressive rock]] band which has been based in Windsor since its foundation in 1990.

Windsor's nickname is the "Rose City" or the "City of Roses". The Liebeszauber (Love's Magic) rose has been designated as the City of Windsor Rose.<ref>{{Cite web |title='City of Windsor' Rose |url=http://www.helpmefind.com/rose/pl.php?n=57961&tab=1 |access-date=January 2, 2012 |publisher=Helpmefind.com |archive-date=March 15, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315165643/http://www.helpmefind.com/rose/pl.php?n=57961&tab=1 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Windsor is noted for the several large parks and gardens found on its waterfront. The Queen Elizabeth II Sunken Garden is at Jackson Park in the central part of the city. A World War II era [[Avro Lancaster]] was displayed on a stand in the middle of Jackson Park for over four decades but has since been removed for restoration. This park is now home to a mounted [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] replica and a [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]] replica.

Of the parks lining Windsor's waterfront, the largest is the {{convert|5|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} stretch overlooking the Detroit skyline. It extends from the [[Ambassador Bridge]] to the [[Hiram Walker]] Distillery. The western portion of the park contains the [[Windsor Sculpture Park]], which features over 30 large-scale contemporary sculptures for public viewing, along with the Canadian Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The central portion contains Dieppe Gardens, Civic Terrace and Festival Plaza, and the eastern portion is home to the [[Bert Weeks]] Memorial Gardens. Further east along the waterfront is [[Coventry Gardens]], across from Detroit's [[Belle Isle Park|Belle Isle]]. The focal point of this park is the [[Charles Brooks (trade unionist)|Charles Brooks]] Memorial Peace Fountain, which floats in the Detroit River and has a coloured light display at night. The fountain is the largest of its kind in North America and symbolizes the peaceful relationship between Canada and the United States.

[[File:Fireworks DetroitWindsorIntlFreedomFest.jpg|thumb|right|Fireworks at the [[Windsor-Detroit International Freedom Festival]]]]
Each summer, Windsor co-hosts the two-week-long [[Windsor-Detroit International Freedom Festival]], which culminates in a gigantic fireworks display that celebrates [[Canada Day]] and the [[Independence Day (US)|Fourth of July]]. The fireworks display is among the world's largest and takes place on the final Monday in June over the Detroit River between the two downtowns. Each year, the event attracts over a million spectators to both sides of the riverfront. Windsor and Detroit also jointly cohost the annual [[Detroit Windsor International Film Festival]]. At the same time, festivals exclusive to Windsor include the Multicultural Council of Windsor and Essex County Carrousel by the River and Carrousel Around the City, [[Bluesfest International Windsor]] and [[Windsor Pride]].

Following the 2008 [[Red Bull Air Race World Championship]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], Windsor successfully put in a bid to become the first Canadian city to host the event. [[Red Bull]] touted the 2009 race in Windsor as one of the most exciting in the seven-year history of the Red Bull Air Race World Championship,<ref name="redbullairrace1">{{Cite web |title=Red Bull Air Race |url=http://www.redbullairrace.com/cs/Satellite/en_air/Official-Red-Bull-Air-Race-Homepage/001238611393596 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807120228/http://www.redbullairrace.com/cs/Satellite/en_air/Official-Red-Bull-Air-Race-Homepage/001238611393596 |archive-date=August 7, 2009 |access-date=2012-01-02 |publisher=Red Bull Air Race |df=mdy-all}}</ref> and on January 22, 2010, it was announced Windsor would be a host city for the 2010 and 2011 circuits,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Windsor locks in Red Bull air races for two years |url=https://windsorstar.com/entertainment/Bull+Race+returns+Windsor/2472987/story.html |archive-date=January 23, 2010 |access-date=May 7, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123171337/http://www.windsorstar.com/entertainment/Bull+Race+returns+Windsor/2472987/story.html}}</ref> along with a select group of major international cities that includes [[Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth, Australia]] and New York City.

Dubbed the Great Canadian Flag Project, Windsor erected a {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=off|adj=on}} flagpole to fly a 60 feet by {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=off}} by nine metres) Canadian flag in celebration of the [[150th anniversary of Canada]]. Spotlights illuminate the flag at night, with a smaller {{convert|24|by|12|ft|metre|abbr=off}} flag to fly during periods of strong winds. As of January 14, 2017, $300,000 had been raised for the project, including $150,000 from the federal government.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Schmidt |first=Doug |date=14 January 2017 |title=Windsor's biggest flag to help mark Canada's 150th anniversary |work=Windsor Star |url=https://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/windsors-biggest-flag-to-help-mark-canadas-150th-anniversary |access-date=8 February 2017 |archive-date=November 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119074437/https://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/windsors-biggest-flag-to-help-mark-canadas-150th-anniversary |url-status=live }}</ref>

Windsor has often been the place where many metro Detroiters find what is forbidden in the United States. With a minimum [[legal drinking age]] of 21 in Michigan and 19 in Ontario, a significant number of 19 and 20-year-old Americans frequent Windsor's bars. The city also became a gambling attraction with [[Caesars Windsor]]'s opening in 1994, five years before casinos opened in Detroit. One can also purchase [[Cuban cigars]], [[Rum|Cuban rum]], less-costly prescription drugs, [[absinthe]], certain imported foods, and other items not available in the United States. In addition, some same-sex couples from the United States chose to marry in Windsor prior to 2015, when [[same-sex marriage]] was legalized in all 50 U.S. states.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gorman |first=Michele |date=June 26, 2015 |title=Gay Marriage Is Legal in All 50 States: Supreme Court |url=http://www.newsweek.com/supreme-court-gay-marriage-legal-all-50-states-347204 |access-date=23 May 2016 |website=Newsweek |archive-date=May 14, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514005607/http://www.newsweek.com/supreme-court-gay-marriage-legal-all-50-states-347204? |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Media===
[[File:Windsor Star HQ.jpg|thumb|[[Windsor Star]] headquarters]]
{{Main|Media in Windsor, Ontario}}
Windsor and its surrounding area have been served by the ''[[Windsor Star]]'' since 1888. The regional newspaper is the only daily in Windsor and Essex County and has attracted the highest readership per capita in its circulation range of any Canadian metropolitan newspaper.

The ''Windsor Independent'' is an alternative newspaper published once a month. It features reviews, news, politics, arts, culture, and entertainment.

Windsor is considered part of the Detroit television and radio market for territorial rights. Due to this fact and its proximity to [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and [[Cleveland]], radio and television broadcasters in Windsor are accorded a special status by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]], exempting them from many of the [[Canadian content]] ("CanCon") requirements most broadcasters in Canada are required to follow. The CanCon requirements are sometimes blamed in part for the decline in popularity of Windsor radio station [[CKLW]], a 50,000-watt AM radio station that in the late 1960s (prior to the advent of CanCon) had been the top-rated radio station not only in Detroit and Windsor but also in Toledo and Cleveland.

Windsor has also been exempt from [[concentration of media ownership]] rules. Except for [[Blackburn Radio]]-owned stations [[CJWF-FM]] and a rebroadcaster of [[Chatham-Kent|Chatham]]'s [[CKUE-FM]] in Windsor, all other current commercial media outlets are owned by a single company, [[Bell Media]].

The city is home to one [[campus radio]] station, [[CJAM-FM]], situated on the [[University of Windsor]] campus.<ref>{{Cite web |title=CJAM 91.5 Windsor / Detroit Campus Community Radio |url=http://web2.uwindsor.ca/cjam/index2.html |access-date=2012-01-02 |website=Web2.uwindsor.ca |archive-date=September 26, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926211248/http://web2.uwindsor.ca/cjam/index2.html |url-status=live }}</ref>
Windsor is also served by a few informational news websites including windsoriteDOTca News, a local news site; Radio Betna, a Middle Eastern community-based web radio station; and YQG Rocks, which is one of the only media to review entertainment shows since the retirement of [[Windsor Star]] critic Ted Shaw.<ref>{{Cite web |date=May 1, 2015 |title=Ted Shaw's farewell: You get spoiled in this job |url=https://windsorstar.com/arts-2/ted-shaws-farewell-you-get-spoiled-in-this-job |access-date=July 19, 2017 |archive-date=July 29, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729065410/http://windsorstar.com/arts-2/ted-shaws-farewell-you-get-spoiled-in-this-job |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Education==
Windsor youth attend schools in the [[Greater Essex County District School Board]] (prior to 1998, the [[Windsor Board of Education]]), the [[Windsor-Essex Catholic District School Board]], [[Conseil scolaire catholique Providence]] and [[Conseil scolaire Viamonde]]. Independent faith-based schools include Maranatha Christian Academy (JK-12), Canadian Christian Academy (JK-12), [[Académie Ste. Cécile International School]] (JK-12, including [[International Baccalaureate]]), First Lutheran Christian Academy (JK-8), and Windsor Adventist Elementary School. The non-denominational Lakeview Montessori School is a private school as well. The [[Canada South Science City]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Canada South Science City |url=http://www.cssciencecity.com/ |access-date=2012-01-02 |publisher=Cssciencecity.com |archive-date=January 13, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113022204/http://www.cssciencecity.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref> serves the Elementary School Curriculum's Science and Technology component.

Windsor is home to four [[International Baccalaureate]] recognized schools: [[Assumption College School]] (a Catholic high school), Académie Ste. Cécile International School (a private school), [[École secondaire E.J. Lajeunesse]] (a francophone Catholic high school), and [[Riverside Secondary School (Windsor, Ontario)|Riverside Secondary School]] (a public high school). [[Honourable W.C. Kennedy Collegiate|Kennedy Collegiate Institute]] and [[Vincent Massey Secondary School]] are renowned in Southern Ontario for their notable accomplishments nationally in mathematics and computer science. Kennedy was built in 1929 in the central part of the city next to Jackson Park. It is sometimes called the castle because of the unique architecture of its gymnasium at the rear of the school.

===Post-secondary institutions===
The [[University of Windsor]] is Canada's southernmost university. It is a research-oriented, comprehensive university with a student population of 16,000 full-time graduate and undergraduate students. Now entering its most ambitious capital expansion since its founding in 1963, the University of Windsor recently opened the Anthony P. Toldo Health Education & Learning Centre, which houses the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry. With the help of $40 million in Ontario government funding, the university also has recently finished construction of a {{convert|300000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, $112-million Centre for Engineering Innovation; a structure that establishes revolutionary design standards across Canada and beyond. The university is just east of the [[Ambassador Bridge]], south of the Detroit River. 

In Spring 2011, it was announced the University of Windsor would move its music and visual art programs downtown to be housed in the historic Armouries building and former Greyhound Bus Depot at Freedom Way and University Ave E. The move intended to bring an additional 500 students into the downtown core daily. The university also brought its School of Social Work to the old Windsor Star buildings on Ferry and Pitt Streets, bringing an additional 1,000 students into the downtown.

Windsor is also home to [[St. Clair College]] that has a student population of 6,500 full-time students. Its main campus is in Windsor, and it also has campuses in Chatham and Wallaceburg. In 2007, St. Clair College opened a satellite campus in downtown Windsor in the former Cleary International Centre. In April 2010, St. Clair College added to its downtown Windsor presence with the addition of its MediaPlex school. Together, they bring over one thousand students into the downtown core daily. The college also opened the TD Student Centre on the corner of Victoria Avenue and University Avenue in 2012. 

[[File:Cleary StClaircollege Windsor.jpg|thumb|right|St. Clair College campus on Riverside Drive]]

More recently, [[Collège Boréal]] opened an access centre and small campus to their Ouellette Avenue location. This small campus offers access to many Collège Boréal programmes as well as immigration and integration assistance for francophones in the area. Collège Boréal is Windsor's only francophone post-secondary institution, providing service for a small but notable population of [[Franco-Ontarian]]s within the Windsor-Tecumseh-Belle River area.

From 1995 to 2001, the city was home to a satellite campus of the defunct francophone [[Collège des Grands-Lacs]].<ref name="hitech">"New college goes hi-tech." ''[[Windsor Star]]'', August 28, 1995.</ref>

===Public libraries===
The [[Windsor Public Library]] offers education, entertainment, and community history materials, programs, and services. The main branch coordinates a [[literacy]] program for adults who need functional literacy upgrading. The local historical archives are here.

==Health systems==
There are two hospitals in Windsor: [[Hôtel-Dieu Grace Healthcare]], formally Hôtel-Dieu Grace Hospital, and [[Windsor Regional Hospital]]. Hôtel-Dieu Grace Healthcare is the result of an amalgamation of Grace Hospital and Hôtel-Dieu in 1994. The merger occurred due to the [[Government of Ontario]]'s province-wide policy to consolidate resources into [[Local Health Integrated Network]]s, or LHINs. This was to eliminate duplicate services and allocate resources more efficiently across the region. The policy resulted in the closure of many community-based and historically important hospitals across the province. At this time, Hotel-Dieu Hospital does not do surgeries, nor does it have emergency room services. Its focus has moved away from traditional hospital services and provides more supportive healthcare.<ref>{{Cite web |title=HDGH - Programs & Services |url=http://www.hdgh.org/programsservices |access-date=July 19, 2017 |website=Hdgh.org |archive-date=April 17, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417142530/http://hdgh.org/programsservices |url-status=live }}</ref>

Windsor Regional Hospital has formal and informal agreements with Detroit-area hospitals. For instance, [[pediatric]] [[neurosurgery]] is no longer performed in Windsor. Leamington District Memorial Hospital in [[Leamington, Ontario]] serves much of [[Essex County, Ontario|Essex County]] and, along with the Windsor institutions, shares resources with the [[Chatham-Kent]] Health Alliance.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Over eighteen thousand Windsor residents are employed in the health care profession.<ref>{{Cite web |publisher=Government of Canada, Statistics Canada |title=Census Profile, 2016 Census - Windsor [Census metropolitan area], Ontario and Saskatchewan [Province] |url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CMACA&Code1=559&Geo2=PR&Code2=47&Data=Count&SearchText=Windsor&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All |access-date=2018-04-13 |website=12.statcan.gc.ca |date=February 8, 2017 |archive-date=April 17, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210417214220/https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CMACA&Code1=559&Geo2=PR&Code2=47&Data=Count&SearchText=Windsor&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{Main|E.C. Row Expressway}}
Windsor has a municipal highway, E.C. Row Expressway, running east–west through the city. Consisting of {{convert|15.7|km|mi|abbr=on}} of highway and nine interchanges, the expressway is the fastest way for commuters to travel across the city. E.C. Row Expressway is mentioned in the Guinness Book of Records as the shortest freeway, which took the longest time to build, as it took more than 15 years to complete.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Relocating to Windsor|url=https://www.windsoronthouses.com/relocating-to-windsor|access-date=2022-02-02|website=Windsoronthouses.com|archive-date=February 2, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220202230322/https://www.windsoronthouses.com/relocating-to-windsor|url-status=live}}</ref> The expressway stretches from Windsor's far west end at [[Ojibway Parkway]] east to Banwell Road on the city's border with Tecumseh.
[[File:Windsor Station (31751837992).jpg|thumb|Via Rail train at [[Windsor station (Ontario)|Windsor station]]]]
The majority of development in the city of Windsor and the neighbouring town of Tecumseh stretches along the water instead of inland. As a result, there is a lack of major east–west arteries compared to north–south arteries. Only [[Riverside Drive (Windsor, Ontario)|Riverside Drive]], Wyandotte Street, [[Tecumseh Road]], County Road 42/Cabana Road and the E.C. Row Expressway serve the almost {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the west end of Windsor eastward. All of these roads, especially the E.C. Row Expressway, are burdened with east–west commuter traffic from the development in the city's east end and suburbs further east.
There are eight north–south roads interchanging with the expressway: [[Huron Church Road]], Dominion Boulevard, Dougall Avenue, [[Howard Avenue (Windsor, Ontario)|Howard Avenue]], [[Walker Road]], Central Avenue, Jefferson Boulevard, and Lauzon Parkway. Traffic backups on some of these north–south roads at the E.C. Row Expressway are common, mainly at Dominion, Dougall, Howard, and Walker as the land south of the expressway and east of Walker is occupied by Windsor airport and there has been little development.

Windsor's many rail crossings intersect with these north–south thoroughfares. In October 2008, the Province of Ontario completed a grade separation at Walker Road and the CP Rail line. Another grade separation was completed in November 2010 at Howard Avenue and the CP Rail line. In both cases, the road travels under the rail line, and both have below-grade intersections with an east–west street. These were planned as parts of the "Let's Get Windsor-Essex Moving" project funded by the Province of Ontario to improve local transportation infrastructure.

Windsor is connected to [[Essex, Ontario|Essex]] and [[Leamington, Ontario|Leamington]] via [[Ontario Highway 3|Highway 3]] and is well connected to the other municipalities and communities throughout Essex County via the [[county road]] [[List of roads in Essex County, Ontario|network]]. Nearly 20,000 vehicles travel on Highway 3 in Essex County daily. It is the main route to work for many Leamington, Kingsville and Essex residents.

Windsor is linked to the United States by the [[Ambassador Bridge]], the [[Detroit–Windsor Tunnel]], a [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] [[Michigan Central Railway Tunnel|tunnel]], and the [[Detroit–Windsor Truck Ferry]]. In terms of goods volume, the Ambassador Bridge is North America's No. 1 international border crossing: 27% of all trade between Canada and the United States crosses at the Ambassador Bridge.

Windsor has a [[bike trail]] network including the ([[Riverfront Bike Trail]], [[Ganatchio Bike Trail]], and [[Little River Extension]]). They have become a blend of parkland and transportation, as people use the trails to commute to work or across downtown on their bicycles.

===Airports===
The city is served by [[Windsor International Airport]], a regional airport with scheduled commuter air service by [[Air Canada Express]], [[Porter Airlines]], [[WestJet]], and [[Sunwing Airlines|Sunwing]], along with heavy [[general aviation]] traffic. The majority of destinations are within Ontario except seasonal routes to [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]] and a variety of [[Caribbean]] destinations.

The [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport]] is approximately {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} across the border in [[Romulus, Michigan]] and is the airport of choice for many Windsor residents as it has regular flights to a larger variety of destinations than Windsor Airport.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2006-02-09 |title=aircanada.com |url=http://www.aircanada.ca/ |access-date=2012-01-02 |publisher=Aircanada.ca |archive-date=June 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622230513/http://www.aircanada.ca/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Shuttle buses and cars are within driving distance to larger airports like [[London International Airport]], [[John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport]] and to Canada's busiest airport and international hub [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]].

===Waterways===
The Port of Windsor, which covers {{convert|21.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} of shoreline along the Detroit River, is part of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway|Great Lakes/Saint Lawrence Seaway]] System. Accessible to both [[Lake freighter]]s and ocean-going vessels, the port is the third largest Canadian Great Lakes port in terms of shipments behind only [[Hamilton-Oshawa Port Authority|Hamilton]] and [[Thunder Bay Port Authority|Thunder Bay]]. Cargos include a wide range of products such as aggregates, salt, grain, fluorspar, lumber, steel, petroleum, vehicles and heavy lift equipment.<ref>{{Cite web|title=About The Port|url=http://www.portwindsor.com/ecom.asp?pg=about |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402172055/http://www.portwindsor.com/ecom.asp?pg=about |archive-date=April 2, 2012 |access-date=November 19, 2012 |website=Portwindsor.com |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Mass transit===
====Road====
{{Main|Transit Windsor}}
[[File:Transit Windsor 629.JPG|thumb|right|Transit Windsor hybrid 'XCelsior' bus]]
A [[public transport bus service]] is provided by [[Transit Windsor]], the city-owned bus company, operating 15 fixed bus routes with a fleet of 114 vehicles through the city as well as providing transportation for many of the city's secondary school students and a service to downtown Detroit. [[Transit Windsor]] shares its newly constructed $8 million downtown [[Windsor International Transit Terminal|Transit Terminal]] with [[Greyhound Lines]]. The new depot opened in 2007. Current bus fare is $3.25 for all riders except for children under 12 ride for free on regular service routes. Attending students are charged $10.00 to and from Canada and the United States, both [[United States Dollar|American]] and [[Canadian dollar|Canadian]] currencies are accepted on the tunnel bus.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Transit Windsor |url=http://www.citywindsor.ca/residents/transitwindsor/Fares/Pages/Fares.aspx |access-date=17 February 2014 |archive-date=June 9, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609022740/http://www.citywindsor.ca/residents/transitwindsor/Fares/Pages/Fares.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Rail====
{{Main|Quebec City–Windsor Corridor#Rail}}
Windsor has a long history with rail travel in both passenger service and freight due to the [[Michigan Central Railway Tunnel]]. [[Inter-city rail|Intercity]] [[passenger railway]] service is provided by [[Via Rail]] throughout the region via the [[Windsor railway station (Ontario)|Windsor Railway Station]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=October 29, 2014 |title=List of stations - Canada |url=http://www.viarail.ca/en/explore-our-destinations/stations/list |access-date=July 19, 2017 |website=VIA Rail |archive-date=July 26, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170726073951/http://www.viarail.ca/en/explore-our-destinations/stations/list |url-status=live }}</ref> The region also used to have a second station, the [[Windsor Michigan Central Railroad Depot]] {{ndash}} before it was destroyed in a fire {{ndash}} which historically served the [[Canada Southern Railway]], [[New York Central Railroad]] and [[Amtrak]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Bridges to Detroit===
{{Main|Ambassador Bridge|Gordie Howe International Bridge}}
A major and controversial issue is the amount of traffic to and from the Ambassador Bridge. The number of vehicles crossing the bridge has doubled since 1990. However, the total volume of traffic has been declining since the [[September 11 attacks]].

Access to the Ambassador Bridge is via two municipal roads: [[Huron Church Road]] and [[Wyandotte Street]]. A large portion of the traffic consists of tractor-trailers. There have been, at times, a wall of trucks up to {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} long on [[Huron Church Road]]. This road cuts through the city's west end, and the trucks are the source of many complaints about noise, pollution and pedestrian hazards. In 2003, a single mother of three, Jacqueline Bouchard, was struck and killed by a truck at the corner of Huron Church and Girardot Avenue in front of [[Assumption College School|Assumption College Catholic High School]], a tragedy argued to be due to a lack of practical safety precautions.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Suit settled in death that led to overpass|url=http://www.gregmonforton.com/news/overpass.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304062617/http://www.gregmonforton.com/news/overpass.pdf |archive-date=March 4, 2012 |access-date=2012-01-02 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Windsor City Council hired traffic consultant [[Sam Schwartz]] to produce a proposal for a solution to this traffic problem. City councillors overwhelmingly endorsed the proposal and it was presented to the federal government as a "Made in Windsor" solution. Not all of the surrounding residents supported the plan. One problem with the plan is the proposed road would cut through protected green spaces such as the Ojibway Prairie Reserve.

In 2005, the Detroit River International Crossing (DRIC&nbsp;— a joint Canadian-American committee studying the options for expanding the border crossing) announced its preferred option was to extend [[Highway 401]] directly westward to a new bridge spanning the Detroit River and interchange with [[Interstate 75]] somewhere between the existing Ambassador Bridge span and [[Wyandotte, Michigan|Wyandotte]].

On April 9, 2010, the City of Windsor, along with local cabinet ministers Dwight Duncan and Sandra Pupatello of the Province of Ontario, announced a final decision had been made in the plans to construct the Windsor-Essex Parkway, the new Highway 401 extension leading to a future crossing. The announcement indicated the project would be the most expensive road ever built in Canada on a per kilometre basis. It included commitments to enhance green space design through the use of berming, landscaping, and other aesthetic treatments. As part of negotiations with the City of Windsor (who threatened legal action in pursuit of more tunnelling and green space of the route), the province agreed to additional funding to infrastructure projects in Windsor-Essex; this includes money for the improvement of the plaza of the Canadian side of the Windsor-Detroit tunnel, the widening and other improvements of Walker Rd between Division Rd and E.C. Row Expressway, and the environmental assessment and preliminary design of a future extension of Lauzon Parkway to Highway 401.
