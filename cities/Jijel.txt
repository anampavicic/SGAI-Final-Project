==History==
{{main|Igilgili}}
Originally Phoenician, [[Igilgili]] passed to the [[Carthaginian Empire|Carthaginians]], the [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire|Empire]], the [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandals]], the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], the [[Republic of Genoa|Genovese]], and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. It was conquered for the last time in the 16th century by [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]].

In July 1664, the [[Djidjelli expedition|French took the city]]. Resistance was organised under the direction of [[Shaban Aga]] and the French were driven out in October of the same year. Jijel remained a [[Barbary corsairs|corsair]] stronghold until recaptured by the French in 1839. Strong local resistance, finally subdued in 1851, resulted in the construction of three forts along its southern fringe as well as minimal colonisation. The original town was devastated by an earthquake in 1856.

==Communications==
Due to the rugged landscape, Jijel is slightly isolated. However, it is connected by road to large cities like [[Bejaïa]] (90&nbsp;km west), [[Setif]] (135&nbsp;km southwest) and [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] (150&nbsp;km southeast). The city also has its own airport [[Jijel Ferhat Abbas Airport]].

==Infrastructure==
Jijel is built along modern patterns with wide streets framed by trees. The surroundings consist largely of dense cork-oak forest. A [[peninsula]] lies right out from the coast and there is a [[citadel]] to the north. There is a hospital, previously a Catholic church (which was demolished), mosques and [[University of Jijel]].

==Port==
A relatively new port has been built at [[Djen Djen]],<ref name="port">Enterprise Portuaire de Djen Djen. 2009</ref> approximately 7 miles east of Jijel, which can handle large bulk carriers having a draft up to 18.2m. Presently, the port is mainly used by car carriers and break bulk vessels.
