'''Louga''' ({{langx|ar|لوجا}}; [[Wolof language|Wolof]]: Luga) is a city in northwestern [[Senegal]].  Louga is a cattle market centre, and has road and rail links with the port city of [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]] to the northwest and [[Dakar]] to the southwest.  The area surrounding Louga is at the northern limits of Senegal's peanut- (groundnut-) growing area and is inhabited by the [[Fulani]], who are generally pastoral nomads, and the [[Wolof people|Wolof]], who are sedentary farmers. Louga is located in what is called the Ndiambour, which used to be part of the [[Cayor]] province.

In 2013, according to official figures from the {{ill|National Agency for Statistics and Demography (Senegal)|lt=National Agency for Statistics and Demography|fr|Agence nationale de la statistique et de la démographie}} (ANSD), Louga had a population of 104,000 inhabitants.

== Administration ==
Louga is both the capital of the [[Louga Department|Louga department]] and of the [[Louga Region|Louga region]].

The administrative region of Louga was formed in 1976, divided into 3 departments with 11 districts and 48 communities. There are 7 municipalities.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Louga|url=https://senegal2019.org/gouvernance-locale/louga/|access-date=2020-07-16|website=Sénégal2019|date=16 January 2019 |language=fr-FR}}</ref>
[[File:Map of the departments of the Louga region of Senegal.png|alt=A map showcasing the3 departments of the Louga region: Louga, Kebemer, and Linguere.|thumb|The 3 departments of the Louga region]]

The Louga region is made up of 3 departments:

* Louga
* Kebemer
* Linguere

== Geography ==

The climate is dry, almost desertlike, with a long dry season called the [[harmattan]] that can last 9 months or more. This season carries dust to Louga and occasionally causes [[dust storm|sandstorms]], promoting wind erosion and water loss by evaporation.

=== Population ===
The main ethnic groups are the [[Wolof people|Wolof]], the [[Fula people|Fula]], the [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleur]], and the Moors.

=== Economy ===
[[File:LougaBoulangerie.jpg|none|thumb|A bread shop in Louga]]

== Climate ==
Louga, with year-round hot weather, has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''BWh''). Louga has a mildly rainy wet season from July to October, while the period from November to May has very little precipitation.
