It is the capital of the [[Emirate of Sharjah]] and forms part of the [[Dubai-Sharjah-Ajman metropolitan area]].

Sharjah is the capital of the [[emirate of Sharjah|eponymous emirate]]. The emirate shares [[law|legal]], political, military and economic functions with the other emirates of the UAE within a [[Federal government of the United Arab Emirates|federal]] framework, although each emirate has jurisdiction over some functions such as civil law enforcement and provision and upkeep of local facilities. Sharjah has been ruled by the [[Al Qasimi]] dynasty since the 18th century.

The city is a center for culture and industry, and alone contributes 7.4% of the GDP of the [[United Arab Emirates]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thisissharjah.com/blog/about-sharjah/ |title=About Sharjah |work=This Is Sharjah |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315092152/http://www.thisissharjah.com/blog/about-sharjah/ |archive-date=15 March 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The city covers an approximate area of 235&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and has a population of over 1,800,000 (2022–2023).<ref name="sharjah-census-2022"/> The sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages is prohibited in the emirate of Sharjah without possession of an alcohol license and alcohol is not served in hotels, restaurants or other outlets in Sharjah, due to the Muslim majority in the area.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name of Sharjah is unknown, with most common interpretations linking the origin of the word Sharjah to the word ''sharq'' ({{langx|ar|شَرْق|lit=east}}) due to the fact that the city is located to the east of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and that Sharjah was the easternmost settlement at the time.<ref>{{Cite web |date=11 October 2005 |title=علي المطروشي: هذه هي الحقيقة في أصول مسميات الإمارات |url=https://www.albayan.ae/sports/2005-10-11-1.983993 |access-date=5 June 2023 |website=Al-Bayan |language=ar |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225030757/https://www.albayan.ae/sports/2005-10-11-1.983993 |archive-date=25 February 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

However, other interpretations have disputed the origin of the name based on location, and suggested instead that it refers to the word ''shurūq'' ({{langx|ar|شُروق|lit=sunrise}}). Further theories have linked the name to a pre-Islamic idol called ''Abed Al Shareq'' that transformed into ''Sharjah''. The origin of the word has also been linked to the [[Andalusi Arabic]] usage of the word, which was used to refer to a fort.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Obaid |first=Ahmed |date=16 September 2007 |title=معاني أسماء الإمارات |url=https://www.albayan.ae/sports/2007-09-16-1.790246 |access-date=5 June 2023 |website=Al-Bayan |language=ar |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230605102604/https://www.albayan.ae/sports/2007-09-16-1.790246 |archive-date=5 June 2023 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Sharjah Heritage.jpg|thumb|An old door in Sharjah, displaying the historical architecture of the city.]]

Sharjah was historically one of the wealthiest towns in this region with a settlement in existence for over 5000 years.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fCZWUbZQruoC&pg=PA136|title=The Report: Sharjah 2008|publisher=Oxford Business Group|year=2008|page=136|isbn=9781902339023|access-date=10 January 2019|archive-date=20 February 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230220135243/https://books.google.com/books?id=fCZWUbZQruoC&pg=PA136|url-status=live}}</ref> In the early 18th century, the Huwayla tribe of the [[Al Qasimi|Qawasim]] clan established itself in Sharjah {{c.}} 1727, declaring Sharjah independent. On 8 January 1820, Sheikh [[Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi|Sultan I]] signed the [[General Maritime Treaty of 1820|General Maritime Treaty]] with Britain, accepting a protectorate to keep the [[Ottoman Turks]] out. Like its neighbors [[Ajman]], [[Dubai]], [[Ras al-Khaimah|Ras Al Khaimah]], and [[Umm Al Quwain]], Sharjah's position on the route to India made it important enough to be recognized as a [[salute state]] (be it of the lowest class: 3 guns).

In 1829, English author and traveler [[James Silk Buckingham]] described Sharjah as such:
{{blockquote|
"In the course of the night, we had passed the port of Sharjee, on the Arabian coast, which is not an island, [[Carsten Niebuhr|Niebuhr]]'s chart, the only one in which it is inserted; but a small town, on a sandy beach, containing from five to six hundred inhabitants. It is situated in lat. 25° 34' north, and lies eleven leagues south-west of a small island, close to the shore, called [[Al Jazirah Al Hamra|Jeziret-el-Hamra]]; and three leagues south-west of Sharjee is Aboo Hayle."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023909213.0x00009e|title='Travels in Assyria, Media, and Persia, [...]' [476] (507/582)|publisher=Qatar Digital Library|author=James Silk Buckingham|year=1829|access-date=10 January 2019|archive-date=11 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111054853/https://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023909213.0x00009e|url-status=live}} ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''</ref>
}}

With the approach of the 20th century, Sharjah extended inland to the area now known as Wasit Suburb, the area between the city and Al Dhaid being under the control of the tribes of the interior. With a population of 15,000 inhabitants, Sharjah had some four or five shops in [[Layyah, Sharjah|Layyah]] and a bazaar of around 200 shops in main Sharjah.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf Vol II|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|pages=1762}}</ref>

In the midst of [[World War II]], [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|Nazi propaganda]] infiltrated the town. Loud propagating of pro-[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] speeches could be heard emanating from the Sheikh of Sharjah's palace during a period in 1940, and messages sharing a similar sentiment graffitied on walls in the town center according to [[British Empire|British]] intelligence reports at the time, for the messages being propagated by the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] was one of [[anti-imperialism]], it found a sympathetic audience among some of the emirate's populace, particularly Abdullah bin Faris, a secretary of the Sheikh who was responsible for the broadcasts. After the Sheikh was confronted by the British, he wrote a letter reaffirming his support for the British war efforts and disputed the charges laid out against bin Faris. Attached to the letter was a petition signed by 48 prominent individuals testifying to bin Faris' character, which, according to the British, had been misrepresented to the signees. The incident resolved after the Sheikh and bin Faris ceased transmitting propaganda and doubled down on their support to the British.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.qdl.qa/en/nazi-propaganda-sharjah-during-world-war-ii|title=Nazi Propaganda in Sharjah during World War II|author=Louis Allday|date=18 December 2014|publisher=Qatar Digital Library|access-date=10 January 2019|archive-date=10 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110235001/https://www.qdl.qa/en/nazi-propaganda-sharjah-during-world-war-ii|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 2 December 1971, Sharjah, together with [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Dubai]], [[Ajman]], [[Umm Al Qawain]], and [[Fujairah]] joined in the Act of Union to form the [[United Arab Emirates]]. The seventh emirate, [[Ras al-Khaimah]], joined the UAE on 10 February 1972 following [[Iran]]'s annexation of Ras al-Khaimah's [[Tunbs]] islands.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

Like the other former [[Trucial States]], Sharjah's name is known by many [[Stamp collecting|stamp collectors]] because of the large numbers of stamps that were issued by the [[Postage stamps and postal history of Sharjah|Sharjah Post Office]] shortly before the formation of the United Arab Emirates. These stamps that were printed in profusion became worthless to collectors and came to be known as [[Dunes (Stamps)|Dunes]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ohmygosh.on.ca/stamps/sharjah/sharjah.htm |title=Sharjah & Dependencies Stamps and Postal Stationery Site |publisher=Ohmygosh.on.ca |access-date=18 November 2012 |archive-date=13 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513160057/http://www.ohmygosh.on.ca/stamps/sharjah/sharjah.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> Many of the items featured on these stamps were  unrelated to the emirate and therefore many catalogues do not list them.<ref>Carlton, R.

Five times a day, Muslims are called to prayer from the [[minaret]]s of mosques, which are spread across the country.
