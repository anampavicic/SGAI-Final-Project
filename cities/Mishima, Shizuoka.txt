== History ==
Mishima is an ancient town, which developed around the important [[Shinto shrine]] of {{nihongo|[[Mishima Taisha|Mishima Shrine]]|三嶋大社|Mishima Taisha}}. Under the ''[[Ritsuryō]]'' administration system established in the [[Nara period]], Mishima was made capital of [[Izu Province]]. It was also the location of the [[Provincial temple|''Kokubun-ji'']] for Izu Province. In the [[Edo period]], Mishima prospered from its location on the [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō]] highway connecting [[Edo]] with [[Kyoto]], and [[Mishima-shuku]] was one of the 53 [[shukuba|post stations]] on that road. The area was ''[[tenryō]]'' territory ruled by a ''[[daikan]]'' appointed directly by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. After the [[Meiji Restoration]], Mishima became part of the short-lived Nirayama Prefecture in 1868. This merged with the equally short-lived Ashigara Prefecture in 1871, and became part of Shizuoka Prefecture from 18 April 1876. With the establishment of the modern municipalities system of 1889, the area was reorganized as Mishima Town within Kimisawa District. In 1892, [[Prince Komatsu Akihito]] established a villa in Mishima. Its gardens, the ''Rakujūen'', are a noted visitor attraction in Mishima to this day. In 1896, Kimisawa District became part of [[Tagata District, Shizuoka]]. Mishima received its first train connection in 1898 when the predecessor of the [[Izuhakone Railway]] established what is now [[Shimo-Togari Station]]. The [[Sunzu Line]] began operations from 1906. However, Mishima's fortunes revived strongly only after the [[Tanna Tunnel]] was completed in 1934, connecting the town to the [[Tōkaidō Main Line]] railway between Tokyo and [[Shizuoka, Shizuoka|Shizuoka]]. Mishima developed rapidly afterwards, merging with neighboring Kitakami Village in 1935 and Watada Village in 1941. Mishima Town was elevated in status to a city on 29 April 1941. It became a stop on the [[Tōkaidō Shinkansen]] from 1969, leading to an expansion in population, as the line made it possible to [[commuting|commute]] to Tokyo.

==Government==
Mishima has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city legislature of 22 members. The city contributes two members to the Shizuoka Prefectural Assembly.

==Economy==
Mishima is a major industrial center within Shizuoka Prefecture. In addition to a railroad repair facility operated by [[Central Japan Railway Company|JR Central]], the city hosts factories from:
* [[Toray]]
* DMW Corporation
* Toshiba TEC Corporation
* [[Yokohama Rubber Company]]
* CFS Corporation (HAC Drugstores)
* [[Izuhakone Railway]] Company Ltd

==Education==
Mishima has 14 public elementary schools, and seven public middle schools operated by the city government and three public high schools operated by the Shizuoka Prefectural Board of Education. There are one private junior high school and two private high schools. In addition, [[Juntendo University]] and the [[Graduate University for Advanced Studies]] each have a facility at Mishima. The College of [[International Relations]] for [[Nihon University]] is located in Mishima. A former private junior college, [[Fujimigaoka Women's Junior College]], was operating between 1966 and 2009.
