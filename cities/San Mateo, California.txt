===Spanish era===
In 1789, the Spanish missionaries had named a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] village along Laurel Creek as ''Los Laureles'' or the Laurels ([[Mission San Mateo|Mission Dolores]], 1789). At the time of [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexican Independence]], 30 native Californians were at San Mateo, most likely from the Salson tribelet.<ref name="SMCH">{{cite book|last1=Postel|first1=Mitchell P.|title=San Mateo: A Centennial History|date=1994|publisher=Scottwall Associates, Publishers|isbn=978-0-942087-08-6|edition=1st|location=San Francisco, Calif.|page=13}}</ref>

=== Mexican era ===
[[File:Diseño_of_Rancho_San_Mateo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Much of the area was granted to [[Californio]] ranchero Cayetano Arenas in 1846 as [[Rancho San Mateo]].]]
Captain [[Frederick William Beechey]] in 1827 traveling with the hills on their right, known in that part as the Sierra del Sur, began to approach the road, which passing over a small eminence, opened out upon "a wide country of meadow land, with clusters of fine oak free from underwood... It strongly resembled a nobleman's park: herds of cattle and horses were grazing upon the rich pasture, and numerous fallow‑deer, startled at the approach of strangers, bounded off to seek protection among the hills... This spot is named San Matheo, and belongs to the mission of San Francisco."<ref name="SMCH" />

The city of San Mateo was documented by Spanish colonists as part of the [[Rancho de las Pulgas]] (literally "Ranch of the Fleas") and the [[Rancho San Mateo]]; the earliest history is held in the archives of [[Mission Dolores]]. Rancho San Mateo was granted in May 1846 from [[Pío Pico]] to his secretary, Cayetano Arenas; this tract included approximately half of present-day San Mateo, all of Burlingame and Hillsborough, and the Spring Valley lakes (now [[Crystal Springs Reservoir]] and [[San Andreas Lake]]).<ref name=Alexander-16/>{{rp|32}} [[William Davis Merry Howard]] purchased Rancho San Mateo from Arenas<ref name=Stanger-63>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/southfromsanfran00stan_0/ |title=South from San Francisco: San Mateo County, California, its history and heritage |chapter=VI.

In the November 2022 election, Councilmember [[Diane Papan]] was elected to the [[California State Assembly]], creating a vacancy on the 5-person city council. At the December 5, 2022, council reorganization meeting, two of the remaining four councilmembers chose not to follow the standard precedent of selecting a new mayor, which normally rotates to the councilmember who has been in office the longest. With the vote split at 2–2, the city went a week without a mayor. After a second meeting that also ended without a decision, Amourence Lee was selected as the mayor at the third meeting on December 12.<ref>{{cite web

==Geography==
[[File:Zeppelin-ride-020100925-130 (5028699547).jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of [[Coyote Point Park]], directed northeast towards [[San Francisco Bay]] and the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]].]]
San Mateo is located at {{Coord|37|33|15|N|122|18|47|W|type:city}} (37.554286, −122.313044).<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|15.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|12.1|sqmi|km2}} are land and {{convert|3.8|sqmi|km2}}, comprising 23.63%, are covered by water.

The best-known natural area is [[Coyote Point Park]], a rock outcropped peninsula that juts out into the [[San Francisco Bay]]. The early Spanish navigators named it ''la punta de San Mateo.''<ref>Brown, 1975</ref> Crews of American cargo ships carrying grain in the bay renamed it ''Big Coyote''.<ref>(BLM, 1853).</ref> Sailors had a penchant for naming promontories at the edge of San Francisco Bay after the [[coyote]]; across the bay in Fremont are the Coyote Hills, part of [[Coyote Hills Regional Park]]. By the 1890s, the shore area was developed as a popular beach called San Mateo Beach. In 1842, the Spanish had named it ''playa de San Mateo''. Today, Coyote Point is home to [[CuriOdyssey]], formerly known as the Coyote Point Museum, a major [[natural history]] museum and wildlife center in the state. The animal care facility for the [[Peninsula Humane Society]] is also situated at Coyote Point, where the adoption facility is located in Burlingame, CA.
[[File:Parkside Aquatic Park, San Mateo - 51792634076.jpg|thumb|right|Parkside Aquatic Park on [[Seal Slough|Marina Lagoon]].]]
The variety of natural habitats includes mixed [[oak]] woodland, [[riparian]] zones, and bayland marshes. One [[endangered species]], the [[California clapper rail]], was sighted feeding on mudflats by the Third Avenue bridge in San Mateo.<ref>Pfeifle, 1980</ref>  The marsh areas are also likely habitat for the endangered [[salt marsh harvest mouse]], which inhabits the middle and high zones of salt and [[brackish]] [[marsh]]es, as well as for the endangered marsh plant, [[Point Reyes bird's beak]].

Sugarloaf Mountain, whose name has been documented in 1870, is a prominent landform between the forks of Laurel Creek.<ref>(Brown, 1975)</ref> In the late 20th century, this mixed oak woodland and chaparral habitat was a site of controversy related to proposals to develop a portion of the mountain for residential use. It has been preserved for use as park and open space area, and is home to the endangered [[mission blue butterfly]].

[[Sawyer Camp Trail]], located on the western edge of San Mateo along the [[Crystal Springs Reservoir]], is another popular destination for joggers, pedestrians, and bikers. This roughly {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=on}} trail begins in San Mateo and stretches north toward Hillsborough and San Bruno, parallel to the 280 freeway.

===Neighborhoods===
[[File:Downtown San Mateo (263918695) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|"Main Street" alley in downtown.]]
In general, San Mateo's downtown core and the neighborhoods east of [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] are more populous and have a greater density than the neighborhoods to the west of El Camino Real, where there is a lower population density.

;Downtown
San Mateo has one of the larger, better-developed suburban downtowns in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. It is located roughly between Tilton Ave. to the northwest, 9th Ave. to the southeast, Delaware St. to the northeast and [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] to the southwest. The downtown core contains over 800 shops and restaurants, many located in historic buildings from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The non-profit Downtown San Mateo Association (DSMA) works on behalf of downtown businesses to promote them and improve the downtown area.<ref>{{cite web|title=Downtown San Mateo Association|url=https://www.smccvb.com/listing/downtown-san-mateo-association/2937/|access-date=December 4, 2021|website=Smccvb.com|language=en-us}}</ref>

[[Central Park (San Mateo)|Central Park]] is considered to be San Mateo's signature park with a baseball field, tennis courts, sculptures, picnic areas, playground, Japanese tea garden, recreation center, miniature train, rose garden and the [[San Mateo Arboretum]]. The {{convert|16.3|acre|ha|adj=on}} property was purchased by the city in 1922.<ref>{{cite web|title=Central Park and Japanese Garden {{!}} San Mateo, CA - Official Website|url=https://www.cityofsanmateo.org/3319/Central-Park-Japanese-Garden|access-date=December 4, 2021|website=Cityofsanmateo.org}}</ref> A historically influential area for the Japanese-American community, the downtown is home to many Japanese restaurants and shops. A large, 12-screen movie theater complex is located off the Main Street alley between 2nd and 3rd Ave. The [[San Mateo Caltrain station]] is situated downtown. The area also contains many large and small multi-story office buildings, apartments, government buildings and Mills Medical Center.

The city aims to conduct the project in two phases: First, by installing retractable bollards and updating traffic signals and signage, then by raising the level of the street to be flush with sidewalk and reimagining its landscaping.

San Mateo has a [[Mediterranean]] [[climate]] with warm, dry summers and mild, damp winters. The city is generally shielded from the [[Pacific Ocean]] by the [[Montara Mountain]] block of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]], but two gaps in the mountains (the San Bruno Gap, between Montara Mountain and [[San Bruno Mountain]]; and the [[Crystal Springs Reservoir|Crystal Springs]] Gap, near where [[State Route 92 (California)|State Route 92]] meets [[State Route 35 (California)|State Route 35]], west of the [[College of San Mateo]]) can channel ocean weather, resulting in gusty afternoon winds that bring fog toward San Mateo in the late afternoon through early morning in the summer.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wb1cks8Qe4IC&pg=PA40 |title=Weather of the San Francisco Bay Region |author=Gilliam, Harold |edition=2nd |date=2002 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=978-0-520-22989-1 |pages=40–43 |chapter=The Four Seasons: Summer |access-date=March 23, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baaqmd.gov/Divisions/Communications-and-Outreach/Air-Quality-in-the-Bay-Area/Bay-Area-Climatology/Subregions/Peninsula.aspx |title=Bay Area Climatology: Peninsula Subregion |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=October 4, 2010 |website=Bay Area Air Quality Management District |access-date=March 23, 2015 }}</ref>
