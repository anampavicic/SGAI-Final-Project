In 1787 AD, Nawab Ali Bahudur I with the help of Kalinjar Bhatts defeated the Bundelas and captured Bhuragarh.<ref name="AMAR UJALA">{{cite news |last1=मिश्रा |first1=प्रभापुंज |title=800 शहीद और 300 क्रांतिकारियों को हुई थी फांसी |url=https://www.amarujala.com/uttar-pradesh/banda/800-martyrs-and-300-revolutionaries-were-hanged |access-date=30 April 2022 |work=Amar Ujala |date=18 April 2019 |language=hi}}</ref> He started a series of wars and extended his dominions from Kalpi to Kalinjar.<ref name="govind sakharam">{{cite book |last1=Marathas |title=The new history of Marathas |publisher=Phoenix Publications |pages=156–169 |url=https://indianculture.gov.in/ebooks/new-history-marathas-vol-3 |ref=sakharam}}</ref> He is called the Conqueror of Bundelkhand and his forces swayed into Orchcha and levied chauth for Peshwas of Pune. His thrust enabled Kalinjar Bhattas to march into Vindhya and defeat Rewa, Maihar, Vijayraghogargh and adjoining states.

He established a modern education system and helped to renew the Banda administrations.

This was the golden period of Banda when culture and language were promoted. Nawab Tank was built in memory of Mirza Ghalib, who happens to be a blood relative of Nawab. Nawab started the Shazar stone masonry works and his rule was one of the milestones in peace and Maratha hegemony.

The Indian Rebellion of 1857 started on 14 June. In Banda it was led by Nawab [[Ali Bahadur II]]. This struggle was much fiercer than expected and revolutionaries from Allahabad, Kanpur and Bihar joined the Nawab in fighting the British. On 15 June 1857, revolutionaries killed Joint Magistrate Cockrail. On 16 April 1858, Whitluck arrived in Banda and fought against the Maratha army of Banda, supported by Tatya on south and Kalinjar Bhatts from east. About 3000 revolutionaries were killed in the fort during this war. Nuts (people who perform acrobatic feats) from Sarbai sacrificed their lives in this war. Their graves are found inside the fort.

The Nawab was dismissed from his possessions in Banda, imprisoned and sent to Indore jail. All his Banda dominions were passed to RaiBahadur Manvendrasingh Awasthi, an important minister of Kalinjar bhattshahi.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}
