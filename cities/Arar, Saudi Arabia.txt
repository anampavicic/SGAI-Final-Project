'''Arar''' ({{langx|ar|عرعر}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿArʿar}}''&nbsp; {{IPA|ar|ˈʕarʕar|}} [[Literal translation|lit.]]: "[[Juniper]]") is the capital of [[Northern Borders Province]] in [[Saudi Arabia]]. It has a population of 202,719 (2022 census).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Northern Borders Region (Saudi Arabia): Places in Governorates - Population Statistics, Charts and Map |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/saudiarabia/northern/ |access-date=2024-02-05 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref>

Arar is located in northern Saudi Arabia near the Iraqi [[Iraq–Saudi Arabia border|border]]. It is known for its fertile [[pasture]] lands{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} which lends itself well to its principal occupation of sheep and camel herding.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The population of the entire Northern Borders Province, including the cities of [[Rafha]], [[Turaif]] and Alaoiqilah and suburban villages and their inhabitants, was 373,577 at the 2022 census. Arar serves as a significant supply stop for travelers on the [[Saudi Arabian highway 85]].

== History ==
The city of Arar was founded in 1951, after the construction of the [[Saudi Aramco|Aramco]] oil pipeline ([[Trans-Arabian Pipeline|Tapline]]) was completed. It was initially an [[Pumping (oil well)|oil pumping]] station with a health center and worker housing.  Workers at Arar were primarily from the regions of [[Al-Ahsa Governorate|Al-Ahsa]], [[Ḥa'il Province|Ha'il]], [[Yanbu]] and [[Al Wajh]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Arar got its name from the original oil field that existed before the town, "Field RR", one of many in the country, where it was known by the locals as "R.R." which later became ʿArʿar.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The name Arar means [[juniper]] in Arabic.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bab.la |url=https://en.bab.la/dictionary/arabic-english/عرعر }}</ref>

In 1968, the remains of an ancient city were unearthed 30&nbsp;km from the city of Arar. The site yielded numerous sculptures of fish, turtles and other aquatic animals.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

A summit meeting between [[Saud of Saudi Arabia|King Saud]] and [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] of Jordan took place in Arar during the reigns of the two monarchs.{{when|date=October 2015}}

[[Iraqi Airways Flight 163]], crashed near the [[Arar Domestic Airport|'Ar'ar airport]] on 25 December 1986.<ref>{{Cite news|title=THE WORLD; 62 Are Killed In Hijacking Of Iraqi Jetliner|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/28/weekinreview/the-world-62-are-killed-in-hijacking-of-iraqi-jetliner.html|work=The New York Times|date=28 December 1986}}</ref> The plane was flying from Baghdad, Iraq to Amman, Jordan.

The [[Islamic State]] had planned to attack the city as part of their [[Northern Iraq offensive (June 2014)|2014 insurgency]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/01/isis-destroy-kaaba-mecca_n_5547635.html?&ncid=tweetlnkushpmg00000067 | work=Huffington Post | title=Reported ISIS Member Says They Will Destroy The Kaaba In Mecca, 'Kill Those Who Worship Stones' | date=1 July 2014}}</ref> On 5 January 2015 two Saudi border guards were killed in a suicide attack by the Islamic State at the [[Arar border crossing|Arar Border Crossing]].<ref name=Guardian15>{{cite news |date= 5 January 2015 |title=Two Saudi guards killed in suicide attack on Iraq border |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/05/saudi-guards-killed-suicide-attack-iraq-border-isis |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date= 6 January 2015 }}</ref> However, thereafter ISIS was diminished militarily by other events elsewhere and could not pursue further attacks in the city.
