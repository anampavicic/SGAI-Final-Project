===Origins===
[[File:Escavações no Claustro da Sé de Lisboa.jpg|thumb|left|Phoenician archaeological dig in a cloister of the [[Lisbon Cathedral]]]]

During the [[Neolithic]] period, the region was inhabited by Pre-Celtic tribes, who built religious and funerary monuments, [[megalith]]s, [[dolmen]]s and [[menhir]]s, which still survive in areas on the periphery of Lisbon.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Rodrigo Banha da Silva |title=A ocupação da idade do bronze final da Praça da Figueira (Lisboa): novos e velhos dados sobre os antecedentes da cidade de Lisboa |journal=Cira Arqueologia |date=September 2013 |issue=2, Tejo, palco de interação entre Indígenas e Fenícios |url=http://www.cm-vfxira.pt/files/3/documentos/2013091715584601248.pdf |series=Cira Arqueologia II |publisher=Museu da Rede Portuguesa de Museus |language=pt |access-date=21 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621220603/http://www.cm-vfxira.pt/files/3/documentos/2013091715584601248.pdf |archive-date=21 June 2014}}</ref> The [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Celt]]s invaded in the 1st millennium BC, mixing with the [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|Pre-Indo-European]] population, thus giving rise to Celtic-speaking local tribes such as the Cempsi or [[Sefes]].

Following the defeat of [[Hannibal]] in 202 BC during the [[Punic wars]], the Romans determined to deprive [[Carthage]] of its most valuable possession: [[Hispania]] (the Iberian Peninsula). The defeat of Carthaginian forces by [[Scipio Africanus]] in Eastern Hispania allowed the pacification of the west, led by Consul [[Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus]]. Decimus obtained the alliance of [[Olisipo|Olissipo]] (which sent men to fight alongside the Roman Legions against the northwestern Celtic tribes) by integrating it into the empire, as the ''Municipium Cives Romanorum Felicitas Julia''. Local authorities were granted self-rule over a territory that extended {{cvt|50|km|mi|abbr=off}}; exempt from taxes, its citizens were given the privileges of Roman citizenship,<ref name="Livermore1973" /> and it was then integrated with the Roman province of [[Lusitania]] (whose capital was [[Emerita Augusta]]).

[[Lusitanians|Lusitanian]] raids and rebellions during Roman occupation required the construction of a wall around the settlement. During [[Augustus]]' reign, the Romans also built a great theatre; the Cassian Baths (underneath ''Rua da Prata''); temples to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Cybele]], [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] and Idea [[Phrygia]]e (an uncommon cult from [[Asia Minor]]), in addition to temples to the Emperor; a large [[necropolis]] under ''[[Praça da Figueira]]''; a large forum and other buildings such as [[insula (building)|insulae]] (multi-storied apartment buildings) in the area between Castle Hill and the historic city core. Many of these ruins were first unearthed during the mid-18th century (when the recent discovery of [[Pompeii]] made Roman archaeology fashionable among Europe's upper classes).

The city prospered as [[piracy]] was eliminated and technological advances were introduced, consequently ''Felicitas Julia'' became a center of trade with the Roman provinces of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] (particularly [[Cornwall]]) and the [[Rhine]]. Economically strong, Olissipo was known for its [[garum]] (a fish sauce highly prized by the elites of the empire and exported in [[amphora]]e to Rome), wine, salt, and horse-breeding, while Roman culture permeated the hinterland. The city was connected by a broad road to Western Hispania's two other large cities, [[Bracara Augusta]] in the province of [[Tarraconensis]] (Portuguese [[Braga]]), and [[Emerita Augusta]], the capital of [[Lusitania]]. The city was ruled by an [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] council dominated by two families, the Julii and the Cassiae, although regional authority was administered by the Roman Governor of Emerita or directly by Emperor [[Tiberius]]. Among the majority of [[Latin]] speakers lived a large minority of Greek traders and slaves.

Olissipo, like most great cities in the Western Empire, was a center for the dissemination of Christianity. Its first attested [[Patriarch of Lisbon|Bishop]] was Potamius (c. 356), and there were several [[martyr]]s during the period of persecution of the Christians: [[Holy Martyrs of Lisbon|Verissimus, Maxima, and Julia]] are the most significant examples. By the time of the [[Fall of Rome]], Olissipo had become a notable Christian center.

===Middle Ages===
Following the disintegration of the Western Roman Empire, there were [[barbarian]] invasions; between 409 and 429 the city was occupied successively by [[Sarmatian]]s, [[Alans]] and [[Vandals]]. The Germanic [[Suebi]], who established a kingdom in [[Gallaecia]] (modern [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and northern Portugal), with its capital in ''[[Bracara Augusta]]'', also controlled the region of Lisbon until 585. In 585, the Suebi Kingdom was integrated into the Germanic [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] Kingdom of Toledo, which comprised all of the Iberian Peninsula: Lisbon was then called ''Ulishbona''.

[[File:Siege of Lisbon - Muslim surrender.jpg|thumb|King [[Afonso Henriques]] reconquered the city from the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid Empire]] at the 1147 [[siege of Lisbon]].]]

On 6 August 711, Lisbon was taken by the [[Moors|Muslim]] forces of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. These conquerors built many mosques and houses, rebuilt the city wall (known as the ''Cerca Moura'') and established administrative control, while permitting the diverse population  of [[Muwallad]]s, [[Arabs]], [[Berbers]], [[Mozarabs]], ''[[Saqaliba]]'', and [[Jews]] to maintain their socio-cultural lifestyles. [[Andalusi Romance|Mozarabic]] was the native language spoken by most of the Christian population although Arabic was widely known as spoken by all religious communities. Islam was the official religion practised by the Arabs, Berbers, Saqaliba and Muwallad.

The ancient Muslim influence is still visible in the [[Alfama]] district, an old quarter of Lisbon that survived the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]]: many place-names are derived from Arabic and the Alfama (the oldest existing district of Lisbon) was derived from the Arabic "''al-hamma''{{-"}}.

For a brief time, Lisbon was an independent Muslim kingdom known as the [[Taifa of Lisbon]] (1022–1094), before being conquered by the larger [[Taifa of Badajoz]].

In 1108 Lisbon was raided and occupied by [[Norway|Norwegian]] crusaders led by [[Sigurd I of Norway|Sigurd I]] on their way to the [[Holy Land]] as part of the [[Norwegian Crusade]] and occupied by crusader forces for three years.<ref>Pires, Helio. "Sigurđr's Attack on Lisbon: Where Exactly?" In ''Viking and Medieval Scandinavia'' 8 (2012) – Turnhout, Belgium: Brepols Publishers, c=2012, pp. 199–205.</ref> It was taken by the Moorish [[Almoravids]] in 1111.
[[File:Siege of Lisbon 1384.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Siege of Lisbon (1384)|1384 siege of Lisbon]] in [[Froissart's Chronicles]]]]

In 1147, as part of [[Portugal in the Reconquista|Portuguese efforts during the ''Reconquista'']], [[Afonso I of Portugal]] [[Siege of Lisbon|besieged and reconquered Lisbon]] with the aid of crusader knights. The city, with around 154,000 residents at the time, was returned to Christian rule. The reconquest of Portugal and re-establishment of [[Christianity]] is one of the most significant events in Lisbon's history, described in the chronicle ''[[Expugnatione Lyxbonensi]]'', which describes, among other incidents, how the local bishop was killed by the crusaders and the city's residents prayed to the [[Virgin Mary]] as it happened. Some of the Muslim residents converted to Roman Catholicism and most of those who did not convert fled to other parts of the Islamic world, primarily [[Muslim Spain]] and [[North Africa]]. All mosques were either destroyed or altered and converted into churches. As a result of the end of Muslim rule in the mid-12th century, spoken Arabic quickly lost its place in Lisbon, and disappeared altogether.

With its central location, Lisbon became the capital city of the new Portuguese territory in 1255.
The first Portuguese university was founded in Lisbon in 1290 by King [[Dinis I of Portugal|Denis I]]; for many years the ''[[Studium Generale]]'' (''General Study'') was transferred intermittently to [[Coimbra]], where it was installed permanently in the 16th century as the [[University of Coimbra]].

In 1384, the city was besieged by King [[Juan I of Castille]], as a part of the ongoing [[1383–1385 Crisis]]. The result of the siege was a victory for the Portuguese led by [[Nuno Álvares Pereira]].

During the last centuries of the Middle Ages, Lisbon expanded substantially and became an important trading post with both [[Northern Europe]]an and Mediterranean cities.

When the Spaniards expelled the Jews from Spanish territory, many of them fled to Lisbon. Although acknowledging the central importance of the Jews to the city's prosperity, [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] decreed in 1497 that all Jews must convert to Christianity, only those who refused being forced to leave, but not before the expropriation of their property.<ref name="Roitman2011">{{cite book |author=Jessica V.

Most of the Portuguese expeditions of the [[Age of Discovery]] set out from Lisbon during the period from the end of the 15th century to the beginning of the 17th century, including [[Vasco da Gama]]'s expedition to [[India]] in 1498. The following years of the 16th century began Lisbon's golden era: the city was the European hub of commerce between [[History of Portugal (1415–1578)|Africa]], [[Portuguese India|India]], the [[Nanban trade|Far East]] and later, [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]], and acquired great riches by exploiting the trade in spices, slaves, sugar, textiles and other goods. This period saw the rise of the exuberant [[Manueline]] style in architecture, which left its mark in many 16th-century monuments (including Lisbon's [[Belém Tower]] and [[Jerónimos Monastery]], which were declared [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]]). A description of Lisbon in the 16th century was written by [[Damião de Góis]] and published in 1554.<ref>{{citation |contribution=Urbis Olisiponis descriptio |orig-year=1554 |year=1996 |title=Lisbon in the Renaissance |editor=Jeffrey S.

In 1589, Lisbon was the target of an incursion by the [[English Armada]] led by [[Francis Drake]], while [[Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth]] supported a Portuguese [[pretender]] in [[Antonio, Prior of Crato]], but support for Crato was lacking and the expedition was a failure. The [[Portuguese Restoration War]], which began with a [[coup d'état]] organised by the nobility and [[bourgeois]]ie in Lisbon and executed on 1 December 1640, restored Portuguese independence. The period from 1640 to 1668 was marked by periodic skirmishes between Portugal and Spain, as well as short episodes of more serious warfare until the [[Treaty of Lisbon (1668)|Treaty of Lisbon]] was signed in 1668.

In the early 18th century, gold from Brazil allowed [[John V of Portugal|King John V]] to sponsor the building of several [[Baroque]] churches and theatres in the city. Prior to the 18th century, Lisbon had experienced several significant earthquakes – eight in the 14th century, five in the 16th century (including the [[1531 Lisbon earthquake|1531 earthquake]] that destroyed 1,500 houses and the 1597 earthquake in which three streets vanished), and three in the 17th century.

On 1 November 1755, the city was destroyed by another [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|devastating earthquake]], which killed an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Lisbon residents<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.york.ac.uk/res/cherry/docs/Alvaro3.pdf |title=The Opportunity of a Disaster: The Economic Impact of the Lisbon 1755 Earthquake |last=Pereira |first=A.S. |date=March 2006 |publisher=Centre for Historical Economics and Related Research at York, York University |access-date=21 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605222012/http://www.york.ac.uk/res/cherry/docs/Alvaro3.pdf |archive-date=5 June 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> of a population estimated at between 200,000 and 275,000,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.york.ac.uk/res/cherry/docs/Alvaro3.pdf |title=The Economic Impact of the Lisbon 1755 Earthquake – p. 8, estimates a population of 200,000 |date=March 2006 |access-date=21 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605222012/http://www.york.ac.uk/res/cherry/docs/Alvaro3.pdf |archive-date=5 June 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://nisee.berkeley.edu/lisbon/index.html |title=Historical Depictions of the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake, citing an unreferenced estimate of 275,000 |publisher=Nisee.berkeley.edu |date=12 November 1998 |access-date=21 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311082423/http://nisee.berkeley.edu/lisbon/index.html |archive-date=11 March 2011}}</ref> and destroyed 85 percent of the city's structures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nisee.berkeley.edu/lisbon/index.html |title=Historical Depictions of the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake |publisher=Nisee.berkeley.edu |date=12 November 1998 |access-date=21 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311082423/http://nisee.berkeley.edu/lisbon/index.html |archive-date=11 March 2011}}</ref> Among several important buildings of the city, the [[Ribeira Palace]] and the [[Hospital Real de Todos os Santos]] were lost.

By 1755, Lisbon was one of the largest cities in Europe; the catastrophic event shocked the whole of Europe and left a deep impression on its collective psyche. [[Voltaire]] wrote a long poem, ''Poême sur le désastre de Lisbonne'', shortly after the quake, and mentioned it in his 1759 novel ''[[Candide]]'' (indeed, many argue that this critique of [[optimism]] was inspired by that earthquake). [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.]] also mentions it in his 1857 poem, ''The Deacon's Masterpiece, or The Wonderful One-Hoss Shay''.

After the 1755 earthquake, the city was rebuilt largely according to the plans of Prime Minister [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo]], the [[Marquis of Pombal|1st Marquis of Pombal]]; the lower town began to be known as the ''Baixa Pombalina'' ([[Pombaline Lower Town|Pombaline central district]]). Instead of rebuilding the medieval town, Pombal decided to demolish what remained after the earthquake and rebuild the city centre in accordance with principles of modern urban design. It was reconstructed in an open rectangular plan with two great squares: the ''[[Praça do Rossio]]'' and the ''[[Praça do Comércio]]''. The first, the central commercial district, is the traditional gathering place of the city and the location of the older cafés, theatres and restaurants; the second became the city's main access to the River Tagus and point of departure and arrival for seagoing vessels, adorned by a triumphal arch (1873) and a monument to King [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]].

===Modern era===
[[File:Proclamação República Portuguesa.jpg|thumb|right|The [[5 October 1910 revolution|Proclamation of the Portuguese Republic]] in 1910]]

In the first years of the 19th century, Portugal was invaded by the troops of [[Napoléon Bonaparte]], forcing Queen [[Maria I of Portugal|Maria I]] and Prince-Regent [[John VI of Portugal|John]] (future John VI) to flee temporarily to Brazil. By the time the new King returned to Lisbon, many of the buildings and properties were pillaged, sacked or destroyed by the invaders.

During the 19th century, the Liberal movement introduced new changes into the urban landscape. The principal areas were in the ''Baixa'' and along the ''Chiado'' district, where shops, tobacconists shops, cafés, bookstores, clubs and theatres proliferated. The development of industry and commerce determined the growth of the city, seeing the transformation of the [[Passeio Público (Lisbon)|Passeio Público]], a Pombaline era park, into the [[Avenida da Liberdade]], as the city grew farther from the Tagus.

Lisbon was the site of the [[Lisbon Regicide|regicide]] of [[Carlos I of Portugal]] in 1908, an event which culminated two years later in the establishment of the First Republic.
[[File:Lisbon, the Palácio Nacional da Ajuda.JPG|thumb|The [[Palace of Ajuda]] was built as a residence for the [[King of Portugal]] following the [[1755 Lisbon Earthquake]].]]
[[File:Teatro Dona Maria II (2.ª metade do séc. XIX) (cropped).png|thumb|[[D. Maria II National Theatre|Queen Maria II National Theatre]] was built in 1842.]]

The city refounded its university in 1911 after centuries of inactivity in Lisbon, incorporating reformed former colleges and other non-university higher education schools of the city (such as the ''Escola Politécnica'' – now ''Faculdade de Ciências''). Today there are two public universities in the city ([[University of Lisbon]] and [[New University of Lisbon]]), a public university institute ([[ISCTE - Lisbon University Institute]]) and a [[polytechnic (Portugal)|polytechnic]] institute (IPL – [[Instituto Politécnico de Lisboa]]).

During [[Portugal in World War II|World War II]], Lisbon was one of the very few neutral, open European Atlantic ports, a major gateway for refugees to the U.S. and a haven for spies. More than 100,000 refugees were able to flee [[Nazi Germany]] via Lisbon.<ref>"[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Portugal.html Portugal] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170121130631/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Portugal.html |date=21 January 2017 }}".

During the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime (1926–1974), Lisbon, under the influence of [[Duarte Pacheco]], the minister of works, was expanded at the cost of other districts within the country, resulting in nationalist and monumental projects. New residential and public developments were constructed; the zone of [[Belém (Lisbon)|Belém]] was modified for the [[Portuguese World Exhibition|1940 Portuguese Exhibition]], while along the periphery new districts appeared to house the growing population. The inauguration of the bridge over the Tagus allowed a rapid connection between both sides of the river.

Lisbon was the site of three revolutions in the 20th century. The first, the [[5 October 1910 revolution]], brought an end to the [[Portuguese monarchy]] and established the highly unstable and corrupt [[Portuguese First Republic]]. The [[28 May 1926 coup d'état|6 June 1926 revolution]] ended the first republic and firmly established the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]], or the [[Portuguese Second Republic]], as the ruling regime.

===Contemporary===
The [[Carnation Revolution]], which took place on 25 April 1974, ended the right-wing [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime and reformed the country to become as it is today, the [[Portuguese Third Republic]].

In the 1990s, many of the districts were renovated and projects in the historic quarters were established to modernise those areas, for instance, architectural and patrimonial buildings were renovated, the northern margin of the Tagus was re-purposed for leisure and residential use, the [[Vasco da Gama Bridge]] was constructed and the eastern part of the municipality was re-purposed for [[Expo '98]] to commemorate the 500th anniversary of [[Vasco da Gama]]'s sea voyage to India, a voyage that would bring immense riches to Lisbon and cause many of Lisbon's landmarks to be built.

In 1988, a fire in the historical district of [[Chiado]] saw the destruction of many 18th-century [[Pombaline style]] buildings. A series of restoration works has brought the area back to its former self and made it a high-scale shopping district.
[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (08) edited.jpg|thumb|The [[Treaty of Lisbon]], which forms the constitutional basis of the [[European Union]], was signed at the [[Jerónimos Monastery]] in 2007.]]
The [[Lisbon Agenda]] was a European Union agreement on measures to revitalise the EU economy, signed in Lisbon in March 2000. In October 2007 Lisbon hosted the [[2007 EU Summit]], where an agreement was reached regarding a new EU governance model. The resulting [[Treaty of Lisbon]] was signed on 13 December 2007 and came into force on 1 December 2009.

Lisbon has been the site for many international events and programmes. In 1994, Lisbon was the [[European Capital of Culture]]. On 3 November 2005, Lisbon hosted the [[MTV Europe Music Awards 2005|MTV European Music Awards]]. On 7 July 2007, Lisbon held the ceremony of the "New 7 Wonders Of The World"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.new7wonders.com/index.php?id=315&L=0 |title=Welcome to the official global voting platform of |publisher=New7Wonders |access-date=8 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091220070115/http://www.new7wonders.com/index.php?id=315&L=0 |archive-date=20 December 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref> election, in the [[Estádio da Luz|Luz Stadium]], with live transmission for millions of people all over the world.

===Neighborhoods===
{{wide image|Lisboa-lisbon- panorama.jpg|940px|align-cap=center|View of Lisbon's waterfront districts from the [[Christ the King (Almada)|Christ the King]] viewpoint.}}

Locally, Lisbon's inhabitants may commonly refer to the spaces of Lisbon in terms of historic ''Bairros de Lisboa'' ([[Bairro|neighbourhoods]]). These communities have no clearly defined boundaries and represent distinctive quarters of the city that have in common a historical culture, similar living standards, and identifiable architectural landmarks, as exemplified by the ''Bairro Alto'', ''Alfama'', ''Chiado'', and so forth.

====Alcântara====
{{main|Alcântara, Lisbon|l1=Alcântara}}
[[File:Capela de Santo Amaro - Lisboa - Portugal (37047725223).jpg|thumb|Santo Amaro, Alcântara]]

Alcântara is situated along the northern bank of the Tagus River, between the parishes of Belém to the west and Estrela to the east. Its proximity to both the city centre and the riverside makes it a well-connected and popular area for both locals and tourists. Although today it is quite central, it was once a mere suburb of Lisbon, comprising mostly farms and country estates of the nobility with their palaces. Amongst the palaces found in the neighbourhood the most notable are:
* Palácio da Ega (16th century), now hosting the [[Arquivo Histórico Ultramarino]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Palácio da Ega – Arquivo Histórico Ultramarino |url=https://www.trienaldelisboa.com/ohl/espaco/palacio-da-ega-arquivo-historico-ultramarino-2/ |access-date=2024-10-19 |website=www.trienaldelisboa.com |language=pt-pt}}</ref>

In the 16th century, there was a brook there which the nobles used to promenade in their boats.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Alcântara became a popular industrial area, with many small factories and warehouses and docks along the waterfront. The presence of these industries attracted many working-class families.
[[File:DF1 9862 (45046589254).jpg|thumb|Lx Factory in Alcântara]]
[[File:Palácio Burnay 7718.jpg|thumb|Palácio Burnay, Alcântara]]
By the mid-20th century, the area had experienced some decline as industries closed down. However, since the late 20th century, Alcântara has seen revitalisation, with many of the old factories repurposed into trendy spaces such as art galleries, nightclubs, and creative hubs. In the early 1990s, Alcântara began to attract youth because of the number of pubs and discothèques. This was mainly due to its outer area of mostly commercial buildings, which acted as barriers to the noise-generating nightlife (which acted as a buffer to the residential communities surrounding it). In the meantime, some of these areas began to become gentrified, attracting loft developments and new flats, which have profited from its river views and central location.

Alcântara has emerged as one of Lisbon's most dynamic areas for nightlife and culture. The riverfront of Alcântara is known for its nightclubs and bars. The area is commonly known as ''docas'' (docks), since most of the clubs and bars are housed in converted dock warehouses.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Leandro |first=Valter |date=2022-11-16 |title=Um fim de semana na zona das Docas de Santo Amaro, em Alcântara |url=https://lisboasecreta.co/docas-de-santo-amaro-em-alcantara/ |access-date=2024-10-19 |website=Lisboa Secreta |language=pt-PT}}</ref>

Key places of interest/cultural landmarks in the neighbourhood include:
* '''LX Factory''': A cultural and creative complex housed in a former industrial site now home to cafes, restaurants, co-working spaces, shops, and art installations. LX Factory frequently hosts markets, exhibitions, and live performances<ref>{{Cite web |title=LxFactory {{!}} Restaurants, Bars, Shops & Offices in Alcantara |url=https://lxfactory.com/en/homepage-en/ |access-date=2024-10-19 |website=Lx Factory |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Os restaurantes e as lojas: um guia completo para redescobrir a Lx Factory |url=https://www.timeout.pt/lisboa/pt/coisas-para-fazer/coisas-para-fazer-na-lx-factory}}</ref>
* '''Village Underground''': An innovative cultural space made of recycled shipping containers and old buses, used as offices, restaurants, and even a stage for performances. It exemplifies the creative reuse of industrial spaces in Alcântara.<ref>{{Cite web |title=HOME |url=https://vulisboa.com/ |access-date=2024-10-19 |website=village underground lisboa |language=pt-PT}}</ref>
* '''Museums''': Many museums can be found in Alcantara, including the "Museu de Macau" (Macau Museum),<ref>{{Cite web |title=Museu |url=https://www.cccm.gov.pt/museu/ |access-date=2024-10-19 |website=CCCM, I.P.}}</ref> "Museu da Carris" (Carris - Public transportation museum),<ref>{{Cite web |title=Homepage Museu {{!}} Museu da Carris |url=https://museu.carris.pt/en/homepage-museu/ |access-date=2024-10-19 |language=en-GB}}</ref> the "B-Mad museum" (Berardo - Museum Art Deco)<ref>{{Cite web |title=BMAD .

* '''Pilar 7''': situated within one of the massive support pillars of the 25 de Abril Bridge. It was created to offer visitors a closer look at the bridge's architectural and engineering marvel, providing access to areas of the bridge that would otherwise be off-limits. The main focus is on the structural aspects and construction of the bridge, but it also incorporates interactive exhibits and a viewpoint.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=T: +351 210 312 700 |last2=F: +351 210 312 899 |last3=Atl@visitlisboa.com |last4=Www.visitlisboa.com |title=Experiência Pilar 7 |url=https://www.visitlisboa.com/pt-pt/locais/experiencia-pilar-7 |access-date=2024-10-19 |website=Turismo de Lisboa |language=pt-pt}}</ref>

The neighbourhood is also noticeable for hosting the "Lisbon Congress Centre" (Centro de congressos de Lisboa),<ref>{{Cite web |title=CCL - Centro de Congressos de Lisboa |url=https://ccl.lisbonvenues.pt/ |access-date=2024-10-19 |website=CCL |language=pt-pt}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Centro de Congressos de Lisboa |url=https://informacoeseservicos.lisboa.pt/contactos/diretorio-da-cidade/centro-de-congressos-de-lisboa}}</ref> the Lisbon Metropolitan Orchestra (Orquestra Metropolitana de Lisboa)<ref>{{Cite web |title=Homepage |url=https://www.metropolitana.pt/ |access-date=2024-10-19 |website=Metropolitana}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=AMEC {{!}} Metropolitana |url=https://informacoeseservicos.lisboa.pt/contactos/diretorio-da-cidade/amec-metropolitana}}</ref> and the [[Arquivo Histórico Ultramarino]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Arquivo Histórico Ultramarino |url=https://ahu.dglab.gov.pt/}}</ref>

====Alfama====
{{Main|Alfama}}
[[File:A ver S. Vicente.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alfama]], with the churches of [[Monastery of São Vicente de Fora|S. Vicente de Fora]], [[Church of Santa Engrácia|S. Engrácia]], and [[Igreja de Santo Estêvão (Lisbon)|S. Estêvão]], and the Tagus river behind]]

Alfama, the oldest district of Lisbon, spreads down the southern slope from the [[São Jorge Castle|Castle of São Jorge]] to the [[River Tagus]]. Its name, derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''Al-hamma'', means fountains or baths. During the [[Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula|Islamic invasion of Iberia]], the Alfama constituted the largest part of the city, extending west to the [[Baixa]] neighbourhood. Increasingly, the Alfama became inhabited by fishermen and the poor: its fame as a poor neighbourhood continues to this day.  Many of the buildings date back to the 18th century, showcasing traditional Portuguese architecture, complete with colorful tiled facades and wrought-iron balconies. While the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] caused considerable damage throughout the capital, the Alfama  was largely spared  and survived with little damage, thanks to its compact labyrinth of narrow streets and small squares.

This historic district has retained much of its original character. It is a historical quarter of mixed-use buildings occupied by [[Fado]] bars, restaurants, and homes with small shops downstairs. Fado, the typically Portuguese style of melancholy music, is common (but not obligatory) in the restaurants of the district.

Modernising trends have invigorated the district: old houses have been re-purposed or remodelled, while new buildings have been constructed.

Alfama hosts several events throughout the year, including the popular '''Festas de Santo António''', where locals celebrate with street parties, music, and food. This vibrant atmosphere showcases the community's spirit and connection to its cultural roots.

Key places of interest/cultural landmarks in the neighbourhood include:
* '''São Jorge Castle''': historic [[castle]] which has been continuously occupied for the last 3,000 years<ref>{{Cite web |title=Castelo de São Jorge |url=https://castelodesaojorge.pt/en/ |access-date=2024-10-19 |website=castelodesaojorge.pt}}</ref>
* '''Miradouros''': Amongst the most emblematic viewpoints there are Miradouro de Santa Luzia (where the Igreja de Santa Luzia e de São Brás stands) and the Miradouro das Portas do Sol.
* '''Museums''': Many museums can be found in Alfama, including the "Museu de Santo António" (Saint Anthony Museum),<ref>{{Cite web |title=Santo António |url=https://www.museudelisboa.pt/pt/nucleos/santo-antonio |access-date=2024-10-19 |website=Museu de Lisboa |language=pt}}</ref> "Museu do Aljube - Resistência e Liberdade" (Aljube - Estado Novo dictatorship museum),<ref>{{Cite web |title=Museu do Aljube |url=https://www.museudoaljube.pt/ |access-date=2024-10-19 |website=Museu do Aljube |language=pt}}</ref> the "Museu do Teatro Romano" (Roman Theatre Museum),<ref>{{Cite web |title=Teatro Romano |url=https://www.museudelisboa.pt/pt/nucleos/teatro-romano |access-date=2024-10-19 |website=Museu de Lisboa |language=pt}}</ref> the "Fundação José Saramago" (José Saramago Foundation)<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fundação José Saramago |url=https://www.josesaramago.org/ |access-date=2024-10-19 |website=Fundação José Saramago |language=pt-PT}}</ref> and the "Museu de Artes Decorativas Portuguesas" (Museum of Portuguese Decorative Arts)<ref>{{Cite web |last=Comercial |date=2019-03-19 |title=Um Projeto Original - FRESS |url=https://www.fress.pt/museu/um-projeto-original/?v=0b3b97fa6688 |access-date=2024-10-19 |website=www.fress.pt |language=pt-pt}}</ref>

====Bairro Alto====
{{Main|Bairro Alto}}

[[File:Bairro Alto, Lisbon (34487234082).jpg|thumb|right|''[[Duke of Cadaval]] Square'', bordering [[Bairro Alto]] and the [[Baixa Pombalina]]]]

Bairro Alto (literally ''the upper quarter'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) is an area of central Lisbon that functions as a residential, shopping and entertainment district; it is the center of the Portuguese capital's nightlife, attracting hipster youth and members of various music subcultures. Lisbon's [[Punk subculture|punk]], [[Gay (term)|gay]], metal, [[Goth subculture|goth]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[reggae]] scenes all find a home in the ''Bairro'' with its many clubs and bars that cater to them. The crowds in the Bairro Alto are a multicultural mix of people representing a broad cross-section of modern Portuguese society, many of them being entertainment seekers and devotees of various music genres outside the mainstream, [[Fado]], Portugal's national music, still survives in the midst of the new nightlife.

====Baixa====
[[File:View from the São Jorge Castle, including the Praça do Comércio on the waterfront.jpg|thumb|View from the São Jorge Castle, including the Praça do Comércio on the waterfront]]{{Main|Baixa Pombalina}}
The heart of the city is the ''[[Baixa]]'' or city centre; the Pombaline Baixa is an elegant district, primarily constructed after the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]], taking its name from its benefactor, [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal]], who was the minister of [[Joseph I of Portugal]] (1750–1777) and a key figure during the Portuguese [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Following the 1755 disaster, Pombal took the lead in rebuilding Lisbon, imposing strict conditions and guidelines on the construction of the city, and transforming the organic street plan that characterised the district before the earthquake into its current grid pattern. As a result, the Pombaline Baixa is one of the first examples of [[earthquake construction|earthquake-resistant construction]]. Architectural models were tested by having troops march around them to simulate an earthquake. Notable features of Pombaline structures include the Pombaline cage, a symmetrical wood-lattice framework aimed at distributing earthquake forces, and inter-terrace walls that were built higher than roof timbers to inhibit the spread of fires.

====Beato====
[[File:Teatro_Ibérico_(cropped).jpg|thumb|Facade of Teatro Ibérico, in Beato]]

The parish of [[Beato, Lisbon|Beato]] stands out for the new cultural dynamics it has been experiencing in recent years. The manufacturing districts and the industrial facilities by the riverside docks are the place of choice for contemporary art galleries, iconic bars, and gourmet restaurants that simmer in the streets. This reality has not gone unnoticed by the national press, and Visão,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://visao.sapo.pt/visaose7e/sair/2018-06-08-tudo-o-que-ha-para-ver-e-fazer-de-marvila-ao-beato/ |title=Tudo o que há para ver e fazer de Marvila ao Beato |last=Revista |first=Visão |date=June 2018 |website=Visao |access-date=14 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114020238/https://visao.sapo.pt/visaose7e/sair/2018-06-08-tudo-o-que-ha-para-ver-e-fazer-de-marvila-ao-beato/ |archive-date=14 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> TimeOut,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.timeout.pt/lisboa/pt/coisas-para-fazer/roteiro-perfeito-em-marvila |title=Roteiro perfeito em Marvila |last=Revista |first=TimeOut |date=December 2019 |website=TimeOut |access-date=14 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114020238/https://www.timeout.pt/lisboa/pt/coisas-para-fazer/roteiro-perfeito-em-marvila |archive-date=14 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> or Jornal de Negócios<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jornaldenegocios.pt/weekend/detalhe/lisboa-o-circulo-alternativo-das-galerias-de-arte |title=Lisboa: ocírculo alternativo das galerias de arte |last=de Negócios |first=Jornal |date=May 2017 |website=Jornal de Negócios |access-date=14 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114020238/https://www.jornaldenegocios.pt/weekend/detalhe/lisboa-o-circulo-alternativo-das-galerias-de-arte |archive-date=14 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> have already made notice of this parish that hides treasures such as the [[National Museum of the Azulejo]] or the [[Palacio do Grilo]].

====Belém====
{{Main|Santa Maria de Belém|l1=Belém}}

Belém is famous as the place from which many of the great [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers set off on their voyages of discovery. In particular, it is the place from which [[Vasco da Gama]] departed for [[India]] in 1497 and Pedro Álvares Cabral departed for Brazil in 1499. It is also a former royal residence and features the 17th – 18th-century [[Belém Palace]], a former royal residence now occupied by the [[President of Portugal]], and the [[Ajuda Palace]], begun in 1802 but never completed.

Perhaps Belém's most famous feature is its tower, [[Belém Tower|Torre de Belém]], whose image is much used by Lisbon's tourist board. The tower was built as a fortified lighthouse late in the reign of [[Manuel I of Portugal|Dom Manuel l]] (1515–1520) to guard the entrance to the port. It stood on a little island on the right side of the [[Tagus]], surrounded by water. Belém's other major historical building is the ''[[Jerónimos Monastery, Lisbon|Mosteiro dos Jerónimos]]'' (Jerónimos Monastery), which the [[Belém Tower|Torre de Belém]] was built partly to defend. Belém's most notable modern feature is the [[Padrão dos Descobrimentos]] (Monument to the Discoveries) built for the Portuguese World Fair in 1940. In the heart of Belém is the ''Praça do Império'': gardens centred upon a large fountain, laid out during [[World War II]]. To the west of the gardens lies the ''[[Centro Cultural de Belém]]''. Belém is one of the most visited Lisbon districts. Here is located the [[Estádio do Restelo]], home to [[C.F. Os Belenenses|Belenenses]].

{{wide image|JeronimosLisbon (cropped).jpg|1000px|align-cap=center|View of [[Jerónimos Monastery]] and ''Praça do Império'' (Empire Square) from the top of the ''[[Padrão dos Descobrimentos]]'' in [[Belém (Lisbon)|Belém]]}}

====Chiado====
{{Main|Chiado}}
[[File:PlazaDeCamoesLisboa-P1100966-P1100968.jpg|thumb|Monument to [[Luís de Camões]], considered the greatest poet of the [[Portuguese language]], in [[Chiado]]]]

The Chiado is a traditional shopping area that mixes old and modern commercial establishments, concentrated specially in the Rua do Carmo and the Rua Garrett. Locals as well as tourists visit the Chiado to buy books, clothing and pottery as well as to have a cup of coffee. The most famous café of Chiado is ''[[A Brasileira]]'', famous for having had poet [[Fernando Pessoa]] among its customers. The Chiado is also an important cultural area, with several museums and theatres, including the opera. Several buildings of the Chiado were destroyed in a fire in 1988, an event that deeply shocked the country. Thanks to a renovation project that lasted more than 10 years, coordinated by celebrated architect [[Siza Vieira]], the affected area has now virtually recovered.

====Estrela====

The ornate, late 18th-century [[Estrela Basilica]] is the main attraction of this district. The church with its large dome is located on a hill in what was at the time the western part of Lisbon and can be seen from great distances. The style is similar to that of the [[Mafra National Palace]], late baroque and neoclassical. The façade has twin bell towers and includes statues of saints and some allegorical figures. [[São Bento Palace]], the seat of the Portuguese parliament and the official residences of the [[Prime Minister of Portugal]] and the President of the [[Assembly of the Republic of Portugal]], are in this district. Also in this district is Estrela Park, a favorite with families. There are exotic plants and trees, a duck pond, various sculptures, a children's playground, and many cultural events going on throughout the year, including outdoor cinema, markets, and music festivals.

====Parque das Nações====
{{Main|Parque das Nações}}
[[File:Lisbon 120 (31787634704).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Parque das Nações]] district was initially built for the [[Expo '98|Lisbon World Expo]].]]

Parque das Nações (Park of Nations) is the newest district in Lisbon; it emerged from an urban renewal program to host the 1998 World Exhibition of Lisbon, also known as Expo'98. The area suffered massive changes giving Parque das Nações a futuristic look. A long-lasting legacy of the same, the area has become another commercial and higher-end residential area for the city.

Central in the area is the [[Gare do Oriente]] (Orient railway station), one of the main transport hubs of Lisbon for trains, buses, taxis, and the metro. Its glass and steel columns are inspired by Gothic architecture, lending the whole structure a visual fascination (especially in sunlight or when illuminated at night). It was designed by the architect [[Santiago Calatrava]] from [[Valencia]], Spain. The Parque das Nações is across the street.

The area is pedestrian-friendly with new buildings, restaurants, gardens, the [[Casino Lisboa, Portugal|Casino Lisbon]], the FIL building (International Exhibition and Fair), the Camões Theatre and the ''Oceanário de Lisboa'' ([[Lisbon Oceanarium]]), which is the second-largest in the world. The district's [[Altice Arena]] has become Lisbon's "jack-of-all-trades" performance arena. With seating for 20,000, it has staged events ranging from concerts to basketball tournaments.

[[File:Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga2075 (cropped).jpg|thumb|The [[National Museum of Ancient Art]] has one of the [[List of largest art museums|largest art collections in the world]].]]

The city of Lisbon is rich in architecture; [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Manueline]], [[Baroque]], [[Modernism|Modern]] and [[Postmodern]] constructions can be found all over Lisbon. The city is also crossed by historical boulevards and monuments along the main thoroughfares, particularly in the upper districts; notable among these are the ''[[Avenida da Liberdade]]'' (Avenue of Liberty), ''Avenida Fontes Pereira de Melo'', ''Avenida Almirante Reis'' and ''Avenida da República'' (Avenue of the Republic).

Lisbon is home to numerous prominent museums and art collections, from all around the world. The [[National Museum of Ancient Art]], which has one of the [[List of largest art museums|largest art collections in the world]], and the [[National Coach Museum]], which has the world's largest collection of royal coaches and carriages, are the two most visited museums in the city. Other notable national museums include the [[National Museum of Archaeology, Lisbon|National Museum of Archaeology]], the [[Museum of Lisbon]], the [[National Museum of the Azulejo|National Azulejo Museum]], the [[National Museum of Contemporary Art of Chiado|National Museum of Contemporary Art]], and the [[National Museum of Natural History and Science, Lisbon|National Museum of Natural History & Science]].
[[File:Torre Belém April 2009-4a.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Belém Tower]], one of the most famous and visited landmarks in Lisbon and throughout Portugal]]

Prominent private museums and galleries include the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Museum|Gulbenkian Museum]] (run by the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]], one of the [[List of wealthiest charitable foundations|wealthiest foundations in the world]]), which houses one of the largest private collections of antiquities and art in the world, the [[Berardo Collection Museum|Contemporary Art Museum - Centro Cultural de Belém]], the [[Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology]], and the [[Museum of the Orient]]. Other popular museums include the [[Electricity Museum]], the [[Ephemeral Museum]], the [[Museu da Água]], and the [[Museu Benfica]], among many others.

Lisbon's Opera House, the ''[[Teatro Nacional de São Carlos]]'', hosts a relatively active cultural agenda, mainly in autumn and winter. Other important theatres and musical houses are the ''[[Belém Cultural Center|Centro Cultural de Belém]]'', the ''[[D. Maria II National Theatre|Teatro Nacional D. Maria II]]'', the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation|Gulbenkian Foundation]], and the ''Teatro Camões''.

The monument to ''Christ the King'' ([[Christ the King (Almada)|Cristo-Rei]]) stands on the southern bank of the Tagus River, in [[Almada]]. With open arms, overlooking the whole city, it resembles the Corcovado monument in [[Rio de Janeiro]], and was built after [[World War II]], as a memorial of thanksgiving for Portugal's being spared the horrors and destruction of the war.
[[File:Museo gulbekian, sala del mobilio francese.jpg|thumb|The [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]] is one of the [[List of wealthiest charitable foundations|wealthiest foundations in the world]] and houses one of the largest private collections of antiquaries and art in the world, within the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Museum|Gulbenkian Museum]].]]

13 June is Lisbon's holiday in honour of the city's saint, [[Anthony of Lisbon]] ({{langx|pt|Santo António}}). Saint Anthony, also known as ''Saint Anthony of Padua'', was a wealthy Portuguese bohemian who was [[Canonization|canonised]] and made [[Doctor of the Church]] after a life preaching to the poor. Although Lisbon's patron saint is Saint [[Vincent of Saragossa]], whose remains are housed in the [[Lisbon Cathedral|Sé Cathedral]], there are no festivities associated with this saint.

[[Eduardo VII Park]], the second-largest park in the city following the ''Parque Florestal de Monsanto'' ([[Monsanto Forest Park]]), extends down the main avenue ([[Avenida da Liberdade]]), with many flowering plants and green spaces, that includes the permanent collection of subtropical and tropical plants in the winter garden ({{langx|pt|Estufa Fria}}). Originally named ''Parque da Liberdade'', it was renamed in honour of [[Edward VII]] who visited Lisbon in 1903.

Lisbon has two sites listed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]]: [[Belém Tower]] and [[Jerónimos Monastery]]. Furthermore, in 1994, Lisbon was the [[European Capital of Culture]] and, in 1998, organised the [[Expo '98]] (''1998 Lisbon World Exposition'').

Lisbon hosts many fine examples of Portuguese [[azulejo]] tile art, a use of ceramic tile as an architectural finish for both building interiors and exteriors dating from the 15th Century. This art form is celebrated in Lisbon's [[National Museum of the Azulejo]] and as a station feature in the [[Lisbon metro]]. In addition, the mosaic [[Portuguese pavement]] (''Calçada Portuguesa'') was born in Lisbon, in the mid-1800s. The art has since spread to the rest of the Portuguese Speaking world. The city remains one of the most expansive examples of the technique, nearly all walkways and even many streets being created and maintained in this style.

In May 2018, the city hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018|63rd edition of the Eurovision Song Contest]], after the victory of [[Salvador Sobral]] with the song "''[[Amar pelos dois]]''" in [[Kyiv]] on 13 May 2017.

[[World Youth Day 2023]] was hosted in August of that year in Lisbon, attracting hundreds of thousands of young Catholics from over 140 countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/254967/world-youth-day-2023-lisbon-patriarch-greets-attendees-at-opening-mass|title=World Youth Day 2023: Lisbon patriarch greets attendees at opening Mass|first=Jonah|last=McKeown|date=1 August 2023|website=[[Catholic News Agency]]}}</ref>

Lisbon has 567,131 inhabitants within the administrative center on the area of only 100.05&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup><ref name="dgt" /> The population density of the city itself is {{cvt|5668.5|PD/sqkm}}.

The Lisbon metropolitan area incorporates two [[NUTS III]] (European statistical subdivisions): ''[[Grande Lisboa]]'' (Greater Lisbon), along the northern bank of the [[Tagus River]], and ''[[Península de Setúbal]]'' (Setúbal Peninsula), along the southern bank. These two subdivisions make for the ''[[Região de Lisboa]]'' (Lisbon Region).

Lisbon's population has steadily dropped over the years due to people searching better accommodations for lower prices elsewhere in Greater Lisbon. A reverse trend has been observed in recent years, with the population increasing to 567,131 people in 2023, an all-time high since 2001 census and a 4.52% increase since the 2011 census.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |title=População residente (N.º) por Local de residência (NUTS - 2013), Sexo e Grupo etário (Por ciclos de vida); Anual |url=https://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xpid=INE&xpgid=ine_indicadores&indOcorrCod=0008272&contexto=bd&selTab=tab2}}</ref>

The largest religion is, according to 2021 Portuguese Census, [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. The proportion of Catholics in Lisbon city proper (around 66%) is significantly higher than in the city's metropolitan area (55%).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Grande Lisboa.

===Immigration===

In 2023, around 28.62% of the city's population was constituted by foreign nationals, with Brazilians being the largest resident foreign community, followed by Chinese, Italians, French, Nepalis and Bangladeshis.

In 2019 around 17.48% of the population residing within the city's boundaries held a foreign nationality, a share that stood at 8.87% in 2014. In general, the increase in Lisbon's population is essentially attributable to the influx of people coming from abroad, who have more than tripled since 2017. Around 5.89% of Lisbon's population was constituted by Brazilians as of 2023, not including those also holding Portuguese nationality.<ref>{{Cite web |title=População estrangeira com estatuto legal de residente (N.º) por Local de residência (NUTS - 2013) e Nacionalidade; Anual |url=https://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xpid=INE&xpgid=ine_indicadores&contecto=pi&indOcorrCod=0000256&selTab=tab0}}</ref><ref name=":3" />

[[File:Rio Arauca at the oil terminal in Lisboa (2017).jpg|thumb|The oil tanker ''Rio Arauca'' at the oil terminal in Lisboa to unload crude oil]]
Lisbon's economy is based primarily on the [[tertiary sector]]. Most of the headquarters of multinationals operating in Portugal are concentrated in the [[Grande Lisboa Subregion]], especially in the [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]] municipality. The [[Lisbon metropolitan area]] is heavily industrialized, especially the south bank of the [[Tagus]] river (Rio Tejo). The lisbonite industry has very large sectors in oil, as refineries are found just across the Tagus, textile mills, shipyards and fishing.
[[File:By the river (34263121734).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Port of Lisbon]] is one of the busiest ports in Europe.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www1.eurogate.de/en/Terminals/Lisbon |title=Eurogate Lisbon |access-date=9 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110222025/http://www1.eurogate.de/en/Terminals/Lisbon |archive-date=10 November 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>]]

The country's chief [[Port of Lisbon|seaport]], featuring one of the largest and most sophisticated regional markets on the Iberian Peninsula, Lisbon and its heavily populated surroundings are also developing as an important financial centre and a dynamic technological hub. Automobile manufacturers have erected factories in the suburbs, for example, [[AutoEuropa]].

Lisbon has the largest and most developed mass media sector of Portugal and is home to several related companies ranging from leading television networks and radio stations to [[newspaper of record|major newspapers]]. Based in Lisbon, [[Euronext Lisbon]] is a [[stock exchange]] which is part of the pan-European [[Euronext]] system of stock exchanges and market infrastructure.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Euronext {{!}} LinkedIn |url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/euronext |access-date=4 November 2023 |website=www.linkedin.com |language=en}}</ref>

Before Portugal's sovereign debt crisis and an [[Portuguese economic crisis of the 2010s|EU-IMF rescue plan]], for the decade of 2010 Lisbon was expecting to receive many state-funded investments, including building a new airport, a new bridge, an expansion of the Lisbon Metro {{cvt|30|km|2}} underground, the construction of a mega-hospital (or central hospital), the creation of two lines of a [[TGV]] to join [[Madrid]], [[Porto]], [[Vigo]] and the rest of Europe, the restoration of the main part of the town (between the Marquês de Pombal roundabout and Terreiro do Paço), the creation of a large number of bike lanes, as well as modernization and renovation of various facilities.<ref>[http://www.cm-lisboa.pt/?idc=4 "Pequeno Resumo Histórico de Lisboa"] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420202721/http://www.cm-lisboa.pt/?idc=4 |date=20 April 2010 }} – Câmara Municipal de Lisboa</ref>

==Transport==

===Metro===
[[File:HPIM0530 (cropped).JPG|thumb|right|The [[Lisbon Metro]] is Portugal's oldest and largest subway system.]]
{{Main|Lisbon Metro}}

The [[Lisbon Metro]] connects the city centre with the upper and eastern districts, and also reaches some suburbs that are part of the [[Lisbon metropolitan area]], such as [[Amadora]] and [[Loures]]. It is the fastest way to get around the city and it provides a good number of interchanging stations with other types of transportation. From the [[Lisbon Airport]] station to the city centre it may take roughly 25 mins. In 2019, the [[Lisbon Metro]] served around 173 million passengers (and 475.000 daily). As of 2018, the [[Lisbon Metro]] comprises four lines, identified by individual colours (blue, yellow, green and red) and 56 stations, with a total length of 44.2&nbsp;km. Several expansion projects have been proposed, the most recent being the transformation of the Green Line into a circular line and the creation of two more stations (Santos and [[Estrela (Lisbon)|Estrela]]).

===Trams===
[[File:Lisbon tram next to Lisbon Cathedral.jpg|thumb|A [[Trams in Lisbon|Lisbon tram]] by [[Lisbon Cathedral]] and [[Santo António Church]]]]
{{Main|Trams in Lisbon}}

The [[tram]] is a traditional form of public transport in Lisbon. Introduced in 1901, electric trams were originally imported from the US,<ref>{{cite book |title=Electrical World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_FNEAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA566 |year=1900 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=566}}</ref> and thus called the ''americanos'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for "American").

Other than on the modern Line 15, the [[Trams in Lisbon|Lisbon tramway system]] still employs small (four-wheel) vehicles of a design dating from the early twentieth century. These distinctive yellow trams are one of the tourist icons of modern Lisbon, and their size is well suited to the steep hills and narrow streets of the central city.<ref>[http://www.carris.pt/index.php?area=servicos&subarea=servicos_ascensores_bica Archived copy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103194107/http://www.carris.pt/index.php?area=servicos&subarea=servicos_ascensores_bica|date=3 January 2007}} Information from Carris, Lisbon transportation company.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Luso Pages - Lisbon (Portugal) Trams |url=http://www.personal.u-net.com/~luso/listrams.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515002830/http://www.personal.u-net.com/~luso/listrams.htm |archive-date=15 May 2011 |access-date=10 March 2011}} Details of Lisbon's trams, from Luso Pages</ref>

The earliest trams can still be seen in the [[Carris Museum|Museu da Carris]] (the Lisbon Public Transport Museum).

The line has now a total length of 31 kilometers operating on 6 lines, down from a maximum of 76 kilometers for 27 lines. The slow decline of the network began with the construction of the [[Lisbon Metro]] and the expansion of the [[Carris|bus system]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pincha |first=João Pedro |date=3 April 2019 |title=Rede de eléctricos da Carris vai ligar o Jamor a Sacavém |url=https://www.publico.pt/2019/04/03/local/noticia/rede-electricos-carris-vai-ligar-jamor-sacavem-1867851 |access-date=24 August 2023 |website=PÚBLICO |language=pt}}</ref> Starting in 2017 the system has been expanded and new vehicles are being progressively added, aiming at expanding significantly the current tramway system.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Raposo |first=Frederico |date=2 November 2021 |title=Os elétricos não são só para turista ver.

[[File:Vasco_da_Gama_Bridge.jpg|thumb|Vasco da Gama bridge crosses the Tagus from [[Parque das Nações]] to [[Montijo, Portugal|Montijo]]]]
The city is connected to the far side of the Tagus by two important bridges:
* The [[25 de Abril Bridge]], inaugurated (as Ponte [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]]) on 6 August 1966, and later renamed after the date of the [[Carnation Revolution]], was the longest [[suspension bridge]] in Europe.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/suspension-bridge |title=Suspension bridge |date=15 November 2016 |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=30 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131024300/https://www.britannica.com/technology/suspension-bridge |archive-date=31 January 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The foundations for a [[Third Tagus Crossing|third bridge across the Tagus]] have already been laid, but the overall project has been postponed due to the economic crisis in Portugal and all of Europe.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |date=17 November 2022 |title=Plano Ferroviário prevê terceira travessia sobre o Tejo |url=https://www.dn.pt/sociedade/plano-ferroviario-preve-terceira-travessia-sobre-o-tejo-15362031.html |access-date=24 August 2023 |website=www.dn.pt |language=pt-PT}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Cipriano |first=Carlos |date=28 February 2023 |title=Zero quer prioridade à Terceira Travessia do Tejo exclusivamente ferroviária |url=https://www.publico.pt/2023/02/28/economia/noticia/zero-quer-prioridade-terceira-travessia-tejo-exclusivamente-ferroviaria-2040472 |access-date=24 August 2023 |website=PÚBLICO |language=pt}}</ref>
