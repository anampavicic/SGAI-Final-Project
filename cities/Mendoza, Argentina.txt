'''Mendoza''' ({{IPA|es-419|menˈdosa|lang}}), officially the '''City of Mendoza''' ({{langx|es|Ciudad de Mendoza}}), is the capital of the [[Provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]] in [[Argentina]]. It is located in the northern-central part of the province, in a region of foothills and high plains, on the eastern side of the [[Andes]]. As of the {{census-ar|2010}}, Mendoza had a population of 115,041 with a metropolitan population of 1,055,679, making [[Greater Mendoza]] the fourth largest census metropolitan area in the country.

[[National Route 7 (Argentina)|Ruta Nacional 7]], the major road running between [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], runs through Mendoza. The city is a frequent stopover for climbers on their way to [[Aconcagua]] (the highest mountain in the Western and Southern Hemispheres) and for [[adventure travel]]ers interested in [[mountaineering]], [[hiking]], [[horse riding]], [[rafting]], and other sports. In the winter, [[ski]]ers come to the city for easy access to the Andes.

Two of the main industries of the Mendoza area are [[olive oil]] production and [[Argentine wine]]. The region around Greater Mendoza is the largest wine-producing area in [[South America]]. As such, Mendoza is one of the eleven Great Wine Capitals,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.greatwinecapitals.com/ |title=The Great Wine Capitals |access-date=30 September 2019 |archive-date=7 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807002916/http://www.greatwinecapitals.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref> and the city is an emerging [[enotourism]] destination and base for exploring the region's hundreds of wineries located along the [[Argentina Wine Route]].

== History ==
[[File:Traza de la segunda fundación de Mendoza, 1562.jpg|left|thumb|Print of the second foundation of Mendoza, 1562]]
On 2 March 1561, [[Pedro del Castillo]] founded the city and named it ''Ciudad de Mendoza del Nuevo Valle de La Rioja'' after the governor of [[Chile]], Don [[García Hurtado de Mendoza, 5th Marquis of Cañete|García Hurtado de Mendoza]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.welcomeargentina.com/mendoza/history.html |title=welcomeargentina.com: Land of the good wine |access-date=7 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018111852/http://welcomeargentina.com/mendoza/history.html |archive-date=18 October 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> Before the 1560s the area was populated by tribes known as the [[Huarpe]]s and [[Puelche people|Puelche]]s. The Huarpes devised a system of irrigation that was later developed by the Spanish. This allowed for an increase in population that might not have otherwise occurred. The system is still evident today in the wide trenches ([[acequia]]s), which run along all city streets, watering the approximately 100,000 trees that line every street in Mendoza.

It is estimated that fewer than 80 Spanish settlers lived in the area before 1600, but later prosperity increased due to the use of indigenous and slave labor, and the [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] presence in the region. When nearby rivers were tapped as a source of irrigation in 1788 agricultural production increased. The extra revenues generated from this, and the ensuing additional trade with [[Buenos Aires]], [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata|Viceroyalty]] on which it depended since its creation and transfer from the [[Captaincy General of Chile]] in [[Borbon reforms|1776]], no doubt led to the creation of the state of [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]] in 1813 with [[José de San Martín]] as governor. It was from Mendoza that San Martín and other Argentinian and Chilean patriots organized the army with which they won the independence of [[Chilean Independence|Chile]] and [[Peruvian War of Independence|Peru]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=morris&book=samerican&story=hannibal |title=Morris Charles – The Hannibal of the Andes and the Freedom of Chile |access-date=7 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610043606/http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=morris&book=samerican&story=hannibal |archive-date=10 June 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
Mendoza suffered [[1861 Mendoza earthquake|a severe earthquake]] in 1861 that killed at least 5,000 people. The city was rebuilt, incorporating innovative urban designs that would better tolerate such seismic activity. Mendoza was rebuilt with large squares and wider streets and sidewalks than any other city in Argentina. Avenue [[Bartolomé Mitre]] and additional small squares are examples of that design.

Tourism, [[wine]] production, and more recently the exploitation of commodities such as oil<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://aapgbull.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/28/10/1455 |title=Baldwin Harry L. – Tupungato oil field |access-date=7 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721224740/http://aapgbull.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/28/10/1455 |archive-date=21 July 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> and uranium<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wise-uranium.org/upsam.html#SIERRAPINTADA |title=New uranium mining projects |access-date=7 November 2007 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130503142032/http://www.wise-uranium.org/upsam.html#SIERRAPINTADA |archive-date=3 May 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> ensure Mendoza's status as a key regional centre. Important suburbs such as [[Godoy Cruz, Mendoza|Godoy Cruz]], [[Guaymallén Department|Guaymallén]], [[Las Heras, Mendoza|Las Heras]] and [[Luján de Cuyo]] have in recent decades far outpaced the city proper in population. Comprising half the metro population of 212,000 in 1947, these suburbs grew to nearly seven-eighths of the total metro area of over 1,000,000 by 2015, making Mendoza the most dispersed metro area in Argentina.<ref>{{cite web |title=Encuesta Permanente de Hogares |url=http://www.indec.gov.ar/uploads/informesdeprensa/EPH_cont_3trim15.pdf |page=3 |publisher=Indec |date=23 August 2015 |access-date=2 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180818102123/https://www.indec.gov.ar/uploads/informesdeprensa/EPH_cont_3trim15.pdf |archive-date=18 August 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Culture==
Mendoza has several museums, including the Museo Cornelio Moyano, a natural history museum, and the Museo del Área Fundacional (Historical Regional Foundation Museum) on Pedro del Castillo Square. The Museo Nacional del Vino (National Wine Museum), focusing on the history of [[winemaking]] in the area, is {{convert|17|km|0|abbr=off}} southeast of Mendoza in [[Maipú, Mendoza|Maipú]]. The Casa de Fader, a [[historic house museum]], is an 1890 mansion once home to artist [[Fernando Fader]] in nearby Mayor Drummond, {{convert|14|km|0|abbr=off}} south of Mendoza. The mansion is home to many of the artist's paintings.

The Fiesta Nacional de la Vendimia (The National Grape Harvest Festival) occurs in early March each year. Part of the festivities include a [[Beauty contest|beauty pageant]], where 17 beauty queens from each [[Departments of Argentina|department]] of [[Mendoza Province]] compete, and one winner is selected by a panel of about 50 judges. The queen of Mendoza city's department does not compete and acts as host for the other queens.

In 2008, ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' listed Mendoza as one of the top 10 historic destinations in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://traveler.nationalgeographic.com/2008/11/historic-destinations-rated/list-text |title=''National Geographic'' – 2008 Ranking of Historic Places |access-date=4 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027093556/http://traveler.nationalgeographic.com/2008/11/historic-destinations-rated/list-text |archive-date=27 October 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Urban structure ==
[[File:General San Martín Park, Mendoza 01.jpg|thumb|Lake in [[General San Martín Park]]|alt=|260x260px]]The city is centred around Plaza Independencia (Independence Plaza) with Avenida [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento|Sarmiento]] running through its centre east–west, with the east side [[List of car-free places|pedestrianized]] (peatonal). Other major streets, running perpendicular to Sarmiento, include Bartolomé Mitre, San Martín, and 9 de Julio ([[Argentine Declaration of Independence|9 July]]), those running parallel include [[Christopher Columbus|Colón]], and Las Heras. Four smaller plazas, San Martín, Chile, Italia, and España, are located 2 blocks off each corner of Independence Plaza. Unique to Mendoza are the exposed stone ditches, essentially small canals, which run alongside many of the roads supplying water to the thousands of trees.
[[File:Teatro Independencia.JPG|alt=|thumb|228x228px|[[Teatro Independencia]]|left]]
Parque General San Martín ([[General San Martín Park]]) was designed by [[Carlos Thays]]. Its grounds include the [[Mendoza Zoological Park]] and a football stadium, and it is also the home of the [[Universidad Nacional de Cuyo]]. A view of the city is available from the top of [[Cerro de la Gloria]] (Mt. Glory).<ref>{{cite episode |title=Barrio la gloria by Estudio Rodante |url=https://archive.org/details/ER_Barriolagloria_Mendoza_Argentina |network=Radio Comunitaria |series=El Viento |minutes=3:02 |access-date=22 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306223456/http://www.archive.org/details/ER_Barriolagloria_Mendoza_Argentina |archive-date=6 March 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref>

One common point of interest is the [[Teatro Independencia]] ("Independence Theatre"), the premier performing arts venue in Mendoza. Supervised by the nation's Ministry of Public Works, the project was commissioned to architect Alfredo Israel, and its plans were approved in October 1923. The theatre was, as were many public works of this type in Argentina at the time, designed in a [[French Academy]] style. Its façade included a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] frontis featuring four [[Corinthian columns]] on a green [[marble]] base, a [[rococo]] [[frieze]], the provincial [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] in [[bas-relief]], and a [[Baluster|balustrade]] above. The design for the interiors was based on those prevailing in [[Italian opera]] houses, and the formal [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]] is overlooked by grand marble steps leading to the concert hall. The auditorium itself includes four tiers of balconies, and its seating capacity is 730. The theatre serves as the home of the Provincial Philharmonic Orchestra. In addition, the theatre has received international personalities such as [[Erlend Øye]] and [[John Malkovich]].

==Education==
Mendoza has a number of universities, including the major [[Universidad Nacional de Cuyo]], as well as [[Universidad de Mendoza|University of Mendoza]], a branch of Universidad Congreso, [[Aconcagua University]], UTN ([[National Technological University|Universidad Tecnologica Nacional]]) and Champagnat University.

Mendoza is a popular place to learn Spanish, and there are a number of Spanish language schools, including Intercultural, Green Fields and SIMA.<ref>{{cite web |title=SIMA: Spanish in Mendoza Argentina |url=http://spanishinmendozaargentina.greenash.net.au/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409080558/http://spanishinmendozaargentina.greenash.net.au/ |archive-date=9 April 2013 |access-date=26 March 2013 |publisher=Spanishinmendozaargentina.greenash.net.au}}</ref>

==Transportation==

Mendoza is {{cvt|1037|km|0}} from [[Buenos Aires]] (14 hours by bus) and {{cvt|380|km|0}} from [[Santiago, Chile]] (6–7 hours by bus). [[Governor Francisco Gabrielli International Airport|Gov. Francisco Gabrielli International Airport]] serves Mendoza, with flights to/from Buenos Aires taking less than 2 hours and less than 1 hour to/from Santiago.

The public transport system includes buses, the [[Trolleybuses in Mendoza|Mendoza trolleybus system]], and taxis. The trolleybuses are more comfortable than the diesel buses, but are slower, not as numerous nor is the system as extensive. In 2008, [[TransLink (Vancouver)|TransLink]] of [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, sold most of its old trolleybus fleet to Mendoza.<ref>[http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/westcoastnews/story.html?id=a92d7053-75b0-4a20-975c-74e0ceeabfbe Aged trolleys sold to Argentine city] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105033041/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/westcoastnews/story.html?id=a92d7053-75b0-4a20-975c-74e0ceeabfbe |date=5 November 2012 }}</ref>

A [[heritage railway]], El Tren del Vino (The Wine Train), is being planned which will also provide local transportation; it will run through wine-producing districts of Mendoza.{{Update inline|date=February 2023|reason=Source is significantly out of date}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.caminosdelvino.com/en/index.php?id_menu=48 |title=Mendoza Wine Train |access-date=8 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625133143/http://www.caminosdelvino.com/en/index.php?id_menu=48 |archive-date=25 June 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Metrotranvía ===
A {{convert|17|km|mi|adj=on}} [[light rail]] line, the [[Metrotranvía Mendoza]], opened for regular service in October 2012.<ref name=t&ut-dec2012>"Mendoza light rail service begins" (December 2012). ''[[Tramways & Urban Transit]]'', p. 451. [[Light Rail Transit Association|LRTA Publishing]]. {{issn|1460-8324}}.</ref> It serves the areas of [[Las Heras Department|Las Heras]], [[Godoy Cruz Department|Godoy Cruz]] and [[Maipú Department, Mendoza|Maipú]] in the [[Greater Mendoza]] conurbation, as well as the central area of Mendoza itself. The line runs from ''Avellaneda station'' in the Panquehua neighborhood of Las Heras to ''Gutiérrez'' in Maipú, stopping also at the Mendoza Railway Station at the site of the former intercity passenger train station, near the city centre. The bright red railcars, [[Siemens-Duewag U2]]s, were purchased from the [[San Diego Metropolitan Transit System]] (MTS) in 2010. They were built in 1980.

=== Transandine Railway ===
Mendoza's development was helped partly due to its position at the start of the [[Transandine Railway]] linking it to [[Los Andes, Chile|Santa Rosa de Los Andes]] in Chile. The only railway operable between Argentina and Chile, after many years of inactivity, it remains currently abandoned.<ref name="www.diariodecuyo.com.ar">[http://www.diariodecuyo.com.ar/home/new_noticia.php?noticia_id=345712 www.diariodecuyo.com.ar El tren trasandino] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531161611/http://www.diariodecuyo.com.ar/home/new_noticia.php?noticia_id=345712 |date=31 May 2011 }} Accessed 22 June 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.argentour.com/local-cgi/ToForo/index.cgi?msg=1571 Volvió el ferrocarril a Mendoza] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611035517/http://www.argentour.com/local-cgi/ToForo/index.cgi?msg=1571 |date=11 June 2011 }} {{in lang|es}}</ref><ref>[http://www.seconstruye.com/webnoticia/asp/interior.asp?id=17067 En julio se licitará tren Los Andes - Mendoza] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310140626/http://www.seconstruye.com/webnoticia/asp/interior.asp?id=17067 |date=10 March 2007 }} {{in lang|es}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090730130717/http://geocities.com/Baja/Mountain/4163/99_01.html Revisiting the Transandine Railway] Accessed 22 June 2009</ref>

The railway is a {{RailGauge|1000mm|allk=on}} line, with sections of [[Abt rack system|Abt rack]], whilst the railways it links with are both {{RailGauge|1676mm|lk=on}} [[broad gauge]]. A journey from Buenos Aires to Chile involved two [[break-of-gauge|breaks-of-gauge]], and therefore two changes of train, one at Mendoza, and the other at Santa Rosa de Los Andes.

==Wine industry==
[[File:Vineyard in Mendoza, Argentina.jpg|alt=|thumb|287x287px|Vineyards in [[Uco Valley]]]]
Argentina's [[Malbec]] wines originate from Mendoza's high-altitude wine regions of [[Luján de Cuyo|Lujan de Cuyo]] and the [[Uco Valley]]. These districts are located in the foothills of the Andes mountains between 2,800 and 5,000 feet elevation.<ref name="VA">{{cite book |last=Catena |first=Laura |title=Vino Argentino, An Insiders Guide to the Wines and Wine Country of Argentina. |publisher=[[Chronicle Books]] |year=2010 |isbn=978-0811873307 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/vinoargentinoins0000cate}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Rolland |first=Michel |title=Wines of Argentina |publisher=Mirroll |year=2006 |isbn=978-9872092634}}</ref><ref>[http://www.flyfishingpatagonia.com/mendoza_wine_malbec_wine_mendoza_malbec Wine Tours: Argentina – Mendoza] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112120211/http://www.flyfishingpatagonia.com/mendoza_wine_malbec_wine_mendoza_malbec |date=12 January 2011 }}, "Fly Fishing Patagonia"</ref><ref>[http://www.winespectator.com/webfeature/show/id/42514 Wine Tip: Malbec Madness] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150802013723/http://www.winespectator.com/webfeature/show/id/42514 |date=2 August 2015 }} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150802013723/http://www.winespectator.com/webfeature/show/id/42514 |date=2 August 2015 }}, "Wine Spectator", 12 April 2010</ref>
Vintner Nicolas Catena Zapata is considered the pioneer of high-altitude growing and was the first, in 1994, to plant a malbec vineyard at 5,000 feet above sea level in the Mendoza region. His family is also credited with making world-class wines and giving status to the wines of Argentina.<ref>[https://archive.today/20141126180056/http://www.argusleader.com/story/wineblog/2014/03/24/malbec-wines-have-rich-history-and-flavor/6841337/ Malbec wines have rich history and flavor], "Argus leader"</ref>

The subject of elevation is of much interest to the wine world because with increased altitude, the intensity of the sunlight increases. The role of this increased light intensity is currently being investigated by Catena Zapata's research and development department headed up by Laura Catena, Alejandro Vigil and Fernando Buscema.

==In media==
''[[Seven Years in Tibet (1997 film)|Seven Years in Tibet]]'', directed by French director [[Jean-Jacques Annaud]] and starring [[Brad Pitt]], was shot in and around Mendoza. Several dozens of sets were built, ranging from a {{convert|220|yd|m|adj=on}} long recreation of the [[Tibet]]an capital city of [[Lhasa]] (built in the foothills of the Andes), to a {{convert|9000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} recreation of the Hall of Good Deeds in the [[Potala]], the ancient palace of the [[Dalai Lama]] (built in an abandoned garlic warehouse outside the city).

Mendoza appears as the penultimate level of the 2021 video game [[Hitman 3|''Hitman 3'']]. It contains hints of Argentine culture, such as [[Mate (drink)|mate]], [[tango]], and [[Winemaking|wine production]].

==Climate==
Mendoza's climate is characterised as an [[arid climate|arid]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWk'');<ref>{{cite journal |author=M. Kottek |author2=J. Grieser |author3=C. Beck |author4=B.
