'''Berezniki''' ({{langx|ru|Березники́}}) is the [[List of cities and towns in Russia by population|second-largest]] [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] in [[Perm Krai]], [[Russia]]. The city is located on the banks of the [[Kama (river)|Kama River]], in the [[Ural Mountains]] with a population of 135,533 as of 2023.

== Etymology ==
The name Berezniki is derived from a [[birch]] forest originally situated in the city's location.

== History ==
The first Russian settlements in the city appeared in the 16th - 17th century on the basis of salt mines.

It was founded in 1873.<ref name="gr">{{cite book|title=Энциклопедия Города России|year=2003|publisher=Большая Российская Энциклопедия|location=Moscow|isbn=5-7107-7399-9|page=46}}</ref> City status was granted to it in 1932<ref name="gr" /> as its [[Industrial sector|industry]] was rapidly expanding under [[Joseph Stalin]].

== Administrative and municipal status ==
Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is incorporated as the [[city of federal subject significance|city of krai significance]] of Berezniki—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Perm Krai|districts]].<ref name="Ref127">Law #416-67</ref> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the city of krai significance of Berezniki is incorporated as Berezniki Urban Okrug.<ref name="Ref840">Law #1983-434</ref>

== Economy ==
After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the city's population dropped due to increased unemployment. Nevertheless, the city was able to keep its main industries on track. Large [[chemical plant]]s such as [[titanium]] and [[sodium]] factories as well as several huge [[potassium]], [[magnesium]] and [[potash]] mines are operational in Berezniki.

The potash mine, owned by [[Uralkali]], was the basis of the fortune of [[Dmitry Rybolovlev]] who sold his interest in 2010 to [[Suleyman Kerimov]]. Mine supports in the huge underground mine, about 1,000 feet (~300 metres) beneath the city, consist of soluble salt which is being dissolved by water flooding into the mine. The city, a former Soviet-era labor camp, was built near the work site, over the mine. Several [[sinkhole]]s, some huge, have opened within the city. The situation requires round-the-clock monitoring. The problem is believed to be limited to a small part of the mine which was not filled properly and is limited in its future impact, but the relocation of the city is under consideration.<ref name = "NYTjournal" >[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/11/world/europe/russian-city-on-watch-against-being-sucked-into-the-earth.html?_r=1 "A Russian City Always on the Watch Against Being Sucked Into the Earth"] article by Andrew E. Kramer in ''[[The New York Times]]'' April 10, 2012</ref> The largest sinkhole, locally dubbed, "The Grandfather" by 2012, was 340 yards (~310 metres) wide, 430 yards (~390 metres) long, and 780 feet (~240 metres) deep.<ref name = "NYTjournal" /> When it opened in 2007<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://englishrussia.com/2007/10/29/a-giant-sinkhole/|title=A Giant Sinkhole|date=October 29, 2007|website=English Russia}}</ref> the hole was initially 80 m long, 40 m wide and 200 m deep.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/2007-11-02-another-sinkhole-threatens-russia/|title=2007-11-02 - Another sinkhole threatens Russia in Berezniki, Russian Federation|date=December 17, 2007|website=Virtual Globetrotting}}</ref> The sinkhole was expected to expand, and destroy part of the only rail line which leads to and from the [[potash]] mines, and, being that Berezniki produces around 10% of the world's potash, this would lead global demand towards [[Canada]], potentially damaging the local economy. Nobody was injured when the sinkhole appeared.

== Culture ==
Berezniki has a theatre and a museum of regional history.

Every year from July 17 to the 20th the town celebrates its [[mosquito]]es.  They have music, dancing and a "most delicious girl" competition.  In the competition, the girls stand for 20 minutes in their shorts and vests, and the one who receives the most bites wins.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-33525015|title=Russia: Mosquitoes honoured at annual festival|work=BBC News |date=July 14, 2015}}</ref>
