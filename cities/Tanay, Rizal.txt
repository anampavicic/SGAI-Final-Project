'''Tanay''', officially the '''Municipality of Tanay''' ({{lang-fil|Bayan ng Tanay}} {{IPA|tl|tɐˈnaɪ|IPA}}), is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 139,420 people.{{PH census|current}}

Tanay is located {{convert|37|km}} from [[Antipolo]] and {{convert|54|km}} from [[Manila]]. It contains portions of the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] Mountains and is bordered by [[Antipolo]] in the north-west, [[Baras, Rizal|Baras]], [[Morong, Rizal|Morong]] and [[Teresa, Rizal|Teresa]] in the west, [[General Nakar]] ([[Quezon]] Province) in the east, and [[Pililla, Rizal|Pililla]], [[Santa Maria, Laguna|Santa Maria]] ([[Laguna province]]) as well as the lake [[Laguna de Bay]] in the south.

It is the epicenter of the Tanay Tagalog dialect, which has the deepest modern Tagalog words in the Tagalog language and is the only endangered Tagalog dialect.

== History ==
[[File:Tanay Church jmvb.jpg|left|thumb|San Ildefonso de Toledo Church.]]
[[File:Rizal Shrine adjacent to the San Ildefonso de Toledo Church.jpg|thumb|left|Rizal Shrine near the San Ildefonso de Toledo Church.]]
Tanay was settled by early Austronesian people.  Shortly after the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|conquest and subjugation]] of Manila by the Spaniards and the surrounding lake areas by [[Juan de Salcedo]] in 1570–1574, Franciscan missionaries arrived to Christianize the inhabitants of what is now the Morong-Pililla area.  In 1583, both Morong and Pililla were created as separate towns with Tanay forming part of Pililla.

Tanay was founded as a separate ''pueblo'' (town) in 1606 under the name "Monte de Tan-ay".  In 1620, administration was moved to San Antonio (now called Inalsan or Pantay) and Tandang Kutyo.  In 1638, the town was burned during an uprising of Chinese living in the area, and the town was rebuilt in 1640 at the present day location.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tanay.gov.ph/profile.htm |title=Municipality of Tanay, Its Profile<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322220748/http://www.tanay.gov.ph/profile.htm |archive-date=2007-03-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1747, the town of Tanay consisted of only eight ''barangays'', namely Nuestra Senora del Rosario, Sa Josep, San Ildefonso de Tanay, San Francisco de Maytubig, San Pedro de Alcantara, San Lucas y San Antonio, San Apostol, and San Agustin de Balugbog.

In 1853, a new political subdivision was formed. The town of Tanay together with Morong, Baras, Pililla, Angono, Binangonan and Jalajala form the Province of La Laguna, with the capital at Morong. This district was later changed to Distrito Politico-Militar de Morong after four years.

Tanay became a Municipality in 1894 as an effect of the Spanish [[Maura Law]]. The first election of Public Office took place in 1895–1898 and 1898–1900 under the [[Revolutionary Government of the Philippines]].

Tanay members of the Katipunan fought valiantly during the Revolution against Spain.  The town was the headquarters of the second military area of the Philippine Revolutionary Government under [[General Emilio Aguinaldo]]. And for a brief period between 1899 and 1900, Tanay served as the capital of the then Morong Province after [[Philippine–American War]] broke out and the American forces invaded the lake towns and captured [[Antipolo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tanay.gov.ph/profile.htm#history |title=Municipality of Tanay, Its Profile<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322220748/http://www.tanay.gov.ph/profile.htm#history#history |archive-date=2007-03-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1900–1901, Tanay as was under the Government appointed by the [[Military of the United States|American Military]] under [[Taft Commission]]. From 1903 to 1934 the town leadership was under the [[United States of America|American]] rule then in 1934 Tanay was under the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] as the [[Tydings–McDuffie Act]] was approved on March 24, 1934, until the Philippines fell to the hands of the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] during the Second World War in 1942.

In 1942–1945 the Mountains of Tanay served as the [[Guerrilla warfare|Guerrilla]] base for 'Marking's Fil-American Guerrillas, beginning the Liberation of Tanay in March 1945 a very decorated by the Filipino soldiers of the [[4th Infantry Division (Philippines)|4th]] and 42nd Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, 4th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary and the recognized guerrillas against the Japanese occupation forces during World War II. General Agustin Marking is buried in a private cemetery by the road overlooking his son's farm in Sampaloc.

On June 19, 1959, Republic Act No. 2336, also known as "An Act Establishing a Summer Resort in Sampaloc, Municipality of Tanay, Province of Rizal" was approved whereas there is hereby established a summer resort in Sampaloc. The Commission on Parks and Wildlife shall issue such rules and regulations for the establishment of such resort is taken place.

In October 2003, deposed Philippine president [[Joseph Estrada]] was transferred to a rest home in Sampaloc, a mountain barangay. He remained under [[house arrest]] until he was given executive [[clemency]] by [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]].

During the [[Typhoon Ketsana]] (Ondoy) on September 26, 2009, Tanay was one of the hardest hit towns due to the rising of Laguna Lake and the flooding of Tanay River.
