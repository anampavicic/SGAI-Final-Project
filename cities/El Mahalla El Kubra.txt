'''El Mahalla El Kubra''' ({{langx|ar|المحلة الكبرى}}, {{IPA|arz|elmæˈħællæ lˈkobɾɑ|lang}}, {{Langx|cop|ϯϣⲁⲓⲣⲓ}}, {{IPA-cop|təʃˈaɪrə|lang}}) – commonly shortened to ''{{transl|arz|El Maḥalla}}'' – is the largest city of the [[Gharbia Governorate]] and in the Nile Delta, with a population of 535,278 as of 2012. It is a large industrial and agricultural city in [[Egypt]], located in the middle of the [[Nile Delta]] on the western bank of the [[Damietta]] Branch tributary. The city is known for its [[textile]] industry, and hosts the [[Misr Spinning and Weaving Company]] which employs around 27,000 people.

==Etymology==
El Mahalla El Kubra consists of two words: [[mahallah|El Mahalla]] in Arabic means "''district''" or "''encampment",'' El Kubra means ''"great"''. Hence the title collectively means "''The Great Encampment''".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Al-Mahallah-al-Kubra|title=Al-Maḥallah al-Kubrā|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|access-date=2018-06-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623171010/https://www.britannica.com/place/Al-Mahallah-al-Kubra|archive-date=2018-06-23|url-status=live}}</ref> The name is probably a rough translation of its Coptic Egyptian equivalent ti-Šairi ({{Langx|cop|ϯϣⲁⲓⲣⲓ|lit=cohabitation, residence}}'').''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://coptot.manuscriptroom.com/crum-coptic-dictionary/?docID=800000&pageID=584|title=Crum Coptic Dictionary - CoptOT Public|website=coptot.manuscriptroom.com|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref>

==History==
In the Chronicle of [[John of Nikiû|John of Nikiu]] el-Mahalla is also given a name '''Didouseya<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Maspero |first=Jean |last2=Wiet |first2=Gaston |date=1919 |title=Matériaux pour servir à la géographie de l'Égypte |journal=MIFAO |volume=36 |pages=164}}</ref>''', which could be equated with ''Theodosiou'' ({{Langx|cop|ⲑⲉⲟⲇⲱⲥⲓⲟⲩ}}). It is given as ''Theodosiou Nixis'' ({{Langx|cop|ⲑⲉⲟⲇⲱⲥⲓⲟⲩ ⲛⲓⲝⲓⲥ}}) by [[Georges Daressy|Daressy]], but it's rather an equation of two nearby towns (Theodosiou and Nixis, modern Nawasa ({{Langx|ar|نَوَسا}})), common for Coptic Scalae, rather than a compound name.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Daressy |first=G. |date=1894 |title=Les Grandes Villes d'Égypte a l'Époque Copte |journal=Revue Archéologique |volume=25 |pages=196–215 |issn=0035-0737 |jstor=41729502}}</ref> The modern area Suq al-Laban is located on Didouseya Hill.<ref>{{Cite web |title=سوق اللبن |url=https://www.marefa.org/%D8%B3%D9%88%D9%82_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%86 |access-date=2023-04-19 |website=المعرفة |language=ar}}</ref>

The city was also known as Mahalla Daqla ({{Langx|ar|محلة دقلا}}), where second word could be a corruption of [[Dakahlia Governorate|Dakahla]].<ref name=":0" />

An ancient village ''Sandafa'' ({{Langx|ar|صندفا}}, {{Langx|cop|ⲥⲉⲛⲧⲉϥⲉ}}) was located south of el-Mahalla. North of it was a village ''Hureyn Baharmis'' ({{Langx|ar|هورين بهرمس}}), the name of which suggests that it was an ancient river-port ({{Langx|cop|ⲡϩⲟⲣⲙⲟⲥ|lit=the port|translit=phormos}}),<ref name=":02">{{Cite web |last=Peust |first=Carsten |title=Die Toponyme vorarabischen Ursprungs im modernen Ägypten |url=http://www.peust.de/ortsnamen_original.pdf |page=17}}</ref> whose namesake is mentioned in [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] sources ({{Langx|egy|Ḥwrn.t}}<ref name=":023">{{Cite web |last=Peust |first=Carsten |title=Die Toponyme vorarabischen Ursprungs im modernen Ägypten |url=http://www.peust.de/ortsnamen_original.pdf |page=17}}</ref>). In [[1844]] the city absorbed both villages.<ref>{{Cite web |title=الأرشيف المصرى للحياة والمأثورات الشعبية |url=http://www.nfa-eg.org/Search/Place_Details.aspx?ID=179 |access-date=2023-04-19 |website=www.nfa-eg.org}}</ref>

El Mahalla El Kubra was designated as the capital of [[Gharbia Governorate]] in 1320 by [[An-Nasir Muhammad|Ibn Qalawun]], before it was relocated to [[Tanta]] in 1836.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}
