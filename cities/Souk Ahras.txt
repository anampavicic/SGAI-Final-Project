'''Souk Ahras''' ({{langx|ar|سوق أهراس}}) is a [[municipalities of Algeria|municipality]] in [[Algeria]]. It is the capital of [[Souk Ahras Province]]. The [[Numidia]]n city of [[Thagaste]] (or Tagaste), on whose ruins Souk Ahras was built, was the birthplace of [[Augustine of Hippo]] and a center of [[Berber people|Berber]] culture.<ref>"A Berber, born in 354 at Thagaste (now Souk-Ahras) in Africa...", [[Fernand Braudel]], ''A history of civilizations (1963)'', Penguin Books, 1995, p.335</ref><ref>"...he grew up in an area which was a center of [[Berber people|Berber]] culture.", Augustinian studies, Volumes 7–8, [[Villanova University]] Press, 1976, p.134</ref>

==Etymology==
The name derives from the Arabic word ''[[souk]]'' which means "market", and the Chaoui Berber word ''ahra'' (plural ''ahras'') which means "[[lion]]", in reference to the [[Barbary lion]]s which existed in the neighboring forests until their extinction in 1930; hence ''Souk Ahras'' means "market of lions" (see also [[Oran]] (''Wahran'') and [[Tahert]] for names with a related etymology).

The old name of the Numidian city of Thagaste derives from the Berber Thagoust, which means ''the bag'', given that the site of the town is located at the foot of a mountain surrounded by three peaks in the form of a bag containing the city. Subsequently, when the [[Arabic]] language appeared in the region it was called ''Soukara''. In other sources it is cited as the Palace of the African, according to [[Al-Masudi]].

==History==

=== Prehistory ===
The town of Souk Ahras, as its region, was home to people of the [[Aterian]] culture from the end of the [[Middle Palaeolithic]] to the early upper [[Palaeolithic]] Ages. After the Aterian, Souk Ahras was inhabited by people of the [[Capsian]] culture. Many stone tools dating to this period have been discovered. Stemmed arrows were found on the site of present-day Souk Ahras, but also in [[Tiffech]] and [[Taoura]], not far from it.

=== Antiquity ===
It was the birthplace of [[Augustine of Hippo]] (born 13 November 354 CE), son of [[Saint Monica|Saint Monica of Hippo]], who later became the Bishop of Hippo and Saint Augustine.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Thagaste}}</ref> Souk Ahras (Thagaste) has played an important role in the political and cultural history of the region because of its strategic position at the crossroads of [[Numidia|Numide]], Ancient Roman, and [[Berber people|Berber]] civilizations. It was the location of military fortifications ([[Madaure]], [[Tiffech]], [[Khemissa]], etc.) and urban centers.

====[[Thagaste]]====
Thagaste was a town of Numidia in [[Roman North Africa]], on the banks of the [[Oued Hamise]] river. [[Augustine of Hippo]] was born here.
The [[municipium|Roman city]] is identified with [[ruins]] of  Tajilt  near Souk Ahras, Algeria.

The Numidian city of Thagaste or Tagaste, on whose ruins Souk Ahras was built, was situated in the north-eastern highlands of [[Numidia]]. It was about {{convert|60|mi|km|-1|abbr=in|order=flip}} from [[Hippo Regius]], (present day [[Annaba (city)|Annaba]]), {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=in|order=flip}} southwest of [[Khamissa|Thubursicum]] (present day Khamissa), and about {{convert|150|mi|km|abbr=in|order=flip}} from [[Carthage]] (on the coast of present-day [[Tunisia]]).

Thagaste became a [[Roman Republic|Roman]] ''[[municipium]]''.<ref>A ''municipium'' was an existing city on which the citizenship had been conferred, while a colony was a new foundation or a community to which Roman settlers had been added</ref> The city was mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]]. As a ''municipium'', Thagaste was not settled by Roman Italian immigrants, but was inhabited by Romanized native [[Berbers]].<ref>Nacéra Benseddik, ''Thagaste. Souk Ahras, ville natale de saint Augustin'', Ed. Inas, Alger, 2005, p.25</ref>

===Modern era===
In 1830 Souk Ahras became a colonial settlement of [[French Algeria]] (1830–1962). In the late 19th century connection via the [[National Company for Rail Transport|Algerian Railway]], and in the 20th century [[iron ore]] and [[phosphate]] mining brought some modern significance and prosperity to the town.

During the [[Algerian War|Algerian War of Independence]] (1954–1962), Souk Ahras housed the Ouled Bechiah Mounts as an autonomous military base of the [[National Liberation Army (Algeria)|Army of National Liberation (ALN)]], called "Basis of the East".

== Geography ==

=== Relief and hydrography ===
The town of Souk Ahras is located in a basin surrounded by wooded mountains as the Djebel Beni Salah or Djebel Ouled Moumen.

Souk Ahras is crossed by a major North African river, the [[Medjerda]].

Three dams exist in the region of Souk Ahras, ''that of Ain-Edalia'' supplies the town of Souk Ahras and its region with {{convert|76|e6m3|abbr=off}}. The dams of ''Oued Charef'' and ''Djedra'', provide a capacity of {{convert|153|and|35|e6m3|abbr=off}}, respectively. Dam Djedra is intended to supply the town of Souk Ahras with a quantity of {{convert|12|and|35|e6m3|abbr=off}} of potable water, while {{convert|2|e6m3|abbr=off}} will be pumped for irrigation.
