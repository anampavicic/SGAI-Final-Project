Summers are considerably milder than in other parts of [[Honshu]] because the city is very close to the open sea, while winters if distinctly cold are much less snowy than in [[Aomori, Aomori|Aomori city]] or [[Sapporo]] or [[Wakkanai, Hokkaidō|Wakkanai]], although snowfall is higher than in [[Kushiro, Hokkaidō|Kushiro]].

==History==
The area around Hachinohe has been occupied since prehistoric times, and was a major population center for the [[Emishi]] people. Numerous [[Jōmon period]] remains have been discovered within the borders of Hachinohe. The area was nominally under control of the [[Northern Fujiwara]] in the [[Heian period]], and became part of the holdings granted to the [[Nanbu clan]] after the defeat of the North Fujiwara by [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] in the [[Kamakura period]]. The Nanbu established numerous horse ranches, accompanied by numbered fortified settlements. During the [[Edo period]], it was initially part of [[Morioka Domain]], but in 1664 the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] authorized the creation of a separate 20,000 ''[[koku]]'' [[Hachinohe Domain]] for a junior line of the Nanbu clan. The town prospered as a [[castle town]] centered on [[Hachinohe Castle]], and served as a small commercial centre and port for the fishing grounds off southeastern [[Hokkaido]]. Today, the port still serves the fishing industry and a number of international cargo vessels.

After the [[Meiji Restoration]], Hachinohe Domain was abolished, and replaced by Hachinohe Prefecture, which was subsequently merged into [[Aomori Prefecture]]. Initially, there was a debate as to whether the capital of newly formed Aomori Prefecture should be at Hachinohe or [[Hirosaki, Aomori|Hirosaki]]; however, due to strong rivalry between the former Nanbu domain and former [[Hirosaki Domain|Tsugaru Domain]], the [[Meiji government]] decided to build a new town called Aomori in a central location, and to designate it as the capital of the prefecture.

Per the [[Meiji period]] establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889, the town of Hachinohe was created within [[Sannohe District, Aomori|Sannohe District]]. In 1901, it merged with neighboring Chōja, and on May 1, 1929, with neighboring Konakano, Minato and Same villages to form the city of Hachinohe. The city further expanded by annexing the village of Shimonaganawashiro in 1942, Korekawa in 1954, Ichikawa, Kaminaganawashiro, Tachi and Toyosaki in 1955 and Odate in 1958.

On March 31, 2005, the village of [[Nangō, Aomori|Nangō]] (from [[Sannohe District, Aomori|Sannohe District]]) was also merged into Hachinohe.

During the [[American occupation of Japan]] following [[World War II]], a [[United States Army]] base, [[JGSDF Camp Hachinohe|Camp Haugen]], was located in Hachinohe, and was the home of the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|Seventh Division]]. An [[Armed Forces Radio Service]] radio station was located on the base; it was known as AFRS Hachinohe. In 1950, after the [[North Korea]]n invasion of [[South Korea]], troops from Camp Haugen left for Korea. AFRS Hachinohe altered its broadcasts to include coverage of South Korea so Americans could benefit from its news and entertainment programs. With the final withdrawal of American forces from Hachinohe in 1956, the base was turned over to the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force]] and was officially re-designated JGSDF Camp Hachinohe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedropzone.org/units/511thHISTORY.html|title=511th History|website=www.thedropzone.org}}</ref>

In March 2011, the city was one of those hit by the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 Japanese tsunami]]. The tsunami tossed many huge fishing boats ashore and heavily damaged the port area.  About 100 homes were destroyed.<ref>Flack, T. D., "[http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/earthquake-disaster-in-japan/misawa-residents-pull-clean-up-duty-at-nearby-fishing-port-1.138013 Misawa residents pull clean-up duty at nearby fishing port]", [[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|''Stars and Stripes'']], 17 March 2011, retrieved 18 March 2011.</ref>  Divers from the [[United States Navy]] ship [[USNS Safeguard (T-ARS-50)|''Safeguard'']] joined with Japanese workers to help clear the port to facilitate the delivery of relief supplies via the city.<ref>Johnson, Christopher, "[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/mar/27/us-helps-clear-vital-japan-harbor/ U.S. Helps Clear Vital Japan Harbor]", ''[[Washington Times]]'', 27 March 2011, retrieved 30 March 2011.</ref>

On January 1, 2017, Hachinohe was given core city status,<ref>[http://www.soumu.go.jp/cyukaku/index.html Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications of Japan, official home page]{{in lang|ja}}</ref> with increased local autonomy.

==Government==
Hachinohe has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city legislature of 32 members. Hachinohe contributes eight members to the Aomori Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of [[Aomori 2nd district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Hachinohe is the largest city in eastern Aomori Prefecture, and serves as the regional industrial and commercial center. [[Commercial fishing]] still plays a major role in the local economy, with Hachinohe port having one of the largest volumes of landed fish in Japan. However, since its designation as a new industrial city in 1964, Hachinohe has developed a large coastal industrial belt with a diverse range of chemical, steel, cement and fertilizer products. Major industrial parks include the Hachinohe High Tech Park and Hachinohe North-Interchange Industrial Complex. The [[Hachinohe Thermal Power Station]], an LNG-fired power plant operated by [[Tohoku Electric]] is located in the city. Hachinohe Port is a major international port for northern Japan.

===Local festivals===
*'''Emburi''' is a citywide [[matsuri|festival]] which is also celebrated in nearby towns. The object of the festival is to pray for a bountiful harvest in the coming year. It originated as a dance with an agricultural tool (the ''eburi''; ''enburi'' is a local pronunciation), which was used to teach people how to cultivate the land. Nowadays it is a parade of 15-20 people, with 3-5 dancers and a singer accompanied by wooden flutes, drums and bells. The festival takes place February 17–20, and marks the official end of the long, harsh winter.
*'''[[Hachinohe Sansha Taisai]]''' is another citywide festival and is considered to be the main festival of the town. It is also billed as "Japan's Biggest Float Festival". ''Sansha'' means "three shrines" and ''Taisai'' means "festival": It is held by three Shinto shrines: Ogami Jinja, Shinra Jinja, and Shinmei-gu. Floats proceed through the main streets of the city, accompanied by people with drums, flutes and loud calls. 27 different floats are used, and they are proudly constructed and flourished by the members of various organizations, such as schools and the city hall. The floats are also accompanied by men in [[samurai]] costumes on horseback, and tiger dancers. On the second and third days of the festival, a traditional game of a sport similar to polo is held at the stables of Shinra Shrine. This sport (加賀美流騎馬打毬 ''Kaga Biryū Kiba Dakyū'') is officially an "intangible cultural asset" of Aomori Prefecture. Sansha Taisai takes place from July 31 to August 4 every year.
