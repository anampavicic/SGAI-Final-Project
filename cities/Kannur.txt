'''Kannur''' ({{IPA-ml|kɐɳːuːr|lang|Kannur_R1.ogg}}), formerly known in English as '''Cannanore''', is a [[Cities in India|city]] and a [[Municipal corporation (India)|municipal corporation]] in the state of [[Kerala]], [[India]]. It is the administrative headquarters of the [[Kannur district]] and situated {{convert|274|km}} north of the major port city and commercial hub [[Kochi]] and {{convert|137|km}} south of the major port city and a commercial hub, [[Mangalore]]. During the period of [[British Raj|British colonial rule in India]], when Kannur was a part of the [[Malabar District]] (Madras Presidency), the city was known as Cannanore.

Kannur was the headquarters of [[Kolathunadu]], one of the four most important dynasties on the [[Malabar Coast]], along with the [[Zamorin of Calicut]], [[Kingdom of Cochin]] and [[Kingdom of Quilon]].

===Pre-history and Ancient era===
The earliest evidence of human habitation in the region are rock-cut caves and megalithic burial sites of the [[Neolithic]] age. The [[Taliparamba]]-Kannur-[[Thalassery]] area abounds in rock-cut caves, [[dolmen]]s, burial stone circles and [[menhir]]s, all of [[megalith]]. Kannur District was the seat of powerful kingdom based at [[Ezhimala]] in the [[Sangam period]] (1st–5th century CE). The ancient port of ''Naura'', which is mentioned in the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' as a port somewhere north of [[Muziris]] is identified with Kannur.<ref name="Ente_Kannur">{{cite book|author=Menon, A. Sreedhara |title=A Survey of Kerala History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FVsw35oEBv4C|year=2007|publisher=DC Books|isbn=9788126415786|via=Google Books}}</ref> [[Pliny the Elder]] (1st century CE) states that the port of ''[[Tyndis]]'' was located at the northwestern border of ''Keprobotos'' ([[Chera dynasty]]).<ref name=":2">{{cite journal|author1=Gurukkal, R.|author2=Whittaker, D. |year=2001|title=In search of Muziris|journal=Journal of Roman Archaeology|volume=14 |number=14|pages=334–350|doi=10.1017/S1047759400019978 |s2cid=164778915 }}</ref> The region, which lies north of the port at ''Tyndis'', was ruled by the kingdom of [[Ezhimala]] during the [[Sangam period]].<ref>{{cite book|author=A. Shreedhara Menon|title=A Survey of Kerala History}}</ref>

According to the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'', a region known as ''[[Limyrike]]'' began at ''Naura'' and ''[[Tyndis]]''. However the [[Ptolemy]] mentions only ''[[Tyndis]]'' as the ''[[Limyrike]]'''s starting point. The region probably ended at [[Kanyakumari]]; it thus roughly corresponds to the present-day [[Malabar Coast]]. The value of [[Rome]]'s annual trade with the region was estimated at around 50,000,000 [[sesterces]].<ref>According to [[Pliny the Elder]], goods from India were sold in the Empire at 100 times their original purchase price.

The kingdom of [[Ezhimala]] had jurisdiction over two ''Nadu''s – The coastal ''Poozhinadu'' and the hilly eastern ''Karkanadu''. According to the works of [[Sangam literature]], ''Poozhinadu'' consisted much of the coastal belt between [[Mangalore]] and [[Kozhikode]].<ref name="Census_Handbook">{{Cite book|title=District Census Handbook, Kasaragod (2011)|publisher=Directorate of Census Operation, Kerala|location=Thiruvananthapuram|pages=9|url=https://censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/3201_PART_B_KASARAGOD.pdf}}</ref> ''Karkanadu'' consisted of [[Wayanad]]-[[Gudalur, Nilgiris|Gudalur]] hilly region with parts of [[Kodagu]] (Coorg).<ref name="wnd">{{cite book

===Early Middle Ages===
According to [[Mappila|Kerala Muslim]] tradition, Kannur along with surrounding [[Madayi]] and [[Dharmadom]] were home to three of the [[Islam in India|oldest mosques]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. According to the [[Legend of Cheraman Perumals]], the first Indian mosque was built in 624 AD at Kodungallur with the mandate of the last the ruler (the Cheraman Perumal) of [[Chera dynasty]], who left from [[Dharmadom]] to [[Mecca]] and converted to [[Islam]] during the lifetime of [[Muhammad]] (c.&nbsp;570–632).<ref>{{cite book |author=Jonathan Goldstein |title=The Jews of China |publisher=M.

Kannur was an important trading center in the 12th century, with active business connections with [[Persia]] and [[Arabia]]. The port at [[Kozhikode]] held the superior economic and political position in medieval Kerala coast, while Kannur, [[Kollam]], and [[Kochi]], were commercially important secondary ports, where the traders from various parts of the world would gather.<ref name="Malekandathil">''The Portuguese, Indian Ocean and European Bridgeheads 1500–1800''.

===Era of European influences===
Kannur served as the [[Presidency armies|East India Company military]] headquarters on India's west coast until 1887.<ref name="EB1911"/> The modern town is referred to as Kannur Town. Kannur, as a district and surrounding areas, were mostly ruled by the famous [[Kolathiri Rajas]]. When the state of Kerala was formed the district took the name Kannur since the administrative offices were established here. Before that, Kannur was the headquarters of [[Chirakkal, Kannur|Chirakkal]] [[taluk]] of [[Malabar District]] in the [[Madras Presidency]]. During the period of [[Company rule in India]], the [[East India Company]] preferred Madras and Cochin as their major stations and Kannur started to lose its old glory. The people of Kannur are still waiting for their old glory to get back and they feel they are being sidelined because the state administration is located the exact opposite side of the state. Part of the original city of Kannur was under Kerala's only Muslim Royalty called the Arakkal and this area is still known as city.

The Portuguese explorer [[Vasco da Gama]] arrived at [[Kappad]] [[Kozhikode]] in 1498 during the [[Age of Discovery]], thus opening a direct sea route from Europe to South Asia.<ref>DC Books, Kottayam (2007), A. Sreedhara Menon, A Survey of Kerala History</ref> In 1501 a Portuguese factory was planted here by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], and in 1502 da Gama made a treaty with the Raja.<ref name="EB1911"/> The [[St. Angelo Fort]] at Kannur was built in 1505 by Dom [[Francisco de Almeida]], the first Portuguese Viceroy of India. The Dutch captured the fort from the Portuguese in 1663. They modernised the fort and built the bastions Hollandia, Zeelandia, and Frieslandia that are the major features of the present structure. The original Portuguese fort was pulled down later. A painting of this fort and the fishing ferry behind it can be seen in the [[Rijksmuseum]] Amsterdam. The Dutch sold the fort to king Ali Raja of Arakkal in 1772.

During the 17th century, Kannur was the capital city of the only [[Muslim]] Sultanate in Kerala, known as [[Arakkal]], who also ruled the [[Laccadive Islands]] in addition to the city of Kannur.<ref name=anathapuri>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ananthapuri.com/kerala-history.asp?page=muslim|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605222957/http://ananthapuri.com/kerala-history.asp?page=muslim|url-status=dead|title=Arakkal royal family|archivedate=5 June 2012}}</ref> [[Arakkal Kingdom]] and [[Chirakkal Raja|Chirakkal kingdom]] were two vassal kingdoms based in the city of Kannur. The island of [[Dharmadom]] near Kannur, along with [[Thalassery]], was ceded to the [[East India Company]] as early as 1734, which were claimed by all of the [[Kolathiri|''Kolattu Rajas'']], [[Kingdom of Kottayam|''Kottayam Rajas'']], ''[[Mannanar]]''<ref>{{cite book|last=P.J Rajendran|title=Kshethravinjanakosam|year=2000|publisher= D.C.Books publishing, Google books|page=103|isbn=9788126402540}}</ref> and [[Arakkal kingdom|''Arakkal Bibi'']] in the late medieval period, where the British initiated a factory and English settlement following the [[cession]].<ref name="Eng_cession">{{cite book

}}</ref><ref name="Logan"/> Then the East India Company [[Capture of Cannanore|captured the fort Kannur]] in 1790 and used it as one of their major military stations on the [[Malabar Coast]]. During the period of [[British Raj|British colonial rule]], Kannur was part of the [[Madras]] province in the [[Malabar District|Malabar]] District.

In 1761, the British captured [[Mahé, India|Mahé]], and the settlement was handed over to the ruler of [[Kadathanadu]].<ref name="Mahé"/> The British restored [[Mahé, India|Mahé]] to the French as a part of the 1763 Treaty of Paris.<ref name="Mahé"/> In 1779, the Anglo-French war broke out, resulting in the French loss of [[Mahé, India|Mahé]].<ref name="Mahé"/> In 1783, the British agreed to restore to the French their settlements in India, and [[Mahé, India|Mahé]] was handed over to the French in 1785.<ref name="Mahé">{{cite web|url=http://mahe.gov.in/mws/leftmenupages/history.html|title=History of Mahé|access-date=19 April 2021|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230232052/http://mahe.gov.in/mws/leftmenupages/history.html|archive-date=30 December 2013}}</ref>

Initially the British had to suffer local resistance against their rule under the leadership of [[Pazhassi Raja|Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja]], who had popular support in [[Thalassery]]-[[Wayanad]] region.<ref name="Ente_Kannur"/> The guerrilla war launched by [[Pazhassi Raja]], the ruler of Kottayam province, against the East India Company had a huge impact on the history of Kannur. Changes in the socio-economic and political sectors in Kerala during the initial decades of the 20th century created conditions congenial for the growth of the Communist Party. Extension of English education initiated by Christian missionaries in 1906 and later carried forward by government, rebellion for wearing a cloth to cover upper parts of body, installing an idol at Aruvippuram in 1888, Malayali Memorial in 1891, establishment of SNDP Yogam in 1903, activities, struggles etc. became factors helpful to accelerate changes in Kerala society during a short time. These movements eventually coalesced into the [[Indian independence movement]].

Very soon, ideas about socialism and [[Soviet Revolution]] reached Kerala. Such ideas got propagated in Kerala through the works of [[Swadeshabhimani Ramakrishna Pillai]], [[Sahodaran Ayyappan]], [[P. Kesavadev]] and others. By the beginning of the 1930s, some other useful developments were taking place. Important among them was Nivarthana Agitation in Travancore. That was the demand of people suppressed so far as untouchables and weaker sections for participation in government. This brought to the forefront struggles like proportional representation in government and reservation of jobs. This imparted a new enthusiasm among oppressed masses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keralatourism.org/destination/destination.php?id=100|title=Pazhassi Raja Museum and Art Gallery, Kozhikode – Kerala Tourism|access-date=5 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115215308/http://www.keralatourism.org/destination/destination.php?id=100|archive-date=15 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><gallery mode="packed" widths="175">
