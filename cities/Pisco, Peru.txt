'''Pisco''' ({{langx|qu|Pisqu}}) is a city located in the [[Department of Ica]] of [[Peru]], the capital of the [[Pisco Province]]. The city is around 9 metres (28 feet) above sea level. Pisco was founded in 1640,<ref>[http://www.rpp.com.pe/2011-11-23-pisco-celebra-el-371%C2%B0-aniversario-de-fundacion-espanola-noticia_425009.html Pisco celebrates its 371st anniversary]</ref> close to the indigenous emplacement of the same name. Pisco originally prospered because of its nearby vineyards and became noted for its  [[pisco|grape brandy]] or [[pisco]]<ref name="global.britannica.com">[http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/461767/Pisco Pisco (Peru) at Encyclopædia Britannica]</ref> which was exported from its port. Pisco has an estimated population of 104,656 (est. 2015).<ref>[http://www.inei.gob.pe/biblioineipub/bancopub/Est/Lib0842/index.htm Peru population estimates at INEI.gob.pe]</ref>

== History ==
The city was highly populated until 1685, when it was pillaged by English pirates. The city suffered again in 1687 because of an earthquake. Vines are abundant, despite the sandy and infertile terrain; they grow in many places because of the moisture from inside the earth and provide Lima with its wines and grape concentrates that run along the various mountain provinces extending to  [[Panama]] and [[Guayaquil]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thepiscopeople.com.au/history-of-pisco/|title=History of Pisco|website=The Pisco People|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref>

Pisco was attacked by the pirates Clerck and David; in addition, in 1687 it was destroyed by an [[1687 Peru earthquake|earthquake]], which caused a [[tsunami]] to follow, destroying the city further. [[:es:Melchor Antonio Portocarrero Lazo de la Vega|Viceroy Melchor Antonio Portocarrero Lazo de la Vega]] then moved it to its current location, reestablishing it in 1689 as "Villa de Nuestra Señora de la Concordia de Pisco".

=== Mid 16th Century: Pisco is Born ===
The town of Santa Maria Magdalena, which was founded in 1572, had a port named Pisco, after the name of the valley in which it was located. This port became an important route for distribution of the liqueur throughout Peru. Demand for the product grew as sailors from around the world who called into the Port of Pisco created an important international trade link and further demand for the product. Over time, the town of Santa Maria Magdalena became simply known as '[[Pisco]]' with the same name adopted for the grape liqueur produced from the area. In a few decades, Pisco was distributed along the entire coast of Peru and Chile, as well as being exported through ports in the Pacific and Europe.

=== Independence of Peru ===
In 1820, the [[Liberating Expedition of Peru|Liberating Expedition]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historytoday.com/archive/months-past/liberation-peru|title=The Liberation of Peru {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Delaney|first=Robert W.|date=January 1962|title=General Miller and the Confederación Perú-Boliviana|journal=The Americas|volume=18|issue=3|pages=213–242|doi=10.2307/979153|issn=0003-1615|jstor=979153|s2cid=147014960 }}</ref> arrived in [[:es:Provincia de Pisco|Pisco]] under the command of [[José de San Martín]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jose-de-San-Martin|title=José de San Martín {{!}} Argentine revolutionary|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref> and [[:es:Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme|Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme]], [[:es:Desembarco de San Martín|disembarking]] in the [[:es:Bahía de Paracas|Bay of Paracas]], where the first [[:es:Bandera del Perú|flag]] and the first [[:es:Escudo del Perú|national emblem]] of Peru were created. In 1832, the [[Congress of the Republic of Peru|Peruvian Congress]]  ordered by [[law]] that the city of [[Lima]] would receive the title of "Villa y Puerto de la Independencia", extending this qualification to both the town and the riverbank population. In 1868 the "town of Pisco" was designated capital of the new [[:es:Provincia de Chincha|province of Chincha]], and in 1898 it was elevated to the rank of "[[city]]". In 1947, the historian pisqueño Mamerto Castillo Negrón said that Pisco had received two additions in its history that granted it [[:es:Honor|honors]] worthy of merit, the first being "Villa and Puerto de la Independencia" and second, its recognition as a provincial capital.

=== 2007 earthquake ===
{{stack|[[File:Pisco after the earthquake.jpg|thumb|Pisco after the earthquake]]}}

The city was very near the center of the devastating [[2007 Peru earthquake|8.0-magnitude earthquake]] which struck south central Peru on Wednesday 15 August 2007. Media officials reported that 80% of the city was destroyed, including the central San Clemente Cathedral of Pisco, located in Plaza de Armas in which [[Catholic mass|mass]] was taking place at the time of the earthquake.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6952985.stm Grim quake toll from Peru church at BBC News]</ref> The resulting dead account for a reported 30 percent of the total fatalities caused by the earthquake.<ref name="TCLEE 32">{{cite book|title=Pisco, Peru Earthquake of August 15, 2007|year=2008|publisher=ASCE, Technical Council on Lifeline Earthquake Engineering|location=Reston, VA|isbn=9780784410615|url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147486137&productid=16540|editor=Alex K Tang, PE and Jorgen Johansson|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114113456/http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147486137&productid=16540|archive-date=November 14, 2012}}</ref> Several hundred more were killed throughout the city<ref>{{cite web |title=Quake Orphan Reflects Peru’s Loss, and Anger (Published 2007) |website=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/25/world/americas/25peru.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin}}</ref>  Several years on, the city is still recovering from the damage done during the earthquake.<ref>[http://www.piscosinfronteras.org Pisco Sin Fronteras, an NGO working to help rebuild Pisco]</ref>

==Transport==
Pisco is served by the [[Capitán FAP Renán Elías Olivera Airport]] (IATA: PIO, ICAO: SPSO), located in Pisco (PIO).<ref>[[Capitán FAP Renán Elías Olivera Airport]]</ref> This international airport shares facilities with the [[Peruvian Air Force]] and is also designated as a back-up airport to the [[Jorge Chávez International Airport]] (IATA: LIM, ICAO: SPIM) in Lima, Peru.  On September 4, 2012, President Ollanta Humala was present for the beginning of renovations to the airport,<ref>[http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-2753-Peru-starts-work-at-Pisco-international-airport/ Peru starts work at Pisco international airport at Peru this Week]</ref> which is expected to be operational by 2015 with the ability to receive an anticipated 400,000 passengers a year in 2017.

==Tourist attractions==
Pisco is a [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] word meaning "bird".<ref name="global.britannica.com"/> The area is often visited because of the concentration of marine animals and birds at the [[Paracas National Reserve]], or the ''Peruvian Galápagos''.<ref>[http://www.trekker.co.il/english/pisco/ Pisco at Trekker.co.il]</ref> At the reserve there are the [[Islas Ballestas]], a collection of islands which are off limits to people, but boat tours can get close to. The [[Chincha Islands]] are also near its coast. Many bird species can be seen in the islands including [[pelican]]s, [[penguin]]s, [[cormorant]]s, [[Peruvian Booby|Peruvian boobies]], and [[Inca tern]]s, as well as sea lions, turtles, dolphins, and whales.

Another attraction in the area is [[Paracas Candelabra|El Candelabro]], a giant lamp dug in the rough sand in the method used by the creators of the [[Nazca Lines]].

One of the major ancient civilizations in [[Peru]], the [[Paracas culture]], flourished in the area where Pisco sits. Due to its ease of access and its crossroads to the [[Andes]], the Spaniards may have considered making Pisco the capital, before they decided on [[Lima, Peru|Lima]].

In the city is the [[Plaza de Armas]], where people buy [[Teja (confectionery)|tejas]], small sweets made from pecans and assorted [[dried fruit]]s. Many different building that surround the Plaza are the statue of [[José de San Martín]], the mansion he lived in, and the Municipal Palace. Other building in the city is the heavily baroque Iglesia de la Compañía, begun in 1689, features a superb carved pulpit and gold-leaf altarpiece.

Near the town, just off the road to [[Ayacucho]], lies the large, well-preserved [[Inca]] site of [[Tambo Colorado]].
