'''Girona''' ({{IPA|ca|ʒiˈɾonə|lang|Pronunciation of Girona in Catalan.ogg}}; {{langx|es|Gerona}} {{IPA|es|xeˈɾona||Pronunciation_of_Girona_in_Spanish.ogg}}) is the [[capital city]] of the [[province of Girona]] in the [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]], at the confluence of the [[Ter River|Ter]], [[Onyar]], Galligants, and [[Güell]] rivers. The city had an official population of 103,369 in 2020 but, the population of the Girona–[[Salt, Girona|Salt]] urban area is estimated to be about 156,400 (2020).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.idescat.cat/emex/?id=170792|title=Idescat. El municipi en xifres|website=www.idescat.cat}}</ref> Girona is also capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of the [[Gironès]] and the [[vegueria]] of Girona. Since much of the old quarter of this ancient city has been preserved, Girona is a popular destination for tourists. The city is located {{convert|99|km|0|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Barcelona]].

==History==
{{see also|Jews of Catalonia}}

[[File:Riu Onyar a Girona, c. 1852.jpg|thumb|Onyar river in Girona, c. 1852|left]]
The first historical inhabitants in the region were [[Iberians]]; Girona is the ancient '''Gerunda''',<ref>{{Cite web |last=Iñesta |first=Enric Cabrejas |date=2016-12-26 |title=Per què es diu Girona? |url=https://www.diaridegirona.cat/girona/2016/12/26/per-diu-girona-49087367.html |access-date=2024-01-21 |website=Diari de Girona |language=ca}}</ref> a city of the [[Ausetani]]. Later, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] built a [[citadel]] there, which was given the name of ''Gerunda''. The [[Visigoths]] ruled in Girona until it was conquered by the [[Moors]] in 715. [[Charlemagne]] reconquered it in 785 and made it one of the fourteen original [[counties]] of Catalonia. It was sacked by the Moors in 827, 842, 845, 935, and 982. [[Wilfred the Hairy, Count of Barcelona|Wilfred the Hairy]] incorporated Girona into the [[County of Barcelona]] in 878.

In the 11th century, [[Alfonso II of Aragon|Alfonso II of Aragon and I of Barcelona]] declared Girona a city. The ancient county became a [[duchy]] within the [[Principality of Catalonia]] in 1351 when King [[Peter III of Aragon]] gave the title of [[Duke]] to his first-born son, John. In 1414, King [[Ferdinand I of Aragon|Ferdinand I]] in turn gave the title of [[Principality of Girona|Prince of Girona]] to his first-born son, [[Alfonso V of Aragon|Alfonso]]. The title is currently carried by Princess [[Leonor, Princess of Asturias|Leonor]] of [[Principality of Asturias|Asturias]], the second since the 16th century to do so.

The earliest documented evidence of a Jewish community in Girona dates to about 885.<ref name="Alberch">{{cite book | title=Jewry Guide of Girona|author=Ramon Alberch i Fugueras|publisher=Certeza and the City Council of Girona|location=Girona, Spain|year=2005|pages=131|isbn=978-8472131859}}</ref>  The 12th century saw the [[Jew]]ish community of Girona flourish, having one of the most important [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] schools in Europe. The [[Rabbi]] of Girona, [[Nahmanides|Moshe ben Nahman Gerondi]] (better known as Nahmanides or Ramban) was appointed Great Rabbi of Catalonia. Centered on the [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish Call]] (Call Jueu), the Jewish community of Girona came to an end in 1492,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-01-18 |title=Girona {{!}} Spain, Map, History, & Facts {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Girona-Spain |access-date=2024-01-21 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> when the [[Catholic Monarchs]] outlawed Judaism throughout [[Spain]] and Jews were given the choice of conversion or exile (see [[Alhambra Decree]]). For 400 years before that time, the Jewish cemetery was located beside the road to France, just north of the old city between the mountain [[Montjuïc (Girona)|Montjuïc]], or ''hill of the Jews'' in medieval Catalan, and the river Ter.<ref name="Alberch"/>

Girona has undergone twenty-five [[siege]]s and been captured seven times.{{Citation needed|date=October 2023}} It was besieged by the French royal armies under Charles de Monchy d'Hocquincourt in 1653, under [[Bernardin Gigault de Bellefonds]] in 1684, and twice in 1694 under [[Anne Jules de Noailles]]. During the [[Third siege of Girona]] of the [[Peninsular War]], the city was besieged from May to December 1809 by 35,000 French [[Napoleon]]ic troops under Vergier, [[Pierre François Charles Augereau, duc de Castiglione|Augereau]] and [[Laurent, marquis de Gouvion Saint-Cyr|Gouvion Saint-Cyr]].  Continuously under heavy bombardment, Girona held out obstinately under the leadership of [[Mariano Álvarez de Castro|Álvarez de Castro]] until disease and famine compelled it to capitulate on 12 December.  Girona was the center of the [[Ter (department)|Ter department]] during the French rule, which lasted from 1809 to 1813. The defensive [[city wall]]s of the western side were demolished at the end of the 19th century to allow for the expansion of the city, while the walls of the eastern side remained untouched but abandoned.{{Citation needed|date=October 2023}}

In recent years{{When|date=October 2023|reason="Recent"  not a clear definition of time.}}, the missing parts of the city walls on the eastern side of the city have been reconstructed. Called the ''Passeig de la Muralla'' it now forms a tourist route around the old city.

== Geography ==
Girona was founded in a strategic place, in the natural corridor between the [[Empordà]] plain and the [[Catalan Coastal Depression]], therefore connecting by land the northern [[Costa Brava]] and [[France]] with [[Barcelona]] and other southern populations. This corridor is a [[Defile (geography)|defile]] formed by the [[Ter river]] between the [[Gavarres]] massif and the [[Catalan Transversal Range]].

The Ter river is the most important water course in the region. In Girona it flows through the north of the town, from southwest to northeast. It is in Girona where the Ter meets the [[Onyar]], the second largest river in the area. The Onyar crosses the city from south to north and it has historically conditioned the city's development, as catastrophic floods have periodically affected the town since historic times.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ribas Palom |first1=Anna |title=Girona i les inundacions |url=https://cdn.girona.cat/sgdap/sgdapdocs/ConfAMGi_2015_Ribas.pdf |publisher=Ajuntament de Girona |access-date=11 March 2024}}</ref>

=== Seismic activity ===
Girona is located in a seismic zone, which means it occasionally has [[earthquakes]] throughout the year. Most of them are not felt, and some are felt as a minor vibration or light shaking.
The strongest earthquake recorded in Girona was the magnitude 6.7 Catalonia 1428 earthquake.

=== Climate ===
Girona has a humid Mediterranean climate. According to the [[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system|Köppen climate classification]], Girona has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') transitioning to a [[Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa''), with mild winters and hot summers. In winter, frost occurs frequently (41.3 days per year from November to March), but snowfall is quite rare. Temperatures in winter can drop to below {{convert|-2|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, especially during days with [[thermal inversion]]. Average annual rainfall is usually slightly above {{convert|700|mm|inches|abbr=on}}. The wettest seasons are autumn (September–November) and spring (April–early June). [[Thunderstorms]] can occur throughout the year, more frequently in summer, averaging 23.9 days per year. but usually there still is a significant arid period.<ref>{{cite web |title=Climatologia. El Gironès. 1971-2000 |url=https://static-m.meteo.cat/wordpressweb/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/06103704/el_Giron%C3%A8s.pdf |publisher=Servei Meteorològic de Catalunya |access-date=11 March 2024}}</ref> This can be seen through the natural vegetation around the city, as drought-tolerant oaks (''[[Quercus ilex]]'' and, to a lesser extent, ''[[Quercus suber]]'' and ''[[Quercus pubescens]]'') and pines (''[[Pinus pinaster]]'', ''[[Pinus pinea]]'' and ''[[Pinus halepensis]]'') dominate the majority of the plant communities.

== Main sights ==

{{See also|Category:Museums in Girona}}

Girona is a popular destination for tourists and Barcelona day-trippers - the train journey from Barcelona Sants to Girona takes approximately forty minutes on high-speed trains, eighty with express ones and ninety with regional ones. The old town stands on the steep hill of the Caputxins to the east of the river Onyar, while the more modern section stands on the plains to the west. The city has a number of ''[[Art Nouveau]]'' buildings including the ''Farinera Teixidor'' by Rafael Masó.

=== Cathedral ===
[[File:Cathedral in Girona.JPG|thumb|upright|Girona cathedral during the annual flower exhibition]]
The ancient cathedral, which stood on the site of the present one, was used by the Moors as a mosque, and after their final expulsion was either entirely remodelled or rebuilt. The [[Girona Cathedral|present edifice]] is one of the most important monuments of the school of the Majorcan architect Jaume Fabre and an excellent example of Catalan Gothic architecture. It is approached in ninety steps. An aisle and chapels surround the choir, which opens by three arches into the nave, of which the pointed stone vault is the widest in Christendom (22 meters). Among its interior decorations is a retable which is the work of the Valencian silversmith Pere Bernec. It is divided into three tiers of statuettes and reliefs, framed in canopied niches of cast and hammered silver. A gold and silver altar-frontal was carried off by the French in 1809. The cathedral contains the tombs of [[Ramon Berenguer II, Count of Barcelona|Ramon Berenguer]] and his wife.

=== Old fortifications ===
The old fortifications are another popular sight. Historically, these have played a vital role in protecting Girona from invaders for hundreds of years. The city wall of the old town was an important military construction built in Roman times in the 1st century BC. It was thoroughly rebuilt under the reign of Peter III the Ceremonious in the second half of the 14th century. The Roman wall was used as a foundation. At the start of the 16th century, the wall was absorbed into the city. The walled precinct lost its military value. Bit by bit, the wall was degrading, as parts were gradually altered from the inside and the outside. The walls and lookout towers that make up these fortifications are split in two - a small section to the north of the old town and a much larger section to the east and south. It is possible to walk the walls and climb the towers, where visitors can enjoy panoramic views of Girona and the surrounding countryside.

=== Sant Feliu ===
[[File:Girona 095.JPG|thumb|upright|The Collegiate Church of Sant Feliu, as seen from the river Onyar]]
The [[Collegiate Church]] of [[Church of St. Felix, Girona|Sant Feliu]] is noteworthy from an architectural point of view. Its style is 14th-century Gothic, the façade dating from the 18th, and it is one of the few Spanish churches that possesses a genuine spire. It contains, besides the sepulchre of its patron and the tomb of the valiant Álvarez, a chapel dedicated to St. Narcissus, who according to tradition was one of the early bishops of the see.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2002/feb/14/spain.gerona |title=Catalonia got the cream |first=Jon |last=Dennis |date=14 February 2002 |access-date=29 May 2016}}</ref>

=== Sant Pere de Galligants ===
[[File:Sant Pere de Galligants.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Sant Pere de Galligants]]
The [[Benedictine]] church of the monastery of [[Sant Pere de Galligants]] is in the early Romanesque style, dating to about the year 1130, though the monastery dates to about 950. The monastery slightly predates the [[Monastery of St. Daniel (Girona)|Monastery of St. Daniel]].

=== Plaça de la Independència ===
[[File:Girona 007.JPG|thumb|right|The Independence Square monument honors the city's defenders during the sieges of 1808 and 1809.]]
The Plaça de la Independència is one of the best-known and busiest squares in Girona. Located in the Mercadal district in the city centre, it is also known as Plaça de Sant Agustí, after the former Convent of Sant Agustí. Its name refers to the 1808–1814 War of Spanish Independence, part of the larger [[Peninsular War]], against [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]].

The interest of the square lies in its 19th-century style, despite its being surrounded by identical austere neoclassical buildings with porches dedicated to the defenders of the city of Girona during the [[Third Siege of Girona|1808 and 1809 sieges]].
 
However, the symmetrical proportions of the square correspond more to contemporary interventions than its architectural past. The municipal architect Martí Sureda was the first to conceive an arcaded square with closed and neoclassical loops, and with some buildings having matching aesthetic proportions. The development of the area followed this scheme only in part. The construction of the first theatres in the city transgressed the concept of Martí Sureda. Until the 18th century, what that architect had imagined could not be completed. This part of the city in [[Noucentisme]] style is a romantic and timeless creation that nowadays captivates inhabitants and visitors. Today the area has great vitality because of the spread of cafés and restaurants, including some businesses well known for their history like the Café Royal, Cinema [[Albéniz]] and [[Casa Marieta]].<ref>{{cite web |title = Diari de Girona / 20 d'agost del 2000|url = http://streaming.ajgirona.org:9090/pandora/cgi-bin/Pandora.exe?xslt=show_pdf;publication=Diari%20de%20Girona;sort_publication=diari.de.girona;day=20;mes=08;año=2000;page=006;id=0000258777;filename=20000820;collection=pages;url_high=pages/Diari%20de%20Girona/2000/200008/20000820/20000820006.pdf;lang=ca;pdf_parameters=search=%22marieta%22&view=FitH;encoding=utf-8 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141104001329/http://streaming.ajgirona.org:9090/pandora/cgi-bin/Pandora.exe?xslt=show_pdf;publication=Diari%20de%20Girona;sort_publication=diari.de.girona;day=20;mes=08;a%C3%B1o=2000;page=006;id=0000258777;filename=20000820;collection=pages;url_high=pages/Diari%20de%20Girona/2000/200008/20000820/20000820006.pdf;lang=ca;pdf_parameters=search=%22marieta%22&view=FitH;encoding=utf-8 |url-status = dead |archive-date = 2014-11-04 }}</ref>

=== Cases de l'Onyar ===
[[File:Casas del Oñar (Cases de l'Onyar) en Gerona o Girona. Cataluña, España.jpg|thumb|Houses on the river Onyar]]

Characteristic of Girona are the picturesque houses overlooking the river Onyar. These were built over many years and give the flavour of a small Mediterranean city. The façanes are painted according to a palette created by Enric Ansesa, James J. Faixó and the architects Fuses and J. Viader.

One of these houses (at Ballesteries 29, Girona) is [[Masó House|Casa Masó]], the birthplace of the architect [[Rafael Masó i Valentí|Rafael Masó]] and an example of [[Noucentisme]] in Girona. Since 2006 it has been the headquarters of the [http://www.rafaelmaso.org Fundació Rafael Masó]. The river façade can be recognised by its unique white color.

=== Jewish heritage ===
[[File:Jewish Quarter Gerona.jpg|thumb|upright|A lane in the Jewish Quarter. Girona's Jewish community was lost as a result of the Expulsion.]]
Today, the historic Jewish quarter or ''Call'' has been restored. In 1492 the Jewish community was forced to choose between conversion and expulsion. After the Jews left, the neighborhood was sealed off and new houses were built over the old ones.<ref name="Alberch"/> When the dictator Francisco Franco died in 1975, interest in the region's cultural history was revived. Some of the old buildings were excavated leading to the discovery of the home of [[Nahmanides]], which was sold to the city in 1987.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |title=Catalonia Pays Homage to Nachmanides |url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/2005-02-01/ty-article/catalonia-pays-homage-to-nachmanides/0000017f-ded0-db22-a17f-fef1231f0000 |access-date=2024-01-10 |work=Haaretz |language=en}}</ref>

A rectangular indentation that once held a [[mezuzah]] can be seen on the doorway of an old building on Carrer de Sant Llorenç, while Centre Bonastruc ça Porta on Carrer de la Força is the site of a 15th century synagogue.

During the professional cycling season, various non-European pro cyclists have called Girona home, as illustrated in the book<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1931382611|title=Inside the Postal Bus: My Ride with Lance Armstrong and the U.S. Postal Cycling Team|first=Michael|last=Barry|date=10 April 2005|publisher=VeloPress|via=Amazon}}</ref> by [[Michael Barry (cyclist)|Michael Barry]], written during his time with the US Postal Service cycling team. Between races, cyclists do their training rides outside the city, which provides excellent training terrain.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cycling in Girona: bike riding traveller's guide |url=https://www.cyclingweekly.com/routes/cycling-in-girona-377321|newspaper=[[Cycling Weekly]]|date=25 April 2018| first=Michelle |last=Arthurs-Brennan}}</ref>

In the Spring of 1997, [[Marty Jemison]], [[Tyler Hamilton]] and [[George Hincapie]] moved to Girona as teammates of the US Postal Service Professional Cycling Team. This was the first year that American cyclists started living in Girona and meeting for training rides at the Pont de Pedra. Later, other well-known professional cyclists such as [[Lance Armstrong]] came to live in the city.

Football is also widely popular. The local Football club is [[Girona FC]], who were promoted to [[La Liga]] in 2017. In December 2023, they recorded their first ever league victory over [[FC Barcelona]] to temporarily reach the top of the table.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67678165|title=Girona top La Liga after famous win at Barcelona|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref> The club's stadium is [[Estadi Montilivi]].

The city has a [[roller hockey (quad)|roller hockey]] team, [[GEiEG]], one of the most important in Spain, which competes in the main League [[OK Liga]].

==Education==
The city is the home of the [[Jaume Vicens Vives Secondary School]], as well as the [[University of Girona|Universitat de Girona]] (University of Girona).

== Economy and infrastructure ==
===Transport===
[[File:GironaPasseigDeLaMuralla.jpg|thumb|Girona landmarks include [[Girona Cathedral|Saint Mary's Cathedral]] (left) and the City Walls Walkway (right).]]

====Road====
The town is on the [[Autopista AP-7]] and N-II. The city is also the hub of the local road network with routes to the coast and inland towards the Pyrenees.

====Buses====
The city has a comprehensive urban bus service operated by private companies. There are also services to the other towns in the Girona province and long-distance buses.

====Rail====
Girona is served at its new [[Girona railway station|railway station]] to the west of the Old Town. There are conventional trains from [[Barcelona]] to [[Portbou]] and the French border.

Girona is also an important stop on the [[AVE]] services from Paris, Marseille, Toulouse and Figueres to Barcelona, and from Figueres to Barcelona and Madrid.

The journey time to Barcelona is approximately 1 hour 35 minutes on the stopping "Regional" trains, 1 hour and 15 minutes by conventional train ("Media Distancia") or 37 minutes on the [[AVE]]. Madrid is reached in 3&nbsp;h 45&nbsp;min, also on the AVE.

====Airport====
{{main|Girona–Costa Brava Airport}}

The town's airport, Girona-Costa Brava, is {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} south of the town centre. It grew tremendously principally as a result of [[Ryanair]] choosing it as one of their European hubs, but then shrunk again after they relocated most of the flights to [[Barcelona El Prat]].

[[Girona airport|Girona Airport]] is approximately a 30-minute bus ride from the bus terminal and train station in Girona city, and an hour from [[Barcelona]] centre, {{convert|92|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south. The bus stops in the centre of Barcelona, at the ''[[Estació d'Autobusos Barcelona Nord]]'', Barcelona's main bus terminal.

Most low-cost airlines mention "Barcelona" in their descriptions of Girona airport.
