== History ==
The area of Takarazuka was part of ancient [[Settsu Province]] and has been inhabited since ancient times, with many ''[[kofun]]'' [[burial mound]]s found within the city limits. The [[Mefu Jinja]] dates from the [[Nara period]]. From the [[Heian period]], numerous landed estates ''[[shōen]]'' controlled by the [[Fujiwara family]] were developed in the area. Takarazuka [[onsen]] is mentioned in [[Kamakura period]] records. In the [[Muromachi period]], Kohama town developed as a temple town for Kōshō-ji, and subsequently  Kohama Inn was established as a post station on Arima Road. The area was mostly  ''[[tenryō]]'' territory under direct control of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in the [[Edo Period]]. 

The village of Kohama (小浜村) was established on April 1, 1889 within [[Kawabe District, Hyōgo]], with the creation of the modern municipalities system. In 1897, Hankaku Railroad (current [[Fukuchiyama Line]]) completed. In 1910, the Minoh Arima Electric Railway (current [[Hankyu Takarazuka Main Line]] completed). Takarazuka was a center of the culture from the 1910s to 1940s in what has been dubbed the age of [[Hanshinkan Modernism]]. This included the opening of the Takarazuka Girls' Opera (current [[Takarazuka Revue]]) on April 1, 1914.

Kohama was elevated to town status on March 15, 1951, changing its name to Takarazuka. On April 1 1954 it merged with the village of Yoshimoto (吉本村) in Muko District  to become the city of Takarazuka. The city continued to expand by annexing Nagao Village on March 10, 1955, and Nishitani Village on March 14, 1955, but losing some areas in a border adjustment with the city of Itami on April 1, 1955. On January 17, 1995 the [[Great Hanshin earthquake]] caused more than 100 casualties. Takarazuka was designated as a [[Special cities of Japan|Special City]] on April 1, 2003 with increased autonomy.

At one time, the idea was raised of merging Takarazuka with [[Itami, Hyōgo|Itami]], [[Kawanishi, Hyōgo|Kawanishi]], and [[Inagawa, Hyōgo|Inagawa]], but it is currently on hold.

==Government==
Takarazuka has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 26 members. Takarazuka contributes three members to the Hyōgo Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between the Hyōgo 6th districts of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Takarazuka has a mixed economy of commerce, manufacturing and market gardening. It is increasingly becoming a [[bedroom community]] for [[Osaka]] and [[Kobe]], with quiet, upscale residential neighborhoods like Nigawa, Obayashi, Sakasegawa, and Hibarigaoka.
