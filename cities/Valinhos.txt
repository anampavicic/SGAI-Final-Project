'''Valinhos''' ({{IPA|pt|vaˈliɲus}}) is a [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] (''município'') in the state of [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. It is the birthplace of [[Adoniran Barbosa]].

== History ==
The city was founded on 2 December 1732 by Alexandre Simões Vieira. A passage between the villages of [[São Paulo]] and [[Jundiaí]] had been opened. The main economic foundation of the town in the 19th century was the production of coffee, figs and grapes. Later on, a railway was created to transport the products to the [[Port of Santos]].

Since the fig has been a town's symbol, the city counsel organizes the Festa do Figo (a traditional Fig Fest, attended by more than 75,000 people yearly). The city is mainly composed by closed neighbourhoods, [[Condominium (living space)|condominium complexes]] and some residential buildings. There is also a [[Colégio Visconde de Porto Seguro]].

== Geography ==
Mostly two thirds of the area is a rural community scattered around {{convert|89|km²|0|abbr=on}}, however, the urban area is growing as soon as the neighbourhoods are built. Around the city are the most important highways of the state of São Paulo, which are named  Anhanguera, Bandeirantes and Dom Pedro I.  They connect all parts of the state and are considered the best highways in the country.
