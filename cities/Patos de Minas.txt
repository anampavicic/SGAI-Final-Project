'''Patos de Minas''' is a [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] in the [[States of Brazil|state]] of [[Minas Gerais]] in [[Brazil]].

== Geography ==
According to the modern (2017) geographic classification by Brazil's National Institute of Geography and Statistics ([[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]), the city is the main municipality in the [[Intermediate Geographic Region of Patos de Minas]].

==History==
The name is derived from the ranch known as farmhouse Os Patos, owned by the original settlers, which had the name because of the large number of wild ducks found in the region.  In 1826 the first settlers, Antônio da Silva Guerra and his wife, Luísa Correia de Andrade, donated lands for the new settlement, called Vila de Santo Antônio dos Patos. In 1892 Patos de Minas gained city status with the name of Patos, which was lengthened in 1944 to Patos de Minas.<ref>[http://www.ferias.tur.br/informacoes/3549/patos-de-minas-mg.html Ferias]</ref>

==High standard of living==
Patos de Minas occupies a privileged position in the ranking of cities in the state and country in socio-economic development.  A study in [[Veja (magazine)|Veja magazine]] in 2001 placed Patos in fifth place among five thousand cities with the greatest socio-economic development between 1970 and 1996.<ref name="City government site">[http://www.patosdeminas.mg.gov.br/ City government site]</ref>

Rare among Brazilian cities of this size, around 99% of all the streets of the city are paved and have public lighting and almost all of the inhabitants (97%) receive [[water purification|treated water]].  Sewage treatment reached 98% of the urban population.  [http://www.patosdeminas.mg.gov.br/ City government site]

Patos is known nationally for its corn production.  The "Princess of the Alto Paranaíba" as it is called, has become the national capital of corn, a fact that has attracted investors from all over the country to set up industries in [[agriculture|agro-industry]], [[garments]], beverages, and packaging. It is also one of the most important [[seed]] producing centers in the country.

Corn is so important in the life of the town that every May Patos puts on a festival, the biggest in the state, called [[Fenamilho]], the Festa Nacional do Milho (National Corn Festival), in which there are rodeos and performances by country and western groups.<ref name="City government site"/>
