==History==
Earthenware pottery fragments from the Kamifukuoka Shell Mound dating to the Early [[Jōmon period]], were discovered beneath the Dainihon Print Company in Fujimino, indicating a long period of settlement. The city also has an important early [[Kofun period]] archaeological site, the Gongenyama Tumuli Cluster, from the late 3rd century. During the [[Edo period]], the port of Fukuoka was an important river port on a branch of the [[Arakawa River (Kantō)|Arakawa River]] and was under the control of [[Kawagoe Domain]].

The village of Fukuoka was created within Iruma District, Saitama with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. The first [[public housing]] estates (Uenodai and Kasumigaoka) in Japan were built in Fukuoka after the Second World War. The village was raised to town status in 1960 as population expanded rapidly due to [[new town]] developments, and to city status on April 10, 1972, changing its name to Kamifukuoka to avoid confusion with the more famous city of [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]] in [[Kyushu]].

The city of Fujimino was established on October 1, 2005, from the merger of the city of [[Kamifukuoka, Saitama|Kamifukuoka]], and the neighboring town of [[Ōi, Saitama|Ōi]] (from [[Iruma District, Saitama|Iruma District]]).

==Government==
Fujimino has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 21 members. Fujimino, together with the town of Miyoshi, contributes two members to the Saitama Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of [[Saitama 8th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Due to its location, Fujimino is primarily a [[bedroom community]] with over 25% of its population commuting to the Tokyo metropolis for work. There are a number of [[industrial park]]s in the city.

==Education==
Fujimino has 13 public elementary schools and six public middle schools operated by the city government, and one public high school operated by the Saitama Prefectural Board of Education. [[Bunkyo University]] also has a campus in Fujimino.
