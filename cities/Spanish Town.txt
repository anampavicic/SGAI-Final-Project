'''Spanish Town''' is the capital and the largest town in the [[Parishes of Jamaica|parish]] of [[St. Catherine, Jamaica|St. Catherine]] in the historic county of [[Middlesex, Jamaica|Middlesex]], [[Jamaica]]. It was the Spanish and British capital of [[Jamaica]] from 1534 until 1872. The town is home to numerous memorials, the [[Jamaica Archives and Records Department|national archives]], and one of the oldest [[Anglican church]]es outside England (the others are in [[Virginia]], [[Maryland]], and [[Bermuda]]).

==History==
[[File:Hakewill, A Picturesque Tour of the Island of Jamaica, Plate 01.jpg|thumb|''King's Square, St. Jago de la Vega'' (Spanish Town), 1820-21 from [[James Hakewill]]'s ''A Picturesque Tour of the Island of Jamaica'' (1825).<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/picturesquetouro00hake|title=A Picturesque Tour of the Island of Jamaica &c.|last=Hakewill|first=James.|date=1825|publisher=London: Hurst and Robinson & E. Lloyd}}</ref>]]

The Spanish settlement of '''Villa de la Vega''' was founded by the Spanish in 1534 as the capital of the colony. Later, it was also called '''Santiago de la Vega''' or '''St. Jago de la Vega'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/picturesquetouro00hake|title=A picturesque tour of the island of Jamaica|first=James|last=Hakewill|date=4 May 2019|publisher=London : Hurst and Robinson [etc]|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Indigenous [[Taíno people|Taino]] had been living in the area for approximately a millennium before this, but this was the first European habitation on the south of the island.

When the [[Invasion of Jamaica|English conquered Jamaica in 1655]], they renamed the settlement as Spanish Town in honour to the original Spanish root of this town. Since the town was badly damaged during the conquest, [[Port Royal]] took on many administrative roles and functioned as an unofficial capital during the beginning of English rule. By the time Port Royal was devastated by an [[1692 Jamaica earthquake|earthquake in 1692]], Spanish Town had been rebuilt and was again functioning as the capital. Spanish Town remained the capital until 1872, when the seat of the colony was moved to [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]].

Kingston had been founded in the aftermath of the 1692 earthquake. By 1755, serious rivalry from lobbyists caused increasing speculation about the continued suitability of Spanish Town as the capital. In 1836, Governor [[Sir Lionel Smith, 1st Baronet|Lionel Smith]] observed that "the capital was in ruins, with no commercial, manufacturing and agricultural concern in operation."{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} To worsen the situation, following the [[Morant Bay Rebellion of 1865]], Sir [[John Peter Grant]] ordered the removal of the capital in 1872 to Kingston. As a larger port, it had come to be considered the [[natural capital]] of the island.  After the seat of government was relocated, Spanish Town lost much of its economic and cultural vitality.

==Points of interest==
Built on the west bank of the [[Rio Cobre]], the town lies 13 miles from Kingston on the main road.  Its history was shaped by two significant colonial periods: Spanish rule from 1534 to 1655 and the English from 1655 to 1872. After that the capital was relocated to Kingston. The Anglican Church took over the 16th century cathedral.

The historic architecture and street names mark the colonial history, such as Red Church and White Church streets, symbolic of the Spanish chapels of the red and white cross, as well as Monk Street, in reference to the [[monastery]] that once stood nearby. Nugent and Manchester streets were named for the British Colonial Governors, [[Sir George Nugent, 1st Baronet|George Nugent]] and [[William Montagu, 5th Duke of Manchester]]. King Street runs past the King's House, the governor's residence, and Constitution Street, near to the Square, refers to the island's former administrative centre. [[English Regency|Regency]] buildings in the town centre include the [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Rodney]] Memorial flanked by two guns from the [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)]],<ref name="Aspinall 1907">{{cite book |last1=Aspinall |first1=Algernon E. |title=The pocket guide to the West Indies, British Guiana, British Honduras, the Bermudas, the Spanish Main, and the Panama canal. |date=1907 |publisher=Rand, McNally & Company |pages=188–189 |edition=New and revised 1914 |url=https://archive.org/stream/pocketguidetowes00aspi/pocketguidetowes00aspi#page/188/mode/1up |access-date=23 July 2018}}</ref> and the façade of the Old King's House, which was the residence of the governor until 1872.

===Old Iron Bridge===
[[File:Hakewill, A Picturesque Tour of the Island of Jamaica, Plate 02.jpg|thumb|The Iron Bridge]]
Spanish Town is the site of an early [[cast-iron]] bridge, designed by Thomas Wilson and manufactured by Walker and Company of [[Rotherham]], England. Spanning the Rio Cobre, the bridge was erected in 1801 at a cost of £4,000.<ref>[http://www.jnht.com/heritage_site.php?id=217 Spanish Town] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925160737/http://jnht.com/heritage_site.php?id=217 |date=25 September 2010 }}, Jamaica National Heritage Trust</ref> Its four arched ribs are supported on massive masonry [[abutments]]. After the abutments deteriorated, endangering the structure, it was listed in the [[1998 World Monuments Watch]] by the [[World Monuments Fund]].<ref>[http://www.wmf.org/project/old-iron-bridge Old Iron Bridge], World Monuments Fund</ref>

A restoration project began in 2004, with funding provided by [[American Express]] through [[World Monuments Fund]].<ref>[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/60368_-3-8-m-restoration-starts-on-Spanish-Town-iron-bridge-this-week "$3.8-m restoration starts on Spanish Town iron bridge this week"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629104826/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/60368_-3-8-m-restoration-starts-on-Spanish-Town-iron-bridge-this-week |date=29 June 2011 }}, ''Jamaica Observer,''  26 May 2004</ref> Progress was slow until 2008, when a renewed restoration effort was made. A first phase of restoration was completed in April 2010, when the repair of the abutments allowed the bridge to be reopened for the public.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jnht.com/news/2010/04/spanish_town_iron_bridge_a_lit.php |title=Jamaica National Heritage Trust, ''Spanish Town Iron Bridge a little safer for residents,'' April 29, 2010. |access-date=30 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304071839/http://www.jnht.com/news/2010/04/spanish_town_iron_bridge_a_lit.php |archive-date=4 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> More recently, violence in the area has prevented the bridge from achieving the status of a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>[https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Violence-preventing-Spanish-Town-monuments-from-receiving--heritage-site Erica Virtue, "Violence preventing Spanish Town monuments from receiving 'heritage site' status"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724060014/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Violence-preventing-Spanish-Town-monuments-from-receiving--heritage-site |date=24 July 2010 }}, ''Jamaica Observer,'' 21 July 2010</ref>

==Today==
In 2009, the population of Spanish Town was estimated to be about 160,000.<ref name="WG">[http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&men=gpro&lng=en&des=wg&geo=-109&srt=npan&col=abcdefghinoq&msz=1500&pt=c&va=&geo=388810305 World Gazetteer.] {{dead link|date=July 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The population of Spanish Town, like the rest of the St. Catherine, has been growing rapidly.

It is sometimes referred to colloquially as "Spain" or "Prison Oval" within Jamaica. The latter nickname is a reference to the [[cricket]] pitch or oval located just outside the St. Catherine District Prison, where some inmates can get a limited view of the sport through their cell windows. Association football is also played at the [[Prison Oval]]; [[Rivoli United F.C.]] is the major team.

The town had one of the first Spanish cathedrals to be built in the New World, constructed around 1525. Many Christian denominations have churches or meeting halls in the town, including a Roman Catholic church and Wesleyan, Baptist and Seventh-day Adventist chapels. There is also a mosque.<ref>[http://jamfash.tripod.com/muslim.html Joanna Ferguson, "The Muslim Minority in Jamaica"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219182205/http://jamfash.tripod.com/muslim.html |date=19 February 2009 }},  ''JamBeat'', Volume 2 Number 1, 2006–03.</ref>

Standing untouched in character is a historic alms-house, public hospital, and a penal institution built in the eighteenth century. The town contains a factory that manufactures dyes from [[logwood]], a salt factory, and a rice processing plant. In the neighbourhood are five large sugar estates, a milk condensary, and a large textile mill.

==Government and infrastructure==
The [[Rio Cobre Juvenile Correctional Centre]] of the [[Department of Correctional Services, Jamaica]] is located in Spanish Town.<ref>"[http://www.dcsj.net/dcsj/juveniles.htm JUVENILE CORRECTIONAL CENTRES] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614100020/http://www.dcsj.net/dcsj/juveniles.htm |date=14 June 2011 }}." [[Department of Correctional Services, Jamaica]]. Retrieved on 2 October 2010.</ref>

==Transport==
===Roads===
Spanish Town is on the main [[A1 road (Jamaica)|A1]] ([[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] to [[Lucea, Jamaica|Lucea]]) and [[A2 road (Jamaica)|A2]] (Spanish Town to [[Savanna-la-Mar]]) roads.<ref>Road map of Jamaica, Texaco, 1972.</ref> It is well served by buses, mini buses and taxis, which operate from the [http://wikimapia.org/#lat=17.9911674&lon=-76.9564283&z=18&l=0&m=b&v=1 Spanish Town Transport Hub].

===Rail===
The now disused [[Spanish Town railway station]] formerly provided access to four lines:
*[[Railways of Jamaica: Kingston to Montego Bay|Kingston to Montego Bay]]
*[[Railways of Jamaica: Spanish Town to Ewarton|Spanish Town to Ewarton]]
*[[Railways of Jamaica: Bog Walk to Port Antonio|Bog Walk to Port Antonio]]
*[[Railways of Jamaica: Linstead to New Works|Linstead to New Works]]

The station opened in 1845 and closed in October 1992 when all passenger traffic on Jamaica's railways abruptly ceased.<ref name="JTH18">[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3884/is_200303/ai_n9209497/pg_18 The rise and fall of railways in Jamaica, 1845–1975 – Pg18] Journal of Transport History – March 2003</ref>
