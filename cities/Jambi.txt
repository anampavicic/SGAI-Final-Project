==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Moskee Djambi TMnr 10016664.jpg|thumb|left|Mosque in Jambi, during the [[Dutch East Indies|colonial period]]. ca 1900–1939.]]

Jambi was the site of the [[Melayu Kingdom|Melayu kingdom]] that engaged in trade throughout the [[Strait of Malacca]] and beyond. It was recorded as having sent a mission to China in 644 CE. It was annexed by [[Srivijaya]] by 685 CE, but tried to declare its independence in the 9th century. Jambi succeeded [[Palembang]], its southern economic and military rival, as the major player in trade in the Malacca straits. After the 1025 [[Chola]] [[Chola invasion of Srivijaya|raids in Southeast Asia]], Jambi still sent missions to China.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Miksic |first=John M. |title=Singapore and the Silk Road of the Sea, 1300–1800 |publisher=NUS Press |year=2013 |isbn=9789971695583 |author1-link=John N. Miksic}}</ref>{{rp|72, 114}}

In the early decades of the Dutch presence in the region, when the Dutch were one of several traders competing with the British, Chinese, Arabs, and Malays, the [[Jambi Sultanate]] profited from trade in [[black pepper|pepper]] with the Dutch. This relationship declined by about 1770, and the sultanate had little contact with the Dutch for about sixty years.{{Citation needed |date=March 2011}}

In 1833, minor conflicts with the [[Dutch East Indies]] who were well established in Palembang, meant the Dutch increasingly felt the need to control the actions of Jambi. They coerced Sultan Facharudin to agree to greater Dutch presence in the region and control over trade, although the sultanate remained nominally independent. In 1858 the Dutch, concerned over the risk of competition for control from other foreign powers, invaded Jambi with a force from their capital [[Jakarta|Batavia]]. They met little resistance, and Sultan Taha fled upriver, to the inland regions of Jambi. The Dutch installed a puppet ruler, Nazarudin, in the lower region, which included the capital city. For the next forty years Taha maintained the upriver kingdom, and slowly reextended his influence over the lower regions through political agreements and marriage connections. In 1904, however, the Dutch were stronger and, as a part of a larger campaign to consolidate control over the entire archipelago,  managed to capture and kill Taha, and in 1906, the entire area was brought under direct colonial control.

Following the death of Jambi Sultan, Taha Saifuddin, on 27 April 1904 and the success of the Dutch controlled areas of the Sultanate of Jambi, Jambi then was set up as a Residency and entry into the territory Netherlands Indies. Jambi's first Resident OL Helfrich was appointed by the governor general under Dutch Decree No. 20, dated 4 May 1906, with his inauguration held on 2 July 1906.

In 1945, Sumatra comprised a single province, but in 1948 this was divided into three provinces, including the province of [[Central Sumatra]] (which included present-day Jambi Province). In 1957 this short-lived province was itself divided, and Jambi was created as an independent Province.

==Government and administrative divisions==
When Jambi Province was created in 1957, it comprised three regencies - [[Kerinci Regency|'''Kerinci''']] 
(renamed from South Pesisir Regency on 19 March 1956), [[Batang Hari Regency|'''Batanghari''']] and [[Bungo Regency|'''Bungo Tebo''']] - as well as the independent city of '''[[Jambi City]] '''. On 14 June 1965 two new regencies were formed - '''Sarolangun Bangko''' from part of Bungo Tebo Regency, and '''Tanjung Jabung''' from part of Batanghari Regency. On 4 October 1999 four additional regencies were created by splitting each of four existing regencies in two - '''Muara Jambi''' was formed from part of Batanghari Regency, while Sarolangun Bangko Regency was split into separate '''Sarolangun''' and '''Merangin''' Regencies, Tanjung Jabung Regency was split into separate '''Tanjung Jabung Barat''' (''West Tanjung Jabung'') and '''Tanjung Jabung Timur''' (''East Tanjung Jabung'') Regencies, and Bungo Tebo Regency was split into separate '''Bungo''' and '''Tebo''' Regencies. Finally, a second independent city of '''Sungai Penuh''' (''Penuh River'') was split off from Kerinci Regency on 1 July 2008.

Thus Jambi province is now divided into nine [[Regencies of Indonesia|regencies]] (''kabupaten'') and two [[Cities of Indonesia|cities]] (''kota''), listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011"/> and 2020<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> censuses, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Provinsi Jambi Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.15)</ref> These are divided into 141 districts (''kecamatan''), in turn sub-divided into 153 urban villages (''kelurahan'') and 1,399 rural villages (''desa'').

* [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds]]

May 2011: The Jambi provincial administration is striving to have the ancient Muaro Jambi [[Candi of Indonesia|temple site]] at Muaro Jambi village in [[Maro Sebo]] District, [[Muaro Jambi Regency]], recognized as a [[World Heritage Site]].

The site was a [[Buddhist]] education centre that flourished during the 7th and 8th centuries and is made from bricks similar to those used in Buddhist temples in [[India]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waspada.co.id/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=191402:provincial-govt-seeking-world-heritage-status-for-muaro-jambi-site&catid=30:english-news&Itemid=101|title=Waspada Online – Pusat Berita dan Informasi Medan Sumut Aceh|website=waspada.co.id|access-date=22 March 2018}}</ref>
