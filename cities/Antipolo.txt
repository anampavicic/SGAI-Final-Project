'''Antipolo''', officially the '''City of Antipolo''' ({{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Antipolo}}), is a 1st class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] and capital of the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]], [[Philippines]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/food-and-leisure/2017/08/04/1721046/6-reasons-why-living-antipolo-can-make-you-feel-top-world |title=6 reasons why living in Antipolo can make you feel on top of the world |work=The Philippine Star|access-date=November 5, 2019}}</ref> According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 887,399 people.{{PH census|current}} It is the most populous city in Rizal Province and in [[Calabarzon]] region, and the seventh most-populous city in the Philippines. It is also the most populated city under the component city status.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://philippinescities.com/region-4a-calabarzon-2/ |title=Region 4A (CALABARZON) {{!}} Philippines Cities |access-date=November 5, 2019}}</ref>

Its higher elevation than that of [[Metro Manila]] affords it a scenic view of the metropolitan area, especially at night. Its locally grown [[mango]]es and [[cashew]]s are popular among tourists, as well as [[Suman (food)|suman]] – a local delicacy made out of [[glutinous rice]]. The [[Hinulugang Taktak|Hinulugang Taktak National Park]], which was once a popular summer get-away is being restored to become again one of the city's primary attractions because it was devastated by a typhoon.<ref>[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090830-222660/Hinulugang-Taktak-gets-a-P100-M-makeover Inquirer.net – Hinulugang Taktak gets a P100-M makeover].

==Etymology==

[[File:Artocarpus camansi Blanco2.457.png|thumb|left|200px| ''Artocarpus camansi'', a close relative of the ''tipulo'' tree]]

The city was named after the [[breadfruit]] tree (''[[Artocarpus blancoi]]'') which in Tagalog is ''antipulo'' or ''tipulo'', which was in abundance in the area. It is highly similar to the ''kamansi'' plant or ''[[Artocarpus camansi]]''.

==History==
===Spanish colonial era===
[[Franciscan]] [[missionary|missionaries]] arrived in Antipolo in 1578, and built a small church on what is now [[Nuestra Señora Dela Annunciata Church (Antipolo)|Boso-Boso Church]]. They were soon replaced in 1591 by the [[Jesuit]]s, who organized the village into a parish. By 1601, The Christian population of Antipolo had grown to about 3,000 as the indigenous Dumagat population dwindled and moved deeper into the interiors.

An [[Philippine revolts against Spain#The Chinese Revolt of 1603|uprising]] of Manila's Chinese residents reached Antipolo in 1602. It led to the razing of the church.

On March 25, 1626, the image now known as the ''Virgin of Antipolo'' was brought from [[Acapulco]], [[New Spain]] (now Mexico) by [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Juan Niño de Tabora]], who relinquished the image to the Jesuits for Antipolo's church.

In 1650, the village was organized into a town and became part of Tondo Province. When the province was divided in 1853, Antipolo became a part of the District of San Mateo de los Montes, which later became the [[Morong (district)|District of Morong]].

Later in the 1700s, discharged soldiers and deserters (from Mexico, Spain and Peru) were providing Indios military training for the weapons that had been disseminated all over the territory during the British Occupation of Manila as they disperesed across the provinces surrounding Manila, uncluding Antipolo, Rizal.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/36911506/Eva_Maria_Mehl_Forced_migration_in_the_Spanish_pacific_world_From_Mexico_to_the_Philippines_1765-1811?auto=download "Eva Maria Mehl: Forced migration in the Spanish pacific world: From Mexico to the Philippines, 1765–1811" Page 100.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220516010924/https://www.academia.edu/36911506/Eva_Maria_Mehl_Forced_migration_in_the_Spanish_pacific_world_From_Mexico_to_the_Philippines_1765-1811?auto=download |date=May 16, 2022 }} From the original Spanish language source in the archives of Mexico: "CSIC ser. Consultas riel 208 leg.14 (1774)"</ref> 

The Recollects took over Antipolo in 1864. It was during these years that the Virgin of Antipolo gained a following of devotees. Devotees from Manila and nearby towns and provinces flocked to Antipolo on foot or on [[hammock]]s, trekking along mountain trails and springs.

===American invasion era===
During the [[First Philippine Republic|First Republic]], the town served as the capital of Morong, until it was occupied by the [[United States|America]]ns on June 4, 1899; the Revolutionary Government then transferred Morong's capital to [[Tanay, Rizal|Tanay]]. Soon after, the Americans established a civil government in 1901, Valentin Sumulong became the first municipal president. On June 11, 1901, Antipolo was incorporated into the newly established Province of Rizal, which included towns of Morong District and [[Manila (province)|Manila Province]]. In 1903, the nearby towns of Bosoboso and [[Teresa, Rizal|Teresa]] were merged with Antipolo.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l89ad|number=942|date=October 12, 1903|accessdate=June 18, 2022|title=An Act Reducing the Thirty-Two Municipalities of the Province of Rizal to Fifteen}}</ref> The town's territory was expanded again in 1913 to add the [[sitio]]s of Mayamot and Bulao; just to lose Teresa six years later to become an independent municipality. The Manila Railroad Company (currently [[Philippine National Railways]]) inaugurated a railway service to Antipolo on December 24, 1908.

Long before the [[LRT Line 2]] finally opened its services in Santolan in the [[Pasig]]-[[Marikina]] border in 2004, steam train services had once served those places in the past, even before World War II.

In Marikina, there is a street named "Daangbakal", also called by the names of "Shoe Avenue Extension", "Munding Avenue" and "Bagong Silang". There is also a similar "Daangbakal" in the [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]]-Montalban ([[Rodriguez, Rizal|Rodriguez]]) area, and on the maps one can notice that the two roads should have been connected with each other. In fact, as the name suggests in Tagalog, these streets were once a single railway line. The two sides of the "Daangbakal" roads were once connected by a bridge in the San Mateo-Marikina border. However, as the railroad tracks have been largely ignored after the Japanese occupation and was transformed into separate highways, the railway connection was abandoned.

The old railroad tracks, called the Marikina Line, were connected from [[Tutuban station]] in [[Manila]], passing through Tramo (Barangay Rosario, Pasig) coming all the way to the town of Marikina up to Montalban. On the northern end of the "Daangbakal" road in Montalban is a basketball court. That basketball court which stands today, surrounded by the Montalban Catholic Church and Cemetery, was once the railway station terminus of that particular line.

The present-day Santo Niño Elementary School in Marikina was said to be a train depot. And also it was said that a railroad station once stood in the Marikina City Sports Park.

The Marikina Line was completed in 1906, and continued its operation until 1936. It was said that the Japanese Imperial Army made use of this railway line during the Second World War. These railways were dismantled during the 1960s and were converted into ordinary roads.

Today, the citizens are dependent on [[tricycles]], [[jeepneys]], taxis, [[UV Express]] services, buses and AUVs, which contribute to the everyday unbearable traffic of Metropolitan Manila. Even now there is uncertainty concerning the Northrail project, which is to link Manila to the northern provinces of [[Luzon]], owing to corruption within the project's construction.

[[File:Daangbakal (Taktak) Road, Antipolo City.jpg|thumb|left|200px| Daangbakal Road, interchangeably ''Taktak'' Road. The Remains of the terminus of the former railway line is situated near the Hinulugang Taktak falls.]]

Aside from the Marikina Line, two other lines have existed before but are now removed permanently. These are the [[Cavite]] Line, which passed through [[Paco railway station|Paco]], [[Parañaque]], [[Bacoor]] and up to [[Naic]], Cavite. Completed in 1908, its operation continued until 1936. The other is the Antipolo Line, which passed through [[Santa Mesa railway station|Santa Mesa]], [[Mandaluyong]], [[Pasig]], [[Cainta]], [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]], up to Antipolo near the "[[Hinulugang Taktak]]" Falls. Its operation ceased in 1917. There is a street named "Daangbakal" in Antipolo; there, as with the "Daangbakal" roads on [[Marikina]] and [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]], a railway line once existed. The railroad tracks also passed through what is now the [[Ortigas Avenue]] Extension.

===Japanese occupation era===
During the start of the [[Second World War]] in the Philippines, Antipolo became a refugee destination for many citizens from [[Manila]] and its suburbs who sought to avoid the Japanese invaders vying to occupy the Philippine capital. Also, two guerrilla units operated in the town against the Japanese. They were the [[Hunters ROTC]] under Miguel Ver and Terry Adevoso and the Marking Filipino and American Troops, which were established and led by Marcos Villa Agustin, more popularly known under the name Brig. Gen. Agustin Marking. Many inhabitants were tortured and killed by the Japanese, including Mayor Pascual Oliveros and his son Reynaldo, Padre Eusebio Carreon, Padre Ariston Ocampo, Sis. Ma. Elizabeth Cagulanas, RVM, Sis. Ma. Consuelo Recio, RVM; Ambrosio Masangkay, Alfonso Oliveros and Atty. Francisco C. Gedang Sr.

The [[Battle_of_Wawa_Dam#Liberation_of_Antipolo|liberation of Antipolo]] from the Japanese forces was bloody and devastating. On February 17, 1945, Mambugan, Antipolo was heavily bombarded by American planes. Antipolo residents evacuated to Sitio Colaique and up to the towns of [[Angono, Rizal|Angono]], Santolan and [[Marikina]]. To protect the image from being destroyed, Procopio Angeles, then the sacristan mayor, and members of the community brought with them the Virgin of Antipolo. The bombings on March 6–7, 1945, destroyed the church, and after twelve days of battle, the combined American and Filipino soldiers under the [[United States Army]], [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] and [[Philippine Constabulary]] and aided the local recognized guerrillas of the [[Hunters ROTC]] and Marking's Filipino-American Troops (MFAT) liberated the town on March 12, 1945. The general headquarters of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] and [[Philippine Constabulary]] was stationed in Antipolo from March 1945 to June 1946 was built today and operates during and after the war was fought the Japanese and they helping guerrillas and Allies. After the war, a temporary church was built and the Virgin of Antipolo was returned from the [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]] Church on October 15, 1945.

===Philippine independence===
Religious devotees began to flock to the town, and on May 6, 1947, the first procession of the Virgin of Antipolo was held, starting at the hills of Pinagmisahan. In the following year, a national committee was formed to undertake a nationwide fund-raising campaign to rebuild the [[Antipolo Cathedral|Cathedral of Antipolo]].

On June 15, 1952, [[Hinulugang Taktak]] was proclaimed a [[National Park]] by [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Elpidio Quirino]], and on January 14, 1954, the Bishops of the [[Philippines]] proclaimed the [[Antipolo Cathedral|Antipolo Church]] as the national shrine of the Virgin of Antipolo.

In the 1960s the town proper, or ''poblacion'', was widened and the Sumulong Highway was constructed. In the 1970s, the [[Marikina–Infanta Highway|Marikina–Infanta Road]], better known as the Marcos Highway, was constructed, traversing the mountains of Antipolo.

The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Antipolo]] was created on June 25, 1983, with Rev. Protacio G. Gungon, D.D. as the first bishop of the diocese.

===Provincial capital===
On March 4, 2009, a new capitol building was inaugurated in the city to replace the old capitol in [[Pasig]].<ref>[http://philippinerealestatenews.blogspot.com/2009/03/board-wants-antipolo-officially-named.html Board wants Antipolo officially named capital of Rizal]. ''Retrieved October 23, 2009''.</ref>

On June 19, 2020, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] signed Republic Act No. 11475, designating Antipolo City as the official capital of Rizal province, replacing Pasig that held the title since the province's creation in 1901 even after its incorporation to [[Metro Manila]] in 1975. It took effect on July 7, 2020.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1295579/duterte-transfers-capital-seat-of-rizal-from-pasig-city-to-antipolo-city|title=Duterte transfers capital, seat of gov't of Rizal from Pasig City to Antipolo City|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|last=Aguilar|first=Krissy|date=June 22, 2020|access-date=June 22, 2020}}</ref>

Antipolo is landlocked; it is bounded to the north by [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]] and [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Rodriguez]], to the east by [[Tanay, Rizal|Tanay]], to the south by [[Angono, Rizal|Angono]], [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]] and [[Teresa, Rizal|Teresa]], and to the west by [[Cainta, Rizal|Cainta]] and [[Marikina]] in [[Metro Manila]].

The Bitukang Manok of [[Pasig]]—also known as the Parian Creek—had once linked the [[Marikina River]] with the Antipolo River before the [[Manggahan Floodway]] was built in 1986.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.mb.com.ph/2018/09/25/dpwhs-villar-moves-closer-to-building-10-bridges-in-mm |title=DPWH's Villar moves closer to building 10 bridges in MM |work=Manila Bulletin |access-date=November 5, 2019 |archive-date=November 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105095956/https://news.mb.com.ph/2018/09/25/dpwhs-villar-moves-closer-to-building-10-bridges-in-mm/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Parian Creek was actually connected to the Sapang Bato-Buli Creek (which serves as the boundary between Pasig's barangays Dela Paz-Manggahan-Rosario-Santa Lucia and the Municipality of [[Cainta]]), the Kasibulan Creek (situated at Vista Verde, Barangay San Isidro, Cainta), the Palanas Creek (leaving Antipolo through Barangay Muntindilao), the Bulaw Creek (on Barangay Mambungan, besides the Valley Golf and Country Club), and the "[[Hinulugang Taktak]]" Falls of Barangay Dela Paz (fed by the Taktak Creek passing close to the Antipolo town square), thus being the detached and long-abandoned Antipolo River.

From the early 17th century up to the period of [[Japanese imperialism]], over a thousand [[Catholic]] devotees coming from "Maynilad" ([[Manila]]), "Hacienda Pineda" ([[Pasay]]), "[[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] del Monte", "[[Hacienda]] de Mandaloyon" ([[Mandaluyong]]), "Hacienda Mariquina" ([[Marikina]]), "[[Barrio]] [[Pateros]]", "[[Pueblo]] de Tagig" ([[Taguig]]), and "San Pedro de Macati" ([[Makati]]), followed the trail of the Parian Creek to the [[Pilgrimage]] [[Cathedral]] on the mountainous pueblo of Antipolo, [[Morong, Rizal|Morong]] (the present-day [[Rizal Province]]).

The Antipoleños and several locals from the far-reached barrios of "[[Poblacion]] de San Mateo", "Montalban" ([[Rodriguez, Rizal|Rodriguez]]), "Monte de Tan-ay" ([[Tanay, Rizal|Tanay]]), "Santa Rosa-Oroquieta" ([[Teresa, Rizal|Teresa]]), and "Punta Ibayo" ([[Baras, Rizal|Baras]]), had also navigated this freshwater creek once to go down to the vast "Kapatagan" (Rice plains) of lowland Pasig. Even the [[marian devotions|marian]] [[processions]] of the [[Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage]] passed this route back and forth eleven times.

The creek was also used during the [[British occupation of Manila]] from 1762 to 1764 by the [[British Army]], under the leadership of General [[William Draper (British Army officer)|William Draper]] and [[Vice Admiral]] [[Sir Samuel Cornish, 1st Baronet]], to transport their troops upstream to take over the nearby forest-surrounded villages of Cainta and [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]]. They even did an ambush at the "Plaza Central" in front of the [[Pasig Cathedral]], and turned the [[Roman Catholic]] parish into their military headquarters, with the church's fortress-like "campanilla" ([[belfry (architecture)|belfry]]) serving as a [[watchtower]] against Spanish defenders sailing from the walled city of [[Intramuros|Manila]] via the [[Pasig River]].

The Sepoys turned against their [[Great Britain|British]] lieutenants and sided with the combined forces of the Spanish overseas officials (assigned by the Governor-General [[Simon de Anda y Salazar]]), Filipino rice farmers, fisherfolk, and Chinese traders.

[[File:Antipolo City Hall.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Facade of City Hall]] 
[[File:Antipolo City Hall Annex Building.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The newly-built City Hall Annex building, adjacent to the old City Hall]]
As a component city and the capital of the Province of Rizal, government officials in the provincial level are voted by the electorates of the city. The provincial government have political jurisdiction over local transactions of the city government.

Similar to other cities in the Philippines, the government structure of Antipolo is prescribed in the Local Government Code of 1991, and further codified in its city charter. It is headed by a city mayor, who serves as its chief executive and exercises overall supervision of its administrative agencies.

Its second-highest official, the city [[vice mayor]], primarily serves as [[Chairman|presiding officer]] of the [[Sangguniang Panlungsod]] and assumes the position of city mayor in the event of its vacancy. As presiding officer of the Sangguniang Panlungsod, the vice mayor does not vote except in cases to break a tie.

The city's Sangguniang Panlungsod or city council is composed of 16 elected members, two ''ex officio'' officers and an option to have at most three sectoral representatives. The 16 barangays Antipolo is divided into are grouped into two districts. Each of these districts elect at-large eight city councilors, while the two ''ex officio'' officers are the city's [[Liga ng mga Barangay]] president and [[Sangguniang Kabataan#SK Federations|Sangguniang Kabataan Federation]] president.

Apart from legislating city ordinances, it also reviews the ordinances enacted by its barangays and makes recommendations for modification if they are found to be inconsistent with existing laws and city ordinances. On the other hand, ordinances and certain resolutions of the Sangguniang Panlungsod are transmitted to the [[Sangguniang Panlalawigan]] of Rizal for compliance review.

Barangays are also headed by elected officials: [[Barangay Captain]], [[Sangguniang Barangay|Barangay Council]], whose members are called [[Barangay Kagawad|Barangay Councilors]]. The barangays have SK federation which represents the barangay, headed by SK chairperson and whose members are called SK councilors.

Elective city officials serve a term of three years and may serve up to three consecutive terms.

===Congress representation===
Antipolo's barangays are grouped into two [[Legislative districts of Antipolo City|legislative districts]]. Each district elects eight members to its [[Sangguniang Panlalawigan]] and one each to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]].<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=RA|number=9232|title=An Act Amending Sections 2, 11 (a) and 55 of Republic Act Numbered Eighty-five Hundred and Eight Entitled "an Act Converting the Municipality of Antipolo Into a Component City to Be Known as the City of Antipolo." and Appropriating Funds Therefor|date=December 22, 2003|url=http://www.ops.gov.ph/records/ra_no9232.htm |access-date=October 15, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120225343/http://www.ops.gov.ph/records/ra_no9232.htm |archive-date=January 20, 2009}}</ref>
