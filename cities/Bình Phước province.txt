'''Bình Phước''' is a [[Provinces of Vietnam|province]] of [[Vietnam]]. It is located in the [[Southeast (Vietnam)|Southeast region]] of the country, to the north of [[Ho Chi Minh City|Hồ Chí Minh City]] (formerly Saigon). It shares a border with [[Cambodia]].

==History==
Bình Phước province is the result of a merger of two former provinces: [[Phước Long province]] and [[Bình Long province]], which existed before reunification.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Both Phước Long and Bình Long then became part of [[Sông Bé province]] in 1976, which also included [[Bình Dương province]]. Sông Bé province was dissolved in 1997 and Bình Phước again became a separate province. Several significant battles were fought in what is now Bình Phước province. These include the [[Battle of Sông Bé]] in May 1965, the [[Battle of Đồng Xoài]] in June 1965, the [[Battle of Loc Ninh|Battle of Lộc Ninh]] in April 1972, and the [[Battle of Phước Long]] from December 1974 to January 1975. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Geography==
Bình Phước province is relatively flat with an elevation of between {{convert|50|m|ft}} and {{convert|200|m|ft}} throughout most of the province. The elevation is gradually higher towards the east of the province and reach around {{convert|500|m|ft}} near parts of the border with [[Đắk Nông province]] of the [[Central Highlands, Vietnam|Central Highlands]]. The highest elevation is [[Bà Rá mountain]] ({{convert|736|m|ft}}) in the centre of the province.<ref name="atlat">''Atlat Dia li Viet Nam'' (Geographical Atlas of Vietnam). NXB Giao Duc, Hanoi: 2010</ref> There are several hills around the province with heights of up to around {{convert|200|m|ft}} in the west and {{convert|300|m|ft}} in the southeast.<ref name="VAA">''Vietnam Administrative Atlas''. Cartographic Publishing House, Hanoi 2010</ref>

Most of the rivers in the province are tributaries of the [[Bé River]], which in turn is a tributary of the [[Đồng Nai River]].<ref name="atlat"/> [[Thác Mơ Hydroelectric Power Plant|Thác Mơ lake]] is a large artificial lake in the east of the province. Several rivers originating in the Central Highlands flow into it, including Đak G'lun, Đăk Nhau, Đắk R'lấp, and Dak Oa (from north to south).<ref name="VAA"/> It is the point of origin of the Bé River, which flows through much of central and western Bình Phước.

Forestry land takes up {{convert|337,000|ha|acre|-1}} or 49 percent of the province's total area.<ref name="GSO09">General Statistics Office (2009): ''Socio-economic Statistical Data of 63 Provinces and Cities, Vietnam''. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi.</ref> Forests are located mostly in the northeast and southeast of the province as well as along the northern border with [[Cambodia]] and the western border with [[Tây Ninh province]].<ref name="atlat"/> Much of the rest of the area is used to grow perennial cash crops. The total agricultural area is {{convert|293,700|ha|acre|-1}}. There are {{convert|21,900|ha|acre}} of specially used land and {{convert|5700|ha|acre}} of residential land.<ref name="GSO09"/>

==Demography==
Bình Phước's population in 2022 was 1,277,300. This is a significant increase from 684,600 in 2000. In contrast to many other provinces, much of this growth has taken place in rural areas, where the population increased by 118,500 compared to 20,500 in urban areas. Bình Phước is a predominantly rural province, with only 15.4 percent of the population living in towns. The population has grown by 16.5 percent between 2000 and 2005, but has since slowed to 2.23 percent in 2006 and 1 percent in 2007.<ref name="GSO09"/>

Besides the majority [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], there are minorities of [[Stieng people|Xtiêng]], [[Nung people|Nùng]], [[Tay people|Tày]], and [[Khmer Krom|Khmer]]. Ethnic minorities are present throughout the province.<ref name="atlat"/>

==Administrative divisions==
Bình Phước is subdivided into 11 district-level sub-divisions:

* 7 districts:

==Economy==
Bình Phước is agriculturally one of the most productive provinces of Vietnam, especially relying on cash crops such as cashew nuts and rubber. As of 2007, its agricultural [[gross domestic product|gross domestic product (GDP)]] per capita was 7.03 million [[Vietnamese đồng]]s, the highest in Vietnam, while industrial GDP per capita was only 1.7 million đồngs, making it one of the least industrialized provinces in the southern half of Vietnam. Bình Phước's GDP in 2007 was 9,534.4 billion đồngs or 11.58 million đồngs per capita, which is 86 percent of the national figure and significantly lower than that of the other provinces in the [[Đông Nam Bộ|Southeastern]] region. Growth in GDP has been between 14% and 15% per year from 2000 to 2007. Bình Phước exported goods with a value of US$325.5 million in 2007, far exceeding its imports of US$57.4 million. Since 2000, exports have increased almost sevenfold while imports increased almost tenfold. The main export products include rubber latex, shelled cashew nuts and pepper.<ref name="GSO09"/>

===Ownership structure===
The state sector accounted for 41.5 percent of GDP in 2007, an increase from the 29.5 percent in 2000 but somewhat lower than 2006, when its share peaked at 45.9 percent. At the same time, the household sector had seen its share being reduced from 61.1 percent in 2000 to 49.2 percent in 2007, but it was still the largest ownership sector in Bình Phước. The private sector is still very small at only 7.7 percent of GDP. There has been very little foreign investment; this sector contributes only 1.4 percent to the province's GDP.<ref name="GSO09"/>

===Agriculture===
Agriculture in Bình Phước is dominated by perennial crops, mainly cashew nuts, rubber, coffee and pepper. 4,333 of the 4,458 farms in 2007 were perennial crop farms. The production of cereals is much less significant and accounts only for a small part of agricultural area and output. 34,200 tons of rice and 19.7 tons of maize were harvested in 2007, accounting for only 0.1 and 0.5 percent of the national output. Sweet potatoes and cassava are also grown in Bình Phước. The most important cash crop is [[cashew nut]]s. 156,377 tons of cashew nuts were harvested in 2007, accounting for 51.8 percent of the national output. This is a significant increase from 110,000 tons in 2006 and just 19,000 tons in 2000.<ref name="GSO09"/> Cashew nuts are grown mostly in the east and south of the province, roughly along (north and west of) National Route 14.<ref name="atlat"/> Cashew nuts are an important export product for Bình Phước as well as Vietnam in general. Exports in 2010 are expected to reach US$1 billion, while there are also increasing imports of raw cashew nuts because processing capacity by now significantly exceeds the quantity grown in Vietnam.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.intellasia.net/news/articles/agriculture/111306558.shtml# |title=Local cashew nut's export-import turnover may reach $1b. Intellasia {{!}} VOV. 19 October 2010 |access-date=2010-11-10 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110723155857/http://www.intellasia.net/news/articles/agriculture/111306558.shtml# |archive-date=2011-07-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Another important crop is rubber, with 147,520 tons produced in 2007. This accounts for 24.5 percent of the national output and has more than doubled since 2000 (67,000 tons).<ref name="GSO09"/> Rubber is mostly produced in the north and west of the province, along the [[Bé River]] and [[National Route 13 (Vietnam)|National Route 13]].<ref name="atlat"/> Bình Phước's pepper production also accounts for a significant share of national output (24 percent). Production has more than doubled to 21,736 between 2000 and 2007.<ref name="GSO09"/> Pepper is grown in the southwest of the province in the districts of [[Bình Long Town|Bình Long]] and [[Chơn Thành District|Chơn Thành]], between National Route 13 and the Bé River.<ref name="atlat"/>

Coffee is grown in the northeast of the province, north of Thác Mơ Lake.<ref name="atlat"/> 56,148 tons of coffee were harvested in 2007, accounting for 5.8 percent of the national output.<ref name="GSO09"/> Other crops include coconuts (877 tons in 2007), sugar cane (28,800 tons), peanuts (800 tons) and cotton (500 tons).

===Industry===
Industry and construction contribute only 14.7 percent to the province's GDP as of 2007. However, it has contributed significantly to recent economic growth. While the large agricultural sector has been growing by around 10 percent from 2005 to 2007, the growth of industry and construction was 35.8, 25.9, and 21.6 percent in these three years, respectively.<ref name="GSO09"/>

Many of the industries are based on agricultural products or raw materials. Food processing industries include the production of shelled cashew nuts (29,200 tons) and cassava starch (78,100 tons). There is also an industry producing hand farming tools. Other industries include construction materials (stones and bricks) and forest product processing (saw wood and paper).<ref name="GSO09"/>

==Transportation==
In September 2007, moves were made to consider the construction of a section of the proposed [[Trans-Asian Railway]] from [[Dĩ An]] on the main north-south line to [[Lộc Ninh, Bình Phước|Lộc Ninh]] near the [[Transport in Cambodia|Cambodia]]n border.
