[[Eurostat]] and [[OECD]] have used a definition for the [[Metropolitan area]] of Odense (referred to as a ''[[Functional urban area]]''), which includes all municipalities in the [[Province]] (Danish: [[Provinces of Denmark|''landsdel'']]) of Funen (Danish: ''Fyn''), with a total population of 504,066 as of 1 July 2022.<ref name="EurostatFUA2"/><ref name=OECDDefFUA/><ref>{{Cite web |title=Befolkningstal |url=https://www.dst.dk/da/Statistik/emner/borgere/befolkning/befolkningstal |access-date=28 August 2022 |website=www.dst.dk |language=da}}</ref>

By road, Odense is located {{convert|45|km}} north of [[Svendborg]], {{convert|144|km}} to the south of [[Aarhus]] and {{convert|167|km}} to the southwest of the capital [[Copenhagen]]. The city was the seat of [[Odense County]] until 1970, and [[Funen County]] from 1970 until 1 January 2007, when Funen County became part of the [[Region of Southern Denmark]]. Odense has close associations with [[Hans Christian Andersen]] who is remembered above all for his [[fairy tale]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/writer/hans-christian-andersen|title = Hans Christian Andersen| date=9 November 2021 }}</ref> He was born in the city in 1805 and spent his childhood years there.

There has been human settlement in the Odense area for over 4,000 years, although the name was not mentioned in writing until 988, and by 1070, it had already grown into a thriving city. [[Canute IV of Denmark]], generally considered to be the last [[Viking]] king, was murdered by unruly peasants in Odense's [[St. Canute's Abbey, Odense|St Alban's Priory]] on 10 July 1086. Although the city was burned in 1249 following a royal rivalry, it quickly recovered and flourished as a centre of commerce in the [[Middle Ages]]. After a period of decline, large-scale plans for development were made during the 18th century, which led to the rebuilding of [[Odense Palace]] and the building of a canal to the [[Port of Odense]], facilitating trade. In 1865, one of the largest railway terminals in Denmark was built, further increasing the population and commerce, and by 1900, Odense had reached a population of 35,000. Odense's [[Odinstårnet]] was one of the tallest towers in Europe when built in 1935 but was destroyed by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] during [[World War II]]. The [[University of Southern Denmark]] was established in 1966.

In the present day, Odense remains the commercial hub of [[Funen]], and has a notable shopping district with a diversity of stores. Several major industries are located in the city including the [[Albani Brewery]] and [[GASA]], Denmark's major dealer in vegetables, fruits and flowers. The city is home to Odense Palace, erected by King [[Frederick IV of Denmark|Frederik IV]] who died there in 1730, the [[Odense Theatre]], the [[Odense Symphony Orchestra]], and the [[Hans Christian Andersen Museum]], situated in the house that was the birthplace of Hans Christian Andersen. In sports, Odense has a number of football clubs including [[Odense BK|OB]], [[Boldklubben Marienlyst|BM]], [[Boldklubben 1909|B1909]], and [[Boldklubben 1913|B1913]], the [[Odense Bulldogs]] professional [[ice hockey]] team, and the city also hosts the [[H.C. Andersen Marathon]]. Odense is served by [[Hans Christian Andersen Airport]] and [[Odense station]], which lies on the line between Copenhagen and the [[Jutland]] peninsula.

== Etymology ==

The name Odense is derived from ''Odins [[Vé (shrine)|vé]]'', meaning "Odin's sanctuary", as the area was known as a sanctuary for worshippers of the [[Norse mythology|Nordic god]], [[Odin]].<ref name="dnet">{{cite web|url=http://www.danishnet.com/info.php/travel/odense-24.html|title=Odense, Denmark|publisher=Danishnet.com|access-date=28 June 2014}}</ref>

== History ==
: ''For the Catholic ecclesiastical history, see [[Roman Catholic bishopric of Odense]]''

===Early history===

Odense is one of Denmark's oldest cities. Archaeological excavations in the vicinity show proof of settlement for over 4,000 years since at least the [[Stone Age]].{{sfn|Renouf|2003|p=58}}<ref name="dnet"/> The earliest community was centred on the higher ground between the [[Odense River]] to the south and [[Naesbyhoved Lake]] (now dry) to the north. [[Nonnebakken]], one of Denmark's former [[Viking ring fortress]]es, lay to the south of the river.<ref name=historienshus>{{cite web|url=http://www.historienshus.dk/odenses%20historie|title=Begyndelsen|publisher=Historiens Hus Odense|access-date=26 June 2014|language=da|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714145924/http://www.historienshus.dk/odenses%20historie|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Today, Odense's Møntergården Museum has many artefacts related to the early Viking history in the Odense area.{{sfn|Harding|2009|p=73}} The Vikings built numerous fortifications along the river banks to defend it against invaders coming in from the coast.{{sfn|Renouf|2003|p=58}}

[[File:Skt. Knud den Hellige.JPG|thumb|left|upright| [[Canute IV of Denmark]], generally considered to be the last Viking king, was murdered by unruly peasants in Odense in 1086]]

The city celebrated its thousandth anniversary in 1988, commemorating the first mention of the town's name in a letter dated 18 March 988 from the German emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] which granted rights to Odense and neighbouring settlements.<ref name=museum>{{cite web|url=http://museum.odense.dk/viden/historie/odenses-historie/odense-bys-historie|title=Odense Bys Historie|publisher=Odense Bys Museer|access-date=27 June 2014|language=da|archive-date=15 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715000213/http://museum.odense.dk/viden/historie/odenses-historie/odense-bys-historie|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first church in Odense appears to have been [[St Mary's Church, Odense|St Mary's]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/16064d.htm|title=Ancient See of Odense in Denmark|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia at New Advent|access-date=28 June 2014 }}</ref> probably built in the late 12th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://danmarkskirker.natmus.dk/uploads/tx_tcchurchsearch/Odense_1013-1220.pdf|title=Vor Frue Kirke|publisher=Danmarks Kirker, Nationalmuseet|access-date=28 June 2014 |language=da}}</ref> The territory, previously part of the vast [[Archbishopric of Hamburg]], was created a [[Roman Catholic bishopric of Odense|Catholic diocese]] in 988. The first recorded bishops of Odense were Odinkar Hvide and [[Reginbert of Odense|Reginbert]], who was consecrated by Archbishop [[Æthelnoth (archbishop of Canterbury)|Æthelnoth]] of [[Archbishopric of Canterbury|Canterbury]], in 1022.{{sfn|Larson|2014|p=136}}

Recent excavations have shown that from the early 11th century, the town developed in the area around Albani Torv, Fisketorvet, Overgade and Vestergade.<ref name=historienshus/> By 1070, Odense had already grown into a city of stature in Denmark.<ref name="dnet"/> [[Canute IV of Denmark]], generally considered to be the last Viking king, was murdered by unruly peasants, discontent with the high taxes he imposed on the town, in Odense's [[St. Canute's Abbey, Odense|St Alban's Priory]] on 10 July 1086.<ref name="dnet"/> He was canonized in 1100.<ref name=dsd>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Fyn/Fyn_-_byer/Odense/Odense_%28Historie%29|title=Odense – historie|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|access-date=26 June 2014 |language=da}}</ref> The priory no longer exists, although a church has been situated on the site since about 900. At the beginning of the 12th century, Benedictine monks from England founded St Canute's Abbey. It was here the English monk [[Ælnoth of Canterbury|Ælnoth]] wrote Denmark's first literary work, ''Vita et Passio S. Canuti'' (The Life and Passion of St Canute).<ref name=dsd/> Canute's shrine in Odense Cathedral (which was attached to the priory) attracted pilgrims throughout the Middle Ages.<ref name="Britannica">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/425058/Odense|title=Odense|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=26 June 2014}}</ref>

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Braunius Odense.jpg|thumb|right|Braunius map of Odense from 1593]]
In the Middle Ages, a number of churches and monasteries were built in the town. [[St. Canute's Cathedral|St Canute's Church]] (''Skt. Knuds Kirke''), now the cathedral, dates from the end of the 13th century and was closely connected to the [[Benedictine Order]]. The town's other old churches are St Mary's (''Vor Frue Kirke'') and St John's (''Skt. Hans Kirke'') with its adjacent monastery. Greyfriars Monastery (''Gråbrødre Kloster'') was founded by the [[Franciscan Order|Franciscans]] in 1279.<ref name=museum/>

In 1247 Odense was burned by [[Abel, King of Denmark|Abel of Denmark]] during conflicts with his brother [[Eric IV of Denmark|King Erik IV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dengang.dk/abel-og-hans-soenner/|title=Abel og hans sønner|publisher=Dengang.dk|access-date=28 June 2014 |language=da}}</ref> The cathedral had to be completely rebuilt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://museum.odense.dk/boern-unge/boern-unge/undervisning/moentergaarden/tro-mord-kaerlighed/faktaportal/13-skt-knuds-kirke|title=Snt Knuds Kirke|publisher=Odense Bys Museer|access-date=28 June 2014|language=da|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140721074457/http://museum.odense.dk/boern-unge/boern-unge/undervisning/moentergaarden/tro-mord-kaerlighed/faktaportal/13-skt-knuds-kirke|archive-date=21 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Nevertheless, the town continued to flourish as a commercial centre, and was charted in 1335.<ref name="Britannica"/> The city thrived economically during the Middle Ages, attracting many merchants and craftsman who traded their goods.{{sfn|Renouf|2003|p=58}}

In 1482 Bishop Karl Rønnov brought the German printer [[Johann Snell]] to Odense to print a short prayer book, ''Breviarium Ottoniense'', considered to be the first work to be printed in Scandinavia. In parallel Snell printed ''De obsidione et bello Rhodiano'', an account of the Turkish siege of the island of [[Rhodes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/1001fortaellinger/en_GB/johan-snell-s-printing-works|title=John Snell's Printing Works|publisher=Kulturarv|access-date=27 June 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Bog-_og_biblioteksv%C3%A6sen/Boghistorie_og_bogtryk/Johann_Snell|title=Johann Snell|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|access-date=27 June 2014 }}</ref>

After the [[Danish Reformation]], involving the suppression of the Catholic bishopric in 1536, the city enjoyed a sustained period of prosperity from the 1530s to the mid-17th century, becoming northern Funen's commercial centre. One of the main sources of income was the sale of cattle, providing substantial funds for the construction of fine [[half-timbered]] houses for the local merchants. The local nobility also participated in the city's development by building residences where they spent the winter months. But the city's prosperity came to an abrupt end in the late 1650s heavy taxes were imposed after the end of the [[Dano-Swedish War (1657–58)|Swedish Wars]]. A period of stagnation ensued until the end of the 18th century.<ref name=dsd/>

From the 16th century the town was the meeting-place of several parliaments, and until 1805 Odense was the seat of the provincial assembly of Funen.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Odense|volume=20|page=2}}</ref> By 1700 Odense's population was about 4,000.{{sfn|Renouf|2003|p=58}}

===Development===
[[File:Denmark-odense-hans christian andersen-childhood home.jpg|thumb|Hans Christian Andersen's childhood home]]
Dramatic changes began in Odense in the 18th century to modernise the city and a great plan was drawn up for development. In 1720, Frederick IV ordered the rebuilding of Odense Palace, partly on the foundations of the 13th century [[St. Hans’s Monastery]], and the construction of St Hans’s Church by the [[Knights Hospitallers]].<ref name="Britannica"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jmarcussen.dk/historie/Religion/orden/johanitter.html|title=Johanniterordenen|date=18 November 2003|publisher=Maritim og historisk information|access-date=28 June 2014 |language=da}}</ref> An 8 kilometre (5.0&nbsp;mi) long, 7.5 metre (25&nbsp;ft) deep canal from [[Odense Harbour]] to [[Odense Fjord]] was built between 1796 and 1806 to facilitate the growth of Odense as a port city, radically increasing its level of trade and population.<ref name="dnet"/>{{sfn|Thestrup|Andersen|Oxenvad|1986|pp=193–200}} Founded in 1796, [[Odense Teater]] is the first provincial theatre in Denmark and the country's second oldest.<ref name=hoo/><ref name=dsdodense>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Teater/Danske_teatre/Odense_Teater|title=Odense Teater|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|date=17 April 2012 |access-date=29 June 2014 |language=da}}</ref> [[Odense Central Library]] was established in 1924 and removed to [[Odense station]] in 1995.<ref name="Dewe2012">{{cite book|last=Dewe|first=Mr Michael|title=Planning Public Library Buildings: Concepts and Issues for the Librarian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sARvKM5rynkC&pg=PA150|date=1 October 2012|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-8501-8|pages=150–}}</ref> The [[Odense Music Library]] contains Denmark's largest collection of phonograms.<ref name=soundart>{{cite web|title=Vision for Odense Music Library|url=http://www.soundart.dk/vgsite.data/Components/vangogh6visionUK.pdf|publisher=Sound Art|access-date=13 July 2014|date=April 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613003214/http://www.soundart.dk/vgsite.data/Components/vangogh6visionUK.pdf|archive-date=13 June 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

From the 1840s, the city enjoyed a period of rapid expansion beyond its traditional boundaries, becoming Denmark's second largest city. The city gates were demolished in 1851 and soon afterwards development extended to the area south of the river. Glove production, which had begun in the 18th century, developed into one of the most important industries while the harbour facilities were further expanded.<ref name=byport/> In 1853 Denmark's first modern water and gas works were opened in Odense.<ref name=dsd/> Commerce was further boosted by the building of a railway across Funen in 1865, and Odense became one of Denmark's largest rail junctions.<ref name="dnet"/>{{sfn|Renouf|2003|p=58}} All this provided an ideal basis for industrialisation, attracting a wide range of industries including iron and metals, textiles, and food and beverages. Separate areas of the city were devoted to increased industrial and residential expansion,<ref name=hoo>{{cite web|url=http://www.odense.dk/subsites5/english/topmenu/about/a%20history%20of%20odense|title=A History of Odense|publisher=Odense Kommune|access-date=29 June 2014|archive-date=20 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720215336/http://www.odense.dk/subsites5/english/topmenu/about/a%20history%20of%20odense|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the population of the city began to grow markedly; by 1900 it had 35,000 inhabitants.{{sfn|Renouf|2003|p=58}}

===Modern history===
Odense's most famous landmark was [[Odinstårnet]] (''The Odin Tower'') constructed in 1935, as the second-tallest tower in Europe, only surpassed by the [[Eiffel Tower]] with its 177 meters.  ''Odinstårnet'' was blown up by a Danish Nazi group in 1944 and has never been rebuilt.{{sfn|Lauridsen|2007|p=151}} However, a miniature model now stands in [[Odinsparken]] in the area where the original was located. During the German occupation in the [[Second World War]], Odense's general strike in August 1943 contributed to terminating collaboration with the Germans.<ref name=hoo/>

Until the beginning of the Danish industrial revolution, Odense was also the second-largest city in modern Denmark, but has in recent times been overtaken by Aarhus. From the 1960s Odense increasingly became a cultural hub, with the establishment of a university in 1966 and the launching of trade shows, including the large Odense Congress Centre.<ref name="dnet"/> In 1988 a major national television network, [[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV2]], was established in Odense.<ref name=hoo/>

In celebration of the thousandth anniversary in 1988, a forest, [[Tusindårsskoven]] (meaning "The Thousand Year Forest") was planted.<ref name="dnet"/> In 2005 the city celebrated the 200th anniversary of the birth of [[Hans Christian Andersen]].<ref name="dnet"/>

The [[Odense Steel Shipyard]] (''Staalskibsvæeft''), which since 1996 had been Denmark's largest shipbuilding facility, closed in 2012 as a result of international competition. Opened in 1919 by [[Mærsk|A.P. Møller]], it latterly produced container ships for Mærsk, the parent company. The Lindø site was sold to the Port of Odense (''Odense Havn'') who are developing the Lindø Industrial Park.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Bil,_b%C3%A5d,_fly_m.m./S%C3%B8fart/Rederier/Odense_Staalskibsv%C3%A6rft|title=Odense Staalskibsværft|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|access-date=30 June 2014 |language=da}}</ref>

[[File:Tornoe Odense Fjord.jpg|thumb|left|320px|[[Tornø]] in the Odense Fjord]]
The Odense River flows through Odense, to the south of the main shopping quarter.{{Sfn|Harding|2009|p=72}} To the north of the city is the Odense Fjord, and to the northeast, along the 165 road to [[Kerteminde]] is [[Kerteminde Fjord]]. The fjord is accessed through the narrow passage of Gabets, between Hals and [[Skoven]], and is connected by canal to the Port of Odense.{{sfn|Griffes|p=60}} The small fishing village of [[Bregnør Fiskerleje|Bregnør]] lies {{convert|2.3|mi}} to the southeast of the passage. A controlling depth of {{convert|11|m}} is reported in the northern part of channel between the entrance to the fjord and Lindo Terminal Quay.{{sfn|Griffes|p=60}} The bight of [[Fyns Hoved]] to the northeast of the harbour curves south to form the approach to Odense Fjord. The eastern side of the bight between Fyns Hoved and Skoven, {{convert|5.5|m}} to the south, is irregular, with a beach and hills behind it, and to the south of the bight is the small, shallow [[Korshavn Bay]], with the [[Korshavn Light]] in the vicinity. Skoven is a bare, rugged peninsula, with Dalby Bay (Dalby Bugt) to the east.{{sfn|Griffes|p=60}}

In the southwestern part of the Odense Fjord are the islands of [[Vigelsø]] and the 21 hectare [[Tornø]], although the latter is connected to the mainland by a 300-metre (980&nbsp;ft)-long causeway. Vigelsø is the largest island in the fjord at 132 hectares and is an important breeding ground for migratory birds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://naturstyrelsen.dk/naturoplevelser/naturguider/vigelsoe/|title=Vigelsø|publisher=Naturstyrelsen.dk|access-date=28 June 2014|language=da}}</ref> It is part of the [[Special Area of Conservation]] ''No. SPC 94, Odense Fjord'' under the [[European Union|EU]] [[Habitats Directive|Habitat]] and [[Birds Directive]]s and has been subject to close monitoring, with the target to reach at least "good" ecological status by 2015.{{Sfn|Andersen|Conley|2010|p=81}} The island is low-lying, the highest point of Østerhoved only reaching six metres above the sea. There is a 25 hectare forest on the northern part of the island while the southern part consists of [[meadow|coastal meadow]]s.

[[File:Sankt Albani kirke Odense.jpg|thumb|[[St. Alban's Church, Odense|St Alban's Church]], Odense]]

[[Nonnebakken]], a hill in the Odense area, is the site of one of Denmark's six former [[Viking ring castles]], built during the reign of [[Sweyn I of Denmark|Sweyn Forkbeard]], who had forced his father [[Harold I of Denmark|Harold Bluetooth]] to leave the country and seek refuge by the [[Jomsvikings]] in [[Wollin]] (modern Poland) in around 975. The fort provided its occupier the command of the Odense River passing next to the hill. The archaeological remains of the fort were heavily damaged when a building for the [[Odd Fellow]] [[Masonic Lodge|lodge]] was constructed on the site during the late nineteenth century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vikingeborge.dk/nonnebak.htm|title=Nonnebakken|publisher=Vikinge Borge|access-date=12 July 2014 |language=da}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://historiskatlas.dk/Nonnebakken_%28897%29|title=Nonnebakken|publisher=Historisk Atlas|access-date=12 July 2014 |language=da}}</ref>

===Odense University===
[[Odense University]], established by law in 1964, was the first of three new provincial universities created to relieve pressure on the universities of [[Copenhagen University|Copenhagen]] and [[Aarhus University|Aarhus]]. Teaching began in 1966. By the end of the 20th century, there were 11,000 students and some 5,000 employees. Before it became part of the [[University of Southern Denmark]] in 1998, it had four faculties covering arts, medicine, and natural and social sciences. The university building which opened in 1971 was designed by [[KHR Arkitekter]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Erhverv,_karriere_og_ledelse/P%C3%A6dagogik_og_uddannelse/Danske_universiteter/Odense_Universitet|title=Odense Universitet|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|access-date=5 June 2014 |language=da}}</ref>

===University of Southern Denmark===
[[File:The Faculty of Engineering, University of Southern Denmark.jpg|left|thumb|The Faculty of Engineering at the University of Southern Denmark's Odense Campus]]
The University of Southern Denmark (''Syddansk Universitet'') was established in 1998 as a merger of Odense University, the Southern Denmark Business School (''Handelshøjskole Syd''), the Southern Engineering School (''Ingeniørhøjskole Syd'') and the South Jutland University Centre (''Sydjysk Universitetscenter''). The main campus is in Odense but there are also departments in Copenhagen, Esbjerg, Kolding, Slagelse and Sønderborg. With some 26,000 students (2012), the establishment is Denmark's third largest university.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Erhverv,_karriere_og_ledelse/P%C3%A6dagogik_og_uddannelse/Danske_universiteter/Syddansk_Universitet?highlight=syddansk%20universitet|title=Syddansk Universitet|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|access-date=12 July 2014 |language=da}}</ref> The Faculty of Engineering (''Det Tekniske Fakultet'') combines several institutions: ''Odense Maskinteknikum'' (a mechanical engineering college which was established in 1905 and in 1962 became the Southern Engineering School), the Mads Clausen Institute and the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Institute.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Erhverv%2c_karriere_og_ledelse/P%C3%A6dagogik_og_uddannelse/Danske_universiteter/Syddansk_Universitet/Det_Tekniske_Fakultet|title=Det Tekniske Fakultet|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|access-date=5 July 2014 |language=da}}</ref>

The Odense campus of the University of Southern Denmark is known to host all faculties and study programs at the same place, contrary to, for instance, [[University of Copenhagen]] where the institutes and disciplines have been spread out in the city. This, too, is reflected in the strategy of the university which stresses cross-disciplinary research. In 2024, [[University of Southern Denmark|The University of Southern Denmark]] campus and Nyt OUH – the new buildings for [[Odense University Hospital]] – will be physically connected to promote cooperations between the two institutions.

=== Cycling Initiatives in Odense ===
In 2016, the city of Odense, Denmark implemented a new form of technology to allow for more efficient bike travel. Often, when it is raining heavily, cyclists have had to sit in the rain for long periods of time at traffic lights, and this disincentives them to cycle to work that day. To fix this problem, Odense has placed [[rain sensor]]s in traffic lights along their super bike highways. These sensors interact with [[motion detector]]s which "allow the system to register when bikes are within 70 meters of the intersection."<ref>{{Cite web |website=www.cycling-embassy.dk |access-date=2023-09-14 |title=Rain makes the light go green for cyclists in the Danish city of Odense |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114075358/http://www.cycling-embassy.dk/2016/05/10/rain-means-green-light-cyclists-danish-city-odense/ |archive-date=14 Jan 2017 |url=http://www.cycling-embassy.dk/2016/05/10/rain-means-green-light-cyclists-danish-city-odense/}}</ref> They then automatically prolong the green light. The intersection includes a small sign that explains the system to the cyclists, and when a light goes on, they can see the system is functioning. This technology allows cyclists to experience up to 20 seconds longer of green light, and makes their overall journey more efficient, safer, and dryer.

The [[Cycling Embassy of Denmark]] is the organization spearheading this research and initiatives. While there is not much criticism due to the cycling culture that is already fairly prevalent in Odense, those who commute in cars would be naturally upset by the longer red lights. However, the embassy believes that there should not be too much pushback because of the [[Social equity|equity]] issue involved with being exposed to the rain versus being sheltered in a car.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stateofgreen.com/en/news/10-examples-of-green-mobility-in-cities/|title=10 Examples of Green Mobility in Cities}}</ref> It will also only be utilized up to 3 times a month.

This initiative does not only optimize the corridor flow and speed for cyclists, but reinforces the "[[green wave]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ramboll.com/ingenuity/how-its-and-technology-can-accelerate-making-cycling-about-people|title=How technology can accelerate making cycling about people|access-date=5 November 2019|archive-date=5 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105153917/https://ramboll.com/ingenuity/how-its-and-technology-can-accelerate-making-cycling-about-people|url-status=dead}}</ref> The green wave is known as the ability to cycle through several intersections without having to stop. This is the overall thought the Cycling Embassy had in installing rain sensors, as they hope to implement the technology in other intersections of the city, creating an efficient city-wide system of sustainable transit. Eventually, riding a bike will be easier than riding a car.
