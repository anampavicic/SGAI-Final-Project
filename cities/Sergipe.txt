'''Sergipe''' ({{IPA|pt-BR|sɛʁˈʒipi|lang|Pt-br Sergipe.ogg}}), officially '''State of Sergipe''', is a [[States of Brazil|state]] of [[Brazil]]. Located in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Region]] along the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of the country, Sergipe is the smallest state in Brazil by geographical area at {{convert|21,910|km2|mi2}}, larger only than the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]]. Sergipe borders [[Bahia]] to the south and west and [[Alagoas]] to the north. [[Aracaju]] is the capital and the largest city in the state; the state is divided into 75 [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipalities]]. The state has 1.1% of the Brazilian population and produces only 0.6% of the Brazilian [[GDP]].<ref name="ig"/>

==Geography==
As with most of the states in northeastern Brazil, inland Sergipe is almost entirely [[savanna]] (''[[caatinga]]''), and its coastline is characterized by [[mangrove]]s, [[swamp]]s and sandy [[beach]]es. A small strip of [[tropical rainforest]] runs down the coast.
[[Image:Teleférico de Aracaju.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aerial tramway]] in Aracaju.]]

The [[São Francisco River]] forms its northern boundary, and the drainage of the northern part of the state is northward and eastward to that river. The southern half of the state slopes eastward and is drained directly into the Atlantic through a number of small rivers, the largest of which are the Irapiranga (whose source in the state of Bahia is called Vaza Barris), the [[Real River (Brazil)|Real]] and the [[Cotinguiba River|Cotinguiba]]. These streams are navigable for short distances, but are obstructed by [[mouth bar|sandbars at their mouths]]; because of these, there are no good ports on the coast. The surface of the state resembles, in part, that of Bahia, with a zone of forested lands near the coast and beyond this forested zone lies a higher zone of rough open country, called ''[[agreste]]''. There is a sandy belt along the coast, and the western frontier is slightly mountainous. The land in between is very fertile, especially in the forested region where rainfall is abundant. Further inland, the year is divided into wet and dry seasons with occasional prolonged droughts. These are [[pastoral]] areas, and the lower fertile lands are cultivated.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Sergipe |volume=24 |pages=666–667 |inline=1}}</ref>

[[Image:Skyline Aracaju1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Skyline]] of [[Aracaju]].]]

The capital of the state is [[Aracaju]] (pop. 479 767 in 2003), on the lower course or [[estuary]] of the Cotinguiba River, near the coast. The sandbar at the entrance to this river is exceptionally dangerous, and the port is frequented only by coasting vessels of light [[draft (hull)|draught]]. The city is found on a sandy plain, and there are sand dunes within the city limits. In 1911, the main public buildings included a large plain church with unfinished twin towers, the government palace, the legislative halls, a public school and public hospital.<ref name=EB1911/>

The other principal towns are [[Estância, Sergipe|Estância]] - pop. 62,218 (in 2005) on the Rio Real river in the southern part of the state and a center for the manufacturing of cotton-based textiles, cigars, cigarettes and [[soap]] as well as an active trade center; [[Laranjeiras, Sergipe|Laranjeiras]] - pop. 26,452 (in 2005), located in a highly productive sugar-growing district north of the capital; [[Capela, Sergipe|Capela]] - pop. 27,403 (in 2005); [[Simão Dias]] - pop. 39,706 (in 2005); [[Lagarto, Sergipe|Lagarto]] - pop. 90,345 (in 2005); [[São Cristóvão]], formerly Sergipe d'el-Rey - pop. 75,353 (in 2005), which was also the old colonial capital near the mouth of the Irapiranga.

==History==
[[Image:Documento real da emancipação da capitania de Sergipe 1820.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Royal decree of King John VI, granting the administrative emancipation of the Captaincy of Sergipe on July 8, 1820.]]
[[Image:Ponte Aracaju-Barra.jpg|thumb|right|Aracaju-Barra Bridge at night.]]

Present-day Sergipe was home to numerous indigenous peoples, including the Kanindé (Canindé), [[Aratus]], and [[Tupi people]]s. [[Gaspar de Lemos]] briefly landed in the region in 1501, and the Portuguese Crown declared the region part of the [[Captaincy of Bahia]]. The area of Sergipe was one of the last coastal regions of Brazil whose indigenous population (consisting of [[Tupinambá people|Tupinambá tribes]]) resisted subjugation to Portuguese colonial rule. The area was fully brought under Portuguese rule after approximately two decades of warfare during which thousands of natives were murdered and thousands more enslaved to work on sugar plantations. [[São Cristóvão]] was the site of the first [[Portugal|Portuguese]] settlement, in 1591, at Sergipe D'El-Rey.<ref>Hemming, John. ''Red Gold — The conquest of the Brazilian Indians'' 2nd Edition. 1995. Pgs. 175-177. ISBN 0-330-42732-6</ref>

As with other states in the northeast, Sergipe was invaded numerous times by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], and frequently raided by French [[buccaneer]]s. During the 17th century, the state was known throughout the Americas for its [[Dalbergia cearensis|king-wood]], a prized commodity that was the primary attraction during the buccaneer raids, and probably a factor in Dutch military expeditions. From 1641 to 1645, the territory belonged to Dutch-controlled Brazil ([[New Holland (Brazil)|New Holland]]). The Dutch built a fort, the first in the region, between the rivers São Francisco and Sergipe.

The Portuguese regained control in 1645. By the 18th century, the Portuguese military had driven off the pirates permanently. Sergipe remained a part of the state of Bahia, and was responsible for a third of Bahia's sugar production by 1723. Sugarcane culture was established in the valleys of the São Francisco, Japaratuba, Sergipe, Vaza-Barris, Piauí and Real rivers. Areas unsuitable for sugarcane plantations on the coast and in the hinterland were developed for livestock; Sergipe subsequently became a supplier of draft animals for the farms of Bahia and Pernambuco. The region was also a significant producer of leather. [[John VI of Portugal]] signed a decree to separated Sergipe from Bahia on July 8, 1820, and Brigadier Carlos César Burlamárqui was named the state's first governor.<ref name="ig"/>

Sergipe retained its separation from Bahia after the [[Independence of Brazil]] in 1822, first briefly as the Captaincy of Sergipe, then as the Province of Sergipe. Economic development was low during the [[Empire of Brazil]] in the 19th century, other than a brief cotton boom in the second half of the century. The provincial president Inácio Joaquim Barbosa moved the capital from inland São Cristóvão to coastal [[Aracaju]] on the coast on March 17, 1855. Sergipe became a state under the proclamation of the Republic of Brazil in 1892.

===20th century===

The state saw bitter political disputes in the early 20th century, notably between [[Fausto Cardoso]] (1864-1906) and Olímpio Campos. Sergipe became notorious for its outlaws in the 1930s, including Virgolino Ferreira da Silva, better known as [[Lampião]], the "King of Bandits", who terrorized the state for almost a decade until his beheading by the Brazilian police in 1938. His head was later displayed on a pole in a village square.

Coastal Sergipe was attacked by [[Nazi Germany]] at the beginning of [[World War II]] in response to the rupture of relations between Brazil and the [[Axis powers]]. The [[German submarine U-507]], commanded by [[Harro Schacht]], attacked the [[Brazilian cargo ship Baependi|Baependi]], [[Brazilian cargo ship Araraquara|Araraquara]], and {{Ill|Brazilian cargo ship Aníbal Benévolo|lt=Aníbal Benévolo|pt|Aníbal Benévolo (navio)}} off Sergipe between August 15 and 16, 1942. The shipwrecks caused approximately 600 civilian deaths, and German and Italian immigrants communities in Sergipe were persecuted after the attack by mobs. The attacks of the U-507 prompted President Getúlio Vargas to declare war on Germany and Italy on August 22 of the same year.<ref name="g"/>

[[Image:Aeroporto de Aracaju.jpg|thumb|right|International Airport of Aracaju.]]

===Airport===
[[Santa Maria Airport (Sergipe)|Aracaju–Santa Maria International Airport]] was inaugurated on October 30, 1952 with a runway only 1200 meters in length; the airport did not have an access road until 1958, so after construction of one operating efficiency increased. In 1961 the runway was extended to 1500 meters and a passenger terminal was built in 1962. In February 1975 control of the airport was handed over to [[Infraero]]. The airport's runways reached their current configuration of 2,200 meters in length in 1993. The passenger terminal also underwent several changes and, in 1998, Aracaju gained a new building, measuring 10 thousand square meters. Santa Maria Airport began to be managed by Aena Brasil in 2020, after the company won the concessions auction of the National Civil Aviation Agency (Anac), held in 2019.<ref>[https://www.aenabrasil.com.br/pt/aeroportos/aeroporto-internacional-santa-maria-aracaju/Historico-.html Aeroporto Internacional Santa Maria – Aracaju (SBAR)]</ref>

The main highways in Sergipe are [[BR-101]], [[BR-235]] and [[BR-349]]. BR-101, which belongs to the Brazilian Federal Government, has been receiving duplication works since 1997, and 27 years later, in 2024, they have not yet been completed in Sergipe. With 206 kilometers long, BR-101 is considered the main highway for those traveling through the state. It connects states in the Northeast and is one of the most used to reach the capital Aracaju. BR-101 moves the state's wealth, as it is the way to transport the sugar cane that is produced in the region, and to transport iron ore that comes from Bahia to the Port of Sergipe.<ref>[https://der.se.gov.br/mapa-rodoviario/ Sergipe road map]</ref><ref>[https://www.gov.br/dnit/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/principal-rodovia-de-sergipe-br-101-recebe-investimentos-do-dnit Principal rodovia de Sergipe, BR-101, recebe investimentos do DNIT]</ref><ref>[https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u23581.shtml FHC elogia desempenho de Padilha e tenta aproximar PMDB]</ref><ref>[https://g1.globo.com/se/sergipe/noticia/2023/09/30/ministro-dos-transporte-diz-que-parte-da-duplicacao-da-br-101-em-se-sera-entregue-ate-dezembro.ghtml Ministro dos Transportes diz que parte da duplicação da BR-101 em SE será entregue até dezembro]</ref>

==Tourism and recreation==

===São Cristóvão===
{{Main|São Cristóvão}}
[[São Cristóvão]] is the fourth oldest town in the country, and was Sergipe's state capital until 1855. It is located some {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the current capital Aracaju.

As a planned urban settlement, the town contains churches and religious ensembles dating back to the colonial period. Most of these monuments are concentrated around the São Francisco Square.

In 1939, São Cristóvão was designated as a National Treasure by the Instituto do Patrimônio Histórico e Artístico Nacional — IPHAN (the Brazilian National Historical and Artistical Heritage Institute). More recently, in 2010, São Francisco Square in the Town of São Cristóvão became a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].

===Xingó Canyon===
[[Image:Rio São Francisco.jpg|thumb|right|Xingó [[Canyon]].]]
[[Image:Bacia sao francisco.jpg|thumb|right|São Francisco [[river]].]]
Includes fascinating landscape, rock formations, crystal-clear waters, ecological trails, Caatinga Theme Park, exuberant vegetation and diversified fauna and flora. The Xingó Canyon is located in Canindé do São Francisco, on the banks of the lengthy and well-known São Francisco river. It is the world's fifth most navigable river. The river is formed in a valley reaching up to 170 m deep, being 65&nbsp;km long and at certain locations between 50 and 300 m wide. The water volume of the canyon is about 3.8 billion m<sup>3</sup>.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.turismo.gov.br/turismo/noticias/todas_noticias/20110121-3.html|title=O que o interior de Sergipe tem?|publisher=Ministerio do Turismo.gov.br|access-date=1 April 2011}}</ref>

To navigate between the rocks of this gigantic cliff, embedded in the middle of Sergipe's Alto Sertão, is an unforgettable experience.  There are imposing valleys forming a 50 m-high canyon, surrounding a lake that, in certain points, reaches a depth of 190 m.  Nests of herons and river islands complete the spectacle.  The rocks guard traces of the area's first inhabitants who lived there more than 8,000 years ago.

There is also evidence of Lampião's stay there, with his gang of outlaws in more modern times. The Angico trail, in Poço Redondo, leads to a cavern by the same name, where Lampião, Maria Bonita and nine other outlaws lost their lives. Located in the town of Canindé do São Francisco, {{convert|213|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Aracaju, Xingó Canyon is one of the most famous rock formations in the area, embellishing the landscape of the dry Northeastern backwoods. It is hot all year round, but strong winds blowing from December to January keep temperatures at a very comfortable level. Between May and August, it rains frequently.

===Sergipe Beaches===
Sergipe has an extensive coastline where it is very attractive for tourists from Brazil and the world. The clear and greenish waters, with white sand attract attention. The capital [[Aracaju]] also stands out for Praia de Atalaia which is considered the beach with the best beach sidewalk in Brazil. Outside the capital, the coast of Sergipe is highly valued for its distinctive aspect: Praia do Saco (municipality of [[Estância]]), a beach located in the south of the state was considered one of the 100 best beaches in the world by the French magazine [[Les Voyageurs]]. In it the tourist is faced with [[sand dunes]] and an extensive coastal strip that has the peculiarity of Sergipe; Praia da Costa ([[Barra dos Coqueiros]]), the Delta of the [[São Francisco River]] ([[Brejo Grande]]), Praia de Pirambu ([[Pirambu]]), are other beaches that enhance the state's tourism.

The river beaches, such as the Croa do Goré sandbar and Ilha dos Namorados, which are tourist attractions reached by Catamaran on the [[Vaza Barris River]] in Aracaju, can also be highlighted.

==Flag==
{{See also|List of Sergipe state symbols}}
The stars on the flag of Sergipe represent the number of [[river]] [[estuary|estuaries]] in the state, and the green and yellow stripes represent Sergipe's union with the rest of Brazil. It was designed by José Rodrigues Bastos Coelho, a businessman who felt that Brazilian [[ship]]s should carry flags to identify their state of origin. It was officially adopted on October 19, 1920.

In 1937, dictator [[Getúlio Vargas]] abolished all state flags and symbols, but they were allowed again in 1946. In 1951, when the Sergipe legislature began to consider restoring the state flag, it decided to change the number of stars, so that there would be one for every [[municipality]] in the state. In 1952, this new design was scrapped and replaced by the original 5-star design.
