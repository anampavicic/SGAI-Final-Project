'''Surat Thani''' ({{langx|th|สุราษฎร์ธานี}}, {{IPA|th|sù.râːt tʰāː.nīː|pron}}) is a city in [[Amphoe Mueang Surat Thani]], [[Surat Thani Province]], southern [[Thailand]]. It lies {{convert|651|km|abbr=on}} south of Bangkok. It is the capital of [[Surat Thani Province]]. The city has a population of 132,040 (2019), and an area of {{convert|68.97|km2|abbr=on}}. The city's population density is 1,914 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>. 

Surat Thani is located near the mouth of the [[Tapi River, Thailand|Tapi River]] on the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. The city offers no major tourist attractions in itself, and is mainly known to tourists as the jumping-off point to [[Ko Samui]], [[Ko Tao]], and [[Ko Pha Ngan]]. It is the regional commercial center, with a seaport dealing in the main products of the province, rubber and coconuts.

==Toponymy==
The city received its name, which means "city of good people", by King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI) in 1915. The name was given to the city due to the intense devotion of the locals to [[Buddhism]]. Previously the city was known as '''Bandon''' ({{langx|th|บ้านดอน}}), meaning "village on higher ground". The name of the city is taken from the [[India]]n city [[Surat]] in [[Gujarat]] on the Indian River Tapi. King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI) gave this name to his city as he was impressed with the Indian city.

==History==
On 21 December 1930 Surat Thani became a sanitary district (''[[sukhaphiban]]''),<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=47|issue=ก|pages=271–273|script-title=th:พระบรมราชโองการ ประกาศ ใช้พระราชบัญญัติจัดการสุขาภิบาล จังหวัดสุราษฎร์ธานี มณฑลนครศรีธรรมราช|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2473/A/271.PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601010826/http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2473/A/271.PDF|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 1, 2012|date=December 21, 1930|language=th}}</ref> which was upgraded to a town (''[[thesaban mueang]]'') on 7 December 1935, with a municipal area of {{convert|2.67|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=51|issue=ก|pages=1758–1762|script-title=th:พระราชกฤษฎีกาจัดตั้งเทศบาลเมืองสุราษฎร์ธานี จังหวัดสุราษฎร์ธานี พุทธศักราช ๒๔๗๘|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2478/A/1758.PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409014617/http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2478/A/1758.PDF|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 9, 2008|date=December 10, 1935|language=th}}</ref> The area of the municipality was enlarged to {{convert|6.95|km2|abbr=on}} on 14 October 1958,<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=75|issue=79 ก|pages=555–558|script-title=th:พระราชกฤษฎีกาเปลี่ยนแปลงเขตเทศบาลเมืองสุราษฎร์ธานี จังหวัดสุราษฎร์ธานี พ.ศ. ๒๕๐๑|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2501/A/079/555.PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409014539/http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2501/A/079/555.PDF|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 9, 2008|date=October 14, 1958|language=th}}</ref> and on 22 December 1994 it was further enlarged to {{convert|68.97|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=111|issue=59 ก|pages=29–32|script-title=th:พระราชกฤษฎีกาเปลี่ยนแปลงเขตเทศบาลเมืองสุราษฎร์ธานี จังหวัดสุราษฎร์ธานี (ฉบับที่ ๒) พ.ศ. ๒๕๓๗|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2537/A/059/29.PDF
