'''Kelantan''' ({{IPA-may|kəˈlantan}}; Jawi: {{lang|ms|{{Script|Arab|کلنتن}}}}; [[Kelantan-Pattani Malay|Kelantanese Malay]]: ''Klate''; {{IPA|Mfa|kläˈtɛ}}){{efn|name=fn|Also spelled as "Kelate" by the some state of Malaysia}} is a state in [[Malaysia]]. The capital, [[Kota Bharu]], includes the royal seat of Kubang Kerian. The [[honorific|honorific name]] of the state is ''Darul Naim'' (Jawi: {{lang|ms|{{Script|Arab|دار النعيم}}}}; "The Blissful Abode"). Kelantan is the only state outside of East Malaysia that does not use the term district in its second-level administrative division. Instead, the divisions are called colonies ({{lang|ms|Jajahan}}) or collectivities with one autonomous subdistrict.

Kelantan is located in the north-eastern corner of the [[Peninsular Malaysia]]. Kelantan is an [[Agriculture|agrarian]] state with [[paddy field]]s, fishing villages and [[casuarina]]-lined beaches. Kelantan is home to some of the most ancient archaeological discoveries in Malaysia, including several prehistoric aboriginal settlements.

Due to Kelantan's relative isolation and largely rural lifestyle, Kelantanese culture differs somewhat from Malay culture in the rest of the peninsula; this is reflected in the cuisine, arts and the unique Kelantanese Malay language, which is unintelligible even for some speakers of standard Malay.

Kelantan is bordered by [[Narathiwat province]] of [[Thailand]] to the north, [[Terengganu]] to the south-east, [[Perak]] to the west and [[Pahang]] to the south. To the north-east of Kelantan is the [[South China Sea]]. Kelantan has diverse tropical rainforests and an equatorial climate. The state's mountain ranges belong to the [[Titiwangsa Mountains]], which are part of the [[Tenasserim Hills]] that span southern [[Myanmar]], southern Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia, with Mount Yong Belar being the state's highest point.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Mao Kun map - Songkla, Langkasuka, Kelantan, Trengganu.png|thumb|The 17th century [[Mao Kun map]] from ''[[Wubei Zhi]]'' which is based on the early 15th century navigation maps of [[Zheng He]] showing Kelantan river estuary (吉蘭丹港).]]
There are a number of theories for the origin of the name '''Kelantan'''. One theory proposes that the word Kelantan comes from a modified version of the word ''gelam hutam'', the [[Malay language|Malay]] word for the [[cajuput]], or swamp tea tree (''[[Melaleuca]] leucadendron''). Other theories claim that the name comes from the Malay word ''kilatan'', "shiny or glittery" or ''kolam tanah'', "clay pool".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.penerangan.gov.my/dmdocuments/malaysia_2017/files/basic-html/page84.html |title=Page 84 - Malaysia 2017 |access-date=14 August 2018 |archive-date=14 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180814232602/http://www.penerangan.gov.my/dmdocuments/malaysia_2017/files/basic-html/page84.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Kelantan was called '''Kalantan''' ({{langx|th|กลันตัน}}) by the Siamese when it was under their influence.

=== Kelantan Sultanate ===

In 1499, Kelantan became a [[vassal state]] of the [[Malacca Sultanate]]. With the [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|fall of Malacca]] in 1511, Kelantan was divided up and ruled by petty chieftains, paying tribute to [[Patani Kingdom|Patani]], then a powerful Malay Kingdom of the eastern peninsula. By the early 17th century, most of these Kelantanese chiefs became subject to [[Pattani Kingdom|Patani]]. The legendary Cik [[Siti Wan Kembang]] was said to have reigned over Kelantan between 1610 and 1667.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Aljunied |first1=Khairudin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2varDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA90 |title=Islam in Malaysia: An Entwined History |date=30 August 2019 |isbn=9780190925215 |page=90|publisher=Oxford University Press }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Manderson |first=Lenore |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4WPaAAAAMAAJ&q=Siti+Wan+Kembang+1667 |title=Wanita, politik dan perubahan: pergerakan Kaum Ibu UMNO, Malaysia, 1945-1972 |date=1981 |publisher=Fajar Bakti |page=39 |language=ms}}</ref> Kelantan made a political alliance with Patani during the reign of [[Raja Biru]] in 1619 for mutual trade and military interests.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bradley |first1=Francis R. |title=Moral Order in a Time of Damnation: The "Hikayat Patani" in Historical Context |journal=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies |date=Jun 2009 |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=274–5 |doi=10.1017/S0022463409000150 |jstor=27751564 |s2cid=154361662 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/27751564 |issn=0022-4634}}</ref> The Queen of Patani was deposed in 1651 by the Raja of Kelantan, starting a period of Kelantanese rule in Patani.<ref name=andaya>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XSOHDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA76 |title=A History of Malaysia |author1=Barbara Watson Andaya |author2=Leonard Y Andaya |date=11 November 2016 |page=76 |isbn=978-1137605153 |publisher=Red Globe Press }}{{Dead link|date=April 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> 

[[File:Flag of Kelantan (1912 - 1923).svg|thumb|left|The flag of Kelantan before 1924.]]
Around 1760, Long Yunus, an aristocratic warlord of [[Pattani Kingdom|Patani]] origin succeeded in unifying the territory of present-day Kelantan and was enthroned by his father-in-law Ku Tanang Wangsa ([[Regent]] of Terengganu) as ''Yang di-Pertuan Muda'' or Deputy Ruler of Kelantan. Long Yunus was succeeded in 1795 by his son-in-law Tengku Muhammad by Sultan Mansur of Terengganu. The [[enthronement]] of Tengku Muhammad by Terengganu was opposed by Long Yunus' sons, triggering a war against Terengganu by Long Muhammad, the eldest son of Long Yunus. The pro-Terengganu faction was defeated in 1800 and Long Muhammad ruled Kelantan with the new title of ''Sultan'' as Sultan Muhammad I.

Later, when the Sultan died childless, it triggered another civil war among claimants to the throne. His nephew Long Senik Mulut Merah, triumphed over his uncles and cousins and assumed the throne in 1835 as Sultan Muhammad II.

[[File:Burung Petala Indera III.jpg|thumb|Thousands flocked into the streets of Kota Bharu to witness the [[Burung Petala Procession]] in 1933.]]
Sultan Muhammad II used his loose alliance with [[Siam]] to form the modern Kelantan state, centered in his new fort on the eastern bank of the [[Kelantan River|Kelantan river]], which became Kota Bharu in 1844.

=== Unfederated Malay States ===

Under the terms of the [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909]], the Thais relinquished their claims over Kelantan, Terengganu, [[Kedah]] and [[Perlis]] to the [[British Empire]], and Kelantan thus became one of the [[Unfederated Malay States]] with a [[British Resident|British Adviser]].

=== Japanese occupation ===

Kelantan was where the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] first landed during their [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|invasion of Malaya]], on 8 December 1941. In 1943, Kelantan was transferred by the Japanese to Thailand and became a [[Si Rat Malai|province of Thailand]]. Kelantan reverted to Malaya upon the end of [[World War II]] in August 1945.

=== Malayan Union and the Federation of Malaya ===

Kelantan became part of the [[Malayan Union]] in 1946 and then the [[Federation of Malaya]] on 1 February 1948, and together with other Malayan states attained independence on 31 August 1957. On 16 September 1963, Kelantan became one of the [[states of Malaysia]].

=== Modern history ===
The [[Malaysian Islamic Party]] (PAS) came to power in Kelantan for the first time in 1959. In November 1977, the federal government declared a [[1977 Kelantan Emergency|state of emergency in Kelantan]] following a political crisis and street violence. An election took place soon after the emergency, in which the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) won removing the PAS from power. Kelantan was then governed by the [[Barisan Nasional]] coalition (of which UMNO was part of) until the 1990 General Election when the PAS returned with an overwhelming victory, winning all 39 State and 13 Parliamentary seats. The success was achieved through the PAS-led coalition, called [[Angkatan Perpaduan Ummah]] (APU). In the following General Election in 1995, PAS won again, though with a reduced majority. The PAS won a large victory in 1999 due in part to Malayan anger over the treatment of former Deputy Prime Minister [[Anwar Ibrahim]] by Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]] and other officials of the national government. In 2004 the PAS nearly lost control of Kelantan, retaining it with only a 1-seat majority, when the Barisan Nasional, under the new leadership of [[Abdullah Badawi]] following Mahathir's retirement, won by a landslide nationally. However, after the [[2008 Malaysian general election]], the PAS regained a two-thirds majority of seats in the state assembly.

== Geography ==
Rising high on the slopes of [[Gunung Korbu]], the second highest peak in Peninsular Malaysia, the Nengiri River flows east to merge first with the Galas, and then with the Lebir — the latter begins in the [[Taman Negara]] National Park — before turning decisively northwards and emptying into the shallow waters of the South China Sea. From Kuala Krai the conjoined streams become the [[Kelantan River]] (also known as Sungai Kelantan), a broad, mud-coloured stream which dominates the fertile [[coastal plain]]s and defines the geography of the region. The Kelantan River valley is a fertile rice-bowl, rich in hardwoods and [[rubber]] and lush with tropical fruits.

For centuries, Kelantan was mostly separated from the rest of the country by the [[Titiwangsa Mountains]], which runs from north to south through the peninsula. Weeks of hard travel were required to reach Kelantan. The easiest way to Kelantan was to sail around the peninsula. For this reason Kelantan's history often involves the sea, and boats. Even today, many of its people are tied to the sea. A discussion with many coastal residents will confirm that their ancestors, as far back as they know, were "of the sea."{{Ciation needed|date=June 2024}}

[[KTM Intercity|A railway line]] was built in the 1920s, during [[British Malaya|British colonial rule]], linking [[Tumpat District|Tumpat]] on the state's northern coast, through the jungles of upper Kelantan and Pahang and then on to other states. Also, between the 1920s and 1980s, [[trunk road]]s were built to link Kelantan with adjacent states. Presently, one can travel by road from the capital city Kuala Lumpur to Kota Bharu using [[Malaysia Federal Route 8|national highway 8]] through the mountain range within 8 hours.

=== Climate ===
Kelantan has a [[tropical climate]], with temperatures from 21 to 32&nbsp;°C and intermittent rain throughout the year. The wet season is the east-coast [[monsoon season]] from November to January.

== Economy ==
Kelantan has a chiefly [[agrarian economy]] dominated by [[rice]], [[rubber]] and [[tobacco]]. [[Fishing]] along its 96-kilometre coastline is also an important economic activity. [[Cottage industries]] which employ traditional skills in handicraft production such as [[batik]], woodcarving and [[songket]] weaving are also evident. Logging activities are active given the vast remaining area of forest. In recent years, tourism, especially to offshore islands, has increased in importance. A few reputable hotels have been established and more modern shopping malls have been opened to cater to urban populations.

Kota Bharu, the capital, is the major urban centre, and there are also plans to open up the southern portion of the state under an ambitious multimillion-dollar development project. The main market at the city centre is a top attraction.{{Citation needed|date=June 2024}}

Kelantan had a GDP per capita in 2006 at RM7,985.<ref>http://umkeprints.umk.edu.my/209/1/Paper%202.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180814232719/http://umkeprints.umk.edu.my/209/1/Paper%202.pdf |date=14 August 2018 }} {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref> The State Socioeconomic Report 2017 published on 26 July 2018 reported that Kelantan has a GDP per capita of RM13,593 in 2017, significantly lower than any other state in Malaysia.<ref>https://www.dosm.gov.my/v1/index.php?r=column/pdfPrev&id=d21BMHFxZFBIcFlCNExIYUQ1cE92Zz09 {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref>

Kelantan's cultural ties with Pattani make use of the Malaysian-Thai border, where Kelantanese and Southern Thais cross frequently to visit their relatives and transport goods for small business.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

== Politics ==
[[File:Flag of Kelantan.svg|150px|thumb|left|The flag consists of a white emblem on a red background. The red background signifies the loyalty of the people of Kelantan. The white emblem stands for the sanctity of the office of the Ruler.]]A part of the conservative Malay heartland, Kelantan has been ruled by the [[Malaysian Islamic Party]] (PAS) since 1990. It is one of four Malaysian states led by PAS after the 2022 elections, the others being Terengganu, Kedah, and Perlis.

Almost all PAS members are Malay Muslims, as are about 95% of Kelantan's population.

For years, the PAS has attempted to impose a strict interpretation of [[Islamic Law]] on Kelantan. It has successfully imposed certain social strictures such as single-sex supermarket queues, separate public benches for men and women, and limiting entertainment centers to prohibit "salacious behavior."{{Citation needed|date=June 2024}} Proposals to institute punishments such as amputation of limbs for thievery and execution for blasphemy (collectively known as [[Hudud]] Law), however, have been blocked by the national government on constitutional grounds.

One of the most controversial steps that PAS have taken in Kelantan is to place strict restrictions or outright bans on the traditional performance of syncretic Malay theatrical forms, such as [[Wayang]] Kulit, [[Mak Yong]], [[Dikir barat|Dikir Barat]], and Main Puteri. PAS also took action to remove any sculpture that looked like human or animal, modified versions without the traditional references to Hindu [[Deva (Hinduism)|dewa]]–[[Devi|dewi]] and traditional Malay ''hantu'' (spirits or ghosts) and otherwise in keeping with orthodox Islam are, however, tolerated in some instances. Also restricted are public performances by women: Aside from [[Qur'an|Quran]] recitals, such arrangements are entirely banned if men are in the audience. While PAS has maintained that these steps were to promote Islam and put an end to immoral behavior among the Muslim population, many consider them an act of defiance against Barisan Nasional's laws — which are more tolerant, depending on one's viewpoint — and also a significant loss to Malay traditional arts.

== Oil royalties ==

=== Assignment deed ===
On 9 May 1975, an agreement was signed between the [[Menteri Besar of Kelantan]], Datuk [[Mohamed Nasir]], and the Chairman of [[Petronas]], [[Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah]]. According to the terms of the agreement, Kelantan was to receive a cash payment of 5 percent a year biannually, for any oil found in Kelantan or its coastal areas. In return, Kelantan grants Petronas to exclusive rights to "petroleum whether lying onshore or offshore of Malaysia".

It became an issue as to whether Kelantan had the right to claim oil royalties from federal government as described in the agreement. Relevant to the issue, in Schedule 9, List I of the Federal Constitution, the following topics are assigned to the Federal Government:

:*Except as to State rights over permits and licences, the Federal Government has rights over development of mineral resources, mines, mining, minerals and mineral ores, oils and oilfields, petroleum products, safety in mines and oilfields
:*Gas and gasworks, production and distribution of power and energy
:*Foreign and extraterritorial jurisdiction
:*Treaties, agreements and conventions with other countries and all matters which bring the Federation into relations with any other country

As for the state government:
:*Land: Schedule 9 List II, Para 2(a). Under the Interpretation Acts, 1948 and 1967, Section 3, land includes "the surface of the earth ... all substances therein... all vegetations and other natural products... whether on or below the surface... and land covered by water". The territorial waters of Kelantan will come within the definition of "land covered by water". Territorial waters are defined by Section 4(2) of the Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance No 7, 1969. Subject to some exceptions, they refer to three nautical miles.
:*Revenue from lands: Schedule 10, Part III Para 2.
:*In addition to the income from land, one notes that in Article 110[3A] there is provision for discretionary payment on such terms and conditions as maybe prescribed by or under federal law of the export duty on "mineral oils" produced in the state. Petroleum comes within the meaning of "mineral oils" under Section 10 of the Petroleum Development Act.

From the schedule, Peninsular Malaysian states have the constitutional right to set fees for permits and licences for extraction of any petroleum that is derived from their land and territorial waters. Anything beyond territorial waters, such as on the [[continental shelf]], is entirely in federal hands. However, because exploration of oil and gas is approximately 150&nbsp;km from Kota Bharu and beyond the territorial water of Kelantan. Emeritus Professor [[Shad Saleem Faruqi]] concluded that Kelantan has no constitutional right to regulate it and to receive compensation for it.<ref name="thestar">[http://thestar.com.my/columnists/story.asp?col=reflectingonthelaw&file=/2010/2/24/columnists/reflectingonthelaw/5729109&sec=Reflecting%20On%20The%20Law Columnists – Opinion | The Star Online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011174902/http://thestar.com.my/columnists/story.asp?col=reflectingonthelaw&file=%2F2010%2F2%2F24%2Fcolumnists%2Freflectingonthelaw%2F5729109&sec=Reflecting%20On%20The%20Law |date=11 October 2012 }}. Thestar.com.my. Retrieved on 27 September 2013.</ref> He further argued given the agreement deed to support Kelantan rights over royalties will render as unconstitutional and void under the doctrine of severability (constitutional parts of the law remain even if other parts are unconstitutional), as the Assignment by Kelantan gives to Petronas the ownership of all petroleum "whether lying onshore or offshore of Malaysia" was an overstatement, and Kelantan has no rights to what lies off the shores of the whole of Malaysia.

States cannot transfer rights over something they do not own. Unfortunately for Kelantan, the matter cannot end with the two agreements. There is a supreme Constitution in Malaysia with a federal-state division of legislative and financial powers. The constitutional allocation cannot be altered except by constitutionally permitted procedures and amendments. Even mutual agreements cannot override the constitutional scheme of things because jurisdiction is a matter of law and not of consent or acquiescence.<ref name="thestar" />

=== Current action ===
The Kelantan state government is owed between RM850 million and RM1 billion from oil revenue royalties from the central government, according to the Petroleum Act 1974. In 2009, the central government offered 'compensation' or ''Wang Ehsan'', a fraction of the sum actually owed. Discrimination of Kelantan on the matter has led the state government considering action in the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ). Support for Kelantan and the local government in defiance of the central government includes the group Kelantan Peoples' Movement Demanding Petroleum Royalties or ''Gerakan Menuntut Royalti Petroleum Rakyat Kelantan (GMR).''

The largely rural state preserves Malay traditions such as kite-flying contests, top-spinning contests, and bird singing competitions, and traditional handicrafts such as [[batik]], [[songket]], and silver crafts. Kelantan's ethnic composition is 95.7% Malay, 3.4% Chinese, 0.3% Indian and 0.6% others.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kelantan (State, Malaysia) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map and Location |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/malaysia/admin/03__kelantan/ |access-date=15 April 2022 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref>

The ethnicities of Kelantan generally live together harmoniously. For example, members of the Thai community received a permit to build a very large statue of the Buddha without any objection from the Malay community or the PAS government that granted the permit.

=== Ethnic groups ===

==== Malays ====
[[File:Masjid Tengku Muhammad Faiz Petra (346904242).jpg|200px|thumb|right|Tengku Muhammad Faiz Petra Mosque.]]
[[Kelantanese Malays]] are the predominant ethnic group in the state. They speak Kelantanese Malay which is distinguished from standard Malay as well as other Malay varieties in Malaysia by its unique grammar, pronunciation and figures of speech.

Kelantanese Malay is somewhat [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with other Malay dialects. [[Jawi script]], which has less influence in other parts of Malaysia, is still widely used in writing and printing the Malay language in Kelantan. Signboards in Kelantan are written in both Jawi and Rumi. To a certain extent, the Southern Thai language is also used.

95.7% of Kelantan's population are ethnic Malays, and under the Malaysian Constitution, all Malays are Muslims; therefore, Islam is the largest religion in the state.

Kota Bharu, as the state capital, is a popular centre for pursuits such as [[silat]], [[martial arts]], and ''kertok'' drumming. Here, too, more than any other place in Malaysia, the traditional pastimes of top-spinning — known as ''gasing'' — and the flying of giant, elaborately decorated kites called ''wau'', is still observed.

==== Siamese ====
{{Main|Malaysian Siamese}}
[[File:Reclining Buddha in a Thai Buddhist temple in Kelantan.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Reclining Buddha in Wat Photivihan.]]
The minority ethnic Malaysian Siamese inhabitants of Kelantan are mostly centred around the coastal town of [[Tumpat District|Tumpat]], which is home to most of the state's two hundred or so Buddhist temples, and has a number of relatively well-off Siamese villages.

The dialect of the [[Thai language]] spoken in Kelantan is called ''Tak Bai'', after the southernmost coastal town [[Tak Bai]] of [[Narathiwat province]], just across the [[Kolok River|Golok River]] from Malaysia. The ''Tak Bai'' dialect differs substantially from standard southern Thai and other regional Thai dialects, and it seems certain that the Kelantan Thais are the descendants of an original enclave of [[Narathiwat]] settlers established in sparsely populated Malay territory as long as four centuries ago.

Buddhism is also visible in the hundreds of Thai [[wat]]s, also known as ''ketik'', found throughout the state. Since 1980, the longest statue of a reclining Buddha in [[Southeast Asia]] can be found in [[Wat Photivihan]], in [[Tumpat District|Tumpat]]. This temple is very popular with pilgrims and devotees. The ''Metta'' chanting uses the original [[Pali]] language or a Thai translation. About a thousand visitors attend the Wat for such religious celebrations as Tok'katinna, [[Loy Krathong]], Saibat and [[Songkran (Thailand)|Songkran]].

==== Chinese ====
{{cleanup section|reason=need to (1) improve grammar; (2) remove duplicate wikilinks; (3) format foreign terms and names consistently; (4) cite reliable sources |date=July 2019}}
In Kelantan, the [[Malaysian Chinese|Kelantanese Chinese]] see themselves as either Cino [[Kampung|Kapong]] (village Chinese) or Cino Bandar (town Chinese). Famous Chinese villages in Kelantan include [[Kampung Tok'kong]] (300-year-old temple), Batu Jong, Kampung Jelatok, Kampung Joh, Kampung Temangan, Kampung Mata Ayer, Kampung Tawang, [[Kampung Balai]], and [[Gua Musang District|Gua Musang]]. Descendants of the earlier waves of small-scale migration are known as Oghe Cino kito (our very own Chinese) and the elders are seen as Oghe Kelate beto (true Kelantanese).

[[Peranakan Chinese|Cina Kampung]] assimilation in Kelantan is manifested as: "Malay behaviour as frontstage and Chinese behaviour as backstage". "Frontstage" or public behaviour includes speaking Kelantanese Malay even when among themselves, adopting Malay-style clothing, and observing certain Malay customs and holidays. "Backstage" or private behaviour includes maintaining certain traditional Chinese beliefs and customs confined only within the home.<ref>Teo, Kok Seong, 2003. The Peranakan Chinese of Kelantan. England: Asian Academic Press.</ref> A pattern which they also associate as [[Peranakan Chinese]], nonetheless they are culturally different in some ways from the Strait-Chinese Peranakan of Malacca, [[Penang]] and [[Singapore]] or even the Indonesian Peranakans.

The [[Peranakan Chinese|Cina Kampung]] in Kelantan have native speaker competence in the Kelantanese dialect. It is impossible to tell a Malay from a Chinese here just by listening to their speech in the [[Kelantanese dialect]].{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

Much of Chinese culture still continues until today; such as the [[lion dance]] and [[dragon dance]] during [[Chinese New Year]], temple celebration, eating bakchang (meat dumpling), [[mooncake]], baby fullmoon, pulut kuning, telur merah, eat 'e' ([[tangyuan (food)|tangyuan]]), religious celebration including praying to the [[Na Tuk Kong]]. They also cook 'bak hong', 'uang (meatball)' during wedding ceremonies and 'kiam mai' during funerals.

The village of Kampung Tok'kong in the Kelantan state of Malaysian is well known for a historically significant Chinese temple known as Seng Choon Kiong. 25&nbsp;km from Kota Bharu, it is located within a paddy field village with a population of around 500 person. The temple is approximately 300 years old and is dedicated to the worship of the goddess [[Mazu]]. Every year on the equivalent date to 23 March on the Chinese calendar, the birthday of Mazu is commemorated with concerts, lion dance, carrying god ride 'Kheng kiu', 'siam hee' and also wayang kulit show for three days. Chinese and Mazu followers visit the temple to pay homage to Mazu, to offer prayers for health and wealth, as well as for personal safety and security and eat Kampung Tokkong most famous 'Bak hong'.

Unlike the Chinese in other parts of Malaysia, Kelantanese Chinese prefer to conduct their wedding party at home rather than at a restaurant. This reflects their mindset that their presence to celebrate the newly weds is more important than the wedding banquet. And also make it a gathering ceremony to celebrate the angsu 'red/ happiness'. The amount of guests relate to how respectable the house owner is. This is further proven by their generosity of the money gifts from the newly weds. Usually the wedding ceremony begins on Thursday night and proceeds until the next morning because the weekend holiday is Friday in Kelantan. For good luck, the groom has to bring home the bride before 12 noon on the Friday in a car decorated with flowers.

Most Chinese villagers bury their dead at the local town cemetery. Others cremate the dead at the nearest Wat. If the deceased was old, a three-day funeral ceremony and memorial is conducted, complete with chanting from the monks. But if the deceased was of the younger generation, they are either buried or cremated as soon as possible. They also offers prayers for anniversary for the death.

====Indians====
Indians are known to be one of the smallest ethnic groups in Kelantan. During British rule, Indians were brought in to Kelantan to work in rubber estates around Gua Musang District and [[Tanah Merah District|Tanah Merah]] as labourers.

==== Orang Asli ====

[[Orang Asli]], mostly Temiar people, are people who have lived in the forests of Kelantan and Perak for thousands of years. Some of the Temiar maintain traditional beliefs in their [[nature|natural]] surroundings and other forms of [[animist]] elements. Other ''Orang Asli'' ethnic groups that live in Kelantan are [[Jahai people|Jahais]], [[Batek people|Bateks]] and [[Mendriq]]s.

== Administrative divisions ==
=== Districts ===
Districts in Kelantan are called ''Jajahan''s, though actually the direct translation of ''Tanah Jajahan'' in Malay to English is 'Occupied Territories'. Kelantan was a divided feudal state, a common situation in the Malay Peninsula, with separate petty local rulers. However, a strong one managed to rise and conquer all these small petty territories. In the end, Kelantan became united under one Sultan. The eleven ''jajahans'', from top to bottom are written in [[Malay language|Rumi]] and Jawi:<ref>{{Cite web |title=Workbook: MyCenDash(English) |url=https://tableau.dosm.gov.my/t/BPPD-BahagianperangkaanpendudukdanDemografi/views/MyCenDashEnglish/DISTRICT?:display_count=n&:embed=y&:isGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&:origin=viz_share_link&:showAppBanner=false&:showVizHome=n |access-date=2022-12-22 |website=tableau.dosm.gov.my}}</ref>

==== Colek ====
Contrary to popular belief, Colek is not just a dipping sauce, but can also refer to a snack eaten with the sauce. Colek comes in various forms, including meaty cholek, colek ayam (chicken), colek perut (cow tripe), colek pelepong (cow or lamb lung; usually fried plain), and also a variety of colek buah (fruits; usually unmatured, thus crunchy and sour tasting) such as colek pauh ([[mango]]). 

Colek manis (with [[brown sugar]]) is a sweet, sour and very mildly hot version. This colek is different from other [[chili sauce]]s because colek is very thin and rather sweet. This dipping sauce is used for chicken, and also goes well with shrimp, [[fish cake]], [[spring roll]], [[sausage]], etc.

==== Budu ====
Budu (sauce) is a salted (fermented) anchovy sauce eaten mainly as flavouring with rice, [[Ikan bakar|grilled fish]] and vegetables/salads ([[ulam (salad)|ulam]]). A bit of lime juice, hot chilis and [[shallot]]s are added on for taste. Also, tempoyak (fermented [[durian]]) or fresh durian is added. Once combined, the purple-brownish condiment has a blend of salty and sour taste. Sometimes, budu is used in cooking as an ingredient.

Nowadays, other types of fish are also used to create budu. Famous budu making villages include Kg. Tawang, [[Bachok]] and Kg. Penambang near Kota Bharu.

Similar [[Fish sauce|sauces]] are found in the [[Philippines]] and [[Indochina]] ([[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]]).

=== Thai-influenced dishes ===

==== Somtam ====
[[Somtam]] is a [[green papaya]] salad with a salty, spicy, and sour taste. The main items in it are young, unripe [[papaya]], [[soy sauce]], groundnuts, fish sauce, [[lime juice]], and [[chili pepper|chilies]]. These items are combined in a mortar, pounded with a pestle for few seconds and served. The salty and lime juicy taste is very popular. This light dish is widely available in regions with large numbers of ethnic Thais, such as [[Tumpat District|Tumpat]] and [[wat|Siamese wats]].
