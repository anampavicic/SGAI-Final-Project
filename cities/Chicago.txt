The name ''Chicago'' is derived from a French rendering of the [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous]] [[Miami–Illinois language|Miami–Illinois]] word {{lang|mia|shikaakwa}} for a wild relative of the [[onion]]; it is known to botanists as ''[[Allium tricoccum]]'' and known more commonly as "ramps". The first known reference to the site of the current city of Chicago as "{{lang|fr|Checagou}}" was by [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|Robert de&nbsp;LaSalle]] around 1679 in a memoir.<ref>{{cite book |last=Quaife |first=Milo M. |title=Checagou: From Indian Wigwam to Modern City, 1673–1835 |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.151734 |year=1933 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, IL |oclc=1865758}}</ref> [[Henri Joutel]], in his journal of 1688, noted that the eponymous wild "garlic" grew profusely in the area.<ref name="Swenson, John F. 235–248">{{Cite journal |author=Swenson, John F. |title=Chicagoua/Chicago: The origin, meaning, and etymology of a place name |journal=Illinois Historical Journal |volume=84 |issue=4 |date=Winter 1991 |pages=235–248 |issn=0748-8149 |oclc=25174749}}</ref> According to his diary of late September 1687:

The first known permanent settler in Chicago was trader [[Jean Baptiste Point du Sable]]. Du Sable was of [[African people|African]] descent, perhaps born in the [[List of French possessions and colonies|French colony]] of [[Saint-Domingue]] (Haiti), and established the settlement in the 1780s. He is commonly known as the "Founder of Chicago."{{sfnp|Genzen|2007|pp=10–11, 14–15}}{{sfnp|Keating|2005|pp=30–31, 221}}<ref name="Swenson">{{cite web |last=Swenson |first=John W |year=1999 |title=Jean Baptiste Point de Sable—The Founder of Modern Chicago |url=http://www.earlychicago.com/essays.php?essay=7 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050116080031/http://www.earlychicago.com/essays.php?essay=7 |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 16, 2005 |work=Early Chicago |publisher=Early Chicago, Inc. |access-date=August 8, 2010 }}</ref>

In 1795, following the victory of the new United States in the [[Northwest Indian War]], an area that was to be part of Chicago was turned over to the U.S. for a military post by native tribes in accordance with the [[Treaty of Greenville]]. In 1803, the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] constructed [[Fort Dearborn]], which was destroyed during the [[War of 1812]] in the [[Battle of Fort Dearborn]] by the Potawatomi before being later rebuilt.{{sfnp|Genzen|2007|pp=16–17}}

After the War of 1812, the [[Odawa people|Ottawa]], [[Ojibwe]], and Potawatomi tribes ceded additional land to the United States in the 1816 [[Treaty of St. Louis (1816)|Treaty of St. Louis]]. The Potawatomi were forcibly removed from their land after the [[1833 Treaty of Chicago]] and sent west of the [[Mississippi River]] as part of the federal policy of [[Indian removal]].{{sfnp|Buisseret|1990|pp=22–23, 68, 80–81}}{{sfnp|Keating|2005|pp=30–32}}<ref name="Timeline: Early Chicago History">{{cite web |title=Timeline: Early Chicago History |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/chicago/timeline/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325102159/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/chicago/timeline/index.html |work=Chicago: City of the Century |publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation And Window to the World Communications, Inc. |archive-date=March 25, 2009 |year=2003 |access-date=May 26, 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>

As the site of the [[Chicago Portage]],{{sfnp|Keating|2005|p=27}} the city became an important transportation hub between the eastern and western United States. Chicago's first railway, [[Galena and Chicago Union Railroad]], and the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]] opened in 1848. The canal allowed [[steamboat]]s and [[sailing ship]]s on the [[Great Lakes]] to connect to the Mississippi River.{{sfnp|Buisseret|1990|pp=86–98}}{{sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=30–31}}{{sfnp|Genzen|2007|pp=24–25}}{{sfnp|Keating|2005|pp=26–29, 35–39}}

A flourishing economy brought residents from rural communities and [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] from abroad. Manufacturing and retail and finance sectors became dominant, influencing the [[American economy]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Conzen |first=Michael P. |chapter=Global Chicago |chapter-url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/300132.html |title=Encyclopedia of Chicago |publisher=Chicago Historical Society |access-date=December 6, 2015 |archive-date=November 12, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151112152124/http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/300132.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Chicago Board of Trade]] (established 1848) listed the first-ever standardized "exchange-traded" forward contracts, which were called [[futures contract]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmegroup.com/company/history/timeline-of-achievements.html |title=Timeline-of-achievements |publisher=[[CME Group]] |access-date=January 20, 2013 |archive-date=January 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107030442/http://www.cmegroup.com/company/history/timeline-of-achievements.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Lincoln was nominated in Chicago for U.S. president at the [[1860 Republican National Convention]], which was held in a purpose-built auditorium called the [[Wigwam (Chicago)|Wigwam]]. He defeated Douglas in the general election, and this set the stage for the [[American Civil War]].

To accommodate [[#Demographics|rapid population growth]] and demand for better sanitation, the city improved its infrastructure. In February 1856, Chicago's Common Council approved [[Ellis S.

The city responded by tunneling {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} out into Lake Michigan to newly built [[Water cribs in Chicago|water cribs]]. In 1900, the problem of sewage contamination was largely resolved when the city completed a major engineering feat. It reversed the flow of the Chicago River so that the water flowed away from Lake Michigan rather than into it. This project began with the construction and improvement of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, and was completed with the [[Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal]] that connects to the [[Illinois River]], which flows into the Mississippi River.{{sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=15–18, 243–245}}{{sfnp|Genzen|2007|pp=27–29, 38–43}}{{sfnp|Buisseret|1990|pp=154–155, 172–173, 204–205}}

The city grew significantly in size and population by incorporating many neighboring townships between 1851 and 1920, with the largest annexation happening in 1889, with five townships joining the city, including the [[Hyde Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Hyde Park Township]], which now comprises most of the [[South Side of Chicago]] and the far southeast of Chicago, and the [[Jefferson Township, Cook County, Illinois|Jefferson Township]], which now makes up most of [[Northwest Side, Chicago|Chicago's Northwest Side]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/53.html |access-date=December 14, 2015 |year=2005 |encyclopedia=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago |publisher=Chicago Historical Society |author=Cain, Louis P. |title=Annexations}}</ref> The desire to join the city was driven by municipal services that the city could provide its residents.

Chicago's flourishing economy attracted huge numbers of new immigrants from [[Europe]] and migrants from the [[Eastern United States]].

[[Labor history of the United States|Labor conflicts]] followed the industrial boom and the rapid expansion of the labor pool, including the [[Haymarket affair]] on May 4, 1886, and in 1894 the [[Pullman Strike]]. Anarchist and socialist groups played prominent roles in creating very large and highly organized labor actions.

During the 1870s and 1880s, Chicago attained national stature as the leader in the movement to improve public health. City laws and later, state laws that upgraded standards for the medical profession and fought urban epidemics of [[cholera]], [[smallpox]], and [[yellow fever]] were both passed and enforced. These laws became templates for public health reform in other cities and states.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Clinton |last=Sandvick |year=2009 |title=Enforcing Medical Licensing in Illinois: 1877–1890 |journal=Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=67–74 |pmid=19562006 |pmc=2701151}}</ref>

The city established many large, well-landscaped [[Chicago Park District|municipal parks]], which also included public sanitation facilities. The chief advocate for improving public health in Chicago was [[John Henry Rauch|John H. Rauch, M.D.]] Rauch established a plan for Chicago's park system in 1866. He created [[Lincoln Park]] by closing a cemetery filled with shallow graves, and in 1867, in response to an outbreak of cholera he helped establish a new Chicago Board of Health. Ten years later, he became the secretary and then the president of the first Illinois State Board of Health, which carried out most of its activities in Chicago.<ref>{{cite journal |first=William K. |last=Beatty |year=1991 |title=John H.

The ratification of the 18th amendment to the Constitution in 1919 made the production and sale (including exportation) of alcoholic beverages illegal in the United States.

Chicago is located in northeastern Illinois on the southwestern shores of freshwater Lake Michigan. It is the principal city in the [[Chicago Metropolitan Area]], situated in both the [[Midwestern United States]] and the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]]. The city rests on a [[continental divide]] at the site of the Chicago Portage, connecting the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes [[drainage basin|watersheds]]. In addition to it lying beside Lake Michigan, two rivers—the Chicago River in downtown and the [[Calumet River]] in the industrial far South Side—flow either entirely or partially through the city.{{sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=5–6}}{{sfnp|Genzen|2007|pp=6–9}}

Chicago's history and economy are closely tied to its proximity to Lake Michigan. While the Chicago River historically handled much of the region's waterborne cargo, today's huge [[lake freighter]]s use the city's [[Port of Chicago|Lake Calumet Harbor]] on the South Side. The lake also provides another positive effect: moderating Chicago's climate, making waterfront neighborhoods slightly warmer in winter and cooler in summer.<ref>{{cite web |last=Angel |first=Jim |title=State Climatologist Office for Illinois |url=http://www.isws.illinois.edu/atmos/statecli/general/chicago-climate-narrative.htm |work=Illinois State Water Survey |publisher=[[Prairie Research Institute]] |access-date=August 4, 2013 |archive-date=July 24, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724032003/http://www.isws.illinois.edu/atmos/statecli/General/chicago-climate-narrative.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Streetscape===
{{main|Roads and expressways in Chicago}}
Chicago's streets were laid out in a [[Grid plan|street grid]] that grew from the city's original townsite plot, which was bounded by Lake Michigan on the east, North Avenue on the north, Wood Street on the west, and 22nd Street on the south.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wbez.org/series/curious-city/gulp-how-chicago-gobbled-its-neighbors-109583 |title=Gulp!

As new additions to the city were platted, city ordinance required them to be laid out with eight streets to the mile in one direction and sixteen in the other direction, about one street per 200 meters in one direction and one street per 100 meters in the other direction. The grid's regularity provided an efficient means of developing new real estate property.

During its first hundred years, Chicago was one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. When founded in 1833, fewer than 200 people had settled on what was then the American frontier. By the time of its first census, seven years later, the population had reached over 4,000. In the forty years from 1850 to 1890, the city's population grew from slightly under 30,000 to over 1&nbsp;million.

The city's distinctive accent, made famous by its use in classic films like ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' and television programs like the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' skit "[[Bill Swerski's Superfans]]", is an advanced form of [[Inland Northern American English]]. This dialect can also be found in other cities bordering the Great Lakes such as [[Cleveland]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Detroit]], and [[Rochester, New York]], and most prominently features a rearrangement of certain vowel sounds, such as the [[Phonological history of English short A|short 'a']] sound as in "cat", which can sound more like "kyet" to outsiders.

Chicago literature finds its roots in the city's tradition of lucid, direct journalism, lending to a strong tradition of [[social realism]]. In the ''[[Encyclopedia of Chicago]]'', [[Northwestern University]] Professor Bill Savage describes Chicago fiction as prose which tries to "capture the essence of the city, its spaces and its people." The challenge for early writers was that Chicago was a frontier outpost that transformed into a global metropolis in the span of two generations. Narrative fiction of that time, much of it in the style of "high-flown romance" and "genteel realism", needed a new approach to describe the urban social, political, and economic conditions of Chicago.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/448.html |title=Fiction |work=chicagohistory.org |access-date=August 9, 2012 |archive-date=January 18, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220118043823/http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/448.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Nonetheless, Chicagoans worked hard to create a literary tradition that would stand the test of time,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/755.html |title=Literary Cultures |work=chicagohistory.org |access-date=August 9, 2012 |archive-date=October 11, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221011210402/http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/755.html |url-status=live }}</ref> and create a "city of feeling" out of concrete, steel, vast lake, and open prairie.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1390.html |title=Literary Images of Chicago |work=chicagohistory.org |access-date=August 9, 2012 |archive-date=October 8, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221008200636/http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1390.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Much notable Chicago fiction focuses on the city itself, with social criticism keeping exultation in check.

The government of the City of Chicago is divided into executive and [[legislature|legislative]] branches. The [[mayor of Chicago]] is the chief executive, elected by general election for a term of four years, with no term limits. The current mayor is [[Brandon Johnson]]. The mayor appoints commissioners and other officials who oversee the various departments. As well as the mayor, Chicago's clerk and treasurer are also elected citywide. The [[Chicago City Council|City Council]] is the legislative branch and is made up of 50 alderpersons, one elected from each [[wards of the United States|ward]] in the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=City Council, Your Ward & Alderperson |url=https://www.chicago.gov/content/city/en/about/council.html |access-date=2023-12-10 |website=chicago.gov |language=en}}</ref> The council takes official action through the passage of [[local ordinance|ordinances]] and resolutions and approves the city budget.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chicago Government |url=http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/chicagogovt.html |work=City of Chicago |access-date=October 13, 2013 |archive-date=November 11, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181111074509/https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/chicagogovt.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Chicago Police Department]] provides law enforcement and the [[Chicago Fire Department]] provides fire suppression and emergency medical services for the city and its residents. Civil and criminal law cases are heard in the [[Cook County Circuit Court]] of the State of Illinois court system, or in the [[Northern District of Illinois]], in the federal system. In the state court, the public prosecutor is the Illinois [[state's attorney]]; in the Federal court it is the United States [[District Attorney|attorney]].

During much of the last half of the 19th century, Chicago's politics were dominated by a growing [[Cook County Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] organization. During the 1880s and 1890s, Chicago had a powerful radical tradition with large and highly organized [[socialist]], [[anarchist]] and [[labor organization]]s.{{sfnp|Schneirov|1998|pp=173–174}} For much of the 20th century, Chicago has been among the largest and most reliable Democratic strongholds in the United States; with Chicago's Democratic vote the state of Illinois has been "[[Red states and blue states|solid blue]]" in [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]] since 1992. Even before then, it was not unheard of for Republican presidential candidates to win handily in downstate Illinois, only to lose statewide due to large Democratic margins in Chicago. The citizens of Chicago have not elected a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] mayor since 1927, when [[William Hale Thompson|William Thompson]] was voted into office. The strength of the party in the city is partly a consequence of Illinois state politics, where the Republicans have come to represent rural and farm concerns while the Democrats support urban issues such as Chicago's public school funding.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

Chicago contains less than 25% of the state's population, but it is split between eight of Illinois' 17 [[Illinois's congressional districts|districts]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. All eight of the city's representatives are Democrats; only two Republicans have represented a significant portion of the city since 1973, for one term each: [[Robert P. Hanrahan]] from 1973 to 1975, and [[Michael Patrick Flanagan]] from 1995 to 1997.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

[[Machine politics]] persisted in Chicago after the decline of similar machines in other large U.S. cities.{{sfnp|Montejano|1999|pp=33–34}} During much of that time, the city administration found opposition mainly from a liberal "independent" faction of the Democratic Party. The independents finally gained control of city government in 1983 with the election of [[Harold Washington]] (in office 1983–1987). From 1989 until May 16, 2011, Chicago was under the leadership of its longest-serving mayor, [[Richard M. Daley]], the son of Richard J. Daley. Because of the dominance of the Democratic Party in Chicago, the Democratic [[Partisan primary|primary]] vote held in the spring is generally more significant than the general elections in November for U.S. House and Illinois State seats. The aldermanic, mayoral, and other city offices are filled through nonpartisan elections with runoffs as needed.<ref>{{Cite web |title=7 big ideas for making Illinois more (small-d) democratic – CHANGE Illinois |date=March 28, 2022 |url=https://www.changeil.org/2022/03/7-big-ideas-for-making-illinois-more-small-d-democratic/ |access-date=June 18, 2022 |archive-date=August 16, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220816041513/https://www.changeil.org/2022/03/7-big-ideas-for-making-illinois-more-small-d-democratic/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Transit systems====
[[File:Chicago union station hall.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Chicago Union Station]], opened in 1925, is the third-busiest passenger rail terminal in the United States.]]
The [[Regional Transportation Authority (Illinois)|Regional Transportation Authority]] (RTA) coordinates the operation of the three service boards: CTA, Metra, and Pace.
* The [[Chicago Transit Authority]] (CTA) handles public transportation in the City of Chicago and a few adjacent suburbs outside of the Chicago city limits. The CTA operates an extensive network of buses and a [[rapid transit]] elevated and subway system known as [[Chicago "L"|the Chicago "L" or just the "L"]] (short for "elevated"), with lines designated by colors. These rapid transit lines also serve both [[Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway]] and O'Hare Airports. The CTA's rail lines consist of the [[Red Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Red]], [[Blue Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Blue]], [[Green Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Green]], [[Orange Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Orange]], [[Brown Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Brown]], [[Purple Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Purple]], [[Pink Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Pink]], and [[Yellow Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Yellow]] lines. Both the Red and Blue lines offer 24‑hour service which makes Chicago one of a handful of cities around the world (and one of two in the United States, the other being New York City) to offer rail service 24 hours a day, every day of the year, within the city's limits.
* [[Metra]], the nation's second-most used passenger regional rail network, operates an 11-line [[commuter rail]] service in Chicago and throughout the Chicago suburbs. The [[Metra Electric Line]] shares its trackage with Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District's [[South Shore Line (NICTD)|South Shore Line]], which provides commuter service between [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] and Chicago.
* [[Pace (transit)|Pace]] provides bus and [[paratransit]] service in over 200 surrounding suburbs with some extensions into the city as well. A 2005 study found that one quarter of commuters used public transit.<ref>[https://money.cnn.com/2007/06/13/real_estate/public_transit_commutes/index.htm "New Yorkers are top transit users"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516222801/http://money.cnn.com/2007/06/13/real_estate/public_transit_commutes/index.htm |date=May 16, 2008 }}, by Les Christie,''CNNmoney.com'', June 29, 2007.

[[Greyhound Lines]] provides inter-city bus service to and from the city at the [[Chicago Bus Station]], and Chicago is also the hub for the Midwest network of [[Megabus (North America)]].

Electricity for most of [[northern Illinois]] is provided by [[Commonwealth Edison]], also known as ComEd. Their service territory borders [[Iroquois County, Illinois|Iroquois County]] to the south, the [[Wisconsin]] border to the north, the [[Iowa]] border to the west and the [[Indiana]] border to the east. In northern Illinois, ComEd (a division of [[Exelon]]) operates the greatest number of nuclear generating plants in any U.S. state. Because of this, ComEd reports indicate that Chicago receives about 75% of its electricity from nuclear power. Recently, the city began installing wind turbines on government buildings to promote renewable energy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iit.edu/~ipro307f/faq.html |title=IIT.edu |publisher=IIT.edu |date=June 20, 2003 |access-date=May 4, 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080605021018/http://www.iit.edu/~ipro307f/faq.html |archive-date = June 5, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kentlaw.edu/news/advisory/adv030707.html |title=KentLaw.edu |publisher=KentLaw.edu |access-date=May 4, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203000/http://www.kentlaw.edu/news/advisory/adv030707.html |archive-date=September 27, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author1=Martin LaMonica Staff Writer |author2=CNET News |url=http://news.cnet.com/Micro+wind+turbines+are+coming+to+town/2100-11398_3-6037539.html |title='Micro' wind turbines are coming to town &#124; CNET News.com |publisher=CNET |access-date=May 4, 2009 |archive-date=July 9, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230709113341/https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/micro-wind-turbines-are-coming-to-town/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
