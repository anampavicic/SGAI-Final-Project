'''Bucheon''' ({{Korean|hangul=부천}}; {{IPA|ko|pu.tɕʰʌn}}) is a [[administrative divisions of South Korea|city]] in [[Gyeonggi Province]], South Korea. Bucheon is located {{convert|25|km|0|sp=us}} away from [[Seoul]], of which it is a [[satellite town|satellite city]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://ngo.cier.edu.tw/policy/2.3.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630012653/http://ngo.cier.edu.tw/policy/2.3.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-06-30|title=3.Urbanization and its Impact on Seoul, Korea|series=Urbanization, East Asia and Habitat II|editor=Ian Douglas, Shu-Li Huang|author=Hae Un Rii, Jae-Seob Ahn|access-date=2016-02-17|publisher=Taiwan NGO Professionalization Watch}}</ref> It is located between [[Incheon]] and [[Seoul]].

Bucheon is the second most densely populated city in South Korea after Seoul,<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://news.heraldcorp.com/view.php?ud=20160516000533 |script-title=ko:부천시, 상동 영상단지 내 초대형 신세계 복합쇼핑몰 건립 '논란'… 시민단체 '반발'|date=16 May 2016}}</ref> and as a result, administrative districts were abolished in July 2016 in favor of providing greater public service in community centers.<ref name="auto"/>

Major manufacturing operations are located in the northern areas of the city, while the areas in the south where [[Seoul Subway Line 7]] and [[Seoul Subway Line 1]] pass are dense commercial and residential areas.

== History ==
In 1914, the outer areas of [[Incheon]] (including Gwangyo-dong, old Incheon's city center) and [[Bupyeong District#History of "old Bupyeong"|Bupyeong County]] were joined under the name ''Bucheon''. In 1931, Gyenam township (''myeon'', 계남면) was renamed Sosa township (''myeon'', 소사면). In 1936, the westernmost part of Bucheon, then part of old Incheon, was incorporated in Incheon City and in 1940 some other part of old Incheon belonging to Bucheon Country was incorporated in Incheon again while part of old Bupyeong was annexed to Incheon at the same time. In 1941, Sosa township promoted to ''eup'' (town) status.<ref>{{cite web

In 1988, two districts were established. Bucheon was divided into Nam-gu ("south", {{Korean|남구|labels=no}}) and Jung-gu ("central", {{Korean|중구|labels=no}}) along the Seoul-Incheon trainline. Present day Sosa-gu was formerly called Nam-gu.

In 1993, Bucheon's Jung-gu was separated into two further districts, forming [[Wonmi-gu|Wonmi]] ({{Korean|원미구|labels=no}}) and [[Ojeong-gu|Ojeong]] ({{Korean|오정구|labels=no}}) Districts.

The three districts were abolished in July 2016 as Bucheon decided to become a unified city without any administrative districts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.incheonilbo.com/?mod=news&act=articleView&idxno=716745 |script-title=ko:부천시 '구 폐지' 효과 벌써 벤치마킹|date=13 July 2016}}</ref> However, on January 1, 2024, the Bucheon municipal government decided to return the three districts, along with the creation of 37 new administrative districts (or [[Dong (administrative division)|dongs]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.welfarehello.com/community/hometownNews/10409a23-cf14-446c-a1db-67800bf2f61b|script-title=ko:2024년 1월 1일부터 달라지는 부천의 모습!|website=Wello!|access-date=2024-10-10|language=ko}}</ref>
