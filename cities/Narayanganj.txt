'''Narayanganj''' ({{langx|bn|নারায়ণগঞ্জ|translit=Narayongônjo}}) is a city in central [[Bangladesh]] in the [[Greater Dhaka]] area. It is in the [[Narayanganj District]], about {{cvt|16|km|mi|0}} southeast of the capital city of [[Dhaka]]. With a population of almost 1 million, it is the 6th largest city in Bangladesh.<ref name=":0">{{Cite Banglapedia|last=Solaiman|first=Md.|article=Narayanganj}}</ref> It is also a center of business and industry, especially the [[jute]] trade and processing plants, and the textile sector of the country. It is nicknamed the [[Dundee]] of Bangladesh, due to the presence of its many jute mills. (Dundee was the first industrialised 'Juteopolis' in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dundee.ac.uk/archives/voicesofdundeeoralhistoryproject/juteindundeeindia/|title=Jute Industry in Dundee and India|publisher=Dundee (UK)|access-date=2017-12-20|archive-date=2017-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415085440/https://www.dundee.ac.uk/archives/voicesofdundeeoralhistoryproject/juteindundeeindia/|url-status=dead}}</ref>)

==History==

The city got its name from Bicon Lal Pandey, a [[Hindu]] religious leader who was also known as Benur Thakur or 'Lakshmi Narayan Thakur'. He leased the area from the [[British East India Company]] in 1766 following the [[Battle of Plassey]]. He donated the markets and the land on the banks of the river as ''Devottor'' or 'Given to God' property, bequeathed for maintenance expenses for the worship of the god [[Narayana|Narayan]].

A post office was set up in 1866, and Dhaka-Narayanganj [[telegraph]] service was started in 1877. The Bank of Bengal introduced the first telephone service in 1882.
