'''Hildesheim''' ({{IPA|de|ˈhɪldəsˌhaɪm|lang|De-Hildesheim.ogg}}; {{langx|nds|Hilmessen}} or {{lang|nds|Hilmssen}}; {{langx|la|Hildesia}}) is a city in [[Lower Saxony]], in north-central [[Germany]] with 101,693 inhabitants.<ref>https://www.hildesheim.de/pics/verwaltung/1_1549983673/Bevoelkerung_der_Stadt_Hildesheim_HW_31.12.2019.pdf {{Dead link|date=February 2022}}</ref> It is in the district of [[Hildesheim (district)|Hildesheim]], about {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Hanover]] on the banks of the [[Innerste]] River, a small tributary of the [[Leine]] River.

The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Louis the Pious]] founded the Bishopric of Hildesheim in 815 and created the first settlement with a chapel on the so-called ''Domhügel''.

Hildesheim is situated on the north–south [[Bundesautobahn 7|Autobahn 7]], and hence is connected with  Hamburg in the north and Austria in the south.

With the [[Hildesheim Cathedral]] and the [[St. Michael's Church, Hildesheim|St. Michael's Church]], Hildesheim became a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1985.

In 2015 the city and the diocese celebrated their 1200th anniversary.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
According to tradition, the city was named after its founder ''Hildwin.<ref>Möglich wäre die Benennung nach Abt [[Hilduin von Saint-Denis]]: ''In seinem Kommentar zur „Fundatio“ und in Ergänzung einer schon früher geäußerten Annahme hat sich [[Wilhelm Berges|Berges]] auch um den Nachweis bemüht, den Namen Hildesheim, der zweifellos auf die Form ‚Hilduinesheim‘ zurückgeht, auf den bekannten Abt Hilduin von St.&nbsp;Denis, den Berater und (seit 818) Erzkanzler Ludwigs des Frommen, zurückzuführen. In der Tat ist wohl der mit dem Stammwort -heim verbundene Personenname fränkisch, und W.&nbsp;Berges hat darüber hinaus eine Reihe von Beispielen fränkischer Ortsbenennungen nach noch lebenden Personen beibringen können. So hat sein Vorschlag einige Wahrscheinlichkeit für sich, zumal darüber hinaus die Möglichkeit bestände, dass auch die in der erwähnten Fraternitätsliste des Hildesheimer Domkapitelsgedenkbuchs (…) unmittelbar auf die ''mater'' Reims folgende Verbrüderung mit einer (ecclesia) ''Parisiensis in Francia'' auf die Verbindung mit Hilduin zurückgehen könnte. Und daß Hilduin und [[Gunthar von Hildesheim|Gunthar]] möglicherweise miteinander verwandt waren, wird nicht völlig ausgeschlossen werden können.'' Hans Goetting: ''Germania Sacra,'' Neue Folge 20, Berlin 1984, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hchlhyVQYyIC&dq=%22Hildewin+von%22&pg=PA580 S.&nbsp;40.] Berges gibt auch die Möglichkeit zu bedenken, dass der in der Gründungslegende erwähnte ''[[Hofkapelle (Amt)|capellarius]]'' Ludwigs des Frommen dieser Hilduin gewesen sein könne (ebd., Anm.&nbsp;22).</ref>'' The city is one of the oldest cities in [[Northern Germany]], became the seat of the [[Bishopric of Hildesheim]] in 815 and may have been founded when the bishop moved from [[Elze]] to the [[ford (crossing)|ford]] across the River [[Innerste]], which was an important market on the [[Hellweg]] trade route. The settlement around the cathedral very quickly developed into a town and was granted [[Market town|market rights]] by [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto III]] in 983.<ref>Neigenfind, W.: ''Unsere schöne Stadt'', p.46. Hildesheim 1964.</ref> Originally the market was held in a street called ''Alter Markt'' (Old Market) which still exists today. The first marketplace was laid out around the church [[St. Andreas, Hildesheim|St. Andreas]]. When the city grew further, a larger market place became necessary. The present market place of Hildesheim was laid out at the beginning of the 13th century when the city had about 5,000 inhabitants.

=== Middle Ages ===
When Hildesheim obtained [[town privileges|city status]] in 1249, it was one of the biggest cities in Northern Germany.<ref>Neigenfind, W.: ''Unsere schöne Stadt'', p.38. Hildesheim 1964.</ref> For four centuries the clergy ruled Hildesheim, before a town Hall was built and the citizens gained some influence and independence. Construction of the present Town Hall started in 1268.<ref>Borck, Heinz-Günther: ''Der Marktplatz zu Hildesheim'', p.24. Hildesheim 1989.</ref> In 1367 Hildesheim became a member of the [[Hanseatic League]]. A war between the citizens and their bishop cost dearly in 1519–23 when they engaged in a feud.

=== Reformation to 17th century ===
Hildesheim became [[Lutheran]] in 1542, and only the cathedral and a few other buildings remained in Imperial (Roman Catholic) hands. Several villages around the city remained Roman Catholic as well.

During the [[Thirty Years' War]], Hildesheim was besieged and occupied several times: in 1628 and 1632 by imperial troops; and in 1634 by troops from Brunswick and Lüneburg.<ref>Gerhard Schön, Deutscher Münzkatalog 18. Jahrhundert, Hildesheim Stadt, Nr. 17</ref>

=== 19th century ===
In 1813, after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the town became part of the [[Kingdom of Hanover]], which was annexed by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] as a [[Province of Hanover|province]] after the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866. In 1868 a highly valuable trove of about 70 Roman silver vessels for eating and drinking, the so-called [[Hildesheim Treasure]], was unearthed by Prussian soldiers.

=== Early 20th century and World War II ===
[[File:SC 335309 - City square of Hildesheim, Germany. (52240573993).jpg|thumb|Hildesheim city square in April 1945]]

Early in [[World War II]], Nazi roundups of the Jewish population began, and hundreds of Hildesheim's Jews were sent to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. Hildesheim was the location of a [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]] subcamp of the Nazi prison in [[Celle]], and a subcamp of the [[Neuengamme concentration camp]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&tab=7&id=1826|title=Außenkommando des Zuchthauses Celle in Hildesheim|website=Bundesarchiv.de|access-date=9 January 2024|language=de}}</ref><ref name=ushm>{{cite book|last=Megargee|first=Geoffrey P.|year=2009|title=The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos 1933–1945. Volume I|publisher=Indiana University Press, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|pages=1147–1148|isbn=978-0-253-35328-3}}</ref> After the dissolution of the latter, the surviving prisoners were sent on a [[Death marches during the Holocaust|death march]] to [[Hanover|Ahlem]].<ref name=ushm/> The city was heavily damaged by [[Bombing of Hildesheim in World War II|British air raids]] in 1945, especially on 22 March. Although Hildesheim had little military significance, two months before the end of the war the historic city was [[Strategic bombing during World War II|bombed]] as part of Britain′s [[Area Bombing Directive]] in order to undermine German civilian morale. As a result, 29% of the houses were destroyed and 45% damaged, while only 26% of the houses remained undamaged. The centre, which had retained its medieval character until then, was almost leveled. Destruction in the city as a whole was estimated at 20 to 30 percent.<ref>http://archiv.nationalatlas.de/wp-content/art_pdf/Band5_88-91_archiv.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref> Around 200 out of 800 half timer framed houses survived.<ref>https://www.hildesheimer-geschichte.de/die-bauwerke/geb%C3%A4ude-und-bauwerke/ {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2024}}</ref>
 
During the war, valuable world heritage materials had been hidden in underground cellars. After the war and its aftermath, priority was given to rapid building of housing, and concrete structures took the place of the wrecked historic buildings. Most of the major churches – two of them now UNESCO World Heritage sites – were rebuilt in the original style soon after the war.

=== Late 20th century and present ===
In 1978, the [[University of Hildesheim]] was founded. In the 1980s a reconstruction of the historic centre began. Some of the unattractive concrete buildings around the market place were torn down and replaced by replicas of the original buildings. In the autumn of 2007, a decision was made to reconstruct the ''Umgestülpter Zuckerhut'' ([[Upended Sugarloaf, Hildesheim|Upended Sugarloaf]]), an iconic half-timbered house famous for its unusual shape. In 2015 the city and the diocese celebrates their 1200 anniversary with the [[Day of Lower Saxony]].

== Religions ==
In 1542 most of the inhabitants became Lutherans. Today, 28.5% of the inhabitants identify themselves as Roman Catholics ([[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hildesheim|Hildesheim Diocese]]) and 38.3% as Protestants ([[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover]]). 33.0% of the inhabitants are adherents of other religions or do not have a religion at all. Up until 2015 the [[Serbian Orthodox]] Bishop of Germany had his seat in Himmelsthür (a locality of Hildesheim), before the seat moved to Frankfurt and, in 2018, to Düsseldorf.

== Main sights ==
[[File: Hildesheim night.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed market square at night]]

* The ''Marktplatz'' ([[Historic Market Place, Hildesheim|historic market place]]) was reconstructed in 1984–1990 after its destruction in the March 1945 air raid. The more noteworthy buildings in the square are:

The foundations were reconstructed to give observers an idea of how large the synagogue was. The reddish brick building (built around 1840) opposite was the Jewish school.
* ''Mauritiuskirche'' (St. Maurice's Church), a Romanesque church (11th century) on a hill in the west of the city in the quarter of [[Moritzberg (Hildesheim)|Moritzberg]] with a cloister. The interior of the church is Baroque and the tower was added in 1765.

Originally, it belonged to a private house which was torn down at the end of the 19th century. The bay window was dismantled before and added to another house in the eastern part of Hildesheim which remained undamaged during World War II. From there, the bay window was removed when the house was remodelled and added to the school at the present site in 1972.<ref>Segers-Glocke, Christiane: ''Baudenkmale in Niedersachsen, Band 14.1. - Hildesheim'', p.109. Hameln 2007.</ref>
* Close to the ''Kaiserhaus'' (Emperor's house) the ''Alte Kemenate'', a noteworthy medieval store house reaching a height of 5.5&nbsp;meters, can be seen behind the school in the street Alter Markt. It has a rectangular basis measuring 6.5&nbsp;meters × 5.0&nbsp;meters and a cellar with a vaulted construction.<ref>Segers-Glocke, Christiane: ''Baudenkmale in Niedersachsen, Band 14.1. - Hildesheim'', p.108. Hameln 2007.</ref> The store house, one of the oldest profane buildings in Hildesheim, was built of [[sandstone]] in a Gothic style the 15th century. According to other sources it might be even older, i.e. built between the end of the 11th and the middle of the 13th century.<ref>''Stadtgeschichte auf dem Hinterhof''. - Hildesheimer Allgemeine Zeitung, 23 June 2009, p.9.</ref> The building has two floors. As it did not consist of wood it did not burn down in 1945, but was only damaged and immediately repaired after the war. From 1945 - 1951 it was used for residential purposes. The ''Alte Kemenate'' is not open to the public.
* St Magdalena's Church (''Magdalenenkirche'') is a small church with large [[lancet windows]] in the historic street Old Market (''Alter Markt'') which was consecrated in 1224. It was originally built in a Romanesque style, but enlarged and remodelled in Gothic style in 1456. It houses a wooden altar (about 1520) with carvings and other works of art. The small street Süsternstraße features a well-preserved part of the medieval city wall with a round tower. Opposite the church, a tall half-timbered house which was rebuilt in 1981 on the medieval city wall can be seen in the small side street Mühlenstraße. The façade is decorated with wood carvings.
* [[Magdalenengarten]], a Baroque park which was laid out in 1720–1725, is near St. Magdalena's Church. There are many different kinds of rose bush, a rose museum, pavilions, Baroque statues, a well-preserved part of the medieval city wall in it and even a vineyard yielding 100–200 bottles of wine per year. In spring a rare species of wild yellow tulip (tulipa sylvestris) blossoms in the western part of the park.
* [[St Bernward's Church, Hildesheim|St. Bernward's Church]], a [[Romanesque Revival architecture|neo-Romanesque]] church built 1905–1907, destroyed in 1945 and rebuilt from 1948 to 1949, houses a Gothic wooden altar [[retable]] dating from the beginning of the 15th century.
* A part of the medieval defence system consisting of a wall with moats and ramparts, built around the city in the 13th century, is well preserved. [[Kalenberger Graben]], an artificial lake, is a part of it. It is surrounded by a park. In April a rare species of wild yellow tulip (tulipa sylvestris) blossoms in the park.
* [[Steuerwald Castle, Hildesheim|Steuerwald Castle]] (''Burg Steuerwald'') in the north of the city, about {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} from the Market Place, was built 1310–13. Its tower (25&nbsp;m) was added in 1325. The chapel, dedicated to St Magdalena, was originally built in the Romanesque style and transformed into a Gothic chapel in 1507. Today it is used for weddings and concerts.
* [[Marienburg Castle, Hildesheim|Marienburg Castle]] (''Burg Marienburg'') is in the southeast of Hildesheim, about {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} from the Market Place. It was built 1346–1349.
* [[Sorsum]] is a former village in the West of Hildesheim which became a part of the city in 1974. There is a former domain, founded in the Middle Ages, which was transformed into a residential area after 2000. The pigeon tower, built in 1733, the large barn (1786) and the manor house dating from 1734 are the most notable sights in this rural part of Hildesheim.
* [[Marienrode Priory]] (''Kloster Marienrode'') is in the southwest of Hildesheim, about {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} from the Market Place. It was founded in 1125. The foundation stone of the present church was laid in 1412. The church was built in Gothic style with three naves and completed in 1462. The Baroque ridge turret was added in the 18th century. In the church, there are two noteworthy Baroque altars dating from 1750 approximately and a Gothic sandstone sculpture of Saint Mary which was made in 1460. The organ dates from the middle of the 18th century. A small chapel of the priory, Saint Cosmas and Damian, which was built in 1792, was converted into a small Protestant church in 1830. The priory was dissolved in 1806, but returned to the Catholic Church in 1986. Since 1988, it has again been operated by nuns. Near the monastery there is a large fishpond with a tall windmill built in 1839.

Other places of interest include the theatre, offering opera, operetta and musicals, drama, ballet and concerts.
