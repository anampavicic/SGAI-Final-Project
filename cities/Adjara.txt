'''Adjara''' ({{lang-ka|აჭარა}} ''Ach’ara'' {{IPA-ka|at͡ʃʼara||Adjara.ogg}}) or '''Achara''', officially known as the '''Autonomous Republic of Adjara''' ({{lang-ka|აჭარის ავტონომიური რესპუბლიკა}} ''Ach’aris Avt’onomiuri Resp’ublik’a'' {{IPAc-ka|აჭარის ავტონომიური რესპუბლიკა||Autonomous Republic of Adjara (KA).ogg}}), is a political-administrative region of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. It is in the country's southwestern corner, on the coast of the [[Black Sea]], near the foot of the [[Lesser Caucasus]] Mountains, north of [[Turkey]]. It is an important tourist destination and includes Georgia's second most populous city of [[Batumi]] as its capital. About 350,000 people live on its {{cvt|2,880|km2}}.

Adjara is home to the [[Adjarians]], a regional subgroup of [[Georgians]]. The name can be spelled in a number of ways: ''Ajara'', ''Ajaria'', ''Adjaria'', ''Adzharia'', ''Atchara'' and ''Achara''. Under the [[Soviet Union]], Adjara was part of the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]] as the [[Adjar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Adjarian ASSR]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/russian/const/36cons01.html|title=1936 Constitution of the USSR, Part I|work=bucknell.edu}}</ref> The autonomous status of Adjara is guaranteed under article 6 of the [[Treaty of Kars]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Nazaroff |first=Alexander |date=1922-11-01 |title=Russia's Treaty with Turkey |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/curh.1922.17.2.276 |journal=Current History |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=276–279 |doi=10.1525/curh.1922.17.2.276 |s2cid=251524942 |issn=0011-3530|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

== History ==
{{main|History of Adjara}}
Adjara was a part of Georgian polities, [[Colchis]] and [[Kingdom of Iberia (antiquity)|Caucasian Iberia]], since ancient times.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Morritt |first=Robert D. |date=2017 |title=Stones that Speak |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1EaBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA140 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publisher |isbn=9781443821766 |via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref><ref>Ronald G. Suny - The Making of the Georgian Nation. Indiana University Press. Page 8</ref> Colonized by [[Greeks]] in the 5th century BC, the region fell under Rome in the 2nd century BC. It became part of the [[Lazica]] before being incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Abkhazia]] in the 8th century AD, the latter led [[Kingdom of Georgia#Unification of the Georgian State|unification of Georgian monarchy]] in the 11th century.

[[Andrew the Apostle]], who is believed to be a missionary of the [[Mother of God]] to Georgia and founder of the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]], entered Georgia from Adjara region and first preached [[Christianity]] there.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://agenda.ge/en/news/2015/1036#gsc.tab=0|title=Orthodox Georgians celebrate the day of Andrew the Apostle|location=Tbilisi, Georgia|work=Agenda.ge |date=12 May 2015|access-date=2022-12-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://georgiatoday.ge/st-andrews-day-celebrated-in-georgia/|title=St. Andrew's Day Celebrated in Georgia|location=Tbilisi, Georgia|work=Georgia Today|date=12 May 2023|access-date=2022-12-07}}</ref>

Adjaria was occupied by several empires: the [[Achaemenid Empire|First Persian Empire]] (500 BC), [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuks]] (11th century), [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] (13th century), and [[Timurid Empire|Timurids]] (14th century).{{sfn|George|2009|p=99}}

=== Ottoman period ===
The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] conquered the area in 1614. Although, the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman millet system]] allowed its subjects extensive self-governance and [[religious freedom]], many Adjarians gradually chose to convert to [[Islam]] during the 200 years of Ottoman presence.{{sfn|George|2009|pp=99–100}}<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Bennigsen|first1=Alexandre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nO0NAQAAMAAJ|title=Muslims of the Soviet Empire: A Guide|last2=Wimbush|first2=S.

=== Russian Empire ===
The Ottomans were forced to cede Adjara to the expanding [[Russian Empire]] in 1878 under the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]].{{sfn|Sanikidze|2018|p=250}} The Berlin Treaty allowed [[Adjarians]] to leave for Turkey, keeping a provision of Section 6, article 21 of the [[Treaty of San Stefano]].{{sfn|Hoch|Kopeček|2011|p=7}}{{sfn|Sanikidze|2018|p=250}} Many Adjarians emigrated to Turkey.{{sfn|Hoch|Kopeček|2011|p=7}}{{sfn|Sanikidze|2018|p=250}} While the Russian authorities supported the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]'s missionary efforts, they also tried to win the loyalty of Adjarians by building mosques and madrassas and supporting the local Muslim clergy.{{sfn|Sanikidze|2018|p=250}} As a result, many Adjarians emigrants, called [[Muhacir]], came back to Adjara.{{sfn|Sanikidze|2018|p=250}} Within Russian imperial administrative division, Adjara was called [[Batumi okrug]], comprising [[Kutaisi Governorate]].
=== Soviet rule ===
In 1918, Georgia regained its independence as a [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|democratic republic]] and Adjara became part of it. However, in April 1918, the [[Ottoman Empire]] invaded Georgia and captured Batumi. On 4 June 1918, the [[Treaty of Batum]] was signed, under which Georgia was forced to cede Adjara to the Ottoman Empire.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Varshalomidze|first=Archil|date=2019|title=South-Western Georgia (Ajara) within the Geostrategic Interests of the Ottoman Empire in the First Quarter of XX Century|journal=Herald of Oriental Studies|url=https://hos.openjournals.ge/index.php/hos/article/download/2805/2955}}</ref> However, due to the Ottoman defeat in the First World War and the [[Treaty of Mudros]], the Ottomans soon withdrew the territory.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Saparov|first=Arsène|date=March 2012|title=Why Autonomy?

===Independent Georgia===
After the Georgian independence, [[Aslan Abashidze]] became the chairman of Adjaria's parliament, the Adjarian Supreme Soviet. Abashidze was initially appointed by the first Georgian president Zviad Gamsakhurdia in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|title=Adjara Celebrates Abashidze's Departure |date=6 May 2004 |url=https://civil.ge/archives/105875}}</ref> However, he later took advantage of the [[Georgian Civil War|civil war]] in the country and turned Adjara into the personal fiefdom, although it remained relatively prosperous enclave in an otherwise rather chaotic country.<ref name="Abash">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3683629.stm|title=Aslan Abashidze|publisher=BBC|language=English|date=4 May 2004|access-date=11 November 2021}}</ref> During the [[1991–1992 Georgian coup d'état]] which ousted Gamsakhurdia from power, Abashidze declared a [[state of emergency]] in Adjara, closing its borders and shutting down the Adjarian Supreme Soviet. In response to pressure from the Adjarian opposition led by [[Republican Party of Georgia]], Georgia's new leader [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] met Aslan Abashidze in Batumi and persuaded him to resume the Supreme Soviet sessions in May 1992. However, the opposition failed to oust Abashidze. While Shevardnadze could easily sway certain members of Adjarian Supreme Soviet against Abashidze, he did not do so. Being brought to power through the coup launched by the militia leaders [[Jaba Ioseliani]] and [[Tengiz Kitovani]], Shevardnadze saw Abashidze as an useful counterweight against these warlords.<ref name="wheatley"/>

Further exploiting the instability, at this time brought by the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–1993)|War in Abkhazia]], Abashidze moved to further consolidate his power. During the summer of 1992, Abashidze appointed a seven-member Presidium of the Adjarian Supreme Soviet, made up of his supporters, and ruled by decree through this body. The Supreme Soviet, on the other hand, practically ceased to convene. Abashidze unilaterally took power without formal agreement and started to withhold tax revenue and capture Adjara's considerable wealth.{{sfn|George|2009|p=121}}{{sfn|George|2009|p=123}} However, he managed to prevent various paramilitary groups from entering Adjara's territory, and preserved peace through [[authoritarianism]], which brought him considerable popularity.<ref name="wheatley"/>

After the end of Georgia's civil war, Abashidze reached agreement with the Georgian president [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] to stay in power.<ref name="Abash"/> Shevardnadze, who had yet to cement his power in Georgia, ignored Abashidze's authoritarian rule and even appreciated that it brought stability to the region.<ref name="wheatley">{{cite book |last= Wheatley|first=Jonathan|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dGqLAAAAMAAJ|title= Georgia from National Awakening to Rose Revolution |date=2005 |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|isbn= 9780754645030|pages=70–71}}</ref> The central government in Tbilisi had very little say in what went on in Adjara.

However, a series of disputes with UCG in 1997 concerning limits of Abashidze's power in Adjara and defections of his party deputies to UCG led Abashidze to view the UCG and especially its 'reformists' faction with suspicions and he withdrew into opposition, establishing a powerful anti-CUG bloc which took part in the [[1999 Georgian parliamentary election]] and garnered around 25 per cent of the vote.<ref>{{cite book |last= Wheatley|first=Jonathan|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dGqLAAAAMAAJ|title= Georgia from National Awakening to Rose Revolution |date=2005 |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|isbn= 9780754645030|page=124}}</ref>

In 2000, by withdrawing his candidacy from the [[2000 Georgian presidential election|presidential elections in Georgia]], Abashidze managed to get Shevardnadze to change Georgian constitution to increase Adjara's status. From 1997 to 2001, Abashidze passed several amendments to Adjara's constitution to strengthen his power. He established the post of a directly elected Head of the Autonomous Republic of Adjara with powers to control any movement of military on Adjara's territory, and was elected on this position in November 2001 while being the only candidate.<ref>{{cite book |last= Wheatley|first=Jonathan|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dGqLAAAAMAAJ|title= Georgia from National Awakening to Rose Revolution |date=2005 |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|isbn= 9780754645030|page=116}}</ref>

{{unreferenced section|date=October 2024}}
[[File:Gonio, Batumi, Georgia.jpg|thumb|[[Gonio (settlement)|Gonio]], a [[Black Sea]] resort near [[Gonio Fortress]].]]
Adjara is on the southeastern coast of the Black Sea and extends into the wooded foothills and mountains of the [[Caucasus Mountains|Lesser Caucasus]]. It has borders with the region of [[Guria]] to the north, [[Samtskhe-Javakheti]] to the east and Turkey to the south. Most of Adjara's territory either consists of hills or mountains. The highest mountains rise more than {{convert|3,000|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Around 60% of Adjara is covered by forests. Many parts of the [[Meskheti Range]] (the west-facing slopes) are covered by [[temperate rain forests]].

Adjara is traversed by the northeasterly line of equal latitude and longitude.

===Climate===

Adjara is well known for its humid climate (especially along the coastal regions) and prolonged rainy weather, although there is plentiful sunshine during the spring and summer months. Adjara receives the highest amounts of precipitation both in Georgia and in the [[Caucasus]]. It is also one of the wettest temperate regions in the [[northern hemisphere]]. No region along Adjara's coast receives less than {{convert|2200|mm|1|abbr=on}} of precipitation per year. The west-facing ([[windward]]) slopes of the [[Meskheti Range]] receive upwards of {{convert|4500|mm|1|abbr=on}} of precipitation per year. The coastal lowlands receive most of the precipitation in the form of rain (due to the area's subtropical climate). September and October are usually the wettest months. Batumi's average monthly rainfall for the month of September is {{convert|410|mm|2|abbr=on}}. The interior parts of Adjara are considerably drier than the coastal mountains and lowlands. Winter usually brings significant snowfall to the higher regions of Adjara, where snowfall often reaches several meters. Average summer temperatures are between {{convert|22|to|24|°C}} in the lowland areas and {{convert|17|to|21|°C}} in the highlands. The highest areas of Adjara have lower temperatures. Average winter temperatures are between {{convert|4|and|6|°C}} along the coast while the interior areas and mountains average around {{convert|-3|to|2|°C}}. Some of the highest mountains of Adjara have average winter temperatures of {{convert|-8|to|-7|°C}}.

Adjara has good land for growing tea, citrus fruits and tobacco. Mountainous and forested, the region has a subtropical climate, and there are many health resorts. Tobacco, tea, citrus fruits, and avocados are leading crops; livestock raising is also important. Industries include tea packing, tobacco processing, fruit and fish canning, oil refining, and shipbuilding.

The regional capital, [[Batumi]], is an important gateway for the shipment of goods heading into Georgia, [[Azerbaijan]] and landlocked [[Armenia]]. The port of Batumi is used for the shipment of oil from [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Turkmenistan]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Description |url=https://www.batumioilterminal.com/about-company |access-date=2023-12-28 |website=www.batumioilterminal.com}}</ref> Its oil refinery handles [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] oil from Azerbaijan which arrives by pipeline to [[Supsa]] port and is transported from there to Batumi by rail. The Adjaran capital is a centre for shipbuilding and manufacturing.

Adjara is the main center of Georgia's coastal tourism industry, having displaced the northwestern province of [[Abkhazia]] since that region's ''de facto'' secession from Georgia in 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geostat.ge/media/53289/Inbound-Tourism-Statistics-%28I-Quarter%2C-2023-year%29.pdf|title=Inbound Tourism Statistics in Georgia (I-Quarter, 2023-year)|website=geostat.ge|access-date=16 February 2024}}</ref>

After Adjara was ceded to the Russian Empire in 1878 under the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]], those [[Adjarians]] who were Muslim were allowed to leave for Turkey.{{sfn|Hoch|Kopeček|2011|p=7}} While the Russian authorities supported the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]'s missionary efforts, they also tried to win the loyalty of Adjarians by building mosques and madrassas and supporting the local Muslim clergy.{{sfn|Sanikidze|2018|p=250}} As a result, many Adjarians emigrants, called [[Muhacir]], came back to Adjara.{{sfn|Sanikidze|2018|p=250}}
