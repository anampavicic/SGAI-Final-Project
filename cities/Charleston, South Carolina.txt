Charleston was founded in 1670 as Charles Town, honoring [[Charles II of England|King Charles{{nbsp}}II]], at Albemarle Point on the west bank of the Ashley River (now [[Charles Towne Landing]]) but relocated in 1680 to its present site, which became the fifth-largest city in [[North America]] within ten years. It remained [[Municipal corporation|unincorporated]] throughout the colonial period; its government was handled directly by a colonial legislature and a governor sent by [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]]. Election districts were organized according to [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] parishes, and some social services were managed by Anglican [[Churchwarden|wardens]] and [[vestry|vestries]]. Charleston adopted its present spelling with its incorporation as a city in 1783. Population growth in the interior of South Carolina influenced the removal of the state government to [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] in 1788, but Charleston remained among the ten largest cities in the United States through the [[1840 U.S. Census|1840 census]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/population/documentation/twps0027/tab07.txt |title=Population of the 100 Largest Urban Places: 1840 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420110123/http://www.census.gov/population/documentation/twps0027/tab07.txt |archive-date=April 20, 2008 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Charleston's significance in American history is tied to its role as a major slave trading port. Charleston slave traders like [[Joseph Wragg]] were the first to break through the monopoly of the [[Royal African Company]] and pioneered the large-scale slave trade of the 18th century; almost one-half of enslaved people imported to the United States arrived in Charleston.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/arts/charleston-international-african-american-museum.html Michael Kimmelman, "Charleston Needs That African American Museum.

[[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] granted the chartered [[Province of Carolina]] to eight of his loyal friends, known as the [[Lords Proprietors]], on March 24, 1663. In 1670, Governor [[William Sayle]] arranged for several shiploads of settlers from [[Bermuda]] and [[Barbados]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Lewis |first=J.D. |year=2007 |title=Carolina – The Barbadian Settlers, et.al. |url=http://www.carolana.com/Carolina/Settlement/barbadian_settlers.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703194506/http://www.carolana.com/Carolina/Settlement/barbadian_settlers.html |archive-date=July 3, 2007 |access-date=January 6, 2018 |website=www.carolana.com |quote=Charles Town and surrounding areas were first settled by folks from Barbados and Bermuda}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199730414/obo-9780199730414-0293.xml |chapter=Barbados in the Atlantic World |last=Roberts |first=Justin |title=Atlantic History |date=April 26, 2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |doi=10.1093/OBO/9780199730414-0293 |isbn=978-0-19-973041-4 |access-date=January 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501035412/http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199730414/obo-9780199730414-0293.xml |archive-date=May 1, 2018 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> These settlers established what was then called Charles Town at Albemarle Point, on the west bank of the Ashley River, a few miles northwest of the present-day city center.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=944}} Charles Town became the first comprehensively planned town in the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. Its governance, settlement, and development were to follow a visionary plan known as the [[Grand Model for the Province of Carolina|Grand Model]] prepared for the Lord's Proprietors by [[John Locke]].<ref>Wilson, Thomas D. ''The Ashley Cooper Plan: The Founding of Carolina and the Origins of Southern Political Culture''. p. 12.</ref> Because the [[Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina|Carolina's Fundamental Constitutions]] was never ratified, however, Charles Town was never incorporated during the colonial period. Instead, [[local ordinance]]s were passed by the provincial government, with day-to-day administration handled by the [[Churchwarden|wardens]] and [[Vestry|vestries]] of [[St. Philip's Episcopal Church (Charleston, South Carolina)|St{{nbsp}}Philip's]] and [[St. Michael's Episcopal Church (Charleston, South Carolina)|St{{nbsp}}Michael's]] [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] [[List of counties in South Carolina#Parishes|parishes]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=944}}

At the time of [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]], the area was inhabited by the indigenous [[Cusabo]], on whom the settlers declared war in October 1671. The settlers initially allied with the [[Westo]], a northern indigenous tribe that traded in enslaved Indians. The settlers abandoned their alliance with the Westo in 1679 and allied with the Cusabo instead.<ref>{{citation |last=Gallay |first=Alan |date=2002 |title=The Indian Slave Trade: The Rise of the English Empire in the American South 1670–1717 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-10193-7}}</ref>

The initial settlement quickly dwindled and disappeared while another village—established by the settlers on Oyster Point at the confluence of the Ashley and Cooper rivers around 1672{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=944}}—thrived. This second settlement formally replaced the original Charles Town in 1680.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=429}} (The original site is now commemorated as [[Charles Towne Landing]].) The second location was more defensible and had access to a fine natural harbor. The new town had become the fifth largest in North America by 1690.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishritecalifornia.org/charleston_time_line.htm |title=Charleston Time Line |access-date=July 9, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806100339/http://www.scottishritecalifornia.org/charleston_time_line.htm |archive-date=August 6, 2007 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

A [[smallpox]] outbreak erupted in 1698, followed by an earthquake in February 1699. The latter caused a fire that destroyed about a third of the town. During rebuilding,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma97/danforth/thesis/mainframe.html |title=A Charleston Love Story |website=Xroads.virginia.edu |date=October 17, 2000 |access-date=May 30, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124045715/http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma97/danforth/thesis/mainframe.html |archive-date=November 24, 2015 }}</ref> a [[yellow fever]] outbreak killed about 15% of the remaining inhabitants. Charles Town suffered between five and eight significant [[yellow fever]] outbreaks over the first half of the 18th century.

It developed a reputation as one of the least healthy locations in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] for ethnic Europeans. [[Malaria]] was endemic. Although malaria did not have such high mortality as yellow fever, it caused much illness. It was a major health problem throughout most of the city's history before dying out in the 1950s after the use of pesticides cut down on the mosquitoes that transmitted it.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Edgar |editor-first=Walter B. |last=McCandless |first=Peter |date=2006 |location=Columbia |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |url=http://charlestoncurrents.com/2015/03/malaria/ |title=Malaria |access-date=October 9, 2016 |archive-date=January 10, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110033120/http://charlestoncurrents.com/2015/03/malaria/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
[[File:CharlestonSC1733.jpg|thumb|left|[[Herman Moll]]'s 1733 ''Town and Harbour of Charles Town in South Carolina'', showing the town's defensive walls.]]

Charles Town was fortified according to a plan developed in 1704 under [[List of colonial governors of South Carolina|Governor]] [[Nathaniel Johnson (politician)|Nathaniel Johnson]]. Both [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and [[French colonial empire|France]] contested Britain's claims to the region. Various bands of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and independent [[Piracy|pirates]] also raided it.

On September 5–6, 1713 (O.S.), a violent [[hurricane]] passed over Charles Town. The [[Circular Congregational Church]] manse was damaged during the storm, and church records were lost. Much of Charles Town was flooded as "the Ashley and Cooper rivers became one." At least seventy people died in the disaster.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.circularchurch.org/history |title=A Brief History of the Circular Church |website=Circular Congregational Church |access-date=November 14, 2018 |archive-date=September 22, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922233914/http://www.circularchurch.org/history |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.usdeadlyevents.com/1713-sep-16-17-hurricane-charleston-and-vicinity-south-carolina-70/ |title=1713 – Sep 16–17, Hurricane, Charleston and vicinity, South Carolina – 70 – Deadliest American Disasters and Large-Loss-of-Life Events |website=www.usdeadlyevents.com |date=September 1713 |language=en-US |access-date=November 14, 2018 |archive-date=November 14, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181114100519/http://www.usdeadlyevents.com/1713-sep-16-17-hurricane-charleston-and-vicinity-south-carolina-70/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

From the 1670s, Charleston attracted pirates. The combination of a weak government and corruption made the city popular with pirates, who frequently visited and raided the city. Charles Town was besieged by the pirate [[Blackbeard]] for several days in May 1718. Blackbeard released his hostages and left in exchange for a chest of medicine from [[Robert Johnson (governor)|Governor Robert Johnson]].<ref name="D. Moore. 1997 pp. 31">D. Moore. (1997) "A General History of Blackbeard the Pirate, the Queen Anne's Revenge and the Adventure". In ''Tributaries'', Volume VII, 1997. pp. 31–35. (North Carolina Maritime History Council)</ref>

Around 1719, the town's name began to be generally written as Charlestown{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=944}} and, excepting those fronting the Cooper River, the old walls were largely removed over the next decade. Charlestown was a center for the inland colonization of [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]]. It remained the southernmost point of the [[Southern Colonies]] until the [[Province of Georgia]] was established in 1732. As noted, the first settlers primarily came from [[Europe]], [[Barbados]] and [[Bermuda]]. The Barbadian and Bermudan immigrants were planters who brought enslaved Africans with them, having purchased them in the [[West Indies]].

Early immigrant groups to the city included the [[Huguenot]]s, [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[Irish people|Irish]], and [[Germans]], as well as [[History of the Jews in Charleston, South Carolina|hundreds of Jews]], predominately [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] from [[London]] and significant cities of the [[Dutch Republic]], where they had been given refuge.<ref name=ed61>{{harvp|Edgar|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=EFSbwGk2szgC&pg=PA61 61]}}</ref> As late as 1830, Charleston's Jewish community was the most prominent and wealthiest [[Judaism in the United States|in North America]].<ref name=ed61/><ref>{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/0103137.html |contribution=A 'Portion of the People' |url=http://www.harvardmagazine.com |title=Harvard Magazine |publisher=Harvard University |access-date=August 1, 2006 |archive-date=January 15, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070115130446/http://www.harvardmagazine.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

By 1708, most of the colony's population were [[Black people|Black]] Africans. They had been brought to Charlestown via the [[Atlantic slave trade]], first as [[Indentured servitude|indentured servants]] and then as [[Slavery in the colonial United States| enslaved people]]. In the early 1700s, Charleston's largest slave trader, [[Joseph Wragg]], pioneered the settlement's involvement in the slave trade. Of the estimated 400,000 captive Africans transported to North America to be sold into slavery, 40% are thought to have landed at [[Sullivan's Island]] off Charlestown. [[Free people of color]] also migrated from the [[West Indies]], being descendants of white planters and their Black consorts and unions among the working classes.<ref name="johnson">{{cite book |author1=Michael P.

In 1767, Gadsden's Wharf was constructed at the city port on the Cooper River; it ultimately extended 840 feet and could accommodate six ships at a time. Many enslaved people were sold from here.<ref name="iaam">[https://iaamuseum.org/history/gadsdens-wharf/ History: Gadsden's Wharf] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722145328/https://iaamuseum.org/history/gadsdens-wharf/ |date=July 22, 2017 }}, International African American Museum; accessed March 29, 2018</ref> Devoted to plantation agriculture that depended on enslaved labor, South Carolina became a slave society: it had a majority-Black population from the colonial period until after the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of the early 20th century, when many rural Blacks moved to northern and midwestern industrial cities to escape [[Jim Crow laws]].
[[File:Rainbow Row front.jpg|thumb|[[Rainbow Row]]'s 13 houses along East Bay Street formed the commercial center of the town in the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial period]].]]

At the foundation of the town, the principal items of commerce were [[longleaf pine|pine]] [[timber]] and [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] for [[Sailing ship|ships]] and [[Tobacco in the United States|tobacco]]. The early economy developed around the [[deerskin]] trade, in which colonists used alliances with the [[Cherokee]] and [[Muscogee|Creek]] peoples to secure the raw material.

At the same time, Native Americans kidnapped and enslaved each other in warfare. From 1680 to 1720, approximately 40,000 native men, women, and children were sold through the port, principally to the [[West Indies]] such as ([[Bermuda]] and [[the Bahamas]]), but also to other Southern colonies.<ref name=jpd>{{citation |contribution-url=http://ldhi.library.cofc.edu/exhibits/show/james_poyas_daybook_eighteenth/historical-context-settlement- |title=The James Poyas Daybook: An Account of a Charles Town Merchant, 1760–1765 |publisher=Lowcountry Digital History Initiative |url=http://ldhi.library.cofc.edu/exhibits/show/james_poyas_daybook_eighteenth/introduction |contribution=Settlement, Trade, and Conflicts in Colonial South Carolina |access-date=October 7, 2016 |archive-date=October 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009150920/http://ldhi.library.cofc.edu/exhibits/show/james_poyas_daybook_eighteenth/introduction |url-status=live }}</ref> The Lowcountry planters did not keep enslaved Native Americans, considering them too prone to escape or revolt.

The area's unsuitability for growing [[Tobacco in the United States|tobacco]] prompted the [[Lowcountry]] [[Planter class|planters]] to experiment with other [[cash crop]]s.

The planters attributed the violence to recently imported Africans and agreed to a 10-year moratorium on slave importation through Charlestown. They relied for labor upon the slave communities they already held. The [[Negro Act of 1740|1740 Negro Act]] also tightened controls, requiring a ratio of one white for every ten Blacks on any plantation (which was often not achieved) and banning enslaved people from assembling, growing personal food, earning money, or learning to read. [[African drum|Drums]] were banned because Africans used them for signaling; enslaved people were allowed to use string and other instruments.{{sfnp|Diouf|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2VGoAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA273 273]}} When the moratorium expired and Charlestown reopened to the slave trade in 1750, the memory of the Stono Rebellion resulted in traders avoiding buying enslaved people from the [[Kingdom of Congo|Congo]] and [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], whose populations had a reputation for independence.

By the mid-18th century, Charlestown was the hub of the Atlantic slave trade in the [[Southern Colonies]]. Even with the decade-long moratorium, its customs processed around 40% of the enslaved Africans brought to North America between 1700 and 1775,<ref name=ed67>{{harvp|Edgar|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=EFSbwGk2szgC&pg=PA67 67]}}</ref> and about half up until the end of the African trade.

===American Revolution (1776–1783)===
{{Further|American Revolution|American Revolutionary War}}
[[File:CharlestownSC1780.jpg|thumb|left|Charlestown and environs in 1780]]
Delegates for the [[Continental Congress]] were elected in 1774, and South Carolina declared its independence from Britain on the steps of the [[Exchange and Provost|Exchange]]. Slavery was again an important factor in the city's role during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. The British attacked the settlement three times,{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=429}} assuming that the settlement had a large base of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] who would rally to their cause once given some military support.<ref>{{citation |title=Fusiliers |first=Mark |last=Urban}}</ref> The loyalty of white Southerners towards [[the Crown]] had largely been forfeited, however, by British legal cases (such as the 1772 [[Somerset v Stewart|Somersett case]] which marked the prohibition of slavery in [[England and Wales]], a significant milestone in the [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] struggle) and military tactics (such as [[Dunmore's Proclamation]] in 1775) that promised the emancipation of people enslaved by Patriot planters; these efforts did, however, unsurprisingly win the allegiance of thousands of [[Black Loyalist]]s.

The [[Battle of Sullivan's Island]] saw the British fail to capture a partially constructed [[Fort Moultrie|palmetto palisade]] from [[William Moultrie|Col. Moultrie]]'s [[2nd South Carolina Regiment|militia regiment]] on June 28, 1776. The [[Liberty Flag]] used by Moultrie's men formed the basis of the later [[South Carolina flag]], and the victory's anniversary continues to be commemorated as [[Carolina Day]].

Making the capture of Charlestown their chief priority, the British sent [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Sir Henry Clinton]], who laid [[Siege of Charleston|siege to Charleston]] on April 1, 1780, with about 14,000 troops and 90 ships.{{sfnp|McCandless|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NMrqxrLAHUgC&pg=PA89 89]}} Bombardment began on March 11, 1780. The Patriots, led by [[Benjamin Lincoln]], had about 5,500 men and inadequate fortifications to repel the forces against them. After the British cut his supply lines and lines of retreat at the battles of [[Battle of Monck's Corner|Monck's Corner]] and [[Battle of Lenud's Ferry|Lenud's Ferry]], Lincoln's surrender on May 12, 1780, became the greatest [[List of American Revolutionary War battles|American defeat of the war]].

The British continued to hold Charlestown for over a year following [[Siege of Yorktown (1781)|their defeat at Yorktown]] in 1781. However, they alienated local planters by refusing to restore full civil government. [[Nathanael Greene]] had entered the state after Cornwallis's [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse|pyrrhic victory]] at [[Guilford Courthouse]] and kept the area under a kind of siege. [[British Army]] officer [[Alexander Leslie (British Army officer)|Alexander Leslie]], commanding Charlestown, requested a truce in March 1782 to purchase food for his garrison and the town's inhabitants. Greene refused and formed a brigade under [[Mordecai Gist]] to counter British forays. The British finally evacuated Charlestown in December 1782. Greene presented the British leaders of the town with the [[Moultrie Flag]].

Between the Revolutionary War and the Civil War, Charleston experienced an economic boom, at least for the top strata of society. Expanding cotton as a cash crop in the South led to massive wealth for a small segment of society and funded impressive architecture and culture. However, it also escalated the economic importance of enslaving people and led to greater and greater restrictions on Black Charlestonians.

By 1783, the city's growth had reached a point where a municipal government became desirable; therefore, on August 13, 1783, an act of incorporation for Charleston was ratified. The act originally specified the city's name as "Charles Ton," as opposed to the previous Charlestown, but the spelling "Charleston" quickly came to dominate.<ref>{{Cite podcast|last=Butler |first=Nic |date=August 9, 2019 |title=The Evolution of Charleston's Name |url=https://www.ccpl.org/charleston-time-machine/evolution-charlestons-name |access-date=July 11, 2022 |website=Charleston Time Machine |publisher=Charleston County Public Library}}</ref>

Although [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] had replaced it as the state capital in 1788, Charleston became even more prosperous as [[Eli Whitney]]'s 1793 invention of the [[cotton gin]] sped the processing of the crop over 50 times. [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]'s [[Industrial Revolution#Textile manufacture|Industrial Revolution]]—initially built upon its [[Textile industry#Industrial revolution|textile industry]]—took up the extra production ravenously and cotton became Charleston's major export commodity in the 19th century.

The Bank of South Carolina, the second-oldest building in the nation to be constructed as a bank, was established in 1798. In 1800 and 1817, branches of the [[First Bank of the United States|First]] and [[Second Bank of the United States|Second]] banks were also located in Charleston.

Throughout the [[Antebellum South|Antebellum Period]], Charleston continued to be the only major American city with a majority-slave population.<ref name=macky28/>{{efn|[[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Antebellum Georgia|Georgia]], and [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Antebellum Virginia|Virginia]], came closest, reaching 40% at times.<ref name=macky28>{{harvp|McInnis|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=a8g3CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA28 28]}}</ref>}} The city's widespread use of enslaved people as workers was a frequent subject of writers and visitors: a merchant from Liverpool noted in 1834 that "almost all the working population are Negroes, all the servants, the carmen & porters, all the people who see at the stalls in Market, and most of the Journeymen in trades".<ref name=macky48>{{harvp|Thompson|2015|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Cs27BwAAQBAJ&pg=PP48 48]}}</ref> American traders had been [[Slave Trade Act of 1794|prohibited from equipping]] the [[Atlantic slave trade]] in 1794 and all importation of enslaved people was banned [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|in 1808]], but American merchantmen frequently refused to permit [[Blockade of Africa|British inspection]] for enslaved cargo, and smuggling remained common. Much more important was the domestic slave trade, which boomed as the Deep South developed into new cotton plantations. As a result of the trade, there was a forced migration of more than one million enslaved people from the Upper South to the Lower South in the antebellum years. During the early 19th century, the first dedicated slave markets were founded in Charleston, mostly near Chalmers and State streets.<ref name=ed67/> Many domestic slavers used Charleston as a port in the coastwise trade, traveling to such ports as Mobile and New Orleans.

Enslaving was the primary marker of class, and even the town's freedmen and [[free people of color]] typically enslaved people if they had the wealth to do so.<ref>Kroger, Larry Black. ''Slaveowners: Free Black Slave Masters in South Carolina, 1790–1860''.

The effects of slavery were pronounced on white society as well. The high cost of enslaving people in the 19th century and their high rate of return combined to institute an oligarchic society controlled by about ninety interrelated families, where 4% of the free population controlled half of the wealth, and the lower half of the free population—unable to compete with enslaved or rented people—held no wealth at all.<ref name=macky28/> The white middle class was minimal: Charlestonians generally looked down upon hard work, considering it as labor meant for enslaved people.<ref name=macky29>{{harvp|McInnis|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=a8g3CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA29 29]}}</ref> All the enslavers taken together held 82% of the city's wealth and almost all non-enslavers were poor.<ref name=macky28/> [[Frederick Law Olmsted|Olmsted]] considered their civic elections "entirely contests of money and personal influence" and the oligarchs dominated civic planning:{{refn|[[Frederick Law Olmsted|Olmsted]],<ref>{{citation |last=Olmsted |first=Frederick Law |title=mcJourney in the Seaboard Slave States}}</ref> cited in McInnis.<ref name=macky28/>}} The lack of public parks and amenities was noted, as was the abundance of private gardens in the wealthy's walled estates.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=428}}

Soon, U.S. soldiers were dispensed to Charleston's forts, and five [[United States Coast Guard cutter]]s were detached to Charleston Harbor "to take possession of any vessel arriving from a foreign port, and defend her against any attempt to dispossess the Customs Officers of her custody until all the requirements of law have been complied with." This federal action became known as the Charleston incident. The state's politicians worked on a compromise law in Washington to gradually reduce the tariffs.<ref>{{cite book |last=Willoughby |first=Malcolm F. |title=The U.S. Coast Guard in World War II |url=https://archive.org/details/uscoastguardinw00will |url-access=registration |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute]] |date=1957 |location=[[Annapolis, Maryland]] |page=[https://archive.org/details/uscoastguardinw00will/page/4 4]}}</ref>

Charleston's embrace of classical architecture began after a devastating fire leveled much of the city. On April 27, 1838, Charleston suffered a catastrophic fire that burned more than 1000 buildings and caused about $3 million ({{Inflation|index=US-GDP|value=3000000|start_year=1838|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) in damage at the time. The damaged buildings amounted to about one-fourth of all the businesses in the main part of the city. A great cultural awakening occurred when many homes and businesses were rebuilt or repaired. Before the fire, few homes were styled as Greek Revival; many residents decided to construct new buildings in that style after the conflagration. This tradition continued, making Charleston one of the foremost places to view [[Greek Revival]] architecture. The [[Gothic Revival]] also made a significant appearance in the construction of many churches after the fire that exhibited picturesque forms and reminders of devout European religion.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://historyengine.richmond.edu/episodes/view/3531 |title=History Engine: Tools for Collaborative Education and Research &#124; Episodes |website=Historyengine.richmond.edu |access-date=May 30, 2017 |archive-date=May 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508144325/https://historyengine.richmond.edu/episodes/view/3531 |url-status=live }}</ref>

By 1840, the Market Hall and Sheds, where fresh meat and produce were brought daily, became a hub of commercial activity. The [[History of slavery|slave trade]] also depended on the port of Charleston, where ships could be unloaded and enslaved people bought and sold. The legal importation of enslaved Africans had ended in 1808, although smuggling was significant. However, the domestic trade was booming. More than one million enslaved people were transported from the [[Upland South|Upper South]] to the [[Deep South]] in the antebellum years, as cotton plantations were widely developed through what became known as the [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]]. Many enslaved people were transported in the [[coastwise slave trade]], with slave ships stopping at ports such as Charleston.

Charleston was significant in the [[American Civil War]]. As a pivotal city, the U.S. Army and Confederate States Army vied for control of it. The rebellion began in [[Charleston Harbor]] in 1861 and ended mere months after the U.S. soldiers retook control of Charleston in 1865.

Following [[1860 US presidential election|the election]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]], the [[South Carolina General Assembly]] voted on December 20, 1860, to declare [[secession]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|United States]], becoming the first state to do so. On December 27, the U.S. Army garrison of [[Castle Pinckney]] surrendered to the state militia. On January 9, 1861, [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|Citadel]] cadets opened fire on the USS{{nbsp}}''[[Star of the West]]'' as it entered Charleston Harbor.

The first full battle of the war occurred on April 12, 1861, when shore batteries under the command of General [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] fired upon the {{nowrap|[[US Army]]-}}held [[Fort Sumter]] in Charleston Harbor.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=429}} After a 34-hour bombardment, [[Major Robert Anderson]] surrendered the fort.

On December 11, 1861, an enormous fire burned over {{cvt|500|acre|sp=us}} of the city.

U.S. Navy control of the North Atlantic coastline permitted the repeated bombardment of the city, causing vast damage.<ref name=symonds/> Although Admiral Du Pont's naval assault on the town's forts in April 1863 failed,{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=429}} the U.S. Navy's blockade shut down most commercial traffic. Throughout the war, some [[Blockade runners of the American Civil War|blockade runners]] got through, but not a single one made it into or out of Charleston Harbor between August 1863 and March 1864.<ref name=symonds>Craig L.

General Gillmore's land assault in July 1864 was unsuccessful{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=429}} but the fall of [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] and advance of General [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T. Sherman]]'s army through the state prompted the Confederates to evacuate the town on February 17, 1865, burning the public buildings, cotton warehouses, and other sources of supply before their departure.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=429}} [[Union Army|U.S. soldiers]] liberated the city within the month.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=429}} The War Department recovered what federal property remained. Also, it confiscated the campus of the [[Citadel Military Academy]] and used it as a U.S. Army garrison for the next 17 years. The facilities were finally returned to the state and reopened as a military college in 1882 under the direction of Lawrence E. Marichak.

===Postbellum (1865–1945)===
====Reconstruction====
After the defeat of the Confederacy, U.S. soldiers remained in Charleston during the [[Reconstruction era]]. The war had shattered the city's prosperity. Still, the African-American population surged (from 17,000 in 1860 to over 27,000 in 1880) as freedmen moved from the countryside to the major city.<ref name="strickland">{{Cite web|url=http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4870&context=etd|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028004634/http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4870&context=etd|url-status=dead|title=Jeffrey G.

At the onset of the war, the city had 3,785 free people of color, many of mixed race, making up about 18% of the city's black population and 8% of its total population. Many were educated and practiced skilled crafts;<ref name="johnson"/> they quickly became leaders of South Carolina's [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and its legislators.

By the late 1870s, industry was bringing the city and its inhabitants back to a renewed vitality; new jobs attracted new residents.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=429}} As the city's commerce improved, residents worked to restore or create community institutions. In 1865, the [[College of Charleston|Avery Normal Institute]] was established by the [[American Missionary Association]] as the first free secondary school for Charleston's African American population. Gen. Sherman lent his support to the conversion of the United States Arsenal into the Porter Military Academy, an educational facility for former soldiers and boys left orphaned or destitute by the war. Porter Military Academy later joined with Gaud School and is now a [[university-preparatory school]], [[Porter-Gaud School]].

In 1875, blacks made up 57% of the city's and 73% of the county's population.<ref name="meeks"/> With leadership by members of the antebellum free black community, historian Melinda Meeks Hennessy described the community as "unique" in being able to defend themselves without provoking "massive white retaliation", as occurred in numerous other areas during [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].<ref name="meeks">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/27567894 Melinda Meeks Hennessy, "Racial Violence During Reconstruction: The 1876 Riots in Charleston and Cainhoy"], ''South Carolina Historical Magazine'', Vol. 86, No. 2, (April 1985), 104–106 {{subscription required|via JSTOR}} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180928082928/https://www.jstor.org/stable/27567894 |date=September 28, 2018 }}</ref> In the 1876 election cycle, two major riots between black Republicans and white Democrats occurred in the city, in September and the day after the election in November, as well as a violent incident in Cainhoy at an October joint discussion meeting.<ref name="meeks"/>

Violent incidents occurred throughout the Piedmont of the state as white insurgents struggled to impose [[white supremacy]] in the face of social changes after the war and the granting of citizenship to freedmen by amendments to the U.S. Constitution. After former Confederates were allowed to vote again, election campaigns from 1872 on were marked by violent intimidation of blacks and Republicans by conservative Democratic [[paramilitary]] groups, known as the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]]. Violent incidents occurred in Charleston on King Street on September 6 and nearby Cainhoy on October 15 in association with political meetings before the 1876 election. The Cainhoy incident was the only one statewide in which more whites were killed than blacks.<ref name="foley">[http://www.screconstruction.org/Reconstruction/Sites_of_violence/Entries/1876/10/16_Cainhoy_Riot.html Reconstruction as Armed Insurgency: Cainhoy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106211013/http://www.screconstruction.org/Reconstruction/Sites_of_violence/Entries/1876/10/16_Cainhoy_Riot.html |date=November 6, 2014 }}, ''South Carolina during Reconstruction'', 2010–2012, accessed October 27, 2014</ref> The Red Shirts were instrumental in suppressing the black Republican vote in some areas in 1876 and narrowly electing [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]] as governor, and taking back control of the state legislature. Another riot occurred in Charleston the day after the election when a prominent Republican leader was mistakenly reported killed.<ref name="meeks"/>

====Politics====
In the early 20th century, strong political machines emerged in the city, reflecting economic, class, racial, and ethnic tensions. The factions nearly all opposed U.S. Senator [[Benjamin Tillman|Ben Tillman]] who repeatedly attacked and ridiculed the city in the name of upstate poor farmers. Well-organized factions within the Democratic Party in Charleston gave the voters clear choices and played a large role in state politics.<ref>Doyle W. Boggs, "Charleston Politics, 1900–1930: An Overview," ''Proceedings of the South Carolina Historical Association'' 49 (1979) 1–13.</ref>

====1886 earthquake====
{{main|1886 Charleston earthquake}}
On August 31, 1886, Charleston experienced a strong [[1886 Charleston earthquake|earthquake]]. The shock was estimated to have a [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 7.0 and a maximum [[Mercalli intensity scale|Mercalli intensity]] of X (''Extreme''). It was felt as far away as [[Boston]] to the north, [[Chicago]] and [[Milwaukee]] to the northwest, as far west as [[New Orleans]], as far south as [[Cuba]], and as far east as [[Bermuda]]. It damaged 2,000 buildings in Charleston and caused $6 million worth of damage (${{Inflation|US-CAP|6|1886}} million in {{Inflation-year|US-CAP}} dollars), at a time when all the city's buildings were valued around $24 million (${{Inflation|US-CAP|24|1886}} million in {{Inflation-year|US-CAP}} dollars).

====Charleston race riots====
{{main|Charleston riot of 1919}}
The Charleston race riot of 1919 took place on the night of Saturday, May 10, between members of the US Navy and the local black population. They attacked black individuals, businesses, and homes, killing six and injuring dozens.

Charleston languished economically for several decades in the 20th century, though the large federal military presence in the region helped to shore up the city's economy. Charleston's tourism boom began in earnest following the publication of [[Albert Simons]] and [[Samuel Lapham VI|Samuel Lapham]]'s ''Architecture of Charleston''<ref>{{citation |last1=Simons |first1=Albert |last2=Lapham |first2=Samuel VI |ref={{harvid|Simons & al.|1927}} |publisher=Press of the American Institute of Architects |title=Charleston, S.C. |series=The Octagon ''Library of Early American Architecture'', Vol. I |date=1927}}.</ref> in the 1920s.<ref>{{citation |last=Horton |first=Tom |title=History's Lost Moments, ''Vol. V'' |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=thPUBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA182 182] |date=2014 |publisher=Trafford |contribution=Touring Charleston Back in 1912}}</ref>

The [[1969 Charleston hospital strike|Charleston Hospital Strike]] of 1969, in which mostly black workers protested discrimination and low wages, was one of the last major events of the [[civil rights movement]]. It attracted [[Ralph Abernathy]], [[Coretta Scott King]], [[Andrew Young]], and other prominent figures to march with the local leader, Mary Moultrie.

[[Joseph P. Riley Jr.]] was elected mayor in the 1970s and helped advance several cultural aspects of the city.

Between 1989 and 1996, Charleston saw two significant economic hits. First, the eye of Hurricane Hugo came ashore at Charleston Harbor in 1989, and though the worst damage was in nearby [[McClellanville, South Carolina|McClellanville]], three-quarters of the homes in Charleston's historic district sustained damage of varying degrees. The hurricane caused over $2.8 billion in damage. The city rebounded fairly quickly after the hurricane and has grown in population, reaching an estimated 124,593 residents in 2009.<ref name="charlestoncity.info">{{cite web |url=http://www.charlestoncity.info/shared/docs/0/2010_population_estimates.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721192558/http://www.charlestoncity.info/shared/docs/0/2010_population_estimates.pdf |archive-date=July 21, 2011 |title=Century V City of Charleston Population 2010 Estimates}}</ref> Second, in 1993, the [[Base Realignment and Closure Commission]] (BRAC) directed that [[Charleston Naval Shipyard|Naval Base Charleston]] be closed.

After having been a majority-minority city for most of its history, in the late 20th century, many whites began returning to the urban core of Charleston, and the area gentrified with rising prices and rents. From 1980 to 2010, the peninsula's population shifted from two-thirds black to two-thirds white; in 2010, residents numbered 20,668 whites and 10,455 blacks.<ref name="slade">[http://www.postandcourier.com/news/racial-shift-charleston-peninsula-s-makeup-reverses-in-years-with/article_69581977-ef00-5f6c-b969-edb7104344bb.html David Slade, "RACIAL SHIFT: Charleston peninsula's makeup reverses in 30 years, with blacks leaving for suburbs, area becoming two-thirds white"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516163040/http://www.postandcourier.com/news/racial-shift-charleston-peninsula-s-makeup-reverses-in-years-with/article_69581977-ef00-5f6c-b969-edb7104344bb.html |date=May 16, 2017 }}, ''The Post and Courier'', March 28, 2011; accessed November 10, 2016</ref> Many African Americans moved to the less-expensive suburbs in these decades.<ref name="slade"/>

The city limits also have expanded across the Cooper River, encompassing [[Daniel Island]] and the [[Cainhoy]] area. The present city has a total area of {{convert|135.51|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|115.03|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|20.48|sqmi}} (15.11%) is water.<ref name="TigerWebMapServer"/> [[North Charleston]] blocks any expansion up the peninsula, and [[Mt Pleasant, South Carolina|Mount Pleasant]] occupies the land directly east of the Cooper River.

[[Charleston Harbor]] runs about {{cvt|7|miles|sp=us|0}} southeast to the Atlantic with an average width of about {{cvt|2|miles|sp=us}}, surrounded on all sides except its entrance. [[Sullivan's Island, South Carolina|Sullivan's Island]] lies to the north of the entrance and [[Morris Island]] to the south. The entrance itself is about {{cvt|1|mi|sp=us|0}} wide; it was originally only {{cvt|18|ft|sp=us|0}} deep but began to be enlarged in the 1870s.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=428}} The tidal rivers ([[Wando River|Wando]], Cooper, [[Stono River|Stono]], and Ashley) are evidence of a [[Submergent coastline|submergent]] or drowned coastline. There is a submerged river delta off the mouth of the harbor, and the Cooper River is deep.

===Climate===
[[File:Building wrecked by Hugo.jpg|left|thumb|Damage left from [[Hurricane Hugo]] in 1989]]
Charleston has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''), with mild winters, hot humid summers, and significant rainfall all year long. Summer is the wettest season; almost half of the annual rainfall occurs from June to September in the form of [[thundershower]]s. Fall remains relatively warm through the middle of November. Winter is short and mild and is characterized by occasional rain. Measurable snow (≥{{cvt|0.1|in|cm|disp=or}}) has a median occurrence of only once per decade at the airport, but freezing rain is more common; a snowfall/freezing rain event on January 3, 2018, was the first such event in Charleston since December 26, 2010.<ref name="NWS Charleston, SC (CHS)" /> However, {{cvt|6.0|in|cm}} fell at the airport on December 23, 1989, during the [[December 1989 United States cold wave]], the largest single-day fall on record, contributing to a single-storm and seasonal record of {{cvt|8.0|in|cm}} snowfall.<ref name="NWS Charleston, SC (CHS)" />

[[Downtown Charleston, South Carolina|Downtown Charleston]]'s climate is milder than the airport's due to more substantial maritime influence. This is especially true in the winter, with the average January low in downtown being {{cvt|43.6|°F|0}} to the airport's {{cvt|38.9|°F|0}} for example.

The highest temperature recorded within city limits was {{cvt|104|°F|0}} on June 2, 1985, and June 24, 1944; the lowest was {{cvt|7|°F|0}} on [[Great Blizzard of 1899|February 14, 1899]]. At the airport, where official records are kept, the historical range is {{cvt|105|°F|0}} on August 1, 1999, down to {{cvt|6|°F|0}} on [[January 1985 Arctic outbreak|January 21, 1985]].<ref name="NWS Charleston, SC (CHS)" /> Hurricanes are a major threat to the area during the summer and early fall, with several severe hurricanes hitting the area—most notably [[Hurricane Hugo]] on September 21, 1989 (a [[Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale|category 4]] storm). The dewpoint from June to August ranges from {{cvt|19.9|to|21.9|°C|1|order=flip}}.<ref name="WMO 1961–90 KCHS" />

===Metropolitan statistical area===
As defined by the [[Office of Management and Budget]], for use by the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] and other U.S. Government agencies for statistical purposes only, Charleston is included within the [[Charleston metropolitan area, South Carolina|Charleston-North Charleston, SC Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which consists of three counties: [[Charleston County, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[Berkeley County, South Carolina|Berkeley]], and [[Dorchester County, South Carolina|Dorchester]]. The metropolitan statistical area had an estimated population of 849,417 in 2023.<ref name="PopEstCBSA"/> [[North Charleston, South Carolina|North Charleston]] is the second-largest city in the metro area and ranks as the third-largest city in the state; [[Mount Pleasant, South Carolina|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Summerville, South Carolina|Summerville]] are the next-largest cities.

The traditional parish system persisted until counties were established during the [[Reconstruction Era]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-06-04 |title=Parishes, Districts, and Counties in Early South Carolina |url=https://www.ccpl.org/charleston-time-machine/parishes-districts-and-counties-early-south-carolina |access-date=2022-11-06 |website=Charleston County Public Library |language=en}}</ref> Nevertheless, traditional parishes still exist in various capacities, mainly as public service districts. When the city of Charleston was formed, it was defined by the limits of the Parish of St. Philip and St. Michael, which now also includes parts of St. James' Parish, St. George's Parish, St. Andrew's Parish, and St. John's Parish. However, the last two are mostly still incorporated rural parishes.

As of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], there were 150,227 people, 58,902 households, and 31,780 families residing in the city.

In 2023, of the 150,227 people in Charleston, about 134,996 of them lived in Charleston County, and 15,231 of them lived in Berkeley County.<ref name=SCHighwayMapBerkeleyCo>{{cite web|url=https://info2.scdot.org/GISMapping/GISMapdl/Berkeley_County.pdf|title=General Highway System Berkeley County South Carolina|publisher=[[South Carolina Department of Transportation]]|date=April 2023|access-date=2024-10-25}}</ref>

===Language===
Given Charleston's high concentration of African Americans who spoke the [[Gullah language]], a [[creole language]] that developed on the Sea Islands and in the Low Country, the local speech patterns were also influenced by this community. Today, Gullah is still spoken by many African American residents.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gullah {{!}} language {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Gullah-language |access-date=2022-11-06 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> However, rapid development since 1980, especially on the surrounding Sea Islands, has attracted residents from outside the area and led to a decline in Gullah's prominence.

The traditional educated Charleston accent has long been noted throughout the state and South. It is typically heard in wealthy European American older people who trace their families back generations in the city. It has ingliding or monophthongal long mid-vowels, raises ''ay'' and ''aw'' in certain environments, and is [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|nonrhotic]]. [[Sylvester Primer]] of the [[College of Charleston]] wrote about aspects of the local dialect in his late 19th-century works: "Charleston Provincialisms" (1887)<ref name="primer">[https://archive.org/details/jstor-456019 "Charleston Provincialisms" (1887)], Pub. Modern Language Association of America, Vol. iii, Internet Archive and Early Journal Content on JSTOR, accessed November 5, 2014</ref> and "The Huguenot Element in Charleston's Provincialisms", published in a German journal. He believed the accent was based on English, as the earliest settlers spoke it; therefore, it was derived from Elizabethan England and preserved with modifications by Charleston speakers. The disappearing "Charleston accent" spoken mainly by older natives is still noted in the local pronunciation of the city's name. Many Charleston natives ignore the 'r' and elongate the first vowel, pronouncing the name as "Chalston".

===Religion===
Charleston is known as "The Holy City".<ref name=why /> Despite beliefs that the term dates to the city's earliest days and refers to its religiously tolerant culture, the term was coined in the 20th century, likely as a mockery of Charlestonians' self-satisfied attitude about their city.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gilbreth |first1=Edward M. |title=Research says 'Holy City' term not church-based |work=Post and Courier |date=May 25, 2016 |location=Charleston, South Carolina}}</ref> Regardless of the nickname's origination, residents have embraced the term and explained it in more flattering terms.

==Culture==
Charleston's culture blends traditional Southern U.S., English, French, and West African elements. The downtown peninsula has several arts, music, local cuisine, and fashion venues. [[Spoleto Festival USA]], held annually in late spring, was founded in 1977 by [[Pulitzer Prize]]–winning composer [[Gian Carlo Menotti]], who sought to establish a counterpart to the ''Festival dei Due Mondi'' (the Festival of Two Worlds) in [[Spoleto]], [[Italy]].

Charleston's oldest community theater group, the Footlight Players, has provided theatrical productions since 1931.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Footlight Players |url=https://www.footlightplayers.net/ |access-date=2022-11-06 |website=Footlight Players |language=en-US}}</ref> A variety of performing arts venues includes the historic [[Dock Street Theatre]].

Rice is a staple in many dishes, reflecting the rice culture of the Low Country. The cuisine in Charleston is also strongly influenced by British and French elements.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Levine |first=Irene S. |date=2021-12-16 |title=The Cuisine of Charleston: A Unique Mix of History And Geography |url=https://www.moretimetotravel.com/the-cuisine-of-charleston-a-unique-mix-of-history-and-geography/ |access-date=2022-11-06 |website=More Time to Travel |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Music===
{{main|Music in Charleston}}

The [[Gullah]] community has had a tremendous influence on music in Charleston, especially when it comes to the early development of [[jazz]] music. In turn, Charleston's music has influenced the rest of the country. The [[geechee]] dances that accompanied the music of the dock workers in Charleston followed a rhythm that inspired [[Eubie Blake]]'s "Charleston Rag" and later [[James P. Johnson]]'s "[[Charleston (1923 song)|Charleston]]", as well as the [[Charleston (dance)|dance craze]] that defined a nation in the 1920s. "[[Ballin' the Jack]]", which was a popular dance in the years before "Charleston", was written by native Charlestonian [[Chris Smith (composer)|Chris Smith]].<ref>{{cite book |last=McCray |first=Jack |title=Charleston Jazz |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5hsWQcCvUTkC&pg=PA25 |date=June 6, 2007 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |isbn=978-0-7385-4350-5 |pages=11, 12 |access-date=October 16, 2015 |archive-date=January 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116202512/https://books.google.com/books?id=5hsWQcCvUTkC&pg=PA25 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Jenkins Orphanage]] was established in 1891 by the Rev. Daniel J. Jenkins in Charleston. The orphanage accepted donations of musical instruments, and Rev. Jenkins hired local Charleston musicians and Avery Institute Graduates to tutor the boys in music. As a result, Charleston musicians became proficient on various instruments and could read music expertly.<ref>{{cite book |last=McCray |first=Jack |title=Charleston Jazz |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5hsWQcCvUTkC&pg=PA25 |date=June 6, 2007 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |isbn=978-0-7385-4350-5 |page=27 |access-date=October 16, 2015 |archive-date=January 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116202512/https://books.google.com/books?id=5hsWQcCvUTkC&pg=PA25 |url-status=live }}</ref> These traits set Jenkins musicians apart and helped land some of them positions in big bands with Duke Ellington and Count Basie. [[Cat Anderson|William "Cat" Anderson]], [[Jabbo Smith]], and [[Freddie Green]] are but a few of the alumni who became professional musicians. Orphanages around the country began to develop brass bands in the wake of the Jenkins Orphanage Band's success.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jenkins Orphanage Band - Charleston, South Carolina |url=https://www.sciway.net/south-carolina/jenkins-orphanage.html |access-date=2022-11-06 |website=www.sciway.net}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Our History |url=https://jenkinsinstitute.org/index.php/our-history |access-date=2022-11-06 |website=jenkinsinstitute.org |archive-date=November 6, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221106192650/https://jenkinsinstitute.org/index.php/our-history |url-status=dead }}</ref>

As many as five bands were on tour during the 1920s. The Jenkins Orphanage Band played in the inaugural parades of Presidents [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[William Howard Taft|William Taft]] and toured the US and Europe.<ref>Edgar, Walter. ''South Carolina Encyclopedia'' (2006) pp. 590–591, {{ISBN|1-57003-598-9}}</ref> The band also played on Broadway for the play "Porgy" by [[DuBose Heyward|DuBose]] and [[Dorothy Heyward]], a stage version of their novel of the same title. The story was based in Charleston and featured the Gullah community. The Heywards insisted on hiring the genuine Jenkins Orphanage Band to portray themselves on stage.<ref name="Hubbert">{{cite web |last=Hubbert |first=Julie |title=Jenkins Orphanage |url=http://www.sc.edu/orphanfilm/orphanage/symposia/scholarship/hubbert/jenkins-orphanage.html/ |access-date=February 18, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929081937/http://www.sc.edu/orphanfilm/orphanage/symposia/scholarship/hubbert/jenkins-orphanage.html |archive-date=September 29, 2012 }}</ref> Only a few years later, DuBose Heyward collaborated with [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]] to turn his novel into the now famous opera, ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' (so named to distinguish it from the play).

==Transportation==

===Airport and rail===
The City of Charleston is served by the [[Charleston International Airport]]. It is located in the City of North Charleston and is about {{cvt|12|mi}} northwest of downtown Charleston. It is the busiest passenger airport in South Carolina {{airport codes|CHS|KCHS}}. The airport shares runways with the adjacent [[Charleston Air Force Base]]. [[Charleston Executive Airport]] is a smaller airport located in Charleston's John's Island section and is used by noncommercial aircraft. Both airports are owned and operated by the Charleston County Aviation Authority. As of April 2019, [[British Airways]] does seasonal non-stop flights from Charleston to [[Heathrow Airport|London-Heathrow]].

Charleston is served by two daily [[Amtrak]] trains: [[Palmetto (Amtrak)|The Palmetto]] and [[Silver Meteor]] at [[North Charleston station|the Amtrak station]], located at 4565 Gaynor Avenue in the City of North Charleston, which is approximately 7.5 miles from downtown Charleston.

===Interstates and highways===

[[Interstate 26 in South Carolina|I-26]] begins in Downtown Charleston, with exits to the Septima Clark Expressway, the [[Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge]] and Meeting Street. Heading northwest, it connects the city to [[North Charleston, South Carolina|North Charleston]], the [[Charleston International Airport]], [[Interstate 95 in South Carolina|I-95]], and Columbia. The Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge and Septima Clark Expressway are part of [[U.S. Route 17 in South Carolina|US&nbsp;17]], which travels east–west through Charleston and Mount Pleasant. The Mark Clark Expressway, or [[Interstate 526|I-526]], is the [[Bypass (road)|bypass]] around the city and begins and ends at US&nbsp;17. [[U.S. Route 52 in South Carolina|US&nbsp;52]] is Meeting Street and its [[U,.S. Route 52 Spur (Charleston, South Carolina)|spur]] is East Bay Street, which becomes Morrison Drive after leaving the east side. This highway merges with King Street in the city's Neck area (industrial district). [[U.S. Route 78 in South Carolina|US&nbsp;78]] is King Street in the downtown merging with Meeting Street.

====Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge====
The [[Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge]] across the [[Cooper River (South Carolina)|Cooper River]] opened on July 16, 2005, and was the [[List of longest cable-stayed bridge spans|longest]] [[cable-stayed bridge]] in the Americas at the time of its construction.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The $540 Million Super-Strong, Robust Cable-Stayed Bridge In Charleston {{!}} Manufacturing America |date=March 2, 2015 |url=http://www.magoda.com/construction/the-540-million-super-strong-robust-cable-stayed-bridge-in-charleston/ |access-date=2020-07-31 |language=en-US |archive-date=November 8, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108094450/http://www.magoda.com/construction/the-540-million-super-strong-robust-cable-stayed-bridge-in-charleston/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The bridge links downtown Charleston with Mount Pleasant, and has eight lanes plus a 12-foot lane shared by pedestrians and bicycles. The bridge's height varies but is estimated at 573 feet. It replaced the [[John P. Grace Memorial Bridge|Grace Memorial Bridge]] (built in 1929) and the [[Silas N. Pearman Bridge]] (built in 1966). They were considered two of the more dangerous bridges in America and were demolished after the Ravenel Bridge opened.

===City bus service===
The city is also served by a bus system operated by the [[Charleston Area Regional Transportation Authority]] (CARTA). Most of the urban area is served by regional fixed-route buses equipped with bike racks as part of the system's Rack and Ride program. CARTA offers connectivity to historic downtown attractions and accommodations with the Downtown Area Shuttle trolley buses, and it offers curbside pickup for disabled passengers with its Tel-A-Ride buses. A [[bus rapid transit]] system is in development, called [[Lowcountry Rapid Bus System|Lowcountry Rapid Transit]], that will connect Charleston to Summerville through North Charleston.

Rural parts of the city and metropolitan area are served by a different bus system operated by the Berkeley-Charleston-Dorchester Rural Transportation Management Association. The system is also commonly called the TriCounty Link.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ridetricountylink.com/index.html |title=TriCounty Link rural bus service with flagstop system serving Berkeley, Charleston and Dorchester counties of South Carolina |publisher=Ridetricountylink.com |access-date=September 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101032104/http://www.ridetricountylink.com/index.html |archive-date=November 1, 2014 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Port===
{{Main|Port of Charleston}}
[[File:The 13,092-TEU container ship COSCO Development works at the Port of Charleston's Wando Welch Terminal.jpg|thumb|left|Wanda Welch Terminal in the Port of Charleston]]
The Port of Charleston, owned and operated by the South Carolina Ports Authority, is one of the largest ports in the United States, ranked seventh in the top 25 by [[containerization|containerized cargo]] volume in 2018.<ref name="bts.gov"/> It consists of six terminals, with the sixth opening in April 2021.<ref>{{cite web |title=Charleston Opens First New U.S. Container Terminal in 12 Years |url=https://maritime-executive.com/article/charleston-opens-first-new-u-s-container-terminal-in-12-years |website=The Maritime Executive |access-date=April 10, 2021 |language=en |date=April 9, 2021 |archive-date=April 9, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210409234212/https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/charleston-opens-first-new-u-s-container-terminal-in-12-years |url-status=live }}</ref> Port activity at the two terminals located in the city of Charleston is one of the city's leading sources of revenue, behind tourism.

Today, the Port of Charleston boasts the deepest water in the southeast region and regularly handles ships too big to transit through the [[Panama Canal]]. A harbor-deepening project was completed,<ref>{{cite web |date=October 13, 2020 |title=Harbor Deepening |url=http://scspa.com/facilities/port-expansion/harbor-deepening/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201014010914/http://scspa.com/facilities/port-expansion/harbor-deepening/ |archive-date=October 14, 2020 |access-date=October 13, 2020 |website=South Carolina Ports |language=en}}</ref> which makes the Port of Charleston's entrance channel a depth of {{convert|54|ft}} and harbor channel 52 feet at mean low tide. With an average high tide of {{convert|6|ft}}, the depth clearances will become {{convert|60|ft}} and 58 feet, respectively. At {{convert|52|ft}}, the Port of Charleston is the deepest harbor on the East Coast.<ref>{{Cite web |date=December 5, 2022 |title=Charleston has deepest harbor on East Coast at 52 feet |url=https://scspa.com/news/charleston-has-deepest-harbor-on-east-coast-at-52-feet/ |access-date=April 4, 2024 |website=South Carolina Ports |language=en-US}}</ref>

Part of Union Pier Terminal in Charleston is a cruise ship passenger terminal hosting numerous cruise departures annually through 2019. Beginning in May 2019, until cruise operations were interrupted in April 2020, the [[Carnival Cruise Lines|Carnival]] [[Carnival Sunshine|''Sunshine'']] was permanently stationed in Charleston, offering 4, 5, and 7-day cruises to the [[Caribbean]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Newer, larger Carnival Sunshine to call Charleston home beginning in 2019 |url=https://www.postandcourier.com/business/newer-larger-carnival-sunshine-to-call-charleston-home-beginning-in-2019/article_788e2410-db50-11e7-b310-27d2608ad604.html |website=postandcourier.com |language=en |date=December 7, 2017 |access-date=October 13, 2020 |archive-date=October 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201017144430/https://www.postandcourier.com/business/newer-larger-carnival-sunshine-to-call-charleston-home-beginning-in-2019/article_788e2410-db50-11e7-b310-27d2608ad604.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

With the closure of the Naval Base and the [[Charleston Naval Shipyard]] in 1996, Detyens, Inc. signed a long-term lease. Detyens Shipyard, Inc. is one of the East Coast's most extensive commercial marine repair facilities, with three dry docks, one floating dock, and six piers. Projects include military, commercial, and cruise ships.

The relationship with Spoleto began when Pulitzer Prize-winning Italian composer [[Gian Carlo Menotti]] selected Charleston as the city to host the American version of Spoleto's annual Festival of Two Worlds. "Looking for a city that would provide the charm of Spoleto, as well as its wealth of theaters, churches, and other performance spaces, they selected Charleston, South Carolina, as the ideal location. The historic city provided a perfect fit: intimate enough that the Festival would captivate the entire city, yet cosmopolitan enough to provide an enthusiastic audience and robust infrastructure."<ref name="charlestonspoleto.org"/>
