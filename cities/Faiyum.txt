Originally founded by the ancient Egyptians as Shedet, its current name in English is also spelled as '''Fayum''', '''Faiyum''' or '''al-Faiyūm'''. Faiyum was also previously officially named '''Madīnat al-Faiyūm''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] for ''The City of Faiyum''). The name Faiyum (and its spelling variations) may also refer to the [[Faiyum Oasis]], although it is commonly used by [[Egyptians]] today to refer to the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trismegistos.org/fayum/fayum2/gen_name.php |title=The name of the Fayum province.

The modern name of the city comes from [[Coptic language|Coptic]] {{Coptic|&nbsp;&#x300;Ⲫⲓⲟⲙ}} /{{Coptic|Ⲡⲉⲓⲟⲙ}} ''{{transl|cop|epʰiom/peiom}}'' (whence also the personal name {{Coptic|Ⲡⲁⲓⲟⲙ}} ''{{transl|cop|payom}}''), meaning ''the Sea'' or ''the Lake'', which in turn comes from late [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''pꜣ-ym'' of the same meaning, a reference to the nearby [[Lake Moeris]]; the extinct elephant ancestor ''[[Phiomia]]'' was named after it.

{{Redirect|Crocodilopolis|the namesake sites in Upper Egypt and Israel|Crocodilopolis (disambiguation)}}
Archaeological evidence has found occupations around the Faiyum dating back to at least the [[Epipalaeolithic]]. Middle [[Holocene]] occupations of the area are most widely studied on the north shore of [[Lake Moeris]], where [[Gertrude Caton Thompson]] and [[Elinor Wight Gardner]] did a number of excavations of Epipalaeolithic and [[Neolithic]] sites, as well as a general survey of the area.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Desert Fayum|author1=Caton-Thompson, G.  |author2=Gardner, E.|publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|year=1934|location=London}}</ref> Recently the area has been further investigated by a team from the UCLA/RUG/UOA Fayum Project.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Holdaway|first1=Simon|last2=Phillipps|first2=Rebecca|last3=Emmitt|first3=Joshua|last4=Wendrich|first4=Willeke|date=2016-07-29|title=The Fayum revisited: Reconsidering the role of the Neolithic package, Fayum north shore, Egypt|journal=Quaternary International|series=The Neolithic from the Sahara to the Southern Mediterranean Coast: A review of the most Recent Research|volume=410, Part A|pages=173–180|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2015.11.072|bibcode=2016QuInt.410..173H }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Phillipps|first1=Rebecca|last2=Holdaway|first2=Simon|last3=Ramsay|first3=Rebecca|last4=Emmitt|first4=Joshua|last5=Wendrich|first5=Willeke|last6=Linseele|first6=Veerle|date=2016-05-18|title=Lake Level Changes, Lake Edge Basins and the Paleoenvironment of the Fayum North Shore, Egypt, during the Early to Mid-Holocene|journal=Open Quaternary|volume=2|doi=10.5334/oq.19|issn=2055-298X|doi-access=free|hdl=2292/28957|hdl-access=free}}</ref>

According to [[Roger S.

In consequence, the Greeks called it "Crocodile City" ({{langx|grc-x-koine|Κροκοδειλόπολις}} ''Krokodeilópolis''), which was borrowed into Latin as ''Crocodīlopolis''. The city worshipped a tamed sacred crocodile called, in Koine, ''[[Petsuchos]]'', "the Son of Soukhos", that was adorned with gold and gem pendants. The Petsoukhos lived in a special temple pond and was fed by the priests with food provided by visitors.

Under the [[Roman Empire]], Arsinoë became part of the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Arcadia Aegypti]]. To distinguish it from other cities of the same name, it was called "Arsinoë in Arcadia".

With the arrival of [[Christianity]], Arsinoë became the seat of a [[bishopric]], a [[suffragan]] of [[Oxyrhynchus]], the capital of the province and the [[metropolitan see]]. [[Michel Le Quien]] gives the names of several bishops of Arsinoë, nearly all of them associated with one [[heresy]] or another.<ref>{{cite book|last=Le Quien|first=Michel|author-link=Michel Le Quien|title=Oriens christianus: in quatuor patriarchatus digestus : quo exhibentur ecclesiae, patriarchae caeterique praesules totius orientis|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_86weAemI-e4C|year=1740|publisher=ex Typographia Regia}}, Vol. II, coll. 581-584</ref>

The [[Catholic Church]], considering Arsinoë in Arcadia to be no longer a residential bishopric, lists it as a [[titular see]].<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 840</ref>

The 10th-century Bible exegete, [[Saadia Gaon]], thought ''el-Fayyum'' to have actually been the biblical city of [[Pithom]], mentioned in Exodus 1:11.<ref>Saadia Gaon, ''Tafsir'' (Judeo-Arabic translation of the Pentateuch), Exodus 1:11; ''Rabbi Saadia Gaon's Commentaries on the Torah'' (ed.

Faiyum is the source of some famous [[death mask]]s or [[mummy]] portraits painted during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] occupation of the area. The Egyptians continued their practice of burying their dead, despite the Roman preference for [[cremation]]. While under the control of the Roman Empire, Egyptian death masks were painted on wood in a pigmented [[wax]] technique called [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]]—the [[Fayum mummy portraits|Faiyum mummy portraits]] represent this technique.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encaustic.ca/html/history.html |title=History of Encaustic Art |publisher=Encaustic.ca |date=2012-06-10 |access-date=2013-01-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121223091730/http://www.encaustic.ca/html/history.html |archive-date=2012-12-23}}</ref> While previously believed to represent Greek settlers in Egypt,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.egyptologyonline.com/mummy_portraits.htm |title=Egyptology Online: Fayoum mummy portraits |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808184841/http://www.egyptologyonline.com/mummy_portraits.htm |archive-date=August 8, 2007 |access-date=January 16, 2007}}</ref><ref>[https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-59912/Egyptian-art-and-architecture/ Encyclopædia Britannica Online - Egyptian art and architecture - Greco-Roman Egypt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528070847/https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-59912/Egyptian-art-and-architecture |date=2007-05-28 }} accessed on January 16, 2007</ref> modern studies conclude that the Faiyum portraits instead represent mainly native Egyptians, reflecting the complex synthesis of the predominant Egyptian culture and that of the elite Greek minority in the city.<ref>Bagnall, R.S. in Susan Walker, ed.

It is, of course, impossible to answer this question definitively. But research in papyri dating from the early centuries of the common era demonstrates that a significant amount of intermarriage took place between the Greek and Egyptian communities [...] And it is known that Greek marriage contracts increasingly came to resemble Egyptian ones. In addition, even from the founding of Alexandria, small numbers of Egyptians were admitted to the privileged classes in the city to fulfil numerous civic roles. Of course, it was essential in such cases for the Egyptians to become "Hellenized," to adopt Greek habits and the Greek language. Given that the Alexandrian mathematicians mentioned here were active several hundred years after the founding of the city, it would seem at least equally possible that they were ethnically Egyptian as that they remained ethnically Greek. In any case, it is unreasonable to portray them with purely European features when no physical descriptions exist.''"</ref>

The construction of the settlement of ''Philadelphia'' under Ptolemy II Philadelphus was recorded in detail by a 3rd-century BC Greek public official named [[Zenon of Kaunos|Zeno]] (or Zenon, {{langx|el|Ζήνων}}). Zeno, a native of [[Kaunos]] in lower [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], came to Faiyum to work as private secretary to [[Apollonius (dioiketes)|Apollonius]], the finance minister to Ptolemy II Philadelphus (and later to [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]]). During his employment, Zeno wrote detailed descriptions of the construction of theatres, gymnasiums, palaces and baths in the 250s and 240s BC, as well as making copious written records of various legal and financial transactions between citizens.<ref name="McKenzie" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Who was Zenon |url=https://www.lib.umich.edu/reading/Zenon/WhowasZenon.html |website=apps.lib.umich.edu |publisher=[[University of Michigan]]|access-date=20 April 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Philadelpheia (Gharabet el-Gerza) |url=https://www.trismegistos.org/place/1760 |website=www.trismegistos.org |publisher=TM Places |access-date=20 April 2021}}</ref><ref name="zenonwhere">{{cite web |title=Where do the Zenon Papyri come from? |url=https://apps.lib.umich.edu/reading/Zenon/zenonwhere.html |website=apps.lib.umich.edu |publisher=[[University of Michigan]] |access-date=20 April 2021}}</ref>

During the winter of 1914–1915, a cache of over 2,000 [[papyrus]] documents was uncovered by Egyptian agricultural labourers who were digging for [[sebakh]] near [[Kôm el-Kharaba el-Kebir]].
