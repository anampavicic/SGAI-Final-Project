'''Ryazan Oblast''' ({{langx|ru|Рязанская область|Ryazanskaya oblast'}}, {{IPA|ru|rʲɪˈzanskəjə ˈobləsʲtʲ|IPA}}) is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]] (an [[oblast]]). Its [[administrative center]] is the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of [[Ryazan]], which is also the oblast's largest city.

==Geography==
{{Unsourced|section|date=October 2022}}
Ryazan Oblast borders [[Vladimir Oblast]] (N), [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast]] (NE), the [[Republic of Mordovia]] (E), [[Penza Oblast]] (SE), [[Tambov Oblast]] (S), [[Lipetsk Oblast]] (SW), [[Tula Oblast]] (W), and [[Moscow Oblast]] (NW).

In terms of physical geography, Ryazan Oblast lies in the central part of the [[Russian Plain]] between the [[Central Russian Upland|Central Russian]] and [[Volga Upland|Volga]] uplands. The terrain is flat, with the highest point of no more than 300 m above sea level. Soils are podzolic and boggy on the left bank of the [[Oka River|Oka]], changing southward to more fertile podzolic and leached black-earths ([[chernozem|chernozyom]]).

===Hydrography===
[[File:RybnoeDistrict 06-13 Konstantinovo Oka River 01.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Oka River]] near [[Konstantinovo, Rybnovsky District, Ryazan Oblast|Konstantinovo]] in [[Rybnovsky District]] of Ryazan Oblast]]

Most of the Ryazan Oblast lies within the [[Volga basin]], with the [[Oka River|Oka]] the principal river of the area.

==History==
{{Unsourced|section|date=October 2022}}
Human occupation of the area of the Ryazan Oblast dates from at least the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period. [[East Slavs]], [[Volga Finns|Volga Finnic]], Tatar tribes inhabited the area and merged into an ethnos,  a process virtually completed by the 13th century CE.  In 830 the Ryazan area became part of [[Rus' Khaganate]].

Later the Ryazan area became part of the [[Kievan Rus']] political system and came under the domination of the [[Principality of Chernigov]] (founded in 988). The [[Principality of Ryazan]] operated as a separate entity from 1097 to 1521, when the area became part of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]], though with the [[Qasim Khanate]] district retaining some autonomy until the 1550s.

The [[Ryazan Governorate]] became separate from the [[Moscow Governorate]] in 1796.

=== Soviet Union ===
Ryazan Oblast was formed out of the [[Moscow Oblast|Moscow]] and [[Voronezh Oblast|Voronezh]] oblasts in 1937. It took its present form in 1954 when some of its southern districts were ceded to the newly established [[Lipetsk Oblast]]. Also in 1954, it was ceded parts of southern [[Moscow Oblast]] and no border changes happened afterward.

=== Soviet Union ===
In the post-war period of the Soviet Union recovery in the wake of growing [[Cold War|competition between USSR and US]] several ambitious plans severely undermined the economical stability of the region. In Ryazan Oblast, at the behest of central government led by [[Nikita Khrushchev]] a regional administration ordered slaughter of livestock in a futile attempt to boost productivity rates (plans included tripling of meat and milk production). Because of series of misjudgement and overestimations these plans resulted in disastrous failure which is known today as [[Ryazan miracle]] ({{Langx|ru|Рязанское чудо}}).
