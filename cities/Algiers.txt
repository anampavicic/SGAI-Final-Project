The Greeks [[folk etymology|explained the name]] as coming from their word for "twenty" ({{lang|grc|εἴκοσι}}, {{Lang|grc-latn|eíkosi}}), supposedly because it had been founded by 20 companions of [[Hercules]] when he visited the [[Atlas Mountains]] during [[Labors of Hercules|his labors]].<ref name=backtalk>{{cite book | author = Edward Lipiński | date = 2004 | title = Itineraria Phoenicia | publisher = Peeters Publishers | page = 403 | isbn = 978-90-429-1344-8 | oclc = 1026236463 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SLSzNfdcqfoC&pg=PA403 | access-date = 2018-12-04 | archive-date = 2019-12-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191223031423/https://books.google.com/books?id=SLSzNfdcqfoC&pg=PA403 | url-status = live }}</ref>

===Early history===
{{main|Icosium}}
The city's history is believed to date back to 1200 BC, but it was a small settlement without any significance until around the 3rd century BC when "Ikosim" became a small port town in [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] where [[Phoenicians]] were trading with other Mediterranean ports. After the [[Battle of Cirta]], [[Numidia]] got a hold of the town along with its neighboring regions at around 202 BC, after which the [[Punic wars]] started weakening the [[Berbers|Berber]] nation. On 104 BC, following the capturing of [[Jughurta]] and executing him in [[Rome]], the western half of his nation was given to  [[Mauretania]] under the rule of [[Bocchus I]]. At around 42 AD, [[Claudius]] divided  Mauretania into two provinces, [[Mauretania Caesariensis]] that included [[Icosium]] as one of its towns; the second province was [[Mauretania Tingitana]] and were deemed as Roman [[Municipium]]s, additionally they were given [[Latin rights]] by the emperor [[Vespasian]]. In 371-373 AD, Mauretania revolted with the help of [[Firmus]] in hopes of installing an independent State and [[Icosium]] was raided and damaged. Some clues show the presence of [[bishop]]s in the region at this time.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=655}}

In 435 AD, the [[Vandal Kingdom]] took control of [[northern Africa]] along the coasts of today's [[Tunisia]] and [[Algeria]]. The [[Western Roman Empire]] that was ruling the area allowed the Vandals to settle when it became clear that they could not be defeated by Roman military forces. Though the city was damaged again due to the fighting between the two armies, the town was still slowly growing in population.

===Medieval history===
In 534 AD, the Vandal kingdom was subjugated by the general [[Belisarius]] of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], making Icosium a part of the empire. In the early 7th century, "Beni Mezghenna" who are a [[Berbers|Berber]] tribe belonging to the [[Sanhaja]] as cited by [[Ibn Khaldoun]], settled on the plains of [[Icosium]] and the surrounding areas.<ref>entre MIHOUB et TABLAT Histoire et des Berbères et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique … De ʻAbd al-Raḥman b. Muḥammad Ibn Khaldûn, {{p.|8}} [https://books.google.fr/books?id=3dYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA5&dq=ibn+khaldoun+mezghanna&lr=#PPA6,M1 Lire en ligne]</ref> Shortly after, in the late 7th century, the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb]] brought the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] into the region, but were faced with resistance from Berber forces led by [[Kahina]] and [[Kusaila]] in the 680s, who opposed the advancing Islamic armies. However, [[Hassan ibn al-Nu'man]] and [[Musa ibn Nusayr]] later defeated both Berber leaders, killing Kusaila at the [[Battle of Mamma]] (688) and killing Dihya at the [[Battle of Tabarka]] (702), leading to the subjugation of the Berber tribes, bringing Islamic rule into North Africa. The [[Abbasid Caliphate]] succeeded [[Umayyad Caliphate]] at around 750 AD. Independence movements across the [[Maghreb]] resulted in the breaking of two nations, the [[Idrisid dynasty]] and the [[Aghlabid Emirate]] but acted as agents of the [[Abbasids]] in [[Baghdad]]. Icosium fell into the hands of Aghlabids and abandoned the town. They were then overthrown by the [[Fatimids]] in 909 AD, who went on to control all of [[Ifriqiya]] by 969 AD.

The present city was re-founded in 972 AD by [[Buluggin ibn Ziri]], who was appointed by the Faṭimid caliph [[al-Muʿizz]] as governor of [[al-Qayrawān]] and any other territory his nation, the [[Zirid Dynasty]] might reclaim from its enemies, the [[Zenata]] tribesmen. His state accordingly expanded its boundaries westward. In approximately 1014 AD, under the reign of [[Badis ibn al-Mansur]], the dynasty was divided between the Zirids at al-Qayrawan in the east, and the [[Hammadids]] at [[Qal'at Bani Hammad]]; "Jazaʾir Banī Mazghanna", commonly known as "Algiers" as the new name of [[Icosium]] was absorbed into the [[Hammadid dynasty]]<ref name="Ruedy2005">{{cite book | author = John Ruedy | date = 12 August 2005 | title = Modern Algeria, Second Edition: The Origins and Development of a Nation | publisher = Indiana University Press | pages = 13– | isbn = 978-0-253-21782-0 | oclc = 1025661094 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WIRWgrbE_fEC&pg=PA13 | access-date = 6 November 2015 | archive-date = 21 May 2024 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20240521144644/https://books.google.com/books?id=WIRWgrbE_fEC&pg=PA13 | url-status = live }}</ref> who in 1067 AD relocated to [[Bejaia]] and carried on a lively trade while most of North Africa was under a state of [[anarchy]].{{citation needed|date=October 2024}}

In 1079 AD, [[Ibn Tashfin]], a Sanhaja leader of the [[Almoravid Empire]] sent an army of 20,000 men from Marrakesh to push towards what is now [[Tlemcen]] to attack the "Banu Ya'la", the [[Zenata]] tribe occupying the area. Led by [[Mazdali ibn Tilankan]], the army defeated the Banu Ya'la in battle near the valley of the [[Moulouya River]] and executed their commander, the son of Tlemcen's ruler. However, [[Mazdali ibn Tilankan]] did not push to Tlemcen right away as the city of [[Oujda]] was too strong to capture. Instead, Ibn Tashfin himself returned with an army in 1081 AD that captured Oujda and then conquered Tlemcen, massacring the [[Maghrawa]] forces there and their leader; He pressed on and by 1082 AD he had captured "Jazaʾir Banī Mazghanna".

In 1151 AD, [[Abd al-Mu'min]] launched an expedition to the east, conquering [[Bejaia]] in August 1152, the capital of the Hammadids; on their way, Beni Mezghanna did not succumb and was now under the [[Almohad Caliphate]]'s control. The caliphate suffered from states breaking out of its rule, most notably, the [[Kingdom of Tlemcen]] in 1235 AD. The town once again came under the dominion of the [[Ziyanid]] [[sultans]] of the Kingdom but experienced a large measure of independence under [[Thaaliba]] [[amirs]] who settled the [[Mitidja]] plain at around 1200 AD.

===Early modern history===
[[File:Algiers islets.svg|thumb|Illustration of the [[islet]]s off the coast of Algiers before Pier "Kheireddine" was built.]]
The [[Kingdom of Tlemcen]] was the target of the [[Spanish Empire]]'s and the [[Portuguese Empire]]'s campaigns and conquests against its coasts, beginning in 1501 AD. However, Algiers continued to be of comparatively little importance until after the [[Reconquista#Conversions and expulsions|expulsion of the Moors]] from Spain, many of whom sought asylum in the city, after which the Spanish led by [[Pedro Navarro]] established a fortified base and [[garrison]] on one of the [[islet]]s off the coast of Algiers, and named it "Peñón de Argel" or Peñón of Algiers, . By that time, Algiers had an [[emir]], Salim al-Thumi who had to "swear obedience and loyalty" to [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] who also imposed a levy intended to suppress the [[Barbary pirates]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=655}}<ref name="Çelik1997">{{cite book | author = Zeynep Çelik | date = 1997 | title = Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers Under French Rule | publisher = University of California Press | page = 13 | isbn = 978-0-520-20457-7 | oclc = 208879670 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hSSLQgAACAAJ | access-date = 2023-02-09 | archive-date = 2023-02-09 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20230209020213/https://books.google.com/books?id=hSSLQgAACAAJ | url-status = live }}</ref>

Oruç Reis came to Algiers, ordered the assassination of Selim, and seized the town and ousted the Spanish in the [[Capture of Algiers (1516)]]. Hayreddin, succeeding Oruç after the latter was killed in battle against the Spaniards in the [[Fall of Tlemcen (1518)|1518 fall of Tlemcen]], was the founder of the ''[[pashaluk]]'', which subsequently became the ''[[bey]]lik'', of Algeria. Barbarossa lost Algiers in 1524 but regained it with the [[Capture of Peñón of Algiers (1529)|1529 Capture of Peñón of Algiers]], and then formally invited the Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] to accept sovereignty over the territory and to annex Algiers to the [[Ottoman Empire]].

Algiers from this time became the chief seat of the [[Barbary pirates]]. In October 1541 in the [[Algiers expedition (1541)|Algiers expedition]], the King of Spain and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] sought to capture the city, but a storm destroyed a great number of his ships, and his army of some 30,000, chiefly made up of Spaniards, was defeated by the Algerians under their [[pasha]], Hassan.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=655}}

Formally part of the Ottoman Empire but essentially free from Ottoman control, starting in the 16th century Algiers turned to piracy and ransoming. Due to its location on the periphery of both the Ottoman and European economic spheres, and depending for its existence on a Mediterranean that was increasingly controlled by European shipping, backed by European navies, piracy became the primary economic activity. Repeated attempts were made by various nations to subdue the pirates that disturbed shipping in the western Mediterranean and engaged in slave raids as far north as Iceland.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.heimaslod.is/index.php/Tyrkjar%C3%A1ni%C3%B0 |title=Tyrkjaránið – Heimaslóð |language=is |publisher=Heimaslod.is |access-date=2010-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527072348/http://www.heimaslod.is/index.php/Tyrkjar%C3%A1ni%C3%B0 |archive-date=2011-05-27 |url-status=live }}</ref> By the 17th century, up to 40% of the city's 100,000 inhabitants were enslaved Europeans.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4547299|title=From Amrum to Algiers and Back: The Reintegration of a Renegade in the Eighteenth Century|author=Martin Reinheimer|journal=Central European History|year=2003|volume=36|issue=2|pages=209–233|access-date=2021-06-23|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|doi=10.1163/156916103770866121|jstor=4547299|s2cid=143504775|archive-date=2022-03-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220330122726/https://www.jstor.org/stable/4547299|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[United States]] fought two wars (the [[First Barbary War|First]] and [[Second Barbary War]]s) over Algiers' attacks on shipping.

Among the notable people held for ransom was the future Spanish novelist, [[Miguel de Cervantes]], who was held captive in Algiers for almost five years, and wrote two plays set in Algiers of the period.

A significant number of renegades lived in Algiers at the time, Christians converted voluntarily to [[Islam]], many fleeing the law or other problems at home. Once converted to Islam, they were safe in Algiers.

The city under Ottoman control was enclosed by a wall on all sides, including along the seafront. In this wall, five gates allowed access to the city, with five roads from each gate dividing the city and meeting in front of the Ketchaoua Mosque. In 1556, a citadel, [[Palace of the Dey]] was constructed at the highest point in the wall. A major road running north to south divided the city in two: The upper city (al-Gabal, or 'the mountain') which consisted of about fifty small quarters of [[Andalusians|Andalusian]], [[Algerian Jews|Jewish]], [[Moors|Moorish]] and [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] communities, and the lower city (al-Wata, or 'the plains') which was the administrative, military and commercial centre of the city, mostly inhabited by [[Kouloughlis|Ottoman Turkish dignitaries]] and other upper-class families.<ref>Celik, Zeynep, ''Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers Under French Rule'', University of California Press, 1997, pp. 13–14.</ref>

[[France]] and the [[Regency of Algiers]] had a commercial–political conflict called the [[Bakri-Busnach affair]] which has been bothering both nations in the 19th century.
On April 29, 1827, foreign consuls and diplomatic agents gathered in the [[Palace of the Dey]] for a conference with the [[Regency of Algiers]] ruler [[Hussein Dey]]. Tensions were high because of [[France]]'s failure to pay outstanding debts. In a heated moment later referred to as "fly-whisk incident", the [[Dey]] struck the French consul in the face with the handle of a [[fly-whisk]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Raf |first1=Mohh |title=The Fly Whisk Incident |url=https://gloriousalgeria.dz/En/Post/show/92/The-Fly-Whisk-Incident |website=gloriousalgeria.dz |access-date=1 September 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Raf |first1=Mohh |title=Fly Whisk Incident (1827) |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/fly-whisk-incident-1827 |website=encyclopedia.com |publisher=Kenneth J.

In an attempt by [[Charles X of France]] to increase his popularity amongst the French, he sought to bolster [[patriotic sentiment]], and turn eyes away from his domestic policies, by treating the incident as a public insult and demanded an apology. Failure to respond was met by operations against the dey.<ref name="EncBrit">{{cite encyclopedia |title= Algeria, Colonial Rule|access-date=2007-12-19 |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |page= 39 |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-220553/Algeria#487751.hook}}</ref> A naval siege on the port of Algiers by the [[French Navy]] began the following days which lasted 3 years and impacted the French and Algerian economies due to their former extensive trade treaties.

Tensions only continued rising while the [[French Armed Forces]] were preparing for the [[invasion of Algiers in 1830|1830 invasion of Algiers]]. The naval fleet departed from [[Touron]] on May 25, 1830, and successfully reached the western coast of the Regency near what is today [[Sidi Fredj]] on June 14, 1830. The Algerian forces met their French opponents in the "Battle of Sidi Fredj" on June 19, 1830, to which the [[Dey]]'s forces were defeated, this enabled the colonial army to advance into the city and made [[Hussein Dey]] surrender to French [[Louis-Auguste-Victor, Count de Ghaisnes de Bourmont|General de Bourmont]] on 5 July 1830.

===French rule===

Under French rule, Algiers became the capital of [[French Algeria]], "an integral part of the [[French Republic]]" according to a formal annexation declared on June 22, 1834.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Raf |first1=Mohh |title=The end of the Ottoman Regency and the limited occupation of Algeria |url=https://www.musee-armee.fr/ExpositionAlgerie/the-end-of-the-ottoman-regency-and-the-limited-occupation-of-algeria.html |website=musee-armee |access-date=1 September 2024}}</ref> France focused their interest into areas inhabited by locals, this in turn was the [[French conquest of Algeria]] that shared goals with its [[Pacification of Algeria|pacification]] efforts; Establishing a European [[Culture of Europe|cultural]], [[economic]] and [[political]] presence in [[Africa]] without considering the [[indigenous population]]'s lifestyle or connection to their land.

The city had a minority of "[[Pieds-noirs]]", [[Jews]] and [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] [[settlers]] due to laws and regulations put by the French government that granted [[French citizenship]] to them under the [[Crémieux Decree]] while releasing [[Code de l'indigénat]] giving inferiority to the "Arabs" and "Muslims" which were getting forcibly removed from their land in favor of building settlements.

Many Europeans settled in Algiers, and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the city's population.<ref>Albert Habib Hourani, Malise Ruthven (2002). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=egbOb0mewz4C&pg=PA323 A history of the Arab peoples] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906022938/https://books.google.com/books?id=egbOb0mewz4C&pg=PA323&dq&hl=en |date=2015-09-06 }}''". Harvard University Press. p.323. {{ISBN|0-674-01017-5}}</ref> During the 1930s, the architect [[Le Corbusier]] drew up plans for a complete redesign of the colonial city. Le Corbusier was highly critical of the urban style of Algiers, describing the European district as "nothing but crumbling walls and devastated nature, the whole a sullied blot". He also criticised the difference in living standards he perceived between the European and African residents of the city, describing a situation in which "the 'civilised' live like rats in holes" whereas "the 'barbarians' live in solitude, in well-being".<ref>Celik, Zeynep, ''Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers Under French Rule'', University of California Press, 1997, p. 5.</ref> However, these plans were ultimately ignored by the French administration.

During [[World War II]], Algiers was the first city to be seized from the Axis by the Allies in [[Operation Terminal]], a part of [[Operation Torch]].

===Algerian War===
[[File:1962-03-22 Algeria tense cease fire.ogv|thumb|right|The "tense truce" between Algerian rebels, French army and the OAS in 1962]]
Algiers also played a pivotal role in the [[Algerian War]] (1954–1962), a bloody independence struggle in which hundreds of thousands (estimates range between 350,000 and 1,500,000) died (mostly Algerians but also French and [[Pied-Noir|Pieds-Noirs]]). In particular, it saw the [[Algerian War#Battle of Algiers|Battle of Algiers]] when the 10th Parachute Division of the French Army, starting on January 7, 1957, and on the orders of the French Minister of Justice [[François Mitterrand]] (who authorized any means "to eliminate the insurrectionists"{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}), led attacks against the Algerian fighters for independence. Algiers remains marked by this battle, which was characterized by merciless fighting between FLN forces which carried out a guerrilla campaign against the French military and police and pro-French Algerian soldiers, and the French Army which responded with a bloody repression, torture and blanket terrorism against the native population. The demonstrations of May 13 during the crisis of 1958 provoked the fall of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] in France, as well as the return of General [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] to power.

===Independence===
Algeria achieved [[independence]] on July 5, 1962, with Algiers as its capital. Since then, despite losing its entire ''[[pied-noir]]'' population, the city has expanded massively. It now has about five million inhabitants, or 10 percent of Algeria's population—and its suburbs now cover most of the surrounding [[Geography of Algeria|Mitidja]] plain. Run by the FLN that had secured independence, Algiers became a member of [[Non-Aligned Movement]] during the [[Cold War]]. In October 1988, one year before the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], Algiers was the site of demonstrations demanding the end of the single-party system and the creation of a ''real'' [[democracy]] baptized the "Spring of Algiers". The demonstrators were repressed by the authorities (more than 300 dead), but the movement constituted a turning point in the political history of modern Algeria. The [[1989 Algerian constitutional referendum]] took place and a new constitution was adopted that put an end to the one-party rule and saw the creation of more than fifty political parties, as well as official freedom of the press.

===Crisis of the 1990s===
The city became the theatre of many political demonstrations of all descriptions until 1993. In 1991, a political entity dominated by religious conservatives called the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] engaged in a political test of wills with the authorities. In the 1992 elections for the Algerian National Assembly, the Islamists garnered a large amount of support in the first round. Fearing an eventual win by the Islamists, the army canceled the election process, setting off the [[Algerian Civil War|civil war]] between the State and armed religious conservatives which would last for a decade.

* '''[[Casbah of Algiers|The Casbah]]''' (of ''Al Qasbah'', "the Citadel"), 1st District of Algiers: called ''Al-Djazaïr Al Mahroussa'' ("Well Kept Algiers"), is founded on the ruins of old Icosium. It is a small city of picturesque winding lanes built on a hill and descending towards the sea, divided into two sections: the High City and the Low City. It includes 17th-century buildings: [[Ketchaoua Mosque]] (rebuilt in the 18th century by the [[Hasan Pasha (son of Barbarossa)|Dey Baba Hassan]]), [[Djamaa el Djedid|El Djedid Mosque]] (built in 1660, at the time of Turkish regency), [[Djamaa el Kebir|El Kebir Mosque]] (oldest of the mosques, built by [[Almoravid]] [[Youssef Ibn Tachfin]] and rebuilt in 1794), the [[Ali Bitchin Mosque]] (Raïs, 1623), and [[Dar Aziza]], formerly part of the Palace of Jénina.
* ''' [[Bab El Oued]]''': Literally ''the River's Gate'', the popular district which extends from the Casbah beyond "the gate of the river". It is the capital's darling and best liked borough. Famous for its square with "the three clocks" and for its "market Triplet", it is also a district of workshops and manufacturing plants.
* ''' [[Edge of sea]]''': from 1840, the architects Pierre-August Guiauchain and [[Charles Frédéric Chassériau]] designed new buildings apart from the Casbah, town hall, law courts, buildings, theatre, palace of the Governor, and casino, to form an elegant walk bordered by arcades which is today the boulevard [[Che Guevara]] (formerly the Boulevard of the [[Republic]]).
* ''' [[Kouba, Algeria|Kouba]]''' ([[will daira]] of [[Hussein-dey]]): Kouba is an old village which was absorbed by the expansion of the town of Algiers. Kouba quickly developed under the French colonial era then continued growing due to formidable demographic expansion that Algiers saw after the independence of Algeria in 1962. It is today a district of Algiers which is largely made up of houses, villas, and buildings not exceeding five stories.
* [[El Harrach]], a suburb of Algiers, is located about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} to the east of the city.
* The communes of [[Hydra (Algiers) will|Hydra]], [[Ben Aknoun]], [[El-Biar]] and [[Bouzareah]] form what the inhabitants of Algiers call the "Heights of Algiers". These communes shelter the majority of the foreign embassies of Algiers, of many ministries and university centres, which makes it one of the administrative and policy centres of the country.
* The '''Didouche Mourad street''' is located in the 3rd district Of Algiers. It extends from the '''Grande Post office''' to the Heights of Algiers. It crosses in particular the '''place Audin''', '''the [[Algiers 1 University|Faculty of Algiers]]''', '''The Crowned Heart''' and '''the Freedom Park (formerly Galland)'''. It is bordered by smart stores and restaurants along most of its length. It is regarded as the heart of the capital.

===Climate===
Algiers has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csa''). Its proximity to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] aids in moderating the city's temperatures. As a result, Algiers usually does not see the extreme temperatures that are experienced in the adjacent interior. Algiers on average receives roughly {{convert|600|mm|in|0}} of rain per year, the bulk of which is seen between October and April. The precipitation is higher than in most of coastal Mediterranean [[Spain]], and similar to most of coastal Mediterranean [[France]], as opposed to the interior North African semi-arid or arid climate.

Snow is very rare; in 2012, the city received {{convert|100|mm|in|0}} of snowfall, its first snowfall in eight years.<ref>{{cite news |title=European Chill Moves West, 122 Die in Ukraine |first=Richard |last=Balmforth |date=4 February 2012 |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-weather-idUSTRE8130NK20120204 |access-date=30 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914142912/http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/04/us-europe-weather-idUSTRE8130NK20120204 |archive-date=14 September 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Climate change ====
A 2019 paper published in [[PLOS One]] estimated that under [[Representative Concentration Pathway#4.5|Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5]], a "moderate" scenario of [[climate change]] where global warming reaches ~{{convert|2.5-3|C-change|F-change}} by 2100, the climate of Algiers in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of [[Perth]] in [[Australia]]. The annual temperature would increase by {{convert|2.6|C-change|F-change}}, and the temperature of the warmest month by {{convert|1.9|C-change|F-change}}, while the temperature of the coldest month would be {{convert|3.8|C-change|F-change}} higher.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bastin |first1=Jean-Francois |last2=Clark |first2=Emily |last3=Elliott |first3=Thomas |last4=Hart |first4=Simon |last5=van den Hoogen |first5=Johan |last6=Hordijk |first6=Iris |last7=Ma |first7=Haozhi |last8=Majumder |first8=Sabiha |last9=Manoli |first9=Gabriele |last10=Maschler |first10=Julia |last11=Mo |first11=Lidong |last12=Routh |first12=Devin |last13=Yu |first13=Kailiang |last14=Zohner |first14=Constantin M. |last15=Thomas W. |first15=Crowther |title=Understanding climate change from a global analysis of city analogues |journal=PLOS ONE |date=10 July 2019 |volume=14 |issue=7 |at=S2 Table.

Moreover, according to the 2022 [[IPCC Sixth Assessment Report]], Algiers is one of 12 major African cities ([[Abidjan]], [[Alexandria]], Algiers, [[Cape Town]], [[Casablanca]], [[Dakar]], [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Durban]], [[Lagos]], [[Lomé]], [[Luanda]] and [[Maputo]]) which would be the most severely affected by the future [[sea level rise]]. It estimates that they would collectively sustain cumulative damages of U$65&nbsp;billion under RCP&nbsp;4.5 and US$86.5&nbsp;billion for the high-emission scenario RCP&nbsp;8.5 by the year 2050. Additionally, RCP&nbsp;8.5 combined with the hypothetical impact from [[marine ice sheet instability]] at high levels of warming would involve up to US$137.5 billion in damages, while the additional accounting for the "low-probability, high-damage events" may increase aggregate risks to $187&nbsp;billion for the "moderate" RCP&nbsp;4.5, $206&nbsp;billion for RCP&nbsp;8.5 and $397&nbsp;billion under the high-end ice sheet instability scenario.<ref name="AR6Ch9"/> Since sea level rise would continue for about 10,000 years under every scenario of climate change, future costs of sea level rise would only increase, especially without adaptation measures.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Full_Report.pdf |title=Technical Summary.

There are many public buildings of interest, including the whole [[Kasbah]] quarter, Martyrs Square (''Sahat ech-Chouhada'' ساحة الشهداء), the government offices (formerly the [[United Kingdom|British]] consulate), the "[[Djamaa el Kebir|Grand]]", "[[Djamaa el Djedid|New]]", and [[Ketchaoua Mosque|Ketchaoua]] Mosques, the [[Roman Catholic]] cathedral of [[Notre Dame d'Afrique]], the [[Bardo National Museum of Prehistory and Ethnography|Bardo Museum]], the old ''Bibliothèque Nationale d'Alger''—a moorish palace built in 1799–1800 and the new [[National Library of Algeria|National Library]], built in a style reminiscent of the [[British Library]].

The main building in the Kasbah was begun in 1516 on the site of an older building, and served as the palace of the deys until the French conquest. A road has been cut through the centre of the building, the mosque turned into [[barracks]], and the hall of audience allowed to fall into ruin. There still remain a [[minaret]] and some marble arches and columns. Traces exist of the vaults in which were stored the treasures of the dey.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=654}}

[[Djamaa el Kebir]] (''Jamaa-el-Kebir'' الجامع الكبير) is the oldest mosque in Algiers. It was first built by [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], but reconstructed many times. The pulpit (''[[minbar]]'' منبر) bears an inscription showing that the building existed in 1097. The minaret was built by the sultan of [[Tlemcen]], in 1324.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8764/ |title = Fountain in Mosque of El Kebir, Algiers, Algeria |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1899 |access-date = 2013-09-24 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130927125712/http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8764/ |archive-date = 2013-09-27 |url-status = live }}</ref> The interior of the mosque is square and is divided into aisles by columns joined by [[Moors|Moorish]] arches.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=654}}

The [[Djamaa el Djedid|New Mosque]] (''Jamaa-el-Jedid'' الجامع الجديد), dating from the 17th century, is in the form of a [[Greek cross]], surmounted by a large white cupola, with four small cupolas at the corners. The minaret is {{convert|27|m|0}} high. The interior resembles that of the Grand Mosque.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=654}}

The church of the Holy Trinity (built in 1870) stands at the southern end of the ''rue d'Isly'' near the site of the demolished Fort Bab Azoun باب عزون. The interior is richly decorated with various coloured marbles. Many of these marbles contain memorial inscriptions relating to the British residents (voluntary and involuntary) of Algiers from the time of John Tipton, the first English consul, in 1580 (NB Some sources give 1585). One tablet records that in 1631 two Algerine pirate crews landed in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], sacked [[Baltimore, County Cork|Baltimore]], and enslaved its inhabitants.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=654}}

[[File:Mosquée Ketchaoua.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Ketchaoua Mosque]]
[[File:Algiers new mosque 1.jpg | thumb|right | Mosque in the City of Algiers.]]

The [[Ketchaoua Mosque]] (''Djamaa Ketchaoua'' جامع كتشاوة), at the foot of the Casbah, was before independence in 1962 the cathedral of St Philippe, itself made in 1845 from a mosque dating from 1612. The principal entrance, reached by a flight of 23 steps, is ornamented with a [[portico]] supported by four black-veined marble columns. The roof of the nave is of [[Moorish Empire|Moorish]] [[plaster]] work. It rests on a series of arcades supported by white marble columns. Several of these columns belonged to the original mosque. In one of the chapels was a tomb containing the bones of [[Geronimo (martyr)|Geronimo]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=654}} The building seems a curious blend of Moorish and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] styles.

Algiers possesses a college with schools of law, medicine, science and letters. The college buildings are large and handsome. The [[Bardo National Museum (Algiers)|Bardo Museum]] holds some of the ancient sculptures and mosaics discovered in Algeria, together with medals and Algerian money.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=654}}

The port of Algiers is sheltered from all winds. There are two harbours, both artificial—the old or northern harbour and the southern or Agha harbour. The northern harbour covers an area of {{convert|95|ha|acre|0}}. An opening in the south [[jetty]] affords an entrance into Agha harbour, constructed in Agha Bay. Agha harbour has also an independent entrance on its southern side. The inner harbour was begun in 1518 by [[Khair-ad-Din Barbarossa]] (see History, below), who, to accommodated his pirate vessels, caused the island on which was Fort Penon to be connected with the mainland by a [[mole (architecture)|mole]]. The lighthouse which occupies the site of [[Fort Penon]] was built in 1544.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=654}}

Algiers was a walled city from the time of the deys until the close of the 19th century. The French, after their occupation of the city (1830), built a [[Defensive wall|rampart]], [[parapet]] and [[ditch (fortification)|ditch]], with two terminal forts, [[Bab Azoun]] باب عزون to the south and [[Bab-el-Oued]] اد to the north. The forts and part of the ramparts were demolished at the beginning of the 20th century, when a line of forts occupying the heights of [[Bouzareah]] بوزريعة (at an elevation of {{convert|396|m|0}} above the sea) took their place.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=654}}

[[Notre Dame d'Afrique]], a church built (1858–1872) in a mixture of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] styles, is conspicuously situated overlooking the sea, on the shoulder of the [[Bouzareah]] hills, {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}}
to the north of the city. Above the altar is a statue of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin]] depicted as a black woman. The church also contains a solid silver statue of the [[archangel Michael]], belonging to the confraternity of [[Naples|Neapolitan]] fishermen.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=655}}

[[Villa Abd-el-Tif]], former residence of the [[dey]], was used during the French period, to accommodate French artists, chiefly painters, and winners of the [[Abd-el-Tif prize]], among whom [[Maurice Boitel]], for a while of two years. Nowadays, Algerian artists are back in the villa's studios.

Mohamed Ben Ali El Abbar, president of the Council of Administration of the Emirate Group EMAAR, presented five "megaprojects" to Algerian President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], during a ceremony which took place Saturday, July 15, in the [[People's Palace (Algiers)|People's Palace]] of Algiers. These projects will transform the city of Algiers and its surroundings by equipping them with a retail area and restoration and leisure facilities.

The first project will concentrate on the reorganization and the development of the infrastructures of the railway station "Aga" located in the downtown area. The ultramodern station intended to accommodate more than 80.000 passengers per day, will become a centre of circulation in the heart of the grid system, surrounded by commercial offices and buildings and hotels intended for travellers in transit. A shopping centre and three high-rise office buildings rising with the top of the commercial zone will accompany the project.

The second project will not relate to the bay of Algiers and aims to revitalize the sea front. The development of the {{convert|44|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} sea front will include marinas, channels, luxury hotels, offices, apartments of great standing, luxury stores and leisure amenities. A crescent-shaped peninsula will be set up on the open sea. The project of the bay of Algiers will also comprise six small islands, of which four of round form, connected to each other by bridges and marinas and will include tourist and residential complexes.
[[File:Alger Tunnel-des-Facultes - Place-Maurice-Audin IMG 0236.JPG|thumb|left|[[Air Algérie]] head office in Place [[Maurice Audin|Audin]] near the [[University of Algiers]], in Alger-Centre]]
The third project will relate to restructuring an area of Algiers, qualified by the originators of the project of "city of wellness". El Abbar indicated to the journalists that the complex would be "agreeable for all those which will want to combine tourism and well-being or tourism and relaxation". The complex will include a university, a research center and a medical centre. It should also include a hospital complex, a care centre, a hotel zone, an urban centre and a thermal spa with villas and apartments. The university will include a medical school and a school for care male nurses which will be able to accommodate 500 students. The university campus will have the possibility of seeing setting up broad ranges of buildings of research laboratories and residences.

Another project relates to technological implantation of a campus in Sidi Abdellah, {{convert|25|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south-east from Algiers. This {{convert|90|ha|acre|0|}} site will include shopping centres, residential zones with high standard apartments and a golf course surrounded by villas and hotels. Two other residential zones, including 1.800 apartments and 40 high standard villas, will be built on the surrounding hills.

The fifth project is that of the tourist complex Colonel Abbès, which will be located {{convert|25|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} west from Algiers. This complex will include several retail zones, meeting places, and residential zones composed of apartments and villas with views of the sea.<ref>{{cite book |title=The report 2008 : Algeria. |publisher=Oxford Business Group |isbn=978-1-902339-09-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPz9FHXJVLUC&q=Colonel+Abbes++tourist+complex&pg=PA32 |language=en |year=2008 |access-date=2020-10-01 |archive-date=2024-05-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240521144613/https://books.google.com/books?id=zPz9FHXJVLUC&q=Colonel+Abbes++tourist+complex&pg=PA32#v=snippet&q=Colonel%20Abbes%20%20tourist%20complex&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref>
