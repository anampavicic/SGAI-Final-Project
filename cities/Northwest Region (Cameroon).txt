The '''Northwest Region''', or '''North-West Region''' ({{Langx|fr|link=no|Région du Nord-Ouest}}) is a [[Regions of Cameroon|region]] with [[Autonomous region|special status]] in [[Cameroon]]. Its capital is [[Bamenda]]. The Northwest Region was part of the [[Southern Cameroons]], found in the western highlands of Cameroon. It is bordered to the southwest by the [[Southwest Region (Cameroon)|Southwest Region]], to the south by the [[West Region (Cameroon)|West Region]], to the east by the [[Adamawa Region]], and to the north by [[Nigeria]]. Various [[Ambazonia]]n nationalist and separatist factions regard the region as being distinct as a [[polity]] from Cameroon.<ref>Tatah-Mentan, I., and F. Achankeng. "Stopping war before it starts: testing preventive diplomacy in the selfdetermination case of British Southern Cameroons (aka Ambazonia)." British Southern Cameroons: Nationalism & Conflict in Postcolonial Africa (2014): 127-170.</ref>

In 1919, the Northwest Region became solely administered by the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>Identity Politics in Colonial Africa: Fulani Migrations and Land Conflict'', Taylor & Francis, UK, 2016, p. 20</ref> In 1961, the region joined the [[Cameroon]].<ref>Emmanuel Mbah, ''Environment and Identity Politics in Colonial Africa: Fulani Migrations and Land Conflict'', Taylor & Francis, UK, 2016, p. 21</ref> [[Ambazonia]]n separatists regard both the North-West and South-West regions as being constituent components of their envisaged breakaway state.<ref>Adepoju, Paul. "World Report Hospital attack in anglophone Cameroon kills four patients." (2019).</ref>

==History==
The origins of the region are linked to the settlement of the [[Tikar people|Tikar]] people who joined the [[Kingdom of Bamum|Bamoun Kingdom]], in the 1700s.<ref>Toyin Falola, Daniel Jean-Jacques, ' 'Africa: An Encyclopedia of Culture and Society [3 volumes]: An Encyclopedia of Culture and Society', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2015, p. 142</ref> In 1884, the region was colonized by [[Germany]] under the regime of the [[protectorate]] until 1916 when it became a [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] administered jointly by the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[France]].<ref>Emmanuel Mbah, ''Environment and Identity Politics in Colonial Africa: Fulani Migrations and Land Conflict'', Taylor & Francis, UK, 2016, p. 20</ref> In 1919, the administration of the North West region, as part of [[Southern Cameroons]] became solely British. In 1961, the region joined [[Cameroon]] as part of the federated state of [[West Cameroon]], under the [[1961 British Cameroons referendum]].<ref>Emmanuel Mbah, ''Environment and Identity Politics in Colonial Africa: Fulani Migrations and Land Conflict'', Taylor & Francis, UK, 2016, p. 21</ref>

At the end of 2017, an [[Ambazonia|Ambazonian separatist]] movement in the two English-speaking regions of North West and [[Southwest Region (Cameroon)|South West]] began a wave of violence affecting soldiers, police, business leaders and workers. Separatist activists are trying in particular to prevent children from returning to school. Between 2016 and 2019, sepretists reportedly ransacked, destroyed or burned down more than 174 schools.<ref>Philippe Karsenty, [https://www.causeur.fr/rentree-scolaire-cameroun-ambazoniens-terrorisme-165174 in Cameroon], causeur.fr, September 2, 2019</ref>

==Administration==
[[File:Northwest Cameroon divisions.png|thumb|left|250px|Divisions of Northwest Cameroon]]
The Northwest Region (known before 2008 as the Northwest Province) is the third most populated province in Cameroon. It has one major metropolitan city, [[Bamenda]], with several other smaller towns such as [[Wum]], [[Kumbo]], [[Mbengwi]], [[Ndop, Cameroon|Ndop]], [[Nkambé]], [[Batibo]], [[Bambui]], Bafut and [[Oshie, Cameroon|Oshie]]. The province saw an increase in its population from approximately 1.2 million in 1987 to 1.8 million in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |last=Government of Cameroon |url=http://www.statistics-cameroon.org/downloads/La_population_du_Cameroun_2010.pdf |title=La Population du Cameroun 2010 |language=fr |access-date=17 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528185054/http://www.statistics-cameroon.org/downloads/La_population_du_Cameroun_2010.pdf |archive-date=28 May 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The population density of 99.12 people per square kilometer is higher than the national average of 22.6. The provincial urban growth rate is 7.95%, higher than the national average of 5.6%, while the rural growth rate, at 1.16%, is equal to the national rate. In 2001, according to the Statistical Provincial Services of the North-West Province, the population of the province is young, with over 62% of its residents being less than 20 years old. Therefore, the dependency rate in the province is high, particularly in the rural areas.

Like other regions in Cameroon, the Northwest Region is made up of administrative divisions. The province was created in 1972 with five divisions or [[Departments of Cameroon|departments]]: [[Bui (Cameroon department)|Bui]], [[Donga-Mantung]], [[Menchum]], [[Mezam]], and [[Momo (department)|Momo]]. Today, it has seven divisions, the additions being [[Boyo (department)|Boyo]], which was carved out of the Menchum division, and [[Ngo-Ketunjia]] or Ngoketunjia, split off from the Mezam division. Each division is further subdivided, with thirty-one total subdivisions in the Northwest Province. The basic unit of local government is the council, and there are thirty-two councils in the region.

=== Politics ===
The Northwest is a stronghold of the [[Social Democratic Front (Cameroon)|Social Democratic Front]] (SDF) which is one of the main opposition parties of Cameroon. Some Northwesterners feel completely marginalized by the government. There is also a secessionist movement, the SCNC ([[Southern Cameroons National Council]]) whose goal is to secede from Cameroon and form a republic consisting of the English-speaking regions.{{clarify|date=July 2020|Reason=There has been no mention of English speaking in the article so far, infact the previous section mentions lots of other languages - why is English so imporant here?}} Much of the SCNC's influence exists in the Northwest. In 2008, the President of the Republic of Cameroon, [[Paul Biya]], signed decrees abolishing "Provinces" and replacing them with "Regions". The Northwest Province subsequently became the Northwest Region. 

===Special status===
As part of the [[Major National Dialogue]], the region was given a "special status" in December 2019, granting additional rights and responsibilities in relation to economic, health, social, educational, sports and cultural development.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cameroon grants special status to Anglophone regions |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/world/cameroon-grants-special-status-to-anglophone-regions-idUSKBN1YO24I/ |access-date=2024-11-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-12-21 |title=Cameroon MPs Approve Law Giving Special Status to English-Speaking Regions |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/africa_cameroon-mps-approve-law-giving-special-status-english-speaking-regions/6181455.html |access-date=2024-11-06 |website=Voice of America |language=en}}</ref> Under the special status the region has a bicameral Regional Assembly, made up of a 20-member House of Chiefs composed of traditional leaders and a 70-member House of Divisional Representatives nominated by municipal councils.

[[File:InstrumentistesNordOuest.jpg|thumb|Drums and xylophones are part of the traditional music of the Northwest.]]
The Northwest Region has many ethnic groups, including immigrants from other regions and countries.  Nigeria is well represented, as it borders the region to both the north and the northwest.  The native population comprises a variety of ethnic and linguistic groups. The main ethnic groups are of Tikar origin: [[Tikar language|Tikari]], [[Widikum people|Widikum]], [[Fulani]], and [[Batibo|Moghamo]]. The most widely spoken languages in the province include [[Mungaka]], [[Limbum]], Yamba, spoken by the Yamba people also of the Donga Mantung Division; Bafmen, [[Oku, Cameroon|Oku]], [[Lamnso]], Ngemba, [[Cameroonian Pidgin English|Pidgin English]], [[Balikumbat]], Papiakum, [[Meta' language|Moghamo]], and [[Kom language (Cameroon)|Nkom]]. During the colonial period, administrative boundaries were created which cut across ethnic groups and cultures. As a result, parts of some ethnic groups now lie in different divisions and provinces, which is believed to have led to several land conflicts.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In the provinces, the social organization recognizes a chief as its head, also called the ''Fon''. The Fons, who in their tribal area may be more influential than the official administrative authorities, are considered the living representative of the tribal ancestors.

==Natural attractions==
[[File:NW Cameroon.svg|thumb|Rivers of the NW Region]]
The Northwest region has unique attractions, including the second highest mountain in [[West Africa]], [[Mount Oku]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}} It is home to birds such as the [[Bannerman's turaco]], which is unique to this region. There are also many crater lakes such as [[Lake Oku]], [[Lake Awing]], and [[Lake Nyos]]. The largest remaining mountain forest in the Northwest Region is the [[Kilum-Ijim Forest]]. [[Menchum Falls]], and [[Abbi Falls]] in the [[Mbengwi Division]], are also located here.<gallery>
