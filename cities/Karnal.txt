=== Ancient ===
At the end of 6th century A.D., the area was under the rule of the [[Vardhanas]] of [[Thanesar]].<ref>{{cite book |author=D. C. Ganguly |chapter=Western India in the Sixth Century A.D.|editor=R. C.

The region was under [[Kannauj|Kanauji]] rule under the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] Emperors of Bengal from 770 to 810 AD. The authority of [[Mihira Bhoja]], the [[Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty|Pratihara]] ruler of Kanauj from 836 to 885 AD, penetrated as far as Pehowa, including Karnal.<ref name=history/>

=== Medieval ===
The [[Tomara dynasty|Tomaras]], established themselves as rulers of this region in the middle of the 9th century.<ref name=history>{{cite book |author=H. A.

One of the Tomara rulers, [[Anangpal Tomar]], found the city of Delhi and made it his capital, with the area of Karnal and modern-day Haryana being under his realm. The Tomaras came into conflict with the [[Chahamanas of Shakambhari|Chauhans of Ajmer]], but continued to rule the Haryana country until the middle of 12th century when they were overthrown by the Chaha mana [[Vigraharaja IV|Vighnaraja IV]].<ref>{{cite book |author=R.

The region then came under [[Ghurid]] rule after the [[Second Battle of Tarain]] when [[Muhammad Ghori]] captured the area. It remained under the [[Delhi Sultanate]] until 1526.{{fact|date=July 2024}}

In 1526 at the [[First Battle of Panipat]], Mughal emperor [[Babur]] defeated the Sultan of [[Delhi]], [[Ibrahim Lodi]], and captured parts of North India, along with Delhi and Panipat. He then established the [[Mughal Empire]] in North India.{{fact|date=July 2024}}

Karnal is listed in the Mughal [[Ain-i-Akbari]] as a [[pargana]] under Delhi [[sarkar (administrative division)|sarkar]], producing a revenue of 5,678,242 [[dam (Indian coin)|dam]]s for the imperial treasury and supplying a force of 800 infantry and 50 cavalry.<ref name="Ain-i-Akbari">{{cite book |last1=Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak |last2=Jarrett |first2=Henry Sullivan (translator) |title=The Ain-i-Akbari |date=1891 |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bengal |location=Calcutta |page=286 |url=https://archive.org/details/ainiakbarivolum00mubgoog |access-date=21 January 2021}}</ref>

[[File:The Daria-e Noor (Sea of Light) Diamond from the collection of the national jewels of Iran at Central Bank of Islamic Republic of Iran.jpg|175px|thumb|[[Daria-i-Noor]] diamond was seized by Persia's Nader Shah from the Mughal dynasty following the Battle of Karnal and subsequent sack of Delhi (1739)]]
In A.D. 1739, [[Nader Shah|Nader Shah of Persia]] [[Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire|invaded the Mughal empire]] and Karnal was the scene of the famed [[Battle of Karnal]], in which Nader Shah decisively defeated the Mughal Emperor, [[Muhammad Shah]].<ref name="Shah">[[Michael Axworthy|Axworthy, Michael]] (2009)</ref> Muhammad Shah along with an enormous army occupied a strongly fortified camp at Karnal, but he yielded to the invader as his supplies were cut off from the open country by Shah and was starved into submission.<ref name="Shah" /> The tactical defeat drastically weakened the [[Mughal Empire]], while the [[Afsharid Empire|Persian Empire]] prospered and subsequently hastened the establishment of the [[British Empire]] in India. The region then came under [[Durrani Empire|Afghan]] rule. On 24 Feb1739, the Iranian ruler Nadir Shah attacked India. Rao Bal Kishan, with his army and with the forces of Delhi, fought Nadir Shah. His army included 5000 infantry and 2000 cavalry. In February 1739, Nader Shah captured Sirhind and moved towards the field of Karnal, a battle destined to be fateful to the Mughal rulers. Every year on 24 Feb, Rao Bal Kishan Shaurya Diwas celebrated in Rewari.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kYsMAQAAMAAJ&q=rao+bal+kishan |title=Haryana State Gazetteer |date=2001 |publisher=Haryana Gazetteers Organisation, Revenue Department |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title= |url=https://www.bhaskar.com/local/haryana/rohtak/rewari/news/martyrs-day-of-veer-amar-shaheed-rao-balkishan-celebrated-in-nangal-pathani-128254998.html}}</ref>

[[Sikh history|Sikhs]] appeared on the scene in the 18th century. The importance of Karnal grew in the time of Raja Gajpat Singh of [[Jind State]] who after its capture in A.D. 1763 built the boundary wall and a fort and under whose rule the town increased considerably in size.<ref>{{cite book |author=D.
