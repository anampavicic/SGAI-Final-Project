==History==
===Etymology===
Des Moines takes its name from Fort Des Moines (1843–46), which was named for the [[Des Moines River]]. This was adopted from the name given by [[French colonization of the Americas|French colonists]]. ''Des Moines'' ({{IPA|fr|de mwan|pron|DesMoines1.ogg}}; formerly {{IPA|fr|de mwɛn|}}) translates literally to either "from the monks" or "of the monks".

One popular interpretation of "Des Moines" concludes that it refers to a group of French [[Trappists|Trappist monks]], who in the 17th century lived in huts built on top of what is now known as the ancient [[Monks Mound]] at [[Cahokia]], the major center of [[Mississippian culture]], which developed in what is present-day Illinois, east of the Mississippi River and the city of [[St. Louis]]. This was some {{convert|200|mi|km}} from the Des Moines River.<ref>"[http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030914/ENT/70323017 Defining 'Des Moines']. {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120723212014/http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030914/ENT/70323017 |date=July 23, 2012 }}".

===Prehistoric inhabitants of early Des Moines===
[[File:Indians of Des Moines.png|thumb|left|Map of prehistoric and historic American Indian sites in downtown Des Moines<ref>Modified from ''Newsletter of the [[Iowa Archeological Society]]'' 58(1):8</ref>]]
Based on archaeological evidence, the junction of the [[Des Moines River|Des Moines]] and [[Raccoon River]]s has attracted humans for at least 7,000 years. Several prehistoric occupation areas have been identified by archaeologists in [[downtown Des Moines]]. Discovered in December 2010, the "[[Palace Site|Palace]]" is an expansive 7,000-year-old site found during excavations prior to construction of the new wastewater treatment plant in southeast Des Moines. It contains well-preserved house deposits and numerous graves. More than 6,000 artifacts were found at this site. State of Iowa archaeologist John Doershuk was assisted by [[University of Iowa]] archaeologists at this dig.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Heldt, Diane |date=August 18, 2011 |title=UI archaeologists find 7,000-year-old site in Des Moines: More than 6,000 artifacts were found |work=The Gazette |location=Cedar Rapids, Iowa |url=http://thegazette.com/2011/08/18/ui-archaeologists-find-7000-year-old-site-in-des-moines/ |url-status=live |access-date=October 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925095341/http://thegazette.com/2011/08/18/ui-archaeologists-find-7000-year-old-site-in-des-moines/ |archive-date=September 25, 2011}}</ref>

At least three Late Prehistoric villages, dating from about AD 1300 to 1700, stood in or near what developed later as downtown Des Moines. In addition, 15 to 18 prehistoric [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] mounds were observed in the area by early settlers. All have been destroyed during development of the city.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Schoen, Christopher M. |year=2005 |title=A Point of Land and Prehistoric Peoples |journal=Iowa Heritage Illustrated |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=8–9 |doi=10.17077/1088-5943.1178 |doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name="DMIndians">{{Cite journal |last=Whittaker |first=William E. |year=2008 |title=Prehistoric and Historic Indians in Downtown Des Moines |journal=Newsletter of the Iowa Archeological Society |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=8–10}}</ref>

===Origin of Fort Des Moines===
{{For timeline}}
Des Moines traces its origins to May 1843, when Captain [[James Allen (Army engineer)|James Allen]] supervised the construction of a fort on the site where the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers merge. Allen wanted to use the name Fort Raccoon; however, the [[U.S. War Department]] preferred Fort Des Moines. The fort was built to control the [[Sauk people|Sauk]] and [[Meskwaki]]  peoples, whom the government had moved to the area from their traditional lands in eastern Iowa. The fort was abandoned in 1846 after the Sauk and Meskwaki were removed from the state and shifted to the Indian Territory.<ref name="Forts">{{Cite book |last1=Schoen |first1=Christopher M. |url=http://uipress.uiowa.edu/books/2009-fall/whittaker.htm |title=Frontier Forts of Iowa: Indians, Traders, and Soldiers, 1682–1862 |last2=W.E.

The Sauk and Meskwaki did not fare well in Des Moines. The illegal whiskey trade, combined with the destruction of traditional lifeways, led to severe problems for their society. One newspaper reported:
<blockquote>"It is a fact that the location of Fort Des Moines among the Sac and Fox Indians (under its present commander) for the last two years, had corrupted them more and lowered them deeper in the scale of vice and degradation, than all their intercourse with the whites for the ten years previous".<ref name="Forts" /></blockquote>After official [[Indian Removal|removal]], the Meskwaki continued to return to Des Moines until around 1857.<ref name="DMIndians" />

Archaeological excavations have shown that many fort-related features survived under what is now [[Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway (Des Moines)|Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway]] and First Street.<ref name="Forts" /><ref>Mather, David and Ginalie Swaim (2005) "The Heart of the Best Part: Fort Des Moines No. 2 and the Archaeology of a City", ''Iowa Heritage Illustrated'' 86(1):12–21.</ref> Soldiers stationed at Fort Des Moines opened the first coal mines in the area, mining coal from the riverbank for the fort's blacksmith.<ref>James H.

===Early settlement===

[[File:Flood at Fort Des Moines in 1851 - History of Iowa.jpg|thumb|Flood of Des Moines, 1851]]

Settlers occupied the abandoned fort and nearby areas. On May 25, 1846, the state legislature designated Fort Des Moines as the seat of Polk County. Arozina Perkins, a school teacher who spent the winter of 1850–1851 in the town of Fort Des Moines, was not favorably impressed:

<blockquote>This is one of the strangest looking "cities" I ever saw... This town is at the juncture of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers. It is mostly a level prairie with a few swells or hills around it. We have a court house of "brick" and one church, a plain, framed building belonging to the Methodists. There are two taverns here, one of which has a most important little bell that rings together some fifty boarders. I cannot tell you how many dwellings there are, for I have not counted them; some are of logs, some of brick, some framed, and some are the remains of the old [[dragoon]] houses... The people support two papers and there are several dry goods shops. I have been into but four of them... Society is as varied as the buildings are. There are people from nearly every state, and Dutch, Swedes, etc.<ref>Perkins, Arozina, 1851 letter in: (1984) "Teaching in Fort Des Moines, Iowa: November 13, 1850 to March 21, 1851." In ''Women Teachers on the Frontier,'' edited by P. W. Kaufman, pp. 126–143. Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut.</ref></blockquote>

In May 1851, much of the town was destroyed during the [[Flood of 1851]]. "The Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers rose to an unprecedented height, inundating the entire country east of the Des Moines River. Crops were utterly destroyed, houses and fences swept away."<ref>Mills and Company (1866) ''Des Moines City Directory and Business Guide.'' Des Moines, Iowa: Mills and Company, p. 6. Microfilm, State Historical Society Library, Iowa City.</ref> The city started to rebuild from scratch.

===Era of growth===
On September 22, 1851, Des Moines was incorporated as a city; the charter was approved by voters on October 18. In 1857, the name "Fort Des Moines" was shortened to "Des Moines", and it was designated as the second state capital, previously at [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]]. Growth was slow during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] period, but the city exploded in size and importance after a railroad link was completed in 1866.<ref>Brigham, Johnson (1911) ''Des Moines: The Pioneer of Municipal Progress and Reform of the Middle West.'' Volume 1. Chicago: S. J. Clarke</ref>

In 1864, the Des Moines Coal Company was organized to begin the first systematic mining in the region. Its first mine, north of town on the river's west side, was exhausted by 1873. The Black Diamond mine, near the south end of the West Seventh Street Bridge, sank a {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=on}} [[shaft mining|mine shaft]] to reach a {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-thick}} coal bed.

At the turn of the 20th century, encouraged by the Civic Committee of the [[Des Moines Women's Club]], Des Moines undertook a "[[City Beautiful]]" project in which large [[Beaux Arts (architecture)|Beaux Arts]] public buildings and fountains were constructed along the Des Moines River. The former [[Old Downtown Des Moines Library|Des Moines Public Library building]] (now the home of the [[World Food Prize]]); the United States [[U.S. Post Office (Des Moines, Iowa)|central Post Office]], built by the federal government (now the Polk County Administrative Building, with a newer addition); and the [[Des Moines City Hall|City Hall]] are surviving examples of the 1900–1910 buildings. They form the [[Civic Center Historic District (Des Moines, Iowa)|Civic Center Historic District]].

The ornate riverfront balustrades that line the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers were built by the federal [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] in the mid-1930s, during the [[Great Depression]] under Democratic President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], as a project to provide local employment and improve infrastructure. The ornamental fountains that stood along the riverbank were buried in the 1950s when the city began a postindustrial decline that lasted until the late 1980s.<ref>Dahl, Orin L.

In 1907, the city adopted a [[city commission government]] known as the Des Moines Plan, comprising an elected mayor and four commissioners, all elected [[at-large]], who were responsible for public works, public property, public safety, and finance. Considered progressive at the time, it diluted the votes of ethnic and national minorities, who generally could not command a majority to elect a candidate of their choice.

That form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a [[council-manager]] government, with the council members elected at-large. In 1967, the city changed its government to elect four of the seven city council members from [[single-member district]]s or wards, rather than at-large. This enabled a broader representation of voters. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960), as highway construction led to new residential construction outside the city. The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009.<ref name="citypop">{{Cite web |title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Incorporated Places in Iowa: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2009 |url=https://www.census.gov/popest/cities/tables/SUB-EST2009-04-19.xls |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628184052/http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/tables/SUB-EST2009-04-19.xls |archive-date=June 28, 2011 |access-date=June 30, 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |format=XLS |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The growth of the outlying suburbs has continued, and the overall metropolitan-area population is over 700,000 today.

During the [[Great Flood of 1993]], heavy rains throughout June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to rise above flood stage levels. The Des Moines Water Works was submerged by floodwaters during the early morning hours of July 11, 1993, leaving an estimated 250,000 people without running water for 12 days and without drinking water for 20 days. Des Moines suffered major flooding again in June 2008 with a major [[levee]] breach.<ref>{{Cite news |date=June 14, 2008 |title=Flood-Ravaged Iowa Scrambles to Mend Levees, Protect Water Supplies and Salvage Homes |publisher=Fox News Channel |url=https://www.foxnews.com/story/flood-ravaged-iowa-scrambles-to-mend-levees-protect-water-supplies-and-salvage-homes |url-status=live |access-date=September 12, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917161044/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,367004,00.html |archive-date=September 17, 2008 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Des Moines River is controlled upstream by [[Saylorville Lake|Saylorville Reservoir]]. In both 1993 and 2008, the flooding river overtopped the reservoir spillway.

Today, Des Moines is a member of [[ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA]]. Through ICLEI, Des Moines has implemented "The Tomorrow Plan", a regional plan focused on developing central Iowa in a sustainable fashion, centrally-planned growth, and resource consumption to manage the local population.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2014-12-22 |title=The Tomorrow Plan |url=https://dmampo.org/the-tomorrow-plan/ |access-date=2020-04-21 |website=Des Moines Area MPO |language=en-US}}</ref>

[[File:DesMoinesIowaSkyline.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Downtown Des Moines night skyline looking northwest]]
The skyline of Des Moines changed in the 1970s and the 1980s, when several new skyscrapers were built. Additional skyscrapers were built in the 1990s, including Iowa's tallest. Before then, the 19-story [[Equitable Building (Des Moines)|Equitable Building]], from 1924, was the tallest building in the city and the tallest building in Iowa. The 25-story [[Financial Center]] was completed in 1973 and the 36-story [[Ruan Center]] was completed in 1974. They were later joined by the 33-story [[Des Moines Marriott Hotel]] (1981), the 25-story [[HUB Tower]] and 25-story [[Plaza Building (Des Moines, Iowa)|Plaza Building]] (1985). Iowa's tallest building, [[Principal Financial Group]]'s 45-story tower at [[801 Grand]] was built in 1991, and the 19-story [[EMC Insurance Building]] was erected in 1997.

During this time period, the [[Civic Center of Greater Des Moines]] (1979) was developed; it hosts Broadway shows and special events. Also constructed were the [[Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden]] (1979), a large city botanical garden/greenhouse on the east side of the river; the [[Iowa Events Center#Polk County Convention Complex|Polk County Convention Complex]] (1985), and the State of Iowa Historical Museum (1987). The Des Moines [[skyway|skywalk]] also began to take shape during the 1980s. The skywalk system is {{convert|4|mi}} long and connects many downtown buildings.<ref>[http://www.seedesmoines.com/get_around/skywalks.php Greater Des Moines Convention and Visitors Bureau] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605120927/http://www.seedesmoines.com/get_around/skywalks.php |date=June 5, 2010 }}.

In the early 21st century, the city has had more major construction in the downtown area. The new [[Science Center of Iowa]] and Blank IMAX Dome Theater and the [[Iowa Events Center]] opened in 2005. The new central branch of the Des Moines Public Library, designed by renowned architect [[David Chipperfield]] of London, opened on April 8, 2006.

The [[World Food Prize]] Foundation, which is based in Des Moines, completed adaptation and restoration of the [[Public Library of Des Moines|former Des Moines Public Library]] building in October 2011. The former library now serves as the home and headquarters of the [[Norman Borlaug]]/World Food Prize Hall of Laureates.

===Climate===
At the center of North America and far removed from large bodies of water, the Des Moines area has a hot summer type [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfa''), with warm to hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters. Summer temperatures can often climb into the {{convert|90|°F|0}} range, occasionally reaching {{convert|100|°F|0}}. Humidity can be high in spring and summer, with frequent afternoon [[thunderstorm]]s. Fall brings pleasant temperatures and colorful [[fall foliage]]. Winters vary from moderately cold to bitterly cold, with low temperatures venturing below {{convert|0|°F}} quite often. Snowfall averages {{convert|36.5|in|cm|0}} per season, and annual precipitation averages {{convert|36.55|in|mm|0}}, with a peak in the warmer months. Winters are slightly colder than [[Chicago]], but still warmer than [[Minneapolis]], with summer temperatures being very similar between the [[Upper Midwest]] metropolitan areas.

==Parks and recreation==
[[File:Kruidenier Trail Bridge at night.jpg|thumb|upright|Kruidenier Trail bridge across Gray's Lake]]
Des Moines has 76 city parks and three golf courses, as well as three family aquatic centers, five community centers and three swimming pools. The city has {{convert|45|mi|km}} of trails. The first major park was Greenwood Park. The park commissioners purchased the land on April 21, 1894.

The [[Principal Riverwalk]] is a riverwalk park district being constructed along the banks of the Des Moines River in the downtown. Primarily funded by the [[Principal Financial Group]], the Riverwalk is a multi-year jointly funded project also funded by the city and state. Upon completion, it will feature a {{convert|1.2|mi|km|adj=on}} recreational trail connecting the east and west sides of downtown via two pedestrian bridges. A landscaped promenade along the street level is planned. The Riverwalk includes the downtown Brenton Skating Plaza, open from November through March.

Gray's Lake, part of the {{convert|167|acres|0|abbr=on}} of [[Gray's Lake Park]], features a boat rental facility, fishing pier, floating boardwalks, and a park resource center. Located just south of the downtown, the centerpiece of the park is a lighted {{convert|1.9|mi|km|adj=on}} Kruidenier Trail, encircling it entirely.

From [[downtown Des Moines]] primarily along the east bank of the Des Moines River, the Neil Smith and John Pat Dorrian Trails are {{convert|28.2|mi|km|adj=on}} paved recreational trails that connect Gray's Lake northward to the east shore of [[Saylorville Lake]], [[Big Creek Lake (Iowa)|Big Creek State Park]], and the recreational trails of [[Ankeny, Iowa|Ankeny]] including the [[High Trestle Trail]].<ref name="NorthSouthTrails">{{Cite web |title=Neil Smith and John Pat Dorrain Trails |url=http://www.inhf.org//trails/neal-smith-john-pat-dorrian.cfm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503145431/http://www.inhf.org/trails/neal-smith-john-pat-dorrian.cfm |archive-date=May 3, 2013 |access-date=April 28, 2013 |website=Iowa Trails |publisher=Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation}}</ref> These trails are near several recreational facilities including the Pete Crivaro Park, [[Principal Park]], the Principal Riverwalk, the [[Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden]], Union Park and its Heritage Carousel of Des Moines, Birdland Park and the Birdland Marina/Boatramp on the [[Des Moines River]], Riverview Park, McHenry Park, and River Drive Park.<ref name="Parks">{{Cite web |title=Parks and Recreation |url=http://www.dmgov.org/Departments/Parks/Pages/Parks.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429172024/http://www.dmgov.org/Departments/Parks/Pages/Parks.aspx |archive-date=April 29, 2013 |access-date=April 28, 2013 |publisher=City of Des Moines}}</ref> Although outside of Des Moines, Jester Park has {{convert|1834|acres|0|abbr=on}} of land along the western shore of Saylorville Lake and can be reached from the Neil Smith Trail over the Saylorville Dam.

Just west of Gray's Lake are the {{convert|1500|acre|ha|0}} of the Des Moines [[Water Works Park (Des Moines)|Water Works Park]]. The Water Works Park is along the banks of the [[Raccoon River]] immediately upstream from where the Raccoon River empties into the Des Moines River. The Des Moines Water Works Facility, which obtains the city's drinking water from the Raccoon River, is entirely within the Water Works Park. A bridge in the park crosses the Raccoon River. The Water Works Park recreational trails link to downtown Des Moines by travelling past Gray's Lake and back across the Raccoon River via either along the Meredith Trail near Principal Park, or along the Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway. The Water Works Park trails connect westward to [[West Des Moines, Iowa|Valley Junction]] and the [[Clive Greenbelt Trail#Connections to other trails|recreational trails]] of the western suburbs: [[Windsor Heights, Iowa|Windsor Heights]], [[Urbandale, Iowa|Urbandale]], [[Clive, Iowa|Clive]], and [[Waukee, Iowa|Waukee]].

A plan to merge the governments of Des Moines and Polk County was rejected by voters during the November 2, 2004, election. The [[consolidated city-county]] government would have had a full-time mayor and a 15-member council that would have been divided among the city and its suburbs. Each suburb would still have retained its individual government but with the option to join the consolidated government at any time. Although a full merger was soundly rejected, several city and county departments and programs have been consolidated.
