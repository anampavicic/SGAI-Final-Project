'''Breda''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|eɪ|d|ə}} {{respell|BRAY|də}}, {{IPAc-en|alsoUK|ˈ|b|r|iː|d|ə}} {{respell|BREE|də}}, {{IPAc-en|US|b|r|eɪ|ˈ|d|ɑː}} {{respell|bray|DAH}}, {{IPA|nl|breːˈdaː|lang|nl-Breda.ogg}}) is a [[List of cities in the Netherlands by province|city]] and [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] in the southern part of the [[Netherlands]], located in the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[North Brabant]]. The name derived from ''brede Aa'' ('wide Aa' or 'broad Aa') and refers to the confluence of the rivers [[Mark (Dintel)|Mark]] and [[Aa of Weerijs|Aa]].<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Breda}}</ref> Breda has 
185,072 inhabitants on 13 September 2022 and is part of the [[Brabantse Stedenrij]]; it is the ninth largest city/municipality in the country, and the third largest in North Brabant after [[Eindhoven]] and [[Tilburg]]. It is equidistant from [[Rotterdam]] and [[Antwerp]].

As a [[Defensive wall|fortified city]], it was of strategic military and political significance. Although a direct [[fiefdom]] of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], the city obtained a [[City rights in the Low Countries|municipal charter]]; the acquisition of Breda, through marriage, by the [[House of Orange-Nassau|House of Nassau]] ensured that Breda would be at the centre of political and social life in the [[Low Countries]]. Breda had a population of {{formatnum:{{Dutch municipality population|Breda}}}} in {{YEAR|{{Dutch municipality population|popbaseyear}}}}; the metropolitan area had a population of {{formatnum:{{Dutch municipality population urbanmetro|Breda Metro}}}}.

In the 11th century, Breda was a direct [[Fiefdom|fief]] of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]],<ref name=EB1911/> its earliest known lord being [[Henry of Brunesheim]] (1080–1125). The city of Breda obtained a [[City rights in the Low Countries|municipal charter]] in 1252. After that Breda had the rights to build fortifications. The city constructed brick walls and Roman-style gates.

In 1327, [[Adelheid of Gaveren]] sold Breda to Duke [[John III, Duke of Brabant|Johannes III]] of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]]. In 1350, the fief was resold to [[Johannes II of Wassenaar]] (d. 1377). In 1403, the heiress of his line, [[Johanna of Polanen]] (1392–1445), married [[Engelbert I of Nassau]] (1370–1442; his [[sarcophagus]] is in the [[Grote Kerk (Breda)|Grote Kerk]] in Breda). Through her, the city came into the possession of the [[House of Orange-Nassau|House of Nassau]], where it remained until 1795, passing to [[William the Silent|William I of Orange]] (1533–1584), [[stadtholder]] of [[Holland]], [[Zeeland]], and [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] and leader of the [[Dutch Revolt|Dutch revolt]]. Thus, the [[Barony of Breda|baron of Breda]] was also [[County of Nassau|Count of Nassau]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Principality of Orange|Prince of Orange]], and (the main) [[stadtholder]] in the [[Dutch Republic]] (from 1572 to 1650, 1672–1702, 1747–1795). Breda remained part of the barony of Breda until it was captured by [[French Revolutionary Army|French revolutionary forces]] in 1795.<ref>The [[Prince of Orange]] and subsequently [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|King or Queen of the Netherlands]] continued to use the title; today [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]] uses the title Baron of Breda.</ref>

===Residence city===

[[File:Velazquez-The Surrender of Breda.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Surrender of Breda]],'' by [[Diego Velázquez]].]]

The acquisition of the city by the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] marked its emergence as a ''residentiestad'' (residence city). The presence of the Orange-Nassau family attracted other nobles, who built palatial residences in the old quarters of the city. The most impressive one, built by the Italian architect [[Tommaso Vincidor|Thomas Vincidor de Bologna]] for the first Dutch prince, was the first [[Renaissance architecture|renaissance-style]] palace built north of the Alps. In the 15th century the city's physical, economic and strategic importance expanded rapidly. A great church was built in [[Brabantine Gothic]] style with an elegant {{convert|97|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-high}} tower, called ''Grote Kerk'' (main church) or also ''Onze Lieve Vrouwe Kerk'' (Church of Our Lady). In 1534 [[Henry III of Nassau-Breda]] rebuilt the modest medieval fortifications in impressive style.

In 1534, a fire destroyed over nine tenths of the city, close to 1300 houses, churches, and chapels, and the town hall. Only 150 houses and the main church remained. In July 1581, during the [[Eighty Years' War]], Breda was captured in a [[Siege of Breda (1581)|surprise attack and siege]] by Spanish troops then under the command of [[Claude de Berlaymont|Claudius van Barlaymont]], whose [[sobriquet]] was Haultpenne. Although the city had surrendered upon the condition that it would not be plundered, the troops vented their fury upon the inhabitants. In the resulting mayhem, known as ''Haultpenne's Fury'', over 500 citizens were killed. In March 1590, Breda fell back into the hands of the Dutch and [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Maurice of Nassau]], when a 68&nbsp;men hand-picked force, concealed under the turf of a peat-boat, had contrived to enter the city in a daring plan devised by [[Adriaen van Bergen]], known as the ruse with [[Siege of Breda (1590)|the Peat Ship of Breda]]. Around 1610 the construction of the Spanish Gate or "Spanjaardsgat" was started as a remembrance to that successful action.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spanjaardsgat|url=http://kasteelvanbreda.nl/Kasteelvanbreda.nl/gebouwen/spanjaardsgat|access-date=22 August 2017|archive-date=22 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822134514/http://kasteelvanbreda.nl/Kasteelvanbreda.nl/gebouwen/spanjaardsgat|url-status=live}}</ref>

After a [[Siege of Breda (1624)|ten-month siege in 1624–25]], the city again surrendered to the Spaniards, now led by [[Ambrogio Spinola, marqués de los Balbases|Spinola]]; the event was immortalized by [[Diego Velázquez]]. In the [[Siege of Breda (1637)|Siege of Breda of 1637]] the city was recaptured by [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange]], after a four-month siege, and in 1648 it was finally ceded to the [[Dutch Republic]] by the [[Peace of Westphalia|Treaty of Westphalia]].

In 1646, Frederick Henry founded the [[Orange College of Breda]], modelled on [[Academy of Saumur|Saumur]], [[University of Geneva|Geneva]], and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], intending it to train young men of good family for the army and the civil service.<ref name=journal>[[Lodewijck Huygens]], ''The English Journal: 1651-1652'', p. 13</ref>

===Stuart exiles===
The exiled Stuart [[Charles II of England]] resided in Breda for a little over a month of his time in exile during the [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] Commonwealth and [[Protectorate]], thanks to the proximity of Charles's sister [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange]], the widow of [[William II, Prince of Orange|Prince William II of Orange]] (died 1650).

Based mostly on suggestions by the Parliamentarian General [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|George Monck]], Charles II's [[Declaration of Breda]] (1660) announced his conditions for accepting the crown of England, which he was to regain a few months later in the year.

===Later history===
[[File:The Polish Army in the North-west Europe Campaign, 1944-1945 KY44011.jpg|thumb|left|[[Polish Armed Forces in the West|Polish soldiers]] welcomed by the residents of Breda, 1944]]

The [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] was signed in the city on 31 July 1667, bringing to an end the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in which the Dutch faced the same Charles II who had been their guest. Between 1746 and 1748 it was the site of the [[Congress of Breda]], a series of talks between Britain and France aimed at bringing an end to the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], which ultimately led to the signing of the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]].

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the city was under [[Germany|German]] occupation for over four years. During [[Operation Pheasant]] Breda was liberated following a successful outflanking manoeuvre planned and performed by forces of [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)|1st Polish Armoured Division]] of [[Stanisław Maczek|General Maczek]] on 28 October 1944. Each year during [[Liberation Day]] festivities, Breda is visited by a large Polish contingent and the city of Breda reserves a special portion of the festivities for the fallen Polish soldiers. A museum and a monument honoring Maczek and the Polish 1st Armoured Division stands in the city center. General Maczek and many soldiers of his division are buried in the nearby [[Polish Armed Forces|Polish military]] cemetery.

Breda was the site of one of the first [[panopticon]] prison establishments, [[Koepelgevangenis (Breda)|Koepelgevangenis]]. This prison housed the only German war criminals ever to be imprisoned in the Netherlands for their [[war crime]]s during the Second World War. Known as "[[The Breda Four]]", or "Vier von Breda", they were [[Willy Lages|Willy Paul Franz Lages]], who was released in 1966 due to serious illness, [[Joseph Kotalla|Joseph Johann Kotalla]], who died in prison in 1979, and [[Ferdinand aus der Fünten]] and Franz Fischer, who were both released in 1989 and died later the same year.

==Economy==
[[File:026 Algemene warenmarkt - market in Grote Markt, Breda, Netherlands.jpg|thumb|The market at Grote Markt]]
Historically, economic activities were mainly industrial. Breda was a center of the food- and drink industry. Companies like [[Hero Group|Hero]] (lemonade), [[Perfetti Van Melle|Van Melle]] ([[Mentos]]), De Faam (liquorice) and Kwatta (chocolate) are famous throughout [[Western Europe]].{{Citeneeded|date=April 2023}} Breda also had a [[sugar]] factory, supplying its best-known products.

Breda formerly housed the largest brewery in the Netherlands ([[Oranjeboom]]). The multinational [[Interbrew]] took over the brewery in 1995 and then closed it in 2004. Production of the ''Breda'' brand was moved to both Bremen and Leuven until 2008, when [[Randalls Brewery]] (in Guernsey) acquired the licence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisguernsey.com/latest/2008/08/27/brew-coup-as-breda-is-made-in-guernsey/ |title=Brew coup as Breda is made in Guernsey « This Is Guernsey |publisher=Thisisguernsey.com |access-date=2013-03-12 |archive-date=2013-03-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330105630/http://www.thisisguernsey.com/latest/2008/08/27/brew-coup-as-breda-is-made-in-guernsey/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Guernsey]] is now the only place in the world where draught Breda is brewed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.randallsbrewery.com/breda.htm |title=Breda |publisher=Randalls Brewery |date=2012-11-22 |access-date=2013-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502111435/http://www.randallsbrewery.com/breda.htm |archive-date=2013-05-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

However, the decline of industrial activity did not harm the city's economy. Nowadays, Breda is a service oriented economy based on business, trade and logistics. A growing number of international companies choose to establish their head office for Benelux operations and manufacturing in Breda. Examples of these companies are [[3M]]<ref>[https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-profiles.3m_nederland_bv.f58acadeca18ebe4fcd1a94b98de264c.html 3M Nederland B.V.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624202736/https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-profiles.3m_nederland_bv.f58acadeca18ebe4fcd1a94b98de264c.html |date=2021-06-24 }} Dun & Bradstreet.

Also, the food industry is still largely represented by companies such as [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]], [[Hero Group]], [[Perfetti Van Melle]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Royal Cosun|nl}}. Furthermore, the city is host to the headquarters of the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]]. Because of its central location between the ports of [[Antwerp]] and [[Rotterdam]], the city also attracts logistics companies such as [[Van Wijngen International]].<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |title=Hazeldonk |url=https://www.bredabusiness.com/werklocaties/hazeldonk |access-date=2024-06-30 |website=Breda Business |language=nl}}</ref> [[Koch Media]] has its Benelux office in Breda.<ref>"[http://www.kochmedia.com/en/company/contact/ Contact] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919210811/http://www.kochmedia.com/en/company/contact/ |date=2016-09-19 }}."

The main shopping areas of Breda are the city centre and the southern part of Breda. Known shopping centres are De Barones and 't Sas. Major shopping streets are the Eindstraat, {{Interlanguage link multi|Ginnekenstraat|nl|3=Ginnekenstraat (Breda)}}, Wilhelminastraat and Ginnekenweg. A market is held on the Grote Markt every Tuesday and Friday from 09:00 to 13:00. A book and antique market is held on Wednesday from 09:00 to 17:00.

The [[Harley Day (Breda)|Harley Dag]] was one of the biggest one-day motorcycle events of Europe, held on the third Sunday of August. The American motorcycle brands [[Harley Davidson]] and [[Indian Motorcycle|Indian]] were the main guests of the day. Other American brands were also welcomed to the city centre. All other brands had to park at a dedicated parking outside the city centre. At the peak over 10,000 motorcycles visited the city and attracted an audience of a 100,000 people. 2010 was the 22nd and last official edition. Due to the large number of people, the city council demanded strict security measurements for the following years. This was the moment that the volunteer organization pulled the plug and cancelled future editions of the event. 
;2011, No(n) Harley Dag
In 2011 not all people heard of the cancelling so around 400 motorcycles and their owners visited the city anyway. Supporters who did know about it came up with the idea of the ‘No(n)-Harley-Dag’.
;2012
Despite the official cancelling, coincidentally several of Breda’s motor tour clubs held their annual tour on the third Sunday of August and drove through the complete Breda region. The tours ended on the Church square next to the [[Grote Kerk (Breda)|Grote Kerk]] in the centre, where, coincidentally, a rockband was playing.

===Roodharigedag===
[[Redhead Day]] (nl; Roodharigedag) is a festival that between 2007 and 2011 took place in Breda during first weekend of September. Since 2019 the festival relocated to [[Tilburg]].

The festival attracts attendance from 20 countries and was free due to sponsorship of the local government. Furthermore, some people referred to Breda as the opposite of burning man. As the festival grew bigger they needed a new spot to host the ever growing event.
