== Etymology ==
There are several theories as to the origin of the name ''Chhattisgarh'', which in ancient times was known as [[Dakshina Kosala]] (South Kosala),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/dakshinakosala|title=Dakshinakosala, Dakshina-kosala, Dakṣiṇakosala: 1 definition|last=www.wisdomlib.org|date=21 May 2017|website=www.wisdomlib.org|access-date=29 December 2019|archive-date=29 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191229121804/https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/dakshinakosala|url-status=live}}</ref> the native place of [[Rama]]'s mother [[Kausalya]].

The most popular theory claims that Chhattisgarh takes its name from the 36 ancient forts (from ''chhattis'' meaning thirty-six and ''garh'' meaning [[fort]]) in the area.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} The old state had 36 demesnes (feudal territories): [[Ratanpur, Chhattisgarh|Ratanpur]], Vijaypur, Kharound, Maro, Kautgarh, [[Nawagarh]], Sondhi, Aukhar, Padarbhatta, Semriya, Champa, Lafa, Chhuri, Kenda, Matin, Aparora, Pendra, Kurkuti-kandri, Raipur, Patan, Simaga, Singarpur, Lavan, Omera, Durg, Saradha, Sirasa, Menhadi, Khallari, Sirpur, Figeswar, Rajim, Singhangarh, Suvarmar, Tenganagarh and Akaltara.<ref>Dr. Bhagvan Singh Verma, ''Chhattisgarh ka Itihas'' (A History of Chhattisgarh&nbsp;– in Hindi), Madhya Pradesh Hindi Granth Academy, Bhopal (M.P.), 4th edition (2003), p.7</ref> However, most historians disagree with this theory as 36 forts have not been found and identified.

According to the opinion of Hiralal, it is said that at one time there were 36 strongholds in this area, that is why its name was Chhattisgarh. But even after the increase in the number of strongholds, there was no change in the name, Chhattisgarh is the [[State of India]] which has been given the status of 'Mahtari' (Mother).{{citation needed|date=June 2023}} There are two regions in India which are named for special reasons – one was '[[Magadha (Mahajanapada)|Magadha]]' which became "[[Bihar]]" due to the abundance of [[Buddhism]] viharas and the other was '[[Dakshina Kosala]]' which became "Chhattisgarh" due to the inclusion of thirty-six strongholds.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

Another view, more popular with experts and historians, is that Chhattisgarh is the corrupted form of ''Chedisgarh'' meaning ''Raj'' or "[[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Empire of the Chedis]]".{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} In ancient times, Chhattisgarh region had been part of the [[Mahameghavahana|Chedi dynasty]] of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]], in modern [[Odisha]]. In the medieval period up to 1803, a major portion of present eastern Chhattisgarh was part of the [[Sambalpur State|Sambalpur Kingdom]] of [[Odisha]].

=== Modern history ===
{{See also|Chhattisgarh Division}}
Chhattisgarh was under [[Maratha Empire|Maratha Rule]] ([[Bhonsles of Nagpur]]) from 1741 to 1845. It came under British rule from 1845 to 1947 as the [[Chhattisgarh Division]] of the [[Central Provinces]]. Raipur gained prominence over the capital Ratanpur with the advent of the British in 1845. In 1905, the [[Sambalpur district]] was transferred to Odisha and the estates of Surguja were transferred from Bengal to Chhattisgarh.

The area constituting the new state merged into Madhya Pradesh on 1 November 1956, under the [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956]], and remained a part of that state for 44 years. Prior to that, the region was part of the [[Central Provinces and Berar]] (CP and Berar) under British rule. Some areas constituting the Chhattisgarh state were [[princely state]]s under [[British rule]], but were later on merged into Madhya Pradesh.<ref>{{cite web|title=State Finance Report - Chapter 4|url=http://cgfinance.nic.in/FSFC/State%20Finance%20Report/English/Chap-4.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502133300/http://cgfinance.nic.in/FSFC/State%20Finance%20Report/English/Chap-4.pdf|archive-date=2 May 2013|access-date=1 April 2012}}</ref>

=== Separation of Chhattisgarh ===
[[File:Secretariat in Naya Raipur.JPG|thumb|Mantralaya in [[Naya Raipur]] ]]
The demand for Chhattisgarh to be a separate state first rose in the 1920s, with similar demands appearing at regular intervals; however, a well-organised movement was never initiated. Several all-party platforms were created and usually resolved around petitions, public meetings, seminars, rallies and strikes.<ref name="Prithak Chhattisgarh">{{cite web|title=Prithak Chhattisgarh|url=http://cg.gov.in/profile/corigin.htm#prathak|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704202817/http://cg.gov.in/profile/corigin.htm|archive-date=4 July 2010|access-date=22 July 2011}}</ref> The demand was raised by the Raipur Congress unit in 1924 and was also discussed in the Indian Congress at [[Tripuri, Madhya Pradesh|Tripuri]]. A discussion about forming a Regional Congress organisation for Chhattisgarh took place. In 1954, when the State Reorganisation Commission was set up, the demand was put forward but was rejected. In 1955, the demand was raised in the Nagpur assembly of [[Madhya Bharat]].<ref name="Prithak Chhattisgarh" />

In the 1990s, the demand became more prominent, resulting in the formation of a statewide political forum known as the Chhattisgarh Rajya Nirman Manch. The forum was led by Chandulal Chadrakar and several successful region-wide strikes and rallies were organised under it, all of which were supported by major political parties, such as the [[Indian National Congress]] and the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]].<ref name="Prithak Chhattisgarh" />

The new National Democratic Alliance government sent the Separate Chhattisgarh Bill for approval by the Madhya Pradesh Assembly, where it was unanimously approved and then submitted to the [[Lok Sabha]]. The bill was passed in the Lok Sabha and the [[Rajya Sabha]], which allowed the creation of the state of Chhattisgarh. [[K. R. Narayanan]] gave his consent to the [[Madhya Pradesh Reorganisation Act]] on 25 August 2000 and the government of India set 1 November 2000 as the day Chhattisgarh would be separated from Madhya Pradesh.<ref name="Prithak Chhattisgarh" /> As such, Chhattisgarh was formed from Madhya Pradesh.<ref name="cgfinance.nic.in" />

== Geography ==
The northern and southern parts of the state are hilly, while the central part is a fertile [[plain]]. The highest point in the state is the Gaurlata near Samri, Balrampur-Ramanujganj district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://naidunia.jagran.com/search/chhattisgarh-highest-peak|title=Chhattisgarh Highest Peak: Latest Chhattisgarh Highest Peak News in Hindi – Naidunia|website=naidunia.jagran.com|access-date=13 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518144953/http://naidunia.jagran.com/search/chhattisgarh-highest-peak|archive-date=18 May 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Deciduous forests of the Eastern Highlands Forests cover roughly 44% of the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cgclimatechange.com/ongoing-projects/|title=Ongoing Projects|language=en-GB|access-date=29 December 2019|archive-date=29 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191229122359/http://cgclimatechange.com/ongoing-projects/|url-status=live}}</ref>
In the north lies the edge of the great [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]. The [[Rihand River]], a tributary of the [[Ganges River|Ganges]], drains this area. The eastern end of the [[Satpura Range]] and the western edge of the [[Chota Nagpur Plateau]] form an east–west belt of hills that divide the [[Mahanadi River]] basin from the Indo-Gangetic plain. The outline of Chhattisgarh is like a sea horse.

The central part of the state lies in the fertile upper basin of the [[Mahanadi River|Mahanadi]] and its tributaries, of which [[Shivnath River]] is a major one running around 300&nbsp;km long. This area has extensive rice cultivation. The upper Mahanadi basin is separated from the upper [[Narmada River|Narmada]] basin to the west by the [[Maikal Hill]]s (part of the Satpuras) and from the plains of Odisha to the east by ranges of hills. The southern part of the state lies on the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan plateau]], in the watershed of the [[Godavari River]] and its tributary, the [[Indravati River]]. The Mahanadi is the chief river of the state. The other main rivers are [[Hasdeo River|Hasdeo]] (a tributary of Mahanadi), [[Rihand]], [[Indravati]], [[Jonk River|Jonk]], Arpa and [[Shivnath River|Shivnath]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.india-wris.nrsc.gov.in/wrpinfo/index.php?title=Major_Rivers_Flowing_in_Chhattisgarh|title=Major Rivers Flowing in Chhattisgarh -|website=india-wris.nrsc.gov.in|access-date=5 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181005120535/http://www.india-wris.nrsc.gov.in/wrpinfo/index.php?title=Major_Rivers_Flowing_in_Chhattisgarh|archive-date=5 October 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Air===
[[File:Swami vivekananda Airport terminal Raipur. Night view.jpg|thumb|230px|Swami Vivekananda Airport]]
The air infrastructure in Chhattisgarh is gradually improving. [[Swami Vivekananda Airport]] in [[Raipur]] is the primary airport (domestic) and is well connected to all major cities of India. Besides this, the smaller [[Bilaspur Airport]], [[Jagdalpur Airport]]  and [[Ambikapur Airport]] are regionally connected with scheduled commercial services. A massive reduction in sales tax on aviation turbine fuel (ATF) from 25 to 4% in Chhattisgarh in 2003 contributed to a sharp rise in passenger flow. The passenger flow increased by 58% between 2011 and November 2012.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pranab hopes Raipur airport's new terminal will support Chhattisgarh's growth|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pranab-hopes-raipur-airports-new-terminal-will-support-chhattisgarhs-growth/article4075110.ece|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=8 November 2012|access-date=22 April 2013|location=Chennai, India|first=Suvojit|last=Bagchi|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904045832/http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pranab-hopes-raipur-airports-new-terminal-will-support-chhattisgarhs-growth/article4075110.ece|archive-date=4 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Agriculture ===
Agriculture is counted as the chief economic occupation of the state. According to a government estimate, the net sown area of the state is 4.828&nbsp;million hectares and the gross sown area is 5.788&nbsp;million hectares.<ref name="Agriculture in Chhattisgarh">{{cite web|title=Agriculture in Chhattisgarh |url=http://cg.gov.in/development/cdevelopment.htm#irrigation |access-date=22 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721155523/http://cg.gov.in/development/cdevelopment.htm |archive-date=21 July 2011 }}</ref> Horticulture and animal husbandry also engage a major share of the total population of the state.<ref>{{cite web|title=Economy of Chhattisgarh|url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/chhattisgarh/economy/|access-date=22 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507072918/http://www.mapsofindia.com/chhattisgarh/economy/|archive-date=7 May 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> About 80% of the population of the state is rural and the main livelihood of the villagers is agriculture and agriculture-based small industry.

The majority of the farmers are still practicing the traditional methods of cultivation, resulting in low growth rates and productivity. The farmers have to be made aware of modern technologies suitable to their holdings. Providing adequate knowledge to the farmers is essential for a better implementation of the agricultural development plans and to improve productivity.<ref name="nhm.nic.in">http://nhm.nic.in/ActionPlan/ActionPlan_Chhattisgarh.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Considering this and a very limited irrigated area, the productivity of not only rice but also other crops is low, hence the farmers are unable to obtain economic benefits from agriculture and it has remained as subsistence agriculture till now.

==== Agricultural products ====
The main crops are rice, maize,<ref>Oudhia, P. (1999) Allelopathic effects of Lantana camara L. on germination of soybean. Legume Research 22(4): 273–274.</ref> ''kodo-kutki'' and other small millets and pulses (''tuar''<ref>Oudhia, P. (2000). Positive (inhibitory) allelopathic effects of some obnoxious weeds on germination and seedling vigour of pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.). Research on Crops. 1 (1):116–118.</ref> and ''kulthi''); oilseeds, such as groundnuts (peanuts), soybeans<ref>Oudhia, P. (2001). Stimulatory allelopathic effects of Ageratum conyzoides L. on soybean. Agric. Sci. Digest. 21 (1):55–56.</ref> and sunflowers are also grown. In the mid-1990s, most of Chhattisgarh was still a monocrop belt. Only one-fourth to one-fifth of the sown area was double-cropped. When a very substantial portion of the population is dependent on agriculture, a situation where nearly 80% of a state's area is covered only by one crop, immediate attention to turn them into double crop areas is needed. Also, very few cash crops are grown in Chhattisgarh, so there is a need to diversify the agricultural produce towards oilseeds and other cash crops. Chhattisgarh is also called the "rice bowl of central India".<ref name="Agriculture in Chhattisgarh" />

==== Irrigation ====
[[File:Amritdhara chirimiri.jpg|thumb|Amritdhara chirimiri]]
In Chhattisgarh, rice, the main crop, is grown on about 77% of the net sown area. Only about 20% of the area is under irrigation; the rest depends on rain. Of the three agroclimatic zones, about 73% of the Chhattisgarh plains, 97% of the Bastar plateau, and 95% of the northern hills are rainfed. The irrigated area available for double cropping is only 87,000&nbsp;ha in the Chhattisgarh plains and 2300&nbsp;ha in Bastar plateau and northern hills. Due to this, the productivity of rice and other crops is low, hence the farmers are unable to obtain economic benefits from agriculture and it has remained as subsistence agriculture till now, though agriculture is the main occupation of more than 80% of the population.<ref name="nhm.nic.in" />

In the Chhattisgarh region, about 22% of the net cropped area was under irrigation as compared to 36.5% in Madhya Pradesh in 1998–99, whereas the average national irrigation was about 40%. The irrigation is characterised by a high order of variability ranging from 1.6% in Bastar to 75.0% in Dhamtari. Based on an average growth trend in the irrigated area, about 0.43% of additional area is brought under irrigation every year as compared to 1.89% in Madhya Pradesh and 1.0% in the country as a whole. Thus, irrigation has been growing at a very low rate in Chhattisgarh and the pace of irrigation is so slow, that it would take about 122 years to reach the 75% level of net irrigated area in Chhattisgarh at the present rate of growth.<ref name="nhm.nic.in" />

Chhattisgarh has a limited [[irrigation]] system, with dams and [[canal]]s on some rivers. Average rainfall in the state is around 1400&nbsp;mm and the entire state falls under the rice agroclimatic zone. The Large variation in the yearly rainfall directly affects the production of rice. Irrigation is the prime need of the state for its overall development and therefore the state government has given top priority to the development of irrigation.<ref name="Agriculture in Chhattisgarh" />

A total of four major, 33 medium, and 2199 minor irrigation projects have been completed and five major, nine medium, and 312 minor projects are under construction, as of 31 March 2006.{{Update inline|date=August 2019|reason=These numbers are from over ten years ago. Needs updating}}

=== Industrial sector ===

==== Power sector ====
Chhattisgarh is one of the few states of India where the power sector is effectively developed. Based on the current production of surplus electric power, the position of the State is comfortable and profitable. The Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board (CSEB) is in a strong position to meet the electricity requirement of the state and is in good financial health. According to [[Central Electricity Authority (India)|Central Electricity Authority]] (CEA), Chhattisgarh provides electricity to several other states because of surplus production.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2019/state-editions/chhattisgarh-is-power-surplus-state--confirms-cea-report.html|title=Chhattisgarh is power surplus state, confirms CEA report|last=Pioneer|first=The|website=The Pioneer|language=en|access-date=31 December 2019|archive-date=31 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191231114615/https://www.dailypioneer.com/2019/state-editions/chhattisgarh-is-power-surplus-state--confirms-cea-report.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In Chhattisgarh, [[National Thermal Power Corporation Limited]] (NTPC) has [[Sipat Thermal Power Station]] with a capacity of 2,980 MW at Sipat, Bilaspur; [[LARA Super Thermal Power Station]] with a nameplate capacity of 1600MW and [[Korba Super Thermal Power Station]] with a capacity of 2,600 MW at Korba, while CSEB's units have a thermal capacity of 1,780 MW and hydel capacity of 130 MW. Apart from NTPC and CSEB, there are several private generation units of large and small capacity. The state government has pursued a liberal policy with regard to captive generation which has resulted in a number of private companies coming up.<ref name="Power Sector in Chhattisgarh">{{cite web|title=Power Sector in Chhattisgarh|url=http://cserc.nic.in/power_sector.htm|access-date=22 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041211023325/http://www.cserc.nic.in/power_sector.htm|archive-date=11 December 2004|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The state has a potential of 61,000 MW of additional thermal power in terms of availability of coal for more than 100 years and more than 2,500 MW hydel capacity. To use this vast potential, substantial additions to the existing generation capacity are already underway.<ref name="Power Sector in Chhattisgarh" />

==== Steel sector ====
The steel industry is one of the biggest heavy industries of Chhattisgarh. [[Bhilai Steel Plant|Bhilai Steel Plant, Bhilai]] operated by [[Steel Authority of India Limited|SAIL]], with a capacity of 5.4&nbsp;million tonnes per year, is regarded as a significant growth indicator of the state. More than 100 steel rolling mills, 90 sponge iron plants, and ferro-alloy units are in Chhattisgarh. Along with Bhilai, today Raipur, Bilaspur, Korba and Raigarh have become the steel hub of Chhattisgarh. Today, Raipur has become the centre of the steel sector, the biggest market for steel in India.<ref name="Industries in Chhattisgarh">{{cite web|title=Industries in Chhattisgarh|url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/chhattisgarh/economy/chhattisgarh-industries.html|access-date=22 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810083204/http://www.mapsofindia.com/chhattisgarh/economy/chhattisgarh-industries.html|archive-date=10 August 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Mineral deposits ====
Chhattisgarh is rich in minerals. It produces 50% of the country's total cement production. Due to its proximity to the western States of Maharashtra and Gujarat, it has the highest producing [[coal mine]]s in India. It has the highest output of coal in the country with the second-highest reserves. It is third in iron ore production and first in tin production. [[Limestone]], [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]] and [[bauxite]] are abundant. It is the only [[tin]] ore-producing state in India. Other commercially extracted minerals include [[corundum]], [[garnet]], [[quartz]], [[marble]], [[alexandrite]] and diamonds.

Rowghat iron ore deposits are located in the Antagarh Tahsil of [[Kanker district]] and contain the largest [[iron ore]] deposits after the Bailadila Iron Ore Mine. Rowghat Mines' reserves have been assessed at 731.93 Mn tonnes. Bailadila has reserves assessed at 1.343 Bn tonnes.<ref name="chhattisgarhmines.gov.in">{{Cite web |url=http://chhattisgarhmines.gov.in/Iron-Ore.htm |title=Directorate of Geology and Mining, Chhattisgarh &#124; Directorate of Geology &#124; Chhattisgarh Mines &#124; Mines Chhattisgarh &#124; State Mines &#124; Department of Steel & Mines |access-date=2012-02-22 |archive-date=2011-07-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721165825/http://chhattisgarhmines.gov.in/Iron-Ore.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> Iron ore deposits in Rowghat were discovered in 1899 and in 1949 [[Geological Survey of India]] investigated the area.<ref name="financialexpress.com">{{Cite web|url = http://www.financialexpress.com/news/sc-flags-green-signal-for-forestry-clearance-to-rowghat/372170/0|title = SC flags green signal for forestry clearance to Rowghat|date = 13 October 2008|access-date = 16 March 2024|archive-date = 28 March 2024|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20240328162226/https://www.financialexpress.com/archive/sc-flags-green-signal-for-forestry-clearance-to-rowghat/372170/|url-status = live}}</ref>

The standard of living in Chhattisgarh is extremely imbalanced. The cities such as [[Durg]], Raipur, Bhilai and Bilaspur have a medium to high standard of living, while the rural and forested areas lack even the basic resources and amenities. For example, Bhilai has a literacy rate of 86%, while [[Bastar district|Bastar]] has a literacy rate of 54%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census2011.co.in/census/city/279-bhilai-nagar.html|title=Bhilai Nagar City Population Census 2011 – Chhattisgarh|website=census2011.co.in|access-date=10 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808042729/http://www.census2011.co.in/census/city/279-bhilai-nagar.html|archive-date=8 August 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Education Index ===
[[File:Girls students, Chhattisgarh, India.jpg|thumb|School children in Chhattisgarh]]
Chhattisgarh has an Education Index of 0.526 according to the 2011 NHDR, which is higher than that of the states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan. The Average Literacy rate in Chhattisgarh for Urban regions was 84.05 percent in which males were 90.58% literate while female literacy stood at 73.39%. Total literates in the urban region of Chhattisgarh were 4,370,966.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

Among the marginalized groups, STs are at the bottom of the rankings, further emphasizing the lack of social development in the state. Bastar and Dantewada in south Chhattisgarh are the most illiterate districts and the dropout ratio is the highest among all the districts. The reason for this is the extreme poverty in rural areas.

As per census 2011, the State has a population of 25.5&nbsp;million and six medical colleges (five Government and one private) with an intake capacity of 700 students and a doctor-patient ratio of 1:17,000.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chhattisgarh a poor State with low health indices: CAG |url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2017/state-editions/chhattisgarh-a-poor-state-with-low-health-indices-cag.html |website=The Pioneer |access-date=29 September 2018 |date=31 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929233452/https://www.dailypioneer.com/2017/state-editions/chhattisgarh-a-poor-state-with-low-health-indices-cag.html |archive-date=29 September 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
Under The NITI Aayog released Health Index report titled, "Healthy States, Progressive India", Chhattisgarh has an index of 52.02 Out of 100, which is better than states such as Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Odisha, Bihar, Assam and Uttar Pradesh.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pandey |first1=Kundan |title=NITI Aayog's Health Index: Kerala on top; Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh among worst performers |url=https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/niti-aayog-s-health-index-kerala-on-top-rajasthan-uttar-pradesh-among-worst-performers-59663 |website=Down To Earth |access-date=29 September 2018 |date=9 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810142701/https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/niti-aayog-s-health-index-kerala-on-top-rajasthan-uttar-pradesh-among-worst-performers-59663 |archive-date=10 August 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Despite different health-related schemes and programs, the health indicators such as the percentage of women with BMI<18.5, Under Five Mortality Rate and underweight children, are poor. This may be due to the difficulty in accessing the remote areas in the state. The prevalence of female malnutrition in Chhattisgarh is higher than the national average—half of the ST females are malnourished. The performance of SCs is a little better than the corresponding national and state average. The Under Five Mortality Rate among STs is significantly higher than the national average.

=== Net state domestic product ===
Chhattisgarh is one of the emerging states with relatively high growth rates of net state domestic product (NSDP) (8.2% vs. 7.1% All India over 2002–2008) and per capita NSDP (6.2% vs. 5.4% All India over 2002–2008). The growth rates of the said parameters are above the national averages and thus it appears that Chhattisgarh is catching up with other states in this respect. However, the state still has very low levels of per capita income as compared to the other states.

=== Urbanisation ===
Out of the total population of Chhattisgarh, 23.24% live in urban regions. The total population living in urban areas is 5,937,237, of which 3,035,469 are males and the remaining 2,901,768 are females.

Raipur, Durg, Bhilai Nagar, Bilaspur, Korba, Jagdalpur, Rajnandgaon, Ambikapur and Raigarh are some of the urban towns and cities in the region.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Chhattisgarh : Exp CG: Major Cities of Chhattisgarh: Raipur, Bilaspur, Durg-Bhilai, Raigarh, Korba, Jagdalpur, Ambikapur, Kawardha |url=https://explore-chhattisgarh.blogspot.com/2010/01/cities-of-chhattisgarh.html |access-date=2024-07-15 |website=Chhattisgarh}}</ref>

=== Sex ratio ===
There are more than 13 million males and 12.9&nbsp;million females in Chhattisgarh, which constitutes 2.11% of the country's population. The [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] in the state is one of the most balanced in India with 991 females per 1,000 males, as is the child sex ratio with 964 females per 1,000 males (Census 2011)

=== Fertility rate ===
Chhattisgarh has a fairly high fertility rate (2.4) as of 2017 compared to All India (2.2) and the replacement rate (2.1). It has a rural fertility rate of 2.6 and an urban fertility rate of 1.9

=== SC and ST population ===
With the exception of the hilly states of the north-east, Chhattisgarh has one of highest shares of Scheduled Tribe (ST) populations within a state, accounting for about 10 percent of the STs in India. Scheduled Tribes make up 30.62% of the population. The tribals are an important part of the state population and mainly inhabit the dense forests of Bastar and other districts of south Chhattisgarh. The percentage increase in the population of the scheduled list of tribals during the 2001–2011 decade had been at the rate of 18.23%. The Scheduled Caste (SC) population of Chhattisgarh is 2,418,722 as per the 2001 census constituting 11.6 percent of the total population (20,833,803). The proportion of Scheduled Castes has increased from 11.6 percent in 2001 to 12.8% in 2011.

=== Poverty ===
[[File:Diospyros melanoxylon Tendu.jpg|thumb|[[Tendu (tree)|Tendu]] Patta (Leaf) collection in Chhattisgarh, India.]]
The incidence of poverty in Chhattisgarh is very high. The estimated poverty ratio in 2004–05 based on uniform reference period consumption was around 50 percent, which is approximately double the all-India level. The incidence of poverty in the rural and urban areas is almost the same.

More than half of the rural STs and urban SCs are poor. In general, the proportion of poor SC and ST households in the state is higher than the state average and their community's respective national averages (except for rural SC households). Given that more than 50 percent of the state's population is ST and SC, the high incidence of income poverty among them is a matter of serious concern in the state.

This indicates that the good economic performance in recent years has not percolated to this socially deprived group, which is reflected in their poor performance in human development indicators.

=== Access to drinking water ===
In terms of access to improved drinking water sources, at the aggregate level, Chhattisgarh fared better than the national average and the SCs of the state performed better than the corresponding national average. Scheduled Tribes are marginally below the state average, but still better than the STs at the all-India level.

The proportion of households with access to improved sources of drinking water in 2008–09 was 91%. This proportion was over 90% even in states like Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. This was largely because these states had over 70% of their households accessing tube wells/hand pumps as sources of drinking water.

=== Sanitation ===
Sanitation facilities in the state were abysmally low with only about 41 percent having toilet facilities before the [[Swachh Bharat Mission]] was Launched by the Government of India. The Urban areas of Chhattisgarh attained the title of open defecation free on 2 October 2017 and the rural areas have achieved a 90.31% sanitation coverage. What sets Chhattisgarh apart from other states of India is an approach to bring in behavioural change in order to get open defecation-free status. In Chhattisgarh, people don't get toilet incentives, they have to construct the toilet with their own money, after using the toilet for 3 months they are entitled to the incentive amount.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://swachhindia.ndtv.com/commendable-progress-urban-rural-sanitation-chhattisgarh-way-open-defecation-free-12041/|title=With Commendable Progress in Both Urban And Rural Sanitation, Chhattisgarh Is on Its Way To Be Open Defecation Free – Swachh Report Card|date=19 September 2017|access-date=10 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810143753/https://swachhindia.ndtv.com/commendable-progress-urban-rural-sanitation-chhattisgarh-way-open-defecation-free-12041/|archive-date=10 August 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Teledensity ===
Across states, it has been found that [[teledensity]] (telephone density) was below 10 percent in 2010 for Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, reflecting a lack of access to telephones in these relatively poorer states. But due to development of new technology the teledensity in 2017 is 68.08 percent which shows improvement of telecom infrastructure. On the other hand, for states like Delhi and Himachal Pradesh and metropolitan cities like Kolkata, Mumbai, and Chennai, teledensity was over 100 percent in 2010 implying that individuals have more than one telephone connection.

=== Road density ===
The total density of National Highways (NHs) in Chhattisgarh is at 23.4&nbsp;km per 1,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> out of the total length of 3,168&nbsp;km in the State, the Central Government has informed.

The plains are numerically dominated by castes such as [[Teli]], [[Ghasidas|Satnami]] and [[Yadav]] while forest areas are mainly occupied by tribes such as [[Gondi people|Gond]], [[Halba (tribe)|Halba]], [[Kamar language|Kamar]]/Bujia and [[Oraon people|Oraon]]. There is also a large [[Odia people|Odia]] population. A community of [[Bengalis]] has existed in major cities since the times of the [[British Raj]]. They are associated with education, industry, and services.

According to the 2011 census, 93.25% of Chhattisgarh's population practised Hinduism, while 2.02% followed [[Islam]], 1.92% followed Christianity and a smaller number followed [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Jainism]] or other religions.<ref name="census2011">{{cite web|date=2011|title=Details of communities shown under 'Other Religions and Persuasions'|url=https://censusindia.gov.in/2011census/DDW00C-01%20Appendix%20MDDS.xlsx|url-status=live|website=censusindia.gov.in|publisher=Office of the Registrar General & Census Commissioner, India|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803134400/http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/DDW00C-01%20Appendix%20MDDS.xlsx |archive-date=3 August 2016 }}</ref>

Hindus are the majority in the state and are the dominant religion in all districts of the state. One sect particular to Chhattisgarh are the Satnamis, who follow [[Ghasidas|Guru Ghasidas]], a saint who promoted bhakti towards God and against the caste system. Chhattisgarh has many famous pilgrimage sites, such as the [[Bambleshwari Temple]] in [[Dongargarh]] and [[Danteshwari Temple|Danteshwari temple]] in the [[Dantewada]], one of the Shakti Peethas. Buddhism was once a major religion in Chhattisgarh.

Islam is the second-largest religion, concentrated in urban centres. Most Christians are tribals from the Surguija region.

The official language of the state is [[Hindi]], with [[Chhattisgarhi language|Chhattisgarhi]] being the additional official language. Chhattisgarhi is spoken and understood by the majority of people in Chhattisgarh and is the dominant language in the Chhattisgarh plain. Chhattisgarhi is called Khaltahi by tribals and Laria in [[Odia language|Odia]]. Chhattisgarhi is itself divided into many dialects, one of the most distinct being [[Surgujia dialect|Surgujia]] from the Surguja region, which is sometimes considered its own language. Near the Uttar Pradesh border this dialect merges into [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]], while it merges with [[Bagheli language|Bagheli]] near the Madhya Pradesh border. Surgujia also merges into [[Sadri language|Sadri]] in the northeast along the border with Jharkhand. [[Hindi]] is spoken by many migrants from outside the state, and is a major language in the cities and industrial centres, while many whose language is actually Chhattisgarhi record their speech as Hindi in the census. [[Odia language|Odia]] is widely spoken in eastern Chhattisgarh, especially near the Odisha border. Telugu and Marathi speaking minorities can be found along the Telangana and Maharashtra borders respectively. In the eastern Bastar region, [[Halbi language|Halbi]] and [[Bhatri language|Bhatri]] are major languages.

In addition, Chhattisgarh has several indigenous languages. [[Kurukh language|Kurukh]] and [[Korwa language|Korwa]] are both spoken in the Surguja region. [[Gondi language|Gondi]] is a major language in southern Chhattisgarh: Bastar and the adjoining districts. Gondi has many dialects, such as [[Muria language|Muria]] in north Bastar, which transitions to [[Madiya language|Madia]] further south and Dorli, transitional between Gondi and [[Koya language|Koya]], along the borders of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. In the east of Bastar. Most Gonds in the north and east of Bastar, as well as the rest of the state, speak regional languages and have largely forgotten their original tongue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kanker.gov.in/art.html|title=District - North Baster, Kanker|date=8 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008235722/http://kanker.gov.in/art.html|archive-date=8 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bastar.gov.in/people_and_culture.htm|title=District-Bastar, Chhattishgarh|publisher=bastar.gov.in|access-date=13 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916000959/http://bastar.gov.in/people_and_culture.htm|archive-date=16 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.languageinindia.com/junjulaug2001/bastar.html|title=Language in India|publisher=languageinindia.com|access-date=13 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202231005/http://www.languageinindia.com/junjulaug2001/bastar.html|archive-date=2 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmijag.in/Bastar.html|title=BASTAR REGION|website=cmijag.in|access-date=13 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913230846/http://www.cmijag.in/Bastar.html|archive-date=13 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Gender ratio ===
Chhattisgarh has a high female-male [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] (991)<ref>{{cite web|title=Chhattisgarh, At a glance|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/data_files/Chhattishgarh/2.%20Chhattishgarh%20Figures%20at%20a%20glance.pdf|publisher=Census 2011, Ministry of Home Affair, India|access-date=22 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813034404/http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/data_files/Chhattishgarh/2.%20Chhattishgarh%20Figures%20at%20a%20glance.pdf|archive-date=13 August 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> ranking at the fifth position among other states of India. Although this ratio is small compared to other states, it is unique in India because Chhattisgarh is the 10th-largest state in India.

The gender ratio (number of females per 1,000 males) has been steadily declining over 20th century in Chhattisgarh. But it is conspicuous that Chhattisgarh always had a better female-to-male ratio compared with national average.

Rural women, although poor, are independent, better organised, and socially outspoken. According to another local custom, women can choose to terminate a marriage relationship through a custom called ''chudi pahanana'', if she desires. Most of the old temples and shrines follow [[Shaktism]] and are goddess-centric (e.g., [[Shabari]], [[Mahamaya]], [[Danteshwari Temple|Danteshwari]]) and the existence of these temples gives insight into the historical and current social fabric of this state. However, a mention of these progressive local customs in no way suggests that the ideology of female subservience does not exist in Chhattisgarh. On the contrary, male authority and dominance are seen quite clearly in social and cultural life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Social Structure in Chhattisgarh |url=http://www.korbacity.com/index.php/know-more-about-chhattisgarh/chhattisgarh-social-structure.html |access-date=22 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720005404/http://www.korbacity.com/index.php/know-more-about-chhattisgarh/chhattisgarh-social-structure.html |archive-date=20 July 2011 }}</ref>

The state hosts many religious sects such as [[Satnampanth]], [[Kabirpanth]], [[Ramnami Samaj]] and others. [[Champaran, Chhattisgarh|Champaran]] is a small town with religious significance as the birthplace of the saint [[Vallabha]]charya, increasingly important as a pilgrimage site for the Gujarati community.

Chhattisgarh has a significant role in the life of the Lord [[Rama]]. Lord Rama along with his wife Sita and his younger brother [[Lakshmana]] had started his ''[[Vanvas]]'' (exile) in the Bastar, then known as Dandakarayna. They lived more than 10 of their 14 years of Vanvas in different places of Chhattisgarh. One of the remarkable places is [[Shivrinarayan]] which is nearby [[Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh|Bilaspur]] district of Chhattisgarh. Shivrinarayan was named after an old lady [[Shabari]]. When Ram visited Shabari she said "I do not have anything to offer other than my heart, but here are some berry fruits. May it please you, my Lord."{{quote without source|date=February 2023}} Saying so, Shabari offered the fruits she had meticulously collected to Rama. When Rama was tasting them, Lakshmana raised the concern that Shabari had already tasted them and therefore unworthy of eating. To this Rama said that of the many types of food he had tasted, "nothing could equal these berry fruits, offered with such devotion. You taste them, then alone will you know. Whomsoever offers a fruit, leaf, flower or some water with love, I partake it with great joy."{{quote without source|date=February 2023}}

The [[Odia culture]] is prominent in the eastern parts of Chhattisgarh bordering Odisha.

=== Literature ===
Chhattisgarh is a storehouse of literature, performing arts and crafts—all of which derives its substance and sustenance from the day-to-day life experiences of its people. Religion, mythology, social and political events, nature, and folklore are favourite motifs. Traditional crafts include painting, woodcarving, bell metal craft, bamboo ware, and tribal jewellery. Chhattisgarh has a rich literary heritage with roots that lie deep in the sociological and historical movements of the region. Its literature reflects the regional consciousness and the evolution of an identity distinct from others in Central India.

=== Crafts ===
Chhattisgarh is known for "Kosa silk" and "Dhokra or Bell metal art". Besides saris and salwar suits, the fabric is used to create lehengas, stoles, shawls and menswear including jackets, shirts, achkans and sherwanis. Works by the internationally renowned sculptor, Sushil Sakhuja's Dhokra Nandi, are available at the government's Shabari Chhattisgarh State Emporium, Raipur.

=== Dance ===
Panthi, Raut Nacha, Pandwani, Chaitra, Kaksar, Saila, Khamb-swang, Bhatra Naat, Rahas, Raai, Maao-Pata and Soowa are the several indigenous dance styles of Chhattisgarh.

Panthi, the folk dance of the Satnami community, has religious overtones. Panthi is performed on Maghi Purnima, the anniversary of the birth of [[Ghasidas|Guru Ghasidas]]. The dancers dance around a jaitkhamb set up for the occasion, to songs eulogising their spiritual head. The songs reflect a view of ''[[nirvana]]'', conveying the spirit of their guru's renunciation and the teachings of saint poets like [[Kabir]], Ramdas and Dadu. Dancers with bent torsos and swinging arms dance, carried away by their devotion. As the rhythm quickens, they perform acrobatics and form human pyramids.<ref>{{cite web|title=Panthi Dance|url=http://www.sangeetnatak.org/deshparva/desaj/panthi.htm|access-date=27 July 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002123235/http://www.sangeetnatak.org/deshparva/desaj/panthi.htm|archive-date=2 October 2011}}</ref>

[[Pandavani]] is a folk ballad form performed predominantly in Chhattisgarh. It depicts the story of the Pandavas, the leading characters in the epic Mahabharata. The artists in the Pandavani narration consist of a lead artist and some supporting singers and musicians. There are two styles of narration in Pandavani, Vedamati, and Kapalik. In the Vedamati style, the lead artist narrates in a simple manner by sitting on the floor throughout the performance. The Kaplik style is livelier, where the narrator actually enacts the scenes and characters. Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Vibhushan [[Teejan Bai]] is most popular artist of Pandavani<ref>{{cite web|title=Pandawani|url=http://durg.gov.in/DistrictProfile_ArtsAndCulture.html|access-date=27 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830152418/http://durg.gov.in/DistrictProfile_ArtsAndCulture.html|archive-date=30 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>
