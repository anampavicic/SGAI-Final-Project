Adelaide is situated on the [[Adelaide Plains]] north of the [[Fleurieu Peninsula]], between the [[Gulf St Vincent]] in the west and the [[Mount Lofty Ranges]] in the east. Its metropolitan area extends {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the coast to the [[Adelaide Hills|foothills]] of the Mount Lofty Ranges, and stretches {{convert|96|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Gawler]] in the north to [[Sellicks Beach]] in the south.

Named in honour of [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Queen Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen]], wife of [[William IV|King William IV]], the city was founded in 1836 as the [[new town|planned capital]] for the only freely-settled British province in Australia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/how-well-do-you-really-know-our-queen-adelaide/news-story/b249bd054376d472496f232a7f3d75ed|title=How well do you know our Queen?|date=3 May 2013|website=The Advertiser|location=Adelaide|access-date=7 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807040642/https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/how-well-do-you-really-know-our-queen-adelaide/news-story/b249bd054376d472496f232a7f3d75ed|archive-date=7 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> [[William Light|Colonel William Light]], one of Adelaide's founding fathers, designed the city centre and chose its location close to the [[River Torrens]]. Light's design, now [[Australian National Heritage List|listed as national heritage]], set out the city centre in a [[grid plan|grid layout]] known as "[[Light's Vision]]", interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares, and entirely surrounded by park lands.

Early colonial Adelaide was shaped by the diversity and wealth of its free settlers, in contrast to the convict history of other Australian cities. It was Australia's third most populated city until the [[post-war]] era. It has been noted for its leading examples of religious freedom and progressive political reforms, and became known as the "[[City of Churches]]" due to its diversity of faiths. The city has also been renowned for its [[Automotive_industry_in_Australia#Holden|automotive industry]], as well as being the original host of the [[Australian Grand Prix]] in the [[Formula One|FIA Formula One World Championship]] from 1985 to 1995. Today, Adelaide is known by [[:Category:Festivals in Adelaide|its many festivals]] and sporting events, its [[South Australian wine|food and wine]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Best Adelaide Wine Tasting Tours & Sightseeing |url=https://bostours.com.au/ |access-date=2024-07-12 |website=BOS Adelaide Wine Tours and Sightseeing |language=en-US}}</ref> its coastline and hills, its large defence and manufacturing sectors, and its emerging space sector, including the [[Australian Space Agency]] being headquartered here.

The area around modern-day Adelaide was originally inhabited by the Indigenous [[Kaurna]] people, one of many [[Aboriginal Australian|Aboriginal]] tribes in South Australia. The city and [[Adelaide park lands|parklands]] area was known as Tarntanya,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://adelaidia.sa.gov.au/subjects/kaurna-people|title=Kaurna people|website=Adelaidia|date=20 March 2017 |access-date=28 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908065802/http://adelaidia.sa.gov.au/subjects/kaurna-people|archive-date=8 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Tandanya, now the short name of [[Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute]], Tarndanya,<ref>{{cite web | title=Reconciliation | website=Adelaide City Council | url=https://www.adelaide.edu.au/kwp/placenames/council/areas/map_tarndanyangga.html | access-date=5 July 2021 | archive-date=12 July 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190712144205/https://www.adelaide.edu.au/kwp/placenames/council/areas/map_tarndanyangga.html | url-status=dead }}</ref> or [[Tarndanyangga]], now the dual name for Victoria Square, in the [[Kaurna language]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kaurnaplacenames.com/primary.php?id=4697 |title=Kaurna Name: Tarndanyangga |access-date=28 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312102340/http://kaurnaplacenames.com/primary.php?id=4697 |archive-date=12 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> The name means 'male red kangaroo rock', referring to a rock formation on the site that has now been destroyed.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Do you know what Aboriginal land you're on today? |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/do-you-know-what-aboriginal-land-youre-on-today/ytff85vi1 |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=NITV |language=en}}</ref>

The surrounding area was an open grassy plain with patches of trees and shrubs which had been managed by hundreds of generations. Kaurna country encompassed the plains which stretched north and south of Tarntanya as well as the wooded foothills of the [[Mount Lofty Ranges|Mt Lofty Ranges]]. The River Torrens was known as the Karrawirra Pari (Red Gum forest river). About 300 Kaurna populated the Adelaide area, and were referred to by the settlers as the Cowandilla.<ref name="KaurnaSA">{{cite web|url=https://sahistoryhub.history.sa.gov.au:443/subjects/kaurna-people?hh=1&|website=SA History Hub|title=Kaurna People|access-date=29 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190428075730/http://sahistoryhub.com.au/subjects/kaurna-people|archive-date=28 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

There were more than 20 local clans across the plain who lived semi-nomadic lives, with extensive [[Mound|mound settlements]] where huts were built repeatedly over centuries and a complex social structure including a class of sorcerers separated from regular society.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Owen |first1=Timothy |last2=Pate |first2=Donald |date=2014-12-01 |title=A Kaurna burial, Salisbury, South Australia: Further evidence for complex late Holocene Aboriginal social systems in the Adelaide region |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03122417.2014.11682018 |journal=Australian Archaeology |language=en |volume=79 |issue=1 |pages=45–53 |doi=10.1080/03122417.2014.11682018 |s2cid=148063575 |issn=0312-2417}}</ref>

Based on the ideas of [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]] about colonial reform, [[Robert Gouger]] petitioned the British government to create a new colony in Australia, resulting in the passage of the [[South Australia Act 1834]]. Physical establishment of the colony began with the arrival of the first British colonisers in February 1836. The first [[Governor of South Australia|governor]] 
proclaimed the commencement of colonial government in South Australia on 28 December 1836, near [[The Old Gum Tree]] in what is now the suburb of [[Glenelg North]]. The event is commemorated in South Australia as [[Proclamation Day (South Australia)|Proclamation Day]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holdfast.sa.gov.au/page.aspx?u=1463 |title=City of Holdfast Bay – Proclamation Day |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713121428/http://www.holdfast.sa.gov.au/page.aspx?u=1463 |archive-date=13 July 2012 }}</ref> The site of the colony's capital was surveyed and laid out by Colonel [[William Light]], the first surveyor-general of South Australia, with his own original, unique, topographically sensitive design.

Adelaide was established as a planned colony of free immigrants, promising civil liberties and freedom from religious persecution, based upon the ideas of [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]]. Wakefield had read accounts of Australian settlement while in prison in London for attempting to abduct an heiress,<ref>Wakefield cites:
* Edward Curr, ''An Account of the Colony of Van Diemen's Land, principally designed for the use of emigrants'', George Cowie & Co., London, 1824;

As it was believed that in a colony of free settlers there would be little crime, no provision was made for a [[Prison|gaol]] in Colonel Light's 1837 plan. But by mid-1837 the ''[[South Australian Register]]'' was warning of escaped convicts from New South Wales and tenders for a temporary gaol were sought. Following a burglary, a murder, and two attempted murders in Adelaide during March 1838, Governor Hindmarsh created the South Australian Police Force (now the [[South Australia Police]]) in April 1838 under 21-year-old [[Henry Inman (police commander)|Henry Inman]].<ref>[[John Wrathall Bull|J.

Adelaide's early history was marked by economic uncertainty and questionable leadership.{{Dubious|date=October 2015}} The first governor of South Australia, [[John Hindmarsh]], clashed frequently with others, in particular the Resident Commissioner, [[James Hurtle Fisher]]. The rural area surrounding Adelaide was surveyed by Light in preparation to sell a total of over {{convert|405|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land. Adelaide's early economy started to get on its feet in 1838 with the arrival of livestock from [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], [[New South Wales]] and [[Tasmania]]. Wool production provided an early basis for the South Australian economy. By 1860, wheat farms had been established from [[Encounter Bay]] in the south to [[Clare, South Australia|Clare]] in the north.

[[File:Karte Adelaide MKL1888.png|thumb|left|upright|alt= Refer to caption|1888 map of Adelaide, showing the gradual development of its urban layout.]]
[[George Gawler]] took over from Hindmarsh in late 1838 and, despite being under orders from the ''Select Committee on South Australia'' in Britain not to undertake any public works, promptly oversaw construction of a governor's house, the [[Adelaide Gaol]], police barracks, a hospital, a customs house and a wharf at [[Port Adelaide]]. Gawler was recalled and replaced by [[George Edward Grey]] in 1841. Grey slashed public expenditure against heavy opposition, although its impact was negligible at this point: silver was discovered in [[Glen Osmond]] that year, agriculture was well underway, and other mines sprung up all over the state, aiding Adelaide's commercial development. The city exported meat, wool, wine, fruit and wheat by the time Grey left in 1845, contrasting with a low point in 1842 when one-third of Adelaide houses were abandoned.

Trade links with the rest of the Australian states were established after the [[Murray River]] was successfully navigated in 1853 by [[Francis Cadell (explorer)|Francis Cadell]], an Adelaide resident. South Australia became a [[self-governing colony]] in 1856 with the ratification of a new constitution by the British parliament. [[Secret ballot]]s were introduced, and a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] parliament was elected on 9 March 1857, by which time 109,917 people lived in the province.<ref>{{cite web |author=Blair, Robert D. |year=2001 |title=Events in South Australian History 1834–1857 |work=Pioneer Association of South Australia |url=http://www.users.on.net/~rdblair/events-sa.htm |access-date=10 May 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607150032/http://www.users.on.net/~rdblair/events-sa.htm |archive-date=7 June 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1860, the [[Thorndon Park Reserve|Thorndon Park reservoir]] was opened, providing an alternative water source to the now turbid River Torrens. Gas street lighting was implemented in 1867, the [[University of Adelaide]] was founded in 1874, the [[South Australian Art Gallery]] opened in 1881 and the [[Happy Valley Reservoir]] opened in 1896. In the 1890s Australia was affected by a severe economic depression, ending a hectic era of land booms and tumultuous expansionism. Financial institutions in Melbourne and banks in Sydney closed. The national fertility rate fell and immigration was reduced to a trickle.<ref name="Guide">{{Cite web|url=https://clickacity.com/history-of-adelaide/|title=History of Adelaide, Australia.

The value of South Australia's exports nearly halved. Drought and poor harvests from 1884 compounded the problems, with some families leaving for Western Australia.<ref name="Guide"/> Adelaide was not as badly hit as the larger gold-rush cities of Sydney and Melbourne, and silver and lead discoveries at [[Broken Hill]] provided some relief. Only one year of deficit was recorded, but the price paid was retrenchments and lean public spending.

Adelaide enjoyed a postwar boom, entering a time of relative prosperity. Its population grew, and it became the third most populous metropolitan area in the country, after Sydney and Melbourne. Its prosperity was short-lived, with the return of droughts and the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s. It later returned to fortune under strong government leadership. [[Secondary sector of industry|Secondary industries]] helped reduce the state's dependence on [[primary sector of industry|primary industries]]. World War II brought industrial stimulus and diversification to Adelaide under the [[Thomas Playford IV|Playford]] Government, which advocated Adelaide as a safe place for manufacturing due to its less vulnerable location.<ref>Cockburn, S (1991): ''Playford – Benevolent Despot.'' Axiom Publishing. P. 85. {{ISBN|0 9594164 4 7}}</ref> Shipbuilding was expanded at the nearby port of [[Whyalla, South Australia|Whyalla]].

The South Australian Government in this period built on former wartime manufacturing industries but neglected cultural facilities which meant South Australia's economy lagged behind.<ref name="Marsden" /> International manufacturers like [[Holden]] and [[Fiat Chrysler Australia|Chrysler]]<ref>When Chrysler stopped manufacturing in Adelaide, [[Mitsubishi Motors Australia]] took over the [[Tonsley Park]] factory.

The [[Mannum–Adelaide pipeline]] brought [[River Murray]] water to Adelaide in 1955 and [[Adelaide Airport|an airport]] opened at [[West Beach, South Australia|West Beach]] in 1955. [[Flinders University]] and the [[Flinders Medical Centre]] were established in the 1960s at Bedford Park, south of the city.

In the post-war years around the early 1960s, Adelaide was surpassed by Brisbane as Australia's third largest city.<ref name="Marsden" />

{{Further|William Light}}
Adelaide is a planned city, designed by the first Surveyor-General of South Australia, Colonel [[William Light]]. His plan, sometimes referred to as "Light's Vision" (also the name of a statue of him on [[Montefiore Hill]]), arranged Adelaide in a [[Grid plan|grid]], with [[:Category:Squares in Adelaide|five squares]] in the [[Adelaide city centre]] and a ring of parks, known as the [[Adelaide Parklands]], surrounding it. Light's selection of the location for the city was initially unpopular with the early settlers, as well as South Australia's first governor, John Hindmarsh, due to its distance from the harbour at Port Adelaide, and the lack of fresh water there.<ref>Page, M. (1981): ''Port Adelaide and its Institute, 1851–1979.'' Rigby Publishers Ltd. Pp.17–20. {{ISBN|0-7270-1510-9}}</ref>
[[File:Adelaide South Australia - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The [[Adelaide city centre|city centre]] was built on a [[grid plan]], known as ''Light's Vision''.]]
Light successfully persisted with his choice of location against this initial opposition. Recent evidence suggests that Light worked closely with George Kingston as well as a team of men to set out Adelaide, using various templates for city plans going back to [[Ancient Greece]], including [[Italian Renaissance]] designs and the similar layouts of the American cities [[Philadelphia]] and [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]]–which, like Adelaide, follow the same layout of a central city square, four complementing city squares surrounding it and a parklands area that surrounds the city centre.<ref>{{cite book|title=Adelaide|first=Kerryn|last=Goldsworthy|year=2011|publisher=NewSouth|isbn=9-7817-4224092-3|pages=83}}</ref>
[[File:Transformers - Victoria Square Adelaide SA - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of [[Victoria Square, Adelaide|Victoria Square]], one of the five main squares in the city centre and considered the heart of Adelaide's [[Grid plan|grid layout]].]]
The benefits of Light's design are numerous: Adelaide has had wide multi-lane roads from its beginning, an easily navigable [[cardinal direction]] grid layout and an expansive green ring around the city centre. There are two sets of [[ring road]]s in Adelaide that have resulted from the original design. The [[City Ring Route, Adelaide|inner ring route]] ([[A21 road (Australia)|A21]]) borders the parklands, and the outer route ([[A3 road (South Australia)|A3]]/[[South Road, Adelaide|A13]]/[[A16 highway (Australia)|A16]]/[[A17 highway (Australia)|A17]]) completely bypasses the inner city via (in clockwise order) [[Grand Junction Road]], Hampstead Road, Ascot Avenue, [[Portrush Road]], [[Cross Road, Adelaide|Cross Road]] and [[South Road, Adelaide|South Road]].<ref>[http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/transport_network/projects/better_roads/adelaides_inner_outer_ring_routes.asp ''Adelaide's Inner and Outer Ring Routes''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306220115/http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/transport_network/projects/better_roads/adelaides_inner_outer_ring_routes.asp |date=6 March 2014 }}, 24 August 2004, South Australian Department of Transport.</ref>

Suburban expansion has to some extent outgrown Light's original plan. Numerous former outlying villages and "country towns", as well as the satellite city of [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]], have been enveloped by its [[urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]]. Expanding developments in the Adelaide Hills region led to the construction of the [[South Eastern Freeway]] to cope with growth, which has subsequently led to new developments and further improvements to that transport corridor. Similarly, the booming development in Adelaide's [[City of Onkaparinga|South]] led to the construction of the [[Southern Expressway (Australia)|Southern Expressway]].

New roads are not the only transport infrastructure developed to cope with the urban growth. The [[O-Bahn Busway]] is an example of a unique solution to [[Tea Tree Gully, South Australia|Tea Tree Gully's]] transport woes in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Adelaide's Freeways – A History from MATS to the Port River Expressway |work=Ozroads |url=http://www.ozroads.com.au/SA/freeways.htm |access-date=21 January 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927114830/http://www.ozroads.com.au/SA/freeways.htm |archive-date=27 September 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> The development of the nearby suburb of [[Golden Grove, South Australia|Golden Grove]] in the late 1980s followed a planned approach to urban growth.

In the 1960s, a [[Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study]] Plan was proposed to cater for the future growth of the city. The plan involved the construction of freeways, [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]] and the upgrade of certain aspects of the public transport system. The then premier [[Steele Hall (Australian politician)|Steele Hall]] approved many parts of the plan and the government went as far as purchasing land for the project. The later [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government elected under [[Don Dunstan]] shelved the plan, but allowed the purchased land to remain vacant, should the future need for freeways arise. In 1980, the [[Liberal party of Australia|Liberal party]] won government and premier [[David Tonkin]] committed his government to selling off the land acquired for the MATS plan, ensuring that even when needs changed, the construction of most MATS-proposed freeways would be impractical. Some parts of this land have been used for transport, (e.g. the O-Bahn Busway and Southern Expressway), while most has been progressively subdivided for residential use.

In 2008, the [[Government of South Australia|SA Government]] announced plans for a network of [[transport-oriented development]]s across the Adelaide metropolitan area and purchased a [[Clipsal site development|10 hectare industrial site]] at [[Bowden, South Australia|Bowden]] for $52.5&nbsp;million as the first of these developments.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081206075528/http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id=3826 "Clipsal site at Bowden to become a green village"], Ministerial Press Release, 24 October 2008, SA Govt.

==== Housing ====
{{Main|Australian residential architectural styles}}
[[File:Heritage terraces on Adelaide's North Terrace.jpg|thumb|right|Terraced housing on [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]]]]
Historically, Adelaide's suburban residential areas have been characterised by single-storey detached houses built on {{convert|1/4|acre|m2|adj=on|order=flip}} blocks. A relative lack of suitable, locally-available timber for construction purposes led to the early development of a brick-making industry, as well as the use of stone, for houses and other buildings. By 1891, 68% of houses were built of stone, 15% of timber, and 10% of brick, with brick also being widely used in stone houses for quoins, door and window surrounds, and chimneys and fireplaces.<ref>Gibbs, R.M. (2013): ''Under the burning sun: a history of colonial South Australia, 1836–1900''. Peacock Publications. Pp. 58, 333–4. {{ISBN|978-1-921601-85-9}}</ref>

There is a wide variety in the styles of these houses. Until the 1960s, most of the more substantial houses were built of red brick, though many front walls were of ornamental stone. Then cream bricks became fashionable, and in the 1970s, deep red and brown bricks became popular.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Until the 1970s, roofs tended to be clad with (painted) [[corrugated iron]] or cement or clay tiles, usually red "terracotta"<!--local terminology, do not link-->. Since then, [[Colorbond]] corrugated steel has dominated. Most roofs are pitched. Flat roofs are not common.<ref name=Cadden/>

Up to the 1970s, most houses were of "double brick" construction on concrete footings, with timber floors laid on joists supported by "dwarf walls". Later houses have mainly been of "[[brick veneer]]" construction – structural [[Framing (construction)|timber]] or, more recently, [[steel frame#Cold-formed steel frames|lightweight steel]] frame on a [[concrete slab]] [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]], lined with [[Gyprock]], and with an outer skin of brickwork,<ref name=Cadden>Rosemary Cadden: ''Building South Australia: celebrating 125 years''. Solstice Media. pp. 77, 87. {{ISBN|978-0-646-51343-0}}</ref> to cope with Adelaide's [[Shrink–swell capacity|reactive soils]], particularly Keswick Clay, black earth and some red-brown earth soils.<ref>Sheard, M. J., & A. P. Belperio (1995): "Problem soils". In: Drexel, J. F. & Preiss, W. V. (eds.) ''The geology of South Australia''. Vol.2, The Phanerozoic. p. 274. South Australia Geological Survey, Bulletin 54. {{ISBN|978-0-7308-0621-9}}</ref> The use of precast concrete panels for floor and wall construction has also increased.<ref name=Cadden /> In addition to this, a significant factor in Adelaide's suburban history is the role of the [[South Australian Housing Trust]].{{Why|date=January 2023}}

Retrieved 30 May 2018.</ref> Rainfall is unreliable, light and infrequent throughout summer, although heavy falls can occur. The winter has fairly reliable rainfall with June being the wettest month of the year, averaging around 80&nbsp;mm. [[Frost]]s are occasional, with the most notable occurrences in 1908 and 1982. Hail is common in winter.

Adelaide is a windy city with significant [[wind chill]] in winter, which makes the temperature [[apparent temperature|seem colder than it actually is]]. Snowfall in the metropolitan area is extremely rare, although light and sporadic falls in the nearby hills and at [[Mount Lofty]] occur during winter. Dewpoints in the summer typically range from {{convert|8|to|10|°C|°F}}.

== Governance ==
{{Main|Government of South Australia}}

[[File:Parliament House, South Australia.jpg|thumb|[[Parliament House, Adelaide]]]]

Adelaide, as the capital of South Australia, is the seat of the [[Government of South Australia]]. The [[bicameral]] [[Parliament of South Australia]] consists of the [[lower house]] known as the [[South Australian House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] and the [[upper house]] known as the [[South Australian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]]. [[South Australian state elections|General elections]] are held every four years, the last being the [[2022 South Australian state election]].

As Adelaide is South Australia's capital and most populous city, the [[Government of South Australia|State Government]] co-operates extensively with the [[City of Adelaide]]. In 2006, the Ministry for the City of Adelaide was created to facilitate the State Government's collaboration with the [[Adelaide City Council]] and the Lord Mayor to improve Adelaide's image. The State Parliament's Capital City Committee is also involved in the governance of the City of Adelaide, being primarily concerned with the planning of Adelaide's urban development and growth.<ref>[https://www.dpc.sa.gov.au/responsibilities/intergovernmental-relations/capital-city-committee Capital City Committee] Government of South Australia, 
Department of the Premier and Cabinet. Retrieved 23 July 2021.</ref>

Reflecting South Australia's status as Australia's most centralised state, Adelaide elects a substantial majority of the South Australian House of Assembly. Of the 47 seats in the chamber, 34 seats (three-quarters of the legislature) are based in Adelaide, and two rural seats include Adelaide suburbs.

=== Local governments ===

{{Further|Local government areas of South Australia}}
	 
The Adelaide metropolitan area is divided between nineteen [[Local Government Areas of South Australia|local government areas]]. At its centre, the [[City of Adelaide]] administers the [[Adelaide city centre]], [[North Adelaide]], and the surrounding [[Adelaide Parklands]]. It is the oldest municipal authority in Australia and was established in 1840, when Adelaide and Australia's first mayor, [[James Hurtle Fisher]], was elected. From 1919 onwards, the city has had a [[List of Mayors and Lord Mayors of Adelaide|Lord Mayor]], the current being Lord Mayor ''The Right Honourable'' [[Jane Lomax-Smith]].

While established as a [[British colonisation of South Australia|British province]], and very much English in terms of its culture, Adelaide attracted immigrants from other parts of Europe early on, including German and other European non-conformists escaping religious persecution. The first [[German Australians#Old Lutherans|German Lutherans arrived in 1838]],<ref>Monteath, P., Paul, M., & Martin, R. (2014): ''Interned: Torrens Island 1914–1915'', Wakefield Press, {{ISBN|9781743053386}} p. 8</ref> bringing with them the [[vine cuttings]] that they used to found the acclaimed wineries of the [[Barossa Valley]].

The [[Royal Adelaide Show]] is an annual [[agricultural show]] and [[state fair]], established in 1839 and now a huge event held in the [[Adelaide Showground]] annually.

Adelaide's arts scene flourished in the 1960s and 1970s with the support of successive premiers from both major political parties. The renowned [[Adelaide Festival of Arts]] was established in 1960 under Thomas Playford, which in the same year spawned an unofficial uncurated series of performances and exhibits which grew into the [[Adelaide Fringe]]. Construction of the [[Adelaide Festival Centre]] began under Steele Hall in 1970 and was completed under the subsequent government of [[Don Dunstan]], who also established the [[South Australian Film Corporation]] in 1972 and the [[State Opera of South Australia]] in 1976.

Over time, the Adelaide Festival expanded to include [[Adelaide Writers' Week]] and [[WOMADelaide]], and other separate festivals were established, such as the [[Adelaide Cabaret Festival]] (2002), the [[Adelaide Festival of Ideas]] (1999), the [[Adelaide Film Festival]] (2013), [[Feast Festival|FEAST]] (1999, a [[LGBT culture|queer culture]]), [[Tasting Australia]] (1997, a food and wine affair), and [[Illuminate Adelaide]] (2021). With the Festival, the Fringe, WOMADelaide, Writers' Week and the [[Adelaide 500]] street motor racing event (along with evening music concerts) all happening in early March, the period became known colloquially as "Mad March".

In 2014, [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] founded the [[Adelaide Language Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/alf/|title=Adelaide Language Festival 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310023446/http://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/alf/|archive-date=10 March 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lcnau2017.org/adelaide-languages-festival|title=Adelaide Language Festival, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909142218/https://www.lcnau2017.org/adelaide-languages-festival|archive-date=9 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

There are many international cultural fairs, most notably the German [[Schützenfest (Adelaide)|Schützenfest]] and Greek [[Glendi]]. Adelaide holds an annual [[Adelaide Christmas Pageant|Christmas pageant]], the world's largest [[Santa Claus parade|Christmas parade]].
[[File:Palm House, Adelaide Botanic Gardens.jpg|thumb|Palm House at the [[Adelaide Botanic Garden]]]]

=== North Terrace institutions ===
As the state capital, Adelaide has a great number of cultural institutions, many of them along the boulevard of [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]]. The [[Art Gallery of South Australia]], with about 35,000 works, holds Australia's second largest state-based collection. Adjacent are the [[South Australian Museum]] and [[State Library of South Australia]]. The [[Adelaide Botanic Garden]], [[National Wine Centre]] and [[Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute]] are nearby in the [[East End, Adelaide|East End]] of the city. In the back of the State Library lies the [[Migration Museum, Adelaide|Migration Museum]], Australia's oldest museum of its kind.

Further west, the [[Lion Arts Centre]] is home to [[ACE Open]], which showcases contemporary art; [[Dance Hub SA]]; and other studios and arts industry spaces. The [[Mercury Cinema]] and the [[JamFactory]] ceramics and design gallery are just around the corner.

The Adelaide Festival Centre (which includes the Dunstan Playhouse, Festival Theatre and Space Theatre), on the banks of the Torrens, is the focal point for much of the cultural activity in the city and home to the [[State Theatre Company of South Australia]]. Other live music and theatre venues include the [[Adelaide Entertainment Centre]]; [[Adelaide Oval]]; [[Memorial Drive Park]]; [[Thebarton Theatre]]; [[Adelaide Town Hall]]; [[Her Majesty's Theatre, Adelaide|Her Majesty's Theatre]]; [[Queen's Theatre, Adelaide|Queen's Theatre]]; [[Holden Theatres]]; and the Hopgood Theatre.

The [[Lion Arts Factory]], within the Lion Arts Centre, hosts contemporary music in a wide range of genres, as does "[[The Gov]]" in [[Hindmarsh, South Australia|Hindmarsh]]. The city also has numerous smaller theatres, pubs and cabaret bars which host performances.

In addition to its own [[WOMAD]] ([[WOMADelaide]]), Adelaide has attracted several touring music festivals, including [[Creamfields Australia|Creamfields]], [[St Jerome's Laneway Festival|Laneway]], and [[Groovin' the Moo|Groovin']] (some since defunct).

Adelaide has produced musical groups and individuals who have achieved national and international fame. These include the [[Adelaide Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Adelaide Youth Orchestra]], rock bands [[The Angels (Australian band)|The Angels]], [[Atlas Genius]], [[Cold Chisel]], [[The Superjesus]], [[Wolf & Cub]], roots/blues group [[The Audreys]], internationally acclaimed metal acts [[I Killed The Prom Queen]] and [[Double Dragon (band)|Double Dragon]], popular Australian hip-hop outfit [[Hilltop Hoods]], as well as Aussie Rules legend/rapper Chris Rodger, moniker (Chrissy Boiyo), to pop acts like [[Sia]], [[Orianthi]], [[Guy Sebastian]], and [[Wes Carr]], as well as internationally successful tribute act, The [[Australian Pink Floyd Show]].

Noted rocker [[Jimmy Barnes]] (formerly lead vocalist with Cold Chisel) spent most of his youth in the northern suburb of [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]].

The main sports played professionally in Adelaide are [[Australian Rules football]], soccer, [[cricket]], [[netball]], and basketball. Adelaide is the home of two [[Australian Football League]] teams: the [[Adelaide Football Club]] and [[Port Adelaide Football Club]], and one [[A-League]] soccer team, [[Adelaide United]]. A local [[Australian rules football]] league, the [[South Australian National Football League]] (SANFL), is made up of 10 teams from around Adelaide. The SANFL has been in operation since 1877 when it began as the South Australian Football Association (SAFA) before changing its name to the SANFL in 1927. The [[South Australian National Football League|SANFL]] is the oldest surviving football league of any code played in Australia.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Since completion of the upgrade, home games for Adelaide Crows and Port Adelaide now take place at Adelaide Oval.

Since 1884, [[Adelaide Oval]] has also hosted an international cricket test every summer, along with a number of [[One Day International]] cricket matches. [[Memorial Drive Park]], adjacent to the Adelaide Oval, used to host Davis Cup and other major tennis events, including the Australian Open and the Adelaide International. Adelaide's professional association football team, [[Adelaide United FC|Adelaide United]], play in the [[A-League Men|A-League]]. Founded in 2003, their home ground is [[Hindmarsh Stadium|Coopers Stadium]], which has a capacity of 16,500 and is one of the few [[Soccer-specific stadium|purpose-built soccer stadia]] in Australia. Prior to United's foundation, [[Adelaide City FC|Adelaide City]] and [[West Adelaide SC|West Adelaide]] represented the city in the [[National Soccer League]]. The two sides, which contest the [[Adelaide derby]] against one another, now play in the [[National Premier Leagues South Australia]].

For two years, 1997 and 1998, Adelaide was represented in Australia's top level [[rugby league]], after the [[New South Wales Rugby League]] had played a single game per season at the Adelaide Oval for five years starting in 1991.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/venues/adelaide-oval/results.html |title=Rugby League Project – Adelaide Oval |access-date=1 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201212057/http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/venues/adelaide-oval/results.html |archive-date=1 December 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Adelaide Rams]] were formed and played in the breakaway [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] (SL) competition in [[1997 Super League (Australia) season|1997]] before moving to the new [[National Rugby League]] in [[1998 NRL season|1998]]. Initially playing at the Adelaide Oval, the club moved to the more suitable Hindmarsh Stadium late in the 1998 season. As part of a peace deal with the [[Australian Rugby League]] to end the [[Super League war]], the club's owners [[News Limited]] (who were also owners of the SL) suddenly closed the club only weeks before the start of the [[1999 NRL season|1999 season]].

Adelaide has two professional basketball teams, the men's team being the [[Adelaide 36ers]] which plays in the [[National Basketball League (Australasia)|National Basketball League]] (NBL) and the women's team, the [[Adelaide Lightning]] which plays in the [[Women's National Basketball League]] (WNBL). The Adelaide 36ers play at the [[Adelaide Entertainment Centre]] while the Adelaide Lightning play at the [[Adelaide Arena]] (Previously Titanium Security Arena). Adelaide has a professional [[netball]] team, the [[Adelaide Thunderbirds]], which plays in the national netball competition, the [[Suncorp Super Netball]] championship, with home games played at [[Netball SA Stadium]]. The Thunderbirds occasionally play games or finals at the Titanium Security Arena, while international netball matches are usually played at the 10,500 seat Adelaide Entertainment Centre. The Titanium Security Arena has a capacity of 8,000 and is the largest purpose-built basketball stadium in Australia.

The [[Australian Grand Prix]] for World Championship [[Formula One]] racing was hosted by Adelaide from [[1985 Australian Grand Prix|1985]] to [[1995 Australian Grand Prix|1995]] on the [[Adelaide Street Circuit]] which was laid out in the city's East End as well as the eastern parklands including the [[Victoria Park, Adelaide|Victoria Park Racecourse]].<ref name="f1-move">{{cite web|title=Adelaide Street Circuit |publisher=Formula 1 Database |url=http://www.f1db.com/f1/page/Adelaide_Street_Circuit |access-date=13 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011110633/https://www.f1db.com/f1/page/Adelaide_Street_Circuit |archive-date=11 October 2007  }}</ref> The Grand Prix became a source of pride, and losing the event to Melbourne in a surprise announcement in mid-1993 left a void that has since been filled with the [[Adelaide 500]] for [[Supercars Championship|V8 Supercar]] racing, held on a modified version of the same street circuit. The Classic Adelaide, a [[rallying|rally]] of classic sporting vehicles, is also held in the city and its surrounds.

Adelaide formerly had three horse racing venues. [[Victoria Park, Adelaide|Victoria Park]], [[Cheltenham Park Racecourse]], both of which have now closed, and [[Morphettville Racecourse]] that remains the home of the [[South Australian Jockey Club]]. It also has [[Globe Derby Park (harness racing)|Globe Derby Park]] for [[Harness racing]] that opened in 1969, and by 1973 had become Adelaide's premier harness racing venue taking over from the [[Adelaide Showgrounds|Wayville Showgrounds]], as well as [[Greyhound Park]] for [[greyhound racing]] that opened in 1972.

The [[World Solar Challenge]] race attracts teams from around the world, most of which are fielded by universities or corporations, although some are fielded by high schools. The race has a 20-years' history spanning nine races, with the inaugural event taking place in 1987. Adelaide hosted the 2012 World Bowls Championships<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldbowls2012.com/ |title=2012 World Bowls Championships  |website=Worldbowls2012.com |access-date=11 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105120813/http://www.worldbowls2012.com/ |archive-date=5 November 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> at Lockleys Bowling Club, becoming the third city in the world to have held the championships twice, having previously hosted the event in 1996.

[[Dirt track racing|Dirt track speedway]] is also popular in Adelaide with three operating speedways. [[Adelaide Motorsport Park]], located adjacent to the [[Adelaide International Raceway]] road racing circuit at [[Virginia, South Australia|Virginia]] ({{convert|24|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the city centre) has been in continuous operation since 1979 after the closure of the popular [[Rowley Park Speedway]]. [[Gillman Speedway]] located in the semi-industrial suburb of [[Gillman, South Australia|Gillman]], has been in operation since 1998 and caters to [[Motorcycle speedway]] and [[Sidecar speedway|Sidecars]], while the [[Sidewinders Speedway]] located in [[Wingfield, South Australia|Wingfield]] is also a motorcycle speedway dedicated to Under-16 riders and has been in operation since 1978.

In 2016, backed by South Australia's [[Peregrine Corporation]] opened up a multi-purpose facility; a state-of-the-art motorsporting park and a hotel alongside its newer OTR service station outside a small township of [[Tailem Bend]] currently named [[The Bend Motorsport Park]].

=== Transport ===
{{Main|Transport in Adelaide}}

[[File:TransAdelaideRailwayMap.svg|thumb|A map of Adelaide's railway and tram network, served by the [[Adelaide Metro]].]]

Being centrally located on the Australian mainland, Adelaide forms a strategic transport hub for east–west and north–south routes. The city itself has a metropolitan public transport system managed by and known as the [[Adelaide Metro]]. The Adelaide Metro consists of a contracted bus system including the [[O-Bahn Busway]], [[Railways in Adelaide|7 commuter rail lines]] (diesel and electric), and a small tram network operating between inner suburb [[Hindmarsh, South Australia|Hindmarsh]], the city centre, and seaside [[Glenelg tram line|Glenelg]]. Tramways were largely dismantled in the 1950s, but saw a revival in the 2010s with upgrades and extensions.

Road transport in Adelaide has historically been easier than many of the other Australian cities, with a well-defined city layout and wide multiple-lane roads from the beginning of its development. Adelaide was known as a "twenty-minute city", with commuters having been able to travel from metropolitan outskirts to the city proper in roughly twenty minutes. However, such arterial roads often experience traffic congestion as the city grows.<ref>{{cite web|title=Metro Malcontent – The Twenty Minute City No More |work=Royal Automobile Association, South Australia |year=2005 |url=http://www.raa.net/download.asp?file=documents\document_677.pdf |access-date=28 December 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115022910/http://www.raa.net/download.asp?file=documents%5Cdocument_677.pdf |archive-date=15 January 2009  }} (1.18MB)</ref>

The Adelaide metropolitan area has one freeway and four expressways. In order of construction, they are:
* The [[South Eastern Freeway]] (M1), connects the south-east corner of the Adelaide Plain to the Adelaide Hills and beyond to [[Murray Bridge, South Australia|Murray Bridge]] and [[Tailem Bend]], where it then continues as National Highway 1 south-east to Melbourne.
* The [[Southern Expressway (Australia)|Southern Expressway]] (M2), connecting the outer southern suburbs with the inner southern suburbs and the city centre. It duplicates the route of [[South Road]].
* The [[North-South Motorway]] (M2), is an ongoing major project that will become the major north–south corridor, replacing most of what is now [[South Road]], connecting the [[Southern Expressway (Adelaide)|Southern Expressway]] and the [[Northern Expressway]] via a motorway with no traffic lights. As of 2024 the motorway's northern half is complete, connecting the Northern Expressway to Adelaide's inner north-west; the section running through Adelaide's inner west and inner south-west will begin major construction in 2025 with completion estimated for 2031.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About construction - River Torrens to Darlington - Department for Infrastructure and Transport |url=https://www.t2d.sa.gov.au/construction/about-construction |access-date=2024-06-28 |website=www.t2d.sa.gov.au |language=en}}</ref>
* The [[Port River Expressway]] (A9), connects Port Adelaide and [[Outer Harbor, South Australia|Outer Harbor]] to Port Wakefield Road at the northern "entrance" to the metropolitan area.
* The [[Northern Expressway]] (Max Fatchen Expressway) (M2), is the northern suburbs bypass route connecting the Sturt Highway (National Highway 20) via the [[Gawler Bypass]] to Port Wakefield Road at a point a few kilometres north of the Port River Expressway connection.
* The [[Northern Connector]], completed in 2020, links the North South Motorway to the Northern Expressway.

The Adelaide metropolitan area has two commercial airports, [[Adelaide Airport]] and [[Parafield Airport]]. Adelaide Airport, in Adelaide's south-western suburbs, serves in excess of 8 million passengers annually.<ref name="Adelaide Airport">{{cite web|url=http://www.adelaideairport.com.au/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/nr-8-million-pax-01.17-v2.pdf|title=Adelaide Airport reaches 8 million passengers in 2016|date=16 January 2017|publisher=Adelaide Airport Ltd. media release|access-date=23 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320061749/http://www.adelaideairport.com.au/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/nr-8-million-pax-01.17-v2.pdf|archive-date=20 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Parafield Airport, Adelaide's second airport {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=off}} north of the city centre, is used for small aircraft, pilot training and recreational aviation purposes. Parafield Airport served as Adelaide's main aerodrome until the opening of the Adelaide Airport in February 1955. Adelaide Airport serves many international and domestic destinations including all Australian state capitals.

Adelaide is also home to a military airport, known as [[RAAF Base Edinburgh|Edinburgh Airport]], located in the northern suburbs. It was built in 1955 in a joint initiative with the United Kingdom for weapon development.

=== Health ===
[[File:North Terrace's BioMed precinct at night.jpg|thumb|right|The [[University of Adelaide]] Health and Medical Sciences Building, located in the BioMed City precinct on North Terrace.]]

Adelaide's two largest hospitals are the [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]] (RAH) in Adelaide Parklands, a [[teaching hospital]] affiliated with the University of Adelaide (800 beds), and the [[Flinders Medical Centre]] (580 beds) at Bedford Park, affiliated with Flinders University. The RAH also operates additional campuses for specialist care throughout the suburbs including the Hampstead Rehabilitation Centre (150 beds) at [[Northfield, South Australia|Northfield]] and the [[Glenside Hospital (Adelaide)|Glenside Campus]] (129 beds) for acute mental health services.

Other major public hospitals are the [[Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide|Women's and Children's Hospital]] (305 beds), at North Adelaide; the [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Adelaide|Queen Elizabeth Hospital]] (340 beds) at Woodville; [[Modbury Hospital]] (178 beds) at Modbury; and the [[Lyell McEwin Hospital]] (198 beds) at Elizabeth Vale. Numerous private hospitals are also located throughout the city, with the largest operators being not-for-profits [[Adelaide Community Healthcare Alliance]] (3 hospitals) and [[Sisters of the Little Company of Mary|Calvary Care]] (4 hospitals).

In 2017, the RAH was relocated from the city's [[East End, Adelaide|East End]] to a new AU$2.3&nbsp;billion facility built over former railyards in the West End.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sexton |first=Mike |title = New Royal Adelaide Hospital: All you need to know about the delayed high-tech project |newspaper=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=1 February 2017 |url = https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-24/new-royal-adelaide-hospital-all-you-need-to-know/8206416 |access-date=26 August 2019 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190821201512/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-24/new-royal-adelaide-hospital-all-you-need-to-know/8206416 |archive-date=21 August 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The state-of-the-art hospital forms part of a new biomedical precinct called [[BioMed City]] that collocates the [[South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute]] (SAHMRI), the University of Adelaide Health and Medical Sciences building, the University of South Australia's Health Innovation Building, and the state's Dental Hospital.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sahealth.sa.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/public+content/sa+health+internet/health+reform/the+new+royal+adelaide+hospital/south+australian+health+and+biomedical+precinct/south+australian+health+and+biomedical+precinct |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140707091617/http://www.sahealth.sa.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/public+content/sa+health+internet/health+reform/the+new+royal+adelaide+hospital/south+australian+health+and+biomedical+precinct/south+australian+health+and+biomedical+precinct |url-status= dead |archive-date= 7 July 2014 |title=South Australian Health and Biomedical Precinct }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sahealth.sa.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/public+content/sa+health+internet/health+services/dental+services/adelaide+dental+hospital/new+adelaide+dental+hospital |title=New Adelaide Dental Hospital :: SA Health |access-date=4 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904204107/http://www.sahealth.sa.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/public+content/sa+health+internet/health+services/dental+services/adelaide+dental+hospital/new+adelaide+dental+hospital |archive-date=4 September 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> SAHMRI is building a $300&nbsp;million second facility due to be completed by 2022 to house the [[Australian Bragg Centre for Proton Therapy and Research|Australian Bragg Centre]] with Australia's first [[proton therapy]] unit.<ref name="SAHMRI 2">{{cite web |title=SAHMRI 2 |url=http://www.commercialgeneral.com.au/projects/sahmri-2/ |website=Commercial & General |access-date=26 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190318203100/https://www.commercialgeneral.com.au/projects/sahmri-2/ |archive-date=18 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Construction is underway for the [[Women's and Children's Hospital]] to be relocated to the precinct adjacent the RAH by 2030.<ref name="NWMAC">{{Cite web |last=Network |first=Women's and Children's Health |title=About the Project |url=https://www.newwch.sa.gov.au/about-the-project |access-date=2024-06-28 |website=New Women’s and Children’s Hospital Project |language=en-AU}}</ref>

Privatisation led to competition from a variety of companies who now separately provide for the generation, transmission, distribution and retail sales of gas and electricity. Electricity generation comes from a range of technologies and operators. [[ElectraNet]] operates the high-voltage electricity transmission network. [[SA Power Networks]] distributes electricity to end users. The largest electricity and gas retailing companies are also the largest generating companies.

The largest fossil fuel power stations are the [[Torrens Island Power Station]] gas-fired plant operated by [[AGL Energy]] and the [[Pelican Point Power Station]] operated by [[Engie]].

=== Water ===

[[File:Happy Valley Reservoir 20070223.jpg|thumb|An aerial view of [[Happy Valley Reservoir]], 2007]]

The provision of water services is by the government-owned [[SA Water]]. Adelaide's water is supplied from its seven reservoirs: [[Mount Bold Reservoir|Mount Bold]], [[Happy Valley Reservoir|Happy Valley]], [[Myponga Reservoir|Myponga]], [[Millbrook Reservoir|Millbrook]], [[Hope Valley Reservoir|Hope Valley]], [[Little Para Reservoir|Little Para]] and [[South Para Reservoir|South Para]]. The yield from these reservoir catchments can be as little as 10% of the city's requirements (90GL per annum<ref name=desal />) in drought years and about 60% in average years. The remaining demand is met by the pumping of water from the [[River Murray]].<ref name=desal />

A [[Adelaide Desalination Plant|sea-water desalination plant]] capable of supplying 100GL per annum was built during the [[2000s Australian drought|2001–2009 drought]]; however, it operated at about 8% of its capacity until 2019.
