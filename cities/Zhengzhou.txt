The site is generally identified with the Shang capital of Ao and is preserved in the Shang dynasty Ruins monument in Guanchen District.

The Shang, who continually moved their capital due to frequent natural disasters, left Ao at around 13th century BC. The site, nevertheless, remained occupied; [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] (post-1050 BC) tombs have also been discovered.<ref name="zzst">{{Cite book|trans-title=Zhengzhou Region Historical Records Committee Compilation |script-title=zh:郑州市地方史志编纂委员会 |language=zh|publisher=Zhongzhou Antiquarina Book Publishing ({{lang|zh|中州古籍出版社}})|year=1999|isbn=7-5348-1869-9}}</ref> Legend suggests that in the Western Zhou period (1111–771 BC) the site became the fief of a family named ''[[Guan (state)|Guan]]''. From this derives the name borne by the county (''[[County (People's Republic of China)|xian]]'') since the late 6th century BC—[[Guancheng Hui District|Guancheng]] (City of the Guan). The city first became the seat of a prefectural administration in AD 587, when it was named ''Guanzhou''. In 605 it was first called Zhengzhou—a name by which it has been known virtually ever since.<ref name="shangduw">{{cite web|url=http://cul.shangdu.com/xingyin/20090225-18744/index.shtml|script-title=zh:隞都郑州与郑州小双桥遗址|language=zh|access-date=26 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403133035/http://cul.shangdu.com/xingyin/20090225-18744/index.shtml|archive-date=3 April 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The name Zhengzhou came from the [[Sui dynasty]] (AD 582), even though it was located in Chenggao, another town. The government moved to the contemporary city during the [[Tang dynasty]]. It achieved its greatest importance under the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] (AD 581–618), [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] (618–907), and early [[Song dynasty|Song]] (960–1127) dynasties, when it was the terminus of the [[New Bian Canal]], which joined the [[Yellow River]] to the northwest. There, at a place called Heyin, a vast granary complex was established to supply the capitals at [[Luoyang]] and [[Chang'an]] to the west and the frontier armies to the north. In the Song period, however, the transfer of the capital eastward to [[Kaifeng]] robbed Zhengzhou of much of its importance.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

In 1903 the [[Beijing]]–[[Hankou]] Railway arrived at Zhengzhou, and in 1909 the first stage of the [[Longhai Railway]] gave it an east–west link to Kaifeng and Luoyang; it later was extended eastward to the coast at [[Lianyungang]], [[Jiangsu]], and westward to [[Xi'an]] ([[Chang'an]]), [[Shaanxi]], as well as to western Shaanxi. Zhengzhou thus became a major rail junction and a regional center for cotton, grain, [[peanut]]s, and other agricultural produce. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Early in 1923 a workers' strike began in Zhengzhou and spread along the rail line before it was suppressed; a 14-story double tower in the center of the city commemorates the strike. On 10 June 1938, Chiang Kai-shek's [[National Revolutionary Army]] opened up the dikes retaining the Yellow River at Huayuankou between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, in an effort to stem the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|tide of invading Japanese]]; however, the ensuing [[1938 Yellow River flood]] also killed hundreds of thousands of Chinese.<ref>{{cite book|title=History Should Not Be Forgotten|first=Israel|last=Epstein|publisher=China Intercontinental Press|year=2005|isbn=978-7-5085-0694-4|page=70}}</ref>

Zhengzhou also has a [[locomotive]] and [[rolling-stock]] repair plant, a tractor-assembly plant, and a thermal generating station. The city's industrial growth has resulted in a large increase in the population, coming predominantly from industrial workers from the north. A water diversion project and pumping station, built in 1972, has provided [[irrigation]] for the surrounding countryside. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=李克实 |title=南水魂：南水北调中线工程渠首建设纪实 |date=March 2016 |publisher=Beijing Book Co.

==Geography==

Located just north of the province's centre and south of the [[Yellow River]], Zhengzhou borders [[Luoyang]] to the west, [[Jiaozuo]] to the northwest, [[Xinxiang]] to the northeast, [[Kaifeng]] to the east, [[Xuchang]] to the southeast, and [[Pingdingshan]] to the southwest. With the land within its administrative borders generally sloping down from west to east, Zhengzhou is situated at the transitional zone between the [[North China Plain]] to the east and the [[Song Mountains]] and [[Xionger Mountains]] to the west, which are part of the greater [[Qin Mountains|Qinling]] range. The city centre is situated to the south of the middle reach of the Yellow River, where its valley broadens into the great plain. Zhengzhou is at the crossing point of the north–south route skirting the [[Taihang Mountains]] and the mountains of western Henan. The prefecture spans 34° 16' ~ 34° 58 N latitude and 112° 42' ~ 114° 14' E longitude, covering a total area of {{convert|7567|sqkm}}, including the metropolitan area, which covers {{convert|1284.89|sqkm|1|abbr=on}}, and the city centre, which occupies {{convert|709.69|sqkm|1}}.<ref>{{Cite web |title=郑州市_行政区划_河南省人民政府门户网站 |url=https://www.henan.gov.cn/2006/09-08/231049.html?wscckey=4a54a82c1a8fcd84_1576379098 |access-date=31 January 2023 |website=www.henan.gov.cn}}</ref>

[[File:Jialu River in Huiji District, Zhengzhou 2020050501.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jialu River]], a tributary of the [[Huai River]], flows through Zhengzhou]]
A section of the Yellow River passes by the northern edges of the urban area, extending {{convert|150.4|km|abbr=on}} within Zhengzhou prefecture. However, [[Jialu River]], a secondary tributary of the [[Huai River]], is Zhengzhou's main urban river and flood channel.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=Kaize |last2=Shen |first2=Qujin |last3=Han |first3=Han |last4=Jia |first4=Yizhen |title=Urban River Health Analysis of the Jialu River in Zhengzhou City Using the Improved Fuzzy Matter-Element Extension Model |journal=Water |date=2019 |volume=11 |issue=6 |page=1190 |doi=10.3390/w11061190|doi-access=free }}</ref> The Jialu enters Zhengzhou from [[Xinmi]] to the southwest, and turns to the southeast within the city. Mountains loom over the western counties of [[Gongyi]] and [[Dengfeng]] while the easternmost county of [[Zhongmu County|Zhongmu]] is a vast, fertile floodplain, with the counties in between being hilly transitions.

===Climate===
Zhengzhou experiences a monsoon-influenced, four-season [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cwa''), with cool, dry winters and hot, humid summers. Spring and autumn are dry and somewhat abbreviated transition periods. The city has an annual mean temperature of {{convert|15.4|°C|1}}, with the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranging from {{convert|1.0|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|27.8|°C|1}} in July.<ref name="cma new">{{cite web

Rainfall is primarily produced by the [[East Asian monsoon|monsoonal low]] during summer; in winter, when the vast [[Siberian High]] dominates due to radiative cooling from further north, the area receives little precipitation. During the summer season, the city is also often affected by tropical depressions, which bring additional amounts of rain. The annual precipitation is about {{convert|630|mm}}. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 37&nbsp;percent in January to 49&nbsp;percent in April and May, the city receives 1,905 hours of sunshine per year, which is around 43% of the possible total.<ref name="cma new"/>

Zhengzhou was the capital of China during the [[Shang dynasty]]. Parts of the Shang-era capital city wall that were built 3,600 years ago still remain in Downtown Zhengzhou (see [[Zhengzhou Shang City]]).<ref name="shangduw" /> Zhengzhou maintains abundant cultural heritages that reflect its history as well as the culture of Henan Province. [[Zhengzhou Confucius Temple]], initially built during the Eastern Han dynasty 1900 years ago, is one of the oldest Confucian Temples in China. Other important architectural heritage sites in the city center include Town God Temple and [[Erqi Memorial Tower]].

One internationally known tourist attraction is the [[Shaolin Monastery]] (少林寺), which is in [[Dengfeng]], about {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} southwest of downtown Zhengzhou (1.5 hours by coach). The Shaolin Monastery is not only known as one of China's most important Buddhist shrines, but also as the ancient centre of Chinese [[Kung-fu]]. Shaolin Monastery and its famed [[Pagoda Forest at Shaolin Temple|Pagoda Forest]] were inscribed as a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://malaysia.news.yahoo.com/bnm/20100802/tts-china-heritage-993ba14.html|title=China's Shaolin Temple, Danxia Landform Added To World Heritage Sites}}{{Dead link|date=June 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
