==History==
This region has played a distinguished role in the [[History of Chile|history]] and [[culture of Chile]]. Many patriots who fought for [[Chilean War of Independence|independence]], [[President of Chile|presidents]], politicians, and artists, like pianist [[Claudio Arrau]] and folklorist [[Violeta Parra]], were born here.

On August 20, 2015, President [[Michelle Bachelet]] signed the bill that converted the [[Ñuble Province (1974-2018)|Ñuble Province]] into a [[Regions of Chile|Region]], and its legislative process began on the 1 September 2015, while on 10 January 2017, the project was approved in the first constitutional process in the Senate with 28 votes in favor and 2 against. The project was processed in the Chamber of Deputies, where it was approved and dispatched on July 5 of the same year On 12 July 2017 the project was approved by the Senate chamber, with 26 votes in favor and only 2 against.

For 2017, after approval in the National Congress, the deputy Marcelo Chávez sends this project to the Constitutional Court of Chile to consider three articles as unconstitutional: the proportionality with respect to the number of senators in the region, the regional councilors who are elected for the Biobío Region they would move to the new region and the lack of consultation with the indigenous peoples in the defense of the bill, Senator Felipe Harboe presented himself. The court approved the creation of the Ñuble Region on 2 August 2017 and on August 19 of the same year, the law is signed by President Michelle Bachelet at the Sport's House of Chillán. In September 2017 the law was published in the Official Gazette, with the stipulation that it would come into force until one year after its publication, e.g., 5 September 2018.

==Itata Valley wine region==

The '''Itata Valley''' is a wine region in southern [[Chile]] and a [[Denomination of Origin]] (DO) is defined by the Chilean [[Appellation]] system, the legally defined and protected geographical indication used to identify where the grapes for a wine were grown.
The valley is located in Ñuble, {{convert|420|km|mi|abbr=off}} from [[Santiago]], the capital of [[Chile]], and {{convert|65|km|mi|abbr=off}} of the major port of [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]]. It is the northernmost of Chile's three southern wine regions and stretches roughly {{convert|60|mi|km}} from north to south and a similar distance from east to west, but although it is extensive, it has a low density of vineyard plantations. The area is defined by the convergence of the [[Itata River|Itata]] and [[Ñuble River]]s, and vineyards plantations are mostly found around the towns of [[Chillan]], [[Quillon]] and [[Coelemu]]. The valley's western border is the [[Pacific Ocean]], which has a cooling influence over the valley due to the cold [[Humboldt current]] that runs along most of Chile's coastline.
The cool [[Mediterranean climate]] suits [[Pais]], [[Muscat of Alexandria]] and [[Carignan]] vines, and more recently, producers have begun to plant more modern grape varieties like [[Cabernet Sauvignon]].

The soils are alluvial, made up of sand and clay from the [[Itata River|Itata]] and [[Ñuble River|Ñuble]] rivers. The region is located at a latitude of 36°S, a similar distance from the [[Equator]] as southern Spain or the central valley of California.<ref>[http://www.wine-searcher.com/regions-itata+valley Itata Valley Wine] Published by Wine-Searcher.com | Last updated 02-Aug-2013 by Wine-Searcher Staff retrieved October 25, 2013</ref>
