Its capital is [[Bhopal]], and its largest city is [[Indore]], with [[Jabalpur]], [[Gwalior]] being the other major cities. Madhya Pradesh is the [[List of states and union territories of India by area|second largest Indian state by area]] and the [[List of states and union territories of India by population|fifth largest state by population]] with over 72&nbsp;million residents. It borders the states of [[Uttar Pradesh]] to the northeast, [[Chhattisgarh]] to the east, [[Maharashtra]] to the south, [[Gujarat]] to the west, and [[Rajasthan]] to the northwest.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://fsi.nic.in/cover_2011/madhyapradesh.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=30 October 2019 |archive-date=5 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200205231100/http://fsi.nic.in/cover_2011/madhyapradesh.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref>

The area covered by the present-day Madhya Pradesh includes the area of the ancient [[Avanti (India)|Avanti]] [[Mahajanapada]], whose capital [[Ujjain]] (also known as Avantika) arose as a major city during the second wave of Indian urbanisation in the sixth century BCE. Subsequently, the region was ruled by the major dynasties of India. The [[Maratha Confederacy|Maratha Empire]] dominated the majority of the 18th century. After the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]] in the 19th century, the region was divided into several [[princely states]] under the [[British Empire|British]] and incorporated into [[Central Provinces and Berar]] and the [[Central India Agency]]. Some years after India's independence, the [[Central Provinces and Berar]] was renamed as Madhya Pradesh with [[Nagpur]] as its capital: this state included the southern parts of the present-day Madhya Pradesh and northeastern portion of today's Maharashtra. In 1956, this state was [[States Reorganisation Act|reorganised]] and its parts were combined with the states of [[Madhya Bharat]], [[Vindhya Pradesh]] and [[Bhopal State (1949–56)|Bhopal]] to form the new Madhya Pradesh state, the Marathi-speaking [[Vidarbha]] region was removed and merged with the [[Bombay State]]. This state was the largest in India by area until 2000, when its southeastern Chhattisgarh region was designated a separate state.

The city of [[Ujjain]] arose as a major centre in the region, during the second wave of Indian urbanisation in the sixth century BCE. It has served as the capital of the [[Avanti (India)|Avanti kingdom]]. Other kingdoms mentioned in ancient epics{{snd}}[[Malava Kingdom|Malava]], [[Karusha Kingdom|Karusha]], [[Dasarna Kingdom|Dasarna]] and [[Nishada Kingdom|Nishada]]{{snd}}have also been identified with parts of Madhya Pradesh.

[[Chandragupta Maurya]] [[conquered]] northern [[India]] around 320 BCE, establishing the [[Mauryan Empire]], which included all of modern-day Madhya Pradesh. [[Ashoka]] the greatest of Mauryan rulers, [[conquered]] it, bringing the region under firmer control. After the decline of the Maurya empire, the region was contested among the [[Saka]]s, the [[Kushana]]s, the [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahanas]], and several local dynasties during the 1st to 3rd centuries CE. Heliodorus, the Greek Ambassador to the court of the Shunga King Bhagabhadra erected the [[Heliodorus pillar]] near Vidisha.

[[Ujjain]] emerged as the predominant commercial centre of western India from the {{CE|first century|link=y}}, located on the trade routes between the [[Ganges]] plain and India's [[Arabian Sea]] ports. The [[Satavahana]] dynasty of the northern [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] and the Saka dynasty of the [[Western Satraps]] fought for the control of Madhya Pradesh during the 1st to 3rd centuries CE.

The [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahana]] King [[Gautamiputra Satakarni]] inflicted a crushing defeat upon the [[Saka]] rulers and conquered parts of [[Malwa]] and [[Gujarat]] in the 2nd century CE.<ref>''Ancient India'' by Ramesh Chandra Majumdar: p. 134.</ref>

Subsequently, the region was [[conquered]] by the [[Gupta empire]] in the 4th and 5th centuries, and their southern neighbours, the [[Vakataka]]'s. The rock-cut temples at [[Bagh Caves]] in the Kukshi tehsil of the Dhar District show the presence of the Gupta dynasty in the region, supported by the testimony of a Badwani inscription dated to the year of 487 CE.<ref>Verma, Archana (2007). ''Cultural and Visual Flux at Early Historical Bagh in Central India'', Oxford: Archaeopress, {{ISBN|978-1-4073-0151-8}}, p. 19.</ref> The attacks of the [[Hephthalite]]s or [[White Huns]] brought about the collapse of the Gupta empire, which broke up into smaller states. The King [[Yasodharman]] of [[Malwa]] defeated the Huns in 528, ending their expansion. Later, [[Harsha]] (c. 590–647) ruled the northern parts of the [[States and union territories of India|state]]. [[Malwa]] was ruled by the south Indian [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty]] from the late 8th century to the 10th century.<ref>''A Journey through India's Past (Great Hindu Kings after Harshavardhana)'', by Chandra Mauli Mani: p. 13.</ref> When the south Indian Emperor [[Govinda III]] of the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty]] annexed Malwa, he set up the family of one of his subordinates there, who took the name of [[Paramara dynasty|Paramara]].<ref>''A Brief History of India'' by Alain Daniélou p. 185.</ref>

The Medieval period saw the rise of the [[Rajput]] clans, including the [[Paramara dynasty|Paramaras]] of [[Malwa]] and the [[Chandela]]s of [[Bundelkhand]] along with the [[Lodhi (caste)|Lodhis]]. The Chandellas built the majestic Hindu-Jain temples at [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments|Khajuraho]], which represent the culmination of Hindu temple architecture in Central India. The [[Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty]] also held sway in northern and western Madhya Pradesh at this time. It also left some monuments of architectural value in Gwalior. Southern parts of Madhya Pradesh like [[Malwa]] were several times invaded by the south Indian [[Western Chalukya Empire]] which imposed its rule on the Paramara kingdom of Malwa.<ref>''History of India'' by N. Jayapalan pp. 149–151.</ref> The Paramara King [[Bhoja]] (c. 1010–1060) was claimed to be a renowned [[polymath]]. The small Gond kingdoms emerged in the [[Gondwana (India)|Gondwana]] and [[Mahakoshal]] regions of the state. Northern Madhya Pradesh was conquered by the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Delhi Sultanate]] in the 13th century. After the collapse of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] at the end of the 14th century, independent regional kingdoms re-emerged, including the [[Tomaras of Gwalior|Tomara]] kingdom of [[Gwalior]] and the Muslim Sultanate of [[Malwa Sultanate|Malwa]], with its capital at [[Mandu, Madhya Pradesh|Mandu]].

The [[Malwa Sultanate]] was conquered by the [[Sultanate of Gujarat]] in 1531. In the 1540s, most parts of the state fell to [[Sher Shah Suri]], and subsequently to the [[Hindu king]] [[Hemu]]. Hemu, who had earlier served as the [[General]] of the [[Islamic]] [[Suri dynasty]], operated from the [[Gwalior Fort]] during 1553–56 and became the ruler of Delhi as a Vikramaditya king winning 22 battles continuously from Bengal to Gujrat and defeating Akbar's forces in the [[Battle of Tughlaqabad|Battle of Delhi]] on 7 October 1556. However, he chose Delhi as his capital after his formal Coronation and left Gwalior. After Hemu's defeat by [[Akbar]] at the [[Second Battle of Panipat]] in 1556, most of Madhya Pradesh came under the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule. Gondwana and Mahakoshal remained under the control of Gond kings, who acknowledged [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[suzerainty]] but enjoyed virtual [[autonomy]].

The Mughal control weakened considerably after the death of [[Emperor]] [[Aurangzeb]] in 1707. Between 1720 and 1760, the [[Marathas]] [[conquered]] most of Madhya Pradesh, resulting in the establishment of semi-autonomous states under the nominal control of the [[Peshwa]] of [[Pune]]: the [[House of Holkar|Holkar]]s of [[Indore]] ruled much of Malwa, [[Pawars]] ruled [[Dewas State (Maratha Confederacy)|Dewas]] and [[Dhar State|Dhar]], the [[Bhonsle]]s of [[Nagpur kingdom|Nagpur]] dominated Mahakoshal-Gondwana area, while the [[Scindia]]s of [[Gwalior State|Gwalior]] controlled the northern parts of the state. The most notable Maratha rulers of the region were [[Mahadji Shinde]], [[Ahilyabai Holkar]] and [[Yashwantrao Holkar]]. Besides these, there were several other [[:Category:Princely states of Madhya Pradesh|small states]], including [[Bhopal State|Bhopal]], [[Orchha State|Orchha]], and [[Rewa (princely state)|Rewa]]. The [[Bhopal state]], which paid [[tribute]] to both the [[Marathas]] and the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]], was founded by [[Dost Mohammad Khan, Nawab of Bhopal|Dost Mohammed Khan]], a former General in the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] army.

After the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]], the [[British Empire|British]] [[conquered]] the entire region. All the sovereign states in the region became [[princely state]]s of [[British India]], governed by the [[Central India Agency]]. The Mahakoshal region became a British province: the [[Saugor and Nerbudda Territories]]. In 1861, the British merged the [[Nagpur Province]] with the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories to form the [[Central Provinces]].

During the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|1857 uprising]], rebellions happened in the northern parts of the state, led by leaders like [[Tatya Tope]], [[Avantibai|Rani Avantibai Lodhi]]. However, these were crushed by the [[British Empire|British]] and the princes loyal to them. The state witnessed a number of anti-British activities and protests during the [[Indian independence movement]].<ref name="DwarkaPrasad1956">{{cite book |editor=Dwarka Prasad Misha |title=The History of freedom movement in Madhya Pradesh |year=1956 |publisher=Govt. Print., Madhya Pradesh}}</ref> Several notable leaders such as [[Chandra Shekhar Azad]], [[B. R. Ambedkar]], [[Shankar Dayal Sharma]], [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] and [[Arjun Singh (former politician)|Arjun Singh]] were born in what is now Madhya Pradesh.

After the independence of India, Madhya Pradesh was created in 1950 from the former British [[Central Provinces and Berar]] and the [[princely states]] of [[Makrai]] and Chhattisgarh, with [[Nagpur]] as the capital of the state. The new states of [[Madhya Bharat]], [[Vindhya Pradesh]], and [[Bhopal State (1949–56)|Bhopal]] were formed out of the Central India Agency. In 1956, the states of Madhya Bharat, [[Vindhya Pradesh]], and [[Bhopal]] were merged into Madhya Pradesh, and the [[Marathi language|Marathi]]-speaking southern region [[Vidarbha]], which included Nagpur, was ceded to [[Bombay state]]. [[Jabalpur]] was chosen to be the capital of the state but at the last moment, due to political interference [[Jabalpur]] sacrificed his place of Capital but then [[Bhopal]] was made the state capital.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sen |first=Abha |url=http://www.patrika.com/news/madhya-pradesh/that-s-why-jabalpur-could-not-make-capital-of-mp-3323/ |title=जबलपुर के हाथ से बस इसलिए निकल गई राजधानी की प्रबल दावेदारी |work=Patrika.com |access-date=25 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115083131/https://www.patrika.com/news/madhya-pradesh/that-s-why-jabalpur-could-not-make-capital-of-mp-3323/ |archive-date=15 November 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In November 2000, as part of the Madhya Pradesh Reorganization Act, the southeastern portion of the state split off to form the new state of [[Chhattisgarh]].

Madhya Pradesh literally means "Central Province", and is located in the geographic heart of India in between the latitude of 21.6°N–26.30°N and longitude of 74°9'E–82°48'E. The state straddles the [[Narmada River]], which runs east and west between the [[Vindhya Range|Vindhya]] and [[Satpura Range|Satpura]] ranges; these ranges and the Narmada are the traditional boundaries between the north and south of India. The highest point in Madhya Pradesh is [[Dhupgarh]], with an elevation of 1,350&nbsp;m (4,429&nbsp;ft).<ref>{{cite book

=== Climate ===
Madhya Pradesh also has three major seasons – Summer, Monsoon, and Winter. During summer (March–June), the temperature in the entire state ranges above 34.6 it has increased as it is all-time high in Madhya Pradesh. In general, the eastern parts of Madhya Pradesh are hotter than the western parts. The regions like Gwalior, Morena and Datia record temperatures of over 42&nbsp;°C in May. The humidity is relatively very low and the region usually experiences frequent mild dust storms. The southwest Monsoon usually breaks out in mid-June and the entire state receives a major share of its rainfall between June and September. The south and south-east regions tend to experience a higher rainfall whereas the parts of the north-west receive less. Jabalpur, Mandla, Balaghat, Sidhi, and other extreme eastern parts receive more than 150&nbsp;cm of rainfall. The districts of western Madhya Pradesh receive less than 80&nbsp;cm of rainfall.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://mp.gov.in/state-profile |title=Government of Madhya Pradesh (M.P.) |access-date=9 June 2021 |archive-date=9 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210609142930/https://mp.gov.in/state-profile |url-status=live}}</ref>

The winter season starts in November. The temperature remains low in the northern parts of the state in comparison to the southern parts. The daily maximum temperature in most of the northern part of January remains between 15 and 18&nbsp;°C. The climate is generally dry and pleasant with a clear sky. The average rainfall is about {{convert|1194|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The southeastern districts have the heaviest rainfall, some places receiving as much as {{convert|2150|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, while the western and northwestern districts receive {{convert|1000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} or less.

=== Ecology ===
According to the 2011 figures, the recorded forest area of the state is {{convert|94689|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} constituting 30.7% of the geographical area of the state.<ref name="FSI_2011">{{cite book |title=State of Forest Report |year=2011 |publisher=Forest Survey of India (Ministry of Environment & Forests) |url=http://www.fsi.org.in/cover_2011/madhyapradesh.pdf |access-date=10 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512234452/http://www.fsi.org.in/cover_2011/madhyapradesh.pdf |archive-date=12 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It constitutes 12.3% of the forest area of India. Legally this area has been classified into "Reserved Forest" (65.3%), "Protected Forest" (32.8%) and "Unclassified Forest" (0.2%). Per capita forest area is {{convert|2400|m2|acre|2|abbr=on}} as against the national average of {{convert|700|m2|acre|2|abbr=on}}. The forest cover is less dense in the northern and western parts of the state, which contain the major urban centres. Variability in climatic and [[edaphic]] conditions brings about significant difference in the forest types of the state. In January 2019 1.5&nbsp;million volunteers in the state planted 66&nbsp;million trees in 12 hours along the [[Narmada River|Narmada river]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/india-plant-66-million-trees-12-hours-environment-campaign-madhya-pradesh-global-warming-climate-a7820416.html |title=India planted 66 million trees in 12 hours |date=3 July 2017 |website=The Independent |language=en |access-date=5 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207080825/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/india-plant-66-million-trees-12-hours-environment-campaign-madhya-pradesh-global-warming-climate-a7820416.html |archive-date=7 February 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The major types of soils found in the state are:
* Black soil, most predominantly in the [[Malwa]] region, [[Mahakoshal]] and in southern [[Bundelkhand]]
* Red and yellow soil, in the [[Baghelkhand]] region
* Alluvial soil, in Northern Madhya Pradesh

The [[Narmada River|Narmada]] is the longest river in Madhya Pradesh. It flows westward through a rift valley, with the Vindhya ranges sprawling along its northern bank and the Satpura range of mountains along the southern. Its tributaries include the Banjar, the [[Tawa River|Tawa]], the [[Machna]], the [[Shakkar River|Shakkar]], the [[Denwa]] and the [[Sonbhadra]] rivers. The [[Tapti River]] runs parallel to Narmada, and also flows through a rift valley. The Narmada–Tapti systems carry an enormous volume of water and provide drainage for almost a quarter of the land area of Madhya Pradesh. The Narmada river is considered very sacred and is worshipped throughout the region. It is the main source of water and acts as a lifeline to the state.

The [[Vindhyas]] form the southern boundary of the Ganges basin, with the western part of the Ganges basin draining into the [[Yamuna]] and the eastern part directly into the Ganges itself. All the rivers, which drain into the Ganges, flow from south to north, with the [[Chambal River|Chambal]], [[Shipra River|Shipra]], [[Kali Sindh River|Kali Sindh]], [[Parbati River (Madhya Pradesh)|Parbati]], [[Kuno River|Kuno]], [[Sind River|Sind]], [[Betwa River|Betwa]], [[Dhasan River|Dhasan]], [[Ken River|Ken]] and [[Sunar River|Sunar]]rivers being the main tributaries of the Yamuna. Shipra River is one of the most sacred rivers of Hinduism. It is the site of the [[Ujjain Simhastha|Simhastha Kumbh Mela]], which is held every 12 years. Shipra is stretched across Indore, Ujjain and Dewas. The land drained by these rivers is agriculturally rich, with the natural vegetation largely consisting of grass and [[dry deciduous forest]] types, largely thorny. The eastern part of the Ganges basin consists of the [[Son River|Son]], the [[Tons River|Tons]] and the [[Rihand]] Rivers. Son, which arises in the Maikal hills around [[Amarkantak]], is the largest tributary that goes into the Ganges on the south bank and that does not arise from the [[Himalayas]]. Son and its tributaries contribute the bulk of the monsoon flow into the Ganges, because the north bank tributaries are all snow fed. The forests in their basins are much richer than the thorn forests of the northwestern part of Madhya Pradesh.

After the formation of [[Chhattisgarh]] State, the major portion of [[Mahanadi]] basin now lies in Chhattisgarh. Presently, only 154&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> basin area of Hasdeo River in Anuppur District lies in Madhya Pradesh.

The [[Satpura]]s, in the [[Gawilgarh]] and [[Mahadeo Hills]], also contain a watershed, which is south facing. The [[Wainganga River|Wainganga]], the [[Wardha River|Wardha]], the Pench, the [[Kanhan River|Kanhan]] rivers, discharge an enormous volume of water into the [[Godavari River|Godavari river]] system. The Godavari basin consists of [[sub-tropical]], semi-moist forests, mainly in the valley of the Indrawati. There are many important multi-state irrigation projects in development, including the [[Godavari River Basin Irrigation Projects]].

The official language of the state is [[Hindi]], which is spoken by over two-thirds of the population and is used for all government business.<ref name="langoff" /> In urban areas Standard Hindi is the main language, while [[Urdu]] is spoken by Muslims. In rural areas, however, most speak varieties counted as dialects of Hindi in the census, although most are quite distinct. In the west are [[Malvi language|Malvi]] and [[Nimadi language|Nimadi]] in the [[Malwa]] and [[Nimar]] regions, which are more closely related to the [[Rajasthani languages]]. In [[Bundelkhand]] in the north and [[Bagelkhand|Baghelkhand]] in the east are spoken [[Bundeli language|Bundeli]] and [[Bagheli language|Bagheli]] which are eastern varieties of the Hindi languages, similar to [[Awadhi language|Awadhi]] or [[Chhattisgarhi language|Chhattisgarhi]]. In the southeast is spoken Chhattisgarhi and [[Powari language|Powari]] is the language of the far south, both Eastern Hindi languages. Most speakers of these languages consider them to be dialects of Hindi and so report their language as 'Hindi' on the census.<ref name="census2011-langreport"/>

[[Marathi language|Marathi]] is another significant language. Due to [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] rule over much of what is now Madhya Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh is home to the largest number of Marathis outside Maharashtra. Although large numbers of Marathis can be found in urban centres like Indore, the highest concentrations are in the southern areas of the state adjoining Maharashtra. Marathi is the most-spoken language in Burhanpur district, while it is a major minority language in the southern parts of Mahakoshal especially Betul, Chhindwara and Balaghat districts.<ref name="census2011-langreport"/>

There are several languages spoken by the Adivasis. The various [[Bhil languages]] are Indo-Aryan languages spoken by 50 lakh Bhils of western Madhya Pradesh. Although many, especially in the eastern parts of their range, have adopted the regional languages as mother tongue, the languages are still strong in the far-western hills especially Barwani, Jhabua and Alirajpur districts where they are in the majority. [[Bhili language|Bhili]], the [[Pauri Bareli language|Bareli languages]] and [[Bhilali language|Bhilali]] are the major varieties spoken in the state.

[[Gondi language|Gondi]] is the second-largest Adivasi language, spoken by 11 lakh Gonds in the state. A [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian language]] related to [[Telugu language|Telugu]], it is mainly spoken in the southern Satpura highlands of Mahakoshal, where it is spoken with the regional languages. Some in the more remote valleys of the Satpuras speak a poorly-described Dravidian dialect called [[Bharia language|Bharia]]. Smaller minorities of Gondi speakers can be found in Khandwa and Dewas districts in the west as well as Anuppur, Sidhi and Singrauli districts in the east. Elsewhere in the state, the Gonds have almost totally abandoned their original language.

[[Korku language|Korku]], a [[Munda languages|Munda language]], has over 400,000 speakers in the central highlands of the state. In the far-southeast of Burhanpur can be found some speakers of the language isolate [[Nihali language|Nihali]] who live among the Korku. All speakers of tribal languages face significant pressure to switch to the dominant regional languages while their own tongues are considered 'backward' and 'rural'.<ref name="census2011-langreport" />

The following languages are taught in schools in Madhya Pradesh under the Three Language Formula:<ref>{{cite web |title=51st Report of the Commissioner for Linguistic Minorities in India |url=http://nclm.nic.in/shared/linkimages/NCLM51stReport.pdf |website=nclm.nic.in |publisher=[[Ministry of Minority Affairs]] |date=15 July 2015 |access-date=15 February 2018 |page=64 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180216025959/http://nclm.nic.in/shared/linkimages/NCLM51stReport.pdf |archive-date=16 February 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The constitutional head of the state is the [[List of Governors of Madhya Pradesh|Governor]], appointed by the [[President of India]]. The executive powers lie with the [[Chief Minister (India)|Chief Minister]], who is the elected leader of the state legislature. The current governor is Mangubhai C. Patel, and the current chief minister is [[Mohan Yadav]] of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP).

The political scenario of Madhya pradesh can be defines as below:

Post-Independence (1950s–1970s): The Indian National Congress (INC) held power for a significant period, with leaders like Ravishankar Shukla and Kailash Nath Katju as Chief Ministers. However, parties like Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS) – the precursor to BJP – started gaining ground in the 1960s.

Shifting Tides (1980s–1990s): This era saw a rise in regional parties and national alternatives. Janata Party (JP), Janata Dal (JD), and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) challenged the INC's dominance for a while.

Bi-polar Politics (2000s–present): Since the early 2000s, a two-party system has emerged. BJP and INC have become the main contenders, with occasional forays by smaller parties.

The dominant political parties in the state are the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) and the [[Indian National Congress]] (INC).
