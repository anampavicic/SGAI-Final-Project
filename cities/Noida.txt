Noida has roads laid mostly in a grid pattern, and all main roads are 6 lanes wide. Noida features three main expressways. One is the [[DND Flyway]], which connects Noida and Delhi, and runs across the river Yamuna. The second is the [[Noida–Greater Noida Expressway]], which connects Noida to Greater Noida. The third is the [[Yamuna Expressway]] which connects Greater Noida to [[Agra]] via [[Mathura]]. The [[Eastern Peripheral Expressway]], [[Delhi–Meerut Expressway]], [[Upper Ganges Canal Expressway]] and the [[Ganga Expressway]] are the four expressways that are currently under construction which will be passing through the city. The area adjacent to the NGN Expressway has seen heavy residential development in recent years.

A 4/6-lane double-decker elevated road is over the MP-II which takes only 5 minutes to cross the whole city. This {{cvt|4.8|km|adj=on}} road starts from Flex crossing and ends at Vishwa Bharti school. Another elevated road from sector 12/22 to sector 12/10-21/21A crossing is going to be built on the MP-I road. Three more elevated roads are planned. Along with these five elevated roads, several underpasses are under construction or approval and all these projects could be completed by 2020. Noida will become the city with the highest number of elevated roads and underpasses in India.

[[UPSRTC]], [[Delhi Transport Corporation|DTC]] and private buses ply through some routes in the city. Taxi, auto-rickshaws, and cycle rickshaws are available for short-distance transport.

The [[Noida–Greater Noida Expressway|Noida-Greater Noida Expressway]] is poised to become a self-sustaining urban pocket in Noida with good infrastructure. This {{cvt|24.5|km|mi|adj=mid|long}} corridor has attracted real estate Noida Extension investors and buyers with its good infrastructure facilities and connectivity to the other regions of NCR.

This area has emerged as a major growth corridor. Sectors abutting this corridor are 44, 45, 92–94, 96–100, 105, 108, 125–137 and 141–168. These sectors lie towards the south and south-east of Noida.

== Villages in Noida City ==
{{See also|List of cities in Uttar Pradesh|Nangli Wazidpur|Nithari}}

Noida originally consisted of around 81 villages, but now comes under the [[Gautam Budh Nagar district|Gautam Buddh Nagar district]] of Uttar Pradesh.<ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com">{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/Rural-Noida-to-enter-digital-domain/articleshow/47007097.cms|title=Rural Noida to enter digital domain|last=Keelor|first=Vandana|date=22 April 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]|access-date=3 October 2017}}</ref>

Still, Noida villages lack permanent postal and individual address but according to officials, the homes in villages will be soon mapped using aerial imagery captured by drones designed by North East Centre For Technology Application and Reach (NECTAR), an autonomous society set up under the Union government's department of science and technology. These maps will also provide crucial information about rural areas in an emergency. Officials said it will take almost a year to complete mapping and allotting addresses to all 81 villages.

With houses getting mapped and being allotted a formal address in Noida villages, procuring information on land rights, development plans, etc. will become easier. "Easily available maps will also be helpful in advancing development plans and settling disputes over bordering parcels of land. Mapping will also ease land transfers, by creating reliable maps and title documents."<ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"/>
