'''Chlef''' ({{langx|ar| الشلف}}) is the [[capital city|capital]] of [[Chlef Province]], [[Algeria]]. Located in the north of Algeria, {{convert|200|km|mi}} west of the capital, [[Algiers]], it was founded in 1843, as Orléansville, on the ruins of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ''Castellum Tingitanum''. In 1962, it was renamed al-Asnam, but after the [[1980 El Asnam earthquake|devastating earthquake on October 10, 1980]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.algerie360.com/seisme-10-octobre-1980-chlef-sen-souvient-encore/ |title=Séisme 10 octobre 1980 : Chlef s'en souvient encore  |publisher=Algérie 360° |language=fr |date=10 October 2018 |author=Hichem }}</ref> it has borne its present name, Chlef, which is derived from the name of the [[Chelif River]], the longest river in Algeria.

It is home to the soccer club [[ASO Chlef]], the [[Hassiba Ben Bouali]] university, and the ruins of the [[basilica]] of Reparatus, who was bishop of Castellum Tingitanum from 465 to 475. A corner of the flooring of the basilica contained a mosaic [[labyrinth]], the oldest known example of Christian use of this motif.

== History ==

=== Ancient Castellum Tingitii ===
The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] citadel, Castellum Tingitanum, was a city of the Roman province of [[Mauretania Caesariensis]].
The site became known as Al-Asnam (Arabic for "sculptures") during the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] period. It covered an area of {{convert|600|x|300|m|ft|abbr=off}} and contained many statues.

=== Former bishopric ===
A Christian [[basilica]] dating back to the reign of the [[Emperor Constantine]] was discovered here, with an elaborate mosaic. This is the oldest church to be found in Africa.<ref>Francois Decret, Early Christianity in North Africa (James Clarke & Co, 2011) p84</ref>
The Bishop Felix (Italian: Felice), was among the Catholic prelates summoned to the [[Council of Carthage (484)]] by the [[Vandal Kingdom|Arian Vandal]] king [[Huneric]] before he was [[exile]]d.
No other details are known about the ancient bishopric.

It was revived nominally as a Roman Catholic [[titular see]] in 1965, and was filled regularly since.

==== Titular bishops ====
* Agustín Rodríguez (1965.12.07 – 1968.12.25)
* Antonino Nepomuceno, Oblate [[O.M.I.]] (1969.07.11 – 1997.02.14)
* Ireneusz Józef Pękalski, [[Auxiliary Bishop]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Łódź]] (Poland) (1999.12.11 – present)

=== Al-Asnam and the Ouled Kosseir ===

Chellif Valley was from the 15th century the territory of the [[Bedouin]] Ouled Kosseir, who settled there under the leadership of Hamou El Kosseir (H'ammü'l-Quççayri) having displaced the indigenous Berber tribes. This tribe is a tribal Djouadi (military nobility). If they even call themselves descendants of the Beni Makhzum (Either Khaled Ibn El Walid).{{Clarify|date=February 2013}} Some historians believe that it belongs to the Confederation of Ibn Suwayd Zoghba of Beni Hillal and therefore cousins of Mehal, other military nobility.

Documents of the [[France|French]] army and other historians speak of "most powerful and wealthy tribes' in the Chellif Valley in 1830,{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} with more than 500,000 hectares of very fertile land and more than 19,000 soldiers. The Ouled Kosseir participated in the moubayâa{{Clarify|reason=what does this mean?|date=February 2013}} of the [[Abdelkader El Djezairi|Emir Abdelkader]], and their territory was granted under the [[Treaty of Tafna]].

After the defeat of the Emir and his allies, their lands were in large part confiscated and distributed among settlers and other [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] people, including Medjadja, [[marabouts]] who supported the French army on arrival.

The French Administration of Napoleon III, under the "Arab kingdom", tried to honour the leaders of the Ouled Kosseir with Djouadi{{clarify|reason=what does this mean?|date=February 2013}}. As such, some were decorated with the Legion of Honour (or Med Foudad Kharoubi Ben Ben Bia{{clarify|reason=what does this mean?|date=February 2013}}).

The last [[Kaid]] (tribal leader) after the arrival of the French army was Foudad Ben Adda, who served during 1867 on the city council of the municipality of Orleansville. He was also a member of the General Council of Algiers until his death in 1869.

=== Orléansville ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
In 1843 [[Thomas Robert Bugeaud|Maréchal Bugeaud]] founded the city of Orléansville at the modern site of Chlef.

The town was located at the confluence of the Chlef River and the Tsighaout River. The town developed due to the harsh climate, one of the hottest in northern Algeria.

The 6.7 {{M|w}} [[1954 Chlef earthquake|Chlef earthquake]] shook northern [[Algeria]] on 9 September 1954 with a maximum [[Mercalli intensity scale|Mercalli intensity]] of XI (''Extreme''). At least 1,243 people were killed and 5,000 were injured.
[[File:Chlef centre.jpg|thumb]]
At that time the town had a population of 44,400 inhabitants.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} It was the home of the '''Algerian Division''' of the artistic group [[Lettrist International]] ('''LI'''), some of whom died in the earthquake. Mohamed Dahou survived and went on to become involved in the [[Situationist International]]. The '''LI''' described the town as "the most [[lettrism|lettrist]] city in the world".{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

== Population ==
In the 2018 census the province of Chlef had just over 1 million inhabitants, of which 178,616 were living in the provincial capital Chlef. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/algeria/admin/02__chlef/|access-date=31 August 2022 |title=Chlef (Province, Algeria) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map and Location }}</ref>
==Geography==
Chlef lies in a valley at an elevation of {{convert|114|m|ft}} between two ranges of hills to the north and west. The city is surrounded by farmland; there are scattered trees both in the valley and on the hills.
===Climate===
Chlef has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csa''), with very hot, dry summers and mild, moist winters.
