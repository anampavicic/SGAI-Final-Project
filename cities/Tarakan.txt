'''Tarakan''' is an island and co-extensively the sole city within the [[Indonesia]]n [[Provinces of Indonesia|province]] of [[North Kalimantan]]. The island city is the largest urban area in [[North Kalimantan]] population-wise and is located in northern [[Borneo]], midway along the [[Celebes Sea|coast]] of the province. The city boundaries are co-extensive with the island (including a couple of small islands off the coast of the Tarakan Barat District). Once a major oil-producing region during the [[Dutch East Indies|colonial period]], Tarakan had great strategic importance during the [[Pacific War]] and was among the first [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] targets early in the conflict. It is the sole city within the newly established (in 2012) Indonesian province of [[North Kalimantan]]. According to [[Statistics Indonesia]], the city had a population of 193,370 at the 2010 Census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 242,786 inhabitants at the 2020 Census;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 249,960 (comprising 129,365 males and 120,595 females).<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Tarakan Utara Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.6571)</ref>

== Geography ==
The city is located on Tarakan island (off the east coast of Kalimantan), which composed of {{convert|25,080|ha}} of land.<ref name=":0" /> 27.5% of the city is composed of [[podzol]] soil and 57.63% [[latosol]] soil.<ref name=":0" /> The city is located between {{convert|0|-|110|m|}} above sea level.<ref name=":0" />

==History==

=== Etymology ===
According to legends, native [[Tidung people|Tidung]]s established their kingdom in Tarakan around 1076 CE. After moving their capital several times over the centuries, in 1571 CE they settled their kingdom on the eastern coast of Tarakan, apparently already [[The spread of Islam in Indonesia|under the influence of Islam]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Prasetyo|first=Deni|title=Mengenal Kerajaan-Kerajaan Nusantara|publisher=Pustaka Widyatama (Yogyakarta)|year=2009|isbn=9789796103096|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cGaEClsMFLQC&q=tarakan&pg=PA37}}</ref> The name Tarakan comes from the Tidung language:{{which?|date=November 2021}} {{lang|und|tarak}} (meeting place) and {{lang|und|ngakan}} (to eat); thus Tarakan was originally a meeting place for sailors and traders to eat, rest and trade their catch in the Tidung area.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hari Jadi & Sejarah |url=http://www.tarakankota.go.id/in/Sekilas_Tarakan.php?op=detil&mkode=harijadisejarah |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414001321/http://www.tarakankota.go.id/in/Sekilas_Tarakan.php?op=detil&mkode=harijadisejarah |archive-date=2010-04-14 |access-date=2021-05-19 |website=larakankota.go.id}}</ref>

[[Netherlands|Dutch]] explorers noted [[petroleum|oil seepages]] in 1863. In 1905, an oil concession was granted to Koninklijke Nederlandsche Petroleum Maatschappij' a predecessor to [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. One year later oil production began with a yield of over 57,928 barrels of oil per year. Production continued to increase and in the 1920s Tarakan yielded over five million barrels a year, a third of the total oil production in the whole of the [[Dutch East Indies]].<ref>{{Cite book

Japan had captured the [[Miri, Malaysia|Miri]] oil-field in Sarawak in December 1941, and captured oil-fields and refineries at [[Balikpapan]] in Dutch Borneo in January 1942, [[Sumatra]] in February, and [[Java]] in March. Oil technicians accompanied the invading Japanese troops to maintain production at captured facilities.  A team of one thousand additional [[petroleum engineering|petroleum engineers]] and technicians sailed from Japan aboard the ''[[Taiyo Maru]]'', but nearly 800 drowned when [[USS Grenadier (SS-210)|USS ''Grenadier'']] sunk the ''Taiyo Maru'' southwest of [[Kyushu]] on 8&nbsp;May 1942.<ref>Dunnigan, James F. & [[Albert Nofi|Nofi, Albert A.]] ''Victory at Sea'' (1995) William Morrow & Company {{ISBN|0-688-14947-2}} pp.360–361</ref>  Despite this loss, Tarakan crude oil (mixed with lesser quantities of [[Manchuria]]n [[oil-shale]] distillates) became the primary [[feedstock]] for Japanese [[diesel fuel]] in 1942, while reserve supplies of California crude oil remained the primary feedstock for Japanese [[gasoline]] and [[residual fuel]]s until 1943.<ref name="grimes"/>

Tarakan became a Japanese strategic air-base from which further attacks could be launched following the Dutch surrender. Tarakan's inhabitants suffered under Japan's occupation. The large number of Japanese troops stationed on the island led to food-shortages and many civilians suffered from [[malnutrition]]. During the occupation, the Japanese transported some 600 labourers to Tarakan from [[Java]]. The Japanese also forced an estimated 300 Javanese women to work as "[[comfort women]]".

Tarakan oil-field production reached 350,000 barrels per month by early 1944, but Japan no longer had enough [[oil tankers]] to transport this volume to Japanese refineries. Without adequate supplies of refined residual fuel-oil for the forthcoming [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], Japanese aircraft-carriers refueled with unrefined Tarakan crude-oil in June 1944. The un[[desalter|desalted]] crude-oil damaged [[boiler]] tubes, and the unremoved [[naphtha]] fraction volatilized to form [[flammability limit|explosive atmospheres]], contributing to the loss of the aircraft carriers [[Japanese aircraft carrier Taihō|''Taihō'']], [[Japanese aircraft carrier Shōkaku|''Shōkaku'']], and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiyō|''Hiyō'']].<ref name="wolborsky"/>

The last Japanese tanker left Tarakan in July 1944; [[Allies of World War II | Allied]] bombing-raids damaged the oil-field facilities later that year; and the veteran [[26th Brigade (Australia)|Australian 26th Brigade Group]] ended the Japanese occupation of the area with the [[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|second Battle of Tarakan]] (1&nbsp;May to 21&nbsp;June 1945).<ref>Cressman, Robert J.

===Independence Era===
Following the [[Indonesian revolution]] in the late 1940s, Tarakan became part of the new republic. It was administered as a district following a Presidential Decree Number 22, 1963.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Profil Kota Tarakan|url=http://ciptakarya.pu.go.id/profil/profil/timur/kaltim/tarakan.pdf}}</ref> In 1981, Tarakan was granted a city charter, at that time one of four cities in [[East Kalimantan]], along with [[Samarinda]], [[Balikpapan]] and [[Bontang]] in accordance with Government Law Number 47, 1981.

The city witnessed the [[Tarakan riot]] in 2010 following a clash between [[Buginese people|Buginese migrants]] from neighboring Sulawesi island and the [[Tidung people]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ini Kronologi Lengkap Kerusuhan Tarakan versi Polri|url=https://www.tribunnews.com/nasional/2010/09/30/ini-kronologi-lengkap-kerusuhan-tarakan-versi-polri|access-date=2021-04-13|website=Tribunnews.com|language=id-ID}}</ref> The two groups later agreed to a peace deal, mediated by local police and the governor of then-[[East Kalimantan]], [[Awang Faroek Ishak]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2010-09-29|title=Kesepakatan damai di Tarakan|url=https://www.bbc.com/indonesia/berita_indonesia/2010/09/100929_tarakanpeaceaccord|access-date=2021-04-13|website=BBC News Indonesia|language=id}}</ref> After [[North Kalimantan]] was established as a province in 2012, Tarakan became the sole city within the new province.<ref name=":0" /> In 2015, the city witnessed another riot, this time related to the [[2015 North Kalimantan gubernatorial election]] between the candidates' supporters.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hantoro|first=Juli|date=2015-12-19|title=Rusuh Pascapilkada, Kantor Gubernur Kalimantan Utara Dibakar|url=https://nasional.tempo.co/read/729194/rusuh-pascapilkada-kantor-gubernur-kalimantan-utara-dibakar|access-date=2021-04-13|website=Tempo|language=en}}</ref>

== Demographics ==
Tarakan had a population of 193,370 at the 2010 Census,<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> but the 2020 Census this had grown to 242,786,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> and the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 249,960.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Tarakan Utara Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.6571)</ref> Indigenous residents include the [[Tidung people|Tidung]], a subgroup of the [[Dayak people]]. In addition, the city also has a multi-ethnic population from other parts of Indonesia, such as [[Bugis]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and [[Chinese Indonesians]]. 85% of the city's population is Muslim, around 10% are Christian, 1.3% Hindu, 0.04% Buddhist, and 0.03% Confucianist.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Badan Pusat Statistik|url=https://tarakankota.bps.go.id/publication/2021/02/26/07279a2c598f6e49d7e94397/kota-tarakan-dalam-angka-2021.html|access-date=2021-04-20|website=tarakankota.bps.go.id}}</ref>

Population growth averaged 2.23% per year in the decade 2010-2020. The city population has increased rapidly which is thought to be caused by high urbanization rate with people moving in from neighbouring regions. The sex ratio as of 2020 was 100:109—100 females for every 109 males. The city is dominated by a young and reproductive age population above the age of 15, which accounts around 64.53% of city's population. Life expectancy in the city as of 2020 was 74 years, which is considerably higher than both the provincial and national average; it has been increasing consistently.<ref name=":1" />
