'''Kırıkkale''' is a city in the [[Central Anatolia Region, Turkey|Central Anatolia]] region of [[Turkey]]. It is the seat of [[Kırıkkale Province]] and [[Kırıkkale District]].<ref name=il>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx İl Belediyesi], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory. Retrieved 1 March 2023.</ref> Its population is 186,960 (2022).<ref name=tuik>{{Cite web |title=Address-based population registration system (ADNKS) results dated 31 December 2022, Favorite Reports|url=https://biruni.tuik.gov.tr/medas/?kn=95&locale=en |access-date=13 March 2023|publisher=[[TÜİK]]|language=en|format=XLS}}</ref> It is located 80&nbsp;km east of [[Ankara]] which is the capital city of [[Turkey]]. The name of the city means ''broken castle''.

The town of Kırıkkale is located on the Ankara-[[Kayseri]] railway near the [[Kızılırmak River]] in central Turkey. Formerly a village, it owes its rapid rise in population mainly to the establishment of steel mills in the 1950s. These works, among the largest in the country, specialize in high-quality alloy steel and machinery. In the 1960s, chemical plants were added and in 1986, the [[Tüpraş Kırıkkale Oil Refinery]] was established.

Kırıkkale in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] means "broken castle". Inhabitation began in the 16th century when Turkish tribes came from the east and settled in [[Central Anatolia]].
