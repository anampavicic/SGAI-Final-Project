When the Spanish explorer [[Hernán Cortés]] arrived in what is now Mexican territory on 22 April 1519, he founded a city, which he named ''Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz'', referring to the area's gold and dedicated to the "[[True Cross]]", because he landed on the Christian holy day of [[Good Friday]], the day of the [[Crucifixion]].

==Etymology==
The name ''Veracruz'' (originally ''Vera Cruz''), derives from the [[Latin]] ''Vera Crux'' ([[True Cross]]). Having established the settlement of ''Villa Rica'' (Rich Village) on [[Good Friday]], 22 April 1519, Cortés dedicated the place to the True Cross as an [[Sacrifice|offering]].

While Veracruz itself was founded by [[Hernán Cortés]] who arrived in 1519, the area at the time was within the jurisdiction of [[Moctezuma II]] and his [[Aztec Empire]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Williamson |first=Edwin |url= |title=The Penguin history of Latin America |date= |publisher=Allen Lane |others= |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-7139-9076-8 |location=London |pages=17 |language=en}}</ref> Cortés and his men landed at the shore opposite the island where Grijalva had moored, which has the pre-Hispanic name of Chalchihuecan.<ref name="encmuc"/> Cortés, [[Francisco de Montejo]] and [[Alonso Hernández Puertocarrero]] founded the settlement, naming it Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz.<ref name=Diaz>Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140441239}}</ref>{{rp|102}} The name ''Villa Rica'' (rich village) referred to the gold that was found here and ''Vera Cruz'' (True Cross) was added because the Cortés expedition landed on [[Good Friday]], a Christian holy day.<ref name="encmuc"/> When Cortés and his soldiers abolished the Aztec despotism and elected a ''Justicia Mayor'' and a ''Capitán General'', they created the first city council on the American continent.<ref name="sinopsis"/> The city was the first on mainland America to receive a European coat of arms, which was authorized by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Carlos V]] in [[Valladolid]], Spain, on 4 July 1523.<ref name="encmuc"/>
[[File:Nebel Voyage 01 Veracruz (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The Zócalo of Veracruz in 1836.]]
The original settlement was moved in 1525 to what is now known as Antigua, at the mouth of the [[Antigua River|Huitzilapan]] (or Antigua River) shortly thereafter.<ref name="encmuc"/> This separated the city from the port, as ships could not enter the shallow river. Ships continued to dock at San Juan de Ulúa, with small boats being used to ferry goods on and off the ships.

As in other parts of Mexico, the [[indigenous peoples]] suffered from epidemics of European infectious diseases, which decimated the population after contact. The [[Portuguese Empire]] began to import African slaves via the port of Veracruz. In the 16th century, the state had more slaves than any other in Mexico.<ref name="histchan"/> Before the slave trade was abolished, Mexico had the second-highest population of African slaves in the Americas, following Brazil.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Veracruz was the most important port in [[New Spain]], with a large wealthy merchant class that was more prosperous than that of Mexico City.<ref name="ayuntamiento" /> Each of the two yearly voyages of the [[Spanish treasure fleet]] to and from Spain were to gather at Veracruz stevedores, muleteers, navigators, sailors, contractors, merchants and civil servants. In 1568 the Armada admiral Francisco Luján defeated the British pirates [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] and [[Francis Drake]] on their attempt [[Battle of San Juan de Ulúa (1568)|to take hold]] of Veracruz. By the end of the 16th century, the Spanish had constructed roads to link Veracruz with other cities such as [[Córdoba, Veracruz|Córdoba]], [[Orizaba, Veracruz|Orizaba]], [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], [[Xalapa]] and [[Perote, Veracruz|Perote]]. Their gold and silver were the principal exports.<ref name="histchan"/><ref name="sinopsis"/> 

This caused the city problems with pirates, prompting the construction of Fort San Juan de Ulúa on the island where Grijalva had landed in the mid-16th century.<ref name="encmuc" />  In 1600, when large-scale smuggling of goods took place to avoid customs officials,<ref name="sinopsis" /> the Spanish Crown ordered the settlement returned to its original site to cut down on that traffic.<ref name="encmuc" /> Docks and an observation tower were constructed on the island to ensure that goods went through customs officials.<ref name="sinopsis" /> Major public buildings were constructed at the beginning of the 17th century: the municipal palace, the monastery of ''Nuestra Señora de la Merced'', and the ''Hospital de Nuestra Señora de Loreto''. In 1618, a fire nearly reduced much of the city to ashes. In 1640, the Barlovento Armada was stationed here for additional defense against pirates.<ref name="encmuc" />  The pirates, led by Spain's rival nations, [[Nicholas van Hoorn]], [[Laurens de Graaf]] and [[Michel de Grammont]] [[Attack on Veracruz|attacked Vera Cruz in 1683]].

During the 18th century Veracruz's defence was improved with the construction of a wall around it (1790), bastions [[Baluarte de Santiago]] and gates, and San Juan de Ulua's renovation to today's appearance. The reason was to protect this valuable port after the threat of an invasion such as the [[siege of Havana]] (1762) by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]]. The Spanish empire's talented military engineers were gathered in Veracruz to work on the New Spanish [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf of Mexico's]] defence against the attack of Spain's enemies in a time when the Spanish Empire stretched from current [[Guayana Province|Venezuela]] to [[Spanish Florida|Florida]]. Many of the buildings and institutions which form Veracruz's Historic Centre date from that time such as the [[Cathedral of Veracruz|cathedral]] (1731), the Military Hospital of San Carlos (1731) or modern water supply and sewerage systems. 

In 1804 the [[Balmis Expedition]] arrived at Veracruz with the smallpox vaccine, which was from here transported to the whole of New Spain. The 19th century was marked by armed conflicts. During the [[Mexican War of Independence]], Spain placed troops here to maintain Mexico City's sea link with Spain. In 1816, [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] commanded royalist troops countering the insurgency. In 1820, insurgents took the city, despite Santa Anna's attempts to stop them. The last viceroy of New Spain, [[Juan O'Donojú]], arrived here in 1821, where he signed the [[Treaty of Córdoba]] with [[Agustín de Iturbide]] at Fort San Juan de Ulúa. In 1823, Spanish troops remaining at Fort San Juan de Ulúa fired on the newly independent Mexican city of Veracruz. In 1825 the last Spanish troops left San Juan de Ulúa.

The city's defense against the attack earned its first title of "Heroic City". During the [[Pastry War]] in 1837, the city mounted a defense against a French attack, and earned its second title of "Heroic City."<ref name="encmuc"/>

[[File:Scene in Vera Cruz during the bombardment, March 25, 1847 LCCN95509314 (cropped).jpg|thumb|The [[Siege of Veracruz|1847 Siege of Veracruz]] during the [[Mexican-American War]].]]
In 1847 during the [[Mexican–American War]], United States forces invaded the city. It was defended by generals Juan Morales and José Juan de Landero. The siege continued with brisk firing until 27 March, by which time a considerable breach had been made in the wall surrounding the city. Upon this General Morales, who was Governor of both the city and of San Juan de Ulúa, commenced a correspondence with [[Winfield Scott|General Winfield Scott]] looking to the surrender of the town, forts and garrison. On the 29th Vera Cruz and San Juan de Ulúa were occupied by Scott's army. About five thousand prisoners and four hundred pieces of artillery, in addition to large amounts of small arms and ammunition, fell into the hands of the victorious invaders. The casualties on the US side during the siege amounted to sixty-four officers and men, killed and wounded.

Ten years later, civil war between liberals and conservatives forced [[Benito Juárez]]'s government to flee Mexico City. Juárez went to Veracruz and governed from there in 1857.<ref name="histchan"/> In 1861 Spain sent its troops to occupy the port in an effort to secure payment of debts, which Juárez had suspended. French military forces accompanied them to prepare for [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximiliano I]] and occupied the city when the emperor and his wife [[Carlota of Belgium]] arrived in 1864.<ref name="encmuc"/>

The conflicts and damaged trade relations with Europe took its toll on the port of Veracruz. By 1902, the port facilities had deteriorated, and it was considered one of the most dangerous on the American coast. President [[Porfirio Díaz]] contracted with foreign enterprises to modernize the port's infrastructure.<ref name="sinopsis"/>

After the Revolution, most port workers became unionized. Through most of the 20th century, federal and state legal and political initiatives intended to better workers' lives had effects on the operations of the port. Eventually, unions came to have great power over the operations and tariffs charged. By the latter part of the 20th century, competing unions made the operations of the port difficult. Some blocked access to the port from federal roads and financial corruption was a problem.

In the 1970s, a federal commission was established to design a new administrative system for the ports of Mexico. The legislature passed laws authorizing the federal government to take control over important ports such as Veracruz. The federal government modernized the port, adopting automation of loading and unloading. This resulted in a reduction of 80% of the port's jobs and labor resistance through strikes. The dockworkers' unions unified, negotiating for members to have a stake in a new company to manage the port's functions, named the ''Empresa de Servicios Portuarios de Veracruz, S.A. de C.V''. The old ''Compañia Terminal de Veracruz'' was dissolved in 1988 and the new organization was fully in place by 1991.<ref name="sinopsis"/>

The area is flat with little in the way of elevations and is crossed by the Medio, Grande and Tonayán Rivers. There are also beaches here such as the Sacrificios and Verde. Its climate is tropical with an average temperature of {{convert|25.3|°C|1}}. Vegetation is mostly of the rainforest type, with many trees losing leaves during the winter dry season. Fauna mostly consists of birds, small mammals and insects.<ref name="encmuc"/>

Much of the land in the municipality outside of the city is used for agriculture and livestock. Principal crops include corn, beans, watermelon, oranges, [[sorghum]], [[mango]], pineapple and sugar cane. Livestock raised includes cattle, pigs, sheep, fowl and horses. There is also some forestry. The municipality contains deposits of marble, lime, cement, sand and clay. In and around the city there are a number of industrial sites producing paints and solvents, food products, plastics, petrochemicals and metals.<ref name="encmuc"/>

Veracruz has many beaches and off coast islands. Controversy has accompanied the clean-up of the island called [[Isla de Sacrificios]], which lies just off the coast of the city and measures 450 meters long and 198 meters wide. The island is part of a system of twenty-three coral reefs called the [[Veracruz Reef System]], which is protected as a national park.<ref name="jornada">{{Cite news |title= La isla in disputa |first=Gabriela |last=Cortanos Delgado |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/10/31/eco-d.html |newspaper= La Jornada Ecológica |publisher=UNAM |location=Mexico City |date=31 October 2005 |access-date=30 October 2009 |language=es |trans-title= The island in dispute }}</ref> Visitors can kayak to the Isla de Sacrificios to observe seagulls, pelicans and the fish that inhabit the coral reef.<ref name="portal">{{Cite web|url=http://portal.veracruz.gob.mx/portal/page?_pageid=153,4198113&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |title=Portal de Ciudadano Veracruz |language=es |trans-title=Veracruz Citizen Portal |access-date=29 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405072945/http://portal.veracruz.gob.mx/portal/page?_pageid=153%2C4198113&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |archive-date=5 April 2009 }}</ref> In 1983, a study and initial cleanup project was undertaken at the island, which collected fifty tons of trash.

However, access to the island has been restricted to research, teaching and the occasional sporting event.<ref name="jornada"/>

Other small islands and shoals off the coast include: [[Isla de Enmedio]], [[Isla Verde, Mexico|Isla Verde]], [[Anegada de Adentro]], [[Santiaguillo]] and [[Anegada de Afuera]], the last two next to Antón Lizardo beach. All of them are included within the Sistema Arrecifal Veracruzano national park and make fine sites for SCUBA diving. Several operators in Veracruz and in Boca del Rio offer scuba equipment and tours. The best season for scuba diving is May to August.

The mainland has several beaches. Playa Martí is located between the city of Veracruz and Boca del Río. The Playa de Hornos is located next to the Veracruz Aquarium. There are also boats that take tourist to the Isla Canuncito. Villa del Mar is just south of Playa de Hornos.<ref name="portal"/>

==Culture==
[[File:Veleros en Veracruz.jpg|thumb|left|Ships at the 2022 Latin American Festival of Sailing.]]
Because of its importance as Mexico's principal Caribbean and Atlantic sea port, Veracruz has always been a locus for the mixture of different cultures, particularly [[Spaniards in Mexico|Spanish]], [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Native Mexican]], and [[African culture|African]]. During the colonial period, African slaves were imported to work in the fields and shipyards. Following Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821, immigrants from Italy and Cuba settled in the city.<ref name="alisau"/><ref name="bestday"/><ref name="Hursh"/>

The Veracruz Carnaval has been celebrated every year since 1866, during the empire of [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]]. At that time, a request was made to sponsor a "Festival of Masks", which would consist of dances at the principal social gathering sites of the city such as the main theater. While the events were officially held at these locations, many residents took advantage of the celebration on the streets near these sites. Eventually, the event became based in the historic center of the city and focused on the [[Carnival|Carnaval]] Parade of Veracruz. Today, the event begins with the "Burning of Bad Humor" and ends with the "Burial of Juan Carnaval".<ref name="vcarnaval">{{Cite web |url= http://www.carnavaldeveracruz.com.mx/ |title= Carnaval de Veracruz Tradición  |access-date=29 October 2009 }}</ref> Carnaval here is the largest celebration in the country.<ref name="bestday"/>
[[File:Carnaval Veracruz 2014.jpg|thumb|right|The [[:es:Carnaval de Veracruz|Carnaval of Veracruz]] parade.]]
Sugar and rum production have been mainstays as commodities; during colonial times they were produced by slave labor and later, immigrants often entered labor and industrial jobs. Together these ethnic groups have created rich cultures.<ref name="snapper"/><ref name="Hughson">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1320-veracruz-for-gringos |title= Veracruz For Gringos  |first=Dean and Yoly |last=Hughson Graber |publisher=MexConnect |access-date=29 October 2009 }}</ref> The Naval Academy attracts both Mexican and international sailors and officers, adding to the cosmopolitan mix of the city.<ref name="Hughson"/> The city has a reputation for being lively, with many people out in the squares listening to music late into the night.

===Music===
[[File:Platzkonzert in Veracruz.jpg|thumb|left|[[Son Jarocho]] players in a plaza in Veracruz's historic center.]] 
The song "[[La Bamba (song)|La Bamba]]", made famous by [[Ritchie Valens]], has its roots in the Veracruz [[son (music)|"son"]] style of music, which originated in southern part of the state of Veracruz. It has African and Caribbean influence and is popular throughout Mexico, Latin America and the United States. 

Traditional Veracruzian music is called "[[Son Jarocho]]". Although there are many types of son music found in Mexico, the Son Jarocho is typically associated with the city of Veracruz. Other types of son include "Son Comercial". This style is faster and flashier than the traditional Son Jarocho and can be heard in [[Ballet Folklorico de Mexico|Mexican folkdance exhibitions]], when Veracruz women with long white dresses and fans dance with partners also dressed in white. The Son Comercial developed in the 1940s from the Son Jarocho; in the 21st century it is so pervasive that many mistakenly believe it to be the first version. The Casa de Cultura has a workshops for traditional music and son singers can be heard just about anytime on the main plaza (Zócalo)<ref name="carraher">{{Cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1598-la-bamba-explained-or-the-music-of-veracruz  |title= La Bamba Explained - Or, The Music of Veracruz  |first=Janice |last=Carraher |publisher=MexConnect |access-date=29 October 2009 }}</ref>

===Cuisine===
[[File:GrandCafeParroquiaVeracruz.JPG|thumb|right|"El Gran Café de la Parroquia" is the most famous cafe in Veracruz.]]
Veracruz recipes use corn, beans and squash as staples, a practice dating to the indigenous peoples. Local diets also include indigenous tropical foods such as [[chili pepper]]s, tomatoes, [[avocado]]s, [[pineapple]]s, [[papaya]], [[mamey (disambiguation)|mamey]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[peanut]]s and [[sapote]] fruit, all of which have been cultivated since pre-Columbian times. The Spanish introduced the use of herbs such as [[parsley]], [[thyme]], [[marjoram]], [[bay laurel]] and [[coriander]], as well as [[saffron]], wheat, rice, almonds, olives/olive oil, garlic and [[capers]].<ref name="Hursh"/> Because of the lengthy colonial period and international port, these ingredients are used more widely here than in other parts of the country.<ref name="snapper"/>

A signature dish of the area, ''[[Huachinango a la Veracruzana]]'' ([[red snapper (fish)|red snapper]] Veracruz-style), uses local fruits and vegetables (tomatoes, chili peppers) and Spanish ingredients (olive oil, garlic and capers). Other popular dishes include {{lang|es|arroz a la tumbada}}, a rice dish baked with a variety of seafood and {{lang|es|caldo de mariscos}}, a seafood soup reputed to cure [[hangover]]s.<ref name="Hursh"/>

Coffeehouses are a center of social life in the city, and the ''Gran Café del Portal'' and the ''Café de la Parroquia'' are the two best-known establishments. To request a refill, customers clink the sides of their glasses (not cups) with their spoons. This clinking can be heard from the early morning to late at night. The story behind this custom is that a trolley driver used to ring his bell when he was a block away from the Gran Café del Portal to let the waiters know he was coming. When the driver died, his casket was borne on the trolley and when it passed the establishment, the customers and waiters tapped their glasses in his honor.<ref name="alisau"/>

Veracruz is not as popular a tourist destination as many other resort areas.<ref name="alisau"/> But the city has been promoting an identity as a tourist destination, emphasizing new attractions such as the [[Veracruz Aquarium]] and the City Museum, and the renovation of historic ones, such as Fort San Juan de Ulúa and the Naval Academy.<ref name="bestday"/>

The cultural center of the city is its main plaza, officially named Plaza de las Armas but commonly called the Zócalo. This tree-shaded square, in which a number of foreign invading armies have camped, is occupied from morning to night with people playing dominos, selling food, cigars, etc. playing music, dancing and other activities. It is more crowded in the evening, when nearly every night the [[danzón]] is danced. This dance was brought over to Mexico from Cuba by refugees in the 1870s. It was originally restricted to the lower classes but eventually gained accepted by all levels of society. The danzón is sponsored by several dance schools dedicated to keeping the tradition alive. Around the plaza are numerous shops and restaurants, as well as the municipal palace and the cathedral.<ref name="alisau"/><ref name="portalCH">{{Cite web|url=http://portal.veracruz.gob.mx/portal/page?_pageid=153,4202334&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |title=Centro Histórico de la Ciudad y Puerto de Veracruz |language=es |trans-title=Historic Center of the City and the Port of Veracruz |access-date=29 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411083347/http://portal.veracruz.gob.mx/portal/page?_pageid=153%2C4202334&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |archive-date=11 April 2009 }}</ref>

The Municipal Palace was built for the city council in 1608. The building was extensively remodeled in the 18th century. Its architectural style is a sober [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] with a tower at one of the corners. Lookouts used this tower to keep watch on the ships entering and leaving the port. It has a large courtyard surrounded by wide arches and is the oldest city government building in Mexico.<ref name="portalCH"/>

The [[Cathedral of Veracruz]], named ''Catedral de la Virgen de la Asunción'', is also located on the Zócalo. This cathedral was begun in the 17th century and finished in 1731. It was modified in the 19th century but was not designated as a cathedral until 1963. The building has five [[nave]]s, with an octagonal [[cupola]] covered in [[Talavera (pottery)|Puebla tiles]]. The tower was begun in the early 20th century and has its own small cupola. The main façade is [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassic]] with two levels and a crest. The lower level contains an arched entrance flanked by two [[Doric order|Doric columns]] and the upper level contains the choral window, above which is a medallion. The interior is simple with crystal candelabras.<ref name="catedral">{{Cite web |url=http://www.arqhys.com/contenidos/consagrada-catedral-veracruz.html |title= Consagrada Catedral de Veracruz |publisher=ARQHYS |language=es |trans-title=Consecrated Cathedral of Veracruz|access-date=30 October 2009  }}</ref>

In the port area are the [[Pemex]] Tower, the old lighthouse, which was the seat of government for [[Venustiano Carranza]], and the Crafts Market. On Marina Mercante Street are located the Old Customs Building, the Postal and Telegraph twin buildings, as well as the old railroad terminal.

The ''malecón'' (boardwalk) stretches for kilometers along the Gulf of Mexico, leading from the city center into the suburbs. This area is popular at night, when people stroll and exercise, enjoying the ocean breezes. Near the city center, the malecón is crowded with merchants selling knick-knacks, souvenirs, jewelry made with seashells, and T-shirts.<ref name="alisau"/>
[[File:Detalles de Clavijero.jpg|thumb|right|The historic Clavijero Theatre.]]
Fort San Juan de Ulúa is located on an island, now connected to land of the same name. The island is part of the La Gallega coral reef and has about 2,500 meters of beach. The full reef covers about 100 hectares and varies in depth between sixty and ninety centimeters, forming a natural break.<ref name="sinopsis"/> In the pre-Hispanic era, this island was a sanctuary dedicated to the god Tezcatlipoca.<ref name="portalCH"/> The site where the Spanish first landed has been developed over the centuries and today serves as the container ship terminal of the port.<ref name="sinopsis"/> Most of the island is occupied by the fort. This fort was built where the Spanish first landed to conquer Mexico City. They used it for their last defense during and just after the Mexican War of Independence.<ref name="portalCH"/> Between these periods, the fort helped defend the city against piracy and later was used for prisoners and interrogations of the [[Mexican Inquisition]].<ref name="alisau"/> The fort was begun here in 1582 to protect the city from pirates<ref name="portalCH"/> and was enlarged in 1635 during the period of frequent pirate raids. It was finished in 1707.<ref name="alisau"/>
[[File:2020-02-17 Municipal palace of Veracruz 03 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The Municipal Palace of Veracruz.]]
After the War of Independence ended in 1821, the Spanish kept control of the island and fort, and occasionally bombarded Mexican forces on land. They finally transferred this area to Mexico in 1825. The fort was used in 1838 during the Pastry War with the French. In 1847, it was used for an unsuccessful defense of the port when United States forces invaded during the Mexican–American War.<ref name="portalCH"/>

In the 19th century, the fort was converted into a military prison.<ref name="portalCH"/> The fort's narrow stone passageways lead to a series of dungeons with walls 24-feet thick in some places. Those cells which were darker and hotter were reserved for those charged with more serious crimes. A few of the most dreaded dungeons were nicknamed "Heaven", "Purgatory" and "Hell". Some of prison's more famous prisoners include Fray [[Servando Teresa de Mier]] and Benito Juárez, both political prisoners. But the most famous is Jesús Arriaga, better known as "[[Jesús Arriaga|Chucho el Roto]]".<ref name="alisau"/> Most people visit San Juan de Ulúa out of attraction to the legend of this 19th-century bandit.<ref name="todd">{{Cite web |url= http://www.johntoddjr.com/122%20Chucho/chucho01.htm |title= Chucho el Roto: The Legend of a Mexican Bandit The Folk Hero of San Juan de Ulua |first=John Jr. |last=Todd |publisher=Universidad Veracruzana |access-date=29 October 2009 }}</ref>

Jesús Arriaga, better known as ''Chucho el Roto'', was held at Fort San Juan de Ulúa where he died. It is not known whether he died of natural causes, as a result of a fight with other prisoners or by other means. Chucho was a [[Robin Hood]] figure who lived during the 19th century.<ref name="uvmx"/> He stole from the rich and gave to the poor, inspiring songs and poetry such as the verses penned by [[Rafael de Zayas Enríquez]]. Chucho was arrested in the city of [[Querétaro, Querétaro|Querétaro]] after a jewelry store heist. He was sent to the Belén Prison in Mexico City, then to Veracruz. He was also renowned as a seducer of women, especially those who were rich and lonely. Most of his targets were jewelry shops, pawnshops and the homes of the wealthy.<ref name="uvmx">{{Cite web|url=http://www.uv.mx/Popularte/esp/scriptphp.php?sid=495 |title=Chucho el Roto |first=Marko |last=Castillo |publisher=Universidad Veracruzana |access-date=29 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717082128/http://www.uv.mx/Popularte/esp/scriptphp.php?sid=495 |archive-date=17 July 2011 }}</ref>

Along with Fort San Juan de Ulúa, the city used to be walled in for protection against pirates and invasions. All that is left of these city walls is the ''Baluarte'', a small fortress. The 1635 structure has thick, sturdy walls with cannons directed to cover sea approaches. Inside is a small museum featuring a collection of high-quality pre-Hispanic jewelry discovered in the 1970s by a fisherman.<ref name="baluarte">{{Cite web |url=http://www.fodors.com/world/mexico-and-central-america/mexico/veracruz/review-443322.html |title= Baluarte de Santiago |publisher=Fodor's |access-date=30 October 2009 }}</ref>

The City Museum (Museo de la Ciudad) is located at the intersections of Zaragoza and Esteban Morales streets in the historic center. It is housed in a two-story building which is of [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassic]] design built between the mid and latter 19th century. The main façade on Zaragoza Street has an enormous main door with posts, framed by [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[pilaster]]s, which reach to the upper floor, and topped by a [[pediment]] and a [[cornice]]. The building was originally constructed as an asylum. When the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French invaded Veracruz]] in 1861, the building was commandeered for other purposes until 1870.

Lara was one of the city's most famous sons as a popular songwriter and singer in Mexico. He began his career playing the piano in brothels and later became a bullfighter. Lara had seven wives, one of whom was Mexican screen diva [[María Félix|María "La Doña" Félix]], for whom he wrote the song "María Bonita". To be a gentleman, when he and Félix were about to break up, he married her to "make an honest woman of her" even though they had lived together for years.<ref name="alisau"/>

==Economy==
[[File:Buque en el Puerto de Veracruz 02.jpg|thumb|right|The port of Veracruz is the largest and most important in Mexico.]]

[[Laguna Verde Nuclear Power Plant]] (LVNPP) in nearby Alto Lucero, Veracruz, produces about 4.5% of Mexico's electrical energy.

===Port of Veracruz===
The Port of Veracruz is the oldest and largest port in Mexico, deeply important to its history.<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="alisau"/><ref name="Rueda"/> During the colonial period, it was the most important port in New Spain, the connection to ports and the Atlantic trade creating a large wealthy merchant class, which was more prosperous than that of Mexico City.<ref name="ayuntamiento"/> From the port of Veracruz were exported turkeys, corn, beans, avocados, and cotton to Spain. From Spain came [[fava bean]]s, wheat, rice, cattle, pigs, fabric, wine and other goods. In the mid 16th century, so much gold and silver was found in Veracruz that these precious metals were the chief export to Spain on what were called treasure ships commonly known as [[Spanish treasure fleet]]. The bounty attracted pirates, mostly from Britain and Holland, such as [[Francis Drake]] and [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]], who preyed on such ships.<ref name="ayuntamiento"/> Veracruz was invaded during conflicts with France and the United States.<ref name="encmuc"/>
[[File:Veracruz 06 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Hotel in Veracruz's historic center.]] 
In the latter half of the 19th century, Veracruz's importance waned as trade to Europe diminished. The port was refurbished at the beginning of the 20th century, but petroleum production was the primary income for the state rather than the port.<ref name="sinopsis"/> This began to change in the latter half of the 20th century, and the port has surged back to the state's economic forefront.<ref name="bestday"/>

In 1991, the [[Government of Mexico|federal government]] took over the port of Veracruz to correct{{how|date=May 2016}} the handling of merchandise. Later that same year, the first private shipping companies began operations. In 1993, the Law of Ports was passed regularizing the operations of ports in the country. This law created the Administración Portuaria de Veracruz (Port Authority of Veracruz).<ref name="puerto">{{Cite web |url=https://gezily.com/ispanya-gezi-rehberi |title= spain travel guide |publisher=Gezily |location=Turkey |language=tr}}</ref>

In the 2000s, the port continues to handle all kinds of cargo, moving 16.1 million tons{{Verify source|date=June 2010}} of products in 2004. This figure is expected to rise once modernization efforts have finished, especially a truck bypass that leads directly from the highway to the port.<ref name="Rueda"/> Veracruz is the gateway for [[Automotive industry in Mexico|Mexico's automobile industry]], which is concentrated in the center of the country, in the states around Mexico City. This port has several advantages. It is the first to be equipped specifically for shipping automobiles. Located on the south-central coast, Veracruz is closer to car manufacturers and has better access to both import and export markets in the U.S., Europe, Central and South America than other Mexican ports. In 2004, the port handled 70% of the automobiles exported. With traffic expected to rise, the port authorities unveiled a program to enlarge the port's infrastructure and expand operations by 2010.<ref name="Rueda"/> However conversion of port area for tourism challenges operations.<ref name=Ludwig3>{{cite web|url= http://automotivelogistics.media/intelligence/volkswagen-audi-mexico-part-3-building-extra-level-efficiency |title=Volkswagen & Audi in Mexico part 3: Building in an extra level of efficiency |first=Christopher |last=Ludwig |date=19 July 2016|publisher=Automotive Logistics|access-date=13 May 2017|quote=Volkswagen is set to lose a dedicated, covered parking garage for 4,000 vehicles that it has used for 30 years, which the port authority plans to redevelop for tourism.}}</ref> The port handles 700,000 to 800,000 vehicles per year; the largest volume on the continent.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://automotivelogistics.media/data/north-american-ports-slowdown-growth-tests-capacity-cope |title=North American ports: Slowdown after growth tests capacity to cope |first=Marcus |last=Williams |date=5 July 2017 |publisher=Automotive Logistics |access-date=3 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803195428/https://automotivelogistics.media/data/north-american-ports-slowdown-growth-tests-capacity-cope |archive-date=3 August 2017 |url-status=dead |quote=Veracruz, which was the continent's largest vehicle-handling port for the sixth time in seven years. }}</ref>
