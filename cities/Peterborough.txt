'''Peterborough''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Peterborough.ogg|ˈ|p|iː|t|ə(r)|b|ər|ə|,_|-|b|ʌr|ə}} {{respell|PEE|tər|bər|ə|,_-|burr|ə}}) is a [[City status in the United Kingdom|cathedral city]] in the [[City of Peterborough]] district in the ceremonial county of [[Cambridgeshire]], England. For centuries, the city and many of its surrounding villages formed the [[Soke of Peterborough]], in the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[Northamptonshire]]. The Soke of Peterborough had an [[Soke of Peterborough County Council|independent county council]], based in the city, between 1889 and 1965. After the Soke of Peterborough was abolished in 1965, the city formed part of the short-lived [[Huntingdon and Peterborough]] until 1974. Though the city has a long history as part of Northamptonshire (from the Middle Ages up to 1965), the city has been part of Cambridgeshire since 1974, and is the largest settlement in that county. 

The city is {{Convert|74|mi|km}} north of London, on the [[River Nene]] which flows into [[The Wash]] {{Convert|27|mi|km}} to the north-east; the [[City status in the United Kingdom|cathedral city]] of [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] is {{Convert|24|mi|km}} east-southeast across the [[The Fens|Fens]] and the university city of [[Cambridge]] is {{Convert|30|mi|km}} to the southeast. The local topography is flat, and in some places, the land lies below sea level, for example in parts of the Fens to the east and to the south of Peterborough. Human settlement in the area began before the [[Bronze Age]], as can be seen at the [[Flag Fen]] archaeological site to the east of the current city centre, also with evidence of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] occupation. The [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] period saw the establishment of a monastery, [[Medeshamstede]], which later became [[Peterborough Cathedral]].

As of the 2021 census the [[Built-up area sub division|built-up area subdivision]] had a population of 192,178. In 2021 the Unitary Authority area had a population of 215,671.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.peterborough.gov.uk/council/about-peterborough/population/ |title=population estimate for Peterborough local authority is 202,110 at mid 2017 |publisher=Peterborough City Council |access-date=14 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110014314/https://www.peterborough.gov.uk/council/about-peterborough/population/ |archive-date=10 January 2019 |url-status=live}}<br/>{{cite web |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/eastofengland/peterborough/E35001389__peterborough/ |title=Peterborough |publisher=City Population De. |access-date=7 August 2022}}<br/>{{Cite web |title=TS001 – Number of usual residents in households and communal establishments – Nomis – Official Census and Labour Market Statistics |url=https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/datasets/c2021ts001 |access-date=14 November 2022 |website=nomisweb.co.uk}}</ref> The population grew rapidly after the railways along with industry, the town became known for brick manufacture, arrived in the 19th century. After the Second World War, industrial employment fell and growth was limited until its designation as a [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] in the 1960s. The town's main economic sectors are financial services and distribution.

==History==
=== Toponymy ===
The original name of the town was [[Medeshamstede]]. The town's name changed to ''Burgh'' from the late tenth century, possibly after Abbot Kenulf had built a [[defensive wall]] around the abbey which was dedicated to [[Saint Peter]]; eventually this developed into the form Peterborough. In the 12th century, the town was also known as ''Gildenburgh'', which is found in the Peterborough version of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' (see Peterborough Chronicle below) and a history of the abbey by the monk [[Hugh Candidus]].<ref>Garmonsway (pp.183 & 198–99); Mellows, 1949 (p.66). As a modern local historian has put it, this was "a rhetorical term," used in these 12th century local histories "to contrast the riches of the late Anglo-Saxon monastery with the decrease in income caused by later impositions and the despoliation of the monastic treasure by Hereward," see Tebbs, Herbert F. ''Peterborough: A History'' (p.23) The Oleander Press, Cambridge, 1979.</ref> The town does not appear to have been a [[Ancient borough|borough]] until at least the 12th century.<ref>Originating in a new name for the abbey at Medeshamstede, and not the town, the name ''Burh'' was adopted for the abbey in the late 10th century, see Garmonsway (p. 117), also Mellows, William Thomas (ed.) ''The Chronicle of Hugh Candidus a Monk of Peterborough'' (pp.38 & 480) Oxford University Press, 1949, {{OCLC|314897451}}; the addition of ''Peter'', the name of the abbey's principal titular saint, parallels development of e.g. the name [[Bury St. Edmunds Abbey|Bury St. Edmunds]] and will have served to distinguish between the two places. Exemplified in mediaeval records in the [[Medieval Latin|Latinised]] form {{Lang|la-x-medieval|Burgus Sancti Petri}}, this gave rise to the modern name Peterborough.</ref>

=== Early history ===
Peterborough and its surrounding areas around have been inhabited for thousands of years because it is where permanently drained land in [[The Fens]] is created by the [[River Nene]]. Remains of Iron Age settlement and what is thought to be religious activity can be seen at the [[Flag Fen]] archaeological site to the east of the city centre. The Romans established a fortified garrison town at [[Durobrivae (Water Newton)|Durobrivae]] on [[Ermine Street]], {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} to the west in Water Newton, around the middle of the 1st century AD. Durobrivae's earliest appearance among surviving records is in the [[Antonine Itinerary]] of the late 2nd century.<ref>Parthey, Gustav and Pinder, Moritz (eds.)

Peterborough is shown by its original name Medeshamstede to have possibly been an [[Angles (tribe)|Anglian]] settlement before AD&nbsp;655, when [[Sexwulf]] founded a monastery on land granted to him for that purpose by [[Peada of Mercia]], who converted to [[Christianity]] and was briefly ruler of the smaller [[Middle Angles]] sub-group. His brother [[Wulfhere of Mercia|Wulfhere]] murdered his own sons, similarly converted and then finished the monastery by way of [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]].<ref name=lewis>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=51211 |title=Peterborough |editor=Samuel Lewis |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year=1848 |work=A Topographical Dictionary of England |access-date=11 May 2013 |author-link=Samuel Lewis (publisher) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003153840/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=51211 |archive-date=3 October 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Hereward the Wake]] rampaged through the town in 1069 or 1070. Outraged, Abbot Turold erected a fort or castle, which, from his name, was called Mont Turold: this mound, or hill, is on the outside of the deanery garden, now called Tout Hill, although in 1848 Tot-hill or Toot Hill.<ref name=Touthill>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1006846|desc=Touthill and site of castle bailey |access-date=11 May 2013}} [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]]</ref> The [[abbey]] church was rebuilt and greatly enlarged in the 12th century.<ref name=TTB>Tim Tatton-Brown and John Crook, ''The English Cathedral'', New Holland (2002) {{ISBN|1-84330-120-2}}</ref> The [[Peterborough Chronicle]], a version of the Anglo-Saxon one, contains unique information about the [[history of England]] after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]], written here by monks in the 12th century.<ref>[[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]], MS.

When [[English Civil War|civil war]] broke out, Peterborough was divided between supporters of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] and the [[Long Parliament]]. The city lay on the border of the [[Eastern Association]] of counties which sided with Parliament, and the war reached Peterborough in 1643 when soldiers arrived in the city to attack Royalist strongholds at [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]] and [[Crowland]]. The Royalist forces were defeated within a few weeks and retreated to [[Burghley House]], where they were captured and sent to [[Cambridge]].<ref>Davies, Elizabeth et al.

Among the privileges claimed by the abbot as early as the 13th century was that of having a prison for felons taken in the [[Soke of Peterborough]], a [[Liberty (division)|liberty]] within [[Northamptonshire]]. This afforded it administrative and judicial independence from the rest of the county, with it having a [[quarter sessions]] separate from the rest of Northamptonshire from 1349.<ref name="brandon-peterborough-past">{{cite book |last1=Brandon |first1=David |last2=Knight |first2=John |title=Peterborough Past |date=2001 |publisher=Phillimore |isbn=9781860771842}}</ref> In 1576 Bishop [[Edmund Scambler]] sold the [[Lord paramount|lordship]] of the hundred of ''Nassaburgh'', which was coextensive with the Soke, to Queen [[Elizabeth I]], who gave it to [[Lord Burghley]], and from that time until the 19th century he and his descendants, the Earls and [[Marquess of Exeter|Marquesses of Exeter]], had a separate gaol for prisoners arrested in the Soke.<ref name=chisholm/> The abbot formerly held four fairs, of which two, St. Peter's Fair, granted in 1189 and later held on the second Tuesday and Wednesday in July, and the Brigge Fair, granted in 1439 and later held on the first Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday in October, were purchased by the [[municipal corporation|corporation]] from the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]] in 1876. The Bridge Fair, as it is now known, granted to the abbey by [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]], survives.<ref>"At the bridge of Peterborough by the River Nene, as well in the county of Huntingdon as in the county of Northampton, on all sides of the bridge."</ref> Prayers for the opening of the fair were once said at the morning service in the cathedral, followed by a civic proclamation and a sausage lunch at the [[Peterborough Town Hall|town hall]] which still takes place. The mayor traditionally leads a procession from the town hall to the fair where the proclamation is read, asking all persons to "behave soberly and civilly, and to pay their just dues and demands according to the laws of the realm and the rights of the City of Peterborough".<ref>Tebbs (p.125).</ref>

=== Modern history ===
Railway lines began operating locally during the 1840s, but it was the 1850 opening of the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]]'s line from London to {{rws|York}} that transformed Peterborough from a market town to an industrial centre. [[Brownlow Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Exeter|Lord Exeter]] had opposed the railway passing through Stamford, so Peterborough, situated between two main terminals at London and [[Doncaster]], increasingly developed as a regional hub.<ref>Brooks, John [web.archive.org/web/20050513152328/http://www.towns.org.uk/market-towns-projects/Market-Towns-Food-and-Tourism-Guides~3.pdf {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025090608/http://www.towns.org.uk/market-towns-projects/Market-Towns-Food-and-Tourism-Guides~3.pdf |date=25 October 2007 }} A Flavour of the Welland] (p.12) The Welland Partnership and Jarrold Publishing, Norwich, 2004.</ref>

Coupled with vast local clay deposits, the railway enabled large scale brickmaking and distribution to take place. The area was the UK's leading producer of bricks for much of the twentieth century. Brick-making had been a small seasonal craft since the early nineteenth century, but during the 1890s successful experiments at [[Fletton, Peterborough|Fletton]] using the harder clays from a lower level had resulted in a much more efficient process.<ref>Davies (pp.23–24).</ref> The market dominance during this period of the [[London Brick Company]], founded by the prolific Scottish builder and architect [[John Cathles Hill]], gave rise to some of the country's most well-known landmarks, all built using the ubiquitous Fletton Brick.<ref>[http://www.hanson.co.uk/samples/pdfs/Brick%20and%20cladding/London%20brick%20130%20years%20of%20history.pdf London Brick: 130 Years of History 1877–2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529072411/http://www.hanson.co.uk/samples/pdfs/Brick%20and%20cladding/London%20brick%20130%20years%20of%20history.pdf |date=29 May 2008 }} Hanson Building Products, 2007.</ref> [[Perkins Engines]] was established in Peterborough in 1932 by [[Frank Perkins (engineer)|Frank Perkins]], creator of the Perkins diesel engine.

In recent years Peterborough has undergone significant changes with numerous developments underway, most notably are Fletton Quays, a project to construct 350 apartments, various office spaces as well as a new home for [[Peterborough City Council]] with other projects within the development to include a [[Hilton Garden Inn]] hotel with a sky bar, a new passport office and various leisure, restaurant and retail opportunities. Other projects within the city include the extension to [[Queensgate shopping centre, United Kingdom|Queensgate Shopping Centre]], The Great Northern Hotel and more recently plans to extend the [[Peterborough railway station|railway station]] and long stay car park to facilitate more office space in the city centre and further parking.

In 2020 planning permission was granted for a new university, [https://www.aru.ac.uk/peterborough ARU Peterborough], which subsequently opened its doors in September 2022 on Bishops Road, a five-minute walk from the City Centre. It is an employment focused university run by [[Anglia Ruskin University]] with four faculties: Business, Innovation and Entrepreneurship; Creative and Digital Arts and Sciences; Agriculture, Environment and Sustainability; Health and Education. The new university took its first cohort of students in 2022, expecting to recruit up to 12,500 by 2028. ARU Peterborough is not expected to receive its degree awarding powers before 2030 when a review will take place to determine its future as part of Anglia Ruskin University or whether it should become its own entity.

The area governed by the city council is the [[non-metropolitan district|district]] of [[City of Peterborough|Peterborough]], which extends beyond the urban area of Peterborough itself to include surrounding villages and rural areas, particularly to the north-west and north-east. Peterborough's [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] is formally held by the local government district rather than the urban area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=46334|page=7419|date=28 June 1974}}</ref> Much of the Peterborough urban area is [[unparished area|unparished]], but some of the suburbs are included in [[civil parishes]], including [[Bretton, Peterborough|Bretton]], [[Hampton Hargate and Vale]], [[Orton Longueville]], and [[Orton Waterville]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Election Maps |url=https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/election-maps/gb/ |publisher=Ordnance Survey |access-date=27 May 2024}}</ref>

===Administrative history===
Peterborough was an [[ancient parish]], which was historically in the [[Nassaburgh hundred]] of [[Northamptonshire]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Peterborough Ancient Parish / Civil Parish |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10279690 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=27 May 2024}}</ref> The parish was divided into five [[Hamlet (place)|hamlets]] or townships: [[Dogsthorpe]], [[Eastfield, Peterborough|Eastfield]], [[Longthorpe]], [[Newark, Peterborough|Newark]] and a Peterborough township covering the central part of the parish including the town. Within the Peterborough township was an [[extra-parochial area]] known as the Minster Precincts, covering St Peter's Abbey and its [[Cathedral close|close]]. When the former abbey church became [[Peterborough Cathedral]] in 1541, Peterborough was thereafter deemed to be a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]]. The area originally holding city status was the Peterborough township plus the Minster Precincts.<ref name=1832commissioners>{{cite book |title=Reports from Commissioners on proposed division of Counties and boundaries of Boroughs: Volume II, Part II |date=1832 |page=159 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vEhJAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA156-IA7 |access-date=27 May 2024}}</ref>

Although made a city in 1541, at that time Peterborough was not a [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough]] (despite including the word in its name). Prior to the [[dissolution of the monasteries|dissolution]] of the abbey in 1539, the abbey had been the [[manorialism|manorial]] owner of the town; that ownership passed to the new cathedral authorities. A [[Peterborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Peterborough constituency]] was also created in 1541, covering the same area as the city.<ref name=1832commissioners/><ref>{{cite web |title=Peterborough |url=https://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/constituencies/peterborough |website=The History of Parliament |access-date=27 May 2024}}</ref>

In 1790 a body of [[improvement commissioners]] was established to provide public services in the city.<ref>{{cite web |title=Local Government archives |url=https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/residents/libraries-leisure-culture/archives/archives-a-to-z/archives-a-to-z-l-to-m |website=Cambridgeshire County Council |access-date=27 May 2024}}</ref> In 1874 Peterborough was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]], with the commissioners replaced by an elected council initially comprising a mayor, six [[aldermen]] and eighteen [[councillors]].<ref>Under the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]] ([[5 & 6 Will. 4]]. c. 76), Charter of Incorporation dated 17 March 1874.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Peterborough Municipal Borough |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10136805#tab02 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=27 May 2024}}</ref>

The municipal borough was abolished in 1974 when the modern district was created, being a lower tier [[non-metropolitan district]], with the area also being transferred to Cambridgeshire at the same time.<ref>[[Local Government Act 1972]]</ref> In 1998 the Peterborough district was removed from the [[non-metropolitan county]] of Cambridgeshire (the area governed by [[Cambridgeshire County Council]]) to become a unitary authority, whilst remaining part of the [[ceremonial county]] of Cambridgeshire for the purposes of [[Lord-lieutenant|lieutenancy]] and [[shrievalty]].<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=si|si=The Cambridgeshire (City of Peterborough) (Structural, Boundary and Electoral Changes) Order 1996|year=1996|number=1878|access-date=27 May 2024}}</ref>

Peterborough's population growth was reportedly the second fastest of any British city over the ten years from 2004 to 2013, driven partly by immigration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/business/business-news/peterborough-loses-top-spot-as-uk-s-fastest-growing-city-in-new-report-1-6526432 |title=Peterborough loses top spot as UK's fastest growing city in new report |first=Paul |last=Grinnell |work=Peterborough Telegraph |date=19 January 2015 |access-date=9 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710125244/http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/business/business-news/peterborough-loses-top-spot-as-uk-s-fastest-growing-city-in-new-report-1-6526432 |archive-date=10 July 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Peterborough is home to one of the largest concentrations of [[Italian diaspora|Italian immigrants]] in the UK. This is mainly as a result of [[workforce|labour]] recruitment in the 1950s by the London Brick Company in the southern Italian regions of [[Apulia]] and [[Campania]]. By 1960, approximately 3,000 Italian men were employed by London Brick, mostly at the [[Fletton]] works.<ref>Colpi, Terry ''The Italian Factor: The Italian Community in Great Britain'' (p.149) Mainstream Publishing, Edinburgh, 1991.</ref> In 1962, the [[Missionaries of St. Charles Borromeo|Scalabrini Fathers]], who first arrived in 1956, purchased an old school and converted it into a mission church named after the [[patron saint]] of workers [[Saint Joseph]] (San Giuseppe).

According to a report published by the police in 2007, recent migration had resulted in increased translation costs and a change in the nature of crime in the county, with an increase in [[Driving under the influence|drink driving]] offences, knife crime and an international dimension added to activities such as running [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] factories and [[trafficking in human beings|human trafficking]]. The number of foreign nationals arrested in the north of the county rose from 894 in 2003, to 2,435 in 2006, but the report also said that "inappropriately negative" community perceptions about migrant workers often complicate routine incidents, raising tensions and turning them "critical". It also noted there was "little evidence that the increased numbers of migrant workers have caused significant or systematic problems in respect of community safety or cohesion".<ref>[http://www.cambs.police.uk/images/newsitem/download/190907growth.pdf The changing demography of Cambridgeshire: implications for policing] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927113505/http://www.cambs.police.uk/images/newsitem/download/190907growth.pdf |date=27 September 2007 }} Cambridgeshire Constabulary and Cambridgeshire Police Authority, 19 September 2007.</ref> In 2007, [[Julie Spence]], the then [[Chief Constable]] emphasised that the fact that the demographic profile of Cambridgeshire had changed dramatically from one where 95% of teenagers were white four years previously to one of the country's fastest growing diverse populations, and said it had a positive impact on development and jobs.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/sep/20/immigrationandpublicservices.immigration |title=Ministers to assess migrant groups' impact on public services |first=Alan |last=Travis |work=The Guardian |date=20 September 2007 |access-date=16 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716101608/http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/sep/20/immigrationandpublicservices.immigration |archive-date=16 July 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> In 2008, the [[BBC]] broadcast ''The Poles are Coming!'', a controversial documentary on the impact of [[Polish people|Polish]] migration to Peterborough by [[Tim Samuels]], as part of its ''White Season''.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/white/poles.shtml The Poles are Coming!] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323024639/http://www.bbc.co.uk/white/poles.shtml |date=23 March 2008 }} Is white working class Britain becoming invisible?

[[Peterborough Cathedral]], formally the Cathedral Church of [[Saint Peter]], [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] and [[Saint Andrew]], whose statues look down from the three high gables of the West Front, was founded as a [[monastery]] in AD&nbsp;655 and re-built in its present form between 1118 and 1238. It has been the seat of the Bishop of Peterborough since the [[diocese]] was created in 1541, when the last abbot was made the first bishop and the abbot's house was converted into the episcopal palace.<ref name=lewis/> Peterborough Cathedral is one of the most intact large [[Romanesque architecture|Norman]] buildings in England and is renowned for its imposing early [[English Gothic architecture|English Gothic]] West Front which, with its three enormous arches, is without [[Cathedral architecture of Western Europe|architectural precedent]] and with no direct successor. The cathedral has the distinction of having had two queens buried beneath its paving: [[Catherine of Aragon]] and [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. The remains of Queen Mary were removed to [[Westminster Abbey]] by her son [[James VI and I|James I]] when he became King of England.<ref name=Sweeting>Sweeting, Walter Debenham ''The Cathedral Church of Peterborough: A Description of its Fabric and a Brief History of the Episcopal See'' (pp.3–35) G.

The general layout of Peterborough is attributed to Martin de Vecti who, as abbot from 1133 to 1155, rebuilt the settlement on dry limestone to the west of the monastery, rather than the often-flooded marshlands to the east. Abbot Martin was responsible for laying out the market place and the wharf beside the river. Peterborough's 17th-century [[Peterborough Guildhall|Guildhall]] was built in 1671 by John Lovin, who also restored the bishop's palace shortly after the [[Stuart Restoration|restoration]] of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. It stands on columns, providing an open ground floor for the butter and poultry markets which used to be held there. The Market Place was renamed Cathedral Square and the adjacent Gates Memorial Fountain moved to Bishop's Road Gardens in 1963, when the (then weekly) market was transferred to the site of the old cattle market.<ref>Skinner, Julia (with particular reference to the work of Robert Cook) ''Did You Know?

[[Peterscourt]] on City Road was designed by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]] in 1864, housing St. Peter's Teacher Training College for men until 1938.

[[Peterborough Museum and Art Gallery]], built in 1816, housed the city's first infirmary from 1857 to 1928. The museum has a collection of some 227,000 objects, including local archaeology and social history, from the products of the Roman pottery industry to Britain's oldest known murder victim; a collection of marine fossil remains from the [[Jurassic]] period of international importance; the manuscripts of [[John Clare]], the "Northamptonshire Peasant Poet" as he was commonly known in his own time;<ref>Grainger, Margaret ''A Descriptive Catalogue of the John Clare Collection'' Peterborough Museum and Art Gallery, 1973.</ref> and the Norman Cross collection of items made by French prisoners of war. These prisoners were kept at [[Norman Cross Prison|Norman Cross]] on the outskirts of Peterborough from 1797 to 1814, in what is believed to be the world's first purpose-built prisoner of war camp. The art collection contains an impressive variety of paintings, prints and drawings dating from the 1600s to the present day. Peterborough Museum also holds regular temporary exhibitions, weekend events and guided tours.

The [[John Clare Cottage]] in the village of Helpston was purchased by the John Clare Trust in 2005.

[[Flag Fen]], the Bronze Age archaeological site, was discovered in 1982, when a team led by Dr [[Francis Pryor]] carried out a [[Archaeological field survey|survey]] of [[Dike (construction)|dykes]] in the area. Probably religious, it comprises a large number of poles arranged in five long rows, connecting [[Whittlesey]] with Peterborough across the wet fenland.

East Anglia is most notable for being almost flat (it is mainly on a floodplain).

=== Linguistics ===
Peterborough lies in the middle of several distinct regional accent groups and as such has a hybrid of Fenland [[East Anglian English|East Anglian]], [[East Midlands English|East Midland]] and London [[Estuary English]] features. The city falls just north of the A vowel [[isogloss]] and as such most native speakers will use the [[Phonological history of English short A|flat A]], as found in ''cat'', in words such as ''last''. [[Yod-dropping|''Yod''-dropping]] is often heard from Peterborians, as in the rest of East Anglia, for example ''new'' as {{IPA|/nuː/}}. However, the large number of newcomers has impacted greatly on the [[English English|English]] spoken by the younger generation. Common so-called Estuary English features such as [[L-vocalization|''L''-vocalisation]], [[T glottalization|T glottalisation]] and [[Th-fronting|''Th''-fronting]] give today's Peterborough accent a definite [[South East of England|south-eastern]] sound.<ref>Britain, David [http://www.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/papers/errl_41c.pdf Surviving Estuary English: Innovation diffusion, koineisation and local dialect differentiation in the English Fenland] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927113505/http://www.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/papers/errl_41c.pdf |date=27 September 2007 }} Essex Research Reports in Linguistics, vol.41 (pp.74–103) University of Essex, Department of Language and Linguistics, 2002.</ref>

=== Affiliations ===
{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in the United Kingdom}}
[[Town twinning]] started in Europe after the Second World War. Its purpose was to promote friendship and greater understanding between the people of different European cities. A twinning link is a formal, long-term friendship agreement involving co-operation between two communities in different countries and endorsed by both local authorities. The two communities organise projects and activities addressing a range of issues and develop an understanding of historical, cultural, lifestyle similarities and differences. Peterborough is twinned with the following municipalities:<ref>[http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/business/business-news/peterborough-s-twin-towns-1-126722 "Peterborough's twin towns"] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072304/http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/business/business-news/peterborough-s-twin-towns-1-126722 |date=4 March 2016 }}, ''Peterborough Evening Telegraph'', 11 March 2009.</ref>
