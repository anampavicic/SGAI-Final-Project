'''San Miguel''' ({{IPA|es|ˈsam miˈɣel}}) is a [[city]] in eastern [[El Salvador]]. It is the country's third most populous city. It is located {{Convert|138|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the capital, [[San Salvador]]. It is also the capital of  [[San Miguel Department, El Salvador|the department of San Miguel]] and a municipality. The population of the city in 2017 was 518,410.

==History==
[[Luis de Moscoso Alvarado]] established the village of San Miguel de la Frontera (Saint Michael of the Frontier) on May 8, 1530, as a bastion for the conquest of the [[Lenca people|Lenca]] kingdom of Chaparrastique (Place of Beautiful Orchids).<ref name="boland">{{cite book|first = Roy|last = Boland|title = Culture and Customs of El Salvador|location = London|publisher = Greenwood Press|year = 2001|pages = [https://archive.org/details/culturecustomsof00bola/page/4 4, 13, 14]|isbn = 0-313-30620-6|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/culturecustomsof00bola/page/4}}</ref> By 1586 the village had obtained the title of [[city]].

In 1655, a volcanic eruption almost destroyed the entire city. According to legend, the devastation was so severe that only an image of Mary in the parish church was spared.<ref name="boland"/>

==Economy==
The city has been an important center of the agriculture, textile and chemical industries of [[El Salvador]]. Since the early 21st century, the services sector, especially health care and commerce, have increased considerably, resulting in significant private investments in hospitals and shopping malls within the city. This has usually been attributed partly to the high inflow of remittances (at least 35% of the total, which represents around 18% of the national GDP <ref>[http://www.pnud.org.sv/migraciones/static/biblioteca/07_BCR_Garcia_Xiomara_caracterisiticas_de_los_remitentes.pdf "CARACTERÍSTICAS DE LOS REMITENTES DE REMESAS FAMILIARES DESDE ESTADOS UNIDOS"]</ref>) that Salvadorans living abroad send to families in the eastern zone of the country.

The incomes and wealth of the eastern half of the country are expected to increase following new jobs and businesses associated with the development of the [[La Unión, El Salvador|Puerto La Unión]]; it started operations in 2012.{{cn|date=February 2023}}

==Education==
There are many educational institutions within the city, private and public, including some of the oldest schools in the country. The main universities are the public [[University of El Salvador]] ( with its Facultad Multidiciplinaria de Oriente) and the private Universidad de Oriente (UNIVO).The University Gerardo Barrios, the University Modular Abierta.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

[[File:Fdpt18102006bmcha43c.jpg|thumb|left|San Miguel at night]]
In November, San Miguel celebrates its municipal festivities in honor of "Nuestra Señora De La Paz" (Our Lady of Peace),  the San Miguel Carnival being the final and main event that takes place on the last Saturday of the month. With an estimate of 1,000,000 people attending it for its 50th anniversary (as reported by the local media), it is considered the biggest entertainment, music and food festival in El Salvador and one of the largest in Central America. The beginnings of the Carnival itself date from 1959. Currently, this tradition continues to reflect the growth of the city and one of the motors for its economy.

[[File:San Miguel Roosevelt 2011.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Roosevelt Avenue at night]] San Miguel is famous for its night life along Roosevelt Avenue, the main thoroughfare that slices the city in half. One of those halves includes places of historical interest such as the Cathedral of "Nuestra Señora de la Paz" (1862), Guzman Park, [[Francisco Gavidia]] Theater (1909) and the Palacio Municipal (1935). The other half, modern San Miguel, includes new neighborhoods called "colonias."

Famous people born in San Miguel include Captain General Gerado Barrios, writer [[Francisco Gavidia]], poet Juan J. Cañas, and [[David Joaquín Guzmán]]. The city is flanked by the [[Chaparrastique|Volcan Chaparrastique]] (2,129 meters), perhaps the most iconic image of San Miguel.

San Miguel is a sister city of [[Arlington, Virginia]].

==Geography==
The city is located 138&nbsp;km east of the capital, [[San Salvador]]. The [[San Miguel (volcano)|San Miguel Volcano]] or known as Volcán Chaparrastique is a [[stratovolcano]], approximately {{convert|11|km}} from the city. The volcano last erupted on November 16,2022.
