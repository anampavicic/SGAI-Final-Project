==Names==
Šiauliai is referred to by various names in different languages: [[Samogitian language|Samogitian]] {{lang|sgs|Šiaulē}}, [[Latvian language|Latvian]] {{lang|lv|Saule}} (historic) and {{lang|lv|Šauļi}} (modern), [[Polish language|Polish]] {{lang|pl|Szawle}}, [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|Schaulen}}, {{IPA|de|ˈʃaʊ̯lən|pron|De-Schaulen.ogg}}, Russian {{lang|ru|Шавли}} ({{lang|ru-Latn|Shavli}} – historic) and {{lang|ru|Шяуля́й}} ({{lang|ru-Latn|Shyaulyai}} – modern), [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] {{lang|yi|שאַװל}} ({{lang|yi-Latn|Shavel}}).<ref name="Siauliai-Saule"/><ref name="SiauliaiVle">{{cite web |title=Šiauliai |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/siauliai-1/ |website=[[Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija]] |access-date=26 March 2023 |language=lt}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Šiauliai church in 19th c.jpg|thumb|Šiauliai church, 19th century]]
[[File:Calle Vilnius, Siauliai, Lituania, 2012-08-09, DD 01.JPG|thumb|250px|Vilnius Street in Šiauliai]]
[[File:Chaimas Frenkelis Villa - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|250px|Chaimas Frenkelis Villa]]
The city was first mentioned in written sources as ''Soule'' in [[Livonian Order]] chronicles describing the [[Battle of Saule]].<ref name="Siauliai-Saule">{{cite web |last1=Kiaupa |first1=Zigmantas |last2=Nikžentaitis |first2=Alvydas |title=Šiauliai (Saulė) |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/siauliai/ |website=Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija |access-date=26 March 2023 |language=lt}}</ref> Thus the city's founding date is now considered to be 22 September 1236, the same date when the battle took place, not far from Šiauliai.<ref name="Siauliai-Saule"/> At first, it developed as a defence post against the raids by the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic]] and [[Livonian Order]]s. After the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410, the raids stopped and Šiauliai started to develop as an agricultural settlement. In 1445, a wooden church was built. It was replaced in 1625 with the brick church which can be seen in the city center today.<ref name = "Town history">{{Cite web |title= History of the city |url= http://edem.siauliai.lt/History671 |publisher= Šiauliai |access-date= August 22, 2016 }}</ref>

Šiauliai was granted [[Magdeburg rights|Magdeburg city rights]] in the 16th century when it also became an administrative centre of the area.<ref name="SiauliuIstorija">{{cite web |title=Šiaulių istorija |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/siauliu-istorija/ |website=Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija |access-date=26 March 2023 |language=lt}}</ref> However, in the 16th to 18th centuries the city was devastated by [[Deluge (history)|The Deluge]] and epidemics of the [[Bubonic plague]].<ref name = "Town history" /><ref name="SiauliuIstorija"/>

The credit for the city's rebirth goes to [[Antoni Tyzenhaus]] (1733–1785) who after a violent revolt of peasants of the Crown properties in Northern Lithuania (so-called in Polish: Powstanie Szawelskie, 1769), started the radical economic and urban reforms.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Galia ir tradicija.

Šiauliai grew to become a well-developed city, with several prominent brick buildings.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In 1791 [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]], king of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], confirmed once again that Šiauliai's city rights and granted it a [[coat of arms]] which depicted a bear, the symbol of [[Samogitia]], the [[Eye of Providence]], and a red bull, the symbol of the Poniatowski family. The modern coat of arms has been modelled after this version.

After the [[Partitions of Poland]], Šiauliai received a new coat of arms. The city grew and became an important educational and cultural centre. Also, infrastructure was rapidly developing: in 1836–1858 a road connecting [[Riga]] and [[Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Tilsit]] was built, in 1871 a [[Libau–Romny Railway|railroad connecting Liepāja with Romny]] was built.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cohen-Mushlin |first1=Aliza |last2=Kravtsov |first2=Sergey |last3=Levin |first3=Vladimir |last4=Mickūnaitė |first4=Giedrė |last5=Šiaučiūnaitė-Verbickienė |first5=Jurgita |title=Synagogues in Lithuania N-Ž: A Catalogue |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tS-PMqoj1EIC&q=riga+tilsit+railroad+1871&pg=PA127 |publisher=VDA leidykla |access-date=January 24, 2019 |language=en |date=2010|isbn=9786094470042 }}</ref> Šiauliai, being in a crossroad of important merchant routes, started to develop as an industrial town. Already in 1897, it was the third-largest city in Lithuania with a population of about 16,000. The demographics changed also: 56.4% of the inhabitants were Jewish in 1909. Šiauliai was known for its leather industry. Chaim Frenkel owned the biggest leather factory in the [[Russian Empire]].

===World War I and independent Lithuania===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2007-0178, Baltikum, Ruinen in Schaulen.jpg|thumb|Šiauliai after the First World War]]
During World War I, about 85% of the buildings were burned down and the city centre was destroyed.<ref name = "Town history" /> After the war and re-establishment of Lithuania, the importance of Šiauliai grew. Before [[Klaipėda]] was attached to Lithuania, the city was second after Kaunas by [[population size]]. By 1929 the city centre was rebuilt. Modern utilities were also included: streets were lighted and there was public transportation, telephone and telegraph lines, [[water supply network]] and [[sanitary sewer|sewer]].

The first years of independence were difficult because the industrial city lost its markets in Russia. It needed to find new clients in Western Europe. In 1932, a railroad to Klaipėda was built and it connected the city to the Western markets. In 1938, the city produced about 85% of Lithuania's leather, 60% of footwear, 75% of [[flax]] fibre and 35% of candies. Culture also flourished as many new periodicals were printed, new schools and universities opened, a library, theatre, museum, and conventional school opened.

===World War II===
{{see also|Šiauliai Ghetto|Šiauliai Offensive}}
In 1939, one-fifth of the city's population was Jewish.<ref>{{cite web|last=Urieli|first=Assaf|title=Shavl – שאַװל – Šiauliai, Lithuania|url=http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/shavli/shavli1.html|work=Kehila Links|publisher=JewishGen|access-date=April 26, 2012}}</ref> [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German soldiers]] entered Šiauliai on June 26, 1941. The first mass murder of Šiauliai Jews was perpetrated in the Kužiai forest, about 12 kilometres outside Šiauliai, on June 29, 1941. According to one of the Jewish survivors of Šiauliai, [[Nesse Godin]], some 700 people were shot in nearby woods during the first weeks of occupation after having been forced to dig their own graves. Beginning on July 29, 1941, and continuing throughout the summer, the Germans murdered about 8,000 Jews from Šiauliai and the Šiauliai region in the Kužiai forest. One hundred twenty-five Jews from [[Linkuva]] were also murdered there, along with ethnic Lithuanian and Russian members of the Communist Party and the Communist Youth.<ref name=HAL89>{{cite web |url= http://www.holocaustatlas.lt/EN/#a_atlas/search//page/2/item/89/  |title= Mass Murder of the Šiauliai Jews at Kužiai Forest |year=2010 |work= Holocaust Atlas of Lithuania |publisher=Vilna Gaon State Jewish Museum| location= Vilnius, Lithuania}}</ref>

The [[Šiauliai Ghetto]] was established in July 1941. There were two [[Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe|Jewish ghetto]] areas in Šiauliai, one in the Kaukas suburb, and one in Trakų. During World War II, the Jewish population was reduced from 8,000 to 500. Approximately 80% of the buildings were destroyed.<ref name=EJ>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Levin |first=Dov|encyclopedia= Encyclopaedia Judaica |title= Šiauliai |year=2008|publisher= The Gale Group }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Bubnys|first1=A|title=The Fate of Jews in Šiauliai and Šiauliai Region" – The Šiauliai Ghetto: Lists of Prisoners 1942|date=2002|location=Vilnius}}</ref>

===Soviet era===
[[File:1991 01 13Šiauliai12.jpg|thumb|Šiauliai 13 January 1991, after the Soviet Army killed peaceful civilians during the [[January Events (Lithuania)|January Events]]]]
The city was largely rebuilt anew in a typical Soviet fashion during the years of subsequent [[Occupation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union (1944)|Soviet occupation]].
