'''Dhamar''' ({{langx|ar|ÿ∞ŸéŸÖŸéÿßÿ±|·∏éamƒÅr}}; [[Ancient South Arabian script|Old South Arabian]]: '''ê©πê©£ê©ß''' ''·∏émr'') is a city in south-western [[Yemen]]. It is located at {{coord|14|33|0|N|44|24|6|E|display=inline,title}}, at an elevation of around {{convert|2,400|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

==Overview==
[[File:Dhamar Ali Yahbur (bust).jpg|thumb|left|Dhamar Ali Yahbur II]]

Dhamar is situated {{convert|100|km|mile|abbr=on}} to the south of [[Sana'a]], north of [[Ibb]], and west of [[Al Bayda, Yemen|Al-Bayda']], {{convert|2400|-|2500|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. Its name goes back to the [[Tubba'|king]] of [[Sabaeans|Saba']] and [[Himyarite Kingdom|Dhu-Raydan]] at 15-35 AD, whose name was Dhamar Ali Yahbir II, who is renowned for restoring the great [[Marib Dam|dam of Ma‚Äôrib]], and whose [[statue]] was found at the city of Al-Nakhla Al-Hamra'a ("The Red Palm"). This city is one of the [[Archaeology|archeological]] sites that are found near Dhamar. The city of Dhamar is the capital of the [[Dhamar Governorate|governorate]], and is situated on the main road, which connects Sana‚Äôa with a number of other governorates. This city was one of the prominent Arabian and [[Islam]]ic culture and scientific centers in Yemen {{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}.  Its Great Mosque was built in the period of the [[caliph]] [[Abu Bakr]]. As Dhamar City had a great role in Yemen's political and economic life, it had an important historical role in Yemen before the lifetime of the [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic Prophet]] [[Muhammad]]. The antique Yemeni engravings mentioned Dhamar city as being a very famous center of the Islamic studies and sciences, and many of the great scientists are attributed to this historical town. In past times, the people of Dhamar were known for bringing up [[horse]]s; the city was an early center of horse-breeding in Arabia. The town is still known in Yemen for its numerous historical [[mosque]]s and schools, which are distinguished by their characteristic architecture in harmony with the colours of its volcanic land.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} A [[volcanic field]], [[Harras of Dhamar]], extends {{convert|80|km|mile|abbr=on}} to the east of the city.<ref name="NVP1963">{{citation |last=Neumann van Padang |first=Maur |year=1963 |title=Catalogue of the active volcanoes and solfatara fields of Arabia and the Indian Ocean |location=[[Rome]] |publisher=[[International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior|IAVCEI]] |volume=16 |pages=1‚Äì64 |oclc=886615186 }}</ref>

The city of Dhamar, in the center of the Dhamar basin, is of ancient origin. It was built by the legendary [[Himyarite]] King Dhamar Ali Yahbir II. Dhamar is the only town in the former [[Yemen Arab Republic|North Yemen]] that is not surrounded by a wall or natural defensive formations; it is just a settlement on the plains. Centrally situated with connections to the nearby governorates, the town has prospered as a Wednesday market and meeting place for tribes living nearby. It is home to the [[Thamar University|University of Thamar]], the largest university in the country. [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucians]] associate Dhamar with the mystical city of Damcar‚Äîa city in [[Arabia]] described in the ''[[Fama Fraternitatis]],'' inhabited by scholars and alchemists who studied the lost secrets of [[Hermes Trismegistus]] and [[Solomon]], visited by [[Christian Rosenkreuz]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}
