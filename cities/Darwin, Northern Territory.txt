'''Darwin''' ([[Laragiya language|Larrakia]]: ''{{Lang|lrg|Garramilla}}'')<ref name="ldc">{{cite web | title=Larrakia Development Corporation | website=Larrakia Development Corporation |date =July 2017|url=https://www.larrakia.com.au/ | access-date=4 July 2021}}</ref>{{Better source needed|reason=Native name of the city should be supported by better (more reliable) sources than the one corporate website.|date=April 2024}} is the [[List of Australian capital cities|capital city]] of the [[Northern Territory]], [[Australia]]. The city has nearly 53% of the Northern Territory's population, with 139,902 at the [[2021 Australian census|2021 census]].<ref name="2021census" /> It is the smallest, wettest, and most northerly of the Australian capital cities and serves as the [[Top End]]'s regional centre.

Darwin's proximity to [[Southeast Asia]] makes it a key link between Australia and countries such as [[Indonesia]] and [[Timor-Leste]]. The [[Stuart Highway]] begins in Darwin and extends southerly across central Australia through [[Tennant Creek]] and [[Alice Springs]], concluding in [[Port Augusta, South Australia]]. The city is built upon a low bluff overlooking [[Darwin Harbour]]. Darwin's suburbs begin at [[Lee Point, Northern Territory|Lee Point]] in the north and stretch to [[Berrimah, Northern Territory|Berrimah]] in the east. The Stuart Highway extends to Darwin's eastern [[satellite city]] of [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]] and its suburbs.

The Darwin region, like much of the Top End, has a [[tropical climate]], with a wet and dry season. A period known locally as "the build up" leading up to Darwin's wet season sees temperature and humidity increase. Darwin's wet season typically arrives in late November to early December and brings with it heavy [[monsoon]]al downpours, spectacular lightning displays, and increased cyclone activity.<ref name="GUM">{{cite web | title = Lightning Storms in the Top End |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/scribblygum/december2002/default.htm | date = 10 December 2002 | access-date =27 July 2008 }}</ref> During the dry season, the city has clear skies and mild sea breezes from the harbour.

The [[Larrakia people]] are the [[traditional owners]] of the Darwin area, and Aboriginal people are a significant proportion of the population. On 9 September 1839, {{HMS|Beagle}} sailed into Darwin Harbour during its survey of the area. [[John Clements Wickham]] named the region "Port Darwin" in honour of their former shipmate [[Charles Darwin]], who had sailed with them on the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|ship's previous voyage]].

The first British person to see Darwin harbour appears to have been Lieutenant [[John Lort Stokes]] of {{HMS|Beagle}} on 9 September 1839.

In 1863, the Northern Territory was transferred from [[New South Wales]] to [[South Australia]]. In 1864 South Australia sent [[B. T. Finniss]] north as Government Resident to survey and found a capital for its new territory. Finniss chose a site at [[Escape Cliffs]], near the entrance to Adelaide River, about {{convert|60|km}} northeast of the modern city. This attempt was short-lived, and the settlement abandoned by 1865.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ling|first1=Ted|title=Commonwealth Government Records about the Northern Territory|publisher=National Archives of Australia|isbn=9781920807870|access-date=26 June 2016|page=6|url=http://guides.naa.gov.au/content/20141219-Guide022_tcm48-58753.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309133412/http://guides.naa.gov.au/content/20141219-Guide022_tcm48-58753.pdf|archive-date=9 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> On 5 February 1869, [[George Goyder]], the Surveyor-General of South Australia, established a small settlement of 135 people at Port Darwin between [[Fort Hill, Darwin|Fort Hill]] and the escarpment.

In early 1875 Darwin's [[white people|white population]] had grown to approximately 300 because of the gold rush. On 17 February 1875 the {{SS|Gothenburg}} left Darwin ''en route'' for [[Adelaide]]. The approximately 88 passengers and 34 crew (surviving records vary) included government officials, circuit-court judges, Darwin residents taking their first [[furlough]], and miners. While travelling south along the north Queensland coast, the ''Gothenburg'' encountered a cyclone-strength storm and was wrecked on a section of the [[Great Barrier Reef]]. Only 22 men survived, while between 98 and 112 people perished. Many passengers who perished were Darwin residents, and news of the tragedy severely affected the small community, which reportedly took several years to recover.<ref name="NTLIB">{{cite web |url=http://www.ntlib.nt.gov.au/tracy/advanced/History_Cyclones.html |title=Previous cyclones in Darwin |work=Cyclone Tracy |publisher=Northern Territory Library |date=21 April 1998 |access-date=7 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206005507/http://www.ntlib.nt.gov.au/tracy/advanced/History_Cyclones.html |archive-date=6 February 2008  }}</ref>

In the 1870s, relatively large numbers of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] settled at least temporarily in the Northern Territory; many were contracted to work the goldfields and later to build the Palmerston to Pine Creek railway. By 1888 there were 6,122 Chinese in the Northern Territory, mostly in or around Darwin. The early Chinese settlers were mainly from [[Guangdong Province]]. The Chinese community established [[Chinatown, Darwin|Darwin Chinatown]]. At the end of the 19th century, anti-Chinese feelings grew in response to the 1890s economic depression, and the [[White Australia policy]] meant many Chinese left the territory. But some stayed, became British subjects, and established a commercial base in Darwin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chungwahnt.asn.au/|title=Home|website=Chung Wah Society|access-date=26 January 2019}}</ref>

The Northern Territory was initially settled and administered by [[South Australia]], until its transfer to the [[Australia|Commonwealth]] in 1911. In the same year, the city's official name changed from Palmerston to Darwin.<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Northern-Territory/Darwin/2005/02/17/1108500201604.html/|title=Darwin|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=8 February 2004|location=Darwin, Australia|access-date=2 August 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Darwin 42.jpg|thumb|The Japanese [[Bombing of Darwin|bombings of Darwin]]]]
The period between 1911 and 1919 was filled with political turmoil, particularly with trade union unrest, which culminated on 17 December 1918. Led by [[Harold Nelson (Australian politician)|Harold Nelson]], some 1,000 demonstrators marched to [[Government House, Darwin|Government House]] at Liberty Square in Darwin, where they burnt an [[effigy]] of the [[Administrator of the Northern Territory]], [[John A. Gilruth|John Gilruth]], and demanded his resignation. The incident became known as the [[Darwin Rebellion]]. Their grievances were against the two main Northern Territory employers: [[Vestey Group|Vestey's Meatworks]] and the federal government. Both Gilruth and the Vestey company left Darwin soon afterward.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=William Hughes: timeline |url=https://www.naa.gov.au/explore-collection/australias-prime-ministers/william-hughes/timeline}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Hitch |first=Georgia |orig-date=12 December 2017 |date=12 December 2018 |title=What was the Darwin Rebellion |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-12/curious-darwin-what-was-the-darwin-rebellion/9200424 |access-date=6 April 2024 |website=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref>

In 1931, the 17 remaining patients from the [[leprosarium]] at [[Cossack, Western Australia]] were moved to Darwin, after it closed down. It was at a time when many Aboriginal people who were thought to have [[leprosy]] or other infectious diseases were sent to [[lock hospital]]s and leprosariums under the ''[[Aborigines Act 1905]]'',<ref name="Carr 2022"/><ref>{{cite web | title=Aborigines Act 1905 | website=Find & Connect  | url=https://www.findandconnect.gov.au/guide/wa/WE00406 | access-date=12 July 2022}}</ref> which gave the [[Chief Protector of Aborigines]] powers to arrest and send any [[Indigenous Australian|Indigenous person]] suspected of having a range of diseases to one of these institutions.<ref name="Carr 2022">{{cite web | last=Carr | first=Cameron | title=Archaeologists investigate medical incarceration of Indigenous Australians in leprosariums  | website=ABC News| publisher= [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | date=10 July 2022 | url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-07-11/leprosariums-medically-incarcerated-indigenous-australians/101213394 | access-date=12 July 2022}}</ref>

Around 10,000 Australian and other [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops arrived in Darwin at the outset of World War II to defend Australia's northern coast. On 19 February 1942 at 0957, 188 [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] warplanes [[Bombing of Darwin|attacked Darwin]] in two waves. It was the same fleet that had bombed [[Pearl Harbor]], though considerably more bombs were dropped on Darwin than on Pearl Harbor. The attack killed at least 243 people and caused immense damage to the town, airfields, and aircraft. These were by far the most serious attacks on Australia in time of war, in terms of fatalities and damage. They were the first of [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|many raids]] on Darwin.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

[[Chinatown, Darwin|Darwin Chinatown]] which lay within the heart of Darwin was razed to the ground by the Japanese bombing and was never rebuilt. Northern Territory administrator [[Aubrey Abbott]] wanted to eliminate the Chinese community and forcibly seized their land as it was considered prime real estate.<!-- The statement about Sydney and Newcastle was wrong; there were about 100 air raids, including one on Broome which killed more than 80 people. -->

Darwin was further developed after the war, with sealed roads constructed connecting the region to [[Alice Springs]] to the south and [[Mount Isa]] to the southeast, and [[Manton Dam]] built in the south to provide the city with water. On [[Australia Day]] (26 January) 1959, Darwin was granted city status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australiadaynt.com.au/fun/quiz/quiz2004.html |title=Australia Day (Darwin) |access-date=11 February 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211065041/http://www.australiadaynt.com.au/fun/quiz/quiz2004.html |archive-date=11 February 2006  }}</ref>

===1970–present===
[[File:Town Hall ruins, Darwin, 2023 (01).jpg|thumb|right|Remains of Palmerston Town Hall, destroyed by [[Cyclone Tracy]]]]
On 25 December 1974, Darwin was struck by [[Cyclone Tracy]], which killed 71 people and destroyed over 70% of the city's buildings, including many old stone buildings such as the Palmerston Town Hall, which could not withstand the lateral forces the winds generated. After the disaster, 30,000 of the population of 46,000 were evacuated in the biggest airlift in Australia's history.<ref name="DCC" /> The town was rebuilt with newer materials and techniques during the late 1970s by the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, led by former [[Brisbane]] [[Lord mayor]] [[Clem Jones]]. A [[satellite city]] of [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]] was built {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Darwin in the early 1980s.

On 17 September 2003, the [[Adelaide–Darwin railway]] was completed, with the opening of the Alice Springs–Darwin standard gauge line.

=== Aviation history ===
[[File:Darwin 1921.jpg|thumb|Darwin Aviation Heritage Centre – 1st Ultralight – Hover Bird]]
Darwin hosted many of aviation's early pioneers. On 10 December 1919, Captain [[Ross Macpherson Smith|Ross Smith]] and his crew landed in Darwin and won a £10,000 prize from the Australian government for completing the first flight from London to Australia in under 30 days. Smith and his crew flew a [[Vickers Vimy]], G-EAOU, and landed on an airstrip that has become Ross Smith Avenue.

Other aviation pioneers include [[Amy Johnson]], [[Amelia Earhart]], Sir [[Charles Kingsford Smith]] and [[Bert Hinkler]]. The original QANTAS Empire Airways Ltd Hangar, a registered heritage site,<ref>{{cite web|title=Heritage Register|url=http://www.ntlis.nt.gov.au/heritageregister/f?p=103:302:4229181194015530::NO::P302_SITE_ID:119|publisher=Northern Territory government|access-date=23 June 2016}}</ref> was part of the original Darwin Civil Aerodrome in Parap and is now a museum that still bears scars from the [[bombing of Darwin]] during World War II.<ref>[http://www.enjoy-darwin.com/qantas-australia.html "QANTAS hangar"]. ''Enjoy Darwin''.</ref>

Darwin was home to Australian and U.S. pilots during the war, with airstrips built in and around Darwin. Today Darwin provides a staging ground for [[military exercise]]s.

Darwin was a compulsory stopover and checkpoint in the London-to-Melbourne Centenary Air Race in 1934. The official name of the race was the [[MacRobertson Air Race]]. Winners of the race were [[Tom Campbell Black]] and [[C. W. A. Scott]].

The following is an excerpt from [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]], 29 October 1934:

Biggest sensation of the race came just before dawn on the third day, when burly Lieutenant Scott and dapper [[Flight Lieutenant|Captain]] Black flew their scarlet [[De Havilland DH.88|Comet]] into Darwin. They had covered the last {{convert|300|mi|km|disp=sqbr}} over water on one motor, risked death landing on a field made soggy by the first rain in seven months. Said sandy-haired Lieutenant Scott: "We've had a devil of a trip." But they had flown {{convert|9000|mi|km|comma=off|disp=sqbr}} in two days, had broken the England to Australia record of 162 hr. in the unbelievable time of 52hr. 33 min., were only {{convert|2000|mi|km|comma=off|disp=sqbr}} from their goal at Melbourne.}}

The [[Darwin Aviation Museum]] is about {{convert|8|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the city centre on the Stuart Highway and is one of only three places outside the United States where a B-52 bomber (on permanent loan from the United States Air Force) is on public display.<ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:Darwin Australia.jpg|thumb|A satellite image of Darwin and the surrounding areas.]]
Darwin is a coastal city, situated along the western shoreline of the Northern Territory. The water meets the land from the [[Beagle Gulf]], which extends out into the [[Timor Sea]]. The central business district occupies a low bluff overlooking [[Darwin Harbour]] to the south, beyond which lie [[East Arm, Northern Territory|East Arm]], [[Middle Arm, Northern Territory]], and, across the gulf, West Arm. Middle Arm has an industrial precinct on the peninsula, which is being promoted as a [[sustainable development]] area that will include plants for industries such as low-emission [[petrochemical]]s, [[renewable hydrogen]], and [[Carbon capture and storage|carbon capture storage]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Middle Arm Sustainable Development Precinct | website=Invest NT | date=17 February 2022 | url=https://invest.nt.gov.au/investment-opportunities/middle-arm-sustainable-development-precinct | access-date=4 July 2022}}</ref> The city is flanked by Frances Bay to the east and Cullen Bay to the west.

The rest of the city is relatively flat and low-lying, and areas bordering the coast are home to recreational reserves, extensive beaches, and excellent fishing.

=== City and suburbs ===
{{Main|List of Darwin suburbs}}

[[File:Map of the Wards and Suburbs of Darwin, Northern Territory.png|upright|thumb|Map of Darwin with suburbs]]
Darwin and its suburbs spread in an approximately triangular shape, with the older southwestern suburbs—and the city itself—forming one corner, the newer northern suburbs another, and the eastern suburbs, progressing towards Palmerston, forming the third.

The older part of Darwin is separated from the newer northern suburbs by [[Darwin International Airport]] and [[RAAF Base Darwin]]. [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]] is a [[satellite city]] {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Darwin that was established in the 1980s and is one of Australia's fastest-growing municipalities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palmerston.nt.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=292|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813074102/http://www.palmerston.nt.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=292|archive-date=13 August 2010|title=Palmerston Growth|publisher=Palmerston City Council}}</ref> Darwin's rural areas, including [[Howard Springs, Northern Territory|Howard Springs]], [[Humpty Doo, Northern Territory|Humpty Doo]] and [[Berry Springs, Northern Territory|Berry Springs]], are experiencing strong growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.futuredarwin.nt.gov.au/development/transport.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929035715/http://www.futuredarwin.nt.gov.au/development/transport.html|archive-date=29 September 2008|title=Darwin to Palmerston Transport Corridor|quote=Traffic volumes have continued to increase on all road links between Darwin and Palmerston in parallel with the growth of Palmerston and the rural areas...|access-date=5 February 2008|publisher=[[Government of the Northern Territory]]}}</ref>
[[File:Darwin CBD - IMG 6081.jpg|left|thumb|[[Darwin city centre]]]]
Darwin's [[central business district]] (CBD) is bounded by Daly Street in the northwest, McMinn Street in the northeast, Mitchell Street on the southwest, and Bennett Street on the southeast. The CBD has been the focus of a number of major projects, such as the billion-dollar redevelopment of the Stokes Hill wharf waterfront area, including a convention centre with seating for 1,500 people and approximately {{convert|4000|m2|sqft}} of exhibition space. The developers announced that this includes hotels, residential apartments, and public space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theterritory.com.au/index.php?menuID=148 |title=Major Projects |publisher=Northern Territory Government |access-date=15 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513094922/http://www.theterritory.com.au/index.php?menuID=148 |archive-date=13 May 2008 }}</ref> The city's main industrial areas are along the Stuart Highway toward Palmerston, centred on [[Winnellie, Northern Territory|Winnellie]]. The area'a largest shopping precinct is [[Casuarina Square]].

The most expensive residential areas stand along the coast in suburbs such as the marina of [[Cullen Bay, Northern Territory|Cullen Bay]], [[Larrakeyah, Northern Territory|Larrakeyah]], [[Bayview, Northern Territory|Bayview]] and [[Brinkin, Northern Territory|Brinkin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.id.com.au/darwin/atlas/default.asp?id=146&pg=19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903154759/http://www.id.com.au/darwin/atlas/default.asp?id=146&pg=19|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 September 2006|title=Community Atlas – High Income Households|publisher=Darwin City Council|access-date=4 February 2008}}</ref> These low-lying regions are at risk during cyclones and higher tides, but adequate drainage and stringent building regulations have reduced the potential damage to buildings or injury to residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darcity.nt.gov.au/documents/RapidRiskAssessmentFINAL.pdf|title=The Qualitative Rapid Environmental Risk Assessment|publisher=Darwin City Council|access-date=4 February 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216115715/http://www.darcity.nt.gov.au/documents/RapidRiskAssessmentFINAL.pdf|archive-date=16 February 2008}}</ref> The inner northern suburbs are home to lower-income households, although low-income Territory Housing units are scattered throughout the metropolitan area.<ref>

=== Climate ===
[[File:Darwin thunderstorm.jpg|thumb|A wet-season storm at night in January]]
Darwin has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen ''Aw'']])<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tapper|first1=Andrew|last2=Tapper|first2=Nigel|title=The weather and climate of Australia and New Zealand|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=0-19-553393-3|edition=First|editor=Gray, Kathleen|page=300}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = CHAPTER 7: Introduction to the Atmosphere | work=physicalgeography.net |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/7v.html | access-date =15 July 2008 }}</ref> with distinct wet and dry seasons, and the average maximum temperature is similar year round. The [[Australian Building Codes Board]] classifies it as Climate Zone 1{{efn|The [[National Construction Code|NCC]] Climate zones are a broad classification of climate zones by the NCC ranging from one to eight, categorising the different climates of Australia.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Trombley |first1=Jeremy |last2=Halawa |first2=Edward |title=Can further energy reductions be achieved through behaviour changes in low income households? |journal=Energy Procedia |date=September 2017 |volume=121 |pages=230–237 |doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2017.08.022 |doi-access=free }} p. 231</ref> The dry season runs from about May to September, during which nearly every day is sunny, and afternoon relative humidity averages around 30%.<ref name="DarwinAirportAWS">{{cite web | title = Darwin Airport | publisher=Bureau of Meteorology |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_014015_All.shtml | access-date =25 April 2022}}</ref>

The driest period of the year, seeing about {{convert|5|mm|in|abbr=on}} of monthly rainfall on average, is between May and September. In the coolest months, June and July, the daily minimum temperature may dip as low as {{convert|14|°C|°F}}, but very rarely lower, and a temperature lower than {{convert|10|°C|°F}} has never been recorded in the city centre. Outer suburbs away from the coast occasionally record temperatures as low as {{convert|5|°C|°F}} in the dry season. For a 147‑day period during the 2012 dry season, from 5 May to 29 September, Darwin recorded no precipitation. Prolonged periods of no precipitation are common in the dry season in [[Northern Australia]] (particularly in the [[Northern Territory]] and northern regions of [[Western Australia]]), although a no-rainfall event of this extent is rare. The 3pm dewpoint average in the wet season is around {{convert|24.0|°C|°F}}.<ref name="DarwinAirportAWS"/>

Extreme temperatures at the Darwin Post Office Station have ranged from {{convert|40.4|°C|°F}} on 17 October 1892 to {{convert|13.4|°C|°F}} on 25 June 1891; extreme temperatures at the Darwin Airport station (which is farther from the coast and routinely records cooler temperatures than the post office station, which is in Darwin's CBD) have ranged from {{convert|38.9|°C|°F}} on 18 October 1982 to {{convert|10.4|°C|°F}} on 29 July 1942. The highest minimum temperature on record is {{convert|30.7|°C|°F}} on 18 January 1928 for the post office station and {{convert|29.7|°C|°F}} on both 25 November 1987 and 17 December 2014 for the airport station. The lowest maximum temperature on record is {{convert|18.4|°C|°F}} on 3 June 1904 for the post office station and {{convert|21.1|°C|°F}} on 14 July 1968 for the airport station.<ref name="DarwinAirportAWS"/><ref name="DarwinPO">{{cite web |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_014016_All.shtml| title = Climate statistics for Australian locations|date=8 May 2014}}</ref>

The wet season is associated with [[tropical cyclone]]s and [[Australian monsoon|monsoon]] rains.<ref>{{cite web | title = Information about Darwin | publisher = Charles Darwin University | url = http://www.cdu.edu.au/studyabroad/services.html#climate | access-date = 15 July 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080724032835/http://www.cdu.edu.au/studyabroad/services.html#climate | archive-date = 24 July 2008 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Most rainfall occurs between December and March (the summer), when thunderstorms are common and afternoon relative humidity averages over 70 percent during the wettest months.<ref name="DarwinAirportAWS"/> It does not rain every day during the wet season, but most days have plentiful cloud cover; January averages under six hours of bright sunshine daily. Darwin's highest daily rainfall verified by the Bureau of Meteorology is {{convert|367.6|mm}}, which fell when [[Cyclone Carlos]] bore down on the Darwin area on 16 February 2011.<ref>{{cite web | title = Cyclone Carlos bears down on Darwin | publisher = Weatherzone | url = http://www.weatherzone.com.au/news/cyclone-carlos-bears-down-on-darwin/16392 | access-date = 16 February 2011 | archive-date = 19 February 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110219015325/http://www.weatherzone.com.au/news/cyclone-carlos-bears-down-on-darwin/16392 | url-status = dead }}</ref> February 2011 was also Darwin's wettest month ever recorded, with {{convert|1110.2|mm}} at the airport.<ref name="DarwinAirportAWS"/>

The hottest months are October and November, just before the onset of the main rain season. The temperature is usually below {{convert|35|°C|°F}}, but the [[heat index]] sometimes rises above {{convert|45|°C|°F}}, because of humidity levels that most find uncomfortable. Because of its long dry season, Darwin has the second-highest average daily hours of sunshine (8.4) of any Australian capital, with the most sunshine from April to November; only [[Perth]], Western Australia, averages more (8.8). The sun passes directly overhead in mid-October and mid-February.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.science.org.au/nova/005/005act02.htm|title=Direct solar energy|publisher=Australian Academy of Science|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629223440/http://science.org.au/nova/005/005act02.htm|archive-date=29 June 2012}}</ref>

The average temperature of the sea ranges from {{convert|25.8|C|1}} in July to {{convert|31.5|C|1}} in December.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seatemperature.org/australia-pacific/australia/darwin.htm|title=Darwin Water Temperature – Australia – Sea Temperatures|first=Copyright Global Sea Temperatures-A.-Connect|last=Ltd|website=World Sea Temperatures|access-date=26 January 2019}}</ref>

Darwin occupies one of the most lightning-prone areas in Australia. On 31 January 2002 an early-morning [[squall line]] produced over 5,000 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes within a {{convert|60|km|mi|adj=on}} radius of Darwin alone—about three times the amount of lightning that Perth experiences on average in an entire year.<ref name="GUM"/><ref>

Darwin's population changed after the Second World War. Like many other Australian cities, Darwin experienced influxes from Europe, with significant numbers of [[Italians]] and [[Greeks]] during the 1960s and 1970s. It also began to experience an influx from other European countries, which included the [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Germans]], and many others.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/3105.0.65.0012006?OpenDocument|title=Darwin Significant Migration Groups|author=Australian Bureau of Statistics|access-date=26 March 2008|author-link=Australian Bureau of Statistics}}</ref> A significant proportion of Darwin's residents are recent immigrants from [[Asian Australian|Asia]], including the peoples of [[East Timor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nt.gov.au/community/multicultural-communities/community-profiles/portuguese-timorese|title=Portuguese-Timorese|publisher=Northern Territory Government|date=2 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.localsearch.com.au/profile/portuguese-timorese-social-club-inc/marrara-nt/fOed|title=Portuguese & Timorese Social Club Inc in Marrara|website=Localsearch|access-date=3 September 2019|archive-date=16 November 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221116111107/https://www.localsearch.com.au/profile/portuguese-timorese-social-club-inc/marrara-nt/fOed|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Darwin City Council (incorporated under the Northern Territory Local Government Act 1993) governs the [[City of Darwin]], which takes in the CBD and the suburbs. The city has been governed by a city council form of government since 1957. The council consists of 13 elected members, the [[lord mayor]], and 12 [[Alderman|aldermen]].

The City of Darwin electorate is organised into four electoral units or wards. The wards are Chan, Lyons, Richardson, and Waters. The constituents of each ward are directly responsible for electing three [[Alderman|aldermen]].

The rest of the Darwin area is divided into two [[Local Government Areas of the Northern Territory|local government areas]]—the [[City of Palmerston|Palmerston City Council]] and the [[Coomalie Shire|Shire of Coomalie]]. These areas have elected councils that are responsible for functions delegated to them by the [[Northern Territory Government]], such as planning and garbage collection.

The [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory]] convenes in Darwin in the Northern Territory [[Parliament House, Darwin|Parliament House]]. [[Government House, Darwin|Government House]], the official residence of the [[Administrator of the Northern Territory]], is on the Esplanade.

Darwin is split between nine electoral divisions in the Legislative Assembly—[[electoral division of Port Darwin|Port Darwin]], [[electoral division of Fannie Bay|Fannie Bay]], [[electoral division of Fong Lim|Fong Lim]], [[electoral division of Nightcliff|Nightcliff]], [[electoral division of Sanderson|Sanderson]], [[electoral division of Johnston|Johnston]], [[Electoral division of Casuarina|Casuarina]], [[electoral division of Wanguri|Wanguri]], and [[electoral division of Karama|Karama]].

Also on the Esplanade is the [[Supreme Court of the Northern Territory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.nt.gov.au/|title=The Supreme Court of the Northern Territory|website=supremecourt.nt.gov.au|access-date=26 January 2019}}</ref> Darwin has a Magistrate's Court on the corner of Cavenagh and Bennett streets, close to the Darwin City Council Chambers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://localcourt.nt.gov.au/|title=NT Local Courts|first=NT Local|last=Courts|date=27 January 2019|website=localcourt.nt.gov.au|access-date=26 January 2019}}</ref>

The two largest economic sectors are [[mining]] and [[tourism]].

Darwin's importance as a port is expected to grow, due to the increased exploitation of petroleum in the nearby Timor Sea and to the completion of the railway link and continued expansion in trade with Asia. During 2005, a number of major construction projects started in Darwin. One is the redevelopment of the Wharf Precinct, which includes a large convention and exhibition centre, apartment housing including [[Outrigger Pandanas]] and [[Evolution on Gardiner]], retail and entertainment outlets including a large wave pool and safe swimming lagoon. The [[Chinatown]] project has also started with plans to construct Chinese-themed retail and dining outlets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nt.gov.au/waterfront/news/newsletter/2005/pdf/200504Transformation.pdf |title=Darwin City Waterfront |access-date=13 May 2007 |work=Northern Territory Government |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604233555/http://www.nt.gov.au/waterfront/news/newsletter/2005/pdf/200504Transformation.pdf |archive-date=4 June 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The year is traditionally divided into the wet and dry seasons, but there are up to six traditional seasons in Darwin. It is warm and sunny from May to September. Humidity rises during the green season, from October to April, bringing thunderstorms and monsoonal rains that rejuvenate the landscape. Tourism is largely seasonal, with most tourists visiting during the cooler dry season, from April to September.

== Architecture ==
[[File:Darwin (AU), KPMG -- 2019 -- 4322.jpg|thumb|18 Smith Street; constructed in the late 19th century]]
As Darwin was destroyed by cyclones several times and suffered severe bomb damage during World War II, few historic buildings remain in town. The Administrator's Office dating from 1883 was used as a law court and as a police station and was only slightly damaged by bombs, but in 1974, the cyclone completely destroyed it. In 1979, it was decided to rebuild, and the reconstruction was finished in 1981. The building houses government offices today. Opposite the building, Survivors Lookout offers a view of the marina.<ref>Information board on the building</ref>{{primary source inline|date=May 2020}}[[File:Darwin (AU), Browns Mart Theatre -- 2019 -- 4401-3.jpg|thumb|[[Brown's Mart]]]]In a park in the south of the CBD, the ruin of the Town Hall built in 1883 and destroyed by the cyclone in 1974 can be seen. Browns Mart is a stone building dating from 1880 opposite the park. Browns Mart was originally used in many different activities including commerce, storage, shipping and insurance agency, mining exchange and meetings of local organisations<ref>Rich, Jenny (1988). Brown's Mart, Darwin. Brown's Mart Trustees, Darwin</ref> but it was transformed into a theatre.<ref>Veronika Pavel: ''Australien – Osten und Zentrum'', p. 293. Markgröningen 2011</ref>

One of Darwin's most prominent buildings is the Chinese Temple, which was founded in 1887 and damaged by cyclones in 1897 and in 1937. It was severely damaged by bombs in 1942 and rebuilt after the war. On 24 December 1974 the cyclone completely destroyed it. Reconstruction was completed in 1978.

There are various modern churches in Darwin. St Mary's Star of the Sea Roman Catholic Cathedral was inaugurated in 1962. Christ Church Anglican Cathedral was rebuilt in 1977 after being severely damaged by bombs in 1942 and destroyed by Cyclone Tracy in 1974. The Uniting Memorial Church was built in 1960.

=== Parks and gardens ===
Darwin has extensive parks and gardens. These include the [[George Brown Darwin Botanic Gardens]], [[East Point, Northern Territory|East Point Reserve]], Casuarina Coastal Reserve, [[Charles Darwin National Park]], [[Knuckey Lagoons Conservation Reserve]], Leanyer Recreation Park, the [[Nightcliff, Northern Territory|Nightcliff]] Foreshore, [[Bicentennial Park (Darwin)|Bicentennial Park]] and the Jingili Water Gardens.

=== Wildlife ===
Darwin is a popular bird-watching site, with locations such as the George Brown Darwin Botanic Gardens, East Point Reserve, Buffalo Creek, Leanyer Ponds, and Knuckey Lagoon. Slightly further from the city is one of the best birding sites in the country, [[Fogg Dam Conservation Reserve]].

Some species of native mammals are more abundant in Darwin than in the surrounding native forest and woodland ecosystems of the region,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=von Takach |first1=Brenton |last2=Scheele |first2=Ben C. |last3=Moore |first3=Harry |last4=Murphy |first4=Brett P. |last5=Banks |first5=Sam C. |title=Patterns of niche contraction identify vital refuge areas for declining mammals |journal=Diversity and Distributions |date=November 2020 |volume=26 |issue=11 |pages=1467–1482 |doi=10.1111/ddi.13145 }}</ref> including the [[common brushtail possum]] and [[black-footed tree-rat]]. This is likely due to the presence of well-watered gardens and parks, the absence of frequent fires, and the availability of denning sites (e.g. the roofs of houses).

Darwin is also home to many species of frogs and reptiles. There are more species of snake in Darwin than any other Australian capital city, with 34 non-marine snake species found in the region, of which 23 have been recorded by professional snake catchers in Darwin itself.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Parkin |first1=Tom |last2=Jolly |first2=Chris J. |last3=de Laive |first3=Alana |last4=von Takach |first4=Brenton |title=Snakes on an urban plain: Temporal patterns of snake activity and human–snake conflict in Darwin, Australia |journal=Austral Ecology |date=May 2021 |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=449–462 |doi=10.1111/aec.12990 }}</ref> Fortunately for the citizens of Darwin, a far smaller proportion of these snakes are highly venomous than is typically found in other cities, due to the low numbers of front-fanged elapid species and dominance of relatively harmless pythons and colubrid species.

The speedway has hosted a number of Australian Championships over the years for different categories including [[Australian Sprintcar Championship|Sprintcars]], [[Australian Speedcar Championship|Speedcars]], and [[Australian Super Sedan Championship|Super Sedans]].

The Darwin Cup culminating on the first Monday of August is a popular horse race event for Darwin and draws large crowds every year to Fannie Bay Racecourse. While it is not as popular as the [[Melbourne Cup]], it does draw a crowd and, in 2003, [[Sky Racing]] began televising most of the races. The Darwin Cup day is a public holiday for the Northern Territory ([[Picnic Day (Australian holiday)|Picnic Day]] public holiday).

There is one [[Greyhound racing in Australia|greyhound racing]] track in Darwin at Winnellie Park on Hook Road.
