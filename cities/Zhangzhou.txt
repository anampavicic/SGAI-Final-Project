'''Zhangzhou''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|æ|ŋ|ˈ|dʒ|oʊ}}) is a [[prefecture-level city]] in [[Fujian]] [[provinces of China|Province]], China. The prefecture around the city proper comprises the southeast corner of the province, facing the [[Taiwan Strait]] and (with [[Quanzhou]]) surrounding the prefecture of [[Xiamen]].

=={{anchor|Names|Etymology}}Name==
Zhangzhou is the [[Chinese tones|atonal]] [[pinyin]] [[romanization of Chinese|romanization]] of the city's [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name {{lang|zh|{{linktext|漳州}}}}, using its pronunciation in [[Standard Mandarin]].<ref>[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/zhangzhou "Zhangzhou"]. ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.</ref> The name derives from the city's former status as the seat of the [[imperial China|imperial Chinese]] [[Zhang Prefecture]]. The same name was romanized as '''Changchow''' on the [[Chinese Postal Map]] and {{nowrap|'''Chang-chou'''}} in [[Wade-Giles]]. Other romanizations include Chang-chow.<ref name=Chang-chow>{{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Chang-chow |volume=5 |page=391}}</ref>

==Geography==
Zhangzhou proper lies on the [[Bank (geography)|banks]] of the [[Jiulong River]] in southern [[Fujian]] about {{convert|35|mi}} from central Xiamen,<ref name=Chang-chow/> whose urban core has grown to form a single urbanized area with it. The prefecture of Zhangzhou comprises the southeastern corner of the province, surrounding [[Xiamen]]. The prefecture of [[Quanzhou]] lies to its northeast, [[Longyan]] to its northwest, and [[Shantou]] in [[Guangdong]] to its southwest.

===Climate===
Zhangzhou has a [[monsoon]]-influenced [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), with mild to warm winters and long, very hot and humid summers. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from {{convert|13.2|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|28.8|°C|1}} in July, and the annual mean is {{convert|21.3|°C|1}}. The frost-free period lasts 330 days.

==History==
[[File:闽南护法区.png|thumb|Map of the [[Constitution Protection Region of Southern Fujian]]]]
According to [[Odoric of Pordenone]], Zhangzhou was a prosperous city twice the size of [[Bologna]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Yule|first=Henry|title=The Travels of Friar Odoric|year=2002|page=123}}</ref>

During the early [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], Zhangzhou was the primary [[Fujian]]ese port trading with [[Portuguese Macao]] and [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] [[Colonial Manila|Manila]]. For a time, the Portuguese maintained a [[trading factory|factory]] in the city.<ref name=quanzhou/>

During the late [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], Zhangzhou remained a center of [[Chinese silk|silk]], [[brick]], and [[sugar in China|sugar]] production with about a million people and extensive internal and maritime trade. Its [[Chinese city walls|city wall]] had a circumference of about {{convert|4.5|mi|sp=us}} but included a good deal of open ground and farmland. Its streets were paved with [[granite]] but badly maintained. The {{convert|800|ft|sp=us|adj=on}} bridge across the [[Jiulong River]] consisted of wooden planks laid between 25 piles of stones at roughly equal intervals.<ref name=Chang-chow/> The port of [[Xiamen]] in [[Xiamen Island|an island]] at the mouth of the Jiulong principally functioned as a trading center for the produce and wares of Zhangzhou and its hinterland;<ref name=amoy/> both suffered economically when Indian tea plantations cratered demand for Fujianese tea in the late 19th century.<ref>{{cite EB1911 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Amoy |ref={{harvid|''EB''|1911}} |volume=1 |page=878 }}.</ref>

From 1918 to 1920, [[Chen Jiongming]] established the [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Constitution Protection Region of Southern Fujian]] with Zhangzhou as its capital.<ref>[https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/leslie-h-chen-chen-jiongming Chen Jiongming Anarchism and the Federalist State]</ref>

The old city of Zhangzhou (now [[Xiangcheng District, Zhangzhou|Xiangcheng District]]) was occupied in April and May 1932 by a column of [[Chinese Soviet Republic|Communist guerrillas]] under [[Mao Zedong]]. Due to the presence of Western [[gunboat]]s in [[Xiamen Bay]], arms shipments from the [[Soviet Union]] were unable to get up the [[Jiulong River]] to Mao's forces and the main Communist bases. Discovering this, Mao retreated from the city, according to some accounts with a substantial amount of loot taken from its residents.<ref>{{citation |last=Zhang |first=Rong |author-mask=Zhang Rong |author2=Jung Chang |display-authors=1 |title=[[Mao: The Unknown Story]] |date=2005 |page=117 }}.</ref>

==Administrative divisions==
Zhangzhou comprises 4 [[district of China|urban districts]], and 7 [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Zhangzhou Government |first1= |title=Approaching Zhangzhou |url=http://www.zhangzhou.gov.cn/cms/html/zzsrmzf/zjzz/index.html | publisher=Zhangzhou Government}}</ref>
