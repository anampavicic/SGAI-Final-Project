Seremban was founded as '''Sungei Ujong''' (or '''Sungai Ujong'''). While the town was renamed Seremban thereafter, the name Sungai Ujong most prominently persists as a street name for a road adjoining the southern side of town (Sungai Ujong Road, or ''Jalan Sungai Ujong''). It is also the name of a ''[[Negeri Sembilan#Geography and climate|luak]]'' (chiefdom) that formed [[Negeri Sembilan]], that covers the [[Seremban District|eponymous district]] as well as neighbouring [[Port Dickson District]].

Among the [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese-speaking community]], the city is known as "''fùhyùhng''" in Cantonese and "''fúróng''" in Mandarin ({{zh|t=芙蓉}}, literally "[[hibiscus rosa-sinensis|hibiscus]]"), which comes from a phonetic approximation of "Ujong" (using the Cantonese reading of the characters).

== History ==

[[File:Mural at Seremban Art Alley.jpg|thumb|A [[mural]] in the ''Lorong Seni'' (Art Alley), reflecting the city's [[tin]] mining origins.]]

'''Sungai Ujong''', also known as '''Sening Ujong''', as it was originally known, was an ancient settlement. It has been said in the [[Malay Annals]] that [[Parameswara (king)|King Parameswara]] reportedly visited Sening Ujong after fleeing the kingdom of [[Kingdom of Singapura|Singapura]] before ultimately establishing the [[Malacca Sultanate]]. The same settlement was also referred as '''Sang Hyang Ujong''' in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] accounts, notably the ''[[Nagarakretagama]]'', as well as '''Suneujon''' in [[Godinho de Erédia]]'s cartographic records, which dates back to 1613.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Winstedt |first=R.O. |author-link=Richard Olaf Winstedt |title=Negri Sembilan: The History, Polity and Beliefs of the Nine States |date=1933 |publisher=Royal Asiatic Society |journal=Journal of the Malayan Branc |page=42 |edition=JMBRAS v.11 |url=https://archive.org/details/dli.ernet.240629/page/42/mode/2up}}</ref> Growth took off, as with most major towns in [[Peninsular Malaysia]], after the discovery of [[tin ore]] in the 1870s. The discovery of tin in a nearby area called [[Rasah]] saw an influx of [[Arab]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and Chinese immigrants to work on the [[mining|mines]] and trade there. Most of the local Malays were farmers.

[[File:KITLV - 79932 - Kleingrothe, C.J. - Medan - Seremban - circa 1910.tif|250px|thumb|Seremban, Negeri Sembilan, [[Federated Malay States]], circa 1910]]

[[File:SEREMBAN.png|thumb|Map of Seremban in 1951]]

Renamed as Seremban, the town flourished not only as a mining area but also a business centre. The [[Linggi River]] served as the sole outlet to ferry [[tin]] and supplies in and out of the town. Revenue came not only from tin trade but also from the large amount of taxes collected, much to the displeasure of the traders and the [[British colonial]]ists at the neighbouring port of [[Malacca]].

The local chieftains, namely the Dato' Kelana and the Dato' Shahbandar of Sungai Ujong were at odds with each other on the rights to collect taxes and ownership and control of the mines. The rivalry to assert influence and authority opened the door for British intervention in Negeri Sembilan. The British sided with the Dato' Kelana upon invitation and defeated the Dato' Bandar forces who was later sent into exile to Singapore. In a show of gratitude to the British for helping him win the war, the Dato' Kelana had no choice but to accept a British Resident whose job was to advise him on matters other than religion and [[Malay customs]].

Captain Murray was appointed the first resident and later set-up his residence at Channer Road, now renamed Jalan Dato' Siamang Gagap. Soon after, the people living around Rasah moved to Channer Road for the sake of security and its orderly administration.<ref name="Administration in Seremban">{{cite web |url=http://www.mpsns.gov.my/mps_v2/BI/profile_history.htm |title=Administration in Seremban |work=[[Majlis Perbandaran Seremban]] |access-date=14 February 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080108022157/http://www.mpsns.gov.my/mps_v2/BI/profile_history.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 8 January 2008}}</ref>

===City status===
Before 2020, Seremban was one of four state capitals that had yet to be elevated to city status ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Bandar raya''); the other three being [[Kota Bharu]] ([[Kelantan]]), [[Kuantan]] ([[Pahang]]) and [[Kangar]] ([[Perlis]]). To achieve city status, the state government had agreed to merge the Nilai Municipal Council and Seremban Municipal Council, with that decision being approved by the [[Government of Malaysia|federal government]] in 2012.<ref name="City status for Seremban">{{cite web |url=http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2008&dt=0228&pub=Utusan_Malaysia&sec=Dalam_Negeri&pg=dn_06.htm |title=City status for Seremban |work=[[Utusan Malaysia]] |access-date=14 February 2008 }}</ref>

Then Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan said during Tuanku Mukhriz's birthday{{cquote|The state government wanted to ensure all the necessary infrastructure, public transport and amenities and services which include garbage collection and safer neighbourhoods, were in place before it did so.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/1/14/nation/7784138&sec=nation|title=Seremban on the right track|work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|date=14 January 2011|access-date=24 February 2011}}</ref>}}

On 13 December 2017, then [[Chief Ministers in Malaysia|Menteri Besar]] of [[Negeri Sembilan]], [[Mohamad Hasan (politician)|Mohamad Hasan]] stated that Seremban achieve city status in 2018.<ref name="nst.com.my">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2017/12/314130/seremban-get-city-status-2018-mb|title=Seremban to get city status in 2018 - MB &#124; New Straits Times|date=13 December 2017|website=NST Online}}</ref> In order to get city status, both Seremban and Nilai Municipal Councils would be merged to form a new local authority, Seremban City Council.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bharian.com.my/berita/wilayah/2017/12/362934/seremban-jadi-bandar-raya-2018|title=Seremban jadi bandar raya 2018|first=Tuty Haryanti Ahmad|last=Rodzi|date=13 December 2017|website=Berita Harian}}</ref> However, he said, the merging of the two entities would not involve reducing staff or higher assessment rates in the Seremban area, as increasing rates was not a prerequisite for attaining city status. 
{{Cquote
| quote = So, I hereby announce that the assessment rates in Negeri Sembilan for 2018 will not be raised<ref name="nst.com.my"/>
}}

In February 2018, a further announcement was made regarding the formation of Seremban City Hall (''Dewan Bandaraya Seremban''), which was poised to be completed in April. However, the official declaration of Seremban as a city would only occur in January 2019, in conjunction with the birthday of the state's ruler Tuanku Muhriz (January 14).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/02/28/negri-mb-seremban-and-nilai-councils-to-be-merged-in-april/|title=Negri MB: Seremban and Nilai councils to be merged in April &#124; The Star|website=www.thestar.com.my}}</ref> After the change in the ruling coalition after the 14th General Election ushered in a new state government, the new Mentri Besar Aminuddin Harun announced his decision to push back the official promotion towards the end of the year, citing the inability of contractors to complete refurbishment works at the new City Hall in time. However, the postponement would allow the authorities time to iron out any flaws in Seremban's infrastructure and amenities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/09/05/mb-serembans-city-status-deferred-to-end-2019//|title=MB: Seremban's city status deferred to end 2019 &#124; The Star|website=www.thestar.com.my}}</ref>

Two municipal administrators, Seremban Municipal Council (''Majlis Perbandaran Seremban'') and Nilai Municipal Council (''Majlis Perbandaran Nilai'') officially merged into a new administrator, [[Seremban City Council]] (''Majlis Bandaraya Seremban'') on 1 January 2020. On 20 January, Seremban's status as a city was officialised in a declaration ceremony.<ref name="BeritaHarian" />

Seremban is situated about 60 kilometres south of [[Kuala Lumpur]], the capital city of [[Malaysia]], 50 kilometres south of the administrative capital [[Putrajaya]], and about 30&nbsp;kilometres inland from the coast. Part of the [[Malaysia Vision Valley]] corridor and the National Growth Conurbation, Seremban is considered to be the southern limit of the [[Greater Kuala Lumpur]] metropolitan area.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://techvalley.com.my/vision.html | title=Sendayan TechValley }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://planmalaysia.perak.gov.my/index.php/pengumuman/2137-kawasan-pertumbuhan-utama-pemangkin-pembangunan-negara | title=Kawasan Pertumbuhan Utama Pemangkin Pembangunan Negara }}</ref> It is located in the [[Linggi River]] valley, at the western fringes of the [[Titiwangsa Mountains]]. The terrain is generally hilly, and the soil is mostly reddish [[laterite]] soil, suitable for the cultivation of rubber and [[palm oil]], thus making Seremban the agricultural centre for the state. Since the establishment of Seremban, the Linggi River has played an important role in the city's growth. During the boom period of [[tin]] mining, the Linggi River served as the major transportation route for tin traders. Today, it is one of the major sources of water for the Seremban metropolitan area and Negeri Sembilan.

The climate of Seremban, like most parts of [[Peninsular Malaysia]], is generally hot and humid (tropical) with a mean temperature of about 26–30&nbsp;degrees Celsius. Most of the rainfall is experienced during the inter-[[monsoon]] periods of April and October. The weather remains generally dry for the rest of the year with occasional showers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

==Transportation==
{{Main|Transportation in Seremban}}

===Rail and air===
The rail connection was first constructed in the late 1890s as a stop on the [[Kuala Lumpur]]–[[Singapore]] main line, and until today, the [[Seremban railway station]] (code: {{KLRT code|KB|13}}) still serves as one of the major stops along the line. The station also serves as the southern terminal of the [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu]] electrified commuter network, [[KTM Komuter]], which links the city to [[Kuala Lumpur]] and the Klang Valley on [[Seremban Line]].<ref name="Commuter service in Seremban">{{cite web |url=http://www.ktmb.com.my/article.asp?id=1633 |title=Commuter service in Seremban |work=[[Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad]] |access-date=14 February 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011003756/http://www.ktmb.com.my/article.asp?id=1633 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 11 October 2007}}</ref> From October 2015 to November 2016, the Komuter service has been extended to [[Gemas railway station|Gemas]], though passengers used to be required to alight at Seremban and switch trains to the Gemas extension line (much akin to the [[Tanjung Malim]]–Rawang stretch). However, after 2016, all KTM Komuter trains run to [[Sungai Gadut Komuter station|Sungai Gadut]] or [[Pulau Sebang/Tampin railway station|Pulau Sebang-Tampin]] without requiring to alight at Seremban.

Negeri Sembilan is one of the two states in Malaysia that are not accessible via air transportation ([[Perlis]] being the other state). However, the [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]] (KLIA) is less than a 30&nbsp;minutes drive from Seremban, essentially making the airport closer to Seremban rather than Kuala Lumpur.

===Road===
[[File:Jalan Dato Lee Fong Yee Seremban (220709).jpg|thumb|One of the many intersections in downtown Seremban.]]
[[Malaysia Federal Route 1|Federal Route 1]] is the oldest roadway that connects the towns and cities of the West Coast of [[Peninsular Malaysia]] running through Seremban. It connects Seremban with [[Rembau District|Rembau]] and [[Tampin]] to the south and [[Kajang]], Selangor to the north. Seremban provides access to  [[Kuala Klawang]] through [[Malaysia Federal Route 86|Federal Route 86]], [[Kuala Pilah]] to the east through [[Malaysia Federal Route 51|Federal Route 51]] and the coastal town of [[Port Dickson]] through [[Malaysia Federal Route 53|Federal Route 53]] or [[Seremban–Port Dickson Highway|SPDH]] to the west. The [[North–South Expressway Southern Route|North–South Expressway]] serves Seremban at 4 exits (Exit 217 at Bandar Ainsdale, Exit 218 at Seremban, Exit 219 at Seremban-Port Dickson and Exit 220 at [[Senawang]]). The [[Kajang–Seremban Highway|LEKAS Highway]] links Kajang in Selangor to [[Paroi]] on the eastern end of Seremban. The [[Jalan Labu]] [[Malaysia Federal Route 362|Federal Route 362]] connects Seremban to [[Labu, Negeri Sembilan|Labu]] and [[Nilai]] and [[Jalan Sungai Ujong]] [[Malaysia Federal Route 241|Federal Route 241]] serves Seremban 2 and [[Bandar Sri Sendayan]].
