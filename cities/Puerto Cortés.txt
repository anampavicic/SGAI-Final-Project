'''Puerto Cortés''', originally known as '''Puerto de Caballos''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cedturh.iht.hn/docs/HISTORIA%20DE%20PUERTO%20CORT%C3%89S.pdf|title=Historia de Puerto Cortés|website=Cedturh.iht.hn|access-date=4 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035008/http://cedturh.iht.hn/docs/HISTORIA%20DE%20PUERTO%20CORT%C3%89S.pdf|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> is a port city and municipality on the north [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of [[Honduras]], right on the [[Laguna de Alvarado (Honduras)|Laguna de Alvarado]], north of [[San Pedro Sula]] and east of [[Omoa]], with a natural bay. The present city was founded in the early colonial period.  It grew rapidly in the twentieth century, thanks to the then railroad, and [[Banana production in Honduras|banana production]]. In terms of volume of traffic the [[seaport]] is the largest in Central America and the 36th largest in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enp.hn/web/puerto-cortes.html|title=- Empresa Nacional Portuaria|last=ENP|website=Enp.hn|access-date=4 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120114043/http://www.enp.hn/web/puerto-cortes.html|archive-date=20 November 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The city of Puerto Cortés has a population of 73,150 (2023 calculation).<ref>[https://www.citypopulation.de/en/honduras/cities/ Citypopulation.de] Population of cities in Honduras</ref>

==History==
[[File:Gil Gonzalez Davila.JPG|thumb|left|160px|Drawing of Gil González Dávila]]
[[Gil González Dávila]] founded the city in 1524 and called '''Villa de la Natividad de Nuestra Señora''', now known as Cieneguita. In 1526 [[Hernán Cortés]] came to punish González Dávila and when he arrived on Honduras' coast from [[Mexico]] and started unloading horses and cargo from the ships, several horses were drowned, and for that reason, Cortés called it '''Puerto Caballos'''. By 1533, a local native leader, called Çiçumba (or Çoçumba, or Socremba, or Joamba – the Spanish recorded many variants of his name) had destroyed the town, reportedly taking a woman from Seville, Spain captive.  After Çiçumba's defeat in 1536 by [[Pedro de Alvarado]], a new town, Puerto de Caballos was founded on the southern shore of the body of water known as the Laguna de Alvarado.

The English attacked Puerto Caballos as they did other places along the Honduran coast. [[Christopher Newport]] briefly occupied the town in the [[Battle of Puerto Caballos (1603)|Battle of Puerto Caballos]], part of the [[Anglo–Spanish War (1585)|Anglo–Spanish War]].<ref>David Marley, ''Wars of the Americas:  A Chronology of armed conflict in the Western Hemisphere, 1492 to the present'' (ABC Clio, 2008) 1: 126.</ref> Because it was vulnerable to pirates until the building of the Spanish fort at [[Omoa]] in the 18th century, it had few permanent residents in the 16th and 17th centuries.  People preferred to come out to the coast from San Pedro when a ship came into port.  In 1869 Puerto Caballos changed its name to Puerto Cortés in honour of [[Hernán Cortés]].

===Bananas, railroads and development in the twentieth century===
[[File:Laguna-de-Alvarado.JPG|thumb|220px|Laguna de Alvarado]]
The proposal to construct an "inter-oceanic railway" (''Ferrocarril Interoceánico'') in 1850, a product of the demand for transport from the Atlantic to the Pacific caused by the United States [[Gold Rush of 1849]], began with the anchoring of the railroad at Puerto Cortés. The rail line construction had many problems.<ref>''Relación histórica de los contratiempos que ha sufrido la construcción de un ferrocarril á través de la República de Honduras'' (London: Clayton and Temple, 1875)</ref> In 1876 President [[Marco Aurelio Soto]] nationalised the Trans-Oceanic Railroad, which only reached to [[San Pedro Sula]]. When the [[Panama Canal]] was completed in 1903, the alternative plan to connect the coasts was abandoned. The region became an early centre for [[banana production in Honduras]] through cultivation and export, and the port was a leader in the export of bananas.

The early banana export industry came to be dominated by foreigners; among the first foreigners to obtain a government concession was William Frederick Streich of Philadelphia in 1902.  His concession was in the vicinity of [[Omoa]] and both banks of the Cuyamel River.  However, in 1910 [[Samuel Zemurray]]'s [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]] purchased these 5,000 acres, but soon branched out, both with more land and with political and tax concessions, especially after Zemurray installed [[Manuel Bonilla]] in office as president using mercenaries hired in the area and abroad.  In addition to awarding Cuyamel additional land, Bonilla also waived the company's tax obligations. Cuyamel had built port facilities at Omoa, but also began using the facilities at Puerto Cortés and soon came to dominate them to the point that local shippers had to ask Cuyamel's permission to use the port.<ref>Glen Chambers, Race, Nation and West Indian Immigration to Honduras, 1890–1940 (Baton Rouge:  Louisiana State University Press, 2010) pp. 28–30.  Chambers cites Honduran historian Manuel Argueto, ''Bananas y politica:  Samuel Zemurray y la Cuyamel Fruit Company en Honduras'' (Tegulcigalpa, 1989)</ref> In 1918, Cuyamel constructed a railroad spur into Puerto Cortés, and in 1920 he obtained effective control over the National Railroad, and from this and a network of clandestine railroads the company effectively controlled all transport to the port.<ref>Vilma Laínez and Víctor Meza, "El enclave en la historia de Honduras", ''Anuario de Estudos Centroamericanos'' 1 (1974)</ref>  When Zemurray sold Cuyamel Fruit to [[United Fruit Company|United Fruit]] in 1929, the giant company had great influence in Puerto Cortés and in Honduras as a whole.

==The city==
[[Image:Puertocortes01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|El Malecón]]
During two weeks in August, Puerto Cortés celebrates its local patronal festivities. The last day (a Saturday) is known as '''Noche Veneciana''' ('Venice Night'). 15 August is a local holiday in honor of the '''Virgen de la Asunción''' (Puerto Cortés's local patroness saint).

In September 2001, the '''Laguna de Alvarado''' Bridge was rebuilt and inaugurated after the old bridge, a 50-year-old structure, was badly damaged by [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998. A concrete wall that surrounds and protects a portion of the coastline in the bay area was built near the northern end of the bridge. This wall is known as '''El Malecón''' (Spanish for 'The Breakwater').

The first four-lane highway in Honduras was inaugurated in 1996, connecting Puerto Cortés and the city of [[San Pedro Sula]].

==Seaport==
In 1966, the [[Empresa Nacional Portuaria (Honduras)|Empresa Nacional Portuaria]] (Honduras National Port Authority)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enp.hn|title=- Empresa Nacional Portuaria|last=ENP|website=Enp.hn|access-date=4 October 2017}}</ref> was created. A free trade zone was created in 1976.

Among all worldwide seaports that export containers with goods with destination to USA, Puerto Cortés is the 36th in terms of volume.

Because of its proximity to US seaports in the Gulf of Mexico and on the East Coast and its seaport infrastructure, Puerto Cortés was included in the US [[Container Security Initiative]] (CSI), the first such port in Central America.  In December 2005, the US government signed an agreement with Honduras's government and opened a US Customs Office in Puerto Cortés.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/trade/cargo_security/csi/ports_in_csi.xml |title=Ports in CSI - CBP.gov |access-date=2008-12-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514210622/http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/trade/cargo_security/csi/ports_in_csi.xml |archive-date=14 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Under this agreement, all containers exported from Puerto Cortés that are destined for any US seaport are checked by US Customs officials in Honduras.

In March 2007, under the Megaport initiative, three RPMs (Radiation Portal Monitors) were already installed in Puerto Cortés by [[United States Department of Energy|US DOE]] to inspect all containers with destination to USA, checking for possible dangerous [[radioactive]] threats. On 2 April 2007 the RPMs became operative.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/pr_1176319613900.shtm |title=DHS: Radiation Detection Testing Underway at Two Foreign Sea Ports |access-date=2016-07-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205050252/http://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/pr_1176319613900.shtm |archive-date=5 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
