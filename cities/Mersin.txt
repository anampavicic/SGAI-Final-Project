'''Mersin''' ({{IPA|tr|ˈmæɾsin|pron}}) is a large city and port on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast of [[Mediterranean Region, Turkey|southern]] [[Turkey]]. It is the provincial capital of the [[Mersin Province]] (formerly İçel). It is made up of four district governorates, each having its own municipality: [[Akdeniz, Mersin|Akdeniz]], [[Mezitli]], [[Toroslar]] and [[Yenişehir, Mersin|Yenişehir]].

Mersin lies on the western side of [[Çukurova]], a geographical, economic and cultural region of Turkey. It is an important hub for Turkey's economy, with [[Port of Mersin|Turkey's largest seaport]] located here. The city hosted the [[2013 Mediterranean Games]].

As urbanisation continues eastward, a larger metropolitan region combining Mersin with [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] and [[Adana]] (the Adana-Mersin Metropolitan Area) is in the making with more than 3.3 million inhabitants.

[[Çukurova International Airport]] (COV), 74 kilometres (46mi) from Mersin city center, is the nearest international airport. There are ferry services from Mersin to [[Famagusta]] (Mağusa) in [[Northern Cyprus]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=SysAdmin |title=Akgünler Denizcilik {{!}} Kıbrıs Gemi Biletleri {{!}} Online Bilet Al |url=https://www.akgunlerdenizcilik.com/ |access-date=2022-11-26 |website=Akgünler Denizcilik {{!}} Kıbrıs Feribot-Kıbrıs Gemi Bileti |language=tr-TR}}</ref> Mersin is linked to Adana via Tarsus by way of [[TCDD Taşımacılık|TCDD]] trains.

== Etymology ==
The city was named after the aromatic plant genus ''[[Myrsine]]'' ({{langx|tr|Mersin}}, {{langx|el|Μυρσίνη}}) in the family [[Primulaceae]], a [[Myrtaceae|myrtle]] that grows in abundance in the area. The 17th-century Ottoman traveler [[Evliya Çelebi]] also recorded in his ''[[Seyahatnâme]]'' that there was a clan named the Mersinoğulları (Sons of Mersin) living in the area.<ref>''İçel: Mersin- Tarsus- Çamlıyayla- Erdemli- Silifke- Aydıncık- Bozyazı- Anamur- Gülnar- Mut'' (Kültür, Turizm ve Tanıtım yayınları, 1992), p. 7.</ref> In the 19th century Mersin was also referred to as Mersina.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===
This coast has been inhabited since the [[9th millennium BC]]. Excavations by [[John Garstang]] of the hill of [[Yumuktepe]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=YUMUKTEPE HÖYÜĞÜ Toroslar Belediyesi |url=https://toroslar-bld.gov.tr/mekan/128 |access-date=2022-11-26 |website=Toroslar Belediyesi}}</ref> have revealed 23 levels of occupation, the earliest dating from ca. 6300 BC. Fortifications were put up around 4500 BC, but the site appears to have been abandoned between 350 BC and 300 BC.

=== Classical era ===

Over the centuries, the city was ruled by many states and civilisations including the [[Hittites]], [[ancient Assyrians|Assyrians]], [[Urartians]], [[Persians]], [[Greeks]], [[Armenians]], [[Seleucid]]s and [[Lagids]]. During the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] period, the city bore the name '''Zephyrion''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Ζεφύριον<ref>http://www.jannis.tu-berlin.de/City_&_Ruler_Names.html {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20070614093439/http://www.jannis.tu-berlin.de/City_&_Ruler_Names.html |date=2007-06-14 }} retrieved June 14, 2007</ref>) and was mentioned by numerous ancient authors. Apart from its natural harbour and strategic position along the trade routes of southern [[Anatolia]], the city profited from trade in [[molybdenum]] (white lead) from the neighbouring mines of [[Coreyra]]. Ancient sources attributed the best molybdenum to the city, which also minted its own coins.{{cn|date=January 2024}}
[[File:Mersin_Archaeological_Museum,_2.jpg|thumb|Hellenistic sculpture in [[Mersin Archaeological Museum]]|left]]

The area later became a part of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Cilicia]], which had its capital at [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]], while nearby Mersin was the major port.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=Corycus and Ayas were the two ports of Cilicia. Zephyrion was a fishing village.}} The city, whose name was [[Latin language|Latinised]] to '''Zephyrium''', was renamed as '''Hadrianopolis''' in honour of the Roman emperor [[Hadrian]].{{cn|date=January 2024}} After the death of the emperor [[Theodosius I]] in 395 and the subsequent permanent division of the Roman Empire, Mersin fell into what became the [[Byzantine Empire]].{{cn|date=January 2024}}

The city was an [[episcopal see]] under the [[Patriarchate of Antioch]]. [[Le Quien]] names four bishops of Zephyrium:<ref name="Le Quien">{{Oriens Christianus|volume=2|article=Ecclesia Zephyrii|at=cols. 883–884}}</ref> Aerius, present at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381; Zenobius, a [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]], the writer of a letter protesting the removal of Bishop Meletius of [[Mopsuestia]] by Patriarch [[John I of Antioch|John of Antioch]] (429–441); Hypatius, present at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451; and Peter, present at the [[Council in Trullo]] in 692. The bishopric is included in the [[Catholic Church]]'s list of [[titular see]]s, but since the [[Second Vatican Council]] no new [[titular bishop]] of this Eastern see has been appointed.<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 1012</ref>

=== Medieval period ===
Cilicia was conquered by the [[Arabs]] in the early 7th century, by which time it appears Mersin was a deserted site. The Arabs were followed by the Egyptian [[Tulunids]], then by the [[Byzantine]]s between 965 and c.1080 and then by the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]]. Under [[Armenian Cilicia]], the region of Mersin served as the powerbase for the [[House of Lampron]]. From 1362 to 1513 the region was captured and governed by the [[Ramadanid Emirate]], first as a protectorate of the [[Mamluk Sultanate]], then as an independent state for roughly a century and then as a protectorate of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1513 until 1518 when it was annexed into the [[Ottoman Empire]] and turned into an imperial province.{{cn|date=January 2024}}

{{Expand section|the city's history between 16th and 19th century|date=November 2020}}During the [[American Civil War]], the region became a major supplier of [[cotton]] to make up for the high demand due to shortage. Railroads were extended to Mersin in 1866 from where cotton was exported by sea, and the city developed into a major trade centre.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mersin (İçel) |url=http://www.cometoturkey.com/mersin.html |access-date=2024-01-22 |website=www.cometoturkey.com}}</ref>
In 1909, Mersin's port hosted 645 [[steamship]]s and 797,433 tons of goods. Before [[World War I]], Mersin exported mainly [[sesame seed]]s, cotton, [[cottonseed]], cakes and cereals, and livestock. Cotton was exported to Europe, grain to Turkey and livestock to [[Egypt]]. Coal was the main import into Mersin at this time. [[Messageries Maritimes]] was the largest shipping line to use the port at Mersin.<ref name=Prothero82>{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Anatolia|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11766/view/1/82/}}</ref>

In 1918, the [[Ottoman Empire]] collapsed and Mersin was occupied by French and British troops in accordance with the [[Treaty of Sèvres]]. It was recovered by the [[Turkish Army]] in 1921 at the end of the [[Franco-Turkish War]]. In 1924, Mersin was made a province, and in 1933 Mersin and İçel provinces were merged to form the (greater Mersin) İçel Province. The capital of the province was Mersin. In 2002 the name of the province was changed to Mersin Province.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mersin.gov.tr/tarih#:~:text=1924%20y%C4%B1l%C4%B1nda%20Mersin%20Ad%C4%B1yla%20Vilayet,in%20ismi%20yeniden%20Mersin%20olmu%C5%9Ftur. |title = Tarih}}</ref>

As of 1920, Mersin had five piers at its port, with one privately owned by a railroad company serving Mersin, [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]], and [[Adana]].<ref name="Prothero81">{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Anatolia|year=1920|publisher=H.M.

=== Modern Mersin ===
[[File:MERSİN-20.png|thumb|left|Limonluk neighbourhood]]
Today, Mersin is a large city spreading out along the coast. It has the longest seashore in Turkey as well as in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]].{{citation needed|date=April 2024}}

The Metropolitan Municipality has rescued long stretches of the seafront with walkways, parks and statues, and there are still palm trees on the roadsides.

Since the start of the [[Syrian civil war|Syrian War in 2011]] Mersin has acquired a large population of Syrian refugees.

On 6 February 2023 Mersin was shaken by the twin [[2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake|Turkish-Syrian earthquakes]]. Citizens made homeless in cities further to the east also flocked to Mersin in search of shelter.

== Local Attractions ==
There are six museums within the Mersin urban area; [[Mersin Archaeological Museum]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mersin Museum {{!}} Turkish Museums |url=https://turkishmuseums.com/museum/detail/2152-mersin-museum/2152/4 |access-date=2022-11-26 |website=Turkish Museum |language=en}}</ref> [[Mersin Atatürk Museum]], [[Mersin Naval Museum]], [[Mersin State Art and Sculpture Museum]], [[Mersin Urban History Museum]], [[Mersin Water Museum]].

In the western suburb of Viranşehir (Ruined City) the remains of the ancient city of [[Soli (Cilicia)|Soli/Pompeiiopolis]] stand close to the sea. Only two colonnades dating from the 2nd or 3rd century are obvious although the outline of the agora and of a mole from the harbour can just about be made out.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Freely |first=John |title=The Eastern Mediterranean Coast of Turkey |publisher=SEV Matbaacılık ve Yayıncılık |year=1998 |isbn=978-975-8176-22-9 |edition=1st |location=Istanbul |pages=215–20 |language=English}}</ref>

The city has a total of three modern shopping malls, from which the Forum Mersin is the largest one. [[Mersin Marina]] can also be considered a shopping center with over 40 shops, apart from its main function as a [[marina]]. In the old city center you will find further shopping opportunities and bazaar-like shopping areas.

}}}}Unlike the mountainous rugged terrain of the whole province Mersin is located at the western edge of the [[Çukurova]] plain. Earthquake risk of the city is relatively low especially compared to other regions of Turkey, but due to its closeness to several other [[Fault (geology)|fault lines]] in Anatolia, the city center, which was built on an [[Alluvium|alluvial deposit]] is considered to be a risk region.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-02-23 |title=Mersin deprem bölgesi mi?
