'''Pompano Beach''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɒ|m|p|ən|oʊ}} {{respell|POM|pə|noh}}) is a city in [[Broward County, Florida]], United States. It is located along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, just north of [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]] and 36 miles north of [[Miami, Florida|Miami]]. The nearby [[Hillsboro Inlet]] forms part of the [[Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway]]. It is a principal city of the [[Miami metropolitan area]], which was home to 6.14 million people in 2020. As of the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]], the population was 112,046,<ref name="2020CensusPopulationByRace" /> making it the [[Broward County#Communities|sixth-largest city]] in Broward County, the [[Miami metropolitan area#cities|ninth-largest city]] in the [[South Florida metropolitan area]], and the [[List of municipalities in Florida|20th-largest city]] in Florida.

[[Pompano Beach Airpark]], located within the city, is the home of the [[Goodyear Blimp]] ''Spirit of Innovation''.<ref name="cityhistsoc"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nestseekers.com/ForSale/walkup/Pompano_Beach/|title=pompano beach walkups for sale|publisher=Nest Seekers International|access-date=September 19, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723065549/http://www.nestseekers.com/ForSale/walkup/Pompano_Beach/|archive-date=July 23, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Kester Cottages}}

[[Tequesta]] Indians lived in the area.<ref>[https://www.pompanohistory.com/our_history Our History]</ref>

The city's name is derived from the [[Florida pompano]] (''Trachinotus carolinus''), a fish found off the Atlantic coast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=8858|title=Profile for Pompano Beach, Florida, FL|publisher=ePodunk|access-date=September 22, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302184157/http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=8858|archive-date=March 2, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

There had been scattered settlers in the area since at least the mid-1880s, but the first documented permanent residents of the Pompano area were George Butler and Frank Sheen and their families, who arrived in 1896 as railway employees.<ref name="cityhistory">{{cite web |url=http://pompanobeachfl.gov/pages/misc_pages/residents/history/history.html.php |title=History of Pompano Beach, FL |publisher=City of Pompano Beach |access-date=July 4, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004223923/http://pompanobeachfl.gov/pages/misc_pages/residents/history/history.html.php |archive-date=October 4, 2013}}</ref> The first train arrived in the small Pompano settlement on February 22, 1896.<ref name="cityhistory" /> It is said that Sheen gave the community its name after jotting down on his survey of the area the name of the fish he had for dinner. The coming of the railroad led to development farther west from the coast. In 1906, Pompano became the southernmost settlement in newly created [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach County]].<ref name="cityhistory" /> That year, the [[Hillsboro Inlet Light|Hillsboro Lighthouse]] was completed on the beach.<ref name="cityhistory" />

On July 3, 1908, a new municipality was incorporated in what was then [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]]: the Town of Pompano.<ref name="cityhistsoc" /><ref name="cityhistory" /> John R. Mizell was elected the first mayor. In 1915, [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]] was established, with a northern boundary at the Hillsboro Canal. Thus, within eight years, Pompano had been in three counties.<ref name="cityhistsoc" /><ref name="cityhistory" /> Pompano Beach experienced significant growth during the Florida land boom of the 1920s. In 1940, the U.S. Supreme Court disallowed forced confessions in ''[[Chambers v. Florida]]'', a dispute stemming from a murder in Pompano Beach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://laws.findlaw.com/us/309/227.html|title=Find Laws, Legal Information, and Attorneys – FindLaw|access-date=July 1, 2016}}</ref>

Following the population boom due to [[World War II]], in 1947, the City of Pompano merged with the newly formed municipality on the beach and became the City of Pompano Beach.<ref name="cityhistsoc" /><ref name="collier">{{cite encyclopedia |editor=William D. Halsey |encyclopedia=Collier's Encyclopedia |title=Pompano Beach |year=1976 |publisher=Macmillan Educational Corporation |volume=19 |page=232}}</ref> In 1950, the population of the city reached 5,682. Like most of [[South Florida|southeast Florida]], Pompano Beach experienced great growth in the late 20th century as many people moved there from northern parts of the United States. A substantial seasonal population also spends its winters in the area. The city of Pompano Beach celebrated its centennial in 2008. It is twinned with [[West Bromwich]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

The majority of the initial inhabitants, both African American and white, in this region migrated from northern Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas, while some black residents also came from the [[Bahamas]].<ref>[https://www.pompanohistory.com/our_history]</ref>

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|65.8|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|62.2|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|3.6|km2|order=flip}}, or 5.54%, is water.<ref name="Census 2010">{{cite web|date=July 15, 2020|title=Census QuickFacts for Pompano Beach, Florida (2019)|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/pompanobeachcityflorida|website=Census.gov|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Fact Finder}}</ref>

A 2017 study showed 73,000 residents living within [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]]'s coastal [[floodplain]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.climatecentral.org/news/us-cities-most-vulnerable-major-coastal-flooding-sea-level-rise-21748|title=These U.S. Cities Are Most Vulnerable to Major Coastal Flooding and Sea Level Rise|date=October 25, 2017|website=www.climatecentral.org|language=en|access-date=December 19, 2019|archive-date=December 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191219210134/https://www.climatecentral.org/news/us-cities-most-vulnerable-major-coastal-flooding-sea-level-rise-21748|url-status=dead}}</ref>
