'''Iskandar Puteri''' (formerly known as '''Nusajaya''') is a [[Cities of Malaysia|city]] and the [[administrative capital]] of the state of [[Johor]], [[Malaysia]]. It hosts [[Kota Iskandar]], which represents the [[seat of government]] of the state of Johor ([[Menteri Besar of Johor|Executive branch]] & [[Johor State Legislative Assembly|Legislative branch]]).<ref>{{cite web|last=|date=7 December 2015|title=Johor's administrative capital Nusajaya to be renamed Iskandar Puteri|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/johors-administrative-capital-nusajaya-to-be-renamed-iskandar-puteri|website=Straits Times (Singapore)}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=|date=2017-11-22|title=Iskandar Puteri becomes Johor's second city|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/iskandar-puteri-becomes-johors-second-city|access-date=2021-08-19|website=The Straits Times|language=en}}</ref> Situated along the [[Straits of Johor]] at the southern end of the [[Malay Peninsula]], it is also the southernmost city in [[Peninsular Malaysia]].

Together with the adjacent cities of [[Johor Bahru]] (the official state capital of Johor) and [[Pasir Gudang]], it is located within the [[Johor Bahru District]]. They anchor Malaysia's third largest [[Urban area|urban]] agglomeration, [[Iskandar Malaysia]], with a population of 2.2 million ({{As of|2020|August}}).<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kamel|first=Engku Ahmad|date=2020-08-24|title=Iskandar Malaysia Updates|url=https://www.mdbc.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MDBC-Johor-State-Briefing-Interchamber-IRDA.pdf|website=Iskandar Regional Development Authority (IRDA), Malaysian Dutch Business Council}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Sempit Puteri ===
Historically, the area surrounding present-day Iskandar Puteri consisted mostly of fishing villages, populated by [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] and [[Orang Laut]] tribes. Located on the western side of the [[Strait of Johor|Tebrau Strait]], the area was once known as ''<span lang="ms" dir="ltr">Sempit Puteri</span>'' (narrow princess) as it was facing the narrowest point of the Tebrau Straits.

In 1855, when [[Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim]] won his claim over the [[Johor]] throne, he relocated the capital city of the now-divided kingdom from [[Telok Blangah]] ([[Singapore]]) to Tanjung Puteri and renamed it Iskandar Puteri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/metro/community/2015/12/31/nusajaya-is-now-iskandar-puteri-johor-reverts-to-its-old-name-as-it-has-historical-significance/|title=Nusajaya is now Iskandar Puteri - Metro News - The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my}}</ref> His son [[Abu Bakar of Johor|Maharaja Abu Bakar]], the first Sultan of Modern Johor, renamed Tanjung Puteri to '''[[Johor Bahru]]''' upon his coronation in 1868 to distinguish his dynasty from the old [[Sultanate of Johor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kemahkotaan.johor.gov.my/pengenalan/sejarah-kesultanan-johor/?lang=en|title=History of the Johor Sultanate|date=22 January 2015|access-date=11 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702012653/http://kemahkotaan.johor.gov.my/pengenalan/sejarah-kesultanan-johor/?lang=en|archive-date=2 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

During Abu Bakar's reign, [[Jaafar Muhammad]] was appointed as the first [[Menteri Besar of Johor]]. According to a story from Yayasan Warisan Johor, during his journey to Sempit Puteri, the paddle of the [[sampan]] that Dato Jaafar was boarding broke. That event gave the place its new name <span lang="ms" dir="ltr">Gelang Patah</span> (broken paddle). 

As many as eight local councils (<span lang="ms" dir="ltr">majlis tempatan</span>) were set up in the 1950s and 1960s to oversee municipal works in the area.<ref>{{cite web |title=Latar Belakang |date=January 2016 |url=https://www.mbip.gov.my/ms/mpjbt/profil/latar-belakang |access-date=22 October 2020}}</ref> The smaller local councils were merged in March 1978 and replaced by the Central Johor Bahru District Council (''Majlis Daerah Johor Bahru Tengah'', MDJBT), as the local authority in [[Johor Bahru]]'s western and northern suburban areas, while [[Johor Bahru City Council]] (MBJB) administers downtown [[Johor Bahru]]. MDJBT was granted municipal status in 2001.

=== Nusajaya===
In 1993, during the leadership of the fourth Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]], a plan for a [[Malaysia–Singapore Second Link|second bridge]] connecting the [[Peninsular Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] was brought forward by [[Halim Saad]]. Saad was as a young entrepreneur who built [[Malaysia]]'s longest highway, [[North–South Expressway (Malaysia)|North-South Expressway]], and apprentice to the former Minister of Finance [[Daim Zainuddin]]. The cabinet approved the project, as the traffic at the then [[Johor Causeway]] was already over-congested. The Second Link has connected Iskandar Puteri to [[Tuas]] in [[Singapore]]. His past experience enabled Halim to secure financing from Bank for Renong Berhad (now [[UEM Group]]) to acquire vast land along with the Second Link for a new township which was eventually deemed Nusajaya. The Nusajaya name was given by former [[Menteri Besar of Johor]], [[Muhyiddin Yassin]].

UEM Group through its subsidiary UEM Land (now UEM Sunrise) continue to develop Nusajaya as the new city centre of Johor. A new administrative centre, [[Kota Iskandar]] was developed by [[Cahaya Jauhar]] in Nusajaya based on the Federal Government administrative centre at [[Putrajaya]] as a catalyst to Nusajaya development. This is followed by the introduction of [[Iskandar Malaysia]], [[Iskandar Regional Development Authority]] and Iskandar Investment Board to regulate and promote the development growth in Nusajaya. In 2008, the Johor State Parliament was moved from [[Sultan Ibrahim Building]] in Johor Bahru to [[Sultan Ismail Building]] in Kota Iskandar. Several other catalyst developments were later added to Nusajaya. Among them are [[Legoland Malaysia Resort]], Puteri Harbour and Pinewood Malaysia Studio (now, Iskandar Malaysia Studio) and Southern Industrial And Logistics Clusters (SiLC). A new city, [[Medini Iskandar Malaysia|Medini]] was also developed as the capital for Nusajaya. UEM also sold part of Nusajaya land to other developers including [[Syed Mokhtar Albukhary]]'s Tradewind, [[SP Setia]] (Bukit Indah & Setia Eco Garden), Ecoworld (Eco Botanic), and [[Sunway Group]] (Sunway Iskandar) to expedite the development of Nusajaya.

=== Iskandar Puteri===
In January 2016, Nusajaya was once again renamed to Iskandar Puteri by [[Ibrahim Ismail of Johor|Sultan Ibrahim]], current [[Sultan of Johor]]. Johor Bahru Tengah Municipal Council was upgraded to [[Iskandar Puteri City Council]] on 22 November 2017.<ref name="thestar.com.my"/>{{Citation needed|date=November 2023}}

===Road===
Within Johor, the [[Iskandar Coastal Highway]] and [[Pasir Gudang Highway]] links the city to [[Johor Bahru|Johor Bahru City]], while the Tanjung Kupang Road links the city to [[Pontian District]]. The [[Second Link Expressway]] and [[North–South Expressway (Malaysia)|North–South Expressway]] connect the city to the other states in [[Peninsular Malaysia]].

The [[Malaysia–Singapore Second Link]] was built between Kampong Ladang at [[Tanjung Kupang]], Johor and Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim at [[Tuas]], Singapore. The bridge was built to reduce the traffic congestion at the [[Johor–Singapore Causeway]] and was opened to traffic on January 2nd, 1998. The twin-deck bridge supports a dual-three lane [[carriageway]] and its total length over water is 1,920 m.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_844_2005-01-07.html|title=Second Link|website=eresources.nlb.gov.sg}}</ref>
