'''Terrassa''' ({{IPA|ca|təˈrasə}}, {{langx|es|Tarrasa}} {{IPA|es|taˈrasa||Pronunciation of Terrasa in Spanish.ogg}}) is a city in central-eastern [[Catalonia]] and in the [[province of Barcelona]] ([[Spain]]). It is one of the two capitals of [[Vallès Occidental]] county, along with [[Sabadell]].

The name ''Terrassa'' derives from [[Latin]] ''Terracia'', either from earlier ''Terracium castellum'' (“earthen castle”),<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cardús |first=Salvador |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1123914215 |title=Nom i escut de Tarrassa |date=1961 |publisher=Patronat de la Fundació Soler i Palet |oclc=1123914215}}</ref> or meaning "terrace", "area of flat land".<ref>{{Cite book |first1=Josep |last1=Moran |first2=Mar |last2=Batlle |first3=Joan Anton |last3=Rabella i Ribas |title=Topònims catalans: etimologia i pronúncia |publisher=Abadia de Montserrat |year=2002 |isbn=8484154319 |location=Barcelona |pages=165 |language=ca}}</ref>

It is the site of Roman {{Ill|Egara|ca|Ègara}}, a former Visigothic bishopric, which became a Latin Catholic [[titular see]]. Since 2004, it is again the see of a [[Diocese of Terrassa|bishopric]].

The city is located in the Catalan Prelitoral depression (Depressió Prelitoral), at the feet of the Prelitoral mountain range ({{Ill|Natural reserve of Sant Llorenç del Munt|lt=natural reserve of Sant Llorenç del Munt|ca|Parc Natural de Sant Llorenç del Munt i l'Obac}}) and the average altitude of the city is 277 meters above sea level. It is 20 and 18 kilometres from [[Barcelona]] and [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]] respectively.

As of 2020, Terrassa was the third largest city in Catalonia, after [[Barcelona]] and [[l'Hospitalet de Llobregat]].

== History ==
{{More citations needed|section|date=August 2022}}
[[File:Masia Freixa 1.JPG|thumb|left|250px|The [[Masia Freixa]] of Terrassa, sea of parabolic arches]]
The remains that have been found indicate that the area where Terrassa stands has been inhabited since prehistory. In 2005, during the construction of a tunnel for one of the city's railway lines, a prehistoric site was found in [[Vallparadís Park]], with stone tools and fossils of hunted animals dating back 800,000 to 1,000,000 years, making this one of the oldest prehistoric sites in Europe.

Terrassa originated as the Roman town of ''Egara'' (''Municipium Flavium Egara''), which was founded during the time of the emperor [[Vespasian]] (69–79 CE), alongside the torrent of Vallparadís (nowadays an urban park) close to the [[Iberians|Iberian]] town of ''Egosa'', on the site of which some ceramics and coins have been found.

In the 17th century it was the sight of the [[Terrassa witch trials|Terrasa witchtrials]], where 6 women were arrested, tortured and convicted of witchcraft. Five of them were hanged on 27 October 1619 near a present-day railway bridge.<ref>{{Cite web|title=¿Qué eran y quiénes eran las brujas catalanas?|url=https://www.elnacional.cat/es/opinion/marc-pons-reportatge-brujas-catalanas_530646_102.html|access-date=13 September 2020|website=ElNacional.cat|archive-date=30 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201030103458/https://www.elnacional.cat/es/opinion/marc-pons-reportatge-brujas-catalanas_530646_102.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Other important remains from the Middle Ages are the former cathedral, the castle of Vallparadís (from 1344 to 1413 a [[Carthusian]] monastery and today a municipal museum) and the tower of the castle-palace of the [[Counts of Barcelona|count-king]].

In the 19th century the city played an important role in the industrial revolution, specializing in woollen fabrics, and today there is a major ''[[Modernisme|Modernista]]'' legacy as a result of the city's importance at that time. Particularly notable ''Modernista'' buildings include the [[Masia Freixa]] (1907), the Vapor Aymerich, Amat i Jover [[textile mill]] (1907) (now the [[MNACTEC|Museum of Science and Industry of Catalonia]]), the Principal theater (1920), the city hall (1902), the Alegre de Sagrera house/museum (1911), [[School of Engineering of Terrassa|the Industrial School]] (1904), the Gran Casino (1920), the Parc de Desinfecció (1920), and the Independència market (1908).

Terrassa is a partner city of the [[Réseau Art Nouveau Network|Art nouveau network]],<ref>[http://www.artnouveau-net.eu Art Nouveau network] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200818130721/https://artnouveau-net.eu/ |date=18 August 2020 }}, artnouveau-net.eu. Accessed 4 August 2022.</ref> a European network of co-operation created in 1999 for the study, preservation and development of [[Art Nouveau]].

Terrassa is a famous [[Filmmaking|movie production]] center in [[Europe]] and was named a [[City of Film]] by [[UNESCO]]. The city is home to the largest film studios in [[Catalonia]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the [[Parc Audiovisual de Catalunya]], where numerous movies and TV Shows such as [[Rec (film)|REC]], [[A Monster Calls (film)|A Monster Calls]] and [[Operación Triunfo (Spanish TV series)|Operación Triunfo]] have been filmed.

=== Catastrophes ===
{{See also|1962 Vallés floods}}[[File:Flood 1962.jpg|alt= Terrassa Flood 1962|thumb|Results of the 1962 flood in Terrassa the day after. Picture obtained in the Tobella's archive.]]
On 25 September 1962, after a long dry summer, between 212 and 252 litres of rain per square metre fell in three hours. It caused the rivers [[Llobregat]] and [[Besòs (river)|Besòs]] and their tributaries to overflow, creating a water avenue that caused 700 victims and heavy material losses.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

The [[Vallès Occidental]] ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' was the most damaged. In particularly Terrassa, with 327 victims. The reason of these numbers was that building was permitted around two dry streams used to bring rain water to the [[Llobregat]] river. They met in a wedge shape and were not properly [[Channelized (river)|channelized]]. When the streams overflowed it created what was called "the dead triangle", with more than a hundred victims only in the Ègara neighbourhood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://recordsdeterrassa.wordpress.com/riuades-1962/|title=Riuades 1962|date=4 March 2012|language=ca-ES|access-date=13 July 2016|archive-date=16 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316223829/https://recordsdeterrassa.wordpress.com/riuades-1962/|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Ecclesiastical history ==
[[File:Egara. Conjunt episcopal.jpg|thumb|right|500px|Ancient churches of Ègara.]]
The episcopal see of Ègara already existed by about 450 CE, when it was established on territory split off from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Barcelona|Roman Catholic Diocese of Barcelona]], under the Metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Tarragona]]. [[Pope Hilarius]] confirmed its autonomy by denying a request around 469 to unite it with the Barcelona under its own first bishop, Ireneus.

It comprised parts of these [[Comarques of Catalonia]] (Catalan districts) : [[Alt Penedès]], [[Anoia]], [[Baix Llobregat]], [[Vallès Occidental]] and [[Vallès Oriental]]. A Provincial Council of Tarragona was held there in 615.

It effectively succumbed to the Arab (Muslim) conquest in the 8th century and was probably suppressed, its territory being (rather nominally) returned to the [[Diocese of Barcelona]]. The Marian cathedral continued to exist until 718, when it was taken over during the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]], but was rebuilt in the 12th century, and remains part of a monumental complex of ancient [[Visigoths|Visigothic]]-[[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] churches of Sant Pere de Terrassa and Sant Miquel on the site.

After the Catholic [[Reconquista]] of the region in the tenth century, the see was not restored, its territory being incorporated in the (mother) diocese of Barcelona. Why a request to restore the bishopric by its Metropolitan of Tarragona, Cesareo, wasn't honored by [[Pope John XII]] (955–964) is unclear.

In 2004, [[Pope John Paul II]] created the new [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Terrassa|Diocese of Terrassa]] on territory taken from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Barcelona|Archdiocese of Barcelona]]. Its seat is the [[Terrassa Cathedral|Cathedral of Holy Sprit]].

These three churches were built close to the site of old Ègara to be the seat of the Ègara [[Diocese]], which was founded around 450 CE and remained in existence until the 8th century. This episcopal complex follows the Byzantine model of antiquity, with two churches (Sant Pere and Santa Maria) and a [[mausoleum]] (Sant Miquel). After a long period of construction, the churches were finished in the then-current manner about the 11th and 12th centuries and in Romanesque style, on the site of the pre-Romanesque buildings of the Visigothic period.
The church of Santa Maria contains outstanding works of art, and there are murals dating from the Romanesque period to the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]].

== Transportation ==
Terrassa is well connected with Barcelona's port and airport by highway and railway. The C-58 and [[C-16 (highway)|C-16]] also link the city with ([[Manresa]]), ([[Girona]], France), and ([[Tarragona]]).

The railway reached Terrassa in 1856, and nowadays two lines serve the city. The first, operated by [[Renfe]], connects with Barcelona and [[Lleida]], and the second, operated by [[Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya|FGC]], with Barcelona. Recently FGC extended its line to the north of the city, building three new stations; one of them acts as a rail hub with the Renfe line. This extension is known as the [[Terrassa Metro]].

Several interurban bus lines connect Terrassa with the closest cities and towns such as [[Sabadell]], [[Castellar del Vallès]], [[Martorell]], [[Rubí, Barcelona|Rubí]], [[Sant Cugat del Vallès]] and [[Vacarisses]].

Transport inside the city is provided by 14 bus lines operated by a municipal company (Transports Municipals d'Ègara). In the future, when the three new FGC stations and the two planned for the Renfe line are in use, the railway will also serve as urban transport.

== Culture ==

=== Music and theater ===

A lot of musicians and actors are based in Terrassa because of the large number of music schools, a long amateur theater tradition and the local seat of the University of Drama. Since 1982, the Terrassa Jazz Festival has been especially outstanding, with guests like [[Stan Getz]], [[Chet Baker]], [[Dexter Gordon]], [[Tete Montoliu]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]].  Local bands such as [[Doctor Prats]] have also developed a national and international following.<ref>{{citation |language=ca |url=http://www.terrassadigital.cat/detall_actualitat/?id=25681#.VxEByPmLTIU |title=Els terrassencs Doctor Prats fan el seu primer concert en directe a Faktoria |trans-title=The Terrassan group Doctor Prats give their first live concert in Faktoria |work=terrassadigital.cat |access-date=19 March 2020 |archive-date=19 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919095800/http://www.terrassadigital.cat/detall_actualitat/?id=25681#.VxEByPmLTIU |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Sports ==
Terrassa was a pioneer in the introduction of [[field hockey]] and [[korfball]] in Catalonia and played an important role in the introduction of [[basketball]]. The most important sport in the city is field hockey. During the [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona Olympic Games]] in 1992, Terrassa was the city where the field hockey competition was played. The great number of hockey players from Terrassa who have participated in the [[Olympic Games]] over the years has led to Terrassa's being referred to as the "most Olympic city in the world". Between 1928 and 2004, Terrassa sent 124 athletes to the Olympic Games, the majority of whom were hockey players. Three local field hockey clubs, [[Atlètic Terrassa Hockey Club|Atlètic Terrassa]], [[Club Egara]] and Club Deportiu Terrassa have all won the [[División de Honor de Hockey Hierba]] and the [[Copa del Rey de Hockey Hierba]]. Atlètic Terrassa and Club Egara have also won the [[EuroHockey Club Champions Cup]].

Other local sports teams include Club de Rugby Carboners de Terrassa, [[CN Terrassa]] ([[water polo]]), [[Terrassa FC]] (association football), [[CP San Cristóbal]] (association football) and Sferic Terrassa ([[basketball]]).

Terrassa is the home and birthplace of [[FC Barcelona]] and [[Spain men's national football team|Spain national football team]] midfielders [[Xavi (footballer, born 1980)|Xavi]] and [[Dani Olmo]].

The city's [[castell]]s teams are the [[Minyons de Terrassa]] and the [[Castellers de Terrassa]]. On 22 November 2015, Terrassa's Plaça Vella was the scene of the world's first successful ''4 de 10 amb folre i manilles'', completed by the Minyons.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Martín|first1=Carol|title=Els Minyons de Terrassa fan història en descarregar el quatre de deu amb folre i manilles|url=http://www.ara.cat/societat/Minyons-Terrassa-historia-descarregar-quatre-de-deu-folre-manilles_0_1472252945.html|access-date=22 November 2015|work=Ara|date=12 November 2015|archive-date=23 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123031813/http://www.ara.cat/societat/Minyons-Terrassa-historia-descarregar-quatre-de-deu-folre-manilles_0_1472252945.html|url-status=live}}</ref>
