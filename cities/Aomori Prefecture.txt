Aomori is the northernmost prefecture on [[Japan]]'s main island, [[Honshu]], and is bordered by the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the east, [[Iwate Prefecture]] to the southeast, [[Akita Prefecture]] to the southwest, the [[Sea of Japan]] to the west, and [[Hokkaido]] across the [[Tsugaru Strait]] to the north. Aomori Prefecture is the [[List of Japanese prefectures by area|8th-largest prefecture]], with an area of {{cvt|9,645.64|sqkm|sqmi|sp=us}}, and the [[List of Japanese prefectures by population|31st-most populous prefecture]], with more than 1.18&nbsp;million people. Approximately 45 percent of Aomori Prefecture's residents live in its two [[Core cities of Japan|core cities]], Aomori and [[Hachinohe]], which lie on coastal plains. The majority of the prefecture is covered in forested mountain ranges, with population centers occupying valleys and plains. Aomori is the third-most populous prefecture in the Tōhoku region, after [[Miyagi Prefecture]] and [[Fukushima Prefecture]]. [[Mount Iwaki]], an active [[stratovolcano]], is the prefecture's highest point, at almost {{cvt|1624.7|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}.

Humans have inhabited the prefecture for at least 15,000 years, and the oldest evidence of pottery in Japan was discovered at the [[Jōmon period]] [[Odai Yamamoto I site]]. After centuries of rule by the [[Nanbu clan|Nanbu]] and [[Tsugaru clan]]s, the prefecture was formed out of the northern part of [[Mutsu Province]] during the [[Meiji Restoration]]. Though the prefecture remains dominated by [[Primary sector of the economy|primary sector]] industries, it also serves as a transportation hub due to its location at the northern end of Honshu.

===Jōmon period===
[[File:Odai Yamamoto I potsherds.jpg|thumb|Potsherds from the Odai Yamamoto I site]]
The oldest evidence of pottery in Japan was found at the [[Odai Yamamoto I site]] in the town of [[Sotogahama]] in the northwestern part of the prefecture.

===Yayoi period to Heian period===
{{See also|Mutsu Province}}
During the Yayoi period, the area that would become Aomori Prefecture was impacted by the migration of settlers from continental Asia to a lesser extent than the rest of Japan to the south and west of the region. The region, known then as Michinoku, was inhabited by the [[Emishi]]. It is not clear if the Emishi were the descendants of the Jōmon people, a group of the [[Ainu people]], or if both the Ainu and Emishi were descended from the Jōmon people. The northernmost tribe of the Emishi that inhabited what would become Aomori Prefecture was known as the Tsugaru.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kazuro Hanihara |title=Emishi, Ezo and Ainu: An Anthropological Perspective |journal=Japan Review |year=1990 |issue=1 |pages=35–48 |jstor=25790886}}</ref> Historic records mention a series of destructive eruptions in 917 from the volcano at [[Lake Towada]].

The port was expanded under the rule of the Andō clan. They traded heavily with the Ainu in [[Ezo]]. However, conflict would break out between the Ainu and the Andō clan in 1268 and again in the 1320s. The conflict was put down after the Nanbu intervened at the behest of the shogunate. The conflict weakened the Kamakura shogunate in its later years, while the Andō were split into northern (Andō) and southern (Akita) divisions.<ref>{{cite web |title=陸奥・福島城(青森県・十三湊)の見どころと安藤氏の乱 |date=12 September 2017 |trans-title=Mutsu and Fukushima Castle (Aomori Prefecture, Tosaminato) highlights and the Andō Rebellion |url=https://sirotabi.com/556/#i-3 |language=ja |access-date=1 July 2020}}</ref>

===Muromachi period===
[[File:Horigoshi Castle moat.jpg|thumb|The remains of Horikoshi Castle]]
At the onset of the [[Ashikaga shogunate]], the Nanbu and Andō continued to rule the area, with the Nanbu controlling the current prefecture's southeastern section and the Andō controlling the [[Shimokita Peninsula|Shimokita]] and [[Tsugaru Peninsula|Tsugaru]] peninsulas. The Andō also were involved with controlling the fringes of Ezo, splitting their attention. In 1336, the Andō completed construction of [[Horikoshi Castle]] during the [[Northern and Southern Courts period]].<ref name="Tsugaru castle">{{cite web |year=2014 |title=津軽氏城跡 |trans-title=Tsugaru Castle ruins |url=http://www.city.hirosaki.aomori.jp/gaiyou/bunkazai/kuni/kuni29.html |access-date=1 July 2020 |work=Hirosaki City |language=ja}}</ref> During the Muromachi, the Nanbu slowly began edging the Andō out of present-day Aomori Prefecture. The Andō were pushed out of Tosaminato in 1432, retreating to Ezo, giving the Nanbu control over all their lands. The port settlement would fall into disrepair under the Nanbu.<ref name="Tosa"/>

===Sengoku period===
During the Sengoku period, the Nanbu clan collapsed into several rival factions. One faction under [[Tsugaru Tamenobu|Ōura Tamenobu]] asserted their control over the [[Hirosaki Domain]]. His clan, originally the {{nihongo|Ōura clan|大浦氏|Ōura-shi}}, was of uncertain origins. According to later Tsugaru clan records, the clan was descended from the noble [[Fujiwara clan]] and had an accent claim to ownership of the Tsugaru region on the Tsugaru Peninsula and the area surrounding Mount Iwaki in the northwestern corner of Mutsu Province; however, according to the records of their rivals, the Nanbu clan, clan progenitor Ōura Tamenobu was born as either Nanbu Tamenobu or Kuji Tamenobu, from a minor branch house of the Nanbu and was driven from the clan due to discord with his elder brother.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ravina |first=Mark |title=Land and Lordship in Early Modern Japan |year=1999 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=0804728984 |page=117}}</ref> In any event, the Ōura were hereditary {{nihongo|vice-district magistrate|郡代補佐|gundai hosa}} under the Nanbu clan's local magistrate Ishikawa Takanobu; however, in 1571, Tamenobu attacked and killed Ishikawa and began taking the Nanbu clan's castles in the Tsugaru region one after another.<ref name="rd1">{{in lang|ja}} "Tokugawa Bakufu to Tozama 117 han."

After pledging fealty to [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], he was confirmed as an independent warlord in 1590 and changed his name to "Tsugaru", formally establishing the [[Tsugaru clan]]. Tsugaru Tamenobu assisted Hideyoshi at the [[Siege of Odawara (1590)|Battle of Odawara]], and accompanied his retinue to [[Hizen Province|Hizen]] during the Korean Expedition. Afterwards, he sided with [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] during the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600.<ref>Edwin McClellan (1985).

===Edo period===
[[File:Hirosaki-castle Aomori JAPAN.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hirosaki Castle]], the [[Edo period]] seat of the [[Tsugaru clan]].]]
After the establishment of the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]], the Nanbu ruled the Shimokita Peninsula and the districts immediately to the south of it. The area to the west of the Nanbu's holdings and to the north of the lands held by the Akita clan were all controlled by the Tsugaru clan, from their capital at [[Hirosaki]]. Work on [[Hirosaki Castle]] was completed in 1611, replacing Horikoshi Castle as the Tsugaru clan's fortress.<ref name="Tsugaru castle"/> By 1631, the Tsugaru clan had solidified their control over their gains made during the Sengoku period.<ref>{{cite web |title=弘前公園の歴史 |trans-title=History of Hirosaki Park |url=https://www.hirosakipark.jp/history.html |work=Hirosaki Park |date=3 April 2012 |language=ja |access-date=1 July 2020}}</ref> Mutsu Province was struck by the [[Tenmei famine]] between 1781 and 1789, due to lower than usual temperatures that were exacerbated by volcanic eruptions at [[Mount Iwaki]], near the Tsugaru clan's capital, Hirosaki, between November 1782 and June 1783.<ref>{{cite web |title=「命を救った食べ物～飢饉の歴史と生きるための食物～」 |trans-title=Food that saves life, the history of food production during famines |url=http://www2.pref.iwate.jp/~hp2088/park/kikaku/49th_inochi_tabemono.html |access-date=9 July 2020 |publisher=Iwate Prefecture Government |language=ja}}</ref>

At the beginning of the Edo period, the last pockets of Ainu people in Honshu still lived in the mountainous areas on the peninsulas of the prefecture. They interacted with the ruling clans to some extent, but they primarily lived off of fishing the waters of [[Mutsu Bay]] and the [[Tsugaru Strait]]. However, the Tsugaru clan made two big pushes to assimilate the Ainu, the first came in 1756 and the second came in 1809. Records show that the clan was successful in wiping out the Ainu culture in their holdings, though some geographic names in Aomori Prefecture still retain their original Ainu names.<ref>{{cite news |title=アイヌ語と津軽半島 |trans-title=Ainu language and the Tsugaru Peninsula |url=http://www.mutusinpou.co.jp/%E6%B4%A5%E8%BB%BD%E3%81%AE%E8%A1%97%E3%81%A8%E9%A2%A8%E6%99%AF/2014/11/34027.html |language=ja |date=24 November 2014 |access-date=2 July 2020}}</ref>

Despite the 1867 resignation of the last shogun, [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]], the [[Boshin War]] had reached northern Japan by late 1868. On 20 September 1868 the pro-Shōgunate [[Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei]] was proclaimed at [[Morioka]], the capital of the Nanbu clan who ruled [[Morioka Domain]]. The Tsugaru clan first sided with the pro-imperial forces of [[Satchō Alliance]], and attacked nearby [[Shōnai Domain]].<ref name="McClellan, p. 175">McClellan, p. 175.</ref><ref>Mark Ravina (1999), ''Land and Lordship in Early Modern Japan'' (California: Stanford University Press), pp. 152–153.</ref> However, the Tsugaru soon switched course, and briefly became a member of the Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei.<ref>Onodera, p. 140.</ref> However, for reasons yet unclear, the Tsugaru backed out of the alliance and re-joined the imperial cause after a few months.

As a result of the minor skirmish, the Tsugaru clan was able to prove its defection from the Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei and loyalty to the imperial cause.

==Geography==
[[File:Aomori Prefecture Photo NASA MODIS 2003.jpg|thumb|Aomori Prefecture and the surrounding area as seen from space]]

Aomori Prefecture is the northernmost [[prefecture]] in the Tōhoku region, lying on the northern end of the island of [[Honshu]]. It faces [[Hokkaido]] from across the [[Tsugaru Strait]] and it borders [[Akita Prefecture|Akita]] and [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]] in the south. The prefecture is flanked by the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the east and the [[Sea of Japan]] to the west with the Tsugaru Strait linking those bodies of water to the north of the prefecture. The islets of [[Kyūroku-jima]] in the Sea of Japan are the prefecture's westernmost point.<ref>{{cite web |title=場所・気候 |trans-title=Place/climate |url=https://www.pref.aomori.lg.jp/kids/02_climate.html |language=ja |publisher=Aomori Prefecture Government |date=20 May 2020 |access-date=28 September 2020}}</ref> [[Oma, Aomori|Oma]], at the northwestern tip of the axe-shaped [[Shimokita Peninsula]], is the northernmost point of Honshu. The [[Shimokita Peninsula|Shimokita]] and [[Tsugaru Peninsula]]s enclose [[Mutsu Bay]]. Between those peninsulas lies the smaller [[Natsudomari Peninsula]], the northern end of the [[Ōu Mountains]]. The three peninsulas are prominently visible in the prefecture's symbol, a stylized map.<ref name="Takaaki">{{cite book |author=Takaaki Nihei |title=The Regional Geography of Japan |publisher=The Hokkaido University Press |date=2018 |isbn=978-4-8329-0373-9 |pages=13–19 |location=Sapporo}}</ref>

[[Lake Ogawara]], a [[brackish]] lake at the base of the Shimokita Peninsula, is the eleventh largest lake in Japan, the largest brackish lake in the Tōhoku area, and the prefecture's largest lake.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lake Ogawara Brackish Water Clam |url=https://gi-act.maff.go.jp/en/register/entry/52.html |work=Information Website on Japan's Geographical Indications |publisher=[[Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Japan)|Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries]] |date=21 February 2020 |access-date=16 October 2020}}</ref> [[Lake Towada]], a lake that sits in a volcanic [[caldera]], straddles Aomori's boundary with Akita.

Another feature of the park, the [[Hakkōda Mountains]], an expansive [[volcanic group]], rises in the lands to the south of the city of Aomori and north of Lake Towada.<ref name="Takaaki"/>

[[Shirakami-Sanchi]], a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is located in the Shirakami Mountains in the western part of the prefecture. The site contains the largest surviving virgin beech forest in East Asia which is home to over 87 species of birds. Mount Iwaki, a stratovolcano and the prefecture's highest point lies to northeast of the Shirakami Mountains. The lands to the east and northeast of Mount Iwaki are an expansive [[floodplain]] that is drained by the [[Iwaki River]]. [[Hirosaki]], the former capital of the [[Tsugaru clan]], sits on the banks of the river.<ref name="Takaaki"/>

As of 31 March 2019, 12% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as [[List of national parks of Japan#History|Natural Parks]], namely the Towada-Hachimantai and [[Sanriku Fukkō National Park|Sanriku Fukkō]] National Parks; [[Shimokita Hanto Quasi-National Park|Shimokita Hantō]] and [[Tsugaru Quasi-National Park|Tsugaru]] Quasi-National Parks; and [[Asamushi-Natsudomari Prefectural Natural Park|Asamushi-Natsudomari]], [[Ashino Chishōgun Prefectural Natural Park|Ashino Chishōgun]], [[Iwaki Kōgen Prefectural Natural Park|Iwaki Kōgen]], [[Kuroishi Onsenkyō Prefectural Natural Park|Kuroishi Onsenkyō]], [[Nakuidake Prefectural Natural Park|Nakuidake]], [[Ōwani Ikarigaseki Onsenkyō Prefectural Natural Park|Ōwani Ikarigaseki Onsenkyō]], and [[Tsugaru Shirakami Prefectural Natural Park|Tsugaru Shirakami]] Prefectural Natural Parks; and [[Mount Bonju Prefectural Forest]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.env.go.jp/park/doc/data/natural/naturalpark_4.pdf |script-title=ja:自然公園都道府県別面積総括 |trans-title=General overview of area figures for Natural Parks by prefecture |language=ja |publisher=[[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] |access-date=16 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pref.aomori.lg.jp/nature/nature/s-kouen_kouen.html |script-title=ja:青森県内の自然公園 |trans-title=Natural Parks in Aomori Prefecture |language=ja |publisher=Aomori Prefecture |date=31 March 2017 |access-date=16 August 2019}}</ref>

===Climate===
The climate of Aomori Prefecture is relatively cool for the most part. It has four distinct seasons with an average temperature of {{cvt|10|C}}. Variations in climate exist between the eastern (Pacific Ocean side) and the western (Sea of Japan side) parts of the prefecture. This is in part due to the [[Ōu Mountains]] that run north to south in the middle of the prefecture, dividing the two regions. The western side is subject to heavy monsoons and little sunshine which results in heavy snowfall during the winter. The eastern side is subject to low clouds brought in by northeasterly winds during the summer months, known locally as Yamase winds, from June through August, with temperatures staying relatively low. However, there are instances of Yamase winds making summers so cold that food production is hindered. The lowest recorded temperature during the winter is {{cvt|-9.3|C}}, and the highest recorded temperature during the summer is {{cvt|33.1|C}}.<ref name="Takaaki"/><ref>{{cite journal|first=Hiroshi |last=Takai |title=Characteristics of the Yamase Winds over Oceans around Japan Observed by the Scatterometer-Derived Ocean Surface Vector Winds |url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jmsj/84/2/84_2_365/_pdf/-char/en |journal=Journal of the Meteorological Society of Japan |pages=365–373 |volume=84 | issue=2|year=2006 |doi=10.2151/jmsj.84.365 |bibcode=2006JMeSJ..84..365T |access-date=16 October 2022|doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Dialects==
[[Tōhoku dialect]], one of the three main dialects of Japan, is spoken in Aomori Prefecture. The most widespread variants are the [[Tsugaru dialect]], Nanbu dialect, and Shimokita dialect.
