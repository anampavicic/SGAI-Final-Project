==Economic Development==
During the 12th Five-Year Plan period, Haining's GDP grew at a compound annual growth rate of 8.24%, ranking the first in Jiaxing.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} In 2016, its GDP reached RMB 74.41 billion, an increase of 6.4% over the previous year, which accounts for 19.8% of the total GDP of Jiaxing, with per capita GDP of RMB 109,600, 1.34 times as much as that of Jiaxing.<ref name="deloitte" /> In 2016, the industrial structure of Haining was increasingly optimized towards one that the tertiary industry accounts for the largest percentage and the primary industry the smallest. The value added of the secondary industry of the city was RMB 32.68 billion in 2016, playing a dominant role with a percentage of 53.5% among the three levels of industries; and the tertiary industry which saw a rapid growth, accounted for 43.9%, representing 55.6% of the GDP growth.

In recent years, Haining has adopted a project- driven model for industrial development, and kept promoting the launch of major real economy projects, with a view to providing strong support for industrial transformation.<ref name="deloitte" /> In 2016, the total output value of industrial enterprises with an annual revenue of RMB 20 million or more increased by 3.6% to RMB 145.6 billion, with the value added reaching 28.05 billion RMB, up by 5.2%. In 2016, the fixed asset investment in Haining was RMB 55.54 billion, an increase of 8.0% over the previous year. The productive investment in the city reached RMB 25.23 billion, rising by 11.1%, with the proportion in the total fixed asset investment increasing to 45.42% from 44.16%, leading to an increasingly optimized investment structure. With the transformation and upgrading of industrial clusters, Haining has witnessed an increasing demand for investment in technical reformation.

==Culture==
Haining is famous for its leather-silhouette show (also known as [[shadow play]]), colored [[lanterns]], and [[tidal bore]] viewing.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}
Haining began to be inhabited as early as the New Stone Age some 6,000 years ago. During the Spring and Autumn period (770-476BC), it became part of the State of the Wu and then belonged to the State of the Yue before coming under the State of the Chu. In 221BC, during the Qin dynasty, it fell under the jurisdiction of Changshui County (present-day Jiaxing). In 223AD, or the second year of the reign of Wu State King Huangwu of the Three Kingdoms period, it became known as Yanguan County. In 1295, or the first year of the reign of Yuan Emperor Yuanzheng, the county was promoted to be Yuanguan Prefecture. It became Haining Prefecture in 558. As the sea often encroached upon the prefecture via the Qiantangjiang River, the area was renamed Haining Prefecture in 1329 in the hope of calming the waves (in Chinese, "hai" means sea and "ning" to calm or pacify), and it remains so today. Following the founding the PRC, the area became Haining County, and then Haining City in November 1986 with the approval of the State Council.<ref>{{cite web|title=HAINING-CHINA|url=http://en.haining.gov.cn/|publisher=HaiNing Municipal People's Government}}</ref>
