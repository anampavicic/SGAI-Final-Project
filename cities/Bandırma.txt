== History ==
=== Pre Byzantine and Byzantine period ===

[[File:Bandirma Cyzicus Zeus temple 2857.jpg|thumb|Bandırma Cyzicus Zeus temple]]
The first archaeological research about the region was carried out by Kurt Bittel in 1952 and in the light of the archaeological data obtained as a result of excavations and geographical information provided by the ancient texts, from late [[Neolithic]] Age. Scientific studies were carried out in 1954 by Prof. Dr. [[Ekrem Akurgal]]. The excavation continued until 1960, and in 1988, Prof. Dr. It was restarted by [[Tomris Bakır]]. Common archaeological data in both excavations reveal the history of the region, determining that there are Neolithic settlements dating back to the middle of the 6th millennium BC and Chalcolithic settlements from the end of the 5th millennium BC. The ancient ruins of [[Dascylium|Daskyleion]] are also in the region. It is thought that the first settlement was inhabited between 7,000 BC and 5,000 BC. The settlement of Panormos, which means "safe harbor", was within the ancient region of [[Mysia]]. In 334 BC, [[Alexander the Great]] annexed the territory held by the Persians to his own state. After the death of Alexander, the region was conquered by the Romans. Bandırma, which remained in the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] after the division of the Roman Empire in 330, was captured by [[Qutalmish|Kutalmış]] in 1076; however, the region passed back to the Eastern Roman Empire in 1106.
