The state is home to two significant indigenous populations, the [[Huichol people|Huichols]] and the [[Nahua peoples|Nahuas]].

Agriculture began in the same region around 7,000 years ago, giving rise to the first permanent settlements in western Mexico.<ref name="aborigengob"/>  Ceramics began to be produced about 3,500 years ago for both utilitarian and ceremonial purposes.

In the sixty-year period from 1825 to 1885, Jalisco witnessed twenty-seven peasant (primarily indigenous) rebellions.

The national struggles between Liberals and Conservatives continued in the 1850s and 1860s, with Jalisco's government changing eighteen times between 1855 and 1864. While there was support for Federalism, most Liberals were politically aligned against the Church, which enjoyed strong support in the state.<ref name="houston"/> During the [[Reform War]], [[Benito Juárez]]'s Liberal government was forced out of Mexico City, arriving to Guadalajara in 1858. Despite this, Conservatives in power made Jalisco a department under direct rule from Mexico City. Jalisco remained mostly in Conservative hands until 1861.<ref name="cronologiagob"/> The war was devastating to the state's economy and forcing mass migrations. Of the thirty most important battles of the Reform War, twelve took place in Jalisco territory.<ref name="houston"/>

The end of the century would be dominated by the policies of Mexican President [[Porfirio Díaz]]. Livestock, which had been a traditional economic pillar of the state, began to decline during this time.

Opposition to the Díaz regime was not organized in the state with only isolated groups of miners, students and professionals staging strikes and protests. Presidential challenger [[Francisco I.

However, these were isolated incidences and did not coalesce into an organized army to confront the federal government.<ref name="enchis"/> Carranza vied for power in the state with [[Álvaro Obregón]] and [[Francisco Villa]] during the early part of the war with skirmishes among the various forces, especially between those loyal to Carranza and Villa.<ref name="enchis"/>

The new restrictions on the Church by the Constitution were followed by further laws against the practice of religion which were not supported by many in the state.

From the 1950s, the major concern for the state has been economic development. Most of the state's development has been concentrated in its capital of Guadalajara, resulting is economic inequality in the state.<ref name="enchis"/>

This was a time of freedom for them, before they became tethered to the growing of maize. Agriculture is difficult in the mountainous areas where they live. Elaborate ceremonies are enacted to help ensure crops’ success. There are three basic elements in Huichol religion, which are corn, deer and the [[peyote]] cactus. Peyote is obtained by a yearly pilgrimage to an area called [[Wirikuta]], where it is harvested with great ceremony.<ref name="rotey">{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/183-the-huichol-of-jalisco-and-nayarit |title=The Huichol of Jalisco and Nayarit |first=Robert |last=Otey |date=1 May 1997 |publisher=Mexconnect |issn=1028-9089 |access-date=9 September 2011 |archive-date=3 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303050230/http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/183-the-huichol-of-jalisco-and-nayarit |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Culture==
The idiom ''Jalisco es México'' ("Jalisco is Mexico") is commonly used to refer to how many of the things which are typically associated with Mexico have their origins in Jalisco. These include [[mariachi]]s, rodeos called [[charreada]]s and [[jaripeo]]s, dresses with wide skirts decorated with ribbons, the [[Mexican Hat Dance]], [[tequila]], and the wide-brimmed sombrero hat.<ref name="generalidades"/><ref name="houston"/>

===Mariachi and other music===
[[File:Mariachi Juvenil Sangre Azteca (MJSA).jpg|thumb|left|[[Mariachi]], which originates in Jalisco, is often considered to be the [[Musical nationalism|national music]] of Mexico.]]
Mexico's best known music, mariachi, is still strongly associated with the state within Mexico, although mariachi bands are popular in many parts of the country. It is a myth that the origin of the name comes from the French word for marriage, as the word existed before the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French Intervention in Mexico]]. Its true origin is unknown but one theory states that it has an indigenous origin. Another postulates that it comes from a local pronunciation of a common mariachi song "María ce son". It is thought to have originated from the town of Cocula, and this kind of band, with variations, spread into Sinaloa, Michoacán, Colima, Nayarit and Zacatecas. The music became most developed in and around the city of Guadalajara,<ref name="mariachigob">{{cite web |url=http://www.jalisco.gob.mx/wps/portal/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gzb2djr1AXEwMDF383A0_3MEdXxwBDD0dLc6B8pFm8T4iPh7FXkJGBv4mPsYGRm7-Po0uQqwEQENAdDrIPv36QvAEO4GiAV7-Jjzl--TBDfT-P_NxU_YLcCINMT11HAH03lqQ!/dl3/d3/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnZ3LzZfNktDM0pVRDQwMERPRjBJR1ZBRUFQMUhBOTc!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/portaljalisco2009/contenidos/gobierno+del+estado+jalisco/jalisco/pj_asfolklor/pj_conthistomariachijalisco |title=Historia del Mariachi |author=Ricardo Ivo Ramirez Lamas |date=11 January 2011 |publisher=State of Jalisco |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=History of Mariachi |access-date=9 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326180553/http://www.jalisco.gob.mx/wps/portal/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gzb2djr1AXEwMDF383A0_3MEdXxwBDD0dLc6B8pFm8T4iPh7FXkJGBv4mPsYGRm7-Po0uQqwEQENAdDrIPv36QvAEO4GiAV7-Jjzl--TBDfT-P_NxU_YLcCINMT11HAH03lqQ!/dl3/d3/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnZ3LzZfNktDM0pVRDQwMERPRjBJR1ZBRUFQMUhBOTc!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=%2Fwps%2Fwcm%2Fconnect%2Fportaljalisco2009%2Fcontenidos%2Fgobierno+del+estado+jalisco%2Fjalisco%2Fpj_asfolklor%2Fpj_conthistomariachijalisco |archive-date=26 March 2012}}</ref> which has a Mariachi Festival in September.<ref name="khursh"/>
[[File:Mexican Folkloric Dancers of Jalisco.jpg|thumb|right|Dancers of [[Jarabe Tapatío]].]]
Other common folk music in the state is the [[jarabe]] and the [[son (music)|son]]. The jarabe is a type of music which began as a type of hymn especially to the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]]. During the [[Mexican War of Independence]], this style was adopted by the insurgents for secular music as well. Some example of famous traditional songs in this style include "Los Enanos", "El Gato", "El Palo" and "El Perico".  However, the most famous song is the "Jarabe Tapatío". The word ''jarabe'' is thought to come from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word "sharab" which means syrup or something sweet. The musical style has its roots in [[Andalucia]], Spain and was transplanted to Mexico.<ref name="atraccul"/> The jarabe is mostly associated with Jalisco but it is also popular in a number of other western states such as Nayarit, Colima and Guanajuato. Sones are particularly popular in the south of the state. Some traditional ones from Jalisco include El Son de la Madrugada, El Son de las Alanzas, El Son del la Negra and El Son de las Copetonas.<ref name="folklorico">{{cite web |url=http://www.folklorico.com/bailes/jalisco/sintesis-jalisco.html |title=Sones, Jarabes y Danzas |first=David |last=Rojas |publisher=Instituto Cultural "Raices Mexicanas" |language=es |trans-title=Sons, Jarabes and Dances |access-date=9 September 2011 |archive-date=12 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812003640/http://www.folklorico.com/bailes/jalisco/sintesis-jalisco.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Clothing and dance===
[[File:Mujer Mexicana con traje de Charro.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.8|Woman dressed in a [[Charro outfit]], originating in Jalisco.]]
The traditional ranch style clothing of Jalisco is an imitation of Spanish dress that the women of the court wore. The original was heavy in expensive lace and ribbons, but the Jalisco version focused on multicolored ribbons, as well as being made from cotton instead of silk and brocades. The popularity of this dress grew during the [[Mexican Revolution]] to various parts of the country, as it was worn by a number of famous female soldiers of the time. Today, it is considered one type of traditional Mexican dress, and is mostly worn for dancing to sons and jarabes. Another style of dress is the Jalisco ribbon dress, which consists of an ample skirt in a number of bright colors. The bottom ruffle generally measures up to {{Convert|35|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, onto which are placed ten strips of ribbons about {{Convert|1.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide in colors that contrast with that of the skirt. The blouse is usually of the same color as the skirt with sleeves extending to the elbows and also decorated with ribbons, especially around the collar. The ribbon dress and other type of folk dress are most often worn during traditional dances in special ceremonies.<ref name="folklorico"/>

There are many differences in traditional Mexican costumes based on the states or regions of the country of Mexico. Each state has a distinct style of dancing but most importantly way of dressing. The style of dress for Jalisco goes back to the mid-1800s up to the year 1910, and draws its inspiration from 20th century European fashion, mainly the French.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Volume One (2014) |url=https://www.locallearningnetwork.org/journal-of-folklore-and-education/current-and-past-issues/volume-one-2014/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515050628/https://www.locallearningnetwork.org/journal-of-folklore-and-education/current-and-past-issues/volume-one-2014/ |archive-date=15 May 2019 |access-date=2019-05-15 |website=Local Learning Network |language=en-US}}</ref> In Jalisco, the traditional dress is known as the [[Escaramuza charra|''escaramuza'']] dress, ''ranchera'' dress, or simply the ribbon dress.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jalisco Ribbon Dress {{!}} Costuming Across Borders |url=https://www.costumingacrossborders.com/jalisco-ribbon-dress#:~:text=The%20Jalisco%20ribbon%20dress,%20also,over-exaggerated%20to%20stunning%20effect. |access-date=2024-09-18 |website=Costumeacrossborders |language=en}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web |url=http://nationalclothing.org/america/21-mexico/18-traditional-mexican-costume-typical-pieces-of-clothing-in-mexico.html |title=Traditional Mexican costume.

The dress has a wide skirt designed to lift while dancing, as well as allowing for maximum movement. It has a very high neckline with long sleeves, all tiered with ruffles. For other touches of details the dress has embroidering details on the skirt, neckline, and top area of the dress. Accessories are also frequent additions. One of those accessories is the hairstyle, normally consisting of two braids adorned with bright ribbons. Another is the makeup, usually in bright colors to match the dress. Lastly, a major accessory which is also an important part of traditional dance are the heels worn. These heels make loud noise when they hit the ground, and often help provide the beat for dances.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Energy |first=Amigo |date=2023-06-09 |title=The History of Folklórico Dances in Mexico |url=https://amigoenergy.com/blog/the-history-of-folklorico-dances-in-mexico/ |access-date=2024-09-18 |website=Amigo Energy |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Tequila===
[[File:Campo y cerro.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Agave Landscape and Ancient Industrial Facilities of Tequila]] is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].]]
[[Tequila]] is a hard liquor which comes from a small region of Jalisco and which is made from the blue agave plant. It is the most famous type of [[mezcal]] produced in Mexico, and the only mezcal which is produced industrially with strict standards.  The tequila industry supports large scale cultivation of the blue agave, with about 200,000 people employed through it directly or indirectly. It is named after a small town northwest of the city of Guadalajara in the center of where it is produced and the native region of the blue agave. The plant was used in pre-Hispanic times to make a ceremonial drink. The Spanish used the sweet heart of the mature plant, called a piña (literally pineapple) to create a fermented and distilled beverage. The first person to have official permission to make and sell the liquor was José Antonio Cuervo in 1758. In 1888, the first license to export was given to the Sauza family. The drink's popularity rose with the introduction of the railroad, facilitating its shipping.  It comes in three styles, blanco (unaged), reposado (aged in oak barrels two months up to one year) and añejo which is aged in oak barrels for a minimum of one year and a maximum of three years. There is also extra anejo aged for a minimum of three years.<ref name="histeqgob">{{cite web |url=http://www.jalisco.gob.mx/wps/portal/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gzb2djr1AXEwMDF383A0_3MEdXxwBDD0dLc6B8pFm8T4iPh7FXkJGBv4mPsYGRm7-Po0uQqwEQENAdDrIPv36QvAEO4GiAV7-Jjzl--TBDfT-P_NxU_YLcCINMT11HAH03lqQ!/dl3/d3/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnZ3LzZfNktDM0pVRDQwMERPRjBJR1ZBRUFQMUhBOTc!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/portaljalisco2009/contenidos/gobierno+del+estado+jalisco/jalisco/pj_asfolklor/pj_conttequilajalisco |title=Historia del Tequila |author=Ricardo Ivo Ramirez Lamas |date=11 January 2011 |publisher=State of Jalisco |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=History of Tequila |access-date=9 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326180621/http://www.jalisco.gob.mx/wps/portal/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gzb2djr1AXEwMDF383A0_3MEdXxwBDD0dLc6B8pFm8T4iPh7FXkJGBv4mPsYGRm7-Po0uQqwEQENAdDrIPv36QvAEO4GiAV7-Jjzl--TBDfT-P_NxU_YLcCINMT11HAH03lqQ!/dl3/d3/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnZ3LzZfNktDM0pVRDQwMERPRjBJR1ZBRUFQMUhBOTc!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=%2Fwps%2Fwcm%2Fconnect%2Fportaljalisco2009%2Fcontenidos%2Fgobierno+del+estado+jalisco%2Fjalisco%2Fpj_asfolklor%2Fpj_conttequilajalisco |archive-date=26 March 2012}}</ref> In the year 2000 the [[National Museum of Tequila]], dedicated to the Tequila was inaugurated.

===Cuisine===
[[File:Birria de Chivo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Birria]], native to Jalisco, has become popular internationally with adaptations such as [[quesabirria]].]]
The pre-Hispanic cuisine of the state features: fish from the various lakes, birds including wild turkey often eaten with salsas made from a wide variety of ground or crushed chili peppers. The Spanish introduced European staples of bread, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, dairy products, rice and various fruits and vegetables. The European settlers quickly adopted local foodstuffs such as chili peppers and tomatoes to create hybrid dishes such as [[barbacoa]] and [[puchero]]. Accepting corn as a staple, the Spanish created today's enchiladas, quesadillas and gorditas. They also adopted pre-Hispanic [[tamale]]s, but these were significantly altered with the addition of large quantities of lard.<ref name="khursh"/> [[Tonalá, Jalisco|Tonalá]] is said to be the origin of [[pozole]], and it is claimed that the local Tonaltecas originally prepared it with human flesh as religious rite.<ref name="khursh"/>

===Catholic faith===
[[File:Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico (2021) - 024.jpg|thumb|right|[[Guadalajara Cathedral|Guadalajara Metropolitan Cathedral]]]]
Jalisco is home to three highly venerated images of the Virgin Mary which were created in the 16th century and referred to as "sisters." These are the images found in [[San Juan de los Lagos]], [[Zapopan]] and [[Talpa de Allende|Talpa]], with the first two the best known in Mexico.<ref name="vzapopan">{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2640-pilgrimage-with-la-virgen-de-zapopan-from-a-house-in-the-sun-by-dane-chandos |title=Pilgrimage with La Virgen de Zapopan from "A House in the Sun" |first=Dane |last=Chandos |date=4 February 2007 |publisher=Mexconnect |issn=1028-9089 |access-date=9 September 2011 |archive-date=23 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623213106/http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2640-pilgrimage-with-la-virgen-de-zapopan-from-a-house-in-the-sun-by-dane-chandos |url-status=live }}</ref>

The image at San Juan de Los Lagos has made this small town one of the most-visited pilgrimage sites in Mexico, receiving about seven million visitors each year from all parts of the country. While this image is most often referred to by the place name, she is also called by her native name ''Cihiuapilli'', which means "Great Lady." The church housing the image is filled with folk paintings called "[[ex voto]]s" or "retablos," which are created to petition the Virgin or to offer thanks for favors received.

This image of the Virgin Mary dates from the early 16th century and believed to have been brought to San Juan de Los Lagos by missionaries from [[Michoacán]]. The first major miracle attributed to the image occurred in 1623 when a child was revived after being accidentally stuck with spears. The first building dedicated to the image was constructed in 1643, but the current one was finished in 1779. In 1904, the pope granted permission to crown the image and the church received official cathedral status in 1972. [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the image in 1990.<ref name="rferguson"/>

The Virgin of Zapopan has her own basilica in the city of that name, but the image spends about half the year traveling to the various parishes of Guadalajara proper. According to legend, thunderstorms in the Guadalajara area were so strong that they killed church bell ringers. The origin of the image's yearly travels was a desire to protect these communities from destruction. Today, the Virgin of Zapopan still travels to the cathedral of Guadalajara every year to spend the rainy season there from June through September. While in Guadalajara, the image travels among the various churches there, accompanied by dancers, musicians and other faithful. In early October, the image is returned to the Zapopan basilica with much fanfare as a long procession in which the image is carried by foot.<ref name="vzapopan"/>
