Assam covers an area of {{convert|78438|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}. It is the second largest state in [[Northeast India|northeastern India]] by area and the largest in terms of population, with more than 31 million inhabitants. The state is bordered by [[Bhutan]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] to the north; [[Nagaland]] and [[Manipur]] to the east; [[Meghalaya]], [[Tripura]], [[Mizoram]] and [[Bangladesh]] to the south; and [[West Bengal]] to the west via the [[Siliguri Corridor]], a {{convert|22|km|mi|adj=mid|-wide}} strip of land that connects the state to the rest of India.

The [[Economy of Assam|Assamese economy]] is aided by [[wildlife tourism]] to [[Kaziranga National Park]] and [[Manas National Park]], which are [[World Heritage Site]]s. [[Dibru-Saikhowa National Park]] is famed for its [[feral horse]]s. [[Shorea robusta|Sal tree]] forests are found in the state which, as a result of abundant rainfall, look green all year round. Assam receives more rainfall than most parts of India; this rain feeds the [[Brahmaputra River]], whose [[Tributary|tributaries]] and [[oxbow lake]]s provide the region with a distinctive hydro-[[geomorphic]] environment.

== Etymology ==
{{main|Etymology of Assam}}
The first dated mention of the region comes from ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' (1st century) and [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]] (2nd century), which calls the region ''Kirrhadia'', apparently after the [[Kirata]] population.<ref>''Besatia'' in the Schoff translation and also sometimes used by Ptolemy, they are a people similar to Kirradai and they lived in the region between "Assam and Sichuan" {{harv|Casson|1989|pp=241–243}}</ref><ref>"The ''Periplus of the Erythraen Sea'' (last quarter of the first century A.D) and Ptolemy's ''Geography'' (middle of the second century A.D) appear to call the land including Assam Kirrhadia after its Kirata population." {{harvcol|Sircar|1990|pp=60–61}}</ref> In the classical period and up to the 12th century, the region east of the [[Karatoya river]], largely congruent to present-day Assam, was called [[Kamarupa]], and alternatively, [[Pragjyotisha]].<ref>"Prior to the thirteenth century the present region was called Kāmarūpa or, alternatively, Prāgjyotiṣapur", Lahiri, Nayanjot., ''Pre-Ahom Assam'' (Delhi 1991) p. 14</ref> Though a western portion of Assam as a region continued to be called [[Kamrup region|Kamrup]], the [[Ahom kingdom]] that emerged in the east, and which came to dominate the entire [[Brahmaputra valley]], was called Assam (e.g. Mughals used ''Asham''); and the [[Colonial Assam|British province]] too was called Assam.  Though the precise [[etymology of Assam]] is not clear, the name Assam is associated with the [[Ahom people]], originally called ''Shyam'' ([[Shan people|Shan]]).<ref>"Ahoms also gave Assam and its language their name (''Ahom'' and the modern ''ɒχɒm'' 'Assam' come from an attested earlier form ''asam'', ''acam'', probably from a Burmese corruption of the word ''Shan/Shyam'', cf. ''Siam'': Kakati 1962; 1-4)." {{harv|Masica|1993|p=50}}</ref>

=== Pre-history ===
{{further|People of Assam}}
Assam and adjoining regions have evidences of human settlement from the beginning of the [[Stone Age]]. The hills at the height of 1,500 to 2,000 feet (460–615&nbsp;m) were popular habitats probably due to availability of exposed dolerite basalt, useful for tool-making.<ref name="HKBarpujariCHOA">{{Citation |last=Sircar |first=D C |contribution=Pragjyotisha-Kamarupa |year=1990 |title=The Comprehensive History of Assam| editor-last = Barpujari| editor-first = H K |volume=I |pages=59–78 |place=Guwahati |publisher=Publication Board, Assam}}</ref>

=== Legend ===
{{further|Danava dynasty|Bhauma dynasty|Asura kingdom}}
According to a late text, [[Kalika Purana]] (c. 9th–10th century [[Common Era|CE]]), the earliest ruler of Assam was Mahiranga Danav of the [[Danava dynasty]], which was removed by [[Narakasura|Naraka]] of [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] and established the [[Bhauma dynasty]]. The last of these rulers, also Naraka, was slain by [[Krishna]].  Naraka's son [[Bhagadatta]] became the king, who (it is mentioned in the Mahabharata) fought for the [[Kaurava]]s in the [[Kurukshetra War|battle of Kurukshetra]] with an army of [[kiratas]], [[chinas]] and dwellers of the eastern coast. At the same time towards the east in central Assam, [[Asura kingdom]] was ruled by another line of kings.<ref>India History Association. Session (2001), ''Proceedings of North East India History Association North East'' he came under the 'bad' influence of Banasura, ruler of Sonitapura (identified with Tezpur now under Sonitpur district in central Assam), and ended up sidelining Kamakhya in favour of Siva. Thereafter Naraka forsook the guidance</ref>

All three dynasties claimed descent from [[Narakasura]]. In the reign of the Varman king, [[Bhaskaravarman]] (c. 600–650 CE), the Chinese traveller [[Xuanzang]] visited the [[Kamrup region|region]] and recorded his travels. Later, after weakening and disintegration (after the Kamarupa-Palas), the Kamarupa tradition was extended to c. 1255 CE by the Lunar I (c. 1120–1185 CE) and Lunar II (c. 1155–1255 CE) dynasties.<ref name="HKBarpujariCHOA" />

=== Medieval era ===
{{further|Kamata kingdom|Koch dynasty|Ahom kingdom|Chutia kingdom|Kachari kingdom|Baro-Bhuyan}}

The Medieval Assam history may have started with the advent of [[Ahom kingdom|Ahoms]] in the early part of the 13th century and covers their entire rule of 600 years till 1826. The medieval history of Assam is especially known for its conflict with Muslim powers under [[Turko-Afghan]] and [[Mughals]], finally resulting in Assamese victory, however, this military glory was shattered in the early 19th century when it failed to resist the [[Burmese invasions of Assam|Burmese invasions]], which led to its annexation.<ref>{{harvcol|Baruah|1986|p=36}}</ref>

===Chutia kingdom===

[[Chutia kingdom|Chutia]], a [[Bodo-Kachari people|Bodo-Kachari]] group by origin, held the regions on both the banks of Brahmaputra with its domain in the area eastwards from [[Biswanath Chariali|Vishwanath]] (north bank) and [[Dihing River|Buridihing]] (south bank), in [[Upper Assam]] and in the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. It was annexed by the Ahoms in the year 1524. The rivalry between the Chutias and Ahoms for the supremacy of eastern Assam led to a series of conflicts between them from the early 16th century.

===Kachari kingdom===
{{Main|Kachari kingdom}}

The [[Kachari kingdom|Dimasa]], another [[Bodo-Kachari people|Bodo-Kachari]] dynasty, (13th century–1854) ruled from [[Dikhow River]] to central and southern Assam and had their capital at [[Dimapur]]. With the expansion of Ahom kingdom, by the early 17th century, the Chutia areas were annexed and since c. 1536 the Kacharis remained only in [[Cachar]] and [[North Cachar]], and more as an Ahom ally than a competing force.

=== Ahom kingdom ===

=== Early period ===
{{Main|Sukaphaa}}
The [[Ahom people|Ahoms]], a [[Tai peoples|Tai]] group, ruled [[Upper Assam]] for almost 600 years.<ref>Banikanta Kakati, ''Assamese:Its formation and development''</ref> In the year 1228 the Tai-Ahoms came to the [[Brahmaputra Valley]] under the leadership of [[Sukaphaa|Sukapha]] along with 9,000 men from [[Mong Mao]], a Tai state, situated in South-Western [[Yunnan]] of China, and established his kingdom in [[Upper Assam]]. In 1253, he founded the capital city in a hillock and named it [[Charaideo]]. At the time of his advent, the area was inhabited by [[Moran people|Moran]]s and Borahis, to the north, to the north-east was the [[Chutia kingdom]] and to the south was the [[Kachari kingdom]] and to the west on the plains were the [[Baro-Bhuyan#Baro-Bhuyans of Assam|Baro-Bhuyans]].

For more than two and a half centuries, Sukapha and his descendants, while primarily focused on administering the kingdom, upheld their dominance in the valley through their military prowess.<ref>{{Harvcol|Baruah|1986|pp=220–224}}</ref>

==== Expansion ====
{{Main|Suhungmung|Dimasa kingdom}}
[[File:Sketch map illustrating the extent of the Assamese kingdom in their zenith.png|thumb|Assamese kingdoms in their greatest territorial heights. [[Kachari kingdom]] (1230) in red dotted lines, [[Koch dynasty]] (1560) in blue lines, [[Ahom kingdom]] (1700) in red lines.]]
The reign of [[Suhungmung]] marked the first massive expansion of [[Ahom kingdom]]. Besides sending a punitive expeditions against the Nagas, they fought numerous battles with the Bhuyans, Chutias, Kacharis,  Turko-Afghans, and the Naras. In 1522-23 the [[Chutia kingdom]] was annexed and the captured tract was placed under the administration of Sadiya-Khowa-Gohain. After securing the eastern tract, Suhungmung than expanded his kingdom westwards through conquest and extended it till Marangi to the west of the [[Dhansiri]] river. When the Kacharis tried to regain the lost territory they were defeated and their capital [[Dimapur]] was sacked. Over the remaining part of the Kachari kingdom, a new king Detsung was placed as a tributary, but Detsung proved disloyal and revolted against the Ahoms. He was subsequently executed. A new dependent king was set up on the Kachari throne with the name of Nirbhaynarayan. Since then the Kachari kings were regarded as 'thapita sanchita' meaning - established and maintained by the Ahom rulers.

Suhungmung's reign also witnessed the first Muslim-invasions of the kingdom. After a series of battle, the invaders were roundly defeated and were chased up to [[Karatoya River]]. The Sultan of Bengal, terrified by the approaching army of Suhungmung, made peace by offering his two daughters and five paraganas, along with other articles as dowry to the king. The rising Koch king [[Biswa Singha]] also offered his submission, and the Ahom general Ton-Kham granted him all the territories that were received as dowry from the Sultan of Bengal on the condition of annual tribute.<ref>{{Harvcol|Baruah|1986|pp=224–234}}</ref>

The successors of Suhungmung, [[Suklenmung]] and [[Sukhaamphaa]], sent many expeditions against the Bhuyans and Nagas. But were significant with the wars with the Koch. During the reign of [[Sukhaamphaa]], the Ahoms lost to a Koch army led by [[Chilarai]] and the Ahoms had to accept Koch supremacy and had to give up the tracts of north of Brahmaputra. However, the lost tract was soon recovered with further military expeditions.<ref>{{Harvcol|Gogoi|2017|pp=1–17}}</ref>

Soon after the death of [[Nara Narayan]] his kingdom, got divided between the sons of Nara Narayan and [[Chilarai]] as [[Koch Hajo]] and [[Koch Bihar]]. In 1609, Laxmi Narayan king of [[Cooch Behar]] accepted the vassalage of [[Mughals]], and the [[Koch Hajo]] king Raghudev and later his son Parikshit sought assistance from Ahoms. In 1612, the [[Mughals]] attacked [[Koch Hajo]] and his territory up to [[Barnadi River]] were annexed in the Mughal domain. This brought the Mughals with direct contact with Ahoms. Meanwhile, Parikshit was trying to renew his friendship with Ahoms, but got captured, and died on his way to his kingdom. Later [[Balinarayan]], a brother of Parikshit who had taken refugee under the Ahoms was made the king of Darrang in 1615 by the Ahom king [[Susenghphaa|Pratap Singha]]. From 1616, onwards many battles were fought the Mughal without any tangible result, with the first [[Battle of Samdhara]] till after the last battle where the treaty was concluded in 1639 which fixed the Asurar ali on the south bank and the Barnadi on the north bank of the Brahmaputra as the boundary between the two.
Pratap Singha had also enacted the [[Paik system]] and created a number of army and civil administration posts such as the [[Borbarua]] and [[Borphukan]].
[[File:Garh Garhchuck.jpg|thumb|213x213px|[[Garchuk Lachit Garh]] a 17th-century mud fort ruins|left]]
[[Jayadhwaj Singha]] taking the advantage of [[War of succession]] between the sons of [[Shah Jahan]], occupied the imperial territories up to [[Dhaka]]. [[Aurangzeb]] after becoming the emperor, appointed [[Mir Jumla II]], to recover the lost territory. After fail negotiations. In November 1661, Mir Jumla proceeded with a huge army and fleet to invade Ahom kingdom. Here the Ahoms, lost at several places, and then captured the Ahom capital [[Garhgaon]]. During the rainy season Mir Jumla and his army suffered immeasurable hardship due to the climatic condition of the valley in addition the guerrilla fighting resorted against the invaders. And at last no noticeable gain, negotiation started and in January 1663, [[Treaty of Ghilajharighat]] was concluded. According to the treaty, the Ahoms had to acknowledging Mughal supremacy, ceded the territory west of the Bharali on the north bank and the Kalang on the south bank along with a huge amount of war indemnity and handing over the sons of the Gohains as hostage and two Ahom princesses to the Mughal harem.

Soon after the departure of [[Mir Jumla II|Mir Jumla]], [[Jayadhwaj Singha]] died and the new king [[Chakradhwaj Singha]] began preparations to overthrow Mughal supremacy and to recover the lost territory. After numerous battles, finally after the [[Battle of Saraighat]] the Mughals were forced to retreat.

The period after 1671 was very unstable due to the rivalry among the nobles, who wanted to arrest their own political power and influence by placing their own choice of prince in the throne. In 1679, [[Laluksola Borphukan]], in hopes of becoming king with the help of Mughals, surrendered Guwahati without any battle. But after the accession of [[Gadadhar Singha]], fought the final [[Battle of Itakhuli]] where the Mughals were badly defeated. And the since then the border was fixed at Manah on the north bank and the Nagarbera hill on the south bank of the Brahmaputra till its annexation by the [[East India Company]] in 1826.<ref>"In the Battle of Itakhuli in September 1682, the Ahom forces chased the defeated Mughals nearly one hundred kilometers back to the Manas river. The Manas then became the Ahom-Mughal boundary until the British occupation." {{cite book |last=Richards |first=John F. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC |title=The Mughal Empire |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1995 |isbn=0521566037 |location=Cambridge |page=247 |access-date=26 January 2013 |archive-date=1 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230201230334/https://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Harvcol|Gogoi|2017|pp=17–20}}</ref>

[[File:Assamese royal court scene from Dharma Purana.jpg|left|thumb|Royal court of [[Siva Singha]] and [[Ambika, Bar Raja|Ambika]] by Badha Ligira, {{Circa|1736}}.]]
[[Rudra Singha]] succeeded [[Gadadhar Singha]], his reign is notable because of his military achievements and his socio-culture contributions. He had both subjugated the Kachari and Jaintia kingdoms, and had captured their kings and forced to accept Ahom suzerainty and agreed them to pay annual tribute. Other than that, several expeditions were sent against the Miris, the Daflas, the Naga Mishmis and the Nagas of Namsung, Dayang and the Rengma Nagas during late 17th century and early 18th century. Rudra Singha had made extensive preparations for his invasion of Bengal but remained unfulfilled due to his sudden death in 1714.

After [[Rudra Singha]], the Ahoms achieved no notable military achievement. During this period from, [[Siva Singha]] to [[Rajeswar Singha]], the kingdom witnessed peace and prosperity and was significant for constructive activities and other development. In the field of religion also, [[Ekasarana Dharma]] spread all over the kingdom and started to influence all aspects of people's life. The religious heads of Vaisnavite monastery exalted great influence with royal patronage and established numerous [[Satras]] and most of the people became their disciples. So got the Ahom court greatly came under the influence of Sakta Brahman priests and astrologers. The religious policies concluded by [[Phuleshwari]] and the persecutions of unfavored Satras, embroiled the situation more along with the pressure of [[Paik system]] in the 18th century.<ref>{{Harvcol|Gogoi|2017|pp=20–26}}</ref>

This finally resulted in the [[Moamoria rebellion]] (1769–1805), which greatly weakened the [[Ahom kingdom]] where the country was greatly depopulated and unorganised. The political rivalry between the nobles made a pathway for the Burmese to invade and weakened it more and finally leading to its annexation.

=== Colonial era ===

The discovery of ''[[Camellia sinensis]]'' in 1834 in Assam was followed by testing in 1836–37 in London. The British allowed companies to rent land from 1839 onwards. Thereafter tea plantations proliferated in Eastern Assam,<ref name=Roy>{{cite book |last=Roy |first=Tirthankar |title=India in the World Economy: From Antiquity to the Present |year=2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-00910-3 |page=202}}</ref> where the soil and the climate were most suitable. Problems with the imported Han Chinese labourers from China and hostility from native Assamese resulted in the migration of forced labourers from central and eastern parts of India. After initial trial and error with planting the Chinese and the Assamese-Chinese hybrid varieties, the planters later accepted the local ''[[Camellia assamica]]'' as the most suitable variety for Assam. By the 1850s, the industry started seeing some profits. The industry saw initial growth, when in 1861, investors were allowed to own land in Assam and it saw substantial progress with the invention of new technologies and machinery for preparing processed tea during the 1870s.

Despite the commercial success, tea labourers continued to be exploited, working and living under poor conditions. Fearful of greater government interference, the tea growers formed the [[Indian Tea Association]] in 1888 to lobby to retain the status quo. The organisation was successful in this, but even after India's independence, conditions of the labourers have improved very little.<ref>{{Citation |last1=MacFarlane |first1=Alan |last2=MacFarlane |first2=Iris |title=Green Gold, The Empire of Tea, Ch. 6–11 |publisher=Random House, London |year=2003}}</ref>

In the later part of the 18th century, religious tensions and atrocities by the nobles led to the [[Moamoria rebellion]] (1769–1805), resulting in tremendous casualties of lives and property. The rebellion was suppressed but the kingdom was severely weakened by the civil war. Political rivalry between Prime Minister Purnananda [[Burhagohain]] and Badan Chandra [[Borphukan]], the [[Ahom people|Ahom]] Viceroy of Western Assam, led to an invitation to the Burmese by the latter,<ref>Gait E.A.

The arrangement lasted until 1838 and thereafter the British gradually annexed the entire region. Thereafter the court language and medium of instruction in educational institutions of Assam was made [[Bengali language|Bengali]], instead of Assamese. Starting from 1836 until 1873, this imposition of a foreign tongue created greater unemployment among the [[People of Assam]] and Assamese literature naturally suffered in its growth.<ref>{{Cite book |title=North-East India, Problem Prospect and Politics |last=Barpujari |first=H.K. |publisher=Spectrum Publishers. |year=1998 |location=Guwahati |page=41}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Social History of Assam |last=Bose |first=M.L. |publisher=Ashok Kumar Mittal Concept Publishing Company |year=1989 |location=New Delhi |page=91}}</ref>

Initially, Assam was made a part of the [[Bengal Presidency]], then in 1906 it was made a part of [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]] province, and in 1912 it was reconstituted into a chief commissioners' province. In 1913, a legislative council and, in 1937, the Assam Legislative Assembly, were formed in Shillong, the erstwhile capital of the region. The British tea planters imported labour from central India adding to the demographic canvas.

The Assam territory was first separated from Bengal in 1874 as the 'North-East Frontier' [[non-regulation province]], also known as the Assam Chief-Commissionership. It was incorporated into the new province of [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]] in 1905 after the partition of Bengal (1905–1911) and re-established in 1912 as [[Assam Province]].<ref>[[William Cooke Taylor]], ''A Popular History of British India.'' p. 505</ref>

After a few initially unsuccessful attempts to gain independence for Assam during the 1850s, anti-colonial Assamese joined and actively supported the [[Indian National Congress]] against the British from the early 20th century, with [[Gopinath Bordoloi]] emerging as the preeminent nationalist leader in the Assam Congress.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} Bordoloi's major political rival in this time was Sir Saidullah, who was representing the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]], and had the backing of the influential Muslim cleric [[Maulana Bhasani]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/publication/faultlines/volume13/Article2.htm |title=The Secessionist Insurgency and the Freedom of Minds |last1=Nath |first1=Sunil |year=2001 |website=www.satp.org |publisher=Institute for Conflict Management|access-date= 24 January 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180417020155/http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/publication/faultlines/volume13/Article2.htm|archive-date= 17 April 2018|url-status=live }}</ref>

The ''Assam Postage Circle'' was established by 1873 under the headship of the Deputy Post Master General.<ref>{{cite web |author=Indian Philatelists Forum |url=http://modernindianphilately.blogspot.in/2011/06/indian-postal-circles.html |title=Glimpses of Modern Indian Philately: INDIAN POSTAL CIRCLES |publisher=Modernindianphilately.blogspot.in |date=4 June 2011 |access-date=11 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508223652/http://modernindianphilately.blogspot.in/2011/06/indian-postal-circles.html |archive-date=8 May 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

At the turn of the 20th century, British India consisted of eight provinces that were administered either by a governor or a lieutenant-governor. Assam Province was one among the major eight provinces of British India. The table below shows the major original provinces during British India covering the Assam Province under the Administrative Office of the Chief Commissioner.

With the partition of India in 1947, Assam became a constituent state of India. The [[Sylhet District]] of Assam (excluding the Karimganj subdivision) was given up to East Pakistan, which later became Bangladesh.

The government of India, which has the unilateral powers to change the borders of a state, divided Assam into several states beginning in 1970 within the borders of what was then Assam. In 1963, the Naga Hills district became the 16th state of India under the name of [[Nagaland]]. Part of Tuensang was added to Nagaland. In 1970, in response to the demands of the Khasi, Jaintia and Garo people of the [[Karbi-Meghalaya plateau|Meghalaya Plateau]], the districts containing the Khasi Hills, Jaintia Hills, and Garo Hills were formed into an autonomous state within Assam; in 1972 this became a separate state under the name of Meghalaya. In 1972, Arunachal Pradesh (the [[North East Frontier Agency]]) and Mizoram (from the Mizo Hills in the south) were separated from Assam as union territories; both became states in 1986.<ref name="Bhattacharyya1995">{{cite book |author=Bhubaneswar Bhattacharyya |title=The troubled border: some facts about boundary disputes between Assam-Nagaland, Assam-Arunachal Pradesh, Assam-Meghalaya, and Assam-Mizoram |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sktuAAAAMAAJ |year=1995 |publisher=Lawyer's Book Stall |isbn=9788173310997}}</ref>

Since the restructuring of Assam after independence, communal tensions and violence remain. [[Assam separatist movements|Separatist groups]] began forming along ethnic lines, and demands for autonomy and sovereignty grew, resulting in the fragmentation of Assam. In 1961, the government of Assam passed legislation making use of the [[Assamese language]] compulsory. It was withdrawn later [[Bengali Language Movement (Barak Valley)|under pressure from Bengali speaking people in Cachar]]. In the 1980s the Brahmaputra valley saw a six-year [[Assam Agitation]]<ref name="Hazarika">{{Citation |first=Sanjoy |last=Hazarika |title=Strangers of the Mist |publisher=Penguin Books Australia Ltd. |year=2003 |isbn=0-14-024052-7}}</ref> triggered by the discovery of a sudden rise in registered voters on electoral rolls. It tried to force the government to identify and deport foreigners illegally migrating from neighbouring [[Bangladesh]] and to provide constitutional, legislative, administrative and cultural safeguards for the indigenous Assamese majority, which they felt was under threat due to the increase of migration from Bangladesh. The agitation ended after an accord (Assam Accord 1985) between its leaders and the Union Government, which remained unimplemented, causing simmering discontent.<ref name="SinhaSKillmig">{{cite web |author=Governor of Assam |title=Report on Illegal Migration into Assam |date=8 November 1998 |url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/assam/documents/papers/illegal_migration_in_assam.htm| access-date =26 May 2007 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070609170339/http://satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/assam/documents/papers/illegal_migration_in_assam.htm| archive-date= 9 June 2007 | url-status=live}}</ref>

The post 1970s experienced the growth of armed separatist groups such as the [[United Liberation Front of Asom]] (ULFA)<ref name="Hazarika" /> and the [[National Democratic Front of Bodoland]] (NDFB). In November 1990, the [[Government of India]] deployed the [[Indian army]], after which low-intensity military conflicts and political homicides have been continuing for more than a decade. In recent times, ethnically based militant groups have grown. The [[Panchayati Raj]] Act has been applied in Assam, after agitation of the communities due to the sluggish rate of development and general apathy of successive state governments towards Indigenous Assamese communities.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

A significant geographical aspect of Assam is that it contains three of six physiographic divisions of India – The Northern Himalayas (Eastern Hills), The Northern Plains (Brahmaputra plain) and Deccan Plateau (Karbi Anglong). As the Brahmaputra flows in Assam the climate here is cold and there is rainfall most of the month. Geomorphic studies conclude that the Brahmaputra, the life-line of Assam, is an [[antecedent river]] older than the Himalayas, which has [[Entrenched river|entrenched itself]] since they started rising. The river with steep [[Canyon|gorges]] and rapids in Arunachal Pradesh entering Assam, becomes a [[braided river]] (at times 10&nbsp;mi/16&nbsp;km wide) and with tributaries, creates a flood plain (Brahmaputra Valley: 50–60&nbsp;mi/80–100&nbsp;km wide, 600&nbsp;mi/1000&nbsp;km long).<ref name="RLSinghIndia">{{Citation |first=R.

=== Climate ===
With the [[tropical monsoon climate]], Assam is temperate (summer max. at 95–100&nbsp;°F or 35–38&nbsp;°C and winter min. at 43–46&nbsp;°F or 6–8&nbsp;°C) and experiences heavy rainfall and high humidity.<ref name="RLSinghIndia" /><ref>{{cite web |last=Purdue University |title=The Köppen Classification of Climates |url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/tropical/lecture_04/lec_04.html |access-date  = 25 May 2007|archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070605020325/http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/tropical/lecture_04/lec_04.html |archive-date = 5 June 2007|url-status  = dead }}</ref> The climate is characterised by heavy monsoon downpours reducing summer temperatures and affecting foggy nights and mornings in winters, frequent during the afternoons. Spring (March–April) and autumn (September–October) are usually pleasant with moderate rainfall and temperature. Assam's agriculture usually depends on the south-west monsoon rains.

Every year, flooding from the Brahmaputra and other rivers such as Barak River etc. deluges places in Assam. The water levels of the rivers rise because of rainfall resulting in the rivers overflowing their banks and engulfing nearby areas.

The population of the Brahmaputra Valley is 27,580,977 according to the 2011 census report by the Assam government. Assamese is the official language of the Brahmaputra Valley and is spoken by 15 million people comprising 55.65% of the valley population. Bengali is spoken by 6.09 million people representing 22.1% of the valley, Hindi is spoken by 2.1 million comprising 7.61% of the region, Bodo is spoken by 1.41 million comprising 5.13% of the valley's population and 2.98 million people speak various indigenous tribal languages of Assam, such as [[Karbi people|Karbi]], [[Tiwa (Lalung)]], [[Hmar people|Hmar]], [[Deori people|Deori]], [[Rabha people|Rabha]], [[Mising people|Mishing]], [[Koch people|Koch]], [[Rajbongshi people|Rajbangshi]], [[Garo people|Garo]], [[Dimasa people|Dimasa]], [[Indian Gorkha|Gorkha]], Halam, Ao and Motak.

Traditionally, Assamese was the language of the common folk in the ancient [[Kamarupa kingdom]] and in the medieval kingdoms of [[Kachari kingdom|Dimasa Kachari]], [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutiya Kachari]], Borahi Kachari, [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom]] and [[Kamata kingdom|Kamata]] kingdoms. Traces of the language are found in many poems by Luipa, Sarahapa, and others, in [[Charyapada]] (c. 7th–8th century CE). Modern dialects such as [[Kamrupi dialects|Kamrupi]] and [[Goalpariya dialects|Goalpariya]] are remnants of this language, which blend into the [[Rajbanshi language (Nepal)|Rajbanshi]] and [[Rangpuri language|Rangpuri]] lects spoken in North Bengal which have the same origin. Moreover, Assamese in its traditional form was used by the ethno-cultural groups in the region as lingua-franca, which spread during the stronger kingdoms and was required for economic integration. Localised forms of the language still exist in Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.

Linguistically modern Assamese traces its roots to the version developed by the American Missionaries based on the local form used near [[Sivasagar]] (Xiwôxagôr) district. Assamese (''Ôxômiya'') is a rich language due to its hybrid nature and unique characteristics of pronunciation and softness. The presence of [[Voiceless velar fricative]] in Assamese makes it a unique among other similar [[Indo-Aryan languages]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Das |first1=Ankur |last2=Deka |first2=Tusmita |title=The Allophonic Variation of the Assamese voiceless velar fricative /x/ |journal=13th Annual Conference of South Asian Languages (ICOSAL13) |url=https://www.academia.edu/35777293 |access-date=21 July 2019 |archive-date=16 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220416085609/https://www.academia.edu/35777293 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.languagesgulper.com/eng/Assamese.html |title=Assamese |website=www.languagesgulper.com |access-date=21 July 2019 |archive-date=6 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191206071325/http://www.languagesgulper.com/eng/Assamese.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Boro language (India)|Bodo]] is spoken largely in [[Western Assam]]. It is official language of the [[Bodoland Territorial Region|Bodoland]] territorial region and co-official language of the state of Assam. It is also one of twenty-two languages listed in the Eighth Schedule of the [[Constitution of India]]. Spatial distribution patterns of the ethno-cultural groups, cultural traits and the phenomenon of naming all the major rivers in the [[North-East India|North East Region]] with Bodo-Kachari words (e.g. [[Dihing]], Dibru, [[Dihong]], D/[[Teesta River|Tista]], and Dikrai) reveal that it was more widely-spoken in ancient times. Other languages of Tibeto-Burman origin and related to Bodo-Kachari are [[Deori language|Deori]], [[Mising language|Mising]], [[Karbi language|Karbi]], [[Rabha language|Rabha]], and [[Tiwa (Lalung)|Tiwa]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

There are approximately 590,000 [[Nepali language|Nepali]] speakers spread all over the state forming about 1.98% of Assam's total population according to 2011 census.

There are speakers of [[Tai languages]] in Assam. A total of six Tai languages were spoken in Assam. Two are now extinct.<ref name="Morey">Morey, Stephen. 2005. ''The Tai languages of Assam: a grammar and texts''. Canberra: Pacific Linguistics.</ref>

On 31 December 2022, existing four districts Bajali (with Barpeta), Tamulpur(with Udalguri), Biswanath (with Sonitpur) and Hojai(with Nagaon) and number of district came down to 31.

However, after the delimitation exercise was carried out in Assam, the [[Assam Cabinet]] reconstituted the 4 new districts (Bajali, Tamulpur, Biswanath and Hojai), taking the number of districts to 35 again.

=== Subdivisions ===
The administrative districts are further subdivided into 54 "Subdivisions" or ''[[Mahakuma]]''.<ref name="RDGoA" /> Every district is administered from a district headquarters with the office of the [[District Collector|Deputy Commissioner]], District Magistrate, Office of the District Panchayat and usually with a [[District Courts of India|district court]].

The [[Local Governance in India|local governance]] system is organised under the ''jila-parishad'' (District Panchayat) for a district, ''[[Panchayati Raj|panchayat]]'' for group of or individual rural areas and under the urban local bodies for the towns and cities. There are now 2489 village panchayats covering 26247 villages in Assam.<ref name="DIPRGoA">{{cite web |last=Directorate of Information and Public Relations |first=Government of Assam |title=Area of the National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries in Assam, 2002 |url=http://janasanyogassam.nic.in/assamataglance.htm |access-date=29 May 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006161204/http://janasanyogassam.nic.in/assamataglance.htm |archive-date=6 October 2007}}</ref> The 'town-committee' or ''nagar-somiti'' for small towns, 'municipal board' or ''pouro-sobha'' for medium towns and [[municipal corporation]] or ''pouro-nigom'' for the cities consist of the urban local bodies.

For revenue purposes, the districts are divided into revenue circles and ''mouza''s; for the development projects, the districts are divided into 219 'development-blocks' and for law and order these are divided into 206 police stations or ''thana''.

[[Guwahati]] is the largest [[metropolitan area]] and [[urban conglomeration]] administered under the highest form of [[urban local body]] – [[Guwahati Municipal Corporation]] in Assam. The Corporation administers an area of {{cvt|216.79|km2}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gmcportal.in/gmc-web/ |title=GMC Portal|access-date=5 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805090715/http://www.gmcportal.in/gmc-web/|archive-date=5 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Apart from [[Guwahati Municipal Corporation]] and [[Dibrugarh Municipal Corporation]] All other urban centres are managed under [[Nagar Palika|Municipal Boards]].

'''Assam-Mizoram dispute'''

[[Mizoram]] used to be a district of Assam as [[Lushai hills]] before being carved out as a separate union territory and later, becoming another state in 1987. Because of the history, the district's borders did not really matter for locals for a long time. Mizoram shares a border with the districts [[Cachar]], [[Hailakandi]] and [[Karimganj]] which comes under [[Barak valley]] region of Assam.
Over time, the two states started having different perceptions about where the demarcation should be. While Mizoram wants it to be along an [[Inner Line Permit]] notified in 1875 to protect tribals from outside influence, which Mizos feel is part of their historical homeland, Assam wants it to be demarcated according to district boundaries drawn up much later.<ref name="The Times of India"/><ref>{{cite news |last1=Deb |first1=Debraj |title=Explained: Why did a 150-year-old Assam-Mizoram dispute get violent now? |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/the-assam-mizoram-dispute-violence-policemen-dead-7425600/ |access-date=25 May 2022 |work=The Indian Express |date=5 August 2021 |language=en |archive-date=3 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220403085429/https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/the-assam-mizoram-dispute-violence-policemen-dead-7425600/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

'''Assam-Meghalaya dispute'''

[[Meghalaya]] has identified close to a dozen areas on which it has a dispute with Assam about the state's borders. The chief ministers of the two states, [[Himanta Biswa Sarma]] and Megahalya's [[Conrad Sangma]], recently held the first-ever meeting on inter-state border dispute. Both the states have agreed to individually assess the claims for all 12 areas flagged by Meghalaya in the past. A second round of discussion between the two state CMs will be held next month of August.
On the question of the role the Union Government is playing in redressing the inter-State border dispute in the country, minister of state for home affairs [[Nityanand Rai]] said, "The approach of the Central Government has consistently been that inter-state disputes can be resolved only with the cooperation of the State Governments concerned and that the Central Government acts only as a facilitator for amicable settlement of the dispute in the spirit of mutual understanding."<ref name="The Times of India"/>
 
'''Assam-Nagaland dispute'''

The border dispute between the two states has been going on since the formation of Nagaland in 1963. The two states lay claim to Merapani, a small village next to the plains of Assam's Golaghat district. There have been reports of violent clashes in the region since the 1960s.<ref name="The Times of India"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/border-dispute-assam-signs-agreement-with-nagaland-to-diffuse-stand-off-on-eastern-front/articleshow/84925132.cms |title=Assam Nagaland border dispute: Assam signs agreement with Nagaland to diffuse stand-off on eastern front   |website=[[The Times of India]] |date=August 2021 |access-date=14 August 2021 |archive-date=1 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230201230330/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/border-dispute-assam-signs-agreement-with-nagaland-to-diffuse-stand-off-on-eastern-front/articleshow/84925132.cms |url-status=live }}</ref>

'''Assam-Arunachal Pradesh dispute'''

Assam shares an 804.10&nbsp;km inter-state boundary with [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. The state of Arunachal Pradesh, created in 1987, claims some land that traditionally belonged to its residents has been given to Assam. A tripartite committee had recommended that certain territories be transferred from Assam to Arunachal. The two states have since been battling it out in the [[Supreme court of India]] over the issue. Some incidents of local violence have been reported from the borders.<ref name="The Times of India"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Border dispute with Arunachal at 1,200 places: Himanta Biswa Sarma |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/border-dispute-with-arunachal-at-1200-places-himanta-biswa-sarma/article61430562.ece |access-date=25 May 2022 |work=The Hindu |date=13 August 2021 |language=en-IN |archive-date=25 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220525120742/https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/border-dispute-with-arunachal-at-1200-places-himanta-biswa-sarma/article61430562.ece |url-status=live }}</ref>

'''Dimaraji'''
{{Main article|Dimaraji}}

[[File:Dimaraji map.jpeg|thumb|200px|Map of Dimaraji state]]

The [[Dimasa people]] of northeast India have been demanding a separate state called [[Dimaraji]] or "Dimaland" for several decades. It would comprise the [[Dimasa people|Dimasa]]-[[Dimasa people|Kachari]] inhabited areas, namely [[Dima Hasao district]], [[Cachar district]], parts of [[Nagaon district|Barak Valley, Nagaon district]], [[Hojai district]] and [[Karbi Anglong district]] in Assam together with part of [[Dimapur district]] in [[Nagaland]].

'''Karbiland'''
{{See also|Karbi Anglong}}
[[File:Dima_Hasao_und_Karbi_Anglong_Distrikte.svg|alt=|left|frameless|327x327px]]

[[Karbi Anglong]] is one of the 35 [[List of districts of Assam|districts]] of Assam. Karbi Anglong was previously known as Mikir Hills. It was part of the Excluded Areas and Partially Excluded Areas (the present North East India) in British India. The British Indian government had never included this area under their government's jurisdiction. Thereby, no government development work or activity were done, nor any tax levied from the hills including Karbi Anglong. The first memorandum for a [[Karbi people|Karbi]] homeland was presented to Governor Reid on 28 October 1940 by [[Semsonsing Ingti]] and Khorsing Terang at Mohongdijua.<ref>Dharamsing Teron, "Opium Curse – A Forgotten Chapter", unpublished.</ref> The Karbi leaders were then, a part of the All Party Hill Leaders' Conference (APHLC) which was formed on 6 July 1960.<ref>J.

Then again from 1986 through the leadership of Autonomous State Demand Committee (ASDC), demanded Autonomous statehood of Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao under Article 244(A). In 2002, the Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council passed another resolution to press for the demand of statehood. Several other memoranda were submitted at different times by several organisations. The demand for a separate state turned violent on 31 July 2013 when student demonstrators set government buildings on fire. Following the incident, the elected leaders of Karbi Anglong jointly submitted a memorandum to the [[Prime Minister of India]] demanding a separate State. Demographic wise, more than half of the Karbi Anglong population is made up of Indigenous Karbi tribe with significant migrants from other parts of India.<ref name="censusindia.gov.in"/>

===Migration from Bangladesh===
Assam has been a major site of migration since the [[Partition of India|Partition]] of the subcontinent, with the first wave being composed largely of [[Bengali Hindu]] [[East Bengali refugees|refugees]] arriving during and shortly after the establishment of India and Pakistan (current day Bangladesh was originally part of Pakistan, known as [[East Pakistan]]) in 1947–1951. Between the period of first patches (1946–1951), around 274,455 Bengali Hindu refugees have arrived from what is now called Bangladesh (former [[East Pakistan]]) in various locations of Assam as permanent settlers and again in second patches between (1952–1958) of the same decade, around 212,545 Bengali Hindus from Bangladesh took shelter in various parts of the state permanently.<ref>India (1951).

===Floods===
{{Main|Brahmaputra floods}}
In the rainy season every year, the Brahmaputra and other rivers overflow their banks and flood adjacent land. Flood waters wash away property including houses and livestock. Damage to crops and fields harms the agricultural sector. Bridges, railway tracks, and roads are also damaged, harming transportation and communication, and in some years requiring food to be air-dropped to isolated towns. Some deaths are attributed to the floods.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.ndtv.com/india-news/assam-flood-toll-rises-to-13-chief-minister-gogoi-undertakes-aerial-visit-1210178 |title=Assam Flood Toll Rises to 13 |publisher=NDTV |date=23 August 2015 |access-date=25 August 2015 |archive-date=24 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824155525/http://m.ndtv.com/india-news/assam-flood-toll-rises-to-13-chief-minister-gogoi-undertakes-aerial-visit-1210178 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flood-situation-in-assam-worsens-7-dead-over-650-000-displaced/article1-1383226.aspx |title=Flood situation in Assam worsens |work=Hindustan Times |date=23 August 2015 |access-date=25 August 2015}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Assam schools are run by the Indian government, government of Assam or by private organisations. Medium of instruction is mainly in Assamese, English or Bengali. Most of the schools follow the state's examination board which is called the [[Secondary Education Board of Assam]].  All schools under [[Government of Assam]] are assessed by [[Gunoutsav Assam]] .Almost all private schools follow the [[Central Board for Secondary Education]] (CBSE), [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education]] (ICSE) and [[Indian School Certificate]] (ISC) syllabuses.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Assamese language is the main medium in educational institutions but [[Bengali language]] is also taught as a major [[Languages of India|Indian language]].

=== Macro-economy ===
The economy of Assam today represents a unique juxtaposition of backwardness amidst plenty.<ref>National Commission for Women 2004</ref>{{full citation needed|date=May 2022}} Despite its rich natural resources, and supplying of up to 25% of India's petroleum needs, Assam's growth rate has not kept pace with that of India; the difference has increased rapidly since the 1970s.<ref name="AHDR2003">UNDP 2004, pp. 22–23</ref> The Indian economy grew at 6% per annum over the period of 1981 to 2000; the growth rate of Assam was only 3.3%.<ref>UNDP 2004, p. 22</ref> In the Sixth Plan period, Assam experienced a negative growth rate of 3.78% when India's was positive at 6%.<ref name="AHDR2003" /> In the post-liberalised era (after 1991), the difference widened further.

According to recent analysis, Assam's economy is showing signs of improvement. In 2001–02, the economy grew (at 1993–94 constant prices) at 4.5%, falling to 3.4% in the next financial year.<ref name="GoAESA0405">{{cite web |author=Government of Assam |title=Economic Survey of Assam 2004–2005 in NEDFi, Assam Profile, NER Databank |year=2006 |url=http://databank.nedfi.com/index.php?module=pagemaster&PAGE_user_op=view_page&PAGE_id=4| access-date = 6 June 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081231164030/http://databank.nedfi.com/index.php?module=pagemaster&PAGE_user_op=view_page&PAGE_id=4| archive-date = 31 December 2008| url-status=live }}</ref> During 2003–04 and 2004–05, the economy grew (at 1993–94 constant prices) at 5.5% and 5.3% respectively.<ref name="GoAESA0405" /> The advanced estimates placed the growth rate for 2005–06 at above 6%.<ref name="government2005" /> Assam's GDP in 2004 is estimated at $13&nbsp;billion in current prices. Sectoral analysis again exhibits a dismal picture. The average annual growth rate of agriculture, which was 2.6% per annum over the 1980s, has fallen to 1.6% in the 1990s.<ref name="AHDR2003II">UNDP 2004, pp. 24–25</ref> The manufacturing sector showed some improvement in the 1990s with a growth rate of 3.4% per annum than 2.4% in the 1980s.<ref name="AHDR2003II" /> For the past five decades, the tertiary sector has registered the highest growth rates of the other sectors, which even has slowed down in the 1990s than in the 1980s.<ref name="AHDR2003II" />

=== Employment ===
Unemployment is one of the major problems in Assam. This problem can be attributed to overpopulation and a faulty education system. Every year, large numbers of students obtain higher academic degrees but because of non-availability of proportional vacancies, most of these students remain unemployed.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/Poor-infrastructure-stringent-policies-bottleneck-for-Assams-growth-Assocham/articleshow/48003338.cms |title=Poor infrastructure, stringent policies bottleneck for Assam's growth |newspaper=The Economic Times |date=9 July 2015 |access-date=25 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826135157/http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/poor-infrastructure-stringent-policies-bottleneck-for-assams-growth-assocham/articleshow/48003338.cms |archive-date=26 August 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/assam/panel-for-study-of-unemployment-problem-in-assam_807697.html |title=Panel for study of unemployment problem in Assam |publisher=Zee News |date=26 October 2012 |access-date=25 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925135649/http://zeenews.india.com/news/assam/panel-for-study-of-unemployment-problem-in-assam_807697.html |archive-date=25 September 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> A number of employers hire over-qualified or efficient, but under-certified, candidates, or candidates with narrowly defined qualifications. The problem is exacerbated by the growth in the number of technical institutes in Assam which increases the unemployed community of the State. The reluctance on the part of the departments concerned to advertise vacancies in vernacular language has also made matters worse for local unemployed youths particularly for the job-seekers of Grade C and D vacancies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/mdetails.asp?id=oct1713/at098 |title=The Assam Tribune |publisher=The Assam Tribune |date=17 October 2013 |access-date=25 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923200248/http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/mdetails.asp?id=oct1713%2Fat098 |archive-date=23 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/mdetails.asp?id=jan2114/city07 |title=The Assam Tribune |publisher=The Assam Tribune |date=21 January 2014 |access-date=25 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923200246/http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/mdetails.asp?id=jan2114%2Fcity07 |archive-date=23 September 2015}}</ref>

Reduction of the unemployed has been threatened by [[illegal immigration]] from Bangladesh. This has increased the workforce without a commensurate increase in jobs. Immigrants compete with local workers for jobs at lower wages, particularly in construction, domestics, Rickshaw-pullers, and vegetable sellers.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-08-05/news/65244059_1_foreigners-tribunals-illegal-migrants-assam |title=Centre taking steps to check illegal immigration into Assam |newspaper=The Economic Times |date=5 August 2015 |access-date=25 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925123930/http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-08-05/news/65244059_1_foreigners-tribunals-illegal-migrants-assam |archive-date=25 September 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://m.hindustantimes.com/india-news/soon-blueprint-to-detect-deport-illegal-bangladeshis-in-assam/article1-1294954.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.today/20151216080510/http://m.hindustantimes.com/india-news/soon-blueprint-to-detect-deport-illegal-bangladeshis-in-assam/article1-1294954.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 December 2015 |title=Soon blueprint to deport illegal Bangladeshis in Assam |newspaper=Hindustan Times |date=10 December 2014 |access-date=25 August 2015}}</ref> The government has been identifying (via [[National Register of Citizens for Assam|NRC]]) and deporting illegal immigrants.

In Assam among all the productive sectors, agriculture makes the highest contribution to its domestic sectors, accounting for more than a third of Assam's income and employs 69% of workforce.<ref>{{cite web |author=Government of Assam |title=Economic Survey of Assam 2001–2002 in Assam Human Development Report, 2003 |page=32 |url=http://planassam.org/reports/hdr_2003/HRD.htm  |access-date=6 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220213032/http://planassam.org/reports/hdr_2003/HRD.htm |archive-date=20 February 2007}}</ref> Assam's biggest contribution to the world is [[Assam tea]].

Assam's agriculture is yet to experience modernisation in a real sense. With implications for food security, per capita food grain production has declined in the past five decades.<ref name="AHDR2003III">UNDP 2004, p. 33</ref> Productivity has increased marginally, but is still low compared to highly productive regions.

Floods in Assam greatly affect the farmers and the families dependent on agriculture because of large-scale damage of agricultural fields and crops by flood water.<ref name="Assam Flood Toll Rises to 13" /><ref name="Flood situation in Assam worsens" /> Every year, flooding from the Brahmaputra and other rivers deluges places in Assam. The water levels of the rivers rise because of rainfall resulting in the rivers overflowing their banks and engulfing nearby areas. Apart from houses and livestock being washed away by flood water, bridges, railway tracks and roads are also damaged by the calamity, which causes communication breakdown in many places. Fatalities are also caused by the natural disaster in many places of the state.<ref name="Assam Flood Toll Rises to 132">{{cite web |url=http://m.ndtv.com/india-news/assam-flood-toll-rises-to-13-chief-minister-gogoi-undertakes-aerial-visit-1210178 |title=Assam Flood Toll Rises to 13 |date=23 August 2015 |publisher=NDTV|access-date=25 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824155525/http://m.ndtv.com/india-news/assam-flood-toll-rises-to-13-chief-minister-gogoi-undertakes-aerial-visit-1210178|archive-date=24 August 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Flood situation in Assam worsens2">{{cite news |url=http://m.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flood-situation-in-assam-worsens-7-dead-over-650-000-displaced/article1-1383226.aspx |title=Flood situation in Assam worsens |date=23 August 2015 |newspaper=Hindustan Times|access-date=25 August 2015}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>{{See also|2016 Assam floods}}

Assam's proximity to some neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, benefits its trade. The major [[Border checkpoint]]s through which border trade flows to Bangladesh from Assam are : Sutarkandi (Karimganj), Dhubri, Mankachar (Dhubri) and Golokanj. To facilitate border trade with Bangladesh, Border Trade Centres have been developed at Sutarkandi and [[Mankachar]]. It has been proposed in the 11th five-year plan{{clarify|WHOSE five-year plan?|date=January 2015}} to set up two more Border Trade Center, one at [[Ledo, Assam|Ledo]] connecting China and other at [[Darrang]] connecting Bhutan.

[[Assamese Culture]] is described as a [[Hybridity|hybrid]] and [[syncretic]] in nature developed due to the assimilation of numerous ethnic groups and cultural practices of [[Austroasiatic]], [[Tibeto-Burman]], [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-aryan]] and [[Tai peoples|Tai]] inhabitants. Therefore, both local elements or the local elements in Sanskritised forms are distinctly found.<ref name="BKakatiAIFD">{{Citation |first=Banikanta |last=Kakati |title=Assamese, Its Formation and Development, 2nd edition |place=Guwahati, India |publisher=Lawyer's Book Stall |year=1962}}</ref> The major milestones in the evolution of Assamese culture are:
[[File:Dakhinpat Temple.jpg|thumb|{{center|Dakhinpat Satra of [[Majuli]]}}]]

* Assimilation in the [[Kamarupa|Kamarupa kingdom]] for almost 800 years ([[Varman dynasty]] for 300 years, [[Mlechchha dynasty]] for 250 years and the [[Pala dynasty (Kamarupa)|Pala dynasty]] for 200 years.<ref name="HKBarpujariCHOA" />
* Establishment of the [[Chutia kingdom]] in the 12th century in eastern Assam and assimilation for next 400 years.<ref name="HKBarpujariCHOA" />
* Establishment of the [[Ahom kingdom]] in the 13th century CE and assimilation for next 600 years.<ref name="HKBarpujariCHOA" />
* Assimilation in the [[Koch kingdom]] (15th–16th century CE) of western Assam and Kachari kingdom (12th–18th century CE) of central and southern Assam.<ref name="HKBarpujariCHOA" />
* [[Ekasarana Dharma|Neo-Vaishanavite (Ekasarana Dharma)]] Movement led by [[Srimanta Shankardeva]] (''Xongkordeu'') made an enormous impact on the socio-cultural and religious sphere of Assam. This 15th century religio-cultural movement under the leadership of [[Srimanta Sankardeva]] (Xonkordeu) and his disciples have provided another dimension to Assamese culture. A renewed Hinduisation in local forms took place, which was initially greatly supported by the Koch and later by the Ahom kingdoms. The resultant social institutions such as ''[[namghar]]'' and ''[[sattra]]'' (the Vaishnav Monasteries) have become an integral part of the Assamese way of life. The movement contributed greatly towards language, literature, and performing and fine arts.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}. It was also an egalitarian reform movement as it broke away with the old caste barriers of Brahmanical Hinduism and converted into its fold people of all castes, ethnicity and religions (including [[Islam]]).
[[File:Celebrations 1.jpg|thumb|left|{{center|Presenting ''[[Gayan Bayan]]'' in [[Majuli]], the Neo-Vaishnavite cultural heritage of Assam}}]]
The modern culture has been influenced by events in the British and the post-British era. [[Assamese language|Assamese]] language was standardised by American [[Baptist]] [[Missionary|Missionaries]] such as [[Nathan Brown (missionary)|Nathan Brown]], [[Miles Bronson and the Noctes|Dr. Miles Bronson]] and local pundits such as [[Hemchandra Barua]] with the dialect spoken in undivided [[Sibsagar]] district (the centre of the Ahom kingdom) forming the standardised dialect. {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Increasing efforts of standardisation in the 20th century alienated the localised forms present in different areas and with the less-assimilated [[Ethnic groups|ethno-cultural groups]] (many source-cultures). However, Assamese culture in its hybrid form and nature is one of the richest, still developing and in true sense is a '[[cultural system]]' with sub-systems. Many source-cultures of the Assamese cultural-system are still surviving either as sub-systems or as sister entities, e.g. the; [[Bodo people|Bodo]] or [[Karbi people|Karbi]] or [[Mising people|Mishing]]. It is important to keep the broader system closer to its roots and at the same time focus on development of the sub-systems.

Some of the common and unique cultural traits in the region are peoples' respect towards [[Betel nut|areca-nut]] and [[betel]] leaves, symbolic ([[gamosa]], arnai, etc.), [[Assam silk|traditional silk]] garments (e.g. [[mekhela chador]], traditional dress of Assamese women) and towards forefathers and elderly. Moreover, great hospitality and bamboo culture are common.

=== Symbols ===
{{See also|List of Assam state symbols|Jaapi}}

[[File:Jaapi with Gamosa.jpg|thumb|upright|{{center|A decorative Assamese ''[[Jaapi]]'' laid over a Gamosa}}]]
Symbolism is an ancient cultural practice in Assam and is still a very important part of the Assamese way of life. Various elements are used to represent beliefs, feelings, pride, identity, etc.

'''Tamulpan''' (areca nut and betel leaves),
'''[[Xorai]]''' and '''[[Gamosa of Assam|Gamosa]]''' are three important symbolic elements in Assamese culture. ''Tamulpan'' or ''guapan'' (gua from ''kwa'') are considered along with the Gamosa (a typical woven cotton or silk cloth with embroidery) as the offers of devotion, respect and friendship. The Tamulpan-tradition is an ancient one and is being followed since time-immemorial with roots in the aboriginal Austric culture. ''[[Xorai]]'' is a traditionally manufactured bell-metal article of great respect and is used as a container-medium while performing respectful offers. Moreover, symbolically many ethno-cultural groups use specific clothes to portray respect and pride.

[[File:Monikutdhekiakhowa.JPG|thumb|Singhasan of manikut in a [[Namghar]]]]
There were many other symbolic elements and designs, but are now only found in literature, art, sculpture, architecture, etc. or in use today for only religious purposes. The typical designs of ''Assamese-lion'', ''dragon'' (ngi-ngao-kham), and ''flying-lion'' (Naam-singho) are used for symbolising various purposes and occasions. The archaeological sites such as the [[Madan Kamdev]] (c. 9th–10th centuries CE) exhibits mass-scale use of lions, dragon-lions and many other figures of demons to show case power and prosperity.[[File:Jhumura.jpg|thumb|Jhumura]] The Vaishnavite monasteries ([[Satra (Ekasarana Dharma)|Sattras]]) and many other architectural sites of the late medieval period display the use of lions and dragons for symbolic effects.

There are diversified important traditional festivals in Assam. Bihu is the most important festival of Assam and is celebrated all over the state.The Assamese new year (Ek Bohag) is celebrated in April of the Gregorian calendar.

[[File:Husori in Bihu.jpg|thumb|left|Husori in Bihu]]

'''[[Bihu]]''' is described as the soul and life of Assam. It is a series of three prominent festivals each associated with a certain stage during the cultivation of paddy. Primarily a secular festival celebrated to mark the seasons and the significant points of a cultivator's life over yearly cycle. Three Bihus, ''rongali'' (in the month of ''bohag''), celebrated with the coming of spring and the beginning of the sowing season; ''kongali'' or ''kati'', the barren bihu when the fields are lush but the barns are empty and ''[[Bhogali Bihu|bhogali]]'' (in the month of ''magh''), the thanksgiving when the crops have been harvested and the granaries are full. Bihu songs and [[Bihu dance]] are associated with ''rongali'' and ''bhogali'' bihu. The day before the each bihu is known as the day of '''Uruka'''. The first day of 'Rongali bihu' is called 'Goru bihu' (the bihu of the cows), when the cows are taken to the nearby rivers or ponds to be bathed with special care. In recent times the form and nature of celebration has changed with the growth of urban centres.

[[File:Bwisagu Dance.jpg|thumb|Traditional Bwisagu dance]]
'''[[Bwisagu]]''' is one of the most popular seasonal festivals of the [[Bodo people|Bodos]]. '''Baisagu''' is a Boro word which originated from the word "Baisa" which means year or age, and "Agu" meaning starting or beginning. Bwisagu marks the beginning of the new year. It is celebrated at the beginning of the first month of the Boro year, around mid-April in the Gregorian Calendar. It has remarkable similarities to the festival of Rongali Bihu, also celebrated at the same time in Assam. The worship of Bathow is done on the second day of the festival.

[[File:Mising girls dancing During Ali-Aye-Ligang.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mising people|Mising girls]] dancing during [[Ali Ai Ligang]] (Spring Festival) to the tunes of [[Oi Nitom|Oi:Nitom]]]]

'''[[Ali Ai Ligang|Ali-Aye-Ligang]]''' or Ali-Ai-Ligang is a spring festivital associated with agriculture celebrated by the indigenous [[Mising people|Mising]] of Assam and other Northeast Indian states. It marks the beginning of the Ahu paddy cultivation in the farms. The term "Ali" denotes legumes, "Aye" means seed and "Ligang" is 'to sow'. The festival is celebrated on a Wednesday of the month of Fagun of the Assamese calendar and in the month of February in English calendar. The ''gumrag'' dance is associated with this festival.

[[File:Barman Dimasa Girl.jpg|thumb|[[Dimasa people|Dimasa women]] performing Baidima, the traditional dance of the Dimasa people.]]

'''[[Dimasa people#Festivals|Bushu Dima]]''' or simply Bushu is a major harvest festival of the [[Dimasa people]]. This festival is celebrated during the end of January. Officially 27 January has been declared as the day of Bushu Dima festival. The Dimasa people celebrate by playing musical instruments- khram (a type of drum), muri (a kind of huge long flute). The people dance to the different tunes of "murithai" and each dance has its own unique name, the most prominent being the "Baidima" There are three types of Bushu celebrated by the Dimasas- Jidap, Surem and Hangsou.

'''[[Me-Dam-Me-Phi]]''' is the day of the [[Veneration of the dead#Assam|veneration of the dead ancestors]] for the [[Tai-Ahom]] community. It bears striking similarity in the concept of ancestor worship that the Tai-Ahoms share with other peoples originating from the [[Tai peoples|Tai]] stock. The word ‘Me’ means offerings, ‘Dam’ means ancestors and ‘Phi’ means gods. According to the Buranjis, Lengdon (God of thunder), the king of Mong Phi ([[Tian|The heavenly kingdom]]), sent two of his grandsons Khunlung and Khunlai to Mong Ri Mong Ram (present day [[Xishuangbanna]], China) and at that moment Ye-Cheng-Pha, the God of knowledge, advised them to perform Umpha, Phuralong, Mae Dam Mae Phi and Rik-khwan rituals in different months of the year on different occasions to pay respect to the [[Tai folk religion|Phi-Dam]] (Ancestral Spirit) and Khwan elements. Since that day till now Mae Dam Mae Phi has been observed by the Tai-Ahoms. It is celebrated on 31 January every year according to the Gregorian calendar.

'''Rongker''' also called '''Dehal''' is an annual winter festival of merriment celebrated by the [[Karbi people]] of Assam. It is observed in order to appease the local deities associated with the welfare of the village and the harvest of crops and also to get rid of all evil spirits. Although the festival does have a specific time it is usually observed at the beginning of the Karbi New year (Thang thang) which falls on February of the Gregorian calendar.

[[File:Holi at Barpeta22.jpg|thumb|left|Doul Mohutsav (Holi) in [[Barpeta Satra]]]]

'''Doul Mohutsav''', also called '''Fakuwa''' or Doul Utsav is a festival of colours and happiness popular in [[Lower Assam]] and especially in [[Barpeta district|Barpeta]]. It is synonymous with the festival of [[Holi]] celebrated in Northern India. Holigeets of Barpeta are sung which is incredibly popular and enthralls the heart of every Assamese. These holigeets are the exquisite compositions in praise of [[Lord Krishna]]. People from different parts of the state visit Barpeta Satra to experience this colourful and joyful festival.

'''Chavang Kut''' is a post harvesting festival of the [[Kuki people]]. The festival is celebrated on the first day of November every year. Hence, this particular day has been officially declared as a Restricted Holiday by the Assam government. In the past, the celebration was primarily important in the religio-cultural sense. The rhythmic movements of the dances in the festival were inspired by animals, agricultural techniques and showed their relationship with ecology. Today, the celebration witnesses the shifting of stages and is revamped to suit new contexts and interpretations. The traditional dances which form the core of the festival is now performed in out-of-village settings and are staged in a secular public sphere. In Assam, the Kukis mainly reside in the two autonomous districts of Dima Hasao and Karbi Anglong.

'''Beshoma''' is a festival of [[Deshi people]] (one of the indigenous [[Muslim]] groups of Assam).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nenow.in/north-east-news/bihu-myriad-colours.html |title=Bihu – Its Myriad Colours |website=NORTHEAST NOW |date=20 April 2018 |language=en-US |access-date=8 September 2019 |archive-date=21 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190921143102/https://nenow.in/north-east-news/bihu-myriad-colours.html |url-status=live }}</ref> It is a celebration of sowing crop.

=== Fine arts ===
{{Main|Painting of Assam}}

The archaic [[Mauryan Empire|Mauryan]] [[Stupas]] discovered in and around [[Goalpara district]] are the earliest examples (c. 300&nbsp;BCE to c. 100&nbsp;CE) of ancient art and architectural works. The remains discovered in Daparvatiya (''Doporboteeya'') archaeological site with a beautiful doorframe in Tezpur are identified as the best examples of artwork in ancient Assam with influence of [[Sarnath]] School of Art of the late [[Gupta empire|Gupta]] period.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Painting is an ancient tradition of Assam. [[Xuanzang]] (7th century&nbsp;CE) mentions that among the Kamarupa king Bhaskaravarma's gifts to [[Harshavardhana]] there were paintings and painted objects, some of which were on Assamese silk. Many of the manuscripts such as [[Hastividyarnava]] (A Treatise on Elephants), the ''Chitra Bhagawata'' and in the Gita Govinda from the Middle Ages bear excellent examples of traditional paintings.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Cane and bamboo craft provide the most commonly used utilities in daily life, ranging from household utilities, weaving accessories, fishing accessories, furniture, musical instruments, construction materials, etc. Utilities and symbolic articles such as ''Sorai'' and ''Bota'' made from bell metal and brass are found in every Assamese household.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Ranjan |first1=M.P. |last2=Iyer |first2=Nilam |last3=Pandya |first3=Ghanshyam |title=Bamboo and Cane Crafts of Northeast India |publisher=National Institute of Design}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |first=T.K. |last=Nath |title=Bamboo Cane and Assam |place=Guwahati, India |publisher=Industrial Development Bank of India, Small Industries Development Bank of India}}</ref> [[Hajo]] and [[Sarthebari]] (''Sorthebaary'') are the most important centres of traditional bell-metal and brass crafts. Assam is the home of several types of silks, the most prestigious are: Muga – the natural golden silk, Pat – a creamy-bright-silver coloured silk and Eri – a variety used for manufacturing warm clothes for winter. Apart from [[Sualkuchi]] (''Xualkuchi''), the centre for the traditional silk industry, in almost every parts of the Brahmaputra Valley, rural households produce silk and silk garments with excellent embroidery designs. Moreover, various ethno-cultural groups in Assam make different types of cotton garments with unique embroidery designs and wonderful colour combinations.
