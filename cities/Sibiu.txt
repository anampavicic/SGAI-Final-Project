Nicknamed ''The Town with Eyes'' (given its historical buildings with partly open rooftops), the town is a well-known tourist destination for both domestic and foreign visitors. Known for its culture, history, [[gastronomy]] or local [[cuisine]], and diverse architecture, which includes the iconic [[Eyes of Sibiu|houses with eyes]] that gave Sibiu its nickname, the town has garnered significant attention since the beginning of the 21st century.

In 2004, its historical center was added to the tentative list of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s.

As of 2021 census, the city has a population of 134,309,<ref name="RPL2021"/> making it the [[List of cities and towns in Romania|15th-largest city]] in Romania. The proposed Sibiu metropolitan area has a population of 267,170. The town also administers the village of [[Păltiniș]], a ski resort located 35 kilometres to the southwest.

During the [[High Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages]], Sibiu was the most important cultural and administrative centre of the [[Transylvanian Saxons]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedockyards.com/the-history-of-the-transylvanian-saxons|author=Victor Rouă|work=The Dockyards|title=The History Of The Transylvanian Saxons|date=3 October 2015|access-date= 9 March 2021}}</ref> It is called ''Härmeschtat'' in [[Transylvanian Saxon dialect|their local dialect]], which is close to [[Luxembourgish]], from which it primarily descended during the [[Ostsiedlung]].<ref>{{cite web|language=en|url=https://today.rtl.lu/your-luxembourg/knowledge-bites/a/1411526.html|title=The Transylvanian Saxon dialect, a not-so-distant cousin of Luxembourgish|author=Nathalie Lodhi|work=RTL Today|date=13 January 2020|accessdate=7 February 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedockyards.com/the-transylvanian-saxon-dialect|author=Victor Rouă|work=The Dockyards|title=A Brief History Of The Transylvanian Saxon Dialect|date= 19 August 2015|access-date= 24 June 2020}}</ref>

== Name ==

The name of the city derives from the Bulgar-Turkic name Sibin<Sebin<Säbin, meaning "rejoice".<ref>{{citation |last=Rásonyi |first=László |title=Bulaqs and Oguzs in Medieval Transylvania |url=http://real-j.mtak.hu/3477/1/ActaOrientalia_33.pdf |journal=Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae |volume=33 |page=135 |year=1979 |publisher=[[Akadémiai Kiadó]]}}</ref> An archaic version of the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] name Sibiu is ''Sibiiu'', while an obsolete folk name is ''Sâghii'', formerly spelled ''Sîghii''. Its [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] name is ''Nagyszeben'' ("Big/Greater Sibiu"), or colloquially, ''Szeben''.

In German, it is called ''Hermannstadt'' ("Hermann's town"), while in the local [[Transylvanian Saxon dialect]], it is known as ''Härmeschtat''. In [[Yiddish]], it is called סעבען ''Seben'' or הערמאנשטאט ''Hermanshtat''.

A number of other languages also have their own variants of the city's name, like [[Czech language|Czech]] ''Sibiň'', [[Polish language|Polish]] ''Sybin'', [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] ''Sibinj'', Old [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''Sibin'' (Сибин) and the proposed [[Esperanto]] name ''Sibio''.

The Roman fort of [[Cedonia (castra)|Cedonia]] was perhaps in the same location as Sibiu. The town was founded by [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]] ([[Germans|German]]) settlers brought there by [[King of Hungary]] and [[King of Croatia]] [[Géza II of Hungary|Géza II]] during the mid-late 12th century, as part of the [[Ostsiedlung]]. They came from territories of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and [[France in the Middle Ages|Kingdom of France]] (nowadays parts of Germany, France and the [[Benelux]] countries) and arrived at around 1147.<ref name="Hermannstadt in Siebenbürgen">{{cite web |url=https://www.skr.de/rumaenien-reisen/sehenswuerdigkeiten/hermannstadt-sibiu-in-siebenbuergen/ |title=Hermannstadt (Sibiu) in Siebenbürgen |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=skr.de |access-date=2 May 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Hannover Moser |first=Birgitta Gabriela |date=2011 |title=Siebenbürgen: Rund um Kronstadt, Schäßburg und Hermannstadt |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yvb8ksEOBB8C |location=Germany |publisher=Trescher Verlag |page=107 |isbn=978-3-89794-157-1}}</ref> The first references to the area were ''Cibinium'' and ''Cipin'' from 1191 when Pope [[Celestine III]] confirmed the existence of the free [[prepositure]] of the Saxons in Transylvania, having its headquarters in Sibiu.<ref>{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422163814/http://www.turism.sibiu.ro/en/istorie.htm |date=22 April 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://typographia.oszk.hu/html/hun/nyomdak/szebeni_varosi.htm |title=A szebeni városi nyomda |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=typographia.oszk.hu |access-date=2 May 2020 }}</ref> The city also used the names ''Prepositus Cibiniensis'' (1192–1196) and ''Prepositus Scibiniensis'' (1211).

In the 14th century, it was already an important trade centre. In 1376, the craftsmen were divided in 19 [[guild]]s.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, the city became the second- <!-- to what? --> and later the first-most important centre of Transylvanian Romanian ethnics. The first Romanian-owned bank had its headquarters here (The ''Albina'' Bank), as did the [[Asociația Transilvană pentru Literatura Română și Cultura Poporului Român|ASTRA]] (Transylvanian Association for Romanian Literature and Romanian's People Culture). After the [[Romanian Orthodox]] Church was granted status in the [[Austrian Empire]] from the 1860s onwards, Sibiu became the [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan seat]], and the city is still regarded as the third-most important centre of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]. Between the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] and 1867 (the year of the ''[[Ausgleich]]''), Hermannstadt was the meeting-place of the [[Transylvanian Diet]], which had taken its most representative form after the Empire agreed to extend voting rights in the region.

After [[World War I]], when [[Austria-Hungary]] was dissolved and Sibiu became part of the [[Kingdom of Romania]]; the majority of its population was still ethnically German (until 1941) and counted a large Romanian community as well as a smaller Hungarian one. Starting from the 1950s and until 1990, most of the town's ethnic Germans emigrated to [[West Germany]] and [[Austria]]. The trend continued to a moderate extent after 1990 as well to unified [[Germany]]. Nonetheless, among the approximately 2,000 Transylvanian Saxons who decided to remain as per the [[2011 Romanian census]] was [[Klaus Iohannis]], the {{As of|2014|alt=current}} [[President of Romania]] and former longtime mayor of the town between [[2000 Romanian local elections|2000]] and 2014, who was succeeded by [[Astrid Fodor]] since 2014 onwards, initially [[ad interim]]/[[acting (law)|acting]], and then, subsequently in full constitutional powers after [[2016 Romanian local elections|2016]].

In 2007, Sibiu was the [[European Capital of Culture]] (alongside [[Luxembourg City|Luxembourg]]). This was the most important cultural event that has ever happened in the town, and a great number of tourists came, both domestic and foreign.

The city of Sibiu and its surroundings are one of the most visited areas in Romania, as it holds one of the best preserved historical sites in the country, many of its medieval fortifications having been kept in excellent state. Its old center has begun the process for becoming a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 2004. Sibiu and its surrounding area have many significant museums, with 12+ institutions housing art collections, paintings, and exhibits in decorative arts, archeology, anthropology, history, industrial archeology and history of technology and natural sciences.

The city also lies close to the [[Făgăraș Mountains]] – a popular trekking destination, close to the city of [[Păltiniș]] and Arena Platoș ski resorts – both winter holiday destinations, and it is at the heart of the former Saxon communities in Transylvania renowned for its [[Villages with fortified churches in Transylvania|fortified churches]].

Since 2007, a traditional [[Christmas market]] has been held in Sibiu. The first of its kind in [[Romania]], it is inspired by Viennese Christmas markets, being a project developed by the Social Attaché of the Austrian Embassy in Romania, dr.h.c. Barbara Schöfnagel. It was held in the "Lesser Square" (Piața Mică) with 38 small stalls, a small stage and an area dedicated to children, having several mechanical attractions installed there. Since 2008, the market is held in the "Grand Square" (Piaţa Mare) grew to a number of about 70 stalls, a bigger stage was set up, where Christmas carols concerts are held. An ice skating rink and a children's workshop are also attractions which have been added in the following years.<ref name="Sibiu Christmas Market">{{cite web |url=http://www.targuldecraciun.ro |title=Târgul de Crăciun din Sibiu |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201014302/http://targuldecraciun.ro/ |archive-date=1 December 2009 }}</ref> It was the first Christmas Market in Romania, but soon other Christmas markets emerged across the country.

In 2019, Sibiu had planned to host the European Gastronomical capital, by encouraging the local producers and businesses in the field of food production and culinary and gourmet culture, traditional workshops in the villages of the region, promoting farms and gastronomic circuits, or developing public programs to support small businesses in gastronomy and of the hospitality industry in the Sibiu region.<ref name="EROG">{{cite web |url=https://www.europeanregionofgastronomy.org/platform/sibiu-2019/ |title=Sibiu 2019 – European Regions of Gastronomy |website=europeanregionofgastronomy.org |publisher=International Institute of Gastronomy, Culture, Arts and Tourism (IGCAT) |access-date=2 May 2020}}</ref>

==Culture==
Sibiu has two theatres and a philharmonic orchestra along with other smaller private theatrical venues and a theatre studio housed by the Performing Arts and Acting section of [[Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu|Lucian Blaga University]], where students hold monthly representations.

The [[Radu Stanca National Theatre]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sibfest.ro |title=Radu Stanca National Theatre |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909051037/http://www.sibfest.ro/ |archive-date=9 September 2006 }}</ref> is one of the leading Romanian theatres. With origins dating back to 1787, it attracts some of the best-known Romanian directors, such as [[Gábor Tompa]] and Silviu Purcărete. It has both a Romanian-language and a German-language section, and presents an average of five shows a week.

The [[Gong Theatre]] is specialised in puppetry, mime and non-conventional shows for children and teenagers. It also presents shows in both Romanian and German.

The [[State Philharmonic of Sibiu]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filarmonicasibiu.ro/ |title=State Philharmonic of Sibiu |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120155011/http://www.filarmonicasibiu.ro/ |archive-date=20 November 2012 }}</ref> presents weekly classical music concerts, and educational concerts for children and teenagers.

[[File:Brukenthalpalais Hermannstadt.jpg|thumb|Brukenthal National Museum, Sibiu]]

===Museums and parks===

Sibiu's museums are organised around two entities: the [[Brukenthal National Museum]] and the [[ASTRA National Museum Complex]]. The Brukenthal Museum consists of an Art Gallery and an Old Books Library located inside the Brukenthal Palace, a History Museum located in the old town hall building, a Pharmacy Museum located in one of the first [[apothecary]] shops in Europe, dating from the 16th century, a Natural History Museum and a Museum of Arms and Hunting Trophies.

The [[ASTRA National Museum Complex]] focuses on [[ethnography]], and consists of a Traditional Folk Civilisation Museum, a 96-hectare open-air museum located in Dumbrava Forest south of Sibiu, a Universal Ethnography Museum, a Museum of Transylvanian Civilisation and a Museum of Saxon Ethnography and Folk Art. Also planned is a Museum of the Culture and Civilisation of the Romany People.

The [[Dumbrava Sibiului Natural Park]] stretches over {{cvt|960|ha}} and it is {{cvt|4|km}} away from the center of the city in the southwest direction along the road towards Rășinari. Also, here you can find the Zoological Garden and Ethnography Museum.

There is a [[Sibiu Steam Locomotives Museum|Steam Locomotives Museum]] close to the railway station, sheltering around 40 [[steam locomotive|locomotives]], two of which are functional.

The first park in the city was The Promenade, later called "The Disabled Promenade." established in 1791, today part of Parcul Cetății (Citadel Park). Current arrangement of the park, including the space between the walls, dates from 1928.

The Sub Arini Park, established between 1857 and 1859 based on plans of military engineer Michael Seyfried,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.siebenbuerger.de/zeitung/artikel/kultur/14902-eine-graefin-mit-herz.html |title=Eine Gräfin mit Herz |last=Klein |first=Konrad |date=17 October 2014 |website=siebenbuerger.de |access-date=3 May 2020 }}</ref> is one of the biggest and best-maintained parks in Romania. There are other green spaces in the city center, the best known being Astra Park, established in 1879.

Other parks:

Tineretului Park, Reconstrucției Park, Corneliu Coposu Park, Petöfi Sándor Park, Piața Cluj Park, Ștrand Park, Cristianului Park, Țițeica Park, Vasile Aaron Park, Lira Park.

The distribution of green space is good compared to other Romanian cities.

===Events===

[[File:Parcul Cetatii.jpg|thumb|Citadel Park, with the 16th century city wall]]

Several festivals are organised yearly in Sibiu, the most prestigious of them being the [[Sibiu International Theatre Festival]], organized each spring at the end of May. Medieval Festival organized every year in August, reviving the medieval spirit of [[Transylvania]]. The [[Artmania Festival]] is held every Summer since 2006 and as of 2008 the Rockin' Transilvania Festival is also held in Sibiu.

Sibiu was awarded by IGCAT (International Institute of Gastronomy, Culture, Arts and Tourism) to be part of the European Regions of Gastronomy program, event that will promote in 2019 the region's culinary heritage, multi-ethnic traditions and multi-cultural community.

=== European Cultural Capital ===

The designation of Sibiu as [[European Capital of Culture|European Cultural Capital]] in 2007 was owed greatly to the excellent collaboration with [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]] (and to the noteworthy historical ties between the Transylvanian Saxon community and [[Luxembourg]]), but also to what many regard as a miraculous social rebirth taking place in the town during the last years. The Cultural Capital status was expected to bring about an abrupt increase in quantity and quality of cultural events in 2007 and so it did.

== Administration ==
