'''Pavlodar''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɑː|v|l|ə|ˈ|d|ɑːr}}; {{Langx|kk|Павлодар}} {{IPA|kk|pɑvɫəˈdɑr|}} {{Pronunciation|Kk-pavlodar.ogg|listen|(|help=no}}; {{Langx|ru|Павлодар}} {{IPA|ru|pəvɫɐˈdar|}}) is a city in northeastern [[Kazakhstan]] and the capital of [[Pavlodar Region]]. It is located {{convert|450|km}} northeast of the national capital [[Astana]] and {{convert|405|km}} southeast of the [[Russia]]n city of [[Omsk]] along the [[Irtysh|Irtysh River]]. In 2010, the city had a population of 331,710.<ref name="stat">{{cite web|url=http://www.oblstat.pavl.kz/rus/pavlcity|title=Pavlodar Statistics|website=pavl.kz|access-date=13 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722142438/http://www.oblstat.pavl.kz/rus/pavlcity|archive-date=22 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> The population of Pavlodar is composed predominantly of ethnic [[Kazakhs]] and [[Russians]], with significant [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], [[Volga Germans|German]] and [[Tatar]] minorities. The city is served by [[Pavlodar Airport]].

==History==
One of the oldest cities in northern Kazakhstan, Pavlodar was founded in the 9th century as the settlements of Khakan-Kimak and Imakia, the capitals of the [[Kimek–Kipchak confederation]].

Koryakovsky fort was founded in 1720 as an Imperial Russian outpost. The settlement was created to establish control over the region's salt lakes, an important source of valuable salt. In 1861 the settlement was renamed Pavlodar and incorporated as a town. Pavlodar's significance was due in large measure to the substantial agricultural and salt-producing industries that had developed there despite the town's relatively small population. Pavlodar's population numbered only about 8,000 in 1897. The name Pavlodar means The Gift of Paul, and was chosen to commemorate the birth of the [[Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9058809/Pavlodar|title=Pavlodar - Kazakhstan|website=britannica.com|access-date=13 April 2018}}</ref>

After 1955, the Soviet Government's [[Virgin Lands Campaign]] provided the impetus for the rapid growth and development of modern Pavlodar. Under the program, large numbers of young men and women from throughout the Soviet Union were relocated to the city; industrial and commercial activity was increased; and from the mid-1960s on, ''Pavlodar'' grew to become a major industrial centre of both the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]] and of the Soviet Union because of a major arms and armour manufacturing facility located in the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://caravanistan.com/kazakhstan/north/pavlodar/|title=Pavlodar travel guide|website=Caravanistan|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref>

On April 1, 2020, the city was subject to quarantine in an attempt to slow the spread of [[COVID-19 pandemic in Kazakhstan|COVID-19]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tengrinews.kz/kazakhstan_news/priem-vseh-reysov-prekraschaet-aeroport-nur-sultana-396724/|title = Прием всех рейсов прекращает аэропорт Нур-Султана|date = 31 March 2020}}</ref>{{update inline|date=December 2020}}

==Infrastructure==

===Public transportation===

==== Tram ====
[[File:Павлодар трамвай №148.jpg|thumb|Tram on Pavlodar street]]
Pavlodar has an 89&nbsp;km [[streetcar]] (tram) network, which began service in 1965 with, as of 2012, 20 regular and 3 special routes. The network has a 60% share of the local public transport market. However, its fleet of 115 trams is due to be replaced by 100 new trams produced locally by Polish manufacturer [[PESA SA]].<ref name="rg" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pavlodar-tramway.narod.ru/|title=Павлодарский трамвай :: Введение|website=pavlodar-tramway.narod.ru|access-date=13 April 2018}}</ref>

==== River Port ====
Currently, Pavlodar River Port JSC is operating — a large transport and industrial enterprise engaged in cargo transit, extraction and sale of river sand, sells and transports crushed stone, coal, performs work on cleaning hydrological facilities.

Pavlodar River Port JSC is one of the active ports on the Irtysh River.

The project of the modern Pavlodar river port was developed in 1955 by the design institute "Giprorechtrans" on the instructions of the Ministry of the River Fleet of the USSR. Since 1965, the former wharf of Pavlodar, by the decree of the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh SSR, was renamed the Pavlodar River Port. Since that moment, a river port equipped with the latest transshipment equipment has been functioning in Pavlodar. By the mid-1980s, the Pavlodar River Port had become the largest transshipment hub. At that time, the Pavlodar River Port was in first place among forty river ports of the Soviet Union in terms of cargo transshipment volumes. During this period, on average, about 6.5 million tons of various cargoes were transported per year. Since 2001, Pavlodar River Port JSC has been a private enterprise.

==== Bus service ====
There are 21 bus routes<ref>{{Cite web |title=Городские Автобусы в г. Павлодар по номерам маршрутов |url=https://www.24kz.ru/pavlodar/bus/ |website=24kz.ru}}</ref> and 13 minibus ([[marshrutka]]) routes<ref>{{Cite web |title=Городские Маршрутки в г.
