Many of his descendants and other [[First Nations in Canada|First Nations]] people live on the nearby [[Six Nations of the Grand River]] reserve south of Brantford; it is the most populous reserve in Canada.

Brantford is known as the "Telephone City" because the city's famous resident, [[Alexander Graham Bell]], invented the first [[telephone]] at his father's homestead, Melville House, now the [[Bell Homestead National Historic Site|Bell Homestead]], located in Tutela Heights south of the city. Brantford is also known as the birthplace and hometown of [[Wayne Gretzky]] and [[Phil Hartman]].

== History ==
[[File:Joseph Brant 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Thayendanegea or Joseph Brant, Mohawk military and political leader]]

The Iroquoian-speaking Attawandaron, known in English as the [[Neutral Nation]], lived in the Grand River valley area before the 17th century; their main village and seat of the chief, [[Kandoucho]], was identified by 19th-century historians as having been located on the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] where present-day Brantford developed. This community, like the rest of their settlements, was destroyed when the Iroquois declared war in 1650 over the fur trade and exterminated the Neutral nation.<ref>Reville, F. Douglas.

In 1784, Captain [[Joseph Brant]] and the [[Mohawk people]] of the Iroquois Confederacy left New York State for Canada.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Joseph Brant (Thayendanegea) {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/joseph-brant |access-date=2021-06-05 |website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca |archive-date=2021-06-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210605115032/https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/joseph-brant |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mohawk Language in the Workplace |url=https://snpolytechnic.com/sites/default/files/docs/resource/mohawk_in_the_workplace_booklet_2015-snp.pdf |website=Six Nations Polytechnic |publisher=Six Nations Polytechnic University |access-date=21 January 2024}}</ref> As a reward for their loyalty to the [[British Crown]], they were given a large land grant, referred to as the [[Haldimand Proclamation|Haldimand Tract]], on the Grand River. The original Mohawk settlement was on the south edge of the present-day city at a location favourable for landing canoes. Brant's crossing (or fording) of the river gave the original name to the area: Brant's ford The [[Glebe Farm 40B|Glebe Farm Indian Reserve]] exists at the original site today.

The area began to grow from a small settlement in the 1820s as the Hamilton and London Road was improved. By the 1830s, Brantford became a stop on the [[Underground Railroad]], and a sizable number of [[Black Canadians|runaway African-Americans]] settled in the town.<ref>{{cite web |title=- Grand River Branch – United Empire Loyalists' Association of Canada |url=http://www.grandriveruel.ca/Newsletter_Reprints/99v11n1African_Canadian.htm |website=www.grandriveruel.ca |access-date=11 February 2019 |archive-date=27 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201127013856/http://www.grandriveruel.ca/Newsletter_Reprints/99v11n1African_Canadian.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> From the 1830s to the 1860s – several hundred people of African descent settled in the area around Murray Street, and in [[Cainsville, Ontario|Cainsville]].

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Canadian government encouraged the education of First Nations children at [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential schools]], which were intended to teach them English and European-Canadian ways and assimilate them into the majority cultures. Such institutions in or near Brantford included the Thomas Indian School, [[Mohawk Institute Residential School]] (also known as Mohawk Manual Labour School and Mush Hole Indian Residential School), and the Haudenosaunee boarding school. Decades later and particularly since the late 20th century, numerous scholarly and artistic works have explored the detrimental effects of the schools in destroying Native cultures. Examples include Ronald James Douglas' graduate thesis titled ''Documenting Ethnic Cleansing in North America: Creating Unseen Tears'',<ref>{{cite news |title=Documenting ethnic cleansing in North America: Creating unseen tears (AAT 1482210) |author=Douglas, Ronald James |year=2010 |id={{ProQuest|757916758}}}}</ref> and the Legacy of Hope Foundation's online media collection: "Where are the Children?

Brantford generated controversy in 2010 when its city council expropriated and demolished 41 historic downtown buildings on the south side of its main street, Colborne Street. The buildings constituted one of the longest blocks of pre-Confederation architecture in Canada and included one of Ontario's first grocery stores and an early 1890s office of the [[Bell Canada|Bell Telephone Company of Canada]]. The decision was widely criticized by Ontario's heritage preservation community, however, the city argued it was needed for downtown renewal.<ref>{{cite news |last=Blaze Carlson |first=Katherine |title=Ontario city to demolish historic street, despite Ottawa's objection |url=https://torontosun.com/news/canada/ontario-city-seeks-to-demolish-historic-street-despite-ottawas-objection |access-date=February 8, 2022 |newspaper=Toronto Sun |date=June 8, 2010 |archive-date=February 8, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220208221214/https://torontosun.com/news/canada/ontario-city-seeks-to-demolish-historic-street-despite-ottawas-objection |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Wilkes |first=Jim |title=Demolition of historic buildings begins in Brantford |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/2010/06/08/demolition_of_historic_buildings_begins_in_brantford.html |access-date=February 8, 2022 |newspaper=The Toronto Star |date=June 8, 2010 |archive-date=February 8, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220208221212/https://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/2010/06/08/demolition_of_historic_buildings_begins_in_brantford.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The famed Mohawk Chief [[Joseph Brant]] (Thayendanega) led his people from the Mohawk Valley of New York State to Upper Canada after being allied with the British during the [[American Revolution]], where they lost their land holdings. A group of 400 settled in 1788 on the Grand River at Mohawk Village which would later become Brantford.<ref name="waynecook.com"/> Nearly a century later (1886), the Joseph Brant Memorial would be erected in [[Burlington, Ontario]] in honour of Brant and the Six Nations Confederacy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Brant19.html |title=Thayendanega (Joseph Brant) Historical Plaque |website=ontarioplaques.com |access-date=2017-04-07 |archive-date=2021-08-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210821103306/http://ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Brant19.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Mohawk Chapel]], built by the British Crown in 1785 for the [[Mohawk Nation|Mohawk]] and Iroquois people (Six Nations of the Grand River), was dedicated in 1788 as a reminder of the original agreements made with the British during the [[American Revolution]].<ref name="waynecook.com"/> 
In 1904 the chapel received Royal status by King [[Edward VII]] in memory of the longstanding alliance. Her Majesty's Royal Chapel of the Mohawks is an important reminder of the original agreements made with Queen Anne in 1710. It is still in use today as one of two royal Chapels in Canada and the oldest Protestant Church in the province.

The stone and brick Brant County Courthouse was built on land purchased from the Six Nations in 1852. The structure housed courtrooms, county offices, a law library and a gaol. During additions in the 1880s, the Greek Revival style, with Doric columns, was retained.<ref name="waynecook.com"/>

Among the most famed residents were [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and his family, who arrived in mid 1870 from Scotland while Bell was suffering from tuberculosis. They lived with Bell's father and mother, who had settled in a farmhouse on Tutela Heights (named after the First Nations tribe of the area<ref name="Patten-Bell">Patten, William; Bell, Alexander Melville.

== Economy ==
The [[invention of the telephone|electric telephone was invented here]] leading to the establishment of Canada's first telephone factory here in the 1870s. Brantford developed as an important Canadian industrial centre for the first half of the 20th century, and it was once the third-ranked Canadian city in terms of the cash value of manufactured goods exported.

The city developed at the deepest navigable point of the Grand River. Because of existing networks, it became a railroad hub of Southern Ontario. The combination of water and rail helped Brantford develop from a farming community into an industrial city with many blue-collar jobs based on the agriculture implementation industry. Major companies included S.C. Johnson Wax, Massey-Harris, Verity Plow, and the [[Cockshutt Plow Company]]. This industry, more than any other, provided the well-paying and steady employment that allowed Brantford to sustain economic growth through most of the 20th century.

By the 1980s and 1990s, Brantford's economy was in steady decline due to changes in heavy industry and its restructuring. Numerous companies suffered bankruptcies, such as [[White Farm Equipment]], [[Massey Ferguson]] (and its successor, Massey Combines Corporation), Koering-Waterous, Harding Carpets, and other manufacturers. The bankruptcies and closures of the businesses left thousands of people unemployed. As a consequence, it became one of the most economically depressed areas in the country, leaving a negative impact on the once-vibrant downtown.

An economic revival was prompted by the completion of the Brantford-to-[[Ancaster, Ontario|Ancaster]] section of [[Ontario Highway 403|Highway 403]] in 1997, bringing companies easy access to [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and [[Toronto]] and completing a direct route from [[Detroit]] to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. In 2004 [[Procter & Gamble]] and [[Ferrero SpA]] chose to locate in the city. Though Wescast Industries, Inc. recently closed its local foundry, its corporate headquarters will remain in Brantford. [[S. C. Johnson & Son|SC Johnson]] Canada has their headquarters and a manufacturing plant in Brantford, connected to the Canadian National network. Other companies that have their headquarters here include [[Gunther Mele]] and [[GreenMantra Technologies]]. On February 16, 2005, Brant, including Brantford, was added to the Greater [[Golden Horseshoe]] along with [[Haldimand County|Haldimand]] and [[Northumberland County, Ontario|Northumberland]] counties.

In February 2019, Brantford's unemployment rate stood at 4.6% – lower than Ontario's rate of 5.6%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a26?lang=eng&retrLang=eng&id=2820135&&pattern&stByVal=1&p1=1&p2=31&tabMode=dataTable&csid |title=CANSIM – 282-0135 – Labour force survey estimates (LFS), by census metropolitan area based on 2011 Census boundaries, 3-month moving average, seasonally adjusted and unadjusted |first=Government of Canada, Statistics |last=Canada |website=5.statcan.gc.ca |access-date=2017-01-07 |archive-date=2017-05-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517013613/http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a26?lang=eng&retrLang=eng&id=2820135&&pattern&stByVal=1&p1=1&p2=31&tabMode=dataTable&csid |url-status=live }}</ref>
