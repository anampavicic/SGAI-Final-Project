'''Gwangju'''{{efn|In the 19th century, Gwangju was sometimes spelled '''Koang-tsiou'''.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=390}}}} ({{Korean|hangul=광주}}; {{IPA|ko|kwaŋ.dʑu}}) is a [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|city]] in [[Gyeonggi]] Province, [[South Korea]], a suburb southeast of [[Seoul]].  The city is not to be confused with the much larger [[Gwangju|Gwangju Metropolitan City]], former capital of [[South Jeolla]] Province, or [[Guangzhou]], the city of [[Guangdong Province|Guangdong]], China in [[Hanja]].

==History==
''Bunwon-ri'' in Gwangju took an important role of ceramic production during the Kingdom of [[Joseon]]. There had official kilns and produced superb quality of [[Joseon white porcelain|white porcelain]]s for use at the royal court and to export to China.<ref>{{cite book|title=Atlas of World Art |author=John Onians |publisher=Laurence King Publishing |year=2004 |page=205p |isbn=978-1-85669-377-6 |quote=Government-sponsored kilns at punwon-ri, near Seoul, produced an exquisite and distinctive [[Joseon white porcelain]] for use at court and for export to China. Its undecorated cream-colored surfaces, and austere elegant shapes were thought to reflect a purity of mind and moral character appropriate for [[Neo-Confucian]] patrons.}}</ref>

In 1962, 4 myeons (townships) including 5 ris (villages) were incorporated to [[Seoul]].<ref>Law concerning Seoul metropolitan city, provinces, counties, districts and counties(1962. 11. 21.)</ref>

In 1973, 6 ris were separated and became a part of [[Seongnam]] city. In 1979, Gwangju-myeon was elevated to an eup. Gwangju county became a city in 2001.<ref>Establishment of new cities including Hwasung.(2000. 12. 20.)</ref>
