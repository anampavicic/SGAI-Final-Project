'''Rize''' ({{IPA|tr|ɾi'ze}}; {{langx|el|Ριζούντα}}; {{langx|lzz|რიზინი}}; {{lang-ka|რიზე}}; {{langx|hy|Ռիզե}}) is a coastal city in the eastern part of the [[Black Sea Region]] of Turkey. It is the seat of [[Rize Province]] and [[Rize District]].<ref name=il>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx İl Belediyesi], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory. Retrieved 30 January 2023.</ref> Its population is 119,828 (2021).<ref name=tuik>{{Cite web |title=Address-based population registration system (ADNKS) results dated 31 December 2021|url=https://www.tuik.gov.tr/indir/duyuru/favori_raporlar.xlsx |access-date=30 January 2023|publisher=[[TÜİK]]|language=tr |format=XLS}}</ref> Rize is a typical Turkish provincial capital with little in the way of nightlife or entertainment. Since the border with Georgia was opened in the early 1990s, the Black Sea coast road has been widened and the town is much wealthier than it used to be. Current Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]'s family has its roots in Rize and the [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan University|local university]] is named after him. The city is linked by road with [[Trabzon]] (41&nbsp;miles [66&nbsp;km] west), [[Hopa]] (55&nbsp;miles [88&nbsp;km] east on the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] border, and [[Erzurum]] (south). [[Rize–Artvin Airport]] started operating in 2022.

==Name==
The name comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ρίζα}} (riza) or Ριζαίον (Rizaion){{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}, meaning "mountain slopes" ({{lang|grc|ρίζα}} in Greek means root).<ref>[http://www.karalahana.com/karadeniz/rize_maddesi.htm Rize] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513094713/http://www.karalahana.com/karadeniz/rize_maddesi.htm |date=2008-05-13 }} article from [[Özhan Öztürk]], ''Encyclopedia of [[Black Sea]]'' (''Karadeniz Ansiklopedik Sözlük''), 2005</ref> In modern times, its Greek name was usually Ριζούντα (Rizunda). Its Latin forms are Rhizus and Rhizaeum, the latter of which is used in the [[Catholic Church]]'s list of [[titular see]]s as the name of [[bishopric]] of the town, which was once part of the late [[Roman province]] of [[Pontus Polemoniacus]]<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 959</ref>).

==History==
{{main article|Rize Province}}

[[Arrian]] was the first writer to mention Rize. In his [[Periplus of the Euxine Sea]],<ref>[http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/belge/2-2108/eski2yeni.html An Overview of Rize's History]</ref> he described it as a city founded at the mouth of the river of the same name, the [[Ancient Greece|ancient]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] ῾Ρίζιος ποταμός.<ref>Περίπλους τοῦ Εὐξείνου Πόντου</ref> Dated to 130–131AD and written as a letter to Roman Emperor [[Hadrian]], the work records how its author, the governor of [[Cappadocia]], made a tour of the Eastern [[Black Sea]] territories that formed part of his jurisdiction, first visiting the Roman Empire's Eastern [[Anatolia]]n frontier garrisons before pushing on to the Black Sea coast in the [[Trabzon]] (Trebizond) region.<ref>[[:wikisource:The Periplus of the Euxine Sea|The Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]. Oxford: sold by J. Cooke; and by Messrs. Cadell and Davies Strand, London. 1805. Note: Arrian only mentions the River Rhizius, not any settlement by that name. It is quoted as being to the east of the river Ophis after the rivers Psychrus and Calus.</ref>
The city of Rize formed part of the historic Georgian province of Chaneti ({{lang-ka|ჭანეთი}}).

From 1547, Chaneti province was incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]] and became a part of the ''[[Sanjak|sancak]]'' of [[Lazistan Sanjak|Lazistan]]. The city was claimed by the short-lived [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] between 1918 and 1920. On the basis of the 1921 [[Treaty of Kars]], Soviet Russia granted Rize to Turkey along with the other territories of [[Artvin]], [[Ardahan]], and [[Hopa]] ({{lang-ka|ხუფათი}}).

==Geography==
The city is built around a small bay on the [[Black Sea]] coast, on a narrow strip of flat land between the sea and the mountains behind. The coastal strip is being expanded with landfill and the city is expanding up the steep hillsides away from the coast. 

Rize is probably best known for its [[Rize tea|black tea]] which was introduced to the region in the 1940s and 1950s, changing the destiny of a region which was until then desperately poor.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.yeniansiklopedi.com/rize/ |title=Rize Çayı ve Rize kenti (tr) |access-date=2012-05-15 |archive-date=2020-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200523013513/http://www.yeniansiklopedi.com/rize/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>  The local tea research institute was founded in 1958 and other tea gardens can be seen all around the town. [[Tea]] is even planted in local gardens. Rize is a centre for processing and shipping locally grown [[Rize Tea]]. More recently [[kiwifruit]] plants have also been grown in Rize. Fishing remains another important local source of income.

Tourism to destinations in and around Rize is growing in importance.

{{More citations needed|Section|date=August 2023|talk=Climate}}
Rize has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa'', Trewartha: ''Cf''). However, as any mountainous region of Turkey, it is rich in climatic variety. The climate turns [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] (''Cfb'') on the hillsides, [[humid continental climate|continental]] (''Dfb/Dc'') and [[subarctic climate|subarctic]] (''Dfc/Eo'') on the mountain slopes and in the [[yaylak|yaylas]], the highlands and highland plateaus.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Beck |first1=Hylke E. |last2=Zimmermann |first2=Niklaus E. |last3=McVicar |first3=Tim R. |last4=Vergopolan |first4=Noemi |last5=Berg |first5=Alexis |last6=Wood |first6=Eric F. |date=2018-10-30 |title=Present and future Köppen-Geiger climate classification maps at 1-km resolution |journal=Scientific Data |language=en |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=180214 |doi=10.1038/sdata.2018.214 |issn=2052-4463|doi-access=free |pmid=30375988 |pmc=6207062 |bibcode=2018NatSD...580214B |hdl=20.500.11850/302311 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> When the [[Köppen climate classification]] was being created, the city centre had a borderline oceanic-humid subtropical climate, falling just under the {{convert|22|C|F|0}} threshold for the hottest month of the year, yet [[climate change]] and [[global warming]] have contributed to the city being classified as humid subtropical in recent decades.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Climate Explorer: Time series |url=https://climexp.knmi.nl/gettemp.cgi?id=someone@somewhere&WMO=17040.3&STATION=PAZAR_RIZE&extraargs= |access-date=2023-08-22 |website=climexp.knmi.nl}}</ref>

The city's climate is defined by mild temperate conditions, with warm summers, cool winters and heavy rainfall year-round with a maximum in late autumn (October to December). The city has relatively few sunshine hours, lower than many stereotypically cloudy locations in Western Europe. Snowfall is occasional, but can be very heavy once it starts. The water temperature, typical for the Black Sea coast, is never too warm or cold, fluctuating between {{convert|8|and|20|C|F|0}} throughout the year.

Historically, Rize grew [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s. However, weather destroyed the crops in the early 20th century, and the industry declined.<ref name=Prothero62>{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=W.G.|title=Armenia and Kurdistan|year=1920|publisher=H.M.

Rize's economic structure is primarily based on its geographic location since it is in a very mountainous location, making industrial development impractical. Given the lack of rail transit, most goods have to travel by truck or ship, which makes exporting and importing difficult. Rize's primary trading partner is [[Trabzon]], the most developed city of the northeast Black Sea region. Rize's main exports are agriculturally based; [[Rize tea|tea]] and kiwifruit are among its most popular commodities.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Rize|url=http://bologna.erdogan.edu.tr/index.php?kultur=en-US&page=rize|access-date=2021-10-08|website=Bologna Course Package, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan Üniversitesi}}</ref> In particular the state-owned tea company [[Çaykur]] is based in Rize.

==Education==
Rize University was founded in 2006. Its name was changed to [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan University]] in 2011.

==Culture==
[[Rize Castle]] is a partly ruined medieval castle to the southwest of the city centre.

==Sports==
Rize's sports venues include [[Rize Atatürk Stadium]], [[Yeni Rize Şehir Stadı]] and Rize Sports Complex consisting of [[Rize Sports Hall]] and Rize Indoor Swimming Pool.

The football team of [[Çaykur Rizespor]] play in the [[Süper Lig]]. [[Pazarspor]] football team compete in the [[TFF Third League]].
