'''Quilpué''' is a [[List of cities in Chile|city]] and [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the [[Marga Marga Province]] in central [[Chile]]'s [[Valparaíso Region]]. It is part of the [[Greater Valparaíso]] [[metropolitan area]].  It is widely known as "City of the Sun" ({{Lang|es|Ciudad del Sol}}) and the urban part of it also comprises the town of El Belloto, an area that showed rapid growth in the late 1990s.

==Etymology==
There are various theories about the origin of the word {{Lang|es|Quilpué}}. According to some, ''{{Lang|es|Quilpué}}'' means {{Gloss|place where there are pigeons}}, arguing that pigeons were found abundantly in the area and that the name derives from the aboriginal words {{Lang|arn|cullpo}} {{Gloss|ground dove}} and {{Lang|arn|hue}} {{Gloss|place}}. Other authors suggest that it means {{Gloss|place of the stone lancet}}, because the [[Picunche|Picunches]] (the indigenous [[Mapuche]] people) were experts in the manufacture of these items that were used for medical procedures.  Numbers of these stone lancets have been found in the area's archaeological sites, as well as the original formation which was quarried for them.

==Tourism==
[[File:Los Pinos, Quilpué.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Los Pinos, a residential sector of Quilpué]]
Quilpué is called ''{{Lang|es|Ciudad del Sol}}'' because compared to [[Valparaíso]], it has many more sunny days a year. It has a [[Valparaíso Metro|metropolitan train]], highway and bus connections to [[Viña del Mar]] and [[Valparaíso]] to the coast, and also towards inland cities. Since housing is cheaper in Quilpué, thousands of people [[Commuting|commute]] every day to the coastal cities.

Quilpué is connected to [[Santiago]] through the [[Chile Route 68|Route 68]], with an estimated travel time of 1.15h by car and 1.30h by inter-regional bus services, that departs and arrive mostly from [[Santiago Metro|Pajaritos metro and interchange station]], west of the national capital.

Local attractions include a zoo (the only one in the Valparaíso Region), and the rural towns of Colliguay and the Marga-Marga Valley, both with facilities for camping and hiking.
