Located in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands region]] of England, Birmingham is considered to be the social, cultural, financial and commercial centre of the [[Midlands]].

Distinctively, Birmingham only has small rivers flowing through it, mainly the [[River Tame, West Midlands|River Tame]] and its tributaries [[River Rea]] and [[River Cole, West Midlands|River Cole]] – one of the closest main rivers is the [[River Severn|Severn]], approximately {{convert|20|mile}} west of [[Birmingham city centre|the city centre]]. The city does however have numerous [[canals]], collectively named the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations]].<ref name="can"/>

Historically a [[market town]] in [[Warwickshire]] in the medieval period, Birmingham grew during the 18th century during the [[Midlands Enlightenment]] and during the [[Industrial Revolution]], which saw advances in science, technology and economic development, producing a series of innovations that laid many of the foundations of modern [[industrial society]].<ref name="indsoc">{{harvnb|Uglow|2011|pp=iv, 860–861}}; {{harvnb|Jones|2008|pp=14, 19, 71, 82–83, 231–232}}</ref> By 1791, it was being hailed as "the first manufacturing town in the world".<ref>{{harvnb|Hopkins|1989|p=26}}</ref> Birmingham's distinctive economic profile, with thousands of small workshops practising a wide variety of specialised and highly skilled trades, encouraged exceptional levels of creativity and innovation; this provided an economic base for prosperity that was to last into the final quarter of the 20th century. The [[Watt steam engine]] was invented in Birmingham.<ref>{{harvnb|Berg|1991|pp=174, 184}}; {{cite book |last=Jacobs |first=Jane |title=The economy of cities |url=https://archive.org/details/economyofcities00jacorich |url-access=limited |year=1969 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |oclc=5585 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/economyofcities00jacorich/page/86 86]–89}}</ref>

The resulting high level of [[social mobility]] also fostered a culture of [[political radicalism]] which, under leaders from [[Thomas Attwood (economist)|Thomas Attwood]] to [[Joseph Chamberlain]], was to give it a political influence unparalleled in Britain outside London and a pivotal role in the development of British democracy.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2005|loc=jacket|quote=Such a firm basis of local support enabled political leaders, from Thomas Attwood to Neville Chamberlain, to exert leverage in national politics.

==Toponymy==

The name ''Birmingham'' comes from the [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|Beormingahām}},<ref>{{Harvnb|Gelling|1956|p=14}}</ref> meaning the home or settlement of the {{lang|ang|[[Beormingas]]}} – a tribe or clan whose name means 'Beorma's people' and which may have formed an early unit of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] administration.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gelling|1992|p=140}}</ref> [[Beorma]], after whom the tribe was named, could have been its leader at the time of the Anglo-Saxon settlement, a shared ancestor, or a mythical tribal figurehead. Place names ending in {{lang|ang|-ingahām}} are characteristic of primary settlements established during the early phases of Anglo-Saxon colonisation of an area, suggesting that Birmingham was probably in existence by the early 7th century at the latest.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gelling|1956|pp=14–15}}</ref> Surrounding settlements with names ending in {{lang|ang|-tūn}} ('farm'), {{lang|ang|-lēah}} ('woodland clearing'), {{lang|ang|-worð}} ('enclosure') and {{lang|ang|-field}} ('open ground') are likely to be secondary settlements created by the later expansion of the Anglo-Saxon population,<ref>{{Harvnb|Thorpe|1950|p=106}}</ref> in some cases possibly on earlier [[Britons (historical)|British]] sites.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bassett|2000|p=7}}</ref>

The development of Birmingham into a significant urban and commercial centre began in 1166, when the [[Lord of the Manor]] Peter de Bermingham obtained a charter to hold a market at [[Birmingham Manor House|his castle]], and followed this with the creation of a planned [[market town]] and [[seigneurial borough]] within his ''[[demesne]]'' or manorial estate, around the site that became the [[Bull Ring, Birmingham|Bull Ring]].<ref>{{harvnb|Leather|2001|p=9}}; {{cite book |last=Demidowicz |first=George |title=Medieval Birmingham: the borough rentals of 1296 and 1344-5 |series=Dugdale Society Occasional Papers |year=2008 |publisher=The Dugdale Society, in association with the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust |location=Stratford-upon-Avon |isbn=978-0-85220-090-2 |page=31}}</ref> This established Birmingham as the primary commercial centre for the Birmingham Plateau at a time when the area's economy was expanding rapidly, with population growth nationally leading to the clearance, cultivation and settlement of previously marginal land.<ref>{{harvnb|Leather|2001|p=9}}; {{harvnb|Holt|1986|pp=4–6}}</ref> Within a century of the charter Birmingham had grown into a prosperous urban centre of merchants and craftsmen.<ref>{{harvnb|Holt|1986|p=4}}</ref> By 1327 it was the third-largest town in Warwickshire,<ref name="Leather 2001 12">{{harvnb|Leather|2001|p=12}}</ref> a position it would retain for the next 200 years.

===Early modern===
The principal governing institutions of medieval Birmingham – including the [[Guild of the Holy Cross (Birmingham)|Guild of the Holy Cross]] and the lordship of the [[de Birmingham family]] – collapsed between 1536 and 1547,<ref>{{harvnb|Leather|2001|pp=14–16}}</ref> leaving the town with an unusually high degree of social and economic freedom and initiating a period of transition and growth.<ref>{{harvnb|Leather|2001|p=14}}; {{harvnb|Jones|2008|p=62}}; {{Harvnb|Uglow|2011|p=31}}</ref>

The importance of the manufacture of [[iron]] goods to Birmingham's economy was recognised as early as 1538, and grew rapidly as the century progressed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holt|1986|p=18}}</ref> Equally significant was the town's emerging role as a centre for the [[ironmongers|iron merchants]] who organised finance, supplied raw materials and traded and marketed the industry's products.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holt|1986|p=20}}</ref> By the 1600s Birmingham formed the commercial hub of a network of [[forge]]s and [[Industrial furnace|furnaces]] stretching from [[South Wales]] to [[Cheshire]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Hopkins|1989|p=4}}</ref> and its merchants were selling finished manufactured goods as far afield as the [[West Indies]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Pelham |first=R.

===Industrial Revolution===
[[File:Matthew Boulton - Carl Frederik von Breda.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Matthew Boulton]], a prominent early industrialist]]

Birmingham's explosive industrial expansion started earlier than that of the [[Mill town|textile-manufacturing towns]] of the [[North of England]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Jones|2008|p=34}}; {{Harvnb|Berg|1991|pp=180, 196}}; {{Harvnb|Hopkins|1989|pp=20–22}}; {{Harvnb|Ward|2005|p=2}}</ref> and was driven by different factors. Instead of the [[economies of scale]] of a low-paid, unskilled workforce producing a single bulk [[commodity]] such as cotton or wool in large, mechanised units of production, Birmingham's industrial development was built on the adaptability and creativity of a highly paid workforce with a strong [[division of labour]], practising a broad variety of skilled specialist trades and producing a constantly diversifying range of products, in a highly [[entrepreneurial]] economy of small, often self-owned workshops.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hopkins|1989|pp=6, 9, 11, 34–36, 55–57}}; {{Harvnb|Berg|1991|pp=174, 194}}; {{Harvnb|Jones|2008|p=19}}</ref> This led to exceptional levels of inventiveness: between 1760 and 1850 – the core years of the Industrial Revolution – Birmingham residents registered over three times as many [[patent]]s as those of any other British town or city.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jones|2008|p=40}}; {{Harvnb|Berg|1991|p=184}}</ref>

The demand for [[capital (economics)|capital]] to feed rapid economic expansion also saw Birmingham grow into a major [[financial centre]] with extensive international connections.<ref name="Berg 1991 183">{{Harvnb|Berg|1991|p=183}}</ref> [[Lloyds Bank]] was founded in the town in 1765,<ref>{{Harvnb|Hopkins|1989|pp=30–31}}</ref> and [[Ketley's Building Society]], the world's first [[building society]], in 1775.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsa.org.uk/consumer/factsheets/100009.htm |title=The History of Building Societies |access-date=20 April 2014 |last=Rex |first=Simon |date=20 April 2010 |publisher=Building Societies Association |archive-date=23 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823203217/http://www.bsa.org.uk/consumer/factsheets/100009.htm |url-status=dead}}</ref> By 1800 the West Midlands had more banking offices per head than any other region in Britain, including London.<ref name="Berg 1991 183"/>

Birmingham rose to national political prominence in the campaign for political reform in the early 19th century, with [[Thomas Attwood (economist)|Thomas Attwood]] and the [[Birmingham Political Union]] bringing the country to the brink of civil war during the [[Days of May]] that preceded the passing of the [[Great Reform Act]] in 1832.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hilton |first=Boyd |year=2006 |title=A Mad, Bad, and Dangerous People?: England, 1783–1846 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-822830-9 |pages=426–427 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D37VByMZSaUC |access-date=7 January 2009}}</ref> The Union's meetings on [[Newhall Street|Newhall Hill]] in 1831 and 1832 were the largest political assemblies Britain had ever seen.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Flick |first=Carlos T. |title=Thomas Attwood, Francis Place, and the Agitation for British Parliamentary Reform |journal=The Huntington Library Quarterly |volume=34 |issue=4 |date=August 1971 |publisher=University of California Press |page=359 |doi=10.2307/3816950 |jstor=3816950}}</ref> [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]], who drafted the Act, wrote that "the country owed Reform to Birmingham, and its salvation from revolution".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Briggs |first=Asa |author-link=Asa Briggs |title=Thomas Attwood and the Economic Background of the Birmingham Political Union |journal=Cambridge Historical Journal |volume=9 |issue=2 |year=1948 |pages=190–216 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |doi=10.1017/S1474691300001992 |jstor=3020620}}</ref> This reputation for having "shaken the fabric of privilege to its base" in 1832 led [[John Bright]] to make Birmingham the platform for his successful campaign for the [[1867 Reform Act|Second Reform Act]] of 1867, which extended voting rights to the urban working class.<ref>{{Harvnb|Briggs|1965|pp=189–190}}; {{Harvnb|Ward|2005|pp=57–59}}</ref>

The original [[Charter of Incorporation]], dated 31 October 1838, was received in Birmingham on 1 November, then read in the [[Birmingham Town Hall|Town Hall]] on 5 November with elections for the first [[Birmingham Town Council]] being held on 26 December.

On 5 September 2023 Birmingham city council issued a Section 114 notice to say that it could not meet its financial commitments. Effectively this meant the council was bankrupt. A major contributing factor is a £1.1b sum that has been paid out since 2010, for equal pay claims. There is still a bill for £760m, increasing by £14m a month. There are also problems with a new IT system that was projected to cost £19m but is now closer to £100m. In addition there is a projected £87m deficit for the financial year 23/24.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Madden |first1=Sophie |title=What is happening in 'bankrupt' Birmingham? |work=BBC News |date=6 September 2023 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-66730165 |access-date=11 September 2023}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{further|List of areas of Birmingham}}
Birmingham is located in the centre of the [[West Midlands region]] of England on the [[Birmingham Plateau]] – an area of relatively high ground, ranging between {{convert|500|and|1,000|ft|m|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and crossed by Britain's main north–south [[water divide|watershed]] between the basins of the Rivers [[River Severn|Severn]] and [[River Trent|Trent]]. To the immediate south west of the city lie the [[Lickey Hills]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/lickey |title=Lickey Hills Country Park |publisher=Birmingham City Council |access-date=13 January 2010}} {{Dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref> [[Clent Hills]] and [[Walton Hill]], which reach {{convert|1033|ft|m|0}} and have extensive views over the city. Birmingham is drained only by minor rivers and brooks, primarily the [[River Tame, West Midlands|River Tame]] and its tributaries the [[River Cole, West Midlands|Cole]] and the [[River Rea|Rea]]. Birmingham is located significantly inland, and its nearest body of sea is at [[Liverpool Bay]]. It lies at the same latitude as [[Lowestoft]], Britain's easternmost settlement; it is therefore much more proximate to the western coast of Wales, at [[Cardigan Bay]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Birmingham's City Structure |url=https://www.internetgeography.net/topics/birminghams-city-structure/ |access-date=2 January 2024 |website=Internet Geography |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=The Geography of Birmingham |url=http://billdargue.jimdofree.com/glossary-brief-histories/the-geography-of-birmingham/ |access-date=2 January 2024 |website=History of Birmingham Places A to Y |language=en-US}}</ref>{{wide image|Panorama of Birmingham.jpg|800px|Cityscape}}The City of Birmingham forms a [[conurbation]] with the borough of [[Metropolitan Borough of Solihull|Solihull]] to the south east, and with the city of [[Wolverhampton]] and the industrial towns of the [[Black Country]] to the north west, which form the [[West Midlands Built-up Area]] covering {{convert|59972|ha|km2 sqmi|abbr=on|0}}.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}} Surrounding this is [[Birmingham metropolitan area|Birmingham's metropolitan area]] – the area to which it is closely economically tied through [[commuting]] – which includes the town of [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]] and the city of [[Lichfield]] in Staffordshire to the north; the city of [[Coventry]] and the towns of [[Nuneaton]], [[Bedworth, Warwickshire|Bedworth]], [[Whitnash, Warwickshire|Whitnash]], [[Kenilworth, Warwickshire|Kenilworth]], Rugby, [[Atherstone, Warwickshire|Atherstone]], [[Coleshill, Warwickshire|Coleshill]], [[Warwick]] and [[Leamington Spa]] to the east in Warwickshire and the Worcestershire towns of [[Redditch]] and [[Bromsgrove]] to the south west.<ref name="espon">{{cite web |url=http://www.espon.eu/export/sites/default/Documents/Projects/ESPON2006Projects/StudiesScientificSupportProjects/UrbanFunctions/fr-1.4.3_April2007-final.pdf |title=British urban pattern: population data |access-date=19 September 2010 |date=March 2007 |pages=119–120 |work=ESPON project 1.4.3 Study on Urban Functions |publisher=European Union – European Spatial Planning Observation Network |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924002318/http://www.espon.eu/export/sites/default/Documents/Projects/ESPON2006Projects/StudiesScientificSupportProjects/UrbanFunctions/fr-1.4.3_April2007-final.pdf |archive-date=24 September 2015}}</ref>

As the crow flies, Birmingham lies approximately {{convert|100|mile}} north-west of [[London]], {{convert|85|mile}} north-east of the Welsh capital [[Cardiff]], {{convert|45|mile}} south-west of [[Nottingham]], {{convert|70|mile}} south of [[Manchester]], and {{convert|75|mile}} north-north-east of [[Bristol]].

Much of the area now occupied by the city was originally a northern reach of the ancient [[Forest of Arden]] and the city remains relatively densely covered by [[oak]] in a large number of districts such as [[Moseley]], [[Saltley]], [[Yardley, Birmingham|Yardley]], [[Stirchley, West Midlands|Stirchley]] and [[Hockley, Birmingham|Hockley]]. These places, with names ending in "-ley", deriving from [[Old English]] ''-{{lang|ang|lēah}}'' meaning "woodland clearing", are named after the former forest.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hooke |first=Della |editor=Brown, Michelle P. |editor2=Farr, Carol Ann |title=Mercia: an Anglo-Saxon kingdom in Europe |year=2005 |publisher=Continuum |isbn=0-8264-7765-8 |page=167 |chapter=Mercia: Landscape and Environment |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H8Ke9acHFm4C&pg=PA167}}</ref>

Birmingham is dominated by the Birmingham Fault, which runs diagonally through the city from the Lickey Hills in the south west, passing through Edgbaston and the Bull Ring, to [[Erdington]] and Sutton Coldfield in the north east.<ref name=JPS/> To the south and east of the fault the ground is largely softer [[Mercia Mudstone Group|Mercia Mudstone]], interspersed with beds of [[Bunter (geology)|Bunter pebbles]] and crossed by the valleys of the Rivers Tame, Rea and Cole and their tributaries.<ref>{{cite book |first=Victor |last=Skipp |author-link=Victor Skipp |title=The History of Greater Birmingham – down to 1830 |page=15 |year=1987 |publisher=V.

Extreme weather is rare, but the city has been known to experience [[tornado]]es. On 14 June 1931, an extremely damaging T6/F3 tornado struck the city, carving an 11-mile damage path through Hollywood, Hall Green, Sparkbrook, Tyseley, Greet and Small Heath, causing extensive damage and killing 1 woman. On 23 November 1981, during a record-breaking [[1981 United Kingdom tornado outbreak|nationwide tornado outbreak]], two tornadoes touched down within the Birmingham city limits – in Erdington and [[Selly Oak]] – with six tornadoes touching down within the boundaries of the wider [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] county.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eswd.eu/cgi-bin/eswd.cgi |title=European Severe Weather Database |first=European Severe Storms |last=Laboratory |website=www.eswd.eu}}</ref> More recently, a destructive T6/F3 tornado occurred in [[Birmingham Tornado (UK)|July 2005]] in the south of the city, damaging homes and businesses in the area. The tornado took an almost parallel path to that of the 1931 tornado.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/tornado.bcc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618215923/http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/tornado.bcc |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 June 2008 |title=Birmingham Tornado 2005 |publisher=Birmingham City Council |access-date=13 January 2010}}</ref> Notable tornadoes have also struck the city in 1923, 1946, 1951, 1998 and 1999, most of which being of T2-T4/F1-F2 intensity.

Birmingham is chiefly a product of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries; its growth began during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Consequently, relatively few buildings survive from its earlier history and those that do are protected. There are 1,946 [[listed building]]s in [[Listed buildings in Birmingham|Birmingham]] and thirteen [[scheduled ancient monument]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/ELibrary?E_LIBRARY_ID=75&a=1083070309470 |title=Schedule of Nationally Listed Buildings of Historic Interest in Birmingham |publisher=Birmingham City Council Planning Department |access-date=7 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930235342/http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/ELibrary?E_LIBRARY_ID=75&a=1083070309470 |archive-date=30 September 2007}}</ref> Birmingham City Council also operate a locally listing scheme for buildings that do not fully meet the criteria for statutorily listed status.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/info/20042/listed_buildings/38/what_is_a_locally_listed_building |title=What is a locally listed building? |website=Birmingham City Council |access-date=7 January 2024}}</ref>

Traces of [[medieval]] Birmingham can be seen in the oldest churches, notably the original [[parish church]], [[St Martin in the Bull Ring]].

In a partial reaction against the Manzoni years, Birmingham City Council is demolishing some of the brutalist buildings like the Central Library and has an extensive tower block demolition and renovation programme.

Highrise development has slowed since the 1970s and mainly in recent years because of enforcements imposed by the [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|Civil Aviation Authority]] on the heights of buildings as they could affect aircraft from the Airport (e.g. [[Beetham Tower, Birmingham|Beetham Tower]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ITEM_ID=13971&CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&MENU_ID=1453 |title=Birmingham High Places document |publisher=Birmingham City Council |access-date=7 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609045359/http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ITEM_ID=13971&CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&MENU_ID=1453 |archive-date=9 June 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Demonymy and identity===

People from Birmingham are called [[Brummie dialect|Brummie]]s, a term derived from the city's nickname of "Brum", which originates from the city's old name, [[Brummagem]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-bru2.htm |title=Brummagem |publisher=Worldwidewords.com |date=13 December 2003 |access-date=7 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=William |last=Hutton |title=An History of Birmingham |year=1783}}</ref> The [[Brummie dialect|Brummie]] [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] and [[dialect]] are particularly distinctive.

There is currently no underground system in Birmingham; it is the largest city in Europe not to have one. In recent years, ideas of an underground system have started to appear, but none so far have been planned in earnest primarily due to the ongoing expansion of the West Midlands Metro tram network being viewed as a higher priority.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://centro.journalistpresslounge.com/centro/news/index.cfm/fuseaction/details/id/2F2640E8-1109-B563-070D7BCF5BCAB3CB/cnt/1/ref/main/type/News%20releases/ses/1.cfm |title=Council support for Midland Metro expansion follows outcome of Birmingham underground study |publisher=Centro |date=25 October 2005 |access-date=18 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831041630/http://centro.journalistpresslounge.com/centro/news/index.cfm/fuseaction/details/id/2F2640E8-1109-B563-070D7BCF5BCAB3CB/cnt/1/ref/main/type/News%20releases/ses/1.cfm |archive-date=31 August 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Tram====
Historically, Birmingham had a substantial [[tram]] system operated by [[Birmingham Corporation Tramways]] which was closed in 1953. In 1999, trams returned to the city with the [[West Midlands Metro]] (formerly known as the ''Midland Metro'') which operates services to the city of [[Wolverhampton]]. Since 2015–2016, after extension work, the tram network runs in the streets of central Birmingham, for the first time since 1953; further expansions of the West Midlands Metro system are underway with extensions and new lines being constructed.<ref name="2017 WMtt"/>

====Bus and coach====
