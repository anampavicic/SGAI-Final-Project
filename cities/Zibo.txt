The Zibo area was the centre of the ancient [[State of Qi]], whose capital [[Ancient Linzi|Linzi]] was the most populous city in China at its peak. [[Pu Songling]], a well-known writer of the [[Qing dynasty]], is one of the most famous people from Zibo. As the birthplace of Qi culture, Zibo is a notable tourist city.

[[Manufacturing]] holds an important place of the city's economy, particularly ceramics manufacturing. Other key industries include the [[petrochemical industry]], pharmaceuticals, metallurgy, construction materials, machinery and textiles. New industries and high-technology industries, such new materials, fine chemicals, electronics, IT, and biopharmaceutics are also developing rapidly.

According to the 2007-08 Global City Competitiveness Report released by the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]], Zibo was among the top 20 cities in the world in terms of fast economic growth between 2001 and 2005.<ref name="zibo01205e">[http://news.sohu.com/20080812/n258775863.shtml "15 out of top 20 cities which enjoy the fastest economic growth are in China"], Sohu news, Guangzhou Daily Aug.12,08.</ref> According to the ''Oriental Outlook Magazine'', Zibo ranks No. 1 on the list of cities that have reasonable real estate prices in China, also ranking No. 2 on the list of cities with good public security in China in 2008.<ref name="ziboestate">[http://gzdaily.dayoo.com/html/2009-07/15/content_633705.htm 2008 Top Happiest Cities in China] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719155136/http://gzdaily.dayoo.com/html/2009-07/15/content_633705.htm |date=19 July 2009 }}, Guangzhou Daily, Retrieved on Apr.16,09.</ref> In 2009, the city received the award of "Best 10 Harmonious Cities that enjoy Sustainable Development in China".<ref name="ziboharmony">[http://news.sdfdc.com/html/2009-09-27/1254016315420.htm 2009 Best 10 Harmonious Cities that enjoy Sustainable Development in China] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130050144/http://news.sdfdc.com/html/2009-09-27/1254016315420.htm |date=30 January 2011 }}, www.sdfdc.com, Retrieved on Sep.29,09.</ref>

==History==
[[file:Linzi_sewer_2010_06_06.jpg|thumb|right|Remains of city sewer passing underneath the former city wall]]
[[File:Sacrificial horsepit linzi 2010 06 06.jpg|thumb|right|Sacrificial horses in the tomb of [[Duke Jing of Qi]], discovered in Linzi]]

The remains of three major [[Neolithic]] cultures in ancient China, [[Beixin culture]], [[Dawenkou culture]], and [[Longshan culture]] have been found in Zibo. [[Ancient Linzi]], located in present-day Zibo, was the capital of the ancient [[Qi (state)|State of Qi]], a powerful state during the [[Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn]] and the [[Warring States period|Warring States]] periods, over 2,000 years ago. In 7th century BC, [[Duke Huan of Qi]], ruler of Qi, appointed [[Guan Zhong]], thinker and economist, as his prime minister, and adopted Guan's thoughts and policies to administer his country, develop the economy and develop relations with other states. The measures greatly strengthened the country, making its capital one of the most prosperous in ancient China. Zibo is rich in cultural and historical sites, and is referred to as the "Underground Museum". In Linzi, the ruins of the ancient Qi city, as well as other famous cultural relics and historic sites, have been discovered and unearthed. The ancient city of Qi was one of the first places in China that was assigned to be a "cultural relics site" and protected.

Zibo made significant contributions to the formation and prosperity of the [[Silk Road]]. Zibo was one of the biggest suppliers of silk products. Zhoucun, one of the townships in Zibo, was considered one of the four 'dry ports' alongside [[Foshan]], [[Jingdezhen]], and [[Zhuxian, Henan|Zhuxian]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} The major trade streets such as 'Dajie', 'Sishijie', 'Yinzijie' are well preserved to this date.

In 2004, [[FIFA]] president [[Sepp Blatter]] visited Zibo to celebrate [[FIFA]]'s 100th anniversary. [[FIFA]] has since then recognized the city as the birthplace of [[football (soccer)|football]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=tian |first=mai |date=2014-07-15 |title=2004年7月15日 布拉特宣布世界足球起源于中国 |trans-title=July 15, 2004 Blatter Declares World Football Originated in China |url=http://www.china.com.cn/v/cul/2014-07/15/content_32955833.htm |access-date=2024-05-12 |website=v.china.com.cn |language=zh}}</ref>

Zibo City was established in 1954. The name came from a combination of the prefecture's two major urban areas, Zichuan and Boshan.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-05-12 |title=淄博历史沿革 |trans-title=Zibo History |url=http://www.zbsbmj.gov.cn/lsyg/index.jhtml |website=淄博市保密局 |language=zh}}</ref>

==Administrative divisions==
The [[prefecture-level city]] of Zibo administers eight [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#County level|county-level divisions]], including five [[District of China|districts]] and three [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]].

[[File:淄川馬鞍山2009.jpg|thumb|right|Saddle Mountain, one of the highest mountains in Zibo]]
Zibo is located near the center of Shandong Province, neighboring [[Mt. Tai]] in the south and backing the [[Yellow River]] in the north. Toward the east are the coastal cities of [[Qingdao]], [[Yantai]], and [[Weihai]]. The capital of Shandong, [[Jinan]] is to its west.
