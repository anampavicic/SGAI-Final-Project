'''Thousand Oaks''' is the second-largest city in [[Ventura County, California]], located in the northwestern part of [[Greater Los Angeles]]. Approximately {{convert|15|mi|km}} from the city of Los Angeles and {{convert|40|mi|km}} from [[Downtown Los Angeles]], it is named after the many [[oak]] trees present in the area.

The city forms the central populated core of the [[Conejo Valley]]. Thousand Oaks was incorporated in 1964 and has since expanded to the west and east. Two-thirds of the master-planned community surrounding [[Westlake Lake|Westlake]] and most of [[Newbury Park, California|Newbury Park]] were annexed by the city during the late 1960s and 1970s. The [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]]–Ventura County line forms the city's eastern border with the city of [[Westlake Village, California|Westlake Village]]. The population was 126,966 at the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]], up from 126,683 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].<ref name="quif"/>

== History ==
===Etymology===
One of the earliest names used for the area was Conejo Mountain Valley, as used by the founder of Newbury Park, [[Egbert Starr Newbury]], in the 1870s.<ref>Begun, Ruthanne (2006). ''The Newburys of Newbury Park''. Conejo Valley Historical Society. Page 42. {{ISBN|9780972523332}}.</ref> During the 1920s, today's Thousand Oaks was home to 100 residents. In the 1920s came talks of coming up with a name for the specific area of Thousand Oaks. A local name contest was held, where 14-year-old Bobby Harrington's name suggestion won: Thousand Oaks.<ref>Chalquist, Craig (2008).

When the city was incorporated in 1964, the [[Janss Investment Company|Janss Corporation]] suggested the name Conejo City (City of Conejo). A petition was signed by enough residents to put Thousand Oaks on the ballot. An overwhelming majority—87%—of the city's 19,000 residents voted for the name Thousand Oaks during the September 29, 1964, election.<ref name="toacorn.com"/><ref name="conejovalleyguide">{{cite web|url=https://www.conejovalleyguide.com/welcome/voters-chose-to-incorporate-the-city-of-thousand-oaks|title=Voters Chose to Incorporate the City of Thousand Oaks Over the City of Conejo in a September 29, 1964 Special Election – Conejo Valley Guide {{pipe}} Conejo Valley Events|website=conejovalleyguide.com|access-date=November 28, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001075016/https://www.conejovalleyguide.com/welcome/voters-chose-to-incorporate-the-city-of-thousand-oaks|archive-date=October 1, 2017}}</ref>

From 1804 to 1848, Thousand Oaks was part of [[Alta California]], which originally was a Spanish [[polity]] in North America. It was the Spaniards who first named it Conejo Valley, or Valley of Rabbits. The [[Spaniards]] and indigenous [[Chumash people|Chumash]] clashed numerous times in disputes over land.<ref name="Maulhardt, Jeffrey Wayne 2010 Page 7">Maulhardt, Jeffrey Wayne (2010). ''Conejo Valley''. Arcadia Publishing. Page 7. {{ISBN|9780738580395}}.</ref> Conejo Valley was given the name El Rancho Conejo in 1803. This year, Jose Polanco and Ignacio Rodriguez were granted El Rancho Conejo by Governor [[José Joaquín de Arrillaga]] of Alta California. The land contained 48,671.56 acres. [[Rancho El Conejo|El Conejo]] was just one of two land grants in what became [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]], the other being [[Rancho Simi]].<ref name="Maulhardt, Jeffrey Wayne 2010 Page 7"/>

As a result of the [[Mexican War of Independence]] in 1822, Alta California became a Mexican territory. In 1822, Captain [[José de la Guerra y Noriega]] filed Conejo Valley as part of the [[Mexican land grant]]. It remained a part of Mexico until the short-lived [[California Republic]] was established in 1846. It became a part of the U.S. after California gained statehood in 1850. The valley was now known as Rancho El Conejo.<ref name="Brien, Tricia 2017">O'Brien, Tricia (2017). ''Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village''. Arcadia Publishing. Page 7. {{ISBN|9781467125697}}.</ref> The ranch period began when the de la Guerra family sold thousands of acres through the 1860s and early 1870s.<ref name="Maulhardt, Jeffrey Wayne 2010 Page 7"/>

Two men owned most of Conejo Valley in the 1870s: John Edwards, who came from [[Wales]] in 1849, and Howard Mills, who came from [[Minnesota]] in 1870. While Edwards owned most of present-day Thousand Oaks and Newbury Park, Mills owned most of [[Westlake Village, California|Westlake Village]] and [[Hidden Valley, Ventura County, California|Hidden Valley]]. Edwards' home was located on an acre of land where [[The Oaks (Thousand Oaks, California)|The Oaks Mall]] currently is located, while Mills built his home where [[Westlake Lake]] sits today. The third person to buy former [[Rancho El Conejo]] land was [[Egbert Starr Newbury]]. He bought 2,259 acres of land here in 1874, land which stretched from Old Town Thousand Oaks and into today's Newbury Park.<ref>Bidwell, Carol A. (1989). ''The Conejo Valley: Old and New Frontiers''. Windsor Publications. Page 23. {{ISBN|9780897812993}}.</ref> He later established the valley's first post office in 1875: [[Newbury Park Post Office]].<ref>Maulhardt, Jeffrey Wayne (2010).

===Norwegian Colony===
{{Further|Norwegian Colony}}
Thousand Oaks was home to a [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] community in the late 1890s and early 1900s, known as Norwegian Colony. Norwegian settlers were among the first to settle in Conejo Valley. The Norwegian Colony was located at today's intersection of Moorpark- and Olsen Roads, now home to [[California Lutheran University]] and surrounding areas.

The Olsen family lost seven of their ten children, while Ole Anderson, Lars Pederson, and George Hansen all died in 1901 due to a diphtheria epidemic.<ref>Bidwell, Carol A. (1989).

[[Newbury Park, California|Newbury Park]] was a more established community than Thousand Oaks at the turn of the 20th century. A few lots existed early in the 1900s, wedged between Borchard land on the south and Friedrich land on the north.<ref>Schroeder, Anne (2000). ''Branches on the Conejo: Leaving the Soil After Five Generations''. Russell Dean & Company. Page 86. {{ISBN|9781891954993}}.</ref> The [[Janss Investment Company|Janss family]], developers of Southern California subdivisions, purchased {{convert|10000|acre|km2}} in the early 20th century.

The results of the cityhood election was clear on September 24, 1964. 2,780 residents voted to set up a city, while 1,821 had voted no to incorporation. Certain areas however tried to set up its own municipality. An attempt at a cityhood election in [[Newbury Park, California|Newbury Park]] failed in 1963, as Talley Corporation and Janss Rancho Conejo Industrial Park refused to join the efforts. [[Reba Hays Jeffries]], a local opponent of cityhood, told interviewers why she thought the cityhood election failed: Cityhood backers had to collect signatures from owners who represented 29% of the land that was to be incorporated. As the efforts collected 29% of registered voters, rather than owners of 29% of the land, the measure never came on the ballot.<ref>Bidwell, Carol A. (1989).

The annual Scandinavian Festival ("Scan Fest") is an annual weekend spring festival which takes place at [[California Lutheran University]] every April. The festival was the first held as an accomplishment of John J. Nordberg, who was instrumental in getting the first [[American-Scandinavian Foundation]] chapter chartered in Thousand Oaks. The festival was established in order to boost cultural ties between California Lutheran College and the [[Nordic countries]]. The festival offers foods, folk dances, music, literature and art from the Nordic Countries, including from [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Iceland]], [[Finland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]. The first festival was held in 1974 and was attended by over a thousand visitors.<ref>Hekhuis, Mary (1984). ''California Lutheran College: The First Quarter-Century''.

On September 22, 2018, the City of Thousand Oaks hosted its first, [[intersectional]] LGBTQ+ event outside of the Mary and Richard Carpenter Civic Arts Plaza Park. The Festival hosted over 2,000 attendees and its highlights included LGBTQ+ talent in the form of spoken word, dance, music, and art. The Festival also featured mental and physical health services, LGBTQ+ non-profits, supportive religious organizations, local business vendors, a tribute to the 1969 [[Stonewall Riots]], youth arts/crafts, and more. The initial goal of this event was to bring critical visibility to the entire LGBTQ+ community of the Conejo Valley and to provide a cathartic experience for all attendees. The festival's organizers hope to make this an annual tradition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.conejovalleypride.com/|title=Conejo Valley Pride – LGBTQ+ festival in Thousand Oaks Sept 28 2019|website=Conejo Valley Pride}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theacorn.com/articles/conejo-valley-fest-will-share-its-pride/ |title=Conejo Valley fest will share its pride |work=The Acorn |date=September 13, 2018 |access-date=April 12, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Alicia Doyle |url=https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/local/2018/08/09/2-events-celebrate-ventura-countys-lgbtq-community/885731002/ |title=2 events celebrate Ventura County's LGBTQ community |work=Vcstar.com |date=August 9, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.toacorn.com/articles/filled-with-pride/ |title=Filled with pride |work=Toacorn.com |date=September 27, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=CONEJO VALLEY PRIDE: Creating Community Through Visibility |url=http://www.ragemonthly.com/2018/09/12/conejo-valley-pride-creating-community-through-visibility/|work=Rage Monthly |date=September 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116131526/http://www.ragemonthly.com/2018/09/12/conejo-valley-pride-creating-community-through-visibility/ |archive-date=November 16, 2018}}</ref>

[[Conejo Valley Airport]], also known as Janss Airport,<ref>O'Brien, Tricia (2017). ''Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village''. Arcadia Publishing. Page 38. {{ISBN|9781467125697}}.</ref> was an airport in Thousand Oaks. It had the first qualified flying field in the [[Conejo Valley]], and was opened sometime between 1946 and 1949 by the [[Janss Corporation]], which had large land holdings in the area. The airport had 2,800 feet of unpaved runway, located parallel to Ventura Road, now known as [[Thousand Oaks Boulevard]] (near Moorpark Road). When the state established a highway through town in 1952, the airfield was moved to the south side of the 101 [[Ventura Freeway]]. The airport was often featured in movies, including ''[[Francis (film)|Francis the Talking Mule]]'' (1950) with [[Donald O'Conner]].<ref>Sprankling, Miriam and Ruthanne Begun (2012).

The airport was no longer in use by 1962, and is the present location of [[Los Robles Greens Golf Course]]. The Janss Corporation later announced they would construct a new airport on the 1,400 acre Friedrich Ranch in [[Newbury Park, California|Newbury Park]], which they had purchased to develop the [[Rancho Conejo Industrial Park]]. Rancho Conejo Airport opened on May 5, 1960, and considered an executive airport. It had a 4,300-foot surfaced and lighted runway, and was described by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'': "It was the finest executive aircraft facility on the West Coast... and will serve the needs of the fast-moving executives of the space-age industries." The airport was used in the filming of ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World]]'' in 1963. The airport closed by 1965–66, and the land remained empty until 1991 when [[Shapell Industries]] constructed Rancho Conejo Village homes. The former site is northwest of the intersection of Lawrence Drive and Ventu Park Road in Newbury Park.<ref>Sprankling, Miriam and Ruthanne Begun (2012). ''Tales and Voices of the Conejo''.

Prior to the 1930s, fires were fought by local ranchers. Conejo Valley residents all signed a petition appealing for a truck. The request was presented to Ventura County Fire Warden, [[Walter Emerick]], in April 1931. Louis Goebel, the owner of [[Goebel's Lion Farm]], contacted the warden and wrote: "If you provide Thousand Oaks with a fire truck, I'll build a fire station for it and you can use it as long as you want." The offer was accepted and Goebel built a 22-by-50&nbsp;ft. extension onto his main building. On the evening of March 28, 1932, Walter Emerick delivered the valley's first fire engine.<ref>Sprankling, Miriam and Ruthanne Begun (2012). ''Tales and Voices of the Conejo''.

Tom Moody became the first Conejo Valley Fire Chief and established a temporary fire station in [[Lake Sherwood, California|Lake Sherwood]] in 1942. Two permanent fire stations were built in 1949: one in Lake Sherwood and a new station at 67 Erbes Road which replaced the fire station at Goebel's Lion Farm. In 1961 Fire Station 34 was constructed followed by Station 35 in [[Newbury Park, California|Newbury Park]] in 1962. Two stations were established to replace Station 31 on Erbes Road: Station 30 on Hillcrest Dr. (1974) and a new Fire Station 31 on Duesenburg Drive (1977). Fire Station 36 was built in 1985, followed by Station 37 in North Ranch in 2001.<ref>Sprankling, Miriam and Ruthanne Begun (2012). ''Tales and Voices of the Conejo''.

Thousand Oaks Police Department was established on July 1, 1965, nine months after the city was incorporated, and has contracted the sheriff's department to provide police service since inception.<ref name="toacorn4">{{cite web|url=https://www.toacorn.com/articles/the-first-topd/|title=The First TOPD {{pipe}} Thousand Oaks Acorn|website=toacorn.com|date=May 2014|access-date=November 28, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428000407/https://www.toacorn.com/articles/the-first-topd/|archive-date=April 28, 2018}}</ref>

The city's police department was instituted on July 1, 1965, with a personnel complement of twelve persons and two patrol vehicles. Captain T. Burt Stevens was the city's first Chief of Police.<ref>[http://search.tolibrary.org/search~S1?/Xthousand+oaks+20&searchscope=1&SORT=DZ/Xthousand+oaks+20&searchscope=1&SORT=DZ&extended=0&SUBKEY=thousand+oaks+20/1%2C6%2C6%2CB/frameset&FF=Xthousand+oaks+20&searchscope=1&SORT=DZ&1%2C1%2C City of Thousand Oaks (1984). ''20 Years: Thousand Oaks''. Ventura Printing. Page 16.]</ref> The police station was originally operated under contract with the [[Ventura County Sheriff's Department]]. Fifteen officers, a sergeant, and a station commander serving as police chief, began work officially on July 1, 1965. Prior to the new police station, the closest deputies were in the city of [[Ventura, California|Ventura]] and had to make the far trek to the [[Conejo Valley]] when crimes occurred. A resident deputy had also been assigned to the valley prior to the new station, who received his calls out of the family home. When the police station was established, it was originally two patrol cars to cover the city.<ref>Sprankling, Miriam and Ruthanne Begun (2012). ''Tales and Voices of the Conejo''. Newbury Park, CA: Conejo Valley Historical Society. Page 109. {{ISBN|0-9725233-6-7}}.</ref> As of 1973, the police department was staffed by nineteen deputies from the Ventura County Sheriff's East Valley Station. There were four one-man patrol vehicles which were operated on 24-hour basis.<ref name="Commerce 1973 Page 9"/>

At first, the police station was housed in a room at the Park Oaks Fire Station, on the corner of Avenida de Los Arboles and Moorpark Road. As the officers soon outgrew the small room, the house across the street was rented and turned into a police station. The little house on Avenida de Los Arboles gave way to a professional sheriff's station, which was established on Olsen Road in 1969. It was replaced in 1988 with a more modern station, located just a half-mile down Olsen Road.<ref>Sprankling, Miriam and Ruthanne Begun (2012). ''Tales and Voices of the Conejo''.

==== Highway honors officer ====
The portion of the Ventura Freeway that passes through the city has been named in honor of Ventura County Sheriff Sergeant Ron Helus, who was killed after entering the Borderline Bar & Grill to confront the perpetrator of a [[Thousand Oaks shooting|mass shooting event]] in November 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://keyt.com/news/ventura-county/2019/11/06/sheriffs-office-dedicate-highway-sign-in-honor-of-sergeant-ron-helus-in-ventura-county/|title=Ventura County Sheriff's Office dedicates highway sign in honor of Sgt.
