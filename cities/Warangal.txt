Warangal served as the capital of the [[Kakatiya dynasty]] which was established in 1163. The monuments left by the Kakatiyas include fortresses, lakes, temples and stone gateways which, in the present, helped the city to become a popular tourist attraction. The [[Kakatiya Kala Thoranam]] was included in the [[emblem of Telangana]] by the state government and Warangal is also touted as the cultural capital of Telangana.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mahender|first=Adepu|date=25 August 2018|title=Cultural capital of Telangana awaits State auditorium|url=https://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Warangal-Tab/2018-08-25/Cultural-capital-of-Telangana-awaits-State-auditorium/407555|access-date=12 October 2021|website=www.thehansindia.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/Warangal-city-may-not-be-divided/article14625930.ece|title=Warangal city may not be divided|last=Rao|first=Gollapudi Srinivasa|date=7 September 2016|work=The Hindu|access-date=16 December 2017|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref>

The three urban cities: [[Kazipet]], [[Hanamkonda]] and Warangal are together known as [[Warangal Tri-City]]. The three cities are connected by the National Highway 163 ([[Hyderabad]]–[[Bhuvanagiri, Telangana|Bhuvanagiri]]–Warangal–[[Bhopalpatnam]]). The major stations are Kazipet Junction railway station and Warangal railway station.

== Etymology ==
During the 160 years of [[Kakatiya dynasty|Kakatiya]] rule between 1163 and 1323 CE, Warangal was referred with various names like ''Orugallu'', ''Ekashila Nagaram'', or ''Omatikonda''; all these mean a 'single stone', referring to a huge granite boulder present in the Warangal fort.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hridayindia.in/warangal/ |title = HRI Day India| date=21 August 2023 }}</ref> When the Kakatiya dynasty was defeated by [[Delhi Sultanate]] in 1323 CE, ruler [[Juna Khan]], Crown Prince of [[Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq]], conquered the city and renamed it as Sultanpur.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jayapalan |first1=N. |title=History of India |date=2001 |publisher=Atlantic Publishers & Distri |isbn=978-81-7156-928-1 |page=34 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6L6avTlqJNYC&pg=PA34 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7ZZzk8cXh8C&q=warangal+named+as+sultanpur&pg=PA86 | title=Series-16 Indian History–Medieval India}}</ref> Later [[Musunuri Nayaks]] recaptured Warangal in 1336 CE and named it Orugallu again.

Warangal was the ancient capital of the Kakatiya dynasty.<ref>{{cite book |title=Historic Landmarks of the Deccan |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.106468 |last=Haig |first=Thomas Wolseley |author-link=Wolseley Haig |year=1907 |place=Allahabad |publisher=The Pioneer Press |page=66}}</ref> It was ruled by many kings such as Beta Raja I, Prola Raja I, Beta Raja II, Prola Raja II, [[Rudradeva]], Mahadeva, Ganapathideva, [[Prataparudra]] and [[Rani Rudrama Devi]] who is the only woman to rule over Telugu region. Beta Raja I is the founder of Kakatiya Dynasty and ruled the kingdom for 30 years and was succeeded by his son Prola Raja I who shifted his capital to [[Hanamkonda]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of Kakatiya Dynasty (Kakatiya Empire, Kakatiyas)| url=https://www.importantindia.com/9551/kakatiya-dynasty/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920063344/http://www.importantindia.com:80/9551/kakatiya-dynasty/| archive-date=20 September 2017|url-status=dead |date=13 December 2013}}</ref>

The cultural and administrative distinction of the Kakatiyas was mentioned by [[Marco Polo]]. After the defeat of [[Prataparudra II]], the [[Musunuri Nayaks]] united 72 Nayak chieftains and captured Warangal from [[Delhi Sultanate]] and ruled for fifty years. After the demise of the Nayaks, Warangal was part of the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] and then the Sultanate of [[Golconda]].

The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Aurangzeb]] conquered [[Golconda]] in 1687, and it remained part of the Mughal empire until the southern provinces of the empire split away to become the state of [[Hyderabad state|Hyderabad]] in 1724, which included the Telangana region and some parts of [[Maharashtra]] and [[Karnataka]]. Hyderabad was annexed to India in 1948, and became an [[States and territories of India|Indian state]] called Hyderabad state. In 1956, Hyderabad state was partitioned as part of the [[States Reorganisation Act]], and Telangana, the [[Telugu language|Telugu]]-speaking region of Hyderabad state, which includes Warangal, became part of Andhra Pradesh. After the Telangana movement, Telangana state was formed on 2 June 2014, Warangal became a part of Telangana State.
