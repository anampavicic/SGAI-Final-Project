==History==
===Early history===
The history of Bulandshahr begins even before 1200 B.C. This region is nearer to the capital of Pandavas – Indraprasth and Hastinapur. After the decline of Hastinapur, Ahar which is situated in the north east of district Bulandshahr became an important place for Pnadavas. With the passage of time, the king Parmal's descendant Maharaja Ahibaran<ref>{{Cite book |last=Atkinson |first=Edwin T. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CBTc7SPqr2kC&dq=ahibaran+family&pg=PA84 |title=Statistical descriptive and historical account of the North-Western provinces of India: Ed. ... by Edwin [Felix] Thomas Atkinson |date=1876 |publisher=North-Western Provinces' Government Press |language=en}}</ref> made a fort on this part of region and laid the foundation of a tower called Baran(Bulandshahr).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Singh |first=Kuar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttqwEAAAQBAJ&dq=ahibaran+family&pg=PA6 |title=Historical and Statistical Memoir of Zila Bulandshahar |date=2023-02-28 |publisher=BoD – Books on Demand |isbn=978-3-382-50031-3 |language=en}}</ref> Since it was perched on a highland it came to be known as high city which was translated into Persian language as Bulandshahr.

The kingdom of Baran came to an end probably during the 12th century. It was being ruled by Dod Rajputs who were tributaries of the royal family of Baran, Baranwals and ruled under the royal family's name, the family was considered a direct descendant of Pandavas. In 1192 CE when [[Muhammad of Ghor|Muhammad Ghauri]] conquered parts of India, his general [[Qutb-ud-din Aibak|Qutubuddin Aibak]] conquered Fort Baran; Raja Chandrasen Baran died fighting but not before killing Khwaja , the commander of the Aibak army, in whose memory a maqbara was built.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}
