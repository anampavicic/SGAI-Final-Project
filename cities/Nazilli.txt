== Etymology ==
Nazilli is a [[Turkish language|Turkish]] name that has somehow evolved from the former (also Turkish) name of Pazarköy (marketplace). According to [[legend]], the son of [[Aydın Province|Aydın]]'s governor in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period, fell in love with a young woman from Pazarköy but was rejected by the girl's father. The young man later named the town [[Nazlı]] Ili (Nazlı's Home) after his loved one. The 17th century traveller [[Evliya Çelebi]] held that the town was named for the capriciousness ("naz") of the local women in this wealthy town. Or it could have been the name of a family of [[Turkoman (ethnonym)|Turkomans]] that settled here.

Nazilli was still called '''Nazli''' by the [[British people|British]] as of 1920.<ref name=Prothero101>{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Anatolia|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|page=101|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11766/view/1/101/}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Define Vadisi.106.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Coins from the ancient city of [[Harpasa]] ([[Ancient Greek]]: Ἅρπασα), within the borders of the Esenköy village of Aydın-Nazilli district.]]
These people practiced weaving and thus planted cotton in the area for this purpose. The [[Oghuz Turks]] were succeeded by the [[Anatolian beyliks]] of [[Beylik of Menteşe|Menteşe]] (in 1280) and then [[Aydinids]].

In 1390 [[Bayezid I]] brought the area into the [[Ottoman Empire]]. At this time, the town comprised two villages, Cuma Yeri (Friday Square) and Pazarköy (Weekday Market). The town was only later referred to as Nazliköy. In 1402 [[Timur]] defeated Bayezid at the [[Battle of Ankara]] and took control of the Aegean region, expelling the [[Knights Hospitaller]] and giving the Nazilli area back to the Aydinid family. It was quickly recovered for the Ottomans by Sultan [[Murad II]].

From 1867 until 1922, Nazilli was part of the [[Aidin Vilayet]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. During the [[Turkish War of Independence]], Nazilli was occupied by the [[Greek Army]] and came under Turkish control on September 5, 1922.

== Geography ==
Nazilli stands on the [[Menderes River]] and much of the district is in the Menderes valley, full of [[citrus]] trees, [[olive]]s and [[ficus|fig]]s as well as cotton, wheat and other crops.
