In 1811, [[David Stuart (fur trader)|David Stuart]] travelled to the Okanagan Valley, becoming the first European to do so.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|last=Surtees|first=Ursula|title=A Pictorial History of Kelowna BC|url=https://www.kelownabc.com/kelowna/|access-date=April 16, 2021|website=Kelowna BC|publisher=Kelowna Centennial Museum|archive-date=April 16, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210416155613/https://www.kelownabc.com/kelowna/|url-status=live}}</ref> Despite this, it was not until 1859 that [[Father Pandosy]], a French [[Roman Catholic]] [[Oblate]] missionary, became the first European to settle there.

Although the population remained small for the rest of the 19th century, sustenance fruit growing expanded in Kelowna during the 1870s, and by the 1890s, commercial agriculture had become firmly established.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ormsby|first=Margaret A.|date=1935|title=Fruit Marketing in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3739660|journal=Agricultural History|volume=9|issue=2|pages=80–97|jstor=3739660|issn=0002-1482|access-date=April 16, 2021|archive-date=April 16, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210416155613/https://www.jstor.org/stable/3739660|url-status=live}}</ref>

Although agriculture had become an important mark of Kelowna in the surrounding region, the town relied entirely on transportation over Okanagan Lake until 1925. In 1893, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CP) constructed the steamer [[SS Aberdeen|SS ''Aberdeen'']] on the lake, which served as the first significant transportation link between Kelowna and [[Penticton]], greatly increasing the speed of Kelowna's growth.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Story of Lake Boats in the Okanagan|url=http://sssicamous.ca/the-story-of-lake-boats-in-the-okanagan/|website=SS Sicamous|access-date=April 16, 2021|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802040508/http://sssicamous.ca/the-story-of-lake-boats-in-the-okanagan/ |archive-date=August 2, 2014}}</ref> On September 11, 1925, CP was extended to Kelowna, ending the town's reliance on Okanagan Lake for transportation and trade.<ref name=":0" />

The coldest recorded temperature in the city was {{cvt|-36.1|C}} recorded on December 30, 1968. The last time the lake completely froze over was in the winter of 1969.A partial lake freeze also took place in the winter of 1985-1986. Some winters pass without any significant surface ice.  

An inversion layer of cloud created by Pacific low pressure system moving into or stalling over the southern interior give Kelowna and the Okanagan Valley near constant cloudy conditions during December and January, making it the cloudiest winter climate in Canada, outside of parts of Newfoundland. Since Okanagan Lake rarely freezes, the warmer air from the lake rises above the colder atmospheric air, leading to a temperature inversion that also contributes to the valley being enveloped by clouds. <ref>Strachan, Brady, [http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/it-could-be-a-lot-colder-kelowna-historian-remembers-okanagan-lake-freezing-over-completely-1.3904359 "It could be a lot colder: Kelowna historian remembers Okanagan Lake freezing over completely"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503002918/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/it-could-be-a-lot-colder-kelowna-historian-remembers-okanagan-lake-freezing-over-completely-1.3904359 |date=May 3, 2018 }}, ''CBC British Columbia'', Retrieved on April 19, 2018.</ref> This valley cloud has a low ceiling, and often bright sunshine can be experienced by driving approximately 20 minutes up into the nearby mountains.

=== Central City ===
Central City is a linear commercial sector along [[British Columbia Highway 97|Harvey Avenue]], from downtown to [[British Columbia Highway 33|Highway 33]]. Major commercial developments include the Capri Centre Mall, the Landmark buildings, and the Orchard Park Shopping Centre. Commercial activity is mainly concentrated along or near [[Highway 97]] (Harvey).

=== Dilworth Mountain===
Dilworth Mountain is a relatively low, isolated mountain just over 2000 feet near the city's geographic centre. Adjoining Knox Mountain to the west, it is part of the eastern heights that form Glenmore Valley and rises about one thousand feet above the rest of the Okanagan Valley. It has been extensively developed in recent years, with scenic suburban-influenced neighbourhoods only minutes from Central City. Like many other Kelowna residential districts, Dilworth has gone from relative isolation and wilderness to a community hosting hundreds of homes, many of which are considered relatively high-end.

=== Downtown ===
[[File:Kelowna Skyline in Feb, 2021.jpg|thumb|Downtown Kelowna from Dilworth Mountain in 2021]]
Central Kelowna is a tourist district alongside Okanagan Lake. It is officially defined as all land north of Highway 97, south of Clement Avenue, east of [[Okanagan Lake]], and west of Richter Street. There are two main routes through the downtown core, along which attractions and commerce are concentrated. These include several parks and beaches, boardwalks and other walking trails, Kelowna Marina and Yacht Club, the Delta Grand Hotel and Casino, and [[Prospera Place]] arena. The other main route through downtown is Bernard Avenue from Richter Street to the lake, with more shops and restaurants designed for locals and tourists. Although Bernard Avenue continues east well past downtown, it is not part of downtown and is zoned residential. The commercial segment lies within its downtown section between Richter and Abbott streets, the latter of which is lake-adjacent.<ref name="abbott_street">{{Google maps |title=Map of Abbott Street, Kelowna, BC, Canada |url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Abbott+St,+Kelowna,+BC/@49.8742652,-119.4994865,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x537d8b4d3a3b2785:0x37b609e35a5fde64!8m2!3d49.8742652!4d-119.4972978 |access-date=October 4, 2018}}</ref>

=== Glenmore ===
[[Glenmore, British Columbia|Glenmore]] is a suburb primarily within Glenmore Valley, a subsection of the Okanagan Valley in the Kelowna area. It has been extensively developed in the past two decades, transforming from a small suburb with a rural character to large suburban neighbourhoods, including several elementary schools and a rapidly growing commercial hub. While most of its homes are on the relatively flat valley bottom, several large and more recent neighbourhoods, including the community of Wilden, are being built into the adjacent mountains.

=== Midtown ===
The Midtown area, bordered by Enterprise Way on the north and Springfield and Baron Road on the south, is a popular shopping destination for locals. [[Orchard Park Shopping Centre|Orchard Park]], the shopping complex in BC's interior, is here. Since most of Midtown consists of large, car-oriented [[big-box store]]s, it is often criticized for its plainness; its contributions to urban sprawl and the decline of the pedestrian-oriented Downtown; and its lack of green space, as the area was formerly a linear park and golf course.

=== Mission ===
Known locally as "the Mission" (or "[[Okanagan Mission, British Columbia|Okanagan Mission]]") to differentiate it from the Lower Mainland city of [[Mission, British Columbia|Mission]], this area was a separate jurisdiction before being amalgamated with Kelowna in the mid-to-late-20th century. It features a vibrant secondary commercial centre separate from the downtown, with low- to moderate-density residential areas between them. Its northern border is K.L.O. Road. It is often differentiated as Lower Mission and Upper Mission.

The Lower Mission contains most of the aforementioned commercial areas, such as shopping malls, grocery stores, coffee shops, and boutiques, and also has extensive recreational facilities. Mission Recreation Park has six softball diamonds, soccer fields, community gardens, playgrounds, and trails while neighbouring H2O is Kelowna's largest indoor recreation facility with a 50&nbsp;m pool, water slides, diving boards, and surfing waves. Gyro Beach and Rotary Beach, two of Kelowna's most popular beaches, are also located in the Lower Mission.

The Upper Mission begins to extend into the foothills and higher terrain, and many parts of this area boast magnificent views of the city, mountains and [[Okanagan Lake]]. As a result, this part of town is widely regarded as luxurious and is indeed one of the most expensive neighbourhoods of Kelowna. It is not unusual to see homes worth one million dollars or more, the most costly of which can reach 5 million or even slightly above.

=== Rutland ===
[[Rutland, British Columbia|Rutland]] is Kelowna's largest neighbourhood by far. Although most of the area sits on the valley bottom and is therefore relatively flat, the fringes continue up into the hills and are thus built at higher elevations and possess more expansive views than the rest of the neighbourhood; these homes are correspondingly more expensive. This is the exception, however, as the majority of Rutland is among the most affordable of Kelowna housing. Additionally, the presence of numerous low-rise apartment buildings contributes to a higher population density compared to other areas of the town. Rutland was a town until it amalgamated with Kelowna in 1973,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.learnforestry.com/lessons/grade3/2007/timeline_kelowna.pdf|title=The History of Kelowna|website=Learnforestry.com|access-date=December 27, 2018|archive-date=July 13, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713193401/http://www.learnforestry.com/lessons/grade3/2007/timeline_kelowna.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> and this union has resulted in Rutland having a distinct commercial centre with many shops and restaurants. An improvement and [[gentrification]] effort has been ongoing for the past decade, with new parks, widened sidewalks, bike lanes, a renovated YMCA, a rebuilt high school, and many new shops and condominiums being added.

Kelowna is the seat of the [[Regional District of Central Okanagan, British Columbia|Regional District of the Central Okanagan]], the third-largest metropolitan area in British Columbia after Vancouver and Victoria and the largest in the British Columbia Interior. With scenic lake vistas and a dry, mild climate, Kelowna has become one of the fastest-growing cities in North America. The appropriate management of such rapid development (and its attendant consequences) is a source of significant debate within the community. Kelowna is the fourth least affordable housing market in Canada, currently maintaining the classification of "Severely Unaffordable."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.demographia.com/dhi.pdf |title=6th Annual Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey: 2010 |access-date=May 5, 2011 |archive-date=January 23, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123080849/http://www.demographia.com/dhi.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> Because of the [[Okanagan]]'s climate and vineyard-filled scenery, it is often compared to [[Napa Valley, California]].<ref>[http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/10/06/travel/escapes/06okan.html The Okanagan, a Napa of the North] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103140640/http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/10/06/travel/escapes/06okan.html |date=January 3, 2010 }}, New York Times, October 6, 2006</ref>
