'''Kanpur Cantonment''' (popularly referred to as '''Kanpur Cantt''') is a [[cantonment|military cantonment]] in [[Kanpur]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]]. The Kanpur Cantonment was established in the year 1811 and is situated on the right bank of river Ganges and is bound by Kanpur city area on the remaining three sides. Kanpur Cantonment is the largest cantonment in India, by population and not by the area. The area of the Cantonment is approx. 4243.0084 acres (17&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) out of which the Bungalow Area is 3899.1784 acres and the Civil Area is 334.83 acres. As per 2011 Census, the population of Cantonment is 108,035 which is 453rd largest city of India (See t
he point 2 on external links).

==History==

The historical reasons necessitating the formation of individual cantonments are different for different cantonments depending upon the prevailing political and military realities of the times.

For example, Secundrabad cantonment was established to assist the Nizam of Hyderabad, militarily against his local adversaries, whereas Lucknow Cantonment was established to maintain pressure on the Nawab of Oudh and to finally capture that state. Similarly, the need for cooler climate for the British troops and strategic importance of Doab dictated the setting up of hill cantonments and cantonments in modern-day Uttar Pradesh respectively.

However, irrespective of the local factors, the paramount consideration in setting up all these cantonments was the need for military camps in various strategic locations of India to establish, maintain and consolidate the rule of a foreign power.

Spread of diseases such as diarrhea, malaria, and venereal diseases among the troops necessitated the cantoning (insulation) of these military camps from the local population.

The records of 19th-century British India reveal that health and hygiene of the troops was one of the major areas of concern which the rulers of the day had to contend with. This consideration coupled with the desire of an alien ruling elite to distance itself from the native population led to the development of an insulated type of character in all these cantonments which continues today.

The Kanpur Cantonment played an important role in the 1857  uprising under the leadership of [[Nana Sahib]]  and  [[Tatya Tope]] (see [[Siege of Cawnpore]]).  The uprising led to a massacre of the British at the [[Satichaura Ghat]] (also called Massacre Ghat). It is of historical significance symbolising the casualties during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. Many religious/social functions are organized every year in the months of August and September to commemorate the events, which are attended by a large number of people.

==Water supply==

The piped water supply consisting of underground reservoir and pumping station in the cantonment was provided by the Kanpur Development Board in 1962, and no further extension or augmentation was taken since then to meet the demands of the rising population. This resulted in absolute water crisis in many areas of the cantonment. The Cantonment Board entrusted the work of preparation of an augmentation/reorganisation project to U.P. Jal Nigam in 1986, which was launched in July, 1989.  The project was completed in March 2000 at a cost of Rs. 3.53 crores.

The Cantonment Board is providing water supply through its underground reservoir at Zonal Pumping Station located at Mirpur, and two overhead tanks located at M.G. Park and near Navsheel  Aptts., through a network of 35&nbsp;km of pipelines. The Board buys water in bulk from Kanpur Jal Sansthan apart from the water drawn from the six tubewells maintained by the Board. Out of which 4 tubewells and 2 overheads are maintained by the contractor. About 650 India Mark-II Hand pumps have also been provided at various places to support the piped water supply system and to cater for the requirement of poor residents. All the hand pumps are maintained properly.  To meet the water requirement of the residents for particular purposes and occasions like marriages, religious functions, social gatherings, cultural activities, the Board maintains 2 water tankers of 4000 litres capacity each, which are made available against payment of Rs.300/- each.

'''Public health'''

Dustbins are provided at suitable central locations from where it is removed and disposed of at the trenching ground near Badey Purwa Village. Cleaning of ward no 1, 2 and 4 are done through contractors.
