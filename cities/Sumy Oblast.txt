The oblast was created in its most recent form, from the merging of [[Raion|raions]] from [[Kharkiv Oblast]], [[Chernihiv Oblast]], and [[Poltava Oblast]] in 1939 by the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] of the [[Soviet Union]].

The estimated population is {{Ua-pop-est2022|1,035,772|.}}

The administrative center of the oblast is the city of [[Sumy]]. Other important cities within the oblast include [[Konotop]], [[Okhtyrka]], [[Romny]], and [[Shostka]]. The modern region combines territories of the historical [[Severia]] (northern part) and [[Sloboda Ukraine]] (southern part). On territory of the Sumy Oblast important centers of Ukrainian culture are located, such as the city of [[Hlukhiv]] which served as a hetman residence during the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] as well as the cities of [[Okhtyrka]] and [[Sumy]] which were regional centers of the [[Sloboda Ukraine]].

The oblast has a heavy mix of agriculture and industry, with over 600 industrial locations. Among the most notable was the Soviet [[film stock]] manufacturer [[Svema]] in [[Shostka]]. Importantly, seven rivers pass through the oblast.

==History==
The region was created on the ukase of [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] of the [[Soviet Union]] on 10 January 1939 as part of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. The newly created Sumy Oblast included 12 former [[Raions of Ukraine|raions]] of [[Kharkiv Oblast]], 17 former raions of [[Chernihiv Oblast]], and 2 former raions of [[Poltava Oblast]].

During [[World War II]] in 1941–43, it was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] under administration of the German [[Wehrmacht]]. After the German forces were driven out, the Soviet Union regained control of the region under jurisdiction of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]].

In 1965 one of former Chernihiv Oblast raions ([[Talalaivka Raion]]) was returned to Chernihiv Oblast.

During the 2022 [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]] the Sumy Oblast was one of the first regions where [[Northern Ukraine offensive|Russian and Ukrainian forces clashed]].<ref>{{cite web|date=24 February 2022|title=Украинские пограничники сообщили об атаке границы со стороны России и Белоруссии|url=https://www.interfax.ru/world/824058|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220224073734/https://www.interfax.ru/world/824058|archive-date=24 February 2022|access-date=24 February 2022|website=Interfax}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=|date=|title=Войска России на севере Украины продвинулись вглубь до пяти километров – Арестович|url=https://www.unian.net/war/voyska-rossii-na-severe-ukrainy-prodvinulis-vglub-do-pyati-kilometrov-arestovich-novosti-donbassa-11715571.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220224091205/https://www.unian.net/war/voyska-rossii-na-severe-ukrainy-prodvinulis-vglub-do-pyati-kilometrov-arestovich-novosti-donbassa-11715571.html|archive-date=24 February 2022|access-date=24 February 2022|website=|language=}}</ref><ref name="hromadske.online">{{cite web|author=|date=24 February 2022|title=Перші три дні повномасштабної російсько-української війни (текстовий онлайн) &#124; Громадське телебачення|url=https://hromadske.ua/posts/rosijsko-ukrayinska-vijna-tekstovij-onlajn|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220224060243/https://hromadske.ua/posts/rosijsko-ukrayinska-vijna-tekstovij-onlajn|archive-date=24 February 2022|access-date=24 February 2022|website=[[Hromadske]]|language=uk}}</ref> Parts of the oblast [[Russian occupation of Sumy Oblast|came under Russian occupation]] during the invasion.

==Nomenclature==

Most of Ukraine's oblasts are named after their capital cities, officially referred to as "oblast centers" ({{langx|uk|обласний центр}}, [[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]] ''oblasnyi tsentr''). The name of each oblast is a [[relative clause|relative]] [[adjective]], formed by adding a feminine [[suffix]] to the name of respective center city: ''Sumy'' is the center of the ''Sums’ka oblast'' (Sumy Oblast). Most oblasts are also sometimes referred to in a feminine noun form, following the convention of traditional regional place names, ending with the suffix "-shchyna", as is the case with the Sumy Oblast, ''Sumshchyna''.
