Along with a few other canal-based northern cities, such as [[Amsterdam]] and [[Saint Petersburg]], it is sometimes referred to as the [[Venice of the North]]. Bruges has significant economic importance, thanks to its [[#Port|port]], and was once one of the world's chief commercial cities.<ref name="world and its people">{{cite book |last=Dunton |first=Larkin |title=The World and Its People |url=https://archive.org/details/worldanditspeop05duntgoog/page/n166 |publisher=Silver, Burdett |year=1896 |page=158 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Charlier |first1=Roger H. |author-link=Roger Charlier |title=Grandeur, Decadence, and Renaissance |journal=Journal of Coastal Research |date=2005 |pages=425–447 |jstor=25737011 |quote=Rise, fall, and resurrection make up the life story of Bruges, a city that glittered in Northern Europe with as much panache as Venice did in the Mediterranean World. }}</ref> Bruges is a major tourism destination within Belgium and is well-known as the seat of the [[College of Europe]], a university institute for European studies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-24662050 |title=College of Europe in Bruges: Home of Thatcher speech |first=Adam |last=Fleming |work=BBC |date=25 October 2013 |access-date=10 July 2015 }}</ref>

==Etymology==
The earliest mention of the location's name is as {{Lang|la|Bruggas}}, {{Lang|la|Brvggas}} or {{Lang|la|Brvccia}} in [[Anno Domini|AD]] 840–875. Afterwards, it appears as {{Lang|la|Bruciam}} and {{Lang|la|Bruociam}} (892); as {{Lang|la|Brutgis uico}} (late ninth century); as {{Lang|la|in portu Bruggensi}} ({{circa|1010}}); as {{Lang|la|Bruggis}} (1012); as {{Lang|ang|Bricge}} in the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] (1037); as {{Lang|la|Brugensis}} (1046); as {{Lang|ang|Brycge}} in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (1049–1052); as {{Lang|und|Brugias}} (1072); as {{Lang|und|Bruges}} (1080–1085); as {{Lang|und|Bruggas}} ({{circa|1084}}); as {{Lang|und|Brugis}} (1089); and as {{Lang|und|Brugge}} (1116).<ref>[[Maurits Gysseling]], ''Toponymisch woordenboek van België, Nederland, Luxemburg, Noord-Frankrijk en West-Duitsland (vóór 1226)'', Brussel 1960, p. 195.</ref>

The name probably derives from the [[Old Dutch]] for 'bridge': {{wikt-lang|odt|brugga}}. Also compare [[Middle Dutch]] {{lang|dum|brucge}}, {{lang|dum|brugge}} (or {{lang|dum|brugghe}}, {{lang|dum|brigghe}}, {{lang|dum|bregghe}}, {{lang|dum|brogghe}}), and modern Dutch {{lang|nl|bruggenhoofd}} ('bridgehead') and {{lang|nl|brug}} ('bridge').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/brug |title=brug |work=etymologiebank.nl |date=5 April 1922 |access-date=20 February 2014}}</ref> The form {{lang|nl|brugghe}} would be a southern Dutch variant.<ref>M.

==History==
{{For timeline}}

===Origins===
Bruges was a location of coastal settlement during prehistory. This Bronze Age and Iron Age settlement are unrelated to medieval city development. In the Bruges area, the first fortifications were built after [[Julius Caesar]]'s conquest of the [[Menapii]] in the first century BC, to protect the coastal area against pirates. The [[Franks]] took over the whole region from the [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Romans]] around the fourth century and administered it as the ''[[Pagus]] Flandrensis''. The [[Viking]] incursions of the ninth century prompted Count [[Baldwin I, Count of Flanders|Baldwin I]] of [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] to reinforce the Roman fortifications; trade soon resumed with England and [[Scandinavia]]. Early medieval habitation starts in the ninth and tenth centuries on the Burgh terrain, probably with a fortified settlement and church.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yV-wAAAAIAAJ&q=medieval+bruges+burgh|title=An Ethnogeography of Late Medieval Bruges|date=1 January 2004|isbn=9780773464216|last1=Boogaart|first1=Thomas A.|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press }}</ref>

===Golden age (12th to 15th centuries)===
[[File:Belgium-36 (26598965719).jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[Markt (Bruges)|Markt]]'' (market square)]]

In 1089, Bruges became the capital of the [[County of Flanders]]. Bruges received its [[city charter]] on 27 July 1128, and new walls and canals were built. By the 12th century, the city had gained an autonomous administration.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Fossier |first=Robert |url=http://archive.org/details/cambridgeillustr00robe |title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Middle Ages |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1986 |isbn=978-0-521-26644-4 |location=Cambridge; New York |pages=374 |language=en}}</ref> Het Zwin (Golden Inlet), the tidal inlet of Bruges, was crucial to the development of local commerce.<ref name="jstor.org">{{cite journal |last1=Charlier |first1=Roger H. |date=2005 |title=Charlier, Roger H.

A storm in 1134, however, re-established this access, through the creation of a natural channel at the [[Zwin]]. The new sea arm stretched to [[Damme]],<ref name="jstor.org"/> a city that became the commercial outpost for Bruges.

Bruges had a strategic location at the crossroads of the northern [[Hanseatic League]] trade, who had a [[Kontor of Bruges|kontor]] in the city, and the southern trade routes. Bruges was already included in the circuit of the Flemish and French cloth fairs at the beginning of the 13th century, but when the old system of fairs broke down, the entrepreneurs of Bruges innovated. They developed, or borrowed from Italy, new forms of merchant capitalism, whereby several merchants would share the risks and profits and pool their knowledge of markets. They employed new forms of economic exchange, including bills of exchange (i.e. promissory notes) and letters of credit.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mack|last=Ott|title=The Political Economy of Nation Building: The World's Unfinished Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YJyRLypfagYC&pg=PA92|year=2012|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=92|isbn=9781412847421}}</ref>  The city eagerly welcomed foreign traders, most notably the Portuguese traders selling pepper and other spices.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Donald Tracy|title=The Rise of Merchant Empires: Long-Distance Trade in the Early Modern World, 1350-1750|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=heEdZziizrUC&pg=PA263|year=1993|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=263|isbn=9780521457354}}</ref>

With the reawakening of town life in the 12th century, a wool market, a woollens weaving industry, and the cloth market all profited from the shelter of city walls, where surpluses could be safely accumulated under the patronage of the [[Count of Flanders|counts of Flanders]]. The city's entrepreneurs reached out to make economic colonies of England and Scotland's<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nimmo|first1=William|last2=Gillespie|first2=Robert|title=The history of Stirlingshire|date=1880|publisher=Thomas D.

English contacts brought Normandy grain and Gascon wines. [[Hanse]]atic ships filled the harbor, which had to be expanded beyond [[Damme]] to [[Sluys]] to accommodate the new [[Cog (ship)|cog-ships]].

In 1277, the first merchant fleet from the [[Republic of Genoa]] appeared in the port of Bruges, the first of the merchant colony that made Bruges the main link to the trade of the Mediterranean.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CLFQAAAAYAAJ&q=the+first+merchant+fleet+from+Genoa+appeared+in+the+port+of+Bruges,+first+of+the+merchant+colony+that+made+Bruges+the+main+link+to+the+trade+of+the+Mediterranean|title=Bruges and Europe|isbn=9789061532804|last1=Aerts|first1=Erik|year=1992|publisher=Fonds Mercator }}</ref> This development opened not only the trade in spices from the [[Levant]] but also advanced commercial and financial techniques and a flood of capital that soon took over the banking of Bruges.

The [[:wikt:bourse|Bourse]] opened in 1309 (most likely the first [[stock exchange]] in the world) and developed into the most sophisticated money market of the Low Countries in the 14th century. By the time Venetian galleys first appeared, in 1314, they were latecomers.<ref>Braudel, Fernand, ''The Perspective of the World'', in Vol. III ''Civilization and Capitalism'', 1984</ref> Numerous foreign merchants were welcomed in Bruges, such as the Castilian wool merchants who first arrived in the 13th century. After the Castilian wool monopoly ended, [[History of the Basques#Basque sailors|the Basques]], many hailing from [[Bilbao]] (Biscay), thrived as merchants (wool, iron commodities, etc.) and established their own commercial consulate in Bruges by the mid-15th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Roger|title=The Basques|year=1990|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford, UK|page=241|isbn=978-0631175650|edition=2nd}}</ref> The foreign merchants expanded the city's trading zones.

Such wealth gave rise to social upheavals, which were for the most part harshly contained by the militia. In 1302, however, after the [[Bruges Matins (history)|Bruges Matins]] (the night-time massacre of the French garrison in Bruges by the members of the local [[Flanders (county)|Flemish]] [[militia]] on 18 May 1302), the population joined forces with the [[Count of Flanders]] against the [[French people|French]], culminating in the victory at the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs]], fought near [[Kortrijk]] on 11 July. The statue of [[Jan Breydel]] and [[Pieter de Coninck]], the leaders of the uprising, can still be seen on the Big Market square. The city maintained a militia as a permanent paramilitary body. It gained flexibility and high prestige through close ties to a guild of the organized militia, comprising professionals and specialized units. Militia men bought and maintained their own weapons and armour, according to their family status and wealth. Later, Bruges would be consumed in the [[1323–1328 Flemish revolt|Flemish revolts]] that occurred around the County of Flanders between 1323 and 1328.

At the end of the 14th century, Bruges became one of the [[Four Members]], along with [[Brugse Vrije]], [[Ghent]], and [[Ypres]]. Together they formed a parliament; however, they frequently quarrelled amongst themselves.<ref>''Philip the Good: the apogee of Burgundy'' by Richard Vaughan, p201</ref>

In the 15th century, [[Philip III, duke of Burgundy|Philip the Good]], Duke of [[Burgundy]], set up a court in Bruges, as well as [[Brussels]] and [[Lille]], attracting several artists, bankers, and other prominent personalities from all over Europe.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dumolyn | first1 = Jan | year = 2010 | title = 'Our land is only founded on trade and industry.'

The new oil-painting techniques of the [[Flemish school]] gained world renown. The first book in English ever printed was published in Bruges by [[William Caxton]]. [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] and [[Richard III of England]] were then living in exile in Bruges.

[[File:Bruges, Belgium ; Ferraris Map.jpg|thumb|left|Bruges on the [[Ferraris map]], {{Circa|1775}}]]

Starting around 1500, the Zwin channel, (the Golden Inlet) which had given the city its prosperity, began silting up and the Golden Era ended.<ref name="jcronline.org"/> The city soon fell behind [[Antwerp]] as the economic flagship of the [[Low Countries]]. During the 17th century, the [[lace]] industry took off, and various efforts to bring back the glorious past were made. During the 1650s, the city was the base for [[Charles II of England]] and his court in exile.<ref>{{cite web |first=David |last=Plant |url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/biog/charles2.htm |title=Charles, Prince of Wales, (later Charles II), 1630-85 |publisher=British-civil-wars.co.uk |date=10 September 2007 |access-date=7 July 2009 |archive-date=19 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919143610/http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/biog/charles2.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> The maritime infrastructure was modernized, and new connections with the sea were built, but without much success, as Antwerp became increasingly dominant.

The symbolist novelist [[George Rodenbach]] made the city into a character in his novel ''[[Bruges-la-Morte]]'', meaning "Bruges-the-dead", which was adapted into [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]]'s opera, ''[[Die tote Stadt]]'' (The Dead City).<ref>{{cite book|author=Andre de Vries|title=Flanders:A Cultural History: A Cultural History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QvSovOY_VV0C&pg=PA143|year=2007|publisher=Oxford U.P.|page=143|isbn=9780199837335}}</ref>

In the second half of the 19th century, Bruges became one of the world's first tourist destinations, attracting wealthy British and French tourists. By 1909, the 'Bruges Forward: Society to Improve Tourist' association had come into operation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stephen V.

In [[World War I]], German forces occupied Bruges. However, the city suffered virtually no damage, and [[Battle of Courtrai (1918)|was liberated on]] 19 October 1918 by the Allies. The city was occupied by the Germans from 1940 during [[World War II]] and was again spared destruction. On 12 September 1944, it was liberated by the [[12th Manitoba Dragoons]]' Canadian troops. The liberation of the city was facilitated by the bridge, now known as the {{ill|Canada Bridge|nl|Canadabrug}}, connecting the outer municipalities with the city centre.

After 1965, the original medieval city experienced a "renaissance". Restorations of residential and commercial structures, historic monuments, and churches generated a surge in tourism and economic activity in the downtown area. International tourism has boomed, and new efforts resulted in Bruges being designated [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2002. It attracts some eight million tourists annually.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mason |first1=Antony |title=The Belgian city that solved the problem of a tourist invasion |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/belgium/articles/bruges-overtourism/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/belgium/articles/bruges-overtourism/ |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=10 December 2018}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

The [[port of Bruges-Zeebrugge|port of Zeebrugge]] was built in 1907. The Germans used it for their [[U-boat]]s in World War I. It was greatly expanded in the 1970s and early 1980s and has become one of Europe's most important and modern ports.

==Landmarks, arts, and culture==
[[File:Brugge Belfort HDR.jpg|alt=The Belfry of Bruges|thumb|upright=0.8|The [[Belfry of Bruges]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]]]
The [[medieval]] architecture in Bruges is mostly intact, making it one of the best-preserved medieval towns in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iexplore.com/experiences/cultural-exploration/Canal-Towns-to-Visit|title=Skip the Crowds at Venice: 5 Better Canal Towns to Visit|last1=Hahn|first1=Lindsay|website=iExplore.com|date=6 August 2016 |publisher=Inside-Out Media|access-date=25 September 2016}}</ref> The "Historic Centre of Bruges" has been a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] since 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/996|title=Historic Centre of Brugge – UNESCO World Heritage Centre|publisher=Whc.unesco.org|access-date=20 February 2014}}</ref> Its medieval buildings include the [[Church of Our Lady, Bruges|Church of Our Lady]], whose brick [[spire]] reaches {{convert|115.6|m|2|abbr=on}}, making it the world's second-highest brick tower/building. The sculpture ''[[Madonna of Bruges|Madonna and Child]]'', which can be seen in the transept, is believed to be the only of [[Michelangelo]]'s sculptures to have left Italy within his lifetime.

Bruges' best-known landmark is the [[Belfry of Bruges]], a 13th-century [[Belfry (architecture)|belfry]] housing a municipal [[carillon]] comprising 47 bells.<ref name="world & people2">{{cite book|last=Dunton|first=Larkin|url=https://archive.org/details/worldanditspeop05duntgoog|title=The World and Its People|publisher=Silver, Burdett|year=1896|page=[https://archive.org/details/worldanditspeop05duntgoog/page/n169 161]}}</ref> The Belfry of Bruges, independent of the previously mentioned UNESCO World Heritage Site in Bruges, is included on the World Heritage Site of [[Belfries of Belgium and France]].<ref>{{cite web |title=World Heritage List {{!}} Belfries of Belgium and France |work=[[UNESCO]] |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/943 |access-date=16 March 2021}}</ref> The city still employs a full-time [[carillonneur]], who gives free concerts regularly.

In addition to the "Historic Centre of Bruges" and the tower included in the "Belfries of Belgium and France", Bruges is also home to a third UNESCO World Heritage Site; the [[Ten Wijngaerde (Begijnhof Brugge)|Ten Wijngaerde Béguinage]], a [[beguinage]] built in the 13th century, is included in the World Heritage Site of "Flemish Béguinages".

=== Craft ===
Bruges is known for its [[bobbin lace|lace]], a textile technique. Moreover, the city and its lace would go on to inspire the ''[[Thread Routes]]'' film series, the second episode of which, shot in 2011, was partly set in Bruges.<ref>[http://www.heartmus.dk/kimsooja-3472.aspx]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226023659/http://www.heartmus.dk/kimsooja-3472.aspx|date=26 February 2015}}</ref>

Several beers are named after the city, such as ''Brugge Blond'', ''Brugge Tripel'', ''Brugs'', ''Brugse Babbelaar'', ''Brugse Straffe Hendrik'', and ''Brugse Zot''. However, only the latter two—''Brugse Zot'' and ''Brugse Straffe Hendrik'' —are brewed in the city itself, in the [[De Halve Maan|De Halve Maan Brewery]].

===Museums and historic sites (non-religious)===
Bruges is home to many museums. Its art museums include the Arents House, as well as the [[Groeningemuseum]], which has an extensive collection of medieval and early modern art. Members of the 15th century [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] school of painters are represented, including works by [[Jan van Eyck]]. Van Eyck, as well as [[Hans Memling]], lived and worked in Bruges.

The preserved old city gateways: the ''[[Kruispoort]]'', the ''[[Gentpoort]]'', the ''[[Smedenpoort]]'' and the ''[[Ezelpoort]]''. The ''[[Dampoort (Bruges)|Dampoort]]'', the ''[[Katelijnepoort]]'' and the ''[[Boeveriepoort]]'' are gone.

The [[Old St. John's Hospital]] (Hans Memling museum) and Our Lady of the Potteries are [[Hospital museum]]s. The city is known for ''Bruggemuseum'' ("Bruges Museum"), the general name for a group of 11 different historical museums in the city, including:

* [[Gruuthusemuseum]], a museum for the house of [[Louis de Gruuthuse]].
* Archaeological Museum
* Gentpoort

=== Religion and religious landmarks ===
The [[patron saint]] of both the city of Bruges and the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Bruges]] is [[Donatian of Reims]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://catholicsaints.info/saint-donatian-of-rheims/|title=Saint Donatian of Rheims|date=17 November 2023|publisher=CatholicSaints.info|access-date=13 December 2023}}</ref> The [[St. Salvator's Cathedral]] is therefore also known as ''Cathedral of the Saviour and St. Donat''.

The [[Basilica of the Holy Blood]] ({{langx|nl|Heilig-Bloedbasiliek}}) houses the relic of the [[Blood of Christ|Holy Blood]], which was brought to the city after the [[Second Crusade]] by [[Thierry of Alsace]], and is paraded every year through the streets of the city. More than 1,600 inhabitants take part in this mile-long religious [[Procession of the Holy Blood|procession]], many dressed as medieval knights or crusaders.

Other religious landmarks and museums include the [[Church of Our Lady, Bruges|Church of Our Lady]], English Convent, Jerusalem Church, [[St. Trudo's Abbey, Bruges|St. Trudo's Abbey]], [[Ten Wijngaerde (Bruges Béguinage)|Ten Wijngaerde Béguinage]] ({{langx|nl|Begijnhof}}), and [[Ter Doest Abbey]] ({{langx|nl|Abdij Ter Doest}}) in [[Lissewege]].

The sub-municipality (or [[deelgemeente]]) and former [[parish]] of Bruges [[Sint-Andries]] has its own patron saint [[Andrew the Apostle]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-andrew-the-apostle|title=Blog Archive » Saint Andrew the Apostle|date=27 February 2009|publisher=SQPN.com|access-date=20 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://emmausparochie.be/emmausparochie/geschiedenis-van-de-parochie-sint-andreas-en-sint-anna-en-haar-kerk/|title=Geschiedenis van de parochie Sint-Andreas en Sint-Anna en haar kerk|date=31 May 2015 |access-date=13 December 2023}}</ref> to which the parish [[Church of St. Andrew & St. Anna]] is dedicated.

==Transport==
[[File:cmglee_Bruges_Boudewijnkanaal_aerial.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Aerial view of the Boudewijnkanaal canal linking Zeebrugge (top) with Bruges (middle)]]

===Road===
Bruges has motorway connections in all directions:
* [[File:BE-A10.svg|40px|A10 road (Belgium)]] to [[Ostend]]
* [[File:BE-A10.svg|40px|A10 road (Belgium)]] [[File:Tabliczka E40.svg|40px|European route E40]] to [[Ghent]] and [[Brussels]]
* [[File:BE-A18.svg|40px|A18 road (Belgium)]] [[File:Tabliczka E40.svg|40px|European route E40]] to [[Veurne]] and France
* [[File:BE-A17.svg|40px|A17 road (Belgium)]] [[File:Tabliczka E403.svg|40px|European route E403]] to [[Kortrijk]] and [[Tournai]]
* [[File:BE-N31.svg|40px|N31 road (Belgium)]] [[File:Tabliczka E403.svg|40px|European route E403]] to [[Zeebrugge]]
* [[File:BE-N49.svg|40px|N49 road (Belgium)]] [[File:Tabliczka E34.svg|40px|European route E34]] to [[Antwerp]]

Driving within the 'egg', the historical centre enclosed by the main circle of canals in Bruges is discouraged by traffic management schemes, including a network of one-way streets. The system encourages the use of set routes leading to central car parks and direct exit routes. The car parks are convenient for the central commercial and tourist areas; they are not expensive.

===Railway===
[[Brugge main railway station|Bruges' main railway station]] is the focus of lines to the Belgian coast. It also provides at least hourly trains to all other major cities in Belgium, as well as to [[Lille]] in France.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bemarietravels.com/how-to-get-to-bruges-by-train-flight-bus-and-ferry/|title=How To Get To Bruges|date=6 September 2018}}</ref> Further there are several regional and local trains.

A third track is being constructed between Bruges and Dudzele, the junction for Zeebrugge to alleviate congestion. Similarly, two extra tracks are being built between Bruges and Ghent.<ref>{{cite web |title=Axis between Ghent ant the coast |url=https://www.tucrail.be/en/projects/new-infrastructure/axis-between-ghent-ant-coast |website=TUC rail |access-date=12 February 2023}}</ref>

Bus links to the centre are frequent, though the railway station is just a 10-minute walk from the main shopping streets and a 20-minute walk from Market Square.

===Air===
The national [[Brussels Airport]], one hour away by train or car, offers the best connections. The nearest airport is the [[Ostend-Bruges International Airport]] in Ostend (around {{convert|25|km|0|abbr=off}} from the city centre of Bruges), but it offers limited passenger transport and connections. Recently there also started a direct bus line from [[Brussels South Charleroi Airport]] to Bruges.

===Public city transport===
[[File:Busstationtzandbrugge.jpg|thumb|{{Interlanguage link|'t Zand (Brugge)|nl|lt='t Zand}} bus station]]
Bruges has an extensive web of bus lines, operated by ''[[De Lijn]]'', providing access to the city centre and the suburbs (city lines, {{langx|nl|stadslijnen}}) and to many towns and villages in the region around the city (regional lines, {{langx|nl|streeklijnen}}).

In support of the municipal [[:Category:Road traffic management|traffic management]] (see "Road" above), [[free public transport]] is available for those who park their cars in the main railway station car park.

===Cycling===
Although a few streets are restricted, no part of Bruges is car-free.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitbruges.be/car|title=Car|website=Visit Bruges}}</ref>

Cars are required to yield to pedestrians and cyclists. Plans have long been underway to ban cars altogether from the historic center of Bruges or to restrict traffic much more than it currently is, but these plans have yet to come to fruition. In 2005, signs were changed for the convenience of cyclists, allowing two-way cycle traffic on more streets; however, car traffic has not decreased. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Nevertheless, in common with many cities in the region, there are thousands of cyclists in the city of Bruges. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Port===
[[File:Elly Maersk.jpg|thumb|The ''Elly Mærsk'', at Zeebrugge, one of the world's largest container ships]]

{{Main|Seaport of Bruges}}
The port of Bruges is [[Zeebrugge]] (Flemish for Bruges-on-Sea).

On 6 March 1987, the British ferry [[MS Herald of Free Enterprise|MS ''Herald of Free Enterprise'']] [[Capsizing|capsized]] after leaving the port, killing 187 people, in the worst disaster involving a British civilian vessel since 1919; it had set sail with its bow door open.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maib.gov.uk/cms_resources.cfm?file=/HofFEfinal.pdf |title=The Merchant Shipping Act : mv Herald of Free Enterprise : Formal Investigation |publisher=Maib.gov.uk |access-date=20 February 2014}}</ref> The Herald of Free Enterprise was a passenger ship bound for the [[Port of Dover]] in [[Kent]]. Most of the occupants had taken advantage of a newspaper promotion offering a £1 return trip from Dover to [[Zeebrugge]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=6 March 2017|title=Zeebrugge ferry disaster marked 30 years on|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-39177104|access-date=8 November 2021}}</ref>

== Demographics==
Brugge is the sixth most populous city in the country after [[Brussels]], [[Antwerp]], [[Charleroi]], [[Liège]], and [[Ghent]].

==Sports==
[[File:Panoramio - V&A Dudush - Jan Breydel Stadion.jpg|thumb|left|Jan Breydel Stadium]]
Between 1998 and 2016, Bruges hosted the start of the annual ''[[Tour of Flanders]]'' cycle race, held in April and one of the biggest sporting events in Belgium.

[[football (soccer)|Football]] is also popular in Bruges; the city hosts two professional football teams, both of which play at the top level ([[Belgian First Division]]) [[Club Brugge K.V.]] are the current national champions, while the second team, [[Cercle Brugge K.S.V.]], was recently promoted to the first tier. Both teams play their home games at the [[Jan Breydel Stadium]] (30,000 seats) in [[Sint-Andries]]. There are plans for a new stadium for Club Brugge with about 45,000 seats in the north of the city, while the city council would renovate and reduce the capacity of the Jan Breydel Stadium for Cercle Brugge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.voetbalkrant.com/nl/nieuws/lees/2015-10-22/het-nieuwe-stadion-van-club-brugge-krijgt-steeds-meer-vorm|title=Club Brugge krijgt schitterend nieuws in verband met nieuw stadion|date=22 October 2015}}</ref>

In 2000, Bruges was one of the eight host cities for the [[UEFA Euro 2000|UEFA European Football Championship]], co-hosted by Belgium and its neighbour the Netherlands.

In 2021, Bruges, along with [[Leuven]], hosted the [[2021 UCI Road World Championships|UCI Road World Championships]].
[[File:KHBO St-Michiels Brugge.jpg|thumb|The [[Katholieke Hogeschool Vives Noord|KHBO]] campus in Sint-Michiels]]

==Education==
Bruges is a centre for education in West Flanders. Next to the several common primary and secondary schools, there are a few colleges, like the VIVES (a fusion of the former KHBO (Katholieke Hogeschool Brugge Oostende) and the KATHO (katholieke hogeschool) or the [[Hogeschool West-Vlaanderen|HOWEST]] (''Hogeschool West-Vlaanderen''). Furthermore, the city is home to the [[College of Europe]], a prestigious institution of postgraduate studies in European [[Economics]], Law, and [[Politics]], and of the [[UNU-CRIS|United Nations University Institute on Comparative Regional Integration Studies (UNU-CRIS)]], a Research and Training Institute<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unu.edu/system/centres.html|title=Training Centres and Programmes - United Nations University|first=United Nations|last=University}}</ref> of the [[United Nations University]] specialising in the comparative study of [[regional integration]].

==Town twinning policy==
Bruges has never formally ratified any [[twin towns and sister cities]]  collaboration. In the 1950s, Bruges refused a ''jumelage'' with [[Nice]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Locarno]] and [[Venice]] that had been signed by a Belgian ambassador without consultation. The twinning between some of the former municipalities, merged with Bruges in 1971, was discontinued.

Bruges has had the following international contacts:
