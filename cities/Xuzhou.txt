== History ==

=== Early history ===
The early prehistoric relics around Xuzhou are classified as [[Dawenkou culture]] system. Liulin ({{lang|zh-hant|劉林}}) site together with Dadunzi ({{lang|zh-hant|大墩子}}) site, Huating ({{lang|zh-hant|花廳}}) site, and Liangwangcheng ({{lang|zh-hant|梁王城}}) site correspond to the initial, middle and late stages of this culture, respectively.<ref>{{Cite journal|script-title=zh:江苏邳州梁王城遗址大汶口文化遗存发掘简报 |trans-title=Brief Excavation Report of the Remains of Dawenkou Culture at the Site of Liangwangcheng in Pizhou, Jiangsu |url=http://dnwh.njmuseum.com/pdf/2013/201304/20130404.pdf |script-journal=zh:东南文化 |journal=Southeast Culture |volume=2013|issue=4|pages=21–41|access-date=2017-04-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904013809/http://dnwh.njmuseum.com/pdf/2013/201304/20130404.pdf|archive-date=2017-09-04|url-status=live}}</ref> While the remains of sacrificial rituals performed to [[Tudigong|Tudi]] deity found at Qiuwan ({{lang|zh-hant|丘灣}}) site and Gaohuangmiao ({{lang|zh-hant|高皇廟}}) site, both of them are in the outskirts of the city, indicate that [[Shang dynasty]] affected the area.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yu|first=Weichao|script-title=zh:銅山丘湾商代社祀遗迹的推定|journal=考古 (Archaeology)|volume=1973|issue=5|pages=296–298}}</ref> History relates that Peng or Great Peng, the transitions from a tribe to a chiefdom contained within the boundary of the city. [[Peng Zu]] is believed to be the first chief of the ancient [[Dapeng (state)|Peng state]] that was centered around Xuzhou, while the state was eventually conquered by [[Wu Ding|King Wu Ding of Shang]] in around 1208 BC.<ref>{{Cite book|script-title=zh:竹書紀年|trans-title=[[Bamboo Annals]]|quote={{lang|zh|武丁…四十三年，王師滅大彭}}}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|script-title=zh:國語 [[Guoyu (book)|Guoyu]]|trans-title=Discourses of the States|quote={{lang|zh-Hant|彭、豕韋為商伯矣。當週未有…彭姓彭祖、豕韋、諸稽，則商滅之矣}}}}</ref>

During the time of [[Western Zhou]], a [[Dongyi|Huaiyi]] chiefdom called [[Xu (state)|Xuyi or Xu]] rose centered around modern Xuzhou and controlled the Lower Yellow River Valley. Xuyi with its [[Dongyi|Huaiyi people]] fought against Zhou and its vassals at irregular intervals. Since its declining, Xuyi once moved the capital to the area of Xuzhou and populated it with people who were migrated southwards.

'''Pengcheng''', named after the ancient [[Dapeng (state)|Peng state]] that was centered around Xuzhou, a city at the junction of the ancient Bian and Si Rivers, was founded by [[Lu (state)|Lü]] (annexed by [[Song (state)|Song]] later). [[Chu (state)|Chu]] took the city in the war of 573 BCE, but ceded the city back to Song in the next year, as a coercive measure.{{sfnp|Ji|2008|p=8}}

=== Imperial China ===
In 208 BC, [[Xiang Yu]] and Liu Bang deployed their troops into Pengcheng, where [[Emperor Yi of Chu]] later transferred his capital from [[Xuyi County|Xuyi]] after rebel leader [[Xiang Liang]]'s death.{{sfnp|Ji|2008|p=17}}{{sfnp|Twitchett, Loewe|1987|p=114}} Xiang Yu then exiled the emperor to southern China in 206 BC, the former proclaiming himself as "Hegemon-King of Western Chu", and also establishing his capital in Pengcheng, until 202 BC.

During the [[Han dynasty]], a new [[Chu Kingdom (Han dynasty)|Chu Kingdom]] was established with its capital at Pengcheng. It was ruled by various imperial princes during the Western Han period (202 BC – 9 AD). [[Liu Jiao (prince)|Liu Jiao]], the younger half-brother of [[Liu Bang]], founder of Western Han, became the first Prince of Chu. In 154 BC, the prince [[Liu Wu, Prince of Chu|Liu Wu]] participated in the [[Rebellion of the Seven Princes]]. However, he was defeated afterwards and Chu's territories were greatly diminished. By the end of the second century, a prosperous Buddhist community had been settled at Pengcheng.{{sfnp|Twitchett, Loewe|1987|p=670}}

At the turn of the second century, Pengcheng changed hands several times among [[Cao Cao]] and his rivals before being annexed to Cao Wei in about 200. In the intervening years, the seat of Xuzhou (Xu province) was transferred from [[Tancheng County|Tancheng]] to Xiapi, which located in the northwest of Suining. While Pengcheng became the seat later than 220.

With the [[Upheaval of the Five Barbarians|rebellions of the Five Barbarians]], considerable local households migrated to the south, a Liu clan from Pengcheng ascended to the gentry, its most well known descendant is Liu Yu, the [[Emperor Wu of Liu Song]]. Pengcheng was taken by the Northern dynasties later. Liu Yu recaptured the lost territory in the north of the Huai River in about 408. Xuzhou was divided into two parts: Beixuzhou (North Xuzhou) and Xuzhou (with [[Zhenjiang|Jingkou]] as its seat) in 411. North Xuzhou whose seat was Pengcheng bounded on the south by the Huai River. Beixuzhou was restored as Xuzhou a decade later, while its south counterpart was renamed Nanxuzhou (South Xuzhou). Since then, Pengcheng remained being the seat of Xuzhou until it was eliminated in the early Ming.

The raging wars inflicted upon Xuzhou until the Emperor Taizong of Tang's enthronement in 626. Keeping the northern rebellions and warfare a distance gave Xuzhou scope for developing during the most period of the [[Tang dynasty]]. According to the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' and the [[New Book of Tang|''New book of Tang'']], in 639, the total population of Pengcheng County, Fei County and Pei County was only 21,768, versus 205,286 in 742.<ref name=":1" />

In 781, [[Li Na (Tang dynasty)|Li Na]]  marched south to besiege Xuzhou. Although his revolt was quell soon, the halt of the transport by the Bian Canal impelled the court to secure the area.{{sfnp|Twitchett|2007|p=593}}

The then prefect of Xuzhou, [[Zhang Jianfeng]] was designated as the first military governor of Xuzhou&ndash;Sizhou&ndash;Haozhou ({{lang|zh-Hant|徐泗濠節度使}}) which was headquartered in Xuzhou since 788. The title was restored and renamed Wuning ({{lang|zh-Hant|武寧}}) in 805, after an interval of five years. Wang Zhixing, another military governor of Wuning, established several battalions (the most notorious one among is the Silver Sword) in the Army specifically for select recruits. These soldiers not only defy military discipline but also show defiant towards the successors to Wang. In 832, Li Ting received a threatening letter prior to his induction in there, made him resigned immediately.{{sfnp|Twitchett|2007|p=541}} Then Wuning suffered mutinies in 849, 859 and again in 862.{{sfnp|Twitchett|2007|p=687, 697}} Another two governors were expelled.{{sfnp|Twitchett|2007|p=516, 557}} [[Wang Shi (Tang dynasty)|Wang Shi]]  was appointed, under the circumstances. He put the mutiny down by executing part of the garrison troops and disbanded the rest, which became thugs and loot later. In 864, the court declared an amnesty in the area, and promised that all thugs who willingly re-enrolled would be sent for a tour of duty in the southern, and then, presumably, returned to regular army service in the north.{{sfnp|Twitchett|2007|p=558, 697}}

Three thousand men surrendered and were sent to the south to join the two thousand former Wuning soldiers there. The breached pledge irritated them. Led by [[Pang Xun]], some soldiers mutinied and marched back north.{{sfnp|Twitchett|2007|p=696}} They have unimpeded access to the area by the winter of 868.{{sfnp|Twitchett|2007|p=697}} The local civil governor refused Pang's demand to have the hatred officers removed, and a military confrontation ensued. Thousands of local peasants joined the rebels. They took the prefectural city of Xuzhou, captured the civil governor, and killed those officers. Pang acquired a considerable following. Still, the rebellion was suppressed a year later eventually. Wuning was renamed '''Ganhua''' ({{zh|labels=no|c=感化 |l="Converting [from insubordination]"}}) with admonishment on lest the garrison to revolt again.{{sfnp|Twitchett|2007|p=727}}

After the [[Yellow River]] began to change course during the [[Song dynasty]], heavy silting at the Yellow River estuary forced the river to channel its flow into the lower Huai River tributary. The area became barren thereafter due to persistent flooding, nutrient depletion and salination of the once fertile soil.

In the first month of 1129, Nijuhun took the city after a siege of 27 days, and the then governor Wang Fu ({{lang|zh-hant|王復}}) was executed for refusing to submit. Wang's inferior Zhao Li ({{lang|zh-hant|趙立}}) rallied the remains and constructed a local militia. They recaptured the city two months later but withdrew from there strategically soon. Henceforth, Xuzhou was ruled by Jurchen over a century.<ref>''[[History of Song (Yuan dynasty)|History of Song]]''. '''25'''.

A rebellion against Yuan rose by Li Er ({{lang|zh|李二}}) who was nicknamed Sesame Li in the area around Xuzhou.  In the eighth month of 1351, they took the city. [[Toghon Temür]] gave an edict that they would be granted amnesty if they surrendered to the authority, in the spring of the next year.

Xuzhou had a long period of prosperity during the Ming dynasty. The flourishness largely attributed to the carriage, especially by the Grand Canal,{{sfnp|Twitchett, Mote|1998|p=598}} one of seven customs barriers (or customs houses, {{lang|zh-hant|鈔關}}) under the Ministry of Revenue was located in Xuzhou.{{sfnp|Twitchett, Mote|1998|p=603}} It was retained until the late Qing.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of China, Vol. 9: The Ch'ing Empire to 1800, Part I|last=Peterson|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0-521-24334-3|pages=647}}</ref> Korean [[Choe Bu]] affirmed that the city where he travelled by way of, hardly pale by comparison to the [[Jiangnan|Jiangnan region]].<ref>{{Cite book |script-title=zh:錦南漂海錄|volume=3|trans-title=A Record of Drifting Across the Southern Brocade Sea |quote={{lang|zh-hant|江以北，若揚州、淮安，及淮河以北，若徐州、濟寧、臨清，繁華豐阜，無異江南，臨清為尤盛}}}}</ref>

As a hub for both the national courier system and the grain tribute system for several centuries, Xuzhou was of vital importance.{{sfnp|Twitchett, Mote|1998|p=590}} Thus, the government of Ming established three garrison areas namely guards in the present-day area: Xuzhou guard ({{lang|zh-hant|徐州衛}}), Xuzhou Left guard ({{lang|zh-hant|徐州左衛}}) and Pizhou guard ({{lang|zh-hant|邳州衛}}) for its security.

Yet, the local navigation was considerably constrained by two Rapids: the Xuzhou Rapids ({{lang|zh-hant|徐州洪}}), a kilometer southeast of the city, and the Lüliang Rapids ({{lang|zh-hant|呂梁洪}}), another 24 kilometers further south.{{sfnp|Twitchett, Mote|1998|p=599}} The remedy provided by the Ministry of Works is constructing the [[Ji Canal River|Jia Canal]], which paralleled the treacherous stretch of Xuzhou. However, the canal completed in the 1600s ravaged the city. Not only it disrupted the former drainage system, but also depressed the local economy.<ref>{{Cite book|script-title=zh:萬曆野獲編|last=Shen|first=Defu|volume=12|trans-title=Unofficial Gleanings from the Wanli Era|quote={{lang|zh-Hant|徐州卑濕，自堤上視之，如居釜底，與汴梁相似；而堤之堅厚重復，十不得汴二三餘見彼中故老，皆云目中已三見漂溺。須急徒城於高阜，如雲龍、子房等山，皆善地可版築，不然終有其魚之歎。又城下洪河，為古今孔道，自通泇後，軍民二運，俱不復經。商賈散徒，井邑蕭條，全不似一都會}}}}</ref> Prior to the recession, flooding and the famines followed struck Xuzhou frequently.<ref>For instances, in 1453, see ''History of Ming''.

After the [[Zhu Yousong|Hongguang Emperor]] enthroned in Nanjing, the court designated four defense areas along the southern bank of the Yellow River ({{lang|zh-hant|江北四鎮}}) to repulse the Qing armies. While the former bandit general, Gao Jie ({{lang|zh-hant|高傑}}) was designated to take the crucial forward position at Xuzhou by [[Shi Kefa]].{{sfnp|Mote, Twitchett|2007|p=633}}  But the assassination of Gao seriously reduced the court's capacity to deal with challenges from Qing.{{sfnp|Mote, Twitchett|2007|p=656}} Gao's successor was Li Chengdong ({{lang|zh-hant|李成棟}}). Being aware of forthcoming attack, Li deserted Xuzhou in the early summer of 1645. Then [[Dodo (prince)|Dodo]]'s army captured the city.

In the 1850s, the Yellow River shifted its course from the southern to the northern side of the [[Shandong Peninsula|Shandong peninsula]], the process caused serious floods and famine in Xuzhou, and almost made the waterway system within the prefecture defunct.

=== Modern China ===

[[Zhang Xun]] and his remaining army fled to Xuzhou after the [[Xinhai Revolution|Revolution of 1911]]. They entered the city on 5 December. The Nanking Government sent three armies to attack Xuzhou. In the middle of February 1912, Zhang evacuated the city and moved north after he was defeated.

Since the Second Revolution began, Xuzhou became a front-line city. The Revolutionary Army fared badly as it advanced from there towards the north, and a rout ensued. Then the [[Beiyang Army]] captured the city on 24 July. Thereafter, Zhang Xun made Xuzhou his base. he convened four meetings of the Beiyang leadership. Involved the stalemate among [[Li Yuanhong]] and [[Duan Qirui]] in 1917, he marched on Beijing with a troop in June. His failure spread and caused a terrible wave of theft and arson committed by his garrisons later in Xuzhou in July.

The Zhili clique dominated Xuzhou by 1924. In the autumn of this year, the Second Zhili–Fengtian War broke out, Zhang Zongchang who supported the Fengtian clique seized the city with his thirty thousand soldiers. Sun Chuanfang led a coalition of forces to sortie the [[Fengtian Army]] in October 1925. They occupied the city on 8 November. As the leader of the [[Northern Expedition]], [[Chiang Kai-shek]] arrived in Xuzhou on 17 June 1927.{{sfnp|Fairbank|2005|p=651}} He conferred with [[Feng Yuxiang]] and other Kuomintang officers on 20 June, Feng was courted by Nanjing.{{sfnp|Fairbank|2005|p=665}} Then [[Sun Chuanfang]] and [[Zhang Zongchang]] began to fight in unison against the Nationalist government. They captured the city on 24 June. The fall of Xuzhou aroused public outrage, Chiang 's first resignation ensued. On 16 December, Nanjing force took the area again.{{sfnp|Fairbank|2005|p=700}}

The area was the main site both of the [[Battle of Xuzhou]] in 1938 against the Japanese Army in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and of the battle in the [[Chinese Civil War]], the [[Huaihai Campaign]] in 1948–49.

On 19 May 1938, Chiang gave the order to abandon Xuzhou, then Japanese military took control of the city.

The Administrative Commission of the Su-Huai Special Region ({{lang|zh-hant|蘇淮特別區}}) was established in January 1942, with its seat at Xuzhou. It was replaced by a new puppet province, Huaihai ({{lang|zh-hant|淮海省}}). [[Hao Pengju]] was appointed as the governor.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Jiangsu Provincial Chorographies: Civil Administration Chorography|publisher=China Local Records Publishing|year=2002|location=Beijing}}</ref>

After the Second Sino-Japanese War, the troop under He Zhuguo entered Xuzhou on 6 September. The Xuzhou Pacification Commission ({{lang|zh-hant|徐州綏靖公署}}) was founded in the end of year, and Gu Zhutong was appointed as the Chief. It was disbanded when the Army Command Headquarters of transferred to Xuzhou on 5 March 1947. Meantime, a military tribunal attached to the commission was organized to sentence 25 Japanese soldiers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://xzzy.chinacourt.org/article/detail/2015/09/id/2118397.shtml|script-title=zh:徐州绥靖公署军事法庭审判日本战犯回顾(in Chinese)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226220346/http://xzzy.chinacourt.org/article/detail/2015/09/id/2118397.shtml|archive-date=2016-12-26|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dz.xdkb.net/html/2015-08/27/content_410139.htm|script-title=zh:不能忘却的审判 |language=zh-cn |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226221611/http://dz.xdkb.net/html/2015-08/27/content_410139.htm|archive-date=2016-12-26|url-status=live}}</ref>

Guo Yingqiu as the representative of the CPC went to Xuzhou to negotiate a regional truce, since 10 February 1946. On 2 March, the "Committee of Three", comprising George Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong and Zhou Enlai arrived for the ceasefire in Central China. Still, the KMT and the CPC came into conflict soon. The CPC revealed that [[Yasuji Okamura]] assisted the KMT in the local warfare against the PLA.

The [[Huaihai Campaign|Huaihai]] was the a critical of the trinity of the major campaigns during the Chinese Civil War. Fighting centred around the city of Xuzhou, seat of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters ({{lang|zh-hant|剿匪總司令部}}) established on 6 June 1948. It turned into a fiasco, which led to the fall of the Nationalist Chinese capital Nanjing.<ref name="life">"[https://books.google.com/books?id=i0oEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA44 Battle of Suchow]".

Then Xuzhou (the old urban area) was made a part of Shandong province temporarily, together with the rest area of the northern Jiangsu along the Longhai Railway. The city was returned to Jiangsu as the province was restored in 1953.

The railways in Xuzhou bore the brunt of the transporting muddle in the 1970s, Beijing was concerned with the issue in 1974. Thus, the then Minister of Railways, [[Wan Li]] went to Xuzhou to inspect and rectify in March. It was deemed as a breakthrough on restoring order later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.china-railway.com.cn/qywh/tlsh/201612/t20161216_61985.html|script-title=zh:万里同志与1975年铁路整顿|website=China Railway|language=zh|access-date=2018-01-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126185409/http://www.china-railway.com.cn/qywh/tlsh/201612/t20161216_61985.html|archive-date=2018-01-26|url-status=live}}</ref>

Xuzhou is of strategic importance for linking South China and North China. The boundaries of its jurisdiction are adjacent to [[Lianyungang]] and [[Suqian]] in east; [[Suzhou, Anhui|Suzhou]] of Anhui province to the south; [[Huaibei]] to the west; [[Linyi]], [[Zaozhuang]], [[Jining]] and [[Heze]] of [[Shandong]] province to the north.

The area can be divided into four sectors from east to west, constitute the Shandong&ndash;Jiangsu Traps ({{lang|zh-Hans|鲁苏地盾}}), the Tancheng&ndash;Lujiang Fault Zone ({{lang|zh-Hans|郯庐断裂带}}), the Xu&ndash;Huai Downwarp-fold Belt ({{lang|zh-Hans|徐淮坳褶带}}) and the Fault-block of West Shandong ({{lang|zh-Hans|鲁西断块}}) respectively. Most of the area is located in the Xu-Huai Alluvial Plain, the southeast part of the [[North China Plain]].

The confluence of the former [[Si River]] and the former Bian Canal was situated northeast of ancient Xuzhou city. The city and its hinterland were areas liable to severe flooding from the Yellow River since the tenth century. In 1194, the Yellow River changed its course to join the Si River, a former tributary of the Huai. From then on, the Yellow River flowed along the north of the walled city until diverting in 1855. The city proper is now bisected by the ancient Yellow River course, while [[Yunlong Lake]] is located in the southwest. North of the lake is [[Yunlong Park]].

=== Climate ===
Xuzhou has a [[monsoon]]-influenced [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cwa''), with cool, dry winters, warm springs, long, hot and humid summers, and crisp autumns. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from {{convert|0.7|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|27.3|°C|1}} in July; the annual mean is {{convert|14.9|°C|1}}. Snow may occur during winter, though rarely heavily. Precipitation is light in winter, and a majority of the annual total of {{convert|842.8|mm|in|1}} occurs from June thru August. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 44% in July to 54% in three months, the city receives 2,221 hours of bright sunshine annually.

The lowest temperature recorded in Xuzhou was {{convert|−23.3|°C|0}}, on 6 February 1969, while the highest was {{convert|43.4|°C|0}}, on 15 July 1955.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yss.gov.cn/WebMain/JieShao/Default.aspx?ModuleId=15|script-title=zh:沂沭泗流域介绍 |language=zh-cn |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916221152/http://www.yss.gov.cn/WebMain/JieShao/Default.aspx?ModuleId=15|archive-date=2013-09-16|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Economy ==
Historically, Xuzhou and the surrounding regions were a predominantly agricultural area. Its arable land was severely depleted by the changes in the course of the Yellow River since the mid 11th century, and the drought-resistant crops: wheat, sorghum, soybean, maize and potato, became the local staples. Besides, cotton, peanut, tobacco and sesame also grew in low-yield. The local mining traces it origins to an iron mine, Liguo. It was exploited since Han dynasty, and managed by a particular bureau in Song. And the city had major coal reserves of the province.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title="Jiangsu Provincial Geography" (in Chinese)|publisher=Beijing Normal University Publishing Group|year=2011|isbn=9787303131686|location=Beijing}}</ref> Local coaling began by the 1070s, according to a lyric of the then governor [[Su Shi]].<ref>{{Cite book|script-title=zh:蘇軾詩詞合注|last=Feng|first=Yingliu|year=2001|isbn=9787532526529|location=Shanghai|pages=878|trans-title=Commentary to an Integrator of Several Versions of the Collection of Su Shi's Poetry and Lyrics|script-chapter=zh:石炭|quote={{lang|zh-Hant|彭城舊無石炭。元豐元年十二月，始遣人訪獲於州之西南白土鎮之北，冶鐵作兵}}}}</ref> Copper smelting in this area supposedly started in the Three Kingdoms era.<ref>A triangle-edge copper mirror with carved divine beasts unearthed at the {{Nihongo|Kurozuka Kofun|[[:ja:黒塚古墳|黒塚古墳]]}}, Tenri, Japan, bore "{{lang|zh-Hant|銅出徐州；師出洛陽}} [Copper from Xuzhou; craftsman from Luoyang]".</ref>

The city astride the old course of the Grand Canal had been through several transitory periods of prosperity, before the grain tribute system was abolished in 1855. It remained being economically backward in the 1940s for wars, and a few people engaged in industrial sectors.

Later the CPC positioned the city as a region of coal mining and heavy industry. Its dominant sectors are machinery, energy and food production nowadays. The construction machinery manufacturer [[XCMG]] is the largest company based in Xuzhou. It was the world's tenth-largest construction equipment maker measured by 2011 revenues, and the third-largest based in China (after [[Sany]] and [[Zoomlion]]).<ref name="reut8312">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-construction-idUSBRE8270CP20120308|title=Analysis: China's budding Caterpillars break new ground overseas|access-date=8 March 2012|publisher=Reuters|date=8 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308190353/http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/08/us-china-construction-idUSBRE8270CP20120308|archive-date=8 March 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

Xuzhou is deemed one of earlier Buddhist centres in China supposedly because the Emperor Ming of Han mentioned that the then Prince of Chu Liu Ying built a "temple for Buddha".<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of the Later Han|volume=42|quote={{lang|zh-hant|詔報曰：「楚王誦黃老之微言，尚浮屠之仁祠，絜齋三月，與神為誓，何嫌何疑，當有悔吝？其還贖，以助伊蒲塞桑門之盛饌。」}}}}</ref>

Jones of BMS, then American Southern Presbyterian Mission took over it in the 1890s.

[[Shanxi merchants]] popularized Bangzi in Xuzhou afterwards, since it was introduced in the late Ming along the Great Cannel. Fused the local ballads in dialect, this localized version evolved into a new opera over the following centuries. The opera was designated as Jiangsu Bangzi ({{lang|zh-hant|江蘇梆子}}) in 1962.

The new municipal concert hall was opened in 2011, shaped like a myrtle flower. However, the various regular performances are unattainable. While the first local philharmonic orchestra is established in 2015.
