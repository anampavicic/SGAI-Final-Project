'''Teixeira de Freitas''' is a city in the extreme south of the Brazilian [[States of Brazil|state]] of [[Bahia]], on the margins of BR-101 highway.

==History==
The city had its origin as a crossroads, and has always maintained its character as a place that draws [[entrepreneur]]s from other regions. Major expansion of industry in the area, combined with the growth of [[eucalyptus]] plantations, has adversely impacted [[small-scale agriculture]] in the surrounding rural areas, resulting in declining population in those rural areas.  Teixeira de Freitas has also a busy commercial district and the economy has developed a lot lately thanks to the migration of the population from surrounding towns.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

==Economy==
[[image:Shopping PátioMix Teixeira de Freitas.jpg|thumb|190px|Shopping PátioMix Teixeira de Freitas]]
