'''Ibarra''' ({{IPA|es|iˈβara}}; full name '''San Miguel de Ibarra'''; [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]]: Impapura) is a city in northern [[Ecuador]] and the capital of the [[Imbabura Province]]. It lies at the foot of the [[Imbabura Volcano]] and on the left bank of the [[Tahuando]] river. It is located about {{convert|70|km|mi}} northeast of Ecuador's capital [[Quito]].

==History==
Ibarra was founded in 1606 by order of the President of the [[Royal Audience of Quito]], Miguel de Ibarra. The development of the city included the systematic construction of public buildings, including an important number of [[Church (building)|church]]es, ⁣⁣but an [[1868 Ecuador earthquakes|earthquake in 1868]] destroyed most of them.  After the devastating earthquake of August 16, 1868, the city was re-settled in 1872. Based on its newest date of foundation, Ibarra is the youngest city in Ecuador.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}} The [[Inca]] ruler [[Atahualpa]] is said to have been born in the Inca settlement of [[Inca-Caranqui]] about 2&nbsp;km from the city.

Helados de paila (handmade [[ice cream]] or [[sorbet]] and still sold in the markets today) was first made in Ibarra during [[Inca]]n times (but not by Incas; by the native indigenous), using snow or ice from the nearby [[Imbabura Volcano]] (which is no longer snow bound). Using a large bronze pan surrounded by [[ice shavings]], the juices of various fruits are stirred into the pan to freeze.

==Ibarra today==
Today, Ibarra is a mid-sized [[Market (place)|market]] city rising in popularity with [[tourism|tourists]], yet still retains a very authentic Ecuadorian vibe. It has a unique ethnic composition for Ecuador, with the population being a mix of Mestizos, Amerindians (mostly [[Otavalo people]]), and [[Afro-Ecuadorians]]. Ibarra is known for its mild weather, colonial whitewashed houses (giving it the nickname The White City), and cobbled streets.<ref>[http://www.vivatravelguides.com/south-america/ecuador/andean-highlands/northern-andes/ibarra/ viva travel guides: Ibarra]</ref> The Santo Domingo church houses a museum holding paintings. The town is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ibarra]].

Markets are on Saturdays, and the main [[festival]] is the ''Fiesta de los Lagos'', which is held on the last weekend of September. Two colorful parades known as ''El Pregón'' and ''Virgen del Carmen'' are held on 16 July every year.

Other town attractions are the many restaurants specializing in local [[cuisine]], along with the clubs, discos and a [[paragliding]] club.{{fact|date=July 2022}}

[[Andrea Scacco]] was elected to be the new mayor of Ibarra in 2019 planning to reduce xenophobia and to create a women's refuge in the city.<ref name=newmayor>{{Cite web |date=2019-04-01 |title=Andrea Scacco, alcaldesa electa de Ibarra |url=http://www.teleamazonas.com/2019/03/andrea-scacco-alcaldesa-electa-de-ibarra/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401205203/http://www.teleamazonas.com/2019/03/andrea-scacco-alcaldesa-electa-de-ibarra/ |archive-date=2019-04-01  |access-date=2022-07-04 }}</ref>

==Climate==

Ibarra features a [[Mediterranean climate#Warm-summer Mediterranean climate|warm-summer mediterranean climate]] (''Csb'') under the [[Köppen climate classification]]. This is possible due to the town's high elevation (7,300&nbsp;ft) in the [[Andes#Ecuador|Ecuadorian Andes]] providing cooler temperatures and a seasonal rain-shadow characteristic.  The dry/warm season is technically local winter due to the town's location being south of the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] from June to September. However, since Ibarra is located just north of the equator, this season could be already be classified as summer. The [[Mediterranean climate#K.C3.B6ppen climate classification|highland climate]] is mild all year round.
