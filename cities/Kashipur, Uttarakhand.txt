'''Kashipur''' ([[Kumaoni language|Kumaoni]]: ''Kāshīpur'' {{IPA-hns|kaːʃiːpʊr|}}) is a city of [[Udham Singh Nagar district]] in the Indian state of [[Uttarakhand]], and one of its seven subdivisions. Located in the western part of [[Udham Singh Nagar district]], it is [[Kumaon division|Kumaun]]'s third most populous city and the [[List of cities in Uttarakhand by population|sixth most populous in Uttarakhand]]. According to the [[2011 Census of India]], the population is 121,623 for the city of Kashipur and 283,136 for Kashipur Tehsil. Kashipur also has [[IIM Kashipur]], one of the thirteen Indian Institutes of Managements the government has set up during the Eleventh Five-year Plan.

Historically part of [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaun]], Kashipur is named after ''Kashinath Adhikari'', the founder of the township and governor of the ''[[pargana]]'', one of the officers of the [[Chand Kings]] of [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaun]] in the 16th and 17th centuries.<ref>[https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V15_077.gif Kashipur town] ''[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]]'', 1909, v. 15, p. 71.</ref> Kashipur remained under the rule of Chand Kings until the latter half of eighteenth century until ''Nand Ram'', the then governor of Kashipur, became practically independent.

Kashipur was ceded to British in 1801, after which, it played a major role in the conquest of [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]] during the [[Anglo-Gorkha war]] in 1815.<ref>{{cite web|title=Imperial Gazetteer of India, Volume 18, page 324|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V18_330.gif|website=dsal.uchicago.edu|publisher=Digital South Asia Library|access-date=19 July 2017}}</ref> After Kumaun was ceded to the British under the [[Treaty of Sugauli]], Kashipur became the headquarters of Terai district in the [[Kumaon division]].

[[File:Ruins of Temple.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of the ancient city of Govisana]]
Kashipur was known as ''Govishana'', during the time of [[Harsha]] (606–647&nbsp;AD). The ruins of the large settlement of those days can be still seen near the city.<ref>{{cite book|author=Omacanda Hāṇḍā|title=History of Uttaranchal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7_Ct9gzvkDQC&pg=PA75|year=2002|publisher=Indus Publishing|isbn=978-81-7387-134-4|page=75}}</ref> The famous Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] also travelled the city in the 7th century.<ref name="asiatic">{{cite book|title=Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal|publisher=Asiatic Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3lgxAQAAMAAJ|language=en|year=1866}}</ref>{{rp|174}} He described it as "The Capital was 15 li in circuit.

The modern town of Kashipur was founded by Kashinath Adhikari, the governor of Tarai under [[Chand kings#List of Chand Kings|King Devi Chand]] of [[Champawat]]. Later Raja Mohan Chand; one of the Kings of Kumaon's younger brother Lal Singh was given the estate Kashipur and Raja Guman Singh became its first King. Kashipur's last king, Raja Hari Chand Raj Singh again got back the titular throne of Kumaon in British India, as Raja Anand Singh (Raja of Almora) had no issue. The exact date of the foundation of the town is disputed, several historians having expressed their own views on the matter. [[Reginald Heber|Bishop Heber]], in his book ''Travels in India'' wrote that Kashipur was founded by a deity named Kashi 5000 years back (approx 3176&nbsp;BC).<ref name="asiatic" />{{rp|175}}<ref name = "heber" /> [[Alexander Cunningham|Sir Alexander Cunningham]] invalidated his views in his book, ''The Ancient Geography of India'', in which he wrote "the good bishop was grossly deceived by his informant, as it is well known that the town is a modern one, it having been built about AD 1718 by ''kashi-nath'', a follower of [[Chand kings#List of Chand Kings|Raja Devi-Chandra]] of [[Champawat]] in [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]]".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cunningham|first1=Sir Alexander|title=The Ancient Geography of India: I.

When the British arrived in Kumaun at the end of the 18th century AD, Kashipur was ruled by King ''Shib Lal'', the second King of Kashipur. Kashipur was ceded to the British by Shib Lal in 1801 after which it became a revenue division.

To the north of the city lies the [[Bhabar]] tract of [[Ramnagar, Nainital|Ramnagar]], which separates the area from [[Shivalik Hills]]. Kashipur is drained only by minor rivers and lakes, primarily by Dhela river, a tributary of River [[Ramganga]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Steps to Conserve the Water Quality of River Ganga (Upto Kanpur)|date=31 August 2016|publisher=UP Pollution Control Board|location=Lucknow|page=14|url=http://uppcb.com/pdf/ngt_290916.pdf|access-date=6 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Water Quality of Rivers at Interstate Borders|publisher=[[Central Pollution Control Board]], Ministry of Environment, Forests & Climate Change, [[Govt. of India]]|location=Delhi|page=29|url=http://cpcb.nic.in/upload/NewItems/NewItem_211_IRBM_Report.pdf|access-date=6 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025233015/http://cpcb.nic.in/upload/NewItems/NewItem_211_IRBM_Report.pdf|archive-date=25 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Several rivers and stream cross the region transversely and leave their deposit making the land fertile.

===Geology===
Geologically, Kashipur is dominated by the [[Terai]] tract, which runs horizontally through the city from [[Jaspur]] in the west, passing through the city center, to [[Bajpur]] and [[Rudrapur, Uttarakhand|Rudrapur]] in the east. Terai formation consists of [[clays]], sandy clays,
fine to medium [[sand]] and occasional [[gravels]].<ref name="bussa">{{cite book|last1=Bussa|first1=Ravikalyan|title=District Udham Singh Nagar at a Glance|publisher=Central Ground Water Board, Uttaranchal Region|location=Dehradun|url=http://cgwb.gov.in/District_Profile/Uttarakhand/UdhamSinghNagar.pdf|access-date=6 June 2017}}</ref>{{rp|14}} In this formation there is a dominance of clayey successions over sandy horizons.<ref name="bussa" />{{rp|14}} There are damp and marshy tracts in places. It is the zone of seepage where fine sand, silt and clay are deposited by the emerging streams. Almost level and fertile soil along with high water table has rendered the belt useful. According to the [[Bureau of Indian Standards]], the town falls under [[Earthquake hazard zoning of India|seismic zone 4]], in a scale of 2 to 5 (in order of increasing vulnerability to earthquakes).<ref>{{cite book|title=Hazard profiles of Indian districts|publisher=National Capacity Building Project in Disaster Management, UNDP|url=http://www.undp.org.in/dmweb/hazardprofile.pdf|access-date=17 October 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519100611/http://www.undp.org.in/dmweb/hazardprofile.pdf|archive-date=19 May 2006}}</ref><ref name="sdmap">{{cite web|title=Complete sdmap, Uttarakhand|url=http://dmmc.uk.gov.in/files/pdf/complete_sdmap.pdf|access-date=26 October 2016}}</ref>{{rp|27}}

===Climate===
[[File:Daily life of Kashipur with patterned clouds.jpg|thumb|Clouds hovering over the city]]
Kashipur has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cwa''),<ref name="climate" /> like much of the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]]s to its south, with average maximum temperatures in summer (June) being around {{convert|31.6|°C|°F}}; and in winter (January) around {{convert|14.5|°C|°F}}.<ref name="climate" /> The driest month is November, with 5&nbsp;mm of rain. With an average of 374&nbsp;mm, the most precipitation falls in July.<ref name="climate" /> There is a difference of 369&nbsp;mm of precipitation between the driest and wettest months.<ref name="climate" /> During the year, the average temperatures vary by 17.1&nbsp;°C. The main seasons are summer from March to June, the [[monsoon]] season from July to November and winter from December to February.<ref name="sdmap" />{{rp|13}}

The climate of Kashipur is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year. In summer, Kashipur is largely under the influence of moist, maritime airflow from the western side of the subtropical anticyclonic cells over [[Indian Ocean|low-latitude ocean waters]]. Temperatures are high and can lead to warm, oppressive nights.<ref name="sdmap" />{{rp|13}} Summers are usually somewhat wetter than winters, with much of the rainfall coming from convectional thunderstorm activity; [[tropical cyclones]] also enhance warm-season rainfall in some regions.<ref name="sdmap" />{{rp|13}} The coldest month is usually quite mild, although frosts are not uncommon, and winter precipitation is derived primarily from frontal cyclones along the polar front.
But in the recent years kashipur has witnessed a drastic change in weather and its climatic conditions due to increase in construction in the nearby regions also due to overpopulation and increase in demand by people for the region's resources. due to this we have seen that the trees are cut due to which average temperature is increasing. also the most popular lake in the girital region has alao dried up.

==Economy==
Agriculture is the main economic activity in the region. Fertile land, coupled with water availability, makes the region an intensively cropped area. Apart from Rice and Wheat, major produces are sugarcane, mango, guava, jamun, jack fruit and litchi. Large number of farmers in this region are actually settlers from outside, having land holdings in excess of five acres. government has allotted agricultural plots to refugees around Garhi Negi village and to the hill people at [[Maldhan Chaur|Maldhan]] village.

Historically, Industrial activities in the region were very small scale and agriculture based. Later, with administrative encouragement and support, rapid industrial development took place around Kashipur town. About 603 industrial units were functioning in the town, as reported by the Kashipur 2011 Master Plan. These included 163 Cottage industries, 415 small scale industries, and 25 medium (or large) Industries. Industrial development coupled with rich agricultural cash crops practices made this area more prosperous, relative to other parts of Kumaon region.

The region accounts for almost 50% of the medium and large scale industries in the district. Major Industrial units, mostly located on Kashipur-Thakurdwara road, include Surya Roshini Limited (Bulbs and Tubes), India Glycols limited, Kashi Vishwanath Steels limited, Jindal Solvents extraction limited, DSM Sugar mills limited, Naini Papers limited, SRF limited and Shriram extraction private limited etc. Large industrial houses such as [http://www.flexituff.com/ Flexituff Ventures International Limited], IGL, [[HCL Technologies]], [[Videocon]], Pasupati Arcylon Limited etc. also have branch establishments in the city.
