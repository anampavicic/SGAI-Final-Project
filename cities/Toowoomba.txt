The surrounding Darling Downs region is known for its rolling hills and pastures, agricultural produce, and historic homesteads.

==Etymology==
The exact origin of the city's current name is unknown, although it is widely accepted that the name derives from an Aboriginal language.<ref name="naming">{{Cite web |date=November 30, 2021 |title=Historic Toowoomba Region locations |url=https://www.tr.qld.gov.au/our-region/history/historic-locations/117-historic-toowoomba-region-locations# |access-date=October 8, 2023 |website=Toowoomba Region}}</ref>

When Toowoomba was first discovered by Europeans, it was named "Drayton Swamp" (in reference to the Toowoomba Swamp) and was often nicknamed "The Swamp". One theory is that after European settlement, the local Aboriginal people referred to it as "Tawampa", which is borrowed from "The Swamp".<ref name="naming"/>

Another theory is that it derives from the name "Toogoom". This theory was first proposed by author [[Steele Rudd]] in a letter to the [[Toowoomba City Council]]. He claimed that his father told him that in 1848, he first saw Toowoomba and that he assisted in laying it out the following year. He believed that it derived from the native name "Toogoom" because of the reeds that grew in the area. Rudd also wrote that he remembered that the original Aboriginal name for "The Swamp" was ''Chinkery Yackan'' meaning "water like the stars".<ref name="naming"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17049613 |title=Letters |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |issue=30,043 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=18 April 1934 |accessdate=1 September 2023 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

Another theory was proposed by the wife of pioneer Toowoomba resident Thomas Alford. She claimed to have asked the Aboriginals what they called the area; they replied with "Woomba Woomba", meaning "the springs and the water underneath". However, she claimed that the Alfords thought this would not be a suitable name for their house and store, so they added the prefix "too-" and omitted one "Woomba" (as this would be a synonym of "two Woomba"), hence "Toowoomba".<ref name="naming"/>

In 1875, [[William Henry Groom]] wrote an account of Toowoomba. He stated that "Toowoomba" derived from the Aboriginal term "great in the future". However, he did not provide a source for his information.<ref name="naming"/>

Another theory was proposed by [[botanist]] [[Archibald Meston]] in a book titled ''A Geographical History of Queensland''. He wrote:<ref name="naming"/>

{{blockquote|"Toowoom" or "Choowom" was the local blacks' name for a small native melon (''[[Cucumis pubescens]]'') which grew plentifully on the site of the township. The terminal "ba" is equal to the adverb "There", so the whole word means "melons there", and to an Aborigine it meant "the place where the melon grows".}}

While this melon still exists and can be found in areas along the [[Balonne River|Balonne]] and [[Warrego River]]s, as well as in areas closer to Toowoomba, there is no evidence that the melon grew near the Toowoomba swamps.

A man named Enoggera Charlie proposed another theory in a news story he wrote for the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''. He claimed that when he was looking for work as a tar boy, he camped overnight near the Toowoomba Swamp. He claimed that when he asked a [[shepherd]] about the naming of the Toowoomba Swamp, he was told that near the junction of the East and West Swamps, there was a log with an inscription informing [[swagman|swagmen]] of the way to a well-known [[homestead (buildings)|homestead]] where [[field ration|food rations]] were available. He claimed that the inscription read "To Woombrah".<ref name="naming"/>

A man named Ardlaw Lawrence put forward his theory shortly after Enoggera Charlie. He suggested that the name was an [[Anglicisation|Anglicised]] form of "Boowoomga", which comes from the term for "thunder" in the dialect spoken by the Aboriginal tribe inhabiting areas along the [[Burnett River|Upper Burnett River]] (including the town of [[Gayndah]]). However, it is highly unlikely that this theory is correct, as this dialect was not spoken in the [[Darling Downs]] region (but rather in the [[Wide Bay-Burnett]] region) and Lawrence did not state why he transferred the name to the Darling Downs.<ref name="naming"/> In fact, the distance between Toowoomba and Gayndah is just over 218 kilometres [[as the crow flies]].

In 1899, [[George Essex Evans]] published his theory in a pamphlet. He wrote that "Toowoomba" was an Aboriginal word meaning "meeting of the waters", although no evidence was provided to support this claim.<ref name="naming"/>

The city is situated on the edge of the range and the low ridges behind it. Two valleys extend north from the southern boundary, originating from springs on either side of Middle Ridge near Spring Street, at an altitude of approximately {{convert|680|m|ft}}. These waterways, East Creek and West Creek, converge just north of the CBD to form Gowrie Creek.<ref name=":4" />

Gowrie Creek drains west across the [[Darling Downs]] and is a tributary of the [[Condamine River]], part of the [[Murray–Darling basin]]. The water flowing down Gowrie Creek travels approximately {{convert|3000|km|abbr=on}} to the mouth of the [[Murray River]] near [[Adelaide]], South Australia.<ref name=":4" /> Rain falling on the easternmost streets of Toowoomba flows east to [[Moreton Bay]], a distance of around {{convert|170|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

The rich [[volcanic soil]] in the region helps maintain the 159 public parks that are scattered across the city. [[Jacaranda]], [[Cinnamomum camphora|camphor laurel]] and [[Platanus|plane]] trees line many of the city streets. The city's reputation as 'The Garden City' is highlighted during the Australian Carnival of Flowers festival held in September each year. [[Deciduous]] trees from around the world line many of the parks, giving a display of autumn colour.<ref name="tat">{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200205/s549344.htm|title=Toowoomba autumn tourism turns new leaf|date=7 May 2002|work=[[ABC News Online]]|access-date=24 September 2010|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}{{Dead link|date=January 2019|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>[[File:NEToowoomba.JPG|thumb|A panorama of Toowoomba looking south-west from Mount Lofty|center|900x900px]]

==History==
{{Main|History of Toowoomba, Queensland}}

=== Traditional owners of the land ===
[[Giabal]] and [[Jarowair]] are recognised as the two main Aboriginal language groups of the Toowoomba  with Giabal extending south of the city while Jarowair extends north of the city.<ref name=":0"/> The Jarowair (also known as Yarowair, Yarow-wair, Barrunggam, Yarrowair, Yarowwair and Yarrow-weir) language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Toowoomba Regional Council, particularly Toowoomba north to [[Crows Nest, Queensland|Crows Nest]] and west to [[Oakey, Queensland|Oakey]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://maps.slq.qld.gov.au/iyil/view/jarowair-21|title=Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages map|date=2020|website=State Library of Queensland|access-date=23 January 2020|archive-date=25 December 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201225221720/https://maps.slq.qld.gov.au/iyil/view/jarowair-21|url-status=live}}</ref>

This traditional landscape changed dramatically from 1840 with the incursion of British pastoralists into the region. Those [[Aboriginal Australians]] that survived the frontier conflict of this time were pushed to the fringe of society in camps and later moved to missions such as [[Deebing Creek Mission|Deebing Creek]], [[Durundur Mission|Durundur]] and later Barambah (now [[Cherbourg, Queensland|Cherbourg]]). Some local Aboriginal Australians worked on the properties around Toowoomba in this contact period. Ceremonies such as the [[Bonye Bonye festival]] remained active until the late 19th century – groups from south east and south west Queensland as well as northern [[New South Wales]] gathered at Gummingurru, near [[Gowrie Mountain, Queensland|Gowrie]] (west of Toowoomba) prior to attending the festival. The Gummingurru site with its [[Aboriginal stone arrangement|ancient stone circles]] is being restored by the Gummingurru Aboriginal Corporation and is an important ceremonial place for not only the traditional groups but neighbouring groups.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=Gummingurru Aboriginal historical site |url=https://www.tr.qld.gov.au/facilities-recreation/theatres-galleries/museums-historical-villages-memorials/5732-gummingurru-aboriginal-historical-site |access-date=2024-07-29 |website=Toowoomba Region |language=en-gb}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Gummingurru : Site History |url=https://www.gummingurru.com.au/Site+History |access-date=2024-07-29 |website=www.gummingurru.com.au}}</ref>

=== British exploration ===
Toowoomba's colonial history traces back to when English [[botanist]] and explorer [[Allan Cunningham (botanist)|Allan Cunningham]] arrived in Australia from [[Brazil]]. He conducted an inland expedition north from the [[New England (New South Wales)|New England]] region and in June 1827 encountered {{convert|4|e6acre|km2}} of rich farming and grazing land, which he named as the [[Darling Downs]],<ref name="dab">{{cite web |url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks15/1500721h/0-dict-biogCl-Cu.html#cunningham1 |title=Dictionary of Australian Biography Cl-Cu |work=Dictionary of Australian Biography |publisher=Project Gutenberg Australia |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726155626/http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks15/1500721h/0-dict-biogCl-Cu.html#cunningham1 |archive-date=26 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> bordered on the east by the [[Great Dividing Range]] and {{convert|160|km|-1}} west of the settlement of [[Moreton Bay]].

=== British colonisation ===
In 1840, [[Patrick Leslie]] (second son of the ninth [[Clan Leslie|Laird of Warthill]]) and Peter Murphy established Toolburra Station {{convert|56|mi}} south-west of Toowoomba, being the first British pastoralists to take land on the Downs. Later that same year, [[Eton College]] graduate, [[Arthur Hodgson]], together with Gilbert Elliot and Cocky Rogers established "Eton Vale" on land which included "The Swamp", now known as Toowoomba.<ref name="hector">{{cite book |last1=Holthouse |first1=Hector |title=Up Rode the Squatters |date=1970 |publisher=Angus & Robertson |location=North Ryde |isbn=0207151563}}</ref>

In forming [[Eton Vale Homestead Ruins|Eton Vale]], Hodgson's brother [[Christopher Pemberton Hodgson]], later described the "constant skirmishes with the natives" to wrest control of the area off the local Aboriginal people. He wrote that hundreds of Aborigines were killed in a bitter war that lasted three years from the time they arrived in the area. The interior of Eton Vale homestead was decorated with spears and boomerangs and other spoil which the Hodgsons had collected after hard fought battles with "the blacks". Hodgson wrote "who would not rather put a ball in their hearts to rid themselves of their ceremonials and presence at once?"<ref name="Pemberton">{{cite book|last1=Hodgson|first1=Christopher Pemberton|title=Reminiscences of Australia with Hints on the Squatter's Life|date=1846|publisher=W.N. Wright|location=Pall Mall|url=https://archive.org/details/reminiscencesau00hodggoog|accessdate=1 September 2023}}</ref>

The general mode of attack by the colonists would involve an early morning raid on the Aboriginal camps. The Hodgsons would "generally employ our [black] boys from distant tribes to act as trackers" to locate defiant groups of Aboriginal people. Sometimes a prisoner was taken and "ordered to conduct us to his own camp on risk of his life" and once at this camp, "we rushed to attack it and we had, notwithstanding, ample revenge". Hodgson describes how Aborigines would try to recover "the corpses of those who had fallen victims to the white man's gun in defiance of a sentry on the lookout". Those who were at peace with the Hodgson brothers, were kept in line with methods such as the taking of young boys from the tribe as hostages. Hodgson claimed that if the local Aboriginal people were to be considered a species of ''simia acaudata'' or tail-less monkey, they had to be "hunted down and exterminated".<ref name="Pemberton" />

=== Town of Toowoomba ===
[[File:Royal Bull's Head Inn, Drayton, 2015.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Bull's Head Inn]], the building that contributed to Toowoomba's early development]]
Towards the end of the 1840s, closer settlement was occurring and the nearby township of [[Drayton, Queensland|Drayton]] had grown to the point where it had its own newspaper, general store, trading post and the [[Royal Bull's Head Inn]], which was built by William Horton and still stands today. The first Britishers began to live at "The Swamp" (Toowoomba) from 1849, where Josiah Dent, William Shuttleworth and William Gurney were employed to cut reeds and timber for use at Drayton.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article253859093 |title=Early Toowoomba. |newspaper=[[Toowoomba Chronicle and Darling Downs Gazette]] |volume=LXV |issue=68 |location=Queensland, Australia |date=20 March 1926 |accessdate=1 September 2023 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Dent was said to have "lived in a tent, and with his axe, he killed the blacks".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article182898767 |title=Fifty Years Ago. |newspaper=[[Darling Downs Gazette]] |volume=LII |issue=8856 |location=Queensland, Australia |date=20 November 1909 |accessdate=1 September 2023 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

By 1858 Toowoomba was growing fast. It had a population of 700, three hotels and many stores. Land selling at {{convert|4|$/acre|$/ha|$=£|abbr=off|0}} in 1850 was by then {{convert|150|$/acre|$/ha|$=£|abbr=off}}. Governor Bowen granted the wish of locals and a new municipality was proclaimed on 24 November 1860.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The first town council election took place on 4 January 1861 and [[William Henry Groom]] won.

The former Toowoomba Mayor [[Di Thorley]] proposed a controversial potable reuse project under the Toowoomba Water Futures plan which would result in water reclaimed from the Wetalla Sewage Treatment Plant being returned to Cooby Dam to provide 25% of the potable water supply for Toowoomba. Other water supply options include importing water from Oakey Creek Groundwater Management Area (average TDS 1660&nbsp;mg/L), importing water from Condamine Groundwater Management Area (average TDS 740&nbsp;mg/L), and water from coal seam gas production (TDS 1200–4300&nbsp;mg/L).<ref>[http://www.valscan.com.au/TCC-WaterFuturesLORES.pdf Water Future] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304082819/http://www.valscan.com.au/TCC-WaterFuturesLORES.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }}.

On 29 July 2006, Toowoomba City Council conducted a poll of Toowoomba residents on the proposal to use this multi-barrier filtration system for filtering sewage for drinking purposes. The poll question was: "Do you support the addition of purified recycled water to Toowoomba's water supply via Cooby Dam as proposed by Water Futures – Toowoomba?" 38% of voters supported the proposal and 62% opposed. This meant that despite dams reaching critical levels, the city [[Toowoomba Water Futures referendum, 2006|rejected the use of recycled water in a plebiscite]]. Since the public rejection in 2006 of adding recycled sewage to the drinking water supply, water conservation measures have included harvesting stormwater for use in public parks and adding filtered groundwater to the town water supply. The city was under level 5 water restrictions as of 26 September 2006. This prohibits residents from using town water on their lawns, gardens or cars, and residents are strongly urged to cut down on water consumption.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/toowoomba-says-no-to-recycled-water/2006/07/29/1153816419568.html |title=Toowoomba says no to recycled water - National |newspaper=smh.com.au |access-date=4 June 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205235433/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/toowoomba-says-no-to-recycled-water/2006/07/29/1153816419568.html |archive-date=5 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thechronicle.com.au/news/toowoomba-recycled-water-poll-five-years-later/1066451/ |title=Recycled water poll: five years on &#124; Toowoomba Chronicle |publisher=Thechronicle.com.au |date=13 August 2011 |access-date=4 June 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606235658/http://www.thechronicle.com.au/news/toowoomba-recycled-water-poll-five-years-later/1066451/ |archive-date=6 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In 2007, the Toowoomba City Council commenced a bore drilling program to augment the dwindling dam supplies and constructed several subartesian bores across the city and one artesian bore at Wetalla in the city's north. Many of the subartesian bores provided potable water with a reliable yield and have been developed into production however the artesian bore's water quality was very poor, prohibiting development as a potable source. This was an expensive setback for the city as the cost was over A$2&nbsp;million for drilling to over {{cvt|700|m}}. In January 2008, yield testing had been stalled due to the unavailability of appropriate pumping equipment. The Toowoomba Regional Council began supplementing the city's water supply with bore water from the Great Artesian Basin in September 2009.<ref name="ttbw">{{Cite news |url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/toowoomba-taps-into-bore-water-as-drought-continues/story-e6freoof-1225776994185 |title=Toowoomba taps into bore water as drought continues |first=Mitch |last=Gaynor |access-date=23 September 2010 |date=20 September 2009 |work=[[The Sunday Mail (Brisbane)|The Sunday Mail]] |publisher=Queensland Newspapers |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609122513/http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/toowoomba-taps-into-bore-water-as-drought-continues/story-e6freoof-1225776994185 |archive-date=9 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Groundwater]] has become a significant contributor to the city's water supply needs and now constitutes one third of the total volume of water treated for reticulated supply ({{convert|160|Ml|cuft}} per week).<ref>{{cite web |title=Weekly Water Consumption Figures |date=10 March 2008 |url=http://www.toowoomba.qld.gov.au/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_details&gid=1128&Itemid=107 |publisher=Toowoomba City Council |access-date=12 March 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208084738/http://www.toowoomba.qld.gov.au/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_details&gid=1128&Itemid=107 |archive-date=8 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
