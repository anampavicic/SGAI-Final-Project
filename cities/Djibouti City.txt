'''Djibouti''' (also called '''Djibouti City''' and '''Jibuti''' in early Western texts){{efn|{{bulleted list|{{langx|ar|مدينة جيبوتي}}|{{langx|fr|Ville de Djibouti}}|{{langx|so|Magaalada Jabuuti}}|{{langx|aa|Gabuutî Magaala}}}}}} is the capital of [[Djibouti]]. It is located in the coastal Djibouti Region on the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]].

Djibouti has a population of around 780,000 inhabitants,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Djibouti: Regions, Major Cities & Towns - Population Statistics, Maps, Charts, Weather and Web Information |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/djibouti/ |access-date=2024-09-08 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref><ref name=CIA/> which counts for 73% of the country's population. The settlement was founded in 1888 by the French, on land leased from the ruling Somali and Afar Sultans. During the ensuing period, it served as the capital of [[French Somaliland]] and its successor the [[French Territory of the Afars and Issas]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Djibouti (city)|History of Djibouti}}
There is evidence of human settlement on the eastern coastline of [[Djibouti]] dating back to the [[Bronze Age]].

[[File:Djibouti City in 1895.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Djibouti City in 1895]]
From 1862 until 1894, the land to the north of the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]] was called ''[[Obock]]'' and was ruled by [[Issa clan|Issa]] and [[Afar people|Afar]] [[Sultan]]s, local authorities with whom France signed various treaties between 1883 and 1887 to first gain a foothold in the region.<ref name="Uwechue">Raph Uwechue, ''Africa year book and who's who'', (Africa Journal Ltd.: 1977), p. 209</ref><ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Somaliland#History of French Somaliland |display=Somaliland: History of French Somaliland |volume=25 |page=383}}</ref><ref name="Apcoatf">''A Political Chronology of Africa'', (Taylor & Francis), p. 132</ref> The exchange of Franco-British diplomatic notes of 2 and 9 February 1888 fixed the territorial limit between the colonies of the two countries; leaving explicitly under [[French colonial empire|French]] authority the southern coasts of the Gulf of Tadjoura, including a [[peninsula]] composed of insubmersible plateaux, Ras Djibouti as a highly strategic location, a future bridgehead for French designs in the rest of Africa and Asia. It is then that this point begins to be used as departure for caravans towards [[Harar]].

[[File:Photo of Djibouti in 1902.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Djibouti in 1902]]
The French subsequently founded Djibouti in 1888, in a previously [[uninhabited]] stretch of coast.  According to one account, this was due to "its superiority to [[Obock|Obok]] both in respect to harbour accommodation and in nearness to [[Harrar]]."<ref>"Jibuti" (unsigned article), ''Encyclopædia Britannica,'' 11th ed. (1911), vol. 15, p. 414.</ref> [[Ambouli]] was a small village before the French arrived it was about {{convert|3 |km}} south of Ras Djiboutil, Ambouli is identifies the city with Canbala by [[O.G.S. Crawford]]. Canbala appears in [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]]'s map of 1192 on the coast of the [[Horn of Africa]], southeast of the straits of [[Bab-el-Mandeb]], and with Cambaleh, a town where the Venetian traveler Bragadino, a thirteenth-century European visitor to [[Ethiopia]], resided for eight years.<ref>O.G.S. Crawford, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1789985 "Some Medieval Theories about the Nile", ''Geographical Journal''], '''114''' (1949), p. 8</ref> In 1896, the settlement was made the capital of [[French Somaliland]].<ref name="Wbi">World Book, Inc, ''The [[World Book Encyclopedia]]'', Volume 1, (World Book: 2007)</ref>
The main purpose of the French interest in colonizing the region was to protect their trade routes to [[French Madagascar|Madagascar]] and [[French Indochina|Indochina]] from the encroachment of other European powers. The town later grew considerably in size following the construction of the [[Ethio-Djibouti Railways|Franco-Ethiopian Railway]]. In 1895, Djibouti, which, not so long ago, was just a [[peninsula]], already had 5,000 [[inhabitant]]s. Many Issa and Afar [[nomad]]s left their herds to settle here, built houses on what is now the downtown area. They became [[Stevedore|docker]]s and constitute the first local proletariat. The French and natives built hotels, houses, mosques and churches. The Yemeni, Egyptian, [[Greeks|Greek]], [[Armenians|Armenian]] and Italian merchants and traders flock to this promise that Djibouti represents. Additionally, the rich agricultural southern area of [[Ambouli]] continued to flourish due to an abundance of [[date palm]] farms and [[Orchard]]s. Djibouti did not attract as many boats as [[Aden]]. In 1896, [[Léonce Lagarde]] became the first governor of the French Somali Coast, a new name for the French dependencies in the region. At the start of the 20th century, Djibouti had 10,000 inhabitants and was considered a major regional port. Its main activity remains the supply of French ships en route to [[Indochina]] or [[Madagascar]]. Only 150,000 tonnes of [[freight]] per year are handled. In addition, the railway line has not yet been fully exploited.

Although the initial French efforts to establish commercial influence in the region proved to be unsuccessful enough to require a [[Government of France|government]] bailout,<ref name=EBA>"{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Abyssinia#Provinces and Towns |display=Abyssinia: (7) Provinces and Towns |volume=1 |page=86}}</ref> the [[Ethio-Djibouti Railways|Franco-Ethiopian Railway]] itself was a success and allowed Djibouti's commerce to quickly eclipse the former caravan-based trade carried on with nearby [[Zeila]] in [[British Somaliland]].<ref name=EBZ>"{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Zaila |volume=28 |page=950}}</ref> Djibouti became the center of exports from southern Ethiopia and the [[Ogaden]], including trade in [[Harari coffee]] and [[khat]].<ref name=EBJ>"{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Jibuti |volume=15 |page=414}}" (i.e., Djibouti)</ref> Djibouti began to develop as a commercial center. In 1933, Djibouti was the first town to be wired to electricity in [[French Somaliland]]. On 12 July 1926, the Fontainebleau, a Messageries Maritimes steamer loaded with cotton and heading for China caught fire while approaching Djibouti. The captain decided to flood the holds and run aground his ship in the middle of the harbor of Djibouti, causing significant inconvenience for port traffic. The city then proposed using the wreck as a promontory of a new [[deep water port|deep-water port]], connecting it to the Marabout plateau by a 700-meter jetty. The idea was accepted and work began in 1931. The first phase was completed in 1935 and considerably increased port and [[Railway|rail]] traffic. An [[oil terminal]] was built in 1937.

[[File:OlderDjibouticity.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The [[Al Sada Mosque]] in the 1940s]]
During the [[Second World War]], Djibouti was hit by [[Fascist Italy (1922–1943)|Italian]] airstrikes on 21 June 1940, which killed many people in the town. The [[anti-aircraft]] fire was intense and two [[Italian Air Force|Italian aircraft]] failed to return, but fires and explosions were seen in Djibouti. Overnight, several waves of [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.81]] bombers attacked the port facilities. After the France fell and the colony was then ruled by the [[Vichy France|pro-Axis Vichy (French) government]].{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75–76}} By that time, the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] offensive against the Italians included a [[blockade]] of [[French Somaliland]]. On 25 September the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] launched several airstrikes on the city, prompting French official [[Pierre Nouailhetas|Nouailhetas]] to institute a brutal reign of terror against Europeans and African inhabitants of the city. [[Famine]] set in malnutrition-related diseases took many lives, 70% of them women and children and many townsfolk left for the [[hinterland]]. The locals named the blockade the carmii, a word for a type of sorghum usually reserved for cattle, but used as human food at the height of the famine. The head doctor at the hospital committed suicide in despair. Only a few Arab dhows (boutres) managed to run the blockade to Djibouti and [[Obock]] and only two French ships from [[Madagascar]] managed to run it.

The [[Japanese declaration of war on the United States and the British Empire|Japanese declaration of war]] (7 December 1941) gave the colony some respite, since the [[Royal Navy]] were forced to withdraw all but two ships from the [[blockade]] for use in the Far East. The rule of Nouailhetas was too brutal for even the authoritarian leaders at [[Vichy France|Vichy]] to stand for.{{sfn|Rovighi|1995|p=109}} In October 1942 he was recalled and forced to retire without a pension, Following the war, he escaped to [[Portugal]]. He returned to face a military [[tribunal]] and was acquitted on 17 July 1953, which sparked outrage in [[Djibouti]]. The [[East Africa Command|Commander-in-Chief, East Africa]], [[William Platt]], codenamed the negotiations for the surrender of French Somaliland "Pentagon", because there were five sides: himself, the Vichy governor, the [[Free French]], the British minister at Addis Ababa and the United States. [[Christian Raimond Dupont]] surrendered and Colonel Raynal's troops crossed back into [[French Somaliland]] on 26 December 1942, completing its liberation. The official handover took place at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. on 28 December.{{sfn|Ebsworth|1953|p=568}} The first governor appointed under the [[Free French]] was [[André Bayardelle]].

In 1946, [[Djibouti]] received the status of [[overseas territory]]. An elected territorial [[National Assembly|assembly]] was created then, in 1956, a government council charged, under the chairmanship of the head of the [[territory]], with the management of local affairs. At the same time, fiscal, customs and monetary measures are put in place to promote the development of the deep-water port, to finally compete with [[Aden]]. Port facilities are expanding considerably and can afford to accommodate 2,000 ships per year. Djibouti becomes a [[free port]] and abandons the [[Free Zone (region)|free zone]]. In 1948, a new currency, the Côte Française des Somalis, was created, pegged to the [[gold standard]] and convertible into dollars.

[[File:A-demonstration-in-Djibouti-Africa-1967-352022097779.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Post-referendum demonstrations on 23 March 1967]]
In August 1966, an official visit to the territory by then [[French President]], General [[Charles de Gaulle]], was also met with [[Demonstration (political)|demonstration]]s and rioting.<ref name="Apcoatf" /><ref name="Nwvol">''Newsweek'', Volume 81, (Newsweek: 1973), p.254.</ref> In response to the protests, de Gaulle ordered another referendum.<ref name="Nwvol"/> On 19 March 1967, a [[French Somaliland independence referendum, 1967|second plebiscite]] was held to determine the fate of the territory. Initial results supported a continued but looser relationship with France. However, the referendum was again marred by reports of vote rigging on the part of the French authorities, voters rejected independence by a 50-point margin. Announcement of the plebiscite results sparked civil unrest, including several deaths.<ref name="Nwjestr">[[Jean Strouse]], ''Newsweek'', Volume 69, Issues 10–17, (Newsweek: 1967), p.48.</ref><ref name="Tioipeami">Alvin J.

The population of Djibouti was growing rapidly, from officially about 17,000 inhabitants in 1947. In 1949, the plan of Djibouti consisted of four main features: a hierarchical system of streets laid out in a grid, large blocks consisting of small-scale domestic dwellings, the organization of these blocks around central open spaces, and the concentration of cultural institutions to form a civic center. It then became the headquarters of the succeeding [[French Territory of the Afars and Issas]].

When [[Djibouti]] declared [[Independence Day (Djibouti)|Independence]] on 27 June 1977, the population of Djibouti was over 110,000, the city has served as the administrative and commercial capital of the Republic of Djibouti.<ref>Nohlen, D, Krennerich, M & Thibaut, B (1999) ''Elections in Africa: A data handbook'', p. 322 {{ISBN|0-19-829645-2}}</ref>

==Climate==
Djibouti has an [[arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''[[hot desert climate|BWh]]''). It is characterised by very hot rainless summers and a very warm, slightly wetter winter season. Most of the annual precipitation falls between October and May. The city sees on average {{convert|163.5|mm|in|2}} of rainfall per year. Average high temperatures range from {{convert|29|C|F}} during the months of December, January and February, to about {{convert|42|C|F}} in July. There are two seasons: a hot dry season from May to October and a cooler season with more precipitation from November to April (winter). The rainfall on the coast usually occurs between November and March, whereas further inland it falls between April and October. In the summer months, temperatures routinely exceed {{convert|40|C|F}}, with relative humidity at its lowest point of the year. Sunshine is abundant in the city, averaging eight to ten hours a day year-round. It is lowest during the rainy period, when there is some coastal [[fog]] and greater cloud coverage as warm air passes over the cool sea surface. However, precipitation is highly variable and long periods without any rainfall occur throughout the year. Unusual episodes of heavy rain sometimes occur, with a maximal {{convert|224|mm|in|2}} falling in November 1949.<ref>KNMI Climate explorer, Precipitation totals 1901–2000</ref>

This [[climate]] zone has summers that reach a maximum temperature of {{convert|41.7|C|F}} and a minimum temperature of {{convert|32|C|F}}. Winters have average nighttime temperatures of {{convert|21|C|F}} and a daytime maximum temperatures of {{convert|29|C|F|}}. There are barely any days in the year without sunshine, and even during the winter there are many clear days.

Djibouti is a multi-ethnic town. It has a population of around 777,000 residents (including suburbs like Balbala) in 2024, making it by far the largest settlement in the country.<ref name=CIA>{{cite web|title=Djibouti|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/djibouti/|work=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA|access-date=26 February 2013|date=5 February 2013}}</ref> The largest ethnic group are the [[Somalis|Somali]] and the second largest being [[Afar people|Afars]], both [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] speaking [[Cushitic peoples]]. The population of Djibouti City has risen exponentially with the successive waves of [[immigrants]] and [[refugees]] arriving throughout the 20th century. Many of the immigrants arrived from [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somalia]] in 1985 and 1991. In 2001 many [[undocumented immigrant]]s, were [[Deportation|expelled]] from Djibouti. Another mass wave of Yemeni refugees from [[Yemen]] arrived in 2015. Djibouti City was nicknamed the "French Hong Kong in the Red Sea" due to its cosmopolitan urbanism.<ref name="Kevin Anglin 2004 p. 698">Kevin Anglin, Becca Blond and Jean-Bernard Carillet, ''Africa on a Shoestring'' (London: Lonely Planet, 2004), p. 698.</ref> In 2023, the government of Djibouti has launched a major campaign to combat [[illegal immigration]], citing [[security]] and [[public health]] concerns.<ref>{{Cite web |last=|first=|url=https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20230430-government-of-djibouti-launches-crackdown-on-irregular-migrants |title=Government of Djibouti launches crackdown on 'irregular' migrants |work=France24 |date=2023 |access-date=1 May 2023}}</ref>
