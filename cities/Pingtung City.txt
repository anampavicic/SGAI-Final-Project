'''Pingtung City''' ([[Paiwan language|Taiwanese]]: {{lang|pwn|Akaw|links=no}}; {{zh|p=Píngdōng Shì}}; [[Hokkien]] [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī|POJ]]: ''Pîn-tong-chhī'') is a [[county-administered city]] and the [[county seat]] of [[Pingtung County]], [[Taiwan]].

==History==
The area of modern-day Pingtung City was originally a village of the [[Taiwanese Plains Aborigines]] which they called "Akau",{{sfnp|Campbell|1903|p=538|ps=. alternate spellings include Akou, Acouw, and Akauw}} which means "the forest". After the expulsion of the Dutch, the village grew into a Chinese market-town called "A-kau" ({{zh|c=阿猴|poj=A-kâu}}).

===Empire of Japan===
In 1901, during the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese era]], {{nihongo||阿猴廳|Akō Chō|lead=yes}} was one of twenty local administrative offices established. In 1909, this unit was merged with {{nihongo4||蕃薯寮廳|Banshoryō Chō}} and {{nihongo4||恆春廳|Kōshun Chō}} to form {{nihongo4||阿緱廳|Akō Chō}}. Beginning in 1920, the name was changed to {{nihongo4|Heitō Town|屏東街}}, governed under [[Takao Prefecture]]. In 1933, the town was upgraded to City status.

===Republic of China===
After the [[History of Taiwan since 1945|handover of Taiwan to the Republic of China from Japan]] on 25 October 1945, '''Pingtung City''' was established as a [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|provincial city]] of [[Taiwan Province]] in December the same year. On 1 December 1951, it was downgraded to a [[county-administered city]] of [[Pingtung County]] and has been administered as such since that time.

==Geography==
Pingtung City is located in northwestern Pingtung County. It is centered between the western coast and the eastern mountain range on the [[Pingtung Plain]]. Many residents work in [[Kaohsiung]] and commute daily by [[Taiwan Railways Administration|train]].

===Climate===
Pingtung City is located within the tropics and has a [[tropical monsoon climate]]. The warmest month is July and the coldest month is January. The warm season lasts from mid March to late November with an average daytime temperature of over 30 degrees Celsius. The short cooler season starts in mid December and lasts until late February, and features relatively warm days and cool nights with temperatures ranging from 15-27 degrees Celsius.
