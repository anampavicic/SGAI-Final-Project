'''Nakhon Ratchasima''' ({{langx|th|นครราชสีมา}}, {{IPA|th|ná(ʔ).kʰɔ̄ːn râːt.t͡ɕʰā.sǐː.māː|pron}}) is the capital of [[Nakhon Ratchasima province]], the largest city in [[Isan|Northeastern Thailand]] and the [[List of municipalities in Thailand#Largest cities by urban population|third-largest city]] in [[Thailand]]. It is 250 km (155.43 mi) northeast of [[Bangkok]], one of the four major cities of [[Isan]] (Northeast Thailand), known as the "big four of Isan", and has a population of 466,098 people as of 2021. The city is commonly known as '''Korat''' ({{lang|th|โคราช}}, {{IPA|th|kʰōː.râːt|pron}}), a shortened form of its name. 

Korat is at the western edge of the [[Korat Plateau]]. Historically, it once marked the boundary between [[Laos|Lao]] and [[Thailand|Siam]] territory. It is the gateway to the Lao-speaking northeast of Thailand.

==Toponymy==
Archaeological evidence suggests that in [[Amphoe Sung Noen|Sung Noen District]] 32&nbsp;km west of present-day Nakhon Ratchasima (Korat) there were two ancient towns called ''Sema'' ("[[Bai sema]]" ({{lang|th|ใบเสมา}}) are notable artifacts of the [[Korat plateau]]){{citation needed|date=November 2019}} and ''Khorakapura''. ([[Pali]] ''púra'' becomes [[Sanskrit]] ''puri'', hence [[Thai language|Thai]] ({{lang|th-Latn|buri}}), all connoting the same as Thai ''[[mueang]]'': "city with [[defensive wall]]".) N The latter name was shortened to ''Nakhon Raj''. ({{lang|th-Latn|Nakhon}} ([[wikt:นคร|นคร]]) derives from [[Sanskrit]] ''nagara'' ({{lang|sa|नगर}}), "city"; {{lang|th-Latn|Raj}} ([[wikt:ราช|ราช]]), from Sanskrit [[:wikt:raj|Raj]], "[[wikt:sovereign|sovereign]].") The present city name is a [[portmanteau]] of ''Nakhon Raj'' and ''Sema''.

The city is commonly known as "Korat" (Thai: โคราช), which is a short version of the ancient Khmer name "ankor raj".

==History==
[[File:Nakhonratchasima.JPG|250px|thumbnail|left|Ya Mo Entrance Gate at the junction of Ratchadamnoen Rd and Hwy 224]]
Prior to the 14th century, the area of Nakhon Ratchasima was under [[Khmer empire]] [[suzerainty]] and known in [[Khmer language|Khmer]] as ''Angkor raj'', ''Nokor Reach Seyma'', or ''Nokor Reach Borei'', and ''Koreach''. [[Phimai]], to the north, was probably more important.

King [[Narai]] of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] in the 17th century, ordered a new city built on the site to serve as a [[fortification|stronghold]] on Ayutthaya's northeastern frontier. Nakhon Ratchasima was thereafter mentioned in Siamese chronicles and legal documents as a "second-class" city of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. A royal governor ruled the city in a hereditary position.

After the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom#The final phase|final phase of the Ayutthaya kingdom]] ended with its [[Debellatio|complete destruction]] by the Burmese in 1767, a son of King [[Boromakot]] attempted to set himself up ruler in Phimai, holding sway over Korat and other eastern provinces. King [[Taksin]] of the [[Thonburi Kingdom]] (1768–1782) sent two of his generals, brothers [[Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke|Thong Duang]] and [[Maha Sura Singhanat|Boonma]], to defeat the prince, who was executed in 1768. Thong Duang later became King [[Rama (Kings of Thailand)|Rama]] I of the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|kingdom]], and Korat became his strategic stronghold on the northeastern frontier to supervise the Lao and Khmer [[tributary state]]s.

[[File:2019 0211 Nakhon Ratchasima train station.jpg|thumb|250px|Nakhon Ratchasima Railway Station]]

In 1826, [[Vientiane]] King [[wikt:เจ้า|Chao]] [[Anouvong]], perceiving [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] as weakened, attacked Korat in the [[Laotian Rebellion]] against King [[Rama III]] that was to rage on for two years.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chandler |first1=David P.|last2=Roff |first2=William R.|last3=Smail |first3=John R.W.|last4=Steinberg |first4=David Joel|last5=Taylor |first5=Robert H. |last6=Woodside |first6=Alexander |last7=Wyatt |first7=David K. |editor1-first=Steinberg |editor1-last=David |title= In search of south-east Asia|edition= Revised|year= 1987|orig-date= 1971|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|location= Honolulu |isbn= 0-8248-1110-0|oclc= 500095794|pages=113–117 |chapter= 13 Siam, 1767–1868}}</ref> [[Thao Suranaree|Lady Mo]], the wife of the deputy governor at the time, is credited with having freed the city from Anouvong's army, and has been honored with a statue in the center of downtown Korat. A full account of the war and its impact on Laos and Siam, is detailed in the book, ''Lady Mo and Heroism at Tung Samrit'', written by Frank G Anderson. The city's old wall, east of the monument was designed and built by a French engineer who is believed to be the one who also built [[Narai]]maharaj Palace in [[Lopburi]]. The French-based design is reflected in the moat system that surrounds the innermost portion of the city.<!-- This needs sorting out. Narai was king from 1656 to 1688, so who was the Frenchman and what did he design? Maybe Korat's design was inspired by that of the palace? See this somewhat garbled account of the monument http://mrchevy.com/SuranareeMonument.htm -->

Nakhon Ratchasima continued to be an important political and economic center in the northeastern region under the [[Monthon]] administrative reforms of the late-19th century. In November 1900, the [[State Railway of Thailand|Royal State Railways of Siam]] began operation of the Nakhon Ratchasima Line from Bangkok with [[Nakhon Ratchasima Station|Korat Station]] as its [[Terminal train station#Terminus|terminus]]. It was officially opened on 21 December 1900 by [[Chulalongkorn|King Chulalongkorn]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Siam's First Railway.|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] |date=28 December 1900 |url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19001228-1.2.55 |page=2|via=newspaperSG |access-date=2022-09-25}}</ref> The [[Ubon Ratchathani]] Line to the [[Amphoe Warin Chamrap|town of Warin]] opened 1 November 1922. The [[Thanon Chira Junction]] to [[Khon Kaen]] opened on 1 April 1933. ''Korat station'' was changed to [[Nakhon Ratchasima Railway Station]] in 1934.

In October 1933, after the [[Siamese revolution of 1932]] ended the [[absolute monarchy]], Nakhon Ratchasima became the headquarters of the [[Boworadet Rebellion]], an abortive uprising against the new government in Bangkok.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

During [[World War II]], the troops from Nakhon Ratchasima joined the fight in [[Franco-Thai War]], The Thai army was able to temporarily recapture some of the territory. After the war, the [[United States]] helped build [[Mittraphap Road]] from Saraburi to Nakhon Ratchasima.

In April 1981 during another [[Manoonkrit Roopkachorn#Attempted coup of 1981|attempted coup]], the government, together with the royal family, took refuge in Korat.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

From 1962 to 1976, during the [[Vietnam War]], [[Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base]] hosted components of the [[Royal Thai Air Force]], the [[United States Air Force]], and a complement of the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] (RNZAF). After the US withdrawal in 1976, the Thai Air Force assumed full control. During the 1980s and early 1990s, the airfield was jointly operated as a civil airport for Nakhon Ratchasima. This ended with the opening of [[Nakhon Ratchasima Airport]] in the early 1990s.

On 13 August 1993, Thailand's worst disaster happened in the city, the [[collapse of the Royal Plaza Hotel]], killing 137 people.<ref name="nation">{{cite news|title=Court orders five to pay Bt152 million compensation for Korat Hotel collapse|newspaper=The Nation|date=7 March 2009|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2009/03/05/national/national_30097253.php|access-date=9 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330003249/http://nationmultimedia.com/2009/03/05/national/national_30097253.php|archive-date=30 March 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On 8 and 9 February 2020, Thailand's [[Nakhon Ratchasima shootings|deadliest shooting]] occurred in the city, when an offduty [[Royal Thai Army]] Sergeant shot 29 people dead and wounded 58 others, mostly at the local [[Terminal 21]] mall, before being killed by responding officers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-shooting-timeline-idUSKBN2030FQ|title=One gunman, four locations, 29 dead: how the mass shooting in Thailand unfolded|date=9 February 2020|work=Reuters|access-date=9 January 2021}}</ref>

== Demography ==
{{Further|List of municipalities in Thailand}}
{{Asof|2019}}, Nakhon Ratchasima Municipality had a population of 126,391. This number represents only part of the city's current size. 

To reflect the population growth since Korat's original designation as a city municipality (''[[Thesaban|thesaban nakhon]]'') in 1995, both the '''Department of Public Works and Town & Country Planning''' and the '''Nakhon Ratchasima Provincial Administrative Organization''' regularly publish up-to-date city boundaries ({{langx|th|เขตเมือง}}).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Department of Public Works and Town & Country Planning, City plans, Nakhon Ratchasima |url=https://onedptgis.dpt.go.th/onedpt-complain-ppl/}}</ref> These boundaries extend the original municipal borders into adjacent sub-districts, and comprise the whole Capital district of [[Mueang Nakhon Ratchasima district|Mueang Nakhon Ratchasima]], which forms Korat's urban area. Korat is the [[List of municipalities in Thailand#Largest cities by urban population|third-largest city]] in [[Thailand]] behind [[Bangkok]] and [[Chiang Mai]] with an urban population of 466,098 as of 2021, which amounts to 17.7 percent of the total population of [[Nakhon Ratchasima province]] (2.6 million).<ref name="TDD" />

Korat's economy has traditionally been heavily dependent on agriculture. It is known as a processing centre for Isan's production of rice, tapioca, and sugar. The Isan region accounts for half of Thailand's exports of those commodities. Together, these three agricultural commodities employ 700,000 Isan families. Korat is also one of two sites in Thailand manufacturing disk drives by [[Seagate Technology]], employing 12,100 workers in Korat.<ref name="NAR-20161102" /><ref>{{cite news|last1=Temphairojana|first1=Pairat|title=Seagate to invest $470 mln in Thailand over next 5 years|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-seagate-technolo-idUSKBN0LE15720150210|access-date=3 November 2016|work=Reuters|date=2015-02-10}}</ref>
