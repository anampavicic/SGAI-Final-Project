==History==
[[File:Stupin monument in Arzamas.JPG|thumb|left|Monument to Alexander Stupin]]

Arzamas was founded in 1578<ref name="gr">{{cite book|title=Энциклопедия Города России|year=2003|publisher=Большая Российская Энциклопедия|location=Moscow|isbn=5-7107-7399-9|page=23}}</ref> by [[Ivan the Terrible]] in the lands populated at the time by [[Mordvins]]. By 1737, more than 7,000 people lived in Arzamas and the town became a major transit centre on the route from [[Moscow]] to eastern parts of Russia. It was known for its [[domestic goose|geese]] and [[onion]]s as well as leather crafts.

[[Catherine the Great]] in 1781 granted town status to Arzamas and a coat of arms based on the colours of the Arzamas regiment.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} In the early 19th century, Arzamas had over twenty churches and cathedrals, the foremost being the Resurrection Cathedral. It was built in the Empire style to commemorate the Russian victory over [[Napoleon]] in 1812.

[[Alexander Stupin]] art school was located in Arzamas between 1802 and 1862 and many famous Russian artists studied there, including [[Vasily Perov]].

By the early 20th century it was still an important centre of trade, and had tanneries, oil, flour, tallow, dye, soap and iron works; knitting was an important domestic industry, while sheepskins and sail-cloth were articles of trade. The 1897 population was 10,591.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Arzamas|volume=2|page=713}}</ref>

From 1954 to 1957, Arzamas was the center of [[Arzamas Oblast]], a short-lived administrative unit that was split from [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Gorky Oblast]] and later merged back into it.

In 1988, the city was the site of the [[Arzamas train disaster]] which caused the death of ninety-one people.
