== History ==
Mianyang, which was known as Fuxian (Fu County) in ancient times, had advanced in agriculture during the [[Qin dynasty|Qin]]  (221−206 BCE) and [[Han dynasty|Han]] (206 BCE−220 CE) dynasties. It has a history of over 2,200 years since the [[Emperor Gaozu of Han]] established the first county in this area in 201 BCE. Due to its advantageous location, it had always been a town of great military importance and formed a natural defence for Chengdu.<ref>{{ cite web |url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/cityguides/sichuan/mianyang/ |title=Mianyang Travel Guide}}</ref>

Mianyang is home to the CAEP and Science City, an immense Military Research Complex which was the site of the development of China's first nuclear bomb.<ref>{{Cite web |title=绵阳市情简介_绵阳概况_绵阳市人民政府 |trans-title=Mianyang City Profile_Mianyang Overview_Mianyang Municipal People's Government |url=http://www.my.gov.cn/mysrmzf/c100131/202303/921a1ea90ad94f4a9fc5418f7c60f467.shtml |access-date=2024-06-11 |website=www.my.gov.cn}}</ref>

The city proper itself was only lightly damaged by the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake|earthquake]] of 12 May 2008. However, [[Beichuan County]], which is in the prefecture, was among the most severely hit of all disaster regions following the earthquake, including the [[Beichuan High School]] campus where more than 1,000 students lost their lives after two main buildings collapsed.<ref>
