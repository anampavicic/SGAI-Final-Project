==History==
The city was founded by [[Wazir Khan (Lahore)|Wazir Khan]], the governor and later [[List of Mughal Grand Viziers|Grand Vizier]] of [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Shah Jahan]], in the 17th century. The town was taken over by [[Charat Singh]] around 1760, together with other towns in the district. Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] occupied the town in 1809, and [[Paolo Di Avitabile|Avitabile]] was appointed as the [[Nazim]] of the city. In 1855, Jarral Rajputs of Rajouri's own Saman Burj Wazirabad ruled Wazirabad. He built an entirely new town, with a straight, broad bazaar running through it and side streets at right angles.<ref name="IGI">{{Cite web|title=Wazirabad|website=Imperial Gazetteer2 of India, Volume 24, page 378 -- Imperial Gazetteer of India -- Digital South Asia Library|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V24_384.gif}}</ref>

===British rule===
During [[British Raj|British rule]], Wazirabad was the headquarters of the old Wazirabad District, broken up in 1851-2, and was the site of a military cantonment moved to [[Sialkot]] in 1855.{{cn|date=November 2022}}

The municipality was created in 1867; the population, according to the 1901 census, was 18,069. The income during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 20,800, and the expenditure Rs. 21,400. In 1903-04, the income was Rs. 20,800, chiefly from [[octroi]], and the expenditure was Rs. 19,200. The town had a considerable trade in timber, which comes down the [[Chenab]] from [[Jammu]] territory.<ref name="IGI"/> The smiths of Wazirabad had a reputation for the manufacture of small articles of cutlery, and the town of Nizamabad within a mile of the town is famed for its weapons. Wazirabad was an important junction on the [[North Western Railway (British India)|North-Western Railway]], as the [[Jammu-Sialkot Line|Sialkot-Jammu]] and Lyallpur lines both branch off of here.<ref name="IGI379">{{Cite web|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V24_385.gif|title=Wazirabad|website=Imperial Gazetteer2 of India, Volume 24, page 379 -- Imperial Gazetteer of India -- Digital South Asia Library, University of Chicago}}</ref>
