According to historical records,{{which|date=October 2011}} collection and production of sea salt in the region began as early as 119 BC, during the [[Western Han dynasty]], when the settlement on the current location of Yancheng was named Yandu County ({{lang|zh-hans|盐渎县}}). According to the [[Seventh National Population Census of the People's Republic of China|2020 census]], Yancheng had a [[Permanent residency|registered population]] of 6,709,629, with 1,733,591 inhabitants in its built up area comprising the districts of Tinghu and Yandu.

==History==
Yancheng has a history of 2,100 years since the first canton was founded here in the [[Han dynasty]] at the year 119 BC. It was named for the salt reserves in rivers around the area, its name literally meaning "Salt City". In later years, the city was the home of [[Fan Zhongyan]], the 12th century statesman and [[Shi Nai'an]], the reputed author of famous novels.<ref name="Introduction">{{cite web |url=http://www.ycmiddleschool.com/yan.asp |title=Yancheng Introduction (Yancheng Middle School)}}</ref>

Yancheng was in the limelight during the [[Chinese Civil War]] from the 1930s to 1940s. The [[New Fourth Army]] led by the [[Chinese Communist Party]] was reestablished in Yancheng after being ambushed and battered by the enemy. After the revival, the Army played a very important role in the war and finally the foundation of the [[People's Republic of China]]. Many monuments in honor of these heroes can still be found around Yancheng.<ref name="Introduction" />

Yancheng occupies roughly {{cvt|582|km}} of coastline, more than half of the whole province. By the end of the [[Mesolithic]] period, the [[marine transgression]]s changed almost of the area into a shallow bay. Continued deposition of silt carried by the Yangtze River and the Huai River extend its coast to the east gradually. Since 1128, the course of the Yellow River have changed to join up with the Huai River. The change has accelerated.{{Citation needed|date=October 2024}}

Typical of northern and central Jiangsu, Yancheng has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa/Cwa''), strongly influenced by the [[East Asian Monsoon]].
