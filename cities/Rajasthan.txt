The [[Western Kshatrapas]] (405–35 BCE), the [[Saka]] rulers of the western part of India, were successors to the [[Indo-Scythians]] and were contemporaneous with the [[Kushans]], who ruled the northern part of the [[Indian subcontinent]].

The [[Gurjara-Pratihara|Gurjara Pratihar Empire]] acted as a barrier for [[Arab]] invaders from the 8th to the 11th century. The chief accomplishment of the Gurjara-Pratihara Empire lies in its successful resistance to foreign invasions from the west, starting in the days of [[Junaid]]. Historian [[R. C. Majumdar]] says that this was openly acknowledged by the Arab writers. He further notes that historians of India have wondered at the slow progress of Muslim invaders in India, as compared with their rapid advance in other parts of the world. Now there seems little doubt that it was the power of the Pratihara army that effectively barred the progress of the Arabs beyond the confines of [[Sindh]], their only conquest for nearly 300 years.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Ancient India: Earliest Times to 1000 A.D.|author=Radhey Shyam Chaurasia|pages=207–208|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cWmsQQ2smXIC&pg=PA207|publisher=Atlantic|year=2002|isbn=978-81-269-0027-5}}</ref>

The [[Ghurids]] had made an attempt to invade India through southern Rajasthan, however they were defeated in the [[Battle of Kasahrada]] on 1178 by a confederacy of Rajputs under [[Mularaja II]] of the [[Kingdom of Gujarat]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bhatia|first=P.|title=The Paramāras: (c. 800 - 1305 A.D.) ; a Study in the Political and Cultural History of Their Kingdoms|publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal|year=1970| isbn=978-81-215-0410-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CW6oyAEACAAJ|access-date=1 May 2022}}</ref> [[Prithviraj Chauhan]] led a confederacy of Rajput clans and defeated the invading Ghruids under [[Muhammad Ghori]] in the [[First Battle of Tarain]] in 1191. In 1192 CE, Muhammad Ghori decisively defeated Prithviraj at the [[Second Battle of Tarain]]. After the defeat of Chauhan in 1192 CE, a part of Rajasthan came under Muslim rulers. The principal centers of their powers were [[Nagaur]] and Ajmer. [[Ranthambore Fort|Ranthambhore]] was also under their suzerainty. At the beginning of the 13th century, the most prominent and powerful state of Rajasthan was [[Mewar]]. Since the invasion of the Muslim Turks from the 13th century onwards, the Rajputs resisted the Muslim incursions into India, and preserved [[Hindu culture]] at their courts.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Jain |first=Kulbhushan |title=Paradigms of Indian Architecture |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |isbn=9780700710386 |pages=159 |chapter=Spatial Organisation and Aesthetic Expression in the Traditional Architecture of Rajasthan}}</ref> 
 
The Rajputs put up resistance to the Islamic invasions with their warfare and chivalry for centuries. The Ranas of Mewar led other kingdoms in their resistance to outside rule. Rana [[Hammir Singh]] defeated the [[Tughlaq dynasty]] and recovered a large portion of Rajasthan. The indomitable [[Kumbha of Mewar|Rana Kumbha]] defeated the Sultans of [[Malwa Sultanate|Malwa]], Nagaur and [[Gujarat Sultanate|Gujarat]] and made Mewar the most powerful Rajput Kingdom in India. The ambitious [[Rana Sanga]] united the various Rajput clans, including the [[Khanzadas of Mewat|Muslim Khanzadas of Mewat]] under [[Hasan Khan Mewati|Raja Hasan Khan Mewati]], and fought against the foreign powers in India. Rana Sanga defeated the Afghan [[Lodi Empire]] of Delhi and crushed the Turkic Sultanates of Malwa and Gujarat. Rana Sanga then tried to create an Indian empire but was defeated by the first [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Babur]] at [[Khanwa]]. The defeat was due to betrayal by the Tomar King [[Silhadi]] of Raisen. After [[Rana Sanga]]'s death, [[Marwar]] rose as a power center in Rajasthan under Rao [[Maldeo Rathore]]. He conquered Jaisalmer, parts of Gujarat, Jalore, Nagaur, Ajmer, Sanchore, Bhinmal, Radhanpur, Bayana, Tonk, Toda and Nabhara. He expanded the territories of Marwar up to Sindh-Cholistan in west and his northern boundary was just fifty kilometres from Delhi.<ref>Rima Hooja, "The State of Marwar/Jodhpur", in ''History of Rajasthan'', pp. 520–522</ref><ref>Majumdar, R.C., ed.

During [[Akbar]]'s reign most of the Rajput kings accepted Mughal suzerainty, but the rulers of Mewar (Rana [[Udai Singh II]]) and Marwar (Rao [[Chandrasen Rathore]]) refused to have any form of alliance with the Mughals. To teach the Rajputs a lesson Akbar attacked Udai Singh and killed Rajput commander Jaimal of Chitor and the citizens of Mewar in large numbers. Akbar killed 20,000–25,000 unarmed citizens in Chittor on the grounds that they had actively helped in the resistance.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=John F.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&pg=PA26|title=The Mughal Empire|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-56603-2|page=26|author-link=John F.

[[Maharana Pratap]] took an oath to avenge the citizens of Chittor; he fought the Mughal empire till his death and liberated most of Mewar apart from Chittor itself. [[Maharana Pratap]] soon became the most celebrated warrior of Rajasthan and became famous all over India for his sporadic warfare and noble actions. According to [[Satish Chandra]], "Rana Pratap's defiance of the mighty Mughal empire, almost alone and unaided by the other Rajput states, constitutes a glorious saga of Rajput valor and the spirit of self-sacrifice for cherished principles. Rana Pratap's methods of sporadic warfare were later elaborated further by Malik Ambar, the Deccani general, and by Shivaji".<ref name="Satish Chandra">{{cite book|last1=Chandra|first1=Satish|title=Medieval India|year=2000|publisher=National Council of Educational Research and Training|location=New Delhi|page=164}}</ref>

Rana [[Amar Singh I]] continued his ancestor's war against the Mughals under [[Jehangir]], he repelled the Mughal armies at Dewar. Later an expedition was again sent under the leadership of Prince [[Shah Jahan|Khurram]], which caused much damage to life and property of [[Mewar]]. Many temples were destroyed, several villages were put on fire and women and children were captured and tortured to make Amar Singh accept surrender.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pant |first=Ashok |date=2012 |title=The Truth of Babri Mosque |isbn=9781475942897 |page=129|publisher=iUniverse }}</ref>

After Aurangzeb's death [[Bahadur Shah I]] tried to subjugate Rajasthan like his ancestors but his plan backfired when the three [[Rajput]] [[Raja]]s of [[Jaipur State|Amber]], [[Udaipur State|Udaipur]], and [[Jodhpur State|Jodhpur]] made a joint resistance to the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]]. The Rajputs first expelled the commandants of [[Jodhpur]] and [[Bayana]] and recovered [[Amer, India|Amer]] by a night attack. They next killed Sayyid Hussain Khan Barha, the commandant of [[Mewat]] and many other Mughal officers.

Over the years, the Mughals began to have internal disputes which greatly distracted them at times. The Mughal Empire continued to weaken, and with the decline of the Mughal Empire in the late 18th century, [[Rajputana]] came under the influence of the [[Maratha Confederacy|Marathas]]. The Maratha Empire, which had replaced the Mughal Empire as the overlord of the subcontinent, was finally replaced by the [[British Empire]] in 1818.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hallissey|first=Robert C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3jRuAAAAMAAJ|title=The Rajput Rebellion Against Aurangzeb: A Study of the Mughal Empire in Seventeenth-century India|date=1977|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=978-0-8262-0222-2|pages=34–41}}</ref>

In the 19th century, the Rajput kingdoms were exhausted, they had been drained financially and in manpower after continuous wars and due to heavy tributes exacted by the [[Maratha Empire]]. To save their kingdoms from instability, rebellions and banditry the Rajput kings concluded treaties with the British in the early 19th century, accepting British [[suzerainty]] and control over their external affairs in return for internal autonomy.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bhargava|first=Visheshwar Sarup|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dbY9AAAAIAAJ|title=Marwar and the Mughal Emperors (A.D. 1526–1748)|date=1966|publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal|pages=123–126|isbn=9788121504003}}</ref>

About three-fifths of Rajasthan lies northwest of the Aravallis, leaving two-fifths on the east and south direction.

[[File:Mount Abu.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Abu]].]]

The Aravalli Range runs across the state from the southwest peak [[Guru Shikhar]] (Mount Abu), which is {{convert|1722|m}} in height, to [[Khetri]] in the northeast.<ref name="Topographical">{{cite web |title=Topographical divisions |url=https://foundation.rajasthan.gov.in/Topographicaldivisions.aspx |publisher=Rajasthan Foundation |access-date=3 August 2023 |archive-date=3 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230803103903/https://foundation.rajasthan.gov.in/Topographicaldivisions.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref> This range divides the state into 60% in the northwest of the range and 40% in the southeast. The northwest tract is sandy and unproductive with little water but improves gradually from desert land in the far west and northwest to comparatively fertile and habitable land towards the east. The south-eastern area, higher in elevation (100 to 350&nbsp;m above sea level) and more fertile, has a very diversified topography. In the south lies the hilly tract of Mewar. In the southeast, a large area within the districts of [[Kota district|Kota]] and [[Bundi]] forms a tableland.<ref name="Topographical"/> To the northeast of these districts is a rugged region (badlands) following the line of the [[Chambal River]]. Farther north the country levels out; the flat plains of the northeastern [[Bharatpur district]] are part of an [[alluvial]] basin. [[Merta City]] lies in the geographical center of Rajasthan.<ref name="Topographical"/>

The Aravalli Range and the lands to the east and southeast of the range are generally more fertile and better watered. This region is home to the [[Khathiar-Gir dry deciduous forests]] ecoregion, with [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry broadleaf forests]] that include [[teak]], ''[[Acacia]]'', and other trees. The hilly [[Vagad]] region, home to the cities of [[Dungarpur]], [[Pratapgarh, Rajasthan|Pratapgarh]], and [[Banswara]] lies in southernmost Rajasthan, on the border with Gujarat and [[Madhya Pradesh]]. With the exception of Mount Abu, Vagad is the wettest region in Rajasthan, and the most heavily forested. North of Vagad lies the [[Mewar]] region, home to the cities of [[Udaipur]] and [[Chittaurgarh]]. The [[Hadoti]] region lies to the southeast, on the border with Madhya Pradesh. North of Hadoti and Mewar lies the [[Dhundhar]] region, home to the state capital of [[Jaipur]]. [[Mewat]], the easternmost region of Rajasthan, borders [[Haryana]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Eastern and southeastern Rajasthan is drained by the [[Banas River|Banas]] and [[Chambal River|Chambal]] rivers, tributaries of the [[Ganges]].

The northwestern portion of Rajasthan is generally sandy and dry. Most of this region is covered by the [[Thar Desert]] which extends into adjoining portions of Pakistan. The Aravalli Range does not intercept the moisture-giving southwest [[monsoon]] winds off the [[Arabian Sea]], as it lies in a direction parallel to that of the coming monsoon winds, leaving the northwestern region in a [[rain shadow]]. The Thar Desert is thinly populated; the City of [[Jodhpur]] is the largest city in the desert and a major metropolitan area of India which is known as the gateway of the Thar desert. The desert has some major districts like [[Jodhpur district|Jodhpur]], Jaisalmer, Barmer, [[Bikaner]], and [[Nagaur district|Nagaur]]. This area is also important from a defence point of view. [[Jodhpur]] airbase is one of the largest airbases in India, BSF and Military bases are also situated here. Currently four civil airports are located here: Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Bikaner and Nagaur, of which Jodhpur is the major civil airport, being the 44th busiest airport in India and one of the oldest air strips of India, being built in the 1920s.

The [[Northwestern thorn scrub forests]] lie in a band around the Thar Desert, between the desert and the Aravallis. This region receives less than 400&nbsp; mm of rain annually. Temperatures can sometimes exceed 45&nbsp;°C in the summer months and drop below freezing point in the winter. The [[Godwar]], [[Marwar]], and [[Shekhawati]] [[List of regions in India|regions]] lie in the thorn scrub forest zone, along with the city of Jodhpur. The [[Luni River]] and its tributaries are the major river system of Godwar and Marwar regions, draining the western slopes of the Aravallis and emptying southwest into the great [[Rann of Kutch]] wetland in neighbouring [[Gujarat]]. This river is saline in the lower reaches and remains potable only up to Balotara in [[Barmer district]]. The [[Ghaggar River]], which originates in [[Haryana]], is an intermittent stream that disappears into the sands of the Thar Desert in the northern corner of the state and is seen as a remnant of the primitive [[Sarasvati river]].

=== Food ===
[[File:Rajasthani food.jpg|thumb|Rajasthani food]]
[[Rajasthani cuisine|Rajasthani cooking]] was influenced by both the war-like lifestyles of its inhabitants and the availability of ingredients in this arid region. Food that could last for several days and could be eaten without heating was preferred. Thus, pickles of Rajasthan are quite famous for their tangy and spicy flavour. The ''Panchkuta'' delicacy is also a famous one – meaning 5 vegetables – a dish that lasts for several days, and is made out of certain weed plants that only grow in the wild desert. The scarcity of water and fresh green vegetables have all had their effect on cooking. It is known for its snacks like [[Bikaneri Bhujia]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=It's one of India's tastiest snacks.

In recent years, Rajasthan has worked on improving education. The state government has been making sustained efforts to raise the education standard.

Schools in the state are either managed by the government or by private trusts. The medium of instruction in most of the schools is mainly English, or Hindi. Under the [[10+2+3 plan]], after completing secondary school, students typically enroll for two years in a [[junior college]], also known as pre-university, or in schools with a higher secondary facility affiliated with the [[Board of Secondary Education, Rajasthan|Board of Secondary Education]] or any central board. Students choose from one of three streams, namely [[liberal arts]], commerce, or science. Upon completing the required coursework, students may enrol in general or professional degree programs.
