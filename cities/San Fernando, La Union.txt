'''San Fernando''', officially the '''City of San Fernando''' ({{langx|ilo|Siudad ti San Fernando}}; {{langx|pag|Syudad na San Fernando}}; {{langx|fil|Lungsod ng San Fernando}}), is a 3rd class [[component city]] and the capital of the province of [[La Union]], Philippines. It is a coastal city consisting of fifty-nine (59) barangays and covers an area of 105.26 square kilometers. According to the 2020 census, the city has a population of 125,642.{{PH census|current}} San Fernando serves as the gateway to trade and commerce to the North and the culture and heritage of Ilocandia.

The City is the regional and administrative capital of [[Ilocos Region]], hosts several regional and field offices of national government agencies, regional branches of government financial institutions, and various government-owned and controlled corporations. The city is home to some of the region’s premier educational and medical institutions, including the [[Ilocos Training and Regional Medical Center]], recognized as the core of public health and medical care in Ilocos Region.

It is one of the two capital cities named San Fernando, the other being [[San Fernando, Pampanga]] in [[Central Luzon]].

==History==
=== Early History ===
[[File:Philippine Island - Luzon Island - NARA - 68157043.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of San Fernando, circa 1940s]]

San Fernando has a rich history that traces back to its early days as a settlement of ''Samtoy'' ([[Ilocano people|Ilocano]]) communities situated along its coastal shores and riverbanks. This area was part of the northern section of [[Caboloan]], where these communities practiced [[animistic beliefs]] and were known for their gold mines, farming and seafaring. They actively engaged in trade with neighboring groups, including the [[Pangasinan people|Pangasinenses]], [[Igorot people|Igorots]], [[Chinese in the Philippines|Chinese]], and [[Japanese in the Philippines|Japanese]]. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Scott |first1=William |title=The Discovery of the Igorots |date=1974 |publisher=New Day Publishers |location=Quezon City |isbn=9711000873 |page=58}}</ref>

<big>'''Spanish Regime'''</big>

In June 1572, Spanish conquistador [[Juan de Salcedo]] arrived in San Fernando after successfully pacifying the native and Japanese settlers in ''Aroo'' or ''Agoho'' ([[Agoo]]), which he had named ''"El Puerto de Japon"'' due to its status as a Japanese trading post. Upon reaching San Fernando, Salcedo encountered the natives and demanded tribute for the Queen of Spain. The natives requested time to gather the tribute from the mountains but never returned. Salcedo then continued northward, ultimately establishing [[Vigan]] as the center of Spanish governance and influence in Northern Luzon, where the efforts to convert natives to [[Christianity in the Philippines|Christianity]] began.<ref name="Pangasinan">{{Cite book |title=Pangasinan, 1572-1800 |last=Mendoza-Cortes |first=Rosario |publisher=University of the Philippines Press |year=1974 |location=Quezon City |author-link=Mendoza-Cortes}}</ref>

By 1759, the early settlements of San Fernando comprised two barrios: ''San Guillermo de Dalangdang'', nestled at the foothills of the Cordillera mountains, and ''San Vicente de Balanac'', a coastal village. San Guillermo frequently fell victim to ''[[headhunting]]'' Igorots during the blooming of the [[Delonix regia|''Albor'']] trees (''fire tree''), as they believed sacrifices were essential to appease their gods. Meanwhile, during the calm summer months, San Vicente de Balanac was raided by ''Tirongs'' and ''[[Moro pirate|Moro]]'' pirates, who abducted women and children, leaving destruction in their wake. 

In response to these relentless attacks, ''Father Jose Torres'', an Augustinian priest, urged the remaining populations of both [[Barrio|barrios]] to unite for their protection. In 1762, they established a new settlement called ''Pindangan'', characterized by a massive church named after the Ilocano term ''"pindang,"'' which means to dry fish. The name "Pindangan" thus referred to the place where fish were dried. Unfortunately, the church was later destroyed by a significant earthquake. 

In 1764, ''Don Santiago Olarte'' was appointed as Pindangan’s first ''[[Gobernadorcillo]]'', a title equivalent to the modern-day mayor. Instead of rebuilding the church in the same location, the Franciscans opted to move it during the rainy season until they found a suitable place. This church eventually became known as the [[Cathedral of St. William the Hermit]], part of the Diocese of San Fernando, La Union. 

On May 6, 1786, Pindangan was officially renamed and founded as ''"Ministerio de San Fernando"'' by Fr. Fernando Rey, in honor of King Ferdinand of Spain. However, due to a shortage of priests between 1792 and 1831, San Fernando became a ''“visita”'' of [[Bauang]] and [[San Juan, La Union|San Juan]]. It was not until 1831 that ''Father Juan Sorolla'', who had served as the parish priest of Bauang in 1829, was assigned to San Fernando, further solidifying its religious significance.

'''San Fernando as the Cabecera'''

On October 29, 1849, ''Governor General Narciso Zaldua Claveria'' issued a ''promovido'' that unified eight northern towns of [[Pangasinan]], three southern towns of [[Ilocos Sur]] south of the [[Amburayan River]], and eight western settlements of [[Cordillera Administrative Region|Eastern Pais del Igorotes]] in the Cordilleras to form the province of La Union. On March 2, 1850, ''Governor General Antonio Maria Blanco'' signed the ''Superior Decreto'' establishing La Union, designating San Fernando as its capital or cabecera. Captain ''Toribio Ruiz de la Escalera'' was appointed as the first ''Gobernador Militar y Politico''. 

The creation of La Union was officially ratified by a Royal Decree from [[Isabella II|Queen Isabella II]] of Spain on April 18, 1854. By the late 19th century, an influx of settlers from the Ilocos provinces led to San Fernando being predominantly inhabited by Ilocanos and Ilocanized Pangasinenses.

'''<big>Philippine Revolution (1896-1898)</big>'''

On September 10, 1896, shortly after the [[Cry of Pugad Lawin]], a significant event unfolded in San Fernando when Spanish authorities uncovered a conspiracy against the colonial government. Leading the crackdown was ''Fray Rafael Redondo'', the ''Vicar Forane'' of San Fernando, who acted swiftly against suspected revolutionaries. Among the first arrested was ''Dr. Lucino Almeida'', a respected community figure targeted for his alleged involvement in the revolutionary movement, which had gained momentum following the events of Pugad Lawin and the increasing influence of the Katipunan, led by [[Andrés Bonifacio]]. 

On September 17, 1896, three native coadjutor priests from La Union, including ''Padre Mariano Gaerlan'' of San Fernando, were tortured for their alleged participation in a conspiracy against the Spanish colonial government, deepening the people's resentment toward Spanish rule. <ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=History-City of San Fernando-Provincial Government of La Union |url=https://launion.gov.ph/city-of-san-fernando/#:~:text=The%20City%20of%20San%20Fernando%20is%20situated%20in%20the%20mountainous,Union%20became%20province%20in%201850.}}</ref>

The Philippine Revolution erupted in 1898, sparking a nationwide movement for independence. On July 22, 1898, Filipino insurgents, led by [[Manuel Tinio|''General Manuel Tinio'']]'', General Mauro Ortiz'', and ''Major Joaquin Alejandrino'', attacked the Spanish garrison in San Fernando with over 600 men. The Spanish, commanded by ''Colonel Jose Garcia Herrero'', fortified key buildings and awaited reinforcements. Despite Tinio's attempts at peaceful negotiation, the Spanish forces refused to surrender. After several days of deadlock, Tinio launched an assault on July 31, resulting in a fierce battle that culminated in the Spaniards' surrender. This event marked the signing of the ''Actas de Capitulaciones'' (Acts of Surrender). San Fernando became the 13th of 29 towns and cities to witness the Spanish capitulation, with 400 soldiers, eight officers, and substantial military resources surrendering. After a century of Spanish colonization, San Fernando was finally liberated, and for the first time since its founding on March 2, 1850, a Filipino assumed authority over the Casa Real.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About CSF City Government of San Fernando, La Union |url=https://www.sanfernandocity.gov.ph/csflu_website/aboutcsf/}}</ref>

<big>'''American Regime (1899-1901)'''</big>

After the [[Spanish–American War|Spanish-American War]] of 1898, the Philippines was ceded to the [[United States]] under the ''[[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]]'', marking the beginning of American colonization. Following the [[Philippine–American War|Philippine-American War]] (1899–1902), San Fernando, La Union, became a focal point of military conflicts as American forces sought to gain control. The town witnessed significant abuses, including ''forced relocations, killings,'' and ''property destruction'', which only deepened the people's resentment and fueled resistance. Despite this, San Fernando eventually came under American administration, leading to significant political, economic, and social transformations. 

One notable military event was the naval bombardment by American forces. This occurred as [[Gregorio del Pilar|General Gregorio del Pilar]] led a rear-guard action to cover [[Emilio Aguinaldo|General Emilio Aguinaldo's]] retreat. However, Aguinaldo and his soldiers were eventually captured. After these events, peace and order were restored, and the American democratic form of governance replaced the oppressive Spanish colonial rule. The people of San Fernando, like many others in the Philippines, took advantage of the opportunities the Americans introduced, both politically and economically, leading to the town's progress. 

On August 1, 1899, a U.S. merchant ship, the ''“Saturmus”'', attempted to dock in San Fernando but was captured by revolutionary forces. Following this, the U.S. Navy retaliated on August 7, bombarding San Fernando and reducing much of the town to ruins. In November of that same year, President Emilio Aguinaldo passed through La Union, while on November 21, [[Samuel Baldwin Marks Young|''General Samuel Baldwin Marks Young'']] led the U.S. Expeditionary Forces to occupy San Fernando, marking the official start of American occupation in La Union. <ref name=":0" />

By May 1, 1901, the surrender of the ''General Manuel Tinio'' Brigade signaled the end of the Philippine-American War in La Union. Later that year, on August 14, [[William Howard Taft|Governor General William Howard Taft]] arrived at San Fernando Harbor, greeted by ''Don Joaquin Ortega'' and other local officials. Taft's visit marked the introduction of American civil governance in the province. Just days later, on August 17, Don Joaquin Ortega was declared the first ''Civil Governor of La Union''. 

Under American rule, agriculture and education thrived, with the introduction of American teachers playing a crucial role in these developments. Despite the progress made under the new government, the era was not without tragedy on November 8, 1901, ''Colonel Juan M. Gutierrez'', a native of La Union, became the last top-ranking Filipino officer publicly hanged by the Americans in San Fernando. The American regime brought a new era of political and social change to San Fernando, replacing Spanish rule with democratic ideals while fostering significant economic development, though at the cost of local resistance and loss.<ref name=":0" />

=== World War II ===
In the [[Second World War]], the last battle of San Fernando was fought during the Japanese occupation at Barangay Bacsil. The Bacsil Ridge Monument was built on the site in the city, the north-eastern portion of the town plaza. The victory enabled the establishment of the United States Army Base, Base M at [[Poro Point]] (a buildup area for the Japan invasion) and a [[Naval Base Lingayen|US Navy Base]].<ref name="LocalPHCom">{{Cite web |url=http://www.localphilippines.com/attractions/1240/battle-of-san-fernando-marker |title=Battle of San Fernando Marker in San Fernando (La Union) |website=localphilippines.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602200236/http://www.localphilippines.com/attractions/1240/battle-of-san-fernando-marker |archive-date=June 2, 2014 |access-date=October 4, 2016}}</ref> The town was liberated in 1945.<ref name="SanFernandoCityGovPH-History">{{Cite web |url=http://www.sanfernandocity.gov.ph/city/history.php |title=History |website=Official Website of San Fernando, La Union |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127062703/http://www.sanfernandocity.gov.ph/city/history.php |archive-date=January 27, 2015 |access-date=October 4, 2016}}</ref>

'''The Battle of Bacsil Ridge'''

The Battle of Bacsil Ridge which was fought in March 1945 was one of the main battles of the Philippines Campaign of the [[World War II|Second World War]] between the Filipino soldiers under the 121st Infantry Regiment, [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]], USAFIP-NL, under the command of [[Russell W. Volckmann]], and the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Imperial]] forces under [[Tomoyuki Yamashita|General Tomoyuki Yamashita]].<ref>Volckmann, R., 1954, We Remained, New York:W.W.Norton & Company, Inc., {{ISBN|9780393350227}}</ref>

The Battle of Bacsil Ridge ended the month-long battle for control of San Fernando. The Japanese defenders called the Hayashi Detachment, composed of 3,000 armed troops and 2,000 unarmed support forces, took hold of San Fernando and its surrounding areas and denied entry to the port of the city and a road leading to [[Baguio]]. As part of the San Fernando-Bacsil Operations, the 1st Battalion of 121st Infantry were sent to loosen the enemy positions starting late February with the assistance of the Allied Air Force.

The 1st Battalion made a general attack to the ridge on March 16, 1945 and fought the Japanese defenders until the capture of Bacsil on March 19. On the same day, the 3rd battalion captured Reservoir Hill. The Battle of Bacsil Ridge between the Filipino guerrillas and the Japanese Forces resulted in the recapture of the city of San Fernando, La Union. which resulted in the capture of San Fernando, La Union on March 23, 1945, and [[Bacnotan]], La Union and the military offensive throughout the province ended on March 24 after two months of fighting.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Battle of Bacsil Ridge - PVAO|url=https://pvao.gov.ph/events/battle-of-bacsil-ridge/|access-date=September 29, 2021|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Cityhood ===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
On May 14, 1996, the [[Sangguniang Bayan]] of San Fernando passed ''Resolution No. 20'', formally requesting the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] and [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] of the Philippines to convert the Municipality of San Fernando into a [[Component City]]. At that time, San Fernando had fulfilled the fundamental requirements for cityhood in accordance with the provisions of the ''[[Local Government Code of 1991]]''. According to a certification from the ''Bureau of Local Government Finance'', the municipality's average annual income for the calendar years 1994 and 1995, based on 1991 constant prices, was P 44,351,821.66. Additionally, the ''Land Management Bureau of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources'' certified that San Fernando covered a total land area of 10,526 hectares, exceeding the minimum requirement of 10,000 hectares.

Following a thorough review and careful assessment of the Sangguniang Bayan of San Fernando's petition, the [[Sangguniang Panlalawigan]] of La Union adopted Resolution No. 425-96, endorsing the cityhood bid to the House of Representatives and Congress.

House Bill 7594, titled ''"An Act Converting the Municipality of San Fernando, La Union into a Component City to be Known as the City of San Fernando,"'' was sponsored by ''Congressman Victor F. Ortega'' (1st District, La Union) and approved by the House of Representatives. The Senate subsequently approved the bill, sponsored by Senators Vicente Sotto III and Juan Flavier. On February 13, 1998, ''Republic Act 8509'' was signed into law by [[Fidel V. Ramos|President Fidel V. Ramos]]. Finally, on March 20, 1998, the residents of San Fernando overwhelmingly voted in favor of the law during a [[plebiscite]], fulfilling the long-held aspiration for San Fernando to attain cityhood.<ref name="ChanRobles-RA8509">{{cite web|title=Republic Act No. 8509 – An Act Converting the Municipality of San Fernando, La Union, Into a Component City To Be Known As the City of San Fernando|url=http://laws.chanrobles.com/republicacts/86_republicacts.php?id=8366|website=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library|access-date=October 4, 2016|date=February 13, 1998}}</ref>
