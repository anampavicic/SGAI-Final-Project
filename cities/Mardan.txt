Mardan is located in a region rich in archaeological sites.

The area around Mardan then formed part of the homeland of the [[Gandhara grave culture]] around 1800 BCE.

In July 2020, life size statues of the Buddha was found during construction activity in the Mardan area. However, local Muslim civilians from the area took it on their own hands to destroy these findings. The culprits also posted their vandalism on social media, which resulted on their arrest by the Pakistani authorities. The findings are part of the ancient Indian Buddhist past of the area and related to the [[Gandhara]] [[Mahajanapada]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nayadaur.tv/2020/07/4-arrested-for-destroying-ancient-buddha-statue-in-mardan/ |title = 4 Arrested For Destroying Ancient Buddha Statue In Mardan - Naya Daur| date=18 July 2020 }}</ref>
