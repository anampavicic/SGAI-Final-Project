'''eMbalenhle''' is a township in [[Govan Mbeki Local Municipality]] in the [[Mpumalanga]] province of South Africa.

It was established in the 1970s to serve as a black-only [[Township (South Africa)|township]] for the neighbouring [[Secunda, Mpumalanga|Secunda]], which was founded at the same time. Similar to Secunda, a substantial part of housing in eMbalenhle has been constructed by [[Sasol]] for its workers.<ref name=nrw>{{cite web|title=The Perverse Effects of Mixing Local Economic Development and Community Development: An Example from South Africa|url=http://www.meso-nrw.de/toolkit/case_studies/case-studies-case-9.html|publisher=Lernprojekt Meso-NRW|accessdate=7 January 2014}}</ref>

eMbalenhle is 10&nbsp;km away from Secunda, and either town is generally accessed from the other by means of using the [[R580 (South Africa)|R580]] road.
