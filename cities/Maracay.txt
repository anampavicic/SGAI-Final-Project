Most of it falls under the jurisdiction of [[Girardot Municipality, Aragua|Girardot Municipality]]. The population of Maracay and its surroundings in the 2011 census was 955,362. In Venezuela, Maracay is known as "Ciudad Jardín" ("Garden City").<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 5, 2018 |title=Maracay, la eterna Ciudad Jardín de Venezuela |url=https://www.el-carabobeno.com/maracay-la-eterna-ciudad-jardin-venezuela/ |website=www.el-carabobeno.com}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2022}}
[[File:Escultura de Juan Vicente Gómez.jpg|left|thumb|325x325px|Statue of [[Juan Vicente Gómez]] in Maracay]]
[[File:El Jaguar.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The jaguar, symbol of the Maracaya Indians]]
[[Image:Venus de tacarigua.jpg|thumb|right|''Venus de Tacarigua'', another symbol of Maracay]]

Officially established on March 5, 1701 by Bishop [[Diego de Baños y Sotomayor]] in the valleys of Tocopio and Tapatapa (what is known today as the central valley of Aragua) in northern Venezuela.

According to the most accepted explanation, it was named after a local indigenous chief, and refers to the "Maracayo" ('''Felis mitis'''), a small tiger. Alternative etymologies cite a local aromatic tree called '''Mara'''.

Maracay experienced rapid growth during [[Juan Vicente Gómez]]'s dictatorship (1908–1935). Gómez saw Maracay as a suitable place to make his residence during his rule, and ordered the construction of an Arc of Triumph, a bull plaza (a near replica of the one in [[Seville]], Spain), an Ópera house, a Zoo, and, most notably, the Hotel Jardín (Garden Hotel), a majestic, tourist attraction with very large gardens. The city is home to the Mausoleo de Gómez (Gómez's mausoleum), where the dictator is buried.
