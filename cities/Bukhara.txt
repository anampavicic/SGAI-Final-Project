People have inhabited the region around Bukhara for at least five millennia, and the city has existed for half that time. Located on the [[Silk Road]], the city has long served as a center of trade, scholarship, culture, and religion.

==Names==
The exact name of the city of Bukhara in ancient times is unknown. The whole [[Oasis of Bukhara|oasis]] was called Bukhara in ancient times, and probably only in the tenth century was it finally transferred to the city.<ref>Bukhara; Architectural epigraphy of Uzbekistan. p.28; Abdukhalikov F. Tashkent: UZBEKISTAN TODAY, 2016.</ref>

According to some scholars, the name dates back to the Sanskrit ''[[vihāra]]'' ([[Buddhist monastery]]).<ref name="Yusuf 2005 p. 55">{{cite book | last=Yusuf | first=P. S.

But, numerous Arabic, Persian, European and Chinese travellers and historians noted the place and Uzbekistan itself to be once populated by mostly Buddhists and few Zoroastrians. Indeed, the first Islamic text on Bukhara relates to the first Arab invader of Bukhara, Ubaidullah bin Ziad, who noted Bukhara to be a Buddhist country with Buddhist monasteries ruled by [[Khatun of Bukhara|a queen regent]] acting on behalf of her son.<ref name="Yusuf 2005 p. 55" /><ref name="Heirman Bumbacher 2007 p. 93">{{cite book | last1=Heirman | first1=A. | last2=Bumbacher | first2=S.P. | title=The Spread of Buddhism | publisher=Brill | series=Handbook of Oriental Studies.

According to other sources (such as ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]''), the name Bukhara is possibly derived from the [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] ''βuxārak'' ('Place of Good Fortune'), a name for Buddhist monasteries.<ref>Richard N Frye, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bukhara-i 'Bukhara i. In pre-Islamic times'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102200523/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v4f5/v4f5a028.html |date=January 2, 2009 }}, [[Encyclopædia Iranica]], 512.</ref><ref name="Nicholson 2018 p. 270"/>

In the [[Tang dynasty]], and other successive dynasties of Imperial China, Bukhara was known under the name of ''Bǔhē'' (捕喝),<ref name="umid">{{cite web| url=http://www.umid.uz/Main/Uzbekistan/General_Info/general_info.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010126042500/http://www.umid.uz/Main/Uzbekistan/General_Info/general_info.html| url-status=dead| archive-date=2001-01-26| title=General Info| author="UMID" Foundation, Uzbekistan| access-date=2007-10-04}}</ref> which has been replaced in Chinese by the modern generic phonetic spelling ''Bùhālā'' (布哈拉).

Between the 19th and 20th centuries, Bukhara was known as ''Bokhara'' in the English publications as exemplified by the writings and reports on the Emirate of Bukhara during [[the Great Game]].

[[Narshakhi|Muhammad ibn Jafar Narshakhi]] in his ''History of Bukhara'' (completed AD 943–44) mentions: {{blockquote|text=Bukhara has many names. One of its names was Numijkat. It has also been called "Bumiskat". It has 2 names in Arabic. One is "Madinat al Sufriya" meaning—"the copper city" and another is "Madinat Al Tujjar" meaning—"The city of Merchants". But, the name Bukhara is the original name and more known than all the other names. In [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], there is no other city with so many names.<ref>Narshaki, Richard Nelson Fyre, ''The History of Bukhara'', p. 27</ref>}}
Since the Middle Ages, the city has been known as ''Bukhārā'' / بخارا in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] sources. The modern [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] spelling is ''Buxoro''.

The city's name was mythologized as ''[[Albracca]]'' in the Italian epic poem ''[[Orlando Innamorato]],'' published in 1483 by [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]].<ref>''Orlando Innamorato'' translated by Charles Stanley Ross, Parlor Press LLC, 2004, p. 593. (Albraca is first mentioned in Book I, Canto VI, stanza 42, on p. 60.)</ref>

==History==
[[File:EucratidesStatere.jpg|thumb|upright|Coin belonging to the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] found in Bukhara]]
The [[history of Bukhara]] stretches back millennia. Along with [[Samarkand]], Bukhara was the epicentre of the [[Culture of Iran|Persian]] culture in medieval Asia until the fall of [[Timurid dynasty]].

[[File:M17 Abassides Sogdiane 2 (8011745146).jpg|upright=1.15 |thumb|Bukhara coinage of [[Abbasid]] caliph [[al-Mahdi]]. Bukhara was under [[Caliphate]] control [[Anarchy at Samarra|until AD 861]].]]
By 850, Bukhara served as the capital of the [[Samanid Empire]],{{sfn|Salama|El-Ashmouni|2021|p=84}} and was the birthplace of [[Imam Bukhari]]. The Samanids, claiming descent from [[Bahram Chobin]], rejuvenated [[Persian culture]] far from [[Baghdad]], the centre of the Islamic world. [[New Persian]] flourished in Bukhara and [[Rudaki]], the father of [[Persian literature|Persian poetry]], was born and raised in Bukhara and wrote his most famous poem about the beauty of the city. For this purpose, Bukhara had continuously served as the most important of cities in many [[Persianate]] empires, namely [[Samanids]], [[Karakhanid empire|Karakhanids]], [[Khwarazmian Empire|Khwarazmids]], and [[Timurids]].

The influence of Bukhara in the wider Islamic world started to diminish starting from the arrival of another Turkic dynasty of Uzbeks in the 16th Century. [[Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar]] was the last [[List of monarchs of Persia|Persian]] emperor who attempted to retake the city just before his assassination, and by the 19th century the city had become a peripheral city in the Persian and the Islamic world, being ruled by local [[Emirate of Bukhara|Emirs of Bukhara]], who were the last [[Persianate]] princes before the fall of the city to the [[red army]].

At the beginning of the 11th century, Bukhara became part of the Turkic state of the [[Karakhanids]]. The rulers of the Karakhanids built many buildings in Bukhara: the Kalyan minaret, the Magoki Attori mosque, palaces and parks.<ref>Nemtseva N. B. Rabat-i Malik, XI — nachalo XVIII vv.: arkheologicheskiye issledovaniya. — Tashkent: Frantsuzskiy Institut Issledovaniy Tsentral'noy Azii, 2009.</ref>

Bukhara lies west of Samarkand and was previously a focal point of learning eminent all through the Persian and the Islamic world. It is the old neighborhood of the incomparable Sheik [[Naqshbandi]]. He was a focal figure in the advancement of the mysterious Sufi way to deal with theory, religion and Islam.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bukhara|url=https://samarkandtours.com/uzbekistan/bukhara/|access-date=19 November 2020}}</ref>

It is now the [[Capital city|capital]] of [[Bukhara Region]] ([[Wilayah|viloyat]]) of [[Uzbekistan]]. Located on the [[Silk Road]], the city has long been a center of trade, scholarship, culture, and religion. During the golden age of the [[Samanid Empire|Samanids]], Bukhara became a major intellectual center of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]],{{sfn|Pickett|2020|p=46}} and was renowned for its numerous libraries.{{sfn|Marlow|2016|p=63}} The historic center of Bukhara, which contains numerous [[mosque]]s and [[madrassa]]s, has been listed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]].

For several centuries, the cities of Bukhara av Khiva were known as major centers of the slave trade, and the [[Bukhara slave trade]], alongside the neighboring [[Khivan slave trade|slave trade in Khiva]], has been referred to as the "slave capitals of the world".<ref>Mayers, K. (2016).

[[File:Fires in Bukhara 1920.jpg|thumb|left|Bukhara under siege by Red Army troops and burning, September 1, 1920]]
Bukhara was the last capital of the [[Emirate of Bukhara]] and was besieged by the Red Army during the [[Russian Civil War]]. During [[Bukhara operation (1920)|the Bukhara operation of 1920]], [[Red Army]] troops under the command of Bolshevik general [[Mikhail Frunze]] attacked the city of Bukhara. On 31 August 1920, the Emir [[Mohammed Alim Khan|Alim Khan]] fled to [[Dushanbe]] in Eastern Bukhara (later he escaped from Dushanbe to [[Kabul]] in [[Afghanistan]]). On 2 September 1920, after four days of fighting, the emir's [[citadel]] (the ''Ark'') was destroyed and the red flag was raised from the top of [[Po-i-Kalyan|Kalyan Minaret]]. On 14 September 1920, the All-Bukharan Revolutionary Committee was set up, headed by A. Mukhitdinov. The government—the Council of People's Nazirs (see ''[[nāẓir]]'')—was presided over by [[Fayzulla Xoʻjayev]].

The [[Bukharan People's Soviet Republic]] existed from 1920 to 1924 when the city was integrated into the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic]]. [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Fitzroy Maclean]], then a young diplomat in the British Embassy in Moscow, made a surreptitious visit to Bokhara in 1938, sight-seeing and sleeping in parks. In his memoir ''[[Eastern Approaches]]'', he judged it an "enchanted city" with buildings that rivalled "the finest architecture of the [[Italian Renaissance]]". In the latter half of the 20th century, the [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|war in Afghanistan]] and [[Tajikistani Civil War|civil war in Tajikistan]] brought [[Dari]]- and Tajik-speaking refugees into Bukhara and [[Samarkand]]. After integrating themselves into the local Tajik population, these cities face a movement for annexation into [[Tajikistan]] with which the cities have no common border.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Formation of the Uzbek Nation-State: A Study in Transition|first=Anita|last=Sengupta|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2003|pages=256–257}}</ref>

===Architectural complexes===
* '''[[Po-i-Kalyan]] Complex'''. The title '''Po-i Kalan''' or '''Poi Kalân''' ({{langx|fa|پای کلان}} 'Grand Foundation') belongs to the architectural complex located at the base of the great [[minaret]] Kalân.
*'''[[Kalyan minaret]]'''. More properly, Minâra-i Kalân (Persian/Tajik for 'Grand Minaret'). Also known as the Tower of Death, as according to legend it is the site where criminals were executed by being thrown off the top for centuries. The [[minaret]] is the most famed part of the ensemble, and dominates over historical center of the city. The role of the minaret is largely for traditional and decorative purposes—its dimension exceeds the bounds of the main function of the minaret, which is to provide a vantage point from which the muezzin can call out people to prayer. For this purpose it was enough to ascend to a roof of a mosque. This practice was common in initial years of Islam. The word ''minaret'' derives from the Arabic word منارة ''manāra'' ('lighthouse', or more literally 'a place where something burns'). The minarets of the region were possible adaptations of "fire-towers" or lighthouses of previous Zoroastrian eras.<ref name="Kalan">{{cite web| url=http://www.pagetour.org/bukhara/bu/Kalyan_Minaret.htm| title=Kalyan Minaret| author=Dmitriy Page| access-date=October 14, 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021181644/http://pagetour.org/bukhara/bu/Kalyan_Minaret.htm| archive-date=October 21, 2014| url-status=dead}}</ref> The architect, whose name was simply Bako, designed the minaret in the form of a circular-pillar brick tower, narrowing upwards. The diameter of the base is {{convert|9|m||abbr=off|sp=us}}, while at the top it is {{convert|6|m||abbr=on}}. The tower is {{convert|45.6|m||abbr=on}} high, and can be seen from vast distances over the flat plains of Central Asia. There is a brick spiral staircase that twists up inside around the pillar, leading to the landing in sixteen-arched rotunda and skylight, upon which is based a magnificently designed stalactite cornice (or "sharif").<ref>"Бухоро Bukhara Бухара" На узбекском, английском и русском языках.

*'''[[Kalan Mosque|Kalân Mosque]]''' (Masjid-i Kalân), arguably completed in 1514, is equal to the [[Bibi-Khanym Mosque]] in Samarkand in size. The mosque is able to accommodate twelve thousand people. Although Kalyan Mosque and Bibi-Khanym Mosque of Samarkand are of the same type of building, they are different in terms of art of building. Two hundred and eighty-eight monumental pylons serve as a support for the multi-domed roofing of the galleries encircling the courtyard of Kalyan Mosque. The longitudinal axis of the courtyard ends up with a portal to the main chamber (maksura) with a cruciform hall, topped with a massive blue cupola on a mosaic drum. The edifice keeps many architectural curiosities, for example, a hole in one of domes. Through this hole one can see foundation of Kalyan Minaret. Then moving back step by step, one can count all belts of brickwork of the minaret to the rotunda.<ref>"В.Г. Сааков Архитектурные шедевры Бухары.

*'''[[Mir-i Arab Madrassah]] (1535–1536)'''. The construction of Mir-i-Arab Madrasah (Miri Arab Madrasah) is ascribed to Sheikh Abdullah Yamani of Yemen—called Mir-i-Arab—the spiritual mentor of [[Ubaidullah Khan]] and his son Abdul-Aziz Khan. Ubaidullah-khan waged permanent successful war with Iran. At least three times his troops seized Herat. Each of such plundering raids on Iran was accompanied by capture of great many captives. They say that Ubaidullah-khan had invested money gained from redemption of more than three thousand Persian captives into construction of Mir-i-Arab Madrasah. Ubaidullah-khan was very religious. He had been nurtured in high respect for Islam in the spirit of Sufism. His father named him in honor of prominent sheikh of the 15th century Ubaidullah al-Ahrar (1404–1490), by origin from Tashkent Region. By the 1530s, when sovereigns erected splendid mausoleums for themselves and for their relatives, was over. Khans of [[Muhammad Shaybani|Shaibanid dynasty]] were standard-bearers of Koran traditions. The significance of religion was so great that even such famed khan as Ubaidullah was conveyed to earth close by his mentor in his madrasah. In the middle of the vault (gurhana) in Mir-i-Arab Madrasah is situated the wooden tomb of Ubaidullah-khan. At his head is wrapped in the moulds his mentor, Mir-i-Arab. Muhammad Kasim, mudarris (a senior teacher) of the madrasah (died in 1047 hijra) is also interred near by here. The portal of Miri Arab Madrasah is situated on one axis with the portal of the Kalyan Mosque. However, because of some lowering of the square to the east it was necessary to raise a little an edifice of the madrasah on a platform.<ref name="Mir-i-Arab">{{cite web| url=http://www.pagetour.org/bukhara/bu/Miri_Arab.htm| title=Mir-i-Arab| author=Dmitriy Page| access-date=October 20, 2014}}</ref>

*'''[[Lyab-i Hauz|Lab-i Hauz]] Complex''' (or ''Lab-e hauz'', {{langx|fa|لب حوض}}, meaning ''by the pond'') Ensemble (1568–1622) is the name of the area surrounding one of the few remaining ''hauz'', or pond, in the city of Bukhara. Several such ponds existed in Bukhara prior to [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule. The ponds acted as the city's principal source of water, but were also notorious for spreading disease, and thus were mostly filled in during the 1920s and 1930s by the Soviets. The Lab-i Hauz survived owing to its role as the centerpiece of an architectural ensemble dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries. The Lab-i Hauz ensemble consists of the 16th-century Kukeldash Madrasah,<ref name="pagetour1">{{cite web| url=http://www.pagetour.org/bukhara/bu/Kukeldash.htm| title=Kukeldash Madrasah| author=Dmitriy Page| access-date=2007-10-04}}</ref> the largest in the city, along the north side of the pond.<ref name="pagetour2">{{cite web| url=http://www.pagetour.org/bukhara/bu/Khanaka.htm| title=Nadir Divan-Begi Khanaka| author=Dmitriy Page| access-date=2007-10-04}}</ref> On the eastern and western sides of the pond are a 17th-century lodging-house for itinerant [[Sufism|Sufis]], and a 17th-century madrasah.<ref name="pagetour3">{{cite web| url=http://www.pagetour.org/bukhara/bu/Nadir_Divan_Begi.htm| title=Nadir Divan-Begi Madrasah| author=Dmitriy Page| access-date=2007-10-04}}</ref>

*'''[[Bahoutdin Architectural Complex]]''' is a necropolis commemorating [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari|Shaykh Baha-ud-Din or Bohoutdin]], the founder of [[Naqshbandi]] order. The complex includes the ''dahma'' (gravestone) of Bahoutdin, Khakim Kushbegi mosque, Muzaffarkan mosque, and Abdul-Lazizkhan khanqah. The site is listed on the UNESCO World Heritage Site tentative list on 18 January 2008.

*'''Bukhara Fortress, the Ark'''
{{main|Ark of Bukhara}}

===Mausoleums===
* '''[[Boboyi Poradoz Mausoleum]]'''
The Boboyi Poradoz Mausoleum ([[Uzbek language|Uzbek]]: Boboyi Poradoʻz maqbarasi) is a monument of architecture in [[Bukhara Region]]. The [[mausoleum]] was built in the 19th century and is located behind the Salakhona gate. Today the mausoleum is located opposite the Ibn Sina Library of Bukhara. The mausoleum is included in the National List of Objects of Material Cultural Heritage of [[Uzbekistan]] of Republican Importance.

*'''[[Chashma-Ayub Mausoleum]]'''
Chashma-Ayub, or ''[[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]]'s spring,'' is located near the Samani mausoleum. Its name is said to reflect a legend that states the prophet Job ("Ayub" in the [[Quran]]) visited this place and brought forth a spring of water by the blow of his staff on the ground. The water of this well is said to be exceptionally pure, and is regarded for its supposed "healing qualities." The current edifice at the site was constructed during the reign of [[Timur]], and features a Khwarazm-style conical dome that is otherwise uncommon in the region.

*'''[[Samanid Mausoleum|Ismail Samani mausoleum]]'''
The Ismail Samani mausoleum (between 9th and 10th centuries), is one of the most highly esteemed work of [[Central Asia]]n architecture. It was built in the 9th century (between 892 and 943) as the resting-place of [[Isma'il ibn Ahmad|Ismail Samani]]—the founder of the [[Samanid Empire|Samanid dynasty]], which was the last native Persian dynasty to rule the region in the 9th to 10th centuries, after the Samanids established virtual independence from the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in [[Baghdad]].

The site is unique for its architectural style which combines both Zoroastrian and Islamic motifs. The building's facade is covered in intricately decorated brick work, which features circular patterns reminiscent of the sun—a common image in Zoroastrian art from the region at that time which is reminiscent of the Zoroastrian god, Ahura Mazda, who is typically represented by fire and light. The building's shape is cuboid, and reminiscent of the Ka'aba in Makkah, while the domed roof is a typical feature of mosque architecture. The syncretic style of the shrine is reflective of the 9th and 10th centuries—a time when the region still had large populations of Zoroastrians who had begun to convert to Islam around that time.

The shrine is also regarded as one of the oldest monuments in the Bukhara region. At the time of [[Genghis Khan]]'s invasion, the shrine was said to have already been buried in mud from flooding. Thus, when the Mongol hordes reached Bukhara, the shrine was spared from their destruction.

The mausoleum of Pakistan's founding father, [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], known as the [[Mazar-e-Quaid]] in [[Karachi]], was modeled after the shrine.

===Mosques===
*'''[[Bolo Haouz Mosque]]'''
[[File:La_mosquée_Bolo-Khaouz_(Boukhara,_Ouzbékistan)_(5684790316).jpg|thumb|The [[Bolo Haouz Mosque]]]]
Built in 1712, on the opposite side of the citadel of Ark in Registan district, Bolo Haouz Mosque is inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage Site list along with the other parts of the historic city. It served as a Friday mosque during the time when the [[Bukhara Khanate|emir of Bukhara]] was being subjugated under the [[Bolshevik Russia]]n rule in the 1920s.

*'''[[Chor Minor|Char Minar]]'''
[[File:Chor_Minor.jpg|thumb|[[Chor Minor|Char Minar]]]]
Char Minor (alternatively spelled '''Chor Minor''', and also alternatively known as the '''Madrasah of Khalif Niyaz-kul''') is a building tucked away in a lane northeast of the Lyabi Hauz complex. The structure was built by Khalif Niyaz-kul, a wealthy Bukharan of Turkmen origin in the 19th century under the rule of the [[Khanate of Bukhara#Janids|Janid dynasty]].<ref name="ReferenceA">О.А.Сухарева КВАРТАЛЬНАЯ ОБЩИНА ПОЗДНЕФЕОДАЛЬНОГО ГОРОДА БУХАРЫ (в

редакция восточной литературы Москва 1976 {{in lang|ru}}</ref> The four-towered structure is sometimes mistaken for a gate to the madras that once existed behind the structure; however, the Char-Minar is actually a complex of buildings with two functions, ritual and shelter.

The main edifice is a mosque. In spite of its unusual outward shape, the building has a typical interior for a Central Asian mosque. Owing to the buildings cupola, the room has good acoustic properties and therefore takes on special significance of 'dhikr-hana'—a place for ritualized 'dhikr' ceremonies of [[Sufism|Sufi]], the liturgy of which often include recitation, singing, and instrumental music.

On either side of the central edifice are located dwelling rooms, some of which have collapsed, leaving only their foundations visible. Consequently, for full functioning of [[madrasah]] only of classroom and some utility rooms is lacking. However, it was common practice that so-called madrasahs had no lecture rooms or, even if they had, no lectures had been given in them. These madrasahs were employed as student hospices.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Each of the four towers has different decorational motifs. Some say that elements of decoration reflect the four religions known to Central Asians. One can find elements reminiscent of a cross, a [[Christianity|Christian]] fish motif, and a Buddhist praying-wheel, in addition to Zoroastrian and Islamic motifs.<ref name="pagetour4">{{cite web| url=http://www.pagetour.org/bukhara/bu/Char_Minar.htm| title=Char Minar Madrasah| author=Dmitriy Page| access-date=October 14, 2014}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> 
In 1995, due to an underground brook, one of the four towers collapsed<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/soc/2149 UNESCO World Heritage Centre - State of Conservation (SOC 1997) Historic Centre of Bukhara (Uzbekistan)]</ref> and emergency assistance was applied for and granted by [[UNESCO]] under the [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage Fund]]. Although the collapse resulted in destabilizing the entire structure, the authorities were anxious to keep awareness of the disaster to a minimum. Without explanation the building disappeared from the list of sights and after hurried reconstruction of the tower "using non-traditional building material, such as poor quality cement and steel"<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/soc/2149UNESCO World Heritage Centre - State of Conservation (SOC 1997) Historic Centre of Bukhara (Uzbekistan)]</ref> Char Minar returned as one of the most popular sights of the city, yet the event has been kept secret ever since.

On the esplanade to the right from Char-Minar is a pool, likely of the same age as the rest of the building complex. Char Minar is now surrounded mainly by small houses and shops along its perimeter.

*'''[[Magok-i-Attari Mosque]]'''
[[File:Magoki-Attari.JPG|thumb|The Magoki-Attari mosque (south façade)]]
The former Magoki Attori mosque was constructed in the 9th century on the remains of what may have been an older Zoroastrian temple. The mosque was destroyed and rebuilt more than once, and the oldest part now remaining is the south façade, which dates from the 12th century—making it one of the oldest surviving structures in Bukhara, and one of few which survived the onslaught of Genghis Khan. Lower than the surrounding ground level, the mosque was excavated in 1935. It no longer functions as a mosque, but, rather, houses a carpet museum.

*'''Mosque of Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani'''
In Bukhara there is a mosque which is said to be that of [[Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani]], the patron saint of Kashmiri Muslims in the [[Kashmir Valley|Valley of Kashmir]].<ref>Jaffer Badakshi in Khasatul Munakib reference by Jeelani Allaie</ref>

==Geography==
About {{convert|140|mi|km}} west of Samarkand in south-central Uzbekistan, Bukhara is located on the [[Zeravshan (river)|Zeravshan]] River, at an elevation of {{convert|751|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}.

=== Climate ===
Bukhara has a typically Central Asian [[desert climate#Cold desert climates|cool arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BWk''). The average maximum afternoon temperature in January is {{convert|6.6|°C|°F|1|disp=or}}, rising to an average maximum of around {{convert|37.2|°C|°F|1|disp=or}} in July. Mean annual precipitation is {{convert|135|mm|in|2|disp=or}}.

Water was important in the hot, dry climate of [[Central Asia]], so from ancient times, irrigation farming was developed. Cities were built near rivers, and water channels were built to serve the entire city. Uncovered reservoirs, known as ''hauzes'', were constructed. Special covered water reservoirs, or ''sardobas'', were built along caravan routes to supply travelers and their animals with water.

However, the heavy use of agrochemicals during the Soviet era, diversion of irrigation water from the two rivers that feed Uzbekistan, and the lack of water treatment plants have caused health and environmental problems on a large scale.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

The [[Turkmenistan]] border is about 80&nbsp;km away with the nearest city there being [[Türkmenabat]], connected via the [[M37 highway (Turkmenistan)|M37 highway]] which continues to other places in Turkmenistan including [[Ashgabat]]. The city is also served by railroad links with the rest of Uzbekistan, and is a hub for roadways leading to all major cities in Uzbekistan and beyond, including [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] in [[Afghanistan]] via the [[M39 highway (Uzbekistan)|M39 highway]]. The city of [[Samarkand]] is 215&nbsp;km to the east of Bukhara.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Transport in, out and around Bukhara |url=https://caravanistan.com/uzbekistan/center/bukhara/transport/ |access-date=2021-03-15|website=Caravanistan|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Internal transportation facilities===

Bukhara city is the largest transport hub after Tashkent in Uzbekistan. Inside the city there is facility of bus transportation. There are over 45 bus lines. Majority of them have been equipped with ISUZU buses but some buses are being brought from China. By the number of buses and bus routes facilities Bukhara is the largest after Tashkent in Uzbekistan.

==Demographics==
[[File:Boukhara 4654a.jpg|thumb|left|Uzbekistan, Bukhara, Spices and silk festival]]
Bukhara recorded a population of 279,200 in 2019. Bukhara (along with Samarkand) is one of the two major centers of Uzbekistan's Tajik minority. Bukhara was also home to the [[Bukharan Jews]], whose ancestors settled in the city during Roman times. Most Bukharian Jews left Bukhara between 1925 and 2000.

[[Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda]] defines the name Bukhara itself as meaning "full of knowledge", referring to the fact that in antiquity, Bukhara was a scientific and scholarship powerhouse.
In the Italian romantic [[Epic poetry|epic]] ''[[Orlando innamorato]]'' by [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]], Bukhara is called [[Albracca]] and described as a major city of [[Cathay]]. There, within its walled city and fortress, [[Angelica (character)|Angelica]] and the knights she has befriended make their stand when attacked by [[Agrican]], emperor of [[Tartary]]. As described, this siege by Agrican resembles the historic siege by [[Genghis Khan]] in 1220.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Boiardo |first=Matteo Maria|last2=Ross|first2=Charles Stanley |title=Orlando innamorato|date=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-282438-4|location=Oxford|oclc=32277275}}</ref>
