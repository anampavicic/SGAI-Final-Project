*231: Wild rice ({{lang|zh|野稻}}) of Jiaxing informed [[Sun Quan]] of the [[Eastern Wu|Kingdom of Wu]] that there was a sign of auspice, so Sun changed Youchuan to Hexing District ({{lang|zh-hant|禾興縣}}). This why Jiaxing's abbreviation is ''He''. Sun also changed his [[Chinese era name|era name]] to Jiahe ({{lang|zh|嘉禾}}) in the following year.
*January 242: [[Sun He (Zixiao)|Sun He]] was made the [[crown prince]]. Because of the [[naming taboo]], Jiahe was changed to Jiaxing.

*938: (Later Jin of the [[Five Dynasties]]): Xiu Prefecture ({{lang|zh|秀州}}) established
*1117: ([[Song dynasty]]): Jiahe District ({{lang|zh|嘉禾郡}})
*1429: ([[Ming dynasty]]): Xiushui District ({{lang|zh-hant|秀水縣}}) was established northwest of Jiaxing.
*Early 1900s (the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]): Xiushui and Jiaxing were combined into Jiahe [[Counties of the People's Republic of China#History|County]]
*1914: Reverted to Jiaxing County (because there's a [[Jiahe County|Jiahe]] in [[Hunan]])
*1921: [[Chinese Communist Party]] founded at the [[South Lake, Jiaxing|South Lake]] in Jiaxing.
*1926: Following the defection of Zhejiang civil governor [[Xia Chao]] to the [[Kuomintang]] during the [[Northern Expedition]], the army of warlord [[Sun Chuanfang]] completely defeats Xia's largely untrained army at Jiaxing. Xia is captured and executed shortly thereafter.{{sfnp|Jordan|1976|p=91}}{{sfnp|Smith|2000|p=149}}
*1949 − 1958, 1979 ([[People's Republic of China|PRC]]): Upgraded to a city{{clarify|date=November 2012}}

==Economy==

Industry is the main economic driver to the city's economy, contributing 47% to its GDP in 2015. Jiaxing is also well known as the 'hometown of [[silk]]', hence it is a famous producer of [[textile]]s and woolens.  It is one of the world's largest exporters of [[leather]] goods.  There are mechanical, chemical and electronic industries there.

Jiaxing is an important energy base in East China. [[Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant]], the first self-designed nuclear power station in China, and [[Fangjiashan Nuclear Power Plant]] (under construction) are located in Haiyan County.

===Jiaxing Export Processing Zone===

Established in 2003, Jiaxing Export Processing Zone is a state-level export processing zone approved by State Council. It has a built-up area of 2.98&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Its development goal is to become the export processing base for IT, IC, mechanical and electrical, electronics and other high-tech industries.<ref>{{cite web |last=JiaXing Government |first=JiaXing Government |date=2015-02-15 |title="升级版"嘉兴出口加工区呼之欲出 |url=https://www.jiaxing.gov.cn/art/2015/2/15/art_1228921205_41030082.html |website=中共嘉兴市委 嘉兴市人民政府}}</ref>

==Tourism==
[[File:子城正门.jpg|thumb|The main gate of the ''Zicheng'', lit. "citadel", of Jiaxing]]

'''[[South Lake, Jiaxing|South Lake]]''', to the south-east of the old walled city, has been a popular tourist site for centuries. The [[Chinese Communist Party]] was officially founded on a boat in the lake, after the delegates to its first congress adjourned their meeting in Shanghai and reconvened here. As a result, the lake is now a popular destination for Communist Party "education" tours.

Within the city proper, the '''Zicheng''' (citadel) of Jiaxing was for two millennia the fortified nucleus of the walled city, though only fragmented remains now survive from the imeprial era. The main gate was rebuilt in 1990. Jiaxing is one of the very few cities in south-east China that retains any vestige of a citadel. A number of famous writers' homes also survive in the old walled city, as well as a Carmelite abbey and Gothic abbey church built in 1902.

'''Meiwan Street''' and '''Yuehe Street''' (Zhongji Road and surrounds) are two restored neighbourhoods to the south and north of the old city respectively, located near the city moat, canals and lakes. Literally "''Prunus'' bay street" and "moon river street" respectively, these two neighbourhoods combine restored historic buildings and newly landscaped gardens. Meiwan Street features buildings in the style of private residences of prominent families, and is the location of ''[[Kim Gu|Kim Koo]]'s refuge'', a house significant in the history of the Korean independence movement, and a family shrine of the Qian family, a prominent local family. By contrast, Yuehe Street features artisan workshops and street food stores. In January 2022, Yuehe Street was named the "first provincial night cultural and tourist concentration area".

'''[[Wuzhen]]''' and '''[[Xitang]]''', two townships within Jiaxing city limits, feature preserved and restored houses situated along small canals that are evocative of typical canal towns of the region. They are popular tourist destinations and filming locations.
