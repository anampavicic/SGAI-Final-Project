''Bacólod'' ({{langx|en|Bacolod}}), is derived from ''[[Filipino orthography#Adoption of the Latin script|bakólod]]'' ([[Filipino orthography#Adoption of the Latin script|Old Spelling]]: ''bacólod''), the [[Hiligaynon language|Old Hiligaynon (Old Ilonggo)]] ([[Filipino orthography#Adoption of the Latin script|Old Spelling]]: ''Ylongo and Ilongo'') word for a "hill, turtle, mound, rise, hillock, down, any small eminence or elevation",<ref>{{cite web | title =VISAYAN-ENGLISH DICTIONARY (KAPULÚNGAN BINISAYÁ-ININGLÍS) | url=http://www.gutenberg.ph/previews/kaufmann/KVED-Body.pdf | access-date = June 15, 2010}}</ref> since the resettlement was founded on a stony, hilly area, now the [[barangay]] of Granada.<ref>{{cite web| title= The Official Website of Bacolod City| url= http://www.bacolodcity.gov.ph/bacolod_city.htm| access-date= May 3, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100427021151/http://www.bacolodcity.gov.ph/bacolod_city.htm| archive-date= April 27, 2010| url-status= dead}}</ref> It was officially called ''Ciudad de Bacólod'' (City of Bacolod) when ''Municipalidad de Bacólod'' (Municipality of Bacolod) was converted into a city in 1938.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Spanish colonial period===
Historical church accounts provide a glimpse of the early years of Bacolod as a mere small [[Human settlement|settlement]] by the riverbank known as ''Magsungay'' (translated as "horn-shaped" in English). When the neighboring settlement of [[Bago, Negros Occidental|Bago]] was elevated into the status of a small town in 1575,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ilongo.weebly.com/iloilo-history-part-1.html |title=Iloilo History Part 1 - Research Center for Iloilo |access-date=June 29, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304201139/http://ilongo.weebly.com/iloilo-history-part-1.html |archive-date=March 4, 2016 }}</ref> it had several religious dependencies and one of which was the village of Magsungay. The early missionaries placed the village under the care and protection of [[Saint Sebastian]] sometime in the middle of the 18th century. A ''corregidor'' ({{langx|en|[[magistrate]]}}) by the name of Luis Fernando de Luna, donated a relic of the saint for the growing [[Catholic missions|mission]], and since then, the village came to be known as ''San Sebastián de Magsung̃ay''.<ref name="ep">{{cite web|title=BACOLOD, The City of Smiles |url=http://www.experiencephilippines.ph/LM/news/id-1207204337611.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802073041/http://www.experiencephilippines.ph/LM/news/id-1207204337611.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 2, 2009 |access-date=May 3, 2010 }}</ref>

Bacolod was not established as a town until 1755 or 1756, after the inhabitants of the coastal settlement of ''San Sebastián de Magsung̃ay'', were attacked by [[Moro people|forces]] under [[Datu]] [[List of sultans of Sulu|Bantílan]] of [[Sulu Province|Sulu]] on July 14, 1755, and the villagers transferred from the coast to a hilly area called ''Bacólod'' (which is now the barangay of Granada). Bernardino de los Santos became the first ''[[gobernadorcillo]]'' ({{langx|en|municipal judge or governor}}). The town of Bacolod was constituted as a ''parroquia'' ({{langx|en|[[parish]]}}) in 1788 under the [[secular clergy]], but did not have a resident [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] until 1802, as the town was served by the priest from [[Bago, Negros Occidental|Bago]], and later [[Binalbagan, Negros Occidental|Binalbagan]]. By 1790, slave raids on Bacolod by [[Moro people|Moro]] [[Piracy|pirates]] had ceased.<ref name="admu2">{{cite web|title=Negros, the Island that Sugar Built |url=http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/negros.html |access-date=May 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811023259/http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/negros.html |archive-date=August 11, 2010 }}</ref>

In 1846, upon the request of Romualdo Jimeno, [[bishop]] of [[Cebu]] and [[Negros (Philippines)|Negros]] at that time, [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Narciso Clavería y Zaldúa]] sent to Negros a team of [[Order of Augustinian Recollects|Recollect]] missionaries headed by priest Fernando Cuenca.<ref name="ep"/> A decree of June 20, 1848, by ''Gobernador General'' Clavería ordered the restructuring of Negros politically and religiously.

Transfer of Bacolod to the Recollects, however, took place only in 1871.<ref name="admu2"/> ''Fray'' Mauricio Ferrero became the first Augustinian Recollect parish priest of Bacolod and successor to the [[Secular clergy|secular priest]], Fr.

In 1889, Bacolod became the capital of ''Occidental Negros'' when the province of Negros was politically divided into the separate provinces of ''Occidental Negros'' ([[Philippine Spanish|Spanish]]: ''Negros Occidental'') and ''Oriental Negros'' ([[Philippine Spanish|Spanish]]: ''[[Negros Oriental]]'').

[[File:Negros Revolution surrender document.jpg|right|thumb|Last page of the ''Acta de Capitulación'' ({{langx|en|[[Surrender (military)|Surrender Document]]}}).]]
The success of the uprising in Bacolod and environs was attributed to the low morale of the local imperial Spanish detachment, due to its defeat in [[Panay]] and [[Luzon]] and to the psychological warfare waged by Generals [[Aniceto Lacson]] and [[Juan Araneta]]. In 1897, a battle in Bacolod was fought at Matab-ang River. A year later, on November 5, 1898, the ''Negrense Revolucionarios'' ({{langx|en|Negrense Revolutionary Army}}), armed with knives, [[Bolo knife|bolos]], spears, and rifle-like [[Nypa fruticans|nipa palm]] stems, and pieces of ''[[sawali]]'' or ''amakan'' mounted on carts, captured the convent, presently ''Palacio Episcopal'' ({{langx|en|Bishop's Palace}}), where Colonel Isidro de Castro y Cisneros, well-armed ''cazadores'' ({{langx|en|hunters}}) and [[platoon]]s of ''Guardias Civiles'' ({{langx|en|[[Civil Guard (Spain)#Peacekeepers|Civil Guards]]}}), surrendered.

On November 7, 1898, most of the revolutionary army gathered together to establish a provisional junta and to confirm the elections of [[Aniceto Lacson]] as president, [[Juan Araneta]] as war-delegate, as well as the other officials. For a brief moment, the provinces of ''Occidental Negros'' and ''Oriental Negros'' were reunited under the cantonal government of the ''Negrense Revolucionarios'', from November 6, 1898, to the end of February 1899, making Bacolod the capital. In March 1899, the [[United States armed forces|American forces]] led by [[Colonel]] James G. Smith occupied Bacolod, the revolutionary capital of ''República Cantonal de Negros'' ({{langx|en|Cantonal Republic of Negros}}). They occupied Bacolod after the invitation of the [[Republic of Negros]] which sought protectorate status for their nation under the United States.

===Japanese occupation and allied liberation===
In [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|World War II]], Bacolod was occupied by the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese forces]] on May 21, 1942.<ref>{{cite book |last1=National Historical Institute (Philippines) |last2=Philippine National Historical Society |title=History from the People: Aklan, Antique, Capiz, Iloilo, Negros Occidental, Negros Oriental and Guimaras |date=1999 |publisher=National Historical Institute and Philippine National Historical Society |isbn=9789715381345 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xCFwAAAAMAAJ |access-date=October 15, 2019 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="SymbolsOfTheState">{{cite book |last1=Philippines Bureau of Local Government |title=Symbols of the State: Republic of the Philippines |date=1975 |publisher=Bureau of Local Government, Department of Local Government and Community Development |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N6MbAQAAMAAJ |access-date=October 15, 2019 |language=en}}</ref> Lieutenant General Kawano "Kono" Takeshi, the Japanese [[Organization of Japanese forces in Southeast Asia#Organization of Japanese forces in Philippines|commanding officer]] of the 77th Infantry Brigade, 102nd Division, seized the homes of [[Don (honorific)|Don]] Generoso Villanueva, a prominent sugar planter—whose home, the [[Daku Balay]] served as the "seat of power" (occupational headquarters for the Japanese Forces in Negros and all of the Central Visayan region of the Philippines) and being the tallest building of Bacolod it served as the city's watchtower—and the home of his brother-in-law, Don Mariano Ramos, the first appointed [[Municipal President]] of Bacolod. The home of Don Generoso was lived in by Lt. General Takeshi throughout the duration of the war and also served as his office and the home of Don Mariano was occupied by a Japanese Colonel serving under the command of Lt. General Takeshi. The city was liberated by joint [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|Philippine]] and American forces on May 29, 1945. It took time to rebuild the city after liberation. However, upon the orders of Lt. General Takeshi, both the homes of Villanueva and Ramos were saved from destruction by the retreating Japanese forces.

In March 1945, upon the invasion of the American and Philippine Commonwealth forces, the withdrawal of the Japanese army into the mountains and the temporary occupation of Bacolod by the combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth armed forces, the house of Villanueva was then occupied by Major General Rapp Brush,<ref name="SymbolsOfTheState" /> commander of the 40th Infantry Division, known as the "Sun Burst" Division, for approximately five months. The local Philippine military built and established the general headquarters and camp bases of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] which was active from January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946. The 7th Constabulary Regiment of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] was also active from October 28, 1944, to June 30, 1946, and was stationed in Bacolod during and after World War II.

When the country finally gained [[Republic Day (Philippines)|independence]] from the United States, the city's public markets and slaughterhouses were rebuilt during the administration of then Mayor Vicente Remitió from 1947 to 1949. In 1948, a fire razed a portion of the records section of the old city hall that consumed the rear end of the building and with it, numerous priceless documents of the city.<ref>{{cite web | title =THE BACOLOD CITY HALL STORY | url =http://www.bacolodcity.gov.ph/cityhallstory.htm | access-date =June 14, 2010 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20110408141508/http://www.bacolodcity.gov.ph/cityhallstory.htm | archive-date =April 8, 2011 | url-status =dead }}</ref>

Bacolod was classified as a highly urbanized city on September 27, 1984, by the provision of Section 166 and 168 of
the Local Government Code and the DILG Memo Circular No. 83-49.

In January 1985, the original hardwood and coral structure of ''Palacio Episcopal'' was almost entirely destroyed by a fire.
