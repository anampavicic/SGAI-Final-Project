Once a mid-sized coastal village, Nouakchott was selected as the capital for the nascent nation of Mauritania, with construction beginning in 1958. It was originally designed to accommodate a population of 15,000, but experienced significant population growth in the 1970s when many Mauritanians fled their home villages due to [[drought]] and increasing [[desertification]]. Many of the newcomers settled in [[slum]] areas of the city that were poorly maintained and extremely overcrowded. By the mid-1980s, Nouakchott's population was estimated to be between 400,000 to 500,000.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Handloff |first=Robert E. |title=Mauritania: A Country Study |publisher=Federal Research Division |year=1990 |isbn=9780160197970 |pages=50}}</ref>

{{As of|2023}}, the city had a population of nearly 1.5 million people and serves as the hub of the Mauritanian economy. It is home to a [[Port|deepwater port]] and [[Nouakchott–Oumtounsy International Airport]], one of the country's two international airports. It also hosts the [[University of Nouakchott Al Aasriya|University of Nouakchott]] and several other more specialized institutions of higher learning.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Nouakchott}}
Not too long ago, Nouakchott was known for being a small fishing town,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eros.usgs.gov/earthshots/nouakchott-mauritania|title=Nouakchott, Mauritania &#124; EROS}}</ref> fortified fishing village (''ksar'') in pre-colonial times and under [[French West Africa|French rule]]. As Mauritania prepared for independence, it lacked a capital city. The area of present-day Nouakchott was chosen by [[Moktar Ould Daddah]], the first President of Mauritania, and his advisors. Ould Daddah desired the new capital to symbolize modernity and national unity, which ruled out existing cities or towns in the interior. The village was selected as the capital city for its central location between [[Saint-Louis, Senegal]], the city from which the colony of Mauritania was governed, and [[Nouadhibou]]. Its location also meant that it avoided the sensitive issue of whether the capital was built in an area dominated by the [[Arabs]], [[Berbers|Amazigh]] (Berbers) or [[Black people|Sub-Saharan Africans]].<ref name="Pazzanita2008">{{cite book|author=Pazzanita, Anthony G. |title=Historical Dictionary of Mauritania|year=2008|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=978-0-8108-6265-4}}</ref>{{rp|369}}

Construction began in March 1958 to enlarge the village to house a population of 15,000, in 1959 Nouakchott started with its founding by indigenous people from the surrounding region,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/nouakchott-mauritania-1960/#:~:text=Nonetheless%20the%20city%20is%20the,was%20a%20small%20fishing%20village. | title=Nouakchott, Mauritania (1659- ) • | date=3 September 2014 }}</ref> and the basics were completed by the time that the French granted independence on 28 November 1960.<ref>Britannica,
[https://www.britannica.com/place/ Nouakchott Nouakchott], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019,</ref> Nouakchott was planned with the expectation that commerce and other economic activities would not take place in the city. Nouakchott's [[central business district]] was planned with broad streets and a grid-like structure; the new ''Cinquième Quartier'' (Fifth District) was located close to this area and became the location of a large open-air market and residential area within a few years. During the 1960s, the city obtained its own local government. By the 1970s, these new areas had grown so much that they replaced the old ''ksar'' in terms of importance, as they also hosted the governmental buildings and state enterprises.<ref name="Pazzanita2008"/>{{rp|369}}

The city was attacked twice in 1976 by the [[Polisario Front]] during the [[Western Sahara conflict]], but the guerrillas caused little damage. The city has had massive and unconstrained growth, driven by the North African [[drought]], since the beginning of the 1970s; hundreds of thousands moved there in search of a better life. The official censuses showed 134,000 residents in 1977 and 393,325 in 1988, although both figures were probably smaller than reality.<ref name="Pazzanita2008"/>{{rp|370}} The population is now estimated to consist of at least one third of the country's population of 3.3 million,<ref name=world66>{{cite web|title=Nouakchott Travel Guide|url=http://www.world66.com/africa/mauritania/nouakchott|website=www.world66.com|access-date=19 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619084512/http://www.world66.com/africa/mauritania/nouakchott|archive-date=19 June 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the 2013 census showed a population of 958,399.<ref name=census>{{cite web|title=Mauritania: Regions, Cities & Urban Localities - Population Statistics in Maps and Charts|url=https://citypopulation.de/Mauritania-Cities.html|website=citypopulation.de|access-date=19 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026070503/http://www.citypopulation.de/Mauritania-Cities.html|archive-date=26 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Nouakchott is built around a large tree-lined street, Avenue Gamal Abdel Nasser, which runs northeast through the city centre from the airport. It divides the city into two, with the residential areas in the north and the [[medina quarter]], along with the ''kebbe'', a shanty town formed due to the displacement of people from other areas by the desert.<ref name=valic>{{cite book|last1=de Valicourt|first1=Benedict|title=Mauritanie|date=2000|publisher=Editions Marcus|location=Paris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Z6asvXDSPcC&q=avenue+gamal+abdel+nasser+nouakchott&pg=PA52|isbn=9782713101533}}</ref>{{rp|50–57}} Other major streets are named (in [[French language|French]]) for notable Mauritanian or international figures of the 1960s: Avenue Gamal Abdel Nasser, Avenue Charles de Gaulle, Avenue Kennedy, and Avenue Lumumba, for example.<ref name="roughguide"/>

The ''kebbe'' consists of [[cement]] buildings that are built overnight and made to look permanent to avoid destruction by the authorities. In 1999, it was estimated that more than half of the city's inhabitants lived in tents and shacks, which were used for residential as well as business purposes.<ref name=lawrence/> The city is broken into nine ''arrondissements'', sub-divided into alphabetized ''Îlots''. These are Teyarett, Ksar, Tevragh-Zeïna, Toujounine, Sebkha, El Mina, Dar-Naïm, Arafat and Riad. The Sebkha (Cinquième) Arrondissement is home to a large shopping area.<ref name="roughguide">{{cite book|last1=Hudgens|first1=Jim|last2=Trillo|first2=Richard|title=Rough Guide to West Africa|date=2003|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1843531186|edition=4th|url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetowest0000hudg}}</ref>{{rp|116−17}}

===Climate===
Nouakchott features a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: BWh) with hot temperatures throughout the year but cool winter night temperatures. Due to the city's oceanside location, Nouakchott is generally not quite as hot as other cities with this climate. Still, the city can experience sweltering days. While average high temperatures are relatively constant at around {{convert|33|C|abbr=on|0}}, average low temperatures can range from {{convert|25|C|abbr=on|0}} during the fall months (in this city fall is hotter than summer, with September and October being the hottest months) to {{convert|13|C|abbr=on|0}} during the winter months. Minimum temperatures can be as low as {{convert|10|C|abbr=on|0}} during winter nights in Nouakchott. Average rainfall in the city is {{convert|95|mm|in|abbr=on}} a year.<ref name=DWD/>

==Government==
[[File:15-Nouakchott-eH-R0058185.jpg|thumb|A partial view of the city]]

Nouakchott is divided into three administrative [[regions of Mauritania|regions]] (''wilayat'') led by governors appointed by the central government, each of which contains three [[departments of Mauritania|departments]] (''moughataa''):

* '''[[Nouakchott-Nord Region|Nouakchott-Nord]]''' (Nouakchott-North): [[Dar-Naim]], [[Teyarett]], [[Toujouonine]] 
* '''[[Nouakchott-Ouest Region|Nouakchott-Ouest]]''' (Nouakchott-West): [[Ksar, Mauritania|Ksar]], [[Sebkha, Mauritania|Sebkha]], [[Tevragh-Zeina]] 
* '''[[Nouakchott-Sud Region|Nouakchott-Sud]]''' (Nouakchott-South): [[Arafat, Mauritania|Arafat]], [[El Mina, Mauritania|El Mina]], [[Riyad, Mauritania|Riyad]]

Separate from the ''wilayat'', a directly elected [[Regional Council of Nouakchott|regional council]] was established in Nouakchott in 2018, which took over the roles of promoting social and economic development from the [[Urban Community of Nouakchott|Urban Community]] that it replaced. [[Fatimatou Abdel Malick]] was elected Council president in September 2018, and re-elected in May 2023.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regions-francophones.org/actualite/2438/5606-la-region-de-nouakchott.htm | title=La Région de Nouakchott |language=fr |publisher={{ill|International Association of Francophone Regions|fr|Association internationale des régions francophones}} |date=1 July 2020 |access-date=25 January 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=MyCeni - Résultats 2023 |url=https://res-myceni.org/#/ |access-date=2024-02-20 |website=res-myceni.org}}</ref>

Nouakchott was initially divided into four departments in 1973. In 1986 the current nine departments were created.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ami.mr/fr/bulletin20010701.htm |title=Actualité du dimanche 01juillet 2001 |publisher=Ami.mr |access-date=2009-07-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011606/http://www.ami.mr/fr/bulletin20010701.htm |archive-date=28 September 2007 }}</ref>

For comparison, its population was only 20,000 in 1969. Part of the difficulty in estimating the city's population is that part of it is [[nomad]]ic, setting up tents in suitable locations, then packing up when the need strikes. Some estimates put the 2008 population at over 2 million.<ref name="world66" /> The 2013 census gave the city's population as 958,399.<ref name="census" />

===Slum resettlement===
In 2009, the government of Mauritania announced that it would begin a process of clearing the slum on the outskirts of Nouakchott, as 24,000 families would eventually be relocated to planned housing in the city. The process was scheduled to begin with the relocation of 9,000 families from the outskirts into the poor [[Arafat, Mauritania|Arafat department]] neighborhood of "Kosovo", popularly named for its high crime rate and poor services.{{citation needed|date=April 2024}} The government planned to begin moving families in June 2009, despite concerns from aid agencies that needed infrastructure could not be put in place in the receiving neighborhood.<ref>{{cite web|title=City versus slum|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportID=83724|website=IRIN|access-date=19 November 2016|date=31 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613015533/http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportID=83724|archive-date=13 June 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>
