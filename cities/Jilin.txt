Its capital and largest city is [[Changchun]]. Jilin borders [[North Korea]] ([[Rasŏn]], [[North Hamgyong]], [[Ryanggang]] and [[Chagang]]) and [[Russia]] ([[Primorsky Krai]]) to the east, [[Heilongjiang]] to the north, [[Liaoning]] to the south, and [[Inner Mongolia]] to the west. Along with the rest of [[Northeast China]], Jilin underwent an early period of industrialization. However, Jilin's economy, characterized by [[heavy industry]], has been facing economic difficulties with [[privatization]]. This prompted the central government to undertake a campaign called "[[Revitalize the Northeast]]". The region contains large deposits of [[oil shale]].

==Name==
{{anchor|etymology}}
The name "Jilin" originates from ''girin ula'',{{efn|([[File:girin ula.jpg|60px]]) {{MongolUnicode|ᡤᡳᡵᡳᠨ}} {{MongolUnicode|ᡠᠯᠠ}}}} a [[Manchu language|Manchu]] phrase meaning "along the river", shortened to Kirin in English.

== History ==
{{main|History of Jilin}}
In ancient times, Jilin was inhabited by the [[Xianbei]], [[Sushen]], the [[Mohe people|Mohe]], [[Jurchens]], and the [[Wuji (people)|Wùjí]] ({{lang|zh|勿吉}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jlplib.com.cn/szzy/jlsbnjs/200911/P020091124579925151035.pdf |script-title=zh:前言 |publisher=Jilin Province Librrary |date=2009-11-24 |language=zh-cn }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The kingdoms of [[Buyeo kingdom|Buyeo]] and [[Goguryeo]] ruled parts of this area.

The region then fell successively under the domination of the [[Xiongnu]], [[Xianbei state]], [[Goguryeo]], [[Balhae]], [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao Dynasty]], the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jurchen]] [[Jin Dynasty, 1115–1234|Jin Dynasty]], and the [[Mongol]] [[Yuan dynasty]].<ref name=":0">''History of Mongolia'', Volume II, 2003</ref> During the [[Qing Dynasty]], much of the area was under the control of the General of Jilin (Girin i Jiyanggiyūn), whose area of control extended to encompass much of what is [[Russia]]'s [[Primorsky Krai]] today.

After the [[Primorsky Krai]] area was ceded to Russia in 1860, the government began to open the area up to Han Chinese migrants, most of whom came from [[Shandong]]. By the beginning of the 20th century, Han Chinese had become the dominant ethnic group of the region. In 1932, the area was incorporated into [[Manchukuo]], a [[puppet state]] set up by [[Japan]]. [[Changchun]] (then called Xinjing), capital of Jilin today, was made the capital of Manchukuo. After the defeat of [[Japan]] in 1945, the Red Army captured Jilin after Operation [[August Storm]].<ref name="Glantz">LTC David M.

[[Manchuria]] was the staging ground from which the communists eventually conquered the rest of China in the [[Chinese Civil War#Post-war power struggle (1945–1947)|Chinese Civil War]].

In 1949, Jilin province was smaller, encompassing only the environs of Changchun and [[Jilin City]], and the capital was at Jilin City, while Changchun was a municipality independent from the province. In the 1950s, Jilin was expanded to its present borders. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], Jilin was expanded again to include a part of [[Inner Mongolia]], giving it a border with the independent state of [[Mongolia]], though this was later reversed.

In recent times Jilin has, with the rest of [[heavy industry]]-based [[Northeast China]], been facing economic difficulties with [[privatization]]. This prompted the central government to undertake a campaign called "[[Revitalize the Northeast]]".

== Geography ==
Jilin lies in the central part of northeastern China, bordering [[Russia]] and [[North Korea]] in the east and southeast respectively. Jilin has an area of {{convert|190,000|km2|abbr=on}} and a population of 24 million. Its capital is [[Changchun]], which lies {{convert|113|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Jilin City]]. Jilin is rich in natural mineral deposits with 136 types of minerals, of which 70 have been extracted. Jilin has an abundance of [[Traditional Chinese medicine]] resources, with approximately 27,000 kinds of wild plants and 9,000 kinds of medicinal herbs.<ref name="China Expat City Guide: Jilin">{{cite web|title=China Expat city Guide Jilin|url=http://www.chinaexpat.com/city/jilin-city |publisher=China Expat |year=2008|access-date=2009-02-08}}</ref>

The province is rich in large reserves of oil, gas, coal, iron, nickel, [[molybdenum]], talc, graphite, gypsum, cement rock, gold and silver; its reserves of [[oil shale]] are the largest in the country.<ref name=ChinaBriefing2007>{{cite web|title=China Briefing Business Reports |url=http://shopping.china-briefing.com/index_eproduct_view.php?products_id=21 |publisher=Asia Briefing |year=2007 |access-date=2009-02-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220033255/http://shopping.china-briefing.com/index_eproduct_view.php?products_id=21 |archive-date=20 December 2008 }}</ref>
