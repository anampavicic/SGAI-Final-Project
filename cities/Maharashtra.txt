Notable dynasties that ruled the region include the [[Asmaka]]s, the [[Maurya]]s, the [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahanas]], the [[Western Satraps]], the [[Abhira dynasty|Abhiras]], the [[Vakataka dynasty|Vakatakas]], the [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]], the [[Rashtrakutas]], the [[Western Chalukya Empire|Western Chalukyas]], the [[Seuna (Yadava) dynasty|Seuna Yadavas]], the [[Khalji dynasty|Khaljis]], the [[Tughlaq dynasty|Tughlaqs]], the [[Bahmani Sultanate|Bahamanis]] and the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]]. In the early nineteenth century, the region was divided between the Dominions of the [[Peshwa]] in the [[Maratha Confederacy]] and the [[Nizamate of Hyderabad]].

After two wars and the proclamation of the Indian Empire, the region became a part of the [[Bombay Province]], the [[Berar Province]] and the [[Central Provinces]] of India under direct British rule and the [[Deccan States Agency]] under Crown suzerainty. Between 1950 and 1956, the Bombay Province became the Bombay State in the Indian Union, and Berar, the Deccan states and the Gujarat states were merged into the Bombay State. Aspirations of a separate state for Marathi-speaking peoples were pursued by the [[Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti|United Maharashtra Movement]]; their advocacy eventually borne fruit on 1 May 1960, when the State of Bombay was bifurcated into the states of Maharasthra and Gujarat.

The state has limited area under irrigation, low natural fertility of soils, and large areas prone to recurrent drought. Due to this the agricultural productivity of Maharashtra is generally low as compared to the national averages of various crops. Maharashtra has been divided in to nine agro-climatic zones on the basis of annual rainfall soil types, vegetation and cropping pattern.<ref name="Agro Zones">{{cite web |title=Agro Climatic Zones of Maharashtra |url=http://krishi.maharashtra.gov.in/Site/Upload/Pdf/mwsip.pdf |publisher=[[Ministry of Agriculture]] |access-date=1 April 2022 |archive-date=19 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220119044547/http://krishi.maharashtra.gov.in/Site/Upload/Pdf/mwsip.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

The state has three crucial biogeographic zones, namely [[Western Ghats]], [[Deccan Plateau]], and the [[Western Coastal Plains|West coast]]. The Ghats nurture endemic species, Deccan Plateau provides for vast mountain ranges and grasslands while the coast is home to littoral and swamp forests. Flora of Maharashtra is heterogeneous in composition. In 2012 the recorded thick forest area in the state was {{cvt|61939|sqkm|sqmi}} which was about 20.13% of the state's geographical area.<ref name="forest percentile">{{cite web |title=The State's forest cover |url=http://www.mahaforest.nic.in/internal.php?id=23 |website=Wildlife Conservation Trust, Mumbai |publisher=[[Government of Maharashtra]] |access-date=13 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314005839/http://mahaforest.nic.in/internal.php?id=23 |archive-date=14 March 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> There are three main Public Forestry Institutions (PFIs) in the Maharashtra state: the [[Maharashtra Forest Department]] (MFD), the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) and the Directorate of Social Forestry (SFD).<ref name=Forestry>{{cite web |title=Forest department |url=http://mahaforest.nic.in/index.php |website=Forest Management system |publisher=[[Government of Maharashtra]] |access-date=13 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313214004/http://mahaforest.nic.in/index.php |archive-date=13 March 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The Maharashtra State Biodiversity Board, constituted by the Government of Maharashtra in January 2012 under the Biological Diversity Act, 2002, is the nodal body for the conservation of biodiversity within and outside forest areas in the State.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mahaforest.nic.in/fckimagefile/Notification__.pdf |title=Formation of the Maharashtra State Biodiversity Board |website=Maharashtra Forest Department |access-date=29 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190819042126/http://www.mahaforest.nic.in/fckimagefile/Notification__.pdf |archive-date=19 August 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://maharashtrabiodiversityboard.gov.in/about-us/ |title=About Us {{!}} Maharashtra State Biodiversity Board |website=Maharashtra State Biodiversity Board |access-date=29 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191214182309/http://maharashtrabiodiversityboard.gov.in/about-us/ |archive-date=14 December 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Politics===
{{See also|Politics of Maharashtra|List of chief ministers of Maharashtra}}

The politics of the state in the first decades after its formation in 1960 was dominated by the [[Indian National Congress]] party or its offshoots such as the [[Nationalist Congress Party]]. At present, it has been dominated by four political parties, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]], the [[Nationalist Congress Party]], the [[Indian National Congress]] and the [[Shivsena]].The politics of the state in the last five years has seen long term alliances breaking up like that of undivided Shivsena and BJP, new ones being formed between Congress, NCP, and the Shivsena, regional parties like the Shivsena and NCP splitting up, and majority of their legislators joining a new alliance government with the BJP.{{Citation needed|date=July 2024}}

Each food item served on the ''thali'' is arranged in a specific way. All non-vegetarian and vegetarian dishes are eaten with boiled rice, [[chapati]]s or with [[bhakri]]s, made of jowar, bajra or rice flours. A typical vegetarian thali is made of [[chapati]] or [[bhakri]] (Indian flat bread), [[dal]], rice (varan bhaat), amti, ''[[bhaji]] or [[usal]]'', [[chutney]], ''koshimbir'' (salad) and [[buttermilk]] or ''Sol kadhi''. A ''bhaji'' is a vegetable dish made of a particular vegetable or combination of vegetables. ''Aamti'' is variant of the curry, typically consisting of a lentil (''tur'') stock, flavoured with goda masala and sometimes with tamarind or amshul, and [[jaggery]] (''gul'').<ref name="cuisine" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Maharashtra Recipes |url=http://food.ndtv.com/recipes/indian-recipes |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225091730/http://food.ndtv.com/recipes/indian-recipes |archive-date=25 December 2014 |access-date=13 September 2014 |website=food.ndtv.com |publisher=NDTV}}</ref> ''Varan'' is nothing but plain [[dal]], a common Indian lentil stew.
