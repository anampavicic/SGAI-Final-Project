== Etymology ==
{{Also|Valencia#Name}}
The city of Valencia (capital of the Valencian Community) was founded by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] under the name of {{lang|la|[[wikt:Valentia|Valentia]] [[wikt:Edetani|Edetanorum]]}}, or simply {{lang|la|Valentia}}, which translates to "strength" or "valour", in full "strength of the [[Edetani]]" (the centre of Edetania was [[Edeta]], an important old Iberian settlement 25&nbsp;km north of Valencia, in what is now modern day [[Llíria]], other important nearby settlements included [[Saguntum|Arse–Saguntum]], [[Saetabis]] and [[Dénia|Dianium]]).

With the establishment of the Muslim [[Taifa of Valencia]], during the [[Al-Andalus]] period, the name developed to {{lang|ar|بلنسية|rtl=yes}} ({{transl|ar|Balansiya}}). The modern names of the city are {{lang|es|Valencia}} (Spanish) and {{lang|ca-valencia|València}} (Valencian). The older spellings ''Valençia'', ''Ualençia'' and ''Ualència'' are also found in pre-reform Spanish and Valencian texts.

To distinguish it from its capital city, a number of names have been used for the region. After the Christian conquest, it became the [[Kingdom of Valencia]]. In the last decades, ''Valencian Community'' has become the preferred name to avoid any [[#Naming controversy|controversy]].

=== Naming controversy ===
{{main|Names of the Valencian Community}}
"Valencian Community" is the standard translation of the official name in Valencian recognized by the Statute of Autonomy of 1982 ({{lang|ca-valencia|Comunitat Valenciana}}).<ref name=":1"/> This is the name most used in public administration, tourism, the media and Spanish written language. However, the variant of "Valencian Country" ({{lang|ca-valencia|País Valencià}}) that emphasizes the nationality status of the Valencian people is still the preferred one by left-wing parties, civil associations, Valencian written language and major Valencian public institutions.<ref>Mollà, Toni (1998).

"Valencian Community" is a [[neologism]] that was specifically adopted after democratic transition in order to solve the conflict between two competing names: "Valencian Country" and "Former Kingdom of Valencia".<ref name="preamble" /> On one hand, "Valencian Country" represented the modern conception of nationality that [[Renaixença|resurged]] in the 19th century. It became well-established during the [[Second Spanish Republic]] and later on with the works of [[Joan Fuster]] in the 1960s, implying the existence of the "Catalan Countries" ({{lang|ca|[[Països Catalans]]}}). This nationalist subtext was opposed by anti-Catalan [[Blaverism|blaverists]], who proposed "Former Kingdom of Valencia" ({{lang|ca-valencia|Antic Regne de València}}) instead, in order to emphasize Valencian independence from Catalonia. Currently, blaverists have accepted the official denomination.

The autonomous community can be homonymously identified with its capital "Valencia".<ref>According to [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/621977/Valencia article Valencia] from [http://www.britannica.com Britannica Online Encyclopedia]</ref> However, this could be disregarding of the provinces of Alicante and Castellón. Other more anecdotal translations have included "Land of Valencia",<ref>[http://www.comunitatvalenciana.com/descargas/paisajes_in.pdf Scenery in Land of Valencia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509132911/http://www.comunitatvalenciana.com/descargas/paisajes_in.pdf |date=9 May 2008}}, edited by the ''Valencian Agency of Tourism''</ref> "Region of Valencia"<ref>Terms mainly used from the Department of Tourism of the Valencian Government.

The other term, "Land of Valencia" is also used by this department</ref> and "Valencian Region".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040528120131/http://www.comunitatvalenciana.com/publicaciones/descargas.htm#cvnews CVNews], English-language magazine published by the ''Valencia Region Tourist Board''</ref> The term "Region", however, carries negative connotations among many Valencians because it could deny their nationality status.

== History ==

{{See also|Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin}}
[[File:Tossal-plantagral.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Archeological site of Tossal de Manises, ancient [[Iberians|Iberian]]&ndash;[[Ancient greek|Greek]]&ndash;[[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]]&ndash;[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city of ''Akra Leuke'' or ''[[Lucentum]]'', Alicante.]]
[[File:Castillo villena.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Villena [[Atalaya Castle (Spain)|castle]] (see [[Route of the Castles of Vinalopó]])]]

The pre-Roman autochthonous people of the Valencian Community were the [[Iberians]], who were divided in several groups (the ''[[Contestani]]'', the ''[[Edetani]]'', the ''[[Ilercavones]]'' and the ''[[Bastetani]]'').

The Greeks established [[Greek colonies|colonies]] in the coastal towns of ''[[Saguntum]]'' and ''[[Dénia|Dianium]]'' beginning in the 5th century BC, where they traded and mixed with the local Iberian populations. After the end of the [[First Punic War]] between [[Carthage]] and [[Rome]] in 241 BC, which established their limits of influence in the Ebro river, the [[Carthaginian Iberia|Carthaginians]] occupied the whole region. The dispute over the hegemony of ''[[Siege of Saguntum|Saguntum]]'', a Hellenized Iberian coastal city with diplomatic contacts with Rome, destroyed by [[Hannibal]] in 219 BC, ignited the [[Second Punic War]], which ended with the incorporation of the region to the Roman Empire.

The Romans founded the city of ''[[wikt:Valentia|Valentia]]'' in 138 BC, which, over the centuries overtook ''Saguntum'' in importance. After the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]], during the [[Barbarian Invasions]] in the 5th century AD, the region was first invaded by the [[Alans]] and finally ruled by the [[Visigoths]] (see [[Valencian Gothic]]), until the arrival of the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Arabs]] in 711, which left a broad impact in the region, still visible in today's Valencian landscape and culture. After the fall of the [[Caliphate of Córdoba|Caliphate of Cordova]], two main independent [[taifas]] were established at the region, [[Taifa of Valencia|Valencia]] and [[Taifa of Dénia|Dénia]], along with the small and short living taifas of [[Taifa of Orihuela|Orihuela]], [[Taifa of Alpuente|Alpuente]], Jérica and [[Taifa of Murviedro and Sagunto|Sagunt]] and the short Christian conquest of Valencia by [[El Cid]].

However, the origins of present-day Valencia date back to the [[Kingdom of Valencia]], which came into existence in the 13th century. [[James I of Aragon]] led the [[Reconquista|Christian conquest]] and colonization of the existing [[Islam]]ic [[taifa]]s with Aragonese and Catalan colonizers in 1208; they founded the Kingdom of Valencia as a third independent country within the [[Crown of Aragon]] in 1238.

The kingdom developed intensively in the 14th and 15th centuries, which are considered the Golden Age of the Valencian culture,<ref>''[[:es:Siglo de Oro Valenciano|Siglo de Oro Valenciano]]'' (Spanish Wikipedia)</ref> with significant works like the [[chivalric romance]] of [[Tirant lo Blanch]]. Valencia developed into an important kingdom in Europe economically through the silk trade. It also rose to power politically with the rise of the Crown of Aragon, (within which the Kingdom of Valencia had achieved the largest population and the greatest economic power at that time)<ref>José Escribano Úbeda-Portugués: España y Europa a través de la Historia. Desde el siglo XV al Siglo XVIII pp 16-17</ref> and the ascension of the Valencian [[House of Borgia|House of Borja]] in Rome (see [[Route of the Borgias|Route of the Borjas]], [[Route of the Monasteries of Valencia|Route of the Monasteries]] and [[Route of the Valencian classics|Route of the Classics]]).

After a slow decline following the [[dynastic union]] of the Crown of Aragon with the Kingdom of Castile, Valencia's successful status came to a definite end with the [[Expulsion of the Moriscos]] in 1609 by the Hispanic Monarchy, which represented the loss of up to one third of the population of the Kingdom of Valencia and took the main agricultural labor force away. [[File:Torres quart.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Quart Towers, [[Valencia, Spain|city of Valencia]]]]In 1707, in the context of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], and by means of the [[Nueva Planta decrees|''Nova Planta'']] decrees, king [[Philip V of Spain]] abolished the Kingdom of Valencia, and the rest of the states belonging to the former [[Crown of Aragon]] and which had retained some autonomy, and subordinated it to the structure of the [[Kingdom of Castile]] and its laws and customs. As a result of this, the institutions and laws created by the [[Furs of Valencia|Law of Valencia]] (''Furs de València'') were abolished and the usage of the Valencian language in official instances and education was forbidden. Consequently, with the [[House of Bourbon]], a new Kingdom of Spain was formed implementing a more centralized government and absolutist regime than the former [[Habsburg Spain]].

The first attempt to gain [[self-government]], or autonomous government, for the Valencian Community in modern-day Spain was during the [[Second Spanish Republic]], in 1936, but the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] broke out and the autonomist project was suspended.<ref>[[:es:Proyecto de Estatuto de Autonomía para el País Valenciano (1937)|''Proyecto de Estatuto de Autonomía para el País Valenciano'' (1937)]] (Spanish Wikipedia)</ref> In 1977, after [[Spain under Franco|Franco]]'s dictatorship Valencia started to be partially autonomous with the creation of the Council of the Valencian Country (''Consell del País Valencià''),<ref>[[:es:Real Decreto-Ley 10/1978, de 17 de marzo, por el que se aprueba el Régimen Preautonómico del País Valenciano|''Real Decreto-Ley 10/1978, de 17 de marzo, por el que se aprueba el Régimen Preautonómico del País Valenciano'' (Spanish Wikipedia)]]</ref> and in 1982 the self-government was finally extended into a [[Statute of Autonomy]] (''Estatut d'Autonomia'') creating several self-government institutions under the [[Generalitat Valenciana]].  The first democratically elected [[President of the Generalitat Valenciana]], [[Joan Lerma]], took office in 1982 as part of the transition to autonomy.<ref name="elpais">{{Cite news |last=Caballer |first=Neus |url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2011/10/07/actualidad/1317975428_850215.html |title=''Fallece el expresidente preautonómico de la Generalitat Enrique Monsonís'' |date=7 October 2011 |work=[[El País]] |language=es |trans-title=Former pre-autonomous president of the Generalitat Enrique Monsonís dies}}</ref>

The Valencian Statute of Autonomy make clear that Valencia is intended to be the modern conception of self-government of the Valencian Community from the first autonomist movements during [[Second Spanish Republic]], but also joining it to the traditional conception of Valencian identity, as being the successor to the historical Kingdom of Valencia.<ref name="preamble" /> In fact, after a bipartisan reform of the Valencian Statute of Autonomy in 2006, it records the [[Furs of Valencia|foral civil law]], using the traditional conception of a kingdom, and, on the other hand, it also recognizes Valencia as a [[nationality]], in accordance with the modern conception.

== Geography ==
[[File:Land of Valencia, NASA satellite image.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of the Valencian Community.]]

=== Relief ===
The inland part of the territory is craggy, with some of the highest peaks in the Valencia and Castellón provinces forming part of the [[Sistema Ibérico|Iberian Mountain Range]]. The mountains in the Province of Alicante are in turn a part of the [[Baetic System|Subbaetic Range]].

The most emblematic mountain of the Valencian Community is the [[Penyagolosa]], in the [[Alcalatén]] area. It is widely thought to be the highest peak with 1,813 m, but actually the highest peak is the ''Calderón'' (1,839 m) located in the [[Rincón de Ademuz]], a Valencian [[exclave]] between [[Aragon]] and [[Castilla–La Mancha]]. The most emblematic mountain in the southern part of the territory is the [[Aitana (mountain)|Aitana]] (1,558 m).

The rather thin coastal strip is a very [[fertile soil|fertile]] plain without remarkable mountains except those around the [[Cap de la Nau]] area in northern Alicante province and the [[Peníscola|Peñíscola]] area in the Castellón province. Typical of this coastal area are wetlands and marshlands such as ''[[Albufera|L'Albufera]]'' close to Valencia, ''[[Natural Park of El Fondo|El Fondo]]'' in [[Elche]] and [[Crevillent]], ''La Marjal'' near [[Pego, Alicante|Pego]], [[Albufera of Gayanes]] in [[Gaianes|Gayanes]] or ''El Prat'' in [[Cabanes, Castellón|Cabanes]], also the former wetlands and [[salt evaporation pond]]s in the [[Santa Pola]] and [[Torrevieja]] area. All of them are key [[Ramsar site]]s which make Valencia of high relevance for both migratory and resident seabirds and waterbirds.

There are many important [[Dunes#Coastal dunes|coastal dunes]] in the ''Saler'' area near the Albufera and in the [[Guardamar]] area, both of them were planted with thousands of trees during the 19th century in order to fix the dunes, thus forming now protected areas of remarkable ecologic value.

In addition to mainland Valencia, the Valencian territory administers the tiny [[Columbretes Islands]] and the coastal inhabited islet of [[Tabarca]].

[[File:Mapa_físic_del_País_Valencià.png|230px|thumb|Relief map of the Community.]]

=== Climate ===
Valencia has a generally pleasant climate, with mild winters and hot summers, heavily influenced by the neighbouring Mediterranean sea. Still, there are important differences between areas:

*Typical [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csa''). It roughly goes along the coastal plain from the northernmost border through the [[Marina Baixa|Benidorm area]] (cities included here are, amongst others, [[Castellón de la Plana]], [[Gandia]] and [[Valencia]]). It covers in various grades the lower inland areas. In this area, winters are mild, summers are long, dry and hot; rainfall occurs mostly during spring and autumn, usually totalling around 600&nbsp;mm. with a remarkably wetter [[micro climate]] in the [[Marina Alta]] and the [[Safor]] ''comarques'' just north of [[Cap de la Nau]] cape, which accumulates an average of up to 1000&nbsp;mm. due to an [[orographic lift]] phenomenon.
*[[Mediterranean climate]] with continental influences ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csa'') and Mediterranean [[highland climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csb''). These are the innermost lands and those at a higher elevation (cities included here are, amongst others, [[Alcoy, Spain|Alcoy]], [[Morella, Castellón|Morella]], [[Requena, Valencia|Requena]] and [[Villena]]). Here winters are cool to cold, especially at night (a few days of snow are not unusual), summers mild to hot and rainfall more evenly distributed through the year. The lower registered temperatures in the Valencian Community were in these inland areas during the cold wave of 1956. Temperatures plunged to nearly −20&nbsp;°C; as in [[Vistabella del Maestrat]] (−19&nbsp;°C) and Castellfort (–17&nbsp;°C).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.estrellasyborrascas.com/articulos/frio_1956.pdf |title=La gran ola de frío de febrero de 1956 en la España mediterránea |last1=José Ángel Núñez |last2=Carlos Muedra |language=es |trans-title=The great cold snap of February 1956 in Mediterranean Spain |last3=Vicente Aupí}}</ref>
*[[Hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSh''), although in higher altitude zones at the interior the average temperatures are lower, being BSk in the [[Köppen climate classification]]. It roughly goes along the coastal plain from [[Villajoyosa / La Vila Joiosa|Villajoyosa]] through the southernmost border of the territory (cities included here are, amongst others, [[Alicante]], [[Benidorm]], [[Elche]], [[Orihuela]] and [[Torrevieja]]). Summers are hot and dry, winters are mild and its most prominent feature is a very scarce precipitation, typically below 300&nbsp;mm. per year which is most likely to happen during spring and autumn. The reason for this lack of precipitation is the marked [[rain shadow]] effect caused by hills to the west of the Alicante province (and, to a lesser degree, those in the northern part of the province which, in turn, enhance the inverse orographic lift effect around [[Cap de la Nau]]).

The [[warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csb''), [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb'') and the [[hot desert climate|desertic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BWh'') are also found in the Valencian Community. The ''Csb'' climate is more common and is found in inland, high altitude areas (generally starting above {{convert|1000|m|ft}}) across the 3 provinces of the Valencian Community, especially in the interior of [[Province of Castellón|Castellón]] but also in [[Rincón de Ademuz|El Rincón de Ademuz]] and the north of [[Los Serranos]] comarcas in the province of [[Valencia (province)|Valencia]]. In the province of [[Alicante (province)|Alicante]] this climate is only found in the highest altitudes of [[Serra de Mariola]] and [[Aitana (mountain)|Sierra de Aitana]]. Both ''Cfa'' and ''Cfb'' climates can be only found in the interior of the province of Castellón, with marginal presence in the Valencian province, only in the Rincón de Ademuz comarca. The presence of the desertic climates (''BWh'') is marginal to scarcely populated areas south of [[Elche]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aemet.es/documentos/es/conocermas/recursos_en_linea/publicaciones_y_estudios/publicaciones/MapasclimaticosdeEspana19812010/MapasclimaticosdeEspana19812010.pdf|title=MAPAS CLIMÁTICOS DE ESPAÑA (1981-2010) Clasificación Climática de Köppen-Geiger en la península ibérica.

=== Hydrography ===
There are only two major rivers: the [[Segura (river)|Segura]] in the province of Alicante, whose source is in [[Andalusia]], and the [[Júcar]] (or ''Xúquer'') in the province of Valencia, whose source is in [[Castilla–La Mancha]]. Both are subjected to very intense human regulation for cities, industries and, especially, agricultural consumption. The river [[Turia (river)|Turia]] (or ''Túria'') is the third largest and has its source in [[Aragon]]. Most [[Arroyo (creek)|rivers]] in the area, such as the [[Vinalopó]], are usually short, have little current (due to agricultural usage, climatic reasons or both) and are often completely dry during the summer. Other Valencian rivers are the [[Serpis]] and [[Sénia River|Sénia]].

== Demographics ==
{{Main|Valencian people}}

The Valencian Community is, with 5,216,195 inhabitants (INE 2023),<ref name=":2"/> the fourth autonomous community in Spain by population, and represents 10.85% of the national population. Its population is very unevenly distributed: it is concentrated on the coastal strip and has an average population density of 224.3 inhabitants/km². The community has shown strong demographic growth from the 1960s until 2023, when it reaches its maximum; 17.03% of its population is of foreign nationality (INE 2023). Despite the high population rate, there are 24 municipalities, most of them in the province of Castellón, that have less than 100 inhabitants. Castell de Cabres with 19 inhabitants is the town in the Valencian Community with the smallest number of inhabitants.

The study of the demographic evolution of the Valencian Community can be divided into two clearly differentiated periods, which belong to two different moments of the demographic transition: the old demographic cycle or regime (until the 18th century), characterized by high mortality and high birth rates, and the modern demographic regime or cycle (from the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th), in which the drop in mortality initially caused a demographic transition, with strong increases in the population, which passed in its final moments of demographic stability thanks to the drop in birth rates. In the case of the Valencian Community, and in Spain as a whole, both cycles temporarily coincided with the non-presence of reliable population censuses, which would not allow a precise study of demographic states and processes.

=== Urbanization ===
{{See also|List of municipalities in the Valencian Community}}

Valencian population traditionally concentrated in localities with [[fertile soil|fertile]] cultivation and growing lowlands by the most important rivers ([[Júcar]] or ''Xúquer'', [[Turia (river)|Turia]] or ''Túria'', [[Segura (river)|Segura]], and [[Vinalopó]]), also in harbour cities important to the agricultural trade. In actuality, population is particularly dense along the coast as well as in central and southern regions of the territory, and more sparse around the inner and northern regions. Important historical cities include [[Sagunto]] and [[Dénia]] in [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times; [[Valencia]], [[Alicante]], [[Xàtiva]], [[Orihuela]], [[Elche]], [[Gandia]], and [[Villarreal]] or ''Vila-real'' later on in history and, more recently, [[Alzira, Valencia|Alzira]] and [[Castellón de la Plana]]. Another set of noncoastal cities increased significantly in numbers due to [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] in the 20th century, including [[Alcoy, Spain|Alcoy]] or ''Alcoi'', [[Elda]], [[Ontinyent]], [[Petrer]], [[Villena]], and [[La Vall d'Uixó]].

In recent decades, the concentration of population around the large capitals has increased and large metropolitan areas have been formed, although the demographic concentration has also occurred in coastal towns and cities, so that traditionally small populations, such as the [[Benidorm]], [[Gandia]], [[Calpe]] or [[Torrevieja]] have experienced a very considerable population increase, even greater during the summer season, mainly due to the seasonal migrations of the tourism industry workforce.

[[File:Comunidad-Valenciana Densidad.png|thumb|200px|Areas in red mark higher population density in the central and southern regions.]]

==== Metropolitan areas ====
The main metropolitan areas of the Valencian Community according to their population are three, plus a fourth one shared with the [[Region of Murcia]]. The most populous one is the metropolitan area of [[Valencia]], which is located in the central area of the Gulf of Valencia, around the Valencian Community's capital. It is the third largest in Spain, with 1,774,201 inhabitants (INE 2011).

The metropolitan area of [[Alicante]]-[[Elche]] has 757,085 inhabitants (INE 2014) and is the eighth metropolitan area in Spain by population; it is the sum of the urban areas of Alicante (468,581 inhabitants) and Elche-Crevillent (288,504 inhabitants), therefore a bipolar metropolitan area.

The metropolitan area of Castellón de la Plana is made up of the municipalities of [[Castellón de la Plana]], [[Almassora]], [[Villarreal]], [[Benicàssim]], [[Borriol]] and [[Burriana]] or Borriana, and has 309,420 inhabitants (INE 2008) and an area of 340 km²; Castellón de la Plana is the main centre and most populous municipality of this metropolitan area.

The [[Murcia]]-[[Orihuela]] metropolitan area includes the urban area of Orihuela in the Valencian Community, plus the metropolitan agglomerations of Murcia, Molina de Segura and Alcantarilla, in the neighboring [[Region of Murcia]]. This supraregional metropolitan area has a total population of 776,784 inhabitants (INE 2009), an area of 1,787 km² and a density of 445.54 inhabitants/km², making it the seventh largest in Spain.

In recent decades the concentration of the population in the provincial capitals and in their metropolitan areas has increased considerably, in cities such as [[Torrent, Valencia|Torrent]], [[Mislata]], [[Paterna]], [[Burjassot]], or [[San Vicente del Raspeig / Sant Vicent del Raspeig|San Vicente del Raspeig]].

According to the INE, the largest metropolitan areas are:

== Government ==

=== Institutions of government: ''La Generalitat'' ===
{{See also|List of Valencian political parties}}
[[File:Palau generalitat9.jpg|thumb|''Palau de la Generalitat Valenciana'', seat of the [[Generalitat Valenciana|Valencian government]]]]

In the process whereby democracy was restored in Spain between 1975 and 1978, the [[nationalism|nationalist]] and [[regionalism (politics)|regionalist]] parties pressed to grant [[home rule]] to certain territories in Spain. The constitution of 1978 opened a legal way for autonomous communities to be formed from provinces with common historical and cultural links. In recognition of the Valencian Community as a ''[[nationalities and regions of Spain|nationality]]'' of Spain, and in accordance to the second article of the [[Spanish Constitution]] which grants autonomy to the "[[Nationalities and regions of Spain|''nationalities'' and regions]]" that compose the Spanish nation, Valencia was granted self-government and constituted itself as an [[autonomous community]] in 1982, with the promulgation of its first [[Statute of Autonomy]], the basic organic law, later approved by the General Courts of Spain.

All autonomous communities were organized politically within a [[parliamentary system]]; that is, the executive branch of government. The "President" is dependent on the direct support of the [[legislative power]], whose members elect him by [[majority]].

A new Statute of Autonomy was promulgated in 2006. The government of Valencia is represented by the [[Generalitat Valenciana]] (statutorily referred to simply as ''La Generalitat'') constituted by three institutions:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://narros.congreso.es/constitucion/estatutos/estatutos.jsp?com=79&tipo=2&ini=20&fin=48&ini_sub=1&fin_sub=1 |title=Third Section, First Chapter of the Statute of Autonomy of the Valencian Community |access-date=14 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226140701/http://narros.congreso.es/constitucion/estatutos/estatutos.jsp?com=79&tipo=2&ini=20&fin=48&ini_sub=1&fin_sub=1 |archive-date=26 December 2007|language=es}}</ref>

* the [[Corts Valencianes]] (Valencian parliament), the [[legislature]], which is to be integrated by a minimum of ninety-two representatives (''diputats'') elected through [[universal suffrage]] by [[proportional representation]] for a four-year period;
* the [[President of the Generalitat Valenciana]] must obtain the vote of confidence from the Courts; the current President is [[Carlos Mazón]] (from the [[People's Party of the Valencian Community]]).
* the [[Council of the Generalitat Valenciana]] (Valencian government), a collegiate institution with executive powers, integrated by the President him/herself and the cabinet members appointed by him/her.

The Generalitat can also be integrated by the institutions that the Valencian Courts create. The Courts have approved the creation of the ''[[Síndic de Greuges of the Valencian Community|Síndic de Greuges]]'' ([[Ombudsman]]), the ''[[Sindicatura de Comptes of the Valencian Community|Sindicatura de Comptes]]'' (Public Audit Office), the ''[[Valencian Council of Culture|Consell Valencià de Cultura]]'' (Valencian Council of Culture), the ''[[Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua]]'' (Valencian Academy of the Language), the ''Consell Jurídic Consultiu'' (Juridic and Consultative Council) and the ''Comité Econòmic i Social'' (Social and Economic Committee).

===Administrative divisions===
Prior to the [[1833 territorial division of Spain]] Valencia was divided into four administrative [[1822 territorial division of Spain|provinces of Spain]]: [[Province of Alicante|Alicante]], [[Province of Castellón|Castellón]], [[Province of Valencia|Valencia]] and [[Province of Játiva|Xàtiva]].

From 1833, the current three-province system was consolidated:

*[[Province of Alicante|Alicante]], capital: [[Alicante]]
*[[Province of Castellón|Castellón]], capital: [[Castellón de la Plana]]
*[[Province of Valencia|Valencia]], capital: [[Valencia]]

The Valencian Community is further divided into 34 ''[[comarcas of Spain|comarques]]'' (including the city of Valencia) and 542 [[municipalities of the Valencian Community|municipalities]] (141 in the Province of Alicante, 135 in the Province of Castellón, and 266 in the Province of Valencia).

== Economy ==
[[File:La Ciudad de las Artes y las Ciencias de Valencia.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Ciutat de les Arts i les Ciències]]'', [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]]]
[[File:Benidorm vista 04.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Skyline of [[Benidorm]]]]
[[File:7. Vistes des de la muntanya de les Raboses (País Valencià).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Cullera]] tourism, town near the [[Albufera Natural Park]]]]

Valencia is long and narrow, running mainly north–south; historically, its rather steep and irregular terrain has made communications and the exploitation of the soil difficult, although the soil of the coastal plain is particularly [[fertile soil|fertile]]. This coastal axis has facilitated connections with Europe, either by sea through the Mediterranean, or by land through [[Catalonia]].

The Valencian territory has few natural resources; the only important mineral deposit is the [[marble]] quarried in Alicante province.

Hydrological resources (see [[#Geography|Geography]] above) are also lacking: the demand for water exceeds the supply, with this imbalance especially serious in Alicante province. In particularly severe drought years, the problem is managed through occasional nocturnal restrictions during summer and exploitation of aquifers. Valencia's water needs result in harsh contention with neighbouring autonomous communities such as [[Castilla–La Mancha]] and Catalonia.

Agriculture&mdash;more specifically, [[citrus]] cultivation for the export market&mdash;was responsible for Valencia's first economic boom in the late 19th century, after centuries of slow development and even decay. Although in absolute terms the agricultural sector has continued to grow, the boom in the [[secondary sector|secondary]] and [[tertiary sector]]s during the [[Spanish miracle]] of the 1960s, has meant that its relative importance has decreased over time. The provinces of [[Province of Castellón|Castellón]] and Valencia still have thousands of hectares of citrus-producing groves and citrus continues to be a major source of income on the countryside. [[Province of Alicante]] also grows citrus, but its agriculture is more diversified with a higher presence of [[vegetables]], especially in the [[Vega Baja del Segura]] area.

Though the low insulation rate <!-- what on earth is an "insulation rate" - jmabel --> and overall stable weather during the summer may pose a threat to water supplies for agriculture and human consumption, conversely this climate allows tourism to be the province's main industry. Very dense residential housing along the coast, occupied by locals, people from inland Spain and from other EU countries (mostly from the British Isles, Benelux, Germany and Scandinavia), boosts the summertime population (and hydrological demands).

In 2004, Valencia's GDP was 93.9% of the European Union average,<ref>{{Citation |title=Regional GDP per inhabitant in the EU27: GDP per inhabitant in 2004 ranged from 24% of the EU27 average in Nord-Est in Romania to 303% in Inner London |date=19 February 2007 |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/PGP_PRD_CAT_PREREL/PGE_CAT_PREREL_YEAR_2007/PGE_CAT_PREREL_YEAR_2007_MONTH_02/1-19022007-EN-AP.PDF |work=Eurostat News Release |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326210729/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/PGP_PRD_CAT_PREREL/PGE_CAT_PREREL_YEAR_2007/PGE_CAT_PREREL_YEAR_2007_MONTH_02/1-19022007-EN-AP.PDF |publisher=Eurostat Press Office |access-date=17 November 2012 |archive-date=26 March 2009 }}</ref> although this figure may be too low because of the important presence of foreign residents either from other regions of Europe or as economic immigrants, who are not properly represented in the official statistics. As in all of Spain, there was significant growth in the years immediately following 2004, at least until the [[2008–13 Spanish financial crisis]].

In 2008, the Valencia Community generated 9.7% of the Spanish GDP. According to human resources, the unemployment rate was over 21% in 2009, and even greater among women,<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://epoca1.valenciaplaza.com/ver/2237/El-paro-alcanza-el-23-en-la-Comunidad-Valenciana.html |title=El paro alcanza el 23% en la Comunidad Valenciana |work=Valencia Plaza |agency=EFE |language=es |trans-title=Unemployment reaches 23% in the Valencian Community}}</ref> and the rate of activity <!-- what is a "rate of activity" - jmabel --> reached 56.8% in 2002. The typical Valencian business is a small-to-medium-sized company, mainly family-owned and operated, although there are some multinationals.

In addition to tourism, the Valencian Community has significant exports, and it ranks second in this respect among the Spanish autonomous communities, constituting 12% of the national total. Major exports include agricultural products, ceramic tiles, marble products and cars ([[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] has an assembly line in [[Almussafes]]), which make the port of Valencia one of the busiest in Europe.

=== Unemployment ===
The unemployment rate stood at 15.6% in 2018 and was higher than the national average.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&init=1&language=de&pcode=tgs00010&plugin=1 |title=Regional Unemployment by NUTS2 Region |website=Eurostat |publisher=European Union}}</ref>

== Language ==
{{Main|Valencian language|Valencian Sign Language|Spanish language|}}
[[Spanish language|Spanish]] (''español'' or ''castellano'') has official status in all of Spain, including the Valencian Community. Aside from it, the [[Statute of Autonomy]] recognizes [[Valencian language|Valencian]] (''valencià'') as the language native (''llengua pròpia'') to the Valencian people,{{citation needed|date=December 2021}} and commends its protection and regulation to the [[Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua]] (AVL) under the [[Generalitat Valenciana]].

''Valencian'' is the historical, traditional and official name of the native language of the Valencian Community. Valencians use ''Valencian'' to refer to the [[Romance language]] also known as [[Catalan language]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.avl.gva.es/lexicval/mobile/ |dictionary=Diccionari normatiu valencià |access-date=9 March 2011 |title=AVL |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930081235/http://www.avl.gva.es/lexicval/mobile/ |archive-date=30 September 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> In the [[Late Middle Ages]], due to Valencia becoming its own [[Kingdom of Valencia|kingdom]], Valencians popularized the term ''Valencian'' over the term ''Catalan''.{{sfn|Beltran i Calvo|Segura i Llopes|2018|p=35}}

Valencian was marginalized during Franco's dictatorship (1939–1975) in favor of [[Spanish language|Spanish]].<ref>The implementation of Franco's regime in the Valencian Community since 1939 meant the Valencian ban on its use on the radio, books, theater, different civilians forms such as wedding invitations, signs and announcements, person's first names, cinema (until 1964), in all public and private schools, on the gravestones of the cemeteries and mortuary skeletons, in the nomenclature of hotels, restaurants or brands, on inscriptions in the Civil register, on the names of the streets, among other fields.

Modern Valencian shares similar [[phonetics|phonetic]] and [[lexicon|lexical]] features with the [[Western Catalan]] dialects,{{sfn|Wheeler|2006}} which includes seven stressed vowels (being especially remarkable the distinction of {{IPAslink|ɛ}} vs {{IPAslink|e}} and {{IPAslink|ɔ}} vs {{IPAslink|o}}), unstressed [[vowel reduction]] (normally five) and [[vowel harmony]]; the preservation of [[voiced palatal approximant|yod]] ({{IPA|/j/}}) before {{IPA|/ʃ/}} in the digraph ''[[ix (digraph)|ix]]''; the addition of ''[[n]]'' in the plural of certain terms with etymological ''n''; and a tendency to affrication of ''[[soft g|g]]'' (before ''e'' and ''i'') and ''[[j]]'' {{IPAslink|dʒ}}, and ''[[x]]'' {{IPAslink|tʃ}}, especially in initial position. Common specific lexicon includes: ''[[wikt:granera|granera]]'' (broom), ''[[wikt:xiquet|xiquet]]'' (boy), ''[[wikt:espill|espill]]'' (mirror), ''[[wikt:corder|corder]]'' (lamb), etc.

[[Valencian Sign Language]] is widely used by Valencian deaf persons and is also granted protection under the Statute.

The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] spoken in the cities is little affected by Valencian and features [[phonological history of Spanish coronal fricatives|''distinción'']], i.e. the differentiation of {{IPAslink|s}} (''[[s]]'') and {{IPAslink|θ}} (''[[c]]'' before ''e'' and ''i'', and [[z]]), and {{lang|es|[[yeísmo]]}} (the merger of {{IPAslink|ʎ}}–''[[ll]]'' in Spanish orthography–into {{IPAslink|ʝ}}, represented as ''[[y]]''). In the south of the Valencian Community, dialects similar to neighbouring [[Murcian Spanish]] are spoken, featuring both ''distinción'' and ''[[seseo]]'' (the merger of {{IPA|/θ/}} into {{IPA|/s/}}), depending on the speaker and area. In the east, traits in common with the Spanish of either Aragon or La Mancha are found in the local Spanish.

=== Areas of linguistic predominance ===
[[File:Extensió del valencià al País Valencià.svg|thumb|The traditionally Valencian-speaking territories are marked in green]]
Not all of the Valencian territory is historically Valencian-speaking; about 1 million people, or 20% of the population, live in inland or southern areas that are traditionally Spanish-speaking. This area comprises around 35-40% of the extension of the Valencian Community. These regions include the areas where [[Aragonese people|Aragonese]] rather than Catalan settlers introduced the Castilian-[[Aragonese language|Aragonese]] language in the historic [[Kingdom of Valencia]], as well as several [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] municipalities that were annexed to the Valencian Community in the 19th century. Valencian is traditionally spoken in the more densely populated coastal areas where Catalan settlers introduced their language in the [[Middle Ages]]. These areas are delimited for administrative purposes by the Generalitat, establishing different areas of linguistic predominance (''predomini lingüístic''). The area of Valencian linguistic predominance is undergoing in many cases a process of [[Language shift|linguistic substitution]], especially in the 2 largest cities of the community, [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] and [[Alicante]], where Spanish has become predominant in spite of Valencian being the traditional language. In addition, large numbers of foreign immigrants who have arrived since 2000 have become Spanish speakers. Outside the aforementioned cities, and the traditional Spanish-speaking areas in the west, Valencian predominates or is on an equal footing in the rest of the territory.

Most of the population have at least a passive knowledge of Valencian, which allows normal communication in this language across the Valencian Community. Thanks to its implementation in public administration and the education system in recent decades, knowledge of Valencian has increased phenomenally both in absolute and relative terms, most significantly in the case of its written standard. The source also reveals that knowledge varies greatly within the territory, with knowledge in the Province of Alicante being consistently lower than in Castellón and Valencia.

Despite the increase in knowledge of Valencian, its social use in relative terms is declining, with only a third of the population using it at home according to the Generalitat in 2010. The data collected varies greatly within the Valencian Community, with the percentage of use being over 50% in the regions of [[Alcoy, Spain|Alcoy]]–[[Gandia]] and [[Júcar]]–[[Turia (river)|Turia]], approximately 40% in [[Province of Castellón|Castellón]] and about 15% in [[Province of Alicante|Alicante]] and the [[Valencia]] metropolitan area.

=== Valencian language controversy ===
{{Main|Valencian language controversy}}Despite differences in dialect and denomination, linguists consider [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Valencian language|Valencian]] two varieties of the same language. They feature relative uniformity in terms of vocabulary, semantics, syntax, morphology and phonology. Mutual intelligibility ranges from 90 to 95%, which is considerably higher than between dialects of an assumed single [[German language]] (High German). Furthermore, there is a [[dialect continuum]] where speakers at the Catalania–Valencia border share the same dialect. In practice, Catalan and Valencian share the same written standard, as established by the [[Institut d'Estudis Catalans]] (IEC) and the [[Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua]] (AVL) respectively. Much of the bibliography used in the Valencian education system consists of Catalan works and translations in Catalan with only occasionally some words being swapped for those more commonly used in Valencia. Furthermore, the [[University of Valencia|Universities of Valencia]] and [[University of Alicante|Alicante]] refer to Valencian studies of language and literature as Catalan Philology.

In spite of these arguments, a significant proportion of the Valencian population refuse to identify Valencian with Catalan.

== Transports ==

=== Air ===
[[File:NAT-Aeropuerto-Alicante-(feb-2010).PNG|thumb|200px|New Alicante Terminal being built]]
The Valencian Community is served by three international airports: [[Alicante Airport]], [[Valencia Airport]] and [[Castellón–Costa Azahar Airport]]. [[Alicante Airport]], located in the south, is mainly tourist-oriented and is currently the busiest airport in the Valencian Community. [[Valencia Airport]] is located in the capital and carries more business traffic. The third airport, [[Castellón–Costa Azahar Airport]], is located in the north of the Valencian territory and has several international connections. This airport was opened in 2011 but its first commercial flight arrived in September 2015, so it has been considered as a [[white elephant]] due to its expensive construction and maintenance and relatively less usefulness.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Ortega |first=Lorena |url=https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2015/09/15/inenglish/1442315325_416141.html |title=First commercial flight lands at Castellón's former 'ghost' airport |date=15 September 2015 |work=El País}}</ref>

A new terminal at Alicante Airport was opened in March 2011. The New Alicante Terminal (NAT) replaced the other two existing terminals T1 and T2, doubling the passenger capacity of the airport to 20m passengers per annum. Valencia airport is also being expanded to serve the higher passenger demand due to new flight connections to the city.

=== Train ===
[[File:EstaciónAVEValenciaJoaquínSorolla.jpg|thumb|200px|Provisional station of Valencia]]
The Valencian Community has an extensive rail system which connects the principal cities with the rest of Spain such as the [[Euromed (train)|Euromed]] towards [[Catalonia]] and [[AVE]] towards [[Madrid]], or northern and southern Spain, both run by the Spanish national rail company [[RENFE]].

In December 2010 the [[high-speed rail]] ([[AVE]]) Madrid–Valencia opened as part of the [[Madrid–Levante high-speed rail line]]. High-speed lines arrive to [[Valencia-Joaquín Sorolla railway station|Valencia-Joaquín Sorolla]], a provisional station located south of the city centre. It is expected that in the coming years the high-speed line Madrid–Valencia will reach the main [[Estació del Nord (Valencia)|Valencia-Estació del Nord]] through a tunnel under the new [[:es:Valencia Parque Central|Valencia Parque Central]].

High-speed rail Madrid–Alicante opened in 2013.

There are some medium-range plans for further high-speed connections, like the Valencia–Bilbao link via [[Zaragoza]] or the [[:es:Corredor Mediterráneo|Mediterranean high-speed rail corridor]].

In addition, the [[Generalitat Valenciana]] has planned on building a regional high-speed rail along the coast to connect all major coastal cities like Valencia, Gandia, Dénia, Benidorm, Villajoyosa, Alicante and Torrevieja.

==== Commuter rail and Metro ====
[[File:TRAM Alicante MARQ-C.jpg|thumb|200px|Alicante light tram through the city centre]]
[[Cercanías]] (''Rodalia'' in Valencian) is the [[commuter rail]] service that serves all three provincial capitals of Valencia and their metropolitan areas. It is operated by [[Cercanías Renfe]], the commuter rail division of [[RENFE]].

While the Valencian-owned company, [[Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat Valenciana]] (FGV) operates a [[tram-train]] line between [[Alicante]], [[Benidorm]] and [[Dénia]]. It also operates the city [[tram]] and [[rapid transit|metro]] system of [[Valencia]] ([[Valencia Metro (Spain)|Valencia Metro]]) and [[Alicante]] ([[Alicante Tram]]). There is as well a third new tram and [[trolleybus]] system being built in [[Castellón de la Plana]] and its metropolitan area. Additionally both, Valencia metro and Alicante tram are being extended to serve uncovered areas, like the new tram line planned to open in the coming months towards the [[University of Alicante]] and [[San Vicente del Raspeig/Sant Vicent del Raspeig|Sant Vicent del Raspeig]].

=== Ports ===
{{Main|List of seaports of the Valencian Community}}
[[File:0.2. Port de Dénia.jpg|thumb|right|Port of [[Dénia]]]]
By sea, the Valencian Community is served by several ferry routes and cargo ports, and in the major cities, Valencia and Alicante, cruise ships dock on a regular basis.

In point 20 of article 149 of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Spanish Constitution]], referring to the exclusive powers of the State, direct reference is made to the ownership of the ports of [[Public interest|general interest]], which in the Valencian case are those of [[Port of Alicante|Alicante]], [[Port of Castellón|Castellón]], [[Port of Valencia|Valencia]], [[Port of Sagunto|Sagunt]] and [[Port of Gandía|Gandia]]. For this reason, all these ports are managed by the public body, dependent on the Ministry of Development. This body is in charge of executing the port policy of the [[Government of Spain|government]] and of coordinating and controlling the efficiency of the port system, made up of 28 Port Authorities that they administer the 46 [[port]]s of general interest of the State. There are 3 Port Authorities of the Valencian Community, which manage the 5 Valencian ports of general interest. Thus, the [[Port of Valencia|Port Authority of Valencia]] is in charge of managing the ports of Valencia, [[Port of Sagunto|Sagunt]] and [[Port of Gandia|Gandia]], while those of [[Port of Alicante|Alicante]] and [[Port of Castellón|Castellón]] only manage their reference port. In addition to the ports of general interest, there are also other ports, known as the ports of the Generalitat Valenciana. There are currently 35 ports dependent on the Generalitat, of which 16 are managed directly by the Generalitat, while the rest are managed from the private sector through concession. Some of the main ports managed by the Valencian Government are those of Altea, Benicarló, Benidorm, Borriana, Calp, Cullera, Dénia, Tabarca, Xàbia, Moraira, Peníscola, Santa Pola, Torrevieja, La Vila Joiosa, Vinaròs, etc. In the Valencian Community, the body entrusted with the responsibility of creating the necessary infrastructures that allow the development of the Valencian ports network is the Entity of the Transport and Ports Network of the Valencian Community, dependent on the Department of Infrastructure and Transport.<ref name="GTP">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gtp-gva.es/pagina.aspx?pagina=17 |page=17|title=Conozca GTP|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212102021/http://www.gtp-gva.es/pagina.aspx?pagina=17|archive-date=12 December 2013|access-date=12 December 2013}}</ref>

=== Education ===
{{main|Education in Spain}}
State Education in Spain and the Valencian Community is free and compulsory from six to sixteen years of age. The current education system is called LOE (in reference to the ''Llei Orgànica d'Educació'').<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mec.es/educa/sistema-educativo/loe/sistema-educativo-loe.html |title=Sistema Educativo LOE |website=Spanish Ministry of Education |language=es |trans-title=LOE Educational System |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311104143/http://www.mec.es/educa/sistema-educativo/loe/sistema-educativo-loe.html |archive-date=11 March 2007}}</ref>
*From three to six years: Preparatory School (''Infantil'', popularly known as ''Preescolar'')
*From six to twelve years: Primary School (''Primaria'')
*From twelve to sixteen years: Compulsory Secondary School (''Secundaria'')
*From sixteen to eighteen years: Post-Secondary School (''Bachillerato'')

Children from three to five years old in the Valencian Community have the option of attending the ''infantil'' or [[preschool|pre-school]] stage, which is non-compulsory and free for all students. It is regarded as an integral part of the education system with infantil classes in almost every primary school. There are some separate nursery schools.

Valencian students aged six to sixteen undergo [[primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]] education, which are compulsory and free of charge. Successful students are awarded a Secondary Education Certificate, which is necessary for entering further (optional) education as for their University or Vocational Studies. Once students have finished their ''Batxillerat'' (Spanish: ''Bachillerato''), they can take the PAU exams (''Proves d'Accés a la Universitat''), commonly known as ''Selectiu''.

The secondary stage of education is normally referred to by their initials, e.g. ''ESO'' standing for ''Educació Secundària Obligatòria''.

The Valencian Community is home to a number of prestigious universities like the [[University of Valencia]], founded in 1499. At the request of [[James I of Aragon]], [[Pope Innocent IV]] in 1246, authorized by a [[papal bull]] the establishment of ''estudis generals'' in Valencia. The University Statutes were passed by the municipal magistrates of Valencia on 30 April 1499; this is considered to be the 'founding' of the university.  In 1501, Pope [[Alexander VI]] signed the bill of approval and one year later [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] proclaimed the Royal Mandatory Concession. Only very meagre accounts have been preserved of the practical workings of the university. From the time of its foundation the courses included [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[philosophy]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[theology]], [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]], and [[medicine]].

Nowadays the [[Polytechnic University of Valencia]] has become one of the most prestigious universities in Spain, according to its technology, investigation, several degrees offering a close relation with some the most important universities in the world such as Cambridge, Oxford and Harvard. Most faculties and colleges are based in the city of Valencia, with some branches in [[Gandia]] and [[Alcoy, Spain|Alcoy]].

Other universities are [[University of Alicante]], [[Miguel Hernández University of Elche|Miguel Hernández University]] in Elche, [[Jaume I University]] and [[Valencian International University]] in Castellón de la Plana, [[Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr|Catholic University of Valencia]], and [[Universidad CEU Cardenal Herrera|CEU Cardenal Herrera University]] in Valencia.

=== Media ===
{{Main|Ràdio Televisió Valenciana|Valencian Media Corporation}}
[[File:RTVVexecutada.jpg|thumb|Employees demonstrate in front of the RTVV headquarters in [[Burjassot]] the day of its closure.]]
Until its dissolution in November 2013, the public-service Ràdio Televisió Valenciana (RTVV) was the main broadcaster of radio and television in the Valencian Community. The Generalitat Valenciana constituted it in 1984 in order to guarantee the [[freedom of information]] of the Valencian people in [[Valencian language|their own language]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ugtrtvv.net/cms/PDFS/MATERIALES/LleiCreacioRTVV.pdf |title=Ley de Creación de la Entidad Pública Radiotelevisión Valenciana (RTVV) |date=1984 |language=es |trans-title=Law on the Creation of the Public Entity Radiotelevisión Valenciana (RTVV) |via=UGT RTTV |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205125020/http://www.ugtrtvv.net/cms/PDFS/MATERIALES/LleiCreacioRTVV.pdf |archive-date=5 December 2013 |access-date=9 April 2015 }}</ref>

Prior to its dissolution, the administration of RTVV under the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP) had been controversial due to accusations of ideological manipulation and lack of plurality. The news broadcast was accused of giving marginal coverage of the [[Valencia Metro derailment]] in 2006 and the indictment of President de la Generalitat [[Francisco Camps]] in the [[Gürtel case|Gürtel]] scandal in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.vertele.com/video-articulo/los-escandalos-de-canal-9-rescatados-por-el-intermedio/ |title=Los escándalos de Canal 9 |date=7 November 2013 |website=VerteleTV |language=es |trans-title=The Channel 9 scandals |access-date=9 April 2015}}</ref> Supervisors appointed by the PP were accused of [[sexual harassment]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/3735055/20100528/sanz-destituit-secretari-general-rtvv-assetjament-sexual.html |title=Sanz, destituït de secretari general de RTVV per assetjament sexual |date=28 May 2010 |work=Vilaweb |access-date=9 April 2015 |language=ca |trans-title=Sanz, dismissed as RTVV's secretary general for sexual harassment}}</ref>

In face of an increasing debt and shrinking audiences that had fallen under 10 and even 5% of share in recent years, RTVV announced in 2012 a plan to shed 70% of its labour. The plan was nullified on 5 November 2013 by the [[National Court of Spain|National Court]] after trade unions appealed against it. On that same day, the President de la Generalitat [[Alberto Fabra]] announced RTVV would be closed, claiming that reinstating the employees was untenable.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Bono |first=Ferran |url=http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2013/11/05/valencia/1383648718_498928.html |title=El fracaso de Fabra acaba con el PP |date=7 November 2013 |work=El País |access-date=9 April 2015 |language=es |trans-title=Fabra's failure ends with RTVV}}</ref> On 27 November, the legislative assembly passed the dissolution of RTVV and employees organized to take control of the broadcast, starting a campaign against the PP. Nou TV's last broadcast ended abruptly when Spanish police pulled the plug at 12:19 on 29 November 2013.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25154669 |title=Police evict TV staff in Spain after closure of station |date=29 November 2013 |work=BBC News |access-date=9 April 2015}}</ref>

Having lost all revenues from advertisements and facing high costs from the termination of hundreds of contracts, critics question whether the closure of RTVV has improved the financial situation of the Generalitat, and point out to plans to benefit private-owned media.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.levante-emv.com/comunitat-valenciana/2014/06/19/coste-cierre-rtvv-asciende-144/1127465.html|title = El coste del cierre de RTVV asciende a 144,1 millones|date = 2014|access-date = 9 April 2015|website = Levante-EMV}}</ref> Currently, the availability of media in the Valencian language is extremely limited. All the other [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities in Spain]], including the monolingual ones, have public-service broadcasters, with the Valencian Community being the only exception despite being the fourth most populated.

In 2016 the renewed Valencian government announced that a new public media corporation was to be created. The [[Valencian Media Corporation]] was founded in July 2016, as it started the creation of a new TV channel and radio station, by the name of ''À Punt'' (ɑ̀). In June 2018 the new public TV channel was launched by Valencian Media Corporation, the newly formed agency of the [[Generalitat Valenciana]].

== Culture ==
=== Gastronomy ===
{{Main|Valencian cuisine}}[[File:03_paella_hirviendo_con_romero_cortado.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Valencian ''[[paella]]'']]

The Valencian gastronomy is of great variety, although their more international dishes are rice-based ({{lang|ca-valencia|arròs}} in Valencian), like the Valencian {{lang|ca-valencia|[[paella]]}} known worldwide. Rice is a basic ingredient in many of the typical dishes, like the ''[[arròs a banda]]'', ''[[arròs al forn]]'', ''[[arròs amb costra]]'', ''[[arròs caldós]]'', ''[[arròs del senyoret]]'', ''[[arròs negre]]'', among many.

[[Pasta]] dishes include the ''[[fideuà]]''. Its main ingredients are pasta noodles, fish and shellfish.

The Valencian Mediterranean climate favors the cultivation of vegetables and citrus fruits, with the cultivation of the [[orange (fruit)|orange]] ({{langx|ca-valencia|taronja|link=no}}) being perhaps of highest importance as one of the typical fruits of Valencian [[agriculture]].

{{lang|es|[[Horchata]]}} ({{lang|ca-valencia|orxata}} in Valencian), production of which has traditionally been centred around [[Alboraya]] (''Alboraia''), is a typical drink, accompanied with {{lang|ca-valencia|[[fartons]]}}. Also traditional are the production of coffee liqueur (typical of [[Alcoy, Spain|Alcoy]]), and {{lang|ca-valencia|[[mistela]]}} (in [[Marina Baixa]] and [[Hoya de Buñol]] (''Foia de Bunyol'')). Another one is {{lang|es|[[agua de Valencia]]}}, in Valencian {{lang|ca-valencia|aigua de València}}, it is a cocktail made from a base of cava or champagne, orange juice, vodka, and gin. In general, it is served in pitchers of various sizes and is drunk in a broad cocktail glass. It was made for the first time in 1959 by Constante Gil in the bar Café Madrid, in the city of [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]].

The great majority of [[dessert]]s typical of Valencia have their origin in Arabic times and play an important part in the local festive activities. Some <!-- what? desserts? activities? --> are internationally famous. [[Xixona]] is the place of traditional manufacture of {{lang|es|[[turrón]]}} ({{lang|ca-valencia|torró}} in Valencian), a soft nougat, consumed during Christmas in Spain and the rest of the Hispanic world. In [[Casinos, Valencia|Casinos]] the {{lang|es|turrón}} is typical too but the most important manufacture of the village is {{lang|es|peladillas}} or {{lang|ca-valencia|confit}} ([[dragée]]s and [[sugared almonds]]). In [[Xàtiva]] and the [[Central comarques of the Valencian Community|Central comarques]], the {{lang|ca-valencia|[[arnadí]]}}, a dessert elaborated with [[pumpkin]] is made. [[Orihuela]] and its region have the {{lang|es|[[almojábanas]]}}.

=== Valencian symbols ===
[[File:Escut- del País Valencià als Torres dels Serrans.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Coat of arms of the Valencian Community|Valencian coat of arms]] over the entrance of [[Torres de Serranos|Serranos Towers]]]]
[[File:Bandera de la ciutat de València (Senyera Coronada) a les Torres de Serrans.JPG|thumb|left|200px|''[[Flag of Valencia|Reial Senyera]]'', Valencian flag]]

The official Valencian anthem is the Hymn of the Regional Exhibition of 1909 (''[[Himne de l'Exposició|Himne de l'Exposició Regional de 1909]]'' in Valencian; commonly known as the ''Himne de València'', "Anthem of Valencia"), in whose composition the old hymn of the City of Valencia of the 16th century is included. The [[Coat of arms of the Valencian Community|emblem of the Valencian Generalitat]] (coat of arms) includes the heraldry of King [[Peter IV of Aragon]], representative of the historical [[Kingdom of Valencia]], whose shield is inclined towards the right, or, four bars Gules.

The official flag, the [[Flag of Valencia|Royal Senyera]] (''Reial Senyera''), also known as ''Senyera Coronada'' (Crowned Senyera) or ''Senyera Tricolor'' (Tricolour Senyera) is the same as Valencia's City flag, which, in turn, is a historical derivation of the ''[[Senyera]]'', the heraldic symbol of the [[Crown of Aragon]], also used today with few variations in all the former Kingdoms and Counties which were a part of this crown. There are also a number of Valencian private and civil entities such as trade unions,<ref>See logo of one of major trade unions: [http://www.pv.ccoo.es/ CCOO-PV]</ref> cultural associations,<ref>See usage of the ''Senyera'' by a Valencian cultural association: [http://www.acpv.net/php/index.php ACPV] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705235833/http://www.acpv.net/php/index.php |date=5 July 2007 }}</ref> or political parties<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928030226/http://www.acpv.net/php/noticia.php?id_noti=614 See usage] of ''Senyera'' by political parties [[United Left (Spain)|EUPV]], [[Bloc Nacionalista Valencià]], Green Parties, amongst others, whose combined participation in the Autonomous Elections of 2007 achieved 9% of the total votes.</ref> which simply use the ''Senyera'' as Valencian flag.

Other symbols are used at different levels by the Valencian society, like the heraldic animals of ''rat-penat'' (a [[bat]]) and ''drac alat'' (a winged [[dragon]] which was the emblem of [[James I of Aragon|James I]]).

One of the most recognized and representative Valencian symbols are the music and dance of the ''[[Muixeranga]]'', ancient tradition of human towers preserved for the last 4 centuries, during the Festivity of ''[[La Mare de Déu de la Salut Festival]]'' of [[Algemesí]], recognized-UNESCO "intangible heritage of humanity". Typical folk music in celebrations is played with the ''[[tabor (instrument)|tabalet]]'' (a drum) and the ''[[dolçaina]]'' (a flute). Valencian traditional costumes and dresses include ''[[espadrille|espardenyes]]'' (shoes) and traditional ''[[falles|fallera]]'' dresses (the Falles dresses).

The [[wiktionary:autochthonous|autochthonous]] Valencian sport is the [[Valencian pilota]], which features a professional [[Valencian Pilota Squad]] for international matches with related [[ball game]]s all around the world. This sport has many variants, that may be played at the streets or at special courtfields like the [[Valencian trinquet|trinquet]]. It may also be played by teams or on individual challenges. An amazing trait of this sport is that spectators may sit very close or even in the middle of the court. Even while the match is ongoing [[bookmaker]]s take bets for ''reds'' or ''blues'', since these are the colours players must wear, red being the colour of the strongest team or player. The ''Valencian pilota'' can be traced to the 15th century, but it was abandoned during modern times, this decadence is being fought back with TV broadcasts, new built colleges have courtfields and a new professional players firm, [[ValNet]]

[[Association football]] is the most widely known and played sport. There are teams in every town or village, two of which are currently playing in [[La Liga]], Spanish top professional division: [[Valencia CF]] (widely considered one of the most successful clubs in Spanish football history, having won six La Liga titles and 8 Copa del Rey) and [[Villarreal CF]]. There are two clubs playing in the [[Segunda División]], [[Levante UD]] and [[Elche CF]]. Other historical teams that have been in La Liga in the past are [[CD Alcoyano]], [[Hércules CF]] and [[CD Castellón]].

Professional [[basketball]] is represented currently in [[Liga ACB]], the top professional division, by [[Valencia Basket]], who won its first league title in 2017. Two more teams, [[CB Lucentum Alicante]] and [[AB Castelló]] are present in the second division.

Regarding female professional sports, the historical [[BM Sagunto]], now disbanded, dominated the women's professional [[handball]] scene in Spain through the 1980s and 1990s, with a total of 27 [[División de Honor Femenina de Balonmano|Spanish Division of Honour - Women's handball]] wins, 20 Cup titles and 1 [[Women's EHF Champions League]]. Other important women's handball teams are [[CB Amadeo Tortajada]] (dissolved in 2009), [[CBF Elda]], [[CB Mar Alicante]] and [[CB Elche]]. In female basketball, [[Ros Casares Valencia]] has been 8 times champion of the [[Liga Femenina de Baloncesto|Spanish Women's League]] and 3 times winner of the [[EuroLeague Women]].

[[Motorcycle sport|Motorcycle races]] are very popular, as the [[Circuit Ricardo Tormo|Circuit of Valencia]] race track and its hosted [[Valencian Community motorcycle Grand Prix|Valencian Community Grand Prix]] prove. Many Valencian [[MotoGP]] pilots such as [[Héctor Barberá]], [[Héctor Faubel]] or [[Nicolás Terol]] have been competing in different MotoGP classes.

In early February, the annual cycling stage race [[Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana]], which dates back to 1929, is held as the first stage race of the European season.<ref>https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/vuelta-a-la-comunidad-valenciana</ref>

Another relevant game is the [[pigeon sport]], with an autochthonous [[dove]] race being trained, the ''[[gavatxut valencià]]''.

[[Pétanque|Petanca]] and its variant ''[[Calitx]]'' are traditional sports as well, especially in towns or among elders.
