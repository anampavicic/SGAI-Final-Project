'''Kitchener''' is a city in the Canadian province of [[Ontario]], about {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Toronto]]. It is one of three cities that make up the [[Regional Municipality of Waterloo]] and is the regional [[Administrative centre|seat]]. Kitchener was known as '''Berlin''' until a [[Berlin to Kitchener name change|1916 referendum]] changed its name. The city covers an area of 136.86&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, and had a population of 256,885 at the time of the [[2021 Canadian census]].

The Regional Municipality of Waterloo has 673,910 people as of year-end 2023,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/regional-government/population.aspx | title=Population | date=8 May 2018 }}</ref> making it the 10th-largest [[census metropolitan area]] (CMA) in Canada and the fourth-largest CMA in Ontario. Kitchener and Waterloo are considered "twin cities", which are often referred to jointly as "Kitchener–Waterloo" (K–W), although they have separate [[Municipal government in Canada|municipal governments]].

==History<span class="anchor" id="History"></span>==

===Pre-contact indigenous history and land use===

Indigenous people have long lived in and around what is today Kitchener-Waterloo. During the retreat of the last glacial maximum, the Waterloo Region was isolated by the ice to the north, east, and west and by Lake Maumee III to the south,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Regional Municipality of Waterloo |title=Archaeological Facilities Master Plan |url=https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/exploring-the-region/resources/Documents/ARCHAEOLOGICAL_MASTER_PLAN.pdf |publisher=Regional Municipality of Waterloo |access-date=6 November 2023 |pages=109 |language=English |date=September 1989}}</ref> however once the ice retreated the landscape opened up for nomadic populations to hunt, camp, and thrive; though not many sites from the Paleo-Indian Period (13,000BC to 1000BC) have been documented in the region thus far.

The Archaic Period (8,000BC to 800BC) still primarily consisted of nomadic hunter-gatherer communities spread out across the landscape. Advancements in technologies including less portable stone tools such as axes and adzes, more intricate tools made of animal bone such as fish hooks, gorges, and harpoons, and the entrance of Indigenous copper tools into the archaeological record is characteristic of this time period. More than two dozen archaeological sites from the Archaic Period have been documented in the Waterloo Region alone including campsites, tool manufacturing sites, and cemeteries.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Regional Municipality of Waterloo |title=Archaeological Facilities Master Plan |url=https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/exploring-the-region/resources/Documents/ARCHAEOLOGICAL_MASTER_PLAN.pdf |publisher=Regional Municipality of Waterloo |access-date=6 November 2023 |pages=109 |language=English |date=September 1989}}</ref>

Archaeologist Gary Warrick of Wilfrid Laurier University dates the expansion of the [[Neutral people]] to the Kitchener-Waterloo area sometime in the 1300s in what is referred to as the Woodland Period (900BC to 1650AD).<ref>{{cite book |first=Warrick |last=Gary |year=2013 |chapter=The Aboriginal Population of Ontario in Late Prehistory |title=Before Ontario: The Archaeology of a Province |editor-last1=Munson |editor-first1=Marit K. |editor-last2=Jamieson |editor-first2=Susan M. |publisher=[[McGill-Queen's University Press]] |series=Native and Northern Series |isbn=978-0-7735-8919-3 |page=69}}</ref> A history states that at least two "aboriginal settlements from the 1500s can now be identified near Schneider and Strasburg Creeks" with some artifacts having been found under the city from a thousand years ago. The Iroquoian people grew crops such as corn, beans and squash.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theworkingcentre.org/ideas-and-influences/2696-remembering-our-underlying-aboriginal-heritage|title=Remembering Our Underlying Aboriginal Heritage |access-date=29 March 2021}}</ref> The finds include the remains of a First Nations village, estimated to be 500 years old, discovered in 2010 in the Strasburg Creek area of Kitchener. The inhabitants are thought to be ancestors of the [[Neutral Nation]]; artifacts found include the remains of longhouses, tools made of bone and of stone and arrowheads. One archaeologist stated that they discovered "artifacts going back as far as 9,000 years".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/major-archaeological-find-unearthed-in-kitchener-1.566066|title=Archeological Find Unearthed in Kitchener|date=22 October 2010|access-date=29 March 2021}}</ref>

In 2020, a site at Fischer-Hallman Road was found to include artifacts from a "Late Woodland Iroquois village" that was inhabited circa 1300 to 1600. Archeologists found some 35,000 objects including stone tools and a 4,000 year old arrowhead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/remnants-iroquois-woodland-village-discovered-ontario-180976099/|title=Remnants of Woodland Iroquois Village Discovered in Ontario|access-date=29 March 2021}}</ref>

To date, there are more than 18 Late-Woodland Period village sites documented in the Waterloo Region.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Regional Municipality of Waterloo |title=Archaeological Facilities Master Plan |url=https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/exploring-the-region/resources/Documents/ARCHAEOLOGICAL_MASTER_PLAN.pdf |publisher=Regional Municipality of Waterloo |access-date=6 November 2023 |pages=109 |language=English |date=September 1989}}</ref>

====German company tract====
Kitchener stands on a part of the [[Haldimand Tract]], lands in the Grand River valley purchased in 1784 by the British from the [[Mississaugas]] in order to grant it to the [[Iroquois|Six Nations]] for their allegiance during the [[American Revolution]].<ref name=encyclopedia>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Haldimand Proclamation |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |date=November 10, 2020 |last=Filice |first=Michelle |publisher=[[Historica Canada]] |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/haldimand-proclamation |access-date=June 9, 2021}}</ref> Between 1796 and 1798, the Six Nations sold 38,000 hectares of this land to [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]] Colonel [[Richard Beasley (politician)|Richard Beasley]].  The portion of land that Beasley purchased was remote, but of great interest to German [[Mennonite]] farming families from [[Pennsylvania]]. They wanted to live in an area that would allow them to practice their beliefs without persecution. Eventually, the Mennonites purchased all of Beasley's unsold land, creating 160 farm tracts.

Many of the pioneers arriving from Pennsylvania, known as the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] or Pennsilfaanisch-Deitsche (Deutsch; German-speaking mainly from Switzerland and the Palatinate, not modern Dutch), after November 1803 bought land in a 60,000-acre section of Block Two from the German Company, which was established by a group of Mennonites from [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]]. The tract included most of Block 2 of the previous Grand River Indian lands. Many of the first farms were least 400 acres in size.<ref name="whs pdf 1">{{cite web |url=http://www.whs.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1930.pdf |title=History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=1930 |website=Waterloo Historical Society 1930 Annual Meeting |publisher=Waterloo Historical Society |access-date=13 March 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227233215/http://www.whs.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1930.pdf |archive-date=27 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name="kitchener.foundlocally.com">{{cite web |url=http://kitchener.foundlocally.com/Local/Info-CityHistoryToConfederation.htm |title=Kitchener–Waterloo Ontario History – To Confederation |access-date=2017-08-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525125004/http://kitchener.foundlocally.com/Local/Info-CityHistoryToConfederation.htm |archive-date=25 May 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The German Company, represented by Daniel Erb and Samuel Bricker, had acquired the land from previous owner Richard Beasley; he had gotten into financial difficulties after buying the land in 1796 from Joseph Brant, who represented the Six Nations.

Subsequently, Beasley sold a 60,000 acre tract of land to the German Company of Pennsylvania represented by Daniel Erb and Samuel Bricker in November 1803. Beasley's sale to the German Company not only cleared him of a mortgage debt, but left him with 10,000 acres of Block Two land, which he continued to sell into the 1830s. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227143026/http://www.waterlooregionmuseum.com/collections-and-research/place-names-in-waterloo-region/waterloo-township/ |archive-date=27 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kitchener.ca/en/resourcesGeneral/Documents/DSD_PLAN-Schoerg-Barn.pdf|title=Schoerg farmstead: first permanent European settlement Two families from Franklin County, Pennsylvania, bought land along the Grand River from m Beasley, establishing the first permanent European settlement in inland Upper Canada|access-date=29 March 2021}}{{Dead link|date=May 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In 1816, the government of Upper Canada designated the settlement the Township of Waterloo.

Much of the land, made up of [[moraine]]s and swampland interspersed with rivers and streams, was converted to farmland and roads. [[Rock Pigeon|Wild pigeons]], which once swarmed by the tens of thousands, were driven from the area. Apple trees were introduced to the region by John Eby in the 1830s, and several [[gristmill]]s and [[saw mill|sawmills]] were erected throughout the area, most notably Joseph Schneider's 1816 sawmill, John and [[Abraham Erb]]'s grist- and sawmills, Jacob Shantz's sawmill,<ref name=early-mills>{{cite news |url=https://www.therecord.com/life/2019/02/22/flash-from-the-past-early-mills-of-berlin-kitchener.html |title=Flash From the Past: Early mills of Berlin/Kitchener |first=Rych |last=Mills|date=22 February 2019 |orig-date=Updated 13 April 2020 |newspaper=[[Waterloo Region Record]]}}</ref> and Eby's cider mill. Schneider built Berlin's first road, from his home to the corner of King Street and Queen Street (then known as Walper Corner). The settlers raised $1,000 to extend the road from Walper Corner to Huether Corner, where the Huether Brewery was built and the [[Huether Hotel]] now stands in the city of Waterloo; a petition to the government for $100 to assist in completing the project was denied.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}

====Settlement before Ebytown (1804–1806)====

Members of the Eby family, most notably [[Benjamin Eby]], began migrating to the German Company Tract lands in the first decade of the 19th century. The Ebys were an old [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[Mennonite]] family with an association with religious non-conformist movements in Europe going back possibly as far as the [[Middle Ages]], and who were early followers of [[Anabaptism]].<ref name=eby-family />{{rp|3}} Jacob Eby, an ancestor of the Ebys who migrated to Upper Canada, was a Mennonite bishop in the Swiss canton of [[Zürich]] in 1683.<ref name=eby-family>{{cite book |last=Eby |first=Ezra E. |date=1889 |title=A Biographical History of the Eby Family |location=Berlin, Ontario |publisher=Hett & Eby |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924029840695}}</ref>{{rp|4}} The family first migrated to [[Palatinate (region)|the Palatinate]], then to [[Pennsylvania]], settling in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]]. In Lancaster County, members of the family, such as Peter Eby (1765–1843), continued to act as Mennonite religious leaders.<ref name=eby-family />{{rp|10–12}} The Ebys became involved in early land settlement of the German Company Tract, with a number arriving between 1804 and 1807 and taking up farming plots.

Two brothers, George and Samuel ("Indian Sam") Eby, arrived in 1804 and settled on Lot 1 of the German Company Tract, near the area of what would become downtown Kitchener.<ref name=ebybook />{{rp|587}} George Eby's farmstead was located one mile southeast from the future Berlin town core.<ref name=ebybook>{{cite book |last=Eby |first=Ezra E. |date=1895 |title=A biographical history of Waterloo township and other townships of the county |location=Berlin, Ontario |isbn=9780665100192 |url=https://archive.org/details/cihm_10019}}</ref>{{rp|31}} It was later owned by [[Jacob Yost Shantz]], who built a large farmhouse there in 1856 at what became the corner of Maurice and Ottawa Streets.<ref>{{cite web |last=Steiner |first=Sam |title=Jacob Y.

====Ebytown to Berlin (1806–1852)<span class="anchor" id="Ebytown"></span>====

Later named the founder of Berlin, [[Benjamin Eby]] (made Mennonite preacher in 1809, and bishop in 1812) arrived from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, in 1806, and purchased a large tract of land consisting of much of what would become the village of Berlin, so named in 1833). The settlement was initially called Ebytown, and was at the south-east side of what later became Queen Street. Eby was also responsible for the growth of the Mennonite church in Waterloo County.<ref name="whs pdf 1"/><ref>[http://www.waynecook.com/awaterloo.html Plaque 21] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312051921/http://www.waynecook.com/awaterloo.html |date=12 March 2017 }}</ref> By 1811, Eby had built a log Mennonite meeting house first used as a school house, but later also housing religious services. A new meeting house, known as Eby's Versammlungshaus, near Stirling Avenue, replaced the log house in 1834, while a schoolhouse was built on Frederick Street about the same time.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.therecord.com/living-story/7022105--benchi-bishop-benjamin-eby-was-a-builder-and-berlin-booster/ |title='Benchi' – Bishop Benjamin Eby was a builder and Berlin booster |date=17 December 2016 |first=Rych |last=Mills |work=Waterloo Region Record |access-date=2017-06-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328004435/https://www.therecord.com/living-story/7022105--benchi-bishop-benjamin-eby-was-a-builder-and-berlin-booster/ |archive-date=28 March 2018 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Benjamin Eby encouraged manufacturers and craftsmen to relocate to Ebytown. Jacob Hoffman came in 1829 or 1830, and started the first furniture factory. John Eby, druggist and chemist, arrived from Pennsylvania in about 1820, and opened a shop to the west of what would later be Eby Street.

The village centre of Ebytown was established in 1830 by Phineas Varnum, who leased land from Joseph Schneider and opened a blacksmith shop on the site where a hotel would be built many years later, the Walper House. A tavern was also established here at the same time, and a store was opened.<ref name="whs pdf 1"/> At the time, the settlement of Ebytown was still considered to be a [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]].<ref name="kitchener.foundlocally.com"/>

[[Friedrich Gaukel]], another prominent early local figure, purchased the Varnum tavern site in the early 1830s, along with other lands around the growing village. In a November 1833 transaction, he purchased lands located along the village's main street (later known as King Street) from Joseph Schneider. The deeds of sale for this transaction are the earliest recorded use of the name Berlin to refer to the community.<ref>{{Cite DCB |last=Wust |first=Klaus |title=GAUKEL, FRIEDRICH |volume=8 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/gaukel_friedrich_8E.html}}</ref>

The [[1826–1837 cholera pandemic]] affected Bridgeport in 1832 and Berlin in 1834. [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], then a significant port of entry for immigrants to Canada, was linked to the 1832 outbreak, which also affected other nearby settlements such as Guelph and Brantford. At Bridgeport, two English families who had recently arrived from [[Suffolk]] contracted the disease after passing through Hamilton, and several died after arriving at the community. They also spread it to an already-settled family, the Hemblings, a number of whom also died, including adults. Orphaned children from these families were later adopted by local Mennonites.<ref>{{cite report |last=Burtt |first=Bob |chapter=Three Ring Circus of Death |title=Waterloo Historical Society Annual Report |location=Kitchener, Ontario |publisher=Waterloo Historical Society |volume=100 |date=April 2013}}</ref>{{rp|190}}

The ''Smith's Canadian Gazetteer'' of 1846 describes Berlin as: "... contains about 400 inhabitants, who are principally Germans. A newspaper is printed here, called [[Der Deutsche Canadier|the "''German Canadian''"]] and there is a Lutheran meeting house. Post Office, post twice a-week.

The first cemetery in the city was the one next to Pioneer Tower in Doon; the first recorded burial at that location was in 1806.

====County seat (1853)====
[[File:Waterloo County Jail and Governor's House.jpg|thumb|Waterloo County Jail and Governor's House, Kitchener, built 1852]]

Previously part of the United County of Waterloo, Wellington, and Grey, Waterloo became a separate entity in 1853 with Berlin as [[county seat]]. Some contentious debate had existed between Galt and Berlin as to where the seat would be located; one of the requirements for founding was the construction of a [[courthouse]] and jail. When local merchant Joseph Gaukel donated a small parcel of land he owned (at the current Queen and [[Weber Street]]s), this sealed the deal for Berlin, which was still a small community compared to Galt. The courthouse at the corner of the later Queen Street North and Weber Street and the [[Waterloo County Gaol|gaol]] were built within a few months. The first county council meeting was held in the new facility on 24 January 1853, as the county officially began operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.guelphmercury.com/living-story/7420397-flash-from-the-past-seven-meetings-that-decided-waterloo-county/|title=Flash from the Past: Seven meetings that decided Waterloo County|first=Rych|last=Mills|date=July 14, 2017|website=Therecord.com|access-date=November 14, 2020}}</ref><ref name="hist places 1">{{cite web |url= http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=9216 |title= Waterloo County Jail and Governor's House |author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website= Canada's Historic Places |access-date= July 1, 2015 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150713055721/http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=9216 |archive-date= 13 July 2015 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>

====Arrival of the railways====

The extension of the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] from Sarnia to Toronto (and hence through Berlin) in July 1856 was a major boon to the community, helping to improve industrialization in the area.  Immigrants from Germany, mostly Lutheran and Catholic, dominated the city after 1850, and developed their own newer German celebrations and influences, such as the [[Turners|Turner societies]], gymnastics, and band music.<ref name="kitchener.ca">[http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/aboutkitchener.asp About Kitchener] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206203014/http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/AboutKitchener.asp |date=6 February 2017 }}</ref> In 1869, Berlin had a population of 3000.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/provinceontario00mcevgoog#page/n66/mode/2up |title=The Province of Ontario Gazetteer and Directory |first=Henry |last=McEvoy |date=1869 |publisher=Robertson and Cook |oclc=8348177 |isbn=9780665094125 |page=54}}</ref>

In the late 1880s, the idea of a [[street railway]] connection to Waterloo was promoted, resulting in the construction of the [[Berlin and Waterloo Street Railway]] in 1888.<ref name=elso-kwsr>{{cite web |url=http://www.trainweb.org/elso/kw_st_ry.htm |title=Kitchener & Waterloo Street Railway |website=Electric Lines in Southern Ontario |first=William E. |last=Miller |date=4 February 2007 |access-date=15 March 2021}}</ref> It was electrified in 1895, making it the first [[electric railway]] in Berlin, though not the first in the county, as the [[Galt and Preston Street Railway]] had opened with electric operation in 1894.

[[File:Wellington County House of Industry and Refuge National Historic Site of Canada, Between Elora and Fergus, Wellington Centre, Ontario (21652033238).jpg|thumb|The House of Industry and Refuge in nearby Wellington County has been preserved as a National Historic Site.]]

In 1869, the county government built a very large so-called [[poorhouse]] with an attached farm, the House of Industry and Refuge that accommodated some 3,200 people before being closed in 1951; the building was later demolished. It was on Frederick St. in Kitchener, behind the now Frederick Street Mall, and was intended to minimize the number of people begging, living on the streets, or being incarcerated at a time before social-welfare programmes. A 2009 report by the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' explains, "pauperism was considered a moral failing that could be erased through order and hard work".<ref>{{cite news |last=Tyler |first=Tracey |date=January 3, 2009 |title=When 'poorhouse' wasn't only an expression |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/2009/01/03/when_poorhouse_wasnt_only_an_expression.html |work=Toronto Star |location=Toronto |access-date=March 13, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314153422/https://www.thestar.com/news/2009/01/03/when_poorhouse_wasnt_only_an_expression.html |archive-date=14 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

On 9 June 1912, Berlin was designated a city.<ref name="kitchener.ca"/> At this time, the City Hall was in the two-story building at King and Frederick Streets that had also been used as the Berlin town hall, completed in 1869 by builder [[Jacob Yost Shantz|Jacob Y.

Kitchener was in many cases within Ontario the earliest adopter, or one of the earliest adopters, of many municipal institutions which later became commonplace. These institutions included library boards, planning boards, and conservation authorities. Known collectively as the agencies, boards, and commissions (or ABCs), these special-purpose bodies became a characteristic element of Canadian governance.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lucas |first=Jack |date=2013 |title=Hidden in Plain View: Local Agencies, Boards, and Commissions in Canada |journal=IMFG Perspectives |publisher=Institute on Municipal Finance and Governance |number=4 |url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/82711/1/imfg_perspectives_4_hidden_in_plain_view_lucas_2013.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/82711/1/imfg_perspectives_4_hidden_in_plain_view_lucas_2013.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live}}</ref>{{rp|2}} The ABCs movement in Kitchener began in the 1890s with the passage of the 1894 ''Public Parks Act'' transferring management of the town's parkland from a committee of the town council to a parks board, an initiative which ultimately led to the creation of [[Victoria Park, Kitchener|Victoria Park]].

Berlin's character had been predominantly German since Waterloo Township's settlement by [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] pioneers in the early 19th century, and its urban growth and industrialization was bolstered in large part by Germans and other peoples from [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], who brought with them skills, tools, and machinery, as well as diverse religious and social customs. The outbreak of the [[First World War]] pitted the [[British Empire]] (and by extension, Canada) against the [[German Empire|German]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires, and led to a wave of suspicion, exclusion, and discriminatory measures against people whose ethnic origins were associated with these states. Thousands of [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainians]], Germans, [[Turkish people|Turks]], and [[Bulgarian people|Bulgarians]] were forcibly placed into internment camps by the Dominion government under the ''[[War Measures Act]]'', which was passed in August 1914. Internees had their property confiscated and many of them were subjected to [[forced labour]].

===German culture===
{{see also|Berlin-to-Kitchener name change}}

Of the cities that are now part of Waterloo Region, Berlin, now Kitchener, has the strongest German heritage because of the high levels of settlement in this area by German-speaking immigrants.

While those from Pennsylvania were the most numerous until about 1840, a few Germans from Europe began arriving in 1819, including Fredrick Gaukel, a hotel keeper, being one of the first. He built what later became the Walper House in Berlin. Two streets in present-day Kitchener, Frederick and Gaukel Streets, are named after him. Other German-speaking immigrants from Europe arrived during the 1830s to 1850s, bringing with them their language, religion, and cultural traditions. The German community became industrial and political leaders, and created a German-Canadian society unlike any other found in Canada at the time. They established German public schools and German-language churches.

Both the immigrants from Germany and the Mennonites from Pennsylvania spoke German, though with different dialects such as Low German or the incorrectly called [[Pennsylvania Dutch]], actually Pennsilfaanisch ''Deitsch'' (German, not modern Dutch).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianmennonite.org/stories/10-things-know-about-mennonites-canada|title=10 things to know about Mennonites in Canada|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314064249/http://www.canadianmennonite.org/stories/10-things-know-about-mennonites-canada|archive-date=14 March 2017|df=dmy-all|access-date=23 March 2017}}</ref> (This dialect is different from [[Standard German]] with a simplified grammatical structure, some differences in vocabulary and pronunciation and a greater influence of English.)

Immigration from continental Germany slowed by 1880. First and second-generation descendants now comprised most of the local German population, and while they were proud of their German roots, most considered themselves loyal British subjects. The 1911 Census indicates that of the 15,196 residents in Berlin, Ontario, about 70% were identified as ethnic German but only 8.3% had been born in Germany. By the beginning of the First World War in 1914, Berlin and Waterloo County were still considered to be predominantly German by people across Canada. This would prove to have a profound impact on local citizens during the war years. During the first few months of the war, services and activities at Lutheran churches in Waterloo County continued. As anti-German sentiment increased throughout Waterloo County, many of the churches decided to stop holding services in German.<ref name="auto2">"City on Edge: Berlin Becomes Kitchener in 1916" Exhibit at Waterloo Region Museum, on display 2016.</ref>

The governor general of Canada, the [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Duke of Connaught]], while visiting Berlin, Ontario, in May 1914, discussed the importance of [[Canadians of German ethnicity]] (regardless of their origin) in a speech: "It is of great interest to me that many of the citizens of Berlin are of German descent. I well know the admirable qualities – the thoroughness, the tenacity, and the loyalty of the great Teutonic Race, to which I am so closely related. I am sure that these inherited qualities will go far in the making of good Canadians and loyal citizens of the British Empire".<ref name="auto2"/>

===Suburban development (20th century)===

[[File:Queen Street South, Kitchener, Ontario looking North to King Street.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Queen Street South, looking north to King Street]]

The interwar and postwar periods saw a wave of suburban development around the city. One prominent example of this was the Westmount neighbourhood. Modelled after [[Westmount, Quebec|the affluent Montreal suburb of the same name]],<ref name=mavor>{{cite book |last=Mavor |first=Susan Saunders |date=2011 |title=Westmount: The Tie That Binds the Twin Cities |publisher=University of Waterloo Library |isbn=9780920834503}}</ref>{{rp|21–22}} it was developed on the forested hills to the north of the Schneider farmstead on lands that were subdivided from it.<ref name=mavor />{{rp|23}} Kitchener's Westmount took a number of its street names from the model subdivision in Montreal, such as Belmont Avenue.<ref name=mavor />{{rp|23}} It was the brainchild of a local rubber magnate, Talmon Henry Rieder, who was heavily connected to Montreal business interests and who oversaw the 1912 construction of the [[Dominion Tire Plant]] on nearby Strange Street.<ref name=mavor />{{rp|22}} Rieder was inspired by the turn-of-the-century [[City Beautiful movement]], which was focused in large part on construction of monumental civic architecture and urban beautification; it is often associated with [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] in North America.

Rieder's own interpretation of the movement's philosophy followed a variation of the influential landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]'s "Suburb Beautiful", with Rieder proclaiming Westmount the "Development Beautiful". It reflected an alienation from industrial cities and dense urban centres, driven by a variety of factors. These included concerns around the health impact of air pollution and desire for "country air";<ref name=mavor />{{rp|32}} the ability for people to commute longer distances being enabled by motor vehicles;<ref name=mavor />{{rp|35}} the availability of large, cheap plots of development land;<ref name=mavor />{{rp|35}} an increasing emphasis on the "restricted residential subdivision"<ref name=mavor />{{rp|36}} and [[restrictive covenants]] barring industrial and commercial development in exclusive residential neighbourhoods (an antecedent to modern [[zoning]]); and a desire by Berlin-turned-Kitchener's ethnically German business class, in the wake of the city's turmoil over its German identity during the First World War, to distance themselves from its 19th century past and the downtown area associated with it in favour of a built environment similar to wealthy Anglo-Canadians in other Canadian cities, such as Montreal and Winnipeg.<ref name=mavor />{{rp|41}} The fortunes of Rieder and other rubber industrialists were linked to the rise of the automobile industry in Canada,<ref name=mavor />{{rp|33}} and indirectly to the growth of automobile-linked suburbs. Lands formerly in the rural Waterloo Township were annexed to the city, ensuring suburban access to municipal services.<ref name=mavor />{{rp|27}} Westmount's planners distinguished the suburb from Kitchener's urban core in fundamental ways, such as the adoption of wandering, curvilinear roads combined with a more traditionally urban grid pattern.<ref name=mavor />{{rp|32}} Many streets were originally intended to be wide [[boulevard]]s, with some, such as Union Boulevard, planned to be as wide as {{convert|80|ft|m}}.<ref name=mavor />{{rp|32}} Winding streets and picturesque vistas were a significant part of advertising for the subdivision.<ref name=mavor />{{rp|35}}

==Government==
[[File:WaterlooRegionHQ-Frederick.JPG|thumb|Region of Waterloo Headquarters in Kitchener]]
Kitchener is governed by a council of ten councillors, representing [[Ward (politics)|wards]] (or
districts), and a mayor.<ref name="kitchener1">{{cite web|url=http://www.kitchener.ca/en/insidecityhall/WhoIsMyCouncillor.asp|title=Who is My Councillor? – City of Kitchener|publisher=City of Kitchener|access-date=5 September 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917165154/http://www.kitchener.ca/en/insidecityhall/WhoIsMyCouncillor.asp|archive-date=17 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Council is responsible for policy and decision making, monitoring the operation and performance of the city, analyzing and approving budgets and determining spending priorities. The residents of each ward vote for one person to be their city councillor; their voice and representative on city council. Municipal elections are held every four years in late October.

Kitchener was part of [[Waterloo County, Ontario|Waterloo County]] until 1973 when amalgamation created the [[Waterloo Regional Municipality, Ontario|Regional Municipality of Waterloo]]. The region handles many services, including fire, police, waste management, community health, transit, recreation, planning, roads and social services.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/newslist/index.aspx?corpId=58cynQlfgqiAYQyTLmpurQeQuAleQuAl&newsId=QXgUIE1G6huJ6eu741OyPlUsgeQuAleQuAl |title=Get to Know Us During Local Government Week |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=10 October 2012 |website=Waterloo Region |access-date=23 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322030411/http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/newslist/index.aspx?corpId=58cynQlfgqiAYQyTLmpurQeQuAleQuAl&newsId=QXgUIE1G6huJ6eu741OyPlUsgeQuAleQuAl |archive-date=22 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Kitchener residents elect four councillors at large to sit with the mayor on the Regional council.

The mayor of Kitchener is [[Berry Vrbanovic]], who was elected to his first term in October 2014. See [[Kitchener City Council]] for a complete list of councillors.

In 1976, residents of Kitchener voted almost 2:1 in favour of a ward system. The first municipal election held under the ward system occurred in 1978. In 2010, the city underwent a ward boundary review. A consultant proposed boundaries for a 10-ward system for the 2010 municipal election, adding 4 additional councillors and wards to replace the previous 6-ward system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kitchener.ca/city_hall/ward_boundary_review_background.html |title=City of Kitchener |publisher=Kitchener.ca |access-date=3 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706184420/http://www.kitchener.ca/city_hall/ward_boundary_review_background.html |archive-date=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Geography and climate==

===Geography===
Kitchener is located in [[Southwestern Ontario]], in the [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands]]. This geological and climatic region has wet-climate soils and deciduous forests. Situated in the Grand River Valley, the area is generally above {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} in elevation.

Kitchener is the largest city in the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] watershed and the [[Haldimand Tract]]. Just to the west of the city is [[Baden Hill]], in [[Wilmot, Ontario|Wilmot Township]]. This glacial [[kame]] remnant formation is the highest elevation for many miles. The other dominant glacial feature is the [[Waterloo Moraine]], which snakes its way through the region, and holds a significant quantity of [[artesian wells]], from which the city derives most of its drinking water. The settlement's first name, Sandhills, is an accurate description of the higher points of the moraine.

===Climate===
Kitchener has a [[humid continental climate]] of the warm summer subtype (''Dfb'' under the [[Köppen climate classification]]);  large seasonal differences are seen, usually warm and humid summers and cold to occasionally very cold winters. Winter-like conditions generally last from mid-December until mid-March, while summer temperatures generally occur from mid-May to close to the end of September.

March 2012 went down in the history books for Kitchener – between 16 and 22 March, temperatures ranged from {{convert|21.4|C|F|1}} to {{convert|26.5|C|F|1}}—7 record highs in a row. 19 March high of {{convert|24|C|F|1}} is one of the highest winter temperatures ever recorded, while 22 March high of {{convert|26.5|C|F|1}} is the highest for March in this area.

Temperatures during the year can exceed {{convert|30|C|F|1}} in the summer and drop below {{convert|-20|C|F|1}} in the winter several times a year, but prolonged periods of extreme temperatures are rare.  The frost-free period for Kitchener averages about 147 frost-free days a year,<ref name=climate /> a much lower number than cities on the Great Lakes due its inland location and higher elevation. Snowfall averages {{convert|160|cm|in|0}} per year.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Kitchener was {{convert|38.3|C|0}} on August 6 and 7, 1918, and again on July 27, 1941.<ref name="August 1918"/><ref name="July 1941"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-34.1|C|1}} on February 16, 2015.<ref name="climate"/>

==Education==
Kitchener has several public high schools, with [[Kitchener–Waterloo Collegiate and Vocational School]], founded in 1855, being the oldest. It is located on King Street in the northern area of the city, not far from the boundary of Waterloo. In the 1950s and 1960s several new high schools were constructed, including [[Eastwood Collegiate Institute]] in 1956 in what was then southeastern Kitchener, [[Forest Heights Collegiate Institute|Forest Heights C.I.]] in 1964 in the western Forest Heights neighbourhood, [[Grand River Collegiate Institute|Grand River C.I.]] in 1967 in the northeastern Heritage Park/Grand River Village area, and [[Cameron Heights Collegiate Institute|Cameron Heights C.I.]] in 1967 in the southern Downtown core. In 2006, [[Huron Heights Secondary School (Kitchener)|Huron Heights Secondary School]] opened in southwestern Kitchener.  It opened with a limited enrollment of only 9th and 10th grade students, and has since expanded to full capacity in the 2008–2009 school year.

The oldest Catholic high school in the city is [[St. Mary's High School (Kitchener)|St. Mary's High School]], which opened in 1907 as a girls-only Catholic school. It was transformed into a [[co-ed]] institution in 1990 after the closure of the neighbouring St. Jerome's High School, which had been a boys-only Catholic school. The same year, a second Catholic high school, [[Resurrection Catholic Secondary School]], opened in the west of the city, replacing St. Jerome's, which had operated from 1864 to 1990. In 2002, St. Mary's moved from its downtown location to a new one in the city's southwest. The former St. Jerome's building now houses the Lyle S. Hallman Faculty of Social Work at [[Wilfrid Laurier University]]. It opened at this location in 2006, bringing 300 faculty, staff, and students to downtown Kitchener.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.downtownkitchener.ca/news/wilfrid_laurier_faculty_social/ |title=Downtown Kitchener, Ontario, Canada – WLU Faculty of Social Work |publisher=Downtownkitchener.ca |access-date=3 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304113400/http://www.downtownkitchener.ca/news/wilfrid_laurier_faculty_social/ |archive-date=4 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The former St. Mary's High School building, meanwhile, has been transformed into both the head office of the [[Waterloo Catholic District School Board]] and the Kitchener Downtown Community Centre.

[[File:Conestoga College (Doon Campus) - Kitchener, ON.jpg|thumb|right|[[Conestoga College]]]]

The [[Doon, Ontario|Doon]] neighbourhood, once a separate village, is now part of Kitchener. It is home to the primary campus of [[Conestoga College]], one of the foremost non-university educational institutions in the province. For nine consecutive years, Conestoga has earned top overall ranking among Ontario colleges on the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) surveys, which measure graduate employment rates and satisfaction levels, and employer and student satisfaction. It is one of only seven [[institute of technology|polytechnical institutes]] in Canada.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.conestogac.on.ca/about/profilestats.jsp |title=College Profile / Stats &#124; Among Canada & Ontario's Leading Colleges & Polytechnic Institutes &#124; Conestoga College |publisher=Conestogac.on.ca |access-date=3 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429214314/http://www.conestogac.on.ca/about/profilestats.jsp |archive-date=29 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The [[University of Waterloo]] opened a School of Pharmacy in the downtown area. The City of Kitchener has contributed $30&nbsp;million from its $110&nbsp;million Economic Development Investment Fund, established in 2004, to the establishment of the UW Downtown Kitchener School of Pharmacy. Construction began in 2006, and the pharmacy program was launched in January 2008 with 92 students.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsrelease.uwaterloo.ca/news.php?id=4935 |title=UW launches pharmacy program with 92 students &#124; News, Media, and Events &#124; University of Waterloo |publisher=Newsrelease.uwaterloo.ca |date=16 January 2008 |access-date=3 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323203049/http://newsrelease.uwaterloo.ca/news.php?id=4935 |archive-date=23 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The school is expected to graduate about 120 pharmacists annually and will become the home of the Centre for Family Medicine, where new family physicians will be trained, as well as an optometry clinic and the International Pharmacy Graduate Program. Construction on the $147&nbsp;million facility was largely finished in spring 2009.

The University of Waterloo's (UW) Downtown Kitchener Health Sciences Campus is also the site of a satellite campus for [[McMaster University]]'s School of Medicine. The [[Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine]] admits 28 students per year to the MD program at the Waterloo Regional Campus. Students complete their clinical placements at hospitals and medical centres in the [[Waterloo Region|Waterloo-Wellington Region]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fhs.mcmaster.ca/mdprog/waterloo_regional_campus.html |title=Waterloo Regional Campus |publisher=McMaster University |access-date=7 September 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829102329/http://fhs.mcmaster.ca/mdprog/waterloo_regional_campus.html |archive-date=29 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> McMaster's satellite campus also features the Centre for Family Medicine, a family health team, and the [[University of Waterloo School of Optometry|University of Waterloo's School of Optometry]] clinic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kitchener.ca/en/businessinkitchener/UwHealthSciencesCampus.asp |title=City of Kitchener – UW Health Sciences Campus |publisher=City of Kitchener |access-date=7 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108215557/http://www.kitchener.ca/en/businessinkitchener/UwHealthSciencesCampus.asp |archive-date=8 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

{{Main|Kitchener–Waterloo Oktoberfest}}
Kitchener–Waterloo's [[Oktoberfest]] celebration is an annual nine-day event that started in 1969.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oktoberfest.ca/Welcome/History |title=The Legacy |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=Kitchener-Waterloo Oktoberfest |access-date=10 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215195249/http://www.oktoberfest.ca/Welcome/History |archive-date=15 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Based on the original German Oktoberfest, it is billed as ''Canada's Greatest [[Bavaria]]n Festival''. It is held every October, starting on the Friday before Canadian [[Thanksgiving (Canada)|Thanksgiving]] and running until the Saturday after. It is the largest Bavarian festival outside of Germany.

While its best-known draws are the [[beer]]-based celebrations, other family and cultural events also fill the week. The best-known is the Oktoberfest Thanksgiving Day Parade held on Thanksgiving Day; as it is the only major parade on Canadian Thanksgiving, it is televised nationally. Another icon of the festival is Miss Oktoberfest. This festival ambassador position is selected by a closed committee of judges from a panel of local applicants; community involvement and personal character are the main selection criteria.

The festival attracts an average of 700,000 people. During the 2016 Oktoberfest parade, an estimated 150,000 lined the streets along the route.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/oktoberfest-2016-comes-to-a-close-1.3117493 |title=Oktoberfest 2016 comes to a close |date=16 October 2016 |access-date=2017-03-29 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019151446/http://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/oktoberfest-2016-comes-to-a-close-1.3117493 |archive-date=19 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Kitchener's oldest outdoor park is [[Victoria Park, Kitchener|Victoria Park]], in the heart of downtown Kitchener. Numerous events and festivities are held in this park.

A cast-bronze statue of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] is in Victoria Park, along with a cannon.

Rockway Gardens are adjacent to the Rockway golf course and occupy a long narrow strip of land alongside King Street as it rushes down to meet the Conestoga Parkway and become Highway 8. It is a popular site for wedding photos in the summer.

Kitchener has an extensive community trail system. The trails, which are controlled and run by the city, are hundreds of kilometres in length. Due to Kitchener's close proximity to the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]], several community trails and paths border the river's shores. This convenient access to the Grand River has drawn tourists to the city. However, Kitchener's trails and especially natural areas remain underfunded by city council and as a result, many are not adequately maintained.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kitchener.ca/Files/Item/item9645_csd-06-105_-_park___trails.pdf |title=Staff report regarding state of Kitchener's park system |publisher=Kitchener.ca |access-date=10 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316205637/http://www.kitchener.ca/Files/Item/item9645_csd-06-105_-_park___trails.pdf |archive-date=16 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Highways and expressways===
[[File:Highway 401 Grand River.jpg|thumb|left|[[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]] in Kitchener looking east towards the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]]]]
[[File:Conestoga.jpg|thumb|right|[[Highway 8 (Ontario)|Highway 8]] as seen from Franklin Street bridge]]
Kitchener was very proactive and visionary about its transportation network in the 1960s, with the province undertaking at that time construction of the [[Conestoga Parkway]] from the western boundary (just past Homer Watson Boulevard) across the south side of the city and looping north along the Grand River to Northfield Drive in Waterloo.
Subsequent upgrades took the Conestoga west beyond Trussler Road and north towards [[St. Jacobs, Ontario|St Jacobs]], with eight lanes through its middle stretch.

The Conestoga Parkway bears the provincial highway designations of Highways [[Highway 7 (Ontario)|7]], [[Highway 8 (Ontario)|8]] and [[Highway 85 (Ontario)|85]]. King Street becomes Hwy 8 where it meets the Parkway in the south and leads down to the 401, but Old King Street survives as the street-route through Freeport to the Preston area of [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]]. Up until construction of the Conestoga, Highland Road through [[Baden, Ontario|Baden]] had been the primary highway to [[Stratford, Ontario|Stratford]]. Victoria Street was then and remains the primary highway to [[Guelph]] but this is slated to be bypassed with an entirely new highway beginning at the Wellington Street exit and running roughly north of and parallel to the old route.

There are two interchanges with [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]] on Kitchener's southern border. In addition to the primary link where Hwy 8 merges into the Hwy 401, there is another interchange on the west side with Homer Watson Boulevard.

In order to reduce the congestion on Highway 8, a new interchange has been proposed on Highway 401 at Trussler Road, which would serve the rapidly growing west side of Kitchener. Although this proposal is supported by the Region of Waterloo, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation has no plans to proceed with an interchange at Trussler Road.

===City streets===
Unlike most southern Ontario cities whose streets follow a strict British grid survey pattern, Kitchener's streets are laid out in a complex radial pattern on the Continental models most familiar to the German settlers.

There is good historical reason for this. Kitchener was one of the few places in Ontario where the settlers arrived in advance of government surveyors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} The Mennonites who had banded together as the German Company to purchase the township from Richard Beasley simply divided their vast parcel of land by the number of shareholder households and then drew random lots to confer title on individual farms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} There was no grid survey done—no lines, no concessions, no right-of-way corridors for roads. When it came time to punch roads through the wilderness, the farmers modelled the road network on what was familiar to them, which was the pattern of villages in Switzerland and southern Germany.

This is a Continental Radial pattern and the result was major streets extended through diagonals cutting across the grid of smaller streets and converging at multiple-point intersections which, as the communities became more prosperous and if the automobile had not displaced the horse, might someday have become [[roundabouts]] decorated with circular gardens, fountains or statuary in the style of European cities. Five-point intersections created by converging diagonals are legion in the older areas.

In 2004, [[roundabouts]] were introduced to the Region of Waterloo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/gettingaround/roundabouts.asp |title=Roundabouts – Region of Waterloo |publisher=Regionofwaterloo.ca |access-date=10 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619124821/http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/gettingAround/roundabouts.asp |archive-date=19 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Besides improving traffic flow, they will help the region lower pollution from emissions created by idling vehicles. In 2006, the first two were installed along Ira Needles Boulevard in Kitchener. Some people{{Who|date=February 2017}} argue roundabouts are ideal for intersections in this region because of the aforementioned historical growth along Continental radial patterns versus the British grid systems, but all installs have been at T and cross intersections making the point irrelevant.

A controversial plan would extend River Road through an area known as Hidden Valley,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waterlooians.ca/index.php?view=41 |title=Strengthening Community |publisher=Waterlooians.ca |access-date=3 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706212813/http://www.waterlooians.ca/index.php?view=41 |archive-date=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> but the pressure of traffic and the absence of any other full east–west arterials between Fairway Road and the Highway 401 is forcing this development ahead.

===Public transport===

====Early history====
{{See also|Kitchener and Waterloo Street Railway|Kitchener Public Utilities Commission}}

[[File:Berlin & Waterloo Street Railway Canadian Block photo.jpg|thumb|The [[Berlin and Waterloo Street Railway]], seen here on King Street in downtown Kitchener, was the earliest documented public transport in the city.<ref name=kitchener-transit-history />]]

The earliest recorded urban public transport in Kitchener was a [[horsecar|horse-drawn streetcar]] service along King Street, the [[Berlin and Waterloo Street Railway]], which began operating in 1888.<ref name=elso-kwsr /><ref name=kitchener-transit-history /> The system was [[electrification|electrified]] in 1895. The [[Preston and Berlin Street Railway]], an [[interurban]] service connecting Kitchener to [[Preston, Ontario|Preston]] (now a part of Cambridge), began operation in 1904. It used a stretch of Berlin and Waterloo Street Railway tracks to access downtown Kitchener.<ref name=pb-trainweb>{{cite web |url=http://www.trainweb.org/elso/pb.htm |title=Preston & Berlin Street Railway |first=William E. |last=Miller |date=19 July 2004 |website=Electric Lines in Southern Ontario |access-date=15 March 2021}}</ref> In 1906, the Berlin and Waterloo Street Railway was [[municipalization|municipalized]] and came under the management of the Berlin Light and Power Commission, which was renamed the Berlin Public Utilities Commission. It was later renamed the Kitchener and Waterloo Street Railway following the city's official name change, with the commission also being renamed to the [[Kitchener Public Utilities Commission]] (PUC).<ref name=kitchener-transit-history />

In 1923, the successor of the Preston and Berlin Street Railway, the [[Grand River Railway]], built a new [[main line (railway)|mainline]] which bypassed downtown Kitchener. Its new transfer point to the municipal streetcar system was [[Kitchener Junction station]] at what was then the south end of the city, which was also the site of the PUC's [[car barn|streetcar depot]]. Starting in 1939, buses began being used for crosstown bus services which intersected with the streetcar line.<ref name=kitchener-transit-history /> In 1947, the PUC replaced the street railway system with a [[trolleybus]] system.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.therecord.com/life/local-history/2021/01/22/flash-from-the-past-faster-smoother-quieter-trolleys-take-over-king-street.html |title=Flash From the Past: Faster, smoother, quieter trolleys take over King Street |first=rych |last=mills<!-- lowercase is from original --> |date=22 January 2021 |work=Waterloo Region Record |access-date=24 January 2021 |quote=From 1888 to 1947, Berlin/Kitchener and Waterloo had been connected by streetcars plying King Street.

====Grand River Transit====
{{Main|Grand River Transit}}

[[File:GrandRiverTransit3.jpg|thumb|The iXpress system provides [[express bus]] service connecting downtown Kitchener to its suburbs, as well as to the neighbouring cities of Waterloo and Cambridge.]]

In 2000, Kitchener Transit was merged with [[Cambridge Transit]] and put under the management of the Region of Waterloo, becoming known as [[Grand River Transit]] (GRT). GRT began reorganizing its expanded network, which now serves the three cities of Kitchener, Waterloo, and Cambridge as a unified regional transit system. In 2003, the Region of Waterloo received a federal grant to fund its Central Transit Corridor Express plan, which built on earlier proposals dating as far back as the 1970s for a regional express transit corridor connecting Kitchener, Waterloo, and Cambridge. Its initial implementation, in 2005, was a single-route, limited-stop [[express bus]] service branded as ''iXpress'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grt.ca/web/transit.nsf/5f22897663adffc585256e5a005c53df/b719b358a4be8bbb85256f4e005b07c6!OpenDocument |title=Transit Programs in GRT |publisher=Grt.ca |access-date=3 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125144410/http://www.grt.ca/web/transit.nsf/5f22897663adffc585256e5a005c53df/b719b358a4be8bbb85256f4e005b07c6%21OpenDocument |archive-date=25 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> along with the implementation of technologies like [[Bus priority signal|transit signal priority]] (TSP) which were new to the region at the time.<ref name=2009-ixpress-report />{{rp|26}} Major iXpress stations in Kitchener were {{stn|Grand River Hospital}}, Fairview (now [[Fairway station]]), and the Charles Street Terminal.<ref name=2009-ixpress-report>{{cite report |url=http://www.civil.uwaterloo.ca/bhellinga/publications/Publications/Region%20of%20Waterloo%20UTSP%20Final%20Report%20Dec_09.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.civil.uwaterloo.ca/bhellinga/publications/Publications/Region%20of%20Waterloo%20UTSP%20Final%20Report%20Dec_09.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |title=iXpress: Central Transit Corridor Express Project, Urban Transportation Showcase Program Final Report |author=Regional Municipality of Waterloo |date=December 2009 |website=uwaterloo.ca}}</ref>{{rp|21–22}} New iXpress routes were added in the years that followed, with the original route being rebranded as the 200 iXpress.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/grand-river-transit-new-schedule-adds-ixpress-alters-many-routes-1.3218082 |title=Where's my bus?

Long-term planning around the Central Transit Corridor led to many interconnected initiatives being bundled into a staged [[rapid transit]] plan. In June 2011, the Waterloo Region council approved the Stage 1 plan for a single-line [[light rail transit]] (LRT) system between the existing bus terminals at [[Conestoga Mall (Waterloo, Ontario)|Conestoga Mall]] in north Waterloo and [[Fairview Park Mall]] in south Kitchener, with adapted [[bus rapid transit]] (aBRT) connecting through to downtown Galt in Cambridge.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.therecord.com/news/local/article/548497--rail-plan-passes |title=Rail plan passes |first=Jeff |last=Outhit |newspaper=Waterloo Region Record |date=15 June 2011 |access-date=17 March 2021 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312025134/http://www.therecord.com/news/local/article/548497--rail-plan-passes |archive-date=12 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Stage 2, which {{as of|2021|lc=y}} is still in planning, would replace the aBRT route with an extension of the light rail line.<ref>{{cite web|title=RAPID TRANSIT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT PHASE 2, STEP 3b – PREFERRED RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM OPTION AND STAGING PLAN|url=http://rapidtransit.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/projectinformation/resources/e-09-073_-_recommended_system_report.pdf|access-date=9 April 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113162926/http://rapidtransit.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/projectinformation/resources/e-09-073_-_recommended_system_report.pdf|archive-date=13 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=ION Bus Rapid Transit – Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://www.grt.ca/en/travelwithus/FAQ-ION-Bus-Rapid-Transit.asp |access-date=24 March 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325024953/http://www.grt.ca/en/travelwithus/FAQ-ION-Bus-Rapid-Transit.asp |archive-date=25 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/lrt-ion-cambridge-region-waterloo-1.3970421 |title=There's still wiggle room in the Region of Waterloo's LRT plans for Cambridge |last=Sharkey |first=Jackie |date=8 February 2017 |website=CBC |access-date=10 March 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312061634/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/lrt-ion-cambridge-region-waterloo-1.3970421 |archive-date=12 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://rapidtransit.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/resourcesGeneral/FINAL_Stage-2-ION-PCC-No.-2-Display-Boards_reduced2.pdf |title=Stage 2 ION: Light Rail Transit (LRT) |last=Sharkey |first=Jackie |date=February 2017 |website=Region of Waterloo |access-date=24 March 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325030210/https://rapidtransit.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/resourcesGeneral/FINAL_Stage-2-ION-PCC-No.-2-Display-Boards_reduced2.pdf |archive-date=25 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

GO Transit bus service to Kitchener began on 31 October 2009, with a route stopping at Kitchener's Charles Street Terminal on the way from Waterloo to [[Mississauga]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/go-transit-expands-buses-to-kitchener-mississauga-1.449035 |publisher=[[CTV News]] |title=Go Transit expands buses to Kitchener, Mississauga |date=30 October 2009 |access-date=17 March 2021}}</ref> This was followed on 19 December 2011 by the extension of GO train service to Kitchener from its previous terminus at {{stl|GO Transit|Georgetown}}.<ref name=transittoronto>{{cite web |url=http://transit.toronto.on.ca/regional/2102.shtml |title=GO Transit's Kitchener Line |last=Garcia |first=Daniel |publisher=Transit Toronto |date=25 June 2015 |access-date=17 March 2021}}</ref> GO bus service consists of the 25 Waterloo–Mississauga and 30 Kitchener routes. Both routes connect Kitchener with points east; the former to Mississauga's [[Square One Bus Terminal]] via Sportsworld (in southeast Kitchener), Cambridge, [[Aberfoyle, Ontario|Aberfoyle]], and [[Milton, Ontario|Milton]], and the latter as a [[limited-stop]] express to {{stl|GO Transit|Bramalea}} with some stops in northern Mississauga. GO train service also travels east, terminating at Toronto's [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]].
A new bus service was launched on April 9, 2022, by [[FlixBus]] to link Kitchener and Toronto via a more direct route.

{{Further|Kitchener station|Kitchener line}}

Kitchener's primary railway corridor is the [[CN Rail|CN]]/[[GO Transit|GO]] [[Guelph Subdivision]]. It runs approximately east–west through the northern section of downtown Kitchener. It was originally laid out and constructed in 1856 by the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] (GTR), and after the GTR's acquisition of the [[Great Western Railway (Ontario)|Great Western Railway]], the mainline through Kitchener became known informally as the "North Main Line" in contrast with the "South Main Line" through [[Brantford, Ontario|Brantford]], both connecting [[London, Ontario|London]] and [[Toronto]]. Coming from the east, the [[Waterloo Spur]] diverges from the mainline and heads north through [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] and ultimately to [[Elmira, Ontario|Elmira]]. The spur was formerly owned by CN, but is now owned by the [[Region of Waterloo]].

[[File:Kitchener train station 4.jpg|thumb|[[Kitchener station]] is the city's [[intercity rail|intercity]] passenger railway station.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/exploring-the-region/intercity-transit.aspx |title=Intercity Transit |publisher=Region of Waterloo |access-date=15 March 2021}}</ref>]]

[[Kitchener station]] lies a short distance west along the track from the junction with the Waterloo Spur. The current station building dates from 1897 and is a heritage structure which is owned by [[Via Rail]], Canada's national passenger railway. Both Via Rail [[Québec City–Windsor Corridor (Via Rail)|''Corridor'']] service and [[GO Transit]] [[Kitchener line]] service are available at the station, the latter of which has its western terminus at the station. Via Rail service consists of two trains per day in each direction along the Toronto–London–Sarnia route; one westbound train terminates at [[Sarnia station|Sarnia]] while another terminates at [[London station (Ontario)|London]], while both eastbound trains terminate at [[Toronto Union Station]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.viarail.ca/sites/all/files/media/pdfs/schedules/summer2020/24-25_Toronto-London-Sarnia.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://www.viarail.ca/sites/all/files/media/pdfs/schedules/summer2020/24-25_Toronto-London-Sarnia.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |title=Toronto-London-Sarnia |access-date=8 March 2020 |publisher=[[Via Rail]]}}</ref> GO train service was originally extended to Kitchener in 2011 from its previous western terminus at [[Georgetown, Ontario|Georgetown]].<ref name=2011kitchenerline>{{cite news |url=https://www.therecord.com/sports-story/2567786-go-trains-to-run-from-kitchener-to-toronto-in-2011/ |title=GO trains to run from Kitchener to Toronto in 2011 |date=13 November 2010 |newspaper=[[Waterloo Region Record]] |access-date=8 March 2020}}</ref> GO service began with two trains per direction per weekday,<ref name=2011kitchenerline /> but since its inception train frequency has gradually increased and as of early 2020 it stands at 8 eastbound and 7 westbound trains per weekday, with no weekend service.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gotransit.com/static_files/gotransit/assets/pdf/TripPlanning/FullSchedules/FS11012020/Table31.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://www.gotransit.com/static_files/gotransit/assets/pdf/TripPlanning/FullSchedules/FS11012020/Table31.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |publisher=[[GO Transit]] |access-date=8 March 2020 |title=Kitchener GO Train and Bus Schedule}}</ref> In 2017, [[Metrolinx]] (the parent agency of GO Transit) constructed a purpose-built train layover facility on Shirley Avenue to supplement its existing adapted layover facility, which was at capacity.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metrolinxengage.com/sites/default/files/waterloo_region_council_august_30_final.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://www.metrolinxengage.com/sites/default/files/waterloo_region_council_august_30_final.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |publisher=[[Metrolinx]] |website=Metrolinx Engage |title=Creating Connections in Waterloo Region |date=30 August 2017 |access-date=8 March 2020}}</ref>

While Kitchener benefits from increasingly frequent commuter-oriented GO service east to Toronto, intercity Via Rail service to the city has been largely unchanged for years, limiting its connectivity to [[Southwestern Ontario]] to the west. In contrast, the South Main Line through Brantford (which is still owned by CN) has faster and more frequent service between Toronto and London than the North Main Line does, along with larger double-tracked sections. In 2017, the Ontario Liberal government proposed a Windsor–Toronto [[high-speed rail]] line through Kitchener, which would improve travel times to nearby major cities as well as to the [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Bill|title=Province initiates EA for high-speed rail|url=https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7325518-province-initiates-ea-for-high-speed-rail/|publisher=Kitchener Post|access-date=25 June 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328004435/https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7325518-province-initiates-ea-for-high-speed-rail/|archive-date=28 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The proposal, if approved, would provide a 48-minute trip from Kitchener to downtown Toronto.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toronto – Kitchener – London Ontario High Speed Rail Pre-Feasibility Study prepared for Ontario Ministry of Transport Commercial in Confidence|url=http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/publications/pdfs/toronto-kitchener-london-ontario-high-speed-rail-feasibility-study.pdf|website=mto.gov.on.ca|access-date=25 June 2017|page=8|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704192850/http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/publications/pdfs/toronto-kitchener-london-ontario-high-speed-rail-feasibility-study.pdf|archive-date=4 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> With the election of a new [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Conservative]] government, funding for the project was indefinitely paused.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/ontario-pauses-high-speed-rail-funding-will-look-at-enhancing-current-services |title=Ontario pauses high-speed rail funding, will look at enhancing current services |date=15 April 2019 |access-date=8 March 2020 |first=Shawn |last=Jeffords |newspaper=The [[National Post]]}}</ref>

Freight trains in Kitchener are operated by the [[Canadian National Railway]] and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. These railways serve several customers, many of which are in industrial parks in southern Kitchener.

===Air===

The closest airport to Kitchener is the [[Region of Waterloo International Airport]] in nearby Breslau, about 12&nbsp;km by road from downtown Kitchener. While it is a thriving [[general aviation|general-aviation]] field, it is not heavily served by scheduled airlines. [[WestJet]] offers year-round service to [[Calgary]] and weekly service to [[Orlando International Airport|Orlando]] in the winter.<ref>{{cite web|title=WestJet Airlines|url=http://www.waterlooairport.ca/en/flightinformation/westjetairlines.asp?_mid_=17661|publisher=Region of Waterloo International Airport|access-date=25 June 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705053025/http://www.waterlooairport.ca/en/flightinformation/westjetairlines.asp?_mid_=17661|archive-date=5 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Sunwing Airlines]] offers seasonal service to [[Cayo Santa Maria]]. Most air travellers use Toronto's [[Pearson International Airport|Lester B. Pearson International Airport]] or [[John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport]]. There is a [[helipad]] in Kitchener near Google's Kitchener offices. In June, 2017 the helipad was temporarily closed due to possible interference from a construction crane on the flight path.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Weidner|first1=Johanna|title=Crane on skyline so Kitchener helipad closes|url=https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7389678-crane-on-skyline-so-kitchener-helipad-closes/|newspaper=Waterloo Region Record|access-date=25 June 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328004435/https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7389678-crane-on-skyline-so-kitchener-helipad-closes/|archive-date=28 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

There are 10 wards, and 53 planning communities or neighbourhoods.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kitchener.ca/maps/maps.html |title=City of Kitchener |publisher=Kitchener.ca |access-date=3 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706184428/http://www.kitchener.ca/maps/maps.html |archive-date=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> There are also 29 neighbourhood associations recognized by the city, which in some cases do not correspond to the names and boundaries of planning communities designated by the city.  In some cases the neighbourhood associations cover several neighbourhoods and/or planning communities and the name of one neighbourhood is sometimes used to refer to the entire area.

The Stanley Park Neighbourhood Association, for example, covers much of the eastern and southeastern area of the city including the planning communities of Stanley Park, Heritage Park, Idlewood, and Grand River North and South. Further complicating things is that the first area of development named Stanley Park, which is where Stanley Park school is located and where Stanley Park Conservation Area is located, has been included within the city's planning district of Heritage Park, leaving only later-developed areas of Stanley Park plus an adjacent residential neighbourhood to the south, originally referred to as Sunnyside, in the Stanley Park planning neighbourhood.  The Forest Heights Neighbourhood Association includes the Forest Hills neighbourhood/planning district to the east of Forest Heights proper.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/NeighbourhoodAssociations.asp |title=City of Kitchener |publisher=Kitchener.ca |access-date=5 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908075809/http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/NeighbourhoodAssociations.asp |archive-date=8 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
