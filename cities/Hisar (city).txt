'''Hisar''' {{audio|Hisar.ogg|pronunciation}} also known as '''Hissar''' is the administrative headquarters of [[Hisar district]] in the state of [[Haryana]] in northwestern [[India]]. It is located {{convert|164|km|abbr=on}} to the west of [[New Delhi]], [[India]]'s capital, and has been identified as a [[National Capital Region (India)#Counter magnets|counter-magnet]] city for the [[National Capital Region (India)|National Capital Region]] to develop as an alternative center of growth to Delhi. 

The city was ruled by several major powers, including the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryans]] in the third century BC, the [[Tughlaq dynasty|Tughlaqs]] in the 14th century, the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in the 16th century, and the [[British Empire|British]] in the 19th century. After India achieved independence, it was unified with the state of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]. When the Punjab was divided in 1966, Hisar became part of Haryana.

The current name was given in 1354 AD, as ''Hisar-e-Firoza'' by [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq]], the [[Sultanate of Delhi|Sultan of Delhi]] from 1351 to 1388. The [[Ghaggar-Hakra River|Ghaggar]] and [[Drishadvati]] Rivers once flowed through the city, but they have now changed their course. Hisar has a [[continental climate]], with very hot summers and relatively cool winters. The most commonly spoken languages are [[Hindi]], [[Haryanvi]], and [[Bagri language|Bagri]].

==History==
===Early history===
Archeological excavations at nearby locations of [[Rakhigarhi]] (7000 BCE), [[Siswal]] (4000 BCE), and [[Lohari Ragho]] suggest the presence of human habitation from [[pre-Harappan]] period. Later, [[Aryan]] people settled around [[Drsadvati River]]. The [[Jain Agamas (Śvētāmbara)|Jain]] literature [[Uttaradhyayana|Uttaradhayana Sutra]] ((599/540 - 527/468 BCE) mentions a town Isukara in the [[Kuru Kingdom|Kuru]] (c. 1200 – c. 900 BCE) country which is believed to be the earlier name of Hisar.<ref name="imperial gazetteer">{{cite web|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V13_151.gif|title=Imperial gazetteer of India|publisher=University of Chicago|access-date=27 May 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010033922/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V13_151.gif|archive-date=10 October 2012}}</ref> The [[Agrasen|kingdom of Hisar]], with its capital at [[Agroha (town)|Agroha]], possibly assisted [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (reign: 321–297 BCE) in [[Seleucid–Mauryan war|his war]] against the [[Seleucid dynasty|Greeks]].<ref name="hisar gazetteer">{{cite web|url=http://revenueharyana.gov.in/html/gazeteers/gazetteer_india_hisar.pdf|title=Hisar gazetteer|publisher=Haryana Gazetteers Organisation|access-date=23 May 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501213030/http://revenueharyana.gov.in/html/gazeteers/gazetteer_india_hisar.pdf|archive-date=1 May 2014}}</ref> The kingdom was then included in the [[Mauryan Empire]], as evidenced by the discovery of [[Ashokan pillar]]s in the [[Firoz_Shah_Palace_Complex#Ashoka|vicinity of the city]].
