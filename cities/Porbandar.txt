'''Porbandar''' is a city and the headquarters of [[Porbandar district]] in the [[Indian state]] of [[Gujarat]]. It is the birthplace of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Sudama]]. It was the former capital of the [[Porbandar State|Porbandar princely state]]. Porbandar and [[Chhaya, India|Chhaya]] are the twin cities of each other and both cities are jointly governed by Porbandar–Chhaya Municipal Corporation. 

== History ==
===Late  Harappan settlement (1600-1400 BCE)===
Onshore explorations in and around Porbandar brought to light the remains of a [[Periodisation of the Indus Valley Civilisation|Late Harappan]] settlement dating back to the 16th-14th centuries BCE. There is evidence to suggest that the Harappan legacy of [[Sea|maritime]] activity continued till the late Harappan period on the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] coast. The discovery of ancient jetties along the Porbandar creek signifies the importance of Porbandar as an active center of maritime activities in the past.<ref name="Gaur">{{cite journal|author=A.S Gaur, Sundaresh, A.D. Odedra|title=New light on the maritime archaeology of Porbandar, Saurashtra Coast, Gujarat|journal=Man and Environment |volume=29|issue=1|pages=103–107|year=2004}}</ref>

Indian theology views Porbandar as the birthplace of Sudama, a friend of [[Krishna]]. For this reason, it is also referred to as Sudaamapuri or Sudamapuri.<ref name="Gaur" />

=== Princely Porbandar (1600 CE onwards) ===
{{Main|Porbandar State}}
Porbandar was the seat of the eponymous [[princely state]] in [[British India]]. Later the state belonged to the [[Jethwa]] clan of [[Rajput]]s and had been established in the area since at least the mid-16th century. The state was subordinate to the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] governor of [[Gujarat Subah]] until being overrun by the [[Maratha]]s in the latter half of the 18th century. After, they came under the authority of the [[Gaekwad]] court at [[Vadodara|Baroda]] and eventually of the [[Peshwa]].

===After Independence===
Upon the [[Independence of India]] in 1947, the state was annexed into the [[dominion of India]]. It was merged with the '[[United State of Kathiawar]]', effective 15 February 1948 and eventually came to form part of the present-day state of Gujarat. The last King of Porbandar was [[Natwarsinhji Bhavsinhji]] Maharaj.

== Geography ==
Porbandar is located at {{Coord|21|37|48|N|69|36|0|E|}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/09/Porbandar.html|title=Maps, Weather, and Airports for Porbandar, India|website=www.fallingrain.com}}</ref> It has an average elevation of 1&nbsp;metre (3&nbsp;ft).

=== Climate ===
Like most of Gujarat, Porbandar has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSh'') with three distinct seasons: the “cool” from October to March, the “hot” in April, May and early June, and the [[Monsoon of South Asia|monsoonal]] “wet” from mid-June to September.<ref name="Climate-Data.org">{{cite web|title=Porbandar - Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table|url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/2820/|access-date=2015-10-29|publisher=Climate-Data.org}}</ref>

Almost no rain falls outside the monsoon season, except for a very few late-season [[tropical cyclones]].  The most powerful one occurred on 22 October 1975 and produced a storm surge of {{convert|4|m|ft|0|disp=or}}. During the monsoon season, rainfall is exceedingly erratic: Annual rainfall has been as low as {{convert|32.2|mm|in|2|disp=or}} in 1918 and {{convert|34.3|mm|in|2|disp=or}} in 1939, but as high as {{convert|1850.6|mm|in|2|disp=or}} in 1983—when a cyclone caused over {{convert|1100|mm|in|1}} to fall over four days<ref>Francis P. A. and Sulochana Gadgil; [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=55D971E5C651CB56E6DBA7D4FA33EDC7?doi=10.1.1.389.5007&rep=rep1&type=pdf ‘Intense Rainfall Events over the West Coast during the Summer Monsoon Season’] (CAOS REPORT 2002 AS 1); published by Centre for Atmospheric and Oceanic Studies; [[Indian Institute of Science]], Bangalore</ref>—and {{convert|1251.7|mm|in|2|disp=or}} in 1878.

With a [[coefficient of variation]] exceeding fifty percent and an expectation of only 41 percent of mean annual rainfall in the driest year in ten, the Porbandar region is among the most variable in the world<ref>Dewar, Robert E. and Wallis, James R; ‘Geographical patterning of interannual rainfall variability in the tropics and near tropics: An L-moments approach’; in ''[[Journal of Climate]]'', 12; pp. 3457-3466</ref>—comparable to northern Australia, the Brazilian [[sertão]] and the Kiribatese [[Line Islands]].<ref>Van Etten, Eddie J.B.; ‘Inter-annual Rainfall Variability of Arid Australia: greater than elsewhere?’ ''[[Australian Geographer]]''; 40 (2009), pp. 109-120</ref>

An illustration of Porbandar's extremely variable rainfall can be seen from 1899 to 1905 when seven successive years produced annual falls of:
* {{convert|83.4|mm|in|2}} in 1899
* {{convert|1185.1|mm|in|2}} in 1900
* {{convert|99.8|mm|in|2}} in 1901
* {{convert|756.9|mm|in|2}} in 1902
* {{convert|575.2|mm|in|2}} in 1903
* {{convert|124.5|mm|in|2}} in 1904 and
* {{convert|134.4|mm|in|2}} in 1905

Porbandar, owing to its coastal location, is the least hot of all major [[list of cities in Gujarat by population|cities in Gujarat]]: Average high temperatures do not reach {{convert|35|C|F|0|disp=or}} in any month.
