== Pre-foundation ==
[[File:Map of the Viceroyalty of New Spain.svg|thumb|277x277px|[[Viceroyalty of New Spain]]]]
[[New Spain|The Viceroy of New Spain]], [[List of viceroys of New Spain|Juan Francisco Güémez and Horcasitas]] on Saturday, September 3, 1746, founded a [[colony]] in the ''Seno Mexicano'' (West coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]), dismembering the [[New Kingdom of León]]. Two years later, on Wednesday December 25, 1748, [[José de Escandón, 1st Count of Sierra Gorda|José de Escandon and Helguera]] founded [[Llera, Tamaulipas|Villa de Llera]], part of the Late Colonization of [[Nuevo Santander|New Santander]], named after [[Santander, Spain|Santander]], the capital of [[Cantabria]], Spain.<ref name=":0" /> Villa de Santa María del Agua de Agüayo was founded on October 6, 1750.<ref name=":0" />

==History==
[[File:Montaje de Victoria.jpg|left|thumb|267x267px|Montage of places in Ciudad Victoria]]
Villa de Santa María de Aguayo was named after the wife of the first Count of [[Count of Revilla Gigedo|Revillagigedo]] Don [[Juan Francisco de Güemes, 1st Count of Revillagigedo|Juan Francisco de Güémez y Horcasitas]], named Doña Antonia Cepherina Pacheco de Padilla, a native of [[San Miguel de Aguayo, Cantabria|Aguayo]], Province of [[Santander, Spain|Santander]], Spain.<ref name=":0" />{{Clarify|reason=Which one is the native of Aguayo, husband or wife?|date=March 2018}}

The settlement was founded by José de Escandon and Helguera, [[County of Sierra Gorda|Count of Sierra Gorda]], during his second campaign of the Pacification and Colonization Plan of the coast of the Mexican Seno, later called [[Nuevo Santander|New Santander]], today [[Tamaulipas]].<ref name=":0" /> The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish settlement]] open to the plain to the [[Northern Mexico|East]] and surrounded to the west by the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]], a strategic location that also received breezes from the north and east.<ref name=":0" /> The town was administered by Captain D. Juan de Astigárraga, who drew up and carried out the first irrigation works. His work led to an increase in agriculture and, subsequently, a rapid rise in population.<ref name=":0" />

In [[Religion|religious]] matters, the settlement was under the command of a [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] named Antonio Javier de Aréchaga, who was also in charge of the mission of [[Philip the Apostle|San Felipe]], which was founded with 150 [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous]] people. That [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Catholic missions|mission]] progressed more than those previously founded, because in the lands that were designated, they were opened by local [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]].<ref name=":0" />

Captain Astigárraga died three years after the Villa de Agüayo was founded, and Escandon then conferred the appointment of captain to replace him in the command, Don Miguel de Córdoba.<ref name=":0" />

Under the administration of the new captain, the Villa de Agüayo continued to progress, and when its statistics were formed in 1757, the settlement had in its farmhouse and estates located in its demarcation more than 1000 inhabitants who had 8600 heads of cattle and horses, and 4100 of smaller cattle.<ref name=":0" />

The [[Nobility|noble]] and [[Military rank|military]] of [[Belgium|Belgian]] descent, José de Craywinckel, when he visited the settlement, proposed to the Viceroy the reactivation of the Olazarán mine, which was abandoned in the Boca de Caballeros, since this measure would tend to give the settlement greater impetus in its prosperity, creating new interests and attracting new [[Monterrey|neighbours]] by this means, it being possible to expect that Villa de Aguayo would soon become one of the main populations of the new colony.<ref name=":0" />

The nobleman also proposed to the [[Viceroy]] at that time, to undertake a campaign against rebellious Native Americans of the Síghue, who had their [[ranchería]]s by the ravines and valleys of the [[Sierra Madre Oriental|Sierra Madre]] and in defines of their land harassed the shepherds and estates of the demarcation of Aguayo, arriving in his raids to join with the [[Janambre]] people in the attacks they undertook against the nearby Spanish settlements of [[Jaumave, Tamaulipas|Jaumave]] and [[Llera, Tamaulipas|Llera]].<ref name=":0" />

By this date some masonry houses were begun to be built in Aguayo, the materials for the construction of a Catholic church were gathered and large sugarcane [[plantation]]s were established in the surrounding lands. The neighbourhood of this town also carried out the salt trade that was going to be collected from the [[Saltern|saltworks]] of San Fernando and la Marina, with the villages of the interior of Charcas and the southern part of the [[New Kingdom of León]].<ref name=":0" />

The Spanish settlement of Villa de Aguayo was distributed in perfect [[Grid plan|grid]] form, and in its second settlement a few leagues east of its foundation, changing by the constant claim of the Native American tribes of Janambres and Pisones. The settlement was from the beginning the geographical central node communicating with all the settlements of New Santander.<ref name=":0" />

As was the Spanish provision, land was designated for the construction of the Catholic Church, the Public Square, the seat of the Captaincy of the Civil - Military and [[Trade]] Authority, spaces that over time are known as the Historical Centre, formerly known as Plaza "Hidalgo", "Plaza de Armas" or "Plaza de Catedral". The settlement was dispersed and composed of 58 families with 409 people.<ref name=":0" />

The river that crossed the settlement is the so-called San Marcos, which has an irrigation ditch, whose abundance of water gave the population all the irrigation it needs for the subsistence of its inhabitants, irrigation of plots and other sowing of [[Maize|corn]], fostering also the cultivation of the [[Sugarcane|cane]]. The quality of the land was adequate for all fruits typical of the [[Northern Mexico|region]] and facilitated the breeding and conservation of [[livestock]].<ref name=":0" />

Its location was one of the most advantageous in favour of the [[Treasury|Royal Treasury]], both for being the first transit of the colony, and because its [[crop]]s and livestock promise great movement, evidencing its growth at the beginning of its founding, which was 11 families.<ref name=":0" />

=== Colonial period ===
[[File:José de Escandón.jpg|thumb|[[José de Escandón]] y Helguera, 1st Count of Sierra Gorda]]
Unlike the modes of settlement that were commonly raised during the [[New Spain|vice-regal period in New Spain]], which followed a [[missionary]] and [[Présidial|presidial]] structure, the new populations designed by [[José de Escandón, 1st Count of Sierra Gorda|José de Escandon]] had marked differences in the [[Culture|cultural]], [[social]], [[Politics|political]] and [[Economy|economic spheres]].<ref name=":0" />

The new populations that Escandon developed in the territory that is now known as Tamaulipas, called in the eighteenth-century New Santander, are based on ideas that have as a reference a way of exercising control over the [[Land development|development]] of the city and the territory, through its [[Production (economics)|economic production]]. The direct consequences of this form of [[urban design]] marked in New Spain the opening to a new way of consolidating a border territory.<ref name=":0" />

[[José de Escandón, 1st Count of Sierra Gorda|José de Escandon y Helguera]], developed cattle [[ranching]] extensively and in a limited way [[agriculture]], since for the most part "temporary" was practiced, and [[commerce]] also developed. The colonized territory was integrated and populated up to the [[Rio Grande]], configuring the map of what is now Tamaulipas.<ref name=":0" />

In addition, Escandon proposed the strategic location arrangements between each new population, a day away, which would facilitate that in cases of reoccurrence of attacks by the natives, could support each other. These are the characteristics that made the colonization of the New Santander transcendent; Although the reality did not always reflect the initial spirit of colonization, the model developed by José de Escandon proposed a new form of territorial occupation that had not been seen until the 18th century in New Spain.<ref name=":0" />
[[File:Casa Filizola.jpg|left|thumb|Casa de los Hermanos Filizola, restored to inhabit the Pinacoteca Tamaulipas, Ciudad Victoria, Mexico]]

=== Post-colonial period ===
After the [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexican Independence]]  New Santander was renamed "Tamaulipas<ref name=":0" />", and the [[Congress of Tamaulipas|State Congress]] decrees on April 20, 1825, to elevate the Villa de Aguayo to the category of "City",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.raullongoria.net/santander.htm|title=NUEVO SANTANDER|website=www.raullongoria.net|access-date=2018-01-25}}</ref> seat of the [[Separation of powers|Three Powers]] and [[Tamaulipas|Capital of the State]], approving the name of Victoria, in honour of the [[List of heads of state of Mexico|first President of Mexico]], [[Guadalupe Victoria]]. "The Capitality Decree, Title of City and Name" is published by mandate of the [[Congress of Tamaulipas|First Congress]], signed and sealed by Enrique Camilo Suárez, Vice [[Governor of Tamaulipas]].<ref name=":0" />

In this Capital, the [[Governor of Tamaulipas|Governor of the State]], Lucas Fernández, on May 4 issued a decree to reject the invasion by order of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish monarchy]]. The attempt of reconquest by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish vanguard army]] commanded by General [[Isidro Barradas|Brigadier Isidro Barradas]], was frustrated on September 11, 1829, in [[Tampico]], Tamaulipas; At the head of the national forces were the Generals: [[Felipe de la Garza Cisneros]], [[Governor of Tamaulipas|Manuel Mier and Terán]] and [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]]. [[Battle of Tampico (1863)]] was one of the few battles against a [[Interventionism (politics)|foreign intervention]] in Mexico where the [[Spanish Empire|invaders]] have surrendered against the [[Mexican Armed Forces|Mexican forces]].<ref name=":0" />
[[File:Básilica y plaza.jpg|thumb|Sale of flags in the month of September in the Plaza Juarez of Ciudad Victoria]]
In 1846, in the [[Mexican–American War]], Ciudad Victoria was occupied on December 25 by troops from the United States and was liberated at the end of the war.<ref name=":6"/> In 1898, [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Porfirio Díaz]] sponsored the operation of the urban animal-drawn [[Rail transport|railroad]] that ran down Hidalgo Street to the Train Station, and a branch to the Hacienda de Tamatán, properties of Colonel Manuel González Jr. and that same year the Paseo Méndez was founded, inspired by [[Paris]]ian street [[Champs-Élysées]].

=== 20th century ===
[[File:Frontview torre cristal.jpg|thumb|264x264px|Government complex built at the end of the 20th century]]
The city began its industrial transformation in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the administration of Guadalupe [[Governor of Tamaulipas|Mainero Juárez]] which attracted [[investment]]s and [[improvement]]s to the city.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Calendario Cívico de Ciudad Victoria|publisher=Gobierno Local de Ciudad Victoria}}</ref>

On September 15, 1910, the monument to the Heroes of [[Mexican War of Independence|Independence]] was inaugurated, in the "Plaza Colón" in front of the railway station "La Recoletta". In 1917 he was shot in the wall of the Municipal [[Cemetery|Pantheon]], General [[Governor of Tamaulipas|Alberto Carrera Torres]], having been tried by an [[wikt:illegal|illegal]] [[Council of war|War Council]] and buried in the [[Cemetery|French Pantheon]], and in 1923 General César López de Lara took the [[governor]]ship of the state of Tamaulipas.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gral.

== Geography ==
[[File:Panoramica sierra madre oriental.jpg|center|thumb|1285x1285px|Panoramic from a viewpoint on a hill of the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] in the Military Field of the 77th Infantry Battalion in Ciudad Victoria]]
Victoria is located {{convert|316|m}} above sea level and at coordinates {{Coord|23|44|N|99|8|W|display=inline}} just north of the [[Tropic of Cancer]]. The city is in a valley between two mountain ranges: the Sierra Madre Oriental to the west and the [[Sierra de Tamaulipas]] to the east.

=== Climate ===
Ciudad Victoria has a climate on the border of [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''/''Cwa'') and [[semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|hot semi-arid]] (''BSh''). Its weather is characterised by short warm winters and long hot to sweltering summers. Temperatures rarely drop below {{convert|0|°C}} — the lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|-6|°C|1}} and the hottest was {{convert|48.5|°C}}, one of the highest temperatures ever recorded in Mexico. The average annual rainfall is {{convert|740|mm|in|disp=or}}, of which five-sixths ({{convert|617|mm|in|1|disp=or}}) falls between May and October, although there is a drying trend in the months of July and August. The moderate elevation adds to overall rainfall pattern, which is also influenced by exceptionally heavy rains brought by occasional [[North Atlantic tropical cyclone]]s.
