'''Rybinsk''' ({{langx|ru|Рыбинск}}, {{IPA|ru|ˈrɨbʲɪnsk|IPA}}) is the second-largest [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of [[Yaroslavl Oblast]] in [[Russia]]. It lies at the [[confluence]] of the [[Volga]] and [[Sheksna]] rivers, {{convert|267|km}} north-north-east of [[Moscow]]. Population: {{ru-census | p2010= 200,771|p2002= 222,653|p1989= 251,442}}{{Historical populations|1897|25000|1926|60000|1939|144000|1959|181685|1970|218282|1979|238579|1989|251442|2002|222653|2010|200771|2021|177295|type=|footnote=Source: Census data}}

It was previously known as ''Ust-Sheksna'' (until 1504), ''Rybnaya Sloboda'' (until 1777), ''Shcherbakov'' (1946–1957), and ''Andropov'' (1984–1989).

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}

===Early history===
[[File:Рыбинск. Вид на церковь Спаса Нерукотворного Образа и город. Начало XX века.jpg|thumb|left|City center and cathedral in the 19th century]]
Rybinsk is one of the oldest Slavic settlements on the Volga River. The place was first recorded by chroniclers in 1071 as '''Ust-Sheksna''', i.e. "the mouth of the Sheksna".{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} During this period the settlement was a regional center for craft and metal based produce and for trade. In the mid-13th century, Ust-Sheksna was laid waste by [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|invading Mongols]]. For the next few centuries, the settlement was referred to alternatively as Ust-Sheksna or Rybansk. From 1504, it was identified in documents as '''Rybnaya Sloboda''' (literally: "the fishing village"). The name is explained by the fact that the settlement supplied the Muscovite court with choice [[sturgeon]]s and [[sterlet]]s. In the 17th century, when the ''[[sloboda (settlement)|sloboda]]'' was capitalizing on the trade of the [[Muscovy Company]] with Western Europe, it was rich enough to build several stone churches, of which only one survives to the present. More old architecture may be found in the neighborhood, including the last of Muscovite three-[[tented church]]es (in the Alexandrov Hermitage) and the [[Fyodor Fyodorovich Ushakov|Ushakov]] family shrine (on Epiphany Island).

===Golden age===
In the 18th century, the ''sloboda'' continued to thrive on the Volga trade. [[Catherine the Great]] granted Rybnaya Sloboda municipal rights and renamed it Rybinsk. It was a place where the cargo was reloaded from large Volga vessels to smaller boats capable of navigating in the shallow [[Mariinsk Canal system]], which connects the Russian hinterland with the [[Baltic Sea]]. With the population of 7,000, the town daily accommodated up to 170,000 sailors and up to 2,000 river vessels. Consequently, the local river port became known as the "capital of barge-haulers".
[[File:Belonogov.jpg|thumb|left|General view of Rybinsk in the 1820s]]

The town's most conspicuous landmark, the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] Savior-Transfiguration Cathedral, was constructed on the Volga riverside from 1838 until 1851. It was built to a design that the Dean of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]], [[Avraam Melnikov]], had prepared for [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] in [[Saint Petersburg|St.&nbsp;Petersburg]]. After Melnikov lost the contest for the best project of St.&nbsp;Isaac's Cathedral to [[Auguste de Montferrand]], he sold his grandiose design to the municipal authorities of Rybinsk.
[[File:Yug.jpg|thumb|left|A 19th-century photo of a monastery near Rybinsk, now submerged under the waters of the [[Rybinsk Reservoir]]]]
[[File:Rybinskbourse.jpg|thumb|left|[[List of commodities exchanges|Grain bourse]] in Rybinsk. For a more recent picture, see [[:File:Thrp03 0622 142g.jpg|this]].]]
As a trade capital of the [[Upper Volga]], Rybinsk formerly attracted scores of foreigners, who built a Lutheran church and an imposing [[Roman Catholic]] cathedral, said to be the tallest on the Volga. There is also the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Family Museum]], documenting the operations of that prominent Swedish family during the [[Russian Empire]].

20th-century American film moguls [[Nicholas Schenck]] and [[Joseph Schenck]] were born in the town, and there is a grand 18th-century mansion of the Mikhalkov family, whose living members include [[Sergey Mikhalkov]], [[Nikita Mikhalkov]], and [[Andron Konchalovsky]].

===20th century===
In the Soviet years, Rybinsk continued its impressive renaming record, for it changed its name four times: to '''Shcherbakov''' (after [[Aleksandr Shcherbakov (20th-century politician)|Aleksandr Shcherbakov]]) in 1946, back to Rybinsk in 1957, to '''Andropov''' (after [[Yuri Andropov]]) in 1984, and back to Rybinsk in 1989.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], Rybinsk serves as the [[administrative center]] of [[Rybinsky District, Yaroslavl Oblast|Rybinsky District]], even though it is not a part of it.<ref name="Ref154">Law #12-z</ref> As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the '''[[city of federal subject significance|city of oblast significance]] of Rybinsk'''—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Yaroslavl Oblast|districts]].<ref name="Ref154"/> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the city of oblast significance of Rybinsk is incorporated as '''Rybinsk Urban Okrug'''.<ref name="Ref269">Law #65-z</ref>

==Economy==
The most important industries of modern Rybinsk are [[NPO Saturn]] (two plants) AL Turborus aircraft engines, power and naval gas turbines manufacturing, RGT small plant 30 - 100 MW range gas turbines, electronics radiotronics (NPO Luch), Kalashnikov Pella Rybinsk shipyard Euroyachting, Vympel Shipyard, and a hydroelectric power station. As the experts warn,{{who|date=August 2024}} the giant Rybinsk dam which holds the [[Rybinsk Reservoir]] (formerly touted as the largest man-made body of water on Earth) places the town in the imminent danger of the dam breaking and the reservoir flooding the city.{{Citation needed|date=August 2024}} The city is served by the [[Staroselye Airport]].

==Geography==
===Climate===
Rybinsk has a four-season [[humid continental climate]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=52272&cityname=Rybinsk%2C+Central+Federal+District%2C+Russia&units=|title=Rybinsk, Russia Climate Summary|publisher=Weatherbase|access-date=24 January 2015}}</ref> with significant differences between winters and summers, although the cold winters are still significantly less severe than those found on similar parallels further east in Russia. Spring comes in the second half of March and lasts about 2 months. The weather in spring is usually dry and partly cloudy and the temperature rises quickly. Summer begins in the second half of May, but short-term returns of cold weather are possible. Summer is moderately warm and humid, lasting about three and a half months. The warmest month is July, when the weather is often hot with daytime temperatures up to +30 degrees. Autumn begins in early September, but the temperature decreases slowly, so the weather is relatively warm and sunny until the middle of the month. Later the weather becomes cloudy and it rains often. November can be either the last month of autumn, with cloudy weather and frequent rains, or the first month of winter, with frosts and stable snow cover. The yearly mean is around {{convert|5|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=52272&cityname=Rybinsk-Central-Federal-District-Russia|title=Rybinsk Temperature Averages|publisher=Weatherbase|access-date=24 January 2015}}</ref>
