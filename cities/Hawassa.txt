'''Hawassa''' ({{lang-am|አዋሳ}}; ʾäwasa, also spelled '''Awassa''' or '''Awasa''') known historically as '''Adare'''<ref>{{cite book |title=Awasa |publisher=Encyclopedia Aethiopica |url=https://en.sewasew.com/p/awasa-(%E1%8A%A0%E1%8B%8B%E1%88%B3)}}</ref> is a city in [[Ethiopia]], on the shores of [[Lake Hawassa]] in the [[Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia|Great Rift Valley]]. It is {{cvt|273|km}} south of [[Addis Ababa]] via [[Bishoftu]], {{cvt|130|km}} east of [[Sodo]], and {{cvt|75|km}} north of [[Dila, Ethiopia|Dilla]]. The town serves as the capital of the [[Sidama Region|Sidama]] Region. It lies on the [[Cairo-Cape Town Highway|Trans-African Highway 4]] [[Cairo]]-[[Cape Town]] and has a latitude and longitude of {{coord|7|3|N|38|28|E|region:ET-SN_type:city(125315)|display=inline,title}} and an elevation of {{convert|1708|meter}} above sea level. Its name comes from a Sidamic word meaning "wide body of water".

The city is home to [[Hawassa University]] a major university in the country (which includes Wondo Genet College of Forestry and Natural Resources, an Agricultural College, the Main Campus, and a Health Sciences College), Awasa Adventist College, and a major market. The city is served by [[Awasa Airport]] ([[ICAO]] code HALA, [[IATA]] AWA), opened in 1988. Postal service is provided by the main branch; electricity and telephone service are also available.<ref>[http://www.snnprbofed.gov.et/Reports/Infrastructure.xls "Detailed statistics on infrastructure"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720151514/http://www.snnprbofed.gov.et/Reports/Infrastructure.xls |date=2011-07-20 }}, Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Region, Bureau of Finance and Economic Development website (accessed 27 September 2009)</ref> Important local attractions include the St. Gabriel Church and the [[Awassa Kenema Stadium]]. [[Fishing]] is a major local industry.

Hawassa was capital of the former [[Sidamo Province]] from about 1978 until the province was abolished with the adoption of the 1995 Constitution. It then became the capital of the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region. When the Sidama Region was formed in June 2020, the city became part of that region. Hawassa currently serves as the capital of both the Sidama Region and the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region. Hawassa will continue to serve as the seat of government of the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region for two national electoral cycles, after which the regional government will move to a city within the region's boundaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://addisstandard.com/news-snnprs-council-approves-legal-framework-which-makes-hawassa-city-accountable-to-future-sidama-regional-state/|title = NEWS: SNNPRS Council approves legal framework which makes Hawassa city accountable to future Sidama Regional State|date = 18 October 2019}}</ref>

== History ==
In 1957, with Ras [[Mengesha Seyoum]] at the head of the Sidamo Governorate General, Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] became greatly interested in establishing a new town in the area where the city is now located. The area appealed to the emperor on many levels. It was located on the important Addis Abeba– Moyale (Kenya) highway; its flat, expansive topography was conducive to city building; and the nearby tourist attractions of Lake Hawassa and the Dume hill (later named Tabor) provided a dramatic backdrop to the area.

In 1958, upon the order of the emperor, a seasonal palace for him was built along [[Lake Awasa]] in an area called Kutuwa. The building of the palace intensified interest in the area among many people, most notably the empress herself proceeded to lay claim to extensive hectares of land in the name of the emperor. As the town grew, more than three thousand people who were living in the area were displaced. Dubale (2010) also notes that a political dispute accompanied the displacement of the Sidama from the Hawassa area. Governor Ras [[Mengesha Seyoum]] (r.1955–1960) enthusiastically supported the urbanization of the area, regardless of its impact on the Sidama who had been living there, while succeeding Governor Ras [[Andargachew Mesay]] (r. 1960–1965) was much more concerned with the impact of this displacement on the [[Sidama people]]. Ras Andargachew Mesay refused to endorse the implementation of a large mechanized farming project in and around the Hawassa area by the Ministry of National Development unless he was guaranteed alternative land for the thousands of Sidama households. Their houses were simply bulldozed without any prior notification and compensation. However, despite his efforts to delay or block the displacement of the Sidama by the emerging city plan and the mechanized farming scheme, the government was not deterred from its intentions and many Sidama were pushed out of the city and its surrounding areas.<ref name="addisstandard.com">{{cite web |url=https://addisstandard.com/commentary-sidama-wolayta-conflict-a-pristine-myth-turning-into-reality-hoola-halaleho/ |website=Addis Standard |title=Commentary: Sidama-Wolayta conflict: A pristine myth turning into reality? Hoola Halaleho |date=19 November 2018 }}</ref>

Following the displacement, about four hundred heads of families who served in the war against the Italian aggression from 1935–1941 were brought from [[Wukro]] and [[Korem]] (northern Ethiopia), [[Harar]] (eastern Ethiopia) and [[Addis Ababa]] and awarded land to settle in Hawassa. The places they settled still bear the names of their places of origin.<ref name="addisstandard.com"/>

In 1960 the office of the vice district governorate moved from Hawella Tulla to Hawassa. In 1962 a municipality was founded. The shift of the political center to Hawassa was not an immediate or easy decision, as there was significant opposition from the landlords in [[Yirgalem]] who benefited substantially from having the political center in their city. Initially, when Sidamaland was incorporated into the ‘modern Ethiopian empire’, the political center had been at Hagereselam (85 kilometres from Hawassa); during Ras Desta Damtew’s reign the center shifted to [[Yirgalem]] in 1941. In the brief period of the Italian occupation, the Italians shifted the center to Aposto, a small roadside town located at the entrance of Yirgalem town and along the paved road connecting Addis Abeba and Moyale (Kenya).<ref name="addisstandard.com"/>

Finally, the political center shifted to Hawassa in 1968; until the fall of the imperial regime in 1974, it served as a capital of the Sidamo Governorate General (Sidamo Teklay Gizat), which included Sidama, Wolayta, Gedeo, Jemjem, Borena and Arero. In 1974, the [[Derg]] military regime established Hawassa as the capital of its Sidamo district (Kifle Hager). Later on during the transitional government Hawassa became a capital of region 8 and soon after as a capital of [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region]] and later the [[Sidama Region]].<ref name="addisstandard.com"/>

The city of Hawassa is one of the fast-growing cities in the region and it has a city administration consisting of eight sub-cities and urban as well as rural kebeles.  The sub cities are named as Addis Ketema, Hayk Dar, Bahil Adarash, Misrak, Menahreya, Tabor, Mehal Ketema and Tula.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The city of Hawassa |url=https://visitsidama.travel/destination/the-city-of-hawassa/ |access-date=2023-11-25 |website=Sidama Region Culture, Tourism& sport Bureau |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Economy ===
The [[Hawassa Industrial Park]] (HIP) is an [[eco-industrial park]] situated on the outskirts of the city. It was established on 13 July 2016<ref>{{Cite web |last=Fortune |first=Addis |title=Hawassa Industrial Park to be Inaugurated this Week |url=https://addisfortune.net/articles/hawassa-industrial-park-to-be-inaugurated-this-week/ |access-date=2022-09-21 |website=addisfortune.net |language=en}}</ref> and inaugurated by [[Prime Minister of Ethiopia|Prime Minister]] [[Hailemariam Desalegn]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-07-22 |title=Hawassa Industrial Park goes fully operational as Ethiopia pushes to become manufacturing hub |url=https://www.ethioembassy.org.uk/hawassa-industrial-park-goes-fully-operational-as-ethiopia-pushes-to-become-manufacturing-hub/ |access-date=2022-09-21 |website=Embassy of Ethiopia, London |language=en-US}}</ref> Focusing on apparel and fabric production, the government-backed initiative initially covered 130 hectares, offering the possibility to expand up to a total of 400 hectares. The park features a [[zero liquid discharge]] (ZLD) facility, enabling companies to meet stringent environmental standards required by international markets.<ref>{{Cite web |date=21 September 2022 |title=Hawassa Industrial Park |url=https://www.grips.ac.jp/forum/af-growth/support_ethiopia/document/2017.02_ET_AW/HIP_ohnoE4.pdf}}</ref>

[[File:Hawassa_Univesity.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hawassa University]]'s main campus|289x289px]]

At its peak, the Hawassa Industrial Park employed over 35,000 workers.<ref name="texfash">{{Cite web |date=July 2022 |title=Ethiopia's Hawassa Industrial Park Stares at Massive Job Losses Over US Decision |url=https://texfash.com/update/ethiopias-hawassa-industrial-park-stares-at-massive-job-losses-over-us-decision}}</ref> The park faced significant challenges in 2022 due to factory closures and job losses following the United States government's decision to remove Ethiopia from the [[African Growth and Opportunity Act]]'s duty-free access to US markets.<ref name="texfash"/> However, between October 2022 and January 2023, the park generated 32 million USD in revenue, indicating a potential revival of the sector following the [[Ethiopia–Tigray peace agreement|Pretoria peace agreement]].<ref name="fanabc">{{Cite web |date=10 January 2023 |title=Hawassa Industrial Park Generates $32mln In 3 Months |url=https://www.fanabc.com/english/hawassa-industrial-park-generates-32mln-in-3-months/}}</ref>

=== Religion ===
52.71% of the population said they were [[P'ent'ay|Protestants]], 39.99% practiced [[Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity]], 7.30% were [[Islam in Ethiopia|Muslim]] and 3.78% embraced [[Roman Catholicism in Ethiopia|Catholicism]].<ref>[http://www.csa.gov.et/index.php?option=com_rubberdoc&view=doc&id=273&format=raw&Itemid=521 Census 2007 Tables: Southern Peoples, Nations and Nationalities Region] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113220306/http://www.csa.gov.et/index.php?option=com_rubberdoc&view=doc&id=273&format=raw&Itemid=521 |date=November 13, 2012 }}, Tables 2.1, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4.</ref>
The Latin Catholic minority is pastorally served by the missionary [[Apostolic Vicariate of Awasa]], which has its [[Cathedral]] of Kidane-Meheret here.

==Sport==
Football (soccer) and swimming are the most played games in Hawassa. [[Hawassa City S.C.]] ({{Lang-am|ሀዋሳ ከተማ}}), a football club based in Hawassa—like [[Debub Police S.C.]] and [[Sidama Coffee S.C.]]—and using the [[Awassa Kenema Stadium]], was the first to win the [[Ethiopian Premier League]] from outside of Addis Ababa, the capital. In addition to winning the league twice, the club took part twice in [[CAF Champions League]]. Other sports like basketball—represented by [[Hawassa City BC]]—and skateboarding are becoming popular among the youth. Biking and running competitions are occasionally held on the main streets of the town.

==Education==
[[Hawassa University]], established in 1999 through the merger of a number of higher education institutions, is based in the city. Info link College is the first private engineering college found in Hawassa. 
[[Africa Beza College]] campus is also in the city. Hawassa University is the first university in Ethiopia to offer a Hotel Management degree program.

==Climate==
Hawassa has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Aw'') though it borders on a [[subtropical highland climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cwb''). There are two seasons: a lengthy though not intense [[wet season]] from March to October and a short [[dry season]] from November to February. The extra cloudiness of the wet season is sufficient to make it substantially cooler than the dry season despite a higher sun angle; however, the coolest morning temperatures, often close to freezing, occur during the dry season.
