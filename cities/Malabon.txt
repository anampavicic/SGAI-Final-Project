'''Malabon''', officially the '''City of Malabon''' ({{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Malabon}}), is a [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|highly urbanized city]] in the [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]] of the [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 380,522 people.{{PH census|current}}

Located just north of the city of [[Manila]], it is primarily a residential and industrial area, and is one of the most densely populated cities in the metropolis. It has a total land area of {{convert|15.96|sqkm|sp=us}}.

Malabon is part of the sub-region of Metro Manila informally called [[Administrative divisions of Metro Manila#Districts|CAMANAVA]], an area which derives its name from the first syllable of its component cities: [[Caloocan]], Malabon, [[Navotas]], and [[Valenzuela, Philippines|Valenzuela]]. Caloocan lies to the south and east, Navotas to the west, and Valenzuela to the north. Malabon also borders the town of [[Obando, Bulacan|Obando]] in the province of [[Bulacan]] to the northwest.

== Etymology ==
The name Malabon is from [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word ''malabon'', meaning "having many [[silt deposit]]s". The name was previously also used for two other places in [[Cavite]] during the early [[History of the Philippines (1565–1898)|Spanish colonial period]]: Santa Cruz de Malabon (now [[Tanza, Cavite|Tanza]]) and San Francisco de Malabon (now [[General Trias, Cavite|General Trias]]).<ref name="Lesho">{{cite book |last1=Lesho |first1=Marivic |last2=Sippola |first2=Eeva |title=Vergleichende Kolonialtoponomastik Strukturen und Funktionen kolonialer Ortsbenennung |date=2018 |publisher=De Gruyter |chapter=Toponyms in Manila and Cavite, Philippines |isbn=9783110608618 |pages=317–332}}</ref> It is previously named as Tambobong, after the rural Tagalog word ''tambúbong'', which translates to barn.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hispanicindio.wordpress.com/2020/01/12/when-malabon-was-the-half-mestizo-tambobong/|title=When Malabon was the Half-Mestizo Tambobong|last=Filipina|first=Hispanidad|date=January 12, 2020|website=The Hispanic Indio|language=en|access-date=January 19, 2020}}</ref>

== History ==
===Spanish rule===
Originally called '''Tambobong''', Malabon was founded as a ''visita'' (hamlet) of Tondo by the [[Order of Saint Augustine|Augustinians]] on May 21, 1599.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} It remained under the administrative jurisdiction of the [[Manila (province)|Province of Tondo]] (renamed to Manila in 1859) from 1627 to 1688.

Malabon played an important economic role in the late 19th century with the founding of ''[[La Princesa Tabacalera]]'' tobacco company in 1851 and the [[Malabon Sugar Company]] in 1878. La Princesa was under the corporate umbrella of ''[[Compañia General de Tabacos de Filipinas]]'' (owned by the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish Crown]]), while the latter pioneered the [[refined sugar]] industry in the Philippines.

In 1859, three barrios—San Jose, Navotas, and Bangkulasi—were separated from Tambobong to form a new town that is now [[Navotas]].<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=https://www.navotas.gov.ph/OurCity/History|title=Our History|website=Navotas City|accessdate=August 1, 2023}}</ref>

The newspaper ''La Independencia'' was first printed in Malabon's ''Asilo de Huérfanos'' (Orphanage), where children orphaned by the Plague of 1882 were housed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=police03_april01_2006|title=manilastandardtoday.com, Malabon City: A sight of progress}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wikimapia.org/576454/Malabon-City-Hall|title=Malabon City Hall – Malabon|website=wikimapia.org}}</ref>

===American rule===
The first [[Mayor of Malabon]] was ''[[Don (honorific)|Don]]'' Agustín Salamante, a Spanish ''[[Filipino mestizo|mestizo]]''{{citation needed|date=April 2021}} originally from [[Cavite]]. The first Filipino Mayor of Malabon was Don Vicente P. Villongco, in 1899 during the onset of the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American regime]].{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

Malabon was officially made a municipality of the newly created [[Rizal (province)|Province of Rizal]] on June 11, 1901, by virtue of Philippine Commission Act No. 137.<ref>{{Cite PH act|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l2485 |date=June 11, 1901 |title=An Act Extending the Provisions of the Provincial Government Act to the Province of Rizal |chamber=Act |number=942}}</ref> From 1903 to 1906, [[Navotas]] was returned to Malabon to form a single municipality.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l89ad|number=942|date=October 12, 1903|accessdate=June 19, 2022|title=An Act Reducing the Thirty-Two Municipalities of the Province of Rizal to Fifteen}}</ref><ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l3c89|number=1442|date=January 16, 1906|accessdate=April 24, 2022|title=AN ACT Increasing the number of municipalities in the Province of Rizal from sixteen, as established by Act Numbered Nine hundred and forty-two, as amended, to seventeen, by making Malabon and Navotas separate municipalities, and transferring the former municipality of Baras from the municipality of Morong to the municipality of Tanay.}}</ref>

===Since independence and cityhood ===
Malabon remained a municipality of Rizal until November 7, 1975, when Malabon became a part of the National Capital Region or [[Metro Manila]] by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 824.<ref name="PD824">{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1975/pd_824_1975.html|title=Presidential Decree No. 824 November 7, 1975.

Malabon became a highly urbanized city on April 21, 2001, under Republic Act No. 9019, 407 years after its founding.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=RA|number=9019|title=An Act Converting the Municipality of Malabon Into a Highly Urbanized City To Be Known as The City of Malabon |url=https://lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2001/ra_9019_2001.html |publisher=The Lawphil Project - [[Arellano University School of Law|Arellano Law Foundation, Inc.]] |access-date=July 10, 2020 |date=March 5, 2001}}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:Artex Compound houses.jpg|thumb|left|The permanently flooded area at the Artex Compound in Barangay Dampalit]]
Malabon is one of the most densely populated cities in the Philippines and its low-lying, flat terrain makes it prone to frequent flooding, especially during high tides, heavy rains and when river and dams overflow. The four cities in CAMANAVA are commonly affected by interconnected rivers, one of which is the [[Tullahan River]].

The river system used to be navigable, and fishing was the major livelihood activity in the area. The river used to be wider and deeper with better quality water, and was a regular source of different species of fish, an important food source for local residents. Also, trees and crops like ''palay'' (rice) and vegetables used to be grown along the riverbanks. However, these agricultural plots have been replaced by industrial yards, which also became home to thousands of informal settlers who built makeshift dwellings without legal claim to the land.

Floods have worsened in recent years, occurring more frequently and reaching depths of several feet. Most affected are families in the communities that are along or near the riverbanks. The river has become narrower and shallower over the years, and its capacity to hold water has decreased. With more frequent intense rains, the riverbanks flood regularly and flooding reaches farther into low-lying and densely populated areas of the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cdkn.org/resource/understanding-risk-flooding-barangay-potrero-metro-manila?loclang=en_gb|title=INSIDE STORY: Understanding the risk of flooding in the city: The case of Barangay Potrero, Metro Manila &#124; Climate & Development Knowledge Network|website=cdkn.org|date=February 4, 2015 }}</ref>
