'''Adamawa State''' is a [[States of Nigeria|state]] in the [[North East (Nigeria)|North-East geopolitical zone]] of [[Nigeria]], bordered by [[Borno State|Borno]] to the northwest, [[Gombe State|Gombe]] to the west, and [[Taraba State|Taraba]] to the southwest while its eastern border forms part of the national [[Cameroon-Nigeria border|border with]] [[Cameroon]]. It takes its name from the historic [[Adamawa Emirate|emirate of Adamawa]], with the emirate's old capital of [[Yola, Adamawa|Yola]] serving as the capital city of Adamawa State. The state was formed in 1991 when the former [[Gongola State]] was broken up into Adamawa and [[Taraba State|Taraba]] states.<ref>{{cite web |title=This is how the 36 states were created |url=https://www.pulse.ng/news/local/nigerian-states-this-is-how-the-36-states-were-created/mdtnq3e |website=Pulse.ng |date=October 24, 2017 |access-date=15 December 2021}}</ref> The state is one of the most heterogeneous in Nigeria, having over 100 indigenous ethnic groups.

Of the [[States of Nigeria|36 states]], Adamawa is the [[List of Nigerian states by area|eighth largest in the area]], but the [[List of Nigerian states by population|thirteenth least populous]] with an estimated population of about 4.25 million as of 2016.<ref>{{cite web |title=Population 2006-2016 |url=https://nigerianstat.gov.ng/elibrary/read/474 |website=[[National Bureau of Statistics, Nigeria|National Bureau of Statistics]] |access-date=14 December 2021}}</ref> Geographically, the state is mainly composed of highlands and mountains (the [[Atlantika Mountains|Atlantika]], [[Mandara Mountains|Mandara]], and the [[Shebshi Mountains|Shebshi]] ranges) and the [[Adamawa Plateau]] crossed by valleys and rivers, most notably the [[Benue River|Benue]] and [[Gongola River|Gongola]] rivers. The lowlands of Adamawa are part of the [[West Sudanian savanna]] in the north and the wetter [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]] in parts of the south, while elevated areas are parts of the [[Mandara Plateau mosaic]] and [[Cameroonian Highlands forests]] [[List of ecoregions in Nigeria|ecoregions]]. In the extreme south of the state is part of the [[Gashaka Gumti National Park]], a large wildlife park that contains large populations of [[bushbuck]], [[African buffalo]], [[patas monkey]], [[black-and-white colobus]], [[giant pangolin]], and [[hippopotamus]] along with some of Nigeria's last remaining [[Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee]], [[African leopard]], and [[African golden cat]] populations.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sani Kona |first1=Lawal |title=Photos: Can helping local people save an embattled Nigerian park? |url=https://news.mongabay.com/2016/01/photos-can-helping-local-people-save-an-embattled-nigerian-park/ |website=[[Mongabay]] |date=20 January 2016 |access-date=15 December 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Briggs |first1=Helen |title=Wildlife secrets of Nigeria's last wilderness |work=BBC News |date=23 February 2018 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-42993333 |access-date=15 December 2021}}</ref>

What is now known as Adamawa state has been inhabited for years by various ethnic groups, including the [[Bwatiye languages|Bwatiye (Bachama)]], [[Bali people (Nigeria)|Bali]], Bata (Gbwata), [[Gudu]], [[Mbula-Bwazza language|Mbula-Bwazza]], and Nungurab (Lunguda) in the central region; the [[Kamwe language#People|Kamwe]] in the north and central region; the [[Jibu language|Jibu]] in the far south; the [[Kilba people|Kilba]], [[Matakam people|Mafa]], [[Marghi people|Marghi]], and Waga in the north, and the [[Mumuye people|Mumuye]] in the south while the [[Fula people|Fulani]] live throughout the state ‚Äî often as [[Fulani herdsmen|nomadic herders]]. Adamawa is also religiously diverse as about 50% of the population is [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Muslim and 40% is Christian (mainly [[Lutheran Church of Christ in Nigeria|Lutheran]], [[Church of the Brethren in Nigeria|EYN]], [[Evangelical Church Winning All|ECWA]], and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]]), while the remaining 10% are adherents of traditional ethnic religions.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Roelofs |first1=Portia |title=Civil Society, Religion and the State: Mapping of Borno and Adamawa |url=http://www.portiaroelofs.com/uploads/1/0/5/8/105875819/stakeholder_analysis_borno_and_adamawa.pdf |publisher=[[Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit]] |access-date=18 January 2022 |location=[[Abuja]] |date=November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nwankwo |first1=Cletus Famous |title=Religion and Voter Choice Homogeneity in the Nigerian Presidential Elections of the Fourth Republic |journal=Statistics, Politics and Policy |date=27 March 2019 |volume=10 |pages=1‚Äì25 |doi=10.1515/spp-2018-0010 |s2cid=159290972 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331532913 |access-date=19 January 2022}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|Adamawa Emirate}}

[[File:Hausa from Yola-1902.jpg|thumb|366x366px|Illustration by Edmund D. Morel titled "A Hausa from Yola" (1902)]]
Before it became a state in Nigeria, Adamawa was a subordinate kingdom of the [[Sultanate of Sokoto]], which also included much of northern [[Cameroon]]. The rulers bear the title of [[emir]] ("{{lang|fub|lamido}}" in the local language, [[Fulfulde]]).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hamid|first=Bobby|title=Adamawa emirate 1809 - 2009: A documentary source book|publisher=Centre for Regional integration|year=2009|pages=35‚Äì50}}</ref>

The name "Adamawa" came from the founder of the kingdom, [[Modibo Adama]], a regional leader of the [[Fula jihads|Fulani Jihad]] organized by [[Usman dan Fodio]] of Sokoto in 1804. [[Modibo Adama]] came from the region of Gurin (now just a small village) and in 1806, received a green flag for leading the jihad in his native country. In the following years, Adama conquered many lands and tribes. In 1838, he moved his capital to Ribadu, and in 1839, to Joboliwo. In 1841, he founded [[Yola, Nigeria|Yola]], where he died in 1848. After the [[History of colonialism|European colonization]] (first by [[Germany]] and then by [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]), the rulers remained as emirs and the line of succession has continued to the present day.
[[File:Adamawa state contingent 1.jpg|thumb|Dancers of Adamawa state in their cultural adornment|237x237px]]

In the early 1800s, the [[Fulani jihad]] seized much of modern-day Adamawa State and formed the [[Adamawa Emirate]] under the [[Sokoto Caliphate]]. About 90 years later, forces from [[German Kamerun|Germany]] and the [[British Empire]] defeated the Emirate in the [[Adamawa Wars]] and split the area. The British-controlled area (much of the west of modern-day Adamawa) was incorporated into the [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate]] which later merged into [[British Nigeria]] before becoming independent as [[Nigeria]] in 1960. The German-controlled area formed a part of [[German Kamerun]] until [[Allies of World War I|allied forces]] invaded and occupied Kamerun during the [[Kamerun campaign]] of [[World War I]]. After the war, what is now eastern Adamawa State became most of the [[Northern Cameroons]] within the [[British Cameroons]] until 1961, when a [[1961 British Cameroons referendum|referendum]] led to a merger with [[Nigeria]].

Originally, modern-day Adamawa State was a part of the post-independence [[Northern Region, Nigeria|Northern Region]] until 1967 when the area became part of the [[North-Eastern State]]. After the North-Eastern State was split in 1976, [[Gongola State]] was formed on 3 February 1976 alongside ten other states. Fifteen years after statehood, Gongola was split with the state's south becoming [[Taraba State]] while its north became Adamawa State.

A [[measles]] outbreak was reported in an [[internally displaced person]]s camp, in January 2015.<ref>{{cite news |author=Mohammed Ismail |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201501160208.html |title=Nigeria: Adamawa IDPs' Camps Record Outbreak of Measles |publisher=AllAfrica |date=16 January 2015}}</ref>

=== Boko Haram insurgency ===
Adamawa State has been badly impacted by the Boko Haram insurgency. In January 2012, Boko Haram [[January 2012 Northern Nigeria attacks|attacked]] [[Gombi]], [[Mubi (town)|Mubi]] and [[Yola, Nigeria|Yola]]. By 2014, the state became home to camps housing an estimated 35,000 internally displaced people, fleeing violence from Boko Haram in locations including Mubi, [[Madagali]], [[Askira uba|Askira Uba]], [[Bama, Nigeria|Bama]] and [[Gwoza]] in the states of Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe. In 2014, an estimate placed the number of IDPs around Yola at 400,000.<ref name="Deliver Relief">{{cite news |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201411210306.html |title=Nigeria: U.S., UK, American University Deliver Relief Materials to Adamawa Displaced Persons |date=20 November 2014 |publisher=Channels Television}}{{subscription required}}</ref> [[January 2014 Northern Nigeria attacks|An attack]] occurred in Chakawa in 2014.

=== Climate change ===
[[File:Flooded sunrise in Yola.jpg|thumb|360x360px|Global warming has had a negative impact on climate and weather patterns as is visible here with the River Gongola flooding some households and farmlands in Yola.]]
A study conducted on climate in 2012 in Nigeria's Adamawa state revealed monthly mean temperature rise in Gyawana, Yola, and Mubi, while annual rainfall declined. Delays in rainfall and reduced length of fall were observed in these areas.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Adebayo |last2=Zemba |last3=Ray |last4=Dayya |first1=A.A. |first2=A.A. |first3=H.H. |first4=S.V. |date=2012 |title=Climate change in Adamawa State Nigeria: Evidence from Agro-Climatic Parameters |journal=Adamawa State University Journal of Scientific Research |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=1‚Äì18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Adamawa weather and climate ‚òÄÔ∏è Best time to visit üå°Ô∏è Temperature |url=https://www.besttravelmonths.com/nigeria/adamawa-4042922/ |access-date=2023-08-06 |website=www.besttravelmonths.com |language=en}}</ref>

Contrarily, in recent times, the [[humidity]] and temperature of Adamawa state, especially during the dry season, begins in November, which is usually very hot. The [[harmattan]] period is experienced between December and February every year.<ref name="Mamman Oyebanji Petters"/>

In recent years, the effect of [[climate change]] has begun to be more evident. [[Tropical rainforest|Tropical]] wet and dry weather prevails in Adamawa State. The wet season lasts from April to October, whereas the dry season lasts for at least five months (November to March) yearly.

==Economy==
[[File:Mandara Mountains from Yola.jpg|300px|thumb|Mandara Mountains from Yola]]
Adamawa has vast arable land for agriculture, waterfalls and landscape, and solid minerals like [[limestone]], [[tantalite]] and [[Kaolinite|kaoline]]. The [[GDP]] of the state is estimated to be ‚Ç¶2.66 trillion. It has the 18th largest economy among the 36 [[states of Nigeria]] and the largest in the [[North East (Nigeria)|North-East]] region. The total [[revenue]] of the state experienced a growth of 9.93% from around ‚Ç¶700.602 billion in 2020 to ‚Ç¶777.62 billion in 2021.

The state imported $25.02 million worth of goods between 2019 and 2021. It has a debt stock of ‚Ç¶132.68 billion as of December 2021, ranking the 19th most indebted state in Nigeria and 2nd most indebted in the [[North East (Nigeria)|North-East]].<ref name=":1" />

The [[Dangote Group|Dangote group]] operates a sugar production factory in [[Numan, Nigeria|Numan]] which has a sugar refining capacity of 3,000 tonnes of cane per day. The company announced plans to expand to factory to a capacity of 6,000tcd, 9,800tcd and to 15,000 tcd. They also plan to increase the size of the factory from 8,700 hectares in 2022 to about 24,200 hectares within seven years.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dan-Awoh |first=Deborah |date=2022-11-22 |title=Dangote Sugar Refinery boosts investments |url=https://punchng.com/dangote-sugar-refinery-boosts-investments/ |access-date=2023-05-10 |website=Punch Newspapers |language=en-US}}</ref>

The markets found in the state are incredibly important to its economic activity and to its inhabitants. These markets, especially its cattle markets, enhanced the development of economic activities in the state, [[Cash crop|cash crops]] like [[Peanut|groundnut]] and [[Bean|beans]] are grown and crops like [[rice]], [[maize]] and [[sorghum]] are grown as food crops. Around [[Yedseram River valley|River Yedseram]] and its tributaries, vegetable gardening in the dry season is practised. Fishing is also very popular in the riverine areas. The breeds of cattle found in Adamawa are; [[Adamawa cattle|Adamawa Gudali]], Sokoto Gudali, [[White Fulani]], Ambala, Red Sokoto and [[Red Fulani]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal |last1=Dzarma |first1=Daniel James |last2=Hamawa |first2=Modibbo Ishaku |date=May 2020 |title=Economics of Cattle Marketing In Mubi Area of Adamawa State, Nigeria |url=https://www.wjir.org/download_data/WJIR0805019.pdf |journal=World Journal of Innovative Research (WJIR) |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=97‚Äì103}}</ref> The state has around 1.5 million cattle and 64 grazing reserves of which 30 are gazetted.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cattle colonies: Adamawa Govt. registers 64 grazing reserves |url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/nnorth-east/206654-adamawa-establishes-30-grazing-reserves-1-5-million-cows.html?tztc=1 |access-date=2023-05-11 |website=www.premiumtimesng.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Adamawa establishes 30 grazing reserves for 1.5 million cows |url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/nnorth-east/206654-adamawa-establishes-30-grazing-reserves-1-5-million-cows.html?tztc=1 |access-date=2023-05-11 |website=www.premiumtimesng.com}}</ref>

Adamawa state has a thriving [[livestock]] industry especially cattle-rearing. It has 2.5 million heads of cattle. Traders come from all over the country and West Africa to buy and sell cattle in its markets, such as the Mubi International cattle market in [[Mubi South]]. Despite the state's high level of cattle production, the markets are poorly developed without essential services like meat processing. Meaning, live animals have to be transported in trucks for 4 days before they reach cities with high demand to regions like the [[South West (Nigeria)|South-West]], [[South South|South-South]] or [[South East (Nigeria)|South-East]] Nigeria.<ref name=":2" />

The development of many communities in the state can be traced to the colonial era when the Germans ruled a swath of territory known as the Northern and Southern [[Kamerun]]s from [[Dikwa]] in the North to Victoria ([[Limbe, Cameroon|Limbe]]) on the Atlantic coast in the 19th century. These were, however, handed over as [[United Nations Trust Territories]] to the British at the end of the [[World War I]] with the signing of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. After a series of referendums, the Northern Kameruns joined Nigeria to form the then Sardauna Province and the Southern Kameruns formed a Confederation with French-speaking Cameroon.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gongola State Government|title=Gongola at a Glance|year=1989}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Udo|first=R.K|title=Geographical Regions of Nigeria|publisher=Heinemann|year=1970}}</ref>
