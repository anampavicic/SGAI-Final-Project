Its [[administrative center]] is the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of [[Kurgan, Kurgan Oblast|Kurgan]]. According to the [[Russian Census (2021)|2021 Census]], the population was 776,661,<ref name="2021Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2021Census}}</ref> down from&nbsp;910,807 recorded in the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Census]].<ref name="2010Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2010Census}}</ref>

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2020}}
Formed by Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of February 6, 1943. The region included 32 districts of the eastern part of the Chelyabinsk region and 4 districts of the Omsk region with a total population of 975,000.
 	
Recipient of the [[Order of Lenin]] (1959).

==Geography==
Kurgan Oblast is located in Southern Russia and is part of the [[Urals Federal District]]. It shares borders with [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]] to the west, [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]] to the north-west, [[Tyumen Oblast]] to the north-east, and [[Kazakhstan]] ([[Kostanay Region|Kostanay]] and [[North Kazakhstan Region]]) to the south. Lakes [[Medvezhye (Kurgan Oblast)|Medvezhye]] and [[Filatovo (lake)|Filatovo]] are located in the district.<ref name="STM">{{cite web|url=https://maps.vlasenko.net/smtm1000/n-42.jpg|title=N-42 Topographic Chart (in Russian)|access-date=14 August 2024}}</ref>

===Climate===
The oblast has a severe continental climate with long cold winters and warm summers with regular droughts. The average January temperature is {{convert|-18|C}}, and the average temperature in the warmest month (July) is {{convert|+19|C}}. Annual precipitation is about {{convert|400|mm|sp=us}}.<ref name="Kurgan Region">[http://www.kommersant.com/t-49/r_5/n_392/Kurgan_Region/ Kurgan Region] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127031724/http://www.kommersant.com/t-49/r_5/n_392/Kurgan_Region/ |date=November 27, 2010 }}</ref>

==Politics==
{{see also|Governor of Kurgan Oblast}}

During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Kurgan CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

The Charter of Kurgan Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The [[Kurgan Oblast Duma]] is the province's standing legislative (representative) body. The Oblast Duma consists of 34 members and exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].

After the last elections held in 2015 the [[United Russia]] Party currently holds the majority of seats in the Oblast Duma. Elections of deputies of the Kurgan Regional Duma of the VII convocation are scheduled for 2020.

==Economy==
Kurgan Oblast borders on the oil- and gas-bearing districts of [[Tyumen Oblast]] and is also close to similar districts in [[Tomsk Oblast]]. Large [[oil]] and [[Natural gas|gas]] pipelines pass through its territory, and [[Ural (region)|Ural]] and Siberian oil refineries are fairly close. The main industrial centers are [[Kurgan, Kurgan Oblast|Kurgan]], and [[Shadrinsk]].<ref name="Kurgan Region"/>

The oblast does not have large economic mineral reserves; therefore, it has developed mainly on the basis of subindustries associated with processing of [[agricultural production]] and assembly and packaging of finished products. The [[food industry]] is well developed here, with [[meat]]-packing plants, [[Mill (grinding)|mill]]s, [[creameries]], and [[powdered milk]] factories.<ref name="Kurgan Region"/>

Modern large-scale industry began developing during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]], when sixteen enterprises from western regions of the country were evacuated here in 1941–1942.
