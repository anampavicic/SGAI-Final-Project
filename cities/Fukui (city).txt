==History==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}
===Origins===
Fukui originally consisted of the [[Old provinces of Japan|old provinces]] of [[Wakasa Province|Wakasa]] and [[Echizen Province|Echizen]], before the prefecture was formed in 1871.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Japan Encyclopedia | isbn=978-0-674-01753-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&pg=PA780 | author1=Louis-Frédéric | date=2002 | publisher=Harvard University Press }}</ref>

During the [[Edo period]], the ''[[daimyō]]'' of the region was surnamed [[Matsudaira]], and was a descendant of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Japan Encyclopedia | isbn=978-0-674-01753-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&pg=PA780 | author1=Louis-Frédéric | date=2002 | publisher=Harvard University Press }}</ref>

===Sengoku period===
In 1471, Asakura had displaced the [[Shiba clan]] as the ''[[shugo]]'' military commander of [[Echizen Province]].<ref name="enc">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Japan |title=Asakura Yoshikage |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |access-date=2012-08-22 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |oclc=56431036 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archive-date=2007-08-25 }}</ref> The same year, [[Asakura Toshikage]] (1428–1481) fortified the Ichijōdani by constructing hilltop fortifications on the surrounding mountains and constructing walls and gates to seal off the northern and southern end of the valley. Within this area, he contracted a fortified mansion, surrounded by the homes of his relatives and retainers, and eventually by the residences of merchants and artisans, and Buddhist temples. He offered refuge to people of culture or skills from Kyoto attempting to escape the conflict of the [[Ōnin War]], and the Ichijōdani became a major cultural, military, and population center, and by the time of Asakura Takakage (1493–1548) it had a peak population of over 10,000 inhabitants. Yoshikage succeeded his father as head of the Asakura clan and castle lord of Ichijōdani Castle in 1548.<ref name="jinmei">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Nihon Jinmei Daijiten (日本人名大辞典)|title=朝倉 義景|url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/|access-date=2012-08-22|year=2012|publisher=Shogakukan|location=Tokyo|language=Japanese|trans-title=Asakura Yoshikage|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/|archive-date=2007-08-25}}</ref><ref name="kokugo">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Nihon Kokugo Daijiten|title=朝倉 義景|trans-title=Asakura Yoshikage|url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/|access-date=2012-08-22|year=2012|publisher=Shogakukan|location=Tokyo|language=Japanese|oclc=56431036|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/|archive-date=2007-08-25}}</ref>

The Asakura maintained good relations with the [[Ashikaga shogunate]], and thus eventually came into conflict with [[Oda Nobunaga]]. Following Nobunaga's capture of [[Kyoto]], [[Shōgun]] [[Ashikaga Yoshiaki]] appointed [[Asakura Yoshikage]] as regent and requested aid in driving Nobunaga out of the capital.<ref name="kokushi">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Kokushi Daijiten |title=朝倉 義景 |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |access-date=2012-08-22 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |language=Japanese |trans-title=Asakura Yoshikage |oclc=683276033 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archive-date=2007-08-25 }}</ref> As a result, Nobunaga launched an invasion of [[Echizen Province]].

[[Kitanosho Castle]] is known, though that it was built by [[Shibata Katsuie]] in 1575. Also, it appears that the ''[[tenshu]]'' (keep) was nine stories high, making it the largest of the time.
