'''Pontianak''', also known as '''Khuntien''' in [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], is the capital of the Indonesian province of [[West Kalimantan]], founded first as a trading port on the island of [[Borneo]], occupying an area of 118.21&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in the [[river delta|delta]] of the [[Kapuas River]], at a point where it is joined by its major tributary, the Landak River. The city is on the [[equator]], hence it is widely known as Kota Khatulistiwa (Equatorial City). The city center is less than {{convert|3|km|mi|0}} south of the equator. Pontianak is the 23rd most populous city in [[Indonesia]] (as at 2023), and the fourth most populous city on the island of [[Borneo]] (Kalimantan) after [[Samarinda]], [[Balikpapan]] and (Malaysia's) [[Kuching]]; it is now slightly ahead of [[Banjarmasin]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Omed|first=Kata|date=2020-05-25|title=Daftar 10 Kota Besar di Kalimantan|url=https://kataomed.com/kota/daftar-10-kota-besar-di-kalimantan|access-date=2021-06-19|website=KATA OMED|language=en-GB}}</ref> It had a population of 658,685 at the 2020 Census<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> within the city limits, with significant suburbs outside those limits. The official estimate as of mid-2023 was 675,468 (comprising 337,856 males and 337,612 females).<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024"/>

The city was founded as a small Malay fishing village at the mouth of the Kapuas River. It then became the seat of the [[Pontianak Sultanate]] for several centuries. Pontianak was then incorporated into the [[Dutch East Indies]] after an agreement between the [[Pontianak Sultanate]] and the Dutch Government. During the colonial era, Pontianak was the seat of the ''[[Residentie Westerafdeeling van Borneo]]'', one of the residencies of the [[Dutch East Indies]].

When the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese occupied the Dutch East Indies]], Pontianak became the site of the [[Pontianak massacre]], in which many Malay aristocrats and sultans as well as people from other ethnic groups (Particularly high profile Arabs and Chinese) were massacred by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], especially in the [[Massacre of Mandor]] (Holocaust of Mandor).

After the Japanese surrendered, Pontianak became part of the [[Republic of Indonesia]] and was designated as the capital city of the province of [[West Kalimantan]].

Pontianak is a multicultural city, as different ethnic groups such as the [[Dayak people|Dayak]], [[Malay Indonesian|Malay]], Bugis people, and [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]] live in the city, with some immigrants such as Javanese, Madura people, Bataks, Ambon people, Papuans, and Manado people. This has created a culture that cannot be found in other parts of Indonesia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}} Various languages are spoken in Pontianak, such as [[Pontianak Malay]], [[Dayak language]] and different dialects of [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese]] and some varieties of Malays, Dayaks, Javanese, Bataks, and Bugis.

Pontianak is connected by air to other cities of Indonesia as well as some cities in [[Malaysia]] such as [[Kuala Lumpur]] and Kuching. Connected with the [[Supadio International Airport]]. Well paved roads of the Trans Kalimantan Road connect Pontianak to all Cities in the [[Kalimantan]], such as [[Palangkaraya]], [[Banjarmasin]], [[Balikpapan]], [[Samarinda]], and [[Tanjung Selor]].  other towns also connected in the Province of [[West Kalimantan]], such as [[Ketapang (Kalimantan)|Ketapang]], [[Singkawang]], [[Sintang]], etc., as well as other provinces. As Pontianak lies on the [[Trans-Kalimantan Highway Southern Route|Trans Kalimantan Highway]], it is possible to travel to [[East Malaysia]] and [[Brunei]] by land using the Trans Kalimantan Highway. Several bus routes operate from Pontianak to [[Kuching]] in [[Malaysia]] and [[Bandar Seri Begawan]] in [[Brunei Darussalam]].

== Etymology ==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Straatgezicht met watertonnen TMnr 60014537.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Pontianak, around 1920]]The city was formerly the capital of the independent [[Pontianak Sultanate|Sultanate of Pontianak]] and was founded on 23 October 1771 around an old trading station on the western coast of Borneo. It was built on swampy ground and tropical forest subjected to regular flooding by the river, requiring buildings to be constructed on piles to keep them off the ground. The name Pontianak refers to a story about ghosts that people in West Kalimantan refer to as [[Pontianak (folklore)|''Pontianak'']] (a ferocious female ghost in [[Malay language|Malay]]); it was a ghosts' haunt until Syarif Abdurrahman Alkadrie and his army fought and expelled the ghosts who attacked them by firing cannons. He then built a mosque and a palace, exactly on the location of the ghosts' haunt, and settled there. The mosque and palace became the first buildings in the city, and to this day locals fire [[bamboo cannon]]s on [[Ramadan]] and other holidays in memory of this.<ref>[http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/bm/newsfeatures.php?id=361412 Amrizan Madian; ''Matahari Tegak Dua Kali Setahun di Kota Khatulistiwa''; Situs Berita Nasional Malaysia] (''in Indonesian'')</ref> 

Pontianak in the [[Chinese language]] is known as {{linktext|坤甸}}, (([[pinyin]]): ''Kūndiàn'') in the local [[Hakka Chinese]], Pontianak is known as '''Khuntîen'''.{{cn|date=August 2024}}

In [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] mythology, the Pontianak is also the name of an astral creature that is said be a spirit of a woman who died while pregnant. Similar stories about the Pontianak first emerged from mythical and folkloric tales that are popular in Kalimantan (Borneo) before the city was built on a large scale of natural habitat. This was an active ancient civilization in the late 17th century.

==History==
{{unreferencedsect|date=May 2022}}
===Early development===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Vrachtboten langs de kade van een kanaal in Pontianak TMnr 60014568.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Boats along the quay of a canal in Pontianak, circa 1920]]
The history of the city of Pontianak written by a Dutch historian, V.J. Verth in his book ''Borneos Afdeling Wester'', whose content is slightly different from the version of the stories circulating in the community today.

According to him, the Dutch started to go to Pontianak in 1773 from [[Jakarta|Batavia]]. Verth wrote that Syarif Abdurrahman, son of Sharif Hussein bin Ahmed cleric Alqadrie (or in another version called Al Habib Husin), left the Kingdom of Mempawah and began to wander. In the region of Banjarmasin, he married the sister of the sultan of Banjar, Sunan Nata Nature and was sworn in as prince. He was successful in commerce and accumulated enough capital to arm ships and boats and then started to take the fight against Dutch colonialism.<ref name=":0">[http://pemkot.pontianak.go.id/sejarah.html ''Sejarah Berdirinya Kota Pontianak''; Situs Pemerintah Kota Pontianak] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331051202/http://pemkot.pontianak.go.id/sejarah.html |date=31 March 2009 }} (in Indonesian)</ref>

With the help of Sultan Sand, Syarif Abdurrahman then successfully hijacked Dutch ship near Bangka, also British and French ships in the port of Pasir. Abdurrahman became a rich man and then tried to establish a settlement on an island in the Kapuas River. He found branching Landak River and then to develop the area into a prosperous trading center. This is the region that is now called Pontianak. He then established the [[Sultanate of Pontianak]] with himself as the first sultan. The influential Arab-Malay writer, [[Abdullah al-Misri]], was closely connected to the rulers of Pontianak at around this time.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Tagliacozzo |first=Eric |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S3nlvRJyjUEC |title=Southeast Asia and the Middle East: Islam, Movement, and the Longue Durée |date=2009 |publisher=NUS Press |isbn=978-9971-69-424-1 |language=en}}</ref>

The sultanate imported Chinese laborers in the 18th century to work in [[gold]] or [[tin]] [[Mining|mines]]. A number of mining companies (''[[kongsi]]'') enjoyed some political autonomy. As the Dutch were expanding its power on Borneo, in 1777, the Chinese declared the formation of the [[Lanfang Republic]] ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 蘭芳共和國), led by Luo Fangbo to oppose the Dutch attempt to colonize West Kalimantan, including Pontianak. The settlers subsequently elected Luo as their inaugural president. Luo implemented many democratic principles, including the idea that all matters of state must involve the consultation of the republic's citizenry. He also created a comprehensive set of executive, legislative, and judicial agencies. The Republic did not have a standing military, but had a defense ministry that administered a national militia based on [[conscription]]. During peacetime, the populace mostly engaged in farming, production, trading, and mining. Lanfang's administrative divisions included three tiers (province, prefecture, and county) with the people electing leaders for all levels. Lanfang was allied with Sultan Abdurrahman of the [[Pontianak Sultanate]]. Lanfang was also declared a tributary state of the Chinese [[Qing Empire]].

===Colonial rule===

[[File:Coat of Arms of Pontianak (Year?).svg|thumb|Tropenmuseum's Coat of Arms of Pontianak designed as the request from Sultan Hamid of Pontianak]]
In 1778, Dutch colonialists from Batavia entered Pontianak, led by Willem Ardinpola. The Netherlands occupied an area opposite the imperial palace now known as the Tanah Seribu or the Verkendepaal area.<ref name=":0" />

On 5 July 1779, the Dutch made an agreement with the Sultanate of Pontianak regarding the Verkendepaal so that it would serve as the area of activities of the Dutch nation which later became the seat of government of Resident het Hoofd Westeraffieling van Borneo (Regional Head residency of Borneo West) and Assistant Resident het Hoofd der Affleeling van Pontianak (Resident assistant Chief of Pontianak regency). This area then became Controleur Onderafdeeling van het Hoofd Hoofd Pontianak or Plaatselijk Bestuur van Pontianak.<ref name=":0" /> Assistant Resident het Hoofd van der Afdeeling Pontianak (Pontianak Regent sort of) set Plaatselijk Fonds. The agency manages government wealth and took care of tax funds.

The Dutch first recognized the independence of the [[Lanfang Republic]]. However, the Dutch decided to expand its territory in Borneo, This was resisted by the officials of Lanfang. In the mid-to-late 19th century, the Chinese [[Qing Empire]] weakened substantially and became increasingly unable to support the Lanfang Republic as its vassal state. The republic's citizenry waged a tenacious resistance, but ultimately failed due to poor weaponry. Lin Ah Sin was the last leader of Lanfang. Many of Lanfang's citizens and their descendants made their way to [[Sumatra]] or [[Singapore]]. The three campaigns waged by the [[Dutch East Indies Army]] against the Chinese ''kongsi'', called the Kongsi Wars, were:
* [[Expedition to the West Coast of Borneo]] (1822–1824)
* [[Expedition against the Chinese in Montrado]] (1850–1854)
* [[Chinese uprising in Mandor, Borneo]] (1884–1885)
Due to being outnumbered and also with the lack of effective weaponry by the more superior and equipped [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]], Lanfang finally surrendered to the Dutch in 1884 and was dissolved. Wary of Qing intervention, the Dutch did not openly annex the Lanfang Republic, and created another puppet regime. It was not until 1912, when the Qing Dynasty collapsed, that the Dutch proclaimed their occupation. Pontianak was then designated as the Residentie Westerafdeeling van Borneo, one of the different residencies of the Dutch East Indies.{{cn|date=May 2022}}

In 1942, the Japanese occupied Pontianak and expelled the Dutch. The Japanese military government decided to allow the Pontianak Sultanate to remain.{{cn|date=May 2022}} However, the Japanese soon become distrusted to the Sultanate, and between 1943 and 1944, the Japanese orchestrated a mass arrest of [[Malay Indonesian|Malay]] elites, [[Arab Indonesians|Arabs]], [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Manado|Menadonese]], [[Dayak people|Dayaks]], [[Bugis people|Bugis]], [[Batak people|Bataks]], [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], Dutch, [[Indian Indonesians|Indians]], and [[Indo people|Eurasians]] in Kalimantan, including all of the Malay Sultans, accused them of plotting to overthrow Japanese rule, and then massacred them. This is known as the [[Pontianak massacre]].

After the [[surrender of Japan]], a Dutch military court in Pontianak on 18 October 1947 convicted the Japanese Admiral [[Michiaki Kamada]] of [[war crimes]] and sentenced him to death.

=== Independence ===
[[File:Keraton Kadariah 01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Kadariah'' Palace]]

After the Japanese surrendered, the Dutch returned to Pontianak. Due to international opposition to Dutch attempts to reinstate control over Indonesia in the United Nations, the Dutch were forced to recognise Sukarno's Republic as the de facto government of Java and Sumatra and to grant independence to a [[Republic of the United States of Indonesia]] (RUSI) on 27 December 1949. Pontianak became the capital of the State of West Kalimantan, one of the federal states of the [[Republic of the United States of Indonesia|United States of Indonesia]]. It was led by [[Sultan Hamid II]], the last sultan of the Pontianak Sultanate. However, Hamid II was accused of conspiring with the former KNIL Captain [[Raymond Westerling]] to organise an [[APRA Coup d'état|anti-Republican coup]] in [[Bandung]] and [[Jakarta]]. Hamid's role in the coup led to increased agitation in West Kalimantan for its integration into the Republic of Indonesia.

Following a fact-finding mission by the Government Commission, the RUSI House of Representatives voted by 50 votes to one to merge West Kalimantan into the Republic of Indonesia. Following clashes with demobilised KNIL troops in [[Makassar]] and the attempted secession of an [[Ambonese]] [[Republic of South Moluccas]], the federal United States of Indonesia was dissolved on 17 August 1950, turning Indonesia into a unitary state dominated by the central government in Jakarta. Pontianak then became the capital city of the new province of West Kalimantan.

==Geography==
{{unreferencedsect|date=May 2022}}
[[File:Pelabuhan Tua.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ''Seng Hie'' port, oldest port in Pontianak, lies along the banks of Kapuas river.]]
[[File:Taman kota.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Pontianak Town park]]
Pontianak lies on the [[equator]] at a height ranging from 0.1 to 1.5 meters above sea level. It is divided into three parts by the [[Kapuas River|Kapuas Besar]] and its major tributaries – the Kapuas Kecil and Landak rivers. The city lies on flat land in the delta of the Kapuas River with a ground level elevation ranging from 0.1 to 1.9 meters above sea level.

The city is built on fall peneplain and alluvial sediments that are physically a clay type. This type of soil is in the form of peat and silt deposits of Kapuas river. Under these conditions, the soil is very unstable and has a very low carrying capacity. The soil composition along the river is formed from a precipitation process that produces a tropaquent area coupled with tropofluevent and under permanently saturated fluvawuent conditions. It is derived from the new sapphire sediment from various compositions and shapes, including organic matter.

Pontianak consists of a kind of soil organosol, gray, humus, and alluvial with different characteristics. At some points, the thickness of the peat soils reaches up to 1–6 meters, thus causing a poor carrying capacity if it is designated to construct large buildings to make it as a farm.

===Time zone===
In 1963 by Presidential Decree No. 243, the city entered into the [[Central Indonesian Time]] (WITA) zone (GMT+8).

On 1 January 1988 by Presidential Decree No. 41, West Kalimantan (together with [[Central Kalimantan]]) moved back 1 hour from the Central Indonesian Time (WITA) zone, to the [[Western Indonesian Time]] (WIB) zone. As such, in 1988 the city of Pontianak celebrated the New Year twice: at 00:00 on GMT+8 and then 00:00 on GMT+7.

===Climate===
Pontianak features a [[tropical rainforest climate]] under the [[Köppen climate classification]] (Af) with no distinct seasons at all and with heavy to very heavy rainfall year-round. The city experiences a large amount of rainfall throughout the year, averaging {{convert|2896|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually. Only in the month of July and August does the average monthly precipitation fall below {{convert|150|mm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}}. Temperatures are consistent throughout the course of the year, with average high temperatures of {{convert|31|°C}} and average low temperatures of {{convert|23|°C}}.

[[File:Gawai Dayak Pontianak.jpg|thumb|right|270px|[[Gawai Dayak]] Festival in Pontianak]]
Compared to other Indonesian cities, Pontianak is one of the few cities with a significant number of [[Chinese Indonesians]]. The Chinese have lived in Pontianak for centuries. Most of the Chinese were passing through west Borneo from the third century for a last rest on their sailing journeys before returning to China. Beginning in the 7th century many Chinese had started to trade in western Borneo. Apart from the Chinese traders, in the 17th century Dutch colonization brought in mass Chinese for mining gold. Most of these Chinese miners originated from the [[Fujian]] or [[Guangdong]] provinces.

The two largest sub-groups of the Pontianak Chinese are the [[Teochew people|Teochew]] and [[Hakka people|Hakka]]. The Teochew people are from the northeastern coast of Guangdong and Hakka people from the interior of Fujian come to West Kalimantan. The Hakka people are pioneer groups living in villages and mining areas, working as miners, farmers, and also small traders. This is in contrast to the Teochew people who prefer to live in urban areas for trade. Even now the Teochew people form the largest ethnic Chinese population in the city of Pontianak and south of Pontianak. The Hakka people mostly live in the northern area of Pontianak.

The second largest ethnic group in Pontianak is the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay people.]] The Pontianak Malay are one of the early inhabitants of the city. Pontianak was the seat of the Pontianak Sultanate, a great Malay kingdom for centuries. The Malay people mostly live on the bank of the Kapuas River and other rivers in Pontianak. They also live in coastal areas of the city. Most of the Pontianak Malay work as traders, government officials, and in other jobs.

Other significant ethnic groups living in Pontianak are the Dayak, Bugis, Madurese, and Javanese. Most of the Dayak living in Pontianak are the indigenous/native people of the interior part of West Kalimantan. Some of the Dayak still practice [[animism]], which involves traditional rituals and dances. However, most of the Dayaks have converted to Christianity and are more urbanized. The Bugis, Javanese, and Madurese are immigrants from other parts of Indonesia. They migrated to Pontianak due to the [[Transmigration program]] enacted by the Dutch and continued during the New Order. Conflicts often erupted between the Madurese and the Dayak.

===Language===
[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] is the official language of Pontianak as well as other parts of Indonesia. The native language and main [[lingua franca]] of the city is [[Pontianak Malay]], a distinct variety of Malay that is closely related to [[Malay language|Johor-Riau Malay]] in [[Malaysia]], [[Riau]], and the [[Riau Islands]] in Indonesia and [[Singapore]]. The main differences between Pontianak Malay and Indonesian is that they use "Kamek" instead of "Kami" and "Kitak" instead of "Kalian", which is more similar to [[Sarawak Malay]], given their proximity. However, many people in the city also use [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] as their second language.

The other prevailing language in Pontianak is the [[Chinese language]]. Several [[varieties of Chinese]] exists in Pontianak, the most notable being [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] and [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]]. Teochew is a variant of [[Southern Min]] originating from Guangdong. It is mostly mutually intelligible with [[Hokkien]]. Teochew is mostly spoken in the central and southern parts of the city, as well as suburbs south of the city. Hakka is spoken in the northern part of the city, as well as in suburbs north of the city. There are more Teochew speakers than Hakka speakers in Pontianak. These varieties of Chinese has been influenced by other languages such as Malay, Indonesian, and other languages. They have incorporated words from Indonesian and other languages. Therefore, native speakers from China may find it difficult to communicate using Teochew and Hakka with the people from Pontianak. Other Chinese variants such as the [[Cantonese]] and Hokkien have fewer speakers.

Other languages such as the [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Madurese language|Madurese]], [[Buginese language|Buginese]], and different dialects of Dayak are also spoken.

=== Religion ===
The majority of the population are Muslims (63.4%); the rest are Buddhists (23.2%), Catholics (9.1%), Protestants (3.2%), Confucians (1.3%), Hindus (0.1%), and others (0.1%).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sp2010.bps.go.id/index.php/site/tabel?tid=321&wid=6100000000|title=Peringatan|website=sp2010.bps.go.id|access-date=2018-02-15}}</ref> Most of the Muslims are Malay, Javanese, Madurese, etc. While most of the people who adhere to Buddhism and Confucianism are [[Chinese Indonesian]], many Chinese also adhere to Christianity. The Dayak people adhere to either Catholicism or Protestantism, while also incorporating local beliefs. Some of the Dayak also adheres to [[Kaharingan]], a local folk religion. However, the Indonesian government does not recognize Kaharingan as a religion and therefore classifies those who adhere to Kaharingan beliefs as Hindus.

Several places of worship are located in Pontianak, such as the [[Jami Mosque of Pontianak]], which is considered the great mosque of Pontianak. Located in the complex of the palace of the former Pontianak Sultanate, this mosque is the oldest mosque and is one of the two buildings that witnessed the establishment of the city of Pontianak. At first, this mosque was also used as a center of government for the Sultanate of Pontianak. The name of this mosque was given by Syarif Usman Alkadri who is the son of Sultan Sharif Abdurrahman, who continued the construction of the mosque until it was completed.

Other places of worship are the [[St. Joseph's Cathedral, Pontianak|Cathedral of Saint Joseph]], Pura Giripati Mulawarman, Vihara Budhisatva Karaniya Metta, and the Pontianak Congregation of [[West Kalimantan Christian Church]]. Some of these have existed since the Dutch colonial era, while some are constructed by the Indonesian government.

[[Supadio International Airport]] is the main airport for Pontianak and West Kalimantan, built by the Japanese during [[World War II]]. The Indonesian government then developed the airport, resulting in its present form. The airport is not located within the city limits, but in [[Kubu Raya Regency]] which is 17&nbsp;km away from the city center. Currently it is the second-largest airport in Kalimantan in terms of terminal size, after [[Sultan Aji Muhammad Sulaiman Airport]] in [[Balikpapan]].

After construction of a new modern terminal to replace the old and overutilised terminal, the airport currently has a capacity of 3.8 million passengers annually, double the previous terminal's capacity. The airport serves direct domestic flights to other major cities in Indonesia, mostly in Java and Kalimantan. Moreover, the airport also has international flights to some cities in Malaysia, such as Kuala Lumpur and Kuching. The airport is expected to be expanded again in the future to cater to the increasing number of passengers travelling to and from Pontianak. Currently, the only ways to get to the airport are by taxi, private cars, or using [[Perum DAMRI|DAMRI]] buses.

=== Sea ===
The Port of Pontianak, located on the banks of the Kapuas River, is the economic pulse of the city and connects an area of 146.8 thousand km2 in West Kalimantan Province. The size of this area is comparable to the island of Java plus the island of Madura combined. Main cities and towns served include Pontianak, Sintete, Sambas, Sintang, Sanggau, Kapuas, Hulu, Telok Air, Ketapang, and Singkawang.

There are two port areas under the auspices of PT. Pelindo II (Persero), namely the Port of Sintete and Ketapang Port.

This port's hinterland is dominated by plantations, the forestry sector, the mining sector, and raw materials processing industry. To cater for increased economic activity in this region, Pelindo II has operated the container terminal for Pontianak's port. It has been equipped with two container cranes and various modern equipment that can provide optimal support for loading and unloading activities in the region.

The Pontianak Crossing Port is the main passenger port. It allows ferry connection to other cities in Indonesia such as Jakarta, Surabaya, Medan, Batam, etc. The port currently does not serve international destinations such as Singapore and Malaysia.
