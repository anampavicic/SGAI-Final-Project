'''Barrie''' is a city in [[Central Ontario]], Canada, about {{convert|90|km|mi|0}} north of [[Toronto]]. The city is within [[Simcoe County]] and located along the shores of [[Kempenfelt Bay]]. Although it is physically in the county, Barrie is politically independent. The city is part of the extended urban area in southern Ontario known as the [[Golden Horseshoe|Greater Golden Horseshoe]]. As of the [[2021 Census of Population|2021 census]], the city's population was 147,829, while the [[Census metropolitan areas|census metropolitan area]] had a population of 212,667 residents.

The area was first settled during the [[War of 1812]] as a supply depot for British forces, and Barrie was named after Sir [[Robert Barrie]]. The city has grown significantly in recent decades due to the emergence of the technology industry. It is connected to the Greater Golden Horseshoe by [[Ontario Highway 400]] and [[GO Transit]]. Significant sectors of the city's diversified economy include education, healthcare, information technology and manufacturing.

== History ==

=== Before 1900 ===
Barrie is situated on the traditional land of the [[Wyandot people|Wendat]] and [[Anishinaabe]]g peoples.<ref name=":1">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Barrie |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |date=December 16, 2020 |last=Moreau |first=Nick |publisher=[[Historica Canada]] |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/barrie |access-date=June 5, 2021}}</ref> At its inception, Barrie was an establishment of houses and warehouses at the foot of the [[Nine Mile Portage]] from [[Kempenfelt Bay]] to [[Fort Willow]], an indigenous transportation route that existed centuries before Europeans arrived in [[Simcoe County]].<ref name=":1"/> The portage linked Kempenfelt Bay through Willow Creek, connecting [[Lake Simcoe]] to the [[Nottawasaga River]] which flows into [[Georgian Bay]] off [[Lake Huron]].

Barrie played an integral role in the [[War of 1812]]. During the war, the city became a [[supply depot]] for British forces and, in addition, the Nine Mile Portage was adopted by the British military as a key piece of their supply line which provided a strategic path for communication, personnel and vital supplies and equipment to and from Fort Willow and Georgian Bay/Lake Huron. Today, the Nine Mile Portage is marked by signs along roads in Barrie and in [[Springwater, Ontario|Springwater Township]]. The scenic path from Memorial Square to Fort Willow is accessible to visitors year-round.

In 1815, [[Lake Simcoe–Lake Huron Purchase|Treaty 16]] was signed, which transferred 250,000 acres of land from the [[Chippewa]] people to the colonial government.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web |publisher=[[CIRNAC]] |date=March 7, 2016 |title=Treaty Texts – Upper Canada Land Surrenders: Lake Simcoe Treaty No. 16 |url=https://www.rcaanc-cirnac.gc.ca/eng/1370372152585/1581293792285#ucls15 |access-date=June 5, 2021}}</ref> In 1818, Treaty 18 was signed, which resulted in the surrender of an additional 1,592,000 acres of land.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web |publisher=[[CIRNAC]] |date=March 7, 2016 |title=Treaty Texts – Upper Canada Land Surrenders: Lake Simcoe-Nottawasaga Treaty No. 18 |url=https://www.rcaanc-cirnac.gc.ca/eng/1370372152585/1581293792285#ucls16 |access-date=June 5, 2021}}</ref> The British supply depot would continue to prove useful for portaging Europeans and settlers making their way to northern and western [[Upper Canada]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.muskokaregion.com/news-story/3596892-volunteers-help-preserve-barrie-s-war-of-1812-heritage/ | title=Volunteers help preserve Barrie's War of 1812 heritage | date=September 12, 2004 }}</ref>

The city was named in 1833 after [[Robert Barrie|Sir Robert Barrie]], who was in charge of the naval forces in Canada and frequently commanded forces through the city and along the Nine Mile Portage. Barrie was also the final destination for a branch of the [[Underground Railroad]]. In the mid-19th century, this network of secret routes allowed many American slaves to enter Barrie and the surrounding area. This contributed to the development (and name) of nearby [[Shanty Bay, Ontario|Shanty Bay]]. In 1846, the population of Barrie was roughly 500, mostly from England, Ireland and Scotland. A private school, three churches, a brick courthouse and a limestone jail, (built in 1842), were in operation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Simcoe County Court-House and Gaol |url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Simcoe25.html |publisher=Ontario's Historical Plaques |access-date=14 November 2018}}</ref> Local businesses included three [[tavern]]s, six stores, three [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]], a wagon maker, a bakery, a cabinet maker and six shoemakers, as well as a bank.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

ROWSELL |page=[https://archive.org/details/smithscanadianga00smit/page/9 9]}}</ref>

By 1869, Barrie became the county seat of Simcoe County, flourishing with a population of over 3,000 people. With this population increase came the establishment of prominent businesses and landmarks. In 1850, Edward Marks had established the Barrie Hotel (now called the Queen's Hotel), the oldest continuously running hotel in Barrie, James and Joseph Anderton established the Anderton Brewery in 1869, which would go on to be one of Barrie's largest employers for years, and Edmund Lally opened one of the Canadian Bank of Commerce's original branches in Barrie in 1867.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Heritage Barrie Walking Tour Directory|url=https://www.barrie.ca/Culture/Heritage/Documents/Walking-Tours/Downtown-East-Walking-Tour.pdf|website=Barrie.ca|access-date=June 20, 2022|archive-date=October 7, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221007050052/https://www.barrie.ca/Culture/Heritage/Documents/Walking-Tours/Downtown-East-Walking-Tour.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Sneath |first=Allen |title=Brewed in Canada: The Untold Story of Canada's 300-Year-Old Brewing Industry |publisher=Dundern Press |year=2001 |pages=350}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=THEN AND NOW: By all accounts, Barrie's banking history dates back to early 1800s |url=https://www.barrietoday.com/then-and-now/then-and-now-by-all-accounts-barries-banking-history-dates-back-to-early-1800s-5291346 |access-date=2022-06-20 |website=BarrieToday.com |date=April 24, 2022 }}</ref> A line of the [[Northern Railway of Canada|Northern Railway]] was opened in 1853, connecting Barrie with Toronto and several other municipalities in Simcoe County and [[District Municipality of Muskoka|Muskoka]]. The [[Hamilton and North-Western Railway]] (H&NW) also ran through Barrie, and the two railways would eventually reorganize into the Northern and North Western Railway in June 1879. [[Allandale Waterfront GO Station|Allandale Station]] was the primary train station serving Barrie at the time. The [[Grand Trunk Railway]] purchased the original Northern Railway in 1888, and the line serving Barrie would become a branch of the [[Canadian National Railway]] (CNR). Throughout the latter of the 19th century, [[steamship]]s ran from Barrie to the [[District Municipality of Muskoka|Muskoka Territory]], [[Orillia, Ontario|Orillia]] and other communities and stages were taking passengers to [[Penetanguishene]].<ref>''The Province of Ontario Gazetteer and Directory''. H. McEvoy Editor and Compiler, Toronto : Robertson & Cook, Publishers, 1869</ref>

The period of 1870 to 1890 defined Barrie's downtown development with a series of raging fires that sequentially destroyed multiple landmarks, giving rise to the moniker that Barrie was "among the best burning towns in Canada."<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.simcoe.com/news-story/2069137-huge-fires-defined-barrie-s-downtown-development/|title=Huge fires defined Barrie's downtown development|date=2007-12-07|website=Simcoe.com-CA|access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref> Many local businesses like breweries, tanneries and sawmills depended on fire to operate, endangering the ramshackle assortment of wooden homes and buildings that made up the city centre.

One of the most destructive fires came in mid-1875 when the entire section north of Dunlop Street to Collier Street, bounded by Clapperton and Owen Streets, was reduced to ash, destroying around 20 local businesses.

=== 20th century ===
In the next century, the modern streets and buildings of Barrie began to take form in a massive rebuilding process. Other landmarks to eventually burn down over the years include the Queen's Hotel (1915) and two of Barrie's largest and most prominent companies; the Sevigny Carriage Shop and the Anderton Brewery in 1916.<ref name=":0" />

During the [[World War I|First World War]], residents of Barrie helped to construct [[Canadian Forces Base Borden]] (CFB Borden) as a means of additional support and to serve as a major training centre of [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] battalions. The base would open on July 11, 1916, and since then has become the largest Canadian Forces Base in Canada, playing an important role through the remainder of the war by training some 350,000 troops for deployment in Europe. During World War II, the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] named a {{sclass2|Flower|corvette}} {{HMCS|Barrie}}.

On September 7, 1977, a private aircraft, owned by Falconbridge Nickel Mines Ltd, dropped altitude to {{convert|500|ft|m|0}} in dense fog and struck CKVR's {{convert|1,000|ft|m|adj=on|0}} transmitter tower, killing all five people aboard the plane and destroying the tower and antenna. The station's {{convert|225|ft|m|adj=on|0}} auxiliary tower was also destroyed with damage to the main studio building. CKVR returned to the air on September 19 at a reduced power of 40,000 watts until a new {{convert|1,000|ft|m|adj=on|0}} tower was built in 1978.

The 1980s and 1990s was a period of substantial growth for Barrie, with the population tripling in the span of 25 years. In 1981, the city had a population of 38,423; in 2006, Barrie had 128,430 residents living within city limits. The first larger scale developments would begin during this time, including high-density waterfront condos and the new Barrie City Hall which started construction in October 1985.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

On May 31, 1985, Barrie was struck by a [[1985 Barrie tornado|devastating F4 tornado]] that killed eight people. Over 600 homes were damaged or destroyed by the tornado, and of those roughly one-third were rendered uninhabitable. About 155 people were also injured during the storm, and the tornado remains today one of the most destructive and violent in Canadian history. The tornado caused $150 million (1985 [[Canadian dollar|CAD]]), equivalent to $326 million CAD as of 2022.

Between June 12–13, 1987, a sculpture called ''[[Spirit Catcher]]'' by [[Ron Baird]] was moved to Barrie from [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], where it had been exhibited as part of [[Expo '86]]. The sculpture was permanently erected at the foot of Maple Avenue on the shore of Kempenfelt Bay and has since become a major Barrie landmark and tourist attraction. However, with the re-development along the waterfront and Lakeshore Drive, the city is considering moving the Spirit Catcher to a gravel outcropping at the foot of Bayfield Street.

On January 12, 2004, the former [[Molson Brewery|Molsons plant]] was found to be home to an illegal marijuana grow-op housing an estimated 30,000 marijuana plants with an estimated street value of $30 million (~${{Format price|{{Inflation|index=US-GDP|value=30000000|start_year=2004}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US-GDP}}); at the time, it was the largest marijuana grow-op bust in Canada's history.

Barrie's [[Park Place (Ontario)|Park Place]] (formerly Molson Park) was chosen to host [[live8|Live 8]] Canada on July 2, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1119352066774_150 |title=Barrie, Ont. to host Canadian edition of Live 8 |access-date=September 14, 2006 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051226043121/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1119352066774_150 |archive-date=December 26, 2005 }}</ref> The overall success of the concert helped support a plan to convert the former [[Molson Park]] lands into a commercial district. Construction of Park Place began in 2008 but was temporarily interrupted by the [[Great Recession]] and an [[Ontario Municipal Board]] (OMB) appeal that proposed a rezoning of the Park Place lands that was initially denied by the City of Barrie. Construction resumed in 2010.

An explosion in the Royal Thai restaurant, housed in the landmark Wellington Hotel at the "Five Points" intersection in downtown Barrie, occurred at 11:20pm on December 6, 2007. The fire quickly spread to several neighbouring buildings and firefighters battled the blaze well into the following morning, requiring assistance from other Simcoe County fire services. Officials estimated the damages to be in the millions. The 100-year-old Wellington Hotel building collapsed later in the morning.<ref name="canada.com">{{cite web   |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=4f3ddae9-5044-4f4d-a4fb-7adee1d63299&k=71332 |title=Massive blaze destroys six buildings in Barrie |date=December 7, 2007 |access-date=December 7, 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071209023032/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=4f3ddae9-5044-4f4d-a4fb-7adee1d63299&k=71332| archive-date= December 9, 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref><ref name="ctv.ca">{{cite web |title=Fire destroys historic buildings in Barrie, Ont. |url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20071207/barrie_fire_071207/20071207?hub=TorontoHome |date=December 7, 2007 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071210055740/http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20071207/barrie_fire_071207/20071207?hub=TorontoHome| archive-date= December 10, 2007 |url-status = dead}}</ref> On February 17, 2008, two people were charged in connection with the fire after the Ontario Fire Marshal's office concluded the explosion and subsequent fire were the result of arson.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pair charged in Barrie fire had ties to destroyed restaurant |url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2008/02/18/pf-4856783.html|publisher=Canoe.ca CNEWS|access-date=February 4, 2011|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709132558/http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2008/02/18/pf-4856783.html|archive-date=July 9, 2012|url-status = usurped}}</ref>

== Geography ==
Barrie is located in the central portion of southern Ontario, approximately {{convert|abbr=on|90|km}} north of [[Toronto]] within the Greater [[Golden Horseshoe]] subregion. It is accessible via Highways [[Ontario Highway 26|26]], [[Ontario Highway 400|400]] and [[Ontario Highway 11|11]] and has convenient access to [[Highway 401]], the [[Highway 407|Highway 407 Express Toll Route]] and to neighbouring Toronto. [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]] is less than a one-hour drive from Barrie via Highway 400.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

Barrie's historic downtown area is situated in a distinct curved or wrapped valley, surrounding the western edge of Kempenfelt Bay. Terrain is generally flat near the city's centre. Moving up the valley slopes toward the city's north and south ends, the terrain can be rather steep in some areas. The minimum elevation of Barrie is {{convert|175|m|ft|0}} around the shores of Kempenfelt Bay and the maximum elevation is {{convert|427|m|ft|0}} northwest of the [[Lake Simcoe Regional Airport]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://en-ca.topographic-map.com/maps/qp2/Barrie/ | title=Barrie topographic map, elevation, relief|website=En-ca.topographic-map.com }}</ref>

Barrie falls into Plant Hardiness Zone 5b. The city does not have any major rivers within its limits but does have numerous creeks and streams, most of which empty into Kempenfelt Bay.

=== Expansion ===
Barrie has been designated an Urban Growth Centre by the province of Ontario. As one of the fastest growing cities in Canada, this designation aims to mitigate urban sprawl and concentrate higher-density development in areas specified by the City of Barrie. Its population growth can be attributed to the emergence of the city as a bedroom community for Toronto. In 1991, Barrie had a population of 62,728 and by 2017, Barrie had an estimated population of 147,000. By 2031, the city's population is expected to exceed 200,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.barrie.ca/City+Hall/Planning-and-Development/Pages/Growth-Management.aspx|title=Growth Management|website=Barrie.ca|access-date=July 24, 2022}}</ref> To plan for the continued growth of the city, Barrie successfully annexed {{convert|2,293|hectare|km2}} of land from the neighbouring Town of [[Innisfil, Ontario|Innisfil]] to the south and southeast on January 1, 2010.<ref>{{cite web |title=Barrie-Innisfil Boundary Adjustment Act, 2009 |url=http://www.fairgrowth.ca/pdf/Barrie-Innisfil-Adjustment-Act2009.pdf |publisher=the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario |access-date=15 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122070201/http://www.fairgrowth.ca/pdf/Barrie-Innisfil-Adjustment-Act2009.pdf |archive-date=22 November 2010}}</ref> The annexation comprised lands south beyond McKay Road and west of the 10th Sideroad, and as far south as Lockhart Road on the east side of the 10th Sideroad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fairgrowth.ca/images/proposedBoundaryChanges.PNG|format=PNG|title=Photographic image|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214130142/http://www.fairgrowth.ca/images/proposedBoundaryChanges.PNG |access-date=July 24, 2022|archive-date=February 14, 2010 }}</ref> The annexation allows Barrie to meet its future population needs without having to extend into the countryside north, east and west of the city. Intensification and infilling are simultaneously being undertaken in and near the downtown core to foster a more active urban environment within the city.

=== Military ===
Barrie has a long military history dating back to at least the Nine Mile Portage of the War of 1812. By the time of the [[Rebellions of 1837–1838|1837 Rebellion]], Simcoe County had a sufficient population to form a [[battalion]] of [[Militia|Sedentary Militia]] of almost 600 strong. This battalion was involved in marching suspected rebels down Yonge Street to Toronto in order to face justice. By 1855, Barrie was home to an [[Company (military unit)|independent company]] of Rifle Company of militia, followed in 1863 by a company of Infantry. These companies served during the [[Fenian Raids]]. With the Militia Act of 1866, the companies in Barrie were respectively organized as Number 1 and Number 5 companies, in the newly formed 35th Battalion of Infantry (Simcoe Foresters), gazetted on September 14, 1866.

In 1885, four companies from the 35th Simcoe Foresters, including those from Barrie, along with four companies from the 12th York Battalion came together to form the York-Simcoe Battalion. This specially raised battalion served in [[Western Canada]] during the [[North-West Rebellion]], under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel W.E. O'Brien of [[Shanty Bay]], Ontario. For its efforts, The Simcoe Foresters received its first [[Battle Honour]] "North West Canada 1885". Citizens of Barrie would next volunteer for military service during the [[Boer War]] in [[South Africa]] from 1899 to 1902. It was during this conflict that at the [[Battle of Paardeberg]], the citizens of Barrie and The Simcoe Foresters suffered their first fatal casualty, Private James Halkett Findlay. Private Findlay was killed-in-action on February 18, 1900, while serving with C Company of the 2nd Battalion [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] of Infantry.

In 1914, the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out and many citizens of Barrie were quick to volunteer for service overseas with The Simcoe Foresters. Late the following year, the Regiment was tasked with raising two overseas battalions, the [[157th Battalion (Simcoe Foresters), CEF]] and the [[177th Battalion (Simcoe Foresters), CEF]]. In the spring of 1916, the Barrie and [[Collingwood, Ontario|Collingwood]] companies of the 157th Battalion began clearing the land for the construction of a new military camp on the Simcoe Pines Plain&nbsp;— Camp Borden (now [[CFB Borden]]). This began Barrie's long friendship with the Base, hence the reason CFB Borden was used for ''[[Canada's Worst Driver 2]]'' and ''[[Canada's Worst Driver 5]].''

With a re-organization of the Canadian Militia between the two world wars, The Simcoe Foresters, headquartered in Barrie, were amalgamated in 1936 with the Grey Regiment, headquartered at [[Owen Sound]], Ontario. This event created the present-day regiment of [[The Grey and Simcoe Foresters]], which is headquartered at the Armoury in Queen's Park, downtown Barrie. With the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1939, citizens of Barrie volunteered for service overseas with The Grey and Simcoe Foresters, the Royal Canadian Navy and the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]. The City of Barrie sponsored a ship in the Royal Canadian Navy, HMCS ''Barrie'', a Flower-class corvette.

== Transportation ==

=== Airports ===
There are no major airports with scheduled flights near Barrie (the closest being [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]], located in [[Mississauga]]). There are a few airports that are used for light aviation aircraft:

* [[Lake Simcoe Regional Airport]]
* [[Barrie/Little Lake Water Aerodrome]]
* [[Springwater (Barrie Airpark) Aerodrome]]

=== Roads ===
Barrie is served by Provincial [[Ontario Highway 400|Highway&nbsp;400]], which acts as the primary route between Barrie and Toronto. Highway&nbsp;400 bisects the city on a roughly north–south basis. [[Ontario Highway 26|Highway&nbsp;26]], also located in the city, is the main route to the Collingwood area and is known as Bayfield Street within the city limits. Barrie was once served by [[Ontario Highway 27|Highway&nbsp;27]], [[Ontario Highway 90|Highway&nbsp;90]], [[Ontario Highway 93|Highway&nbsp;93]], [[Ontario Highway 131|Highway&nbsp;131]] and [[Ontario Highway 11|Highway&nbsp;11]]. However, the province downgraded many highways in 1997 and 1998; these highways are now known as [[Simcoe County Road&nbsp;27]], [[Simcoe County Road&nbsp;90]] (Dunlop Street), and [[Simcoe County Road&nbsp;93]].

The portion of Highway&nbsp;11 through Barrie is known as [[Yonge Street]], though it is actually part of the [[Penetanguishene Road]]. Major arterial roads within the city include Mapleview Drive, Ferndale Drive, 10th Line, Big Bay Point Road, Essa Road, Huronia Road, Bayfield Street, Cundles Road, Anne Street, Dunlop Street, Livingstone Street, Duckworth Street, Wellington Street and St. Vincent Street.

=== Public transit ===
Public transport is provided by [[Barrie Transit]], which operates numerous bus routes within the city. Accessible transit is offered by booking with city run [[Barrie Accessible Community Transportation Service]]. Most regular bus routes operated by Barrie Transit are accessible using low floor vehicles.
Barrie also has GO Trains and Buses.

=== Commuter rail ===
[[GO Transit]] connects the city to the [[Greater Toronto Area]] through daily train service along the [[Barrie line]], with trains operating from the [[Allandale Waterfront GO Station]] and the [[Barrie South GO Station]]. This is primarily a commuter rail service to the GTA, with southbound trips to Toronto's [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] in the morning rush hour and northbound trips in the evening rush hour. Limited weekend service to and from Toronto is also operated. Barrie was once a [[Northlander#Former stations|stop for the Northlander]] train but re-routing resulted in the termination of service. The former Barrie station serving the Northlander still exists north of the Allandale GO Station.

=== Intercity and commuter buses ===
In addition to train service, [[GO Transit]] offers daily commuter-oriented bus service to the Greater Toronto Area. [[Ontario Northland Motor Coach Services|Ontario Northland]] operates bus routes from various locations to and from Barrie. All inter-urban buses operate from the [[Barrie Transit Terminal]] at 24 Maple Street.

Barrie once had been served by various private interurban bus lines such as [[Penetang-Midland Coach Lines]] and [[Greyhound Canada]], which ran buses between Barrie and Toronto's [[Yorkdale Bus Terminal]]. Greyhound operated QuickLink commuter service from Barrie to Toronto seven days a week. In the past [[Gray Coach]] offered service from Toronto to Barrie; the route was later acquired by Greyhound. Greyhound Canada ended all service in Ontario on May 13, 2021.<ref name="Greyhound">{{cite web| url=https://news.greyhound.ca/| title=Greyhound Canada Closes its Services in Canada| date=May 13, 2021| archive-date=May 13, 2021| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210513171749/https://news.greyhound.ca/| url-status=live}}</ref>

Barrie is also served by [[Simcoe County LINX]], which provides services between municipalities within Simcoe County, including Orillia, Midland and Penetanguishine.<ref name=routes>{{cite web |url=https://www.simcoe.ca/Transit/Pages/Routes-Schedule.aspx |title=Routes/Schedule – Transit |website=Simcoe.ca |access-date=November 17, 2020}}</ref>

=== Passenger rail ===
Historically, Barrie was served by scheduled passenger rail service. Allandale Station was a stop for the [[Grand Trunk Railway]], [[Canadian National Railway]] and [[Via Rail]]. In addition, [[Ontario Northland]]'s [[Northlander]] used the station as a stop, as did [[CN Rail]]/Via Rail (namely [[The Canadian]]). Regular passenger rail service to the station ended in the 1980s and has largely been replaced by regional/commuter rail service.

== Education ==
Barrie has two major English school boards that operate inside the city at a public level. The [[Simcoe County District School Board]] administers a public education in Barrie and Simcoe County, while the [[Simcoe Muskoka Catholic District School Board]] administers to the Catholic population and serves the Simcoe and Muskoka areas. It also has two French school boards, [[Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir]] (formerly Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud), the Catholic board, and [[Conseil scolaire Viamonde]] (CSV, formerly Conseil Scolaire de District du Centre-Sud-Ouest), the secular board. There are also several private schools both for K-8 and K-12.

There are both semi-weekly and monthly newspapers serving the City of Barrie. The ''[[Barrie Advance]]'', published by [[Metroland Media Group]], is a free newspaper established in 1983 and delivered weekly (on Thursdays) to every residence in the city as well as residents of Springwater Township and parts of Oro-Medonte. The newspaper contains local news, classifieds, advertisements and flyers. ''Barrie Business'' is a free newsprint publication covering local and regional business news. Published monthly and distributed to every business in the City of Barrie through Canada Post, it seeks to highlight and support Barrie's local business community and events. The ''[[Barrie Examiner]]'', established in 1864, was one of Canada's oldest daily newspapers. It was distributed five days a week (Tuesday to Saturday) to paid subscribers and also delivered to the remainder of the market free on Thursdays. The ''Examiner'' was one of several [[Postmedia Network]] newspapers purchased by [[Torstar]] in a transaction between the two companies in 2017.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kopun|first1=Francine|title=Torstar, Postmedia announce community and daily paper deal|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2017/11/27/torstar-postmedia-announce-community-and-daily-paper-deal.html|access-date=November 27, 2017|work=Toronto Star|date=November 27, 2017}}</ref> Following the acquisition, Torstar subsidiary [[Metroland Media Group]] announced the closure of the paper effective November 27, 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title=Postmedia and Torstar swap dozens of community papers, but will shut down most of them|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/postmedia-torstar-1.4420955|access-date=November 27, 2017|work=CBC News|agency=The Canadian Press|date=November 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Metroland Media to publish 4 daily papers purchased from Postmedia|url=https://metroland.com/press-releases/metroland-media-to-publish-4-daily-papers-purchased-from-postmedia/|website=Metroland Media Group|publisher=Torstar Corporation|access-date=November 27, 2017|date=November 27, 2017|quote=The closure of the newspapers, which is effective immediately, will affect 46 full-time and part-time employees|archive-date=November 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171128093231/https://metroland.com/press-releases/metroland-media-to-publish-4-daily-papers-purchased-from-postmedia/|url-status=dead}}</ref>
