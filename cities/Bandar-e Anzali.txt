== History ==
Anzali is an old city in ancient Iran, first settled by the [[Cadusii]]. Owing to their pleasant relationship with [[Cyrus the Great]], King of [[Anshan (Persia)]], and their military cooperation in Cyrus's founding of the [[Achaemenian Empire]], the Cadusii adopted the name ''Anshan-e Pars'' (''Ανσνάν'' in Greek), meaning "the Anshans of Persia".{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

This word in [[Middle Persian]] is ''Anzalag''; a variant Persian form is ''Anzalazh''.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}} Anzali Gulf was a safe harbour for trade ships and fishing boats. It was renamed to ''Pahlavi'' in 1935.

In 1919, with the collapse of General [[Anton Denikin]]'s [[White Army|White Russian army]], eighteen of his ships sought refuge in Anzali. On 18 May 1920, a Soviet flotilla of thirteen ships launched a surprise attack on Anzali, capturing the British garrison and the eighteen White Russian ships. This allowed for the establishment of the short-lived [[Persian Socialist Republic]] and the Persian Communist Party. Soviet authorities denied responsibility for the attack, blaming the local Russian naval commander for attacking under his own authority.<ref>''[[A Peace to End All Peace]]'', [[David Fromkin]], 1989, pp.458-459.</ref>

The city was home to the first and biggest port on the southern shores of the [[Caspian Sea]]. Bandar-e Anzali consists of an island called ''Mianposhteh'' and the surrounding lands. Tourist attractions include a clock tower called ''Manareh'', the long harbour promenade, and the water-logged delta and beach along the [[Sefid Rud]].

Its wonderful lagoon, Customs and City Hall edifice (Shahrdari), Mian Poshte Palace, and Motamedi Edifice are its tourist attractions. Anzali was the site of the Caspian University of Naval Science until 1980, when it was moved to [[Nowshahr]].

The Sangi Bath was noted for its marvelous durable system of basins with heated water. Some groups think that Motamedi Edifice had been changed; it is now its police office.

==Geography==
[[File:Anzali 3710.jpg|thumb|250px|Tovoos Tower, the tallest tower in Bandar-e Anzali]] 
The [[Anzali Lagoon]] divides the Anzali Port in two parts. The city is connected by two bridges to the ''Beheshti Island''. There is a caviar processing factory in Bandar-e Anzali, some old ruins from 19th century and the popular ''Shanbeh Bazaar''. ''Tourbebar'' is a village about 40 kilometers from Bandar-e Anzali, near the Anzali Lagoon.

===Climate===
Bandar-e Anzali has a [[humid subtropical climate]], with (''Cfa'') designation under the [[Köppen climate classification]] and  (''Cf'') designation under the [[Trewartha climate classification]]. The weather is hot and humid in summers and cool, damp and rainy in winters. It has the most humid climate of any city in Iran, similar in its heavy autumn and early winter rainfall, persistent high humidity and low sunshine to the [[Hokuriku region|Sea of Japan coast]] of Japan, though it receives much less summer rainfall than that region. The warm and humid weather has allowed this region to grow crops such as [[rice]] and [[tea]] that require very large amounts of moisture, especially with the extra water draining from the Elburz Mountains.
