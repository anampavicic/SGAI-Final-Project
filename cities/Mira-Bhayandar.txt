MBMC is currently run by an administrator appointed by the State [[Government of Maharashtra]].

== Economy ==
{{unsourced section|date=January 2024}}
Economic growth is led by the manufacturing sector. [[Bhayandar]] is divided into two parts by the [[Mumbai Suburban district|Mumbai suburban]] rail line - East and West. [[Mira Road]] has seen development only in the East part, while the West part, on the other side of the railway line is covered with [[Salt pan (geology)|salt pans]] and [[mangrove]]s. Mira Road East is a predominantly [[Residential area|residential]] area. Its calm, quiet surroundings and low pollution make it a desirable residential oasis.

Bhayandar West was traditionally residential, and the East predominantly an industrial area in the field of steel utensils manufacturing. Recent population growth and a flurry of construction has blurred the boundaries between Bhayandar and neighboring Mira Road on the East side of the rail tracks, turning it into a populous [[suburb]]. Government-owned Salt Pans and marshland in West Mira Road have restricted the southward spread of Bhayandar. There is a lot of scope for development of this land as it has the potential to house a large industrial complex.
