'''Calumpit''' {{IPA|tl|kɐlʊmˈpit|}}, officially the '''Municipality of Calumpit''' ({{lang-tgl|Bayan ng Calumpit}}, [[kapampangan language|Kapampangan]]: ''Balen ning Calumpit''),  is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Bulacan]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 118,471 people.{{PH census|current}}

== Etymology ==
The name "''Calumpit''" comes from the tree "''[[Terminalia microcarpa|Kalumpít]]''", an indigenous hardwood species similar to ''apalit'' and narra, which grows abundantly in front of the St. John the Baptist Parish Church in the Población-Sucol area.<ref name="Merrill">{{cite book |last1=Merrill |first1=Elmer Drew |location=Manila|title=A Dictionary of the Plant Names of the Philippine Islands |date=1903 |publisher=Bureau of Public Print |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rohIAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA8}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:01233jfPoblacion Calumpit Bulacan Road MacArthur Highwayfvf 18.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Calumpit Poblacion]]

===Precolonial era===
Calumpit was already an established ''[[Barangay state|barangay]]'' under the leadership of Gat Maitim prior to the fall of [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]] in June 1571. Other nearby villages were Gatbuka, Meyto, Meysulao, Pandukot, [[Malolos]], [[Macabebe]], [[Hagonoy, Bulacan|Hagonoy]], and [[Apalit]]. When Calumpit was Hispanized and established as a political and geographical entity in 1572, they chose what is today Barangay Población as the site of the church and the administrative center of the aforementioned villages, which were annexed to it.

===Spanish period===
Upon hearing that the Kingdom of Tondo was conquered by Martín de Goíti and [[Juan de Salcedo|Juan Salcedo]], and that [[Rajah Matanda]] allied with the Spaniards in May 1571, Bambalito formed a fleet of two thousand natives mostly from Hagonoy and Macabebe. They sailed across [[Manila Bay]] to Tondo on 3 June 1571, facing Goíti and Salcedo in the historic [[Battle of Bangkusay]]. Bambalito and the natives were defeated, and the conquerors proceeded northwards to pacify other villages along the coast of Manila Bay.

In September 1571, Goíti and Salcedo, along with the invading forces, arrived at [[Lubao, Pampanga|Lubao]]. On 14 November 1571, they reached Calumpit and Malolos and reported it to [[Miguel López de Legazpi]], the first Spanish [[Governor-General of the Philippines]]. The two settlements were then constituted as the Encomienda de Calumpit and Encomienda de Malolos, respectively. The Encomienda de Calumpit was entrusted to Sargento Juan Moron, one of the conquerors in the Legazpi Expedition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philippinehistory.net/first50/encomiendas.htm|title=The Philippine Islands|author=Blair and Robertson|date=|pages=304–310|volume=34|access-date=2014-08-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924072336/http://www.philippinehistory.net/first50/encomiendas.htm|archive-date=2015-09-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Christianization====
It is uncertain as to exactly when the Augustinians first set foot in Calumpit, but according to the documents, Calumpit was already a parish by 3 May 1572, when Fray Martín de Rada was elected Prior Provincial. Calumpit was simultaneously established with the conventos of [[Bay, Laguna]], [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]] and [[Lubao, Pampanga]], with De Rada as its prior and Fray Diego Vivar as his vicar.

Accounts state that the Augustinian missionaries planted a wooden cross along the bank of the Meyto River to symbolise the baptism of the land, and they built a chapel made of nipa and bamboo. Later, they moved to Meysulao and built another visita, and then in Panducot, where they built another chapel dedicated to [[Visitation (Christianity)|Our Lady of the Visitation]] as Fray Gaspar de San Agustín mentioned in his ''Conquistas delas Isla Philipinas'' (Libro Segundo, Chapter 9). Subsequently, the missionary headquarters was moved again to a much higher place where a very huge and prominent tree called "Kalumpit" (''Terminalia macrocarpa decne'') stands as the original settlers named the place. Another notable characteristic of the village of Calumpit is that it was bounded by rivers which served as a natural moat-like feature. Primarily, Meyto, Meysulao, Panducot and Calumpit was independent barangays under their own chiefs, it is same with Gatbuka, Bugyon and other old settlements. 

On 5 April 1572, Legaspi merged the villages of Meyto, Meysulao, Panducot, Calumpit, Candaba, Apalit and Malolos and these villages became ministerios and visitas and these settlements first formed the town named Calumpit, with present-day Calumpit as center. 

On 28 December 1575, Gov. General Francisco Sande ordered the inclusion of the villages of Agonoy (Hagonoy), Quinabalonan (now Santa Monica and San Jose, Hagonoy), and some villages along Macabebe river to the town of Calumpit.

====Early Spanish presence====
When Calumpit was already pacified by Spaniards and submitted under the colonial rule, On 5 April 1572, Encomiendas of Calumpit and Malolos was unified under the shared administration of their encomenderos Don Marcos de Herrera and Sargento Mayor Juan Moron. One month later on the same year Calumpit was created as one of the centers of the Augustinian ministry in Northern Luzon with Convento de Lubao [[Pampanga]], which includes Betis and Bacolor and Convento de Taal [[Batangas]] established on 3 May 1572, upon the election of Fray Martín de Rada as the new Prior Provincial of the Augustinians replacing Fray Diego de Herrera who was recalled to Mexico. This parochial beginnings of Calumpit have included the old villages of Hagonoy, Apalit, Candaba, Malolos and Macabebe as its missions. The town of Calumpit was originally dedicated to Saint [[Nicholas of Tolentino]], but in December 1576, the town was re-dedicated to the patronage of Saint [[John the Baptist]].<ref>Administracion espiritual de los Padres Agustinos calsados de la Provincia del Duche Nombre de Jesus de las islas Filipinas, Valladolid, Imprenta de H. Roldan, Mayo de 1833, p. 47</ref>

====Province of Calumpit====
On 28 December 1575, Governor-General Francisco de Sande established Calumpit as an Alcaldia (Province) with Marcos de Arce as the first ''Alcalde Mayor'', with Calumpit and nearby visitas and settlements such as Malolos, Hagonoy, Macabebe, Apalit and Candaba. Later in 1576, jurisdiction of Macabebe transferred to the town of Lubao and Candaba separated and became town, then on 11 June 1580, Malolos became a town, and it was transferred to Alcaldia de Bulacan. In 1581, Hagonoy had its own convent but still under the Governor of Calumpit, while in 1591 Apalit officially separated and established as an independent town, and it was transferred in the reconfigured territory of [[Pampanga]] province. In Miguel de Loarca's document in 1581 called ''Relación de las Islas Filipinas'' and the June 1591 document of Governor-General Luis Pérez de Dasmariñas, it is proven that Calumpit appears as an independent Alcaldia, independent of those of Bulacan and Lubao and Betis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/13742/13742-h/13742-h.htm|title=The Philippine Islands, 1493–1898|author=E. H. Blair|date=October 14, 2004|work=gutenberg.org}}</ref> It was therefore established as an Encomienda and Alcaldia separate to [[Province of Bulacan]]. Contrary to popular belief, Calumpit was not only the first town founded in Bulacan, but it existed as a province.

====Abolition====
The Alcaldia de Calumpit was eventually abolished and the towns of Calumpit and Hagonoy were annexed to the Province of Bulacan. Neighbouring Apalit was meanwhile annexed to Pampanga.

=== Philippine Revolution and Philippine-American War ===
During the [[Philippine Revolution]] in 1896, Calumpiteños participated in battles launched by the [[Katipunan]] against the [[Spanish Empire]]. Many notable Calumeteños helped establish and support the [[Malolos Republic]], with the town serving as a defense line due to its proximity to the new capital. When the [[Philippine–American War]] erupted, Calumpit become the headquarters of General [[Antonio Luna]] in 1898. In the bloody encounters at Barrio Bagbag on 25 April 1899, many people joined the army of General Luna.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} During the conflict, the bridge, convent and church of the town were burned and completely destroyed.<ref name="EB1911"/>

Civil administration under the [[United States]]-led [[Insular Government]] was established in Calumpit in April 1901, with Juan Galang serving as the first elected American-era mayor of the town.

===American occupation and World War II===
[[File:Philippine Island - Luzon Island - NARA - 68156757.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Calumpit, circa 1930s]]

Calumpit played an important role at the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in the Pacific theater. The bridge of Calumpit, on the way to [[Bataan]] was demolished by the Engineering Battalion of the U.S., impeding movement of the Japanese forces on their way to Bataan. In January 1942, the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese Government]] occupied Calumpit for three years, during which many of the townsfolk died.

In the middle of 1943, the first part of the [[USAFFE]] guerrilla was established under the leadership of Luis Macam, with most of the members from Calumpit.

In June 1944, the 4th Battalion of the Del Pilar Regiment was established under the leadership of Major Francisco del Rosario. They continued fighting until the returned of the USAFFE under the leadership of General [[Douglas MacArthur]].

In January 1945, the combined Filipino and American troops arrived in the town, liberating it from Japanese control.

===Third republic===
On 18 November 1959, former mayor Fausto Carlos was convicted for the murder of suspected [[Hukbalahap]] rebel Artemio Mutuc at the municipal building 11 years prior and was sentenced to life in prison.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ex-mayor gets life for slay|work=[[The Manila Times]]|publisher=The Manila Times Publishing Company, Inc.|date=November 19, 1959|location=[[Malolos]], [[Bulacan]]|quote=The former town mayor was found guilty of murder in a decision signed by Judge Ambrosio T. Dollete of the third sala of the local court of first instance.}}</ref>

==Geography==
Calumpit is {{convert|50|km}} from [[Manila]] and {{convert|5|km}} from [[Malolos City]].

Calumpit is sprawled over an area of 5,625 has. of flat terrain classified accordingly to use for agricultural (66.81%), residential (10.42%), industrial (2.48%), commercial, (0.89%) and other (1.05%) purposes. It occupies around 2.06% of the total land area of [[Bulacan]]. The municipality has 144.33 kilometers of concrete roads that easily link its 29 barangays.

Two distinct seasons characterize the town's climate: rainy season which starts late May and ends around November; and dry season which begins November and lasts until April.

Calumpit has two types of soil – the silt loam which is found in almost 90% of the entire municipality and the clay loam in the south-east far end of the town. Both types are basically suited for agricultural purposes as per [[Department of Agriculture (Philippines)]] classifications.

===Calumpit River===
[[File:02309jfRiverside Creeks Pampanga River Meysulao Calumpit Bulacanfvf 06.JPG|thumb|Calumpit River]]
The stretch of waterway where two great rivers traversing through Calumpit, the [[Angat River]] and the [[Pampanga River]] is referred to as the ''Calumpit River''.

This river has shaped the lives of Bulakeños since time immemorial. With the longest river system in Bulacan, Calumpit River traverses the towns of Calumpit, [[Pulilan]] and [[Plaridel, Bulacan|Plaridel]] on the east, [[Paombong]] and [[Hagonoy, Bulacan|Hagonoy]] in the West and winds up through [[Apalit]], [[Macabebe]] and [[Masantol]], [[Pampanga]].

It was the major route for trade and commerce in this part of the Luzon prior to the arrival of Spain. The Pampanga and Quingua Rivers<ref name="EB1911">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Calumpit|volume=5|page=69}}</ref> served as arteries through which goods coming in and going out of Calumpit passed. At present, the river is a valued resource as a rich fishing ground and providing farmers with irrigation.

===Climate===
The climate of Calumpit is similar to that of the rest of the other municipalities in the province of Bulacan. It is characterized by two (2) distinct seasons namely, the rainy and the dry. The rainy seasons starts from late May and ends around November, the dry season from December to April. The average annual rainfall is {{convert|255.3|mm}} with the month of August having the highest month average rainfall, about {{convert|304|mm}}. The annual number of rainy days is 175 days.

In the 2020 census, the population of Calumpit was 118,471, {{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|118,471/56.25|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.

Calumpit's population was 101,068 in the Philippine Statistics Authority (NSO) 2010 census. Historically, its population grew at an average of 3.71% per annum.

The [[barangay]] with the largest population is Iba Oeste, with 10,610 residents, while the smallest is Sucol with 1,410 residents.

Calumpit has a relatively young population, with the age group 1–19 years old, constituting 46.01% of the total population. The rest consists mainly of the working group between the ages of 20 to 59 years old accounting for about 47.96% and the elderly comprising 6.02%.

In terms of sex distribution, males exceeded the number of females very slightly with a count of 35,710 and 35,087, respectively.

=== Language ===
Calumpit is a predominantly [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]-speaking town, with about 96.3% of its people being [[fluency|fluent]] speakers. Residents in the northernmost barangays (bordering Apalit) speak [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] while a minority speak other [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]].

===Religion===
[[File:Calumpit Church, Bulacan (February 2020).jpg|thumb|200x200px|San Juan Bautista Parish Church]]
As Calumpit is the first town in Bulacan to have been Christianized by the Spaniards in 1572, about 80% of residents profess the [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Roman Catholic]] faith. Under the United States and because of the eventual [[Philippine Organic Act (1902)#Overview|disestablishment of the Catholic Church]] in the Philippines in 1902, [[Protestantism in the Philippines|Protestantism]] gained a foothold in the municipality. Significant religious minorities include the [[Iglesia ni Cristo]], [[Members Church of God International]], [[Iglesia Filipina Independiente]].

Among the oldest churches in Bulacan found in Calumpit is the [[San Juan Bautista Church (Calumpit)|San Juan Bautista Church]]. Constructed under Augustinian friars Martín de Rada and Diego Vivar, it was initially made of nipa and bamboo and gradually built of stone in 1700. It enshrines the local [[patron saint]], [[John the Baptist]], whose [[Nativity of John the Baptist|liturgical birthday]] on 24 June is celebrated as the town fiesta.

Inside the church is a tunnel that, as legend would have it, was used by priests during the Spanish era as an escape route in the event of Chinese and Moro pirate attacks. It is a declared Diocesan Shrine of the Diocese of Malolos.<ref>{{cite news

[[File:JfMeyto0023ShrineCalumpitfvf 07.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Meyto Shrine]]
The Meyto Shrine marks the cradle of Christianity in western Bulacan, where a wooden cross was first planted and first mass in the region was said in May 1572. The shrine, located in the western part of town, is also the site of the original church of Calumpit, predating the existing one in the town centre. During the Philippine Revolution, the Iglesia Filipina Independiente – which had by then separated from the Catholic Church – took over Meyto Shrine.

=== Labor and employment ===
In 1995, Calumpit had a relatively big labor force of 24,095 or 66% of the population aged 20–59. Around 35% of these skilled and were employed in their respective occupations; 28% were [[housewife|housewives]] with occasional employment as [[farmhand]]s, selling farm produce in the market and doing marginal odd jobs. Others were unclassified and consisted mostly of students, out-of-school youth and the unemployed.

Total household income per annum is ₱705 million, with the annual average household income is ₱66,600 and per capita income annually is ₱12,198.

===Literacy===
The high [[literacy rate]] (98.5%) is maintained by its 24 elementary schools and six secondary or high schools. The Bulacan Manpower and Livelihood Training Center (BMLTC), based at the heart of the town, offers vocational courses and serves as the training ground for both unskilled and highly skilled workers. As a result, most Calumpiteños have acquired and maintained skills suited for employment especially in the agro-industrial field.

==Tourism and culture==
===Festivals===
Calumpit celebrates its town ''fiesta'' from June 23 to 24. The ''Libad'' is a river procession held every [[Saint John's Eve]] on June 23 to honour the town's [[patron saint]]. Calumpiteños sing, dance and douse water to "baptize" passers-by, recalling the saint's characteristic act. The ritual and its traditional route are relics of the old fluvial procession held when Apalit and Hagonoy were still governed from Calumpit. The festivities carry on to the next day, June 24, the feast of Saint [[John the Baptist]].

Every June 23, a day before [[John the Baptist]]'s feast, Calumpit's 29 barangays participate in the "Libad sa Ilog" [[Float_(parade)|fluvial float parade]].<ref>{{cite news |last1= Velez |first1=Freddie |title=Over 100 well-decorated pagodas featured in 'Libad Festival 2023' in Bulacan|url=https://mb.com.ph/2023/6/23/over-a-hundred-well-decorated-pagodas-colored-the-calumpit-river-on-libad-festival-2023 |accessdate=June 28, 2024 |publisher=[[Manila Bulletin]] |date=June 24, 2023}}</ref> Well-decorated [[Boat|pagodas]] pass along Calumpit River, the historic site of [[Battle of Calumpit]] from Barangays Gatbuca and Bagbag (Caniogan-Santo Niño) bridges passing Iba O Este along [[w:en:MacArthur_Highway|MacArthur Highway]] towards the [[San Juan Bautista Church (Calumpit)|San Juan Bautista Church]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Velez |first1=Freddie |title=Thousands of Bulakenyos, tourists join Calumpit’s Libad Festival 2024|url= https://mb.com.ph/2024/6/23/thousands-of-bulakenyos-tourists-join-calumpit-s-libad-festival-2024|accessdate=June 28, 2024 |publisher= [[Manila Bulletin]]|date=June 24, 2024}}</ref>

One of the oldest barangays in the town, established in 1575, Santa Lucia is very popular and famous because of the supposedly miraculous image of its [[patron saint|patroness]], [[Saint Lucy]]. During the village festival, every December 12–13, the streets of the village are strung with colorful ''banderitas'', as is the façade of Santa Lucia Church. Pilgrims visit the church for the two-day celebration, with the [[novena]] to the saint beginning on December 4.

====Calumpit longganisa festival====
On March 24-25, 2023, the town's 451st Founding [[Anniversary]], Mayor Glorime M. Faustino led the 1st [[Calumpit longganisa]] Festival with a 514 meters "Longest [[Kamayan|Boodle Fight]]" along  [[Philippine highway network|Pulilan Regional Road]]. 3,000 people who participated from Barangays Caniogan and Corazon ate the star "Longganisang Bawang" of Bikers Longganisa makers.
