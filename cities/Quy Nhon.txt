'''Quy Nhon''' ({{lang-vi|Quy Nhơn}} {{IPA|vi|kwi ɲəːŋ|lang|Qui Nhon.ogg}}) is a coastal city in [[Bình Định province]] in central [[Vietnam]]. It is composed of 16 [[ward (Vietnam)|wards]] and five communes with a total of {{convert|286|km2|abbr=on}}. Quy Nhon is the capital of Bình Định province. As of 2022 its population was 481.110.<ref name=ds09/> Historically, the commercial activities of the city focused on agriculture and fishing. In recent years, however, there has been a significant shift towards service industries and tourism. There is also a substantial manufacturing sector.

==History==
The origins of human settlement stretch back to the 11th-century [[Champa]] culture, the [[Tây Sơn dynasty]] as well as the 18th-century [[Port of Thi Nai|seaport of Thị Nại]]. The city was subject to a Mongol invasion in the [[Battle of Thị Nại Bay|Battle of Thị Nại Bay (1283)]] during the [[Mongol invasions of Vietnam]]. During the [[Ming treasure voyages]] of the 15th century, the Chinese fleet led by Admiral [[Zheng He]] would always make port at Quy Nhon in Champa as their first destination after leaving China.<ref>{{cite book | last=Dreyer | first=Edward L. | title=Zheng He: China and the Oceans in the Early Ming Dynasty, 1405–1433 | year=2007 | publisher=Pearson Longman | location=New York | isbn=9780321084439 | author-link=Edward L. Dreyer | page=52}}</ref> During the 1620s the town was host to Portuguese Jesuits who called the place Pulo Cambi. 

The town of Quy Nhon was officially founded in the late 19th century by Emperor [[Thành Thái]]. It was also the site of the [[Bombardment of Qui Nhơn]] in 1861, and more recently, it had a large American and Korean military presence, especially the [[Capital Mechanized Infantry Division]] of the [[Republic of Korea Army]] during the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name="Larsen">{{cite book|last1=Larsen|first1=Stanley|last2=Collins|first2=Lawton|title=Allied Participation in Vietnam|publisher=Department of the Army|year=1985|url=https://history.army.mil/html/books/090/90-5-1/index.html|isbn=9781410225016|page=130}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>

Today the city is recognized as a first class city with a geo-economic priority and an urbanized infrastructure. The government describes it as one of the three commercial and tourism centres of the central southern coastal region (with [[Da Nang]] and [[Nha Trang]]).

==Geography==
[[File:QuyNhonBeach1.jpg|thumb|left|240px|The beachfront at Quy Nhon]]

Quy Nhon has a varied topography, being extremely diversified with mountains and forests, hills, fields, salt marshes, plains, lagoons, lakes, rivers, shorelines, peninsulas and islands. Its coastline is {{convert|42|km|mi|0|disp=or}} long with sandy beaches, abundant seafood resources and other natural products of economic value. [[Hà Thanh River]] flows through city.

The city has sixteen wards: Trần Hưng Đạo, Lê Lợi, Lê Hồng Phong, Trần Phú, Lý Thường Kiệt, Nguyễn Văn Cừ, Đống Đa, Thị Nại, Hải Cảng, Ngô Mây, Ghềnh Ráng, Quang Trung, Nhơn Bình, Nhơn Phú, Bùi Thị Xuân and Trần Quang Diệu. It has five villages: Nhơn Lý, Nhơn Hội, Nhơn Châu, Nhơn Hải and Phước Mỹ (which was spun off from Tuy Phước district and merged into Quy Nhon city in 2006) with a total area of {{convert|284.28|sqkm|sqmi|2|disp=or}} and a population of about 284,000 people.

==Climate==
Quy Nhon has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (''Am''), very close to being classified as a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''As''), with year round very warm to hot temperatures and distinct wet and dry seasons. The city is occasionally hit by the tail-end of typhoons hitting further up the coast.<ref name="kottek2006">{{cite journal|last1=Kottek|first1=Markus|last2=Grieser|first2=Jürgen|last3=Beck|first3=Christoph|last4=Rudolf|first4=Bruno |last5=Rubel|first5=Franz|title=World Map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification updated|journal=Meteorologische Zeitschrift|date=2006|volume=15|issue=3|pages=259–263|doi=10.1127/0941-2948/2006/0130|bibcode=2006MetZe..15..259K|url=https://opus.bibliothek.uni-augsburg.de/opus4/files/40083/metz_Vol_15_No_3_p259-263_World_Map_of_the_Koppen_Geiger_climate_classification_updated_55034.pdf}}</ref><ref name=Peel>{{cite journal |author1=Peel, M.

==Transportation==
[[File:Phucatairport2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Phu Cat Airport]]]]
Quy Nhon is served by [[Vietnam Airlines]], [[Bamboo Airways]], [[VietJet Air]] and [[Pacific Airlines]] through [[Phu Cat Airport]], with flights to [[Hanoi]] and [[Ho Chi Minh City]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Domestic flights in Vietnam|url=http://www.indochinatravelservice.com/flight/domestic_flights_in_vietnam.html|work=Indochina Travel Service|publisher=Dong Duong Co|access-date=15 October 2012|language=vi, en|year=2012}}</ref>

[[Quy Nhơn railway station]] could be reached by a branch off the main line of the [[North–South railway (Vietnam)|North–South railway]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Vietnam Railways |url=http://www.vr.com.vn/English/hientaihoatdong.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418132723/http://www.vr.com.vn/English/hientaihoatdong.html |archive-date=April 18, 2010 |access-date=November 21, 2009}}</ref> but this line was suspended in May 2016. Reunification express trains stop only in [[Diêu Trì railway station]], which is around {{convert|10|km|mi|0|disp=or}} west of Quy Nhon.

== Economy ==
[[Image:FLC Quy Nhơn.jpg|thumb|300px|View from FLC Luxury Hotel Quy Nhơn]]
Quy Nhon is one of the main industrial centres of the [[South Central Coast]], behind only Da Nang and Nha Trang.<ref name="Atlat">Atlat Dia li Viet Nam (Geographical Atlas of Vietnam). NXB Giao Duc, Hanoi: 2010</ref> It is also the major industrial and service centre of [[Bình Định Province]], including its largest industrial facilities at [[Phu Tai Industrial Park]] and [[Nhơn Hội Economic Zone]]. The city's economic activities include industries, export-imports, seaport services, aquatic product husbandry and tourism. The [[Economic indicator|economic trend]], at present, is increasingly service-based at the expense of agriculture, forestry and [[pisciculture]].

Cereals are cultivated on 2548 ha of Quy Nhon's land with an output of 13,021 tons as of 2009, just 2% of the province's total.<ref name=BDSO10>Bình Định Statistics Office (2010): Bình Định Statistical Yearbook 2009. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi</ref> Other crops included 10,891 tons of vegetables, 2,795 tons of sugar-cane, as well as smaller amounts of coconuts, peanuts and cashew nuts.<ref name=BDSO10/>

Much of the city's industry is concentrated in and around Phu Tai Industrial Park in the west of the city along National Route 1A. Quy Nhon is a major centre of garden furniture manufacturing. It has traditionally been relying on access to wood from Bình Định's forests as well as the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] provinces of [[Gia Lai province|Gia Lai]] and [[Kon Tum province|Kon Tum]] and even as far as [[Cambodia]]'s [[Ratanakiri]] and [[Laos]]' [[Attapeu province]]. Most of the furniture factories are located in Phu Tai Industrial Park. Several chemical enterprises that supply the furniture and [[wood processing]] industry have been set up in the vicinity of the industrial park.<ref>People's Committee Bình Định (2007): ''Yearbook of Information on Enterprises in Bình Định Province''. Labour Publishing House, Hanoi: 162–165</ref>

Other industries in Quy Nhon process agricultural and aquatic products, or produce construction materials and paper products.<ref name="Atlat"/> [[Bidiphar]] is a pharmaceutical company headquartered in Quy Nhon that is an exception to the city's general focus on basic and [[wood processing]] industries. [[Nhơn Hội Economic Zone]] is central to the city's and province's industrial development plans. However, as of late 2010 it was still in the early stages of development, with few factories completed.

Quy Nhon has seen only limited foreign investment. As of 2008, thirteen foreign companies employed 1119 people in the city.<ref name=BDSO10/>

Currently the economic structure of Quy Nhon is a shift towards increasing the proportion of service industries, reducing the rate of agriculture, forestry and fisheries in GDP. The shares of agriculture, forestry and fisheries – industrial and construction – services in GDP in 2006 reached 36.7%, 28% and 35.3%, respectively, while in 2005 it was at 38.4%, 26.7% and 34.9%, respectively.

The income per capita in 2018 was US$6,025 per person.

== Education ==
[[File:Một góc Quốc học Quy Nhơn.jpg|thumb|240px|Quốc học Quy Nhơn high school]]
Quy Nhon has two universities: [[Quy Nhon University]] and [[Quang Trung University]]. As of 2009 they had a total teaching staff of 601 and 23,383 students, 13,704 of whom were female.<ref name=BDSO10/> There were 19,900 primary school students and 28,500 secondary school students.<ref name=BDSO10/>

== Cuisine ==
Quy Nhon is home to multiple domestically famous Vietnamese dishes: 
* '''Bánh xèo tôm nhảy''' (jumping-shrimps fried pancake): These pancakes are made with special formulas and each restaurant has its own way of making distinguished dipping fish sauce for this dish.
* '''Bánh hỏi cháo lòng''': The dish composes of two sub-dishes: "[[Bánh hỏi]]" (a type of rice cake in Vietnam) and "cháo lòng" (pig's internal organs porridge).
* '''Bún chả cá''' (fish-cake rice vermicelli).
* '''Chả ram tôm đất''' (shrimp spring roll).
