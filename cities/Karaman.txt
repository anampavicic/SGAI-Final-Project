==Etymology==
The town owes its name to [[Karaman Bey]], who was one of the rulers of the [[Karamanid]] dynasty. The former name ''Laranda'' which in turn comes from the [[Luwian language]] ''Larawanda'', literally means "sandy, a sandy place".<ref>[[Bilge Umar]]. ''Türkiye'deki Tarihsel Adlar''. İnkılap Kitabevi, 1993. {{ISBN|975-10-0539-6}}.</ref>

==History==
[[File:Karaman Müze 01.jpg|left|thumb|[[Karaman Museum]].]]
In ancient times, Karaman was known as Lānda in [[Hittites|Hittite]] and Laranda<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Karaman |volume=15 |page=676}}</ref> ({{langx|el|Λάρανδα}}). In the 6th century BC it came under [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] rule until 322 BC, when it was destroyed by [[Perdiccas]],<ref name=EB1911/> a former general of [[Alexander the Great]], after he had defeated [[Ariarathes I of Cappadocia|Ariarathes I]], king of [[Cappadocia]].<ref>Diodorus Siculus 18.22.1-2</ref>
It later became a seat of [[Isaurians|Isaurian]] pirates. At some point it was possessed by [[Antipater of Derbe]].<ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-grc1:12.6.3 Strabo, Geography, §12.6.3]</ref>
It belonged to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and later [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Empires]] until it was captured by the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuks]] in the early 12th century. Karaman was occupied by [[Frederick Barbarossa]] in 1190<ref name=EB1911/> and by the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] between 1211 and 1216. In 1256, the town was taken by Karaman Bey and was renamed Karaman in his honour. From 1275, Karaman was the capital of the [[Karamanid]] [[Anatolian beyliks|beylik]].

In 1468 the Karamanids were conquered by the Ottomans and in 1483 the capital of the province was moved to [[Konya]]. Karaman has retained ruins of a Karamanid castle and some walls, two [[mosques]] and a [[Koran]] school (''[[madrasah]]'') from that age. A [[mihrab]] from a mosque from Karaman can now be found in the [[Tiled Kiosk|Çinili Pavilion]] near the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum|Archeology Museum]] in [[Istanbul]].
The Karamanslis were Cappadocian Turkomans who fought the Ottomans. Later they integrated into the empire.

There was a [[Roman Catholic]] [[titular see]] for the city.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Laranda}}</ref>
The poet [[Yunus Emre]] ({{Circa|1238–1320}}) resided in Karaman during his later years and is believed to lie buried beside the Yunus Emre Mosque. A small adjacent park is adorned with quotations from his verse, many of them [[graffiti]]-splattered. In 1222, the [[Sufi]] preacher Bahaeddin Veled arrived in town with his family, and the Karamanoğlu [[emir]] built a ''madrasah'' to accommodate them. Veled's son was the famous [[Rumi]], who married his wife, Gevher Hatun, while his family was living in Karaman. It was here, too, that Rumi's mother died in 1224. She was buried, along with other family members, in the Aktekke Mosque (also known as the Mader-i Mevlana Cami), which Alaeddin Ali Bey had built to replace the original ''madrasah'' in 1370.<ref>{{cite web|title=Today's Zaman|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=144184&bolum=117|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120629231929/http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=144184&bolum=117|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-06-29}}, todayszaman.com</ref>

When [[First Barbary War|Thomas Jefferson fought Libya's Barbary pirates]], he replaced one member of the al-Qaramanli dynasty with another as Pasha.
