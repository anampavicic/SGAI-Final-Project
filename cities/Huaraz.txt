'''Huaraz''' ({{IPA|es|waˈɾas|}}) (from [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]]: '''''Waraq''''' or '''''Warash''''', "''dawn''"), formerly designated as '''San Sebastián de Huaraz''', is a city in [[Peru]]. It is the capital of the [[Ancash Region]] (State of Ancash) and the seat of government of [[Huaraz Province]]. The urban area's population is distributed over the districts of Huaraz and Independencia. The city is located in the middle of the [[Callejón de Huaylas|Callejon de Huaylas]] valley and on the right side of the [[Santa River|Santa river]]. The city has an elevation of approximately 3050 meters above sea level. The built-up area covers 8 square kilometers and has a population of 120,000 inhabitants, making it the second largest city in the central Peruvian Andes after the city of [[Huancayo]]. It is the 22nd largest city in Peru. Huaraz is the seat of the province's Roman Catholic Bishop and the site of the cathedral.

Huaraz is the main financial and trade center of the Callejón de Huaylas and the main tourist destination of Ancash region. Moreover, it is one of the biggest towns in the Peruvian [[Andes]]. Huaraz is the main destinations for winter sports and adventure. Many visitors from around the world come to the city for practicing sports as climbing, hiking, mountain biking and snowboarding, and also to visit the glaciers and mountains of the [[Cordillera Blanca]], mainly [[Huascarán|Mount Huascarán]], which is considered the tallest mountain in the tropics, all of them located in [[Huascarán National Park]] which UNESCO declared a nature world heritage site in 1985.

The city was founded before the [[Inca Empire]] when humans settled around the valley of the Santa River and [[Qillqaywank'a|Qillqay]]. Its Spanish occupation occurred in 1574 as a Spanish-indigenous reducción. During the wars for the independence of Peru, the whole city supported the Liberating Army with food and guns, earning the city the title of "Noble and Generous City" granted by [[Simón Bolívar]]. In 1970, 95% of the city was destroyed by an earthquake that damaged much of Ancash Region. 25,000 people died. The city received much foreign assistance from many countries. For this reason the city was named a capital of International Friendship.

The main economic activities in the city are farming, commerce and tourism. Since Huaraz has tourist infrastructure supporting the Ancash Highlands, the city is the main point of arrival for practitioners of adventure sports and mountaineering. Along with the snowy peaks of the Cordillera Blanca, one can visit archaeological sites like [[Chavín de Huantar]] and the eastern highlands of Ancash, known as Conchucos.

==Etymology==
The name of the city comes from the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] word "Waraq", which means "sunrise".<ref>{{Citation|last=Everett-Heath|first=John|title=Huaraz|date=2020-10-22|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191905636.001.0001/acref-9780191905636-e-10852|work=Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Place Names|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780191905636.001.0001|isbn=978-0-19-190563-6|access-date=2022-01-31}}</ref> The pre-Hispanic inhabitants of the area had a god called "Waraq quyllur", which means "morning star" or the planet Venus, because it is the star that is seen at sunrise.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Guerrero|first1=Félix Julca|last2=Vargas|first2=Laura Nivin|date=2020-12-14|title=Una aproximación al desarrollo sociocultural de Huaraz|url=http://revistas.unasam.edu.pe/index.php/saber_discursivo/article/view/722|journal=Saber Discursivo|language=es|volume=1|issue=1|page=107|issn=2810-8299}}</ref>

==Geography==

===Location===
[[File:Mountains seen from Huaraz to the north.jpg|thumb|View from a rooftop in Huaraz to the north, showing the snowy peaks of the Cordillera Blanca]]
[[File:Blick nach Norden über Huaraz auf die schneebedeckten Gipfel der Cordillera Blanca.jpg|thumb|View to the north-east over Huaraz to the peaks of the Cordillera Blanca]]

Huaraz is in north-central Peru, about 420&nbsp;km north of [[Lima]], and at an altitude of {{convert|3052|m}}. It is the largest population center in the agriculturally important [[Callejón de Huaylas]] valley. The Callejón (in Spanish roughly meaning large valley or corridor) is a north–south valley bounded on the east by the [[Cordillera Blanca]] (permanent ''white'' snowcaps and glaciers) and on the west by the [[Cordillera Negra]] (no permanent snowcapped peaks or glaciers, hence ''black''). The Cordillera Blanca includes [[Huascarán]], the highest mountain in Peru at {{convert|6768|m}} and the third highest in the Western Hemisphere. Huascarán and the adjacent peak [[Huandoy]] in fair weather are clearly visible from Huaraz.

The Santa River flows north through Huaraz. It is not commercially navigable but has always furnished the city with good water. The river is a rocky-bottom narrow stream of glacier-fed cold water that flows generally west of center in the Callejón, running north to the valley's north end. There it rushes downward through the narrow [[Cañón del Pato]] (''Duck Canyon''), turns westward at the town of [[Huallanca, Bolognesi|Huallanca]], and continues to the coast where it enters the Pacific Ocean south of the city of [[Chimbote]]. The Santa River is the traditional western boundary of Huaraz, although part of the city's population has lived on the west bank there for as long as two centuries.

The nominal north boundary of Huaraz is along a westward flowing creek that empties into the Santa River. The creek, whose watershed is the westward facing nearby foothills and slopes of the Cordillera Blanca, has twice since 1940 been the channel of devastating earthquake-precipitated floods (see below).

The most recent devastating flood and avalanche along this creek bed was a result of the 1970 earthquake. The avalanche of 1941 had filled the creek valley with debris, covering the new suburb on the city's north edge. The 1970 avalanche and floodwaters down this creek valley destroyed the city's north-side subdivision, which had been partially rebuilt by the late 1960s. The 1970 avalanche debris also created a temporary natural dam across the Santa River, which caused flooding throughout much of the city. The quake damaged almost all the city's major buildings. Over the next few days the city was devastated by flooding from both the creek and the river and by water-borne earthquake debris.

===Orography===
[[File:Huaraz-prairie.JPG|thumb|Huaraz is surrounded by prairies and forests in the middle of the valley.]]

The urban area of Huaraz is located at the Santa River basin. The environment of the city is characteristic of an Andean valley. Huaraz is located in the [[Callejón de Huaylas]] valley, surrounded by the Cordillera Blanca and Cordillera Negra as its system mountains. The main river is the Santa, which crosses the city from south to north, and also the Qillqay river that crosses the urban area from east to west, flowing to the Santa river.

The territory surrounding Huaraz is heterogeneous, mountainous and rough; because of that its slopes have gradients varying between 2% and 25% in the central zone and 15% and 45% in the outskirts.

===Layout===
[[File:Huarazlasoledad.jpg|thumb|La Soledad neighbourhood in the central district]]

Huaraz in its beginning had an architecture composed of circular houses, after that, they were demolished in order to build square houses and narrow streets on a grid plan. The main square used to be wide and was signed at downtown, it was surrounded by the Big Cathedral, the city hall, the jail, the governor in colonial times established his residence in Huaraz, for that reason the city was elevated to the category of region capital.<ref name="Urban Characteristics">[http://www.munihuaraz.gob.pe/publica/Plan_preven_I.pdf Municipalidad de Huaraz] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407083027/http://www.munihuaraz.gob.pe/publica/Plan_preven_I.pdf |date=7 April 2014 }}. ''Urban Characteristics'' (2011). Retrieved on 24 August 2012.</ref>

Of the quiet, silent, old city with big mansions made of mud and gabled-roofs with narrow streets, only José Olaya street remains. It was declared a national heritage site, because the 1970s earthquake destroyed 95% of the city and all the traditional and colonial architecture disappeared, except Olaya Street, robbing the city of its traditional identity.<ref name="Urban Characteristics"/>

The grid plan of Huaraz has changed and disappeared the original composition of four neighbourhoods, as La Soledad (downtown), Belén, Huarupampa and San Francisco.
 
For its rebuilding after the earthquake, the government had to demolish the damaged houses. After that, the city was planned with a modern physiognomy like wide streets and avenues with central gardens. Colonial architecture doesn't exist, it was modernized in its own Andean style of [[gable]]d roofs. The city has a modern and planned design, made for Gunther-Seminario Company. Despite that the city grows in a disorganized way. On the other hand, the city had a great commercial movement, and high-quality tourist services. Nevertheless, the rapid urbanization resulted in irregular neighbourhoods.<ref name="Urban Characteristics"/>

The city grew in a longitudinal way from north to south, Only in central downtown there are buildings with more than 3 or 4 floors. Many of the buildings were modified, in order to rent apartments and lofts.

===Neighborhoods===
The metropolitan area is composed of two districts, Huaraz and Independencia. These are also divided into neighborhoods and settlements, and they also are divided in two or more parts. the majority of neighborhoods are located in Huaraz District, especially the traditional areas like La Soledad, Belén, Huarupampa and San Francisco, that are surrounding the downtown, and its residents are in 60% the traditional citizens of Huaraz. This neighbourhoods, are in great part from middle class. On the other hand, surrounding these areas, there are other settlements that have developed without planning. In the District of Independencia there are other middle- and upper-class neighborhoods. Centenario is the most extensive area in the city. At this area many rural migrants has established developing informal neighbourhoods. The tendency of city's growing is on the north-east part of the city. In north direction has developed areas of recent creation, especially for people searching an ecological area for establish.

===Climate===
Huaraz has a warm moderated weather of tropical mountain. It is sunny and dry during the morning and cold past the evening, with temperatures between 11 and 17&nbsp;°C and maximum temperatures that can exceed 21&nbsp;°C. During the rainy season, from December to March, rainfall can be between 500&nbsp;mm and 1000&nbsp;mm. The dry season, spanning from April to November, is also known as "Andean summer".

== History ==

=== Pre-Columbian era ===
[[File:Plano-Huaraz-1782.jpg|thumb|Map of Huaraz from 1782, indicating the location of the Pumacayan shrine]]
Human presence in the area dates back to around 10,000 B.C., when the inhabitants were hunters and gatherers. Evidence of this is found in the [[Guitarrero Cave|Guitarreros cave]] across from the town of Mancos. Over time, the area underwent significant changes with the development of agriculture in the zone of Vicuas and Villaqui.

During the [[Early Horizon]] epoch, the [[Chavín culture]] influenced the region and it has been proposed by that the ceremonial center located at Pumacayan hill had its beginnings during this period.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lumbreras |first=Luis Guillermo |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AOB8AAAAMAAJ |title=Chavín de Huántar en el nacimiento de la civilización andina |date=1989 |publisher=Ediciones INDEA, Instituto Andino de Estudios Arqueológicos |language=es}}</ref> During the [[Early Intermediate]] period, the [[Recuay culture]] emerged in the area. Following this, in the [[Middle Horizon]], the area of Huaraz was conquered by the [[Wari culture]], this empire built the archaeological rests of [[Wilcahuaín|Wilcahuain]] and Waullac.

During the [[Late Intermediate Period]], Huaraz was an important town in the kingdom of Huaylas or Wayllas prior to Inca occupation in the [[Late Horizon]]. During the reign of the ninth Inca ruler [[Pachacuti]], the military leaders [[Capac Yupanqui (general)|Capac Yupanqui]] and [[Tupac Inca Yupanqui]] waged a conquest war against the Huaylas and their allied neighbors as part of the Inca expansion efforts in the [[Chinchaysuyo]]. After the war, the kingdom was reconstituted a Inca ''hunu'', divided into the two traditional moieties of ''hanan'' and ''hurin'', with hurin being subordinate to hanan. Huaraz was the seat of the Hurin or Lower Huaylas moiety.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Soriano |first=Waldermar Espinoza |date=2013-06-17 |title=Etnia Guaylla (ahora Huaylas) |url=https://revistasinvestigacion.unmsm.edu.pe/index.php/sociales/article/view/7882 |journal=Investigaciones Sociales |language=es |volume=17 |issue=30 |pages=179–190 |doi=10.15381/is.v17i30.7882 |issn=1818-4758 |quote=Ahora sabemos que Huaraz constituía la saya o mitad de Lurin-Huayla.}}</ref>

Following its incorporation into the Inca Empire, the Incas soon made architectural interventions at Pumacayan, which held the principal [[wak'a]] of the Huaylas people. This might explain why [[Pedro Cieza de León]] records two local versions about the origin of Pumacayan: one tracing it as a monument or fortress of the Inca to commemorate winning a “certain battle” and the other stating that it dates to far ancient times. Cieza refers to Pumacayan as a "large fortress" because it featured imposing walls that enclosed the buildings and considered it to be one of the most impressive complexes in Peru. However, almost all the constructions within Pumacayan were eventually dismantled for building materials in later centuries. Excavations conducted in 2003 suggest the administrative nature of Pumacayan during the time of the Incas.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-11-09 |title=El Libro Azul |url=https://issuu.com/gibergarcia/docs/libro_azul_-_n__8_-_2016 |access-date=2024-08-24 |website=issuu.com |language=es}}</ref>

As part of the integration efforts of the [[Tawantinsuyo]], the Incas implemented a policy of marriages between Inca and Huaylas nobles. The daughters of the two kings of the Huaylas diarchy were given as secondary wives to the heir of the Emperor Tupac Inca Yupanqui, [[Huayna Capac]]. The ruler of Hurin Huaylas, Huacachillar Apo, gave his daughter, Añas Colque, who was taken to be educated as an Inca noble in [[Cusco]]. In her old age, Añas Colque ruled the Hurin Huaylas.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Canseco |first=María Rostworowski de Diez |date=1999-03-10 |title=Los curacas costeños |url=https://revistas.pucp.edu.pe/index.php/historica/article/view/8759 |journal=Histórica |language=es |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=283–311 |doi=10.18800/historica.199902.006 |issn=2223-375X |quote=La segunda mitad de Huaylas, es decir Rurinhuaylas o Luringuaylas, perteneció a otra mujer secundaria del mismo Inca llamada Añas Colque (Espinoza 1976).}}</ref> From the marriage between the Emperor Huayna Capac and Añas Colque was born the influential aristocrat [[Paullu Inca|Paullo Inca]], Paullo later collaborated with the Spanish and served as [[Sapa Inca]] during the early years following the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish conquest]].

In 1533, while stationed in [[Cajamarca]], Francisco Pizarro sent his brother, [[Hernando Pizarro]], along with a small expeditionary party, to [[Pachacamac]] and back to collect part of [[Atahualpa]]'s ransom, sponsored by the captive Inca himself. During the journey, Hernando provided the first description of the precolonial city of Huaraz, and he also noted the fertile green soil of the [[Callejón de Huaylas]], along with its significant livestock in the highlands and the prosperous towns and villages.<blockquote>"The next day, the captain [Hernando Pizarro] departed from that town; and through the valley, he went to dine in a large town called Guarax [Warash], with the Lord of Pumacapllai, where he and his Indians were well provided with food and people to carry the loads. This town is situated on a plain, with a river running alongside it."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Raimondi |first=Antonio |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXNzEkgH824C&pg=PA37 |title="El" Peru: Historia de geografía del Perú : libro primero. t. 2 |date=1876 |publisher=Estado |language=es |quote=El dia siguiente partió el Capitan de aquel Pueblo; i por el valle fue á comer á un pueblo grande, que se dice Guarax, i el Señor de Pumacapllai: donde él, i de sus Indios, fué bien proveido de comida, i gente para llevar las cargas.

===Colonial era===
[[Francisco Pizarro]], known as the Spanish [[conquistador]] of Peru, in 1538 granted the right to collect taxes in the area within what is now the province of Huaraz to his subordinate Sebastián de Torres. Alonso de Santoyo founded on 20 January 1574 a Hispanic Indigenous reduction (Reducción Hispano Indígena) with the name of Pampa Huarás de San Sebastián, with 14 quarters. Later its political creation, dated on 12 February 1821, while General [[José de San Martín]] was staying in [[Huaura]] (city north from Lima) founded 4 Departments, including Huaylas as one of them, with its capital, the city of Caraz. Finally on 1857, it was split in two, giving birth to the new young province of Huaraz with its capital, the nowadays, City of Huaraz.

From the beginning the Spaniards began exploiting the mineral wealth of the region. Several deposits of metal ores were discovered: silver, lead, and tin, among others. Availability of these metals for mining and smelting locally was the primary attraction of the Callejón area to Spain. Hundreds of the native Quechua-speakers by the 1570s were laboring in the mines.

As in other areas of Spanish settlement in the Andean countries most agricultural works such as native irrigation canals and terraces were appropriated or destroyed by the colonial administrators. The Spaniards did not call their tactics ''slavery'', though in fact the effects were the same. Disappearances and unexplained deaths were common for resistors. The entire population of some villages was forcibly marched long distances and resettled. To identify those who tried to return to their prior homes, the native peoples were required to wear distinctive clothing identifiable by areas or provinces. The Spanish [[patron]] or [[hacendado]] often chose for those people under his control a costume copied from his home region in Spain. These costumes are now a source of regional and national pride among many Andeans who identify with their native ancestry.

===Contemporary times===
[[File:Urbanizacion-Huarupampa.jpg|thumb|right|Modern neighbourhoods were built after 1970s earthquake]]
{{original research|section|date=October 2013}}
Much of the north side and a large part of the center of the city was destroyed in 1941 by floodwaters and avalanche debris because of a burst reservoir from [[Lake Palcacocha]] that was the city's municipal water supply. The reservoir dam was about {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the town and more than 200 meters elevation above it. The dam failed because of sudden overflow pressure from an avalanche of glacier ice probably caused by a localized tremor (earthquake). Within a few minutes the stream bed was filled with an avalanche of water, mud, boulders, and associated debris whose crest by the time it reached the city may have exceeded 15 meters height above the stream bed. In as few as four minutes after the dam burst the avalanche obliterated and covered the city's most modern suburb and destroyed most of the north half of the city. 4,000 died.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/196211/1962-06#page/n173/mode/2up National Geographic June 1962]</ref>
 
After the 1941 disaster the old reservoir dam was repaired but not replaced. Doubts about the safety of the dam were largely responsible for abandonment of that area for redevelopment. The creek valley upstream from the city in the mid-1960s exhibited scarred inner banks several meters higher than the normal water level. The scarring caused by the avalanche was increasingly higher above the stream bed on the creek valley walls nearer the reservoir. The scoured appearance of the creek valley indicated the mass and power of the avalanche gaining momentum as it crashed down the narrow valley, accumulating debris as it descended.

By 1965 fewer than a half dozen buildings had been rebuilt in the creek valley adjacent north of the city. The valley was still filled by as many as three meters of soil and debris deposited by the 1941 avalanche. Giant boulders lay about, some protruding as many as four meters above the 1965 creek bed level. Many boulders from the 1941 avalanche were strewn down to the confluence of the creek with the Santa River. Huaraz area residents who remembered the disaster of 1941 said in 1965 that the river itself was diverted by avalanche debris for some days until eroded away and carried downstream (northward), and there were boulders on the west bank that had come with the avalanche.<!--citing my personal observations; for six months in 1965 I was (as a US Peace Corps volunteer) a resident of Huaraz ~~~~-->

On 31 May 1970 the same reservoir dam burst during the [[1970 Ancash earthquake|Ancash earthquake]],<ref>http://www.munihuaraz.gob.pe/muni2/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=541{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref> which had a [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 7.9 and a maximum [[Mercalli intensity scale|Mercalli intensity]] of VIII (Severe). Down the creek valley, again came an avalanche, eerily similar to that of 1941. In the prior four years or so, the suburb had begun to again be redeveloped: numerous residences were built atop the 1941 avalanche deposit within the at-risk creek valley. Within its duration of 45 seconds, virtually every structure of consequence in the city's center was destroyed. A few minutes later, the north half of the city, particularly in the creek valley, was obliterated by an avalanche of icy mud carrying boulders and other debris.

As many as 20,000 people were killed within the city; there were reported only 91 survivors within the city itself. The historic structures along the narrow streets, particularly the big [[adobe]] ''casonas'' (large houses) roofed with ceramic tiles, were reduced to rubble. The main square was evident by the dearth of rubble; the city was rebuilt around it. Where once stood the old ''casonas'' and their high-walled compounds now there are smaller buildings. The narrow streets had been deathtraps during the quake; the post-1970 city design has wider, more modern streets.

==Demographics==
{{As of|2017|alt=According to the [[2017 Peru Census]]}}, the Huaraz metropolitan area has a population of 118,836. After the earthquake that the city suffered in 1970, fifty percent of people in the city died. Nonetheless, the city was rebuilt and attracted internal migrants, especially from rural areas in the region. During the decade of the 1990s, the Pierina gold mine was established in the region, attracting people from other parts of the country to settle in the city.

The official language in the city is Spanish, which is spoken for the majority of Huaraz's residents. A minority of people speaks Quechua, especially in rural areas where it is more predominant.

==Transportation==

===Roads===
Huaraz is connected to the Pacific coast by three highways. One goes generally westward, another goes south then west, and the other goes north then west. All three roads go from the Andes down into the desert coastal region.

The westward route rises into the [[Cordillera Negra]], crests at about 4000 m (ca. 13,100&nbsp;ft), then winds downward in altitude to the coastal city of [[Casma]] on the Pan American Highway. (Casma is the largest population center between the cities of Lima and [[Chimbote]].)

The southward route from Huaraz goes about 40&nbsp;km toward the town of Recuay, where it turns west. It rises to about 4,300 m (ca. 14,000&nbsp;ft) where it crests the south part of the Cordillera Negra. From there the narrow winding highway in a distance of about 80&nbsp;km (ca. 60 miles) descends to the town of Huarmey (south of Casma) on the coast. Here it connects with the [[Pan-American Highway]] (187&nbsp;km north of Lima).

The northward route going north from Huaraz follows the Rio Santa to the north end of the Callejón de Huaylas, where it branches into two. The minor branch goes steeply westward up to the ancient town of Huaylas and then northwestward down to the coast. The main highway goes north beside the [[Cañón del Pato]] through a dozen one-lane tunnels, precipitously descends several thousand meters by switch-backs and hairpin curves on the one-lane rocky roadway, and arrives at the town of Huallanca. Here there is a connection with the Santa Railway. The highway again splits. The most heavily traveled fork continues generally west to the coastal city of Chimbote where it connects with the Pan-American Highway. The other fork goes from Huallanca northward and upward into the northern Peruvian Andes.

Travel by vehicle via any of the three highway routes from Huaraz to the coast generally requires seven to eight hours to either Lima or Chimbote.
