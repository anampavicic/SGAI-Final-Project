'''Nampula''' {{IPA|pt|nɐ̃ˈpulɐ|}} is the capital city of [[Nampula Province]] in Northern [[Mozambique]]. With a population of 743,125 (2017 census),<ref>{{Cite web |date=2009-11-24 |title=Mozambique: Definitive Census Results - Nampula |url=https://allafrica.com/stories/200911240886.html |access-date=2021-05-19 |website=allafrica.com}}</ref> it is the third-largest city in [[Mozambique]] after [[Maputo]] and [[Matola]]. The city is located in the interior of Nampula Province, approximately 200 kilometers from the coast and is surrounded by plains and rocky outcrops. The city is a major regional centre for the entire Northern region of Mozambique, as well as parts of Central Mozambique and border areas of [[Malawi]] and [[Tanzania]].<ref name="uclg">{{Cite web |url=https://www.uclg.org/sites/default/files/City_Profile_Nampula-Mozambique_en.pdf |website=www.uclg.org |access-date=2023-09-17 |title=Information about the City and Municipality of Nampula}}</ref> 

The city links the port city of [[Nacala]] with land-locked Southern African countries, particularly Malawi through a road and railway line. The city has a small international airport connecting to [[Nairobi]] in [[Kenya]], [[Johannesburg]] in [[South Africa]], [[Dar es Salaam|Dar-es-Salaam]] in Tanzania and is a hub for local transport in northern Mozambique. Nampula is the centre of business in Northern Mozambique,<ref name="uclg"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/crime-conflict-corruption-nampula/|title=Crime, conflict and corruption: Nampula as a smuggling hub }}</ref> benefitting from highly productive agricultural areas, proximity to the Nacala Development Corridor, and a fast-growing city population.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.citiesalliance.org/sites/default/files/Nampula.pdf |website=www.citiesalliance.org |access-date=2023-09-17 |title=Building Partnerships for Integrated City Planning in Nampula, Mozambique}}</ref> 

Nampula is home to the Mozambican National Ethnographic Museum, several [[Marketplace|markets]], [[cathedrals]], [[mosques]], [[universities]], training institutes and schools. The [[city]] is diverse, with the native [[Makhuwa language|eMakhuwa]] population being the largest group but with a visible Indian, European, Chinese, Lebanese, Somali, and Nigerian population.

== Etymology ==
The name "Nampula" is said to be derived to the eMakhuwa word "Whampula", which according to local legend refers to a tribal leader of the area in the past.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://cmnampula.gov.mz/cidade/ |website=cmnampula.gov.mz |access-date=2023-09-17 |title=Cidade |lang=pt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190312080632/https://cmnampula.gov.mz/cidade/ |archive-date=12 Mar 2019}}</ref> 

== History ==
Nampula is a relatively new city. It was founded by the Portuguese colonial army in 1907 and elevated to city status in 1956. During the [[Mozambican War of Independence]], Nampula was a strategic military centre for the colonial army in the fight against the [[FRELIMO]] liberation movement.<ref name="uclg"/>

After independence in 1975, the Portuguese abandoned Nampula and rural populations migrated to the city, squatting in unplanned areas on the city outskirts. This migratory movement dramatically increased during the [[Mozambican Civil War]], affecting Nampula in the decade between 1982 and 1992. When the war ended the [[Politics of Mozambique|Mozambican Government]] expected the refugees to return to the countryside, but they remained in the city. After a few years of migratory slow‐down, the growth of the city resumed, as the rapid economic development of Mozambique materialized mostly in the urban areas.<ref name="uclg"/> Nampula, in the post‐war period, developed into a major Mozambican growth centre, attracting an increasing number of public and private investments in a wide range of economic and social areas.<ref name="uclg"/> 
[[File:Mahamudo-Amurane.jpg|thumb|left|Mahamudo Amurane (left) was the Mayor of Nampula from 2014 to 2017. ]]
In colonial times there was a Nampula Town Hall with a very limited mandate which was dissolved in 1979. The Municipal Council of Nampula was created in 1998, alongside those of other major Mozambican cities. [[FRELIMO]] won the first local elections that year, and in the subsequent elections in 2003, 2008, and 2011. An opposition party, the [[Democratic Movement of Mozambique|Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM)]], won the 2013 municipal elections, led by Mahamudo Amurane.<ref name="amurane"/> Mayor Amurane was assassinated in October 2017, and investigations into his death proved to be inconclusive.<ref name="amurane">{{Cite web |url=https://assassination.globalinitiative.net/face/mahamudo-amurane/|title=Mahamudo Amurane }}</ref> Amurane's death led to a collapse of the MDM's support base in Nampula and another opposition party, [[RENAMO]], won subsequent municipal elections led by Paulo Vahanle. 

Since the establishment of the city, Nampula has had numerous mayors:{{cn|date=May 2021}}
* Aurélio das Neves

* Francisco Joaquim de Lima
* Narciso João Iondela
* Ishaca Abdul Ali Baraca

Of the graduates, 26 are now working in public hospitals. In addition, 10 have university teaching posts (five male and five female). Seven of the graduates have enrolled on postgraduate programmes (five male and seven female).<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019 |title=Addressing avoidable vision impairment in Mozambique and the Africa region |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327866746 |website=Development in Practice}}</ref>
