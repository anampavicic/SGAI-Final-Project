'''Chocó Department''' ({{IPA|es|tʃoˈko}}) is a [[departments of Colombia|department]] of the [[Pacific/Chocó natural region|Pacific region]] of [[Colombia]] known for hosting the largest [[African diaspora|Afro-Colombian]] population in the nation, and a large population of Amerindian and mixed African-Amerindian Colombians. It is in the west of the country, and is the only Colombian department to have [[coastline]]s on both the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It contains all of Colombia's border with [[Panama]]. Its capital is [[Quibdó]].

Chocó has a diverse geography, unique ecosystems and unexploited natural resources; however, its population has one of the lowest standards of living of all departments in Colombia. A major factor cited by the government is the rugged, montane rainforest environment and the hot, hyperhumid climate. These factors have limited any significant infrastructure improvements to the region, and Chocó remains one of the most isolated regions of Colombia, with no major transportation infrastructure built since initial foundations were laid down in 1967 for a highway connecting Chocó with the city of [[Medellín]].

The area has little access to medical care. In August 2016, Colombian media reported that some 50 children starved in less than three months, creating awareness of the grave condition Choco’s inhabitants are facing. That same year, an additional 10 adults and senior citizens, of the indigenous community in Chocó, died due to preventable causes such as malaria and diarrhea.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thecitypaperbogota.com/news/choco-goes-on-strike-to-force-government-action-on-healthcare-and-infrastructure |title= Chocó strikes to force government action on healthcare, infrastructure |author=Jared Wade |publisher=The City Paper - Bogotá |date=16 August 2016 |accessdate=30 September 2022}}</ref> In spite of the department’s ranking of “world's rainiest lowland” (the [[Chocó–Darién moist forests]] [[ecoregion]]), with close to {{convert|400|in|mm|sigfig=1}} of annual precipitation,<ref name="parsons">{{Citation

==History==
[[File:Vasco Núñez de Balboa (E. Pérez) 01.jpg|left|thumb|Monument to [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] in [[Madrid]], founder of Santa María la Antigua del Darién]]
The first city founded by conquistadors in mainland [[Americas|America]] was [[Santa María la Antigua del Darién]], founded by [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] in 1510 and disestablished in 1524, just 14 years later.
The department was created in 1944.<ref name="semana"/> Its low population, mountainous and inhospitable [[topography]], and distance from [[Bogotá]] resulted in Chocó receiving little attention from the Colombian government. During the reign of military dictator [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla]], his administration proposed to eliminate Chocó and divide its territory between the departments of [[Antioquia department|Antioquia]] and [[Valle del Cauca department|Valle del Cauca]]. But the 1957 ''[[coup d'état]]'' of General [[Gabriel París Gordillo]] overthrew Pinilla's government and ended such plans.

==Geography==
[[Image:Baudó-range-Colombia-USGS.png|thumb|right|200px|The '''Chocó Department''' is covered mostly by the [[Baudó Mountains]].]]

The Chocó Department makes up most of the ecoregion known as [[El Chocó]] that extends from [[Panama]] to [[Ecuador]].

The municipality of [[Lloró]] holds the record for the world’s highest average annual [[precipitation]], measured at {{convert|13,300|mm|in ft}} which makes it the wettest place in the world.<ref>[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/globalextremes.html#highpre NOAA Satellite and Information Service ''Global Measured Extremes of Temperature and Precipitation'']</ref> Three large rivers drain the Chocó Department, the [[Atrato River|Atrato]] (which runs north, with tributaries that also flow north), the [[San Juan River (Colombia)|San Juan]], and the [[Baudó River|Baudó]]. Each has many tributaries. The [[Baudó Mountains]] on the coast and the inland [[Cordillera Occidental (Colombia)|Cordillera Occidental]] are cut by low valleys, with an altitude less than 1,000 meters, that form most of the territory.  Most of the Chocó is thick [[rainforest]]. Much of the wood for Colombia's internal consumption is harvested from the Chocó, with a small percentage harvested for export.
Chocó Department produces the majority of Colombia's significant [[platinum]] output (28,359 ounces of platinum in 2011). Chocó is also Colombia's top [[gold]]-producing region (653,625 ounces in 2011). In the late 19th century, it attracted a variety of miners from many countries seeking to make their fortunes in gold.

== Biodiversity ==
The Chocó is a Key Biodiversity Area<ref>{{Cite web |title=KeyBiodiversityAreas.org |url=https://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/ |access-date=2023-11-25 |website=www.keybiodiversityareas.org}}</ref> ([[Key Biodiversity Area|KBA]]). According to the [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Program]], it contains the 'greatest plant biodiversity on the planet (and) twenty-five percent of the plant and bird species living in this region are [[Endemism|endemic]].'<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sustainable Development Success |url=https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/dsd_aofw_mg/mg_success_stories/csd8/SARD-11.htm |access-date=2023-11-25 |website=www.un.org}}</ref> Globally, Chocó is among 25 regions classified as priority biodiversity hotspots.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Salaman |first=Paul |date=2020-11-23 |title=Forests of the biogeographic region of Chocó in critical danger of disappearing |url=https://proaves.org/en/forests-of-the-biogeographic-region-of-choco-in-critical-danger-of-disappearing/ |access-date=2023-11-25 |website=Fundación ProAves - por la conservación en el país de las aves |language=en-US}}</ref> 

Threats to this rich biodiversity, despite the region's conservation priority status, are many. Approximately 80% of the forest has been converted to other uses, such as slash-and-burn and intensive agriculture, inappropriate and illegal logging, and cattle ranching.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tumbes-Chocó-Magdalena - Threats {{!}} CEPF |url=https://www.cepf.net/our-work/biodiversity-hotspots/tumbes-choco-magdalena/threats |access-date=2023-11-25 |website=www.cepf.net |language=en}}</ref>

Measuring the extent of biodiversity loss in Chocó thus far was previously difficult due to the remoteness of most of the region. However, with advances in LiDAR imaging and the efforts of various nonprofit conservation organizations, there is much documentation to identify and quantify the [[environmental degradation]] and biodiversity loss. 

For example, a 2019 analysis of more than 80,000 ha of LiDAR samples to quantify the vegetation structure, disturbance, and elevation in Chocó forests, a loss of more than 115 million tons of dry biomass, or 58 million tons of carbon was documented.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Meyer |first1=Victoria |last2=Saatchi |first2=Sassan |last3=Ferraz |first3=António |last4=Xu |first4=Liang |last5=Duque |first5=Alvaro |last6=García |first6=Mariano |last7=Chave |first7=Jérôme |date=2019-03-23 |title=Forest degradation and biomass loss along the Chocó region of Colombia |journal=Carbon Balance and Management |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=2 |doi=10.1186/s13021-019-0117-9 |issn=1750-0680 |pmc=6446973 |pmid=30904964 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

El Pangán ProAves Reserve, in the biogeographic region of Chocó, charged with protecting area's biodiversity, with special consideration of protecting bird species, is greatly challenged and not sufficiently equipped to meet the numerous conservation threats to a great diversity of fauna and flora that include 300 bird species. Forest degradation takes at least 50 years to regenerate, and regeneration efforts are not keeping pace with the rate of further deforestation. Soil erosion, negative effects on species' feeding and reproductive cycles, fragmentation of habitat, and loss of species are all consequences of this large-scale deforestation.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Salaman |first=Paul |date=2020-11-23 |title=Forests of the biogeographic region of Chocó in critical danger of disappearing |url=https://proaves.org/en/forests-of-the-biogeographic-region-of-choco-in-critical-danger-of-disappearing/ |access-date=2023-11-25 |website=Fundación ProAves - por la conservación en el país de las aves |language=en-US}}</ref>

The Chocó is inhabited predominantly by Afro-Colombians, descendants of enslaved Africans imported and brought to this area by the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonizers]] after conquering the [[Americas]]. The second largest race/ethnic group are the [[Embera-Wounaan|Embera]], a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] people. More than half of their total population in Colombia lives in Chocó, some 35,500. They practice hunting and [[artisan fishing]] and live near rivers.<ref name="elpais">{{cite news|title=86 tribus subsisten en Colombia |url=http://www.elpais.com.co/historico/mar232007/NAL/tribus.html |newspaper=El País |publisher=elpais.com |location=[[Cali]], Colombia |date=23 March 2007 |access-date=7 February 2010 |language=es |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927015340/http://www.elpais.com.co/historico/mar232007/NAL/tribus.html |archive-date=27 September 2007 }}</ref>

The total population as of 2005 was less than half a million, with more than half living in the [[Quibdó]] valley. According to a 2005 census<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dane.gov.co/files/censo2005/etnia/sys/visibilidad_estadistica_etnicos.pdf|title=La visibilización estadística de los grupos étnicos colombianos|language=es}}</ref> the ethnic composition of the department is:

* [[Black studies|Blacks]], [[Mulatto|Mulattos]] and [[Zambo|Zambos]] (82.1%)
* [[Amerindians]] or [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous]] (12.7%)
* [[Whites]], [[Castizo|Castizos]] and [[Mestizos]] (5.2%)

==Towns and municipalities==
[[Quibdó]] is the largest city, with a population of almost 100,000. Other important cities and towns include [[Istmina]], [[Condoto]], [[Alto Baudó]], [[Riosucio, Chocó|Riosucio]] and [[El Carmen de Atrato]] in the interior, [[Acandí]] on the Caribbean Coast, and [[Bahía Solano]] on the Pacific Coast.

Resorts and Tourist destinations include [[Capurganá]] on the Caribbean Coast, and [[Juradó]], [[Nuquí]], and Solano Bay on the West Coast.
