'''Daly City''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|eɪ|l|i}}) is the second most populous city in [[San Mateo County, California]], United States. Located in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and immediately south of [[San Francisco]] (sharing its northern border with almost all of San Francisco's southern border), it is named for businessman and landowner [[John Donald Daly]].

The population was 104,901 at the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]].<ref name="2020 Census (City)">{{cite web |title=Explore Census Data |url=https://data.census.gov/profile/Daly_City_city,_California?g=160XX00US0617918 |access-date=December 31, 2023 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]}}</ref> The [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|racial makeup]] of Daly City was 57.3% [[Asian Americans|Asian]], 11.7% non-Hispanic White and 23.1% Hispanic or Latino of any race in the 2020 census.<ref name="POP010220" /> Notably, 33.2% of the population of Daly City is Filipino.

As some of the refugees established homes in the area, the need for city services grew. This, combined with the fear of annexation by San Francisco and being ignored by San Mateo County, whose seat far to the south left residents feeling ignored, created a demand for incorporation. The first such attempt was proposed in 1908 for incorporation as the city of Vista Grande. Vista Grande would have spanned from the Pacific to the Bay, with San Francisco as its northern border and South San Francisco and the old Rancho Buri Buri as its southern border. The proposal was rejected over the scope of the planned city, which was too broad for many residents.<ref name="Chandler 79">{{Harv|Chandler|1973|p=79}}</ref> The initial proposal also revealed rifts in the community among the various regions, including the area around the cemeteries, who were excluded from further plans of incorporation.<ref name="Chandler 79" /> On January 16, 1911, an incorporation committee filed a petition with San Mateo County supervisors to incorporate the City of Daly City. The city would run from San Francisco along the San Bruno Hills until Price and School streets with San Francisco and west to the summit of the San Bruno Hills. The city would have an estimated population of 2,900.<ref name="Chandler 83">{{Harv|Chandler|1973|p=83}}</ref> On March 18, 1911, a special election was held, with incorporation narrowly succeeding by a vote of 132 to 130.<ref name="Chandler 84">{{Harv|Chandler|1973|p=84}}</ref>

It remained a relatively small community until the late 1940s, when developer [[Henry Doelger]] established [[Westlake, Daly City, California|Westlake]], a major district of homes and businesses, including the Westlake Shopping Center. Beginning in the 1950s Filipino Americans began to purchase homes east of  Junipero Serra Boulevard, as they were barred from the Westlake development due to [[Covenant (law)|racial covenants]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Stupi |first=Amanda |date=August 5, 2021 |title=In Daly City, the Bayanihan Spirit Is Alive and Well |url=https://www.kqed.org/news/11883382/in-daly-city-the-bayanihan-spirit-is-alive-and-well |work=KQED |location=San Francisco |access-date=January 22, 2022}}</ref> On March 22, 1957, Daly City was again the epicenter of [[1957 San Francisco earthquake|an earthquake]], this one a 5.3 [[Seismic scale|magnitude]] quake on the San Andreas Fault, which caused some structural damage in Westlake and closed [[California State Route 1|State Route 1]] along the Westlake Palisades.<ref name="USGS 1957 quake">{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/states/events/1957_03_22.php |title=Historic Earthquakes – 1957 March 22 19:44:21 UTC Magnitude 5.3 |access-date=July 6, 2009 |date=January 30, 2009 |work=Earthquake Hazards Program |publisher=[[US Geological Survey]] }}</ref> In 1963, Daly City annexed the city of [[Bayshore City, California|Bayshore]].<ref name="dalycity.org">{{Cite web|title=History|url=https://www.dalycity.org/392/History|url-status=live|access-date=March 21, 2021|website=City of Daly City Police|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210125210010/https://www.dalycity.org/392/History |archive-date=January 25, 2021 }}</ref> The [[Cow Palace]], located in Bayshore and now within the city limits of Daly City, was the site of [[1964 Republican National Convention|the following year's Republican National Convention]].
