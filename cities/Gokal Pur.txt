'''Gokal Pur''' also known as village gokalpur is a [[census town]] in [[North East Delhi|North East district]] in the [[India|Indian]] [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Delhi]]. Gokal Pur village is founded by a [[Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty|gujjar]] more than 900 years ago( exact time/date is not known). There were two Jindhad Gotra (Gurjar) brothers, one is Gokal and other is Johri. Gokal establish village [[Gokalpur Assembly constituency|Gokalpur]] and Johri established village Johripur. The present population majorly includes  [[Gurjar|Gurjars]], [[Pandit|Pandits]] [[Rajput|Rajputs]], [[Nai (caste)|Sain]] 

It was previously a village with cultivated land and few houses. But around 1967, the land was taken over by Land and Building department. The land than handed over to DDA (Delhi development authority). Wazirabad Road, [[Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar College|Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar college]], MIG and LIG flats, etc. are all on the land that Land and Building department acquired from the Gurjar and Rajput farmers of village gokalpur. Much to your surprise, the case against this acquisition of land (for a proper amount of acquisition and alternate land ) is still pending in court. The 4th generation of this village is still standing to fight for the case.
