==History==

[[File:Inaugurazione Littoria 001.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The inauguration of Littoria in 1932]]
Although the area was first settled by the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]], the modern city was founded by [[Benito Mussolini]] on 30 June 1932 as Littoria, named for the [[Fasces#Antiquity|fascio littorio]]. The city was inaugurated on 18 December of the same year. Littoria was populated with settlers coming mainly from [[Friuli]] and [[Veneto]], who formed the so-called Venetian-[[Pontine Marshes|Pontine]] community (today surviving only in some peripheral boroughs). The edifices and the monuments, mainly in [[Rationalism (architecture)|rationalist]] style, were designed by famous architects and artists such as [[Marcello Piacentini]], [[Angiolo Mazzoni]] and Duilio Cambellotti.

In 1934 it became a provincial capital and, after [[World War II]], renamed Latina in 1946. With the arrival of other people mostly from Lazio itself, the original Venetian-like dialect was increasingly substituted by a form of [[Romanesco dialect]].

The city coat of arms is a blue shield with a stylized drawing of the City Hall Clock Tower in the middle, standing on a field of green, and flanked by two stalks of [[wheat]] tied at the base with a red ribbon engraved with the motto ''LATINA OLIM PALUS'' ("Latina, once a swamp") in [[Latin]]. The shield is surmounted by a [[mural crown]].

==Economy==

The city has some [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]], [[chemical industry]] and a strong service sector. Latina is also an important centre for agriculture (vegetables, flowers, sugar, fruit, cheese and derivates).
