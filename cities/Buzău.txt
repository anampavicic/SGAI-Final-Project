The city of '''Buzău''' (formerly spelled ''Buzeu'' or ''Buzĕu''; {{IPA|ro|buˈzəw|-|Ro-Buzău.ogg}}) is the county seat of [[Buzău County]], Romania, in the historical region of [[Muntenia]]. It lies near the right bank of the [[Buzău River]], between the south-eastern curvature of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] and the lowlands of [[Bărăgan Plain]].

Buzău is a railway hub in south-eastern Romania, where railways that link Bucharest to Moldavia and Transylvania to the Black Sea coast meet. [[DN2]], a segment of [[European route E85]] crosses the city. Buzău's proximity to trade routes helped it develop its role as a commerce hub in older days, and as an industrial centre during the 20th century.

During the Middle Ages, Buzău was a [[market town]] and [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[episcopal see]] in [[Wallachia]]. It faced a period of repeated destruction during the 17th and 18th centuries, nowadays symbolized on the city seal by the [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix bird]]. In the 19th century, after the end of that era, the city began to recover. The economy underwent industrialization, Buzău became a railway hub, and public education became available. At this time, the Communal Palace, the city's landmark building, and Crâng Park, the main recreational area, were built. The communist regime after World War II brought forced industrialization and the tripling of the city's population. Some of the factories open at the time are still functioning within the framework of market economy.

There are no universities based in Buzău, and only a few universities from other cities have remote learning facilities here. The main educational institutions here are B.P. Hasdeu high-school (where Nobel laureate George Emil Palade studied) and Mihai Eminescu high-school. The city has a number of other secondary schools, in addition to elementary schools. The Vasile Voiculescu County Library and Buzău County Museum are based in the city. The latter also manages an ethnography exhibit in the city, as well as the Vasile Voiculescu memorial house in [[Pârscov]] and the amber exhibit at [[Colți]].

== Etymology ==
The city is named after [[Buzău (river)|the nearby river]]. In turn, the river is mentioned under the name {{lang|el|Μουσεος}} (''Mouseos'') in a document written in Greek and dated 376 AD, recounting the martyrdom of [[Sabbas the Goth]]. Historian [[Vasile Pârvan]] thought that this name is a Greek misspelling of the Thracian word ''Bouzeos'' (by losing a ''π'' from the ''Μπ'' group, which is pronounced like a Latin ''B''). He suggested that the name comes from the Thracian root ''Buzes'', with the addition of the  ''-eu'' suffix, a form of the Greek-Latin suffix ''-aios''.<ref>Petcu, p. 19</ref>

== History ==
{{Main|History of Buzău}}
[[File:Vue_de_la_ville_de_Bouzeou.jpg|left|thumb|Buzău in early 20th century]][[File:1916_-_Albert_Reich_-_Buzau,_palatul_administrativ_p55.jpg|left|thumb|German occupation troops, 1916]]The written history of the city begins with that of [[Țara Românească|Wallachia]]. It was certified as a market town and customs point during the reign of [[Dan II of Wallachia|Dan II]].<ref>Petcu, p. 20</ref> Archeological sites belonging to [[Gumelnița–Karanovo culture|Gumelnița]] and Monteoru cultures prove the presence of human inhabitants before the Christian era.<ref name="mjb_men_23_24">Buzău, mică enciclopedie istorică, pp. 23–24</ref> During the Middle Ages, there was also a fortress of Buzău, but only a few passing mentions in foreign documents are kept.<ref name="mjb_men_23_24" /> The market that was already flourishing in 1431, has also become an Orthodox episcopal see in the early 16th century.<ref>Petcu, p. 23</ref>

In the 17th century, an era of war and foreign invasions began, that affected the town and its surroundings. They began with [[Mihai Viteazul|Michael the Brave]]'s participation in the [[Long Turkish War]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Petcu|2002|pp=120}}</ref> and ended with the [[Wallachian uprising (1821)|Wallachian uprising of 1821]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Petcu|2002|p=35}}</ref> Natural disasters (epidemics, earthquakes) also took their toll, leading to destruction and depopulation of Buzău. However, the inhabitants always returned and rebuilt the city, which led early 18th century local authorities to use the [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix bird]] on the city seal, as a symbol of rebirth.<ref>Petcu, pp. 30–34</ref>

The 19th century brought a time of cultural and economical development.<ref>Petcu, pp. 123–124</ref> The [[Communal Palace, Buzău|Communal Palace]], the city's main landmark, was built at the time,<ref name="Petcu 2002 53">{{Harvnb|Petcu|2002|p=53}}</ref> after the city developed its industry and became a railway hub in the 1870s. Schools were open, such as the Theological Seminary în 1836, and the B. P. Hasdeu high school in 1867,<ref name="Petcu 2002 53" /> and theatre plays were produced (starting 1852):<ref>{{Harvnb|Petcu|2002|pp=43–44}}</ref> the "Moldavia" theatre house was built in 1898 and used throughout the first half of the 20th century as the main concert and theatre hall, where artists such as [[George Enescu]], [[C.

During [[Romania during World War I|World War I]], Buzău came under German occupation after mid-December 1916,<ref>{{YouTube|GYY8cNXQbFg|The Mesopotamian Front Awakens – Joseph Joffre Gets Sacked I THE GREAT WAR Week 125}}, ''The Great War'' by Indy Neidell. Time index 7:44.</ref> and many inhabitants took refuge in the nearby villages or in [[Western Moldavia]]. The city resumed its development after the war. The interbellum brought about the first sport matches (association football and boxing)<ref>{{Harvnb|Petcu|2002|pp=69,74}}</ref> and the "Metalurgica" factory,<ref name="Buzău p. 255">Buzău. Mică enciclopedie istorică, p. 255</ref> a private business that was to be later confiscated by the communists, and continues to this day as part of a joined venture.

After [[Romania in World War II|World War II]], the industrialization of Buzău was forcefully accelerated, and its population tripled in less than 50 years; new inhabitants were brought to work in newly built factories mainly in the south of the city.<ref name="primariabuzau.ro_2015-05-04">{{Citation|title=Primaria Municipiului Buzau|url=http://www.primariabuzau.ro/index.php?loc=municipiul_bz&id=59&show=1|newspaper=Primariabuzau.ro|access-date=4 May 2015}}</ref> Buzău has profoundly changed its appearance, working class quarters being built instead of the old commercial streets, some historical buildings,<ref name="Petcu 2002 94">{{Harvnb|Petcu|2002|p=94}}</ref> such as the Moldavia Theatre, were demolished. Their cultural role was taken over by the Labor Unions' Cultural Center and then by "Dacia" Cinema.<ref>{{Harvnb|Petcu|2002|p=90}}</ref>

In 2021, there was a project, known as "Buzău Mare 2021" ("Greater Buzău 2021"), that aimed to unite Buzău with the commune of [[Țintești]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-administratie_locala-24902094-buzau-buzaul-mare-comuna-tintesti-unire-autostrada-a7.htm|title=Buzăul Mare 2021: Municipiul Buzău vrea să-și dubleze suprafața prin alipirea unei comune adiacente / Viitoarea autostrada A7 ar urma să treacă prin mijlocul noii localități|newspaper=[[HotNews]]|date=6 July 2021|language=ro}}</ref> On 26 September 2021, a [[referendum]] was done to decide this, but as only 10.03% of the population of Buzău voted, which is below the legal threshold requiring a voter turnout of 30%, the results were considered null and Țintești and Buzău were left separate.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.g4media.ro/referendumul-pentru-alipirea-comunei-tintesti-la-buzau-a-esuat-doar-10-din-buzoieni-s-au-prezentat-la-urne.html|title=Referendumul pentru alipirea comunei Țintești la Buzău a eșuat: Doar 10% din buzoieni s-au prezentat la urne|newspaper=[[G4 Media (website)|G4 Media]]|date=27 September 2021|language=ro}}</ref>

Except for a few churches, it is the only building from the time of successive destructions of Buzău (17th and 18th centuries). It hosts the ethnography exhibit of the County Museum.]]
Eight historical monuments classified as having national importance exist in Buzău: the church of the Birth of Christ (1649, also known colloquially as the "Greeks' church" or the "Merchants' church") along with its belfry; the courthouse (20th century); the church of the Annunciation from the former Banu monastery (16th century); the church of the Dormition in Broșteni district, (1709, along with the belfry erected in 1914); the headquarters of the orthodox bishopric with the church of the Dormition (1649), the chapel (1841), the episcopal palace (17th century), the old seminary (1838), the chancellery (19th century), gate belfry and the compound wall (18th century); the Vergu-Mănăilă mansion (18th century, which currently hosts the ethnography exhibit of the County Museum); Vasile Voiculescu County Library (1914); and the Communal Palace (city hall, 1899–1903).<ref name="patrimoniu.gov.ro_2015-07-132" />

One public forum monument and twelve memorial monuments are included in the list of historical monuments in Buzău County with local importance, including the urban area of Cuza Vodă street (19th century) in the old town, [[Crâng park]], the Albatros Villa (that used to belong to [[Alexandru Marghiloman]]) and the park, the Jewish temple, the buildings of [[Colegiul Național B.P. Hasdeu|B.P. Hasdeu]] and [[Mihai Eminescu National College (Buzău)|Mihai Eminescu]] high-schools, a house where [[Hortensia Papadat-Bengescu]] lived for a few years, and some of the tombs in Dumbrava cemetery, such as one that was originally decorated with the statue "Prayer" by [[Constantin Brâncuși]] (nowadays replaced by a replica).<ref name="patrimoniu.gov.ro_2015-07-132">{{Citation|title=List of historical monuments in Buzău|url=http://patrimoniu.gov.ro/images/LMI/LMI-2010_BZ.pdf|newspaper=Patrimoniu.gov.ro|access-date=13 July 2015}}</ref>{{clearright}}

==Geography==
The city is located in the center of the county, 100&nbsp;km north-east of [[București|Bucharest]], in the south-east of Romania, taking up a total area of {{cvt|81.3|km2}}, at the outermost curvature of the Subcarpathian foothills, at the crossroads of the three main Romanian historical provinces: [[Wallachia]], [[Transylvania]], and [[Moldavia]]. It is entirely placed on the right bank of [[Buzău (river)|Buzău river]], which forms its northern limit. The shape of the city is oblong, longer along the river and shorter across. It reaches altitudes of 101 meters in the north-west, near the foothills, going down to 88 meters on the riverbank, while the average altitude of 95 meters is the same as the altitude of Dacia square, in the city center.<ref name="relief2">Petcu, pp. 102–103</ref> Thus, Buzău is placed in a flat area, with a height difference of just 10 meters along a 4-kilometer line.<ref name="relief2" />

=== Waterways ===
[[Buzău (river)|Buzău river]] is the northern limit of the city. This river has created an underground basin that it permanently fuels with water.<ref>Strategia Buzău 2014–2020, p. 15</ref> These underground waters are a main source of drinking water, and their excess overflows to a marshy wetland south of the city, in the neighboring communes [[Costești, Buzău|Costești]], [[Stâlpu]], and [[Țintești]], with small but steady [[River source|springs]], that ultimately form the [[Călmățui River (Brăila)|Călmățui river]].<ref>Planul Urbanistic General, pagina 6</ref>

===Climate===
Annual rainfall is circa 500&nbsp;mm<ref name="clima2">Petcu, pp.104–105</ref> and in winter the snow cover can be as high as 30&nbsp;cm.<ref name="clima2" /> The Buzău River has a fluctuating flow. Especially in spring, when it collects melted snow from the mountain area, its level rises. The city was, however, built away from its deep and wide valley, so the river never floods the city. Even at the major floods of 2005, the waters caused no problem in the city proper, but it seriously damaged both bridges across it located in the city,<ref name="jurnalul2005-05-10">{{Cite news|title=Podul de la Mărăcineni – Moldova, ruptă de Muntenia|date=10 May 2005|url=http://jurnalul.ro/stiri/observator/podul-de-la-maracineni-moldova-rupta-de-muntenia-45374.html|author=Costisitor.

The climate is [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]], classified as ''Dfa'' in [[Köppen climate classification]] and as ''Dc'' in [[Trewartha climate classification]], with an average 92&nbsp;freezing days a year (16 with temperatures below −10&nbsp;°C), but also with 92&nbsp;days of hot summer.<ref name="clima2" /> and 25.8 days with snow depth over {{Convert|1|cm|inches|abbr=on}}.<ref name="WMONormals"/> Local winds include the [[Crivăț (vânt)|Crivăț]], a cold north-easterly and sometimes easterly wind in winter, and the [[Austru]], a south-westerly wind that brings dry air in summer and leads to warmer days in winter.<ref>Județele României Socialiste, p. 161</ref>

=== Ethnic communities ===
The main ethnic minority in the city are the [[Romani people of Romania|Roma]]. Throughout history, other communities have existed in Buzău, but nowadays they are nearly extinct. Those that left their mark the most on the city were the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish people]] and the [[Bulgarians in Romania|Bulgarians]].

==== Roma ====
Settled after the 16th century by the Orthodox bishopric on its estate located north-west of the market town of Buzău, in Simileasca and Iorguleasca villages, Roma people have lived as [[Slavery in Romania|slaves]] who worked on the bishopric's land.<ref name="Lahovari_Sim">{{cite book|title=Simileasca (Iorguleasca), com. rur.|volume=5|page=389}}</ref> After they were freed in the 19th century and, with the union between Wallachia and Moldavia, the new country got a new territorial division, Simileasca became a commune. In 1968, this commune was dissolved and integrated with Buzău. The Roma community is still located mostly in this part of the city, and it preserves its identity, although its leaders believe that Roma people in other parts of the city, who no longer speak their people's language, accept assimilation by the majority Romanians, and declare themselves Romanian at the census.<ref name="stradadebuzau.ro_2015-04-28">{{Citation|title=Țiganii din Simileasca n-au nicio jenă să-și declare etnia – Strada de Buzau|url=http://www.stradadebuzau.ro/tiganii-din-simileasca-n-au-nicio-jena-sa-si-declare-etnia/|author=Corina Răchițeanu|newspaper=Stradadebuzau.ro|access-date=28 April 2015}}</ref> The community is faced with endemic poverty, high illiteracy, lack of professional qualifications and high school dropout rates, which all expose it to permanently being manipulated by politicians for elections.<ref name="jurnalul2015-04-28">{{Citation|title=Tiganii din Simileasca asteapta Marea Chefuiala|date=24 May 2004|url=http://jurnalul.ro/special-jurnalul/tiganii-din-simileasca-asteapta-marea-chefuiala-68413.html|author=Tatiana Dabija|newspaper=Jurnalul Național|access-date=28 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305141141/http://jurnalul.ro/special-jurnalul/tiganii-din-simileasca-asteapta-marea-chefuiala-68413.html|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Many Roma people went abroad, especially in the countries of Northern Europe.<ref name="adev2015-04-28">{{Citation|title=Norvegienii finanțează proiecte de îmbunătățire a vieții romilor din Buzău|date=7 February 2014|url=http://adevarul.ro/locale/buzau/norvegienii-finanteaza-proiecte-imbunatatire-vietii-romilor-buzau-1_52f53da8c7b855ff5628bb51/index.html|author=Iulian Bunila|newspaper=Adevărul|access-date=28 April 2015}}</ref><ref name="ziaristionline.ro_2015-04-28">{{Citation|title=Țiganii pe care nu-i vede Mircea Toma.

==== Jews ====
[[File:RO_BZ_Jewish_temple_2.jpg|right|thumb|The Jewish synagogue in Buzău]]
Although mentioned in documents as early as the 16th century, the [[Jews]] of Buzău became an especially important community starting with the cultural and economical development period of the 19th century. A large proportion of them were merchants and craftsmen. The Jewish cemetery appeared in 1853 and a temple dates from 1885. Between the two World Wars, 10% of the population of Buzău was Jewish,<ref name="adev2013-04-11">{{Citation|title=VIDEO Cimitirul evreiesc din Buzău, un ansamblu monumental ruinat de trecera timpului și nepăsarea oamenilor|date=11 April 2013|url=http://adevarul.ro/locale/buzau/buzau-cimitir-evrei-1_5166524600f5182b85a74909/index.html|author=Iulian Bunila|newspaper=Adevărul|access-date=28 April 2015}}</ref> a large percentage compared to other cities in Wallachia, but significantly smaller than those in Moldavia, which saved the community from the brunt of the [[Ion Antonescu#Antonescu and the Holocaust|repression by Antonescu's government]]. Still, during [[World War II]], the Jews had to endure some persecutions: obligated to do compulsory work (authorities abused of the law, and extended the age of the people who had to do this work, as well as the body of the work itself), and to pay 15 million lei (four times the tax) for "The Reunification Loan"; certain types of objects were confiscated from them and special restrictions were imposed. The community had to host orphans whose parents were murdered in [[Holocaust|the Holocaust]], before they were deported to [[Transnistria Governorate|Transnistria]].<ref name="doctorat_maracineanu">{{Cite web|url=http://www.unibuc.ro/studies/Doctorate2013Mai/MARACINEANU%20LAURA%20-%20COMUNITATEA%20EVREIASCA%20DE%20LA%20BUZAU%20IN%20TIMPUL%20CELUI%20DE%20AL%20DOILEA%20RAZBOI%20MONDIAL/rezumat%20maracineanu.doc|title=Comunitatea evreiască de la Buzău în timpul celui de al Doilea Război Mondial|first1=Mirela-Laura|last1=Mărăcineanu|first2=Ion (coordonator)|last2=Bulei|publisher=Facultatea de Istorie, [[Universitatea din București]]|year=2012}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (rezumat)</ref> During these persecutions, the Jewish community was defended by captains Stroie and Ionescu, by the Scânteie and Stahu families,<ref name="romanianjewish.org_2015-04-28" /> and by [[Anghel Anuțoiu]] from Vrancea, a man who informed members of the community of upcoming Nazi raids, saving many lives, including that of Rabbi Simon Bercovich, whom he aided to leave the city and go into hiding.<ref name="evz2015-04-28">{{Citation|title=Lista lui bădița Anghel, salvatorul de evrei|date=11 January 2008|url=http://www.evz.ro/lista-lui-badita-anghel-salvatorul-de-evrei-2886.html|newspaper=Evenimentul zilei|access-date=28 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?language=en&itemId=4044236|title=Anuțoiu, Anghel T.|publisher=Yad Vashem, baza de date a drepților între popoare|access-date=15 May 2015}}</ref> After the war, most Jews of the city moved to Israel, and left behind a Jewish community of only a few tens of people.

==== Bulgarians ("Serbs") ====
In the 18th century, to avoid [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] repression against Christians in the Balkans, groups of Bulgarians settled in [[Țara Românească|Wallachia]] where they enjoyed freedom to practice Christianity; some of these groups came to Buzău. The locals called them "Serbs" as a generic term for South-Slavs. The new immigrants soon started developing [[Olericulture|vegetable gardens]] as their houses were in the vicinity of the river that provided them with plenty of water, while local farmers were focusing more on raising livestock and growing cereals. Although the Bulgarian community was in time assimilated by the Romanians, to this day locals use the word "Serb" as a synonym to "one who grows vegetables".<ref name="bulgari">{{Harvnb|Petcu|2002|pp=27–34}}</ref>

== Government ==
Buzău is administered by a mayor and a local council consisting of 23 councillors. The mayor, Constantin Toma, of the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD), has been in office since 2016.<ref name="hotnews.ro_2016-10-27">{{Citation|url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-politic-21056696-rezultate-alegeri-locale-2016-buzau-constantin-toma-psd.htm|title=Industriașul Constantin Toma (PSD) a câștigat primăria Buzău – Politic| newspaper=HotNews.ro|date= 6 June 2016|author=Red.

Buzău is not subdivided into any lower units, but local authorities guide their projects and strategies according to an informal division by districts. In ''Strategia 2014–2020'', a strategical document of the mayor's office, the following districts of Buzău were identified: Center, Micro 12/Indepenedenței, Marghiloman, Dorobanți, Nicolae Bălcescu, Simileasca, Micro 14, Poștă, Mihai Viteazul, Pod Horticolei, Luceafărul, Broșteni and the Industrial Zone.<ref>Strategia Buzău 2014–2020, pp. 87–98</ref>

==Economy==

=== Economic history ===
During the Middle Ages, Buzău's economy was based on trade, as the market town began as a customs and exchange point, and developed due to its position at the curvature of the Carpathians, in a place where roads that connected Wallachia to [[Moldova|Moldavia]] and [[Transilvania|Transylvania]] met. The old market town tradition is still preserved in the ''Drăgaica'' fair, held every June around [[Midsummer]], bringing together small producers and merchants from diverse regions of Romania.

The agricultural reform during [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] led some of the Bulgarian gardeners to rent in 1897 și 1898 some land acquired by the state from the bishopric. The developed a distribution network for their produce both in Buzău, and in other nearby cities such as [[Brașov]], [[Ploiești]], or [[Râmnicu Sărat]]. Their activity became even more lucrative after the land reform of 1921.<ref>Petcu, 2002, p. 134</ref>

After the period of repeated invasions and destruction ended in the 19th century, the economy began to industrialize as well. Towards the end of that century, the development of a Romanian railway network made Buzău one of its important hubs and pushed the small craftsmen's shops to evolve into industrial installations. The first such facility was the ''Garoflid mill'', open in 1883, that worked also as a [[Textile|cloth]] factory.<ref name="petcu1353">Petcu, 2002, p. 135</ref> În 1894, an [[Petrol|oil]] refinery of the ''Saturn'' society was built; this refinery was to function for 50 years.

After a dramatic nationwide decrease caused by the [[First World War]] (the 1919 output was a quarter of the one in 1913<ref name="petcu1353" />), the industrial development picked up steam during the interbellum. One of the main components of the local industry was [[Mill (grinding)|milling]]. The first industrial mill in the city, ''Garoflid'', renamed ''Zangopol'' after its new owner, had reached a capital of 5 million [[Romanian leu|lei]] in 1928 and, 30 de million in 1938, while the company that operated it had around 100 employees.<ref name="petcu1363">Petcu, 2002, p. 136</ref> Another business started at this time was ''Metalurgica și Turnătorie – S.A.'' (Metallurgy and Foundry), founded in 1928 with a capital of over 9 million lei. Although it had an initially difficult period, as it was closed during the [[Great Depression]], it was reopened in 1933, only to be closed again in 1940 and 1944, during World War II.<ref name="Buzău p. 255" />
[[File:1970_Intreprinderea_de_geamuri_Buzau.JPG|left|thumb|Buzău window factory in 1970]]
After [[World War II]], on 11 June 1948 all factories were requisitioned by the Communist government, who also began a program of forced industrialization, even though some of the industries that were being developed were unfit to the region.<ref name="petcu1373">Petcu, 2002, p. 137</ref> In 1965, the 318 [[Hectare|ha]] Buzău South industrial platform began to be built around the old location of the ''Saturn'' refinery, blown up during the war. It was the location of the city's most important factories that were developed at the time: the Steel Wire and Steel Wire Products Enterprise (after 1990, ''Ductil''), the Railway Machinery Enterprise (after 1990, ''[[VAE Apcarom|Apcarom]]''), ''Metalurgica'' (the one founded in 1928), the Glass and Windows Factory (after 1991, ''[[Gerom Buzău|Gerom S.A.]]'').
[[File:RO_BZ_Contactoare.jpg|right|thumb|The "Contactoare" electrical relays factory in Buzău]]
Other facilities were located in other parts of the city, such as the Contactors Enterprise, in the north-east, and the Plastic Works (after 1990, ''[[Romcarbon|Romcarbon S.A.]]'') in the north.

Despite the forced industrialization, Buzău was spared from becoming dependent on a single industry, and there was no single point of failure for the city's economy. According to the new law of commerce of 1990, that came after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|fall of Communism]], these factories were organised as state-owned companies, and were privatised. Most of them survived the transition to a [[market economy]], as many of them thus became viable.

=== Present economy ===
Currently, the largest Buzău-based company is Romet, a [[holding company]] made up of multiple firms that produse isolation materials for water and gas pipes, water filters, fire extinguishers and other related products. It was successful in the 1990s, with the ''Aquator'' home water purifier. In 1999, it also acquired ''Aromet S.A.'', the company that operated the 1928 ''Metalurgica'' factory.<ref>Petcu, p. 141</ref>
[[File:Buzau_ductil.jpg|left|thumb|240x240px|Ductil steel wire factory]]
Other Buzău-based companies were privatised by programs supervised by the [[World Bank]]. [[VAE Apcarom|''Apcarom S.A.'']], the only Romanian producer of railway equipments,<ref name="petcu1382">Petcu, 2002, p. 138</ref> was acquired by the Austrian company VAE, and in 2008 had a capital of 7.38&nbsp;million lei.<ref name="curierulnational.ro_2006-07-31">{{Citation|title=Profit in scadere pentru Apcarom|date=31 July 2006|url=http://www.curierulnational.ro/Economie/2006-07-31/Profit+in+scadere+pentru+Apcarom|newspaper=Curierul Național|access-date=18 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212053/http://www.curierulnational.ro/Economie/2006-07-31/Profit+in+scadere+pentru+Apcarom|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Ductil S.A.'', one of the largest companies in the city, was privatised in 1999 and divided subsequently, during 1999–2000 by the new majority shareholder, FRO Spa, who only kept the electrodes and welding equipment facilities, and sold out the others.

The economy is still more oriented towards industry rather than services, which, according to a 2016 survey of the World Bank, made it more attractive to the labor force of lower qualification (at best with a high school degree). The same survey showed that most of the labor force in the city came from within the county, as Buzău is the center of a highly rural, compact and densely populated area. The city was found to be in competition with larger cities for the labor force from other counties, a feature it shares with [[Alexandria, Romania|Alexandria]]. The proximity of Bucharest makes Buzău itself a source of internal migration, thus orbiting the capital city. Buzău is the second city (closely after [[Ploiești]], a city with almost double the population), by the number of employees in Bucharest coming from other cities between 1991 and 2011; the survey points out that this has been a disadvantage, but might become an opportunity in the future.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/448771499322731333/pdf/116400-ROMANIAN-REVISED-PUBLIC-Magnet-Cities-Migration-and-Commuting-in-Romania-RO.pdf |title=Orașe-magnet.

Buzău is one of the main hubs of [[Romanian Railways]], as it connects [[Bucharest]] and [[Ploiești]] with [[Focșani]], [[Galați]] and [[Constanța]]. The city railway station was open in 1872, along with the Bucharest-Galați railway.<ref name="hotnews.ro_2014-03-14">{{Citation | url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-16807977-analiza-cum-mergeau-trenurile-acum-140-ani-poveste-romani-unguri-austrieci-englezi-vremuri-scandaluri-rasunatoare-reusite-uimitoare.htm| title=ANALIZA Cum mergeau trenurile acum 140 de ani - O poveste cu romani, unguri, austrieci si englezi in vremuri cu scandaluri rasunatoare si reusite uimitoare - Esential| newspaper=HotNews.ro| date= 2014-03-13| author=Vlad Barza| access-date=2015-06-02}}</ref>

===Road===
Buzău is crossed by national road [[DN2]] (part of [[European route E85]]), which connects the city to [[Bucharest]] to the south and to [[Râmnicu Sărat]] and the main cities of [[Western Moldavia]] to the north. National road [[DN1B]] (European Route E577) branches out of DN2 in Buzău. This road connects the city to [[Ploiești]]. In the north of the city, [[DN10]] also branches from DN2. It crosses the Carpathians at their south-eastern curvature through [[Buzău Pass]] towards [[Brașov]]. The south of Buzău is also crossed by national road DN2B, which branches from DN2 în the neighboring commune of Costești, leading eastward to [[Galați]] and [[Brăila]]. In Buzău, county road DJ203D branches from DN2B. It leads south to [[Țintești]] and [[Smeeni]], where it ends in {{ill|DN2C|ro}}, a road along which it helps connect Buzău to [[Slobozia]].<ref>{{Google maps|access-date=2015-04-28|url=https://www.google.ro/maps/@45.1446317,26.8161519,13z}}</ref>

In the Buzău city area, the only functional road bridge over Buzău River is the one crossing with DN2 to [[Mărăcineni, Buzău|Mărăcineni]]. There is another road bridge, connecting the city to [[Vadu Pașii]], near the railway bridge. It was however closed after it was destroyed by a flash flood in 2005, and repairs kept being postponed, which had an impact on the economy of the neighboring communes in the north-east of the city, as it remains used only by pedestrians and cyclists.<ref name="adev2015-06-02">{{Citation | url=http://adevarul.ro/locale/buzau/maternitatea-noua-podul-vadu-pasii-principalii-agenti-electorali-buzaului-1_5475895ba0eb96501e186dde/index.html| title=Maternitatea nouă și Podul Vadu Pașii, principalii agenți electorali ai Buzăului| newspaper=[[Adevărul]]| date= 26 November 2014| author=Iulian Bunila| access-date=2 June 2015}}</ref><ref name="stiri.tvr.ro_2015-06-02">{{Citation | url=http://stiri.tvr.ro/podul-de-la-vadu-pasii-proiectat-de-anghel-saligny-e-inchis-traficului-auto_52467.html| title=Podul de la Vadu Pașii, proiectat de Anghel Saligny, e închis traficului auto| newspaper=Stiri.tvr.ro| access-date=2 June 2015}}</ref> Works began in the fall of 2017.<ref name="adev2017-09-04">{{Citation | url=https://adevarul.ro/locale/buzau/au-inceput-lucrarile-podul-vadu-pasii-marti-interzis-accesul-pietonilor-1_59ad7a7a5ab6550cb8a0ee48/index.html| title=Au început lucrările la podul de la Vadu Pașii.

==Education and culture==
[[File:RO BZ County library.jpg|thumb|The ''Vasile Voiculescu'' memorial county library in Buzău]]

The first school in Buzău was the school for church and icon painters, opened by [[Chesarie Căpățână]], the bishop of Buzău. The school functioned at the bishopric of Buzău, and was managed by [[Nicolae Teodorescu]]. [[Gheorghe Tattarescu]] started learning painting here.

The city's most important educational landmark is the [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu National College|''Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu'' National College]], attended by the Nobel prize winner [[George Emil Palade]] in his youth. The ''Hasdeu'' high school was inaugurated in 1867.

The city's public library was opened in 1893, under the name of ''[[Carol I]] Public Library''. Later it took the name of [[Vasile Voiculescu]], Buzău's most prominent author, writer, and poet.

[[File:Colti amber museum.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Buzău County Museum]]

The ''George Ciprian'' stage theatre was created in 1996. It does not have an acting crew of its own, relying on contracts. Its first manager was playwright [[Paul Ioachim]].

The first university in the city was the Economic University College, inaugurated in 1992, a branch of the [[Academy of Economic Studies]] in [[Bucharest]].

The main museum in Buzău is the ''Buzău County Museum'', which exhibits items related to the region's history. The same museum oversees the [[ethnography]] exhibition at the [[Vergu-Mănăilă House]], as well as the ''[[Amber]] Museum'' in [[Colți]] and the ''Vasile Voiculescu Memorial House'' in [[Pârscov]].

The coat of arms of Buzău is the [[heraldic]] symbol standing for the city of Buzău, Romania. The city's first recorded coat of arms dates back to 1831, and since then, the coat of arms has mostly kept its features, under different designs.

===Description and symbolism===
The shield is parted by a wavy azure fess. The upper half further parted per pale. In the right quarter, on azure, there is the image of the city's Communal Palace standing on a vert terrace. In the left corner, on gules, a [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]] and a [[sword]], argent, crossed, with an or crown on top. The lower half shows, on argent, a [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix bird]], sable, rising from a gules bonfire.

The bludgeon and sword stand for the battles that have taken place around the city, throughout history, and the Phoenix (symbol of rebirth) symbolizes the repeated reconstruction undergone by Buzău during the early modern times, as the city was destroyed by war and natural disasters, and depopulated by epidemics.

The shield is topped by a [[mural crown]] with seven towers, which shows the city's status as a county seat.

[[Image:Historical Buzau CoA 1831.png|thumb|left|200x200px|The first recorded coat of arms of Buzău, 1831]]

===History===
The first seal of Buzău dates back to the year 1831 and shows a Phoenix bird and a church. The church stood for the bishopric based in Buzău, while the Phoenix bird stood for the periods of destruction and subsequent reconstruction that the city had recently undergone.

The Communal Palace, inaugurated in 1901, became a symbol of the city and eventually made its way on the official coat of arms. Thus, the inter-war coat of arms of Buzău is similar to the present one, except for the mural crown which only had five towers, and a golden border on the shield.

[[Image:RSR Mun Buzau.png|thumb|right|200x200px|Coat of arms of Buzău, 1970-1989]]
After [[World War II]], no symbol was used until 1970, when the [[Communist Romania|communist government]] adopted a set of new insignia for the Romanian cities. The 1970 coat of arms was divided party per fess, with an inescutcheon divided party per pale and charged with the crest of Communist Romania (hammer and sickle symbol of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] on red, dexter; flag of Romania, sinister). The upper half was divided party per pale, azure and gules, with an argent Communal Palace on the right quarter, and industrial towers on the left quarter. The lower half retained the sable Phoenix rising from the gules bonfire, which had, by then, become the main symbol of Buzău.

After the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], the Communist symbol was abolished and, again, the city was left without a coat of arms until 2006, when the present coat of arms was approved by the Romanian government.
