== History ==

Along with much of present-day coastal Andhra Pradesh, Bhimavaram was controlled by the [[Chola dynasty]]. Under [[Kulothunga Chola I]], Bhimavaram was ruled by his sons who served as viceroys. Stone inscriptions have been found in the town dating from his reign ({{Circa|1096 C.E.}}).<ref name="About">{{cite web|url=http://www.bhimavaraminfo.com/municipality.html|title=About Bhimavaram Municipality.|year=2011|publisher=Bhimavaram Municipal Corporation|access-date=23 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714160906/http://www.bhimavaraminfo.com/municipality.html|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Etymology ==

The name Bhimavaram literally means "the gift of Bhima". According to a legend, in around 890–918 AD, an [[Eastern Chalukyas|Eastern Chalukya]] king named Chalukya Bheema built a [[Shiva|Siva]] temple and laid the foundation to this town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhimavaraminfo.com/about-bhimavaram.html|title=Welcome to Bhimavaram Info|work=bhimavaraminfo.com|access-date=12 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706221432/http://www.bhimavaraminfo.com/about-bhimavaram.html|archive-date=6 July 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was originally called "Bhimapuram", but the name gradually changed to "Bhimavaram"; "puram" refers to a dwelling place while "varam" means an endowment in Telugu.
An alternative explanation is, that the sound va (labiodental) is preferred to ba, pa (labials) in colloquial language and over a period of time tend to shift from pa to va. Hence "varam" from "puram".
