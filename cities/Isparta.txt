'''Isparta''' is a city in western [[Turkey]]. It is the seat of [[Isparta Province]] and [[Isparta District]].<ref name=il>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx İl Belediyesi], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory. Retrieved 1 March 2023.</ref> Its population is 247,580 (2022).<ref name=tuik>{{Cite web |title=Address-based population registration system (ADNKS) results dated 31 December 2022, Favorite Reports|url=https://biruni.tuik.gov.tr/medas/?kn=95&locale=en |access-date=13 March 2023|publisher=[[TÜİK]]|language=en|format=XLS}}</ref> Its elevation is 1035 m. It is known as the "City of Roses".
Isparta is well-connected to other parts of Turkey via roads. [[Antalya]] lies 130&nbsp;km to the south and [[Eskişehir]] is 350&nbsp;km to the north.
[[Süleyman Demirel University]] has introduced thousands of youths from varied backgrounds to the city's mostly conservative fabric in recent years. The city's [[Association football|football]] team, [[Ispartaspor]], plays in Group 7 of the [[Turkish Regional Amateur League]].
== History ==
[[File:Isparta_museum_Men_a_local_god_2810.jpg|thumb| Men, the local god. Statue in Hellenistic style, Roman period, +/- 2nd century AD in [[Isparta Museum]]]]
===Roman era===
Isparta is a Turkish spelling of Greek ''Sparta'', by [[Prothesis (linguistics)|prothesis]] de[[Consonant cluster|clustering]].<ref>Studies in Etymology and Etiology: With Emphasis on Germanic, Jewish, Romance and Slavic Languages, page 316, by David L. Gold</ref>
Isparta was said to correspond to the ancient city of [[Baris (Pisidia)|Baris]], which is a namesake and was part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Pisidia]].<ref>Encyclopaedia of Islam, First Edition (1913-1936), section "Isparta", Mordtmann, J. H.</ref> A later theory has it instead as the Eastern Roman fortress '''Saporda'''; in Muslim sources it appears as Sabarta.<ref>Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, section "Isparta", Flemming, B.</ref> GE Bean characterized the situation thus: "These perpetually shifting conceptions leave the reader quite bewildered."<ref>Anatolian Studies. Volume 9. 1959. Notes and Inscriptions from Pisidia, Part 1, page 74, by G. E. Bean</ref> Modern scholars locate Baris near [[Kılıç, Keçiborlu|Kılıç]], in [[Keçiborlu]] district, Isparta province.<ref>{{Cite Barrington|65}}</ref><ref>{{Cite DARE|27713}}</ref>
At an early stage it became a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[bishopric]], a [[suffragan]] of the [[Metropolitan see]] of [[Antioch of Pisidia]], the capital of the province. The names of two of its [[bishop]]s are known with certainty: Heraclius participated in the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 and Leo in the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787. In addition, Paulus was at the [[Council of Constantinople (869)]] and Stephanus was at the [[Council of Constantinople (879)]], but one or both of these may have been of the Baris in the Roman province of Hellespontus.<ref>Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0agp0mJFG_sC ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. I, coll. 1049–1050</ref><ref>Raymond Janin, v. ''2. Baris'', in [http://booksnow.scholarsportal.info/ebooks/oca2/4/dictionnairedhis06bauduoft/dictionnairedhis06bauduoft.pdf ''Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de Géographie ecclésiastiques''], vol. VI, 1932, col. 808</ref> Like most sees in Asia Minor, it faded away.

*1071: Conquered by the [[Seljuk Turks]].
*Late 13th century: Becomes part of the [[Hamidids]].
*1381: Isparta is sold to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultan [[Murad I]] by the Hamidid Emir.
*Late 19th century: Muslim refugees from the [[Balkans]] settle around Isparta. The Bulgarian refugees brought the knowledge of [[kazanlik]] rosewater production with them, leading to Isparta's nickname: city of roses.
*1914: According to the [[1914 population statistics for the Ottoman Empire|1914 Ottoman population statistics]], the district of Isparta had a total population of 54.465, consisting of 46.698 Muslims, 6.648 [[Ottoman Greeks|Greeks]] and 1.119 [[Armenians in the Ottoman Empire|Armenians]].<ref>[[Kemal Karpat]] (1985), [https://kupdf.net/downloadFile/59e4a7b908bbc56144e653d7 Ottoman Population, 1830-1914, Demographic and Social Characteristics], [[The University of Wisconsin Press]], p. 180-181</ref>
*1923: The [[Greeks|Greek]] inhabitants of the area were forced to move to [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] under the [[Greco-Turkish population exchange]].
===Notable flight crashes===
On 19 September 1976, [[Turkish Airlines Flight 452]], a Boeing 727 aircraft, crashed on a hill in Isparta, also known Mount Karatepe, killing all 154 passengers and crew.
On 30 November 2007, [[Atlasjet Flight 4203]] crashed on approach to [[Isparta Süleyman Demirel Airport]], killing all 57 passengers and crew.
==Titular see==
No longer a residential bishopric, 'Baris in Pisidia' is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular bishopric]], nominal suffragan of [[Nicomedia]],<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 847</ref> since the diocese was nominally restored in 1933: Latin adjective Baren(us) in Pisidia (Latin).

The main economic activities of Isparta are the production of [[rosewater]] and handmade carpets. Tourism, both local and increasingly international due to "[[pilgrimage|biblical tourism]]", is becoming an important source of revenue.
In the early 20th century, [[Turkish carpets|carpetmaking]] was a major industry in Isparta.<ref name=Prothero110>{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G. W.|title=Anatolia|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office |location=London |page=110 |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11766/view/1/110/}}</ref>
== Climate ==
Isparta has a [[Hot-summer mediterranean climate|Hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Csa''), or a [[temperate continental climate]] ([[Trewartha climate classification]]: ''Dc''). Winters are chilly, rainy and often snowy, summers are hot and dry. The lakes around the city have an important moderating influence on the climate. Precipitation occurs mostly in the winter months, with a notable decrease in summer.

== Sights ==
The city lies close to a fault line and is thus prone to violent [[earthquake]]s.
Most of the ancient city was destroyed by an earthquake 1914. So there are only a few historical buildings left. The oldest building is the ''Kutlu Bey Mosque'' (or ''Ulu Camii'', which means great Mosque), built in 1429 by Kutlu Bey, a general of Sultan [[Murad II]]. It was very badly destroyed by the earthquake 1914, but restored 1922.
Famous is the ''Firdevs-Bey-Camii'' (Mosque) (also: ''Firdevs Paşa Camii'', ''Mimar Sinan Camii'') from 1561. The mosque and the neighboring ''Bedesten'' (market hall) are attributed to the architect [[Sinan]]. Badly damaged by earthquake in 1914, it was renovated afterwards.
Most of the churches have been destroyed, only a few remain, especially the ''Aya Payana Church'' (Turkish: ''Aya Baniya Kilisesi''); a Greek-Orthodox church from 1750. In a state of ruin since 1923, the roof was re-covered in 1999. Another renovation is planned but has not yet been carried out (as of 2022)
