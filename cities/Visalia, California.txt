==History==
{{Main|History of Visalia}}

The area around Visalia was first settled by the [[Yokuts]] and [[Mono tribe|Mono Native American]] tribes hundreds of years ago.<ref>The Tulare County Chamber of Commerce. ''A Few Facts about Tulare County California: History of Tulare County''. Visalia, California. 1959. 11.</ref> When the first Europeans arrived is unknown, but the first to make a written record of the area was [[Pedro Fages]] in 1722.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.downtownvisalia.com/?Page=stat.ascx |title=Downtown Visalia Statistics |publisher=Downtownvisalia.com |access-date=October 24, 2012 |archive-date=May 21, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521150757/http://downtownvisalia.com/?Page=stat.ascx |url-status=live }}</ref>

When California achieved [[U.S. state|statehood]] in 1850, Tulare County did not exist. The land that is now Tulare County was part of the vast [[County of Mariposa]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mycaliforniagenealogy.com/ca-county-tulare.html#eh |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009130249/http://www.mycaliforniagenealogy.com/ca-county-tulare.html#eh |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 9, 2009 |title=Tulare County, California Genealogical Records Information |publisher=Mycaliforniagenealogy.com |access-date=October 24, 2012}}</ref> In 1852, some pioneers settled in the area, then called Four Creeks. The area got its name from the many watershed creeks and rivers flowing from the Sierra Nevada Mountains. All the water resulted in a widespread swampy area with a magnificent oak forest. The industrious group of settlers petitioned the state legislature for county status, and on July 10 of that same year, Tulare County became a reality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ceres.ca.gov/geo_area/counties/Tulare/landmarks.html |title=CERES: State Historical Landmarks for Tulare County - NO.410 CHARTER OAK OR ELECTION TREE |publisher=Ceres.ca.gov |access-date=October 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104112224/http://ceres.ca.gov/geo_area/counties/Tulare/landmarks.html |archive-date=January 4, 2013}}</ref>

One of the first inhabitants of a fort built by the settlers was Nathaniel Vise, who was responsible for surveying the new settlement. In November 1852, he wrote, "The town contains from 60–80 inhabitants, 30 of whom are children of school age. The town is located upon one of the subdivisions of the [[Kaweah River]] and is destined to be the county seat of Tulare." In 1853, that prediction became a reality and Visalia has remained the county seat since that time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/FtVisalia.html |title=Historic California Posts: Fort Visalia |publisher=Militarymuseum.org |access-date=October 24, 2012 |archive-date=December 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121212033745/http://www.militarymuseum.org/FtVisalia.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[http://www.calarchives4u.com/history/tulare/tul1913-ch1.txt California Genealogy & History Archives] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218163442/http://www.calarchives4u.com/history/tulare/tul1913-ch1.txt |date=December 18, 2014 }}</ref> Visalia is named for Nathaniel Vise's ancestral home, [[Visalia, Kentucky]].

Early growth in Visalia can be attributed in part to the [[gold rush]] along the [[Kern River]]. The gold fever brought many transient miners through Visalia along the way, and when the lure of gold failed to materialize, many returned to Visalia to live their lives and raise families. In 1859, Visalia was added to [[Butterfield Overland Mail in California|John Butterfield's Overland Stage route]] from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] to [[San Francisco]]. A plaque commemorating the location can be found at 116 East Main Street. Included in the early citizens were some notorious and nasty individuals who preyed upon the travelers along the Butterfield Stage route. Many saloons and hotels sprouted up around the stage stop [[Downtown Visalia|downtown]] and commerce was brisk if a bit risky.<ref>[http://www.calarchives4u.com/history/tulare/tul1913-ch4.txt California Genealogy & History Archives] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218160237/http://www.calarchives4u.com/history/tulare/tul1913-ch4.txt |date=December 18, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/22491/files/Butterfield%20Stations%20in%20California.pdf |title=Butterfield Overland Mail Stage Route |access-date=October 24, 2012 |archive-date=October 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016170200/http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/22491/files/Butterfield%20Stations%20in%20California.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

The next memorable event was the arrival of the [[telegraph]] in 1860. Visalians then could get timely information of the events taking place on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] that would ultimately develop into the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. During the war, many citizens of Visalia could not decide whether Visalia should stand on the side of the North or the South, so they simply had a mini Civil War of their own on Main Street. No one really knows the outcome of the war, but apparently it was concluded to the satisfaction of the participants and life returned to normal. The federal government, however, was not so easily convinced, and reacting to concern about sedition, banned Visalia's pro-South ''Equal Rights Expositor'' newspaper and established a military garrison. Camp Babbitt was built in 1862 to stop overt Southern support and maintain law and order in the community. During these Civil War years, Visalia was incorporated, which gave the town new rights.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/article/20090718/LIFESTYLE/907180342/0/NEWS01/Pioneer+life++The+telegraph+arrives++and+war+continues&theme=150TH |title=Pioneer life: The telegraph arrives, and war continues |publisher=Visaliatimesdelta.com |access-date=October 24, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930025907/http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/article/20090718/LIFESTYLE/907180342/0/NEWS01/Pioneer+life++The+telegraph+arrives++and+war+continues%26theme%3D150TH |archive-date=September 30, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The second incorporation in 1874 moved Visalia into city status with a common council and an ex-officio mayor and president.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carnegie-libraries.org/california/visalia.html |title=Visalia, Tulare County |publisher=Carnegie-libraries.org |access-date=October 24, 2012 |archive-date=May 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514225857/http://www.carnegie-libraries.org/california/visalia.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1893, the train bandits and murderers [[John Sontag]] and [[Christopher Evans (outlaw)|Chris Evans]] were apprehended, badly wounded, outside Visalia in what is called the [[Battle of Stone Corral]].

In October 1933, Visalia was the site of a fact-finding committee appointed by Governor [[James Rolph]] and charged with investigating labor violence in the San Joaquin cotton strike. Labor activist [[Caroline Decker]] led hundreds of strikers in a march on the courthouse, and led the questioning of strikers during the investigation. In the mid-1970s, the area was known for the serial burglaries of the then unidentified [[Visalia Ransacker]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.yourcentralvalley.com/news/national-network-shining-light-on-more-than-40-year-visalia-cold-case/1050830357 |title=National network shining light on more than 40-year Visalia cold case |last=Rupe |first=Megan |date=March 16, 2018 |work=YOURCENTRALVALLEY |access-date=April 23, 2018 |language=en-US |archive-date=June 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612152053/http://www.yourcentralvalley.com/news/national-network-shining-light-on-more-than-40-year-visalia-cold-case/1050830357 |url-status=live }}</ref> More recently, Visalia served as a host city for the [[Amgen Tour of California]] in 2009 and 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amgentourofcalifornia.com/ |title=AMGEN Tour of California |publisher=AMGEN Tour of California |access-date=October 24, 2012 |archive-date=November 4, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051104020533/http://www.amgentourofcalifornia.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Visalia is irregularly shaped and covers a total area of {{cvt|36.3|sqmi|km2|0}}, of which {{cvt|36.3|sqmi|km2}} are land and 0.05% is covered by water. Visalia is located at 36°19'27" North, 119°18'26" West (36.324100, −119.307347).<ref name="GR1">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=April 23, 2011 |date=February 12, 2011 |title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990 |archive-date=August 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190824085937/https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The hilliest parts of the Visalia area are the [[Venice Hills]] and the entire Sierra Nevada foothills east of the city. Four main streams run through the city. The major stream is the [[St. John's River (California)|St. John's River]], which begins at the diversion dam in the Kaweah River and is largely seasonal. The others are [[Mill Creek (Tulare County)|Mill Creek]], [[Cameron Creek]], and [[Packwood Creek]]. Many smaller creeks also flow through the city. The [[Friant-Kern Canal]] runs just east of the city along the western edge of the Sierra Nevada foothills.

===Cityscape===
The city is divided into neighborhoods, some of which were [[Place (United States Census Bureau)|incorporated places]] or [[communities]]. Also, several independent cities around Visalia are popularly grouped with the city of Visalia, due to its immediate vicinity. Generally, the city is divided into these areas: [[Downtown Visalia]], North Visalia, the Eastside, Southwest Visalia, the Industrial Area, [[Mooney, Visalia, California|Mooney]], and the Westside.

===Climate===
Visalia has a [[semi-arid climate]] (''BSk'', under the [[Köppen climate classification]]), and receives just enough annual precipitation to stay out of Köppen's ''BWk'' ([[desert climate]]) classification. Visalia enjoys plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with an average of only 26 days with measurable precipitation annually.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=21157&refer=&units=us |title=Weatherbase: Historical Weather for Visalia, California, United States of America |publisher=Weatherbase.com |access-date=January 21, 2009 |archive-date=March 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322110137/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=21157&refer=&units=us |url-status=live }}</ref>

Visalia averages {{convert|10.32|in|mm|1}} of precipitation annually, which mainly occurs during the winter and spring (November through April) with generally light rain showers, but sometimes as heavy rainfall and thunderstorms. Years of average rainfall are rare; the usual pattern is [[bimodal]], with a short string of dry years (perhaps {{cvt|7|–|8|in|mm|disp=sqbr}}) followed by one or two wet years that make up the average. While the Sierra Nevada mountains farther east in Tulare County tend to receive snow every winter, snowfall is extremely rare in Visalia. The greatest snowfall recorded in the city was {{cvt|2|in|cm|1}} on January 25, 1999.<ref name = NOWData/> The city falls within USDA [[Hardiness zone|plant hardiness zone]] 9b (25 to 30 °F/-3.9 to -1.1 °C).<ref>{{Cite web |title=2023 USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map {{!}} USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map |url=https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/ |access-date=2024-08-28 |website=planthardiness.ars.usda.gov}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=ZIP Code 93290 - Visalia, California Hardiness Zones |url=https://www.plantmaps.com/93290 |access-date=2024-08-28 |website=www.plantmaps.com}}</ref>

Also, just outside the city limits is the [[Kaweah Oaks Preserve]], which is a {{cvt|322|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} nature preserve. It protects one of the last remaining valley oak [[riparian forests]] in the San Joaquin Valley.

=== The Visalia Rawhide ===
The '''Visalia Rawhide''' are a [[Minor League Baseball]] team of the [[California League]] and the [[Single-A]] affiliate of the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]. They have played their home games at [[Valley Strong Ballpark (Visalia)|Valley Strong Ballpark]] since their inception in 1946.

The team has had nine names, most of which reflected its changing major-league affiliates, most recently the [[Minnesota Twins]], [[Colorado Rockies]], [[Oakland A's]], [[Tampa Bay Rays]], and [[Arizona Diamondbacks|Diamondbacks]]. They took the name Rawhide in 2009.

In conjunction with [[Major League Baseball]]'s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Rawhide were organized into the Low-A West at the Low-A classification.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mayo |first=Jonathan |date=February 12, 2021 |title=MLB Announces New Minors Teams, Leagues |url=https://www.mlb.com/news/new-minor-league-baseball-structure |access-date=June 27, 2024 |website=Major League Baseball}}</ref> In 2022, the Low-A West became known as the California League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization, and was reclassified as a Single-A circuit.<ref>{{cite web |date=March 16, 2022 |title=Historical League Names to Return in 2022 |url=https://www.milb.com/news/minor-league-baseball-historical-league-names-to-return-in-2022 |access-date=June 27, 2024 |website=Minor League Baseball}}</ref>

===Environmental issues===
Owing to geography Visalia suffers from [[air pollution]] in the form of [[smog]], agricultural and other [[particulates]]. The Visalia area and the rest of the San Joaquin Valley are susceptible to [[Inversion (meteorology)|atmospheric inversion]], which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, [[locomotive]]s, manufacturing, and other sources. Unlike other cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Visalia gets only {{cvt|11.03|in|mm|2}} of rain each year; pollution accumulates over many consecutive days. Issues of air quality in Visalia and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]]. More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating [[low emission vehicle]]s. Particulate pollution can also be high during the winter due to frequent low-level inversions and during longer periods of dry weather. The same low-level inversions that cause high pollution levels in the winter also cause the frequent dense fog, locally known as [[Tule fog]].

As a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades. The number of stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium. Despite improvement, the 2006 annual report of the [[American Lung Association]] ranked the city as the 11th-most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution.<ref name="shortTermPollutedCities">[http://lungaction.org/reports/sota06_table2.html People at Risk In 25 U.S. Cities Most Polluted by Short-Term Particle Pollution.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122050859/http://lungaction.org/reports/sota06_table2.html |date=January 22, 2009 }} [[American Lung Association]].

===== Former =====
The [[Visalia Electric Railroad]] ran eastward from the city, and at one time had lines extending to [[Woodlake, California|Woodlake]] and [[Strathmore, California|Strathmore]], with the line to Woodlake being electrified. The VE was operational from 1906 to 1990, when the line was abandoned and pulled up east of Exeter.<ref name=":0" />

Visalia was formerly a station stop on the [[Visalia District]] of the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]]. A depot and small yard were located in the city. The line was originally built by the [[San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Railroad]]. The portion of this rail line through Visalia was abandoned and removed in 1994.

In 1887, the Visalia and Tulare railroad was established between its two namesake cities. The railroad ceased operation by October 1900, a victim of competition and an accident with a wandering calf on May 7, 1900, which injured several people.<ref name=":0" />
