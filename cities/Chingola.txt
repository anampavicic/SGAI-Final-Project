'''Chingola''' is a town in Zambia's [[Copperbelt Province]], the country's [[copper extraction|copper-mining]] region, with a population of 256,560 (2022 census).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Zambia: Provinces, Major Cities & Urban Centers - Population Statistics, Maps, Charts, Weather and Web Information |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/zambia/cities/ |access-date=2024-09-11 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref> It is the home of [[Nchanga Mines|Nchanga Copper Mine]], a deep-shaft high-grade content copper mining operation, which subsequently (in the 1960s) led to the development of two [[open cast mine|open pit]] operations, Chingola Open Pit and then Nchanga Open Pit (the latter being the second largest open cast mine in the world).

==History==
Chingola was founded in 1943, somewhat later than most other [[Copperbelt]] towns. Chingola was built to service the newly opened [[Nchanga Mines|Nchanga copper mine]]. Alongside [[Luanshya]] (the "Garden Town of the Copperbelt"), Chingola is perhaps one of the best laid-out and most picturesque towns in Zambia.{{Fact?|date=August 2024}}

{{Further|Mining in Zambia|}}
Situated at the north-west end of the [[Copperbelt Province]], the Nchanga Mines Open Pit workings lie in an arc 11&nbsp;km long around the west and north of the town, covering nearly 30&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. The deepest part of the pit is 400 m lower than the surrounding plateau.

The Mimbula Copper Project is a copper rich oxide and sulphide deposit, located on the outskirts of the town of Chingola on a mining licence held by Moxico Resources’  Zambian unit. Moxico Resources is a development and exploration mining company incorporated in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mining Technology |first= |date=7 April 2022 |title=moxico-zambia-copper-mine |url=https://www.mining-technology.com/news/moxico-zambia-copper-mine/ |access-date=19 April 2022 |website=mining-technology.com/news/moxico-zambia-copper-mine/}}</ref> In 2021, Moxico Resources began construction of a 10,000 tonne Leach Pad, Solvent Extraction and Electrowinning Plant. The Plant is expected to be operational by Q2 2022 and is planned to be expanded in phases.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Zambia Chamber of Mines |date=April 2022 |title=newsletter-issue-no-8-out-now |url=http://mines.org.zm/newsletter-issue-no-8-out-now/ |access-date=14 May 2022 |website=mines.org.zm}}</ref>

==Communications==
A freight-only branch of [[Zambian Railways]] services the town from Kitwe. The branch includes the movement of copper ore to the smelters at Nkana in Kitwe.

Chingola is on the main Copperbelt Highway (the [[T3 road (Zambia)|T3 road]]) running north to [[Lubumbashi]] in [[DR Congo]] via [[Chililabombwe]] and [[Konkola]] and running south-east to [[Kapiri Mposhi]] via [[Kitwe]] and [[Ndola]]. It is also at the start of the [[T5 road (Zambia)|T5 road]], running west-north-west to a border with Angola via [[Solwezi]] and [[Mwinilunga]].<ref name=":32">{{Cite web |title=Roads and Road Traffic Act {{!}} National Assembly of Zambia |url=https://www.parliament.gov.zm/node/1492 |access-date=2022-06-27 |website=www.parliament.gov.zm}}</ref>

Chingola is served by [[Kasompe Airport]], ([[IATA]] code: CGJ). It is also served by 2 shopping malls: The Park Mall and the Motherland Shopping Mall.

==Public facilities==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2024}}
The town has two hospitals: Nchanga North General Hospital (Government-owned, bed capacity 283) and Nchanga South Hospital (privately owned by the KCM (Konkola Copper Mines Plc), bed capacity about 100). The town also has sports amenities that were previously managed and maintained by the subsidiary of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Limited, Nchanga Division; These include Crickets Club, Swimming pool (non functional), Rugby Club, Golf Club, tennis and Cinema (now converted into a church). These clubs are all located along Fern Avenue, aside from the golf course. There are several lodges in Chingola and one notable hotel, Protea by Marriott Chingola located along Kabundi road. Nchanga Rangers Football club is the towns largest soccer club and officiates games at the towns largest soccer stadium located near Nchanga North suburbs.

During the 60's, 70's and 80's, Chingola was hailed as the cleanest and well maintained town in Zambia. This was due, in part, to the mining company's policy to manage and maintain social services in the town, particularly in residential areas where employees of the mining company resided. The mining conglomerate ZCCM Limited and its subsidiaries, such as Nchanga Division, also had a strong CSR agenda that extended to residential areas and communities not directly linked to the mines.
