Panipat district was carved out from the erstwhile [[Karnal]] district on 1 November 1989. On 24 July 1991 it was again merged with Karnal district. On 1 January 1992, it again became a separate district.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Geographical Status {{!}} Panipat, Haryana {{!}} India |url=https://panipat.gov.in/geographical-status/ |access-date=19 July 2021 |language=en-US}}</ref>

Panipat was the scene of three pivotal battles that changed the history of Indian Subcontinent.

The [[First Battle of Panipat]] was fought on 21 April 1526 between [[Ibrahim Lodhi]], the Afghan [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultan of Delhi]], and the [[Turko-Mongol]] warlord [[Babur]], who later established [[Mughal Empire|Mughal rule]] in Northern Indian subcontinent. Babur's force defeated Ibrahim's much larger force of over one lakh (one hundred thousand) soldiers because of the technological advantage of [[field artillery]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=First Battle of Panipat (1526) {{!}} Panipat, Haryana {{!}} India |url=https://panipat.gov.in/first-battle/ |access-date=13 April 2023 |language=en-US}}</ref> This first battle of Panipat thus ended the 'Lodi Rule' established by Bahlul Lodhi in Delhi. This battle marked the beginning of Mughal rule in India.

The [[Second Battle of Panipat]] was fought on 5 November 1556 between the forces of [[Akbar]] and [[Hem Chandra Vikramaditya]], the last Hindu emperor of Delhi.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&pg=PA13 |title=The Mughal Empire |series=The New Cambridge History of India |editor-first=John F. |editor-last=Richards |edition=7th |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1995 |orig-date=1993 |isbn=978-0-521-56603-2 |page=13 |access-date=29 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SrdiVPsFRYIC&pg=PA163 |title=Naukar, Rajput, and Sepoy: The Ethnohistory of the Military Labour Market of Hindustan, 1450-1850 |first=Dirk H.

On not seeing him in his [[howdah]] on the back of an [[elephant]], his army fled. The unconscious Hemu was carried to Akbar's camp where Bairam Khan beheaded him.<ref name="auto">Abdul Quadir Badayuni, Muntkhib-ul-Tawarikh, Volume 1, page 6</ref> According to the historic sources [[Hemu]] and his army consisted of 1500 [[war elephant]]s and a vanguard of [[artillery]] park.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Second Battle of Panipat (1556) {{!}} Panipat, Haryana {{!}} India |url=https://panipat.gov.in/second-battle/ |access-date=13 April 2023 |language=en-US}}</ref>

The [[Third Battle of Panipat]] was fought on 14 January 1761. The [[Maratha Empire]] provoked the King of [[Afghanistan]], [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]].

===Ibrahim Lodhi's Tomb===
{{main|Ibrahim Lodhi's Tomb}} 
It was one of [[Sher Shah Suri]]'s dying regrets that he could never fulfill his intention of erecting a tomb to the fallen monarch Ibrahim Lodhi. Much later, in 1866, the British relocated the tomb which was just a simple grave during construction of the [[Grand Trunk Road]] and added a platform to it with an inscription highlighting Ibrahim Lodhi's death in the Battle of Panipat.<ref name=IL1>{{cite web |url=http://www.haryana-online.com/tomb_of_ibrahim_lodhi.htm |title=Tomb of Ibrahim Lodi |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514085608/http://haryana-online.com/tomb_of_ibrahim_lodhi.htm |archive-date=14 May 2008}}</ref><ref name=IL2>{{cite web |url=http://www.india9.com/i9show/Ibrahim-Lodhi's-Tomb-14121.htm |title=Ibrahim Lodhi's Tomb in Panipat India |website=www.india9.com}}</ref><ref name=IL3>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100314040211/http://www.hindu.com/mp/2005/07/04/stories/2005070400980200.htm The tale of the missing Lodi tomb] [[The Hindu]], 4 July 2005.</ref>

===Babur's Kabuli Bagh Mosque===
{{main|Kabuli Bagh Mosque}} 
The garden of Kabuli Bagh along with the [[Kabuli Bagh Mosque]] and a tank were built by [[Babur]] after the [[Battle of Panipat (1526)|First Battle of Panipat]] to commemorate his victory over [[Ibrahim Lodhi]]. Some years later when Humayun defeated [[Sher Shah Suri]] near Panipat, he added a masonry Platform to it and called it 'Chabutra" Fateh Mubarak, bearing the inscription 934 Hijri (1557 CE). These buildings and the garden still exist under the name of Kabuli Bagh called so after Babur's wife – Mussammat Kabuli begum.

[[File:Kala Amb Memorial 2.jpg|thumb|Kala Amb Memorial]]

===Kala Amb===
{{main|Kala Amb}}
According to tradition, the site 8&nbsp;km from Panipat and 42&nbsp;km from Karnal, where [[Sadashiv Rao Bhau]] commanded his [[Maratha]] forces during the third battle of Panipat was marked by a black Mango Tree (Kala Amb) which has since disappeared. The dark colour of its foliage was probably the origin of the name. The site has a brick Pillar with an iron rod and the structure is surrounded by an iron fence. The site is being developed and beautified by a society presided over by the Governor of [[Haryana]].

===Prachin Sidhh Shree Devi Mandir===


Shree Devi Mandir is one of the most appealing religious places in [[Panipat]] city. Standing along the ''Devi Mandir Road'' in the [[Tehsil]] Camp Locality and opposite to it is the ''Cygnus Maharaja Aggrasen Hospital'', one of the biggest and most facilitated hospital in Panipat. Here reside the idols of all the [[Hindus|Hindu]] [[Deity|Gods]] and [[Goddess|Goddesses]]. It used to have a large ''Sarovar'' (Water tank for religious practices), but it dried years ago due to a past drought that fell upon Panipat decades ago. It has now been converted into a lush green playground. If you are in Panipat do visit this temple, especially recommended during [[Navaratri|navratri]] festival [[Fair|fair]].

==Panipat Syndrome==
The term "Panipat Syndrome" has entered the lexicon as the lack of strategic thinking, preparedness and decisive action by Indian leaders thus allowing an invading army to enter well inside their territory. This is based on the fact that in the three battles fought here, the defending armies were decisively defeated each time. It was coined by Air Commodore [[Jasjit Singh (IAF officer)|Jasjit Singh]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/books-and-more-the-indian-army-and-the-panipat-syndrome-1157996 |title=The Indian Army and the 'Panipat Syndrome' |date=30 March 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-afghanistan-peace-narendra-modi-ashraf-ghani-saarc-3063903/ |title=Raja Mandala: Breaking the Panipat syndrome |date=4 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/column/why-india-suffers-from-the-panipat-syndrome/20160212.htm |title=Why India suffers from the Panipat Syndrome}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.indiandefencereview.com/spotlights/indian-defence-philosophy-a-no-win-concept/ |title=Indian Defence Philosophy: A 'no-win' Concept|date=16 May 2015 }}</ref>
