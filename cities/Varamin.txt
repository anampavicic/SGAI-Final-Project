==Etymology==
The word "''Varamin''" has been recorded with the same spelling and pronunciation in Perso-Arabic script since 3rd A.H. century.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tājīk |first1=ʻAlī Riz̤ā |last2=Atrī |first2=Siyyidizahrā |title=Ās̲ār-i tārīkhī-i Varāmīn-i bāstān |date=2005 |publisher=Mihr-i Amīr al-Muʼminīn |location=Tihrān |isbn=9789648173833 |edition=Chāp-i 1 |language=Persian}}</ref> While its etymology is not clear, there have been many speculations which are almost all not more than guesses. The entry "Varām" in [[Burhan-i Qati]] is defined as:"... Things that are easy and light, and a city in ''Mulk-i [[Rayy]]'' that is known also as ''Varāmin''."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Amini |first1=Mohammad |last2=Rezvan |first2=Homayun |title=Tarikh-e Ejtemai-e Varamin |date=2003 |publisher=Elmi Farhangi Saheb-az-zaman |location=Tehran |isbn=9640612278 |page=88}}</ref> [[Mir Jalaleddin Kazzazi]] says "Varām" is a variant of the name [[Bahram (name)|Bahram]] (equivalent to [[Vahram (disambiguation)|Vahram]] in Pahlavi and Armenian), and may be from ''Varām+in'' meaning 'place of Bahram.'<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kazzazi |first1=Mir Jalaleddin |title=Varamin: City of Bahram |journal=Ashena |volume=2 |issue=7 |url=http://ensani.ir/fa/article/274061/%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85 |access-date=3 March 2024 |language=Persian}}</ref>

==History==
Until 1220s, Varamin was an agricultural center of Ray. The raiding of [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] by the [[Mongol invasion of Persia|invading Mongols]] caused a flux of migration and economical growth during Mongol [[Ilkhanid]] rule. Thus, Varamin developed into an urban center. A Vizier of [[Ilkhanid]] [[Abu Sa'id (Ilkhanid dynasty)|Abu Sa'id]], named Yusuf Quhadhi built the [[Jameh Mosque of Varamin]]. Other significant monuments from this era, include [[mausoleum]] of [[Imamzadeh Yahya]], [[Aladdin Tower]], Imamzadeh Shah Husayn, and Sharif mosque. At the turn of 14th century, Varamin started to decline due to [[Timurid Empire]] armies' invasions. In 1405, [[Ruy González de Clavijo]] described the city as mostly deserted, although during early Timurid rule, a minor restoration was applied to the Jameh mosque and [[Imamzadeh Hosein Reza]] was built. By 16th century, [[Tehran]] started to grow as the major city of the region.<ref name="grove">{{cite book |last1=Bloom |first1=Jonathan |last2=Blair |first2=Sheila |title=Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art & Architecture: Three-Volume Set |date=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780195373042 |page=391 }}</ref>
