Michigan consists of two [[peninsula]]s. The [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsula]] resembles the shape of a [[mitten]], and comprises a majority of the state's land area. The [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] (often called "the U.P.") is separated from the Lower Peninsula by the [[Straits of Mackinac]], a {{convert|5|mi|km|0|adj=on|spell=in}} channel that joins Lake Huron to Lake Michigan. The [[Mackinac Bridge]] connects the peninsulas. Michigan has the longest [[freshwater]] coastline of any political subdivision in the United States, being bordered by four of the five [[Great Lakes]] and [[Lake St. Clair]].<ref name="NOAA-CRM">{{cite web |title = Ocean and Coastal Management in Michigan |url = http://coastalmanagement.noaa.gov/mystate/mi.html |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130215041213/http://coastalmanagement.noaa.gov/mystate/mi.html |archive-date = February 15, 2013 |access-date = July 25, 2010 |publisher = NOAA Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management}}</ref> It also has 64,980 [[List of lakes of Michigan|inland lakes and ponds]].<ref>{{cite web |last = Breck |first = James E. |title = Compilation of Databases on Michigan Lakes |url = http://www.michigandnr.com/PUBLICATIONS/PDFS/ifr/ifrlibra/technical/reports/2004-2tr.pdf |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090314225532/http://www.michigandnr.com/PUBLICATIONS/PDFS/ifr/ifrlibra/technical/reports/2004-2tr.pdf |archive-date = March 14, 2009 |access-date = April 18, 2009 |publisher = [[Michigan Department of Natural Resources]] |page = 5 |quote = Another unique code (Unique_ID) was previously assigned to all 70,542 polygons, including 5,527 islands, 35 streams and 64,980 lakes and ponds down to 0.008 acres (31.4 m2, 338 ft2 ).}}</ref> Michigan has the second-most water area of any state, behind only Alaska.<ref>"United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts, 2010 Census of Population and Housing" (PDF).

The area was first occupied by a succession of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes over thousands of years. In the 17th century, French explorers claimed it as part of the [[New France]] colony, when it was largely inhabited by Indigenous peoples. French and Canadian traders and settlers, [[Métis]], and others migrated to the area, settling largely along the waterways. After France's defeat in the [[French and Indian War]] in 1762, the region came under British rule. Britain ceded the territory to the newly independent United States after its defeat in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The area was part of the larger [[Northwest Territory]] until 1800, when western Michigan became part of the [[Indiana Territory]]. [[Michigan Territory]] was formed in 1805, but some of the northern border with [[Canada]] was not agreed upon until after the [[War of 1812]]. Michigan was admitted into the Union in 1837 as the 26th state, a [[Slave states and free states|free one]]. It soon became an important center of industry and trade in the Great Lakes region, attracting immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries from many [[Europe|European countries]].

Although Michigan has developed a diverse economy, in the early 20th century it became widely known as the center of the [[Automotive industry in the United States|U.S. automotive industry]], which developed as a major national economic force. It is home to the country's [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|three major automobile companies]] (whose headquarters are all in Metro Detroit).

When the first European explorers arrived, the most populous tribes were the [[Algonquian peoples]], which include the [[Anishinaabe]] groups of [[Ojibwe]], [[Ottawa (tribe)|Odaawaa/Odawa (Ottawa)]], and the [[Potawatomi|Boodewaadamii/Bodéwadmi (Potawatomi)]]. The three nations coexisted peacefully as part of a loose confederation called the [[Council of Three Fires]]. The Ojibwe, whose numbers are estimated to have been at least 35,000, were the largest.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Pritzker |first=Barry |title=A Native American Encyclopedia: History, Culture, and Peoples |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2000 |isbn=9780195138771 |pages=342}}</ref>

The Ojibwe Indians (also known as Chippewa in the U.S.), an Anishinaabe tribe, were established in Michigan's Upper Peninsula and [[northern Michigan|northern]] and [[central Michigan]]. Bands also inhabited [[Ontario]] and southern [[Manitoba]], Canada; and northern [[Wisconsin]], and northern and north-central [[Minnesota]]. The Ottawa Indians lived primarily south of the [[Straits of Mackinac]] in northern, [[western Michigan|western]], and [[southern Michigan]], but also in southern Ontario, northern Ohio, and eastern Wisconsin. The Potawatomi were in southern and western Michigan, in addition to northern and central Indiana, northern Illinois, southern Wisconsin, and southern Ontario. Other Algonquian tribes in Michigan, in the south and east, were the [[Mascouten]], the [[Menominee]], the [[Miami (tribe)|Miami]], the [[Sac people|Sac]] (or Sauk), and the [[Meskwaki|Meskwaki (Fox)]]. The [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] were an Iroquoian-speaking people in this area; they were historically known as the Huron by the French, and were the historical adversaries of the [[Iroquois Confederation]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://wyandotte-nation.org/culture/our-history/ | title=Our History }}, Wyandotte Nation</ref>

French ''[[voyageurs]]'' and ''[[Coureur des bois|coureurs des bois]]'' explored and settled in Michigan in the 17th century. The first Europeans to reach what became Michigan were those of [[Étienne Brûlé]]'s expedition in 1622. The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1668 on the site where Père [[Jacques Marquette]] established [[Sault Ste.

In 1701, French explorer and army officer [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]] founded [[Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit]] or "Fort Pontchartrain on-the-Strait" on the strait, known as the [[Detroit River]], between lakes [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Saint Clair]] and [[Lake Erie|Erie]].{{cn|date=February 2024}} Cadillac had convinced [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV's]] chief minister, [[Louis Phélypeaux (1643-1727)|Louis Phélypeaux, Comte de Pontchartrain]], that a permanent community there would strengthen French control over the upper Great Lakes and discourage [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] aspirations.{{cn|date=February 2024}}

The hundred soldiers and workers who accompanied Cadillac built a fort enclosing one [[arpent]] (about {{convert|0.85|acre|m2}},<ref name=tbaytel>{{cite web |url = http://my.tbaytel.net/bmartin/cadillac.htm |title = Cadillac's Village or Detroit under Cadillac |access-date = January 5, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061209205600/http://my.tbaytel.net/bmartin/cadillac.htm |archive-date = December 9, 2006 |url-status = live}}</ref><ref name=histdet>{{cite web |url = http://www.historydetroit.com/places/fort_ponchartrain.asp |title = History Detroit 1701–2001 |access-date = January 5, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061209065758/http://www.historydetroit.com/places/fort_ponchartrain.asp |archive-date = December 9, 2006 |url-status = live}}</ref> the equivalent of just under {{convert|200|ft|m}} per side) and named it [[Fort Pontchartrain]]. Cadillac's wife, Marie Thérèse Guyon, soon moved to Detroit, becoming one of the first European women to settle in what was considered the wilderness of Michigan. The town quickly became a major [[fur trade|fur-trading]] and shipping post. The ''[[Ste. Anne de Detroit Catholic Church|Église de Saint-Anne]]'' (Catholic Church of Saint Anne) was founded the same year.{{cn|date=February 2024}} While the original building does not survive, the congregation remains active.{{cn|date=February 2024}} Cadillac later departed to serve as the French governor of Louisiana from 1710 to 1716.{{cn|date=February 2024}} French attempts to consolidate the fur trade led to the [[Fox Wars]], in which the Meskwaki (Fox) and their allies fought the French and their Native allies.{{cn|date=February 2024}}

At the same time, the French strengthened [[Fort Michilimackinac]] at the Straits of Mackinac to better control their lucrative fur-trading empire. By the mid-18th century, the French also occupied forts at present-day Niles and Sault Ste. Marie, though most of the rest of the region remained unsettled by Europeans. France offered free land to attract families to Detroit, which grew to 800 people in 1765.

During the [[American Revolutionary War]], Detroit was an important British supply center. Most of the inhabitants were French-Canadians or American Indians, many of whom had been allied with the French because of long trading ties. Because of imprecise cartography and unclear language defining the boundaries in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783 Treaty of Paris]], the British retained control of Detroit and Michigan after the [[American Revolution]]. When Quebec split into Lower and Upper Canada in 1791, Michigan was part of [[Kent County, Ontario|Kent County]], Upper Canada. It held its first democratic elections in August 1792 to send delegates to the new provincial parliament at Newark (now [[Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario|Niagara-on-the-Lake]]).<ref name=SFarmer>{{Cite book |last = Farmer |first = Silas |title = The History of Detroit and Michigan; or, The Metropolis Illustrated; A Full Record of Territorial Days in Michigan, and the Annals of Wayne County |orig-year = 1889 |url = http://name.umdl.umich.edu/bad1459.0001.001 |access-date = June 15, 2006 |year = 2005 |via = University of Michigan Library |page = 94 |chapter = Legislatures and Laws |chapter-url = http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=micounty;cc=micounty;rgn=full%20text;idno=BAD1459.0001.001;didno=BAD1459.0001.001;view=image;seq=00000152}}</ref>

Under terms negotiated in the 1794 [[Jay Treaty]], Britain withdrew from Detroit and Michilimackinac in 1796. It retained control of territory east and south of the Detroit River, which are now included in Ontario, Canada. Questions remained over the boundary for many years, and the United States did not have uncontested control of the Upper Peninsula and [[Drummond Island]] until 1818 and 1847, respectively.

During the [[War of 1812]], the United States forces at Fort Detroit surrendered [[Michigan Territory]] (effectively consisting of Detroit and the surrounding area) after a nearly bloodless [[Siege of Detroit|siege]] in 1812. A U.S. attempt to retake Detroit resulted in a severe American defeat in the [[River Raisin Massacre]]. This battle, still ranked as the bloodiest ever fought in the state, had the highest number of American casualties of any battle of the war.

Michigan was recaptured by the Americans in 1813 after the [[Battle of Lake Erie]]. They used Michigan as a base to launch an invasion of Canada, which culminated in the [[Battle of the Thames]]. But the more northern areas of Michigan were held by the British until the peace treaty restored the old boundaries. A number of forts, including [[Fort Wayne (Detroit)|Fort Wayne]], were built by the United States in Michigan during the 19th century out of fears of renewed fighting with Britain.

The population grew slowly until the opening in 1825 of the [[Erie Canal]] through the Mohawk Valley in New York, connecting the Great Lakes to the Hudson River and New York City.{{cn|date=February 2024}} The new route attracted a large influx of settlers to the Michigan territory.

On November 1, 1935, the U.S. Post Office issued a commemorative 3-cent stamp celebrating the 100th anniversary of Michigan statehood. Michigan's statehood, however, wasn't officially established until January 26, 1837, but since the campaign for statehood actually began in 1835, Michigan chose to hold its centennial celebration in 1935, the year the stamp was first issued.<ref name=centennial>{{cite web |first= |last= |title=Michigan Centenary Issue |publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |year= |accessdate=November 3, 2023 |url=https://postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibition/about-us-stamps-bureau-period-1894-1939-commemorative-issues-1934-1935/michigan-centenary |ref=smithsonian35 |archive-date=November 4, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231104024922/https://postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibition/about-us-stamps-bureau-period-1894-1939-commemorative-issues-1934-1935/michigan-centenary |url-status=live }}</ref>

Michigan received the western part of the Upper Peninsula as a concession and formally entered the Union as a [[slave and free states|free state]] on January 26, 1837. The Upper Peninsula proved to be a rich source of lumber, iron, and copper. Michigan led the nation in lumber production from the 1850s to the 1880s.

A feature of Michigan that gives it the distinct shape of a mitten is [[the Thumb]], which projects into Lake Huron, forming [[Saginaw Bay]]. Other notable peninsulas of Michigan include the [[Keweenaw Peninsula]], which projects northeasterly into Lake Superior from the Upper Peninsula and largely comprising Michigan's [[Copper Country]] region, and the [[Leelanau Peninsula]], projecting from the Lower Peninsula into Lake Michigan, forming Michigan's "little finger".

Numerous lakes and [[marsh]]es mark both peninsulas, and the coast is much indented. Keweenaw Bay, [[Whitefish Bay]], and the Big and [[Little Bay de Noc|Little]] Bays De Noc are the principal indentations on the Upper Peninsula. The Grand and [[Little Traverse Bay|Little Traverse]], [[Thunder Bay (Michigan)|Thunder]], and Saginaw bays indent the Lower Peninsula.

[[File:Köppen Climate Types Michigan.png|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] of Michigan, using 1991–2020 [[Climatological normal|climate normals]]]]

Michigan has a [[humid continental climate|continental climate]] with two distinct regions. The southern and central parts of the Lower Peninsula (south of Saginaw Bay and from the Grand Rapids area southward) have a warmer climate ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfa'') with hot summers and cold winters. The northern part of the Lower Peninsula and the entire Upper Peninsula has a more severe climate (Köppen ''Dfb''), with warm, but shorter summers and longer, cold to very cold winters. Some parts of the state average high temperatures below freezing from December through February, and into early March in the far northern parts. During the winter through the middle of February, the state is frequently subjected to heavy [[lake-effect snow]]. The state averages from {{convert|30|to|40|in|cm}} of precipitation annually; however, some areas in the northern lower peninsula and the upper peninsula average almost {{convert|160|in}} of snowfall per year.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.crh.noaa.gov/apx/snow/snowfallAvg.php |title = Mean Annual Snowfall |author = NWS Gaylord Region |date = August 31, 2010 |publisher = National Weather Service |access-date = June 1, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111109014721/http://www.crh.noaa.gov/apx/snow/snowfallAvg.php |archive-date = November 9, 2011 |url-status = live}}</ref> Michigan's highest recorded temperature is {{convert|112|F|C}} at [[Mio, Michigan|Mio]] on July 13, 1936, and the coldest recorded temperature is {{convert|-51|F|C}} at [[Vanderbilt, Michigan|Vanderbilt]] on February 9, 1934.<ref name="netstate">{{cite web |url = http://www.netstate.com/states/geography/mi_geography.htm |title = The Geography of Michigan |publisher = netstate.com |access-date = March 20, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110321154823/http://www.netstate.com/states/geography/mi_geography.htm |archive-date = March 21, 2011 |url-status = live}}</ref>

The state averages 30 days of thunderstorm activity per year. These can be severe, especially in the southern part of the state. The state averages 17 [[tornado]]es per year, which are more common in the state's extreme southern section. Portions of the southern border have been almost as vulnerable historically as states further west and in [[Tornado Alley]]. For this reason, many communities in the very southern portions of the state have tornado sirens to warn residents of approaching tornadoes. Farther north, in Central Michigan, Northern Michigan, and the Upper Peninsula, tornadoes are rare.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://geo.msu.edu/extra/geogmich/tornades.html |title = Tornadoes |website = geo.msu.edu |access-date = April 12, 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150706174930/http://geo.msu.edu/extra/geogmich/tornades.html |archive-date = July 6, 2015 |url-status = live}}</ref><ref name="Thunderstorm hazards">{{cite web |url = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/key/HTML/tstmhazards.htm |title = Thunderstorm hazards |publisher = srh.noaa.gov |access-date = November 1, 2006 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061015060809/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/key/HTML/tstmhazards.htm |archive-date = October 15, 2006}}</ref>

===Geology===

The geological formation of the state is greatly varied, with the [[Michigan Basin]] being the most major formation. Primary boulders are found over the entire surface of the Upper Peninsula (being principally of primitive origin), while Secondary deposits cover the entire Lower Peninsula. The Upper Peninsula exhibits Lower [[Silurian]] sandstones, limestones, copper and iron bearing rocks, corresponding to the Huronian system of [[Canada]]. The central portion of the Lower Peninsula contains coal measures and rocks of the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] period. [[Devonian]] and sub-Carboniferous deposits are scattered over the entire state.

Michigan rarely experiences [[earthquake]]s, and those that it does experience are generally smaller ones that do not cause significant damage. A 4.6-magnitude earthquake struck in August 1947. More recently, a 4.2-magnitude earthquake occurred on Saturday, May 2, 2015, shortly after noon, about five miles south of [[Galesburg, Michigan]] (9 miles southeast of [[Kalamazoo]]) in central Michigan, about 140 miles west of Detroit, according to the Colorado-based [[U.S. Geological Survey]]'s [[National Earthquake Information Center]]. No major damage or injuries were reported, according to then-Governor [[Rick Snyder]]'s office.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/2015/05/02/michigan-earthquake/26773069/ |title = No injuries reported after earthquake rattles Michigan |access-date = May 3, 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150503111513/http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/2015/05/02/michigan-earthquake/26773069/ |archive-date = May 3, 2015 |url-status = live}}</ref>

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Michigan}}

{{See also|List of counties in Michigan|List of municipalities in Michigan|List of Michigan metropolitan areas}}

State government is decentralized among three tiers—statewide, county and [[Civil township|township]]. Counties are administrative divisions of the state, and townships are administrative divisions of a county. Both of them exercise state government authority, localized to meet the particular needs of their jurisdictions, as provided by state law. There are 83 [[List of counties in Michigan|counties in Michigan]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Michigan Counties |url=https://www.michigan.gov/som/about-michigan/michigan-counties |website=State of Michigan |access-date=June 29, 2023 |archive-date=June 29, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230629154922/https://www.michigan.gov/som/about-michigan/michigan-counties |url-status=live }}</ref>

Cities, [[State university system|state universities]], and villages are vested with [[home rule]] powers of varying degrees. Home rule cities can generally do anything not prohibited by law. The fifteen state universities have broad power and can do anything within the parameters of their status as educational institutions that is not prohibited by the state constitution. Villages, by contrast, have limited home rule and are not completely autonomous from the county and township in which they are located.

There are two types of township in Michigan: ''general law'' township and ''charter''. [[Charter township]] status was created by the Legislature in 1947 and grants additional powers and stream-lined administration in order to provide greater protection against annexation by a city. {{as of|2001|April}}, there were 127 charter townships in Michigan. In general, charter townships have many of the same powers as a city but without the same level of obligations. For example, a charter township can have its own fire department, water and sewer department, police department, and so on—just like a city—but it is not ''required'' to have those things, whereas cities ''must'' provide those services. Charter townships can opt to use county-wide services instead, such as deputies from the county sheriff's office instead of a home-based force of ordinance officers.

===State government===
{{Main|Government of Michigan}}

[[File:Michigan state capitol.jpg|thumb|The [[Michigan State Capitol]] in [[Lansing]] houses the [[Michigan Legislature|legislative branch]] of the government of the US state of Michigan.]]

Michigan is governed as a republic, with three [[separation of powers|branches of government]]: the [[executive branch]] consisting of the [[Governor of Michigan]] and the other independently elected constitutional officers; the [[legislative branch]] consisting of the [[Michigan State House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[Michigan Senate|Senate]]; and the [[judicial branch]]. The [[Michigan Constitution]] allows for the direct participation of the electorate by statutory [[Popular initiative|initiative]] and [[referendum]], [[recall election|recall]], and constitutional initiative and [[ratification|referral]] (Article II, § 9,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.legislature.mi.gov/printDocument.aspx?objstate=mcl-article-ii-9&version=txt |title = Article II, § 9 of State Constitution |publisher = Michigan Legislature |access-date = June 27, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130117041635/http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(dmjr2jejmjc0at2whhlicz55))/printDocument.aspx?objstate=mcl-article-ii-9&version=txt |archive-date = January 17, 2013 |url-status = live}}</ref> defined as "the power to propose laws and to enact and reject laws, called the initiative, and the power to approve or reject laws enacted by the legislature, called the referendum. The power of initiative extends only to laws which the legislature may enact under this constitution"). [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] is the [[list of capitals in the United States|state capital]] and is home to all three branches of state government.

[[File:Michigan House of Representatives.jpg|thumb|The floor of the [[Michigan House of Representatives]]]]

The governor and the other state constitutional officers serve four-year terms and may be re-elected only once. The current governor is [[Gretchen Whitmer]]. Michigan has two official [[Michigan Governor's Residence|Governor's Residences]]; one is in Lansing, and the other is on [[Mackinac Island]]. The other constitutionally elected executive officers are the [[Lieutenant Governor of Michigan|lieutenant governor]], who is elected on a joint ticket with the governor; the [[Secretary of State of Michigan|secretary of state]]; and the [[Attorney General of Michigan|attorney general]]. The lieutenant governor presides over the Senate (voting only in case of a tie) and is also a member of the cabinet. The secretary of state is the chief elections officer and is charged with running many licensure programs including motor vehicles, all of which are done through the branch offices of the secretary of state.

The [[Michigan Legislature]] consists of a 38-member Senate and 110-member House of Representatives. Members of both houses of the legislature are elected through [[first past the post]] elections by single-member electoral districts of near-equal population that often have boundaries which coincide with county and municipal lines. Senators serve four-year terms concurrent to those of the governor, while representatives serve two-year terms. The [[Michigan State Capitol]] was dedicated in 1879 and has hosted the executive and legislative branches of the state ever since.

[[File:Michigan National Guard members participate in inauguration, Adjutant General swearing-in 190101-F-VX133-049.jpg|thumb|left|Governor Gretchen Whitmer speaking at a National Guard ceremony in 2019]]

The Michigan judiciary consists of two courts with primary jurisdiction (the Circuit Courts and the District Courts), one intermediate level appellate court (the [[Michigan Court of Appeals]]), and the [[Michigan Supreme Court]]. There are several administrative courts and specialized courts. District courts are trial courts of [[limited jurisdiction]], handling most traffic violations, small claims, [[misdemeanor]]s, and civil suits where the amount contended is below $25,000. District courts are often responsible for handling the preliminary examination and for setting bail in felony cases. District court judges are elected to terms of six years. In a few locations, municipal courts have been retained to the exclusion of the establishment of district courts. There are 57 circuit courts in the State of Michigan, which have [[original jurisdiction]] over all civil suits where the amount contended in the case exceeds $25,000 and all criminal cases involving [[felony|felonies]]. Circuit courts are also the only trial courts in the State of Michigan which possess the power to issue [[equitable remedies]]. Circuit courts have [[appellate jurisdiction]] from district and municipal courts, as well as from decisions and decrees of state agencies. Most counties have their own circuit court, but sparsely populated counties often share them. Circuit court judges are elected to terms of six years. State appellate court judges are elected to terms of six years, but vacancies are filled by an appointment by the governor. There are four divisions of the Court of Appeals in Detroit, Grand Rapids, Lansing, and Marquette. Cases are heard by the Court of Appeals by panels of three judges, who examine the application of the law and not the facts of the case unless there has been grievous error pertaining to questions of fact. The Michigan Supreme Court consists of seven members who are elected on non-partisan ballots for staggered eight-year terms. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction only in narrow circumstances but holds appellate jurisdiction over the entire state judicial system.

The current document has a preamble, 11 articles, and one section consisting of a schedule and temporary provisions. Michigan, like every U.S. state except [[Louisiana]], has a [[common law]] legal system.

===Politics===
{{main|Politics of Michigan}}

Having been a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-leaning state at the presidential level since the 1990s, Michigan has evolved into a [[swing state]] after [[Donald Trump]] won the state in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]]. Governors since the 1970s have alternated between the Democrats and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], and statewide offices including [[Michigan Attorney General|attorney general]], [[Michigan Secretary of State|secretary of state]], and [[United States Senate|senator]] have been held by members of both parties in varying proportion. Additionally, from [[1994 Michigan gubernatorial election|1994]] until [[2022 Michigan gubernatorial election|2022]], the governor-elect had always come from the party opposite the presidency. The Democratic Party has a slim majority of two seats in the Senate of the [[Michigan Legislature]], and the House is currently deadlocked at 54 seats for each party. The state's [[United States congressional delegations from Michigan|congressional delegation]] is commonly split, with one party or the other typically holding a narrow majority.

Michigan was the home of [[Gerald Ford]], the 38th president of the United States. Born in Nebraska, he moved as an infant to Grand Rapids.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/history/presidents/gf38.html |title = Biography of Gerald R.

Michigan is traditionally known as "The Wolverine State", and the University of Michigan uses the wolverine as its mascot. The association is well and long established: for example, many Detroiters volunteered to fight during the American Civil War and [[George Armstrong Custer]], who led the Michigan Brigade, called them the "Wolverines". The origins of this association are obscure; it may derive from a busy trade in wolverine furs in Sault Ste. Marie in the 18th century or may recall a disparagement intended to compare early settlers in Michigan with the vicious mammal. Wolverines are, however, extremely rare in Michigan. A sighting in February 2004 near [[Ubly, Michigan|Ubly]] was the first confirmed sighting in Michigan in 200 years.<ref name="msnbc">{{cite news |title = First Michigan wolverine spotted in 200 years |url = https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna4374309 |last = Runk |first = David |date = February 25, 2004 |agency = Associated Press |publisher = NBC News |access-date = December 23, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130218042651/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4374309 |archive-date = February 18, 2013 |url-status = live}}</ref> Another wolverine was found dead in 2010.<ref>{{Cite news |last = Bell |first = Dawson |date = March 15, 2010 |title = Only known wolverine in the Michigan wild dies |newspaper = Detroit Free Press |url = http://www.freep.com/article/20100315/NEWS06/100315027/1318/Only-wolverine-in-Mich.-wild-dies |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150706133328/http://www.freep.com/article/20100315/NEWS06/100315027/1318/Only-wolverine-in-Mich.-wild-dies |archive-date = July 6, 2015}}</ref>
