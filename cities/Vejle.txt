'''Vejle''' ({{IPA|da|ˈvɑjlə}}) is a city in [[Denmark]], in the southeast of the [[Jutland Peninsula]] at the head of [[Vejle Fjord]], where the [[Vejle River]] and [[Grejs River]] and their valleys converge.  It is the site of the councils of [[Vejle Municipality]] (''[[Municipalities of Denmark|kommune]]'') and the [[Region of Southern Denmark]]. The city has a population of 61,706 ({{as of|2024|01|01|lc=on|url=https://vafo.dk/artikel/i-fire-dage-var-vejle-danmarks-ottendest%C3%B8rste-by-men-s%C3%A5-blev-tallet-rettet-byen-bider-dog-konkurrenterne-i-haserne-og-er-t%C3%A6t-p%C3%A5-at-rykke-op-i-by-hierarki}})<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-06-08 |title=I fire dage var Vejle Danmarks ottendestørste by - men så blev tallet rettet: Byen bider dog konkurrenterne i haserne og er tæt på at rykke op i by-hierarkiet |url=https://vafo.dk/artikel/i-fire-dage-var-vejle-danmarks-ottendest%C3%B8rste-by-men-s%C3%A5-blev-tallet-rettet-byen-bider-dog-konkurrenterne-i-haserne-og-er-t%C3%A6t-p%C3%A5-at-rykke-op-i-by-hierarki |access-date=2022-06-08 |website=vafo.dk |language=da}}</ref> making it the ninth largest city in Denmark. Vejle Municipality has a population of 122,022 ({{as of|2024|10|lc=on|url=https://www.vejle.dk/om-kommunen/fakta-om-os/rapporter-og-analyser/vaekstbarometer/}})<ref>{{Cite web |title=Vækstbarometer oktober 2024: Vejle Kommune har rundet 122.000 indbyggere |url=https://www.vejle.dk/om-kommunen/fakta-om-os/rapporter-og-analyser/vaekstbarometer/ |access-date=2022-06-08 |website=Vejle Kommune |language=da}}</ref> making it the fifth largest municipality in Denmark. The city is part of the [[Triangle Region (Denmark)|Triangle Region]], which includes the neighbouring cities of [[Kolding]] and [[Fredericia]] and it is located 110 kilometres (68 miles) north of Germany.

Vejle is most known for its forested hills, Vejle fjord, harbour, shopping, pedestrian mall, and windmill.

== Etymology ==

The word "Vejle" derives from the Old Danish word ''wæthel'', meaning "[[Ford (crossing)|ford]]" or "wading place" due to its location at a busy crossing over the Vejle River.

== History == 

=== Origins ===
During [[Viking]] times, the wetlands around Vejle had to be crossed at the [[Ravning Bridge]], a nearly half-mile wooden boardwalk, west of the current city.

Archaeological digs near St. Nicolai Church in downtown Vejle have shown that there were residences in the area as far back as 1100. The first recorded mention of the town is from 1256, and the first known merchant town privileges were issued by [[Valdemar III of Denmark|King Valdemar III]] in 1327.

=== Middle ages ===
During the [[Middle Ages]], Vejle was important as a [[market town]], and developed along those lines up to the mid-17th century, trading with cities such as [[Lübeck]] and [[Flensburg]], in what is now [[Germany]]. The king's castle, ''Castrum Wæthel'', was located where Vejle Trafikcenter is today.

=== Early modern period ===
In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, Vejle's population was diminished as a consequence of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and war. In 1796, though, Vejle was made the seat of the newly founded [[Vejle County]].

=== Industrialisation ===
[[File:-Vejle1900.jpg|thumb|Map of Vejle, {{circa}} 1900.]]
Throughout the 19th century, the town benefited from improvements such as [[Port of Vejle|a new harbour]] on the fjord, [[Vejle railway station|a railway station]], and modern utilities. From the mid-19th century into the 20th century, Vejle developed from a provincial market town into a busy industrial centre, eventually becoming known as the "[[Manchester]] of Denmark" for its many [[cotton mill]]s.<ref name="stadsarkiv"/>

==Geography==
===Topography===
[[File:Udsigtfrakiddesvej.jpg|thumb|View of the hills of Vejle from Kiddesvej]]
Downtown Vejle was built on an island of [[till|glacial till]] in Vejle River remaining from a hill formed during the last [[ice age]].<ref>Jensen, Jørgen Elsøe: ''Danmarks middelalderlige byplaner'', 1994 {{ISBN|87-7838-003-0}} s. 142</ref>

In a country where the highest natural elevation is only about 170&nbsp;m (558&nbsp;ft) above sea level, Vejle is known for the forested hills that rise to the north and south of the town and [[fjord]].

The valleys of the two rivers that converge at Vejle are both unique in Denmark: Vejle River Valley (''Vejle Ådal'') is the longest [[tunnel valley]] in Denmark, and the [[Grejs River|Grejs Valley]] (''Grejsdalen'') is the largest [[ravine]] in Denmark.

Both empty into [[Vejle Fjord]], which connects Vejle by water through the [[Little Belt]] strait to the [[Baltic Sea]], and through the [[Kattegat]] and [[Skagerrak]] straits to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

=== Cityscape ===
[[File:Bølgen (The Wave), Vejle, Denmark.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[The Wave (Vejle)|Bølgen]], residential building complex]]
Development of new architecture, art and alternative town spaces throughout the 1990s has made the city an attraction. Vejle was the first city in [[Denmark]], which had its own official architecture policy to set high standards for the urban development. The fjord is also the site of the [[modern architecture|modern]] wave-shaped apartment complex known as The Wave (''Bølgen'').<ref name="the-wave">{{cite web|url=http://www.archdaily.com/120948/the-wave-henning-larsen-architects|last=Vinnitskaya|first=Irina|title=The Wave / Henning Larsen Architects|website=ArchDaily|date=23 March 2011}}</ref>

===Neighbourhoods===
Many of Vejle's neighbourhoods began as separate towns or villages that merged with the city as it grew.  Søndermarken, Nørremarken, and Grejsdalen, however, were all founded as extensions of the city onto the surrounding hillsides. 

Vejle's neighbourhoods include:
*Vejle centre
*Bredballe - east of downtown and north of Vejle Fjord; considered an affluent neighbourhood
*Grejsdalen - northernmost part of the city, located in the long, narrow valley of the same name
*Hover - west of Grejsdalen
*Lille Grundet - north of downtown in the northwest corner of Nørremarken, relatively new
*Løget - southernmost part of the city
*Store Grundet - established in 2000, north of Lille Grundet
*Mølholm - southeast of the centre
*Nørremarken - northeast of the centre, including the North Woods (''Nørreskoven'') and Vejle Stadium
*Uhrhøj, Uhre, Petersminde
*Vinding - southeast, next to Mølholm
*Skibet, Knabberup - westernmost part of the city
*Søndermarken - to the southwest, located on land belonging to the former Petersholm manor
*Trædballe - north-west corner of centre

==Economy==
Vejle is the cultural and economic centre of Vejle Municipality and, as part of the unofficial Triangle Area (''Trekantområde''), is rich in industry, business, and the [[service sector]]. Historically speaking, industry has been very important for the city's development, while today more weight is placed on business and service, as well as high-tech firms.

===Industry===
During the [[Industrial Revolution]], Vejle was known as the "Manchester of Denmark"<ref name="ddbs" /> due to its extensive [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|textile mill]]s.  The local rivers provided water power to mills, including the extensive facilities of De Danske Bomuldsspinderier (The Danish Cotton Mills).  In the first half of the 20th century, Vejle was something of a behemoth within the Danish textile industry, with some 25% of the city's workers employed in the industry.<ref name="ddbs" />
Despite the decline in the industry in Denmark, the last cotton mill in Vejle remained open until 1993.  Today, many of the old mill buildings are used for art studios, office space, and, more recently, apartments.

In 1975 United Trailer Factories was founded by brothers Niels and Jens Buhl. The company, now known as ‘Variant’ like its products, has grown in strength to become one of the biggest quality trailer manufacturers in Europe.

Later on, newer industries took root in Vejle.  The city is home to one of the largest chewing gum factories in the world, producing [[Stimorol]] brand chewing gum.

The Tulip slaughterhouses were also an important employer in the city.  Today, Tulip has closed its factory at the harbour, but still maintains production in northern Vejle.

Today, Vejle's economy is shifting out of the industrial sector and into the high-tech sector, with a number of software companies operating out of the city.

===Shopping===
[[File:Strøget i Vejle.JPG|thumb|Vejle's pedestrian street]]
Vejle is known regionally as a vibrant shopping town with a wide and varied offering of both chain and specialty shops, primarily located along the city's central pedestrian street.  Recently, in an effort to maintain its position as a premiere shopping destination, the town has invested in several public works projects to improve the city's appearance, including lengthening the [[Pedestrian Street]], developing new public art and architecture, and uncovering and beautifying Grejs River, which until recently ran in a culvert underneath downtown.

[[File:Bryggen i Vejle.JPG|thumb|The [[:da:Bryggen_(indkøbscenter)|Bryggen]] shopping centre]]
In addition to the shopping experiences in the city, Vejle also has its own shopping centre, the [[:da:Bryggen_(indkøbscenter)|Bryggen shopping centre]], located in the center of the city. The shopping centre contains 38 stores and two restaurants and lies within the pedestrian street.

Street food concepts can also be experience at the Paladspassagen Social Dining at the former Mary's Shoppingcenter.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Vejle Municipality}}
[[File:Vejle_Raadhus.JPG|thumb|[[Vejle City Hall]]]]
Vejle is located in and is the seat of [[Vejle Municipality]] which in its current configuration was formed under the [[Municipalities_of_Denmark#Municipal_Reform_2007|Municipal Reform of 2007]]. Vejle's municipal council consists of 31 members, elected every four years.

Ever since [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrat]] Christian Jacobsen became Vejle's first elected mayor in 1919, the town has been a stronghold for the Social Democrats and trade unions. The longest serving Social Democratic mayor was Willy Sørensen, a union leader who joined the city council in 1937 and held the mayor's post for 31 years, from 1946 until his death in 1978.<ref name="stadsarkiv" />

In 1993, the Social Democratic dynasty was broken, when a candidate from a coalition of opposition parties, Flemming Christiansen, became mayor.  In 2009, the Social Democrats were out of power again when [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberal]] candidate Arne Sigtenbjerggaard won the elections.<ref>[http://www.vejleamtsfolkeblad.dk/artikel/177920:Vejle--Vejle-faar-ny-borgmester Vejle får ny borgmester]</ref>

Several natives of Vejle have also made a career in national politics, including former Prime Minister [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]] (Liberal), the former Minister of the Treasury [[Troels Lund Poulsen]] (Liberal), former Minister of Health [[Torben Lund]] (Social Democrat), and former Minister of Transportation [[Flemming Hansen (politician)|Flemming Hansen]] ([[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative]]).

==Transportation and Infrastructure==

[[File:Vejlefjordbroen2.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Vejle Fjord Bridge]]]]
Historically speaking, Vejle's development has been guided by the city's central location in the country and its location on Vejle Fjord.  Vejle's pedestrian street today runs along the same course as some of the earliest paths through town<ref>See Zinglersen and Jürgensen: ''Vejles ældste gader'', {{ISBN|87-87683-23-7}} pp. 10 and 15 (''in Danish'')</ref> &ndash; glass panels set into Torvegade allow pedestrians to see the historical market road a few meters under the current street surface.

The [[European route E45]] motorway passes close to downtown Vejle on the [[Vejle Fjord Bridge]]. Vejle is also located on Primary Route 28, and the Mid-Jutland Highway (''Midjyske Motorvej'', Primary Route 18) from [[Herning]].<ref>[http://www.vejdirektoratet.dk/dokumentniveau.asp?page=document&objno=88558 Vejdirektoratets planlægning], Accessed June 29, 2008. (''in Danish'')</ref>

[[File:Vejle_Station_11.jpg|thumb|[[Vejle Transit Centre]]]]
Vejle Transit Centre ({{langx|da|Vejle Trafikcenter}}) is the principal transport hub for public transport in Vejle, which provides nine [[transit bus|city bus]] lines to various neighbourhoods, as well as national and international coach and [[DSB (railway company)|train services]]. [[Vejle railway station]] first opened in 1868,<ref>Jensen, Poul Ulrich: ''Byens plan - Vejles fysiske udvikling 1786-2007'', {{ISBN|87-90086-10-4}} pp. 54-56</ref> and is today a central station in the [[Rail transport in Denmark|Danish train network]]. However, the station is currently the subject of political debate, due to a desire on the part of some politicians to reduce train travel time between [[Odense]] and [[Århus]] to one hour.<ref>Landex, Alex, and Otto Anker Nielsen.  [http://www.dtf.dk/upload/institutter/ctt/pdf/rapporter/baneplan2007.pdf 6-by samarbejdet - om hurtigere tog mellem byerne].  November 2006.  Accessed October 26, 2008. (''in Danish'')</ref>  This may mean that a second bridge will be built over Vejle Fjord, bypassing Vejle Station.

[[File:Vejle Havn 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Port of Vejle]] in 2020]]

The [[Port of Vejle]], in its current location, was inaugurated in 1827.<ref name="stadsarkiv"/><ref>Sandbeck, Thorkild: "Vejle Havn 175 år" in ''Vejlebogen 2002'' {{ISBN|87-90086-29-5}} pp. 19-24</ref> In the years following [[World War II]], it grew to become the second largest port in [[Denmark]] after the [[Port of Copenhagen]]. Up until 1932, the [[steamboat]]s Hvidbjerg (named after a local seaside community) and Jeppe Jensen (named after the harbour's founder) plied the waters between Vejle Harbour and Munkebjerg, Tirsbæk, Ulbækhus, and Fakkegrav.<ref>Jensen, Poul Ulrich: ''Byens plan - Vejles fysiske udvikling 1786-2007'', {{ISBN|87-90086-10-4}} p. 151 (''in Danish'')</ref> The harbour is currently profitable, although there are plans to convert the northern section of the harbour into a park and residential area, which would reconnect the town with the fjord.

Vejle Municipality is part-owner of Denmark's second-largest airport, [[Billund Airport]], located near the [[Lego Group]]'s headquarters some {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=off}} from the centre of Vejle.  Airport buses run regularly to Billund Airport from Vejle Transit Centre.

==Environment==

[[File:Albuen Strand i Vejle.JPG|thumb|Albuen Beach]]
A central point of Vejle's environmental policy since 1985 has been the sorting of garbage into non-compostable and [[compost|compostable waste]], which is then composted in the city dump.  To this end, residents must place all household trash into either black or green bags.<ref>[http://www.affaldgenbrug.vejle.dk/page31692.aspx How to sort into green and black] on [http://www.vejle.dk vejle.dk](''in Danish'')</ref>

Vejle Municipality has also begun a range of nature restoration projects.  The most ambitious of these has been the restoration of the Kongens Kær [[wetlands]] around the Vejle River just outside the city limits.  The city has also undertaken a project to establish two new public beaches for swimming, Albuen and Tirsbæk Strand.<ref>[http://vejle.dk/page21833.aspx Water and Nature Projects] (''in Danish'')</ref>

==Education==
[[File:UCL Erhvervsakademi og Professionshøjskole, Vejle 2022.jpg|thumb|[[UCL University College]]]]
Vejle is home to the headquarters of University College Lillebælt, which is a merger of several educational institutions in East Jutland and Funen.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ucl.dk/content/dk2/welcome_to_university_college_lillebalt/about_us |title=About University College Lillebælt |access-date=2011-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115045544/http://www.ucl.dk/content/dk2/welcome_to_university_college_lillebalt/about_us |archive-date=2011-01-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Adult and professional education is available in Vejle through the [[Region of Southern Denmark]], the Folkeuniversitet (Adult Education Centre), the [[Vejle Idrætshøjskole]] (Athletics Professional College), and Skolen for Gastronomi, Musik & Design (School for Gastronomy, Music, and Design).

On the [[Secondary education in Denmark|secondary education]] level, Vejle offers several options: Vejle Handelsskole (Vejle Business School) offers business and professional programs; Vejle Tekniske Gymnasium (Vejle Technical School) offers vocational and technical education; and Rødkilde Gymnasium (on the fjord) and Rosborg Gymnasium offer [[gymnasium (Denmark)|academic programs]] with concentrations in language and science.

On the [[Danish Folkeskole Education|primary level]], Vejle has 11 regular primary schools (''folkeskoler''), 2 independent schools (''friskoler''), and 5 private schools (''privatskoler'') &ndash; one secular, one [[Protestant]], one [[Catholic]], one [[Islam]]ic and one [[Waldorf education|Waldorf-Steiner method]] school &ndash; as well as 2 schools for [[special needs]] students.  Unique to Vejle is a special program for athletically talented students starting in late primary school and continuing through Vejle Handelsskole.

==Sports==
[[File:Vejle Stadium.gif|thumb|right|Crowd at a Vejle Boldklub game at Vejle Stadium]]

The city's traditional [[association football|football]] club, [[Vejle Boldklub]] (Vejle Football Club), has won the [[Danish Superliga]] Championships five times and the [[Danish Cup]] six times. Vejle Boldklub has trained many talented football players, among others one of Danish football history's few international stars: [[Allan Simonsen]], who in 1977 became the first Danish player to win the [[European Footballer of the Year]] award. Today, Vejle Boldklub is in a ramping-up period, with the goal of bringing the club back to the top of Danish football. To this end, new [[Vejle Stadium]] was opened in spring 2008.

Vejle's largest indoor sports facilities are mostly housed in the DGI-Huset recreational centre in western Vejle.  In the past, the facility has housed several high-profile events, including the [[European Women's Handball Championship]] and the [[Denmark Open|Danish Open]] in [[badminton]].

Former [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[road bicycle racing|cyclist]] [[Tony Rominger]] was born in Vejle, and cyclist [[Bjarne Riis]] has a house in Vejle. Denmark's answer to the [[Tour de France]], [[Danmark Rundt]], includes a stretch through Vejle which is known as the hardest stage in the race, including a loop that requires the riders to climb the hillsides of Vejle several times. The race's winner is usually determined in the Vejle stage. Stage 3 of the [[2022 Tour de France]] started in Vejle.

==Arts and attractions==
[[File:Byparken i Vejle 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Vejle Music Hall (''Vejle Musikteater'')]]
In the arts, the most well-known personality from Vejle is composer [[Jacob Gade]], who wrote the [[Tango Jalousie]].  Other artists include author [[Ulrik Gräs]], priest and historial [[Anders Sørensen Vedel]], poet [[Inger Christensen]], artist [[Albert Bertelsen]], and actress [[Bodil Jørgensen]].

In the early and mid-20th century, Vejle had several popular cultural destinations such as Trædballehus in the western part of town and the Munkebjerg Casino south of the fjord.

Trædballehus, an inn and music venue, which burned down in 1954, got its big breakthrough in the mid-1930s when it was featured on [[DR (broadcaster)|Danish National Radio]] in connection with the opening of the [[Little Belt Bridge|old Little Belt Bridge]]. 1933 Hotel Munkebjerg boasted [[Europe]]'s longest wooden [[escalator]], carrying guests from the fjord-side beach up to the hilltop [[casino]]. Munkebjerg still exists as a hotel, casino and conference centre.

[[File:Sc09 Tanska -Vejle Vindmølle C P.jpg|230px|thumb|left|Vejle's windmill]]
[[File:VejleVorFrelsers.jpg|thumb|Our Saviour's Church (''Vor Frelsers Kirke'')]]
Vejle Mill, located on top of the cliff at Søndermarken, is a well-known landmark because of its visibility, and is often used as a symbol of the city.

The Old Jail House in Vejle, which is connected to the Town Hall, was rebuilt in 1984 and received a prize for beautification.{{cn|date=September 2023}}

Vejle's oldest extant building, [[St. Nicolai Church]], was built in the mid-13th century.  On display in the church is the [[Haraldskær Woman|Haraldskær bog woman]], a body from the [[Iron Age]] that was preserved with its skin intact in a local [[peat]] [[bog]].  Another feature of the church are 23 spherical indentations on the north transept &ndash; legend says these are imprints of the skulls of executed robbers from the woods that surround Vejle.{{cn|date=September 2023}}

Among the city's cultural institutions is the renovated and expanded [[Vejle Museum of Art]]. The museum features the Wörzner collection with several [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]] works as well as works by [[Rembrandt]]. Today, [[Vejle Town Museum]] is located in the renovated Spinning Mill.

[[File:Marys shoppingcenter.JPG|thumb|The former Mary's shopping centre]]
[[File:Økolariet i Vejle.JPG|thumb|right|Økolariet ecology-focused educational centre]]
The Socialists' former stronghold in Vejle, The Building, is today placed under glass in what used to be the shopping center "Mary's", and houses restaurants, cafés and two venues for e.g. jazz concerts. [[Økolariet]] is a free [[edutainment]] center for both children and adults, focusing on technology, ecology, recycling, etc.

Vejle is situated close to several [[Jutland]] attractions such as the [[Legoland Billund|original Legoland]] and the [[Viking Age]] royal capital of [[Jelling]].  Jelling's archaeological artifacts are considered a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], and include two 10th century [[rune stone]]s and two [[burial mound]]s, as well as a new exhibition centre.
