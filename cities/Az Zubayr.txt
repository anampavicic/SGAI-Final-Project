'''Az Zubayr''' ({{langx|ar|الزبير}}) is a city in and the capital of [[Al-Zubair District]], part of the [[Basra Governorate]] of [[Iraq]]. The city is just south of [[Basra]].

==History of Zubayr==

===Early history===
[[File:049 Street in Zubaire - USACE-p15141coll5-9423.jpeg|thumb|left|ca. 1942 street scene in Az Zubayr]]

The city was named al-Zubair because one of the [[Sahaba]] (companions) of [[Muhammad]], [[Zubayr ibn al-Awwam]], was buried there.{{Citation needed|date=October 2024}}

===21st century===
By 2008, the city of Zubair had a population of around 240,000 people and had grown to merge into the [[Basra]] metropolitan area with nearly 3 million inhabitants in total. As in Basra, the municipality of Zubair currently has a Shia majority and is barely distinguishable from Basra itself. But, contrary to Basra, Zubair is still home to a large Sunni minority. However, they have faced violence from Shia militants during the [[Iraqi civil war (2006–2008)|Iraqi Civil War]], and many have fled to Gulf countries and Sunni areas of Iraq.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/security/2013/09/iraq-sectarian-displacement-basra.html |title=Southern Iraq Swept By Sectarian Displacement - Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East |website=www.al-monitor.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927035544/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/security/2013/09/iraq-sectarian-displacement-basra.html |archive-date=2013-09-27}}</ref>
