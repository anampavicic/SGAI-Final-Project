==History==
[[Image: Arly Tourists in Birjand.jpg|thumb|left|Cossacks in Birjand, circa 1909.]]

The first citation of the city in the historical literature belongs to the famous book ''[[Mu'jam Al-Buldan|Mojem Alboldan]]'', by [[Yaqut al-Hamawi|Yaqut Homavi]] (13th century) which introduces the Birjand as the most beautiful town in the Qohestan. Before this, Birjand had been probably not as big and important as a municipality but rather as a rural community. However, the Birjand geographical area had its historical and political importance long before the emergence of the city of Birjand. Many citations of the region are available in the original literature like ''Ehya -ol- Molook'' of the once important localities in the area. Apart from literature, the oldest evidence on the history of the region is the ancient [[Lakh Mazar|Lakh-Mazar]] inscription in the Kooch village some {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} southeast of Birjand. Numerous fine drawings and inscriptions are carved on an igneous rock surface. The inscriptions include pictograms as well as [[Arsacid Pahlavi]], [[Sasanian Pahlavi]], [[Arabic]] and [[Persian alphabet|Persian]] scripts.<ref>Research articles collection (archaeology, ancient inscriptions): Lakh-Mazar, Birjand. Rajab Ali Labbaf Khaniki, Rassul Bashash Kanzaq. 25. Iranian Cultural Heritage Organization. Summer 1994.</ref>

In 1931, Birjand Municipality was opened under the name of Birjand Municipality next to the tomb of Hakim Nazari and started its activities with 12 employees. The first mayor of Birjand was Mr. Afshar, who served as mayor for six years.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2008-11-21 |title=New Page 1 |url=http://www.birjandcity.com/Negin/html/fasl7.htm |access-date=2022-01-28 |website= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121033731/http://www.birjandcity.com/Negin/html/fasl7.htm |archive-date=21 November 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
