'''Rajpur Sonarpur''' ({{IPA|bn|ɾɑːd͡ʒpuɾ soːnɑːɾpuɾ|lang}}) is  a municipality of the [[South 24 Parganas]] district in the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[West Bengal]]. It is a part of the area covered by the [[Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority]] (KMDA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmdaonline.com/kma.html|title=Base Map of Kolkata Metropolitan Area|access-date=3 September 2007|publisher=Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928000049/http://www.cmdaonline.com/kma.html|archive-date=28 September 2007}}</ref> Rajpur and Sonarpur are two separate towns. Since the formation of the municipality, these twin towns are known together as Rajpur Sonarpur.

==History==
Many ''[[janapadas]]'' grew up along the old [[Hooghly River|Bhagirathi]] channel from the ancient times till around the 16th century: [[Kalighat]], Boral, Rajpur, [[Harinavi]], Mahinagar, [[Baruipur]], [[Baharu]], [[Jaynagar Majilpur]], [[Majilpur]], [[Chhatrabhog]] etc. [[Bipradas Pipilai]]'s ''Manasavijaya'', composed in 1495, mentions many places in this region. "[[Chand Sadagar]], a merchant character of the ''Manasavijay'', reached Baruipur, from Kalighat, through the old Bhagirathi channel. From there he proceeded towards Chhatrabhog, and then traveling through Hatiagarh pargana reached the open sea". [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitanyadeva]] (1486–1534) also went through this route. Travelling by boat to [[Puri]] he halted at the village of Atisara, near Baruipur. "His last stoppage in [[24 Parganas]] was at Chhatrabhog, now a village within the jurisdiction of the [[Mathurapur, South 24 Parganas|Mathurapur]] police station. Chhatrabhog seems to have been an important river-port on the old Bhagirathi channel". Rama Chandra Khan, the ''[[zamindar]]'' of Chhatrabhog, helped Chaitanyadeva to continue with his journey.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://wbplan.gov.in/HumanDev/DHDR/24%20pgsSouth/s24prg_main.htm | title = District Human Development Report: South 24 Parganas |work= Pages 3-4, Chapter I: South 24 Parganas: An overview| publisher =  Department of Planning and Statistics, Government of West Bengal |access-date =  15 December 2019|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161005044029/http://wbplan.gov.in/HumanDev/DHDR/24%20pgsSouth/s24prg_main.htm | archive-date = 5 October 2016 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

The area was home to the feudatory landlords (''zamindars''). The name Rajpur has been thus derived from the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] words ''Rajar Puri'' to ''Rajpuri'' and in this form to the now Rajpur. Being on the banks of the [[Adi Ganga]], Rajpur was one of the major locations of [[Bengal]] at that time. The proximity to [[Kolkata]]'s southern district and being on the banks of Adi Ganga, which is just across the river made the place to be well connected. The old zamindar's house in Rajpur Harinavi is like the Roy Choudhury's. The family stayed in Rajpur. The ancestral houses of [[Sarat Chandra Bose]] and [[Subhash Chandra Bose]] were at Kodalia, a neighbourhood in Rajpur. Both of them were members of the first 24 Parganas District Committee of the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]], which was formed in 1921.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://wbplan.gov.in/HumanDev/DHDR/24%20pgsSouth/s24prg_main.htm | title = District Human Development Report: South 24 Parganas |work= Page 7, Chapter I: South 24 Parganas: An overview| publisher =  Department of Planning and Statistics, Government of West Bengal |access-date =  15 December 2019|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161005044029/http://wbplan.gov.in/HumanDev/DHDR/24%20pgsSouth/s24prg_main.htm | archive-date = 5 October 2016 | url-status = dead }}</ref>
