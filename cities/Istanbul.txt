The city served as an imperial capital for almost 1600 years: during the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] (330–1204), [[Latin Empire|Latin]] (1204–1261), [[Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty|late Byzantine]] (1261–1453), and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] (1453–1922) empires.{{sfn|Çelik|1993|p=xv}} The city grew in size and influence, eventually becoming a beacon of the [[Silk Road]] and one of the most important cities in history. The city played a key role in the advancement of Christianity during Roman/Byzantine times, hosting four of the [[first seven ecumenical councils]] before its transformation to an Islamic stronghold following the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 CE—especially after becoming the seat of the [[Ottoman Caliphate]] in 1517.<ref name="maag1145">{{harvnb|Masters|Ágoston|2009|pp=114–15}}</ref> In 1923, after the [[Turkish War of Independence]], [[Ankara]] replaced the city as the capital of the newly formed Republic of Turkey.

The first known name of the city is ''[[Byzantium]]'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Βυζάντιον}} {{lang|grc-Latn|Byzántion}}), the name given to it at its foundation by [[Megarian]] colonists around 657 BCE.<ref name="Britannica-Istanbul"/><ref name="roo177">{{harvnb|Room|2006|p=177}}</ref> Megarian colonists claimed a direct line back to the founders of the city, Byzas, the son of the god Poseidon and the nymph Ceroëssa.<ref name="roo177"/> Modern excavations have raised the possibility that the name Byzantium might reflect the sites of native [[Thracian]] settlements that preceded the fully-fledged town.{{sfn|Georgacas|1947|p=352ff}} [[Constantinople]] comes from the Latin name {{langr|la|Constantinus}}, after [[Constantine the Great]], the Roman emperor who refounded the city in 324 CE.<ref name="roo177"/> Constantinople remained the most common name for the city in the West until the 1930s, when Turkish authorities began to press for the use of "Istanbul" ({{langx|tr|İstanbul}}{{Efn|{{IPA|tr|isˈtanbuɫ||Istanbul pronunciation.ogg}}}}) in foreign languages. {{lang|ota-Latn|Ḳosṭanṭīnīye}} ({{langx|ota|قسطنطينيه}}) and {{lang|tr|İstanbul}} were the names used alternatively by the Ottomans during their rule.{{sfn|Necipoğlu|2010|p=262}}

The name {{lang|tr|İstanbul}} ({{langx|ota|استانبول}}) ({{IPA|tr|isˈtanbuɫ|audio=Istanbul pronunciation.ogg}} <small>colloquial</small> {{IPA|tr|ɯsˈtambuɫ}}) is commonly held to derive from the [[Medieval Greek]] phrase {{lang|grc|εἰς τὴν [[Polis|Πόλιν]]}} ({{IPA-el|is tim ˈbolin}}), literally 'to the city'<ref>Necdet Sakaoğlu (1993/94a): "İstanbul'un adları" ["The names of Istanbul"]. In: ''Dünden bugüne İstanbul ansiklopedisi'', ed. Türkiye Kültür Bakanlığı, Istanbul.</ref> and is how Constantinople was referred to by the local Greeks. This reflected its status as the only major city in the vicinity. The importance of Constantinople in the Ottoman world was also reflected by its nickname {{lang|tr|Dersaadet}} ({{langx|ota|درساعدت}}) meaning the 'Gate to Prosperity' in Ottoman Turkish.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Grosvenor |first1=Edwin Augustus |title=Constantinople |date=1895 |publisher=Roberts Brothers |volume=1 |page=69 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGoLAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA69 |access-date=15 March 2021}}</ref> An alternative view is that the name evolved directly from "Constantinople", with the first and third syllables dropped.<ref name="roo177"/> Some Ottoman sources of the 17th century, such as [[Evliya Çelebi]], describe it as the common Turkish name of the time; between the late 17th and late 18th centuries, it was also in official use. The first use of the word {{lang|ota-Latn|Islambol}} ({{langx|ota|اسلامبول}}) on coinage was in 1730 during the reign of Sultan [[Mahmud I]].{{sfn|Finkel|2005|pp=57, 383}} In modern [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the name is written as {{lang|tr|İstanbul}}, with a dotted İ, as the [[Turkish alphabet]] distinguishes between a [[İ|dotted]] and [[dotless I]]. In English the stress is on the first or last syllable, but in Turkish it is on the second syllable ({{lang|tr|-tan-}}).{{sfn|Göksel|Kerslake|2005|p=27}} A person from the city is an {{lang|tr|İstanbullu}} (plural {{lang|tr|İstanbullular}}); ''Istanbulite'' is used in English.{{sfn|Keyder|1999|p=95}}

The history of the city proper begins around 660 BCE,<ref name="Britannica-Istanbul"/>{{sfn|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=1}}{{efn|name=byz-date|The foundation of Byzantion ([[Byzantium]]) is sometimes, especially in encyclopedic or other tertiary sources, placed firmly in 667 BCE.

Even if the number of deaths (estimated at thirty-seven) among members of the Greek community was relatively low, the result of the pogrom was the flight and emigration of the Greek minority of Istanbul, which once numbered some 100,000 and was subsequently reduced to a few thousand. The vast destruction of Greek property, businesses, and churches provides evidence of the Turkish authorities’ intent to terrorize the Greeks in Istanbul into abandoning the territory, thus eliminating the Greek minority. This practice falls within the ambit of the crime of ‘‘ethnic cleansing,’’ which the UN General Assembly and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia have interpreted as constituting a form of genocide... Besides the deaths, thousands were injured; some 200 Greek women were raped, and there are reports that Greek boys were raped as well. Many Greek men, including at least one priest, were subjected to forced circumcision. The riots were accompanied by enormous material damage, estimated by Greek authorities at US$500 million, including the burning of churches and the devastation of shops and private homes.

Despite the generally acceptable temperature range, mid-summer in Istanbul is considered moderately uncomfortable, due to high dew points and relative humidity.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal |last1=Abbasnia |first1=Mohsen |last2=Toros |first2=Hüseyin |last3=Memarian |first3=Hadi |date=2019 |title=Analysis of Climate in the Megacity of Istanbul Based on Human Bioclimatic Comfort Index |url=https://avesis.itu.edu.tr/yayin/26af2d5e-0c30-4b5d-83a5-9ffe2be7a179/analysis-of-climate-in-the-megacity-of-istanbul-based-on-human-bioclimatic-comfort-index |journal=Journal of Research in Atmospheric Science |volume=1 |issue=1 |issn=0000-0000}}</ref> Winters, meanwhile, are cool, quite rainy, and relatively snow-rich for a city with above-freezing average temperatures.

Istanbul's precipitation is unevenly distributed, with winter months getting at least twice the level of precipitation of their summerly counterparts. The mode of precipitation also varies by season. Winter precipitation is generally light, persistent and often of mixed precipitation such as [[Rain and snow mixed|rain-snow mixes]] and [[graupel]]; while summer precipitation is generally abrupt and sporadic. Cloudiness, as with precipitation, varies greatly by season. Winters are quite cloudy, with around 20 percent of days being sunny or partly cloudy. Meanwhile, summers experience 60-70 percent of possible sunshine.

Snowfall is sporadic, but accumulates virtually every winter; and when it does, it is highly disruptive to city infrastructure. [[Lake-effect snow|Sea-effect snowstorms]] with more than {{Convert|30|cm|ft|sigfig=1}} of snowfall happen almost annually, most recently in [[Storm Elpis|2022]].<ref name=":10">{{cite web |title=La neve sulle coste del Mediterraneo |url=http://www.nimbus.it/liguria/rlm44/neve_mediterraneo.htm |access-date=28 April 2021 |website=www.nimbus.it}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=İstanbul'da bazı ilçelerde kar kalınlığı 85 santimetreyi buldu |url=https://www.birgun.net/haber/istanbul-da-bazi-ilcelerde-kar-kalinligi-85-santimetreyi-buldu-374544 |website=www.birgun.net}}</ref><!-- Do not replace weatherbox with other data without consensus, per earlier discussions on talk page. -->{{Weather box

The [[Fatih]] district, which was named after Mehmed II ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Fatih Sultan Mehmed''), corresponds to what was the whole of Constantinople until the Ottoman conquest; today it is the capital district and called the ''historic peninsula'' of Istanbul on the southern shore of the [[Golden Horn]], across the medieval [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] citadel of [[Galata]] on the northern shore. The Genoese fortifications in Galata were largely demolished in the 19th century, leaving only the [[Galata Tower]], to make way for the northward expansion of the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Çelik|1993|pp=70, 169}}</ref> Galata ([[Karaköy]]) is today a quarter within the Beyoğlu district, which forms Istanbul's commercial and entertainment center and includes [[İstiklal Avenue]] and [[Taksim Square]].<ref>{{harvnb|Çelik|1993|p=127}}</ref>

[[Dolmabahçe Palace]], the seat of government during the late Ottoman period, is in the [[Beşiktaş]] district on the European shore of the Bosporus, to the north of Beyoğlu. The former village of [[Ortaköy]] is within Beşiktaş and gives its name to the [[Ortaköy Mosque]] on the Bosporus, near the [[Bosporus Bridge]].

During the Ottoman period, [[Üsküdar]] (then Scutari) and [[Kadıköy]] were outside the scope of the urban area, serving as tranquil outposts with seaside ''yalıs'' and gardens. But in the second half of the 20th century, the Asian side experienced major urban growth; the late development of this part of the city led to better infrastructure and tidier urban planning when compared with most other residential areas in the city.{{sfn|WCTR Society|Unʼyu Seisaku Kenkyū Kikō|2004|p=281}} Much of the Asian side of the Bosporus functions as a suburb of the economic and commercial centers in European Istanbul, accounting for a third of the city's population but only a quarter of its employment.{{sfn|WCTR Society|Unʼyu Seisaku Kenkyū Kikō|2004|p=281}} However, [[Kozyatağı]]–[[Ataşehir]], [[Altunizade]], [[Beykoz|Kavacık]] and [[Ümraniye]], all together having around 1.4 million sqm of class-A office space, are now important "[[edge cities]]", i.e. corridors and nodes of business and shopping centers and of tall residential buildings.<ref name=property2021/>

===Parks===
[[File:Yildiz Park 02.jpg|thumb|[[Yıldız Park]] connects [[Yıldız Palace]] to [[Çırağan Palace]]]]

Istanbul does not have a primary urban park, but it has several green areas. [[Gülhane Park]] and [[Yıldız Park]] were originally included within the grounds of two of Istanbul's palaces — Topkapı Palace and [[Yıldız Palace]]—but they were repurposed as public parks in the early decades of the Turkish Republic.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyar|Fleet|2010|p=247}}</ref> Another park, [[Fethi Paşa Korusu]], is on a hillside adjacent to the Bosphorus Bridge in Anatolia, opposite Yıldız Palace in Europe.

Along the European side, and close to the [[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge]], is [[Emirgan Park]], which was known as the ''Kyparades'' ('Cypress Forest') during the Byzantine period. In the Ottoman period, it was first granted to [[Lord Chancellor|Nişancı]] [[Feridun Ahmed Bey]] in the 16th century, before being granted by Sultan [[Murad IV]] to the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] emir Gûne Han in the 17th century, hence the name ''Emirgan''. The {{convert|47|ha|acre|adj=on}} park was later owned by Khedive [[Isma'il Pasha]] of [[Khedivate of Egypt|Ottoman Egypt]] in the 19th century. Emirgan Park is known for its diversity of plants and an annual [[tulip]] festival is held there since 2005.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=241}}</ref>

The [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] government's decision to replace [[Taksim Gezi Park]] with a replica of the Ottoman era [[Taksim Military Barracks]] (which was transformed into the [[Taksim Stadium]] in 1921, before being demolished in 1940 for building Gezi Park) sparked a series of [[Gezi Park protests|nationwide protests in 2013]] covering a wide range of issues.

Popular during the summer among Istanbulites is [[Belgrad Forest]], spreading across {{convert|5500|ha|acre|adj=off}} at the northern edge of the city. The forest originally supplied water to the city and remnants of reservoirs used during Byzantine and Ottoman times survive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/belge/2-14846/water-supply-systems-reservoirs-charity-and-free-founta-.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119053754/http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/belge/2-14846/water-supply-systems-reservoirs-charity-and-free-founta-.html|archive-date=19 November 2010 |publisher=Republic of Turkey Ministry of Culture and Tourism|title=Water Supply Systems, Reservoirs, Charity and Free Fountains, Turkish Baths|access-date=29 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Time Out Guides|2010|p=212}}</ref>

Istanbul is primarily known for its Byzantine and Ottoman architecture. Despite its development as a Turkish city since 1923, it contains many ancient, Roman, Byzantine, Christian, Muslim, and Jewish monuments.

The Neolithic settlement in the [[Yenikapı]] quarter on the European side, which dates back to {{c.|6500 BCE}} and predates the formation of the Bosporus by approximately a millennium, when the Sea of Marmara was still a lake,{{citation needed|date=April 2024}} was discovered during the construction of the [[Marmaray]] railway tunnel.<ref name="BBC-Rainsford-2009">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7820924.stm|title=Istanbul's ancient past unearthed|website=www.bbc.com|publisher=BBC|first=Sarah|last=Rainsford|date=10 January 2009|accessdate=29 May 2021}}</ref> It is the oldest known human settlement on the European side of the city.<ref name="BBC-Rainsford-2009"/> The oldest known human settlement on the Asian side is the Fikirtepe Mound near Kadıköy, with relics dating to the [[Chalcolithic]] period {{circa|5500|3500&nbsp;BCE}}.

There are numerous ancient monuments in the city.<ref name="coaot"/> The most ancient is the [[Obelisk]] of [[Thutmose III]] ([[Obelisk of Theodosius]]).<ref name="coaot"/> Built of red granite, 31&nbsp;m (100&nbsp;ft) high, it came from the [[Karnak|Temple of Karnak]] in [[Luxor]], and was erected there by [[Pharaoh]] Thutmose III ({{reign|1479|1425 BCE}}) to the south of the seventh [[pylon (architecture)|pylon]].<ref name="coaot"/> The Roman emperor [[Constantius II]] ({{reign|337–361 CE}}) had it and another obelisk transported along the [[Nile]] to [[Alexandria]] for commemorating his ''ventennalia'' or 20 years on the throne in 357. The other obelisk was erected on the ''[[spina (Roman circus)|spina]]'' of the [[Circus Maximus]] in Rome in the autumn of that year, and is now known as the [[Lateran Obelisk]]. The obelisk that would become the ''Obelisk of Theodosius'' remained in Alexandria until 390, when Theodosius I ({{reign|379|395}}) had it transported to Constantinople and put up on the ''spina'' of the Hippodrome there.<ref name = Habachi>[[#LH|Labib Habachi]], ''The Obelisks of Egypt, skyscrapers of the past'', American University in Cairo Press, 1985, p.145-151.</ref> When re-erected at the Hippodrome of Constantinople, the obelisk was mounted on a decorative base, with [[relief]]s that depict Theodosius I and his courtiers.<ref name="coaot">{{harvnb|Chamber of Architects of Turkey|2006|pp=80, 118}}</ref> The lower part of the obelisk was damaged in antiquity, probably during its transport to Alexandria in 357 CE or during its re-erection at the Hippodrome of Constantinople in 390 CE. As a result, the current height of the obelisk is only 18.54 meters, or 25.6 meters if the base is included. Between the four corners of the obelisk and the pedestal are four bronze cubes, used in its transportation and re-erection.<ref name = Wallis>[[#WB|E.A.

Built in [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] and erected at the center of the [[Forum of Constantine]] in 330 CE to mark the founding of the new Roman capital, the [[Column of Constantine]] was originally adorned with a sculpture of the Roman emperor Constantine the Great depicted as the solar god [[Apollo]] on its top, which fell in 1106 and was later replaced by a cross during the reign of Byzantine emperor [[Manuel Komnenos]] (r. 1143–1180).<ref name="Forum of Constantine"/><ref name="coaot"/>

There are traces of the Byzantine era throughout the city, from ancient churches that were built over early Christian meeting places like the [[Hagia Irene]], the [[Chora Church]], the [[Monastery of Stoudios]], the [[Little Hagia Sophia|Church of Sts. Sergius and Bacchus]], the [[Pammakaristos Church|Church of Theotokos Pammakaristos]], the [[Zeyrek Mosque|Monastery of the Pantocrator]], the [[Eski Imaret Mosque|Monastery of Christ Pantepoptes]], the [[Gül Mosque|Hagia Theodosia]], the [[Kalenderhane Mosque|Church of Theotokos Kyriotissa]], the [[Fenari Isa Mosque|Monastery of Constantine Lips]], the [[Bodrum Mosque|Church of Myrelaion]], the [[Church-Mosque of Vefa|Hagios Theodoros]], etc.; to palaces like the Great Palace of Constantinople and its [[Great Palace Mosaic Museum|Mosaic Museum]], the [[Palace of the Porphyrogenitus]], [[Boukoleon Palace]] and [[Palace of Blachernae]]; and other public places and buildings like the Hippodrome, the [[Augustaion]], the [[Basilica Cistern]], [[Theodosius Cistern]], [[Cistern of Philoxenos]] and [[Cistern of the Hebdomon]], the [[Aqueduct of Valens]], the [[Prison of Anemas]], the [[Walls of Constantinople]] and the [[Porta Aurea]] (Golden Gate), among numerous others. The 4th century [[Harbour of Eleutherios|Harbor of Theodosius]] in Yenikapı, once the busiest port in Constantinople, was among the numerous archeological discoveries that took place during the excavations of the Marmaray tunnel.<ref name="BBC-Rainsford-2009"/>

However, it is the Hagia Sophia that fully conveys the period of Constantinople as a city without parallel in [[Christendom]]. The Hagia Sophia, topped by a dome {{convert|31|m|ft|sp=us}} in diameter over a square space defined by four arches, is the pinnacle of [[Byzantine architecture]].<ref name="mangocyril">{{cite book |last1=Mango |first1=Cyril |title=Byzantine Architecture |date=1985 |publisher=Electa Editrice |location=Milan |isbn=978-0-8478-0615-7}}</ref> The Hagia Sophia stood as the world's largest cathedral in the world until it was converted into a mosque in the 15th century.<ref name="mangocyril"/> The minarets date from that period.<ref name="mangocyril"/> Because of its historical significance, it was reopened as a museum in 1935. However, it was re-converted into a mosque in July 2020.

Over the next four centuries, the Ottomans transformed Istanbul's urban landscape with a vast building scheme that included the construction of towering mosques and ornate palaces. The [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]] (Blue Mosque), another landmark of the city, faces the Hagia Sophia at Sultanahmet Square (Hippodrome of Constantinople). The [[Süleymaniye Mosque]], built by Suleiman the Magnificent, was designed by his chief architect Mimar Sinan, the most illustrious of all Ottoman architects, who designed many of the city's renowned mosques and other types of public buildings and monuments.<ref name="sinan-britannica">{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sinan|title=Sinan, Ottoman architect|date=8 April 2024 |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}</ref>

Areas around İstiklal Avenue were filled with grand European embassies and rows of buildings in Neoclassical, [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival]] and [[Art Nouveau]] styles, which went on to influence the architecture of a variety of structures in Beyoğlu—including churches, stores, and theaters—and official buildings such as Dolmabahçe Palace.<ref>{{harvnb|Çelik|1993|pp=133–34, 141}}</ref>

The current city structure can be traced back to the ''Tanzimat'' period of reform in the 19th century, before which [[qadi|Islamic judges]] and imams led the city under the auspices of the [[Grand Vizier]]. Following the model of French cities, this religious system was replaced by a mayor and a citywide council composed of representatives of the confessional groups (''[[millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]]'') across the city.

More recently, Istanbul and many of Turkey's metropolitan cities are following a trend away from the government and their right-wing ideology. In 2013 and 2014, large scale [[Gezi Park protests|anti-AKP government protests]] began in İstanbul and spread throughout the nation. This trend first became evident electorally in the [[2014 Istanbul mayoral election|2014 mayoral election]] where the center-left opposition candidate won an impressive 40% of the vote, despite not winning. The first government defeat in Istanbul occurred in the [[2017 Turkish constitutional referendum|2017 constitutional referendum]], where Istanbul voted 'No' by 51.4% to 48.6%. The AKP government had supported a 'Yes' vote and won the vote nationally due to high support in rural parts of the country. A major turning point for the government came in the 2019 local elections, where their candidate for Mayor, former Prime Minister [[Binali Yıldırım]], was defeated by a very narrow margin by the [[Republican People's Party]] candidate Ekrem İmamoğlu. İmamoğlu won the vote with 48.77% of the vote, against Yıldırım's 48.61%, but the elections were controversially annulled by the [[Supreme Electoral Council (Turkey)|Supreme Electoral Council]] due to AKP's claim of electoral fraud. In the re-run İmamoğlu gathered 54.22% of the total vote and widened his margin of victory.<ref>{{cite news|author=Isil Sariyuce and Ivana Kottasová|title=Istanbul election rerun set to be won by opposition, in blow to Erdogan|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/23/europe/turkey-istanbul-mayor-election-intl/index.html|website=CNN}}</ref>

Following the 2019 election, a trend towards the CHP has persisted across the city. In the [[2023 Turkish presidential election|2023 presidential election]] the CHP candidate, [[Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu]], received 48.56% of the city's vote, while the incumbent president and AKP candidate, [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], received 46.68%.

In the [[2024 Istanbul mayoral election|2024 local elections]], Ekrem İmamoğlu was re-elected by a 12-point margin. İmamoğlu won 51.15% of the vote, while the AKP's candidate [[Murat Kurum]] received 39.59%. Additionally, the CHP won the mayoralties in 26 of İstanbul's 39 districts.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Seçim 2024 |url=https://secim.aa.com.tr/ |access-date=2024-04-04 |website=secim.aa.com.tr |archive-date=14 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230514223153/https://secim.aa.com.tr// |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Istanbul was historically known as a cultural hub, but its cultural scene stagnated after the Turkish Republic shifted its focus toward Ankara.<ref>{{harvnb|Göktürk|Soysal|Türeli|2010|p=8}}</ref> The new national government established programs that served to orient Turks toward musical traditions, especially those originating in Europe, but musical institutions and visits by foreign classical artists were primarily centered in the new capital.<ref>{{harvnb|Reisman|2006|p=88}}</ref>

Much of Turkey's cultural scene had its roots in Istanbul, and by the 1980s and 1990s Istanbul reemerged globally as a city whose cultural significance is not solely based on its past glory.<ref>{{harvnb|Göktürk|Soysal|Türeli|2010|pp=2–4}}</ref>

By the end of the 19th century, Istanbul had established itself as a regional artistic center, with Turkish, European, and Middle Eastern artists flocking to the city. Despite efforts to make Ankara Turkey's cultural heart, Istanbul had the country's primary institution of art until the 1970s.<ref name="gosotu2213">{{harvnb|Göktürk|Soysal|Türeli|2010|pp=221–23}}</ref> When additional universities and art journals were founded in Istanbul during the 1980s, artists formerly based in Ankara moved in.<ref>{{harvnb|Göktürk|Soysal|Türeli|2010|pp=223–24}}</ref>

Beyoğlu has been transformed into the artistic center of the city, with young artists and older Turkish artists formerly residing abroad finding footing there. Modern art museums, including [[İstanbul State Art and Sculpture Museum]], [[National Palaces Painting Museum]], [[İstanbul Modern]], the [[Pera Museum]], [[Sakıp Sabancı Museum]], [[Arter (art center)|Arter]] and [[SantralIstanbul]], opened in the 2000s to complement the exhibition spaces and auction houses that have already contributed to the cosmopolitan nature of the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/magazine/istanbul-art-boom-bubble.html|work=The New York Times|title=The Istanbul Art-Boom Bubble|last=Hansen|first=Suzy|date=10 February 2012|access-date=19 April 2012}}</ref> These museums have yet to attain the popularity of older museums on the historic peninsula, including the Istanbul Archaeology Museums, which ushered in the era of modern museums in Turkey, and the [[Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum]].<ref name="kultur"/>

Coinciding with this cultural reemergence was the establishment of the Istanbul Festival, which began showcasing a variety of art from Turkey and around the world in 1973. From this flagship festival came the [[International Istanbul Film Festival]] and the [[Istanbul Jazz Festival]] in the early 1980s. With its focus now solely on music and dance, the Istanbul Festival has been known as the [[Istanbul International Music Festival]] since 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://muzik.iksv.org/en/thefestival/history|publisher=The Istanbul Foundation for Culture and Arts|title=History|access-date=13 April 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503092124/http://muzik.iksv.org/en/thefestival/history|archive-date=3 May 2011}}</ref> The most prominent of the festivals that evolved from the original Istanbul Festival is the [[Istanbul Biennial]], held every two years since 1987.

Istanbul is also famous for its sophisticated and elaborately-cooked dishes of the [[Ottoman cuisine]]. Following the influx of immigrants from southeastern and eastern Turkey, which began in the 1960s, the city's foodscape has drastically changed by the end of the century; with influences of Middle Eastern cuisine such as [[kebab]] taking an important place in the food scene.

Restaurants featuring foreign cuisines are mainly concentrated in the [[Beyoğlu]], [[Beşiktaş]], [[Şişli]] and [[Kadıköy]] districts.

Apart from the city's numerous stadiums, sports halls and concert halls, there are several open-air venues for concerts and festivals, such as the [[Cemil Topuzlu Open-Air Theatre]] in [[Şişli|Harbiye]], Paraf Kuruçeşme Open-Air on the Bosphorus shore in [[Kuruçeşme]], and Parkorman in the forest of [[Maslak]]. The annual [[Istanbul Jazz Festival]] has been held every year since 1994. Organized between 2003 and 2013, [[Rock'n Coke]] was the biggest open-air rock festival in Turkey, sponsored by Coca-Cola. It was traditionally held at the [[Hezarfen Airfield]] in Istanbul.

Most state-run radio and television stations are based in Ankara, but Istanbul is the primary hub of Turkish media. The industry has its roots in the former Ottoman capital, where the first Turkish newspaper, ''Takvim-i Vekayi'' (Calendar of Affairs), was published in 1831. The [[Cağaloğlu]] street on which the newspaper was printed, Bâb-ı Âli Street, rapidly became the center of Turkish print media, alongside Beyoğlu across the Golden Horn.<ref>{{harvnb|Brummett|2000|pp=11, 35, 385–86}}</ref>

Radio broadcasts in Istanbul date back to 1927, when Turkey's first radio transmission came from atop the Central Post Office in Eminönü.

===Airports===
Istanbul has had three large international airports, two of which currently serve commercial passenger flights. The largest is the new [[Istanbul Airport]], opened in 2018 in the [[Arnavutköy (district)|Arnavutköy]] district to the northwest of the city center, on the European side, near the Black Sea coast.

All scheduled commercial passenger flights were transferred from [[Atatürk Airport]] to Istanbul Airport on 6 April 2019, following the closure of Istanbul Atatürk Airport for scheduled passenger flights.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-airport/last-flight-leaves-ataturk-as-istanbul-switches-airports-idUSKCN1RI0CY|title=Last flight leaves Ataturk as Istanbul switches airports|website=Reuters|date=6 April 2019}}</ref> The [[IATA code]] IST was also transferred to the new airport.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://atwonline.com/airports-routes/turkish-airlines-relocates-new-istanbul-airport|title=Turkish Airlines relocates to new Istanbul Airport|publisher=ATWOnline|date=5 April 2019}}</ref> Once all phases are completed in 2025, the airport will have six sets of runways (eight in total), 16 taxiways, and will be able to accommodate 200&nbsp;million passengers a year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Turkish Airlines is switching to a new Istanbul airport – all in 45 hours|date=6 April 2019|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/apr/06/turkish-airlines-switching-to-new-airport-all-in-45-hours|work=The Guardian|access-date=13 April 2019|quote=The opening date has been pushed back three times, but authorities insist that the main terminal building and two runways will be fully operational by Sunday, in what critics say it is a rushed and dangerous attempt to stay on schedule.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ay|first1=Hasan|title=Havalimanı değil zafer anıtı|url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/Gundem/2014/06/08/havalimani-degil-zafer-aniti|website=sabah.com.tr|publisher=Sabah|access-date=8 June 2014}}</ref> The transfer from the airport to the city is via the O-7, and it will eventually be linked by two lines of the Istanbul Metro.

Istanbul Atatürk Airport, located {{convert|24|km|mi|sp=us}} west of the city center, on the European side, near the Marmara Sea coast, was formerly the city's largest airport. After its closure to commercial flights in 2019, it was briefly used by cargo aircraft and the official state aircraft owned by the Turkish government, until the demolition of its runway began in 2020. It handled {{nowrap|61.3 million}} passengers in 2015, which made it the [[List of the busiest airports in Europe|third-busiest airport in Europe]] and the [[world's busiest airports by passenger traffic|18th-busiest in the world]] in that year.<ref name="aci">{{cite web|url=http://www.aci.aero/Data-Centre/Monthly-Traffic-Data/Passenger-Summary/Year-to-date|publisher=Airports Council International|title=Preliminary 2013 World Airport Traffic and Rankings|date=17 March 2014|access-date=25 March 2014|archive-date=13 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813170044/http://www.aci.aero/Data-Centre/Monthly-Traffic-Data/Passenger-Summary/Year-to-date|url-status=dead}}</ref>
