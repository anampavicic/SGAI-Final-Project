==History==
The area around Abiko has been inhabited since [[Japanese Paleolithic]] times, and archaeologists have found [[stone tool]]s dated from 30,000 years ago. During the [[Edo period]], Abiko was a river port on the [[Tone River]] and a [[shukuba|post station]] on the ''Mito Kaidō'', a highway connecting [[Edo]] with [[Mito, Ibaraki|Mito]]. After the [[Meiji Restoration]], Abiko Town was created in [[Minamisoma District, Chiba|Minamisoma District]], Chiba Prefecture on April 1, 1889, along with the town of Fusa and village of Kohoku with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. Abiko was transferred to [[Higashikatsushika District, Chiba|Higashikatsushika District]] in 1897. From the [[Taisho period]] to the early [[Showa period]], Abiko was sometimes called "Kamakura in the north" as many prominent cultural figures such as [[Naoya Shiga]], [[Saneatsu Mushanokoji]], [[Soetsu Yanagi]], and [[Bernard Leach]] had villas in the town, which became a center for the [[Shirakabaha]] literary coterie. On November 1, 1954, it annexed neighboring Tomise village from the same district. On April 29, 1955, Abiko annexed Fusa Town and Kohoku Village. Abiko achieved city status on July 1, 1970. In 2003, a proposal to merge Abiko with neighboring city of Kashiwa and the town of [[Shōnan, Chiba|Shōnan]] was defeated by a public referendum.  Parts of the city were damaged by [[soil liquefaction]] due to the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]].

==Government==
Abiko has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 24 members. Abiko contributes two members to the Chiba Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of [[Chiba 8th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Although agriculture still plays a significant role in the local economy, Abiko is largely a regional commercial center and from the 1970s developed into a [[commuter town]] for nearby Chiba and Tokyo. The commuting rate is 32.3% for central Tokyo and 12.4% for Kashiwa City (both according to the 2010 census).

==Education==
===Universities===
*[[Chuo Gakuin University]]
*[[Kawamura Gakuen Women's University]]

===Primary and secondary education===
Abiko has 13 public elementary schools and six public middle schools operated by the city government, and two public high schools operated by the Chiba Prefectural Board of Education. There are also two private high schools. The prefecture also operates one special education school for the handicapped.
