'''Đắk Lắk''', [[Anglicisation (linguistics)|anglicized]] as '''Daklak''', is a central mountainous [[Provinces of Vietnam|province]] in the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] region, the [[Central Vietnam|Central]] of [[Vietnam]]. It borders [[Gia Lai]] to the north, [[Phú Yên]] and [[Khánh Hòa province|Khánh Hòa]] to the east, [[Lâm Đồng]] and [[Đắk Nông]] to the south, and [[Mondulkiri]] of [[Cambodia]] to the west.

Đăk Lăk is home to quite a few indigenous ethnic minorities, such as the [[Rade people|Rade]], the [[Jarai people|Jarai]] and the [[Mnong people|Mnong]], among others.

==Etymology==
The name comes from the [[Mnong language|Mnong]] (a [[Mon-Khmer languages|Mon-Khmer language]]) word ''dak Lak'' (which would sound rather like "Đác Lác" in Vietnamese), literally "[[w:vi:Hồ Lắk|Lak Lake]]",<ref name=mkm>{{Cite web|url=http://sealang.net/monkhmer/dictionary|title=Mon-Khmer Etymological Dictionary}}</ref> the largest freshwater lake in the province. The word ''dak'' means "water" or "lake", and is a [[cognate]] of the [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] ''nước/nác'' ("water").<ref name=mkm /> The official spelling in Vietnamese is ''Đắk Lắk'', despite the fact that the original Mnong word contains long "a" sounds rather than short "ă" sounds. Some other spellings such as ''Dak Lak'', ''Daklak'', ''Đăk Lăk'', ''Đắc Lắc'', and ''Darlac'' (in older French texts), among others,<ref name=spell>{{cite web|url=http://nnh.hcmussh.edu.vn/?ArticleId=d6f8484a-c367-4aa2-8bd0-7e542bb2f915|title=Cần hiểu đúng và thống nhất cách viết địa danh Đắc Lắc|publisher=Department of Linguistics, [[Ho Chi Minh City University of Social Sciences and Humanities]]|access-date=5 December 2018|archive-date=5 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181205194951/http://nnh.hcmussh.edu.vn/?ArticleId=d6f8484a-c367-4aa2-8bd0-7e542bb2f915|url-status=dead}}</ref> have also been used. The Daklak Guest House, for example, inconsistently uses ''Daklak'' and ''Đắk Lắk''.<ref>[https://www.google.com/maps/uv?hl=en&pb=!1s0x31721d86b9b748e3:0xc9e1a770cb465fc5!2m22!2m2!1i80!2i80!3m1!2i20!16m16!1b1!2m2!1m1!1e1!2m2!1m1!1e3!2m2!1m1!1e5!2m2!1m1!1e4!2m2!1m1!1e6!3m1!7e115!4shttps://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoAXEyZukOg43s0B9D45upaVGZPd53dT5aA0cR%3Dw213-h160-k-no!5snh%C3%A0+kh%C3%A1ch+t%E1%BB%89nh+daklak+-+Google+Search&imagekey=!1e10!2sAF1QipPoAXEyZukOg43s0B9D45upaVGZPd53dT5aA0cR&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi1oL3Ll4jfAhXDh3AKHT02By4QoiowCnoECAYQBg Photos of the Daklak Guest House]</ref> Linguist Nguyễn Minh Hoạt has argued that a sensible spelling would be ''Dak Lăk'', based on the ground that ''lak'' means [[dermatophytosis]] in [[Rade language|Rade]] (an unrelated language of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] family), while at the same time citing the Mnong origin as the basis for the ''dak'' part of the spelling.<ref name=spell/> The derivative [[Đắk Nông province]] appears to have been named after this province, by replacing ''Lắk'' with ''Nông'' for "Mnong".

==History==
[[File:Province de Darlac (1909).jpg|thumb|left|Map of Darlac province in 1909]]
The area now known as Đắk Lắk was originally controlled by the Kingdom of [[Champa]]. When Champa was conquered and annexed by Vietnam in the 15th century, Đắk Lắk was brought under loose Vietnamese rule. Later, in 1540, a noble named Bùi Tá Hán was appointed by the Vietnamese authorities to direct the settlement of the area by ethnic Vietnamese, bringing the highlands under more effective Vietnamese control. Military outposts were established in the area to guard against possible aggression from the west. Later, when Vietnam was [[French Indochina|occupied]] by the French, the French established a large number of [[plantation]]s in the area. Resistance to French rule was strong in Đắk Lắk, with various [[List of ethnic groups in Vietnam|minority tribes]] leading a number of significant rebellions. The most notable was a 23-year campaign led by [[N’Trang Lơng]], a [[Mnong people|M’Nông]] tribal leader. Later, Đắk Lắk was part of [[South Vietnam]], and saw considerable action in the [[Vietnam War]].

Until recently, [[Đắk Nông Province|Đắk Nông]] was a part of Đắk Lắk, but is now a separate [[Provinces of Vietnam|Province]].

== Geography ==
Đắk Lắk is based around the [[Đắk Lắk Plateau]], around six hundred metres above sea level.

About 60&nbsp;km south of [[Buôn Ma Thuột]] is [[Lak Lake]]. Overlooking the lake is the old summer residence of Emperor [[Bảo Đại]] which has been renovated into a hotel. Surrounding the lake is Jun Village, home of the Jun people. The villagers have a peculiar form of fishing where they attach metal rods to a car battery and run the rods through the water, zapping and stunning the fish, and then collecting them to keep in a tank at the village until they are needed.

==Administrative divisions==
Đắk Lắk is subdivided into 15 district-level sub-divisions:

They are further subdivided into 12 commune-level towns (or townlets), 152 communes, and 20 wards.

==Economy==
[[File:Elephant and driver Lak Lake.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Lak Lake]], in the [[Mnong people|M’Nông]] village of Buôn Jun]]
[[Coffee bean|Coffee]], fruit, and [[Natural rubber|rubber]] play an important part in its economy. Recently, there have been efforts to harness the province's considerable potential for [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] generation.
The Jun people take advantage of the small tourist trade that passes through, giving elephant rides through the village and across the lake.
