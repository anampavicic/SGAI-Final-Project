==History==
Mati comes from the Mandaya word ''Maa-ti'', which refers to the town's creek that easily dries up even after heavy rain. Pioneer settlers were the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] [[indigenous peoples]] [[Lumad|Mandaya]] and [[Kalagan people|Kalagan]], and the Arabic-Indo-Malayan-influenced [[Maguindanao people|Maguindanao]] and [[Maranao]].

=== Spanish period ===
Captain Prudencio Garcia, the pioneer political-military head in 1861, and his comrade Juan Nazareno founded the settlement of Mati and two other communities in [[Davao Oriental]].<ref name=davaoorientaltourism>{{cite web|title=History of Davao Oriental |url= https://davaooriental.gov.ph/tourism-4/history-of-davao-oriental/|accessdate=August 26, 2021}}</ref>

=== American period ===
[[File:Davao province 1918 map.JPG|thumb|upright=0.80|left|[[Davao (province)|Davao province]] in 1918 encompassing the current provinces of [[Davao Region]]]]
By October 29, 1903, Mati was declared a municipality by virtue of Act No. 21.<ref name=davaoorientaltourism/> By 1907, Act No. 189 further reaffirmed the establishment of its local government. Francisco Rojas was the first appointed mayor while the first elected mayor was Patricio Cunanan in 1923. Mati became the capital of Davao Oriental in 1967.

=== Japanese occupation and World War II ===
The [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Imperial forces]] landed in town and occupied most of eastern Davao region in 1942. Mati was liberated in 1945 by the Allied [[Philippine Commonwealth]] troops of the 6th, 10th, 101st, 102nd, 103rd, 104th, 106th, 107th and 110th Infantry Division of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]], 10th Infantry Regiment of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] and the Davaoeño guerrilla units.

===Contemporary Period===
Mati celebrated the grand centennial of its founding as a town in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|title=DECLARING 2003 AS THE CENTENNIAL YEAR OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF MATI, PROVINCE OF DAVAO ORIENTAL|date=May 9, 2003 |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2003/05/09/proclamation-no-375-s-2003/|accessdate=October 1, 2021}}</ref>

===Cityhood===

{{Hatnote|For further information, see [[League of Cities of the Philippines v. COMELEC]].}}

On June 20, 2007, the [[Commission on Elections]] officially proclaimed the ratification of Republic Act 9408 converting the Municipality of Mati into a component city.

There were 18,267 actual voters out of the 51,287 registered voters in 26 villages and 266 polling precincts during the June 18 plebiscite. Final tabulation showed Yes – 18,267 votes ({{#expr:1826700/51287 round 1}}%); No – 846 (1.6%).<ref>[http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/dav/2007/06/20/news/mati.now.a.city.html Sun.Star Davao - Mati now a city] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630214232/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/dav/2007/06/20/news/mati.now.a.city.html |date=June 30, 2007 }}</ref>

The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] declared the cityhood law of Mati and 15 other cities unconstitutional after a petition filed by the [[League of Cities of the Philippines]] in its ruling on November 18, 2008. On December 22, 2009, the cityhood law of Mati and 15 other municipalities regain its status as cities again after the court reversed its ruling on November 18, 2008. On August 23, 2010, the court reinstated its ruling on November 18, 2008, causing Mati and 15 cities to become regular municipalities. Finally, on February 15, 2011, Mati becomes a city again including the 15 municipalities declaring that the conversion to cityhood met all legal requirements.

After six years of legal battle, in its board resolution, the [[League of Cities of the Philippines]] acknowledged and recognized the cityhood of Mati and 15 other cities.

==Geography==
[[File:Sleeping Dinosaur.JPG|thumb|left|Pujada Bay and the Sleeping Dinosaur viewed from the Zigzag Road in Barangay Badas]]

Once heavily dependent on [[coconut]], the city's economy has slowly begun diversifying. The city government has established its own poultry dressing plant,<ref name="Poultry Dressing Plant">{{cite web |url=https://mb.com.ph/2020/10/09/mati-city-to-invest-in-halal-certified-chicken-dressing-plant/|title=Mati City to invest in Halal-certified chicken dressing plant|work=mb.com.ph |access-date=October 9, 2020}}</ref> and the Mati Fish Port will be operational, supporting the expansion of the fishing industry in the city.<ref name="Mati Fish Port">{{cite web |url=https://mb.com.ph/2021/06/21/construction-of-p150-m-modern-fish-port-in-mati-city-under-way/|title=Construction of P150-M modern fish port in Mati City under way|work=mb.com.ph |access-date=June 21, 2021}}</ref> Because of its tropical nature and beaches, the tourism industry in the city has been expanding rapidly in recent years.

Main goods and produce from the city include [[coconut]]s, [[pomelo]]s, [[banana]]s, [[fish]], especially [[tuna]] and [[milkfish]], [[poultry]], [[carabao]] [[dairy]], [[common sunflower|sunflowers]], and [[edible mushroom]]s.<ref name="Sunflowers">{{cite web |url= https://mindanao.politiko.com.ph/mati-city-lgu-invites-public-to-visit-sunflower-farm/ |title= Mati City LGU invites public to visit Sunflower Farm|work= mindanao.politiko.com.ph|access-date=November 5, 2023}}</ref><ref name="Carabao Dairy">{{cite web |url=https://www.themindanaojournal.com/initial-16-hybrid-carabaos-arrive-for-matis-dairy-plant/ |title=Initial 16 hybrid carabaos arrive for Mati’s dairy plant|work= themindanaojournal.com|access-date=April 23, 2021}}</ref> Mining is also a contributor to the city's economy, due to the large deposits of copper on the city's outskirts.<ref name="mtg">{{cite web |url= http://www.travelgrove.com/travel-guides/Philippines/Mati-Travel-Guide-c1496555.html |title=Mati Travel Guide, Philippines &#124; Travelgrove.com |work=travelgrove.com |access-date=March 30, 2011}}</ref>

Although the youngest city in the [[Davao Region|region]], having regained cityhood status only in 2011, Mati has gradually become an investment hub and is considered one of the emerging cities for doing business with its rapid advancements in government infrastructure and evolving business-friendly environment.

In the 2022 [[Commission on Audit (Philippines)|COA]] Report,<ref name="Financial Profile 2022 Volume 1">{{cite web |url= https://www.coa.gov.ph/reports/annual-financial-reports/afr-local-government-units/# |title=Financial Profile - Cities Calendar Year 2022 |work=coa.gov.ph |access-date=December 20, 2023}}</ref> Mati ranked fourth out of the six cities in [[Davao Region]] with a total revenue of ₱1.803 billion, only after [[Davao City]] (₱17.169 billion), [[Tagum]] (₱3.543 billion), and [[Panabo]] (₱1.818 billion), making it a key area for future growth in [[Metro Davao]].

Mati celebrates two annual grand festivals: the Pujada Bay Festival every June and the Sambuokan Festival every October. Compared to the [[Kadayawan]] of Davao and other festivals, both of Mati's are relatively new. The Pujada Bay Festival started in 2004 to promote and protect [[Pujada Bay]], while the Sambuokan Festival started in 2001 to unite Matinians during the commemoration of the municipality's founding anniversary every October 29. In years, both festivals have become alternative tourist destinations as competitors from various regions in the country start pouring in for competitions like [[street dancing|streetdancing]], [[boat racing]], and [[skimboarding]].

In 2022, the city government, together with the [[Department of Tourism (Philippines)|Department of Tourism]], launched BAY DEEP MATI, a [[freediving]] festival that is the first in the country.<ref>{{cite web|title= Mati City holds PH’s first freediving festival |url=https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1184518|website=PNA|date=September 25, 2022 |access-date= September 25, 2022}}</ref>
