'''Aragua State''' ({{langx|es|Estado Aragua}}, {{IPA|es|esˈtaðo aˈɾaɣwa|IPA}}) is one of the 23 [[States of Venezuela|states]] of [[Venezuela]]. It is located in the north-central region of Venezuela. It has plains and [[jungle (terrain)|jungles]] and [[Caribbean]] beaches. The most popular are Cata and Choroni. It has Venezuela's first national park which is called [[Henri Pittier National Park|Henri Pittier]]. The capital is [[Maracay]], other important cities include [[Turmero]] and [[El Limón, Aragua|El Limón]].

Aragua State covers a total surface area of {{cvt|7,014|km2}} and, based on the 2011 census information, the estimated population of Aragua State in 2012 is 1,630,308 inhabitants.

==Etymology==
The name of the state comes from an indigenous word of [[Cumanagoto language|Cumanagoto]] (Caribbean) origin, which is used to refer to the [[Chaguaramo]], a type of palm from the region [quotation required] However, according to Carlos Blanco Galeno, a chronicler from Turmero, it derives from the [[Cariban languages|Cariban]] aregua, and this de are ('site') and gua which in turn derives from ogun ('my thing'), so it would mean 'my place, my country'. This same word inspired the name of the [[Aragua River]], an important tributary of [[Lake Valencia (Venezuela)|Lake Valencia]].{{cn|date=December 2022}}

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2022}}
The land where the city of [[Maracay]] is located today was granted to Sebastián Díaz Alfaro in the 16th century. After his death the land passed to his son Mateo. At that time these lands were known as Valle de Tucupío and Tepatopo and were used as cattle grazing lands. Towards Tucupío, [[Tapatapa River|Tapatapa]], [[Güey River|Guey]] and El Rincón, [[Sugarcane|sugar cane]] and [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] were planted.

By the year 1700 about 40 families inhabited the valley, which went to Bishop Diego de Baños y Sotomayor to choose a parish, which was equivalent to giving consistency to the official population center.

On March 5, the city of Maracay was founded, taking its name from the Maracay River. [https://estadoaragua.org/ Maracay] suffered the vicissitudes of the emancipatory revolution, being of special interest the events of 1812-13 that took place at the La Trinidad [[hacienda]]. Later, in 1816 and 1818, there was the assault of La Cabrera and the battle of Maracay where the patriotic troops were defeated. The [[Federal War]] also left its mark on the town, seriously affecting the surrounding countryside. In addition, there was a terrible plague epidemic, apparently caused by the decomposition of fermented indigo, which claimed many victims.

The beginnings of Maracay's urban and economic transformation began during the administration of General [[Juan Vicente Gómez]], who resided in the city from the beginning of his government. In 1898, La Victoria was designated as the capital of the state and later, in 1917, it was moved to Maracay, a status it still retains.
[[File:Iglesia Nuestra Señora de La Candelaria.jpg|300px|thumb| Nuestra Señora de La Candelaria Church, established by the [[Capitania General de Venezuela|Spanish colonists]] in the 18th century in [[Turmero]], Aragua State]]

===Conquest and Spanish Colonial Era===
Aragua was part of the [[Province of Caracas]] from 1555.

European groups later penetrated the area of Aragua than what is now [[Carabobo]] or [[Miranda (state)|Miranda]]. It was in the last decade of the 16th century when the Spanish began to implant encomiendas in the Valleys of Aragua. By 1620 all the lands of Aragua were divided among some 40 [[Encomienda|encomenderos]], who lived primarily in the Valley of Caracas.

Maracay was founded in 1701.

By 1780 La Victoria was a town with about 800 Indians who only spoke Spanish and more than 4 thousand people from other groups, including Spaniards, [[Creole peoples|Creoles]], [[mestizo]]s, [[Black people|blacks]] and [[Zambo]]s.

[[Alexander von Humboldt]] referred to the fact that the population by 1800 in the area of the valleys of Aragua - which at that time included both sides of Lake Valencia - was mostly composed of brown and creole people, apart from zambos and [[Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|slaves]] and that there were still approximately 5000 registered Indians, most of whom were concentrated in [[Turmero]] and Guacara. None of them spoke their ancestral languages anymore.

===19th century===
Aragua was created as a province on February 11, 1848 when it was separated from that of Caracas, with a territory similar to that which today encompasses the current state of Aragua and composed of La Victoria, Turmero, Maracay, Villa de Cura and San Sebastian, having the city of La Victoria as its capital.

In 1864 Aragua became an independent state until 1866, when it merged with Guárico to form the state of Guzmán Blanco. Its capital changed to [[Villa de Cura]] in 1881. Finally in 1899 Aragua recovered its status as an autonomous state
[[File:Iglesia San Martin de Tours II.jpg|thumb|Church of San Martin de Tours, [[Colonia Tovar]], was established by German immigrants in 1843]]

===20th century===
In 1917 its capital was moved from La Victoria to Maracay. The dictator [[Juan Vicente Gómez]] stayed most of his time in Maracay and it was there that he died in 1935.

Its definitive limits were established by protocols signed with the bordering states at different times: in 1909 (Miranda), 1917 (Carabobo) and 1933 (Guárico).

In 1989 he elected his [[List of governors of Aragua|first governor]] under direct universal and secret elections which ended the practice of having a government designated from the [[Cabinet of Venezuela|central government]] in Caracas.

==Geography==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2022}}
[[File:Cuyagua 001.jpg|thumb|[[Cuyagua]], Aragua state.]]
Aragua borders the [[Caribbean Sea]] to the north, with its coastline backed by the fast-rising central [[Venezuelan Coastal Range|Cordillera mountain range]]. [[Codazzi Peak]] reaches over 2400&nbsp;m above sea level. Much of the rest of the state is made up of fertile valleys used for intensive agriculture, apart from in the extreme south where the flats of the central [[Llanos]] region begin. On the western border is [[Lake Valencia (Venezuela)|Lake Valencia]].

The main rivers in the state are the [[Aragua River|Aragua]], the [[Guárico River|Guárico]], the [[El Limón River|El Limón]], the [[Tuy River|Tuy]], the Pao and the [[Turmero River|Turmero]]. They flow into the Caribbean Sea, Lake Valencia, or feed the vast [[Orinoco River]] network. The Camatagua reservoir is one of the main reservoirs supplying Caracas.

===Geology===

Four natural regions can be distinguished in the entity: the coastal mountain range, the depression of Lake Valencia, the inland mountain range, and the Central Wavy Plains. In the depression of Lake Valencia, recent sedimentary formations predominate, while the mountainous areas present others that are highly affected by metamorphic processes, although in the presence of nuclei with more conserved igneous and sedimentary rocks. In the mountain ranges of the Interior chain, galleys can be observed, as spurs of that mountain range, which smoothen their forms towards the South until they enter the formation of the plains.

===Area===

The region has an area of 7,014&nbsp;km², most of which is mountainous, and represents 0.76% of the Venezuelan territory. The maritime coast of the state extends from Turiamo Bay in the west to Puerto Maya in the east, corresponding to the central section of the Coastal Range. The southern zone of the state runs from the southern piedmont lands of the Caribbean mountain range, through the curve of the 100 meter level that separates the Llanos Altos from the Llanos Bajos to the depression of the Unare River and the San Carlos River that separates it from the Llanos Altos Occidentales.

===Relief===

One of the largest reliefs in the world crosses the state of [https://estadoaragua.org/ Aragua], in an east-west direction, two parallel mountain ranges, separated from each other by a central depression, which determines the existence of three well-differentiated physiographic regions, which follow each other from north to south. The northern end is hilly with the central stretch of the Litoral mountain range that culminates with El Cenizo peak at 2,436 meters above sea level and Codazzi peak at 2,426 meters above sea level.

===Hydrography===

The hydrographic network of the state is part of three major points: the tip of the Caribbean Sea, formed by the rivers; San Miguel, [[Ocumare River|Ocumare]], Cata, [[Gaurapito River|Gaurapito]], [[Aroa River (Venezuela)|Aroa]] and through the river Tuy, the rivers of its upper basin: the [[Orinoco River Basin|Orinoco river basin]], formed by the high point and part of the middle point of the [[Guárico River|Guárico river]] and the middle part of the [[Memo River|Memo river]] and finally, the endorheic point of the Valencia lake where the [[Aragua River|Aragua]], [[Turmero River|Turmero]], [[Maracay River|Maracay]], [[Caño Grande River|Caño Grande]], [[Tapatapa River|Tapatapa]], [[Tocorón River|Tocorón]] and Las Minas rivers pour their waters. In the latter, the surface courses have been considerably reduced, as it is no longer possible to use the water from these rivers for human consumption. These rivers have now become the main collectors of wastewater discharges, both for urban industrial and agricultural use.

===Climate===
[[File:Cata, Aragua 1.JPG|thumb|Cata Bay, Aragua]]
Due to its diversity in relief and altitudes that it possesses in all its extension, there are different thermal floors in which the temperature tends to have different climatic characteristics and temperatures that decrease with the increase of the altitude, in the coastal strip dominates a semi-arid and warm climate, as it is evidenced in Turiamo and Puerto Maya, Although orographic rainfall occurs at elevations on the northern flank of the Serranía de Litoral, allowing for cooler and more humid conditions, which make possible the formation of cloud forests in the Henri Pittier National Park, local conditions allow for greater humidity and warmer temperatures in some coastal coves, such as Chuao, Choroní and Ocumare, which are used in traditional cocoa plantations.

At the altitudes of the Coastal Range, an isothermal climate is expressed, reaching in [[Colonia Tovar]], at 1,900 meters above sea level, an average annual temperature of only 15.4&nbsp;°C and rainfall of 1,000&nbsp;mm per year. In the depression of Lake Valencia and the valleys of Aragua, warmer conditions are recognized. In Maracay, at 545 meters above sea level, an average annual temperature of 25&nbsp;°C and annual rainfall of 834&nbsp;mm are recorded, with a well-defined dry season. In the plain sector, there is a rainy tropical savanna climate, with an average rainfall of 1,100&nbsp;mm, a rigorous dry season and average annual temperatures of 26&nbsp;°C.

===Soils===
[[File:Llamado de olas..jpg|thumb|Chuao, Aragua State]]
The lands of the valleys of Aragua are rich in minerals, as well as fertile; even the mountainous areas are suitable for certain types of crops. There you can find soils with a medium accumulation of organic matter and clay. The banks of the lake show a formation of calcium content due to the presence of fossils. Due to these characteristics, the soil of the state of Aragua is one of the most fertile in the country.

===Vegetation===
Vegetation ranges from abundant foliage trees, present in the cloud forests of the [[Henri Pittier National Park]], on the Litoral mountain range, to thorny scrub in the coastal area. In the areas of valleys and [[savanna]]hs, grasses predominate, accompanied by trees such as kapok, cedar and saman.

==Politics and government==

As a federal state, it is autonomous and equal in political terms to the other members of the [[Politics of Venezuela|Federation]], it organizes its administration and public powers through the [[Constitution of Aragua]] State, which was adopted in 2002. The same establishes the division of powers into executive and legislative. This Constitution can only be reformed totally or partially by the legislative power of Aragua, and to be approved, they need the absolute majority of the state deputies.
[[File:Cuartel Mariano Montilla.jpg|thumb|Mariano Montilla Barracks, La Victoria, Aragua State]]

===Executive branch===
It is composed of the governor of Aragua and a group of state secretaries who are appointed by him. The governor is elected by the people by direct and secret vote for a period of four years and with the possibility of immediate re-election for an equal period, being in charge of the state administration.

Since direct elections for [[List of Governors of States of Venezuela|Venezuela state governors]] in 1989, Aragua has been governed by the [[Movement for Socialism (Venezuela)|Movement for Socialism]] and [[For Social Democracy|PODEMOS]] (1989 - 2008). The current governor is [[Daniela González]] of the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela|PSUV]].<ref>[https://sumarium.info/2021/08/31/juramentan-a-daniela-gonzalez-como-gobernadora-encargada-de-aragua/ Juramentan a Daniela González como gobernadora encargada de Aragua]</ref>

Aragua State, with 8.28% of the country's total population, is the sixth most populated state in Venezuela. The total population of the state was 2,093,224 inhabitants in 2015.
The population is located on the coast and in the lower valleys. The valleys of Aragua are one of the most populated regions of Venezuela, due to the rapid process of industrialization of the city of Maracay and its important metropolitan area of more than 2.1 million inhabitants, of which a little more than 230,000 inhabitants, are part of its area of influence spread between the states of Carabobo and Guárico.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

=== Race and ethnicity ===

According to the 2011 Census, the racial composition of the population was:<ref name=Census2011>{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.gob.ve/documentos/Demografia/CensodePoblacionyVivienda/pdf/nacional.pdf|title=Resultado Básico del XIV Censo Nacional de Población y Vivienda 2011 (Mayo 2014)|page=29|publisher=Ine.gov.ve|access-date=8 September 2015}}</ref>

The population in the region is very diverse, due to the influence of immigration that existed from the 1950s until the present day. Most of its population is a product of the mixing between Spaniards and local natives or Spaniards and Africans. In the northern part of the state, where the highest population density and the largest urban area in the state are found, the majority of whites are present, especially in the municipalities: [[Tovar Municipality, Aragua|Tovar]], [[Mario Briceño Iragorry Municipality|Mario Briceño Iragorry]] and [[Girardot Municipality, Aragua|Girardot]].

The Municipality of Tovar, in the north of the state, is populated almost entirely by [[German Venezuelans|white people of German descent]], since this was the site of the Tovar Colony, a town founded by [[German Venezuelans|Germans]] who immigrated to Venezuela in the nineteenth century.
