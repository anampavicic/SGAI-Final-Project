Lagos emerged as a home to the [[Awori tribe|Awori]] subgroup of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] of [[West Africa]] islands in the 15th century, which are contained in the present-day Local Government Areas ([[List of Lagos State local government areas by population|LGAs]]) of [[Lagos Island]], [[Eti-Osa]], [[Amuwo-Odofin]] and [[Apapa]]. Before 15th century, the Awori settled on a Farmstead along the coastal line in which they worked and lived in and around their Farmstead which translates to Ereko in Yoruba, which formed the Lagos indigenous name “Eko”. The lands are separated by creeks, fringing the southwest mouth of [[Lagos Lagoon]], while being protected from the Atlantic Ocean by [[barrier island]]s and long sand spits such as [[Bar Beach, Lagos|Bar Beach]], which stretch up to {{cvt|100|km}} east and west of the mouth. Due to rapid urbanisation, the city expanded to the west of the lagoon to include areas in the present day [[Lagos Mainland]], [[Ajeromi-Ifelodun]], and [[Surulere]].

The [[University of Lagos]] is one of the [[Education in Nigeria#First generation universities|first generation universities]] of Nigeria. The business district of Lagos is home to [[Tinubu Square]], named after the aristocratic slave trader [[Efunroye Tinubu]]. Lagos contains [[Murtala Muhammed International Airport]], named after [[Murtala Muhammad]], one of the former Nigerian presidents; the airport is one of the busiest African airports. [[National Stadium, Lagos|Lagos National Stadium]] has hosted various international sports events such as the [[1980 African Cup of Nations]].

== Etymology ==
''Lagos'' is derived from the Portuguese word for "lakes". The pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|eɪ|ɡ|ɒ|s}} ({{respell|LAY|goss}}) is typically standard in [[British English|British]] and [[Nigerian English]].<ref name="wells"/><ref name = "hd">{{Cite web|url=https://howdoyousaythatword.com/word/lagos/|title=Listen To An EXPERT Would Say Lagos? Find Out TODAY. Lagos Pronunciation}}</ref> Speakers of [[American English]] often use the pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɑː|g|oʊ|s}} ({{respell|LAH|gohss}}), which sounds more similar to the original Portuguese pronunciation.<ref name="wells"/><ref name="hd"/> The native [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] name ''Èkó'' is also used by [[Yoruba people]]. Lagos may have been named after the Portuguese town called Lagos, since, at the time of the 15th century, [[Lagos, Portugal]], was the main centre of Portuguese maritime expeditions down the African coast.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/places-global-african-history/lagos-nigeria-c-1350/ | title=Lagos, Nigeria (Ca. 1350- ) | date=6 July 2010 }}</ref>

== Administration ==
Lagos was formerly the capital city of [[Nigeria]], but it has since been replaced by [[Abuja]]. Abuja officially became the capital of [[Nigeria]] on December 12 1991, although the decision to move the federal capital had been made in Act No.6 of 1976. Lagos is also home to the High Court of the [[Lagos State Judiciary]], housed in an old colonial building on Lagos Island.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nigeria-law.org/LagosStateJudiciaryInBrief.htm|title=Lagos State Judiciary|publisher=Nigeria Law Online|access-date=4 April 2012|archive-date=8 September 2012|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120908193417/http://www.nigeria-law.org/LagosStateJudiciaryInBrief.htm}}</ref>

[[File:Map of the Local Government Areas of Lagos.png|thumb|upright=2.5|A map showing the 16 [[Local Government Areas in Nigeria|LGAs]] making up Lagos Metropolitan Area]]
In terms of administration, Lagos is not a single [[municipality]] and therefore has no overall city administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhabitat.org/downloads/docs/9175_77451_Cities_and_CitizensSeries_Addis_casablanca_Lagos.pdf |title=Cities & Citizens Series:''Urban Iniquities in three Cities'' |publisher=Unhabit Online |access-date=4 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013154517/http://www.unhabitat.org/downloads/docs/9175_77451_Cities_and_CitizensSeries_Addis_casablanca_Lagos.pdf |archive-date=13 October 2013 }}</ref> The geographical city limits of Metropolitan Lagos comprise 16 of the 20 Local Government Areas of Lagos State. The latter entity provides overall government for the metropolitan region. The former Municipality of Lagos, which covered Lagos Island, Ikoyi, and Victoria Island as well as some mainland territory, was managed by the Lagos City Council (LCC), but it was disbanded in 1976 and divided into several [[Local Government Areas in Nigeria|Local Government Areas]] (most notably Lagos Island LGA, [[Lagos Mainland|Lagos Mainland LGA]] and [[Eti-Osa|Eti-Osa LGA]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=Public Admin.

The mainland beyond the Municipality of Lagos, on the other hand, included several separate towns and settlements such as [[Mushin, Nigeria|Mushin]], Ikeja and Agege. In the wake of the 1970s Nigerian oil boom, Lagos experienced a population explosion, untamed economic growth, and unmitigated rural migration. This caused the outlying towns and settlements to develop rapidly, thus forming the present-day "Lagos Metropolitan Area", also known as "Metropolitan Lagos". The history of Lagos is still evidenced in the layout of the LGAs that display the unique identities of the cultures that created them.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}<ref>{{Cite web |last=Trek London |date=20 March 2023 |title=History of Lagos: The Cultural Background of Lagos LGAs |url=https://treklondon.co.uk/history-of-lagos/ |access-date=30 May 2023 |website=TrekLondon UK |language=en-GB}}</ref>

By 2006, the metro area around Lagos had extended beyond Lagos State's boundaries and attained a [[megacity]] status. This much larger area is referred to as "Greater Metropolitan Lagos" or "Lagos Megacity Region", which is a continuously built-up land area of an additional {{convert|1535.4|km2|sqmi|lk=out|abbr=off}}, in LGAs situated next to Lagos's eastern and western city limits in Lagos State, and also beyond its northern limits, spilling into some LGAs in adjoining [[Ogun State]]. Ogun State LGAs that have become part of Greater Metropolitan Lagos include [[Obafemi Owode]], [[Sagamu]], [[Ifo, Ogun State|Ifo]], [[Ado-Odo/Ota]] and part of [[Ewekoro]].<ref name="The sustainable city"/>

Today, the word ''Lagos'' most often refers to the urban area, called "Metropolitan Lagos" in Nigeria, which includes both the islands of the former municipality of Lagos and the mainland suburbs. Lagos State government is responsible for some of the utilities including roads and transportation, power, water, health, and education. Metropolitan Lagos extends over 16 of the 20 LGAs of [[Lagos State]] and contains about 85% of the population of Lagos State, including some semi-rural areas.<ref name="METRO">{{cite web |url= http://www.africaleadership.org/rc/Managing%20Metropolitan%20Lagos.pdf |title= Managing Metropolitan Lagos |publisher= R.Rasaki |access-date= 4 April 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120513124623/http://www.africaleadership.org/rc/Managing%20Metropolitan%20Lagos.pdf |archive-date= 13 May 2012 }}</ref> Lagos has a considerable number of high-rise buildings that dominate its skyline.

Although the 2006 National Population Census of [[Nigeria]] credited the metropolitan area with a population figure of 7,937,932, the figure is at variance with some projections by the United Nations and other population agencies and groups worldwide. The population figure of [[Lagos State]] given by the Lagos State Government is 17,553,924. That figure was based on claimed conducted enumeration for social planning by the Lagos State Government's "parallel census" and it believes that since the inhabitants of the metropolitan area of Lagos constitute 88% of the Lagos State population, the population of metropolitan Lagos is about 15.5 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nigerianmuse.com/20070207234037zg/important_documents/Lagos_Census_Affairs|title=Document|publisher=Nigerian Muse Online|date=7 February 2007|access-date=4 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208100555/http://www.nigerianmuse.com/20070207234037zg/important_documents/Lagos_Census_Affairs|archive-date=8 February 2010}}</ref>

It is by most estimates, one of the fastest-growing cities in the world.<ref name = africareport/> Lagos is experiencing a population increase of about 275,000 persons per annum due to the influx of people from other regions for economic purposes.

{{Main|Architecture of Lagos}}

The city of Lagos has the tallest skyline in Nigeria. The architectural styles in Lagos are diverse and range from tropical and vernacular to colonial European and ultramodern buildings or a mixture. Brazilian style architecture brought by the creoles is evident in buildings such as Water House and Shitta Bey Mosque.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KbT5AQAAQBAJ&q=Lagos+european+brazilian+colonial+architecture&pg=PA118|page=118|title=The Human Factor in Changing Africa|first=Melville J.|last=Herskovits|publisher=Routledge, 2013|isbn=978-1-136-5296-10|date=5 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/1987/09/06/brazilian-houses-in-nigeria-are-a-legacy-of-thousands-of-freed/|title=Brazilian Houses In Nigeria Are A Legacy Of Thousands Of Freed Slaves|location=New York|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|first=James|last=Brook|date=6 September 1987|access-date=30 May 2017|archive-date=16 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816232816/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-09-06/news/8703080006_1_brazilian-nigeria-calabar|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://life.guardian.ng/2016/10/five-architectural-wonders-of-lagos/|title=Five Architectural Wonders of Lagos|website=The Guardian|access-date=30 May 2017|archive-date=21 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170521055336/http://life.guardian.ng/2016/10/five-architectural-wonders-of-lagos/|url-status=live}}</ref> Skyscrapers and most high rise buildings are centered on the islands, while the mainland has some high rise buildings.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://guardian.ng/art/open-house-lagos-opens-a-new-vista-in-lagos-architecture/|first=Tonye|last=Bakare|date=15 May 2016|access-date=27 August 2017|title=Open House Lagos opens a new vista in Lagos architecture|newspaper=The Guardian|archive-date=27 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827090649/https://guardian.ng/art/open-house-lagos-opens-a-new-vista-in-lagos-architecture/|url-status=live}}</ref> In recent years, the Lagos State government has renovated existing parks and green areas, with a long-term goal of expansion.

==== Island ====
The Island is a loose geographical term that is used to define the area of Lagos that is separated from the "Mainland" by the main channel draining the lagoon into the Atlantic Ocean, which forms Lagos Harbour. The Island is mainly a collection of islands that are separated from each other by creeks and are connected by bridges. The smaller sections of some creeks have been dredged and built over. This part of Lagos is the area where most business activities and entertainment events take place, as well as where most of the upscale residential areas are concentrated. The Local Government Areas (LGAs) that are considered to be on the Island include [[Lagos Island]] and [[Eti-Osa]]. The major upscale Island neighbourhoods within these LGAs include [[Ikoyi]] and [[Victoria Island (Nigeria)|Victoria Island]]. Three major bridges join the Island to the Mainland. They are the [[Carter Bridge]], which starts from Iddo; the [[Eko Bridge]] (formerly called the Second Mainland Bridge); and the [[Third Mainland Bridge]], which passes through densely populated mainland suburbs to the Lagos Lagoon. The Ikoyi link bridge links Ikoyi and Lekki Phase 1, both of which are part of the Island.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge in Lagos, Nigeria|url=https://www.julius-berger-int.com/en/references/lekki-ikoyi-link-bridge-in-lagos-Nigeria|access-date=27 January 2022|website=Julius Berger International|language=en|archive-date=11 September 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220911175256/https://www.julius-berger-int.com/en/references/lekki-ikoyi-link-bridge-in-lagos-Nigeria|url-status=live}}</ref>

In Ikoyi there are military and police barracks, a top-security prison, and a federal high court of Nigeria. Ikoyi also has [[Hotel|hotels]], [[Nightclub|nightclubs]], a recreational park, and one of Africa's largest golf courses. Originally a [[middle class]] neighbourhood, in recent years it has become a fashionable residential enclave for the [[upper middle class]] to the [[upper class]].

Along with Ikoyi, Victoria Island occupies a major area in Lagos that boasts several shopping districts. On its seashore along the Atlantic front there is an environmentally reconstructed [[Bar Beach, Lagos|Bar Beach]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Best Lagos |date=16 September 2023 |title= Best Beaches in Victoria Island |url=https://bestlagos.ng/best-beaches-victoria-island-lagos/ |access-date=20 September 2023 |website=BestLagos.ng |language=en-GB}}</ref>

'''Ajah/Lekki'''

The Lekki Peninsula shares some prestige with its Ikoyi and Victoria Island neighbours. Development has stretched the piece of land further such that the Ibeju axis, though closer to Epe (which is on the outskirts of Lagos) is almost always described as part of Lekki.  The expanse of land starts from the Lekki toll gate, which was the focal stage of the famous #EndSars protest in October 2020, and ends in Ibeju-Lekki and boasts of communities slowly inching their way to suburb status such as [[Ajah, Lagos|Ajah]], Awoyaya, Sangotedo, Abijo, and Eputu. There is quite a bit of place to see – the [[Lekki Conservation Centre]]; The Novare Mall; The [[Lekki Free Trade Zone]] – Dangote, Africa's richest man is building his refinery in this FTZ; [[Lagos Business School]]; [[Eleko Beach]]; [[Elegushi Beach]]; La Camaigne Tropicana – a beach/tourist getaway, [[Pan-Atlantic University]].

===== Iddo =====
Across the main channel of the lagoon from Lagos Island, there is a smaller settlement called [[Iddo Island|Iddo]]. Iddo is also [[Lagos Terminus railway station|a railroad terminus]] and it is now situated in the Lagos Mainland Local Government Area after it was connected to the Mainland like a peninsula.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://laurapodolnick.com/lagosny.pdf |title=Giant Cities of Tiny Islands |access-date=4 April 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66gvsx099?url=http://laurapodolnick.com/lagosny.pdf |archive-date=5 April 2012 }}</ref>

==== Mainland ====
A huge population of Lagosians also live on the Lagos Mainland, and most industries are located there. The Mainland is known for its music and nightlife, which used to be located in areas around [[Yaba, Lagos|Yaba]], Ikeja, and [[Surulere]]. However, in recent years more nightclubs have sprung up on the Island, making the Island (particularly Victoria Island, Ikate, and Lekki Phase 1) the main nightlife attraction. Mainland LGAs include [[Surulere]], [[Apapa]], and [[Lagos Mainland]]. Metropolitan Lagos suburban LGAs include: [[Agege]], [[Amuwo Odofin]], [[Mushin, Lagos|Mushin]], [[Oshodi-Isolo]] and Ikeja (site of [[Murtala Muhammed International Airport]] and the capital of Lagos State).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Best Lagos |date=16 September 2023 |title=Best Clubs in Lagos |url=https://bestlagos.ng/best-clubs-lagos/ |access-date=19 September 2023 |website=BestLagos.ng |language=en-GB}}</ref>

Major areas on the Mainland include [[Ebute Metta]], [[Yaba, Lagos|Yaba]] and [[Ejigbo, Lagos|Ejigbo]]. Some rivers, like [[Badagry]] Creek, flow parallel to the coast for some distance before exiting through the sand bars to the sea.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}<ref>{{Cite web |last=Trek London UK |date=16 June 2023 |title=The Badagry River |url=https://treklondon.co.uk/the-badagry-river/ |access-date=15 September 2023 |website=Trek London.UK |language=en-GB}}</ref>

== Climate ==
Lagos experiences a [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'') according to the [[Köppen climate classification]], as there are three months under {{convert|60|mm|in|1|disp=or|abbr=on}} of rain, and annual rainfall is not nearly high enough for [[tropical monsoon climate|tropical monsoon]] classification. The wet season starts in March and ends in October, while the dry season starts in November and ends in February. The wettest month is June with precipitation total {{convert|316|mm|in|2|disp=or|abbr=on}}, while the driest month is January with precipitation total {{convert|13|mm|in|2|disp=or|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

Located near the equator, Lagos has only a slight seasonal temperature variation, with mean high temperatures ranging from {{cvt|28|to|32|C|F}}. Lagos has the highest temperatures in March with a daily range from {{cvt|32|to|26|C|F}}, and least hot temperatures in August ranging from {{cvt|28|to|24|C|F}}, not unlike the seasons of coastal locations in the Southern Hemisphere.

=== Climate change ===
A 2019 paper published in [[PLOS One]] estimated that under [[Representative Concentration Pathway#4.5|Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5]], a "moderate" scenario of [[climate change]] where global warming reaches ~{{convert|2.5-3|C-change|F-change}} by 2100, the climate of Lagos in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of [[Panama City]]. The annual temperature would increase by {{convert|1.6|C-change|F-change}} and the temperature of the warmest month by {{convert|1.5|C-change|F-change}}, while the temperature of the coldest month would be {{convert|2.9|C-change|F-change}} higher.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bastin |first1=Jean-Francois |last2=Clark |first2=Emily |last3=Elliott |first3=Thomas |last4=Hart |first4=Simon |last5=van den Hoogen |first5=Johan |last6=Hordijk |first6=Iris |last7=Ma |first7=Haozhi |last8=Majumder |first8=Sabiha |last9=Manoli |first9=Gabriele |last10=Maschler |first10=Julia |last11=Mo |first11=Lidong |last12=Routh |first12=Devin |last13=Yu |first13=Kailiang |last14=Zohner |first14=Constantin M. |last15=Thomas W. |first15=Crowther |title=Understanding climate change from a global analysis of city analogues |journal=PLOS ONE |date=10 July 2019 |volume=14 |issue=7 |at=S2 Table.

Moreover, according to the 2022 [[IPCC Sixth Assessment Report]], Lagos is one of 12 major African cities ([[Abidjan]], [[Alexandria]], [[Algiers]], [[Cape Town]], [[Casablanca]], [[Dakar]], [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Durban]], Lagos, [[Lomé]], [[Luanda]] and [[Maputo]]) that would be the most severely affected by [[sea level rise]]. It estimates that they would collectively sustain cumulative damage of US$65 billion under RCP 4.5 and US$86.5 billion in the high-emission scenario RCP 8.5 by the year 2050. Additionally, RCP 8.5 combined with the hypothetical impact from [[marine ice sheet instability]] at high levels of warming would involve up to US$137.5 billion in damage, while the additional accounting for the "low-probability, high-damage events" may increase aggregate risks to US$187 billion for the "moderate" RCP4.5, US$206 billion for RCP8.5 and US$397 billion under the high-end ice sheet instability scenario.<ref>Trisos, C.H., I.O.

== Economy ==
The city of Lagos is a major economic focal point in Nigeria, generating around 30-35% of the country's GDP. Most commercial and financial businesses are carried out in the [[Central business districts|central business district]] situated on the island. This is also where most of the country's commercial banks, financial institutions, and major corporations are headquartered. Lagos is also the major information communications and telecommunications (ICT) hub of West Africa.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d-Gj-fyEHqMC&pg=PA66|page=66|title=Knowledge, Technology, and Cluster-based Growth in Africa (WBI development studies)|author=Douglas Zhihua Zeng|publisher=World Bank Publications|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8213-7307-1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=ICT Development: Nigeria Seeks Increased Regional Collaboration among West African States |url=https://www.ncc.gov.ng/media-centre/news-headlines/965-ict-development-nigeria-seeks-increased-regional-collaboration-among-west-african-states |access-date=12 March 2022 |website=ncc.gov.ng |archive-date=7 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220707012518/https://www.ncc.gov.ng/media-centre/news-headlines/965-ict-development-nigeria-seeks-increased-regional-collaboration-among-west-african-states |url-status=live }}</ref> Lagos is developing a [[24/7 service|24-hour economy]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/2015/08/27/ambode-security-and-lagos-quest-for-247-economy/|title=Ambode, Security And Lagos Quest For 24/7 Economy|date=27 August 2015|access-date=1 October 2016|publisher=PM News|archive-date=27 January 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220127011554/https://pmnewsnigeria.com/2015/08/27/ambode-security-and-lagos-quest-for-247-economy/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="nightlife">{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TRAVEL/04/20/lagos.visit/index.html?iref=24hours|title=24 hours in Lagos: The city that never sleeps|first=Stephanie|last=Busari|date=1 April 2009|publisher=CNN|access-date=1 October 2016|archive-date=9 April 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220409140437/http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TRAVEL/04/20/lagos.visit/index.html?iref=24hours|url-status=live}}</ref>

The globalisation of Lagos' economy is rated "beta minus" by the GaWC.<ref>[[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]]</ref> This is equivalent to [[Manchester]] or [[Edinburgh]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].

=== Financial institutions ===
[[File:An array of iconic buildings in Lagos Nigeria starting with United Bank of Africa.jpg|thumb|Financial district of Lagos]]
Lagos is a major financial and banking centre. The four largest banks in West and Central Africa are headquartered in Lagos,<ref name=":5">{{Cite web |last=Ford |first=Neil |date=28 September 2022 |title=West Africa's Top Banks in 2022 |url=https://african.business/2022/09/finance-services/west-africas-top-banks |access-date=18 August 2023 |website=African Business |language=en-GB}}</ref> and another nine banks in Lagos are among the 20 largest banks in the region. [[Zenith Bank]], [[Access Bank plc|Access Bank]], [[Guaranty Trust Holding Company PLC|Guaranty Trust Bank]] and [[First Bank of Nigeria|First Bank]] have capital of more than US$2 billion each.<ref name=":5" /> Banking headquarters are located on Victoria Island and Lagos Island.

The insurance industry in Nigeria is comparatively and modestly developed, with an industry turnover of around US$1 billion per year.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Insurance companies in Nigeria: ranking 2022 |url=https://www.atlas-mag.net/en/article/top-5-nigerian-insurers-according-to-turnover-in-2019 |access-date=18 August 2023 |website=atlas-mag.net |language=en}}</ref> As with the banks, the headquarters of the insurance companies are predominantly located in Lagos.

=== Ports ===
{{Main|Apapa Port Complex|Tin Can Island Port|Lekki Port}}
The Port of Lagos, formally known as the Lagos-Elbert Mathews Memorial Port, is Nigeria's leading [[port]] and one of the largest and busiest Ports in Africa. Due to the large urban population, Lagos is categorized as a medium-port megacity using the Southampton System for port-city classification.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/03088839.2020.1802785|title=The Southampton system: A new universal standard approach for port-city classification|year=2021|last1=Roberts|first1=Toby|last2=Williams|first2=Ian|last3=Preston|first3=John|journal=Maritime Policy & Management|volume=48|issue=4|pages=530–542|s2cid=225502755|doi-access=free}}</ref> It is administered by the [[Nigerian Ports Authority]]. [[File:Free-Trade-Zone-Lekki-English2.jpg|thumb|Lagos, its ports, airports, free trade zone and light rail system]]The ''Port of Lagos / Apapa'' is the oldest and largest port in the country, both in terms of land area and cargo volume handled. More than half of Nigeria's maritime trade is handled here, and the port also acts as a transhipment point for landlocked countries such as Chad and Niger. Around 1,000 ships with 5,700,000 tonnes of cargo call at the Lagos port complex annually.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web |last=Bhattacharjee |first=Shilavadra |date=30 May 2022 |title=6 Major Ports in Nigeria |url=https://www.marineinsight.com/know-more/ports-in-nigeria/ |access-date=2 July 2023 |website=Marine Insight |language=en-US}}</ref>

''Tin Can Island Port'' is located west of Apapa near the Lagos Port Complex. It was established in 1975.

In early 2023, the [[Lekki Port|''deep sea port of Lekki'']] was commissioned 50&nbsp;km east of Lagos. This thus does not belong to the urban area of Lagos but to the [[Lagos State|state of the same name]].

=== Entertainment industry and media ===

==== Nollywood ====
{{Main|Cinema of Nigeria}}
[[File:Clapper Lady.jpg|thumb|Filming set in Lagos]]
Lagos is the centre of the West African film, music, and TV industries. The film industry in the Surulere locality ranks second or third in the world, ahead of or behind Hollywood, depending on the survey.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/10/nigeria-africa-biggest-economy-nollywood | title=Hello Nollywood: how Nigeria became Africa's biggest economy overnight | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date=10 April 2014 | access-date=12 April 2014 | author=Liston, Enjoli | archive-date=12 April 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412020045/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/10/nigeria-africa-biggest-economy-nollywood | url-status=live }}</ref> PricewaterhouseCoopers Int. forecasts that the Nigerian entertainment industry will grow 85% to $15 billion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theafricareport.com/126644/nigeria-media-players-are-creative-and-cash-rich/|title=Nigeria: Media and Entertainment to hit $15bn by 2025|website=Theafricareport.com|date=October 2021|access-date=27 December 2021|archive-date=27 May 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220527133119/https://www.theafricareport.com/126644/nigeria-media-players-are-creative-and-cash-rich/|url-status=live}}</ref>
Since the success of the Nigerian thriller "The Figurine", Nigerian film has increasingly turned to high-quality productions that are also commercially successful. This, in turn, has led to consistently new box office revenue records in Nigeria (2009's "The Figurine," 2013's "Half of a Yellow Sun," 2016's "The Wedding Party", 2023's "Battle on Buka Street").<ref>{{cite web | url=http://thenationonlineng.net/new/toronto-nigerians-disagree-over-new-nollywood/ | title=Toronto: Nigerians disagree over new Nollywood | work=The Nation Newspaper | date=14 September 2014 | access-date=24 March 2015 | author=Akande, Victor | archive-date=22 September 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922123311/http://thenationonlineng.net/new/toronto-nigerians-disagree-over-new-nollywood/ | url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Newspapers ====
In Nigeria, newspapers are available in digital format and are predominantly produced in Lagos. The most widely read newspaper in Lagos, by its own account, is [[The Punch|Punch]]. The [[Vanguard (Nigeria)|Vanguard]] newspaper is one of the few dailies that is not only available online but also in print. Other publications include [[The Guardian (Nigeria)|The Guardian]], [[The Nation (Nigeria)|The Nation]], [[The Sun (Nigeria)|The Sun]] and the [[Nigerian Tribune]]. The latter was founded in colonial times, in 1949.

==== Television ====
The most watched television station in Lagos (and in Nigeria) is the 24-hour news channel [[Channels TV]], based in Lagos. Some of its presenters use an overly correct standard of British English that compatriots like to mock. The same can be said of [[Arise News|Arise TV]] and the state broadcaster [[Nigerian Television Authority|NTA]]. The private [[Africa Independent Television|African Independent Television]] focuses on entertainment and infotainment. Programmes in [[pidgin English]] or in [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] have moved to digital streaming services and offer [[action film]]s, [[Comedy|comedies]] and [[Romance film|heartbreak productions]].

=== Oil refinery ===
{{Main|Dangote Refinery}}

For decades, there was no oil processing industry in Nigeria, apart from illegal refineries in the Niger Delta (which are very polluting due to the lack of [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]]). Nigeria therefore had to have the end products of domestic crude oil such as [[fuel]]s, [[bitumen]], [[Paraffin (fuel)|paraffin]], [[motor oil]], [[polypropylene]] etc. produced in US or European refineries, with transport costs over thousands of nautical miles and margins for middlemen.

=== Parks and gardens ===
[[File:Images of Freedom Park 28.jpg|thumb|Freedom Park]]
''[[Freedom Park (Lagos)|Freedom Park]]'' is a memorial and recreational park in the middle of Lagos city centre on Lagos Island, Nigeria, which used to be Her Majesty's Broad Street Prison.

It was erected to mark the 50th Independence Anniversary celebrations in October 2010. The park is a national memorial, a historical landmark, a cultural site and an arts and recreation centre. Now a tranquil place for individuals, visitors and collective contemplation, the park is open to the public daily.

=== Not LGBT-friendly ===
Despite its active nightlife and prevailing [[joie de vivre]], Lagos, like all cities in Nigeria, is "not LGBT-friendly". [[Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act 2013|Nigeria's 2014 legislation]] in this regard is among the most draconian systems of repression against queer people in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Isaack |first=Wendy |date=20 October 2016 |title=Tell Me Where I Can Be Safe |url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/10/20/tell-me-where-i-can-be-safe/impact-nigerias-same-sex-marriage-prohibition-act |website=hrw.org |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |language=en}}</ref> Homosexuals, but also their "supporters" such as people who have attended a same-sex wedding in another country, or hotel staff who have provided a room for a queer couple, theoretically can be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison.

== Culture ==
Lagos is a cultural centre of Nigeria. As a [[Port|port city]] and the starting point of [[British Empire|British colonisation]], the Western influence is stronger here than in probably any other Nigerian city. All Nigerian ethnic groups can be found in the [[melting pot]] of this [[metropolis]], with the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] predominating. The [[Music of Nigeria|music]] and [[Cinema of Nigeria|film]] industries in the city are dynamic centres of the country with international acclaim.

Another frequently photographed structure in Lagos is the [[Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge]] – or more simply: Lekki bridge.

The [[Cathedral Church of Christ, Lagos|Cathedral Church of Christ]] is at the centre of the oldest part of Lagos. The Anglican church was built between 1867 and 1869, shortly after the establishment of British colonial rule.

The Surulere district is the centre of the Nigerian film industry, commonly referred to as Nollywood. Lagos itself is the location and setting for many films.

The film ''[[93 Days]]'' with [[Danny Glover]] is a somewhat melodramatic but fact-based account of the [[Ebola in Nigeria|Ebola outbreak in Lagos in 2014]] and was filmed at original locations.

Since the success of the Nigerian thriller ''The Figurine'', Nigerian film has increasingly focused on high-quality productions that are also commercially successful. This, in turn, has led to ever-new records in box office takings in Nigeria (2009: "The Figurine", 2013: "Half of a Yellow Sun", 2016: "The Wedding Party").<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ademola |first=Bisi |date=20 June 2023 |title=Nollywood: Blockbusters To Streaming Success {{!}} African Folder |url=https://africanfolder.com/nollywood-streaming-success/ |access-date=28 June 2023 |language=en-US}}</ref>

In some parts of Lagos, residents have one of the highest standards of living in Nigeria and in Africa.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ogunlesi |first=Tolu |date=4 May 2014 |title=Commercial hub status of Lagos sparks a chain reaction |newspaper=Financial Times |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/66249de4-bb16-11e3-948c-00144feabdc0.html |url-status=live |url-access=subscription |access-date=17 March 2016 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221210221254/https://www.ft.com/content/66249de4-bb16-11e3-948c-00144feabdc0#axzz439BBFQBZ |archive-date=10 December 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=21 October 2013 |title=Luxury living in Lagos |publisher=CNBC Africa |url=http://www.cnbcafrica.com/insights/special-reports/real-estate/the-rise-of-luxury-living-in-lagos/ |access-date=16 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319211227/http://www.cnbcafrica.com/insights/special-reports/real-estate/the-rise-of-luxury-living-in-lagos |archive-date=19 March 2016}}</ref>

Reliable data on [[unemployment]], [[Poverty threshold|income below the subsistence level]], etc. are hardly available for Lagos – as for the whole region – and must be taken with scepticism where they are provided, e.g. in other articles (see also the previous chapter). The reason for this is the widespread "''[[informal economy]]''" (not to be confused with "[[Black market|shadow economy]]") in West Africa. Insufficient jobs in traditional wage labour force people to look for work elsewhere. This benefits the informal sector of the economy, where there is no minimum wage and workers pay no taxes, have no holiday or labour rights and often work in unsafe conditions.<ref name=":11">{{Cite web |last=Onigbinde |first=Oluseun |title=LAGOS' INFORMAL SECTOR Taxation & Contribution to the Economy |url=https://ng.boell.org/sites/default/files/uploads/2017/02/budgit_final_report_30.1.17.pdf |access-date=1 February 2017 |publisher=Heinrich Böll Foundation (Nigeria)}}</ref>

According to the [[International Monetary Fund]], about 5.5 million people are employed in the informal economy in Lagos State alone – about three quarters of Lagos' workforce.<ref name=":12">{{Cite web |title=THE INFORMAL ECONOMY IN NIGERIA – THISDAYLIVE |url=https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2022/07/11/the-informal-economy-in-nigeria |access-date=19 August 2023 |website=thisdaylive.com |language=en}}</ref> Throughout Lagos, one can observe street vendors, artisans, sellers, small and micro enterprises, shared taxis, tricycles and motorbikes (okada drivers), domestic workers, market traders<ref name=":11" /> and others engaged in the informal sector.

Activities in the informal economy are not included in economic statistics. As a result, the wealth of the population, but also e.g. unemployment, is significantly underestimated if the massive informal economy is not taken into account.<ref name=":12" />

Strikingly, according to the NST, Nigeria's two largest cities, Lagos and [[Kano (city)|Kano]], are significantly ''safer'' than rural areas when it comes to homicides. For Lagos State, the NST shows 135 such violent deaths in the past 24 months (as of July 2023), or 5.6 annually for every million inhabitants (for comparison, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdoms]]' crime statistics in 2022 counted 10 homicides per million inhabitants<ref>{{Cite web |title=UK homicide rate 2022 |url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/288195/homicide-rate-uk/ |access-date=19 August 2023 |website=Statista |language=en}}</ref> or [[Turkey|Turkey's]] 24<ref>{{Cite web |title=Türkei – Mordrate |url=https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/693588/umfrage/mordrate-in-der-tuerkei/ |access-date=19 August 2023 |website=Statista |language=de}}</ref>). For Nigeria as a whole, this figure is 93, with 62% of these cases attributable to [[Police brutality|police violence]] (mainly [[Vigilantism|vigilante justice]]).

=== Air traffic ===
[[File:MMIA_Intl_Terminal_2019.jpg|thumb|[[Murtala Muhammed International Airport]]]]
Lagos is served by [[Murtala Muhammed International Airport]], one of the largest and [[List of the busiest airports in Africa|busiest airports in Africa]]. The MMIA is Nigeria's premier international air gateway. The airport's history dates back to colonial times, around the time of the Second World War. The international airport terminal was built and commissioned over 40 years ago, in 1978. The terminal opened officially on 15 March 1979. The airport had been known simply as the Lagos International Airport. It was, however, renamed for the late Nigerian Head of State, General Murtala Muhammed, who died in 1976.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Murtala Ramat Mohammed {{!}} head of state of Nigeria {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Murtala-Ramat-Mohammed |access-date=12 March 2022 |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |language=en |archive-date=12 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220312185339/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Murtala-Ramat-Mohammed |url-status=live }}</ref>

The airport terminal has been renovated several times since the 1970s but its most radical makeover began in 2013, following the launch of the Federal government's multi-billion naira Remodelling/ Rehabilitation Programme for its airports nationwide. Under the re-modeling work there, by late in 2014, the MMA lounge area had been expanded to four times its previous size and new passenger handling conveyor systems were installed which can handle over 1,000 passengers per hour.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}<ref>{{Cite web |last=TrekLondon |date=14 August 2023 |title=Lagos Air Traffic |url=https://treklondon.co.uk/lagos-air-traffic/ |access-date=19 September 2023 |website=Trek London.Uk |language=en-GB}}</ref>

A second airport, [[Lekki-Epe International Airport]] has been approved by the Federal Government in April 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |title=FG approves the Lekki-Epe International Airport.

=== Sewage ===
An efficient sewage system is lacking. Sewage is flushed into the open sewerage system by rainwater. This water then carries pollutants into rivers and the lagoon. Sewage also enters groundwater through leaking septic tanks and latrines. The contaminants can then contaminate the water in wells and boreholes. Water sold by street vendors can also be affected, as it comes from the same sources.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lagos Water Supply and Pollution |url=https://www.internetgeography.net/topics/lagos-water-supply-and-pollution/ |access-date=19 August 2023 |website=Internet Geography |language=en-GB}}</ref>
