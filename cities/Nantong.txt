'''Nantong'''{{efn|{{zh|c=南通|p=Nántōng}}; alternate names: Nan-t'ung, Nantung, Tongzhou, or Tungchow; [[Qihai dialect]]: {{IPA-wuu|nie tʰoŋ|}}}} is a [[prefecture-level city]] in southeastern [[Jiangsu]] [[province of China|province]], China. Located on the northern bank of the [[Yangtze River]], near the river mouth. Nantong is a vital river port bordering [[Yancheng]] to the north; [[Taizhou, Jiangsu|Taizhou]] to the west; [[Suzhou]], [[Wuxi]] and [[Shanghai]] to the south across the river; and the [[East China Sea]] to the east. Its population was 7,726,635 as of the 2020 census, 3,766,534 of whom lived in the built-up area made up of three urban districts.

In September 26, 2004, the first World Metropolitan Development Forum was held in Nantong. In 2005, Nantong had a [[GDP]] growth of 15.4%, the highest growth rate in Jiangsu province, and in 2016 Nantong's GDP had a total of about 675 billion yuan, ranking 21st in the whole country.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

Although the city took a blow from the economic depression of the 1930s, as well as the Japanese occupation of the 1930s and 40s, Nantong has remained an important center for the textile industry. Because of its deepwater harbor and connections to inland navigational canals, it was one of 14 port cities opened to foreign investment in recent Chinese economic reforms.

Because the coast of the [[East China Sea]] is constantly expanding eastward as the [[Yangtze River]] adds silt to its delta, the distance between Nantong and the seashore is getting longer than it once was in ancient times.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

In May 2021, a violent storm hit the city, leaving 11 people dead, and a further 102 people injured. According to authorities, many homes were badly damaged during the storm, and more than 3,000 people were evacuated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/eleven-dead-and-thousands-evacuated-after-massive-thunderstorm-hits-chinas-east-coast-12292107|title = China storm: Eleven dead and thousands evacuated after massive thunderstorm hits Nantong}}</ref> They were among many other cities on China's east coast that were affected.

Nantong has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), with four distinct seasons. Winters are chilly and damp, and cold northwesterly winds caused by the [[Siberian high]] can force temperatures to fall below freezing at night although snowfall is relatively uncommon. Summers are hot and humid, and downpours or freak thunderstorms often occur. Monthly daily average temperatures range from {{convert|3.6|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|27.9|°C|1}} in July, and the annual mean is {{convert|16.2|°C|1}}. With the [[plum rain]]s in June and early July comes the rainiest part of the year.

==History==
===Ancient era===
Because the coast of the [[East China Sea]] is constantly expanding eastward as the [[Yangtze River]] adds silt to its delta, the distance between Nantong and the seashore is getting longer than it once was in ancient times.

The area that is now Nantong was originally part of the [[state of Wu]] during the [[Spring and Autumn period]], which was later conquered by the [[state of Yue]] in 473&nbsp;BC. After yet again being subjected to a new foreign rule by the [[state of Chu]] in 334&nbsp;BC, the inhabitants of present-day Nantong would again experience another regime change during the [[Qin's wars of unification|first unification of China]] by the [[state of Qin]].

===Imperial era===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2023}}
[[file:Temple_of_Mystery_of_Nantong_01_2013-01.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Xuanmiao Temple, a [[Song dynasty]] architectural relic built in 1009, located in [[Chongchuan District]].]]
From the [[Han dynasty]] up until the [[Tang dynasty]], what is now called Nantong was a minor city county subordinate to [[Yangzhou]]. By AD&nbsp;958, that city county had already gained sufficient importance for it to be upgraded to an independent prefecture called '''Tongzhou''' ("Opening Prefecture", possibly from its position near the mouth of the [[Yangtze]]) to be created. The increasing wealth of Yangzhou caused Tongzhou to be once again eclipsed as an administrative center in 1368.

When Tongzhou finally regained prefecture status in 1724 during the [[Qing dynasty]], it was renamed to its present name Nantong ("Southern Tong") to avoid confusion with another administrative division also named Tongzhou, located near Beijing.

===Modern era===
Nantong was the first place in China to be developed into a modern city after the collapse of the Qing dynasty, and was also the birthplace of China's modern industry.{{citation needed|date=April 2023}}

The prosperity of Nantong has traditionally depended on salt production on the nearby seacoast, rice and cotton agriculture, and manufacture of cotton and silk textiles, especially [[Nantong blue calico]].{{citation needed|date=April 2023}} A local statesman and industrialist named [[Zhang Jian (politician)|Zhang Jian]] founded Nantong's first modern cotton mills in 1899. He then developed an industrial complex that included flour, oil, and silk reeling mills, a distillery, and a machinery shop.{{citation needed|date=April 2023}} He also founded a shipping line and reclaimed saline agricultural land to the east of Nantong for cotton production. Thanks to these efforts, by 1911 Nantong was commonly called "Zhang Jian's Kingdom". In the early [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republican]] period, the Nantong Special Administrative District included [[Chongming County]], now part of [[Shanghai]].<ref name=eos>[http://zhuanti.shanghai.gov.cn/encyclopedia/en/Default2.aspx#50 "Chongming County" in the ''Encyclopedia of Shanghai'', pp.&nbsp;50&nbsp;ff.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302131933/http://zhuanti.shanghai.gov.cn/encyclopedia/en/Default2.aspx |date=2013-03-02 }} Shanghai Scientific & Technical Publishers (Shanghai), 2010.

==Language==
{{main|Nantong dialect}}
Nantong city and its six counties (or [[county-level cities]]) are rich in linguistic diversity, featuring both important Northern Wu varieties and highly divergent dialects of Mandarin (see [[Nantong dialect]]). People in the city of Nantong speak a unique dialect which sounds nothing like standard Mandarin or any other dialect, and it also holds distinctive differences from surrounding dialects. 

About 2 million people in the southern parts of [[Tongzhou District, Nantong|Tongzhou]], [[Haimen]], and [[Qidong City|Qidong]] speak the [[Wu language]], the specific local variety of which is often referred to as "Qi-hai Hua" ({{linktext|lang=zh-hans|启|海|话}}), meaning Qidong-Haimen speech. It is about the same as the dialect spoken on the neighbouring island of [[Chongming Island|Chongming]], [[Shanghai]]. People in northern parts of these counties speak the "Tongdong dialect" ({{zh|s={{linktext|通|东|话}}|p=Tōngdōnghuà|l="Eastern Tong Talk"}}. People in Rugao, Hai'an speak other dialects.

==Tourism==
The Hao River, known as the Emerald Necklace of Nantong, surrounds the city with a total length of {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}}. Most city scenery lines this river.<ref>{{cite news

Popular tourist sites include [[Langshan (Nantong)|Langshan]] ("Wolf Hill"), which is around 110 meters high. On top of the hill is a Buddhist temple dedicated to a [[Song dynasty]] monk. Because of the monk's legendary powers over water demons, sailors pray to him for protection on their voyages.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

The Cao Gong Zhu Memorial Temple commemorates a local hero who defended the city against Japanese pirates in 1557.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

Shuihuiyuan Garden, meaning Water Garden, is unique of all Chinese classical gardens due its creation in the Hui style. It includes the tombs of several notable people, such as Luo Binwang, a famous poet of the Tang dynasty; Wen Tianxiang, the national hero of the Nansong dynasty; and Zhang Jian, the top scholar of the late Qing dynasty, who was a modern industrialist and supporter of education.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

Nantong was historically known as an agricultural area and a traditional site for salt-making.{{Citation needed|date=February 2023}} Its principal agricultural products include cotton, silk, rice, wheat, fishing, fruits, rice wine, and more. Currently, the city is making efforts to upgrade its farming sectors and increase production of organic foods.{{citation needed|date=March 2023}}

Nantong is one of the 14 port cities opened to foreign investment projects under China's current policies of modernization. Nantong was traditionally an industrial city, especially around the turn of the 20th century, specializing in salt and cotton textile production. Today's industrial corporations have made Nantong into an industrial hub since it opened its door to the outside world in the 1990s. With its excellent geographic location and the completion of two Yangtze River bridges, the prefecture is attracting more investment funding nationwide.{{citation needed|date=April 2023}} Many of these investments come from international corporations. In October 2007, Singapore RGM International signed an agreement with Rudong, a county under Nantong's jurisdiction, to invest in a port project, costing 9 billion Yuan or US$1.33 billion, at Rudong Yangkou Port.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

Today, Nantong is one of many fast-growing coastal cities in China.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}} With the opening of [[Sutong Bridge]] in April 2008 and [[Chonghai Bridge]] in 2009, the city has been listed as the number one city in the [[Yangtze River Delta Economic Zone]] for foreign investment, surpassing its rivals Suzhou, Hangzhou and Nanjing.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

As a sprawling metropolis, Nantong has experienced environment damage from its industrialization as well. The municipal government has been putting stiffer environmental policies into practice over the years and has spent tremendous amounts of money to curb pollution and plant more trees along its roads. The city is active in shutting down factories that do not meet its environment laws.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

Nantong has developed rapidly in the last 25 years, as have most of the cities in the [[Yangtze River Delta]]. Nantong's rapid economic growth is generally attributed to its advantageous location just north of [[Shanghai]]. Nantong's Sutong Bridge is expected to further Nantong's integration with Shanghai, cutting transportation time between the cities down from three hours to one hour.<ref>{{cite news
