'''Escondido''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Hidden") is a city in [[San Diego County, California]], United States.  Located in the [[North County (San Diego area)|North County]] region, it was incorporated in 1888, and is one of the oldest cities in San Diego County. It has a population of 151,038 as of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]].

==Etymology==
"Escondido" is a Spanish word meaning "hidden". One source says the name originally referred to ''agua escondida'' or hidden water or valley;<ref>{{cite book|last=Fetzer|first=Leland|title=San Diego County Place Names A to Z|year=2005|publisher=Sunbelt Publications Inc.|location=San Diego|isbn=978-0-932653-73-4|pages=44–45}}</ref> another says it meant "hidden treasure".<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

==History==
The Escondido area was first settled by the [[Luiseño people|Luiseño]], who established campsites and villages along the creek running through the area. They named the place Mixéelum Pompáwvo or "Mehel-om-pom-pavo." The Luiseno also had another village north of Mixéelum Pompáwvo called Panakare.<ref>{{Cite web|title=American Indian Studies Program Provides Powerful Testimonial – Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)|url=https://www2.palomar.edu/pages/dei/american-indian-studies-program-provides-powerful-testimonial/|access-date=December 6, 2020|website=www2.palomar.edu|archive-date=August 29, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210829165724/https://www2.palomar.edu/pages/dei/american-indian-studies-program-provides-powerful-testimonial/|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Kumeyaay]] migrated from areas near the [[Colorado River]], settling both in [[San Pasqual Valley]] and near the [[San Dieguito River]] in the southwestern and western portions of what is now Escondido. Most of the villages and campsites today have been destroyed by development and agriculture.<ref name="library">{{cite web| url=http://www.library.escondido.org/pioneer/history.htm| title=The History of Escondido| publisher=Escondido Public Library| access-date=August 5, 2010| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315105101/http://www.library.escondido.org/pioneer/history.htm| archive-date=March 15, 2007}}</ref>

===Spanish and Mexican eras===
[[File:SanPasqual.jpg|thumb|left|The 1846 [[Battle of San Pasqual]] was a battle between American and [[Californio]] forces during the [[Conquest of California|U.S. Conquest of California]].]]
Spain controlled the land from the late 18th century to the early 19th century, and established many [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] in [[California]] to convert the indigenous people. When [[Mexico]] gained its independence from Spain, the local land was divided into large [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]]. Most of what is now Escondido occupies the former [[Rancho Rincon del Diablo]] ("Devil's Corner"), a [[Ranchos of California|Mexican land grant]] given to Juan Bautista Alvarado (not the [[Juan Bautista Alvarado|governor]] of the same name) in 1843 by Governor [[Manuel Micheltorena]]. Alvarado was a [[regidor]] of Los Angeles at the time, and the first Regidor of [[Pueblo San Diego]]. The southern part of Escondido occupies the former [[Rancho San Bernardo (Snook)|Rancho San Bernardo]], granted in 1842 and 1845.<ref name="Rush">{{cite book| last=Rush| first=Philip S.| title=Some old ranchos and adobes| year=1965| location=San Diego, California| pages=46, 47| chapter=Rincon del Diablo| lccn=65021995}}</ref>

In 1846, during the [[Mexican–American War]], the [[Battle of San Pasqual]] was fought southeast of Escondido. This battle pitted Mexican forces under [[Andrés Pico]] (brother of then-California-governor [[Pío Pico]]) against Americans under [[Stephen W. Kearny]], [[Archibald Gillespie]], and [[Kit Carson]]. A [[Kit Carson Park|park in Escondido]] is named for Carson.

===American era===

The city was home to a largely Spanish-speaking population in the first census, taken in 1850 when California became a state. After statehood, non-Hispanic settlers came to Southern California in increasing numbers, many of them from the Midwestern states.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.californiahistoryteachers.com/blog/immigration-to-california-1850-1900 | title=Immigration to California: 1850-1900 }}</ref> The decade of the 1880s is known as the "Southern California Land Boom" because so many people moved to the state.

In 1853, pro-Southern [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] proposed dividing the state of California to create a new [[Territory of Colorado (California)|Territory of Colorado]] (at this time the territory that would become the state of [[Colorado]] was named "[[Jefferson Territory|Jefferson]]"). San Diego Judge Oliver S. Witherby suggested placing the capitol of the new territory in Rancho Rincon del Diablo. He envisioned a railroad connecting San Diego to [[Fort Yuma]] through an area about two miles (3&nbsp;km) south of the current Escondido site, heading east through San Pasqual. With a series of deeds in 1855 and 1856, the rancho was transferred from the heirs of Juan Bautista Alvarado to Witherby.<ref name="Rush"/> He planned to profit from the town that he believed would be established from the dividing point on the railroad below the eastern hills.<ref name="Stanford">{{cite journal| last=Stanford| first=Leland G.| year=1978| title=Devil's Corner and Oliver S.

With Witherby's vision of owning a bustling state capitol unrealized, he set up a mining operation on the rancho instead.<ref name="Stanford"/>

In 1868, Witherby sold the rancho for $8,000 to Edward McGeary and John, Josiah, and Matthew Wolfskill. McGeary owned half the rancho, while the three Wolfskill brothers each owned an equal share of the other half. John Wolfskill farmed sheep, horses, and cattle on the rancho for a number of years. Wolfskill had frequent conflicts with the Couts family, owners of the neighboring [[Rancho Guajome|Guajome]], [[Rancho Buena Vista (Felipe)|Buena Vista]], and [[Rancho San Marcos|San Marcos]] ranchos, over grazing lands and watering holes.<ref name="Rush"/>

In October 1883, a group of Los Angeles investors purchased Rancho Rincon del Diablo. This group sold the land to the newly formed Escondido Company in 1884. On December 18, 1885, investors incorporated the Escondido Land and Town Company, and in 1886 this company purchased the {{convert|12814|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} area for approximately $100,000.<ref name="Rush"/> Two years later, in 1888, Escondido was incorporated as a city; the vote was 64 in favor of cityhood with 12 votes against. Railroads such as the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe]] and [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] were laid in the 1880s. The opening of [[U.S. Route 395 (California)|U.S. Route 395]] in 1930 boosted economic growth in Escondido.

Escondido was primarily an agricultural community, growing muscat [[grapes]] initially. After a dam was built in 1894–1895 to form what is known today as Lake Wohlford, [[orange (fruit)|orange]] and [[lemons|lemon]] trees were planted in large numbers, as were [[olive]] and [[walnut]] trees. By the 1960s, [[avocado]]s became the largest local crop. Since the 1970s, Escondido has lost most of its agricultural land to housing developments, but still retains a significant agricultural presence in the San Pascual Valley, including vineyards, citrus orchards, and avocado orchards.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|37.0|sqmi|km2}}.  {{convert|36.8|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.2|sqmi|km2}} of it is water. The total area is 0.48% water.

Escondido is also bordered by [[San Marcos, California|San Marcos]] to the west and northern San Diego to the south.

The city contains several neighborhoods, including:
*[[File:Mark Skovorodko Photography - Downtown Escondido Aerial.jpg|alt=A sunset aerial view of Downtown Escondido, California.|thumb|Sunset aerial view of downtown Escondido]] Downtown Escondido centers on Grand Avenue between Centre City Parkway and the site of the old Palomar Hospital. The city's [[general plan]] defines the Downtown Specific Plan Area as approximately {{convert|460|acres|km2|1}} bounded by Centre City Parkway on the west, Hickory and Ivy Streets on the east, Washington Avenue on the north, and Fifth Avenue on the south, with an additional narrow section extending west along Valley Parkway to Interstate 15.<ref>{{Cite book| title=City of Escondido General Plan| chapter=II.

The [[Escondido Creek]] bisects the city. It originates at the {{ill|Lake Wohlford Dam|ceb|Lake Wohlford 834 Dam}} in the northeast, passes through downtown and leaves the city through the [[Harmony Grove, California|Harmony Grove]] area in the southwest before eventually emptying into the [[San Elijo Lagoon]]. The creek path through the city was developed into a concrete [[flood control channel]] in the 1960s. A Class I [[bicycle path]] runs along most of the channel's length.<ref>{{Cite report |first1=Karen |last1=Chieng |first2=Jason |last2=Andrews |first3=Katherine |last3=McNiel |first4=April Marshburn |last4=Miller |year=2010 |title=Revealing Escondido Creek |url=http://www.escondido.org/Data/Sites/1/media/pdfs/Neighborhood/RevealingEscondidoCreek.pdf |publisher=[[California State University, Pomona]] |page=62 |access-date=June 1, 2012 |archive-date=May 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506072551/http://www.escondido.org/Data/Sites/1/media/pdfs/Neighborhood/RevealingEscondidoCreek.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

The community of [[Valley Center, California|Valley Center]] is located just northeast of Escondido. [[San Pasqual Band of Diegueno Mission Indians|Valley View Casino]], owned by the [[San Pasqual Band of Diegueno Mission Indians]], is located in Valley Center.

Natural vegetation types in the Escondido area include [[chaparral]] brushland, [[California oak woodland|oak woodland]], riparian (stream) woodland, and [[grassland]]. The Daley Ranch Preserve north of the city provides a good location to view these natural vegetation types.

===Climate===
Escondido has a borderline [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Bsh'') and [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa'') with hot summers and cool, wet winters. Owing to its inland setting, it is considerably warmer than coastal cities like San Diego, Carlsbad or Oceanside during the summertime, and cooler in the winter. Yearly precipitation averages around {{convert|15|in|mm}} and can vary considerably from year to year. Rainfall totals are higher in the hills to the north and east, with {{Convert|20-24|in|mm}} falling in most areas above {{Convert|2,000|ft|m}} in elevation, and over {{Convert|30|in|mm}} on [[Palomar Mountain]], {{Convert|15|mi|km}} to the east. More than 80% of all precipitation takes place from November through March. Snow is virtually unheard of, though occasionally winter and springtime thunderstorms will drop small hail. The climate is mild enough to allow widespread cultivation of avocados and oranges. Escondido is located in a plant [[hardiness zone]] 10a. The hottest temperature recorded in Escondido was {{Convert|115|F|C}} on September 6, 2020. The coldest temperature recorded in Escondido was {{Convert|13|F|C}} on January 2, 1901, and January 7, 1913.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=sgx|title=National Weather Service – NWS San Diego|last=Team|first=National Weather Service Corporate Image Web|website=w2.weather.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=November 30, 2018|archive-date=April 26, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210426005251/https://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=sgx|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Dixon Lake===
{{Main|Dixon Lake, Escondido}}
Dixon Lake is located in the north of Escondido. It is a popular place for picnics, camping, and fishing. Dixon Lake has been granted an Aquaculture Permit by the State of California Department of Fish and Wildlife, so that fishing licenses are no longer required. However, all anglers eight years and older will need daily lake fishing permits, which are available at the concession stand. Throughout the year, the city keeps stocking different types of fish, which include bass, bluegill, carp, catfish, crappie, and trout. Each year the Trout Derby event is also hosted at Dixon Lake.<ref>{{cite web| title=Dixon Lake| url=http://www.escondido.org/dixon-lake.aspx| publisher=City of Escondido| access-date=July 10, 2017| archive-date=June 27, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627201704/https://www.escondido.org/dixon-lake.aspx| url-status=live}}</ref>
