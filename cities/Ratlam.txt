==History==
[[File:Ratan Singh of Ratlam.jpg|thumb|Maharaja Ratan Singh of Ratlam]]
{{more citations needed section|date=August 2020}}
[[Ratlam State]] was founded in 1652 by a great-grandson of Raja [[Udai Singh of Marwar|Udai Singh]] of [[Jodhpur State|Jodhpur]], namely Raja [[Ratan Singh Rathore]], son of Mahesh Das of [[Jalore]]. The latter, father, and son, had performed important military services for the Emperor [[Shah Jahan]] by defeating the Persians and Uzbeks in Afghanistan. In reward for their services and in recognition of their great deeds of valour, large territories in the south-western districts of Rajputana and northern Malwa were conferred on them. Their capital became Ratram (named after Raja Ratan Singh and his first son Ram Singh) which later got translated to Ratlam.

Maharaja [[Ratan Singh Rathore]] 1652/1658, courageous in youth, he gained [[Shah Jahan]]'s notice by calming the Emperors favourite elephant which had run amok in the Agra Palace Garden, fought for the Emperor against the Persians in Kabul and Qandahar, later in 1652, the Emperor substituted Jalore for the pargana of Ratlam and many other areas, and he became the first Raja of Ratlam his advisor was jasraj bahratt and chief commander was Parshurama ojha of [[Shrimali Brahmins]].<ref>Madhya Pradesh: Ratlam</ref> In 1658 a false rumour of the death of the Emperor resulted in a frenzied scramble for succession to the throne amongst his sons. Dara Shikoh who was officiating for his father, sent a combined army of Rajputs and Muslims under the command of Maharaja Jaswant Singh of Jodhpur, against his brother Aurangzeb. The Maharaja, as head of the Rathore clan, was persuaded to hand over command of the Imperial army to Maharaja Ratan Singh. Non-co-operation by the Muslim commanders resulted in the army sustaining heavy losses in the fierce battle at Dharmat, as well as the death of Ratan Singh (said to have sustained 80 sword wounds on his body).

Ratan Singh had married (among others), Maharani Sukhroopde Kanwar Shekhawat Ji Sahiba, daughter of Kunwar Purshottam Das of Jhajhar [<nowiki/>[[Shekhawati]]], and had an issue. He died in 1658 in battle at Dharmat near Ujjain.

The new town of Ratlam was founded in 1829 by Captain Borthwick.<ref>{{cite web |title=History |website=District Ratlam, Government of Madhya Pradesh |url=https://ratlam.nic.in/en/history/#:~:text=The%20New%20Town%20of%20Ratlam,for%20its%20bargains%20called%20Sattas |access-date=14 August 2020}}</ref>

Ratlam was one of the first commercial cities established in Central India. The city quickly became known for trading in [[opium]], tobacco, and salt, as well as for its bargains called "Sattas". Before the opening of the [[Rajputana-Malwa Railway|Rajputana State Railway]] to [[Khandwa]] in 1872, there was no better place to trade than in Ratlam.

The city is known for its love of food, its taste particularly the world popular salty snack 'Ratlami Sev'.

Ratlam was part of the Malwa Agency of Central India during the British Raj. The state's capital was Ratlam town in modern Ratlam district of Madhya Pradesh. Ratlam was originally a huge state, but the then ruler Ratan Singh opposed Aurangzeb in the Battle of Dharmatpur and was killed after a brave fight. The state was then reduced and the title of Maharaja has eventually stripped away; the title was later restored by the British during Maharaja Sajjan Singh's rule. On 5 January 1819 Ratlam State became a British protectorate.
