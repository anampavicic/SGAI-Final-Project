== Economy ==
Maramureș is known for its pastoral and agricultural traditions, largely unscathed by the [[industrialisation]] campaign carried out during Romania's [[Socialist Republic of Romania|communist period]]. Ploughing, planting, harvesting, and hay making and handling are mostly done through [[manual labour]]. The county is also home to a strong mining industry of extraction of metals other than iron. The industrial plants built around [[Baia Mare]] during the communist period heavily polluted the area in the past, but recently, due to the decline of the city's industrial activity, the area has become less polluted.

== Tourism ==
[[File:Maramures2.cristibur.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Typical Wooden Church in Maramureș]]
The region is known for its beautiful rural scenery, local small woodwork and craftwork industry as well as for its churches and original rural architecture. There are not many paved roads in the rural areas, but most of them are usually accessible.

The county's main tourist attractions are:
* The cities of [[Baia Mare]] and [[Sighetu Marmației]].
* The villages on the [[Iza (river)|Iza]], [[Mara (Iza)|Mara]], and [[Vișeu]] Valleys.
** The [[Wooden churches of Maramureș]]
** The wooden churches of {{ill|Lăpuș Country|ro|Țara Lăpușului}}
** The wooden churches of {{ill|Chioar Country|ro|Țara Chioarului}}
** The [[Merry Cemetery|Merry Cemetery of Săpânța]]
* The [[Rodna Mountains]], the [[Rodna Mountains National Park]], and the [[Maramureș Mountains Natural Park]]. 
* The landscape of [[Cavnic]].
* The [[Memorial of the Victims of Communism and of the Resistance]] in Sighetu Marmației.

===History===
{{Main|History of Maramureș}}

* In 1199, the region is first attested.
* In 1241 the Tatar invasion decimated about half of the local population.
* In the 14th century, Duke ([[knyaz]]) [[Bogdan I of Moldavia|Bogdan]] of Maramureș crossed the Carpathians and founded the Principality of [[Moldavia]]. In 1343, the [[Voivodeship of Maramureș]], led by a Romanian nobility, is established, and it lasts until 1402.
* In the Middle Ages, the historical region of Máramaros ([[Maramureș]]) was known for its salt mines and later for its lumber.

In 1920, under the [[Treaty of Trianon]], the northern part of the county became part of newly-formed [[Czechoslovakia]], while the southern part (including [[Sighetu Marmației]]) became part of the [[Kingdom of Romania]].

After the administrative unification law in 1925, the county remained as it was, with an identical name and territory.

In 1938, [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] promulgated a new [[1938 Constitution of Romania|Constitution]], and subsequently he had the administrative division of the Romanian territory changed. Ten {{lang|ro|[[Former administrative divisions of Romania#Ținuturi: 1938 - 1940|ținuturi]]}} (approximate translation: "lands") were created (by merging the counties) to be ruled by {{lang|ro|rezidenți regali}} (approximate translation: "Royal Residents") – appointed directly by the king – instead of the [[Prefect (Romania)|prefects]]. Maramureș County became part of [[Ținutul Crișuri]].

In August 1940, under the auspices of [[Nazi Germany]], which imposed the [[Second Vienna Award]], the county was transferred back to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]] with the rest of [[Northern Transylvania]]. In October 1944, Romanian forces with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] assistance recaptured the ceded territory and reintegrated it into Romania, re-establishing the county. Romanian jurisdiction over the county per the Treaty of Trianon was reaffirmed in the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947]]. The counties of Romania, including Maramureș, were disestablished by the [[Socialist Republic of Romania|communist government]] of Romania in 1950 in favour of [[Regions of the People's Republic of Romania|regions]], and re-established in 1968 when Romania restored the county administrative system.

===Administration===
[[File:1938 map of interwar county Maramures.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Map of Maramureș County as constituted in 1938.]]
In 1930, the county was originally divided into three districts (''[[plasă|plăși]]''):<ref name=Memoria>[http://romaniainterbelica.memoria.ro/judete/maramures/ Portretul României Interbelice - Județul Maramureș]</ref>
#Plasa Iza
#Plasa Sighet (headquartered at [[Sighet]])
#Plasa Vișeu (headquartered at [[Vișeu de Sus]])

Subsequently, the Iza and Sighet districts were reorganized into three districts, adding one:
<ol start="4">
<li>Plasa Șugatag (headquartered at [[Ocna Șugatag]])</li>
</ol>

=== Population ===
According to the 1930 census, the county's population was 194,619, 57.9% Romanian, 20.9% Jews, 11.9% Ruthenians (including Ukrainians), 6.9% Hungarians, 2.0% Germans, as well as other minorities.<ref name=Rec_1930_276>Recensământul general al populației României din 29 decemvrie 1930, Vol. II, pag. 276-277</ref> The following composition was recorded from the religious point of view: 64.4% Greek Catholic, 21.0% Jewish, 6.4% Roman Catholic, 5.3% Eastern Orthodox, 1.8% Reformed, as well as other minorities.<ref name=Rec_1930_276/>

==== Urban population ====
In 1930 the county's urban population ethnically consisted of 38.6% Jews, 35.4% Romanians, 19.9% Hungarians, 4.5% Ruthenians (including Ukrainians), as well as other minorities.
