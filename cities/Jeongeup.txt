'''Jeongeup''' ({{Korean|hangul=정읍}}; {{IPA|ko|tɕʌŋ.ɯp̚}}), also known as '''Jeongeup-si''', is a [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|city]] in [[North Jeolla]] Province, [[South Korea]]. The city limits include [[Naejang-san]] National Park, a popular destination particularly in autumn due to its foliage.  Jeongeup is on the [[Honam Expressway]] and [[Honam Line]], with the [[Seohaean Expressway]] also within easy reach, providing links to [[Seoul]] and [[Mokpo]].

==Demographics==
Jeongeup's population is in decline, with an average of 56 people moving to the city every day but 91 leaving, with the birth and death rates being equal. The divorce rate currently runs at 50%.<ref name="Demographic statistics">{{cite web|url=http://www.jeongeup.go.kr/english/open/open_2_7.jsp |script-title=ko:녹두꽃피고 파랑새나는 정읍 만들기 |work=Jeongeup City Council |access-date=5 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050215130012/http://www.jeongeup.go.kr/english/open/open_2_7.jsp |archive-date=15 February 2005 }}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:내장산 남창계곡.jpg|thumb|left|Namchang Valley, Naejangsan]]
The main hills in Jeongeup are [[Naejang-san]] National Park and Ibamsan, though there are also several smaller hills in the city. It is the east of the city which is more mountainous, the west being a plain around the Dongjin River.  There are several streams in Jeongeup, most notably the Jeongeupcheon, a tributary of the Dongjin. This over went a makeover by the city council in December 2009.

==Attractions==
Jeongeup, like many cities in Korea, had a ''hyanggyo'', or [[Confucianism|Confucian]] school, where people were trained in Confucian ways. This building is a tourist attraction today, but is not open to the public.

Jeongeup is known for a traditional song from the [[Baekje]] Kingdom era, known as Jeongeup-ga. The song tells the tale of the lamenting heart of a woman waiting for her peddler husband's return.

Naejangsa Temple: first erected in 636, but most of its current buildings were built after the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|Japanese invasions of Korea]] in 1597 and the Korean War.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cin|first=Woo Lee|url=http://travel.cnn.com/seoul/visit/33-beautiful-temples-enlightenment-857401|title=Simply stunning: 33 incredible Korean temples|publisher=CNN Travel|date=10 February 2012|access-date=2012-04-12|archive-date=5 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705061157/http://travel.cnn.com/seoul/visit/33-beautiful-temples-enlightenment-857401|url-status=live}}</ref> On 31 October 2012, the temple was destroyed in a fire that broke out.<ref>{{cite news|title=Temple lost to fire|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_entertainment/558571.html|access-date=25 February 2013|newspaper=[[The Hankyoreh]]|date=1 November 2012|archive-date=21 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421101713/http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_entertainment/558571.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Festivals==
A maple festival around [[Naejang-san]] is held annually. The maple leaves here are widely regarded as some of the most beautiful in the country. The festival was abolished in 2002 but was revived in 2007.<ref>[Wonderful maple of Naejang mountain] {{lang|ko-Hang|내장산 단풍… 마냥 고와서 문득 서러워라 국민일보}}2007.11.01</ref>{{full citation needed|date=November 2020}} This festival includes several events regarding the [[chrysanthemum]] love.

Additionally, a century ago, Jeongeup was the site of a revolution by the religious movement of [[Cheondoism]]. A lot of peasants joined the movement against the Japanese invaders. For this, Jeongeup holds an annual ceremony to commemorate the event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://honam.jeongeup.go.kr/eng/nongak/no_1sub01.html|title="Welcome to honam Udo nongak"|access-date=26 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050110002055/http://honam.jeongeup.go.kr/eng/nongak/no_1sub01.html|archive-date=10 January 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref>
