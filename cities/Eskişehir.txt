== History ==
[[File:Cybele Figure with lions (Roman period) - 3.jpg|180px|thumb|left|[[Cybele]] Statue (30 BC - 395 AD) excavated from the Ancient City of [[Pessinus]] exhibited in the [[Eskişehir Eti Archaeology Museum|Eskişehir Archeology Museum]].]]
[[File:Nasuh Al-Silahi - View of Eskisehir.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Miniature view of Eskişehir in the 16th century during the [[Ottoman Empire]].]]

The city was founded by the [[Phrygians]] in at least 1000 [[Anno Domini|BC]], although it has been estimated to be older than 4000 years old. The current city lies about a mile from the ancient Phrygian city of [[Dorylaeum]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Many Phrygian artifacts and sculptures can still be found in the city's archeological museum. There is also a museum of [[meerschaum]] stone, whose production remains still notable, used to make high quality meerschaum [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|pipes]]. In the fourth century AD the city moved about ten km northeast, from Karacahisar to Şehirhöyük. The region was originally inhabited by [[Hittites]].

Many ancient geographers described the city as one of the most beautiful in [[Anatolia]].{{CN|date=December 2021}}

As with many towns in [[Anatolia]], [[Christianity]] arrived after [[Constantine the Great]] legalized the [[religion]] in the [[Roman Empire]]. Beginning in the 4th century, records exist of bishops holding office in Eskişehir. The city was known as {{lang|grc-Latn|Dorylaeum}} ({{lang|grc|Δορύλαιον}}) in [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] in that period. One of these bishops, [[Eusebius of Dorylaeum|Eusebius]], was heavily involved in shaping the evolving [[dogma]] of the church.

It was called {{lang|tr|Sultanönü}} during the [[Seljuks|Seljuk]] period.<ref name="tia">Türkiye İller Ansiklopedisi 1.Cilt s.409</ref> In 1097 it was the site of a [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)|battle]] of the [[First Crusade]] in which the [[Crusaders]] defeated the Seljuk Turkish sultan [[Kilij Arslan I]]; the town later fell to the [[Seljuks|Turks]] in 1176, or the 13th century.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} From 1867 until 1922, Eskişehir was part of [[Hüdavendigâr vilayet]]. In 1921, it was captured by the invading [[Greek Army]]. Eskişehir holds the title of Cultural Capital of the Turkish World and UNESCO Capital of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2013.

== Geography ==
The city of Eskişehir is sited on the banks of [[Porsuk River]], which flows into the [[Sakarya River]]. [[Porsuk Dam]], located near the Eskişehir-Kütahya border controls the flow of the water in the river.

==Economy==
Traditionally dependent on flour milling and brickyards, the city expanded with the building of railway workshops in 1894 for work on the [[Berlin–Baghdad railway]]. 

As of 1920, Eskişehir was one of the major locations for [[meerschaum]] mining. At that time, most of the mining sites were owned by the state.<ref name="Prothero105">{{cite book |last=Prothero |first=G.W. |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11766/view/1/105/ |title=Anatolia |publisher=H.M. Stationery Office |year=1920 |location=London |page=105}}</ref>

[[Devrim]], the first Turkish automobile, was produced in 1961 at the [[TÜLOMSAŞ]] factory in Eskişehir. [[Devrim]] never put into mass production and stayed a concept study and can be viewed in TÜLOMSAŞ factory Eskişehir. In addition to production, first Turkish steam powered locomotive called [[Karakurt (locomotive)|Karakurt]] was produced at the TÜLOMSAŞ in 1961. Eskişehir was also the site of Turkey's first aviation industry (Aeronautical Supply Maintenance Centre) and its [[air base]] was the command center of Turkey's first [[Turkish Air Force|Tactical Air Force headquarters]] on [[NATO]]'s southern flank during the [[Cold War]].
