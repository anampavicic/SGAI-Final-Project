'''Metro''' ({{IPA|id|Me'tro}}) is a [[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia|city]] in the [[Indonesia]]n [[Provinces of Indonesia|province]] of [[Lampung]]. It is 52&nbsp;km away from [[Bandar Lampung|Bandar Lampung City]] (the provincial capital), and is the second largest city in Lampung province. This city is also the city that has the lowest congestion rate in Lampung Province. Metro is included in the List of 10 cities in Indonesia with the 9th lowest cost of living in Indonesia and second on Sumatra Island based on the Indonesia Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) Survey in 2017. Metro is also a blueprint target of the Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing of Indonesia as a strategic area and a metropolitan development target after Bandar Lampung.

==Etymology==
The first version of the name Metro comes from the word "Meterm" in Dutch which means "center" which means in the middle between Central Lampung and East Lampung, even in the middle (center) of Lampung Province. The second version of the name Metro comes from the word "Mitro" (Javanese) which means friends, partners, associations, this was motivated by colonization coming from various regions outside Sumatra that entered Lampung.<ref name="Sudarmono28">{{harvnb|Sudarmono|Edi Ribut Harwanto|2004|p=28}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Prahana|1997|p=20}}</ref>  But the most relevant was Metro was from Dutch, it was strongly supported with its history and the establishment of a landmark in the form of a tower called the Meterm Tower in the Merdeka Park, Metro City Square. <!--There is no such word in Dutch--><!-- However, due to Metro’s central position between Rancangpurwo and Adipuro, the name Metro is sometimes thought to have come from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word ''meterm'', meaning center.<ref name="Sudarmono28"/>-->

==History==
[[File:Settlers in Metro, 1939.jpg|left|thumb|Settlers arrive in Metro, ''c.'' 1939]]
Prior to 1936, Trimurjo was part of Gunungsugih ''onder district'';<ref>{{harvnb|Sudarmono|Edi Ribut Harwanto|2004|p=18}}</ref> it was isolated, without much influence from the indigenous Lampungese people.<ref>{{harvnb|Sudarmono|Edi Ribut Harwanto|2004|p=2}}</ref> However, beginning in 1936 the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]] sent [[Javanese people|Javanese]] migrants to colonise the area, which served to relieve [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] on [[Java]], and mitigate the influence of [[Indonesian independence]] activists.<ref>{{harvnb|Sudarmono|Edi Ribut Harwanto|2004|p=25}}</ref> The first group arrived on 4 April 1936.<ref name="Sudarmono 2004 20">{{harvnb|Sudarmono|Edi Ribut Harwanto|2004|p=20}}</ref>

On 9 June 1937, the name of the area was changed from Trimurjo to Metro<ref name="Sudarmono28"/> and that same year it was established as a separate ''onder district'', with Raden Mas Sudarto as the first assistant district chief. During this same period the Dutch colonial government built more roads, as well as a clinic, police office, and administrative offices.<ref>{{harvnb|Sudarmono|Edi Ribut Harwanto|2004|pp=29–30}}</ref> By 1941 a mosque, post office, large market, and inn had been built, and electricity and telephone lines had been installed.<ref>{{harvnb|Sudarmono|Edi Ribut Harwanto|2004|p=30}}</ref>

Development soon outpaced the natural [[irrigation]] capabilities of the area. To ensure proper healthy crops, the Dutch hired Ir. Swam to design an irrigation system. His design called for a [[levee]] as well as a {{convert|30|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|10|m|ft}} deep irrigation canal from [[Way Sekampung River]] to Metro. Labour was provided by the migrants, who were conscripted and worked in shifts. Construction began in 1937 and was finished in 1941.<ref>{{harvnb|Sudarmono|Edi Ribut Harwanto|2004|pp=31–39}}</ref>

After the Japanese invasion of Indonesia in 1942, all Dutch personnel were evacuated or captured.<ref name="Sudarmono4850"/> The migration program was continued under the name ''imin kakari'',<ref name="Sudarmono 2004 54">{{harvnb|Sudarmono|Edi Ribut Harwanto|2004|p=54}}</ref> and seventy Javanese migrants were used as forced labour in the construction of the nearby Natar and Astra Ksetra airstrips as well as numerous bunkers and other strategic assets; those who resisted were shot.<ref name="Sudarmono4850">{{harvnb|Sudarmono|Edi Ribut Harwanto|2004|pp=48–50}}</ref>

The remaining citizens were malnourished, with their harvests being taken by the Japanese occupying forces. Diseases spread rampantly throughout the populace, carried by ticks. Deaths were common, as were women, including wives of the forced labourers, being taken as [[comfort women]].<ref name="Sudarmono 2004 54"/>

During the [[Indonesian war of independence]], the Dutch attempted to retake Metro. When they first arrived, they were unable to enter as the bridge to the city in Tempuran had been destroyed by a 26-man troop of the [[Tentara Nasional Indonesia|Indonesian army]], under the command of [[Second Lieutenant]] Bursyah; the Dutch convoy was forced to retreat. However, the following day the Dutch returned in greater numbers and attacked from Tegineneng, eventually entering the city and killing three Indonesian soldiers.<ref>{{harvnb|Sudarmono|Edi Ribut Harwanto|2004|pp=58–59}}</ref>

Upon entering the city, the Dutch forces were besieged by sabotage by 41 soldiers under the command of Second Lieutenant Raden Sudarto. After chasing Sudarto's forces throughout the area, the Dutch continued to [[Palembang]]. Despite an extended guerrilla campaign by the Indonesian military, the Dutch eventually retook Metro in 1949, surrendering it that same year.<ref>{{harvnb|Sudarmono|Edi Ribut Harwanto|2004|pp=62–67}}</ref>

After the war, Metro continued to develop. In 1956, its government was stylized as a ''negeri'' based on Governor's Decree Number 153/D/1956. This led to [[adat]] lands being owned by the local government.<ref>{{harvnb|Sudarmono|Edi Ribut Harwanto|2004|p=71}}</ref>

In 1976 Metro became the capital of the newly formed [[Central Lampung Regency]], which at the time included parts of present-day [[East Lampung Regency]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sudarmono|Edi Ribut Harwanto|2004|p=72}}</ref>

[[File:Fountain in Metro town square.jpg|thumb|This fountain is one of the additions to the town square and has now been replaced by the Magnificent Meterm Tower|280x280px]]
Beginning in 1985, the local government began working to stimulate the economy. Retail chains began entering the city, a movie theatre and stadium was built, the town square was redesigned as a park, and Cendrawasih market was renovated.<ref>{{harvnb|Sudarmono|Edi Ribut Harwanto|2004|pp=76–79}}</ref>

On 14 August 1986, Metro was designated an administrative city, in accordance with Government Decree Number 34 of 1986, with the formal ceremony taking place on 6 September 1987.<ref>{{harvnb|Sudarmono|Edi Ribut Harwanto|2004|p=82}}</ref>

Metro was established as an autonomous city (''kota'') with the passing of Law Number 12 of 1999 on 27 April 1999,<ref name="Sudarmono 2004 93">{{harvnb|Sudarmono|Edi Ribut Harwanto|2004|p=93}}</ref> with [[Gunungsugih]] becoming the capital of Central Lampung.<ref>{{harvnb|Sudarmono|Edi Ribut Harwanto|2004|p=4}}</ref> The first mayor after Metro's establishment as an autonomous city was Mozes Herman, with Lukman Hakim as vice-mayor.<ref>{{harvnb|Sudarmono|Edi Ribut Harwanto|2004|p=84}}</ref>

==Geography and climate==
Metro is spread over an area of {{convert|73.21|km2|mi2}},<ref>{{harvnb|Sudarmono|Edi Ribut Harwanto|2004|p=137}}</ref> with the built up area consisting of 24.57% of the city, or {{convert|16.88|km2|mi2}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Sudarmono|Edi Ribut Harwanto|2004|p=120}}</ref> As of 2010, it had a population of 145,346, with a density of 2,116.2 people per km<sup>2</sup> (5,480.9/sq mi);<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> the 2020 census resulted in a population of 168,676, giving a density of 2,453.8 people per km<sup>2</sup> (6,355.5/sq mi).<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> The official estimate of population as at mid 2023 was 178,381 (comprising 89,678 males and 88,703 females).<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Metro Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.1872)</ref>
The city is built around the Dutch land use planning system. Its economic and political hub is in the center, in the area around the city park. All five provincial and national roads that transect Metro meet in this area.<ref>{{harvnb|Sudarmono|Edi Ribut Harwanto|2004|p=142}}</ref> Northern Metro is a residential area, while western Metro is used for commercial space, southern Metro for agriculture, and parts of southern and eastern Metro for educational and other public facilities.<ref>{{harvnb|Sudarmono|Edi Ribut Harwanto|2004|pp=144–145}}</ref>

==Administrative divisions==
[[File:PetaCamatMetro.jpg|thumb|District divisions of Metro]]
When Metro was originally made an autonomous city, it had two ''kecamatan'', or administrative districts, Metro Raya and Metro Bantul.<ref name="Sudarmono 2004 93"/> However, it now is divided into five districts (''[[kecamatan]]''), tabulated below with their populations at the 2010 census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and at the 2020 census,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> together with the official estimates as at mid 2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Metro Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.1872)</ref> The table also includes the number of [[administrative village]]s in each district (all classed as urban ''kelurahan'').
