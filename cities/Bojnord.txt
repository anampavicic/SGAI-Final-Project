== History ==
According to local tradition, the whole area was controlled by the [[Qarai Turks]] since the [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol invasion]] in the 13th century.<ref name=":0" />

Bojnurd is of recent origin and possibly built by the [[Safavid Iran|Safavids]] for the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] Şadiyan tribe who had been settled there to strengthen the Safavid borders against hostile [[Turkmens]]. Traditionally, the city was surrounded by a [[defensive wall]] and consisted of eleven quarters, [[bazaar]]s and four mosques.<ref name=":0" />

In 1849, the city saw a revolt which destroyed the city. When traveller G. C. Napier visited the city in 1876, it was noted that the chief of Bojnurd was a Kurd who governed the city without taxation in exchange for military support to the central government in [[Tehran]].<ref name=":0" />

Severe earthquakes in 1896 and 1929 destroyed the city and its surroundings. The city would consequently be rebuilt without historical or recent fortifications in a modern matter.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Ehlers|first=Eckart|last2=Bosworth|first2=C.
