'''Oceanside''' is a beach city in the [[North County (San Diego area)|North County]] area of [[San Diego County, California]]. The city had a population of 174,068 at the [[2020 United States census]], up from 167,086 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], making it the most populous city in the [[North County]] region of San Diego. The city is a popular tourist destination, owing to its historic landmarks, beaches, and architecture.

Oceanside's origins date to 1798, when the Spanish founded the village of [[San Luis Rey, Oceanside, California|San Luis Rey]] with the establishment of [[Mission San Luis Rey de Francia]] by [[Fermín de Lasuén]]. During the Spanish period, Mission San Luis Rey grew to be the largest of all the [[Spanish missions in California|Californian missions]], but following the [[Mexican secularization act of 1833]] the mission and its community declined. Following the [[Conquest of California|U.S. conquest of California]], the former mission lands were developed into an oceanfront resort and the community's name gradually changed to Oceanside.

==History==
[[File:"Mission San Luis Rey de Francia" (Christian Jörgensen, c. 1910; oil on canvas).jpg|thumb|left|Oceanside's origins date to 1798, when the Spanish founded [[Mission San Luis Rey de Francia]] under the leadership of [[Fermín de Lasuén]].]]
[[File:View of Mission San Luis Rey in 1827.jpg|thumb|left|The village of [[San Luis Rey, Oceanside, California|San Luis Rey]] and its mission in 1827]]
Originally inhabited by Native Americans, Oceanside was first settled by the [[Luiseño]] peoples, or the [[Payomkawichum]]. The city of Oceanside sits on the locality on the [[San Luis Rey River]] that the Luiseño called Tacayme, which contained the villages of Qée'ish (Keish) and 'ikáymay (Ikamal), in the San Luis Rey Mission area, Wiyóoya (Wiawio) at the mouth of the river, and Wi'áasamay (Wiasamai) and Waxáwmay (Wahaumai) at Guajome.<ref>CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY AND ASSESSMENT, MISSION/ACADEMY PLANNED DEVELOPMENT PLAN OCEANSIDE, SAN DIEGO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA https://www.ci.oceanside.ca.us/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?blobid=39420</ref>

===Spanish era===
The first European explorers arrived in 1769. Spanish missionaries under Father [[Junípero Serra]] founded [[Mission San Luis Rey de Francia]] on a former site of a [[Luiseño people|Luiseño]] Indian village on the banks of the [[San Luis Rey River]] called Keish according to the [[Portolà expedition]] who visited in the 1769.

In the early 19th century, the introduction of farming and grazing changed the landscape of what would become Oceanside.

===Mexican era===
[[File:The Luiseños Refusing to Work Under Captain Pablo de la Portillà.jpg|thumb|left|[[Luiseño]]s refusing to work for Captain [[Pablo de la Portillà]] in 1835]]
Following the [[Mexican secularization act of 1833]], the [[Spanish missions in California|Californian missions]] were nationalized, transferring their ownership from the [[Franciscan Order]] of the Catholic Church to the Mexican Government. A mission administrator was appointed to each mission to oversee the process of secularization, the removal of the priests, and the selling or granting of the mission lands to private citizens.

At Mission San Luis Rey, Padre Antonio Peyrí had presided over the mission for 34 years when soldiers forced his removal in late 1833. Captain [[Pablo de la Portillà]] was appointed as administrator of San Luis Rey. Following the departure of Padre Peyrí, relations between the [[Luiseño]]s and the new civilian administration hugely deteriorated, resulting in their famed refusal to work for Captain Portillà in 1835.

===American era===

In the late 1850s, Andrew Jackson Myers, an emigrant from Illinois, lived in [[San Joaquin County, California|San Joaquin County]], but he returned in the late 1880s and lived in [[San Luis Rey]]. In 1882 Myers moved on the land that was the original townsite for Oceanside. A patent for the land was issued in 1883 by the federal government.<ref name="plaque">{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Oceanside_plaque.jpg|title=Image:Oceanside plaque|date=July 17, 2006 |access-date=July 17, 2006}}</ref> It was incorporated on July 3, 1888. The city hall as of the early 21st century stands on the former Myers homestead.<ref name="plaque"/>

The town post office contains an oil-on-canvas mural, ''Air Mail'', painted in 1937 by Elsie Seeds. Federally commissioned murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the [[United States]] through the [[Section of Painting and Sculpture]], later called the [[Section of Fine Arts]], of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Arnesen |first=Eric |date=2007 |title=Encyclopedia of U.S. Labor and Working-Class History |volume=1 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |page=1540 |isbn=9780415968263}}</ref>

Oceanside continues to be known as a vacation home market.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fletcher|first=June|title=The Hottest Vacation-Home Markets: Second homes are sizzling; We tell you where—and why|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=June 13, 2005|page=R1}}</ref>

In the 2010s, several mid-rise and high-rise housing and lodging projects were completed in the downtown area, with more to come. In 2021, two large [[Hyatt]] resorts were completed, bringing more tourists to the city.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Tan|first=Michael|date=March 5, 2019|title=San Diego's Oceanside to open two upscale resorts operated by Hyatt|url=https://www.hotelmanagement.net/development/san-diego-s-oceanside-to-open-two-upscale-resorts-operated-by-hyatt|access-date=June 22, 2021|website=Hotel Management|language=en}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Oceanside Pier Aerial.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of Oceanside and the [[Oceanside Pier]]]]

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|42.2|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|41.2|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.9|sqmi|km2}}, comprising 2.23%, is water.

Traveling north on [[Interstate 5 (California)|Interstate 5]], Oceanside is the last city before [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]. As the crow flies, it is roughly the same distance from [[Aliso Viejo, California|Aliso Viejo]] as it is to [[downtown San Diego]].

Together with [[Carlsbad, California|Carlsbad]] and [[Vista, California|Vista]], it forms a [[Tri-City (disambiguation)|tri-city]] area.

===Climate===
Oceanside experiences a mild [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''BSk'') that is significantly tempered by maritime winds and the cool currents off the shoreline. The average high temperatures range from {{convert|64|to|77|F|C}}, while the average low temperatures range from {{convert|45|to|64|F|C}}.
