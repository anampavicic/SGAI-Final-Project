{{nihongo|'''Nara'''|奈良市|Nara-shi|extra={{IPA|ja|naꜜɾa||TomJ-Nara.ogg}}}} is the capital city of [[Nara Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. {{As of|2022}}, Nara has an estimated population of 367,353 according to World Population Review, making it the largest city in Nara Prefecture and sixth-largest in the [[Kansai region]] of [[Honshu]]. Nara is a [[Core cities of Japan|core city]] located in the northern part of Nara Prefecture bordering the [[Kyoto Prefecture]].

Nara was the capital of Japan during the [[Nara period]] from 710 to 794 as the seat of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] before the capital was moved to [[Kyoto]]. Nara is home to eight temples, shrines, and ruins, specifically [[Tōdai-ji]], [[Saidai-ji]], [[Kōfuku-ji]], [[Kasuga-taisha|Kasuga Shrine]], [[Gangō-ji]], [[Yakushi-ji]], [[Tōshōdai-ji]], and the [[Heijō Palace]], together with [[Kasugayama Primeval Forest]], collectively form the [[Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara]], a [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

==Etymology==
By the [[Heian period]], a variety of different characters had been used to represent the name Nara: {{lang|ja|乃楽}}, {{lang|ja|乃羅}}, {{lang|ja|平}}, {{lang|ja|平城}}, {{lang|ja|名良}}, {{lang|ja|奈良}}, {{lang|ja|奈羅}}, {{lang|ja|常}}, {{lang|ja|那良}}, {{lang|ja|那楽}}, {{lang|ja|那羅}}, {{lang|ja|楢}}, {{lang|ja|諾良}}, {{lang|ja|諾楽}}, {{lang|ja|寧}}, {{lang|ja|寧楽}} and {{lang|ja|儺羅}}.

A number of theories for the origin of the name "Nara" have been proposed, and some of the better-known ones are listed here. The second theory in the list, from the notable folklorist [[Kunio Yanagita]] (1875–1962), is most widely accepted at present.

*The {{lang|ja-latn|[[Nihon Shoki]]}} (''The Chronicles of Japan'', the second oldest book of classical Japanese history) suggests that "Nara" was derived from ''[[wiktionary:平す|narasu]]'' (to flatten, to level). According to this account, in September in the tenth year of [[Emperor Sujin]], "leading selected soldiers (the rebels) went forward, climbed Nara-yama (hills lying to the north of [[Heijō-kyō]]) and put them in order. Now the imperial forces gathered and flattened trees and plants. Therefore the mountain is called Nara-yama." Though the narrative itself is regarded as a folk etymology and few researchers regard it as historical, this is the oldest surviving suggestion, and is linguistically similar to the following theory by Yanagita.
*"Flat land" theory (currently most widely accepted): In his 1936 study of placenames,<ref>[http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/1879894/118 柳田国男 (Yanagita, Kunio) (1936): 地名の研究 ''(The Study of Place Names)''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117131331/http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/1879894/118 |date=2018-01-17 }}, pub. 古今書院 (Kokon Shoin), pp. 217–219</ref> the author [[Kunio Yanagita]] states that "the topographical feature of an area of relatively gentle gradient on the side of a mountain, which is called ''taira'' in eastern Japan and ''hae'' in the south of [[Kyushu]], is called ''naru'' in the [[Chūgoku region]] and [[Shikoku]] (central Japan). This word gives rise to the verb ''narasu'', adverb ''narashi'', and adjective ''narushi''." This is supported by entries in a dialect dictionary<ref>東条 操 (Tōjō, Misao) (1951): 全国方言辞典 ''Dictionary of Japanese Dialects'', 東京堂出版.</ref> for nouns referring to flat areas: ''naru'' (found in [[Aida District]], Okayama Prefecture and [[Ketaka District]], Tottori Prefecture) and ''naro'' (found in [[Kōchi Prefecture]]); and also by an adjective ''narui'' which is not standard Japanese, but is found all across central Japan, with meanings of "gentle", "gently sloping", or "easy". Yanagita further comments that the way in which the fact that so many of these placenames are written using the character {{lang|ja|平}} ("flat"), or other characters in which it is an element, demonstrates the validity of this theory. Citing a 1795 document, {{Nihongo||因幡志|Inaba-shi}} from the province of Inaba, the eastern part of modern [[Tottori Prefecture|Tottori]], as indicating the reading ''naruji'' for the word 平地 (standard reading ''heichi'', meaning "level/flat ground/land/country, a plain"), Yanagita suggests that ''naruji'' would have been used as a common noun there until the modern period. Of course, the fact that historically "Nara" was also written {{lang|ja|平}} or {{lang|ja|平城}} as above is further support for this theory.
*The idea that Nara is derived from {{lang|ja|楢}} ''nara'' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]] for "oak, deciduous ''[[Quercus]]'' spp.") is the next most common opinion. This idea was suggested by a linguist, Yoshida Togo.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/2937057/103 |title=吉田東伍 YOSHIDA Tōgo (1907), 『大日本地名辞書 上巻』 (The Dictionary of Place Names in the Great Japan, Fuzambo, Vol.1), 冨山房, pp.190–191. |access-date=2014-02-10 |archive-date=2014-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221163533/http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/2937057/103 |url-status=live }}</ref> This noun for the plant can be seen as early as in [[Man'yōshū]] (7–8th century) and [[Fudoki|Harima-no-kuni Fudoki]] (715). The latter book states the place name ''Narahara'' in [[Harima Province|Harima]] (around present-day [[Kasai, Hyōgo|Kasai]]) derives from this ''nara'' tree, which might support Yoshida's theory. Note that the name of the nearby city of [[Kashihara, Nara|Kashihara]] (literally "live oak plain") contains a semantically similar morpheme (Japanese {{lang|ja|橿}} ''kashi'' "live oak, evergreen ''[[Quercus]]'' spp.").
*Nara could be a [[loanword]] from [[Old Korean]], related to Middle Korean ''narah'' and Modern [[Korean language|Korean]] ''nara'' ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:나라|나라]]}}: "country", "nation", "kingdom"). This idea was put forward by the linguist [[Shizuo Matsuoka|Matsuoka Shizuo]].<ref>[http://kindai.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/1145583/492 松岡静雄 編 MATSUOKA Shizuo ed. (1929), 『日本古語大辞典』 ''(The Unabridged Dictionary of Old Japanese)'', 刀江書院, p.955.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221162250/http://kindai.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/1145583/492 |date=2014-02-21 }} Previous to Matsuoka, KANAZAWA Shôzaburô (1903) pointed out the possibility of influence from Korea. Both were, however, comparing [[Old Japanese]] to Modern Korean, not [[Old Korean]].</ref> American linguist [[Samuel E. Martin]] notes that the earliest attestation of this word in Korean sources—given in an eighth-century ''[[hyangga]]'' text, in the [[Phonogram (linguistics)|phonogram]]ic form {{lang|ja|[[wiktionary:國惡|國惡]]}}—should be read as ''NAL[A-]ak''. This is similar to the form implied by the Old Japanese writings of Nara that transcribe the second syllable with [[wiktionary:楽|楽]] (''raku''), and Martin notes that the city name has been "long suspected of being a borrowing from the Korean word".<ref>{{cite book |last=Martin |first=Samuel E. |title=Patterns of Change - Change of Patterns |editor-first1=Philip |editor-last1=Baldi |author-link=Samuel E.

(1981), 『古代地名語源辞典』 ''(The Dictionary of Ancient Place Name Etymology)'', 東京堂出版, p.232</ref>
*There is the idea that Nara is akin to [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] ''na''.<ref>One of the earliest assumption for this is seen in 奈良市 編 Nara ed. (1937), 『奈良市史』 ''(The History of Nara, Nara)''., 奈良市.</ref> In some Tungusic languages such as [[Orok language|Orok]] (and likely [[Goguryeo language]]), ''na'' means earth, land or the like. Some have speculated about a connection between these Tungusic words and Old Japanese ''nawi'', an archaic and somewhat obscure word that appears in the verb phrases ''nawi furu'' and ''nawi yoru'' ('an [[earthquake]] occurs, to have an earthquake').<ref>宮腰賢ほか編 MIYAKOSHI Masaru et al. ed. (2011), 『全訳古語辞典』 ''(The Dictionary of Old Japanese with Complete Translation)'' 第4版, 旺文社.</ref>

The "flat land" theory is adopted by [[Nihon Kokugo Daijiten]] (the largest dictionary of Japanese language), various dictionaries for place names,<ref name="kusuhara" /><ref>池田末則・横田健一編 IKEDA Suenori & YOKOTA Ken'ichi (Eds.)

===Modern Nara===
Although Nara was the capital of Japan from 710 to 794, it was not designated a city until 1 February 1898. Nara has since developed from a town of commerce in the Edo and Meiji periods to a modern tourist city, due to its large number of historical temples, landmarks and national monuments.

Nara city, as well as several important settlements (such as [[Kashihara, Nara|Kashihara]], [[Yamatokōriyama]], [[Tenri, Nara|Tenri]], [[Yamatotakada]], [[Sakurai, Nara|Sakurai]] and [[Gose, Nara|Gose]]{{sfnm|1a1=World Encyclopedia|1y=1988}}), are located in the [[Nara Basin]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kikuchi|1y=1994}} This makes it the most densely-populated region of Nara Prefecture.{{sfnm|1a1=Kikuchi|1y=1994}}

The downtown of Nara is on the east side of the ancient [[Heijō Palace]] site, occupying the northern part of what was called the {{Nihongo3||外京|Gekyō}}, literally the outer capital area. Many of the public offices (e.g. the Municipal office, the Nara Prefectural government, the Nara Police headquarters, etc.) are located on {{Nihongo3||二条大路|Nijō-ōji}}, while Nara branch offices of major nationwide banks are on {{Nihongo3||三条大路|Sanjō-ōji}}, with both avenues running east–west.

The highest point in the city is at the peak of Kaigahira-yama at an altitude of {{cvt|822.0|m|2}} (Tsugehayama-cho district), and the lowest is in Ikeda-cho district, with an altitude of {{cvt|56.4|m|2}}.<ref name="narajpn">{{cite web |url=http://www.city.nara.nara.jp/icity/browser?ActionCode=content&ContentID=1146477996507&SiteID=0000000000000&ParentGenre=1146554098431 |script-title=ja:奈良市統計書「統計なら」平成１７年版（２００５年版）(Nara City Statistics, Year 2005 Edition) |access-date=2007-04-02 |language=ja |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926222704/http://www.city.nara.nara.jp/icity/browser?ActionCode=content&ContentID=1146477996507&SiteID=0000000000000&ParentGenre=1146554098431 |archive-date=2007-09-26}}</ref>

===Climate===
The climate of Nara Prefecture is generally temperate, although there are notable differences between the north-western basin area and the rest of the prefecture which is more mountainous.

The basin area climate has an inland characteristic, as represented in the higher daily temperature variance, and the difference between summer and winter temperatures. Winter temperatures average approximately {{cvt|3|to|5|°C|F|0}}, and from {{cvt|25|to|28|C|F|0}} in the summer with highest readings reaching close to {{cvt|35|°C|0}}. There has not been a single year since 1990 with more than 10 days of snowfall recorded by Nara Local Meteorological Observatory.

The climate in the rest of the prefecture is that of higher elevations especially in the south, with {{cvt|-5|°C|0}} being the extreme minimum in winter. Heavy rainfall is often observed in summer. The annual accumulated rainfall totals as much as {{cvt|3000|to|5000|mm|2|lk=out}}, which is among the heaviest in Japan and indeed in the world outside the equatorial zone.

Spring and fall temperatures are temperate and comfortable. The mountainous region of Yoshino has been long popular for viewing cherry blossoms in the spring. In autumn, the southern mountains are also a popular destination for viewing fall foliage.

A 2009 study by Harumi Torii (who is the assistant professor of wildlife management at Nara University of Education,) in which necropsies of deceased shika deer in Nara park were conducted, found that the deer in Nara park were malnourished from not having enough grass to eat, and eating too many rice crackers and other human food. The rice crackers commonly fed to the deer lack fiber and other nutrients deer require, so when the deer eat too many rice crackers it causes the gut microbiome in the deer to become unbalanced, among other problems.
7 out of 8 deer dissected had a “kidney fat index” (which measures how much fat has attached to the kidneys) below 40%, which indicates malnutrition in the deer. And of those 7, some had kidney fat below 10%, which indicates starvation. Compared to male shika deer outside of Nara park, which weigh about 50 kilograms on average, the male shika deer in Nara park only weigh 30 kilograms on average. The color of the femoral marrow in Nara park’s deer was also abnormal, indicating malnourishment.
When living deer in Nara park were observed during the study, it was discovered that rice crackers made up about one third of the average deer’s diet in Nara park, with grass making up about two thirds. The deer have become so excessively numerous in Nara park, that there isn’t enough grass in the park for all of them to live entirely on grass, creating a dependency on humans for rice crackers. This lack of grass also causes the deer to resort to eating garbage and plants that they would not normally eat.<ref>[https://nara-edu.repo.nii.ac.jp/?action=repository_action_common_download&item_id=12203&item_no=1&attribute_id=17&file_no=1 Thesis] nii.ac.jp</ref>
The deer in Nara park have become overpopulated due to being fed by people frequently, and having few predators. And the deer have caused extensive damage to trees (by feeding on bark,) bamboo (by eating their shoots,) and other plants in the park. 
Additionally, the deer have become aggressive towards humans in their solicitation of food (which leads to people getting injured by deer,) aggressive towards each other in competition for rice crackers, and have lost their fear of predators in general.
For these reasons, tourists may want to consider not feeding the deer in Nara park, and simply observe them instead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.kogenta.ciao.jp/?eid=592501|title=奈良公園のシカは栄養不足、観光客のせんべい頼り}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://news.yahoo.co.jp/byline/tanakaatsuo/20180704-00088123 | title=奈良の鹿は栄養失調？ 鹿せんべい食えたらイイわけじゃない（田中淳夫） - エキスパート }}</ref>
