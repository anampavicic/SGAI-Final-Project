==Etymology==
Nagercoil derives from the Tamil expression ''Nagaraja koyil'', meaning "temple of Nagas".<ref>{{Cite web |title=About Nagercoil Corporation |url=https://nagercoilcorporation.in/about-nagercoil-corporation/ |access-date=2024-04-29 |website=Nagercoil Corporation |language=en-US}}</ref>

== History ==
"Kottara: This is the name of a place in the country of the 'Aii', or ' Paralia ' (identical with South Travancore), which is called ‘Kottiara Metropolis' by Ptolemy, ' Cottora' by Pliny. Undoubtedly the town referred to is ‘Kôțţâra' or, as it is ordinarily spelled by Europeans, ‘ Kotaur,' the principal town in South Travancore, and now , as in the time of the Greeks, distinguished for its commerce. The name of the place is derived from ‘ Kôd-u, ' Tam., a line of circumvallation, a fortification , and “ ârú, ' a river. It is a rule in the Tamil and the Malayalam , that when a word like ‘Kôd is the first member of a compound, the final ' ' must be doubled for the purpose of giving the word the force of an adjective : it is another rule that sonants when doubled become surds. Consequently the compound ‘kôd- ara' becomes by rule 'kôţt-âra' . It is interesting to perceive that in the time of the Greeks the same peculiar phonetic rules existed which are now in operation . It is also worth noticing that the Greek writers represent the last syllable of the name of the town, not as ' âru ,' but as 'âra . The Tamil has ' âru, ' the Malayalam 'ara ' At Kotaur, the dialectic peculiarities of the Malayalam language begin to supersede those of the Tamil ; and this appears to have been the case even in the time of the
Greeks." (Page 62-63)<ref>{{Cite book |last=Caldwell |first=Robert |url=https://archive.org/details/dli.CiXIV42 |title=A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian Or South-Indian Family of Languages |publisher=Harrison and sons |year=1856 |pages=7, 62–63 |language=en}}</ref> It was from the ancient trade centre of [[Kottar]] from where the city of Nagercoil began to expand.

Known as the '''Granary of [[Travancore]]''', Nagercoil not only served as the food basket of Kerala, but was also one among the important spice-trading centers in the kingdom of [[Travancore]] from the 14th century onward, and maintained a trade network with Arab merchants from the pre-Islamic era. Various Tamil and Kerala kings fought over this rich agricultural land, which boasted six rivers. Various historians cite that the land's climate and diverse, luxuriant vegetation had no comparison anywhere else in Tamil Nadu.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhrRboi5kOcC&q=granary+of+travancore&pg=PA61|title=River Disputes in India: Kerala Rivers Under Siege|first=S.

[[File:Suchindram - Thanumalayan Temple5.jpg|thumb|right|The Thanumalayan Temple Pond and its adjoining streets inhabited since the 16th century.]]
The architecture of Nagercoil consists of an eclectic combination of architectural styles, ranging from those that predate the creation of the town, from the early [[Dravidian architecture]] and [[Kerala Architecture]], to English [[Gothic Revival]], to the 21st century contemporary. Although there are prehistoric and classical structures in the city, the architectural history of Nagercoil effectively begins with the first small settlements from 3 A.D. The Roman naturalist and writer [[Pliny the Elder]] mentions Nagercoil as a commercial metropolis, having trade links with his contemporaneous Roman merchants, who traded and stayed in unique rock-walled, clay-roofed structures. This legacy can be found in some of the town's old heritage structures like the [[Nagaraja Temple, Nagercoil]]. The temple has two main deities, Krishna (revered as Ananda Krishna) and Nagaraja. The upadevathas are Shiva, Subrahmanya Swami, Ganesha, Devi, and Dwarapalaka. As an ancient tradition, the priests are Namboothiri Brahmins who are referred by the Pambumekkat mana in Thrissur, Kerala. Later on, Dravidian and Kerala architectural styles began to appear in the area. This can be attributed to the construction of the [[Thanumalayan Temple]] in the 16th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/br/2002/01/29/stories/2002012900150300.htm|title=History of Suchindram temples|website=The Hindu}}</ref>

The 14th century [[St. Francis Xavier's Cathedral, Kottar]] serves as a testimony to the mix of Roman and native architecture. While Saint Xavier was doing missionary work at Kottar and its neighborhood, he averted an invasion of Padagas and thus protected the people of the Venad kingdom from that attack which was appreciated by the king, Unni Kerala Varma. In recognition of Xavier's services, the king allotted him a piece of land to construct a Catholic church, as a gesture of goodwill, as per the church records. There was already a small church, in the same place where St. Xavier's church stands at present, dedicated to Mary the Mother of God, since AD 1544.

The brilliant artistic influence of Kerala and British architecture marvels are seen in the Nagercoil Palace, [[Nagercoil Clock Tower]], [[CSI Home Church, Nagercoil|Home Church]], [[Scott Christian College]], [[Scott Christian Higher Secondary School|Scott School]], [[Carmel Higher Secondary School]], [[St. Joseph's Convent Higher Secondary School|St. Joseph Convent]], Sethu Lakshmi Bai School, Nagercoil Court, The Concordia Seminary, Filter House, [[Catherine Booth Hospital|The Salvation Army Catherine Booth Hospital]] and many more heritage structures in and around the town. 

The Nagercoil Clock Tower is the most visible to the outside world, situated in the heart of the town, which was built to commemorate the visit of Sri Moolam Thirunal, the ruler of [[Travancore]], in 1893, and was designed by Hogeorf and S. Horesly of England. The Maharajah himself inaugurated it on 15 February of that year. The pendulum of the clock was made in Derbyshire by Smith of Derby Group, [[London]]. The clock is attached to a 60-foot-long chain with a weight, operated with pulleys through gravitational force. The clock in the Nagercoil Clock Tower was presented to the Maharajah by Rev. James Duthie. of the London Missionary Society.<ref name="OnlineKanyakumari.Com">{{cite web|title=Nagercoil Clock Tower - Nagercoil Mani Medai  |url=http://www.onlinekanyakumari.com/nagercoil-clock-tower-tower-junction-mani-medai-manimedai/|publisher=OnlineKanyakumari.Com|access-date=16 July 2016}}</ref> The total cost for constructing the Nagercoil Clock Tower was ₹ 3,258, 9 Chakrams and 12 Kasu.
