'''Normandy''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɔr|m|ə|n|d|i}} {{respell|NOR|mən|dee}}; {{langx|fr|Normandie|link=no}} {{IPA|fr|nɔʁmɑ̃di||Fr-Normandie.ogg}}; {{langx|nrf|Normaundie}}) is the northwesternmost of the eighteen [[regions of France]], roughly coextensive with the historical [[Duchy of Normandy]].

Normandy is divided into five administrative [[Departments of France|departments]]: [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]], [[Eure]], [[Manche]], [[Orne]] and [[Seine-Maritime]]. It covers {{convert|30627|km2}},<ref>[http://195.7.104.1/normandy/gb/01bienv/index.html Administrative Normandy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501135826/http://195.7.104.1/normandy/gb/01bienv/index.html|date=1 May 2008}}</ref> comprising roughly 5% of the territory of [[metropolitan France]]. Its population of 3,322,757 accounts for around 5% of the population of France. The inhabitants of Normandy are known as [[Normans]], and the region is the historic homeland of the [[Norman language]]. The neighboring regions are [[Hauts-de-France]] and [[Île-de-France|Ile-de-France]] to the east, [[Centre-Val de Loire]] to the southeast, [[Pays de la Loire]] to the south, and [[Brittany]] to the southwest. Its [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] and largest city is [[Rouen]], although the [[Regional council (France)|regional council]] sits in [[Caen]], making Normandy one of two regions in France (along with [[Bourgogne-Franche-Comté]]) in which the [[Prefect (France)|prefect]] does not sit in the same city as the regional council.

Normandy's name comes from the settlement of the territory by [[Viking]]s ("[[Norsemen|Northmen]]") from the 9th century, and confirmed by treaty in the 10th century between King [[Charles the Simple|Charles III of France]] and the Viking ''[[Earl|jarl]]'' [[Rollo]].

== History ==
{{See also|Normandy#History}}[[File:HalftimberedHousesRouen2.JPG|thumb|left|Half-timbered houses in Rouen]]

Rollo's descendant [[William the Conqueror|William]] became king of England in 1066 after defeating [[Harold Godwinson]], the last of the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon kings]], at the [[Battle of Hastings]], while retaining the [[fiefdom]] of Normandy for himself and his descendants.

In 1204, during the reign of [[John, King of England|John of England]], mainland Normandy was taken from the [[Angevin Empire]] by France under King [[Philip II of France|Philip II]]. Insular Normandy (the Channel Islands) remained, however, under English control. In 1259, [[Henry III of England]] recognized the legality of French possession of mainland Normandy under the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]].

In 1790 the five departments of Normandy replaced the former province.

Between 1956 and 2015 Normandy was divided into two [[Regions of France|administrative regions]]: [[Lower Normandy]] and [[Upper Normandy]]; the regions were merged into one single region on 1 January 2016.<ref name="reform law">{{cite French law|number or usual name=n° 2015–29|date in French=16 janvier 2015|full name=relative à la délimitation des régions, aux élections régionales et départementales et modifiant le calendrier électoral|language=French|lower case=|URL=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=9FECBA9D9314D1D2C093CF793C886ED5.tpdila21v_1?idSectionTA=JORFSCTA000030109623&cidTexte=JORFTEXT000030109622&dateTexte=29990101}}</ref> [[Upper Normandy]] (''Haute-Normandie'') consisted of the French ''[[Département in France|departments]]'' of [[Seine-Maritime]] and [[Eure]], and [[Lower Normandy]] (''Basse-Normandie'') of the ''[[Département in France|departments]]'' of [[Orne]], [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]], and [[Manche]].

The modern region of Normandy was created by the territorial reform of French Regions in 2014 by the merger of [[Lower Normandy]], and [[Upper Normandy]]. The new region took effect on 1 January 2016, after the [[2015 French regional elections|regional elections in December 2015]].<ref>{{cite news|date=17 December 2014|title=La carte à 13 régions définitivement adoptée|language=fr|newspaper=[[Le Monde]]|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2014/12/17/la-carte-a-13-regions-definitivement-adoptee_4542278_823448.html|access-date=13 January 2015}}</ref>

The [[Regional Council of Normandy]], created on 1 January 2016, has 102 members who are elected under a system of [[proportional representation]]. The executive consists of a president and vice-presidents. [[Hervé Morin]] from the Centre party was elected president of the council in January 2016. The council is based in [[Caen]], making Normandy one of only two regions (the other being [[Bourgogne-Franche-Comté]]) where the prefecture and seat of local government are located in different cities.
