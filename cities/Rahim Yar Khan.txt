==History==
It has been renamed several times over the last 5,000 years. The earliest recorded name was AROR or ALOR, and then it became City of Pattan, Phul Wada, Noshehra and now Rahim Yar Khan. The ancient tower of Pattan Minarah stands 13&nbsp;km to the south of the city center in its original form. Umayyads led by Muhammad Bin Qasim conquered the cities of [[Aror]], [[Uch]] and [[Multan]] after conquest of Sindh.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Firishtah |first=Muḥammad Qāsim Hindū Shāh Astarābādī |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q44BAAAAMAAJ&q=indian+history+by+firishta |title=The History of Hindostan |date=1770 |publisher=T. Becket and P.A. De Hondt}}</ref>

Rahim Yar Khan region was part of [[Multan Subah|Multan province]] of Mughal Empire.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Dasti |first=Humaira Faiz |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kH3jAAAAMAAJ&q=multan+a+province+of+mughal |title=Multan, a Province of the Mughal Empire, 1525–1751 |date=1998 |publisher=Royal Book |isbn=978-969-407-226-5}}</ref> In 1881, [[Nawab of Bahawalpur]] gave the city its current name by naming it after his first born son and crown prince Rahim Yar Khan.

Rahim Yar Khan has had the status of a separate district since 1943. The district derives its name from its headquarters, the city of Rahim Yar Khan, which was known as "Naushehra" until 1881. To avoid confusion with the similarly named city of [[Nowshera, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Nowshera]], the ruler of [[Bahawalpur]], Nawab Sadiq Khan IV, renamed it after his first son, Rahim Yar Khan (1877–1881).<ref>{{Cite web |website=District Courts Rahim Yar Khan website |url=https://rahimyarkhan.dc.lhc.gov.pk/PublicPages/HistoryOfDistrict.aspx |access-date=2023-05-16 |title=Brief History of Rahim Yar Khan}}</ref>

==Demographics==
The population of the city is 517,000 during the [[2023 Pakistani census|2023 census]].<ref name="macrotrends_population"/>
