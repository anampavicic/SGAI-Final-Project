The territory of Kursk Oblast has been populated since the end of the [[Last Glacial Period|last ice age]]. Slavic tribes of the [[Severians]] inhabited the area. From 830 the current Kursk Oblast was part of the [[Rus' Khaganate]] and [[Kievan Rus']] states. The oldest towns in the region are [[Kursk]] and [[Rylsk, Russia|Rylsk]], first mentioned in 1032 and 1152,<ref name=sgk>{{cite book|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Słownik geograficzny Królestwa Polskiego i innych krajów słowiańskich, Tom X|year=1889|language=pl|location=Warszawa|page=94}}</ref> respectively, both capitals of small medieval eponymous duchies.<ref name=army>{{cite web|url=https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/08/09/sim-czikavyh-faktiv-pro-kursk-i-kurshhynu/|title=Сім цікавих фактів про Курськ і Курщину|language=uk|access-date=19 August 2024|archive-date=August 18, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240818221530/https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/08/09/sim-czikavyh-faktiv-pro-kursk-i-kurshhynu/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=sgk/> In the 13th century, the region was conquered by the [[Mongol Empire]].

In the 15th century it was part of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] under the [[Jagiellonian]] dynasty. It was lost in the 16th-century [[Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars]] to the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Grand Duchy of Moscow]]. A real growth of the area around Kursk began soon after that, with a large migration from Central Russia after the [[Russian famine of 1601–1603]]. The region was affected by [[Crimean–Nogai slave raids in Eastern Europe|Crimean–Nogai slave raids]] in the 16th and 17th centuries. The current southwestern outskirts of the oblast with the town of [[Sudzha]] were part of [[Sloboda Ukraine]] and populated by Ukrainians since the mid-17th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://leksika.com.ua/15210920/legal/sumskiy_polk|title=Сумський полк|language=uk|access-date=15 August 2024}}</ref> Between 1708 and 1719, Kursk was part of the newly created [[Kiev Governorate]]. From 1719 to 1727, it was a part of [[Belgorodsky Uyezd]] of Kiev Governorate. From 1727, [[Kursky Uyezd]] was part of [[Belgorod Governorate]].<ref>{{cite Efron|Курск}}</ref> On 23 May 1779, [[Kursk Governorate]] was established.

During [[World War I]], in 1918, it was the site of fights of Ukrainians and [[Imperial German Army|Germans]] against Russia. In 1918, the western portion of the current Kursk Oblast with the towns of Rylsk and Sudzha was part of the [[Ukrainian State]].<ref name=army/> [[Korenevo, Korenevsky District, Kursk Oblast|Korenevo]] was the place of signing of a [[ceasefire]] between the Ukrainian State, [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Soviet Russia]] in May 1918.

The Kursk Governorate existed until 1928, when the territory of Kursk Governorate became a part of [[Central Black Earth Oblast]]. As Central Chernozem Oblast was very large its administration was very difficult, on 13 June 1934 it was divided into two oblasts: Kursk Oblast and Voronezh Oblast.{{cn|date=August 2024}} In the period between 1934 and 1954, oblasts' borders were frequently adjusted. However, the area and borders of the oblast have remained stable from 1954.

During [[World War II]], the territory of Kursk Oblast was occupied by [[Nazi Germany|German]] troops from the autumn of 1941 until the summer of 1943. The [[Battle of Kursk]], which was one of the major battles of World War II, took place in the region between 5 July 1943 and 23 August 1943.

The territory of Kursk Oblast was the region in which the 4th [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union|leader of the Soviet Union]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]], was born.

As of 2024, the [[Urengoy–Pomary–Uzhhorod pipeline]] in [[Sudzha]] was the last remaining point through which [[Natural gas in Russia|natural gas]] flowed from Russia to Europe via Ukraine.<ref>{{cite news |title=Is it the end for Russian gas supplies to Europe via Ukraine? |url=https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/is-it-end-russian-gas-supplies-europe-via-ukraine-2024-08-12/ |work=Reuters |date=12 August 2024}}</ref>

The average elevation is {{convert|177|-|225|m|ft|abbr=on}} and the Timsko-Shchigrinsky ridge contains the highest point at {{convert|288|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. The low relief, gentle slopes, and mild winters make the area suitable for farming, and much of the forest has been cleared. [[Chernozem]] soils cover around 70% of the oblast, and [[podsol]] soils 26%; chernozem is among the best soils for agriculture, and podsol among the worst. 

Kursk Oblast contributes to two major drainage areas: the [[Dnieper River]] and the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]] (78% and 22% respectively).  There are 902&nbsp;rivers and streams in the oblast, with a total length of approximately {{convert|8000|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Major rivers include the [[Seym River|Seym]] and the [[Psyol River|Psyol]].

[[File:Bolshoye Gorodkovo, Kurskaya oblast' Russia, 307624 - panoramio - Leonid Andronov (4).jpg|thumb|Kursk Oblast landscape]]
Kursk Oblast is one of Russia's major producers of [[iron ore]]. The area of the [[Kursk Magnetic Anomaly]] has one of the richest iron-ore deposits in the world. [[Rare earths]] and [[base metal]]s also occur in commercial quantities in several locations. Refractory [[loam]], [[heavy mineral sands ore deposits|mineral sands]], and [[chalk]] are quarried and processed in the region. The oblast's reserves of [[artesian aquifer|artesian-well water]] are proving useful for medical purposes.

[[File:Streleckaja step.JPG|thumb|A [[Cumans|Cuman]] statue in the [[East European forest steppe]] in the oblast]]

===Climate===

===Education===
[[File:Курская Коренная пустынь.JPG|thumb|An Orthodox monastery where ''[[Our Lady of Kursk]]'' used to be located]]

The largest universities of Kursk Oblast are [[Kursk State University]], [[Kursk State Technical University]], [[Kursk State Medical University]] and Kursk State Agricultural Academy, all of which are located in the city of Kursk. There are also 19&nbsp;other higher education facilities in Kursk Oblast.

==Politics==
[[File:Курская областная дума.jpg|thumb|Kursk Oblast Duma seat, June 2012]]

During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Kursk CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). In 1991, CPSU lost power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

The Charter of Kursk Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The [[Kursk Oblast Duma]] is the province's standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].

The center-right pro-government [[United Russia]] Party and the left [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] are Kursk Oblast's major political parties. Traditionally, the Communist Party is the strongest in the Oblast's rural area.

==Economy==
[[File:Kurchatov, Kursk Oblast, Russia - panoramio (21).jpg|thumb|Shops in [[Kurchatov, Russia|Kurchatov]] in 2013]]

===Industry===
The oblast's industrial production dropped rapidly during the 1990s, as an industrial crisis was stimulated by the nationwide economic crisis which followed the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]. However, by the end of the decade output was increasing. Moreover, the manufacturing sector, despite a sagging economy in the late 20th century, continues to account for about 40% of the oblast's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. The engineering, electric-power, metal-working, chemicals, and food processing are the dominant industries.

The Mikhailovsky Mining Plant is one of the largest [[iron ore]] mining and processing facilities in Russia.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ukrainian drones strike Russian iron ore plant |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-drone-strikes-fuel-warehouse-russias-kursk-region-governor-says-2024-03-06/ |work=Reuters |date=6 March 2024}}</ref>

The [[Kursk Nuclear Power Plant]] is one of the three biggest nuclear power plants in Russia and one of the four biggest [[Electricity sector in Russia|electricity producers]] in the country.

===Agriculture===
Most of the main farming areas are used for natural pastures or cultivation, which involves mainly [[wheat]], [[sugar beet]], and [[fodder]] crops.
