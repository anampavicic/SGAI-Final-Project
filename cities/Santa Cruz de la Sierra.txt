'''Santa Cruz de la Sierra''' ({{IPA|es|ˈsanta ˈkɾus ðe la ˈsjera|lang}}; {{lit|Holy Cross of the Mountain Range}}), commonly known as '''Santa Cruz''', is the largest city in [[Bolivia]] and the capital of the [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz department]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url=http://www.ine.gob.bo/indice/visualizador.aspx?ah=PC20103.HTM |title=National Statistics Institute.

Situated on the [[Pirai River (Bolivia)|Pirai River]] in the eastern Tropical Lowlands of Bolivia, the Santa Cruz de la Sierra Metropolitan Region is the most populous urban agglomeration in Bolivia with an estimated population of 2.4 million<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bolivia: Proyecciones de Población según Departamento y Municipio, 2012-2020.|url=https://www.ine.gob.bo/index.php/censos-y-proyecciones-de-poblacion-sociales/|website=INE Bolivia|publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia.|language=es|url-status=live|archive-url=http://inecloud.ine.gob.bo/owncloud/index.php/s/HLnakP9fWjUlM4S/download|archive-date=2020-06-01|access-date=2020-06-01}}</ref> in 2020. It is formed out of a conurbation of seven Santa Cruz municipalities: Santa Cruz de la Sierra, [[La Guardia, Bolivia|La Guardia]], [[Warnes, Bolivia|Warnes]], [[Cotoca]], [[El Torno, Santa Cruz|El Torno]], [[Porongo]], and [[Montero, Bolivia|Montero]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ocho municipios de la región metropolitana de Santa Cruz se unen y demandan atención económica al Gobierno nacional {{!}} EL DEBER|url=https://eldeber.com.bo/189938_ocho-municipios-de-la-region-metropolitana-de-santa-cruz-se-unen-y-demandan-atencion-economica-al-go|access-date=2020-07-14|website=eldeber.com.bo|date=13 July 2020 |language=es}}</ref>

The city was first founded in 1561 by Spanish explorer [[Ñuflo de Chavez]] about {{convert|200|km|0|abbr=on}} east of its current location, and was moved several times until it was finally established on the [[Piray River|Pirai River]] in the late 16th century. For much of its history, Santa Cruz was mostly a small outpost town, and even after Bolivia gained its independence in 1825 there was little attention from the authorities or the population in general to settle the region. It was not until after the middle of the 20th century with profound agrarian and land reforms that the city began to grow at a very fast pace. Due to its low elevation at the foothills of the [[Andes]] and being situated in the [[Amazon basin]], the city has a [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra#Climate|tropical climate]] unlike the other main metro area of [[La Paz]] that is thousands of meters higher in terms of elevation.

Santa Cruz is Bolivia's most populous city, produces nearly 35% of Bolivia's [[GDP|gross domestic product]], and receives over 40% of all [[foreign direct investment]] in the country. The city is the most important business center in Bolivia and the country's principal destination for national and international migrants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cainco.org.bo/publicaciones/Estudios/04-Santa%20Cruz.pdf|title=The Contributions of Santa Cruz to Bolivia (Spanish only)|publisher=CAINCO|year=2008|access-date=2011-09-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524100242/http://www.cainco.org.bo/publicaciones/Estudios/04-Santa%20Cruz.pdf|archive-date=2011-05-24|url-status=live}}</ref>

== History ==

===Pre-Columbian era===
{{Unreferencedsect|date=September 2023}}
Like much of the history of the people of the region, the history of the area before the arrival of European explorers is not well documented, mostly because of the somewhat nomadic nature and the absence of a [[written language]] in the culture of the local tribes. However, recent data suggests that the current location of the city of Santa Cruz was inhabited by an [[Arawak]] tribe that later came to be known by the Spanish as [[Chané]]. Remains of ceramics and weapons have been found in the area, leading researchers to believe they had established settlements in the area. Among the few known facts of these tribes, according to accounts of the first Spanish explorers that came into contact with the Chané, are that they had a formal leader, a ''cacique'', called Grigotá for several years but his reign came to an end after one of the several [[Eastern Bolivian Guarani|Guarani]] (Chiriguano) incursions in the area.

===Early European incursions and founding of the city===
[[File:Mapa de América del Sur (Gobernaciones 1534-1539).svg|thumb|left|The {{lang|es|[[adelantado]]}} grants of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] before the establishment of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]].]]
The first Europeans to set foot in the area were Spanish [[conquistadores]]{{when|date=September 2023}} from the recently created [[Governorate of New Andalusia]] that encompassed the territories of present-day Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Chile.{{cn|date=September 2023}}

In 1549, Captain General [[Domingo Martinez de Irala]] became the first Spaniard to explore the region, but it was not until 1558 that [[Ñuflo de Chaves|Ñuflo de Chavez]], who had arrived in [[Asuncion|Asunción]] in 1541 with [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]], led a new expedition with the objective of settling the region.{{cn|date=September 2023}} After discovering that a new expedition from Asuncion was already underway, he quickly traveled to [[Lima]] and successfully persuaded the [[Viceroy]] to create a new province and grant him the title of governor on February 15, 1560.{{cn|date=September 2023}} Upon returning from Lima, Chavez founded the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra (Holy Cross of the Hills) on February 26, 1561, {{convert|220|km|0|abbr=on}} east of its present-day location, to function as the capital of the newly formed province of [[Moxos Province|Moxos]] and Chaves. The settlement was named after Chaves's [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Spain|home town]] in [[Extremadura]], where he grew up before venturing to America.{{cn|date=September 2023}}

Shortly after the founding, attacks from local tribes became commonplace and Ñuflo de Chaves was killed in 1568 by Itatine natives. After Chaves's death, the conflicts with the local population as well as power struggles in the settlement forced the authorities in Peru to order the new governor, Lorenzo Suarez de Figueroa to relocate the city to the west. Many of the inhabitants, however, chose to stay behind and continued living in the original location. On September 13, 1590, the city was officially moved to the banks of the Guapay Empero river and renamed San Lorenzo de la Frontera. Nevertheless, the conditions proved to be even more severe at the new location forcing the settlers to relocate once again on May 21, 1595. Although this was the final relocation of the city, the name San Lorenzo continued to be used until the early 17th century, when the settlers who remained behind in Santa Cruz de la Sierra were convinced by the colonial authorities to move to San Lorenzo. After they moved the city was finally consolidated in 1622 and took its original name of Santa Cruz de la Sierra given by Ñuflo de Chaves over 60 years before. Remnants of the original settlement can be visited in Santa Cruz la Vieja ("Old Santa Cruz"), an archaeological site south of San José de Chiquitos.<ref>{{cite book | author = Nino Gandarilla | title = Santa Cruz en los umbrales del desarrollo | publisher = Proyecciones RRPP | location = Santa Cruz de la Sierra | year = 1995 | url = http://www.geograficasantacruz.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Santa-Cruz-en-los-Umbrales-del-Desarrollo.pdf | page = 41 | access-date = 2011-09-12 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120402102227/http://www.geograficasantacruz.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Santa-Cruz-en-los-Umbrales-del-Desarrollo.pdf | archive-date = 2012-04-02 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elmundo.com.bo/Secundarianew.asp?edicion=26/02/2006&Tipo=Comunidad&Cod=4858 |title=Fundación de Santa Cruz de la Sierra: una historia épica del Siglo XV |work=El Mundo |date=29 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329011812/http://www.elmundo.com.bo/Secundarianew.asp?edicion=26%2F02%2F2006&Tipo=Comunidad&Cod=4858 |archive-date=2012-03-29 |url-status=dead}} </ref>

===Colonial Santa Cruz and revolutionary war===
[[File:Ignacio Warnes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ignacio Warnes]]]]
Over the next 200 years, several tribes were either incorporated under Spanish control or defeated by force.{{cn|date=September 2023}} The city also became an important staging point for [[Jesuit reductions|Jesuit missions]] to [[Chiquitos]] and Moxos, leading to the conversion of thousands of Guaranies, Moxeños, Chiquitanos, [[Guarayos]] and Chiriguanos that eventually became part of the racially mixed population of the modern Santa Cruz, [[Beni Department|Beni]], [[Pando Department|Pando]] and [[Tarija Department|Tarija]] departments of Bolivia. Another important role the small town played in the region for the [[Spanish Empire]] was to contain the incursions of Portuguese [[Bandeirantes]], many of which were repelled by the use of force over the years.{{cn|date=September 2023}}
The efforts for consolidating the borders of the Empire were not overlooked by the authorities in Lima, who granted the province a great degree of autonomy.{{cn|date=September 2023}} The province was ruled by a Captain General based in Santa Cruz, and, in turn, the city government was administered by two mayors and a council of four people. Citizens of Santa Cruz were exempt from all imperial taxes and the [[Mita (Inca)|mita]] system used in the rest of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] was not practiced. However, in spite of its strategic importance, the city did not grow much in colonial times. Most of the economic activity was centered in the mining centers of the west and the main source of income of the city was agriculture.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

Animosity towards imperial authorities began at the turn of the 18th century when the new system of [[Intendencia#Spanish monarchy|intendencias]] reached the new world. The seat of government was taken away from the city and moved to [[Cochabamba]], and many of the powers delegated by the viceroyalty were now in the hands of appointees of the crown.{{cn|date=September 2023}} Like in many parts of Spanish America at the time, angered by the reforms the criollos saw as a threat to their way of life, and taking advantage of the [[Peninsular War]], the local population, led by Antonio Vicente Seonane, revolted on September 24, 1810, overthrowing the governor delegate. A junta of local commanders took control of the government in his place. The revolutionaries, as it was the case with most of the revolts in [[Spanish America]], remained loyal to the [[King of Spain]], while repudiating the colonial authorities until after the end of the Peninsular War.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

By 1813 the city was once again under imperial control. At this time, by order of General [[Manuel Belgrano]], the revolutionary armies of Argentina sent a small force led by [[Ignacio Warnes]] to "liberate" Santa Cruz. After his successful campaign, he assumed control of the government of the city. In a little over a year Warnes was able to gather tremendous support from the population, enlisting criollos, mestizos and natives to the revolutionary army, and allying with the revolutionary leader of [[Vallegrande]], Alvarez de Arenales, to defeat a strong imperial force in the Battle of Florida. This victory proved to be a serious blow to Spanish forces in the region. Nevertheless, two years after the victory of Florida, imperial forces launched a new offensive in the province led by Francisco Javier Aguilera. This campaign ended with the defeat and death of Ignacio Warnes and his forces in the Battle of Pari. Triumphant, Aguilera marched into the city with orders to quell the insurrection and reinstate the Spanish governor. This proved to be a very difficult task, with several revolutionary leaders, such as Jose Manuel "Cañoto" Baca and Jose Manuel Mercado, rising up in the coming years from the city itself and elsewhere in the province. These new leaders fought colonial authorities for seven years until they finally deposed the last Spanish governor, Manuel Fernando Aramburu, in February 1825 after news of the defeat of the imperial armies in the west had reached the city.<ref>{{cite book | author = Nino Gandarilla | title = Santa Cruz en los umbrales del desarrollo | publisher = Proyecciones RRPP | location = Santa Cruz de la Sierra | year = 1995 | url = http://www.geograficasantacruz.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Santa-Cruz-en-los-Umbrales-del-Desarrollo.pdf | page = 46 | access-date = 2011-09-12 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120402102227/http://www.geograficasantacruz.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Santa-Cruz-en-los-Umbrales-del-Desarrollo.pdf | archive-date = 2012-04-02 | url-status = live }}</ref>

===Climate===
The city has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system|Köppen]]: ''Am''), with an average annual temperature around {{convert|25|°C|0}} and all months above of {{convert|18|°C|°F|1|disp=or}} . Santa Cruz is an example of the influence of continentality (reflecting the [[Atmospheric temperature#Temperature range|thermal amplitude]]) in the [[tropics]], without the four well-defined seasons of the year but greater deviations of temperature than other places in the coast or island.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=54258&cityname=Santa+Cruz,+Bolivia|title=Santa Cruz, Bolivia Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2019-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190225103004/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=54258&cityname=Santa+Cruz,+Bolivia|archive-date=2019-02-25|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Abrahamczyk|first1=Stefan|last2=Kluge|first2=Jürgen|last3=Gareca|first3=Yuvinka|last4=Reichle|first4=Steffen|last5=Kessler|first5=Michael|date=2011-11-02|title=The Influence of Climatic Seasonality on the Diversity of Different Tropical Pollinator Groups|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=6|issue=11|pages=e27115|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0027115|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3206942|pmid=22073268|bibcode=2011PLoSO...627115A|doi-access=free}}</ref> Although the weather is generally very warm all year round, cold winds called "surazos" can blow in occasionally (particularly in the winter) from the Argentine [[pampas]] making the temperature drop considerably.

==Demographics==
[[File:Santa Cruz de la Sierra de noche.png|thumb|Santa Cruz at night]]
The city of Santa Cruz is, besides being the largest city in [[Bolivia]], the one with the greatest mestizo and Creole identity, and with a smaller indigenous population. The first settlers of Santa Cruz were mainly the Native [[Chane people]] of East Bolivia followed by the Spaniards that accompanied Ñuflo de Chávez, as well as [[Guarani people|Guarani]] natives from [[Paraguay]], and other native American groups that previously lived there working for the Spanish crown. Eventually, the Spanish settlers and native people of Bolivia began to mix which has resulted in the majority of the city population being [[mestizo]]. When the Spanish settlers arrived to Bolivia, [[Catholicism]], as well as the Spanish language, were implemented onto the natives which is now why the city is predominantly Catholic and speak Spanish. Nevertheless, native religions and languages are still used by a minority of the population.<ref>Al Margen de mis Lecturas, by Marcelo Terceros Banzer. Published September 1998</ref>

There was a distinction between the ethno-demographic profile of the Santa Cruz de la Sierra region, marked by the mestizo, Spanish and eastern indigenous presence, in relation to the population of the Bolivian Altiplano, western part of the country mostly Andean indigenous with a smaller mestizo and Spanish presence.  However, in the last 60 years, large migrations from the western regions of Bolivia to Santa Cruz have transformed the demographics of the city and department redefining its social and ethnic spectrum.<ref>{{cite news |title=En 70 años, Santa Cruz pasó de 244 mil habitantes a más de 3 millones, y la migración sigue|url=https://www.noticiasfides.com/nacional/sociedad/en-70-anos-santa-cruz-paso-de-244-mil-habitantes-a-mas-de-3-millones-y-la-migracion-sigue-407505 |website=Agenciade Noticias Fides |date=2020}}</ref>  In recent years, external migration has also become noticeable in Santa Cruz.  Immigrants in Bolivia, especially in Santa Cruz have mainly originated from [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Spain]], [[Peru]], [[United States]] and [[Mexico]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Aumenta el número de inmigrantes en Bolivia|url=https://datosmacro.expansion.com/demografia/migracion/inmigracion/bolivia#:~:text=Los%20inmigrantes%20en%20Bolivia%20proceden,en%20Bolivia%2C%20no%20ha%20variado. |website=Datos Macro |date=2019}}</ref>

The city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra has utility infrastructure, roads and highways, and lively shopping and businesses. The main sectors that drive the economy are oil, forestry companies, [[agribusiness]], and construction.

Santa Cruz de la Sierra is served by Bolivia's largest airport, the [[Viru Viru International Airport]], with service on 14 airlines, 10 of which are from other countries, and 12 of them being passenger ones and two being cargo-only airlines. The airline [[AeroSur (Bolivia)|AeroSur]] had its headquarters in Santa Cruz.<ref>"[http://www.aerosur.com/en/index.php?cat=172&pla=1 Contact Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130075437/http://www.aerosur.com/en/index.php?cat=172&pla=1 |date=2010-01-30 }}." [[AeroSur (Bolivia)|AeroSur]]. Retrieved on February 27, 2010.</ref> The airline ceased operations in May 2012 and has been replaced by [[Boliviana de Aviación]], which flies from Santa Cruz to [[Miami]], [[Madrid]], [[São Paulo]], [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Lima]]. 

It was formerly linked with the Brazilian railway system through a line to [[Corumbá, Brazil]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Bolivia|first=Daniel|last=Eisenberg|author-link=:es:Daniel Eisenberg|journal=Journal of Hispanic Philology|volume=11|number=3|year=1987|pages=193–198|url=https://www.academia.edu/31844350}}</ref> This line, which was reputed to have a poor safety record, was abandoned after a highway to the Brazilian border was built in the 1980s.
