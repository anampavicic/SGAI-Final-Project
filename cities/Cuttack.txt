'''Cuttack''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=Cuttack.ogg|ˈ|k|ʌ|t|ə|k}}, or officially '''Kataka''' in [[Odia language|Odia]] {{IPA-or|ˈkɔʈɔkɔ|}}), is the former capital and the 2nd largest city in the Indian state of [[Odisha]]. It is the headquarters of the [[Cuttack district]]. The name of the city is an anglicised form of the [[Odia language|Odia]] and [[Sanskrit]] name ''Kataka'', which literally means ''The Fort'', a reference to the ancient [[Barabati Fort]] around which the city initially developed. Cuttack is known as the ''Millennium City'' as well as the ''Silver City'' due to its history of 1000 years and famous silver filigree works. The [[Orissa High Court]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cuttackroadmap_new2.asp|title=odisha high court location map|work=Odisha high court road map|publisher=Odisha Government|access-date=8 August 2014}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> is located there, and the city is the judiciary capital of Odisha. It is one of the commercial hubs of Odisha, which hosts many trading and business houses in and around the city. Cuttack is famous for its [[Durga Puja]], which is one of the most important [[festivals of Odisha]]. Being the favourite destination of poets and artists, it is also a cultural hub of Odisha. Due to its beauty, the term ''Kataka Nagara Dhabala Tagara'' is coined for it. The city is categorised as a [[Classification of Indian cities|Tier II]] city as per the ranking system used by the [[Government of India]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/tier-1-and-2-cities.html|title=Tier I and Tier II Cities map|work=Tier II Cities map|publisher =maps of India|access-date=24 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/10-indian-cities-quiet-peaceful-life-for-retirement/1/198976.html|title=Tier II and Tier III Cities|work=Tier II Cities|date=12 October 2013 |publisher=Business Today|access-date=24 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbmcw.com/reports/construction-infra-industry/30474-tier-ii-a-iii-cities-growth-engines-for-the-future.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715045352/http://www.nbmcw.com/reports/construction-infra-industry/30474-tier-ii-a-iii-cities-growth-engines-for-the-future.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 July 2013|title=Growth of Tier II and Tier III Cities|work=Tier II Cities growth|publisher=NBM Media|access-date=24 August 2014}}</ref>

The old and most important part of the city is centred on a strip of land between the [[Kathajodi River]] and the [[Mahanadi River]], bounded on the south-east by Old Jagannath Road.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmccuttack.gov.in/(S(1oirng45sr0ka255bqmljbz0))/geographical_details.html|title=Geographical Details of CMC|work=Geography|publisher=cuttack Municipal Corporation|access-date=24 August 2014}}</ref> The city, being a part of the [[Cuttack Municipal Corporation]] consisting of 59 wards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmccuttack.gov.in/overview_on_cmc.html|title=Welcome to Cuttack Municipal Corporation|work=Overview on CMC|publisher=cuttack Municipal Corporation|access-date=24 April 2018}}</ref> Cuttack stretches from Phulnakhara across the [[Kathajodi River|Kathajodi]] in the south to [[Choudwar]] in the north across the Birupa River, while in the east it begins at Kandarpur and runs west as far as Naraj. Four rivers, including [[Mahanadi River|Mahanadi]] and its distributaries [[Kathajodi River|Kathajodi]], [[Kuakhai River|Kuakhai]] and, Birupa, run through the city. Further Kathajodi is distributed into [[Devi River|Devi]] and Biluakhai, which often makes the geographical area look like fibrous roots.

Cuttack and [[Bhubaneswar]] are often referred to as the Twin Cities of Odisha. The metropolitan area formed by the two cities had a population of 1.862 million in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://citypopulation.de/world/Agglomerations.html|title=Major Agglomerations of the World|work=City Population|publisher=City Population, Germany|access-date=24 April 2018}}</ref> 
Cuttack, an unplanned city, is characterised by a maze of streets, lanes, and by-lanes, which have given it the nickname of a city with ''Bauna Bazaar, Tepana Galee'', i.e., 52 markets and 53 streets.

== Etymology ==
The name ''Cuttack'' is an anglicised form of ''Kataka'' ([[Odia language|Odia]]: କଟକ) which is derived from [[Sanskrit]], meaning capital, fort and military establishment, or a cantonment.<ref name="Bhoi">{{Cite journal|author1=Bhoi, Debendra Nath|author2=Bakshi, Priyadarshini|title=Historical Importance of Cuttack Town|journal=Orissa Historical Research Journal|volume=47|issue=2|pages=132–136|url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/journal/journal2/pdf/ohrj-018.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903144524/http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Journal/Journal2/pdf/ohrj-018.pdf|archive-date=3 September 2013}}</ref> The city was known as Bidanasi Kataka (meaning Bidanasi Military Base) during the days when [[Barabati Fort]] was in existence.

== History ==
The earliest written history of Cuttack may go back to the [[Keshari dynasty]].<ref name="Bhoi" /> As stated by the historian Andrew Stirling, present-day Cuttack was established as a military cantonment by king Nrupa Keshari of the Keshari dynasty in 989 CE. Stirling based his opinion on the [[Madala Panji]], a chronicle of the [[Jagannath]]a temple of [[Puri]].<ref>{{Cite book|author=Stirling, Andrew|year=1822|title=An account, geographical, statistical and historical of Orissa proper, or Cuttack|location=[Calcutta]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYkIAAAAQAAJ}}</ref> The reign of Maharaja Markata Keshari was distinguished for the stone embank built to protect the new capital from flooding in 1002 CE.

Historical and archaeological evidence suggests Cuttack became the capital of a kingdom founded by Raja Anangabhimadeva III of the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Ganga dynasty]] in 1211 CE.<ref name="Mohanty-PK">{{Cite journal|author=Mohanty, Pramod Kumar|year=2007|title=Cuttack : Carrying the Heritage of Orissa|journal=Orissa Review|volume=63|issue=1|pages=57–61|url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/jan-2007/engpdf/57-61.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727052933/http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/jan-2007/engpdf/57-61.pdf|archive-date=27 July 2014}}</ref> After the end of Ganga rule, [[Odisha]] passed to the hands of the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Suryavamsi Gajapati dynasty]] (1434–1541 CE), under whom Cuttack continued to be the capital of Odisha.<ref name="Mohanty-PK" /> After the death of Raja Mukunda deva,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Reddy|first=Krishna|year=2005|title=General Studies History 4 UPSC|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|page=B-32|isbn=978-0-07-060447-6}}</ref> the last Hindu [[List of rulers of Odisha|king of Orissa]], Cuttack first came under Muslim rule and later under [[Mughals]],<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Das, G.

By 1750, Cuttack came under the [[Maratha Empire]], and it grew fast as a business centre, being the convenient point of contact between the [[Bhonsle (clan)|Bhonsale]] Marathas of [[Kingdom of Nagpur|Nagpur]] and the [[East India Company|English merchants of Bengal]]. The term "Attock te Cuttack" ([[Attock]] to Cuttack) was first used to describe the extent of the [[Maratha Empire]] after they conquered Cuttack in 1750 and Attock in 1758. It was occupied by the British in 1803 and later became the capital of the Odisha division in 1816. From 1948 onwards, when the capital was shifted to [[Bhubaneswar]], the city remained the administrative headquarters for the state of [[Odisha]].

The introduction of the Sharadiya Utsav tradition in the city dates back to the visit of Saint Chaitanya in the 16th century, when the consecration of the idol of [[Durga]] by using the mask pattern was conducted in his presence at Binod Behari Devi Mandap.<ref>{{Cite web |last=TheIndianTrip |title=Cuttack tour Guide - India Information & Tips on Travel, Tourism & FAQs |url=https://theindiantrip.com/cuttack-city/info |access-date=2024-08-13 |website=TheIndianTrip |language=English}}</ref>

The remains of the old moated [[Barabati Fort]] still exist in the heart of Cuttack.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Mohanty, Arun K.|year=2000|title=Cuttack: City of the Fort|journal=Orissa Review|volume=2000|issue=7 (September)|pages=36–40}}</ref>

== Geography ==

Cuttack is located at {{Coord|20|31|23|N|085|47|17|E|}}<ref>{{GEOnet2|32FA8823083C3774E0440003BA962ED3|Cuttack Approved&nbsp;– N}}, [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|United States National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]</ref> and has an average elevation of {{convert|36|m|ft}}. The city is spread across an area of {{convert|192.5|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. The city is a [[Cuttack Municipal Corporation]], which consists of 59 wards. The city stretches from Phulnakhara in south to Choudwar in north and Kandarpur in east to Naraj in west, while the main city is located at the apex of the [[Mahanadi River]] delta.  Apart from Mahanadi, four of its distributaries also run through the city. The distributaries include Mahanadi, Kathajodi, Kuakhai, and Birupa, where Kathajodi further has two distributaries, the right being Devi while the left is Biluakhai. Mahanadi runs through the city on the northern side, separating the main city from the Jagatpur Industrial Area. The Kathajodi River forms a riverine island of Bayalis Mouza (42 Wards) after separating the main city from Gopalpur. The Kuakhai River separates the southern part of the city into two halves, namely Pratap Nagri and the new township of Naranpur. The Kuakhai runs throughout the south of the city along Phulnakhara before entering Bhubaneswar. The Birupa river runs through the north of Jagatpur Industrial Area, separating it from Choudwar. There are numerous ponds known as (''pokharis'') in the city that store rainwater. The Mahanadi provides much of the drinking water to the city.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Panigrahi |first1=Subhashree |last2=Patra |first2=A.

CDA has 15 sectors out of which 11 are residential and has a population of around {{formatnum:150000}}. Jagatpur and Mahanadi Vihar are the other two townships in the city. [[Mahanadi Vihar]] is the first satellite city project in [[Odisha]]. Cuttack is referred to as a city with ''Baaban Bazaar, Teppan Galee'', i.e., this is the city of 52 markets and 53 streets, which is told by people of [[Odisha]] for the largeness of this city.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Saraf |first=Tanvi |date=2020-11-09 |title=Architecture of Indian Cities—Cuttack: Odisha's Silver City |url=https://www.re-thinkingthefuture.com/rtf-fresh-perspectives/a2060-architecture-of-indian-cities-cuttack-odishas-silver-city/ |access-date=2024-09-09 |website=RTF {{!}} Rethinking The Future |language=en-US}}</ref> Naranpur is another satellite township coming up in Trishulia, on the other side of the [[Kathajodi River]].

=== Climate ===
Cuttack experiences a [[tropical wet and dry climate]]. The summer season is from March to June, when the climate is hot and humid. The temperature around this season is 35&nbsp;°C to 40&nbsp;°C. Thunderstorms are common at the height of the summer. The monsoon months are from July to October, when the city receives most of its rainfall from the South West Monsoon.

* [[Durga Puja in Odisha|Durga Puja]]: Cuttack is famous throughout the nation for its Durga puja celebrations. Nearly 200 earthen idols of Goddess Durga are prepared by the different puja committees of the city to worship Goddess Durga. The speciality of Cuttack Durga Puja is its Durga Puja ''Suna Medha'', in which the idols are adorned with huge amounts of gold and silver, with localities trying to outsmart each other by constructing more attractive idols. Cuttack celebrates Durga Puja with full energy on Maha Saptami, Maha Ashtami, Maha Navami, and [[Vijayadashami|Vijaya Dashami or Dussehra]] by burning an effigy of the demon [[Ravana]]. People from all of [[Odisha]] and nearby states visit Cuttack during this period to observe the famous festival.
*[[Boita Bandana]]: This festival is celebrated on the last day of the holy Hindu month of [[Kartik (month)|Kartik]]. On this auspicious day, people flow miniature boitas or model boats in the Mahanadi and Kathajodi rivers to pay homage to the ancient merchants of [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga Kingdom]]. This day also marks the beginning of [[Bali Jatra]]. This festival is similar to the ''Masakapam Kepesih'' festival of [[Bali]],<ref>{{citation |title=Kalinga Maritime history |publisher=Indo Nordic Author's Collective |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344443146 |author=Uday Dokras |date=October 2020 |access-date=9 February 2021 }}</ref> and to the ''[[Loi Krathong]]'' festival of [[Thailand]], both of which involve ritualistic floating of model boats around the same time of year.
*[[Bali Jatra]]: The festival to which the people of Cuttack await the most is the [[Bali Jatra]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baliyatra.org/|title=Bali Jatra|work=Online Webpage Bali Jatra|publisher=Directorate of Culture, Cuttack|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809131653/http://baliyatra.org/|archive-date=9 August 2014|url-status=dead|access-date=8 August 2014}}</ref> Bali Yatra is supposedly the second largest trade festival in Asia and the largest in India. The name Bali Jatra literally means ''A Voyage to Bali''. In olden times, merchants used to trade with the Southeast Asian island countries of [[Bali]], [[Java]], [[Sumatra]], and [[Borneo]]. Whatever items they brought from those places after trading Oriya goods used to be put up for sale in the capital (which was then Cuttack). People from all over the state and beyond used to come to Cuttack to buy these items. [[Bali Jatra]] is the festival of continuing this ancient tradition. It is held every year in November on the banks of the [[Mahanadi River|Mahanadi]]. Many stalls are set up, selling both local and exotic goods. People from all over Odisha come to the Bali Jatra to buy items, as was the custom back in those days.
* [[Kali puja]]: This festival is dedicated to the Hindu goddess [[Kali]] and is celebrated on the new moon day of the Hindu month of Kartik. It coincides with the pan-Indian festival of [[Diwali]] amidst the bursting of [[firecrackers]]. [[File:Balijatra cuttack.JPG|thumb|Bali Jatra Entrance Gate]]
* [[Kartikeya|Kartikeshwar Puja]]: The puja in Cuttack is organised by the puja committees of Cuttack. This festival is observed to worship [[Kartikeya]], the eldest son of [[Lord Shiva]]. Nowhere else except [[Sabarimala]] is the Kartikeswar puja carried out with so much elan.
* Bada Osha: This is unique to Dhabaleswar Temple. Special Bhoga, namely Gaja and Tarana, are prepared on this day for the worshippers.
* [[Manabasa Gurubara]] was unique to Cuttack Odisha, later celebrated by east Odisha; west Odisha is worship to goddess [[Laxmi]].
* [[Kite]] flying is also celebrated with much enthusiasm and energy in the city. Kite-flying culminates with the Makar Sankranti, with kite-flying competitions being held all over. Cuttack is the first city in [[East India|Eastern India]] to introduce kite-flying.

=== Lal Bagh Palace ===
Situated on the bank of the [[Kathajodi River|Kathjodi]], the Lal Bagh Palace at Cuttack has a long and colorful history. This building witnessed the rise and fall of several rulers who controlled the fortune of Odisha. It was constructed by the Mughal Subedar stationed at Cuttack. Subsequently, the property passed into the hands of the Marathas. Over the years the premises have undergone several alterations and modifications. [[William Burton (antiquary, died 1645)|William Bruton]] visited Cuttack in 1633, when the Lal Bagh Palace was under construction. In 1741, Saulat Jung, the Naib Nazim, fixed his residence in the palace. The building was occupied by the Naib Nazims till 1751 and by the representatives of the [[Bhonsle|Bhonslas]] of Nagpur from 1751 to 1803. Lal Bagh came into the possession of the British in 1803 when Colonel Harcourt's men defeated the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] soldiers. The Lal Bagh Palace was apparently leased out but again came into the possession of Government, who sold it in January 1862, and the purchaser sold the estate along with the building to the East India Irrigation Company. In 1863, the building came into the possession of the Government when they took over the irrigation works from the company. Since 1868 the building was occupied by Commissioners and sometimes by Collectors. In 1896, Shri R.C. Dutt, the then Commissioner, who was also a well-known historian, lived in this building. In a letter to his daughter, he describes the building as "the best-situated Commissioner's house." The building which was still under the Irrigation Branch was transferred to the Buildings and Roads Branch of the Government in 1914. In 1941, Shri K.C. Gajapati Narayan Deo, Maharaja of Parlakimedi and [[Prime Minister of Orissa|Premier of Orissa]], fixed his residence at the Lal Bagh palace for a time. On 18 July 1942, the Lal Bagh Palace became the new Government House. Sir Hawthorne Lewis was the first Governor to live in the Lal Bagh Palace. This historic building, which stood witness to countless political and social upheavals during [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]], [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] and [[British Raj|British]] rule in Odisha, became the center of administration. The Lal Bagh Palace continued to serve as the residence of the Governor till 1960. During the tenure of Shri Sukthankar in 1960, the [[Raj Bhavan, Bhubaneswar|Raj Bhavan]] was shifted from Cuttack to Bhubaneswar. Shri Sukthankar generously donated the building to the [[Indian Red Cross Society]] to utilize it as a children's hospital. The Government of Orissa [now, Odisha] took over this hospital in 1966 and made it an independent institute for post-graduate training and research. At present, the institute is known as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Post Graduate Institute of Pediatrics, and is popularly known as Shishu Bhavan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rajbhavanodisha.gov.in/history.asp|title=Rajbhavan Odisha : History|website=www.rajbhavanodisha.gov.in|language=EN|access-date=29 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014105650/http://www.rajbhavanodisha.gov.in/history.asp|archive-date=14 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Shree Gopal Krishna Goshala ===
The antiquity of this old complex is not exactly known. Old timers of Cuttack call it the [[Goshala]], but it was originally a Dharamshala for the pilgrims of the old Jagannath Sadak. Just 100 metres from the Nayabazar Chhak, on the far end of the city, it lay right by the side of the old road. This stretch of the Jagannath Sadak, from the Mahanadi till the Kathjori Ghat was once a 100 feet wide road. During the monsoons, when the Mahanadi was often in spate, pilgrims often had to camp for days to make the crossing; the Dharamshala was built well away from the flood plain, right between the two rivers. The place was originally set up as a Dharamshala by one ''Seth Jagannath Halan'' of Calcutta. It was a huge complex with rooms and halls for the pilgrims. There was a big tank and wells dug inside the complex and a large pond, which still exists. It was the largest Dharamshala of the old road and could house a thousand pilgrims. There was a separate accommodation block for the ''Sadhus'' and ''Mahants'' who traveled on the old road. Many of the pilgrims camped under the huge trees. In 1905, two benevolent Marwaris of Salkia in Howrah District, ''Seth Bishen Dayal'' and ''Seth Hari Dayal'', took over the abandoned Dharamshala and transformed it into a Goshala. There is a marble plaque which says that the ''Victoria Gorakhini Sabha'' opened the Goshala in the place in 1905. They made some alterations and repairs to the old building and made it into a charitable institution rendering service for old and infirm cattle.
