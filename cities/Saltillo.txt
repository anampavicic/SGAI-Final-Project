'''Saltillo''' ({{IPA|es-419|salˈtiʝo|lang|Es-saltillo.oga}}) is the capital and largest city of the northeastern [[Mexican State|Mexican state]] of [[Coahuila]] and is also the municipal seat of the [[Saltillo Municipality|municipality of the same name]]. [[Mexico City]], [[Monterrey]], and Saltillo are all connected by a major railroad and highway. As of a 2020 census, Saltillo had a population of 879,958 people, while the population of its [[Metropolitan areas of Mexico|metropolitan area]] was 1,031,779, making Saltillo the largest city in the state of [[Coahuila]], and the 14th most populated metropolitan area in the country.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Anguiano |first=José Torres |title=Supera Zona Metropolitana de Saltillo el millón de habitantes |url=https://www.elheraldodesaltillo.mx/2021/01/25/supera-zona-metropolitana-de-saltillo-el-millon-de-habitantes/ |access-date=2022-11-01 |website=El Heraldo de Saltillo |date=January 26, 2021 |language=es}}</ref>

Saltillo is one of the most industrialized cities in Mexico and has one of the largest [[automotive industry|automotive]] industries in the country, with plants such as Tupy, Grupo Industrial Saltillo, [[General Motors]], [[Stellantis]], [[Daimler AG]], [[Freightliner Trucks]], [[BorgWarner]], [[Plastic Omnium]], [[Magna International|Magna]], and [[Nemak]] operating in the region. The city and its metropolitan area also house a large number of plants providing manufactured goods to various other multinational companies, including [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]]'s new plant in Mexico, located less than an hour away in the neighboring [[Santa Catarina, Nuevo León]]. Saltillo is a prominent manufacturing hub noted for its commerce, communications, and manufacturing of products both traditional and modern.

==History==
===Colonial era===
[[File:Barrio ojo de agua.jpg|alt=Ojo de Agua Neighborhood|left|thumb|Parish of the Holy Christ of the ''Ojo de Agua'', today recognized as the site of the founding of the city.]]
Founded in 1577 by Conquistador [[Alberto del Canto]] as ''Villa de Santiago del Saltillo'', it is one of<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pesquera |first=Servicio de Información Agroalimentaria y |title=Fundación de la ciudad de Durango |url=http://www.gob.mx/siap/articulos/fundacion-de-la-ciudad-de-durango |access-date=2023-08-24 |website=gob.mx |language=es}}</ref> the oldest post-conquest settlements in Northern Mexico. It can be ascertained that the name of the city comes from a small waterfall that draws water from a spring. Nowadays, the spring is located within the Parish of the Holy Christ of the ''Ojo de Agua'' and is still visited by the local population.<ref name="diariojudio">{{cite web |url=https://diariojudio.com/comunidad-judia-mexico/alberto-del-canto-fundo-las-ciudades-de-monterrey-y-saltillo-y-bautizo-al-cerro-de-la-silla/14844/ |title=Alberto Del Canto, founded the cities of Monterrey and Saltillo and baptized the Cerro de la Silla |publisher=Jewish Newspaper |date =February 24, 2014 }}</ref>

In 1591, the Spanish resettled a community of their [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcaltec]] allies in a separate town, [[San Esteban de Nueva Tlaxcala]], located just across an irrigation ditch from Saltillo.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Esparza Cárdenas |first=Rodolfo |title=Encuentros en Coahuila |publisher=Grupo Editorial Miguel Ángel Porrúa |year=2004 |isbn=970-701-449-0 |editor-last=Arreola Pérez |editor-first=Jesús Alfonso & Rodrigo Borja Torres |pages=71–75 |language=es |chapter=San Esteban de la Nueva Tlaxcala: Expresión postrera de lucha libertaria y contrainstitucional}}</ref> The measure was taken in order to aid stalled colonization efforts and cultivate the land. In its early years, Saltillo grew slowly due to the hostility of the indigenous [[Chichimeca War|Chichimeca]] people<ref>{{harvp|Offutt|2001|p=55}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2005 |title=Saltillo, Coahuila |encyclopedia=Enciclopedia de Los Municipios de México |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/coahuila/mpios/05030a.htm |author=INAFED (Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal) |publisher=Secretaría de Gobernación |edition=online version at E-Local |access-date=2008-03-28 |language=es |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520133556/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/coahuila/mpios/05030a.htm |archive-date=May 20, 2007}}. The Tlaxcalteca community remained legally separate until the 19th century.</ref> and frequent water shortages. A hundred years after its founding, its population was only about 300 people, whilst the population of the adjacent Tlaxcaltec town, [[San Esteban de Nueva Tlaxcala|San Esteban]], was about 1,750.<ref>Jones, Jr., Oakah L.

Ethnic Integrity and Consciousness in Late Seventeenth-Century Northern New Spain," ''The Americas,'' Vol 64, No. 3, pp. 33. Downloaded from [[Project MUSE]].</ref>

In the eighteenth century, Saltillo was a commercial center on the northern frontier which served as a bridge from central Mexico to regions further northeast such as the [[New Kingdom of León]], [[New Santander]], [[Nueva Extremadura|Coahuila]], and [[Spanish Texas|Texas]].<ref>{{harvp|Offutt|2001}}</ref> It also supplied the silver mines of [[Zacatecas]] with wheat.<ref>{{harvp|Offutt|2001|p=187}}</ref> It never rose to great prominence, but it did develop a commercial core and an agricultural and ranching sector that supplied its needs, with surpluses that could be sold. Saltillo became administratively important at the end of the eighteenth century, when a branch of the [[Royal Treasury]] was established in the city.<ref>{{harvp|Offutt|2001|p=9}}</ref>[[File:Acueducto de Saltillo en Coahuila.png|thumb|left|Historical aqueduct]]Merchants, most of whom were [[Iberian Peninsula]]-born Spaniards, constituted the most important economic group, handling a wide variety of goods and selling in shops.<ref>{{harvp|Offutt|2001|p=10}}</ref> They were the provincial branch of the transatlantic merchant sector, with ties to [[Mexico City]] merchants. Peninsular merchants in Saltillo married into the local elite society, acquired rural properties, and sought local office.<ref>{{harvp|Offutt|2001|p=50}}</ref>

In the late seventeenth century, an annual trade fair was established, which carried Mexican livestock and manufactured goods to places as far as China and Europe. Saltillo could produce wheat commercially as long as there was access to water, but as with many other parts of the North, drought was a consistent threat. In the eighteenth century, there was a demand for draft animals, which Saltillo supplied.<ref>{{harvp|Offutt|2001|p=100}}</ref>

===Early Mexico===
In 1824, Saltillo was made the capital of the [[States of Mexico|state]] of [[Coahuila y Tejas]], substituting [[Monclova|Santiago de la Monclova]] as such. Three years later, Mexican Constituting Congress sanctioned that the city's name be changed to [[Leona Vicario]], after one of the few female figures of the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. However, in 1831, a new State Congress decree merged Leona Vicario with the contiguous town of San Esteban (renamed Villalongín) and the name was changed back to Saltillo.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Esparza Cárdenas |first=Rodolfo |date=2010 |title=El ocaso del Pueblo de San Esteban de la Nueva Tlaxcala |url=http://ahc.sfpcoahuila.gob.mx/admin/uploads/documentos/modulo11/bolmayo.pdf |journal=Boletín Digital de Información del AGEC |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=21}}</ref>

For nearly a decade, Saltillo held the administrative seat of a territory which included Coahuila alongside most of the territory of the current [[States of the US|U.S. state]] of [[Texas]] until it was [[Treaties of Velasco|lost]] in the 1836 in the [[Texas Revolution]]. The [[Republic of Texas]] continued to have [[Nueces Strip|border disputes]] with Mexico's [[Centralist Mexico|Centralist Republic]], which continued to object to its independence. Peace was further disturbed by [[Comanche]] and [[Apache]] raiding, private vendettas, and separatist movements. On October 23, 1840, the [[Battle of Saltillo]] took place when 110 [[Texians]] and [[Tejanos]] crossed the [[Rio Grande]] to attack the city's government in support of an attempt to create a separate [[Republic of the Rio Grande]] between Texas and Mexico.<ref>{{harvp|Brown|1893|pp=173–174}}</ref>

In 1845, Texas was [[annexation of Texas|annexed]] by the United States and its disputes with Mexico, aggravated by the [[Polk Administration]], soon expanded into the [[Mexican–American War]]. The first phase of the war ended in September 1846 with [[Zachary Taylor|Gen.{{nbsp}}Zachary Taylor]]'s [[Battle of Monterrey|hard-won siege]] and occupation of [[Monterrey]] in [[Nuevo León]]. The [[U.S. Department of War|War Department]] ordered him to remain there, but Taylor violated the [[armistice]] and went with [[William J. Worth|Gen.{{nbsp}}William Worth]] and 1200 men to occupy Saltillo on 16 November to protect the approaches to [[Army of Occupation (Mexico)|his main army]] in Monterrey.<ref>{{citation |last=Jenkins |first=John Stilwell |authorlink= |title=History of the War between the United States and Mexico |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_the_War_between_the_United_States_and_Mexico |page=[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_the_War_between_the_United_States_and_Mexico/Chapter_5#190 190] |date=1849 |location=Auburn |publisher=Derby, Miller, & Co }}.</ref> [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] had been allowed through the [[Blockade of Veracruz|blockade]] of [[Veracruz City|Veracruz]] to bring the war to a swift conclusion but had instead rallied the [[Army of Mexico|Mexican army]] and moved north. [[John E. Wool|Gen.{{nbsp}}John E. Wool]] was sent to nearby Agua Nueva on December 21 and the indecisive [[Battle of Buena Vista]] occurred {{convert|12|mi|km|sp=us}} from Saltillo between February 22 and 23,1847, after which López de Santa Anna's army was forced to move south to protect [[San Luis Potosí City|San Luis Potosí]] and counter a [[Siege of Veracruz|seaborne invasion]] by [[Winfield Scott|Gen.{{nbsp}}Winfield Scott]].

===Porfiriato and Mexican Revolution===
Modernity reached [[Coahuila]] with the arrival of the railroad in 1880, during the [[Porfiriato]]. In 1890, telegraph, telephone, and street lighting networks were created in addition to the construction of cultural buildings, including theaters and plazas, and buildings of a social nature such as hospices, civil hospitals, and sanitary structures consisting of drinking water and drainage systems.

During the 1910{{ndash}}1920 [[Mexican Revolution]], Saltillo was occupied in separate events by the forces of [[Victoriano Huerta]], [[Francisco Villa]], and then by those of [[Venustiano Carranza]]. Hundreds of peasants were forced to join these various groups. As a result, many fled to Texas, including aristocratic families.

===20th century===

In 1923 the [[Universidad Autónoma Agraria Antonio Narro|Antonio Narro Agrarian University]] was founded.<ref>{{cite web |title=UAAN - This is UAAN |url=http://www.uaaan.mx/v2/index.php/component/content/article/9-english-news/26-this-is-uaaan.html |website=Universidad Autónoma Agraria Antonio Narro }}{{Dead link|date=July 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Two decades later in 1943, the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education]] was established in the city, then in 1951, the [[Instituto Tecnológico de Saltillo|Technological Institute of Saltillo]] and in 1957, the [[Autonomous University of Coahuila]] was established.

Saltillo's agricultural climate in the second half of the 20th century was rapidly transforming into industrial activity; huge orchards disappeared and factories began to dominate the landscape.

In the second quarter of the twentieth century, Saltillo changed from agricultural and textile activities towards industrial activities, with the creation of companies such as CIFUNSA, CINSA, Éxito, and Molinos el Fénix, among others.

The true industrial explosion occurred in the '70s and '80s with the arrival of the car industry to the region. Companies such as [[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]], along with their respective satellite companies or suppliers, came to Saltillo. Since then, Saltillo and its Metropolitan Zone (Ramos Arizpe and Arteaga) are known as the "[[Detroit]] of [[Mexico]]". However, a movement is currently underway to diversify the industry, with the arrival of pharmaceutical companies, household appliances, chemicals, ceramics, and even parts for the [[aerospace]] industry.

==Geography==
El Cerro del Pueblo (The Town Hill) and its {{convert|4|m|ft|adj=on}} cross overlook the city. The city's elevation makes it colder and windier than the neighboring city of [[Monterrey]]. Saltillo lies in the [[Chihuahuan Desert]] near the city of [[Arteaga, Coahuila|Arteaga]]. The city is flanked by the [[Zapalinamé mountains]], which are part of the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]]. According to local legend, by looking at the relief of the mountains one can see the relief of [[Zapalinamé]], chieftain of the [[Guachichil]] tribe who rose against the Spaniards in 1584.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-07-16 |title=Zapalinamé, un guerrero que lucha por la vida |url=https://vanguardia.com.mx/vida/zapaliname-un-guerrero-que-lucha-por-la-vida-ITVG3471328 |access-date=2023-08-24 |website=vanguardia.com.mx |language=es-MX}}</ref>

====Land El Aguaje====

Located in the San Lorenzo Canyon southeast of the city of Saltillo. Composed of geological formations originated between the Upper Jurassic and Quaternary that facilitate the intense infiltration of water to the subsoil, thus allowing the constant recharge of the aquifers that supply drinking water to the city of Saltillo.On July 3, 2008, the Government of the State of Coahuila decided to buy the property, which was granted to Mexican Wildlife Protection in bailment on July 23, 2012, for its management and conservation.<ref>{{Cite web |title=San Lorenzo Canyon |url=http://www.zapaliname.org/canon-de-san-lorenzo |access-date=September 9, 2019 |archive-date=August 20, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190820215123/https://www.zapaliname.org/canon-de-san-lorenzo |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Climate===
Saltillo has a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BSh'', bordering ''BSk''). Saltillo is located in the [[Chihuahuan Desert]] but temperatures are cooler than other desert cities in Mexico because it is located at an altitude of 1,600 meters (5,250&nbsp;ft). Summers are slightly hot with cool nights, and winters are sunny but cool. Rainfall is scarce but more prominent in summer. Snowfall and sub-freezing temperatures are not unknown, but do not occur every year.

==Culture==

[[File:Matlachinada 2014.jpg|thumbnail|upright |Matlachinada 2014. Event held every year, with Matachines from all over the state of Coahuila.]]
Saltillo's local culture shares many features with the larger [[Northern Mexico|Northern Mexican]] culture. However, it has various particularities that denote a great cultural and historical wealth. Some of them are highlighted below.

=== Matachines ===
The ''danza de matachines'' is a carnivalesque dance that, in addition to being performed in Saltillo, is performed in various locations ranging from the US state of [[New Mexico]] to the Mexican states of [[Jalisco]], [[Nayarit]], [[Aguascalientes]], [[Zacatecas]], [[San Luis Potosí]], [[Nuevo León]] and [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Desconocido |first=México |date=2010-06-24 |title=Los matachines: soldados de la Virgen (Chihuahua) |url=https://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/los-matachines-soldados-de-la-virgen-chihuahua.html |access-date=2023-08-24 |website=México Desconocido |language=es}}</ref> As a cultural manifestation, this dance has controversial origins. Cruz Viveros, an academic from Veracruz, points out that it must have arrived in America with the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Conquest]], since it is similar to the [[Morisca|Moorish]] dances that were already used in [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Italy]] and [[France]] since the [[Middle Ages]]. According to him, in Mexico the dance would have been subject to a process of redefinition with which it would have been intended to attribute an indigenous origin. From this moment on, the event in which it takes place began to be called ''matlachinada'', whereas the dancers, were dubbed ''matlachines'' (both terms supposedly derived from the [[Nahuatl]] word "matlatzinca")''.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Cruz Viveros |first=Sabino |date=2021 |title=Matachines o matlachines: una revisión del constructo |url=http://www.revistaimagenes.esteticas.unam.mx/matachines-o-matlachines |journal=Imágenes |location=Mexico City |publisher=Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas, UNAM}}</ref>''

Regardless of its possible European origins, the dance that is performed in Saltillo in honor of the Holy Christ, incorporates in its costumes and choreography various elements that, at least, belong to the Mexican imaginary of "the indigenous" and, at most, can be attributed to the Tlaxcaltecs. Among these elements we find bows and arrows, headdresses with multicolored feathers, little stones, decorated skirts and sandals. In addition, the dance is organized by the inhabitants of the ''Ojo de Agua'' neighborhood, formerly inhabited by people of Tlaxcaltec origin.

===Sarape de Saltillo===

The ''[[sarape]]'' (serape, or jorongo) is a rectangular garment, for male use, with or without opening for the head and multicolored stripes which are reminiscent of a rainbow. It is one of the most representative objects of Mexico. The serape is a garment of traditional Mexican men's clothing, usually brightly colored and with traditional patterns. It is usually made of wool fiber that maintains heat more efficiently, but is also woven from cotton. The thickness of the yarn chosen for the fabric, as well as its material, the elaboration of each necessary knot and the final size of the serape, are variables that influence the final weight and feel of the serape. It is traditional from various parts of Mexico, as in Saltillo. In fact, it was colonizers of Tlaxcalan origin who took the serape to Coahuila from Zaragoza, Zacatecas and probably to New Mexico.

It serves as a coat, blanket, bedspread, tablecloth or cape. It also decorates walls and floors, as a tapestry or carpet. Another use is to put it on the horse before climbing to the saddle.

===Pulque bread===

Pulque bread is a tradition deeply rooted in the town and is highly sought after by the people of Saltillo. Its preparation, based on wheat flour, water or milk, egg and, sometimes, lard is similar to that of other Mexican sweet breads. However, it differs by including [[pulque]], which is a fermented drink obtained from the [[Agave americana|agave]] plant, as a fermentation agent. This gives it a characteristic flavor, sweetness and moisture. With this dough, pecan empanadas, chorreadas, muffins, braid bread, bishops, etc. are made. Although for many the city of Saltillo is synonymous with this bread, in reality its production constitutes, along that in a handful of neighboring towns, a relatively isolated focus of its production in Northeastern Mexico. Such is the case that outside of Saltillo, pulque bread can be found in the Mexican states of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], [[Puebla]], [[Querétaro]], [[Mexico City]], [[Oaxaca]] and, of course, [[Tlaxcala]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pan de pulque ⋆ Larousse Cocina |url=https://laroussecocina.mx/palabra/pan-de-pulque/ |access-date=2023-08-24 |website=Larousse Cocina |language=es}}</ref>

===The Saltillo Rondalla of the UAAAN===

The city of Saltillo is known for its [[rondalla]], being the highest representative of the Rondallesque movement in Mexico for more than four decades. The '' 'Rondalla de Saltillo' '' went beyond transposing the established limits and creating its own style. It has multiple recordings and has toured several countries, it is characterized by using guitars, requintos, double bass, and vocals. The poet Marco Antonio Aguirre arrived at La Rondalla de Saltillo in 1966 and wrote his story with tours, and 30 recorded albums.

==Sports==
[[File:Saraperos4.jpg|thumb|[[Estadio de Béisbol Francisco I. Madero|Francisco I. Madero Ballpark]]]]
Saltillo is a city with a long [[baseball]] tradition. In fact, some sources indicate that the sport began to be practiced in town at the end of the 19th century.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-09-04 |title=El primer equipo de beisbol en Saltillo |url=https://vanguardia.com.mx/coahuila/saltillo/el-primer-equipo-de-beisbol-en-saltillo-MJ586952 |access-date=2023-08-24 |website=vanguardia.com.mx |language=es-MX}}</ref> However, its representative team, the [[Saraperos de Saltillo]], did not arrive in the [[Mexican League|Mexican Baseball League]] until 1970. They had their origins in a dinner held by the members of the Pro-Works Committee of the Saltillo Cathedral, whose president was Mr. Jorge Torres Casso. They currently hold three championships, in 1980, 2009 and 2010, and eight division titles, in 1971, 1972, 1973, 1988, 2004, 2005, 2009 and 2010.
