'''Bocaue''' {{IPA|tl|bɔˈkawɛ|}}, officially the '''Municipality of Bocaue''' ({{lang-tgl|Bayan ng Bocaue}}), is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Bulacan]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 141,412 people.{{PH census|current}}

With the continuous expansion of [[Metro Manila]], Bocaue is part of [[Greater Manila Area|Manila's built-up area]] which reaches [[San Ildefonso, Bulacan|San Ildefonso]] in its northernmost part. The Bocaue River runs through most of the municipality.

Among its tourist attractions are a town museum located near the municipality's center and the town's [[Bocaue River Festival|river festival]] celebrated on the first Sunday of every July. The river festival is in commemoration of the [[Christian cross|Holy Cross]] of Wawa, believed to be miraculous by the town's predominantly Roman Catholic population.

==Etymology==
The town's name comes from the [[Old Tagalog]] word "''Bukawe''", which refers to a type of long bamboo (''[[Schizostachyum lima|Schyzostachyum lima]]'').

==History==
Bocaue was first established by Franciscan missionaries as a [[barrio]] and visita of [[Meycauayan]] in 1582 and as a [[town]] on April 11, 1606, under the advocacy of [[Martin of Tours|San Martin de Tours]]. It was the first town to be granted independence from the old Meycauayan that was then a very large town comprising the present territories of Meycauayan City, [[Marilao, Bulacan|Marilao]], [[Santa Maria, Bulacan|Santa Maria]], [[San Jose del Monte|San Jose del Monte City]], [[Obando, Bulacan|Obando]], and [[Valenzuela, Philippines|Valenzuela City]].

After the [[Philippine–American War]], the [[Philippine Commission]] was established, part of whose functions was the reorganization of Philippine municipalities and provinces. In 1903, Bulacan province reduced the number of towns from 26 to 19. The town of [[Balagtas, Bulacan|Balagtas]] merged with Bocaue, with the former serving as the seat of government from October 8 to November 20 before it was transferred to the latter.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=932|date=October 8, 1903|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%20932|title=An Act Reducing the Twenty-five Municipalities of the Province of Bulacan to Thirteen|accessdate=July 3, 2023|website=Senate of the Philippines Legislative Digital Resources|archive-date=October 21, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231021150820/https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%20932|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=1002|date=November 20, 1903|title=An Act Amending; Act Numbered Nine Hundred and Thirty-two, Entitled "an Act Reducing the Twenty-five Municipalities of the Province of Bulacan to Thirteen."|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%201002|accessdate=July 3, 2023|website=Senate of the Philippines Legislative Digital Resources|archive-date=October 21, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231021150907/https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%201002|url-status=live}}</ref> Bocaue later regained its independence and was reestablished as a town in 1911.

During the Bocaue River Festival of July 2, 1993, around 500 people rode the "floating pagoda" for the Holy Cross of Wawa way beyond the boat's capacity and caused the boat to sink, killing more than two hundred people. Despite the lives lost, no one has been made accountable for the tragedy. This incident became known as the [[Bocaue Pagoda Tragedy]].

On the morning of December 31, 2007, [[December 2007 Bocaue Fire|ten fireworks stores burned]] in [[Barangay]] Turo, causing a series of explosions within the area and injuring 7 people.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bulacan, Philippines: Bocaue, Bulacan: History|url=https://www.bulacan.gov.ph/bocaue/history.php#:~:text=Bocaue%20was%20just%20a%20mere,gradually%20during%20the%20American%20regime.|access-date=August 9, 2021|website=www.bulacan.gov.ph|archive-date=September 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210925220631/https://www.bulacan.gov.ph/bocaue/history.php#:~:text=Bocaue%20was%20just%20a%20mere,gradually%20during%20the%20American%20regime.|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=December 27, 2019|first=Mario Alvaro|last=Limos|title=The History of How Bulacan Became the Country's Fireworks Mecca|url=https://www.esquiremag.ph/long-reads/features/bulacan-fireworks-history-a00293-20191227-lfrm|access-date=August 9, 2021|website=Esquiremag.ph|archive-date=August 9, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210809010155/https://www.esquiremag.ph/long-reads/features/bulacan-fireworks-history-a00293-20191227-lfrm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Bocaue remembers 1993 pagoda tragedy|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/bocaue-pagoda-tragedy-survivors|access-date=August 9, 2021|website=Rappler|language=en|archive-date=July 9, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709185246/https://www.rappler.com/nation/bocaue-pagoda-tragedy-survivors|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Geography==
Bocaue is {{convert|27|km|sp=us}} north-east of [[Manila]] if reached via the [[MacArthur Highway]] and is {{convert|18|km|sp=us}} from [[Malolos City]]. It is at the mid-southwestern portion of Bulacan. Its land area is 3,187 hectares or 31.87&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (12.31 sq mi).

The town is bounded on the north by the municipality of [[Balagtas, Bulacan|Balagtas]] and a portion of the municipality of [[Santa Maria, Bulacan|Santa Maria]]; by the municipalities of [[Marilao, Bulacan|Marilao]] and [[Obando, Bulacan|Obando]] on the south; a larger portion of Santa Maria on the east; a portion of the municipality of [[Bulakan]] on the extreme southwestern side; and a portion of Balagtas on the western side.

Bocaue is traversed by the Bocaue River, a continuation of the confluence of [[Santa Maria River (Philippines)|Santa Maria River]] and San Jose River and a few other minor rivers and creeks, all of which are distributaries of the [[Angat Watershed Forest Reserve|Angat drainage basin]]. The main source of [[Angat River]] and the Angat drainage basin, as well as their distributaries, is the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] mountain range. Along these rivers are many man-made fish ponds used for raising and farming fish like [[Bangus#Aquaculture|bangus]] and [[tilapia]].

Bocaue, along with Balagtas, [[Guiguinto]], and [[Pandi, Bulacan|Pandi]], was once known as comprising the [[Bulacan's 2nd congressional district|2nd district]] of Bulacan. The grouping would later be known as the 5th district of Bulacan.

===Barangays===
Bocaue is politically subdivided into 19 [[barangay]]s. Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s and some have [[sitios]].
