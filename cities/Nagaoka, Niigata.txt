==Geography==
[[File:Nagaoka from the sky.jpg|thumb|Nagaoka in winter from the sky]]

Nagaoka is in the center of Niigata prefecture and the surrounding [[Chūetsu]] region of Japan, between [[138th meridian east|longitude 138°E]] and [[37th parallel north|latitude 37°N]]. It is 80 minutes from [[Tokyo]] by way of the [[Joetsu Shinkansen]] or three hours on the [[Kan-Etsu Expressway]] and is considered a strategic traffic point in the region. Nagaoka was an inland city until January 1, 2006, when the city merged with four municipalities; two were touching the [[Sea of Japan]]. The [[Shinano River]] flows through the city from south to north and industrial development is on both banks of the river. The Higashiyama mountain range lies to the east.

[[File:Echigo no kuni Uesugi Kagekatsu katoku arasoi kassen.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Ukiyo-e]] of the [[Battle of Hokuetsu]] ([[Boshin War]]) by Utagawa Kuniteru II]]

[[File:Nagaoka jouka nenju gyouji zue - Nenshi tojo.jpg|200px|thumb|Picture of annual event of the Nagaoka castle – going into the castle for New Year greeting]]

The area of present-day Nagaoka was part of ancient [[Echigo Province]]. Under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], a [[jōkamachi|castle town]] was constructed by [[Hori Naoyori]] lord of [[Nagaoka Domain]] in 1616.  However, as the initial castle was located in an area prone to flooding by the [[Shinano River]], a new castle was built at the site of present-day [[Nagaoka Station]] in 1617. Nagaoka flourished as under the reign of the 13 generations of the [[Makino clan]] during the [[Edo period]]. In the [[Boshin War]] of 1868 during the [[Meiji Restoration]], Nagaoka Domain was a member of the [[Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei]] against the imperial forces, and the city was reduced to rubble during the [[Battle of Hokuetsu]]. A gift of one hundred sacks of rice from a neighboring province was sold to finance a new school during the reconstruction of Nagaoka, from which the anecdote of ''[[Kome Hyappyo]]'' was born.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

With the Meiji period creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889, the towns of Nagaoka and Nagaoka-honmachi were established. The two towns were merged on November 1, 1901 with the towns of Senju, Kusouzu, Ara, and village of Ouchi to form the modern town of Nagaoka, which was then raised to city status on April 1, 1906.
