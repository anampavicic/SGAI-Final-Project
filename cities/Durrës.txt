It is one of Albania's oldest [[list of oldest continuously inhabited cities|continuously inhabited cities]],{{sfn|Sedlar|2013|p=111}} with roughly 2,500 years of [[recorded history]]. It is located on a flat plain along the [[Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast]] between the mouths of the [[Erzen River|Erzen]] and [[Ishëm (river)|Ishëm]] at the southeastern corner of the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Durrës' climate is profoundly influenced by a seasonal [[Mediterranean climate]].

Durrës was founded under the name of [[Epidamnos]] around the 7th century BC, by [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] colonists from [[Corinth]] and [[Korkyra (polis)|Corcyra]] in cooperation with the [[Taulantii]], a local [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribe.<ref name="Grote2013"/><ref>{{harvnb|Stallo|2007|p=29}}.</ref> Also known as Dyrrachium, Durrës essentially developed as it became an integral part of the [[Roman Empire]] and its successor the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The [[Via Egnatia]] started in the city and led east across the fields, lowlands and highlands of the Balkan Peninsula to [[Constantinople]].

In the [[Middle Ages]], Durrës was contested between [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]], [[Venetian Empire|Venetians]], [[Albanian principalities|local Albanian noble families]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] dominion. The Ottomans ultimately prevailed, ruling the city for more than 400 years from 1501 until 1912. Following the [[Albanian Declaration of Independence]], the city served as the capital of the [[Principality of Albania]] for a short period of time. Subsequently, it was annexed by the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in the [[interwar period]] and was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] during World War II. Durrës experienced a strong expansion in its demography and economic activity under the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]].

The transport connections, concentration of economic institutions and industrial tradition underlie Durrës' leading economic position in Albania. It is served by the [[Port of Durrës]], one of the largest on the Adriatic Sea, which connects the city to other neighbouring countries. Its most considerable attraction is the [[Durrës Amphitheatre|Amphitheatre of Durrës]] that is included on the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Albania#Tentative list|Albanian tentative list]] for designation as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Once having a capacity for 20,000 people, it is the largest amphitheatre in the [[List of Roman amphitheatres|Balkan Peninsula]].

== Name ==

In antiquity, the city was known as {{lang|grc-Latn|Epidamnos}} ({{lang|grc|Ἐπίδαμνος}}) and {{lang|grc-Latn|Dyrrhachion}} ({{lang|grc|Δυρράχιον}}) in [[Ancient Greek|classical Greek]] and then {{lang|la|Epidamnus}} and {{lang|la|Dyrrachium}} in [[classical Latin]]. ''Epidamnos'' is the older known of the two toponyms; it is widely considered to be of [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]] origin, as first proposed by linguist [[Hans Krahe]],{{sfn|Shehi|2017|p=108}} and is attested in [[Thucydides]] (5th century BC), [[Aristotle]] (4th century BC), and [[Polybius]] (2nd century BC).{{sfn|Demiraj|2006|p=126}} Etymologically, ''Epidamnos'' may be related to [[Proto-Albanian language|Proto-Albanian]] *dami (cub, young animal, young bull) > dem (modern Albanian) as proposed by linguist [[Eqrem Çabej]].{{sfn|Demiraj|1997|pp=128–29}} Although the name ''Epidamnos/Epidamnus'' was more commonly used among Ancient Greek authors, the coinage of the city only used the abbreviations for the name ''Dyrrhachion/Dyrrhachium''.<ref>{{harvnb|Cabanes|2008|pp=166, 169}}</ref> ''Dyrrachium'' was chosen as the sole name of the city after the [[Roman Republic]] got control of the region after the [[Illyrian Wars]] in 229 BC.{{sfn|Demiraj|2006|p=126}} The Latin spelling of /y/ retained the form of [[Doric Greek]] Dyrrhachion, which was pronounced as /Durrakhion/. This change of the name is already attested in classical literature. Titus Livius, at the end of the first century BC, writes in [[Ab Urbe Condita Libri]] that at the time of the Illyrian Wars (roughly 200 years earlier) the city was not known as Dyrrachium, but as Epidamnus. [[Pomponius Mela]], about 70 years later than Titus Livius, attributed the change of the name to the fact that the name Epidamnos reminded the Romans of the Latin word {{lang|la|damnum}}, which signified evil and bad luck; [[Pliny the Elder]], who lived in the same period, repeated this explanation in his own works. However, the Romans may have adopted the new name because it was already in more frequent use by citizens of the city.{{sfn|Demiraj|2006|p=127}}

The name ''Dyrrhachion'' is usually explained as a Greek compound from {{lang|grc|δυσ-}} 'bad' and {{lang|grc|ῥαχία}} 'rocky shore, flood, roaring waves',<ref>{{cite journal |first=Hans |last=Krahe |title=Vom Illyrischen zum Alteuropäischen |journal=Indogermanische Forschungen |volume=69 |year=1964 |page=202}}</ref> an explanation already hinted at in antiquity by Cassius Dio, who writes it referred to the difficulties of the rocky coastline,<ref>{{cite book |first=Cassius |last=Dio |title=Roman History |chapter=41:49 |publisher=Loeb Classical Library |year=1916 |volume=IV |page=85 |url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/41*.html#note12 |access-date=19 February 2021 |archive-date=20 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240120172244/https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/41%2A.html#note12 |url-status=live }}</ref> while also reporting that other Roman authors linked it to the name of an [[eponymous]] hero ''Dyrrachius''. The mythological construction of the city's name was recorded by [[Appian]] (2nd century AD) who wrote that "the king of the barbarians of this country, Epidamnus gave the name to the city. His daughter's son Dyrrachius, built a port near the town that he called Dyrrachium". [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] repeated this mythological construction in his work. It is unclear whether the two toponyms referred originally to different areas of the territory of the city or whether they referred to the same territory.{{sfn|Demiraj|2006|p=128}} Classical literature indicates that they more probably referred to different neighbouring areas originally. Gradually, the name Epidamnus fell out of use and Dyrrachium became the sole name for the city.{{sfn|Demiraj|2006|p=129}}
Archaeological research has shown that at the time of the foundation of Durrës, two distinct settlements existed on its territory. The first one is a hill site with no direct contact with the sea. It predates the colony and might represent the settlement which held the toponym known as ''Epidamnos'' in ancient literature. The hill site overlooks to its south the second site which is the territory of the port of Durrës, where the colony was founded. Its location on a rocky shore struck by waves on all sides reflects the description of the toponym Dyrrhachion.{{sfn|Shehi|2017|p=110}} The distinction between these two districts of the city remained in place even much later. In the 19th century, ''Durrës proper'' was the district of the port, while the hill north of it was a separate settlement, Stani (Kodra e Stanit).{{sfn|Shehi|2017|p=107}}

The modern names of the city in Albanian ({{lang|sq|Durrës}}) and Italian ({{lang|it|Durazzo}}, {{IPA|it|duˈrattso}}) are derived from ''Dyrrachium''/''Dyrrachion''. An intermediate, [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalized]] antecedent is found in the form ''Dyrratio'', attested in the early centuries AD. The palatalized /-tio/ ending probably represents a phonetic change in the way the inhabitants of the city pronounced its name.<ref name="Demiraj133">{{harvnb|Demiraj|2006|pp=133–34}}</ref> The preservation of old Doric /u/ indicates that the modern name derives from populations to whom the toponym was known in its original Doric pronunciation.{{sfn|Demiraj|2006|p=132}} By contrast, in Byzantine Greek, the name of the city is pronounced with the much later evolution of /u/ as /i/. The modern Italian name evolved in the sub-dialects that emerged from [[Colloquial Latin]] in northern Italy.<ref>{{cite book |first=Guillaume |last=Bonnet |title=Les mots latins de l'albanais |location=Paris |publisher=[[L'Harmattan]] |year=1998 |page=37 |language=fr}}</ref> The modern Albanian name evolved independently from the parent language of Albanian around the same period of the post-Roman era in the first centuries AD as the difference in [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] in the two toponyms (first syllable in Albanian, second in Italian) highlights.<ref name="Demiraj133"/> In [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], the city is known as {{lang|rup|Durus}}.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://issuu.com/leogjata/docs/arumunet_albania_nr_40 |title=Arumunët Albania, nr. 40 |newspaper=Arumunët Albania |issue=40 |page=15 |year=2014 |language=sq, rup |access-date=29 August 2022 |archive-date=29 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220829121218/https://issuu.com/leogjata/docs/arumunet_albania_nr_40 |url-status=live }}</ref> During the 411-year [[Ottoman Albania|Ottoman period]], Durrës was known in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] as ''Dırac'' (دراج); with [[final consonant devoicing]], the name has evolved into modern [[Turkish language|Turkish]] as ''Dıraç''.<ref>{{cite document |first=Tahir |last=Sezen |title=Osmanlı Yer Adları (Ottoman Place Names) |location=Ankara |publisher=[[Directorate of State Archives]] |year=2017 |page=217 |language=tr}}</ref> In [[Venetian language|Venetian]] it called ''Durazo'',<ref>https://www.swaen.com/listing/durazo-view-of-durres-in-albania/40924</ref> while in the [[South Slavic languages]] the city is known as ''Drač'' (Cyrillic Драч).<ref name="brit1">https://www.britannica.com/place/Durres</ref>

== History ==

=== Earliest period ===

The territory of Durrës was populated at least starting from the [[Eneolithic]] and then, from [[Protohistory|protohistoric]] times, it was inhabited by Illyrian peoples.<ref>{{harvnb|Sassi|2018|p=942}}</ref>

=== Antiquity ===

Though surviving remains are minimal,<ref>A selection of modern travelers' accounts and references in ancient literature are given in P. Cabanes and F. Drini, eds, ''Inscription d'Épidamne-Dyrrhachion et d'Apollonia'', vol. I (1995)</ref> Durrës is one of the oldest cities in Albania. In terms of mythology, the genealogy of the foundation of Dyrrhachium includes among the founders Illyrian men (the Illyrian king Epidamnos and his grandson Dyrrachos), Greek men (the [[Ancient Corinth|Corinthian]] Falio, descendant of Heracles), heroes ([[Heracles]] who was given part of the lands) and gods ([[Poseidon]], as father of Dyrrachos).{{sfn|Sassi|2018|pp=951–952}}<ref>{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=111}}</ref>

Several ancient people held the site: the presence of the [[Brygi]] appears to be confirmed by several ancient writers, the [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] [[Taulantii]] (their arrival has been estimated to have happened not later than the 10th century BC), probably the [[Liburni]] who expanded southwards in the 9th century BC.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Boardman |first1=John |last2=Edwards |first2=I.

After 323 BC Epidamnus-Dyrrhachium was involved in the intervention in Illyria of the Macedonians under [[Cassander]], who clashed with the Illyrians under [[Glaukias]]. In 314 BC the Macedonian king seized the city but the garrison he established there was in turn besieged and driven out by the Illyrian king and the [[Korkyra (polis)|Corcyrans]]. In 312 BC, after another unsuccessful attack of Cassander in the region, the city came under the protection of Glaukias.

[[File:07Durres01.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance in the [[ancient walls of Durrës]]]]

For [[Catullus]], the city was ''Durrachium Hadriae tabernam'', "the ''[[taberna]]'' of the Adriatic", one of the stopping places for a Roman traveling up the [[Adriatic]], as Catullus had done himself in the sailing season of 56.<ref>M. Gwyn Morgan, "Catullus and the 'Annales Volusi'" ''Quaderni Urbinati di Cultura Classica'', New Series, '''4''' (1980):59–67).</ref>

After the [[Illyrian Wars]] with the [[Roman Republic]] in 229 BC ended in a decisive defeat for the Illyrians, the city passed to Roman rule, under which it was developed as a major military and naval base. The Romans preferred to use the name ''Dyrrachium'' (Greek: Δυρράχιον / ''Dyrrhachion'') for the city. They considered the name ''Epidamnos'' to be inauspicious because of its wholly coincidental similarities with the Latin word ''damnum'', meaning "loss" or "harm". The meaning of ''Dyrrachium'' ("bad spine" or "difficult ridge" in Greek) is unclear, but it has been suggested that it refers to the imposing cliffs near the city. During the [[Great Roman Civil War]] in Illyria, the [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (48 BC)|Battle of Dyrrachium]] was undertaken by [[Julius Caesar]] against [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompey]]. The battle was a victory for Pompey, but it preceded the more decisive [[Battle of Pharsalus]] in Greece where Caesar won. Under Roman rule, Dyrrachium prospered; it became the western end of the ''[[Via Egnatia]]'', the great [[Roman road]] that led to [[Thessalonica]] and on to [[Constantinople]]. Another lesser road led south to the city of ''Buthrotum'', the modern [[Butrint]]. The Roman emperor [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]] made the city a colony for veterans of his [[Roman legion|legions]] following the [[Battle of Actium]], proclaiming it a ''[[civitas libera]]'' (free town).

In the 4th century, Dyrrachium was made the capital of the [[Roman province]] of [[Epirus nova]]. It was the birthplace of the emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] in {{circa|430}}. Sometime later that century, Dyrrachium was struck by a powerful earthquake which destroyed the city's defences. Anastasius I rebuilt and strengthened the city walls, thus creating the strongest fortifications in the western Balkans. The {{convert|12|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off|-high}} walls were so thick that, according to the Byzantine historian [[Anna Komnene]], four horsemen could ride abreast on them. Significant portions of the ancient city defences still remain, although they have been much reduced over the centuries.

Like much of the rest of the [[Balkans]], Dyrrachium and the surrounding ''Dyrraciensis provinciae'' suffered considerably from [[barbarian]] incursions during the [[Migrations Period]]. It was besieged in 481 by [[Theodoric the Great]], king of the [[Ostrogoth]]s, and in subsequent centuries had to fend off frequent attacks by the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]]. Unaffected by the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], the city continued under the [[Byzantine Empire]] as an important port and a major link between the Empire and western Europe. During the sixth century based on accounts of [[Procopius]], the city was mainly inhabited by a Greek population.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Winnifrith |first1=Tom |title=Badlands, Borderlands: A History of Northern Epirus/Southern Albania |year=2002 |publisher=Duckworth |isbn=978-0-7156-3201-7 |page=169 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dkRoAAAAMAAJ |access-date=2 November 2020 |language=en |quote=But there is no reason to disbelieve Justinian's historian Procopius when he says that in the sixth century Epirus as far as Dyrrachium was Greek . |archive-date=3 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230203111216/https://books.google.com/books?id=dkRoAAAAMAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The city and the surrounding coast became a Byzantine province, the [[Theme of Dyrrhachium]], probably in the first decade of the 9th century.{{sfn|ODB|loc="Dyrrachion" (T. E. Gregory), p. 668}} Durrës became a [[Christianity|Christian]] city quite early on; its [[Diocese|bishopric]] was created around 58 and was raised to the status of an [[archbishopric]] in 449. It was also the seat of an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[metropolitan bishop]]. The city remained in Byzantine hands until the late 10th century, when control passed to [[Samuel of Bulgaria]], possibly through his marriage with [[Agatha, wife of Samuel of Bulgaria|Agatha]], daughter of the local magnate [[John Chryselios]]. Samuel made his son-in-law [[Ashot Taronites]], a Byzantine captive who had married his daughter [[Miroslava of Bulgaria|Miroslava]], governor of Durrës. In circa 1005, however, Ashot and Miroslava, with the connivance of Chryselios, fled to [[Constantinople]], where they notified Emperor [[Basil II]] of their intention to surrender the city to him. Soon a Byzantine squadron under [[Eustathios Daphnomeles]] arrived at Durrës, and the city returned to Byzantine rule.{{sfn|Stephenson|2003|pp=17–18, 34–35}}{{sfn|Holmes|2005|pp=103–104, 497–498}}

}}

In the 11th–12th centuries, the city was important as a military stronghold and a [[metropolitan see]] rather than as a major economic center, and never recovered its late antique prosperity; [[Anna Komnene]] makes clear that medieval Dyrrhachium occupied only a portion of the ancient city.{{sfn|ODB|loc="Dyrrachion" (T. E. Gregory), p. 668}} In the 1070s, two of its governors, [[Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder]] and [[Nikephoros Basilakes]], led unsuccessful rebellions trying to seize the Byzantine throne.{{sfn|ODB|loc="Dyrrachion" (T. E. Gregory), p. 668}} Dyrrachium was lost in February 1082 when [[Alexios I Komnenos]] was defeated by the [[Normans]] under [[Robert Guiscard]] and his son [[Bohemund I of Antioch|Bohemund]] in the [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)|Battle of Dyrrhachium]]. Byzantine control was restored a few years later, but the Normans under Bohemund returned to besiege it in 1107–08, and sacked it again in 1185 under King [[William II of Sicily]].{{sfn|ODB|loc="Dyrrachion" (T. E. Gregory), p. 668}}

In 1205, after the [[Fourth Crusade]], the city was transferred to the rule of the [[Republic of Venice]], which formed the "[[Duchy of Durazzo (Republic of Venice)|Duchy of Durazzo]]". This Duchy was conquered in 1213 and the city taken by the [[Despotate of Epirus]] under [[Michael I Komnenos Doukas]]. In 1257, Durrës was briefly occupied by the King of Sicily, [[Manfred of Sicily|Manfred of Hohenstaufen]]. It was re-occupied by the Despot of Epirus [[Michael II Komnenos Doukas]] until 1259, when the Despotate was defeated by the Byzantine [[Empire of Nicaea]] in the [[Battle of Pelagonia]]. In the 1270s, Durrës was again controlled by Epirus under [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas]], the son of Michael II, who in 1278 was forced to yield the city to Charles d' Anjou ([[Charles I of Sicily]]). In {{circa|1273}}, it was wrecked by a devastating [[earthquake]] (according to [[George Pachymeres]]<ref>R. Elsie, ''Early Albania'' (2003), p.&nbsp;12</ref>) but soon recovered. It was briefly occupied by King [[Stephen Uroš II Milutin of Serbia|Milutin]] of Serbia in 1296. In the thirteenth century, a [[Jews in Albania|Jewish community]] existed in Durrës and was employed in the [[salt trade]].<ref name="Giakoumis9596"/>

In the early 14th century, the city was ruled by a coalition of Anjous, Hungarians, and Albanians of the Thopia family. In 1317 or 1318, the area was taken by the Serbs and remained under their rule until the 1350s. At that time the Popes, supported by the Anjous, increased their diplomatic and political activity in the area, by using the Latin bishops, including the archbishop of Durrës. The city had been a religious center of Catholicism after the Anjou were installed in Durrës. In 1272, a Catholic archbishop was installed, and until the mid-14th century there were both Catholic and Orthodox archbishops of Durrës.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2009/mphlae01.pdf |title=Etleva Lala (2008) Regnum Albaniae, the Papal Curia, and the Western Visions of a Borderline Nobility |access-date=29 May 2011 |archive-date=9 October 2022 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2009/mphlae01.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

Two Irish pilgrims who visited Albania on their way to Jerusalem in 1322, reported that Durrës was "inhabited by Latins, Greeks, perfidious Jews and barbaric Albanians".<ref>''Itinerarium Symonis Simeonis et Hugonis Illuminatoris ad Terram Sanctam'', edited by J. Nasmith, 1778, cited in: Elsie Robert, ''The earliest references to the existence of the Albanian language''. Zeitschrift für Balkanologie, Munich, 1991, v. 27.2, pp.&nbsp;101–105.

Elsie: "For it is inhabited by Latins, Greeks, perfidious Jews and barbaric Albanians").</ref>

When the Serbian Tsar [[Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia|Dušan]] died in 1355, the city passed into the hands of the Albanian family of [[Thopia family|Thopias]]. In 1376 the [[Navarrese Company]] [[Louis of Évreux, Duke of Durazzo]], who had gained the rights on the [[Kingdom of Albania (medieval)|Kingdom of Albania]] from his second wife, attacked and conquered the city, but in 1383 [[Karl Topia]] regained control of the city.<ref>Fine (1994), p. 384</ref> The [[Republic of Venice]] regained control in 1392 and retained the city, known as ''Durazzo'' in those years, as part of the ''[[Albania Veneta]]''. It fended off a siege by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Mehmed II]] in 1466 but fell to Ottoman forces in 1501.

Under Ottoman rule, many of its inhabitants converted to [[Islam]] and many [[mosque]]s were erected. The city was renamed Dırac (دراج) but did not prosper in the first two centuries of the Ottoman era; its importance declined greatly and it became a den of [[piracy]]. Following the establishment of Ottoman rule in 1501, the Durrës Jewish community experienced population growth.<ref name="Giakoumis9596">{{cite book |last=Giakoumis |first=Konstantinos |chapter=The Orthodox Church in Albania Under the Ottoman Rule 15th–19th Century |editor1-last=Schmitt |editor1-first=Oliver Jens |title=Religion und Kultur im albanischsprachigen Südosteuropa &#91;Religion and culture in Albanian-speaking southeastern Europe&#93; |year=2010 |location=Frankfurt am Main |publisher=Peter Lang |isbn=9783631602959 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aCdYHU9PtiIC&q=Durr%C3%ABs |pages=95–96 |access-date=17 October 2020 |archive-date=20 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240120172122/https://books.google.com/books?id=aCdYHU9PtiIC&q=Durr%C3%ABs#v=snippet&q=Durr%C3%ABs&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Albania - Rosaccio Giuseppe - 1598.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the coast in northern Durrës from Giuseppe Rosaccio in 1598]]

As a port, Durrës was of little importance to the Ottomans, who controlled the entire Albanian coast. The town's main significance rather lay in [[Durrës Castle|its strategic castle]], which the Turks reinforced and improved upon, and its rich salt deposits. There were few permanent civilian settlements, and most of the population, including the local [[kadı]], opted to live further inland, such as in the newly established town of [[Kavajë]], 14&nbsp;km south of Durrës. The Ottoman chronicler [[Evliya Çelebi]] visited Durrës in 1670-71 and noted in his ''[[Seyahatname]]'' that there were around 150 houses as well as a mosque named after Sultan [[Bayezid II]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Çelebi |first=Evliya |title=Seyhahatname, Vol. VIII}}</ref>

The city's economy began to recover from the late 17th century onwards, boosted by profits from the salt mines, which exported salt throughout the Balkan hinterland. According to diplomat and Turkologist [[François Pouqueville]], about 100 Turkish and Greek merchants lived in the city in 1699, exporting 3,000 [[quintal]]s (300 tons) of beeswax, 15,000 quintals (1,500 tons) of finished cloth, 15,000 pieces of fine leather, and 60-100 ships of wheat, barley, corn and millet to Venice every year despite an official prohibition from the central government in Constantinople.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pouqueville |first=François Charles Hugues Laurent |title=Voyage de la Grèce |year=1826 |location=Paris}}</ref> France, England, the Netherlands, and Austria established their consulates in Durrës in 1700.

As Ottoman relations with Venice improved upon the conclusion of the [[Ottoman-Venetian Wars]], Durrës became a focal point of trade with the Republic of Venice, especially in grains and olive oil, as reported by the Venetian consul in the city in 1769. Mercantile relations with Venice were halted when the latter city was occupied by Napoleonic forces in 1797, bringing an end to the maritime republic. The [[Austrian Empire]] and later [[Austria-Hungary]], via the port of [[Trieste]], then replaced Venice as Durrës' largest trading partner. According to contemporary statistician [[:de:Friedrich Wilhelm von Reden (Statistiker)|Friedrich Wilhelm von Reden]], total exports from Durrës reached 672,000 Austrian [[thaler]]s each year, while imports amounted to 455,000 thalers.<ref>{{cite book |last=von Reden |first=Friedrich Wilhelm |title=Die Türkei und Griechenland etc. |page=259 |year=1856 |location=Frankfurt}}</ref>

By the mid-19th century, its population was said to have been about 1,000 people living in some 200 households. In the late nineteenth century, Durrës contained 1,200 Orthodox [[Aromanians]] (130 families) who lived among the larger population of Muslim Albanians alongside a significant number of Catholic Albanians.<ref name="Koukoudis358">{{cite book |last=Koukoudis |first=Asterios |title=The Vlachs: Metropolis and Diaspora |year=2003 |location=Thessaloniki |publisher=Zitros Publications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=01JoAAAAMAAJ&q=Berat |isbn=9789607760869 |pages=358 |access-date=17 October 2020 |archive-date=20 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240120172149/https://books.google.com/books?id=01JoAAAAMAAJ&q=Berat |url-status=live }} "Durrës... At the end of the nineteenth century, there were more than 130 Vlach families, some 1,200 Vlachs, who constituted the nucleus of the local Greek Orthodox community, amid the much more numerous Moslem Albanians and quite a number of Roman Catholics, also of Albanian stock."</ref> The decrepitude of Durrës was noted by foreign observers in the early 20th century, echoing comments made by the Ottoman cartographer [[Piri Reis]] almost 400 years before: "The walls are dilapidated; plane-trees grow on the gigantic ruins of its old Byzantine citadel; and its harbour, once equally commodious and safe, is gradually becoming silted up."<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Durazzo |volume=8 |page=695}}</ref>

[[File:Duress Purger 13958.jpg|thumb|Turn-of-the-century Durrës, in the last decades of Ottoman rule]]

During the [[Tanzimat]] (reform) era, Durrës was separated from the [[Sanjak of Elbasan]] and became a main administrative centre in the reorganised [[Scutari Province, Ottoman Empire|İşkodra Vilayet]] before 1912; it had its own [[sanjak]], namely the [[Sanjak of Durrës]], which was established in 1880 within the vilayet. With the city's economic prosperity and upgrade in status, its demographic decline was also reversed. Many government buildings were built, as well as Western-style hotels and restaurants for private businesses. In 1892-1893 the population of the [[kaza]] of Durrës grew to about 4,781, consisting of 3,018 Muslims, 1,514 Orthodox, 201 Catholics, and 48 foreigners.

On 26 November 1912, as the Ottoman Empire was embroiled in the [[First Balkan War]], a group of nationalists led by [[Ismail Qemali]] raised the [[Albanian flag]] over Durrës. [[Albanian Declaration of Independence|Albania declared independence]] two days later, bringing four centuries of Turkish rule in Durrës to an end.

Durrës was an active city in the [[Albanian National Awakening|Albanian national liberation movement]] in the periods 1878–1881 and 1910–1912. [[Ismail Qemali]] raised the [[Flag of Albania|Albanian flag]] on 26 November 1912 but the city was occupied by the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] three days later during the [[First Balkan War]]. On 29 November 1912 Durrës became the county town of the [[Durrës County (Kingdom of Serbia)|Durrës County]] one of the counties of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] established on the part of the territory of [[Albania (toponym)|Albania]] occupied from [[Ottoman Empire]].

During the [[First World War]], the city was occupied by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] in 1915 and by [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1916–1918. On 29 December 1915, [[Battle of Durazzo (1915)|a Naval Battle]] was fought off Durazzo. On 2 October 1918, several allied ships [[Battle of Durazzo (1918)#Battle|bombarded Durazzo]] and attacked the few Austrian ships in the harbour. Although civilians started to flee the city at the start of the bombardment, many casualties were inflicted on the innocent and neutral population. The Old City being adjacent to the harbour was largely destroyed, including the [[Royal Palace of Durrës]] and other primary public buildings. It was captured by Italian troops on 16 October 1918. Restored to Albanian sovereignty, Durrës became the country's temporary capital between 1918 and March 1920. It experienced an economic boom due to Italian investments and developed into a major seaport under the rule of King [[Zog of Albania|Zog]], with a modern harbour being constructed in 1927. It was at this time the [[Royal Villa of Durrës]] was built by Zog as a summer palace, that still dominates the skyline from a hill close to the old city.

[[File:Royal villa of Durres 01.jpg|thumb|Royal villa in Durrës]]

An earthquake in 1926 damaged some of the city and the rebuilding that followed gave the city its more modern appearance. During the 1930s, the [[Bank of Athens]] had a branch in the city. <!-- Commented out: [[File:Durazzo, Albania, April 1939, Italian soldiers entering the city.jpg|thumb|[[Italian invasion of Albania|Italian soldiers]] entering the city on 7 April 1939 after facing fierce resistance from [[Mujo Ulqinaku]] and the [[Royal Albanian Army]].]] -->

Durrës (called ''Durazzo'' again in Italian) and the rest of Albania were [[Italian invasion of Albania|occupied in April 1939]] and annexed to the [[Kingdom of Italy]] until 1943, then occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] until [[Belgrade Offensive|autumn 1944]]. Durrës's strategic value as a seaport made it a high-profile military target for both sides. It was the site of the [[Italian invasion of Albania|initial Italian landings]] on 7 April 1939 (and was fiercely defended by [[Mujo Ulqinaku]]) as well as the launch point for the ill-fated [[Greco-Italian War|Italian invasion of Greece]]. The city was heavily damaged by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing during the war and the port installations were blown up by retreating German soldiers in autumn 1944.

[[File:Soldier statue Durres.jpg|thumb|240x240px|Socialist realist statue of unknown soldier with a high rise in the background]]

The [[Communist]] regime of [[Enver Hoxha]] rapidly rebuilt the city following the war, establishing a variety of heavy industries in the area and expanding the port. It became the terminus of Albania's first [[railway]], begun in 1947 ([[Durrës–Tiranë railway]]). In the late 1980s, the city was briefly renamed Durrës-Enver Hoxha. The city was and continues to remain the center of Albanian mass beach tourism.

Following the collapse of communist rule in 1990, Durrës became the focus of mass emigrations from Albania with ships being hijacked in the harbour and sailed at gunpoint to Italy. In one month alone, August 1991, over 20,000 people migrated to Italy in this fashion. Italy intervened militarily, putting the port area under its control, and the city became the center of the [[European Community]]'s "[[Operation Pelican (EU food aid program)|Operation Pelican]]", a food-aid program.

In 1997, [[1997 Albanian civil unrest|Albania slid into anarchy]] following the collapse of a massive [[pyramid scheme]] which devastated the national economy. An Italian-led peacekeeping force was controversially deployed to Durrës and other Albanian cities to restore order, although there were widespread suggestions that the real purpose of "[[Operation Alba]]" was to prevent economic refugees continuing to use Albania's ports as a route to migrate to Italy.

Following the start of the 21st century, Durrës has been revitalized as many streets were repaved, while parks and façades experienced a face lift.

[[File:Panorama of Durres Port.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Its highly advantageous geographical location puts the [[Port of Durrës]] among the largest in the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]] seas.]]

Durrës is an important link to [[Western Europe]] due to its port and its proximity to the Italian port cities, notably Bari, to which daily ferries run. As well as the dockyard, it also possesses an important shipyard and manufacturing industries, notably producing leather, plastic and tobacco products.

The southern coastal stretch of Golem is renowned for its traditional mass beach tourism having experienced uncontrolled urban development. The city's beaches are also a popular destination for many foreign and local tourists. In 2012, new water sanitation systems are being installed to eliminate sea water pollution. In contrast, the northern coastal stretch of Lalzit Bay is mostly unspoiled and set to become an elite tourism destination as a number of beach resorts are being built since 2009. Neighboring districts are known for the production of good wine and a variety of foodstuffs.

According to the World Bank, Durrës has made significant steps of starting a business in 2016. Durrës ranks ninth<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/Rankings/south-east-europe |title=Subnational Economy Rankings – South East Europe – Subnational Doing Business – World Bank Group |work=doingbusiness.org |access-date=7 November 2016 |archive-date=2 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002101308/http://www.doingbusiness.org/Rankings/south-east-europe |url-status=live }}</ref> among 22 cities in [[Southeastern Europe]] before the capital [[Tirana]], [[Belgrade]], Serbia and [[Sarajevo]], Bosnia and Herzegovina.

=== Transportation ===
[[File:Tirana%27s_Overpass_From_Durres_(1).JPG|thumb|[[National Road 2 (Albania)|SH2]] between [[Tirana]] and Durrës]]
[[File:Highway_at_K%C3%ABmbi_i_kavaj%C3%ABs_(OSCAL19_trip).jpg|thumb|SH4 at Kavaja Rock along Golem beach resort area]]

Major roads and railways pass through the city of Durrës thank to its significant location and connect the northern part of the country to the south and the west with the east. Durrës is the starting point of [[Pan-European Corridor VIII]], national roads SH2 and SH4, and serves as the [[main railway station]] of the [[Hekurudha Shqiptare|Albanian Railways]] (HSH).

The [[Pan-European Corridor VIII]] is one of the [[Pan-European corridor]]s. It runs between Durrës, at the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast, and [[Varna, Bulgaria|Varna]], at the [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast|Bulgarian Black Sea coast]]. The [[National Road 2 (Albania)|National Road 2]] (SH2) begins at the [[Port of Durrës]] at the Dajlani Overpass, bypasses the road to [[Tirana International Airport]], and ends at the Kamza Overpass in the outskirts of [[Tirana]] where it meets [[National Road 1 (Albania)|National Road 1]] (SH1) State Road heading to northern Albania. The [[Albania–Kosovo Highway]] is a four-lane highway constructed from 2006 to 2013 between Albania and Kosovo. As part of the South-East European Route 7,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/projects-in-focus/donor-coordination/2-3_april_2009/working_group_transport_seeto_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-10-13 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304214850/http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/projects-in-focus/donor-coordination/2-3_april_2009/working_group_transport_seeto_en.pdf |url-status=dead}}</ref> the highway will connect the [[Adriatic Sea]] ports of Durrës via Pristina, with the [[Pan-European corridor X|E75/Corridor X]] near [[Niš]], Serbia. As most tourists come through Kosovo, the laying of the highway make it easier to travel to Durrës.

The [[Port of Durrës]], in the south-west of the city, is one of the major ports of the Adriatic Sea and plays a very important role in the city's economy. The port is located on an artificial basin that is formed between two moles, with a west-northwesterly oriented entrance approximately wide as it passes between the ends of the moles. The port is also a key location for transit networks and passenger ferry, giving Durrës a strategic position with respect to the [[Pan-European Corridor VIII]]. The port has experienced major upgrades in recent years culminating with the opening of the new terminal in July 2012.
In 2012, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' ranked Durrës at no. 1 among 8 exciting new cruise ports to explore.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/travel/vacations/cruise/8-exciting-new-cruise-ports-to-explore/article2348986/ 8 exciting new cruise ports to explore] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428015610/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/travel/vacations/cruise/8-exciting-new-cruise-ports-to-explore/article2348986/ |date=28 April 2012 }}, The Globe and Mail, 2012-02-24</ref> It is one of the largest passenger port on the [[Adriatic Sea]] that handle more than 1.5 million passengers per year.

The [[Durrës railway station|railway station of Durrës]] is connected to other cities in Albania, including the capital of [[Tirana]], [[Vlorë]], [[Elbasan]] and [[Shkodër]]. The [[Durrës–Tiranë railway]] was a {{convert|38|km|adj=on|abbr=off}} [[Rail transport|railway]] line which joined the two biggest cities in [[Albania]]: Durrës and [[Tiranë]]. The line connects to the [[Shkodër–Vorë railway]] halfway in [[Vorë]], and to the [[Durrës–Vlorë railway]] in Durrës. In 2015, some rail stations and rolling stock along the Durrës-Tiranë line are being upgraded and latter colored red and white.

A rail connection between Durrës and [[Prishtina]] in Kosovo was proposed in 2021, with a feasibility study being prepared in 2022.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kosovo-Albania: Pristina approves a rail link project |url=https://www.agenzianova.com/en/news/kosovo-albania-pristina-approves-a-rail-link-project/ |date=7 July 2022 |access-date=7 August 2023 |archive-date=7 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230807092057/https://www.agenzianova.com/en/news/kosovo-albania-pristina-approves-a-rail-link-project/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The theatrical and musical life of the city is centered on the [[Aleksandër Moisiu Theatre]], the Estrada Theatre, a puppet theatre, and the Philharmonic Orchestra. The annual [[International Film Summerfest of Durrës]], founded in 2008, is held in late August or early September in the amphitheatre.

The city is home to different architectural styles that represent influential periods in its history. The architecture is influenced by Illyrian, Greek, Roman and Italian architecture.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}} In the 21st century, part of Durrës turned into a modernist city, with large blocks of flats, modern new buildings, new shopping centres and many green spaces.

=== Education ===
[[File:Albanian College of Durres.jpg|thumb|The Albanian College of Durrës]]

Durrës has a long tradition of education since the beginning of civil life from antiquity until today. After the fall of communism in Albania, a reorganization plan was announced in 1990, that would extend the compulsory education program from eight to ten years. The following year, major economic and political crisis in Albania, and the ensuing breakdown of public order, plunged the school system into chaos. Later, many schools were rebuilt or reconstructed, to improve learning conditions especially in larger cities of the country. Durrës is host to academic institutions such as the [[University of Durrës]], Albanian College of Durrës, [[Vëllezërit Kajtazi Educational Institute|Kajtazi Brothers Educational Institute]], Gjergj Kastrioti High School, Naim Frashëri High School, sports mastery school Benardina Qerraxhiu and Jani Kukuzeli Artistic Lycee.

One of the city's main sights is the Byzantine city wall, also called [[Durrës Castle]], while the largest [[Durrës Amphitheatre|amphitheatre]] in the Balkans is close to the city's harbour. This fifth-century construction is currently under consideration for listing as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/910/ |title=L'amphithéâtre de Durres |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |work=unesco.org |access-date=26 December 2019 |archive-date=14 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180814170258/https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/910/ |url-status=live }}</ref><!-- Link not working properly: <ref>{{cite web |url=http://img580.imageshack.us/img580/9642/p1060361.jpg |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918145758/http://img580.imageshack.us/img580/9642/p1060361.jpg |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 September 2011 |title=Img580.imageshack.us}}</ref> -->

=== Museums ===

Durrës is home to the largest archaeological museum in the country, the [[Durrës Archaeological Museum]], located near the beach. North of the museum are the sixth-century [[Durrës Castle|Byzantine walls]] constructed after the [[Visigoth]] invasion of 481. The bulk of the museum's collection comprises artefacts from the nearby ancient site of Dyrrhachium and includes an extensive collection from the Illyrian, Ancient Greek, Hellenistic and Roman periods. Items of major note include Roman funeral steles and stone sarcophagi, a colourful elliptical mosaic measuring {{convert|17|x|10|feet|0}}, known as ''[[The Beauty of Durrës]]'', and a collection of miniature busts of Venus, testament to the time when Durrës was a centre of worship of the goddess.
