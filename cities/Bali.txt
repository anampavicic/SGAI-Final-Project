'''Bali''' (<small>English:</small>{{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɑː|l|i}}; {{script/Bali|ᬩᬮᬶ}}) is a [[Provinces of Indonesia|province]] of [[Indonesia]] and the westernmost of the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]. East of [[Java]] and west of [[Lombok]], the province includes the island of Bali and a few smaller offshore islands, notably [[Nusa Penida]], [[Nusa Lembongan]], and [[Nusa Ceningan]] to the southeast. The provincial capital, [[Denpasar]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Denpasar {{!}} Indonesia|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Denpasar|access-date=18 September 2021|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> is the [[List of Indonesian cities by population|most populous city]] in the Lesser Sunda Islands and the second-largest, after [[Makassar]], in [[Eastern Indonesia]].

{{Main|History of Bali}}

=== Ancient ===
{{Main|Bali Kingdom}}
[[File:Bali panorama.jpg|thumb|[[Subak (irrigation)|Subak]] irrigation system|left]]
Bali was inhabited around 2000 BC by [[Austronesian people]] who migrated originally from the island of [[Taiwan]] to Southeast Asia and [[Oceania]] through [[Maritime Southeast Asia]].<ref>[[#Taylor|Taylor]], pp. 5, 7</ref><ref name=Hinzler /> Culturally and linguistically, the Balinese are closely related to the people of the [[Indonesia]]n archipelago, [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Oceania]].<ref name=Hinzler /> Stone tools dating from this time have been found near the village of Cekik in the island's west.<ref>[[#Taylor|Taylor]], p. 12</ref><ref name=Lonely />

In ancient Bali, nine Hindu sects existed, the [[Pashupata Shaivism|Pasupata]], [[Bhairawa]], Siwa Shidanta, [[Vaishnava]], [[Bodha]], [[Brahma]], Resi, Sora and [[Ganapatya]]. Each sect revered a specific deity as its personal Godhead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/04/28/the-birthplace-balinese-hinduism.html |title=The birthplace of Balinese Hinduism |work=The Jakarta Post |date=28 April 2011 |access-date=30 December 2012}}</ref>

Inscriptions from 896 and 911 do not mention a king, until 914, when Sri Kesarivarma is mentioned. They also reveal an independent Bali, with a distinct dialect, where [[Buddhism]] and [[Sivaism|Shaivism]] were practised simultaneously. [[Mpu Sindok]]'s great-granddaughter, [[Mahendradatta]] (Gunapriyadharmapatni), married the Bali king [[Udayana Warmadewa]] (Dharmodayanavarmadeva) around 989, giving birth to [[Airlangga]] around 1001. This marriage also brought more [[Hinduism]] and Javanese culture to Bali. Princess Sakalendukirana appeared in 1098. Suradhipa reigned from 1115 to 1119, and Jayasakti from 1146 until 1150. Jayapangus appears on inscriptions between 1178 and 1181, while Adikuntiketana and his son Paramesvara in 1204.<ref name=indianized>{{Cite book

Balinese culture was strongly influenced by Indian, Chinese, and particularly [[Hindu]] culture, beginning around the 1st century AD. The name ''Bali dwipa'' ("Bali island") has been discovered from various inscriptions, including the Blanjong pillar inscription written by [[Sri Kesari Warmadewa]] in 914 AD and mentioning '''Walidwipa'''. It was during this time that the people developed their complex irrigation system ''[[Subak (irrigation)|subak]]'' to grow rice in [[wet-field cultivation]]. Some religious and cultural traditions still practised today can be traced to this period.

The Hindu-Buddhist [[Majapahit Empire]] (1293–1520 AD) on eastern [[Java (island)|Java]] founded a Balinese colony in 1343. The uncle of [[Hayam Wuruk]] is mentioned in the charters of 1384–86. Mass Javanese immigration to Bali occurred in the next century when the Majapahit Empire fell in 1520.<ref name=indianized />{{rp|234,240}} Bali's government then became an independent collection of Hindu kingdoms which led to a Balinese national identity and major enhancements in culture, arts, and economy. The nation with various kingdoms became independent for up to 386 years until 1906 when the Dutch subjugated and repulsed the natives for economic control and took it over.<ref>[[#Barski|Barski]], p. 46</ref>

=== Portuguese contacts ===
The first known [[European ethnic groups|European]] contact with Bali is thought to have been made in 1512, when a Portuguese expedition led by Antonio Abreu and [[Francisco Serrão]] sighted its northern shores. It was the first expedition of a series of bi-annual fleets to the Moluccas, that throughout the 16th century travelled along the coasts of the Sunda Islands. Bali was also mapped in 1512, in the chart of Francisco Rodrigues, aboard the expedition.<ref>{{cite book

In 1597, the Dutch merchant-explorer [[Cornelis de Houtman]] arrived at Bali, and the [[Dutch East India Company]] was established in 1602. The Dutch government expanded its control across the Indonesian archipelago during the second half of the 19th century. Dutch political and economic control over Bali began in the 1840s on the island's north coast when the Dutch pitted various competing Balinese realms against each other.<ref name="ctpqur" /> In the late 1890s, struggles between Balinese kingdoms on the island's south were exploited by the Dutch to increase their control.

In June 1860, the famous Welsh naturalist, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], travelled to Bali from [[British Singapore|Singapore]], landing at [[Buleleng, Bali|Buleleng]] on the north coast of the island. Wallace's trip to Bali was instrumental in helping him devise his [[Wallace Line]] theory. The Wallace Line is a faunal boundary that runs through the strait between Bali and [[Lombok]]. It is a boundary between species. In his travel memoir ''[[The Malay Archipelago]],'' Wallace wrote of his experience in Bali, which has a strong mention of the [[Subak (irrigation)|unique Balinese irrigation methods]]:

<blockquote>I was astonished and delighted; as my visit to Java was some years later, I had never beheld so beautiful and well-cultivated a district out of Europe. A slightly undulating plain extends from the seacoast about {{convert|10|or|12|mi|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} inland, where it is bounded by a fine range of wooded and cultivated hills. Houses and villages, marked out by dense clumps of [[coconut palms]], [[tamarind]] and other fruit trees, are dotted about in every direction; while between them extend luxurious rice grounds, watered by an elaborate system of irrigation that would be the pride of the best-cultivated parts of Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=The Malay Archipelago|year=1869|isbn=978-0-7946-0563-6|page=116|publisher=Periplus Editions (HK) Limited }}</ref> </blockquote>

The Dutch mounted large naval and ground [[Dutch intervention in Bali (1906)|assaults at the Sanur region]] in 1906 and were met by the thousands of members of the royal family and their followers who rather than yield to the superior Dutch force committed ritual suicide (''[[puputan]]'') to avoid the humiliation of surrender.<ref name="ctpqur" /> Despite Dutch demands for surrender, an estimated 200 Balinese killed themselves rather than surrender.<ref>[[#Haer|Haer]], p. 38.</ref> In the [[Dutch intervention in Bali (1908)|Dutch intervention in Bali]], a similar mass suicide occurred in the face of a Dutch assault in [[Klungkung]]. Afterwards, the Dutch governours exercised administrative control over the island, but local control over religion and culture generally remained intact. Dutch rule over Bali came later and was never as well established as in other parts of Indonesia such as Java and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].

In the 1930s, anthropologists [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Gregory Bateson]], artists [[Miguel Covarrubias]] and [[Walter Spies]], and musicologist [[Colin McPhee]] all spent time here. Their accounts of the island and its peoples created a western image of Bali as "an enchanted land of [[aesthetes]] at peace with themselves and nature". Western tourists began to visit the island.<ref name=Friend>Friend, Theodore. ''Indonesian Destinies'', Harvard University Press, 2003 {{ISBN|0-674-01137-6}}, p. 111.</ref> The sensuous image of Bali was enhanced in the West by a quasi-pornographic 1932 documentary ''Virgins of Bali'' about a day in the lives of two teenage Balinese girls whom the film's narrator Deane Dickason notes in the first scene "bathe their shamelessly nude bronze bodies".<ref name=doherty>Doherty, Thomas ''Pre-Code Hollywood: Sex, Immorality, and Insurrection in American Cinema, 1930–1934'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1999. {{isbn| 0231110952}}</ref>{{rp|134}} Under the looser version of the [[Hays code]] that existed up to 1934, nudity involving "civilised" (i.e. white) women was banned, but permitted with "uncivilised" (i.e. all non-white women), a loophole that was exploited by the producers of ''Virgins of Bali''.<ref name=doherty/>{{rp|133}}  The film, which mostly consisted of scenes of topless Balinese women was a great success in 1932, and almost single-handedly made Bali into a popular spot for tourists.<ref name=doherty/>{{rp|135}}

[[Imperial Japan]] occupied Bali during World War II. It was not originally a target in their Netherlands East Indies Campaign, but as the airfields on [[Borneo]] were inoperative due to heavy rains, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] decided to occupy Bali, which did not suffer from comparable weather. The island had no regular [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) troops. There was only a Native Auxiliary Corps ''Prajoda'' (Korps Prajoda) consisting of about 600 native soldiers and several Dutch KNIL officers under the command of KNIL Lieutenant Colonel W.P. Roodenburg. On 19 February 1942, the Japanese forces landed near the town of Sanoer (Sanur). The island was quickly captured.<ref>{{cite web |author= Klemen, L |url= https://warfare.gq/dutcheastindies/bali.html |title= The Capture of Bali Island, February 1942 |date= 1999–2000 |work= Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941–1942 |access-date= 30 March 2021 |archive-date= 25 March 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120325051425/http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/bali.html |url-status= dead }}</ref>

During the Japanese occupation, a Balinese military officer, [[I Gusti Ngurah Rai]], formed a Balinese 'freedom army'. The harshness of Japanese occupation forces made them more resented than the Dutch colonial rulers.<ref>[[#Haer|Haer]], pp.&nbsp;39–40.</ref>

=== Independence from the Dutch ===
In 1945, Bali was liberated by the British [[5th Infantry Division (India)|5th infantry Division]] under the command of Major-General [[Robert Mansergh]] who took the Japanese surrender. Once Japanese forces had been repatriated the island was handed over to the Dutch the following year.

In 1946, the Dutch constituted Bali as one of the 13 administrative districts of the newly proclaimed [[State of East Indonesia]], a rival state to the Republic of Indonesia, which was proclaimed and headed by [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta|Hatta]]. Bali was included in the "[[Republic of the United States of Indonesia]]" when the Netherlands recognised Indonesian independence on 29 December 1949.<ref>[[#Barski|Barski]], p. 51</ref> The first governor of Bali, [[Anak Agung Bagus Suteja]], was appointed by President Sukarno in 1958, when Bali became a province.<ref>[[#Pringle|Pringle]], p. 167</ref>

The 1963 eruption of [[Mount Agung]] killed thousands, created economic havoc, and forced many displaced Balinese to be [[Transmigration programme|transmigrated]] to other parts of Indonesia. Mirroring the widening of social divisions across Indonesia in the 1950s and early 1960s, Bali saw conflict between supporters of the traditional [[caste system]], and those rejecting this system. Politically, the opposition was represented by supporters of the [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI) and the [[Indonesian Nationalist Party]] (PNI), with tensions and ill-feeling further increased by the PKI's land reform programmes.<ref name="ctpqur" /> [[30 September Movement|A purported coup attempt]] in Jakarta was averted by forces led by General Suharto.

The army became the dominant power as it instigated [[Indonesian killings of 1965–66|a violent anti-communist purge]], in which the army blamed the PKI for the coup. Most estimates suggest that at least 500,000 people were killed across Indonesia, with an estimated 80,000 killed in Bali, equivalent to 5% of the island's population.<ref name="ctpqur" /><ref name=Friend /><ref name=Ricklefs /> With no Islamic forces involved as in Java and Sumatra, upper-caste PNI landlords led the extermination of PKI members.<ref name=Ricklefs />

As a result of the 1965–66 upheavals, Suharto was able to manoeuvre Sukarno [[Transition to the New Order|out of the presidency]]. His [[New Order (Indonesia)|"New Order"]] government re-established relations with Western countries. The pre-War Bali as "paradise" was revived in a modern form. The resulting large growth in tourism has led to a dramatic increase in Balinese standards of living and significant foreign exchange earned for the country.<ref name="ctpqur" />

[[2002 Bali bombings|A bombing in 2002]] by militant [[Islamist]]s in the tourist area of [[Kuta, Bali|Kuta]] killed 202 people, mostly foreigners. This attack, and [[2005 Bali bombings|another in 2005]], severely reduced tourism, producing much economic hardship on the island.

On 27 November 2017, Mount Agung erupted five times, causing the evacuation of thousands, disrupting air travel and causing much environmental damage. [[2017–2019 eruptions of Mount Agung|Further eruptions]] also occurred between 2018 and 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42133502|title=A volcanologist explains Bali eruption photos|date=27 November 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=28 November 2017}}</ref>

The island of Bali lies {{cvt|3.2|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Java (island)|Java]], and is approximately [[8th parallel south|8 degrees south]] of the [[equator]]. Bali and Java are separated by the [[Bali Strait]]. East to west, the island is approximately {{cvt|153|km|mi}} wide and spans approximately {{cvt|112|km|mi}} north to south; administratively it covers {{cvt|5,590.15|km2}}, or {{cvt|5,387.31|km2}} excluding offshore [[Nusa Penida]] District,<ref>{{cite web|title=Kabupaten Klungkung, Data Agregat per Kecamatan|url=http://sp2010.bps.go.id/files/ebook/5105.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004214011/http://sp2010.bps.go.id/files/ebook/5105.pdf |archive-date=4 October 2013 |url-status=live|year=2010|website=Sp2010.bps.go.id}}</ref> which comprises three small islands off the southeast coast of Bali.

[[File:Bali's Gunung Agung seen at sunset from Gunung Rinjani.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Agung]] is the highest point of Bali.]]
Bali's central mountains include several peaks over {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=off}} in elevation and active volcanoes such as [[Mount Batur]]. The highest is [[Mount Agung]] ({{convert|3031|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=semicolon}}), known as the "mother mountain", which is an active [[volcano]] rated as one of the world's most likely sites for a massive eruption within the next 100 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.volcanocafe.org/romantic-paradise-destination-the-new-decade-volcano-program-6-bali/|title=Romantic Paradise Destination – The New Decade Volcano Program #6, Bali|date=10 July 2015}}</ref> In late 2017 [[Mount Agung#2017 seismic activity and eruption|Mount Agung started erupting]] and large numbers of people were evacuated, temporarily closing the island's airport.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-42132912|title=Mount Agung: Bali volcano alert raised to highest level|date=27 November 2017|access-date=8 May 2018|work=BBC News}}</ref> Mountains range from centre to the eastern side, with Mount Agung the easternmost peak. Bali's volcanic nature has contributed to its exceptional fertility and its tall mountain ranges provide the high rainfall that supports the highly productive agriculture sector. South of the mountains is a broad, steadily descending area where most of Bali's large rice crop is grown. The northern side of the mountains slopes more steeply to the sea and is the main coffee-producing area of the island, along with rice, vegetables, and cattle. The longest river, [[Ayung River]], flows approximately {{cvt|75|km|mi}} (see [[List of rivers of Bali]]).

The island is surrounded by [[coral reefs]]. Beaches in the south tend to have white sand while those in the north and west have [[black sand]]. Bali has no major waterways, although the Ho River is navigable by small ''[[sampan]]'' boats. Black sand beaches between Pasut and Klatingdukuh are being developed for tourism, but apart from the seaside temple of [[Tanah Lot]], they are not yet used for significant tourism.

The largest city is the provincial capital, [[Denpasar]], near the southern coast.

Three small islands lie to the immediate south-east and all are administratively part of the [[Klungkung]] regency of Bali: [[Nusa Penida]], [[Nusa Lembongan]] and [[Nusa Ceningan]]. These islands are separated from Bali by the [[Badung Strait]].

To the east, the [[Lombok Strait]] separates Bali from [[Lombok]] and marks the [[Biogeography|biogeographical]] division between the fauna of the [[Indomalayan realm]] and the distinctly different fauna of [[Australasian realm|Australasia]]. The transition is known as the [[Wallace Line]], named after [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], who first proposed a transition zone between these two major [[biome]]s. When sea levels dropped during the [[quaternary glaciation|Pleistocene ice age]], Bali was connected to Java and [[Sumatra]] and to the mainland of Asia and shared the Asian fauna, but the deep water of the Lombok Strait continued to keep Lombok Island and the [[Lesser Sunda Islands|Lesser Sunda archipelago]] isolated.

=== Climate ===
Being just 8 degrees south of the equator, Bali has a fairly even climate all year round. Average year-round temperature stands at around {{convert|30|°C}} with a humidity level of about 85%.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bali.com/news_weather.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030609235930/http://bali.com/news_weather.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 June 2003 |title=Climate of Bali |publisher=bali.com |access-date=10 October 2017 }}</ref>

Daytime temperatures at low elevations vary between {{convert|20|and|33|°C|°F}}, but the temperatures decrease significantly with increasing elevation.

The west monsoon is in place from approximately October to April, and this can bring significant rain, particularly from December to March. During the rainy season, there are comparatively fewer tourists seen in Bali. During the Easter and Christmas holidays, the weather is very unpredictable. Outside of the monsoon period, humidity is relatively low and any rain is unlikely in lowland areas.

[[Squirrel]]s are quite commonly encountered, less often is the [[Asian palm civet]], which is also kept in coffee farms to produce [[kopi luwak]]. [[Bat]]s are well represented, perhaps the most famous place to encounter them remaining is the Goa Lawah (Temple of the Bats) where they are worshipped by the locals and also constitute a tourist attraction. They also occur in other cave temples, for instance at Gangga Beach. Two species of [[Old World monkey|monkey]] occur. The [[crab-eating macaque]], known locally as "kera", is quite common around human settlements and temples, where it becomes accustomed to being fed by humans, particularly in any of the three "monkey forest" temples, such as the popular one in the [[Ubud]] area. They are also quite often kept as pets by locals. The second monkey, endemic to Java and some surrounding islands such as Bali, is far rarer and more elusive and is the [[Javan langur]], locally known as "lutung". They occur in a few places apart from the [[West Bali National Park]]. They are born an orange colour, though they would have already changed to a more blackish colouration by their first year.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} In Java, however, there is more of a tendency for this species to retain its juvenile orange colour into adulthood, and a mixture of black and orange monkeys can be seen together as a family.

The province forms one of Indonesia's 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the [[Indonesian Parliament|People's Representative Council]]. The '''Bali Electoral District''' consists of all of the 8 regencies in the province, together with the city of Denpasar, and elects 9 members to the People's Representative Council.<ref>Law No. 7/2017 (''UU No. 7 Tahun 2017'') as amended by Government Regulation in Lieu of Law No. 1/2022 and Regulation of General Elections Commission No. 6/2023.</ref>

== Economy ==
In the 1970s, the Balinese economy was largely agriculture-based in terms of both output and employment.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lfPJAwAAQBAJ|title=The Territories of Indonesia|last=Brown|first=Iem|date=17 June 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-35541-8|pages=149|language=en}}</ref> Tourism is now the largest single industry in terms of income, and as a result, Bali is one of Indonesia's wealthiest regions. In 2003, around 80% of Bali's economy was tourism related.<ref name="tourism">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080821140830/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,393799,00.html Desperately Seeking Survival] ''Time''. 25 November 2002.</ref> By the end of June 2011, the rate of [[non-performing loan]]s of all banks in Bali were 2.23%, lower than the average of Indonesian banking industry non-performing loan rates (about 5%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/07/25/only-223-percent-loans-bali-are-bad.html |title=Only 2.23 percent of loans in Bali are bad |work=The Jakarta Post |date=25 July 2011 |access-date=30 December 2012}}</ref> The economy, however, suffered significantly as a result of the terrorist bombings in [[2002 Bali bombing|2002]] and [[2005 Bali bombing|2005]]. The tourism industry has since recovered from these events.

=== Agriculture ===
[[File:Wood carving in Bali.jpg|thumb|[[Wood carving]]]]

Although tourism produces the GDP's largest output, agriculture is still the island's biggest employer.<ref>On the history of rice-growing related to museology and the rice terraces as part of Bali's cultural heritage see Marc-Antonio Barblan, "D'Orient en Occident: Histoire de la riziculture et muséologie" in ''ICOFOM Study Series'', Vol.35 (2006), pp.114–131.

Bali is also famous for its [[artisan]]s who produce a vast array of handicrafts, including [[batik]] and [[ikat]] [[Bali Nusra Tangi|cloth and clothing]], [[Woodworking|wooden carvings]], stone carvings, painted art and silverware. Notably, individual villages typically adopt a single product, such as wind chimes or wooden furniture.

The [[Coffea arabica|Arabica coffee]] production region is the highland region of [[Kintamani, Bali|Kintamani]] near [[Mount Batur]]. Generally, Balinese coffee is processed using the wet method. This results in a sweet, soft coffee with good consistency. Typical flavours include lemon and other citrus notes.<ref name="SCAI">{{cite web|url=http://www.sca-indo.org/diverse-coffees-indonesia/ |title=Diverse coffees of Indonesia |work=Specialty Coffee Association of Indonesia |access-date=8 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802030333/http://www.sca-indo.org/diverse-coffees-indonesia/ |archive-date=2 August 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Many coffee farmers in Kintamani are members of a traditional farming system called [[Subak (irrigation)|Subak Abian]], which is based on the [[Hindu]] philosophy of "[[Tri Hita Karana]]". According to this philosophy, the three causes of happiness are good relations with [[God]], other people, and the environment. The Subak Abian system is ideally suited to the production of [[fair trade coffee|fair trade]] and [[organic coffee]] production. Arabica coffee from Kintamani is the first product in Indonesia to request a [[geographical indication]].<ref name="BaliKintamani">"Book of Requirements for Kopi Kintamani Bali", page 12, July 2007</ref>

[[File:Nyepifest auf Bali.jpg|thumb|''[[Ogoh-ogoh]]'' procession on the eve of ''[[Nyepi]]'']]
In 1963 the Bali Beach Hotel in [[Sanur, Bali|Sanur]] was built by [[Sukarno]] and boosted tourism in Bali. Before the Bali Beach Hotel construction, there were only three significant tourist-class hotels on the island.<ref name="Vickers89">Adrian Vickers: Bali. A Paradise Created, Periplus 1989, p. 252, {{ISBN|0-945971-28-1}}.</ref> Construction of hotels and restaurants began to spread throughout Bali. Tourism further increased in Bali after the [[Ngurah Rai International Airport]] opened in 1970. The Buleleng regency government encouraged the tourism sector as one of the mainstays for economic progress and social welfare.

The [[tourism industry]] is primarily focused in the south, while also significant in the other parts of the island. The prominent tourist locations are the town of [[Kuta, Bali|Kuta]] (with its beach), and its outer suburbs of [[Legian]] and [[Seminyak]] (which were once independent townships), the east coast town of [[Sanur (Bali)|Sanur]] (once the only tourist hub), [[Ubud]] towards the centre of the island, to the south of the [[Ngurah Rai International Airport]], [[Jimbaran]] and the newer developments of [[Nusa Dua]] and [[Pecatu]].

The United States government lifted its travel warnings in 2008. The Australian government issued an advisory on Friday, 4 May 2012, with the overall level of this advisory lowered to 'Exercise a high degree of caution'. The Swedish government issued a new warning on Sunday, 10 June 2012, because of one tourist who died from methanol poisoning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.makemyholidaytrips.com/|title=Make My Holiday Trips|date=30 June 2012|publisher=thelocal.se|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191018181134/http://www.makemyholidaytrips.com/|archive-date=18 October 2019|access-date=2 November 2019}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=January 2024}} Australia last issued an advisory on Monday, 5 January 2015, due to new terrorist threats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.smartraveller.gov.au/siteassets/indonesia/index.htm |publisher=Australian Government |title=Smart Traveller |date=15 January 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115201907/http://www2.smartraveller.gov.au/siteassets/indonesia/index.htm |archive-date=15 January 2015 }}</ref>

An offshoot of tourism is the growing real estate industry. Bali's real estate has been rapidly developing in the main tourist areas of Kuta, Legian, Seminyak, and Oberoi. Most recently, high-end 5-star projects are under development on the Bukit peninsula, on the island's south side. Expensive villas are being developed along the cliff sides of south Bali, with commanding panoramic ocean views. Foreign and domestic, many [[Jakarta]] individuals and companies are fairly active, and investment into other areas of the island also continues to grow. Land prices, despite the worldwide economic crisis, have remained stable.

In the last half of 2008, Indonesia's currency had dropped approximately 30% against the US dollar, providing many overseas visitors with improved value for their currencies.

Bali's tourism economy survived the [[Islamists|Islamist]] terrorist bombings of 2002 and 2005, and the tourism industry has slowly recovered and surpassed its pre-terrorist bombing levels; the long-term trend has been a steady increase in visitor arrivals. In 2010, Bali received 2.57&nbsp;million foreign tourists, which surpassed the target of 2.0–2.3&nbsp;million tourists. The average occupancy of starred hotels achieved 65%, so the island still should be able to accommodate tourists for some years without any addition of new rooms/hotels,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebalitimes.com/2011/02/17/up-to-2-8m-foreign-tourists-this-year/ |title=Up to 2.8m Foreign Tourists This Year |publisher=Thebalitimes.com |date=17 February 2011 |access-date=30 December 2012}}</ref> although at the peak season some of them are fully booked.

Bali received the Best Island award from [[Travel and Leisure]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://amarigepanache.com/2010/10/16/travel-all-we-want-for-christmas-a-spa-voucher/ |title=The Best Search Links on the Net |publisher=amarigepanache.com |date=16 October 2010 |access-date=30 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426061733/http://amarigepanache.com/2010/10/16/travel-all-we-want-for-christmas-a-spa-voucher/ |archive-date=26 April 2012 }}</ref> Bali won because of its attractive surroundings (both mountain and coastal areas), diverse tourist attractions, excellent international and local restaurants, and the friendliness of the local people. The Balinese culture and its religion are also considered the main factor of the award. One of the most prestigious events that symbolize a strong relationship between a god and its followers is [[Kecak]] dance. According to BBC Travel released in 2011, Bali is one of the World's Best Islands, ranking second after [[Santorini]], Greece.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beatmag.com/daily/latest-news/bali-named-as-one-of-the-five-best-islands-in-the-world.html |title=Bali Named as One of the Five Best Islands in the World |work=The Beat Magazine (Jakarta) |date=1 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204030756/http://beatmag.com/daily/latest-news/bali-named-as-one-of-the-five-best-islands-in-the-world.html |archive-date=4 December 2011 }}</ref>

In 2006, [[Elizabeth Gilbert]]'s memoir ''[[Eat, Pray, Love]]'' was published, and in August 2010 it was adapted into the film ''[[Eat Pray Love]]''. It took place at Ubud and [[Padang Padang Beach|Padang-Padang Beach]] in Bali. Both the book and the film fuelled a boom in tourism in Ubud, the hill town and cultural and tourist centre that was the focus of Gilbert's quest for balance and love through traditional spirituality and healing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/LH18Ae01.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820031853/http://atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/LH18Ae01.html |url-status=unfit |archive-date=20 August 2010 |title=Southeast Asia news and business from Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam |work=Asia Times |date=18 August 2010 |access-date=30 December 2012}}</ref>

Since 2011, China has displaced Japan as the second-largest supplier of tourists to Bali, while Australia still tops the list while India has also emerged as a greater supply of tourists.

The [[Ngurah Rai Airport|Ngurah Rai International Airport]] is located near Jimbaran, on the [[isthmus]] at the southernmost part of the island. [[Lt. Col. Wisnu Airfield]] is in northwest Bali.

A coastal road circles the island, and three major two-lane arteries cross the central mountains at passes reaching 1,750&nbsp;m in height (at Penelokan). The Ngurah Rai Bypass is a four-lane expressway that partly encircles Denpasar. Bali has no railway lines. There is a car ferry between Gilimanuk on the west coast of Bali to Ketapang on [[Java]].

In May 2011, an integrated Area Traffic Control System (ATCS) was implemented to reduce traffic jams at four crossing points: Ngurah Rai statue, Dewa Ruci Kuta crossing, Jimbaran crossing and Sanur crossing. ATCS is an integrated system connecting all [[traffic lights]], CCTVs and other traffic signals with a monitoring office at the police headquarters. It has successfully been implemented in other [[ASEAN]] countries and will be implemented at other crossings in Bali.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://komisikepolisianindonesia.com/kasus/read/3013/pemprov-bali-gunakan-teknologi-baru-atasi-kemacetan.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221232915/http://komisikepolisianindonesia.com/kasus/read/3013/pemprov-bali-gunakan-teknologi-baru-atasi-kemacetan.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 December 2016 |title=Pemprov Bali Gunakan Teknologi Baru Atasi Kemacetan |publisher=Media Indonesia |date=12 May 2011 |author=Dhae, Arnold |access-date=30 December 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/05/25/new-traffic-control-system-buses-hoped-ease-congestion.html |title=New traffic control system, buses hoped to ease congestion |work=The Jakarta Post |date=25 May 2011 |access-date=30 December 2012}}</ref>
[[File:Tol Benoa-Jimbaran (27432911116).jpg|thumb| [[Bali Mandara Toll Road]] view above the sea]]
On 21 December 2011, construction started on the Nusa Dua-Benoa-[[Ngurah Rai International Airport]] toll road, which will also provide a special lane for motorcycles. This has been done by seven state-owned enterprises led by PT Jasa Marga with 60% of the shares. PT Jasa Marga Bali Tol will construct the {{convert|9.91|km|mi|2|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} toll road (totally {{convert|12.7|km|mi|2|abbr=off}} with access road). The construction is estimated to cost Rp.2.49&nbsp;trillion ($273.9&nbsp;million). The project goes through {{convert|2|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} of mangrove forest and through {{convert|2.3|km|mi|1|abbr=off}} of beach, both within {{convert|5.4|ha|abbr=off}} area. The elevated toll road is built over the mangrove forest on 18,000 concrete pillars that occupied two hectares of mangrove forest. This was compensated by the planting of 300,000 mangrove trees along the road. On 21 December 2011, the Dewa Ruci {{convert|450|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off}} underpass has also started on the busy Dewa Ruci junction near Bali Kuta Galeria with an estimated cost of Rp136&nbsp;billion ($14.9&nbsp;million) from the state budget.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/09/05/new-toll-road-ease-congestion-increase-tourists.html |work=The Jakarta Post|title=New toll road to ease congestion, increase tourists |date=5 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indopos.co.id/index.php/arsip-berita-nasional/75-nasional-reviews/15994-tol-di-atas-laut-mulai-dikonstruksi.html |publisher=indopos.co.id |title=Tol di Atas Laut Mulai Dikonstruksi |access-date=4 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007000802/http://www.indopos.co.id/index.php/arsip-berita-nasional/75-nasional-reviews/15994-tol-di-atas-laut-mulai-dikonstruksi.html |archive-date=7 October 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/12/22/bali-starts-construction-crucial-toll-road-underpass.html |work=The Jakarta Post |title=Bali starts construction on crucial toll road, underpass |date=22 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114051111/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/12/22/bali-starts-construction-crucial-toll-road-underpass.html |archive-date=14 January 2012 }}</ref> On 23 September 2013, the [[Bali Mandara Toll Road]] was opened, with the Dewa Ruci Junction underpass being opened previously.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antara.co.id/en/news/90837/president-officially-opens-bali-toll-road |title=President officially opens Bali toll road |date=23 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925175139/http://www.antara.co.id/en/news/90837/president-officially-opens-bali-toll-road |archive-date=25 September 2013 }}</ref>

Pre-modern Bali had four castes, as Jeff Lewis and Belinda Lewis state, but with a "very strong tradition of communal decision-making and interdependence".<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jeff Lewis|author2=Belinda Lewis|title=Bali's silent crisis: desire, tragedy, and transition|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yuNMcfJHeyUC |year= 2009|publisher= Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-3243-2|pages=56, 83–86}}</ref> The four castes have been classified as Sudra ([[Shudra]]), Wesia ([[Vaishya]]s), [[Balinese Kshatriya|Satria]] ([[Kshatriya]]s) and Brahmana ([[Brahmin]]).<ref>{{cite book|author= Geoffrey Robinson|title= The Dark Side of Paradise: Political Violence in Bali|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=m3Gfir3Ju70C |year=1995| publisher= Cornell University Press|isbn= 0-8014-8172-4|page=32}}</ref>

The 19th-century scholars such as Crawfurd and Friederich suggested that the Balinese caste system had Indian origins, but Helen Creese states that scholars such as Brumund who had visited and stayed on the island of Bali suggested that his field observations conflicted with the "received understandings concerning its Indian origins".<ref name="Creese2016p305">{{cite book|author=Helen M.

[[File:Pura Bratan Bali.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pura Ulun Danu Bratan]]]]

The Bali tradition adopted the pre-existing animistic traditions of the indigenous people. This influence strengthened the belief that the gods and goddesses are present in all things. Every element of nature, therefore, possesses its power, which reflects the power of the gods. A rock, tree, dagger, or woven cloth is a potential home for spirits whose energy can be directed for good or evil. Balinese Hinduism is deeply interwoven with art and ritual. Ritualising states of self-control are a notable feature of religious expression among the people, who for this reason have become famous for their graceful and decorous behaviour.<ref>Slattum, J. (2003) ''Balinese Masks: Spirits of an Ancient Drama. Indonesia, Asia Pacific, Japan, North America, Latin America, and Europe'' Periplus Editions (H) Ltd</ref>

Apart from the majority of Balinese Hindus, there also exist [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]] immigrants whose traditions have melded with that of the locals. As a result, these Sino-Balinese embrace their original religion, which is a mixture of Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism, and Confucianism, and find a way to harmonise it with the local traditions. Hence, it is not uncommon to find local Sino-Balinese during the local temple's ''[[odalan]]''. Moreover, Balinese Hindu priests are invited to perform rites alongside a Chinese priest in the event of the death of a Sino-Balinese. Nevertheless, the Sino-Balinese claim to embrace Buddhism for administrative purposes, such as their Identity Cards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://voicesoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2021/01/hectic-yet-void-week.html |title=Hectic, yet void, week |publisher=Voicesoftheshadows.blogspot.com |date=7 May 2009 |access-date=30 December 2012}}</ref> The [[Catholic Church in Indonesia|Roman Catholic community]] has a [[diocese]], the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Denpasar|Diocese of Denpasar]] that encompasses the province of Bali and [[West Nusa Tenggara]] and has its [[cathedral]] located in [[Denpasar]].

[[Balinese language|Balinese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] are the most widely spoken languages in Bali, and the vast majority of [[Balinese people]] are [[bilingual]] or [[trilingual]]. The most common spoken language around the tourist areas is Indonesian, as many people in the tourist sector are not solely Balinese, but migrants from [[Java]], [[Lombok]], [[Sumatra]], and other parts of Indonesia. The Balinese language is heavily [[Register (sociolinguistics)|stratified]] due to the [[Balinese caste system]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=I Wayan Arka |year=2005 |title=Speech Levels, Social Predicates and Pragmatic Structure in Balinese: A Lexical Approach |journal=Pragmatics |volume=15 |issue=2–3 |pages=169–203 |doi=10.1075/prag.15.2-3.02ark |doi-access=free}}</ref> [[Kawi language|Kawi]] and [[Sanskrit]] are also commonly used by some Hindu priests in Bali, as Hindu literature was mostly written in Sanskrit.

[[English language|English]] and Chinese are the next most common languages (and the primary foreign languages) of many Balinese, owing to the requirements of the [[tourism industry]], as well as the English-speaking community and huge Chinese-Indonesian population. Other foreign languages, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]] or [[German language|German]] are often used in multilingual signs for foreign tourists.

=== Architecture ===
''Kaja'' and ''kelod'' are the Balinese equivalents of North and South, which refer to one's orientation between the island's largest mountain Gunung Agung (''kaja''), and the sea (''kelod''). In addition to spatial orientation, ''kaja'' and ''kelod'' have the connotation of good and evil; gods and ancestors are believed to live on the mountain whereas demons live in the sea. Buildings such as temples and residential homes are spatially oriented by having the most sacred spaces closest to the mountain and the unclean places nearest to the sea.<ref name=Herbst /><ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 19.</ref>

Most temples have an inner courtyard and an outer courtyard which are arranged with the inner courtyard furthest ''kaja''. These spaces serve as performance venues since most Balinese rituals are accompanied by any combination of music, dance, and drama. The performances that take place in the inner courtyard are classified as ''wali'', the most sacred rituals which are offerings exclusively for the gods, while the outer courtyard is where ''bebali'' ceremonies are held, which are intended for gods and people. Lastly, performances meant solely for the entertainment of humans take place outside the temple's walls and are called ''bali-balihan''. This three-tiered system of classification was standardised in 1971 by a committee of Balinese officials and artists to better protect the sanctity of the oldest and most sacred Balinese rituals from being performed for a paying audience.<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], pp.&nbsp;18–26.</ref>

=== Dances ===
Tourism, Bali's chief industry, has provided the island with a foreign audience that is eager to pay for entertainment, thus creating new performance opportunities and more demand for performers. The impact of [[tourism in indonesia|tourism]] is controversial since before it became integrated into the economy, the Balinese performing arts did not exist as a capitalist venture, and were not performed for entertainment outside of their respective ritual context. Since the 1930s sacred rituals such as the ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'' [[Balinese dance|dance]] have been performed both in their original contexts, as well as exclusively for paying tourists. This has led to new versions of many of these performances that have developed according to the preferences of foreign audiences; some villages have a ''barong'' mask specifically for non-ritual performances and an older mask that is only used for sacred performances.<ref name=Sanger />

=== Festivals ===
Throughout the year, there are many festivals celebrated locally or island-wide according to the traditional calendars.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FaTTAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT25|title= Rough Guide to Bali & Lombok|isbn=978-1-4053-8135-2|publisher=[[Rough Guides]]|year=2011}}</ref> The Hindu New Year, ''[[Nyepi]]'', is celebrated in the spring by a day of silence. On this day everyone stays at home and tourists are encouraged (or required) to remain in their hotels. On the day before New Year, large and colourful sculptures of ''[[Ogoh-ogoh]]'' monsters are paraded and burned in the evening to drive away evil spirits. Other festivals throughout the year are specified by the Balinese ''[[pawukon]]'' [[calendar|calendrical]] system.

Celebrations are held for many occasions such as a tooth-filing (coming-of-age ritual), [[Ngaben|cremation]] or ''odalan'' (temple festival). One of the most important concepts that Balinese ceremonies have in common is that of ''désa kala patra'', which refers to how ritual performances must be appropriate in both the specific and general social context.<ref name=Herbst /> Many ceremonial art forms such as ''[[wayang]] kulit'' and ''[[topeng]]'' are highly improvisatory, providing flexibility for the performer to adapt the performance to the current situation.<ref name=Foley /> Many celebrations call for a loud, boisterous atmosphere with much activity, and the resulting aesthetic, ''ramé'', is distinctively Balinese. Often two or more ''[[Music of Bali|gamelan]]'' ensembles will be performing well within earshot, and sometimes compete with each other to be heard. Likewise, the audience members talk amongst themselves, get up and walk around, or even cheer on the performance, which adds to the many layers of activity and the liveliness typical of ''ramé''.<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 8.</ref>

=== Tradition ===
Balinese society continues to revolve around each family's ancestral village, to which the cycle of life and religion is closely tied.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news|last=Belford|first=Aubrey|title=Customary Law Revival Neglects Some Balinese|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html|access-date=12 October 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 October 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130207064353/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html| archive-date=7 February 2013<!-- Bot retrieved archive -->| url-status=live}}</ref> Coercive aspects of traditional society, such as [[customary law]] sanctions imposed by traditional authorities such as village councils (including "[[kasepekang]]", or [[shunning]]) have risen in importance as a consequence of the democratisation and decentralisation of Indonesia since 1998.<ref name="NYT" />

Other than Balinese sacred rituals and festivals, the government presents [[Bali Arts Festival]] to showcase Bali's performing arts and various artworks produced by the local talents that they have. It is held once a year, from the second week of June until the end of July. Southeast Asia's biggest annual festival of words and ideas [[Ubud Writers and Readers Festival]] is held at [[Ubud]] in October, which is participated by the world's most celebrated writers, artists, thinkers, and performers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://asiancorrespondent.com/2018/10/ubud-writers-readers-festival-2018-what-to-expect/|title=What to expect at Southeast Asia's biggest festival of words and ideas|newspaper=Asian Correspondent|access-date=26 October 2018|archive-date=11 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011120908/https://asiancorrespondent.com/2018/10/ubud-writers-readers-festival-2018-what-to-expect/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

One unusual tradition is the naming of children in Bali. In general, Balinese people [[Balinese name#Birth order|name their children]] depending on the order they are born, and the names are the same for both males and females.

=== Beauty pageant ===
Bali was the host of [[Miss World 2013]] (63rd edition of the Miss World pageant). It was the first time Indonesia hosted an international beauty pageant. In 2022, Bali also co-hosted [[Miss Grand International 2022]] along with Jakarta, West Java, and Banten.

In [[association football|football]], Bali is home to [[Bali United]] football club, which plays in [[Liga 1 (Indonesia)|Liga 1]].
The team was relocated from [[Samarinda]], [[East Kalimantan]] to [[Gianyar]], Bali. Harbiansyah Hanafiah, the main commissioner of Bali United explained that he changed the name and moved the home base because there was no representative from Bali in the highest football tier in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribunnews.com/superball/2014/12/17/putra-samarinda-berubah-jadi-bali-united-pusam|title=Putra Samarinda Berubah Jadi Bali United Pusam|access-date= 14 April 2017}}</ref> Another reason was due to local fans in Samarinda preferring to support [[Pusamania Borneo F.C.]] rather than Persisam.
