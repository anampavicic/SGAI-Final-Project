=== Early European settlement (1600–1760) ===
In 1603, French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] reported that the St&nbsp;Lawrence Iroquoians and their settlements had disappeared altogether from the St&nbsp;Lawrence valley.

[[Jérôme le Royer de la Dauversière|Dauversière]] hired [[Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve]], then age 30, to lead a group of colonists to build a mission on his new seigneury. The colonists left France in 1641 for Quebec and arrived on the island the following year. On May 17, 1642, Ville-Marie was founded on the southern shore of Montreal island, with Maisonneuve as its first governor. The settlement included a chapel and a hospital, under the command of [[Jeanne Mance]].<ref name="Miquelon">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/ville-marie-colony|title=Ville-Marie (Colony)|last=Miquelon|first=Dale|encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|access-date=March 29, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203010323/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/ville-marie-colony/|archive-date=December 3, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> By 1643, Ville-Marie had come under Iroquois raids. In 1652, Maisonneuve returned to France to raise 100 volunteers to bolster the colonial population. If the effort had failed, Montreal was to be abandoned and the survivors re-located downriver to [[Quebec City]]. Before these 100 arrived in the fall of 1653, the population of Montreal was barely 50 people.

To encourage French settlement, it wanted the Mohawk to move away from the fur trading post at Ville-Marie. It had a mission village, known as [[Kahnewake]], south of the St Lawrence River. The fathers persuaded some Mohawk to make a new settlement at their former hunting grounds north of the Ottawa River. This became [[Kanesatake]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nfb.ca/film/kanehsatake_270_years_of_resistance/ |title=Alanis Obomsawin, ''Kanesatake: 270 Years of Resistance'', National Film Board of Canada, 1993, accessed Jan 30, 2010 |publisher=National Film Board of Canada |date=February 5, 2010 |access-date=April 13, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404080135/http://www.nfb.ca/film/kanehsatake_270_years_of_resistance/ |archive-date=April 4, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1745, several Mohawk families moved upriver to create another settlement, known as [[Akwesasne]].

=== American occupation (1775–1776) ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2022}}
As part of the [[American Revolution]], the [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|invasion of Quebec]] resulted after [[Benedict Arnold]] captured [[Fort Ticonderoga]] in present-day upstate New York in May 1775 as a launching point to [[Benedict Arnold's expedition to Quebec|Arnold's invasion of Quebec in September]]. While Arnold approached the [[Plains of Abraham]], Montreal fell to American forces led by [[Richard Montgomery]] on November 13, 1775, after it was abandoned by [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]]. After Arnold withdrew from Quebec City to [[Pointe-aux-Trembles]] on November 19, Montgomery's forces left Montreal on December 1 and arrived there on December 3 to plot to [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|attack Quebec City]], with Montgomery leaving [[David Wooster]] in charge of the city. Montgomery was killed in the failed attack and Arnold, who had taken command, sent Brigadier General [[Moses Hazen]] to inform Wooster of the defeat.

Wooster left Hazen in command on March 20, 1776, as he left to replace Arnold in leading further attacks on Quebec City. On April 19, Arnold arrived in Montreal to take over command from Hazen, who remained as his second-in-command. Hazen sent Colonel [[Timothy Bedel]] to form a garrison of 390 men 40 miles upriver in a garrison at [[Les Cèdres, Quebec]], to defend Montreal against the British army. In the [[Battle of the Cedars]], Bedel's lieutenant [[Isaac Butterfield]] surrendered to George Forster.

Forster advanced to [[Fort Senneville]] on May 23. By May 24, Arnold was entrenched in [[Lachine, Quebec|Montreal's borough of Lachine]]. Forster initially approached Lachine, then withdrew to [[Quinze-Chênes]]. Arnold's forces then abandoned Lachine to chase Forster. The Americans burned Senneville on May 26. After Arnold crossed the [[Ottawa River]] in pursuit of Forster, Forster's cannons repelled Arnold's forces. Forster negotiated a prisoner exchange with [[Henry Sherburne]] and Isaac Butterfield, resulting in a May 27 boating of their deputy Lieutenant Park being returned to the Americans. Arnold and Forster negotiated further and more American prisoners were returned to Arnold at [[Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec]], ("Fort Anne") on May 30 (delayed two days by wind).

Arnold eventually withdrew his forces back to the New York fort of Ticonderoga by the summer. On June 15, Arnold's messenger approaching [[Sorel-Tracy|Sorel]] spotted Carleton returning with a fleet of ships and notified him. Arnold's forces abandoned Montreal (attempting to burn it down in the process) prior to the June 17 arrival of Carleton's fleet.

The Americans did not return British prisoners in exchange, as previously agreed, due to accusations of abuse, with Congress repudiating the agreement at the protest of George Washington. Arnold blamed Colonel Timothy Bedel for the defeat, removing him and Lieutenant Butterfield from command and sending them to Sorel for court-martial. The retreat of the American army delayed their court martial until August 1, 1776, when they were convicted and [[cashiered]] at Ticonderoga. Bedel was given a new commission by Congress in October 1777 after Arnold was assigned to defend Rhode Island in [[Military career of Benedict Arnold, 1777–1779|July 1777]].

In the 19th&nbsp;century, maintaining Montreal's drinking water became increasingly difficult with the rapid increase in population. A majority of the drinking water was still coming from the city's harbour, which was busy and heavily trafficked, leading to the deterioration of the water within. In the mid-1840s, the City of Montreal installed a water system that would pump water from the St. Lawrence and into [[cistern]]s. The cisterns would then be transported to the desired location. This was not the first water system of its type in Montreal, as there had been one in private ownership since 1801. In the middle of the 19th&nbsp;century, water distribution was carried out by "fontainiers". The fountainiers{{Clarify|date=February 2022|reason=Two different spellings - which is correct? }} would open and close water valves outside of buildings, as directed, all over the city. As they lacked modern plumbing systems it was impossible to connect all buildings at once and it also acted as a conservation method. However, the population was not finished rising — it rose from 58,000 in 1852 to 267,000 by 1901.<ref>Anderson, Letty. "Water-supply." Building Canada: A History of Public Works. By Norman R. Ball.

The reasons were twofold. First, because it was located more in the interior of the Province of Canada, it was less susceptible to attack from the United States. Second, and perhaps more importantly, because it lay on the border between French and English Canada, Ottawa was seen as a compromise between Montreal, Toronto, [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] and Quebec City, which were all vying to become the young nation's official capital. Ottawa retained the status as capital of Canada when the Province of Canada joined with [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]] to form the Dominion of Canada in 1867.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}}

Montreal was [[Montreal Merger|merged]] with the 27 surrounding municipalities on the Island of Montreal on January 1, 2002, creating a unified city encompassing the entire island.

Several former municipalities, totalling 13% of the population of the island, voted to leave the unified city in separate [[referendum]]s in June 2004. The demerger took place on January 1, 2006, leaving 15 municipalities on the island, including Montreal. Demerged municipalities remain affiliated with the city through an agglomeration council that collects taxes from them to pay for numerous shared services.<ref name="Agglomeration council">{{cite web |title=Agglomeration council |url=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=5977,42239628&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |publisher=Ville de Montréal |access-date=November 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311204346/http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=5977,42239628&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |archive-date=March 11, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> The 2002 mergers were not the first in the city's history.

The 21st&nbsp;century has brought with it a revival of the city's economic and cultural landscape.

Other features of the park are Beaver Lake, a small man-made lake, a short [[skiing|ski]] [[Ski slope|slope]], a [[sculpture garden]], Smith House, an [[interpretive centre]], and a well-known [[George-Étienne Cartier Monument|monument to Sir George-Étienne Cartier]]. The park hosts athletic, tourist and cultural activities.

The mountain is home to two major cemeteries, Notre-Dame-des-Neiges (founded in 1854) and Mount Royal (1852). [[Mount Royal Cemetery]] is a {{convert|165|acre|ha}} terraced cemetery on the north slope of Mount Royal in the borough of Outremont.

Mount Royal Cemetery contains more than 162,000 graves and is the final resting place for a number of notable Canadians. It includes a veterans section with several soldiers who were awarded the [[British Empire]]'s highest military honour, the [[Victoria Cross]]. In 1901, the Mount Royal Cemetery Company established the first crematorium in Canada.<ref name="MountRoyalCemetery">{{cite web|url=http://www.mountroyalcem.com/index.php/en/canadas-first-crematorium.html|title=Mount Royal Crematorium|year=2010|publisher=[[Mount Royal Cemetery]]|access-date=August 12, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117011634/http://mountroyalcem.com/index.php/en/canadas-first-crematorium.html|archive-date=January 17, 2013}}</ref>

The first [[Mount Royal Cross|cross]] on the mountain was placed there in 1643 by Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve, the founder of the city, in fulfilment of a vow he made to the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] when [[prayer|praying]] to her to stop a disastrous flood.<ref name="LesAmisDeLaMontagne"/> Today, the mountain is crowned by a 31.4 m-high (103&nbsp;ft) illuminated cross, installed in 1924 by the [[Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste|John the Baptist Society]] and now owned by the city.<ref name="LesAmisDeLaMontagne"/> It was converted to [[optical fibre|fibre optic]] light in 1992.<ref name="LesAmisDeLaMontagne"/> The new system can turn the lights red, blue, or purple, the last of which is used as a sign of mourning between the death of the Pope and the election of the next.<ref name="Hour">{{cite news|url=http://www.hour.ca/news/brief.aspx?iIDArticle=3438|title=The future of the Mount Royal cross|last=Silverman|first=Craig|date=June 14, 2004|newspaper=[[Hour (magazine)|Hour]]|access-date=February 26, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105013920/http://www.hour.ca/news/brief.aspx?iIDArticle=3438|archive-date=January 5, 2010}}</ref>

{{Main|Culture of Montreal}}
{{more citations needed section|date=May 2022}}
Montreal was referred to as "Canada's Cultural Capital" by [[Monocle (2007 magazine)|''Monocle'' magazine]].<ref name="Monocle"/> The city is Canada's centre for French-language television productions, radio, theatre, film, multimedia, and print publishing. Montreal's many cultural communities have given it a distinct local culture. Montreal was designated as the [[World Book Capital]] for the year 2005 by [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.ifla.org/III/announce/wbc2005.htm|title=World Book Capital 2005|website=archive.ifla.org|access-date=April 19, 2022|archive-date=July 3, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220703091455/https://archive.ifla.org/III/announce/wbc2005.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>
[[File:Montreal Clock Tower, Fireworks.jpg|left|thumb|[[L'International des Feux Loto-Québec|Montreal Fireworks Festival]] is the world's largest annual fireworks festival. The city hosts a number of festivals annually.]]
Being at the confluence of the French and English traditions, Montreal has developed a unique and distinguished cultural face. The city has produced much talent in the fields of visual arts, theatre, dance, and music, with a tradition of producing both jazz and rock music. Another distinctive characteristic of cultural life is the vibrancy of its downtown, particularly during summer, prompted by cultural and social events, including its [[List of festivals and parades in Montreal|more than 100 annual festivals]], the largest being the [[Montreal International Jazz Festival]] which is the largest jazz festival in the world. Other popular events have included [[Just for Laughs]] (the largest comedy festival in the world), the [[Montreal World Film Festival]], the [[Festival du nouveau cinéma]], the [[Fantasia Film Festival]], [[Les FrancoFolies de Montréal]], {{ill|Nuits d'Afrique|fr|Festival international Nuits d'Afrique|v=sup}}, [[Pop Montreal]], [[Divers/Cité]], [[Fierté Montréal]] and the [[Montreal Fireworks Festival]], [[Igloofest]], [[Piknic Électronik|Piknic Electronik]], {{ill|Montréal en Lumiere|fr}}, [[Osheaga Festival|Osheaga]], [[Heavy Montréal|Heavy Montreal]], Mode + Design, {{ill|Montréal complètement cirque|fr}}, [[MUTEK]], [[Black and Blue Festival|Black and Blue]], and many smaller festivals. Montreal is also widely recognized for its diverse and vibrant night life, which is considered a vital part of the local cultural ecosystem.

A cultural heart of classical art and the venue for many summer festivals, the [[Place des Arts]] is a complex of different concert and theatre halls surrounding a large square in the eastern portion of downtown. Place des Arts has the headquarters of one of the world's foremost orchestras, the [[Montreal Symphony Orchestra]]. The [[Orchestre Métropolitain]] and the chamber orchestra [[I Musici de Montréal]] are two other well-regarded Montreal orchestras. Also performing at Place des Arts are the [[Opéra de Montréal]] and the city's chief ballet company [[Les Grands Ballets Canadiens]]. Internationally recognized avant-garde dance troupes such as {{ill|Compagnie Marie Chouinard|fr|v=sup}}, [[La La La Human Steps]], {{ill|O Vertigo|fr|v=sup}}, and the {{ill|Fondation Jean-Pierre Perreault|fr|Jean-Pierre Perreault#Biographie|v=sup}} have toured the world and worked with international popular artists on videos and concerts. The unique choreography of these troupes has paved the way for the success of the world-renowned Cirque du Soleil.

Beginning in the 1940s, Quebec literature began to shift from pastoral tales romanticizing the [[French Canadians|French-Canadian]] countryside to writing set in the multicultural city of Montreal. Notable pioneering works describing the character of the city include [[Gabrielle Roy]]'s 1945 novel [[The Tin Flute|''Bonheur D'Occasion'']], translated as ''The Tin Flute'', and [[Gwethalyn Graham]]'s 1944 novel ''Earth and High Heaven''. Subsequent writers of fiction who have set their work in Montreal have included [[Mordecai Richler]], [[Claude Jasmin]], [[Francine Noel]], and [[Heather O'Neill]], among [[List of people from Montreal|many others]].

{{Main|Sports in Montreal}}
The most popular sport is [[ice hockey]]. The professional hockey team, the [[Montreal Canadiens]], is one of the [[Original Six]] teams of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), and has won an NHL-record 24 [[Stanley Cup]] championships. The Canadiens' most recent Stanley Cup victory came in [[1993 Stanley Cup Finals|1993]]. They have major rivalries with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and [[Boston Bruins]], both of which are also Original Six teams, and with the [[Ottawa Senators]], the closest team geographically. The Canadiens have played at the [[Bell Centre]] since 1996. Prior to that, they played at the [[Montreal Forum]].
[[File:CentreBell.jpg|thumb|left|Opened in 1996, the [[Bell Centre]] is a sports and entertainment complex and the home arena for the [[Montreal Canadiens]].]]
The [[Montreal Alouettes]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) play at [[Percival Molson Memorial Stadium]] on the campus of [[McGill University]] for their regular-season games. Late season and playoff games are sometimes played at the much larger, enclosed Olympic Stadium, which also hosted the [[2008 Grey Cup]]. The Alouettes have won the Grey Cup eight times, most recently in [[111th Grey Cup|2023]]. The Alouettes have had two periods on hiatus. During the second one, the [[Montreal Machine]] played in the [[World League of American Football]] in 1991 and 1992. The [[McGill Redbirds and Martlets|McGill Redbirds]], [[Concordia Stingers]], and [[Université de Montréal Carabins]] play in the [[U Sports football]] league.

Montreal has a storied baseball history. The city was the home of the minor-league [[Montreal Royals]] of the [[International League]] until 1960. In 1946, [[Jackie Robinson]] broke the [[Baseball colour line]] with the Royals in an emotionally difficult year; Robinson was forever grateful for the local fans' fervent support.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.umass.edu/pubaffs/jackie/proballb9a.html |title=Robinson rated ready for Dodgers in '47 |access-date=June 6, 2008 |magazine=The Sporting News |date=August 13, 1946 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103184248/http://www.umass.edu/pubaffs/jackie/proballb9a.html |archive-date=November 3, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Major League Baseball]] came to town in the form of the [[Montreal Expos]] in 1969.

Montreal is the site of a high-profile [[auto racing]] event each year: the Canadian Grand Prix of Formula One (F1) racing.

{{Main|Media in Montreal}}
Montreal is Canada's second-largest media market, and the centre of Canada's francophone media industry.

There are four [[Terrestrial television|over-the-air]] English-language television stations: [[CBMT-DT]] ([[CBC Television]]), [[CFCF-DT]] ([[CTV Television Network|CTV]]), [[CKMI-DT]] ([[Global Television Network|Global]]) and [[CJNT-DT]] ([[Citytv]]). There are also five over-the-air French-language television stations: [[CBFT-DT]] ([[Ici Radio-Canada Télé|Ici Radio-Canada]]), [[CFTM-DT]] ([[TVA (Canadian TV network)|TVA]]), [[CFJP-DT]] ([[Noovo]]), CIVM-DT ([[Télé-Québec]]), and [[CFTU-DT]] (Canal Savoir).

Montreal has three daily newspapers, the English-language ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' and the French-language {{Lang|fr|[[Le Journal de Montréal]]}}, and {{Lang|fr|[[Le Devoir]]}}; another French-language daily, {{Lang|fr|[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]}}, became an online daily in 2018.

== Government ==
{{more citations needed section|date=May 2022}}
{{Main|Montreal City Council|Mayor of Montreal}}
The head of the [[city government in Montreal]] is the mayor, who is [[first among equals]] in the city council.
[[File:Hotel de ville de Montreal 03.jpg|thumb|left|Completed in 1878, [[Montreal City Hall]] is the [[Montreal City Council|seat of local government]].]]
The city council is a democratically elected institution and is the final decision-making authority in the city, although much power is centralized in the executive committee. The council consists of 65 members from all boroughs.<ref name="councillors">{{cite web|url=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=133,1297433&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL|title=City Council|work=City Hall|publisher=Ville de Montréal|access-date=August 2, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005085724/http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=133,1297433&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL|archive-date=October 5, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The council has jurisdiction over many matters, including public security, agreements with other governments, subsidy programs, the [[natural environment|environment]], [[urban planning]], and a three-year capital expenditure program. The council is required to supervise, standardize or approve certain decisions made by the borough councils.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}}

Reporting directly to the council, the executive committee exercises decision-making powers similar to those of the cabinet in a [[parliamentary system]] and is responsible for preparing various documents including [[budget]]s and [[by-law]]s, submitted to the council for approval. The decision-making powers of the executive committee cover, in particular, the awarding of contracts or grants, the management of human and financial resources, supplies and buildings. It may also be assigned further powers by the city council.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}}

Standing committees are the prime instruments for public consultation. They are responsible for the public study of pending matters and for making the appropriate recommendations to the council. They also review the annual budget forecasts for departments under their jurisdiction. A public notice of meeting is published in both French and English daily newspapers at least seven days before each meeting. All meetings include a public question period. The standing committees, of which there are seven, have terms lasting two years. In addition, the City Council may decide to create special committees at any time. Each standing committee is made up of seven to nine members, including a chairman and a vice-chairman. The members are all elected municipal officers, with the exception of a representative of the government of Quebec on the public security committee.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}}

The city is only one component of the larger Montreal Metropolitan Community (Communauté Métropolitaine de Montréal, CMM), which is in charge of planning, coordinating, and financing economic development, public transportation, garbage collection and [[waste management]], etc., across the metropolitan area. The president of the CMM is the mayor of Montreal. The CMM covers {{convert|4360|km2|abbr=on}}, with 3.6&nbsp;million inhabitants in 2006.<ref name="CMM">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmm.qc.ca/index.php?id=334 |title=The CMM at a Glance |work=Statistics |publisher=[[Greater Montreal Area|Montreal Metropolitan Community]] |access-date=August 2, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202161411/http://www.cmm.qc.ca/index.php?id=334 |archive-date=December 2, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{Main|Transportation in Montreal}}
[[File:Montreal autoroute.jpg|thumb|Montreal is a hub for Quebec's [[Autoroutes of Quebec|autoroute]] system of [[controlled-access highway]]s.]]
Like many major cities, Montreal has a problem with vehicular traffic congestion. Commuting traffic from the cities and towns in the West Island (such as [[Dollard-des-Ormeaux]] and [[Pointe-Claire]]) is compounded by commuters entering the city that use twenty-four road crossings from numerous off-island suburbs on the [[North Shore (Laval)|North]] and South Shores. The width of the Saint Lawrence River has made the construction of fixed links to the south shore expensive and difficult. There are presently four road bridges (including two of the country's busiest) along with one bridge-tunnel, two railway bridges, and a metro line. The far narrower Rivière des Prairies to the city's north, separating Montreal from Laval, is spanned by nine road bridges (seven to the city of Laval and two that span directly to the north shore) and a Metro line.

The island of Montreal is a hub for the Quebec [[Autoroute (Quebec)|Autoroute]] system, and is served by Quebec Autoroutes [[Quebec Autoroute 10|A-10]] (known as the Bonaventure Expressway on the island of Montreal), [[Quebec Autoroute 15|A-15]] (aka the Décarie Expressway south of the A-40 and the Laurentian Autoroute to the north of it), [[Quebec Autoroute 13|A-13]] (aka Chomedey Autoroute), [[Quebec Autoroute 20|A-20]], [[Quebec Autoroute 25|A-25]], [[Quebec Autoroute 40|A-40]] (part of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] system, and known as "The Metropolitan" or simply "The Met" in its elevated mid-town section), [[Quebec Autoroute 520|A-520]] and [[Quebec Route 136 (Montreal)|R-136]] (aka the Ville-Marie Autoroute). Many of these Autoroutes are frequently congested at [[rush hour]].<ref name="epomm">{{cite web|url=http://www.epomm.org/ecomm2004/workshops/anglais/Brun.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327022805/http://www.epomm.org/ecomm2004/workshops/anglais/Brun.pdf |archive-date=March 27, 2009 |title=The keys to success for Smart Commuting Montreal, the Downtown Montreal Transportation Management Centre |year=2004 |publisher=European Platform on Mobility Management |access-date=March 26, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, in recent years, the government has acknowledged this problem and is working on long-term solutions to alleviate the congestion.
