Māori oral tradition tells that [[Kupe]] discovered and explored the region in about the 10th century. The area was initially settled by [[Māori people|Māori]] [[iwi]] such as [[Rangitāne]] and [[Muaūpoko]].

Wellington's economy is primarily [[Service sector|service]]-based, with an emphasis on finance, business services, government, and the film industry.

==Toponymy==
Wellington takes its name from [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]], the first [[Duke of Wellington (title)|Duke of Wellington]] and victor of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] (1815): his title comes from the town of [[Wellington, Somerset|Wellington]] in the [[Counties of England|English county]] of [[Somerset]]. It was named in November 1840 by the original settlers of the [[New Zealand Company]] on the suggestion of the directors of the same, in recognition of the Duke's strong support for the company's principles of colonisation and his "strenuous and successful defence against its enemies of the measure for colonising South Australia". One of the founders of the settlement, [[Edward Jerningham Wakefield]], reported that the settlers "took up the views of the directors with great cordiality and the new name was at once adopted".<ref name=Edward>Wakefield, Edward Jerningham (1845). ''Adventure in New Zealand'', Vol. 1, pub. John Murray.</ref>

In the [[Māori language]], Wellington has three names:
*{{lang|mi|[[Te Whanganui-a-Tara]]}}, meaning "the great harbour of Tara", refers to [[Wellington Harbour]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Te Āti Awa of Wellington|encyclopedia=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/te-ati-awa-of-wellington|access-date=28 October 2019|last=Love|first=Morris|date=3 March 2017}}</ref> The primary settlement of Wellington is said to have been executed by Tara, the son of [[Whatonga]], a chief from the [[Māhia Peninsula]], who told his son to travel south, to find more fertile lands to settle.<ref name="WCC_Māori_hist"/>

===Māori settlement===
[[File:Wellington.- Statue de Kupe Raiatea avec son épouse Te Aparangi (focus).jpg|thumb|Wellington – statue of [[Kupe]] Raiatea with his wife Te Aparangi]]
Legends recount that [[Kupe]] discovered and explored the region in about the 10th century. Before European colonisation, the area in which the city of Wellington would eventually be founded was seasonally inhabited by indigenous [[Māori people|Māori]]. The earliest date with hard evidence for human activity in New Zealand is about 1280.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Te Whanganui a Tara me ona takiwa : report on the Wellington District.|last=Waitangi Tribunal.|date=2003|publisher=Legislation Direct|isbn=186956264X|location=Wellington, N.Z.|pages=17|oclc=53261192}}</ref>

Wellington and its environs have been occupied by various Māori groups from the 12th century.

Ngāti Mutunga later moved on to the [[Chatham Islands]]. The [[Waitangi Tribunal]] has found that at the time of the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in 1840, Te Ātiawa, Taranaki, Ngāti Ruanui, Ngāti Tama, and Ngāti Toa held [[mana whenua]] interests in the area, through conquest and occupation.<ref name=":2" />

===Early European settlement===
[[File:Lambton Harbour, Wellington, New Zealand c 1840.jpg|thumb|Lambton Harbour, Port Nicholson ca. 1840]]
Steps towards [[European settlers in New Zealand|European settlement]] in the area began in 1839, when Colonel [[William Wakefield]] arrived to purchase land for the [[New Zealand Company]] to sell to prospective [[British empire|British]] settlers.<ref name=":2" /> Prior to this time, the Māori inhabitants had had contact with Pākehā whalers and traders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.govt.nz/dmsdocument/5820.pdf|title=Deed of Settlement of Historical Claims signed between Taranaki Whānui ki Te Upoko o Te Ika and the Port Nicholson Block Settlement Trust and The Sovereign in Right of New Zealand|date=19 August 2008|website=New Zealand Government|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204122027/https://www.govt.nz/dmsdocument/5820.pdf|archive-date=4 February 2018|url-status=dead|access-date=15 September 2018|page=8|quote=The importance of the Harbour to Taranaki Whanui ki Te Upoko o Te Ika increased as trade was entered into early in the 19th century.}}</ref>

European settlement began with the arrival of an advance party of the New Zealand Company on the ship ''[[New Zealand Company ships#Tory|Tory]]'' on 20 September 1839, followed by 150 settlers on the ''[[New Zealand Company ships#Aurora|Aurora]]'' on 22 January 1840. Thus, the Wellington settlement preceded the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] (on 6 February 1840). The 1840 settlers constructed their first homes at [[Petone]] (which they called Britannia for a time) on the flat area at the mouth of the [[Hutt River (New Zealand)|Hutt River]]. Within months that area proved swampy and flood-prone, and most of the newcomers transplanted their settlement across Wellington Harbour to [[Thorndon, New Zealand|Thorndon]] in the present-day site of Wellington city.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Easther|first=John|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34915088|title=The Hutt River = Te-Awa-kai-rangi : a modern history, 1840–1990|publisher=Wellington Regional Council|year=1991|isbn=0-909016-09-7|location=Wellington [N.Z.]|pages=24–29|oclc=34915088}}</ref>

Wellington was declared a city in 1840, and was chosen to be the capital city of New Zealand in [[timeline of New Zealand history#1860s|1865]].<ref name="Levine" />

Wellington became the capital city in place of [[Auckland]], which [[William Hobson]] had made the capital in [[timeline of New Zealand history#1840s|1841]]. The [[New Zealand Parliament]] had first met in Wellington on 7 July 1862, on a temporary basis; in November 1863, the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]], [[Alfred Domett]], placed a resolution before Parliament in Auckland that "... it has become necessary that the [[seat of government]]&nbsp;... should be transferred to some suitable locality in [[Cook Strait]] [region]." There had been some concerns that the more populous [[South Island]] (where the goldfields were located) would choose to form a separate colony in the [[British Empire]]. Several commissioners (delegates) invited from Australia, chosen for their neutral status, declared that the city was a suitable location because of its central location in New Zealand and its good [[Wellington Harbour|harbour]]; it was believed that the whole [[Royal Navy]] fleet could fit into the harbour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/history-of-new-zealand-1769-1914|title=History of New Zealand, 1769–1914 – A history of New Zealand 1769–1914|website=nzhistory.govt.nz|publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]|access-date=10 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720150026/https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/history-of-new-zealand-1769-1914|archive-date=20 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Wellington's status as the capital is a result of [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] rather than statute.<ref name="Levine" />

Wellington is New Zealand's [[politics of New Zealand|political]] centre, housing the nation's major government institutions. The New Zealand Parliament relocated to the new capital city, having spent the first ten years of its existence in Auckland.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parliament moves to Wellington|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/parliament-sits-for-the-first-time-in-wellington|website=nzhistory.govt.nz|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|access-date=25 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425175533/https://nzhistory.govt.nz/parliament-sits-for-the-first-time-in-wellington|archive-date=25 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A session of parliament officially met in the capital for the first time on 26 July 1865.

The [[Old Government Buildings, Wellington|Government Buildings]] were constructed at [[Lambton Quay]] in 1876. The site housed the original [[public sector organisations in New Zealand|government departments in New Zealand]]. The public service rapidly expanded beyond the capacity of the building, with the first department leaving shortly after it was opened; by 1975 only the Education Department remained, and by 1990 the building was empty. The capital city is also the location of the highest court, the [[Supreme Court of New Zealand]], and the historic former High Court building (opened 1881) has been enlarged and restored for its use. The Governor-General's residence, [[Government House, Wellington|Government House]] (the current building completed in 1910) is situated in [[Newtown, New Zealand|Newtown]], opposite the [[Basin Reserve]]. [[Premier House]] (built in 1843 for Wellington's first mayor, [[George Hunter (mayor)|George Hunter]]), the official residence of the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime minister]], is in [[Thorndon, New Zealand|Thorndon]] on Tinakori Road.

Over six months in 1939 and 1940, Wellington hosted the [[New Zealand Centennial Exhibition]], celebrating a century since the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]]. Held on 55 acres of land at Rongotai, it featured three exhibition courts, grand Art Deco-style edifices and a hugely popular three-acre amusement park. Wellington attracted more than 2.5 million visitors at a time when New Zealand's population was 1.6 million.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Maclean|first1=Chris|title=Wellington region – Boom and bust: 1900–1940|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/wellington-region/page-9|encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|date=9 July 2007|access-date=23 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720233251/https://teara.govt.nz/en/wellington-region/page-9|archive-date=20 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Wellington, New Zealand.JPG|thumb|Satellite view of the Wellington area]]
Wellington is at the south-western tip of the [[North Island]] on [[Cook Strait]], separating the North and South Islands. On a clear day, the snowcapped [[Kaikōura Ranges]] are visible to the south across the strait. To the north stretch the golden beaches of the [[Kāpiti Coast]]. On the east, the [[Remutaka Range]] divides Wellington from the broad plains of the [[Wairarapa]], a [[list of wine-producing regions|wine region]] of national notability.

Wellington is more densely populated than most other cities in New Zealand due to the restricted amount of land that is available between its harbour and the surrounding hills. It has very few open areas in which to expand, and this has brought about the development of the suburban towns. Because of its location in the [[Roaring Forties]] and its exposure to the winds blowing through [[Cook Strait]], Wellington is the world's windiest city, with an average wind speed of {{convert|27|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite news|title=Where is the world's windiest city?

[[File:Departure (33950426345).jpg|thumb|View of the [[Wellington Harbour]] from [[Mount Cook, Wellington|Mount Cook]]]]
Wellington's scenic natural harbour and green hillsides adorned with tiered suburbs of colonial villas are popular with tourists. The central business district (CBD) is close to Lambton Harbour, an arm of [[Wellington Harbour]], which lies along an active [[Fault (geology)|geological fault]], clearly evident on its straight western shore. The land to the west of this rises abruptly, meaning that many suburbs sit high above the centre of the city. There is a network of bush walks and reserves maintained by the [[Wellington City|Wellington City Council]] and local volunteers. These include [[Otari-Wilton's Bush]], dedicated to the protection and propagation of native plants. The Wellington region has {{convert|500|km2|sqmi|-1}} of regional parks and forests. In the east is the [[Miramar Peninsula]], connected to the rest of the city by a low-lying isthmus at [[Rongotai]], the site of [[Wellington International Airport]]. Industry has developed mainly in the Hutt Valley, where there are food-processing plants, engineering industries, vehicle assembly and oil refineries.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|editor-last=Paxton|editor-first=John|encyclopedia=The Penguin Encyclopedia of Places|title=Wellington, New Zealand|edition=3rd|year=1999|via=[[Credo Reference]]}}</ref>

The narrow entrance to the harbour is to the east of the Miramar Peninsula, and contains the dangerous shallows of [[Barrett Reef]], where many ships have been wrecked (notably the inter-island ferry {{ship|TEV|Wahine}} in [[Timeline of New Zealand history#1960s|1968]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/kids/nzdisasters/wahine.asp|title=New Zealand Disasters – Wahine Shipwreck|publisher=Christchurch City Libraries|date=10 April 1968|access-date=28 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819160954/http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/kids/nzdisasters/wahine.asp|archive-date=19 August 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> The harbour has three islands: [[Matiu/Somes Island]], [[Makaro/Ward Island]] and [[Mokopuna Island]]. Only Matiu/Somes Island is large enough for habitation. It has been used as a quarantine station for people and animals, and was an [[internment|internment camp]] during World War I and World War II. It is a conservation island, providing refuge for [[endangered species]], much like [[Kapiti Island]] farther up the coast. There is access during daylight hours by the Dominion Post Ferry.

Wellington is primarily surrounded by water, but some of the nearby locations are listed below.

===Geology===
Wellington suffered serious damage in a series of [[1848 Marlborough earthquake|earthquakes in 1848]]<ref>{{cite web|date=30 March 2005|title=The 1848 Marlborough earthquake – Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/NaturalHazardsAndDisasters/HistoricEarthquakes/2/en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614222309/http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/NaturalHazardsAndDisasters/HistoricEarthquakes/2/en|archive-date=14 June 2009|access-date=6 February 2009|publisher=Teara.govt.nz}}</ref> and from another earthquake in 1855. The [[1855 Wairarapa earthquake]] occurred on the [[Wairarapa Fault]] to the north and east of Wellington. It was probably the most powerful earthquake in recorded New Zealand history,<ref>{{cite web|date=21 September 2007|title=The 1855 Wairarapa earthquake – Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/NaturalHazardsAndDisasters/HistoricEarthquakes/3/en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221195734/http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/NaturalHazardsAndDisasters/HistoricEarthquakes/3/en|archive-date=21 February 2009|access-date=6 February 2009|publisher=Teara.govt.nz}}</ref> with an estimated magnitude of at least 8.2 on the [[Moment magnitude scale]]. It caused vertical movements of two to three metres over a large area, including raising land out of the harbour and turning it into a tidal swamp. Much of this land was subsequently [[Reclamation of Wellington Harbour|reclaimed]] and is now part of the central business district. For this reason, the street named [[Lambton Quay]] is 100 to 200 metres (325 to 650&nbsp;ft) from the harbour – plaques set into the footpath mark the shoreline in [[Timeline of New Zealand history#1840s|1840]], indicating the extent of reclamation. The [[1942 Wairarapa earthquakes]] caused considerable damage in Wellington.

The area has high seismic activity even by New Zealand standards, with a major fault, the [[Wellington Fault]], running through the centre of the city and several others nearby. Several hundred minor faults lines have been identified within the urban area. Inhabitants, particularly in high-rise buildings, typically notice several earthquakes every year. For many years after the 1855 earthquake, the majority of buildings were made entirely from wood. The 1996-restored [[Government Buildings (Wellington, New Zealand)|Government Buildings]]<ref>{{NZHPT|37|Government Buildings|2009-02-06}}</ref> near Parliament is the largest wooden building in the Southern Hemisphere. While masonry and [[structural steel]] have subsequently been used in building construction, especially for office buildings, [[timber framing]] remains the primary structural component of almost all residential construction. Residents place their confidence in good [[building code|building regulations]], which became more stringent in the 20th century. Since the Canterbury earthquakes of [[2010 Canterbury earthquake|2010]] and [[2011 Christchurch earthquake|2011]], earthquake readiness has become even more of an issue, with buildings declared by [[Wellington City Council]] to be earthquake-prone,<ref>{{cite web|author=Dave Burgess|date=14 March 2011|title=Shuddering in Wellington|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/4761054/Shuddering-in-Wellington|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323052804/http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/4761054/Shuddering-in-Wellington|archive-date=23 March 2011|access-date=28 October 2012|publisher=Fairfax NZ}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Hank Schouten|date=2 June 2012|title=How safe are the capital's office buildings?|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/business/commercial-property/7031111/How-safe-are-the-capitals-office-buildings|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604002602/http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/business/commercial-property/7031111/How-safe-are-the-capitals-office-buildings|archive-date=4 June 2012|access-date=28 October 2012|work=The Dominion Post|location=Wellington}}</ref> and the costs of meeting new standards.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kate Chapman|date=16 October 2012|title=Councillors question quake costs|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/wellington-central/7822064/Councillors-question-quake-costs|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019022226/http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/wellington-central/7822064/Councillors-question-quake-costs|archive-date=19 October 2012|access-date=28 October 2012|work=The Dominion Post|location=Wellington}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Dave Burgess & Hank Schouten|date=1 October 2011|title=Quake shakes capital insurance market|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/5714033/Quake-shakes-capital-insurance-market|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024173536/http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/5714033/Quake-shakes-capital-insurance-market|archive-date=24 October 2012|access-date=28 October 2012|work=The Dominion Post|location=Wellington}}</ref>

At two minutes after midnight on Monday 14 November 2016, the 7.8 magnitude [[2016 Kaikōura earthquake|Kaikōura earthquake]], which was centred between Culverden and Kaikōura in the South Island, caused the Wellington CBD, [[Victoria University of Wellington]], and the [[Public transport in the Wellington Region#Trains|Wellington suburban rail network]] to be largely closed for the day to allow inspections. The earthquake damaged a considerable number of buildings, with 65% of the damage being in Wellington. Subsequently, a number of recent buildings were demolished rather than being rebuilt, often a decision made by the insurer.

Since 2009, house prices in Wellington have increased significantly. In May 2021, the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand (REINZ) reported the median house price was $1,057,000 in Wellington City, $930,000 in Porirua, $873,500 in Lower Hutt and $828,000 in Upper Hutt, compared to a national median house price of $820,000.<ref>{{Cite web|date=15 January 2021|title=Monthly Property Report|url=https://www.reinz.co.nz/Media/Default/Statistic%20Documents/2020/December/REINZ%20Monthly%20Property%20Report%20-%20December%202020.pdf|access-date=23 January 2021|publisher=REINZ|archive-date=16 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210116041217/https://www.reinz.co.nz/Media/Default/Statistic%20Documents/2020/December/REINZ%20Monthly%20Property%20Report%20-%20December%202020.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Infrastructure==
===Electric power===
Wellington's first public electricity supply was established in 1904, alongside the introduction of electric trams, and was originally supplied at 105&nbsp;volts 80&nbsp;hertz. The conversion to the now-standard 230/400&nbsp;volts 50&nbsp;hertz began in 1925, the same year the city was connected to the [[Mangahao Power Station|Mangahao hydroelectric scheme]]. Between 1924 and 1968, the city's supply was supplemented by a coal-fired power station at Evans Bay.<ref>{{cite web|title=Evans Bay Power Station – Engineering New Zealand|url=http://www.engineeringnz.org/our-work/heritage/heritage-records/evans-bay-power-station/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190509100127/https://www.engineeringnz.org/our-work/heritage/heritage-records/evans-bay-power-station/|archive-date=9 May 2019|access-date=9 May 2019|website=engineeringnz.org}}</ref>

Today, Wellington city is supplied from four [[Transpower New Zealand Limited|Transpower]] substations: Takapu Road, Kaiwharawhara, Wilton, and Central Park (Mount Cook). [[Wellington Electricity]] owns and operates the local distribution network.

The city is home to two large wind farms, [[Project West Wind|West Wind]] and [[Mill Creek Wind Farm|Mill Creek]], which combined contribute up to 213&nbsp;MW of electricity to the city and the national grid.

While Wellington experiences regular strong winds, and only 63% of Wellington Electricity's network is underground, the city has a very reliable power supply. In the year to March 2018, Wellington Electricity disclosed the average customer spent just 55 minutes without power due to unplanned outages.<ref>{{cite web|title=EDB Information Disclosure Requirements – Wellington Electricity Lines Limited – year ended 31 March 2018|url=https://www.welectricity.co.nz/dmsdocument/156|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181018122249/https://www.welectricity.co.nz/dmsdocument/156|archive-date=18 October 2018|access-date=18 October 2018}}</ref>

===Natural gas===
Wellington was one of the original nine towns and cities in New Zealand to be supplied with natural gas when the [[Kapuni|Kapuni gas field]] entered production in 1970, and a {{convert|260|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} high-pressure pipeline from the field in Taranaki to the city was completed. The high-pressure transmission pipelines supplying Wellington are now owned and operated by [[First Gas]], with [[Powerco]] owning and operating the medium- and low-pressure distribution pipelines within the urban area.<ref>{{cite web|date=December 2016|title=The New Zealand Gas Story|url=http://gasindustry.co.nz/dmsdocument/5344|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202151245/http://gasindustry.co.nz/dmsdocument/5344|archive-date=2 February 2017|access-date=13 February 2017|publisher=Gas Industry Company}}</ref>

=== The three waters ===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in the Wellington region}}

The "three waters" – [[drinking water]], [[stormwater]], and [[wastewater]] services for the Wellington metropolitan area are provided by five councils: Wellington City, Hutt, Upper Hutt and Porirua city councils, and the [[Wellington Region|Greater Wellington]] Regional Council. However, the water assets of these councils are managed by an [[infrastructure asset management]] company, [[Wellington Water]].

Wellington's first piped water supply came from a spring in 1867.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our water history – on tap Water supply in the Wellington region 1867–2006|url=http://www.gw.govt.nz/assets/Our-Environment/Water-Supply/PDFs/Our-water-history-on-tap-complete-document.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201015113/http://www.gw.govt.nz/assets/Our-Environment/Water-Supply/PDFs/Our-water-history-on-tap-complete-document.pdf|archive-date=1 February 2016|publisher=WRC}}</ref> [[Wellington Region|Greater Wellington Regional Council]] now supplies Lower Hutt, Porirua, Upper Hutt and Wellington with up to 220 million litres a day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bulk water supply – live {{!}} Greater Wellington Regional Council|url=http://www.gw.govt.nz/bulk-water-supply-live/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516004711/http://www.gw.govt.nz/bulk-water-supply-live/|archive-date=16 May 2016|access-date=20 May 2016|website=gw.govt.nz}}</ref> The water comes from [[Wainuiomata River]] (since 1884), [[Hutt River (New Zealand)|Hutt River]] (1914), [[Ōrongorongo River]] (1926) and the [[Waiwhetu Aquifer|Waiwhetū Aquifer]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Watermap {{!}} Greater Wellington Regional Council|url=http://www.gw.govt.nz/live-water-supply/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531161619/http://www.gw.govt.nz/live-water-supply/|archive-date=31 May 2016|access-date=20 May 2016|website=gw.govt.nz}}</ref>

== Media ==

=== Radio ===
Wellington is [[List of radio stations in Wellington|served by 26 full-power radio stations]]: 17 on FM, four on AM, and five on both FM and AM.

=== Television ===
Television broadcasts began in Wellington on 1 July 1961 with the launch of channel WNTV1, becoming the third New Zealand city (after Auckland and Christchurch) to receive regular television broadcasts. WNTV1's main studios were in Waring Taylor Street in central Wellington and broadcast from a transmitter atop Mount Victoria. In 1967, the Mount Victoria transmitter was replaced with a more powerful transmitter at [[Mount Kaukau]].<ref>{{cite news|date=28 June 1967|title=Parliamentary Debates (Hansard)|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|volume=351|page=1394}}</ref> In November 1969, WNTV1 was networked with its counterpart stations in Auckland, Christchurch and Dunedin to form NZBC TV.

In 1975, the NZBC was broken up, with Wellington and Dunedin studios taking over NZBC TV as [[TVNZ 1|Television One]] while Auckland and Christchurch studios launched [[TVNZ 2|Television Two]]. At the same time, the Wellington studios moved to the new purpose-built [[Avalon, New Zealand|Avalon Television Centre]] in Lower Hutt. In 1980, Televisions One and Two merged under a single company, [[TVNZ|Television New Zealand]] (TVNZ). The majority of television production moved to Auckland over the 1980s, culminating in the opening of TVNZ's new Auckland television centre in 1989.

Wellington has [[sister city]] relationships with the following cities:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wellington.govt.nz/about-wellington/international-relations/sister-cities|title=International Relations – Sister Cities|website=Wellington City Council|date=19 February 2015|access-date=1 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129021125/https://wellington.govt.nz/about-wellington/international-relations/sister-cities|archive-date=29 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Wellington metropolitan area==
The wider [[metropolitan area]] for Wellington encompasses areas administered by four [[local government in New Zealand|local authorities]]: [[Wellington City Council|Wellington City]] itself, on the peninsula between Cook Strait and [[Wellington Harbour]]; [[Porirua|Porirua City]] on [[Porirua Harbour]] to the north, notable for its large [[Māori people|Māori]] and [[Pasifika New Zealanders|Pasifika]] communities; and [[Lower Hutt|Lower Hutt City]] and [[Upper Hutt|Upper Hutt City]], largely suburban areas to the northeast, together known as the [[Hutt Valley]]. Depending on the source, the Wellington metro area may include [[Waikanae]], [[Paraparaumu]] and [[Paekākāriki]] on the Kāpiti Coast, and/or [[Featherston, New Zealand|Featherston]] and [[Greytown, New Zealand|Greytown]] in the [[Wairarapa]].

[[File:Wellington Urban Area.png|thumb|left|The Wellington urban area (pink) is administered by four local authorities.]]

[[File:WellingtonRegionPopulationDensity.png|thumb|Population density in Wellington region (2008) based on census data]]

The urban areas of the four local authorities have a combined population of {{Decimals|({{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Porirua|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Upper Hutt|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Lower Hutt|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Wellington|y}}|R}})|0}} residents as of {{NZ population data 2018|||y}}.<ref name="NZ_population_data_2018" />

The four cities comprising the Wellington metropolitan area have a total population of {{formatnum:{{#expr: {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Porirua city|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Upper Hutt city|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Lower Hutt city|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Wellington city|y}}|R}} }}}} {{NZ population data 2018|||y|y|(|),}} with the urban area containing {{Decimals|({{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Porirua|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Upper Hutt|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Lower Hutt|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Wellington|y}}|R}}) / ({{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Porirua city|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Upper Hutt city|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Lower Hutt city|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Wellington city|y}}|R}})*100|1}}% of that population. The remaining areas are largely mountainous and sparsely farmed or parkland and are outside the urban area boundary. More than most cities, life is dominated by its central business district (CBD). Approximately 62,000 people work in the CBD, only 4,000 fewer than work in Auckland's CBD, despite that city having four times the population.

The [[Waikanae]]-[[Paraparaumu]]-[[Paekākāriki]] combined urban area in the Kāpiti Coast district is sometimes included in the Wellington metro area{{By whom|date=February 2021}} due to its exurban nature and strong transport links with Wellington. If included as part of the Wellington metro, Waikanae-Paraparaumu-Paekākāriki would add {{formatnum:{{#expr: {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Paraparaumu|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Waikanae|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Paekakariki|y}}|R}} }}}} to the population (as of {{NZ population data 2018|||y|}}).{{NZ population data 2018||||y}}

[[Featherston, New Zealand|Featherston]] and [[Greytown, New Zealand|Greytown]] in the Wairarapa are rarely considered part of the Wellington metropolitan area, being physically separated from the rest of the metropolitan area by the [[Remutaka Range]]. However, both have significant proportions of their employed population working in Wellington city and the Hutt Valley (36.1% and 17.1% in 2006 respectively)<ref>{{Cite web|last=Goodyear|first=Rosemary|date=July 2008|title=Workforces on the move: An examination of commuting patterns to the cities of Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch|url=https://www.nzae.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/nr1215390093.pdf}}</ref> and are considered part of the Wellington functional urban area by Statistics New Zealand.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Functional urban areas – methodology and classification {{!}} Stats NZ|url=https://www.stats.govt.nz/methods/functional-urban-areas-methodology-and-classification|access-date=23 June 2021|publisher=Statistics New Zealand}}</ref>

The four urban areas combined had a usual resident population of 401,850 at the [[2018 New Zealand census]], an increase of 26,307 people (7.0%) since the [[2013 New Zealand census|2013 census]], and an increase of 42,726 people (11.9%) since the [[2006 New Zealand census|2006 census]]. There were 196,911 males and 204,936 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.961 males per female. Of the total population, 74,892 people (18.6%) were aged up to 15 years, 93,966 (23.4%) were 15 to 29, 185,052 (46.1%) were 30 to 64, and 47,952 (11.9%) were 65 or older.<ref name=":02">{{Cite web|title=Age and sex by ethnic group (grouped total response), for census usually resident population counts, 2006, 2013, and 2018 Censuses (urban rural areas)|url=http://nzdotstat.stats.govt.nz/wbos/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TABLECODE8318|access-date=13 September 2020|website=nzdotstat.stats.govt.nz}}</ref>
