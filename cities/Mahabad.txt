== Etymology ==
Mahabad first became the name of the city after [[World War I]], during the reign of the [[Pahlavi Iran|Pahlavi]] ''[[shah]]'' (king) [[Reza Shah]] ({{reign|1925|1941}}). Before that, it was known as Savojbolagh, a [[Persian language|Persian]] corruption of the [[Turkic language|Turkic]] word ''soghuk bulak'' (meaning "cold spring"). The [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]] version was Sablagh.{{sfn|Minorsky|Bosworth|1997|p=92}}{{sfn|Hassanpour|1989|p=511}}

== History ==
[[File:Coin of Fath-Ali Shah Qajar, minted in Savujbulagh (Mahabad).jpg|thumb|right|Coin of [[Fath-Ali Shah Qajar]] ({{reign}}1797-1834), minted in Savojbolagh (Mahabad), dated 1814/5. Civic copper issue]]
[[File:Panoramic view of Mahabad-19510105-نمایی از شهر مهاباد-۱۳۳۷-۱۰-۱۵.jpg|thumb|Panoramic view of Mahabad in January 1959]]
Savojbolagh is first attested in the 16th century, during the [[Safavid Iran|Safavid]] era.{{sfn|Minorsky|Bosworth|1997|p=92}} [[Mokryan|Mukri]] Kurds participated in several wars between [[Safavid dynasty]] and [[Ottoman Empire]], and gained more predominance. In 17th century AD, Savojbolagh became the seat of Mukri principality (known as [[Mokryan|Mukriyān]] in Sorani Kurdish and Mokriyān in [[Persian language|Persian]]). Many believe Budaq Sultan Mukri, who built Savojbolagh's [[congregational mosque]] is the founder of the current town.

=== Republic of Mahabad ===
{{Main|Republic of Mahabad}}
Mahabad was the capital of the short-lived Republic of Mahabad, which was declared independent on January 1, 1946, under the leadership of Kurdish nationalist [[Qazi Muhammad]].

The republic received strong support from the [[Soviet Union]], which occupied Iran during the same era. It included the majority Kurdish-speaking towns of [[Bukan]], Piranshahr, Sardasht and Oshnavieh.<ref>{{cite book|author=McDowall, David |year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1tarN6gfxX8C&q=%22on+22+January+1946%22 |title=''A modern history of the Kurds''. I.B. Tauris. |pages=244–245|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=1-85043-416-6|access-date=2012-11-18}}</ref>

After an agreement brokered by the United States, the Soviets agreed to leave Iran, and sovereignty was restored to the Shah in 1947. The Shah ordered an invasion of the Republic of Mahabad shortly afterwards, the leaders of the republic including Qazi Muhammad were arrested and executed.<ref>McDowall, David, ''A Modern History of the Kurds'', I. B. Tauris, 1996 (Current revision at May 14, 2004). {{ISBN|1-86064-185-7}}.</ref><ref>[http://members.chello.se/yamulki/frame/eng/culture.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050907235743/http://members.chello.se/yamulki/frame/eng/culture.html |date=September 7, 2005 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.iranica.com/articles/v12f2/v12f2030.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425150036/http://www.iranica.com/articles/v12f2/v12f2030.html |date=April 25, 2006 }}</ref> Qazi Muhammad was hanged on 31 March 1947. At the behest of [[Archibald Bulloch Roosevelt Jr.|Archibald Roosevelt Jr.]], who argued that Qazi had been forced to work with the Soviets out of expediency, U.S. ambassador to Iran [[George V. Allen]] urged the Shah not to execute Qazi or his brother, only to be reassured: "Are you afraid I'm going to have them shot? If so, you can rest your mind. I am not." Roosevelt later recounted that the order to have the Qazis killed was likely issued "as soon as our ambassador had closed the door behind him," adding with regard to the Shah: "I never was one of his admirers."<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilford|first=Hugh|title=America's Great Game: The CIA's Secret Arabists and the Making of the Modern Middle East|publisher=Basic Books|year=2013|isbn=978-0-465-01965-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/americasgreatgam0000wilf/page/53 53]|url=https://archive.org/details/americasgreatgam0000wilf/page/53}}</ref>

=== Islamic Republic of Iran ===
On 7 May 2015, the people of the city rioted following the unexplained death on 4 May 2015 of Farinaz Khosravani, a hotel [[chambermaid]]. Khosravani fell to her death from a fourth-floor window of the Tara hotel, the hotel where she worked. Anger mounted following reports that Khosravani died attempting to escape an official who was threatening to rape her. The rioters reportedly set fire to the hotel where Khosravani worked.<ref>{{cite news |date=7 May 2015 |title=Riot Erupts in Iran's Kurdish Capital Over Woman's Death |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/world/middleeast/riot-erupts-in-irans-kurdish-capital-over-womans-death.html |newspaper=The New York Times }}</ref>
