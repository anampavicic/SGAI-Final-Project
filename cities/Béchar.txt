'''Béchar'''  ({{langx|ar|بشار}}) is the capital city of [[Béchar Province]], Algeria. It is also a [[Communes of Algeria|commune]], coextensive with Béchar District, of Béchar Province.

Béchar thrived on the activity of the coal mines until petroleum production seized the market.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historical|url=http://www.wilaya-bechar.gov.dz/Historique.htm|publisher=Official Website of the Wilaya of Béchar|access-date=9 March 2013|language=fr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216230905/http://www.wilaya-bechar.gov.dz/Historique.htm|archive-date=16 February 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Leatherwork and jewellery are notable products of Béchar. [[Phoenix dactylifera|Dates]], vegetables, [[figs]], cereals and [[almonds]] are produced near Béchar. There are [[bituminous coal]] reserves near Béchar, but they are not exploited to their greatest potential because of transportation costs are too high relative to that from the oil and [[Natural gas|gas]] fields of eastern Algeria.<ref name="Britannica">{{cite web|title=Bechar (Algeria)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/57873/Bechar|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=10 March 2013}}</ref> The city was once the site of a French [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] post.
