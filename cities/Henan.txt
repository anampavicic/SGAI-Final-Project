Widely regarded as one of the cradles of Chinese civilization along with the provinces of Shanxi and Shaanxi, Henan is known for its historical prosperity and periodic downturns.<ref>{{Cite web |title=增强中华文明传播力影响力｜河南：行走中原大地 读懂中国文脉 |url=http://www.cppcc.gov.cn/zxww/2023/05/19/ARTI1684477076032423.shtml |access-date=2024-04-01 |website=www.cppcc.gov.cn}}</ref> The economic prosperity resulted from its extensive fertile plains and its location at the heart of the country. However, its strategic location also means that it has suffered from nearly all of the major wars in China. In addition, the numerous floods of the [[Yellow River]] have caused significant damage from time to time.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Storozum |first1=Michael J |last2=Zhen |first2=Qin |last3=Xiaolin |first3=Ren |last4=Haiming |first4=Li |last5=Yifu |first5=Cui |last6=Kui |first6=Fu |last7=Haiwang |first7=Liu |date=2018-08-02 |title=The collapse of the North Song dynasty and the AD 1048–1128 Yellow River floods: Geoarchaeological evidence from northern Henan Province, China |journal=[[The Holocene]] |language=en |volume=28 |issue=11 |pages=1759–1770 |doi=10.1177/0959683618788682 |bibcode=2018Holoc..28.1759S |issn=0959-6836 |doi-access=free |hdl=10356/137334 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> [[Kaifeng]], in particular, has been buried by China's Yellow River's silt seven times due to flooding.

===Antiquity===
Archaeological sites reveal that prehistoric cultures such as the [[Yangshao Culture]] and [[Longshan Culture]] were active in what is now northern Henan since the [[Neolithic Era]]. The more recent [[Erlitou culture]] has been controversially identified with the [[Xia dynasty]], the first and largely legendary Chinese dynasty that was established,<ref>{{Cite web |title=考古第一现场：神秘夏朝是否真实存在？真相只有一个-中新网 |url=https://www.chinanews.com.cn/cul/2021/02-22/9416419.shtml |access-date=2024-04-01 |website=www.chinanews.com.cn}}</ref> roughly, in the 21st century&nbsp;BC. Virtually the entire kingdom existed within what is now north and central Henan.

The Xia dynasty collapsed around the 16th century BC following the invasion of [[Shang dynasty|Shang]], a neighboring [[Ancient Chinese States|vassal state]] centered around today's [[Shangqiu]] in eastern Henan. The [[Shang dynasty]] (16th–11th centuries BC) was the first literate dynasty of China. Its many capitals are located at the modern cities of [[Shangqiu]], [[Yanshi]], and [[Zhengzhou]]. Their last and most important capital of [[Yinxu|Yin]], located in modern [[Anyang]], is where the first Chinese writing was created.

[[File:Shang-Orakelknochen excerpt adjusted for contrast.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.65|Shang dynasty [[oracle bone script]], the first form of [[Chinese writing]]]]
In the 11th century BC, the [[Zhou dynasty]] of [[Shaanxi]] arrived from the west and overthrew the Shang dynasty.<ref>{{Cite web |title=古代中国-中国国家博物馆 |url=https://www.chnmuseum.cn/portals/0/web/zt/gudai/detail2.html |access-date=2024-04-01 |website=www.chnmuseum.cn}}</ref> During the [[Western Zhou]] period (c. 1046 – 771 BC), the capital and political and economical center was moved away from Henan for the first time. The [[Spring and Autumn period]], a period of warfare and rivalry, began in 721&nbsp;BC. What is now Henan and all of China was divided into a variety of small, independent states, constantly at war for control of the central plain. Although regarded formally as the ruler of China, the control that Zhou king in Luoyang exerted over the feudal kingdoms had virtually disappeared. Despite the prolonged period of instability, prominent philosophers such as [[Confucius]] emerged in this era and offered their ideas on how a state should be run. [[Laozi]], the founder of [[Taoism]], was born in northern [[state of Chu|Chu]], part of modern-day Henan.<ref>{{Cite web |title=中国古代著名思想家、道家学派创始人老子 |url=http://ve.china-embassy.gov.cn/zwgx/whjl/qian560/ |access-date=2024-04-01 |website=ve.china-embassy.gov.cn}}</ref>

Later on, these states were replaced by seven large and powerful states during the [[Warring States period]], and Henan was divided into three states, the [[Wei (state)|Wei]] to the north, the [[state of Chu|Chu]] to the south, and the [[state of Han|Han]] in the middle. In 221&nbsp;BC, [[state of Qin]] forces from Shaanxi conquered all of the other six states, ending 800 years of warfare.

===Imperial era===
[[Ying Zheng]], the leader of Qin, crowned himself (220&nbsp;BCE) as the [[Emperor of China|first emperor of China]]. He abolished the feudal system and centralized all powers, establishing the [[Qin dynasty]] and unifying the core of the [[Han Chinese]] homeland for the first time. The empire quickly collapsed after the death (210&nbsp;BCE) of Ying Zheng and was replaced by the [[Han dynasty]] in 206&nbsp;BC, with its capital at Chang'an. Thus, a [[golden age]] of Chinese culture, economy, and military power began. The capital moved east to [[Luoyang]] in 25&nbsp;AD, in response to a coup in Chang'an that created the short-lived [[Xin dynasty]]. Luoyang quickly regained control of China, and the [[Eastern Han dynasty]] (25–220) began, extending the golden age for another two centuries.

The late [[Eastern Han dynasty]] saw war and rivalry between regional warlords. [[Xuchang]] in central Henan was the power base of [[Cao Cao]], who eventually succeeded in unifying all of northern China under the [[Cao Wei|Kingdom of Wei]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=三国时期曹操建魏都于许昌，其实早在春秋末期，这里就是魏国疆土_许国 |url=https://www.sohu.com/a/www.sohu.com/a/450894238_120784094 |access-date=2024-04-01 |website=www.sohu.com}}</ref> Wei then moved its capital to Luoyang, which remained the capital after the unification of China by the Western [[Jin dynasty (265-420)|Jin dynasty]]. During this period Luoyang became one of the largest and most prosperous cities in the world, despite being repeatedly damaged by warfare.

With the fall of the Western Jin dynasty in the 4th and 5th centuries, nomadic peoples from the north invaded northern China and established many successive regimes in northern China, including Henan. These people were gradually assimilated into the [[Chinese culture]] in a process known as [[sinification]].

The short-lived [[Sui dynasty]] reunified China again in 589 with its capital back in Chang'an. It collapsed due to [[Emperor Yang of Sui China|Sui Emperor Yang's]] costly attempt to relocate the capital from Chang'an to Luoyang and the construction of many extravagant palaces there.<ref>{{Cite web |title=中国古代史 中国历史：中国是世界上最早诞生文明的国家之一，有近5000年的历史。中国古代史包括三个阶段：原始社会阶段（距今约170万年前-约公元前2070年）、奴隶社会阶段（约公元前2070年-公元前475年）和封建社会阶段（公元前475年-公元1840年）全文介绍_科技进步_中国管理科学研究院科技管理研究所 |url=http://ceshi.zgykjs.com/index.php?c=show&id=7371 |access-date=2024-04-01 |website=ceshi.zgykjs.com}}</ref> The succeeding [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) kept its capital in [[Chang'an]], marking the beginning of China's second golden age, with Henan being one of the wealthiest places in the empire.

The Tang dynasty lasted for three centuries before it eventually succumbed to internal strife. In the [[Period of Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] (907–960) that followed, [[Kaifeng]] in eastern Henan became the capital of four dynasties. The [[Song dynasty]] that reunified China in 982 also had its capital at Kaifeng. Under Song rule, China entered another era of culture and prosperity, and Kaifeng overtook Luoyang and Chang'an as the largest city in China and in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Development |first=PodBean |title=Feeding and Supplying the World's Largest City: The Environmental Impact of Northern Song Kaifeng {{!}} The Chinese History Podcast |url=http://www.chinesehistorypodcast.com/e/feeding-and-supplying-the-world-largest-city-the-environmental-impact-of-northern-song-kaifeng/ |access-date=2023-09-15 |website=www.chinesehistorypodcast.com |language=en}}</ref> In 1127, however, the Song dynasty succumbed to [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jurchen]] ([[Jinn dynasty|Jin dynasty]]) invaders from the north in the [[Jin campaigns against the Song dynasty|Jin–Song war]], and in 1142 [[Treaty of Shaoxing|ceded]] all of northern China, including Henan. The Song government moved its capital to [[Hangzhou]] in Southern China, which, under the [[Southern Song dynasty]] (1127–1279) continued to enjoy relative economic and culture prosperity. A prolonged period of peace and cultural and economic prosperity in the Yangtze delta ''[[Jiangnan]]'' region (modern southern [[Jiangsu]], northern [[Zhejiang]], and Shanghai) made this the new center of Chinese culture and economy.

Kaifeng served as the Jurchen's "southern capital" from 1157 (other sources say 1161) and was reconstructed during this time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.san.beck.org/AB3-China.html#9|title=Ethics of China 7 BC To 1279 by Sanderson Beck|work=beck.org|access-date=6 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204064227/http://san.beck.org/AB3-China.html#9|archive-date=4 February 2007|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.upkorea.net/news/photo/7345-2-7037.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=6 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705112718/http://www.upkorea.net/news/photo/7345-2-7037.pdf |archive-date=5 July 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> But the Jurchen kept their main capital further north, until 1214, when they were forced to move the imperial court southwards to Kaifeng in order to flee the [[Mongol]] onslaught. In 1234 they succumbed to combined Mongol and [[Song dynasty]] forces. Mongols took control, and in 1279 they conquered all of China, establishing the [[Yuan dynasty]] and set up the equivalent of modern Henan, with borders very similar to the modern ones. Neither its territories nor its role in the economy changed under later dynasties. Henan remained important in the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644) and [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1911) that followed, though its economy slowly deteriorated due to frequent natural disasters.

===Modern era===
The Qing dynasty was overthrown by the 1911 Revolution and then the Republic of China was established in 1912,<ref>{{Cite web |title=纪念辛亥革命100周年 |url=http://www.cppcc.gov.cn/zxww/xinhai100/jlmg/index.shtml |access-date=2024-04-01 |website=www.cppcc.gov.cn}}</ref> during which a man from Henan, [[Yuan Shikai]], played an important role and thus he became the first president of Republic of China.<ref>Shan, Patrick Fuliang (2018).

Despite the rise of Zhengzhou, Henan's overall economy repeatedly stumbled as it was the hardest hit by the many disasters that struck China in its modern era.

Henan suffered greatly during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. In 1938, when the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] captured Kaifeng, the government led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]] bombed the [[Huayuankou, Henan|Huayuankou]] dam in Zhengzhou in order to prevent Japanese forces from advancing further.<ref>{{Cite web |title=花园口:抗战岁月里的黄河之殇-新华网 |url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2015-08/25/c_1116368992.htm |access-date=2024-04-01 |website=www.xinhuanet.com}}</ref> However, this caused massive flooding in Henan, [[Anhui]], and [[Jiangsu]] resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. In 1942 Henan was hit by [[Chinese famine of 1942-43|a great famine]] resulting from a mix of drought, locusts and destruction caused by the war.<ref>{{Cite book |last=宋 |first=致新 |title=1942: 河南大饥荒 |publisher=湖北人民出版社 |year=2005年 |isbn=9787216043229 |pages=171 |language=Chinese |trans-title=1942: Henan Famine}}</ref>

In 1954, the new government of the People's Republic of China moved the capital of Henan from Kaifeng to [[Zhengzhou]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=【解密档案】开封到郑州省会大搬迁-手机大河网 |url=https://4g.dahe.cn/news/20180405293804 |access-date=2024-04-01 |website=4g.dahe.cn}}</ref> as a result of its economic importance. The PRC had earlier established a short-lived [[Pingyuan Province]] consisting of what is now northern Henan and western [[Shandong]] with [[Xinxiang]] as its capital. This province was abolished in 1952.<ref>{{Cite web |title=观察丨河南和山东之间的"平原省"为什么被撤销了？_澎湃号·政务_澎湃新闻-The Paper |url=https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_3850018 |access-date=2024-04-01 |website=www.thepaper.cn}}</ref>

A destructive flooding of the [[Huai River]] in the summer of 1950 prompted large-scale construction of dams on its tributaries in central and southern Henan.
Unfortunately, many of the dams were not able to withstand the extraordinarily high levels of rainfall caused by [[Typhoon Nina (1975)|Typhoon Nina]] in August 1975. Sixty-two dams, the largest of which was the [[Banqiao Dam]] in [[Biyang County]] collapsed; catastrophic flooding, spread over several counties throughout [[Zhumadian]] Prefecture and further downstream, killed at least 26,000 people.<ref name=yi>Yi Si, "The World's Most Catastrophic Dam Failures: The August 1975 Collapse of the Banqiao and Shimantan Dams", in: Dai Qing ''et al'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9w2RfP-mtQC&pg=PA36 The River Dragon Has Come!: The Three Gorges Dam and the Fate of China’s Yangtze River and Its People] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207041824/https://books.google.com/books?id=R9w2RfP-mtQC&pg=PA36 |date=7 February 2016 }}, pp. 25–38.</ref><ref name="After 30 years, secrets, lessons of China's worst dams burst accident surface">{{cite news|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200510/01/eng20051001_211892.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103183714/http://english.people.com.cn/200510/01/eng20051001_211892.html|title=After 30 years, secrets, lessons of China's worst dams burst accident surface|url-status=live|date=1 October 2005|archive-date=3 January 2006|work=[[People's Daily Online]]}}</ref> Unofficial human life loss estimates, including deaths from the ensuing epidemics and famine, range as high as 85,600,<ref name=yi/> 171,000<ref name=osnos>[[Evan Osnos]], "[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/evanosnos/2011/10/faust-china-and-nuclear-power.html Faust, China, and Nuclear Power] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313134654/http://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-china/faust-china-and-nuclear-power |date=13 March 2016 }}".

==Geography==
[[File:Luoyang - Boddhisatvas at Longmen Grotto.jpg|thumb|[[Longmen Grottoes]] in Luoyang]]
Henan has a diverse landscape with floodplains in the east and mountains in the west. Much of the province forms part the densely populated [[North China Plain]], an area known as the "breadbasket of China". The [[Taihang Mountains]] intrude partially into Henan's northwestern borders from [[Shanxi]], forming the eastern edge of [[Loess Plateau]]. To the west the [[Xionger Mountains|Xionger]] and [[Funiu Mountains]] form an extensive network of mountain ranges and plateaus, supporting one of the few remaining [[temperate deciduous forest]]s which once covered all of Henan. The renowned [[Mount Song]] and its [[Shaolin Temple]] is located in the far east of the region, near the capital city Zhengzhou. To the far south, the [[Dabie Mountains]] divides [[Hubei]] from Henan. The [[Nanyang Basin]], separated from North China Plain by these mountains, is another important agricultural and population center, with culture and history distinct from the rest of Henan and closer to that of Hubei's. Unlike the rest of northern China, [[desertification]] is not a problem in Henan, though sandstorms are common in cities near the Yellow River due to the large amount of sand present in the river. At 2413.8 meters above sea level, the highest point in Henan province is Laoyachanao ({{lang|zh|老鸦岔垴}}).<ref>{{Cite web |language=zh|url=http://dy.163.com/v2/article/detail/CTSRLRBH0524E1T0.html |title=河南山峰海拔排名，第一谁也没想到，你都去过几座？_网易订阅 |access-date=8 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408141523/http://dy.163.com/v2/article/detail/CTSRLRBH0524E1T0.html |archive-date=8 April 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Yellow River passes through central Henan. It enters from the northwest, via the [[Sanmenxia Reservoir]]. After it passes Luoyang, the mountains gave way to plains. Excessive amount of sediments are formed due to the silt it picks up from the Loess Plateau, raising the river bed and causing frequent floods which shaped the habitat of the region. More recently however, construction of dams and [[levee]]s, as well as the depletion of water resources have ended the floods. The [[Huai River]] in southern Henan is another important river, and has been recognized as part of the boundary dividing [[Northern and southern China|northern and southern Chinese climate and culture]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=淮河 |url=http://www.mwr.gov.cn/szs/hl/201612/t20161222_776385.html |access-date=2024-04-01 |website=www.mwr.gov.cn|language=zh}}</ref>

Henan shares borders with six other provinces. It is bordered to the west by [[Shaanxi]], to the south by [[Hubei]], and to the north by [[Shanxi]] (northwest) and [[Hebei]] (northeast). To the east lie [[Shandong]] (northeast) and [[Anhui]] (southeast), whose borders meet at a narrow strip of land which separates Henan from [[Jiangsu]] to the east.

===Climate===
Henan has a [[temperate]] climate that is [[humid subtropical]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cwa'' or ''Cfa'') to the south of the Yellow River and bordering on [[humid continental]] (Köppen ''Dwa'') to the north. It has a distinct seasonal climate characterised by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian [[monsoon]], and generally cool to cold, windy, dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian [[anticyclone]]. Temperatures average around the freezing mark in January and 27 to 28&nbsp;°C in July. A great majority of the annual rainfall occurs during the summer.

==Administrative divisions==
{{further|List of administrative divisions of Henan|List of township-level divisions of Henan}}
Henan is divided into seventeen [[prefecture-level division]]s: all [[Prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]]; along with one directly administered [[county-level city]] (a [[sub-prefecture-level city]]):

With a population of approximately 93.6&nbsp;million, Henan is the third most populous Chinese province after Guangdong and Shandong. It is also the fifth most populous sub-national division in the world. If it were a country by itself, it would be the twelfth most populous in the world, just behind Mexico and ahead of the Philippines. However, the [[hukou system]] shows Henan as the most populous province in China with over 103&nbsp;million people, as it counts the migrant Henanese laborers as residents of Henan, instead of the province they currently reside in. On the other hand, Guangdong is shown as having only 81&nbsp;million people, though the actual population is 95&nbsp;million due to the influx of migrants from other provinces.

The population is highly homogeneous with 98.8% of the population being [[Han Chinese|Han]]. Small populations of [[Mongols]] and [[Manchus]] exists in scattered rural communities as well as major urban centers.
Along with [[Jiangxi]], Henan has one of the most unbalanced gender ratios in China. As a result of the Chinese government's [[one-child policy]] (many parents do not want the only child to be female and abort the fetus), the gender ratio was 118.46 males for 100 females in 2000. Subsequently, aborting fetuses due to their female sex was banned in Henan and heavy fines are issued for those who violate the law. In addition, daughter-only families receive an annual allowance from the government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200609/30/eng20060930_307662.html|title=China's most populous province legislates to curb gender imbalance|last=|access-date=23 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914152026/http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200609/30/eng20060930_307662.html|archive-date=14 September 2011|url-status=live|work=[[People's Daily Online]]}}</ref> Despite these efforts the problem seems to have become far worse.

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Henan|List of current Chinese provincial leaders}}
The Government of Henan is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.

The [[Governor of Henan]] is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Henan. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Henan [[Chinese Communist Party]] Provincial Committee Secretary, colloquially termed the "Henan [[Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary|CCP Party Chief]]".

==Economy==
[[File:View near Caizhai, Xiping, Zhumadian.jpg|thumb|Farmland in [[Xiping County]], [[Zhumadian]]]]
Henan has seen rapid development in its economy over the past two decades, and its economy has expanded at an even faster rate than the national average of&nbsp;10%. This rapid growth has transformed Henan from one of the poorest provinces to one that matches other central provinces.

Henan is the [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP|5th-largest provincial economy]] of China, the second largest in [[South Central China]] after Guangdong, the largest in [[Central China]] and the largest among inland provinces, with a nominal GDP of 5.88&nbsp;trillion RMB (US$926&nbsp;billion) as of 2021, ahead of the GDP of Turkey of 815 billion.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" /> If it were a country, it would be the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|18th-largest economy]] as well as the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|14th most populous]] as of 2021.<ref name=":1" /> However, [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita|per capita GDP]] is low compared to other eastern and central provinces.<ref name=":3" />

Henan is a semi-industrialized economy with an underdeveloped [[service sector]]. Agriculture has traditionally been a pillar of its economy, with the nation's highest wheat and [[sesame]] output and second highest rice output, earning its reputation as the breadbasket of China. Henan is also an important producer of beef, cotton, maize, pork, [[animal oil]], and corn.

Although Henan's industry has traditionally been based on [[light textiles]] and [[food processing]], recent developments have diversified the industry sector to [[metallurgy]], petrol, cement, [[chemical industry]], [[machinery]] and [[electronics]].

==Transportation==

Henan has some of the most advanced transportation system in China due to its flat terrain and its location at the heart of [[Rise of Central China|central China's construction boom]]. The [[Jingguang Railway|Jingguang]] and [[Longhai Railway]], the nation's two most important railways, run through much of the province and intersect at [[Zhengzhou]]. Other railway hubs such as [[Shangqiu]], [[Xinxiang]], and [[Luohe]] have also become important centers of trade and manufacturing as a result. Zhengzhou is also an important hub of China's [[high-speed rail]]way network with railway lines connecting the city from 8 directions with all preferecture-level cities in Henan and other important cities in the country. [[Zhengzhou East Railway Station]] is one of the largest high speed railway stations in China and the world. Henan's expressway system is highly developed and the total length is approximately {{convert|5000|km|abbr=on}}, the highest total for any Chinese province. The state of air transport is less stellar, the only 3 public airports are located in [[Xinzheng]] (near Zhengzhou), [[Luoyang]], and [[Nanyang, Henan|Nanyang]].

==Culture==
{{main|Zhongyuan culture}}
* Most of Henan speaks dialects of the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] group of dialects spoken in northern and southwestern China. Linguists put these dialects into the category of "[[Zhongyuan Mandarin]]". The northwestern corner of Henan is an exception, where people speak [[Jin Chinese|Jin]] dialects instead. The dialects of Henan are collectively called "the [[Henan dialect]]" in popular usage, with easily identifiable stereotypical features.
*[[Yu opera]] is the local form of [[Chinese opera]]; it is also well-known and popular across the rest of China. [[Henan Quju]] and [[Henan Yuediao]] are also important local opera forms.
*[[Henan cuisine]] is the local cuisine, with traditions such as the [[Water Banquet|Luoyang Shuixi]] ([[Luoyang]] "Water Table", consisting entirely of various soups, etc.); [[Xinyang Duncai]] ([[Xinyang]] brewed vegetables), and the traditional [[Kaifeng cuisine]].
*Important traditional art and craft products include: [[Junci]], a type of porcelain originating in [[Yuzhou City|Yuzhou]] noted for its unpredictable colour patterns; the [[jade carving]]s of [[Zhenping County, Henan|Zhenping]]; and [[Luoyang]]'s [[Tangsancai]] ("Tang Three Colours"), which are earthenware figurines made in the traditional style of the [[Tang dynasty]].

==Tourism==
Henan is located in the Yellow River valley where ancient people lived. Intricate pottery, writing and musical instruments of the [[Peiligang Culture]] and [[Yangshao Culture]] arose during [[neolithic]] times. Three of the [[Seven Ancient Capitals of China]] are in Henan: [[Luoyang]], [[Kaifeng]] and [[Anyang]]. 16 historical sites in Henan are [[Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level|protected at the national level]] and 267 more at the provincial level.
