==Geography==
Tama is located in the foothills of the Okutama Mountains of southwestern Tokyo, known as [[Tama Hills]], which spans Tokyo and [[Kanagawa Prefecture]]. The entire region is historically referred to as Tama; therefore there are many place names scattered throughout the area with references to the name "Tama" which are not within the city limits. The [[Tama River]] marks the city's northern boundary, and Kanagawa Prefecture is to the south. Its southern half forms part of the [[Tama New Town]] project, Japan's largest residential development, constructed in the 1970s.

==History==
* The area of present-day Tama was part of ancient [[Musashi Province]]. In the post-[[Meiji Restoration]] cadastral reform of July 22, 1878, the area became part of [[Minamitama District, Tokyo|Minamitama District]] in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]].
* Tama Village was founded on April 1, 1889 from the merger of 11 pre-[[Meiji period]] hamlets with the establishment of the modern municipalities system.
* Minamitama District was transferred to the administrative control of Tokyo Metropolis on April 1, 1893.
* Tama was elevated to town status on April 1, 1964. Construction of [[Tama New Town]] began in 1966, and the first occupants started moving in 1971.
* On November 1, 1971, Tama Town was reclassified as Tama City, dissolving Minamitama District. Tama was the last town in the former Minamitama District.

==Government==
Tama has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 26 members.
