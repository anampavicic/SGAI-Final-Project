'''Sicily''' ({{langx|it|Sicilia}}, {{IPA|it|siˈtʃiːlja|lang|LL-Q652 (ita)-LangPao-Sicilia.wav}}; {{langx|scn|Sicilia}}, {{IPA|scn|sɪˈ(t)ʃiːlja|lang|LL-Q33973 (scn)-XANA000-Sicilia.wav}}; officially ''Regione Siciliana'') is an island in the central [[Mediterranean Sea]], south of the [[Italian Peninsula]] in [[continental Europe]] and is one of the 20 [[regions of Italy|regions]] of [[Italy]]. With 4.8 million inhabitants, including 1.3 million in and around the capital city of [[Palermo]], it is the most populous island in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It is named after the [[Sicels]], who inhabited the eastern part of the island during the [[Iron Age]]. Sicily has a rich and unique culture in [[#Art and architecture|arts]], [[Music of Sicily|music]], [[#Literature|literature]], [[Sicilian cuisine|cuisine]], and [[Sicilian Baroque|architecture]]. Its most prominent landmark is [[Mount Etna]], the tallest active [[volcano]] in Europe, and one of the most active in the world, currently {{convert|3357|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high. The island has a typical [[Mediterranean climate]]. It is separated from [[Calabria]] by the [[Strait of Messina]]. It is one of the five [[Regions of Italy#Autonomous regions with special statute|Italian autonomous regions]] and is generally considered part of [[Southern Italy]].

The earliest [[archaeological record]] of human activity on the island is from around 14,000 BC. By around 750 BC, Sicily had three [[Phoenicia]]n and a dozen [[Greeks in Italy|Greek colonies]] along its coasts, becoming one of the centers of [[Magna Graecia]]. The [[Sicilian Wars]] of 580–265 BC were fought between the Carthaginians and Greeks, and the [[Punic Wars]] of 264–146 BC were fought between Rome and Carthage. The Roman province of [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicilia]] ended with the fall of the [[Roman Empire]] in the 5th century AD. Sicily was ruled during the [[Early Middle Ages]] by the [[Vandals]], the [[Ostrogoths]], the [[Byzantine Empire]], and the [[Emirate of Sicily]].

The [[Norman conquest of southern Italy]] led to the creation of the [[County of Sicily]] in 1071, that was succeeded by [[Kingdom of Sicily]], a state that existed from 1130 until 1816 under various dynasties,<ref>Pasquale Hamel – L' invenzione del regno. Dalla conquista normanna alla fondazione del Regnum Siciliae (1061–1154)</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Sicilia nell'Enciclopedia Treccani |url=https://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/sicilia_res-51b7c2ab-973b-11e5-8844-00271042e8d9 |access-date=22 December 2020|website=www.treccani.it|language=it-IT}}</ref> and in 1816 it was unified with the [[Kingdom of Naples]] into the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]].  From the 1282 [[Sicilian Vespers]] until the 1860 [[Expedition of the Thousand]], Sicily was ruled by [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] and then [[Spain]], either in [[personal union]] with the crown or by a [[cadet branch]], with the exception of a period of [[House of Savoy|Savoy]] and then [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] rule in 1713–1735.

The island became part of the [[Unification of Italy|newly unified]] [[Italy]] in 1860 following the Expedition of the Thousand, an invasion led by [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], and a plebiscite. Sicily was given special status as an [[autonomous administrative division]] on 15 May 1946, 18 days before the [[1946 Italian institutional referendum]].

==Geography==
{{See also|Geology of Sicily}}
[[File:Sicily Map.png|thumb|left|Sicily]]

Sicily has a roughly triangular shape, earning it the name ''Trinacria''.

To the north-east, it is separated from [[Calabria]] and the rest of the Italian mainland by the [[Strait of Messina]], about {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide in the north, and about {{convert|16|km|abbr=on}} wide in the southern part.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/542800/Sicily Britannica – Travel & Geography – Sicily] Italian Sicilia – retrieved 11 May 2010.</ref> The northern and southern coasts are each about {{convert|280|km|abbr=on}} long measured as a straight line, while the eastern coast measures around {{convert|180|km|abbr=on}}; total coast length is [[Length of coast|estimated]] at {{convert|1484|km|abbr=on}}. The total area of the island is {{convert|25711|km2|abbr=on}},<ref name=eb>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sicily |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Sicily}}</ref> while the [[Autonomous administrative division|Autonomous Region]] of Sicily (which includes the smaller surrounding islands of [[Lipari]], [[Egadi]], [[Ustica]], and [[Pantelleria]]) has an area of {{convert|27708|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://oxcon.ouplaw.com/display/10.1093/law:ocw/law-ocw-cm393.document.1/law-ocw-cm393 | title=The Autonomous Region of Sicily: Introductory Note | first=Philip | last=Raworth | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=2007}}</ref>

The terrain of inland Sicily is mostly hilly and is intensively cultivated wherever possible. Along the northern coast, the [[mountain range]]s of [[Madonie]], {{convert|2000|m|abbr=on}}, [[Nebrodi]], {{convert|1800|m|abbr=on}}, and [[Peloritani]], {{convert|1300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, are an extension of the mainland [[Apennines]]. The cone of [[Mount Etna]] dominates the eastern coast.

Sicily and its surrounding small islands have some highly active volcanoes. This is due to Sicily being geographically on the northern edge of the [[African Plate]].<ref>{{Cite journal |date=1 May 1974 |title=Evolution of a section of the Africa-Europe plate boundary: Paleomagnetic and volcanological evidence from Sicily |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0012821X74900727|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |language=en |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=123–132 |doi=10.1016/0012-821X(74)90072-7|issn=0012-821X |last1=Barberi |first1=F. |last2=Civetta |first2=L. |last3=Gasparini |first3=P. |last4=Innocenti |first4=F. |last5=Scandone |first5=R. |last6=Villari |first6=L. |bibcode=1974E&PSL..22..123B}}</ref> Mount Etna is the largest active volcano in Europe and casts black ash over the island with its recurrent eruptions.

The [[Aeolian Islands]] in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], to the northeast of mainland Sicily form a volcanic complex.

The three volcanoes of [[Vulcano]], [[Stromboli]] and [[Lipari]] are also active, although the last is usually dormant. Off the southern coast of Sicily, the underwater volcano of [[Ferdinandea]], which is part of the larger [[Empedocles (volcano)|Empedocles volcano]], last erupted in 1831. It is located between the coast of [[Agrigento]] and the island of [[Pantelleria]] (which itself is a dormant volcano).

From a geographical perspective, also forming a part of Sicily is the Maltese Archipelago, the islands home to the [[republic of Malta]].

The [[Autonomous administrative division|autonomous region]] also includes several neighbouring islands: the [[Aegadian Islands]], the Aeolian Islands, Pantelleria and [[Lampedusa]].

=== Mountains ===
[[File:Mt Etna and Catania1.jpg|thumb|Mount Etna rising over suburbs of Catania]]
[[File:Sguardo sul Parco Monti Sicani.jpg|thumb|The [[Monti Sicani]] in western Sicily]]

The mountains of Sicily form a significant part of the island's diverse landscape, with [[Mount Etna]], one of the world's most active volcanoes, being the highest and most notable peak. Other important mountain ranges include the [[Nebrodi]], [[Madonie]] and [[Peloritani]] mountains ranges.

Several rivers [[drainage|drain]] the island, most of which flow through the central area and enter the sea at the south of the island. The [[Salso]] flows through parts of Enna and Caltanissetta before entering the [[Mediterranean Sea]] at the [[port]] of [[Licata]]. To the east, the [[Alcantara (river)|Alcantara]] flows through the province of [[Messina]] and enters the sea at [[Giardini Naxos]], and the [[Simeto]], which flows into the [[Ionian Sea]] south of [[Catania]]. Other important rivers on the island are the [[Belice]] and [[Platani (river)|Platani]] in the southwest.

===Climate===
[[File:Veduta-Vallone-Caltanissetta.jpg|thumb|Inner Sicily]]

Sicily has for the most part a typical [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Csa'') with mild and wet winters and hot, dry summers with changeable intermediate seasons. On the coasts, especially in the southwest, the climate is affected by the African currents and summers can be hot.

Snow falls above 900 metres, but it can fall in the hills. The interior mountains, especially [[Nebrodi]], [[Madonie]], and [[Mount Etna|Etna]], enjoy a mountain climate, with heavy snowfalls during winter. The summit of Mount Etna is usually snow-capped from October to May.

In the summer, the [[sirocco]] – the wind from the Sahara – can be felt. Rainfall is scarce, and in some provinces a water crisis can occur.

According to the Regional Agency for Waste and Water, on 10 August 1999, the weather station of [[Catenanuova]] (EN) recorded an unofficial maximum temperature of {{convert|48.5|C|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Agenzia Regionale per i Rifiuti e le Acque|publisher=Osservatorio delle Acque|url=http://www.osservatorioacque.it/dati/ANNALI/A_1999/PI_80.HTML|access-date=14 October 2010|archive-date=22 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722043903/http://www.osservatorioacque.it/dati/ANNALI/A_1999/PI_80.HTML|url-status=dead}}</ref> On 11 August 2021, a new [[List of weather records|highest temperature record]] for [[Europe]] with a reading of {{Convert|48.8|C|F}} was set near the city of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-07-17 |title=WMO is monitoring potential new temperature records |url=https://wmo.int/media/news/wmo-monitoring-potential-new-temperature-records |access-date=2023-07-17 |website=public.wmo.int |language=en}}</ref> Total precipitation is highly variable, generally increasing with elevation. In general, the southern and southeast coast receives the least rainfall (less than {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}}), and the northern and northeastern highlands the most (over {{convert|100|cm|in|abbr=on}}).

Sicily is an often-quoted example of man-made [[deforestation]], which has occurred since Roman times when the island was turned into an agricultural region.<ref name="frommers" /> This gradually dried the climate, leading to a decline in rainfall and the drying of rivers. The central and southwest provinces are practically devoid of forest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bestofsicily.com/mag/art51.htm|title=A Sicilian Desert?|first=Carlo|last=Trabia|publisher=Best of Sicily Magazine|year=2002}}</ref> In Northern Sicily, there are three important forests; near Mount Etna, in the [[Nebrodi|Nebrodi Mountains]] and in the [[Bosco della Ficuzza]] Natural Reserve near [[Palermo]]. The Nebrodi Mountains Regional Park, established on 4 August 1993 and covering {{convert|86000|ha|acre}}, is the largest protected natural area of Sicily; it contains the largest forest in Sicily, the [[Caronia]].

{{Main|History of Sicily}}

The name ''[[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicilia]]'' was given to the [[Roman province]] in 241 BC. It is named after the [[Sicels]], who inhabited the eastern part of the island during the [[Iron Age]]. The ancient name of the island is ''Trinacria'' (Greek [[:wikt:Τρινακρία|Τρινακρία]] "having three headlands") for its triangular shape, likely a re-interpretation of earlier ([[Homeric Greek|Homeric]]) ''[[Thrinacia]]''. The Greek name was rendered as ''Trīnācrĭa'' in [[classical Latin]] ([[Virgil]], [[Ovid]]).<ref>Cassell's Latin Dictionary, Marchant, J.R.V, & Charles, Joseph F., (Eds.), Revised Edition, 1928</ref><ref>"Sicilian Culture: The Folklore, Legends & Traditions: Trinacria."

The original classical-era inhabitants of Sicily comprised three defined groups of the [[List of ancient peoples of Italy|ancient peoples of Italy]]: the [[Sicani]], the [[Elymians]] and the [[Sicels]]. The most prominent and by far the earliest of these were the [[Sicani]], who ([[Thucydides]] writes) arrived from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (perhaps [[Catalonia]]).<ref>{{cite news | url=https://antropocene.it/en/2023/06/05/the-sicani-and-agriculture/ | title=The Sicani and agriculture | work=Antropocene | date=5 June 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=7 October 2007 |title=Aapologetico de la literatura española contra los opiniones |publisher=Ensayo historico |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7kGAAAAQAAJ&q=segre+sicano&pg=PA11}}</ref> Some modern scholars, however, suggest classifying the Sicani as possibly an [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribe.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Fine |first=John Van Antwerp |url=https://archive.org/details/ancientgreeks00john |title=The Ancient Greeks: A Critical History |date=1983 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674033146 |page=[https://archive.org/details/ancientgreeks00john/page/72 72] |language=en |quote=most scholars now believe that the sicans and Sicels, as well as the. |url-access=registration}}</ref> Important historical evidence has been discovered in the form of cave drawings by the Sicani, dated from the end of the [[Pleistocene]] epoch around 8000 BC.<ref name="sicanian">{{cite news |date=7 October 2007 |title=Sicilian Peoples: The Sicanians |publisher=Best of Sicily |url=http://www.bestofsicily.com/mag/art141.htm}}</ref> The [[Elymians]], thought to have come from the area of the [[Aegean Sea]], became the next tribe to join the Sicanians on Sicily.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sicani |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9067615/Sicani |date=7 October 2007}}</ref>

No evidence survives of warring between tribes, but the Sicanians moved eastwards when the Elymians settled in the northwest corner of the island. The [[Sicels]] are thought<ref name="sicanian" /> to have originated in [[Liguria]]; they arrived from mainland Italy in 1200 BC and forced the Sicanians to move back across Sicily and to settle in the middle of the island.<ref name="sicanian" /> Other minor [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Italic groups]] who settled in Sicily included the [[Ausones]] ([[Aeolian Islands]], [[Milazzo]]) and the [[Morgetes]] of [[Morgantina]].

The [[Phoenicia]]n settlements in the western part of the island predate the arrival of [[Greek people|Greek]] colonists.<ref name="catholi" /> From about 750 BC, the Greeks began to live in Sicily ({{langx |grc| Σικελία}} – ''Sikelia''), establishing many significant settlements. The most important colony was in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]; others grew up at [[Agrigentum|Akragas]], [[Selinunte]], [[Gela]], [[Himera]] and [[Messina|Zancle]].<ref>E. Zuppardo-S.Piccolo, ''Terra Mater: sulle sponde del Gela greco'', Betania Ed., Caltanissetta 2005</ref> The native Sicani and Sicel peoples became [[Cultural assimilation|absorbed]] into the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic culture]] with relative ease, and the area became part of [[Magna Graecia]] along with the coasts of the [[southern Italy|south of the Italian peninsula]], which the Greeks had also colonised. Sicily had fertile soils, and the successful introduction of [[olive]]s and [[grape vine]]s fostered profitable trading.<ref name="knowital" /> [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]] significantly included [[Religion in ancient Greece|Greek religion]], and the settlers built many [[Ancient Greek temple|temple]]s throughout Sicily, including several in the ''Valley of the Temples'' at [[Agrigento]].<ref>{{cite news|url= http://italiansrus.com/articles/temples.htm|publisher= Italiansrus.com|title= Valley of the Temples|date= 7 October 2007}}</ref>

Politics on the island became intertwined with those of Greece; [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] became desired by the [[Athenian]]s who set out on the [[Sicilian Expedition]] (415–413 BC) during the [[Peloponnesian War]]. Syracuse gained [[Sparta]] and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] as allies and, as a result, defeated the Athenian expedition. The victors destroyed the Athenian army and their ships, selling most of the survivors into [[Slavery in ancient Greece|slavery]].<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.livius.org/su-sz/syracuse/siege.html|publisher= Livius.org|title= Siege of Syracuse|date= 7 October 2007|access-date= 26 March 2020|archive-date= 7 November 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161107071518/http://www.livius.org/su-sz/syracuse/siege.html|url-status= dead}}</ref>

In the [[Second Punic War]] (218 to 201 BC), the Carthaginians attempted to recapture Sicily. Some of the Greek cities on the island sided with the Carthaginians.

Various groups used the island as a power base at different times: slave insurgents occupied it during the [[first Servile War|First]] (135−132 BC) and [[Second Servile War|Second]] (104−100 BC) [[Servile Wars]]. [[Sextus Pompey]] had his headquarters there during the [[War between Sextus Pompey and the Second Triumvirate|Sicilian revolt]] of 44 to 36 BC.

=== Germanic rule (469–535) ===
The [[Western Roman Empire]] began falling apart after the invasion of [[Vandals]], Alans, and Sueves [[Crossing of the Rhine|across the Rhine]] on the last day of 406. Eventually the Vandals, after roaming about western and southern [[Hispania]] (present-day [[Iberia]]) for 20 years, moved to North Africa in 429 and occupied Carthage in 439. The Franks moved south from present-day Belgium. The Visigoths moved west and eventually settled in Aquitaine in 418; the Burgundians settled in present-day Savoy in 443.

The Vandals found themselves in a position to threaten Sicily – only 100 miles away from their North African bases.<ref name="jpriv">{{cite book|last=Privitera|first=John|title=Sicily: An Illustrated History|publisher=Hippocrene Books|url=https://archive.org/details/sicilyillustrate00priv|isbn=978-0-7818-0909-2|year=2002}}</ref> After taking Carthage, the Vandals, personally led by King [[Gaiseric]], laid siege to Palermo in 440 as the opening act in an attempt to wrest the island from Roman rule.<ref>J.B.

After taking areas occupied by the Vandals in North Africa, [[Justinian I]] retook Italy as an ambitious attempt to recover the lost provinces in the West. The re-conquests marked an end to over 150 years of accommodationist policies with tribal invaders.

Palermo was initially ruled by the [[Aghlabids]]; later it was the centre of the Emirate of Sicily, which was under the nominal suzerainty of the [[Fatimid Caliphate]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} During the reign of this dynasty revolts by Byzantine Sicilians continuously occurred especially in the east where Greek-speaking Christians predominated. Parts of the island were re-occupied before revolts were quashed. Under the Arab rule the island was divided in [[three valli of Sicily|three administrative regions]], or "vals", roughly corresponding to the three "points" of Sicily: [[Val di Mazara]] in the west; [[Val Demone]] in the northeast; and [[Val di Noto]] in the southeast. As [[dhimmi]]s, that is as members of a protected class of approved monotheists, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christians]] were allowed [[freedom of religion]], but had to pay a tax, the [[jizya]] (in lieu of the obligatory alms tax, the [[zakat]], paid by Muslims), and were restricted from active participation in public affairs. By the 11th century, the [[Emirate of Sicily]] began to fragment as intra-dynastic quarreling fractured the Muslim government.<ref name="stan" />

===Norman Sicily (1038–1198)===

In 1038, seventy years after losing their last cities in Sicily, the Byzantines under the Greek general [[George Maniakes]] invaded the island together with their [[Varangian guard|Varangian]] and [[Normans|Norman]] mercenaries. Maniakes was killed in a Byzantine civil war in 1043 before completing a reconquest and the Byzantines withdrew. Later the Normans invaded in 1061 and after taking [[Apulia]] and [[Calabria]], [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger I]] occupied [[Messina]] with an army of 700 knights.<ref name="stan" /><ref name="Boise State University Sicily under the ormans">[https://web.archive.org/web/20091001173814/http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/crusades/Europe/italy/02.shtml "Italy during the Crusades – Sicily under the Normans"] – History of the Crusades – Boise State University – Retrieved 15 July 2011.</ref> In 1068, Roger I was victorious at [[Battle of Misilmeri|Misilmeri]]. Most crucial was the siege of Palermo, whose fall in 1071 eventually resulted in all Sicily coming under Norman control.<ref name="initalymag" /> The conquest was completed in 1091 when they captured [[Noto]] the last Arab stronghold. Palermo continued to be the capital under the [[Normans]]. The Normans formed a small but violent ruling class. They destroyed many of the Arab towns in Sicily, and very few physical remains survive from the Arab era.<ref name="stan" />

The Norman [[Hauteville family]] appreciated and admired the rich and layered culture in which they now found themselves. They also introduced into Sicily their own culture, customs, and politics from [[Normandy]]. Many Normans in Sicily adopted the habits and comportment of Muslim rulers and their Byzantine subjects in dress, language, literature, even to the extent of having palace [[eunuch]]s and, according to some accounts, a harem.<ref>{{cite book|last=Johns|first=Jeremy|year=2002|title=Arabic Administration in Norman Sicily: The Royal Diwan|series=Cambridge studies in Islamic civilization|location=Cambridge, England|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pXXYfJ9woRwC&pg=PA249 249–250]|isbn=978-0-521-81692-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Takayama|first=Hiroshi|year=1993|title=The Administration of the Norman Kingdom of Sicily|location=Leiden, the Netherlands|publisher=E.J.

While Roger I died in 1101, his wife [[Adelaide del Vasto|Adelaide]] ruled until 1112 when their son [[Roger II of Sicily]] came of age.<ref name="Boise State University Sicily under the ormans" /> Having succeeded his brother [[Simon of Sicily|Simon]] as Count of Sicily, Roger II was ultimately able to raise the status of the island to a kingdom in 1130, along with his other holdings, which included the [[Maltese Islands]] and the Duchies of [[Duchy of Apulia|Apulia]] and [[Duchy of Calabria|Calabria]].<ref name="initalymag">{{cite news|url=http://www.initaly.com/regions/sicily/chronol.htm|publisher=In Italy Magazine|title=Chronological – Historical Table of Sicily|date=7 October 2007|access-date=12 December 2007|archive-date=27 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727225426/http://www.initaly.com/regions/sicily/chronol.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aboutmalta.com/history/time-Line.htm|publisher=AboutMalta.com|title=Classical and Medieval Malta (60–1530)|date=7 October 2007}}</ref>

Roger II appointed the powerful Greek [[George of Antioch]] to be his "emir of emirs" and continued the syncretism of his father. During this period, the Kingdom of Sicily was prosperous and politically powerful, becoming one of the wealthiest states in all of Europe—even wealthier than the [[Kingdom of England]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|author-link=John Julius Norwich|title=The Normans in Sicily: The Normans in the South 1016–1130 and the Kingdom in the Sun 1130–1194|publisher=Penguin Global|isbn=978-0-14-015212-8|year=1992}}</ref>

The court of Roger II became the most luminous centre of culture in the Mediterranean, both from Europe and the Middle East, like the multi-ethnic [[Caliphate of Córdoba]], then only just eclipsed. This attracted scholars, scientists, poets, artists, and artisans of all kinds. Laws were issued in the language of the community to whom they were addressed in Norman Sicily, at the time when the culture was still heavily Arab and Greek.<ref name="Advanced Studies in Cultural History" /><ref name="Loud, G.

However this situation changed as the Normans imported immigrants from [[Normandy]], [[England]], Lombardy, Piedmont, Provence and [[Campania]] to secure the island. Linguistically, the island shifted from being one-third Greek- and two-thirds Arabic-speaking at the time of the Norman conquest to becoming fully [[Linguistic Latinisation|Latinised]].<ref name="Loud, G. A. 2007 494" /> In terms of religion the island became completely Roman Catholic (bearing in mind that until 1054 the Churches owing allegiance to the Pope and the Patriarch of Constantinople belonged to one Church); Sicily before the Norman conquest was under the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bestofsicily.com/mag/art171.htm |publisher=BestofSicily.com |title=Sicilian Peoples: The Normans|date=7 October 2007}}</ref> After Pope Innocent III made him Papal Legate in 1098, Roger I created several Catholic bishoprics while still allowing the construction of 12 Greek-speaking monasteries (the Greek language, monasteries, and 1500 parishes continued to exist until the adherents of the Greek Rite were forced in 1585 to convert to Catholicism or leave; a small pocket of Greek-speakers still live in Messina).

===Kingdom of Sicily (1198–1860)===
{{Main|Kingdom of Sicily|List of monarchs of Sicily}}

After a century, the Norman [[Hauteville family|Hauteville]] dynasty died out; the last direct descendant and heir of Roger II, [[Constance of Sicily|Constance]], married [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry VI]].<ref name="dieli" /> This eventually led to the crown of Sicily being passed to the [[Hohenstaufen]] dynasty, who were Germans from [[Swabia]]. The last of the Hohenstaufens, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], the only son of [[Constance of Sicily|Constance]], was one of the greatest and most cultured men of the Middle Ages. His mother's will had asked [[Pope Innocent III]] to undertake the guardianship of her son.  Frederick was four when at [[Palermo]], he was crowned [[King of Sicily]] in 1198. Frederick received no systematic education and was allowed to run free in the streets of [[Palermo]]. There he picked up the many languages he heard spoken, such as Arabic and Greek, and learned some of the lore of the Jewish community. At age twelve, he dismissed Innocent's deputy regent and took over the government; at fifteen he married [[Constance of Aragon]], and began his reclamation of the imperial crown. Subsequently, due to Muslim rebellions, Frederick II destroyed the remaining Muslim presence in Sicily, estimated at 60,000 people, moving all to the city of Lucera in Apulia between 1221 and 1226.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=weluAAAAQBAJ|title=Muslims in Medieval Italy: The Colony at Lucera|first=Julie|last=Taylor|date=19 August 2003|publisher=Lexington Books|via=Google Books|isbn=9780739157978}}</ref>

Conflict between the Hohenstaufen house and the [[Papacy]] led, in 1266, to [[Pope Innocent IV]] crowning the [[Capetian House of Anjou|French prince]] [[Charles I of Naples|Charles]], [[count of Anjou]] and [[County of Provence|Provence]], as the king of both Sicily and Naples.<ref name="dieli" />

Strong opposition to French officialdom due to mistreatment and taxation saw the local peoples of Sicily rise up, leading in 1282 to an [[insurrection]] known as the [[War of the Sicilian Vespers]], which eventually saw almost the entire French population on the island killed.<ref name="dieli" /> During the war, the Sicilians turned to [[Peter III of Aragon]], son-in-law of the last Hohenstaufen king, for support after being rejected by the Pope. Peter gained control of Sicily from the French, who, however, retained control of the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. A crusade was launched in August 1283 against Peter III and the Crown of Aragon by [[Pope Martin IV]] (a pope from [[Île-de-France]]), but it failed. The wars continued until the [[peace of Caltabellotta]] in 1302, which saw Peter's son [[Frederick III of Sicily|Frederick III]] recognized as the king of the Isle of Sicily, while [[Charles II of Naples|Charles II]] was recognized as the king of Naples by [[Pope Boniface VIII]].<ref name="dieli" /> Sicily was ruled as an independent kingdom by relatives of the kings of Aragon until 1409 and then as part of the [[Crown of Aragon]].<ref name="knowital" />

In October 1347, in Messina, Sicily, the [[Black Death]] first arrived in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/spread-of-the-black-death-through-europe-4123214 |first=Melissa |last=Snell |date=July 30, 2019 |title=The Arrival and Spread of the Black Plague in Europe |website=ThoughtCo |access-date=24 January 2024}}</ref>

Between the 15th and 18th centuries, waves of [[Greeks]] from the [[Peloponnese]] (such as the [[Maniots]]) and [[Arvanites]] migrated to Sicily in large numbers to escape persecution after the [[Ottoman conquest of the Balkans|Ottoman conquest of the Peloponnese]].

The onset of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in 1492 led to [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II]] decreeing the expulsion of all Jews from Sicily.<ref name="dieli" /> The eastern part of the island was hit by destructive earthquakes in 1542 and 1693.

However, the advent of [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]]'s [[First French Empire]] saw Naples taken at the [[Battle of Campo Tenese]] and Bonapartist [[King of Naples]] was installed. [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand III]], the Bourbon, was forced to retreat to Sicily which he was still in control of with the help of [[Royal Navy|British naval]] protection.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.clash-of-steel.co.uk/pages/battle_details.php?battle=CAMPOTENES01|publisher=Clash-of-Steel.co.uk|title=Campo Tenese|date=7 October 2007}}</ref>

Following this, Sicily joined the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and subsequently the British under [[Lord William Bentinck]] established a military and diplomatic presence on the island to protect against a French invasion. Sicilian volunteers joined the British military to form the [[Royal Sicilian Regiment]], which saw action at the [[Battle of Maida]] and then transferred to [[Peninsular War|Iberia]]. After the wars were won, Sicily and Naples formally merged as the [[Two Sicilies]] under the Bourbons. Major [[revolutionary]] movements occurred in 1820 and 1848 against the Bourbon government with Sicily seeking independence; the second of which, the [[Sicilian revolution of independence of 1848|1848 revolution]] resulted in a short period of independence for Sicily. However, in 1849 the Bourbons retook control of the island and dominated it until 1860.<ref>[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/regno-delle-due-sicilie/ Regno Delle Due Sicilie nell'Enciclopedia Treccani].

The Sicilian economy (and the wider ''[[mezzogiorno]]'' economy) remained relatively underdeveloped after the [[Italian unification]], in spite of the strong investments made by the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in terms of modern infrastructure, and this caused an unprecedented [[Italian diaspora|wave of emigration]].<ref name="modern">{{cite news|url=http://www.oah.org/pubs/magazine/migrations/townsend.html|publisher=OAH.org|title=Italians around the World: Teaching Italian Migration from a Transnational Perspective|date=7 October 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127225428/http://oah.org/pubs/magazine/migrations/townsend.html|archive-date=27 November 2010}}</ref> In 1894, organisations of workers and peasants known as the ''[[Fasci Siciliani]]'' protested against the bad social and economic conditions of the island, but they were suppressed in a few days.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.geocities.com/capitolHill/rotunda/2209/Sicily.html|publisher=Capitol Hill|title=Sicily|date=7 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018230534/http://www.geocities.com/capitolHill/rotunda/2209/Sicily.html|archive-date=18 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9033791/fascio-siciliano|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|title=fascio siciliano|date=7 October 2007}}</ref> The [[1908 Messina earthquake|Messina earthquake]] of 28 December 1908 killed more than 80,000 people.<ref>"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1483443/Messina-earthquake-and-tsunami Messina earthquake and tsunami]".

This period was also characterized by the first contact between the [[Sicilian mafia]] (the crime syndicate also known as Cosa Nostra) and the Italian government. The Mafia's origins are still uncertain, but it is generally accepted that it emerged in the 18th century initially in the role of private enforcers hired to protect the property of landowners and merchants from the groups of [[brigands]] (''briganti'') who frequently pillaged the countryside and towns. The battle against the Mafia made by the Kingdom of Italy was controversial and ambiguous. The [[Carabinieri]] (the military police of Italy) and sometimes the [[Regio Esercito|Italian army]] were often involved in fights against the mafia members, but their efforts were frequently useless because of the secret cooperation between the mafia and local government and also because of the weakness of the Italian judicial system.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071111034455/http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Arma/Ieri/Storia/Vista%2Bda/Fascicolo%2B22/01_Fascicolo%2B22.htm Arma dei Carabinieri – Home – L'Arma – Ieri – Storia – Vista da – Fascicolo 22].

As of 2024, 4.75 million people live in Sicily, making it the [[List of regions of Italy#List of regions|fourth most populated region in Italy]]. In the first century after the [[Italian unification]], Sicily had one of the most negative [[net migration rate]]s among the regions of Italy because of the emigration of millions of people to Northern Italy, other European countries, North America, South America and Australia. Like the South of Italy and Sardinia, immigration to the island is very low compared to other regions of Italy because workers tend to head to [[Northern Italy]] instead, due to better employment and industrial opportunities.

Sicilian emigration started shortly after the [[Italian unification]] and has not stopped ever since.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Pitroso |first=Giulio |date=2022 |title=Una prospettiva regionalista su 'Italian Diaspora' e 'Anti-Italianism' in Australia e negli Stati Uniti; A regionalist perspective on 'Italian Diaspora' and 'Anti-Italianism' in Australia and in the United States |url=https://ojs.cimedoc.uniba.it/index.php/nazionieregioni/article/view/1683 |journal=Nazioni e Regioni |issue=19–20 |pages=119–138 |doi=10.15162/2282-5681/1683 |issn=2282-5681}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=December 2021}}. After the [[Italian unification]], Sicily, along with the entire Italian peninsula, has also been strongly marked by [[economic migration|economic emigration]]. Most of the assets of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]'s former national bank, ''[[Banco di Napoli|Banco delle Due Sicilie]]'', were transferred to Piedmont.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.inuovivespri.it/2017/12/09/la-questione-meridionale-3-il-saccheggio-del-banco-delle-due-sicilie/|title=La questione meridionale 3/ Il saccheggio del Banco delle due Sicilie|date=9 December 2017}}</ref> During the first decades of c, a rising number of southern Italian manufactories were driven into ruin due to high taxation imposed by the central government.{{Citation needed|date=December 2021}}

The aforementioned factors, along with a failed land reform, resulted in a never-before-seen wave of Sicilians emigrating, first to the [[United States]] between the 1880s and the 1920s, later to Northern Italy, and from the 1960s onwards also to [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], as well as [[Australia]] and [[South America]].

Today, Sicily is the Italian region with the highest number of [[expatriate]]s: as of 2017, 750,000 Sicilians, 14.4% of the island's population, lived abroad.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.qds.it/26323-disastro-sicilia-in-fuga-i-suoi-figli.htm | title=Disastro Sicilia: In fuga i suoi figli| date=31 October 2017}}</ref>  For lack of employment, every year many Sicilians, especially young graduates, still leave the island to seek jobs abroad.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.lasicilia.it/news/cronaca/12142/emigrazione-fuga-dalla-sicilia-ogni-anno-cancellato-un-paese-di-ventimila-abitanti.html | title=Emigrazione, fuga dalla Sicilia: Ogni anno cancellato un paese di ventimila abitanti| date=29 January 2016}}</ref> Today, an estimated 10&nbsp;million people of Sicilian origins live around the world.

=== Religion ===
{{See also|Italo-Albanian Catholic Church|History of the Jews in Sicily|History of Islam in southern Italy}}
[[File:Sicilia Noto1 tango7174.jpg|thumb|[[Noto Cathedral]]]]
As in most Italian regions, [[Roman Catholicism]] is the predominant religious denomination in Sicily, and the church still plays an important role in the lives of most people. There is also a notable small minority of Eastern-rite [[Byzantine Catholics]] which has a mixed congregation of ethnic [[Albanians]]; it is operated by the [[Italo-Albanian Catholic Church]]. Most people still attend church weekly or at least for religious festivals, and many people get married in churches. There was a wide presence of Jews in Sicily for at least 1,400 years and possibly for more than 2,000 years. Some scholars believe that the Sicilian Jewry are partial ancestors of the [[Ashkenazi Jews]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nebel |year=2001 |doi=10.1086/324070 |title=The Y Chromosome Pool of Jews as Part of the Genetic Landscape of the Middle East |first1=A |last2=Filon |first2=D |last3=Brinkmann |first3=B |last4=Majumder |first4=P |last5=Faerman |first5=M |last6=Oppenheim |first6=A |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=69 |issue=5 |pages=1095–112 |pmid=11573163 |pmc=1274378}}</ref> However, much of the Jewish community faded away when they were [[Expulsion of the Jews from Sicily|expelled from the island]] in 1492. [[Islam]] was present during the [[Emirate of Sicily]], although Muslims were also expelled. Today, mostly due to immigration to the island, there are also several religious minorities, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, [[Hinduism]], Islam, Judaism, and [[Sikhism]]. There are also a some [[evangelicalism|Evangelical Christians]] who live on the island. As of 2020, there are approximately 4,989,921 Roman Catholics in Sicily constituting about 99.2% of the island's population. Additionally there are also about 23,120 members of the [[Italo-Albanian Catholic Church]] also living in Sicily constituting roughly 0.5% of the population.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Catholic Church in Italy [Catholic-Hierarchy] |url=https://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/country/it.html |access-date=2023-08-21 |website=www.catholic-hierarchy.org}}</ref>

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Sicily}}
The politics of Sicily takes place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy]], whereby the President of Regional Government is the [[head of government]], and of a pluriform [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the Regional Government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Sicilian Regional Assembly]]. The capital of Sicily is [[Palermo]].

Traditionally, Sicily votes for centre-right parties during elections.<ref>Peppe Cuva (12 May 2012). [https://archive.today/20130419105715/http://www.latestatanews.it/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=333:sicilia-lex-roccaforte-del-centro-destra&catid=8:politica&Itemid=11 Sicilia, l'ex roccaforte del centro-destra]. Latestatanews.it. Retrieved on 18 December 2012.</ref> From 1943 to 1951, there was also a [[separatism|separatist]] political party called [[Sicilian Independence Movement]] (''Movimento Indipendentista Siciliano'', MIS). Their most successful result was at the [[Italian general election, 1946|1946 general election]], when MIS obtained 0.7% of national votes (8.8% of votes in Sicily), and four seats. However, the movement lost all their seats following the [[Italian general election, 1948|1948 general election]] and the 1951 regional election. Even though it has never been formally disbanded, today the movement is no longer part of the [[politics of Sicily]]. After [[World War II]], Sicily became a stronghold of the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]]. Sicily is now governed by a centre-right coalition. [[Renato Schifani]] is the current President and has served since 2022.

===Administrative divisions===
[[File:Provinces of Sicily map.png|upright=1.35|thumb|Provinces of Sicily]]
Administratively, Sicily is divided into nine provinces, each with a capital city of the same name as the province. Small surrounding islands are also part of various Sicilian provinces: the [[Aeolian Islands]] (Messina), isle of [[Ustica]] (Palermo), [[Aegadian Islands]] (Trapani), isle of [[Pantelleria]] (Trapani) and [[Pelagian Islands]] (Agrigento).

Highways have been built and expanded in the last four decades. The most prominent Sicilian roads are the motorways (known as {{lang|it|autostrade}}) in the north of the island. Much of the motorway network is elevated on pillars due to the island's mountainous terrain.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.siciliaemoto.it/main.php?plc=a19palermocatania |publisher=SiciliaEMoto.it |title=A 19 autostrada Palermo – Catania |date=2 January 2008 |access-date=2 January 2008 |archive-date=23 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190123210942/http://www.siciliaemoto.it/main.php?plc=a19palermocatania |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://sicilia.indettaglio.it/ita/lineestradali/autostrade/a20/a20.html |publisher=Sicilia.Indettaglio.it |title=Autostrada A20: Messina – Palermo |date=24 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.siciliaemoto.it/main.php?plc=a29palermotrapanimazara |publisher=SiciliaEMoto.it |title=A 29 autostrada Palermo – Trapani – Mazara del Vallo |date=2 January 2008 |access-date=2 January 2008 |archive-date=23 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190123144442/http://www.siciliaemoto.it/main.php?plc=a29palermotrapanimazara |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://sicilia.indettaglio.it/ita/lineestradali/autostrade/a18/a18.html |publisher=Sicilia.Indettaglio.it |title=Autostrada: A18 Messina – Catania |date=24 October 2007}}</ref> Other main roads in Sicily are the ''Strade Statali'', such as the SS.113 that connects [[Trapani]] to Messina (via Palermo), the SS.114 Messina-[[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] (via Catania) and the SS.115 Syracuse-Trapani (via [[Ragusa, Italy|Ragusa]], [[Gela]] and [[Agrigento]]).

===Railways===
[[File:Punta Raisi staz ferr treni.jpg|thumb|Two trains inside [[Punta Raisi railway station]] within [[Palermo International Airport]]]]
[[File:Palermo Tramway System Map.jpg|thumb|[[Palermo]], AMAT tramway system map]]
[[File:GiovanniXXIII-metro.jpg|thumb|[[Catania Metro]]]]
The first railway in Sicily was opened in 1863 (Palermo-Bagheria) and today all of the Sicilian provinces are served by a network of railway services, linking to most major cities and towns; this service is operated by [[Trenitalia]]. Of the {{convert|1378|km|0|abbr=on}} of railway tracks in use, over 60% has been [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] whilst the remaining {{convert|583|km|0|abbr=on}} are serviced by [[Dieselisation|diesel]] engines. 88% of the lines (1.209&nbsp;km) are single-track and only {{convert|169|km|0|abbr=on}} are double-track serving the two main routes, Messina-Palermo ([[Tyrrhenian Sea|Tyrrhenian]]) and Messina-Catania-Syracuse ([[Ionian Sea|Ionian]]), which are the main lines of this region. Of the [[narrow-gauge railway]]s the [[Ferrovia Circumetnea]] is the only one that still operates, going round [[Mount Etna]]. From the major cities of Sicily, there are services to [[Naples]], [[Rome]] and [[Milan]]; this is achieved by the trains being loaded onto [[ferries]] which cross the Strait.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.italyheaven.co.uk/sicily/transport.html |publisher=ItalyHeaven.co.uk |title=Sicily Travel and Transport |date=2 January 2008}}</ref>

In [[Catania]] there is an [[Rapid transit|underground railway]] service ([[metropolitana di Catania]]); in [[Palermo]] the national railway operator [[Trenitalia]] operates a [[commuter rail]] ([[Palermo metropolitan railway service]]), the Sicilian Capital is also served by 4 AMAT (Comunal Public Transport Operator) tramlines; [[Messina]] is served by a [[Trams in Messina|tramline]].

===Airports===
{{Main|List of airports in Sicily}}
[[File:Aeroporto di Catania - Catania Airport.JPG|thumb|[[Catania–Fontanarossa Airport|Catania International Airport]]]]
Sicily has several airports that serve numerous Italian and European destinations and some extra-European.
* [[Catania-Fontanarossa Airport]], located on the east coast, is the busiest on the island (and one of the busiest in all of Italy).
* [[Palermo International Airport]], which is also a substantially large airport with many national and international flights.
* [[Trapani-Birgi Airport]], a military-civil joint-use airport (third for traffic on the island). Recently the airport has seen an increase in traffic thanks to the low-cost carrier [[Ryanair]].
* [[Comiso Airport|Comiso-Ragusa Airport]], has recently been refurbished and re-converted from military use to a civil airport. It was opened to commercial traffic and general aviation on 30 May 2013.
* [[Palermo-Boccadifalco Airport]] is the old airport of Palermo and is currently used for [[general aviation]] and as a base for the [[Guardia di Finanza]] and [[police helicopter]]s.
* [[Naval Air Station Sigonella|NAS Sigonella Airport]], it is an Italian Air Force and US Navy installation.
* [[Lampedusa Airport]].
* [[Pantelleria Airport]].

===Ports===
[[File:Archimarina.JPG|thumb|The port of [[Catania]]]]
By sea, Sicily is served by several ferry routes and cargo ports, and in all major cities, cruise ships dock on a regular basis.
* Mainland Italy: Ports connecting to the mainland are [[Messina]] (route to [[Villa San Giovanni]] and [[Salerno]]), the busiest passenger port in Italy, [[Palermo]] (routes to [[Genoa]], [[Civitavecchia]] and [[Naples]]) and [[Catania]] (route to [[Naples]]).
* Sicily's small surrounding islands: The port of [[Milazzo]] serves the [[Aeolian Islands]], the ports of [[Trapani]] and [[Marsala]] the [[Aegadian Islands]] and the port of [[Porto Empedocle]] the [[Pelagie Islands]]. From Palermo there is a service to the island of [[Ustica]] and to [[Sardinia]].
* International connections: From Palermo and Trapani there are weekly services to [[Tunisia]] and there is also a daily service between [[Malta]] and [[Port of Pozzallo|Pozzallo]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://it.geocities.com/traghetti2002/sicilia.html |publisher=Traghetti Guida |title=Traghetti Sicily 2008|date=2 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114044904/http://it.geocities.com/traghetti2002/sicilia.html |archive-date=14 November 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.virtuferries.com/index.aspx |publisher=VirtuFerries.com |title=High speed car/passenger ferry service |date=2 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080812054941/http://www.virtuferries.com/index.aspx |archive-date=12 August 2008}}</ref>
* Commercial and cargo ports: The port of [[Augusta, Sicily|Augusta]] is the fifth-largest cargo port in Italy and handles tonnes of goods. Other major cargo ports are Palermo, Catania, Trapani, [[Port of Pozzallo|Pozzallo]] and [[Termini Imerese]].
* Touristic ports: Several ports along the Sicilian coast are in the service of private boats that need to moor on the island. The main ports for this traffic are in [[Marina di Ragusa]], [[Riposto]], [[Portorosa]], [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], [[Cefalù]] and [[Sciacca]]. In Sicily, Palermo is also a major centre for boat rental, with or without crew, in the Mediterranean.
* Fishing ports: Like all islands, Sicily also has many fishing ports. The most important is in [[Mazara del Vallo]] followed by [[Castellamare del Golfo]], [[Licata]], [[Scoglitti]] and [[Portopalo di Capo Passero]].

===Planned bridge===
<!--Please leave the title as "Planned bridge, not "The bridge" otherwise people skimming this article will assume the bridge exists (as I did!)
-->
{{Main|Strait of Messina Bridge}}

Plans for a bridge linking Sicily to the mainland have been discussed since 1865. Throughout the last decade, plans were developed for a road and rail link to the mainland via what would be the world's longest [[suspension bridge]], the [[Strait of Messina Bridge]]. Planning for the project has experienced several false starts over the past few decades. On 6 March 2009, [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s government declared that the construction works for the Messina Bridge would begin on 23 December 2009, and announced a pledge of €1.3&nbsp;billion as a contribution to the bridge's total cost, estimated at €6.1&nbsp;billion.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7928949.stm "Italy revives Sicily bridge plan"]. [[BBC News]]. Retrieved 8 March 2009.</ref> The plan has been criticized by environmental associations and some local Sicilians and Calabrians, concerned with its environmental impact, economic sustainability and even possible infiltrations by organized crime.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/italy/story/0,,1920199,00.html |work=Guardian.co.uk |title=Italian MPs kill plan to bridge Sicily and mainland |date=2 January 2008 |location=London |first=John |last=Hooper |access-date=30 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120777463250502755?mod=todays_us_nonsub_page_one&apl=y&r=769642 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |title=No Italian Job Takes Longer Than This Bridge |date=10 April 2008 |first=Gabriel |last=Kahn}}</ref>

==Tourism==
[[File:Spiaggia Isola dei Coniglio Lampedusa.JPG|thumb|[[Lampedusa]], [[Pelagie Islands]]]]

Sicily's sunny, dry climate, scenery, cuisine, history, and architecture attract many tourists from the rest of  Italy and abroad. The tourist season peaks in the summer months, although people visit the island all year round. [[Mount Etna]], the beaches, the archaeological sites, and major cities such as [[Palermo]], [[Catania]], [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] and [[Ragusa, Sicily|Ragusa]] are the favourite tourist destinations, but the old town of [[Taormina]] and the neighbouring seaside resort of [[Giardini Naxos]] draw visitors from all over the world, as do the [[Aeolian Islands]], [[Erice]], [[Terrasini]], [[Castellammare del Golfo]], [[Cefalù]], [[Agrigento]], the [[Pelagie Islands]] and [[Capo d'Orlando]]. The last features some of the best-preserved temples of the ancient Greek period. Many Mediterranean cruise ships stop in Sicily, and many wine tourists also visit the island.

Some scenes of several Hollywood and [[Cinecittà]] films were shot in Sicily. This increased the attraction of Sicily as a tourist destination.<ref>[http://www.thegodfathertrilogy.com/gf1/gf1scene_sicily.html The Godfather. Sicilian Shooting* Locations]. thegodfathertrilogy.com</ref>

===UNESCO World Heritage Sites===

===Archaeological sites===
Because many different cultures settled, dominated or invaded the island, Sicily has a huge variety of [[archaeological sites]]. Also, some of the most notable and best preserved temples and other structures of the Greek world are located in Sicily.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jürgen |first1=Järvik |title=Greek & Roman Sites in Sicily |url=https://grandeflanerie.com/portfolio/greekromansicily/ |website=Grande Flânerie |date=13 October 2019 |publisher=WordPress |access-date=10 May 2022 |archive-date=24 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200924150435/https://grandeflanerie.com/portfolio/greekromansicily/ |url-status=dead}}</ref> Here is a short list of the major archaeological sites:
* Sicels/Sicans/Elymians/Greeks: [[Segesta]], [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]], [[Ispica|Cava Ispica]], [[Thapsos]], [[Pantalica]];
* Greeks: [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], [[Agrigento]], [[Segesta]], [[Selinunte]], [[Gela]], [[Kamarina, Sicily|Kamarina]], [[Himera]], [[Megara Hyblaea]], [[Naxos (Sicily)|Naxos]], [[Heraclea Minoa]];
* Phoenicians: [[Motya]], [[Soluntum]], [[Marsala]], [[Palermo]];
* Romans: [[Piazza Armerina]], [[Centuripe]], [[Taormina]], [[Palermo]];
The excavation and restoration of one of Sicily's best known archaeological sites, the [[Valle dei Templi|Valley of the Temples]] in Agrigento, was at the direction of the archaeologist [[Domenico Lo Faso Pietrasanta|Domenico Antonio Lo Faso Pietrasanta]], Fifth Duke of [[Serradifalco]], known in archaeological circles simply as ''"Serradifalco"''. He also oversaw the restoration of ancient sites at [[Segesta]], [[Selinunte]], [[Syracuse, Sicily|Siracusa]] and [[Taormina]].

===Coastal towers===
The Coastal towers in Sicily (''Torri costiere della Sicilia'') are 218 old [[watchtowers]] along the coast. In Sicily, the first coastal towers date back to the late Norman period. From 1360 the threat came from the south, from [[North Africa]] to [[Maghreb]], mainly to [[Barbary pirates]] and corsairs of [[Barbary Coast]]. In 1516, the Turks settled in [[Algiers]], and from 1520, the corsair [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] under the command of [[Ottoman Empire]], operated from that harbour.

Most existing towers were built on architectural designs of the Florentine architect [[Camillo Camilliani]] from [1583] to 1584 and involved the coastal periple of Sicily. The typology changed completely in '800, because of the new higher fire volumes of cannon vessels, the towers were built on the type of [[Martello towers]] that the British built in the UK and elsewhere in the British Empire. The decline of Mediterranean piracy caused by the [[Second Barbary War]] led to a smaller number of coastal towers built during the 19th century.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kirk |first1=Scott |title=Sicilian Castles and Coastal Towers |journal=Open Archaeology |date=2017 |volume=3 |issue=1 |publisher=De Gruyter |location=Albuquerque |pages=318, 319–329 |doi=10.1515/opar-2017-0021 |s2cid=67397794 |url=https://www.academia.edu/35190827 |access-date=7 October 2019|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Sicily has long been associated with [[the arts]]; many poets, writers, [[philosophy|philosophers]], intellectuals, architects and painters have roots on the island.

==== Ceramics ====
[[Terracotta]] [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]] from the island are well known, the art of ceramics on Sicily goes back to the original ancient peoples named the [[Sicani]]ans, it was then perfected during the period of Greek colonisation and is still prominent and distinct to this day.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bestofsicily.com/ceramic.htm |publisher=BestOfSicily.com |title=Sicilian Ceramic Art |date=2 January 2008}}</ref> Nowadays, [[Caltagirone]] is one of the most important centres in Sicily for the artistic production of ceramics and terra-cotta sculptures. Famous painters include [[Renaissance]] artist [[Antonello da Messina]], [[Pietro Novelli]], [[Bruno Caruso]], [[Renato Guttuso]] and Greek born [[Giorgio de Chirico]] who is commonly dubbed the "father of [[Surrealist art]]" and founder of the [[metaphysical art]] movement.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thrall Soby |first=James |title=The Early Chirico |publisher=Ayer Co Pub |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GtnYEBkmkIcC&q=%22father+of+surrealist+art%22&pg=PA93 |isbn=978-0-405-00736-1 |year=1969}}</ref> The most noted architects are [[Filippo Juvarra]] (one of the most important figures of the Italian [[Baroque]]) and [[Ernesto Basile]].

====Sicilian Baroque====
{{Main|Sicilian Baroque}}

The [[Sicilian Baroque]] has a unique architectural identity. [[Noto]], [[Caltagirone]], [[Catania]], [[Ragusa, Italy|Ragusa]], [[Modica]], [[Scicli]] and particularly [[Acireale]] contain some of Italy's best examples of [[Baroque architecture]], carved in the local red [[sandstone]]. Noto provides one of the best examples of the Baroque architecture brought to Sicily. The Baroque style in Sicily was largely confined to buildings erected by the church, and [[palazzo|palazzi]] built as private residences for the Sicilian aristocracy.<ref>"Palazzo" (pl. ''palazzi''): is any large building in a town, state or private (often much smaller than the term ''palace'' implies in the [[English-speaking world]]). While ''palazzo'' is the technically correct appellation and postal address, no Sicilian aristocrat would ever use the word, instead referring to his or her own house, however large, as "casa". "Palazzo" followed by the family name was the term used by officials, tradesmen, and delivery men. Gefen, p. 15.</ref> The earliest examples of this style in Sicily lacked individuality and were typically heavy-handed pastiches of buildings seen by Sicilian visitors to Rome, [[Florence]], and [[Naples]]. However, even at this early stage, provincial architects had begun to incorporate certain vernacular features of Sicily's older architecture. By the middle of the 18th century, when Sicily's Baroque architecture was noticeably different from that of the mainland, it has a unique freedom of design that is difficult to characterize in words.

The golden age of Sicilian poetry began in the early 13th century with the [[Sicilian School]] of [[Giacomo da Lentini]], which was highly influential on [[Italian literature]]. Some of the most noted figures among writers and poets are [[Luigi Pirandello]] ([[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureate, 1934]]), [[Salvatore Quasimodo]] ([[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureate, 1959]]), [[Giovanni Verga]] (the father of the ''Italian [[Verismo (literature)|Verismo]]''), [[Domenico Tempio]], [[Giovanni Meli]], [[Luigi Capuana]], [[Mario Rapisardi]], [[Federico de Roberto]], [[Leonardo Sciascia]], [[Vitaliano Brancati]], [[Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa]], [[Elio Vittorini]], [[Vincenzo Consolo]] and [[Andrea Camilleri]] (noted for his novels and short stories with the fictional character [[Salvo Montalbano|Inspector Salvo Montalbano]] as protagonist). On the political side notable philosophers include [[Gaetano Mosca]] and [[Giovanni Gentile]] who wrote ''[[The Doctrine of Fascism]]''.

Sicilian was an early influence in the development of the first Italian standard, although its use remained confined to an intellectual elite. This was a literary language in Sicily created under the auspices of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] and his court of notaries, or ''Magna Curia'', which, headed by [[Giacomo da Lentini]], also gave birth to the [[Sicilian School]], widely inspired by [[troubadour]] literature. Its linguistic and poetic heritage was later assimilated into the literary Florentine dialect use by [[Dante Alighieri]], the father of modern Italian. Dante, in his {{lang|it|[[De vulgari eloquentia]]}}, claims that "In effect, this vernacular seems to deserve higher praise than the others since all the poetry written by Italians can be called Sicilian".<ref>{{cite book |last=Alighieri |first=Dante |author-link=Dante Alighieri |title=De vulgari eloquentia |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-40064-0|date=10 October 1996}}</ref> It is in this language that appeared the first [[sonnet]], whose invention is attributed to Giacomo da Lentini himself.

Other languages are spoken in Sicily. Within the [[province of Palermo]], four towns are home to speakers of [[Arbëresh language|Arbërësh]] varieties.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nasse |first=George Nicholas |title=The Italo-Albanian Villages of Southern Italy |publisher=National Academy of Sciences - National Research Council |year=1964 |location=Washington, D.

===Education===
Sicily has four universities:
* The [[University of Catania]] dates back to 1434 and it is the oldest university in Sicily. It currently hosts 12 faculties and over 62,000 students and it offers undergraduate and postgraduate programs. [[Catania]] hosts also the ''[[Scuola superiore di Catania|Scuola Superiore]]'', an [[academic institution]] linked to the University of Catania, aiming for excellence in education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scuolasuperiorecatania.it/include/cambialingua.php?idpagina=1&lingua=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908090945/http://www.scuolasuperiorecatania.it/include/cambialingua.php?idpagina=1&lingua=2|url-status=dead|title=''Scuola Superiore di Catania'' – Official site|archive-date=8 September 2010}}</ref>
* The [[University of Palermo]] is the island's second-oldest university. It was officially founded in 1806, although historical records indicate that medicine and law have been taught there since the late 15th century. The [[Orto botanico di Palermo]] (Palermo botanical gardens) is home to the university's Department of Botany and is also open to visitors.
* The [[University of Messina]], founded in 1548 by [[Ignatius of Loyola]]. It is organized in 11 Faculties.
* The [[Kore University of Enna]] founded in 1995, is the latest Sicilian university and the first university founded in Sicily after the [[Italian Unification]].

It was the [[Normans]] and [[Hohenstaufen|Swabians]] who first introduced a fondness for meat dishes to the island.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bestofsicily.com/food.htm |publisher=BestofSicily.com |title=Sicilian Food and Wine |date=24 June 2007}}</ref> Some varieties of wine are produced from vines that are relatively unique to the island, such as the [[Nero d'Avola]] made near the baroque town of [[Noto]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Maria |first=Anna |title=Sicilian Fig Cookies |url=http://www.annamariavolpi.com/page47.html |publisher=Anna Maria's Open Kitchen |access-date=29 March 2011}}</ref>

The most popular sport in Sicily is [[association football|football]], which came to the fore in the late 19th century under the influence of the English. Some of the oldest football clubs in Italy are from Sicily: the three most successful are [[U.S. Città di Palermo|Palermo]], [[Calcio Catania|Catania]], and [[A.C.R. Messina|Messina]], which have played 29, 17 and 5 seasons in the [[Serie A]] respectively. No club from Sicily has ever won Serie A, but football is still deeply embedded in local culture and all over Sicily most towns have a representative team.<ref name="derbysicil" />

Palermo and Catania have a heated rivalry and compete in the [[Derby di Sicilia|Sicilian derby]] together. Palermo is the only team in Sicily to have played on the European stage, in the [[UEFA Cup]]. In the island, the most noted footballer is [[Salvatore Schillaci]], who won the [[FIFA World Cup awards|Golden Boot]] at the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] with [[Italy national football team|Italy]].<ref name="derbysicil" /> Other noted players include [[Giuseppe Furino]], [[Pietro Anastasi]], [[Francesco Coco]], [[Christian Riganò]], and [[Roberto Galia]].<ref name="derbysicil">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2004/11/11/sfneur11.xml |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |title=Sicilian derby takes centre stage |date=7 October 2007 |location=London |first=Richard |last=Bright |access-date=30 March 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> There have also been some noted managers from the island, such as [[Carmelo Di Bella]] and [[Franco Scoglio]].

Although football is the most popular sport in Sicily, the island also has participants in other fields. [[Amatori Catania]] have competed in the top Italian national [[rugby union]] league called [[Top12|National Championship of Excellence]]. They have even participated at the European level in the [[European Challenge Cup]]. Competing in the basketball variation of [[Serie A (basketball)|Serie A]] is [[Orlandina Basket]] from [[Capo d'Orlando]] in the [[province of Messina]], where the sport has a reasonable following. Various other sports that are played to some extent include volleyball, [[Team handball|handball]], and [[water polo]]. Previously, in [[motorsport]], Sicily held the prominent [[Targa Florio]] sports car race that took place in the Madonie Mountains, with the start-finish line in [[Cerda]].<ref name="targa" /> The event was started in 1906 by Sicilian industrialist and automobile enthusiast [[Vincenzo Florio]], and ran until it was canceled due to safety concerns in 1977.<ref name="targa">{{cite news |url=http://www.porsche.com/all/targaflorio/international.aspx |publisher=Porsche.com |title=Targa Florio 1906–1977 |date=7 October 2007 |access-date=18 March 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230060505/https://www.porsche.com/all/targaflorio/international.aspx |archive-date=30 December 2010}}</ref>

From 28 September to 9 October 2005 [[Trapani]] was the location of Acts 8 and 9 of the [[Louis Vuitton Cup]]. This sailing race featured, among other entrants, all boats that took part in the 2007 [[America's Cup]].

===Popular culture===
Each town and city has its own patron saint, and the [[feast day]]s are marked by colourful processions through the streets with marching bands and displays of fireworks.

Sicilian religious festivals also include the ''presepe vivente'' (living [[nativity scene]]), which takes place at Christmas time. Deftly combining religion and folklore, it is a constructed mock 19th-century Sicilian village, complete with a nativity scene, and has people of all ages dressed in the costumes of the period, some impersonating the Holy Family, and others working as artisans of their particular assigned trade. It is normally concluded on [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], often highlighted by the arrival of the [[magi]] on horseback.

Oral tradition plays a large role in Sicilian folklore. Many stories passed down from generation to generation involve a character named "[[Giufà]]". Anecdotes from this character's life preserve Sicilian culture as well as convey moral messages.

Sicilians also enjoy outdoor festivals, held in the local square or ''piazza'' where live music and dancing are performed on stage, and food fairs or ''sagre'' are set up in booths lining the square. These offer various local specialties, as well as typical Sicilian food. Normally these events are concluded with fireworks. A noted ''sagra'' is the ''Sagra del Carciofo'' or ''[[Artichoke]] Festival'', which is held annually in [[Ramacca]] in April. The most important traditional event in Sicily is the [[carnival]]. Famous carnivals are in [[Acireale]], [[Misterbianco]], [[Regalbuto]], [[Paternò]], [[Sciacca]], [[Termini Imerese]].

The '''[[Opera dei Pupi]]''' (Opera of the Puppets; [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]: Òpira dî pupi) is a [[marionette]] theatrical representation of Frankish romantic poems such as the [[Song of Roland]] or ''[[Orlando furioso]]'' that is one of the characteristic cultural traditions of Sicily. The sides of donkey carts are decorated with intricate, painted scenes; these same tales are enacted in traditional [[puppet theatre]]s featuring hand-made marionettes of wood. The opera of the puppets and the Sicilian tradition of ''cantastorî'' (singers of tales) are rooted in the Provençal [[troubadour]] tradition in Sicily during the reign of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], in the first half of the 13th century. A great place to see this marionette art is the puppet theatres of [[Palermo]]. The Sicilian marionette theatre Opera dei Pupi was proclaimed in 2001 and inscribed in 2008 in the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].<ref>{{cite web |author=UNESCO Culture Sector |title=El teatro de marionetas siciliano Opera dei Puppi |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00011&RL=00011 |access-date=22 August 2010}}</ref>

Today, there are only a few troupes that maintain the tradition. They often perform for tourists. However, there are no longer the great historical families of marionettists, such as the Greco of [[Palermo]]; the [[Gaspare Canino|Canino]] of [[Partinico]] and [[Alcamo]]; Crimi, Trombetta and Napoli of [[Catania]], Pennisi and Macri of [[Acireale]], Profeta of [[Licata]], Gargano and Grasso of [[Agrigento]]. One can, however, admire the richest collection of marionettes at the Museo Internazionale delle Marionette Antonio Pasqualino and at the [[Museo Etnografico Siciliano Giuseppe Pitrè]] in Palermo. Other elaborate marionettes are on display at the Museo Civico Vagliasindi in [[Randazzo]].

===Traditional items===
[[File:Sicilian Cart Agrigento.jpg|thumb|A traditional [[Sicilian cart]]]]

The [[Sicilian cart]] is an ornate, colourful style of a horse- or donkey-drawn cart native to Sicily. Sicilian woodcarver [[George Petralia]] states that horses were mostly used in the city and flat plains, while donkeys or mules were more often used in rough terrain for hauling heavy loads.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sicilianwoodcarver.com/ |title=George Petralia |publisher=Sicilian Wood Carver |access-date=9 April 2011 |archive-date=18 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918002048/http://sicilianwoodcarver.com/ |url-status=dead}}</ref> The cart has two wheels and is primarily handmade out of wood with iron components.

The Sicilian [[coppola (cap)|coppola]] is a traditional kind of [[flat cap]] typically worn by men in Sicily. First used by English nobles during the late 18th century, the ''tascu'' began being used in Sicily in the early 20th century as a [[flat cap|driving cap]], usually worn by car drivers. The ''coppola'' is usually made in [[tweed (cloth)|tweed]]. Today it is widely regarded as a definitive symbol of Sicilian heritage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontoeurope.com/cities/2005/Catania/06-05index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605150227/http://www.ontoeurope.com/cities/2005/Catania/06-05index.html|url-status=dead|title=Virgin Express Inflight Magazine – Catania|archive-date=5 June 2008}}</ref>

=== <span class="anchor" id="Flag"></span> <span class="anchor" id="Regional symbols"></span> Flag and emblem===
{{Main|Triskelion#Sicily|Flag of Sicily}}

The [[Flag of Sicily]], regarded as a regional icon, was first adopted in 1282, after the [[Sicilian Vespers]] of [[Palermo]].<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://sicilianfoodculture.com/history-sicilian-flag/ | title=Our History: the Sicilian Flag | date=March 1, 2018}}</ref> It is characterised by the presence of the [[triskelion|triskeles]] in the middle, depicting the head of [[Medusa]] and three wheat ears representing the extreme fertility of the land of Sicily. In early mythology, when Medusa was slain and beheaded by Perseus, the Medusa head was placed in the centre of Athena's shield.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.italymagazine.com/dual-language/what-does-symbol-sicily-mean | title=What Does the Symbol of Sicily Mean? | work=Italy Magazine}}</ref>

Palermo and Corleone were the first two cities to found a confederation against the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] rule. The triskeles symbol came to be on the Sicilian flag in 1943 during [[World War II]] when [[Andrea Finocchiaro Aprile]] led an independence movement, in collaboration with the allies. Their plan was to help Sicily become independent and form a free republic. The colours, likewise introduced in the 1940s, respectively represent the cities of [[Palermo]] and [[Corleone]]. The separatist behind the movement used a yellow and red flag with the Trinacria in the centre of it. When [[World War II]] ended, Sicily was recognized as an autonomous region in the Italian Republic.

The flag became the official public flag of the ''Regione Siciliana'' in January 2000, after the passing of an apposite regional law which advocates its use on public buildings, schools and city halls along with the national [[Flag of Italy|Italian flag]] and the [[flag of EU|European]] one.

Familiar as an ancient symbol of the region, the [[Triskelion]] is also featured on Greek coins of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], such as coins of [[Agathocles]] (317–289 BC).The symbol dates back to when Sicily was part of [[Magna Graecia]], the colonial extension of [[Greece]] beyond the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].<ref>Matthews, Jeff (2005) [http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/symbols.htm Symbols of Naples] {{webarchive | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030202145/http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/symbols.htm | date = 30 October 2009}}</ref> The triskelion was revived, as a [[neoclassicism|neoclassic]] – and non-[[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] – emblem for the new Napoleonic Kingdom of the [[Two Sicilies]], by [[Joachim Murat]] in 1808. In the case of Sicily, the triskelion symbol is said to represent the three [[Cape (geography)|capes]] ([[headland]]s or [[promontory|promontories]] of the island of Sicily, namely: [[Punta del Faro|Pelorus]] (Peloro, Tip of Faro, Messina: North-East); [[Capo Passero|Pachynus]] (Passero, Syracuse: South); and [[Marsala|Lilybæum]] (Lilibeo, Cape Boeo, Marsala: West), which form three points of a triangle.<ref>Radicini, Ninni.
