'''Kasama''' is a town in the [[Northern Province, Zambia|Northern Province]] of [[Zambia]]. It serves as the provincial capital and the headquarters of [[Kasama District]].<ref name="1R">{{cite web|url=https://www.zambia-advisor.com/kasama-town.html |title=About Kasama Town, Northern Province, Zambia |date=4 October 2018 |access-date=4 October 2018 |author=Zambia Advisor |work=Zambia-Advisor.com}}</ref>

==Location==
It is situated on the central-southern African plateau, approximately {{convert|856|km|0}}, by road, north-east of [[Lusaka]], the capital and largest city in Zambia.<ref name="2R">{{cite web|access-date=4 October 2018 |date=4 October 2018 |publisher=Globefeed.com |author=Globefeed.com |   url=https://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Zambia_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Lusaka%2C%20Zambia&toplace=Kasama%2C%20Zambia&dt1=ChIJSaq8PH3zQBkR6xMgRsGT0NA&dt2=ChIJA9tXgRzGCBkRviTKP1u-0n8&sr=dc | title=Distance between Lusaka, Zambia and Kasama, Zambia}}</ref>

Kasama is located on the [[M1 road (Zambia)|M1 road]] (old [[Great North Road (Zambia)|Great North Road]]) from [[Mpika]] in the south to [[Mbala, Zambia|Mbala]] and [[Mpulungu]], at the tip of [[Lake Tanganyika]], in the north.

==Population==
The city population grew considerably in the 1970s and 1980s after construction of the [[TAZARA Railway]] through the city, and the tarring of the [[Great North Road, Zambia]]. Its population, according to [[Encyclopedia Britannica]], was 74,243 in 2000 and had increased to 113,779 in 2010.<ref name="5R">{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Kasama |date=4 October 2018 |title=Population of Kasama Town, Zambia |publisher=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]] |author=((The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica)) | access-date=4 October 2018 |location=Chicago, Illinois, United States}}</ref>

== History ==

The 1898/1899 interregnum on the Mwamba throne, the then second in rank from the Chitimukulu, made it possible for Catholic [[Joseph Dupont (bishop)|Bishop Joseph 'Moto Moto' Dupont]] to facilitate the establishment of the [[British Empire|British]] [[Colonialism|colonial]] administration of [[North-Eastern Rhodesia]] under Administrator [[Robert Edward Codrington|Robert Codrington]]. The first BSAC administrative [[Boma (enclosure)|boma]] was established at '''Kasama.''' Due to the town's central location as well as its closeness to Chitimukulu's and Mwamb's courts, it eventually became the largest and dominant town of the north-eastern lobe of [[Northern Rhodesia]], then later, Zambia.

== Economic activities ==
The town has a few modern facilities, among them are a [[Shoprite (South Africa)|Shoprite Checkers]] branch, Budget Stores, a local supermarket called PJT and four bakeries. The town has branches of Zambian [[commercial bank]]s including [[Zambia National Commercial Bank]], National Savings & Credit Bank, [[Atlas Mara Bank Zambia Limited]], [[Standard Chartered Zambia]], [[Cavmont Bank]], [[Barclays Bank of Zambia]], [[Access Bank Zambia]] and [[Indo-Zambia Bank Limited]]. The town has VISA and ATM services.<ref name="1R"/>

Most people in Kasama are not formally employed, and they run small businesses to earn a living. The hospital is the [[Kasama General Hospital]], that provides locals with health services. The city has a police station and several police posts. The available mobile telephone operators include [[MTN Group]], [[Bharti Airtel|Airtel Zambia]] and [[Zamtel]].<ref name="1R"/>

There are several Agri Based industries in Kasama, which include Northern Coffee Company Limited (NCCL), a subsidiary of Olam International, growing coffee at Kateshi Estates,<ref>{{cite web |title=Zambia |url=https://www.olamgroup.com/locations/southern-africa/zambia.html |website=Olam |publisher=Olam International |access-date=12 February 2020}}</ref> and Kalungwishi Estates growing sugar cane and producing the Kasama Sugar brand.

== Ethnic groups ==
Kasama is in the heartland of the [[Bemba people|Bemba]] ethnic group,<ref name="1R"/> whose [[Paramount Chief]] [[Chitimukulu]] maintains his headquarters {{convert|9|km|0}} from Malole, which is {{convert|51|km|0}} east of the city center.<ref name="6R">{{cite web|access-date=4 October 2018 | url=https://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Zambia_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Kasama%2C%20Zambia&toplace=Malole%2C%20Zambia&dt1=ChIJA9tXgRzGCBkRviTKP1u-0n8&dt2=ChIJm5UZX-emCBkRD9aqYtbYp5s&sr=dc | date=4 October 2018 |title=Distance between Kasama, Zambia and Malole, Zambia |publisher=Globefeed.com |author=Globefeed.com}}</ref>

== World War I ==
[[File:Chambeshi Monument 03.jpg|thumb|right|Chambeshi Monument commemorating notification of [[Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck|von Lettow-Vorbeck]] of the signing of the armistice at the end of WWI, 3 days after the end of the war in Europe.]]
At the end of [[East African Campaign (World War I)|World War I]], when it consisted of a handful of government offices and a dozen stores, it was evacuated by its British population of a couple of dozen in the face of a surprise raid from the north-east by [[German East Africa]]n forces under General [[Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck]]. Not knowing that the [[armistice]] had occurred in [[Europe]] the day before, the Germans took the abandoned town on 12 November 1918 and continued south-west (there was no [[battle]] at Kasama since the British imperial forces were at [[Mbala, Zambia|Abercorn]]), agreeing a [[cease-fire]] at the [[Chambeshi River]] on 14 November when they were informed of the German [[Surrender (military)|surrender]] in Europe. For further details, see [[Von Lettow-Vorbeck Memorial]].
