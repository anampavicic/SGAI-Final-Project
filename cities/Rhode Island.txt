==Name==
===Origin of the name===
Despite its name, most of Rhode Island is on the U.S. mainland. Its official name was ''State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations'' from its beginning in 1636 until 2020, and it is referred to in that manner in the [[United States Constitution]].<ref>U.S. Const. Art. I, s. 2, cl. 3.</ref> This name was derived from the merger of Colonial settlements around Narragansett Bay, and outside the jurisdiction of Plymouth colony. The settlements of Rhode Island ([[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] and [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]]) were on Rhode Island, also known as [[Aquidneck Island]].{{efn|This island is the largest of several islands in [[Narragansett Bay]].}}<ref name="portsmouth">{{cite web |title=A Brief History of the Colony of Rhode Island, 1630-1690 |url=http://www.celebrateboston.com/history/rhode-island.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717165716/http://www.celebrateboston.com/history/rhode-island.htm |archive-date=July 17, 2015 |access-date=July 16, 2015 |publisher=Celebrate Boston}}</ref> ''Providence Plantations'' referred to settlements on the mainland of Providence and [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Warwick]].<ref name="water">{{cite web |title=Rhode Island Geography Maps |url=http://www.dlt.ri.gov/lmi/map.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117053440/http://www.dlt.ri.gov/lmi/map.htm |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |access-date=January 26, 2013 |publisher=RI Department of Labor & Training}}</ref>

It is unclear how the island came to be named ''Rhode Island'', but two historical events may have been influential:

* Explorer [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] noted the presence of an island near the mouth of [[Narragansett Bay]] in 1524 which he likened to the island of [[Rhodes]] off the coast of Greece.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Verrazano|first1=Giovanni|title=Verrazano's voyage along the Atlantic coast of North America, 1524|publisher=State University of New York at Albany|page=10 |url=https://archive.org/stream/verrazanosvoyage00verr#page/10/mode/2up/search/Rhodes|access-date=August 14, 2015}}</ref> Subsequent European explorers were unable to precisely identify the island Verrazzano described, but the colonists who settled the area assumed that it was this island.{{efn|Giovanni da Verrazzano named a place on Rhode Island ''Puntum Iovianum'' in honor of his friend Paolo Giovio (Jovium in Latin) (1483–1542), humanist and historian. Giovio owned the [[Cèllere Codex]] of Verrazzano containing the text of his first trip.}}
* [[Adriaen Block]] passed by the island during his expeditions in the 1610s, and described it in a 1625 account of his travels as "an island of reddish appearance", which was "{{Lang|nl|een rodlich Eylande}}" in 17th-century Dutch, meaning a red or reddish island, supposedly evolving into the designation Rhode Island.<ref name="books.google.com">{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUJg2uqb7LgC&pg=PA70 |title=1636–1700 |author=Samuel Greene Arnold |date=1859 |page=70 |publisher=Appleton |via=Google Books |access-date=October 17, 2015 |archive-date=January 1, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101112942/https://books.google.com/books?id=iUJg2uqb7LgC&pg=PA70 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.s4ulanguages.com/delaet.html |title=Joannes de Laet |website=S4U Languages |language=pt |access-date=December 11, 2015 |archive-date=October 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191022191206/http://www.s4ulanguages.com/delaet.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Historians have theorized that this "reddish appearance" resulted from either red autumn foliage or red clay on portions of the shore.<ref>{{cite book |author=Elisha Potter |year=1835 |title=The Early History of Narragansett.

The earliest documented use of the name "Rhode Island" for Aquidneck was in 1637 by Roger Williams. The name was officially applied to the island in 1644 with these words: "Aquethneck shall be henceforth called the Isle of Rodes or Rhode-Island." The name "Isle of Rodes" is used in a legal document as late as 1646.<ref>[http://sos.ri.gov/library/history/name/ Office of the Secretary of State: A.

===Changes to the name===
The first English settlement in Rhode Island was the town of Providence, which the [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] granted to Roger Williams in 1636.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}} At that time, Williams obtained no permission from the English crown, as he believed the English had no legitimate claim on Narragansett and [[Wampanoag]] territory.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Warren |first1=James |title=God, War, and Providence: the Epic Struggle of Roger Williams and the Narragansett Indians against the Puritans of New England |date=June 12, 2018 |publisher=Scribner |isbn=978-1501180415|page=138}}</ref>{{verify source|date=February 2023}} Williams traveled to London in 1643, during the English Civil War, to obtain legal recognition of the new settlements. A [[Letters patent|Patent]] was granted to "the incorporation of Providence Plantations in Narragansett Bay in New England" by the Parliamentary committee on [[Plantation (settlement or colony)|Foreign Plantations]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Magazine |first1=Smithsonian |title=God, Government and Roger Williams' Big Idea |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/god-government-and-roger-williams-big-idea-6291280/ |website=Smithsonian Magazine |language=en}}</ref> After the English Civil war, a Royal Charter was granted in 1663, giving the colony an official name of the "Governor and Company of the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, in New England, in America."<ref>{{cite web |title=Rhode Island Charter |url=https://www.sos.ri.gov/divisions/civics-and-education/for-educators/themed-collections/rhode-island-charter |website=www.sos.ri.gov |publisher=Rhode Island Secretary of State |access-date=8 February 2023}}</ref> Following the [[American Revolution]], in 1790 the new state incorporated as the "State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations". However, as matter of convenience, the state came to be commonly known as simply "Rhode Island".

The word ''plantation'' in the state's name became a contested issue during the 20th century and the increased awareness of slavery and its role in early Rhode Island history. The General Assembly voted in 2009 to hold a referendum in November 2010 on removing "and Providence Plantations" from the official name. Advocates for excising ''plantation'' argued that the word symbolized a legacy of disenfranchisement for many Rhode Islanders, as well as the proliferation of slavery in the colonies and in the post-colonial United States.

At the onset of European colonization what is now Rhode Island was inhabited mainly by five Native American tribes - by far most of the state's territory was inhabited by the [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]], eastern borderlands were occupied by the [[Wampanoag]], south-western coast by the [[Niantic people|Niantic]], western borderlands by the [[Pequots|Pequot]] and northern borderlands by the [[Nipmuc]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rhode Island Indian Tribes and Languages |url=https://www.native-languages.org/rhode.htm |access-date=2024-09-04 |website=www.native-languages.org}}</ref>{{Self-published inline|date=September 2024}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=Swanton |first=John Reed |title=The Indian Tribes of North America |pages=27–29}}</ref> In 1636, [[Roger Williams]] was banished from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] for his religious views, and he settled at the top of Narragansett Bay on land sold or given to him by Narragansett sachem [[Canonicus]]. He named the site Providence, "having a sense of God's merciful providence unto me in my distress",<ref name="Conley">An Album of Rhode Island History by Patrick T.

In 1638 (after conferring with Williams), [[Anne Hutchinson]], [[William Coddington]], [[John Clarke (Baptist minister)|John Clarke]], [[Philip Sherman (settler)|Philip Sherman]], and other religious dissenters were allowed to settle on [[Aquidneck Island]] (also known as Rhode Island), by the Narragansett Sachems [[Canonicus]] and [[Miantonomi]]. They were given a few items in reciprocity for their generosity. However, as Roger Williams made clear in a letter to John Winthrop in June 1638: "Sir, concerning the islands Prudence and…Aquedenick…neither of them were sold properly, for a thousand fathom would not have bought either, by strangers. The truth is, not a penny was demanded for either, and what was paid was only gratuity, though I chose, for better assurance and form, to call it sale."<ref>{{cite web |title=Roger Williams to John Winthrop |url=https://www.masshist.org/publications/winthrop/index.php/view/PWF04d035#sn=6 |website=Winthrop Family Papers |publisher=[[Massachusetts Historical Society]] |access-date=6 September 2023}}</ref> This settlement was first called Pocasset and then changed in 1639 to [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]].

[[Samuel Gorton]] purchased lands at [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Shawomet]] in 1642 from the Narragansetts, precipitating a dispute with the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In 1644, Providence, Portsmouth, and Newport united for their common independence as the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], governed by an elected council and "president".

During the [[American Civil War]], Rhode Island was the first Union state to send troops in response to [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]]'s request for help from the states. Rhode Island furnished 25,236 fighting men, of whom 1,685 died.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} On the home front, Rhode Island and the other northern states used their industrial capacity to supply the Union Army with the materials it needed to win the war. The [[United States Naval Academy]] moved to Rhode Island temporarily during the war.

In 1866, Rhode Island abolished racial segregation in the public schools throughout the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/studteaguide/RhodeIslandHistory/chapt5.html |title=Rhode Island History: CHAPTER V: Change, Controversy, and War, 1846–1865 |access-date=March 28, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203064148/http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/studteaguide/RhodeIslandHistory/chapt5.html |archive-date=February 3, 2006 }}</ref>

===Gilded Age===
[[File:The_Breakers_interior_05.jpg|thumb|Interior of [[The Breakers]], a Newport symbol of the Gilded Age]]
The 50 years following the Civil War were a time of prosperity and affluence that author William G. McLoughlin calls "Rhode Island's halcyon era". Rhode Island was a center of the [[Gilded Age]] and provided a home or summer home to many of the country's most prominent industrialists. This was a time of growth in textile mills and manufacturing and brought an influx of immigrants to fill those jobs, bringing population growth and urbanization. In [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], New York's wealthiest industrialists created a summer haven to socialize and build [[Preservation Society of Newport County|grand mansions]]. Thousands of French-Canadian, Italian, Irish, and Portuguese immigrants arrived to fill jobs in the textile and manufacturing mills in Providence, Pawtucket, Central Falls, and Woonsocket.<ref name="McLoughlin" />

===World War I===
During World War I, Rhode Island furnished 28,817 soldiers, of whom 612 died. After the war, the state was hit hard by the [[Spanish Influenza]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/studteaguide/RhodeIslandHistory/chapt7.html |title=Rhode Island History: Chapter VII: Boom, Bust, and War, 1900–1945 |access-date=March 28, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060302040555/http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/studteaguide/rhodeislandhistory/chapt7.html |archive-date=March 2, 2006 }}</ref>

In the 1920s and 1930s, rural Rhode Island saw a surge in [[Ku Klux Klan]] membership, largely in reaction to large waves of [[immigrants]] moving to the state.

===Growth in the modern era: 1929–present===
Since the [[Great Depression]], the [[Rhode Island Democratic Party]] has dominated local politics. Rhode Island has comprehensive health insurance for low-income children and a large [[social safety net]]. However, many urban areas still have a high rate of child poverty. Due to an influx of residents from [[Boston]], increasing housing costs have resulted in more homelessness in Rhode Island.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://204.17.79.244/profiles/cw_pro.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060425093125/http://204.17.79.244/profiles/cw_pro.html | archive-date = April 25, 2006 | title = Providence Neighborhood Profiles }}</ref>

In March, 2010, heavy rain and rising rivers caused record floods. The first period of rainy weather in mid-March caused localized flooding and, two weeks later, more rain caused more widespread flooding in many towns, especially south of Providence. Rain totals on March 29–30, 2010 exceeded 14&nbsp;inches (35.5&nbsp;cm) in many locales, resulting in the inundation of area rivers—especially the Pawtuxet River which runs through central Rhode Island. The overflow of the Pawtuxet River, nearly {{convert|11|ft|m|0}} above flood stage, submerged a sewage treatment plant and closed a five-mile (8&nbsp;km) stretch of [[Interstate 95]]. In addition, it flooded two shopping malls, numerous businesses, and many homes in the towns of Warwick, West Warwick, Cranston, and Westerly. Amtrak service was also suspended between New York and Boston during this period. Following the flood, Rhode Island was in a state of emergency for two days. The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) was called in to help flood victims.-->

Rhode Island is vulnerable to tropical storms and hurricanes due to its location in New England, catching the brunt of many storms that blow up the eastern seaboard. Hurricanes that have done significant damage in the state include the [[1938 New England hurricane]], [[Hurricane Carol]] (1954), [[Hurricane Donna]] (1960), and [[Hurricane Bob]] (1991).

===Cities and towns===
{{Main|List of municipalities in Rhode Island}}
{{See also|Rhode Island locations by per capita income|Category:Villages in Rhode Island}}Rhode Island is divided into [[list of counties in Rhode Island|five counties]] but it has no county governments. The entire state is divided into 39 municipalities, which handle all local government affairs.

There are 8 cities and 31 towns in Rhode Island. Major population centers today result from historical factors; development took place predominantly along the [[Blackstone River|Blackstone]], [[Seekonk River|Seekonk]], and [[Providence River]]s with the advent of the water-powered mill. Providence is the base of a large metropolitan area.

[[File:Touro_Synagogue,_Newport,_Rhode_Island.jpg|thumb|[[Touro Synagogue]] in Newport is the [[Oldest synagogues in the United States|oldest existing synagogue building]] in the United States.]]
Rhode Island's Jewish community, centered in the Providence area, emerged during a wave of Jewish immigration predominantly from Eastern Europeans [[shtetl]]s between 1880 and 1920. The presence of the [[Touro Synagogue]] in Newport, the oldest existing synagogue in the United States, emphasizes that these second-wave immigrants did not create Rhode Island's first Jewish community; a comparatively smaller wave of [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] immigrated to Newport during the colonial era. In 2022, they made up 2% of the state's population.<ref name=":2" />

The religiously unaffiliated since 2014 were 20% of the population, though the separate study by the Public Religion Research Institute determined the irreligious increased to 29% of the adult population.<ref name=":1" /> In 2022, the religiously unaffiliated declined to 24% of the population.<ref name=":2" />

=== Native American tribes ===
Today  Many inhabitants of Rhode Island identify as being Native American alone (6,058 people in 2010 census and 7,385 in 2020) or Native American in combination with one or more other races (8,336 people in 2010 census and 15,972 in 2020).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Race and Ethnicity in the United States: 2010 Census and 2020 Census |url=https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/race-and-ethnicity-in-the-united-state-2010-and-2020-census.html}}</ref> Many inhabitants of Rhode Island also reported belonging to tribes in 2010 census, the largest of which were the Narragansett (2,820 people), the Cherokee (987), the Wampanoag (559) and the Pequot (424).

The Blackstone River Valley was a major contributor to the [[Economic history of the United States|American]] Industrial Revolution. It was in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island|Pawtucket]] that [[Samuel Slater]] set up [[Slater Mill]] in 1793,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slatermill.org|publisher=Slater Mill Historic Site|title=Slater Mill|access-date=April 13, 2008|archive-date=May 9, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509194026/http://www.slatermill.org/|url-status=live}}</ref> using the waterpower of the [[Blackstone River]] to power his [[cotton mill]]. For a while, Rhode Island was one of the leaders in textiles. However, with the [[Great Depression]], most textile factories relocated to southern U.S. states. The textile industry still constitutes a part of the Rhode Island economy but does not have the same power.

Other important industries in Rhode Island's past included toolmaking, [[costume jewelry]], and [[cutlery|silverware]]. An interesting by-product of Rhode Island's industrial history is the number of abandoned factories, many of which are now condominiums, museums, offices, and low-income and elderly housing. Today, much of Rhode Island's economy is based on services, particularly healthcare and education, and still manufacturing to some extent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.bls.gov/eag/eag.ri.htm|title=Rhode Island Economy at a Glance|publisher=US Dept. of Labor|access-date=April 13, 2008|archive-date=May 13, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513202441/http://stats.bls.gov/eag/eag.ri.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> The state's nautical history continues in the 21st century in the form of [[nuclear submarine]] construction.

RIPTA bus routes serve 38 of Rhode Island's 39 cities and towns. ([[New Shoreham, Rhode Island|New Shoreham]] on [[Block Island]] is not served). RIPTA operates 58 routes, including daytime trolley service (using trolley-style replica buses) in Providence and Newport.

===Aviation===
{{See also|Aviation in Rhode Island|List of airports in Rhode Island}}

Rhode Island's primary airport for passenger and cargo transport is [[T. F. Green Airport]] in [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Warwick]], though Rhode Islanders who wish to travel internationally on direct flights and those who seek a greater availability of flights and destinations often fly through [[Logan International Airport]] in Boston.

===Limited access highways===
[[File:CAP-ARC-Flight,_Jamestown_and_Newport_bridges.jpg|thumb|The [[Jamestown Verrazzano Bridge]] (foreground) and [[Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge]] (background)|alt=The Jamestown Verrazzano Bridge and Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge]]
[[Interstate 95 in Rhode Island|Interstate 95]] (I-95) runs southwest to northeast across the state, linking Rhode Island with other states along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. [[Interstate 295 (Rhode Island-Massachusetts)|I-295]] functions as a partial [[ring road|beltway]] encircling Providence to the west. [[Interstate 195 (Rhode Island–Massachusetts)|I-195]] provides a limited-access highway connection from Providence (and [[Connecticut]] and New York via I-95) to Cape Cod. Initially built as the easternmost link in the (now cancelled) extension of [[Interstate 84 (east)|I-84]] from [[Hartford, Connecticut]], a portion of [[U.S. Route 6 in Rhode Island|U.S. Route 6]] (US&nbsp;6) through northern Rhode Island is limited-access and links I-295 with downtown Providence.

Several Rhode Island highways extend the state's limited-access highway network. [[Rhode Island Route 4|Route&nbsp;4]] is a major north–south freeway linking Providence and [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Warwick]] (via I-95) with suburban and beach communities along [[Narragansett Bay]]. [[Rhode Island Route 10|Route&nbsp;10]] is an urban [[connector (road)|connector]] linking downtown Providence with [[Cranston (RI)|Cranston]] and [[Johnston, Rhode Island|Johnston]]. [[Rhode Island Route 37|Route&nbsp;37]] is an important east–west freeway through Cranston and Warwick and links I-95 with I-295. [[Rhode Island Route 99|Route&nbsp;99]] links [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island|Woonsocket]] with Providence (via [[Rhode Island Route 146|Route&nbsp;146]]). Route 146 travels through the [[Blackstone Valley]], linking Providence and I-95 with [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] and the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]. [[Rhode Island Route 403|Route&nbsp;403]] links Route&nbsp;4 with [[Quonset Point]].

Several bridges cross [[Narragansett Bay]] connecting [[Aquidneck Island]] and [[Conanicut Island]] to the mainland, most notably the [[Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge]] and the [[Jamestown-Verrazano Bridge]].

===Bicycle paths===

Rhode Island, like the rest of New England, has a tradition of [[clam chowder]]. Both the white New England and the red Manhattan varieties are popular, but there is also a unique clear-broth chowder known as ''Rhode Island Clam Chowder'' available in many restaurants. A culinary tradition in Rhode Island is the ''[[clam cake]]'' (also known as a clam fritter outside of Rhode Island), a deep fried ball of buttery dough with chopped bits of clam inside. They are sold by the half-dozen or dozen in most seafood restaurants around the state, and the quintessential summer meal in Rhode Island is chowder and clam cakes.

The [[hard clam|quahog]] is a large local clam usually used in a chowder. It is also ground and mixed with stuffing or spicy minced sausage, and then baked in its shell to form a ''[[stuffie]]''. [[Calamari]] (squid) is sliced into rings and fried as an appetizer in most Italian restaurants, typically served Sicilian-style with sliced banana peppers and marinara sauce on the side. (In 2014, calamari became the official state appetizer.<ref>{{citation |title= Calamari is now Rhode Island's official appetizer |date= June 27, 2014 |work= abc6.com |agency= AP |url= https://www.abc6.com/calamari-is-now-rhode-islands-official-appetizer/ |access-date= 2020-07-16 |archive-date= July 16, 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200716183351/https://www.abc6.com/calamari-is-now-rhode-islands-official-appetizer/ |url-status= live }}</ref>) [[Clams Casino]] originated in Rhode Island, invented by Julius Keller, the [[Maître d'hôtel|maître d']] in the original Casino next to the seaside Towers in Narragansett.<ref name="Gourmet">Ruth Reichl, John Willoughby, Zanne Early Stewart The Gourmet Cookbook: More Than 1000 Recipes Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2006 {{ISBN|0-618-80692-X}}, 9780618806928

This unique syrup was invented in the state and is sold in almost all Rhode Island supermarkets, as well as its bordering states. [[Johnnycake]]s have been a Rhode Island staple since Colonial times, made with corn meal and water then pan-fried much like pancakes.

Submarine sandwiches are called ''grinders'' throughout Rhode Island, and the Italian grinder, made with cold cuts such as ham, [[prosciutto]], [[capicola]], [[salami]], and [[Provolone cheese]], is especially popular. [[Linguiça]] or [[chouriço]] is a spicy Portuguese sausage often served with peppers and eaten with hearty bread.

The first act of armed rebellion in America against the British Crown was the boarding and burning of the Revenue Schooner ''HMS Gaspée'' in Narragansett Bay on June 10, 1772. The idea of a [[Continental Congress]] was first proposed at a town meeting in Providence on May 17, 1774. Rhode Island elected the first delegates ([[Stephen Hopkins (politician)|Stephen Hopkins]] and [[Samuel Ward (Rhode Island politician)|Samuel Ward]]) to the Continental Congress on June 15, 1774. The Rhode Island General Assembly created the first standing army in the colonies (1,500 men) on April 22, 1775. On June 15, 1775, the first naval engagement took place in the American Revolution between an American sloop commanded by Capt. [[Abraham Whipple]] and an armed tender of the British Frigate ''Rose''. The tender was chased aground and captured. Later in June, the General Assembly created the American Navy when it commissioned the sloops ''[[USS ''Providence'' (1775)#Service as Katy|Katy]]'' and {{USS|Washington|1776 row galley|2}}, armed with 24 guns and commanded by Abraham Whipple who was promoted to Commodore.

===Sports===

====Professional====
Rhode Island is currently home to two professional minor league teams, one being the [[Providence Bruins]] [[ice hockey]] team of the [[American Hockey League]], who are a top-level minor league affiliate of the [[Boston Bruins]]. They play in the [[Amica Mutual Pavilion]] in Providence and won the AHL's [[Calder Cup]] during the [[1998–99 AHL season]]. The other is [[Rhode Island FC]], a [[Association football|soccer]] team that began competing in the second tier [[USL Championship]] in 2024 at [[Beirne Stadium]] located within [[Bryant University]], awaiting the completion of the [[Soccer-specific stadium|soccer-specific]] [[Tidewater Stadium]] in Pawtucket in time for the 2025 season.

[[File:McCoy Stadium Pan.jpg|thumb|upright=2|The [[Pawtucket Red Sox]] played at [[McCoy Stadium]]]]
The [[Pawtucket Red Sox]] baseball team was a [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] [[International League]] affiliate of the [[Boston Red Sox]] from 1973 to 2020. They played at [[McCoy Stadium]] in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island|Pawtucket]] and had won four league titles, the [[Governors' Cup]], in 1973, 1984, 2012, and 2014. McCoy Stadium also has the distinction of being home to the [[longest professional baseball game]] ever played – 33 innings.

The [[Providence Reds]] were a hockey team that played in the [[Canadian–American Hockey League|Canadian-American Hockey League]] (CAHL) from 1926 to 1936, and the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) from 1936 to 1977, the last season of which they played as the Rhode Island Reds. The team won the Calder Cup in 1938, 1940, 1949, and 1956. The Reds played at the Rhode Island Auditorium, on North Main Street in Providence, Rhode Island from 1926 through 1972, when the team affiliated with the New York Rangers and moved into the newly built Providence Civic Center. The team name came from the state bird, a rooster known as the Rhode Island Red. They moved to New York in 1977, then to [[Connecticut]] in 1997, and are now called the [[Hartford Wolf Pack]].

The Reds are the oldest continuously operating minor-league hockey franchise in North America, having fielded a team in one form or another since 1926 in the CAHL. It is also the only AHL franchise to have never missed a season. The AHL returned to Providence in 1992 in the form of the Providence Bruins.

[[File:1884grays.jpg|thumb|1884 Baseball Champion Providence Grays]]
Before the great expansion of athletic teams all over the country, Providence and Rhode Island in general played a great role in supporting teams. The [[Providence Grays]] won the first World Championship in baseball history in 1884. The team played their home games at the old Messer Street Field in Providence. The Grays played in the National League from 1878 to 1885. They defeated the New York Metropolitans of the American Association in a best of five-game series at the Polo Grounds in New York. Providence won three straight games to become the first champions in major league baseball history. [[Babe Ruth]] played for the minor league Providence Grays of 1914 and hit his only official minor league home run for them before the Grays' parent club, the [[Boston Red Sox|Boston Red Stockings]], recalled him.

Rhode Island has deep history with the sport of soccer where the sport was played as early as 1886 when the state's first organized league would be founded, known as the Rhode Island Football Association (RIFA). One of their teams, the Pawtucket Free Wanderers, would establish themselves as a regional power and win the [[American Cup]] in 1893. The first championship game of the [[U.S. Open Cup]] was also held in 1914 in Pawtucket's Coates Field to a crowd of 10,000. Later, a team known as Pawtucket Rangers F.C. would win the [[1941 National Challenge Cup|1941 edition]] of the U.S. Open Cup (then National Challenge Cup). The [[Rhode Island Oceaneers]] would later be founded, and went on to win the [[1974 American Soccer League]] championship. Other former semiprofessional soccer teams of the modern era include the [[Rhode Island Stingrays]] of the [[USL Premier Development League]], and the [[RI Reds|Rhode Island Reds]] of the [[National Premier Soccer League]], with both leagues regarded as the fourth tier of American soccer.

The now-defunct professional football team known as the [[Providence Steamrollers (NFL)|Providence Steamrollers]] won the 1928 NFL title. They played in a 10,000 person stadium called the Cycledrome.<ref>{{cite web |title=NFL History by Decade |work=Nfl.com |url=http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1921-1930#1928 |access-date=January 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410134638/http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1921-1930 |archive-date=April 10, 2016}}</ref> An unrelated basketball team also known as the [[Providence Steamrollers]] played in the [[Basketball Association of America]], which would become the [[National Basketball Association]].

Rhode Island's only [[rugby league]] team was the [[Rhode Island Rebellion]], a semi-professional team that was a founding member of the [[USA Rugby League]], which was at the time the top competition in the United States for the sport of rugby league.<ref name="Bridge">{{cite web|url= http://league13.info/2011/02/18/inaugural-usarl-line-up-announced/|title= Inaugural USARL Line-up Announced|author= Ian Bridge|date= February 18, 2011|website= league13.info|access-date= March 24, 2011|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110809225237/http://league13.info/2011/02/18/inaugural-usarl-line-up-announced/|archive-date= August 9, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usarugbyleague.com/2011/02/usarl-constitution-teams-entry-qualifications-announced/ |title=USARL Constitution & Teams announced |date=February 18, 2011 |website=usarl.com |publisher=USA Rugby League |access-date=March 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513210426/https://www.usarugbyleague.com/2011/02/usarl-constitution-teams-entry-qualifications-announced/ |archive-date=May 13, 2011}}</ref> The Rebellion played their home games at [[Classical High School]] in Providence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rebellion-rugby.com |title=MAIN |publisher=Rebellion-rugby.com |date=June 6, 2012 |access-date=January 26, 2013 |archive-date=June 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614031629/http://rebellion-rugby.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Collegiate and amateur sports====
[[File:Meade_Stadium.jpg|thumb|University of Rhode Island's [[Meade Stadium]] in [[Kingston, Rhode Island|Kingston]]]]
There are four [[NCAA]] Division I schools in Rhode Island. All four schools compete in different conferences. The [[Brown University|Brown University Bears]] compete in the [[Ivy League]], the [[Bryant Bulldogs|Bryant University Bulldogs]] compete in the [[America East Conference]], the [[Providence Friars|Providence College Friars]] compete in the [[Big East Conference]], and the [[Rhode Island Rams|University of Rhode Island Rams]] compete in the [[Atlantic 10 Conference]]. Three of the schools' football teams compete in the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision|Football Championship Subdivision]], the second-highest level of [[college football]] in the United States. Brown plays FCS football in the [[Ivy League]], Bryant plays FCS football in the [[Big South Conference]] before that league merges its football operations with those of the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] in 2023, and Rhode Island plays FCS football in CAA Football, the technically separate football league of the [[Colonial Athletic Association]]. All four Division I schools in the state compete in an intrastate all-sports competition known as the [[Ocean State Cup]], with Bryant winning the most recent cup in 2011–12 academic year.

From 1930 to 1983, [[America's Cup]] races were sailed off Newport, and the extreme-sport [[X Games]] and [[Gravity Games]] were founded and hosted in the state's capital city.

Rhode Island's population barely crosses the threshold beyond the minimum of three for additional votes in both the federal [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; it is well represented relative to its population, with the [[List of U.S. states by population|eighth-highest]] number of electoral votes and [[List of U.S. states by population|second-highest]] number of House Representatives per resident. Based on its area, Rhode Island has the highest density of electoral votes of any state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.270towin.com/states/New_Jersey |title=New Jersey Presidential Election Voting History |publisher=270towin.com |access-date=January 26, 2013 |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117053423/http://www.270towin.com/states/New_Jersey |url-status=live }}</ref>

Federally, Rhode Island is a reliably Democratic state during presidential elections, usually supporting the Democratic presidential nominee. The state voted for the Republican presidential candidate until [[1908 United States presidential election|1908]]. Since then, it has voted for the Republican nominee for president seven times, and the Democratic nominee 17 times. The last 16 presidential elections in Rhode Island have resulted in the Democratic Party winning the Ocean State's Electoral College votes 12 times. In the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 presidential election]], Rhode Island was one of six states to vote against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Ronald Reagan]]. Reagan was the last Republican to win any of the state's counties in a Presidential election until Donald Trump won Kent County in 2016. In 1988, [[George H. W. Bush]] won over 40% of the state's popular vote, something no Republican has done since.

Rhode Island was the Democrats' leading state in 1960, 1964, 1968, 1988 and 2000, and second-best in 1968, 1972, 1996, and 2004. Rhode Island's most one-sided Presidential election result was in 1964, with over 80% of Rhode Island's votes going for [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. In 2004, Rhode Island gave [[John Kerry]] more than a 20-percentage-point margin of victory (the third-highest of any state), with 59.4% of its vote. All but three of Rhode Island's 39 cities and towns voted for the Democratic candidate. The exceptions were East Greenwich, West Greenwich, and Scituate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/cstewart/www/nationwide2004.xls |title=nationwide2004 |author=Stewart, Charles |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|access-date=August 28, 2007|archive-date=November 4, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104111948/http://web.mit.edu/cstewart/www/nationwide2004.xls|url-status=live}} taken from [http://web.mit.edu/cstewart/www/election2004.html web.mit.edu] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817210744/http://web.mit.edu/cstewart/www/election2004.html |date=August 17, 2007 }}</ref> In 2008, Rhode Island gave [[Barack Obama]] a 28-percentage-point margin of victory (the third-highest of any state), with 63% of its vote.
