'''Sầm Sơn''' is a [[resort city]] in [[North Central Coast|north-central]] [[Vietnam]], situated 16&nbsp;km east of [[Thanh Hóa Province]] capital, [[Thanh Hóa]], on the shore of the [[East Sea of Vietnam]].

== History ==
The French colonial rulers began exploiting Sầm Sơn in 1906, and it became a famous place in what was then [[French Indochina]]. At that time, many holiday [[villa]]s were constructed here. In April/May 2007, Sầm Sơn celebrated the 100th anniversary of its establishment by organizing a Sầm Sơn Festival. The Thanh Hóa provincial government invested US$375,000 to upgrade infrastructure along the sea, on water supply, lighting systems and an information network to prepare for the festival. About  22 training courses were organized for 3,000 cyclists, cameramen, vendors and tourist guides. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}
