'''Anyang''' ({{zh|s=安阳|t=安陽}}; {{IPAc-cmn|an|1|.|yang|2}}) is a [[prefecture-level city]] in [[Henan]], China. The northernmost city in Henan, Anyang borders [[Puyang]] to the east, [[Hebi]] and [[Xinxiang]] to the south, and the provinces of [[Shanxi]] and [[Hebei]] to its west and north respectively. Anyang had a total population of 5,477,614 as of the [[2020 Chinese census|2020 census]], 2,675,523 of whom lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of four urban districts and Anyang and Tangyin counties, now largely agglomerated with the city proper.

Anyang is the location of the ancient city of [[Yinxu|Yin]], which was the capital of the [[Shang dynasty]] and the first stable capital of China. Henan once had the largest population in China.{{When|date=September 2024}}

== History ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2022}}

===Early history===
[[File:HouMuWuDingFullView.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Ancient [[Shang dynasty|Shang era]] [[Houmuwu ding]] bronze artifact unearthed at Anyang.]]
Xiaonanhai, on the far western edge of the city, was home to prehistoric cavemen during the [[Stone Age]]. Over 7,000 artifacts (including stone tools and animal bone fossils) have been unearthed here, representing what has been dubbed the Xiaonanhai culture.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Around 2000 BC, the legendary sage-kings [[Zhuanxu]] and [[Emperor Ku]] are said to have established their [[capitals of China|capitals]] in the area around modern Anyang from where they ruled their kingdoms. Today their mausoleums are situated in Sanyang village south of Neihuang County.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

At the beginning of the 14th century BC, King [[Pangeng]] of the [[Shang dynasty]] established his capital {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} north of the modern city on the banks of the [[Huan River]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Anyang: China's Ancient City of Kings |url=https://asia.si.edu/whats-on/exhibitions/anyang-chinas-ancient-city-of-kings/ |access-date=2023-06-04 |website=National Museum of Asian Art |language=en-US}}</ref> The city, known as '''[[Yin (city)|Yin]]''', was the first stable capital in Chinese history and from that point on the dynasty that founded it would also become known as the [[Yin dynasty]].

The capital served 12 kings in 8 generations including [[Wu Ding]], under whom the dynasty reached the zenith of its power, until it was wiped out along with the dynasty that was founded by [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]] of the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] in 1046 BC.

Anyang was made the [[county seat]] of [[Anyang County]] {{circa}} 607 CE and it has held that position ever since.<!-- Xiong 2009, p. 46 --><ref name="Xiong 2009">{{cite book|last=Xiong |first=Victor Cunrui |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UD8Nvn7Ca18C |title=Historical Dictionary of Medieval China |series=''Historical Dictionaries of Ancient Civilizations and Historical Eras'', No. 19 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |location=[[Lanham, Maryland|Lanham]] |date=2009 |isbn=9780810860537 }}</ref>{{rp|46}}

This was also the historic home of [[Zhou Tong (archer)|Zhou Tong]], Yue's military arts tutor (though fictional sources place him in [[Shaanxi]]).

===Modern era===
[[File:PRC-1949-Pingyuan-map.png|left|thumb|The former [[Pingyuan Province]] (1949–52) of which Anyang was a part]]
The town was known as '''Zhangde''' ({{lang|zh|彰德}}) until 1912, when it was given its present name of Anyang,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Anyang Information, Anyang Overview, Anyang Guide, China Guide. |url=https://www.visitourchina.com/anyang/intro.html |access-date=2023-06-04 |website=www.visitourchina.com}}</ref> following the establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]].

In August 1949, Anyang [[Prefecture (China)|prefecture]] was detached from Henan and{{spaced ndash}}along with [[Puyang]] and [[Xinxiang]]{{spaced ndash}}consigned to the short lived experimental province of [[Pingyuan Province|Pingyuan]] by the ruling [[Communist]] government. All three were eventually returned to Henan's territory in November 1953, with the dissolution of Pingyuan.

Anyang city is an ancient city with a history of over 3,000 years and is one of the [[Historical capitals of China|Eight Ancient Capitals of China]], and also one of the best preserved. It is one of the key birthplaces of Chinese ancient culture. Here are the primitive caves of 25,000 years ago, the overlapping [[stratum|strata]] of the [[Yangshao Culture]], [[Longshan Culture]] and Xiaotun Culture, the memorial mausoleums of ancient Emperor [[Zhuanxu]] and [[Emperor Ku]] over 4,000 years ago, the first library of [[oracle bone|inscriptions on bones and tortoise shells]], the Soul Spring Temple, known as the "First Ancient Buddhist Temple in Henan", and 10,000-Buddha Ravine, as well as unique Wenfeng Pagoda, Xiuding Temple Pagoda and Mingfu Temple Pagoda. The city has three large museums: the Anyang Museum, the National Museum of Chinese Writing, and the Yinxu Museum on the ruins and royal tombs of the Shang dynasty. Anyang also has beautiful natural scenery—the Taihang Linlu Hill Scenic Area on the 400-km [[Taihang Mountains]] and the grand 1,500-km [[Red Flag Canal]].

===Wenfeng Pagoda===
Wenfeng Ta (Literature Peak Pagoda) on the grounds of the [[#Tianning Temple|Tianning Temple]] is believed to have been constructed in 925 and is known, from inscriptions concerning the reconstruction of the temple, to have been in place by 952. The current pagoda was constructed during the [[Ming dynasty]] and received its current name during the [[Qing dynasty]] due to its proximity to the Confucian temple. The five-story dark red brick octagonal tower is 38.65m high and is, unusually, larger at the top than the bottom and is topped with a 10-metre Lamaist stupa-style dagoba steeple. The pagoda stands on a two-metre-high stone pedestal and is decorated with multi-eave pent roofs and carvings of Buddhas and bodhisattvas. The unique pagoda is the symbol of Anyang.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}
