'''Cirebon''' ({{IPA|id|t͡ʃirə'bɔn}}, formerly rendered '''Cheribon''' or '''Chirebon''' in English) is a port city on the northern coast of the [[Indonesia]]n island of [[Java island|Java]]. It is the only coastal city of [[West Java]], located about 40&nbsp;km west of the provincial border with [[Central Java]], approximately {{cvt|297|km}} east of [[Jakarta]], at {{Coord|6|43|S|108|34|E|region:ID_type:city}}. It had a population of 296,389 at the 2010 census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 333,303 at the 2020 census;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 341,980 (comprising 171,638 males and 170,342 females).<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Cirebon Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.3274)</ref>

The built-up area of Cirebon reaches out from the city and into the surrounding [[Cirebon Regency|regency of the same name]]; the [[List of metropolitan areas in Indonesia|official metropolitan area]] encompasses the whole of this regency as well as the city, and covers an area of {{cvt|1,116.24|km2}}, with a 2010 census population of 2,363,585; the 2020 census total was 2,603,924<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021" /> and the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 2,702,421.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Cirebon Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.3274)</ref>

Straddling the border between West and Central Java, Cirebon's history has been influenced by both [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] and [[Javanese people|Javanese]] culture as well as [[Arab Indonesians|Arab]] and [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]],<ref name="Turner 229">{{Cite book
  | last = Turner  | first = Peter  | title = Java  | publisher = Lonely Planet  | date = November 1995  | location = Melbourne  | page = 229 | isbn =0-86442-314-4 }}</ref> and is the seat of [[Sultanate of Cirebon|a former Sultanate]].

== Etymology ==
Being on the border of Sundanese (i.e., Western Java) and Javanese (i.e., Central Java) cultural regions, many of Cirebon's residents speak a dialect that is a mix of [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] and [[Javanese language|Javanese]], known as ''Jawareh''. It is thought that the word "Cirebon" derives from the Javanese word, ''caruban'', meaning "mixed": a reference to the city's mix of Sundanese, Javanese, Chinese, and Arabic cultural elements. Alternatively, it could be derived from the Sundanese words "ci" (water or river) and "rebon" ("shrimp").<ref name="Turner 2292"/> (Indeed, the main product of the city is [[fishery|fish]] including [[shrimp]].)

== History ==
{{See also|Sultanate of Cirebon}}

The sultanate court lies near the modern-day city of Cirebon on West Java's northern coast. Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, the sultanate thrived and became an important center in the region for trade, commerce, and Islamic study and dissemination in Java. In 1677, the sultanate split into four royal houses, leaving four [[Kraton (Indonesia)|kratons]] (palaces) in Cirebon; [[Keraton Kasepuhan]], [[Kraton Kanoman]], [[Keraton Kacirebonan]], and Keraton Keprabonan. Each has its own lineage and all are the descendants and stewards of the original Cirebon Sultanate.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}

According to the manuscript ''Purwaka Caruban Nagari'', Cirebon started as a small fishing village in the 15th century named Muara Jati which attracted foreign traders. The port master at that time was Ki Gedeng Alang-Alang, appointed by the king of [[Galuh kingdom]], located inland in Kawali, [[Ciamis Regency|Ciamis]]. He later moved the port to Lemahwungkuk, {{convert|5|km}} to the south. As the new settlement leader, Ki Gedeng Alang-Alang was bestowed with the title "Kuwu Cerbon" (Cerbon village leader).

A 15th-century prince from [[Sunda Kingdom|Pajajaran]], Prince Walangsungsang, converted to Islam and was appointed as the ''Adipati'' (Duke) of Cirebon with the title ''Cakrabumi''. He established the new kingdom of Cirebon and declared independence from Sunda and Galuh. The establishment of the Cirebon Sultanate marked the first Islamic rule in western Java, transforming Muara Jati into a busy port.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cirebonkota.go.id/index.php/profil/sejarah/sejarah-pemerintahan/|title=Profil Sejarah Pemerintahan|publisher=Cirebonkota.go.id}}</ref> Cirebon was an independent sultanate under the leadership of [[Sunan Gunungjati]] in the early 16th century. After the Sunda Kingdom collapsed, the Sultanates of [[Sultanate of Banten|Banten]] and [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]] fought over control of Cirebon, which declared its allegiance to [[Sultan Agung]] of Mataram, whose grandson [[Amangkurat II of Mataram|Amangkurat II]] ceded the city to the Dutch in 1677.<ref name="Turner 2292">{{Cite book|title=Java|last=Turner|first=Peter|date=November 1995|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=0-86442-314-4|location=Melbourne|page=229}}</ref> In 1705, a treaty saw the Cirebon area west of Cisanggarung River become a Dutch protectorate jointly administered by three sultans whose courts rivalled those of Central Java.<ref name="Turner 2292"/> The Dutch authorities later established the Cirebon Residency (''Residentie Tjirebon'') which was composed of present-day Cirebon, Indramayu, and Kuningan.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2dfAAAAcAAJ&q=Residentie+Tjirebon&pg=PA85|title=Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch-Indië|date=1874-01-01|publisher=Lands-Drukkerij|language=nl}}</ref>

During the time of the Dutch "[[Culture System]]" a flourishing trade in colonial cash crops attracted many Chinese entrepreneurs and that influence is still evident in the [[batik]] for which Cirebon is famous.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}<ref name="Turner 2292"/> Cirebon suffered a [[famine]] in 1844, apparently triggered by a combination of [[drought]] and the shift from [[subsistence agriculture]] to cash crops, particularly [[indigo]] and [[sugarcane]], enforced by [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch's]] [[Cultivation System|Cultivation system]].

Although surrounded by Sundanese-speaking areas in West Java, linguists have stated that Cirebon (and the historically related region of [[Serang]] city in [[Banten Province]]) are inside its own Cirebonese language area. In addition, this is supported by a large portion of the Cirebon people referring to themselves as "Wong Cirebon" ("Cirebonese people"), and to their language as "Basa Cirebon" ("Cirebonese"). Cirebonese language is related to Javanese and Banyumasan with dialects such as the ''Jawareh'' (half-Javanese half Sundanese), ''Plered'', and ''Dermayon''. There are also native Sundanese speakers in the city, who speak a local dialect known as ''Bahasa Sunda Cirebon'' (Cirebonese Sundanese language) which contains unique words not found in its Priangan counterpart.{{cn|date=March 2021}}

In the modern era, some of the local political elite in Cirebon and surrounding regencies have campaigned for Cirebon city, together with the regencies of [[Cirebon Regency|Cirebon]], [[Indramayu Regency|Indramayu]], [[Kuningan Regency|Kuningan]] and [[Majalengka Regency|Majalengka]] to be established as a new province - in the same way as [[Banten Province]] was formed by splitting it away from [[West Java]].<ref>Arya Dipa, [http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/05/31/council-urged-endorse-formation-cirebon-province.html Council urged to endorse formation of Cirebon province'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 31 May 2012.</ref> To be a new province it is required that it should be proposed by at least five regencies. Leaders from four of these administrations have given their consent, but [[Majalengka Regency]] has turned down the idea and indicated that it would prefer to stay part of West Java. However, the lack of support from the Majalengka area does not preclude Cirebon city and the other three regencies from continuing to promote the idea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaindonesia.com/read/2012/02/21/299930/289/101/Masyarakat-Majalengka-Tolak-Provinsi-Baru|title=Masyarakat Majalengka Tolak Provinsi Baru|date=February 21, 2012}}</ref>

The potential size and population of this possible Province would be as follows:

== Economy ==
Cirebon City's economy is influenced by its strategic geographical location and by the characteristics of natural resources.  Thus, the structure of its economy is dominated by manufacturing, trade, hotels and restaurants, transport and communications, and service sectors. [[Tomé Pires]] in the [[Suma Oriental]] around the year 1513 mentioned Cirebon was one of the trade centers on the island of [[Java]]. After Cirebon was taken over by the [[Dutch East Indies]] government in 1859, it was designated as a transit port for import-export goods and as a communications route to the political control center for the region in the interior of Java.

Until 2001, the economic contribution to the City of Cirebon was characterized by processing industry (41.32%),
followed by trade, hotels and restaurants (29.8%), transport and communications sector (13.56%), and services sector (6.06%). Other sectors (9.26%) included mining, agriculture, construction, electricity, and gas. Aside from fishery, its harbor, Tanjung Emas, on the [[Java Sea]] has been a major hub for [[timber]] from [[Borneo]].

==Culture==
Cirebon itself is known as ''Grage'' in the Cirebon dialect of Javanese language, which came from the words "'''Negara Gede'''", meaning "Great Kingdom." As a port city, Cirebon attracts visitors and settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia and from other nations as well. Cirebon culture was described as Java ''Pasisiran'' (coastal) culture, similar to the cultures of Banten, Pekalongan, and Semarang, with notable mixtures of Sundanese, Chinese, Arabic-Islamic, and European influences.

=== Arts and crafts ===
[[File:Batik Mega Mendung.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A Megamendung batik motif from Cirebon.]]
[[Batik]] textiles from Cirebon, especially Cirebon batik with vivid colors with motifs and patterns, that demonstrate Chinese and local influences, are well known. Chinese influences can be seen in Cirebon's culture, most notably the Cirebon batik ''Megamendung'' pattern that resembles Chinese cloud imagery. The [[Trusmi Batik Village|Trusmi]] area is the production center of Cirebon batik. Cirebon Glass Painting is another aspect of Cirebon arts and crafts. The imagery in glass painting is usually derived from [[wayang]] theme to [[Islamic calligraphy]].

=== Performing arts ===
[[File:Tari_topeng_cirebon.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Cirebon mask dance]]]]
The [[Cirebon mask dance|Tari Topeng Cirebon]], or Cirebon mask dance, is a dance style peculiar to the city. [[Topeng]] Cirebon mask dance, inspired by Javanese [[Panji (prince)|Panji]] cycles is one of notable Cirebon traditional dance and quite famous within [[Indonesian dance]]s.

Cirebon culture is also influenced by Islamic Middle Eastern culture, such as the ''Burokan'' tradition where people exhibit the image of [[buraq]] — traditionally made from the bamboo frame and paper skin, or other materials — in processions around the village accompanied with music. The traditions of the bamboo statues borne in these processions are similar to Sundanese ''Sisingaan'', Betawi ''[[Ondel-ondel]]'', or Balinese ''[[Ogoh-ogoh]]'' processions, yet differ in their Islamic theme. ''Burokan'' are usually held during festive occasions such as circumcision or marriage, and are accompanied by popular Cirebon folk songs, such as ''tarling.''

'''Tarling''' is a musical tradition reminiscent of Bandung's ''kecapi suling'' music with except that it features guitar, ''[[suling]]'' (bamboo flute) and voice.<ref name="Turner 229"/> The name derived from ''gi'''tar''''' (guitar), and ''su'''ling''''' (flute).

===Sports===

Each still holds their traditional ceremonies and have become the patrons of Cirebon arts. Some of the royal symbols of the Cirebon Sultanate describe their legacy and influences. The banner of Cirebon Sultanate is called "Macan Ali" (Ali's panther) with Arabic calligraphy arranged to resemble a [[Panthera|panther]] or [[tiger]]. These indicate both Islamic influence and that of the Hindu Pajajaran Sundanese King Siliwangi's tiger banner.  The royal lineage of Cirebon is still well respected and is held in high prestige among the people of Cirebon, although it does not hold real political power anymore.

The royal carriage of Kasepuhan's Singa Barong and Kanoman's Paksi Naga Liman carriage resembles the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]] of three animals; eagle, elephant, and dragon. These symbolize Indian Hinduism, Arabic Islam, and Chinese influences. The images of Macan Ali, Singa Barong, and Paksi Naga Liman are also often featured as patterns in Cirebon batik.

=== Cuisine ===
As a coastal city, Cirebon's main industry is fishery. Its products include ''[[terasi]]'' (shrimp paste), ''[[petis]]'', ''krupuk udang'' ([[shrimp crackers]]) and various [[salted fish]]. Cirebon is famous for its high quality salted fish, such as ''jambal roti'', ''juhi'' (salted cuttlefish), ''rebon'', and ''ebi'' (dried small shrimp). These products are often sought by visitors, especially Indonesian domestic tourists and visitors from other cities, as ''oleh-oleh'' (food souvenirs).

Cirebon is also known for its local cuisines and delicacies, such as ''[[empal gentong]]'' (offal curry ), ''[[mie koclok]]'' (chicken noodle soup with coconut milk), ''[[nasi lengko]]'' (rice with bean sprouts, fried [[tofu]], and fried [[tempeh]], topped with [[peanut sauce]] and [[soy sauce]]), ''[[nasi jamblang]]'' (rice of various side dishes), ''[[tahu gejrot]]'' (fried tofu with ground garlic, chili, and shallot, topped with thin and sweet soy sauce), ''tahu petis'' (dry fried tofu served with [[petis]] dip sauce), ''tahu tek-tek'' (fried tofu topped with peanut sauce and mixed with vegetables), ''ayam panggang'' (barbecued chicken), and ''[[docang]]'' ([[lontong]] with sour vegetable soup).
