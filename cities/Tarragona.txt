'''Tarragona''' ({{IPA|ca|tərəˈɣonə|lang}}, {{IPA|es|taraˈɣona|lang|Pronunciation_of_Tarragona_in_Spanish.ogg}}; {{langx|la|Tarraco}}) is a [[coast]]al city and municipality in [[Catalonia]] ([[Spain]]). It is the capital and largest town of [[Tarragonès]] county, the [[Camp de Tarragona]] region and the [[province of Tarragona]]. Geographically, it is located on the [[Costa Daurada]] area on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] shore.

During the period of the [[Roman Empire]], it was one of the most prominent cities of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], as the capital, successively, of the Roman provinces of [[Hispania Citerior]] and [[Hispania Tarraconensis]].

The [[Archaeological Ensemble of Tárraco|Archaeological Complex of Tàrraco]] is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

==History==
{{Main article|Tarraco}}

===Origins===
One Catalan legend holds that Tarragona was named for ''Tarraho'', eldest son of [[Tubal]] in c. 2407 BC; another (derived from Strabo and [[Megasthenes]]) attributes the name to '[[Taharqa|Tearcon]] the Ethiopian', a seventh-century BC pharaoh who campaigned in Spain.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_ya_kSC4IsiEC#page/n137/mode/2up/search/taraco |title=Los cinco libros primeros dela Coronica general de España, que recopilaua el maestro Florian de Ocampo |year=1578 |publisher=en casa de Iuan Iñiguez de Lequerica}}</ref> The real founding date of Tarragona is unknown.

The city's origins trace back to a possible Iberian settlement known as Kesse or Kosse, named after the local Iberian tribe, the Cossetans. However, the exact connection of Tarragona to Kesse remains uncertain.<ref>{{cite book |author=Silvia Orvietani Busch |title=Medieval Mediterranean Ports: The Catalan and Tuscan Coasts, 1100 to 1235 |publisher=BRILL |year=2001 |isbn=90-04-12069-6 |page=53}}</ref> Scholars such as [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] suggest that the city may have been established by the [[Phoenicia]]ns, who referred to it as {{lang|phn|Tarchon}}. According to [[Samuel Bochart]], signifies a citadel. The moniker likely stemmed from its location atop a high rock, approximately {{cvt|75|-|90|m|-1}} above sea level; earning it the epithet {{lang|la|arce potens Tarraco}}.<ref>Ausonius ''Class. Urb.'' 9; cf. ''Mart''. x. 104.</ref> It was seated on the river Sulcis or Tulcis (modern [[Francolí (river)|Francolí]]), on a bay of the Mare Internum (Mediterranean), between the Pyrenees and the River Iberus (modern [[Ebro]]).<ref>[[Mela]], ii. 6; [[Pliny the Elder]] iii. 3. s. 4.</ref> [[Livy]] mentions a {{lang|la|portus Tarraconis}};<ref>xxii. 22</ref> and according to [[Eratosthenes]] it had a naval station or roads ({{lang|grc|Ναύσταθμον}});<ref>''ap.'' [[Strabo]] iii. p. 159</ref> but [[Artemidorus Ephesius]] says with more probability that it had none, and scarcely even an anchoring place; and Strabo himself refers to it as "harbourless" ({{lang|grc|ἀλίμενος}}).<ref>''ap.'' Strab. ''l. c.''; [[Polybius]] iii. 76</ref><ref>Ford's Handbook of Spain, p. 222.</ref>

===Rome===
Tarraco lies on the main road along the northeastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula.<ref name=AntIt>[[Antonine Itinerary]] pp. 391, 396, 399, 448, 452.</ref> During the [[Roman Republic]], the city was fortified and much enlarged as a Roman colony by the brothers [[Publius Cornelius Scipio (consul 218 BC)|Publius Cornelius Scipio]] and [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus]], who converted it into a fortress and arsenal against the [[ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]]. The city was first named [[Tarraco|Colonia Iulia Urbs Triumphalis Tarraco]] and was capital of the province of [[Hispania Citerior]]. Subsequently, it became the capital (''[[conventus iuridicus]]''<ref>Pliny ''l. c.''; [[Tacitus]] ''Ann''. i. 78; [[Gaius Julius Solinus]] 23, 26; Polybius x. 34; Livy xxi. 61; [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] p. 637.</ref>) of the province named after it, [[Hispania Tarraconensis]].<ref>[[Ptolemy]], ii. 6. § 17</ref>

[[Augustus]] wintered at Tarraco after his Cantabrian campaign, and bestowed many marks of honour on the city, among which were its honorary titles of ''Colonia Victrix Togata'' and ''Colonia Julia Victrix Tarraconensis''.

According to Mela, it was the richest town on the coast,<ref name="l. c">''l. c.''</ref> and Strabo represents its population as equal to that of Carthago Nova (now [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]]).<ref name="l. c"/> Its fertile plain and sunny shores are celebrated by [[Martial]] and other poets; and its neighbourhood is described as producing good wine and [[flax]].<ref>Mart. x. 104, xiii. 118; Sil. Ital. iii. 369, xv. 177; Plin. xiv. 6. s. 8, xix. 1. s. 2.</ref> The city also minted coins.<ref>Grut. ''Inscr''. p. 382; Orelli, no. 3127; coins in Eckhel, i. p. 27; [[Enrique Flórez]], ''Med.'' ii. p. 579; Théodore Edme Mionnet, i. p. 51, Suppl. i. p. 104; Sestini, p. 202.</ref>

An inscribed stone base for a now lost statue of [[Tiberius Claudius Candidus]] was found in Tarragona during the nineteenth century. The 24-line Latin inscription describes the governor and senator's career as an ally of the future Roman emperor [[Septimius Severus]], who fought in the civil war following the assassination of [[Commodus]] in 192 AD. This important marble block was purchased by the [[British Museum]] in 1994.<ref>{{CIL|2|4114}}; [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=443817&partId=1&searchText=Tarragona&page=2 British Museum Collection] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326124011/http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=443817&partId=1&searchText=Tarragona&page=2 |date=26 March 2017 }}</ref>

===From the demise of the Roman empire to the Union of Spain===

After the demise of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the city was captured by the [[Vandals]] and the [[Visigoths]]. The [[Visigothic Kingdom]]'s rule of Tarracona was ended by the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] in 714. It was an important border city of the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]] between 750 and 1013. After the demise of the Caliphate, it was part of the [[Taifa of Zaragoza]] between 1013 and 1110 and under the control of the [[Almoravid dynasty]] between 1110 and 1117. It was taken by the [[County of Barcelona]] in 1117. From 1129 to 1173 Tarragona was the capital of the short lived [[Principality of Tarragona]], under the [[Normans|Norman]]-influence. After the dynastic union of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[County of Barcelona|Barcelona]], it was part of the [[Principality of Catalonia]] within the [[Crown of Aragon]] from 1164 to 1714. After dynastic union of [[Aragon]] and the [[Crown of Castile]], it remained a part of the Crown of Aragon until the foundation of the [[Spanish Empire]] in 1516.

During the [[Reapers' War]], Tarragona was captured by Catalan insurgents with French support in 1641, but it was retaken by Spanish troops in 1644. It was captured by allied Portuguese, Dutch, and British troops in 1705 during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and remained in their hands until the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713. During the war, the Catalans supported the unsuccessful claim of [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen]] against the victorious [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] [[Counts and dukes of Anjou#Dukes of Anjou|Duke of Anjou]], who became [[Philip V of Spain]]. He signed the [[Nueva Planta decrees]], which abolished the [[Crown of Aragon]], as well as the Catalan institutions and prohibited the administrative use of Catalan language on 16 January 1716.

===Jewish History===
The [[Jewish]] community in Tarragona was established during the Roman era, making it one of the most ancient Jewish communities in Spain. A ''laver'', possibly used by the Jews for [[ritual purification]] found in Tarragona bears the inscription "peace over Israel, over ourselves, and our children." Coins with [[Hebrew]] inscriptions have also been found, dating to the Visigoth period. During Muslim rule, Jews in Tarragona prospered; [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] nicknamed Tarragona "the city of the Jews."

After the Christian reconquest, the Jews of Tarragona faced institutional persecution and anti-semitic restrictions until the community's destruction in 1492, during the [[expulsion of the Jews from Spain|expulsion of the Jews]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Tarragona |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/tarragona |website=Jewish Virtual Library |access-date=1 July 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Kayserling |first1=Meyer |last2=Gottheil |first2=Richard |title=TARRAGONA |url=https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14251-tarragona |website=Jewish Encyclopedia |access-date=1 July 2024}}</ref>

===Peninsular War===
During the [[Peninsular War]], in the first [[Siege of Tarragona (1811)|siege of Tarragona]] from 5 May to 29 June 1811, [[Louis-Gabriel Suchet]]'s Army of Aragon of the [[First French Empire]] laid siege to a Spanish garrison led by Lieutenant General [[Juan de Contreras]]. A British naval squadron commanded by Admiral [[Edward Codrington]] harassed the French besiegers with cannon fire and transported large numbers of reinforcements into the city by sea. Nevertheless, Suchet's troops stormed into the defences and killed or captured almost all the defenders. It became a subprefecture centre in [[Bouches-de-l'Èbre]] department of French empire.

In the second [[Siege of Tarragona (1813)|siege of Tarragona]] (3–11 June 1813), an overwhelming Anglo-Spanish force under the command of Lieutenant general [[John Murray, 8th Baronet]] failed to wrest Tarragona from a small Franco-Italian garrison led by Brigadier general [[Antoine Marc Augustin Bertoletti]]. Murray was subsequently removed from command for his indecisive and contradictory leadership. The Anglo-Spanish forces finally captured Tarragona on 19 August.

===Spanish Civil War===

During the [[Spanish Civil War]], Tarragona was in the hands of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] until captured by [[Francoist Spain|Franco's Nationalist troops]] on 15 January 1939 during the [[Catalonia Offensive]].

==Main sights==

===Ancient remains===
[[File:Amphithéâtre de Tarragona.jpg|thumb|Amphitheatre of Tarragona and the Mediterranean Sea]]

The Roman ruins of Tarraco have been designated a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].

Part of the bases of large [[Cyclopean masonry|Cyclopean]] walls near the Cuartel de Pilatos are thought to pre-date the Romans. The building just mentioned, a prison in the 19th century, is said to have been the palace of Augustus. The second century [[Tarragona Amphitheatre]] near the seashore was extensively used as a quarry after the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], and but few vestiges of it now remain. A circus c. {{cvt|450|m}} long, was built over in the area now called ''Plaça de la Font'', though portions of it are still to be traced. Throughout the town [[Latin]], and even apparently [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]], inscriptions on the stones of the houses mark the material used for buildings in the town.

Two ancient monuments, at some little distance from the town, have, however, fared rather better. The first of these is [[Les Ferreres Aqueduct]], which spans a valley about {{cvt|4|km|0|abbr=off}} north of the city. It is {{cvt|217|m|0}} in length, and the loftiest arches, of which there are two tiers, are {{cvt|26|m|0}} high. There is a monument about {{cvt|6|km|0}} along the coast road east of the city, commonly called the "Tower of the Scipios"; but there is no authority for assuming that they were buried here.<ref>(''Cf.'' Ford, ''Handbook'', p. 219, ''seq''.; Florez, ''Esp. Sagr.'' xxix. p. 68, ''seq.''; Miñano, ''Diccion.'' viii. p. 398.)

Other Roman buildings include:
*[[Wall of Tarragona|The Roman walls]]
*The capitol, or citadel
*The Amphitheatre
*The Roman circus
*The Pretorium – Tower
*The [[Provincial forum of Tarraco|Provincial]] and [[Colonial forum of Tarraco|Colonial fora]]
*The Necropolis 
*The palace of Augustus, called the house of Pilate
*The so-called tower, or sepulchre, of the Scipios
*Arch of Sura, or of Bara
*The Aurelian Way.

The city is also home to the [[National Archaeological Museum of Tarragona]].

===Religious buildings===
[[File:Cathedral of Tarragona 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Tarragona Cathedral]]
*The [[Tarragona Cathedral]], dating to the 12th–13th centuries, combining Romanesque and Gothic architectural elements.
*The convent of the [[Poor Clares]], near the walls
*The convent of ''Santa Teresa''
*The church of the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin]], the parish church of the port
*The former convent of ''Sant Francesc''
*The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] college was turned into barracks; their church, however, has been restored to them
*The convent of the [[Dominican Order]], now the town hall
*The archiepiscopal palace, situated on the site of the ancient capitol, one tower of which still remains. It was rebuilt in the 19th century.
*Near the sea, in the Roman amphitheatre, are the remains of a church called ''Santa Maria del Miracle'' (Holy Mary of the Miracle), which belonged to the [[Knights Templar]]. It was afterwards used by the [[Trinitarian Order]] and was later converted into a penitentiary. It was demolished around 1915.<ref>Comisión de Antigüedades de la Real Academia de la Historia: catálogo e índices, Cataluña. Page 256. Published in Spanish, 2000.</ref>

The seminary of Sant Pau and Santa Tecla was founded in 1570 by the cardinal archbishop, [[Gaspar Cervantes de Gaeta]], and was the first to comply with the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]]. In 1858 Archbishop [[José Domingo Costa y Borrás]] built a fourth wing. [[Benito Villamitjana]] built a new seminary behind the cathedral in 1886, in the courtyard of which stands the old chapel of Sant Pau. [[Pope Leo XIII]] raised this to the rank of a pontifical university.

{{cvt|50|km|2}} north of the city is [[Poblet Monastery]], founded in 1151 by [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona]], which was used for sepultures of the [[List of Aragonese monarchs|kings]].

==Modern Tarragona==
[[File:Plaza del Forum, Tarragona.jpg|thumb|Plaça del Fòrum.]]
Tarragona is home to one of the largest [[List of coastal settlements of the Mediterranean Sea|ports]] in Spain, which is an export hub for the Spanish car industry.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Port of Tarragona Profile {{!}} Tank News International |url=https://tanknewsinternational.com/port-of-tarragona-profile/ |access-date=2024-03-13 |language=en-GB}}</ref> Much of its economic activity comes from a number of chemical industries located west of the city. Among other educational institutions, it also features the [[Rovira i Virgili University]].

The most significant living heritage is the Popular Retinue, a great parade of dances, bestiary and spoken dances, as well as the building of human towers called [[Castell|castells]]. These cultural traditional are especially visible during the [[Santa Tecla Festival]], and are so popular in Tarragona that they have their own home called the "Casa de la Festa", Festivities House, which can be visited all year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tarragona.cat/cultura/festes-i-cultura-popular/santa-tecla/fans-tecla/casa-de-la-festa|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130115160343/http://casafesta.tarragona.cat/|url-status=dead|title=Casa de la Festa|archive-date=15 January 2013|website=www.tarragona.cat}}</ref>

A number of beaches, some awarded a [[Blue Flag beach|Blue Flag]] designation, line the Mediterranean coast near the city.

Tarragona is located near the [[resort]] of [[Salou]] and the [[PortAventura World]] ([[PortAventura Park]], the most visited theme park in Spain,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Themed Entertainment Association |author-link=Themed Entertainment Association |author2=Economics Research Associates |title=Global Attractions Attendance Report |publisher=AECOM |year=2013 |url=http://www.aecom.com/deployedfiles/Internet/Capabilities/Economics/_documents/ThemeMuseumIndex_2013.pdf |access-date=4 October 2015 |archive-date=30 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151030020018/http://www.aecom.com/deployedfiles/Internet/Capabilities/Economics/_documents/ThemeMuseumIndex_2013.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Ferrari Land]] and also the [[PortAventura World#PortAventura Caribe Aquatic Park|PortAventura Caribe Aquatic Park]]).

The city is served by [[Camp de Tarragona railway station|Camp de Tarragona high-speed railway station]], and is located a few kilometres away from [[Reus Airport]], which offers low-cost charter-flights (over a million passengers per year).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://automotivelogistics.media/home-page/tarragona-ports-five-year-high-means-room-berge |title=Tarragona port's five-year high means more room for Bergé |work=Automotive Logistics |date=24 February 2017 |access-date=24 February 2017 |archive-date=25 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225132659/http://automotivelogistics.media/home-page/tarragona-ports-five-year-high-means-room-berge |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Reus]] is the second city of the Tarragona area (101,767 inhabitants in 2006), known by its commercial activity and for being the place where the architect [[Antoni Gaudí]] was born.

The city hosted the [[2018 Mediterranean Games]], one year later than planned, because of political and economical instability.<ref>{{cite news |title=Confirmat l'ajornament dels Jocs Mediterranis de Tarragona fins al 2018 |url=http://www.ara.cat/societat/Confirmat-ajornament-jocs-mediterranis-tarragona-2017-2018_0_1681632064.html |access-date=11 December 2016 |agency=Agència Catalan de Notícies |publisher=Diari Ara |archive-date=20 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220121201/http://www.ara.cat/societat/Confirmat-ajornament-jocs-mediterranis-tarragona-2017-2018_0_1681632064.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Food and drink ==
[[File:Building_of_historical_Chartreuse_factory_in_Tarragona.jpg|thumb|Historical building of early 20th century factory of Chartreuse liqueur in Tarragona]]
Tarragona contains a number of small bars, restaurants, and cafes serving tapas and sandwiches, and local seafood and Catalan dishes like "[[pa amb tomàquet]]" or "neules i torrons". Many such outlets are found in the historic centre, including those at the Plaça de la Font, Plaça del Rei and Plaça del Fòrum. The neighborhood of El Serrallo, at the harbour, specialises in seafood cuisine.

[[Chartreuse (liqueur)|Chartreuse liqueur]] is a famous local drink of Tarragona. Originally created in 1605, it was considered by monks to be an “elixir for long life”. It is produced in yellow, with an alcohol content of 40º, as well as green, with a content of 55º. Between 1903 and 1989, the Chartreuse liqueur made by the French [[Carthusians|Carthusian Monks]] was distilled in Tarragona, following the monks' expulsion from France.<ref>[https://www.chartreuse.fr/en/histoire/the-chartreuse-distilleries/ Chartreuse distilleries] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303073809/https://www.chartreuse.fr/en/histoire/the-chartreuse-distilleries/ |date=3 March 2016 }}</ref> Chartreuse is now a key part of the Feast of Santa Tecla.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-10-10 |title=Santa Tecla, Tarragona y Chartreuse |url=http://otcgroup.es/santa-tecla-chartreuse/ |access-date=2022-01-02 |website=OTC Group |language=es-ES |archive-date=2 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220102112018/http://otcgroup.es/santa-tecla-chartreuse/ |url-status=live }}</ref> This traditional festival of national interest celebrates the patroness saint of the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tarragona.cat/cultura/festes-i-cultura-popular/santa-tecla/santa-tecla-tarragona|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220102112018/https://www.tarragona.cat/cultura/festes-i-cultura-popular/santa-tecla|url-status=dead|title=Santa Tecla Tarragona|archive-date=2 January 2022|website=www.tarragona.cat}}</ref>

==Politics==
The local mayor is elected by the members of the plenary from among its members the day the new municipal corporation is formed after the local election. The officeholder has a mandate for the 4-year duration of the elected body. If the mayor leaves office ahead of time a new voting may take place among the plenary members in order to invest a new mayor (meanwhile, another local councillor, conventionally the first deputy mayor may act as acting mayor). Since 15 June 2019 the mayor is [[Pau Ricomà]].<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.lavanguardia.com/local/tarragona/20190615/462878201057/pau-ricoma-alcalde-tarragona-coalicion-comu-podem.html |journal=[[La Vanguardia]] |title=Pau Ricomà, de ERC, pone fin a doce años de gobierno del socialista Ballesteros en Tarragona |date=2019-06-15 |first=Sara |last=Sans |access-date=18 July 2020 |archive-date=8 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200808012208/https://www.lavanguardia.com/local/tarragona/20190615/462878201057/pau-ricoma-alcalde-tarragona-coalicion-comu-podem.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The opening session in which the mayor is invested is traditionally held at the ''Saló de Plens''.

;List of mayors

It is formed by the municipal councillors, elected through [[Closed list|closed party list]] [[proportional representation]] and 27 councillors are currently elected on the basis of the population of the municipality. Councillors are grouped in municipal groups on the basis of their political filiation. It has a government commission (''Comissió de Govern''; also ''Junta de Govern'' or ''Junta de Gobierno'') is formed by the mayor, the deputy mayors, and a number of appointed councillors.
