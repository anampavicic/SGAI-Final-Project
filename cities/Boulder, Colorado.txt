==History==
{{For timeline}}
Archaeological evidence shows that Boulder Valley has been continuously inhabited by Native American tribes for over 13,000 years, beginning in the late Pleistocene era. Throughout the Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods, Indigenous peoples moved seasonally between the mountains and plains, taking shelter in winter along the Front Range trough where Boulder now lies. By the 1500s, the area was occupied by Ute tribes, joined by Arapaho tribes in the early 1800s.<ref name="COEncyclopedia">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Boulder, Colorado |url=https://coloradoencyclopedia.org/article/boulder |encyclopedia=Colorado Encyclopedia |access-date=October 17, 2023 |archive-date=June 7, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230607012937/https://coloradoencyclopedia.org/article/boulder |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Indigenous Nations who have ties to the Boulder Valley include the [[Apache]], [[Arapaho]], [[Cheyenne]], [[Comanche]], [[Kiowa]], [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]], [[Shoshone]], [[Sioux]], and [[Ute people|Ute]] peoples. In the 1800s, Euro-American settlers colonized the area.<ref>{{cite web |website=City of Boulder |title=Boulder Land Acknowledgment |url=https://bouldercolorado.gov/projects/staff-land-acknowledgment|access-date=October 17, 2023}}</ref>

Modern Boulder was founded in late 1858 when prospectors led by Thomas Aikins arrived at Boulder Canyon during the Colorado Gold Rush. Arapaho leader Niwot allowed them to stay for the winter, but the settlers abused this peaceful approach, and some later took part in the [[Sand Creek massacre]] of Arapaho.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Drugan |first=Tim |date=2022-12-16 |title=Southern Arapaho elder says Boulder should amend Fort Chambers sign but leave it up |url=http://boulderreportinglab.org/2022/12/15/fred-mosqueda-in-his-own-words-southern-arapaho-elder-says-boulder-should-amend-fort-chambers-sign-but-leave-it-up/ |access-date=2024-07-09 |website=The Boulder Reporting Lab |language=en-US |archive-date=July 9, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240709125837/https://boulderreportinglab.org/2022/12/15/fred-mosqueda-in-his-own-words-southern-arapaho-elder-says-boulder-should-amend-fort-chambers-sign-but-leave-it-up/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In early 1859, gold was discovered along Boulder Creek, drawing more miners and merchants to the area. The Boulder City Town Company was formed in February 1859 to establish a settlement at the canyon mouth. By 1860, it had 70 cabins, occupied mainly by Anglo families. Non-whites like Chinese miners and black residents were part of early Boulder but rarely pictured.<ref name="COEncyclopedia"/>

In 1861, Boulder County was created, and the Arapaho were forced to relocate per the Treaty of Fort Wise. With declining numbers, Niwot's band soon moved to the Cheyenne-Arapaho Reservation. By 1862, the creek had yielded $100,000 in gold, and Boulder's population exceeded 300.

On November 7, 1861, the [[Colorado General Assembly]] passed legislation to locate the University of Colorado in Boulder.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.colorado.edu/catalog/2013-14/information/intro|title = University of Colorado History|website = University of Colorado |access-date = February 10, 2016|archive-date = July 17, 2017|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170717215550/http://www.colorado.edu/catalog/2013-14/information/intro|url-status = live}}</ref> On September 20, 1875, the first cornerstone was laid for the first building (Old Main) on the CU campus.

In 1959, city voters approved the "Blue Line" city-charter amendment, which restricted city water service to altitudes below {{convert|5750|ft|m}}, to protect the mountain backdrop from development. In 1967, city voters approved a dedicated sales tax to acquire open space to contain [[urban sprawl]]. In 1970, Boulder created a "comprehensive plan" to dictate future zoning, transportation, and urban planning decisions. Hoping to preserve residents' views of the mountains, in 1972, the city enacted an ordinance limiting the height of newly constructed buildings. In 1974, a Historic Preservation Code was passed. In 1976, a ''residential-growth management'' ordinance, the Danish Plan, was passed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Historic Preservation Program Background |url=https://bouldercolorado.gov/planning/historic-preservation-program-background |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025214639/https://bouldercolorado.gov/planning/historic-preservation-program-background |archive-date=October 25, 2013 |access-date=September 3, 2012 |website=City of Boulder}}</ref><ref name="boulder1">{{cite web |title=Did You Know?...

[[File:Flatirons Winter Sunrise edit 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Boulder's rock formations, the [[Flatirons]]]]

The city of Boulder is located in the Boulder Valley, where the [[Rocky Mountains]] meet the [[Great Plains]]. The [[Flatirons]], slabs of sedimentary stone tilted up on the foothills, are located west of the city and are a widely recognized symbol of Boulder.<ref name="Reilly-McNellan">{{cite web|url=http://www-static.bouldercolorado.gov/docs/history-of-mt-parks-mary-reilly-mcnellan-1-201305101210.pdf|author=Mary Reilly-McNellan|title=History of Boulder Mountain Parks|access-date=October 2, 2013|archive-date=September 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200923195415/https://www-static.bouldercolorado.gov/docs/history-of-mt-parks-mary-reilly-mcnellan-1-201305101210.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[Boulder Creek (Colorado)|Boulder Creek]] is the primary flow of water through Boulder. The creek was named before the city's founding for all of the large granite boulders that have cascaded into the creek over the eons.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}} It is from Boulder Creek that the city is believed to have taken its name.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}} Boulder Creek has significant water flow, derived primarily from snow melt and minor springs west of the city.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}} The creek flows into [[St. Vrain Creek]] east of [[Longmont, Colorado|Longmont]], which is a tributary of the [[South Platte River]].

At the [[2020 United States Census]], the city had a total area of {{convert|70.877|km2|acre|order=flip}}, including {{convert|2.689|km2|acre|order=flip}} of water.<ref name=2020_Census/>

The [[40th parallel north|40th parallel]], 40 degrees north latitude, runs through Boulder and can be easily recognized as [[Baseline Road (Colorado)|Baseline Road]] today.

Boulder lies in a wide basin beneath [[Flagstaff Mountain, Boulder, Colorado|Flagstaff Mountain]] just a few miles east of the continental divide and about {{convert|25|mi|km}} northwest of Denver. Arapahoe Glacier provides water for the city, along with Boulder Creek, which flows through the center of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bcn.boulder.co.us/basin/ |title=Boulder Area Sustainability Information Network |publisher=Boulder Community Network |date=August 27, 1999 |access-date=December 9, 2010 |archive-date=September 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928141035/http://bcn.boulder.co.us/basin/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1899, government preservation of open space around Boulder began, with the [[Congress of the United States]] approving the allocation of {{convert|1800|acre|km2}} of mountain backdrop/watershed extending from South Boulder Creek to Sunshine Canyon.

====Wildlife protection====
Boulder has created an Urban Wildlife Management Plan which sets policies for managing and protecting urban wildlife.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bouldercolorado.gov/wildlife/ |title=Urban Wildlife |publisher=Bouldercolorado.gov |access-date=July 23, 2013 |archive-date=October 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026005308/https://bouldercolorado.gov/wildlife |url-status=live }}</ref> The city's Parks and Recreation and Open Space and Mountain Parks departments have volunteers who monitor parks, including wetlands, lakes, etc., to protect ecosystems.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bouldercolorado.gov/parks-rec/parks-volunteer-opportunities |title=Park Volunteer Opportunities |publisher=Bouldercolorado.gov |date=September 25, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026003354/https://bouldercolorado.gov/parks-rec/parks-volunteer-opportunities |archive-date=October 26, 2013 }}</ref> From time to time, parks and hiking trails are closed to conserve or restore ecosystems.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bouldercolorado.gov/osmp/closures |title=OSMP closures |publisher=Bouldercolorado.gov |access-date=July 23, 2013 |archive-date=August 24, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824033822/https://bouldercolorado.gov/osmp/closures |url-status=live }}</ref>
Traditionally, Boulder has avoided using chemical [[pesticides]] to control the insect population. However, with the threat of [[West Nile virus]], the city began an integrative plan<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060306113749/http://www.ci.boulder.co.us/environmentalaffairs/ipm/documents/FinalWNVMosquitoPlan.pdf]</ref> to control the mosquito population in 2003 that includes chemical pesticides.

Under Boulder law, exterminating [[prairie dogs]] requires a permit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://user.govoutreach.com/boulder/faq.php?cid=23415 |title=Prairie Dogs & Wild Birds Wildlife Protection Ordinance |publisher=City of Boulder |date=January 18, 2005 |access-date=December 9, 2010 |archive-date=June 30, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630092111/http://user.govoutreach.com/boulder/faq.php?cid=23415 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2005, the city experimented with using goats for weed control in environmentally sensitive areas. Goats naturally consume diffuse [[knapweed]] and [[Canada thistle]], and although the program was not as effective as it was hoped, goats will still be considered in future weed control projects. In 2010, goats were used to keep weeds under control at the Boulder Reservoir.<ref>{{cite news

[[File:Boulder after a snowfall..JPG|thumb|left|Snowfall is common in Boulder throughout the winter.]]
Boulder has a temperate climate typical for much of the state and receives many sunny or mostly sunny days each year. Boulder is considered [[semi-arid]] (Köppen: ''BSk'') or [[humid subtropical]] (Köppen: ''Cfa'') within the [[Köppen climate classification]] due to its relatively high yearly precipitation and average temperatures remaining above {{convert|32|F|C}} year-round.<ref name="weather.gov">{{cite web |url=https://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=bou |title=Denver/Boulder Weather Forecast Office |access-date=August 10, 2015 |archive-date=May 8, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210508060530/https://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=bou |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Zipcode 80303 – Boulder Colorado is in Hardiness Zones 5b and 6a|website=PlantMaps|access-date=March 21, 2020|url=https://www.plantmaps.com/80303|archive-date=December 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191216034535/https://www.plantmaps.com/80303|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Boulder, Colorado|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=51137&cityname=Boulder%2C+Colorado%2C+United+States+of+America&units=|access-date=March 21, 2020|website=weatherbase|archive-date=March 31, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220331133347/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=51137&cityname=Boulder%2C+Colorado%2C+United+States+of+America&units=|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Western Regional Climate Center">{{cite web |url=https://wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliNORMNCDC2010.pl?co0848 |title=Boulder, Colorado NCDC 1981–2010 Monthly Normals |website=WRCC |access-date=November 17, 2017 |archive-date=September 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910095246/http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliNORMNCDC2010.pl?co0848 |url-status=live }}</ref> 

Winter conditions range from generally mild to the occasional bitterly cold. Highs average in the mid to upper 40s °F (7–9&nbsp;°C). There are 4.6 nights annually where the temperature drops to {{convert|0|°F|0}}. Because of [[orographic lift]], the mountains to the west often dry out the air passing over the [[Front Range]], shielding the city from precipitation in winter, though heavy snowfalls may occur. Snowfall averages {{convert|88|in|cm}} per season. Snow depth is usually shallow. Due to the high elevation, a strong warming sun can quickly melt snow cover during the day and [[Chinook wind]]s bring rapid warm-ups throughout the winter months.<ref name=NOAA/>

Summers are warm, with frequent afternoon thunderstorms. There are roughly 30 days of {{convert|90|°F|0}} or above each year.<ref name=NOAA/> [[Diurnal temperature variation]] is typically large due to the high elevation and semi-arid climate. Daytime highs are generally cooler than those of most Colorado cities with similar elevations.  

The highest recorded temperature of {{convert|104|°F}} was on June 25, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Weather History: Boulder Airport|url=http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KBDU/2012/6/9/MonthlyCalendar.html?req_city=Boulder&req_state=CO&req_statename=&reqdb.zip=80301&reqdb.magic=1&reqdb.wmo=99999|access-date=June 9, 2015|archive-date=July 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712083953/http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KBDU/2012/6/9/MonthlyCalendar.html?req_city=Boulder&req_state=CO&req_statename=&reqdb.zip=80301&reqdb.magic=1&reqdb.wmo=99999|url-status=live}}</ref> The record low was {{convert|-33|°F|0}} on January 17, 1930.

{{main|Media in Boulder, Colorado}}
Boulder's main daily newspaper, the ''[[Daily Camera]]'', was founded in 1890 as the weekly ''Boulder Camera'', and became a daily newspaper in 1891. The ''[[Colorado Daily]]'' was started in 1892 as a university newspaper for CU Boulder. Following many heated controversies over ''Colorado Daily''{{'s}} political coverage, it severed its ties to the university in 1971. From 1996 to 2000, the ''Boulder Planet'' competed with the ''[[Boulder Weekly]]'' as a free weekly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://localhistory.boulderlibrary.org/islandora/object/islandora%3A57059?solr_nav%5Bid%5D=c166c0c2b04af831920f&solr_nav%5Bpage%5D=0&solr_nav%5Boffset%5D=4|title=Carnegie Library – Boulder Planet, 1996–2000|access-date=September 18, 2018|archive-date=August 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817124955/https://localhistory.boulderlibrary.org/islandora/object/islandora%3A57059?solr_nav%5Bid%5D=c166c0c2b04af831920f&solr_nav%5Bpage%5D=0&solr_nav%5Boffset%5D=4|url-status=live}}</ref> 

Newspaper conglomerate [[The E. W. Scripps Company|Scripps]] acquired the ''Colorado Daily'' in 2005 after its acquisition of the ''Camera'' in 1997, leaving the ''Boulder Weekly'' as the only locally owned newspaper in Boulder. Scripps relinquished its 50 percent ownership in both daily papers in early 2009 to Media News Group. ''Boulder Magazine'', a lifestyle magazine, was founded in 1978.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://brockpub.com/publications/boulder-magazine/|title=Boulder Magazine {{!}} Brock Publishing|language=en-US|access-date=September 18, 2018|date=May 8, 2014|archive-date=September 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918231118/http://brockpub.com/publications/boulder-magazine/|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Boulder Magazine'' is published three times per year.

Boulder is part of the [[Denver]] market for television stations, and it receives many radio stations based in Denver or [[Ft. Collins, Colorado|Ft. Collins]]. For cable television, Boulder is served by [[Comcast Cable]]. The city operates public service Boulder 8 TV on cable (high- and standard-definition), which airs, live-streams and archives council meetings.

[[File:Descending Boulder Denver Turnpike Into Boulder.jpg|thumb|The city from northbound US 36 as the highway descends into Boulder]]
Since Boulder has operated under residential growth control ordinances since 1976, the growth of employment in the city has far outstripped population growth. Considerable road traffic enters the city each morning and leaves each afternoon, since many employees live in [[Longmont, Colorado|Longmont]], [[Lafayette, Colorado|Lafayette]], [[Louisville, Colorado|Louisville]], [[Broomfield, Colorado|Broomfield]], [[Westminster, Colorado|Westminster]], and [[Denver]]. Boulder is served by [[U.S. Route 36 in Colorado|US 36]] and a variety of state highways. Parking regulations in Boulder have been explicitly designed to discourage parking by commuters and to encourage the use of mass transit, with mixed results.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Camera {{!}} |first=Boulder Daily |date=April 1, 2019 |title=Heavy commuting into Boulder drives challenges for city |url=https://www.denverpost.com/2019/04/01/boulder-commuting-climate-change/ |access-date=May 23, 2023 |website=The Denver Post |language=en-US |archive-date=July 25, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230725204428/https://www.denverpost.com/2019/04/01/boulder-commuting-climate-change/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Over the years, Boulder has made significant investments in the multi-modal network. The city is now well known for its grade-separated bicycle and pedestrian paths, which are integrated into a network of bicycle lanes, cycle tracks, and on-street bicycle routes. Boulder provides a community transit network that connects downtown, the University of Colorado campuses, and local shopping amenities. Boulder has no rail transit. Local and regional shuttle busses are funded by a variety of sources. Due in part to these investments in pedestrian, bicycle, and transit infrastructure, Boulder has been recognized both nationally and internationally for its transportation system.<ref>Henao, Alejandro, et al. "Sustainable Transportation Infrastructure Investments And Mode Share Changes: A 20-Year Background Of Boulder, Colorado." Transport Policy 37.(2015): 64–71. Academic Search Complete. Web. February 16, 2016.</ref>

In 2009, the Boulder metropolitan statistical area (MSA) ranked as the fourth highest in the United States for percentage of commuters who biked to work, at 5.4 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/acs-15.pdf|series=American Community Survey Reports|title=Commuting in the United States: 2009|access-date=December 26, 2017|date=September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170726134351/https://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/acs-15.pdf|archive-date=July 26, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2013, the Boulder MSA ranked as the fourth lowest in the United States for percentage of workers who commuted by private automobile, at 71.9 percent. During the same time period, 11.1 percent of Boulder area workers had no commute whatsoever: they worked out of the home.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/acs/acs-32.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813230230/http://census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/acs/acs-32.pdf |archive-date=August 13, 2015 |url-status=live |title= Who Drives to Work?

====Bus service====
Boulder has an extensive bus system operated by the [[Regional Transportation District]] (RTD). The HOP, SKIP, JUMP, Bound, DASH and Stampede routes run throughout the city and connect to nearby communities with departures every ten minutes during peak hours, Monday-Friday. Other routes, such as the 204, 205, 206, 208 and 209 depart every 15 to 30 minutes. Regional routes, traveling between nearby cities such as Longmont (BOLT, J), Golden (GS), and Denver ([[Flatiron Flyer]],<ref>{{cite web

====Railroads====
Freight service is provided by [[Union Pacific]] and [[BNSF]].

Currently there is no intercity passenger service. The last remaining services connecting the Front Range cities ceased with the formation of [[Amtrak]] in 1971.

=====Future transit plans=====
[[Front Range Passenger Rail]] is a current proposal (as of 2023) to link the cities from [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]] in the south, north to [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]] and possibly to [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Heins |first1=Nicole |title=Amtrak hopes to reduce I-25 traffic by creating a passenger rail along the Front Range |url=https://www.kktv.com/2021/04/13/amtrak-hopes-to-reduce-i-25-traffic-by-creating-a-passenger-rail-along-the-front-range/ |access-date=January 1, 2022 |work=KKTV 11 News |date=April 13, 2021 |language=en}}</ref>

A {{Convert|41|mi|adj=on}} RTD [[commuter rail]] route called the Northwest Rail Line, also known as the [[B Line (RTD)|B Line]], is proposed to run from Denver through Boulder to [[Longmont]], with stops in major communities along the way. The Boulder station is to be north of Pearl Street and east of 30th Street. At one time this commuter rail service was scheduled to commence in 2014, but major delays have ensued. In 2016, an initial {{Convert|6|mi|adj=on}} segment opened, reaching from downtown Denver to southern [[Westminster, Colorado|Westminster]] at [[Westminster station (RTD)|Westminster Station]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://kdvr.com/2016/07/24/rtds-b-line-and-westminster-station-officially-opens-on-monday/|title=RTD's B Line and Westminster Station open|last=Engelbart|first=Drew|publisher=FOX31 Denver|date=July 24, 2016|access-date=February 13, 2016|archive-date=July 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726132110/http://kdvr.com/2016/07/24/rtds-b-line-and-westminster-station-officially-opens-on-monday/|url-status=live}}</ref> The remaining {{Convert|35|mi}} of the Northwest Rail Line is planned to be completed by 2044, depending upon funding.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_20968210/rtd-and-other-officials-vow-finish-denvers-northwest|title=RTD and other officials vow to finish Denver's Northwest Rail Line|last=Whaley|first=Monte|newspaper=Denver Post|date=June 29, 2012|access-date=April 25, 2013|archive-date=April 28, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428083841/http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_20968210/rtd-and-other-officials-vow-finish-denvers-northwest|url-status=live}}</ref>

These future transit plans, as well as the current Flatiron Flyer Bus Rapid Transit route, are part of [[FasTracks]], an RTD transit improvement plan funded by a 0.4% increase in the sales tax throughout the Denver metro area. [[Regional Transportation District|RTD]], the developer of FasTracks, is partnering with the city of Boulder to plan a [[transit-oriented development]] near Pearl and 33rd Streets in association with the proposed Boulder commuter rail station. The development is to feature the [[Boulder Railroad Depot]], already relocated to that site, which may be returned to a transit-related use.

====Cycling====
Boulder, well known for its [[bicycle culture]], has hundreds of miles of bicycle-pedestrian paths, lanes, and routes that interconnect to create a renowned network of bikeways usable year-round. Boulder has 74 bike and pedestrian underpasses that facilitate safer and uninterrupted travel throughout much of the city.
