In 1861, Arkansas seceded from the United States and joined the [[Confederate States of America]] during the [[American Civil War]]. On returning to the Union in 1868, Arkansas continued to suffer economically, due to its overreliance on the large-scale [[plantation economy]]. Cotton remained the leading commodity crop, and the cotton market declined. Because farmers and businessmen did not diversify and there was little industrial investment, the state fell behind in economic opportunity. In the late 19th century, the state instituted various [[Jim Crow laws]] to disenfranchise and segregate the African-American population. [[White American|White]] interests dominated Arkansas's politics, with disenfranchisement of African Americans and refusal to reapportion the legislature; only after the federal legislation passed were more African Americans able to vote. During the [[civil rights movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s, Arkansas and particularly Little Rock were major battlegrounds for efforts to integrate schools. Following [[World War II]] in the 1940s, Arkansas began to diversify its economy and see prosperity. During the 1960s, the state became the base of the [[Walmart]] corporation, the [[List of largest companies by revenue|world's largest company by revenue]], headquartered in [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]].

Arkansas is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|29th largest by area]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|34th most populous]] state, with a population of just over three million at the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]].<ref name="Bureau 2021" /> The [[List of capitals in the United States|capital]] and [[List of municipalities in Arkansas|most populous city]] is [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], in the central part of the state, a hub for transportation, business, culture, and government. The northwestern corner of the state, including the [[Fayetteville–Springdale–Rogers Metropolitan Area]] and [[Fort Smith metropolitan area]], is a population, education, and economic center. The largest city in the state's eastern part is [[Jonesboro, Arkansas|Jonesboro]]. The largest city in the state's southeastern part is [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas|Pine Bluff]].

In the 21st century, Arkansas's economy is based on service industries, aircraft, poultry, steel, and tourism, along with important commodity crops of cotton, [[soybeans]] and [[rice]]. The state supports a network of public [[university|universities]] and colleges, including two major university systems: [[Arkansas State University System]] and [[University of Arkansas System]].

The name ''Arkansas'' initially applied to the [[Arkansas River]].

The region was organized as the [[Territory of Arkansaw]] on July 4, 1819, but the territory was admitted to the United States as the state of Arkansas on June 15, 1836. The name was historically pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|k|ən|s|ɔː}}, {{IPAc-en|ɑr|ˈ|k|æ|n|z|ə|s}}, and several other variants.

Before European settlement of North America, Arkansas, was inhabited by indigenous peoples for thousands of years. The [[Caddo]], [[Osage Nation|Osage]], and [[Quapaw]] peoples encountered European explorers. The first of these Europeans was Spanish explorer [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]] in 1541, who crossed the Mississippi and marched across central Arkansas and the Ozark Mountains. After finding nothing he considered of value and encountering native resistance the entire way, he and his men returned to the Mississippi River where de Soto fell ill. From his deathbed he ordered his men to massacre all the men of the nearby village of Anilco, who he feared had been plotting with a powerful polity down the Mississippi River, ''[[Quigualtam]]''. His men obeyed and did not stop with the men, but were said to have massacred women and children as well. He died the following day in what is believed to be the vicinity of modern-day [[McArthur, Arkansas]], in May 1542. His body was weighted down with sand and he was consigned to a watery grave in the Mississippi River under cover of darkness by his men. De Soto had attempted to deceive the native population into thinking he was an immortal deity, sun of the sun, in order to forestall attack by outraged Native Americans on his by then weakened and bedraggled army. In order to keep the ruse up, his men informed the locals that de Soto had ascended into the sky. His will at the time of his death listed "four Indian slaves, three horses and 700 hogs" which were auctioned off. The starving men, who had been living off maize stolen from natives, immediately started butchering the hogs and later, commanded by former [[aide-de-camp]] Moscoso, attempted an overland return to Mexico. They made it as far as Texas before running into territory too dry for maize farming and too thinly populated to sustain themselves by stealing food from the locals. The expedition promptly backtracked to Arkansas. After building a small fleet of boats they then headed down the Mississippi River and eventually on to Mexico by water.<ref name="HUDSONKNIGHTS">{{cite book| author-link =Charles M.

In early antebellum Arkansas, the southeast Arkansas slave-based economy developed rapidly. On the eve of the American Civil War in 1860, enslaved African Americans numbered 111,115 people, just over 25% of the state's population.<ref>[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1860 US Census, University of Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823030234/http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php |date=August 23, 2007 }}.

Many politicians were elected to office from [[The Family (Arkansas politics)|the Family]], the Southern rights political force in antebellum Arkansas. Residents generally wanted to avoid a civil war. When the Gulf states seceded in early 1861, delegates to a convention called to determine whether Arkansas should secede referred the question back to the voters for a referendum to be held in August.<ref name="bol" /> Arkansas did not secede until [[Abraham Lincoln]] demanded Arkansas troops be sent to [[Fort Sumter]] to quell [[Battle of Fort Sumter|the rebellion there]]. On May 6, the members of the state convention, having been recalled by the convention president, voted to terminate Arkansas's membership in the Union and join the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref name="bol" />

Arkansas held a very important position for the Rebels, maintaining control of the [[Mississippi River]] and surrounding Southern states. The bloody [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]] just across the border in Missouri shocked many Arkansans who thought the war would be a quick and decisive Southern victory. Battles early in the war took place in northwest Arkansas, including the [[Battle of Cane Hill]], [[Battle of Pea Ridge]], and [[Battle of Prairie Grove]]. Union general [[Samuel Ryan Curtis|Samuel Curtis]] swept across the state to [[Helena-West Helena, Arkansas|Helena]] in the Delta in 1862. Little Rock was captured the following year. The government shifted the state Confederate capital to [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]], and then again to [[Washington, Arkansas|Washington]] from 1863 to 1865, for the remainder of the war. Throughout the state, [[guerrilla]] warfare ravaged the countryside and destroyed cities.<ref>Arnold et al. 2002, p. 200.</ref> Passion for the Confederate cause waned after implementation of programs such as the draft, high taxes, and martial law.

Under the [[Reconstruction era#Military Reconstruction|Military Reconstruction Act]], Congress declared Arkansas restored to the Union in June 1868, after the Legislature accepted the 14th Amendment. The Republican-controlled reconstruction legislature established universal male suffrage (though temporarily disfranchising former Confederate Army officers, who were all Democrats), a public education system for blacks and whites, and passed general issues to improve the state and help more of the population. The State soon came under control of the [[Radical Republicans]] and Unionists, and led by Governor [[Powell Clayton]], they presided over a time of great upheaval as Confederate sympathizers and the [[Ku Klux Klan]] fought the new developments, particularly voting rights for African Americans.

===End of Reconstruction and late 19th century===
In 1874, the [[Brooks-Baxter War]], a political struggle between factions of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] shook Little Rock and the state governorship. It was settled only when President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] ordered [[Joseph Brooks (politician)|Joseph Brooks]] to disperse his militant supporters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2276 |title=Brooks-Baxter War—Encyclopedia of Arkansas |access-date=August 24, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091926/http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2276 |archive-date=September 29, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Following the Brooks-Baxter War, a new state constitution was ratified, re-enfranchising former Confederates and effectively bringing an end to Reconstruction.

In 1881, the Arkansas state legislature enacted a bill that adopted an official pronunciation of the state's name, to combat a controversy then simmering. (See Law and Government below.)

After Reconstruction, the state began to receive more [[immigrants]] and [[migrant worker|migrants]]. Chinese, [[Italians|Italian]], and [[Syrian]] men were recruited for farm labor in the developing Delta region. None of these nationalities stayed long at farm labor; the Chinese especially, as they quickly became small merchants in towns around the Delta. Many Chinese became such successful merchants in small towns that they were able to educate their children at college.<ref>William D. Baker, ''[http://www.arkansaspreservation.org/pdf/publications/Minority_Settlement.pdf Minority Settlement in the Mississippi River Counties of the Arkansas Delta, 1870–1930] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527190216/http://www.arkansaspreservation.org/pdf/publications/Minority_Settlement.pdf |date=May 27, 2008 }}'', Arkansas Preservation Commission.

Construction of railroads enabled more farmers to get their products to market. It also brought new development into different parts of the state, including the Ozarks, where some areas were developed as resorts. In a few years at the end of the 19th century, for instance, [[Eureka Springs]] in [[Carroll County, Arkansas|Carroll County]] grew to 10,000 people, rapidly becoming a tourist destination and the fourth-largest city of the state. It featured newly constructed, elegant resort hotels and spas planned around its natural springs, considered to have healthful properties. The town's attractions included horse racing and other entertainment. It appealed to a wide variety of classes, becoming almost as popular as [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]].

In the late 1880s, the worsening agricultural depression catalyzed Populist and third party movements, leading to interracial coalitions. Struggling to stay in power, in the 1890s the Democrats in Arkansas followed other Southern states in passing legislation and constitutional amendments that [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] blacks and poor whites. In 1891 state legislators passed a requirement for a [[literacy test]], knowing it would exclude many blacks and whites. At the time, more than 25% of the population could neither read nor write. In 1892, they amended the state constitution to require a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] and more complex residency requirements, both of which adversely affected poor people and sharecroppers, forcing most blacks and many poor whites from voter rolls.

By 1900 the Democratic Party expanded use of the [[white primary]] in county and state elections, further denying blacks a part in the political process. Only in the primary was there any competition among candidates, as Democrats held all the power. The state was a Democratic one-party state for decades, until after passage of the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] to enforce constitutional rights.<ref>[http://www.oldstatehouse.com/educational_programs/classroom/arkansas_news/detail.asp?id=800&issue_id=36&page=3 "White Primary" System Bars Blacks from Politics—1900, ''The Arkansas News'', Old State House, Spring 1987, p.3.

Between 1905 and 1911, Arkansas began to receive a small immigration of [[Germans|German]], [[Slovaks|Slovak]], and Scots-Irish from Europe. The German and Slovak peoples settled in the eastern part of the state known as the [[Prairie]], and the Irish founded small communities in the southeast part of the state. The Germans were mostly Lutheran and the Slovaks were primarily Catholic. The Irish were mostly Protestant from [[Ulster]], of Scots and Northern Borders descent. Some early 20th-century immigration included people from eastern Europe. Together, these immigrants made the Delta more diverse than the rest of the state. In the same years, some black migrants moved into the area because of opportunities to develop the bottomlands and own their own property.

Black sharecroppers began to try to organize a farmers' union after World War{{spaces}}I. They were seeking better conditions of payment and accounting from white landowners of the area cotton plantations. Whites resisted any change and often tried to break up their meetings. On September 30, 1919, two white men, including a local deputy, tried to break up a meeting of black sharecroppers who were trying to organize a farmers' union. After a white deputy was killed in a confrontation with guards at the meeting, word spread to town and around the area.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} Hundreds of whites from Phillips and neighboring areas rushed to suppress the blacks, and started attacking blacks at large. [[governor of Arkansas|Governor]] [[Charles Hillman Brough]] requested federal troops to stop what was called the [[Elaine massacre]]. White mobs spread throughout the county, killing an estimated 237 blacks before most of the violence was suppressed after October 1.<ref name="encyclopediaofarkansas.net">[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=1102 Elaine Massacre, Arkansas Encyclopedia of History and Culture]; accessed April 3, 2008.</ref> Five whites also died in the incident. The governor accompanied the troops to the scene; President [[Woodrow Wilson]] had approved their use.

The [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]] flooded the areas along the Ouachita Rivers along with many other rivers.

Based on the order of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] given shortly after [[Imperial Japan]]'s [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], nearly 16,000 [[Japanese Americans]] were forcibly removed from the [[West Coast of the United States]] and incarcerated in two internment camps in the [[Arkansas Delta]].<ref name="encyclopedia">{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2273|title=Japanese American Relocation Camps—Encyclopedia of Arkansas|website=encyclopediaofarkansas.net}}</ref> The [[Rohwer War Relocation Center|Rohwer Camp]] in [[Desha County]] operated from September 1942 to November 1945 and at its peak interned 8,475 prisoners.<ref name="encyclopedia" /> The [[Jerome War Relocation Center]] in [[Drew County]] operated from October 1942 to June 1944 and held about 8,000.<ref name="encyclopedia" />

===Fall of segregation===
After the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled segregation in public schools unconstitutional in [[Brown v. Board of Education|''Brown ''v.'' Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas'']] (1954), some students worked to integrate schools in the state. The [[Little Rock Nine]] brought Arkansas to national attention in 1957 when the federal government had to intervene to protect African-American students trying to integrate a high school in the capital. Governor [[Orval Faubus]] had ordered the [[Arkansas National Guard]] to help segregationists prevent nine African-American students from enrolling at Little Rock's Central High School. After attempting three times to contact Faubus, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] sent 1,000 troops from the active-duty 101st Airborne Division to escort and protect the African-American students as they entered school on September 25, 1957. In defiance of federal court orders to integrate, the governor and city of Little Rock decided to close the high schools for the remainder of the school year. By the fall of 1959, the Little Rock high schools were completely integrated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?search=1&entryID=723 |title=Little Rock Nine—Encyclopedia of Arkansas |access-date=August 24, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929115012/http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?search=1&entryID=723 |archive-date=September 29, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Arkansas can generally be split into two halves, the highlands in the northwest and the lowlands of the southeast.<ref>Smith 1989, p. 15.</ref> The highlands are part of the Southern Interior Highlands, including [[The Ozarks]] and the [[Ouachita Mountains]]. The southern lowlands include the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] and the [[Arkansas Delta]].<ref>Smith 1989, pp. 15–17.</ref> This split can yield to a regional division into northwest, southwest, northeast, southeast, and central Arkansas. These regions are broad and not defined along county lines. Arkansas has seven distinct natural regions: the Ozark Mountains, Ouachita Mountains, [[Arkansas River Valley]], Gulf Coastal Plain, [[Crowley's Ridge]], and the Arkansas Delta, with [[Central Arkansas]] sometimes included as a blend of multiple regions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arkansas Regions |url=http://www.arkansasheritage.com/discover/natural_environments/regions.aspx |website=Discover Arkansas History |publisher=The Department of Arkansas Heritage |access-date=June 28, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614023536/http://www.arkansasheritage.com/discover/natural_environments/regions.aspx |archive-date=June 14, 2012 }}</ref>

The southeastern part of Arkansas along the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]] is sometimes called the Arkansas Delta. This region is a flat landscape of [[River delta|rich alluvial soils formed by repeated flooding]] of the adjacent Mississippi. Farther from the river, in the southeastern part of the state, the Grand Prairie has a more undulating landscape. Both are fertile agricultural areas. The Delta region is bisected by a geological formation known as [[Crowley's Ridge]].

Arkansas is known for extreme weather and frequent storms. A typical year brings thunderstorms, tornadoes, and hail. Occasional cold snaps stand to bring varying amounts of snow, as well as ice storms. Between both the [[Great Plains]] and the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf States]], Arkansas, receives around 60 days of thunderstorms. Arkansas is located in [[Dixie alley]], and very near [[tornado alley]]. As a result, a few of the most destructive tornadoes in U.S. history have struck the state.

The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimated that the population of Arkansas was 3,017,804 on July 1, 2019, a 3.49% increase since the [[2010 United States census]].<ref name="AnnualEstUS">{{cite web |url=https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/tables/2010-2019/state/totals/nst-est2019-01.xlsx?# |title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for the United States, Regions, States, and Puerto Rico: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2019 |website=2010-2019 Population Estimates |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division |date=December 30, 2019 |access-date=January 27, 2020}}</ref> At the [[2020 United States census|2020 U.S. census]], Arkansas had a resident population of 3,011,524.

From fewer than 15,000 in 1820, Arkansas's population grew to 52,240 during a special census in 1835, far exceeding the 40,000 required to apply for statehood.<ref>Arnold et al. 2002, p. 106.</ref> Following statehood in 1836, the population doubled each decade until the [[1870 United States Census|1870 census]] conducted following the American Civil War. The state recorded growth in each successive decade, although it gradually slowed in the 20th century.

It recorded population losses in the [[1950 United States census|1950]] and [[1960 United States census|1960 censuses]].

European Americans have a strong presence in the northwestern [[Ozarks]] and the central part of the state. African Americans live mainly in the southern and eastern parts of the state. Arkansans of Irish, English and German ancestry are mostly found in the far northwestern Ozarks near the Missouri border. Ancestors of the Irish in the Ozarks were chiefly [[Ulster Scots people|Scots-Irish]], Protestants from [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Scotland|Scottish]] lowlands and northern England part of the largest group of immigrants from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] before the American Revolution. [[English American|English]] and [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] immigrants settled throughout the back country of the South and in the more mountainous areas. Americans of [[English American|English]] stock are found throughout the state.<ref>[[David Hackett Fischer]], ''[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp.633–639</ref>

A 2010 survey of the principal ancestries of Arkansas's residents revealed the following:<ref>{{cite web |author= American FactFinder, United States Census Bureau |url= http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_CP02&prodType=table |archive-url= https://archive.today/20200212213806/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_CP02&prodType=table |url-status= dead |archive-date= February 12, 2020 |title= Arkansas—Selected Social Characteristics in the United States |year= 2010 |publisher= [[American Community Survey]] |access-date= July 4, 2012 }}</ref> 15.5% [[African American]], 12.3% [[Irish American|Irish]], 11.5% [[German Americans|German]], 11.0% [[American ethnicity|American]], 10.1% [[English American|English]], 4.7% [[Mexican American|Mexican]], 2.1% [[French American|French]], 1.7% [[Scottish American|Scottish]], 1.7% [[Dutch American|Dutch]], 1.6% [[Italian American|Italian]], and 1.4% [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]].

Most people identifying as "American" are of English descent or Scots-Irish descent. Their families have been in the state so long, in many cases since before statehood, that they choose to identify simply as having American ancestry or do not in fact know their ancestry. Their ancestry primarily goes back to the original 13 colonies and for this reason many of them today simply claim American ancestry. Many people who identify as of Irish descent are in fact of Scots-Irish descent.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=SVoAXh-dNuYC&dq=Sharing+the+dream:+white+males+in+multicultural+America++english+ancestry&pg=PA57 Sharing the Dream: White Males in a Multicultural America] By Dominic J.

According to the 2006–2008 American Community Survey, 93.8% of Arkansas's population (over the age of five) spoke only English at home. About 4.5% of the state's population spoke Spanish at home. About 0.7% of the state's population spoke another [[Indo-European language]].

Like most other Southern states, Arkansas is part of the [[Bible Belt]] and predominantly [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. The largest denominations by number of adherents in 2010 were the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] with 661,382; the [[United Methodist Church]] with 158,574; non-denominational Evangelical Protestants with 129,638; the [[Catholic Church]] with 122,662; and [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] with 31,254.

In 2014, the [[Pew Research Center]] determined that 79% of the population was Christian, dominated by evangelicals in the Southern Baptist and independent Baptist churches. In contrast with many other states, the Catholic Church as of 2014 was not the largest Christian denomination in Arkansas.

{{Main|Politics and government of Arkansas}}
As with the federal government of the United States, political power in Arkansas is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. Each officer's term is four years long. Office holders are [[term-limited]] to two full terms plus any partial terms before the first full term.<ref>{{cite web |last1= English |first1= Art |last2= Weberg |first2= Brian |title= Term Limits in the Arkansas General Assembly: A Citizen Legislature Responds |year= 2005 |publisher= National Conference of State Legislatures |website= Joint Project on Term Limits |page= 1 |url= http://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/documents/jptl/casestudies/Arkansasv2.pdf |access-date= February 3, 2013 |archive-date= June 3, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130603142221/http://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/documents/jptl/casestudies/Arkansasv2.pdf |url-status= dead }}</ref>

In Arkansas, the lieutenant governor is elected separately from the governor and thus can be from a different political party.<ref>{{cite web |title= Office of Lieutenant Governor |url= http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=5722 |date= February 28, 2011 |publisher= The Pryor Center |website= Encyclopedia of Arkansas |access-date= January 6, 2013 }}</ref>

===Legislative===
{{Main|Arkansas General Assembly}}
The [[Arkansas General Assembly]] is the state's [[bicameral]] bodies of legislators, composed of the [[Arkansas Senate|Senate]] and [[Arkansas House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The Senate contains 35 members from districts of approximately equal population. These districts are redrawn decennially with each US census, and in election years ending in "2", the entire body is put up for reelection. Following the election, half of the seats are designated as two-year seats and are up for reelection again in two years, these "half-terms" do not count against a legislator's term limits. The remaining half serve a full four-year term. This staggers elections such that half the body is up for reelection every two years and allows for complete body turnover following redistricting.<ref>{{cite web |last= Greenberg |first= Dan |url= http://arkansaseconomics.org/policy/050105.html |title= The Dangers of Diluting Term Limits |publisher= Arkansas Policy Center |access-date= February 3, 2012 }}</ref> Arkansas voters elected a 21–14 Republican majority in the Senate in 2012. Arkansas House members can serve a maximum of three two-year terms. House districts are redistricted by the Arkansas Board of Apportionment. In the 2012 elections, Republicans gained a 51–49 majority in the House of Representatives.<ref>{{cite web |title= Republicans Take Control of Arkansas House, Senate |url= http://5newsonline.com/2012/11/13/republicans-take-control-of-arkansas-house-senate/ |first= Mallory |last= Cooke |date= November 14, 2012 |publisher= [[KFSM-TV]] |access-date= January 8, 2013 }}</ref>

Following the term limits changes, studies have shown that lobbyists have become less influential in state politics. Legislative staff, not subject to term limits, have acquired additional power and influence due to the high rate of elected official turnover.<ref>{{cite web |last1= English |first1= Art |last2= Weberg |first2= Brian |title= Term Limits in the Arkansas General Assembly: A Citizen Legislature Responds |year= 2005 |publisher= National Conference of State Legislatures |website= Joint Project on Term Limits |url= http://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/documents/jptl/casestudies/Arkansasv2.pdf |pages= 33–34 |access-date= February 3, 2013 |archive-date= June 3, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130603142221/http://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/documents/jptl/casestudies/Arkansasv2.pdf |url-status= dead }}</ref>

===Judicial===
{{Main|Courts of Arkansas}}
Arkansas's judicial branch has five court systems: [[Arkansas Supreme Court]], [[Arkansas Court of Appeals]], Circuit Courts, District Courts and City Courts.

Most cases begin in district court, which is subdivided into state district court and local district court. State district courts exercise district-wide jurisdiction over the districts created by the General Assembly, and local district courts are presided over by part-time judges who may privately practice law. 25 state district court judges preside over 15 districts, with more districts created in 2013 and 2017. There are 28 judicial circuits of Circuit Court, with each contains five subdivisions: criminal, civil, probate, domestic relations, and juvenile court. The jurisdiction of the Arkansas Court of Appeals is determined by the Arkansas Supreme Court, and there is no [[appeal|right of appeal]] from the Court of Appeals to the high court. The Arkansas Supreme Court can review Court of Appeals cases upon application by either a party to the litigation, upon request by the Court of Appeals, or if the Arkansas Supreme Court feels the case should have been initially assigned to it. The twelve judges of the Arkansas Court of Appeals are elected from judicial districts to renewable six-year terms.

The Arkansas Supreme Court is the court of last resort in the state, composed of seven justices elected to eight-year terms. Established by the Arkansas Constitution in 1836, the court's decisions can be appealed to only the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].

Arkansas governor [[Bill Clinton]] brought national attention to the state with a long speech at the [[1988 Democratic National Convention]] endorsing [[Michael Dukakis]]. Some journalists suggested the speech was a threat to his ambitions; Clinton defined it "a comedy of error, just one of those fluky things".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/07/30/when_bill_clinton_died_on_stage/|title=When Bill Clinton died onstage|last=Kornacki|first=Steve|website=Salon|date=July 30, 2012 |access-date=November 10, 2016}}</ref> He won the Democratic nomination for president in 1992. Presenting himself as a "New Democrat" and using incumbent [[George H. W. Bush]]'s [[Read my lips: no new taxes|broken promise]] against him, Clinton won the [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]] with 43.0% of the vote to Bush's 37.5% and independent billionaire [[Ross Perot]]'s 18.9%.

Most Republican strength traditionally lay mainly in the northwestern part of the state, particularly [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]] and [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]], as well as North Central Arkansas around the [[Mountain Home, Arkansas|Mountain Home]] area. In the latter area, Republicans have been known to get 90% or more of the vote, while the rest of the state was more Democratic. After 2010, Republican strength expanded further to the Northeast and Southwest and into the Little Rock suburbs. The Democrats are mostly concentrated to central Little Rock, the Mississippi Delta, the Pine Bluff area, and the areas around the southern border with Louisiana.

Arkansas has elected only three Republicans to the U.S. Senate since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]: [[Tim Hutchinson]], who was defeated after one term by [[Mark Pryor]]; [[John Boozman]], who defeated incumbent [[Blanche Lincoln]]; and [[Tom Cotton]], who defeated Pryor in 2014. Before 2013, the General Assembly had not been controlled by the Republican Party since Reconstruction, with the GOP holding a 51-seat majority in the state House and a 21-seat (of 35) in the state Senate following victories in 2012. Arkansas was one of just three states among the states of the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] that sent two Democrats to the U.S. Senate (the others being Florida and [[Virginia]]) for any period during the first decade of the 21st century.

In 2010, Republicans captured three of the state's four seats in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. In 2012, they won election to all four House seats. Arkansas held the distinction of having a U.S. House delegation composed entirely of military veterans ([[Rick Crawford (politician)|Rick Crawford]], [[United States Army|Army]]; [[Tim Griffin]], [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]]; [[Steve Womack]], Army [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]]; [[Tom Cotton]], Army). When Pryor was defeated in 2014, the entire congressional delegation was in GOP hands for the first time since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].

Reflecting the state's large evangelical population, Arkansas has a strong [[Social conservatism|social conservative]] bent. In the aftermath of the landmark Supreme Court decision ''[[Dobbs v.

[[File:Van Buren Confederate Monument 001.jpg|thumb|188x188px|[[Van Buren Confederate Monument]] at the [[Crawford County, Arkansas|Crawford County]] Courthouse in [[Van Buren, Arkansas]]]]
The culture of Arkansas includes distinct cuisine, dialect, and traditional festivals. Sports are also very important to the culture, including football, baseball, basketball, hunting, and fishing. Perhaps the best-known aspect of Arkansas's culture is the stereotype that its citizens are shiftless hillbillies.<ref>Arnold et al. 2002, p. 115.</ref> The reputation began when early explorers characterized the state as a savage wilderness full of outlaws and thieves.<ref>Blevins 2009, p. 15.</ref> The most enduring icon of Arkansas's hillbilly reputation is ''[[Edward Washburn|The Arkansas Traveller]]'', a painted depiction of a folk tale from the 1840s.<ref>Blevins 2009, p. 30.</ref> Though intended to represent the divide between rich southeastern plantation Arkansas planters and the poor northwestern hill country, the meaning was twisted to represent a Northerner lost in the Ozarks on a white horse asking a backwoods Arkansan for directions.<ref>Sutherlin 1996, p. 20.</ref> The state also suffers from the racial stigma common to former Confederate states, with historical events such as the [[Little Rock Nine]] adding to Arkansas's enduring image.<ref>Sutherlin 1996, p. 17.</ref>

Art and history museums display pieces of cultural value for Arkansans and tourists to enjoy. [[Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art]] in [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]] was visited by 604,000 people in 2012, its first year.<ref>{{cite web |title=600K visitors later, Crystal Bridges turns 1 |last=Bartels |first=Chuck |url=http://www.newsok.com/article/feed/461683 |date=November 12, 2012 |access-date=June 18, 2017 |publisher=News Ok }}{{Dead link|date=July 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The museum includes walking trails and educational opportunities in addition to displaying over 450 works covering five centuries of American art.<ref>{{cite news |title= Crystal Bridges art museum is reshaping Wal-Mart's hometown |last= Reynolds |first= Chris |newspaper= Chicago Tribune |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/travel/la-tr-arkansas-20121014,0,3925043.story?page=2 |date= October 14, 2012 |access-date= November 18, 2012 }}</ref> Several historic town sites have been restored as Arkansas [[List of Arkansas state parks|state parks]], including [[Historic Washington State Park]], [[Powhatan Historic State Park]], and [[Davidsonville Historic State Park]].

Arkansas features a variety of native music across the state, ranging from the [[blues]] heritage of [[West Memphis, Arkansas|West Memphis]], [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas|Pine Bluff]], [[Helena–West Helena, Arkansas|Helena–West Helena]] to [[rockabilly]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and folk music from the Ozarks. Festivals such as the [[King Biscuit Blues Festival]] and [[Bikes, Blues, and BBQ]] pay homage to the history of blues in the state. The Ozark Folk Festival in [[Mountain View, Arkansas|Mountain View]] is a celebration of Ozark culture and often features folk and bluegrass musicians. Literature set in Arkansas such as ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]'' by [[Maya Angelou]] and ''[[A Painted House]]'' by [[John Grisham]] describe the culture at various time periods.

===Sports and recreation===

Sports have become an integral part of the culture of Arkansas, and her residents enjoy participating in, betting on, and spectating various events throughout the year.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Molter |first=Michael |date=2024-09-24 |title=Arkansas Sportsbooks Clear $1 Billion Sports Betting Handle |url=https://www.legalsportsbetting.com/news/arkansas-sportsbooks-clear-1-billion-sports-betting-handle-09-24-2024/ |access-date=2024-09-24 |website=www.legalsportsbetting.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

Team sports and especially collegiate football are important to Arkansans. College football in Arkansas began from humble beginnings, when the [[University of Arkansas]] first fielded a team in [[1894 Arkansas Cardinals football team|1894]]. Over the years, many Arkansans have looked to [[Arkansas Razorbacks football]] as the public image of the state.<ref>{{ cite web |title= Retirement of an Arkansas Newsmaker |first=John |last=Brummett |date= January 13, 2008 |publisher= Arkansas News Bureau |work=Pine Bluff Commercial |location= Pine Bluff, Arkansas |url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/document-view?p=NewsBank&docref=news/11E2C4D6FB3F6F48 |access-date= January 16, 2021 |via=Newsbank }}</ref> Although the University of Arkansas is based in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]], the Razorbacks have always played at least one game per season at [[War Memorial Stadium (Arkansas)|War Memorial Stadium]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] in an effort to keep fan support in central and south Arkansas.

[[Arkansas State University]] became the second [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) (then known as Division I-A) team in the state in 1992 after playing in lower divisions for nearly two decades. The two schools have never played each other, due to the University of Arkansas's policy of not playing intrastate games.<ref>{{cite news |title= Arkansas matchup is not likely soon |publisher= [[Sun Herald]] |date= July 20, 2003 |page= 9B }}</ref> Two other campuses of the [[University of Arkansas System]] are Division I members. The [[University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff]] is a member of the [[Southwestern Athletic Conference]], a league whose members all play football in the second-level [[Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS). The [[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]], known for sports purposes as Little Rock, joined the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] in 2022 after playing in the [[Sun Belt Conference]]; unlike many other OVC members, it does not field [[List of NCAA Division I non-football programs|a football program]]. The state's other Division{{spaces}}I member is the [[University of Central Arkansas]] (UCA), which joined the [[ASUN Conference]] in 2021 after leaving the FCS [[Southland Conference]]. Because the ASUN does not plan to start FCS football competition until at least 2022, UCA football is competing in the [[Western Athletic Conference]] as part of a formal football partnership between the two leagues. Seven of Arkansas's smaller colleges play in [[NCAA Division&nbsp;II]], with six in the [[Great American Conference]] and one in the [[Lone Star Conference]]. Two other small Arkansas colleges compete in [[NCAA Division&nbsp;III]], in which [[athletic scholarship]]s are prohibited. High school football also began to grow in Arkansas in the early 20th century.

Baseball runs deep in Arkansas and was popular before the state hosted [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[spring training]] in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]] from 1886 to the 1920s. Two [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] teams are based in the state. The [[Arkansas Travelers]] play at [[Dickey–Stephens Park]] in [[North Little Rock, Arkansas|North Little Rock]], and the [[Northwest Arkansas Naturals]] play in [[Arvest Ballpark]] in [[Springdale, Arkansas|Springdale]]. Both teams compete in [[Double-A Central]].

Hunting continues in the state. The state created the [[Arkansas Game and Fish Commission]] in 1915 to regulate hunting.<ref>{{cite web |last= Griffee |first= Carol |title= Odyssey of Survival, A History of the Arkansas Conservation Sales Tax |page= 10 |url= http://www.teaming.com/sites/default/files/REPORT%20Odyssey%20of%20Survival-%20A%20History%20of%20the%20AR%20Conservation%20Sales%20Tax.pdf |access-date= September 16, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130117082707/http://www.teaming.com/sites/default/files/REPORT%20Odyssey%20of%20Survival-%20A%20History%20of%20the%20AR%20Conservation%20Sales%20Tax.pdf |archive-date= January 17, 2013 |url-status= dead }}</ref> Today a significant portion of Arkansas's population participates in hunting [[duck]] in the [[Mississippi flyway]] and [[deer]] across the state.<ref name="Sutherlin 1996, p. 164">Sutherlin 1996, p. 164.</ref> [[Ducks Unlimited]] has called [[Stuttgart, Arkansas]], "the epicenter of the duck universe".<ref>{{ cite journal |last=Bourne |first=Hampton |title= Calling Accents |url=https://www.ducks.org/hunting/duck-calling/calling-accents |date=September–October 2022 |page= 76 |journal= [[Ducks Unlimited]] |location= Memphis, Tennessee |oclc=1774718 |issn=0012-6950 |access-date= September 12, 2022 }}</ref> Millions of acres of public land are available for both bow and modern gun hunters.<ref name="Sutherlin 1996, p. 164"/>

Fishing has always been popular in Arkansas,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hanggi |first=Sam |date=2024-03-15 |title=What I Learned Fishing in Arkansas |url=https://www.wired2fish.com/fishing-tips/what-i-learned-fishing-in-arkansas |access-date=2024-08-31 |website=Wired2Fish |language=en-US}}</ref> and the sport and the state have benefited from the creation of reservoirs across the state. Following the completion of [[Norfork Dam]], the [[Norfork Tailwater]] and the [[White River (Arkansas)|White River]] have become a destination for [[trout]] fishers. Several smaller retirement communities such as [[Bull Shoals, Arkansas|Bull Shoals]], [[Hot Springs Village, Arkansas|Hot Springs Village]], and [[Fairfield Bay, Arkansas|Fairfield Bay]] have flourished due to their position on a fishing lake. The [[National Park Service]] has preserved the [[Buffalo National River]] in its natural state and fly fishers visit it annually.
