==Etymology and legend==

The origin of Palwal is related to the local legend related to the [[Mahabharata]], according to which the town is named after an [[asura]] called ''"Palwasura"'' who was slain by [[Balarama]], the brother of [[Krishna]]. To commemorate this event an annual festival called ''"Baldev Chhat Ka Mela"'' is held here, and a ''"Dauji temple"'' in honor of Balrama is situated in Banchari village 25&nbsp;km from Palwal on [[Grand Trunk Road]].<ref>[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/travel/destinations/haryanas-palwal-town-is-closely-linked-to-a-demon-the-pandavas-and-gandhi/as71245433.cms Haryana’s Palwal town is closely linked to a demon, the Pandavas and Gandhi], India Times, 23 Sept 2019.</ref>

==History==
The local tradition identifies Palwal with the Apelava town mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]], which was later restored by [[Vikramaditya]].<ref>[https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V19_381.gif Palwal Town] [[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]], 1909, v. 19, p. 375.hh</ref>

'''Matia Fort''' or ''Palwal Fort'' was built during [[Sher Shah Suri]]'s reign. Excavations have unearthed evidence of a grand palace at the bottom of the fort. As of 2021, it lies in ruins.<ref name=ta2>Sohan Singh Khattar and Reena Kar, 2021, [https://books.google.com/books?id=M60zEAAAQBAJ&dq=history+of+loharu+fort&pg=PA308 Know Your State Haryana], Arihant Publications, pp 308.</ref>

A historical building by the name 'Gandhi Seva Ashram' and a Museum was made in the memory of Mahatma Gandhi. The Gandhi Museum is close to Palwal Railway Station. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] was arrested on 10 April 1919 at Palwal railway station while going to [[Punjab]] against the [[Rowlatt Act]]. Keeping this memory alive lasting on October 2, 1938, Netaji [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] had kept it. Gandhi exhibition was established in Gandhi Seva Ashram in the year 1962. In it, history related to Gandhiji was preserved. Pictures for the exhibition were brought from the [[National Gandhi Museum]] of [[Delhi]]. Later, they started getting damaged, they were upgraded and the exhibition site was changed to the museum.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gandhi Museum {{!}} District Palwal |url=https://palwal.gov.in/tourist-place/gandhi-museum/ |website=palwal.gov.in |publisher=GOVERNMENT OF HARYANA |access-date=17 September 2018 }}</ref>
