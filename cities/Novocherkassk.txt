==History==
===Imperial era===
====Foundation====
Although the first settlement in the region was founded by [[Temryuk of Kabardia|Temroqwa Idar]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bronevsky |first=S.N. |title=''Historical summary on Russia's relations with Persia, Georgia and with the mountain peoples of the Caucasus'' |url=http://www.vostlit.info/Texts/rus9/Bronevskij/frametext1.htm |access-date=2021-09-09 |website=Vostlit}}</ref><ref name=":1">Khasht, Ali. ''Circassian Prince Temroqwa Idar.''</ref> the city of Novocherkassk was founded in 1805 by Lieutenant-general [[Matvei Platov]], the [[Ataman]] of the [[Don Cossacks]], as the [[administrative center]] of the [[Don Host Oblast]]. It was established in reaction to the original administrative center, the ''[[stanitsa]]'' of [[Starocherkasskaya|Cherkassk]], being deemed unsuitable as the capital for the Don Cossacks for several reasons. Cherkassk was repeatedly flooded for long periods of time due to its low-lying location on the banks of the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]], and attempts at constructing [[levees]] to protect the town were found to be too costly and ineffective.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}}  Additionally, Cherkassk was prone to destructive fires due to its chaotic layout and wooden buildings, and was located far away from any major roads. Despite the fact that ten of the eleven representatives of the villages that were part of Cherkassk refused to move the capital, Platov still made a presentation to [[Tsar Alexander I]] asking him to allow the capital of the Don Cossacks to be moved to another location, and was granted permission in a [[decree]] from the Tsar on August 23, 1804.

====Plan as new capital of the Don Cossacks====
Platov and the engineer [[François Sainte de Wollant]] developed Novocherkassk as a [[planned city]], deciding to build it on a location at the top of a hill known as the "[[Wolf]]'s Lair" to the north of Cherkassk, near the [[confluence]] of the Tuzlov River and Aksay River. On November 7, 1804, De Wollant and Platov presented to Tsar Alexander a plan for the future of the city and an extensive report, in which the clearly embellished merits of the area chosen for construction were described. The city was designed in the popular traditions of European models of urban development, with spacious areas, wide [[avenue (landscape)|avenues]] and [[boulevard]]s full of greenery. De Wollant, calling the future Novocherkassk "little [[Paris]]" on the basis of numerous [[town squares]], each of which was supposed to feature a [[Church (building)|church]], and to have streets beginning radially around each square. On December 31, 1804, after reviewing the plan and the report of Platov and De Wollant, Tsar Alexander personally inscribed: "To be according to this. Alexander". The construction of the city was slow, primarily because of the reluctance of most Don Cossacks to leave their homes in Cherkassk, and the new capital being {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=off}} from the River Don, with which the Cossacks were closely connected throughout its history. To compensate, there were even plans to deepen the Aksay River (a [[distributary]] of the Don) where the new city was located to eventually alter the course of the Don through the city. This plan was abandoned due to lack of funds, and for more than three decades the question of the place of the capital of the Don Cossack remained unresolved, while growth of Novocherkassk stagnated.

By 1837, an alternative to transfer the capital to the village of Aksayskoy, which was also on a hill and near the Don, gained popularity. However, [[Tsar Nicholas I]] personally inspected Novocherkassk and the village of Aksayskoy that same year, and after returning to [[Saint Petersburg]] ordered the Don Cossacks to keep the capital in Cherkassk because of the difficulties and uselessness of the transfer. In the first half of the 19th century, Novocherkassk was built only as an army center, administrative buildings, guest yards, [[taverns]], [[wine cellars]], hotels, and [[General (rank)|generals]] and [[noblemen]]'s houses. In the 1850s, [[industrialization]] reached Novocherkassk and industrial enterprises were formed, however only one-thousand of the city's twenty-thousand residents worked in them.

===Soviet era===
On the eve of the [[February Revolution]], Novocherkassk had a population of about sixty thousand people, about twenty-five thousand of whom were serving Cossacks and their families, three thousand were [[noblemen]], and about five hundred were [[clergymen]]. Novocherkassk, unlike many Russian cities at the time, had almost no permanent [[merchants]] or [[peasants]]. During the [[Russian Civil War]] from 1917 to 1922, Novocherkassk was the center of the [[Don Army]] [[counter-revolution]] and came under the command of General [[Alexey Kaledin]]. The [[Red Army]] eventually defeated ousted the [[White movement|White]]-aligned Don Army from Novocherkassk on January&nbsp;7, 1920.

During [[World War II]], the [[Wehrmacht]] of [[Nazi Germany]] occupied Novocherkassk between July&nbsp;24, 1942 and February&nbsp;13, 1943. The city was chosen as the headquarters of the Don Army Group, headed by Erich v. Manstein in November of 42’.

On June 1–2, 1962, events known as the [[Novocherkassk massacre]] occurred when [[food riots]] and [[workers rights]] protests broke out following a [[labor strike]] at the locomotive factory, the [[Novocherkassk Electric Locomotive Plant]], in the city. The protests were suppressed by troops of the [[Soviet Army]], resulting in 26 protesters being killed and 87 being wounded.

On November 20, 1990, [[Andrei Chikatilo]], one of the Soviet Union's most prolific [[serial killer]]s, with 56 convicted murders, was arrested in Novocherkassk. On 14 February 1994, he was taken from his death row cell to a soundproofed room in Novocherkassk prison and executed with a single gunshot behind the right ear.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iu8VAAAAIBAJ&pg=5278,1621788&hl=en|title=Russia Executes 'Rostov Ripper' Serial Killer|newspaper=[[New Straits Times]]|publisher=The New Straits Times Press|location=Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia|date=16 February 1994|access-date=25 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313022843/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iu8VAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1xMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5278,1621788&hl=en#|archive-date=13 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>''Born to Kill in the USSR'' p. 197</ref> He was buried in an [[unmarked grave]] at the prison cemetery.<ref>[https://fakty.ua/179768-andrej-chikatilo-ya-molyu-boga-chtoby-takih-kak-ya-bolshe-ne-bylo-na-zemle Андрей Чикатило: ″Я молю Бога, чтобы таких, как я, больше не было на земле!"] [[Fakty.ua]] (in Russian)</ref>

===Recent history===
On October 5–6, 1991, a meeting of the Grand Circle of the [[Union of Cossacks]] of the Don Military Region took place, where the status of the historical and modern center of the Don Cossacks was established in the city, officially making Novocherkassk the capital of the Don Cossacks. On July 17–18, 1993, a meeting of the United Supreme Circle of Cossack troops of Russia and abroad was held in [[Moscow]], where Novocherkassk was proclaimed the world capital of the Cossacks.
