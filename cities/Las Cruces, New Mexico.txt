Las Cruces is the economic and geographic center of the [[Mesilla Valley]], the agricultural region on the floodplain of the [[Rio Grande]] which extends from [[Hatch, New Mexico|Hatch]] to the west side of [[El Paso, Texas]]. Las Cruces is the home of [[New Mexico State University]] (NMSU), New Mexico's only [[land-grant university]]. The city's major employer is the federal government on nearby [[White Sands Test Facility]] and [[White Sands Missile Range]]. The [[Organ Mountains]], {{convert|10|mi|0}} to the east, are dominant in the city's landscape, along with the [[Doña Ana Mountains]], [[Robledo Mountains]], and Picacho Peak.

==History==
[[File:St. Genevieve Church in Las Cruces, New Mexico, dedicated on October 15, 1887.jpg|thumb|left|St. Genevieve Church in 1887]]
During the [[Mexican–American War]], the [[Battle of El Bracito]] was fought nearby on Christmas Day, 1846. The settlement of Las Cruces was founded in 1849 when the [[US Army]] first surveyed the town, thus opening up the area for American settlement. The town was first surveyed as the result of the American acquisition of the land surrounding Las Cruces, which later became the [[New Mexico Territory]]. This land had been ceded to the United States as a result of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] of 1848, which ended the [[Mexican-American War]].<ref name="Harris History" />{{Rp|36,40}} The town was named "Las Cruces" after three crosses which were once located just north of the town.<ref name=":1">{{cite web | year = 2012 | url = https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/62371243/historic-las-cruces | title= Historic Las Cruces | last = Schurtz | first = Christopher | publisher = Historical Publishing Network | accessdate = 2021-06-28}} See pages 9 - 11.</ref>

Initially, Mesilla became the leading settlement of the area, with more than 2,000 residents in 1860, more than twice what Las Cruces had; at that time, Mesilla had a population primarily of Mexican descent.<ref name="Harris History" />{{Rp|48}} When the [[Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway]] reached the area, the landowners of Mesilla refused to sell it the rights-of-way, and instead residents of Las Cruces donated the rights-of-way and land for a depot in Las Cruces.<ref name="Harris History" />{{Rp|58}} The first train reached Las Cruces in 1881.<ref name="Harris History" />{{Rp|62}} Las Cruces was not affected as strongly by the train as some other villages, as it was not a terminus or a crossroads, but the population did grow to 2,300 in the 1880s. Las Cruces was incorporated as a town in 1907.<ref name="Harris History" />{{Rp|135}}<ref name="Harris History" />{{Rp|63}}

[[Pat Garrett]] is best known for his involvement in the [[Lincoln County War]], but he also worked in Las Cruces on a famous case, the disappearance of [[Albert Jennings Fountain]] in 1896.<ref name="Harris History" />{{Rp|68}}

[[New Mexico State University]] was founded in 1888, and it has grown as Las Cruces has grown. The growth of Las Cruces has been attributed to the university, government jobs, and recent retirees. 
[[File:New Mexico State University Goddard Hall (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Goddard Hall (New Mexico State University)|Goddard Hall]], built in 1913.]]
The establishment of [[White Sands Missile Range]] in 1944 and [[White Sands Test Facility]] in 1963 has been integral to population growth. Las Cruces is the nearest city to each, and they provide Las Cruces' workforce with many high-paying, stable, government jobs. In recent years, the influx of retirees from out of state has also increased Las Cruces' population.

In the 1960s Las Cruces undertook a large [[urban renewal]] project, intended to convert the old downtown into a modern city center.<ref name="Harris History" />{{Rp|115}} As part of this, St. [[Genevieve]]'s Catholic Church, built in 1859, was razed to make way for a downtown [[pedestrian mall]].<ref name="Harris History" />{{Rp|44,75,115}} The original covered walkways have been removed in favor of a more traditional main street thoroughfare.

On February 10, 1990, seven people were shot, four fatally, in the [[Las Cruces bowling alley massacre]].  The incident remains unsolved.

==Geography==
[[File:LasCruces NewMexico ISS011-E-8410.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite view of Las Cruces]]
The approximate elevation of Las Cruces is {{convert|3908|ft|m|0}} above sea level.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|198.5|sqkm|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|198.1|sqkm|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.4|sqkm|order=flip|1}}, or 0.18%, is water.<ref name="Census 2010"/>

Doña Ana County lies within the [[Chihuahuan Desert]] ecoregion, and the vegetation surrounding the built portions of the city are typical of this setting; it includes creosote bush (''[[Larrea tridentata]]''), soaptree (''[[Yucca elata]]''), tarbush (''[[Flourensia cernua]]''), broom dalea (''[[Psorothamnus]] scoparius''), and various desert grasses such as tobosa (''[[Hilaria mutica]]'' or ''Pleuraphis mutica'') and black grama (''[[Bouteloua eriopoda]]'').

The [[Rio Grande]] bisects the Mesilla Valley and passes west of Las Cruces proper, supplying irrigation water for the intensive agriculture surrounding the city.<ref name=":3">{{cite web|title=Elephant Butte Irrigation District|url=http://www.ebid-nm.org/wris2008/index.asp|access-date=22 December 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911052259/http://www.ebid-nm.org/wris2008/index.asp|archive-date=11 September 2013}}</ref> However, since the institution of water rights, the Rio Grande fills its banks only when water is released from upstream dams, which before 2020 usually occurred at least from March to September.<ref name="gu-2021-01-12">{{cite web | last=Minardi | first=Di | title=A river used to run through it: how New Mexico handles a dwindling Rio Grande | website=the Guardian | date=2021-01-12 | url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/12/rio-grande-new-mexico-river-water | access-date=2021-01-12}}</ref> [[Drought]] conditions,<ref name="latimes.com">{{cite news| title=New Mexico is the driest of the dry |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-me-parched-20130806-dto,0,5922502.htmlstory#axzz2oFc0nGAC| access-date=22 December 2013| newspaper=Los Angeles Times| date=Aug 6, 2013}}</ref> exacerbated by climate change, mean that the Rio Grande experiences increasingly short or small flows.<ref name="gu-2021-01-12"/>

Prior to farming and ranching, desert shrub vegetation extended into the valley from the adjacent deserts, including extensive stands of tornillo (''[[Prosopis pubescens]]'') and catclaw acacia (''[[Acacia greggii]]''). Desert grasslands extend in large part between the edges of Las Cruces and the lower slopes of the nearby Organ and Robledo Mountains, where grasses and assorted shrubs and cacti dominate large areas of this mostly rangeland as well as the occasional large-lot subdivision housing.

The desert and desert grassland uplands surrounding both sides of the Mesilla Valley are often dissected with [[Arroyo (watercourse)|arroyos]], dry streams that often carry water following heavy thunderstorms. These arroyos often contain scattered small trees, and they serve as wildlife corridors between Las Cruces' urban areas and adjacent deserts or mountains.

===Cityscape===
[[File:LasCrucesNM WellsFargoTower.jpg|right|thumb|[[Wells Fargo Tower (Las Cruces)|Wells Fargo Tower]] is the tallest building in downtown Las Cruces]]

Unlike many cities its size, Las Cruces lacks a true central business district. This is because in the 1960s an urban-renewal project tore down a large part of the original downtown. Many chain stores and national restaurants are located in the rapidly developing east side. Las Cruces' shopping mall and a variety of retail stores and restaurants are located in this area.

However, the historic downtown of the city is the area around Main Street, a six-block stretch of which was closed off in 1973 to form a pedestrianized shopping area. The downtown mall has an extensive farmers market each Wednesday and Saturday morning, where a variety of foods and cultural items can be purchased from numerous small stands that are set up by local farmers, artists and craftspeople.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web| title = Farmers' and Crafts Market of Las Cruces {{!}} FCMLC| url = http://www.fcmlc.org| website = www.fcmlc.org| access-date = 2015-10-28}}</ref> This area also contains museums, businesses, restaurants, churches, art galleries and theaters, which add a great deal to the changing character of Las Cruces' historic downtown.

In August 2005, a [[comprehensive planning|master plan]] was adopted, the centerpiece of which was the restoration of narrow lanes of two-way traffic on this model portion of Main Street. Main Street was reopened to vehicular traffic in 2012.

In February 2013, Las Cruces Mayor [[Ken Miyagishima]] announced during his "State of the City" address that a {{convert|700|acre|adj=on}} park in the area behind the Las Cruces Dam was under construction, in cooperation with the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]]. The area features trails through restored wetlands and serves as a major refuge for [[migratory bird]]s and a key recreational area for the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://krwg.org/post/full-text-las-cruces-state-city-address|title=Full Text: Las Cruces State Of The City Address|first=KRWG News And|last=Partners|date=13 February 2013 }}</ref>

===Climate===
[[File:Jardin de Mesquite Las Cruces New Mexico.jpg|thumb|left|Jardín de Mesquite]]
Las Cruces has a [[cool desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BWk''). Winters alternate between colder and windier weather following trough and frontal passages, and warmer, sunnier periods; light freezes occur 69 nights on average. Spring months can be windy, particularly in the afternoons, sometimes causing periods of blowing dust and short-lived dust storms. Summers begin with the hottest weather of the year, with some extended periods of over {{convert|100|°F|°C|1}} temperatures not uncommon, while the latter half of the summer sees increased humidity and frequent afternoon thunderstorms, with slightly lower daytime temperatures. Autumns feature decreasing temperatures and decreasing precipitation.

Precipitation is very light from October to June, with only occasional winter storm systems bringing any precipitation to the Las Cruces area. Most winter moisture is in the form of rain, though some light snowfalls happen most winters, usually enough to accumulate and stay on the ground for a few hours. Summer precipitation is often from heavy thunderstorms, especially from the late summer [[monsoon]] weather pattern.
[[File:Veterans Memorial Park Las Cruces New Mexico.jpg|thumb|right|[[Las Cruces Veterans Memorial Park]]]]
Since records began in 1892, the lowest temperature recorded at New Mexico State University has been {{convert|−10|°F|°C|1}} on January 11, 1962 – though only ten nights have ever fallen to or below {{convert|0|°F|°C|1}} – and the highest {{convert|110|°F|°C|1}} on June 28, 1994. The lowest maximum on record is {{convert|16|°F|°C|1}} on January 28, 1948, and the highest minimum {{convert|83|°F|°C|1}} on June 8, 2024. The wettest calendar year has been 1941 with {{convert|19.60|in|mm|1}}, although 1905 with {{convert|17.09|in|mm|1}} is the only other year to exceed {{convert|15|in|mm}}. The only months to exceed {{convert|6|in|mm}} have been September 1941 with {{convert|7.53|in|mm|1}} and August 1935 with {{convert|7.41|in|mm|1}}. The wettest single day has been August 30, 1935 with {{convert|6.49|in|mm|1}} and the driest calendar year 1970 with {{convert|3.44|in|mm|1}}.
