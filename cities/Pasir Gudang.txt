'''Pasir Gudang''' is a [[List of cities in Malaysia|city]] in [[Johor Bahru District]], [[Johor]], [[Malaysia]]. The main industries are transportation and logistics, shipbuilding, petrochemicals and other heavy industries, and [[oil palm]] storage and distribution, which is located in [[Johor Port]] and [[Tanjung Langsat]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forwarder-cn.com/Shipping/Shenzhen-Port-Shipping-to-Pasir-Gudang.html|title=Shenzhen Port China Shipping to Pasir Gudang|website=www.forwarder-cn.com}}</ref>

==History==
Established in 1918, Pasir Gudang, which was formerly known as Kampung Pasir Udang, was founded by Long Abu who is believed to have originated from Riau, Indonesia. Four more villages were established by the expanded population of about 83 families.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mppg.gov.my/en/visitors/pasir-gudang-background|title=City Background|date=2 January 2016}}</ref>

*'''Kampung Pasir Gudang Baru'''. (known as Kampung Pasir Gudang Lama located at TNB Sultan Iskandar Power Station)
*'''Kampung Sungai Perembi'''. (currently the Pasir Gudang Police Station)
*'''Kampung Ulu''' (currently MSE dockyard)
*'''Kampung Tengah''' (currently the Tenaga Nasional area)
*'''Kampung Hilir'''.

In 1920, 4 more villages were established :

*'''Kampung Air Biru''' (now the port).
*'''Kampung Pasir Merah''' (now the port).
*'''[[Kampung Pasir Putih|Kampung Pasir Puteh]]''', which is still in existence today.
*'''Kampung Pulau Tekong''', now the territory of Singapore.

The name Pasir Gudang originated from the existence of a sand mine at Kampung Ulu. Sand or 'pasir' in [[Malay language|Malay]] are dug and stocked in sand pits/stores or 'gudang' in Malay, to be exported to Singapore, hence the name 'Pasir Gudang'.

The surrounding areas further inland were developed in the mid-19th century by Chinese travellers of the [[Teochew people|Teochew]] [[clan]]. Issuance of the 'river deed' by the Sultan of Johore allowed them to develop the Kangkar Masai, Kangkar Plentong and Kangkar Lunchu areas under riverheads known as 'kangchus'. It was on these riverbeds that they cultivated catechu and [[black pepper]]. Falling [[catechu]] and black pepper prices forced some estate owners to cultivate [[pineapples]].

The introduction of rubber into Malaysia in the early 20th century resulted in the opening of big estates by the British and Singaporean cultivators. Up till 1916, six estates covering an area of 15,000 acres (61&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) were opened in the Mukim of Plentong. In 1916, Kampung Pasir Gudang became the centre for Police, Customs and opium-control besides being a centre for the 'penghulu' of the Mukim of Pasir Gudang. The formation of estates had also resulted in influx of labourers from China and India.

The [[Japanese occupation of Malaya, North Borneo and Sarawak|Japanese occupation]] during the [[Second World War]] and guerrilla movements after the war did not have much effect on the agricultural activities here. Under the Emergency Law in the 1950s, new villages were set up at Plentong, [[Masai, Johor]] and Pasir Gudang{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}. The estate labourers were either placed in these new villages or at guarded estate barracks.

Land schemes under the [[Federal Land Development Authority|FELDA]] scheme were founded in Ban Foo, Plentong Baru and Felda Cahaya Baru after 1969. To further develop Johor, the State Government further took the estate lands to be converted into industrial and housing areas to the develop Pasir Gudang into an industrial area.

On 1 July 2008, Pasir Gudang Municipal Council ({{lang-ms|Majlis Perbandaran Pasir Gudang}}) was established.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mppg.gov.my/ms/mppg/profil/latar-belakang/page/0/1 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908112210/http://www.mppg.gov.my/ms/mppg/profil/latar-belakang/page/0/1 |archive-date=2016-09-08 |title=Latar Belakang {{!}} Portal Rasmi Majlis Perbandaran Pasir Gudang (MPPG)}}</ref> On 22 November 2020, the municipal council was upgraded to Pasir Gudang City Council ({{lang-ms|Majlis Bandaraya Pasir Gudang}}}).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2020/11/643310/sultan-johor-proclaims-pasir-gudang-city|title=Sultan of Johor proclaims Pasir Gudang a city &#124; New Straits Times|date=22 November 2020}}</ref>
