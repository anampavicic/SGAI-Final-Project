'''Tianshui''' is a [[prefecture-level city]] in [[Gansu]] [[list of Chinese provinces|province]], [[China]], and is the province's second-largest city (behind the provincial capital [[Lanzhou]]). Located in the southeast of the province, the city strides along the upper reaches of the [[Wei River]] and at the boundary of  the [[Loess Plateau]] and the [[Qinling|Qinling Mountains]]. As of the 2020 census, its population was 2,984,659 inhabitants, of which 1,212,791 lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of the 2 urban districts of [[Qinzhou_District|Qinzhou]] and [[Maiji District|Maiji]].<ref name="citypopulation.de"/> The city and its surroundings have played an important role in the early history of China, as still visible in the form of historic sites such as the [[Maijishan Grottoes]].

==History==
[[state of Qin|Qin]], whose [[Family tree of Chinese monarchs (Warring States period)#Qin|House of Ying]] were the ruling family of the [[Qin dynasty|founding dynasty]] of Imperial China, developed from [[Quanqiu]] (present-day [[Li County, Gansu|Lixian]]) to the south. After the invasions of the [[Xirong|Rong]] which unseated the [[Western Zhou dynasty|Western Zhou]], Qin recovered the territory of Tianshui from the nomads. It became an important region of their duchy and, later, kingdom.<ref>''People's Daily Online''. "[http://english.people.com.cn/200602/20/eng20060220_244270.html Chinese surname history: Qin]".</ref> Characteristically Qin tombs have been excavated at [[Fangmatan]] nearby, including one 2200-year-old map of [[state of Qin|Qin]]'s [[Gui County (Qin)|Gui County]].<ref>''Xinhua Online''. "[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2002-04/30/content_378835.htm Over 2,200-Year-old Map Discovered in NW China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312011236/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2002-04/30/content_378835.htm |date=2007-03-12 }}".</ref>

Under the [[Qin Empire]], the area was part of [[Longxi Commandery]] but the [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] of the [[Han dynasty|Han]] separated the region as the [[Tianshui Commandery]] in 114 BC as part of his expansion towards the [[Tarim Basin]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-g7lAAAAMAAJ&q=%E5%A4%A9%E6%B0%B4%E7%A7%A6%E5%B2%AD+%E9%BB%83%E5%9C%9F%E9%AB%98%E5%8E%9F|title=甘肃大辞典|date=2000|publisher=甘肃文化出版社|isbn=978-7-80608-547-9|language=zh}}</ref> The general [[Li Guang]] came from the city. The Han conquests and explorations eventually resulted in the development of the [[Northern Silk Road]]: Tianshui formed its junction with the [[Wei River]], after which it followed the road past [[Mount Long]] to [[Chang'an]] (present-day [[Xi'an]]).<ref>Hogan, C. Michael. ''The Megalithic Portal''. "[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18006 Silk Road, North China]".</ref> Nearby are the [[Maijishan Grottoes]], filled with thousands of [[Buddhism in China|Buddhist]] sculptures representing figures such as [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and the original male form of [[Guanyin]], produced between the [[Northern Wei|Wei]] and [[Song Dynasty|Song]] [[list of Chinese dynasties|dynasties]] by monks travelling along the road and by local Buddhists.<ref>Shrotriya, Alok & al. "[http://www.asianart.com/articles/alok/index.html Artistic treasures of Maiji Mountain caves]".</ref>

During the [[Northern Wei dynasty|Northern Wei]], the city was known as '''Hanyang''' and was the center of the Hanyang Commandery. During the [[Western Wei dynasty|Western Wei]], this name was changed to Hanyang County. During the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Five Dynasties]], the city of Tianshui was known as '''Shanggui''' ({{lang|zh|上邽}}). It alternated with [[Chengji]] (present-day [[Qin'an]]) as the capital of the [[zhou (Chinese province)|province]] of [[Qin Prefecture (Gansu)|Qinzhou]] ({{lang|zh|秦州}}).<ref name=dud>Dudbridge, Glen. ''A Portrait of Five Dynasties China: From the Memoirs of Wang Renyu (880&ndash;956)'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=rEgjlZjMd7sC&pg=PA8 pp. 8 ff.] Oxford University Press (Oxford), 2013. Accessed 14 Dec 2013.</ref> [[Li County, Gansu|Li County]] was separated from Tianshui's jurisdiction during the ninth year of [[Chenghua era|Chenghua]] (AD 1473) during the [[Ming dynasty]].

According to a legend, the name Tianshui ([[wiktionary:天水|天水]]) originates from a lake formed from heaven, which would remain the same size year round.<ref name=":1" />
