'''Aurora''' is a city in northeastern [[Illinois]], United States.

Founded within Kane County, Aurora's city limits have expanded into DuPage, [[Kendall County, Illinois|Kendall]], and [[Will County, Illinois|Will]] counties. Once a mid-sized manufacturing city, Aurora has grown since the 1960s into a large city within the [[Chicago metropolitan area]]. In 1908, Aurora adopted the nickname "City of Lights", because in 1881 it was one of the first cities in the United States to implement an all-electric street lighting system.<ref>Following [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and [[Wabash, Indiana]].{{cite web|title=About Our City |url=http://www.aurora-il.org/aboutourcity.php |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120729181648/http://www.aurora-il.org/aboutourcity.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 July 2012 |publisher=City of Aurora, IL |access-date=25 September 2011 |year=2011 }}</ref> 

Aurora's historic downtown is centered on [[Stolp Island]]. The city is divided into three regions, the West Side, East Side, and Far East Side/Fox Valley. The Aurora area has some significant architecture, including structures by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], [[Bruce Goff]] and [[George Grant Elmslie]]. Aurora is also home to over 50 [[Sears Catalog Home]]s and seven [[Lustron house|Lustron]] all-steel homes. The Hollywood Casino Aurora, a dockside gaming facility with {{convert|53,000|sqft|m2}} and 1,200 gaming positions, is located along the river in downtown Aurora.

==History==
[[File:Leland Tower from Galena.JPG|thumb|View of Stolp Island historic buildings from Downer Place with architectural details, such as these [[terracotta]] tiles.]]
Before European settlers arrived, there was a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] village in what is today downtown Aurora, on the banks of the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]]. In 1834, following the [[Black Hawk War]], the McCarty brothers settled on both sides of the river, but subsequently sold their land on the west side to the Lake brothers, who opened a mill. The McCartys lived on and operated a mill on the east side.<ref name=Encyclopedia>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/91.html|title=Aurora, IL|website=www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org|access-date=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210094756/http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/91.html|archive-date=10 December 2008}}</ref> Aurora was established with the building of a post office in 1837.

Aurora began as two villages: East Aurora, incorporated in 1845<ref name="genealogytrails.com">{{cite web|url=http://genealogytrails.com/ill/kane/aurora.html|title=History of Aurora, Illinois|first=K.|last=Torp|website=genealogytrails.com|access-date=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709131951/http://genealogytrails.com/ill/kane/aurora.html|archive-date=9 July 2012}}</ref> on the east side of the river, and West Aurora, formally organized on the west side of the river in 1854.<ref name="genealogytrails.com"/> In 1857, the two towns joined, incorporating as the city of Aurora.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| url = http://genealogytrails.com/ill/kane/aurora.html| title = Aurora Township, Kane County, Illinois| encyclopedia = Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois| publisher = Kane County Illinois Genealogy Trails| access-date = 24 September 2011| url-status = live| archive-url = https://archive.today/20120709131951/http://genealogytrails.com/ill/kane/aurora.html| archive-date = 9 July 2012}}</ref>  Representatives could not agree which side of the river should house the public buildings, so most of them were built on or around [[Stolp Island]] in the middle of the river.

As the city grew, it attracted numerous factories and jobs. In 1849, after failing to attract the [[Galena and Chicago Union Railroad]] building west from Chicago, the [[Aurora Branch Railroad]] was chartered to build a connection from Aurora to the G&CU at a place called Turner Junction, now [[West Chicago]]. Additional lines were built, including a direct line to Chicago, and in 1855 the company was reorganized into the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jhc4AAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA96 An act granting a charter to the Aurora Branch Railroad Company], approved February 12, 1849</ref><ref name=ICC>{{val rep|Chicago Burlington & Quincy Railroad Company|715|134|I|1|year=1927|intlink=Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad}}</ref> The CB&Q located its [[Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Roundhouse and Locomotive Shop|roundhouse and locomotive shop]] in Aurora, becoming the town's largest employer until the 1960s. Restructuring in the railroad industry resulted in a loss of jobs as passenger traffic dropped and the number of railroads decreased. The Burlington Railroad ran regularly scheduled passenger trains to Chicago.<ref>The Burlington Railroad operated passenger trains between Chicago and Aurora for over 100 years, since Aurora was an important suburb. See "Chicago-Aurora Centennial, 1864–1964" (Burlington Railroad, 1964).</ref> Other railroads built lines to Aurora, including the [[Chicago & Northwestern Railway]] to [[Geneva, Illinois|Geneva]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Aurora to Geneva, IL |url=https://www.abandonedrails.com/aurora-to-geneva |website=AbandonedRails.com |access-date=28 November 2021}}</ref> the [[Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway]] to [[Joliet, Illinois|Joliet]],<ref>{{cite web |title=The Aurora Branch |url=https://www.abandonedrails.com/aurora-branch |website=AbandonedRails.com |access-date=28 November 2021}}</ref> [[Milwaukee Road|Chicago, Milwaukee & Gary]] to [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]],<ref>{{cite web |title=The Gary Line |url=https://www.abandonedrails.com/gary-line |website=AbandonedRails.com |access-date=28 November 2021}}</ref> and the interurbans [[Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad]], [[Aurora, Elgin and Fox River Electric Company]], [[Chicago, Aurora and DeKalb Railroad]], and [[Aurora, Plainfield and Joliet Railroad]]. With the exception of the EJ&E main line on the east side of the city, all lines other than the former Burlington lines have been abandoned.

The heavy industries on the East side provided employment for generations of European immigrants, who came from [[Ireland]], [[Great Britain]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Romania]] and [[Italy]]. Aurora became the economic center of the [[Fox Valley (Illinois)|Fox Valley region]]. The combination of these three factors—a highly industrialized town, a sizable river that divided it, and the Burlington railroad's shops—accounted for much of the dynamics of Aurora's political, economic, and social history. The city openly supported [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]] before the [[American Civil War]]. [[Mexico|Mexican]] migrants began arriving after the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1910. Socially, the town was [[progressivism|progressive]] in its attitude toward education, religion, welfare, and women. The first free public school district in Illinois was established in 1851 here and the city established a high school for girls in 1855.

During this period in the city's history, Aurora was also hit with one of the strongest earthquakes ever [[List of earthquakes in Illinois|to strike Illinois]], a M 5.1, on May 26, 1909<ref>{{cite web
| url = https://doi.org/10.1785/0120130003

| access-date = October 22, 2024}}</ref>

Later, the city developed as a manufacturing powerhouse which lasted until the early 1970s, when the railroad shops closed. Many other factories and industrial areas relocated or went out of business. By 1980, there were few industrial areas operating in the city, and unemployment soared to 16%.<ref name=Encyclopedia/> During the late 1970s and early 1980s, development began in the Far East side along the Eola Road and Route 59 areas. This was financially beneficial to the city, but it sapped retail businesses downtown and manufacturing in the industrial sectors of the near East and West Sides, weakening them. In the mid-1980s crime rates soared and street gangs formed.

During this time Aurora became much more ethnically diverse. The Latino population grew rapidly in the city during the 1980s. In the late 1980s, several business and industrial parks were established on the city's outskirts. In 1993, the Hollywood Casino was built downtown, which helped bring the first redevelopment to the downtown area in nearly twenty years. In the late 1990s, more development began in the rural areas and towns outside Aurora. Subdivisions sprouted up around the city, and Aurora's population soared.

Like other large Midwestern cities that once relied on manufacturing as an economic basis, Aurora has a large number of abandoned buildings and vacant lots, especially in older sections of the city. Efforts are ongoing to rehabilitate these areas.

Environmentally, Aurora has long dealt with pollution of the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]]. The river was heavily polluted up until the 1970s by factories that had lined the river for over a century. Cleanup efforts have been successful with the help of state grants and volunteer efforts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Illinois EPA Director presents $300,000 grant to Mayor of Aurora for watershed protection efforts |url=http://www.illinois.gov/PressReleases/ShowPressRelease.cfm?SubjectID=18&RecNum=5880 |publisher=State of Illinois |work=Illinois Government News Network |date=23 April 2007 |access-date=25 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402054109/http://www.illinois.gov/PressReleases/ShowPressRelease.cfm?SubjectID=18&RecNum=5880 |archive-date=2 April 2012 }}</ref>

==Economy==
Aurora is on the edge of the [[Illinois Technology and Research Corridor]]. The city has a long tradition of manufacturing as does much of [[Chicago metropolitan area]]. Prominent manufacturers, past and present include Lyon Workspace Products, The Aurora Silverplate Manufacturing Company, Barber-Greene Company, the Chicago Corset Company, the Aurora Brewing Company, Stephens-Adamson Company, [[Caterpillar Inc.]], Western Electric, Allsteel Metals, National Metalwares, and Western Wheeled Scraper Works (later Austin-Western Inc.). The most prominent employer and industry was the Chicago Burlington and Quincy Railroad (later [[Burlington Northern Railroad|Burlington Northern]]) which was headquartered in Aurora.

===Largest employers===

===Tourism===
Formed in 1987, the Aurora Area Convention and Visitors Bureau (AACVB) is a private, nonprofit organization dedicated to aggressively promoting and marketing the area as a premier overnight destination. The AACVB'S goal is to enhance the economic and environmental well-being of a region comprising ten communities: Aurora, [[Batavia, Illinois|Batavia]], [[Big Rock, Illinois|Big Rock]], Hinckley, [[Montgomery, Illinois|Montgomery]], [[North Aurora, Illinois|North Aurora]], [[Oswego, Illinois|Oswego]], [[Plano, Illinois|Plano]], [[Sugar Grove, Illinois|Sugar Grove]], and [[Yorkville, Illinois|Yorkville]].{{cn|date=April 2024}}

==Arts and culture==
[[File:Downtown Aurora, IL.jpg|thumb|Downtown Aurora]]
[[File:Paramount Theatre - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Paramount Theatre (Aurora, Illinois)|Paramount Theatre]]]]
Downtown Aurora is home to the [[Paramount Theatre (Aurora, Illinois)|Paramount Theatre]], a large live performance theater on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and the [[Hollywood Casino Aurora|Hollywood Casino]]. There is also the [[Leland Tower]], a former hotel that was the tallest building in Illinois outside of Chicago and is on the National Register of Historic Places. The largest collection of commercial buildings by [[Prairie School]] architect [[George Grant Elmslie]] is here. The main building of Aurora Public Library and a branch campus of [[Waubonsee Community College]] are also located downtown.

The Riverfront Playhouse is a not-for-profit theater that has held a storefront location in downtown Aurora since 1978.<ref>[http://www.riverfrontplayhouse.com Riverfront Playhouse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030414092901/http://www.riverfrontplayhouse.com/ |date=2003-04-14 }} Official Site</ref>

A fixture of Downtown Aurora, the Waubonsee Community College Campus, which was formerly located on Stolp Island near the Paramount Theatre, closed in May 2011. A new and greatly expanded campus was built on the western banks of the river, between the river and IL Route 31.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History {{!}} Waubonsee Community College|url=https://www.waubonsee.edu/about-waubonsee/history|access-date=2021-05-04|website=www.waubonsee.edu}}</ref> The construction of the campus was part of a larger plan to redevelop the Downtown area, putting in parks and new walking paths, and making the area more inviting. The plan also included a pedestrian bridge to connect the banks of the river. Also in the works is a plan to modify or reconstruct the bridges to Stolp Island, which have not been maintained for nearly 60 years.

===Public education===
Starting in the 1860s, Aurora was served by two main school systems, one on either side of the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]], which physically divides the city. In the mid-20th century, the district on the western side of the river expanded to include the students in the village of North Aurora, including the North Aurorans on the east side of the Fox.  Additionally, in 1972, the Indian Prairie School District (IPSD) 204 was formed to serve the far eastern portion of Aurora within [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]]. All three districts (Aurora Public Schools: West Side (District 129), Aurora Public Schools: East Side (District 131) and IPSD) have their headquarters and administrative offices within the Aurora city limits. As of 2005, there were at least forty public schools within Aurora city limits, serving residents of Aurora and neighboring communities.

Due to the city's size, these are not the only three school systems serving residents – some students in the far north end of the city (north of [[Interstate 88 (west)|I88]] in Kane County) attend [[Batavia, Illinois|Batavia]] public schools, some on the far southwest side attend Kaneland CUSD 302 schools (headquartered in [[Maple Park, Illinois|Maple Park]]), and some students in the far south end of the city (a small corner of the Kane, Kendall and Will County portions) attend [[Oswego, Illinois|Oswego]] public schools. Four of the schools in Oswego CUSD 308, Wheatlands Elementary, Homestead Elementary, Wolf's Crossing Elementary, and Bednarcik Junior High are within Aurora's limits.

The [[Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy]] (IMSA) is a state-funded residential [[magnet school]] for grades 10 to 12. While IMSA operates under public funds (and uses the site originally designated West Aurora High School North Campus), it is managed independently of Aurora's other public schools. Any Illinois student who meets admission requirements may apply to attend IMSA, tuition free.
The above-named districts have forty-six public schools within the city limits of Aurora (seventeen for District #131, thirteen for District #129, eleven for District #204, four for Oswego District #308 and the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy).
