'''Itabuna''' is a [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] in [[Bahia]], [[Brazil]]. It is the 6th largest city in Bahia by population after Salvador, Feira de Santana, Camaçari, Vitória da Conquista, and Juazeiro. It had an estimated 214,123 residents in 2021. Itabuna covers a total area of {{convert|401|km2|mi2}} and has a population density of 550 residents per square kilometer.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ibge.gov.br/cidades-e-estados/ba/itabuna.html | title=Itabuna (BA) &#124; Cidades e Estados &#124; IBGE }}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Itabuna" derives from Tupiniquim ''itáabuna'', meaning ''father of stone'' (''itá'', stone + ''abuna'', father). This name refers to a rock the Tupiniquim thought reminded them of a father and was bigger than the other stones around.<ref>[[Eduardo de Almeida Navarro|Navarro, E. A.]] ''[[Dictionary of Old Tupi|Dicionário de tupi antigo: a língua indígena clássica do Brasil]]''. São Paulo. Global. 2013. p. 571.</ref>

==History==

The Portuguese arrived in the 16th century. The region was inhabited by the [[Tupiniquim]], an indigenous group of the larger Tupi people. The Portuguese established the Captaincy of Ilhéus in the region, but it failed due to attacks by the nomadic Aimoré people, who emerged from the interior of Brazil in the 1550s. Settlement began when the region served as the main crossing point for drovers heading to Vitória da Conquista. In the region crossed by the Cachoeira river, Arraial de Tabocas emerged in 1857, in the middle of a forest that had not yet been explored at the time.
The name Tabocas, according to the tradition, is due to a huge jequitibá, whose felling had been disputed, being the 'pau da taboca', that is, the swidden that opened.
The region was populated by non-native Brazilians from 1867, mainly by migrants from [[Sergipe]]. Felix Severino de Oliveira, later known as Félix Severino do Amor Divino, and José Firmino Alves, his cousin, founded Fazenda Marimbeta, a farm, in the municipality. A street remains with the name in the Conceição of Itabuna. Itabuna was emancipated from [[Ilhéus]] in 1910.  In 1978, the city became the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Itabuna]].<ref name="i"/>

Itabuna used to be very wealthy due to the amount of [[Cacao bean|cacao]] farms around it. It was once the second largest exporter of cacao in Brazil. The cacao boom however was short lived due to a disease called [[witch's broom]]. The economy of itabuna is now weak compared to cities of similar size and location.

In December 2021, the town was flooded after two dams burst.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Brazilian town floods after two dams collapse|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-latin-america-59801025|access-date=2021-12-27}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Centro de Itabuna.jpg|thumb|left|Avenue Amélia Amado, downtown. Buildings in the background]]

Itabuna is a regional center of [[commerce]], [[Industrial sector|industry]] and [[Service (economics)|services]], along with its neighbour [[Ilhéus]]. Its economic importance grew during the ''golden era'' of [[Theobroma cacao|cocoa]] cultivation. Thanks to its fertile [[soil]], the city became the second biggest producer of cocoa in Brazil, exporting to the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. After the devastation of crops caused by the [[fungus]] ''Crinipellis perniciosa'' (which causes a disease known as [[witch's broom]]), which led to a profound crisis in its economy, the city began to search a diversification of its economical activities. Nowadays, Itabuna is one of the most important trade points located along [[BR-101]] Highway in Bahia.

==Sport==
[[Itabuna Esporte Clube|Itabuna EC]] is the local [[association football]] team.
