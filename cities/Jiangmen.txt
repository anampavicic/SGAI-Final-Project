Jiangmen is the [[pinyin]] [[romanization of Chinese|romanization]] of the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name {{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|江門}}}} or {{lang|zh-hans|{{linktext|江门}}}}, based on its pronunciation in the [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] [[dialects of Chinese|dialect]]. Its former [[Wade-Giles]] spelling was {{nowrap|'''Chiang-men'''}}.

Jiangmen is also known as '''Pengjiang'''.{{clarify|date=October 2016}}{{why|date=October 2016}} Its rural hinterland is known to the [[Chinese diaspora]] as the "[[Siyi|Four Counties]]" ([[q.v.]]), although the addition of [[Heshan, Guangdong|Heshan]] to Jiangmen has prompted the remaining locals to begin calling it the "Five Counties" instead.

On 6 August 1925, the Guangdong provincial government placed Jiangmen under direct administration of the provincial government.<ref name=":0" /> Jiangmen was given a city government on 26 November of the same year.<ref name=":0" /> In 1931, this status would be revoked, and the city was placed under the administration of [[Xinhui County]].<ref name=":0" />

The city was incorporated into the People's Republic of China on 23 October 1949, and was proclaimed a city in 1951.<ref name=":0" /> The city later became the prefectural seat for the [[Sze Yup]] ("Four County") region including [[Taishan, Guangdong|Taishan]], [[Kaiping]], [[Xinhui]], [[Enping]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=A Village That Bred Talent |url=https://www.quonquon.com/a-village-that-bred-talent.html |access-date=2022-04-27 |website=QUON QUON |language=en}}</ref> In [[Mainland China]] but not [[overseas Chinese|abroad]], the area became known as the "Five Counties" when [[Heshan, Guangdong|Heshan]] was added to Jiangmen's jurisdiction.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}
