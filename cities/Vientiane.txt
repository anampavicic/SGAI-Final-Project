'''Vientiane'''{{efn|{{IPAc-en|v|i|,|ɛ|n|t|i|ˈ|ɑː|n}} {{respell|vee|EN|tee|AHN}}; {{langx|lo|ວຽງຈັນ}}, ''Viangchan'', {{IPA-lo|wíaŋ tɕàn|pron}}, {{RTGS|''Wiang Chan''}}}} is the [[capital city|capital]] and largest city of [[Laos]]. Comprising the five [[Metropolitan area|urban]] [[Districts of Laos|districts]] of [[Vientiane Prefecture]], the city is located on the banks of the [[Mekong]], right at the border with [[Thailand]]. Vientiane was the administrative capital during French rule and, due to economic growth in recent times, is now the economic center of Laos. The city had a population of 840,000 as of the 2023 [[Census]].

Vientiane is the home of the most significant national monuments such as [[Pha That Luang]], a national symbol of Laos and an icon of [[Buddhism in Laos]]. Other significant Buddhist temples can be found there as well, such as [[Haw Phra Kaew]], which formerly housed the [[Emerald Buddha]].

==Etymology==
"Vientiane" is the French spelling derived from the Lao ''Viangchan'' {{IPA|/wíaŋ tɕàn/}}.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last1=Askew |first1=Marc |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DNJ_e6FKjrwC&q=vientiane+sandalwood+moon&pg=PA46 |title=Vientiane: Transformations of a Lao Landscape |last2=Long |first2=Colin |last3=Logan |first3=William |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-134-32365-4 |pages=15, 46 |language=en |access-date=22 November 2020 |archive-date=16 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231116182326/https://books.google.com/books?id=DNJ_e6FKjrwC&q=vientiane+sandalwood+moon&pg=PA46#v=snippet&q=vientiane%20sandalwood%20moon&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref> The name was previously written "{{lang|lo|ວຽງຈັນທນ໌}}" (in Thai, เวียงจันทน์) but now usually written "{{lang|lo|ວຽງຈັນ}}".

===Dvaravati city state kingdoms===
By the 6th century in the [[Chao Phraya River]] Valley, [[Mon people]]s had coalesced to create the [[Dvaravati|Dvaravati kingdoms]]. In the north, [[Haripunjaya]] ([[Lamphun]]) emerged as a rival power to the [[Dvaravati]]. By the 8th century the Mon had pushed north to create city states, in Fa Daet (modern [[Kalasin]], northeastern Thailand), Sri Gotapura (Sikhottabong) near modern [[Tha Khek District|Tha Khek]], Laos, [[Muang Sua]] ([[Luang Prabang]]), and Chantaburi (Vientiane). In the 8th century CE, Sri Gotapura (Sikhottabong) was the strongest of these early city states, and controlled trade throughout the middle Mekong region. The city states were loosely bound politically, but were culturally similar and introduced [[Therevada Buddhism]] from [[Sri Lanka]]n missionaries throughout the region.<ref name="Viravond">{{cite web |url=http://www.reninc.org/bookshelf/history_of_laos_viravong.pdf |title=HISTORY OF LAOS |author=Maha Sila Viravond |access-date=December 29, 2017 |publisher=Refugee Educators' Network |archive-date=3 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200403030051/http://www.reninc.org/bookshelf/history_of_laos_viravong.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Manich">{{cite web |url=http://www.reninc.org/bookshelf/history_of_laos_manich.pdf |title=HISTORY OF LAOS (includlng the hlstory of Lonnathai, Chiangmai) |author=M.L.

===Myth===
The great Laotian epic, the ''[[Phra Lak Phra Lam]]'', claims that Prince Thattaradtha founded the city when he left the legendary Lao kingdom of ''Muong Inthapatha Maha Nakhone'' because he was denied the throne in favor of his younger brother. Thattaradtha founded a city called ''Maha Thani Si Phan Phao'' on the western banks of the [[Mekong|Mekong River]]; this city was said to have later become today's [[Udon Thani]], [[Thailand]]. One day, a seven-headed [[Naga (mythology)|Naga]] told Thattaradtha to start a new city on the east bank of the river opposite ''Maha Thani Si Phan Phao''. The prince called this city ''Chanthabuly Si Sattanakhanahud''; which was said to be the predecessor of modern Vientiane.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Contrary to the ''Phra Lak Phra Lam'', most historians believe Vientiane was an early Mon settlement, which later came under the domination of the Khmer Empire. In the 11th and 12th centuries, the time when the [[Lao people|Lao]] and [[Thai people]] are believed to have entered [[Southeast Asia]] from [[Southern China]], the few remaining Mon and Khmer in the area moved or assimilated into the Lao civilization, which would soon overtake the area.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Khmer domination===

The earliest reference of the name Vientiane can be seen on a Vietnamese inscription of Duke [[Đỗ Anh Vũ]], dated 1159 during the Khmer-Viet conflict. The inscription says that in 1135, Văn Đan (Vientiane), a vassal of Zhenla ([[Khmer Empire]]), invaded Nghe An, but was repelled by the Duke; the Duke led an army chased the invaders as far as Vũ Ôn? (unattested), and then returned with captives.<ref name=Taylor1995>{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=K. W. |title=Essays Into Vietnamese Pasts |year=1995 |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=978-1-501-71899-1}}</ref>{{rp|65}} This name may have traced it origin to ''Wèndān'', a supposedly kingdom located in the [[Khorat Plateau]], mentioned by a ninth-century Chinese writer described a trade route which started at [[Hanoi]] and crossed the western mountains to Wèndān.

===Lan Xang and French colonial rule===
In 1354, when [[Fa Ngum]] founded the kingdom of [[Lan Xang]],<ref name=Coedes>{{cite book |last=Coedès |first=George |author-link=George Coedès |editor=Walter F. Vella |others=trans.Susan Brown Cowing |title=The Indianized States of Southeast Asia |year=1968 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=978-0-8248-0368-1}}</ref>{{rp|223}} Vientiane became an important administrative city, even though it was not made the capital. King [[Setthathirath]] officially established it as the capital of Lan Xang in 1563, to avoid Burmese invasion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20101120-248232.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816032318/http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20101120-248232.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 August 2011 |title=Vientiane marks 450 years anniversary |access-date=18 July 2015}}</ref> When Lan Xang fell apart in 1707, it became an independent [[Kingdom of Vientiane]]. In 1779, it was conquered by the Siamese general Phraya [[Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke|Chakri]] and made a vassal of [[Thailand|Siam]].

When King [[Anouvong]] raised an unsuccessful rebellion, it was obliterated by [[Thai people|Siamese]] armies in 1827. The city was burned to the ground and was looted of nearly all Laotian artifacts, including Buddha statues and people. Vientiane was in great disrepair, depopulated and disappearing into the forest when the French arrived. It eventually passed to [[French colonial empire|French]] rule in 1893. It became the capital of the French protectorate of Laos in 1899. During the French colonial period, the city was rebuilt and various Buddhist temples such as [[Pha That Luang]], [[Haw Phra Kaew]] were repaired.

During French rule, the Vietnamese were encouraged to migrate to Laos, which resulted in 53% of the population of Vientiane being Vietnamese in the year 1943.<ref name="MartinStuart-FoxA">{{Cite book |last=Stuart-Fox |first=Martin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VvvevRkX-EC&pg=PA51 |title=A History of Laos |date=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-59746-3 |page=51 |access-date=30 June 2020 |archive-date=24 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230824000153/https://books.google.com/books?id=8VvvevRkX-EC&pg=PA51 |url-status=live }}</ref> As late as 1945, the French drew up an ambitious plan to move massive Vietnamese population to three key areas (i.e. the Vientiane Plain, the [[Savannakhet Province|Savannakhet region]], and the [[Bolaven Plateau]]), which was only interrupted by the Japanese invasion of Indochina.<ref name="MartinStuart-FoxA" /> If this plan had been implemented, according to [[Martin Stuart-Fox]], the Lao might well have lost control over their own country.<ref name="MartinStuart-FoxA" />

During [[World War II]], Vientiane fell with little resistance and was occupied by Japanese forces, under the command of [[Sako Masanori]].<ref name="autogenerated4">{{cite web |title=Far East and Australasia |url=http://www.cpamedia.com/politics/japan_in_laos/ |access-date=25 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121140017/http://cpamedia.com/politics/japan_in_laos/ |archive-date=21 November 2010}}</ref> On 9 March 1945, French paratroopers arrived and reoccupied the city on 24 April 1945.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite book |date=2002 |publisher=Psychology Press |title=The Far East and Australasia 2003 |isbn=9781857431339 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e5Az1lGCJwQC&pg=PA736 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510180225/https://books.google.com/books?id=e5Az1lGCJwQC&pg=PA736 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2016-05-10 |series=Regional surveys of the world |chapter=Laos: History |last=Stuart-Fox |first=Martin |pages=735–742 |access-date=2023-02-20}}</ref>{{rp|736}}

===Independence===
The city became the national capital of the [[Kingdom of Laos|newly independent Lao state]] in 1953.

As the [[Laotian Civil War]] broke out between the [[Royal Lao Government]] and the [[Pathet Lao]], Vientiane became unstable. In August 1960, [[Kong Le]] seized the capital and insisted that [[Souvanna Phouma]] become prime minister. In mid-December, [[Phoumi Nosavan]] then seized the capital, overthrew the Phouma Government, and installed [[Boun Oum]] as prime minister. In mid-1975, Pathet Lao troops moved towards the city and Americans began evacuating the capital. On 23 August 1975, a contingent of 50 Pathet Lao women symbolically liberated the city.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> On 2 December 1975, the [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party|communist party]] of the [[Pathet Lao]] took over Vientiane, defeated the [[Kingdom of Laos]], and renamed the country the Lao People's Democratic Republic, which ended the [[Laotian Civil War]]. The next day, an [[Insurgency in Laos]] began in the jungle, with the Pathet Lao fighting factions of Hmong and royalists.

Vientiane was the host of the incident-free [[2009 Southeast Asian Games]]. Eighteen competitions were dropped from the previous games held in Thailand, due to Laos' landlocked borders and the lack of adequate facilities in Vientiane.

==Geography==
Vientiane is on a bend of the [[Mekong]] River, at which point it forms the border with [[Thailand]]. The city government administers the five urban [[Districts of Laos|districts]] of the [[Vientiane Prefecture]].

===Climate===
Vientiane features a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Aw'') with distinct [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s. Vientiane’s dry season spans from November through March. April marks the onset of the wet season which in Vientiane lasts about seven months. Vientiane tends to be very hot and humid throughout the course of the year, though temperatures in the city tend to be somewhat cooler during the dry season than the wet season.
The lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|2.4|C|F|1|disp=or}} in January 1924, and the highest was {{convert|42.6|C|F|1|disp=or}} in April 2024.

==Tourism==
[[File:Wat Si Muang.jpg|thumb|[[Wat Si Muang]]]]
[[File:Buddha park, lao pdr.jpg|thumb|[[Buddha Park]]]]
The capital attracts many tourists to its many temples and Buddhist monuments. A popular attraction for foreign visitors is [[Pha That Luang]], an important national cultural monument of Laos and one of its best known [[stupa]]s. It was originally built in 1566 by King [[Setthathirath]] and was restored in 1953. The golden stupa is {{convert|45|m}} tall and is believed to contain a relic of the Buddha.<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.tourismlaos.org/web/show_content.php?contID=328 Lao National Tourism Administration – Tourist Sites in Vientiane Capital] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723080908/http://www.tourismlaos.org/web/show_content.php?contID=328 |date=23 July 2011 }}</ref>

Another site that is also popular amongst tourists is [[Wat Si Muang]]. The temple was built on the ruins of a Khmer Hindu shrine, the remains of which can be seen behind the ordination hall.<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite web |url=http://asiaforvisitors.com/laos/vientiane/watmuang/index.html |title=Wat Si Muang |access-date=18 July 2015 |archive-date=10 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210070521/http://asiaforvisitors.com/laos/vientiane/watmuang/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref> It was built in 1563 and is believed to be guarded by the spirit of a local girl, Nang Si. Legend tells that Nang Si, who was pregnant at the time, leapt to her death as a sacrifice, just as the pillar was being lowered into the hole. In front of the temple stands a statue of King [[Sisavang Vong]].<ref name=autogenerated3 />

The memorial monument, [[Patuxai]], built between 1957 and 1968, is perhaps the most prominent landmark in the city.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> While the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in [[Paris]] inspired the architecture, the design incorporates typical Lao motifs including Kinnari, a mythical bird woman. Energetic visitors can climb to the top of the monument for a panoramic view of the city.

[[Buddha Park]] was built in 1958 by [[Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat]] and contains a collection of Buddhist and Hindu sculptures, scattered amongst gardens and trees. The park is {{convert|28|km}} south of Vientiane at the edge of the [[Mekong River]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://asiaforvisitors.com/laos/vientiane/buddha-park.php |title=Buddha Park – Vientiane – Laos – Asia for Visitors |access-date=18 July 2015 |archive-date=1 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601051330/http://asiaforvisitors.com/laos/vientiane/buddha-park.php |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Laos-China-Railway_Station_Vientiane.jpg|thumb|left|Vientiane railway station]]
The [[Thai–Lao Friendship Bridge|First Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge]], built in the 1990s, crosses the river 18&nbsp;kilometres downstream of the city of [[Nong Khai]] in Thailand, and is the major crossing between the two countries. The official name of the bridge was changed in 2007 by the addition of "First", after the [[Second Thai–Lao Friendship Bridge|Second Friendship Bridge]] linking [[Mukdahan]] in Thailand with [[Savannakhet Province|Savannakhet]] in Laos was opened early in 2007.

A [[metre gauge]] railway link over the first bridge was formally inaugurated on 5 March 2009, previously ending at [[Thanaleng Railway Station]], in Dongphosy village ([[Vientiane Prefecture]]), 20&nbsp;km east of Vientiane.<ref>{{cite news |title=Inaugural train begins Laos royal visit |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/10/inaugural-train-begins-laos-royal-visit.html |work=[[Railway Gazette International]] |date=5 March 2009 |access-date=3 August 2009 |archive-date=22 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722164527/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/10/inaugural-train-begins-laos-royal-visit.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="guardian-09">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/feb/26/first-train-laos-thailand-rail |title=First train to Laos |author=Andrew Spooner |newspaper=The Guardian |date=27 February 2009 |access-date=13 March 2011 |archive-date=11 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111183805/http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/feb/26/first-train-laos-thailand-rail |url-status=live }}</ref> As of November 2010, Lao officials plan to convert the station into a cargo rail terminal for [[freight trains]], allowing cargo to be transported from Bangkok into Laos more cheaply than via road.<ref name="trweekly-nov10">{{cite news |url=http://www.ttrweekly.com/site/2010/11/laos-rethinks-rail-project/ |title=Laos rethinks rail project |date=9 November 2010 |access-date=13 March 2011 |publisher=TTR Weekly |author=Rapeepat Mantanarat |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727101636/http://www.ttrweekly.com/site/2010/11/laos-rethinks-rail-project/ |archive-date=27 July 2011}}</ref> The rail link has since been extended 7.5km further into the city, to terminate at [[Khamsavath railway station|Vientiane (Khamsavath) railway station]], a bigger and newer station closer to the city, with connections to the Central Bus Terminal and the Laos China Railway Station.
