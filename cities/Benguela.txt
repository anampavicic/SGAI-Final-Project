'''Benguela''' ({{IPA|pt|bẽˈɡɛlɐ}}; [[Umbundu]]: Luombaka) is a city in western [[Angola]], capital of [[Benguela Province]].<ref name="b-lobito"/> Benguela is one of Angola's most populous cities with a population of 555,124 in the city and 561,775 in the municipality, at the 2014 census.<ref name =Censo2014>{{cite web |url=https://www.ine.gov.ao/images/Populacao_Sociedade/PUBLICACAO_BENGUELA__2016.pdf |title=Resultados Definitivos Recenseamento Geral da População e Habitação – 2014 Província de Benguela |access-date=3 May 2020 |website=Instituto Nacional de Estatística, República de Angola |df=dmy |archive-date=1 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101044502/https://www.ine.gov.ao/images/Populacao_Sociedade/PUBLICACAO_BENGUELA__2016.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==History==
{{main|Timeline of Benguela}}
===Portuguese rule===
{{main|Portuguese Angola}}
[[File:Atlas Van der Hagen - Reino de Benguela.jpeg|thumb|left|17th century map of Benguela.]]
[[File:Banco Nacional, Benguela, Angola (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Portuguese colonial architecture]] in the historic center of Benguela.]]
Benguela was founded in 1617 as ''São Felipe de Benguela'' by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] under Manuel Cerveira Pereira, 8th [[Governor]] of [[Portuguese West Africa|Angola]] (1604–1607).<ref> W. Martin James, ''Historical Dictionary of Angola'', Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2018, p. 54 </ref><ref name="b-lobito"/> 
It was long the centre of an important trade, especially in [[Slavery in Angola|slaves]] to [[Brazil]] and [[Cuba]]. Ships anchored about {{convert|1|mi|km|order=flip}} off the shore, in depths of {{convert|7|to|11|m}} and [[Lightering|transferred loads to smaller boats]] which used five or six [[jetty|jetties]] in the town. However, the nearby deep-water sheltered harbour of [[Lobito]] was a much larger port. 

Besides the churches of S. Felipe and S. António, the hospital, and the fortress, as of 1911 there were only a few stone-built houses.<ref name="eb1911">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Benguella|volume=3|page=737}}</ref> A short way beyond Benguela is [[Baía Farta]], where salt was manufactured and [[sulphur]] was extracted. Close to [[Baia Farta]] was the beach of [[Baia Azul]]. The city prospered and grew in the following decades. 

The [[Benguela Railway]] was built in the early 20th century by Portugal to connect the city and [[Lobito]] to the interior, and it achieved great success when linked to the [[Copperbelt]] of [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], [[DR Congo]] and [[Zambia]].<ref> Britannica,
[https://www.britannica.com/place/Benguela Benguela], britannica.com, USA, accessed on June 30, 2019</ref>

Starting in the early 20th century, Benguela attracted, developed, and retained quality businesses and professionals into its growing economy. [[Sisal]] and [[Fishing in Angola|fishing]] industries expanded and the financial, construction and services market boomed until 1974.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RimsOQsuQDs BenguelaAnosOuro.wmv], a film of Benguela, [[Overseas Province of Angola]] before 1975.</ref>

===Post-independence===
In 1975, after the April 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]] in [[Lisbon]], Portugal, the Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Angola]] became independent. 
[[File:Paços do Concelho, Benguela (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Benguela City Hall.]]
Due to the [[Angolan Civil War]] (1975–2002), which lasted more than 20 years after independence from Portugal, the important [[Benguela railway]] line closed, with only the short distance of {{Convert|30|km|mi}} between Benguela and [[Lobito]] remaining operational. 
In 1983 Benguela had a population of 155,000. During the civil war the city of Benguela increased its population due to refugees from the countryside.
 
===21st century===
In the mid-2000s, with a more peaceful environment, restoration of the railway between Benguela and [[Huambo]] commenced.

While the colonial part of the city consists of relatively good-quality houses, as of 2011 most of the refugees live in slum areas.

==Transports==
The city has an airport, the [[Benguela Airport]].
The city is connected to the railway with the [[Benguela Railway]].

==Economy==
[[File:Estádio Nacional de Ombaka (19151153514) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|300px|Estádio Nacional de Ombaka.]]
Benguela was one of the centres of Portuguese trade to the African interior. The city remains an important commercial link between western and eastern Angola. [[Coffee]], [[maize|corn]], [[sisal]], [[sugarcane]], and [[tobacco]] are grown in the interior regions of Angola and widely traded in Benguela. 

[[Manganese]] from the interior is also traded in Benguela. Industries local to the city include fish processing and the milling of sugarcane. The city also produces pottery, soap, and tools.<ref name="b-lobito"/>

Foreign trade is handled through the deep-water port of [[Lobito]], which is located {{Convert|29|km|mi}} north of Benguela. Lobito, once the busiest port in Angola, was severely disrupted during the Angolan Civil War. The port has since revived and supports trade in the Benguela region.<ref name="b-lobito"/>

== Education ==
[[File:2015 Museu Nacional de Arqueologia Benguela Angola 19669386368 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Archaeological Museum.]]
The ''Universidade Katyavala Bwila and Ruvandro Ferreira'' was founded in 2009.

== Culture ==
[[File:Cine.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Teatro Monumental.]]

*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Benguela]] ([[Catholic Church]])
*[[Evangelical Congregational Church in Angola]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]])
*[[Evangelical Reformed Church in Angola]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]])
*[[Baptist Convention of Angola]] ([[Baptist World Alliance]])
*[[Universal Church of the Kingdom of God]], [[Assemblies of God]]. <ref> Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/Angola Angola], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref>
