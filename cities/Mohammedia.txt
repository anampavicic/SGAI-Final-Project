'''Mohammedia''' ({{langx|ar|المحمدية|al-muḥammadiyya}}), known until 1960 as '''Fedala''' ({{langx|ar|فضالة}}), is a port city on the west coast of [[Morocco]] between [[Casablanca]] and [[Rabat]] in the region of [[Casablanca-Settat]]. It hosts the most important oil refinery of Morocco, Samir Refinery, which makes it the center of the Moroccan petroleum industry. It has a population of 208,612 according to the [[2014 Moroccan census]].<ref name=census2014/>

==History==
=== Early history ===
[[File:ETH-BIB-Fedallah, Farm Egli, Gurbi, Übersicht-Dia 247-09235.tif|left|thumb|A farm in Fedallah in 1936.]]
[[File:Bab al kasbah Mohammedia.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The entry of the Kasbah and the Al Atik Mosque in the background]]The harbor, which is now Mohammedia, was originally named Fedala ({{lang|ar|فضالة}}). The name comes from the [[Arabic]] words ''Fadl Allah'' ({{lang|ar|فضل الله}}) which means "favor of God". According to Graberg de Hemsö, it comes from ''Fayḍ Allāh'', meaning "bounty of God".<ref>{{Citation |last=Adam |first=A. |title=Faḍāla |date=2012-04-24 |work=Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition |url=https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/fadala-SIM_2219 |access-date=2024-03-10 |publisher=Brill |language=en}}</ref> Traces still exist of its business role under the [[Almoravid dynasty]]. It was frequented in the 14th and 15th centuries by [[merchant ship]]s from Europe seeking cereals and dried fruits.

In 1773, the Sultan Sidi [[Mohammed ben Abdallah]] made of Fédala a grains warehouse of [[Tamasna]] province and built the Kasbah to protect the shops for traders. He built the white mosque Al Atik as well.

===French Protectorate===
[[File:German officers captured in French Morocco army.mil-2008-10-30-1225389725.jpg|thumb|200px|German officers captured at Fedala, 1943]]
During the precolonial period, competition between the [[Western powers]] to ensure the economical exploitation of [[Africa]] was behind the merger of Europeans interests in the ports of Morocco. In the region of Fédala, the German family Mannesmann acquired a large area of land.

The Treaty of November 4, 1911 between [[France]] and [[Germany]] on the partition of Africa forced the Mannesmann family to abandon the lands they held for Georges and Jacques Hersent, two French industrialists, who noticed the existence of a natural bay, valuable for the creation of a large port at low cost.

The group Hersent created the Franco-Moroccan company in 1912 and founded the port company in 1914 that took a leading part in the development of Fédala. The rapid growth of the city started around the port, which allowed the development of various industries such as canning fishery products, agro-industry plants, tannery, textile, etc..

The seaside town took shape in 1925 and the Esplanade was built in 1938. The construction of the sea line in 1951 made of Fédala the first and most modern oil port in North Africa.

The church of Saint James (Saint Jacques), which overlooks the main square, was erected in 1934 by Jean and Georges Hersent, in memory of their son and nephew Jacques (3 February 1893 - 26 July 1917), who died at the Marne during the [[First World War]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Histoire de la paroisse

====Battle of Fedala====
US Army invaded Fédala from the Atlantic on November 8, 1942, as part of [[operation Torch]].<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-MTO-NWA/USA-MTO-NWA-7.html The Capture of Casablanca]</ref> The invasion was carried out by the Center Attack Group of the Western Task Force which landed on the Atlantic coast of Morocco. The landing began at 4 AM.

===New city===
[[File:Mohammed V of Morocco.jpg|thumb|In 1960, the city was renamed after the reigning [[King of Morocco]], [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Mohammed V]]]]
{{Tone|section|date=March 2022}}
Fédala was renamed Mohammedia on 25 June 1960 in honor of King [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Mohammed V]], the restorer of [[History of Morocco|Moroccan independence]], on the occasion of laying the foundation stone of the Samir oil refinery. The new name indicates the modern character of this city.{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} Today, the city serves as both a seaside resort and a manufacturing center.

Mohammedia is also a resort city containing a golf and tennis club, casino and many other recreational activities. In addition, people call it {{transl|ar|madinat lwurud wa riyada}} which means "city of flowers and sports".{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Within the past decade, Mohammedia's beaches "Sablet & Mimosa" have drawn many people from Casablanca, and its nearby cities. Sablet and Mimosa have been under development, building new beach condos, villas, as well as more investments in small businesses which creates more jobs. Summer is simply the best season in Mohammedia being that there is more involvement due to an increase of the population. There is a wide range of outdoor activities including basketball, soccer, surfing, and fishing. The night life is a great experience to be part of, including several cafes, restaurants, clubs, and a boardwalk. A couple of beach residential areas that are good places for vacation are "Residence of Oubaha" and "Palm Beach." There are several other projects going on in the city of Mohammedia as well as infrastructure throughout the city.{{Citation needed|date=October 2023}}

The population of Mohammedia is growing at a fast rate. The city, which had a population of only 500 people in 1914, is currently home to about 204,000 people. The population of the prefecture of Mohammedia is estimated at 336,000 inhabitants with an average [[population density]] of {{convert|5000|PD/km2}}.
