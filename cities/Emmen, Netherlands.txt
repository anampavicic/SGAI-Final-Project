'''Emmen''' ({{IPA|nl|ˈɛmə(n)|-|Nl-Emmen.oga}}) is a [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] and town of the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[Drenthe]] in the northeastern [[Netherlands]].

== History ==
[[File:Emmen Municipality.JPG|thumb|left|Dolmen in Emmen]]
[[File:Emmen, de Grote of Pancratiuskerk RM14958 IMG 3752 2018-05-27 09.28.jpg|thumb|left|''Grote of Pancratiuskerk'']]
A [[planned city]], Emmen arose from several small farming and peat-harvesting communities which have dotted the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[Drenthe]] since the [[Middle Ages]]. Traces of these communities can still be seen in the form of the villages of [[Westenesch]], [[Noordbarge]] and [[Zuidbarge]]: they have a separate history and layout but are surrounded by the suburbs and the center of Emmen.

The expansion of the town did not happen until after the [[Second World War]]. Suburbs were built around the old center of Emmen, starting with [[Emmermeer]] directly to the north, and followed to the south-east by [[Angelslo]] (for which an old village of the same name was demolished), [[Emmerhout]] (famed at the time for being separated from the town by an existing forest) to the east, [[Bargeres]], the [[Rietlanden]] and [[Parc Sandur]] to the south and south-west. Construction of the last suburb, called [[Delftlanden]], is well underway with many homes already built and people living in the area.

There are few historic landmarks left within the town, but those few include the church on the market square, where a church has been standing since the Middle Ages, the court of law building, dating from the beginning of the twentieth century, and the post office from the same time.  In the town's environs, an earthwork by [[Robert Smithson]], "Broken Circle/Spiral Hill", may be found.

In 1957 it hosted the [[1st Women's Chess Olympiad]].

The prime economic booster since the 1980s has been the zoo, the [[Dierenpark Emmen]]. Begun in the 1930s, it was almost completely redesigned in the 1970s and is now co-owned by the municipality of Emmen. It attracts over 1.5 million visitors per year. It was replaced by [[Wildlands (zoo)|Wildlands]] in 2016, when the old zoo closed. Important industries include [[Teijin Aramid]], [[DSM Engineering Plastics]], [[Wellman, Inc.|Wellman]] and [[Diolen Industrial Fibers]] (currently [[Senbis Polymer Innovations]]). There are extensive glasshouse complexes for horticulture, especially in the [[Klazienaveen]]-[[Erica, Emmen|Erica]] area.  The municipality offers some 38,000 jobs.

Emmen is the most populous urban area of Drenthe. The municipality of Emmen is one of the largest in the [[Netherlands]], although the area outside the town borders of Emmen is rather rural. The other villages of importance are [[Emmer-Compascuum]], [[Klazienaveen]], [[Nieuw-Amsterdam, Drenthe|Nieuw-Amsterdam]],[[Zwartemeer]], [[Nieuw-Amsterdam, Netherlands|Nieuw-Amsterdam]], [[Veenoord]], [[Nieuw-Dordrecht]], [[Nieuw-Schoonebeek]], and [[Schoonebeek]].

== Demography ==
The municipality of Emmen has some 107,000 inhabitants, with 56,000 living in the city of Emmen. Compared to some 3,000 inhabitants in the nineteenth century, this illustrates Emmen's rapid growth in the past 150 years.

==Sports==
The town's [[association football|football]] club [[FC Emmen]] plays their home games in [[De Oude Meerdijk]].

Every year a big cycle racing [[criterium]] called [[Gouden Pijl]],  where all the big names in bicycle sport come to Emmen for this event. Besides the bicycle race itself, the Gouden Pijl also includes cultural events like pop-concerts, etc. In 2008, the comeback concert of [[The Schizo's]], the infamous local punk-band from the 1980s, was organized during the Gouden Pijl.

In addition, there are regular and frequent bus lines within Emmen and towards [[Groningen]], [[Hoogeveen]] and [[Assen]], as well as the surrounding countryside, and [[Meppen]] in [[Germany]], departing from Emmen's two bus terminals.

By car, the town is accessible via the [[Provincial road N34 (Netherlands)|N34]] from [[Ommen]] via [[Hardenberg]] and [[Coevorden]] towards Emmen, ending at the [[A28 motorway (Netherlands)]] towards [[Groningen]] near [[de Punt]], the [[Provincial road N381 (Netherlands)|N381]] to [[Drachten]], the [[Provincial road N391 (Netherlands)|N391]] to [[Veendam]] which goes through Emmen (with access to almost every district) and the [[A37 motorway (Netherlands)|A37]] from [[Hoogeveen]] to [[Meppen]] in [[Germany]], although this motorway is not directly next to Emmen. From the A37 to Emmen, there are three possibilities: at Junction Holsloot (A37 x N34), at Highway-exit Schoonebeek (A37 x N853), and Highway-exit Klazienaveen (A37 x N862). The A37 is also the quickest way towards the [[Randstad]] from Emmen. The A37 ends at the German border, where it continues as the [[Bundesstraße 402|B402]] or [[European route E233]].

The nearest airport is [[Groningen Airport Eelde]] at a distance of 50 kilometers.

Furthermore, there are inland shipping connections via [[Nieuw-Amsterdam, Drenthe|Nieuw-Amsterdam]] to [[Coevorden]], [[Hoogeveen]] and [[Almelo]].
