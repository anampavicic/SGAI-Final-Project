'''Muğla''' ({{IPA|tr|ˈmuːɫa|lang}}) is a city in southwestern [[Turkey]]. The city is the center of the district of [[Menteşe, Muğla|Menteşe]] and [[Muğla Province]], which stretches along Turkey's [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coast. Muğla's center is situated inland at an altitude of 660&nbsp;m and lies at a distance of about {{convert|30|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the nearest seacoast in the [[Gulf of Gökova]] to its south-west. Muğla (Menteşe) district area neighbors the district areas of [[Milas]], [[Yatağan, Muğla|Yatağan]] and [[Kavaklıdere, Muğla|Kavaklıdere]] to its north by north-west and those of [[Ula, Turkey|Ula]] and [[Köyceğiz]], all of whom are dependent districts. Muğla is the administrative capital of a province that incorporates internationally well-known and popular tourist resorts such as [[Bodrum]], [[Marmaris]], [[Datça]], [[Dalyan]], [[Fethiye]], [[Ölüdeniz]] and also the smaller resort of [[Sarigerme]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2021}}

==History==
{{Hatnote|See [[Muğla Province]] and [[Caria]] for more information on the history of the area as a whole.}}

Muğla was apparently a minor settlement in [[classical antiquity]], a halfway-point along the passage between the [[Caria]]n cities of [[Idrias]] (later [[Stratonicea (Caria)|Stratonicea]]) to the north and [[Idyma]] (modern [[Akyaka, Muğla|Akyaka]]) to the southwest on the coast. There are almost no ruins to reveal the history of the settlement of Mobolla. On the high hill to the north of the city, a few ancient remains indicate that it was the site of an [[acropolis]]. A handful of inscriptions were unearthed within the city itself and they date back to the 2nd century BC. It appears in the historical record for the first time at the beginning of the 2nd&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC under the name '''Mobolla''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Μόβωλλα}}, {{translit|grc|Móbōlla}}). At that time, the region was passing from what was apparently an eastern [[Carians|Carian]] federation linked with Taba (modern [[Tavas]]) and other cities to [[Rhodes|Rhodian]] domination. Mobolla was part of the Rhodian [[Peræa Rhodiorum|Peraea]] from at least 167&nbsp;BC until the 2nd&nbsp;century&nbsp;AD. While the region was subject to [[Rhodes]], it was not incorporated in the Rhodian state.{{cn |date=August 2024}}

In 2018, archaeologists unearthed a 2,300&nbsp;year-old rock sepulchre of an ancient Greek boxer named [[Diagoras of Rhodes]], on a hill in the Turgut village, Muğla province, [[Marmaris]]. This unusual pyramid tomb was considered to belong to a holy person by the local people. The [[shrine]], used as a [[pilgrimage]] by locals until the 1970s, also has the potential to be the only pyramid grave in [[Turkey]]. Excavation team also discovered an inscription with these words: ''“I will be vigilant at the very top so as to ensure that no coward can come and destroy this grave.”''<ref>{{Cite web |last=Smith |first=John |date=2018-05-21 |title='Shrine' in Turkey turns out to be tomb of an ancient Greek boxer |website=Greek Reporter |department=Europe |url=https://eu.greekreporter.com/2018/05/21/turkey-shrine-turns-out-to-be-tomb-of-ancient-greek-boxer/ |access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trthaber.com/haber/turkiye/yillarca-turbe-sanildi-mozole-cikti-426813.html|title=Yıllarca türbe sanıldı; mozole çıktı|website=trthaber.com|access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Shrine in Turkey uncovered as tomb of ancient Greek boxer |date=22 May 2018 |website=Neos Kosmos |language=English |url=https://neoskosmos.com/en/115755/shrine-in-turkey-uncovered-as-tomb-of-ancient-greek-boxer/ |access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Previous holy site in Turkey's Marmaris revealed to be tomb of Greek boxer |date=2018-05-21 |website=Turkish Minute |url=https://www.turkishminute.com/2018/05/21/previous-holy-site-in-turkeys-marmaris-revealed-to-be-tomb-of-greek-boxer/ |access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=2,300&nbsp;year-old shrine in Turkey turns out to be tomb of ancient Greek boxer, Diagoras |website=Greek City Times |url=https://greekcitytimes.com/2018/05/23/2300-year-old-shrine-in-turkey-turns-out-to-be-tomb-of-ancient-greek-boxer-diagoras/ |access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Archaeologists discover Aegean villagers mistook Greek boxer's tomb for Islamic holy site |website=Ahval |url=https://ahvalnews.com/archaeology/aegean-villagers-mistook-greek-boxers-tomb-islamic-holy-site-archaeologists-discover |access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref>

In 2018, archaeological ruins and mosaics discovered in the city have been confirmed to belong to the villa of the Greek fisherman Phainos, who lived in the 2nd&nbsp;century&nbsp;AD. Phainos was the richest and the most famous fisherman of his time.<ref>{{cite web |title=Villa and mosaics of Greek fisherman Phainos discovered in Turkey |website=Ahval News |url=https://ahvalnews.com/tr/node/17574}}</ref>

Under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and then [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine rule]], the town's name gradually changed to '''Mogolla''' ({{lang|grc|Μογωλᾶ}}, {{translit|grc|Mogōlâ}}) and then Mugla ({{lang|grc|Μούγλα}}, ''Moúgla''; {{langx|tr|Muğla}}). The town was one of the earliest ones conquered by the Turks in western Anatolia, being taken in the 13th&nbsp;century. It was then organized under the [[Menteşe (beylik)|Menteşe dynasty]] based at [[Milas]]. Muğla acquired regional importance after it replaced [[Milas]] as the seat of the subprovince ([[sanjak]]) under the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1420. From 1867 until 1922, Muğla was part of [[Aidin Vilayet]]. The sanjak kept the name Menteşe until the [[Republic of Turkey|Republican Era]], when it was renamed Muğla after its seat of government.{{cn |date=August 2024}}

==Geography==
The district area's physical features are determined by several pot-shaped high plains, delimited by mountains, of which the largest is the one where the city of Muğla is located and which is called under the same name (''Muğla Plain''). It is surrounded by steep slopes denuded of soil, paved with calcerous geology, and a scrub cover which gives the immediate vicinity of Muğla a barren appearance uncharacteristic of its region. Arable land is limited to valley floors.{{cn |date=August 2024}}

==Economy==
Its former profile as a predominantly rural, difficult to access, isolated and underpopulated region enclosed by a rugged mountainous complex is now coming to an end. Also in recent years, a major program of restoration of the city's architectural heritage has enhanced local tourism. The city remains an orderly, compact, and provincial agricultural center. The city which retains its old neighborhoods, not having succumbed to the mid-20th&nbsp;century boom in concrete reconstruction, but displays a progressive mind as exemplified by the pride still expressed at having had Turkey's first female provincial governor in the 1990s, [[Lale Aytaman]]. Nevertheless, Muğla still lacks sizeable manufacturing and processing centers, and its economy relies on trade, crafts, services, tourism, and agriculture. Therefore, tourism in Muğla is a great opportunity for local community employment, and its fertile soil and amenable climate provide a variety of products for people working in the agricultural sector.{{cn |date=August 2024}}

==Climate==
Muğla has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa'') or a dry-summer [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: 'wet' ''Cs'' or ''Cf''). It is characterised by long, hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters.

==Demographics==
Due to the particularity of its location, commanding a large part of Anatolia's southwestern coast and a number of busy district centers, Muğla is also notable by the large number of people who, short of being natives in the strict sense, had associations of one sort or another with the city, including among its small [[Greek people|Greek]] minority until the 1923 [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]].{{efn| {{circa|1912}} the [[Sanjak]] of Menteşe (Muğla) had a total population of 42,000, of which 1,500–4,000 were ethnic Greeks, according to varyious sources.<ref>demographic data from S. Anagiostopoulou (1997); G. Sotiriadis (1918)</ref> Most Greeks residing in the subprovince lived in the city of Muğla, totalling slightly more than 1,000 in number.<ref>{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Benedict |year=1974 |title=Ula: An Anatolian town |page=55 |isbn=978-90-04-03882-0 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]}}</ref>}} Among these can be listed:

* Arms trading tycoon [[Basil Zaharoff]], whose family were actually Greeks of the Ottomnan capital but who was born in Muğla in 1849
* The French actress of Greek descent [[Anna Mouglalis]], as attested by her name, can trace her roots to the city
* Mining and poultry magnate [[Yavuz Sıtkı Koçman]] (d.&nbsp;2002) who contributed an important part of his fortune to building the university in the 1990s

== Places of interest ==
Although it is close to major resorts, Muğla has only recently begun to attract visitors. Sights of interest in the city include:

* Great Mosque of Muğla (''Ulu Cami'') – large mosque built in 1344 by the [[Bey]]s of [[Menteşe (beylik)|Menteşe]]
* Konakaltı Han and Yağcılar Han – restored 18th&nbsp;century [[caravanserai]]s, the first used as an art gallery and facing Muğla Museum, and the second used for more commercial purposes
* ''Kurşunlu Cami''  – large mosque built in 1495
* Muğla City Museum has a good collection of archaeological and ethnographical artefacts, and 9&nbsp;million year-old animal and plant fossils, recently discovered in nearby Kaklıcatepe
* the [[Ottoman Empire]]-era bazaar (''Arasta'') – marked by a clock tower built by a [[Greek people|Greek]] craftsman named Filivari Usta in 1895
* Vakıflar [[Turkish bath|Hamam]] –  a still operating Turkish bath which dates back to 1258

The old quarter of Muğla – on the slopes and around Saburhane Square (''Meydanı''), consisting of about four hundred registered old houses dating from the 18th and 19th&nbsp;centuries, many of which are restored. These houses are mainly in the Turkish / Ottoman style, characterized by ''hayat'' ("courtyard") sections accessed through double-shuttered doors called ''kuzulu kapı'' ("lamb doors") and dotted with chimneys typical of Muğla. But there are also a number of "Greek" houses. The differences between the two types of houses may have as much to do with the extent to which wood or stone were used in their architecture, and whether they were arranged in introverted or extraverted styles, as with who inhabited them previously.

Local students tend to hang out in open air cafés along the İzmir highway, or in the caravanserai, or in ''Sanat Evi'' ("Art House") – an Ottoman-style residence that has been turned into a café / art gallery exhibiting principally wood carvings.

Muğla's political color has traditionally been center-left. In [[Turkey]]'s 2004 local elections, Dr.&nbsp;Osman Gürün ([[Republican People's Party|CHP]]) was re-elected, increasing his votes to 43.28%, aided in this by the abrupt virtual collapse of the other center-left party the [[Democratic Left Party (Turkey)|DSP]]. The 2004 elections were the seventh successive victory for the center-left candidates in the Muğla municipality. Turkey's incumbent [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] and the traditional center-right [[DYP]] have each obtained (24.5–24.75%). In 2009 communal elections, [[Nationalist Movement Party|MHP]] made a significant leap in votes and reached 24.2% of votes cast. [[Republican People's Party|CHP]] had collected almost half of the votes at 46%.{{cn |date=August 2024}}
