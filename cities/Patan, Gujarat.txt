'''Patan''' ({{audio|Patan.ogg|pronunciation}}) is the administrative seat of [[Patan district]] in the [[Indian state]] of [[Gujarat]] and is an administered [[municipality]]. It was the capital of [[Gujarat]]'s [[Chavda dynasty|Chavda]] and [[Chaulukya]] dynasties in medieval times, and is also known as '''Anhilpur-Patan''' to distinguish it from [[Prabhas Patan]]. During the rule of [[Gujarat Sultanate]], it was the capital from 1407 to 1411.

The city contains many [[Hindu]] and [[Jain]] temples as well as [[mosques]], [[dargahs]] and [[rauza]]s.

===Jain community===
Patan has been home to a community of Jains for at least several hundred years. According to a 1375 CE letter written by a Jain monk,<ref name="Cort"/>{{rp|21}}

{{poem quote|The people here participate in shining devotion, gifting, morality, and asceticism;
the mendicants are firm in upholding the blossom of equanimity;
the many Jain temples are blessed with a multitude of images;
and even in time of drought the people obtain success in religious actions by means of their merit.
The merchants here have built up a mountain of gold;
there are many playful young women with swift feet and side-glancing doe-like eyes;
gifting is given as if to a divine tree which will sing their praises;
and even those focused on ''[[moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]'' at once touch that true excellence amidst the pleasures of transmigration.

– Verses 13-14 of ''Vijñapti Mahālekha'', sent by the [[Kharatara Gaccha]] Jain mendicant Jinodayasūri from Patan to Lokahitācārya in [[Ayodhya]], in 1375 C.E.}}
