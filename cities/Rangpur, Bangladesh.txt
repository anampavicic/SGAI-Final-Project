[[File:Rangpur in letter.jpg|thumb]]
It is said that back in 1575, a trusted general of the Mughal Emperor Akbar, took over Rangpur. But it was not until 1686 that Rangpur was fully integrated into the Mughal Empire.  Back on 16 December, 1769, Rangpur was announced as a District Seat (Zila Sadar) and in 1869, it was announced as a municipality, thus making it one of the oldest municipalities in the country. ''However, [[Ghoraghat]] in Rangpur served as the one of the Mughal administrative headquarters till [[18th century]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rangpur: History within easy grasp |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/lifestyle/travelogue/news/rangpur-history-within-easy-grasp-1853566?amp |website=The Daily Star |date=September 28, 2019}}</ref> The municipal office building was erected in 1892 .

Previously serving as the headquarters of the '''Greater Rangpur''' district, The Greater Rangpur district was divided in five districts in 1984. Rangpur underwent administrative restructuring, resulting in the formation of the [[Gaibandha District|Gaibandha]], [[Kurigram District|Kurigram]], [[Lalmonirhat District|Lalmonirhat]], [[Nilphamari District|Nilphamari]], and [[Rangpur District|Rangpur]] districts.

==History==
[[File:TajhatCoatofArms.jpg|thumb|left|120px|The Coat of Arms of Maharaja Gopal Lal Roy as depicted on a ground floor French Door window panel of Tajhat Palace.]]

=== Etymology ===
It is said that the present name Rangpur came from the former 'Rongpur'. History has it, that English colonial rulers in this region started cultivating [[Indigo plant|Indigo]]. Due to the fertile soil in this region, Indigo cultivation was very much profitable. The locals knew that Indigo by the name of "Rongo". So thus, this Region was named "Rongopur".And from that, the name of today's Rangpur has originated. It is known from another conventional notion that the name Rangpur comes from the naming of Rangmahal (Palace of Entertainment) of [[Bhagadatta]], son of [[Narakasura]], king of [[Pragjyotisha Kingdom]].<ref>{{Cite web|script-title=bn:রংপুর জেলা|url=http://www.rangpur.gov.bd/site/page/7ec85f23-18fd-11e7-9461-286ed488c766/%E0%A6%9C%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0%20%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%AD%E0%A7%82%E0%A6%AE%E0%A6%BF|access-date=2021-06-16|website=Rangpur District|language=en}}</ref>

=== Early history ===
According to Hindu theology, the eastern kingdom of [[Kamarupa]] or Pragjyotisha existed in India, which included the present Rangpur region. During the reign of King [[Bhagadatta]] (15th century BC) Rangpur belonged to [[Pragjyotisha Kingdom]]. During the reign of King [[Samudragupta]] (340 AD) Rangpur was considered a "Tax state" of [[Kamarupa]].<ref name="rangpur.gov.bd">{{Cite web|script-title=bn:রংপুর জেলা|url=http://www.rangpur.gov.bd/site/page/7ec856f3-18fd-11e7-9461-286ed488c766/%E0%A6%9C%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0%20%E0%A6%90%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B9%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AF|access-date=2021-06-16|website=Rangpur District|language=en}}</ref> 

=== Mughal Period ===
According to Ain-i-Akbari, the Mughal period Rangpur consisted of three types of administrative areas. Rangpur was conquered by the army of [[Man Singh I of Amber|Raja Man Singh]], a commander of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar]], in 1575, but it was not until 1686, it was fully integrated into the Mughal Empire. The Mughal Empire was established in the whole of Rangpur in 1611 AD. Place names ''Mughalbasa'' ("a locality of the Mughals"), and ''Mughalhat'' ("local market") organized by the Mughals bear testimony to the Mughal association and past of Rangpur and its hinterland. Later, Rangpur passed into the control of Sarker of [[Ghoraghat Upazila|Ghoraghat]].<ref>{{cite Banglapedia|author=Akhter, Nasrin|article=Sarkar}}</ref>

=== British Period ===
After the [[East India Company]] gained "Deoani" in 1765, Rangpur came under British rule. The [[Fakir-Sannyasi rebellion]] took place in the Rangpur region, in which leaders like Fakir Majnu Shah played a key Role. The notable anti-colonialist rebel [[Devi Chaudhurani]]  and Bhabani Pathak were from this region.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Devi Chaudhurani--Bengal's very own Bandit Queen|url=https://www.getbengal.com/details/devi-chaudhurani-bengals-very-own-bandit-queen|access-date=2021-06-16|website=Get Bengal}}</ref> In the [[Sepoy Mutiny|Sepoy Mutiny of 1857]], the rebellious sepoys spread terror among the British rulers in the region. Later, in 1930, the first [[Salt March|Civil disobedience movement]] was started in different parts of Rangpur on the call of Congress. A meeting of the peasant leaders of North Bengal was held here in October 1946, and the [[Tebhaga movement]] began in November.<ref name="rangpur.gov.bd"/>

=== Pakistani Period and Liberation War ===
Rangpur was a District of [[East Pakistan|East Pakistan Province]] during the Pakistani Period. People of Rangpur actively take part in different movements like [[Bengali language movement]], [[Six point movement]] and [[1969 Mass uprising in East Pakistan|1969 Mass uprising]]. The first martyr from Rangpur in the liberation war was Sangku Samajhder, who was martyred on the date of 3 March 1971. Rangpur people started the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Liberation War]] decisively on 28 March 1971, only three days after the Pakistani crackdown by attacking the [[Rangpur Cantonment]]. During the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], Rangpur was under [[List of sectors in the Bangladesh Liberation War|Sector 6]] of the [[Bangladesh Forces]] and it was strategically important due to its close proximity to border of [[India]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Haq |first=Ariful |script-title=bn:ঘাঘট সেদিন রক্তে লাল হয়েছিল|url=https://1971.prothomalo.com/supplements/rural-bangla/ঘাঘট-সেদিন-রক্তে-লাল-হয়েছিল|access-date=2021-06-16|work=[[Prothom Alo]]|language=bn}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=2021-03-13|title=Liberation war began decisively on March 28 in Rangpur|url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/2021/03/13/liberation-war-began-decisively-on-march-28-in-rangpur|access-date=2021-06-16|work=[[Dhaka Tribune]]}}</ref>
