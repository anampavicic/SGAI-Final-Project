'''Monywa''' ({{MYname|MY=မုံရွာမြို့|MLCTS=muṃ rwa mrui.}}; {{IPA-my|mòʊɰ̃jwà mjo̰|pron}}) is the largest city in Sagaing Region, [[Myanmar]], located {{convert|136|km}} north-west of [[Mandalay]] on the eastern bank of the [[Chindwin River|River Chindwin]]. Monywa is one of the largest economic cities in [[Myanmar]]. It is also known as 'Neem City' because many of the city's streets are lined with [[Azadirachta indica|neem trees]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

==Climate==
Monywa and neighbouring parts of the “Dry Valley” are the only places in Southeast Asia where the [[Semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSh'') occurs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.meteotemplate.com/|title=Meteotemplate|first=Jachym|last=Brzezina|website=Meteotemplate}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.climate-data.org/asia/myanmar-151/|title=Myanmar climate: Average Temperature, weather by month, Myanmar weather averages – Climate-Data.org|website=en.climate-data.org}}</ref> The city misses the [[tropical savanna climate]] (Köppen ''Aw'') classification due to the very high temperatures and resultant high evaporation levels, alongside a long dry season. The semi-aridity has to do with the “Dry Valley” being located in the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Arakan Mountains]]. Temperatures are very high throughout the year, although the winter months from December to February are significantly milder at around {{convert|21|°C|1|disp=or}} in January. The early monsoon months from April to July are especially hot, with average high temperatures reaching {{convert|38.4|°C|°F}} in April.

Monywa received {{convert|139|mm|in|2|disp=or}} of rainfall on 19 October 2011. This was a new record for rainfall within 24 hours in October in Monywa for the last 47 years. The previous record was {{convert|135|mm|in|2|disp=or}} on 24 October 1967.<ref>http://www.mrtv3.net.mm/newpaper/2110newsm.pdf{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Page 19 Col 2</ref>

== Culture ==
Monywa is a national hub for poets, and is often described as the centre of poetry in [[Upper Myanmar]]. The town has served as home to many contemporary poets, including Min Swe Hnit, [[K Za Win]], Kyi Zaw Aye, and [[Khat Thi]].

==Transport==
[[Image:R Chindwin.JPG|thumb|left|River Chindwin at Monywa]]
Monywa is served by the Mandalay-[[Budalin]] branch [[railway]] line, but is best reached by [[bus]] as the [[road]] from Mandalay is in reasonably good shape. Monywa is linked by road to Budalin, [[Dabayin]], [[Ye-U]] and [[Kin-U]], and by rail to [[Sagaing]] and the Mandalay - [[Myitkyina]] line.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.myanmargeneva.org/02nlm/n021202.htm#Senior_General_Than_Shwe_urges_officials |title=Sr Gen Than Shwe urges officials to collectively strive for turning Sagaing Division into granary of Upper Myanmar Assistance assured to upgrade Monywa-Budalin-Dabayin-YeU-KhinU Road |publisher=[[The New Light of Myanmar]], December&nbsp;3, 2002 |access-date=2008-10-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228214721/http://www.myanmargeneva.org/02nlm/n021202.htm#Senior_General_Than_Shwe_urges_officials |archive-date=2009-02-28 }}</ref> River transport on the Chindwin has always been important as it is navigable for {{convert|640|km|mi|abbr=on}} to [[Hkamti District|Hkamti]] during the [[monsoon]] season, and most of the year to [[Homalin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/112284/Chindwin-River |title=Chindwin River |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] online |access-date=2008-10-12}}</ref> Monywa Airport also serves the area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://centreforaviation.com/data/profiles/airports/monywa-airport-nyw|title=Monywa Airport Profile &#124; CAPA|website=centreforaviation.com}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[Image:Monywa-thanboddhay-d13.jpg|thumb|left|Thanboddhay Pagoda]]
[[Image:Monywa-d04.jpg|thumb|left|Market]]
Monywa is a major centre for [[trade]] and [[commerce]] and for [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[produce]] from the surrounding Chindwin valley, especially [[beans]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[pulses]] and [[jaggery]] ([[palm sugar]]). In addition, the local [[Industry (economics)|industry]] includes mills for the production of [[cotton]], [[flour]], [[noodles]], and [[edible oil]]. [[Sausages]] from Alon called ''wet udaunk'' are quite popular, and Budalin [[longyi]] (sarong) is known for the strength of the fabric and its checked patterns. Monywa's rough cotton [[blanket]]s are famous throughout Myanmar (with Monywa providing 80% of the country's blankets for a century),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2011/news/567/news56701.html|title=In Monywa, 'market economy' leaves some businesses behind|last=Sandar Lwin|date=21 March 2011|work=Myanmar Times|access-date=23 August 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916201502/http://mmtimes.com/2011/news/567/news56701.html|archive-date=16 September 2011}}</ref> and some can even be found sewn up into [[knapsack]]s sold to unsuspecting tourists in [[Bangkok]]. Other regional crafts include [[bamboo]] and [[Phragmites|reed]] products, [[Cattle|bullock]] carts and [[tools|agricultural implements]]. The village of Kyaukka is well known for its [[lacquerware]] utensils for everyday use.

[[Black market]] goods from [[India]], especially [[sari]]s and [[bicycle]] parts, pass through Monywa on their way to other parts of Myanmar.

==Attractions==
[[File:Monywa Signboard.jpg|thumb|Entrance to Monywa]]
The major [[tourist]] attraction in Monywa is [[Thambuddhe Pagoda]] <!--''Mohnyin Thambuddhei Paya''-->, a [[Buddhist]] temple with a huge [[stupa]] resembling [[Indonesia]]'s [[Borobudur]]. It dates from 1303, although it was reconstructed in 1939. It is said to contain over 500,000 images of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. Close by is the [[Maha Bodhi Tahtaung]] [[Laykyun Sekkya]] standing Buddha statue, the 3rd tallest statue in the world, at 115.82 metres (a total of 129.23 metres, including the pedestal). This is the focal point of a sprawling site filled with Buddha statues, bodhi trees, and pagodas, established by the [[Maha Bodhi Ta Htaung Sayadaw]] in the 1960s. It includes also a 95-metre long [[reclining Buddha]] statue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nevworldwonders.com/2011/11/10-wonder-bodi-tataung-standing-buddha.html|title=Nev World Wonders|access-date=2011-12-29|archive-date=2015-09-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918182803/http://www.nevworldwonders.com/2011/11/10-wonder-bodi-tataung-standing-buddha.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Another attraction is the [[Phowintaung]] cave complex across the Chindwin River, approximately {{convert|25|km|mi}} west of Monywa.

'''Nyaung-gan Bronze Age cemetery''', dated to between 1,500 BCE and 500 BCE, in Budalin with bronze tools, ceramics and stone artifacts is 60 minutes travel on a narrow road north of Monywa.<ref>[https://frontiermyanmar.net/en/once-feted-by-myanmars-junta-bronze-age-cemetery-site-returns-to-the-spotlight Once feted by Myanmar's junta, Bronze Age cemetery site returns to the spotlight], Forntier Myanmar.</ref>

Very few tourists visit Monywa as its facilities are limited.
