'''Barquisimeto''' ({{IPA|es|baɾkisiˈmeto}}; {{langx|guc|Watkisimeeta}}) is a city in [[Venezuela]]. Barquisimeto is located in the [[Central-Western Region, Venezuela]]. It is the capital of the state of [[Lara (state)|Lara]] and head of [[Iribarren Municipality]]. It is an important urban, industrial, commercial and transportation center of the country, recognized as the fourth-largest city by population and area in Venezuela after [[Caracas]], [[Maracaibo]] and [[Valencia, Venezuela|Valencia]].

== History ==
{{Unsourced|section|date=August 2022}}
[[File:Jacinto Lara.jpg|thumb|170px|left|[[Jacinto Lara|Jacinto Lara General]]]]
Barquisimeto was founded in 1552 by Juan de Villegas, as a headquarters and to have better control of the territory believed to be rich in gold. Its original name was '''Nueva Segovia de Barquisimeto''' and then it was shortened to just Barquisimeto.

This city changed locations four times between 1552 and 1563. The original settlement was near the Buría River, but moved in 1556 due to frequent floods suffered by inhabitants. The second location was in the valley of the Turbio River, where the city stayed until [[Lope de Aguirre]] burned it down in 1561. The city was rebuilt {{convert|102|km|0|abbr=on}}, but in 1562 they inhabitants asked for permission to move to another site due to strong winds blowing in the place. Finally, Barquisimeto was located on the north plateau of the Turbio River in 1563.

During the country's independence, Barquisimeto joined the liberation movement and its deputy José Ángel Álamo signed the Independence Act on July 5, 1811.

In 1929, the city went through a modernization program carried out by General Juan Vicente Gomez. He fixed the streets and avenues and buildings were built, like the [[Jacinto Lara]] Headquarters, the Government Palace and the Ayacucho Park.

=== Names and etymology ===
According to the German adventurer [[Nikolaus Federmann]], the [[Caquetío]] aborigines used to call it Variquicimeto, which translates as "ash-colored river", the name with which the natives distinguished the water stream near the city. This river was named "Turbio River" by the Spanish conquerors, a name that is still in use today. Another possible name origin is due to a red dye called ''bariquí''.

When Juan de Villegas founded it, he named the city "Nueva Segovia de Barquisimeto", but years later it became just "Barquisimeto", a word popularized by Oviedo y Baños in his book ''History and Conquest of the Venezuelan Population''.

== Religion ==
{{Unsourced|section|date=August 2022}}
The city's modern [[Cathedral of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, Barquisimeto|Cathedral of Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] is the cathedral of the episcopal see of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Barquisimeto]].

=== Divina Pastora ===
[[File:Procesionpastora.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Procession of the Divina Pastora]]
[[File:Santa Iglesia Catedral Metropolitana, Catedral de Barquisimeto.jpg|thumbnail|240px|[[Barquisimeto Cathedral]]]]
The [[Divina Pastora (Barquisimeto)|Divina Pastora]] (Divine Shepherdess) is a statue of the Virgin Mary holding the infant Jesus, with a lamb at her side. It is considered to be one of the most important religious icons of Venezuela. Divina Pastora is the patron saint of the city of Barquisimeto and of the Venezuelan National Militia. The original image dates from 1735. Divina Pastora is celebrated in a procession on January 14 of each year, when a massive Marian procession occurs, considered to be one of the largest in the world, attracting thousands of pilgrims.

The statue is removed from its shrine and is carried on the main streets of Barquisimeto in a procession which starts at the Iglesia de la Divina Pastora in Santa Rosa until it reaches the Barquisimeto Cathedral. This procession is unlike other mass Marian celebrations in the world, where the image does not leave its temple. This procession occurs due to the devotion the people of Barquisimeto have towards it as gratitude towards saving the city from a cholera outbreak that occurred in the city in the 19th century. In 2013, 3,000,000 faithful honored the Divina Pastora.

== Transportation ==
The [[Transbarca]] system is a new "[[bus rapid transit]]" (BRT) system under construction, which was originally planned to use [[trolleybus]]es.  When construction began, in 2006, the system was projected to serve an average of 170,000 people per day when completed, using 80 trolleybuses operating along {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} of exclusive lanes, across the metropolitan area. Service was planned to include an express route of {{convert|22|km|mi|abbr=on}} along with one local route of {{convert|8|km|mi|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}. With 52 stations, the BRT system is to include  a centralized system of communication and security, and structures for easy access for elderly and disabled people. It is to be complemented with feeder routes, covering the areas of Greater Barquisimeto the BRT line will not serve, which will connect with the main line at terminal stations.

Although 80 [[articulated bus|articulated]] trolleybuses were purchased from [[Neoplan]] and delivered around 2008–09,<ref name=tm306>''Trolleybus Magazine'' No. 306 (November–December 2012), p. 148.</ref> the plans to operate the Transbarca system with those vehicles were dropped in 2013.<ref name=tm311-p138>''Trolleybus Magazine'' No. 311 (September–October 2013), p. 138.</ref> In addition to reasons of cost, an inadequate supply of electricity with which to power the system was cited in the announcement of the decision.<ref name=el-impulso2013>{{cite news|last=Pérez Terán|first=Daniel|title=Ministro El Troudi: Transbarca debe estar terminado el 14-S|trans-title=Minister El Troudi: Transbarca must be completed on 14-S (14 September)|newspaper=[[El Impulso (Venezuela)|El Impulso]]|date=5 July 2013|language=es|url=http://elimpulso.com/articulo/ministro-el-troudi-transbarca-debe-estar-terminado-el-14-s-fotos|access-date=9 August 2015}}</ref>
