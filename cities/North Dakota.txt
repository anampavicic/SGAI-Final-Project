'''North Dakota''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|audio=en-us-North Dakota.ogg|d|ə|ˈ|k|oʊ|t|ə}} {{respell|də|KOH|tə}})<ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|North Dakota|accessdate=2024-03-08}}</ref> is a landlocked [[U.S. state]] in the [[Upper Midwest]], named after the indigenous [[Dakota people|Dakota]] [[Sioux]]. It is bordered by the Canadian provinces of [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]] to the north and by the U.S. states of [[Minnesota]] to the east, [[South Dakota]] to the south, and [[Montana]] to the west. North Dakota is part of the [[Great Plains]] region, characterized by broad [[prairie]]s, [[steppe]], temperate [[savanna]], [[badlands]], and farmland. North Dakota is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|19th-largest state]], but with a population of less than 780,000, it is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|fourth-least populous]] and [[List of U.S. states by population density|fourth-most sparsely populated]].<ref group="note">[[2020 United States census|As of 2020 United States Census]].</ref> The [[List of capitals in the United States|state capital]] is [[Bismarck, North Dakota|Bismarck]] while the [[List of cities in North Dakota|most populous city]] is [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]], which accounts for nearly a fifth of the state's population; both cities are among the fastest-growing in the U.S., although half of all residents live in rural areas.

What is now North Dakota was inhabited for thousands of years by various [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes, including the [[Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation|Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara]] along the [[Missouri River]]; the [[Ojibwe]] and [[Cree]] in the northeast; and several Sioux groups (the [[Assiniboine|Nakota]], [[Dakota people|Dakota]], and [[Lakota people|Lakota]]) across the rest of the state. European explorers and traders first arrived in the early 18th century, mostly in pursuit of lucrative furs.

The United States acquired the region in the early 19th century, gradually settling it amid [[American Indian Wars|growing resistance]] by increasingly displaced natives. The [[Dakota Territory]], established in 1861, became central to [[American pioneer]]s, with the [[Homestead Act of 1862]] precipitating significant population growth and development. The traditional fur trade declined in favor of farming, particularly of wheat. The subsequent Dakota Boom from 1878 to 1886 saw giant farms stretched across the rolling prairies, with the territory becoming a regional economic power. The [[Northern Pacific Railway|Northern Pacific]] and [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern]] railway companies competed for access to lucrative grain centers; farmers banded together in political and socioeconomic alliances that were core to the broader [[Populist movement (United States, 19th Century)|Populist Movement]] of the Midwest. North and South Dakota were [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] on November 2, 1889, as the 39th and 40th states. President [[Benjamin Harrison]] shuffled the statehood papers before signing them so that no one could tell which became a state first; consequently, the two states are officially numbered in alphabetical order.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mark|last=Stein|author-link=Mark Stein (author)|title=How the States Got Their Shapes|publisher=Smithsonian Books/Harper Collins|date=2008|page=256|isbn=978-0061431395}}</ref> Statehood marked the gradual winding-down of the pioneer period, with the state fully settled by around 1920.<ref>{{Cite web|title=North Dakota - History|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/North-Dakota|access-date=August 14, 2021|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|archive-date=June 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210625135100/https://www.britannica.com/place/North-Dakota|url-status=live}}</ref> Subsequent decades saw a rise in radical agrarian movements and economic cooperatives, of which one legacy is the [[Bank of North Dakota]], the only state-run bank in the U.S.

Beginning in the mid-20th century, North Dakota's rich [[natural resource]]s became more critical to economic development; into the 21st century, [[Extraction of petroleum|oil extraction]] from the [[Bakken formation]] in the northwest has played a [[North Dakota oil boom|major role]] in the state's prosperity. Such development has led to population growth (along with high birth rates) and reduced unemployment. It ranks relatively well in metrics such as infrastructure, [[quality of life]], economic opportunity, and public safety. It is believed to host the geographic center of North America, [[Rugby, North Dakota|Rugby]], and is home to what was once the tallest artificial structure in the [[Western Hemisphere]], the [[KVLY-TV]] [[KVLY-TV mast|mast]].

==History==
{{Main|History of North Dakota}}

===Pre-colonial history===

Native American people lived in what is now North Dakota for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans. The known tribes included the [[Mandan people]] (from around the 11th century),<ref name="auto">Wood, W. Raymond and Thomas D. Thiessen: ''Early Fur Trade On The Northern Plains. Canadian Traders Among the Mandan and Hidatsa Indians, 1738–1818.'' Norman and London, 1987, p. 5.</ref> while the first [[Hidatsa]] group arrived a few hundred years later.<ref>Ahler, Stanley A., T. D. Thiessen and M. K. Trimble: ''People of the Willows. The Prehistory and Early History of the Hidatsa Indians''. Grand Forks, 1991., p. 38.</ref> They both assembled in villages on tributaries of the Missouri River in what would become west-central North Dakota. [[Crow Nation|Crow Indians]] traveled the plains from the west to visit and trade with the related Hidatsas<ref name="auto"/> after the split between them, probably in the 17th century.<ref>Wood, W. Raymond: Notes on the Crow-Hidatsa Schism. ''Plains Anthropologist'', Vol. 22 (1977), pp. 83–100, p. 86.</ref>

Later came divisions of the [[Sioux]]: the [[Lakota people|Lakota]], the [[Dakota people|Santee]] and the [[Assiniboine|Yanktonai]]. The [[Assiniboine]] and the [[Plains Cree people|Plains Cree]] undertook southward journeys to the village Indians, either for trade or for war.<ref name="auto" /><ref>Milloy, John S.: ''The Plains Cree. Trade, Diplomacy and War, 1790–1870''. Winnipeg, 1988, pp. 47–66.</ref> The [[Shoshone|Shoshone Indians]] in present-day Wyoming and Montana may have carried out attacks on Indian enemies as far east as the Missouri.<ref>Wood, W. Raymond: The Earliest Map of the Mandan Heartland: Notes on the Jarvis and Mackay 1791 Map. ''Plains Anthropologist''. Vol. 55, No. 216 (Nov. 2010), pp. 255–276, p. 266.</ref> A group of [[Cheyenne]]s lived in a village of earth lodges at the lower [[Sheyenne River]] ([[Biesterfeldt Site]]) for decades in the 18th century.

Due to attacks by Crees, Assiniboines and [[Ojibwe|Chippewas]] armed with firearms{{clarify|date=July 2021}}, they left the area around 1780 and crossed Missouri some time after.<ref>Hyde, George E.: ''Life of George Bent. Written From His Letters''. Norman, 1987. pp. 9–15.</ref> A band of the few [[Cheyenne|Sotaio Indians]] lived east of Missouri River and met the uprooted Cheyennes before the end of the century. They soon followed the Cheyennes across Missouri and lived among them south of [[Cannonball River]].<ref>Wood, W. Raymond: The Earliest Map of the Mandan Heartland: Notes on the Jarvis and Mackay 1791 Map. ''Plains Anthropologist''. Vol. 55, No. 216 (Nov. 2010), pp. 255–276, p. 272.</ref>

Eventually, the Cheyenne and the Sutaio became one tribe and turned into mounted buffalo hunters with ranges mainly outside North Dakota. Before the middle of the 19th century, the [[Arikara]] entered the future state from the south and joined the Mandan and Hidatsa.<ref>Meyer, Roy W.: ''The Village Indians of Upper Missouri. The Mandans, Hidatsas, and Arikaras''. Lincoln and London, 1977, p. 90.</ref> With time, a number of Indians entered into treaties with the United States. Many of the treaties defined the territory of a specific tribe.

===European exploration and colonization===

The first European to reach the area was the [[French-Canadian]] trader [[Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La Vérendrye|Pierre Gaultier, sieur de La Vérendrye]], who led an exploration and trading party to the [[Mandan]] villages in 1738 guided by Assiniboine Indians.<ref name="atlas of canada">{{cite web | title = Audio Transcript of Pierre Gaultier de La Vérendrye 1738 | publisher = The Atlas of Canada | year = 2003 | url = http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/historical/exploration/1738_verendrye.mov/view | access-date = August 19, 2007 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013180956/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/historical/exploration/1738_verendrye.mov/view | archive-date = October 13, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>
 
From 1762 to 1802, the region formed part of [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spanish Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349302/Louisiana-Purchase|title= Louisiana Purchase—History, Facts, & Map|website= Britannica.com|access-date= September 4, 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150501010249/https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349302/Louisiana-Purchase|archive-date= May 1, 2015|url-status= live}}</ref>

===Settlement and statehood===

European Americans settled in Dakota Territory only sparsely until the late 19th century, when railroads opened up the region. With the advantage of grants of land, they vigorously marketed their properties, extolling the region as ideal for agriculture.

Differences between the northern and southern part caused resentments between the settlers. The northern part was seen by the more populated southern part as somewhat disreputable, "too much controlled by the wild folks, cattle ranchers, fur traders" and too frequently the site of conflict with the indigenous population. The northern part was generally content with remaining a territory. However, following the territorial capital being moved from [[Yankton, South Dakota|Yankton]] in the southern part to Bismarck, the southern part began to call for division. Finally, at the 1887 territorial election, the voters approved splitting the territory into two. The division was done by the seventh standard parallel.<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Now You Know: Why Are There Two Dakotas? |url=https://time.com/4377423/dakota-north-south-history-two/ |access-date=April 7, 2022 |magazine=Time |language=en |archive-date=April 8, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220408084549/https://time.com/4377423/dakota-north-south-history-two/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-10-17 |title=Moving Toward Statehood {{!}} North Dakota Studies |url=http://www.ndstudies.gov/content/moving-toward-statehood |access-date=April 7, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017234846/http://www.ndstudies.gov/content/moving-toward-statehood |archive-date=October 17, 2015 }}</ref>

Congress passed an omnibus bill for statehood for North Dakota, [[South Dakota]], [[Montana]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], titled the [[Enabling Act of 1889]], on February 22, 1889, during the administration of President [[Grover Cleveland]]. His successor, [[Benjamin Harrison]], signed the proclamations formally admitting North Dakota and South Dakota to the Union on November 2, 1889.<ref name="washington">{{cite web | title = Enabling Act | publisher= Washington State Legislature | url = http://www.leg.wa.gov/History/State/enabling.htm | access-date = August 19, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070919230052/http://www.leg.wa.gov/History/State/enabling.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> | archive-date = September 19, 2007}}</ref>

The rivalry between the two new states presented a dilemma of which was to be admitted first. Harrison directed Secretary of State [[James G. Blaine]] to shuffle the papers and obscure from him which he was signing first. The actual order went unrecorded, thus no one knows which of the Dakotas was admitted first.<ref name="using">{{cite web | title=H.I.P.

===20th and 21st centuries===

Unrest among wheat farmers, especially among Norwegian [[immigrants]], led to a populist political movement centered in the [[Non Partisan League]] ("NPL") around the time of [[World War I]]. The NPL ran candidates on the Republican ticket (but merged into the [[North Dakota Democratic-Nonpartisan League Party|Democratic Party]] after [[World War II]]). It tried to insulate North Dakota from the power of out-of-state banks and corporations.

In addition to founding the state-owned [[Bank of North Dakota]] and [[North Dakota Mill and Elevator]] (both still in existence), the NPL established a state-owned railroad line (later sold to the [[Soo Line Railroad]]). Anti-corporate laws virtually prohibited a corporation or bank from owning title to land zoned as farmland. These laws, still in force today, after having been upheld by state and federal courts, make it almost impossible to foreclose on farmland, as even after foreclosure, the property title cannot be held by a bank or mortgage company.<ref name="state-law">{{cite web |url= http://www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t10c06-1.pdf |title= CHAPTER 10-06.1 Corporate or Limited Liability Company Farming |publisher= State of North Dakota |access-date= December 29, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161222063532/http://www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t10c06-1.pdf |archive-date= December 22, 2016 |url-status= live }}</ref> Furthermore, the Bank of North Dakota, having powers similar to a Federal Reserve branch bank, exercised its power to limit the issuance of subprime mortgages and their collateralization in the form of derivative instruments, and so prevented a collapse of housing prices within the state in the wake of 2008's financial crisis.<ref name="state bank">{{cite journal |url= https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2009/03/how-nation%E2%80%99s-only-state-owned-bank-became-envy-wall-street |title= How the Nation's Only State-Owned Bank Became the Envy of Wall Street |journal= [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |last= Harkinson |first= Josh |date= March 27, 2009 |access-date= December 29, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161230085936/http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2009/03/how-nation%E2%80%99s-only-state-owned-bank-became-envy-wall-street |archive-date= December 30, 2016 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

For decades, North Dakota's annual murder and violent crime rates were regularly the lowest in the United States. In recent years, however, while still below the national average, crime has risen sharply. In 2016, the violent crime rate was three times higher than in 2004, with the rise occurring mostly in the late 2000s, coinciding with the oil boom era. This happened at a time when the national violent crime rate declined slightly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm|title=United States Crime Rates 1960—2016|first=Christopher|last=Effgen|website=www.disastercenter.com|access-date=December 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701112104/http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm|archive-date=July 1, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Workers in the oil boom towns have been blamed for much of the increase.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thinkprogress.org/crime-in-north-dakotas-oil-boom-towns-is-so-bad-that-the-fbi-is-stepping-in-76e3203eab24/|title=Crime In North Dakota's Oil Boom Towns Is So Bad That The FBI Is Stepping In|website=[[ThinkProgress]]|date=March 6, 2015 |access-date=December 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205143614/https://thinkprogress.org/crime-in-north-dakotas-oil-boom-towns-is-so-bad-that-the-fbi-is-stepping-in-76e3203eab24/|archive-date=December 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/ndcrimn.htm|title=North Dakota Crime Rates 1960—2016|first=Christopher|last=Effgen|website=www.disastercenter.com|access-date=December 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205143609/http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/ndcrimn.htm|archive-date=December 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

{{See also|Geology of North Dakota}}
North Dakota is located in the [[Upper Midwest]] region of the United States. It lies at the center of the [[North American continent]] and borders [[Canada]] to the north. The geographic center of North America is near the town of [[Rugby, North Dakota|Rugby]]. [[Bismarck, North Dakota|Bismarck]] is the capital of North Dakota, and [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]] is the most populous city.
[[File:Western North Dakota.JPG|thumb|left|View of western North Dakota]]
North Dakota is in the U.S. region known as the [[Great Plains]]. The state shares the [[Red River of the North]] with [[Minnesota]] to the east. [[South Dakota]] is to the south, [[Montana]] is to the west, and the Canadian provinces of [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]] are to the north. North Dakota is near the middle of [[North America]] with a stone marker in [[Rugby, North Dakota]] marking the "Geographic Center of the North American Continent".

The western half of the state consists of the hilly [[Great Plains]] as well as the northern part of the [[Badlands]], which are to the west of the [[Missouri River]]. The state's high point, [[White Butte (North Dakota)|White Butte]] at {{convert|3506|ft|m|0|sp=us}}, and [[Theodore Roosevelt National Park]]<ref>{{cite web| title = Theodore Roosevelt National Park Virtual Tour| publisher = The Real North Dakota Project| year = 2007| url = http://www.realnd.com/badlandsindex.htm| access-date = August 17, 2007| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070925025734/http://www.realnd.com/badlandsindex.htm| archive-date = September 25, 2007| df = mdy-all}}</ref> are in the Badlands. The region is abundant in [[fossil fuel]]s including [[natural gas]], [[petroleum|crude oil]] and [[lignite]] coal. The [[Missouri River]] forms [[Lake Sakakawea]], the third largest artificial lake in the United States, behind the [[Garrison Dam]].<ref>{{cite web| title = History of Lake Sakakawea State Park| publisher=North Dakota Parks & Recreation Department| year = 2003| url = http://www.ndparks.com/Parks/Sakakawea/history.htm | access-date = August 17, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928061913/http://www.ndparks.com/Parks/Sakakawea/history.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = September 28, 2007}}</ref>

The central region of the state is divided into the [[Drift Prairie]] and the [[Missouri Plateau]]. The eastern part of the state consists of the flat [[Red River Valley]], the bottom of glacial [[Lake Agassiz]]. Its fertile soil, drained by the meandering [[Red River of the North|Red River]] flowing northward into [[Lake Winnipeg]], supports a large agriculture industry.<ref>{{cite web| title = A Glacier, A Lake, A Valley and Soil for the Future| publisher = University of Minnesota| year = 1979| url = http://mbbnet.umn.edu/hoff/hoff_agassiz.html| access-date = August 17, 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070811093735/http://mbbnet.umn.edu/hoff/hoff_agassiz.html| archive-date = August 11, 2007| url-status = live}}</ref> [[Devils Lake (North Dakota)|Devils Lake]], the largest natural lake in the state, is also found in the east.<ref name="50states">{{cite web| title = North Dakota Facts and Trivia| publisher = 50States.com| year = 2007| url = http://www.50states.com/facts/ndakota.htm| access-date = August 17, 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070711121322/http://www.50states.com/facts/ndakota.htm| archive-date = July 11, 2007| url-status = dead}}</ref>

Most of the state is covered in [[grassland]]; crops cover most of eastern North Dakota but become increasingly sparse in the center and farther west. Natural trees in North Dakota are found usually where there is good drainage, such as the ravines and valley near the [[Pembina Gorge State Recreation Area|Pembina Gorge]] and [[Killdeer Mountains]], the [[Turtle Mountain (plateau)|Turtle Mountains]], the hills around Devils Lake, in the dunes area of McHenry County in central North Dakota, and along the Sheyenne Valley slopes and the Sheyenne delta. This diverse terrain supports nearly 2,000 species of plants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ashipunov.info/shipunov/fnddb/index.htm|title=Flora of North Dakota: Checklist|website=ashipunov.info|access-date=September 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924052523/http://ashipunov.info/shipunov/fnddb/index.htm|archive-date=September 24, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Flora of North Dakota Illustrated Checklist |url=http://ashipunov.info/shipunov/fnddb/shipunov20190220_flora_of_north_dakota_illustrated_checklist.pdf |website=Ashipunov.info}}</ref>

Soil is North Dakota's most precious resource. It is the base of the state's great agricultural wealth. North Dakota also has enormous mineral resources. These mineral resources include billions of tons of lignite coal. In addition, North Dakota has large oil reserves. [[Petroleum]] was discovered in the state in 1951 and quickly became one of North Dakota's most valuable mineral resources. In the early 2000s, the emergence of hydraulic fracturing technologies enabled mining companies to extract huge amounts of oil from the Bakken shale rock formation in the western part of the state.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bakken Oil Boom, North Dakota, USA |url=https://eros.usgs.gov/media-gallery/earthshot/bakken-oil-boom-north-dakota-usa |website=USGS}}</ref>

===Climate===

{{main|Climate of North Dakota}}
[[File:North Dakota Köppen.svg|thumb|390px|upright=1.25|Köppen climate types of North Dakota|left]]

North Dakota has a [[continental climate]] with warm summers and cold winters. The temperature differences are significant because of its far inland position and being roughly equal distance from the North Pole and the Equator.

Throughout the mid-19th century, Dakota Territory was still dominated by Native Americans; warfare and disease reduced their population at the same time Europeans and Americans were settling in the area. Throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century and into the early twentieth century, North Dakota, along with most of the Midwest U.S., experienced a mass influx of newcomers from both the eastern United States and immigrants from Europe. North Dakota was a known popular destination for immigrant farmers and general laborers and their families, mostly from [[Norway]], [[Iceland]], [[Sweden]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Much of this settlement gravitated throughout the western side of the [[Red River Valley]], as was similarly seen in South Dakota and in a parallel manner in Minnesota. This area is well known for its fertile lands. By the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]], this was among North America's richest farming regions. But a period of higher rainfall ended, and many migrants were not successful in the arid conditions. Many family plots were too small to farm successfully.

From the 1930s until the end of the 20th century, North Dakota's population gradually declined, interrupted by a couple of brief increases. Young adults with university degrees were particularly likely to leave the state. With the advancing process of mechanization of agricultural practices, and environmental conditions requiring larger landholdings for successful agriculture, subsistence farming proved to be too risky for families. Many people moved to urban areas for jobs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Leading Population Trends in North Dakota |publisher=North Dakota State University |year=2007 |url=http://www.ndsu.edu/sdc/data/populationtrends.htm |access-date=August 19, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818144416/http://www.ndsu.edu/sdc/data/populationtrends.htm |archive-date=August 18, 2007 }}</ref>

Since the late 20th century, one of the major causes of migration from North Dakota is the lack of skilled jobs for college graduates. Expansion of economic development programs has been urged to create skilled and high-tech jobs, but the effectiveness of such programs has been open to debate.<ref>{{cite news | title = Agenda 2003—Saving North Dakota | newspaper = The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead | year = 2002 | url = http://www.in-forum.com/specials/savingnd/index2.cfm?page=articles_inside&id=27390 | access-date = August 19, 2007 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204321/http://www.in-forum.com/specials/savingnd/index2.cfm?page=articles_inside&id=27390 | archive-date = September 27, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> During the first decade of the 21st century, the population increased in large part because of jobs in the oil industry related to development of [[Unconventional (oil & gas) reservoir|unconventional]] [[tight oil]] (shale oil) fields.<ref>[http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_22258851/oil-boom-turbocharges-north-dakota-population-growth "Oil boom turbocharges North Dakota population growth"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120114748/http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_22258851/oil-boom-turbocharges-north-dakota-population-growth |date=January 20, 2013 }}, ''The Denver Post'', Retrieved on July 12, 2013.</ref> Elsewhere, the Native American population has increased as some reservations have attracted people back from urban areas.

Corn yields are high in the southeast part of the state and smaller in other parts of the state. Most of the cereal grains are grown for livestock [[Fodder|feed]].
The state is the leading producer of many oilseeds, including 92% of the U.S. [[canola]] crop, 94% of [[flax]] seed, 53% of [[sunflower seed]]s, 18% of [[safflower]] seeds, and 62% of [[mustard seed]]. Canola is suited to the cold winters and it matures fast. Processing of canola for oil production produces canola meal as a by-product. The by-product is a high-protein animal feed.

[[Soybeans]] are also an increasingly important crop, with {{convert|400000|acre|km2}} additional planted between 2002 and 2007.<ref name="usda facts" /> Soybeans are a major crop in the eastern part of the state, and cultivation is common in the southeast part of the state.

The [[energy industry]] is a major contributor to the economy. North Dakota has both coal and oil reserves. On average, the state's production of oil production grew at average annual rate of 48.4% from 2009 to 2018. During these years, oil production increased each year from 2009 to 2015, with 2016 marked by a slight decline and a return to growth since.<ref name=":1" /> [[Shale gas]] is also produced. [[Lignite coal]] reserves in Western North Dakota are used to generate about 90% of the electricity consumed, and electricity is also exported to nearby states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/solar.renewables/page/state_profiles/north_dakota.html|title=EIA Renewable Energy-North Dakota Renewable Profile|date=May 27, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527040437/http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/solar.renewables/page/state_profiles/north_dakota.html|archive-date=May 27, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> North Dakota has the second largest lignite coal production in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web | website=National Mining Association | title=Coal Statistics | date=May 15, 2011 | url=http://www.nma.org/statistics/coal.asp | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515065127/http://www.nma.org/statistics/coal.asp | archive-date=May 15, 2011 | url-status=dead | access-date=November 15, 2018|df=mdy-all}}</ref> However, lignite coal is the lowest grade coal.

===Tourism===
North Dakota is considered the least visited state, owing, in part, to its not having a major tourist attraction.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lukas |first=Paul |url=https://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/moneymag_archive/1999/11/01/268029/index.htm |title=State Secret North Dakota, our least visited state, is also among the most underappreciated |work=CNNMoney.com |date=November 1, 1999 |access-date=July 13, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122133737/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/moneymag_archive/1999/11/01/268029/index.htm |archive-date=January 22, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> 
Nonetheless, tourism is North Dakota's third largest industry, contributing more than $3 billion into the state's economy annually.

===Native American First Nations===

[[File:Kane Métis Buffalo Hunt.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Paul Kane]] witnessed and participated in the annual [[bison hunting|bison hunt]] of the [[Métis people (United States)|Métis]] in June 1846 on the prairies in Dakota.]]

In the 21st century, North Dakota has an increasing population of Native Americans, who in 2010 made up 5.44% of the population. By the early 19th century the territory was dominated by Siouan-speaking peoples, whose territory stretched west from the Great Lakes area. The word "Dakota" is a Sioux (Lakota/Dakota) word meaning "allies" or "friends".

The primary historic tribal nations in or around North Dakota, are the Lakota and the Dakota ("[[The Great Sioux Nation]]" or "Oceti Sakowin", meaning the seven council fires), the [[Blackfoot]], the [[Cheyenne]], the [[Chippewa]] (known as [[Ojibwe]] in Canada), and the [[Mandan]]. There are six [[Indian reservation]]s in North Dakota--[[Spirit Lake Tribe]], [[Standing Rock Indian Reservation]], [[Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate]], [[Fort Berthold Indian Reservation]], [[Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation]], and [[Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation|The Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation]].

===Pow wows===

Social gatherings known as "[[powwows]]" (or wacipis in Lakota/Dakota) continue to be an important part of Native American culture and are held regularly throughout the state. Throughout Native American history, powwows were held, usually in the spring, to rejoice at the beginning of new life and the end of the winter cold. These events brought Native American tribes together for singing and dancing and allowed them to meet with old friends and acquaintances, as well as to make new ones. Many powwows also held religious significance for some tribes. Today, powwows are still a part of the Native American culture and are attended by Natives and non-Natives alike. In North Dakota, the United Tribes International Powwow held each September in the capital of [[Bismarck, North Dakota|Bismarck]], is one of the largest powwows in the United States.

A [[pow wow]] is an occasion for parades and Native American dancers in regalia, with many dancing styles presented. It is traditional for male dancers to wear regalia decorated with beads, quills, and eagle feathers; male [[grass dance]]rs wear colorful fringe regalia, and male [[fancy dance]]rs wear brightly colored feathers. Female dancers dance much more subtly than male dancers. Fancy female dancers wear cloth, beaded moccasins, and jewelry, while the [[jingle dress]] dancer wears a dress made of metal cones. Inter-tribal dances during the powwow, allow everyone (even spectators) to take part in the dancing.

===Norwegian and Icelandic influences===

[[File:Hultstrand61.jpg|thumb|Norwegian settlers in front of their sod house in North Dakota in 1898]]

Around 1870 many European immigrants from Norway settled in North Dakota's northeastern corner, especially near the Red River. [[Icelandic American|Icelanders]] also arrived from Canada.<ref>William Charles Sherman, Playford V. Thorson, Warren A. Henke, ''Plains Folk: North Dakota's Ethnic History'' (North Dakota Institute for Regional Studies, 1986) pp 189, 242, 256</ref> [[Pembina, North Dakota|Pembina]] was a town of many [[Norwegian American|Norwegians]] when it was founded; they worked on family farms. They started Lutheran churches and schools, greatly outnumbering other denominations in the area. This group has unique foods such as ''[[lefse]]'' and ''[[lutefisk]]''. The continent's largest Scandinavian event, ''[[Norsk Høstfest]]'', is celebrated each September in [[Minot, North Dakota|Minot's]] [[North Dakota State Fair Center]], a local attraction featuring art, architecture, and cultural artifacts from all five Nordic countries. The Icelandic State Park in [[Pembina County, North Dakota|Pembina County]] and an annual Icelandic festival reflect immigrants from that country, who are also descended from Scandinavians.

Old World folk customs have persisted for decades in North Dakota, with the revival of techniques in weaving, silver crafting, and wood carving. Traditional turf-roof houses are displayed in parks; this style originated in Iceland. A [[stave church]] is a landmark in Minot. [[Norwegian-Americans]] constitute nearly one-third or 32.3% of Minot's total population and 30.8% of North Dakota's total population.

===Germans from Russia===

{{See also|Germans from Russia}}

Ethnic Germans who had settled in Russia for several generations since the reign of [[Catherine the Great]] grew dissatisfied in the nineteenth century because of economic problems and because of the revocation of religious freedoms for [[Russian Mennonite|Mennonites]] and [[Hutterite]]s, in particular the revocation of exemption from military service in 1871. Most Mennonites and Hutterites migrated to America in the late 1870s. By 1900, about 100,000 had immigrated to the U.S., settling primarily in North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, and Nebraska. The south-central part of North Dakota became known as "the German-Russian triangle". By 1910, about 60,000 ethnic Germans from Russia lived in Central North Dakota. These individuals were Lutherans, Mennonites, Hutterites and Roman Catholics who had kept most of their German customs of the time when their ancestors immigrated to Russia. They were committed to agriculture. Traditional iron cemetery grave markers are a famous art form practiced by ethnic Germans.<ref>Elwyn B. Robinson, ''History of North Dakota'' (1966) pp. 285–87, 557</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.ndsu.edu/grhc/articles/newspapers/news/gilmour3.html |title=Germans from Russia Heritage Collection |publisher=Library.ndsu.edu |date=September 1, 2002 |access-date=September 13, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218092351/http://library.ndsu.edu/grhc/articles/newspapers/news/gilmour3.html |archive-date=December 18, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Fine and performing arts===

North Dakota's major [[fine art]] museums and venues include the [[Chester Fritz Auditorium]], [[Empire Arts Center]], the [[Fargo Theatre]], [[North Dakota Museum of Art]], and the [[Plains Art Museum]]. The [[Bismarck-Mandan Symphony Orchestra]], [[Fargo-Moorhead Symphony Orchestra]], [[Greater Grand Forks Symphony Orchestra]], [[Minot Symphony Orchestra]] and Great Plains Harmony Chorus are full-time professional and semi-professional musical ensembles who perform concerts and offer educational programs to their communities.

===Entertainment===

The major political parties in North Dakota are the [[North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party|Democratic-NPL]] and the [[North Dakota Republican Party|Republican Party]]. {{As of|2007}}, the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]] and the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] are also organized parties in the state.

At the state level, the [[Governor of North Dakota|governorship]] has been held by the Republican Party since 1992, along with a majority of the state legislature and statewide officers. Dem-NPL showings were strong in the 2000 governor's race, and in the 2006 legislative elections, but the League has not had a major breakthrough since the administration of former state governor [[George Sinner]].

The Republican Party presidential candidate usually carries the state by a considerable margin; in [[2020 United States presidential election in North Dakota|2020]], [[Donald Trump]] won over 65% of the vote. Of all the Democratic presidential candidates since 1892, only [[Grover Cleveland]] (1892, one of three votes), [[Woodrow Wilson]] (1912 and 1916), [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (1932 and 1936), and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (1964) received [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] votes from North Dakota.

On the other hand, Dem-NPL candidates for North Dakota's federal Senate and House seats won every election between 1982 and 2008, and the state's federal delegation was entirely Democratic from 1987 to 2011. However, both of the current U.S. senators, [[John Hoeven]] and [[Kevin Cramer]], are Republicans, as is the sole House member, [[Kelly Armstrong]].

A [[Heartbeat bill|six-week abortion ban is active]] in North Dakota. Despite this, a [[Plurality voting|simple majority]] of the state's citizens oppose the legislation.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Carvell |first=Tasha |title=Abortion ban opposed by majority of likely North Dakota voters, new poll finds |url=https://kfgo.com/2023/11/14/928213/ |access-date=2023-11-28 |website=The Mighty 790 KFGO {{!}} KFGO |language=en}}</ref>
