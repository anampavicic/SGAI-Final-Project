'''Dordrecht''' ({{IPA|nl|ˈdɔrdrɛxt|lang|311 Dordrecht.ogg}}), historically known in English as '''Dordt''' (still colloquially used in Dutch, {{IPA|nl|dɔrt|pron|nl-Dordt.ogg}}) or '''Dort''', is a [[List of cities in the Netherlands by province|city]] and [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] in the Western [[Netherlands]], located in the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[South Holland]]. It is the province's fifth-largest city after [[Rotterdam]], [[The Hague]], [[Leiden]], and [[Zoetermeer]], with a population of {{formatnum:{{Dutch municipality population|Dordrecht}}}}.

The municipality covers the entire Dordrecht Island, also often called ''Het Eiland van Dordt'' ("the Island of Dordt"), bordered by the rivers [[Oude Maas]], [[Beneden Merwede]], [[Nieuwe Merwede]], [[Hollands Diep]], and [[Dordtsche Kil]]. Dordrecht is the largest and most important city in the [[Drechtsteden]] and is also part of the [[Randstad]], the main [[conurbation]] in the Netherlands.

Dordrecht is the oldest city in [[Holland]] and has a rich history and culture.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Gem-Dordrecht-OpenTopo.jpg|thumb|Dordrecht Island]]
[[File:RMSDeltaNorth.jpg|thumb|right|Island of Dordrecht (7) in the [[Rhine-Meuse delta]]]]
The name Dordrecht comes from ''Thuredriht'' (circa 1120), ''Thuredrecht'' (circa 1200). The name seems to mean 'thoroughfare'; a ship-canal or river through which ships were pulled by rope from one river to another, as here between the Dubbel and the Merwede. Earlier etymologists had assumed that the 'drecht' suffix came from Latin 'trajectum', a ford, but this was rejected in 1996.<ref>W. van Osta, 'Drecht en drecht-namen', ''Naamkunde'' 28, 1-2 (Leuven 1996) 51-77</ref> The Drecht is now supposed to have been derived from '{{lang|nl|draeg}}', which means to pull, tow or drag. Inhabitants of Dordrecht are ''Dordtenaren'' (singular: ''Dordtenaar'').

Dordrecht is informally called ''Dordt'' by its inhabitants. In earlier centuries, Dordrecht was a major trading port and was called Dort in English.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dordrecht {{!}} Netherlands {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Dordrecht |access-date=2023-03-24 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref>

== History ==
{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2021}}

=== Early history ===
The city was formed along the [[Thure river]], in the midst of peat marshes. This river was a branch of the river Dubbel, which is part of the massive [[Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta]] complex, near the current [[Beguinage|Bagijnhof]]. Around 1120 reference to Dordrecht was made by a remark that count [[Dirk IV of Holland]] was murdered in 1049 near "''Thuredrech''".{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}
[[File:View of Dordrecht, by Aelbert Cuyp.jpg|thumb|200px|left|View of Dordrecht, by [[Aelbert Cuyp]]]]
Dordrecht was granted [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] by [[William I, Count of Holland]], in 1220, making it the oldest city in the present province of [[South Holland]]. In fact, [[Geertruidenberg]] was the first city in the historical county of [[Holland]] to receive city rights, but this municipality currently is part of the province of [[North Brabant]].

In the 12th and 13th centuries, Dordrecht developed into an important market city because of its strategic location. It traded primarily in [[wine]], [[wood]] and [[cereals]]. Dordrecht was made even more important when it was given [[staple right]] in 1299.

In 1253 a [[Latin school]] was founded in Dordrecht. It still exists today as the {{Interlanguage link multi|Johan de Witt Gymnasium|nl|3=Johan de Witt-gymnasium}} and is the oldest [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in the Netherlands. From 1600 to 1615 [[Gerhard Johann Vossius]] was [[Rector (academia)|rector]] at this school.

On 18–19 November 1421, the [[St. Elizabeth's flood (1421)|Saint Elisabeth's flood]] flooded large parts of southern Holland, causing Dordrecht to become an island. It was commonly said that over 10,000 people died in the flood, but recent research indicates that it was probably fewer than 200 people.<ref>J. Hendriks, 'De watersnoodrampen van 1421 en 1424', in: H. van Duinen en C. Esseboom, ''Verdronken dorpen boven water. Sint Elisabethsvloed 1421; geschiedenis en archeologie'' (Dordrecht [2007]) 125</ref>

On 29 June 1457, the city was devastated by a fire which started in Kleine Spuistraat, destroying many buildings, including the Grote Kerk.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=De Grote of Onze Lieve Vrouwekerk te Dordrecht |url=https://journals.open.tudelft.nl/knob/article/view/StadesVischer14 |language=nl-NL |journal=Bulletin KNOB |access-date=2020-12-03 |archive-date=2021-01-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210121185831/https://journals.open.tudelft.nl/knob/article/view/StadesVischer14 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Building |url=https://grotekerkdordrecht.com/en/stories/building/ |access-date=2020-12-03 |website=Vrienden van de Grote Kerk Dordrecht |language=en-US |archive-date=2020-10-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031194603/https://grotekerkdordrecht.com/en/stories/building/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=9 May 2017 |title=De brand duurde vijf dagen |url=https://www.ad.nl/dordrecht/de-brand-duurde-vijf-dagen~abdda1b4/ |url-status=live |access-date=4 September 2021 |website=[[Algemeen Dagblad]] |language=nl |archive-date=5 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210805233349/https://www.ad.nl/dordrecht/de-brand-duurde-vijf-dagen~abdda1b4/ }}</ref>

=== Union of Dordrecht ===
[[File:Dordrecht vanDeventer.jpg|thumb|right|Dordrecht around 1565, by Jacob van Deventer]]In 1572, four years into the [[Dutch Revolt]], representatives of all the cities of Holland, with the exception of [[Amsterdam]], as well as the [[Watergeuzen]], represented by [[William II de la Marck]], gathered in Dordrecht to hold the ''Eerste Vrije Statenvergadering'' ("First Assembly of the Free [[States of Holland and West Friesland|States]]"), also known as the ''Unie van Dordrecht'' ("Union of Dordrecht"). This secret meeting, called by the city of Dordrecht, was a rebellious act since only [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II]] or his [[stadtholder]], at that time the [[Duke of Alba]], were allowed to call a meeting of the [[States of Holland]].

During the meeting, the organization and financing of the rebellion against the Spanish occupation was discussed, Phillip II was unanimously denounced, and [[William the Silent|William of Orange]] was chosen as the rightful [[stadtholder]] and recognized as the official leader of the revolt. Orange, represented at the meeting by his assistant [[Philips of Marnix, Lord of Saint-Aldegonde|Philips of Marnix]], was promised financial support of his struggle against the Spanish and at his own request, [[freedom of religion]] was declared in all of Holland.

The gathering is regarded as the first important step towards the free and independent [[Dutch Republic]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cms.dordrecht.nl/dordt?waxtrapp=htvrnDsHaKnPvBJWH |title=Gemeente Dordrecht - Gemeente Dordrecht |work=dordrecht.nl |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217151032/http://cms.dordrecht.nl/dordt?waxtrapp=htvrnDsHaKnPvBJWH |archive-date=2008-12-17}}</ref> Other important gatherings such as the [[Union of Brussels]] (1577) and the [[Union of Utrecht]] (1579) paved the way for official independence of the [[Dutch Republic]], declared in the [[Act of Abjuration]] in 1581.

The Union of Dordrecht was held in an Augustinian monastery, nowadays simply called ''het Hof'' ("the Court"). The room in which the meeting was held is called ''de Statenzaal'' ("The Hall of States") and features a [[stained glass]] window in which the coats of arms of the twelve cities that were present at the meeting can be seen.

=== Synod of Dordrecht ===
{{Main|Synod of Dort}}

[[File:J.W. de Jongh en M. Wagenvoort - Eene vergadering van de Nationale Synode te Dordrecht 1619 - Schoolplaat J.B. Wolters.jpg|thumb|The [[Synod of Dordrecht|synod]] of 1618/19]]

From 13 November 1618 to 9 May 1619, an important [[Reformed tradition|Dutch Reformed Church]] assembly took place in Dordrecht, referred to as the [[Synod of Dordrecht]].<ref name="Synod of Dort">{{cite encyclopedia |title = Synod of Dort |url = https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/169656/Synod-of-Dort |encyclopedia=Britannica Online Encyclopædia |publisher=Britannica Online |access-date=8 April 2013 |archive-date=6 June 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130606103654/https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/169656/Synod-of-Dort |url-status=live }}</ref> The synod attempted, and succeeded, to settle the theological differences of opinion between the central tenets of [[Calvinism]], and a new school of thought within the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] known as [[Arminianism]], named for its spiritual leader [[Jacobus Arminius]]. Arminius' followers were also commonly known as [[Remonstrants]], after the 1610 [[Five Articles of Remonstrance]] which outlined their points of dissent from the church's official doctrine. They were opposed by the Contra-Remonstrants, or the Gomarists, who were led by Dutch theologian [[Franciscus Gomarus]].

During the [[Twelve Years' Truce]], this in essence purely theological conflict between different factions of the church had in practice spilled over into politics, dividing society along ideological lines, and threatening the existence of the young republic by repeatedly bringing it to the brink of civil war.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.kerkindordt.nl/naslag/geschiedenis/797-synode-van-dordrecht |title=Synode van Dordrecht - Kerk in Dordt |work=kerkindordt.nl |access-date=9 November 2021 |archive-date=16 November 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181116015723/http://www.kerkindordt.nl/naslag/geschiedenis/797-synode-van-dordrecht |url-status=live }}</ref>

The synod was attended by Gomarist Dutch delegates and also by delegates from Reformed churches in Germany, Switzerland, and England. Though it was originally intended that the synod would bring agreement on the doctrine of predestination among all the Reformed churches, in practice this Dutch synod was mainly concerned with problems facing the [[Dutch Reformed Church]].

The opening sessions dealt with a new Dutch translation of the Bible, a catechism, and the censorship of books. The synod then called upon representatives of the Remonstrants to express their beliefs. The Remonstrants refused to accept the rules established by the synod and eventually were expelled from the church.

The synod then studied the theology of the Remonstrants and declared that it was contrary to Scripture. The [[Canons of Dort]] were produced; they discussed in detail in five sections the errors of the Remonstrants that were rejected as well as the doctrines that were affirmed. The doctrines affirmed were that predestination is not conditional on belief; that Christ did not die for all; the total depravity of man; the irresistible grace of God; and the impossibility of falling from grace. These canons of Dort, along with the Belgic Confession and the Heidelberg Catechism, remain the theological basis of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands.

Following the synod, two hundred Remonstrant ministers were deposed from their office, of which eighty were banished. The political leaders of the Remonstrant movement were arrested and one of them beheaded on May 14, 1619.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vandergugten |first1=S. |title=The Arminian Controversy and the Synod of Dort |url=http://spindleworks.com/library/vandergugten/arminian_c.htm |access-date=30 April 2016 |date=1989 |archive-date=19 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419145920/http://spindleworks.com/library/vandergugten/arminian_c.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> It was only after the death of Prince Maurice in 1625 that the persecution of the Remonstrants ceased.<ref>{{cite web |title=Remonstrants |url=http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc09/htm/iv.vii.cliii.htm |website=Christian Classics Ethereal Library |access-date=30 April 2016 |date=2004 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304093059/http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc09/htm/iv.vii.cliii.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Diminishing economic importance ===
During the [[Eighty Years' War]] merchants from Dordrecht were involved in taking control and founding [[sugar cane]] plantations in the West Indies. At the end of the 17th century this led to a stable [[sugar refinery|sugar refining]] industry in Dordrecht. This flourished in the 18th century, when Dordrecht had 16 sugar refineries, as opposed 120 in Amsterdam and 40 in Rotterdam. Dordrecht still has a few buildings purposely designed as a sugar refinery, e.g. the imposing [[Sugar Refinery Stokholm]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sigmond|first1=Kees |last2=De Meer |first2=Sjoerd|title=Een zoete belofte Suikernijverheid in Dordrecht (17de-19de eeuw) |url=https://www.oud-dordrecht.nl/jaarboek-2012-een-zoete-belofte |year=2013 |publisher=Historische Vereniging Oud-Dordrecht}}</ref> 

Overall, the economic importance of Dordrecht began to wane in the 18th century, and [[Rotterdam]] became the main city in the region.

=== The Patriots movement ===
From 1780 to 1787, Dordrecht was home to the [[Patriots (Dutch Republic)|Patriots]] faction which intended to remove the hereditary [[Stadtholder]] position held by the [[House of Orange-Nassau]].

The Netherlands was after all a republic ''[[de jure]]''. Soon after, more cities followed and [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]] fled from Holland. But his brother-in-law, King [[Frederick William II of Prussia]], came to the aid of William V and on 18 September 1787, Dordrecht capitulated to Prussian troops. The Patriots were defeated and Willem V was restored in his position as Stadtholder.

=== In the Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815–2023) ===
[[File:Launch of Kayo Maru in Dordrech 1865.jpg|thumb|The [[Japanese frigate Kaiyō Maru]] was launched at Dordrecht in 1865. She was the largest wooden warship ever launched from a Dutch yard]]
[[File:S. Lankhout 1858 Map of Dordrecht.jpg|thumb|1858 map of Dordrecht]]
During the [[French period]] (1795–1813) Dordrecht continued to have a decent sea harbor and, for ocean-going ships, it was easier to reach than Rotterdam harbor. This changed in 1829, when the [[Voorne Canal]] was opened. Meanwhile, profits from the trade with the [[Dutch East Indies]] probably obscured the fact that Dordrecht was losing the maritime competition with Rotterdam. The end of Dordrecht as a first rate sea harbor came about when the [[Nieuwe Waterweg]] became fully usable in 1883.<ref name="Koopmans">{{cite book |last=Koopmans|first=Carolien |title=Dordrecht 1811–1914: een eeuw demografische en economische geschiedenis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0Wt0aqq1-IC |year=1992 |publisher=Verloren, Hilversum|isbn=9065504052 }}</ref> Compared to Dordrecht, Rotterdam sent about four times as much cargo up the Rhine to Germany in 1875. In 1895 this was 30 times as much and in 1910 about 200 times. In absolute numbers cargo from Dordrecht declined by more than 50%.<ref name="Koopmans" />

In the early 19th century, Dordrecht was a major center for shipbuilding. It was also a center of the Dutch timber market. As a smaller town, wages were lower than in Amsterdam and Rotterdam. It all made that many shipping lines that sailed to the East Indies for the [[Netherlands Trading Society]] (NTS) had their ships built in Dordrecht. Shipbuilders and shipping lines from Dordrecht profited disproportionally from the NTS policies. From about 1850 to 1876, the NTS gradually stopped its protection of Dutch shipping.<ref name="Koopmans" />

The traditional (cane) sugar refining industry of Dordrecht would not survive the industrial revolution. However, in 1861 [[Dordrecht Sugar Factory]] became operational as second modern [[beet sugar factory]] of the Netherlands.

Throughout the centuries, Dordrecht held a key position in the defense of Holland. It hosted an army division well into the 20th century. During the [[mobilization]] of August 1939, infantry and artillery were sent to Dordrecht to defend the island. When the Germans invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940, German paratroopers landed in Dordrecht. After fierce fighting they took the bridges Dordrecht-Moerdijk and Dordrecht-Zwijndrecht. Many buildings in Dordrecht were destroyed. Towards the end of the [[Second World War]], during the winter of 1944–45, Dordrecht and its surroundings were in the middle between the opposing armies. The border between occupied and liberated regions ran along the [[Hollands Diep]]. Dordrecht was finally liberated by the Canadian Army.

In 1970, the municipality [[Dubbeldam]] (then ca. 10,000 inhabitants) and the southern part of the municipality of [[Sliedrecht]] were incorporated into Dordrecht, making Dordrecht Island one municipality.

=== Folklore ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
During [[Carnival|Carnaval]], Dordrecht is called ''Ooi- en Ramsgat'' (Ewe's and Ram's hole), and its inhabitants are ''Schapenkoppen'' (Sheepheads). This name originates from an old folk story. Import of meat or cattle was taxed in the 17th century. To avoid having to pay, two men dressed up a sheep they had bought outside the city walls, attempting to disguise it as a man. The sheep was discovered because it bleated as the three men (two men and one sheep) passed through the city wall gate. There is a special monument of a man and his son trying to hold a sheep disguised as a man between them, that refers to this legend. The logo of Dordrecht's professional football club [[FC Dordrecht]] includes the head of a ram and its supporters are known to sing ''Wij zijn de Dordtse schapenkoppen'' (we are the Dordtse sheep heads) during matches. There is also a cookie called ''Schapenkop'' (sheep head) which is a speciality of Dordrecht.

There are many more legends about Dordrecht. One of them is about Saint Sura, a young woman who planned on building an entire church with only three coins in her purse. She was murdered because of her supposed wealth.

Another legend is about the house called ''de Onbeschaamde'' (the Unembarrassed). It is about the three brothers Van Beveren who each wanted to build a house and decided to make a bet on who would dare to place the most risqué statue on their façade. One of the brothers, Abraham van Beveren, placed a naked little boy on his façade. However, the house that supposedly won has an empty façade today because, according to the story, the statue was so risqué that it was removed.

A well known saying about Dordrecht is ''Hoe dichter bij Dordt, hoe rotter het wordt'' (the closer to Dordrecht, the more rotten it gets). The previous mayor Noorland added to that; ''maar ben je er eenmaal in, dan heb je het prima naar je zin'' (but once you're in it, you're perfectly content). The saying can probably be explained as follows; traffic used to go by water and whoever came close to Dordrecht was obliged, according to [[staple right]], to display their merchandise for a couple of days before being allowed to sail on. This caused loss of time and caused products to become rotten. Another explanation is derived from ''[[Zaltbommel|Bommel]] is rommel, bij [[Tiel]] is niet viel en hoe dichter bij Dordt hoe rotter het wordt'' which is supposed to be said by farmers describing the bad quality of the land close to the rivers [[Meuse (river)|Maas]] and [[Waal (river)|Waal]], only suitable for harvesting [[Reed bed|reed]].

=== Nature ===
[[File:Postcard - 1901 - Merwepark, Dordrecht, Netherlands.jpg|thumb|Postcard from Dordrecht in 1901, showing the former building in Merwepark before its destruction by bombardment in 1944]]
The Sliedrechtse Biesbosch, east of Dordrecht, and the Dordtse Biesbosch, south of Dordrecht, together form the Hollandse Biesbosch which is a part of the national park the [[Biesbosch]], one of the largest national parks in the Netherlands and one of the last freshwater tide areas in Europe. The Dordtse Biesbosch has several recreational areas that are used for [[walking]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] and [[Human swimming|swimming]].

There are also several parks near the city, such as Merwepark and Wantijpark.

=== Sports ===
The [[Riwal Hoogwerkers Stadion]] is a football stadium and home ground of the local team [[FC Dordrecht]] playing in the second national league.

=== Dordts ===
Dordts is a dialect of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] traditionally spoken by the working class of Dordrecht. It is categorized under the [[Hollandic]] accents but also has characteristics of [[Zeelandic]] and [[Brabantian dialect|Brabantian]].

Typical features of Dordts are:
*Using the [[diminutive]] [[suffix]] ''-ie'' or ''-tie'' in cases where standard Dutch uses ''-je''. (e.g. Standard Dutch: {{lang|nl|appeltje}} ("little apple") Dordts: {{lang|nl|appeltie}})
*Words borrowed from Brabantian such as ''akkerdere'' ("lit. to knock or to fit, fig. "to get along")
*The Dutch [[diphthongs]] ''ei'' and ''ui'' tend to be pronounced more like ''èè'' and ''öö''. Recently, the ''ei''-sound has started to be pronounced more like ''ai''.

In the 20th century, Dordts has slowly started to disappear as more and more people have started speaking [[standard Dutch]]. The strongest Dordts dialect is nowadays found in the working-class neighborhoods bordering the city centre.

=== Other ===
On 14 November 1992 and again on 12 November 2011, the official arrival of the popular legendary figure [[Sinterklaas]] was held in Dordrecht and broadcast on national television.

== Economy ==
[[File:Zeehavengebied Dordrecht.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Harbor area of Dordrecht, seen from the Leeuwenhoekweg]]
The current economy of Dordrecht is based on ship building, wood industry, and steel industry. The city has the sixth largest sea port in the Netherlands. One of the largest employers on Dordrecht Island is [[DuPont|DuPont de Nemours (Nederland) B.V.]] It has 9 factories here with a workforce of 900 people.

In development are the "Learning" and "Health" Business Parks. The Learning Park is intended to have {{cvt|60000|m²|0}} of space for educational institutions. In the Health Park, a wide range of health services will be located, with the Dordwijk Campus of the Albert Schweitzer Hospital as focal point. Other services include a blood bank, pharmacy, and mental health clinic.

Near the Health Park a new Sport Park will be built. A new large sport centre, the equivalent size of 3 soccer fields, is planned complete with gyms, skating rink, and a pool. Next to this Sport Park, a huge outdoor event terrain will be established.

=== Shopping ===
Shopping in the centre of Dordrecht is centred around the Voorstraat, the Sarisgang and the Statenplein (Staten square). The Voorstraat is {{cvt|1200|m|yd}} long, making it the longest shopping street in the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youropi.com/nl/dordrecht/article/winkelen-in-dordrecht-764 |title=Leuke straten in Dordrecht - Winkelen Dordrecht - Informatie over winkelen in Dordrecht |publisher=Youropi.com |access-date=2013-03-26 |archive-date=2013-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627151625/http://www.youropi.com/nl/dordrecht/article/winkelen-in-dordrecht-764 |url-status=live }}</ref> Markets are held every Friday and Saturday on the Statenplein and in the Sarisgang and on Tuesday in Dubbeldam.
