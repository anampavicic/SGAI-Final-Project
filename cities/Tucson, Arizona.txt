Tucson was founded as a military fort by the Spanish when [[Hugo Oconór|Hugo O'Conor]] authorized the construction of [[Presidio San Agustín del Tucsón]] in 1775.

The Spanish name of the city, {{Lang|es|Tucsón}} ({{IPA|es|tuɣˈson}}), is derived from the [[Oʼodham language|O'odham]] {{Lang|ood|Cuk Ṣon}} ({{IPA|ood|tʃʊk ʂɔːn}}). {{Lang|ood|Cuk}} is a stative verb meaning "(be) black, (be) dark". {{Lang|ood|Ṣon}} is (in this usage) a noun referring to the base or foundation of something.<ref name="Saxton-1983" /> The name is commonly translated into English as "the base [of the hill] is black", a reference to a basalt-covered hill now known as [[Sentinel Peak (Arizona)|Sentinel Peak]]. Tucson is sometimes referred to as the Old [[Pueblo]] and Optics Valley, the latter referring to its optical science and telescopes known worldwide.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.aztechcouncil.org/optics-valley-arizona/ | title=AZ Optics Valley Optics & Photonics Networking Association }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.destguides.com/united-states/arizona/tucson/tucson-nicknames|date=September 12, 2023|author=Audrey Wilson|title=6 Tucson Nicknames and the History Behind Them}}</ref>

The Tucson area was probably first visited by [[Paleo-Indians]], who were known to have been in southern Arizona about 12,000 years ago. Recent archaeological excavations near the [[Santa Cruz River (Arizona)|Santa Cruz River]] found a village site dating from 2100 BC.<ref name="Thiel">{{cite news|last1=Thiel|first1=J.

These people hunted, gathered wild plants and nuts, and ate corn, beans, and other crops grown using irrigation canals they constructed.<ref name="Thiel"/>

The Early Ceramic period occupation of Tucson had the first extensive use of pottery vessels for cooking and storage. The groups designated as the [[Hohokam]] lived in the area from AD 600 to 1450 and are known for their vast irrigation canal systems and their red-on-brown pottery.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Hohokam|url=http://arizonamuseumofnaturalhistory.org/plan-a-visit/mesa-grande/the-hohokam|website=Arizona Museum of Natural History|access-date=October 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003225824/http://arizonamuseumofnaturalhistory.org/plan-a-visit/mesa-grande/the-hohokam|archive-date=October 3, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Mabry|first1=Jonathan B.|last2=Thiel|first2=J.

Italian [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary [[Eusebio Francisco Kino]] first visited the Santa Cruz River valley in 1692. He founded the [[Mission San Xavier del Bac]] in 1700, about {{convert|7|mi|0|abbr=on}} upstream from the site of the settlement of Tucson. A separate Convento settlement was founded downstream along the Santa Cruz River, near the base of what is now known as [[Sentinel Peak (Arizona)|"A" mountain]]. [[Hugo Oconór]] (Hugo O'Conor), the founding father of the city of Tucson, Arizona, authorized the construction of a military fort in that location, ''[[Presidio San Augustin del Tucson|Presidio San Agustín del Tucsón]],'' on August 20, 1775 (the present downtown [[Pima County Courthouse]] was built near this site). During the Spanish period of the presidio, attacks such as the [[Second Battle of Tucson]] were repeatedly mounted by the [[Apache]]. Eventually, the town came to be called ''Tucsón,'' a Spanish version of the O'odham word for the area. It was included in the state of Sonora after Mexico gained independence from the [[Kingdom of Spain]] and its [[Spanish Empire]] in 1821.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rana |first=Rajesh Kumar |title=History of Tucson, Arizona: From Spanish Colonial Rule to Modern Times |url=https://www.travelerlifes.com/2023/06/history-of-tucson-arizona.html |access-date=July 3, 2023 |website=Traveler Lifes |language=en}}</ref>

During the [[Mexican–American War]] in 1846–1848, Tucsón was [[capture of Tucson (1846)|captured]] by [[Philip St. George Cooke]] with the [[Mormon Battalion]], but it soon returned to Mexican control as Cooke proceeded to the west, establishing [[Cooke's Wagon Road]] to California. Tucsón was not included in the [[Mexican Cession]] to the United States following the war. Cooke's road through Tucsón became one of the important routes into California during the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1849.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The US acquired those portions of modern-day Arizona that lay south of the [[Gila River]] by treaty from Mexico in the [[Gadsden Purchase]] on June 8, 1854. Under this treaty and purchase, Tucsón became a part of the United States of America. The American military did not formally take over control until March 1856. In time, the name of the town became standardized in English in its current form, where the stress is on the first syllable, the "u" is long, and the "c" is silent.

In 1857, Tucson was established as a stage station on the [[San Antonio–San Diego Mail Line]]. In 1858, it became third division headquarters of the [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] and operated until the line was shut down in March 1861. The [[San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line|Overland Mail Corporation]] attempted to continue running, but following the [[Bascom Affair]], devastating Apache attacks on the stations and coaches ended operations in August 1861.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Tucson was incorporated in 1877, making it the oldest incorporated city in Arizona.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

From 1877 to 1878, the area suffered a rash of [[stagecoach]] robberies. Most notable were the two holdups committed by masked road agent [[William Brazelton|William Whitney Brazelton]].<ref name="Wright-2010">{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Erik J.|title="Yes, Here I am Again!

Brazelton|journal=Wild West History Association: Journal|volume=3|issue=5|date=October 2010|pages=43–48}}</ref> Brazelton held up two stages in the summer of 1878 near Point of Mountain Station, about {{convert|17|mi|km|abbr=on}} northwest of Tucson. [[John Clum]], of [[Tombstone, Arizona]], fame, was one of the passengers. Pima County Sheriff [[Charles A. Shibell]] and his citizen posse killed Brazelton on August 19, 1878, in a [[mesquite]] [[bosque]] along the Santa Cruz River {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} south of Tucson. Brazelton had been suspected of highway robbery in the Tucson area, the [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]] region, and the [[Silver City, New Mexico]] area. Because of the crimes and threats to his business, [[John J. Valentine Sr.]] of [[Wells, Fargo & Co.]] had sent [[Robert H.

===Post-frontier life===
As other settlers tried to overcome violent frontier society, in 1885, the territorial legislature founded the [[University of Arizona]] as a [[Land-grant university|land-grant college]] on what was overgrazed ranchland between Tucson and Fort Lowell.

During the territorial and early statehood periods, Tucson was Arizona's largest city and commercial center, while Phoenix was the seat of state government (beginning in 1889) and agriculture. The development of [[Davis–Monthan Air Force Base|Tucson Municipal Airport]] increased the city's prominence. Between 1910 and 1920, though, Phoenix surpassed Tucson in population, and has continued to outpace Tucson in growth. In recent years, both Tucson and Phoenix have had some of the highest growth rates of any jurisdiction in the United States.

Similar to many other cities in the Western US, Tucson was developed by European Americans on a [[grid plan]] starting in the late 19th century, with the city center at Stone Avenue and Broadway Boulevard. While this intersection was initially near the [[Centroid|geographic center]] of Tucson, the center has shifted as the city has expanded far to the east. Development to the west was effectively blocked by the Tucson Mountains. Covering a large geographic area, Tucson has many distinct neighborhoods.

Tucson's earliest neighborhoods, some of which were redeveloped and covered by the [[Tucson Convention Center]] (TCC), include:

As one of the oldest parts of town, Central Tucson is anchored by the Broadway Village shopping center, designed by local architect [[Josias Joesler]] at the intersection of Broadway Boulevard and Country Club Road. The 4th Avenue Shopping District between downtown, the university, and the Lost Barrio just east of downtown, also has many unique and popular stores. Local retail business in Central Tucson is densely concentrated along Fourth Avenue and the Main Gate Square on University Boulevard near the UA campus. [[El Con Mall]] is also in the eastern part of midtown.

====Northern Tucson====
North Tucson includes the urban neighborhoods of Amphitheater and [[Flowing Wells, Arizona|Flowing Wells]]. Usually considered the area north of Fort Lowell Road, North Tucson includes some of Tucson's primary commercial zones ([[Tucson Mall]] and the Oracle Road Corridor). Many of the city's most upscale [[boutiques]], restaurants, and art galleries are also on the north side, including St. Philip's Plaza. The plaza is directly adjacent to the historic [[St. Philip's in the Hills Episcopal Church]] (built in 1936).

The north side also is home to the suburban community of [[Catalina Foothills, Arizona|Catalina Foothills]], in the foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains just north of the city limits. This community includes many of the area's most expensive homes, sometimes multimillion-dollar estates. The Foothills area is generally defined as north of River Road, east of Oracle Road<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tucson.com/news/local/street-smarts-how-oracle-road-came-to-be-named-for/article_f3bf19c2-e2b0-5192-92c6-f7dabe3204a0.html|title=Street Smarts: How Oracle Road came to be named for a fast ship with a teetotaling crew|author=David Leighton|newspaper=Arizona Daily Star|access-date=July 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707230849/https://tucson.com/news/local/street-smarts-how-oracle-road-came-to-be-named-for/article_f3bf19c2-e2b0-5192-92c6-f7dabe3204a0.html|archive-date=July 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> and west of [[Sabino Canyon|Sabino Creek]]. Some of the Tucson area's major resorts are in the Catalina Foothills, including [[Hacienda Del Sol Guest Ranch Resort|Hacienda Del Sol]], Westin La Paloma Resort, Loews Ventana Canyon Resort and [[Canyon Ranch|Canyon Ranch Resort]]. [[La Encantada (shopping center)|La Encantada]], an outdoor shopping mall, is also in the Foothills.

The [[DeGrazia Gallery in the Sun Historic District|DeGrazia Gallery of the Sun]] is near the intersection of Swan Road and Skyline Drive. Built by artist [[Ettore DeGrazia|Ted DeGrazia]] starting in 1951, the {{convert|10|acre|ha|adj=on}} property is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and features an eclectic chapel, an art gallery, and a museum.

[[File:Northwest Metro Tucson from the Santa Catalina Mountains.jpg|thumb|right|Northwestern suburbs viewed from the Santa Catalina Mountains]]

The expansive area northwest of the city limits is diverse, ranging from the rural communities of [[Catalina, Arizona|Catalina]] and parts of the town of [[Marana, Arizona|Marana]], the small suburb of [[Picture Rocks, Arizona|Picture Rocks]], the town of [[Oro Valley, Arizona|Oro Valley]] in the western foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains, and residential areas in the northeastern foothills of the Tucson Mountains. Continental Ranch (Marana), Dove Mountain (Marana), and Rancho Vistoso (Oro Valley), and Saddlebrooke (North Oro Valley) are all master planned communities in the northwest that have thousands of residents.

The community of [[Casas Adobes, Arizona|Casas Adobes]] is also on the Northwest side, with the distinction of being Tucson's first suburb, established in the late 1940s. Casas Adobes is centered on the historic [[Casas Adobes Plaza]] (built in 1948). Casas Adobes is also home to [[Tohono Chul Park]], which is now within the town of Oro Valley, (a nature preserve) near the intersection of North Oracle Road and West Ina Road. The [[2011 Tucson shooting|attempted assassination]] of Representative [[Gabby Giffords]], which resulted in the murders of chief judge for the [[United States District Court for the District of Arizona|U.S. District Court for Arizona]], [[John Roll]], and five other people on January 8, 2011, occurred at the La Toscana Village in Casas Adobes. The [[Foothills Mall (Arizona)|Foothills Mall]] is also on the northwest side in Casas Adobes.

This area is home to many of the Tucson area's golf courses and resorts, including the Preserve and Mountainview Golf Clubs at Saddlebrooke, Hilton El Conquistador Golf & Tennis Resort in Oro Valley, the Omni Tucson National Resort & Spa, and Westward Look Resort. The Ritz Carlton at Dove Mountain, the second [[Ritz Carlton]] resort in Arizona, which also includes a golf course, opened in the foothills of the [[Tortolita Mountains]] in northeast Marana in 2009.

====Eastern Tucson====
East Tucson is relatively new compared to other parts of the city, developed between the 1950s and the 1970s,{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} with developments such as [[Desert Palms Park, Tucson|Desert Palms Park]]. It is generally classified as the area of the city east of Swan Road, with above-average real estate values relative to the rest of the city. The area includes urban and suburban development near the [[Rincon Mountains]]. East Tucson includes [[Saguaro National Park|Saguaro National Park East]]. Tucson's "Restaurant Row" is also on the east side, along with a significant corporate and financial presence. Restaurant Row is sandwiched by three of Tucson's storied Vicinages: Harold Bell Wright Estates,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tucson.com/news/blogs/streetsmarts/harold-bell-wright-the-inspiration-for-tucson-vicinage/article_33e43eba-bfe3-5809-a83c-bacf4194ba1f.html|title=Harold Bell Wright the inspiration for Tucson vicinage|author=David Leighton|newspaper=Arizona Daily Star|date=November 25, 2014 |access-date=September 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190419204851/https://tucson.com/news/blogs/streetsmarts/harold-bell-wright-the-inspiration-for-tucson-vicinage/article_33e43eba-bfe3-5809-a83c-bacf4194ba1f.html|archive-date=April 19, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> named after the author's ranch which occupied some of that area before the depression; the Tucson Country Club (the third to bear the name Tucson Country Club),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tucson.com/news/blogs/streetsmarts/street-smarts-country-club-golf-links-used-to-be-one/article_7000c651-d111-5e99-b212-46b60d29e769.html|title=Street Smarts: Country Club, Golf Links used to be one road|author=David Leighton|newspaper=Arizona Daily Star|date=April 27, 2015 |access-date=September 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912225710/http://tucson.com/news/blogs/streetsmarts/street-smarts-country-club-golf-links-used-to-be-one/article_7000c651-d111-5e99-b212-46b60d29e769.html|archive-date=September 12, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> and the Dorado Country Club. Tucson's largest office building is 5151 East Broadway in east Tucson, completed in 1975. The first phases of Williams Centre, a mixed-use, master-planned development on Broadway near Craycroft Road,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tucson.com/news/local/engineer-businessman-craycroft-built-impressive-home-for-its-time/article_088185c3-ab50-5d95-ad95-c8d91e711cc3.html|title=Engineer-businessman Craycroft built impressive home for its time|author=David Leighton|newspaper=Arizona Daily Star|access-date=September 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912225659/http://tucson.com/news/local/engineer-businessman-craycroft-built-impressive-home-for-its-time/article_088185c3-ab50-5d95-ad95-c8d91e711cc3.html|archive-date=September 12, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> were opened in 1987. [[Park Place (Tucson, Arizona)|Park Place]], a recently renovated shopping center, is also along Broadway (west of Wilmot Road).

Near the intersection of Craycroft and Ft. Lowell Roads are the remnants of the Historic Fort Lowell. This area has become one of Tucson's iconic neighborhoods. In 1891, the Fort was abandoned and much of the interior was stripped of their useful components and it quickly fell into ruin. In 1900, three of the officer buildings were purchased for use as a sanitarium. The sanitarium was then sold to Harvey Adkins in 1928. The Bolsius family – Pete, Nan and [[Charles Bolsius|Charles]] – purchased and renovated surviving adobe buildings of the Fort, transforming them into spectacular artistic southwestern architectural examples. Their woodwork, plaster treatment and sense of proportion drew on their Dutch heritage and New Mexican experience.

Other artists and academics throughout the middle of the 20th century, including Win Ellis, [[Jack Maul]], Madame [[Germaine Cheruy]] and [[René Cheruy]], Giorgio Belloli, Charles Bode, [[Veronica Hughart]], [[Edward H. Spicer]] and [[Rosamond Spicer]], [[Hazel Larson Archer]] and Ruth Brown, renovated adobes, built homes and lived in the area. The artist colony attracted writers and poets including beat generation Alan Harrington and [[Jack Kerouac]] whose visit is documented in his iconic book ''[[On the Road]]''. This rural pocket in the middle of the city is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Each year in February the vicinage celebrates its history in the City Landmark it owns and restored the [[San Pedro Chapel]].

Situated between the [[Santa Catalina Mountains]] and the [[Rincon Mountains]] near [[Redington Pass]] northeast of the city limits is the affluent community of [[Tanque Verde, Arizona|Tanque Verde]]. The Arizona National Golf Club, Forty-Niners Country Club, and the historic Tanque Verde Guest Ranch are also in northeast Tucson.

Southeast Tucson continues to experience rapid residential development. The area includes [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]]. The area is considered to be south of Golf Links Road. It is the home of Santa Rita High School, Chuck Ford Park (Lakeside Park), [[Lakeside Lake]], Lincoln Park (upper and lower), The Lakecrest Vicinagess, and Pima Community College East Campus. The Atterbury Wash with its access to excellent bird watching is also in the Southeast Tucson area. The suburban community of [[Rita Ranch]] houses many of the military families from Davis-Monthan, and is near the southeasternmost expansion of the current city limits. Close by Rita Ranch and also within the city limits lies Civano,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tucson.com/news/local/street-smarts-civano-honors-notable-tucsonans-who-gave-to-their/article_ed9df1c4-0cca-5f69-b59e-1c4dc477b236.html|title=Street Smarts: Civano honors notable Tucsonans who gave to their community|author=David Leighton|newspaper=Arizona Daily Star|date=October 2, 2017 |access-date=July 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707202343/https://tucson.com/news/local/street-smarts-civano-honors-notable-tucsonans-who-gave-to-their/article_ed9df1c4-0cca-5f69-b59e-1c4dc477b236.html|archive-date=July 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> a planned development meant to showcase ecologically sound building practices and lifestyles.

===Climate===
Tucson has a hot [[desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BWh''), with two major seasons, a hot summer and mild winter. Tucson averages {{convert|10.61|in|mm|1}} of precipitation per year, concentrated during the Pacific storms of winter and the [[North American Monsoon]] of summer. Fall and spring tend to be sunny and dry.<ref>McKnight & Hess, pp. 212 ''ff'', "Climate Zones and Types: Dry Climates (Zone B)".</ref> Despite being at a more southerly latitude than Phoenix, Tucson is slightly cooler and wetter due to a variety of factors, including elevation and [[orographic lift]] in surrounding mountains, though Tucson does occasionally see warmer daytime temperatures in the winter.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix-weather/2017/12/01/why-tucson-winter-can-be-warmer-than-phoenix/903557001/ |title=Why Tucson can be warmer than Phoenix in winter |publisher=azcentral.com |access-date=June 13, 2020}}</ref>

[[File:Tucsonmonsoon.jpg|thumb|right|Monsoon clouds blanketed the Catalina Mountains in August 2005.]]

Summer is characterized by average daily high temperatures between {{convert|98|and|102|°F|°C|0}} and low temperatures between {{convert|71|and|77|°F|°C|0}}. Early summer is characterized by low humidity and clear skies; mid- and late summer are characterized by higher humidity, cloudy skies, and frequent rain. The sun is intense in Tucson during part of the year, and those who spend time outdoors need protection. Recent studies show that the rate of skin cancer in Arizona is at least three times higher than in more northerly regions. Additionally, [[heat stroke]] is a concern for hikers, mountain bikers, and adventurers who explore canyons, open desert lands, and other exposed areas.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11568742 | doi=10.1067/mjd.2001.114742 | volume=45 | issue=4 | title=Trends in the incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancers in southeastern Arizona, 1985-1996 | journal=J Am Acad Dermatol | pages=528–36 | last1 = Harris | first1 = RB | last2 = Griffith | first2 = K | last3 = Moon | first3 = TE| year=2001 }}</ref>

While monsoon season officially begins on June 15, the arrival of the North American Monsoon is unpredictable, as it varies from year to year. On average, Tucson receives its first monsoon storms around July 3. Monsoon activity generally persists through August and often into September.<ref name="moonsoon-2006">[http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/twc/monsoon/monsoon.php NWS Tucson Office Monsoon tracker] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818053548/http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/twc/monsoon/monsoon.php |date=August 18, 2006 }}.

It begins with clouds building up from the south in the early afternoon, followed by intense thunderstorms and rainfall, which can cause [[flash floods]]. The evening sky at this time of year is often pierced with dramatic lightning strikes. Large areas of the city do not have [[storm sewer]]s, so monsoon rains flood the main thoroughfares, usually for no longer than a few hours.

The weather in the fall is much like spring, dry, with warm/cool nights and warm/hot days. Temperatures above {{convert|100|°F|0}} are possible into early October. Temperatures decline at the quickest rate in October and November, and are normally the coolest in late December and early January.

Winters in Tucson are mild relative to other parts of the United States. Average daytime highs range between {{convert|65|and|70|°F|°C|0}}, with overnight lows between {{convert|40|and|44|°F|°C|0}}. Tucson typically averages three hard freezes per winter season, with temperatures dipping to the mid- or low 20 degrees F (−4 to −7&nbsp;°C), but this is typically limited to only a very few nights. Although rare, snow occasionally falls in lower elevations in Tucson and is common in the Santa Catalina Mountains. The most recent snowfall was on March 2, 2023, when a [[Early-March 2023 North American storm complex|winter storm]] caused snow to fall throughout most of the southwest.

==Economy==
[[File:Tucson shab1.JPG|thumb|right|Downtown Tucson with the University of Arizona in the background]]

Much of Tucson's economic development has centered on the development of the University of Arizona, which is the city's largest employer. [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]], on the city's southeastern edge, also provides many jobs for Tucson residents. Its presence, as well as the presence of the US Army Intelligence Center ([[Fort Huachuca]], the region's largest employer, in nearby Sierra Vista), has led to the development of many high-technology industries, including government contractors. The city of Tucson is also a major hub for the Union Pacific Railroad's Sunset Route that links the Los Angeles ports with the South/Southeast regions of the country.

Tourism is another major industry in Tucson. The city's many resorts, hotels, and attractions bring in $2&nbsp;billion and over 3.5&nbsp;million visitors annually.<ref>Long, Levy J.

One of the major annual attractions is the [[Tucson Gem and Mineral Show]], and its associated shows, all held generally in the first two weeks of February. These associated shows (such as gems, jewelry, beads, and fossils) are held throughout the city, with 43 different shows in 2010. This makes Tucson's the largest such exposition in the world. Its yearly economic impact in 2015 was evaluated at $120&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://biztucson.com/2015/01/16/worlds-biggest-gem-show-120-million-economic-impact/|title=BizTUCSON {{!}} World's Biggest Gem Show – $120 Million Economic Impact|language=en-US|access-date=November 23, 2019|archive-date=August 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200809131818/https://biztucson.com/2015/01/16/worlds-biggest-gem-show-120-million-economic-impact/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In addition to vacationers, many winter residents, or "[[Snowbird (person)|snowbirds]]", are attracted to Tucson's mild winters and live here on a seasonal basis. They also contribute to the local economy. Snowbirds often purchase [[Vacation property|second homes]] in Tucson and nearby areas, contributing significantly to the property tax base.

==== El Tour de Tucson ====
[[El Tour de Tucson]] is a cycling race that has been happening in Tucson since 1983. The race tends to happen in the month of November, before [[Thanksgiving (United States)|American Thanksgiving]]. There are a number of distances available to ride, from 1-mile fun rides to a long distance ride that spans the whole city resulting in 102 miles. In addition to being a competitive race, this race also allows non-profit charities to raise funds for their organizations. The race was first held by the [[Perimeter Bicycling Association]] in 1983 with less than 200 cyclists, and raised $4,500; by 2023 there have been close to 9,000 cyclists and raised $5.8 million.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About Perimeter {{!}} El Tour de Tucson – Perimeter Bicycling |url=https://eltourdetucson.org/about-perimeter/ |access-date=2024-10-07 |language=en-US}}</ref> It was recently named a top 10 road race in the United States, ranking at #4.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-04-10 |title=Top 10 Road Cycling Events in 2024 Ranked by USA Today - Unlimited Biking Blog |url=https://www.unlimitedbiking.com/blog/uncategorized/top-10-road-cycling-events-in-2024-ranked-by-usa-today/ |access-date=2024-10-07 |language=en-US}}</ref>

For the past 33 years, the Tucson Folk Festival has taken place the first Saturday and Sunday of May in downtown Tucson's El Presidio Park. In addition to nationally known headline acts each evening, the Festival highlights over 100 local and regional musicians on five stages and is one of the largest free festivals in the country. All stages are within easy walking distance. Organized by the Tucson Kitchen Musicians' Association,<ref>[http://www.tkma.org The Tucson Folk Festival homepage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506020553/http://tkma.org/ |date=May 6, 2018 }}.

[[KXCI]] 91.3-FM, Arizona's only community radio station, is a major partner, broadcasting from the Plaza Stage throughout the weekend. There are also many workshops, events for children, sing-alongs, and a popular singer-songwriter contest. Musicians typically play 30-minute sets, supported by professional audio staff volunteers. A variety of food and crafts are available at the festival, as well as local microbrews. All proceeds help fund future festivals.

====Fourth Avenue Street Fair====
[[File:US Navy 070317-N-5324D-002 Sailors from the Los Angeles-class fast attack submarine USS Tucson (SSN 770) and Navy Operational Support Center Tucson take part in the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade.jpg|thumb|right|Sailors take part in the annual [[St. Patrick's Day]] parade.]]
There are two Fourth Avenue Street Fairs, in December and late March/early April, staged between 9th Street and University Boulevard, that feature arts and crafts booths, food vendors and street performers. The fairs began in 1970 when Fourth Avenue, which at the time had half a dozen thrift shops, several New Age bookshops and the Food Conspiracy Co-Op, was a gathering place for [[hippies]], and a few merchants put tables in front of their stores to attract customers before the holidays.

These days, the street fair has grown into a large corporate event, with most tables owned by outside merchants. It hosts mostly traveling craftsmen selling various arts such as pottery, paintings, wood working, metal decorations, candles, and many others.

====Tucson Rodeo (Fiesta de los Vaqueros)====

Another popular event held in February, which is early spring in Tucson, is the Fiesta de los Vaqueros, or [[rodeo]] week, founded by winter visitor, Leighton Kramer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tucson.com/news/local/street-smarts-kramer-ave-named-for-winter-visitor-who-helped/article_83577fb0-db6d-5bee-a64a-e5a35dd52130.html|title=Street Smarts: Kramer Ave. named for winter visitor who helped start rodeo, parade in 1925|author=David Leighton|newspaper=Arizona Daily Star|access-date=July 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707202438/https://tucson.com/news/local/street-smarts-kramer-ave-named-for-winter-visitor-who-helped/article_83577fb0-db6d-5bee-a64a-e5a35dd52130.html|archive-date=July 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> While at its heart the Fiesta is a sporting event, it includes what is billed as "the world's largest non-mechanized parade".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Tucson Rodeo Parade |url=http://www.tucsonrodeoparade.com/Pages001/Parade.htm |access-date=March 12, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301085026/http://tucsonrodeoparade.com/Pages001/Parade.htm |archive-date=March 1, 2010}}</ref> The Rodeo Parade is a popular event as most schools give two rodeo days off instead of Presidents' Day. The exception is Presidio High (a non-public charter school), which does not get either. Western wear is seen throughout the city as corporate dress codes are cast aside during the Fiesta. The Fiesta de los Vaqueros marks the beginning of the rodeo season in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=August 2023}}

===Cyclovia Tucson===
Cyclovia Tucson is an annual event supported by Living Streets Alliance that invites people of all ages and abilities to walk, bike, and roll down car-free streets for a day. Cyclovia is an Open Streets initiative designed to maximize the enormous amount of space taken up by roads in sprawling cities like Tucson. Since 2012, Cyclovia transforms the streets of metro Tucson into a block party atmosphere to socialize, incorporating partnerships with small businesses, and giving people the opportunity to move freely through the streets without moving cars. Cyclovia happens twice a year, typically in the spring and in the fall.

===Nicknames===
Tucson is commonly known as "The Old Pueblo". While the exact origin of this nickname is uncertain, it is commonly traced back to Mayor [[Robert N. Leatherwood|R. N. "Bob" Leatherwood]]. When [[railroad|rail service]] was established to the city on March 20, 1880, Leatherwood celebrated the fact by sending telegrams to various leaders, including the [[President of the United States]] and the [[Pope]], announcing the "ancient and honorable pueblo" of Tucson was now connected by rail to the outside world. The term became popular with newspaper writers who often abbreviated it as "A. and H. Pueblo".

===Parks and recreation===
The city has more than 120 parks, from small and local to larger parks with ballfields, natural areas, lakes, 5 public golf courses, and [[Reid Park Zoo]]. The [[The Loop (Tucson)|Loop]] is a popular system of shared-use paths encircling the city primarily along washes and is usually well-separated from traffic. Several scenic parks and points of interest are also nearby, including the [[Tucson Botanical Gardens]], [[Tohono Chul Park]], [[Saguaro National Park]], [[Sabino Canyon]], and [[Biosphere 2]] (just north of the city, near the town of [[Oracle, Arizona|Oracle]]).

[[Tumamoc Hill]] is an active research site maintained by the [[University of Arizona]] and [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]] that doubles as a popular walking/running trail. The paved trail on Tumamoc Hill is 1.5 miles uphill (3 miles full trip), divided into two parts. The lower half is a much more gradual slope compared to the steep upper half reaching a final elevation of 2,340&nbsp;ft where it overlooks most of the city of Tucson. The trail attracts around 1500 visits a day from various demographics of the Tucson area.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Walk the Hill {{!}} Desert Laboratory on Tumamoc Hill|url=https://tumamoc.arizona.edu/walk-hill|access-date=August 20, 2020|newspaper=Desert Laboratory on Tumamoc Hill|date=February 13, 2020}}</ref>

The [[League of American Bicyclists]] gave Tucson a gold rating for bicycle friendliness in late April 2007. Tucson hosts the largest perimeter cycling event in the United States. The ride, called "[[El Tour de Tucson]]", takes place each November on the Saturday before Thanksgiving. [[El Tour de Tucson]] produced and promoted by [[Perimeter Bicycling]] has had as many as 10,000 participants from all over the world. In 2019, ridership is expected to be 6,000 cyclists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kvoa.com/news/local-news/2019/11/22/el-tour-de-tucson-2019-what-to-know/|title=El Tour de Tucson 2019: What to know|date=November 22, 2019|website=KVOA.com|language=en-US|access-date=November 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191122205252/https://kvoa.com/news/local-news/2019/11/22/el-tour-de-tucson-2019-what-to-know/|archive-date=November 22, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Tucson is one of only nine cities in the U.S. to receive a gold rating or higher for cycling friendliness from the [[League of American Bicyclists]].

In general, Tucson and Pima County support the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], while the state's largest metropolitan area, greater Phoenix, has traditionally supported the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Congressional redistricting in 2013, following the publication of the 2010 Census, divided the Tucson area into three Federal Congressional districts (the first, second and third of Arizona). The city center is in the 3rd District, represented by [[Raul Grijalva]], a Democrat, since 2003, while the more affluent residential areas to the south and east are in the 2nd District, represented by Democrat [[Ann Kirkpatrick]] since 2019, and the exurbs north and west between Tucson and Phoenix in the 1st District are represented by Democrat [[Tom O'Halleran]] since 2016.<ref>{{cite news|title=Feds give OK to new Ariz. congressional maps|url=http://www.insidetucsonbusiness.com/news/feds-give-ok-to-new-ariz-congressional-maps/article_47106c7c-84df-11e1-8c06-001a4bcf887a.html|access-date=February 2, 2013|newspaper=Inside Tucson Business|date=April 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305035301/http://www.insidetucsonbusiness.com/news/feds-give-ok-to-new-ariz-congressional-maps/article_47106c7c-84df-11e1-8c06-001a4bcf887a.html|archive-date=March 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===City government===
{{see also|List of mayors of Tucson, Arizona}}
Tucson follows the "weak mayor" model of the [[council–manager government|council-manager]] form of local government. The six-member city council holds exclusive legislative authority, and shares executive authority with the mayor, who is elected by the voters independently of the council. An appointed city manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the city. Tucson is the only city in Arizona that holds officially partisan elections for city offices, with candidates nominated through party primaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ballot-access.org/2018/01/05/arizona-legislature/|title=Arizona Legislature {{!}} Ballot Access News|website=ballot-access.org|language=en-US|access-date=January 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105212401/http://ballot-access.org/2018/01/05/arizona-legislature/|archive-date=January 5, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Both the council members and the mayor serve four-year terms; none face term limits. Council members are nominated by their wards via a ward-level primary held in August. The top vote-earners from each party then compete at-large for their ward's seat on the November ballot. In other words, on [[Election Day (politics)|election day]] the whole city votes on all the council races up for that year. Council elections are severed: Wards 1, 2, and 4 (as well as the mayor) are up for election in the same year (most recently 2015), while Wards 3, 5, and 6 share another year (most recently 2017).

Tucson is known for being a trailblazer in voluntary partial [[campaign finance|publicly financed campaigns]]. Since 1985, both mayoral and council candidates have been eligible to receive matching public funds from the city. To become eligible, council candidates must receive 200 donations of $10 or more (300 for a mayoral candidate). Candidates must then agree to spending limits equal to 33¢ for every registered Tucson voter, or $79,222 in 2005 (the corresponding figures for mayor are 64¢ per registered voter, or $142,271 in 2003). In return, candidates receive matching funds from the city at a 1:1 ratio of public money to private donations. The only other limitation is that candidates may not exceed 75% of the limit by the date of the primary. Many cities, such as San Francisco and New York City, have copied this system, albeit with more complex spending and matching formulas.

Mayor [[Regina Romero]] (D) was sworn into office on December 2, 2019, succeeding [[Jonathan Rothschild]] (D) who was sworn into office on December 5, 2011, succeeding [[Robert E. Walkup]] (R), who took office in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/mayor|title=Mayor Bob Walkup – City of Tucson Web|date=February 13, 2010|website=tucsonaz.gov|access-date=July 7, 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213101425/http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/mayor|archive-date=February 13, 2010}}</ref> Walkup was preceded by [[George Miller (Arizona politician)|George Miller]] (D), 1991–1999; [[Tom Volgy]] (D), 1987–1991; [[Lew Murphy]] (R), 1971–1987; and [[Jim Corbett (politician)|Jim Corbett]] (D), 1967–1971.

==Infrastructure==
===Energy===
Tucson's primary electrical power source is a natural gas power plant managed by [[Tucson Electric Power]] that is within the city limits on the southwestern boundary of Davis-Monthan Air-force base adjacent to Interstate 10. The air pollution generated has raised some concerns as the Sundt operating station has been online since 1962 and is exempt from many pollution standards and controls due to its age.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vanderpool|first=Tim|title=Polluting the Poor:TEP's southside coal plant keeps on pumping out noxious gases|url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/polluting-the-poor/Content?oid=3596947|publisher=Tucson Weekly|access-date=December 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228013941/http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/polluting-the-poor/Content?oid=3596947|archive-date=December 28, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>
Solar has been gaining ground in Tucson with its ideal over 300 days of sunshine climate. Federal, state, and even local utility credits and incentives have also enticed residents to equip homes with solar systems.
Davis-Monthan AFB has a 3.3 [[Megawatt]] (MW) ground-mounted [[solar photovoltaic]] (PV) array and a 2.7 MW rooftop-mounted PV array, both of which are in the Base Housing area. The base will soon have the largest solar-generating capacity in the [[United States Department of Defense]] after awarding a contract on September 10, 2010, to [[SunEdison]] to construct a 14.5 MW PV field on the northwestern side of the base.<ref>{{cite web |id=Release: 050910 |url=http://www.dm.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123222163 |title=D-M awards solar photovoltaic utility contract to SunEdison |publisher=Dm.af.mil |access-date=October 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929230631/http://www.dm.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123222163 |archive-date=September 29, 2011}}</ref>

===Water===
[[File:Snowy Catalinas.jpg|thumb|right|The nearby Santa Catalina Mountains, covered in snow]]

Less than 100 years ago, the [[Santa Cruz River (Arizona)|Santa Cruz River]] flowed nearly year-round through Tucson. This supply of water has slowly disappeared, causing Tucson to seek alternative sources.

In 1881, water was pumped from a well on the banks of the Santa Cruz River and flowed by gravity through pipes into the distribution system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.tucsonaz.gov/water/about-us|title=About Tucson Water|website=M.tucsonaz.gov|access-date=December 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329083415/http://m.tucsonaz.gov/water/about-us|archive-date=March 29, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Tucson currently draws water from two main sources: [[Central Arizona Project]] (CAP) water and [[groundwater]]. In 1992, Tucson Water delivered CAP water to some customers that was unacceptable due to discoloration, bad odor and flavor, as well as problems it caused with some customers' plumbing and appliances. Tucson's city water currently consists of CAP water mixed with groundwater.

In an effort to conserve water, Tucson is recharging groundwater supplies by running part of its share of CAP water into various open portions of local rivers to seep into their aquifer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.tucson.az.us/water/heritage.htm |title=Tucson Water—Tucson Water's Heritage |website=www.ci.tucson.az.us |access-date=January 17, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703194522/http://www.ci.tucson.az.us/water/heritage.htm |archive-date=July 3, 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Additional study is scheduled to determine how much water is lost through evaporation from the open areas, especially during the summer. The City of Tucson provides [[reclaimed water]] to its inhabitants, but it is only used for "applications such as irrigation, dust control, and industrial uses".<ref name="City of Tucson-2012">{{cite web | title = Reclaimed Water | publisher = City of Tucson | year = 2012 | url = http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/water/reclaimed | access-date = March 22, 2012 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120505110418/http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/water/reclaimed | archive-date = May 5, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> These resources have been in place for more than 27 years, and deliver to over 900 locations.<ref name="City of Tucson-2012"/>

To prevent further loss of groundwater, Tucson has been involved in water conservation and groundwater preservation efforts, shifting away from its reliance on a series of Tucson area wells in favor of conservation, consumption-based pricing for residential and commercial water use, and new wells in the more sustainable Avra Valley aquifer, northwest of the city. An allocation from the [[Central Arizona Project Aqueduct]] (CAP), which passes more than {{convert|300|mi|-1|abbr=on}} across the desert from the [[Colorado River]], has been incorporated into the city's water supply, annually providing over 20 million gallons of "recharged" water which is pumped into the ground to replenish water pumped out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/water/clearwater_faqs |title=Clearwater Frequently Asked Questions &#124; The Official Website for the City of Tucson, Arizona |publisher=Cms3.tucsonaz.gov |access-date=October 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105141442/http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/water/clearwater_faqs |archive-date=November 5, 2011}}</ref> Since 2001, CAP water has allowed the city to remove or turn off over 80 wells.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/files/water/docs/coloradoriver.pdf |title=Tucson Water's Long Range Water Resource Planning |publisher=City of Tucson |access-date=January 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516095331/http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/files/water/docs/coloradoriver.pdf |archive-date=May 16, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==== Water harvesting ====
The city of Tucson, Arizona provides financial incentives for residents to harvest their rainwater. Tucson's water supply, like many Western cities, is drawn from two main sources: surface water that is pumped more than 300 miles from the Colorado River and groundwater.<ref name="Malloy-2020">{{Cite web|last=Malloy|first=Chris|date=November 23, 2020|title=A Desert City Tries to Save Itself With Rain|website=[[Bloomberg News]]|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-23/harvesting-rainwater-in-a-desert-city}}</ref> The pump expends a significant amount of energy and the Colorado River is diminishing as a result of climate change and overuse.

In 2012, the city began a program that rebates residents as much as $2,000 for the purchase of water harvesting systems. "Water harvesting" refers to rainwater, which is gathered from building surfaces, and stormwater'','' which collects nonpotable storm runoff from streets and earth. The program is financed by a water bill fee of 10 cents per 748 gallons of city water used. In the first few years, the rebate program was not conserving water as efficiently as they anticipated. But in fiscal year 2018 to 2019, the rebate program saved 52.1 million gallons of water.<ref name="Malloy-2020" /> That is enough water to meet the annual usage of 160 households.<ref name="Malloy-2020" /> The city has been trying to grow the approximately 250 people who obtain active rebates each year by introducing a loan program to bring rebates within reach of lower-income residents.

The city government has an ambitious goal to be carbon neutral by 2030 and is integrating changes that will help change local resident's conventional thinking and practices. On May 1, 2020, Tucson began charging residents and businesses within city limits a monthly Green Stormwater Infrastructure fee (13 cents per 748 gallons of city water used), which is projected to raise some $3&nbsp;million a year for public stormwater capture installations and other projects.<ref name="Malloy-2020" /> But this comes at a time when unemployment is rising and the number of low income residents facing unaffordable bills between 2010 and 2018 doubled to 46% as the average bill increased by 119% in Tucson.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lakhani|first=Nina|date=June 23, 2020|title=Revealed: millions of Americans can't afford water as bills rise 80% in a decade|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/23/millions-of-americans-cant-afford-water-bills-rise|access-date=December 1, 2020|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Additionally, as part of the citywide climate resiliency effort, Mayor Regina Romero recently announced the planting of a million trees over the next decade.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sayers|first=Justin|title=For Mayor Romero, 1 million planted trees in city admittedly a 'big effort'|url=https://tucson.com/news/local/for-mayor-romero-1-million-planted-trees-in-city-admittedly-a-big-effort/article_81c4c718-ef9c-5b65-aae2-d6bf979f3c1d.html|access-date=December 1, 2020|website=Arizona Daily Star|date=February 15, 2020 |language=en}}</ref>
