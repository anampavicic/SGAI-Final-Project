'''Najran''' ({{langx|ar|نجران}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Najrān}}''), is a city in southwestern [[Saudi Arabia]]. It is the capital of [[Najran Province]]. Designated as a [[new town]], Najran is one of the fastest-growing cities in the kingdom. Its population grew from 47,500 in 1974 to 90,983 in 1992, 246,880 in 2004, and 381,431 in 2021. The city's population mostly originates from the ancient tribes of Hamdan (Wailh & Yam).

Najranis are Muslims, with [[Isma'ilism|Ismailis]] forming a plurality. [[Hanbali]], [[Shafi'i]], and [[Maliki]] [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]] form the second-largest religious group in the city.

The [[Arabic]] term ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Najrān}}'' meaning: As Local tradition  claims that the land derived its name from the first man to settle in the area, Najran ibn Yahjub ibn Yarub ibn Qahtan ibn houd.

Najran was a centre of cloth-making, and the ''kiswah,'' or the cloth of the [[Ka'aba]], was originally made there. Najran were always a center for religious beliefs, following the three main religions consecutively. Firstly, A Jewish community then later on A Christian community existed in Najran. According to [[Najran Jews|Najran Jewish]] tradition, the Jews of Najran traced their origin to the [[Ten Lost Tribes|Ten Tribes]]. Najran was also an important stopping hub on the [[incense trade route]].

===Early history===

The history of Najrān can be traced back to 4,000 years ago. It was once occupied by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]; in fact, it was the first [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] city to fall to the Romans on their way to the kingdom of [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi']]. Najrān's most prosperous trading time was during the 1st and 2nd centuries BC. In ancient times it was known as [[Al-Ukhdūd]].{{cn|date=May 2024}}

Similar to other ancient place names in Arabia, Najrān may have originally been the name of the whole oasis, including all towns and villages. The old name of the ruins now known as "al-Ukhdūd", which may have been the central town, probably corresponds to Ramat.

According to Greek and Roman sources, Najrān was a focal point of the [[Incense Route]]. All routes that left ancient Yemen to the north or west had to meet at Najrān, where the routes branched into two general directions: ones leading north through the [[Hijaz|Ḥijāz]] towards Egypt and the [[Levant]], and those leading to the northeast towards [[Gerrha]] near the [[Persian Gulf]].<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/pss/614822 Description] in A. F. L. Beeston "Some Observations on Greek and Latin Data Relating to South Arabia"
in ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'', University of London, Vol. 42, No. 1 (1979), pp. 7–12; online at [https://www.jstor.org JSTOR]</ref>

The Roman prefect of Egypt [[Aelius Gallus]] led a costly, arduous, and ultimately unsuccessful expedition to conquer [[Arabia Felix]], and won a battle near Najrān in 25 BC. He occupied the city and used it as a base from which to attack the Sabaean capital at [[Ma'rib]]. This is according to [[Strabo]],<ref>Strabo, [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/16D*.html Book XVI, Chapter 4, 22–24] ''The Geography of Strabo'', published in Vol. VII of the Loeb Classical Library edition, 1932; online at [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/home.html Lacus Curtius]</ref> who called it 'Negrana'.

When the [[Himyarite Kingdom|Ḥimyarites]] conquered the Sabeans in AD 280, they probably also took control of Najrān. Sometime during the 3rd century, the people of Najrān sided with the Abyssinians, who sent a governor named Sqlmqlm in inscriptions. The Ḥimyar King Ilsharah Yahdib crushed this rebellion.{{cn|date=May 2024}}

The north Arabian [[Lakhmid]] king Imru’ al-Qays ibn 'Amqu attacked Najrān in AD 328. Under the influence of [[Axum]], the Christians in Najrān thrived and started an alliance with Aksum again at the beginning of the 6th century.{{cn|date=May 2024}}

The town of Najrān was already an important centre of arms manufacture during the lifetime of [[Muhammad]]. However, it was more famous for [[leather]] rather than [[iron]].{{cn|date=May 2024}}

===Early Christian community===
{{Main|Christian community of Najran}}
[[Christianity]] was likely introduced into Najrān, as in the rest of South Arabia, in the 5th century AD or perhaps a century earlier. According to the [[Arab people|Arab]] [[Historiography of early Islam|Muslim historian]] [[Ibn Ishaq|Ibn Isḥāq]], Najrān was the first place where Christianity took root in South Arabia.{{cn|date=May 2024}}
According to contemporary sources, after seizing the throne of the Ḥimyarites in ca. 518 or 523, [[Dhu Nuwas|Dhū Nuwās]], a Jewish king,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/historians-back-bbc-over-jewish-massacre-claim| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090928001337/http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/historians-back-bbc-over-jewish-massacre-claim| archive-date = 2009-09-28| title = Historians back BBC over Jewish massacre claim {{!}} The Jewish Chronicle}} </ref> attacked the mainly Christian [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksumite]] garrison at [[Zafar, Yemen|Zafar]], capturing it and burning its churches. He then moved against Najrān, a Christian and Aksumite stronghold. After accepting the city's capitulation, he massacred those inhabitants who would not renounce Christianity. Estimates of the death toll from this event range up to 20,000 in some sources.{{cn|date=May 2024}} A surviving letter (where he is called ''Dimnon'') written by [[Simeon of Beth Arsham|Simeon]], the bishop of [[Beth Arsham]] in 524 AD, recounts Dhū Nuwās's persecution in Najrān (modern al-Ukhdūd in [[Saudi Arabia]]).<ref>Simon's letter is part of Part III of ''The Chronicle of Zuqnin'', translated by Amir Harrack (Toronto: [[Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies]], 1999), pp. 78-84.</ref> The massacre is also recounted in a celebratory manner in an inscription ([[Ja 1028]]) commissioned by one of the army commanders of Dhu Nuwas.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Lindstedt |first=Ilkka |title=Muhammad and his followers in context: the religious map of late antique Arabia |date=2023 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-68712-7 |series=Islamic history and civilization |location=Leiden Boston |pages=74–75}}</ref>

According to the ''Siyar of ash-Shaybani'', the Christians of Najrān made an agreement to pay Muhammad an annual tribute of 2,000 pieces of clothing, in return for which they were promised protection. The agreement was renewed under the caliphs Abū Bakr and Umar ibn al-Khattab.<ref>Majid Khadduri: The Islamic Law of Nations: Shaybānī's Siyar. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press 1966. S. 278–280</ref> In 641, however, the Christians of Najrān were accused of usury and ordered to leave the city.<ref> Leone Caetani: Annali dell' Islam. Bd. IV. Milano 1911. S. 354–359</ref> Under the reign of the [[Umar|Caliph ‘Umar]], the Christian community of Najrān was deported to Mesopotamia, where they settled near Kufa in a place they called Najānīya. In the following period, Najrān lost its importance.<ref>Hitti, Phillip. History of the Arabs from the Earliest Time to the Present. New York: Macmillan, 1951. p. 61</ref> According to the report of Ibn al-Mujavir, however, Jews and Christians still made up two thirds of the population of Najran in the 13th century.{{cn|date=May 2024}}

===Former Jewish community===
{{Main|History of the Jews in Saudi Arabia}}
[[File: Rabbi Salomon Halevi and Rebecca Cohen, Paradesi Jews of Madras.jpg|thumb|right|Rabbi Salomon Halevi (Last Rabbi of [[Madras Synagogue]]) and his wife Rebecca Cohen (Najran Jew), [[Paradesi Jews]] of Madras]]
Najrān had a Jewish community dating back to pre-Islamic times, historically affiliated with the [[Banu al-Harith]], who were [[Yemenite Jews]] that had conquered the city and ruled until the Christian invasion of Yemen.<ref>Gilbert, Martin, "In Ishmael's House", 2000, (p. 5)</ref> With the Saudi conquest of Najrān in 1934, persecution increased, and some 200 Jews of Najrān fled south to [[Aden]] between September and October 1949. The Saudi king [[ibn Saud]] demanded their return, but the Yemeni king [[Ahmad bin Yahya|Aḥmad bin Yaḥyá]] refused because these refugees were Yemenite Jews. After settling in the Ḥashid Camp (also called Mahane Geula) they were airlifted to [[Israel]] as part of the larger [[Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)|Operation Magic Carpet]].<ref>Gilbert, Martin, "In Ishmael's House", 2000, (p. 271)</ref>

Some groups of Najrān Jews escaped to [[Cochin State|Cochin]], as they had a very good relationship with its rulers and maintained trade connections with [[Paradesi Jews]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.madrasmusings.com/vol-27-no-20/the-last-family-of-pardesi-jews-in-madras/|title=The last family of Pardesi Jews in Madras « Madras Musings &#124; We Care for Madras that is Chennai|date=9 February 2018}}</ref>

===Issues with the Ismaili community===
The [[Tayyibi Isma'ilism|Ismailis]], a religious and ethnic minority with historic roots in [[Najran Province|Najrān Province]] of southwestern Saudi Arabia, face increasing threats to their identity as a result of official discrimination. Official discrimination in Saudi Arabia against Ismāʻīlīs encompasses government employment, religious practices, and the justice system. Government officials exclude Ismāʻīlīs from decision making and publicly disparage their faith.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Ismāʻīlīs of Najrān. Second-class Saudi citizens|url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/saudiarabia0908web.pdf|publisher=Human Rights Watch|access-date=April 16, 2012|year=2008}}</ref>

With the arrival of [[Mishaal bin Saud|Mishʻal bin Suʻūd]] as the governor of Najrān in 1996, tensions between local authorities and the Ismaʻili population increased, culminating in a watershed confrontation between armed Ismaʻili demonstrators and police and army units outside Najrān's Holiday Inn hotel on April 23, 2000. Three months earlier, police had closed all [[Tayyibi Isma'ilism|Tayyibi]] Ismaʻili [[mosque]]s on a religious holiday. On April 23, after security forces and religious morality police arrested an Ismāʻīlī cleric, a large demonstration took place outside the Holiday Inn, where Governor Mishʻal resided. After the governor refused for hours to meet the petitioners, an exchange of fire between security forces and armed demonstrators left two Ismāʻīlīs dead and, according to some government accounts, killed one policeman as well.{{cn|date=May 2024}} Believing their religious identity to be under attack, Ismāʻili men erected defences around [[Khushaywah]], the seat of the Ismaʻili religious leader [[Da'i al-Mutlaq]]. Khushaywah, which includes the Manṣūrah Mosque complex, was also the spiritual capital of [[Sulaymani]] Ismaʻilis, a community with followers in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] as well as Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The army surrounded the Ismaʻili positions and placed the city under its control. The standoff ended later the same day without further bloodshed.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Ismailis of Najran.

==Archaeology==
[[File:Origineel_huis_Najran.JPG|thumb|Traditional house in Najran]]

Najrān city is famous for its archeological significance. Old Najrān was surrounded by a circular wall,{{when|date=September 2021}} 220 by 230 meters, built of square stone with defensive balconies. It contained several unique buildings. There is also a cemetery{{when|date=September 2021}} south of the external wall. Excavations of this site have uncovered glass, metals, pottery, and bronze artifacts. Square and rectangular buildings have also been found. At [[Al-Ukhdūd]] which is south of Najrān city, carvings from those days{{when|date=September 2021}} and human bones can be seen. A museum displays, among other items, a bronze lion head.{{when|date=September 2021}} Najrān's landmarks include the "Rass" stone,{{when|date=September 2021}} a 2-meter-high granite stone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nabataea.net/explore/cities_and_sites/najran/|title=Najran|website=nabataea.net}}</ref>{{clarify|reason=Archaeology & history w/o dates is completely useless.|date=September 2021}}

==Geography==

=== Topography===
Najran has three different geographic landscapes: oases, mountains, and the desert (on its eastern side).{{cn|date=May 2024}}

===Climate===
Najran has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BWh''), typical of the Arabian Peninsula. Rainfall is very sporadic, and consists of light individual rainfall.{{cn|date=May 2024}} Despite its location in far southern Saudi Arabia, Najran's average temperature is approximately {{convert|3.3|C-change|F-change|1|disp=or}} cooler than that of the Saudi capital [[Riyadh]], due to it being {{convert|700|m|ft|-1|disp=or}} higher in altitude.
