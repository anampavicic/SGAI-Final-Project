Pyongyang is one of the oldest cities in Korea.<ref name="EBPyongyang"/> It was the capital of two ancient Korean kingdoms, [[Gojoseon]] and [[Goguryeo]], and served as the secondary capital of [[Goryeo]]. Following the establishment of North Korea in 1948, Pyongyang became its ''[[de facto]]'' capital. The city was again devastated during the [[Korean War]], but was quickly rebuilt after the war with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] assistance.

Pyongyang is the political, industrial and transport center of North Korea. It is estimated that 99% of those living in Pyongyang are members, candidate members, or dependents of members of the ruling [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Collins |first=Robert |url=https://www.northkoreanchristians.com/Songbun.pdf |title=Marked for Life: Songbun, North Korea's Social Classification System |publisher=Committee for Human Rights in North Korea |year=2012 |isbn=978-0985648008 |location=United States |pages=69 |language=en |lccn=2012939299}}</ref> It is home to North Korea's major [[Government of North Korea|government institutions]], as well as the WPK which has its headquarters in the so-called [[Forbidden City (Pyongyang)|Forbidden City]].

==Names==
The name Pyongyang is borrowed from Korean "평양" (literally "flat land"), from McCune–Reischauer (MR) romanisation P'yŏngyang, a Sino-Korean word from 平壤. It indicates the geographical feature of the location to have a smooth terrain. In native Korean, the city was called "Buruna" ({{Korean|hangul=부루나|labels=no}})<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |date=2023-03-30 |title="'평양(平壤)' 지명은 '부루나'에서 유래" |url=http://www.spnews.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=63534 |access-date= |website=SPN 서울평양뉴스 |language=ko}}</ref> or less commonly "Barana" ({{Korean|hangul=바라나|labels=no}})<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |script-title=ko:평양이라는 이름의 유래 |url=http://www.uriminzokkiri.com/index.php?ptype=csense&mtype=view&no=1140 |access-date= |website=[[Uriminzokkiri]] |archive-date=17 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231117184832/http://www.uriminzokkiri.com/index.php?ptype=csense&mtype=view&no=1140 |url-status=dead }}</ref> which, using the [[Idu script|idu system]], was the pronunciation of the Chinese characters of "Pyongyang".<ref name=":0"/><ref name=":1"/> "Buru" ({{Korean|hangul=부루|labels=no}}) means "field" whereas "na" ({{Korean|hangul=나|labels=no}}) means "land", therefore the meaning of Pyongyang in native Korean would be "Land of the field".<ref name=":0"/>

After [[Death and state funeral of Kim Il Sung|Kim Il Sung's death]] in 1994, some members of [[Kim Jong Il]]'s faction proposed changing the name of Pyongyang to "Kim Il Sung City" ({{korean|hangul=김일성시|hanja=金日成市|links-no}}), but others suggested that North Korea should begin calling [[Seoul]] "Kim Il Sung City" instead and grant Pyongyang the moniker "Kim Jong Il City".

==History==
===Prehistory===
In 1955, archaeologists excavated evidence of prehistoric dwellings in a large ancient village in the Pyongyang area, called Kŭmtan-ni, dating to the [[Jeulmun pottery period|Jeulmun]] and [[Mumun pottery period|Mumun]] pottery periods.<ref>National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage. 2001. Geumtan-ri. ''Hanguk Gogohak Sajeon'' [Dictionary of Korean Archaeology], pp. 148–149. NRICH, Seoul. {{ISBN|89-5508-025-5}}</ref> North Koreans associate Pyongyang with the [[Korean mythology|mythological]] city of "[[Asadal]]", or ''[[Wanggeom-seong]]'', the first second millennium BC capital of [[Gojoseon]] ("Old Joseon") according to Korean historiographies beginning with the 13th-century ''[[Samguk yusa]]''.

Historians{{who|date=April 2018}} deny this claim because earlier Chinese historiographical works such as the ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'', ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas]]'', ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', and ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'', mention a much later "Joseon".{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The connection between the two therefore may have been asserted by North Korea for the use of propaganda.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Nevertheless, Pyongyang became a major city in old Joseon.

===Historical period===
[[File:Tomb of King Tongmyong, Pyongyang, North Korea.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Tomb of King Tongmyong]]]]
Pyongyang was founded in 1122 BC on the site of the capital of the legendary king [[Dangun]].<ref name="EBPyongyang"/> [[Wanggeom-seong]], which was in the location of Pyongyang, became the capital of [[Gojoseon]] from 194 to 108 BC. It fell in the [[Han conquest of Gojoseon]] in 108 BC. [[Emperor Wu of Han]] ordered four commanderies be set up, with [[Lelang Commandery]] in the center and its capital established as "Joseon" (朝鮮縣, 조선현) at the location of Pyongyang. Several archaeological findings from the later, [[Eastern Han]] (20–220 AD) period in the Pyeongyang area seems to suggest that Han forces later launched brief incursions around these parts.

The area around the city was called Nanglang during the early [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms period]]. As the capital of Nanglang ({{korean|hangul=낙랑국|hanja=樂浪國|labels=no}}),{{Efn |Nanglang-state is different from Lelang Commandery.}} Pyeongyang remained an important commercial and cultural outpost after the Lelang Commandery was destroyed by an expanding [[Goguryeo]] in 313.

Goguryeo moved its capital there in 427. According to [[Christopher I. Beckwith|Christopher Beckwith]], ''Pyongyang'' is the [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean reading]] of the name they gave it in their language: ''Piarna'', or "level land".<ref>{{Cite book |first=Christopher I. |last=Beckwith |title=Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-691-13589-2 |page=104}}</ref>

In 668, Pyongyang became the capital of the [[Protectorate General to Pacify the East]] established by the [[Tang dynasty]] of China. However, by 676, it was taken by [[Silla]], but left on the border between Silla and [[Balhae]]. Pyongyang was left abandoned during the [[Later Silla]] period, until it was recovered by [[Taejo of Goryeo|Wang Geon]] and decreed as the Western Capital of [[Goryeo]].

During the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)|Imjin War]], Pyongyang was captured by the Japanese and [[Battle of Pyongyang (1592)|held the city wall]] until they were defeated in the [[Siege of Pyongyang (1593)|Siege of Pyongyang]].<ref name="EBPyongyang"/> Later in the 17th century, it became temporarily occupied during the [[Qing invasion of Joseon]] until peace arrangements were made between Korea and Qing China. While the invasions made Koreans suspicious of foreigners, the influence of [[Christianity]] began to grow after the country opened itself up to foreigners in the 16th century. Pyongyang became the base of Christian expansion in Korea. By 1880 it had more than 100 churches and more Protestant missionaries than any other Asian city,<ref name="EBPyongyang">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/484693/Pyongyang |title=Pyongyang |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |access-date=19 April 2015}}</ref> and was called "the [[Jerusalem]] of the East".<ref>{{cite news |title=Pyongyang, one-time Jerusalem of East |url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/opinion/2021/03/197_304944.html |work=[[The Korea Times]] |date=2021-03-04 |access-date=13 March 2021 |archive-date=6 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210306130908/https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/opinion/2021/03/197_304944.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 25 August 1945, the [[25th Army (Soviet Union)|Soviet 25th Army]] entered Pyongyang and it became the temporary capital of the [[Provisional People's Committee for North Korea]]. A People's Committee was already established there, led by veteran Christian nationalist [[Cho Man-sik]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Making of Modern Korea |last=Buzo |first=Adrian |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-415-23749-1 |pages=54–57}}</ref> Pyongyang became the de facto capital of North Korea upon its establishment in 1948. At the time, the Pyongyang government aimed to recapture Korea's official capital, Seoul. [[Bombing of Pyongyang|Pyongyang was again severely damaged]] in the [[Korean War]], during which it was briefly occupied by South Korean forces from 19 October to 6 December 1950. The city saw many refugees evacuate when advancing Chinese forces pushed southward towards Pyongyang. UN forces oversaw the evacuation of refugees as they retreated from Pyongyang in December 1950.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pyongyang taken as UN retreats, 1950 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/pyongyang-taken-as-un-retreats/znhynrd |access-date=2021-08-21 |website=BBC Archive |language=en |archive-date=21 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210821095028/https://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/pyongyang-taken-as-un-retreats/znhynrd |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1952, it was the target of the largest aerial raid of the entire war, involving 1,400 UN aircraft.

Already during the war, plans were made to reconstruct the city. On 27 July 1953 – the day the armistice between North Korea and South Korea was signed – ''The Pyongyang Review'' wrote: "While streets were in flames, an exhibition showing the general plan of restoration of Pyongyang was held at the Moranbong Underground Theater", the air raid shelter of the government under [[Moranbong]].

The [[Death and state funeral of Kim Il Sung|funeral of Kim Il Sung]] was held in Pyongyang in 1994.

In 2001, North Korean authorities began a long-term modernisation programme. The Ministry of Capital City Construction Development was included in the [[Cabinet of North Korea|Cabinet]] in that year. In 2006, Kim Jong Il's brother-in-law [[Jang Song-thaek|Jang Song Thaek]] took charge of the ministry.

Throughout the rule of [[Kim Jong Un]] a number of residential projects were constructed.

==Geography==
Pyongyang is in the west-central part of North Korea; the city lies on a flat plain about {{convert|50|km|0}} east of the [[Korea Bay]], an arm of the [[Yellow Sea]]. The [[Taedong River]] flows southwestward through the city toward the Korea Bay. The Pyongyang plain, where the city is situated, is one of the two large plains on the Western coast of the Korean peninsula, the other being the Chaeryong plain. Both have an area of approximately 500 square kilometers.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=63}}

The transition from the cold, dry winter to the warm, wet summer occurs rather quickly between April and early May, and there is a similarly abrupt return to winter conditions in late October and November. Summers are generally hot and humid, with the [[East Asian monsoon]] taking place from June until September; these are also the hottest months, with average temperatures of {{cvt|21|to|25|°C}}, and daytime highs often above {{cvt|30|°C}}. Although largely transitional seasons, spring and autumn experience more pleasant weather, with average high temperatures ranging from {{cvt|20 to 26|°C}} in May and {{cvt|22 to 27|°C}} in September,<ref>{{cite web |title=Average Weather in May in Pyongyang, North Korea - Weather Spark |url=https://weatherspark.com/m/141759/5/Average-Weather-in-May-in-Pyongyang-North-Korea |access-date=2020-08-23 |website=weatherspark.com |archive-date=24 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201024083206/https://weatherspark.com/m/141759/5/Average-Weather-in-May-in-Pyongyang-North-Korea |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Average Weather in September in Pyongyang, North Korea - Weather Spark |url=https://weatherspark.com/m/141759/9/Average-Weather-in-September-in-Pyongyang-North-Korea |access-date=2020-08-23 |website=weatherspark.com |archive-date=24 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201024164909/https://weatherspark.com/m/141759/9/Average-Weather-in-September-in-Pyongyang-North-Korea |url-status=live }}</ref> coupled with relatively clear, sunny skies.<ref>{{cite web |title=Average Weather in Pyongyang, North Korea, Year Round - Weather Spark |url=https://weatherspark.com/y/141759/Average-Weather-in-Pyongyang-North-Korea-Year-Round#Sections-Clouds |access-date=2020-08-23 |website=weatherspark.com |archive-date=26 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201026025723/https://weatherspark.com/y/141759/Average-Weather-in-Pyongyang-North-Korea-Year-Round#Sections-Clouds |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Average Weather in Pyongyang, North Korea, Year Round - Weather Spark |url=https://weatherspark.com/y/141759/Average-Weather-in-Pyongyang-North-Korea-Year-Round#Sections-Precipitation |access-date=2020-08-23 |website=weatherspark.com |archive-date=26 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201026025723/https://weatherspark.com/y/141759/Average-Weather-in-Pyongyang-North-Korea-Year-Round#Sections-Precipitation |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Politics==
[[File:Mansudae Assembly Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Mansudae Assembly Hall]], seat of the [[Supreme People's Assembly]], the North Korean parliament]]
Major government and other public offices are located in Pyongyang, which is constitutionally designated as the country's capital.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=196}} The [[Government Complex No. 1, Pyongyang|seat]] of the [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea|Workers' Party Central Committee]] and the Pyongyang People's Committee are located in Haebangsan-dong, [[Chung-guyok]]. The [[Cabinet of North Korea]] is located in Jongro-dong, [[Chung-guyok]].

Pyongyang is also the seat of all major North Korean security institutions. The largest of them, the [[Ministry of Social Security (North Korea)|Ministry of Social Security]], has 130,000 employees working in 12 bureaus. These oversee activities including: police services, security of party officials, classified documents, census, civil registrations, large-scale public construction, [[traffic control]], fire safety, [[civil defence]], [[public health]] and [[customs]].{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|pp=276–277}} Another significant structure based in the city is the [[Ministry of State Security (North Korea)|Ministry of State Security]], whose 30,000 personnel manage intelligence, political prison systems, military industrial security and entry and exit management.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=277}}

The politics and management of the city is dominated by the [[Workers' Party of Korea]], as they are in the national level. The city is managed by the Pyongyang Party Committee of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] and its chairman is the ''de facto'' [[mayor]]. The supreme standing state organ is the Pyongyang People's Committee, responsible
for everyday events in support of the city. This includes following local Party guidance as channeled through the Pyongyang Party Committee, the distribution of resources prioritised to Pyongyang, and providing support to KWP and internal security agency personnel and families.

==Administrative status and divisions==
P'yŏngyang is divided into 19 wards (''ku-'' or ''guyŏk'') ''(the city proper)'', 2 counties (''kun'' or ''gun''), and 1 [[Dong (administrative division)|neighborhood]] (''dong'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nk.chosun.com/map/map.html?ACT=geo_01 |script-title=ko:행정구역현황 |title=Haengjeong Guyeok Hyeonhwang |work=NK Chosun |access-date=10 January 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109202822/http://nk.chosun.com/map/map.html?ACT=geo_01 |archive-date=9 January 2006}} Also [http://www.xzqh.org/waiguo/asia/1002.htm Administrative divisions of North Korea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041018022439/http://www.xzqh.org/waiguo/asia/1002.htm |date=18 October 2004 }} (used as reference for hanja)</ref>

==Cityscape==
{{Wide image|Pyongyangpanoramic.jpg|2000px|Panorama of Pyongyang, as seen from the ''Juche'' Tower in April 2012|alt=A panoramic view of Pyongyang from atop the ''Juche'' tower}}
After being destroyed during the Korean War, Pyongyang was entirely rebuilt according to Kim Il Sung's vision, which was to create a capital that would boost morale in the post-war years.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=91,93–94}} The result was a city with wide, tree-lined [[boulevard]]s and public buildings with terraced landscaping, [[mosaic]]s and decorated ceilings.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=91}} Its Soviet-style architecture makes it reminiscent of a [[Siberia]]n city during winter snowfall, although edifices of traditional Korean design somewhat soften this perception. In summer, it is notable for its rivers, willow trees, flowers and parkland.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=91}}

Since the end of the [[Korean War]] the city was planned strictly according to [[Socialism|Socialist]] principles.<ref name="Dongwoo">{{cite web|url=https://www.archpaper.com/2017/08/pyongyang-urban-planning-development/|title=A brief urban history of Pyongyang, North Korea—and how it might develop under capitalism|author=Dongwoo Yim|publisher=The Architect's Newspaper|date=2017-08-24|accessdate=2024-02-29}}</ref> According to the 1953 masterplan designed [[Kim Jung-hee]] the city was planned to reach one-million residents stretching from the [[Taedong River]] to the [[Pothong River]]. The city center was planned as the main administrative district with  main landscape structures constructed in between districts and are used as buffer zones so that they cannot expand freely.<ref name="Dongwoo" /> The city center was planned with wide avenues and streets and monumental structures and forms the central administrative district where many government and public buildings are located including the [[Government Complex No. 1, Pyongyang|Forbidden City]] as well as various monuments and memorials, which together form an important axis of symbolic places which promotes the [[Ideology of the Workers' Party of Korea]] and [[North Korean cult of personality]] around [[Kim family (North Korea)|Kim family]] with the epicentre and [[Kilometre zero]] of the central district located at [[Kim Il Sung Square]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lonely highways: On the road in Kim Jong Un's North Korea |last=Talmadge |first=Eric |website=[[Associated Press]] |agency=AP |date=20 November 2017 |access-date=5 December 2021 |url= https://apnews.com/article/republic-of-kim-a-road-less-traveled-1589490035 }}</ref>

The 1953 masterplan set the basic layout from which the city's development was derived in the next decades with a unit district system which mixes residential and industrial zoning. Those districts are spread around the central administrative district and together with it they form the key axis of directionality for the city expansion. While in the 50s the major emphasis was placed on the reconstruction of Pyongyang from its ruins as carefully a socialist city in strict line with the masterplan, the 60s and 70s saw new wave of development which included expansion of the central boulevards, construction of high-density apartment buildings along the central boulevards, grandiose civic and cultural buildings and monumental statues and squares. This tendency included also the inclusion of traditional [[Korean architecture]] for some buildings. While the development generally followed the 1953 master plan, it diverted from it in some aspects, such as the construction of high-rises along the central avenues, a step conflicted with the 1953 plan which called for more even distribution of the residential construction throughout the city in several multi-cores.<ref name="Dongwoo" /> The 90s saw a relative slowdown in the development of the urban structure due to the deep economic crisis and [[North Korean famine|famine]] which swept through North Korea and led to the [[Songun|diversion of resources to the army]]. The 2010s and 2020s saw renewed efforts in urbanization and increasing density with the reconstruction of streets and avenues located further from the center and transformation of former rural parts of the city into high density residential districts.

[[File:Pyongyang-Highrise-Buildings-2014.jpg|thumb|Apartment buildings with green areas]]

The streets are laid out in a north–south, east–west grid, giving the city an orderly appearance.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=91}} North Korean designers applied the Swedish experience of self-sufficient urban neighbourhoods throughout the entire country, and Pyongyang is no exception. Its inhabitants are mostly divided into administrative units of 5,000 to 6,000 people (''dong''). These units all have similar sets of amenities including a food store, a barber shop, a [[tailor]], a public bathhouse, a [[post office]], a clinic, a library and others. Many residents occupy high-rise apartment buildings.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=97}} One of Kim Il Sung's priorities while designing Pyongyang was to limit the population. Authorities maintain a restrictive regime of movement into the city, making it atypical of [[East Asia]] as it is silent, uncrowded and spacious.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=91-92}}

Structures in Pyongyang are divided into three major architectural categories: monuments, buildings with traditional Korean motifs and high-rises.<ref name="LCCS93">{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+kp0053) |title=Architecture and City Planning |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |access-date=24 April 2015 |archive-date=9 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109103302/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+kp0053) |url-status=live }}</ref> Some of North Korea's most recognisable landmarks are monuments, like the [[Juche Tower|''Juche'' Tower]], the [[Arch of Triumph (Pyongyang)|Arch of Triumph]] and the [[Mansu Hill Grand Monument]].

Pyongyang served as the provincial capital of [[South Pyongan Province]] until 1946,<ref name="EncyKorea Pyongyang">{{cite web |url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=298139&v=44 |script-title=ko:평양시 平壤市 |trans-title=Pyongyang |publisher=Nate/Encyclopedia of Korean Culture |language=ko |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610080045/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=298139&v=44 |archive-date=10 June 2011}}</ref> and Pyongyang cuisine shares the general culinary tradition of the Pyongan province. The most famous local food is ''[[Pyongyang naengmyeon|Pyongyang raengmyŏn]]'', or also called ''mul raengmyŏn'' or just simply ''raengmyŏn''. ''Raengmyŏn'' literally means "cold noodles", while the affix ''mul'' refers to water because the dish is served in a cold broth. ''Raengmyŏn'' consists of thin and chewy buckwheat noodles in a cold meat-broth with ''[[dongchimi]]'' (watery kimchi) and topped with a slice of sweet [[Korean pear]].

Pyongyang ''raengmyŏn'' was originally eaten in homes built with ''[[ondol]]'' (traditional [[underfloor heating]]) during the cold winter, so it is also called ''"Pyongyang deoldeori"'' (shivering in Pyongyang). Pyongyang locals sometimes enjoyed it as a ''[[haejangguk]]'', which is any type of food eaten as a hangover cure, usually a warm soup.<ref name="Korean Portal">{{cite web |url=http://www.knowledge.go.kr/jsp/theme/themeView.jsp?themeIdx=2872&dir=al&page=4&searchOption=all&searchValue= |script-title=ko:닮은 듯 색다른 매력을 간직한 북한의 음식 문화 |publisher=Korea Knowledge Portal |date=19 June 2009 |language=ko |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009165958/http://www.knowledge.go.kr/jsp/theme/themeView.jsp?themeIdx=2872&dir=al&page=4&searchOption=all&searchValue= |archive-date=9 October 2011 |df=dmy-all}}
</ref>

Another representative Pyongyang dish, ''[[Taedonggang sungeoguk]]'', translates as "flathead grey mullet soup from the [[Taedong River]]". The soup features [[flathead grey mullet]] (abundant in the Taedong River) along with black peppercorns and salt.<ref>{{cite news |script-title=ko:'오마니의 맛' 관심 |trans-title=Attention to "Mother's taste" |newspaper=[[The Chosun Ilbo]] |last=Ju |first=Wan-jung (주완중) |language=ko |date=12 June 2000}}</ref> Traditionally, it has been served to guests visiting Pyongyang. Therefore, there is a common saying, "How good was the trout soup?", which is used to greet people returning from Pyongyang. Another local specialty, ''Pyongyang onban'' (literally "warm rice of Pyongyang") comprises freshly cooked rice topped with sliced mushrooms, chicken, and a couple of ''[[bindaetteok]]'' (pancakes made from ground mung beans and vegetables).<ref name="Korean Portal" />

[[File:Laika ac Pyongyang (7975203722).jpg|thumb|right|Central Pyongyang with the newly built Changjon Apartment Complex. The [[Okryu Bridge]] and [[Ryugyong Hotel]] are in the background]]
Pyongyang is North Korea's industrial center.<ref name="EBPyongyang"/> Thanks to the abundance of natural resources like [[coal]], [[iron]] and [[limestone]], as well as good land and water transport systems, it was the first industrial city to emerge in North Korea after the Korean War. Light and heavy industries are both present and have developed in parallel. Heavy manufactures include [[cement]], industrial ceramics,<ref name="britannica.com"/> munitions and weapons, but mechanical engineering remains the core industry. Light industries in Pyongyang and its vicinity include [[textiles]], footwear and food, among others.<ref name="britannica.com"/> Special emphasis is put on the production and supply of fresh produce and subsidiary crops in farms on the city's outskirts. Other crops include [[rice]], [[maize|sweetcorn]] and [[soybeans]]. Pyongyang aims to achieve self-sufficiency in meat production. High-density facilities raise pigs, chicken and other livestock.<ref name="EBPyongyang"/>

Until the late 2010s Pyongyang still experienced frequent shortages of electricity.<ref name="IFES1">{{cite web |url=http://ifes.kyungnam.ac.kr/eng/FRM/FRM_0101V.aspx?code=FRM141219_0001 |title=Ten Power Plants on Chongchon River under Construction to Increase Power Supply to Pyongyang |publisher=Institute for Far Eastern Studies |date=19 December 2014 |access-date=20 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427143900/http://ifes.kyungnam.ac.kr/eng/FRM/FRM_0101V.aspx?code=FRM141219_0001 |archive-date=27 April 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> To solve this problem, two power stations – Huichon Power Stations 1 and 2 – were built in [[Chagang Province]] and supply the city through direct transmission lines. A second phase of the power expansion project was launched in January 2013, consisting of a series of small dams along the [[Chongchon River]]. The first two power stations have a maximum generating capacity of 300 megawatts (MW), while the 10 dams to be built under second phase are expected to generate about 120 MW.<ref name="IFES1"/> In addition, the city has several existing or planned [[thermal power station]]s. These include Pyongyang TPS with a capacity of 500 MW, East Pyongyang TPS with a capacity of 50 MW, and Kangdong TPS which is under construction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://38north.org/2014/11/cmelvin112514/ |title=Pyongyang's Perpetual Power Problems |work=[[38 North]] |date=25 November 2014 |access-date=20 April 2015 |archive-date=19 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319114254/http://38north.org/2014/11/cmelvin112514/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The city also has Hwanggumbol Shop, a chain of state-owned convenience stores supplying goods at prices cheaper than those in the [[jangmadang]] markets.
