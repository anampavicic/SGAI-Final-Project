'''St. Catharines''' is the most populous city in Canada's [[Regional Municipality of Niagara|Niagara Region]], the eighth largest urban area in the province of [[Ontario]]. As of 2017, St. Catharines has an area of {{convert|96.13|km2|mi2}} and 140,370 residents. It lies in [[Southern Ontario]], {{convert|51|km|mi}} south of [[Toronto]] across [[Lake Ontario]], and is {{convert|19|km|mi}} inland from the [[Canada–United States border|international boundary with the United States]] along the [[Niagara River]]. It is the northern entrance of the [[Welland Canal]]. [[List of people from St. Catharines|Residents of St. Catharines]] are known as ''St. Catharinites''. St. Catharines carries the official nickname "The Garden City" due to its 1,000 acres (4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of parks, gardens, and trails.

St. Catharines is between the [[Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area]] (GTHA) and the Canada–U.S. border at [[Fort Erie, Ontario|Fort Erie]]. Manufacturing was the city's dominant industry, as noted by the heraldic motto, "Industry and Liberality". [[General Motors Canada|General Motors of Canada, Ltd.]], the Canadian subsidiary of [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], was the city's largest employer, a distinction now held by the [[District School Board of Niagara]]. THK Rhythm Automotive, formerly [[TRW Automotive|TRW]], operates a plant in the city, although in recent years, employment there has shifted from [[heavy industry]] and manufacturing to services.

St. Catharines lies on one of the main telecommunications [[internet backbone|backbones]] between Canada and the United States, and as a result a number of call centres operate in the city. It is designated an Urban Growth Centre by the [[Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe]], intended to achieve a minimum density target of 150 jobs and residents combined per hectare by 2032 or earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://placestogrow.ca/images/pdfs/ggh2017/en/growth%20plan%20%282017%29.pdf|title=Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe 2017|website=placestogrow.ca|access-date=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406152024/http://placestogrow.ca/images/pdfs/ggh2017/en/growth%20plan%20%282017%29.pdf|archive-date=6 April 2018}}</ref>

St. Catharines is also home to [[Brock University]]. 

==History==
=== Early history ===
The [[Iroquoian]] speaking [[Chonnonton]] peoples who were also known as the "people of the deer" lived in the region. The Chonnonton would grow vegetables like corn, beans, and squash while living in [[longhouses]]. In 1647 the [[Seneca people|Seneca]] conquered Chonnonton villages from east of the Niagara River. The [[Haudenosaunee]] then destroyed the villages in the 1650s. After these attacks and smallpox epidemics, the Chonnontons disappeared completely, with the last recorded appearance of them in 1671 by French explorers.<ref name="The Canadian Encyclopedia 2022">{{cite web | title=St. Catharines | website=The Canadian Encyclopedia | date=2022-03-30 | url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/st-catharines#:~:text=Indigenous%20Peoples,the%20Grand%20and%20Niagara%20rivers. | access-date=2023-05-26}}</ref>

St. Catharines falls within the original territory of the [[Mississaugas]]. A treaty signed in 1782 between the Mississaugas and the British government ceded a large tract of land, which included the St. Catharines area, to the Crown for the purpose of European settlement.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shanahan |first1=David |title=Between the Lakes Treaty |url=https://anishinabeknews.ca/2019/12/07/between-the-lakes-treaty/ |website=Anishinabek News |access-date=7 January 2023}}</ref> St. Catharines was settled by [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] in the 1780s. The Crown granted land in compensation for services and for losses in the United States. Early histories credit the Loyalists Serjeant Jacob Dittrick and Private John Hainer as among the first settlers to come to the area in 1790.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Boyle |first1=Terry |title=Memories of Ontario : a Traveller's Guide to the Towns & Cities of Western Ontario |date=1991 |publisher=Cannon Books |isbn=9780969525110 |page=163}}</ref> They took their Crown Patents, where Dick's Creek and 12 Mile Creek merge, which is now the city centre of St. Catharines. Historians have speculated that Dick's Creek was named after [[Richard Pierpoint]], a [[Black Loyalist]] and former American slave, from an oral history account and events that had taken place around that time that would be consistent with him being the source of the name.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hughes |first1=Alun |title=RICHARD PIERPOINT AND THE NAMING OF DICK'S CREEK |url=https://brocku.ca/social-sciences/geography/wp-content/uploads/sites/152/Richard-Pierpoint-and-the-Naming-of-Dick%E2%80%99s-Creek.pdf |website=Brock University |access-date=15 July 2022}}</ref> Secondary to water routes, indigenous trails provided transportation networks, which resulted in the nearby radial road patterns.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jackson |first1=John |title=The Welland Canals and Their Communities |date=1997 |publisher=[[University of Toronto]] |isbn=9780802009333 |page=123 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-sI64yldu4C |access-date=2 August 2022}}</ref> The surrounding land was surveyed, and ownships were created between 1787 and 1789.<ref>{{cite report|url=https://www.stcatharines.ca/en/Building-and-Renovating/resources/Documents/Yates-Street-District-Study.PDF|page=12|date=1994|title=Yales Street and Area District Conservation District Study|publisher=City of St. Catharines}}</ref>

After the [[Butler's Rangers]] disbanded in 1784 and settled the area, Duncan Murray, as a former quartermaster in the [[84th Regiment of Foot (Royal Highland Emigrants)]], was appointed by the Crown to distribute free government supplies (victuals) for two years to the resettled Loyalists.<ref>National Archives of Canada RG 19 Vol 4447 Parcel 3</ref> He did this from his mill, built on the 12 Mile Creek in [[Power Glen, Ontario|Power Glen]]. After his death in 1786, his holdings were forfeited to the merchant Robert Hamilton of Queenston, who tried to operate for profit the well-established Murray's Distribution Centre and Mill under the management of his cousin. Among other ventures, Hamilton became land wealthy by expropriating lands from subsistence Loyalist settlers who were incapable of settling their debts.<ref>Wilson, Bruce (1983). ''The Enterprises of Robert Hamilton''</ref> Murray's distribution centre, later Hamilton's warehouse, and its location have long been a mystery. Hamilton's major profits were derived from transhipping supplies for the military and civic establishments from his [[Queenston]] enterprise, not from charitably supplying the subsistence Loyalist settlers. Hamilton lacked interest in social development<ref>Wilson, Bruce (2000){{cite web |url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=2447&&PHPSESSID=elh9h7koc2m9fno702vclrpbb2 |title=Hamilton, Robert |access-date=2010-11-26 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017062529/http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=2447&&PHPSESSID=elh9h7koc2m9fno702vclrpbb2 |archive-date=17 October 2012 }}</ref> and sold his business to Jesse Thompson before the turn of the 19th century.

The Merritt family arrived after this time and was among the later Loyalists to relocate after the American Revolution. They were from the [[Carolinas]], [[New York State]], and [[New Brunswick]]. In 1796, Thomas Merritt arrived to build on his relationship with his former Commander and [[Queen's Rangers|Queen's Ranger]], [[John Graves Simcoe]], who was now the [[Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada]].<ref name=":0">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/biographyhonwhm00merrgoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/biographyhonwhm00merrgoog/page/n28 6]|title=Biography of the Hon.

The canal established St. Catharines as the hub of commerce and industry for the [[Niagara Peninsula]]. Merritt played a role in making St. Catharines a centre of [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] activity. In 1855, the [[British Methodist Episcopal Church, Salem Chapel]]; was established at the corner of Geneva and North Streets on land granted to the congregation by Merritt in the early 1840s. The area became known to refugee slaves from the United States as a place of "refuge and rest;" it was a destination, one of the final stops in Canada on the [[Underground Railroad]] for African-American refugees fleeing slavery.

At an unknown early date, an inn was built by Thomas Adams on the east side of what is now Ontario Street. It became a community meeting place, election centre, stagecoach stop, and mail delivery deposit. That had been preceded by the church and a log school house completed before 1797,<ref>Ontario Historical Society, Papers & Records Vol. XXXVI (1975), "The Petition of John Hainer and Jacob Dittrick, page 201" and Upper Land Petitions " H " Bundle 3, 1797 (National Archives of Canada RG1 L3 Vol. 224)</ref> all on the east bank of the 12 Mile Creek, at the extreme west end of what was then known as Main Street. It was an extension of the old [[Iroquois Trail]] and was renamed St. Paul Street by the settlers and their descendants by the mid-19th century. Later, several mills, salt works, numerous retail outlets, a ship building yard, distillery, and various other businesses were developed.

Incorporated as a village in 1845, St. Catharines had a population of about 3,500 in 1846. The primary industry was flour milling. Other industry included ship repairs, four grist mills, a brewery, three distilleries, a tannery, a foundry, a machine, and a pump factory. There were a variety of tradesmen, three bank agencies, and eight taverns. Stage coaches offered service to other towns and villages. There were already six churches or chapels, a post office that received mail daily, a grammar school, and a weekly newspaper.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

Summer thunderstorms are commonplace but generally less prevalent and less severe than farther west in southern Ontario due to the diminishing effect of the surrounding lakes.

The complex and extensive glacial history of the [[Niagara Peninsula]] has resulted in similarly complex soil [[stratigraphy]] in the area occupied by the city today. St. Catharines was once at the base of a glacial lake known as [[Glacial Lake Iroquois]], which deposited thick layers of clay between the Escarpment and Lake Ontario. As a result of these factors, the city's soil is particularly conducive to fruit growing and is capable of producing grapes that are used to make wines. Three wineries operate in the city's west end: [[Henry of Pelham Winery]], Hernder Estates and Harvest Estates.

Since the opening of the first Welland Canal in 1829, the city has had four different canal systems, whether modified or newly constructed, carved into its geographical landscape. The fourth and present-day canal forms the majority of the city's eastern boundary. The first three of the city's canals have largely been buried, portions of it beside the present-day [[Ontario Highway 406|Highway 406]] and near Lake Street and the QEW highway. Other remnants of the original canals can still be seen in various locations throughout the city; many remains are hidden within forested areas designated as city parks. Some residents in the region are interested in restoring the original routing of the Welland Canal through the city. They intend that the restored waterway and locks would be open to a new tourist attraction within the city.

St. Catharines was affected by the [[Blizzard of 1977]], an event which resulted in more than 150&nbsp;cm of snow, wind that travelled the speed of 110&nbsp;km/h, and a wind chill of approximately -45 degrees Celsius. The [[Queen Elizabeth Way]] (QEW) was closed and a state of emergency was declared. The [[Canadian Armed Forces]] was involved in rescue efforts.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Roy |first1=Cathy |title=Niagara's recent storm kindles memories of Blizzard of '77 |url=https://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/local-niagara-falls/opinion/2022/01/27/niagara-s-recent-storm-kindles-memories-of-blizzard-of-77.html |website=St. Catharines Standard |date=27 January 2022 |publisher=Niagara This Week |access-date=15 August 2022}}</ref>

=== Communities ===
St. Catharines' development history has resulted in a number of unique and distinct communities within the city. The historical area of St. Catharines consisted of nothing more than what is now the downtown core, with the remaining land being part of [[Louth, Ontario|Louth Township]] on the west and [[Grantham, Ontario|Grantham Township]] on the east. St. Catharines continued to steadily grow through the late 19th and early 20th centuries, eventually annexing land to the southwest that would become [[Western Hill, Ontario|Western Hill]] and Old [[Glenridge, Ontario|Glenridge]], and to the east and north that would collectively become the central part of St. Catharines. In addition to the growth of St. Catharines, the town of [[Merritton]] and the town of [[Port Dalhousie, Ontario|Port Dalhousie]] existed as separate municipalities to the south and north of the city, each slowly growing their own residential base.

Along with the rest of Ontario, St. Catharines experienced explosive growth after World War II. St. Catharines continued to annex Grantham Township as development continued, including the large swaths of land to the north known now as "[[North End St. Catharines|The North End]]". St. Catharines would also absorb Merritton and Port Dalhousie in 1961, making them part of the city. During this time, St. Catharines nearly tripled in population.

With the formation of the [[Regional Municipality of Niagara]] in 1970, the portion of Louth Township east of Fifteen Mile Creek was transferred to the City of St. Catharines. This included the eastern portion of the Hamlet of [[Rockway, Ontario|Rockway]], as well as the Hamlet of [[Power Glen, Ontario|Power Glen]]. The few remaining portions of Grantham Township in the Northeast corner of the area, including [[Port Weller, Ontario|Port Weller]], were also transferred to the city. With the new Louth Township lands belonging to the city, St. Catharines would begin two developments in the west end&nbsp;— Martindale Road in 1983, and Vansickle Road in 1987. These developments are nearing completion. There was also a push to continue further expansion to the west in the late 1990s, but this has since been halted by [[Greenbelt (Golden Horseshoe)|Ontario Greenbelt]] legislation.

Numerous efforts have been made to improve the downtown; the restructuring of manufacturing resulted in a loss of jobs and retail businesses. In the early 21st century, city, university, and private developers undertook several initiatives to revive downtown, related to urban design, clustering activities to attract people to the area as a destination from day through evening events.

In 2006, city council approved converting one-way arteries through the city centre to allow for two-way traffic, to make it easier for people to make their way around the city to explore it. In terms of urban planning and use, two-way traffic improves circulation within the area. The city wanted to improve downtown as a destination, rather than a place to pass through. The council also want to have downtown St. Catharines on the Wine Route, a driving tour of Niagara wineries and an Ontario Wine Council initiative to boost the number of visitors to the region's many wineries.<ref name="stcatharinesstandard">{{cite web |url=http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1661692&archive=true|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120910150042/http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1661692&archive=true|url-status=dead |archive-date=10 September 2012|title=City makes pitch to have wine route redirected ... &#124; St. Catharines Standard |publisher=stcatharinesstandard.ca|access-date=15 April 2016}}</ref> The Wine Route was modified to officially redirect winery goers through the downtown starting in 2012.<ref name="stcatharinesstandard2">{{cite web |url=http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2762335&archive=true |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120918133804/http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2762335&archive=true|url-status=dead |archive-date=September 18, 2012|title=Wine route is moving downtown &#124; St. Catharines Standard  |publisher=stcatharinesstandard.ca|access-date=April 15, 2016}}</ref> The first phase of two-way traffic was completed in 2009, with St. Paul and King streets being converted.

In 2009, $54&nbsp;million in joint federal, provincial and municipal funding was announced for the construction of a performing arts centre in the city's core, officially opened in September 2015 as the [[FirstOntario Performing Arts Centre]]. Complementing the centre, which features concert, dance and film venues, is [[Brock University]]'s Marilyn I. Walker School of Fine and Performing Arts. The university renovated the former Canada Hair Cloth Building to use for the school. This former industrial building is behind St. Paul Street and next to the municipal performing arts centre.<ref name="stcatharinesstandard3">{{cite web|url=http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1579849&archive=true|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130115174638/http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1579849&archive=true|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 January 2013|title=Funding announced for downtown performing arts ... &#124; St. Catharines Standard|author=nurun.com|publisher=stcatharinesstandard.ca|access-date=15 April 2016}}</ref>

In late 2011, city council approved moving forward with the construction of a new spectator facility to replace the crumbling [[Garden City Arena Complex]], built in 1938. Council voted to build a U-shaped facility, which will be home to the Niagara IceDogs, an Ontario Hockey League team, and be able to host other events, such as concerts. It would have room for 4,500 to 5,300 spectators. The goal is to keep the cost of the facility at or below $50 million and to build it on a swath of land known locally as the lower-level parking lot, behind St. Paul Street and abutting Highway 406.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://niagara.localsportsreport.com/News/st-catharines-approves-new-spectator-facility |title=St. Catharines approves new spectator facility

The city has made other infrastructure improvements to the downtown. In January 2012, a new edition of the Carlisle Street Parking Garage opened. It was built to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standards and was certified for its environmentally friendly features, including a [[green roof]], preferred carpool and [[hybrid vehicle]] parking, greywater collection, permeable interlocking brick pavement, and several bike racks for users. A mixed-use development, the structure was planned for retail space at street level on Carlisle Street, in order to promote activity and business on the street. The project cost $27.9&nbsp;million, with funding split three ways between the federal, provincial and municipal governments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stcatharines.ca//uploads/doc_634614445022357173.pdf |title=Put it in park in the new Carlisle Street Parking Garage |access-date=2011-11-15 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714133032/http://www.stcatharines.ca//uploads/doc_634614445022357173.pdf |archive-date=14 July 2014 }}</ref> Starting in 2019, certain streets located in downtown St. Catharines have been closed during weekends to vehicle traffic.

== Sports ==
===Ice hockey===
St. Catharines entered into the [[Ontario Hockey Association]] Junior 'A' Hockey in 1943 as the [[St. Catharines Falcons (1943–1947)|St. Catharines Falcons]]. In 1947, they became the Teepees and were affiliated with the [[American Hockey League]]'s [[Buffalo Bisons (AHL)|Buffalo Bisons]]. When the [[National Hockey League]]'s (NHL) [[Chicago Blackhawks]] made the Bisons their number one farm team, they inherited the Teepees. In the 1960s, the Jr. 'A' team went deeply into debt to the Chicago Black Hawks, but continued as a successful franchise and were named the St. Catharines Black Hawks. The [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] Fincups moved to St. Catharines in 1976 and played here for one year before moving back to Hamilton. The AHL [[St. Catharines Saints]] played in St. Catharines between 1982 and 1986, before being forced to re-locate to [[Newmarket, Ontario|Newmarket]] due to protests from the NHL [[Buffalo Sabres]]. The St. Catharines Saints served as the [[farm team]] for the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], and today are known as the [[Toronto Marlies]].

In 2007, the [[Ontario Hockey League|OHL]]'s [[Mississauga IceDogs]] relocated to St. Catharines and became the [[Niagara IceDogs]]. The IceDogs played out of the [[Jack Gatecliff Arena]], which was renamed the Gatorade Garden City Complex (since renamed [[Garden City Arena Complex]]). In 2014, the IceDogs moved to the newly built [[Meridian Centre]].
Since starting out the team has won the [[Emms Trophy]] in 2010–2011 & 2018–2019. They have also won the [[Bobby Orr Trophy]] during 2011–2012 season and 2015–2016 season, qualifying for the OHL Finals. They would be beaten both times by the [[London Knights]]. The team has had numerous NHL alumni including [[Alex Pietrangelo]], [[Dougie Hamilton]], [[Vince Dunn]], [[Ryan Strome]], [[Akil Thomas]] and [[Mark Visentin]].

The current [[St. Catharines Falcons (1968)|St. Catharines Falcons]] team plays in the Golden Horseshoe Division of the [[Greater Ontario Junior Hockey League]]. The team has played since 1968 and plays all home games out of the Jack Gatecliff Arena. The team were runners up for the [[Sutherland Cup]] in 1979, 1990, 1994, 1997, 2000 and 2014, but won the cup in 2012.

=== Basketball ===
In 2015, the [[National Basketball League of Canada]] announced that Niagara had been awarded a new franchise to play in the Meridian Centre. The team, named the [[Niagara River Lions]], began play in [[2015–16 NBL Canada season|2015]] where they reached the conference quarterfinals. The team joined the [[Canadian Elite Basketball League]] after the [[2017–18 NBL Canada season|2017–18 season]]. In 2021, the River Lions had one of their best seasons, finishing 2nd with a 10–4 record. The River Lions made it through the playoffs into the finals, where they lost 65–101 to the [[Edmonton Stingers]]. In 2024, the River Lions Captured their 1st CEBL Championship with a 97-95 win over the Vancouver Bandits. The River Lions finished 14-6 led by a perfect 11-0 Home record.

===Baseball===
The city was the home of the [[New York–Penn League]]'s [[St. Catharines Blue Jays]], the Short-season A affiliate of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], from 1986 to 1999. In 1996 the team was renamed the [[St. Catharines Stompers]], and was subsequently sold and relocated to [[Queens]], New York City in late 1999, where they became the [[Queens Kings]].

===Rugby===
St. Catharines Tigers RFC was formed in 1978. Beginning in 2015, the Tigers joined the Niagara Wasps RFC and play at their field in Thorold.

===Soccer===

===Rowing===
[[File:Martindale pond.jpg|thumb|Martindale Pond next to Martindale Road in St. Catharines, Ontario]]
Martindale Pond in St. Catharines' [[Port Dalhousie]] is the site of the annual [[Royal Canadian Henley Regatta]], a world-class event that brings over 3,000 athletes from various nations to the city. The site hosted the [[Fédération Internationale des Sociétés d'Aviron|FISA]] [[World Rowing Championships]] in [[1970 World Rowing Championships|1970]] and in [[1999 World Rowing Championships|1999]]. More recently, the World Master's Rowing Championship was held at the Martindale Pond in the summer of 2010, with $500,000 (~${{Format price|{{Inflation|index=US-GDP|value=500000|start_year=2010}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US-GDP}}) in improvements to the facility such as: a weed harvester, new docking and a new timing system. There are currently talks to bring the Canadian Rowing Hall of Fame to St. Catharines sometime in the near future. The pond is also home to the [[St. Catharines rowing club]], [[Brock University]] rowing club, [[Ridley College (Ontario)|Ridley College]] rowing club and to the annual [[CSSRA Championships]], which draws hundreds of high school athletes from Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. The Martindale Pond or Henley, continues to hold its world-renowned status as a major rowing venue in the world. The rowing event in the [[Pan American Games]] were held in St. Catharines in 2015. Several Olympic medallists in rowing are from St. Catharines, including [[Melanie Kok]], [[Buffy-Lynne Williams|Buffy Williams]], and [[Dave Boyes]].

There are marinas at Port Dalhousie and Port Weller and a club that sails from Municipal Beach. The St. Catharines Marina is at Port Weller. The Port Dalhousie Pier Marina and the Port Dalhousie Yacht Club are at Port Dalhousie.

== Government ==
===Municipal===
[[File:St.-Catharines-Wards.png|right|thumb|225px|The six municipal wards of St. Catharines]]St. Catharines is governed by a mayor and city council of twelve city councillors, with two councillors representing each of the six municipal [[ward (politics)|ward]]s in the city. A city councillor is also elected by the council as a whole to serve as deputy mayor, who only fills the role should the elected mayor not be available. [[St. Catharines City Council]] meets every Monday and is open to participation by the community. Matters put forward are voted on by members of city council; the mayor presides over council debate and serves very much like the [[Speaker (politics)|speaker]], and as a result only votes in the case of a tie. After 2006, municipal elections will be in November every four years rather than the previous three. Unlike most cities its size, city councillors only serve on a part-time basis and continue with their non-political careers in the community. Only the mayor is elected to a full-time position. St. Catharines City Hall is downtown on Church Street. [[Tim Rigby (politician)|Tim Rigby]] was the Mayor of St. Catharines from 1997 to 2006; [[Brian McMullan]] was elected to succeed Rigby on 13 November 2006, and was sworn in on 4 December. He was re-elected in October 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2010/10/25/brian-mcmullan-takes-st-catharines-mayors-seat-with-decisive-victory |first=Marleen|last=Bergsma|title=Brian McMullan takes St. Catharines mayor's seat with decisive victory|date=25 October 2010 |work=St Catharines Standard|access-date=2014-02-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222145249/http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2010/10/25/brian-mcmullan-takes-st-catharines-mayors-seat-with-decisive-victory |archive-date=22 February 2014 }}</ref> On 27 October 2014, [[Walter Sendzik]] was elected mayor of St. Catharines<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sawchuck|first1=Bill|title=Sendzik seals the deal|url=http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2014/10/27/sendzik-seals-the-deal|agency=St. Catharines Standard|date=28 October 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806203420/http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2014/10/27/sendzik-seals-the-deal|archive-date=6 August 2016|access-date=18 July 2016}}</ref> and assumed office in December 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Walter|first1=Karena|title=Sendzik vows to bring "hometown pride" back to city|url=http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2014/12/01/live-inaugural-st-catharines-city-council-meeting|agency=St. Catharines Standard|date=1 December 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806184123/http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2014/12/01/live-inaugural-st-catharines-city-council-meeting|archive-date=6 August 2016}}</ref>

St. Catharines uses a [[council-manager government]], and as a result a [[chief administrative officer]] (CAO) is appointed by council to oversee the day-to-day operations of the city and its departments. The CAO, in effect, is the highest ranking municipal civil servant and has authority over the spending of municipal tax dollars. The CAO advises council on policy matters and acts as liaison between the administrative staff and elected officials. Some of the CAOs duties include assisting in the creation of the municipal budget, and ensuring that municipal funds are spent in a responsible manner. Residents of St. Catharines also elect six regional councillors to the [[Niagara Regional Council]] on an at-large basis. Unlike many other [[Regional Municipality|regional municipalities]] in Ontario, regional councillors do not sit on city council and instead only represent at the regional level. Four school board trustees for the [[District School Board of Niagara]] representing St. Catharines and [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]] are elected, as well as three trustees for the [[Niagara Catholic District School Board]], two for five of St. Catharines' wards, and one for [[Thorold, Ontario|Thorold]] and the Merriton Ward of St. Catharines. Regional councillors and school board trustees are elected at the same time, and on the same ballot, as the mayor and city councillors. St. Catharines has one of the lowest resident/representative ratios of any large city in Ontario. There are just under 7,000 people per elected municipal representative in St. Catharines, while [[Oshawa]] (a similar-sized city in Ontario) has one representative per 13,500 people. [[London, Ontario]], has one representative per 30,500 people and [[Toronto]] has one representative per 111,774 people. There has been discussion regarding a modification of the city/regional council arrangement, with the possibility of reducing city council to six full-time representatives and having the six regional councillors serve on city council. While there is growing support in the business community for such an arrangement, city council has been unreceptive to such ideas.

[[File:St Catharines, riding.png|thumb|right|Map depicting the St. Catharines electoral district in 2005]]
At the provincial level, [[St. Catharines (federal electoral district)|St. Catharines]] is well known for electing high-profile members of the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]. [[Jim Bradley (politician)|Jim Bradley]] was the [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|Member of Provincial Parliament]] for St. Catharines from 1977 until 2018 and was Ontario's longest serving MPP.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jim Bradley voted out after 41 years as MPP in St. Catharines |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/jim-bradley-ontario-election-st-catharines-1.4697606 |website=CBC News |access-date=16 July 2022}}</ref> [[Peter Kormos]], who represented the southern portions of the city as part of the [[Welland (electoral district)|Welland riding]], was a prominent Member of Provincial Parliament in the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]] caucus and served previously as Minister of Consumer and Commercial Relations in the [[Bob Rae]] government. From 1999 to 2003, during the premierships of [[Mike Harris]] and [[Ernie Eves]], St. Catharines was the only large city in Ontario to not have at least one government member representing the city, as the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]]-held ridings of [[Lincoln (federal electoral district)|Lincoln]] and [[St. Catharines—Brock]] were eliminated as a cost-saving measure. [[Robert Stanley Welch|Robert Welch]], a long-time [[Deputy Premier of Ontario]], represented the now-eliminated Lincoln and St. Catharines—Brock ridings throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.

===Federal===
Federally, [[St. Catharines (federal electoral district)|St. Catharines]] is one of the most [[bellwether]] of any riding in Canada, having only elected an opposition MP twice in its history. [[Chris Bittle]] is the current MP for St. Catharines and is a member of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], which currently forms Canada's government. The southern portion of the city is included as part of the [[Niagara Centre]] riding, and is represented by [[Vance Badawey]], a [[Liberal Party of Canada]] MP.<ref>{{cite web|last1=LaFleche|first1=Grant|title=Dykstra, Allen lose their seats|url=http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2015/10/20/dykstra-allen-loses-their-seats-but-nicholson-allison-withstand-the-red-tide|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021122555/http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2015/10/20/dykstra-allen-loses-their-seats-but-nicholson-allison-withstand-the-red-tide|url-status=dead|archive-date=21 October 2015|website=St. Catharines Standard|access-date=23 October 2015}}</ref> Most federal representatives from St. Catharines have maintained a low profile on either the government or opposition [[backbencher|backbenches]]. The exception was [[Gilbert Parent]], who served as [[Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada|Speaker of the House]] for seven years while [[Jean Chrétien]] was Prime Minister.

===Legal===
St. Catharines is the judicial seat of the Niagara North Judicial District of Ontario, Central South Region, which represents the northern half of the Niagara Region equivalent to historic [[Lincoln County, Ontario|Lincoln County]]. The Superior Court of Justice is on Church Street across from City Hall. A satellite court is in [[Grimsby, Ontario|Grimsby]]. The city forms "1 District" of the [[Niagara Regional Police Service]]. The NRPS headquarters are no longer on Church Street, having moved to Niagara Falls in a finally constructed new building with administrative offices and support services on Cushman Road.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Transportation ===
[[File:MTO building St Catharines.jpg|thumb|right|The Garden City Tower is the Ministry of Transportation headquarters, with the downtown transit terminal at ground level.]]

The most defining transportation icon of St. Catharines is the Welland Canal, a [[ship canal]] that runs 43.4 kilometres (27.0&nbsp;mi), passing through the city. Four of its locks are within city boundaries. The canal allows shipping vessels to traverse the 99.5-metre (326.5&nbsp;ft) drop in altitude from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario. The [[Garden City Skyway]] is a nearby bridge that facilitates vehicle traffic into the city.

The main access routes into and out of St. Catharines are served by two major [[freeway]]s. The [[Queen Elizabeth Way]] runs east (at 15-Mile Creek) to west (at [[Garden City Skyway]]) and [[Ontario Highway 406|Highway 406]] runs north (at QEW) to south (at St. David's Road). Prior to the construction of these freeways, St. Paul Street (former [[Highway 8 (Ontario)|Highway 8]], now [[Niagara Regional Road 81|Regional Road 81]]) and Hartzel Road (former [[Highway 58 (Ontario)|Highway 58]], now a city-maintained street) provided east–west and north–south access to the city.

Public transportation is served by the [[St. Catharines Transit|St. Catharines Transit Commission]], which operates bus routes throughout the city and neighbouring Thorold. All major routes converge at the St. Catharines Bus Terminal, which is downtown within the headquarters of the [[Ministry of Transportation (Ontario)|Ontario Ministry of Transportation]]. The central station is also served by [[Coach Canada]], with service to Toronto and Niagara Falls.

Though transportation by rail is becoming increasingly popular, the [[St. Catharines, Ontario railway station|St. Catharines train station]] is largely under-utilized, with car and bus travel being the dominant forms of transportation for the city. The station is in its original building, outside the downtown core (because of issues involving the crossing of 12-Mile Creek). It is served daily by [[Via Rail]] and [[Amtrak]] trains connecting it to [[Toronto]] and New York City. The provincial and federal government recently committed $385&nbsp;million each to [[GO Transit]] to aid in the development of their 10-Year Capital Expansion Plan, which includes an expansion bus line servicing the Niagara Region. Currently, regular GO Bus service exists to St. Catharines with a stop at Fairview Mall, allowing riders to travel either west toward Burlington or east toward Niagara Falls. A rail link with GO Transit operates during the summer months with plans for the city to be permanently linked via rail in the future.

[[St. Catharines/Niagara District Airport]] services [[general aviation]] as well as chartered [[Jet airliner|jetliner]] flights. The airport is served by charter flights from [[FlyGTA Airlines]] and offers charter flights to [[Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport]], Muskoka and Collingwood. It is near the city's east-end in neighbouring [[Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario|Niagara-on-the-Lake]]. Other airports surrounding the city include [[Niagara Falls/Niagara South Airport]] and [[Niagara Central Dorothy Rungeling Airport]]. The closest airports in proximity offering long-haul and international flights are [[John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport]], [[Niagara Falls International Airport]] and [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]].

St. Catharines had one of the first [[interurban]] electric [[streetcar]] routes, which ran between the city and [[Merritton, Ontario|Merritton]] and was eventually extended to [[Port Dalhousie, Ontario|Port Dalhousie]] in the north and [[Thorold, Ontario|Thorold]] to the south. Like most streetcar routes throughout the world, it was decommissioned in the 1960s, and the right-of-way has since been converted to parks and trails.

=== Secondary schools ===
{{See also|Education in Ontario}}
The [[District School Board of Niagara]] (DSBN), the local public school board, manages 6 secondary schools within St. Catharines: [[DSBN Academy]], [[Laura Secord Secondary School]], [[Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School (St. Catharines)|Sir Winston Churchill]], [[Governor Simcoe Secondary School|Governor Simcoe]], St. Catharines Collegiate, and [[Eden High School, St. Catharines, Ontario|Eden]]. The opening of DSBN Academy was described as "Canada's most controversial pedagogical experiment in years" by the ''Globe and Mail'', as the school was specifically geared towards low-income students. This raised fears about segregation in public education and causing low-income students to feel singled out. Proponents argued that the additional academic supports offered to disadvantaged students would raise their chances of attending post-secondary education.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hammer |first1=Kate |title=Proposed school for low-income students ignites controversy |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/proposed-school-for-low-income-students-ignites-controversy/article568353/ |website=The Globe and Mail |date=25 February 2011 |access-date=14 August 2022}}</ref> Governor Simcoe and Winston Churchill offer [[French immersion in Canada|French immersion]] programs.<ref>{{cite web |title=French Immersion Schools |url=https://www.dsbn.org/programs-services/french-immersion/fi-schools |website=DSBN |access-date=15 August 2022}}</ref> Eden Secondary School, although it operates through the DSBN and receives public school funding, is also a Christian school.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rau |first1=Krishna |title=Mennonite high school fully funded: The game of political hot potato surrounding Eden |url=https://xtramagazine.com/power/mennonite-high-school-fully-funded-39246 |website=Xtra Magazine |date=21 February 2007 |access-date=15 August 2022}}</ref>

The [[Niagara Catholic District School Board]] (NCDSB) manages and operates 3 Catholic secondary schools within the city: [[Holy Cross Secondary School (St. Catharines)|Holy Cross]], [[Denis Morris Catholic High School]], and [[St. Francis Catholic Secondary|Saint Francis]].

[[Ridley College (Ontario)|Ridley College]], near the city's downtown core in the Western Hill neighbourhood, is a private co-educational boarding and day school. It was established as a boys' school in 1889, and became co-educational in 1973.

=== Post-secondary ===
St. Catharines is home to [[Brock University]] (established 1964), a modern comprehensive university on the Niagara Escarpment. [[Concordia Lutheran Theological Seminary]], a post graduate institution of the [[Lutheran Church–Canada]], also operates there. A partnership between the university and the Ontario Grape and Wine Industry established the city as a centre for cool-climate grape and wine research.

The [[Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine]] is a medical school operated by [[McMaster University]] with a campus in downtown St. Catharines. Prior to 2004, it was known as the McMaster University School of Medicine.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the School of Medicine|url=http://fhs.mcmaster.ca/main/medschool_history.html|website=Faculty of Health Sciences|publisher=McMaster University|accessdate=October 18, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007182030/http://fhs.mcmaster.ca/main/medschool_history.html|archivedate=October 7, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Although not a part of St. Catharines itself, there are nearby campuses for [[Niagara College]] in [[Niagara on the Lake]] and [[Welland]]. The college used to operate a horticulture-related campus in the city on 360 Niagara Street, across from [[Laura Secord Secondary School]] from the 1970s to 1990s.

===Television===
The Niagara region has no television service of its own. Stations broadcasting from Toronto, [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] are available over-the-air in the region, and the region has a local transmitter (CKVP-DT) rebroadcasting the [[Barrie]] [[CTV 2]] station [[CKVR-DT]]. A local specialty news and information channel called [[Niagara News TV]] launched in February 2011, but ceased operations only 3 months later in April. In 2003, a local business consortium applied to the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) for a licence to operate TV Niagara, a [[Community channel (Canada)|community]] television station in St. Catharines. The application was denied by the CRTC in 2005, citing concerns about the group's business plan and its dependence on gaining audience share in the Toronto market.<ref>{{cite web |title=Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2005-544 |url=https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2005/db2005-544.htm |website=[[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] |date=18 November 2005 |publisher=[[Government of Canada]] |access-date=23 June 2022}}</ref>
