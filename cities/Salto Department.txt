The first division of the Republic in six departments happened on 27 January 1816. Two more departments were formed later in that year. At the time, Paysandú Department included all the territory north of the [[Río Negro (Uruguay)|Río Negro]], which included the actual departments of Artigas, Rivera, Tacuarembó, Salto, Paysandú and Río Negro. On 17 June 1837 a new division of Uruguay was made and the department of Salto was created including the actual [[Artigas Department]]. Its final borders were defined on 1 October 1884, when the Artigas Department was separated from Salto by the Act of Ley Nº 1854.
