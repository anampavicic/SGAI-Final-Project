'''Changwon''' ({{Korean|hangul=창원}}; {{IPA|ko|tɕʰaŋ.wʌn}}) is the capital and largest city of [[South Gyeongsang Province]], South Korea (with a population of 1,025,702 {{As of|2023|lc=y}}), and the 11th largest city of the [[South Korea|country]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kosis.kr/eng/|title=Population Census|date=2015–2021|website=Korean Statistical Information Service}}</ref>

A port city, Changwon is bordered by Masan Bay to the south, and the cities of [[Busan]] and [[Gimhae]] to the east. The city of [[Miryang]] lies to the northeast, and [[Jinju]] to the west.

The region has been inhabited since the Bronze Age, and its urban areas have been renamed and re-organized many times throughout history. In 1974, with the creation of the Changwon National Industrial Complex, the three historically interdependent cities of [[Masan]], [[Jinhae District]], and Changwon began to undergo significant economic development, growing into an important industrial centre. On 1 July 2010, the cities of Changwon, Jinhae, and Masan merged to form the current city of Changwon.<ref name=":62">{{Cite web|url=http://eng.changwon.go.kr/new/jsp/sub01/01_03_02_n.jsp|title=History of Changwon|website=eng.changwon.go.kr|access-date=14 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141004161603/http://eng.changwon.go.kr/new/jsp/sub01/01_03_02_n.jsp|archive-date=4 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

As Korea's first [[Planned community|planned city]], modeled after [[Canberra]], Australia, Changwon uses accessible urban planning including many parks and separate residential and industrial areas.<ref name=":14">{{Cite book|title=Grounding Globalization: Labour in the Age of Insecurity|author1=Webster, Edward |author2=Lambert, Rob |author3=Beziudenhout, Andries |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4051-2914-5|pages=chapter 6}}</ref> The city has also branded itself an "environmental capital" with the municipal government actively participating in climate change conferences and committing to the development of sustainable policies like the globally recognized bike-sharing program, Nubija.<ref name=":22">{{Cite book|title=Global Cities and Climate Change: The Translocal Relations of Environmental Governance|last=Lee|first=Taedong|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=978-0415737371|pages=105}}</ref>

==History==
=== Early history ===
Populated since the early [[Bronze Age]], the area surrounding Masan Bay would have been a wide open region between the ocean and the hilly lands of the coastal plain. Today ruins can be found in the area dating from the [[Iron Age]]. Typical Iron Age landmarks include Bangyedong monuments, dolmens, holy mounds, lower molar sites, and dolmens from Bronze Age settlements.

In 209 AD, during the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] period, the area was named Gulja-gun, a province of the [[Silla]] kingdom. During the Unified [[Silla]] Period, this region was renamed to Uian-gun in 739 AD, during the reorganization of all Silla provinces, then in the [[Goryeo]] Period, to Uichang-hyeon.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The name Changwon was first used in 1408 during the [[Joseon]] period, when King Taejong established the city as Changwon-bu. In 1415, he renamed Changwon-bu to Changwon-dohobu. Later during the King Sunjo Period (1601), it became Changwondae-do hobu.<ref name=":62"/>

In 1895, the country was reorganized into 23 divisions by King Gojong, and Changwondae-do hobu was split into Changwon-gun and Ungcheon-gun. In 1908 Ungcheon-gun merged with nearby Jinhae-gun. During the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial period]], the city became known as Masan-bu, and Masan Port was opened. Eventually, Changwon was separated from Masan-bu.<ref name=":62"/>

=== Post-Korean War ===
In 1970, the Masan Free Export Zone was opened to encourage foreign business to move to the area. In 1974, Changwon was selected to be an industrial and residential centre, as well as the provincial capital. The Changwon Industrial Complex was built in the south of the city, while Changwon began urban planning modelling itself after Canberra, Australia.<ref name=":14"/>

The country's longest straight road was constructed in Changwon, with a length of {{convert|15.27|km|mi}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20100405026008|title=City and Street Changwon blov|date=5 April 2010 |publisher=Seoul News|access-date=5 April 2010}}</ref> with the industrial park to the south and residential complexes constructed to the north. This road, Changwon Daero, is meant to serve as an airplane runway in a state of emergency as Changwon was designed to be South Korea's emergency backup capital city. Underground walkways are able to serve as bomb shelters and roads and buildings in the planned city are numbered for efficient use in evacuation.<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=http://changwonliving.blogspot.ca/2012/07/yongi-lake-and-korean-war-memorial.html|title=YONGJI LAKE AND KOREAN WAR MEMORIAL|website=changwonliving.blogspot.ca|access-date=17 March 2017|date=29 July 2012}}</ref>

In 1985, the Korean War Monument ({{Korean|충혼탑|labels=no}}) in Changwon's Uichang gu was constructed. The {{convert|47.1|m|ft}} monument is "dedicated to the 1,142 soldiers from Gyeongsangnam province that died in the Korean War."<ref name=":7"/>

On 1 July 2010, the three neighboring cities of [[Masan]], Changwon and [[Jinhae]] unified to create ''Unified Changwon City'', with a population of 1.04&nbsp;million.<ref name=":62"/>

==Geography==
[[File:Changwon_Downtown_foggy.jpeg|thumb|300px|Downtown Changwon]]
Changwon is located on the southeastern coast of the Korean Peninsula, on the Nakdong River delta<ref name=":22"/> looking out onto Masan Bay. The city is surrounded by mountains, the highest of which are Mt. Bulmo ({{convert|802|m|ft|abbr=on}}), Mt. Jeongbyeong ({{convert|567|m|ft|abbr=on}}), and Mt. Jangbok ({{convert|582|m|ft|abbr=on}}).<ref name=":14"/>

The city also comprises several small islands in Masan Bay and along the coast including Dot island, Sokuri island, and several uninhabited islands.

The city has four distinct seasons. The climate of Changwon is a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cwa'') with very warm summers and cold winters. The average temperature ranged between {{convert|2.8|C|F}} in January to {{convert|26.5|C|F}} in August. The average annual precipitation is {{convert|1527|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Between 1980 and 1990 there was an annual average of around 116 sunny days a year (32% of the year), and between 1990 and 2000 an average of 135 (37%).

=== Neighborhoods ===
The development of Changwon into an industrial city during the 1960s and 1970s has led to a city structure that is bisected by one main avenue called Changwon Daero, meaning Changwon big road. To the south are the factories, to the north are all of the residential areas. Changwon Daero also serves as emergency runway for military purposes.

The Financial district is located in the southern part of Jungang-dong and Sangnam-dong, while the government district located northern part of Youngho-dong and Shinwol-dong.

The Changdong Art Village has many murals and artwork on display throughout the streets. Originally Masan's old town, when businesses began to disperse, "ateliers, cafés, and galleries took over the vacant stores<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/ATR/SI_EN_3_6.jsp?cid=2033188|title=Changwon, a city loved by artists|website=[[VisitKorea.or.kr]]|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16|archive-date=22 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322111441/http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/ATR/SI_EN_3_6.jsp?cid=2033188|url-status=dead}}</ref>" transforming the area into a thriving art district.

The Sangnam neighborhood is the central part of greater Changwon. The main part of this neighborhood, the Sangnam Commercial District ({{Korean|hangul=상남상업지구|labels=no}}), is the main nightlife area, with many bars, hotels, business bars, [[Karaoke|noraebangs]], and restaurants. On every day of the month with a date that ends in 4 or 9 the market "Sangnam-sijang" is open and bustling for business. This is the largest farmer's market within the city, with vendors selling fresh seafood, vegetables, and other groceries as well as clothing and pottery. There is also a large-scale residential complex of high-rise apartments.

Jungan-dong, located just west of Sangnam, is the "old town" and extended central area of the city. There is more nightlife here than restaurants, and local English speaking expats often frequent the area for drinks and laughs, often living very nearby. This is the most likely place to meet one of the foreign English teachers, engineers and armed services residence of the area.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}
