'''Akola'''  ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|oː|l|aː}}) is a major city in the [[Vidarbha]] region of the [[India]]n state of [[Maharashtra]]. The [[List of cities in Vidarbha|third largest city in Eastern Maharashtra]] after [[Nagpur]] and [[Amravati]], it is located about {{Convert|580|km|mi|abbr=}} east of the state capital, [[Mumbai]], and {{Convert|250|km|mi|abbr=}} west of the second capital, [[Nagpur]]. Akola is the administrative headquarters of the [[Akola district]] located in the [[Amravati division]].

This term is thought to refer to the city's historical role as a boundary or administrative center in the region. According to local tradition, the city was named after Maharaja Akolsingh, who was an influential figure in the area.

==History==
=== Early medieval history (Classical) ===
Akola is mentioned to be a part of [[Berar Province|Berar province]] and the legendary kingdom of [[Vidarbha Kingdom|Vidarbha]] in the [[Sanskrit]] epic [[Mahabharata]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mahanbharat.net/geography/mahabharat-map|title=Mahabharat Map - Come, let us create a Mahan Bharat.|website=www.mahanbharat.net|accessdate=30 April 2023}}</ref>

=== Late medieval history ===
A period of [[Muslim rule of India|Muslim rule]] began when [[Alauddin Khalji]], [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultan of Delhi]], conquered the region in the early 14th century. The region was part of the [[Bahmani Sultanate]], which broke away from the Delhi Sultanate in the middle of the 14th century. The Bahmani Sultanate itself broke up into smaller sultanates at the end of the 15th century, and in 1572 Berar became part of the [[Nizam Shahi]] sultanate, based at [[Ahmadnagar|Ahmednagar]]. The Nizam Shahis ceded Berar to the [[Mughal Empire]] in 1595, and the Mughals ruled the Berar province during the 17th century. The Akola fort was heavily fortified during Mughal king [[Aurangzeb]]'s rule.<ref name="fof2">{{cite web|title=Friends of Forts|url=http://www.fortsofsahyadri.friendsofforts.com/list_of_maharashtraforts.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405125744/http://www.fortsofsahyadri.friendsofforts.com/list_of_maharashtraforts.htm|archive-date=5 April 2009|access-date=2009-02-04}}</ref> As Mughal rule started to unravel at the start of the 18th century, [[Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asif Jah I|Asif Jah I]], [[Nizam]] of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] seized the southern provinces of the empire (including Berar) in 1724 to form an independent state.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Berar {{!}} region, India|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Berar|access-date=2020-08-06|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>

=== Maratha Empire ===
The [[Battle of Argaon]] in 1803 was fought in Akola between the [[British East India|British]] and the Marathas during the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]]. In the [[third Anglo-Maratha War]], the last Peshwa, [[Baji Rao II]], was defeated. In 1853, the Akola district together with the rest of Berar, came under the administration of the [[British East India Company]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Akola District Gazetteer, Mediaeval Period History |url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/AKOLA/his_mediaeval%20period.html |website=Maharashtra State Gazetteers, Akola District |access-date=24 July 2020}}</ref>

=== Post-independence ===
After [[Indian independence movement|India's independence]] in 1947 from the British Government, the newly formed country was divided into different states. The [[Indian National Congress|Congress]]'s proposed linguistic provinces plan before the Independence of India had positioned Akola as the headquarters of the Berar region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/101.html|title=101|access-date=19 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/tables/101a.html|title=101a|access-date=19 September 2014}}</ref>

[[Akola Airport]] (also known as Shioni Airport) {{Airport codes|AKD|VAAK}} is the domestic airport serving Akola. Situated {{Convert|999|ft|m|abbr=|order=flip}} above sea level, the airport was established by British authorities in the 1940s. It initially provided regular flights to Mumbai. However, the airport is currently non-functional, with its single runway measuring 4,600×145 feet.

The expansion and potential resumption of airport operations have been impeded by difficulties in acquiring land from the Dr. Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth university. As of now, the airport's infrastructure remains underutilized, and there are ongoing discussions regarding its future development.<ref>{{cite news |title=AAI red flags Akola airport extension |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/AAI-redflags-Akola-airport-extension/articleshow/35353330.cms |work=The Times of India |date=20 May 2014 |access-date=23 August 2024}}</ref>
