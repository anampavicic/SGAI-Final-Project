Ormoc City is a port city and is the largest city in Leyte by land area and the second-largest in Eastern Visayas after [[Calbayog]] in Samar. At the head of [[Ormoc Bay]], the city's terrain is mostly of gently rolling plains. It is bounded on the northwest by the towns of [[Matag-ob, Leyte|Matag-ob]] and [[Merida, Leyte|Merida]], in the north by [[Kananga, Leyte|Kananga]] and [[Carigara, Leyte|Carigara]], in the northeast by the towns of [[Jaro, Leyte|Jaro]], [[Pastrana, Leyte|Pastrana]] and [[Dagami, Leyte|Dagami]], and in the south by the town of [[Albuera, Leyte|Albuera]]. High mountain ranges separate Ormoc from the eastern portion of Leyte. Numerous rivers and streams traverse Ormoc. Among them are the Bao River in the north, Pagsangahan River in the west, the Bagong-bong River in the south, the Panilahan River also in the south and the Anilao and Malbasag Rivers which border the eastern and western flanks of Ormoc City Proper.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vigattintourism.com/tourism/articles/Ormoc-City-Leyte|title=Ormoc City, Leyte|first=Jhaypee|last=Guia|date=July 13, 2012|website=vigattintourism.com|access-date=December 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181203202710/https://www.vigattintourism.com/tourism/articles/Ormoc-City-Leyte|archive-date=December 3, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The natives of this city are [[demonym|called]] Ormocanons, with most being [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] speakers, as with the whole western and southern parts of the island of Leyte. A definite number of [[Waray language|Waray]] speakers is also present within the city.

Like most Filipinos, Ormocanons are predominantly [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Roman Catholic]], and the city celebrates its [[Feast of Sts. Peter and Paul|annual fiesta]] in honour of the patron saints [[Saint Peter]] and [[Saint Paul]] on June 28 and 29. Other main Catholic holy days, including the local fiestas of barangays, are observed throughout the year. There is also a visible [[Islam in the Philippines|Muslim]] minority within the city and all over the island, evidenced by the mosques within the cityscape and most of them are [[Maranao]]s from the twin provinces of [[Lanao del Norte]] and [[Lanao del Sur]] in Mindanao. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Economy==

{{PH poverty incidence}}

Ormoc's economic base is a mix of agriculture, aquaculture, industry, tourism, and commercial services. Sugar cane, rice and pineapple are the major agricultural production.

The city enjoys economic growth because it supplies a large part of the country's power needs with its abundant [[geothermal power|geothermal power resources]] from the Tongonan Geothermal Power Plant in Barangay Tongonan and the neighbouring [[Kananga, Leyte|Kananga]] town. Ormoc is also the gateway to the Leyte Industrial Development Estate in the nearby town of [[Isabel, Leyte|Isabel]], home of the Philippine Phosphate Fertilizer Plant, the largest fertilizer factory in Asia, and the Philippine Associated Smelter and Refining Company, the country's biggest copper processing plant, among other industries. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}} {{clear left}}
