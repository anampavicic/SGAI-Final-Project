===Climate===

The climate of Jammu and Kashmir varies with altitude and across regions. Southern and southwestern areas have a sub tropical climate, with hot summers and cool winters. This region receives most of its rainfall during the [[monsoon]] season. In the east and north, summers are usually pleasant. The effect of the monsoon diminishes in areas lying to the [[leeward side]] of the [[Pir Panjal]], such as the Kashmir valley, and much of the rainfall happens in the spring season due to [[western disturbances]]. Winters are cold, with temperatures reaching sub-zero levels. [[Snowfall]] is common in the valley and the mountain areas.
