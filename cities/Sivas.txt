'''Sivas''' is a city in central Turkey. It is the seat of [[Sivas Province]] and [[Sivas District]].<ref name=il>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx İl Belediyesi], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory. Retrieved 22 May 2023.</ref> Its population is 365,274 (2022).<ref name=tuik>{{Cite web |title=Address-based population registration system (ADNKS) results dated 31 December 2022, Favorite Reports|url=https://biruni.tuik.gov.tr/medas/?kn=95&locale=en |access-date=22 May 2023|publisher=[[TÜİK]]|language=en|format=XLS}}</ref>

The city, which lies at an elevation of {{convert|1278|m|ft}} in the broad valley of the [[Kızılırmak River|Kızılırmak]] river, is a moderately-sized trade centre and industrial city, although the economy has traditionally been based on [[agriculture]]. Rail repair shops and a thriving manufacturing industry of rugs, bricks, cement, and cotton and woolen [[Textile|textiles]] form the mainstays of the city's economy. The surrounding region is a cereal-producing area with large deposits of iron ore which are worked at [[Divriği]].

Sivas is also a [[Communications system|communications hub]] for the north–south and east–west trade routes to Iraq and Iran, respectively. With the development of railways, the city gained new economic importance as junction of important rail lines linking the cities of [[Ankara]], [[Kayseri]], [[Samsun]], and [[Erzurum]]. The city is linked by [[Sivas Airport|air]] to [[Istanbul]] and [[İzmir]]. The popular name [[Sebastian (name)|Sebastian]] derives from ''Sebastianòs'', Σεβαστιανός, meaning someone from the city.<ref name="Cresswell2007">{{cite book|author=Julia Cresswell|title=Naming Your Baby: The Definitive Dictionary of First Names|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M4vsr7FQ-q8C|date=5 November 2007|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-0-7136-8313-4|page=209}}</ref><ref name="Davis1995">{{cite book|last=Davis|first=J.

==History==

===Ancient and medieval===
[[File:Sivas_Museum_05.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Hittites|Hittite]] Artifacts in Sivas Archeology Museum]]
Little is known of Sivas' history prior to its emergence in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] period. In 64 BC, as part of his reorganization of [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] after the [[Third Mithridatic War]], [[Pompey|Pompey the Great]] founded a city on the site called "Megalopolis".<ref>[[Arnold Hugh Martin Jones|A.H.M. Jones]], ''The Cities of the Eastern Roman Provinces'', 2nd ed. (Oxford University Press, 1971), 159.</ref> Numismatic evidence suggests that Megalopolis changed its name in the last years of the 1st century BC to "Sebaste", the feminine form of [[Sebastos]], the [[Greek language|Greek]] equivalent of [[Augustus]]. The name "Sivas" is the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] version deriving from the name Sebasteia, as the city was known during the late [[Byzantine Empire|Roman (Byzantine) empire]]. Sebasteia became the capital of the province of [[Armenia Minor]] under the emperor [[Diocletian]], was a town of some importance in the early history of the Christian Church; in the 4th&nbsp;century it was the home of [[Saint Blaise]] and [[Peter of Sebaste|Saint Peter of Sebaste]], bishops of the town, and of [[Eustathius of Sebaste|Eustathius]], one of the early founders of [[monasticism]] in Asia Minor. It was also the place of martyrdom of the [[Forty Martyrs of Sebaste]], also 4th&nbsp;century. [[Justinian I]] had a fortified wall around it rebuilt in the 6th century. In the early 1020s, [[Basil II]] delivered the region around Sebasteia in exchange for [[Vaspurakan]] to King [[Seneqerim Ardzruni]], who settled in Sebasteia with thousands of his Armenian followers.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Krikorian|first=Mesrob K.|title=Armenians in the Service of the Ottoman Empire, 1860-1908|date=1977-01-01|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul|isbn=9781138492073|pages=53|language=en}}</ref>

Sebasteia was the first important city to be plundered by Turkish tribes in 1059.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosser|first=John H.|title=Historical dictionary of Byzantium|year=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=9780810875678|page=425|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYpqikYr3Q8C&dq=sebasteia+1059+turks&pg=PA425|edition=2nd}}</ref> In August of that year the troops of various emirs gathered before the unwalled city. Initially they hesitated to sack it, mistaking the domes of the city's several Christian churches for tents of military camps. As soon as they realized that the city was defenceless they burned it for eight days, slaughtered a large part of its population and took many prisoners.<ref name=Vryonis>[[Speros Vryonis]], [https://www.scribd.com/doc/39065646/Vryonis-Decline-of-Medieval-Hellinism-in-Asia-Minor ''The Decline of Medieval Hellenism in Asia Minor and the Process of Islamization from the Eleventh through the Fifteenth Century''] (University of California Press, 1971), p. 155</ref> The city came under the domain of [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] [[Danishmend]] dynasty (1071–1174) after the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071. After the death of Danişmend Gazi, Sivas passed to Nizamettin [[Yağıbasan]] who won it after a struggle with Danişmend Gazi's successors. In 1174, the city was captured by [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm|Seljuk]] ruler [[Kilij Arslan II]] and periodically served as capital of the Seljuk empire along with [[Konya]]. Under Seljuk rule, Sivas was an important center of trade along the [[Silk Road]] and site of a citadel, along with mosques and [[Madrasa|madrasas]] (Islamic educational institutions), four of which survive today and one of which houses the Sivas Museum. Then it passed to the [[Ilkhanids]], [[Eretna]] and [[Kadi Burhan al-Din|Kadı Burhanettin]].

=== Ottoman period ===
[[File:Sivas_Şifaiye_Medrese_8259.jpg|thumb|right|Tomb of [[Kaykaus I|Izz al-Din Kayka'us I]] in the [[Şifaiye Medrese]] (1217–1218)<ref name=":2411">{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780195309911|editor-last=M.

The city was acquired by Ottoman Sultan [[Bayezid I]] (1389–1402). In 1398, [[Tamerlane]] swept into the area and his forces destroyed the city in 1400, after which it was recaptured by the Ottomans in 1408.<ref name="Howorth">Henry Hoyle Howorth: ''History of the Mongols from the 9th to the 19th Century'', 2008, p. 166</ref>  Under the Ottomans, Sivas served as the administrative center of the [[Rûm Eyalet|Eyalet of Rum]]<ref name=":0" /> until about the late 19th century. The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] maintained six Armenian churches in Sivas, being the Meryemana, Surp Sarkis, Surp Minas, Surp Prgitsh, Surp Hagop, and Surp Kevork; four monasteries, [[Surb Nshan Monastery|Surp Nschan]], Surp Hreshdagabed, Surp Anabad, and Surp Hntragadar; an Armenian Apostolic orphanage, and several schools. The [[Armenian Catholic Church]] and the [[Latin Church|Latins]] also had one church and a metropolitan of Sebastea, as did the [[Greek Orthodox Church]].<ref>Pars Tuğlacı: Tarih boyunca Batı Ermenileri tarihi.

During the [[Armenian genocide|genocide against Armenians]] as well as during the [[Greek genocide|genocide against Greek Christians]] from July 5, 1915 onward, the Christian community of Sivas was exterminated during deportations and mass executions.<ref>Raymond Kévorkian: Le Génocide des Arméniens; Odile Jacob, Paris 2006, p. 542</ref>

=== Turkish Republic period ===
The [[Sivas Congress]] (''[[Committee of Representation|Heyet-i Temsiliye]]'') was held in this city 4–11 September 1919.<ref name="Halil87">Halil Gülbeyaz: ''Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Vom Staatsgründer zum Mythos'', Parthas, Berlin 2003, p. 87</ref> With the arrival of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] (1881–1938), the founder of the Turkish Republic, from [[Amasya]], the [[Congress of Sivas]] is considered a turning point in the formation of the Turkish Republic. It was at this congress that Atatürk's position as chair of the executive committee of the national resistance was confirmed (''see [[Turkish War of Independence]]''). Sivas was depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Turkish 500 [[Turkish lira|lira]] banknote of 1927–1939.<ref name="tcmb.gov.tr">[http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615060512/http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ |date=2009-06-15 }}.

On 2 July 1993, 37 participants in an [[Alevi]] cultural and literary festival were killed when a mob of demonstrators set fire to the Madımak hotel in Sivas during a violent protest by some 15,000 members of various radical [[Islamist]] groups against the presence of [[Aziz Nesin]]. The deaths resulted in the Turkish government taking a harder stance against religious fanaticism, militant Islam, and antisecularism. In late 2006, there was a campaign by the [[Pir Sultan Abdal]] Cultural Institute to convert the former hotel into a museum to commemorate the tragedy, now known as the [[Sivas massacre]].

Historically, Sivas was known for producing [[cereal]].

[[File:Gök Medrese.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gök Medrese, Sivas|Gök Medrese]] built by the [[Seljuk Empire]] in 1271]]
A cultural hub as well as an industrial one, Sivas contains many examples of 12th and 13th-century [[Anatolian Seljuk architecture|Seljuk architecture]]. The Great Mosque (''Ulu Cami'') of Sivas was first built in 1197.<ref name=":2411" /> The [[Sifaiye Medresesi]] was completed in 1217–1218 and served as a ''[[Bimaristan|darüşşifa]]'' (hospital and medical school). It has a [[four-iwan layout]] typical of Seljuk madrasas and is fronted by an elaborately-carved entrance portal. It also contains the tomb of its founder, the Seljuk sultan [[Kaykaus I|Izz al-Din Kayka'us I]] (d. 1220).<ref name=":2411" /> In 1271–1272, when the city was under Ilkhanid influence, three different madrasas were built by competing patrons: the [[Buruciye Medrese]], the ''[[Çifte Minareli Medrese (Sivas)|Çifte Minare Medresesi]]'', and the [[Gök Medrese, Sivas|Gök Medrese]] ("Blue Madrasa"; depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the Turkish 500 [[Turkish lira|lira]] banknote of 1927–1939<ref name="tcmb.gov.tr"/>).

The city also contains some fine examples of the Ottoman architectural style. The most prominent example of [[Ottoman architecture]] in the city is the Kale Camii ("Citadel Mosque"), built in 1580 by Mehmet Pasha, an Ottoman vizier.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sinclair|first=T.

Atatürk Congress and Ethnography Museum (''Atatürk Kongre ve Etnografya Müzesi'') is a museum with two sections. One is a dedicated to the Ottoman heritage of Sivas. The other is to the Sivas Congress, one of the pivotal moments in the Turkish national movement. Other museums include the [[Sivas Congress and Ethnography Museum]] and the [[Sivas Archaeology Museum]].
