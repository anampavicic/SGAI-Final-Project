It is home to a [[Diamond Exchange District]] (one of the world's major [[diamond]] exchanges), [[Sheba Medical Center]] (the largest hospital in Israel) and many high-tech industries.

==History==
[[File:GENERAL VIEW OF RAMAT GAN. העיר רמת גן.D25-073.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ramat Gan in 1936]]

Ramat Gan was established by the ''Ir Ganim''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/il-rg.html|title=Ramat Gan (Israel)|access-date=April 6, 2008}}</ref> association in 1921 as a [[satellite town]] of [[Tel Aviv]]. The first plots of land were purchased between 1914 and 1918.<ref name=JVL>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&_Culture/geo/ramatgan.html|title=Ramat Gan |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|access-date=April 6, 2008}}</ref> It stood just south of the [[Arab]] village of [[Jarisha]].{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} The settlement was initially a [[moshava]], a [[Zionist]] agricultural colony that grew [[wheat]], [[barley]] and [[Watermelon|watermelons]].<ref name=profile/> The name of the settlement was changed to Ramat Gan (lit: ''Garden Height'') in 1923. The settlement continued to operate as a moshava until 1933, although it achieved [[local council (Israel)|local council]] status in 1926. At this time it had 450 residents. In the 1940s, Ramat Gan became a battleground in the country's language war: A [[Yiddish]] language printing press in Ramat Gan was blown up by Hebrew-language extremists.<ref>Pilowsky, A: "Yiddish Alongside The Revival of Hebrew Public Polemics on the Status of Yiddish in Eretz Israel, 1907–1929", Readings in the Sociology of Jewish Languages, page 123.
