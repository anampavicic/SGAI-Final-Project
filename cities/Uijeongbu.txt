'''Uijeongbu''' ({{Korean|hangul=의정부}}; {{IPA|ko|ɰi.dʑʌŋ.bu}}) is a [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|city]] in [[Gyeonggi Province]], [[South Korea]].<ref name="Britannica">{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/612806/Uijongbu | title=Ŭijŏngbu | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica | access-date=16 January 2015}}</ref>

==History==
{{Expand section|date=June 2024}}

==Overview==
Uijeongbu is located north of the South Korean capital [[Seoul]]; it lies inside a [[Defile (geography)|defile]],  with mountains on two sides, and commands a natural [[choke point]] across the main traditional invasion route from the North into [[Seoul]]. As such it has a continued military significance and it contains U.S. and South Korean military bases, positioned for the defense of the South Korean capital. The [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. Second Infantry Division]] has established a headquarters post in Uijeongbu, with the main troops being deployed from [[Dongducheon]] city. U.S. military bases in Uijeongbu have since closed.

Despite being known for its military presence, the area has boomed into a satellite community of Seoul with shops, cinemas, restaurants and bars, [[PC bang|internet cafes]], and DVD bangs. In addition to U.S. personnel, it is popular with the English [[hagwon]] (a for-profit private institute, academy or [[cram school]]). There are several mountains such as Mt. Dobong ([[Dobongsan]]), Mt. Surak and Mt. Soyo. The mountains are popular recreational areas for hiking and are frequented by residents living in the Seoul Metropolitan area.

This city is also famous for its [[budae-jjigae]] (lit. "army base stew"), made with [[hot dog]]s and [[Spam (food)|SPAM]]. In the late 20th century, many wanted the dish to be referred as ''Uijeongbu jjigae'' to remove the military or war-time connotations it had associated with it. However, not many restaurants followed this guideline. Some restaurants have begun calling their product ''Uijeongbu budae jjigae.'' The city also contains what locals refer to as "buddaejjigae street", a street where there is a high concentration of army base stew restaurants.<ref>Kim, Violet [http://www.cnngo.com/seoul/eat/food-map-search-koreas-best-regional-cuisine-391772 "Food map: Eat your way around Korea"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408155616/http://www.cnngo.com/seoul/eat/food-map-search-koreas-best-regional-cuisine-391772 |date=2012-04-08 }} ''CNN Go''. 6 April 2012.

==Transport==
[[File:Uijeongbu metro map-fr.svg|left|thumb|VAL network map]]
A [[Véhicule Automatique Léger|VAL]] driverless metro system, [[U Line]], is an elevated line, {{convert|11.067|km|abbr=on}} long, covering 15 stations.<ref>http://www.transportation.siemens.com/en/data/pdf/ts_internet/ts_corp/presse/2006/29_korea_ujeongbu_e.pdf{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  It had its grand opening on 26 June 2012 with normal passenger operations on 1 July 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/uijeongbu-light-rail-transit/|title=Uijeongbu Light Rail Transit - Railway Technology|work=railway-technology.com|access-date=17 January 2015}}</ref>

Uijeongbu is also served by the [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway]]'s [[Seoul Subway Line 1|Line 1]] and [[Seoul Subway Line 7|Line 7]]. The six stations within the city boundaries are [[Nogyang Station|Nogyang]], [[Ganeung Station|Ganeung]], [[Uijeongbu Station|Uijeongbu]], [[Hoeryong Station|Hoeryong]], [[Mangwolsa Station|Mangwolsa]], and [[Jangam Station|Jangam]]. It takes around 40 minutes to reach Uijeongbu from central Seoul by subway.

Extensive bus routes cover north-eastern [[Gyeonggi Province|Gyeonggi-do]]. There are three basic kinds: ''Ilban Bus'', normal bus; ''Jwaseok Bus'', larger and slightly more expensive; and ''Maeul Bus'', "village bus", a smaller bus with fewer seats. An intercity bus station is available for longer distances. Airport ''limousine buses'' run frequently to both [[Incheon International Airport|Incheon]] and [[Gimpo International Airport|Gimpo]] airports.

==Education==
The South Korean educational system,<ref name="wes.org">{{cite web|url=http://wenr.wes.org/2013/06/wenr-june-2013-an-overview-of-education-in-south-korea|title=Education in South Korea|date=1 June 2013}}</ref> regarded as one of the most difficult in the world,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/04/15/393939759/the-all-work-no-play-culture-of-south-korean-education|title=The All-Work, No-Play Culture Of South Korean Education|website=[[NPR]]}}</ref> officially incorporates Primary or Elementary, Middle, Secondary, Vocational and Tertiary levels.<ref name="wes.org"/> Anything below primary school is not required. Uijeongbu is home to several educational establishments, most of which are available to both South Korean citizens and foreign nationals. Some schools, however, are only accessible to the families and other affiliates of the US Army.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apps.militaryonesource.mil/MOS/f?p=132:CONTENT:0::NO::P4_INST_ID,P4_INST_TYPE:2800,INSTALLATION|title=MilitaryINSTALLATIONS - U.S. Department of Defense|first=Military Community Outreach|last=MC&FP|website=apps.militaryonesource.mil}}</ref> The schools in Uijeongbu range from the standard Korean high school, such as Gyeonggi High School,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uigo.hs.kr/wah/main/index.htm#Contents |script-title=ko:의정부고등학교|website=www.uigo.hs.kr}}</ref> to the Americanized, [[International Christian School Uijongbu|International Christian School]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ics-ujb.org/about/contact/contact-us.php |title=Contact Us |access-date=2016-11-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109153143/http://www.ics-ujb.org/about/contact/contact-us.php |archive-date=2016-11-09 }}</ref> which lies in the northern part of the city, close to [[Nogyang Station]].
Earlier forms of education, such as kindergarten, are not compulsory in South Korea and young children traditionally remain with the family as long as possible,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asiasociety.org/education/value-and-meaning-korean-family|title=The Value and Meaning of the Korean Family}}</ref> but many are still available. One such establishment is the privately run kindergarten, Yebbeun Kindergarten<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapio.net/place/39570012/|script-title=ko:예쁜유치원 |trans-title=Yebbeun Kindergarten - Mapio.net|website=Mapio.net}}</ref> or Pretty Kindergarten ({{Korean|예쁜유치원|labels=no}}) which is located near [[Saemal Station]].
From the age of six, school children in Uijeongbu, like most of South Korea, begin attending elementary school. There are several elementary schools throughout Uijeongbu, such as Yonghyun primary school ({{Korean|용현초등학교|labels=no}}),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.banghakcho.es.kr/index/index.do |title=서울방학초등학교 홈 |access-date=2016-11-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109220807/http://www.banghakcho.es.kr/index/index.do |archive-date=2016-11-09 }}</ref> or {{lang|ko|방학초등학교}}, and Vocational Elementary school,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://school.cybo.com/KR/uijeongbu/primary-and-elementary-schools/|title=Primary and elementary schools Uijeongbu|website=Cybo}}</ref> so a wide variety is provided. 
The next stage of schooling begins around the age of thirteen and is a part of middle school education. Uijeongbu has a few middle schools, such as Solmoe Middle School ({{Korean|솔뫼중학교|labels=no}}),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.solmoe.ms.kr/wah/main/index.htm |script-title=ko:솔뫼중학교|website=www.solmoe.ms.kr}}</ref> located in the southeastern part of the city, right off [[National Route 43 (South Korea)|Route 43]]. The high school or secondary level of education is widely available in Uijeongbu as well. With high schools like the aforementioned Gyeonggi High School,<ref>[[Gyeonggi Science High School]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=December 2016}} or [[Uijeongbu High School]] which is known for its unusual graduation "dress up" ritual.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaboo.com/interactive/this-korean-high-school-has-a-shocking-tradition-thatll-make-you-lol-uncontrollably/|title=This Korean High School Has A Shocking Tradition That'll Make You LOL Uncontrollably|date=6 March 2015}}</ref> There is an apparent lack of vocational high schools or those that focus on specialized curricula, such as fishery or economics.
However, there are several higher education options at the tertiary level available in Uijeongbu. One such school is the Shinhan University,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.shc.ac.kr/ |title=Shinhan University |access-date=2016-11-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211172638/http://en.shc.ac.kr/ |archive-date=2016-12-11 }}</ref> which has an extensive array of choices for majors ranging from culinary to nursing. Uijeongbu is also the site of Kyungmin College,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kyungmin.ac.kr/index.html |script-title=ko:경민대학교|website=www.kyungmin.ac.kr}}</ref> which prepares teachers.
