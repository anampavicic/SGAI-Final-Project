==History==
One of the earliest references to Jijiga comes from W.C. Barker in 1842 who mentions it as one of the ''mahalla'' or halting-places of the caravan route between [[Zeila]] and [[Harar]] within the Somali inhabited [[Ogaden]] (present day [[Somali Region]]).<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1798000 "Extract Report on the Probable Geographical Position of Harrar; With Some Information Relative to the Various Tribes in the Vicinity"], ''[[Journal of the Royal Geographical Society]]'', '''12''' (1842), p.&nbsp;244</ref> Jijiga was later mentioned by British traveler [[Richard Francis Burton]] in 1854, who reports that it was a centre of wells for pastoralists of the local Somali ([[Jidwaq (clan)|Jidwaq]]) clan on the caravan route to [[Berbera]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Burton |first1=Richard |title=First Footsteps in East Africa |publisher=Tylston and Edwards |year=1894 |page=192 }}</ref> During the pre-colonial era the Ogaden was neither under Ethiopian rule, nor [[Terra nullius|''terra nullius'']], as it was occupied by organized Somali communities.{{Sfn|FitzGibbon|1985|pp=33–34}} Independent historical accounts are unanimous that previous to the penetration into the region in the late 1880s, [[Somali clans]] were free of residing in the Ogaden were free of the control of the [[Ethiopian Empire]].{{Sfn|FitzGibbon|1985|p=29}}

In 1887, the Ethiopian Empire under [[Menelik II]] invaded and conquered the ancient city of [[Harar]] and soon after announced a programme of ambitious expansion and colonialism to the European powers. This marked the start of a tentative yet violent invasion into the [[Ogaden]] region.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last1=Woodward |first1=Peter |url=http://archive.org/details/conflictpeaceinh00pete |title=Conflict and peace in the Horn of Africa : federalism and its alternatives |last2=Forsyth |first2=Murray |date=1994 |publisher=Aldershot |isbn=978-1-85521-486-6 |location=Dartmouth |pages=105–106}}</ref> During the Abyssinian invasion of Harar, much of the population and the cities Islamic scholars were massacred.

===British===
On 17 March 1941, during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] of [[World War II]], Jijiga was occupied by the [[1st (West Africa) Infantry Brigade|23rd Nigerian Brigade]] of the British [[1st (African) Division|1st African Division]]. This was after the Italian garrison had already abandoned the city.<ref>Mockler, pp.&nbsp;365f</ref> In 1948, the [[British Military Administration (Somaliland)|British Military Administration]], which had been in control of the Ogaden since WWII, commenced a withdrawal. This transition saw the replacement of British officials with Ethiopian counterparts between May and July of that year in a significant handover process.{{Sfn|Drysdale|1964|p=70-71}} In the town of [[Jijiga]], incoming Ethiopian authorities instructed the [[Somali Youth League]] (SYL) to remove their flag, as they had declared both the party and its emblem as unlawful. The SYL defied this directive, leading to the flag being machine-gunned by an armored vehicle. This event escalated following the killing of a police officer after a grenade was thrown of the roof of the SYL headquarters. The police responded by firing into a crowd of protesters killing 25. Following this incident, Ethiopian administration resumed in Jijiga for the first time in 13 years. Then, on 23 September 1948, following the withdrawal of British forces and the appointment of Ethiopian district commissioners, areas east of Jijiga were placed under Ethiopian governance for the first time in history.{{Sfn|Drysdale|1964|p=70-71}}

[[Germame Neway]], one of the leaders of the unsuccessful [[1960 Ethiopian coup|1960 coup]], served as governor over Jijiga in 1959.

==Climate==
The [[climate]] of Jijiga is a [[oceanic climate|subtropical highland climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Cwb''). extremely wet and lush during rainy season, as with the rest of the Ethiopian highlands, Seasonal differences relate only to rainfall, as temperatures year-round are cool to mild in the mornings and uniformly very warm though not hot during the afternoons.

There are two rainy seasons: the main ''meher'' rains occur from July to September, and the short ''belg'' rains in April and June. The dry season, known as ''bega'', is cooler by morning than the wet seasons due to lower cloud cover, but equally hot by afternoon though less humid.

==Ecology==
The vegetation is a grassland from the east and south of the city towards wajaale, with Pockets of juipars and gum forest in higher altitudes in the northern and western part of the city, there is extensive history of animal life in the past. For example, the area was earlier a habitat for the [[African wild dog]], ''Lycaon pictus'',<ref>C. Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=35993 ''Painted Hunting Dog: Lycaon pictus'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N.

In his memoirs of his homeland, [[Nega Mezlekia]] describes Jijiga as sitting "on the edge of a vast, unmitigated valley on the bottom of Mount Kramanda the beginning of the mighty Ethiopian highlands, with vast lush greenery in sight, rolling hills and plains dotted with many farms in all directions the soaring Eastern Ethiopian Highlands slowly climbing west, the very common tall grassland tree used as shelter by the wandering [[hyena]], and the inevitable sacred tree in every compound, trees in this area of the Somali region reach great heights with the help of generous rainfall year-round, the native Somalis in the area would use this area as a dry season grazing land for all the noble tribes of the land. The city is surrounded by rocky tall green mountains on all sides save the north all the way past nearby Harar all the way to Addis, which is open as far as the eye can see."<ref>Nega Mezlekia<!-- proper attribution is "Nega Mezlekia" not "Mezlekia, Nega " -->, ''Notes from the Hyena's Belly: An Ethiopian Childhood'' (New York: Picador,2000), p. 5. {{ISBN|0-312-28914-6}}</ref>
