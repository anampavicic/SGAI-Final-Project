'''Tamaulipas''' ({{IPA|es|tamawˈlipas|-|TamaulipasPronunciation.ogg}}), officially the '''Free and Sovereign State of Tamaulipas''' ({{langx|es|Estado Libre y Soberano de Tamaulipas}}), is a state in [[Mexico]]; one of the 31 states which, along with [[Mexico City]], comprise the 32 [[Political divisions of Mexico|Federal Entities]] of [[Mexico]]. It is divided into [[Municipalities of Tamaulipas|43 municipalities]].

It is located in northeast Mexico and is bordered by the states of  [[Nuevo León]] to the west, [[San Luis Potosí]] to the southwest, and [[Veracruz]] to the southeast. To the north, it has a {{convert|370|km|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}} stretch of the [[U.S.–Mexico border]] with the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Texas]], and to the east it is bordered by the [[Gulf of Mexico]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Tamaulipas |url=http://www.sre.gob.mx/coordinacionpolitica/images/stories/documentos_gobiernos/fttam.pdf |publisher=SRE |access-date=April 7, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110421015920/http://www.sre.gob.mx/coordinacionpolitica/images/stories/documentos_gobiernos/fttam.pdf |archive-date=April 21, 2011 }}</ref> In addition to the capital city, [[Ciudad Victoria]], the state's largest cities include [[Reynosa, Tamaulipas|Reynosa]], [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]], [[Nuevo Laredo]], [[Tampico, Tamaulipas|Tampico]], and [[Ciudad Mante|Mante]].

==Etymology==
The name Tamaulipas is derived from ''Tamaholipa'', a [[Huastec language|Huastec]] term in which the ''tam-'' prefix signifies "place (where)". No scholarly agreement exists on the meaning of ''holipa'', but "high hills" is a common interpretation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historia|url=http://tamaulipas.gob.mx/tamaulipas/historia/|publisher=Gobierno del Estado de Tamaulipas|access-date=April 7, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223112732/http://tamaulipas.gob.mx/tamaulipas/historia/|archive-date=December 23, 2010}}</ref> Another explanation of the state name is that it is derived from ''Ta ma ho'lipam'' ("place where the [[Lipan Apache people|Lipan Apache]] prey").

== History ==
The area known as Tamaulipas has been inhabited for at least 8,000 years. Several different cultures (north coastal, south coastal, lowlands, and mountains) have come and gone during that period.

Tamaulipas was originally populated by the nomad [[Chichimeca|Chichimec]] and sedentary [[Huastec people|Huastec]], in addition to non-Chichimec hunter-gatherer and fishing tribes.

===Spanish era===
A gradual process was needed for Spain to subjugate the inhabitants of Tamaulipas in the 16th and 17th centuries. The first permanent [[Spain|Spanish]] settlement in the area was [[Tampico, Tamaulipas|Tampico]] in 1554. Further settlement was done by [[Franciscan]] missionaries; widespread cattle and sheep ranching by the Spanish bolstered the area's economy while forcing native populations from their original lands. Repeated indigenous rebellions kept the area unstable and weakened colonial interest in the region. What is now Tamaulipas was first incorporated as a separate province of [[New Spain]] in 1746 with the name [[Nuevo Santander]]. The local government capital during this time moved from Santander to San Carlos, and finally to Aguayo. The territory of this time spanned from the San Antonio River to the northeast to the Gulf of Mexico, then south to the [[Pánuco River]] near Tampico and west to the Sierra Madre Mountains. The area became a haven for rebellious Indians who fled there after increased Spanish settlements in Nuevo León and Coahuila.

In 1784 Nuevo Santander (Tamaulipas) led by Escandón, annexed San Antonio de los Llanos and its dependencies on the Purificación lagoon together with a certain number of ranches on the right bank of the Río Grande that belonged to Nuevo León. New settlements were then founded and the line of towns along the Rio Grande would later be dubbed the "villas del norte," or northern towns (Laredo, Revilla [Guerrero], Mier, Camargo, and Reynosa) which were established as a key part of Escandón's plan for the pacification and colonization of the province. These settlements, from Laredo to Reynosa, served as a defensive line for larger centers of population in the Mexican interior. Moreover, the villas functioned as a means to introduce Spanish "civilization" to the indigenous groups of the area. The Tamaulipas-Nuevo Leon border likely runs along old Mesquite Posts.<ref>{{cite book|title=Cartografía histórica de Tamaulipas| isbn=9789686361162 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dOASAQAAIAAJ&q=Cartograf%C3%ADa+hist%C3%B3rica+de+Tamaulipas|access-date=July 7, 2022| last1=Vayssade | first1=Martín Reyes | last2=Cultura | first2=Instituto Tamaulipeco de | year=1990 | publisher=Instituto Tamaulipeco de Cultura }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Guadalajara y Sevilla: dos ciudades hermanadas en el reino de Nueva Galicia| year=2004 | publisher=Fundación El Monte | isbn=9788484551058 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mFMlAQAAIAAJ&q=Guadalajara+y+Sevilla:+dos+ciudades+hermanadas+en+el+reino+de+Nueva+Galicia|access-date=July 7, 2022}}</ref>

In the mid-17th century, various [[Apache]] bands from the Southern Plains, after acquiring horses from Europeans in New Mexico, moved southeastward into the [[Edwards Plateau]], displacing the native hunting and gathering groups. One of these groups was known as [[Lipan Apache people|Lipan]] (see Hodge 1907 Vol. I:769 for a confusing list of synonyms). After 1750, when most Apache groups of the Central Texas highlands were displaced by [[Comanche]] and moved into the coastal plain of southern Texas, the Europeans of the San Antonio area began referring to all Apache groups in southern Texas as Lipan or Lipan Apache.<ref>(Campbell and Campbell 1981:62–64).</ref>

Many Indian groups of missions in southern Texas and northeastern Mexico had recently been displaced from their territory through the southward push by the Lipan Apaches and were still hostile toward Apaches, linking arms with the local Spanish authorities against their common foe.

By 1790, Europeans turned their attention from the aboriginal groups and focused on containing the Apache invaders. In northeastern Coahuila and adjacent Texas, Spanish and Apache displacements created an unusual ethnic mix. Here, the local Indians mixed with displaced groups from Coahuila and Chihuahua and Texas. Some groups, to escape the pressure, combined and migrated north into the Central Texas highlands.

=== Independent Mexico ===
In 1824, after the [[Mexican War of Independence]] from Spain, and the fall of the [[First Mexican Empire|Mexican Empire]], Tamaulipas was one of the 19 founder states of the new [[United Mexican States]]. Slavery was formally abolished by the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|1824 Constitution]]. During the fights between centralists and federalists that after independence, the successful [[Texas Revolution]] led to the creation of the [[Republic of Texas]] in 1836. The new republic claimed as part of its territory northern Tamaulipas.

[[File:Political divisions of Mexico 1824 (location map scheme).svg|left|thumb|190px|Tamaulipas in Mexico, 1824]]
In 1840, it became a part of the short-lived [[Republic of the Rio Grande]]. In 1848, after the [[Mexican–American War]], Tamaulipas lost more than a quarter of its territory via the [[Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo]]. American president [[James K. Polk]] had desired to annex Mexican territory as far south as [[Tampico]] although his negotiator [[Nicholas Trist]] disregarded this and settled on a border with Texas on the Rio Grande.<ref>Howe, Daniel Walker. ''What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815-1848''. Oxford University Press, 2007. p.801-804</ref> Its capital was kept at Aguayo, which later was renamed [[Ciudad Victoria]] in honor of [[Guadalupe Victoria]], first [[President of Mexico]].

In the wake of the war, Tamaulipas remained an object of interest to [[Manifest destiny|American expansionists]]. The climate was considered suitable for the spread of [[slavery]] by [[Southern United States|Southerners]] who desired the admission of new territory to shift the balance in [[United States Congress|Congress]] back towards the [[slave state]]s. Senator [[Albert Gallatin Brown]] declared "I want Tamaulipas, [[San Luis Potosí|Potosi]], and one or two other Mexican states; and I want them all for the same reason - for the plantation and spreading of slavery".<ref>McPherson, James M. ''Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era''. Oxford University Press, 2003. p.105</ref> In the 1850s [[José María Jesús Carbajal]] led several incursions into Tamaulipas<ref>Hart, John Mason. ''Empire and Revolution: The Americans in Mexico since the Civil War''. University of California Press, 2002. p.24</ref> before being indicted for violating the [[Neutrality Act of 1794|Neutrality Act]]. [[Filibuster (military)|Filibustering]] efforts were also directed towards [[Cuba]] with the [[Lopez Expedition]], which was desired for the same reason as Tamaulipas.

The [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French occupation]] and reign of Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian]] during the 1860s was difficult for Tamaulipas, at least on the borders and in the city of Tampico. Portions of Tamaulipas supported the republican forces led by President [[Benito Juarez]] in resisting the French, especially in the north. Two years after French occupation began, Tamaulipas as a state finally acceded to Maximilian's rule, and the last French soldiers left the state in 1866, leading up to Maximilian's execution and fall of the [[Second Mexican Empire]] in 1867.

However, the years after Maximilian's defeat were ones of rebuilding and great growth in Tamaulipas. [[International trade]] began to blossom, especially with the coming of the [[Railway|railroad]] to Tampico, which was developing as not only a [[port]] city but also as an industrial and commercial center. The railroad allowed goods to flow quickly from the [[Mining|mines]] and cities of the interior and the Texas border to Tampico for processing and shipment. This, in turn, caused significant growth in towns such as Matamoros and Nuevo Laredo.

Since the [[Mexican Revolution|revolution of 1910]], successive governments have dedicated themselves to building industry and infrastructure in Tamaulipas, including communications and educational systems. Norberto Treviño Zapata founded the state university system, as well as reformed the state oil industry. Marte Gómez provided increased farm sizes for private family farmers. And more recently, Emilio Martínez Manautou led industrial growth. Lately, a push has been to strengthen [[Commercial fishing|fishing]], including efforts to increase the price of fish and [[shellfish]] on the international market.

During the 1970s, [[Colombia]] was experiencing the [[Colombian Conflict]], leading to the rise of illicit criminal organizations like the [[Cali Cartel]] and [[Medellín Cartel]] led by drug traffickers like [[Pablo Escobar]] and [[Fabio Ochoa Vásquez]]. In Mexico, there had already existed various illicit organizations doing drug trafficking like the [[Gulf Cartel]], [[Milenio Cartel]], [[Juaréz Cartel]], [[Guadalajara Cartel]], and a new group of [[vigilante]] drug traffickers called [[La Familia Michoacana]]. The Gulf Cartel was in charge of the State of Tamaulipas and other gulf coast states, leading to the drug trafficking rates going high in the 1990s. Around that time, a group of defectors from the [[Mexican Special Forces]] that participated in the [[Chiapas conflict]] defected as [[Osiel Cárdenas Guillén]] made them promises that they would receive better wages if they worked as the enforcer group of the Gulf Cartel called [[Los Zetas]]. They did incursions in states like [[Michoacán]] and merged La Familia Michoacana as an enforcer group from 2004 to 2006. In 2006, their crimes resulted in the [[Mexican drug war]] and [[Joint Operation Nuevo León-Tamaulipas]].

[[File:Cerros_Sierra_Madre_Oriental.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Sierra Madre Oriental]]]]
The [[Tropic of Cancer]] crosses the southern part of the municipality of Victoria.
The coastal plains along the Gulf have a large presence in the state, whereas inland the landscape is adorned by [[cactus]] species and [[pasture]]. Predominant fauna in the region include the [[cougar]] (''Puma concolor''), [[long-tailed weasel]] (''Mustela frenata''), [[ocelot]] (''Leopardus pardalis''), [[American badger]] (''Taxidea taxus''), [[North American beaver]] (''Castor canadensis''), [[plain chachalaca]] (''Ortalis vetula'') and [[New World quail|quail]].

In the western part of the state, the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] displays warm valleys and high sierras with peaks reaching {{convert|3280|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the Pedragoso Sierra; {{convert|3240|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the Borregos Sierra; {{convert|3220|m|ft|abbr=on}} in La Gloria Sierra; {{convert|3180|m|ft|abbr=on}} in Cerro el Nacimiento; and {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level in the Sierra el Pinal. The [[Sierra de Tamaulipas]] and the [[Sierra de San Carlos]] are isolated mountain ranges in eastern Tamaulipas.

In terms of hydrology, the Bravo, Purificacion, and Guayalejo Rivers flow into the Gulf of Mexico after crossing the state from the western inland. On their way, their basins and zones of influence naturally correspond to the areas destined for agricultural use. The Rio Grande, known to Mexicans as the [[Río Bravo]], represents the northern frontier shared with the United States. One of the tributaries of this natural border, the [[San Juan River (Tamaulipas)|San Juan River]], feeds the {{ill|Marte R. Gómez Dam|es|Presa Marte R. Gómez}}. Agricultural and cattle-raising activities are served by 14 other dams across the state, with a total capacity of {{convert|7,500|e6m3|abbr=unit}} of water.

==Economy==
[[File:Entrada al Puerto de Tampico México.JPG|thumb|200px|Port of Tampico]]
Northern Tamaulipas shares its economic culture with that of [[Texas]], and is primarily characterized by agriculture and strong growth in all industrial sectors. This region is home to many of the [[maquiladora]]s, factories owned by foreign companies but worked by Mexicans, primarily by women. In the state there are important industrial parks such as the [[Oradel Industrial Center]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=La Razón|date=2018-08-20|title=Gobernador de Tamaulipas inaugura la nave del Parque Industrial Oradel|url=https://www.razon.com.mx/mexico/gobernador-de-tamaulipas-inaugura-la-nave-del-parque-industrial-oradel/|journal=https://www.razon.com.mx/mexico/gobernador-de-tamaulipas-inaugura-la-nave-del-parque-industrial-oradel/|access-date=2019-07-09|archive-date=2019-07-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190709225553/https://www.razon.com.mx/mexico/gobernador-de-tamaulipas-inaugura-la-nave-del-parque-industrial-oradel/|url-status=live}}</ref> located in the border city of [[Nuevo Laredo]].

Southern Tamaulipas' economy is primarily based on the [[petrochemical]] industries. There are petrochemical production plants around [[Altamira, Tamaulipas|Altamira]] as well as a principal Gulf coast [[containerization|container]] port, [[Oil refinery|refinery]] facilities in [[Ciudad Madero]] and many oil-industry support service companies in [[Tampico, Tamaulipas|Tampico]], as well as a major [[Break bulk cargo|general]] and [[bulk cargo]] port.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/MEX_Puerto_de_Tampico_237.php |title=Puerto de Tampico |work=Ports in Mexico |publisher=World Port Source |access-date=2009-12-17 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019114608/http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/MEX_Puerto_de_Tampico_237.php |archive-date=2009-10-19 }}</ref> Also of importance are the tourism and fishing industries, as well as much commercial shipping, based in Tampico and Altamira. The little village of [[La Pesca, Tamaulipas|La Pesca]], in the municipality of [[Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas|Soto La Marina]], about midway between [[Brownsville, Texas]] and Tampico, is a rapidly growing tourist area with lovely beaches and excellent fishing both in the Gulf of Mexico and the Rio Soto La Marina. The central zone contains the capital, [[Ciudad Victoria]], and is home to much forestry and farming, as well as some industrial development. About 30% of the population lives here, both in the capital and in [[Ciudad Mante]]. Ciudad Victoria is a significant educational center, home to the [[Universidad Autónoma de Tamaulipas|Autonomous University of Tamaulipas]] (which also has campuses in other cities in the state), the Regional Technical Institute of Ciudad Victoria, the University of Valle de Bravo, and other institutions of learning.

As of the 1990 Mexican census, 13 percent of the homes had only dirt floors, nearly 19 percent had no running water, and over 15 percent of the homes had no electricity. This was better than the national average but was skewed because of the high rate of development in the urban centers. In rural communities in Tamaulipas, access to running water was available in less than 40 percent of homes.

As of 2005, Tamaulipas's economy represents 3.3% of Mexico's total [[gross domestic product]] or 21,664 million USD.<ref name="bancomext">{{cite book | title = Industrial Costs in Mexico – A Guide for Foreign Investors 2007

== Crime ==
This state is known to be the site of a territorial struggle between the [[Gulf Cartel]] and [[Los Zetas]]. The resulting deaths and unresolved kidnappings from the gang violence have been described as a "humanitarian tragedy".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/392130/impone-eu-toque-de-queda-a-sus-empleados-consulares-por-narcoviolencia-en-tamaulipas|title=Impone EU 'toque de queda' a sus empleados consulares por narcoviolencia en Tamaulipas - Proceso|date=4 January 2015|website=proceso.com.mx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171212200134/http://www.proceso.com.mx/392130/impone-eu-toque-de-queda-a-sus-empleados-consulares-por-narcoviolencia-en-tamaulipas|archive-date=12 December 2017|url-status=live|access-date=2 May 2018}}</ref>

The state of Tamaulipas is one of the most affected by violence in the country, mainly caused by organized crime. In February 2010, an armed conflict broke out between the criminal groups known as the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas, resulting in many border cities becoming "ghost towns"; such is the case of the border strip known as "La Frontera Chica" made up of the cities of [[Ciudad Miguel Alemán|Miguel Alemán]], [[Ciudad Mier|Mier]], [[Camargo Municipality, Tamaulipas|Camargo]] and [[Nueva Ciudad Guerrero]].

In November 2010, the Mexican army, together with the Federal Police and the Navy, launched an operation around the north of the state of Tamaulipas, allowing hundreds of families to return to their homes after months of exile in other states, mainly in municipalities like Mier, where around 4,000 people returned.

According to INEGI, in 2012 Tamaulipas contained 9 municipalities with a homicide rate higher than 100 per 100,000 inhabitants: Cruillas (106), San Fernando (175), Llera (159), Mier (156), Güémez (141), Hidalgo (135), Nuevo Laredo (134), González (109) and Soto la Marina (100). On the other hand, the municipalities that had had the most intentional homicides in 2012 were Nuevo Laredo (536 homicides), Victoria (165) and San Fernando (102).

In 2013, 880 homicides were recorded in the state, giving a rate of 25 per 100,000 inhabitants. This placed it that year in the 9th position of the states with the most homicides in Mexico. In 2013, Tamaulipas reached the first national place in kidnappings with 275 known cases and the ninth place in violent highway robbery (68 cases).

As of 2021, Tamaulipas continues to be affected by violence, this being one of the factors that have greatly hindered the economic and social activity of the state. In 2014 it was estimated that the losses due to violence by each company in Tamaulipas reached an average of 95 thousand pesos per year (fourth highest in the country). This placed it above the national average in terms of cost of crime for each company (13,600 pesos against the national average of 12,800).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/pages/radiografia-de-la-violencia-en-tamaulipas.html|title=El Financiero(Lauman Multimedia Group, SAPI de CV).
