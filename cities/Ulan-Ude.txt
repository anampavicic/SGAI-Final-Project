'''Ulan-Ude''' ({{IPAc-en|ʊ|ˈ|l|aː|n|ʊ|ˈ|d|ɛ}};<ref>{{cite web | title=Ulan-Ude definition and meaning | website=Collins English Dictionary | url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/ulan-ude | access-date=10 February 2024}}</ref> {{langx|ru|Улан-Удэ}}, {{IPA|ru|ʊˈlan ʊˈdɛ}}; {{langx|bua|Улаан-Үдэ|Ulaan-Üde}}, {{IPA-all|ʊˌlaːɴ‿ˈʉdə|IPA}}) is the [[capital city]] of [[Buryatia]], [[Russia]], located about {{convert|100|km|sp=us}} southeast of [[Lake Baikal]] on the [[Uda River, Buryatia|Uda River]] at its [[confluence]] with the [[Selenga River|Selenga]]. According to the [[Russian Census (2021)|2021 Census]], 437,565 people lived in Ulan-Ude; up from 404,426 recorded in the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Census]],<ref name="2002Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2002Census}}</ref> making the city the third-largest in the [[Russian Far East]] by population.

==Names==
Ulan-Ude was first called '''Udinskoye''' ({{lang|ru|Удинское}}, {{IPA|ru|ˈudʲɪnskəjə|}}) for its location on the [[Uda River (Republic of Buryatia)|Uda River]]. It was founded as a small fort in 1666.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Verkhne-Udinsk|volume=27|page=1023}}</ref> From around 1735, the settlement was called '''Udinsk''' ({{lang|ru|Удинск}}, {{IPA|ru|ʊˈdʲinsk|}}) and was granted town status under that name in 1775.{{cn|date=November 2020}} It was renamed '''Verkhneudinsk''' ({{lang|ru|Верхнеудинск}}, {{IPA|ru|vʲɪrxnʲɪˈudʲɪnsk|}}; "Upper Udinsk") in 1783, to differentiate it from [[Nizhneudinsk]] ("Lower Udinsk") lying on a different [[Chuna River|Uda River]] near [[Irkutsk]] which was granted town status that year.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

The descriptors "upper" and "lower" refer to the positions of the two cities relative to each other, rather than the location of the cities on their respective Uda rivers. Verkhneudinsk lies at the mouth of its river, while Nizhneudinsk is along the middle stretch. The current name was given to the city on 27 July 1934 and means "[[Red#Political movements|red]] [[Uda River (Republic of Buryatia)|Uda]]" in [[Buryat language|Buryat]], reflecting the [[ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].

==Geography==
Ulan-Ude lies {{convert|5640|km|sp=us}} east of [[Moscow]] and {{convert|100|km|sp=us}} southeast of [[Lake Baikal]]. It is {{convert|600|m|sp=us}} [[above sea level]] at the foot of the [[Khamar-Daban]] and [[Ulan-Burgas]] mountain ranges, next to the [[confluence]] of the [[Selenga River]] and its [[tributary]], the [[Uda River, Buryatia|Uda]], which divides the city.<ref>[https://transsibirskaya.com/cities-ulan-ude ''transsibirskaya.com'']</ref>

===Hydrography===
Ulan-Ude is traversed by two rivers, the Selenga and Uda. The Selenga provides the greatest inflow to [[Baikal Lake]], supplying 50% of all rivers in its basin. The Selenga brings about {{convert|30|km3|0|abbr=off|sp=us}} of water into the lake per year, exerting a major influence on the lakewater's renewal and its sanitary condition. Selenga is the habitat of the most valuable fish species such as [[Omul]], [[Siberian sturgeon]], Siberian [[taimen]], [[Thymallus]] and [[Coregonus]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Uda is the right inflow of the Selenga river. The length of the watercourse is {{convert|467|km|0|abbr=off|sp=us}}.

=== Military depot ===
The largest known Russian military equipment storage base is located in Vagzhanovo, northwest of Ulan-Ude. Prior to the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine|invasion of Ukraine in 2022]], approximately 3840 units of armored vehicles were stored there under open skies. Since the advent of the war, more than 40% of the units have been removed.<ref>{{cite web | title=Moscow Times: Over 40% of tanks removed from Russia’s largest storage site since Ukraine invasion | website=Euromaidan Press | date=8 August 2023 | url=https://euromaidanpress.com/2023/08/08/moscow-times-over-40-of-tanks-removed-from-russias-largest-storage-site-since-ukraine-invasion/?swcfpc=1 | access-date=10 February 2024}}</ref>

A Central Tank Reserve Base, Military Unit 44286, is reported at Divizionnaya, within the Vagzhanovo microdistrict of Ulan Ude.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2014-12-16 |title=Дивизионная - станция в Улан-Удэ |url=http://safe-rgs.ru/2139-divizionnaya-stanciya-v-ulan-ude.html |access-date=2024-03-28 |website=PUTI-shestvuy}}</ref>

==History==
The first occupants of the area where Ulan-Ude now stands were the [[Evenks]] and, later, the [[Buryats|Buryat Mongols]]. Ulan-Ude was settled in 1666 by the Russian [[Cossacks]] as the fortress of Udinskoye. Due to its favorable geographical position, it grew rapidly and became a large trade center which connected Russia with [[China]] and [[Mongolia]] and, from 1690, was the administrative center of the [[Transbaikal]] region.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

By 1775, it was known as Udinsk, and in 1783 it was granted city status and renamed Verkhneudinsk. After a large fire in 1878, the city was almost completely rebuilt. The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] reached the city in 1900 causing an explosion in growth. The population, which was 3,500 in 1880, reached 126,000 in 1939.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/place/Ulan-Ude ''britannica.com'']</ref>

From 6 April to October 1920, [[Verkhneudinsk]] was the capital of the [[w:Far Eastern Republic|Far Eastern Republic (Дальневосточная Республика)]], also known as the Chita Republic.<ref name="Bisher">{{Cite book |last=Bisher |first=Jamie |title=White Terror: Cossack Warlords of the Trans-Siberian |date=June 2005 |isbn=9781135765958 |pages=302–03|publisher=Routledge }}</ref> It was a nominally independent state that existed from April 1920 to November 1922 in the easternmost part of the Russian Far East. On 27 July 1934, the city was renamed Ulan-Ude.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

[[File:Ulan Ude tram map 2021.png|thumb|315x315px|Map of city's tram routes as of October 2021]]
The city also lies on the M55 section of the [[Baikal Highway]] (part of the [[Trans-Siberian Highway]]), the main federal road to [[Vladivostok]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Air traffic is served by the [[Ulan-Ude Airport]] (Baikal), as well as the smaller [[Ulan-Ude Vostochny Airport]]. Intracity transport includes [[tram]], [[bus]], and ''[[marshrutka]]'' ([[share taxi]]) lines.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Culture==
Until 1991, Ulan-Ude was [[Closed city|closed to foreigners]]. There are old merchants' mansions richly decorated with wood and stone carving in the historical center of Ulan-Ude, along the river banks which are exceptional examples of Russian classicism. The city has a large ethnographic museum which recalls the history of the peoples of the region. There is a large and highly unusual statue of the head of [[Vladimir Lenin]] in the central square: the largest in the world. Built in 1970 for the centennial of Lenin's birth and weighing 42 tons, {{asof|2018|lc=y}} it continued to tower over the main plaza at {{convert|7.7|m|ft|sp=us}}.<ref name="LeninMonument">{{Cite web |script-title=ru:Памятник В. И. Ленину |url=http://www.monulent.ru/monument.php?id=00000000013 |access-date=17 April 2018 |publisher=Monulent.ru |language=ru}}</ref>

==Sights==
The ''[[Ulan-Ude Ethnographic Museum|Ethnographic Museum]] of the peoples of [[Transbaikal]]'' is one of Russia's largest open-air museums. The museum contains historical finds from the era of the [[Slab Grave Culture]] and the [[Xiongnu]] until the mid 20th century, including a unique collection of samples of wooden architecture of [[Siberia]].

[[Odigitrievsky Cathedral]] – [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] Diocese of the Buryat, was the first stone building in the city and is a Siberian [[baroque]] architectural monument. The cathedral is considered unique because it is built in a zone of high seismic activity in the heart of the city on the banks of the River Uda River where it flows into the Selenga.

One of the attractions of Ulan-Ude is a monument in the town square&nbsp;— the square of the Soviets&nbsp;— in the form of the head of Lenin (sculptors G.V. Neroda, J.G. Neroda, architects Dushkin, P.G. Zilberman). The monument, weighing 42 tons and with a height of {{convert|7.7|m|ft|sp=us}}, was opened in 1971 in honor of the centenary of Lenin's birth.<ref name="LeninMonument" />

==Climate==
Ulan-Ude can be described as possessing a humid [[semi-arid climate|steppe climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BSk''), bordering on a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dwb'') and a [[subarctic climate]] (''Dwc''). The climate is characterised by long, dry, bitterly cold winters and short but very warm summers. Precipitation is low and heavily concentrated in the warmer months.
