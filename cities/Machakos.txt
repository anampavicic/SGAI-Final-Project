==History==
Machakos was established in 1887 by Sakshi Shah, ten years before Nairobi. Machakos was designated as the first administrative centre when the British [[British East Africa|established their colony]] here in the late 19th century. Machakos town is on hilly terrain surrounded by Iveti hills.

In 1899 the British shifted the capital to Nairobi, after Machakos was bypassed by construction of the [[Uganda Railway]]. <ref>{{Cite web |last=Muthoni |first=Kamau |title=Place of Machakos in Kenya's rich history |url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/eastern/article/2000220495/place-of-machakos-in-kenyas-rich-history |access-date=8 June 2023 |website=The Standard |language=en}}</ref> 

Technically Machakos is the oldest administrative municipality in east and central Africa. Prominent politicians from the town included: Mwatu wa Ngoma, [[Paul Ngei|Paul Joseph Ngei]], Mutisya Mulu and [[Johnson Muthama|Johnson Nduya Muthama]]. The county and its town were named after Masaku wa Munyati, a [[Kamba people|Kamba]] tribal chief who migrated and settled here in 1816 from the area near [[Sultan Hamud]].

At the turn of the 21st century, peace talks were held here in an effort to settle the [[Sudan]] civil war. The ''[[Machakos Protocol]]'' was published on 20 July 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Machakos Protocol {{!}} UN Peacemaker|url=https://peacemaker.un.org/sudan-machakos-protocol2002|website=peacemaker.un.org|access-date=30 May 2020|archive-date=6 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506123542/http://peacemaker.un.org/sudan-machakos-protocol2002|url-status=live}}</ref>
