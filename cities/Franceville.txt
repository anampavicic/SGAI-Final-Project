'''Franceville''' is one of the four largest cities in [[Gabon]], with a population of 110,568 at the 2013 census. It lies on the [[River Mpassa|Mpassa River]] and at the end of the [[Trans-Gabon Railway]] and the [[N3 road (Gabon)|N3 road]]. It grew from a village named Masuku.

== Overview ==
[[Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza]] chose the village of Masuku to resettle former slaves and renamed it Francheville (meaning "city of the freed") in 1880. This name later was modified to Franceville, after the country’s former ruler (meaning "city of France").<ref>[http://www.french.xinhuanet.com/french/2005-05/21/content_117489.htm "Gabon : Franceville s'apprête à célébrer son 125ème anniversaire"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718102847/http://www.french.xinhuanet.com/french/2005-05/21/content_117489.htm |date=2011-07-18 }}, Xinhua, May 21, 2005 {{in lang|fr}}.</ref>

Features of the town include [[St Hilaire's Church]] (built in 1899), a large statue of President [[Omar Bongo]] (who was born in Franceville), a [[primate]] [[medical research]] institute, and a golf course. Its [[M'Vengue El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba International Airport|airport]] is {{Convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on|sp=us}} west, in [[Mvengué]]. Bongo was buried in Franceville on June 18, 2009.

There is a market where numerous items can be purchased, including clothing, fruit and vegetables, electronics, meats, and the market also sells [[bushmeat]], which includes [[African Rock Python|Central African rock python]], [[monkey]] and local species of animals.

There are a few hotels, of which the best known is the Hôtel Poubara, overlooking the president's holiday home.

Franceville also has many waterfalls. One of the best known is the [[Poubara Falls]], which is co-located with a hydroelectric plant that provides the area with constant electricity.
