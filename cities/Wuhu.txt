During the time of the Qin dynasty, Jiuzi was placed under the jurisdiction of the Zhang Commandery ({{Lang-zh|c=鄣郡|p=Zhāng Jùn}}).<ref name=":0" /> In 109 BCE, Zhang Commandery was renamed to {{Interlanguage link|Danyang Commandery|zh|丹杨郡}}.<ref name=":0" /> During this time, the area of Juizi was reorganized as Wuhu County ({{Lang-zh|s=芜湖县|t=蕪湖縣|p=Wúhú Xiàn}}).<ref name=":0" /> In 223 CE, under the reign of [[Sun Quan]] of the [[Eastern Wu]], the county seat was moved from the site of Jiuzi to the highlands along the north banks of the [[Qingyi River (Anhui)|Qingyi River]], to the southeast of contemporary Wuhu's urban core.<ref name=":0" />

In 937 CE, upon the creation of the [[Southern Tang]] during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]], Wuhu County was established, and placed under {{Interlanguage link|Jiangning Fu|zh|江宁府}}.<ref name=":0" /> Since then, Wuhu went uninterrupted as an administrative unit throughout the remainder of dynastic China.<ref name=":0" />

Most of the downtown area alongside the Yangtze River was ceded in the British concession.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}

Upon the establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in 1912, Fu, Prefectures, and Ting were established, and counties were placed under direct provincial jurisdiction.<ref name=":0" /> Wuhu County was directly governed by Anhui province from 1912 until 1914, when {{Interlanguage link|Wuhu Circuit|zh|芜湖道}} was established to govern 23 counties in the area, including Wuhu County, until 1928.<ref name=":0" /> Trade in rice, wood, and tea flourished at Wuhu until the [[Warlord Era]] of the 1920s and 1930s, when [[bandits]] were active in the area.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}} In 1932, Wuhu County was placed under the jurisdiction of the Second Administrative Division of Anhui province ({{Lang-zh|c=安徽省第二专区|p=Ānhuī Shěng Dì Èr Zhuānqū}}).<ref name=":0" />

At the beginning of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], part of the [[Second World War]], Wuhu was occupied by Japan on December 10, 1937.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}} This was a prelude to the [[Battle of Nanking|Battle of Nanjing]], ending in the [[Nanjing massacre]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}} Under Japanese occupation, Chinese resistance fighters hid in the lakes around Wuhu by submerging themselves and breathing through reeds.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}} In early 1938, Japan moved Wuhu County from the Second Administrative Division to the Fifth Administrative Division.<ref name=":0" /> On October 25, 1938, they transferred Wuhu County to the Ninth Administrative Division.<ref name=":0" /> Japan had again changed the region's divisions in August 1941, and placed Wuhu County under the Sixth Administrative Division.<ref name=":0" />

From December 1, 1967, to April 1, 1968, during the tumult of the [[Cultural Revolution]], Wuhu was placed under [[Martial law|military rule]].<ref name=":0" />

Major industries began to be developed in Wuhu after the Second World War, with the development of the textile industry, shipbuilding, and paper mills.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}} Despite this, Wuhu had been lagging behind [[Ma'anshan]] and [[Tongling]] in industrial production for decades after the [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|establishment of the People's Republic of China]] and remained primarily a commercial center for trade in rice, silk, cotton, tea, wheat and eggs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}} However, with recent years' economic rise, Wuhu has become a hub for manufacturing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}

==Culture==
The acclaimed poet [[Li Bai]] spent his late life in Wuhu, it is said, due to its striking landscape. Li Bai was born in [[Suyab]], an ancient [[Silk Road]] city in Central Asian, and raised in southwestern China. [[Xie Tiao]], one of the most distinctive [[Six Dynasty]] poets whom he greatly admired, left many poems when holding positions here.

During the [[Tang dynasty]] (619–907), the poet [[Du Mu]] wrote a famous poem ''Thoughts on Staying Again at Wuhu''.

A factory in Wuhu carries on the local craft of making [[wrought iron]] pictures. Other local handicrafts are embossed [[lacquerware]] and rice [[straw patchwork|straw pith patchwork]]. A famous stone tablet in Wuhu recording local events of the [[Song dynasty]] period (ca. 1000 AD) is considered to be a masterpiece of the renowned calligrapher [[Mi Fu]]. 

===Folklore===
An itinerant blacksmith named [[Tang Tianchi]] is reputed to have invented the wrought-iron picture in Wuhu, when a painter whom he admired chided him, "You will never make pictures by beating iron."

Another blacksmith of the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (770–476 BC) named [[Gan Jiang]] was famous for sword making. Zhe Shan (Reddish Brown Hill) is said to get its colour from the flames of Gan Jiang's furnace. [[Shen Shan]] (Sacred Hill) is the legendary location of his sword grinding rock and tempering pool.

===Cuisine===
Wuhu and [[Anqing]] are noted centers of the [[Yanjiang cuisine]]. It specializes in freshwater fish and poultry, and features special techniques of chopping, shaping, and colouring. The flavour of Yanjiang dishes is often enhanced by sweetening and smoking.

===Religion/Medicine===

The New York Methodist Mission Society's Superintendent [[Virgil C. Hart]] arrived in Wuhu in 1881, intent on purchasing a piece of property to build the city's first Methodist Church and Western-style hospital. Hart was able to secure the [[Yichisan Hill]] before the British, who wanted the property to build a consulate and naval base{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}. The [[Yichisan Hospital]] is Anhui's oldest/continuous western hospital. [[Dr. Edgerton H. Hart]] (V.C. Hart's eldest son) became the hospital's Director in 1895 and continued at that capacity until his death in April 1913.<ref>"Man On A Mission" by Stanley Crawford</ref> [[Caroline Maddock]] arrived in Wuhu in October 1904, to serve as the General Hospital's Head Nurse. Caroline Maddock married Dr. Edgerton Hart in October 1907. In 1909, Caroline and four other nurses founded the Nurses Association of China and she served as its first president; this association still represents China's Nurse profession.<ref>{{cite web |title=About Yijishan Hospital |url=https://www.yjsyy.com/cn/About/index_13.aspx |website=First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College |access-date=May 14, 2022 |ref=HospitalofWannanAnhui}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Crawford Green |first1=Cathleen |last2=Crawford |first2=Stanley |last3=Maddock Hart |first3=Caroline |title=Wuhu Missionaries |date=May 1, 2014 |publisher=Eye Soar, Inc |isbn=9780991608232 |pages=262 |ref=WuhuMissionariesBook}}</ref>
