'''Lutsk''' ({{langx|uk|Луцьк}}, {{IPA|uk|lut͡sʲk|IPA|audio=Uk-Луцьк.ogg}}; see [[#Names and etymology|below]] for other names) is a city on the [[Styr River]] in northwestern [[Ukraine]]. It is the [[administrative center]] of [[Volyn Oblast]] and the administrative center of [[Lutsk Raion]] within the oblast. Lutsk has a population of {{Ua-pop-est2022|220,986|.}} Historically it was a cultural and religious center in [[Volhynia]].

==Names and etymology==
Lutsk is an ancient [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] town, mentioned in the [[Hypatian Chronicle]] as '''Luchesk''' in the records of 1085. The etymology of the name is unclear. There are three hypotheses: the name may have been derived from the Old Slavic word ''luka'' (an arc or bend in a river), or the name may have originated from ''Luka'' (the chieftain of the ''[[Dulebs]]''), an ancient Slavic tribe living in this area. The name may also have been created after ''Luchanii'' (Luchans), an ancient branch of the tribe mentioned above. Its historical name in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] is "Луцьк".

The city of Lutsk is also historically known by different names in other languages – {{langx|pl|Łuck}}, {{IPA|pl|wutsk|IPA}}; {{langx|yi|לוצק ,לויצק|Loytzk, Loutsk}}; as well as [[Names of European cities in different languages (I–L) #L|a number of other names]].<ref name="Beider">{{cite journal |last1=Beider |first1=Alexander |title=Eastern Yiddish Toponyms of German Origin |journal=Yiddish Studies Today |date=2012 |volume=ISBN 978-3-943460-09-4; ISSN 2194-8879 |issue=düsseldorf university press, Düsseldorf 2012 |url=https://docserv.uni-duesseldorf.de/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-23711/27_Leket_Beider_Eastern_Yiddish_Toponyms_of_German_Origin_A.pdf |access-date=26 December 2023}}</ref>

==History==
According to the legend, Luchesk dates from the 7th century. The first known documentary reference dates were from the year 1085. In the 11th century, along with the region of Volhynia, the town was contested by the [[Kyivan Rus']] and [[Poland]].{{sfn|Nieć|1937|p=226}} The town served as the capital of the [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia|Principality of Halych-Volynia]] (founded in 1199) until the rise of [[Volodymyr (city)|Volodymyr]]. The town grew around a wooden stronghold built by a local branch of the [[Rurik Dynasty]]. At certain times the location functioned as the capital of the principality, but the town did not become an important centre of commerce or culture. 

===Grand Duchy of Lithuania===
In 1240, [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongols seized and looted]] the nearby town but left the castle unharmed. In 1321, George, son of [[Leo II of Galicia|Lev]], the last prospective heir of Halych-Volynia, died in a battle with the forces of [[Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania]], and [[Lithuania]]n forces seized the castle. In 1349, the forces of King [[Casimir III of Poland]] captured the town, then Lithuania soon retook it, but it remained contested by Lithuania and Poland until 1382.{{sfn|Nieć|1937|p=226}}

[[File:Colored postcards with views of Lutsk (1916) 05.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lubart's Castle]] on a postcard from 1916]]
The town began to prosper during the period of Lithuanian rule. Prince [[Liubartas|Lubart]] (died 1384), son of [[Gediminas]], erected [[Lubart's Castle]] as part of his fortification programme. From 1385, it was part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian union]], yet it remained an object of Lithuanian-Polish rivalry. Polish King [[Władysław II Jagiełło]] appointed Polish [[starost]]s, brought in [[Dominican Order|Dominican monks]] and staffed the Catholic bishopric, intending to connect it to the Polish [[Archdiocese of Lwów]], while Lithuanian Duke [[Vytautas]] sought to diminish Polish influence and develop the city to become Lithuania's second capital after [[Vilnius]].{{sfn|Nieć|1937|p=227}} Vytautas invited colonists (mostly [[Jews]], [[Tatars]], and [[Crimean Karaites]]).{{sfn|Nieć|1937|p=227}} In 1427 he transferred the Catholic bishopric from Volodymyr to Luchesk. Vytautas was the last monarch to use the title of "Duke of Volhynia" and to reside in Lubart's Castle. 

The town grew rapidly, and by the end of the 15th century, there were 19 Orthodox and two Catholic churches. It was the seat of two [[christianity|Christian]] bishops, one Catholic and one Orthodox. Because of that, the town was sometimes nicknamed "the ''Volhynian Rome''." The cross symbol of Lutsk features the highest Lithuanian Presidential award, the [[Order of Vytautas the Great]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1429 Lutsk was the meeting place selected for a [[European congress in Lutsk|conference of monarchs]] hosted by [[Władysław II Jagiełło]] and [[Sophia of Halshany]] to deal with the Tatar threat. Those invited to attend included [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund, King of Hungary and Bohemia]]; Grand Duke [[Vasili II of Russia]]; [[Eric of Pomerania]], king of [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]; the Grand Master of the [[Livonian Order]] Zisse von Rutenberg; the Duke of [[Szczecin]] [[Kazimierz V]]; [[Dan II of Wallachia|Dan II]], the ''Hospodar'' of [[Wallachia]]; and [[Prince-elector]]s of most of the countries of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

===Kingdom of Poland===
In 1432, Volhynia became a [[fief]] of the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]] and Lutsk became the seat of the governors, and later the Marshalls of the Land of Volhynia. That same year, the city was granted [[Magdeburg rights]] by King Władysław II Jagiełło.{{sfn|Nieć|1937|p=228}} It was one of the minor centers of [[Armenians in Poland]], with an Armenian church.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stopka|first=Krzysztof|editor-last1=Kopczyński|editor-first1=Michał|editor-last2=Tygielski|editor-first2=Wojciech|year=2010|title=Pod wspólnym niebem.

After the [[Union of Lublin]], the local Orthodox bishop converted to [[Eastern Catholicism]].

The city continued to prosper as an important economic centre of the region. By the mid-17th century, Łuck had approximately 50,000 inhabitants and was one of the largest towns in the area. During the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], the town was seized by the forces of Colonel Kolodko. Up to 4,000 people were slaughtered, approximately 35,000 fled, and the city was looted and partially burnt. It never fully recovered. In 1781, the city was struck by a fire which destroyed 440 houses, both cathedrals, and several other churches. In 1788, Łuck was the 25th largest city of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].{{sfn|Nieć|1937|p=230}} The city embraced the [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]].{{sfn|Nieć|1937|p=230}}

===Russian Empire===
In 1795, as a result of the [[Third Partition of Poland]], the [[Russian Empire]] annexed Lutsk. The Voivodeship was liquidated and the town lost its significance as the capital of the province (which was moved to [[Zhytomyr]]). After the [[November Uprising]] (1830–1831), efforts increased to remove Polish influence. Polish schools were closed in 1831 and Catholic monasteries were seized in 1840–1853.{{sfn|Nieć|1937|p=231}} Russian became the dominant language in official circles. Though, the Ukrainian population continued to speak [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]; the Polish population spoke [[Polish language|Polish]]; and the Jewish population spoke [[Yiddish]] (only in private circles). The [[Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic churches]] was turned into [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Christian]] ones, which led to the self-liquidation of the Uniates here. In 1845, another great fire struck the city, resulting in further depopulation.

In 1850, three major forts were built around Lutsk, and the town became a small fortress called ''Mikhailogorod''. Neglected under Russian rule, by the late 19th century, the city lost its leading economic position in Volhynia to [[Rivne]], [[Kovel]] and [[Zdolbuniv]].{{sfn|Nieć|1937|p=231}}

[[File:Colored postcards with views of Lutsk (Gorokhovsky) 07.jpg|thumb|Postcard from the 1910s]]
During the [[First World War]], the town was seized by [[Austria-Hungary]] on 29 August 1915. The town sustained a small amount of damage. During more than a year of Austro-Hungarian occupation, Lutsk became an important military centre with the headquarters of the IV Army under Archduke [[Archduke Josef Ferdinand, Prince of Tuscany|Josef Ferdinand]] stationed there. A plague of [[epidemic typhus]] decimated the city's inhabitants.

On 4 June 1916, four Russian armies under general [[Aleksei Brusilov]] started what later became known as the [[Brusilov Offensive]]. After up to three days of heavy artillery barrage, the [[Battle of Lutsk]] began. On 7 June 1916 the Russian forces reconquered the city. After the signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] in 1917, the city was seized by Germany on 7 February 1918. On 22 February 1918 the town was transferred by the withdrawing German army to the forces loyal to [[Symon Petlura]].

===Second Polish Republic===
During the [[Polish-Bolshevik War]], on 16 May 1919, Lutsk was taken over by the forces of Poland's [[Blue Army (Poland)|Blue Army]] after a heavy battle with the [[Red Army]]. The city was devastated and largely depopulated. It witnessed the Soviet counter-offensive of 1920 and was taken on 12 July 1920. It was recaptured by Poland's 45th Rifles regiment and field artillery on 15 September 1920.<ref name="Tomczyk">{{cite web | url=http://www.osadnicy.org/tomczyk24.htm | title=Łuck - Miasto bliskie sercom naszym | publisher=Stowarzyszenie Rodzin Osadników Wojskowych i Cywilnych Kresów Wschodnich | work=Kresowe Stanice | year=2013 | access-date=18 June 2013 | author=Antoni Tomczyk}}</ref> According to American sociologist Alexander Gella "the Polish victory [over the Red Army] had gained twenty years of independence not only for Poland but at least for an entire central part of Europe.<ref name="Gella">Aleksander Gella (1988), ''Development of Class Structure in Eastern Europe: Poland and Her Southern Neighbors'', SUNY Press, {{ISBN|978-0-88706-833-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8keIXDyF_EoC&pg=PA23 Google Print, p. 23.]</ref> Łuck was designated by the newly-reborn nation of [[Poland]] as the capital of the [[Wołyń Voivodeship (1921–1939)|Wołyń Voivodeship]].

The city was connected by railroad to [[Lviv]] (then Lwów) and [[Przemyśl]]. Several brand new factories were built both in Łuck and on its outskirts producing farming equipment, wood, and leather products among other consumer goods. New mills and [[breweries]] opened. An orphanage was built, and a big new bursary. The first high school was soon inaugurated. In 1937, an airport was established in Łuck with an area of {{convert|69|ha|acre}}.<ref name="Tomczyk" /> 

The 13th ''Kresowy'' Light Artillery Regiment was stationed in the city, together with a ''Łuck'' [[National Defense (Poland)]] Battalion. In 1938, construction of a large modern radio transmitter began in the city (see [[Polish Radio Łuck]]). As of 1 January 1939 Łuck had 39,000 inhabitants (approximately 17,500 Jews and 13,500 Poles). The powiat formed around the town had 316,970 inhabitants, including 59% Ukrainians, 19.5% Poles, 14% Jews and approximately 23,000 [[Czechs]] and [[German people|Germans]].

===World War II===
[[File:07-101-0018 a.jpg|thumb|left|Site of the [[NKVD prisoner massacre in Lutsk|NKVD prisoner massacre of 1941]]]]
On Thursday 7 September 1939, at about 5 p.m., the Polish government, which had left [[Warsaw]] the day before, arrived at Łuck. German intelligence quickly found out about it, and the city was twice bombed by the [[Luftwaffe]], on 11 and 14 September. After panzer units of the [[Wehrmacht]] had crossed the [[Bug river]], on 14 September the government of Poland left Łuck and headed southwards, to [[Kosiv|Kosów Huculski]], which at that time was located near the Polish–Romanian border.

As a result of the [[invasion of Poland]] from both sides and the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], Łuck, along with the rest of western Volyn, was annexed by the Soviet Union. Most of the factories (including the almost-finished radio station) were dismantled and sent east to Russia. Approximately 10,000 of the city's Polish inhabitants (chiefly ethnic Poles, but also [[Polish Jews]]) were deported in cattle trucks to [[Kazakhstan]] and 1,550 were arrested by the [[NKVD]].<ref name="Piotrowski1998">Tadeusz Piotrowski (1998), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NBbnrEMswbUC&q=Luck Poland's Holocaust]'' (Google Books).

===Postwar===
[[File:ЛуцькВолі60.jpg|thumb|left|Lutsk in the 1960s]]
After the end of the war, the remaining Polish inhabitants of the city were expelled, mostly to the areas that are sometimes referred to as the Polish [[Regained Territories]]. The city became an industrial centre in the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. The major changes in the city's demographics had the final result that by the end of the war, the city was almost entirely Ukrainian. During the [[Cold War]], the city hosted the [[Lutsk (air base)|Lutsk air base]].

As one of the largest cities in western Ukraine, Lutsk became the seat of the General Consulate of Poland in 2003.<ref>

On 21 July 2020, a [[Lutsk hostage crisis|hostage crisis]] took place, involving a man armed with a firearm and explosives who stormed a bus and took 16 people [[hostage]] at about 9:25 a.m. Police said that they had identified the hostage-taker and that he had expressed dissatisfaction with "Ukraine's system" on social media. [[Ukrainian President]] [[Volodymyr Zelenskyy]] said that shots gas had been heard and that the bus had been damaged. The incident led to police blocking off the city centre. The standoff was eventually resolved after several hours, with all of the hostages being freed and the hostage taker being arrested.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://apnews.com/9f60460ff774acb4a40a0c5198bd072c|title=Police: Armed man holding some 20 people hostage in Ukraine|publisher=Associated Press|date=21 July 2020|access-date=21 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-hostages/shots-heard-as-bus-passengers-taken-hostage-in-western-ukraine-idUSKCN24M0UH|title=Shots heard as bus passengers taken hostage in western Ukraine|publisher=Reuters|date=21 July 2020|access-date=21 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53489527|title=Ukraine hostage crisis: Police in Lutsk end stand-off|work=BBC News|date=21 July 2020|access-date=21 July 2020}}</ref>
