== Overview ==
According to the Brazilian [[census]] in 2022 the town had 244,911 inhabitants.

The city is growing quickly because many industries settled there and the [[soybean]] plantation is considered{{by whom|date=November 2014}} a "new gold rush" in the region, attracting emigrants from distant regions of [[Brazil]]. These people are from the South and Southeast regions who used to work with [[cattle ranching]]. The farming is extensive and very automated compared to other parts of Brazil. The farms are interesting as when the industry was labor-intensive the owners built small villages around the main house for the workers. These "villages" were self-contained and included schools and medical facilities. Rarely used now for their original purpose many still stand. They are seen as an island surrounded by trees in the middle of soy bean plants stretching to the horizon.

In August 2007 the Italian [[wind orchestra]] ''Orchestra Fiati Giovanile Italiana e Coro "I Music Piemonteis"'' conducted by Ugo Bairo, and his [[choir]], conducted by [[Carmelo Luca Sambataro]] performed there. There he premiered his wind composition dedicated to the local government: ''The [[Mato Grosso]] [[March (music)|March]]''.
The city is situated on the [[Cerrado]], high tableland intersected by deep gorges containing [[butte]] and [[mesa]] formations.

The city is also the jumping off point for tourists and sportsmen visiting the Northern [[Pantanal]]. Rondonópolis has a domestic airport, [[Rondonópolis Airport|Maestro Marinho Franco Municipal Airport]].
