'''Puebla de Zaragoza''' ({{IPA|es|ˈpweβla}}; {{langx|nah|Cuetlaxcoapan}}; {{Langx|ote|Nde'ma}}), formally '''Heroica Puebla de Zaragoza''', formerly '''Puebla de los Ángeles''' during colonial times, or known simply as '''Puebla''', is the seat of [[Puebla Municipality]]. It is the capital and largest city of the state of [[Puebla]], and the [[List of cities in Mexico#Top 100 cities by population|fourth largest city in Mexico]], after [[Mexico City]], [[Monterrey]], and [[Guadalajara]]. A [[New Spain|viceregal era]] [[planned city]], it is located in the southern part of Central Mexico on the main route between Mexico City and Mexico's main [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] port, [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]]—about {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} east southeast of Mexico City and about {{convert|220|km|abbr=on}} west of Veracruz.<ref>Julia Hirshberg, "Social Experiments in New Spain: A Prosopographical Study of the Early Settlement at Puebla de Los Angeles, 1531-1534" , Hispanic American Historical Review vol. 59, 1979.</ref>

The city was founded in 1531 in an area called Cuetlaxcoapan, which means "where serpents change their skin", between two of the main indigenous settlements at the time, [[Tlaxcala]] and [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]].<ref name="fundpuebla">{{Cite web |url=http://www.elclima.com.mx/fundacion_e_historia_de_puebla.htm |title= Fundación e historia de Puebla |publisher=El Clima |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Foundation and history of Puebla |access-date=2009-10-21}}</ref> This valley was not populated in the 16th century, as in the [[pre-Columbian|pre-Hispanic period]] this area was primarily used for the "[[flower war]]s" between a number of populations.<ref name="fondapueblab">{{cite journal |last1=Barbosa Cano |first1=Manlio |year=2000 |title=Puebla.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Puebla|List of buildings in Puebla City}}

===Pre-Columbian era===
[[File:Fundación de la Puebla 004.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Writ to recognize Puebla as City signed by Spain's queen [[Isabella of Portugal]], municipal archive]]

Some historians consider that the area where the city is located nowadays was not inhabited in the [[Pre-Columbian era]], except in the 15th century, when this valley was set aside for use for the so-called [[Flower wars]] among the populations of [[Itzocan]], [[Tepeaca]], [[Huejotzingo]], [[San Martín Texmelucan|Texmelucan]] and [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]], with those soldiers captured being used as sacrifice victims.<ref name="encmuc"/>

The foundation of Puebla begins with a letter from the bishop of Tlaxcala in 1530, Julián Garcés, to the Spanish queen outlining the need for a Spanish settlement between Mexico City and the port of Veracruz.<ref name="gobhistoria">{{Cite web |url=http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=168:ciudad-de-puebla&catid=36:Fundaci%C3%B3n-de-Ciudades&Itemid=60 |title=Ciudad de Puebla |first=Luis Alberto |last=Martínez Álvarez |publisher=Government of Puebla |language=es |trans-title=City of Puebla |date=2009-04-24 |access-date=2009-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927155746/http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=168:ciudad-de-puebla&catid=36:Fundaci%C3%B3n-de-Ciudades&Itemid=60 |archive-date=27 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to legend, the bishop had a dream about where to build the city. In this dream, he saw a valley with woods and meadows crossed by a clear river and dotted with fresh-water springs on fertile land. While he was contemplating this scenery, he supposedly saw a group of angels descend from heaven and trace out the city. Convinced he had seen a divine vision, he celebrated [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and took some of the brothers out in search of the place. Five leagues from the monastery he declared they had found the place shown in the dream. This legend is the source of Puebla's original name, Puebla de los Ángeles, and its current nickname [[Angelópolis (Puebla)|Angelópolis]] (literally, ''City of Angels'').<ref name="fundpuebla"/><ref name="moritzky">{{Cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/934-puebla-and-then-south |title= Puebla And Then South |first=Charles E. |last=Moritzky |publisher=Mexconnect |date=2006-01-01 |access-date=2009-10-21}}</ref>

===Coat of arms===
The city's coat of arms refers to a city (the castle with 5 towers) which is protected by angels; the letters K. V. refer to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] ({{Langx|la|Karolus V}}), also referred to as Charles I of Spain; below are 7 rivers which cross the city.

The city was founded in 1531 within the Valley of Cuetlaxcoapan as a Spanish city, not on the foundation of an existing indigenous city-state. The official date of foundation is 16 April 1531, however, this first attempt at settlement failed due to constant flooding of the site right next to the river.<ref name="gobhistoria"/> Several rivers flow through the Valley of Puebla, the San Francisco, [[Balsas River|Atoyac]] and the Alseseca. This valley was bordered by the indigenous city-states turned colonial towns of [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], [[Tlaxcala]], [[Huejotzingo]] and [[Tepeaca]], all of which had large indigenous populations. After the city's foundation, this valley became the main route between Mexico City and Veracruz, the port on the Caribbean coast and the connection to Spain.

Puebla was an important city and region in the history of [[New Spain]], since it was in the center region of Spanish settlement, midway between the main port and the capital, had a large indigenous population, and drew many Spanish settlers. It supplied the capital with commercially grown agricultural products and became a center of local textile production.<ref>Guy P.C. Thomson, Puebla de Los Angeles: Industry and Society in a Mexican City, 1700-1850. Westview Press 1989.</ref> It was well connected to Mexico's North, particularly the silver-mining region around Zacatecas.

Most of the population moved away from the west bank of the San Francisco River to a higher site. A few families remained behind and renamed the original settlement Alto de San Francisco. The [[Spanish Crown]] supported the founding of Puebla as a city without [[encomienda]]s, as this system was being abused and a number of Spaniards were finding themselves landless. Puebla received its coat-of-arms in 1538, and the titles "Noble y Leal" (Noble and Loyal) in 1558, "Muy Noble y Leal Ciudad" (Very Noble and Loyal City) in 1561 and "Muy Noble y Muy Leal Ciudad" (Very Noble and Very Loyal City) in 1576.<ref name="gobhistoria"/>

The layout of the city is of classic Spanish design, centered on a main plaza, today called the [[Zócalo (Puebla)|Zócalo]]. This main plaza originally was rectangular, but later made square because the earlier version was considered to be ugly. Another major feature of the city were the weekly markets ([[tianguis]]), in which indigenous sellers would come with their wares and foodstuffs to sell to the population. By the mid-16th century, water was brought in to the main plaza to a newly installed fountain. By the end of the century, the city occupied 120 blocks, much of which was under construction, with the new [[Puebla Cathedral|Cathedral]] begun in 1575.<ref name="gobhistoria"/> During the [[Iberian Union|Union of Spain and Portugal]] (1580–1640), the city developed a sizeable Portuguese community. Trade ties with Portugal and a growing economy made the city an entrepôt for the [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic slave trade]] during the early 1600s.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Urban Slavery in Colonial Mexico |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-30424-5 |pages=107–143 |chapter=The Puebla Slave Market, 1600–1700 |doi=10.1017/9781108304245.005 |chapter-url=https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108304245.005}}</ref>

Puebla's favorable climate and strategic location helped the city to prosper, quickly becoming the second most important city in [[New Spain]].<ref name="fundpuebla" /> [[Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla]], the preeminent 17th-century composer in the New World, spent most of his life at the cathedral, from about 1620 to 1664.

The city council of Puebla, being made up of only Spaniards, had a certain amount of autonomy in the politics of the city and the land under its jurisdiction. This council annexed the towns of [[Amozoc de Mota|Amozoc]], Totimehuacán, and Cuautinchán to its territory in 1755. By 1786, Puebla's lands reached from what is now Veracruz to [[Guerrero]] states.<ref name="encmuc"/> The city continued to grow and be more regulated during the 17th and 18th centuries. A new city hall was built in 1714 and the tianguis in the main plaza was replaced by wood stalls by the 1770s. The streets were paved with stone between 1786 and 1811.<ref name="gobhistoria"/>

Commercial activity was dislodged from the main plaza completely by the early 19th century and placed in the San Francisco Parian market. Other plazas, such as the San Luis, San Antonio, El Carmen, La Concordia and Santa Inés were built. The main plaza underwent several transformations, adding statues and gardens.<ref name="gobhistoria"/> During the [[Mexican War of Independence]], Puebla's main role was the printing and distribution of the plan for independence.<ref name="fundpuebla"/> In 1827, after Independence, all Spaniards (''[[peninsulares]]'') were expelled from the city's lands.<ref name="sucesos">{{Cite web |url=http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=154:sucesos-historicos-de-puebla&catid=32:sucesos-historicos&Itemid=56 |title=Suceso históricos |first=Luis Alberto |last=Martínez Álvarez |publisher=Government of Puebla |language=es |trans-title=Historic Events |date=2009-04-24 |access-date=2009-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927155806/http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=154:sucesos-historicos-de-puebla&catid=32:sucesos-historicos&Itemid=56 |archive-date=27 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Early Republican era===
In 1847, the city was [[Siege of Puebla (1847)|taken by U.S. forces]] under General [[Winfield Scott]], without a shot fired. The American garrison was [[Siege of Puebla (1847)|besieged]] in the city from 14 September – 12 October 1847 by the irregular forces of General [[Joaquín Rea]] and later reinforced by [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]]. The siege was broken by the force of General [[Joseph Lane]] that fought its way from [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]] into the city after defeating Santa Ana in the [[Battle of Huamantla]] on 9 October 1847. Puebla was then the base for General Lane's campaign against General Rea and the other guerrillas that harassed the U. S. Army line of communications. These forces left in July 1848 after the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] was ratified.<ref name="sucesos"/>

During the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French intervention in Mexico]] on 5 May 1862 in the [[Battle of Puebla]], defending Mexican forces under [[Ignacio Zaragoza]] defeated the French army under [[Charles de Lorencez|Count de Lorencez]]. The city's name was changed to Puebla de Zaragoza in 1862, by a decree issued by [[Benito Juárez]] and the holiday "5 de Mayo" ([[Cinco de Mayo]]) is a major annual event here.<ref name="fundpuebla"/> The city was [[Siege of Puebla (1863)|attacked again by the French]] in 1863, who succeeded in taking it. French forces left in 1866 and reconstruction began in 1867.<ref name="sucesos"/>

[[File:Sitio puebla.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Image from the [[Battle of Puebla]] in the city center in 1863.]]

During the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, Puebla remained important culturally and economically. It had a thriving textile industry at this time. Immigration from Europe was encouraged and people from Spain, Italy, Germany, France and [[Lebanon]] came to live in the city.

In what became a precursor to the [[Mexican Revolution]], siblings Carmen, Máximo y [[Aquiles Serdán]] were behind one of the first conspiracies against the Porfirio Diaz government. Their plans were discovered and their house, located on 6 Oriente street was surrounded by federal troops. A gun battle ensued, killing both Serdán brothers on 18 November 1910.<ref name="fundpuebla"/> During the Mexican Revolution, the city was taken by forces under General [[Pablo Gonzalez Garza]], then later was under [[Liberation Army of the South|Zapatista]] control.

===Recent events===
[[File:Puebla City in 1869. Lithograph of the new railway station (cropped).jpg|thumb|Puebla City in 1869. Lithograph of the new railway station.]]
From 1931 until the end of the 20th century, growth of the city spurred the absorption of the municipalities of [[Ignacio Mariscal (municipio)|Ignacio Mariscal]], [[San Felipe Hueyotlipan]], [[Resurrección (municipio)|Resurreccion]], [[San Jeronimo Caleras]], [[San Miguel Canoa]] and [[San Francisco Totimehuacán]] into the city.<ref name="encmuc"/> In 1950, by decree of the state congress, the city received the title of Heroica Puebla de Zaragoza. In 1977, the federal government declared the city a Zone of Historical Monuments. In 1987, the [[historic centre of Puebla]] was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref name="sucesos"/>

The City of Puebla submitted its candidacy to hold the headquarters of the [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]], and briefly served as interim secretariat headquarters until negotiations were stopped in 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebalance.com/ftaa-agreement-member-countries-pros-and-cons-3305577|title=The World's Largest Trade Zone That Never Happened|last=Amadeo|first=Kimberly|website=The Balance|language=en|access-date=2019-03-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hornbeck|first=J.

Most of the municipality has been deforested, including the lower portions of the [[Matlalcueitl (volcano)|Malinche]] volcano and all the Sierra de Amozoc, due to logging and seasonal farming.<ref name="encmuc"/>

The Sierra del Tentzon and higher elevations of Malinche volcano still conserve the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests]] ecoregion – with forests of pine, [[Quercus agrifolia|holm oak]] and other tree species.<ref name="encmuc"/> In the pine forests, [[Montezuma Pine]] ''(Pinus montezumae)'' is generally predominant, with [[Hartweg's Pine]] ''(Pinus hartwegii)'' and ''[[Pinus teocote]]'' in dry areas with shallow soils. Pine-fir forests are composed almost entirely of Hartweg's Pine ''(Pinus hartwegii)'' and [[Sacred Fir]] ''(Abies religiosa)''.

Animal life consists mostly of small mammals such as rabbits and skunks, as well as birds such as owls, buzzards and wild waterfowl.<ref name="encmuc"/>

==Geography==
[[File:Mexico Popocatepetl.jpg|right|thumb|Popocatépetl Volcano]]

Puebla is located at the Valley of Puebla also known as the Valley of Cuetlaxcoapan, a large valley surrounded on four sides by the mountains and volcanoes of the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]]. It is located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} east of the [[Popocatépetl]] and [[Iztaccíhuatl]] volcanoes, giving residents views of their snow-topped peaks. Due to the proximity to the Popocatépetl, Puebla is sometimes exposed to the ash and dust that emanate from the volcano during its active periods, the most recent occurring on 19 May 2023.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2023-05-21 |title=Mexico Raises Alert Level on 'Popo' Volcano Near Mexico City |language=en |work=Bloomberg.com |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-21/mexico-raises-alert-level-on-popo-volcano-near-mexico-city |access-date=2023-08-02}}</ref>

[[Matlalcueitl (volcano)|La Malinche]] dormant volcano is located to the north of the city, and the [[Pico de Orizaba]] to the east. Hydrologically, the city is part of the Atoyac river basin; the river runs through northern, eastern and southern portions of the municipality, and connects to the Lake of Valsequillo, where the Manuel Ávila Camacho dam has been built. Other rivers that cross the area are the Alseseca and San Francisco.

===Museums and galleries===

The [[Amparo Museum]] is housed in two colonial-era buildings from the 17th and 18th centuries that were popularly known as El Hospitalito. One was the Hospital of San Juan de Letrán, which was converted into a college for women. The other is a mansion from the 18th century. It was joined to the hospital and then became the "Deposito de Mujeres Casadas" (Refuge of Married Women) This was established in 1606 for women whose husbands were gone for long periods of time. However, the idea was not popular with women and in 1609, it became the asylum for "lost women," those obligated to be secluded for some reason. This facility was moved to another building and the building became part of the women's college founded next door, then a convent. The museum has fourteen exhibition halls with pottery, steles and sculptures from the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]], [[Huasteca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Olmec]] and [[Aztec]] cultures as well as fine furniture and religious objects from the colonial period and examples of contemporary art. These represent the three epochs of Mexican history, pre-Columbian, colonial-era and post-[[Mexican Independence|Independence]].

The Museo de Arte (Museum of Art) originally was constructed to be the Temple of San Pedro, founded in 1541 to be a church and a hospital. Eventually it was established as the Hospital of San Pedro y San Pablo under the direction of the Cathedral of Tlaxcala. It was functioning as a hospital by 1544, but it incurred major expenditures, forcing it to limit service to men only. The arches of the main courtyard were completed in 1640, as well as it fountain and nursing units. In the first half of the 18th century, the hospital ceased to be under the direct control of the cathedral, passing to the monks of the order of San Juan de Dios. In the latter half of the century, it began to house soldiers in order to improve its finances. The hospital underwent major reforms in the early 19th century to improve medical care, and began to receive medical students from the Medical-Surgical Academy of Puebla. In 1867, the facility became the Hospital General del Estado. In 1917, the hospital moved to new facilities in the city. Through most of the 20th century, the building was used for a wide-variety of purposes. In 1998, a project to restore the building for its use as Puebla Museum of Viceregal Art.

The large friary complex houses an active group of Franciscan friars, who in addition to running a large K-12 school on the site, also work in other pastoral, justice, peace, and environmental activities.

The [[Templo de Santo Domingo, Puebla|Church of Santo Domingo]] is located on 5 de Mayo Street. The main portal is of pure classic style finished in gray cantera stone. It consists of three levels with paired Doric-like columns. The façade of the old monastery is highly decorated in Baroque style, in front of which is a large atrium. Inside the ceiling consists of two large vaults and contains gilded altarpieces in Baroque, Salmonic and Churrigueresque styles.<ref name="ahorre" />

The Chapel of the Rosary is located in the Church of Santo Domingo. The chapel was built between 1650 and 1690 and was the first to be dedicated to the [[Our Lady of the Rosary]]. The chapel is filled with symbolism, as it is filled with images and elements which are representative of the Baroque of New Spain. This symbolism is principally meant to aid with the evangelization process. The chapel contains three themes important to the Church, the mysteries of the rosary, the virtues associated with it and the Virgin of the Rosary herself. The cupola is in the shape of the crown of the [[Virgin Mary]]. The chapel is decorated with sculpted plaster that has been gilded done by local artists. There are also six paintings done by José Rodriguez Carnero as well as paintings by the altar depicting the life of the Virgin.<ref name="catholicnet">{{Cite web |url=http://es.catholic.net/turismoreligioso/659/1202/articulo.php?id=32277 |title= Capilla del Rosario (Puebla, México) |first=Monica |last=Delgado Solano |publisher=Catholic.net |language=es |access-date=2009-10-21}}</ref>

===Other notable buildings===
[[File:Centar grada Pueble.jpg|thumb|right|Portal Hidalgo and Municipal Palace, in the [[Historic centre of Puebla|historic centre]]]]

The Casa del Deán is the oldest noble house in the city of Puebla, constructed by Tomás de la Plaza Goes, who was the deacon of the Cathedral of Puebla. It was finished in 1580. The building remained practically intact until 1953, when it was going to be demolished to construct a movie theater. Protests to save the building, due to its murals and façade, succeeded in preserving only a portion of the building. The murals are frescos, which are the only surviving non-religious examples from the 16th century in their original place in Mexico. The gray stone façade is completely smooth to let the main portal, of Renaissance style, stand out. The portal contains and upper and lower portion with a crest.<ref name="casadean">{{Cite web |url=http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=162:casa-del-dean&catid=34:Museos&Itemid=58 |title= Casa del Deán |first= Luis Alberto |last= Martínez Álvarez |publisher=Government of Puebla |language=es |trans-title=Dean House |date=2009-04-24 |access-date=2009-10-21}}</ref>

The [[Teatro Principal de Puebla]] (Main Theater of Puebla) was inaugurated in 1761 by Miguel de Santamaría. In 1902, the theater burned down, and was rebuilt in 1940, and again in 1998. The theater hosts cultural events and art shows featuring regional, national and international artists.<ref name="Teatroprin">{{Cite web |url=http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=251:teatro-principal&catid=34:Museos&Itemid=58 |title= Teatro Principal |first= Luis Alberto |last= Martínez Álvarez |publisher=Government of Puebla |language=es |trans-title=Main Theater |date=2009-04-24 |access-date=2009-10-21}}</ref>

The Municipal Palace is located on Maximino Avila Camacho. The façade is made of gray cantera stone in Renaissance style, using [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns and [[pediment]]s, differing from the other buildings that border the main plaza. The portal has two levels topped by a central garret, in which there is a clock and towers on each side.<ref name="ahorre"/>

The Fountain of the [[China Poblana]] is located on Blvd Heroes de 5 de May. It is a monumental work done in cantera stone and Talavera tile, with a base of about thirty meters in diameter. In the center is a column that supports two large bowls and a sculpture of the China Pobalana which is over three meters high.<ref name="ahorre"/> This fountain was inaugurated in September 1971. The monument was sculpted by Jesús Corro Ferrer, who portaraited the China Poblana using the image of his own wife - María del Consuelo López y Martínez.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pueblacity.com/fountain-of-the-china-poblana/|title=Fountain of the China Poblana|work=Puebla City [pueblacity.com]}}</ref>

===Cuisine===
[[File:Mole in Puebla.JPG|thumb|left|[[Mole poblano]]]]

The best-known [[Mole (sauce)|mole]] is named after the city of Puebla, [[mole poblano]]. The origin of this sauce is disputed and there are two versions of the legend that are most often cited. The first states that 16th century nuns from the Convent of Santa Rosa were worried because they had just found out that the archbishop was going to visit them and they had nothing to prepare for him except for an old turkey in the yard. Supposedly due to divine inspiration, they began to mix together many of the spices and flavorings they had on hand in the kitchen, including different types of chili peppers, other spices, day-old bread, chocolate and approximately twenty other ingredients. They let the sauce simmer for hours and poured it over the turkey meat. Fortunately, the archbishop was very pleased with the meal and the nuns were able to save face.<ref name="national">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mexonline.com/molepoblano.htm |title= Mole Poblano: Mexico's National Food Dish |publisher=Mexonline |access-date=2009-10-21}}</ref>

The other story states that the sauce is of pre-Hispanic times and this was served to [[Hernán Cortés]] and the other conquistadors by [[Moctezuma II]].<ref name="national"/> The Aztecs did have a preparation called "chilmulli", which in [[Nahuatl]] means "chili pepper sauce".<ref name="92percent">{{cite news |first=Josefina |last=Quintero M. |title=92% de la población se dedica a la preparación y venta del mole |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2007/09/23/index.php?section=capital&article=035n1cap |publisher=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=2007-09-23 |access-date=2009-05-30 |language=es}}</ref> However, there is no evidence that chocolate was ever used to flavor prepared foods or used in chilmulli.<ref name="national"/> What has happened is that the sauce gained ingredients as it was reinterpreted over the colonial period.<ref name="92percent"/>
Many food writers and gourmets nowadays consider one particular dish, the famous turkey in mole poblano, which contains chocolate, to represent the pinnacle of the Mexican cooking tradition.<ref name="national"/>
[[File:Chile en nogada.jpg|thumb|Chiles en nogada]]
Another famous dish, [[chiles en nogada]], was also supposedly invented here. The story begins with three sisters from Puebla who met officers from [[Agustin de Iturbide]]'s [[Army of the Three Guarantees]] in Mexico City and fell in love with them. Attempts were made to engage the couples but one problem was that none of the sisters knew how to cook. Upon returning to Puebla, their mother sent them to the Convent of Santa Monica to learn. The women decided they wanted to make an original dish to impress Iturbide and his officers when they were due to visit Puebla. The dish, chiles en nogada, represents the colors of the [[Flag of Mexico|Mexican flag]], green (parsley), white (the walnut sauce) and red ([[pomegranate]] seeds). The dish was served for the first time at a banquet for Iturbide with great success.<ref name="chilesnogada">{{Cite web |url=http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=171:chiles-en-nogada&catid=37:Leyendas&Itemid=61 |title= Chiles en Nogada |first= Luis Alberto |last= Martínez Álvarez |publisher=Government of Puebla |language=es |trans-title=Chiles en Nogada |date=2009-04-24 |access-date=2009-10-21}}</ref>

[[File:CemitaSandwich2.JPG|thumb|left|Cemita with milanesa]]

Another signature dish in Puebla is the "[[cemita]]", which is a type of well-stuffed sandwich on a bun.<ref name="kaufman"/> The cemita is considered to be "the sister of the Mexican [[torta]], the first cousin of the [[pambazo]], the distant cousin of the [[paste (pasty)|paste]] and the sandwich and the precursor to the giant tortas" that are now sold in most parts of Mexico today. This large, meaty sandwich is named after the bread on which it is served, a cemita. This bread is based on a bread introduced by the French during the period of the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French Intervention in Mexico]] (1863–1867), but since then has evolved to suit Mexican tastes, especially in Puebla state. In the early 20th century, the bread began to be served sliced with a filling of leftovers, generally potatoes, beans, [[nopal]], beef, chicken or pork. The Victoria Market in Puebla became famous for a version with beef hoof, onions and chili peppers with a vinaigrette sauce. Other markets and food stands soon created their own versions of the cemita with just about any kind of filling combination possible. During the same time period, it became traditional to sprinkle sesame seeds onto the cemita bread, often with designs of flowers, stars, animals and other things. While the dish started out as a lower-class meal, it is now enjoyed by people of all social classes in the city as a form of fast-food.<ref name="cemitas">{{Cite web |url=http://www.pue.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=173 |title= Cemitas Poblanas |first=Luis Alberto |last=Martinez Alvarez |publisher=Government of Puebla |language=es |trans-title=Puebla Cemitas |date=2009-04-24 |access-date=2009-10-21}}</ref>

===Talavera pottery===
{{Main|Talavera pottery}}
[[File:FacadeUriartePuebla.JPG|thumb|[[Uriarte Talavera]] workshop facade]]
[[File:TalaveraPlateMAPDF.JPG|thumb|Talavera plate by Marcela Lobo]]
Soon after its foundation, Puebla was well known for its fine ceramics, especially for the style that would be called [[Talavera (pottery)|Talavera]]. This has been due to the abundance of quality clay in the region, drawing some of the best artisans. Between 1550 and 1570, Spanish potters from [[Talavera de la Reina]] in Spain came to Puebla to teach the locals European techniques of using the potter's wheel and tin-glazing. These new methods were mixed with native designs to give rise to what became known as Poblano Talavera. The glazing technique was first used for the tiles that still decorate many of the buildings in this city. Later, it was used to make pots, plates, jars, religious figures and other items. By the mid-17th century, the industry here had become well-established. Guilds were formed and ordinances passed to ensure quality. Blue was used only on the most expensive pieces due to the cost of the mineral used to produce it. The period between 1650 and 1750 was known as the Golden Age.<ref name="pomade">{{Cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1061-talavera-mexico-s-earthly-legacy-from-the-city-of-angels |title= Talavera – Mexico's earthly legacy from the City Of Angels |first=Rita |last=Pomade |publisher=Mexconnect |date=2006-01-01 |access-date=2009-10-21}}</ref>

In 1813, the constitution eradicated the potter's guild and revoked the ordinances established in 1653 to standardize production. Now anybody could use this ceramic method in any style they wanted, and the lack of regulations led to a decline in technique and artistic quality. The Talavera market crashed. Out of the 46 workshops in production since the 18th century, only seven remained. When Enrique Luis Ventosa, a 29-year-old Catalan, arrived in Puebla in 1897, there were just six workshops left. Ventosa was fascinated by the history and fine craft work that had distinguished Puebla from the rest of Mexico. He became the leading force behind a renaissance in Talavera ware.<ref name="pomade"/>

Another impetus to the rebirth of Puebla tile was that collectors found out about it. In 1904 an American named Emily Johnston de Forest traveled to Mexico with her husband and discovered Talavera. She established contact with scholars, collectors, and dealers who assisted her in building her collection. Eventually her collection was given to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City. Other museums, like the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], built their own collections. The [[Franz Mayer Museum]] in Mexico City has the largest collection of 726 pieces.<ref name="pomade"/>

===Story of the China Poblana===
{{Main|Catarina de San Juan}}
[[File:Catarina de San Juan.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Catarina de San Juan, in a 17th-century woodcut]]
According to colonial-era published sources, a young [[Demographics of India|Indian]] woman named Mirra was kidnapped by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] pirates and taken to Cochin (modern-day Kochi), in the south of India. There, she escaped her kidnappers and took refuge in a [[Jesuit]] mission, where she was [[baptism|baptized]] with the name ''Catarina de San Juan''. Mirra was again kidnapped by the same pirates that had taken her from her birth parents, and in [[Manila]] they delivered her to the merchant who later took her to New Spain. Once in [[Acapulco]], she was sold to a Puebla merchant by the name of Miguel de Sosa. Through her life, Catarina or Mirra continued to dress in a [[sari]]. It is possible that this gave rise to the "china dress" that became popular in Mexico in the 17th century. A few years after her arrival in Mexico, Miguel de Sosa died, providing in his [[will (law)|will]] for the [[manumission]] of his slave. She was taken in by a convent, where it is said she began to have visions of the Virgin Mary and [[Baby Jesus]]. The "China Poblana" died on 5 January 1688 at the age of 82. In Puebla, she was venerated as a saint until 1691, when the [[Mexican Inquisition]] prohibited open devotion to her. Today, the Templo de la Compañía, in Puebla, is known as ''La Tumba de la China Poblana'' because in its sacristy lie the remains of Catarina de San Juan.<ref name="maza">{{cite book |last1=De la Maza |first1=Francisco |title=Catarina de San Juan.

=== Tunnel system ===
{{Main|Puebla tunnels}}
There have long been rumours of a system of tunnels under the city. Long considered to be an [[urban legend]], they were rediscovered in 2015. They are believed to be up to 500 years old and are thought to extend for more than 10&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/mexico/11846596/Ancient-tunnels-discovered-underneath-Mexican-city-of-Puebla.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906193848/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/mexico/11846596/Ancient-tunnels-discovered-underneath-Mexican-city-of-Puebla.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 September 2015|title=Ancient tunnels discovered underneath Mexican city of Puebla|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=5 September 2015}}</ref>

Puebla has one professional football team, [[Puebla F.C.]] The biggest football stadium in the city, [[Cuauhtémoc Stadium]], with a capacity of 51,720, was built in 1968 as a second football field for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympic Games]]. Matches for the [[Football World Cup 1970|1970]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup]]s were also played in Cuauhtémoc Stadium. In 2015 it was intervened to make it up to new Fifa standards which commodity, modernism and outside visual image have changed for the better. With a capacity of 51,720 it is the 4th biggest stadium in México just behind Jalisco Stadium. At 45.9 meters tall it is also the highest stadium from parking level to the highest most part of the roof beating the second tallest Aztec stadium by 4 meters.

Puebla has a professional baseball team, the [[Pericos de Puebla]].

Puebla, through the conurbated area of [[Cholula, Puebla|Cholula]], has one college [[American football]] team, the "Aztecas" of the [[Universidad de las Américas (Mexico)|Universidad de las Américas]]. The Aztecas have won the championship three times since the creation of the [[ONEFA|Mexican College Football Organization]] (ONEFA) in 1978 (1995, 1996, and 1997). The team has been runners-up in the league five times, most recently in 2006 and 2007, losing the championship game all five times to the ITESM Campus Monterrey Borregos Salvajes.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} The Aztecas' home stadium is the ''Templo del Dolor'' (Temple of Pain).

==Economy==
Some agriculture still takes place in the municipality but environmental degradation and the growth of the city is making this a smaller sector of the economy. Crops raised include corn, beans, wheat, oats, avocados, pears, apples, peaches, [[choke cherries]], [[Crataegus mexicana|Mexican hawthorns]], nuts and [[white sapote]]s. Most agriculture takes place on small plots on the edges of the municipality. Similarly livestock such as cattle, pigs, sheep and horses are raised.<ref name="encmuc"/>

Industry accounts for about eighty percent of the economy and is mostly based in the outskirts of the city as well as in some surrounding municipalities. Main products include basic metals, chemicals, electrical items and textiles. The main employers are Hylsa and the Volkswagen automotive plant. A growing sector is food processing. Many industries are consolidated into parks such as the 5 de Mayo Industrial Park, the Resurrección Industrial Zone and the Puebla 2000 Industrial Park. Shopping centers include the [[Angelópolis Lifestyle Center]] and [[Parque Puebla]].

==Transportation==
Puebla is served by [[Puebla International Airport]], which is part of the metropolitan airport group for the Mexican capital and an alternate airport for [[Mexico City]]. It provides domestic services and flights to the United States. The airport is also used as a place to manufacture goods and export and import due to prime location.

In January 2013 the first line of the rapid transit bus system named RUTA was opened to the public from Chachapa to Tlaxcalancingo, in April 2014 the second line was inaugurated going from North 11th street at the height of Diagonal Defensores de la República to Calle Limones, and in 2019 the third line was added to the system, transporting passengers from Valsequillo to CAPU, the main hub for transport outside of the city. The [[Puebla-Cholula Tourist Train]] was inaugurated in January 2017 connecting Puebla with Cholula in the western end of the city.<ref>{{cite news|title=Puebla tram-train inaugurated|url=https://www.railwaygazette.com/projects-and-planning/puebla-tram-train-inaugurated/43878.article |access-date=11 December 2017|work=Metro Report International |publisher=DVV Media International |date=25 January 2017 |url-access=registration |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200809143211/https://www.railwaygazette.com/projects-and-planning/puebla-tram-train-inaugurated/43878.article |archive-date=9 August 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> Operation of the tram-train ended on 31 December 2021.<ref>{{cite web |title=Puebla tram-train ceases operation |url=https://www.railwaygazette.com/light-rail-and-tram/puebla-tram-train-ceases-operation/60677.article |work=Metro Report International |publisher=DVV Media International |date=11 January 2022 |access-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=registration}}</ref>
