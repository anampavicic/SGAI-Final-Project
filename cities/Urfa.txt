'''Urfa''', officially called '''Şanlıurfa''' ({{IPA|tr|ʃanˈɫɯuɾfa}}), is a city in southeastern [[Turkey]] and the capital of [[Şanlıurfa Province]]. The city was known as '''[[Edessa]]''' from [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] times and into Christian times. Urfa is situated on a plain about 80&nbsp;km east of the [[Euphrates]]. Its climate features extremely hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.

About {{cvt|12|km|0}} northeast of the city is the famous [[Neolithic]] site of [[Göbekli Tepe]], the world's oldest known temple, which was founded in the 10th millennium BC.<ref name="The World's First Temple"/> The area was part of a network of the first human settlements where the [[Neolithic Revolution|agricultural revolution]] took place. Because of its association with [[Jewish history|Jewish]], [[History of Christianity|Christian]], and [[History of Islam|Islamic history]], and a legend according to which it was the hometown of [[Abraham]], Urfa is nicknamed the "City of Prophets."<ref name="rel"/>

Religion is important in Urfa. The city "has become a center of fundamentalist Islamic beliefs"<ref name="Miller 1995">{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Julie A. |editor1-last=Ring |editor1-first=Trudy |title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Vol. 3: Southern Europe |date=1995 |publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn |location=Chicago and London |isbn=1-884964-02-8 |pages=617–20 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=74JI2UlcU8AC&dq=gumruk+hani+sanliurfa&pg=PA620 |access-date=3 October 2022 |chapter=Şanlıurfa}}</ref>{{rp|620}} and "is considered one of the most devoutly religious cities in Turkey".<ref name="JTA 2003">{{cite web |title=The secret Jews of remote Turkey |url=https://www.jta.org/2003/03/04/lifestyle/the-secret-jews-of-remote-turkey |website=Jewish Telegraph Agency |date=4 March 2003 |access-date=4 October 2022}}</ref>

The city is located 30 miles from the [[Atatürk Dam]], at the heart of the [[Southeast Anatolia Project]], which draws thousands of job-seeking rural villagers to the city every year.<ref name="JTA 2003"/>

==Name==
The oldest name for the city is the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] ''Orhay'', which is derived from either the Semitic root ''-r-w-ʿ'', meaning "to bring water", or the Greek name "Orrha", meaning "beautiful flowing water".<ref name="Unfinished">{{cite book |last1=Purcell |first1=Bridget |editor1-last=Biehl |editor1-first=Joao |editor2-last=Locke |editor2-first=Peter |title=Unfinished: The Anthropology of Becoming |date=2017 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=United States |isbn=9780822372455 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pfk9DwAAQBAJ&dq=urfa+economy&pg=PT138 |access-date=4 October 2022 |chapter=Rebellious Matter}}</ref>{{rp|136}}

[[James Silk Buckingham]] claimed that in earlier times, the city was known as ''Ruha'', and with the Arabic article, it became ''Ar-Ruha'', evolving into ''Urha'', and eventually ''Urfa''. [[Carsten Niebuhr]] observed that Turks called the city ''El-Rohha'' in the 18th century, although Buckingham who later visited Urfa, disagreed and noted that all Turks, and most Arabs and Kurds in the surrounding countryside called it Urfa, while a small portion of the Christians called it as the former.<ref name = "Buckingham"/> The city is called {{lang|ku|Riha}} in [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Avcıkıran |first=Adem |url= |title=Kürtçe Anamnez Anamneza bi Kurmancî |date=2009 |page=57 |language=tr, ku |accessdate=}}</ref> The city is known as {{lang|hy|Ուռհա}}, ''Urha'', in [[Armenian language|Armenian]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Roderick Beaton |author2=David Ricks |title=Digenes Akrites: new approaches to Byzantine heroic poetry |date=1993 |publisher=Variorum |location=Brookfield, Vt. |isbn=0-86078-395-2 |page=87}}</ref>

In 1984, the Turkish National Assembly granted Urfa the title "Şanlı", meaning "glorious", in honor of its citizens' resistance against British and French troops at the end of the [[First World War]], hence the present name "Şanlıurfa".<ref name="Saraç 2018">{{cite book |last1=Saraç |first1=Mehmet Adil |title=Tanıklarıyla Urfalı Urfalıca |date=2018 |publisher=Şanlıurfa Metropolitan Municipality |location=Istanbul |isbn=978-975-8165-40-7 |url=https://www.sanliurfa.bel.tr/files/1/bsb_sonra/urfaca_urfalica.pdf |access-date=28 December 2022}}</ref>{{rp|17}}

===Prehistory===
[[File:Urfa_Adamı_(2).jpg|thumb|[[Urfa Man]], [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic]], {{c.|9000 BC}}. [[Şanlıurfa Museum]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Renfrew |first1=Colin |last2=Boyd |first2=Michael J. |last3=Morley |first3=Iain |title=Death Rituals and Social Order in the Ancient World: Death Shall Have No Dominion |year=2016 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781107082731 |pages=74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CdnECgAAQBAJ&pg=PA73 }}</ref>]]
Urfa shares the [[Balikh River]] Valley region with two other significant [[Neolithic]] sites at [[Nevalı Çori]] and [[Göbekli Tepe]]. Settlements in the area originated around 9000 BC as a [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A|PPNA]] Neolithic sites located near Abraham's Pool (Site Name: [[Balıklıgöl]]).

There is no written evidence for earlier settlement at the site, but Urfa's favorable commercial and geographical placement suggests that there was a smaller settlement present prior to 303 BC.<ref name=":0" /> Perhaps Orhai's absence from earlier written sources is due to the settlement having been small and unfortified prior to the Seleucid period.<ref>{{cite book |last=Segal |first=J. B. |title=Edessa:'The Blessed City' |publisher=Gorgias Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-9713097-1-X |edition=2 |location=Piscataway, New Jersey, United States |pages=5 |chapter=I. The Beginnings |quote=It is certainly surprising that no obvious reference to Orhay has been found so far in the early historical texts dealing with the region, and that, unlike Harran, its name does not occur in cuneiform itineraries. This may be accidental, or Orhay may be alluded to under a different name which has not been identified. Perhaps it was not fortified, and therefore at this time a place of no great military significance. With the Seleucid period, however, we are on firm historical ground. Seleucus I founded—or rather re-founded—a number of cities in the region. Among them, probably in 303 or 302 BC, was Orhay. |author-link=Judah Segal |orig-year=1970}}</ref>

In prehistoric times, the Urfa Region was attractive for human habitation because of its dense grazing areas and the presence of wild animals on migration routes. As a result, the area became densely populated, particularly in the Neolithic period.<ref name="Çelik 2008">{{cite book |last1=Çelik |first1=Bahattin |title=Arkeoloji'de Urfa |date=2008 |publisher=Fsf Printing House |location=Istanbul |isbn=978-975-585-992-7 |url=https://www.sanliurfa.bel.tr/files/1/bsb_sonra/il_kultur_mudurlugu/1_arkeolojide_urfa.pdf |access-date=8 November 2022}}</ref>{{rp|XXIII}}

In Urfa itself, there was a prehistoric settlement at Yeni Mahalle Höyüğü (aka Balıklıgöl Höyüğü), located immediately north of Balıklıgöl in the heart of the old town.<ref name="Çelik 2014">{{cite book |last1=Çelik |first1=Bahattin |editor1-last=Engin |editor1-first=Atilla |editor2-last=Helwing |editor2-first=Barbara |editor3-last=Uysal |editor3-first=Bora |title=Armizzi: Engin Özgen Armağan |date=2014 |publisher=Asitan Kitap |pages=101–7 |url=https://www.academia.edu/20828712 |access-date=7 November 2022 |chapter=Şanlıurfa – Yeni Mahalle Höyüğü in the Light of Novel C14 Analysis}}</ref><ref name="Çelik 2008"/>{{rp|15}} Now buried under single-story houses, the site was accidentally discovered during road construction in the 1990s and then excavated in 1997 by the Şanlıurfa Museum Directorate. The findings included [[flint]] tools, arrowheads dated to the early Pre-Pottery Neolithic B phase, and two round buildings with [[terrazzo]] floors.<ref name="Çelik 2014"/> Animal bones found at the site indicate hunting activity, and charred seed samples indicate that the villagers cultivated wheat and barley. The village at Yeni Mahalle is radiocarbon dated to roughly 9400–8600 BCE.<ref name="Çelik 2008"/>{{rp|15}}

====Bronze Age====
During the Uruk period expansion about 3200 BC. The villages Urfa and Harran began to transform into cities. By the Early Bronze Age (2900-2600 BCE) Urfa had grown into a walled city of 200ha. This city is located at the archeological site Kazane Tepe adjacent to modern Urfa.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Creekmore |first1=Andrew |title=Landscape and Settlement in the Harran Plain |journal=American Journal of Archaeology |date=2018 |volume=122 |issue=2 |doi=10.3764/aja.122.2.0177 |jstor=10.3764/aja.122.2.0177 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3764/aja.122.2.0177 |access-date=1 July 2024}}</ref> There is a tentative, yet unproven identification of ancient Urfa (Kazane Tepe) with the city of Urshu.

A much later artifact is a black stone pedestal with a double bull relief, found at a hill called Külaflı Tepe in the former village of Cavşak in the 1950s when the village was being evacuated to build a base for the Urfa Brigade. The pedestal contains an inscription with an invocation to the god [[Tarhunza]] and mentions a city whose name is only partly visible, but which Bahattin Çelik restores as "Umalia", in the country of [[Bit Adini]].<ref name="Çelik 2008"/>{{rp|16–7}}

===City of Edessa===
{{main|Edessa}}
Urfa was founded as a city under the name Edessa by the Seleucid king [[Seleucus I Nicator]] in 302 or 303 BC.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Schnusenberg |first=Christine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JhE2GC-rI04 |title=The Mythological Traditions of Liturgical Drama: The Eucharist as Theater |publisher=Paulist Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-8091-0544-1 |location=New York |pages=116}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Murray |first=Alan V. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-opAQAAMAAJ |title=The Crusades: An Encyclopedia |date=2006 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-57607-862-4 |pages=378 |language=en}}</ref> Seleucus named the city Edessa after the [[Edessa, Greece|ancient capital of Macedonia]].<ref name="Patten 2022 p. 79">{{cite book |last=Patten |first=N. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8RhtEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA79 |title=The Rose of Balarm: A Tale of 12th-Century Sicily |publisher=Strategic Book Publishing |year=2022 |isbn=978-1-68235-601-2 |page=79 |access-date=2023-09-22}}</ref>

Ancient sources describe Seleucid Edessa as following the typical plan for Hellenistic military colonies: its streets were laid out in a grid pattern, with four main streets that intersected each other. There were four city gates, and the main citadel was outside the walls. Macedonian soldiers were settled in the new city,<ref name="Ball 2000">{{cite book |last1=Ball |first1=Warwick |title=Rome in the East: The Transformation of an Empire |date=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London and New York |isbn=0-415-11376-8 |pages=87–96 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=73-JAgAAQBAJ |access-date=4 November 2022 |chapter=Edessa and the Coming of Christendom}}</ref>{{rp|89}} but they never formed a majority of its population.<ref name="Lieu 1997">{{Cite book|last=Lieu|first=Samuel|chapter=Edessa|title=Encyclopaedia Iranica|year=1997|volume=8|issue=2|pages=174–175|chapter-url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/edessa}}</ref> The city's culture remained predominantly Semitic (specifically Aramaic), and any [[Hellenization]] was minimal.<ref name="Ball 2000"/>{{rp|89, 91–2}}

Edessa was an important commercial center in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|198}} Previously, the main east-west trade route across Upper Mesopotamia had gone through [[Harran]], but the founding of Edessa caused that route to shift northwards.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|195}}

In 132 BC, following the decline of the Seleucids, Edessa became the capital of the kingdom of [[Osrhoene]], which was ruled by the [[Abgarid dynasty|Abgarids]], an Arabized tribal dynasty with origins in [[Nisibis]].<ref name="Ball 2000"/>{{rp|89–90}} The Abgarids were generally allied with the [[Parthian Empire]] and were under Parthian cultural influence as well.<ref name="Lieu 1997"/>

[[File:Roman Orpheus Taming Wild Animals.jpg|thumb|left|Mosaic of [[Orpheus]] from Roman Edessa, {{circa}} 200 AD]]
In the early second century AD, [[Abgar VII]] supported the Roman emperor [[Trajan]]'s campaign in Mesopotamia and received him "sumptously" at his court, but later rebelled. In retaliation, the Romans captured and destroyed Edessa, and Abgar VII was killed. The Romans installed a Parthian prince, [[Parthamaspates]], on the Edessan throne as a puppet ruler in 117, but the Abgarids were later restored to power. Similarly, the Parthians captured Edessa in 163 and installed Wa'el bar Sharu as a puppet king. The deposed Ma'nu VIII went to the Romans, who took Edessa in 165 and restored Ma'nu to power. In 166, Osrhoene became a Roman client kingdom.<ref name="Ball 2000"/>{{rp|90}}

Ma'nu VIII died in 177 and was succeeded by [[Abgar VIII]], also called Abgar the Great. Abgar was stripped of most of his domains except for Edessa, and Osrhoene became a Roman province, when his ally [[Pescennius Niger]] lost the civil war to [[Septimius Severus]].<ref name="Ball 2000"/>{{rp|90}} Abgar devoted his remaining time to fostering arts and learning. In 201, much of Edessa was destroyed by a major flood. According to the ''Chronicle of Edessa'', over 2,000 people died. Abgar granted a remission of taxes for people affected by the flood and immediately began a large-scale reconstruction project of the city after the old Seleucid plan. Abgar repaired the old royal palace by the river, which had been damaged by the flood, but he also built a new palace on higher ground.<ref name="Ball 2000"/>{{rp|91}}

[[File:Balıklıgöl_Urfa2.jpg|thumb|The sacred carp of Balıklıgöl: a tradition which goes back to ancient times]]
Ancient Edessa was an eclectic melting pot of different religious groups.<ref name="Ball 2000"/>{{rp|92}} Unlike Harran, where the cult of the moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]] predominated, the people of Edessa worshipped a whole pantheon of gods that can generally be identified with planets.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|195}} In addition to polytheists, Edessa also had a prominent Jewish community.<ref name="Ball 2000"/>{{rp|93}} Many of Edessa's Jews were merchants, involved in long-distance trade between the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean.<ref name="Ball 2000"/>{{rp|94}} By the end of the 2nd century, a small Christian community had appeared in Edessa.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|195}} Christianity also resonated with several religious themes already present in Edessa – besides the concept of a virgin mother and child, there was also the concept of a divine trinity and a hope for life after death.<ref name="Ball 2000"/>{{rp|95}} Edessa's Jewish community was probably partly responsible for the rapid spread of Christianity in the city.<ref name="Ball 2000"/>{{rp|94–5}} Abgar the Great reportedly converted to Christianity around the turn of the 3rd century, which if true would make Edessa the first Christian polity in the world.<ref name="Ball 2000"/>{{rp|95}}

More religions joined the mix during the 3rd century.<ref name="Ball 2000"/>{{rp|95}} One was the Bardaisanites, founded by the important philosopher [[Bardaisan]] who Abgar the Great was a patron of.<ref name="Ball 2000"/>{{rp|94}} Another was the [[Elkesaites]], a [[syncretism|syncretic]] religion that combined elements of Christianity, Judaism, and paganism.<ref name="Ball 2000"/>{{rp|96}} There was already an active Manichaean community in Edessa during Mani's lifetime: there is a reference in the [[Cologne Mani Codex]] to a letter he wrote to his followers in Edessa.<ref name="Lieu 1997"/> Manichaeism's spread to Edessa was attributed to two of Mani's disciples named Addai and Thomas. Edessa's Manichaean community remained prominent until the 5th century.<ref name="Ball 2000"/>{{rp|95}}

====Roman rule====
Abgar the Great died in 212 and was succeeded by [[Abgar IX]], also called Severus as a sign of Roman influence. Abgar IX only reigned for a year – in 213, he was summoned to Rome by the emperor [[Caracalla]], who then had him murdered. In 214, Caracalla made Edessa a Roman colony, officially ending any autonomy the city had. A son of Abgar IX, known as Ma'nu IX, appears to have been nominally a king until 240; he received an embassy from India in 218, during the reign of [[Elagabalus]], but he did nothing else of note. The monarchy seems to have been restored to power at some point – and Abgar IX was apparently king until 248, when the emperor [[Philip the Arab]] had him banished after Edessa rebelled.<ref name="Ball 2000"/>{{rp|91}}

In 260, the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] emperor [[Shapur I]] defeated the Romans in the [[Battle of Edessa]] and captured the emperor.<ref name="Lieu 1997"/> However, either Shapur never actually captured the city or he only held it for a very short time – it is not listed among the cities he captured in his inscription on the [[Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]], and in the aftermath of the battle he had to bribe Edessa's garrison to let his army pass unmolested.<ref name="Lieu 1997"/>

As a result of [[Diocletian]]'s reorganization of the empire in 293, a state-run factory was built at Edessa to make weapons and equipment for the soldiers stationed along the border.<ref name="Lieu 1997"/> In 298, after [[Galerius Maximianus]]'s victory over the Sasanians, Edessa was made capital of the new province of Osrhoene.<ref name="Lieu 1997"/> It served as a military base in the Mesopotamian ''[[limes (Roman Empire)|limes]]'', although it was secondary to Nisibis in that system.<ref name="Lieu 1997"/>

====Late antiquity====
In the 4th through 6th centuries AD, Edessa went through arguably its period of greatest prosperity. It was again an important commercial center, and merchants grew rich on trade in luxury goods from the east, particularly silk. As with later periods, the city had a council of notable citizens who were at least partly in charge of local government and administration. In the 5th century there were three different theological schools in Edessa: the School of the Syrians (affiliated with the patriarchate of Antioch), the School of the Armenians, and the famous School of the Persians (whose teachers were not actually Persians but rather members of the [[Church of the East]]). The School of the Persians was closed down in 489 and its staff relocated to Nisibis. There were many churches in the city and monasteries in the area. Just outside the walls were several infirmaries and hospitals.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|198}}

When the Roman emperor [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]] surrendered Nisibis to the Sasanians in 363, an influx of refugees came to Edessa, including many Christians.<ref name="Lieu 1997"/> One of these refugees was the writer and theologian [[Ephrem the Syrian]], who was a co-founder of the School of the Persians in Edessa.<ref name="Lieu 1997"/> According to T.A. Sinclair, as Christianity gained more of a presence in Edessa, the pagan planet-worshippers increasingly emigrated to Harran.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|198}}

By the early 6th century, a small lake had formed on the west side of the city. In 525, a flood destroyed part of the western city wall and damaged some of the city. Afterwards, a deep ditch was dug on the north and east sides of the city to act as a [[flood channel]]. In normal weather, a low dam kept the Daisan river in its original course, but if the dam overflowed, then the floodwaters would flow through the artificial channel instead of into the city. At some point later on, the flood channel became the normal course of the river.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|3}}

Edessa successfully held out during a siege in 544.<ref name="Lieu 1997"/> In 609, however, the Sasanian emperor [[Khosrow II]] captured Edessa during his campaign in Mesopotamia.<ref name="Lieu 1997"/> Many of the city's Monophysites were deported to Iran.<ref name="Lieu 1997"/> In 628, the Byzantine emperor [[Heraclius]] captured Edessa.<ref name="Lieu 1997"/>

Urfa surrendered to the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]] general [[Iyad ibn Ghanm]] in 639 without resistance, supposedly when Iyad "stood at its gate riding a brown horse" according to [[al-Baladhuri]].<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|46}} Several versions of the terms of surrender appear in historical sources, mentioning the citizens would be responsible for "repairing 'bridges and roads'".<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|46}} The pact also guaranteed that the city's Christians would keep ownership of the cathedral.<ref name="Guidetti 2013"/>{{rp|244}} Sometime shortly after Urfa submitted to Muslim rule, a mosque was built in the city, although its location is unknown.<ref name="Guidetti 2013"/>{{rp|245}}

In the early centuries of Arab rule, and particularly under the Umayyads, Urfa was still a major Christian city.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|201}} It formed part of the province of [[Diyar Mudar]].<ref name="Brill EoI">{{cite book |last1=Honigmann |first1=E. |last2=Bosworth |first2=C.E. |last3=Faroqhi |first3=Suraiya |editor1-last=Bosworth |editor1-first=C.E. |editor2-last=Van Donzel|editor2-first=E. |editor3-last=Heinrichs|editor3-first=W.P. |editor4-last=Lecomte |editor4-first=G. |title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Volume VIII (NED-SAM) |date=1995 |publisher=E.J.

When the caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] came to power in 813, he dispatched his general [[Tahir ibn Husayn]] to Urfa to put down Nasr ibn Shabath's rebellion. The rebels besieged Tahir's forces in Urfa, but the local civilians (one of them was the future Syriac church leader [[Dionysius I Telmaharoyo]]) supported the soldiers and the siege was unsuccessful.

In the spring of 943, the Byzantine army campaigned in upper Mesopotamia, capturing several cities and either threatening Urfa or, according to [[Symeon Magister]], besieging it outright.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|19}} The Byzantines demanded that the ''[[mandylion]]'' (called ''al-mandīl'' in Arabic), by now a famous Christian relic, be handed over to the emperor. In return, the city would be spared and 200 Muslim prisoners would be released.

===11th century===
The [[Numayrid dynasty|Numayrid]] emir [[Waththab ibn Sabiq]] declared independence in 990 and annexed Edessa early in his reign. Waththab appointed his cousin 'Utayr as governor of the city.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|204}} 'Utayr installed someone named Ahmad ibn Muhammad as his ''[[na'ib]]'' (deputy) here, but then later had him assassinated.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|590}} This evidently made 'Utayr unpopular with the locals, since Ahmad had treated them well.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|204}} In 1025/6 (416 AH), the city's inhabitants rebelled and appealed to [[Marwanids (Diyar Bakr)#Nasr al-Dawla Ahmad ibn Marwan|Nasr ad-Dawla]], the Marwanid emir of Diyar Bakr.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|590}}<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|204}} At first, Nasr ad-Dawla appointed someone named Zangi to be his deputy in Edessa, but Zangi died in 1027. Meanwhile, 'Utayr had been assassinated.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|590}} This time, Nasr ad-Dawla ended up appointing two deputies to jointly control Edessa: he chose 'Utayr's son, known only by the ''[[nasab]]'' "Ibn 'Utayr", to be in charge of the main citadel, while he appointed a different Numayrid named Shibl ad-Dawla to be in charge of the smaller citadel – i.e. the converted east gate, now the Bey Kapısı.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|204}}

[[Image:The seizure of Edessa in Syria by the Byzantine army and the Arabic counterattack from the Chronicle of John Skylitzes.jpg|thumb|Miniature from the ''History'' of John Skylitzes showing George Maniakes defending Edessa from Nasr ad-Dawla's counterattack.]]
In October 1031, the Byzantine general [[George Maniakes]] conquered Edessa. This would ultimately be the last significant territorial acquisition by the Byzantine Empire in Mesopotamia.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|20}} The accounts of this event differ heavily.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|590}} According to one version, Ibn 'Utayr had entered into negotiations with Maniakes, intending to sell him the citadel. His desire to sell was apparently motivated by a threat from Shibl ad-Dawla.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|204}} In [[John Skylitzes]]'s version, however, Maniakes had bribed Salman, a deputy of Nasr ad-Dawla's, into surrendering the city to him in the middle of the night.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|20}} If this was the case, then Salman either had some authority over Ibn 'Utayr or had otherwise deposed him.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|204}}

Whoever Maniakes had been negotiating with, Byzantine forces gained control of some of the fortifications but not the rest of the city.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|204}} Exactly which parts Maniakes had taken control of are unclear – Skylitzes described Maniakes had taken possession of "three heavily fortified towers", but his description of Edessa's geography is completely inaccurate and he clearly had never been to the city himself. [[Matthew of Edessa]]'s account, which is more reliable, mentions "three citadels"; according to Tara Andrews, the upper citadel must have been one of them.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|20}} According to T.A. Sinclair, Maniakes had already gained control of the upper citadel.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|204}} That winter, Nasr ad-Dawla came with an army in an attempt to drive out the Byzantines.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|590}} Nasr ad-Dawla tried to besiege the Byzantine positions but was unsuccessful and decided to loot the city and tear down buildings, then burn the city to the ground while retreating with camels carrying off precious objects. According to Skylitzes, Maniakes was able to then capture the citadel and, summoning external reinforcements, secure the whole city.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|20}}

Maniakes remained in charge of Edessa for several years and, according to Honigmann and Bosworth, appears to have been relatively autonomous from the Byzantines, merely sending an annual tribute to Constantinople.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|590}} On the other hand, while Skylitzes does mention that "Maniakes sent an annual tribute of 50 pounds [of gold] to the emperor", Niccolò Zorzi remarks that this "does not necessarily imply that Edessa 'enjoyed a certain amount of independence from Byzantium'".<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|21}} The citadel became known as "Maniakes's citadel" at some point.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|21}}

In May 1036, the Numayri prince Ibn Waththab plundered the city and took the ''patricius'' of Edessa as prisoner, but the fortress remained in the hands of the Byzantine garrison.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|590}} A peace treaty was reached in 1037; under its terms, Edessa came directly under Byzantine control and it was refortified.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|590}} Edessa now became an important Byzantine command placed under a series of [[katepano]]s and dukes.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|204}} The "duchy" of Edessa probably comprised the whole area beyond the Euphrates under their control with several fortresses north of the river.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|20}} The city "was still inhabited by many Christians" at this point.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|590}}

In 1065-6 and 1066-7, the city was attacked by the Turkish leader Khurasan-Salar.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|590}} For 50 days beginning on 10 March 1071, Urfa was besieged by the Seljuk sultan [[Alp Arslan]].<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|23}} Alp Arslan eventually lifted the siege in return for a large payment and possibly also the submission of its ruler, the ''doux'' Basilios Alousianos (son of [[Alusian of Bulgaria]]).<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|23}} After the [[Battle of Manzikert]], Edessa was intended to be handed over to the Seljuks, but the Byzantine emperor [[Romanos Diogenes]] was deposed and in the political chaos its katepano Paulus ended up siding with the new emperor.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|590}}

In 1077 or 1078, [[Basil Apokapes]] besieged and captured Edessa, displacing the Byzantine governor Leo Diabatenos.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|23}} He was an agent of [[Philaretos Brachamios]], the main Byzantine agent in the region who governed from Marash; however, Basil ruled Edessa independently.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|205}} In 1081-2, an amir named Khusraw unsuccessfully besieged the city.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|590}} After Basil's death in 1083, the citizens of Edessa elected an Armenian named Smbat to succeed him.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|23}} Smbat was in charge for six months before Philaretos came in person on 23 September 1083.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|590}} He appointed a Greek eunuch as governor and gave him the title ''parakoimomenos''; this eunuch was later assassinated by an official named Barsauma.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|23}}

However, Edessa was in a particularly vulnerable position "caught between two blocks of [[Uqaylid]] territory", and it was particularly vulnerable to the Seljuks.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|205}} In 1086-7, the Seljuk sultan [[Malik Shah I]] sent his general Buzan to take the city<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|205}} while he himself campaigned in Syria.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|23}} A three-month siege followed, with Barsauma defending the city.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|23}} The city surrendered in March 1087 and Buzan appointed a Seljuk commander to head the citadel.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|23}} At some point, an Armenian named [[Thoros of Edessa|Toros]] in charge of the city administration – according to the Syriac ''Chronicle of 1234'', this happened in 1087, while Matthew of Edessa wrote that it happened after Buzan's death in 1094.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|23}} Toros appears to have begun a rebuilding project on the Bey Kapısı fortress, but it wasn't finished until after his rule.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|13}} Meanwhile, Malik Shah had died in 1092 and a Seljuk dynastic crisis had broken out.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|23}} In 1094, Malik Shah's brother [[Tutush I|Tutush]] demanded the city's surrender, but both Toros and the Seljuk citadel commander refused.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|23}} Tutush's forces seized the citadel and made their encampment on the west side of the city.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|23}} Fearing an attack from them, Toros apparently tried to cut the citadel off by building a wall between it and the city.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|23}} After Tutush died in 1095, however, his forces abandoned the citadel and Toros now took control of the whole city as a ''de facto'' independent ruler.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|23}}

During the 11th century, there was a large influx of Armenian immigrants into the region, especially the towns.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|6}} In Urfa, they supplanted Syrians as the leading citizens and wealthiest landowners.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|6}}

===County of Edessa===
[[File:Map County of Edessa 1098-1131-en.svg|thumb|A map of the County of Edessa]]
{{main|County of Edessa}}
Urfa was capital of the crusader [[County of Edessa]] for about half a century beginning in 1098.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|590}} The crusaders' subjects were a mix of Armenians and Syrians.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|6}} In Urfa itself, Armenians were the dominant group.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|6}} The crusaders themselves don't seem to have undertaken much construction in Urfa.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|6}} The only extant structure that can be attributed to them is the southernmost tower of the Bey Kapısı, on the east side of the city walls.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|6}} This was completing the rebuilding that Toros had begun before the crusaders seized Edessa and was finished in 1122-3, while the count [[Joscelin I]] was in captivity at [[Harput]].<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|13}}

====Sieges of 1144 and 1146====

The County of Edessa had survived largely because their Muslim rivals were disunited.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|590}} The rise of a single powerful Muslim rival – namely [[Imad ad-Din Zangi]], the crafty atabeg of [[Mosul]] – spelled disaster for the county.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|590–1}} The tipping point came in late 1144, when [[Joscelin II]] left Edessa with a big chunk of his soldiers to assist Zengi's rival [[Kara Arslan]].<ref name="Gibb 1969">{{cite book |last1=Gibb |first1=Hamilton A.

The fall of Edessa was a direct motivator for the [[Second Crusade]].<ref name="Gibb 1969"/>{{rp|466–8}} Christian pilgrims returning to Europe brought news of the city's conquest, and emissaries from the crusader states also came to appeal for help.<ref name="Gibb 1969"/>{{rp|466}} The pope responded by issuing the [[papal bull]] ''[[Quantum praedecessores]]'' on 1 December 1145, which directly called for another crusade.<ref name="Gibb 1969"/>{{rp|466–7}} Meanwhile, in the Muslim world, news of this victory made Zengi a hero.<ref name="Gibb 1969"/>{{rp|461}} The caliph gave him many gifts and titles, including ''al-malik al-mansūr'' – "the victorious king".<ref name="Gibb 1969"/>{{rp|461}}

The [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid empire]] essentially functioned as a dynastic "confederation of principalities united under one leading prince".<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|212}} During Saladin's reign, he established a principality based at Harran; Urfa was part of this principality.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|213}} After Gökböri, the Harran-Urfa principality was also held by Saladin's brother [[al-Adil I|al-Adil]], who later ruled as the Ayyubid sultan himself.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|213}}

===Mongol rule===
In 1260, Urfa voluntarily submitted to the troops of [[Hulagu]] and thus came under Mongol rule.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|591}} Because the city had surrendered peacefully, its inhabitants were spared.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|591}}

The Mongols never garrisoned Urfa; it was near their western border with the [[Mamluk Sultanate]] and was probably seen as "too difficult to defend".<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|7}} Its ruined fortress was "probably not thought worth repairing".<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|7}} The city was desolate at this point; its inhabitants had evacuated or abandoned it and "only Turcoman nomads lived in the otherwise empty city".<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|7}}

===Mamluk and Aq Qoyunlu rules===
The Mamluks gained control of Urfa sometime in the early 14th century.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|7}} They renovated the ruined citadel probably during the third reign of [[an-Nasir Muhammad]] (1309–40), but the city "attracted few inhabitants".<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|7, 216}} The Mamluk garrison only occupied the citadel itself; the surrounding city was still practically deserted and not worth committing any soldiers to defend.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|218}} Located close to the Mamluks' eastern frontier, Urfa had "no commercial importance" because merchant traffic in Upper Mesopotamia was taking a route through [[Mardin]] and [[Ra's al-'Ayn]] rather than through Amid and Urfa.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|7, 218–9}}

That changed in the late 14th century, toward the end of the Mamluk period.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|7, 218}} Some commercial traffic had begun passing through Urfa enroute to Aleppo, and the city became at least partly repopulated.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|218}} By around 1400, [[al-Qalqashandi]] wrote that Urfa had been rebuilt and was prosperous again.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|591}} Meanwhile, in 1394, [[Timur]] occupied Urfa without much resistance; he "admired the buildings and took away some of the portable wealth".<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|219}}

The [[Aq Qoyunlu]] seized Urfa, a srategic military outpost on their western frontier, in the late 1410s or early 1420s.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|219}} At some point, the Aq Qoyunlu ruler [[Kara Osman]] granted Urfa to his son [[Ali Beg (Aq Qoyunlu)|Ali]], whose quarrels with his brothers beginning in autumn 1428, prompted Kara Osman to replace him with Ali's brother Habil as governor of Urfa.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|59}} Ali left Urfa in 1429 and headed north where he laid siege to Harpoot, which fell before Mamluk aid could come to the city's aid. This prompted the Mamluks to attack Urfa, an Aq Qoyunlu base that posed threat to Mamluk-held Aleppo.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|59}} One day before the main Mamluk army arrived, a "local Arab contingent" reached Urfa and defeated Habil's Turkic forces. The Mamluk army arrived the next day and besieged the city. On 24 July, the citadel surrendered, and the Mamluks demolished the fortress and enslaved the women and children, killing many others. Contemporary historians compared the violent event to [[Siege of Damascus (1400)|Timur's sack of Damascus in 1400]].<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|59}}

In early November 1480, a large Mamluk army under [[Yashbak min Mahdi]], who was ''[[dawatdar|dawātdār-i kabīr]]'' or executive secretary to the Mamluk sultan [[Qaitbay]], laid siege to Urfa.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|60}} Yashbak bombarded the city walls with heavy cannon fire and used catapults to hurl fireballs into the city.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|60}} This happened during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, prompting [[Fazlallah Khunji Isfahani]] to liken Yashbak's actions to the tyrant [[Nimrod]] torturing the prophet Abraham with fire – also in Urfa, according to tradition.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|60}} Aq Qoyunlu forces quickly arrived at Urfa from Diyar Bakr and, after a failed attempt at negotiations, [[Battle of Urfa (1480)|a pitched battle]] took place.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|60}} The Aq Qoyunlu army's right wing was commanded by [[Sulayman Beg Bijan]] and the left wing was commanded by [[Sufi Khalil Beg Mawsilu|Khalil Beg Mawsillu]].<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|60}} The Mamluk forces were utterly defeated, and Yashbak was later executed.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|60}}{{refn|group=note|Contemporary sources give conflicting dates for when this battle took place.

[[File:Semailname 47b.jpg|thumb|[[Suleiman the Magnificent]]'s conquest of Baghdad in 1534 indirectly boosted commerce in Urfa by making regional trade routes safer to travel.]]
<!-- [[File:Balıklıgöl_park_9091.jpg|thumb|Park of Balıklıgöl]] -->

Urfa was likely initially incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the rule of [[Selim I]] around 1517.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|591}} The earliest surviving Ottoman [[defter|tax register]] for Urfa, compiled in 1518, documented 1,082 families (700 Muslim and 382 Christian), suggesting a total population slightly exceeding 5,500 people.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|591}} The relatively low population figure can be attributed to political turmoil in the region, particularly the ongoing conflict with [[Safavid Iran]].<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|591}} By 1526, the city's population had increased to 1,322 families (988 Muslim and 334 Christian), indicating an estimated population of approximately 8,000.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|591}}

Urfa experienced a renaissance under Ottoman rule.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|7}} Industry and commerce picked back up, and its population rebounded, although it never reached the same population heights it had once held in the classical and early medieval periods.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|7}} The high point lasted for about a century and a half, beginning with its conquest by the Ottomans.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|7}} According to Mehmet Adil Saraç, Urfa's population first became majority Turkish sometime during this period, sometime between 1520 and 1570.<ref name="Saraç 2018"/>{{rp|22}} By 1566, a tax register shows the city with an estimated 13,000 to 14,000 people (1,704 Muslim families and 866 Christian families).<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|591}} At this point, the city was described as having five large ''mahalle''s, each named after one of the five city gates, and it "must have had an active textile industry".<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|591}} A [[bedestan]] is also recorded.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|591}} Urfa's prosperity in the 1500s was based on both trade and agricultural production.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|66}} Urfa was an important [[entrepot]] on trade routes between Iran and Aleppo.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|7}}

Because of its prosperity, Urfa's population grew as it attracted residents from nearby cities.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|66}} In 1586, Ottoman authorities created the [[Eyalet of Raqqa]] out of territories that had previously belonged to the [[Eyalet of Diyarbekir]], and Urfa became "the center of economic and political power" in this new province.<ref name="Winter 2009">{{cite journal |last1=Winter |first1=Stefan |title=The Province of Raqqa under Ottoman Rule, 1535–1800 |journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies |date=2009 |volume=68 |pages=253–67 |doi=10.1086/649610 |s2cid=163430587 |url=https://www.academia.edu/3809120 |access-date=16 November 2022}}</ref>{{rp|258}}

At the same time, the city's prosperity attracted bandits and nomadic tribes.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|66–7}} A report from October 1565 indicates that the wealthy, populous villages around Urfa were suffering from banditry, and another report from November 1588 indicates that there was a large-scale uprising of Bedouin tribes in the region.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|67}} For most of the 1500s, this was mostly a rural problem; Urfa itself was mostly unaffected.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|67}} That changed at the end of the century, when the revolt of Karayazıcı Abdulhalim turned Urfa into a battlefield.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|67}}

Relatively little is known about Karayazıcı, but he was presumably a tribesman who worked as a bureaucrat in the local administration (''Yazıcı'' means "scribe").<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|67}} His army was recruited from other local tribal members.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|67}} In 1599–1600 (1008 AH), Karayazıcı's army laid siege to the outer and then inner citadel and thus gained control of Urfa.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|67}} The contemporary historian [[Mustafa Selaniki]] blamed Urfa's fall on the governors of Aleppo and Damascus failing to send reinforcements in time.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|67}} He set up a "quasi-state" based at Urfa's inner citadel, declaring himself sultan and [[Hüseyin Pasha (Celali rebel)|Hüseyin Pasha]] (who had worked with him to capture the citadel) as grand vizier.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|67}} Eventually, though, Ottoman troops (backed by reinforcements from Damascus and Aleppo) surrounded the inner citadel, dug trenches, and engaged the rebels in a bloody battle in the middle of the city.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|68}} The rebels ran into ammunition shortages during the battle and had to melt down coins to use as bullets.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|68}} Hüseyin Pasha was killed in the battle, but Karayazıcı himself managed to escape.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|68}}

The instability accompanying the [[Celali rebellions|Celali revolts]], and especially Karayazıcı's occupation of the city, must have sapped Urfa's prosperity.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|591}} Several 17th-century accounts refer to parts of the town as being in disrepair.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|592}} For example, when [[Jean-Baptiste Tavernier]] visited Urfa in 1644, "there were so many empty lots that [he] compared the town to a desert".<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|592}} The central Ottoman state's control of the surrounding Raqqa Eyalet weakened significantly in the early 1600s.<ref name="Winter 2009"/>{{rp|259}} Powerful ''[[emir|ümera]]'' families from Urfa assumed responsibility for governance of the eyalet, while the actual office of governor was a [[sinecure]] for prominent Ottoman generals or their sons.<ref name="Winter 2009"/>{{rp|259–60}}

Urfa court records from about 1629 to 1631 (1039–40 AH) provide insight into local government during the [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1623-1639)|Ottoman-Safavid War of 1623–1629]].<ref name="Winter 2009"/>{{rp|259}} The Ottomans were in the process of mobilizing troops and resources in the area for the war effort, and the [[qadi]] of Urfa was responsible for [[billet]]ing troops and gathering provisions.<ref name="Winter 2009"/>{{rp|259}} In August 1638, Sultan [[Murad IV]] stayed at Urfa along with his army while en route to Baghdad in [[Capture of Baghdad (1638)|the final campaign of the war]].<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|12}} He ordered restoration work on the citadel, which is mentioned in written sources and confirmed by an inscription on the walls that still exists.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|12}}

The most detailed account of early Ottoman Urfa was written by [[Evliya Çelebi]], who visited the city in 1646.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|591}} Part of his interest may have been because one of his relatives was a qadi here.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|591}} His account mentions only three gates, with different names than those of the 1566 tax register.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|591}} Evliya wrote that he counted 2,600 houses in the fortified part of the city, which probably indicates a population total similar to 1566.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|591}} At this point, Urfa had houses generally made of mud brick; more opulent houses, belonging to paşas and qadis, had their own gardens and baths.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|591}} Evliya also recorded 22 mosques, 3 medreses, and 3 [[zaviye]]s.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|591–2}} He listed several hans, including the Yemiş Hânı, the Samsatkapısı, the Hacı İbrâhim Hânı, the Beykapısı Hânı, and the Sebîl Hânı.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|306}} He also wrote that the city had 400 shops and several mills, including one named after one Tayyaroğlu Ahmed Paşa.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|592}} However, he was apparently unimpressed by the city's shops and markets.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|592}}

Evliya also wrote that Urfa had a [[tannery]] that produced high-quality yellow [[maroquin]] leather.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|592}} Tavernier also noted the city's leather, saying that along with [[Tokat]] and Diyarbakır it produced some of the best maroquin leathers.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|592}} Besides leather, Urfa was also renowned for its cotton fabrics during this period.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|592}}

According to Onur Usta, part of why Urfa appeared to European visitors as "a derelict city with houses reduced to rubble" during this period was because it had a lot of residents from nomadic and tribal backgrounds.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|68}} These people would have still engaged in nomadic [[transhumance]] activities during most parts of the year and "only needed a roof over their heads during the winter".<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|69}} The abandoned-looking houses would have belonged to them.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|69}}

Information about Urfa during the 1700s is relatively scarce, but one source is the fiscal records of the new Rızvaniye Mosque.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|592}} These document the [[waqf]] properties assigned to the mosque, including shops, gardens, mills, and public baths, as well as information about tenants and rents.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|592}} Based on various fiscal and tax documents, it seems that Urfa suffered a series of troubles in the 1750s and began to sink into poverty.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|70}} One of the most serious problems was rampant banditry, which both impeded agricultural production in surrounding rural areas and hindered economic recovery.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|70–1}}

A serious outbreak of plague hit Urfa in the 1780s, and many people died.<ref name="Saraç 2018"/>{{rp|22}} [[Iraqi Turkmen]], particularly from the regions around Mosul and [[Kirkuk]], were deported and resettled in Urfa to help repopulate the city.<ref name="Saraç 2018"/>{{rp|22}} The connection with Kirkuk in particular left cultural and linguistic traces in Urfa, and some present-day Urfalis have described the two cities as having an "uncle-nephew relationship".<ref name="Saraç 2018"/>{{rp|19, 22}}

====19th century====
[[File:Urfa_Regie_church_5489.jpg|thumb|Urfa Reji Church, the structure was built on the remains of a church from the 6th century in 1861.]]
In the Ottoman period, Urfa was a center of commerce because of its location at a crossroads with Diyarbakır, Antep, Mardin, and Raqqa.<ref name="Taş 2019">{{cite book |last1=Taş |first1=Yasin |title=Osmanlı döneminde Urfa'da sosyal hayat (mahkeme kayıtlarına göre 1850–1900) |date=2019 |publisher=Hiperlink Eğitim İletişim Yayıncılık |location=Istanbul |isbn=978-605-281-528-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzfLDwAAQBAJ |access-date=3 October 2022 |language=Turkish}}</ref>{{rp|292}} Many Jewish, Armenian, and Greek merchants were present in Urfa, especially from Aleppo.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|292}}

[[James Silk Buckingham]] visited Urfa in 1816 and ended up stuck there for a while because the roads were closed due to the ongoing [[Ottoman-Wahhabi War]].<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|592}} Buckingham's account of early-1800s Urfa is one of the most informative of the late Ottoman period.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|592}} By this time, the name "Urfa" had come to predominate, with only the city's Arab Christians still calling it "al-Ruha".<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|592}} The standard of living in Urfa had evidently increased since the 1600s – the mud brick houses recorded by Evliya Çelebi had given way to finer masonry structures that Buckingham compared to the houses of Aleppo.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|592}} The houses described by Buckingham had ''[[harem]]'' and ''[[selamlik]]'' quarters separated by a courtyard, with the ''selamlik''s boasting "opulently furnished reception rooms" on their upper floors.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|592}} Buckingham described the city as being divided into [[janissary]] and sharif factions, also like Aleppo.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|592}} Many of the city's bazaars were closed due to the war, but Buckingham noted that Urfa had a thriving [[cotton]] trade during peacetime and observed some of the city's cotton printers at work.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|592}} Coarser wool cloth and rugs were also manufactured in Urfa.<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|592}}

In the mid-1800s, Urfa benefitted from a general increase in commercial activity in the region.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|8}} Most of the larger courtyard houses in the present-day old town probably date from this period.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|8}} The large Armenian church on the western main street was built in 1842 and many mosques were probably also built around this time.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|8}} According to Suraiya Faroqhi, though, the city's population "must have been at a low ebb for several decades in the mid-century".<ref name="Brill EoI"/>{{rp|593}}

[[File:Urfa_Kitchen_Museum_building_3309.jpg|thumb|left|Urfa Kitchen Museum Building]]
However, in the late 1800s, Urfa declined in importance as a commercial center.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|292}} In particular, the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869 caused a major realignment of trade routes, shifting away from overland caravans and towards maritime commerce.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|292}} As a result, the volume of commercial traffic coming through Urfa decreased markedly compared to previous periods and became increasingly local/regional in nature.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|292}} The local economy shifted away from producing goods for export and toward meeting the basic needs of the local population.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|292}} Workshops produced less in general during this period and their focus was more on cheap basic goods like local fabrics and household goods.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|292}} Imports also declined because the locals were focusing more on consuming cheap basic goods rather than luxuries; they were living simpler, more frugal lives.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|292}} Because people were using more local products, the cost of living also decreased and people had to work less to meet their expenses.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|292–3}} Contemporary court records document that there was extensive commercial contact between Muslims and non-Muslims; they bought and sold goods freely between each other and entered into commercial partnerships together, indicating that there was relatively high trust between both groups.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|293–4}}

The main centers of commercial activity in the Ottoman period were the bazaars, where both local and imported goods were bought and sold.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|309}} Generally, a bazaar would be named after its primary function and main goods sold there.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|309}} For example, the İsotçular Çarşısı was named because of the homemade chili peppers sold in this street.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|309}} Among the bazaars mentioned in late 19th-century records: Kadıoğlu, Köroğlu, Eski Arasa, Teymurcu, Sarayönü, Belediye, Beykapı, Akar, Sipâhî, Bedestan, Hânönü, Kafavhâne, and Hüseyniye.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|309}}

There was a huge increase in the number of hans recorded in the ''Aleppo [[Salname]]''s in the late 1800s: from just 7 in 1867 to 11 in 1888, 18 in 1889, and 32 in 1898.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|306}} According to Yasin Taş, this is because not only were new hans being built, but records were simply counting more types of commercial buildings as hans.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|306}} Muslim and non-Muslim travelers would both use the same hans regardless of religion.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|309}}

In the countryside surrounding Urfa, life went on largely unchanged.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|314}} Most rural villagers were involved in agriculture, and farmlands were typically plowed using the same low-tech methods that had been used for thousands of years.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|314}} Cows and oxen were kept as draft animals.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|314}} Irrigated farmland around the Euphrates and some streams was more expensive than the waterless fields called "deştî land" which was not able to be irrigated.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|314}} Irrigation channels were repaired jointly among the people who used the water.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|314}} Sometimes there would be people living in the city (often non-Muslim) who would own farmland outside the city and deputize local villagers (often Muslim) to run the farm under the muzâraa contract.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|314–5}} In 1846, taxes could not be collected because of drought and locusts.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|315}} In 1861, 1863, and 1886, there were locusts; in 1870 there was a drought due to lack of rain.<ref name="Taş 2019"/>{{rp|315}}

Up until the mid-1890s, about 20,000 of the city's 60,000 residents were Armenians.<ref name="Miller 1995"/>{{rp|620}} In 1895, however, thousands of Armenians were killed in a series of massacres by both civilians and soldiers.<ref name="Miller 1995"/>{{rp|620}} First, in October, Turkish and Kurdish locals killed hundreds of Armenians over a two-day period.<ref name="Miller 1995"/>{{rp|620}} Then for two months the Armenian quarter was effectively subjected to a siege, with no food or water allowed in.<ref name="Miller 1995"/>{{rp|620}} The Turks claimed that the Armenians had a weapon cache, which they demanded in return for lifting the siege.<ref name="Miller 1995"/>{{rp|620}} In December, the siege ended when "a crowd of Turkish soldiers and civilians" entered the Armenian quarter and killed thousands of its inhabitants.<ref name="Miller 1995"/>{{rp|620}} About 3,000 survivors sought shelter in a nearby church – which is normally recognized as a place of refuge under Islamic law.<ref name="Miller 1995"/>{{rp|620}} However, soldiers burned the church to the ground, killing everyone inside.<ref name="Miller 1995"/>{{rp|620}} The troops went on to loot and burn the rest of the Armenian quarter.<ref name="Miller 1995"/>{{rp|620}} According to [[Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|Lord Kinross]], some 8,000 Armenians were killed in total.<ref>{{cite book | first = Lord | last = Kinross | author-link = Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross | title = The Ottoman Centuries, The Rise and Fall of the Turkish Empire | publisher = [[Harper Perennial]] | year = 1977 | location = United States | isbn = 0-688-08093-6 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/ottomancenturies00kinr/page/560 560] | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/ottomancenturies00kinr/page/560 }}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Göbekli Tepe - landscape.jpg|thumb|The Urfa countryside, as seen from [[Göbekli Tepe]]]]
Urfa is located at the border between the foothills of the [[Taurus Mountains]] and the great Mesopotamian plain. In general, these two regions meet "well to the south" of Urfa, but around [[Harran]] the plain extends northward, cutting into the hills. At the northwestern corner of the Harran plain, there is another extension in the plain, this time going westward. Urfa is located in this second extension of the plains, tucked behind the hills at its southern edge.<ref name="Sinclair 1990">{{cite book |last1=Sinclair |first1=T. A. |title=Eastern Turkey: An Architectural and Archaeological Survey, Volume IV |date=1990 |publisher=The Pindar Press |location=London |isbn=0-907132-52-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6CMnEAAAQBAJ |access-date=20 March 2022}}</ref>{{rp|1}}

A small stream flows through Urfa.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|2}} This stream is known as the [[Daisan River|Daisan]], or "leaping river", after its tendency for flooding.<ref name="Unfinished"/>{{rp|136}} Today, the Daisan flows through a man-made channel that follows the north and east sides of the old walled city. Before the channel was made, though, the stream's natural course was on the west side of the old city, then it turned east.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|2}} Part of the former course survives as the fish pool called Birket Ibrahim, which tradition associates with the  patriarch [[Abraham]]. To the south of the stream's old course is a spring in a cave that is now converted into a mosque.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|3, 6}}

Since the 20th century, Urfa has expanded northward, across the little plain and the hill known as Şehitlik Mahallesi with blocks of flats, as well as over the escarpment to the south.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|8}}

===Climate===
Urfa has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa,'' [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Cs''). During the summer months, average high temperatures often exceed {{Convert|40|C|F}} and it has one of the hottest summers in the world among places that are not in [[Desert climate|arid]] or [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] regions, while rainfall is almost non-existent. Winters are cool and relatively wet, frost is common along with very sporadic snowfall. Spring and autumn are warm and moderately dry.

Highest recorded temperature: {{Convert|46.8|C|F}} on 30 July 2000<br>Lowest recorded temperature: {{Convert|-12.4|C|F}} on 9 February 1932<ref name=MGM/>

===The citadel===
[[Şanlıurfa Castle|Urfa castle]] is located on the rocky heights south of the historical city center.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|3}} It is long and thin because it crowns a ridge.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|8}}

The hilltop was the site of an Abgarid winter palace built in the 3rd century; the two columns are the only remnant of this palace.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|11}} The first known fortification of the site dates from the early 6th century, under the emperor Justinian.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|11}} Fortifications may have existed here previously, but if they did then they went unrecorded.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|11}}

The fortress was generally well-maintained during the middle ages, and it withstood a number of attacks.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|11–2}} It was destroyed on the orders of the Ayyubid sultan [[al-Kamil]] around 1235.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|12}} In the early 1300s, it was rebuilt under the Mamluk sultan [[an-Nasir Muhammad]].<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|12}} It was further renovated under the Aq Qoyunlu in the 1400s, and then again under the Ottomans at various points: under [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in the 1500s and then under [[Murad IV]] in the early 1600s.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|12}}

Urfa's castle was garrisoned with [[janissary|janissaries]] until [[Auspicious Incident|their dissolution in 1826]].<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|70}} It was already in serious disrepair by that point, though; only the part where the janissaries were posted was maintained at all.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|71}} Afterwards, the citadel was essentially abandoned.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|71}} In 1849, a local citizen named Sakıp Efendi dismantled part of the citadel and used the stones to build an inn and market; he also allegedly took a lot of stones to sell for money.<ref name="Tonghini 2021"/>{{rp|71}}

===Old city walls===
[[File:Urfa city walls 5424.jpg|thumb|Some stretches of the old city walls remain standing]]
[[File:Urfa Barla Kapısı 3567.jpg|thumb|Inner face of the Harran Gate]]
The monumental walls surrounding the old town date from the Abbasid-era rebuilding in 812.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|12}} The only major repairs to them took place during the early Ottoman period, in 1660–61, when there was restoration work done on the city's fortifications in general.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|12}} The walls are made of large stone blocks over 30&nbsp;cm tall all the way through (i.e. not just on the faces).<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|12}} The early Ottoman repairs are distinguished by their small size, white color, and light bossing.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|12}} In many places, people have built private houses directly adjoining the city wall's inner face, so that it forms one side of the house.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|12}} Because of Urfa's location, the east wall was always the most exposed to attack; large chunks of the surviving sections here consist of Ottoman repairs.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|14}}

There were three known gates in the city walls: the Harran Gate; the Bey Kapısı, or "Lord's Gate"; and the Saray Kapısı, or "Palace Gate".<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|12–4}} The Harran Gate, located near the southeast corner of the walled city, still exists; its outer face (outside the walls) was rebuilt at some point, possibly during the Ottoman renovations of 1660–61.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|12}} Its inner face, however, dates back to the Ayyubid period, under the local ruler Muzaffar Ghazi Shihab ad-Din (1230–45).<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|12}} The inscription recording his name runs almost from one end of the gatehouse to the other; below it, and above the top of the arch, is a small relief of a [[eagle of Saladin|double-headed eagle]].<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|12}}

The monumental Bey Kapısı, located on the east side of the old city, also still exists, although the actual gate no longer does.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|13}} The original gatehouse was built in ancient times, perhaps during the 4th or 6th century.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|13}} It probably had two large U-shaped towers with two or three gates in between them.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|13}} Those two towers still exist today, although they were completely rebuilt over the centuries so that none of the original structures remain.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|13}} The south tower kept its shape, but the north tower is now shaped like a polygon with straight sides.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|13}} The entire gatehouse was turned into a fortress in the early middle ages.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|13}} This may have happened during the Abbasid rebuilding of the city walls in 812, but in any case it had already happened by the early 11th century when sources refer to two castles in the city.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|13}} The fortress consisted of a rectangular enclosure with the two towers on its east side; the north tower was probably rebuilt at this point.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|13}} The fortress's entire eastern wall appears to have been moved back by about 12&nbsp;m and the old gates were closed up in the process.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|13}} The new gate was built at the northwest corner of the fortress, between it and the main city wall, so that there was a passage between them.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|13}} At some point, this passage was blocked up.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|13}} The Armenian prince Toros appears to have begun a rebuilding of the Bey Kapısı fortress, as attested by an Armenian inscription on the south tower, but this project was only finished under the crusaders.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|13–4}} Later, during the Ottoman renovations of 1660–61, the fortress was rebuilt again.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|13}} In the mid-1800s, the entire fortress was converted into a private residence, and rebuilding from this period has replaced most of the earlier masonry in many places.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|13–4}}

As for the Saray Kapısı, it no longer exists, but it was originally located behind the bridge that takes Atatürk Caddesi over the river on the north side of town.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|14}}

===Balıklıgöl===
{{main|Balıklıgöl}}
[[File:Balikli Göl 03.jpg|thumb|right|Abraham's Pool in Urfa]]
According to legend, Balıklıgöl was formed by the prophet Abraham's confrontation with the tyrant Nimrod, who supposedly ruled over Urfa from the citadel above.<ref name="Unfinished"/>{{rp|138}} When Abraham came of age, he destroyed Nimrod's idols, and in retaliation Nimrod "made a catapult out of the castle's twin pillars" and hurled Abraham into a pit of fire below.<ref name="Unfinished"/>{{rp|138}} When Abraham landed, the flames miraculously turned into water, and the wood used to stoke the fire was turned into carp.<ref name="Unfinished"/>{{rp|138}}

====Halil ür-Rahman Cami====
[[File:Halil Ür-Rahman Camii 9397.jpg|thumb|The Halil ür-Rahman Cami]]
The Halil ür-Rahman Cami, also called simply the Halil Cami, is a mosque and medrese located on the south side of the pool.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|18}} Just south of the mosque is a cave which according to legend is where the prophet Abraham was born.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|18}} Another tradition says that Abraham intended to sacrifice his son Isaac here, but sacrificed a goat instead; when he did, a spring gushed out, feeding the fish pool.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|18}}

The earliest part of the complex is the minaret, which was built in 1211–12 under Ayyubid rule.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|18}} There was presumably a mosque with a prayer hall on the site of the present one, which was completely rebuilt in 1819–20 (but probably similar to the original one).<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|18–9}} The other major component is a series of medrese "cells", fronted by a portico, which were built in 1808–09 and then renovated in 1871–72.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|19}} The original Ayyubid complex may have been built to serve as a medrese, but by Ottoman times it was being used as a [[khanqah|tekke]] with kitchens, reception rooms, and guest rooms, which may have been on the same site as the medrese cells.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|19}} The tekke complex was converted into a medrese in the 1800s, possibly as soon as the medrese cells were built.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|19}}

The mosque itself now serves as an antechamber where prayers can be said before entering the cave through a door on the south side.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|19}} The mosque is entered through a domed vestibule on the west side.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|19}} The prayer hall is a small squarish room with three aisles; two of them have groin-vaulted ceilings, while the middle one is topped with a dome.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|19}} The mihrab is surrounded by an arch with [[squinch]]es that seem to imitate [[Artukid]] style.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|19}}

The minaret is a square tower that is visually divided into thirds by three molded [[cornice]]s, one of which is at the very top.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|19}} The upper level has pairs of [[mullion]]ed windows on all four sides.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|19}} The tops of the windows form horseshoe-shaped arches.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|19}}

The medrese cells, now used as a Qur'an school, are elevated from the surrounding pavement.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|19}} The cells are fronted by a portico with simple rounded arches.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|19}} A [[balustrade]] with zigzag posts runs along the front of the portico.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|19}} At the northwest corner of the pool is a five-sided room that projects out into the water on three sides.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|19}} A restoration in the late 20th century extended the balustrade onto the top of the five-sided room.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|19}}

====Ayn Zeliha====
The pool of Ayn Zeliha, named after Nimrod's daughter,<ref name="Rough Guide"/> is located south of the main pool.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|18}} It is shaded by trees and surrounded by cafés.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|18}}

== Religious significance ==
According to some [[Jewish]] and [[Muslim]] sources, Urfa is [[Ur Kasdim]], the hometown of [[Abraham]], the grandfather of [[Jacob]].

Urfa is also one of several cities that have traditions associated with [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]].

=== Cuisine ===
[[File:Patlıcan kebap at an Urfa restaurant.jpg|thumb|Patlıcan kebap, served at an Urfa-style restaurant in Ankara]]
As the city of Urfa is deeply rooted in history, so its unique cuisine is an amalgamation of the cuisines of the many civilizations that have ruled in Urfa . It is widely believed that Urfa is the birthplace of many dishes, including [[Çiğ köfte]], that according to the legend, was crafted by the Prophet Abraham from ingredients he had at hand.<ref>From Kâtib el Bağdadî in p.196''Urfa'da Pişer Bize de Düşer'', Halil & Munise Yetkin Soran, Alfa Yayın, 2009, Istanbul {{ISBN|978-605-106-065-1}}</ref>

=== Hospitality ===
Urfali society traditionally places a great value on [[hospitality]], and inviting guests over and sharing food with them has a special importance.<ref name="Aksoy and Sezgi 2015"/>{{rp|86}} Locals attribute this to the prophet Abraham, who according to legend never dined alone — he always had guests over to share his meals with.<ref name="Aksoy and Sezgi 2015"/>{{rp|86}} The locally common epithet "''Halil İbrahim Sofrası''" ("the tablecloth-like") depicts this characterization.<ref name="Aksoy and Sezgi 2015"/>{{rp|86}}

Urfa has a long history of literature, going back to early Christian writers such as [[Bardaisan]] and [[Ibas of Edessa]].<ref name="Saraç 2018"/>{{rp|106}} A prominent medieval writer from Urfa was the 9th century Arabic author [[al-Ruhawi]], whose ''[[Adab al-Tabib]]'' covered the topic of [[medical ethics]].<ref name="Levey 1967">{{cite journal |last1=Levey |first1=Martin |title=Medical Ethics of Medieval Islam with Special Reference to Al-Ruhāwī's "Practical Ethics of the Physician" |journal=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society Transactions of the American Philosophical Society |date=1967 |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=1–100 |doi=10.2307/1006137 |jstor=1006137 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1006137 |access-date=28 December 2022}}</ref>{{rp|8}} Later, from the 1600s to the 20th century, ''[[divan (poetry)|divan]]'' poetry became popular in Urfa.<ref name="Saraç 2018"/>{{rp|107}} The popularity of divan poetry in Urfa is unusual because, by the 1600s, Urfa was not a major center of learning that would typically be expected to produce a lot of poetry.<ref name="Saraç 2018"/>{{rp|107}} In all, 130 different Urfali poets are known from this period.<ref name="Saraç 2018"/>{{rp|107}} A few of them are [[Yusuf Nabi|Nâbî]], Ömer Nüzhet, Admî, Fehim, Hikmet, Şevket, Sakıb, and Emin.<ref name="Saraç 2018"/>{{rp|108}} Many of them were Sufis, affiliated with orders like the [[Bektashi]]s, [[Mevlevi Order|Mevlevi]]s, [[Naqshbandi]]s, [[Qadiriyya|Qadiri]]s, and [[Rifa'i]]s; they gathered in places like the Hasanpaşa Medrese, the İhlasiye Medrese, the Hasan Paşa Medrese, the Sakıbiye Tekke, the Halil’ür Rahman Medrese, the Rızvaniye Medrese, the Dabbakhane Medrese, and the Eyyübî Medrese.<ref name="Saraç 2018"/>{{rp|108}} Urfali divan poets almost exclusively used the [[ghazala]] form, with almost no known examples of the [[qasida]].<ref name="Saraç 2018"/>{{rp|108}}

=== Traditional house architecture ===
[[File:Şanlıurfa Provincial Directorate of Culture and Tourism building 9128.jpg|thumb|Şanlıurfa Provincial Directorate of Culture and Tourism Building]]

Urfa's old town has many old courtyard houses; many were built during a construction boom in the 19th century.<ref name="Sinclair 1990"/>{{rp|8}} A typical Urfa courtyard house is centered around a high-walled courtyard that is closed to the street.<ref name="Erdogan 2016">{{cite journal |last1=Erdogan |first1=Nevnihal |title=Investigating the Relationship Between Culture and Traditional Housing Architecture in Urfa, Turkey |journal=Journal of Architectural and Planning Research |date=2016 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=309–25 |jstor=44987208 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44987208 |access-date=30 November 2022}}</ref>{{rp|311, 6}} Facing the courtyard is a [[portico]]ed antechamber covered by a roof and partially surrounded by three walls.<ref name="Erdogan 2016"/>{{rp|317}} In Urfa, the name for this space is ''mastaba''; elsewhere, the more general term is ''[[iwan]]''.<ref name="Erdogan 2016"/>{{rp|317}} Other typical rooms include bedrooms, a kitchen (''tandir''), a [[sitting room]], or a [[water closet]].<ref name="Erdogan 2016"/>{{rp|316–7}} There is also a semi-basement called the ''zerzembe'', which is used for winter food storage and is practically omnipresent in traditional Turkish homes in regions with hot climates.<ref name="Erdogan 2016"/>{{rp|316–7}} The house as a whole, with its courtyard, mastaba, and other rooms, forms one integrated living space rather than each room being its own "isolated, independent" space.<ref name="Erdogan 2016"/>{{rp|318}}

[[File:Hacı Hafız Ahmet Balak Efendi Evi 3101.jpg|thumb|The Hacı Hafız house, now used as an art gallery, is a good example of traditional Urfa house architecture from the 1800s. The grand ''mastaba'' is in the middle. Below it is the entrance to the ''zerzembe''.]]
An important consideration in domestic architecture is ''mahremiyat'', which could roughly be translated into English as "privacy" or "intimacy" but which carries stronger implications.<ref name="Erdogan 2016"/>{{rp|313}} This concept is especially important when it comes to relations between men and women – outside the extended family, interaction between men and women is restricted.<ref name="Erdogan 2016"/>{{rp|313}} As a result, traditional Urfa houses are constructed in ways to prevent men outside from viewing the women of the household.<ref name="Erdogan 2016"/>{{rp|319–20}} For example, doors facing each other, windows facing the street, and significant differences in roof elevation are all avoided.<ref name="Erdogan 2016"/>{{rp|313}}

=== Local Turkish dialect ===
The Turkish spoken in Urfa has some features in common with the variety of [[Iraqi Turkmen#Language|Iraqi Turkmen]] spoken in Kirkuk, as well as some features owed to Arabic influence.<ref name="Saraç 2018"/>{{rp|19}} For example, the Arabic sounds ''[[Ayin#Arabic ʿayn|'ayn]]'', ''[[ghayn]]'', and ''[[qoph#Arabic qāf|qāf]]'' are pronounced the same in Urfa as they are in Arabic, which is not done in standard Turkish.<ref name="Saraç 2018"/>{{rp|19}}
