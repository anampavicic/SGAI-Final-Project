'''Mazar-i-Sharīf''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|z|æ|r|i|_|ʃ|ə|ˈ|r|iː|f}} {{respell|mə|ZARR|ee|_|shə|REEF}}; [[Dari]] and {{lang-ps|مزار شریف}}), also known as '''Mazar-e Sharīf''' or simply '''Mazar''', is the [[List of cities in Afghanistan|third-largest city]] in [[Afghanistan]] by population, with an estimated 500,207 residents in 2021.<ref name=nsia/> It is the capital of [[Balkh province]] and is linked by highways with [[Kunduz]] in the east, [[Kabul]] in the southeast, [[Herat]] in the southwest and [[Termez]], [[Uzbekistan]] in the north. It is about {{convert|55|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Uzbek border. The city is also a tourist attraction because of its famous shrines as well as the [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] and [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] archeological sites. The ancient city of [[Balkh]] is also nearby.

The region around Mazar-i-Sharif has been historically part of [[Greater Khorasan]] and was controlled by the [[Tahirid dynasty|Tahirids]] followed by the [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarids]], [[Samanid Empire|Samanids]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Ghurid dynasty|Ghurids]], [[Ilkhanids]], [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]], and [[Khanate of Bukhara]] until 1751 when it became part of the [[Durrani Empire]] (although under autonomous emirs). Eventually the city passed to a few local rulers before becoming part of Afghanistan in 1849.

Mazar-i-Sharif is the regional hub of northern Afghanistan, located in close proximity to both Uzbekistan and [[Tajikistan]]. It is also home to [[Mazar-i-Sharif International Airport|an international airport]]. It has the highest percentage of built-up land (91%)<ref>{{cite web|title=The State of Afghan Cities Report 2015|url=http://unhabitat.org/books/soac2015_volume2/|access-date=21 October 2015|ref=UN-Habitat|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031111658/http://unhabitat.org/books/soac2015_volume2/|archive-date=31 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> of all the Afghan provincial capitals, and it has additional built-up area extending beyond the municipal boundary but forming a part of the larger [[urban area]]. It is also the lowest-lying major city in the country, about {{convert|357|m|ft|0}} above sea level. The city was spared the devastation that occurred in the country's other large cities during the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] and subsequent [[Afghan Civil War (1992–1996)|civil war]], and was long regarded as one of the safest cities in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/02/afghanistan-mazar-sharif-united-nations|title=Afghanistan: when gentle Mazar-e-Sharif erupted in violence|first=Jon|last=Boone|date=2 April 2011|website=the Guardian|access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref>

On 14 August 2021, Mazar-i-Sharif was seized by [[Taliban]] fighters, becoming the twenty-fifth provincial capital to be captured by the Taliban as part of the wider [[2021 Taliban offensive]].

==Etymology==
The name ''Mazar-i-Sharif'' means "tomb of the saint", a reference to the tomb of [[Ali]], cousin, son-in-law and companion of the [[Islam|Islamic]] prophet [[Muhammad]]. The tomb is housed in the large, blue-tiled sanctuary and mosque in the center of the city known as the [[Hazrat Ali Mazar|Shrine of Ali]] or the Blue Mosque.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/afghanistan/mazaresharif.html|title=The heartbreak of Mazar-e-Sharif|date=January 27, 2004|work=CBC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128191245/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/afghanistan/mazaresharif.html |archive-date=January 28, 2013 }}</ref>

==History==
===Ancient period===
The [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]] controlled the region from the sixth century BCE. [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the area but it was then incorporated into the [[Seleucid Empire]] after his death. The decline of the Seleucids consequently led to the emergence of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian kingdom]]. Around 130 BCE, the [[Saka]]s occupied the region and the Greco-Bactrian kingdom fell. The [[Yuezhi]] took Mazar-i-Sharif and the surrounding area which led to the creation of the [[Kushan Empire]]. The [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]] subsequently controlled the area after the fall of the Kushans. The Islamic conquests reached Mazar-i-Sharif in 651 CE.<ref>{{Cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|year=1996|isbn=1-884964-04-4|editor-last=Schellinger|editor-first=Paul|location=Chicago|pages=578–579|editor-last2=Salkin|editor-first2=Robert}}</ref>

===9th century until 1919===
The region around [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] has been historically part of [[Greater Khorasan]] and was controlled by the [[Tahirid dynasty|Tahirids]] followed by the [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarids]], [[Samanids]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Ghurid dynasty|Ghurids]], [[Ilkhanids]], [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]], and [[Khanate of Bukhara]].

[[File:Mazar-i-Sharif & Band-e-Amir Fan.jpg|thumb|Mazar-i-Sharif & surroundings from [[ISS]], 2016]]
The poet [[Rumi|Jalal al-Din Rumi]] was born somewhere in this area. His father Baha' Walad was descended from the first caliph [[Abu Bakr]].

The [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] sultan [[Ahmed Sanjar]] ordered a city and shrine to be built on the location, which was later destroyed by [[Genghis Khan]] and his Mongol army in the 13th century, and then rebuilt. During the nineteenth century, due to the absence of drainage systems and the weak economy of the region, the excess water of this area flooded many acres of the land in the vicinity of residential areas causing a malaria epidemic in the region. The ruler of North Central Afghanistan decided to move the capital to Mazar-i-Sharif.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afghanmagazine.com/april98/journey/balkh.html|title=Balkh: The Land of Hopes|author=Daud Saba|year=1998|website=www.afghanmagazine.com|access-date=22 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010415205227/http://www.afghanmagazine.com/april98/journey/balkh.html|archive-date=15 April 2001|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The city along with the region south of the [[Amu Darya]] became part of the [[Durrani Empire]] in around 1751. For the most part the region was controlled by autonomous Uzbek rulers). After the Bukharan-Durrani war of 1788–1790, Qilich Ali Beg of [[Kholm, Afghanistan|Khulm]] formed a mini-empire stretching from Balkh to [[Aybak, Samangan|Aybak]], [[Sayghan District|Saighan]], [[Kahmard]], [[Darah Sof District|Darra-i Suf]], and [[Kunduz Province|Qunduz]].<ref name=":34">{{Cite book|last=Noelle|first=Christine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ylTi-e2C_0IC|title=State and Tribe in Nineteenth-Century Afghanistan: The Reign of Amir Dost Muhammad Khan (1826–1863)|date=2012-06-25|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-60317-4|language=en}}</ref> When he died in 1817, the [[Balkh]] and Mazar-i Sharif region became an independent city state with Aqcha as its dependency.

===Late 20th century===
During the 1980s [[Soviet–Afghan War]], Mazar-i-Sharif was a strategic base for the [[Soviet Army]] as they used its airport to launch air strikes on [[mujahideen]] rebels. Mazar-i-Sharif was also the main city that linked to Soviet territory in the north, especially the roads leading to the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic]]. As a garrison for the Soviet-backed [[Afghan Army]], the city was under the command of General [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]]. Mujahideen militias [[Hezbe Wahdat]] and [[Jamiat-e Islami]] both attempted to contest the city but were repelled by the Army.
Dostum mutinied against [[Mohammad Najibullah]]'s government on March 19, 1992, shortly before its collapse, and formed his new party and militia, [[Junbish-e Milli]]. The party took over the city the next day. Afterwards Mazar-i-Sharif became the ''[[de facto]]'' capital of a relatively stable and secular [[proto-state]] in northern Afghanistan under the rule of Dostum. The city remained peaceful and prosperous, whilst rest of the nation disintegrated and was slowly taken over by fundamentalist [[Taliban]] forces.<ref>''The Last Warlord: The Life and Legend of Dostum, the Afghan Warrior Who Led US Special Forces to Topple the Taliban Regime'' by Brian Glyn Williams, 2013</ref> The city was called at the time a "glittering jewel in Afghanistan's battered crown". Money rolled in from foreign donors [[Russia]], [[Turkey]], newly independent [[Uzbekistan]] and others, with whom Dostum had established close relations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/21/afghanistan.terrorism2|title=Fighters to repay Taliban cruelty|first=Chris Stephen in Dashti|last=Qala|date=20 October 2001|website=the Guardian|access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref> He printed his own currency for the region and established his own airline. The city remained relatively liberal as [[Kabul]] previously was, where activities such as coeducational schools and betting was legal as opposed to the Taliban dominated regions in the south of the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1084846.html|title=Afghanistan: Taliban Tries To Consolidate Hold On Rebel Stronghold|newspaper=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=9 April 2008 |last1=Recknagel |first1=Charles }}</ref>

This peace was shattered in May 1997 when he was betrayed by one of his generals, warlord [[Abdul Malik Pahlawan]] who allied himself with the Taliban, forcing him to flee from Mazar-i-Sharif as the Taliban were getting ready to take the city through Pahlawan. Afterwards Pahlawan himself mutinied the Taliban on the deal and it was reported that between May and July 1997 that Pahlawan executed thousands of Taliban members, that he personally did many of the killings by slaughtering the prisoners as a revenge for the 1995 death of [[Abdul Ali Mazari]]. "He is widely believed to have been responsible for the brutal massacre of up to 3,000 Taliban prisoners after inviting them into Mazar-i-Sharif."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1615824.stm#pahlawan |title=Afghan powerbrokers: Who's who |work=BBC News |date=November 19, 2001|access-date=2011-04-01}}</ref> Several of the Taliban escaped the slaughtering and reported what had happened. Meanwhile, Dostum came back and took the city again from Pahlawan.

However the Taliban retaliated in 1998 [[Battles of Mazar-i-Sharif (1997–1998)|attacking the city]] and killing an estimated 8,000 [[non-combatant]]s. At 10 am on 8 August 1998, the Taliban entered the city and for the next two days drove their pickup trucks "up and down the narrow streets of Mazar-i-Sharif shooting to the left and right and killing everything that moved—shop owners, cart pullers, women and children shoppers and even goats and donkeys."<ref name=rashid-73>Rashid,''Taliban'' (2000), p.73.</ref> More than 8000 noncombatants were reported killed in Mazar-i-Sharif and later in [[Bamiyan]].<ref>Goodson, ''Afghanistan's Endless War'', (2001), p.79.</ref> In addition, the Taliban were criticized for forbidding anyone from burying the corpses for the first six days (contrary to the injunctions of Islam, which demands immediate burial) while the remains rotted in the summer heat and were eaten by dogs.<ref>[https://www.hrw.org/reports98/afghan/Afrepor0-02.htm#P114_24041 THE MASSACRE IN MAZAR-I SHARIF, THE FIRST DAY OF THE TAKEOVER].</ref> The Taliban also reportedly sought out and massacred members of the [[Hazara people|Hazara]], while in control of Mazar.<ref name=rashid-73/>

===Since 2001===
{{Further|Fall of Mazar-i-Sharif|War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|International Security Assistance Force|2021 Taliban offensive}}
Following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, Mazar-i-Sharif was the first Afghan city to fall to the U.S.-backed [[Northern Alliance]] (United Front). The Taliban's defeat in Mazar quickly turned into a rout from the rest of the north and west of Afghanistan. After the [[Battle of Mazar-i-Sharif]] in November 2001, the city was officially captured by forces of the Northern Alliance. They were joined by the [[United States Special Operations Forces]] and supported by [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] aircraft. As many as 3,000 Taliban fighters who surrendered were reportedly massacred by the Northern Alliance after the battle, and reports also place U.S. ground troops at the scene of the massacre.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/sep/14/afghanistan.lukeharding|title=Afghan Massacre Haunts Pentagon |work=The Guardian|date=2002-09-14 |location=London |first=Luke |last=Harding |access-date=2010-05-12}}</ref> The Irish documentary ''[[Afghan Massacre: The Convoy of Death]]'' investigated these allegations.

[[File:Luftwaffe Tornados in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|[[Camp Marmal]], located south of the city next to [[Mazar-i-Sharif Airport]]]]
The city slowly came under the control of the [[Presidency of Hamid Karzai|Karzai administration]] after 2002, which is led by [[President of Afghanistan|President]] [[Hamid Karzai]]. The [[209th Corps (Afghanistan)|209th Corps (Shaheen)]] of the [[Afghan National Army]] is based at Mazar-i-Sharif, which provides [[military of Afghanistan|military]] assistance to northern Afghanistan. The [[Afghan Border Police]] headquarters for the Northern Zone is also located in the city. Despite the security put in place, there are reports of Taliban activities and [[assassination]]s of tribal elders. Officials in Mazar-i-Sharif reported that between 20 and 30 Afghan tribal elders have been assassinated in [[Balkh Province]] in the last several years. There is no conclusive evidence as to who is behind it but majority of the victims are said to have been associated with the [[Hezb-i Islami]] political party.<ref name="PAN-assassinations"/>

Small-scale clashes between militias belonging to different commanders persisted throughout 2002, and were the focus of intensive UN peace-brokering and small arms disarmament programme. After some pressure, an office of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission opened an office in Mazar in April 2003. There were reports about northern [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] civilians being ethnically cleansed by the other groups, mainly by ethnic Tajiks, Hazaras and Uzbeks.<ref name="USAToday"/>

[[International Security Assistance Force|NATO-led peacekeeping forces]] in and around the city provided assistance to the Afghan government.

In November 2018, [[VOA]] reported that 40 houses in Qazil Abad, an immediate [[suburb]] of Mazar-i-Sharif, used [[Unexploded ordnance|unexploded]] [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Grad missile|Grad]] [[surface-to-surface missile|surface-to-surface rockets]] as construction materials. As a result, several people were killed and wounded from explosions over the years. These rockets, left behind by the [[Soviet Army]] in 1989 at the end of the [[Soviet–Afghan War]], were used as cheap building materials by the poor residents of the village. It was estimated that over 400 rockets were incorporated into the village as wall and ceiling beams, door-stoppers, and even footbridges used by children. When the rest of the world discovered this fact, the [[Danish demining group]] of the [[Danish Refugee Council]] visited the village and, after asking the residents, began [[demining]] and rebuilding the village, safely removing and disposing of the rockets through [[Controlled explosion|controlled detonation]] at the [[Afghanistan–Uzbekistan border|border with Uzbekistan]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-village-uses-live-rockets-to-build-homes-bridges-/4690545.html|title=Afghan Village Uses Live Rockets to Build Homes, Bridges|author1=Mirwais Bezhan|author2=Mohammad Habibzada|date=6 December 2018|work=[[VOA]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-47137978|title=The village built from missiles|work=BBC News }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06ygr65|title=BBC World Service – The Fifth Floor, The village made of missiles|website=BBC|date=18 January 2019 }}</ref>

{{Further|Economy of Afghanistan}}
[[File:Berezka (5778258455).jpg|thumb|Store in Mazar-i-Sharif with [[Russian language|Russian]] name in Cyrillic]]
Mazar-i-Sharif serves as the major trading center in northern Afghanistan. The local economy is dominated by trade, agriculture and [[Karakul sheep|Karakul]] [[sheep farming]]. Small-scale oil and gas exploitation have also boosted the city's prospects. It is also the location of consulates of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] for trading and political links.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mazar-e-Sharif Consular Affairs – Ministry of Foreign Affairs |url=https://mofa.gov.pk/mazar-e-sharif-afghanistan-consular-affairs/ |website=Ministry of Foreign Affairs Government of Pakistan}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Consulates: Mazar-e-Sharif |url=https://eoi.gov.in/kabul/?0350?000 |website=Embassies of India}}</ref>

==Main sights==
The modern city of Mazar-i Sharif is centred around the Shrine of Ali. Much restored, it is one of Afghanistan's most glorious monuments. Outside Mazar-i Sharif lies the ancient city of [[Balkh]]. The city is a centre for the traditional [[buzkashi]] sport, and the [[Hazrat Ali Mazar|Blue Mosque]] is the focus of northern Afghanistan's [[Nowruz]] celebration. Although most Muslims believe that the real grave of [[Ali]] is found within [[Imam Ali Shrine|Imam Ali Mosque]] in [[Najaf]], [[Iraq]], others still come to Mazar-i-Sharif to pay respect.
