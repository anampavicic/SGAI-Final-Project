'''Roorkee''' (Rūṛkī; {{IPA|hi|ɾuːɽkiː|lang}}) is a city and a [[Municipal Corporations in India|municipal corporation]] in the [[Haridwar district]] of the state of [[Uttarakhand]], India. It is {{cvt|31|km}} from [[Haridwar|Haridwar city]], the district headquarter. It is spread over a flat terrain under [[Sivalik Hills]] of [[Himalayas]]. The city is developed on the banks of [[Ganges Canal]], its dominant feature, which flows from north–south through middle of the city. Roorkee is home to Asia's first engineering college [[Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee]], formerly known as Thomson College of Civil Engineering. Roorkee is also known for the [[Roorkee Cantonment]], one of the country's oldest military establishments and the headquarters of [[Bengal Engineer Group]] since 1853.<ref>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20081124/dplus1.htm "Bengal Sappers’ saga of valour"], ''[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]],'' 24 November 2008.</ref> A freight train ran in between Roorkee and [[Piran Kaliyar]] on 22 December 1851, this was two years before first passenger trains were started between Bombay and Thana in 1853 and 14 years after first freight trains ran in Chennai in 1837.<ref name="ReferenceA">irfca.org/docs/history/india-first-railways.html</ref>

==History==
[[File: Ganges canal roorkee1860.jpg|thumb|left|Ganga canal, 1860.]]
Roorkee is listed in the [[Ain-i-Akbari]] as a [[pargana]] under the [[sarkar (country subdivision)|sarkar]] of [[Saharanpur]], producing a revenue of 12,234 [[dam (Indian coin)|dam]]s for the imperial treasury and supplying a force of 1200 infantry and 125 cavalry.<ref name="Ain-i-Akbari">{{cite book |author=Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak |translator-last=Jarrett |translator-first=Henry Sullivan |title=The Ain-i-Akbari |date=1891 |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bengal |location=Calcutta |page=292 |url=https://archive.org/details/ainiakbarivolum00mubgoog |access-date=21 January 2021}}</ref>
After that it was a part of [[Landhaura]] princely state till 1824 when the Britishers occupied it.<ref name="cite">{{cite web |url = https://roorkee.cantt.gov.in/history/ |title = Roorkee Cantonment Board - History |access-date = 2 September 2021 }}</ref>

Before 1840, the city was a tiny hamlet consisting of mud huts on the banks of the Solani rivulet.<ref name=roor>[https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V21_331.gif Roorkee Town2], ''[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]]'', v. 21, ''p. 325.''</ref> Digging work on the [[Ganges Canal|Upper Ganges Canal]] formally began in April 1842, under the aegis of [[Proby Cautley]], a British officer.

Col. P.T. Cautley, an officer in the British Army, was most instrumental in constructing the canal. According to Dept. of Hydrology the canal, which is still considered as a marvel of engineering, was built in 1853. However, water was released in the canal on 8 April 1854.

To look after the maintenance of the canal, the Canal Workshop and Iron Foundry were established in 1843 on the civil lines on the canal bank which is known as the Irrigation workshop nowadays. This was followed by the establishment of Civil Engineering School; classes started in 1845<ref name=roor/> to train local youth to assist in the civil-engineering work of the Upper Ganges Canal.<ref>[https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V04_350.gif Indian Engineering Colleges], ''[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]]'', 1909, v. 4, p. 321.</ref> This was to become the first engineering college established in India.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Military Engineer, Vol II |last=Sandes |first=Lt Col E.W.C. |year=1935 |publisher=Institution of Royal Engineers |location=Chatham |page=358 <!--|no-pp=368-->|url=http://dspace.gipe.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10973/37244}}</ref> On 25 November 1847, the college was formally constituted through a proposal by the Sir James Thomason, Lt. Governor of North-Western Province (1843–53).<ref name=roor/> After his death in 1853, the college was rechristened as Thomason College of Civil Engineering. The college later upgraded to [[University of Roorkee]] in 1949; on 21 September 2001, through an Act of parliament, it was made one of the [[Indian Institutes of Technology]], [[IIT Roorkee]].<ref name=IIT>[http://www.iitr.ac.in/ IIT Roorkee] Official website.</ref> In 1853 Bengal Sappers and Miners were stationed here which provided a controlling influence during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|1857 uprising]]. Other important events in the history of Roorkee include that under the Post Office Act of 1866, it was among the first few towns to have a post office and first telegraph office in the district. Now Roorkee has a General Post Office (GPO) and a number of post offices located in Roorkee City and Cantt. In 1886, Roorkee was placed on the Railway map of India. In 1907, first provincial trunk road Meerut-Roorkee-Dehradun was constructed. In 1920, Roorkee became the first town in [[Uttar Pradesh]] to have [[hydroelectricity]].
[[File:Solani Aquaduct Of Ganges Canal.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Solani aqueduct|Solani Aqueduct]] Of [[Ganges Canal]]]]
India's first aqueduct was constructed over the Solani river, near Roorkee, part of the [[Ganges Canal]] project, which itself was India's first irrigation work in North India, started by the British.<ref>[https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V03_376.gif Irrigation and Navigation] [[Imperial Gazetteer of India]], 1909 v. 3, p. 341.</ref> In 1851, the Solani Aqueduct Railway was built by Proby Cautley in Roorkee to transport construction materials for Ganges canal. It was operated by the [[Bengal Sappers]]. A steam engine, ''Jenny Lind'', (specially shipped from England moved on rails in India), pulling a freight train ran in Roorkee on 22 December 1851, between Roorkee and [[Piran Kaliyar]], {{cvt|10|km}} from the city, two years before first passenger trains were started between [[Mumbai|Bombay]] and Thana in 1853 and 14 years after first freight trains ran in Chennai in 1837.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> A replica of what the locomotive is thought to have looked like is exhibited at Roorkee Railway Station.

The municipality of Roorkee was created in 1868.<ref name=roor/> Now it is a Municipal Corporation. It had been home to the [[Bengal Sappers and Miners]] since 1853, and two artillery units were stationed there.<ref name=roor/> Today, the [[Roorkee Cantonment]] has a large army base. The [[Bengal Engineer Group|Bengal Engineering Group and Centre]] (BEG&C), are still there today.

In 1901, when the city had a population of 17,197, it was made the headquarters of the Roorkee [[Tehsil]], in [[Saharanpur]] district of the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Province]] of the [[British Raj]]; the tehsil included in it 426 villages (of the ''parganas'' of Jwalapur, [[Manglaur]] and Bhagwanpur) and six towns, the most important among them being [[Haridwar]] and [[Manglaur]].<ref name=gaze/> The Old Cemetery in the city is a protected monument, by the [[Archaeological Survey of India]].<ref>[http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_alphalist_uttranchal.asp Alphabetical List of Monuments – Uttarakhand] ''[[Archaeological Survey of India]]'' website.</ref>

The city is located in the Roorkee plain which is composed of recent alluvium with a gentle slope. As per the census 2011, this region is spread over {{cvt|129.88|km2}}.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Census of India- 2011, District census handbook-Hardwar- Village and town directory|url=https://censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/0513_PART_A_DCHB_HARDWAR.pdf|access-date=15 September 2020|website=Office of the Registrar General & Census Commissioner, India}}</ref>

==Climate==
Roorkee has a monsoon-influenced [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cwa''), typical of the northern Indo-Gangetic plain. There are three seasons. A sweltering, dry “hot” season begins in mid-March and extends until mid-June with steadily increasing humidity and discomfort. From mid-June until the end of September the southwest monsoon gives the “wet” season with a total of around {{convert|770|mm|in|0}} of rainfall or about-four-fifths of the annual total. This monsoonal rain is accompanied by hot temperatures, very warm mornings, and extremely uncomfortable humidity. From early October the “cool” season begins as the monsoon retreats, featuring warm to very warm afternoons, cool mornings, and moderate humidity. Occasionally western disturbances between January and March will bring a little rainfall during this season, although the average total from October to March is only {{convert|145|mm|in|1|disp=or}}.
