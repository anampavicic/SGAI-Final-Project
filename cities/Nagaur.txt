== History ==
[[File:Above-Maharaja-Bakhat-Singh-at-the-Jharokha-Window-of-the-Bakhat-Singh-Mahal- 59024 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Maharaja Bakht Singh at the Jharokha window of the [[Bakhat Singh Mahal]], [[Nagaur]]]]
The Nagaur Fort was built by Maharaja of [[Parmar (Rajput clan)|Parmar]] [[Rajput|Rajputs]], and historically important to  [[Kshatriya|Kshatriyas]] of India. Naagvanshi Kshatriya took shelter around Nagaur.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nagaur.nic.in/ |title=Nagaur (Rajasthan) |access-date=2008-01-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203231308/http://www.nagaur.nic.in/ |archive-date=3 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The [[Parmar (Rajput clan)|Parmar]] [[Rajput|Rajputs]] rulers dominated Nagaur for a long period of time. [[Parmar (Rajput clan)|Parmar]] [[Rajput|Rajputs]] ruler of Nagaur were appreciated by Sisodias of [[Chittor]] and [[Rathore dynasty|Rathore]] of [[Jodhpur]]. The ancient name of the city was '''Ahichhatrapur.'''

In the medieval era, the town of Nagaur sat astride trade routes coming north from [[Gujarat]] and [[Sindh]] and those on the west crossing the Indus from [[Multan]] with a dead flat plain all around. The defence of the fort depended on the military and economic power of its rulers. And from the period of the [[Ghaznavid]] invasions, Nagaur was under the powerful Chauhan clan. A succession of rulers kept the whole of [[Jangladesh]] free from foreign rule down to the reign of [[Prithviraj Chauhan]] at the close of the 12th century. That Nagaur town came under the invaders is clear since [[Balban]], before becoming Sultan, was given an estate centered on this desert town. But just as there were petty [[Hindu]] chiefs (of numerous castes) in the vast lands between [[Ajmer]] and [[Delhi]], it is reasonable to suppose that such landholders were also present in the lands between [[Ajmer]] and Nagaur, paying land revenue to the Muslims and probably joining their army.

Another similarity between [[Ajmer]] and Nagaur is the early founding of [[Sufi]] shrines at both places. One of the earliest Sufis to come to Nagaur was Sultan Tarkin, whose shrine was established during Hindu rule. After [[Khwaja]] [[Moinuddin]] established the Chishti [[Sufi]] order at [[Ajmer]] one of his disciples, named Hamiduddin, came to Nagaur. Hamiduddin accommodated some Hindu principles in his teachings—he became a strict [[vegetarian]] and lovingly reared a cow in his shrine.

In 1391, during the reign of [[Nasir ud din Muhammad Shah III|Násir-ud-dín Muhammad Tughlak]], Jalal Khan Khokhar was assigned governor of Nagaur.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IARuAAAAMAAJ&q=jalal+khokhar |author= Rana Khan |title= The Rajputs History, Clans, Culture, and Nobility · Volume 1|page=262 |date=2005 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Saran |first=Richard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=plP7DwAAQBAJ&q=khokhar |title=The Mertiyo Rathors of Merto, Rajasthan: Select Translations Bearing on the History of a Rajput Family, 1462–1660, Volumes 1–2 |last2=Ziegler |first2=Norman P. |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year= |isbn=978-0-472-03821-3 |pages=219 |language=en}}</ref> Between 1405-07, Shams Khan, brother of [[Muzaffar Shah I]] founded the Nagaur principality <ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bbTXAAAAMAAJ&q=According+to+him+,+his+caste+was+Khatri+but+he+was+expelled+from+his+caste+for+his |title=Islam and Muslims in South Asia: Historical Perspective |author=Iqtidar Husain Siddiqi |date=1987 |page=27 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Campbell |first=James Macnabb |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/54652/54652-h/54652-h.htm |title=History of Gujarát.

Following [[Battle of Nagaur|the defeat of combined armies]] of Shams Khan and the [[Gujarat Sultanate]] at the hands of the powerful Rajput ruler [[Kumbha of Mewar|Rana Kumbha]] in 1455, the town and nearby areas subsequently fell under the dominion of the [[Sisodia dynasty|Sisodiya]] Rajput rulers of [[Mewar]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Chandra |first=Satish |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L5eFzeyjBTQC |title=Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals-Delhi Sultanat (1206-1526) - Part One |date=2004 |publisher=Har-Anand Publications |isbn=978-81-241-1064-5 |page=223 |language=en}}</ref> 

During the Mughal reign in the 17th century, [[Amar Singh Rathore]] (30 December 1613 – 25 July 1644) was made the emperor's representative (subedar) of Nagaur.<ref name="ref70yecej">{{Citation | title=Casting kings: bards and Indian modernity | author=Jeffrey G.

Most of the palatial structures inside the fort were built by [[Bakht Singh of Marwar]]. Bakht Singh was made the lord of Nagaur by his elder brother Abhai Singh of Jodhpur. As the lord of Nagaur, Bakht invaded Bikaner and fought Jaipur at the [[Battle of Gangwana]].<ref>Munis pp. 316</ref>

In 1755 [[Jayappaji Rao Scindia|Jai Appa Sindhia]] attacked on Nagaur after looting several places in Rajasthan. Jai Appa halted his army near Samas pond of Tausar which was 3.5 Km from Nagaur fort. He surrounded Nagaur fort and cut off food and water supply. Maharaja Vijay Singh ji called the Darbar and asked volunteers to kill Scindia. Gaji Khan Khokhar (Chawata Kallan) and Kan Singh (Dotalai) volunteered and took responsibility to kill Jai Appa Scindia. Both changed their outfit as traders and opened shop near Jai Appaji's army. They observed their activities for two months. On Friday, 25 July 1755 at 11 am, they attacked Jai Appa with daggers and killed him. While fighting, both the loyal soldiers of Jodhpur were martyred. From then on, a common proverb that people still say: "Khokhar bada khuraki; kha gaya appa jaisa daaki" (Khokhar are very voracious, eaten demon like appa).
Even after killing of Jai Appa Sindhia, Maratha army continued fighting for few more months near Nagaur but they eventually retreated.
