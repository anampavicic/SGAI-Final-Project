The name in [[Oirat language|Oirat]] [[clear script]] is {{MongolUnicode|ᡄᠯᡄᠰᡉᡐᡉ}} or {{MongolUnicode|ᠡᠯᠡᠡᠰᠦᠲᠦ}}, ''Êlêsütü''</ref> is the [[capital city]] of the [[Kalmykia|Republic of Kalmykia]], [[Russia]].

It was known as '''Stepnoy''' (Степно́й) from 1944 to 1957.

==History==
[[File:Buddha Kalmykia.JPG|left|thumb|A representation of the Buddha]]

Elista was founded in 1865 as a small settlement, the name is from [[Kalmyk language|Kalmyk]] ''els(e)n'' 'sand(y)'.<ref name="Pospelov">Е. М. Поспелов. "Географические названия мира", Москва, 1998, стр.&nbsp;480.</ref> In November 1920, Elista became the [[administrative center]] of the [[Kalmyk Autonomous Oblast]]. By the early 1930s, Elista was transformed into a small city as the [[collectivization]] policies of [[Joseph Stalin]] forced many [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyks]] to abandon their traditional pastoral nomadic lifestyle in exchange for a modern, sedentary, and urban lifestyle. In October 1935, Elista was recognized as the capital of the [[Kalmyk ASSR]].
In late 1942, the city was briefly occupied by the [[Nazi Germany|German]] army. Because of alleged [[collaboration]] between the ethnic Kalmyks and the Germans, on December&nbsp;27, 1943, the Kalmyk ASSR was dissolved and its ethnic Kalmyk residents were forcibly [[Kalmyk deportations of 1944|exiled to Siberia]]. Russian people were brought in to repopulate Elista, whose name was changed to '''Stepnoy''' ({{lang|ru|Степно́й}}). It was called Stepnoy until 1957, when the survivors of the deportations were allowed to return from exile.

Some western tourists started to visit Elista from the mid-1990s, and more after it received publicity as the host city of the 1998 [[Chess Olympiad]]. The city is safe and has little traffic. On the outskirts of Elista, there are vast grasslands.

==Geography==
The city is located in the area of the [[Yergeni]] hills, in the upper part of the [[Elista (river)|Elista]] valley. The sources of the river are located in the western part of the city. The Elista crosses the urban area from west to east, dividing it into two sections, a larger northern part and a smaller southern one.<ref name="GE">[[Google Earth]]</ref>

===Climate===
<!-- continental as opposed to semi-arid due to the threshold being 9.3 * 20 and then + 140 = 326 mm and Elista getting 349 mm.-->
Elista has a hot-summer [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfa''), although it has sometimes been described as a [[semi-arid climate|temperate semi-arid climate]] (Köppen classification ''BSk'').<ref name= koppen>{{cite journal| last = Kottek | first = M.|author2=J.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Elista is the [[capital city|capital]] of the republic. Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is, together with four rural localities, incorporated as the '''[[City of federal subject significance|City]] of Elista'''—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of the Republic of Kalmykia|districts]].<ref name="Ref56">Appendix to Decree #137</ref> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the City of Elista is incorporated as '''Elista Urban Okrug'''.<ref name="Ref728">Law #308-IV-Z</ref>

==Features==
[[File:Statue of the Old White Man.jpg|thumb|left|A Kalmyk woman praying in front of the statue before entering the temple]]

Since 1991, the town has been characterized by the slow decay of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-built institutions, and the large construction projects instigated by the republic's millionaire president [[Kirsan Ilyumzhinov]].

The town center has a number of renovated public parks focused on the main square, boasting statues to both [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. To the east of the town lies the Olympic village of the 1998 XXXIII [[Chess Olympiad]], known locally as "[[Chess City|City-Chess]]". The site has a public swimming pool and a museum of Kalmyk [[Buddhist art]], which is also infrequently used as a conference center.

During his visit in 1998, [[Tenzin Gyatso|the 14th Dalai Lama]] chose a location west of the town center to build the [[Burkhan Bakshin Altan Sume]], a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple for city residents. It was opened in December 2005. It is the largest Buddhist temple in Europe.

==Transportation==
Elista has a [[Elista Airport|small regional airport]] which is open daily during the week, providing flights to [[Moscow]] and various cities in the southern part of the Russian Federation. The airport was closed by the federal aviation authorities sometime in the fall of 2006,{{Why|date=February 2014}} but was reopened sometime in 2007. Rail connections are available to [[Stavropol]].

Due to the high cost of air travel, people usually prefer to take the bus between Elista and Moscow. The trip is approximately 18 hours and makes several rest stops along the route. Nowadays there is an airline, Azimuth, that provides air flights to Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Sochi, Crimea and Rostov on Don at affordable cost with direct flights from Elista airport. The price starts at 2500 rubles one way and it saves traveler a lot of time instead of traveling by bus as it was in the past.

Within Elista itself, a network of about a dozen ''[[marshrutka]]'' (minibus) routes is run by private companies.{{Why|date=February 2014}} Minibuses are available around every five minutes. This is the preferred option of most Kalmykians because of the minimal cost (10 [[Russian ruble|rubles]]).
