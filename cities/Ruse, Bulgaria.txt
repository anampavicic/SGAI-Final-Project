'''Ruse''' (also transliterated as '''Rousse''', '''Russe'''; {{langx|bg|Русе}} {{IPA|bg|ˈrusɛ|}}) is the [[List of cities and towns in Bulgaria|fifth largest city]] in [[Bulgaria]]. Ruse is in the northeastern part of the country, on the right bank of the [[Danube]], opposite the Romanian city of [[Giurgiu]], approximately {{convert|67|km|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]]'s capital, {{convert|172|km|0|abbr=on}} from [[Varna, Bulgaria|Varna]], and {{convert|249|km|0|abbr=on}} from the capital [[Sofia]]. Thanks to its location and its railway and road bridge over the [[Danube]] ([[Danube Bridge]]), it is the most significant Bulgarian river port, serving an important part of the international trade of the country. It is the 12th largest of all [[List of cities and towns on the Danube river|cities on the Danube river]].

Ruse is known for its 19th- and 20th-century [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-Baroque]] and [[Rococo Revival|Neo-Rococo]] architecture, which attracts many tourists. It is often called the [[Vienna|Little Vienna]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bnr.bg/RadioBulgaria/Emission_English/Theme_Bulgaria_And_The_World/Material/neigbourly1201.htm |title=Neighborly: Balkan developments |last=Martinov |first=Krassimir |author2=Daniela Konstantinova |date=2007-01-12 |publisher=[[Radio Bulgaria]] |access-date=2008-12-27|quote=...

Ruse is the birthplace of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureate in Literature]] [[Elias Canetti]] and the writer [[Michael Arlen]].

Ruse is on the right bank of the river Danube, which is the high bank, having two underwater terraces and three [[river terrace]]s at {{convert|15|to(-)|22|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}, {{convert|30|to(-)|66|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}, and {{convert|54|to(-)|65|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}. The average altitude is {{convert|45.5|m|2|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|AMSL]]. The urban area is an approximately 11-km ellipse running along the river. The city extends from the land-connected Matey ({{lang|bg|Матей}}) island and the mouth of [[Rusenski Lom]] on the west to Srabcheto ({{lang|bg|Сръбчето}}) hill on the east. During the 20th century, the west end of the city was significantly modified by moving the mouth of [[Rusenski Lom]] to the west, as well as by moving the bank itself with its fairway considerably to the north. Sarabair ({{lang|bg|саръбаир}}, from Turkish {{lang|tr|Sarıbayır}} meaning "Yellow Slope") hill is to the south of the city and is {{convert|159|m|2|abbr=on}} high. The [[Rousse TV Tower]] is built there on the remains of Leventtabia, a former Turkish fortification.

==Geography==
Ruse is located in the northeastern part of the country, on the right bank of the [[Danube]], opposite the Romanian city of [[Giurgiu]], approximately 75 km (47 mi) south of [[Bucharest]], Romania's capital, 200 km (124 mi) from the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, and 300 km (186 mi) from the capital [[Sofia]].

== History ==
[[File:Rousse-Roman-inscription.JPG|left|thumb|250px|An inscription from the Sexaginta Prista fortress]]

=== Etymology ===
Scholars suggest that the city on the river bank derived its present name from the Finnish root ''ruskea'' meaning "blonde", or ''*ru-'' ("river", "stream") or from the [[Cherven (fortress)|Cherven fortress]], meaning "red," through the root ''rous'', which is present in many [[Slavic languages]].

A popular legend claims that the name ''Ruse'' comes from Finnish ruskea, or the name of a female founder of the city, whose name was Rusa, meaning "blonde hair". In the 13th and 14th centuries, during the time of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], a fortified settlement called ''Rusi'', first mentioned in 1380, emerged near the ruins of the earlier Roman town.

Other theories include settlement by people from the [[Rus' people|Rus]] era; a connection to the village of [[Rusokastro]] in Burgas Province; an unattested tribe of [[Getae]] with a name such as ''Riusi'', or; the pagan festival of [[Rosalia (festival)|Rosalia]].<ref name=rousse>{{cite web |url=http://www.museumruse.com/rusehistory/rusename_bg.htm |title=История на Русе |publisher=Регионален исторически музей{{mdash}}Русе |language=bg |access-date=2008-09-14 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080610180850/http://www.museumruse.com/rusehistory/rusename_bg.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2008-06-10}}</ref>

=== Antiquity ===
The city emerged from a [[Neolithic]] settlement of the [[3rd millennium BC|3rd]] to 2nd millennium BCE, when pottery, fishing, agriculture, and hunting developed. Excavations have revealed several layers, suggesting that the place was attacked by neighbouring tribes and suffered from natural disasters. Ancient sanctuaries were found nearby, where idols of a pregnant woman, a fertility goddess, were prevalent.

The later [[Thracians|Thracian]] settlement developed into a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] military and naval centre during the reign of [[Vespasian]] (69–70 CE), as part of ''[[Limes Moesiae]]'', the fortification system along the northern boundary of [[Moesia]]. Its name, ''Sexaginta Prista'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bulgarian-monuments.com/view/Roman_fortress_Sexaginta_Prista|title=Bulgarian Monuments – Roman fortress Sexaginta Prista|access-date=23 June 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623230945/http://www.bulgarian-monuments.com/view/Roman_fortress_Sexaginta_Prista|archive-date=23 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> suggests a meaning of "a city of 60 ships" (from {{langx|la|sexaginta}}&nbsp;— "60" and {{langx|el|script=latn|pristis}}&nbsp;— a special type of guard ship), based on the supposed 60 nearby [[Berth (moorings)|berths]].

The fort was on the main road between [[Singidunum]] (modern [[Belgrade]]) and the [[Danube Delta]] and was destroyed in the 6th century by [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] raids. [[Hungary|Hungarian]] historian [[Felix Philipp Kanitz]] was the first to identify Sexaginta Prista with Ruse, but the Škorpil brothers demonstrated the link later through studying inscriptions, coins, graves, and objects of daily life. An inscription from the reign of [[Diocletian]] proves that the city was rebuilt as a ''praesidium'' (a large fortification) after it was destroyed by the [[Goths]] in 250 CE.

The settlement was mentioned as ''Golyamo Yorgovo'' in the Middle Ages, whose present successor is [[Giurgiu]] in [[Romania]].

=== Ottoman rule ===
[[File:Rousse panoramic 1824.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of Ruse in 1824]]

During [[History of Ottoman Bulgaria|Ottoman rule]], the invaders destroyed the town, reacting to a 1595 unsuccessful liberation attempt by a joint [[Vlach]]-Bulgarian army, led by [[Michael the Brave]]. After its rebuilding in the following years, Ruse was dubbed ''Rusçuk'' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]] for "little Ruse") and had again expanded into a large fortress by the 18th century. It later grew into one of the most important Ottoman towns on the Danube and an administrative centre of [[Tuna Vilayet]], which extended from [[Varna, Bulgaria|Varna]] and [[Tulcea]] to Sofia and [[Niš]].

The ''Dunav'' newspaper appeared — it was the first printed in Bulgaria and in Bulgarian. Some Bulgarian schools were founded. The streets are renamed and numbered for the first time in Bulgarian lands. A post office, hospital, home for the aged were founded. Three empires met here for trading: [[Austro-Hungary]], Russia, [[British Empire]]. France and Italy opened consulates in Ruse. The modern city arose from the shades of the settlement. In 1865 the Obraztsov Chiflik was founded on the place where the English Consul's farm was; it was the first modern farm on the territory of the whole [[Ottoman Empire]] of that time.

Ruse developed into a centre of the [[Bulgarian National Revival]] and hosted the headquarters of the [[Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee]].

=== Early Modern Bulgaria ===

After it became part of modern Bulgaria on 20 February 1878, Ruse was one of the key cultural and economic centres of the country. Intensive building during the period changed the city's architectural appearance to a typical [[Central Europe]]an one. Ruse is known for the many first innovations in Bulgaria, including:

[[File:Konsulstva-ruse.png|Official seals of foreign consulates in Ruse|thumb]]

Ruse had the first Bulgarian factories for soda water, lemonade, and for neckties.<ref>[http://lib.sudigital.org/record/470/files/Almanah%20PDF.pdf] "Mеждународен алманах за България 1898.

In the newly liberated Bulgaria of the late 19th century, Ruse was a cosmopolitan city with a multiethnic population. According to the first census conducted in 1883, ethnic Bulgarians made up 43% of the population, Turks 39%, and Jews 7%.

"All façades on main streets of Russe shall have rich decorations with plastic stone", postulate the Regulations for Constructions of Private Buildings of 1893, issued by the Municipality of Russe.

After [[Alexander, Prince of Bulgaria|knyaz Alexander Battenberg's]] 1886 [[History of Independent Bulgaria#Ferdinand|abdication]], and as a reaction to the regentship's course led by prime minister [[Stefan Stambolov]], a group of Russophile (pro-Russian) military officers revolted in Ruse. The riot was violently crushed, and 13 of the leaders were quickly sentenced to death and executed near the city, which caused much public discontent. Decades later, in 1934, local citizens raised funds and built a monument at the place where the Russophile officers were executed. The monument was blown up in 1940 but rebuilt in 1966 at approximately the same spot.

=== Early 20th century ===
* 1908 – The first factory for iron beds in Modern Bulgaria. Today Ruse is a major centre of furniture manufacturing.
* 1911 was marked off with the start of a project for an electrical station by "Siemens-Schukert". On 17 February 1917 Ruse became the third electrified city in the country (after Sofia and Varna).
* In 1913 Belgian entrepreneurs and engineers were granted a concession for a period of 25 years and built the largest sugar factory in Bulgaria.
[[File:Staroto-kazino.jpg|300px|thumb|The Municipal casino, Ruse – 1920]]
* 1927 – the first sock-making factory in Bulgaria opened in Ruse. "Fazan" still exists today;<ref>[http://www.fazansocks.com/_uk/company_en.htm] "Първата чорапена фабрика в България"</ref>
* 1933 – the first oil refinery was constructed;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.petrol.bg/history.php |title=Petrol |access-date=2011-07-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719012310/http://www.petrol.bg/history.php |archive-date=19 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Between World War I and [[World War II|II]], after [[Southern Dobruja]] was lost to Romania, the economic significance of the city decreased. So did the population: Ruse was no longer the second-largest city in Bulgaria (after former [[East Rumelia]]n capital [[Plovdiv]]), being quickly surpassed by [[Sofia]] and [[Varna, Bulgaria|Varna]]. Foreign consulates were closed, except for the Russian one, which remained functional until 2022. Only for the period between 1919 and 1920 the capital loss is estimated at around 40 million leva.

=== World War II period ===
{{See also|Ruse blood wedding}}
The return of Southern Dobrudja to Bulgaria in September 1940 fostered good conditions for the restoration of the city's leading role. It became a provincial centre, and economic activity revived. Typical for the post-war architecture of the city was the wide use of iron, concrete and glass as construction materials. Examples are the River port – 1931, the Freight station – 1935, Market Hall – 1939 and the Court house – 1940.

=== Communist period ===

The construction of the [[Giurgiu-Rousse Friendship Bridge|Ruse-Giurgiu bridge]] in 1954 and the fast industrialization gave a new push to development. Ruse emerged again as an important economic, transport, cultural, and education hub. Engineering, chemical, and light industries expanded; a large harbor was built, and the city became a university centre. At the 1985 census, a population of more than 186,000 was reported.

In the early 1980s, Ruse entered a dark period. The Verachim factory was built in Giurgiu, which polluted the air between 1980 and 1991, impacting the city's development. The population decreased, and 15,000 people moved out between 1985 and 1992. The first informal organization in Bulgaria under the communist regime was established here - The Public Committee for Environmental Protection of Ruse, which provoked the first nationwide demonstrations and strongly influenced the [[History of the People's Republic of Bulgaria#Fall of the Communist regime|change to democracy]]. In 1991, the Romanian factory ceased the pollution, after the fall of the communist regime in Romania.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bnr.bg/en/post/100565149/1987-public-protests-against-gassing-of-ruse-kick-off|title=1987: Public protests against gassing of Ruse kick off}}</ref>

=== Democratic Bulgaria ===

[[File:Rousse University Kaneff Centre 01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Kaneff center]]

Like other post-socialist regimes in eastern Europe, Bulgaria found the transition to capitalism rather painful and not as easy as expected. State-owned enterprises lost their former markets and could not adapt to the now free-market competition. This led to massive unemployment in the city and emigration waves in the 90s. Since 2000, Ruse has been continually regaining its former leading status. The urban economics were positively influenced by the [[2007 enlargement of the European Union|2007's accession of Bulgaria and Romania in the European Union]], which allowed deeper cross-border cooperation. The flow of investments through EU funds restarted long suspended projects which were finally completed.

After decades of construction, the new corpus of the [[University of Ruse]] was inaugurated in 2010.

In 2011 the city's centre was renovated through an EU project, worth 10 million leva. Included in the project, a Dry Deck Fountain was introduced in an urban environment for the first time in Bulgaria. The exterior of the [[Rousse State Opera]] was reconditioned.

A water treatment facility, an investment worth 57 million Euro, is now functional.

In 2012 the [[Rousse Regional Historical Museum]] completed a project, which allowed the rehabilitation and display of the remains of the Roman city Sexaginta Prista.

[[Ignat Kaneff]], a Bulgarian-born Canadian business magnate, endowed about half of the amount necessary for the construction of a modern conference complex named after him, the Kaneff Centre, at the [[University of Ruse]]. It was officially opened on 10 October 2013.

A landmark event for the city was the opening of the new Eco Museum & Aquarium in 2014.

A safer and more efficient navigation in the inland waterways was accomplished with a new structure – the river information system BulRIS. A modern oncology centre is now operating.

Ruse was a candidate for a [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2019<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ruse2019.eu/|title=Singel Dejting|website=ruse2019.eu|access-date=21 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218232255/http://www.ruse2019.eu/|archive-date=18 February 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> with the concept "Free spirit city".

[[Dohodno zdanie]], an imposing Neoclassical edifice in the city centre convincingly won the National competition "Emblematic building of the year" in 2014. Ruse was a host city of the first of its kind in Bulgaria – an International Ice Figures Festival.

The [[Arena Ruse]] sports hall with more than 5100 seats opened on 23 July 2015 nearly 40 years after initial construction efforts began. The project was suspended on numerous occasions due to a lack of financing. An underground parking inside the sports hall has also been completed.

On-going projects are the re-cultivation of the old landfill, worth 22,5 million leva. The biggest roundabout in the city with underpasses for pedestrians and cyclists, worth some 10 million leva was reconstructed.

Ruse is a major road and railway hub in Northern Bulgaria. Railway transportation in the city dates back to 1867 when it became a station of the first railway line in Bulgaria Ruse – Varna. There are railways to Southern Bulgaria, [[Sofia]], Varna and [[Bucharest]]. Ruse has two railway stations for passenger services ([[Ruse Central railway station|Ruse Central]] and Ruse Razpredelitelna) and two for freight transport services. There are intercity buses that link Ruse with cities and towns all over the country, as well as in other European nations. They are based in two bus stations: South and East.

Ruse has an extensive public transport system with 25 [[bus]] and [[trolleybus]] lines, including the [[Trolleybuses in Ruse|Ruse trolleybus system]]. Since the sale of all shares of the private Israeli transport holding Egged Ruse to the local municipality in 2017, trolleybus lines have been operated by the city's own public transport entity. Since July 2024, urban bus lines are also operated by the municipal public transport entity. Suburban bus lines remain under concession to various private Bulgarian transport companies. A 14 kilometer bicycle network along the main boulevards of the city has been developed and is currently in the process of expansion.

Approximately {{convert|17|km|0|abbr=off}} southeast of Ruse is the village of [[Shtraklevo]], near which is the former military and passenger [[Ruse Airport]]. It is owned by the municipality of Ruse, with an active license for small passenger and cargo flights (license issued on 21.12.2016).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnevnik.bg/biznes/2016/12/21/2887562_malki_samoleti_veche_shte_mogat_da_kacat_na_letishte/|title=Малки самолети вече ще могат да кацат на летище "Русе"|date=21 December 2016 }}</ref> The runway is long enough for [[Boeing 747]]s (Jumbo Jets). The [[Henri Coandă International Airport]] in [[Otopeni]], Romania is {{convert|80|km|abbr=off}} north of Ruse.

The [[Danube Bridge|Danube bridge]] is located east of Ruse. It was the only road and rail bridge between Bulgaria and Romania until the opening of a second bridge crossing to Romania on 14 June 2013 at [[Vidin]].

Ruse is the biggest Bulgarian port on the banks of the Danube River. After the opening of the [[Rhine–Main–Danube Canal]] which covers {{convert|3500|km|0|abbr=on}} and connects 13 European countries with Asia via the Black Sea, the river becomes the longest inland waterway on the planet. This key position has determined the 19th century-long co-existence of different cultures and religions in Ruse.

== Education ==
There is one university in Ruse – "Angel Kanchev" [[University of Ruse]] with a capacity of 15 000 students. The university's structure includes a subsidiaries in [[Silistra]], [[Vidin]] and [[Razgrad]]. There is also a subsidiary of the College of Agriculture – Plovdiv in the city.

The city hosts 26 high schools, among which is the [[English Language School "Geo Milev" (Ruse)|English Language School "Geo Milev"]].
