==Etymology==
San Carlos, formerly known as ''Binalatongan'', experienced significant historical events that influenced its name change. In 1660, a revolt led by Andres Malong, and later another insurrection in 1762 headed by Juan dela Cruz Palaris, culminated in humiliating defeats for the Spanish colonial forces. These uprisings prompted King Carlos III of Spain to order the destruction of ''Binalatongan''. Following this directive, the town was razed and subsequently renamed San Carlos, which remains its name today. The renaming served both as a punitive measure and as a means to establish a new order in the aftermath of the rebellions.<ref>{{Cite web |title=San Carlos City |url=https://www.pangasinan.gov.ph/city-municipalities/san-carlos-city/ |access-date=June 4, 2024 |website=Province of Pangasinan Official Website}}</ref>

==History==

[[File:Lunsod ng San Carlos NHCP Historical Marker.jpg|thumb|left|National historical marker installed at the city plaza in 1988]]

===Spanish colonial era===

====Origins====
{{see also|Caboloan}}
San Carlos, originally known as ''Binalatongan'', was inhabited by the San Carlenians, who were of [[Malay race|Malayan]] race. They spoke [[Caboloan|Cabuloan]], the original [[Pangasinan]] dialect. The San Carlenians were known for their staunch adherence to their beliefs and practices, leading to frequent conflicts with the Augustinian friars. These clashes ultimately forced the Augustinians to abandon the area. However, the Dominicans later succeeded where the Augustinians had failed, establishing San Carlos as a Christian community.

The town's history is marked by significant uprisings led by prominent local figures. Andres Malong and [[Juan dela Cruz Palaris]] are two of the most notable leaders. Palaris, whose real name was Pantaleon Perez, earned his moniker due to his agility and skill in native fencing, known as "eskrima de mano." He spearheaded a revolt against the Spanish authorities in 1762, which lasted for two years and spread across [[Pangasinan]]. His resistance against excessive tribute and forced labor led to the establishment of an independent government based in ''Binalatongan''.

====Revolts====
The first significant revolt in the area occurred in 1660, led by Andres Malong. In 1718, during a minor uprising led by Juan Caragay, the church and its convent were set on fire, prompting the relocation of the Poblacion east of the San Juan River. This transfer occurred on November 4, 1718, coinciding with the feast of Saint Charles Borromeo, leading to the settlement being renamed San Carlos ''Binalatongan''.<ref>{{Cite web |date=August 9, 2015 |title=The Beautiful Place that is San Carlos, Pangasinan |url=https://triptheislands.com/off-the-beaten-path/the-beautiful-place-that-is-san-carlos-pangasinan/ |access-date=November 4, 2022 |website=triptheislands.com}}</ref>

====Royal degree and final renaming====
In 1763, during another revolt led by Juan dela Cruz Palaris, the convent and the church of Saint Dominic were once again set ablaze. This event led King Charles III of Spain to issue a decree relocating the site to a place then known as "Lucban." The town's major involvement in these uprisings resulted in a royal mandate to rename the town after the Spanish monarch, thus it was renamed San Carlos.

From its foundation until 1764, the Poblacion and the church were relocated several times within the town's present boundaries. The initial site was on the western bank of the Agno River near the Zambales Mountains, likely within the town of Aguilar. It was later moved to the eastern side of the river, within the present barangay Mabalbalino, where it remained through the second half of the 17th century.

The town's rich history of resistance and resilience is encapsulated in its evolution from ''Binalatongan'' to San Carlos, reflecting the enduring spirit of its inhabitants and their significant role in regional history.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History |url=https://www.sancarlospangasinan.gov.ph/history |access-date=June 4, 2024 |website=sancarlospangasinan.gov.ph}}</ref>

===Philippine independence===
During the 1960s, the Municipality of San Carlos divided into two precincts. In 1965, the smaller precinct became legally incorporated as the Municipality of [[Basista, Pangasinan|Basista]] by virtue of Republic Act No. 4866.<ref>{{cite web |title=Republic Act No. 4866 – An Act Declaring Basista, Province of Pangasinan, Created by Executive Order Numbered Four Hundred Forty-Six Dated September Five, Nineteen Hundred Sixty-One, as a Duly Constituted Municipality |url=http://laws.chanrobles.com/republicacts/49_republicacts.php?id=4870 |website=laws.chanrobles.com |publisher=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library |access-date=November 21, 2019 |date=May 8, 1967}}</ref>

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}

In 1966, the larger precinct became legally incorporated as San Carlos City by virtue of Republic Act No. 4487.<ref>{{cite web |title=Republic Act No. 4487 – An Act Creating the City of San Carlos in Pangasinan |url=http://laws.chanrobles.com/republicacts/45_republicacts.php?id=4491 |website=laws.chanrobles.com |publisher=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library |access-date=November 21, 2019 |date=June 19, 1965}}</ref>

===Contemporary===
On April 28, 2007, San Carlos City's former mayor Julian V. Resuello was assassinated during an event at the city's plaza. His own family was accused in this assassination. He later died after two days.<ref>{{cite news |author1=Myds Supnad |title=Cops identify gunman in killing of San Carlos mayor |url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2007/05/02/397069/cops-identify-gunman-killing-san-carlos-mayor |work=The Philippine Star|publisher=Philstar Global Corp. |access-date=November 21, 2019 |date=May 2, 2007}}</ref>

===Giant mango pie===
On April 26, 2011, 86 barangays in San Carlos baked a 100-square-meter mango pie — filling a gymnasium and setting the largest mango pie world record (400 sqm na mango pie, iniluto sa San Carlos City). Natives used 400 trays of mango pies (10 kilos each, P 400,000, in a 100-square-meter table and shared by more than 1,200).
