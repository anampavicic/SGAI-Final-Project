'''High Wycombe''', often referred to as '''Wycombe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɪ|k|əm}} {{respell|WIK|əm}}),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/high-wycombe?showCookiePolicy=true|title=High Wycombe|access-date=23 September 2014|publisher=Collins Dictionary|date=n.d.}}</ref> is a [[market town]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], England. Lying in the valley of the [[River Wye, Buckinghamshire|River Wye]] surrounded by the [[Chiltern Hills]], it is {{convert|29|mi|km|0}} west-northwest of [[Charing Cross]] in [[London]], {{convert|13|mi}} south-southeast of [[Aylesbury]], {{convert|23|mi}} southeast of [[Oxford]], {{convert|15|mi}} northeast of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] and {{convert|8|mi}} north of [[Maidenhead]].

According to the [[2021 United Kingdom census]], High Wycombe's built up area has a population of 127,856, making it the largest town in the ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire. The '''High Wycombe Urban Area''', the conurbation of which the town is the largest component, has a population of 140,684. Part of the urban area constitutes the [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] of [[Chepping Wycombe]], which had a population of 14,455 according to the 2001 census&nbsp;– this parish represents that part of the ancient parish of Chepping Wycombe which was outside the former [[municipal borough]] of Wycombe. There has been a market held in the High Street since at least the [[Middle Ages]]. The market is currently held on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitbuckinghamshire.org/article/high-wycombe|title=High Wycombe|website=High Wycombe - Visit Buckinghamshire}}</ref>

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:High Wycombe map1945.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A map of High Wycombe from 1945]]
[[File:High Wycombe Roman Villa.png|left|thumb|200x200px|Ruins of [[High Wycombe roman villa]]]]

The town once featured [[High Wycombe roman villa|a Roman villa]] (built 150–170 AD)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/bcc/swop/history.page |title=Brief history of High Wycombe |access-date=7 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525211409/http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/bcc/swop/history.page |archive-date=25 May 2011}}</ref> which has been excavated four times, most recently in 2002. [[Mosaic]]s and a bathhouse were unearthed at the site on what is now the Rye parkland.  The name Wycombe would appear to come from the river Wye and the old English word for a wooded valley, "[[combe]]", but according to the ''Oxford English Dictionary of Place-Names'' the name, which was first recorded in 799–802 as "Wichama", is more likely to be Old English "wic" and the plural of Old English "ham", and probably means "dwellings"; the name of the river was a late back-formation.<ref>Eilert Ekwall, 1960. ''The Concise Oxford English Dictionary of Place-Names''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0198691033}}.</ref> Wycombe appears in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' of 1086 and was noted for having six mills.

The existence of a settlement at High Wycombe was first documented as 'Wicumun' in 970. The parish church was consecrated by Wulfstan, the visiting [[Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester|Bishop of Worcester]], in 1086. The town was described as a borough from at least the 1180s, and built its first [[moot hall]] in 1226, with a market hall being built later in 1476.<ref name="buckscc1">{{cite web |url=http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/media/130564/high_wycombe_report.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222134003/http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/media/130564/high_wycombe_report.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 February 2014 |title=High Wycombe : Historic Town Assessment Report Draft |website=Buckscc.gov.uk |access-date=9 August 2016 }}</ref>

The 1841 census reports the population that year was 3,184.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge'' Vol.III, London, 1847, Charles Knight, p.899</ref>

===Trade and industrial development===
High Wycombe remained a mill town through Medieval and [[Tudor period|Tudor]] times, manufacturing [[lace]] and [[linen]] cloth. It was also a stopping point on the way from Oxford to London, with many travellers staying in the town's taverns and inns.<ref name="buckscc1"/>

The paper industry was notable in 17th and 18th century High Wycombe. The Wye's waters were rich in [[chalk]], and therefore ideal for bleaching pulp. The paper industry was soon overtaken by the cloth industry.

Wycombe's most famous industry, furniture (particularly [[Windsor chair]]s) took hold in the 19th century, with furniture factories setting up all over the town.<ref>{{cite web |title=High Wycombe Furniture Trade History |date=16 May 2022 |url=https://www.gbfoamdirect.co.uk/high-wycombe-furniture-trade-history/ |access-date=17 May 2022}}</ref> Many terraced workers' houses were built to the east and west of town to accommodate those working in the furniture factories. In 1875, it was estimated that there were 4,700 chairs made per day in High Wycombe. When [[Queen Victoria]] visited the town in 1877, the council organised an arch of chairs to be erected over the High Street, with the words "Long live the Queen" printed boldly across the arch for the Queen to pass under. [[Wycombe Museum]] includes many examples of locally made chairs and information on the local furniture and lace industries.

The town's population grew from 13,000 residents in 1881 to 29,000 in 1928. Wycombe was completely dominated socially and economically by the furniture industry.

===20th century===
[[File:River Wye Wooburn.jpg|thumb|right|River Wye near [[Wooburn]] Industrial Estate]]
By the 1920s, many of the housing areas of Wycombe had decayed into slums. A [[Slum clearance in the United Kingdom|slum clearance]] scheme was initiated by the council in 1932, whereby many areas were completely demolished and the residents rehoused in new estates that sprawled above the town on the valley slopes.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Other Elizabeth Taylor|first=Nicola|last=Beauman|publisher=Persephone|year=2009|page=175|isbn=978-190-646210-9}}</ref> Some of the districts demolished were truly decrepit, such as Newland, where most of the houses were condemned as unfit for human habitation. However, some areas such as St. Mary's Street contained beautiful old buildings with fine examples of 18th and 19th century architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitoruk.com/HighWycombe/20th-century-T2208.html |title=Timeline History of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire |website=Visitoruk.com |access-date=9 August 2016}}</ref>

[[File:Former town hall, High Wycombe (geograph 3237429).jpg|thumb|The former [[High Wycombe Town Hall]] of 1904, now part of the [[Wycombe Swan]] theatre complex.]]
From 1940 to 1968 High Wycombe was the seat of the [[RAF Bomber Command]]. Moreover, during the [[Second World War]], from May 1942 to July 1945, the [[U.S. Army Air Force]]'s [[8th Air Force]] Bomber Command, codenamed "Pinetree", was based at a former girls' school at High Wycombe. This formally became Headquarters, 8th Air Force, on 22 February 1944.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barksdale.af.mil/8af/news/facts.doc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630001131/http://www.barksdale.af.mil/8af/news/facts.doc |archive-date=30 June 2006 |format=DOC |title=Eighth Air Force |access-date=9 August 2016}}</ref>

In the 1960s the town centre was redeveloped and many old buildings were demolished. The River Wye was culverted under concrete between 1965 and 1967 from  and demolishing most of the old buildings in Wycombe's town centre. Two shopping centres were built (the Octagon in 1970 and the Chilterns' in the 1980s) along with many new [[multi-storey car park]]s, office blocks, [[Overpass|flyovers]] and [[roundabout]]s.

==Modern-day High Wycombe==
High Wycombe comprises a number of suburbs including [[Booker, Buckinghamshire|Booker]], Bowerdean, Castlefield, Cressex, Daws Hill, Green Street, Holmers Farm, Micklefield, Sands, Terriers, Totteridge, [[Downley]] and [[Wycombe Marsh]], as well as some nearby villages: [[Hazlemere]] and [[Tylers Green]]. Particular areas in the suburbs of Castlefield, Micklefield, Terriers and Totteridge have high levels of deprivation compared to the rest of the urban area.

Although situated in the county of [[Buckinghamshire]], which is one of the most affluent parts of the country,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.local.communities.gov.uk/finance/1011/swg/SWG-09-04.pdf#page=23 |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227001349/http://www.local.communities.gov.uk/finance/1011/swg/SWG-09-04.pdf |archive-date=27 December 2013  }}</ref> Wycombe contains some considerably deprived areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wycombe.gov.uk/uploads/documents/Community%20and%20living/Fact%20File%2043_%20Deprivation%20Fact%20File.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325221211/http://www.wycombe.gov.uk/uploads/documents/Community%20and%20living/Fact%20File%2043_%20Deprivation%20Fact%20File.pdf |archive-date=25 March 2009 |title=Microsoft Word - Deprivation Fact File Final.doc |access-date=9 August 2016}}</ref>  In 2007, a [[GMB Union]] survey ranked the Wycombe district as the 4th dirtiest in the South East and the 26th dirtiest in the whole [[United Kingdom|UK]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/1559217.wycombe_shamed_in_league_table_of_filth/ |title=Wycombe shamed in league table of filth (From Bucks Free Press) |website=Bucksfreepress.co.uk |date=20 July 2007 |access-date=9 August 2016}}</ref><ref>[http://www.gmb.org.uk/shared_asp_files/GFSR.asp?NodeID=95748]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}</ref> The survey found litter on 28.5% of streets and highways. Data for the survey were taken from the Government's 2005/06 [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|Audit Commission]].

The town has undergone major redevelopment, including development of the town's existing shopping centre, completion of the  [[Eden, High Wycombe|Eden Shopping centre]], and redevelopment of the [[Buckinghamshire New University]] with a large student village and new building on Queen Alexandra Road.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buckinghamshire-new-university.learnhub.com/lesson/20670-accommodation-at-bucks-new |title=Accommodation at Bucks New - Buckinghamshire New University |access-date=13 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221231013/http://buckinghamshire-new-university.learnhub.com/lesson/20670-accommodation-at-bucks-new |archive-date=21 February 2014  }}</ref>

These developments prompted the building of larger blocks of flats, a multimillion-pound hotel in the centre, and a [[Sainsbury's]] store on the [[A40 road|Oxford road]] next to the Eden shopping centre and [[bus station]].

==Governance==
===Parliamentary constituency===
[[Wycombe (UK Parliament constituency)|Wycombe's political]] history extends back to 1295. The Wycombe Constituency had continuously elected [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Members of Parliament since 1951 until the Labour Party was voted in during the May 2024 general election. 

High Wycombe has been home to two [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|Prime Ministers]]:

* [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne]], who lived at what is now [[Wycombe Abbey]] and was MP for the town.
* [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who lived at nearby [[Hughenden Manor]], was defeated as a [[Radicals (UK)|Radical]] candidate for the seat three times in the 1830s but won election in 1868 and 1874–1876 as a Conservative. Disraeli made his first political speech in Wycombe, from the portico over the door of the Red Lion Hotel at 9–10 High Street.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1125159|desc=Red Lion Hotel, 9 and 10 High Street|fewer-links=yes}}</ref>

High Wycombe was also in the constituency represented by [[John Hampden]] (1594-1643), a leading MP and [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] commander who was killed in action during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]].

The town is represented by Labour MP Emma Reynolds.

The town until the 4th July 2024 General Election was represented by Conservative MP [[Steve Baker (politician)|Steve Baker]]. He was chairman of the eurosceptic [[European Research Group]] and was a junior minister in the [[Department for Exiting the European Union]] from 2017 to 2018. In July 2018, Baker resigned alongside Brexit Secretary [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] and Foreign Secretary [[Boris Johnson]] in opposition to the [[Chequers plan]] proposed by Prime Minister [[Theresa May]].

===Local government===
[[File:Wycombe Town Hall (geograph 2370429).jpg|thumb|[[Municipal Offices, High Wycombe|Municipal Offices]], Queen Victoria Road, opened 1932.]]
Since 2020, there has only been one tier of local government covering High Wycombe, being the unitary authority of [[Buckinghamshire Council]]. The former High Wycombe Borough Council was abolished in 1974. Instead of a town council, the councillors elected to Buckinghamshire Council to represent the unparished part of High Wycombe also act as [[charter trustees]], meeting to choose the town's [[Mayor of High Wycombe|mayor]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Mayor Making |website=Mayor and Charter Trustees of High Wycombe |url=https://www.mayorofhighwycombe.co.uk/mayor-making |access-date=25 February 2024}}</ref>

The [[ancient parish]] of Chepping Wycombe covered both the town of High Wycombe and a large rural area around it. To distinguish it from the neighbouring parish of [[West Wycombe]], the parish was historically known variously as East Wycombe, Great Wycombe, High Wycombe, Much Wiccomb,<ref name=EB1>{{citation |last= |first= |editor-last=Smellie |editor-first=William |editor-link=William Smellie |display-editors=0 |contribution=[[:s:Encyclopædia Britannica, First Edition/Chipping|Chipping]] |title=[[:s:EB1|Encyclopaedia Britannica]] |edition=1st |volume=II |date=1771 |location=Edinburgh |publisher=[[Colin Macfarquhar]] }}.</ref> Chipping,<ref name=EB1/> Chipping Wycombe, or Chepping Wycombe. The latter version eventually became the official name of parish, despite the town itself being more usually known as High Wycombe. The town does not appear to have been a [[ancient borough|borough]] at the time of the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086, but was being described as a borough by the 1180s. In the 1220s and 1230s there were disputes with the [[lord of the manor]], Alan Basset, as to the extent of the town's independence. These disputes were settled in favour of the town, with its borough rights being confirmed in 1237. Charters confirming the town's borough status were subsequently issued on a number of occasions.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Page |first1=William |title=A History of the County of Buckingham, Volume 3 |date=1925 |publisher=Victoria County History |location=London |pages=112–134 |url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/bucks/vol3/pp112-134 |access-date=3 June 2022}}</ref> As part of the general overhaul of ancient boroughs across the country under the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], the town became a [[municipal borough]] on 1 January 1836, under the name of Chepping Wycombe.<ref>{{cite book |title=Municipal Corporations Act 1835 |date=1835 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OetiAAAAcAAJ&dq=municipal+corporations+act+1835&pg=PA1 |access-date=3 June 2022}}</ref>

The borough only covered the built-up area of the town, rather than the whole parish. The borough council was therefore responsible for the secular elements of local government within its area, whereas the Chepping Wycombe parish [[vestry]] was responsible for secular matters in the part of the parish outside the borough, whilst being responsible for ecclesiastical matters across the whole parish, including the borough. In 1866, under the [[poor rate|Poor Law Amendment Act 1866]], the old parish of Chepping Wycombe was split into two civil parishes: one called "Wycombe" or "Wycombe Borough" which covered the area of Chepping Wycombe municipal borough, and another parish which retained the name "[[Chepping Wycombe]]" which covered the rural parts of the old parish outside the borough.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Youngs |first1=Frederic A. |title=Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Volume 1: Southern England |date=1979 |publisher=Royal Historical Society |location=London |page=43}}</ref>

By that time, the urban area was starting to expand beyond the old borough boundaries into the newly separated parish of Chepping Wycombe, particularly in the [[Wycombe Marsh]] area. To deal with growing urbanisation in its area, the parish of Chepping Wycombe was declared to be a [[local board of health|local government district]] in 1868, governed by a local board.<ref>{{cite news |title=Wycombe: Parish Local Board |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/ |access-date=2 June 2022 |work=Bucks Herald |date=7 March 1868 |location=Aylesbury |page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Local Government Act, 1858: Notice of Adoption of Act by the Parish of Chepping Wycombe, in the County of Bucks |journal=London Gazette |date=10 March 1868 |issue=23360 |page=1591 |url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/23360/page/1591 |access-date=3 June 2022}}</ref> The situation was partially simplified in 1880 when the local board was abolished and the borough boundaries were extended to cover the more built-up parts of Chepping Wycombe parish. The parish boundaries were not changed at the same time to match, making the Chepping Wycombe Borough Council responsible for all of the Wycombe parish area and part of the Chepping Wycombe parish area.<ref>{{cite book |title=Chepping Wycombe Borough Extension Act 1880 |date=1880 |publisher=H.M. Stationery Office |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=slw1AQAAMAAJ&dq=chepping+wycombe+borough+extension+1880&pg=RA14-PA3 |access-date=3 June 2022}}</ref>

When parish and district councils were established under the [[Local Government Act 1894]], it was stipulated that parishes could not straddle district boundaries. The Chepping Wycombe parish was therefore split again in December 1894, with the part within the borough becoming "Chepping Wycombe Urban" and the part outside it becoming "Chepping Wycombe Rural". Chepping Wycombe Rural was placed in the [[Wycombe Rural District]], whilst the Chepping Wycombe Municipal Borough covered the two parishes of Wycombe and Chepping Wycombe Urban. The two parishes within the borough merged on 30 September 1896 to form a single parish called High Wycombe, although the official name of the borough council which governed that parish remained "Chepping Wycombe Borough Council" until 1 August 1946, when it changed its name to "High Wycombe Borough Council".<ref>{{cite news |title=Bucks County Council: Uniting the parishes of Wycombe |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/ |access-date=3 June 2022 |work=South Bucks Standard |date=14 February 1896 |location=High Wycombe |page=5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Annual Report of the Local Government Board |date=1897 |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |location=London |page=276 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwpJAQAAMAAJ&q=annual+report+of+the+local+government+board |access-date=3 June 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Census Report 1951: County Report for Buckinghamshire |date=1953 |publisher=General Register Office |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZohD8cMkNcC&q=chepping+wycombe+borough+1946 |access-date=3 June 2022 |quote=On 1st August 1946 under Section 5 of the High Wycombe Corporation Act 1946, Chepping Wycombe M.B. was renamed High Wycombe.}}</ref> The surrounding Chepping Wycombe Rural parish changed its name to Chepping Wycombe parish in 1949.

From 1757 until 1932 the borough council met at the [[High Wycombe Guildhall|Guildhall]]. The council built [[High Wycombe Town Hall|Town Hall]] on Queen Victoria Road in 1904 as a public assembly hall and entertainment venue, with the intention of later extending it to also serve as council offices and meeting place, but the extension was never built. Instead, the council built the [[Municipal Offices, High Wycombe|Municipal Offices]] on Queen Victoria Road in 1932, which then acted as its meeting place and offices until the council's abolition in 1974.<ref>{{cite book|title=Local Government Act 1972. 1972 c.70|publisher=The Stationery Office Ltd|isbn=0-10-547072-4|year=1997}}</ref>

From 1974 to 2020, High Wycombe formed part of [[Wycombe District]], with its council being based at the former borough council's Municipal Offices (renamed District Council Offices) on Queen Victoria Road. Following further local government reorganisation in 2020 Wycombe District was abolished to become part of [[Buckinghamshire Council]].

At the beginning and end of each year of service, the mayor is weighed in full view of the public to see whether or not he or she has gained weight, presumably at the taxpayers' expense. The custom, which has survived to the present day, employs the same weighing apparatus used since the 19th century. When the result is known, the [[town crier]] announces "And no more!" if the mayor has not gained weight or "And some more!" if they have. Their actual weight is not declared.<ref name="Roud">{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Roud |title=The English Year: A month-by-month guide to the Nation's customs and festivals from May Day to Mischief Night |publisher=Penguin |date=2006 |isbn=9780140515541 |oclc=70671478}}{{Page needed|date=February 2024}}</ref>

==Education==
Buckinghamshire is one of the few counties that still has a selective educational system based on the former [[Tripartite system of education in England, Wales and Northern Ireland|tripartite system]]. Pupils in their last year at primary school take what is commonly known as the [[Eleven-plus exam|11+ exam]]. Their score in this exam determines whether they are accepted into a [[grammar school]] or a [[secondary modern school]].

===Further and higher education===
Buckinghamshire College Group is a [[further education]] college located near High Wycombe at [[Flackwell Heath]], with campuses also at [[Aylesbury]] and [[Amersham]].
High Wycombe is home to the main campus of [[Buckinghamshire New University]]. It is located in the centre of the town on the former site of the High Wycombe College of Art and Technology. It received its university charter in summer 2007.

==Media coverage==
High Wycombe has been featured in the national media in recent years for a number of different reasons, including seasonal coverage of the local library's refusal to display a Christmas carol service poster<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/dec/08/religion.communities | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Oliver | last=Burkeman | title=The phoney war on Christmas | date=8 December 2006}}</ref> and other stories such as the triple shooting<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/three-held-in-triple-shooting-3564153 |title=Three held in triple shooting |newspaper=[[Liverpool Echo]] |access-date=9 August 2016}}</ref> of three young Asian men, a small-scale riot between feuding families and gangs in which knives, metal poles, and an axe were used<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Gun+police+lay+siege+to+house+after+bloodbath.-a060650784 |title=Gun police lay siege to house after bloodbath. - Free Online Library |website=Thefreelibrary.com |access-date=9 August 2016}}</ref> whilst a gunman sprayed bullets; and the shooting and murder of Natasha Derby at [[point-blank range]] in the middle of a busy dance floor at a town centre venue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/s/2058784_wildwest_style_shooting_killed_natasha_derby_court_hears |title=Wild-West style shooting killed Natasha Derby, court hears |website=Getreading.co.uk |date=4 September 2004 |access-date=9 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/3635034.stm | work=BBC News | title=Mother in plea over reggae killer | date=8 September 2004 |access-date=25 February 2024}}</ref>

The town appeared in national and international media after [[Counter-terrorism|anti-terrorism]] raids were carried out across the town on 10 August 2006 as part of the [[2006 transatlantic aircraft plot]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/4778575.stm | work=BBC News | title='Airlines terror plot' disrupted | date=10 August 2006}}</ref>  Five arrests were made at three different houses in the town's Totteridge and Micklefield areas. A small number of houses in High Wycombe were evacuated in Walton Drive, which is thought to be because one of the raided houses contained dangerous liquid chemicals.

A {{convert|3|mi|km|0|abbr=off|spell=on}} [[no-fly zone|no-flight zone]] over the town was ordered. Other raids and arrests were also made in [[East London]] and [[Birmingham]].

King's Wood to the north of the town was cordoned off for four months to be searched by police, and many suspicious items were allegedly found including [[explosive]]s, detonators, weapons and [[Hate speech|hate]] tapes. Other woodlands in the [[Booker, Buckinghamshire|Booker]] area of the town and the [[M40 motorway|M40]] at High Wycombe as well as nearby woods were also under observation. Explosives officers were called to the motorway, as were [[Forensic science|forensic]] officers. A lane of the motorway was closed as a precaution.

On 21 December 2009, heavy snowfall hit the town, paralysing its road network (which is mainly on steep hills), and causing major disruption to refuse services for several weeks.  Staff and customers of the John Lewis department store were stranded overnight, leading to national news reports and interviews from [[GMTV]] and other radio stations on the morning of 22 December.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/weather/6864180/100-customers-and-staff-stranded-by-snow-sleep-in-John-Lewis-store.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225150533/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/weather/6864180/100-customers-and-staff-stranded-by-snow-sleep-in-John-Lewis-store.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=25 December 2009 | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=100 customers and staff stranded by snow sleep in John Lewis store | date=22 December 2009}}</ref>

There are two shopping centres: the [[Eden, High Wycombe|Eden Centre]] which spreads from the High Street under the Abbey Way flyover to the south of the A40; and the Chilterns Centre, which is located between Queen's Square and Frogmoor to the north.
The High Street ([[Pedestrian zone|pedestrianised]] in the early 1990s) has a number of 18th and 19th century buildings, and ends at the colonnaded [[High Wycombe Guildhall|Guildhall]] that was built in 1757 by [[Henry Keene (architect)|Henry Keene]], funded by the [[Earl of Shelburne]], and renovated in 1859.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Page |first1=William |title=Parishes: High Wycombe Pages 112-134 A History of the County of Buckingham: Volume 3.

The large parish church of All Saints<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allsaintshighwycombe.org |title=All Saints Church, High Wycombe - home |website=Allsaintshighwycombe.org |access-date=9 August 2016}}</ref> was founded in 1086, enlarged in the 18th century and extensively restored in 1889. There is a large, well equipped theatre, the [[Wycombe Swan]], which hosts many acts and shows before or after their appearance in the [[West End theatre|West End]].

In April 2008, a new development of the town centre was completed. This included the demolition and movement of the bus station and the brand new ''[[Eden, High Wycombe|Eden Shopping Centre]]'', with 107 shops, new restaurants, a large bowling alley and cinema and new housing. The old Octagon shopping centre was connected to the new development. The complex, one of the largest in the country, is seen as a major milestone in the regeneration of the town.

To the east of the town centre is the extensive Rye park (and [[River Wye, Buckinghamshire|river]]) and dyke. The park had an outdoor [[swimming pool]], which closed in 2009. The pool has now reopened together with a new gym and has been renamed as the Rye Lido.<ref name="ryelido">{{cite web|author=Simon Farr |url=http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/9791984.Council_boss_hails_Rye_Lido_ahead_of_centre_s_opening/ |title=Council boss hails Wycombe Rye Lido ahead of centre's opening |website=Bucksfreepress.co.uk |date=July 2012 |access-date=19 August 2020}}</ref> The River Wye winds through the green space, which is particularly attractive during the summer. Wycombe's yearly "Asian Mela" takes place on the Rye. There is a museum on Priory Avenue in the town centre situated on its own grounds and including a [[Normans|Norman]] [[castle]] [[Motte-and-bailey castle|mound]]. The theme of the museum is the history of Wycombe, with the main focus being the chair industry.

Wycombe town centre is home to many public houses and bars, especially in the Frogmoor area. The White Horse pub appeared on 'Britain's toughest pubs'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/whereilive/northwest/southbucks/453609.pub_owner_gets_tough_over_story/ |title=Pub owner gets tough over story (From This is Local London) |access-date=13 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222050815/http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/whereilive/northwest/southbucks/453609.pub_owner_gets_tough_over_story/ |archive-date=22 February 2014  }}</ref>

The town features the old [[Wycombe Summit]],<ref name="wycombesummit1">{{cite web|url=http://www.wycombesummit.co.uk/ |title=WYCOMBE SUMMIT England's longest ski & snowboard centre |website=Wycombesummit.co.uk |access-date=9 August 2016}}</ref> formerly the largest dry ski slope in England, before it was destroyed in a fire. Construction work was due to start in September 2008, on what would have become England's third and largest indoor real snow ski centre. In May 2009, it was announced that construction would be delayed due to 'difficulties getting a planning consent amendment.'<ref name="wycombesummit1"/> As of 31 January 2012 it was announced that the site was up for sale.<ref>{{cite web|author=Simon Farr |url=http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/9502822.Wycombe_Summit__ski_centre__site_up_for_sale/ |title=Wycombe Summit 'ski centre' site up for sale (From Bucks Free Press) |website=Bucksfreepress.co.uk |date=31 January 2012 |access-date=9 August 2016}}</ref>

[[Hughenden Manor]] borders the northern urban fringe of High Wycombe, approximately {{convert|2|mi|km|0|abbr=off|spell=on}} from the centre of town. Built in the [[Regency era|Regency period]], the architecturally appealing house was also home to [[Benjamin Disraeli]] for three decades in the mid-19th century. The three-floor mansion is situated in its own extensive grounds with beautifully landscaped gardens which back into the attractive Chiltern countryside. It is open to the public all year round as an historical attraction.

The local council maintains a landmark statue of a red lion above the former [[Woolworths Group (United Kingdom)|Woolworth's]] store on the High Street. Its significance dates back to when the building was the ''Red Lion Hotel''. Since its installation, the lion has been replaced several times and has had to undergo extensive repair due to damage from both the elements and human interference. Another notable landmark is the ruins of the [[Hospital of St John the Baptist, High Wycombe|Hospital of St John the Baptist]],<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Wycombe |volume=28 |page=871}}</ref> which is located on Easton Street, just east of the town centre opposite the Rye parkland, and dates to the 12th century. The stone structure is one of the very oldest in Wycombe, and is said to contain stone used from the Roman villa on the Rye.

The site of the ancient [[Desborough Castle]] is situated between the Desborough and Castlefield suburbs of the town, and provides their names.

==Industry==
Wycombe was once renowned for chairmaking (the town's football team is nicknamed the 'Chairboys') and furniture design remains an important element of the town's university curriculum, [[Buckinghamshire New University]]. Among the best known furniture companies were [[Ercol]] and [[E Gomme]]. The [[River Wye, Buckinghamshire|River Wye]] runs through the valley, where [[beech]] trees were cut down by the chair industry to forming the town centre (circa 1700), with housing along the slopes (some areas are still surrounded by woods). The town was also home to the worldwide [[postage stamp]] and [[banknote]] printer [[Harrison and Sons]]. More recent industries in the town include the production of paper, precision instruments, clothing and plastics. Many of these are situated in an industrial area of the Cressex district, southwest of the town centre. The two largest sites belong to the companies [[House of Swan|Swan]] (tobacco papers, filters and matches) and Verco (office furniture), who until 2004 sponsored the local football team, Wycombe Wanderers.

Wycombe's industrial past is reflected on the town's motto ''Industria ditat'', "Industry enriches".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pine|first1=L.G.|title=A dictionary of mottoes|date=1983|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=0-7100-9339-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofmott00tion/page/113 113]|edition=1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofmott00tion/page/113}}</ref>  The motto can be found on town crest and Mayor's badge of office.<ref name="High Wycombe Mayor's Office">{{cite web|url=http://mayorofwycombe.co.uk/history-and-traditions/history-of-wycombes-swan/ |title=History of Wycombe's swan « Mayor of High Wycombe |access-date=28 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724134535/http://mayorofwycombe.co.uk/history-and-traditions/history-of-wycombes-swan/ |archive-date=24 July 2011  }}</ref>

{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2020}}
Booker Gliding Club and two [[flying school]]s are based at [[Wycombe Air Park]], the modern name for Booker Airfield, to the south of the M40 motorway on the western edge of the town. Many of the replica aircraft used in the film industry, for example in films such as ''[[Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines]]'', ''[[Aces High (film)|Aces High]]'' and ''[[The Blue Max]]'' were built and flown from there. Wycombe Air Park is one of the busiest [[general aviation]] airfields in the UK. The Air Park is also home to Buckinghamshire Squash and Racketball Club.

==Housing==
A new experimental scheme to knock down old council flats in [[Micklefield, High Wycombe|Micklefield]] and replace them with [[housing association]] properties was approved by [[John Prescott]] in 2003 after overwhelming approval by council residents. There are many different housing areas within the town, some of which such as the Castlefield district have gained a bad reputation for crime and drug-related problems.

The town is a diverse mixture of large council estates built in the 1930s, 1950s and 1960s that sprawl up the valley sides, compact [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] terraces in the bottom of the valley to the east and west of town, and desirable areas for wealthy commuters. The Amersham Hill area is noted for its large period properties and leafy streets. Recent developments are showing a tendency towards blocks of flats, and developers are mainly making use of brownfield sites.

==Sport==
===Football===
The town's [[Association football|football]] team, [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], founded in 1887, play at [[Adams Park]], named after Frank Adams who donated the old [[Loakes Park]] ground to the club.<ref>{{cite web |title=Loakes Park 1947 - A gift to Wycombe Wanderers from Frank Adams |url=http://www.chairboys.co.uk/history/lprk1947.htm |website=www.chairboys.co.uk |access-date=20 August 2020}}</ref> They relocated to their current stadium in 1990. They currently play in [[EFL League One]] and have been members of the [[English Football League]] since 1993 when they were promoted as champions of the [[1992–93 Football Conference]]. Since then they have enjoyed two notable cup runs (to the semi-finals of the [[FA Cup]] in 2001 and the [[Football League Cup]] in 2007), and four recent promotions from the fourth tier of the English league to the third tier (via the playoffs in 1994, and automatically in 2009, 2011 and 2018), plus promotion from the third tier to the second tier (Championship) via the playoffs in 2020. They have been managed by a number of high-profile football figures, including [[Martin O'Neill]], [[Lawrie Sanchez]], [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]], and [[Gareth Ainsworth]]. Their current manager is former player [[Matt Bloomfield]].

===Rugby===

==Twin towns==
High Wycombe is [[sister city|twinned]] with:

==In popular culture==
High Wycombe is sometimes portrayed as a rather dull town where nothing much happens,<ref>{{cite web |title=Mad women, triple poisoners and parallel world portal: High Wycombe |url=https://slowchilterns.com/2018/08/26/mad-women-triple-poisoners-and-parallel-world-portal-high-wycombe/ |website=Slow Travel: The Chilterns and Thames Valley |access-date=20 August 2020 |language=en |date=26 August 2018}}</ref> as in this exchange between [[Kenneth Horne]] and [[Kenneth Williams]] in ''[[Round the Horne]]'':
