===Classical Antiquity===
[[File:Byzantine temple in Idlib (Ruweiha) Syria.jpg|thumb|left|[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] temple at [[Dead Cities|Ruweiha]] near Idlib.]]
Idlib, along with the rest of Syria were conquered by the [[Armenians|Armenian]] king [[Tigranes the Great]], and incorporated in the [[Armenian Empire]], only to be later conquered by the Roman [[Pompey the Great]] around 64 BC. The city was never of much significance, belonging to the province of [[Roman Syria]] under the [[Roman Empire]], and later to the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] province of Syria Secunda before being conquered by the [[Arabs]] around the middle of the seventh century. Not much remains from Roman and [[Byzantine]] times in the city, except in its museum. North of the city are the [[Dead Cities]], a collection of important archaeological sites from the Byzantine era.

===Ottoman era===
During early [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule in Syria, beginning in 1516, Idlib was a small ''[[timar]]'' (fief). The village of Idlib was founded by [[K√∂pr√ºl√ºzade Fazƒ±l Ahmed Pasha|Fadil Ahmed Pasha]], the son of Grand Vizier [[K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed Pasha]] ({{reign|1656|1661}}) who appointed him governor of [[Damascus Eyalet]]. In later years, it developed as a town with markets, [[Turkish bath|bathhouse]]s and [[caravanserai]]s, including Khan Abi Ali and Khan al-Ruz.{{sfn|Bakhit|2010|p=60}} 

From the K√∂pr√ºl√º period, Idlib was a center of olive production.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.haberturk.com/yazarlar/murat-bardakci/2135491-idlib-meshur-sadrazam-koprulu-mehmed-pasanin-en-buyuk-vakiflarindan-birinin-merkezi-idi|title=ƒ∞dlib, me≈ühur sadrazam K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed Pa≈üa'nƒ±n en b√ºy√ºk vakƒ±flarƒ±ndan birinin merkezi idi|website=haberturk.com|language=tr|date=9 September 2018}}</ref> which in turn gave way to a prosperous [[Aleppo soap|olive-based soap]] industry. Although the major markets for Idlib's soap were at [[Aleppo]], [[Antioch]], and [[Hama]],<ref name="Porter580">Porter, 1868, p. 580.</ref> the product was exported as far as the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] capital of [[Istanbul]]. Idlib was also a major producer of cotton fabrics.<ref>Inalcik, 1997, p.501.</ref> Western traveler [[Josias Leslie Porter]] noted that Idlib was "encompassed in olive groves, rare in this bleak region",<ref name="Porter580"/> and remarked that its olive groves were larger than those of Damascus, [[Beirut]], or [[Gaza City|Gaza]]. In the mid-19th-century, the town had an estimated population of 8,000, including 500 [[Arab Christian|Christians]].<ref name="Porter580"/> In the late 19th century, Idlib was "flourishing" and still contained a number of Christian families, according to German orientalist [[Albert Socin]].<ref name="Baedeker376">Baedeker, 1912, p.376.</ref>

===Syrian civil war and HTS takeover ===
{{Main|Syrian civil war}}
[[File:Ba'athist mural in Idlib.png|right|thumb|Ba'athist mural at the Mihrab roundabout in Idlib, defaced after the city's [[Battle of Idlib (2015)|capture]] by rebel forces in 2015.]]

During the [[Civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War|uprising since 2011]], Idlib was the focus of protests and fighting in the early phase of the Syrian war. As the uprising descended into armed conflict, Idlib became the focus of a rebel campaign, which temporarily captured the city and the governorate, prior to a government offensive in April 2012. After this, government forces retook the city and the rebel-controlled province after a month of fighting, prior to the attempted enforcement of the ceasefire proposed by [[Kofi Annan]]. After the [[2015 Idlib offensive]] in March, the rebel alliance [[Army of Conquest]], led by the [[al-Nusra Front]] and [[Ahrar al-Sham]], succeeded in the [[Second Battle of Idlib]] and captured the city,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/12392.aspx |title=Gulf allies and 'Army of Conquest |newspaper=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] |date=28 May 2015 |access-date=4 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531094633/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/12392.aspx |archive-date=31 May 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> as well as besieging the Shi'a-majority towns of [[Al-Fu'ah]] and [[Kafriya]] to the north of Idlib city.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11502899/Thousands-flee-Syrian-city-Idlib-after-rebel-capture.html | title=Thousands flee Syrian city Idlib after rebel capture | work=The Telegraph | date=29 March 2015 | access-date=29 March 2015 | author=Sherlock, Ruth | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329190137/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11502899/Thousands-flee-Syrian-city-Idlib-after-rebel-capture.html | archive-date=29 March 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref> In April 2015, the interim seat of the [[Syrian opposition]]'s [[Syrian Interim Government]] was proposed to be Idlib,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/politics/2015/04/syria-opposition-idlib-nusra-government-in-exile.html|title=Will Syrian opposition move interim government to Idlib? - Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|work=Al-Monitor|access-date=2016-12-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226065604/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/politics/2015/04/syria-opposition-idlib-nusra-government-in-exile.html|archive-date=2016-12-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> in Idlib Governorate.
