'''Aktobe''' ({{langx|kk|Ақтөбе|Aqtöbe}}, {{IPA-kk|ɑqtɵbʲe|pron|Kk-aktobe.ogg}}; {{langx|ru|Актобе }}) is a city on the [[Ilek River]] in [[Kazakhstan]]. It is the administrative center of the [[Aktobe Region]]. In 2023, it had a population of 560,820.<ref name="population_2023"/>

Aktobe is located in western Kazakhstan. The area of the city is about 428,469&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. There are two water reservoirs, Aktobe and Sazdy. It ranks fourth among the cities of Kazakhstan in terms of population, and is the largest city in western Kazakhstan. The city's populace is ethnically diverse, with 79% [[Kazakhs]] and 14.8% [[Russians]]. The predominant religions are [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]].

The agglomeration of Aktobe is expected to grow to 1.3 million people, including nearby settlements.<ref name="auto">{{cite web |url=https://www.stat.gov.kz/api/getFile/?docId=ESTAT355258 |title=Численность населения Республики Казахстан по отдельным этносам на начало 2020 года |publisher=Stat.kz |access-date=2020-08-06 |archive-date=2020-05-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200527204929/https://www.stat.gov.kz/api/getFile/?docId=ESTAT355258 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Aktobe'' comes from Kazakh ақ 'white' and төбе 'hill'; the name refers to the heights on which the original 19th-century settlement was located. Until 1999, the city was officially known as ''Aktyubinsk'' ({{langx|ru|Актюбинск}}).

==History==

===Founding and growth===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2020}}
The territory of the modern-day [[Aktobe Region]] has seen the rise and fall of many [[Central Asian]] cultures and empires. The region figured prominently in the history of the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] "[[Little jüz|Little Horde]]". The Kazakh warlord [[Eset Kotibaruli|Eset Batyr]] based his campaigns against the [[Dzungars]] from this area. His mausoleum is located {{cvt|35|km|abbr=off}} to the south of Aktobe city. [[Abulkhair Khan]] (1693–1748) was also based in this region.

In March 1869, a Russian military fort with a garrison of 300 was built at the confluence of the [[Kargala]] and [[Ilek River]]s, along the [[Orenburg]] - [[Kazalinsk]] [[Caravan (travellers)|caravan]] route. From that period onward, [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] settlers began to migrate to the region in order to farm, and very soon, neighbourhoods were built around the fort. In 1874 the fort was expanded in size, and streets were laid out to and from the fort's gate. In 1891 the settlement was labelled a district city, and officially named Aktyubinsk.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the settlement rapidly expanded in size. While the 1889 population was listed as 2,600, by 1909 the population had increased more than four times to 10,716 official residents. The physical characteristics of the city had developed as well, and by the turn of the century the city had two churches, a seminary, a [[Tatar]] mosque, a Russian-[[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] boys' school and girls' school, a clinic, a bank, a post office, a city park, a cinema and two mills. The [[Trans-Aral Railway]] was extended through the city in 1901. In the years leading up to World War I, industry began to develop in the town, including the construction of an electric factory, a brick factory, and the establishment of an annual trade fair.

The city was affected by the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], and strikes and riots took place between 1905 and 1907. [[Bolshevik]] revolutionaries were very active in the city, according to official Soviet histories. On January 8, 1918, the Bolsheviks moved to seize control of the local [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]], and by January 21, 1918, the Bolsheviks had secured the city under their control.

===Russian Civil War===
With its location on the Trans-Aral Railway, Aktyubinsk was a strategic point, much contested between the [[Red Army]] and their [[White Movement|White]] opponents during the [[Russian Civil War]]. Kazakh and Russian inhabitants of Aktyubinsk and its environs actively supported both sides in the conflict.

In mid-1918, elements of the Bolshevik First Orenburg and Twenty-eighth Regiments, commanded by [[Georgy Zinoviev]], were effectively besieged in Aktyubinsk by forces commanded by [[Alexander Dutov|Ataman Dutov]]. Dutov, commanding approximately 10,000 rifles, 5,000 sabres, and 500 ''jigits'' (warriors) of the [[Alash Orda]] movement's newly formed Second Kazakh Mounted Regiment, attacked the city in October, 1918. The attack only reached as far as the village of [[Ak Bulak]].<ref>Olcott, Martha Brill. ''The Kazakhs'', 2nd edition. Hoover Institution Press. Stanford, CA, 1995. p. 149</ref>

In the autumn of 1918, [[Mikhail Frunze]]'s [[5th Army (RSFSR)|Fifth Army]] and [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]]'s [[1st Army (RSFSR)|First Army]] were ordered to break through and clear the railway, in order to allow Red Army forces to link up with Bolsheviks along the [[Syr Darya]]. White pressure on Aktyubinsk was relieved by Frunze's capture of [[Uralsk]], [[Orenburg]] and [[Orsk]] in early 1919, but by April Dutov and [[Admiral Kolchak]] were able to launch a combined counteroffensive. Aktyubinsk finally fell to the Whites on April 18, 1919, once again severing Bolshevik rail links to Central Asia.<ref>''Ibid'', p. 150</ref> In this offensive, the Whites also managed to capture and execute [[Amankeldı İmanov]], a Kazakh military leader who had been operating in the Aktyubinsk region with the support of Bolsheviks in Moscow.

By June 1919, Frunze had received reinforcements and had moved back on to the offensive. On September 10, Aktyubinsk was secured by the Fifth Army after an eight-day battle. 20,000 of Kolchak's troops were captured, along with the easternmost part of the city.<ref>''Ibid'', p. 152</ref> From this point, Bolshevik forces were able to control the railway to Tashkent.

An All-Kazakhstan Conference of Soviet Workers was held in the city on March 13, 1920. This was the first of a series of regional organizing conferences held by the Bolsheviks that ultimately led to the creation of the [[Kirghiz Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic (1920–25)|Kirgiz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] - the entity that would ultimately develop into the Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan.

===Modern history===
In 1932, Aktyubinsk was named capital city of Aktyubinsk Region. The city developed extensively during [[World War II]] as a result of the evacuation and reconstruction of factories from Ukraine and from Moscow, including a worker's cooperative, a [[ferroalloy]] factory, and an X-ray factory. [[Chromium]] also began to be mined and processed in the region. In the 1960s, an extensive expansion of the city was undertaken by Soviet authorities, resulting in the construction of a city center and a sports stadium.

The city's society and economy have dramatically changed since Kazakhstan's independence in 1991. Older heavy industries have declined and been replaced in importance with the energy sector. The city has continued to expand with new construction and with many Kazakh immigrants moving to the city from the surrounding countryside.

In 1999, the official name was changed from Aktyubinsk to '''Aktobe''' by presidential decree, as part of a nationwide effort to support the Kazakh language.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aboutkazakhstan.com/aktobe-city |title=Aktobe city, Kazakhstan overview, history, photos |access-date=2016-01-23 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129220419/http://aboutkazakhstan.com/aktobe-city |archive-date=2016-01-29}}</ref>

On May 17, 2011 Aktobe was the site of one of Kazakhstan's first terrorist attacks, when a suicide bomber [[2011 Aktobe bombing|blew himself up in the headquarters of the local national security services]]. Some analysts have interpreted this as a sign of increasing instability in the oil-rich, but socially unequal, region.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://eurasianet.org/kazakhstan-astana-confronts-extremist-threat |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808015716/http://www.eurasianet.org/node/64133 |url-status=dead |title=Kazakhstan: Astana Confronts Extremist Threat &#124; Eurasianet |archive-date=August 8, 2016 |website=eurasianet.org}}</ref>

Further [[2016 Aktobe shootings|attacks]] by suspected Islamist militants occurred on June 5–6, 2016.

==Geography==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2020}}
[[File:Aktobe (Kazakhstan), satellite image 2017-09-07.jpg|thumb|Aktobe and vicinities ([[European Space Agency|ESA]] [[Sentinel-2]] satellite image)]]
[[File:Kargala River.JPG|right|thumb|The Kargala River flows into the Ilek River on the outskirts of Aktobe]]
Aktobe Region is located in Western Kazakhstan, and is the second largest region by area in Kazakhstan. The city of Aktobe is located where the Kargala and Ilek rivers meet. It is in the north-central part of Aktobe Region. The Russian city of [[Orenburg]] is located some {{cvt|200|km|abbr=off}} to the northwest, while the Russian city of [[Orsk]] is about {{cvt|150|km|abbr=off}} to the northeast. The area around the city of Aktobe is mostly flat steppe, with low hills rising to the northeast. Other rivers, such as the Emba and the [[Ural River]], flow through the region. The region is bordered on the south by the Aral Sea. The natural vegetation cover around Aktobe city is steppe, while the southern parts of the region are semi-desert.

===Hydrography===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2020}}
The city is located at the place where Kargaly flows into the Ilek River and its valley expands to 15&nbsp;km. Directly in the center of the city flows the left tributary of Ilek - the Sazdy River, in the northwest - the left tributary of Ilek - the Zhinishke River. Since the channel of the Sazdy River lies in the central part of Aktobe and along it are large shopping and entertainment centers. In the southern part of the city are the lower reaches of the left tributary of Ilek - the Tamda River, but in the low-water period this channel dries up, forming several stretches. On the northern outskirts of the Zarechny district, the Peschanka river flows, the left tributary of the Kargaly, beyond which is the village of Kargaly. To the west of the Kirpichny district, separating it from the village of Akzhar, the Butak River flows through the lower part of the right tributary of the Kargaly.

At 10&nbsp;km southeast of the city is the Aktobe reservoir with a volume of 245 million m<sup>3</sup>, called the inhabitants of the Aktobe Sea, it was commissioned in 1988. The Sazdinskoye reservoir, 8&nbsp;km south-west of the city, which is a traditional resting place for citizens, was built in 1967, and the Kargaly reservoir, which is the largest artificial reservoir near Aktobe (located outside the territory of the city administration), the volume of which is 280 million m<sup>3</sup>, was commissioned in 1975 and is located 60&nbsp;km northeast of the city.

=== Climate ===
Aktobe has a [[Humid continental climate#Hot/warm summer subtype|humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfa''), with wide seasonal variations in temperature. In winter, temperatures can reach a low of {{cvt|-48|°C|°F}}, with a daily average minimum of {{cvt|-16|°C|°F}}. Summer temperatures can reach a high of {{cvt|43|°C|°F}}, with an average maximum temperature of {{cvt|30|°C|°F}}. The weather can change rapidly, especially during spring and autumn (the especially windy days in March when the weather changes are known locally as the Бес Қонақ, or "Five Guests"). Precipitation usually occurs in early spring and late autumn/early winter, and is otherwise sporadic throughout the year. Overall, Aktobe receives about {{cvt|330|mm|in}} of precipitation per year. <!-- <ref>Bies, Lammert ''[http://www.wild-natures.com/photo052.html  Map of Kazakhstan: Yearly Rainfall and Evaporation]'', Wild Natures, 2003</ref> --> The seasonal swings are exceptionally strong for the latitude due to its position right at the centre of the massive [[Eurasia]]n landmass.

===Vegetation===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2020}}
At the end of the 19th century, the region in which Aktobe was located was described as practically devoid of forest flora, but at the same time very rich in steppe vegetation. Deforestation in the then Aktyubinsk district led to the spread of sand from the neighboring Irgiz district and the disappearance of previously rich vegetation. In Soviet times, measures were taken to create a "green belt" around the city to protect against winter storms and summer dust storms.

The territory of the city is part of the Aktobe floristic district, which occupies more than half of the Aktobe region and the north-eastern part of the West Kazakhstan region. The following types of plants are widespread in Aktobe and its environs: desert sage, clover poppy and others.

===Fauna===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2020}}
The territory of Kazakhstan consists of 22 zoogeographic sites. The city of Aktobe and the entire northern part of the Aktobe region belongs to the western steppe site, in which, unlike other steppe sites, representatives of European forest species live. In addition, in the western steppe area, the [[Xerocole|desert fauna]] is richer than in other steppe areas. The widespread desert species of dressings here is found only occasionally, from the Mongolian fauna you can usually see an Eversman hamster. Kazakh desert species also live here, and near Aktobe you can find the Turanian species of combed [[Gerbillinae|gerbils]].

==Demographics==
{{More citations needed section|date=December 2020}}
Aktobe ranks first in terms of population in Western Kazakhstan and is the fourth city in the country by this indicator (after Almaty, Astana and Shymkent). Aktobe rose in October 2019 from fifth to fourth place in terms of the number of inhabitants when the population of the city reached 497,381 inhabitants, overtaking Karaganda (496,701 people) in this indicator. By the end of 2019, the population of the city stepped over 500,000 people and as of January 1, 2020, numbered 500,803 people. The population density in the territory of the city administration (2,338&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) is 214.2 people per km<sup>2</sup>.

There are several reasons for changes of this position. First, the statistical authorities began to take into account 59,000 residents of rural districts near Aktobe, disbanded in 2018 and included in the city. Secondly, the natural population growth in Aktobe for nine months of 2019 numbered 6,807 people, while in Karaganda during the same period the natural increase reached 2,712 people. Thirdly, during the same period in Aktobe there was a migration increase numbering 2580 people, while in Karaganda there was a migration decrease numbering 3,741 people.

Aktobe is one of the fastest-growing cities in Kazakhstan – in 2003–2013 the population increased by 50%. For comparison, the population of the cities of Turkestan, Zhanaozen and Kaskelen, which showed the most impressive growth rates, grew by 78% over the indicated period. An increase in the birth rate and a decrease in the number of child deaths contribute to the city's population.

The main sources of urban population growth are natural growth and migration. So (data for the territory subordinated to the city administration) for the period from January 1, 2011 to October 1, 2015, the natural population growth numbered 36,158 people, and the positive balance of migration growth numbered 3,798 people, but the latter figure hides the multi-directional migration flows.

Migration outside the CIS (mainly ethnic Germans, as well as Russians traveling to Germany as members of mixed families) is insignificant, its balance was 76 people, while migration outflow to Germany numbered 103 people, migration exchange with other countries outside the CIS was weakly positive.

Migration within the CIS had a slight positive balance (371 people), but this is the result of the mutual compensation of two significant migration flows: the outflow of Russians (migration balance - 1,221 people, mainly to Russia) and the influx of ethnic Kazakhs (migration balance of 1,173 people), mainly from the countries of Central Asia).

Migration exchange with other regions of Kazakhstan had a negative migration balance of 5,437 people, mainly it was an outflow of ethnic Kazakhs (balance −5,073 people).

Intraregional migrations forming a migratory influx of the population of 9,685 people is the result of the mutual compensation of two significant migration flows: the outflow of Russians (migration balance - 1,221 people, mainly to Russia) and the influx of ethnic Kazakhs (migration balance of 1,173 people), mainly from the countries of Central Asia).

Migration exchange with other regions of Kazakhstan had a negative migration balance of 5,437 people, mainly it was an outflow of ethnic Kazakhs (balance −5,073 people).

[[File:Aktobe New Buildings.jpg|thumb|New buildings in Aktobe]]
Agriculture and ranching play a large role in Aktobe Region's economy and in rural employment. [[Beef]], [[Lamb and mutton|mutton]] and [[dairy]] products are major products in this area.
 
Heavy industry was established in Aktobe during the Second World War. Many of today's fastest-growing industries in Aktobe are related to food production (such as the company "Ramazan"), construction ("Dastan") or vodka distilling ("Wimpex" and "Ayazhan"). A number of foreign companies, notably German and Austrian firms, have established partnerships with local light industry firms. Both [[copper]] and [[chromite]] are mined in the [[Khromtau]] district of Aktobe Region.

However, the major engine of economic growth in Aktobe and Aktobe Region has been the development of energy resources. The Chinese National Petroleum Company ([[CNPC]]) owns a 60% stake in AktobeMunaiGaz, and is investing heavily in oil and natural gas extraction from Aktobe Region oilfields.<ref>''[http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?search=1&volume_id=2&issue_id=242&article_id=2742 Kazakhstan, China Sign Multibillion Dollar Oil Deal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930192019/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?search=1&volume_id=2&issue_id=242&article_id=2742 |date=2007-09-30 }}'' Jamestown Foundation, 1997</ref> A [[Kazakhstan-China oil pipeline|pipeline]] has been constructed to transport oil to [[Xinjiang]] (see [[#Energy and utilities|Energy and Utilities]]).

The revenues from oil and gas extraction have helped to develop banking, real estate, and support services in Aktobe.

The region also possesses large deposits of [[phosphorite]]. One of the largest known being Chilisai deposit, the British company Sunkar Resources Plc (2008) has built an integrated production facility to develop one of the lowest cost producers of phosphate fertiliser in the world with its Chilisai Project (800Mt of ore averaging 10.5% P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=39103279 |title=Sunkar Resources Plc: Private Company Information - Bloomberg |website=www.bloomberg.com |access-date=2017-07-06 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327160205/https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=39103279 |archive-date=2018-03-27}}</ref>

The Aktobe Ferroalloy Plant (Aktobe Ferroalloy Plant), commissioned in 1943, became the first ferrous metallurgy enterprise in Kazakhstan.

The cost of production of the city's enterprises in 2014 reached 257.9 billion tenge (1.44 billion US dollars) and amounted to 20.7% of the total regional indicators, which is 1.7% lower than the previous year. The metallurgical industry accounts for more than 30% of all production produced in the city, and the chemical industry accounts for 10.3% of the total.
