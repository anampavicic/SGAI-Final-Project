{{harvp|Sanatomba, Interrogation into the political status of Manipur|2015|loc=pp. 172–193: "Furthermore, Section 9(b) of the Manipur State Constitution Act, 1947, would certainly dispel any doubt about the titular status of the Maharaja, which was expressedly stated thus: ‘The Maharaja means His Highness, the Maharaja of Manipur, the constitutional head of the state.’ The Maharaja in his capacity as the constitutional ruler could not execute the Instrument without proper authorisation and constitutional endorsement. This was simply on account of the fact that he was not a sovereign ruler and that Manipur was not a sovereign state then. Therefore, the act of signing the Instrument of Accession on 11 August 1947 by the Maharaja could not be considered an Act of the State. Hence, the Instrument was deemed null and void right from the moment it was executed... For example, the Indian Dominion had never existed on or before 11 August 1947. Being so, it can be aptly said that the Maharaja acceded to a political non-entity. Therefore, it can be claimed that the Instrument was never executed in actuality. It was simply pre-judicial to execute the Instrument between two political entities which were yet to be born."}}

The history of Manipur Meiteis is chronicled in [[Puya (Meitei texts)|Puyas]] or Puwaris (stories about the forefathers), namely, the Ninghthou Kangbalon, Cheitharol Kumbaba, Ningthourol Lambuba, Poireiton Khunthokpa, Panthoibi Khongkul, and so forth in the [[Meitei script]], which is comparable to the [[Thai script]]. The historical accounts presented here were recordings from the eyes and the judgment of Meitei kings and {{Interlanguage link|Maichou|simple}} (Meitei scholars).

==== The Kingdom of Mongkawng and Mongmao  ====
According to the Tai chronicles, Manipur (Kahse) is one of the territories conquered by Samlongpha (1150–1201), the first [[Chao Pha]] of [[Mongkawng]].<ref>{{harvcol|Gogoi|1956|p=133}}</ref> A 14th-century inscription from [[Bagan|Pagan]], [[Myanmar]], mentions Kasan (Manipur) as one of the 21 states under the [[Mong Mao]] ruler Thonganbwa (1413–1445/6); he later was captured by the Governor of [[Taungdwingyi]].<ref>{{harvcol|Luce|Htway|1976|p=214}}</ref>

====Vassal State of the Toungoo empire====

====Vassal state of Konbaung dynasty====

In the 18th century, [[Bodawpaya]], the king of Burma acquired the Manipur (1814) along with the western kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Mrauk U|Arakan]] (1784), [[Upper Assam|Assam]] (1817).

In 1824, the ruler of Manipur entered into a [[subsidiary alliance]] with the British Empire in the Indian subcontinent, which became responsible for Manipur's external defence. The British recognised that the state remained internally self-governing, as a [[princely state]].<ref>

===="Disturbed area" designation====
From 1980 to 2004, the Indian government referred to Manipur as a ''disturbed area.'' This term (designated by the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] or a [[Governors of states of India|state governor]]) refers to a territory where extraordinary laws under the [[Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act]] can be used. The laws allow the military to treat private and public spaces in the same manner, detain individuals for up to 24 hours with unlimited renewals, perform warrantless searches, and to shoot and kill individuals who break laws, carry weapons, or gather in groups larger than four. Legal immunity applies to the military.<ref>McDuie-Ra, Duncan. 2016. ''Borderland city in new India: Frontier to gateway'' (pp. 15, 17–19). Amsterdam University Press.</ref> Since 1980, the application of AFSPA has been at the heart of concerns about [[human rights]] violations in the region, such as arbitrary killings, torture, cruel, [[inhuman or degrading treatment|inhuman and degrading treatment]], and [[forced disappearance]]s. Its continued application has led to numerous protests, notably the longstanding hunger strike by [[Irom Sharmila Chanu]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-37007494 |title=Irom Sharmila: World's longest hunger strike ends |work=BBC News |date=9 August 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/indian-campaigner-irom-chanu-sharmila-end-16-year-hunger-strike |title=Indian hunger striker Irom Chanu Sharmila to end 16-year fast |website=[[TheGuardian.com]] |date=9 August 2016 }}</ref>

In 2004, the government lifted the ''disturbed'' status after a violent attack on a local woman. The rape of a Manipuri woman, [[Thangjam Manorama Devi]], by members of the [[Assam Rifles]] paramilitary had led to wide protests including a nude protest by the [[Meira Paibi]] women's association.<ref>McDuie-Ra, Duncan. 2016.

[[File:Landscape of Valley.jpg|thumb|left|Landscape view for dawn at Senapati, Manipur]]
Almost all the rivers in the valley area are in the mature stage and therefore deposit their sediment load in the [[Loktak Lake]].<ref name="www.e-pao.net" /> The rivers draining the Manipur Hills are comparatively young, due to the hilly terrain through which they flow. These rivers are corrosive and become turbulent in the rainy season. Important rivers draining the western area include the Maku, [[Barak River|Barak]], Jiri, Irang, and Leimatak. Rivers draining the eastern part of the state, the Yu River Basin, include the Chamu, Khunou and other short streams.<ref name=":3" />

Manipur may be characterised as two distinct physical regions: an outlying area of rugged hills and narrow valleys, and the inner area of flat plain, with all associated landforms. These two areas are distinct in physical features and are conspicuous in flora and fauna. The valley region has hills and mounds rising above the flat surface. The Loktak Lake is an important feature of the central plain. The total area occupied by all the lakes is about 600&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. The altitude ranges from 40 m at [[Jiribam]] to 2,994 m at [[Mount Tempü]] peak along the border with Nagaland.

The soil cover can be divided into two broad types, viz. the red [[Iron oxide|ferruginous]] soil in the hill area and the [[alluvium]] in the valley. The valley soils generally contain loam, small rock fragments, sand, and sandy clay, and are varied. On the plains, especially flood plains and deltas, the soil is quite thick. The topsoil on the steep slopes is very thin. Soil on the steep hill slopes is subject to high erosion, resulting in [[gullies]] and barren rock slopes. The normal pH value ranges from 5.4 to 6.8.<ref>{{cite news |author=Director of Commerce and Industries, Manipur |access-date=31 October 2010 |title=Soil and Climate of Manipur |url=http://investinmanipur.nic.in/gp_soil.htm  }}</ref>

The six major forest types, according to the state's Forest Department, include Tropical Wet Evergreen Forest, Tropical Moist Deciduous Forests, Sub-Tropical Pine Forest, Tropical Dry Deciduous Forest, Montane Wet Temperate Forest and Sub-alpine Forest.<ref name=":4" />

There are forests of [[teak]], [[pine]], [[oak]], [[Phoebe hainesiana|uningthou]], leihao, bamboo, and [[Arundo|cane]]. [[Rubber tree|Rubber]], [[tea]], [[coffee]], [[Orange tree|orange]], and [[cardamom]] are grown in hill areas. [[Rice]] is a staple food for Manipuris.<ref name=":2" />

===Climate===
[[File:The Dzukou Valley.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Dzüko Valley]] which exists between the boundaries of Manipur and Nagaland has a temperate climate.]]

Manipur's climate is largely influenced by the topography of the region. Lying 790 metres above sea level, Manipur is wedged among hills on all sides. This northeastern corner of India enjoys a generally amiable climate, though the winters can be chilly. The maximum temperature in the summer months is {{cvt|32|C}}. The coldest month is January, and the warmest July.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

The state receives an average annual rainfall of {{cvt|1467.5|mm}} between April and mid-October. Precipitation ranges from light drizzle to heavy downpour. The capital city [[Imphal]] receives an annual average of {{cvt|933|mm}}. Rainfall in this region is caused by The South Westerly [[Monsoon]] picking up moisture from the [[Bay of Bengal]] and heading towards the [[Eastern Himalaya]] ranges. This normal rainfall pattern of Manipur enriches the soil and much of the agrarian activities are dependent on it as well.

Manipur is already [[Climate change in India|experiencing climate change]], especially [[Impacts of climate change|changes in weather]], with both increased [[Extreme weather|variability in rain]] as well as increasingly severe changes in temperature.<ref>{{Cite web |last=SAMOM |first=SOBHAPATI |title=Manipur affected by changing climate, say scientists |url=https://nenow.in/north-east-news/manipur-affected-by-changing-climate-say-scientists.html  |website=NorthEast Now |date=31 May 2019 }}</ref>

{{Main|Manipuri people}}
The [[Meitei people|Meiteis]]<ref name="Khomdan Singh Lisam pp 322"/> (synonymous to the [[Manipuris]]) constitute the majority of the state's population. They inhabit the [[Imphal Valley]]. Nagas and Kuki-Zo are the major tribe conglomerates of tribes inhabiting the surrounding hills. The Kuki-Zos consist of several tribes including [[Gangte people|Gangte]], [[Hmar people|Hmar]], [[Paite people|Paite]], [[Simte people|Simte]], [[Sukte people|Sukte]], [[Thadou people|Thadou]], [[Vaiphei people|Vaiphei]], [[Zou people|Zou]], and some smaller tribes.

The prominent Naga tribes are [[Angami Naga|Angami]], [[Kabui people|Kabui]], [[Kacha Naga]], [[Mao people (India)|Mao]], [[Maram people|Maram]], [[Poumai people|Poumai]], [[Sümi Naga|Sema]] and [[Tangkhul people|Tangkhul]], each speaking its own language. They predominate the northern hill districts of Manipur. In addition, several smaller tribes that were classified as "Old Kuki" by the British administrators populate [[Chandel district|Chandel]] and neighbouring districts. Some of them now classify themselves as Nagas while others retain the Kuki classification.{{Efn|The Old Kuki tribes retaining the Kuki classification include: Aimol, Chiru, Kom, Koireng, Kharam, and Ralte.

The [[Meitei people|Meitei ethnicity]] (aka [[Manipuri people]]) is the majority group following Hinduism in Manipur, beside other minor immigrants following the same faith in the state. Among the indigenous communities of Manipur, [[Meiteis]] are the only Hindus as no other indigenous ethnic groups follow this faith. 
According to the [[2011 Census of India]], about 41.39% of the Manipuri people practice [[Hinduism]]. The Hindu population is heavily concentrated in the Meitei dominant areas of the Manipur Valley ([[Imphal Valley]]), among the Meitei people.

Secular theatre is mostly confined to themes that are not religious; it is performed in the secular or profane spheres. In these are ''Shumang lila'' and ''Phampak lila'' (stage drama). ''Shumang lila'' is very popular. Etymologically Shumang lila is the combination of "Shumang" (courtyard) and "[[Lila (given name)|Lila]]" (play or performance). It is performed in an area of 13×13&nbsp;ft in the centre of any open space, in a very simple style without a raised stage, set design, or heavy props such as curtains, background scenery, and visual effects. It uses one table and two chairs, kept on one side of the performance space. Its claim as the "theatre of the masses" is underlined by the way it is performed in the middle of an audience that surrounds it, leaving one passage as entrance and exit.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The world of ''Phampak lila'' (stage drama) performed in the proscenium theatre is similar, in form, to the Western theatrical model and Indian [[Natyasastra]] model though its contents are indigenous. The so-called modern theatre descended on Manipur theatre culture with the performance of Pravas Milan (1902) under the enthusiastic patronage of [[Maharaja Churchand Singh|Sir Churchand Maharaj]] (1891–1941). The pace of theatrical movement was geared up with the institution of groups such as [[Manipur Dramatic Union]] (MDU) (1930), Arian Theatre (1935), Chitrangada Natya Mandir (1936), Society Theatre (1937), Rupmahal (1942), Cosmopolitan Dramatic Union (1968), and the Chorus Repertory Theatre of [[Ratan Thiyam]] (1976).{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} These groups started experimenting with types of plays apart from historical and [[Puranas|Puranic]] ones. Today Manipur theatre is well respected because of excellent productions shown in India and abroad. Manipur plays, both ''Shumang lila'' and ''stage lila'', have been a regular feature in the annual festival of the [[National School of Drama]], New Delhi.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

[[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Iskcon]] led by [[Bhaktisvarupa Damodar Swami|Bhaktisvarupa Damodara Swami]] started a network of schools in Northeastern India, where more than 4,000 students receive education centred on Vaishnava spiritual values. In 1989 he founded "Ranganiketan Manipuri Cultural Arts Troupe", which has approximately 600 performances at over 300 venues in over 15 countries. Ranganiketan (literally "House of Colorful Arts") is a group of more than 20 dancers, musicians, singers, martial artists, choreographers, and craft artisans.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Some of them have received international acclaim.

[[Yubi lakpi]] is a traditional full contact game played in Manipur, India, using a coconut, which has some notable similarities to [[rugby football|rugby]].<ref name=ksl826/> ''Yubi lakpi'' literally means "coconut snatching". The coconut is greased to make it slippery. There are rules of the game, as with all Manipur sports.<ref>[http://manipur.gov.in/?p=23 Indigenous games of Manipur] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512142602/http://manipur.gov.in/?p=23 |date=12 May 2015 }} Govt of Manipur</ref> The coconut serves the purpose of a ball and is offered to the king, the chief guest or the judges before the game begins. The aim is to run while carrying the greased coconut and physically cross over the goal line, while the other team tackles and blocks any such attempt as well as tries to grab the coconut and score on its own. In Manipur's long history, Yubi lakpi was the annual official game, attended by the king, over the Hindu festival of Shree Govindajee.<ref>Khomdan Singh Lisam, Encyclopaedia Of Manipur, {{ISBN|978-8178358642}}, pp 825</ref> It is like the game of [[Rugby sevens|rugby]],<ref>Mills, J.

==Festivals==
[[File:Lai haraoba manipur.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Lai Haraoba]], a dance festival showcases the folk dances of Manipur.]]
The festivals of Manipur are Lui-ngai-ni [[Ningol Chakouba]], Shirui Lily festival, [[Yaoshang]], Gan-ngai, Chumpha, [[Sajibu Nongma Panba|Cheiraoba]], Kang and [[Heikru Hidongba]], as well as the broader religious festivals [[Eid al-Fitr|Eid-Ul-Fitr]], [[Eid al-Adha|Eid-Ul-Adha]] and [[Christmas]]. Most of these festivals are celebrated on the basis of the lunar calendar. Almost every festival celebrated in other states of India is observed.

On 21 November 2017, the Sangai Festival 2017 was inaugurated by President [[Ram Nath Kovind]] in Manipur. Held for 10 days, the festival is named after Manipur's state animal, the brow-antlered Sangai deer. The Sangai Festival showcases the tourism potential of Manipur in the field of arts and culture, handloom, handicrafts, indigenous sports, cuisine, music and adventure sports.
