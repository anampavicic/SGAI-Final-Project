[[File:Port of Sorong.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Port of Sorong]]
'''Sorong''' is the largest [[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia|city]] and the capital of the [[Indonesian province]] of [[Southwest Papua]]. The city is located on the western tip of the island of New Guinea with its only land borders being with [[Sorong Regency]]. It is the gateway to Indonesia's [[Raja Ampat Islands]], species rich [[coral reef]] islands in an area considered the heart of the world's coral reef [[biodiversity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/knowledge_hub/where_we_work/coraltriangle/coraltrianglefacts/places/rajaampatindonesia/|title=Raja Ampat, Indonesia}}</ref>  It also is the logistics hub for Indonesia's thriving eastern oil and gas frontier. Sorong experienced rapid growth during the decade from 2010, and further growth is anticipated as Sorong [[Trans-Papua Highway|becomes linked by road]] to other frontier towns in Papua's [[Bird's Head Peninsula]]. The official estimate of population as at mid 2023 was 294,978 - comprising 154,543 males and 140,435 females.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Sorong Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.9271)</ref> The suburban area of Sorong city contains tropical rainforest and mangrove forest that has increasingly become popular as ecotourism attractions especially for birdwatching or wildlife watching.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Roring |first=Charles |title=Sorong City Sightseeing and Birdwatching Tour |url=https://www.wildlifepapua.com/2024/04/sorong-city-sightseeing-and.html?m=1 |access-date=2024-10-01 |language=en}}</ref> 

==Etymology==
The origin of Sorong's name comes from the word ''Soren'', which means "deep and wavy ocean" in the [[Biak language]]. The name was first used by the [[Numfor|Biak-Numfor]] people who sailed to different islands before they finally decided to settle down in [[Raja Ampat Islands]]. When the Biak-Numfor people came to the place called "Daratan Maladum", they decided to call it ''Soren''. After centuries of contact with Chinese merchants, European missionaries, and people from Maluku and Sangihe-Talaud, the name underwent further change into '''Sorong'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kemendagri.go.id/pages/profil-daerah/kabupaten/id/92/name/papua-barat/detail/9271/kota-sorong|title=Etymology of Sorong}}</ref>

==History==
[[Dutch East Indies|Dutch]] influence over the region was minimal until the 20th century, when a colonial post was established on [[Doom Island]] in 1906, serving as the Dutch administrative center of the region.<ref>{{cite book |title=Indonesia Reports |date=1986 |publisher=Indonesia Publications |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fq0uAQAAIAAJ |accessdate=August 15, 2023 |language=en}}</ref> In the 1930s, the Dutch oil company ''Nederlandsch Nieuw Guinee Petroleum Maatschappij'' (NNGPM) had discovered oil off the coast of Sorong.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McGibbon |first1=Rodd |title=Plural Society in Peril: Migration, Economic Change, and the Papua Conflict |journal=East-West Center |date=2004 |page=8 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep06523 |access-date=16 August 2023}}</ref>  The newly established oil fields led to the expansion of Dutch colonial influence in [[Western New Guinea]], and had made Sorong into a valuable military target. During [[World War II]], Sorong was occupied by the [[Empire_of_Japan#World_War_II_(1941–1945)|Empire of Japan]] in 1942, and would serve as the center of operations for Japanese forces during the [[Western New Guinea campaign]]. The [[Battle of Sansapor]] in June 1944 would effectively end Japanese control over the Bird's Head Peninsula, and by August 1944 any remaining Japanese presence in the region was removed by the [[6th_Infantry_Division_(United_States)|US 6th Division]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morison |first1=Samuel Eliot |title=History of United States Naval Operations in World War II: New Guinea and the Marianas, March 1944 – August 1944 |date=2001 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn=0-252-07038-0 |pages=140–144 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-KfgdHvv88C&pg=PA140 |access-date=16 August 2023}}</ref> After the [[Indonesian National Revolution|Indonesian War of Independence]], the [[Dutch New Guinea|colonial administration]] would attempt to expand oil production with the construction of the 58 kilometer Klamono-Sorong pipeline.<ref name="Poulgrain">{{cite journal |last1=Poulgrain |first1=Greg |title=Delaying the 'Discovery' of Oil in West New Guinea |journal=The Journal of Pacific History |date=September 1999 |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=215–216 |jstor=25161079 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25161079 |access-date=16 August 2023}}</ref> However, oil production declined after the war, and by 1961 oil production had dropped another 33%. This decline in production contributed to the demise of the Dutch colonial administration, as the Dutch administration over the territory could no longer be defended as economically viable. Under Indonesian administration, oil production would return to pre-war levels, and by 1967 production had more than trebled from 1961 levels.<ref name="Poulgrain"/> Today, the city still remains as one of the major oil and gas producers of Indonesian New Guinea. 

In 1972, Sorong was reformed into an autonomous city, and then reformed into an [[City status in Indonesia|administrative city]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite news |title=History of Sorong City |url=https://westpapuadaily.com/history-of-sorong-city.html |access-date=16 August 2023 |work=West Papua Daily News Update |date=29 September 2021}}</ref> Administrative cities were abolished in 1999, granting Sorong full city status, and separating Sorong City from the [[Sorong Regency]].<ref>{{cite act |type=Law |index=45 |date=1999 |article= |article-type= |legislature= |title=Undang-undang Nomor 45 tahun 1999 tentang Pembentukan Daerah Propinsi Irian Jaya Tengah, Daerah Propinsi Irian Jaya Barat, Daerah Kabupaten Paniai, Daerah Kabupaten Mimika, Daerah Kabupaten Puncak Jaya, Dan Daerah Kabupaten Puncak Jaya Dan Daerah Kota Sorong|trans-title= |url=https://www.dpr.go.id/jdih/index/id/446|language=id}}</ref>

==Administrative districts==
At the 2010 Census, the city comprised six [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''distrik''), but the number has subsequently been increased to ten by the splitting of existing districts. These are tabulated below with their populations at the 2010 Census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 2020 Census,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> together with the official estimates for mid-2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Sorong Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.9271)</ref> The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centres, the number of [[administrative village]]s (all classed as urban ''kelurahan'', 41 in total) in each district, and its post code.

== In popular culture ==
The phrase "Sorong to Samarai" is commonly used throughout Papua New Guinea and [[Western New Guinea|Indonesian Papua]] to express solidarity and oneness and makes reference to both Sorong, a town in [[Southwest Papua]], Indonesia and [[Samarai]], a small township being one of the easternmost point located in [[Milne Bay Province]], Papua New Guinea. It is sometimes used by [[Free Papua Movement|Papuan independence]] activists in reference to Papuan unification, in opposition to the common Indonesian phrase of "[[Sabang, Aceh|Sabang]] to [[Merauke]]". In 2016, the [[ARIA Music Awards]]-nominated Papua New Guinean-Australian musician [[Airileke]] released a single titled "Sorong Samarai".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/2016/12/01/sorong-samarai-expressing-unity-calling-change|title=Sorong Samarai - Expressing unity, calling for change}}</ref>
