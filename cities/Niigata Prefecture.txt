{{Nihongo|'''Niigata Prefecture'''|新潟県|Niigata-ken}} is a [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]] in the [[Chūbu region]] of [[Honshu]] of [[Japan]].<ref>Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "Niigata-ken" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 711|page=711}}</ref> Niigata Prefecture has a population of 2,131,009 (1 July 2023) and is the [[List of Japanese prefectures by area|fifth-largest prefecture]] of Japan by geographic area at {{cvt|12,584.18|sqkm}}. Niigata Prefecture borders [[Toyama Prefecture]] and [[Nagano Prefecture]] to the southwest, [[Gunma Prefecture]] to the south, [[Fukushima Prefecture]] to the east, and [[Yamagata Prefecture]] to the northeast.

[[Niigata, Niigata|Niigata]] is the capital and largest city of Niigata Prefecture, with other major cities including [[Nagaoka, Niigata|Nagaoka]], [[Jōetsu, Niigata|Jōetsu]], and [[Sanjō, Niigata|Sanjō]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Niigata" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 711|page=711}}</ref> Niigata Prefecture contains the Niigata Major Metropolitan Area centered on Niigata with a population of 1,395,612, the largest [[metropolitan area]] on the [[Sea of Japan]] coast and the twelfth-largest in Japan. Niigata Prefecture is part of the historic [[Hokuriku region]] and features [[Sado Island]], the sixth largest island of Japan in area following the [[List of islands of Japan|four main islands]] and [[Okinawa Island]].

== History ==
{{See also|Historic Sites of Niigata Prefecture}}
{{stack|[[File:Linsenji 1.jpg|thumb|Rinsenji Temple, the family temple of Uesugi]]}}
Until after the [[Meiji Restoration]], the area that is now Niigata Prefecture was divided into [[Echigo Province]] (on the mainland) and [[Sado Province]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Provinces and prefectures" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 780|page=780}}</ref>  During the [[Sengoku period]], the [[Nagao clan]], who were at times vassals to the Uesugi, ruled a fief in the western part of modern Niigata from Kasugayama Castle. The most notable member of the Nagao clan was Nagao Kagetora, later and better known as [[Uesugi Kenshin]]. He unified the leaders of Echigo Province and became its sole ruler. By taking the surname Uesugi, he also became the head of the Uesugi clan and effectively brought their realm under his control.

The city of Niigata is now the third largest Japanese city facing the Sea of Japan, after [[Fukuoka]] and [[Kitakyushu]]. It was the first Japanese port on the Sea of Japan to be opened to foreign trade following the opening of Japan by [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Matthew Perry]]. It has since played an important role in trade with [[Russia]] and [[Korea]]. A freighter from [[North Korea]] visits Niigata once a month, in one of the few forms of direct contact between Japan and that country.

The [[Etsuzankai]] organization, led by the politician [[Kakuei Tanaka]], was highly influential in bringing infrastructure improvements to Niigata Prefecture in the 1960s and 1970s. These included the [[Jōetsu Shinkansen]] [[high-speed rail]] line and the [[Kanetsu Expressway]] to Tokyo.

On October 23, 2004, the [[2004 Chūetsu earthquake|Chūetsu earthquake]] struck Niigata Prefecture and was measured at [[Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale|Shindo]] 6+ at [[Ojiya, Niigata|Ojiya]].

On January 9, 2006, a heavy [[winter storm]] struck the prefecture and its neighbors. At least 71 people died and more than 1,000 were injured. Also in 2006, a massive tsunami and earthquake damaged homes and caused casualties in the maritime areas of Niigata Prefecture, especially near [[Sado, Niigata|Sado Island]].

On July 16, 2007, another [[2007 Niigata earthquake|earthquake]] hit the area.

Niigata Prefecture hosts the [[Fuji Rock Festival]], an annual event held at the Naeba ski resort. The three-day event, organized by Smash Japan, features more than 200 Japanese and international musicians. It is one of the largest outdoor music events in Japan, with more than 100,000 people attending in 2005.

Niigata Prefecture stretches about {{cvt|240.|km}} along the [[Sea of Japan]], from the southwest to the northeast, with a coastal plain between the mountains and the sea. It also includes [[Sado, Niigata|Sado Island]]. Niigata Prefecture could be placed in either the [[Hokuriku region|Hokuriku]] or the [[Kōshin'etsu region|Kōshinetsu]], both of which are considered parts of the [[Chūbu region]].
The prefecture is generally divided into four geographical areas: {{nihongo|[[Jōetsu region]]|上越}} in the south, {{nihongo|[[Chūetsu]]|中越}} in the center, {{nihongo|[[Kaetsu]]|下越}} in the north, and [[Sado, Niigata|Sado Island]]. The mouth of the [[Shinano River]], the longest river in Japan, is located in Niigata Prefecture.

As of 1 April 2014, 25% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as [[List of national parks of Japan#History|Natural Parks]], namely [[Bandai-Asahi National Park|Bandai-Asahi]], [[Chūbu-Sangaku National Park|Chūbu-Sangaku]], [[Nikkō National Park|Nikkō]], and [[Oze National Park|Oze]] National Parks; [[Echigo Sanzan-Tadami Quasi-National Park|Echigo Sanzan-Tadami]] and [[Sado-Yahiko-Yoneyama Quasi-National Park|Sado-Yahiko-Yoneyama]] Quasi-National Parks; and thirteen Prefectural Natural Parks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/nature/nps/park/doc/files/np_6.pdf |title=General overview of area figures for Natural Parks by prefecture |publisher=[[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] |date=1 April 2014 |access-date=14 February 2015}}</ref>

== Economy ==

===Agriculture, forestry and fishing===
[[File:400dpi (800x538) 魚沼産コシヒカリ 航空写真.jpg|thumb|Paddy fields in Minamiuonuma]]
The major industry in Niigata Prefecture is agriculture. Rice is the principal product, and among the prefectures of Japan Niigata is second only to [[Hokkaidō]] in rice output. The area around [[Uonuma, Niigata|Uonuma]] is known for producing the Koshihikari variety, widely considered to be the highest-quality rice produced in Japan.

Rice-related industries are also very important to the prefectural economy. Niigata Prefecture is known throughout Japan for its high-quality [[sake]], [[senbei]], [[Mochi (food)|mochi]], and [[Arare (food)|arare]]. In [[sake]] production, the prefecture comes third after [[Gunma Prefecture|Gunma]] and [[Kyoto Prefecture|Kyoto]] prefectures.

The prefecture was also the place of origin of the ornamental [[carp]] known as [[koi]].

Niigata Prefecture produces the highest volume of [[azalea]]s and cut [[lily|lilies]] in Japan, and is increasing the production of cut flowers and flower bulbs. Along with [[Toyama Prefecture]], it produces the highest volume of [[tulip]]s in the country.
===Mining and manufacturing===
[[File:史跡佐渡金山_-_panoramio.jpg|thumb|Ruins of Kitazawa Flotation Plant, [[Sado mine|Sado gold mine]]]]
[[Crude oil]] is produced in Niigata Prefecture, although Japan relies heavily on petroleum imported from other countries. [[Kerosene heater]]s are also produced for use in the cold Niigata winters.

Kinzan, on [[Sado, Niigata|Sado Island]], was an active [[gold mine]] until it was closed in 1989.

[[Sanjō, Niigata|Sanjō]] and [[Tsubame, Niigata|Tsubame]] produce 90 percent of all the silverware made in Japan. The two cities are second after [[Osaka]] in the production of [[scissors]], [[Japanese kitchen knives|kitchen knives]], nail clippers and [[wrench]]es.

Niigata Prefecture may have been the first area in Japan to produce [[textile manufacturing|knitted textiles]], although the earliest products may have been imported from China. A [[nuclear power plant]], which formerly had the highest energy output in the world,{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} is located in the tiny village of [[Kariwa, Niigata|Kariwa]].  It has been closed since the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Japanese Anti-nuclear Candidate Wins Election at Site of World's Biggest Atomic Power Station|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/japanese-anti-nuclear-candidate-wins-election-at-site-of-worlds-biggest-atomic-power-station|access-date=17 October 2016|agency=Reuters|work=The Guardian|date=17 October 2016}}</ref>
