'''Zarqa''' ({{langx|ar|الزرقاء}}) is the capital of [[Zarqa Governorate]] in [[Jordan]]. Its name means "the blue (city)". It had a population of 635,160 inhabitants in 2015,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dos.gov.jo/dos_home_a/main/population/census2015/No_of_pop_depand_on_GOV.pdf|title=The General Census - 2015 |publisher=Department of Population Statistics}}</ref> and is the second most populous city in Jordan after [[Amman]].

==History==
[[File:JHR Bahnhof Az Zarqa.jpg|thumb|left|The Zarqa train station of the Ottoman-built [[Hejaz Railway]].]]
Although the area has been inhabited since the first century AD, the city of Zarqa was only established in 1902, by [[Chechens in Jordan|Chechen]] immigrants who were displaced due to the wars between the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] Empires.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Natho, Nadir I., 1927-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/712591748|title=Circassian history|date=2009|publisher=Nadir I.

At that time a station on the [[Hejaz Railway]] was built in the new settlement. The railway station turned Zarqa into an important hub. On 10 April 1905, the Ottoman governor issued a decree that allowed the Chechen immigrants to own the land they had settled on. The population then quickly grew in size. On 18 November 1928, the new Jordanian government issued a decree to establish the first municipal council for Zarqa.

After the [[Transjordan Frontier Force]] was formed in 1926, military bases were constructed in the city by the [[British Army]], and the city later became known as the "military city".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zarqa.gov.jo/node/277 |title=تاريــخ مديــنة الزرقــــاء &#124; وحدة التنمية و التخطيط - محافظة الزرقاء |access-date=December 9, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212171438/http://www.zarqa.gov.jo/node/277 |archive-date=December 12, 2009 }}</ref> The headquarters of Jordan's [[Arab Legion]] were also located in Zarqa.

The oldest Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan, known as [[Zarqa Camp]], is located near the city. It was set up by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] in 1949, after the [[Nakba]] and the subsequent exodus of Palestinian refugees from the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]]. Although the camp initially consisted of tents, [[UNRWA]] eventually replaced these tents with concrete shelters.<ref>{{cite web |title=Zarqa Camp |url=https://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/jordan/zarqa-camp |website=UNRWA |publisher=United Nations |access-date=January 20, 2023}}</ref> More refugees came to Zarqa after the 1990–91 [[Gulf War]], when the [[Palestinian exodus from Kuwait (1990–91)|Kuwaiti government expelled a quarter-million Palestinians]], whom it suspected of supporting Saddam Hussein's Iraq in that war. More than half of those expelled went to Zarqa or the nearby city of [[Russeifa]].<ref name="riedel">{{cite book |last1=Riedel |first1=Bruce |title=The Search for Al Qaeda: Its Leadership, Ideology, and Future |date=2010 |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |location=Washington |page=89}}</ref> 

During the [[Black September]] conflict in 1970, [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] members hijacked five airplanes, and forced three to land at [[Dawson's Field hijackings|Dawson's Field]], an airstrip in the desert near Zarqa.

Zarqa is regarded today as a "marginalized" and "conservative" city,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pizzi |first1=Michael |title=Foreign fighters come home to roost in Jordan |url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/6/5/jordans-foreign-fighters-come-home-to-roost.html |access-date=January 20, 2023 |work=Al Jazeera |date=June 5, 2015}}</ref> with a large Palestinian population.<ref name="riedel"/> It is a stronghold of political [[Islamism]], and is home to many supporters of the opposition [[Islamic Action Front]] party, which is the political wing of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in Jordan.
