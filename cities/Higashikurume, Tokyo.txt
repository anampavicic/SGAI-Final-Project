==History==
The area of present-day Higashikurume was part of ancient [[Musashi Province]]. In the post-[[Meiji Restoration]] cadastral reform of April 1, 1889, Kurume Village were established within [[Kitatama District, Tokyo|Kitatama District]] of [[Kanagawa Prefecture]].  The entire district was transferred to the control of Tokyo Prefecture on April 1, 1893. The area began development after connection to central Tokyo was established by the Musashino Railway from 1915. In 1956, the village of Kurume attained town status. In the 1960s and 1970s, the population rapidly expanded with the construction of large [[public housing]] estates. The city was founded on October 1, 1970.

=== Etymology of the city name ===
The origin of the name ''Kurume'' is unclear, but there are several theories:

* as a variante of the ancient "kuruma muchibe", maintenance staff of the emperor's [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]]
* a dialect form of the Japanese word for "walnut"
* a word meaning "small, flat place"
* The theory that the "Kurome" of the [[Kuromegawa River]]：黒目川 flowing through the city turns into the place name of "Kurume". Originally, the Kurome River was also called "Kurume" River, the later people used the kanji notation such as Kurume＝久留米or久留目or来梅・Kurome＝黒目etc. . This was later recognised as the most likely theory.

At the time of the founding of the city, the name was changed to ''Higashikurume'' in order to avoid being confused for [[Kurume, Fukuoka]]. Since the new name already had already existed since 1915 as the name of the local train station, the name was already familiar to residents and adopted quickly.<ref>{{cite book |date=1983 |script-title=ja:東久留米市文化財資料集(9) |trans-title=Higashikurume City Cultural Properties Collection |language=Japanese |publisher=Higashikurume City|page=2f}}</ref>

In terms of national politics, the city is part of [[Tokyo 20th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].
