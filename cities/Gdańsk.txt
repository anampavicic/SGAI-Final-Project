The city has a complex history, having had periods of Polish, German and self rule. An important shipbuilding and trade port since the [[Middle Ages]], in 1361 it became a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] which influenced its economic, demographic and [[#Architecture|urban landscape]]. It also served as Poland's principal seaport, and was the largest city of Poland in the 15th-17th centuries. In 1793, within the [[Partitions of Poland]], the city became part of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], and thus a part of the [[German Empire]] from 1871 after the [[unification of Germany]]. Following [[World War I]] and the [[Treaty of Versailles]], it was a [[Free City of Danzig|Free City]] under the protection of the [[League of Nations]] from 1920 to 1939. On 1 September 1939 it was the scene of the [[Battle of Westerplatte|first clash]] of [[World War II]] at [[Westerplatte]]. The contemporary city was shaped by extensive [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|border changes]], [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|expulsions]] and [[Gdańsk#Demographics|new settlement]] after 1945. In the 1980s, Gdańsk was the birthplace of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement, which helped precipitate the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]], the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] and the dissolution of the [[Warsaw Pact]].

Gdańsk is home to the [[University of Gdańsk]], [[Gdańsk University of Technology]], the [[National Museum, Gdańsk|National Museum]], the [[Gdańsk Shakespeare Theatre]], the [[Museum of World War II in Gdańsk|Museum of the Second World War]], the [[Polish Baltic Philharmonic]], the [[Polish Space Agency]] and the [[European Solidarity Centre]]. Among Gdańsk's most notable historical landmarks are the [[Gdańsk Town Hall|Town Hall]], the [[Green Gate]], [[Artus Court]], [[Neptune's Fountain, Gdańsk|Neptune's Fountain]], and [[St. Mary's Church, Gdańsk|St. Mary's Church]], one of the largest brick churches in the world. The city is served by [[Gdańsk Lech Wałęsa Airport]], the country's [[List of airports in Poland|third busiest airport]] and the most important international airport in northern Poland.

Gdańsk is among the most visited cities in Poland, having received 3.4 million tourists according to data collected in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gdansk.pl/wiadomosci/Ile-turystow-Gdansk-2019-rok-turystyka-co-zwiedzic-w-gdansku,a,164557 |language=pl |title=Wszystkie Strony Miasta.

=== Origin===
[[File:Johannes Canaparius (Jan Kanapariusz) Gyddanyzc Gdańsk Danzig.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A manuscript fragment featuring ''gydda<sup>n</sup>yzc'']]
The name of the city was most likely derived from ''Gdania'', a river presently known as [[Motława]] on which the city is situated.<ref>{{cite book |last=Breza |first=Edward |date=2002 |title=Nazwiska Pomorzan.

=== History===
The name of the settlement was recorded after [[Adalbert of Prague|St. Adalbert's]] death in 997 CE as ''urbs Gyddanyzc'' and it was later written as ''Kdanzk'' in 1148, ''Gdanzc'' in 1188, ''Danceke''<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VfEeAAAAMAAJ&q=Zwantepolc |first=Marian |last=Gumowski |title=Handbuch der polnischen Siegelkunde |year=1966 |language=de |access-date=11 February 2016 |archive-date=8 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211008134300/https://books.google.com/books?id=VfEeAAAAMAAJ&q=Zwantepolc |url-status=live }}</ref> in 1228, ''Gdańsk'' in 1236,{{efn|Also in 1454, 1468, 1484, and 1590}} ''Danzc'' in 1263, ''Danczk'' in 1311,{{efn|Also in 1399, 1410, and 1414–1438}} ''Danczik'' in 1399,{{efn|Also in 1410, 1414}} ''Danczig'' in 1414, and ''Gdąnsk'' in 1656.<ref>{{cite book |first=Carl |last=Tighe |title=Gdańsk: national identity in the Polish-German borderlands |publisher=[[Pluto Press]] |year=1990 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MkBpAAAAMAAJ&q=Gyddanyzc |isbn=9780745303468 |access-date=11 February 2016 |archive-date=8 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211008115634/https://books.google.com/books?id=MkBpAAAAMAAJ&q=Gyddanyzc |url-status=live }}</ref>

In Polish documents, the form Gdańsk was always used. The German form Danzig developed later, simplifying the consonant clusters to something easier for German speakers to pronounce.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Treder |first=Jerzy |date=2007 |title=Historyk o nazwach "Gdańsk" i "Gdania" |journal=Acta Cassubiana |volume=9 |pages=48}}</ref> The cluster "gd" became "d" (''Danzc'' from 1263),{{Sfn|Śliwiński|2006|p=12}} the combination "ns" became "nts" (''Danczk'' from 1311).,{{Sfn|Śliwiński|2006|p=12}} and finally an [[epenthesis|epenthetical]] "i" broke up the final cluster (''Danczik'' from 1399).{{Sfn|Śliwiński|2006|p=12}}

In Polish, the modern name of the city is pronounced {{IPA|pl|ɡdaj̃sk||Pl-Gdańsk.ogg}}. In English (where the [[Polish alphabet|diacritic]] over the "n" is frequently omitted) the usual pronunciation is {{IPAc-en|ɡ|ə|ˈ|d|æ|n|s|k}} or {{IPAc-en|ɡ|ə|ˈ|d|ɑː|n|s|k}}. The German name, ''Danzig'', is usually pronounced {{IPA|de|ˈdantsɪç||De-Danzig2.ogg}}, or alternatively {{IPA|de|ˈdantsɪk||De-Danzig3.ogg}} in more Southern German-speaking areas. The city's [[Latin]] name may be given as either ''Gedania'', ''Gedanum'', or ''Dantiscum''; the variety of Latin and German names typically reflects the difficulty of pronunciation of the Polish/Slavonic city's name, all German- and Latin/Romance-speaking populations always encounter in trying to pronounce the difficult and complex Polish/Slavonic words.

===Ceremonial names===
On special occasions, the city is also referred to as "The Royal Polish City of Gdańsk" (Polish: ''Królewskie Polskie Miasto Gdańsk'', Latin: ''Regia Civitas Polonica Gedanensis'', Kashubian: ''Królewsczi Pòlsczi Gard Gduńsk'').<ref>Gdańsk, in: Kazimierz Rymut, ''Nazwy Miast Polski'', [[Ossolineum]], Wrocław 1987</ref><ref>Hubert Gurnowicz, ''Gdańsk'', in: ''Nazwy must Pomorza Gdańskiego'', [[Ossolineum]], Wrocław 1978</ref><ref>''Baedeker's Northern Germany'', [[Baedeker|Karl Baedeker Publishing]], Leipzig 1904</ref> In the [[Kashubian language]] the city is called {{lang|csb|Gduńsk}}. Although some Kashubians may also use the name "Our Capital City Gduńsk" (''Nasz Stoleczny Gard Gduńsk'') or "Our (regional) Capital City Gduńsk" (''Stoleczny Kaszëbsczi Gard Gduńsk''), the cultural and historical connections between the city and the region of [[Kashubia]] are debatable and use of such names raises controversy among Kashubians.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Labuda |first=Aleksander |date= |title=Gduńsk, nasz stoleczny gard |url=http://strona.kaszebsko.nazwa.pl/uploads/symbole/Gdu%C5%84sk,%20nasz%20stoleczny%20gard.pdf |magazine=Zrzesz Kaszëbskô |location= |publisher= |access-date=10 December 2022 |archive-date=8 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220308190400/http://strona.kaszebsko.nazwa.pl/uploads/symbole/Gdu%C5%84sk,%20nasz%20stoleczny%20gard.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Ancient history===
The oldest evidence found for the existence of a settlement on the lands of what is now Gdańsk comes from the [[Bronze Age]] (which is estimated to be from 2500&ndash;1700 BCE). The settlement that is now known as Gdańsk began in the 9th century, being mostly an [[agriculture]] and [[fishing]]-dependent village.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://historia.trojmiasto.pl/historia-gdanska.html |title=Gdańsk na przestrzeni dziejów |website=Trójmiasto.pl Historia |publisher=Trójmiasto |access-date=15 December 2021 |quote= |archive-date=15 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211215162949/https://historia.trojmiasto.pl/historia-gdanska.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://polskatampabay.com/2018/04/09/gdansk-jedno-z-najstarszych-polskich-miast/ |title=Gdańsk – jedno z najstarszych polskich miast |date=9 April 2018 |website=Polska Tampa Bay |publisher= |access-date=15 December 2021 |quote= |archive-date=15 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211215180000/http://polskatampabay.com/2018/04/09/gdansk-jedno-z-najstarszych-polskich-miast/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In the beginning of the 10th century, it began becoming an important centre for [[trade]] (especially between the [[Pomeranians (tribe)|Pomeranians]]) until its annexation in {{circa}} 975 by [[Mieszko I]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gedanopedia.pl/gdansk/?title=GDA%C5%83SK_%E2%80%93_POCZ%C4%84TKI_MIASTA |title=GDAŃSK – POCZĄTKI MIASTA |date=25 December 2019 |website=Gedanopedia |publisher=Gdańsk Foundation |access-date=15 December 2021 |quote= |archive-date=9 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200609183651/https://www.gedanopedia.pl/gdansk/?title=GDA%C5%83SK_%E2%80%93_POCZ%C4%84TKI_MIASTA |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Pomeranian Poland===
[[File: Hala Targowa w Gdańsku podziemia.jpg|thumb|Excavated remains of 12th-century buildings in Gdańsk]]
The site was ruled as a [[Duke|duchy]] of Poland by the [[Samborides]]. It consisted of a settlement at the modern Long Market, settlements of craftsmen along the Old Ditch, German merchant settlements around St Nicholas' Church and the old Piast stronghold.<ref name=Hess40>{{cite book |title=Danziger Wohnkultur in der frühen Neuzeit |first=Corina |last=Hess |publisher=LIT Verlag |location=Berlin-Hamburg-Münster |year=2007 |isbn=978-3-8258-8711-7 |page=40}}</ref> In 1215, the ducal stronghold became the centre of a [[Pomeranian duchies and dukes#Duchy of Pomerelia|Pomerelian splinter duchy]]. At that time the area of the later city included various villages.

In 1224/25, merchants from [[Lübeck]] were invited as ''hospites'' (immigrants with specific privileges) but were soon (in 1238) forced to leave by [[Swietopelk II, Duke of Pomerania|Swietopelk II]] of the Samborides during a war between Swietopelk and the [[Teutonic Knights]], during which Lübeck supported the latter.

In 1300, the town had an estimated population of 2,000. While overall the town was far from an important trade centre at that time, it had some relevance in the trade with [[Eastern Europe]]. Low on funds, the Samborides lent the settlement to Brandenburg, although they planned to take the city back and give it to Poland. Poland threatened to intervene, and the Brandenburgians left the town. Subsequently, the city was taken by Danish princes in 1301.<ref>{{cite book |title=Danziger Wohnkultur in der frühen Neuzeit |first=Corina |last=Hess |publisher=LIT Verlag |location=Berlin-Hamburg-Münster |year=2007 |isbn=978-3-8258-8711-7 |pages=40–41}}</ref>

Although it left the legal basis of the Order's possession of the province in some doubt, the city thrived as a result of increased exports of grain (especially wheat), timber, [[potash]], tar, and other goods of forestry from Prussia and Poland via the [[Vistula]] River [[trade route|trading routes]], although after its capture, the Teutonic Knights tried to actively reduce the economic significance of the town. While under the control of [[Teutonic Knights|the Teutonic Order]] German migration increased.

In 1440, the city participated in the foundation of the [[Prussian Confederation]] which was an organisation opposed to the rule of the Teutonic Knights. The organisation in its complaint of 1453 mentioned repeated cases in which the Teutonic Knights imprisoned or murdered local patricians and mayors without a court verdict.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Górski|first=Karol|title=Związek Pruski i poddanie się Prus Polsce: zbiór tekstów źródłowych|year=1949|publisher=Instytut Zachodni|location=Poznań|language=pl|pages=16, 18}}</ref> On the request of the organisation King [[Casimir IV Jagiellon|Casimir IV of Poland]] reincorporated the territory to the Kingdom of Poland in 1454.<ref>Górski, pp. 51, 56</ref> This led to the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454–1466)|Thirteen Years' War]] between Poland and the [[State of the Teutonic Order]] (1454–1466).

Gaining free and privileged access to Polish markets, the seaport prospered while simultaneously trading with the other Hanseatic cities. After the [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)]] between Poland and the Teutonic Order the warfare ended permanently; Gdańsk became part of the Polish province of [[Royal Prussia]], and later also of the [[Greater Poland Province, Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Greater Poland Province]]. The city was visited by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] in 1504 and 1526, and ''[[Narratio Prima]]'', the first printed abstract of his [[heliocentric theory]], was published there in 1540.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://szlakkopernikowski.pl/pl/gdansk|title=Gdańsk|website=Szlak Kopernikowski|access-date=11 January 2024|language=pl}}</ref> After the [[Union of Lublin]] between Poland and Lithuania in 1569 the city continued to enjoy a large degree of internal autonomy (cf.

In the 1560s and 1570s, a large [[Mennonite]] community started growing in the city, gaining significant popularity.<ref>{{cite book |last=de Graaf |first=Tjeerd |author-link= |date=2004 |title= The Status of an Ethnic Minority in Eurasia: The Mennonites and Their Relation with the Netherlands, Germany and Russia |url= |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn=}}</ref> In the 1575 election to the Polish throne, Danzig supported [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] in his struggle against [[Stephen Báthory of Poland|Stephen Báthory]].

After the [[Siege of Danzig (1577)|Siege of Danzig]], lasting six months, the city's army of 5,000 mercenaries was utterly defeated in a field battle on 16 December 1577. However, since Stephen's armies were unable to take the city by force, a compromise was reached: [[Stephen Báthory of Poland|Stephen Báthory]] confirmed the city's special status and her [[Danzig law]] privileges granted by earlier [[List of Polish monarchs|Polish kings]]. The city recognised him as ruler of Poland and paid the enormous sum of 200,000 [[Guilder|guldens]] in gold as payoff ("apology").<ref>{{cite web |url=https://historykon.pl/bitwa-pod-lubieszowem-w-swietle-wybranych-zrodel-pisanych/ |title=Bitwa pod Lubieszowem w świetle wybranych źródeł pisanych |last=Włusek |first=Andrzej |date=23 May 2017 |website=HistoryKon |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>

In 1772, the [[First Partition of Poland]] took place and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] annexed almost all of the former Royal Prussia, which became the [[Province of West Prussia]]. However, Gdańsk remained a part of Poland as an [[exclave]] separated from the rest of the country. The [[List of monarchs of Prussia|Prussian king]] cut off Danzig with a military controlled barrier, also blocking shipping links to foreign ports, on the pretense that a [[cattle plague]] may otherwise break out. Danzig declined in its economic significance. However, by the end of the 18th century, Gdańsk was still one of the most economically integrated cities in Poland. It was well-connected and traded actively with [[German cities]], while other [[Polish cities]] became less well-integrated towards the end of the century, mostly due to greater risks for long-distance [[trade]], given the number of [[Violence|violent]] conflicts along the trade routes.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Baten |first1=Jörg |last2=Wallusch |first2=Jacek |date=2005 |title=Market Integration and Disintegration of Poland and Germany in the 18th Century |journal=Economies et Sociétés}}</ref>

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], in 1807, the city was [[Siege of Danzig (1807)|besieged and captured]] by a coalition of [[First French Empire|French]], [[Polish Legions (Napoleonic period)|Polish]], [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italian]], [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxon]], and [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]] forces. Afterwards, it was a [[Free City of Danzig (Napoleonic)|free city]] from 1807 to 1814, when it was [[Siege of Danzig (1813)|captured]] by combined Prussian-Russian forces.

Since the 1820s, the [[Wisłoujście Fortress]] served as a prison, mainly for Polish political prisoners, including [[Resistance movements in partitioned Poland (1795–1918)|resistance members]], protesters, insurgents of the [[November Uprising|November]] and [[January Uprising|January]] uprisings and refugees from the [[Russian Partition]] of Poland fleeing conscription into the Russian Army,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kubus| first=Radosław| year=2019|title=Ucieczki z twierdzy Wisłoujście w I połowie XIX wieku|journal=Vade Nobiscum|location=Łódź| publisher=Wydawnictwo [[University of Łódź|Uniwersytetu Łódzkiego]]|language=pl| volume=XX|pages=154–155}}</ref> and insurgents of the November Uprising were also imprisoned in [[Biskupia Górka]] (''Bischofsberg'').<ref>{{cite book|last=Kasparek|first=Norbert|editor-last=Katafiasz|editor-first=Tomasz| year=2014|title=Na tułaczym szlaku...

With the growth of [[Nazism]] among Germans, [[anti-Polish sentiment]] increased and both [[Germanisation]] and [[Racial segregation|segregation]] policies intensified, in the 1930s the rights of local Poles were commonly violated and limited by the local administration.<ref name="auto"/> Polish children were refused admission to public Polish-language schools, premises were not allowed to be rented to Polish schools and preschools.<ref name=mw40>Wardzyńska, p. 40</ref> Due to such policies, only eight Polish-language public schools existed in the city, and Poles managed to organize seven more private Polish schools.<ref name=mw40/>

In the early 1930s, the local [[Nazi Party]] capitalised on pro-German sentiments and in 1933 garnered 50% of vote in the parliament. Thereafter, the Nazis under [[Gauleiter]] [[Albert Forster]] achieved dominance in the city government, which was still nominally overseen by the League of Nations' [[High Commissioner]].

In 1937, Poles who sent their children to private Polish schools were required to transfer children to German schools, under threat of police intervention, and attacks were carried out on Polish schools and Polish youth.<ref name=mw40/> German militias carried out numerous beatings of Polish activists, scouts and even postal workers, as "punishment" for distributing the Polish press.<ref name=mw41>Wardzyńska, p. 41</ref> German students attacked and expelled Polish students from the technical university.<ref name=mw41/> Dozens of Polish surnames were forcibly Germanized,<ref name=mw41/> while Polish symbols that reminded that for centuries Gdańsk was part of Poland were removed from the city's landmarks, such as the [[Artus Court]] and the [[Neptune's Fountain, Gdańsk|Neptune's Fountain]].<ref name=mw42>Wardzyńska, p. 42</ref>

[[NSDAP|The German government]] officially demanded the return of Danzig to Germany along with an extraterritorial (meaning under German [[jurisdiction]]) highway through the area of the [[Polish Corridor]] for land-based access from the rest of Germany. Hitler used the issue of the status of the city as a pretext for attacking Poland and in May 1939, during a high-level meeting of German military officials explained to them: "It is not Danzig that is at stake. For us it is a matter of expanding our [[Lebensraum]] in the east", adding that there will be no repeat of the Czech situation, and Germany will attack Poland at first opportunity, after isolating the country from its Western Allies.<ref>''The history of the German resistance, 1933–1945'' Peter Hoffmann p. 37 McGill-Queen's University Press 1996</ref><ref>''Hitler'' Joachim C.

[[File:Strajk sierpniowy w Stoczni Gdańskiej im. Lenina 07.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Gdańsk Shipyard]] strike in 1980]]

Boosted by heavy investment in the development of its port and three major shipyards for Soviet ambitions in the [[Baltic region]], Gdańsk became the major shipping and industrial centre of the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. In December 1970, Gdańsk was the scene of [[Polish 1970 protests|anti-regime demonstrations]], which led to the downfall of Poland's communist leader [[Władysław Gomułka]]. During the demonstrations in Gdańsk and Gdynia, military as well as the police opened fire on the demonstrators causing several dozen deaths. Ten years later, in August 1980, [[Gdańsk Shipyard]] was the birthplace of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] trade union movement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://isj.org.uk/the-rise-of-solidarnosc/ |title=The rise of Solidarnosc |last=Barker |first=Colin |date=17 October 2005 |website=International Socialism |access-date=10 December 2022 |quote=}}</ref>

In September 1981, to deter Solidarity, Soviet Union launched [[Exercise Zapad-81]], the largest military exercise in history, during which amphibious landings were conducted near Gdańsk. Meanwhile, the Solidarity held its first national congress in [[Hala Olivia]], Gdańsk when more than 800 deputies participated. Its opposition to the Communist regime led to the end of Communist Party rule in 1989, and sparked a series of protests that overthrew the Communist regimes of the former [[Eastern Bloc]].<ref name="Onet.pl">{{cite news |url=http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/trojmiasto/w-gdansku-otwarto-europejskie-centrum-solidarnosci |title=W Gdańsku otwarto Europejskie Centrum Solidarności |publisher=Onet.pl |date=31 August 2014 |access-date=7 August 2015 |language=pl |archive-date=13 December 2015 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20151213151647/http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/trojmiasto/w-gdansku-otwarto-europejskie-centrum-solidarnosci |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Solidarity's leader, [[Lech Wałęsa]], became [[President of Poland]] in 1990. In 2014 the [[European Solidarity Centre]], a museum and library devoted to the history of the movement, opened in Gdańsk.<ref name="Onet.pl"/>

On 9 July 2001, the city was flooded, with 200 million [[Polish złoty|zł]] being estimated in damage, 4 people killed, and 304 evacuated.

Gdańsk's dry winters and the precipitation maximum in summer are indicators of continentality. However seasonal extremes are less pronounced than those in inland Poland.<ref name = Weatherbase>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=5121&cityname=Gdansk%2C+Pomeranian+Voivodeship%2C+Poland&units= Gdansk] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106230835/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=5121&cityname=Gdansk%2C+Pomeranian+Voivodeship%2C+Poland&units= |date=6 November 2018 }}".

The seasons are clearly differentiated. Spring starts in March and is initially cold and windy, later becoming pleasantly warm and often increasingly sunny. Summer, which begins in June, is predominantly warm but hot at times with temperature reaching as high as {{cvt|30|to|35|C|F|0}} at least couple times a year with plenty of sunshine interspersed with heavy rain. Gdańsk averages 1,700 hours of sunshine per year. July and August are the warmest months. Autumn comes in September and is at first warm and usually sunny, turning cold, damp, and foggy in November. Winter lasts from December to March and includes periods of snow.

*Settlers from central Poland migrating voluntarily<ref name=Cordell168/>
*Non-Poles forcibly resettled during [[Operation Vistula]] in 1947. Large numbers of Ukrainians were forced to move from south-eastern Poland under a 1947 Polish government operation aimed at dispersing, and therefore assimilating, those Ukrainians who had not been expelled eastward already, throughout the newly acquired territories. Belarusians living around the area around Białystok were also pressured into relocating to the formerly German areas for the same reasons. This scattering of members of non-Polish ethnic groups throughout the country was an attempt by the Polish authorities to dissolve the unique ethnic identity of groups like the Ukrainians, Belarusians, and [[Lemkos]], and broke the proximity and communication necessary for strong communities to form.<ref>Thum, p. 129</ref>
