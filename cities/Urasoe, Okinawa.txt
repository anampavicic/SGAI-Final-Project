{{nihongo|'''Urasoe'''|浦添市|Urasoe-shi|[[Okinawan language|Okinawan]]: ''Urashii''}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] located in [[Okinawa Prefecture]], [[Japan]].  The neighboring municipalities are [[Naha]] to the south, [[Ginowan]] to the north, and [[Nishihara, Okinawa|Nishihara]] to the east. As of February 2024, the city has an estimated [[population]] of 115,518 and a [[population density]] of 6,051.2 persons per km<sup>2</sup>. The total area is 19.09&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name="pop"/>

==Etymology==
The name "Urasoe" is made up of two [[kanji]] characters. The first, {{linktext|浦}}, means "a coastal area", and the second, {{linktext|添}}, means "ruling" or "uniting". The name is a reference to "ruling over many areas".<ref name="guide" /><ref name="n" />{{needs update|date=August 2024}}

However, what appears to be an older form of this word is attested in Old Okinawan under the forms ''*uraosoi'' うらおそい and ''*uraosoe'' うらおそへ.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hokama|first=Shūzen|year=1995|title=沖縄古語大辞典|trans-title=Dictionary of Archaic Okinawan|location=Tokyo|publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten]]|page=114}}</ref>

==Geography==

Urasoe was the original capital of the Okinawan kingdom of [[Chūzan]] for several centuries until it was supplanted by [[Shuri, Okinawa|Shuri]] in the late 14th or early 15th century. [[Shunten]] (1166&ndash;1237), the first known king of the Chuzan Kingdom, located in the central region of the island of Okinawa, ruled from Urasoe, as did his son and grandson.<ref name="d"/><ref name="e"/> For much of the 14th century, [[Urasoe Castle]] was the largest on the island of Okinawa. The castle now contains the remains of several kings of the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]].<ref name="e"/><ref name="pearson"/>

Urasoe was completely razed during the [[Battle of Okinawa]] in 1945 at the end of [[World War II]]. 45% of the population, 4,117 residents, died during the battle. The village office of Urasoe was re-established in 1946 to conduct basic administrative functions, settle refugees returning to the village, and restore agricultural land.<ref name="n" /> The village saw a significant increase in U.S. military presence in 1950 in the western coast of the village, which eventually became [[Camp Kinser]]. The population of Urasoe rapidly from 1956, and the city became a bedroom community of Naha in this period.<ref name="guide"/><ref name="n"/><ref name="e"/> Urasoe was elevated to city status on July 1, 1970.<ref name="guide"/>
