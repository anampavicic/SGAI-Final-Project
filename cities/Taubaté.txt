'''Taubaté''' is a medium-sized city in the State of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], in southeastern [[Brazil]].

==History==
[[File:Great view -Taubaté, São Paulo, Brazil.jpg|thumb|left|Fielded hills surround the entirety of Taubate.]]
Taubaté was part of the ancient [[Tupinambá people|Tupinamba]] Territory, along the [[Paraiba do Sul River]].  The Tupinamba Territory in the 16th century, stretched from the [[Juqueriquerê River]] on the shores of [[Caraguatatuba]] to the Cape of Saint Thomas (Cabo de São Tomé) in the [[State of Rio de Janeiro]].  The first village was created in 1640 being proclaimed as an autonomous locality on December 5, 1645, by a pioneer named [[Jacques Felix]].  It was the first location in the [[Vale do Paraiba]] region to obtain autonomy.  The locality got its current city status in 1842.  By that time, it was one of the most important coffee production centers in the country, hosting the [[Taubaté's Agreement]] in 1906. In 1908, the city was made the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Taubaté]]. In 1900 it was the largest city in the interior of [[São Paulo]].

The county name comes from the Guarani language and means village (taba) high (ybaté).

In 1891, Taubaté was one of the first cities in Brazil to industrialize with the CTI (Companhia Taubaté Industrial), a Textile Industry.

==Education and literature==

[[File:Anfiteatro fmt.jpg|thumb|left|Inside a class room of the University of Taubate]]
[[File:Btl hangar.jpg|thumb|Taubate is home to a large Brazilian Army Aviation base.]]

Taubaté is also a university city. The [[Universidade de Taubaté|University of Taubaté]], UNITAU, is a municipal institution of higher learning run by the state, but also by the private initiative. Brazil, like France, is a country where state-owned universities are free and rank as the best, but UNITAU isn't free. UNITAU attracts young people from all over the country who come to study in one of its many colleges, such as [[Medical School]], [[Law school|Law]], [[Dentistry]], [[Engineering College|Engineering]], [[Business school|Business Management]], and also at the Department of Architecture where several alumni have excelled and won national prizes for their work, notable the Opera Prima Award.

[[Monteiro Lobato]], reputedly one of the most significant [[Portuguese language|Portuguese-language]] writer of [[Children's literature|books for children]], was born in Taubaté.  His books have been translated into many other languages, especially [[Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (novel series)|Sítio do Picapau Amarelo]], the first and one of the largest tomes in the series of twelve.

The unique way in which the narrative unfolds, gripping as they are for the many generations of children  - and adults  - who have read them, evolves in a style which can be likened to the sort of magic realism that permeates later styles of Latin American literature, and is set in rural São Paulo State where legends and myths naturally abound as the Portuguese colonial culture is fertilised by the fusion of amerindian and African cultures. The scene of his books is a fictional small farm - the Sítio do Picapau Amarelo ( loosely translated as  the  Yellow Woodpecker Estate)  owned by the central character to all of M L's books, one Dona Benta, a cultivated widow living alone in the farmlet with her black female servant Nastácia. Dona Benta's  grandchildren spend their summer holidays with her and most stories revolve around that scenario, which incidentally was inspired in M L's own property.

José Bento de Monteiro Lobato was the grandnephew of the Viscount of Tremembé, a historical figure who lived in the region of Taubaté during the second half of the 19th century, in the days when Brazil, a constitutional monarchy independent from Portugal, was an expanding economy largely dependent on its coffee plantations.

Unsurprisingly, in 06/01/10 Taubaté was granted, by the Chamber of Deputies, the title of National Capital of Children's literature.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www2.camara.leg.br/camaranoticias/noticias/EDUCACAO-E-CULTURA/148516-CAMARA-APROVA-TAUBATE-COMO-CAPITAL-NACIONAL-DA-LITERATURA-INFANTIL.html | title=Câmara aprova Taubaté como capital nacional da literatura infantil - Notícias }}</ref>

Another very important man in Taubatean and Brazilian history was [[Amácio Mazzaropi|Amacio Mazzaropi]] who was one of the pioneers in the movie industry, creating many classics that show a rural Brazil in the first half of the 20th century.
Mazzaropi embodies what might be described as a rural Brazilian stereotype, the Jeca – a dude  – whose emotions and sentiments are universal but which nevertheless reflect his immediate environment and culture. Mazzaropi the actor and film maker was himself epitomic of another influence in that part of the country: the son of Italian immigrants who falls in love with his new homeland, although, it must be said, none of his roles reflects this, since what Amacio endeavoured to portray at all times was the somewhat raw, idillyc and also very dainty environment of the coffee growing regions of his birthplace and their pretty cities in the lush tropical landscape.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by [[:pt:Companhia_Telefônica_Brasileira|Companhia Telefônica Brasileira]] until 1973, when it began to be served by [[:pt:Telecomunicações_de_São_Paulo|Telecomunicações de São Paulo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imprensaoficial.com.br/DO/BuscaDO2001Documento_11_4.aspx?link=/1973/ineditoriais/abril/24/p1/pag_0054_DUI6O3SN7V5CNe7E7ANSRTTG04F.pdf&pagina=54&data=24/04/1973&caderno=Ineditoriais&paginaordenacao=100054|title=Creation of Telesp - April 12, 1973|access-date=2024-05-27|website=www.imprensaoficial.com.br|language=Portuguese}}</ref> In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the [[Vivo (telecommunications company)|Vivo]] brand in 2012.<ref name=":vivo" />
