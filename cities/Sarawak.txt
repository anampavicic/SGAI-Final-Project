The largest among the 13 states, with an area almost equal to that of [[Peninsular Malaysia]], Sarawak is located in [[East Malaysia]] in northwest [[Borneo]], and is bordered by the Malaysian state of [[Sabah]] to the northeast, [[Kalimantan]] (the [[Indonesia]]n portion of Borneo) to the south, and [[Brunei]] in the north. The state capital, [[Kuching]], is the largest city in Sarawak, the economic centre of the state, and the seat of the Sarawak state government. Other cities and towns in Sarawak include [[Miri, Malaysia|Miri]], [[Sibu]], and [[Bintulu]]. As of the 2020 Malaysia census, the population of Sarawak was 2.453 million.<ref name="Dayak Daily"/> Sarawak has an [[equatorial climate]] with tropical [[rainforest]]s and abundant animal and plant species. It has several prominent [[cave]] systems at [[Gunung Mulu National Park]]. [[Rajang River]] is the longest river in Malaysia; [[Bakun Dam]], one of the largest dams in [[Southeast Asia]], is located on one of its tributaries, the [[Balui River]]. [[Mount Murud]] is the highest point in the state. Sarawak is the only state of Malaysia with a [[Christianity in Malaysia|Christian]] majority.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ucanews.com/amp/malaysia-christians-pray-for-peace-equality-freedom/98155 |title=Malaysia Christians pray for peace, equality, freedom - UCA News}}</ref>

The earliest known human settlement in Sarawak at the [[Niah National Park|Niah Caves]] dates back 40,000 years. A series of Chinese ceramics dated from the 8th to 13th century AD was uncovered at the archaeological site of Santubong. The coastal regions of Sarawak came under the influence of the [[Bruneian Empire]] in the 16th century. In 1839, [[James Brooke]], a British explorer, arrived in Sarawak. He, and his descendants, [[Raj of Sarawak|governed]] the state from 1841 to 1946. During [[World War II]], it was [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|occupied by the Japanese]] for three years. After the war, the last [[White Rajah]], [[Charles Vyner Brooke]], ceded Sarawak to Britain, and in 1946 it became a [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|British Crown Colony]]. On 22 July 1963, Sarawak was granted self-government by the British and subsequently became one of the founding members of Malaysia, established on 16 September 1963. However, the federation was opposed by Indonesia, leading to a three-year [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|confrontation]]. The creation of Malaysia also prompted a [[Communist insurgency in Sarawak|communist insurgency]] that lasted until 1990.

The head of state is the governor, also known as the [[Yang di-Pertua Negeri Sarawak|Yang di-Pertua Negeri]], while the head of government is the [[Premier of Sarawak|premier]]. Sarawak is divided into administrative divisions and districts, governed by a system that is closely modelled on the [[Westminster system|Westminster parliamentary system]] and was the earliest state legislature system in Malaysia. Under the Malaysian constitution, Sarawak has greater autonomy than the states in Peninsular Malaysia.

Because of its natural resources, Sarawak specialises in the export of oil and gas, [[timber]] and [[palm oil]], but also possesses strong manufacturing, energy and tourism sectors. It is ethnically, culturally, religiously and linguistically diverse; ethnic groups including Iban, Chinese, Malay, Bidayuh, Melanau, Orang Ulu, Indian, Eurasian and Kedayan.<ref>{{Cite web |title=People & Culture of Sarawak - Amazing Borneo Tours |url=https://www.amazingborneo.com/sarawak/people-culture |access-date=2023-02-20 |website=www.amazingborneo.com |language=en}}</ref> English and Malay are the two official languages of the state;<ref>{{Cite web |title=Constitution states English remains Sarawak's official language |url=http://asklegal.my/p/constitution-states-english-remains-sarawak-s-official-language |access-date=2023-02-20 |website=asklegal.my}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-12-16 |title=Premier: Unity govt agreement amended for Sarawak to use BM, English as official language |url=https://www.theborneopost.com/2022/12/16/premier-unity-govt-agreement-amended-for-sarawak-to-use-bm-english-as-official-language/ |access-date=2023-02-20 |website=Borneo Post Online |language=en-US}}</ref> there is no official religion.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-12-23 |title=PBK president suggests law on official religion in Sarawak, Sabah amended |url=https://www.theborneopost.com/2022/12/23/pbk-president-suggests-law-on-official-religion-in-sarawak-sabah-amended/ |access-date=2023-02-20 |website=Borneo Post Online |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=TAWIE |first=SULOK |date=2015-12-11 |title=Islam no more official religion on Sarawak government website |url=https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2015/12/11/islam-no-more-official-religion-on-sarawak-government-website/1021603 |access-date=2023-02-20 |website=Malay Mail |language=en}}</ref>

== Etymology ==

The generally-accepted explanation of the state's name is that it is derived from the [[Sarawak Malay]] word ''Serawak'' or Cerava by Portuguese cartographers in the 16th century, which means [[antimony]].<ref name="etymology">{{cite web |url=http://sejarahmalaysia.pnm.my/portalBI/list.php?ttl_id=35 |title=Origin of Place Names – Sarawak |publisher=[[National Library of Malaysia]] |year=2000 |access-date=3 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209105740/http://sejarahmalaysia.pnm.my/portalBI/list.php?ttl_id=35&section=sm03 |archive-date=9 February 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> A popular alternative explanation is that it is a contraction of the four Malay words purportedly uttered by Pangeran Muda Hashim (uncle to the [[Sultan of Brunei]]), "''Saya serah pada awak''" (I surrender it to you), when he gave Sarawak to [[James Brooke]], an English explorer, in 1841.<ref name="etymology"/> However, the latter explanation is incorrect: the territory had been named Sarawak before the arrival of James Brooke, and the word ''awak'' was not in the vocabulary of Sarawak Malay before the formation of Malaysia.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kris |first1=Jitab |title=Wrong info on how Sarawak got its name |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1295&dat=19910223&id=xJVUAAAAIBAJ&pg=6766,1316351&hl=en |access-date=14 November 2015 |publisher=New Sunday Times |date=23 February 1991}}</ref>

Sarawak is nicknamed "Land of the Hornbills" (''Bumi Kenyalang''). These birds are important cultural symbols for the Dayak people, representing the spirit of God. It is also believed that if a hornbill is seen flying over residences, it will bring good luck to the local community. Sarawak has eight of the world's fifty-four species of hornbills, and the [[Rhinoceros hornbill]] is the state bird of Sarawak.<ref>{{cite news |title=The magnificent hornbills of Sarawak |url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2015/07/12/the-magnificent-hornbills-of-sarawak/ |access-date=17 January 2017 |newspaper=The Borneo Post |date=12 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806050124/http://www.theborneopost.com/2015/07/12/the-magnificent-hornbills-of-sarawak/ |archive-date=6 August 2015}}</ref>

These include: control over immigration in and out of the state as well as the residence status of non-Sarawakians and Sabahans, limitations on the practice of law to resident lawyers, independence of the Sarawak High Court from the High Court Peninsular Malaysia, a requirement that the Sarawak Chief Minister be consulted prior to the appointment of the chief judge of the Sarawak High Court, the existence of Native Courts in Sarawak and the power to levy sales tax.

In 1969, the [[Sarawak state election, 1969|first Sarawak state election]] was held, with members of the Council Negri being directly elected by the voters. This election marked the beginning of ethnic [[Melanau]] domination in Sarawak politics by [[Abdul Rahman Ya'kub]] and Abdul Taib Mahmud. In the same year, the North Kalimantan Communist Party (NKCP) which subsequently waged a guerrilla war against the newly elected Sarawak state government, was formed.

Sarawak has a [[tropical geography]] with an [[tropical rainforest climate|equatorial climate]] and experiences two [[monsoon]] seasons: a northeast monsoon and a southwest monsoon. The northeast monsoon occurs between November and February, bringing heavy rainfall while the southwest monsoon, which occurs between March and October, brings somewhat less rainfall. The climate is stable throughout the year except for the two monsoons, with average daily temperature varying between {{cvt|23|C|F}} in the morning to {{cvt|32|C|F}} in the afternoon at coastal areas. [[Miri, Malaysia|Miri]] has the lowest average temperatures in comparison to other major towns in Sarawak and has the longest daylight hours (more than six hours a day), while other areas receive sunshine for five to six hours a day. Humidity is usually high, exceeding 68 per cent, with annual rainfall varying between {{cvt|330|cm|in}} and {{cvt|460|cm|in}} for up to 220 days a year.<ref name="stateplanning"/> At highland areas, the temperature can vary from {{cvt|16|C|F}} to {{cvt|25|C|F}} during the day and as low as {{cvt|11|C|F}} during the night.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Geography of Sarawak |url=http://www.sarawak.gov.my/web/home/article_view/159/176/ |website=The official website of Sarawak Government |publisher=Sarawak Government |access-date=18 June 2017}}</ref>

Sarawak is divided into three [[ecoregion]]s. The coastal region is rather low-lying and flat with large areas of swamp and other wet environments.

Sarawak can be divided into two geological zones: the [[Sunda Plate|Sunda Shield]], which extends southwest from the Batang Lupar River (near [[Simanggang|Sri Aman]]) and forms the southern tip of Sarawak, and the [[geosyncline]] region, which extends northeast to the Batang Lupar River, forming the central and northern regions of Sarawak. The oldest rock type in southern Sarawak is [[schist]] formed during the [[Carboniferous]] and [[Permian|Lower Permian]] times, while the youngest [[igneous rock]] in this region, [[andesite]], can be found at [[Sematan]]. Geological formation of the central and northern regions started during the late [[Cretaceous]] period.

Historically, Sarawak's economy was stagnant during the rule of previous three white Rajahs. After the formation of Malaysia, Sarawak GDP growth rate has risen due to increase in petroleum output and the rise in global petroleum prices.

Although the official form of Malay, [[Bahasa Malaysia]], is spoken by the government administration, it is used infrequently in colloquial conversation. The local dialect of [[Sarawak Malay|''Bahasa Sarawak'' (Sarawak Malay)]] dominates the vernacular. Bahasa Sarawak is the most common language of Sarawak Malays and other indigenous tribes. The Iban language, which has minor regional variations, is the most widely spoken native language, with 60 per cent of the Sarawak population speaking it as a first language. The Bidayuh language, with six major dialects, is spoken by 10 per cent of the population. The Orang Ulu have about 30 different language dialects. While the ethnic Chinese originate from a variety of backgrounds and speak many different Southern Chinese languages such as Cantonese, Hokkien, Hakka, Fuzhou, and Teochew, they also converse in [[Malaysian Mandarin]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Sarawak, a land of many tongues |url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2010/12/23/sarawak-a-land-of-many-tongues/ |access-date=7 January 2016 |newspaper=The Borneo Post |date=23 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151113120315/http://www.theborneopost.com/2010/12/23/sarawak-a-land-of-many-tongues/ |archive-date=13 November 2015}}</ref> [[Tamil language]] is spoken by the Indians in Sarawak.

The location and history of Sarawak has resulted in a broad diversity of ethnicity, culture and languages. Among the indigenous peoples of Sarawak, outside influences have led to many changes over time. The Iban tribal culture in Sarawak centred on the concept of the warrior and the ability to take heads from other tribes in battle. This practice, central as it was to the Iban people, was made illegal under James Brooke's rule and ultimately faded away although reminders of the practice are still seen in some long houses.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Metom |first1=Lily |title=Emotion Concepts of the Ibans in Sarawak |date=31 January 2013 |publisher=Patridge Singapore |isbn=978-1-4828-9731-9 |page=22 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cX3XAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA22 |access-date=12 January 2016 |quote=Nevertheless, all these ancient customs pertaining to headhunting are no longer observed in these modern days.}}</ref> Two other tribal peoples of the Sarawak Highlands, the Kelabit and Lun Bawang, have seen fundamental changes to their ethnic identities as a direct result of their conversion to Christianity.

In the years before federation, the colonial government recognised that British education and indigenous culture was influencing a new generation of Iban teachers. Thus, on 15 September 1958, the Borneo Literature Bureau was inaugurated with a charter to nurture and encourage local literature while also supporting the government in its release of documentation, particularly in technical and instructional manuscripts that were to be distributed to the indigenous peoples of Sarawak and Sabah. As well as indigenous languages, documents would also be published in English, Chinese and Malay. In 1977, the bureau came under the authority of the federal government language planning and development agency, the [[Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka]] (DBP), which advocated publication only in Malay ultimately causing the demise of fledgling indigenous literature.<ref name=Ibanmalaysian/><ref group=note>Postill, 2006; ... to encourage local authorship and meet local needs&nbsp;...

It was a number of decades before print media began to appear in Sarawak. The ''[[Sarawak Gazette]]'', published by the Brooke government, recorded a variety of news relating to economics, agriculture, anthropology, archaeology, began circulation in 1870 and continues in modern times.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sarawak Gazette now available online |url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2013/07/31/sarawak-gazette-now-available-online/ |access-date=5 January 2016 |newspaper=The Borneo Post |date=31 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202403/http://www.theborneopost.com/2013/07/31/sarawak-gazette-now-available-online |archive-date=9 May 2015}}</ref>
