Situated in the [[Central Italy|central peninsular section]] of the country, it has 5,714,882 inhabitants and a GDP of more than €212 billion per year, making it the country's second most populated region<ref name=pop/> and second largest regional economy after [[Lombardy]]. The capital of Lazio is [[Rome]], which is also the capital and [[Largest Cities in Italy|largest city]] of Italy, and completely encircles [[Vatican City]].

Lazio is rich in a multi-millennial heritage: it was the home of the [[Etruscan civilization]], then stood at the center of the [[Roman Republic]], of the [[Roman Empire]], of the [[Papal States]], of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] and of the [[Italian Republic]]. The historical, artistic, cultural, architectural, archaeological and religious heritage of Lazio is immensely vast and rich in cultural diversity. Some of the greatest artists and historical figures lived and worked in Rome, particularly during the [[Italian Renaissance]] period, such as [[Donato Bramante]], [[Raphael]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], [[Donatello]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Caravaggio]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], [[Francesco Borromini]], [[Pietro da Cortona]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Anthony van Dyck]] and [[Diego Velázquez]].

In remote antiquity, Lazio (''[[Latium]]'') included only a limited part of the current region, between the lower course of the [[Tiber]], the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], the [[Monti Sabini]] and the [[Pontine Marshes]].<ref>{{Treccani|latium-et-campania_%28Enciclopedia-dell%27-Arte-Antica%29/|Latium et Campania|language=it}}</ref>

At the end of the [[World War II]] and the fall of the [[Fascist Italy|Fascist regime]], from the end of the 1950s Lazio and Italy saw [[Italian economic miracle|rapid economic growth]], in particular in Rome it is remembered as the period of the "[[:it:Dolce vita (periodo)|Dolce Vita]]" in which Rome was the fulcrum of worldly life, of the new [[consumer society]], the desire for life, beauty and entertainment exploded, becoming the "''[[Hollywood on the Tiber]]''".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/jewellery-watches/a30101641/hollywood-in-rome/|title=Hollywood in Rome|website=harpersbazaar.com|date=9 December 2019}}</ref> Today, Lazio is a large center of [[Tertiary sector of the economy|services]] and [[international trade]], [[industry (economics)|industry]], [[public services]] and [[tourism]], supported by an extensive network of [[Transport in Italy|transport infrastructures]] thanks to its geographical position in the center of [[Italian Peninsula]] and the presence of Rome within it.

== Geography ==
[[File:Lazio SRTM.png|thumb|left|Relief map of Lazio]]
[[File:Vallée de l'Aniene et Monts Prénestiens.JPG|thumb|left|Panorama of the [[Aniene]] Valley]]
[[File:Circeo.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Circeo National Park]] seen from [[Sabaudia]] beach]]

Lazio comprises a land area of {{convert|17,242|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and it has borders with [[Tuscany]], [[Umbria]], and [[Marche]] to the north, [[Abruzzo]] and [[Molise]] to the east, [[Campania]] to the south, and the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] to the west. The region is mainly hilly (56%) and mountainous (26%), with some plains (20%) along the coast and the Tiber valley.

The coast of Lazio is mainly composed of sandy beaches, punctuated by the headlands of [[Cape Circeo]] (541 m) and [[Gaeta]] (171 m). The [[Pontine Islands]], which are part of Lazio, are off Lazio's southern coast. Behind the coastal strip, to the north, lies the [[Maremma]] Laziale (the continuation of the Tuscan Maremma), a coastal plain interrupted at [[Civitavecchia]] by the [[Tolfa Mountains]] (616 m). The central section of the region is occupied by the [[Roman Campagna]], a vast [[alluvial plain]] surrounding the city of Rome, with an area of approximately {{convert|2100|km2|0|abbr=on}}. The southern districts are characterized by the flatlands of [[Agro Pontino]], a once swampy and [[malaria]]l area, that was [[land reclamation|reclaimed]] over the centuries.

The [[Preapennines]] of Latium, marked by the [[Tiber Valley]] and the [[Liri]] with the [[Sacco River|Sacco]] tributary, include on the right of the Tiber, three groups of mountains of volcanic origin: the [[Volsini]], [[Monti Cimini|Cimini]] and [[Monti Sabatini|Sabatini]], whose largest former craters are occupied by the [[Lake Bolsena|Bolsena]], [[Lake Vico|Vico]] and [[Lake Bracciano|Bracciano]] lakes. To the south of the Tiber, other mountain groups form part of the Preapennines: the [[Alban Hills]], also of volcanic origin, and the calcareous [[Monti Lepini|Lepini]], [[Ausoni Mountains|Ausoni]] and [[Aurunci Mountains]]. The Apennines of Latium are a continuation of the Apennines of Abruzzo: the Reatini Mountains with [[Terminillo]] (2,213 m), Mounts Sabini, [[Monti Prenestini|Prenestini]], [[Monti Simbruini|Simbruini]] and [[Monti Ernici|Ernici]] which continue east of the Liri into the [[Mainarde Mountains]]. The highest peak is Mount Gorzano (2,458 m) on the border with Abruzzo.

=== Climate ===

The region's [[climate]], monitored by several dozen meteorological stations (many of which managed by the Lazio Regional Hydrographic and Mareographic Office), shows considerable variability from area to area. In general, along the [[coast]], there is a [[mediterranean climate]], the temperature values vary between {{convert|9|–|10|C|F}} in January and {{convert|24|–|25|C|F}} in July.
Towards the interior, the climate is more [[Continental climate|continental]] and, on the hills, winters are cold and at night, temperatures can be quite frigid.

With particular regard to the [[sunshine duration]], it should also be noted that, among the regional capital cities in Italy, Rome is the one with the highest number of hours of [[sunshine]] and days with clear skies during the year.

== History ==
{{For|the history of ancient Lazio|Latium}}{{see also|List of museums in Lazio}}
[[File:RomaViaAppiaAntica03.JPG|thumb|The [[Appian Way]] (''Via Appia''), a road connecting [[Ancient Rome]] to the southern parts of Italy, remains usable even today.]]

The Italian word Lazio descends from the Latin word [[Latium]], the region of the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]], ''Latini'' in the Latin language spoken by them and passed on to the Latin city-state of [[Rome|Ancient Rome]]. Although the demography of ancient Rome was [[Multinational state|multi-ethnic]], including, for example, Etruscans, Sabines and other [[Italic peoples|Italics]] besides the Latini, the latter were the dominant constituent. In [[Roman mythology]], the tribe of the Latini took their name from King [[Latinus]]. Apart from the mythical derivation of Lazio given by the ancients as the place where [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], ruler of the [[golden age]] in Latium, hid (latuisset)<ref>''Aeneid'', VIII.323.</ref> from Jupiter there,<ref>{{cite book |title=The student's manual of ancient geography |url=https://archive.org/details/studentsmanuala00smitgoog |first1=William Latham |last1=Bevan |first2=William |last2=Smith |location=London |publisher=J. Murray |year=1875 |pages=530–531}}</ref> a major modern etymology is that Lazio comes from the Latin word "latus", meaning "wide",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/latin|title=latin &#124; Origin and meaning of the name latin |website=Online Etymology Dictionary }}</ref> expressing the idea of "flat land" meaning the [[Roman Campagna]]. Much of Lazio is in fact flat or rolling. The lands originally inhabited by the Latini were extended into the territories of the [[Samnites]], the [[Marsi]], the [[Hernici]], the [[Aequi]], the [[Aurunci]] and the [[Volsci]], all surrounding Italic tribes. This larger territory was still called Latium, but it was divided into [[Latium adiectum]] or Latium Novum, the added lands or New Latium, and Latium Vetus, or Old Latium, the older, smaller region. The northern border of Lazio was the [[Tiber]] river, which divided it from [[Etruria]].

The emperor [[Augustus]] officially united almost all of present-day Italy into a single geo-political entity, [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italia]], dividing it into eleven regions. The part of today's Lazio south of the Tiber river – together with the present region of [[Campania]] immediately to the southeast of Lazio and the seat of [[Naples|Neapolis]] – became Region I (''Latium et Campania''), while modern [[Province of Viterbo|Upper Lazio]] became part of ''Regio VII – Etruria'', and today's [[Province of Rieti]] joined ''Regio IV – Samnium''.

After [[Kingdom of Italy (Ostrogothic)#Conquest of Italy by the Goths .28488.E2.80.93493.29|the Gothic conquest of Italy]] at the end of the fifth century, modern Lazio became part of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]], but after the [[Gothic War (535-554)|Gothic War between 535 and 554]] and conquest by the [[Byzantine Empire]], the region became the property of the Eastern Emperor as the [[Duchy of Rome]]. However, the long wars against the [[Longobards]] weakened the region. With the [[Donation of Sutri]] in 728, the [[Pope]] acquired the first territory in the region beyond the Duchy of Rome.

The strengthening of the religious and ecclesiastical aristocracy led to continuous power struggles between secular lords (''[[Baron]]i'') and the Pope until the middle of the 16th century. [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] tried to strengthen his own territorial power, wishing to assert his authority in the provincial administrations of Tuscia, Campagna and Marittima through the Church's representatives, in order to reduce the power of the [[Colonna family]]. Other popes tried to do the same. During the period when the papacy resided in [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon, France]] (1309–1377), the feudal lords' power increased due to the absence of the Pope from Rome. Small communes, and Rome above all, opposed the lords' increasing power, and with [[Cola di Rienzo]], they tried to present themselves as antagonists of the ecclesiastical power. However, between 1353 and 1367, the papacy regained control of Lazio and the rest of the [[Papal States]]. From the middle of the 16th century, the papacy politically unified Lazio with the Papal States,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/601-bigger-than-you-think-the-vatican-and-its-annexes|title=Bigger Than You Think: the Vatican and its Annexes|last=Jacobs|first=Frank|work=Big Think|access-date=2018-06-25}}</ref> so that these territories became provincial administrations of St. Peter's estate; governors in [[Viterbo]], in Marittima and [[Campagna]], and in [[Frosinone]] administered them for the papacy.

Lazio was part of the short-lived [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]], after which it became a [[puppet state]] of the [[First French Republic]] under the forces of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. Lazio was returned to the Papal States in October 1799. In 1809, it was annexed to the French Empire under the name of the [[Rome (department)|Department of Tibre]], but returned to the Pope's control in 1815.

On 20 September 1870 the [[capture of Rome]], during the reign of Pope [[Pius IX]], and France's defeat at [[Battle of Sedan|Sedan]], completed [[Italian unification]], and Lazio was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. In 1927, the territory of the province of Rieti, belonging to [[Umbria]] and [[Abruzzo]], joined Lazio. Towns in Lazio were devastated by the [[August 2016 Central Italy earthquake|2016 Central Italy earthquake]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/25/world/europe/italy-earthquake.html Powerful Earthquakes in Italy].</ref>

== Economy ==
[[File:Palazzo Eni (Rome) in 2021.02.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of [[Eni]] in [[EUR, Rome|EUR]], [[Rome]]]]
Agriculture, crafts, animal husbandry and fishery are the main traditional sources of income. Agriculture is characterized by the cultivation of wine grapes, fruit, vegetables and olives. Lazio is the main growing region of [[Kiwifruit|kiwi]] in Italy.

Approximately 73% of the working population are employed in the services sector, which contribute 85.8% of regional GDP; this is a considerable proportion, but is justified by the presence of Rome, which is the core of public administration, media, utility, telecommunication, transport, tourism and other sectors. Many national and multinational corporations, public and private, have their headquarters in Rome ([[Eni|ENI]], [[Anonima Petroli Italiana|Italiana Petroli]], [[Enel]], [[Acea (company)|Acea]], [[Terna Group|Terna]], [[Gruppo TIM|TIM]], [[Poste italiane]], [[Leonardo S.p.A.|Leonardo]], [[ITA Airways]], [[Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane]], [[RAI]]).

Lazio's limited industrial sector and highly developed service industries allowed the region to well outperform the Italian economy in 2009 in the heart of the global financial crisis, but it was strongly affected by the [[COVID-19]] crisis of 2020–2021 due to the lock-downs.

Industrial development in Lazio is limited to the areas south of Rome. Communications and – above all – the setting of the border of the [[Cassa per il Mezzogiorno|Cassa del Mezzogiorno]] some kilometers south of Rome have influenced the position of industry, favouring the areas with the best links to Rome and those near the [[Autostrada A1 (Italy)|Autostrada del Sole]], especially around [[Frosinone]]. Additional factor was cheap energy supply from [[Latina Nuclear Power Plant]] and [[Garigliano Nuclear Power Plant]], which are now out of the operation after Italian nuclear energy referendum.

[[File:Calc%C3%A1reo_Travertino1.jpg|thumbnail|[[Travertine]]]]

Industry contributes a small part of GDP: its share is 8.9% compared to 25.0% in [[Veneto]] and 24.0% in [[Emilia-Romagna]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://dati.istat.it/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=DCCN_PILPRODT |title=Prodotto interno lordo lato produzione – dati territoriali (milioni di euro) – edizioni precedenti ottobre 2014<!-- Titolo generato automaticamente --> |access-date=26 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503131905/http://dati.istat.it/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=DCCN_PILPRODT |archive-date=3 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> In [[Rome]] it is even less with 7%, compared with 12% from tourism. Since a large part of Lazio's GDP is produced by the [[service sector]], with high [[value added]].

Firms are often small to medium in size and operate in the 
* oil refining ([[Gaeta]])
* automobile ([[Alfa Romeo Cassino Plant|Cassino Plant]], which produced 53,422 [[Alfa Romeo]] cars in 2020 and has 3,433 employees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.startmag.it/smartcity/stellantis-cosa-succedera-agli-stabilimenti-fca-di-torino-pomigliano-e-melfi/|title=Stellantis Report 2020|date=11 January 2021|language=it}}</ref>)

* building and building materials ([[Rome]], [[Civitavecchia]])
**Well-developed [[travertine]]-processing industry, especially in the Ausoni-Tiburtina area ([[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]] and [[Guidonia Montecelio]] quarries).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iltravertino.com/|title=Societa del Travertino Romano|language=it}}</ref> 
**ca. 70% of the national sanitary ceramics comes from [[Civita Castellana]] industrial district and [[Gaeta]] 
* textile ([[:it:Distretto tessile della Valle del Liri|Valle del Liri]]). In the district the production relationships are mostly of the subcontractor type, 40% of the companies produce semi-finished and finished products not intended for marketing.

There is some R&D activity in [[high technology]]: [[IBM]] ([[IBM Rome Software Lab]]), [[Ericsson]], [[Leonardo S.p.A.|Leonardo Electronics]] (Rome-Tiburtina, Rome-Laurentina, [[Pomezia]], [[Latina, Lazio|Latina]]),<ref name="Leo1">{{cite web|url=https://www.leonardocompany.com/en/global/europe/italy|title=Leonardo locations in Italy|access-date=2021-05-14|archive-date=2021-06-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210628055214/https://www.leonardocompany.com/en/global/europe/italy|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Rheinmetall]] ("Radar House") and tire industry: [[Bridgestone]] (R&D center in [[Rome]] and proving grounds in [[Aprilia, Lazio|Aprilia]]).

===Consumer goods===
The most distinctive industry in Lazio is production of household chemicals, pharmaceutical, hygiene goods and medical products: [[Sigma-Tau]], [[Johnson & Johnson]], [[Procter & Gamble]], [[Colgate Palmolive]], [[Henkel]], [[Pfizer]], [[Abbott Laboratories|Abbott]], [[Catalent]], [[Angelini]], [[Menarini]], Biopharma, [[Wepa (company)|Wepa]].

===Space===

From fruits the most important are [[kiwifruit]] (1st place in Italy) and [[Corylus avellana|hazel nuts]] "Nocciola romana". Italy itself is the second largest producer of kiwifruit worldwide and was surpassed only by [[China]]. Infrastructure which has been used for grape growing was easily adapted for kiwifruit cultivation.

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Roman cuisine}}

One of the most famous forms of food in Lazio is [[pasta]]. Dishes first attested inside the region's borders include:
<gallery>
Spaghetti_carbonara.jpg|''[[Carbonara|Spaghetti alla carbonara]]''
Bucatini_allamatriciana.jpg|''[[Amatriciana sauce|Bucatini all'amatriciana]]''
Pizzeria_Bella_Italia_%28Cr%C3%A9pieux-la-Pape%29_-_Penne_all%27arabiata_%282%29_%28f%C3%A9vrier_2020%29.jpg|''[[Arrabbiata sauce|Penne all'arrabbiata]]''
Pasta_alla_Gricia.jpg|''[[Pasta alla gricia|Spaghetti alla gricia]]''
</gallery>
''[[Guanciale]]'' is used in several sauces. ''Guanciale'' is the cut of pork obtained from the cheek of the pig, crossed by lean veins of muscle with a component of valuable fat, of a composition different from ''[[lardo]]'' ("back fat") and ''[[pancetta]]'' ("belly fat"): the consistency is harder than ''pancetta'' and it possesses a more distinctive flavor. ''Guanciale'' is salted pork fat, different from [[bacon]], which is smoked. It is a typical product of Lazio, [[Umbria]] and [[Abruzzo]]. Another important ingredient is [[Pecorino romano|''pecorino romano'' cheese]].

Vegetables are common, [[artichoke]]s ("''carciofi''") being among the most popular:
<gallery>

</gallery>

Other popular vegetables are [[romanesco broccoli]], [[asparagus]], [[Vicia faba|fava bean]], ''[[:it:Cima di rapa|cima di rapa]]'', [[romaine lettuce]], [[pumpkin]], [[zucchini]] and [[chicory]].

=== Spices ===

In the cuisine of Lazio, spices are widely used. Among the most used are [[Nepeta nepetella|lesser cat-mint]], called in Rome "''mentuccia''" (for artichokes and mushrooms), [[Mentha pulegium|squaw mint]], called in Rome "''menta romana''" (for lamb and tripe), [[List of plants known as laurel|laurel]], [[rosemary]], [[Salvia officinalis|sage]], [[juniper]], [[chili pepper|chili]] and grated [[truffle]].

=== ''Quinto quarto'' ===

Although Roman and Lazio cuisine use cheap ingredients like vegetable and pasta, poor people needed a source of protein. Therefore, they used the so-called ''"quinto quarto"'' ("fifth quarter"), leftovers from animal carcasses that remained after the sale of prized parts to the wealthy.

''Quinto quarto'' includes tripe (the most valuable part of [[Reticulum (anatomy)|reticulum]], also called "''cuffia''", "''l'omaso''" or "''lampredotto''"), kidneys (which need to be soaked for a long time in water with lemon to remove urine smell), heart, liver, spleen, sweetbreads (pancreas, thymus and salivary glands), brain, tongue, ox tail, trotters and pajata ([[intestines]] of calf, fed only with its mother's milk). The intestines are cleaned and skinned but the [[chyme]] (mass of partly digested food) is left inside. Typical dishes of this style are:

Trippa_Alla_Romana.jpg|''[[Trippa alla romana]]''
Lampredotto_sandwich.JPG|[[Lampredotto|Lampredotto sandwich]]
Coda_alla_vaccinara-01.jpg|''[[Coda alla vaccinara]]''
</gallery>

=== Meat dishes ===
Traditional meat dishes include ''[[Saltimbocca|saltimbocca alla romana]]'' (veal wrapped with ''[[Prosciutto|prosciutto di Parma]]'' [[Prosciutto|DOP]] and [[Salvia officinalis|sage]] and cooked in white wine, butter and flour) and ''[[Abbacchio|abbacchio alla romana]]'' (roasted lamb with garlic, rosemary, pepper and chopped ''[[prosciutto]]'').

The region gives its name to the professional [[Association football|football]] club [[SS Lazio]] that plays in the Italian [[Serie A]]. The region has two professional clubs in the top flight, the other being [[AS Roma]], who also play in the highest division of Italian football. Combined, the two have won [[List of Italian football champions|five Italian championships]] with Roma winning three and Lazio two. The main sports stadium in Lazio is [[Stadio Olimpico]] in Rome which has housed both teams for a prolonged time and hosts [[Derby della Capitale]] between the two clubs. The stadium also hosted the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] and the [[1990 FIFA World Cup final]]. Outside of Rome the football scene has another club playing in the Serie A, that being [[Frosinone Calcio|Frosinone]].

Lazio hosts no top-line motorsports events, but the [[Vallelunga Circuit|Vallelunga]] circuit previously hosted the [[Superbike World Championship]] in [[motorcycle racing]].

Rome is home to many international sporting events and competitions, including:
* [[Italian Open (tennis)|Italian Open]] ''Internazionali d'Italia'', which take place between April and May of each year at the [[Foro Italico]];
* [[Rome ePrix]], the [[Formula E]] championship, has been held on the [[Circuito Cittadino dell'EUR]] since 2018;
* [[Six Nations Championship]]: the home matches of the [[Italy national rugby union team|Italian national rugby team]];
* International horse show "Piazza di Siena", equestrian competition held since 1922 in piazza di Siena, inside [[Villa Borghese gardens|Villa Borghese]];
