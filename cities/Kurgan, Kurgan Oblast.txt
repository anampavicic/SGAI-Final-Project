Population: {{ru-census|p2021=310,911|p2010= 333,606|p2002= 345,515|p1989= 355,517}}.{{Historical populations|1897|10306|1926|27996|1939|53253|1959|145712|1970|243850|1979|309863|1989|355517|2002|345515|2010|333606|2021|310911|type=|footnote=Source: Census data}}

Until 1782, Kurgan bore the name ''Tsaryovo Gorodishche''.

==History==
[[File:Курган, троицкая улица, 1-ая часть.jpg|thumb|Kurgan in the 1850s]]

An urban settlement was established here between 1659 and 1662 as '''Tsaryovo Gorodishche''' ({{lang|ru|Царёво Городи́ще}}, meaning ''Imperial Citadel'') by Timofey Nevezhin, a farmer from [[Tyumen]].{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} In the ensuing years it was developed as a fortress town. It served as a frontier post and its fortified position enabled it to defend other Russian settlements from nomad attacks. Nevertheless, it was itself not always able to withstand such attacks, and was sometimes plundered and burnt down.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

The city was granted [[Town privileges|city privileges]] by [[Catherine the Great|the Empress Catherine the Great]] in 1782, which is when it acquired its present name and became the seat of an [[uyezd]].{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} The present name is taken from a large [[Kurgan|kurgan (burial mound)]] close to the original settlement.

Its coat of arms was granted on 17 March 1785, and it became the administrative center of Kurgan Oblast in 1943.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} Kurgan was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]] in 1982.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}
