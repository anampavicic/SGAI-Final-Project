==History==
The area around present-day Ichikawa has been inhabited since the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period. Archaeologists have found [[stone tool]]s dating to some 30,000 years ago. Numerous [[shell midden]]s from the [[Jōmon period]], and hundreds of [[kofun|burial tumuli]] from the [[Kofun period]] have been found in numerous locations around Ichikawa. During the [[Nara period]], Ichikawa was the provincial capital of [[Shimōsa Province]] and is mentioned in the ''[[Man'yōshū]]''.  During the [[Heian period]], this area was the center of the rebellion by [[Taira Masakado]].  During the [[Sengoku period]], it was the site of a major battles ([[Battle of Kōnodai (1538)|Battle of Kōnodai]]) between the [[Satomi clan]] and the [[Later Hōjō clan]].

In more recent history, the area was also the site of some minor battles during the [[Boshin War]] of the [[Meiji Restoration]] and was promoted as a possible site for the new [[Diet of Japan]] by [[Katsu Kaishu]], who envisioned a structure to be built on the [[Edogawa River]] similar to the [[Houses of Parliament]] in [[London]] along the [[River Thames]]. Ichikawa Town was organized in 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. On November 3, 1934 Ichikawa merged with the neighboring towns of Yawata, Nakayama and village of Kokubun to form the city of Ichikawa. The city expanded by annexing the village of Okashiwa on November 3, 1949, the town of Gyotoku on March 31, 1955 and town of Minami-Gyotoku on October 1, 1956.

==Government==
Ichikawa has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 42 members. Ichikawa contributes six members to the Chiba Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between the [[Chiba 5th district]] and the [[Chiba 6th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Ichikawa during the [[Meiji period]] was considered a desirable location for politicians, industrialists and many cultural figures, and had the highest assessed land prices in Chiba Prefecture. Many modern writers and poets have either lived in Ichikawa, or had written works set in Ichikawa, including [[Soseki Natsume]], [[Shiki Masaoka]], [[Akiko Yosano]], [[Yukio Mishima]], [[Nagai Kafu]], [[Hisashi Inoue]] and [[Koda Rohan]]. The area around [[Ichikawa Station]] and [[Motoyawata Station]] later developed into  a commercial area with many high-rise condominiums, commercial facilities, and companies. The area around Motoyawata Station is also an administrative center where many city facilities such as the city hall are located.

The Gyotoku district in the south is an area which once had [[salt evaporation pond|salt pans]] in the Edo Period, but was transformed in modern times into [[new town]] developments with good access to Tokyo via the [[Tokyo Metro]] [[Tokyo Metro Tōzai Line|Tozai Line]]. The bay area along the Keiyo Line and [[Japan National Route 357]] (Metropolitan Expressway Bayshore Line / [[Higashi Kanto Expressway]]) is an industrial area as part of the Tokyo-Chiba industrial zone, and is a distribution base where factories and warehouses of various companies are lined up.
