'''Sukabumi''' ({{langx|su|{{Sund|ᮞᮥᮊᮘᮥᮙᮤ}}}}) is a landlocked city surrounded by the [[Sukabumi Regency|regency of the same name]] (within which it is an [[enclave and exclave|enclave]]) in the southern foothills of [[Mount Gede]], in [[West Java]], [[Indonesia]], about {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the national capital, [[Jakarta]].

At an altitude of approximately {{convert|584|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the city is a minor [[hill station]] resort, with a cooler climate than the surrounding lowlands. The area around Sukabumi is also a popular destination for [[whitewater rafting]]. [[Tea]] and [[Rubber]] production is a major industry in the area.  The suburban area surrounding Sukabumi circling the mountain has grown tremendously in population, such that northern [[Sukabumi Regency]], hugging the volcano, and bordering [[Greater Jakarta]], is home to the bulk of the [[Sukabumi Regency|regency]]'s population.  

The area of the city is 48.31&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, and the population at the 2010 Census was 300,359,<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> while the 2020 Census was 346,325;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 364,914.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Sukabumi Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.3272)</ref> However, some 1.8 million people, as of the 2010 census figures, live in the surrounding metropolitan area within Sukabum1 Regency, notably in Cisaat and Gunung Guruh Districts to the west of the city and Kebonpedes District to the east. The bulk of the metropolitan area population is unusual in that it forms a narrow southwest ring around Mount Gede.  The eastern portion of the ringed population belt continues on into [[Cianjur Regency]].

==History==
===Early history===
The area around Sukabumi was already inhabited at least in the 11th century. The first written record found in this area was the [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]] in Cibadak, 20&nbsp;km west of the city. Written in [[Kawi script]], the stone tells about the prohibition of fishing activity in the nearby river by the authorities of the [[Sunda Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite book|author= [[Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro]], [[Nugroho Notosusanto]]|title= Sejarah nasional Indonesia: Jaman kuna|chapter=Kerajaan Sunda|publisher=PT Balai Pustaka|year=1992|isbn= 978-979-407-408-4|page=376}}</ref>

At the end of the 16th century, the area was captured by the [[Banten Sultanate]], after the fall of the [[Sunda Kingdom]]. The area however became contested in the 1620s between Banten, the [[Mataram Sultanate]] in the east and the [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]]-based [[Dutch East India Company]]. After a series of military clashes between them, the area was included in a buffer zone territory between Banten and Mataram, although the area is considered ''de jure'' as a part of Mataram.<ref>{{cite book|author= G. G. Bandilenko, E.I. Gnevusheva, D.V. Deopik, V.A. Tsyganov|title= History of Indonesia|year=1992|pages=175–179}}</ref>

In 1677, after the Dutch forced Mataram to sign a series of unequal treaties as a consequence of Dutch assistance for quelling the [[Trunajaya rebellion]], Sukabumi came under direct control of [[Cianjur Regency|Tjiandjoer]].<ref name="Sajarah Cianjur">{{cite book|last=Suryaningrat|first=Bayu|year=1982|title=Sajarah Cianjur Sareng Raden Aria Wira Tanu Dalem Cikundul Cianjur|publisher=Rukun Warga Cianjur-Jakarta, Jakarta}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author= G. G. Bandilenko, E.I. Gnevusheva, D.V. Deopik, V.A. Tsyganov|title= History of Indonesia|year=1992|pages=201–202}}</ref> By that time, there were only few rural Sundanese settlements existed, one of the largest was Tjikole.<ref>{{cite book|author= Jaya, Ruyatna|title= Sejarah Sukabumi|publisher=Sukabumi City Government|year= 2003|page=8}}</ref>

===Colonial Sukabumi===
====Sukabumi Coffee Plantations====
The area around the present-day Sukabumi (or Soekaboemi in [[Van Ophuijsen Spelling System]]) began to develop in the 18th century when the [[Dutch East India Company]] started to open coffee plantation areas in the western [[Priangan]] region of [[Java]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Beekman |first=E. M. |date=1988 |title=Fugitive Dreams: An Anthology of Dutch Colonial Literature |publisher=University of Massachusetts Press |page=90 |isbn=0870235753}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Brommer |first=Bea |date=2015 |title=To My Dear Pieternelletje:Grandfather and Granddaughter in VOC Time, 1710–1720 |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |page=19 |isbn=9789004293328}}</ref> Due to the high demands of coffee in Europe, in the year of 1709 the [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies|Dutch governor-general]] [[Abraham van Riebeeck]] started to open coffee plantations around the area of Tjibalagoeng (present-day [[Bogor]]), [[Cianjur, Cianjur Regency|Tjiandjoer]], Djogdjogan, Pondok Kopo, and Goenoeng Goeroeh.<ref>{{cite book |last=Danasasmita |first=Saleh |date=1983 |title=Sejarah Bogor, Volume 1 |location=Bogor |publisher=Pemerintah Daerah Kotamadya DT II Bogor |page=85 }}</ref> Coffee plantations in these five areas had then undergone expansion and intensification during the era of [[Hendrick Zwaardecroon]] (1718–1725), where the Tjiandjoer regent at that time [[Wiratanu III|Wira Tanoe III]] acquired territorial expansion of [[Cianjur Regency|his regency]] as a compensation for more coffee plantations openings.<ref>{{cite book |last=Klaveren |first=N. A. |date=1983 |title=The Dutch Colonial System in the East Indies |publisher=Springer |page=60 |isbn=9789401768481}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Kumar |first=Ann |date=1997 |title=Java and Modern Europe: Ambiguous Encounters |publisher=Routledge |page=292 |isbn=1138863149}}</ref>

The growth of Goenoeng Goeroeh coffee plantation led to the establishment of small settlements around its area, one of those was the Tjikole (Cikole) hamlet, named after the nearby Tjikole River. In 1776, regent of Tjiandjoer Wira Tanoe Datar VI established the Tjikole Viceregency which were the indirect predecessor of the present-day Sukabumi Regency.<ref>{{cite book |last=Coolsma |first=S. |date=2010 |title=De zendingseeuw voor Neederlandsch Oost-Indië |publisher=Nabu Press |page=118 |isbn=9781174732164}}</ref> The viceregency consisted of six districts of Djampang Koelon, Djampang Tengah, Goenoeng Parang, Tjiheoelang, Tjimahi, and Tjitjoeroeg. The administrative center was located in Tjikole, due to its very strategic locations for communications between [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] and Tjiandjoer which were the capital of the [[Priangan Residency]] at that time.<ref>{{cite book |last=MPI Foundation |date=2005 |title=West Java Miracle Sight: A Mass of Verb and Scene Information |page=724 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Marihandono |first=Djoko |date=2008 |title=Titik balik historiografi di Indonesia |publisher=University of Indonesia |page=217 |isbn=9789793258805}}</ref>

====Tjikole becomes Soekaboemi====
[[File:Andries de Wilde.jpg|thumb|Andries de Wilde proposed the renaming of Tjikole to Soekaboemi to the [[Stamford Raffles|Raffles]] administration|alt=|left|160x160px]]
After the Dutch East Indies were under the rule of the [[British Empire|British]] in 1811, vast lands in the Tjikole area were bought by [[Stamford Raffles]], the [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies]] at that time, via an auction held in Batavia.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bosma |first=Ulbe |date=2009 |title=Being "Dutch" in the Indies: A History of Creolisation and Empire, 1500–1920 |publisher=Ohio University Press |page=97 |isbn=9789971693732}}</ref> The name Soekaboemi was first used on 1815, when a Priangan-based plantation owner (known then as ''Preanger Planter'') and surgeon, [[Andries Christoffel Johannes de Wilde|Andries de Wilde]] visited Tjikole in 1814. From his consultations with local people, De Wilde wrote a letter to Nicolaus Engelhard, a friend and plantation investor, where de Wilde asked Engelhard to propose a [[Geographical renaming|name change]] of the viceregency from Tjikole to Soekaboemi, to which Raffles agreed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dutch East Indies. Topografische Dienst |date=1918 |title=Jaarverslag |page=202 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Dinas Pariwisata Provinsi Daerah Tingkat I Jawa Barat |date=1986 |title=Wajah Pariwisata Jawa Barat |location=Bandung |publisher=Dinas Pariwisata Jawa Barat |page=178 |isbn=9789798075001}}</ref>

In Dutch colonial times, Soekaboemi was the site of the ''Politieschool'', the colonial [[police academy]]. On 8 December 1941, the Empire of Japan [[Dutch East Indies campaign|invaded the Dutch East Indies]] as part of [[World War II]] and on 6 March 1942, the city came under [[Bombing of Sukabumi|aerial bombardment]] by Japanese aircraft. During this attack, both civilian targets (including houses and two schools) and strategic targets (the police academy, the railway line, and the radio station) were hit, resulting in many casualties. During the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese occupation]], Soekaboemi became the meeting place of [[Mohammad Hatta]] and [[Sutan Sjahrir]] with representatives of the Japanese Empire to discuss the future of the Dutch East Indies, but both were given 'city prisoner' status. Soekaboemi also became one of the detention sites of [[United States|American]] and [[Australia]]n prisoners of war.<ref>{{cite book|last=Spiller|first=Harry|date=2015|title=American POWs in World War II: Twelve Personal Accounts of Captivity by Germany and Japan|location=|publisher=McFarland & Company|page=182|isbn=9780786453733}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Jong|first=Louis de|author-link=Loe de Jong|date=2004|title=The Collapse of a Colonial Society: The Dutch in Indonesia During the Second World War|location=|publisher=Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies|page=91|isbn=9789067182034}}</ref>

Also during the occupation, the Japanese created a strategic garrison in [[Ujung Genteng]], part of the South [[Sukabumi Regency]]. Remains of the harbor and lookout towers at the end of this peninsula are still in place, along with the caves that the Japanese lived and died in towards the end of the war. [[Ujung Genteng]] is directly North of [[Christmas Island]] and Australia and would have made an excellent point of defense or attack, without official records to substantiate this, it is presumed that they had their sights on Christmas Island and a close link to Australia.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

===Present day===
In early 2005, [[Sukabumi Regency]] became the first place in Indonesia that [[Poliomyelitis|polio]] was reported in ten years, the beginning of a nationwide outbreak of the disease which had been believed to be eradicated in the country.<ref>Indonesia confirms the second case of polio, ''ABC Radio Australia'' 5 April 2005.</ref>

==Government and politics==
===Administrative districts===
The city of Sukabumi is divided into seven [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''kecamatan''), listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and the 2020 Census,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> together with the official estimates as of 2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Sukabumi Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.3272)</ref> The table also includes the number of [[administrative village]]s (all classed as urban ''kelurahan'') in each district, and its postal codes.
