The '''Waikato''' ({{IPAc-en|'|w|aɪ|k|ɑː|t|ɔː}}) is a [[Regions of New Zealand|region]] of the upper [[North Island]] of New Zealand. It covers the [[Waikato District]], [[Waipa District]], [[Matamata-Piako District]], [[South Waikato District]] and [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton City]], as well as [[Hauraki Plains|Hauraki]], [[Coromandel Peninsula]], the northern [[King Country]], much of the [[Taupō District]], and parts of the [[Rotorua Lakes District]].<ref name=teara_overview>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/waikato-region/1 |title=Waikato region – Overview |first=Nancy |last=Swarbrick |date=3 June 2010 |encyclopedia=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |access-date=10 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127043418/http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/waikato-region/1 |archive-date=27 November 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> It is governed by the Waikato Regional Council.

The Waikato stretches from Coromandel Peninsula in the north, to the north-eastern slopes of [[Mount Ruapehu]] in the south, and spans the North Island from the west coast, through the Waikato and Hauraki to Coromandel Peninsula on the east coast. Broadly, the extent of the region is the [[Waikato River]] catchment. Other major catchments are those of the [[Waihou River|Waihou]], [[Piako River|Piako]], [[Awakino River (Waikato)|Awakino]] and [[Mokau River|Mokau]] rivers. The region is bounded by [[Auckland Region|Auckland]] on the north, [[Bay of Plenty Region|Bay of Plenty]] on the east, [[Hawke's Bay Region|Hawke's Bay]] on the south-east, and [[Manawatū-Whanganui]] and [[Taranaki]] on the south. Waikato Region is the fourth largest region in the country in area and population:<ref>{{cite web |title=About the Waikato region |publisher=Waikato Regional Council |url=http://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/Environmental-information/About-the-Waikato-region/ |access-date=11 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420041806/http://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/Environmental-information/About-the-Waikato-region/ |archive-date=20 April 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> It has a land area of {{Convert|23901.09|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} and a population of {{NZ population data 2018|Waikato region|y|y|y|(|).}}<!-- sentence period inside template -->

The region encompasses all or part of eleven [[Territorial authorities of New Zealand|territorial authorities]], the most of any region of New Zealand. It is centred on the Waikato which consists of [[Waikato District]], [[Matamata-Piako District]], [[Waipa District]], [[South Waikato District]] and [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton City]].<ref name=teara_overview/> In descending order of land area the eleven [[Territorial authorities of New Zealand#List of territorial authorities|territorial authorities]] are Taupō District (part), Waikato District, [[Waitomo District]] (part), [[Thames-Coromandel District]], [[Ōtorohanga District]], South Waikato District, Matamata-Piako District, Waipa District, [[Hauraki District]], Rotorua Lakes District (part), and Hamilton City.

== Name and etymology ==
The name for the region is taken from the [[Waikato River]]; ''waikato'' is a [[Māori language|Māori]] word traditionally translated as "flowing water" (specifically, ''wai'' = "water" and ''kato'' = "the pull of the river current in the sea").<ref name=teara_landmarks>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/waikato-tribes/2 |title=Waikato tribes – Waikato landmarks |first=Te Ahukaramū Charles |last=Royal |date=3 May 2010 |encyclopedia=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |access-date=10 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020234632/http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/waikato-tribes/2 |archive-date=20 October 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

When Waikato is used in spoken language some people use it in the [[definite article]], "the Waikato", whereas some people do not use "the". It is unknown why a difference is made.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Michael |first=Daly |date=16 October 2017 |title=Why Kiwis sometimes use 'the' in front of some place names |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/97800760/why-kiwis-sometimes-use-the-in-front-of-some-place-names#:~:text=Turning%20to%20large%20regional%20areas,for%20example%20Wairarapa%20and%20Waikato. |access-date=3 February 2024 |website=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]]}}</ref> "The" usually refers to a smaller region than the Waikato local government region. Two definitions that would meet with wide acceptance are those of the Waikato rugby football union and of Hamilton Waikato tourism.{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}}

==Geography==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}
[[File:Waikato river 750px.jpg|thumb|left|Waikato River passing through Hamilton]]

To the west, the region is bounded by the [[Tasman Sea]]. The coastal region is largely rough hill country, known locally as the [[Hakarimata Range]], though it is more gently undulating in the north, closer to the mouth of the Waikato River. The coast is punctured by three large natural harbours: [[Raglan Harbour]], [[Aotea Harbour]], and [[Kawhia Harbour]]. The area around Raglan is noted for its [[volcano|volcanic]] black sand beaches and for its fine [[surfing]] conditions at Manu Bay and [[Ruapuke]] beach.

To the east of the coastal hills lies the broad [[alluvial plain]] of the Waikato River. This region has a wet temperate climate, and the land is largely pastoral farmland created by European settlers draining the extensive natural swamps, although it also contains undrained [[peat]] [[swamp]] such as the {{Convert|200|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} peat dome south of Ngatea. It is in the broad undulating [[Waikato Plains]] that most of the region's population resides, and the land is intensively farmed with both livestock, mainly dairy cattle but with sheep farming on the hillier west margins, and crops such as maize. The area around [[Cambridge, New Zealand|Cambridge]] has many [[Thoroughbred horse race|thoroughbred]] stables.

The north of the region around [[Te Kauwhata]] produces some of New Zealand's best wines. Dozens of small shallow lakes lie in this area, the largest of which is [[Lake Waikare]].

To the east, the land rises towards the forested slopes of the [[Kaimai Range|Kaimai]] and [[Mamaku Ranges]]. The upper reaches of the Waikato River are used for [[hydroelectricity]], helped by several large artificial lakes in the region's south-east. The lowest and earliest-created such lake is [[Lake Karapiro]], now developed as a world-class rowing centre, where the world championships were held in 2010. The river flows out of the country's largest lake, [[Lake Taupō]], which is served by several important fishing rivers such as the [[Tongariro River|Tongariro]], on the [[North Island Volcanic Plateau|Central Plateau]], draining the eastern side of [[Mount Ruapehu]] and its neighbours.

The climate is mild and temperate with moderate rainfall of {{cvt|1200|to|1600|mm|in}} per annum, with the higher western hills having the most rain. Summers are drier with typical maximum temperatures of 22–28 degrees Celsius and overnight lows of 12–16 degrees. Summer droughts occur one year in ten. Typical winter maxima are 10–16 degrees Celsius, with lows generally ranging from 0–8 degrees. Depressions experience regular morning fog, under anticyclonic conditions, which burns off by late morning to produce many still, clear sunny days. Morning frosts are also common during winter anticyclones. Another distinctive feature is the low average wind speed in the interior basin due to the sheltering influence of the hills and mountains to the west and south-west. The prevailing winter wind is from the south-west. The Waikato has very high sunshine hours by world standards, averaging 2200 hours per year or about 40% higher than in the UK. This results in rapid growth of grass, crops and ornamental plants.

Hamilton Waikato takes in the local government areas of Hamilton City, the southern part of Waikato district, Waipa district, most of Matamata-Piako district and the South Waikato district.<ref>{{cite web |title=Waikato Rugby Union : Official Website |url=https://www.mooloo.co.nz |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310081035/http://www.mooloo.co.nz/ |archive-date=10 March 2018 |access-date=16 March 2018 |website=www.mooloo.co.nz}}</ref> Hamilton Waikato tourism takes in additionally the northern part of Waikato district (Tuakau and other centres), the northern King Country (Waitomo and Ōtorohanga districts), and the Te Aroha district.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hamilton & Waikato Visitor Information |url=http://www.hamiltonwaikato.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305020612/http://www.hamiltonwaikato.com/ |archive-date=5 March 2018 |access-date=16 March 2018 |website=hamiltonwaikato.com}}</ref>

==Economy==

The subnational gross domestic product (GDP) of the Waikato region was estimated at NZ$25.84 billion in the year to March 2019, 8.5% of New Zealand's national GDP. The subnational GDP per capita was estimated at $54,128 in the same period. In the year to March 2018, primary industries contributed $3.14 billion (13.0%) to the regional GDP, goods-producing industries contributed $5.70 billion (23.5%), service industries contributed $13.35 billion (55.0%), and taxes and duties contributed $2.08 billion (8.6%).<ref name=":6">{{Cite web |title=Regional gross domestic product: Year ended March 2019 {{!}} Stats NZ |url=https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/regional-gross-domestic-product-year-ended-march-2019 |website=www.stats.govt.nz |access-date=21 May 2020}}</ref>

Between 2000 and 2004, Waikato economic growth was lower than the national average. But from 2004 to 2007, real gross regional product for the Waikato Region increased by 5 per cent per year compared with 3.2 per cent for the national average. This faster growth can be attributed to rapidly growing dairy and business services industries, facilitated by proximity to the Auckland city, the main international gateway for New Zealand.<ref name="2009 Waikato Economic Report">{{cite web |title=2009 Waikato Economic Report |url=http://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/Publications/Technical-Reports/TR-200926/ |year=2009 |publisher=[[Waikato Regional Council]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719234312/http://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/Publications/Technical-Reports/TR-200926/ |archive-date=19 July 2011 |access-date=18 February 2010}}</ref>

=== Agriculture ===
Given the suitable geography and climate, the Waikato economy is strongly based on agriculture, especially dairy. Dairy farming has been the main agricultural activity since the late nineteenth century. Within the Waikato region, small co-operative dairy companies were widespread during the 20th century. Towards the end of the 20th century, frequent mergers of co-operative dairy companies occurred, which ultimately ended in the formation of New Zealand wide dairy co-operative [[Fonterra]] in 2001. In 2007, dairy farming and dairy processing combined contributed $2 billion (13%) to GRP, which had risen to $2.4bn by 2014, but only 13,683 (7.6%) of jobs in 2016.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web |url=https://www.dairynz.co.nz/media/4647827/quickstats-about-dairying-waikato.pdf |title=QuickStats about dairying – WAIKATO REGION |date=June 2016 |website=DairyNZ Economics Group |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424145208/https://www.dairynz.co.nz/media/4647827/quickstats-about-dairying-waikato.pdf |archive-date=24 April 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Dairy farms are mainly family owned (2,608 of 4,020 farms in 2016) with owners employing [[Sharemilking|sharemilkers]] in many cases (1,412 sharemilkers).<ref name=":5" /> The size of the average dairy herd in the Waikato has progressively increased. It was about 320 cows in 2012<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lic.co.nz/pdf/DAIRY%20STATISTICS%2010-11-WEB.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209132507/http://lic.co.nz/pdf/DAIRY%20STATISTICS%2010-11-WEB.pdf |archive-date=9 February 2013 }}</ref> and in 2016 was about 351 (total Waikato herd 1.41m cows),<ref name=":5" /> milked in either a herringbone or automated rotary cowshed so a large herd can be milked in under two hours. The cows are kept on grassland pasture all year due to the mild climate. In the Waikato the original English grasses used by earlier settlers – [[browntop]], [[fescue]] and [[Yorkshire Fog]] – have been replaced with higher producing Italian ryegrass and nitrogen-fixing white clover. Farmers use a variety of supplementary feeds in winter or during the infrequent summer droughts. Main feeds are hay, grass silage and chopped corn feed. The later is often fed out on a concrete pad to save transportation and wastage by trampling.

=== Manufacturing ===
The manufacturing sector in Waikato contributed $2,688 million in GDP in the year to March 2018, 11.1% of the regional GDP.<ref name=":6" /> According to the 2013 New Zealand census, the sector employed 18,519 people, or 9.9% of the region's employed population.<ref>{{Cite web |title=2013 Census QuickStats about work and unpaid activities |url=http://archive.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-work-unpaid.aspx |website=archive.stats.govt.nz |language=en-nz |access-date=23 May 2020}}</ref>

With a large dairy farming industry, the Waikato also has a large dairy processing industry. Fonterra operates dairy processing plants at [[Te Rapa]], Te Awamutu, [[Hautapu]], [[Waitoa]], [[Tīrau]] and [[Lichfield, New Zealand|Lichfield]]. Other dairy processing plants include [[Tatua Dairy Company]]'s plant at [[Tatuanui]], and Open Country Dairy's plant at [[Horotiu]] and [[Waharoa, New Zealand|Waharoa]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Fox |first=Andrea |date=14 May 2019 |title=Open Country Dairy has sights on more Waikato manufacturing growth |language=en-NZ |work=[[New Zealand Herald]] |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=12230893 |url-access=subscription |access-date=23 May 2020 |issn=1170-0777}}</ref>

The Waikato region has eight major [[Slaughterhouse|freezing works]]: [[AFFCO Holdings|AFFCO]] at Horotiu, Greenlea at Hamilton and Morrinsville, [[Silver Fern Farms]] at Te Aroha and Waitoa, Te Kuiti Meat Processors and Universal Beef Packers at Te Kuiti, and Crusader Meats at Benneydale.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Meat processing in New Zealand |url=https://beeflambnz.com/sites/default/files/Meat%20processors%20in%20NZ%20-%20May%202019.pdf |date=May 2019 |website=Beef + Lamb New Zealand}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Flanked by Te Iringa.jpg|thumb|Māori woman with a representation of the Waikato Ancestress "Te Iringa"]]
Before the arrival of Europeans, the Waikato contained the third most densely populated part of New Zealand, after Northland/Auckland and the Bay of Plenty. The Waikato ''rohe'' (area) was inhabited by ''[[iwi]]'' (tribes) such as those of the [[Tainui]] confederation, including [[Waikato (iwi)|Waikato]] and [[Ngāti Toa]]. Between about 1750 and 1842 the area was subject to a large number of invasions by other Māori iwi and hapu confederations and large scale population migrations took place by a number of ''[[hapū]]'' and ''iwi''. The largest battle ever fought in New Zealand took place near Ohaupo about 1790–1805, between two competing alliances of ''hapū''. During the latter stages of this volatile period, known as the [[Musket Wars]] (1807–1845), conflict led to a migration south to [[Taranaki]] and eventually Kapiti Island.

In 1840 44 Waikato chiefs travelled north to the Manukau Heads and Manukau Harbour to sign the Treaty of Waitangi, officially making the Waikato area part of New Zealand. Three Ngāti Maniapoto chiefs signed, as did three Ngāti Haua chiefs but most signatories were Waikato. Chief Te Whero whero did not sign, "probably due to the lack of dignity compared to the Waitangi event". Unusually, the copy signed was in English.<ref>NZ History. Waikato -Manukau Treaty copy. Updated 19 February 2016.</ref> Between 1840 and 1860 the CMS missionaries of the Anglican church assisted Waikato Māori in revolutionising their economy in the Kihikihi area by the introduction of such crops as peaches, maize and wheat.

Missionaries brought in millers and helped Māori establish eight flour mills. These flourished until 1857, as they provided flour for the growing Auckland market in the 1850s and for a brief while were exporting to Australia. There were mills at [[Aotea Harbour|Aotea]], [[Mount Taupiri|Kaitotehe]], Karakariki, [[Kihikihi]], [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Kirikiriroa]], Kohanga, Kopatauaki, [[Kāwhia Harbour|Mahoe]], Mangaharakeke, Mangapapa, Mangarewarewa, [[Mangatawhiri River|Mangatawhiri]], [[Waharoa, New Zealand|Matamata]] pā, [[Maungakawa]], [[Maungatautari]],<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document/?wid=3122# |title=Journal of the Polynesian Society: Maori Flour Mills Of The Auckland Province, 1846–1860, By R.

The route used to travel to and from Auckland was by dray to the [[Puniu River|Puniu]] stream, along the [[Waipā River]] to its junction with the Waikato. Near the Waikato Heads travellers entered the small [[Awaroa River (Waikato River tributary)|Awaroa River]]. During summer it was necessary to push or pull the waka through to the Manukau Harbour at Waiuku. By the 1850s a small bullock track had been established to Auckland via the settlements of Mauku, Drury, Papakura and Otahuhu, or [[Waka (canoe)|waka]] could take the sea route across the Manukau to Ihumatao (where Auckland International Airport is now).<ref>J. Gorst. The Māori King, P11 and Map. Reed. 2001.</ref> The main tribe to use this route and the main traders were the Maniapoto tribe. They occupied an area of fertile land south of Te Awamutu at Kihikihi and Rangiaowhia. Maniapoto sold wheat, peaches, potatoes and other food to Auckland and bought back shirts, sugar, tobacco and rum.<ref>J. Gorst. The Maori King. P13. Reed 2001</ref> The boom time ended in 1856–1857 with the end of the Australian gold rush, allowing importing of cheaper food, especially flour, from Australia. Even in the boom time of 1854–55, food grown by Waikato Māori, such as Ngāti Maniapoto, was taken to the Auckland market in very small amounts compared to food from the Waiheke Island -Thames area. In early 1855 Ngāti Maniapoto took only 3 canoes of potatoes to Auckland compared to 279 canoes containing a much wider variety of food from the Thames area.<ref>Maori Enterprise to c1860. Hazel Petrie.</ref> Missionaries had also established schools for Māori. Benjamin and Harriet Ashwell ran a school for 50 Māori girls aged 6–17 at Taupiri in 1853. The girls had been at the school for up to 3 years and could read and write in English and do mental arithmetic.<ref>The Voyagers.P Moon. p 62. Penguin 2014.</ref>

At the time of the [[Invasion of Waikato|Waikato campaign]] of 1863 against the rebel [[Māori King Movement]] forces, the population was estimated by the government at about 3,500 Māori.

During the late 1850s Maniapoto in particular become disgruntled in their dealings with Pakeha. They complained about the way they were treated in Auckland by traders but their chief complaint was that the government was underpaying them for land they were selling. The average price paid by government was 6d per acre but it was sold to settlers for 10/- per acre. The government argued that it had to pay for surveying and administration costs but to Māori it seemed unfair. Before the elevation of the first Māori king there was a wide range of opinions among influential Māori with some such as Wirimu Tamihana's father advocating supporting the Crown while Te Heuheu of Tuwharetoa advocated all out war against the government.<ref>J Gorst. The Maori King p 34, 35, 40. Reed 2001.</ref> This view was initially unpopular as the king movement hoped to work alongside the crown. Māori were upset at the number of children that had been fathered by Pakeha, who had then disappeared. The children were left to be raised by their mothers with general hapu support. John Gorst, a well-educated government agent, reported significant numbers of half-caste children in the Waikato in the late 1850s. However, in the Ngati Maniapoto iwi at least 7 Pakeha integrated successfully with the tribe from 1842, marrying Maori women. The best known are William Searancke, who became an important government agent, and Frenchman Louis Hetet, who became a successful trader. Their half-caste children lived with the iwi, and some became leading figures.

What tipped the balance was conflict and criminal activity within the Waikato region. Influential chiefs said the treaty had promised the government would help maintain peace. They asked for government magistrates and courts. The government attempted to fulfil these requests but many of the young men who put themselves forward for the positions simply saw that they had an opportunity to get wealthy at the government's expense. This upset the older chiefs, who wanted the strong Māori leader Te Wherowhero to return from Mangere to his lands at Tamahere (South Hamilton) to rein in the out-of-control young chief magistrates.<ref>J Gorst. The Maori King. P 39-49. Reed 2001.</ref>

The Waikato has a prominent history, particularly regarding relationships between Māori and European in early colonial New Zealand. The Waikato was within the defined boundaries of the colonial provinces of [[New Ulster Province|New Ulster]] (1841–1853) and [[Auckland Province|Auckland]] (1853–1876) but was principally Māori. During the [[New Zealand wars|land wars]] of the 1860s, the Waikato was the scene of five battles in what is referred to as the [[Invasion of the Waikato]]. In retaliation for the help Waikato Māori (mainly [[Ngāti Maniapoto]]) gave Taranaki Māori in their conflict over land in the earlier [[First Taranaki War]], and the decision by some Waikato ''hapu'' to form a separate kingdom – the King Movement or ''Kingitanga'' – in opposition to the government, the colonial government, with the help of troops brought from Britain and Queenite Māori loyal to the Crown, pushed south from the main settlement of [[Auckland]], fighting against Waikato raiders in Auckland before venturing into the Waikato to attack the combined ''hapu'' of the King Movement. During 1863 and 1864 fighting occurred at Pukekohe East, Titi hill, Burtts Farm, Galloway Redoubt, Kiri Kiri, Martyn's Farm, Patumahoe, Rhodes Clearing, Williamson's Clearing, Otau, Camerontown, Kakaramea and Wairoa ranges (all Auckland), [[Meremere]], Rangiriri, Ngāruawāhia, Rangiaowhia (southwest of Cambridge), Hairini Ridge and Ōrākau (near Kihikihi), all resulting in defeat for the ''Kingitanga'' forces. Eventually the rebel King Movement forces pulled back to positions in the area to the south of the Punui River in South Waikato, still known as the [[King Country]], after 19 defeats by the British. ''[[Rewi's Last Stand]]'', one of New Zealand's first motion pictures, in 1925, portrayed an entertaining, fictionalized version of the Ōrākau siege.

The headquarters of the Māori King Movement are now at [[Turangawaewae]] Marae at [[Ngāruawāhia]].

After the end of the war and the withdrawal of British and Australian troops, the region experienced a long period of economic recession after 1866. Most Māori had moved to the King Country and European settlers were more attracted to the South Island with its large gold discovery in Otago and the more easily farmed Canterbury Plains. The Waikato had poor land access and was not suitable for sheep farming which dominated livestock production in New Zealand until the 1890s invention of refrigeration. Dairying and the completion of the main trunk railway line at the turn of the century lead to a small, steady increase in population. After 1900, dairy production in the Waikato continued to grow, exporting butter and cheese mainly to Britain.

==People==
The people of the Waikato use the nickname [[Mooloo]] to apply to themselves or to their region, particularly in relation to sporting endeavours. The word was likely first applied to the [[Waikato Rugby Union|Waikato provincial rugby team]]. Its origin is related to the mascot of a pantomime-like milking cow used in parades, public events and sports matches — particularly rugby, reflecting the importance of the [[Dairy farming in New Zealand|dairy industry]] to the region. Waikato hosts the [[Chiefs (Super rugby franchise)|Chiefs]] Super Rugby team and [[Waikato Rugby Union|Waikato]] [[Mitre 10 Cup]] rugby team at [[Waikato Stadium]] and the [[Northern Districts Knights]] in domestic cricket at [[Seddon Park]], both in Hamilton.
