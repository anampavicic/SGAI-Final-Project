The region of modern-day São Paulo, then known as Piratininga plains around the [[Tietê River]], was inhabited by the [[Tupi people]], such as the [[Tupiniquim]], Guaianás, and [[Guaraní people|Guarani]]. Other tribes also lived in areas that today form the metropolitan region.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Goodman, Edward Julius |title=The Explorers of South America |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |year=1992 |location=Oklahoma}}</ref>

The region was divided in Caciquedoms (chiefdoms) at the time of encounter with the Europeans.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Steward, Julian Haynes |title=Handbook of South American Indians |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |year=1946 |isbn=9780806124209 |location=Washington D.C}}</ref> The most notable [[cacique]] was [[Tibiriçá]], known for his support for the Portuguese and other European colonists. Among the many indigenous names of places, rivers, neighborhoods, etc., that survive today are [[Tietê, São Paulo|Tietê]], [[Ipiranga (district of São Paulo)|Ipiranga]], [[Tamanduateí River|Tamanduateí]], [[Vale do Anhangabaú|Anhangabaú]], [[Piratininga]], [[Itaquaquecetuba]], [[Cotia]], [[Itapevi]], [[Barueri]], [[Embu-Guaçu]], etc.

===Colonial period===
[[File:Oscar_Pereira_da_Silva_-_Fundação_de_São_Paulo,_1909.jpg|thumb|left|''Founding of São Paulo'', 1909 painting by [[Oscar Pereira da Silva]]]]
[[File:Pátio do Colégio in São Paulo.jpg|thumb|left|Courtyard of the college, ''Pátio do Colégio'', in the [[Historic Center of São Paulo]]. At this location, the city was founded in 1554. The current building is a reconstruction made in the late 20th century, based on the [[Jesuit]] [[college]] and [[church (building)|church]] that were erected at the site in 1653.]]

The Portuguese village of [[São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga]] was marked by the founding of the [[Pátio do Colégio|Colégio de São Paulo de Piratininga]] on 25 January 1554. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] college of twelve priests included [[Manuel da Nóbrega]] and Spanish priest [[José de Anchieta]]. They built a mission on top of a steep hill between the [[Anhangabaú River|Anhangabaú]] and [[Tamanduateí River|Tamanduateí]] rivers.<ref name="Lawrence183">[[#Lawrence69|Rachel Lawrence]]: 2010, p. 183</ref>

They first had a small structure built of [[rammed earth]], made by Native Indian workers in their traditional style. The priests wanted to [[catechesis|evangelize]] these Indians who lived in the Plateau region of Piratininga and convert them to Christianity. The site was separated from the coast by the [[Serra do Mar]] mountain range, called "Serra Paranapiacaba" by the Indians.

The college was named for a Christian saint and its founding on the feast day of the celebration of the conversion of the Apostle [[Paul of Tarsus]]. Father José de Anchieta wrote this account in a letter to the Society of Jesus:

{{blockquote|The settlement of the region's Courtyard of the College began in 1560. During the visit of [[Mem de Sá]], [[List of governors-general of Brazil|Governor-General of Brazil]], the [[Captaincy of São Vicente]], he ordered the transfer of the population of the Village of [[São Bernardo do Campo]] to the vicinity of the college. It was then named "College of St. Paul of the Piratininga". The new location was on a steep hill adjacent to a large wetland, the [[Várzea do Carmo]]. It offered better protection from attacks by local Indian groups. It was renamed Vila de São Paulo, belonging to the Captaincy of São Vicente.}}

For the next two centuries, São Paulo developed as a poor and isolated village that survived largely through the cultivation of [[subsistence agriculture|subsistence crops]] by the labor of natives. For a long time, São Paulo was the only village in Brazil's interior, as travel was too difficult for many to reach the area. Mem de Sá forbade colonists to use the Caminho do Piraquê ''(Piraquê Path)'' and today known as [[Piaçaguera]], because of frequent Indian raids along it.

On 22 March 1681, Luís Álvares de Castro, the Second Marquis de Cascais and donee of the Captaincy of [[São Vicente, São Paulo|São Vicente]], moved the capital to the village of São Paulo ''(see [[Timeline of São Paulo]])'', designating it the "Head of the captaincy". The new capital was established on 23 April 1683, with public celebrations.

In the 17th century, São Paulo was one of the poorest regions of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colony]]. It was also the center of interior colonial development. Because they were extremely poor, the Paulistas could not afford to buy African slaves, as did other Portuguese colonists. The discovery of gold in the region of [[Minas Gerais]], in the 1690s, brought attention and new settlers to São Paulo. The Captaincy of São Paulo and Minas de Ouro (see [[Captaincies of Brazil]]) was created on 3 November 1709, when the Portuguese crown purchased the Captaincies of São Paulo and Santo Amaro from the former grantees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/captaincy-system|title=Captaincy System|website=Encyclopedia.com|access-date=5 February 2022|archive-date=11 April 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220411133951/https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/captaincy-system|url-status=live}}</ref>

Conveniently located in the country, up the steep ''[[Serra do Mar]]'' escarpment/mountain range when traveling from [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]], while also not too far from the coastline, São Paulo became a safe place to stay for tired travelers. The town became a center for the ''[[bandeirantes]]'', intrepid invaders who marched into unknown lands in search for gold, diamonds, precious stones, and Indians to enslave. The ''bandeirantes'', which could be translated as "flag-bearers" or "flag-followers", organized excursions into the land with the primary purpose of profit and the expansion of territory for the Portuguese crown. Trade grew from the local markets and from providing food and accommodation for explorers. The ''bandeirantes'' eventually became politically powerful as a group, and forced the expulsion of the [[Jesuit]]s from the city of São Paulo in 1640. The two groups had frequently come into conflict because of the Jesuits' opposition to the domestic [[History of slavery|slave trade]] in Indians.

On 11 July 1711, the town of São Paulo was elevated to city status. Around the 1720s, gold was found by the pioneers in the regions near what are now [[Cuiabá]] and [[Goiânia]]. The Portuguese expanded their Brazilian territory beyond the [[Tordesillas Line]] to incorporate the gold regions. When the gold ran out in the late 18th century, São Paulo shifted to growing [[sugar cane]]. Cultivation of this commodity crop spread through the interior of the Captaincy. The sugar was exported through the [[Port of Santos]]. At that time, the first modern highway between São Paulo and the coast was constructed and named the Calçada do Lorena ''("Lorena's [[Sett (paving)|sett]]way")''. Nowadays, the estate that is home to the Governor of the State of São Paulo, in the city of São Paulo, is called the ''[[Palácio dos Bandeirantes]]'' (Bandeirantes Palace), in the neighborhood of [[Morumbi, São Paulo|Morumbi]].

===Imperial period===
{{Main|Empire of Brazil}}
[[File:Vista_aérea_do_Monumento_à_Independência.jpg|thumb|[[Monument to the Independence of Brazil|Monument to Independence]] in Independence Park, located at the place where then-[[Pedro I of Brazil|Prince Pedro]] proclaimed the [[Independence of Brazil]]]]

After Brazil became [[Independence of Brazil|independent from Portugal]] in 1822, as declared by [[Pedro I of Brazil|Emperor Pedro I]] where the [[Monument to the Independence of Brazil]] is located, he named São Paulo as an Imperial City. In 1827, a law school was founded at the Convent of São Francisco, today part of the [[University of São Paulo]]. The influx of students and teachers gave a new impetus to the city's growth, thanks to which the city became the ''Imperial City and Borough of Students of St. Paul of Piratininga''.

The [[Coffee cycle|expansion of coffee production]] was a major factor in the growth of São Paulo, as it became the region's chief export crop and yielded good revenue. It was cultivated initially in the [[Paraíba Valley]] region in the East of the State of São Paulo, and later on in the regions of [[Campinas]], [[Rio Claro, São Paulo|Rio Claro]], [[São Carlos]] and [[Ribeirão Preto]].

From 1869 onward, São Paulo was connected to the port of Santos by the [[Estrada de Ferro Santos-Jundiaí]] (Santos-Jundiaí Railroad), nicknamed'' The Lady''. In the late 19th century, several other railroads connected the interior to the state capital. São Paulo became the point of convergence of all railroads from the interior of the state. Coffee was the economic engine for major economic and population growth in the State of São Paulo.

In 1888, the "Golden Law" (''[[Lei Áurea]]'') was sanctioned by [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil]], abolishing the institution of slavery in Brazil. Slaves were the main source of labor in the coffee plantations until then. As a consequence of this law, and following governmental stimulus towards the increase of immigration, the province began to receive a large number of immigrants, largely Italians, Japanese and Portuguese peasants, many of whom settled in the capital. The region's first industries also began to emerge, providing jobs to the newcomers, especially those who had to learn Portuguese.

===Old Republican period===

[[File:Avenida_Paulista_1902.jpg|thumb|[[Paulista Avenue]] in 1902]]

By the time Brazil became a republic on 15 November 1889, coffee exports were still an important part of São Paulo's economy. São Paulo grew strong in the national political scene, taking turns with the also rich state of Minas Gerais in electing [[List of presidents of Brazil|Brazilian presidents]], an alliance that became known as "[[Café com leite politics|coffee and milk]]", given that [[Minas Gerais]] was famous for its dairy production. During this period, São Paulo went from regional center to national metropolis, becoming industrialized and reaching its first million inhabitants in 1928. Its greatest growth in this period was relative in the 1890s when it doubled its population. The height of the coffee period is represented by the construction of the second [[Luz Station]] (the present building) at the end of the 19th century and by the [[Paulista Avenue]] in 1900, where they built many mansions.<ref name="Prefeitura">{{Cite web |date=5 October 2005 |title=Abrindo os trilhos para a locomotiva |url=http://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/portal/a_cidade/historia/index.php?p=4827 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323070214/http://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/portal/a_cidade/historia/index.php?p=4827 |archive-date=23 March 2012 |access-date=9 March 2017 |publisher=Prefeitura de São Paulo}}</ref>
[[File:Palacetes Prates e Vale do Anhangabaú.jpg|thumb|[[Viaduto do Chá]] and [[Vale do Anhangabaú|Anhangabaú Valley]] in the 1920s]]

Industrialization was the economic cycle that followed the coffee plantation model. By the hands of some industrious families, including many immigrants of Italian and Jewish origin, factories began to arise and São Paulo became known for its smoky, foggy air. The cultural scene followed [[modernism|modernist]] and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]] tendencies in fashion at the beginning of the 20th century. Some examples of notable modernist artists are poets [[Mário de Andrade]] and [[Oswald de Andrade]], artists [[Anita Malfatti]], [[Tarsila do Amaral]] and [[Lasar Segall]], and sculptor [[Victor Brecheret]]. The [[Modern Art Week]] of 1922 that took place at the [[Theatro Municipal (São Paulo)|Theatro Municipal]] was an event marked by [[avant-garde]] ideas and works of art. In 1929, São Paulo won its first skyscraper, the [[Martinelli Building]].<ref name="Prefeitura" />

The modifications made in the city by Antônio da Silva Prado, Baron of Duprat and [[Washington Luís]], who governed from 1899 to 1919, contributed to the climate development of the city; some scholars consider that the entire city was demolished and rebuilt at that time. São Paulo's main economic activities derive from the services industry – factories are since long gone, and in came financial services institutions, law firms, consulting firms. Old factory buildings and warehouses still dot the landscape in neighborhoods such as [[Barra Funda]] and [[Brás]]. Some cities around São Paulo, such as [[Diadema, São Paulo|Diadema]], [[São Bernardo do Campo]], [[Santo André]], and [[Cubatão]] are still heavily industrialized to the present day, with factories producing from cosmetics to chemicals to automobiles.

In 1924 the city was the stage of the [[São Paulo Revolt of 1924|São Paulo Revolt]], an armed conflict fought in working-class neighborhoods near the center of São Paulo that lasted 23 days, from 5 to 28 July, leaving hundreds dead and thousands injured. The confrontation between the federal troops of president [[Artur Bernardes]] against rebels of the [[Brazilian Army]] and the [[Public Forces (Brazil)|Public Force of São Paulo]] was classified by the federal government as a conspiracy, a mutiny and a "revolt against the Fatherland, without foundation, headed by disorderly members of the Brazilian Army".<ref name="Revolução de 1924">{{cite web|url=http://200.144.6.120/exposicao_revolucao/politica_nacional.php|title=Revolução de 1924|publisher=Arquivo Público do Estado de São Paulo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322093209/http://200.144.6.120/exposicao_revolucao/politica_nacional.php|archive-date=22 March 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=24 July 2023}}</ref> To face the rebels, the federal government launched an [[Bombing of São Paulo|indiscriminate artillery bombardment]] against the city, which affected mostly civilian targets; as a result of the bombing, a third of São Paulo's 700,000 inhabitants fled the city.

In 1932, São Paulo mobilized in its largest civic movement: the [[Constitutionalist Revolution]], when the entire population engaged in the war against the "Provisional Government" of [[Getúlio Vargas]]. In 1934, with the reunion of some faculties created in the 19th century, the [[University of São Paulo]] (USP) was founded, today the largest in Brazil.<ref name="HCSP">{{cite web|url=http://www.cidadedesaopaulo.com/sp/br/a-cidade-de-sao-paulo|title=História de São Paulo|author=Tourism Secretariat|date= 4 March 2010|access-date=3 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810073518/http://www.cidadedesaopaulo.com/sp/br/a-cidade-de-sao-paulo|archive-date=10 August 2011|url-status=dead|language=pt-br}}</ref><ref name="Times">{{cite web|last=Baty|first=Phil|title=The goals will come|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2010-2011/south-america.html|publisher=[[Times Higher Education]]|access-date=30 October 2010|archive-date=18 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918093701/http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2010-2011/south-america.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1947, São Paulo gained its first paved highway: the [[Via Anchieta]] (built on the old route of [[José de Anchieta]]), connecting the capital to the coast of São Paulo. In the 1950s, São Paulo was known as "the city that never stop" and as "the fastest growing city in the world".<ref name="SP450" /> São Paulo held a large celebration, in 1954, of the "Fourth Centenary" of the city's founding, when the [[Ibirapuera Park]] was inaugurated, many historical books are released and the source of the [[Tietê River]] in [[Salesópolis]] is discovered. With the transfer of part of the city's financial center, which was located in the historic center (in the region called the "Historic Triangle"), to [[Paulista Avenue]], its mansions were, for the most part, replaced by large buildings.<ref name="SP450" />

In the period from the 1930s to the 1960s, the great entrepreneurs of São Paulo's development were mayor [[Francisco Prestes Maia]] and the governor [[Ademar de Barros]], who was also mayor of São Paulo between 1957 and 1961. Prestes Maia designed and implemented, in the 1930s, the "Avenue Plan for the City of São Paulo", which revolutionized São Paulo's traffic.<ref>PRESTES MAIA, Francisco, ''Plano de Avenidas para a Cidade de São Paulo'', Editora Melhoramentos, São Paulo, 1930</ref> These two rulers are also responsible for the two biggest urban interventions, after the Avenues Plan, which changed São Paulo: the [[River engineering|rectification]] of the Tietê river with the construction of its banks and the [[São Paulo Metro]]: on February 13, 1963, governor Ademar de Barros and mayor Prestes Maia created study commissions (state and municipal) to prepare the basic project for the São Paulo Metro, and allocated their first funds to the Metro.<ref>''O Estado ajuda a Prefeitura a resolver o problema crucial da cidade: o metrô'', Diário Oficial do Estado de São Paulo, page 1, 14 February 1963</ref> At the beginning of the 1960s, São Paulo already had four million inhabitants.

In the municipality it is possible to observe forest birds that usually appear in the spring, due to the belt of native forest that still surrounds the metropolitan region. Species such as the [[rufous-bellied thrush]], [[golden-chevroned tanager]], [[great kiskadee]] and hummingbird are the most common. Despite the intense pollution, the main rivers of the city, the Tietê and the Pinheiros, shelter several species of animals such as [[capybara]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[southern lapwing]]s, [[heron]]s and [[nutria]]s. Other species found in the municipality are the [[gray brocket]], [[howler monkey]], [[green-billed toucan]] and the [[Amazonian umbrellabird]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlasambiental.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/pagina.php?id=27|title=Atlas Ambiental|publisher=Prefeitura de São Paulo|date=2002|access-date=11 October 2014|language=pt-BR|archive-date=26 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926000507/http://atlasambiental.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/pagina.php?id=27|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The problem of balanced water supply for the city - and for the metropolis, in general - is also a worrying issue: São Paulo has few sources of water in its own perimeter, having to seek it in distant hydrographic basins. The problem of water pollution is also aggravated by the irregular occupation of watershed areas, caused by urban expansion, driven by the difficulty of access to land and housing in central areas by the low-income population<ref>Whately, Marussia; Blauth, Fernanda; Weiss, Bruno; "Haverá água para todos?" in ''Le Monde Diplomatique Brasil'', edição de janeiro de 2008; São Paulo: Instituto Pólis</ref> and associated with real estate speculation and precariousness in new subdivisions. With this, there is also an overvaluation of individual transport over public transport – leading to the current rate of more than one vehicle for every two inhabitants and aggravating the problem of environmental pollution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/interna/0,,OI1928696-EI306,00.html|title=Carros de R$ 6 mil antecipariam apagão no trânsito|date=22 September 2007|publisher=Notícias Terra|access-date=10 September 2011|archive-date=13 October 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013171943/http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/interna/0,,OI1928696-EI306,00.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

São Paulo is considered the most [[multicultural]] city in Brazil. From 1870 to 2010, approximately 2.3 million [[immigrants]] arrived in the state, from all parts of the world. The [[Italian Brazilians|Italian community]] is one of the strongest, with a presence throughout the city.

Even today, Italians are grouped in neighborhoods like [[Bixiga]], [[Brás]], and [[Mooca (district of São Paulo)|Mooca]] to promote celebrations and festivals. In the early twentieth century, Italian and its dialects were spoken almost as much as [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] in the city, which influenced the formation of the São Paulo dialect of today.

Since the 19th century people began migrating from [[Northeast Region, Brazil|northeastern Brazil]] into São Paulo. This migration grew enormously in the 1930s and remained huge in the next decades. The concentration of land, modernization in rural areas, changes in work relationships and cycles of droughts stimulated migration. The largest concentration of northeastern migrants was found in the area of Sé/Brás (districts of [[Brás]], [[Bom Retiro, São Paulo|Bom Retiro]], [[Cambuci (district of São Paulo)|Cambuci]], [[Pari (district of São Paulo)|Pari]] and [[Sé (district of São Paulo)|Sé]]).

Like the cultural variety verifiable in São Paulo, there are several religious manifestations present in the city. Although it has developed on an eminently [[Catholic]] social matrix, both due to colonization and immigration – and even today most of the people of São Paulo declare themselves Roman Catholic – it is possible to find in the city dozens of different Protestant denominations, as well as the practice of [[Islam]], [[Kardecist spiritism|Spiritism]], among others. [[Buddhism]] and Eastern religions also have relevance among the beliefs most practiced by Paulistanos. It is estimated that there are more than one hundred thousand [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] followers each. Also considerable are [[Judaism]], [[Mormonism]] and [[Afro-Brazilian religions]].<ref name="Religion"/>

According to data from the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] (IBGE), in 2010 the population of São Paulo was 6,549,775 [[Roman Catholics]] (58.2%), 2,887,810 [[Protestants]] (22.1%), 531,822 [[Spiritists]] (4.7%), 101,493 [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (0.9%), 75,075 [[Buddhists]] (0.7%), 50,794 [[Umbanda|Umbandists]] (0.5%), 43,610 [[Jews]] (0.4%), 28,673 [[Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church|Catholic Apostolic Brazilians]] (0.3%), 25,583 eastern religious (0.2%), 18,058 [[Candomblé|Candomblecists]] (0.2%), 17,321 [[Mormons]] (0.2%), 14,894 Eastern Orthodox (0.1%), 9,119 [[Spiritualism (movement)|spiritualists]] (0.1%), 8,277 [[Muslims]] (0.1%), 7,139 [[esoteric]] (0.1%), 1,829 practiced Indian traditions (<0.1%) and 1,008 were [[Hindu]] (<0.1%).

The Catholic Church divides the territory of the municipality of São Paulo into four ecclesiastical circumscriptions: the [[Archdiocese of São Paulo]], and the adjacent Diocese of Santo Amaro, the Diocese of São Miguel Paulista and the Diocese of Campo Limpo, the last three suffragans of the first. The archive of the archdiocese, called the Metropolitan Archival Dom Duarte Leopoldo e Silva, in the [[Ipiranga (district of São Paulo)|Ipiranga]] neighborhood, holds one of the most important documentary heritage in Brazil.

Since the beginning of the 20th century, São Paulo has been a major economic center in Latin America. During two [[World war|World Wars]] and the [[Great Depression]], coffee exports (from other regions of the state) were critically affected. This led wealthy coffee farmers to invest in industrial activities that turned São Paulo into Brazil's largest industrial hub.

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Brazil}}

The primary language is [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. The general language from São Paulo General, or [[Tupi language|Tupi Austral]] (Southern Tupi), was the Tupi-based trade language of what is now São Vicente, São Paulo, and the upper Tietê River. In the 17th century it was widely spoken in São Paulo and spread to neighboring regions while in Brazil. From 1750 on, following orders from [[Marquess of Pombal]], Portuguese language was introduced through immigration and consequently taught to children in schools. The original [[Tupi Austral]] language subsequently lost ground to [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and eventually became extinct. Due to the large influx of [[Japanese Brazilians|Japanese]], [[German Brazilians|German]], [[Brazilians of Spanish descent|Spanish]], [[Italian Brazilian|Italian]] and [[Arab Brazilian|Arab]] immigrants etc., the Portuguese idiom spoken in the metropolitan area of São Paulo reflects influences from those languages.
[[File:Interior do Museu da Língua Portuguesa em São Paulo, Brasil.jpg|thumb|[[Museum of the Portuguese Language]]]]

The Italian influence in São Paulo accents is evident in the Italian neighborhoods such as Bela Vista, [[Mooca (district of São Paulo)|Mooca]], [[Brás]] and Lapa. Italian mingled with Portuguese and as an old influence, was assimilated or disappeared into spoken language. The local accent with Italian influences became notorious through the songs of [[Adoniran Barbosa]], a Brazilian [[samba]] singer born to Italian parents who used to sing using the local accent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://revistalingua.uol.com.br/textos.asp?codigo%3D12097 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706154937/http://revistalingua.uol.com.br/textos.asp?codigo=12097 |archive-date=6 July 2011 |title=A linguagem ítalo-brasileira {{!}} Revista Língua Portuguesa |access-date=8 April 2021}}</ref>

As the capital of the [[São Paulo (state)|state of São Paulo]], the city is home to the [[Palácio dos Bandeirantes|Bandeirantes Palace]] (state government) and the [[Legislative Assembly of São Paulo|Legislative Assembly]]. The Executive Branch of the municipality of São Paulo is represented by the [[mayor]] and his cabinet of secretaries, following the model proposed by the [[Constitution of Brazil|Federal Constitution]].<ref>{{cite web |title=São Paulo, da taipa ao concreto |url=http://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/portal/a_cidade/historia/index.php?p=2979 |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522102955/http://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/portal/a_cidade/historia/index.php?p=2979 |archive-date=22 May 2016 |access-date=29 March 2012 |publisher=Prefeitura de São Paulo}}</ref> The organic law of the municipality and the Master Plan of the city, however, determine that the public administration must guarantee to the population effective tools of manifestation of participatory democracy, which causes that the city is divided in regional prefectures, each one led by a Regional Mayor appointed by the Mayor.<ref name="districts" />

The legislative power is represented by the Municipal Chamber, composed of 55 aldermen elected to four-year posts (in compliance with the provisions of Article 29 of the Constitution, which dictates a minimum number of 42 and a maximum of 55 for municipalities with more than five million inhabitants). It is up to the house to draft and vote fundamental laws for the administration and the Executive, especially the municipal budget (known as the Law of Budgetary Guidelines).<ref>{{Cite web |title=LDO – Lei de Diretrizes Orçamentárias |url=http://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/cidade/secretarias/relacoes_internacionais/sao_paulo_cidade_global/index.php?p=1193 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119045205/http://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/cidade/secretarias/relacoes_internacionais/sao_paulo_cidade_global/index.php?p=1193 |archive-date=19 January 2012 |access-date=29 March 2012 |publisher=Prefeitura de São Paulo}}</ref> In addition to the legislative process and the work of the secretariats, there are also a number of municipal councils, each dealing with different topics, composed of representatives of the various sectors of organized civil society. The actual performance and representativeness of such councils, however, are sometimes questioned.

The following municipal councils are active: Municipal Council for Children and Adolescents (CMDCA); of Informatics (WCC); of the Physically Disabled (CMDP); of Education (CME); of Housing (CMH); of Environment (CADES); of Health (CMS); of Tourism (COMTUR); of Human Rights (CMDH); of Culture (CMC); and of Social Assistance (COMAS) and Drugs and Alcohol (COMUDA). The Prefecture also owns (or is the majority partner in their social capital) a series of companies responsible for various aspects of public services and the economy of São Paulo:
* [[Anhembi Convention Center|''São Paulo Turismo S/A'']] (SPTuris): company responsible for organizing large events and promoting the [[Tourism in the city of São Paulo|city's tourism]].

* [[SPTrans|''São Paulo Transportes Sociedade Anônima'']] (SPTrans): responsible for the operation of the public transport systems managed by the city hall, such as the municipal bus lines.

===Subdivisions===
São Paulo is divided into 32 [[subprefecture]]s, each with an administration ("subprefeitura") divided into several districts ("distritos").<ref name="districts">{{Cite web |title=Website of São Paulo City Hall |url=http://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/cidade/secretarias/subprefeituras/subprefeituras/index.php?p=8978 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705112812/http://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/cidade/secretarias/subprefeituras/subprefeituras/index.php?p=8978 |archive-date=5 July 2016 |access-date=27 June 2016}}</ref> The city also has a radial division into nine zones for purpose of traffic control and bus lines, which do not fit into the administrative divisions. These zones are identified by colors in the street signs. The historical core of São Paulo, which includes the inner city and the area of [[Paulista Avenue]], is in the [[Subprefecture of Sé]]. Most other economic and tourist facilities of the city are inside an area officially called ''Centro Expandido'' (Portuguese for "Broad Center", or "Broad Downtown"), which includes Sé and several other subprefectures, and areas immediately around it.

[[Luxury brand]]s tend to concentrate their business in São Paulo. Because of the lack of department stores and multi-brand boutiques, [[shopping mall]]s as well as the [[Jardins]] district attract most of the world's luxurious brands.

Since the beginning of the 20th century, São Paulo has been one of the main economic centers of [[Latin America]]. With the [[WWI|First]] and [[WWII|Second World Wars]] and the [[Great Depression]], coffee exports to the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] were heavily affected, forcing the rich coffee growers to invest in the industrial activities that would make São Paulo the largest industrial center in Brazil.

São Paulo is practically all served by the water supply network. The city consumes an average of 221 liters of water/inhabitant/day while the UN recommends the consumption of 110 liters/day. The water loss is 30.8%. However, between 11 and 12.8% of households do not have a sewage system, depositing waste in pits and ditches. Sixty percent of the sewage collected is treated. According to data from IBGE and Eletropaulo, the electricity grid serves almost 100% of households. The fixed telephony network is still precarious, with coverage of 67.2%. Household garbage collection covers all regions of the municipality but is still insufficient, reaching around 94% of the demand in districts such as [[Parelheiros (district of São Paulo)|Parelheiros]] and Perus. About 80% of the garbage produced daily by Paulistas is exported to other cities, such as [[Caieiras]] and [[Guarulhos]].<ref name="lixo">{{Cite web |date=14 May 2010 |title=A sustentabilidade urbana |url=http://www.estadao.com.br/estadaodehoje/20100514/not_imp551610,0.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20110706100614/http://www.estadao.com.br/estadaodehoje/20100514/not_imp551610,0.php |archive-date=6 July 2011 |access-date=9 May 2017 |publisher=O Estado de S.

===Urban planning===
[[Image:Margtiete.jpg|thumb|[[Marginal Tietê]], the main [[Controlled-access highway|expressway]] of the city]]
São Paulo has a myriad of urban fabrics. The original nuclei of the city are vertical, characterized by the presence of commercial buildings and services; And the peripheries are generally developed with two to four-story buildings – although such generalization certainly meets with exceptions in the fabric of the metropolis. Compared to other global cities (such as the island cities of [[New York City]] and [[Hong Kong]]), however, São Paulo is considered a "low-rise building" city. Its tallest buildings rarely reach forty stories, and the average residential building is twenty. Nevertheless, it is the fourth city in the world in quantity of buildings, according to the page specialized in research of data on buildings ''Emporis Buildings'',<ref>{{Cite web |title=Skyline Ranking |url=http://www.emporis.com/en/bu/sk/st/sr/ |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604005151/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2007/06/12/afx3810988.html |archive-date=4 June 2011 |access-date=9 May 2017 |publisher=Emporis.com}}</ref> besides possessing what was considered until 2014 the tallest skyscraper of the country, the [[Mirante do Vale]], also known as ''Palácio Zarzur Kogan'', with 170 meters of height and 51 floors.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nogueira |first=Sylvio Rocha |title=A verticalização predial e o melhor urbanismo brasileiro |url=http://www.revistasim.com.br/asp/materia.asp?idtexto=1136 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707053521/http://www.revistasim.com.br/asp/materia.asp?idtexto=1136 |archive-date=7 July 2009 |access-date=9 May 2017 |publisher=Revista SIM }}</ref>

Such tissue heterogeneity, however, is not as predictable as the generic model can make us imagine. Some central regions of the city began to concentrate indigents, [[drug trafficking]], street vending and [[prostitution]], which encouraged the creation of new socio-economic centralities. The characterization of each region of the city also underwent several changes throughout the 20th century. With the relocation of industries to other cities or states, several areas that once housed factory sheds have become commercial or even residential areas.<ref name="Planejamento">{{Cite web |last=Indriunas |first=Luís |editor-last=[[HowStuffWorks]] |title=Planejamento urbano em São Paulo |url=http://pessoas.hsw.uol.com.br/sao-paulo-urbanismo.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221153559/http://pessoas.hsw.uol.com.br/sao-paulo-urbanismo.htm |archive-date=21 December 2016 |access-date=9 May 2017 }}</ref>

São Paulo has a history of actions, projects and plans related to urban planning that can be traced to the governments of Antonio da Silva Prado, Baron Duprat, Washington and Luis Francisco Prestes Maia. However, in general, the city was formed during the 20th century, growing from village to metropolis through a series of informal processes and irregular urban sprawl.<ref>{{Cite web |title=São Paulo is the largest city in Brazil |url=http://friendsite.com/hardwarezone/blog/16972/S%C3%A3o+Paulo+is+the+largest+city+in+Brazil.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106065345/http://friendsite.com/hardwarezone/blog/16972/S%C3%A3o+Paulo+is+the+largest+city+in+Brazil.html |archive-date=6 January 2016 |access-date=23 May 2015}}</ref>

Urban growth in São Paulo has followed three patterns since the beginning of the 20th century, according to urban historians: since the late 19th century and until the 1940s, São Paulo was a condensed city in which different social groups lived in a small urban zone separated by type of housing; from the 1940s to the 1980s, São Paulo followed a model of center-periphery social segregation, in which the upper and middle-classes occupied central and modern areas while the poor moved towards precarious, self-built housing in the periphery; and from the 1980s onward, new transformations have brought the social classes closer together in spatial terms, but separated by walls and security technologies that seek to isolate the richer classes in the name of security.<ref name="Caldeira, Teresa P.R. 2000. p. 215">[Caldeira, Teresa P.R. "City of Walls: Crime, Segregation, and Citizenship in São Paulo," University of California Press, 2000. Berkeley. (p. 215)]</ref> Thus, São Paulo differs considerably from other Brazilian cities such as [[Belo Horizonte]] and [[Goiânia]], whose initial expansion followed determinations by a plan, or a city like [[Brasília]], whose master plan had been fully developed prior to construction.<ref>{{Cite web |title=São Paulo |url=http://pt.scribd.com/doc/134833915/Sao-Paulo |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106065345/http://pt.scribd.com/doc/134833915/Sao-Paulo |archive-date=6 January 2016 |access-date=23 May 2015}}</ref>

The effectiveness of these plans has been seen by some planners and historians as questionable. Some of these scholars argue that such plans were produced exclusively for the benefit of the wealthier strata of the population while the working classes would be relegated to the traditional informal processes. In São Paulo until the mid-1950s, the plans were based on the idea of "demolish and rebuild", including former Mayor [[Francisco Prestes Maia|Francisco Prestes Maia's]] road plan for São Paulo (known as the Avenues Plan) or [[Saturnino de Brito|Saturnino de Brito's]] plan for the Tietê River. The Plan of the Avenues was implemented during the 1920s and sought to build large avenues connecting the city center with the outskirts.

The plan also led to the expansion of bus services, which would soon replace the trolley as the preliminary transportation system.<ref>[Moreira dos Santos, Laerte.

São Paulo has two main airports, [[São Paulo/Guarulhos International Airport]] for international flights and national hub, and [[São Paulo–Congonhas Airport]] for domestic and regional flights. Another airport, the [[Campo de Marte Airport]], serves private jets and light aircraft. The three airports together moved more than 58.000.000 passengers in 2015, making São Paulo one of the top 15 busiest in the world, by number of air passenger movements. The region of Greater São Paulo is also served by [[Viracopos International Airport]], [[São José dos Campos Airport]] and [[Jundiaí Airport]].

Congonhas Airport operates flights mainly to Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte and Brasília. Built in the 1930s, it was designed to handle the increasing demand for flights, in the fastest growing city in the world. Located in Campo Belo District, Congonhas Airport is close to the three main city's financial districts: [[Paulista Avenue]], [[Brigadeiro Faria Lima Avenue]] and [[Engenheiro Luís Carlos Berrini Avenue]].

The São Paulo–Guarulhos International, also known as "Cumbica", is {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-east of the city center, in the neighboring city of [[Guarulhos]]. Every day nearly 110.000 people pass through the airport, which connects Brazil to 36 countries around the world. 370 companies operate there, generating more than 53.000 jobs. The international airport is connected to the metropolitan rail system, with [[Line 13 (CPTM)]].

Campo de Marte is in [[Santana (district of São Paulo)|Santana]] district, the northern [[zoning|zone]] of São Paulo. The airport handles private flights and air shuttles, including [[air taxi]] firms. Opened in 1935, Campo de Marte is the base for the largest helicopter fleet in Brazil and the world's, ahead of New York and Tokyo.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/20/brazil High above São Paulo's choked streets, the rich cruise a new highway] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116113516/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/20/brazil |date=16 November 2016 }} The Guardian, 20 June 2008</ref> This airport is the home base of the State Civil Police Air Tactical Unit, the State Military Police Radio Patrol Unit and the São Paulo Flying Club.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Campo de Marte Airport |url=http://www.infraero.gov.br/usa/aero_prev_home.php?ai=218 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014021207/http://www.infraero.gov.br/usa/aero_prev_home.php?ai=218 |archive-date=14 October 2007 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Infraero.gov.br}}</ref>

The [[Rodoanel Mário Covas]] (official designation SP-021) is the [[beltway]] of the [[Greater São Paulo]]. Upon its completion, it will have a length of {{convert|177|km|abbr=on}}, with a radius of approximately {{convert|23|km|abbr=on}} from the geographical center of the city. It was named after Mário Covas, who was mayor of the city of São Paulo (1983–1985) and a state governor (1994-1998/1998-2001) until his death from cancer. It is a controlled access highway with a speed limit of {{convert|100|km/h|0|abbr=on}} under normal weather and traffic circumstances.

The two major São Paulo [[railway stations]] are Luz and Júlio Prestes in the Luz/[[Campos Elíseos (São Paulo)|Campos Eliseos]] region. [[Estação Júlio Prestes|Julio Prestes Station]] connected Southwest São Paulo State and Northern [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] State to São Paulo City. Agricultural products were transferred to Luz Station from which they headed to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and overseas. Júlio Prestes stopped transporting passengers through the Sorocabana or FEPASA lines and now only has metro service. Due to its acoustics and interior beauty, surrounded by Greek revival columns, part of the rebuilt station was transformed into the São Paulo Hall.

[[Luz Station]] was built in Britain and assembled in Brazil. It has an underground station and is still active with metro lines that link São Paulo to the Greater São Paulo region to the East and the Campinas Metropolitan region in [[Jundiaí]] in the western part of the State. Luz Station is surrounded by important [[culture|cultural]] institutions such as the [[Pinacoteca do Estado]], The Museu de Arte Sacra on Tiradentes Avenue and Jardim da Luz, among others. It is the seat of the [[Estrada de Ferro Santos-Jundiaí|Santos-Jundiaí line]] which historically transported [[Immigration to Brazil|international immigrants]] from the [[Port of Santos]] to São Paulo and the coffee plantation lands in the Western region of [[Campinas]].

[[Adoniran Barbosa]] was a [[samba]] singer and composer who became successful during São Paulo's early radio era. Born in 1912 in the town of [[Valinhos]], Barbosa was known as the "composer to the masses", particularly Italian immigrants living in the quarters of Bela Vista, also known as "Bexiga" and Brás, as well as those who lived in the city's many 'cortiços' or tenements. His songs drew from the life of urban workers, the unemployed and those who lived on the edge. His first big hit was "Saudosa Maloca" ("Shanty of Fond Memories" – 1951), wherein three homeless friends recall with nostalgia their improvised shanty home, which was torn down by the landowner to make room for a building. His 1964 [[Trem das Onze]] ("The 11&nbsp;pm Train"), became one of the five best samba songs ever, the protagonist explains to his lover that he cannot stay any longer because he has to catch the last train to the [[Jaçanã (district of São Paulo)|Jaçanã suburb]], for his mother will not sleep before he arrives home. Another important musician with a similar style is [[Paulo Vanzolini]]. Vanzolini is a PhD in biology and a part-time professional musician. He composed a song depicting a love murder scene in São Paulo called "Ronda".

In the late 1960s, a psychedelic rock band called [[Os Mutantes]] became popular. Their success is related to that of other [[tropicalismo|tropicalia]] musicians. The group was known as very ''paulistanos'' in its behavior and clothing. Os Mutantes released five albums before lead singer [[Rita Lee]] departed in 1972 to join another group called [[Tutti Frutti (Brazilian band)|Tutti Frutti]]. Although initially known only in Brazil, Os Mutantes became successful abroad after the 1990s. In 2000, ''[[Tecnicolor]]'', an album recorded in the early 1970s in English by the band, was released with artwork designed by [[Sean Lennon]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Music – Culture – About SP – Governo do Estado de São Paulo |url=http://www.saopaulo.sp.gov.br/en/conhecasp/cultura_musica.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424105426/http://www.saopaulo.sp.gov.br/en/conhecasp/cultura_musica.php |archive-date=24 April 2015 |access-date=23 May 2015 }}</ref>

In the early 1980s, a band called ''[[Ultraje a Rigor]]'' (Elegant Outrage) emerged. They played a simple and irreverent style of rock. The lyrics depicted the changes in society and culture that Brazilian society was experiencing. A late punk and garage scene became strong in the 1980s, perhaps associated with the gloomy scenario of unemployment during an extended recession. Bands originating from this movement include [[Ira!]], [[Titãs]], [[Ratos de Porão]] and [[Inocentes]]. In the 1990s, [[drum and bass]] arose as another musical movement in São Paulo, with artists such as [[DJ Marky]], [[DJ Patife]], [[Xerxes de Oliveira|XRS]], [[Drumagick]] and [[Fernanda Porto]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=18 March 2009 |title=Movement website |url=http://www.movement.co.uk/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504090151/http://movement.co.uk/ |archive-date=4 May 2010 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Movement.co.uk}}</ref> Many [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands also originated in São Paulo, such as [[Angra (band)|Angra]], [[Project46]], [[Torture Squad]], Korzus and [[Dr. Sin]]. Famous electro-pop band [[CSS (band)|Cansei de Ser Sexy]], or CSS (Portuguese for "tired of being sexy") also has its origins in the city.

Many of the most important classical Brazilian living composers, such as [[José Carlos Amaral Vieira|Amaral Vieira]], [[Osvaldo Lacerda]] and [[Edson Zampronha]], were born and live in São Paulo. Local [[baritone]] [[Paulo Szot]] has won international acclaim performing for six consecutive seasons at The Metropolitan Opera, La Scala and Opera de Paris, among others; and The [[Tony Award]] for best actor in a musical for his performance in a 2008 revival of ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]''. The [[Orquestra Sinfônica do Estado de São Paulo|São Paulo State Symphony]] is one of the world's outstanding orchestras; their artistic director beginning in 2012 is the noted American conductor [[Marin Alsop]]. In 1952, [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]] wrote his Symphony Number 10 ('Ameríndia') for the 400th anniversary of São Paulo: an allegorical, historical and religious account of the city told through the eyes of its founder [[José de Anchieta]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sao Paulo City – Brazil, Sao Paulo Travel : SphereInfo.com |url=http://www.sphereinfo.com/brazil/sao%20paulo.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130185222/http://www.sphereinfo.com/brazil/sao-paulo.htm |archive-date=30 November 2016 |access-date=23 May 2015}}</ref>

São Paulo was home to the first [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries in Brazil, in the early 16th century. They wrote reports to the Portuguese crown about the newly found land, the [[Indigenous peoples|native peoples]] and composed poetry and music for the [[catechism]], creating the first written works from the area. The literary priests included [[Manuel da Nóbrega]] and [[José de Anchieta]], living in or near the colony then called ''Piratininga''. They also helped to register the [[Old Tupi language]], lexicon and its grammar.
In 1922, the Brazilian Modernist Movement, launched in São Paulo, began to achieve cultural independence. Brazil had gone through the same stages of development as the rest of Latin America, but its political and cultural [[independence]] came more gradually.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mexico at the World's Fairs |url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft2k4004k4&chunk.id=d0e5397&toc.id=d0e5397&brand=ucpress |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317220302/http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft2k4004k4&chunk.id=d0e5397&toc.id=d0e5397&brand=ucpress |archive-date=17 March 2015 |access-date=23 May 2015}}</ref>

Brazilian elite culture was originally strongly tied to [[Culture of Portugal|Portugal]]. Gradually writers developed a multi-ethnic body of work that was distinctively Brazilian. The presence of large numbers of former slaves added a distinctive [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] character to the [[Culture of Brazil|culture]]. Subsequent infusions of immigrants of non-Portuguese origin broadened the range of influences.<ref name="Modernism" />

[[Mário de Andrade]] and [[Oswald de Andrade]] were the prototypical modernists. With the urban poems of "Paulicéia Desvairada" and "Carefree Paulistan land" (1922), Mário de Andrade established the [[Cultural movement|movement]] in Brazil. His rhapsodic novel ''Macunaíma'' (1928), with its abundance of Brazilian [[folklore]], represents the apex of [[modernism]]'s nationalist prose through its creation of an offbeat native [[hero|national hero]]. Oswald de Andrade's experimental poetry, [[avant-garde]] prose, particularly the novel Serafim Ponte Grande (1933) and provocative manifestos exemplify the movement's break with tradition.<ref name="Modernism" />

Modernist artists and writers chose the Municipal Theatre of São Paulo to launch their Modernist manifesto. The site happened to be a bastion of European culture with opera and classical music presentations from Germany, France, Austria and Italy. They defied the high society that frequented the venue and who insisted on speaking only foreign languages such as French, behaving as if Brazilian culture did not matter.<ref name="Modernism">{{Cite web |last=noicols |date=12 July 2013 |title=São Paulo Culture |url=http://sasopaulo.blogspot.com.br/2013/07/culture.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201212813/http://sasopaulo.blogspot.com.br/2013/07/culture.html |archive-date=1 February 2014 |access-date=22 July 2014 |publisher=Sasopaulo.blogspot.com.br}}</ref>

===Theaters===
[[File:Webysther_20190304120141_-_Theatro_municipal.jpg|thumb|[[Municipal Theatre of São Paulo]]]]

Many historians believe that the first theatrical performance in Brazil was held in São Paulo. The Portuguese [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary [[José de Anchieta]] (1534–1597) wrote short plays that were performed and watched by the Tupi–Guarani natives. In the second half of the 19th century a cultural, musical and theatrical life emerged. [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European ethnic groups]] began holding performances in some of the state's rural cities. The most important period for the art in São Paulo was the 1940s. São Paulo had had a professional company, Teatro Brasileiro de Comédia, (Brazilian Theater of Comedy), along with others.

During the 1960s, major theater productions in São Paulo and Brazil were presented by two groups. Teatro de Arena began with a group of students from Escola de Arte Dramática (Drama [[Art school|Art School]]), founded by Alfredo Mesquita, in 1948. In 1958, the group excelled with the play "Eles não usam black tie" by [[Gianfrancesco Guarnieri]] which was the first in the history of the Brazilian drama to feature [[Wage labour|labor]] [[Laborer|workers]] as [[protagonist]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Theaters – Culture – About SP – Governo do Estado de São Paulo |url=http://www.saopaulo.sp.gov.br/en/conhecasp/cultura_teatros.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424112445/http://www.saopaulo.sp.gov.br/en/conhecasp/cultura_teatros.php |archive-date=24 April 2015 |access-date=23 May 2015 }}</ref>

After the military coup of 1964, plays started focusing on [[History of Brazil|Brazilian history]] (Zumbi, Tiradentes). Teatro de Arena and Teatro Oficina supported the democratic resistance during the [[military dictatorship]] period, marked by its censorship. The Tropicalist movement began there. A number of plays represented [[history|historic]] moments, notably "O Rei da Vela", "Galileu Galilei" (1968), "Na Selva das Cidades" (1969) and "Gracias Señor" (1972).

The district of Bixiga concentrates the greatest number of [[theater]]s, around 40 including the theaters that are closed for refurbishing or for other reasons, and small alternatives companies venues. Some of the most important are Renault, Brigadeiro, Zaccaro, [[Bibi Ferreira]], Maria della Costa, Ruth Escobar, Opera, TBC, Imprensa, Oficina, Àgora, Cacilda Becker, Sérgio Cardoso, do Bixiga, and Bandeirantes.
