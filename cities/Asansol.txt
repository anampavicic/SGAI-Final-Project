==Etymology==
"[[Terminalia elliptica|Asan]]", a species of tree which generally grows thirty meters tall, is found on the banks of the Damodar River; "sol" refers to land. The name "Asansol" is a combination of these two words. Asansol is a city on the banks of Damodar and its land is rich in minerals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Indian%20Laurel.html|title=Indian Laurel|access-date=25 December 2019|archive-date=25 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191225061636/http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Indian%20Laurel.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Historically the city was anglicised as ''Assensole'' during the British era but the name was reverted after Independence.<ref>{{cite journal |title=General Report - Public Instruction In Bengal |date=1884–1885 |url=https://dspace.gipe.ac.in/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10973/47105/GIPE-070160.pdf |page=108 |access-date=12 March 2022 |archive-date=21 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220221025113/https://dspace.gipe.ac.in/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10973/47105/GIPE-070160.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

==History==
The region is believed to have been a part of the kingdom of Vishnupur where the [[Mallabhum|Malla dynasty]] ruled for approximately a thousand years till the emergence of the British. This theory is backed by the presence of Vishnupur style temple present at Chhotodighari village and Domohani village in Asansol.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.asansolmunicipalcorporation.org/amrut/amrut%20news.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=21 April 2017 |archive-date=5 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205021336/http://www.asansolmunicipalcorporation.org/amrut/amrut%20news.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Economy==
The economy of Asansol is primarily dependent on its steel and coal industries, railways, and its trade and commerce.

===Steel===
[[File:IISCO Panoramic View 1.jpg|thumb|right|IISCO panoramic view, Asansol]]
[[File:Modernisation of ISP.JPG|thumb|right|Modernised ISP]]
The [[Steel Authority of India]] [[IISCO]] (Indian Iron and Steel Company Ltd) steel-making plant at [[Kulti]] was the first such facility in India. It became well known during the 1960s and 1970s, with its company shares being traded on the [[London Stock Exchange]]. However, a decade later the company became loss-making until it was revived in 2006 when it merged with the [[Steel Authority of India]]. Modernisation at [[IISCO Steel Plant]] has helped the city develop at a very rapid pace. The plant's capacity will be raised from 0.4 MT to 2.5 MT of saleable steel, using what will be the biggest [[blast furnace]] in the country.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.sail.co.in/sail-press-release/pm-dedicates-nation-sail%E2%80%99s-modernised-expanded-iisco-steel-plant-burnpur |title = PM Dedicates to the Nation SAIL's Modernised & Expanded IISCO Steel Plant at Burnpur |work = Press Release |publisher = SAIL |access-date = 4 March 2017 |archive-date = 22 March 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160322122002/http://www.sail.co.in/sail-press-release/pm-dedicates-nation-sail%E2%80%99s-modernised-expanded-iisco-steel-plant-burnpur |url-status = dead }}</ref> As of 2015, the investment for modernisation was the single largest investment in West Bengal till then.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.sail.co.in/sail-press-release/chairman-sail-reviews-performance-isp-burnpur | title = Chairman, SAIL reviews performance of ISP, Burnpur | work = Press Release 7 March 2015 | publisher = SAIL | access-date = 30 March 2017 | archive-date = 13 October 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181013093334/https://www.sail.co.in/sail-press-release/chairman-sail-reviews-performance-isp-burnpur | url-status = dead }}</ref>

===Coal===
[[Eastern Coalfields]], which has its headquarters in Sanctoria P.O. - Dishergarh, has a significant presence in the area due to the huge deposits of high-quality coal. However, most of the coalfields and surrounding residential colonies are located away from the main city. Nearby areas like Raniganj, Chinakuri, and Jamuria are of particular importance as coal blocks. As of 2012, the total coal reserve in the ECL command area up to 600 metre depth was 49.17 billion tonnes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.easterncoal.gov.in/|title=Welcome to official website of Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL)|website=www.easterncoal.gov.in|access-date=19 April 2017|archive-date=21 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421062417/http://www.easterncoal.gov.in/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coalindia.in/en-us/company/history.aspx|title=History|access-date=25 December 2019|archive-date=4 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204000436/https://www.coalindia.in/en-us/company/history.aspx|url-status=dead}}</ref>

A highway bypass avoids the areas of Ushagram, Murgasol, Asansol Bazar, Chelidanga, BNR, Gopalpur, Neamatpur, Kulti, and Barakar. Some of the other important roads of the city are namely Vivekananda Avenue, Burnpur Road, and S.B Gorai Road.

===Railway===
[[File:Asansol rail station in Asansol 05.jpg|thumb|Asansol Junction railway station building]]

As far as Eastern Railway is concerned, Asansol Division is referred to as the heart of operations, being at the crossroads of the Grand Chord route via Gaya and the main line route via Patna. With a total of 629.38 route kilometres, the division has the unique distinction of having quadruple lines (two up and two down line) from Khana to Sitarampur.

The railway track from Kolkata to Delhi passes through the subdivision and bifurcates into the main line and the grand chord line at [[Sitarampur]] railway junction, a little to the west of Asansol railway junction. Another railway track links Asansol with Adra and then to [[Jamshedpur]] via Purulia and [[Kharagpur]] via Bankura. A branch line connects [[Andal railway station|Andal]] with [[Sainthia railway station|Sainthia]] on the [[Sahibganj Loop]].

Almost all the trains linking Kolkata with north India also connect with Asansol including Howrah-Patna Vande Bharat Express, Sealdah Rajdhani, Howrah Rajdhani, Howrah Duronto, Sealdah Humsafar Express, Yuva Express and Shalimar Duronto. As a result, Asansol enjoys good connectivity with cities like [[New Delhi]], [[Jammu]], [[Amritsar]], [[Ludhiana]], [[Allahabad]], [[Kanpur]], [[Lucknow]], [[Dehradun]], [[Jaipur]], [[Kota, Rajasthan|Kota]], [[Jodhpur]], [[Jaisalmer]], [[Gwalior]], [[Bhopal]], [[Indore]], [[Patna]], [[Ranchi]], [[Durgapur]] and [[Dhanbad]] on the one hand and commands a fairly good traffic movement towards the western cities like [[Mumbai]], [[Ahmedabad]] and [[Surat]] and southern cities like [[Bhubaneshwar]], [[Visakhapatnam]], [[Vijaywada]], [[Chennai]], [[Bangalore]] and [[Trivandrum]]. It is also connected with [[Guwahati]] in the north-east region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.makemytrip.com/railways/asansol_jn-asn-railway-station.html/|title=Asansol Jn Train Railway Station|website=Make My Trip|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523124823/http://www.makemytrip.com/railways/asansol_jn-asn-railway-station.html/|archive-date=23 May 2010}}</ref>

Recently [[Airport Authority of India]] gave nod to start commercial flights for six routes in West Bengal; [[Burnpur Airport]] being one of them is hopeful to receive its first commercial flight by the last quarter of 2019.<ref>[http://cadup.gov.in/writereaddata/pdf/RCS_Round_1_and_2.pdf RCS round 1 and 2]cadup.gov.in {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190227060607/http://cadup.gov.in/writereaddata/pdf/RCS_Round_1_and_2.pdf |date=27 February 2019 }}</ref>
