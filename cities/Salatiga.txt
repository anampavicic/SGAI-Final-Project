'''Salatiga''' ({{langx|jv|ꦯꦭꦠꦶꦒ}}) is a [[Cities of Indonesia|city]] in [[Central Java]] province, Indonesia. It covers an area of {{convert|54.98|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and had a population of 192,322 at the [[2020 Indonesian census|2020 Census]];<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 201,369, comprising 99,872 males and 101,497 females.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Salatiga Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.3373)</ref> Located between the cities of [[Semarang]] and [[Surakarta]], and administratively an independent city enclaved within [[Semarang Regency]], it sits at the foot of [[Mount Merbabu]] ({{convert|3,142|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and [[Mount Telomoyo]], and has a relatively cool climate due to its elevated position. Salatiga is a part of the [[Semarang metropolitan area]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Monolith of Plumpungan 2006.jpg|thumb|left|[[Prasasti Plumpungan|Plumpungan Inscription]]]]

Salatiga is thought to be named either after the goddess of Trisala, or after the three wrongs done to the first king of Semarang.

In the first explanation, the people of the village celebrate the goddess of Siddhadewi, who is mentioned in the [[Prasasti Plumpungan|Monolith of Plumpungan]]. Siddhadewi was also called ''Trisala'', so the village was called Trisala and in the years to come became ''Salatri'' and eventually Salatiga.{{sfn|Maharani|2009|p=37}}

The second explanation is based on the story of Ki Ageng Pandanaran, the first regent of [[Semarang]], who was robbed by three muggers, and he thus named the location ''Salah Telu''. ''Salah'' means ''wrong'' in both [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Javanese language|Javanese]]. ''Telu'' is Low Javanese for ''three'', spelled is ''tiga'' in both the more refined Middle/High Javanese (but pronounced /tigo/ in Javanese respectively /tiga/ in Indonesian). Hence the name ''Salatiga'' from Salah Tiga.{{sfn|Maharani|2009|p=38}}

==History==
The official birth date of Salatiga is 24 July 750 A.D. (the 31st date and 4th year of the [[Saka calendar]]).  The scroll ''[[Prasasti Plumpungan|Monolith of Plumpungan]]'' (''[[Prasasti Plumpungan]]'' in [[Sanskrit]]) by King Bhanu, declares ''May you be happy! All the people'' ("''Srir = astu swasti prajabhyah''") and designated ''village of Hampran (Desa Hampran)'' a ''Perdikan village (Desa Perdikan, meaning a tax-free village)''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mubarok|first1=Imam|title=Menengok Prasasti Plumpungan, cikal bakal Salatiga|url=https://www.merdeka.com/peristiwa/menengok-prasasti-plumpungan-cikal-bakal-salatiga.html|access-date=28 December 2016|work=Merdeka.com|date=30 August 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228195307/https://www.merdeka.com/peristiwa/menengok-prasasti-plumpungan-cikal-bakal-salatiga.html|archive-date=28 December 2016}}</ref> "Çrirastuswasti Prajabyah" is the official motto of Salatiga as written in the government seal.

In 1746, the [[Dutch East India Company]] (''Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie'', VOC) built De Hersteller fort in Salatiga because Salatiga was strategically located at the intersection between [[Semarang]], [[Surakarta]] and [[Magelang]].{{sfn|Maharani|2009|p=63}}
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De Toetangsche weg te Salatiga Midden-Java TMnr 10007722.jpg|thumb|260px|Salatiga street scenery in 1918]]

On 1 July 1917 the village of Salatiga was designated as a ''stads gemeente'' or small town by the [[Dutch East Indies]] government.{{sfn|Maharani|2009|p=42}} In the colonial era, Salatiga was [[Social stratification|stratified by race]]. The Europeans lived near the city centre, at the ''Toentangscheweg'' (Toentang Road) leading to Semarang and also near to Dutch plantations in the Salatiga Afdeling.{{sfn|Maharani|2009|pp=48–49}} The Chinese were based near the trading centre, the Kalicacing Market, at the ''Soloscheweg'' (Solo Road).{{sfn|Maharani|2009|p=52}} Native people were bound to live outside the European and Chinese communities.{{sfn|Maharani|2009|p=54}} The education system was divided accordingly, with different schools for the Europeans, the Chinese and the natives.{{sfn|Maharani|2009|p=49}} Salatiga was led by a ''burgermeester'' (mayor), assisted by ''College van Burgermeester en Wethouders''. There was a legislative body, the ''Stadsgemeenteraad''; however, its membership was not proportional, with 8 seats for the Europeans, 1 seat for the Chinese, and only 2 seats for the natives who form the majority of the people.{{sfn|Maharani|2009|p=56}} The economy of Salatiga was hampered by the [[Great Depression|world economic depression of the 1930s]]. To reduce the city's spending the salaries of government officials were cut by up to 15%.{{sfn|Maharani|2009|p=59}} Salatiga had an important economic role as a [[hinterland]] to Semarang, providing agricultural products like coffee, rubber, cacao, cotton, spices, tobacco, wheat and vegetables to Semarang to be processed.{{sfn|Maharani|2009|p=64}}

Supported by geographical factors, its mostly mild climate and its luxurious buildings with [[Landhuis#Indies Style|Indies architecture]],{{sfn|Maharani|2009|p=57}} Salatiga's beauty was well known during the Dutch colonisation, even it was called ''De Schoonste Stad van Midden-Java'' (The Most Beautiful City in Central Java).<ref>{{cite web|title=Sejarah Kota Salatiga|trans-title=History of the City of Salatiga|publisher=Government of the City of Salatiga|url=http://pemkot-salatiga.go.id/sejarah_salatiga.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819145358/http://www.pemkot-salatiga.go.id/sejarah_salatiga.html|archive-date=19 August 2006|language=id}}</ref>

==Administration==
Before 1992, Salatiga comprised a single administrative [[districts of Indonesia|district]] (''kecamatan''), the Salatiga District. According to Government Regulation No. 69 of 1992, 13 [[Villages of Indonesia|villages]] from [[Semarang Regency]] were moved into Salatiga, and Salatiga District was dissolved. There are now four districts: Argomulyo, Tingkir, Sidomukti, and Sidorejo.<ref>{{cite web |title=Peraturan Pemerintah (PP) No. 69 Tahun 1992 tentang Perubahan Batas Wilayah Kotamadya Daerah Tingkat II Salatiga Dan Kabupaten Daerah Tingkat II Semarang |url=https://peraturan.bpk.go.id/Home/Download/47390/PP%20NO%2069%20TH%201992.pdf |publisher=[[Badan Pemeriksa Keuangan Republik Indonesia]] |access-date=20 January 2022 |date=1992}}</ref> These are tabulated below with their population at the [[2010 Indonesian census|2010 Census]]<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and [[2020 Indonesian census|2020 Census]],<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> together with the official estimates as at mid 2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Salatiga Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.3373)</ref> The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centes, the number of [[administrative village]]s (all classed as urban ''kelurahan'') within each district, and its post codes.
