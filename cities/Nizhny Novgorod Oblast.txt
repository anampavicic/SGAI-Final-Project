'''Nizhny Novgorod Oblast''' ({{langx|ru|Нижегородская область|Nizhegorodskaya oblast'}}) is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]] (an [[oblast]]). Its [[administrative center]] is the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of [[Nizhny Novgorod]]. It has a population of 3,119,115 as of the [[2021 Russian census|2021 Census]]. From 1932 to 1990 it was known as '''Gorky Oblast''' ({{langx|ru|Горьковская область}}).

The oblast is crossed by the [[Volga River]]. Apart from Nizhny Novgorod's metropolitan area (including [[Dzerzhinsk, Russia|Dzerzhinsk]], [[Bor, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Bor]] and [[Kstovo]]) the biggest city is [[Arzamas]]. Near the town of [[Sarov]] there is the [[Serafimo-Diveyevsky Monastery]], one of the largest convents in Russia, established by [[Seraphim of Sarov|Saint Seraphim of Sarov]]. The [[Makaryev Monastery]] opposite of the town of [[Lyskovo, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Lyskovo]] used to be the location of the largest fair in Eastern Europe.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Other historic towns include [[Gorodets, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Gorodets]] and [[Balakhna]], located on the [[Volga]] to the north from Nizhny Novgorod.

==Geography==
[[File:Nizhny Novgorod Oblast map.png|thumb|150px|right|Map of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast]]
The oblast covers an area of {{convert|76900|km2|sp=us}}, which is approximately equal to the entire area of the [[Benelux|Benelux countries]] or [[Czech Republic]]. Agricultural land occupies 41% of this area; forests, 48%, lakes and rivers, 2%; and other lands, 9%. Nizhny Novgorod Oblast borders [[Kostroma Oblast]] (N), [[Kirov Oblast]] (NE), the [[Mari El Republic]] (E), the [[Chuvash Republic]] (E), the [[Republic of Mordovia]] (S), [[Ryazan Oblast]] (SW), [[Vladimir Oblast]] (W), and [[Ivanovo Oblast]] (NW).

===Natural resources===
Nizhny Novgorod Oblast is not rich in natural resources, which are limited to commercial deposits of sand (including titanium-zirconium sands), [[clay]], [[gypsum]], [[peat]], mineral [[salt]], and [[timber]].

==History==
The sites of Pustyn I and the settlement of Naumovka I, Krasny Bor 5 and others belong to the Mesolithic era in the Nizhny Novgorod region. Burial grounds of the Fatyanovo culture of the Bronze Age were found in the Chkalovsky, Vetluzhsky and Krasnobakovsky districts.<ref>''Т. Д. Николаенко''. «Археологическая карта России: Нижегородская область» // Москва, 2004.</ref>

In the course of the regional reform of [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] in 1708, Nizhny Novgorod with the surrounding lands was added to the [[Kazan Governorate]]. In 1714, the [[Nizhny Novgorod Governorate]] was created.

On January 14, 1929, the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast was formed.<ref>[http://www.knowbysight.info/1_RSFSR/00312.asp Нижегородская губерния]</ref> On July 15 of the same year, it was transformed into the Nizhny Novgorod Territory.

On October 7, 1932, the Nizhny Novgorod Territory was renamed the Gorky Territory (in honor of the writer Maxim Gorky). On December 5, 1936, the Gorky Territory was transformed into the Gorky Oblast (the Mari and Chuvash Republics were taken from the former territory).<ref>[http://www.knowbysight.info/1_RSFSR/00063.asp Нижегородская область - Нижегородский - Горьковский край - Горьковская - Нижегородская область]</ref>

On January 7, 1954, the Arzamas Oblast was separated from the Gorky Oblast. On April 23, 1957, the Arzamas Oblast was abolished, and its territory was returned to the Gorky Oblast.

On October 22, 1990, by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR, the Gorky Oblast was renamed the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.cntd.ru/document/901860327|title=Указ Президиума Верховного Совета РСФСР от 22 октября 1990 года «О переименовании города Горького в город Нижний Новгород и Горьковской области в Нижегородскую область»|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20160113104811/http://docs.cntd.ru/document/901860327|archivedate=January 13, 2016|access-date=January 22, 2022|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.government-nnov.ru/?id=2081|url-status=dead|title=Общество &#124; Информация о Нижегородской области &#124; История Нижегородского края &#124; Советский период &#124; Административно-территориальное устройство|publisher=Правительство Нижегородской области|accessdate=2016-01-13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130233927/http://www.government-nnov.ru/?id=2081|archivedate=2016-01-30}}</ref> On April 21, 1992, the Congress of People's Deputies of Russia approved the decision of the presidium of the parliament to rename the region, amending Art. 71 of the Constitution of the RSFSR of 1978,<ref>[http://constitution.garant.ru/history/ussr-rsfsr/1978/zakony/183094/chapter/89300effb84a59912210b23abe10a68f/ Закон Российской Федерации от 21 апреля 1992 года № 2708-I «Об изменениях и дополнениях Конституции (Основного Закона) Российской Советской Федеративной Социалистической Республики»]</ref> which entered into force on May 16, 1992.<ref>[http://www.politika.su/doc/zak90a.html Законы РСФСР/РФ 1990—1993 и поправки к ним до весны 1995]</ref>

==Politics==
[[File:NN 01-09-2021 20.jpg|thumb|[[Legislative Assembly of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Nizhny Novgorod House of Legislative Assembly]] in the [[Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin]], 2013]]

During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: the first secretary of the Nizhny Novgorod (then Gorki) [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] Committee (who in reality had the greatest authority); the chairman of the oblast [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]] (legislative power); and the chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). After the abolition of Article 6 of the Constitution of the USSR in March 1990, the CPSU lost its monopoly on power. The head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor, was appointed/elected alongside the elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

The Charter of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast is the province's standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].
