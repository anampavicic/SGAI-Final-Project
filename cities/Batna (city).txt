'''Batna''' ({{langx|ar|باتنة}}) is the main city and [[communes of Algeria|commune]] of [[Batna Province]], [[Algeria]]. With a population of 290,645 (2008 census)<ref name="census2008">{{cite web|title=Population: Batna Wilaya |url=http://www.ons.dz/collections/w05_p1.pdf |publisher=Office National des Statistiques Algérie |access-date=3 March 2013 |language=fr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527081657/http://www.ons.dz/collections/w05_p1.pdf |archive-date=27 May 2013 }}</ref> it is the fifth largest city in Algeria. It is also one of the principal cities of the [[Chaoui]] area and is considered the capital of [[Aurès]].

==History==
{{See also|:fr:Chronologie de la ville de Batna}}

Batna was inhabited by [[Chaoui people|Chaoui]] tribes and there were previous settlements in the area but they were in ruins by the 18th century. The first solid foundations (a military encampment) of the city were erected by a French garrison in 1844, with a strategic mission to create a permanently guarded access point for the main Sahara road.
Batna's geographical location offers a natural break through the [[Atlas Mountains]]. The ancient cities of [[Timgad]] and [[Lambese]], built around the first century CE, are living examples of the importance that the Romans gave to commercial control over the region.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

=== Signature and proclamation of the Algerian revolution Batna===
[[File:L'APC de Batna.JPG|thumb|left|The Municipal People's Assembly]]
[[File:Martyrs' Square Batna 22.jpg|thumb|Martyrs' Square of Batna]]
The inhabitants of the city revolted  against the French authorities at the beginning of colonization. Thereafter they organized the Algerian revolution against French colonialism.

The first Batneens adhered to [[Messali Hadj]] (PPP), as did the Ulemas [[Abdelhamid Ben Badis|Ben Badis]] and the Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Freedoms (MTLD), and together they organized the great historic summit of 22, June 25, 1954.

The Algerian revolution started at Batna under the chairmanship of Batnéen [[Mustapha Benboulaïd]] (FLN). Batna was the [[1st Military Region (Algeria)|first military region of Algeria (zone 1)]] (1954–1962). 

On the night of November 1, 1954, the barracks of the city of Batna were attacked by the mujahedeen. 
Batna was the command headquarters of the Algerian revolution until independence.<ref>War in Algeria, Mohammmde Hardi, Benjamamin Stora edition Robert Laffont</ref>
