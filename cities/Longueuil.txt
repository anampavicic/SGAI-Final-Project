'''Longueuil''' ({{IPA|fr|lɔ̃ɡœj|-|LL-Q150 (fra)-DenisdeShawi-Longueuil.wav}}) is a city in the province of [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]. It is the seat of the [[Montérégie|Montérégie administrative region]] and the central city of the [[urban agglomeration of Longueuil]]. It sits on the [[South Shore (Montreal)|south shore]] of the [[Saint Lawrence River]] directly across from [[Montreal]]. The population as of the [[Canada 2021 Census]] totalled 254,483, making it Montreal's second largest suburb, the fifth most populous city in Quebec and [[List of the largest municipalities in Canada by population|twentieth]] largest in Canada.

[[Charles le Moyne de Longueuil et de Châteauguay|Charles Le Moyne]] founded Longueuil  as a ''[[Seigneurial system of New France|seigneurie]]'' in 1657. It would become a parish in 1845, a village in 1848, a town in 1874 and a city in 1920. Between  1961 and 2002, Longueuil's borders grew three times, as it was amalgamated with surrounding municipalities; there was a strong de-amalgamation in 2006 (see [[2000–2006 municipal reorganization in Quebec]]).

Longueuil is a residential, commercial and industrial city. It incorporates some [[urban area|urban]] features, but is essentially a [[suburb]]. Longueuil can be classified as a [[commuter town]] as a large portion of its residents commute to work in Montreal. Most buildings are single-family homes constructed in the post-war period. The city consists of three boroughs: [[Le Vieux-Longueuil]], [[Saint-Hubert, Quebec|Saint-Hubert]] and [[Greenfield Park, Quebec|Greenfield Park]].

Longueuil is the seat of the [[Judicial districts of Quebec|judicial district]] of Longueuil.<ref>[http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&file=/D_11/D11_A.HTM ''Territorial Division Act'']. ''Revised Statutes of Quebec'' D-11.</ref> Residents of the city are called ''Longueuillois''.

==History==
{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}
[[File:Fort Longueuil 1825.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of [[Fort Longueuil]] in 1825.]]
The territory of [[New France]] was divided into [[Seigneurial system of New France|seigneuries]] in order to ensure the colony's defence. Longueuil was founded in 1657 by [[Charles le Moyne de Longueuil et de Châteauguay|Charles Le Moyne]], a merchant from [[Fort Ville-Marie|Ville-Marie]] (present day Montreal), as a [[Seigneurial system of New France|seigneurie]].<ref name="CanadianEncyclopedia">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/longueuil|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621193429/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/longueuil|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 21, 2012|title=Longueuil|last=LINTEAU|first=PAUL-ANDRÉ|author2=CLAIRE POITRAS |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|publisher=[[Historica-Dominion Institute]]|access-date=25 February 2012}}</ref> According to Abbé Faillon, Charles Le Moyne, lord of the area starting in 1657, named Longueuil after the village of [[Longueil, Seine-Maritime|Longueil]] (note slightly different spelling) which is today the seat of a canton in the district of [[Dieppe, France|Dieppe]] in his homeland of [[Normandy]].

His son, [[Charles le Moyne de Longueuil, Baron de Longueuil|Charles Le Moyne de Longueuil]], built [[Fort Longueuil]] as his fortified residence. It was constructed of stone between 1685 and 1690 and had four towers.<ref name="CRHP">{{CRHP|14401|Fort Longueuil|7 April 2012}}</ref>

Fort Longueuil was believed to be occupied by [[United States|American]] troops during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. It was subsequently occupied by the [[United Kingdom|British]]. It was demolished in  1810 due to its poor condition.<ref name="CRHP" /> The [[Archaeology|archaeological remains]] of Fort Longueuil were recognized as a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] on May 25, 1923.  The site extends beneath the present-day [[Co-Cathedral of Saint-Antoine-de-Padoue|Saint-Antoine-de-Padoue Cathedral]].<ref name="CRHP" />
[[File:The church and Rue St. Charles, Longueuil, QC, about 1910.jpg|thumbnail|left|The [[Co-Cathedral of Saint-Antoine-de-Padoue]] and Rue St. Charles, Longueuil, QC, about 1910]]
The seigneurial system ended in 1845 and Longueuil was turned into a [[parish municipality (Quebec)|parish municipality]] named Saint-Antoine-de-Longueuil.<ref name="CanadianEncyclopedia"/> In 1848, a portion detached from the parish and officially established as the [[Old Longueuil|village of Longueuil]]. This same village became a town in 1874, and then a city in 1920.<ref name="CanadianEncyclopedia"/> Musician [[Paul Pratt]] notably served as the city's mayor from 1935 to 1966.

Longueuil's city limits expanded for the first time in 1961 when it merged with [[Montréal-Sud]], and again in 1969 when it merged with [[Ville Jacques-Cartier]].<ref name="CanadianEncyclopedia"/> In both cases,  Longueuil was chosen as the name of the new city.

On January 1, 2002, as part of the [[2000–2006 municipal reorganization in Quebec]], the provincial government amalgamated [[Le Vieux-Longueuil|the former Longueuil]] with [[Boucherville]], [[Brossard]], [[Greenfield Park, Quebec|Greenfield Park]], [[LeMoyne, Quebec|LeMoyne]], [[Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville]], [[Saint-Hubert, Quebec|Saint-Hubert]] and [[Saint-Lambert, Quebec|Saint-Lambert]]. As with the 1960s, the name Longueuil was chosen for the new city.  However, after a [[2003 Quebec general election|change of government]] and a [[2004 Quebec municipal referendums|2004 referendum]], Boucherville, Brossard, Saint-Lambert and Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville were re-constituted as independent cities on January 1, 2006.  As such, the current city of Longueuil now includes only the former cities of Longueuil (1969–2002), Saint-Hubert, Greenfield Park and LeMoyne.

==Geography==
[[File:Longueuil Quebec location diagram.PNG|thumb|left|Location of the city of Longueuil within the [[Urban Agglomeration of Longueuil]].]]
Longueuil occupies 115.59&nbsp;square kilometres (44.6&nbsp;sq mi) of land. The city is bordered by the cities of [[Saint-Lambert, Quebec|Saint-Lambert]] to the west, [[Brossard]] to the southwest, [[Boucherville]]  to the northeast, [[Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville]] to the east, and the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and Montreal to the northwest. The city of Longueuil is located approximately 7&nbsp;kilometres (5&nbsp;mi) east of [[Montreal]] on the [[South Shore (Montreal)|south shore]] of the [[Saint Lawrence River]].

Longueuil is located in the Saint Lawrence River [[valley]], and is a vast [[plain]]. Areas near the river were originally [[swamp]] land with [[mixed forest]], and later prime agricultural land. Agricultural land still exists in the portions of the city furthest from the river.

The city of Longueuil also includes [[Île Charron]], a small [[island]] in the Saint Lawrence River, and part of the [[Boucherville Islands]].

Street addresses in Longueuil increase west and east from the Chemin de Chambly, with suffixes of "Ouest" and "Est" used on east–west streets that cross it, and south from the Saint Lawrence River. (As in Montreal, the local cardinal directions are skewed to align with the shore of the river, and local grid "north" is closer to geographic northwest.)

===Climate===
Like [[Montreal]], Longueuil is classified as [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] or [[hemiboreal]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfb''). Longueuil has long winters, lasting from November to March, short springs during April and May, average summers, lasting from June to August, and short autumns during September and October.

===Roads===
[[File:Boulevard Jacques-Cartier, Longueuil 01.jpg|alt=|thumb|Boulevard Jacques-Cartier Est, at the intersection of boulevard Roland-Therrien]]
The [[Saint Lawrence River]] between the [[Island of Montreal]] and the south shore is traversed by only five automobile crossings. Two of these are in Longueuil, the [[Louis Hippolyte Lafontaine Tunnel]] (part of [[Quebec Autoroute 25|Autoroute 25]]) and the [[Jacques Cartier Bridge]] (part of [[Quebec Route 134|Route 134]]).

[[Quebec Autoroute 20|Autoroute 20]] is an important highway in Longueuil, bordering the Saint Lawrence River in the [[Le Vieux-Longueuil]] borough, where it co-exists with Autoroute René-Lévesque (Route 132), and finally heading eastward toward [[Boucherville]]. [[Quebec Autoroute 30|Autoroute 30]] crosses the [[Saint-Hubert, Quebec|Saint-Hubert]] borough in the southern part of the city, between the cities of [[Brossard]] and [[Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville]].

[[Quebec Route 134|Route 134]] is a major artery, perhaps better known by its more common names: the Jacques Cartier Bridge on the portion crossing the Saint-Lawrence River, and [[Taschereau Boulevard]] which connects the bridge to all three boroughs of Longueuil, and southward toward the city of Brossard.
