'''Puducherry''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ʊ|d|ᵿ|ˈ|tʃ|ɛr|i}}; {{IPA|ta|puðut͡ːʃeːɾi|lang}}), also known as '''Pondicherry''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɒ|n|d|ᵻ|ˈ|tʃ|ɛr|i}}; {{IPA|ta|paːɳɖit͡ːʃeːɾi|lang}}), is a [[union territory]] of [[India]], consisting of four small geographically unconnected districts. It was formed out of four territories of former [[French India]], namely [[Puducherry district|Pondichéry]]  (now Puducherry), [[Karaikal district|Karikal]] (Karaikal), [[Mahé district|Mahé]] and [[Yanaon]] (now [[Yanam district|Yanam]]), excluding [[Chandannagar]] (Chandernagore), and it is named after the largest district, Puducherry, which was also the capital of French India. Historically known as Pondicherry ({{transliteration|ta|ISO|Pāṇṭiccēri}}), the territory [[Renaming of cities in India|changed its official name]] to Puducherry on 1 October 2006.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5365248.stm |title=South Asia &#124; New name for old French territory |work=BBC News |date=20 September 2006 |access-date=10 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222055544/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5365248.stm |archive-date=22 February 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/08/22/stories/2006082207481000.htm |title=National : Bill to rename Pondicherry as Puducherry passed |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=22 August 2006 |access-date=10 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021123517/http://www.hindu.com/2006/08/22/stories/2006082207481000.htm |archive-date=21 October 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

The Union Territory of Puducherry lies in the [[South India|southern part]] of the Indian Peninsula. The areas of [[Puducherry district]] and [[Karaikal district]] are bound by the state of [[Tamil Nadu]], while [[Yanam district]] and [[Mahé district]] are enclosed by the states of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Kerala]], respectively. Puducherry is the 29th most populous of the 36 states and union territories of India, and the third most densely populated union territory.

==Name==
The name ''Puducherry'' is a compound of the Tamil words {{lang|ta-Latn|putu}} ({{lang|ta|புது}}) and {{lang|ta-Latn|cēri}} ({{lang|ta|சேரி}}) meaning 'new slum'; its old name ''Pondicherry'' is a [[gallicised]] version of {{lang|ta-Latn|Pāṇḍi-cēri}} ({{lang|ta|பாண்டிச்சேரி}}) meaning 'slum of Pandis'.

Puducherry has five official names, owing to its linguistic diversity, past-French heritage and the legacy of British India.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GwsNAQAAMAAJ |title=Parliamentary Debates: Official Report, Volume 208, Issues 18–19 |date=2006 |page=263 |publisher=Council of States Secretariat |access-date=8 August 2022}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Main|History of Puducherry}}
The earliest recorded history of the [[Pondicherry|municipality of Puducherry]] can be traced to the second century CE. The ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' mentions a marketplace named ''Poduke or Poduka'' (ch 60). [[G. W. B. Huntingford]] suggested this might be a site about 2 miles from the modern Puducherry, which was possibly the location of [[Arikamedu]] (now part of [[Ariyankuppam]]). Huntingford noted that Roman pottery was found at Arikamedu in 1937. In addition, [[archeology|archaeological]] excavations between 1944 and 1949 showed that it was "a trading station to which goods of Roman manufacture were imported during the first half of the 1st century" Subsequent investigation by Vimala Begley from 1989 to 1992 modified this assessment, and now place the period of occupation from the third or second century BCE to the eighth century CE.<ref>

[[File:French India 1815.gif|left|thumb|French Indian Colonies in 1815 ]]
In 1674, the municipality of Pondicherry (Pondichéry) became a colony in the [[French colonial empire]]. Together with [[Chandannagar|Chandernagor]] (already French since 1673), [[Mahé, Puducherry|Mahé]] (since 1721), [[Yanam]] ([[Yanaon]]) (since 1723), [[Karaikal]] (Karikal) (since 1739) and [[Masulipatam]] (1760), it formed the colony of [[French India]], under a single French governor in Pondicherry, although French rule over one or more of these enclaves was repeatedly interrupted by [[United Kingdom|British]] occupations. The territories of French India were completely transferred to the Republic of India ''[[de facto]]'' on 1 November 1954, and ''[[de jure]]'' on 16 August 1962, when French India ceased to exist, becoming the present Indian union territory of Pondicherry, combining four coastal enclaves. The fifth, [[Chandannagar]], merged with the state of [[West Bengal]] in 1954. Immediately after the ''de facto'' transfer, the area was renamed the 'State of Pondicherry' by the "French Establishments (Change of Name) Order, 1954" issued by the [[Ministry of External Affairs of India]].<ref name="CriminalJustice2005">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Axfuc5A8mxMC|title=Criminal Justice India Series: Pondicherry|section= D.Banerjea|volume=20|publisher=Allied Publishers|year=2005|isbn=978-8177648713}}</ref>{{rp|37}} The State of Pondicherry continued to be under the direct control of the [[Government of India]] under the aegis of the Ministry of External affairs until 31 August 1964. Meanwhile, with effect from 1 July 1963, the State of Pondicherry officially became the Union Territory of Pondicherry and after 31 August 1964 it came under the control of the Ministry of Home Affairs.<ref name="CriminalJustice2005"/>{{rp|37}}

Until 2016, the ''de jure transfer day'' (i.e. 16 August) was a public holiday with no official celebrations taking place.<ref name=newsminute>{{cite news |last=Mathew |first=Pheba |date=16 August 2016 |title=Liberated from France 55 years ago, Puducherry celebrated 'De Jure Day' for the first time ever |url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/liberated-france-55-years-ago-puducherry-celebrates-de-jure-day-first-time-ever-48445 |work= The News Minute |access-date=3 July 2022}}</ref><ref name=DejureTransferDay2021>{{cite web|date=16 August 2016 |title=68th De Facto Merger Day of Puducherry to Be Celebrated on November 1 |url=https://www.news18.com/news/politics/68th-de-facto-merger-day-of-puducherry-to-be-celebrated-on-november-1-4387469.html|publisher= News18 |access-date=3 July 2022}}</ref> In 2016, [[List of lieutenant governors of Puducherry|Lt.

==Geography==
[[File:Puducherry Map.svg|thumb|left|Map showing the districts of Puducherry]]
{{further|List of rivers of Puducherry}}
The Union Territory of Puducherry consists of [[List of districts of Puducherry|four small unconnected districts]]: [[Puducherry district]] ({{cvt|293|sqkm|sqmi|disp=or}}), [[Karaikal district]] ({{cvt|161|sqkm|sqmi|disp=or}}) and [[Yanam district]] ({{cvt|20|sqkm|sqmi|disp=or}}) on the [[Bay of Bengal]] and [[Mahé district]] ({{cvt|9|sqkm|sqmi|disp=or}}) on the [[Laccadive Sea]], covering a total area of {{cvt|483|sqkm|sqmi}}. Puducherry and Karaikal have the largest areas and population, and are both [[enclaves]] of [[Tamil Nadu]]. Yanam and Mahé are enclaves of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Kerala]], respectively. Its population, as per the [[2011 Census of India|2011 Census]], is 1,394,467. Puducherry is the smallest union territory in terms of sea coastline with 30.6&nbsp;km length.

Some of Puducherry's regions are themselves amalgamations of non-contiguous enclaves, often called "pockets" in India. The Puducherry region is made of 11 such pockets, some of which are very small and entirely surrounded by the territory of Tamil Nadu. Mahé region is made up of three pockets. This unusual geography is a legacy of the [[Colonialism|colonial period]] with Puducherry retaining the borders of former [[French India]].

All four regions of Puducherry are located in the coastal region. Five rivers in [[Puducherry district]], seven in [[Karaikal district]], two in [[Mahé district]] and one in [[Yanam district]] drain into the sea, but none originates within the territory.

==Districts==

* [[Puducherry district|Pondicherry district]] is an enclave of [[Tamil Nadu]], also serves as the capital of Union Territory of Puducherry.
* [[Karaikal district]] is an enclave of [[Tamil Nadu]].
* [[Mahé district]] is an enclave of [[Kerala]].
* [[Yanam district]] is an enclave of [[Andhra Pradesh]].

Puducherry is a [[union territory]] of India rather than a state, which implies that governance and administration fall directly under federal authority. It is one of three union territories (with the [[Delhi|National Capital Territory of Delhi]] and [[Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Jammu and Kashmir]]) entitled by a [[Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of India|special constitutional amendment]] to an elected legislative assembly and cabinet of ministers, thereby conveying partial statehood.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lankabbc.com/blog/tag/pondicherry |title=Lanka BBC Info Know Puducherry: Government Name Pondicherry As Puducherry |website=lankabbc.com |date=29 June 2012 |access-date=24 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202235835/https://lankabbc.com/blog/tag/pondicherry/ |archive-date=2 February 2017 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> There has been some interest by the territory's government in receiving full statehood, but budgetary issues remain a consideration. Also, Mahe and Yanam may oppose such a change of status.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2018/jul/26/will-pondys-attempt-to-get-statehood-succeed-1848833.html|title=Will Pondy's attempt to get statehood succeed?|website=The New Indian Express|date=26 July 2018 }}</ref>

The central government is represented by the [[List of lieutenant governors of Puducherry|Lieutenant Governor]], who resides at the [[Raj Niwas, Pondicherry|Raj Nivas]] (Le Palais du Gouverneur) at the Park, the former palace of the French governor. The central government is more directly involved in the territory's financial well-being unlike states, which have a central grant that they administer. Consequently, Puducherry has at various times, enjoyed lower taxes, especially in the [[indirect taxation|indirect]] category.

=== Special administration status ===

According to the Treaty of Cession of 1956, the [[French India|four territories of former French India]] territorial administration are permitted to make laws with respect to specific matters. In many cases, such legislation may require ratification from the federal government or the assent of the [[President of India]].

Article II of the Treaty states:
<blockquote>{{lang|fr|Ces établissements conserveront le bénéfice du statut administratif spécial en vigueur avant le 1er novembre 1954. Toute modification constitutionnelle à ce statut ne pourra intervenir, le cas échéant, qu’après consultation de la population.}}<br /> (The Establishments will keep the benefit of the special administrative status which was in force prior to 1 November 1954. Any constitutional changes in this status which may be made subsequently shall be made after ascertaining the wishes of the people).</blockquote>

=== Languages ===
{{main article|Official languages of Puducherry}}
The most widely spoken first language is [[Tamil language|Tamil]], which is native to {{sigfig|88.237|3}}% of the population. There are also speakers of [[Telugu language|Telugu]] ({{sigfig|5.9585|2}}%), [[Malayalam]] ({{sigfig|3.8448|2}}%) and [[Urdu]] ({{sigfig|0.6913|1}}%).

Even after the de facto transfer of the French Indian settlements in November 1954, [[French language|French]] continued to remain as the [[official language]] according to Article XXVIII of the {{lang|fr|[[Treaty establishing De Jure Cession of French Establishments in India|Traité de Cession]]}} (Treaty of Cession) of 1956.

Article XXVIII of the Treaty states:
<blockquote>{{lang|fr|Le français restera langue officielle des Établissements aussi longtemps que les répresentants élus de la population n'auront pas pris une décision différente.}}<br /> (The French language shall remain the official language of the Establishments so long as the elected representatives of the people shall not decide otherwise).</blockquote>

The [[Official languages of Puducherry#1963 Resolution by Representative Assembly|1963 Pondicherry representative assembly resolution]] also voted for continuance of French as official language and addition of other languages spoken in Puducherry such as Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam along with English and Hindi.<ref name=1963assemblyresolution/>{{rp|151–152}}

==== Inclusion of other languages ====
Considering the 1956 Treaty of cession and 1963 Assembly resolution, the 1963 Union Territories Act reconfirmed the 1963 resolution that French shall continue to be used as an official language unless the legislative assembly decides otherwise. The 1963 act allowed provision for inclusion of more official languages. Two years later, new official languages were recognised by The Pondicherry Official Language Act, 1965  which makes no mention of French (but also not officially denying it) implying the implicit continuation of its official language status. The same act stated that the Tamil language shall be the language to be used for all or any of the official purposes of the Union territory and the same official recognition is given for English. The same act also recognized officially Malayalam and Telugu in the Mahé and Yanam districts respectively.<ref name="1965act" />

The widespread [[anti-Hindi agitations]] in the mid-1960s in South India would have prompted for inclusion of all the languages suggested in the 1963 assembly resolution except Hindi in the list of official languages of Puducherry. While the Union Territory official gazette's name is in French ({{lang|fr|La Gazette de L'État de Poudouchéry}}), it is published exclusively in English.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gstcouncil.gov.in/sites/default/files/sgst-notification/PUD-(R)-(18)-9.pdf |title=La Gazette de L'État de Poudouchéry The Gazette of Puducherry |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=25 January 2018 |website=www.gstcouncil.gov.in |publisher= |access-date=30 June 2022 |quote=}}</ref>
