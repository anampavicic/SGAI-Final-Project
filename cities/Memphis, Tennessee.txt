=== Early history ===
Occupying a substantial bluff rising from the Mississippi River, the site of Memphis has been a natural location for human settlement by varying indigenous cultures over thousands of years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/mississippian-period-overview |title=Mississippian Period: Overview |website= New Georgia Encyclopedia |access-date=July 13, 2017}}</ref> In the first millennium A.D. people of the [[Mississippian culture]] were prominent; the culture influenced a network of communities throughout the Mississippi River Valley and its tributaries.

French explorers led by [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Magness, Perre |date=2011 |title=Fort Prudhomme and La Salle |journal=Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture (Online, February 16 Update) |location=Knoxville, TN |publisher=[[University of Tennessee Press]]; [[Tennessee Historical Society]] |url=http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=495 |access-date=December 2, 2015}}</ref> and Spanish explorer [[Hernando de Soto]]<ref>WISSLER, Clark (1993) ''Los indios de Estados Unidos de América,'' Paidós Studio, nº 104 Barcelona</ref><ref>HALE, Duane K & GIBSON, Arrell M.

J. D. L. Holmes, writing in Hudson's ''Four Centuries of Southern Indians'' (2007), notes that this site was a third strategic point in the late 18th century through which European powers could control United States encroachment beyond the Appalachians and their interference with Indian matters—after [[History of Vicksburg, Mississippi|Fort Nogales]] (present-day [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]]) and [[Fort Tombecbe|Fort Confederación]] (present-day [[Epes, Alabama]]): "Chickasaw Bluffs, located on the Mississippi River at the present-day location of Memphis.

In 1795 the Spanish Governor-General of [[Louisiana]], [[Francisco Luis Héctor de Carondelet]], sent his lieutenant governor, [[Manuel Gayoso de Lemos]], to negotiate and secure consent from the local Chickasaw so that a Spanish fort could be erected on the bluff; [[Fort San Fernando De Las Barrancas]] was the result.<ref name=Holmes2007 />{{rp|71}}<ref>{{cite journal |author = Harkins, John E. |date = 2010 |title = Fort San Fernando De Las Barrancas |journal = Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture (Online, January 1 Update) |location = Knoxville, Tennessee, USA |publisher = University of Tennessee Press, Tennessee Historical Society |url = http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=496s |access-date = December 2, 2015 |quote = Louisiana Governor-General Carondelet sent Lieutenant Governor Manuel Gayoso de Lemos to secure the Chickasaws' consent and then erect a fort on the bluff site. |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193914/http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=496s |archive-date = March 3, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Holmes notes that consent was reached despite opposition from "disappointed Americans and a pro-American faction of the Chickasaws" when the "pro-Spanish faction signed the Chickasaw Bluffs Cession and Spain provided the Chickasaws with a trading post".<ref name=Holmes2007 />{{rp|71}}

Fort San Fernando de las Barrancas remained a focal point of Spanish activity until, as Holmes summarizes:
<blockquote>[T]he Treaty of San Lorenzo or [[Pinckney's Treaty]] of 1795 [implemented in March 1797], [had as its result that] all of the careful, diplomatic work by Spanish officials in [[Louisiana territory|Louisiana]] and [[West Florida]], which has succeeded for a decade in controlling the Indians [e.g., the [[Choctaws]]], was undone. The United States gained the right to navigate the [[Mississippi River]] and won control over the [[Yazoo lands|Yazoo Strip]] north of the thirty-first parallel.<ref name=Holmes2007 />{{rp|75,71}}</blockquote>

The Spanish dismantled the fort, shipping its lumber and iron to their locations in Arkansas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2916|title=European Exploration and Settlement, 1541 through 1802 – Encyclopedia of Arkansas|website=Encyclopediaofarkansas.net|access-date=September 10, 2016}}</ref>

In 1796, the site became the westernmost point of the newly admitted state of Tennessee, in what was then called the Southwest United States. The area was still largely occupied and controlled by the Chickasaw nation. Captain Isaac Guion led an American force down the Ohio River to claim the land, arriving on July 20, 1797. By this time, the Spanish had departed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wknofm.org/post/fort-san-fernando-de-las-barrancas|title=Fort San Fernando De Las Barrancas|author=Steve Pike|work=wknofm.org|date=July 23, 2013|access-date=December 2, 2015}}</ref> The fort's ruins went unnoticed 20 years later when Memphis was laid out as a city after the United States government paid the Chickasaw for land.<ref name="Patrick1990">{{cite book|last=Patrick|first=James|title=Architecture in Tennessee, 1768–1897|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JOIMXAKnCfAC&pg=PA77|access-date=March 25, 2011|date=March 1990|publisher=Univ. of Tennessee Press |isbn = 978-0-87049-631-8 |page=77}}</ref>

[[File:Memphis Tennessee 1850s.jpg|thumb|Memphis in the mid-1850s]]

At the beginning of the century, as recognized by the [[United States]] in [[Treaty of Hopewell|1786 Treaty of Hopewell]], the land still belonged to the [[Chickasaw|Chickasaw Nation]]. In the [[Treaty of Tuscaloosa]], signed in October 1818 and ratified by Congress on January 7, 1819, the Chickasaw ceded their territory in Western Tennessee to the [[United States]]. The city of Memphis was founded less than five months after the U.S. takeover of the territory, on May 22, 1819 (incorporated December 19, 1826), by [[John Overton (judge)|John Overton]], [[James Winchester (general)|James Winchester]] and [[Andrew Jackson]].<ref name="TNencyOverton">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=1029 |title=TN Encyclopedia: John Overton |access-date=October 24, 2008 |encyclopedia=The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture}}</ref><ref name="MemLib">{{cite web|url=http://www.memphislibrary.lib.tn.us/history/memphis2.htm |title=Memphis History and Facts |access-date=October 24, 2008 |publisher=Memphis Public Library |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927040837/http://www.memphislibrary.lib.tn.us/history/memphis2.htm |archive-date=September 27, 2007}}</ref> They named it after the [[Memphis, Egypt|ancient capital]] of [[Egypt]] on the [[Nile River]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Stewart |first= George R. |author-link= George R.

From the city's foundation onwards, [[African Americans]] formed large proportion of Memphis' population. Prior to [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|the abolition]] of [[slavery in the United States]], most Black people in Memphis were enslaved, being used as [[Forced labour|forced labor]] by white enslavers along the river or on outlying [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|cotton plantations]] in the [[Mississippi Delta]]. The city's demographics changed dramatically in the 1850s and 1860s, due to waves of immigration and domestic migration. Due to increased immigration since the 1840s and the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]], [[Irish Americans]] made up 9.9% of the population in 1850, but 23.2% by 1860, when the total population was 22,623.<ref>Carriere, Marius.

[[Tennessee#History|Tennessee]] seceded from the [[United States|Union]] in June 1861, and Memphis briefly became a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] stronghold. [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[Ironclad warship|ironclad gunboats]] captured it in the naval [[First Battle of Memphis|Battle of Memphis]] on June 6, 1862, and the city and state were occupied by the [[Union Army]] for the duration of the war. Union commanders allowed the city to maintain its civil government during most of this period but excluded [[Confederate States Army]] veterans from office. This shifted political dynamics in the city as the war went on.<ref name="carden">[http://mercatus.org/sites/default/files/publication/WP1040_An%20Unrighteous%20Piece%20of%20Business.pdf Art Carden and Christopher J. Coyne, "An Unrighteous Piece of Business: A New Institutional Analysis of the Memphis Riot of 1866"], Mercatus Center, George Mason University, July 2010, accessed February 1, 2014</ref>

The war years contributed to additional dramatic changes in the city population. The Union Army's presence attracted many [[Fugitive slaves in the United States|fugitive slaves]] who had escaped from surrounding rural plantations. So many sought protection behind Union lines that the Army set up [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contraband camps]] to accommodate them. Memphis's black population increased from 3,000 in 1860, when the total population was 22,623, to nearly 20,000 in 1865, with most settling south of the city limits.<ref name="Ryan">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2716953 Ryan, James G.

The rapid demographic changes added to the stress of war and occupation and uncertainty about who was in charge, increasing tensions between the city's ethnic Irish policemen and black Union soldiers after the war.<ref name="carden" /> In three days of rioting in early May 1866, the [[Memphis Riots of 1866|Memphis Riots]] erupted, in which white mobs made up of policemen, firemen, and other mostly ethnic [[Irish Americans]] attacked and killed 46 blacks, wounding 75 and injuring 100; raped several women; and destroyed nearly 100 houses while severely damaging churches and schools in South Memphis. Much of the black settlement was left in ruins. Two whites were killed in the riot.<ref name="Ryan" /> Many blacks permanently fled Memphis afterward, especially as the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] continued to have difficulty in protecting them. Their population fell to about 15,000 by 1870,<ref name="carden" /> 37.4% of the total population of 40,226.

Historian Barrington Walker suggests that the Irish rioted against blacks because of their relatively recent arrival as immigrants and the uncertain nature of their own claim to "whiteness"; they were trying to distinguish themselves from blacks in the underclass. The main fighting participants were ethnic Irish, decommissioned black Union soldiers, and newly emancipated African-American [[freedmen]]. Walker suggests that most of the mob was not in direct economic conflict with the blacks, as by then the Irish had attained better jobs, but were establishing social and political dominance over the freedmen.<ref name="Walker" />

Unlike the disturbances in some other cities, ex-Confederate veterans were generally not part of the attacks against blacks in Memphis. As a result of the riots in Memphis, and a similar one in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] in September, Congress passed the [[Reconstruction Act]] and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]].<ref name="Ryan" />

=== Yellow fever epidemics ===
{{main article|Lower Mississippi Valley yellow fever epidemic of 1878}}
In the 1870s, a series of [[yellow fever]] [[epidemic]]s devastated Memphis, with the disease carried by river passengers traveling by ships along the waterways. During the Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1878, more than 5,000 people were listed in the official register of deaths between July 26 and November 27. The vast majority died of yellow fever, making the epidemic in the city of 40,000 one of the most traumatic and severe in urban U.S. history. Within four days of the Memphis Board of Health's declaration of a yellow fever outbreak, 20,000 residents fled the city. The ensuing panic left the poverty-stricken, the working classes, and the African-American community at the most risk from the epidemic. Those who remained relied on volunteers from religious and physician organizations to tend to the sick. By the end of the year, more than 5,000 were confirmed dead in Memphis. The New Orleans health board listed "not less than 4,600" dead. The Mississippi Valley recorded 120,000 cases of yellow fever, with 20,000 deaths. The $15 million in losses caused by the epidemic bankrupted Memphis, and as a result, its charter was revoked by the state legislature.

[[File:AmCyc Memphis (Tennessee).jpg|thumb|Woodcut representing the waterfront of Memphis, {{Circa|1879}}]]
By 1870, Memphis's population of 40,000 was almost double that of Nashville and Atlanta, and it was the second-largest city in the South after New Orleans.<ref name="Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006">[[Molly Caldwell Crosby|Crosby, Molly Caldwell]]. ''The American Plague: The Untold Story of Yellow Fever, the Epidemic That Shaped Our History''. New York: [[Berkley Books]], 2006.</ref> Its population continued to grow after 1870, even when the [[Panic of 1873]] hit the US hard, particularly in the South. The Panic of 1873 resulted in expanding Memphis's underclasses amid the poverty and hardship it wrought, giving further credence to Memphis as a rough, shiftless city. Leading up to the outbreak in 1878, it had suffered two yellow fever epidemics, [[cholera]], and [[malaria]], giving it a reputation as sickly and filthy. It was unheard of for a city with a population as large as Memphis's not to have any waterworks; the city still relied for supplies entirely on collecting water from the river and rain cisterns, and had no way to remove sewage.<ref name="Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006" /> The combination of a swelling population, especially of lower and working classes, and abysmal health and sanitary conditions made Memphis ripe for a serious epidemic.

Kate Bionda, an owner of an Italian "snack house", died of a fever on August 13, 1878.<ref name="Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006" /> Hers was officially reported by the Board of Health, on August 14, as the first case of yellow fever in the city.<ref name="Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006" /> A massive panic ensued. The same trains and steamboats that had brought thousands into Memphis, in five days carried away more than 25,000 refugees, more than half of the city's population.<ref name="Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006" /> On August 23, the Board of Health finally declared a yellow fever epidemic in Memphis, and the city collapsed, hemorrhaging its population. In July of that year, the city had a population of 47,000; by September, 19,000 remained, and 17,000 of them had yellow fever.<ref name="Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006" /> The only people left in the city were the lower classes, such as German and Irish immigrant workers and African Americans. None had the means to flee the city, as did the middle and upper-class whites of Memphis, and thus they were subjected to a city of death.

Immediately following the Board of Health's declaration, a Citizen's Relief Committee was formed by Charles G. Fisher. It organized the city into refugee camps. The committee's main priority was to separate the poor from the city and isolate them in refugee camps.<ref name="Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006" /> The Howard Association, formed specifically for yellow fever epidemics in New Orleans and Memphis, organized nurses and doctors in Memphis and throughout the country.<ref name="Hicks, Mildred 1964">Hicks, Mildred. ''Yellow Fever and the Board of Health.'' Memphis, Tennessee: Memphis and Shelby County Health Department, 1964.</ref> They stayed at the [[Peabody Hotel]], the only hotel to keep its doors open during the epidemic. From there they were assigned to their respective districts. Physicians of the epidemic reported seeing as many as 100 to 150 patients daily.<ref name="Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006" />

The Episcopal Community of St. Mary at St. Mary's Episcopal Cathedral<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.communityofstmarysouth.org/about | title=ABOUT }}</ref> played an important role during the epidemic in caring for the lower classes. Already supporting a girls' school and church orphanage, the Sisters of St. Mary also sought to provide care for the Canfield Asylum, a home for black children. Each day, they alternated caring for the orphans at St. Mary's, delivering children to the Canfield Asylum, and taking soup and medicine on house calls to patients.<ref name="Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006" /> Between September 9 and October 4, Sister Constance and three other nuns fell victim to the epidemic and died. They later became known as the Martyrs of Memphis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org |title=Welcomes You |publisher=The Episcopal Church |access-date=July 13, 2017}}</ref>

At long last, on October 28, a killing frost struck. The city sent out word to Memphians scattered all over the country to come home. Though yellow fever cases were recorded in the pages of Elmwood Cemetery's burial record as late as February 29, 1874, the epidemic seemed quieted.<ref name="Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006" /> The Board of Health declared the epidemic at an end after it had caused over 20,000 deaths and financial losses of nearly $200 million.<ref name="Ellis, John H 1992">Ellis, John H. ''Yellow Fever & Public Health in the New South''. Lexington, Kentucky: University Press of Kentucky, 1992.</ref> On November 27, a general citizen's meeting was called at the Greenlaw Opera House to offer thanks to those who had stayed behind to serve, of whom many had died. Over the next year property tax revenues collapsed, and the city could not make payments on its municipal debts. As a result, Memphis temporarily lost its city charter and was reclassified by the state legislature as a Taxing District from 1878 to 1893.<ref name="Hicks, Mildred 1964" /> But a new era of sanitation was developed in the city, a new municipal government in 1879 helped form the first regional health organization, and during the 1880s Memphis led the nation in sanitary reform and improvements.<ref name="Ellis, John H 1992" />

Perhaps the most significant effect of yellow fever on Memphis was in demographic changes. Nearly all of Memphis's upper and middle classes vanished, depriving the city of its general leadership and class structure that dictated everyday life, similar to that in other large Southern cities, such as [[New Orleans]], [[Charleston, South Carolina]], and [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. In Memphis, the poorer whites and blacks fundamentally made up the city and played the greatest role in rebuilding it. The epidemic had resulted in Memphis being a less cosmopolitan place, with an economy that served the cotton trade and a population drawn increasingly from poor white and black Southerners.<ref>Keith, Jeanette. ''Fever Season: The Story of a Terrifying Epidemic and the People Who Saved a City''. New York: Bloomsbury Press, 2012.</ref>

=== Late 19th century ===
The 1890 election was strongly contested, resulting in white opponents of the [[D. P. Hadden]] faction working to deprive them of votes by [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchising blacks]]. The state had enacted several laws, including the requirement of [[poll taxes]], that made it more difficult for them to register to vote and served to [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchise]] many blacks. Although political party factions in the future sometimes paid [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] to enable blacks to vote, African Americans lost their last positions on the city council in this election and were forced out of the police force. (They did not recover the ability to exercise the franchise until after the passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.) Historian L. B. Wrenn suggests the heightened political hostility of the Democratic contest and related social tensions contributed to a white mob [[Peoples Grocery|lynching three black grocers in Memphis in 1892]].<ref name="wrenn">{{cite book |author = Wrenn, Lynette Boney |year = 1998 |page = given in superscript |title = Crisis and Commission Government in Memphis: Elite Rule in a Gilded Age City |location = Knoxville, Tennessee, USA |publisher = University of Tennessee Press |isbn = 978-0-87049-997-5 |url = https://archive.org/details/crisiscommission0000wren |url-access = registration |access-date = December 2, 2015}}</ref>{{rp|124,131}}

Journalist [[Ida B. Wells]] of Memphis investigated the lynchings, as one of the men killed was a friend of hers. She demonstrated that these and other lynchings were more often due to economic and social competition than any criminal offenses by black men. Her findings were considered so controversial and aroused so much anger that she was forced to move away from the city. But she continued to investigate and publish the abuses of [[Lynching in the United States|lynching]].<ref name="wrenn" />{{rp|131}}

Businessmen were eager to increase the city population after the losses of 1878–79, and supported the annexation of new areas; this measure was passed in 1890 before the census. The annexation measure was finally approved by the state legislature through a compromise achieved with real estate magnates, and the area annexed was slightly smaller than first proposed.<ref name="wrenn" />{{rp|126}}

In 1893 the city was rechartered with [[home rule]], which restored its ability to enact taxes. The state legislature established a cap rate.<ref>Adams, James Truslow and Ketz, Louise Bilebof. ''Dictionary of American History'', New York: Scribner, 1976, p. 302.</ref> Although the commission government was retained and enlarged to five commissioners, Democratic politicians regained control from the business elite. The commission form of government was believed effective in getting things done, but because all positions were elected [[at-large]], requiring them to gain majority votes, this practice reduced representation by candidates representing significant minority political interests.<ref name="wrenn" />{{rp|126f}}

In terms of its economy, Memphis developed as the world's largest [[spot market|spot]] cotton market and the world's largest hardwood lumber market, both commodity products of the Mississippi Delta. Into the 1950s, it was also the world's largest [[mule]] market.

Racist violence continued into the 20th century, with four lynchings between 1900 and the [[lynching of Thomas Williams]] in 1928.<ref>{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |title=A Study of Mob Action in the South |first=John R. |last=Steelman | author-link=John R.

A Tennessee Powder Company built an explosives powder plant to make TNT and gunpowder on a 6,000-acre site in [[Millington, Tennessee|Millington]] in 1940. The plant was built to make smokeless gunpowder for the [[British Armed Forces]] during [[World War II]]. In May 1941, [[DuPont (1802–2017)]] took over the plant, changed the name to the Chickasaw Ordnance Works, and produced powder for the [[United States Armed Forces]]. There were 8,000 employees. The plant was dismantled after the war in 1946.<ref>[https://memphismagazine.com/the-powder-plant/] The Powder Plant |  Memphis, The City Magazine | December 2013</ref><ref>[https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/chickasaw-ordnance-works/] Chickasaw Ordnance Works</ref>

From the 1910s to the 1950s, Memphis was a place of [[machine politics]] under the direction of [[E. H. Crump|E. H. "Boss" Crump]]. He gained a state law in 1911 to establish a small commission to manage the city. The city retained a form of commission government until 1967 and patronage flourished under Crump. Per the publisher's summary of L.B. Wrenn's study of the period, "This centralization of political power in a small commission aided the efficient transaction of municipal business, but the public policies that resulted from it tended to benefit upper-class Memphians while neglecting the less affluent residents and neighborhoods."<ref name="wrenn" />{{page needed|date=December 2015}}<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/crisiscommission0000wren |title=Crisis and Commission Government in Memphis |author=Lynette Boney Wrenn |isbn=978-0-87049-997-5 |access-date=November 15, 2016 |year=1998 |publisher=University of Tennessee Press |url-access=registration }}</ref> The city installed a revolutionary sewer system and upgraded sanitation and drainage to prevent another epidemic. Pure water from an artesian well was discovered in the 1880s, securing the city's water supply. The commissioners developed an extensive network of parks and public works as part of the national [[City Beautiful movement]], but did not encourage heavy industry, which might have provided substantial employment for the working-class population. The lack of representation in city government resulted in the poor and minorities being underrepresented. The majority controlled the election of all the [[at-large]] positions.<ref name="wrenn" />{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

Memphis did not become a [[home rule]] city until 1963, although the state legislature had amended the constitution in 1953 to provide home rule for cities and counties. Before that, the city had to get state bills approved in order to change its charter and other policies and programs. Since 1963, it can change the charter by popular approval of the electorate.<ref name="wrenn" />{{rp|194}}

During the 1960s, the city was at the center of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], as its large African-American population had been affected by state segregation practices and [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]] in the early 20th century. African-American residents drew from the civil rights movement to improve their lives. In 1968, the [[Memphis sanitation strike]] began for [[living wage]]s and better working conditions; the workers were overwhelmingly African American. They marched to gain public awareness and support for their plight: the danger of their work, and the struggles to support families with their low pay. Their drive for better pay had been met with resistance by the city government.

[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], known for his leadership in the non-violent movement, came to lend his support to the workers' cause. King stayed at the [[Lorraine Motel]] in the city, and [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|was assassinated]] by [[James Earl Ray]] on April 4, 1968, the day after giving his ''[[I've Been to the Mountaintop]]'' speech at the [[Mason Temple]].

After learning of King's murder, many African Americans in the city rioted, looting and destroying businesses and other facilities, some by arson. The governor ordered Tennessee National Guardsmen into the city within hours, where small, roving bands of rioters continued to be active.<ref name="lentz">{{cite news |last=Lentz |first=Richard |date=April 6, 1968 |title=Dr. King Is Slain By Sniper: Looting, Arson Touched Off By Death |url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/1968/apr/06/dr-king-slain-sniper-looting-arson-touched-death/ |work=Memphis Commercial Appeal |location=Memphis |access-date=February 1, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202124825/http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/1968/apr/06/dr-king-slain-sniper-looting-arson-touched-death/ |archivedate=February 2, 2014}}</ref> Fearing the violence, more of the middle-class began to leave the city for the suburbs.

=== Climate ===
Memphis has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa'', [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]] ''Cf''), with four distinct seasons, and is located in [[Hardiness zone|USDA Plant Hardiness Zone]] 8a in downtown, cooling to 7b for much of the surrounding region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/# |title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map |publisher=Agricultural Research Center, PRISM Climate Group Oregon State University |access-date=February 24, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227032333/http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/ |archive-date=February 27, 2014}}</ref> Winter weather comes alternately from the upper [[Great Plains]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]], which can lead to drastic swings in temperature. Summer weather may come from [[Texas]] (very hot and humid) or the Gulf (hot and very humid). July has a daily average temperature of {{convert|82.8|°F|1}}, with high levels of humidity due to moisture encroaching from the Gulf of Mexico. Afternoon and evening thunderstorms are frequent during summer, but usually brief, lasting no longer than an hour. Early autumn is pleasantly drier and mild, but can be hot until late October. Late autumn is rainy and cooler; precipitation peaks again in November and December. Winters are mild to chilly, with a January daily average temperature of {{convert|42.1|°F|1}}. Snow occurs sporadically in winter, with an average seasonal snowfall of {{convert|2.7|in|cm|1}}. Ice storms and freezing rain pose a greater danger, as they can often pull tree limbs down on power lines and make driving hazardous. Severe thunderstorms can occur at any time of the year though mainly during the spring months. Large hail, strong winds, flooding, and frequent lightning can accompany these storms. Some storms spawn tornadoes.

The [[Memphis Metropolitan Area|Memphis Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA), the [[List of United States metropolitan statistical areas by population|42nd largest]] in the United States, has a 2010 population of 1,316,100 and includes the Tennessee counties of [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby]], [[Tipton County, Tennessee|Tipton]] and [[Fayette County, Tennessee|Fayette]]; as well as the northern [[Mississippi]] counties of [[DeSoto County, Mississippi|DeSoto]], [[Marshall County, Mississippi|Marshall]], [[Tate County, Mississippi|Tate]], and [[Tunica County, Mississippi|Tunica]]; and [[Crittenden County, Arkansas]], all part of the [[Mississippi Delta]].

The total metropolitan area has a higher proportion of whites and a higher per capita income than the population in the city. The 2010 census shows that the Memphis metro area is close to a [[majority-minority]] population:

<blockquote>the white population is 47.9 percent of the eight-county area's 1,316,100 residents. The non-Hispanic white population, a designation frequently used in census reports, was 46.2 percent of the total. The African American percentage was 45.7. For several decades, the Memphis metro area has had the highest percentage of black population among the nation's large metropolitan areas. The area has seemed on a path to become the nation's first metro area of one million or more with a majority black population.<ref name="demo">{{cite web|url=http://www.smartcitymemphis.com/2011/06/memphis-regions-trends-advance/ |first=Jimmie|last= Covington|title=Memphis Region's Demographic Trends/ Advance|website= Smart City Memphis |date= June 9, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Memphis, Tennessee}}

The city's central geographic location has aided its business development. On the Mississippi River and intersected by five major freight railroads and two [[Interstate highways|Interstate Highways]], I-40 and I-55, Memphis is well positioned for commerce in the transportation and shipping industry. Its access by water was key to its initial development, with steamboats plying the Mississippi river. Railroad construction strengthened its connection to other markets to the east and west.

Since the second half of the 20th century, highways and interstates have played major roles as transportation corridors. A third interstate, [[Interstate 69 in Tennessee|I-69]], is under construction, and a fourth, [[Interstate 22|I-22]], has recently been designated from the former High Priority Corridor X. River barges are unloaded onto trucks and trains. The city is home to [[Memphis International Airport]], the world's [[World's busiest airports by cargo traffic|busiest cargo airport]], surpassing [[Hong Kong International Airport]] in 2021. Memphis serves as a primary hub for [[FedEx Express]] shipping.

On the weekend before Thanksgiving, the Memphis International Jazz Festival is held in the South Main Historic Arts District in Downtown Memphis.

Formerly titled the [[W. C. Handy]] Awards, the International Blues Awards are presented by the [[Blues Foundation]] (headquartered in Memphis) for [[blues]] music achievement. Weeklong playing competitions are held, as well as an awards banquet including a night of performance and celebration.

=== Music ===
Memphis is the home of founders and pioneers of various American music genres, including [[Memphis soul]], [[Memphis blues]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[rock n' roll]], [[rockabilly]], [[Memphis rap]], [[gangsta walking|Buck]], [[crunk]], and "sharecropper" [[country music]] (in contrast to the "[[rhinestone]]" country sound historically associated with [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]).

Many musicians, including [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Carl Perkins]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]], [[Otis Redding]], [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Shawn Lane]], [[Al Green]], [[Bobby Whitlock]], [[Rance Allen]], [[Percy Sledge]], [[Solomon Burke]], [[William Bell (singer)|William Bell]], [[Sam & Dave]] and [[B.B. King]], got their start in Memphis in the 1950s and 1960s.

[[Beale Street]] is a national historical landmark, and shows the impact Memphis has had on American [[blues]], particularly after World War II as electric guitars took precedence over the original acoustic sound from the [[Mississippi Delta]]. [[Sam Phillips]]' [[Sun Studio]] still stands, and is open for tours. Elvis, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and Roy Orbison all made their first recordings there, and were "discovered" by Phillips. Many great blues artists recorded there, such as [[W. C. Handy]], the "Father of the Blues."

[[Stax Records]] created a classic 1960s [[soul music]] sound, much grittier and horn-based than the better-known [[Motown]] from [[Detroit]]. Booker T. and the M.G.s were the label's backing band for most of the classic hits that came from Stax, by Sam & Dave, [[Otis Redding]], [[Wilson Pickett]] and many more. The sound was revisited in the 1980s in the [[The Blues Brothers (film)|''Blues Brothers'' movie]], in which many of the musicians starred as themselves.

Memphis is also noted for its influence on the [[power pop]] musical genre in the 1970s. Notable bands and musicians include [[Big Star]], [[Chris Bell (American musician)|Chris Bell]], [[Alex Chilton]], [[Tommy Hoehn]], [[The Scruffs]] and [[Prix]].<ref name="flyer">{{cite news |first=J.D. |last=Reager |title=''Kill!

Several notable singers are from the Memphis area, including [[Justin Timberlake]], [[K. Michelle]], [[Kirk Whalum]], [[Ruth Welting]], [[Kid Memphis]], [[Kallen Esperian]], [[Julien Baker]] and [[Andrew VanWyngarden]].

Metropolitan Opera performances are now broadcast in HD at local movie theaters across the country.

=== Cuisine ===
Memphis is home to [[Memphis-style barbecue]], which is one of four predominant regional styles of barbecue in the United States.

=== Visual art ===
In addition to the [[Memphis Brooks Museum of Art|Brooks Museum]] and [[Dixon Gallery and Gardens]], Memphis plays host to two burgeoning visual art areas, one city-sanctioned, and the other organically formed.

The South Main Arts District is an arts neighborhood in south downtown. Over the past 20 years, the area has morphed from a derelict brothel and [[juke joint]] neighborhood to a [[gentrification|gentrified]], well-lit area sponsoring "Trolley Night", when arts patrons stroll down the street to see fire spinners, DJs playing in front of clubs, specialty shops and galleries.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jacobson |first=Kelsey |url=http://www.wmcactionnews5.com/story/33410509/boutique-hotel-restaurant-slated-for-south-main |title=Boutique hotel, restaurant slated for South Main – WMC Action News 5 – Memphis, Tennessee |date=October 18, 2016 |publisher=WMC Action News 5 |access-date=July 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arts.gov/exploring-our-town/south-main-artspace-lofts |title=South Main Artspace Lofts &#124; Exploring Our Town |website=Arts.gov |date=December 13, 2011 |access-date=July 13, 2017}}</ref> Not far from South Main Arts district is [[Medicine Factory]], an artist-run organization.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rozzell |first=Jessalyn |title=The Medicine Factory - Downtown Memphis art studios, event space & gallery |url=https://www.medicinefactory.org/ |access-date=November 6, 2022 |website=Medicine Factory |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Literature ===

== Politics ==
{{Main|Government of Memphis, Tennessee}}
{{See also|List of mayors of Memphis, Tennessee}}
Beginning in 1963, Memphis adopted a mayor-council form of government, with 13 [[Memphis City Council|City Council]] members, six elected [[at-large]] from throughout the city and seven elected from geographic districts. Following passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], civil rights activists challenged the at-large electoral system in court because it made it more difficult for the minority to elect candidates of their choice; at-large voting favored candidates who could command a majority across the city. In 1995, the city adopted a new plan. The 13 Council positions are elected from nine geographic districts: seven are single-member districts and two elect three members each.

[[Paul Young (Tennessee politician)|Paul Young]], a Democrat, is the city's mayor. He took office on January 1, 2024.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=Jackson |title=Watch Live as Paul Young gets sworn in as Memphis' next Mayor |url=https://www.localmemphis.com/article/news/politics/watch-live-paul-young-swearing-in-memphis-mayor/522-6d33d25b-617d-45fb-97eb-fdc734f0bbb1 |work=ABC24 |date=January 1, 2024}}</ref>

Since the late 20th century, regional discussions have recurred on the concept of consolidating unincorporated [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] and Memphis into a [[metropolitan government]], as Nashville-Davidson County did in 1963. Consolidation was a referendum item on the 2010 ballots in both the city of Memphis and Shelby County, under the state law for dual-voting on such measures. The referendum was controversial in both jurisdictions. Black leaders, including then-Shelby County Commissioner [[Joe Ford (politician)|Joe Ford]] and national civil rights leader [[Al Sharpton]], opposed the consolidation. According to the plaintiffs' expert, Marcus Pohlmann, these leaders "tried to turn that referendum into a civil rights issue, suggesting that for blacks to vote for consolidation was to give up hard-won civil rights victories of the past".<ref name="consvote" />

In October 2010 before the vote, eight Shelby County citizens had filed a lawsuit in federal court against the state and the Shelby County Elections Commission against the dual-voting requirement. Plaintiffs argued that total votes for the referendum should have been counted together, rather than as separate elections. City voters narrowly supported the measure for consolidation with 50.8% in favor; county voters overwhelmingly voted against the measure with 85% against.<ref name="dismiss">[http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/local-news/appellate-court-dismisses-challenge-of-dual-vote-requirement-for-consolidated-government_82638081 Clay Bailey, "Appellate court dismisses challenge of dual vote requirement for consolidated government"], ''Commercial Appeal'', December 31, 2014, accessed February 21, 2015</ref> The state argued that with the election decided, the lawsuit should be dismissed, but the federal court disagreed.<ref name="consvote">[http://www.memphisdailynews.com/news/2014/jan/6/consolidation-voting-case-still-complex-in-3rd-year/ Bill Dries, "Consolidation Voting Case Still Complex in 3rd Year"], ''Memphis Daily News'', January 6, 2014, accessed February 21, 2015</ref>

By late 2013, in pre-trial actions, both sides were trying to disqualify the other's experts, in discussions of whether regional voting revealed racial polarization, and whether voting on the referendum demonstrated racial bloc voting. "The experts for both sides have clashed on whether racial bloc voting is inevitable in local elections and whether that would require some kind of court remedy."<ref name="consvote" />

The defendants' expert, Todd Donovan, did not think that polarized voting as revealed for political candidates meant that "African-American voters and white voters have polarized interests when it comes to referendum choices on government administration, taxation, service provision and other policy questions."<ref name="consvote" /> He noted, "In the absence of distinct political interests that create polarized blocs of referendum voters defined by race, there is no cohesive racial minority voting interest that can be diluted by a referendum."<ref name="consvote" />

In 2014, the federal district court dismissed the lawsuit, on the grounds that the referendum would have failed when both jurisdictions' votes were counted together. (In total voting, 64% of voters opposed the consolidation.) In the last week of December 2014, the U.S. Sixth District Court of Appeals upheld that decision, ruling that, ""In this election, the referendum for consolidation did not pass and would not have passed even if there had been no dual-majority vote requirement (with the vote counts combined)."<ref name="dismiss" />

Before the referendum, the decision was made by the city and county to exclude public school management and operations from the proposed consolidation. As noted below, in 2011 the Memphis city council voted to dissolve its city school board and consolidate with the Shelby County School System, without the collaboration or agreement of Shelby County.<ref name="school">[http://columbialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/47_Anderson.pdf "MAKING A REGIONAL DISTRICT: MEMPHIS CITY SCHOOLS DISSOLVES INTO ITS SUBURBS"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221194549/http://columbialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/47_Anderson.pdf |date=February 21, 2015 }}, ''Columbia Law Review'', March 2012</ref> The city had authority for this action under Tennessee state laws that differentiate between city and county powers.

Interstate 22 connects Memphis with [[Birmingham, Alabama]], via northern Mississippi (including [[Tupelo, Mississippi|Tupelo]]) and northwestern Alabama. While technically not entering the city of Memphis proper, I-22 ends at I-269 in [[Byhalia, Mississippi]], connecting it to the rest of the Memphis interstate system.

Interstate 69 is proposed to follow I-55 and I-240 through the city of Memphis. Once completed, I-69 will link Memphis with [[Port Huron, Michigan]] via [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], and [[Brownsville, Texas]] via [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] and [[Houston, Texas]].<ref name=tdottimeline />

A new spur, [[Interstate 555]], also serves the Memphis metro area connecting it to [[Jonesboro, Arkansas]].

Other important federal highways though Memphis include the east–west [[U.S. Route 70 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 70]], [[U.S. Route 64 (Tennessee)|U.S. Route 64]], and [[U.S. Route 72 (Tennessee)|U.S. Route 72]]; and the north–south [[U.S. Route 51 (Tennessee)|U.S. Route 51]] and [[U.S. Route 61 (Tennessee)|U.S. Route 61]].<ref name=tdotmap /> The former is the historic highway north to Chicago via [[Cairo, Illinois]], while the latter roughly parallels the Mississippi River for most of its course and crosses the [[Mississippi Delta]] region to the south, with the Delta also legendary for Blues music.

'''Roadways'''

Memphis maintains 6,800 lane-miles of city roadways. The city collaborated with [[Google Cloud Platform]] and SpringML in February 2019 to test [[machine learning]] (ML) to improve public services. A key focus is pothole identification using [[TensorFlow]] technology.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Baolin Liu|first=SpringML|date=February 2019|title=Partnership with City of Memphis to Improve City Services|url=https://www.springml.com/blog/partnership-with-city-of-memphis-to-improve-city-services/|website=SpringML.com}}</ref> Public Works personnel completed 63,000 repairs, with around 7,500 of those reported by citizens to 311.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Rodriguez|first=Michael|date=April 25, 2019|title=Machine Learning for Improved Services: Potholes|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/machine-learning-improved-services-potholes-michael-rodriguez/|website=LinkedIn.com}}</ref>

==== Transit ====
The [[Memphis Area Transit Authority]] provides local transit services around Memphis, including the [[MATA Trolley]] heritage streetcar system. Intercity bus service to the city is provided by [[Flixbus]], [[Greyhound Lines]], and [[Jefferson Lines]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jeffersonlines.com/bus-stops/tennessee/|title=Jefferson Lines Tennessee Bus Stops|access-date=July 20, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.greyhound.com/bus-routes|title=Greyhound Bus Routes|access-date=July 20, 2023}}</ref>

==== Railroads ====
[[File:Memphis Arkansas Bridge Memphis TN 2012-07-22 016.jpg|thumb|Three bridges over the Mississippi]]
A large volume of railroad freight moves through Memphis, because of its two heavy-duty Mississippi River railroad crossings, which carry several major east–west railroad freight lines, and also because of the major north–south railroad lines through Memphis which connect with such major cities as Chicago, [[St. Louis]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[New Orleans]], [[Dallas]], [[Houston]], [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], and [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]].

By the early 20th century, Memphis had two major passenger railroad stations, which made the city a regional hub for trains coming from the north, east, south and west. After passenger railroad service declined heavily through the middle of the 20th century, the [[Memphis Union Station]] was demolished in 1969. The [[Central Station (Memphis)|Memphis Central Station]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbu.edu/~mcondren/MRP/MemphisCentralStation/MemphisCentralStation.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926014426/http://www.cbu.edu/~mcondren/MRP/MemphisCentralStation/MemphisCentralStation.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 26, 2015 |title=Christian Brothers University |access-date=July 13, 2017}}</ref> was eventually renovated, and it still serves the city. The only inter-city passenger railroad service to Memphis is the daily ''[[City of New Orleans (train)|City of New Orleans]]'' train, operated by [[Amtrak]], which has one train northbound and one train southbound each day between Chicago and New Orleans.

==== River port ====
{{Main|Port of Memphis}}
Memphis has the second-busiest cargo port on the Mississippi River, which is also the fourth-busiest inland port in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/ndc/wcsc/pdf/inlandport03f.pdf |title=Top US Inland Ports for 2003 |access-date=July 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825064009/http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/ndc/wcsc/pdf/inlandport03f.pdf |archive-date=August 25, 2009}}</ref> The International Port of Memphis covers both the Tennessee and Arkansas sides of the Mississippi River from [[river mile]]&nbsp;725 (km&nbsp;1167) to mile&nbsp;740 (km&nbsp;1191).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portofmemphis.com/about.asp |title=Port of Memphis website – About Page |publisher=Portofmemphis.com |access-date=July 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307052924/http://www.portofmemphis.com/about.asp |archive-date=March 7, 2010}}</ref> A focal point of the river port is the [[industrial park]] on [[President's Island]], just south of [[Downtown Memphis, Tennessee|Downtown Memphis]].

==== Bridges ====
Four railroad and highway bridges cross the Mississippi River at Memphis. In order of their opening years, these are the [[Frisco Bridge]] (1892, [[single track (rail)|single-track]] rail), the [[Harahan Bridge]] (1916, a [[road-rail bridge]] until 1949, currently carries [[double-track]] rail), the [[Memphis-Arkansas Memorial Bridge]] (Highway, 1949; later incorporated into [[Interstate 55]]), and the [[Hernando de Soto Bridge]] ([[Interstate 40]], 1973). A bicycle/pedestrian walkway opened along the Harahan Bridge in late 2016, utilizing the former westbound roadway.<ref>{{cite web|last=Charlier |first=Tom |url=http://archive.commercialappeal.com/news/historic-frisco-bridge-getting-extensive-makeover-by-bnsf-34daa9f1-937e-6562-e053-0100007fe70b-382568411.html |title=Historic Frisco Bridge getting extensive makeover by BNSF |website=Archive.commercialappeal.com |date=June 11, 2016 |access-date=July 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/2016/10/21/monumental-impact-seen-crossing/92465774/ |title=Big River Crossing opens Saturday |website=Commercialappeal.com |access-date=July 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://bikepedmemphis.wordpress.com/2016/10/22/the-harahan-bridge-opens/ |title=The Harahan Bridge Opens – Bike/Ped Memphis |website=Bikepedmemphis.wordpress.com |date=October 22, 2016 |access-date=July 13, 2017}}</ref>

=== Utilities ===
Memphis's primary utility provider is the [[Memphis Light, Gas and Water]] Division (MLGW). This is the largest three-service municipal utility in the United States, providing electricity, natural gas, and pure water service to all residents of Shelby County. Prior to that, Memphis was served by two primary electric companies, which were merged into the Memphis Power Company.<ref name="MLGWhistory">{{cite web |title=A History of Performance |publisher=Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division |url=http://www.mlgw.com/about/history |access-date=July 30, 2012}}</ref>

The City of Memphis bought the private company in 1939 to form MLGW,<ref name="MLGWhistory" /><ref>{{cite court |litigants=Re Memphis Power & Light Co. & Tennessee Valley Authority |vol=1 |reporter=F.P.C. |opinion=809 |court=[[Federal Power Commission|FPC]] |year=1939 |url=}}</ref> which was an early customer of electricity from the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA). In 1954 the [[Dixon-Yates contract]] was proposed to make more power available to the city from the TVA, but the contract was cancelled; it had been an issue for the Democrats in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1954|1954 Congressional elections]].
