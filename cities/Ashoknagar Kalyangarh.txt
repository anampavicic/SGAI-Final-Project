Ashoknagar has a heritage of political activism, high-quality education, and culture. Ashoknagar Kalyangarh was planned by Dr. B.C Roy and was later named after the leader [[Ashoke Kumar Sen]] {{citation needed|date=September 2022}}. The Congressional leaders Tarun Kanti Ghosh and Keshab Bhattacharjee and the CPI leaders Dr. Sadhan Sen, Bikash Ray Chaudhuri, Nani Kar and Chitta Ranjan Basu were principal architects of Ashoknagar Kalyangarh.

The first social & cultural organisations Janayug Sangskritik Sangstha played a vital role to build a cultural environment in the 70s decade . CPI(ML) Organizer Atmajit Chowdhury, Dramatist Swadesh Munshi, Social Worker Parlay Ghosh, Trapada Bhattacharjee, Gauranga Kar, Biswajit Das were contributed notable works in town's cultural development.

The first unit in this district of West Bengal State Government Employees Pensioners' Samity was formed in Ashokenagar under the leadership of J.C Kundu which worked towards the safeguarding of the rights of retired employees of the state government.

The area has two parks, Sanghati Park and Millennium Science Park. There are four English medium schools in Ashoknagar. The area is connected to Kolkata through rail(Bongaon-Sealdah) and road (Jessore Road/NH112/AH1) networks.

Here was the Kalyani Spinning Mill which is now converted into a Textile Park. The city previously had a unit of RIC and a chemical factory; both were closed down by the state government.

==History==
Under British rule, During the period of [[World War II]], Ashoknagar Kalyanagarh was site of a British Royal Air Force Airbase. The site that became Ashoknagar Kalyanagarh was a RAF airfield known by the name of Baigachi Airfield. Four RAF hangars still stand, the remnants of a bygone era. After World War II, the airfield and hangars went into disuse. After India became independent, Dr. [[Bidhan Chandra Roy]], the then CM of West Bengal, developed the airfield into a planned city. The site was initially known as "Habra Urban Colony". Later, its north-east portion was named "Kalyangarh" and then its south-west portion was named "Ashoknagar".
