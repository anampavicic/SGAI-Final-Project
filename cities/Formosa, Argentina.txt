'''Formosa''' ({{IPA|es|foɾˈmosa}}) is the capital city of the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Formosa Province|Formosa]], on the banks of the [[Paraguay River]], opposite the Paraguayan town of [[Alberdi, Paraguay|Alberdi]], about {{convert|1200|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north from [[Buenos Aires]], on [[National Route A011 (Argentina)|National Route 11]]. The city has a population of about 234,000 per the {{census-ar|2010}}.

Formosa is the hub of the provincial industry, that processes the product of its natural resources. The port that serves Paraguay towards the [[Paraná River]] is the main transport means for the provincial production.

Notable sights of the city include the ''Nuestra Señora del Carmen'' Cathedral, the Government House, the ''Torelli'' Botanic Forest Garden, the Provincial History Museum (''Museo Histórico Provincial''), the ''Estadio Centenario'' ("Centenary Stadium") [[football (soccer)|football]] stadium, the ''Guaicole'' fauna reserve,  the shore of the [[Paraguay River]], the ''Isla de Oro'' Island, and the Central Square named after [[José de San Martín]].

== History ==
The lands were initially inhabited by the [[Toba (tribe)|Toba]] and [[Wichí]] (Mataco) indigenous peoples. On April 8, 1879 Commander [[Luis Jorge Fontana]] founded the settlement that would become the capital of the National Territory of Chaco from 1884 to June 15, 1955, when it gained the status of province. The Formosa campus of the [[National University of the Northeast]] was established as the [[National University of Formosa]] in 1988.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.unf.edu.ar/historia/|title= Historia|trans-title= History|language= Spanish|author= |date= |publisher= Universidad Nacional de Formosa|accessdate=June 18, 2024}}</ref>

The name of the city (and the province) comes from the archaic [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''fermosa'' (currently ''hermosa'') meaning "beautiful". The name ''Vuelta Fermosa'' or ''Vuelta la Formosa'' was used by Spanish sailors in the 16th century to describe the area where the [[Paraguay River]] makes a turn, right in front of the actual city. These sailors were searching for the legendary [[Sierra de la Plata]].<ref>[http://www.argentinaturistica.com/foriresenia.htm Reseña] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528065603/http://www.argentinaturistica.com/foriresenia.htm |date=2007-05-28 }} (Spanish)</ref>

== Government and politics ==
The city of Formosa is governed by the Municipal Council, which has autonomous status. It consists of an Executive Department (led by the Mayor), a Legislative Department (the Deliberative Council), and a Judicial Department (headed by the Municipal Chamber of Appeals and the misdemeanor judges distributed in the two Misdemeanor Courts of the city).

The Deliberative Council of Formosa has the highest number of members in the entire province, as it is the only municipality that currently has over 100,000 inhabitants in the province. There are a total of twelve councilors. The Council is headed by the President of the Council, followed by the 1st Vice President and the 2nd Vice President of the Council.

The Executive Department is led by the Mayor of the city of Formosa, who determines the members of the municipal cabinet. Within the cabinet, the Secretaries are responsible for endorsing the acts of the Mayor within their competence. Each Municipal Secretary is in charge of a specific area of the Executive Department. These secretaries, in turn, have sub-secretariats under their authority, which handle more specific competencies. Generally, the Sub-secretariats, such as the Traffic and Transportation sub-secretariat, are further divided into General Directorates, which are composed of Directorates and Departments.

== Culture ==
The city, which is only a few hundred meters away from Paraguay across the river, has a culture closer to that of Paraguay than the "[[porteño]]" culture of Buenos Aires.  Laid back and relaxed, its young people relax on the Costanera, the recently restored pathway along the Río Paraguay which serves as a venue for arts displays and features a fast-food restaurant, or at boliches, local clubs. The city's well-known cultural institutions include the Formosa Regional Historical Museum, the Juan Pablo Duffard Historical Museum (a [[List of National Historic Monuments of Argentina|National Historic Monument]]), the Qomp [[Toba (tribe)|Toba]] Artisanal Museum, and the Oscar Albertazzi Arts Institute.

The city has, since the 1970s, enjoyed increasing domestic tourism as a winter destination and, since the devaluation of the [[Historical exchange rates of Argentine currency|peso]] in 2002, growing international tourism, as well. Formosa is currently home to one five-star hotel (the International Tourist Hotel) and four four-star hotels. One other five-star establishment, the Howard Johnson Neo Formosa, was completed in July 2011 and features a casino and shopping gallery. 23,000-capacity Estadio Don Carlos Antonio Romero, used mainly for association football, is the main venue in Formosa.

=== Festivals ===

Formosa celebrates Our Lady of Carmen (''Nuestra Señora del Carmen''), its [[patron saint]], on July 16 in honor of its holy day.  Celebrations, which occur in the main Plaza San Martín, include the traditional pericón dance and stalls selling everything from food to balloons.

It also celebrates the Fiesta del Río in November, Carnaval on weekends in February and Día de la Fundación de Formosa in April.

==Transport==
[[File:LanchaRioParaguayFsa.JPG|thumb|center|River transport between Formosa and Alberdi, Paraguay.]]

Located in the [[Argentine Littoral]], Formosa is well connected to the rest of the country, the most used ways to go to and from Formosa, are through:

*The '''Formosa Bus Terminal Station''', which goes to medium and long distances, with great passenger movement throughout the year. Several national and international transport companies operate in the city, whose most common destinations are [[Buenos Aires]], [[Rosario]], [[Corrientes]], [[Resistencia, Chaco|Resistencia]], [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], [[Posadas, Misiones|Posadas]], [[Salta]] and [[Clorinda, Formosa|Clorinda]]-[[Asunción]].
*The '''[[El Pucú Airport]]''' {{airport codes|FMA|SARF}}, 7 kilometres south of the city , serves charter flights, and regular flights to Buenos Aires.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://centreforaviation.com/data/profiles/airports/formosa-el-pucu-airport-fma|title=Formosa El Pucú Airport Profile|website=Centreforaviation.com|access-date=October 25, 2020}}</ref>
*The '''Port of Formosa''', with boat services to and from [[Alberdi, Paraguay|Alberdi]], [[Paraguay]].

The '''[[General Belgrano Railway]]''', which is currently not in operation. In the branch near the port, its tracks were dismantled and the building where the station was located was converted into a museum, while the sheds of its mechanical workshops were converted into a large fair.

*The '''Public and Semi-public Transportation of Passengers''': the city of Formosa has modern transportation units, reaching international standards, also providing the user with air conditioning and wifi while traveling; There are also taxi and remiss agencies.

From Buenos Aires, the highways to take are the: [[National Route A011 (Argentina)|National Route A011]], National Route 86 and [[National Route 12 (Argentina)|National Route 12]].

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
[[File:ParaisodeLosNiñosLapacho.jpg|thumb|[[Tabebuia|Lapachos]] in bloom at the Children's Paradise Park]] 
The city has a climate considered as [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] or ''Cfa'' by [[Köppen classification]]. The city's climate is among the hottest and most humid in Argentina: Winters are generally mild, [[frost|air frosts]] are very uncommon. Summers are hot and humid. During the most extreme [[heat waves]], temperatures exceed {{convert|40|°C|°F|disp=or}}. Temperatures have exceeded {{convert|35|°C|°F}} in every [[season]].<ref name=SNM>{{cite web |url =http://www.smn.gov.ar/?mod=clima&id=30&provincia=Formosa&ciudad=Formosa |title = Datos Estadísticos (Período 1981-1990) | access-date = August 23, 2012 | language = es}}</ref>

Summers are long, hot and sticky, with most days between {{convert|30|and|35|°C|°F}}; temperatures up to {{convert|38|°C|°F|1}} are common, and nights are usually between {{convert|20|and|25|°C|°F|disp=or}}. Cooler temperatures only arrive by late April, and winters are warm: highs average {{convert|22|°C|°F|1|disp=or}}, lows average {{convert|12|°C|°F|disp=or}}. However, these averages are reached through a pattern that switches from hot, northerly winds, to cold southerly winds, and so forth: with northerly winds, temperatures are often much hotter, between {{convert|25|and|30|°C|°F}} and nights are mild, around {{convert|15|°C|°F|disp=or}}. Southerly winds often bring a period of drizzly, cold weather with temperatures that stay around {{convert|10|to|15|°C|°F}} for a day or two (which, combined with the high humidity and the winds can feel surprisingly cold), followed by clear skies, cold nights ({{convert|2|to|7|°C|°F|disp=or}}) and pleasant days at {{convert|15|to|20|°C|°F}}. Light frost is possible in Formosa, especially in the outskirts of the city further away from the river; however, air temperatures seldom fall below {{convert|0|°C|°F|disp=or}}, every few years at most, with a record low of {{convert|&minus;2|°C|°F|1|disp=or}}. The highest temperature recorded was {{convert|43.7|°C|1|disp=or}} on October 17, 2014 while the lowest temperature recorded was {{convert|-2.5|°C|1|disp=or}} on July 29, 2021.<ref name=SMN3/>

Rainfall can be expected throughout the year though summer is usually the wettest season. [[Thunderstorms]] can be intense with frequent [[lightning]], powerful gusts of wind and intense [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}
