'''Srinagar''' (English: {{IPAc-en|audio=Srinagar.ogg|ˈ|s|r|iː|n|ə|g|ər}}; {{IPA|ks|siriːnagar}}) is a city in Indian-administered [[Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Jammu and Kashmir]] in the [[Kashmir|disputed Kashmir]] region.<ref name=tertiary-kashmir>The application of the term "administered" to the various regions of [[Kashmir]] and a mention of the Kashmir dispute is supported by the [[WP:TERTIARY|tertiary sources]] (a) through (d), reflecting [[WP:DUE|due weight]] in the coverage. Although "controlled" and "held" are also applied neutrally to the names of the disputants or to the regions administered by them, as evidenced in sources (f) through (h) below, "held" is also considered politicised usage, as is the term "occupied," (see (i) below). <br />

The city is known for its natural environment, various gardens, waterfronts and [[houseboat]]s. It is also known for traditional Kashmiri handicrafts like the [[Kashmir shawl]] (made of [[Pashmina (material)|pashmina]] and [[cashmere wool]]), papier-mâché, wood carving, carpet weaving, and jewel making, as well as for [[dried fruit]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/photo/dal-lake-srinagar-cold-winter-frozen-kashmir-chillai-kalan-travel-lifest-1123112-2018-01-05|title=Here's how beautiful Srinagar's Dal Lake looks this winter|date=5 January 2018|website=India Today|access-date=30 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180130122935/https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/photo/dal-lake-srinagar-cold-winter-frozen-kashmir-chillai-kalan-travel-lifest-1123112-2018-01-05|archive-date=30 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://srinagar.nic.in/|title=District Srinagar :: Official Website|website=srinagar.nic.in|access-date=30 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204230258/http://srinagar.nic.in/|archive-date=4 February 2006|url-status=live}}</ref> It is the second-largest metropolitan area in the [[Himalayas]] (after [[Kathmandu]], the capital of Nepal).

Founded in the 6th century during the rule of the [[Gonanda dynasty]] according to the [[Rajatarangini]], the city took on the name of an earlier capital thought to have been founded by the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryas]] in its vicinity. The city remained the most important capital of the Kashmir Valley under the Hindu dynasties, and was a major centre of learning. During the 14th–16th centuries the city's old town saw major expansions, particularly under the [[Shah Mir dynasty]], whose kings used various parts of it as their capitals. It became the spiritual centre of Kashmir, and attracted several [[Sufism|Sufi]] preachers. It also started to emerge as a hub of [[shawl]] weaving and other Kashmiri handicrafts. In the late 16th century, the city became part of the [[Mughal Empire]], many of whose emperors used it as their summer resort. Many Mughal gardens were built in the city and around Dal lake during this time, of which [[Shalimar Bagh, Srinagar|Shalimar]] and [[Nishat Bagh|Nishat]] are the most well-known.

After passing through the hands of the Afghan [[Durrani Empire|Durranis]] and the [[Sikh Empire|Sikhs]] in the late 18th and early 19th century, it eventually became the summer capital of the [[Dogra dynasty|Dogra]] kingdom of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] in 1846. The city became a popular tourist destination among Europeans and Indian elites during this time, with several hotels and its iconic houseboats being built. In 1952, the city became the summer capital of [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]], a region administered by India as a state, with [[Jammu]] being its winter capital. It was the flashpoint of violence during the 1990s and early 2000s [[Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir|insurgency]] in the region. In 2019, it became the summer capital of a smaller region which is administered by India as a union territory, after the former state's [[Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019|reorganisation]].

==History==
[[File:Ladakh1981-134.jpg|thumb|upright|left|An 8th century Hindu temple at Pandrethan, in the vicinity of present-day Srinagar]]

===Early history===
According to the [[Rajatarangini]] of [[Kalhana]], a capital city by the name of ''Srinagari'' was built in the Kashmir valley by [[Ashoka (Gonandiya)|Ashoka]].{{efn|Despite several discrepancies, scholars identify this Ashoka of the Rajatarangini with the [[Mauryan empire|Mauryan]] emperor [[Ashoka]].{{sfn|Wani|Wani|2023|p=75}}{{sfn|Kaul|2018|p=110}}}} Kalhana calls this capital ''puranadhisthana'', Sanskrit for 'old capital', identified as present-day Pandrethan, 3.5 kilometres south-east of Srinagar.{{sfn|Wani|Wani|2023|p=75}} A 'new capital' was built by king [[Gonanda dynasty#Rule#Pravarasena II|Pravarasena]], called ''Parvarapura'', in 6th century CE. ''Srinagari'' continued to be used as a name for this capital. This new capital was located at the base of the Hari Parbat hill on the right bank of the Jhelum, corresponding to the location of modern-day Srinagar.{{sfn|Hamdani|2021|p=22}} Kalhana describes the capital having several markets, mansions, wooden houses, grand temples and canals, and also refers to the Dal lake and Jhelum river.{{sfn|Khan|1978|p=3–4}} A long embankment was constructed on the Jhelum by Pravarasena to protect the city from floods, parts of which have survived to the present day.{{sfn|Wani|Wani|2023|p=159}} The two capitals are also mentioned in the chronicle of Chinese traveller [[Xuanxang|Huein Tsang]] who visited the city in 631 CE.{{sfn|Khan|1978|p=3}}{{sfn|Rabbani|1981|p=33}} Although several other capitals of Kashmir were constructed by other rulers over the next few centuries, Pravarasena's Srinagar survived as the capital.{{efn|Historian [[Mohammad Ishaq Khan]] states that this is due Srinagar's central location within the valley and the larger neighbourhood, and due to the presence of various water bodies around the city which provided protection.{{sfn|Khan|1978|p=6–7}}}} The city was divided into several parts, each with its own guardian deity, which continue to be worshipped by [[Hindu Kashmiris]].{{sfn|Rabbani|1981|p=33–35}} The 8th century scholar [[Adi Shankara]] visited the city and founded the [[Shankaracharya Temple]] here, at the site of the earlier Jyeshteshwara Temple.{{sfn|Kaul|2018|pp=124–125}} The city gradually extended to the left bank of the Jhelum river, and in the early 12th century the royal palace was shifted to this side.{{sfn|Khan|1978|p=8}}

===Sultanate period===
[[File:Jama Masjid, Srinagar (14363005587).jpg|thumb|left|The Jamia Masjid in Srinagar, built in the beginning of 15th century CE]]
[[Rinchan]]a, a Buddhist convert to Islam who briefly ruled Kashmir in the early 14th century, built the first mosque in Kashmir on the site of a Buddhist temple in a colony of Srinagar built by him.{{sfn|Khan|1978|p=9}} The Muslim rulers that came after him established their capitals in areas of present-day old city Srinagar.{{sfn| Khan|1978|pp=9–10}} During the rule of the Sultans, the city became synonymous with the Kashmir valley, and 'Srinagar' fell into disuse as a name for it.{{efn|The name, however, did not become obsolete and finds mention in several contemporary sources.{{sfn|Khan|1978|p=9}}}}{{sfn|Khan|1978|p=8}} During the rule of Qutbuddin, Islamic preacher [[Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani]] visited the valley and established his seat of preaching in Srinagar. Sultan [[Sikandar Shahmiri]] (1389–1413 CE) built the ''[[Khanqah-e-Moula]]'' at this location, and also built the [[Jamia Masjid, Srinagar|Jamia Mosque]] at Nowhatta in 1402.{{sfn|Hamdani|2021|p=83}} The oldest surviving example of forcible conversion of a Hindu place of worship into Muslim shrine in Kashmir also appears from Srinagar under Sikandar's rule.{{sfn|Hamdani2021|pp=99–100}} Sikandar's successor [[Zayn al-Abidin (sultan of Kashmir)|Zain-ul-Abidin]] undertook several constructions in and around Srinagar. He built the ''[[Zaina Kadal|Zainakadal]]'' bridge connecting the two halves of the city on either side of the Jhelum river, the [[Nallah Mar|Mar canal]] and two islands inside Dal lake called Sona Lank and Rupa Lank.{{sfn|Khan|1978|p=10}} He also built a stone shrine for his Islamic teacher at [[Madin Sahib]], and a brick mausoleum for his mother constructed using materials from a Hindu structure and showing Timurid influences,{{sfn|Hamdani|2021|p=65–66}} where he was also buried after his death.

[[File:India - Srinagar - 023 - Nishat Bagh Mughal Gardens.jpg|thumb|[[Nishat Bagh]], a Mughal Garden built during the reign of [[Shah Jahan]] on the northern bank of the Dal lake, in the vicinity of Srinagar]]
The [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] annexed Kashmir in 1586 after a period of internal instability in the valley, and added it to their Kabul province. Mughal emperor [[Akbar]] visited the valley three times. During his second visit in 1592, an elaborate [[Diwali]] celebration was held in Srinagar.{{sfn|Khan|1978|p=12}} On the final such visit, he was accompanied by the first recorded European visitors to the area.{{efn|These were jesuit priests [[Jerome Xavier]] and [[Bento de Góis]].{{sfn|Khan|1978|p=13}}}} Akbar built fortifications around the Hari Parbat hill, and established a township called ''Nagar Nagar'' there.{{sfn|Khan|1978|p=13}} He also built a shrine for [[Hamza Makhdoom]], a Sufi mystic of Kashmir's [[Rishi order]], on the southern slope of Hari Parbat which was later expanded several times.{{sfn|Hamdani|2021|p=93–95}} His successor [[Jahangir]] was particularly fond of the Kashmir valley and frequently visited it.{{sfn|Khan|1978|p=13}} His rule brought prosperity to Srinagar, and several Mughal gardens were built in the city and around the Dal lake during his and his successor [[Shah Jahan]]'s reign, including the [[Shalimar Bagh, Srinagar|Shalimar]] and [[Nishat Bagh]]. Empress [[Nur Jahan]] built the [[Pathar Mosque]] on the left bank of Jhelum river opposite the ''Khānqāh-e-Moula'' in 1623, the mosque was however deemed unfit for worship soon after its construction and used instead for non-religious purposes.<ref>{{citation|last=Rai |first=Mridu |chapter=To 'Tear the Mask off the Face of the Past': Archaeology and Politics in Jammu and Kashmir |title=Kashmir: History, Politics, Representation |editor=Chitralekha Zutshi |url=https://www.cambridge.org/9781107181977 |year=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-18197-7 |pages=39–41}}</ref> Shah Jahan made Kashmir into a separate ''[[Mughal Kashmir|Subah]]'' (province) with its administrative seat at Srinagar in 1638. The [[Aali Masjid]] was built during the reign of [[Aurangzeb]] (1658–1707), as was the Safa kadal bridge over the Jhelum. The ''moi muqaddas'', a relic believed to be the hair strand of prophet Muhammad's beard, also arrived in Kashmir during this time, and was housed in a Mughal palace at [[Hazratbal]], which became the [[Hazratbal Shrine|Hazratbal Dargah]]. A number of Europeans visited the city during the later Mughal period.{{efn|These include physician [[Francois Bernier]] and priests [[Ippolito Desideri]] and Manoel Freyre.{{sfn|Khan|1978|p=15}}}}

===Afghan and Sikh rule===
In 1753, Kashmir passed into the hands of the Afghan [[Durrani Empire]]. The Afghans undertook reconstructions in Srinagar and built the palace at [[Sher Garhi Palace|Shergarhi]] at the site of a pre-existing ancient palace, as well as the fort atop Hari Parbat.{{sfn|Khan|1978|p=16}} However, contemporary accounts describe the city as filthy and deteriorating, and it also saw worsening inter-community relations during Afghan rule, with repeated Hindu-Muslim and Shia-Sunni riots, and state persecution of Pandits.{{sfn|Hamdani|2021|pages=167–169}} In 1819, the [[Sikh Empire]] assumed control of Kashmir. Under them,  ''Srinagar'', the old name of the city, was restored. The situation in the city did not improve much under Sikh rule, and the city remained in a state of decay.{{sfn|Khan|1978|pp=16–17}} They also imposed several restrictions on Muslim religious expression, and closed the gates of the Jamia Mosque, which remained closed until 1843. A Shia-Sunni riot happened in the city in 1837.{{sfn|Hamdani|2021|pages=167–169}}

===Dogra rule===
[[File:View of Srinagar 1872.jpg|thumb|An 1872 painting depicting the city of Srinagar.]]
With the establishment of [[Dogra dynasty|Dogra rule]] following the 1846 [[Treaty of Amritsar (1846)|Treaty of Amritsar]], Srinagar became the capital of the [[princely state]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]]. Taxes were increased and the production of silk, saffron, paper, tobacco, wine, and salt, as well as the sale of grain, became the monopoly of the state. It was a capital offence for a Muslim to kill a cow as late as the 1920s; later, the penalty was reduced to ten years of imprisonment and still later to seven years (Section 219 of [[Ranbir Penal Code]]).<ref>

</ref> The Dogras found Srinagar deteriorating, filthy and overcrowded.{{sfn|Khan|1978|pp=18–20}} The city used to see several break-outs of [[cholera]], as well as earthquakes, floods, fires and famines. The famine of 1877–79 is said to have halved the city's population.{{sfn|Khan|1978|pp=20–24}} Consequently, due to the famine and forced labour in the villages, a considerable number of people migrated to Srinagar.{{sfn|Khan|1978|pp=32}}

The [[Darbar Move]] was introduced in 1872 by [[Ranbir Singh of Jammu and Kashmir|Ranbir Singh]], whereby the capital moved to [[Jammu]] for six months during the winter<ref>{{citation |last=Zutshi |first=Chitralekha | year=2019 |title=Kashmir |series=Oxford India Short Introductions |publisher=OUP |isbn=978-0-19-012141-9 |pages=53–54}}</ref> albeit later phased down by [[Hari Singh]] who "fixed his headquarters permanently at Jammu". The Ministers and Heads of Departments continued to followed it, nevertheless, it was still a move which was resented by Kashmiris, particularly Pandits.{{sfn|Bazaz|1941|pp=91}} The [[Raghunath Temple, Srinagar|Raghunath Temple]] was also completed during Ranbir Singh's rule.{{sfn|Zutshi|2019|p=54}} With a global decline in shawl trade during late 19th century, the shawl weaving class of the city was upended. Several changes were ushered in during the reign of [[Pratap Singh of Jammu and Kashmir|Pratap Singh]] (1885–1925). A [[Residencies of British India|British Residency]] was established in Srinagar and direct British influence on the administration of the state grew. During this time, Srinagar, and in turn the Kashmir Valley, was connected to the rest of India via roads, which saw increased trade with [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]]. In 1886, a municipality was established for the city of Srinagar.{{sfn|Khan|1978|p=27}} Works for sanitation and urban development undertaken by the municipality were often met with stiff opposition by the residents, who were averse to changes.{{sfn|Khan|1978|p=27–28}} In the late 19th and early 20th century, modern tourism began to take hold in the city, especially on and around the Dal lake, with houseboats being built to accommodate British officers and their families who came in the summers seeking respite from the heat of the [[North Indian River Plain|plains]] of northern India.<ref>{{citation |last=Casimir |first=Michael J. |year=2021 |title=Floating Economies: The Cultural Ecology of the Dal Lake in Kashmir, India |publisher=Berghahn Books |isbn=978-1-80073-029-8 |page=11}}</ref> The Shergarhi Palace was greatly modified by the Dogras, who used it as their official residence in the city. Pratap Singh and his successor [[Hari Singh]] also laid out several parks in the city. The city expanded rapidly between 1891 and 1941, partly due to increased migration from the countryside as a result of famines and due to improvements in sanitation and urban development as well as economic expansion, in particular the growth of the textile and tourism industries in the city.{{sfn|Khan|1978|pp=32–33}} Many [[Punjabis]] also settled in Srinagar during this time for trade, commerce and administration.{{sfn|Khan|1978|pp=39–40}}{{sfn|Zutshi|2019|p=55}}

Srinagar emerged as the hub of political activity within the Kashmir valley during later Dogra rule. Kashmiris at large despised the Dogra rule and considered the dynasty an "alien rule".{{sfn|Bazaz|1941|pp=90}} Many Muslim leaders competed for influence and control over Muslim shrines in the city through which they sought to become representatives of [[Kashmiri Muslims]].{{sfn|Zutshi|2019|pp=59–62}} [[Sheikh Abdullah]], and his [[Jammu and Kashmir National Conference|National Conference]] (NC), eventually succeeded in doing so.

===Partition and Independence===
In 1947, after the princely state's [[Instrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir)|accession to India]] following an [[First Kashmir War|invasion]] of the state by Pakistani irregulars in the aftermath of the [[partition of India]], Indian forces were airlifted to Srinagar on 27 October to defend the city and the larger Kashmir valley.{{sfn|Zutshi|2019|p=99}} The National Conference also established a popular people's militia in the city to aid the army in their defence of the territory.{{sfn|Zutshi|2019|pp=99–100}}<ref>{{cite web |last=Whitehead |first=Andrew |url=https://www.thewire.in/article/gender/kashmir-women-militia |title=Kashmir's Forgotten Women's Militia |work=[[The Wire (India)|The Wire]] |date=24 October 2017 |access-date=21 May 2023}}</ref> Srinagar became the summer capital of the Indian state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] when it was established in 1952.

In 1963–1964, the relic at the Hazratbal Shrine in Srinagar briefly disappeared, causing political turmoil.{{sfn|Zutshi|2019|p=114}} Following this, the shrine was reconstructed between 1968 and 1979 in a Mughal-inspired style.{{sfn|Hamdani|2021|p=196}}
In 1989, Srinagar became the focus of the [[insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir]]. The city saw increased violence against the minority Hindus—particularly the [[Kashmiri Pandits]]—during the insurgency which resulted in their ultimate [[Exodus of Kashmiri Hindus|exodus]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bose |first=Sumantra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ACMe9WBdNAC |title=Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace |date=July 2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-02855-5|quote=As the uprising broke out across the Valley in early 1990, approximately one hundred thousand Pandits left their Valley homes for Jammu city and Delhi in a few weeks in February and March, in one of the most controversial episodes of the war in Kashmir."}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Majoul |first=Bootheina |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2VwpDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA14 |title=On Trauma and Traumatic Memory |date=23 June 2017 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |isbn=978-1-4438-7483-0}}</ref> Kashmiri Hindus constituted 8.39% of Srinagar's population in the 1981 census and 2.75% in the 2011 census.<ref>https://censusindia.gov.in/nada/index.php/catalog/31511/download/34692/29233_1981_POR.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=August 2024}}</ref><ref name="1891Census">{{Cite book |last1=Ram |first1=Bhag |date=1 January 1893 |title=Census of India, 1891.

==Geography==

The city is located on both the sides of the [[Jhelum River]], called ''Vyath'' in Kashmir. The river passes through the city and meanders through the valley, moving onward and deepening in the [[Wular Lake]]. The city is known for its nine old bridges, connecting the two parts of the city.

There are a number of lakes and swamps in and around the city. These include the [[Dal Lake|Dal]], the [[Nigeen Lake|Nigeen]], the [[Anchar Lake|Anchar]], [[Khushal Sar]], [[Gil Sar]] and [[Hokersar]].

Hokersar is a wetland situated near Srinagar. Thousands of migratory birds come to Hokersar from Siberia and other regions in the winter season. Migratory birds from Siberia and Central Asia use wetlands in Kashmir as their transitory camps between September and October and again around spring. These wetlands play a vital role in sustaining a large population of wintering, staging and breeding birds.

Hokersar is {{convert|14|km|abbr=on}} north of Srinagar, and is a world class wetland spread over {{convert|13.75|km2|abbr=on}} including lake and [[Marsh|marshy area]]. It is the most accessible and well-known of Kashmir's [[wetlands]] which include Hygam, Shalibug and Mirgund. A record number of migratory birds have visited Hokersar in recent years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/migratory-birds-flock-avian-paradise/article5331924.ece|work=[[The Hindu]]|title=Migratory birds flock avian paradise|date=9 November 2013|access-date=22 June 2017|author=Ahmed Ali Fayyaz|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109140840/http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/migratory-birds-flock-avian-paradise/article5331924.ece|archive-date=9 November 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

Birds found in Hokersar are migratory [[duck]]s and [[geese]] which include [[brahminy duck]], [[tufted duck]], [[gadwall]], [[garganey]], [[greylag goose]], [[mallard]], [[common merganser]], [[northern pintail]], [[common pochard]], [[ferruginous pochard]], [[red-crested pochard]], [[ruddy shelduck]], [[northern shoveller]], [[common teal]], and [[Eurasian wigeon]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Three lakh migratory birds throng Kashmir Valley|url=https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/three-lakh-migratory-birds-throng-kashmir-valley/article21024594.ece|work=The Hindu|date=28 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Migratory birds keep date with Kashmir valley again|url=https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/j-k/migratory-birds-keep-date-with-kashmir-valley-again-680213|work=The Tribune|date=9 November 2018}}</ref>

===Climate===
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Srinagar has a four-season [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') with hot summers and cool winters. The valley is surrounded by the Himalayas on all sides. Due to influence from Himalayan [[rain shadow]] and [[western disturbance]]s, Srinagar has year-round precipitation; the spring season is the wettest while autumn is the driest. The region also has less rain in the summer due to lying in the leeward side of the rain shadow which blocks the [[monsoon]] winds from the south. Winters are colder in the region than most areas with monsoon climates due to these influences and its elevation,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mahajan |first1=Anand |title=India & World Geography |date=29 April 2023 |publisher=YCT Expert Team |page=80 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KaYjEAAAQBAJ&dq=srinagar+rain+shadow+western+depression&pg=PA80}}</ref> with daily maximum temperatures averaging {{convert|7.1|°C|1}} in January and dropping below freezing point at night. 

Moderate to heavy snowfall occurs in winter and the [[Jammu–Srinagar National Highway|highway]] connecting Srinagar with the rest of India faces frequent blockades due to icy roads, landslides and avalanches. Summers are warm to hot, slightly moderated from its elevation, with a July daytime average of {{convert|30.0|°C|1}}. The average annual rainfall is around {{convert|697.5|mm}}. The highest temperature reliably recorded is {{convert|38.3|°C}} recorded on 10 July 1946, and the lowest is {{convert|-20.0|°C}} recorded on 6 February 1895.<ref name="NCEI"/>

===Stray dog controversy===
{{update section|date=December 2023}}

Srinagar's city government attracted brief international attention in March 2008 when it announced a mass poisoning program aimed at eliminating the city's population of stray dogs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna23500493|title=Indian authorities to poison 100K stray dogs – World news – South and Central Asia – NBC News|publisher=NBC News|date=6 March 2008 |access-date=7 March 2008}}</ref> Officials estimate that 100,000 stray dogs roam the streets of the city, which has a human population of just under 900,000. In a survey conducted by an NGO, it was found that some residents welcomed this program, saying the city was overrun by dogs, while critics contended that more humane methods should be used to deal with the animals.

The situation has become alarming with local news reports coming up at frequent intervals highlighting people, especially children being mauled by street dogs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/2012/May/12/stray-dogs-maul-over-3-dozen-55.asp|title=Stray dogs maul over 3 dozen|date=12 May 2012|newspaper=Greater Kashmir|access-date=21 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518122626/http://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/2012/May/12/stray-dogs-maul-over-3-dozen-55.asp|archive-date=18 May 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>
