Among cities in Mexico, the city of Chihuahua is highly ranked in human and social development. According to a [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Informe de Desarrollo Humano Municipal 2010-2020: Una Década de Transformaciones Locales en México |url=https://www.undp.org/es/mexico/publicaciones/informe-de-desarrollo-humano-municipal-2010-2020-una-decada-de-transformaciones-locales-en-mexico-0 |website=Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD) |date=2024 |accessdate=2024-07-19}}</ref> report on human development, Chihuahua municipality's HDI is 0.842 as of 2020 – among the highest in the country, only after municipalities in the [[Monterrey]] and [[Mexico City]] areas.

The location was chosen because it is the intersection of the rivers [[Río Chuviscar|Chuviscar]] and [[Sacramento River (Mexico)|Sacramento]]. It is also the midpoint between the [[Rio Grande|Río Bravo del Norte (Rio Grande)]] and the then-important mining city of [[Hidalgo del Parral]]. For much of the 18th century, Chihuahua served as the de facto capital of Nueva Vizcaya because most governors preferred to reside there rather than in [[Durango, Durango|Durango]], the capital of the province at that time.<ref name="Martin">{{cite book |last=Martin |first=Cheryl |title=Governance and Society in Colonial Mexico: Chihuahua in the Eighteenth Century |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w3i5lq8ZfpMC&q=history+of+chihuahua+city+mexico |access-date=January 29, 2013 |year=1996 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=9780804741682 |pages=1–2 |archive-date=July 30, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230730010055/https://books.google.com/books?id=w3i5lq8ZfpMC&q=history+of+chihuahua+city+mexico |url-status=live }}</ref>

Just as in other parts of Northern Mexico, [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] [[missionaries]] were an important influence during the colonial era, and the city became a meeting point for missionaries heading to and from the 'sierra', the mountainous region in western Chihuahua State where the native Tarahumara still live.

During the [[Mexican War of Independence|War of Independence]], the city saw little action. However, it was in Chihuahua where [[Miguel Hidalgo]], considered the Father of the Country, was held prisoner in the [[Federal Palace of Chihuahua]] and executed in 1811 at the nearby [[Government Palace of Chihuahua|Government Palace]] by the Spaniards.

During the [[Mexican–American War]], Chihuahua fell to U.S. forces in 1847, after the [[Mexican Army]] was defeated at the [[Battle of the Sacramento]], {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=out}} north of the city.

During the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French invasion]], President Benito Juárez made the city the seat of his [[government-in-exile]] from 1864 to 1867. During the presidency of [[Porfirio Díaz]] the city experienced explosive growth and became one of the most important cities in Mexico. The city became the seat for important banks and wealthy families.

The city was more involved during the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910–1917), for it became at times the operations base for the [[División del Norte]], the army led by [[Pancho Villa]]. Many sites and memories remain of the Revolutionary era; the most important of these is the [[Historical Museum of the Mexican Revolution]] at Villa's former estate house near downtown Chihuahua. La Quinta Luz was turned into a museum by his widow, Sra. [[María Luz Corral de Villa]], and is now managed by the federal government.

During the 20th century, the city grew in population and learned to take advantage of its proximity with the U.S. border. Until the establishment of foreign manufacturing plants in the 1970s, the city was largely a trade post for cattle and agricultural products. During the 1990s the city grew dramatically economically, becoming the third wealthiest municipality (per capita) in the republic, after [[Benito Juárez, D.F.|Benito Juárez]] borough of the [[Mexican Federal District|Federal District]] (Mexico City), and [[San Pedro Garza García]] in [[Nuevo León]].

In 2002, Mayor Jorge Barousse Moreno from the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI) died and was succeeded by Alejandro Cano Ricaud. During Cano's administration, the city experienced dramatic growth in the security sector when the Police Department was certified by the ISO and surveillance aircraft bought.

Between 2002 and 2005, the city experimented with the introduction of certain new commercial innovations, like the first large mall in the city, Plaza del Sol, and the rise of the commercial Zone of the Sun, all along the Periférico de la Juventud, one of the main thoroughfares in the city.

In 2004 Juan Blanco Zaldívar, of the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] (PAN), won the election for mayor (municipal president) of the city for the term 2004–2007. Since 2005, the International Festivals of Chihuahua have been celebrated by both the state and city governments during the months of September/October with art shows, plays, stage presentations and concerts by such bands as [[America (band)|America]], [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], [[Creedence]] and [[Los Lobos]] being held at venues throughout the city.

Elections for mayor for the term 2007–2010 were held at the beginning of July 2007; Carlos Borruel Baquera of the PAN defeated former mayor Alejandro Cano Ricaud (PRI) by less than one-quarter of a percentage point of almost 200,000 votes cast. The turnout of registered voters, at about 41%, was the lowest in years.

In January, 2010, Mayor Carlos Borruel submitted his resignation in order to campaign for election to the office of [[Governor of Chihuahua]]. His deputy, Lic. Alvaro Guillermo Madero Muñoz, assumed the office of mayor for the balance of his term. On July 4, 2013,
Javier Garfio Pacheco of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] won election for a 3-year term as mayor.

In December 2015, Eugenio Baeza Fares assumed office as mayor of the City of Chihuahua, after Javier Garfio Pacheco requested licence to pursue the possibility to become the candidate for the political party PRI to Governor of the State of Chihuahua.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://diario.mx/Estado/2015-12-04_1832a3ad/rinde-protesta-eugenio-baeza-como-alcalde-de-chihuahua/ |title=Rinde protesta Eugenio Baeza como alcalde de Chihuahua |first=Juan Carlos Núnez / El |last=Diario |access-date=2016-02-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110190630/http://diario.mx/Estado/2015-12-04_1832a3ad/rinde-protesta-eugenio-baeza-como-alcalde-de-chihuahua/ |archive-date=2016-01-10 |url-status=live}}</ref> After Garfio lost his bid for Governor Candidate, he returned and ended his period as mayor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://diario.mx/Estado/2016-03-16_65e64226/regresa-garfio-a-la-alcaldia-de-chihuahua/ |title=Regresa Garfio a la alcaldía de Chihuahua |first=Juan Carlos Núñez/ - El |last=Diario |access-date=2017-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413072742/http://diario.mx/Estado/2016-03-16_65e64226/regresa-garfio-a-la-alcaldia-de-chihuahua/ |archive-date=2017-04-13 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Foundation===
The origin of the city of Chihuahua begins with the discovery of the nearby mines and foundation of the population of [[Santa Eulalia (Chihuahua)|Santa Eulalia]] in 1652 by Spanish captain Diego del Castillo, however; due to the climate and constant attacks of the indigenous people the exploitation was suspended and Santa Eulalia remained several years uninhabited. Some fifty years later, in 1707, more wealthy mining discoveries were made, leading to the immediate population of Santa Eulalia and its prosperity.

However, Santa Eulalia is located in the middle of a mountain range and the difficult terrain hindered the construction and expansion of the city; because of this, when in 1709 the governor of [[New Biscay (New Spain)|Nueva Vizcaya]], [[Antonio de Deza y Ulloa]], with the instruction to found the head of the [[Real de Minas]] visited the population, decided to convene 16 notable neighbors (miners, traders, government officials and priests) to resolve with them the desirability of setting up Santa Eulalia herself at the head of the Royal de Minas or founding for them a new population in the nearby valley where the rivers converged [[Rio Chuvíscar' Chuvíscar]] and [[Sacramento River|Sacramento]].

On 12 October 1709<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oem.com.mx/elheraldodechihuahua/notas/n1012799.htm |title=300 years of the founding of Chihuahua |access-date=2019-09-10 |archive-date=2015-06-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626125018/http://www.oem.com.mx/elheraldodechihuahua/notas/n1012799.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> the vote of the notables was held on the founding of the Royal de Minas, eight of them voted for establishment in Santa Eulalia itself, while the remaining eight did so for foundation in the valley. Faced with the tie, the governor [[Antonio de Deza y Ulloa|Deza and Ulloa]] intervened with his deciding vote for foundation in the valley of the junta de los ríos; this is what is seen as the official foundation of Chihuahua and [[Antonio de Deza and Ulloa|Antonio Deza and Ulloa]] as its founder. The new Real de Minas was founded under the name of ''Real de Minas de San Francisco de Cuéllar'' in honor of the then [[Viceroy of New Spain]], [[Francisco Fernández de la Cueva Enríquez]], 10th. Duke of Alburquerque and Marquis de Cuéllar.

===Spanish Colony===
The growth of the Real de Minas, driven by mines and activity of the surrounding farms continued during the colony; because of this on October 1, 1718, it stands at the Royal of San Francisco de Cuéllar in Villa, with the name of ''San Felipe el Real de Chihuahua'''; Saint Philip in honor of the king [[Felipe V of Spain]] and being used for the first time the name of Chihuahua. At this time it is also solved the construction of a parish temple worthy for the village, to that end, the city council decided to impose a special tax on silver extracted from the mines of Santa Eulalia and with it was built the temple that today is the [[Catedra Scun]]. By the year 1786 the Villa de Chihuahua was a Mayor's and on April 1, 1797, the first census was lifted in the city of Chihuahua by Don Fructuoso Simón de Herrera with the following summary: 324 men, 396 women, total 720 inhabitants.

In the 18th century, an [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] with quarry arches pouring water into a fountain in the main square was built in the city. Then elegant houses appeared, some with wooden floors worked with rich woods brought from the mountains; these houses had orchards with fruit trees and vegetables, chicken coops and smaller cattle. Wealthy miners like the Irigoyen and Carbonel decorated their mansions with luxurious furniture, magnificent paintings, silverware and beautiful porcelain. In the name of the king of Spain came the "visitors" to investigate the morality and justice of the kingdoms and to collect taxes. They read heralds through the streets, which enacted good treatment of indigenous people; Despite this they were confined and restricted by their freedom, always being under the rule of the Spaniards, Creoles and mestizos. With this mixture of races he was writing, over the centuries, the history of the capital.
As in other parts of northern Mexico, the [[peregrino]]s [[Catholic]]ism greatly influenced the colonial era, and the city became a meeting point for pilgrims on their way to "La Sierra", a mountainous region in which the indigenous people had not yet converted to Catholicism.

Also built in the city was a college run by the Society of Jesus, which built a solid building on the east end of the village, later and after the expulsion of the Jesuits, the school building was used as a barracks, prison and mint.

===Independence===
[[File:La Trinidad - Chihuahua, Chihuahua - 01.JPG|thumb|left|The Trinity Methodist Temple.]]
The information on the beginning of the [[Independence of Mexico]] movement took a long time to reach the then Villa de Chihuahua, where in practice it had no effect, because of this [[The Realists]] decided that the trial of the insurgents apprehended in [[Acatita de Baján]] will be held in Chihuahua. On April 23 the prisoners entered Chihuahua to be tried and on June 26 the insurgents [[Ignacio Allende]], [[Mariano Jiménez]], [[Juan Aldama]] and [[Manuel Santamaría]] are shot in the convent of San Francisco. On 30 July, don [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] was shot in the courtyards of the military hospital, a place formerly the convent of Loreto. During the rest of the war of independence the situation in Chihuahua was practically identical and without any shock.

Once independence was consummated through the [[Treaties of Cordoba]], and after the ephemeral [[First Mexican Empire]], on 19 July 1823 the [[Union Congress]] issued a decree dividing the former province of the New Biscay in two, the Province of Durango and the Province of Chihuahua, and pointed by capital of the latter to the Villa of San Felipe el Real de Chihuahua, which from that moment was erected in city, and was called ''Chihuahua'''.<ref>Altamirano, 1988: 49.</ref>

===Post-Independent time===
During the [[Mexican–American War]], Chihuahua was occupied by a column of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] under [[Alexander William Doniphan|Alexander Doniphan]], who came from [New Mexico], had previously occupied [[Santa Fe (New Mexico)|Santa Fe]] and [[El Paso (Texas)|El Paso]]. For the defense of Chihuahua, the [[Battle of the Sacramento River|Battle of Sacramento]], on February 28, 1847, was enlisted with the invaders, with the full defeat of Mexican forces dispersed, the state government moved to [[Parral, Chihuahua|Parral]] and March 1 the U.S. military occupied the city.<ref>Altamirano, 1988: 93.</ref>
On March 7, 1848, the second occupation of the Anglo-Americans occurred and Governor Trías evacuated Chihuahua and was occupied by the invading chief Sterling Price. This situation lasted until 25 July, when the capital was evicted by the invaders. The legitimate authorities resettled in their official residence on 14 August of the same year.

===La Reforma===
On January 4, 1858, within the War of Reformation, which generally dominated the liberal party with the exception of two short seasons in which the conservatives occupied the capital by armed hands, Lieutenant Colonel Bruno Arriada and Mr. Juan N. Bárcenas seduced the garrison forces, proclaimed the Tacubaya Plan and set a half-hour deadline for the governor, Mr. Antonio Ochoa, to sign his accession. He retired to Aldama, gathered the national guard under the command of Colonel José Esteban crowned and the next 19 recaptured the capital.

On May 5, 1862, Don Mariano Sáenz built at his expense the first building specifically intended for theater, was called "Teatro de Zaragoza", was located in the street of La Libertad, near the current Plaza de Merino and premiered with the play "Los French in Mexico." On September 15, 1877, it was inaugurated by the governor of the state, General Angel Trías the "Teatro Betancourt", located in the street of La Libertad, built by the Jalisciense Don Miguel Betancourt, who was located in Chihuahua for more than twenty years. With a celebration of the "Scream of Independence", it lasted until May 27, 1904, when it was destroyed by fire. The "Coronado Theatre" opens, which was in ojinaga street and also disappeared from a fire. Mr. Betancourt built it.
On 12 October 1864, the head of the Federal Executive Power, Mr. Benito Juárez, arrived in the city on the occasion of the events of the French intervention and the empire. He was accompanied by his Secretaries of State, dispatched to the official residence of the state government. It remained until August 5, 1865, when it took the northern way; returned to the capital on 20 November and returned to the border on 9 December. The last season remained in Chihuahua from 17 June to 10 December 1866. At this time the 3 ships that overlook the now Victoria Street, part of the Municipal Palace, were sold to support the expenses demanded by the movement of troops on the occasion of the departure of President Juárez and his Ministers in the direction of Paso del Norte.

At the time of the Reformation it was in fact, for two years, capital of the Republic and seat of the Federal Powers, as the former Government Palace, today Museo Casa Juárez, became from 1864 to 1866, the National Palace and the residence of President Benito Juáre z and their ministers.

On March 25, 1866, a battle was set in the Plaza de Armas, the French imperialists were quartered in the Cathedral and General Terrazas was moving through Victoria and Independence streets, it was practically impossible to enter the cathedral, until it was decided that it would be cannoned and from Coronado and Ocampo streets they did, the 8&nbsp;kg bullet. weight fell just in the bell breaking it in half, after this fact the French went out to surrender and recovered the city. The bell was declared by the city hall historical monument and still today can be seen inside Cathedral.

===Porfirian era===
In 1875, the images began to be reproduced on paper or cardboard, based on the daguerreotype, and because in 1863 the Anglo-American Henry W. Barquer was established and on March 2, 1876, the telegraph was inaugurated in the short stretch between the government house (J street) not uarez. 321) and the stage station called "La Despedida" (Bolívar and 10a walk) On April 23, the service between Chihuahua and Rosales was inaugurated and in August 1877 with Mexico City. The city's first telegraphist was named Francisco Hernández.

On June 2, 1876, Colonel Angel Trías rebelled in favor of the Tuxtepec Plan, seize the capital and take the constitutional governor, Lic. Antonio Ochoa, prisoner. The term-appointed surrogate, Manuel de Herrera, dispatched successively in Cusihuiriachi, Guerrero and Camargo, raised the national guard and joined the government troops. Defeated by the Porphyrists at the Avalos ranch on 19 September, the legitimate authorities resumed the exercise of their duties in the capital.

On February 6, 1877, General Juan B. Camaño, at the head of a Tuxtepecana brigade, occupied the capital, deposed the constitutional authorities, assumed the political and military command of the state and began the new era.

For this reason, the expressed general issued a decree authorizing himself to assume the management of public business in the territory dominated by his forces and created three departments of state for their attention, namely the Relationships Ministry, Government and Communications, and Treasury and Development. Through these departments General Villa executed all the acts of a head of state until the end of 1915. At the end of 1915, the villist regime in the capital ended.

== Economy ==
Chihuahua is the twelfth largest city in Mexico, and one of the most industrialized. Manufacturing is very important and there are nine major industrial parks and 79 maquila manufacturing plants, which employ about 45,000 people. The city serves as an alternative destination for [[maquiladora]] operators who require quick access to the border but wish to avoid both the higher costs and higher turnover rates of employment of the immediate border area. Of all interior (non-border) locations in Mexico, Chihuahua has the largest maquiladora presence in Mexico. Some of the larger companies include Ford Motor Co., Sumitomo Electrical, Honeywell, Hallmark, and LG Electronics.

The entire state of Chihuahua is also a thriving economic center. Chihuahua's annual Gross State Product (GSP) is about $6.2 billion. There are more than 350 established manufacturing and assembly plants in the state; manufacturing accounts for a third of the total GSP, while trade and other services amount to 53.5%. Chihuahua has the largest amount of forested land in all of Mexico. Forty-four percent of Chihuahua's workers are employed in commerce and services, while a little over a third of the workforce is employed in mining and industry. In mining, Chihuahua state is the leading producer in the republic of non-ferrous minerals and zinc, and is second nationwide in silver extraction. Agricultural production makes up only 6% of the total GSP; however, the state is the leading producer of apples, nuts, cattle and sheep raising nationally, and second in pine and oak trees harvested.

== Contemporary life ==
[[File:ITESM Campus Chihuahua.jpg|thumb|The [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Chihuahua|Chihuahua campus of ITESM]].]]
The city's most important feature is its collection of industrial zones, in which foreign companies have manufacturing facilities, called ''[[maquiladora]]s'', which employ thousands of people. This [[light industry]] also requires professionals, both for manufacturing and for management; this training is provided by universities such as the Universidád Autónoma de Chihuahua,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uach.mx/ |title=Universidad Autónoma de Chihuahua – ORGULLO DE SER UACH |access-date=25 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626133459/http://www.uach.mx/ |archive-date=26 June 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> the Instituto Tecnológico de Chihuahua and Instituto Tecnológico de Chihuahua II. A number of private universities also exist, to include the Chihuahua campus of [[ITESM]].

The city's commercial sector has also been boosted by the growth of the middle-class. The wages paid by industries to management and high-level technical employees provide a cash flow unlike that of most Mexican cities.

The nightlife is lively, especially in the downtown, where some of the large, pre-revolutionary estate houses have been turned into nightclubs and dance halls, many featuring the best of Chihuahua's live bands.

Most U.S. franchise restaurants and fast-food establishments will be found in Chihuahua, mostly on the Periferico de la Juventud, north of downtown on Universidad Avenue, or on Libertad Street Pedestrian Way in the downtown, and are patronised by the city's youth and young professionals.

Chihuahua is best described as shaped as a large letter ''L'', with plains to the north and hills on both sides, as well as the south; it is crossed east-and-west by Teofilo Borunda Avenue, which follows the natural flow of the Chuviscar River. Borunda is crossed in the west by the Periferico de la Juventud, a major limited-access highway running north-and-south. The main entrance to the city from the north (from the direction of Ciudad Juárez) is Tecnológico Avenue, part of the [[Pan-American Highway]].

The geography of the city is dominated by three hills that appear in the coat of arms: Cerro Grande, Cerro Coronel and Santa Rosa, the last of which is fully covered by the city. The Cerro Grande has a monumental cross that is lighted each Christmas.

To the east and northeast, is the Sierra Nombre de Dios, across the Sacramento River from the city. Contained therein, off of Heroico Colegio Militar Ave, are the Nombre de Dios Caverns, a natural display of minerals and underground formations. To the far east and south is [[General Roberto Fierro Villalobos International Airport]] and the highway to the US-Mexican border crossing at [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]].

== Transportation ==
[[File:Bridge in Chihuahua City.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bridges being built in the city, circa September 2005. The growing traffic in the city caused a massive construction plan for more and better roads.]]
Chihuahua is served by [[Roberto Fierro Villalobos International Airport]] ([[IATA Airport code]]: CUU) with connections to major Mexican cities and international destinations to Denver, Dallas, Houston, and Phoenix (Dec 2019). The airport serves as the state's largest in both cargo volume and passengers and is currently being expanded accordingly.

Chihuahua is also the starting point for the [[Ferrocarril Chihuahua al Pacífico|Chihuahua–Pacific Railroad]] with a terminus in [[Los Mochis]], Sinaloa, and is also served by [[Ferromex]], a private Mexican railroad. There is a large central depot for intercity buses in the south side of the city serving as a hub for the county's main bus companies as well as regional, state, and international bus companies.

The city had a serious problem with property crime, especially theft and graffiti by [[Graffiti|taggers]]. Also, drug-related murders, including murders of law-enforcement officers (38 in 2007 according to a March 2008 issue of the newspaper ''Diario de Chihuahua'') by traffickers led by [[Joaquín Guzmán Loera]] ("el Chapo", or "Shorty"), have been on the rise. The federal police and the army have moved into the city to conduct anti-drug operations; it seems that their activity may have a positive effect; the indices of property crime and murder have fallen<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oem.com.mx/elheraldodechihuahua/notas/n2298658.htm |title=Tiende a bajar el índice de delitos |access-date=25 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924055320/http://www.oem.com.mx/elheraldodechihuahua/notas/n2298658.htm |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> since 2010, with the result that Chihuahua is safer now than in years past.

The city of Chihuahua has a number of tourist sites, including the [[Museums of Chihuahua|museums in Chihuahua]], the baroque [[Cathedral of Chihuahua|Metropolitan Cathedral]], seat of the [[Archdiocese of Chihuahua|Archdiocese]] (and the resting place of [[Cathedral Church of Saint Patrick in El Paso|St Peter of Jesus Maldonado]], a [[Cristero]] martyr of the 1930s), dating from the 18th century, the Government Palace from the early 19th century, and the [[City Hall of Chihuahua|City Hall]] from the turn of the 20th century, on the [[Plaza de Armas]] across from the cathedral.

During the French invasion and the Second Empire, which ended with the execution of the [[Habsburg]] Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian]] in 1867, the constitutional president, [[Benito Juárez]] García traveled the country, searching for support wherever he could. He found it in 1864 when he settled his cabinet and [[government-in-exile]] here in the city at the address now known as Ave. Juárez 321, and incidentally, making Chihuahua the only city, aside from Mexico City, to be the capital of the Republic. The [[Museo Casa Juarez]], now known as ''The Museum of Republican Loyalty'', has been faithfully restored to the appearance it had when President Juárez lived here from 1864 through 1866.

The city offers the service of the touristic "Trolley el Tarahumara" which is a tourist bus that goes around to all the main museums and monuments in the downtown (starting its route at the Plaza de Armas), including parks like the ''Central Park "El Palomar"'', a large park that has a collection of sculptures, including one depicting three doves (palomas, hence the park's name) and a monumental flagpole, flying one of the largest flags in the Republic, as well as a statue of one of Chihuahua's favourite sons, actor [[Anthony Quinn]], in his role as '[[Zorba the Greek]]', as well as many others. The city is known for its classical and modern sculpture,{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} as seen on any main boulevard or avenue.{{tone inline|date=April 2019}} Included are works by Espino, Baltazar, Ponzanelli and Sebastian, the latter being a native of Chihuahua.

Particularly noteworthy are the [[murals]] in the [[Government Palace of Chihuahua|Government Palace]] and the ''Paraninfo'', or University Auditorium (in the Literary and Scientific Institute building) both depicting the history of the State of Chihuahua, and both fronting
upon the ''Plaza Hidalgo'' in the downtown, and catter-cornered from the Plaza Mayor. Also of note is the ''Quinta Gameros'', one of the largest estate houses in pre-revolutionary Chihuahua City, now the state museum for the decorative arts, and the former [[Federal Palace of Chihuahua]] on [[Venustiano Carranza]] Street, north of the Government Palace, which is now a museum and contains the cell in which [[Miguel Hidalgo]] spent his final days, and is a national shrine.

The ''Mammoth Museum'', at Gomez Morin (also Calle 27a) and Ave. Juarez, is the city
natural history museum and contains 13 halls detailing prehistoric life from the [[dinosaur]]s through the reign of the [[mammal]]s, or the [[Cenozoic]] Era. It also has exhibits of prehistoric art. The ''Semilla'' Museo Centro de Ciencia y Tecnología, or ''Seed Centre Museum of Science and Technology'', on Teofilo Borunda and Lisboa in the downtown, is a creative learning centre and interactive science museum for children.

The Feria ([[Fair]]) of Santa Rita, known throughout the Republic, is held during the last two weeks of May and features internationally known recording artists in concert. The fair has been held annually for decades. In addition, the university [[Orchestra|symphony]] performs at the Paraninfo weekly during the summer months, and features international guest artists in classical and pop concerts. The [[Plaza de Toros "La Esperanza"]], or bull ring, 'La Esperanza' is located on Teofilo Borunda on the north side of the river, and features corridas ([[bullfight]]s) during the summer and fall.

The Plaza Mayor is an important square in the downtown that displays fountains, green spaces and a collection of monuments depicting local heroes. The main monument in the Plaza Mayor is the "Ángel de la Libertad" that was built in 2003 representing the freedom of all Mexicans, especially Chihuahua's people. It was inaugurated during the Independence Day festivities on September 15 of that same year. The angel has a sword with a [[laser]] light at the tip, and is capable of rotating 360° over its axis.
