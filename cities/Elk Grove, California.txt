[[Spain|Spanish]] explorer [[Gabriel Moraga]] entered the region in 1808, naming the valley "Sacramento Valley" in honor of ''Sacramento,'' the Holy Sacrament in Spanish, giving the northerly city of Sacramento its name.<ref name=sac>{{cite web |url=http://www.bycitylight.com/cities/us-ca-sacramento-history.php |title=Sacramento, California City History and Historical Figures |website=ByCityLight.com |access-date=January 2, 2016 |archive-date=February 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207034108/http://www.bycitylight.com/cities/us-ca-sacramento-history.php |url-status=live }}</ref> A writer on Moraga's expedition wrote of the region: 
<blockquote>Canopies of oaks and cottonwoods, many festooned with grapevines, overhung both sides of the blue current. Birds chattered in the trees and big fish darted through the pellucid depths. The air was like champagne, and (the Spaniards) drank deep of it, drank in the beauty around them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cathedralsacramento.org/ |title=Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament - Sacramento, California |publisher=Cathedralsacramento.org |date=November 11, 2012 |access-date=November 16, 2012 |archive-date=November 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116093832/http://www.cathedralsacramento.org/ |url-status=live }}</ref></blockquote>

In the following decades, Elk Grove remained a small farming community with little urban development. In the late 1980s, suburban development projects began to spring up around the community, specifically in the north near Sacramento. These were meant to serve Sacramento's population, as well as San Francisco commuters seeking a commuting community relatively near the San Francisco Bay Area where they could reside. Such changes triggered a period of rapid growth. On July 1, 2000, Elk Grove [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a city. The city's growth peaked in 2004 and 2005, when Elk Grove was declared the fastest growing city in the US.<ref>{{Cite web |date=June 21, 2006 |title=Sacramento Suburb Tops Fast-Growth List |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-jun-21-me-census21-story.html |access-date=June 16, 2022 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US |archive-date=June 16, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220616082355/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-jun-21-me-census21-story.html |url-status=live }}</ref>
