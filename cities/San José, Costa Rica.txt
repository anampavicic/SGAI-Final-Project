Founded in 1736 by order of [[Cabildo (council)|Cabildo de León]], the population of San José rose during the 18th century through the use of colonial planning. It has historically been a city of strategic importance, having been the capital of Costa Rica three times. More than a million people pass through it daily. It is home to the [[Museo Nacional de Costa Rica]], the [[National Theatre of Costa Rica]], and [[La Sabana Metropolitan Park]]. [[Juan Santamaría International Airport]] serves the city.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of San José, Costa Rica}}
The population of San José grew during the eighteenth-century colonization planning, which was different from the traditional foundation plans of Spanish cities in the continent of Central America.

Founded in 1736 by order of [[Cabildo (council)|Cabildo de León]], its objective was to concentrate the scattered inhabitants of the Aserrí Valley.<ref name="auto">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nacion.com/el-pais/historia-de-san-jose-ciudad-hace-200-anos/QVMJQ6J4ARAJJAQNNSNNB4B5SE/story/ |title=Historia de San José: Ciudad hace 200 años |work=La Nación, Grupo Nación |access-date=2018-11-01 |language=es-LA |archive-date=15 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015201828/https://www.nacion.com/el-pais/historia-de-san-jose-ciudad-hace-200-anos/QVMJQ6J4ARAJJAQNNSNNB4B5SE/story/ |url-status=live }}</ref> De León thus ordered the construction of a chapel near the area known as {{lang|es|La Boca del Monte}} which was completed a year later. That year St. Joseph was chosen as parish patron, hence its name. The chapel, which was very modest, was erected with help from the church of Cartago.<ref>{{cite web|language=es-ES|title=viajes a Costa Rica|url=https://archive.org/details/monteverde|website=archive.org - ES}}<!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator --></ref>

Unlike neighboring Cartago, San José was not founded by formal decree and thus lacked a city government. It was not until the enactment of the Constitution of Cádiz in 1812 that San José had its first city government. On 18 October 1813, the area was first defined as a city by presbyter Florencio del Castillo, on behalf of the Spanish government, a title which was then lost in 1814 when [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]] annulled the proceedings of the courts. The municipal government was restored in 1820 along with the title of city and in 1823 San José became the capital of Costa Rica.<ref name="auto"/><ref>[http://www.spanishabroad.com/prog_teen/cityg_sanjose/history.htm History of San José, Costa Rica] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303224952/http://www.spanishabroad.com/prog_teen/cityg_sanjose/history.htm |date=3 March 2012}}, by [http://www.spanishabroad.com/index.htm Spanish Abroad, Inc.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817041833/http://www.spanishabroad.com/index.htm |date=17 August 2007}}</ref> This makes San José one of the youngest capital cities in [[Latin America]] by year of conception.

Population and economic growth were spurred by improvements in access to water and the installment of the Tobacco Factory in 1782. The accumulation of capital brought by tobacco plantations allowed the city to economically surpass neighboring provinces.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nacion.com/el-pais/historia-de-san-jose-ciudad-hace-200-anos/QVMJQ6J4ARAJJAQNNSNNB4B5SE/story/ |title=Historia de San José: ciudad hace 200 años |work=La Nación, Grupo Nación |access-date=2018-11-01 |language=es-LA |archive-date=15 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015201828/https://www.nacion.com/el-pais/historia-de-san-jose-ciudad-hace-200-anos/QVMJQ6J4ARAJJAQNNSNNB4B5SE/story/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The first modern urban neighborhood carries the name of its founder, the French [[coffee]] entrepreneur [[Monsieur Amon]], and was created in the late 19th century, in line with [[Belle Époque]] contemporary architecture. Barrio Amon, as well as the National Theatre, remain symbols of the so-called Costa Rican coffee golden age.

Today San José is a modern city with bustling commerce and brisk expressions of art and architecture. Spurred by the country's improved tourism industry, it is a significant destination and stopover for foreign visitors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0843474.html |title=San José, city, Costa Rica |access-date=28 August 2007 |archive-date=14 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014122835/http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0843474.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

San José exerts a strong influence because of its proximity to other cities ([[Alajuela]], [[Heredia, Costa Rica|Heredia]] and [[Cartago, Costa Rica|Cartago]]) and the country's demographic assemblage in the Central Valley.<ref>[http://www.worldbank.org/urban/symposium2005/papers/pujol.pdf In San José, Costa Rica, effective metropolitan planning and selective infrastructure investment can improve the quality of life for the poor] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806084959/http://worldbank.org/urban/symposium2005/papers/pujol.pdf |date=6 August 2007 }}, by Rosendo Pujol, researcher of [http://www.produs.ucr.ac.cr ProDUS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020530160254/http://www.produs.ucr.ac.cr/ |date=30 May 2002 }} on the World Bank Urban Research Symposium in Brasilia, Brasil, 4–6 April 2005</ref>

=== Municipal Council ===
Like the mayor and vice mayors, members of the Municipal Council (called {{lang|es|regidores}}) are elected every four years. San José's Municipal Council has 11 seats for regidores and their substitutes, who can participate in meetings but not vote unless the owning regidor ({{Lang|es|regidor propietario}}) is absent.<ref name="codmuni" /> The current president of the Municipal Council is Together San José Party member, Mariana de los Ángeles Zúñiga Pérez, with the regidor for More San José Party, Juan Diego Gómez González, as vice president.<ref name="concmuni">{{Cite web |author=Municipalidad de San José |date=19 June 2024 |title=Sesión Ordinaria 010 - 2024 |url=https://www.msj.go.cr/docu/ActasMunicipales/Corporaci%C3%B3n%202024%20-%202028/Sesiones%20Ordinarias/Sesi%C3%B3n%20Ordinaria%20010%20del%2009%20de%20julio%20de%202024.pdf |access-date=23 July 2024 |website=Municipalidad de San José |language=es}}</ref> The Municipal Council's composition for the 2024-2028 period is as follows:

==Education==
[[Costa Rica]] has developed high education levels. As of 2011 97.6% of the population over 10 was literate,<ref>{{cite web |author=Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos |title=Censos 2011 {{!}} Instituto Nacional De Estadistica Y Censos |url=http://www.inec.go.cr/censos/censos-2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201214043335/https://www.inec.go.cr/censos/censos-2011 |archive-date=14 December 2020 |access-date=2018-11-01 |website=www.inec.go.cr |language=es}}</ref> 96% of children aged 6–11 attend primary school and 71% of students of high-school age attend high-school.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicef.org/costarica/docs/cr_pub_Folleto_MICS_Educacion.pdf |title=Costa Rica- Alfabetizacion y Educación (Costa Rica- Literacy and Education) |author=Costa Rica Ministry of Education, Unicef, MICS |date=2011 |website=Unicef.org}}{{Dead link|date=February 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The country as a whole has the highest education levels in Central America and one of the best in Latin America. This is especially true for San José, the nation's educational hub home to a large number of public and private universities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.altillo.com/universidades/costarica/universidades_costarica_sanjose.asp |title=Universidades de San José (Privadas y Públicas) |publisher=Altillo.com |access-date=8 July 2013 |archive-date=3 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403085828/http://altillo.com/universidades/costarica/universidades_costarica_sanjose.asp |url-status=live }}</ref>

University of Santo Tomas, the first university of Costa Rica, was established here in 1843.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archivo.ucr.ac.cr/ustot.html |title=La Universidad de Santo Tomás (1843-1888) |website=Universidad de Costa Rica archive |access-date=19 November 2018 |archive-date=30 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130225938/http://archivo.ucr.ac.cr/ustot.html |url-status=live }}</ref> That institution maintained close ties with the Roman Catholic Church and was closed in 1888 by the progressive and anti-clerical government of President Bernardo Soto Alfaro as part of a campaign to modernize public education. The schools of law, agronomy, fine arts, and pharmacy continued to operate independently, but Costa Rica had no university proper until 1940, when those four schools were re-united to establish the modern [[University of Costa Rica|University of Costa Rica (UCR)]], during the reformist administration of President Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia. The [[University for Peace]], an intergovernmental organization with university status, established by the United Nations General Assembly in 1980, is located in San José.

The city's public education system is composed of pre-schools, elementary and high schools (from grades 7 to 11), which are located in all of the city's districts and are under the supervision of the Ministry of Public Education. Nevertheless, private institutions do exist within the city. These educational institutions range from pre-schools to universities. Most tend to be bilingual, teaching subjects in either French or English and Spanish, among other languages, apart from just teaching a certain language.

==Security==
San José is one of Latin America's safest cities. As of 19 June 2012, both city and nation reduced their crime indices considerably.{{clarify timeframe|date=May 2017}} Nationwide, crime was reduced from 12.5 to 9.5 incidents per 100,000 inhabitants.

In 2012, new police equipment was issued by the government, and the security budget was increased. President [[Laura Chinchilla]]'s government donated vehicles and other equipment to the police department on at least two occasions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prensalibre.cr/pl/nacional/59781-china-dona-200-patrullas-con-garantia-de-repuestos.html |title=CHINA DONA 200 PATRULLAS CON GARANTÍA DE REPUESTOS |publisher=Prensalibre.cr |access-date=8 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130210070506/http://www.prensalibre.cr/pl/nacional/59781-china-dona-200-patrullas-con-garantia-de-repuestos.html |archive-date=10 February 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The city's greater metropolitan area (in Los Yoses, San Pedro) also serves as the headquarters of the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]].

===Theaters and auditoriums===
San José has a number of theaters, many with European-inspired architecture. These buildings serve as the city's main tourist attractions, not only because of their architecture, but because of the cultural, musical, and artistic presentations and activities, which include traditional and modern Costa Rican and San Josefinan culture.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-10-23 |title=San Jose Costa Rica: Complete Guide to the Capital City |url=https://www.costaricavibes.com/destinations/central-valley/san-jose/ |access-date=2023-10-10 |language=en-US}}</ref>

The most well-known are:
*The National Theater of Costa Rica (''[[Teatro Nacional de Costa Rica]]'').
*The Melico Salazar Theater (''[[Teatro Popular Melico Salazar]]'').
*The National Auditorium of The Children's Museum of Costa Rica (''[[Museo de los Niños (Costa Rica)|Museo de los Niños]]'').

The [[National Theater of Costa Rica]] (considered the finest historic building in the capital and known for its exquisite interior which includes its lavish Italian furnishings<ref>{{cite book |author=Baker, C.P. |title=Costa Rica |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] [[Eye Witness Travel Guides]] |year=2005 |page=60}}</ref>) and the Melico Salazar Theater present drama, dance performances and concerts throughout the year. Nevertheless, other 'smaller' theaters can be found throughout the city and provide a large array of entertainment.

El Teatro Variedades (1892) is San José's oldest theater.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://si.cultura.cr/infraestructura/teatro-variedades.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022104843/http://si.cultura.cr/infraestructura/teatro-variedades.html |title=Teatro Variedades |website=si.cultura.cr |archive-date=October 22, 2014}}</ref>

{{See also|List of museums in Costa Rica}}
San José is also host to various museums. These museums allow visitors to view Costa Rican history, scientific discoveries, pre-Columbian era culture and art, as well as modern Costa Rican art. The city is also host to the nation's museum of gold and museum of jade.

Some of the city's main museums are:

*The Children's Museum ([[Museo de los Niños]])

*The Museum of Pre-Columbian Gold ([[Pre-Columbian Gold Museum|Museo de Oro Precolombino]])
*The Museum of Costa Rican Art

*The Museum of Jade ([[Museo del Jade Marco Fidel Tristán Castro]])

===Parks, plazas, and zoos===
San José is home to many parks and squares (plazas in Spanish); where one can find gazebos, open green areas, recreational areas, lakes, fountains, statues and sculptures by Costa Rican artists and many different bird, tree and plant species.

====Parks and zoos====
The city's primary parks include:

*The National Park (''Parque Nacional'')
*Morazán Park (''Parque Morazán'') — with Neoclassical Temple of Music (''Templo de la Música'') pavilion
*[[La Sabana Metropolitan Park|La Sabana Metropolitan Park (''Parque Metropolitano La Sabana'')]] — largest park and "the lungs of San José," in Mata Redonda District (west city)
*Peace Park (''Parque de la Paz'')
*Okayama Park (''Parque Okayama'') — [[Japanese garden|Japanese style garden]] and architectural elements, ornamental [[pond]]s, and garden sculptures
*Simón Bolívar Zoo — the city's only zoo, with a large variety of native Costa Rican and exotic animals and plant species

====Plazas====
[[Plaza]]s, or [[town square]]s, are very prominent across San José's districts.

*[[Plaza de la Democracia]]
*Culture Square — ''La Plaza de La Cultura''

==Transportation==
San José has several internal transportation networks that connect the city districts and metropolitan area; as well as national transportation networks that connect the city to other parts of Costa Rica.

San José is undergoing modernization in transportation. In February of 2011, the former mayor, [[Johnny Araya Monge|Johnny Araya]], along with then Costa Rican President, [[Laura Chinchilla]], announced the establishment of an urban tramway system that will, in its first phase, cover the central core of the city going from west to east.

On 27 September 2012, San José disclosed plans to install its first street signs, about 22,000 signs and plaques. It is estimated that the lack of proper street names for directions causes the loss of $720 million a year by the Inter-American Development Bank in 2008, due to undelivered, returned or re-sent mail.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cota |first=Isabella |title=San Jose, Costa Rica to install its first street signs |url=https://news.yahoo.com/san-jose-costa-rica-install-first-street-signs-001544571.html |publisher=Yahoo News |access-date=28 September 2012 |archive-date=11 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211153425/http://news.yahoo.com/san-jose-costa-rica-install-first-street-signs-001544571.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Train===
The ''[[Instituto Costarricense de Ferrocarriles]]'', or the state-owned railway institute, is in charge of all of Costa Rica's railways. In 2004, this institution began work on the establishment of an inter-urban railway network. This network would connect Tibás, Heredia, San Antonio de Belén, Pavas, San Pedro de Montes de Oca, Sabanilla, and Curridabat, among other locations.

There are plans to expand this inter-urban railway system into Cartago, Alajuela, and the Juan Santamaría International Airport.

Trains run to Heredia from ''Estación Atlantico and San Antonio de Belen'' and from ''Estación Pacifico''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Horario de Tren, www.horariodetren.com |url=http://horariodetren.com/cr/ |title=Urban Train in Costa Rica |publisher=Horariodetren.com |access-date=8 July 2013 |archive-date=8 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708101836/http://www.horariodetren.com/cr/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Taxis===
San José public taxi services complement the urban transportation network. Taxis are characterized by their red color and belong to registered cooperatives. There are other taxi services which do not belong to the registered system, there are also taxis from the airport that are usually orange.

The car-sharing company [[Uber]] is active in Costa Rica and, despite repeated clashes with and strikes by taxi drivers protesting unfair competition, continues to operate in the country.{{when?|date=May 2022}}

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Costa Rican cuisine}}
Costa Rican cuisine, called {{lang|es|comida típica}} ("traditional food"), is generally not spicy. Throughout San José, the most popular food is the national dish of {{lang|es|gallo pinto}} ("painted chicken"), which is black beans served with white rice. ''Gallo pinto'' is usually served for breakfast with tortillas and {{lang|es|natilla}}, a thin sour cream. Costa Rican restaurants serving traditional food at an affordable price are called ''[[:wikt:soda#Spanish|sodas]]'' and usually offer substantial {{lang|es|casados}} for lunch and dinner. A ''casado'' (meaning "married" or "married man" in Spanish) consists of rice, beans, and meat, with cabbage-and-tomato salad, fried plantains, and tortillas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalgourmet.com/destinations/costarica/costcuis.html |title=Costa Rica: Cuisine |publisher=Globalgourmet.com |access-date=8 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728112031/http://www.globalgourmet.com/destinations/costarica/costcuis.html |archive-date=28 July 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[San José Central Market]], in downtown San José, has numerous food markets and sodas.
