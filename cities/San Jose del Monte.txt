'''San Jose del Monte,''' officially the '''City of San Jose del Monte''' (abbreviated as '''SJDM''' or '''CSJDM'''; {{lang-fil|Lungsod ng San Jose del Monte}}), is a 1st class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Bulacan]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 651,813 people, making it the largest local government unit within the province of Bulacan and [[Central Luzon]], and the 18th most populated city in the Philippines.

It was proclaimed as a component city on September 10, 2000, through Republic Act No. 8797. Its conversion into a highly urbanized city was by the virtue of Proclamation No. 1057 issued by [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Rodrigo Duterte]] on December 4, 2020; the conversion was rejected on a referendum held on October 30, 2023, by the voters of Bulacan including the concerned city.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Patinio |first=Ferdinand |date=November 1, 2023 |title=Bulacan voters reject conversion of SJDM into highly urbanized city |work=[[Philippine News Agency]] |url=https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1212884 |access-date=November 2, 2023}}</ref>

Located in the southeast of the province, it is bordered by the cities of [[Caloocan]] and [[Quezon City]] in [[Metro Manila]] to the south, by the town of [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Rodriguez]] in [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]] to the east, the towns of [[Santa Maria, Bulacan|Santa Maria]] and [[Marilao]] to the west and [[Norzagaray]] to the north. San Jose del Monte is {{convert|65|km}} from [[Malolos]] and {{convert|30|km}} from [[Manila]].

The city is home to some of the biggest resettlement areas in the Philippines like the Sapang Palay resettlement area spread over 36 barangays, Pabahay 2000 in Barangay Muzon South, and Towerville in Barangay Minuyan Proper. Most of the city's population come from former informal settlers along the creeks, esteros, riverbanks and railway tracks of Metro Manila.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/2013/08/08/1063421/san-jose-del-monte-declares-moratorium-relocation-projects | title=San Jose del Monte declares moratorium on relocation projects | work=The Philippine Star | date=August 8, 2013 | access-date=October 13, 2015 | author=Dino Balabo | archive-date=September 17, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917193402/http://www.philstar.com/nation/2013/08/08/1063421/san-jose-del-monte-declares-moratorium-relocation-projects | url-status=live }}</ref>

==Etymology==
San Jose del Monte derived its name from [[Saint Joseph]], whose statue was found in a veritable forest. The hunters called it as such, which means “Saint Joseph of the Mountain” in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

==History==
Early accounts of the founding of the city, as gathered from the old people, contend that it was formerly a part of the town of [[Meycauayan]]. This is supported by a decree from the [[Archbishop of Manila]] dated March 1750 on the creation of new municipalities. The municipality of San Jose del Monte was then officially founded on 2 March 1752.<ref name="Govt website"/>

The decree included the list of families who volunteered to be relocated. These families, most if not all from Lagulo (now Malhacan) in Meycauayan, brought with them rice, wine, nganga, and salt in exchange for the wild pigs, deer, yantok, and almasigan of the Itas and Dumagats, the native inhabitants of the area. Solares, including intended lots for main roads, were peacefully distributed to the new occupants after being measured and surveyed.<ref name="Govt website">{{cite web|title=History of San Jose Del Monte|url=http://csjdm.gov.ph/history-of-san-jose-del-monte/|publisher=City of San Jose Del Monte, Bulacan, Philippines|accessdate=June 30, 2017|archive-date=January 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170115115949/http://csjdm.gov.ph/history-of-san-jose-del-monte/|url-status=live}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

In all probability, the hunters reported their findings to the parish priest of Meycauayan. It was said that the priest built a stone church at the site where the town proper is now located. The statue was installed in the new church. Extant Catholic Church records reveal that the first parish priest was Father Antonio de Moral. He took charge of the parish in 1845.

During the [[Philippine Revolution|revolt against Spain]], the town became a battleground between the [[Katipunan|Katipuneros]] and the Spanish forces. The revolutionaries lost and the vengeful Spanish soldiers burned down the settlement. The townspeople fled for their lives to nearby towns. At the advent of American rule, it was made a part of Santa Maria until 1918 when the town was recreated and Ciriaco Gallardo appointed the first municipal president. Public schools were opened at the start of the American regime but due to the scarcity of the population, the highest grade organized was at the fourth grade.

During the Japanese occupation, the town became an ideal hiding place for the locally recognized guerrillas because of the town's hilly and wooden terrain. The [[Japanese Imperial Army]] took over the local government of San Jose del Monte from 1942 to 1943. In resistance, the municipality formed its guerrilla unit. San Jose del Monte experienced large casualties when the Americans bombed the town center on 11 January 1945, and again on 14 January 1945. When the combined Filipino and American troops came, peace reigned but not for long.

At the height of the [[Hukbalahap Rebellion]], the town was raided on 10 October 1950. The Huks burned down the town hall. The town was raided for the second time on 21 March 1951. The Huks did not succeed because of the precautionary measures instituted by the town officials after which the Huks were gradually eliminated.

In the 1980s, thousands of informal settlers from [[Metro Manila]] were relocated to San Jose del Monte. Due to the large number of residents, Bulacan Governor [[Roberto Pagdanganan]] recalled in 1996 that the relocation did not ensure new livelihoods for its informal settlers, thus turning many squatters toward criminality; he noted that the town had the highest crime rate in the province according to police reports.<ref>{{cite news|last=Reyes|first=Carmela|title=Source of income must for resettled squatters|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=D_4tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YwsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3888%2C3522814|access-date=July 5, 2022|work=[[Manila Standard]]|publisher=Kamahalan Publishing Corp.|date=January 24, 1996|page=13|archive-date=July 5, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220705190705/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=D_4tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YwsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3888,3522814|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1988, [[Eduardo Roquero]] was elected mayor of the municipality by a margin of eight (8) votes against his closest opponent, reelectionist Reynaldo Villano.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rivera|first=Lolita T.|title=Mayor proclaimed|work=[[Manila Standard]]|publisher=Standard Publications, Inc.|date=May 28, 1988|page=7}}</ref>

A plebiscite was held on September 10, 2000. Despite a low turnout, the cityhood was approved mostly by migrants, mainly from [[Metro Manila]] which composed seventy percent of the residents by then; only nine of the 59 villages voted against the bill. The official proclamation was held in the evening. San Jose del Monte became the first city in Bulacan since [[Malolos]] failed in the cityhood bid in December 1999.<ref name="c0912PDI">{{cite news |last=Reyes |first=Carmela |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=83UE6yvegO4C&dat=20000912&printsec=frontpage&hl=en |title=Migrant vote: San Jose del Monte Bulacan's 1st city |newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=September 12, 2000 |access-date=November 2, 2023 |page=A12 |via=[[Google News Archive]] |archive-date=November 2, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231102015350/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=83UE6yvegO4C&dat=20000912&printsec=frontpage&hl=en |url-status=live }}</ref> (Malolos was eventually declared a city in 2002 by the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] which had reversed the official result following a recount.)<ref>{{cite news |last=Gamos |first=Ben |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sW8bAAAAIBAJ&dq=malolos+cityhood+recount&pg=PA15&article_id=6629,1273942 |title=Comelec rules Malolos a city |newspaper=[[Manila Standard]] |date=October 12, 2002 |access-date=November 2, 2023 |page=B14 |via=[[Google Books]] |archive-date=November 4, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231104050302/https://books.google.com/books?id=sW8bAAAAIBAJ&dq=malolos+cityhood+recount&pg=PA15&article_id=6629,1273942 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was also recorded as the [[List of cities in the Philippines|country's 86th chartered city]].<ref name="Govt website" />

==Geography==
The elevation of the city ranges from approximately {{convert|40|to|900|m|sp=us}} above sea level; the relief transitions from warm lowland to cool upland as one goes eastward. This is because the city is part of the Sierra Madre mountain range. Plains and river valley flats characterize the western and southwestern quadrant. The central portion and much of its eastern section are made up of undulating hills with low relief. High relief areas and moderate slopes best describe its extreme eastern and northwestern quadrant. Slopes of 3%-8% are extensively found in the city, particularly in the western half. Slopes of 30%-50% comprise the smallest portion of the total land area.

The rivers and creeks that flow in San Jose del Monte are direct tributaries of the [[Angat River]], which flows from the Angat Reservoir. Major natural waterways of San Jose del Monte are the Kipungok, Santo Cristo, and Santa Maria River systems. Kipungok River separates San Jose del Monte from Caloocan and Rodriguez. It is directly connected to the Marilao River, which flows downwards to [[Manila Bay]]. Draining to these rivers are creeks and streams, which act as catchment areas for the surface water runoff of the city. Among these are the Bigte, Kantulot, Katinga, and Salamin creeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://csjdm.gov.ph/socioeconomic-and-physical-profile/geophysical-sector/|title=San Jose del Monte City Government (Geography)|website=San Jose del Monte City|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022063107/http://csjdm.gov.ph/socioeconomic%2Dand%2Dphysical%2Dprofile/geophysical%2Dsector/|archive-date=October 22, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===General Land Use===

Growing commercial, residential, and light industrial areas, are found all over the city at major road intersections and along major thoroughfares. However, the bulk of San Jose del Monte's built-up areas are mostly west of Quirino Highway at the primary level to gently sloping 8% terrain, dividing the city into a heavily built-up western section and the largely agricultural eastern section. Most of the city's schools, government institutions, commercial developments, industries, and other urban amenities are in this section. The largest contiguous built-up area is at Sapang Palay Resettlement Project area, followed by the conurbation in Tungkong Mangga and Muzon.

The developments east of the Quirino Highway are mostly scattered residential areas and agricultural lands. However, there are a few subdivisions that are some distance away from Ciudad Real and take advantage of its secluded and rural atmosphere. These are the Blessed Sacrament Seminary and an Augustinian convent.

In between the built-up clusters are pockets of agricultural lands, which are continuously converted into built-up uses. Planted in these lands are crops such as [[rice]] and [[maize|corn]]. The clustering pattern for both built-up and agricultural uses is partly due to the decisions made by settlers about the hilly conditions that dominate the topography. Most households in the western half of San Jose del Monte opted to convert their lands to residential uses while others maintained the farms. This left upland uses, such as those about forest use, more common towards the easternmost zones.

Most vegetative outgrowths are in areas that are difficult to build on. But there are instances when these outgrowths are integrated into the built-up areas, usually found in the West: several heavily vegetated areas. Supplementing these are mini forest projects of the city government. The City Agriculture Office maintains a {{convert|1.65|ha|adj=on}} Mini Forest Project in Barangay Muzon along the San Jose del Monte–Marilao Road and a mahogany planting site.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://csjdm.gov.ph/socioeconomic-and-physical-profile/geophysical-sector/|title=San Jose del Monte City Government (Land Use)|website=San Jose del Monte City|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022063107/http://csjdm.gov.ph/socioeconomic%2Dand%2Dphysical%2Dprofile/geophysical%2Dsector/|archive-date=October 22, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Barangays===
[[File:Ph fil san jose del monte.png|thumb|310px|upright=1.1|{{center|'''Political Map of San Jose del Monte'''<br>(prior to the split of Barangay Muzon in 2023)}}]]
San Jose del Monte is politically subdivided into 62 [[barangay]]s.<ref name="mznPDI">{{cite news |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1747808/plebiscite-under-way-to-divide-bulacans-largest-village/ |title=Plebiscite under way to divide Bulacan's largest village |work=[[Inquirer.net]] |date=March 25, 2023 |access-date=March 25, 2023 |archive-date=March 25, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230325070858/https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1747808/plebiscite-under-way-to-divide-bulacans-largest-village |url-status=live }}</ref> Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s and some have [[sitios]].

It is originally made up of only six barangays: Poblacion, Halang (Muzon), Sapang Palay, Minuyan, Santo Cristo, and Gaya-Gaya. Over time, these six mother barangays were divided to provide better accommodation for the people, particularly in the Sapang Palay Resettlement Area (Hacienda de Sapang Palay), which stretches to Minuyan.

There is an ongoing land dispute with the municipality of Norzagaray, Bulacan regarding both territories. Such disputes can be located in the upper portion of Assumption, the eastern portion of Santo Niño II, the eastern portion of San Martin de Porres, the eastern portion of Lawang Pari, the eastern portion of Minuyan Proper, Kaybanban, San Roque, Paradise III, San Isidro, the upper portion of Tungkong Mangga, the upper portion of Ciudad Real barangays in San Jose del Monte and lower portion of Tigbe, the lower portion of Bitungol, the lower portion of Minuyan, lower portion of Bigte, lower portion of San Mateo (Sitio Kaharume), mountainous portion of San Lorenzo barangays in Norzagaray.

Historical maps of Bulacan, before the creation of Doña Remedios Trinidad, indicate that ''both territories'' of San Jose del Monte and Norzagaray stretch up to [[Tayabas province]].

These barangays are grouped into two districts, the first with a Postal/ZIP Code of 3023, and the second with 3024. Twenty-six (26) barangays comprise the first district while the 36 barangays located in Sapang Palay 36 compose the second district.

The city's administrative center is located in Poblacion 1, home to the city's major government and non-government services. Dulong Bayan, on the other hand, is set to become the city's new seat of government, with the new government center being erected there. San Jose del Monte has 4 major urban centers, called nodes: Muzon node (consisting of the four barangays of Muzon), Poblacion node (consisting of the two barangays of Poblacion), Sapang Palay node (consisting of the barangays surrounding Sampol Market), and Tungkong Mangga node.

The most recently created barangays are Muzon Proper, Muzon East, Muzon West, and Muzon South created by dividing Barangay Muzon.<ref>{{cite PH act |chamber=RA |number=11896 |url=https://legacy.senate.gov.ph/republic_acts/ra%2011896.pdf |title=An Act Dividing Barangay Muzon in the City of San Jose Del Monte, Province of Bulacan Into Four (4) Separate and Independent Barangays to Be Known as Barangay Muzon Proper, Barangay Muzon East, Barangay Muzon West and Barangay Muzon South |date=July 1, 2022 |website=[[Senate of the Philippines]] |publisher=[[Government of the Philippines]] |access-date=March 18, 2023 |archive-date=March 18, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230318152938/https://legacy.senate.gov.ph/republic_acts/ra%2011896.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> The four barangays were made through the approval of a law on March 25, 2023 through a referendum.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1193026 |title=Plebiscite for division of Bulacan village set March 25 |work=[[Philippine News Agency]] |date=January 18, 2023 |access-date=July 28, 2023 |first=Ferdinand |last=Patinio |archive-date=March 18, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230318152940/https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1193026 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the 2020 census, the population of San Jose del Monte was 651,813 people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|651,813/105.53|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or|sp=us}}. This makes it the largest local government unit in Bulacan province. It is also the largest city in Central Luzon (Region III).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://psa.gov.ph/content/population-region-iii-central-luzon-based-2015-census-population|title=Population of Region III - Central Luzon (Based on the 2015 Census of Population)|date=June 1, 2016|website=Philippine Statistics Authority|access-date=August 31, 2017|archive-date=September 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915221425/http://psa.gov.ph/content/population-region-iii-central-luzon-based-2015-census-population|url-status=live}}</ref>

With the coming of settlers to San Jose del Monte, its population increased tremendously. Its population increased dramatically since the 1950s as the population tended to move from rural areas to towns and cities. Its proximity to Manila allowed it to accommodate its spillover population. This is further hastened by the development of nearby [[Quezon City]] and the accompanying increase in population and infrastructure.

The forced relocation of informal settlers and the lure of government to provide them with their own homes allowed the town to continue to grow despite the lack of government facilities. As such, San Jose del Monte exhibited an increasing percentage share of the provincial population from as low as 2% in 1960 to 9% in 1990 and then to 17% in 2015. The town surpassed the population of [[Meycauayan]] in the 1980 census and [[Malolos]] in the 1990 census, then the largest towns of Bulacan. By 2015, it has more than two times the population of the now second place [[Santa Maria, Bulacan|Santa Maria]] town (256,454 people in the 2015 Census).

If current population growth holds (2010-2015, +4.55%), the population of San Jose del Monte is expected to double and breach one million by the 2030 Census.
