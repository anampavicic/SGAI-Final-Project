''Santo Tomas'' was so named after [[Thomas of Villanova|Saint Thomas]], the patron saint of [[Danao, Cebu|Danao]] which is the hometown of then Governor of undivided [[Davao (former province)|Davao Province]] [[Vicente Duterte]], father of the 16th Philippine president [[Rodrigo Duterte]].

==History==
What is now Santo Tomas, initially called Tibal-og, was once part of the jurisdiction of nearby town of [[Kapalong, Davao del Norte|Kapalong]]. Before the 1950s. the place used to be a lush forest inhabited by the indigenous [[Aeta|Ata]]-[[Manobo]] people.

According to the town's pioneering residents, the area of what is now Kapalong (in which what is now Santo Tomas was still part of) and [[Panabo|Panabo City]] were planted for [[abaca]] during the pre-war years.

'''Santo Tomas''' was established as a municipality through ''[[Executive order (Philippines)|Executive Order]] No. 352'', issued by [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Carlos P. Garcia]] on August 14, 1959. It consists of Barrio Tibal-og, designated as the seat of government, and "other ''[[barrio]]s'' or ''[[sitio]]s''" of [[Kapalong]], and four ''barrios'' of [[Panabo]], all then part of the [[Davao (province)|old Davao province]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1959/08/14/executive-order-no-352-s-1959/ |title=Executive Order No. 352, s. 1959 |date=August 14, 1959 |website=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)]] |publisher=[[Government of the Philippines]] |access-date=28 September 2021}}</ref>
