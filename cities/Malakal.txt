== History ==
Historically, Malakal was known as the former Sobat District. The Malakal town started as a tiny District administrative unit which later expanded into a big town becoming the capital city of the Upper Nile State (since 2020). It was also the capital of the defunct Eastern Nile State and Central Upper Nile State During the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]], the town was a [[Garrison|garrison town]] of the [[Khartoum|Khartoum-based]] [[Sudanese Armed Forces]] (SAF). Following South Sudan's [[independence]] on 9 July 2011, the troops from the [[Republic of Sudan]] have retreated from Malakal. Malakal was the site of the November 2006 [[Battle of Malakal]].

Beginning in 2013, Malakal has been the site of numerous battles between government [[Sudan People's Liberation Army|SPLA]] forces and the [[Nuer White Army]], loosely commanded by the [[Sudan Peoples Liberation Movement-in-Opposition|SPLM-IO]] which is headed by [[Riek Machar]].  The city has been overrun on various occasions by both sides.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303802104579450590896596338 |title=South Sudan Troops Recapture Malakal From Rebels - News |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=2014-03-20 |access-date=2014-05-24}}</ref> As of October 2015, Malakal had exchanged hands twelve times during the civil war, and was utterly destroyed in the process.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Franks|first1=Tim|title=Malakal: The city that vanished in South Sudan|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-34571435|access-date=24 November 2015|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=24 October 2015}}</ref>

==Transportation==
A major road linking Malakal with the town of [[Kurmuk]] at the border with [[Ethiopia]] is under repairs and renovations to [[Asphalt concrete|asphalt]] surface. The road is expected to be ready for commissioning by May 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/Contractors+rush+for+South+Sudan+contracts/-/2558/1202496/-/item/0/-/d2mtx6z/-/index.html |title=Contractors rush for South Sudan contracts - News |publisher=Theeastafrican.co.ke |date=2013-09-21 |access-date=2014-02-15}}</ref>
The city of Malakal is also served by [[Malakal Airport|Malakal International Airport]], one of the two International airports in [[South Sudan]], the other being [[Juba Airport|Juba International Airport]].
