'''Maseru''' is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] and largest city of [[Lesotho]]. It is also the capital of the [[Maseru District]]. Located on the [[Caledon River]], Maseru lies directly on the [[Lesotho–South Africa border]]. Maseru had a population of 330,760 in the 2016 census. The city was established as a police camp and assigned as the capital after the country became a [[British protectorate]] in 1869. When the country achieved independence in 1966, Maseru retained its status as capital. The name of the city is a [[Sesotho]] word meaning "red sandstones".<ref name="cities">{{cite journal|title=City profile: Maseru, Lesotho|author1=Sam Romaya |author2=Alison Brown |journal=Cities|issue=2|volume=16|date=April 1999|pages=123–133|doi=10.1016/S0264-2751(98)00046-8}}</ref><ref name="dict">{{cite book|title=Southern Sotho English Dictionary|author1=A.

==History==
Maseru was founded by the [[British Empire|British]] as a small police camp in 1869, following the conclusion of the [[Free State–Basotho War]]s when [[Basutoland]] became a British protectorate.<ref>Britannica,[https://www.britannica.com/place/Maseru Maseru], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref><ref name="ankomah">{{cite journal|title=Lesotho: Africa's Best Kept Secret|author1=Baffour Ankomah |author2=Khalid Bazid |journal=New African|date=May 2003}}</ref><ref name="hansenvaa">{{cite book |author1=Karen Tranberg Hansen |url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn%3Anbn%3Ase%3Anai%3Adiva-103 |title=Reconsidering Informality: Perspectives from Urban Africa |author2=Mariken Vaa |publisher=Nordic African Institute |year=2004 |isbn=91-7106-518-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/reconsideringinf00hans/page/n179 180] |url-access=limited}}</ref> Maseru is located at the edge of the "conquered territories" relinquished to the [[Orange Free State]] (now the [[Free State (province)|Free State]] province of South Africa) as part of the peace terms. It was located {{convert|24|km|mi}} west of [[Basotho]] King [[Moshoeshoe I]]'s stronghold of [[Thaba Bosiu]], the previous ''de facto'' capital. A bustling market town soon grew around the area.<ref name="olivier">{{cite book|title=Touring in South Africa: The Great SA Road Trip Guide|author1=Willie Olivier |author2=Sandra Olivier |year=2005|publisher=Struik|pages=116|isbn=1-77007-142-3}}</ref>

Maseru initially functioned as the state's administrative capital between 1869 and 1871, before administration of Basutoland was transferred to the [[Cape Colony]]. During their rule between 1871 and 1884, Basutoland was treated similarly to territories that had been forcefully annexed, much to the chagrin of the [[Basotho]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire|editor-last1=Olson|editor-first1=James S.|editor-last2=Shadle|editor-first2=Robert S.|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1996|pages=118|isbn=0-313-27917-9}}</ref> This led to the [[Gun War]] in 1881 and the burning of many buildings in Maseru.<ref name="cities" /> In 1884, Basutoland was restored to its status as a [[Crown colony]], and Maseru was again made capital. When Basutoland gained its independence and became the Kingdom of Lesotho in 1966, Maseru remained the country's capital.<ref name="hansenvaa" />

Prior to Lesotho's independence, Maseru had remained relatively small; it was contained within well-defined colonial boundaries and had little room for growth, while the British had little interest in developing the city. After 1966 Maseru experienced rapid expansion: its area increased around sevenfold, from around {{convert|20|km2|sqmi}} to the current area of {{convert|138|km2|sqmi}}, due to incorporation of nearby peri-urban villages to the city proper.<ref name="cities" /><ref name="hansenvaa" /> The annual population growth rates remained around 7% for several decades, before tapering off to around 3.5% between 1986 and 1996.<ref name="hansenvaa" />

After the [[1998 Lesotho general election|1998 parliamentary elections]] in Lesotho led to suspicions of vote fraud and a [[South African intervention in Lesotho|military intervention by South Africa]], much of the city was damaged by riots and pillaging.<ref>{{cite news|title=It All Went Wrong|newspaper=The Economist|volume=349|issue=8087|date=September 26, 1998|pages=49}}</ref>  The cost of repairing the damage done to the city was estimated at two billion [[South African rand|rand]] (US$350 million),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/190136.stm|title=Lesotho billed for South African intervention|work=BBC News|date=1998-10-09|access-date=2008-04-14}}</ref> and until almost 2008, the effects of the riots could still be seen within the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mg.co.za/articledirect.aspx?area=onlineletters_archive&ArticleId=303580|title=Straw men|work=Mail & Guardian Online|date=2007-03-15|access-date=2008-04-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603160855/http://www.mg.co.za/articledirect.aspx?area=onlineletters_archive&ArticleId=303580|archive-date=2012-06-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Maseru Panorama 1-2007.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Panoramic view of Maseru in 2007]]
Maseru is located in northwest Lesotho by the [[South Africa]]n border, denoted by the [[Mohokare River]],  also known as Caledon River. The two countries are connected by a border post at the Maseru Bridge, which crosses the river. On the South African side, [[Ladybrand]] is the town closest to Maseru. The city lies in a shallow valley at the foot of the Hlabeng-Sa-Likhama, foothills of the [[Maloti Mountains]].<ref name="cities" /> The elevation of the city is listed as {{convert|1600|m|ft}} above sea level.<ref>{{cite book|title=South Africa, Lesotho & Swaziland|author1=Mary Fitzpatrick |author2=Becca Blond |author3=Gemma Pitcher |author4=Simon Richmond |author5=Matt Warren |year=2004|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=1-74104-162-7 |pages=521}}</ref> The city has an area of around {{convert|138|km2|sqmi}}.<ref name="hansenvaa" />

==Demographics==
The latest (2016) census lists the city's population at 330,760, or around a tenth of the entire population of the country, and half of the total urban population. The population of the city was at 98,017 by the 1986 census, and 137,837 by the 1996 census, demonstrating the early rapid expansion of the city after independence.<ref name="cities" />

[[File:362 Kingsway.jpg|thumb|Kingsway traffic]]

==Transport==
[[File:Maseru Leotho main south.jpg|thumb|View from the main road south in Maseru]]
[[Maseru branch line|A railway line]], built in 1905, bridges the Mohokare River to connect Maseru with [[Marseilles, Free State|Marseilles]] on South Africa's [[Bloemfontein]]&ndash;[[Bethlehem, Free State|Bethlehem]] main line.

Kingsway, the road joining the former [[Leabua Jonathan]] Airport, now [[Mejametalana Airport]] and the Royal Palace in Maseru, was the first paved road in Lesotho. Having previously been just a dirt path, it was renovated in 1947 for the visit of members of the [[British Royal Family]].<ref>Fitzpatrick et al. 2004, p. 522</ref> It remained the only paved road in the country until Lesotho's independence in 1966.<ref name="cities" /> Two main roads lead outside of Maseru, Main North 1 to the northeast and Main South 1 to the southeast toward [[Mazenod, Lesotho|Mazenod]] and [[Roma, Lesotho|Roma]]. The South African [[N8 (South Africa)|N8]] road leads from the Maseru Bridge border post west towards [[Ladybrand]] and [[Bloemfontein]].

An international airport called the [[Moshoeshoe I International Airport]] is nearby, at Thoteng-ea-Moli, Mazenod. The [[National University of Lesotho]] is located in Roma, {{convert|32|km|mi}} from Maseru.

==Economy==
[[File:Uptown Maseru.jpg|thumb|View from Main North 1, uptown Maseru at dusk]]
The commerce in the city is centred on two neighbouring [[central business district]]s, which have developed around Kingsway and serve as major employment centres. The western business district holds larger office buildings, department stores and several banks. The eastern business district hosts mainly smaller businesses, markets and street vendors.<ref name="cities" /> The central business districts are the largest employment centres within the city.<ref name="cities" />

Maseru's economy is one that is growing at a very rapid speed,<ref>{{Cite web |title=New report reveals Maseru generates half of Lesotho's GDP {{!}} United Nations Economic Commission for Africa |url=https://www.uneca.org/stories/new-report-reveals-maseru-generates-half-of-lesotho%E2%80%99s-gdp |access-date=2024-06-22 |website=www.uneca.org}}</ref> which is notable particularly in terms of foreign investment and tourism since independence from Britain, and economic ruin when political violence broke out in 1998. Since the riots, the city has worked hard to undo the damage caused.

Maseru's industry is split into two main areas. The one to the north of the central business districts along Moshoeshoe Road holds flour mills and other major companies. The other industrial sector lies to the south of the central business districts, at the Thetsane district, and houses mainly textile and footwear companies.<ref name="cities" />

Up until 2004 Maseru had a growing textile industry supported by and invested in by Chinese manufacturing concerns. Since the expiration of the [[Multi Fibre Arrangement]] the textile industry in Lesotho has diminished.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Lesotho: The Promise of Africa|author=Peete Monolapo|journal=Foreign Policy|issue= 162|date=September–October 2007}}</ref> The city's products once included [[candle]]s, [[carpet]]s and mohair products but these have been overshadowed by South African industries.

== Places of worship ==   
Most [[places of worship]] in the city are [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and temples, including churches of the [[Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa]], [[Zion Christian Church]], [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa]], and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Maseru]] (including its cathedral, [[Our Lady of Victories Cathedral, Maseru|Our Lady of Victories Cathedral]]).<ref>Britannica,
[https://www.britannica.com/place/Lesotho Lesotho], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref> There are also [[Islam|Muslim]] mosques.

==Architecture==
[[File:Maseru night.jpg|thumb|right|Maseru at night—view to the south. The city centre is to the right]]
[[File:BasothoHatShop.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Basotho Hat Shop]]
Most of the traditional thatched-roof mud-brick houses, called [[rondavel]]s, have been replaced with modern housing and office blocks which have a tint of traditional architecture.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} There have recently{{when|date=December 2022}} been some new buildings in the centre of the city, particularly the building across LNDC centre which now houses Good times cafe, a Vodacom shop, offices and the new building of the Ministry of Health which was completed in late 2007.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

Buildings destroyed in the [[Southern African Development Community intervention in Lesotho|1998 political uprising]] have been rebuilt and have shops like Fruits and Veg City, Woolworths and Mr Price to name a few. The New Lehakoe National sports centre, which is in between the central Bank of Lesotho and the colonial parliament building is equipped with tennis courts, swimming pools, conference centres, bars and gymnasiums. In November 2009, Pioneer Mall opened, providing Maseru with a South African style shopping mall, with many stores,such as a four-screen cinema-which later closed- and restaurants. Pioneer Mall opened way for more modern buildings in the city, the likes of Maseru mall and City Square centre

There are some colonial era buildings around the centre of the city, most notably the [[Our Lady of Victories Cathedral, Maseru|Cathedral of Our Lady of Victories]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Maseru]], and the Anglican St. John's Church.<ref name="cities" /> Other sights include the Royal Palace, the [[Parliament of Lesotho|Parliament]] building and the State House.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sadc.int/summit/2006/host/index.php|title=SADC Summit 2006|work=Southern African Development Community|access-date=2008-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114210431/http://www.sadc.int/summit/2006/host/index.php|archive-date=2007-11-14|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Sports==
Lesotho's [[national stadium]], the multi-purpose [[Setsoto Stadium]], is located in Maseru. It has a capacity of between 20,000 and 25,000 people. The stadium is mostly used for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and houses the [[Lesotho national football team]], but also holds events in [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lesotho.gov.ls/articles/2007/SETSOTO_STADIUM_REVAMPED.php |title=Setsoto Stadium to Be Revamped |work=Lesotho Ministry of Communications, Science and Technology |access-date=2008-04-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828020402/http://www.lesotho.gov.ls/articles/2007/SETSOTO_STADIUM_REVAMPED.php |archive-date=2008-08-28 }}</ref>

12 out of 16 of the teams playing in the [[Lesotho Premier League]] reside in Maseru.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lefa.org.ls/LEFA_files/Teams.htm|title=Lesotho Teams|work=Lesotho Football Association|access-date=2008-04-13|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907234044/http://www.lefa.org.ls/LEFA_files/Teams.htm|archive-date=2008-09-07}}</ref> {{As of|2020}}, 36 out of the 51 championships contested in the league have gone to Maseru-based teams. Most successful of these have been [[Matlama FC]] with ten championship wins and the football team of the [[Royal Lesotho Defence Force]], with eight championship wins.
