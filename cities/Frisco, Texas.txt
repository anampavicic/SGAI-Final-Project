'''Frisco''' is a city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]], located in [[Collin County, Texas|Collin]] and [[Denton County, Texas|Denton]] counties. It is part of the [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex]] (DFW) and about {{convert|25|mi}} from both [[Dallas Love Field]] and [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]]. Its population was 200,509 in the [[2020 United States census|2020 U.S. census]].<ref name="2020 Census (City)">{{cite web|title=2020 Census Redistricting Data (Public Law 94-171) Summary File |url=https://data.census.gov/cedsci/profile?g=1600000US4827684 |work=American FactFinder |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=May 3, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=2020 Census |url=https://www.friscotexas.gov/1571/2020-Census |work=Frisco |access-date=May 3, 2022}}</ref>

In the late 1990s, the northern DFW suburban development tide hit the northern border of [[Plano, Texas|Plano]] and spilled into Frisco, sparking rapid growth into the 2000s. Like many of the cities in Dallas's northern exurbs, Frisco serves as a [[bedroom community]] for professionals who work in DFW. Since 2003, Frisco has received the designation [[Tree City USA]] from the [[National Arbor Day Foundation]].

The United States Census Bureau defines an [[urban area]] of northern Dallas-area suburbs that are separated from the Dallas–Fort Worth urban area, with [[McKinney, Texas|McKinney]] and Frisco as the principal cities: the McKinney–Frisco, Texas, urban area had a population of 504,803 as of the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]], ranked [[List of United States urban areas|83rd in the United States]].<ref name="urban area" />

==History==
When the Dallas area was being settled by American pioneers, many of the settlers traveled by [[wagon train]]s along the [[Texas Road|Shawnee Trail]]. This trail became the [[Preston Trail]], and later [[Texas State Highway 289|Preston Road]]. With all this activity, the community of [[Lebanon, Texas|Lebanon]] was founded along this trail and was granted a U.S. post office in 1860.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bonar|first=Eric|date=August 29, 2010|title=Lebanon Baptist Church|url=http://www.friscoheritage.org/heritage-center/lebanon-baptist-church/|access-date=December 4, 2021|website=Heritage Association of Frisco, Inc|language=en}}</ref>

In 1902, a line of the [[St. Louis–San Francisco Railway]] ("the Frisco") was being built through the area, and periodic watering stops were needed along the route for the steam locomotives. The current settlement of Lebanon was on Preston Ridge and was too high in elevation, so the watering stop was placed about 4 miles (6&nbsp;km) to the west on lower ground. A community grew around this train stop, and some Lebanon residents moved their houses to the new community on logs.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Discover The History Of Frisco, Texas|url=https://www.visitfrisco.com/plan-your-visit/history/|access-date=December 4, 2021|website=www.visitfrisco.com}}</ref> The new town was originally named Emerson, but the [[U.S. Postal Service]] rejected the name as too similar to another community, Emberson, in [[Lamar County, Texas|Lamar County]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=TSHA {{!}} Frisco, TX|url=https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/frisco-tx|access-date=December 4, 2021|website=www.tshaonline.org}}</ref>

In 1904, the town's residents chose "Frisco City" in honor of the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway. This name was later shortened to Frisco.<ref name=":1" />

==Geography==

==Economy==
[[File:Stonebriar-7231.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of Stonebriar Centre]]
Frisco has many retail properties, including [[Stonebriar Centre]], a 165-store [[regional mall]]; [[IKEA]], a furniture store with an area of {{convert|28800|m2|sqft|-2|abbr=on}}; and The Star, the headquarters of the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. Retail establishments and restaurants line Preston Road, one of the city's major north–south traffic arteries.

Frisco took a different economic track than many surrounding cities, electing to use a fractional percent of local sales tax to fund the Frisco Economic Development Corporation (FEDC) rather than [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]] (DART), the regional transportation body. The effectiveness of the FEDC, whose primary purpose is to reallocate such tax dollars to commercial ventures, is a matter of public debate.

Frisco Square, a [[mixed-use development]], became the new downtown along with the city hall. Frisco Square has about 250 rental residential units, seven restaurants, about {{convert|40000|sqft|m2}} of commercial office space, and a few personal-service locations. The major development in the project is the new city hall, main library, and public commons. A [[Cinemark]] theater opened in 2010. In 2012, a hospital, Medical City Plano-Frisco, was built north of the theater.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planostar.com/articles/2010/06/15/frisco_enterprise/news/474.txt|title=Star Local|access-date=June 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725135311/http://www.planostar.com/articles/2010/06/15/frisco_enterprise/news/474.txt|archive-date=July 25, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>
