The [[krai]] encompasses the central part of the [[Fore-Caucasus]] and most of the northern slopes of [[Caucasus Major]]. It borders with [[Rostov Oblast]], [[Krasnodar Krai]], [[Kalmykia]], [[Dagestan]], [[Chechnya]], [[North Ossetia–Alania]], [[Kabardino-Balkaria]], and [[Karachay–Cherkessia]].

===Climate===

Most of Stavropol Krai experiences [[hot-summer humid continental climate]] (except for mountains). Winters are shorter and warmer than in most of Russia but still freezing and snowy: average January temperature is between {{convert|-2|C}} and {{convert|-6|C}}. Summers are warm to hot with average July temperature of {{convert|20|C}} to {{convert|25|C}}. Extremes range from {{convert|-35|C}} in winter to {{convert|40|C}} in summer. Average annual precipitation is {{convert|400|to|600|mm|in}}.

==History==
The krai was established as [[North Caucasus Krai]] on October&nbsp;17, 1924. After undergoing numerous administrative changes, it was renamed Ordzhonikidze Krai ({{lang|ru|Орджоникидзевский край}}), after [[Sergo Ordzhonikidze]], in March 1937, and Stavropol Krai on January&nbsp;12, 1943.

==Politics==
During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the region (''krai'') was shared between three persons: the First Secretary of the Stavropol Krai CPSU Committee (who in reality had the greatest authority), the Chairman of the Krai Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the Krai Executive Committee (executive power).

In 1970–1978, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], a native of Stavropol Krai, occupied the position of the First Secretary of the Krai's Communist Party Committee. He left the region for Moscow in 1978, when he was promoted to a Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, to become the Party's General Secretary and the nation's leader 7 years later. The region was also native to [[Yuri Andropov]], who was also leader of the Soviet Union for a short time.

Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Krai Administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside the elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

The Charter of Stavropol Krai is the fundamental law of the region. The [[Legislative Assembly of Stavropol Krai]] is the province's [[regional parliaments of Russia|regional]] standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Krai Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day-to-day matters of the province. The krai administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as a guarantor of the observance of the krai Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].

==Economy==
Large companies in the region include [[Stavrolen]], [[Arnest]], [[Concern Enorgomera]], [[Nevinomiskiy Azot]], [[Stavropolskiy Gres]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Stavropol Territory Industries |url=https://www.investinregions.ru/en/regions/stavropol/industries/ |website=investinregions.ru |access-date=7 November 2018 }}</ref>

===Agriculture===
Irrigated agriculture is well-developed in the region. As of the beginning of 2001, Stavropol Krai had 3,361&nbsp;km of [[irrigation canal]]s, of which 959&nbsp;km were lined (i.e., had concrete or stone walls, rather than merely soil walls, to reduce the loss of water).<ref name=water>[http://mpr.stavkray.ru/natres/water/info.htm Общая информация О водных ресурсах края] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203102044/http://mpr.stavkray.ru/natres/water/info.htm |date=December 3, 2013 }} (General information about the water resources of the ''krai''), from the regional government site. {{in lang|ru}}</ref>

Among the major irrigation canals are:<ref name=water/>
*[[Nevinnomyssk Canal]] (Невинномысский канал), the trunk of the [[Kuban River|Kuban]]–[[Yegorlyk River|Yegorlyk]] Irrigation System.
*The [[Great Stavropol Canal]] (Большой Ставропольский канал), transporting water from the [[Kuban River]] eastward across the entire krai.
*The [[Terek-Kuma Canal]] and [[Kuma–Manych Canal]], transporting water from the [[Terek River]] via the [[Kuma River (Russia)|Kuma River]] to the [[Manych River|East Manych River]].

== Demographics ==
[[File:Life expectancy in Russian subject -Stavropol Krai.png|thumb|300px|Life expectancy at birth in Stavropol Krai]]According to the [[Russian Census (2021)|2021 Census]] the Krai's population was 2,907,593,<ref name="2021Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2021Census}}</ref> up from 2,786,281 in the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Census]]<ref name="2010Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2010Census}}</ref> and further up from&nbsp;2,410,379 recorded in the [[Soviet Census (1989)|1989 Census]].<ref name="1989Census">{{ru-pop-ref|1989Census}}</ref> The population of the krai is concentrated in the drainage basins of the [[Kuban River]] and of the [[Kuma River (Russia)|Kuma River]], which used to be traditional [[Cossack]] land (see ''[[History of Cossacks]]''). In modern Russia the [[Kuban Cossacks]] are now generally considered ethnic [[Russians]], although their roots are in Ukraine (historically, their [[Balachka|dialect]] was descended from that of [[Cherkasy]]). Other notable ethnic groups include  [[Armenians]] (mostly Christian [[Hamsheni]]), [[Armeno-Tat]]s, [[Pontic Greeks]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Turkmens]] as well as indigenous groups from the [[North Caucasian Federal District|North Caucasian republics]], especially from [[Chechnya]], [[Ingushetia]] and [[Dagestan]].
