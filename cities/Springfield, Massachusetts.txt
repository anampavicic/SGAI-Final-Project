Springfield was founded in 1636 by English Puritan [[William Pynchon]] as "Agawam Plantation" under the administration of the [[Connecticut Colony]]. In 1641 it was renamed after Pynchon's hometown of [[Springfield, Essex]], England, following incidents, including trade disputes as well as [[John Mason (c. 1600â€“1672)|Captain John Mason's]] hostilities toward native tribes, which precipitated the settlement's joining the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].<ref>Barrows, Charles Henry (1911).

During that attack, three-quarters of the original settlement was burned to the ground, with many of Springfield's residents survived by taking refuge in John Pynchon's brick house, the "Old Fort", the first such house to be built in the Connecticut River Valley. Out of the siege, [[Miles Morgan]] and his sons were lauded as heroes; as one of the few homesteads to survive the attack, alerting troops in Hadley, as well as Toto, often referred to as the "Windsor Indian" who, running 20 miles from [[Windsor, Connecticut]], to the settlement, was able to give advance warning of the attack.<ref name=King9>{{cite book | last = King | first = Moses | author-link = Moses King | title = King's Handbook of Springfield, Massachusetts | publisher = Franklin Press | year = 1885 | page = 9 | isbn = 9781152362826}}</ref>

The original settlementâ€”today's downtown Springfieldâ€”was located atop bluffs at the confluence of four rivers, at the nexus of trade routes to [[Boston]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[New York City]], and [[Montreal]], and with some of the northeastern United States' most fertile soil.<ref name="worldcat">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/servlet/org.oclc.lac.ui.DialABookServlet?oclcnum=61302153 |title=Find in a Library: The Encyclopedia of New England |publisher=worldcat.org |access-date=October 16, 2014 |archive-date=October 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017173537/http://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/servlet/org.oclc.lac.ui.DialABookServlet?oclcnum=61302153 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Post-colonial period ===
In 1777, Springfield's location at numerous crossroads led [[George Washington]] and [[Henry Knox]] to establish the United States' [[Springfield Armory|National Armory at Springfield]], which produced the first American [[musket]] in 1794, and later the famous [[Springfield rifle]].<ref name="springfield375.org">{{cite web|url=http://springfield375.org/?p=126 |title=Firsts &#124; Springfield 375 |publisher=Springfield375.org |access-date=April 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521154926/http://springfield375.org/?p=126 |archive-date=May 21, 2013 }}</ref> From 1777 until its closing during the [[Vietnam War]], the Springfield Armory attracted skilled laborers to Springfield, making it the United States' longtime center for precision manufacturing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.springfieldmuseums.org/news/view/375-new_museum_of_springfield_history_to_open_october_10 |title=New Museum of Springfield History to Open October 10â€”News |publisher=Springfield Museums |date=September 24, 2009 |access-date=April 4, 2012 |archive-date=June 5, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605113252/http://www.springfieldmuseums.org/news/view/375-new_museum_of_springfield_history_to_open_october_10 |url-status=live }}</ref> The near-capture of the armory during [[Shays' Rebellion]] of 1787 led directly to the formation of the [[U.S. Constitutional Convention]].

During the 19th and 20th centuries, Springfielders produced many innovations, including the first American-English dictionary (1805, [[Merriam-Webster]]); the first use of [[interchangeable parts]] and the [[assembly line]] in manufacturing (1819, [[Thomas Blanchard (inventor)|Thomas Blanchard]]); the first American horseless car (1825, Thomas Blanchard); the mass production of [[vulcanized rubber]] (1844, [[Charles Goodyear]]); the first American gasoline-powered car (1893, [[Duryea Brothers]]); the first successful motorcycle company (1901, "[[Indian (motorcycle)|Indian]]"); one of America's first commercial radio stations (1921, [[WBZ (AM)|WBZ]], broadcast from the [[Hotel Kimball]]); and most famously, the world's second-most-popular sport, [[basketball]] (1891, Dr. [[James Naismith]]).<ref name="springfield375.org" /> Springfield would play major roles in machine production, initially driven by the arms industry of the Armory, as well as from private companies such as [[Smith & Wesson]], established by [[Horace Smith (inventor)|Horace Smith]] and [[Daniel B. Wesson]]. Similarly, the industrial economy led Thomas and Charles Wason to establish the [[Wason Manufacturing Company]], which produced the first manufactured [[sleeping car]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Bianculli |first=Anthony J. |title=Trains and Technology: the American Railroad in the Nineteenth Century.

Springfield underwent a protracted decline during the second half of the 20th century, due largely to the decommissioning of the Springfield Armory in 1969; poor city planning decisions, such as the location of the elevated [[Interstate 91|I-91]] along the city's [[Connecticut River]] front; and overall decline of industry throughout the [[northeastern United States]]. During the 1980s and 1990s, Springfield developed a national reputation for crime, political corruption, and cronyism. During the early 21st century, Springfield saw long-term revitalization projects and several large projects, including the $1&nbsp;billion [[Hartford Line|New Havenâ€“Hartfordâ€“Springfield intercity rail]];<ref name="nhhsrail">{{cite web |url=http://www.nhhsrail.com/ |title=New Havenâ€“Hartfordâ€“Springfield Rail Program |publisher=nhhsrail.com |access-date=October 16, 2014 |archive-date=October 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006032221/http://www.nhhsrail.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref> [[MGM Springfield|a $1&nbsp;billion MGM casino]].,<ref name="mgmspringfield">{{cite web |url=http://www.mgmspringfield.com/springfield/vision.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825001237/http://www.mgmspringfield.com/springfield/vision.aspx |archive-date=August 25, 2012 |url-status=dead |title=MGM Springfieldâ€”Our Vision |access-date=October 16, 2014 }}</ref><ref name="springfield-ma">{{cite web |url=http://www3.springfield-ma.gov/planning/328.0.html |title=Springfield Redevelopment Authority: Union Station |publisher=www3.springfield-ma.gov |access-date=October 16, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018200656/http://www3.springfield-ma.gov/planning/328.0.html |archive-date=October 18, 2014 }}</ref> and the $95 million redevelopment of Springfield Union Station.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.springfield-ma.gov/sra/union-station|title=Springfield Union Station: Springfield Redevelopment Authority|website=www.springfield-ma.gov}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.masslive.com/business-news/2017/03/union_station.html|title=Grand opening date set for Springfield's Union Station|first=Jim|last=Kinney|date=March 6, 2017|website=masslive}}</ref>  In December 2022, Springfield was designated by the National Park Service as an American World War II Heritage City,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/spar/learn/news/city-of-springfield-designated-an-american-world-war-ii-heritage-city-by-national-park-service.htm|title=City of Springfield Designated an American World War II Heritage City by National Park Service - Springfield Armory National Historic Site |website=U.S. National Park Service |date=December 6, 2022  |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240203224648/https://www.nps.gov/spar/learn/news/city-of-springfield-designated-an-american-world-war-ii-heritage-city-by-national-park-service.htm |archive-date= 2024-02-03 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.springfield-ma.gov/cos/news-story?tx_news_pi1%5Baction%5D=detail&tx_news_pi1%5Bcontroller%5D=News&tx_news_pi1%5Bnews%5D=16042&cHash=df98fa6c04cdd81241285cd99218c863|title=City of Springfield Designated an American World War II Heritage City by National Park Service|date=December 6, 2022|website=City of Springfield, MA}}</ref> the first in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and one of only 18 communities in the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1207/national-park-service-announces-new-american-world-war-ii-heritage-cities.htm|title=National Park Service announces new American World War II Heritage Cities - Office of Communications (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref>

Located in the fertile [[Connecticut River Valley]], surrounded by mountains, bluffs, and rolling hills in all cardinal directions, Springfield sits on the eastern bank of the Connecticut River, near its confluence with two major tributary riversâ€”the western [[Westfield River]], which flows into the [[Connecticut]] opposite Springfield's South End Bridge; and the eastern [[Chicopee River]], which flows into the Connecticut less than {{convert|0.5|mi|km|1|abbr=on}} north of Springfield, in the city of [[Chicopee, Massachusetts|Chicopee]] (which constituted one of Springfield's most populous neighborhoods until it separated and became an independent municipality in 1852).<ref name="Gardner">{{cite book|title=Springfield Present and Prospective: The City of Homes |author1=Tower, J.E. |author2=Gardner, E.C. |date=1905 |publisher=Pond & Campbell |url=https://archive.org/details/springfieldpres00gardgoog |page=[https://archive.org/details/springfieldpres00gardgoog/page/n198 86] |access-date=October 16, 2014}}</ref> The Connecticut state line is only {{convert|4|mi|0}} south of Springfield, beside the wealthy suburb of [[Longmeadow, Massachusetts|Longmeadow]], which itself separated from Springfield in 1783.<ref name="Gardner"/>

Springfield's densely urban [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]] district surrounding Main Street is relatively flat, and follows the northâ€“south trajectory of the Connecticut River; however, as one moves eastward, the city becomes increasingly hilly.

Aside from its rivers, Springfield's second most prominent topographical feature is the city's {{convert|735|acre|adj=on}} [[Forest Park, Springfield, Massachusetts|Forest Park]]. Forest Park lies in the southwestern corner of the city, surrounded by Springfield's attractive garden districts, Forest Park and [[Forest Park Heights Historic District|Forest Park Heights]], which feature over 600 Victorian [[Painted ladies|Painted Lady]] mansions. Forest Park also borders Longmeadow. Springfield shares borders with other suburbs such as [[East Longmeadow, Massachusetts|East Longmeadow]], [[Wilbraham, Massachusetts|Wilbraham]], [[Ludlow, Massachusetts|Ludlow]] and the city of Chicopee. The small cities of [[Agawam, Massachusetts|Agawam]] and [[West Springfield, Massachusetts|West Springfield]] lie less than a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) from Springfield's Metro Center, across the Connecticut River.

The City of Springfield also owns the Springfield Country Club, located in the autonomous city of West Springfield, which separated from Springfield in 1774.<ref name="Gardner"/>

Springfield, like other cities in southern New England, has a [[hot-summer humid continental climate]] ([[KÃ¶ppen climate classification|KÃ¶ppen]]: ''Dfa'') with four distinct seasons and precipitation evenly distributed throughout the year, but the intensity (and sometimes the duration) of warmer periods is greater than in northern areas. Winters are cold with a daily average in January of around {{convert|26|Â°F|C|0}}. During winter, [[nor'easter]] storms can drop significant snowfalls on Springfield and the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Temperatures below {{convert|0|Â°F|Â°C|0}} can occur each year, though the area does not experience the high snowfall amounts and blustery wind averages of nearby cities such as [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], and [[Albany, New York]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Springfield's summers are very warm and sometimes humid. During summer, several times per month, on hot days afternoon [[thunderstorms]] will develop when unstable warm air collides with approaching [[cold front]]s. The daily average in July is around {{convert|74|Â°F|C|0}}. Usually several days during the summer exceed {{convert|90|Â°F|Â°C|0}}, constituting a "[[heat wave]]". Spring and fall temperatures are usually pleasant, with mild days and crisp, cool nights. Precipitation averages {{convert|45.85|in|mm|0}} annually, and snowfall averages {{convert|40.5|in|cm|0}}, most of which falls from mid-December to early March. Although not unheard of, extreme weather events like [[hurricanes]] and [[tornado]]es occur infrequently in Springfield compared with other areas in the country. On the occasions that hurricanes have hit New England, Springfield's inland, upriver location has caused its damages to be considerably less than shoreline cities like [[New Haven, Connecticut]], and [[Providence, Rhode Island]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Springfield's vicinity to both [[Boston]] and [[New York City]] lends it a location well suited for distribution, and in the past this has played a significant role in its economy. For this reason in the early 20th century it was the largest producer in New England of commercially produced cakes and pastries, and among the largest in breadâ€”with one 1926 estimate of 1.4 million loaves of bread and 14 million breakfast rolls produced in the city on a weekly basis.<ref>{{cite news|title=Proposed Billion Dollar Bakeries Merger Vitally Concerns; Two Local Bakeries Already Linked Up with Big Combines|date=January 17, 1926|page=1|work=Springfield Sunday Republican|location=Springfield, Mass.}}</ref>

Today Springfield's top five industries (in order, by number of workers) are: Education and Health Services; Trade and Transportation; Manufacturing; Tourism and Hospitality; and Professional & Business Services.

Springfield is home to five distinct museums at the [[Quadrangle (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Quadrangle]], along with the ornate [[Springfield City Library]]â€”an architecturally significant example of the [[City Beautiful]] movement. The Quadrangle's five distinct collections include the [[Dr. Seuss Memorial|Dr. Seuss National Memorial Sculpture Garden]]; the largest collection of Chinese cloisonne outside of China; and the original casting of [[Augustus Saint Gaudens]]'s most famous sculpture, ''Puritan''.

The Quadrangle's five museums are the Museum of Fine Arts, which features a large [[Impressionist]] collection; the George Walter Vincent Smith Art Museum, a collection of Asian curiosities; the [[Springfield Science Museum]], which features a life-size Tyrannosaurus Rex, an aquarium and  the first American-made [[planetarium]], designed and built (1937) by Frank Korkosz; the [[Amazing World of Dr. Seuss Museum]], as Springfield is the birthplace of [[Dr. Seuss|Theodor Geisel]]; and the Lyman and Merrie Wood Museum of Springfield History, a museum about the multi-faceted city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.springfieldmuseums.org/the_museums/|title=The Museums|date=July 2015|publisher=Springfield Museums|access-date=April 26, 2011|archive-date=June 28, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628032833/http://www.springfieldmuseums.org/the_museums/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Connecticut Valley Historical Museum was one of the Quadrangle's five museums until 2009.

The [[Springfield Symphony Orchestra]] performs in [[Symphony Hall, Springfield|Springfield Symphony Hall]].

In 2011, Springfield's music scene was eclectic. It featured a notable heavy rock scene, from which the bands Gaiah, [[Staind]], [[All That Remains (band)|All That Remains]], [[Shadows Fall]], and [[The Acacia Strain]] rose to national prominence. Jazz and blues rival rock in popularity.

In 2010 and 2011 the Springfield-headquartered [[Hampden Bank]] sponsored the Hoops City Jazz & Art Festival, a three-day event that drew approximately 30,000 people to Metro Center to hear varieties of different jazz musicâ€”from smooth jazz, to hard bop, to New Orleans-style jazz. Headliners included Springfield great [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], the [[Average White Band]], and [[Poncho Sanchez]].

In addition to its nickname ''The City of Firsts'', Springfield is known as ''The City of Homes'' for its attractive architecture, which differentiates it from most medium-size, Northeastern American cities. Most of Springfield's housing stock consists of Victorian "[[Painted Ladies]]" (similar to those found in San Francisco); however, Springfield also features [[Gilded Age]] mansions, urban condominiums buildings, brick apartment blocks, and more suburban post-World War II architecture (in the Sixteen Acres and Pine Point neighborhoods). While Springfield's architecture is attractive, much of its built-environment stems from the 19th and early 20th centuries when the city experienced a period of "intense and concentrated prosperity"â€”today, its Victorian architecture can be found in various states of rehabilitation and disrepair. As of 2011, Springfield's housing prices are considerably lower than nearby New England cities which do not feature such intricate architecture.

In Metro Center, stands the two prominent skyscrapers, Tower Square, and [[Monarch Place]], the latter of which is the tallest building in Massachusetts outside of Boston. Many of the city's Victorian buildings including former hotels, factories, and other institutions have been converted into apartment buildings and luxury condominiums. For example, Springfield's ornate Classical High School (235 State Street), with its immense Victorian atriumâ€”where Dr. Seuss, Timothy Leary, and Taj Mahal all went to high schoolâ€”is now a luxury condominium building. The [[Hotel Kimball]], (140 Chestnut Street), which hosted several U.S. Presidents as guests and once featured the United States' first commercial radio station (WBZ), has been converted into The [[Kimball Towers Condominiums]].<ref name="hammondmuseumofradio.org">{{cite web|author=Paul Cassel|url=http://www.hammondmuseumofradio.org/wbz-dhalper.html|title=WBZ and WBZA in the 20s and 30s|publisher=Hammondmuseumofradio.org|access-date=June 10, 2011|archive-date=July 21, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721065410/http://www.hammondmuseumofradio.org/wbz-dhalper.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The former McIntosh Shoe Company (158 Chestnut Street), one of Springfield's finest examples of the [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago School of Architecture]], has been converted into industrial-style condominiums; and the red-brick, former Milton Bradley toy factory is now Stockbridge Court Apartments (45 Willow Street). In the Ridgewood Historic District, the 1950s-futurist Mulberry House (101 Mulberry Street), is now a condominium building that features some of the finest views of Springfield.

[[Forest Park, Springfield, Massachusetts|Forest Park (and Forest Park Heights)]], surrounding by the {{convert|735|acre|ha|1}} [[Forest Park (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Forest Park]], is a New England Garden District featuring more than 600 [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Painted Ladies]]. The [[McKnight, Springfield, Massachusetts (and Mason Square)|McKnight National Historic District]], America's first planned residential neighborhood, (1881), features more than 900 Victorian Painted Ladies, many of which have been rehabilitated by Springfield's growing [[LGBT]] community. The Old Hill, Upper Hill, and Bay neighborhoods also feature this type of architecture.

Maple High, which is architecturally (and geographically) distinct from, but often included with Springfield's economically depressed [[Six Corners]] neighborhood, was Springfield's first "Gold Coast". Many mansions from the early 19th century and later [[gilded age]] stand atop a bluff on Maple Street, overlooking the Connecticut River. The Ridgewood Historic district on Ridgewood and Mulberry Streets also feature historic mansions from the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Springfieldâ€”like many mid-size Northeastern cities, e.g., Hartford, [[Albany, New York|Albany]], and New Havenâ€”from the 1950s to the 1970s, razed a significant number of historic commercial buildings in the name of [[urban renewal]]. In 1961, this included Unity Church, the first building designed by the young [[Henry Hobson Richardson]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochsner |first1=Jeffrey Karl |author-link1=Jeffrey Karl Ochsner |title=H.H.

Current efforts are underway to improve the cohesion of Springfield's Metro Center, including the completed Main Street and State Street Corridor improvement projects, the upcoming $70&nbsp;million renovation to Springfield's 1926 Union Station and the renovation of the Epiphany Tower on State Street into a new hotel. New constructions include the architecturally award-winning, $57&nbsp;million [[Moshe Safdie]]-designed Federal Building on State Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/248.0.html |title=City of Springfield, Mass.: Alphabetical Project Update List |publisher=Springfieldcityhall.com |date=September 9, 2010 |access-date=May 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716123525/http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/248.0.html |archive-date=July 16, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

Besides Springfield's historic connection with basketball, the city has a rich sporting history. Volleyball was invented in the adjacent city of Holyoke, and the first exhibition match was held in 1896 at the [[Springfield College|International YMCA Training School]], now known as [[Springfield College]].

[[Ice hockey]] has been played professionally in Springfield since the 1920s, and Springfield is home to the league headquarters of the [[American Hockey League]]. The [[Springfield Indians]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (now located in [[Utica, New York]]) was the oldest minor league hockey franchise in existence. In [[1994â€“95 AHL season|1994]] the team relocated to Worcester and was replaced by the [[Springfield Falcons]], who played at the [[MassMutual Center]]. The Falcons were then replaced by the [[Springfield Thunderbirds]] in [[2016â€“17 AHL season|2016]]. For parts of two seasons (1978â€“1980) the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[Hartford Whalers]] played in Springfield while their arena was undergoing repairs after a roof collapse. On the amateur level, the Junior A [[Springfield Pics|Springfield Olympics]] played for many years at the Olympia, while [[American International College]]'s Yellow Jackets compete in [[NCAA]] Division I hockey.

Basketball remains a popular sport in Springfield's sporting landscape. Springfield is currently home to the Western Mass Zombies a minor league basketball team participating in the [[East Coast Basketball League]]. The Zombies in 2021 were named ECBL Mid-Atlantic Champions. Prior to the 2014â€“2015 season, Springfield was home to the [[Springfield Armor]] of the [[NBA Development League]], which began play in 2009 at the MassMutual Center. Beginning in the 2011â€“2012 season, the Armor was the exclusive affiliate of the [[Brooklyn Nets]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/dleague/springfield/name_logo_090630.html |title=Springfield's NBA Development League Team Unveils Name and Logo |publisher=NBA |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703184421/http://www.nba.com/dleague/springfield/name_logo_090630.html |archive-date=July 3, 2009 }}</ref> For many years, the Hall of Fame Tip-Off Classic has been the semi-official start to the college basketball season, and the NCAA Division II championships are usually held in Springfield.

Springfield has had professional baseball in the past. The [[Springfield Giants]] of the Single- and Double-A [[Eastern League (1938â€“2020)|Eastern League]] played between 1957 and 1965. The team was quite successful, winning consecutive championships in 1959, 1960 and 1961, by startling coincidence the same seasons in which the Springfield Indians won three straight [[Calder Cup]] championships in hockey. The Giants played at Pynchon Park by the Connecticut River until relocating after the 1965 season. Pynchon Park's grandstands were destroyed by fire the year after in 1966.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.projectballpark.org/history/na/alt/pynchon.html |title=Pynchon Park |publisher=Projectballpark.org |date=September 11, 1966 |access-date=August 1, 2009 |archive-date=September 19, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919163020/http://www.projectballpark.org/history/na/alt/pynchon.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Before that time, the [[Springfield Cubs]] played in the minor league [[New England League]] from 1946 until 1949, after which the league folded; they then played in the [[International League]] until 1953. For many years before the Giants, Springfield was also a member of the Eastern League, between 1893 and 1943. In general, the team was named the [[Springfield Ponies|Ponies]], but it also carried the nicknames of "Maroons" (1895), "Green Sox" (1917), "Hampdens" (1920â€“1921), "Rifles (1932, 1942â€“1943) and "Nationals" (1939â€“1941). The team located closest are the Valley Blue Sox of the New England Collegiate Baseball League who play their games in nearby Holyoke, but house their team offices at 100 Congress Street in Springfield.

In 2010, Springfield was cited as the fourth "Greenest City" in the United Statesâ€”the largest city cited in the Top 10. The recognition noted Springfield's numerous parks, the purity of its drinking water, its regional recycling center, and organizations like ReStore Home Improvement Center, which salvages building materials.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestplaces.net/docs/studies/greencities.aspx |title=Green Cities |publisher=Bestplaces.net |access-date=April 14, 2011 |archive-date=June 23, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220623005759/https://www.bestplaces.net/docs/studies/greencities.aspx |url-status=live}}</ref> Springfield features over {{convert|2400|acre|km2|0}} of parkland distributed among 35 urban parks, including the grand, {{convert|735|acre|ha|1}} [[Forest Park (Springfield)|Forest Park]]. Well-known parks include the following, among others:
* [[Apremont Triangle Historic District|Apremont Triangle Park]] is a triangular, pocket park in front of Springfield's historic [[Kimball Towers]] in [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]]. Named for Springfield's [[104th Infantry Regiment (United States)|104th Infantry Regiment]], which following the [[World War I]] Battle of [[Apremont, Ardennes|Apremont]], became the first U.S. military unit awarded for heroism by a foreign power, receiving France's highest military honor: the {{lang|fr|[[Croix de Guerre]]}} for bravery in combat. The same Springfield unit received the same honor again in [[World War II]]. Apremont Triangle Park, steps from both the bohemian [[Kimball Towers]] and upper-class [[Quadrangle-Mattoon Street Historic District]] offers a place to sit amidst the restaurants on the northern fringe of the [[Club Quarter]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://photos.masslive.com/republican/2011/05/springfields_monuments_and_memorials_46.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824104228/http://photos.masslive.com/republican/2011/05/springfields_monuments_and_memorials_46.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 24, 2011 |title=Springfield's monuments and memorials &#124; masslive.com |publisher=Photos.masslive.com |date=May 29, 2011}}</ref>
* Armoury Commons is a rectangular park just south of the [[Springfield Armory]], located at the corner of Pearl and Spring Streets in [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]]. Renovated in 2009, Armoury Commons features several sculptures, including Pynchon Park's original sculpture. The park is often used as a place to play chess and other games.
* [[Connecticut River Walk Park]] is a narrow, landscaped park that snakes along the scenic [[Connecticut River]] for several miles. Beginning near the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]], it features jogging trails, benches, boat docks, and plazasâ€”all of which afford scenic vistas of the [[Connecticut River]] and [[Connecticut River Valley]]. However, Interstate 91's position, height, and ancillary structuresâ€”including a 1,756-car, below-grade parking lot (the largest in the city), and {{convert|20|ft|m|0|adj=on}} stone walls block all views of the Connecticut River, and all but three passages to the park from [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]]. Despite Springfield's rating as one of the most walkable cities in the U.S., due to the poor planning of I-91, this park can be difficult to reach on foot.<ref name="walkscore1">{{cite web |url=http://www.walkscore.com/MA/Springfield |title=Springfield, Massachusetts Neighborhoods on Walk Score |publisher=Walkscore.com |access-date=December 27, 2011 |archive-date=October 18, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018031528/http://www.walkscore.com/MA/Springfield |url-status=live}}</ref>

* [[Forest Park (Springfield)|Forest Park]] is one of the United States' largest urban parks (at {{convert|735|acre|ha|1}}) and also one of its most historically important urban parks. Amenities include the [[The Zoo In Forest Park|Zoo at Forest Park]], which features many exotic animals; the United States' first public swimming pool (1899); numerous playgrounds; an ice-skating rink; a formal rose garden; the {{convert|31|acre|ha|1}} Porter Lake, which features fishing and paddle-boating; 38 tennis courts; numerous basketball and bocce courts; lawn bowling fields; Victorian promenades and water gardens; dozens of hiking and walking trails; an aquatic park; numerous sculptures; and the Carriage House of Springfielder [[Everett Hosmer Barney]], the man who invented the [[ice skate]] and popularized the [[roller skate]] during the 19th century. During the holiday season, Forest Park hosts the nationally renowned lighting display, [[Bright Nights (Springfield)|Bright Nights]]. Contrary to popular belief, the park was not designed by Fredrick Law Olmsted.
* King Philip's Stockade is an historic park, famous as the site where Native Americans organized the 1675 Sack of Springfield; The Stockade features numerous picnic pavilions, excellent views of the [[Connecticut River Valley]], and a sculpture of ''The Windsor Indian'', who tried in vain to warn the residents of Springfield of coming danger.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barneycarriagehouse.com/bch/ |title=Weddings and Corporate Events at the Carriage House at the Barney Estate, Forest Park, Springfield, MA 01108 |publisher=Barney Carriage House |access-date=April 22, 2011 |archive-date=May 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513090502/http://www.barneycarriagehouse.com/bch/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

It links Springfield's [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]] with the [[Quadrangle (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Quadrangle]] cultural grouping, (the museums and sculptures sit atop a steep bluff). Mostly made of poured concrete, but featuring a waterfall, lush greenery, and fountains, Pynchon Park received numerous accolades from the American Institute of Architecture for "enhancing the quality of the urban environment in the core of the city". It features two levels and a distinctive elevator.<ref name="masslive2">{{cite web |author=Michael S.

===City of Springfield===

Springfield employs a strong-mayor form of city government. [[List of mayors of Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield's mayor]] is Domenic J. Sarno, who has been serving since 2008.

The city's governmental bureaucracy consists of 33 departments, which administer a wide array of municipal services, e.g. police, [[Springfield Fire Department|fire]], public works, parks, public health, housing, economic development, and the [[Springfield Public School System]], New England's 2nd largest public school system.<ref name="masslive">{{cite web |url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/10/springfield_schools_superinten_8.html |title=Springfield Schools Superintendent Daniel Warwick touts students' gains in academics, attendance, behavior &#124; |date=October 4, 2013 |publisher=masslive.com |access-date=October 16, 2014 |archive-date=July 2, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702104114/http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/10/springfield_schools_superinten_8.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Springfield's legislative body is its City Council, which features a mix of eight [[Ward (United States)|ward]] representativesâ€”even though the city has more than twice that many neighborhoods, resulting in several incongruous "wards"â€”and five at-large city representatives, several of whom have served for well over a decade.

====Finances====

In 2003, the City of Springfield was on the brink of financial default, and thus taken over by a Commonwealth-appointed Finance Control Board until 2009. Disbanded in June of that year, the Control Board made great strides stabilizing Springfield's finances.<ref name="bostonfed">{{cite web |url=http://www.bostonfed.org/commdev/pcadp/2009/pcadp0901.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221010/http://www.bostonfed.org/commdev/pcadp/2009/pcadp0901.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-10 |url-status=live |date=September 14, 2009 |title=Towards a More Prosperous Springfield, Massachusetts: Project Introduction and Motivation |author=Lynn Browne |access-date=October 16, 2014}}</ref> While Springfield has achieved balanced budgets since 2009, the city has not enlarged its tax base, and thus many of its public works projectsâ€”which have been in the pipeline for years, some even decadesâ€”remain unfinished (e.g., repairs to Springfield's landmark Campanile).<ref name="springfield-ma2">{{cite web |url=http://www3.springfield-ma.gov/capitalassets/campanile.0.html |title=Springfield, Mass.

Building off of the work of the Control Board, the city's finances have remained stable under Mayor Domenic J. Sarno's (2008â€“present) despite the Great Recession and several natural and man made disasters: [[2011 New England tornado outbreak|June 1, 2011, tornado Springfield Tornado]], [[Hurricane Irene]], a freak [[2011 Halloween nor'easter|October snow storm]] (which in some ways was more damaging than the tornado),<ref name="masslive3">{{cite web |url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/12/western_massachusetts_communit_41.html |title=Western Massachusetts communities deal with cleanup costs in wake of October snowstorm |date=December 27, 2011 |publisher=masslive.com |access-date=October 16, 2014 |archive-date=July 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703092355/http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/12/western_massachusetts_communit_41.html |url-status=live }}</ref> and a large gas explosion in the downtown area in 2012. The city has recovered, however receiving a bond upgrade from Standard and Poor's Investment Services and the GFOA's Distinguished Budget Award for six consecutive years.

===Judicial system===

Like every other municipality in Massachusetts, Springfield has no judicial branch itself. Rather, it uses the Springfield-based state courts, which include Springfield district court and Hampden County [[Massachusetts Superior Court|Superior Court]], both of which are based in Springfield. The [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|Federal District Court]] also regularly hears cases in Springfieldâ€”now in an architecturally award-winning building on State Street, constructed in 2009.

Springfield became a [[City (Massachusetts)|city]] on May 25, 1852, by decree of the [[Massachusetts General Court|Massachusetts Legislature]], after a decade-long internal dispute that resulted in the partition of Chicopee from Springfield, and thus the loss of two fifths of the city's population.

Springfield, like all municipalities in Massachusetts, is subject to limited [[home rule]] municipal power. The current [[charter|city charter]], in effect since 1959, uses a "strong mayor" government with most power concentrated in the [[mayor of Springfield, Massachusetts|mayor]], as in Boston and elsewhere. The mayor representing the city's executive branch presents the budget, appoints commissioners and department heads, and in general runs the city. The mayor is former City Councilor [[Domenic Sarno]], elected November 6, 2007, by a margin of 52.54% to 47.18% against incumbent Charles Ryan. He took office in January 2008. In November 2009 and 2011, Sarno won reelection, albeitâ€”in the latter caseâ€”with just 22% of eligible Springfield voters voting.<ref name="valleyadvocate">{{cite news |last=Turner |first=Maureen |date=December 8, 2011 |title=Newsâ€”Where Were They on Election Day?

The Springfield [[City Council]], consisting of thirteen members, is the city's legislative branch. Elected every odd numbered year, eight of its members are elected to represent "wards", which are made of (sometimes incongruous) groupings of Springfield neighborhoods, e.g. Springfield's ethnic North End neighborhoodsâ€”Memorial Square and Brightwoodâ€”share a ward with Metro Center, Springfield's downtown. Five city council members are elected at-large. The City Council passes the city's budget, holds hearings, creates departments and commissions, and amends zoning laws.

The mayor's office and city council chambers are located in city hallâ€”part of the [[Springfield Municipal Group|Municipal Group]] in Metro Center, Springfield. The Finance Control Board met there as well.

Springfield is heavily Democratic. In the [[2020 US Presidential Election]] Democrat [[Joe Biden]] received 72.4 percent of the vote to Republican [[Donald Trump]]'s 25.7 percent.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://electionstats.state.ma.us/elections/view/140751/filter_by_county:Hampden | title=PD43+ Â» 2020 President General Election Statewide (Showing only Hampden County) | access-date=September 8, 2022 | archive-date=September 8, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220908160417/https://electionstats.state.ma.us/elections/view/140751/filter_by_county:Hampden | url-status=live }}</ref>

In the past, efforts have been made to provide each of the city's eight wards a seat in the city council, instead of the current at-large format. There would still be some at-large seats under this format. The primary argument for this has been that City Councilors live in only four of the city's wards. An initiative to change the composition failed to pass the City Council twice. In 2007 Mayor Charles V. Ryan and City Councilor Jose Tosado proposed a home-rule amendment that would expand the council to thirteen members adding four seats to the existing nine member at large system, but allocated between eight ward and five at large seats. This home-rule petition was adopted by the City Council 8â€“1, and was later passed by the State Senate and House and signed by the Governor. On election day, November 6, 2007, city residents voted overwhelmingly in favor of changing the City Council and School Committee. The ballot initiative that established a new council with five at-large seats and eight ward seats passed 3â€“1. On November 3, 2009, Springfield held its first ward elections in 50 years.

==Education==

[[File:Springfield City Library, Central Branch.jpg|thumb|right|Central Branch of [[Springfield City Library]]]]

===Grade schools===
[[The Springfield Plan]] for [[citizenship education (subject)|citizenship education]] drew national attention in the 1940s for its efforts to combat racism.

====Public schools (Kâ€“12)====

Springfield has the second-largest school district in Massachusetts and in New England. It operates 38 elementary schools, six high schools, six middle schools (6â€“8), and seven specialized schools. The main high schools in the city include the [[High School of Commerce (Massachusetts)|High School of Commerce]], [[Springfield Central High School]], [[Roger L Putnam Vocational-Technical High School]], and the [[Springfield High School of Science and Technology]], better known as Sci-Tech. There are also two charter secondary schools in the City of Springfield: SABIS International, which ranks among the top 5% of high schools nationally in academic quality, and the Hampden Charter School of Science.

The city is required under a 1970s court order to balance schools racially, which had necessitated busing. However, since then, the city and the school's population has shifted and many of the neighborhoods are more [[Racial integration|integrated]], calling into question the need for busing at all.

In June 2015, [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Governor]] [[Charlie Baker]] announced $3.2 million in grants to three underperforming middle schools in Springfield.<ref>{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Michelle|title=State awards $4.48 million to school turnaround efforts in Springfield, Worcester|website=[[The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)|MassLive.com]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|url=https://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/06/state_awards_over_four_million.html|date=June 8, 2015|access-date=June 23, 2018|archive-date=November 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201113170437/https://www.masslive.com/news/2015/06/state_awards_over_four_million.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Private schools====

The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Springfield in Massachusetts|Roman Catholic Diocese of Springfield]] operated five Catholic elementary schools in the city, all of which were consolidated into a single entity, St. Michael's Academy, in the autumn of 2009.<ref>[http://www.masslive.com/metrowest/republican/index.ssf?/base/news-17/1232787365176350.xml&coll=1 Catholic grade schools remade] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328171232/http://www.masslive.com/metrowest/republican/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews-17%2F1232787365176350.xml&coll=1 |date=March 28, 2012 }}, ''The Republican'', January 24, 2009</ref> The non-denominational [[Pioneer Valley Christian School|Pioneer Valley Christian Academy]] is located in the suburban [[Sixteen Acres, Springfield, Massachusetts|Sixteen Acres]] neighborhood, educating Kâ€“12.<ref>[http://www.pvcama.org/ Pioneer Valley Christian Academy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310195435/http://pvcama.org/ |date=March 10, 2017 }}.

===Higher education===

====Universities and colleges====

The [[Knowledge Corridor]] boasts the second-largest concentration of higher learning institutions in the United States, with 32 universities and [[liberal arts colleges]] and over 160,000 university students in Greater Hartfordâ€“Springfield. This includes two college consortia, the [[Five Colleges (Massachusetts)|Five Colleges]], and the [[Cooperating Colleges of Greater Springfield]], whose member institutions often collaborate in greater outreach programs. Within {{convert|16|mi|km|0}} of Springfield's [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]], there are 18 universities and liberal arts colleges, which enroll approximately 100,000 students.<ref name="nu">{{cite web |url=http://nuwnotes1.nu.com/apps/wmeco/webcontent.nsf/AR/econ_review_2010/$File/2010_wmeco_Review.pdf |date=January 10, 2011 |title=Western Massachusetts 2010â€“2011 Economic Review |access-date=October 16, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202012925/http://nuwnotes1.nu.com/apps/wmeco/webcontent.nsf/AR/econ_review_2010/$File/2010_wmeco_Review.pdf |archive-date=February 2, 2015 }}</ref>

As of 2015, Springfield attracts over 20,000 university students per year. Its universities and colleges include [[Western New England College|Western New England University]]; [[Springfield College]], famous as the birthplace of the sport of basketball (1891) and the nation's first [[physical education]] class, (1912); [[American International College]], founded to educate America's immigrant population, is notable as the inventor of the [[Model Congress]] program. [[UMass Amherst]] relocated its urban design center graduate program to [[Court Square]] in Metro Center.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/elm_street.0.html |title=Court Square Springfield, Mass.: Home Page |publisher=Springfieldcityhall.com |date=July 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719162257/http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/elm_street.0.html |archive-date=July 19, 2011 }}</ref>

Several of Greater Springfield's institutions rank among the most prestigious in the world. For example, [[Amherst College]], {{convert|15|mi|km|0}} north of Springfield, and [[Smith College]], {{convert|13|mi|km|0}} north of Springfield, consistently rank among America's top 10 liberal arts colleges. [[Mount Holyoke College]]â€”the United States' first women's collegeâ€”consistently ranks among America's Top 15 colleges, and it is located only {{convert|9|mi|km|0}} north of Springfield. [[Hampshire College]] is located {{convert|14|mi|km|0}} north of Springfield. The 30,000-student [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] is located {{convert|16|mi|km|0}} north of Springfield. Approximately {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} west of Springfield, across the Memorial Bridge in Westfield, is [[Westfield State University]], founded by noted education reformer [[Horace Mann]]. Westfield was the first university in America to admit students without regard to sex, race, or economic status.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wsc.ma.edu/prospective-students/undergraduate-admissions/after-you-apply/ |title=After You Apply : Undergraduate Admissions : Prospective Students : Westfield State University |publisher=Wsc.ma.edu |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604041344/http://www.wsc.ma.edu/prospective-students/undergraduate-admissions/after-you-apply/ |archive-date=June 4, 2011 }}</ref>

Just outside Springfield's northern city limits is [[Elms College]], a Catholic college. Likewise, just {{convert|2|mi|km|1}} below Springfield's southern city limit in [[Longmeadow]] is [[Bay Path University]]; both schools were once all-women but are now co-ed.

====Community colleges====

In 1968, following the Pentagon's controversial closing of the [[Springfield Armory]], Springfielders founded [[Springfield Technical Community College]] on {{convert|35|acre|ha|1}} behind the Springfield Armory National Park. Springfield Technical Community College is the only polytechnic community college in Massachusetts, and was founded to continue Springfield's tradition of technical innovation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://shaysrebellion.stcc.edu/shaysapp/about/project.jsp |title=Shays' Rebellionâ€”About This Project |publisher=Shaysrebellion.stcc.edu |access-date=May 30, 2011 |archive-date=July 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720050248/http://shaysrebellion.stcc.edu/shaysapp/about/project.jsp |url-status=live }}</ref>

++WFXQ-CD rebroadcasts WWLP.
* [[WWLP-TV]] 22 WWLP-TV is the [[NBC]] affiliate for the area, and also carries subchannel affiliations with [[The CW]] and [[Ion Television]]. WWLP-TV is owned and operated by the [[Nexstar Media Group]], and maintains studios in nearby Chicopee (where the station moved from their old studios atop [[Provin Mountain]]). WWLP is the oldest TV station to air regularly scheduled programming in the market, launching its schedule on March 17, 1953, on Channel 61. WWLP also operated WRLP (UHF 32), a UHF station licensed to [[Greenfield, Massachusetts|Greenfield]], whose transmitter was in [[Winchester, New Hampshire]], as well as W69AQ (UHF 69), a low power station that transmitted from the WWLP tower on Provin Mountain.
* [[WGGB]] 40 WGGB is the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and primary [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], secondary [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate for the area. WGGB is owned and operated by [[Gray Television]] and its studios are on Liberty Street near the Chicopee line. WGGB (originally WHYN) signed on on April 1, 1953, on Channel 55. In 1958, WHYN switched to UHF 40. Guy Gannett Broadcasting bought the station in 1979 and changed its call sign to the current WGGB-TV effective at the start of the following year. In 2008, WGGB launched a secondary service called "Fox 6", named after its channel position on the local [[Comcast]] cable TV lineup. FOX6 also appears on WGGB's [[Digital Television|DTV]] sub-channel 40.2. WGGB's analog television signal signed off permanently in late November 2008, due to a transmitter failure. WGGB and WSHM-LD broadcast local news under the branding "Western Mass News", and maintain a relationship with the ''[[Springfield Republican]]''.
* [[WSHM-LD]] 3 WSHM-LD is Springfield's [[CBS]] affiliate operated by Hartford's [[WFSB]]. WSHM is owned and operated by Gray Television and shares studios with WGGB on Liberty Street near the Chicopee line. WSHM-LD and WGGB broadcast local news under the branding "Western Mass News", and maintain a relationship with the ''[[Springfield Republican]]''. WSHM-LD was formerly W67DF, a translator of [[Trinity Broadcasting Network|TBN]], before being sold to the Meredith Corporation, WFSB's then-owners. WSHM-LD is referred to as "CBS 3", denoting its cable channel assignment within the market and to encourage long-time viewers of WFSB to stay with WSHM-LD.
* [[WGBY]] 57 WGBY is the [[PBS]] member station for the area. WGBY's studios are in downtown Springfield, near Interstate 91 and the [[Conrail]] train lines. WGBY signed on in 1963. WGBY is owned by the Boston-based [[WGBH Educational Foundation]] and is operated by [[New England Public Media]]. WGBY signed off their analog signal permanently in November 2008, to allow for the replacement of [[transmitting antenna|transmission antennas]].

====Cable operators====

Springfield proper is serviced exclusively by [[Comcast]] cable. Springfield was formerly wired with a "dual plant" cable system from 1980 until 2001, requiring an A/B switch for each home to watch programming and complicating [[Videocassette recorder|VCR recordings]].

===Radio===
Springfield was home to the first commercially licensed radio station in the United States, and the oldest radio station of any kind in New England: [[WBZ (AM)|WBZ]], which broadcast live from Springfield's luxurious [[Hotel Kimball]] at 140 Chestnut Street (now the [[Kimball Towers Condominiums]]) before moving to Boston in 1931.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.springfield375.org/|title=Springfield 375â€”Springfield's Official 375th Anniversary Celebration Site|date=July 21, 2013|access-date=July 12, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721031431/http://www.springfield375.org/|archive-date=July 21, 2013}}</ref>

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
[[File:Springfield Union Station, July 2016.jpg|thumb|[[Springfield Union Station (Massachusetts)|Union Station]] is used for bus, Amtrak, and commuter rail service]]

Springfield is called the ''Crossroads of New England'' because it is the major shipping nexus from New York City, Boston, [[Montreal]] and the [[Great Lakes]] (via [[Albany, New York]]). Much of the cargo heading from one of these places to another crosses through the City of Springfield.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} As a geographical trade center, Springfield has more advantages than just being equidistant to these other large trade centersâ€”it sits beside the [[Connecticut River]], is located near some of the most fertile farmland in the Northeast, and is served by numerous rail lines and [[Interstate Highways]], including [[I-90 (MA)|I-90]] ([[Massachusetts Turnpike|Mass Pike]]) and [[I-91 (MA)|I-91]], which connect New Haven, Hartford, Holyoke, [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]], and [[Vermont]] to Springfield. One of the few spurs of I-91 in Massachusetts, [[Interstate 291 (Massachusetts)|I-291]], runs through Springfield, and provides a secondary connection between I-90 and I-91.

====Rail====
[[Springfield Union Station (Massachusetts)|Springfield Union Station]], originally opened in 1926 and re-opened in 2017, is served by five [[Amtrak]] intercity routes: the ''[[Vermonter (train)|Vermonter]]'', which runs from Washington, D.C. to St. Albans, Vermont; the ''[[Lake Shore Limited]]'', which runs from Chicago to Boston; the [[Amtrak Hartford Line|Amtrak ''Hartford Line'']], which runs from Springfield to New Haven; the ''[[Valley Flyer (Amtrak train)|Valley Flyer]]'', which runs from New Haven to Greenfield; and the ''[[Northeast Regional]]'', which runs from Springfield to D.C./Virginia. Amtrak relocated its operations into Union Station proper from their previous track side station building in June 2019.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://media.amtrak.com/2019/06/amtrak-trains-return-to-historic-springfield-union-station/ | title = Amtrak Trains Return to Historic Springfield Union Station | publisher = Amtrak | date = 2019-06-10 | accessdate = 2024-07-09}}</ref>

[[CTRail]]'s [[Hartford Line]] started operating from Union Station in June 2018, with Springfield as the northern terminus. Trains operate to New Haven, CT with multiple stops in Connecticut along the way. The line shares the same route and station listing as the Amtrak route of the same name, and the two are operated in conjunction as a commuter rail service for the region.

The [[New Havenâ€“Springfield Line]] was upgraded in conjunction with the launch of the Hartford Line service. The project received funding from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Federal Government, and the State of Connecticut. Amtrak trains on the route between New Haven and Springfield reach speeds of {{convert|110|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.

In 2011, Springfield Union Station started a $70&nbsp;million renovation to become an intermodal transportation facility, allowing [[Peter Pan Bus]], [[Greyhound Bus]], and the [[PVTA]] to occupy a modern space next to the renovated Union Station.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.springfield-ma.gov/planning/union_station.0.html |title=Springfield Redevelopment Authority: Springfield Union Station |website=Springfield-ma.gov |access-date=July 12, 2017 |archive-date=June 29, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629074429/http://www3.springfield-ma.gov/planning/union_station.0.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was completed in June 2017.

There are no major freight yards in Springfield proper, but [[Connecticut Southern Railroad]] and [[CSX]] serve CSX's West Springfield yard across the Connecticut River.

====Bus====

The [[Pioneer Valley Transit Authority]] (PVTA) is based in Springfield and uses [[Springfield Union Station (Massachusetts)|Union Station]] as its Springfield hub, next to the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] arch that denotes the entrance to [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|downtown Springfield]]. The PVTA operates nineteen bus routes from Union Station. The PVTA's Springfield service area includes Springfield, Holyoke, Chicopee, Westfield, West Springfield, Ludlow, Agawam, and East Longmeadow. With transfers, it is possible to travel into PVTA's northern service area, which includes Northampton, Amherst, and Easthampton.

Intercity bus service is provided by [[Peter Pan Bus Lines]] and [[Greyhound Lines]], both of which operate from Union Station. They provide service to destinations across the northeast United States.

====Air====

Springfield is primarily served by [[Bradley International Airport]], in [[Windsor Locks, Connecticut]], {{convert|12|mi}} south of downtown. It features over 100 daily departures to 30 destinations on nine airlines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bradleyairport.com/Flights/destinations.aspx |title=Destinations |publisher=Bradleyairport.com |date=April 5, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604083658/http://www.bradleyairport.com/Flights/destinations.aspx |archive-date=June 4, 2012 }}</ref> It is also the primary airport for Hartford.

Other regional airports serving Springfield include:
* [[Westfield-Barnes Regional Airport]] is 12 miles (19&nbsp;km) from downtown Springfield in [[Westfield, Massachusetts]]. It is 1.5 miles (2.4&nbsp;km) from the Massachusetts Turnpike.
* [[Westover Metropolitan Airport]] is {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} from downtown Springfield. It is {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} from the Massachusetts Turnpike.
* [[Logan International Airport]] in Boston is approximately {{convert|80|mi|km|round=5}} northeast of Springfield.
