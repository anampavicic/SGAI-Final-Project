'''Galați''' ({{IPA|ro|ɡaˈlatsʲ|-|Ro-Galați.ogg}}) is a county ([[județ]]) of [[Romania]], in [[Moldavia]] region, with the capital city at [[Galați]], between [[latitude|45°25'N]] and [[latitude|46°10'N]] latitude, [[longitude|27°20'E]] and [[longitude|28°10'E]] longitude. It borders the counties of [[Vaslui County|Vaslui]], [[Vrancea County|Vrancea]], [[Brăila County|Brăila]], [[Tulcea County|Tulcea]]. To the east it borders the [[Republic of Moldova]], the border crossing points being Galați&ndash;[[Giurgiulești]] (road and [[broad gauge railway]]) and Oancea&ndash;[[Cahul]] (road). The county was established in 1968, through the territorial reorganization of the former {{ill|Galați Region|ro|Regiunea Galați}}, which included a territory similar to that of the current Brăila and Galați counties, plus the northern part of Tulcea County. 

Galați County is part of the ''[[Sud-Est (development region)|South-East Development Region]]'' (together with the counties of Vrancea, Buzău, Brăila, Constanța and Tulcea), of the ''[[Lower Danube (Euroregion)|Lower Danube Euroregion]]'' (together with the counties of Brăila and Tulcea, with the [[Cahul district|Cahul]] and [[Cantemir district|Cantemir]] districts in the south of the [[Republic of Moldova]] and with the [[Odesa region]] in the west of Ukraine) as well as the ''Free Economic Zone [[ Galați]]&ndash;[[Giurgiulești]]&ndash;[[Reni, Ukraine|Reni]]'' (Romania-Moldova-Ukraine).

The discovery of the [[Castra of Tirighina-Bărboși|thesaurus of Barboși]] (southern quarter of the city of [[Galați]], on the left bank of the Siret river), composed of 3,700&nbsp;silver coins bearing the Greek inscriptions ''Gallati'' and '' Kallatiasy'', will tip the scales towards the theory supported by [[Vasile Pârvan]] and [[Carl Patsch]], which is the basis of the name of the Roman province [[Galatia]] in [[Asia Minor]]. The name ''Galați'' is also known as Kalas in Turkish, [[:el:Γκαλάτσι|Γκαλάτσι]] in Greek and [[:he:גאלאץ|גאלאץ]] in Hebrew.

{{Blockquote|However, the theory most accepted by historians is that the name ''Galați'' derives from old names of people, inhabitants of this area of the country. As Professor [[Paul Păltănea|Păltănea]] also concludes, the onomastic value of the word ''Galați'' is proven by old inscriptions on which the names of people like ''Vasile Gălată'', ''Petrea Galați'', ''Marin Galați'' were found. In Romanian documents and chronicles, the name of the city is found in the form ''Gălați'' or ''Gălat'', and in those from other countries it is mentioned as ''Gallaz'', ''Galatz'', ''Galazzo''|Ionel Cândea, Professor at the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the Lower Danube University in Galaţi<ref name="Originea numelui orașului Galați"/>}}

Finally, other hypotheses call for [[Slavs|Slavic]] or [[Cuman]] etymologies. According to one, the inhabitants of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] - [[Ukrainians]] originally from the mountainous regions of the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] - would have given the name to the city of Galați in the 13th&nbsp;century, when the [[Principality of Galicia-Volhynia]] expanded its area of commercial and political influence in [[Moldavia]]. This is the thesis favoured by Russian and Ukrainian historical circles. Also, the [[Serbs]] claim that the origin of the name is ''Galac''. According to the other, the name derives from the [[Cuman]] ''galat'', which appears, also from the 13th&nbsp;century, in other toponyms from the surroundings, for example ''Gălățui'', a lake name whose suffix is Cuman (the suffix ''[-ui]'' means "water".<ref name="Brezeanu">{{cite book |title=Romanitatea orientală în evul mediu: de la cetățenii romani la națiunea medievală|trans-title=Oriental Romanity in the Middle Ages: From Roman Citizens to Medieval Nation |last=Brezeanu |first=Stelian |year=1999 |publisher=Ed.

== Geography and environment ==
=== Boundaries ===
<div style="float:right">{{Romanian counties map|right|width=250px}}</div>
The county lies on a low plain, between the [[Prut|Prut River]] to the east, the [[Siret (river)|Siret River]] to the west and southwest. Both flow into the [[Danube]] which forms the border with Tulcea County to the southeast.

Galați County is bordered by:
* [[Moldova|Republic of Moldova]] to the East – [[Cahul District]].
* [[Vrancea County]] to the West.
* [[Vaslui County]] to the North.
* [[Brăila County]] and [[Tulcea County]] to the South.

=== Geography ===
Located at the extreme east–central part of Romania, at the confluence of the Danube with the rivers Siret and Prut, Galați County has an area of {{convert|4,466.3|km2}}, which represents 1.9% of the country's surface. The county includes 4&nbsp;urban centers (the cities of [[Galați]] and [[Tecuci]], the towns of [[Târgu Bujor]] and [[Berești]]) and 61&nbsp;communes comprising 180&nbsp;villages. Confluence area between the Covurlui Plateau to the north (50% of the county's surface), the Tecuci and Covurlui plains (34%), and the lower Siret and Prut meadows to the south (16%), Galați County represents a unitary structure from the [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] point of view. The main watercourses are the rivers [[Danube]], [[Prut]], and [[Siret (river)|Siret]], the main lakes are Brateș {{convert|24|km2}} and Tălăbasca. The maximum altitude is reached in the Fălciu Hills: {{convert|274|m}}.<ref name="cjgalatijud">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cjgalati.ro/index.php/ro/judetul-galati/date-istorice|title=Județul Galați|trans-title=Galați County|website=www.cjgalati.ro|publisher=Consiliul Județean Galați|access-date=2023-06-01|place=Galați|language=ro|format=html|archive-date=31 May 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230531233206/https://www.cjgalati.ro/index.php/ro/judetul-galati/date-istorice|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Relief ===
[[File:UAT judetul Galati.jpg|thumb|UAT judetul Galati]]
Due to its position on the outside of the [[Sub Carpathians|Carpathian arc]], Galați County occupies the area of interpenetration of the edges of the East-European, South-European and partly Central-European geographical sub-regions, which is faithfully reflected both in the climatic conditions, in the vegetation cover and soils, as well as in the geological structure of the relief. The latter offer a view with gentle heights ranging between {{convert|310|m}} in the north and {{convert|5–10|m}} in the south. The territory of Galați County itself presents a tabular (flat) relief with a more pronounced fragmentation in the north and weaker in the south;five geomorphological units can be distinguished, according to altitude, position and relief features: Covurlui Plateau, Tecuci Plain, [[Covurlui|Covurlui Plain]], Low Siret Meadow, and Low Prut Meadow. The old geological formations are of little importance from the point of view of mineral resources. Hydrocarbons (crude oil and natural gas) have been identified and are being extracted in the areas [[Schela, Galați|Schela]]-[[Independența, Galați|Independența]], [[Munteni]]-[[Gohor|Berheci]] and Brateș. Young and especially Quaternary geological formations, consisting of common clays, sands, gravels are exploited in [[Galați]], [[Tecuci]], [[Braniștea, Galați|Braniștea]] and in the minor bed of the river [[Prut]], having particular importance for the construction materials industry.<ref name="cjgalatijud"/>

=== Nature reserves and nature monuments ===
The main natural reserve in Galați County is located on the sands of the Tecuci Plain, namely south of the town of [[Liesti]], around the village of [[Hanu Conachi]], on a strip of about {{convert|4|km}} long and {{convert|0,5–1|km}} wide with an area of about {{convert|84|ha}} and which continues to the Siret meadow. A few distance from the city of Galați is the paleontological reserve of Barboși (Tirighina) with an area of about {{convert|1|ha}}, containing mollusk fossils from the old Euxine phase (about 400,000&nbsp;years ago). Also, not far from Galați, namely to the north of the city, but on the Prut valley, on the territory of the commune [[Tulucești, Galați|Tulucești]], in the place called ''Râpa Bălaia'', there is the second paleontological reserve. The third paleontological reserve is located near the city of Tecuci, on the road [[Tecuci]]-[[Valea Mărului]]-[[Pechea]]-[[Galați]], with a surface of {{convert|1,5|ha}}. The reservation is located on the lower terrace of the [[Bârlad river]], at the point called ''La Rateș'', where there was once an inn. In the eastern part of the county, on the territory of the [[Băneasa, Galați|Băneasa]] commune, between the villages of Băneasa and Roșcani, is the Băneasa Forest, where, in addition to the forest itself, the [[Paeonia peregrina|wild peony]] is also protected, on account of which legends were created and a great popular celebration that takes place every year, the "Peony Festival". Also, in the forest at [[Hanu Conachi]], the "Acacia Festival" is held every year. These two reserves are not only scientific objectives, but also permanent attractions for tourists.<ref name="cjgalatijud"/>

According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], the territory of Galați County belongs entirely to the [[continental climate]] sector. The southern and central part, which represents more than 90% of the surface, is a plain area, and the northern extremity - which accounts for almost 10% of the territory - is a hilly area. In both climatic areas, summers are very hot and dry and  winters are frosty, marked by strong blizzards, but also by frequent temperature changes caused by advections of warm and moist air from the S and SW that cause intervals of warming and melting of the snow cover. Against the general climatic background, the meadows of the Siret, the Prut and the Danube introduce into the values and regime of the main meteorological elements, changes that lead to the creation of a specific meadow topoclimate, wetter and cooler in summer and wetter and less cold in winter. The general circulation of the atmosphere has as its main features the relatively high frequency of slow advections of temperate-oceanic air from the W and NW (especially in the warm semester), the equally high frequency of advections of temperate-continental air from the NE and E (especially in cold season), as well as less frequent advections of arctic air from the N and tropical maritime air from the SW and S.<ref name="cjgalatijud"/>

== History ==
The analysis of the succession and distribution of the archaeological evidence of material culture shows that the territory of the county was populated and entered the circuit of human use from prehistoric times. The oldest human remains in the Covurlui Plateau date from the Final Paleolithic and Epipaleolithic. Paleolithic cultures are located in [[Berești]] and [[Cavadinești]]. The Upper Paleolithic was highlighted in the north of the county, on the current territory of the villages [[Berești-Meria|Pleșa]], [[Berești-Meria|Puricani]], [[Vârlezi|Crăiesti]], [[Bălăbănești, Galați|Bălăbănești]], [[Berești-Meria|Șipote]], [[Rădești, Galați|Rădești]], [[Băneasa, Galați|Băneasa]], [[Suceveni, Galați|Suceveni]].<ref name="cjgalatiist">{{cite web|url=https://www.cjgalati.ro/index.php/ro/judetul-galati/date-istorice|title=Date istorice privind județul Galați|trans-title=Historical data regarding Galati county|publisher=cjgalati.ro|access-date=2023-06-01|place=Galați|format=html|archive-date=31 May 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230531233206/https://www.cjgalati.ro/index.php/ro/judetul-galati/date-istorice|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the strategic archaeological succession, settlements from the old Neolithic, belonging to the [[Starčevo–Körös–Criș culture]], which appear in the form of unfortified settlements, were also located. Traces of this culture were discovered at [[Negrilești, Galați|Negrilești]] and north of [[Tecuci]], in the [[Bârlad (river)|Bârlad River]] valley, at [[Munteni, Galați|Munteni]]. In [[Berești]], traces of the pre-Cucutenian and Cucutenian cultures were highlighted. The pre-Cucutenian culture is represented by bichrome and trichome painted ceramics at [[Foltești, Galați|Stoicani]], [[Măstăcani]], [[Smulți]], [[Drăgănești, Galați|Drăgănești]], [[Băneasa]], [[Suceveni, Galați|Suceveni]]. The citadel of Stoicani shows, through the remains of material culture, the occupations of hunting, animal husbandry and plant cultivation practiced by the inhabitants of this territory, as well as some household crafts, such as pottery, spinning, weaving. The continuity of the population is proven by the material cultures belonging to the period of transition to the [[Bronze Age]], represented by the "shack" type settlements from [[Foltești, Galați|Stoicani]].<ref name="cjgalatiist"/>

The [[Iron Age]] left numerous material traces discovered and researched in more than 15 current localities, showing the penetration of some influences of the Greek civilization from Dobrogea. Thus, Greek ceramics and coins were discovered in [[Galați]], Barboși (neighborhood of the city Galați) and [[Frumușița, Galați|Frumușita]], and in Galați it seems that there was even a Greek settlement. The archaeological remains allow the reconstruction of an axis of the penetration of Greek civilization and material culture in the direction of [[Histria (ancient city)|Histria]] - the mouth of the [[Siret (river)|Siret River]] - Barboși - [[Poiana, Galați|Poiana]] - [[Trotuș]] - [[Oituz (river)|Oituz]], which demonstrates the intensity of the material and spiritual activity of the natives.<ref name="cjgalatiist"/>

The [[Geto-Dacian culture]] is represented by settlements located on the current hearths of [[Galați]] and [[Frumușița]] and by the [[Piroboridava]] settlement ([[Poiana, Galați|Poiana]]). Roman life was particularly intense. The [[Castra of Tirighina-Bărboși|Roman military fort from Barboși]] and the civilian settlement on the hearth of the city of [[Galați]] today maintained trade links with [[Moesia|Lower Moesia]], with [[Greece]] and [[Asia Minor]] on the Danube and the [[Black Sea]]. In the&nbsp;10th-13th&nbsp;centuries, forms of early [[feudalism]], closely related to [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] influence, were registered on the current territory of Galați County, a fact attested by the numerous Byzantine coins discovered.<ref name="cjgalatiist"/>

In the&nbsp;XV-XVI&nbsp;centuries, numerous settlements are attested by written historical documents, such as [[Ivești, Galați|Blăjerii de Jos]] (1448), [[Liești]] (1495), [[Liești, Galați| Șerbănești]] (1430), [[Bucești]] (1548), [[Drăgănești, Galați|Drăgănești]] (1575), and in the 17th century [[Umbrărești]] (1649), [[Umbrărești|Salcea]] (1695) etc. On the map of [[Dimitrie Cantemir]] from ''[[Descriptio Moldaviae]]'', the settlements [[Nicorești]], [[Poiana, Galați|Poiana]], [[Piscu]], [[Corod]], [[Oancea]], [[Drăgușeni, Galați|Adam]], [[Tulucești]], [[Foltești]], [[Tecuci]], [[Galați]] are recorded.<ref>{{cite book|title=Descriptio Moldaviae|trans-title=Description of [[Moldavia]]|last=Cantemir|first=Dimitrie|year=1872|publisher=Typographia Curtii (Lucratorii Associati)|place=Bucharest|oclc=1128941572}}</ref>

At the end of the 17th&nbsp;century and the beginning of the 18th&nbsp;century, ''Slobozia''-type settlements<ref group="n">''Slobozie'' was a settlement of colonists (natives or foreigners) who had, for a certain period, exemption from taxes or benefits</ref> appeared, which lead to the thickening of the network of rural settlements, of which [[Slobozia Blăneasa]], [[Slobozia Oancea]], [[Slobozia Conachi]], and [[Slobozia Corni]] still exist. In the second half of the 19th&nbsp;century, new rural settlements appeared as a result of the increase in the production of grain goods after the [[unification of the Romanian Principalities ]] of 1859, the [[agrarian reform]] of 1864 and after the Rural Law of 1878. The different forms of population growth - migrations, agricultural herding, slow infiltrations and colonizations, immigrations ([[Lipovan]]s, Greeks, Bulgarians, Armenians, Jews etc.) - contributed to changing the demographic structure of the county. Thus, the population growth was stimulated by the development of agriculture, by the liberalization of trade, by the intensification of transport, by the processes of free transfer by the state of land ownership rights to the peasants.<ref name="cjgalatiist"/>

[[File:Muzeul de Istorie Galati.jpg|thumb|The house that belonged to the Cuza family and where [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] lived during the period when he was a judge and ''pârcălab'' (burgrave) of the [[Covurlui County]], currently the seat of the History Museum ''Paul Păltănea'' in Galați]]
In the first half of the 19th&nbsp;century, social-political turmoil and numerous conflicts took place. They contributed to the acceleration of the process of disintegration of feudal relations and the emergence and emphasis of capitalist production relations. The popular masses of the county acted in the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821|anti-Ottoman movement]] from 1821 and in the [[Revolutions of 1848#Romanian Principalities|revolutionary ones]] from 1848. The active participation of the population of the former counties [[Covurlui County|Covurlui]] and [[Tecuci County|Tecuci]] in the political fight for the [[Unification of Moldavia and Wallachia|unification of the Romanian Principalities]] was determined, in large part, by the fact that two of the most important militants for unification lived and worked here: [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]], former ''pârcălab'' ([[burgrave]]) of [[Covurlui County]], and [[Costache Negri]] (born in the village of [[Costache Negri, Galați|Mînjina]]). At Mînjina, prominent personalities of the Romanian nation, such as [[Nicolae Bălcescu]], [[Ion Ghica]], [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]], [[Vasile Alecsandri]], [[Alecu Russo]], and [[Grigore Alexandrescu]] participated in the development of unionist ideas.<ref name="cjgalatiist"/>

If during the years of the [[Socialist Republic of Romania|communist era]], Galați County had become the 4th largest industrial center of Romania, in recent years it has registered a sharp decline, which led to its inclusion, along with 5 other counties in Romania (Mureș, Prahova, Dolj, Gorj, Hunedoara) in the [[Just Transition]] Mechanism financed by the European Union, which attempts to reduce the social and economic impact of the transition of mono-industrial and coal-intensive regions to a decarbonized economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mfinante.gov.ro/prezentarea-mecanismului-pentru-o-tranzitie-justa|title=Prezentarea Mecanismului pentru o Tranziție Justă (MTJ)|trans-title=Introducing the Just Transition Mechanism (JTM)|access-date=2023-06-01|website=mfinante.gov.ro|publisher=Ministerul Finanțelor}}</ref>

According to the statements of the President of the County Council, Costel Fotea (May 2022), "''the transformation of steel production is an approach that will be carried out in a context where, in recent years, technological developments and market conditions have determined a decline in the degree of employment in the metallurgical industry of the county. Thus, the number of employees decreased by more than 36% in the period 2011-2020. The territory showed a sharp downward trend, of 6.5%, in the period 2012-2020, of the global population, while the downward trend of the working-age population was in the same period of 10.5%. Between 2010 and 2020, the average net salary was, each year, below the national average by about 11%, but the downward trend is clear. Between 2016 and 2020, the difference to the national average was -14%. The territory has an energy poverty rate of 55% in winter and 40% year-round.
