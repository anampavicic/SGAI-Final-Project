The [[history of Bavaria]] includes its earliest settlement by [[Iron Age]] [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes, followed by the conquests of the [[Roman Empire]] in the 1st century BC, when the territory was incorporated into the provinces of [[Raetia]] and [[Noricum]]. It became the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] (a [[stem duchy]]) in the 6th century AD following the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. It was later incorporated into the [[Holy Roman Empire]], became the independent [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] after 1806, joined the Prussian-led [[German Empire]] in 1871 while retaining its title of kingdom, and finally became a [[states of Germany|state]] of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] in 1949.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bavaria |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Bavaria |website=Britannica |access-date=31 August 2015 |archive-date=5 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905062341/https://www.britannica.com/place/Bavaria |url-status=live }}</ref>

Around the year 500 AD, some elements of that victorious Marcomanni people would help to form the [[Bavarii]] confederation, which incorporated [[Bohemia]] and Bavaria.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kessler |first=P.

[[Tassilo I of Bavaria]] tried unsuccessfully to hold the eastern frontier against the expansion of [[Slavic peoples]] and the [[Pannonian Avars]] around 600. [[Garibald II of Bavaria|Garibald II]] seems to have achieved a balance of power between 610 and 616.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Bavaria |url=http://www.guide-to-bavaria.com/en/Bavaria-History.html |website=Guide to Bavaria |access-date=31 August 2015 |archive-date=6 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906235754/http://www.guide-to-bavaria.com/en/Bavaria-History.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

At Hugbert's death in 735, the [[duchy]] passed to [[Odilo of Bavaria]] from the neighboring [[Alemannia]]. Odilo issued a [[Lex Baiuvariorum]] for Bavaria, completed the process of church organization in partnership with [[Saint Boniface]] in 739, and tried to intervene in Frankish succession disputes by fighting for the claims of the [[Carolingian dynasty]]. He was defeated near [[Augsburg]] in 743 but continued to rule until his death in 748.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Frassetto |first1=Michael |title=The Early Medieval World: From the Fall of Rome to the Time of Charlemagne [2 Volumes] |date=2013 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1598849967 |page=145 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Collins |first1=Roger |title=Early Medieval Europe, 300–1000 |date=2010 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1137014283 |page=273 }}</ref>

[[Saint Boniface]] completed the people's conversion to Christianity in the early 8th century. [[Tassilo III of Bavaria]] succeeded to rule Bavaria. He initially ruled under Frankish oversight but began to function independently from 763 onward. He was particularly noted for founding new monasteries and for expanding eastwards, oppressing [[Slavs]] in the [[eastern Alps]] and along the [[Danube]] and colonizing these lands. After 781, however, Charlemagne began to exert pressure and Tassilo III was deposed in 788. Dissenters attempted a coup against [[Charlemagne]] at [[Regensburg]] in 792, led by [[Pepin the Hunchback]].

[[File:Karte Herzogtum Bayern im 10. Jahrhundert.png|thumb|left|A map of Bavaria in the 10th century]]

With the revolt of [[Henry II, Duke of Bavaria]] in 976, Bavaria lost large territories in the south and southeast.

One of the most important dukes of Bavaria was [[Henry the Lion]] of the [[house of Welf]], founder of [[Munich]], and ''de facto'' the second most powerful man in the empire as the ruler of two duchies. When in 1180, Henry the Lion was deposed as Duke of [[Saxony]] and Bavaria by his cousin, [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor]] (a.k.a. "Barbarossa" for his red beard), Bavaria was awarded as [[fief]] to the [[Wittelsbach]] family, counts palatinate of Schyren ("Scheyern" in modern German). They ruled for 738 years, from 1180 to 1918. In 1180, however, [[Styria]] was also separated from Bavaria. The [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] by Rhine (''Kurpfalz'' in German) was also acquired by the [[House of Wittelsbach]] in 1214, which they would subsequently hold for six centuries.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Harrington |first1=Joel F. |title=Reordering Marriage and Society in Reformation Germany |date=1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521464833 |page=17 }}</ref>

The first of several divisions of the duchy of Bavaria occurred in 1255. With the extinction of the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] in 1268, [[Swabia]]n territories were acquired by the Wittelsbach dukes. [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Louis the Bavarian]] acquired [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]], [[County of Holland|Holland]] and [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] for his House but released the [[Upper Palatinate]] for the Palatinate branch of the Wittelsbach in 1329. That time also [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]] finally became independent from the [[Duchy of Bavaria]].

In the 14th and 15th centuries, upper and lower Bavaria were repeatedly subdivided. Four Duchies existed after the division of 1392: [[Bavaria-Straubing]], [[Bavaria-Landshut]], [[Bavaria-Ingolstadt]] and [[Bavaria-Munich]]. In 1506 with the [[Landshut War of Succession]], the other parts of Bavaria were reunited, and Munich became the sole capital. The country became a center of the Jesuit-inspired [[Counter-Reformation]].

===Electorate of Bavaria===
{{Further|Electorate of Bavaria}}
In 1623, the Bavarian duke replaced his relative of the Palatinate branch, the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] in the early days of the [[Thirty Years' War]] and acquired the powerful [[prince-elector]] dignity in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], determining its Emperor thence forward, as well as special legal status under the empire's laws. During the early and mid-18th century the ambitions of the Bavarian prince electors led to several wars with Austria as well as occupations by Austria ([[War of the Spanish Succession]], [[War of the Austrian Succession]] with the election of a Wittelsbach emperor instead of a Habsburg).<ref>{{Cite web |title=The War of Austrian Succession {{!}} History of Western Civilization II |url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-hccc-worldhistory2/chapter/the-war-of-austrian-succession/ |access-date=28 June 2024 |website=courses.lumenlearning.com}}</ref>

To mark the unification of Bavaria and the [[Electoral Palatinate]], both being principal Wittelsbach territories, Elector [[Maximilian IV Joseph]] was crowned king of Bavaria. King Maximilian Joseph was quick to change the coat of arms. The various heraldic symbols were replaced and a classical Wittelsbach pattern introduced. The white and blue [[Lozenge (heraldry)|lozenge]]s symbolized the unity of the territories within the Bavarian kingdom.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Bee and the Eagle: Napoleonic France and the End of the Holy Roman Empire, 1806 | editor1=  Alan Forrest | editor2= Peter H. Wilson |publisher= Palgrave Macmillan UK| year=2008| isbn=9780230236738| pages=98–99}}</ref>

The new state also comprised the [[Duchy of Jülich]] and [[Berg (state)|Berg]] as these on their part were in personal union with the Palatinate.{{citation needed||date=April 2023}}

===Kingdom of Bavaria===
{{Main|Kingdom of Bavaria}}
[[File:Bayern von 1800 bis heute.png|thumb|A map of Bavaria in the 19th century]]
When the [[Holy Roman Empire]] dissolved under [[Napoleon]]'s onslaught, Bavaria became a [[Kingdom of Bavaria|kingdom]] in 1806 and joined the [[Confederation of the Rhine]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Paul R. Hanson|title=Historical Dictionary of the French Revolution |date=2015 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-0810878921 |edition=2 }}</ref>

The Duchy of Jülich was ceded to France and the Electoral Palatinate was divided between France and the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]]. The Duchy of Berg was given to [[Joachim Murat]]. The [[County of Tyrol]] and the federal state of [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]] were temporarily annexed with Bavaria but eventually ceded to Austria at the [[Congress of Vienna]]. In return, Bavaria was allowed to annex the modern-day region of [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] to the west of the [[Rhine]] and [[Franconia]] in 1815.

Between 1799 and 1817, the leading minister, Count [[Maximilian Joseph von Montgelas|Montgelas]], followed a strict policy of modernization copying Napoleonic France; he laid the foundations of centralized administrative structures that survived the monarchy and, in part, have retained core validity through to the 21st century. In May 1808, a first constitution was passed by [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|Maximilian I]],<ref>{{cite book | author1=James J. Sheehan |title=German History, 1770–1866 |date=1993 |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=978-0198204329 |page=265 }}</ref> being modernized in 1818. This second version established a bicameral Parliament with a House of Lords (''Kammer der Reichsräte'') and a House of Commons (''Kammer der Abgeordneten''). That constitution was followed until the collapse of the monarchy at the end of [[World War I]].

After the rise of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in the early 18th century, Bavaria preserved its independence by playing off the rivalry of Prussia and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]]. Allied to Austria, it was defeated along with Austria in the 1866 [[Austro-Prussian War]] and was not incorporated into the [[North German Federation|North German Confederation]] of 1867, but the question of [[Unification of Germany|German unity]] was still alive. When [[Franco-Prussian War|France declared war on Prussia in 1870]], all the south German states (Baden, Württemberg, Hessen-Darmstadt and Bavaria) aside from Austria, joined the Prussian forces and ultimately joined the Federation, which was renamed {{lang|de|Deutsches Reich}} ([[German Empire]]) in 1871.

Bavaria continued as a monarchy, and retained some special rights within the federation (such as railways and postal services and control of its army in peace times).

===Part of the German Empire===
[[File:Map-DR-Bavaria (blau).svg|thumb|A map of Bavaria in the [[German Empire]], which was formed in 1871 and endured until 1918]]
When Bavaria became part of the newly formed [[German Empire]], this action was considered controversial by [[Bavarian nationalism|Bavarian nationalists]] who had wanted to retain independence from the rest of Germany, as had Austria.

As Bavaria had a heavily [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] majority population, many people resented being ruled by the mostly [[Protestantism in Germany|Protestant]] northerners in [[Prussia]]. As a direct result of the Bavarian-Prussian feud, political parties formed to encourage Bavaria to break away and regain its independence.<ref name="Minahan2000">{{cite book |author1=James Minahan |title=One Europe, Many Nations: A Historical Dictionary of European National Groups |year=2000 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-313-30984-7 |pages=106}}</ref>

In the early 20th century, [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Henrik Ibsen]], and other artists were drawn to Bavaria, especially to the [[Schwabing]] district in Munich, a center of international artistic activity at the time.

===Free State of Bavaria===
[[File:Kriegerdenkmal Dietelskirchen.jpg|thumb|A memorial to soldiers who died in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] in [[Kröning]], Bavaria]]
[[World War I]] led to the abolition of monarchy all over Germany in 1918. The Bavarian monarchy was the first to fall when on 8 November 1918 Socialist politician [[Kurt Eisner]] proclaimed the ''Free State'' (i.e. republic) of Bavaria. Eisner headed a new, republican government as minister-president.  On 12 November, King [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|Ludwig III]] signed the [[Anif declaration]], releasing both civil and military officers from their oaths,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shirer |first1=William L. |title=The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany |date=2011 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York, NY |isbn=9781451642599 |page=33}}</ref> which the Eisner government interpreted as an abdication.<ref>To date, however, no member of the House of Wittelsbach has ever formally declared renunciation of the throne. {{cite news |author1=Imre Karacs |title=Bavaria buries the royal dream Funeral of Prince Albrechty |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/bavaria-buries-the-royal-dream-funeral-of-prince-albrechty-1328457.html |website=The Independent |date=13 July 1996 |access-date=19 September 2017 |archive-date=12 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412160020/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/bavaria-buries-the-royal-dream-funeral-of-prince-albrechty-1328457.html |url-status=dead}}</ref>

After losing the [[Bavarian Landtag elections in the Weimar Republic|January 1919 elections]], Eisner was assassinated in February 1919, ultimately leading to a Communist revolt and the short-lived [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] being proclaimed 6 April 1919. After violent suppression by elements of the German Army and notably the [[Freikorps]], the Bavarian Soviet Republic fell in May 1919. The [[Constitution of Bavaria|Bamberg Constitution]] (''{{lang|de|Bamberger Verfassung}}'') was enacted on 12 or 14 August 1919 and came into force on 15 September 1919, placing Bavaria inside the [[Weimar Republic]].

Extremist activity further increased, notably the 1923 [[Beer Hall Putsch]] led by the [[NSDAP|Nazis]], and Munich and Nuremberg became seen as strongholds of [[Nazism]] during the [[Weimar Republic]] and [[Nazi Germany|Nazi dictatorship]]. However, in the crucial [[German federal election, March 1933]], the Nazis received less than 50% of the votes cast in Bavaria.

As a manufacturing centre, Munich was heavily bombed during [[World War II]] and was occupied by [[United States Armed Forces]], becoming a major part of the American Zone of [[Allied-occupied Germany]], which lasted from 1945 to 1947, and then of [[Bizone]].

The Rhenish Palatinate was detached from Bavaria in 1946 and made part of the new state [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. In 1949, Bavaria became part of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], despite the [[Landtag of Bavaria|Bavarian Parliament]] voting against adopting the [[Basic Law of Germany]], mainly because it was seen as not granting sufficient powers to the individual states (''Länder''), but at the same time declared that it would accept it if two-thirds of the other ''Länder'' ratified it. All of the other states ratified it, so it became law.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/Lexikon/EN:Free_State_of_Bavaria_(Freistaat_Bayern) |title=Free State of Bavaria (Freistaat Bayern) – Historisches Lexikon Bayerns |website=www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de |access-date=11 April 2021 |archive-date=14 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210514130824/https://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/Lexikon/EN:Free_State_of_Bavaria_(Freistaat_Bayern) |url-status=live }}</ref> Thus, during the [[Cold War]], Bavaria was part of [[West Germany]].

===Bavarian identity===
Bavarians have often emphasized a separate national identity and considered themselves as "Bavarians" first, "Germans" second.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.european-vacation-planner.com/bavaria-guide.html |title=Bavaria Guide |date=2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204020156/http://www.european-vacation-planner.com/bavaria-guide.html |archive-date=4 February 2013 |url-status=dead |website=European-Vacation-Planner.com |access-date=16 July 2013}}</ref> In the 19th-century sense, an independent [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] existed from only 1806 to 1871. A separate Bavarian identity was emphasized more strongly when Bavaria joined the Prussia-dominated [[German Empire]] in 1871, while the [[Bavarian nationalism|Bavarian nationalists]] wanted to keep Bavaria as Catholic and an independent state. Aside from the minority [[Bavaria Party]], most Bavarians now accept Bavaria as part of Germany.<ref>{{Cite web| author1=Kate Lunau  |url=http://www.macleans.ca/2009/06/25/no-more-bavarian-separatism/ |title=No more Bavarian separatism |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104213035/http://www2.macleans.ca/2009/06/25/no-more-bavarian-separatism/ |archive-date=4 January 2014 |url-status=live |work=[[Maclean's]] |date=25 June 2009 |access-date=16 July 2013}}</ref>

Another consideration is that Bavaria is not culturally uniform. While inhabitants [[Altbayern]] ("Old Bavaria"), the regions forming the historic Bavaria before further acquisitions in 1806–1815, speak a Bavarian dialect of German, [[Franconia]] in the north and Bavarian Swabia in the south west, have their unique culture, including different dialects of German, [[East Franconian German|East Franconian]] and [[Swabian German|Swabian]], respectively.

==Flags and coat of arms==
{{Main|Flag of Bavaria|Coat of arms of Bavaria}}

===Flags===
Uniquely among German states, Bavaria has two official flags of equal status, one with a white and blue stripe, the other with white and blue diamond-shaped [[Lozenge (heraldry)|lozenges]]. Either may be used by civilians and government offices, who are free to choose between them.<ref name="fotw 54">{{cite web |title=Flag Legislation (Bavaria, Germany), Executive Order on Flags of 1954 |url=http://flagspot.net/flags/de-by_lx.html#1954 |work=[[Flags of the World (website)|Flags of the World]] |access-date=19 September 2011 |archive-date=11 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311095529/https://flagspot.net/flags/de-by_lx.html#1954 |url-status=live }}</ref> Unofficial versions of the flag, especially a lozenge style with coat of arms, are sometimes used by civilians.

===Coat of arms===
The modern coat of arms of Bavaria was designed by Eduard Ege in 1946, following heraldic traditions.
*The Golden Lion: At the dexter chief, sable, a [[lion (heraldry)|lion]] rampant Or, armed and langued gules. This represents the administrative region of Upper Palatinate.
*The "[[Franconian Rake]]": At the sinister chief, per [[fess]] dancetty, gules, and argent. This represents the administrative regions of Upper, Middle and Lower Franconia.
*The Blue "Pantier" (mythical creature from [[French heraldry]], sporting a flame instead of a tongue): At the dexter base, argent, a Pantier rampant azure, armed Or and langued gules. This represents the regions of Lower and Upper Bavaria.
*The Three Lions: At the sinister base, Or, three lions passant guardant sable, armed and langued gules. This represents Swabia.
*The White-And-Blue inescutcheon: The [[escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon]] of white and blue fusils askance was originally the coat of arms of the Counts of Bogen, adopted in 1247 by the House of Wittelsbach. The white-and-blue fusils are indisputably the emblem of Bavaria and these arms today symbolize Bavaria as a whole. Along with the People's Crown, it is officially used as the Minor Coat of Arms.
*The People's Crown (''Volkskrone''): The coat of arms is surmounted by a [[Crown (heraldry)|crown]] with a golden band inset with precious stones and decorated with five ornamental leaves. This crown first appeared in the coat of arms to symbolize sovereignty of [[common people|the people]] after the royal crown was eschewed in 1923.

==Geography==
[[File:Über dem Spitzsteinhaus (3650068382).jpg|thumb|The [[Bavarian Alps]] (foreground) and [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] in [[Austria]] (background), including the [[Inn (river)|Inn]] valley (center), [[Kaiser Mountains|Kaisergebirge]] (left), [[:de:Pendling|Pendling]] (right), and the snow-capped [[High Tauern]] (center left)]]
Bavaria shares international borders with [[Austria]] ([[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], [[Upper Austria]] and [[Vorarlberg]]) and the [[Czech Republic]] ([[Karlovy Vary Region|Karlovy Vary]], [[Plzeň Region|Plzeň]] and [[South Bohemian Region]]s), as well as with [[Switzerland]] (across [[Lake Constance]] to the [[Canton of St. Gallen]]).

Neighboring states within Germany are [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Hesse]], [[Thuringia]], and [[Saxony]]. Two major rivers flow through the state: the [[Danube]] (''Donau'') and the [[Main (river)|Main]]. The [[Bavarian Forest]] and the [[Bohemian Forest]] form the vast majority of the frontier with the Czech Republic and Bohemia.

The [[Geographical midpoint of Europe#Geographic centre of the European Union|geographic center of the European Union]] is located in the northwestern corner of Bavaria.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Connolly |first1=Kate |date=6 April 2017 |title=Gadheim – the Bavarian hamlet set to become the centre of a post-Brexit EU |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/06/gadheim-the-bavarian-hamlet-at-the-centre-of-post-brexit-eu |accessdate=5 September 2017 |work=The Guardian}}</ref>

===Climate===
At lower elevations the climate is classified according to [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen's]] guide as "[[Oceanic climate|Cfb]]" or "[[Humid continental climate|Dfb]]". At higher altitudes the climate becomes "[[Subarctic climate|Dfc]]" and "[[Tundra climate|ET]]".

The summer months have been getting hotter in recent years.<ref name="suedd-4539824">{{cite web |url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/bayern-klimawandel-umwelt-vorhersagen-1.4539824 |title=Bayern: So sieht das Klima der Zukunft aus |first=Christian |last=Sebald |website=Süddeutsche.de |date=26 July 2019 |access-date=22 April 2020 |archive-date=3 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803095056/https://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/bayern-klimawandel-umwelt-vorhersagen-1.4539824 |url-status=live }}</ref> For example, June 2019 was the warmest June in Bavaria since weather observations have been recorded<ref name="suedd-4539824" /> and the winter 2019/2020 was 3 degrees Celsius warmer than the average temperature for many years all over Bavaria.

One effect of the continuing warming is the melting of almost all Bavarian [[Alpine glaciers]]: Of the five glaciers of Bavaria only the [[Höllentalferner]] is predicted to exist over a longer time perspective. The [[Schneeferner#Südlicher Schneeferner|Südliche Schneeferner]] has almost vanished since the 1980s.<ref name="suedd-4539824" />

==Administrative divisions==
===Administrative regions===
[[File:WV-Bavaria regions.svg|thumb|The Bavarian administrative regions of ''{{lang|de|Regierungsbezirke}}'' and ''{{lang|de|Bezirke}}'']]
Bavaria is divided into seven administrative regions called ''{{lang|de|Regierungsbezirke}}'' (singular ''{{lang|de|[[Regierungsbezirk]]}}''). Each of these regions has a state agency called the ''{{lang|de|Bezirksregierung}}'' (district government).
*'''[[Altbayern]]''':
*#[[Upper Palatinate]] (''{{langx|de|Oberpfalz}}'')
*#[[Upper Bavaria]] (''{{lang|de|Oberbayern}}'')
*#[[Lower Bavaria]] (''{{lang|de|Niederbayern}}'')
*'''[[Franconia]]''':
*#[[Upper Franconia]] (''{{lang|de|Oberfranken}}'')
*#[[Middle Franconia]] (''{{lang|de|Mittelfranken}}'')
*#[[Lower Franconia]] (''{{lang|de|Unterfranken}}'')
*'''[[Swabia]]''':
*#[[Swabia (administrative region)|Swabia]] (''{{lang|de|Schwaben}}'')

===Bezirke===
''{{lang|de|Bezirke}}'' (regional districts) are the third communal layer in Bavaria; the others are the ''{{lang|de|Landkreise}}'' and the ''{{lang|de|Gemeinden}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Städte}}''. The ''{{lang|de|Bezirke}}'' in Bavaria are territorially identical with the ''{{lang|de|Regierungsbezirke}}'', but they are self-governing regional corporation, having their own parliaments. In the other larger states of Germany, there are only ''{{lang|de|Regierungsbezirke}}'' as administrative divisions and no self-governing entities at the level of the ''{{lang|de|Regierungsbezirke}}'' as the ''{{lang|de|Bezirke}}'' in Bavaria.

===Districts===
[[File:Bavaria, administrative divisions - de - colored.svg|thumb|A map of Bavaria's [[Districts of Germany|districts]]]]
The second communal layer is made up of 71 rural districts (called ''{{lang|de|Landkreise}}'', singular ''{{lang|de|Landkreis}}'') that are comparable to counties, as well as the 25 independent cities (''{{lang|de|Kreisfreie Städte}}'', singular ''{{lang|de|Kreisfreie Stadt}}''), both of which share the same administrative responsibilities.

===Municipalities===
[[File:Frauenkirche and Neues Rathaus Munich March 2013.JPG|thumb|[[Munich]] with [[Munich Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] (left) and [[New Town Hall (Munich)|Rathaus]], Munich's town hall]]

The 71 rural districts are on the lowest level divided into 2,031 regular municipalities (called ''{{lang|de|Gemeinden}}'', singular ''{{lang|de|Gemeinde}}''). Together with the 25 independent cities (''{{lang|de|kreisfreie Städte}}'', which are in effect municipalities independent of ''{{lang|de|Landkreis}}'' administrations), there are a total of 2,056 municipalities in Bavaria.

In 44 of the 71 rural districts, there are a total of 215 [[unincorporated area]]s (as of 1 January 2005, called ''{{lang|de|gemeindefreie Gebiete}}'', singular ''{{lang|de|gemeindefreies Gebiet}}''), not belonging to any municipality, all uninhabited, mostly forested areas, but also four lakes ({{lang|de|[[Chiemsee]]}}-without islands, {{lang|de|[[Starnberger See]]}}-without island {{lang|de|Roseninsel}}, {{lang|de|[[Ammersee]]}}, which are the three largest lakes of Bavaria, and {{lang|de|[[Waginger See]]}}).

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Bavaria}}
[[File:Gobierno Estatal de Baviera, Múnich, Alemania, 2017-07-07, DD 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Bayerische Staatskanzlei|Bavarian State Chancellery]] in [[Munich]]]]
Bavaria has a multiparty system dominated by the conservative [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU), which has won every election since 1945 with the exception of the 1950 ballot. Other important parties are the [[Free Voters]], which became the second largest party in the [[2023 Bavarian state election]], [[Alliance 90/The Greens|The Greens]], which became the second biggest political party in the [[2018 Bavarian state election]]s, and the center-left [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] (SPD), who have dominated the city of [[Munich]] until 2020. Hitherto, [[Wilhelm Hoegner]] has been the only SPD candidate to ever become Minister-President; notable successors in office include multi-term Federal Minister [[Franz Josef Strauss]], a key figure among [[West German]] conservatives during the [[Cold War]] years, and [[Edmund Stoiber]], who both failed with their bids for [[Federal Chancellor of Germany|Chancellorship]].

The German [[Alliance 90/The Greens|Greens]] and the center-right [[Free Voters of Bavaria|Free Voters]] have been represented in the state parliament since 1986 and 2008 respectively.

In the [[Bavaria state election, 2003|2003 elections]] the CSU won a [[Supermajority|⅔ supermajority]] – something no party had ever achieved in postwar Germany. However, in the subsequent [[Bavaria state election, 2008|2008 elections]] the CSU lost the absolute majority for the first time in 46 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.n-tv.de/Koalitionspartner_noetig_Fiasko_fuer_die_CSU/280920085818/1030029.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929151317/http://www.n-tv.de/Koalitionspartner_noetig_Fiasko_fuer_die_CSU/280920085818/1030029.html |url-status=dead |title=n-tv:Fiasko für die CSU |archive-date=29 September 2008}}</ref>

The losses were partly attributed by some to the CSU's stance for an anti-smoking bill.{{explain|date=July 2018}} (A first anti-smoking law had been proposed by the CSU and passed but was watered down after the election, after which a referendum enforced a strict antismoking bill with a large majority).

===Current Landtag <!--update "current"-->===
[[File:Bavarian Landtag 2023.svg|thumb|Current composition of the [[Landtag]]:{{legend|#EB001F|[[SPD]]: 17 seats}}{{legend|#64A12D|[[Alliance 90/The Greens|The Greens]]: 32 seats}}{{legend|#F7A800|[[Free Voters of Bavaria|Free Voters]]: 37 seats}}{{legend|{{party color|Christian Social Union of Bavaria}}|[[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]]: 85 seats}}{{legend|#00ADEF|[[Alternative for Germany|AfD]]: 32 seats}}]]
The [[Bavarian state election, 2023|last state elections]] were held on 8 October 2023. The CSU could almost maintain the results from the last elections with 37%. The Greens lost 3% compared to the last election with a result of 14.4%. The SPD lost again compared to the last election and was now at 8.4%. The liberals of the FDP were not able to reach the five-percent-threshold thus they are not part of the ''Landtag'' anymore, the second time after the 2013 elections. The right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) gained another 4% with now at 14.6% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.landtagswahl2023.bayern.de/sitzeverteilung_landtag.html |title=landtagswahl2023.bayern.de |last=landtagswahl2023.bayern.de |website=landtagswahl2023.bayern.de |access-date=18 November 2023 |archive-date=18 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231118103307/https://www.landtagswahl2023.bayern.de/sitzeverteilung_landtag.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The center-right Free Voters party gained 15.8% of the votes and for the second time formed a government coalition with the CSU which led to the subsequent reelection of Markus Söder as [[Minister-President of Bavaria]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Parliament in Munich re-elects Söder Bavarian premier for third time |url=https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/other/parliament-in-munich-re-elects-s%C3%B6der-bavarian-premier-for-third-time/ar-AA1j9cjz |access-date=18 November 2022 |work=DPA |date=31 October 2023 |archive-date=18 November 2023 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20231118111302/https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/other/parliament-in-munich-re-elects-s%C3%B6der-bavarian-premier-for-third-time/ar-AA1j9cjz |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Government===
*[[Cabinet Söder II|Bavarian Cabinet since 12 November 2018]]
The [[Constitution of Bavaria]] of the Free State of Bavaria was enacted on 8 December 1946. The new Bavarian Constitution became the basis for the Bavarian State after the Second World War.

Bavaria has a [[unicameral]] ''{{lang|de|[[Landtag of Bavaria|Landtag]]}}'' (English: State Parliament), elected by universal suffrage.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History {{!}} Bayerischer Landtag |url=https://www.bayern.landtag.de/en/parliament/history/ |access-date=5 September 2023 |website=www.bayern.landtag.de |archive-date=5 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230905134423/https://www.bayern.landtag.de/en/parliament/history/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Until December 1999, there was also a ''{{lang|de|Senat}}'', or [[Bavarian Senate|Senate]], whose members were chosen by social and economic groups in Bavaria, but following a referendum in 1998, this institution was abolished.<ref>Bavarian State Parliament. (July 2010). ''The Bavarian State Parliament in the Maximilianeum.''

The Bavarian State Government consists of the [[Minister-President of Bavaria]], eleven Ministers and six Secretaries of State. The Minister-President is elected for a period of five years by the State Parliament and is head of state. With the approval of the State Parliament he appoints the members of the State Government. The State Government is composed of the:

*[[Bayerische Staatskanzlei|State Chancellery]] (''{{lang|de|Staatskanzlei}}'')
*Ministry of the [[Bavarian Ministry of the Interior|Interior]], for Sport and Integration (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium des Innern, für Sport und Integration}}'')
*Ministry for Housing, Construction and Transport (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium für Wohnen, Bau und Verkehr}}'')
*Ministry of Justice (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium der Justiz}}'')
*Ministry for Education and Culture (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium für Bildung und Kultus}}'')
*Ministry for Science and Art (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium für Wissenschaft und Kunst}}'')
*Ministry of Finance and for Home Affairs (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium der Finanzen und für Heimat}}'')
*Ministry for Economic Affairs, Regional Development and Energy (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium für Wirtschaft, Landesentwicklung und Energie}}'')
*Ministry for Environment and Consumer Protection (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium für Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz}}'')
*Ministry for Food, Agriculture and Forestry (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium für Ernährung, Landwirtschaft und Forsten}}'')
*Ministry for Family, Labour and Social Affairs (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium für Familie, Arbeit und Soziales}}'')
*Ministry for Health and Care (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium für Gesundheit und Pflege}}'')
*Ministry for Digital Affairs (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium für Digitales}}'')<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bayern.de/staatsregierung/bayerische-staatskanzlei-und-staatsministerien/ |title=Staatsministerien – Bayerisches Landesportal |access-date=11 April 2021 |archive-date=17 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210417041521/https://www.bayern.de/staatsregierung/bayerische-staatskanzlei-und-staatsministerien/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Political processes also take place in the seven regions (''{{lang|de|Regierungsbezirke}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Bezirke}}'') in Bavaria, in the 71 rural districts (''{{lang|de|Landkreise}}'') and the 25 towns and cities forming their own districts (''{{lang|de|kreisfreie Städte}}''), and in the 2,031 local authorities (''{{lang|de|Gemeinden}}'').

In 1995 Bavaria introduced [[direct democracy]] on the local level in a [[referendum]]. This was initiated bottom-up by an association called ''Mehr Demokratie'' (English: More Democracy). This is a grass-roots organization which campaigns for the right to citizen-initiated referendums. In 1997 the Bavarian Supreme Court tightened the regulations considerably (including by introducing a turn-out quorum). Nevertheless, Bavaria has the most advanced regulations on local direct democracy in Germany. This has led to a spirited citizens' participation in communal and municipal affairs—835 referendums took place from 1995 through 2005.

===Designation as a "free state"===
Unlike most German states (''Länder''), which simply designate themselves as "State of" (''Land [...]''), Bavaria uses the style of "Free State of Bavaria" (''Freistaat Bayern''). The difference from other states is purely terminological, as German constitutional law does not draw a distinction between "States" and "Free States". The situation is thus analogous to the United States, where [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|some states]] use the style "Commonwealth" rather than "State". The term "Free State", a creation of the 19th century and intended to be a German alternative to (or translation of) the Latin-derived ''republic,'' was common among the states of the [[Weimar Republic]], after German monarchies had been abolished. Unlike most other states – many of which were new creations – Bavaria has resumed this terminology after [[World War II]]. Two other states, [[Saxony]] and [[Thuringia]], also call themselves "Free State".

===Arbitrary arrest and human rights===
In July 2017, Bavaria's parliament enacted a new revision of the "Gefährdergesetz", allowing the authorities to imprison a person for a three months term, renewable indefinitely, when they have not committed a crime but it is assumed that they might commit a crime "in the near future".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/bayern-gefaehrder-gesetz-verschaerft-1.3595274 |title=Gefährder-Gesetz verschärft |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720190756/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/bayern-gefaehrder-gesetz-verschaerft-1.3595274 |archive-date=20 July 2017 |newspaper=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] |date=19 July 2017 |url-status=live |trans-title=Danger law tightened |language=de}}</ref> Critics like the prominent journalist [[Heribert Prantl]] have called the law "shameful" and compared it to [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/gefaehrder-gesetz-bayern-fuehrt-die-unendlichkeitshaft-ein-1.3594307 |title=Bayern führt Unendlichkeitshaft ein |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170721053942/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/gefaehrder-gesetz-bayern-fuehrt-die-unendlichkeitshaft-ein-1.3594307 |archive-date=21 July 2017 |newspaper=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] |first=Heribert |last=Prant |date=20 July 2017 |url-status=live |trans-title=Bavaria introduces infinity detention |language=de}}</ref> assessed it to be in violation of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lawblog.de/index.php/archives/2017/07/20/bayern-endloshaft-fuer-nicht-straftaeter/ |title=Reisewarnung für Bayern |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827211053/https://www.lawblog.de/index.php/archives/2017/07/20/bayern-endloshaft-fuer-nicht-straftaeter/ |archive-date=27 August 2017 |website=lawblog.de |date=20 July 2017 |url-status=live |trans-title=Travel warning for Bavaria |language=de}}</ref> and also compared it to the legal situation in Russia, where a similar law allows for imprisonment for a maximum term of two years (i.e., not indefinitely).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.fefe.de/?ts=a78e46ba |title=Erinnert ihr euch noch daran, als Bayern als Rechtsstaat galt? |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722195622/http://blog.fefe.de/?ts=a78e46ba |archive-date=22 July 2017 |author=Fefe |author-link=Felix von Leitner |date=20 July 2017 |url-status=live |trans-title=Do you remember when Bavaria was considered a constitutional state? |language=de}}</ref>

===Agriculture===

The most distinctive high points of Bavarian agriculture are:
*[[Humulus lupulus|Hop]] growing in region [[Hallertau]], which is up to 80% of German production and exported worldwide.
*Inland [[aquaculture]] of [[carp]]s and [[trout]].
*The well-hydrated alpine meadows are used to produce large quantities of quality milk, which is used to make a variety of cheese (including [[Cambozola|blue-veined cheese]]), yogurt and butter. 
*The cultivation of [[asparagus]] is widespread, which is a very popular new season vegetable. In season ("Spargelzeit") restaurants offer special separated asparagus menu. There is an asparagus museum in [[Schrobenhausen]].
*There are farms producing venison from [[true deer|deer]] and [[roe deer|roe]].
*[[Viticulture]] is widespread in [[Franconia (wine region)|Lower Franconia]].
*Good ecology and strict control allow for the production of a large amount of organic products ("bio") and baby food.

Bavarians commonly emphasize pride in their traditions. Traditional costumes collectively known as [[Tracht]] are worn on special occasions and include in [[Altbayern]] [[Lederhosen]] for males and [[Dirndl]] for females. Centuries-old [[folk music]] is performed. The [[Maypole tradition in Bavaria|Maibaum]], or Maypole (which in the Middle Ages served as the community's business directory, as figures on the pole represented the trades of the village), and the bagpipes of the Upper Palatinate region bear witness to the [[Paganism in the Eastern Alps|ancient Celtic and Germanic]] remnants of cultural heritage of the region. There are many traditional Bavarian sports disciplines, e.g. the [[Aperschnalzen]], competitive [[whipcracking]].

Whether in Bavaria, overseas or with citizens from other nations Bavarians continue to cultivate their traditions. They hold festivals and dances to keep their heritage alive.

===Food and drink===
{{Main|Bavarian cuisine}}
Bavarians tend to place a great value on food and drink. In addition to their renowned dishes, Bavarians also consume many items of food and drink which are unusual elsewhere in Germany; for example {{lang|de|[[Weißwurst]]}} ("white sausage") or in some instances a variety of entrails. At folk festivals and in many [[beer garden]]s, beer is traditionally served by the litre (in a {{lang|de|[[Maß]]}}). Bavarians are particularly proud<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Bavarian way of life – Bavarian Africa |url=https://africa.bayern.de/the-bavarian-way-of-life/ |access-date=1 September 2022 |language=en-US |archive-date=18 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220818043227/https://africa.bayern.de/the-bavarian-way-of-life/ |url-status=live }}</ref> of the traditional {{lang|de|[[Reinheitsgebot]]}}, or beer purity law, initially established by the [[Duke of Bavaria]] for the City of Munich (i.e. the court) in 1487 and the duchy in 1516. According to this law, only three ingredients were allowed in beer: water, [[barley]], and [[hops]]. In 1906 the {{lang|de|Reinheitsgebot}} made its way to all-German law, and remained a law in Germany until the EU partly struck it down in 1987 as incompatible with the European common market.<ref>{{cite web |title=30.04.2005 – EU-Recht |url=http://dokumentation.htu.tugraz.at/eu-recht/?dok=eugh0003&rub=eugh-e |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050430024608/http://dokumentation.htu.tugraz.at/eu-recht/?dok=eugh0003&rub=eugh-e |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 April 2005 |date=30 April 2005}}</ref> German breweries, however, cling to the principle, and Bavarian breweries still comply with it in order to distinguish their beer brands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.br.de/mediathek/video/sendungen/quer/151022-quer-reinheitsgebot-100.html |title=To Bier or not to Bier? vom 22.10.2015: Das Reinheitsgebot und seine Tücken – BR Mediathek VIDEO |work=br.de |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027012032/http://www.br.de/mediathek/video/sendungen/quer/151022-quer-reinheitsgebot-100.html |archive-date=27 October 2015}}</ref> Bavarians are also known as some of the world's most prolific beer drinkers, with an average annual consumption of 170 liters per person.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}

Bavaria is also home to the [[Franconia (wine region)|Franconia wine region]], which is situated along the river [[Main (river)|Main]] in Franconia. The region has produced wine (''Frankenwein'') for over 1,000 years and is famous for its use of the [[Bocksbeutel]] wine bottle. The production of wine forms an integral part of the regional culture, and many of its villages and cities hold their own wine festivals (Weinfeste) throughout the year.

===Language and dialects===

[[File:Oberdeutsche Mundarten.png|thumb|[[Upper German]] and [[Central German]] form the [[German language]]; [[Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian]] dialects are highlighted in blue.]]
Three German dialects are most commonly spoken in Bavaria: [[Austro-Bavarian]] in Old Bavaria (Upper Bavaria, Lower Bavaria, and the Upper Palatinate), [[Swabian German]] (an [[Alemannic German]] dialect) in the Bavarian part of Swabia (southwest) and [[East Franconian German]] in Franconia (north). In the small town [[Ludwigsstadt]] in the north, district Kronach in Upper Franconia, [[Thuringian dialect]] is spoken. During the 20th century an increasing part of the population began to speak [[Standard German]] (Hochdeutsch), mainly in the cities.

===Ethnography===
Bavarians consider themselves to be [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and informal.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bavaria |url=http://travel-to-germany.info/states/bavaria/ |website=Travel to Germany |date=24 August 2018 |access-date=29 September 2020 |archive-date=28 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200928190152/https://travel-to-germany.info/states/bavaria/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Their sociability can be experienced at the annual [[Oktoberfest]], the world's largest beer festival, which welcomes around six million visitors every year, or in the famous [[beer garden]]s. In traditional Bavarian beer gardens, patrons may bring their own food but buy beer only from the brewery that runs the beer garden.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hirschgarten.de/biergarten-muenchen-koeniglicher-hirschgarten-der-groesste-der-biergaerten-in-muenchen.html |title=Ein paar Worte zu unserem Biergarten in München ...

=== Museums ===
There are around 1,300 museums in Bavaria, including museums of art and cultural history, castles and palaces, archaeological and natural history collections, museums of technological and industrial history, and farm and open-air museums. The history of Bavarian museums dates back to manorial [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]] and [[Treasury|treasuries]]. The art holdings of the [[House of Wittelsbach]] thus formed the first and essential foundation of later state museums. As early as the mid-16th century, Duke Albrecht V (r. 1550–1579) had collected paintings as well as Greek and Roman sculptures (or copies made of them). He had the Antiquarium in the Munich Residence built specifically for his collection of antique sculptures. The electors [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian I]] (r. 1594–1651) and [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria|Max II. Emanuel]] (r. 1679–1726) expanded the art collections considerably. In the [[Age of Enlightenment]] at the end of the 18th century, there was a demand to open up art collections to the general public in the spirit of "popular education". But Museums were not founded by the state until the time of the art-loving [[Ludwig I of Bavaria|King Ludwig I]] (r. 1825–1848). In Munich, he built [[Glyptothek]] (opened 1830), [[Alte Pinakothek]] (opened 1836), and [[Neue Pinakothek]] (opened 1853). Also, the foundation of the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]] in Nuremberg (1852), the establishment of the [[Neue Pinakothek]], which opened in 1853, and the [[Bavarian National Museum]] (1867) in Munich were of central importance for the development of museums in Bavaria in the 19th century. With the end of the monarchy in 1918, many castles and formerly Wittelsbach property passed to the young Free State. In particular, the castles of king [[Ludwig II of Bavaria|Ludwig II]] (r. 1864–1886) [[Neuschwanstein Castle|Neuschwanstein]], [[Linderhof Palace|Linderhof]] and [[Herrenchiemsee]], quickly became magnets for the public. Since then, the number of Bavarian Museums has grown considerably, from 125 in 1907 to around 1,300 today.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Museumslandschaft Bayern - Museen in Bayern |url=https://museen-in-bayern.de/museumslandschaft-bayern |access-date=21 August 2023 |website=museen-in-bayern.de |archive-date=21 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230821081902/https://museen-in-bayern.de/museumslandschaft-bayern |url-status=live }}</ref>
