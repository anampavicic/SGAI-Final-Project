It is also {{convert|120|km|miles}} to the north of [[Tashkent]], [[Uzbekistan]].

==Etymology==
{{unref section|date=May 2024}}
The name Chimkent comes from two [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] words, ''chim'' (meaning 'turf') and ''kent'' (or ''kand'') (meaning 'city') (also found in the name of nearby [[Tashkent|Toshkent]]); thus, it literally means "the city in the grass/turf." After Kazakhstan gained independence, the spelling was changed to ''Shymkent'' in 1993 as part of the government's campaign to apply [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] names to cities. The formal spelling of Shymkent, as codified in Kazakhstan's Constitution, goes against the original Uzbek spelling rules of never having the letter "ы" follow the letter "ш". (The original name in Uzbek itself has no letter [[ы]]. Furthermore, what is spelled as ш in Kazakh is spelled as ч in Uzbek.) As a result, the new name Шымкент (Shymkent) is used only in Kazakhstan, while other countries continue to use the original spelling Чимкент (Chimkent).

==History==
Chimkent was founded in the twelfth century<ref>Peoples of central Asia. By Lawrence Krader. Published by Indiana University, 1971</ref> as a [[caravanserai]] to protect a nearby [[Silk Road]] trade town, [[Sayram (city)|Sayram]], 10&nbsp;km to the east. Chimkent grew as a market center for trade between Turkic nomads and the settled [[Sogdian people|Sogdians]]. It was destroyed several times: by [[Genghis Khan]], soldiers from the southern Khanates, and by nomad attacks. In the early 19th century, it became part of the [[Kokand Khanate|khanate of Kokand]] before it [[Russian conquest of Central Asia|was captured by the Russians]] in 1864.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Shymkent|title=Shymkent &#124; Kazakhstan|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> It was renamed [[Chernyaev]] in 1914 and renamed ''Chimkent'' in 1924. Following the Russian conquest, Chimkent was a city of trade between nomadic Turks and sedentary Turks, and was famous for its [[kumis]].<ref>Through Russian central Asia. By Stephen Graham. Published by The Macmillan Company, 1916</ref>
Chimkent was founded as a hub for economic development in South Kazakhstan in the 20th century, and rapid growth was evolving in the second half of the century. To date, there are about 70 factories, plants and other manufacturing companies in the area.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Shymkent|url=https://samarkandtours.com/kazakhstan/shymkent/|access-date=April 12, 2021}}</ref> A settlement on the territory of modern Chimkent already existed at the turn of the 11th – 12th centuries and it belonged to Uzbeks. At the same time, there is a hypothesis about its earlier establishment based on the burials found during archaeological excavations that, according to experts, date back to the 5th – 6th centuries. In the sources that have reached our time, the Central Asian historian Sharaf ad-din Yazdi (1425) first mentioned Chimkent in the book Zafar Name (Book of Victories), when describing the military campaigns of Timur. Chimkent (Shymkent), as a city-settlement already existed in the 6th century AD. Its name links to the famous traveler Xuan Jiang, who mentioned it in his notes about Isfijab - Sairam. It is widely believed that the city existed in the 12th century. This information is taken from the book of A. Dobrosmyslov "Cities of the Syr-Darya region", where he reports the following: "The name of the city of Chimkent comes from the words chim - sod and kent - city. Indigenous people of Chimkent relate the time of its establishment to the 12th century, referring to the grave of St. Baba Dervish, a contemporary of Khoja Ahmet Yasawi."

In 1914, in honour of the 50th anniversary of Chimkent becoming part of the Russian Empire, the city was named Chernyaev, but in 1924 the Soviet authorities returned to the city its former name.
A lead plant was built in Chimkent in the 1930s. It accounted for 70% of the total lead produced in the Soviet Union. An oil and fat plant, a hosiery and a mirror factory were commissioned. In 1932, an agricultural aviation base was created, which led to the creation and development of the city airport. During the Second World War, a number of Soviet industrial enterprises were evacuated in Chimkent. From the front line, 17 plants and factories were relocated here. The city produced spare parts for tanks, shells, metal, lead for bullets, optical instruments and other products. Seven Chimkent residents were awarded the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union.
There was a [[gulag]] near Chimkent, and as a result, many Russian-speaking people came to the area through imprisonment in that gulag.<ref>The Gulag Archipelago, 1918–1956: an experiment in literary investigation. By Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn, H. T. Willetts, Thomas P. Whitney. Published by Westview Press, 1997</ref> In January 2015, Shymkent officials sent a request to [[UNESCO]] to be recognized as an ancient city.<ref name=Shymkent>{{cite web|title=Shymkent Seeks UNESCO Recognition As 2,200-Year-Old City|url=http://www.astanatimes.com/2015/01/shymkent-seeks-unesco-recognition-2200-year-old-city/|website=www.astanatimes.com|date=27 January 2015}}</ref>
Until 2018, Shymkent was the administrative center of [[Turkistan Region|South Kazakhstan Region]]. On 19 June 2018 it was taken out of South Kazakhstan Region and subordinated directly to the government of Kazakhstan. As a result, the administrative center of the region is moved to [[Turkistan (city)|Turkistan]], and the region was renamed as Turkistan Region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akorda.kz/ru/events/akorda_news/akorda_other_events/publichnoe-podpisanie-ukaza-o-nekotoryh-voprosah-administrativno-territorialnogo-ustroistva-respubliki-kazahstan|title=Публичное подписание Указа "О некоторых вопросах административно-территориального устройства Республики Казахстан"|date=19 June 2018|publisher=President of Kazakhstan|language=ru|access-date=21 June 2018}}</ref>

== Region and development ==

On 19 June 2018 by the decree of the President of Kazakhstan, Shymkent was recognized as one of Kazakhstan's cities with a population of over a million people, along with the capital, [[Astana]], and [[Almaty]]. Shymkent was given the status of a city of republican significance. It was removed from the South Kazakhstan region, which was renamed [[Turkistan Region|Turkestan]] by the same decree. The city of Shymkent became an independent administrative-territorial unit, and the 17th region in Kazakhstan.<ref>{{cite web |title=RK President signed decree making Shymkent a city of republican significance |url=https://www.kazpravda.kz/en/news/president/rk-president-signed-decree-making-shymkent-a-city-of-republican-significance |website=Kazpravda |access-date=9 October 2020}}</ref>

In 2016, construction began on Shymkent City, a new district comprising residential and administrative areas, in the northern part of the city. This construction is part of then-President of Kazakhstan [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]]'s promotion of the development of Shymkent as the "third Kazakhstani megalopolis".<ref>{{cite web |title=S Kazakhstan rgn began construction of "Shymkent City" |url=https://strategy2050.kz/en/news/36045/ |website=Strategy2050.kz |access-date=9 October 2020}}</ref>
==Economy==
Formerly dominated by [[lead]] mining, industrial growth began in the 1930s.
A lead smelter was opened in Shymkent in 1934<ref name=AlJ>People & Power (TV programme), Al Jazeeera English, Robin Forestier, 20 February 2014</ref> or 1938.<ref>The USSR. By John C. Dewdney. Published by Dawson, 1976</ref> It supplied a major part of the USSR's metals needs, copper as well as lead and others, including three-quarters of all bullets fired by the Red Army. Smelting continued until 2008, causing extreme levels of pollution (lead, cadmium, etc.) in the surrounding ground, and then controversially restarted in 2010, briefly, under a major UK-listed company, [[Kazakhmys]].<ref name=AlJ/>
The city also has industries producing refined [[zinc]], processed [[Karakul (sheep)|karakul]] pelts, textiles, foodstuffs, and pharmaceuticals. Also, the city has a medium-sized refinery that is owned and operated by [[PetroKazakhstan]].
Shymkent is one of the leading industrial and economic centres of Kazakhstan. The city has industrial enterprises of non-ferrous metallurgy, mechanical engineering, chemical, oil refining and food industries.
The petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries include "PetroKazakhstan Oil Products" LLP (oil refining), "Khimpharm" JSC (medicines). Metallurgical goods are produced by "Yuzhpolymetal" JSC (lead and other products).

=== Streets ===
Before 1864, the city consisted of a chaotic interweaving of winding streets around the citadel of the ancient city of Shymkent (the so-called "Old City"). But after it became a town of the Syrdarya region in 1867, the "New City" gradually emerged - an area that has a rectangular-quarter street layout. It was limited to Nikolaevskaya (now Kazybek-bi), Stepnaya (Kunaev Boulevard), Sadovaya (Tauke Khan Avenue) and Meshchanskaya (now Turkestan) streets.

'''Ordabasy Square'''
{{Main|Al Farabi Square}}
In the 19th century, the eastern border of the city passed here, and there were also fortified gates leading to [[Sayram (city)|Sayram]] and [[Taraz]]. In those days, there was a [[bazaar]] nearby, therefore this square was called Bazaar; the street got the same name, which originated from this square.

Currently, three streets converge on the Ordabasy Square, named after three Kazakh wise men - Tole Bi, Kazybek Bi, Aiteke Bi. The monument ''Zher-ana'' was erected right in the center of the square. It has three faces with a height of 34 meters. Famous quotes of the three wise Kazakh men are carved on each face of the monument. The top of the monument is crowned by the figure of a young woman, symbolizing Mother Earth, who releases seven swallows into the sky.
Under the square flows the Koshkar Ata river and the square contains two fountains next to the monument.
The Ordabasy Square connects to the [[Independence Park (Shymkent)|Independence Park]] through a 104-meter-long pedestrian bridge.
=== Parks ===
'''Ken Baba Park'''
This park (formerly the Cathedral Garden, Nikolsky Church Park, and Children's Park) is one of the oldest in the city, located on Kazybek Bi Street at the intersection with Tauke Khan Avenue. In 1908, St. Nicholas Cathedral was built in the area by the architect Matsevich, which opened in the autumn of 1914. This three-story building is considered one of the best examples of religious construction in the "red brick style." In the Soviet years, it was transformed into a regional library, and later into the Palace of Pioneers. Now it is the regional [[Puppetry|puppet theatre]].

Valuable trees (mainly oaks) planted here in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and still grow in the park. Currently, there are numerous children's attractions and catering establishments. The water of the spring source is sent to artificial waterfalls that flow into decorative ponds, then the water is redistributed through the channels. Waterfowl and decorative fish can be spotted in the water.

'''Central Park'''

This park (formerly the Public City Garden) is also located on Kazybek Bi Street near Ken Baba Park. It was built at the end of the 19th century, almost simultaneously with the Cathedral Garden.

'''Dendropark'''

The Dendropark was built in 1980 at the outskirts of the city. Because of the fast growth of the city it is now inside of the city and located at the Prospekt Baydibek Bi. The park cover a area of 150 ha and there are about half of million trees and shrubs of 1360 different types. Most of them are rare and exotic types from different regions of the world.

'''Koshkar Ata mosque'''

The ''Koshkar Ata [[mosque]]'' also known as ''Zhami Mosque'' was built in 1850–1856. It was erected by [[Ferghana]] masters in the style of quarterly mosques of frontal composition. Initially, the building was built of mud brick, but due to flooding by the river, it collapsed over time. Therefore, in 1891–1893 the mosque was rebuilt with burnt bricks. The main facade was made in the form of a three-arch structure, the building had a right and left wing. In 2009, the left wing was destroyed despite the fact that the mosque is protected by law as a monument of architecture.

'''Old city'''

The old city began to appear thanks to artisans and farmers who began to settle at the foot of the citadel of the ancient city of Shymkent in the 16th century.

Today, the streets of the Old City follow the outlines of the streets of past centuries. But only two architectural objects of the century before last have survived - the Koshkar Ata mosque and the house of the district chief. In the late period of the Soviet Union, a plan was created to preserve the Old City as an open-air museum with special requirements for newly erected buildings to combine the historical and modern architectural style. After the fall of the Soviet Union the plans were not realized.
