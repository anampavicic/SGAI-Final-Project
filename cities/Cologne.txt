'''Cologne''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|l|oʊ|n|audio=Cologne.ogg}} {{respell|kə|LOHN}}; {{langx|de|link=no|Köln}} {{IPA|de|kœln||Köln Aussprache.ogg}}; {{langx|ksh|Kölle}} {{IPA-ksh|ˈkœlə||Koelle.ogg}}) is the largest city of the German [[States of Germany|state]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and the [[List of cities in Germany by population|fourth-most populous city]] of Germany with nearly 1.1&nbsp;million inhabitants in the city proper and over 3.1 million people in the [[Cologne Bonn Region|Cologne Bonn urban region]]. Cologne is also part of the [[Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region]], the [[List of EU metropolitan areas by GDP|second biggest metropolitan region by GDP]] in the European Union. Centered on the [[left bank of the Rhine|left (west) bank of the Rhine]], Cologne is located on the River [[Rhine]] ([[Lower Rhine]]), about {{convert|35|km|sp=us|abbr=on}} southeast of the North Rhine-Westphalia state capital [[Düsseldorf]] and {{convert|25|km|sp=us|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Bonn]], the former capital of [[West Germany]].

The city's medieval [[Cologne Cathedral]] ({{lang|de|Kölner Dom}}) was the [[History of the world's tallest buildings#Churches and cathedrals: Tallest buildings between the 13th and 20th century|world's tallest building 1880–1890]] and is today the [[List of tallest church buildings|third-tallest church and tallest cathedral in the world]]. It was constructed to house the [[Shrine of the Three Kings]] and is a globally recognized landmark and one of the most visited sights and pilgrimage destinations in Europe. The cityscape is further shaped by the [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne]]. Cologne is famous for [[Eau de Cologne]], which has been produced in the city since 1709; "cologne" has since come to be a generic term.

Cologne was founded and established in Germanic [[Ubii]] territory in the 1st century&nbsp;CE as the Roman {{lang|la|[[Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium|Colonia Agrippina]]}}, hence its name.<ref name="Cologne History">{{cite web |title= From Ubii village to metropolis |url= http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/history/from_ubii_village_metropolis |publisher= City of Cologne |archive-date= 17 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417171004/http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/history/from_ubii_village_metropolis}}</ref> {{lang|la|Agrippina}} was later dropped (except in Latin), and {{lang|la|Colonia}} became the name of the city in its own right, which developed into modern German as {{lang|de|Köln}}. {{lang|fr|Cologne}}, the French version of the city's name, has become standard in English as well. Cologne functioned as the capital of the Roman province of {{lang|la|[[Germania Inferior]]}} and as the headquarters of the Roman military in the region until occupied by the [[Ripuarian Franks|Franks]] in 462. During the [[Middle Ages]] the city flourished as being located on one of the most important major [[trade routes]] between east and western Europe (including the [[Brabant Road]], [[Via Regia]] and Publica). Cologne was a [[free imperial city]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and one of the major members of the trade union [[Hanseatic League]]. It was one of the largest European cities in medieval and renaissance times.

Prior to [[World War II]], the city had undergone occupations by the French (1794–1815) and the British (1918–1926), and was part of [[Prussia]] beginning in 1815. Cologne was one of the most [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|heavily bombed]] cities in Germany during World War&nbsp;II.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1945/1945%20-%201571.html|title= bomber command – mines laid – flight august – 1946 – 1571 – Flight Archive|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190704161459/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1945/1945%20-%201571.html|archive-date= 4 July 2019}}</ref> The bombing reduced the population by 93% mainly due to evacuation, and destroyed around 80% of the millennia-old city center. The post-war rebuilding has resulted in a mixed cityscape, restoring most major historic landmarks like city gates and churches (31 of them being [[Förderverein Romanische Kirchen Köln|Romanesque]]). The city nowadays consists of around 25% pre World War II buildings and boasts around 9,000 historic buildings.<ref name="zensus2011_de">https://zensus2011.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/Aufsaetze_Archiv/2015_12_NI_GWZ_endgueltig.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4 {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.offenedaten-koeln.de/anfragen/denkmalliste |title=Denkmalliste |language=de |trans-title=List of monuments |website=Offene Daten Köln |access-date=28 December 2023}}</ref>

Roman imperial governors resided in the city and it became one of the most important trade and production centers in the Roman Empire north of the Alps.<ref name="Cologne History"/> Cologne is shown on the 4th century [[Peutinger Map]].

Maternus, who was elected as bishop in 313, was the first known bishop of Cologne. The city was the capital of a Roman province until it was occupied by the [[Ripuarian Franks]] in 462. Parts of the original Roman sewers are preserved underneath the city, with the [[Cologne sewerage system|new sewerage system]] having opened in 1890.

After the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|Siege of Jerusalem]] and the associated [[Jewish diaspora|dispersion (diaspora) of the Jews]], there is evidence of a Jewish community in Cologne. In 321 CE, Emperor Constantine approved the settlement of a Jewish community with all the freedoms of Roman citizens. It is assumed that it was located near the Marspforte within the city wall. The Edict of Constantine to the Jews is the oldest documented evidence in Germany.<ref>Werner Eck: Köln in römischer Zeit. Geschichte einer Stadt im Rahmen des Imperium Romanum.

===Middle Ages===
Early medieval Cologne was part of [[Austrasia]] within the [[Frankish Empire]]. Cunibert, made bishop of Cologne in 623, was an important advisor to the Merovingian King Dagobert I and served with domesticus Pepin of Landen as tutor to the king's son and heir Siegebert III, the future king of Austrasia. In 716, [[Charles Martel]] commanded an army for the first time and suffered the only defeat of his life when [[Chilperic II]], King of [[Neustria]], invaded Austrasia and the city fell to him in the [[Battle of Cologne]]. Charles fled to the [[Eifel]] mountains, rallied supporters and took the city back that same year after defeating Chilperic in the [[Battle of Amblève]]. Cologne had been the seat of a bishop since the Roman period; under [[Charlemagne]], in 795, bishop [[Hildebold]] was promoted to [[archbishop]].<ref name="Cologne History"/> In the 843 [[Treaty of Verdun]] Cologne fell into the dominion of [[Lothair I]]'s [[Middle Francia]] – later called [[Lotharingia]] ([[Lower Lorraine]]).

In 953, the archbishops of Cologne first gained noteworthy secular power when bishop [[Bruno I, Archbishop of Cologne|Bruno]] was appointed as duke by his brother [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], [[Kingdom of Germany|King of Germany]].<ref name="Morley-1856">{{Cite book |last=Morley |first=Henry |url=http://archive.org/details/corneliusagripp03morlgoog |title=Cornelius Agrippa: The Life of Henry Cornelius Agrippa Von Nettesheim |date=1856 |publisher=Chapman and Hall |others=New York Public Library |pages=4–6 |language=English |chapter=Born in Cologne}}</ref> In order to weaken the secular nobility, who threatened his power, Otto endowed Bruno and his archiepiscopal successors with the prerogatives of secular princes, thus establishing the [[Electorate of Cologne]], formed by the temporal possessions of the archbishopric and included in the end a strip of territory along the left Bank of the Rhine east of [[Jülich]], as well as the [[Duchy of Westphalia]] on the other side of the Rhine, beyond [[Berg (state)|Berg]] and [[County of Mark|Mark]]. By the end of the 12th century, the Archbishop of Cologne was one of the seven electors of the Holy Roman Emperor. Besides being prince elector, he was [[Archchancellor]] of Italy as well, technically from 1238 and permanently from 1263 until 1803.

Following the [[Battle of Worringen]] in 1288, Cologne gained its independence from the archbishops and became a [[Free Imperial City|Free City]]. Archbishop [[Sigfried II von Westerburg]] was forced to reside in [[Bonn]].<ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia">Harry de Quetteville. "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04116a.htm History of Cologne] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805024052/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04116a.htm |date=5 August 2011 }}". ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', 28 November 2009.</ref> The archbishop nevertheless preserved the right of capital punishment. Thus the municipal council (though in strict political opposition towards the archbishop) depended upon him in all matters concerning criminal justice. This included torture, the sentence for which was only allowed to be handed down by the episcopal judge known as the greve. This legal situation lasted until the French conquest of Cologne.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Besides its economic and political significance Cologne also became an important centre of medieval pilgrimage, when Cologne's archbishop, [[Rainald of Dassel]], gave the relics of the [[Three Wise Men]] to Cologne's cathedral in 1164 (after they had been taken from [[Milan]]). Besides the three magi Cologne preserves the relics of [[Saint Ursula]] and [[Albertus Magnus]].<ref>Joseph P. Huffman, ''Family, Commerce, and Religion in London and Cologne'' (1998) covers from 1000 to 1300.</ref>

Cologne's location on the river Rhine placed it at the intersection of the major [[trade route]]s between east and west as well as the main south–north Western Europe trade route, Venice to Netherlands; even by the mid-10th century, merchants in the town were already known for their prosperity and luxurious standard of living due to the availability of trade opportunities.<ref name="Morley-1856" /> The intersection of these trade routes was the basis of Cologne's growth. By the end of the 12th century, Archbishop [[Phillip von Heinsberg]] enclosed the entire city with [[Defensive wall|walls]].<ref name="Morley-1856" /> By 1300 the city population was 50,000–55,000.<ref>''The Population of European Cities'', Bairoch</ref> Cologne was a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] in 1475, when [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] confirmed the city's imperial immediacy.<ref name="Cologne History"/> Cologne was so influential in regional commerce that its systems of weights and measurements (e.g. the [[Cologne mark]]) were used throughout Europe.<ref name="Morley-1856" />

[[File:Rekonstruktion der Stadt Köln im 17. Jahrhundert.webm|thumb|Reconstruction of Cologne in the 17th century (German, English subtitles available)]]
The economic structures of medieval and early modern Cologne were characterised by the city's status as a major harbour and transport hub on the Rhine. Craftsmanship was organised by self-administering guilds, some of which were exclusive to women.

As a [[free imperial city]], Cologne was a self-ruling state within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], an [[imperial estate]] with seat and vote at the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]], and as such had the right (and obligation) to contribute to the defense of the Empire and maintain its own military force. As they wore a red uniform, these troops were known as the ''Rote Funken'' (red sparks). These soldiers were part of the Army of the Holy Roman Empire ("Reichskontingent"). They fought in the wars of the 17th and 18th century, including the wars against revolutionary France in which the small force was almost completely wiped out in combat. The tradition of these troops is preserved as a military persiflage by Cologne's most outstanding carnival society, the ''Rote Funken''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rote-funken.de/ |title=Rote Funken – Kölsche Funke rut-wieß vun 1823 e.V. – Rote Funken Koeln |publisher=Rote-funken.de |access-date=5 May 2009 |archive-date=12 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412051505/http://www.rote-funken.de/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Free Imperial City of Cologne must not be confused with the [[Electorate of Cologne]], which was a state of its own within the Holy Roman Empire. Since the second half of the 16th century the majority of archbishops were drawn from the Bavarian [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach dynasty]]. Due to the free status of Cologne, the archbishops were usually not allowed to enter the city. Thus they took up residence in [[Bonn]] and later in [[Brühl, North Rhine-Westphalia|Brühl]] on the Rhine. As members of an influential and powerful family, and supported by their outstanding status as [[Prince-elector|electors]], the archbishops of Cologne repeatedly challenged and threatened the free status of Cologne during the 17th and 18th centuries, resulting in complicated affairs, which were handled by diplomatic means and propaganda as well as by the supreme courts of the Holy Roman Empire.

===From the 19th century until World War I===

[[File:Hängebrücke - Köln (1).tif|thumb|Hanging bridge]]
Cologne lost its status as a [[Free Imperial City|free city]] during the French period. According to the [[Treaty of Lunéville]] (1801) all the territories of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] on the left bank of the Rhine were officially incorporated into the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] (which had already occupied Cologne in 1794). Thus this region later became part of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] Empire. Cologne was part of the French [[Department (administrative division)|Département]] [[Roer (department)|Roer]] (named after the river Roer, German: [[Rur]]) with [[Aachen]] (French: Aix-la-Chapelle) as its capital. The French modernised public life, for example by introducing the [[Napoleonic code]] and removing the old elites from power. The Napoleonic code remained in use on the left bank of the Rhine until 1900, when a unified civil code (the ''[[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'') was introduced in the [[German Empire]]. In 1815 at the [[Congress of Vienna]], Cologne was made part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], first in the [[Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg]] and then the [[Rhine Province]].

The permanent tensions between the Catholic [[Rhineland]] and the overwhelmingly Protestant Prussian state repeatedly escalated with Cologne being in the focus of the conflict. In 1837 the archbishop of Cologne, [[Clemens August von Droste-Vischering]], was arrested and imprisoned for two years after a dispute over the legal status of marriages between Catholics and Protestants (''Mischehenstreit''). In 1874, during the [[Kulturkampf]], Archbishop [[Paul Melchers]] was imprisoned before taking asylum in the Netherlands. These conflicts alienated the Catholic population from Berlin and contributed to a deeply felt anti-Prussian resentment, which was still significant after World War II, when the former mayor of Cologne, [[Konrad Adenauer]], became the first West German chancellor.

During the 19th and 20th centuries, Cologne absorbed numerous surrounding towns, and by World War&nbsp;I had already grown to 700,000 inhabitants. Industrialisation changed the city and spurred its growth. Vehicle and engine manufacturing was especially successful, though the heavy industry was less ubiquitous than in the [[Ruhr area]]. The [[Cologne Cathedral|cathedral]], started in 1248 but abandoned around 1560, was eventually finished in 1880 not just as a place of worship but also as a German national monument celebrating the newly founded [[German empire]] and the continuity of the German nation since the Middle Ages. Some of this urban growth occurred at the expense of the city's historic heritage with much being demolished (for example, the city walls or the area around the cathedral) and sometimes replaced by contemporary buildings.

Cologne was designated as one of the [[Fortresses of the German Confederation]].<ref name=USM>[https://books.google.com/books?id=B77POH6Wgk4C&dq=%22Federal+Fortress+on+the+Upper+Rhine%22&pg=PA254 United Services Magazine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230503065948/https://books.google.com/books?id=B77POH6Wgk4C&dq=%22Federal+Fortress+on+the+Upper+Rhine%22&pg=PA254 |date=3 May 2023 }}, December 1835</ref> It was turned into a heavily armed fortress (opposing the French and Belgian fortresses of [[Verdun]] and [[Liège]]) with two fortified belts surrounding the city, the remains of which can be seen to this day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.altearmee.de/zwischenwerk/index.htm |title=Festung Köln |access-date=1 April 2011 |archive-date=11 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811112103/http://www.altearmee.de/zwischenwerk/index.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> The military demands on what became Germany's largest fortress presented a significant obstacle to urban development, with forts, bunkers, and wide defensive dugouts completely encircling the city and preventing expansion; this resulted in a very densely built-up area within the city itself.

During [[World War&nbsp;I]] Cologne was the target of several minor air raids but suffered no significant damage. Cologne was occupied by the [[British Army of the Rhine]] until 1926, under the terms of the Armistice and the subsequent [[Peace Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Peace Treaty]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080524105305/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,721598,00.html Cologne Evacuated], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 15 February 1926</ref> In contrast with the harsh behaviour of the French occupation troops in Germany, the British forces were more lenient to the local population. [[Konrad Adenauer]], the mayor of Cologne from 1917 until 1933 and later a West German chancellor, acknowledged the political impact of this approach, especially since Britain had opposed French demands for a permanent Allied occupation of the entire Rhineland.

As part of the demilitarisation of the [[Rhineland]], the city's fortifications had to be dismantled. This was an opportunity to create two green belts (''Grüngürtel'') around the city by converting the fortifications and their fields of fire into large public parks. This was not completed until 1933. In 1919 the [[University of Cologne]], closed by the French in 1798, was reopened. This was considered to be a replacement for the loss of the [[University of Strasbourg]] on the west bank of the Rhine, which reverted to France with the rest of [[Alsace]]. Cologne prospered during the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919–33), and progress was made especially in public governance, city planning, housing and social affairs. Social housing projects were considered exemplary and were copied by other German cities. Cologne competed to host the Olympics, and a modern sports stadium was erected at Müngersdorf. When the British occupation ended, the prohibition of civil aviation was lifted and [[Cologne Butzweilerhof Airport]] soon became a hub for national and international air traffic, second in Germany only to [[Tempelhof International Airport|Berlin Tempelhof Airport]].

The democratic parties lost the local elections in Cologne in March 1933 to the [[Nazi Party]] and other extreme-right parties. The Nazis then arrested the [[KPD|Communist]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] members of the city assembly, and Mayor Adenauer was dismissed. Compared to some other major cities, however, the Nazis never gained decisive support in Cologne. (Significantly, the number of votes cast for the Nazi Party in [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] elections had always been the national average.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weimarer-wahlen.de/de/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211085633/http://weimarer-wahlen.de/de/index.html |archive-date=11 February 2008 |title=Weimarer Wahlen |date=11 February 2008 |access-date=24 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wahlen-in-deutschland.de/wrtwkoelnaachen.htm |title=Voting results 1919–1933 Cologne-Aachen |publisher=Wahlen-in-deutschland.de |access-date=8 August 2010 |archive-date=19 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719113427/http://www.wahlen-in-deutschland.de/wrtwkoelnaachen.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> By 1939, the population had risen to 772,221 inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite web |title=NS-Dokumentationszentrum Köln - During the war |url=https://museenkoeln.de/NS-DOKUMENTAtionszentrum/default.aspx?s=784#:~:text=At%20a%20census%20in%20March,people%20were%20registered%20in%20Cologne. |access-date=2024-06-06 |website=museenkoeln.de |publisher=NS-Documentation Center of the City of Cologne}}</ref>

===World War II===
[[File:Koeln 1945.jpg|thumb|The devastation of Cologne, 1945]]
During World War II, Cologne was a Military Area Command Headquarters ({{lang|de|Militärbereichshauptkommandoquartier}}) for [[Wehrkreis VI]] (headquartered at [[Münster]]). Cologne was under the command of Lieutenant-General Freiherr Roeder von Diersburg, who was responsible for military operations in [[Bonn]], [[Siegburg]], [[Aachen]], [[Jülich]], [[Düren]], and [[Monschau]]. Cologne was home to the 211th Infantry Regiment and the 26th Artillery Regiment.

The Allies dropped 44,923.2 tons of bombs on the city during World War II, destroying 61% of its built up area. During the [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II]], Cologne endured 262 air raids<ref>{{cite web |author=koelnarchitektur |url=http://www.koelnarchitektur.de/pages/de/home/news_archiv/823.htm |title=on the reconstruction of Cologne |publisher=Koelnarchitektur.de |date=15 July 2003 |access-date=24 July 2009 |archive-date=1 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220201103749/http://www.koelnarchitektur.de/pages/de/home/news_archiv/823.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> by the Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], which caused approximately 20,000 civilian casualties and almost completely wiped out the central part of the city. During the night of 31 May 1942, Cologne was the target of "[[Operation Millennium]]", the first 1,000 bomber raid by the [[Royal Air Force]] in World War&nbsp;II. 1,046 heavy bombers attacked their target with 1,455 tons of explosives, approximately two-thirds of which were incendiary.<ref>Tourtellot, Arthur B. et al.

===Post-war and Cold War eras===
[[File:Cologne by Sentinel-2, 2020-05-07.jpg|thumb|Cologne, seen from ESA Sentinel-2]]
Despite Cologne's status as the largest city in the region, nearby [[Düsseldorf]] was chosen as the political capital of the [[States of Germany|federated state]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. With [[Bonn]] being chosen as the provisional federal capital (''provisorische Bundeshauptstadt'') and seat of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany (then informally [[West Germany]]), Cologne benefited by being sandwiched between two important political centres. The city became–and still is–home to a number of federal agencies and organizations. After reunification in 1990, Berlin was made the capital of Germany.

In 1945 architect and urban planner [[Rudolf Schwarz (architect)|Rudolf Schwarz]] called Cologne the "world's greatest heap of rubble". Schwarz designed the master plan for reconstruction in 1947, which included the construction of several new thoroughfares through the city centre, especially the ''Nord-Süd-Fahrt'' ("North-South-Drive"). The master plan took into consideration the fact that even shortly after the war a large increase in automobile traffic could be anticipated. Plans for new roads had already, to a certain degree, evolved under the Nazi administration, but the actual construction became easier when most of the city centre was in ruins.

The destruction of 95% of the city centre, including the famous [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|Twelve Romanesque churches]] such as [[St. Gereon's Basilica|St.&nbsp;Gereon]], [[Great St. Martin Church|Great St.&nbsp;Martin]], [[St.&nbsp;Maria im Kapitol]] and several other monuments in World War&nbsp;II, meant a tremendous loss of cultural treasures. The rebuilding of those churches and other landmarks such as the Gürzenich event hall was not undisputed among leading architects and art historians at that time, but in most cases, civil intention prevailed. The reconstruction lasted until the 1990s, when the Romanesque church of [[St. Kunibert (Cologne)|St.&nbsp;Kunibert]] was finished.

In 1959, the city's population reached pre-war numbers again. It then grew steadily, exceeding 1&nbsp;million for about one year from 1975. It remained just below that until mid-2010, when it exceeded 1&nbsp;million again.

In the 1980s and 1990s Cologne's economy prospered for two main reasons. The first was the growth in the number of media companies, both in the private and public sectors; they are especially catered for in the newly developed Media Park, which creates a strong visual focal point in Cologne's city centre and includes the ''KölnTurm'', one of Cologne's most prominent high-rise buildings. The second was the permanent improvement of the diverse traffic infrastructure, which made Cologne one of the most easily accessible metropolitan areas in Central Europe.

Due to the economic success of the [[Cologne Trade Fair]], the city arranged a large extension to the fair site in 2005. At the same time the original buildings, which date back to the 1920s, were rented out to [[Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland|RTL]], Germany's largest private broadcaster, as their new corporate headquarters.

Cologne was the focus of the [[2015-16 New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany]], with over 500 women reporting that they were sexually assaulted by persons of African and Arab appearance.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/tensions-rise-in-germany-over-handling-of-mass-sexual-assaults-in-cologne|title=Tensions rise in Germany over handling of mass sexual assaults in Cologne|last=Connolly|first=Kate|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 January 2016|access-date=12 January 2016|archive-date=12 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112044027/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/tensions-rise-in-germany-over-handling-of-mass-sexual-assaults-in-cologne|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung-2016">{{cite web|url=https://www.derwesten.de/politik/1075-anzeigen-nach-koelner-silvesternacht-73-verdaechtige-id11567004.html|title=1075 Anzeigen nach Kölner Silvesternacht – 73 Verdächtige|trans-title=1,075 assaults by Cologne New Year's Eve – 73 suspects|work=[[Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=15 February 2016|language=de|access-date=15 February 2016|archive-date=16 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216101356/http://www.derwesten.de/politik/1075-anzeigen-nach-koelner-silvesternacht-73-verdaechtige-id11567004.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Climate===
Located in the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] area, Cologne is one of the warmest cities in Germany. It has a [[Temperateness|temperate]]–[[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen: ''Cfb'']]) with cool winters and warm summers. It is also one of the cloudiest cities in Germany, with just 1,567.5 hours of sun a year. Its average annual temperature is {{convert|10.7|°C|0|abbr=on}}: {{convert|15.4|°C|0|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|6.1|°C|0|abbr=on}} at night. In January, the mean temperature is {{convert|3.0|°C|0|abbr=on}}, while the mean temperature in July is {{convert|19.0|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The record high temperature of {{convert|40.3|°C|0|abbr=on}} happened on 25 July 2019 during the [[July 2019 European heat wave]] in which Cologne saw three consecutive days over {{convert|38.0|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Especially the inner urban neighbourhoods experience a greater number of hot days, as well as significantly higher temperatures during nighttime compared to the surrounding area (including the airport, where temperatures are classified).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dwd.de/DE/klimaumwelt/klimaforschung/klimawirk/stadtpl/stadtklimaprojekte/projekt_koeln/start_klima_koeln21.html|title=Wetter und Klima – Deutscher Wetterdienst – Stadtklima Köln – Klimawandelgerechte Metropole Köln – Strategie zur Anpassung an den Klimawandel (KÖLN_21)|website=www.dwd.de|access-date=20 January 2021|archive-date=4 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210604131150/https://www.dwd.de/DE/klimaumwelt/klimaforschung/klimawirk/stadtpl/stadtklimaprojekte/projekt_koeln/start_klima_koeln21.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Still temperatures can vary noticeably over the course of a month with warmer and colder weather. Precipitation is spread evenly throughout the year with a light peak in summer due to showers and thunderstorms.

==Government and politics==
{{See also|Cologne City Hall}}
The city's administration is headed by the [[List of mayors of Cologne|mayor]] and the three deputy mayors.

===Political traditions and developments===
The long tradition of a free imperial city, which long dominated an exclusively Catholic population and the age-old conflict between the church and the bourgeoisie (and within it between the patricians and craftsmen) have created its own political climate in Cologne. Various interest groups often form networks beyond party boundaries. The resulting web of relationships, with political, economic, and cultural links with each other in a system of mutual favours, obligations and dependencies, is called the 'Cologne coterie'. This has often led to an unusual proportional distribution in the city government and degenerated at times into corruption: in 1999, a "waste scandal" over kickbacks and illegal campaign contributions came to light, which led not only to the imprisonment of the entrepreneur Hellmut Trienekens, but also to the downfall of almost the entire leadership of the ruling Social Democrats.

==Cityscape==
{{wide image|Cologne - Panoramic Image of the old town at dusk.jpg|1000px|Panoramic view of the city at night as seen from [[Deutz, Cologne|Deutz]]; '''from left to right''': Deutz Bridge; [[Great St.&nbsp;Martin Church]]; [[Cologne Cathedral]]; and [[Hohenzollern Bridge]]}}

The inner city of Cologne was largely destroyed during World War&nbsp;II. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. Thus, the city centre today is characterized by [[modern architecture]], with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were [[reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructed]] due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the "Wiederaufbauzeit" (era of reconstruction), for example, the opera house by [[Wilhelm Riphahn]], are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Nevertheless, the uncompromising style of the [[Cologne Opera]] house and other modern buildings has remained controversial.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

The districts outside the city center consist mostly of 19th and 20th century buildings.<ref name="zensus2011_de" /> Around 25% of Cologne was built before 1945.<ref name="zensus2011_de" />

Green areas account for over a quarter of Cologne, which is approximately {{convert|75|m2|2|abbr=on}} of public green space for every inhabitant.<ref>{{cite web|title=Green Cologne|url=http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/exploring_city/green_cologne|publisher=KölnTourismus|access-date=17 April 2011|archive-date=18 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118104751/http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/exploring_city/green_cologne|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Wildlife==
The dominant wildlife of Cologne is insects, small rodents, and several species of birds. Pigeons are the most often seen animals in Cologne, although the number of birds is augmented each year by a growing population of [[Feral organism|feral]] exotics, most visibly parrots such as the [[rose-ringed parakeet]]. The sheltered climate in southeast [[Northrhine-Westphalia]] allows these birds to survive through the winter, and in some cases, they are displacing native species. The plumage of Cologne's green parrots is highly visible even from a distance, and contrasts starkly with the otherwise muted colours of the cityscape.<ref>{{cite web|title=In NRW behaupten sich immer mehr exotische Vögel|date=4 March 2007|url=http://www.rp-online.de/wissen/leben/in-nrw-behaupten-sich-immer-mehr-exotische-voegel-1.2313710|publisher=RP Online|access-date=16 January 2013|archive-date=17 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517180155/http://www.rp-online.de/wissen/leben/in-nrw-behaupten-sich-immer-mehr-exotische-voegel-1.2313710|url-status=live}}</ref>

Hedgehogs, rabbits and squirrels are common in parks and the greener parts of town. In the outer suburbs foxes and wild boar can be seen, even during the day.

==Tourism==
Cologne had 5.8&nbsp;million overnight stays booked and 3.35&nbsp;million arrivals in 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cologne-tourism.com/newsroom/press-releases/press-release/article/tourism-results-for-2016-moderate-decrease-in-visitor-numbers-due-to-difficult-general-conditions.html |title=Tourism results for 2016: Moderate decrease in visitor numbers due to difficult general conditions |publisher=KölnTourismus |date=21 February 2017 |access-date=13 September 2017 |archive-date=13 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913190906/https://www.cologne-tourism.com/newsroom/press-releases/press-release/article/tourism-results-for-2016-moderate-decrease-in-visitor-numbers-due-to-difficult-general-conditions.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Landmarks===

====Churches====
* [[Cologne Cathedral]] (German: ''Kölner Dom'') is the city's most famous monument and the Cologne residents' most loved landmark. It is a [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] church, started in 1248, and completed in 1880. In 1996, it was designated a [[World Heritage Site]]; it houses the [[Shrine of the Three Kings]], which supposedly contains the [[relic]]s of the [[Biblical Magi|Three Magi]] (see also<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.koelner-dom.de/index.php?id=dreikoenigenschrein |title=Offizielle Webseite des Kölner Doms &#124; Bedeutende Werke |publisher=Koelner-dom.de |access-date=5 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703064357/http://www.koelner-dom.de/index.php?id=dreikoenigenschrein |archive-date=3 July 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>). Residents of Cologne sometimes refer to the cathedral as "the eternal construction site" (''die ewige Baustelle'').
* [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|Twelve Romanesque churches]]: These buildings are outstanding examples of medieval church architecture. The origins of some of the churches go back as far as Roman times, for example St.&nbsp;Gereon, which was originally a chapel in a Roman graveyard. With the exception of St. Maria Lyskirchen all of these churches were very badly damaged during World War&nbsp;II. Reconstruction was only finished in the 1990s.

====Medieval houses====
The Cologne City Hall (''Kölner Rathaus''), founded in the 12th century, is the oldest [[city hall]] in Germany still in use.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cologne.strategicmanagement.net/tuesday.php |title=Strategic Management Society – Cologne Conference – Cologne Information |publisher=Cologne.strategicmanagement.net |date=14 October 2008 |access-date=26 July 2010 |archive-date=24 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724083513/http://cologne.strategicmanagement.net/tuesday.php |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Renaissance-style loggia and tower were added in the 15th century. Other famous buildings include the Gürzenich, Haus Saaleck and the Overstolzenhaus.

====Medieval city gates====

Of the twelve medieval [[city gate]]s that once existed, only the Eigelsteintorburg at Ebertplatz, the Hahnentor at Rudolfplatz and the Severinstorburg at Chlodwigplatz still stand today.

===Streets===
{{Main|Streets in Cologne}}
* The [[Cologne Ring]] boulevards (such as ''Hohenzollernring'', ''Kaiser-Wilhelm-Ring'', ''Hansaring'') with their medieval city gates (such as ''Hahnentorburg'' on ''Rudolfplatz'') are also known for their night life.
* [[Hohe Straße]] (literally: ''High Street'') is one of the main shopping areas and extends past the cathedral in an approximately southerly direction. The street contains many gift shops, clothing stores, fast food restaurants and electronic goods dealers.
* [[Schildergasse]] – connects ''Neumarkt'' square at its western end to the ''Hohe Strasse'' shopping street at its eastern end and has been named the busiest shopping street in Europe with 13,000 people passing through every hour, according to a 2008 study by [[GfK]].
* Ehrenstraße – the shopping area around ''Apostelnstrasse'', ''Ehrenstrasse'', and ''Rudolfplatz'' is a little more on the quirky and stylish side.

===Bridges===
[[File:Bridge in Cologne over the Rhine River.jpg|thumb|left |Bridge in Cologne over the Rhine River]] [[File:Rhine River at Cologne, Germany.jpg|thumb|right|Rhine River at Cologne]]
Several bridges cross the Rhine in Cologne. They are (from south to north): the [[Cologne Rodenkirchen Bridge|Rodenkirchen Bridge]], [[South Bridge (Cologne)|South Bridge]] (railway), {{ill|Severin Bridge|de|Severinsbrücke}}, [[Deutz Bridge]], [[Hohenzollern Bridge]] (railway), {{ill|Zoo Bridge|de|Zoobrücke}} (''Zoobrücke'') and [[Cologne Mülheim Bridge|Mülheim Bridge]]. In particular the iron [[tied arch bridge|tied arch]] Hohenzollern Bridge (''Hohenzollernbrücke'') is a dominant landmark along the river embankment. A Rhine crossing of a special kind is provided by the [[Cologne Cable Car]] (German: ''Kölner Seilbahn''), a cableway that runs across the river between the [[Cologne Zoological Garden]] in Riehl and the [[Rheinpark]] in Deutz.

===High-rise structures===
Cologne's tallest structure is the [[Colonius]] telecommunication tower at {{convert|266|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}. The observation deck has been closed since 1992. A selection of the tallest buildings in Cologne is listed below. Other tall structures include the Hansahochhaus (designed by architect Jacob Koerfer and completed in 1925 – it was at one time Europe's tallest office building), the Kranhaus buildings at [[Rheinauhafen]], and the [[Messeturm Köln]] ("trade fair tower").

Cologne has [[List of museums in Cologne|numerous museums]]. The famous [[Roman-Germanic Museum]] features art and architecture from the city's distant past; the [[Museum Ludwig]] houses one of the most important collections of [[modern art]] in Europe, including a [[Picasso]] collection matched only by the museums in [[Museu Picasso|Barcelona]] and [[Musée Picasso|Paris]]. The [[Museum Schnütgen]] of religious art is partly housed in St.&nbsp;Cecilia, one of Cologne's [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|Twelve Romanesque churches]]. Many art galleries in Cologne enjoy a worldwide reputation like e.g. [[Galerie Karsten Greve]], one of the leading galleries for postwar and contemporary art.

Cologne has more than 60 music venues and the third-highest density of music venues of Germany's four largest cities, after Munich and Hamburg and ahead of Berlin.<ref name="Faze Magazin-2021">{{Cite web |url=https://www.fazemag.de/clubstudie-2021-initiative-musik-legt-einzelauswertungen-der-bundeslaender-vor/ |title=Clubstudie 2021: Initiative Musik legt Einzelauswertungen der Bundesländer vor |trans-title=Club Study 2021: Initiative Musik presents individual evaluations of the German federal states |work=Faze Magazin |language=German |date=20 September 2021 |access-date=6 January 2022 |archive-date=3 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220103024902/https://www.fazemag.de/clubstudie-2021-initiative-musik-legt-einzelauswertungen-der-bundeslaender-vor/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="clubstudy_2021">{{Cite web |url=https://www.initiative-musik.de/clubstudie/clubstudie-bundeslaender |title=Clubstudie 2021: Einzelauswertungen der Bundesländer |trans-title=Club Study 2021: Individual evaluations of the German federal states |work=Initiative Musik |language=German |date=20 September 2021 |access-date=6 January 2022 |archive-date=3 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220103211440/https://www.initiative-musik.de/clubstudie/clubstudie-bundeslaender/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Several orchestras are active in the city, among them the [[Gürzenich Orchestra]], which is also the orchestra of the [[Cologne Opera]] and the [[WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne]] (''German State Radio Orchestra''), both based at the Cologne Philharmonic Orchestra Building ([[Kölner Philharmonie]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koelner-philharmonie.de/en/00_home/00_home.php?Style=eb281b060898acfab42beae0870f44f6  |title=Kölner Philharmonie |date=11 December 2007 |access-date=8 August 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071211142559/http://www.koelner-philharmonie.de/en/00_home/00_home.php?Style=eb281b060898acfab42beae0870f44f6 |archive-date = 11 December 2007}}</ref> Other orchestras are the [[Musica Antiqua Köln]], the [[WDR Rundfunkorchester Köln]] and [[WDR Big Band]], and several choirs, including the [[WDR Rundfunkchor Köln]]. Cologne was also an important hotbed for electronic music in the 1950s (Studio für elektronische Musik, [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]) and again from the 1990s onward. The public radio and TV station [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] was involved in promoting musical movements such as [[Krautrock]] in the 1970s; the influential [[Can (band)|Can]] was formed there in 1968. There are several centres of nightlife, among them the ''Kwartier Latäng'' (the student quarter around the Zülpicher Straße) and the nightclub-studded areas around [[Hohenzollernring]], Friesenplatz and Rudolfplatz.

The main literary figure connected with Cologne is the writer [[Heinrich Böll]], winner of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. Since 2012, there is also an annual international festival of philosophy called {{ill|phil.cologne|de}}.

The city also has the most pubs per capita in Germany.<ref name="Nightlife">{{cite web|title=Nightlife|url=http://www.cologne.de/what-to-do/nightlife|publisher=KölnTourismus|access-date=13 September 2017|archive-date=13 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913011256/http://www.cologne.de/what-to-do/nightlife|url-status=live}}</ref> Cologne is well known for its beer, called [[Kölsch (beer)|Kölsch]]. [[Colognian dialect|Kölsch]] is also the name of the local dialect. This has led to the common joke of Kölsch being the only language one can drink.

Cologne is also famous for [[Eau de Cologne]] (German: ''Kölnisch Wasser''; lit: "Water of Cologne"), a perfume created by Italian expatriate [[Johann Maria Farina]] at the beginning of the 18th century. During the 18th century, this perfume became increasingly popular, was exported all over Europe by the Farina family and ''Farina'' became a household name for ''Eau de Cologne''. In 1803 Wilhelm Mülhens entered into a contract with an unrelated person from Italy named Carlo Francesco Farina who granted him the right to use his family name and Mühlens opened a small factory at Cologne's Glockengasse. In later years, and after various court battles, his grandson [[Ferdinand Mülhens]] was forced to abandon the name ''Farina'' for the company and their product. He decided to use the house number given to the factory at Glockengasse during the French occupation in the early 19th century, [[4711 (brand)|4711]]. Today, original Eau de Cologne is still produced in Cologne by both the [[Johann Maria Farina gegenüber dem Jülichs-Platz|Farina family]], in the eighth generation, and by [[Mäurer & Wirtz]] who bought the 4711 brand in 2006.

===Carnival===
The [[Cologne carnival]] is one of the largest street festivals in Europe. In Cologne, the carnival season officially starts on 11 November at 11 minutes past 11&nbsp;a.m. with the proclamation of the new Carnival Season, and continues until [[Ash Wednesday]]. However, the so-called "Tolle Tage" (crazy days) do not start until ''Weiberfastnacht'' (Women's Carnival) or, in dialect, ''Wieverfastelovend'', the Thursday before Ash Wednesday, which is the beginning of the street carnival. Zülpicher Strasse and its surroundings, Neumarkt square, Heumarkt and all bars and pubs in the city are crowded with people in costumes dancing and drinking in the streets. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to Cologne during this time. Generally, around a million people celebrate in the streets on the Thursday before Ash Wednesday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stadt-koeln.de/en/koelntourismus/karneval/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125230206/http://www.stadt-koeln.de/en/koelntourismus/karneval/ |archive-date=25 January 2008 |title=Carnival – Cologne's "fifth season" – Cologne Sights & Events – Stadt Köln |date=26 January 2008 |access-date=24 July 2009}}</ref>

==Transport==
{{Main|Transport in Cologne}}

===Roads===
[[File:Koelner Ring.png|thumb|left|Major [[List of streets in Cologne|roads through and around Cologne]]]]
Road building had been a major issue in the 1920s under the leadership of mayor [[Konrad Adenauer]]. The first German limited-access road was constructed after 1929 between Cologne and [[Bonn]]. Today, this is the [[Bundesautobahn 555]]. In 1965, Cologne became the first German city to be fully encircled by a motorway ring road. Roughly at the same time, a city centre bypass (''Stadtautobahn'') was planned, but only partially put into effect, due to opposition by environmental groups. The completed section became ''Bundesstraße ("Federal Road") B 55a'', which begins at the ''Zoobrücke'' ("Zoo Bridge") and meets with [[Bundesautobahn 4|A&nbsp;4]] and [[Bundesautobahn 3|A&nbsp;3]] at the interchange Cologne East. Nevertheless, it is referred to as ''Stadtautobahn'' by most locals. In contrast to this, the ''Nord-Süd-Fahrt'' ("North-South-Drive") was actually completed, a new four/six-lane city centre through-route, which had already been anticipated by planners such as [[Fritz Schumacher (architect)|Fritz Schumacher]] in the 1920s. The last section south of ''Ebertplatz'' was completed in 1972.

In 2005, the first stretch of an eight-lane motorway in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] was opened to traffic on [[Bundesautobahn&nbsp;3]], part of the eastern section of the [[Cologne Beltway]] between the interchanges Cologne East and Heumar.

===Cycling===
Compared to other German cities, Cologne has a traffic layout that is not very [[bicycle-friendly]]. It has repeatedly ranked among the worst in an independent evaluation<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adfc.de/fahrradklima-test/adfc-startet-fahrradklima-test/adfc-fahrradklima-test-2014 |title=ADFC &#124; Wie fahrradfreundlich ist Ihre Stadt? |access-date=10 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304204535/http://www.adfc.de/fahrradklima-test/adfc-startet-fahrradklima-test/adfc-fahrradklima-test-2014 |archive-date=4 March 2015}}</ref> conducted by the [[Allgemeiner Deutscher Fahrrad-Club]].
