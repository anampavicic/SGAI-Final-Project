==History==
The area around Tajimi was part of traditional [[Mino Province]].  During the [[Edo period]], much of the area was ''[[tenryō]]'' territory under the direct control of [[Tokugawa shogunate]].  In the post-[[Meiji restoration]] cadastral reforms, [[Toki District, Gifu|Toki District]] in Gifu Prefecture was created, and the town of Tajimi was established on July 1, 1889 by the creation of the modern municipalities system. Tajimi annexed the town of Toyota from neighbouring Kani District in 1934, and was raised to city status on August 1, 1940.

Tajimi subsequently annexed the villages of Koizimi and Ikeda from Kani District in 1944, and the villages of Ichinokura and Kasahara from Toki District in 1951. On January 23, 2006 the town of [[Kasahara, Gifu|Kasahara]] (from [[Toki District, Gifu|Toki District]]) was merged into Tajimi.<ref name=tajimi>{{cite web|script-title=ja:多治見市と笠原町 合併の歩み|url=http://www.city.tajimi.gifu.jp/kasahara/sub/gappei.html|work=Tajimi official website|accessdate=August 20, 2011|language=Japanese|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927062045/http://www.city.tajimi.gifu.jp/kasahara/sub/gappei.html|archivedate=September 27, 2011}}</ref>

==Government==
[[File:Tajimi City Hall01.jpg|thumb|200px|Tajimi City Hall]]
Tajimi has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city legislature of 24 members.

==Economy==
Tajimi is traditionally known for ceramics, mostly ceramic tiles and tableware, although due to increasing competitive pressures, especially from imported sources, only a few producers remain within the city limits, and economic activity in ceramics is increasingly orientated towards trade and wholesaling.

==Education==
Tajimi has 13 public elementary schools and eight public middle schools operated by the city government and one private combined middle/high school. The city has three public high schools operated by the Gifu Prefectural Board of Education. The [[Nagoya Institute of Technology]] has a campus in Tajimi.
