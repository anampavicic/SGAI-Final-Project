'''Wasit Governorate''' ({{langx|ar|واسط|translit=Wāsit}}) is a [[Governorates of Iraq|governorate]] in eastern [[Iraq]], south-east of [[Baghdad]] and bordering [[Iran]]. Prior to 1976 it was known as Kut Province. Major cities include the capital [[Al Kut|Al-Kut]], [[Al-Hai]] and [[Al-Suwaira]]. The governorate contains the [[Mesopotamian Marshes]] of Shuwayja, Al-Attariyah, and Hor Aldelmj. Its name comes from the Arabic word meaning "middle", as the former city of [[Wasit, Iraq|Wasit]] lay along the [[Tigris]] about midway between Baghdad and [[Basra]]. Wasit city was abandoned after the Tigris shifted course.

==History==
{{Further|History of Sumer}}

The ancient [[Sumer]]ian city-state of [[Der (Sumer)|Der]] is located near the town of [[Badra, Iraq|Badra]].

The governorate experienced heavy fighting in the [[Iran–Iraq War]], specifically the [[Battle of the Marshes]].

During the [[Iraq spring fighting of 2004]], the [[Mahdi Army]] briefly took control of the capital Kut, from April 6 to April 16, before being defeated by [[Multi-National Force – Iraq|US forces.]]

==Demographics==
The population is approximately 1,450,000. The majority are [[Shia]] [[Arabs]]. The marshes have traditionally been home to many [[Marsh Arabs]]. There are also [[Feyli Kurds]] in the eastern town of [[Badra, Iraq|Badra]].  A small Feyli Kurd community exists east of Kut.<ref name=NCCIProfile />
