==History==
{{Original research section|date=November 2008}}

===Pre-1800===
The area was inhabited by the Temecula Indians for hundreds of years before their contact with the Spanish [[missionaries]] (the people are now generally known as the ''[[Luiseño people|Luiseños]]'', after the nearby [[Mission San Luis Rey de Francia]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fourdir.com/luiseno.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020415115900/http://www.fourdir.com/luiseno.htm|url-status=usurped|archive-date=April 15, 2002|title=FDI - Luiseno|website=Fourdir.com|access-date=August 31, 2017}}</ref> Seven bands of Luiseño Indians inhabited the Temecula valley pre-contact: the [[Pechanga Band of Luiseño Indians|Pechanga]], [[La Jolla Band of Luiseño Indians|La Jolla]], [[Soboba Band of Luiseño Indians|Soboba]], [[Pala Band of Luiseno Mission Indians|Pala]], [[Rincon Band of Luiseño Indians|Rincon]], [[Pauma Band of Luiseno Mission Indians|Pauma]], and San Luis Rey bands (presently, all of the bands except the San Luis Rey are [[List of federally recognized tribes by state|federally recognized tribes]]).<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=List of Federal and State Recognized Tribes|url=https://www.ncsl.org/legislators-staff/legislators/quad-caucus/list-of-federal-and-state-recognized-tribes.aspx#ca|access-date=December 9, 2021|website=www.ncsl.org}}</ref> The [[Pechanga Band of Luiseno Mission Indians|Pechanga Band]] of Luiseño believe their ancestors have lived in the Temecula area for more than 10,000 years, though ethnologists think they arrived at a more recent date.

===1800–1900===
Little is known about the early 1800s because Temecula records were destroyed in the fire that followed the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Temecula |url=https://www.temeculaca.gov/150/History-of-Temecula |website=The City of Temecula |publisher=Temecula.gov |access-date=December 12, 2021}}</ref>

In 1798, Spanish missionaries established the Mission of San Luis Rey de Francia and designated the Indians living in the region as "Sanluiseños", shortened to "Luiseños".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pechanga-nsn.gov/page?pageId=6|title=The Pechanga Band of Luiseño Indians|website=Pechanga-nsn.gov|access-date=August 31, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708141247/http://www.pechanga-nsn.gov/page?pageId=6|archive-date=July 8, 2007}}</ref> In the 1820s, the nearby [[Mission San Antonio de Pala]] was built.

The [[Ranchos of California|Mexican land grants]] made in the Temecula area were [[Rancho Temecula]], granted to Felix Valdez, and to the east [[Rancho Pauba]], granted to Vicente Moraga in 1844. [[Rancho Little Temecula]] was made in 1845 to Luiseño Pablo Apis, one of the few former mission converts to be given a land grant. It was fertile well watered land at the southern end of the valley, which included the village of Temecula.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/91fall/images/p260.gif|title=Map of the Apis Grant|website=Sandiegohistory.org|access-date=August 31, 2017}}</ref><ref>[https://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/91fall/temecula.htm Leland E.

On December 6, 1846, at the [[Battle of San Pasqual]], [[Andrés Pico]] led [[Californio]]s to kill over twenty of U.S. General [[Stephen W. Kearny]]'s men. Subsequently, in January 1847, José Lugo with [[Cahuilla]] Indians came to the [[Temecula Valley]] in pursuit of the [[Luiseño]] Indians and killed an unknown number, about 40-100 of them, reportedly, in the canyon just west of the current [[Vail Lake]] Dam.<ref>{{cite web |title=Temecula Massacre |url=https://www.temeculaca.gov/155/Temecula-Massacre  |website=The City of Temecula |publisher=Temecula.gov |access-date=December 12, 2021}}</ref>

As American settlers moved into the area after the war, conflict with the native tribes increased. A [[Outline of United States federal Indian law and policy#treaties|treaty]] was signed in the Magee Store in Temecula in 1852, but was never ratified by the [[United States Senate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol4/html_files/v4p1124.html|title=INDIAN AFFAIRS: LAWS AND TREATIES.

On November 15, 1853, the commission rejected the Luiseño claim; an appeal in 1856 to the district court was found to be in favor of the heirs of Pablo Apis (he had died in late 1853 or early 1854). The Luiseño of Temecula village remained on the south side of Temecula Creek when the Apis grant was acquired by Louis Wolf in 1872; they were evicted in 1875.<ref>[https://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/74winter/temecula.htm Kurt Van Horn, ''Tempting Temecula, The Making and Unmaking of a Southern California Community'', ''The Journal of San Diego History'', Winter 1974, Volume 20, Number 1.]</ref>

A [[stagecoach]] line started a local route from Warner Ranch to [[Colton, California|Colton]] in 1857 that passed through the Temecula Valley. Within a year, the [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] stagecoach line, with a route between [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and San Francisco, stopped at Temecula's Magee Store.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Barnett|first=Loretta, and Rebecca Farnbach.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N3YdIVn87xgC&dq=overland+trail+Temecula%27s+Magee+Store&pg=PA6|title=Temecula|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|year=2006|isbn=0738530956|location=San Francisco|pages=18}}</ref> On April 22, 1859, the first inland Southern California post office was established in Temecula in the Magee Store. This was the second post office in the state, the first being located in San Francisco. The Temecula post office was moved in the ensuing years; its present locations are the seventh and eighth sites occupied. The [[American Civil War]] put an end to the Butterfield Overland Stage Service, but stage service continued on the route under other stage companies until the railroad reached Fort Yuma in 1877.<ref>[http://www.temeculahistoricalsociety.org/temeculahistory.html "Temecula History" A Short History of Temecula, California] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514230400/http://www.temeculahistoricalsociety.org/temeculahistory.html |date=May 14, 2011 }}, Courtesy of the Temecula Valley Museum</ref>

In 1862, Louis Wolf, a Temecula merchant and postmaster, married Ramona Place, who was mixed-race and half Indian. Author [[Helen Hunt Jackson]] spent time with Louis and Ramona Wolf in 1882 and again in 1883. Wolf's store became an inspiration for Jackson's fictional "Hartsel's store" in her 1884 novel, ''[[Ramona]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author = Jackson, Helen Hunt|url= http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/ramona-text.htm|title=Ramona|publisher=Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society|access-date=July 4, 2004}}</ref>

In 1882, the United States government established the Pechanga Indian Reservation of approximately {{convert|4000|acre|km2|0}} some {{convert|6|mi}} from downtown Temecula. Also in 1882, the [[California Southern Railroad]], a subsidiary of the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe Railroad]], completed construction of the section from [[National City, California|National City]] to Temecula. In 1883, the line was extended to [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]]. In the late 1880s, a series of floods washed out the tracks and the section of the railroad through the canyon was finally abandoned. The old Temecula station was used as a barn and later demolished.

In the 1890s, with the operation of [[granite]] stone quarries, Temecula granite was shaped into fence and hitching posts, curbstones, courthouse steps, and building blocks. At the turn of the 20th century, Temecula became an important shipping point for grain and cattle.

===1900–1989===
[[File:Temecula-1909.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Temecula, 1909]]
In 1904, [[Walter Vail]], who had come to the United States with his parents from [[Nova Scotia]], migrated to California. Along with various partners, he began buying land in Southern California. Vail bought ranchland in the Temecula Valley, buying {{convert|38000|acre|km2|0}} of Rancho Temecula and Rancho Pauba, along with the northern half of Rancho Little Temecula. Vail was killed by a streetcar in Los Angeles in 1906; his son, Mahlon Vail, took over the family ranch. In 1914, financed by Mahlon Vail and local ranchers, the First National Bank of Temecula opened on Front Street. In 1915, the first paved, two-lane county road was built through Temecula.

By 1947, the Vail Ranch contained over {{convert|87500|acre|km2|0}}. In 1948, the Vail family built a dam to catch the [[Temecula Creek]] water and created [[Vail Lake]]. Through the mid-1960s, the economy of the Temecula Valley centered around the Vail Ranch; the cattle business and agriculture were the stimuli for most business ventures.

In 1964, the Vail Ranch was sold to the [[Kaiser Aluminum|Kaiser]]—[[Aetna]] partnership. A later purchase by the group brought the total area to {{convert|97500|acre|km2|0}}, and the area became known as Rancho California.

In the 1970 census, the [[United States Census Bureau]] [[census#Enumeration strategies|enumerated]] the population of the entire Murrieta-Rancho California-Temecula area at 2,769.

State Route 79 enters the Temecula area after passing Vail Lake, paralleling [[Temecula Creek]] for several miles, and it becomes a six-lane, city-maintained thoroughfare known as Temecula Parkway before it overlaps with Interstate 15. It leaves the freeway three miles later as Winchester Road (which is maintained by the city until it reaches the northern city limits) and continues north toward the cities of [[Hemet, California|Hemet]], [[San Jacinto, California|San Jacinto]], and [[Beaumont, California|Beaumont]].
