The [[Vinh International Airport]] is served daily by four carriers: [[Vietnam Airlines]], [[VietJet Air]], [[Bamboo Airways]] and [[Jetstar Pacific]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vinpearl.com/en/vinh-international-airport-what-you-should-know|title=Vinh International Airport: What you should know}}</ref> On September 5, 2008, it was upgraded from Grade-II city to Grade-I city, the fifth city to hold the status, after [[Hai Phong|Haiphong]], [[Da Nang|Đà Nẵng]] and [[Huế]]. Vinh is the most populous city in the North [[Central Vietnam|Central Coastal region]], with over 502,140 residents as of 2018. The city is bordered by [[Nghi Lộc district]] to the North and East, [[Hưng Nguyên district]] to the West, and [[Nghi Xuân district]] of [[Hà Tĩnh Province]] to the South across the Lam River. Vinh is about {{convert|300|km}} South of [[Hanoi]] and {{convert|1,400|km}} North of [[Ho Chi Minh City]]. The total area of Vinh city is {{convert|104.97|km2}}, divided administratively into 16 [[Ward (Vietnam)|wards]] and 9 [[Commune (Vietnam)|communes]].

==History==
[[File:Bản vẽ thành Vinh, Nghệ An.jpg|thumb|Drawing of Vinh citadel in the Nguyễn dynasty]]
Vinh was originally known as Ke Van. Later, this successively became Ke Vinh, Vinh Giang, Vinh Doanh, and then Vinh Thi. Eventually, in 1789, the official name became simply Vinh, probably under European influence. The name has remained the same ever since. At various times, Vinh has been of considerable military and political significance. The Vietnamese nation began in the north, and only gradually expanded to cover its current territories – as such, Vinh was sometimes seen as a "gateway to the south".

The [[Tây Sơn dynasty]] (1788–1802) is believed to have considered Vinh as a possible capital of Vietnam, but the short duration of the dynasty meant that any plans did not come to fruition. Tây Sơn interest in the city did, however, result in considerable construction and development there. Under [[French Indochina|French rule of Vietnam]], Vinh was further developed as an industrial center, and became well known for its factories.

Historically, Vinh and its surrounding areas have often been important centers of rebellion and revolutionary activity. In the 19th century and the early 20th century, the city was the center of several prominent uprisings against the French. In addition, a number of notable revolutionary figures were born in or near the city of Vinh, including [[Nguyễn Du]], [[Phan Bội Châu]], [[Trần Trọng Kim]], [[Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai]], and [[Ho Chi Minh|Hồ Chí Minh]].

The city of Vinh was once the site of a number of significant historic sites, particularly an ancient citadel. Over the years, however, Vinh has been extensively damaged in a number of wars. In the [[First Indochina War|first Indochina war]] during 1950s, fighting between the French colonial powers and the [[Viet Minh|Việt Minh]] resistance forces destroyed much of the city, and further damage was done by United States bombing in the [[Vietnam War]]. As such, little of the original city remains today. The reconstruction of Vinh borrowed heavily on [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[East Germany|East German]] ideas about town planning, and was conducted with considerable East German assistance – the city is noted for its wide streets and its rows of concrete apartment blocks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://jacobinmag.com/2021/05/international-solidarity-postwar-vietnam-vinh-socialist-housing|title=International Solidarity Rebuilt Postwar Vietnam|website=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]|last1=Hatherley|first1=Owen|author-link=Owen Hatherley|date=17 May 2021|access-date=18 May 2021}}</ref>

==Climate==
