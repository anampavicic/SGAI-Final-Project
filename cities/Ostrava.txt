'''Ostrava''' ({{IPA|cs|ˈostrava|lang|Cs-Ostrava.ogg}}; {{langx|pl|Ostrawa}}, {{langx|de|Ostrau}}) is a city in the north-east of the [[Czech Republic]] and the capital of the [[Moravian-Silesian Region]]. It has about 280,000 inhabitants. It lies {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} from the border with [[Poland]], at the confluences of four rivers: [[Oder]], [[Opava (river)|Opava]], [[Ostravice (river)|Ostravice]] and [[Lučina (river)|Lučina]]. Ostrava is the third largest city in the Czech Republic in terms of both population and area, the second largest city in the region of [[Moravia]], and the largest city in the historical land of [[Czech Silesia]]. It straddles the border of the two historic provinces of Moravia and Silesia. The wider [[conurbation]] – which also includes the towns of [[Bohumín]], [[Havířov]], [[Karviná]], [[Orlová]], [[Petřvald (Karviná District)|Petřvald]] and [[Rychvald]] – is home to about 500,000 people,<ref name=pop/> making it the largest urban area in the Czech Republic apart from the capital [[Prague]].

Ostrava grew in importance due to its position at the heart of a major [[coalfield]], becoming an important industrial engine of the Austrian empire. During the 20th century it was known as the "steel heart" of Czechoslovakia thanks to its status as a [[Coal mining|coal-mining]] and [[Metallurgy|metallurgical]] centre, but since the [[Velvet Revolution]] (the fall of communism in 1989) it has undergone radical and far-reaching changes to its economic base. Industries have been thoroughly restructured, and the last [[coal]] was mined in the city in 1994. However, remnants of the city's industrial past are visible in the [[Lower Vítkovice]] area, a former coal-mining, [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] production and [[ironworks]] complex in the city centre which retains its historic industrial architecture. Lower Vítkovice has applied for inclusion in the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]].

Ostrava is home to various cultural facilities including theatres and galleries. Various cultural and sporting events take place in Ostrava throughout the year, including the [[Colours of Ostrava]] music festival, the [[Janáček Music Festival|Janáček May]] classical music festival, the Summer Shakespeare Festival and [[NATO Days in Ostrava|NATO Days]]. Ostrava is home to two public universities: the [[Technical University of Ostrava]] and the [[University of Ostrava]]. In 2014 Ostrava was a European City of Sport. The city co-hosted (with Prague) the [[Ice Hockey World Championships]] in [[2004 IIHF World Championship|2004]], [[2015 IIHF World Championship|2015]], and [[2024 IIHF World Championship|2024]].

==Administrative division==
[[File:Ostrava obvody.svg|thumb|Self-governing districts of Ostrava]]
[[File:Katastrální mapa Ostravy.png|thumb|Administrative parts of Ostrava]]
On 14 September 1990, Ostrava's City Authority approved the division of the city into 22 boroughs, effective 24 November that year. On 1 January 1994, Plesná separated from Poruba and became a separate borough.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vznik samostatného městského obvodu Plesná v roce 1994|url=https://encyklopedie.ostrava.cz/home-mmo/?acc=profil_udalosti&load=1350|publisher=City of Ostrava|language=cs|access-date=2023-11-14}}</ref> Since then, the city has been divided into 23 boroughs,<ref>{{cite web |title=Městské obvody|url=https://www.ostrava.cz/cs/o-meste/mestske-obvody|publisher=City of Ostrava|language=cs|access-date=2023-11-14}}</ref> further divided into 37 administrative parts:<ref>{{cite web |title=Části obcí|url=http://www.uir.cz/casti-obce|work=Územně identifikační registr ČR|language=cs|access-date=2023-11-14}}</ref>

==Symbols and logo==
===Coat of arms===
The city's coat of arms features a blue shield with a rearing silver horse standing on a green lawn. The horse wears a golden saddle and a red coverlet. At the top right of the shield there is a golden rose with green leaves and a red core. The horse in the coat-of-arms wears no bridle. The oldest known depiction of this coat-of-arms is on a seal dating from 1426. The first coloured version dates from 1728. The horse is often interpreted as a symbol of Ostrava's position on a major trade route, or as a figure taken from the coat-of-arms of Ostrava's first [[vogt]] (reeve), while the golden rose probably comes from the family coat-of-arms of the bishop of Olomouc [[Stanislav I Thurzo]]. This explanation is supported by most modern literature.<ref name="CoA">{{cite web |title=Znak města Ostravy|url=https://www.ostrava.cz/cs/o-meste/znak-mesta-ostravy|publisher=City of Ostrava|language=cs|access-date=2020-10-14}}</ref>

Another theory suggests that the Bishop granted Ostrava the right to use the horse in its coat-of-arms out of gratitude for the assistance that the town provided to the people of the Bishop's estate in [[Hukvaldy]] when the estate was being looted and pillaged. Apparently the help came so quickly that the pillagers did not have time to attach bridles to their horses before making their escape. There is also a legend which tells of a siege of Ostrava during which the besieged townspeople released unbridled horses to run in circles around the town. This is said to have confused the attacking armies so much that they fled.<ref name=CoA/>

===Marketing logo===
In 2008, Ostrava's new marketing logo was unveiled. Designed by Studio Najbrt, the logo "OSTRAVA!!!" is used in public presentations of the city both in the Czech Republic and abroad. The three exclamation marks are meant to symbolise the dynamism, energy and self-confidence of Ostrava and its people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ostrava.cz/en/o-meste/logo-mesta-ostravy/logo-mesta-ostravy-en/|title=Logo of the City of Ostrava|website=Ostrava.cz|access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref> The light blue colour of the city's name is based on the heraldic tradition, while the exclamation marks are a contrasting darker blue.

==History==
[[File:Ostrava-stWenceslas.jpg|thumb|180px|The Church of St. Wenceslaus, one of the oldest and most important monuments of Ostrava]]
The first written mention of [[Slezská Ostrava]] (Silesian Ostrava) dates from 1229, when it was described as a settlement. The first mention of Moravian Ostrava (Moravská Ostrava) in 1267 describes it as a township. Ostrava grew on the banks of the Ostrá River (now the [[Ostravice (river)|Ostravice]]) from which it took its name. The river still divides the city into two main parts: Moravian Ostrava (Moravská Ostrava) and Silesian Ostrava (Slezská Ostrava). The settlement occupied a strategic position on the border between the two historic provinces of [[Moravia]] and [[Silesia]] and on the ancient [[trade route]] from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Adriatic Sea]] known as the [[Amber Road]]. Its location helped the town to grow and flourish.

However, Ostrava began to decline in importance after the [[Thirty Years' War]], and it was occupied by [[Denmark–Norway|Danish]] forces in 1626,<ref>{{cite web |title=Historické kalendárium pro týden od 23. dubna do 29. dubna|url=https://www.ostrava.cz/cs/o-meste/prezentace/historicke-kalendarium-1/archiv-historickeho-kalendaria/article.2018-05-09.2330073294|website=ostrava.cz|publisher=City of Ostrava|language=cs|access-date=21 March 2021}}</ref> and by [[Swedish Empire|Swedish]] forces from 1642 to 1650.<ref>{{cite web |title=Historické kalendárium pro týden od 15. května do 21. května|url=https://www.ostrava.cz/cs/o-meste/prezentace/historicke-kalendarium-1/archiv-historickeho-kalendaria/article.2017-05-22.4212250760|website=ostrava.cz|publisher=City of Ostrava|language=cs|access-date=21 March 2021}}</ref>

[[File:Ostrava-column.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Marian Column (1702) at Masaryk Square]]
A turning point in Ostrava's history came in 1763 with the discovery of extensive deposits of high-quality [[bituminous coal]] on the Silesian bank of the Ostravice River. In 1828, the owner of the local estates, Rudolf Jan, the [[archbishop of Olomouc]], established an [[ironworks]], which was named after him as the Rudolfshütte. Later, the ironworks passed into the ownership of the [[Rothschild family]] and became known as the [[Vítkovice Mining and Iron Corporation|Vítkovice Ironworks]]. The company became the driving force behind Ostrava's industrial boom. By the second half of the 20th century, the city was nicknamed the country's "steel heart".

In 1931 the Jewish community in Ostrava numbered 6,865 (5.4% of the population).<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Ostrava Moravska |url=https://dbs.anumuseum.org.il/skn/en/c6/e191678/Place/Ostrava_ |website=ANU [We] Museum of the Jewish People |access-date=3 June 2021 |ref=191678}}</ref> About 8,000 Jews from the Ostrava district were murdered in the [[The Holocaust in Bohemia and Moravia|Holocaust]] during the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German occupation]] in [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Moravska Ostrava |url=http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/text/x23/xm2352.html |website=Museum of Tolerance Online Multimedia Learning Center |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321041517/http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/text/x23/xm2352.html |access-date=6 June 2021|archive-date=21 March 2005}}</ref> The [[Nisko Plan]] included the first deportation train transports of 1,301 Jews from Ostrava on 17 and 26 October 1939.<ref>{{cite web |work=Holocaust Survivors and Victims Database |title=Two lists of Jews deported from Ostrava, Czechoslovakia and vicinity in 1939 / [compiled by Otto Winecki] |url=https://www.ushmm.org/online/hsv/source_view.php?SourceId=33095 |publisher=The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |access-date=6 June 2021 |ref=ID: 33095}}</ref> In 1994, a Holocaust memorial to the Jewish victims of Ostrava was built in Milada Horáková Park.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Klenovsky |first1=Jaroslav |title=Jewish monuments of Moravia and Silesia |date=2002 |publisher=ERA Group |location=Brno |isbn=80-86517-08-X |page=148}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Vecerova |first1=Petra |title=Jewish monuments in Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia |date=2009 |publisher=Olympia |location=Prague |isbn=978-80-7376-142-4 |pages=276–277}}</ref>
During World War II the city was [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|occupied by Germany]]. The occupiers operated a ''[[Gestapo]]'' prison in the city,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&tab=7&id=100000248|title=Gestapogefängnis Mährisch Ostrau|website=Bundesarchiv.de|access-date=13 November 2021|language=de}}</ref> and several [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]] camps, including three labour "education" camps, located in Moravská Ostrava,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&tab=7&id=2612|title=Arbeitserziehungslager Mährisch Ostrau|website=Bundesarchiv.de|access-date=13 November 2021|language=de}}</ref> [[Vítkovice (Ostrava)|Vítkovice]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&tab=7&id=2614|title=Arbeitserziehungslager Mährisch Ostrau-Witkowitz|website=Bundesarchiv.de|access-date=13 November 2021|language=de}}</ref> and [[Kunčice (Ostrava)|Kunčice]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&tab=7&id=1584|title=Arbeitserziehungslager Ostrava-Kuncice|website=Bundesarchiv.de|access-date=13 November 2021|language=de}}</ref> and the E21 subcamp of the [[Stalag VIII-B|Stalag VIII-B/344]] [[German prisoner-of-war camps in World War II|prisoner-of-war camp]] in the present-day district of Petřkovice.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lamsdorf.com/working-parties.html|title=Working Parties|website=Lamsdorf.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201029103834/https://www.lamsdorf.com/working-parties.html|access-date=13 November 2021|archive-date=29 October 2020}}</ref>

After the war, the city's German-speaking population [[expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|were expelled]] in accordance with the [[Potsdam Agreement]]. 231 German-speaking citizens were killed in a massacre at an internment camp, known as the [[List of massacres in the Czech Republic#Massacres after World War II up until communist takeover on February 25, 1948|Hanke Lager Massacres]].<ref>''Ermittlungen in Ostrau eingestellt''. Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (dpa), 26. November 2010.</ref> The liberation of Ostrava by the [[Red Army]] led to the city entering its greatest period of expansion. Initially, the new housing projects were on a relatively-small scale focusing on the [[Poruba (Ostrava)|Poruba]] district and featuring architecture in the [[Socialist realism]] style. Later, however, the authorities built larger-scale developments of prefabricated apartment blocks in Poruba and created a series of satellite estates to the south of the city (Ostrava-Jih). The city centre was gradually depopulated, and its people were moved out to the suburbs, as part of a long-term plan to destroy the city centre entirely and to turn the land over to coal-mining.
[[File:Ostrava-bridge-radnice.jpg|thumb|Miloš Sýkora Bridge over the Ostravice River and Silesian Ostrava Town Hall]]

The 1990s brought a rapid decline in the city's traditional industrial sectors: iron, steel, chemicals and coal-mining. The last coal was mined on 30 June 1994, which was accompanied by major investments to rectify ecological damage done by decades of heavy industry. The projects ultimately brought major improvements in the city's environment and quality of life. Ostrava became an important tourist centre that offered easy access to the nearby [[Hrubý Jeseník]] and [[Moravian-Silesian Beskids]] mountains.

As well as hundreds of hectares of recultivated former mining land, the city also has numerous natural landscape features of interest, many of which are protected nature reserves. They include the Polanský Forest and the Polanská Meadows, both of which form part of the Poodří ([[Oder]] Basin) nature reserve.

A rare geological feature found in the city is the granite [[glacial erratic|erratic boulders]]. Originally from Scandinavia, they were left behind after the [[Last Glacial Period|last ice age]], when the [[ice sheets]] retreated. Another feature is the Ema [[spoil tip|slag heap]], an artificial hill made of mining waste (slag) that offers panoramic views. The waste is still burning deep beneath the surface, which gives the slag-heap its own [[microclimate]].

On 10 December 2019, a [[Ostrava hospital attack|shooting at a hospital in Ostrava]] left eight people dead, including the perpetrator.

==Geography==
Ostrava is located about {{convert|270|km}} east of [[Prague]]. It lies mostly in the [[Ostrava Basin]] lowland, only the southwestern part of the municipal territory extends into the [[Moravian Gate]]. Ostrava is mostly low-lying, with a highest point of {{convert|280|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. The city is situated at the meeting point of four rivers: [[Oder]], [[Opava (river)|Opava]], [[Ostravice (river)|Ostravice]] and [[Lučina (river)|Lučina]]. It differs from most neighbouring regions by the high concentration of industry, dense population and the geographical conditions of the Ostrava Basin. The [[Poodří Protected Landscape Area]] extends to the city's territory in the southwest.

Ostrava is 20.5&nbsp;km across from north to south (Antošovice–Nová Bělá), and 20.1&nbsp;km across from east to west (Bartovice–Krásné Pole).

===Climate===
Ostrava has an [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb'') or [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] (''Dfb'') climate, according with the isotherm 0&nbsp;°C/-3&nbsp;°C, the second most common in Europe (the average temperature in month most cold is {{cvt|-1|°C}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=28711&cityname=Ostrava,+Moravskoslezsky,+Czech+Republic&units=metric|title=Ostrava, Czech Republic Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=28711&cityname=Ostrava,+Moravskoslezsky,+Czech+Republic&units=metric|title=Ostrava, Czech Republic Travel Weather Averages|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref> The climate features hot, humid summers and relatively mild winters, with an average annual temperature of {{cvt|10.2|°C}} (January: {{cvt|-1.2|°C}} July: {{cvt|23.5|°C}}) and average annual precipitation of 580&nbsp;mm.

==Transport==
[[File:LKMTnight.jpg|thumb|[[Leoš Janáček Airport Ostrava]]]]
Ostrava is the transport and logistics hub of the north-eastern part of the Czech Republic, located close to the borders with Slovakia and Poland, and with an airport and highway connection nearby. 

===Air===
{{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} south of the city centre is an international airport, [[Leoš Janáček Airport Ostrava]], which links the city with several European destinations (IATA code: OSR; ICAO code: LKMT). It is the first airport in the Czech Republic to have its own rail link, which opened in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |title=Czech Republic: New rail link to Ostrava international airport |url=https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/czech-republic-new-rail-link-to-ostrava-international-airport/ |website=Railway Pro |access-date=12 March 2023 |date=15 April 2015}}</ref>

===Roads===
The road infrastructure of the region is centred on the [[D1 motorway (Czech Republic)|D1 motorway]], which runs from Prague via Brno and Ostrava into Poland. Ostrava is {{convert|360|km|abbr=on}} from Prague by motorway, {{convert|170|km|abbr=on}} from Brno, {{convert|90|km|abbr=on}} from the Polish city of [[Katowice]], and {{convert|310|km|abbr=on}} from [[Vienna]]. Other major roads which pass through Ostrava are the Class I roads 11, 56, 58 and 59.

===Public transport===
[[File:Ostrava, Nová Ves, vodárna, Varia LF2.jpg|thumb|Ostrava trams in their traditional blue and white livery at the "Nová Ves vodárna" stop]]
{{Further|Trams in Ostrava}}
The city has a dense public transport network consisting of [[trams]], [[buses]] and [[trolleybuses]]. The first trams, introduced in 1894, were powered by steam engines. The network was rapidly expanded, and in 1901 it was electrified. New tram lines were built mainly to the south and east of the city centre, where they would not have to cross the [[narrow-gauge railway]]s linking Ostrava with [[Karviná]] and [[Bohumín]].

[[Trolleybuses]] were introduced in 1952, as in other Czech towns and cities after World War II. Initially there was one trolleybus route which encircled the city centre. The network was gradually expanded in the 1950s and 60s, replacing the [[narrow-gauge railways]]. 
A route to the Fifejdy housing estate was built in the late 1970s. The last expansion of the trolleybus network came in the mid-2010s, when a route was built out to the new terminal in Hranečník. 17 [[tram]] lines currently operate in Ostrava. There are 52 bus lines and 14 [[trolleybus]] lines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dpo.cz/jizdni-rady/jr-trol.html |title=Ostrava Public Transportation Website |date=28 November 2016 |publisher=DPO |access-date=28 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115001639/https://www.dpo.cz/jizdni-rady/jr-trol.html |archive-date=15 January 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Rail===
[[File:Ostrava, Svinov, panorama nádraží.jpg|thumb|Railway station Ostrava-Svinov]]
Ostrava is also a major railway hub, sited on Railway Corridors II and III and serving as an important centre for cargo and passenger transport between the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. The city's largest railway stations are [[Ostrava main railway station|the main station]] (''Ostrava hl.n.'') and Ostrava-Svinov. These stations are important railway junctions. The main line linking Ostrava with [[Olomouc]], [[Pardubice]] and [[Prague]] is served by three railway companies: [[České dráhy]], [[RegioJet]] and [[LEO Express]].

==Environment==
Ostrava's high concentration of heavy industry created various environmental problems in the city, particularly in relation to air quality. Measurements performed by the [[Czech Hydrometeorological Institute]] show that levels of atmospheric benzopyrene and dust particles are among the highest in the country.

[[File:Ostravice.jpg|thumb|The Ostravice River]]
Although Ostrava still has to contend with environmental issues, the situation has improved over time. In 2015 ArcelorMittal, then one of the biggest polluters in the region, implemented 13 major ecological investment projects worth CZK 3 billion.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} One new installation filters out 61 tonnes of dust per year. The City of Ostrava is also involved in a range of projects focusing on environmental improvements, including a web portal, ''www.zdravaova.cz'', which enables citizens to monitor current air quality indicators, and a project funding short "health breaks" for children from high-risk areas.

One of the most pressing environmental problems currently facing the city concerns the oil lagoons at the site of the former Ostramo chemical plant. In 1996 the Czech government took over the site and drew up plans for a cleanup. The state-owned company Diamo was created to implement these plans. The situation has been the subject of government-level discussions,{{when|date=May 2018}} and Finance Minister [[Andrej Babiš]] visited Ostrava in March 2015.

Air quality in Ostrava is currently very poor, with high concentrations of [[benzopyrene]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.chmi.cz/files/portal/docs/uoco/isko/grafroc/16groc/gr16cz/png/oIV2-1.png |title=Obr.IV.2.1 Pole roční průměrné koncentrace benzo[a]pyrenu, 2016 |website=portal.chmi.cz |access-date=26 July 2022}}</ref> The pollution is so serious that it has been described in folklore; local people refer to "Černá Ostrava" (Black Ostrava) and have several songs about it.

==Culture==
[[File:Divadlo Antonína Dvořáka.jpg|thumb|Inside the Antonín Dvořák Theatre]]

===Performing arts===
Ostrava has four permanent theatres: the [[National Moravian-Silesian Theatre]] (with two permanent venues, the [[Antonín Dvořák Theatre]] and the Jiří Myron Theatre), the Petr Bezruč Theatre, the [[Aréna Chamber Theatre]] and the Ostrava Puppet Theatre – which hosts the international Spectaculo Interesse festival every odd-numbered year and the Theatre Without Barriers festival every even-numbered year.
[[File:Colours of Ostrava.jpg|thumb|Colours of Ostrava]]
Ostrava is home to the [[Janáček Philharmonic Orchestra]], and hosts a number of international annual or biennial classical music festivals, including [[Janáček Music Festival|Janáček May]], the St Wenceslaus Music Festival and the [[Ostrava Days]] new music festival. Since 2002 Ostrava has been the venue for the annual multi-genre music festival [[Colours of Ostrava]], which features an international line-up of artists and attracts crowds of tens of thousands.

Other cultural events in Ostrava include the film and theatre festivals [[One World Film Festival|One World]], Ostrava Camera Eye ({{langx|cs|Ostrava Kamera Oko}}), the International Outdoor Films Festival, and the Summer Shakespeare Festival (held on an outdoor stage at the [[Silesian Ostrava Castle]]). Folklore festivals include the Harmony ({{langx|cs|Souznění}}) international festival of Advent and Christmas traditions and crafts, Folklore Without Borders, and the Irish Cultural Festival.

===Museums and galleries===
[[File:Divadlo loutek.jpg|thumb|upright|Ostrava Puppet Theatre]]
Ostrava has several museums and galleries:

* The '''Ostrava City Museum''', a museum located in the 16th-century Old City Hall building on the main central square, housing permanent exhibitions on the city's history, landscape and people.
* The '''Ostrava Science and Technology Centre''', an interactive museum about the world of technology aimed at all ages, including simulators for driving a train, flying a plane, or working as a steelworker or an astronaut. The Science and Technology Centre comprises two parts: the Small World of Technology, and the Large World of Technology (14,000 m2), which is divided into four different "worlds" within one building.
* The '''Toy Museum''', a toy museum including examples from over 60 countries, including some toys from the mid-19th century.
* The '''Railway Museum''', featuring model trains, and a collection of original documents from the period of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].
* The '''Brewery Museum''', focused on the history and technology of brewing.
* The '''Firefighting Museum''', housed in an [[Art Nouveau]] building in the [[Přívoz]] district previously used as a fire station. The exhibition includes a video showing firefighting techniques.
* '''Keltička's Forge Museum''', a permanent exhibition of blacksmithing and coal-mining. The building used to be the home of a blacksmith named Keltička (commemorated in a small memorial outside the building). According to the local legend it was Keltička who first discovered Ostrava's coal deposits. The museum maps the early beginnings of Ostrava's coal mining industry, including a collection of miners' helmets and lamps from the 17th century and a range of other exhibits.
* The '''Professor F. Pošepný Geology Pavilion''', which includes over 15,000 exhibits of minerals, rocks and fossils.
* The '''House of Art''' ({{langx|cs|Dům umění}}), a gallery of fine art housed in a building from the early 20th century.
* The '''PLATO (Ostrava City Gallery)''', an exhibition space with no permanent collections, which provides a space for exhibitions of contemporary Czech and international art.
* The '''[[Zither]] Museum''', a collection featuring examples of the musical instrument.
* The '''Mining Museum''' at Landek Park, featuring a guided tour of the former Anselm coal mine with a guide who was a miner there, including a descent into a simulated mine tunnel.
* The '''Mill Museum''', a museum of mills and milling in the Ostrava region.
* The '''Michal Colliery museum''', a museum in a former coal mine presenting the city's history of mining. The guided tour leads along the same route taken by the miners when they started their shift, but it is not possible for visitors to the museum to go underground. The museum is a National Cultural Monument.
* '''Ostrava Planetárium'''

==Sights==
* [[File:Ostrava-radnice.jpg|thumb|200px|New City Hall]] Ostrava's [[New Town Hall, Ostrava|New City Hall]] has the tallest tower of any city hall in the Czech Republic, with a viewing platform 73 metres above ground providing a panoramic view of the city.
* Komenského Gardens is a park in the city centre named after the Renaissance-era Czech writer and educator [[John Amos Comenius]], and the site of a statue honouring the Soviet soldiers who liberated Ostrava in 1945.
* The Miniuni World of Miniatures, located at the Černá Louka exhibition grounds, features miniature versions of famous buildings from around the world, including the Pyramids, Eiffel Tower, and Big Ben.
* The fairytale clock at Ostrava's Puppet Theatre features figurines which perform a show at two-hour intervals from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. The performance lasts two minutes. It depicts a battle between Kasper the clown and the Grim Reaper, and it also features four other characters – an angel, a king, a queen, and a devil. 
* The [[Silesian Ostrava Castle]], close to Masaryk Square, once stood on higher ground, but over time it has sunk by 16 metres due to mine tunnels collapsing underneath it. The castle is located at the confluence of the [[Lučina (river)|Lučina]] and [[Ostravice (river)|Ostravice]] rivers. The castle is the venue for the summer Shakespeare festival, among other events.
* [[Stodolní street (Ostrava)|Stodolní Street]] is the city's entertainment district, with more than 60 bars, clubs, restaurants and cafés.
* [[File:Ostrava-mainsquare.jpg|thumb|200px|Masaryk Square]] Masaryk Square is located in Ostrava's historical centre and has a [[plague column]] with a figure of the Virgin Mary (1702) and a [[Baroque]] statue of [[Saint Florian]], the patron saint of firefighters. There is a series of commemorative paving stones that starts outside the Laso shopping mall, as well as the Schönhof building, known as "the house with seven doors", and the Reisz building designed by the Viennese architect [[Wunibald Deininger]].
* The Karolina Triple Hall ({{langx|cs|Trojhalí}}) is an urban space located next to the Forum Nová Karolina shopping mall. These large historic buildings – formerly part of the Karolina coking plant – have been transformed by the architect [[Josef Pleskot]] into a new venue for sports, entertainment and culture.
* [[Ostrava Zoo]] is the second largest zoo in the Czech Republic and home to more than 400 different species of animals. In 2014 a new safari park was built, and in 2015 the zoo opened a new pavilion illustrating the process of evolution.
* Lower Vítkovice preserves a historic [[blast furnace]] and has a glass elevator to the newly built viewing platform at the top, with panoramic views of Ostrava and the surrounding countryside. There are guided tours describing Vítkovice's history. The blast furnace, the former power station, compressor hall and coal mine are open to the public. The former [[gas holder]] has been repurposed into a multi-functional hall called the Gong.
* Ema slag-heap, on the right bank of the Ostravice, is an artificial hill created by piling up [[slag]], or waste material from coal mines. Its top is {{convert|315|m}} above sea level. It has a subtropical micro-climate because the waste material is still burning deep beneath the surface. White smoke comes out of cracks in the ground. Snow never settles here, and flowers grow all year round. A yellow-marked hiking path leads to the top, from where there are panoramic views of the city.

===Architecture===
[[File:Ostrava-rynek.jpg|thumb|200px|Jirásek Square, former chicken market ({{lang|cs|kuří rynek}}), in Moravská Ostrava]]
There are four [[Cultural monument (Czech Republic)#Monument zones|urban monument zones]] in Ostrava – Moravská Ostrava (the historic centre), Ostrava-Poruba, Ostrava-Přívoz, and Ostrava-Vítkovice. Much of Ostrava's architectural heritage is in the city centre. The most notable structures are theatres, banks, department stores and other public buildings dating from the turn of the 20th century, at the time of Ostrava's greatest boom. The central Masaryk Square, named after the first President of Czechoslovakia [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]], features the historic old city hall building and a Marian plague column from 1702. Nearby [[Bedřich Smetana|Smetanovo]] Square features the [[Antonín Dvořák Theatre]] and the [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalist]] Knihcentrum bookstore. To the west are a series of grand, imposing bank buildings and the Elektra Palace on Nádražní Street, while to the north is the [[New Town Hall, Ostrava|New City Hall]] with its landmark viewing tower, overlooking the large open space of Prokeš Square.

The city centre also has two notable religious buildings – the 13th-century Church of [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|St. Wenceslaus]] and the [[Cathedral of the Divine Saviour]], the second largest church in [[Moravia]] and [[Czech Silesia]]. Ostrava's central district contains works by architects including Karel Kotas, [[Josef Gočár]], Ernst Korner and [[Alexander Graf]].

[[Poruba (Ostrava)|Poruba]] is a large district of Ostrava in the western part of the conurbation, noted for its distinctive 1950s [[Socialist Realism|Socialist realist]] architecture. Inspired by the grandiose buildings of [[Soviet]] cities, Poruba also incorporates historical pastiche features drawing on ancient, Renaissance and Classicist models. The main entrance to the part of Poruba built at this time is through a grand triumphal arch.

The [[Vítkovice (Ostrava)|Vítkovice]] district was for several decades the centre of the local iron and steel industry. The influx of workers led the company to build housing for its employees, plus civic amenities, a town hall and a church. The historic parts of the district are built in the company's distinctive style featuring red-brick façades.

Other districts of the city with a distinctive architectural heritage include [[Přívoz]] (with its grand Art Nouveau buildings) and the Jubilee housing development ({{langx|cs|Jubilejní kolonie}}) in Hrabůvka, built as a workers' housing complex in the 1920s.
