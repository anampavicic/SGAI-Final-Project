==History==
It was classified as a department on January 28, 1865. The population was settled on the Ulliman Plains, which is where rubber is harvested. The city was called "Nueva Ciudad de San Salvador" (New City of San Salvador) and made the department's capital on the same date as the department was declared. The department's capital was renamed Santa Tecla on December 22, 2003. The agricultural products that are cultivated are the basic grains, balsam, sugar cane, coffee, grass, hortensia, cocoa, and fruits.

At 12&nbsp;km. to the west of the capital city, in a valley at 923 meters above sea level, is located the town of Santa Tecla whose official name is Nueva San Salvador. Because it is between on the sides of Quezaltepeque or [[Volcano of San Salvador]] and a low and picturesque mountain, in poetic language it is designated as “The city of the hills”. The earthquake of April 16, 1854, destroyed the capital city from its foundations. Facing the moving debris, the President José María San Martín settled the government's new headquarters in the plain of Santa Tecla. The decree was emitted the following August 8, but it was not until Christmas Day of the same year that the neighbours took possession of the place and they swore vicinity.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=January 2016}} It was ascended to the category of departmental head on January 28, 1865.

It has modern and old churches: The parish of Concepción and the neo-Gothic Carmen's Church,  built at the end of the past century by the architect, sculptor, and painter Pascacio Gonzales.
