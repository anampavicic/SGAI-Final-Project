== History ==
[[File:Суми. Sumy. 1897.png|thumb|Central Sumy in 1897]]
[[File:Coin of Ukraine Sumy R.jpg|100px|thumb|Commemorative coin of Sumy's 350-year history]]
Sumy was founded by the Cossack [[Herasym Kondratyev]] from [[Stavyshche]], [[Bila Tserkva Regiment]] on the banks of the [[Psel River]], a tributary of the [[Dnieper]].<ref name=eohou>Bazhan, O.H., Vortman, D.Ya., Masliychuk, V.L. ''[http://resource.history.org.ua/cgi-bin/eiu/history.exe?Z21ID=&I21DBN=EIU&P21DBN=EIU&S21STN=1&S21REF=10&S21FMT=eiu_all&C21COM=S&S21CNR=20&S21P01=0&S21P02=0&S21P03=TRN=&S21COLORTERMS=0&S21STR=Sumy_mst Sumy, regional center (СУМИ, ОБЛАСНИЙ ЦЕНТР)]''. Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine.</ref> Whether it was founded in 1652 or 1655 remains a subject of discussion.<ref name=eohou/> In 1656–58 at the site of the Sumyn early settlement, under the leadership of the Muscovite [[voivode]] K. Arsenyev, a city fort was built, consisting of a fort and a [[Gord (archaeology)|grad]] (town).<ref name=eohou/> 

In the 1670s, Sumy was expanded with the addition of a fortified ''[[posad]]'' (craftsman town), after which it became the biggest fortress in [[Sloboda Ukraine]].<ref name=eohou/> From 1658 onwards, Sumy was the center of the Sumy Cossack Regiment (military unit and local administrative division).<ref name=eohou/> In the 1680s, unfortified suburbs began to develop around the city.<ref name=eohou/>

At the end of the 17th century, Sumy played a role as a collection point for Muscovite troops during the [[Crimean campaigns of 1687 and 1689]].<ref name=eohou/> During the [[Great Northern War]], from December 1708 to January 1709, the city was the ''[[stavka]]'' (headquarters) of the Muscovite Chief of Commander headed by Tsar [[Peter the Great]].<ref name=eohou/> Established under the leadership of Prince A. Shakhovskoy, the Commission on streamlining the Sloboda Cossack regiments was located in 1734–43 in Sumy.<ref name=eohou/> From its establishment and until the liquidation of Cossackdom in [[Sloboda Ukraine]] in 1765, the Cossack officer family of Kondratyevs exercised great influence over the city.<ref name=eohou/>

Following the liquidation of the Cossack community in 1765, the Sumy Cossack Regiment as an administrative division was turned into Sumy Province of the newly created [[Sloboda Ukraine Governorate]] and the city of Sumy became its center.<ref name=eohou/> In 1780 Sumy was turned into a centre of [[Sumy uyezd]].<ref name=eohou/> In 1786-89 the city was reformed by removing its city fort [[vallum]]s.<ref name=eohou/> 

After a period of stagnation (1765–1860s), Sumy began to transform into a big industrial and trade center with Paul's Sugar-Refining Factory (est. 1869 by I.Kharytonenko) and the Sumy Engineering Workshops (est. 1896, producing equipment for sugar refineries).<ref name=eohou/> With the construction of a railroad [[Vorozhba]] – [[Merefa]], the Sumy train station was built in the city in January 1877.<ref name=eohou/> Various families of philanthropist industrialists, the most famous of which were the Kharytonenkos, contributed greatly to the development of Sumy.<ref name=eohou/>

During the [[Revolution of 1905]], Sumy was one of several areas which became famous throughout Russia for having established an independent [[peasant republic]] -the Sumy Republic was established by a peasant union.<ref>Figes, Orlando: ''A People's Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891–1924''. The Bodley Head, London (2014). p. 183</ref>

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]] occupation of Ukraine during [[World War II]] (1941–1944), Sumy sustained heavy damage and was occupied from 10 October 1941 to 2 September 1943. In February 1942, some 1,000 Jews were murdered in Sumy in two large-scale operations. In May-June that year, the Germans and their Hungarian allies killed an additional several dozen Jews, along with thirty Roma. Some 250 Hungarian Jews were also murdered in Sumy during the occupation period. <ref>[https://collections.yadvashem.org/en/untold-stories/community/14622525 Sumy, Yad Vashem]</ref> The Germans operated a Nazi prison<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&tab=7&id=801|title=Gefängnis Sumy|website=Bundesarchiv.de|access-date=26 February 2022|language=de}}</ref> and a [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]] battalion for [[Jews]] in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&tab=7&id=100002303|title=Jüdisches Arbeitsbataillon Sumy|website=Bundesarchiv.de|access-date=26 February 2022|language=de}}</ref> After the war, the destroyed parts of the city were rebuilt.

The majority of residents are [[Christians]] ([[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic Deanery of Sumy|Roman Catholics]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant or Evangelical Christians]]). There is also a Jewish minority.

From the beginning of the twentieth century, Sumy was the center of [[Roman Catholicism in Ukraine|Roman Catholicism in northeastern Ukraine]]. The Blessed Virgin Mary Annunciation Church was established in the city in 1901 and [[consecration|consecrated]] in 1911, but closed by governmental authorities two decades later; the churchhouse was thereafter used for non-religious purposes (e.g., it was used as a gym for Oleksandrivska Gymnasia) until its restoration as a Roman Catholic [[parish]] in May 1994, after the disintegration of the [[Soviet Union]]. It was reconsecrated in the spring of 1998.

According to the census held in 1660, the population of Sumy was 2740 people. In 1732 it was 7700 people, in 1773 — 9380 people, in 1850 — 10,256 people, in 1898 — 26,355 people.<ref>{{cite web |title=ЭСБЕ/Сумы — Викитека |url=https://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%AD%D0%A1%D0%91%D0%95/%D0%A1%D1%83%D0%BC%D1%8B |website=ru.wikisource.org |access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref>

[[File:Земська управа 04.jpg|thumb|Local Museum]]

The [[Nikanor Onatsky Regional Art Museum in Sumy|Sumy Regional Art Museum]] was opened in 1920. It started with nationalized private collections of the town and district. Paintings of [[Taras Shevchenko]], [[Vladimir Borovikovsky]], I. Shyskin, [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]] and [[Tetyana Yablonska]] are on display, including a Dutch landscape by a painter of [[Jan van Goyen]]'s circle. Today the museum contains unique paintings and works of applied art. The building of the early 20th century originally belonged to the [[State Bank of the Russian Empire|State Bank]].

The Museum of Local Lore was opened in 1920. In the years of fascist occupation, the most important items of its collections were lost. Today it contains unique collections covering [[archeology]] and the natural history of the Sumy region. It is located in the building of the 19th century which originally was the seat of the district government. In 1905 it was given to the printing house and publishing house of the first Sumy newspapers. In different years the building was visited by A. Kuprin and V. Korolenko, the famous Russian writers.

The Chekhov Museum, located on Chekhov street is an architectural complex representing Lintvarev's country estate of the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1888 and 1889 a great writer and dramatist [[Anton Chekhov]] was dreaming of settling in Luka forever but his dream did not come true. “Abbacia and the Adriatic Sea are wonderful, but Luka and Psiol are better” – he wrote in his letter from Italy to his friends in Sumy in 1894. This is also a place where [[Anton Chekhov]]'s brother, [[Nikolai Chekhov]], died in 1889.

The [[Museum of Banking history in the Sumy oblast and the History of Ukrainian Money]] was founded in 2006 to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the [[Ukrainian Academy of Banking of the National Bank of Ukraine|Ukrainian Academy of Banking]] based on a unique collection of Ukrainian bonds – the [[paper money]] out of circulation, which were given to the academy by the [[National Bank of Ukraine]]. The exposition of the bonds is arranged in the thematic-chronological order - from the first appearance of money to the present day. In addition to the numerous historical documents, photographs, metal money (coins, souvenir bars), and commemorative medals of the National Bank of Ukraine, there is an exhibition presenting technical appliances used in the [[banking industry]] in the late 20th century.
