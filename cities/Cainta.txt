'''Cainta''', officially the '''Municipality of Cainta''' ({{lang-fil|Bayan ng Cainta}}, {{IPA|tl|kɐʔɪnˈtaʔ|IPA}}), is a 1st class [[Greater Manila Area|urban]] [[municipality]] in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 376,933 people.{{PH census|current}}

It is one of the oldest municipalities in Luzon (founded on August 15, 1571) and has a land area of {{convert|4299|ha}}.{{PSGC detail|area}}

Cainta serves as the secondary gateway to the rest of Rizal province from [[Metro Manila]]. With the continuous expansion of Metro Manila, Cainta is now part of Manila's [[conurbation]], which reaches [[Cardona, Rizal|Cardona]] in its easternmost part and is therefore one of the most urbanized towns.

As the country's [[List of cities and municipalities in the Philippines|3rd most populous municipality]] after [[Taytay, Rizal]] and [[Rodriguez, Rizal]], efforts are underway to convert it into a city. Its total assets amounting to {{Philippine peso|3,988,392,142.17|link=yes}} (as per 2017 [[Commission on Audit of the Philippines|Commission on Audit]] summary) makes it the richest municipality in the country in terms of income. However, Cainta faces different challenges especially with its boundary disputes with [[Pasig]] (Greenpark Village, Karangalan Village, St. Joseph Subdivision, Villarica Subdivision, Riverside and Midtown Village), Taytay, (Greenland and eastern part of Cainta) and [[Antipolo]] (Valley Golf and Country Club and Valley View), thus hindering cityhood efforts.

==Etymology==
One legend has it that there was an old woman called "Jacinta" who was well known not only in her own native town but also in the neighboring towns. In her youth, she was very popular because of her great beauty, kindness, and wealth. Although she was a member of a very rich clan, she showed generosity of heart to the poor. Hence, she became very much loved and respected.
Jacinta grew to be an old maid because after her sweetheart got sick and died, she never fell in love with anyone else. When her parents died and she was left alone in the house, she continued her charity work. She gave alms to the long line of beggars who came to her and housed and took care of the orphans and children in the streets.

In her old age, she was still very popular and was fondly called "''Ka Inta''" ("''Ka''" referring to a term of respect for the elderly, as well as a term for the feeling of comradery or "kapwa" feeling for someone).

One [[Christmas Day]], however, when the old and the young called on her to give their greetings, she was not by the window to welcome them. People wondered at her absence and shouted her name to call her attention but no one came to answer. Concerned, they went up the house and discovered the dead body of "Ka Inta" lying on the floor. Beside her were the piles of Christmas gifts she was preparing to give to her well-wishers that day. People far and wide grieved over her death. In memory of her goodness and her generosity, her native town was named after her and was called "Cainta".<ref name="Dianne">{{Cite book |title=Tales from the 7,000 isles : Filipino folk stories |last=De Las Casas, Dianne. |date=2011 |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |isbn=9781598846997 |location=Santa Barbara, Calif. |oclc=763156190}}</ref>

However, Cainta was already named Cainta when the Spanish first arrived in the 1520s,<ref name="B&R3Anonymous1572">{{Cite book|title=Relation of the Conquest of the Island of Luzon|publisher=Arthur H. Clark Company|year=1903|editor-last=Blair|editor-first=Emma Helen|editor-link=Emma Helen Blair|volume=3|location=Ohio, Cleveland|pages=145|editor-last2=Robertson|editor-first2=James Alexander|editor-link2=James Alexander Robertson}}</ref> so the Spanish name "Jacinta" is unlikely to be the origin of Cainta's name.

==History==
===The Battle of Cainta===
{{see also|Cainta (historical polity)}}
After the death of [[Rajah Matanda]], Adelantado Miguel de Legaspi received word that two ships, San Juan and Espiritu Santo, had just arrived in [[Panay]] Island in the central Philippines from [[Mexico]]. One ship was under the command of Don Diego de Legaspi, his nephew, and the other of Juan Chacon. The two ships were in such disrepair when they arrived in Panay that one of them was not allowed to return to Mexico. Legaspi ordered that it be docked on the river of Manila. The Maestro de Campo was sent to Panay to oversee its transfer to Manila, with Juan de la Torre as captain.

To help spread the faith, several Augustinian friars were commissioned by Spain and were among the ship's passengers. One of them was Father Alonso de Alvarado, who had been in the [[Naval fleet|''armada'']] of Villalobos. Another was Father Agustin de Albuquerque, who became the first parish priest of Taal town, south of Manila. Some of the missionaries were sent to Cebu province in the central Philippines to accompany Father Martin de Rada the Prior. Four stayed to work in Pampanga province and the environs north and south of Manila, which included the then-village of Cainta.

Meanwhile, Legaspi was determined to subjugate the people of Cainta and Taytay, a neighboring town. He sent his nephew Juan de Salcedo with a galleon (a small ship propelled by oars and sails) and 16 small boats accompanied by a hundred Spanish soldiers and many Visayas natives allied with them. Salcedo sailed on August 15, 1571, arriving in Cainta on the 20th. He sought peace from the villagers but the village chief, Gat-Maitan, responded arrogantly, told him the people of Cainta, unlike those of Manila, were not cowards, and would defend their village to the death. Confident in the defenses offered by their fort and the security of the site, they were joined by people from Taytay.

These two villages are on a plain on the shores of a river that flows from La Laguna and before arriving there divides in two large arms, both with abundant water. On its banks are found the two villages, half a league from each other, with the river passing through both before finally becoming one in a part of the terrain encircled by thick bamboo groves. These bamboos were tied together with ''liana'', turning them into a thick wall where the people had constructed two ramparts with their moats full of water. By the river, they had built strong stone bulwarks with wooden towers and good artillery (culverins or [[lantaka]]s), guarded by a large number of warriors armed with arrows, swords and other projectile-type arms.

Deciding to attack, Salcedo first sent Second Lieutenant Antonio de Carvajal with some escorts to reconnoiter the town and determine the weakest point where they could enter. Carvajal, wounded by an arrow in his arm, returned with the information that the weakest spot, the least fortified and with the easiest access was the other part of an arroyo on the side of La Laguna where many boats could be seen entering the river.

Salcedo ordered installed in the prow of the galley a stone-throwing mortar. He and his men then spent the night on shore, while 20 soldiers and numerous allies from Manila remained with Carvajal on the galley with orders that when they heard firing, they should proceed with the attack on the stone bulwarks and the houses in the town, while Salcedo and his men tried to enter through the wall by the arroyo. When they heard the sound of the bugle, the signal that they had taken the town, they were to stop firing.

After giving these instructions, Salcedo began his march and turned toward the river where the attack was to take place. He arrived in the arroyo and found it defended by a group of Cainta warriors who started to fire arrows and hurl lances.

Taken by surprise, the soldiers without waiting for Salcedo's order attacked the rampart and were overwhelmed by a rain of arrows. Finding such tenacious resistance, they began to retreat and flee in disarray.

Salcedo berated his men harshly for having attacked without his orders. Observing that in the other part of the arroyo the rampart was lower, he ordered a skiff brought there and after beaching it, he ordered some of his soldiers to use it as passage to the other side and take a more elevated point from where they could fire at the defenders of the town.

With the defenders retreating, Salcedo and his men were able to approach the wall and breach it. Gat-Maitan with his Cainta men came to close the breach, forcing Saavedra to back off.

In the meantime, the cannons of the galley destroyed the stone bulwarks and the houses in the town in a manner the people had not seen before. The shouts of the 600 Visayans allied with the Spanish made the natives believe that the Spaniards were already inside the ''poblacion'' [town proper]. Because of this, defenders of the breach abandoned it and retreated to the center of the town.

Salcedo observed this from a distance and ordered the breach attacked again. This time, the Spaniards encountered little resistance. Led by Salcedo and with Saavedra carrying the Spanish banner, they succeeded in entering the town. Together with their soldiers, they advanced rapidly and shortly scaled the wall where a bloody battle was fought.

The Cainta men, encouraged by their chief Gat-Maitan, preferred to die rather than surrender. Having taken over the stone walls, the Spaniards climbed the towers and hoisted the Spanish banner. At the blare of the bugle, the cannons stopped firing from the galley.

===Spanish rule===
[[File:Ang Sepoy at ang Magsusuman, Cainta, Rizal.jpg|thumb|Ang Sepoy at ang Magsusuman]]
Founded on November 30, 1571, Cainta was a fiercely independent village that fought valiantly against the Spaniards but was later defeated and became a ''visita'' (annex) of Taytay in 1571 under the [[Jesuits]]. Changes in ecclesiastical administration made Cainta a part of Pasig under the Augustinians but it was deeded back to the Jesuits by the King of Spain in 1696. Cainta became a separate township in 1760.

====Conversion to Catholicism====
The chief religion is Roman Catholicism. When the Spaniards arrived, they celebrated the feast of [[St. Andrew]] the Apostle and a mass was held in a chapel made of nipa palm branches and wood. Many people came to attend and consequently were baptized into the faith.

The Church of Cainta was completed in 1715. It was gutted during World War II. Only the outer walls and the facade remained which was repaired with a coat of Portland cement. In 1727, an image depicting Our Lady of Light was brought to Cainta from Sicily, Italy, and was among the structures destroyed by Japanese and the joint American and Filipino bombs. Except for the outer walls, now greatly renovated, hardly anything remains of the old church. Extensive damage was also caused by recurrent earthquakes and typhoons that plagued the Philippines. The natives helped in its restoration and the new building was completed on February 25, 1968, and blessed by Manila Cardinal Archbishop [[Rufino Jiao Santos]].

Cainta became an independent town in 1760. During the brief British occupation of Luzon (1762–1763), part of its [[British Raj|British India]] troops known as [[Sepoy]]s lived and intermarried with the natives in one of the town's barrios. The Indian left a culinary legacy in the spicy and highly seasoned dishes that are now part of mainstream Cainta cuisine. Cainta became part of [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]] (starting 1763) but separated in 1883 and incorporated with the district of [[Morong (district)|Morong]].

===American colonial era===
====March 16, 1899====
{{More citations needed section|date=October 2024}}
Exequiel Ampil was assigned by Emilio Aguinaldo to liberate Cainta.

Maj. William P. Rogers, CO of the 3rd Battalion, 20th US Infantry Regiment, came upon the Filipinos in Cainta, about 1,000 strong, and forced them to retreat. He burned the town. Two Americans were killed and 14 wounded, while the Filipinos suffered about 100 killed and wounded.

Upon the approach of the Americans, Exequiel Ampil y Dela Cruz,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1358578890850&set=a.1351167705575.2046618.1422856792&type=3|title=General Infos... - James Frank Ampil Olaño - Facebook|website=[[Facebook]] }}</ref> the Presidente Municipal of Cainta and a former Agente Especial of the Katipunan who had become a pronounced Americanista, strongly advised the Filipino soldiers to surrender. Instead, they shot him. Although wounded, Ampil managed to escape.

On March 3, 1902, major American newspapers including ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported: "…Felizardo, at the head of twenty-five men armed with rifles, entered the town of Cainta and captured the Presidente of Cainta, Señor Ampil, and a majority of the police of the town. Señor Ampil has long been known as an enthusiastic American sympathizer, and it is feared that he may be killed by the enraged ladrones (thieves & land grabbers). A strong force of constabulary has been sent to try to effect his release." In actuality, Timoteo Pasay was the leader of the guerilla band that kidnapped Ampil on Feb 28, 1902.

On March 4, 1902, near the hills of [[Morong, Rizal|Morong]] town, Ampil found an opportunity to escape. A detachment of constabulary was taken from the garrison at Pasig and stationed at Cainta for his protection, he survived the war. And upon retiring from his military and political career, Don Exequiel Ampil together with his wife Doña Priscila Monzon, applied and managed their vast estate from Tramo (Rosario, Pasig) to Cainta River (San Jose, Cainta) up to the Valley Golf Club (Mayamot, Antipolo) down to [[Ortigas Avenue|Ortigas Extension]] (San Isidro, Taytay). The lots were the old and the new Municipal Halls stands, were also part of his estate.

Their son Dr. Jesus Ampil also became a Mayor (grandfather of the Ampil Brothers);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ampilbros.weebly.com/|title=Ampil Brothers Gamefarm}}</ref> whose siblings where Lumen, Atty. Vicente (of [[Pasay]]), Rosario & Jose.

====Inclusion in Rizal province====
On October 12, 1903, under the American rule, Cainta and [[Angono]] were consolidated with Taytay as one government entity.<ref>{{cite PH act|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l89ad|chamber=Act|number=942|date=October 12, 1903|title=An Act Reducing the Thirty-two Municipalities of the Province of Rizal to Fifteen|access-date=February 9, 2024|publisher=Lawyerly}}</ref> On January 1, 1914, it once again became an independent municipality and remained so to this day.

In the 2020 census, the population of Cainta, was 376,933 people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|376,933/42.99|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.

In the 2007 census, it had a population of 304,478. Its population consists of 70% [[Roman Catholic]] Christians, 15% Non-Catholic [[Christians]] (including [[Baptists]], [[Evangelicals]], [[Iglesia ni Cristo]], [[Members Church of God International]], [[Aglipayan]], [[Jesus Is Lord]], and others), 10% [[Muslims]], 3% Chinese [[Buddhists]], and 2% [[Sikhs]]. The people of Cainta are mostly [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]-speaking Filipinos.

A considerable number of the population are descended from Indian soldiers who mutinied against the British Army when the British briefly occupied the Philippines in 1762 to 1763. These Indian soldiers called [[Sepoy]] were [[Tamil people]] from [[Chennai]] and settled in town and intermarried with native women. The Sepoy ancestry of Cainta is still very visible to this day, particularly in Barrio Dayap near Barangay Sto. Niño.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fish|2003|p=158}}</ref>{{clear left}}

Cainta is a highly urbanized town, which has an abundant mix of commercial, industrial, and real estate businesses. As of 2018's Commission on Audit report, the town is the richest municipality in the country in terms of total assets. Cainta continues to attract businesses due to its proximity to [[Manila]] and the town's burgeoning population.

===Native delicacies===
Cainta is known for its native delicacies, a tradition inherited from nearby Antipolo, which is largely a cottage industry. Dating back to the 15th century, it became the town's principal source of income for more than four centuries. ''Suman'' (rice cake wrapped in banana leaf), ''latik'' (boiled down coconut milk used for glazing), [[coconut jam]] and the ''bibingka'' are some of the sweet delicacies that have been popular with visitors to the town.

During the 20th century, Cainta dazzled the whole country when it baked the biggest rice cake ever and the town became known as the "Bibingka Capital of the Philippines". ''Bibingka'' is believed to have been adapted from the Indian cuisine, an influence from its Sepoy population. It comes from the Indian word [[bebinca]] also known as ''bibik'', a dessert made of flour, coconut milk, and egg. The Philippine version is made of rice flour, coconut milk, and salted duck eggs. Butter and sugar are used for glazing after cooking and before serving.{{clear left}}

==Culture==
During Cainta's modernization period, traditions became more glamorous, most especially during the Lenten season. The most noteworthy rituals are the ''Cenakulo'' (a stage play of the passion and death of Christ) and the ''Ang Pagpapapako'' or ''Penetencia'' (a re-enactment of the crucifixion of Christ).

===The Cenakulo===
The ''Senakulo'' in Cainta dates back to 1904. It originated from Barrio Dayap (the entire area now includes Barangays Santa Rosa, Sto Niño and Santo Domingo). At that time, the population consisted of a small group of residents who were mostly related to each other. Since most of the people believed that calamities were brought in by evil spirits, they decided to put up a cross on a vacant lot to counter them. The barrio people paid homage to the cross by lighting it every night. One memorable incident happened during the Lenten season when a strange fragrance supposedly emanated from the cross. The news spread out not only in the barrio but also in the entire town of Cainta.

Believing in the mystery of the cross, many people in Barrio Dayap and the whole town of Cainta have since then vowed to read the ''Pasyon'' (Seven Last Words of Christ) every Lenten season. This has been enriched by an actual portrayal of the Passion of Christ on the streets which was formerly called "Officio". Many problems have been allegedly solved and illnesses cured through the cross as many people continuously believed.

Over the years the followers of the cross have multiplied rapidly. To give deeper meaning to their devotion and showcase their religiosity, they broached the idea of staging the ''Pasyon''. The first stage play was held a few years later, although initially it was limited in scope. It became so popular that the presentation was expanded to include stories from the Old Testament and other stages in the life of Christ and has become known as the ''Cenakulo''. The venue was transferred to an open field in 1966 to accommodate a larger audience.

Krus Sa Nayon, Inc. (KSNI) was established as early as 1900 during and after Spanish era. The group was also known for its extravagant preparation and passion play every night of the Holy Week period. The KSNI cenakulo play was previously held at the Jaika Compound beside the municipal building and Francisco P. Felix Memorial National High School. To date, the play is held at the stage beside the municipal ground, alongside the One Cainta Police Headquarters and One Cainta Fire Department.

Samahang Nazareno Inc. was organized in 1960, developed and enhanced the various aspects of ''cenakulo''. The local Roman Catholic parishioner gave the association its moral and financial support for it believed that it was an effective means of imparting its Christian message to the public.

===Cainta Day===
{{See also|SumBingTik Festival}}
Every December 1, the town celebrates its foundation and feast of [[Our Lady of Light Parish Church|Our Lady of Light]] (Ina ng Kaliwanagan). It is celebrated with its own festival, [[SumBingTik Festival|SumBingTik]] ([[portmanteau]] of [[suman (food)|suman]], [[bibingka]], and [[latik]]), which started around 2014.<ref>[[GMA News and Public Affairs]].
