'''Mombasa''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɒ|m|ˈ|b|æ|s|ə}} {{respell|mom|BASS|ə}}; {{IPAc-en|alsoUS|-|ˈ|b|ɑː|s|ə}} {{respell|-|BAH|sə}}) is a coastal city in southeastern [[Kenya]] along the [[Indian Ocean]]. It was the first capital of [[British East Africa]], before [[Nairobi]] was elevated to capital status in 1907. It now serves as the capital of [[Mombasa County]].

The Mandhry Mosque, built in 1570, has a minaret that contains a regionally specific [[ogee]] arch.

In the late pre-colonial period, it was the metropolis of a plantation society, which became dependent on slave labour based around the ivory trade. Throughout the early modern period, Mombasa was a key node in the complex and far reaching Indian Ocean trading networks. Its key exports then were ivory, [[millet]], [[sesamum]] and [[coconut]]s.

Today, Mombasa is a tourism-based town, home to one of the [[State House (Kenya)|state houses]], with an extra-large [[seaport|port]] and an [[Moi International Airport|international airport]].

=== Ancient and medieval ===
The founding of Mombasa is associated with two rulers: Mwana Mkisi and Shehe Mvita. According to legend, Mwana Mkisi is the original ancestor of Mombasa's oldest lineages within ''Thenashara Taifa'' (or Twelve Nations). Families associated with the Twelve Nations are still considered the original inhabitants of the city. Mwana Mkisi was a queen from the pre-Islamic era, who founded Kongowea, the original urban settlement on Mombasa Island.

Significantly, the names of both the queen and the city have linguistic and spiritual connections with Central Africa. "Mkisi" is considered the personification of ''"ukisi"'', which means "the holy" in [[kiKongo]]. "Kongowea" can similarly be interpreted as the Swahili locative of ''"kongo"'', which denotes the essence of civilizational order in central Africa. These legends can be read as an acknowledgement of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking origins of the [[Swahili people]].

Shehe Mvitaff superseded the dynasty of Mwana Mkisi and established the first permanent stone mosque on Mombasa Island. Mombasa's oldest extant stone mosque, Mnara, was built c. 1300. Shehe Mvita is remembered as a Muslim of great learning and so is connected more directly with the present ideals of Swahili culture that people identify with Mombasa. The ancient history associated with Mwana Mkisi and Shehe Mvita and the founding of an urban settlement on Mombasa Island is still linked to present-day peoples living in Mombasa. The Thenashara Taifa (or Twelve Nations) Swahili lineages recount this ancient history today and are the keepers of local Swahili traditions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Meier |first=Prita |title=Swahili Port Cities: The Architecture of Elsewhere |location=Bloomington |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |year=2016 |pages=33–35}}</ref>

Most of the early information on Mombasa comes from the writings of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese chroniclers]] in the 16th century.

The famous Moroccan scholar and traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] (1304{{Snd}}1368/1369) visited the area during his travels to the [[Swahili Coast]]. He noted the city, although he stayed only one night. He wrote that the people of Mombasa were [[Shafi'i]] Muslims, religious people, trustworthy and righteous. Their mosques were made of wood, expertly built.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Battutah |first1=Ibn |title=The Travels of Ibn Battutah |publisher=Picador |location=London |date=2002 |pages=90 |isbn=9780330418799}}</ref>

The exact founding date of the city is unknown, but it has a long history. Kenyan school history books place the founding of Mombasa as 900 A.D.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Historic Mombasa - The Arabs|url=http://www.friendsofmombasa.com/migration-rich-cultures/the-arabs/|website=www.friendsofmombasa.com|language=en|access-date=2020-05-24|archive-date=15 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201115142042/http://www.friendsofmombasa.com/migration-rich-cultures/the-arabs/|url-status=live}}</ref> It must have been already a prosperous trading town in the 12th century, as the Arab geographer [[Muhammad al-Idrisi|al-Idrisi]] mentions it in 1151. The oldest stone mosque in Mombasa, Mnara, was built {{circa}} 1300. The Mandhry Mosque, built in 1570, has a minaret that contains a regionally specific ogee arch. This suggests that Swahili architecture was an indigenous African product rather than being adopted from non-African Muslims who brought stone architecture to the Swahili Coast.<ref>{{cite book |last=Meier |first=Prita |title=Swahili Port Cities: The Architecture of Elsewhere |location=Bloomington |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=2016 |pages=84–85}}</ref>

During the pre-modern period, Mombasa was an important centre for the trade in spices, gold, and [[ivory]]. Its trade links reached as far as India and China. Oral historians today can still recount this period of local history. Indian history shows that there were trade links between Mombasa and [[Cholas]] of [[South India]]. Throughout the early modern period, Mombasa was a key node in the complex and far-reaching Indian Ocean trading networks. Its key exports were ivory, [[millet]], [[sesamum]] and [[coconut]]s.

Ivory caravans remained a major source of economic prosperity. Mombasa became the major port city of pre-colonial Kenya in the Middle Ages and was used to trade with other African port cities, the [[Greater Iran|Persian Empire]], the Arabian Peninsula, India and China.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6u3CRDloG-YC&pg=PA22|title=Hybrid Urbanism: On the Identity Discourse and the Built Environment|first1=Nezar|last1=AlSayyad|first2=Professor and Chair Center for Middle Eastern Studies Nezar|last2=Alsayyad|date=12 June 2018|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275966126|via=Google Books|access-date=14 January 2016|archive-date=15 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201115142042/https://books.google.com/books?id=6u3CRDloG-YC&pg=PA22|url-status=live}}</ref>

Sixteenth-century Portuguese voyager [[Duarte Barbosa]] wrote, 
<blockquote>"[Mombasa] is a place of great traffic and has a good harbour in which there are always moored small craft of many kinds and also great ships, both of which are bound from [[Sofala]] and others which come from [[Khambhat|Cambay]] and [[Malindi|Melinde]] and others which sail to the island of [[Zanzibar]]."<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-3CPc22nMqIC&pg=PA24|title=The African Dispersal in the Deccan: From Medieval to Modern Times|first=Shanti Sadiq|last=Ali|date=12 June 1996|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=9788125004851|via=Google Books|access-date=14 January 2016|archive-date=15 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201115142042/https://books.google.com/books?id=-3CPc22nMqIC&pg=PA24|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>

===Portuguese domination===
{{see also|Battle of Mombasa (1505)|Battle of Mombasa (1528)}}
[[File:Braun Mombasa UBHD.jpg|thumb|right|Mombasa was under [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese rule]] from 1593 to 1698 and again from 1728 to 1729. Portuguese presence in Kenya lasted from 1498 until 1730.]]
[[Vasco da Gama]] was the first known European to visit Mombasa, receiving a chilly reception in 1498.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Vasco da Gama's Voyage of 'Discovery' 1497 |url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/vasco-da-gamas-voyage-discovery-1497}}</ref> Two years later, the town was sacked by the Portuguese. In 1502, the [[sultanate]] became independent from [[Kilwa Kisiwani]] and was renamed as Mvita (in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]) or Manbasa ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]).

The [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] had since had encounters with the city several times; first under [[Francisco de Almeida]] in 1505, later under [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] in 1522 to quell an attempted mutiny by the sultan's nephew in Pemba and Zanzibar, and finally the destruction of the city under [[Nuno da Cunha]] again in 1528 after the Malindi sultan failed to pay [[tribute]].<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last=Pradines|first=Stéphane|year=2016|title=Portuguese Fortresses in East Africa|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341940582|journal=Fort|publisher=Fortress Study Group|volume=44|pages=52–53|via=ResearchGate}}</ref>

In 1585, a military expedition of the [[Ottoman Empire]], led by Emir 'Ali Bey, successfully captured Mombasa, and other coastal cities in Southeast Africa from the Portuguese.<ref>{{cite book|last=Welch|first=Sidney R.|title=Portuguese rule and Spanish crown in South Africa, 1581–1640|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3Q_AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA29|year=1950|publisher=Juta|isbn=978-0-8426-1588-4 |page=25}}</ref> However, [[Malindi]] remained loyal to Portugal. The Zimba overcame the towns of Sena and Tete on the Zambezi, and in 1587 they took [[Kilwa]], killing 3,000 people. At Mombasa, the Zimba slaughtered the Muslim inhabitants, but they were halted at Malindi by the Bantu-speaking [[Segeju]] and went home. This stimulated the Portuguese to take over Mombasa a third time in 1589, and four years later they built Fort Jesus to administer the region. Between Lake Malawi and the Zambezi mouth, Kalonga Mzura made an alliance with the Portuguese in 1608 and fielded 4,000 warriors to help defeat their rival Zimba, who were led by chief Lundi.

After the building of [[Fort Jesus]], Mombasa was put by the Portuguese under the rule of members of the ruling family of Malindi. In 1631 [[Yusuf ibn al-Hasan|Dom Jeronimo]], the ruler of Mombasa, slaughtered the Portuguese garrison in the city and defeated the relief force sent by the Portuguese. In 1632 Dom Jeronimo left Mombasa and became a pirate. That year the Portuguese returned and established direct rule over Mombasa.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=XvtDAgAAQBAJ&dq=Mazalagem+Nova&pg=PA115 Timothy J. Stapleton, ''A Military History of Africa'', p. 114]</ref>

===Omani rule===
With the [[Siege of Fort Jesus|capture of Fort Jesus]] in 1698, the town came under the influence of the [[Imamate of Oman]], subordinate to the Omani rulers on the island of [[Unguja]], prompting regular local rebellions. Oman appointed three consecutive Governors (Wali in Arabic, [[Liwali]] in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]):
*12 December 1698 – December 1698: Imam Sa'if ibn Sultan
*December 1698 – 1728: Nasr ibn Abdallah al-Mazru'i
*1728–12 March 1728: Shaykh Rumba

Mombasa was briefly returned to Portuguese rule by captain-major Álvaro Caetano de Melo Castro (12 March 1728 – 21 September 1729), then four new Omani Liwali until 1746, when the last of them made it independent again (disputed by Oman), as the first of its recorded Sultans:
*1746–1755: 'Ali ibn Uthman al-Mazru'i
*1755–1773: Masud ibn Nasr al-Mazru'i
*1773–1782: Abdallah ibn Muhammad al-Mazru'i
*1782–1811: Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Mazru'i (born 17–died 1814)
*1812–1823: 'Abdallah ibn Ahmad al-Mazru'i (died 1823)
*1823–1826: Sulayman ibn 'Ali al-Mazru'i

From 9 February 1824 to 25 July 1826, there was a [[British Empire|British]] [[protectorate]] over Mombasa, represented by governors. Omani rule was restored in 1826; seven {{transliteration|ar|liwalis}} where appointed. On 24 June 1837, it was nominally [[annexed]] by [[Said bin Sultan]] of [[Muscat and Oman]].

===British rule and independence===

On 25 May 1887 Mombasa was relinquished to the British East Africa Association, later the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]]. It came under British administration in 1895.<ref>Britannica,
[https://www.britannica.com/place/Mombasa Mombasa] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201115142043/https://www.britannica.com/place/Mombasa |date=15 November 2020 }}, britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref>
It soon became the capital of the [[British East Africa Protectorate]] and the sea terminal of the [[Uganda Railway]], construction of which was started in 1896. Many workers were brought in from [[British India]] to build the railway, and the city's fortunes revived. The [[Sultan of Zanzibar]] formally presented the town to the British in 1898.

Mombasa became the capital of the [[Kenya Colony Protectorate of Kenya]], sometime between 1887 and around 1906.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mombasa.com/v/history/ |title=Mombasa History – Culture, Religion and Lifestyle in Mombasa |publisher=Mombasa.com |access-date=13 August 2012 |archive-date=15 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201115142045/https://www.mombasa.com/v/history/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The capital was later moved because medical officers warned that the ground was swampy, and urged Sir [[James Hayes Sadler]], then Commissioner of the East Africa Protectorate, to plead with London to move the town elsewhere to mitigate potential disease.

In 2018, as part of an effort to increase tourism, Mombasa County Governor Hassan Joho issued a directive requiring that all buildings in the Old Town and the Central Business District be painted white with [[Egyptian blue]] trim and banned all signs from their walls or canopies. Transport, Infrastructure and Public Works County Executive Tawfiq Balala stated that the city wanted to be "the most photographed in Africa".<ref name="tubei-businessinsider">{{cite news|last=Tubei|first=George|date=July 3, 2018|title=Kenya's main tourist hub is changing before our very eyes thanks to a governor's stroke of genius to make it the most photographed city in Africa|publisher=Pulse Live|url=https://www.pulselive.co.ke/bi/lifestyle/hassan-joho-kenyas-main-tourist-hub-is-changing-before-our-very-eyes-thanks-to-a/rb99s85|access-date= April 11, 2021}}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:Mombasa County.jpg|thumb|Map of Mombasa's extent.]]
Being a [[coastal town]], Mombasa is characterised by a flat topography. The town of Mombasa is centred on Mombasa Island, but extends to the mainland. The island is separated from the mainland by two [[Creek (tidal)|creek]]s, [[Port Reitz]] in the south and [[Tudor Creek]] in the north.

== Climate ==
Mombasa has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system|Köppen]]: ''As''). The amount of rainfall essentially depends on the season. The rainiest months are April and May, while rainfall is minimal between January and February.

Located near the equator, Mombasa has only a slight seasonal temperature variation, with high temperatures ranging {{cvt|28.8|-|33.7|C|F}}.

As a seaport, Mombasa is subject to detrimental consequences of a fluctuating climate. In October 2006, Mombasa experienced a large flood that affected 60,000 people.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal |author1=Kebede, A.S. |author2=Nicholls, R.J. |author3=Hanson, S. |author4=Mokrech, M. |title=Impacts of Climate Change and Sea-Level Rise: A Preliminary Case Study of Mombasa, Kenya. |journal=Journal of Coastal Research}}</ref>

[[Climate change in Kenya|Like the rest of Kenya]], climate change is already creating challenges for the city: [[coastal erosion]] has become a problem for infrastructure in Mombasa. Due to [[sea level rise|rising sea levels]], the coastline has been eroding at {{cvt|2.5|-|20|cm}} per year. This has increased the number of annual floods.<ref name=":1" />

== Suburbs ==

Mombasa is located on [[Mombasa Island]] and sprawls to the surrounding mainlands. The island is separated from the mainland by two [[Creek (tidal)|creeks]]: [[Tudor Creek]] and [[Kilindini Harbour]]. It is connected to the mainland to the north by the [[Nyali Bridge]], to the south by the [[Likoni Ferry]], and to the west by the [[Makupa Causeway]], alongside which runs the [[Kenya-Uganda Railway]]. The port serves both Kenya and countries of the interior, linking them to the ocean. The city is served by [[Moi International Airport]] located in the northwest mainland suburb of Chaani.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-04-16 |title=Mombasa {{!}} History & Facts {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Mombasa |access-date=2023-05-25 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref>

[[File:Tudor, Mombasa.jpg|thumb|Tudor, Mombasa]]
[[File:Moon Over Mombasa.jpg|thumb|upright|220px|Moonlight view from Mombasa]]
[[File:Mombasa Harbour.jpg|thumb|Old Town across Mombasa Harbour]]
Kizingo: Considered the prime residential area of Mombasa. The State House of Mombasa, Provincial Headquarters, The Mombasa Law Courts, and the Municipal Council are located in Kizingo. The Aga Khan Academy, Aga Khan High School, Serani Primary School, Serani High School, Santokben Nursery School, Coast Academy, Jaffery Academy, Mombasa Primary School, Loreto Convent, Mama Ngina Girls' High School and the Government Training Institute (GTI) Mombasa are all in Kizingo as well.

Central Business District: The Mombasa central business district across the TSS building roundabout, Moi Avenue, and Nyerere Avenue is densely populated. Organizations such as the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) and businesses such as Banks (ABSA, I&M Ltd, Bank of India Ltd), Insurance Firms (Nomura Insurance Brokers, Masumali Meghji Insurance), and Audit Firms (Anant Bhatt LLP, Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP, Mazars LLP, Deloitte LLP, and PKF LLP) are located here.

[[Kibokoni]]: Part of Old Town with Swahili architecture. Fort Jesus is in Baghani.

Englani: Part of Old town between Kibokoni and Makadara.

Kuze: Part of Old Town with Swahili culture and architecture. Originally flourishing with [[Swahili people]] but becoming a more cosmopolitan neighbourhood.

[[Makadara]]: Part of Old Town consisting of a high number of descendants of [[Baloch people|Baluchi]] former soldiers who settled within this area before it developed into a town. The name is derived from the Arabic words "Qadru r-Rahman" meaning "Decree of (God) the Merciful".

[[Ganjoni]]: Primarily a middle class residential area, home of second biggest dry dock of Africa after the one in South Africa.

[[Tudor, Mombasa|Tudor]]: Another middle class residential area with homes and shops. The [[Technical University of Mombasa]] (TUM) is situated in this neighbourhood.

=== North Coast ===
[[File:Nyali Beach.JPG|thumb|right|Seafront of Nyali Beach, north coast (from the Voyager Resort).]]
[[Nyali]], also considered a prime and up-market residential area, it is on the mainland north of the island and is linked by the [[New Nyali Bridge]]. It has numerous beach front hotels in the area known as the "North Coast". Nyali has two distinct sections – the upmarket Old Nyali and the upcoming New Nyali. For many residents, Nyali has now become a self-contained residential area, with two [[Nakumatt]]s, a multiplex cinema, shopping malls, banks, schools and post offices. This often eliminates the need for residents to cross the bridge and to go into the congested Mombasa city centre. Nyali is home for the Nyali Cinemax complex, Mamba Village, the Nyali Golf Club, and some of the most prestigious academic institutions of the Coast Province.

Kongowea is a densely populated area with 15 villages, two sub-locations and an estimated population of 106,180 residents.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.knbs.or.ke/ |title=2009 Kenya National Bureau of Statistics |access-date=16 September 2010 |archive-date=25 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225015501/http://knbs.or.ke/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Kongowea is a cosmopolitan settlement mainly inhabited by people from mainland who migrated into the city in search of employment, mainly in service and manufacturing sector. The area is adjacent to the rich suburb of Nyali which employs a portion of the village residents. They are mainly hired as cheap labour as watchmen, gardeners, masons for up coming houses and house help. The most well known villages inside Kongowea include Kisumu Ndogo, Shauri Yako and Mnazi Mmoja, despite being located in this prime area, many residents live under extreme conditions – poor sanitation, high crime rate and lack of basic essential amenities like schools, hospitals and tap water. Kongowea is also home to one of the largest open-air markets in the African Great Lakes.

[[Bamburi]] is an outlying township (fifteen minutes drive) along the Malindi road. It is home to [[Bamburi Cement]] factory, the largest cement plant in the East African region. Other notable features in the area are the Jomo Kenyatta public beach, commonly known as Pirates, and [[Haller Park (Kenya)|Haller Park]], a nature trail and wildlife conservatory. Kiembeni Estate, also in the Bamburi area, hosts around 100,000 residents. The estate has its own supermarket, several retail shops, salons and boutiques, and a number of licensed drinking dens. The establishments include The Shilla Bar, Turkey Base, Stars Garden and Sensera pub. Kiembeni is arguably the largest estate in Mombasa, and growing even faster.

Other areas include, [[Shanzu]], Mkomani, [[Bombolulu]], [[Kisauni]] and, across the Mtwapa creek, the popular area of [[Mtwapa]],<ref>[[wikivoyage:Mtwapa|Mtwapa on WikiVoyage]]</ref> which is already located in Kilifi county.

The North Coast has an entertainment industry which attracts locals and tourists.

=== South Coast ===
[[File:Diani Beach Sunrise Kenya.jpg|thumb|[[Diani Beach]]]]
[[Likoni]]: is a lower income and lower-middle-class neighbourhood connected to Mombasa Island by ferry. It is south of Mombasa Island and is made up of mostly Swahili and non-Swahili Bantu tribes. The ferry was the target of the Likoni Riots of 1997. The [[Liwatoni Pedestrian Floating Bridge]] was built and designed to ease pressure on the Likoni ferry crossing by taking up most of the foot traffic, leaving the ferries to serve vehicular and cargo crossing between [[Mombasa Island]] and the South Coast.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/kenya/Kenya0502-06.htm |title=V.

[[Diani Beach]]: a beach resort area situated over the Likoni Ferry on the south coast of Mombasa.<ref>[[V oy: Diani Beach|Diani Beach on WikiVoyage]]</ref> It is located some 36&nbsp;km (22&nbsp;miles) south of Mombasa city on the mainland coast and is a prime resort for many local and international tourists. Diani Beach has an airport at Ukunda town to cater for tourists who fly there directly from Nairobi Wilson or any other airports and airfields in the country.

[[Magongo, Kenya|Magongo]]: is an outlying township 20 minutes driving distance northwest of Mombasa Island, situated on the Nairobi Highway. This fringe community lacks any effective electricity, water or sewer systems, with a general lack of infrastructure. Poverty, lack of sanitation, and unemployment continue to be the greatest issues for the Mikindani Township, which have ensured low health and safety standards for its residents. Poor, lower class housing is widespread, ranging from simple stone, two-storey structures to mud and earth homes fitted with corrugated iron roofs. Much of the community works outside of the township, within Mombasa Island itself as there is a lack of employment and industry. There are a number of small health clinics, shops, and a few public primary schools: Nazarene primary is one school, which is known in particular as being staffed by a revolving volunteer teacher base from Western, and predominately English speaking nations. This small town serves as a link between the city and Moi International Airport. Magongo is also home to the Akamba Handicraft Cooperative.

[[Mikindani, Kenya|Mikindani]], a suburban area: This is an outlying township on the mainland along the Nairobi Highway. It is built in the heavy industrial sections of [[Changamwe]] and mainly accommodate the working class who either work in the industries, the town centre on the Island and the Port at Kilindini harbour.

[[Miritini]]: outlying township on the Mombasa Nairobi Highway which is first growing as a suburban area.

[[Changamwe]]: Industrial area which contains the Kipevu power generation projects, the Kenya Oil Refinery Company facility and housing estates such as Chaani and is the gateway to the Moi International Airport. The area has administrative offices of the D.O and the chiefs who serve the administrative division.

[[Migadini]] & [[Chaani]]: They are two adjacent estate that are located east of Airport road and east of [[Kenya Port Authority]]. They are bordered by Port Reitz, Magongo and KPA

[[Port Reitz]]: Is a suburb on the mainland which contains a beach, oil refineries, housing estates etc. [[Moi International Airport]] and the [[Port Reitz District Hospital]] are in Port Reitz.

Mombasa is an important economic centre in Kenya. In addition to the coffee trade, the food and chemical industries, there is a steel mill, an aluminum rolling mill, an oil refinery and a cement plant. The city is home to the most important seaport in East Africa, [[Kilindini Harbour]], which is also used by the neighbouring countries Tanzania and Uganda for their imports and exports.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

''Kilindini'' is an old Swahili term meaning "deep". The port is so-called because the channel is naturally very deep. Kilindini Harbour is an example of a natural geographic phenomenon called a [[ria]], formed at the end of the [[last glacial period]] when the sea level rose and engulfed a river that was flowing from the mainland.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

Mombasa is a centre of coastal tourism in Kenya. Mombasa Island itself is not a main attraction, although many people visit the Old Town and [[Fort Jesus]].

==== Ferry ====
[[File:Mombasa ferry.JPG|thumb|left|Mombasa ferry]]
There is no bridge between Mombasa Island and the south coast, instead the route is served by [[ferry|ferries]] operated by the Kenya Ferry Service from Kilindini and Mtongwe to [[Likoni]] in the south coast of Mombasa. The last major accident occurred in 1994 when a ferry serving Mtongwe route sank killing more than 270 people.<ref>Francis Thoya, [http://www.nationaudio.com/News/DailyNation/Supplements/wednesday/19112003/story19111.htm "The restless ghosts of Mtongwe"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315134324/http://www.nationaudio.com/News/DailyNation/Supplements/wednesday/19112003/story19111.htm |date=15 March 2017 }}, ''Wednesday'' magazine, 19 November 2003.</ref>

As a result of the increase in more luxurious hotels along the south coast and a lack of a direct bridge linking with Mombasa island, visiting tourists have the option of flying directly from Nairobi into the South Coast airstrip at Ukunda.

The [[Dongo Kundu Bypass Highway]] is under construction (as at 20128). With a total of three bridges, it will finally connect the mainland to the south coast easing the burden on the ferry services. [[Mombasa Gate Bridge]] will connect the mainland to Likoni, this will eliminate the usage of the unsafe ferry which has claimed hundreds of lives.

== Education ==
The major university in the island is the [[Technical University of Mombasa]].
The city has a campus of [[Kenyatta University]].
Other major university campuses include [[University of Nairobi|University of Nairobi-Mombasa campus]], [[Mount Kenya University|Mount Kenya University-Mombasa campus]], [[Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology|JKUAT-Mombasa]], Shanzu Teachers Training College, Mombasa Technical College, Bandari college, Utalii college, and ICS college Mombasa.

International schools which provide IGCSE system (british ciriculum) and USA such as

* Aga Khan Academy
* Mombasa Academy
* Coast Academy
* Oshwal Academy
* Light Academy

All these schools are english based and they provide the same circulum as either British or USA which is recognised internationally.

Many Hindus visit Mombasa to pray at a number of naturally formed [[Lingam]] that have formed in the [[Nyali]] beach Gombeshwar Caves. According to local folklore, the cave-temple was found a long time ago when a group of local herders were puzzled after they noticed that one of their cows regularly released all of her milk at a specific yet random spot on the hills. They are then said to have approached some Hindu families living in the area to ask if they had any idea behind the strange behaviour by the cow. The group then teamed up, made their way to the spot and started digging. That is how they ended up stumbling into the cave where they found a 'Shiva [[Lingam]]' – an abstract representation of the Hindu God Lord Shiva, whose vehicle is [[Nandi (mythology)]]. Hindus worship Lord Shiva by offering milk to a [[Lingam]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/56587-mystic-kenyan-cave-goes-viral-india-video |title=Mystic Kenyan Cave Goes Viral in India &#91;VIDEO&#93; |date=20 August 2020 |access-date=20 August 2020 |archive-date=15 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201115142125/https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/56587-mystic-kenyan-cave-goes-viral-india-video |url-status=live }}</ref>
