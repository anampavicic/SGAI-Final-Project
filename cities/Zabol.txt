Zabol is located near [[Lake Hamun]], in the [[Endorheic basin|endorheic]] [[Sistan Basin|Sīstān Basin]], and the region is irrigated by the [[Helmand River]]. Lake Hamun is a [[hamuns|seasonal lake]] that is often dry.

Zabol is connected by road to Milak and [[Zaranj]] (across the border in Afghanistan). The [[Delaram-Zaranj Highway]] provides road connectivity to the rest of Afghanistan.
