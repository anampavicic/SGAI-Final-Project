==History==
{{See also|Timeline of Geelong history}}

=== Etymology ===
The name Geelong comes from ''Djilang'', used by the Wadawurrung Traditional Owners of the area at the time of settlement.

===Early history and foundation===
[[File:Aerial panorama of Geelong and its heartbeat the home of the Geelong Cats.jpg|thumb|Aerial panorama of Geelong facing the bay. Taken August 2018.]]
The area of Geelong and the [[Bellarine Peninsula]] are the traditional lands of the [[Wadawurrung]] ([[Wathaurong]]) [[Indigenous Australian]] tribe.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Wadawurrung Traditional Owners|url=https://www.wadawurrung.org.au/|access-date=2021-06-01|website=Wadawurrung|language=en}}</ref> The first non-Indigenous person recorded as visiting the region was Lieutenant [[John Murray (Australian explorer)|John Murray]], who commanded the [[brig]] {{HMS|Lady Nelson|1798|6}}.<ref name="story" /> After anchoring outside Port Phillip Heads (the narrow entrance to [[Port Phillip]], onto which both Geelong and [[Melbourne]] now front), on 1 February 1802, he sent a small boat with six men to explore.<ref name="life">{{Cite book|last=Billot|first=C.P.|title=The Life of Our Years|publisher=Lothian Publishing|year=1969|id=National Library of Australia registry number 68-2473 }}</ref> Led by [[John Bowen (colonist)|John Bowen]], they explored the immediate area, returning to ''Lady Nelson'' on 4 February. On reporting favourable findings, ''Lady Nelson'' entered [[Port Phillip]] on 14 February, and did not leave until 12 March. During this time, Murray explored the Geelong area and, whilst on the far side of the bay, claimed the entire area for Britain. He named the bay Port King, after [[Philip Gidley King]],<ref name="life" /> then [[Governor of New South Wales]]. Governor King later renamed the bay Port Phillip after the first governor of New South Wales, [[Arthur Phillip]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.vicnet.net.au/~phillip/env2stud.htm |title=Excerpts from the 'Port Phillip Survey 1957–1963'|work=Port Phillip Conservation Council website|access-date=2007-12-16|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070920091236/http://home.vicnet.net.au/~phillip/env2stud.htm|archive-date=20 September 2007 }}</ref> Arriving not long after Murray was [[Matthew Flinders]], who entered Port Phillip on 27 April 1802.<ref name="story" /> He charted the entire bay, including the Geelong area, believing he was the first to sight the huge expanse of water, but in a rush to reach [[Sydney]] before winter set in, he left Port Phillip on 3 May.

In January 1803, Surveyor-General [[Charles Grimes (surveyor)|Charles Grimes]] arrived at Port Phillip in the [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{HMS|Cumberland|1803|2}} and mapped the area, including the future site of Geelong,<ref name="life" /> but reported the area was unfavourable for settlement and returned to Sydney on 27 February.<ref>{{cite Australian Dictionary of Biography |id=A010443b|title= Grimes, Charles (1772–1858), Online Edition|access-date=2007-12-30}}</ref> In October of the same year, {{HMS|Calcutta|1795|6}} led by Lieutenant Colonel [[David Collins (lieutenant governor)|David Collins]] arrived in the bay to establish the [[Sullivan Bay]] [[penal colony]].<ref name="life" /> Collins was dissatisfied with the area chosen, and sent a small party led by First Lieutenant [[James Hingston Tuckey|J.H. Tuckey]] to investigate alternative sites.<ref>{{cite Australian Dictionary of Biography |id=A010226b|title= Collins, David (1756–1810), Online Edition|access-date=2007-12-30}}</ref> The party spent 22 to 27 October on the north shore of Corio Bay, where the first [[Victorian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] death at the hands of a European in Victoria occurred.<ref name="life" />

The next European visit to the area was by the explorers [[Hamilton Hume]] and [[William Hovell]]. They reached the northern edge of [[Corio Bay]] – the area of Port Phillip that Geelong now fronts – on 16 December 1824,<ref name="hovell">{{cite Australian Dictionary of Biography |id=A010517b|title=Hovell, William Hilton (1786–1875), Online Edition|access-date=2007-12-16}}</ref> and it was at this time they reported that the Aboriginals called the area ''Corayo'', the bay being called ''Djillong''.<ref name="story" /> Hume and Hovell had been contracted to travel overland from Sydney to Port Phillip, and having achieved this, they stayed the night and began their return journey two days later on 18 December.<ref name="hovell" />

The [[convict]] [[William Buckley (convict)|William Buckley]] escaped from the [[Sullivan Bay]] settlement in 1803, and lived among the Wadawurrung people for 32 years on the Bellarine Peninsula.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/portphillip/inter/7335.shtml|title=Reminiscences of James Buckley, communicated by him to George Langhorne, 1837 |work=[[State Library of Victoria]]|access-date=2007-12-16|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124075602/http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/portphillip/inter/7335.shtml |archive-date=24 November 2007|df=dmy}}</ref> In 1835, [[John Batman]] used [[Indented Head]] as his base camp,<ref name="time">{{cite web|url=http://www.zades.com.au/geelong/gdtime.htm|title=Timeline history|work=Geelong and District Historical Resources website |access-date=2007-07-19|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626062822/http://www.zades.com.au/geelong/gdtime.htm |archive-date=26 June 2007}}</ref> leaving behind several employees whilst he returned to [[Tasmania]] (then known as [[Van Diemen's Land]]) for more supplies and his family.

[[File:Geelong in 1840.jpg|thumb|Depiction of early Geelong as a small collection of houses and paddocks by the bay]]
In March 1836, three [[Squatting (pastoral)|squatters]], David Fisher, [[James Strachan (Australian politician)|James Strachan]], and George Russell, arrived on ''Caledonia'' and settled the area.<ref name="life" /> Geelong was first surveyed by Assistant Surveyor W. H. Smythe three weeks after Melbourne, and was gazetted as a town on 10 October 1838.<ref name="story" /> There was already a church, hotel, store, wool store, and 82 houses, and the town population was 545.<ref name="story" /> By 1841, the first wool had been sent to England and a regular [[steamboat|steamer]] service was running between Geelong and Melbourne.<ref name="time" /> Captain [[Foster Fyans]] was commissioned as the local Police [[Magistrate]] in 1837 and established himself on the [[Barwon River (Victoria)|Barwon River]] at the site of the area of present-day [[Fyansford]].<ref name="fyans">{{cite Australian Dictionary of Biography |id=A010389b

Fyans distributed blankets, sugar and flour to these people but soon ordered his soldiers to "click their triggers" at them when a lack of blankets caused anger.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article166561196 |title=Victoria's First Four |newspaper=[[The Newcastle Sun]] |issue=5778 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=20 June 1936 |access-date=30 October 2020 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Fyans constructed a [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] to improve the water supply to the city by preventing the salty lower reaches from mixing with fresh water and pooling water.  In 1839, [[Charles Sievwright]], the newly appointed Assistant Protector of Aborigines (for the western district) sets up camp on the Barwon River near Fyans ford.

The [[Geelong Keys]] were discovered around 1845 by Governor [[Charles La Trobe]] on Corio Bay. They were embedded in the stone in such a way that he believed that they had been there for 100–150 years, possibly dropped by [[Theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia|Portuguese explorers]].<ref>{{cite web

===1860s: The 'Sleepy Hollow'===

The gold rush had seen [[Ballarat]] and [[Bendigo]] grow larger than Geelong in terms of population. Melbourne critics dubbed Geelong 'Sleepy Hollow',<ref name="story" /> a tag that recurred many times in the following years. A number of industries became established in Geelong, including Victoria's first [[Textile manufacturing|woollen mill]] at [[South Geelong]] in 1868. In 1869, the [[clipper]] ''[[Lightning (clipper)|Lightning]]'' caught fire at the Yarra Street pier and was cast adrift in Corio Bay to burn, before being sunk by artillery fire.<ref name="time" /> Improvements to transport saw Geelong emerge as the centre of the [[Western District, Victoria|Western District]] of Victoria, with railway lines extended towards [[Colac, Victoria|Colac]] in 1876, and to [[Bellarine Railway|Queenscliff]] in 1879.<ref name="rg" /> Construction of the [[Corio Bay|Hopetoun shipping channel]] began in 1881 and completed in 1893.<ref name="gex150" />

The [[Geelong Cup]] was first held in 1872, and Victoria's first long-distance [[telephone]] call was made from Geelong to [[Queenscliff, Victoria|Queenscliff]] on 8 January 1878, only one year after the invention of the device itself.<ref name="gex150" /> Geelong was also the home of a prosperous wine industry until the emergence of the sap-sucking insect ''[[Phylloxera|Phylloxera vastatrix]]'' at [[Fyansford]] in 1875, which led to the Victorian Government ordering the destruction of all vines in the Geelong area to prevent the spread of the pest, killing the industry until the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Taborsky |first1=Jan |title=Did you know?

Government housing was constructed in the suburbs of [[East Geelong]], [[Norlane]], [[North Shore, Victoria|North Shore]], and [[Corio, Victoria|Corio]] from the 1950s. The banks of the [[Barwon River (Victoria)|Barwon River]] burst in 1952, inundating nearby [[Belmont, Victoria|Belmont Common]].

Geelong continued to expand with Corio, [[Highton]], and Belmont growing at such a rate that in February 1967, Geelong accounted for 21% of private home development in Greater Melbourne.<ref name="story" /> Private vehicles became the city's major mode of transport. The first [[parking meter]]s in the city were introduced in 1961, new petrol stations were constructed and the city's first supermarket, operated by [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]], opened in 1965.<ref name="story" /> Later, support came for [[Cycling in Geelong]] with Australia's first bike plan in 1977.<sup>[[Cycling in Geelong#cite note-3|[3]]][[Cycling in Geelong#cite note-4|[4]]]</sup>

Industrial growth continued with a second cement works operating at [[Waurn Ponds]] by 1964<ref name="rg" /> and the Alcoa [[Point Henry smelter|Point Henry aluminium smelter]] constructed in 1962.<ref name="psu" />

[[Government of Australia|Federal government]] policy changes on [[tariff]] protection led to the closure of many Geelong industrial businesses from the 1970s.

Geelong's new Library and Heritage Centre opened to the public in November 2015. The new addition to Geelong offers new research facilities, display areas and hosts Geelong's extensive heritage, modern and Indigenous. The new library was awarded the Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture<ref>{{cite web|url=http://armarchitecture.com.au/news/geelong-library-wins-the-sir-zelman-cowen-award/|title=Geelong Library wins the Sir Zelman Cowen Award / ARM Architecture|website=armarchitecture.com.au}}</ref> in 2016.

The redevelopment of Malop street will see the installation of separated bike lanes from both pedestrians and local traffic by greenery, the design is an Australian first. This project includes the installation of art sculptures and street art throughout the city centre. Major redevelopments are also occurring at Johnstone Park, with a new raingarden installation, and Lt Malop Street is seeing more upgrades.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Planning |date=2016-12-20 |title=Revitalising Central Geelong |url=https://www.planning.vic.gov.au/policy-and-strategy/revitalising-central-geelong |access-date=2022-10-16 |website=Planning |language=en |archive-date=16 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221016024254/https://www.planning.vic.gov.au/policy-and-strategy/revitalising-central-geelong |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In the suburbs Geelong West's Pakington Street is seeing major upgrades to its street appeal, with new plantings and upgrades to many of the shops. Manifold Heights' Shannon Avenue will see redevelopment to make it more pedestrian friendly. To Geelong's north, [[Rippleside]] is undergoing major changes, with the ongoing development of Balmoral Quay which will see Rippleside Park and nearby St Helens Park connected via a waterfront footpath as well as beach restoration and a boat dock expansion.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Duncan |first=Brad |title=Maritime Infrastructure Heritage Project Stage Two: Geelong (Report of Regional Landscape Archaeological and Historical Survey - Updated to 2006) |url=https://www.academia.edu/9986060}}</ref>

Geelong is located on the shores of the western tip of Corio Bay, a southwestern [[inlet]] of [[Port Phillip Bay]].  During clear weather, the distant Melbourne skyline is visible from higher areas of Geelong when viewed across the waters of Port Phillip.  The [[Barwon River (Victoria)|Barwon River]] flows through the southern fringe of the [[Geelong city centre]] before entering [[Lake Connewarre]] and the [[estuary]] at [[Barwon Heads]] before draining into the [[Bass Strait]].<ref name="barwon">{{Cite book

Development in Geelong started on the shores of Corio Bay in what is now the inner city. Development later spread to the south towards the Barwon River, and the hill of [[Newtown, Victoria|Newtown]] and [[Geelong West]]. Major development south of the river in [[Belmont, Victoria|Belmont]] did not start until the 1920s, stimulated by the construction of a new bridge over the river in 1926, and the extension of the [[Trams in Geelong|Geelong tramway]] system in 1927.<ref name="gex150" /> Industrial areas were traditionally located on the Corio Bay for port access,<ref name="gex-plan-industry">{{cite web

In the interwar and post-World War II years, [[heavy industry]] continued to establish itself in the flatter northern suburbs,<ref name="gex-plan-industry" /> where today industries such as the [[Geelong Oil Refinery]] and [[Ford Australia|Ford]] engine plant reside.<ref name="rgnog" /> Residential development also spread to Corio and Norlane in the north, with new [[Housing Commission of Victoria]] estates built to cater for employees of the new industries. From the 1960s, residential growth spread to the [[Highton]] hills in the south and North Geelong following prosperous industries like the gasworks, followed by [[Grovedale]] in the 1970s. A number of [[light industrial]] areas were also established in [[Breakwater, Victoria|Breakwater]], [[Moolap]] and [[South Geelong]].<ref name="gex-plan-industry" />

Changing cargo-handling methods at the [[Port of Geelong]] left woolstores in inner Geelong unused, [[Urban Renewal|redevelopment]] beginning in the 1980s with the expansion of [[Westfield Geelong]] towards Corio Bay, and culminating in the [[Waterfront Geelong]] development.<ref>{{cite web

[[File:Geelong A Power Station, 1948.jpg|thumb|left|The former Geelong A power station, now part of Westfield Geelong]]
Water storage and supply in Geelong is managed by [[Barwon Water]], a Victoria government-owned urban water corporation. Geelong is supplied with water from three river systems: the Barwon, the East Moorabool, and the West Moorabool Rivers. The catchment areas are the Brisbane Ranges to Geelong's north-west, and the [[Otway Ranges]] to the south-west. The first water supplies to Geelong were from the Stony Creek reservoirs near [[Steiglitz, Victoria|Steiglitz]], but, as of 2010, Geelong, together with Ballarat, consumes about 70% of the Moorabool River's water flow.<ref>{{cite web|title=Water issues and environmental flows|url=http://www.wombatforestcare.org.au/index.php?page=Water_Issues_and_Environmental_Flows|work=Wombat Forestcare Inc|access-date=6 October 2012|first=Alison|last=Pouliot|year=2007–2010}}</ref> Sewage from Geelong and district is [[sewage treatment|treated]] at the Black Rock Treatment Plant at [[Breamlea]] and then discharged into [[Bass Strait]].

Geelong was first supplied with electricity in 1902 when the [[Geelong Power Station]] opened on the corner of Yarra and Brougham Streets. Later known as Geelong A, the power station was rebuilt in 1920 to increase the capacity, with the station continuing operation until 1961. In 1936, Geelong was connected to the state [[electrical grid]]. The Geelong B power station at [[North Geelong]] opened in 1954,<ref name="psu">{{Cite book

The supply of piped [[coal gas]] in Geelong started in 1860 by the [[Geelong Gas Company]]. The [[gasworks]] were located in North Geelong next to the [[North Geelong railway station]].<ref>The Geelong Gas Company 1858–1958: 100 years of public service and progressive development</ref> Geelong was converted to [[natural gas]] in 1971, with the Geelong Gas Company being taken over by the [[Gas & Fuel Corporation of Victoria]] on 30 June 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.delisted.com.au/Company/3376/GEELONG%20GAS%20COMPANY%20LIMITED |title=GEELONG GAS COMPANY LIMITED |work=deListed website |access-date=2007-08-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830132222/http://www.delisted.com.au/Company/3376/GEELONG%20GAS%20COMPANY%20LIMITED |archive-date=30 August 2007 }}</ref>

[[Port Phillip Ferries]] began operating twice daily services between [[Portarlington, Victoria|Portarlington]] and Melbourne [[Docklands, Victoria|Docklands]] in November 2016. Three years later overcrowding on trains led to a similar service being introduced from Geelong to Docklands. The services are popular with both tourists and commuters, providing an alternative access for Geelong and the Bellarine Peninsula to Melbourne. The {{Convert|36|m|4=-long|adj=mid}} catamaran ferries seat over 400 passengers, provide a comfortable vantage point to enjoy the sights of Port Phillip. The introduction of the Portarlington service led to a major revamp of the local pier, with pier extensions and a protective rock wall installed.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

On 23 October 2022 the Tasmanian ferry service, the [[Spirit of Tasmania]], started operating from a new terminal in [[North Geelong]] rather than from [[Port Melbourne]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.spiritoftasmania.com.au/geelong-terminal | title=Introducing Spirit of Tasmania Quay }}</ref>

Taxi services in Geelong are provided by Geelong Taxi Network, a newly formed depot following the effective merger of Bay City Cabs and Geelong Radio Cabs in July 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thegeelongtimes.com.au/news/View_Item.asp?task=edit&id=108 |title=2 into 1 Geelong taxi service |work=Geelong Times |date=2007-05-02 |access-date=2012-05-14 |archive-date=14 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314042120/http://www.thegeelongtimes.com.au/news/View_Item.asp?task=edit&id=108 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
The majority of the network covers the city and suburban areas of the city, with "urban" classification for the vehicles in use. The [[Bellarine Peninsula]], and Torquay areas, although part of Geelong Taxi Network, are both covered by separate "country" classification taxis. Often, disputes occur in regards to different taxis from one licence area, picking up work from either of the other two licence areas, which is illegal in most circumstances under current taxi regulations in Victoria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2008/09/25/18765_news.html |title=Move to Ban Bellarine Taxis in Geelong |work=[[Geelong Advertiser]]}}</ref> Call centre and radio dispatch services for the new combined network are provided by Silver Top Taxis in Melbourne.
