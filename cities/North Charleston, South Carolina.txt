==History==
===1680–1901: Plantations===
From the 17th century until the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] cultivated commodity crops, such as rice and indigo. Some of the plantations in what is now North Charleston were:

[[File:Andre Michaux North Charleston South Carolina.jpg|thumb|French Botanical Garden historical marker, located off Aviation Avenue]]
* Archdale Hall Plantation – dating from 1680, Archdale Hall was on the [[Ashley River (South Carolina)|Ashley River]]. By 1783, it had grown to almost {{convert|3000|acre|km2}}. Its primary crops were [[indigo dye|indigo]] and [[rice]]. The plantation was the longest family-owned plantation in South Carolina. It has since been redeveloped into the Archdale subdivision. (Archdale subdivision is not in corporate city limits of, but is surrounded by North Charleston)
* Camp Plantation – dating from 1705, Camp Plantation covered around {{convert|1000|acre|km2}}.
* Elms Plantation – dating from 1682, Elms Plantation was founded by Ralph Izard. Its principal crop was rice. It covered nearly {{convert|4350|acre|km2}}, stretching across parts of what are now the cities of [[Goose Creek, South Carolina|Goose Creek]] and North Charleston. [[Charleston Southern University]] is on part of the original plantation lands.
* French Botanical Garden –  established between 1786 and 1796, this small plantation/garden area of {{convert|111|acre|km2}} was owned and maintained by the French botanist [[André Michaux]]. It was closed by Michaux's son in 1803. The garden was near what is today the [[Charleston International Airport]], and the parkway connecting Dorchester Road with International Boulevard is named in his honor.
* Marshlands, ''Mons Repos'' and Retreat plantations – the Retreat Plantation dates from 1672 and the Marshlands Plantation dates from 1682. ''Mons Repos'' was developed around 1798. The land from all three plantations was acquired by the federal government for development of the [[Charleston Naval Base]] and [[Charleston Naval Shipyard]]. The [[National Register of Historic Places listings in North Charleston, South Carolina|Marshlands Plantation's]] main house has been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. To preserve the house, it was moved in 1961 to land at Fort Johnson on [[James Island (South Carolina)|James Island]] and is currently used as offices for the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources.<ref>[http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/charleston/S10817710052/index.htm National Register Properties in South Carolina]</ref>
* Oak Grove Plantation – dating from 1680, Oak Grove originally covered {{convert|960|acre|km2}} along the [[Cooper River (South Carolina)|Cooper River]]. By 1750, its owners had expanded the plantation to about {{convert|1127|acre|km2}}.
* Tranquil Hill Plantation – started in 1683, Tranquil Hill was originally known as White Hall Plantation, a name it kept until 1773. Its principal crop was rice. It encompassed about {{convert|526|acre|km2}}. In the late 20th century, it was redeveloped as the Whitehall residential subdivision.<ref>Trinkley, Michael and Debi Hacker (February 2008). [http://www.chicora.org/pdfs/Chicora%20CD%20data.pdf Tranquil Hill Plantation: the most charming inland place]. Chicora Foundation, Inc. Retrieved January 14, 2011.</ref>
* Windsor Hill Plantation – established in 1701, Windsor Hill was an inland rice plantation that covered nearly {{convert|1348|acre|km2}}; parts of the cities of Goose Creek and North Charleston now occupy some of this area.<ref name="Society1918">{{cite book| author=South Carolina Historical Society| editor=Mabel Louise Webber| title=The South Carolina historical and genealogical magazine| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P7R659ccPdkC&pg=RA1-PA29| access-date=October 13, 2011| volume=19| year=1918| publisher=South Carolina Historical Society| pages=29–31}}</ref> General [[William Moultrie]], victor at the [[Battle of Sullivan's Island]] in 1776 and [[governor of South Carolina|governor]] from 1785 to 1787 and 1792–94, was originally buried here.

The large plantations were subdivided into smaller farms in the late 19th century as the urban population began moving northward. Due to the large labor forces of enslaved African Americans who worked these properties for over two centuries, the population of Charleston County in 1870 was 73 percent black; they were [[freedmen]] by this time. After the Civil War, [[phosphate]] fertilizer plants were developed, with extensive strip mining between the Ashley River and Broad Path (Meeting Street Road). The main route for transportation of these phosphates eventually became known as Ashley Phosphate Road.

===1901–1972: Incorporation===
Since the early 20th century, the section of unincorporated Charleston County that later became North Charleston had been designated by Charleston business and community leaders as a place for the development of industry, military and other business sites. The first industry started in this area was the E.P. Burton Lumber Company. In 1901, the [[Charleston Naval Shipyard]] was established with agreements between the federal government and local Charleston city leaders. Shortly thereafter, the General Asbestos and Rubber Company (GARCO) built the world's largest [[asbestos]] mill under one roof.

In 1912, a group of businessmen from Charleston formed a development company that bought the E.P. Burton Lumber Company tract and began to lay out an area for further development. The Park Circle area was one of the first to be designed and developed, allocating sections for industrial, commercial, and residential usage. Park Circle was planned as one of only two English [[garden city movement|Garden Style]] communities in the US, and most of the original planning concept remains today. Some of the streets in the area still bear the names of these original developers: Durant, Buist, Mixon, Hyde, and O'Hear. During [[World War II]], substantial development occurred as the military bases and industries expanded, increasing the personnel assigned there. New residents moved to the region to be closer to their work.

From World War II through the 1960s, many whites who lived in this region (referred to by Charlestonians as the North Area) were unhappy about the way parts of their community were being developed. They wanted the citizens in the area to have direct control over future development. African Americans were still excluded from the political system due to the state's 1895 [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchising]] constitution. Many white Democrats' attempts to create an independent city were defeated via court rulings.

The [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] gave the federal government the means to enforce citizens' constitutional rights, and African Americans in South Carolina gradually reclaimed their franchise. As a means of bringing the government closer to the people, an incorporation [[referendum]] was held on April 27, 1971. On June 12, 1972, after a series of legal battles, the [[South Carolina Supreme Court]] upheld the referendum results. North Charleston became a city and elected [[John E. Bourne Jr.]] as its first mayor.

===1972–1982: First decade===
When North Charleston was incorporated on June 12, 1972, it consisted of several areas, including the Russelldale, Ferndale, Morningside, Liberty Park, Palmetto Heights, Singing Pines, Dewey Hill, Liberty Homes and John C. Calhoun Homes neighborhoods. Within the first week of operation, the city passed a 61-page Code and signed a five-year lease for 308 Montague Avenue for $300.00 per month. Also during June, the city hired a police chief, and treasurer and annexed its first industry, which was Textone Incorporated Plywood, [[Westvaco]]. On June 21, a ribbon was cut on the first city park on Virginia Avenue. At the end of the first month, the city officials reached an agreement for garbage collection and fire protection by the local public service district. The month concluded with the city's first big annexation, south of Bexley Street between Spruill Avenue and the [[Charleston Naval Shipyard]]. By December, North Charleston had become the fourth-largest city in the state after annexing the Naval Base, the Air Force Base and the [[Charleston International Airport]].<ref name="retail">Wise, Warren (March 22, 2008).

In February 1973, North Charleston doubled its area through annexation, and in March expanded into Berkeley County. In May 1973, the city launched its new police department, which included 21 officers and six cars. By the end of North Charleston's first year, the population had increased from 22,000 to 53,000, largely through annexation. Through continued growth and the development of 20 churches, a 62-store shopping mall and other large tracts of residential neighborhoods, the city was ranked as the third-largest city in South Carolina on July 3, 1976.

On June 12, 1982, North Charleston had a population of 65,000 in a {{convert|30.5|sqmi|adj=on}} area. In ten years, the city's growth rate was 250 percent. It had made $15 million in capital investments; $1.95 million invested in parks and recreation facilities, and $2.28 million in economic development.

===1982–1996===
In 1983, North Charleston became the first city in South Carolina to implement a [[computer-aided dispatch]] system. Baker Hospital opened a new facility on the banks of the Ashley River. Plans were revealed in 1985 for the {{convert|400|acre|km2|adj=on}} Centre Pointe retail development.

By 1986, North Charleston's population had reached 78,000, spanning {{convert|47|sqmi|km2}}. A monument to honor [[Vietnam veteran]]s was erected and dedicated in front of City Hall, where it stood for over 20 years before being moved to Patriots Point in 2008. The city celebrated its 15th anniversary the next year, marked by such events as the opening of the Northwoods Center shopping complex and the development of a beach in the middle of the city with the opening of Treasure Lake.

In September 1989, [[Hurricane Hugo]] devastated the area, causing a total of over $2.8 billion in damage to the [[South Carolina Lowcountry]].

In 1991, John E. Bourne, Jr., lost his bid for a sixth term as mayor to [[Bobby Kinard]], who became the city's second mayor. Kinard's tenure as mayor was tumultuous and was marked by repeated conflict with the City Council; its members stripped Kinard of his mayoral powers during a council meeting. Kinard resigned in 1994 on the grounds that his relationship with the council was damaged irreparably.<ref name=kinard>Smith, Glenn (June 19, 2010).

Keith Summey]] was elected the city's third mayor to fill the vacant seat. Kinard returned to his law practice. In 2023, former North Charleston Police Chief Reggie Burgess was elected mayor, the first Black person to serve in the role.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Brams |first=Sophie |date=November 7, 2023 |title=Reggie Burgess wins North Charleston mayor's race |work=WCBD-TV |url=https://www.counton2.com/news/your-local-election-hq/reggie-burgess-wins-north-charleston-mayors-race/ |access-date=December 23, 2023}}</ref>

In 1993 a squadron of [[C-17 Globemaster III]] aircraft was established at [[Charleston Air Force Base]], bringing more residents and jobs. The [[North Charleston Coliseum]] opened, and the [[South Carolina Stingrays]] of the [[ECHL]] began play later that year.

The [[Charleston Naval Base]] ranked as the largest employer of civilians in South Carolina into the 1990s. The influence of Lowcountry legislators and the threat of nuclear attack played an important role in keeping North Charleston's bases open in the face of periodic attempts at closure.

In the early 1990s, with the resolution of the [[Cold War]] and the fall of the Soviet Union, plus impending defense budget cuts, the Charleston Navy Base was proposed for closure. In 1993, the Charleston Naval Base was given a closure date of April 1, 1996. Given its annual expenditures of approximately 1.4 billion dollars in the region, the base's closing represented a major loss of jobs and a blow to the entire Tri-County economy. Over the years, billions of federal dollars had flowed into the region's economy and hundreds of thousands of jobs were filled by military and civilian personnel,<ref>Joyce, Terry (March 16, 1996).

After the Charleston Naval Base and Charleston Naval Shipyard closed, parts of the base and dry docks were leased to various government and private businesses. Community parks for North Charleston were established on old base grounds, including Riverfront Park.

After years of development, community input and revisions, the Noisette Community Master Plan for the old naval base was finalized in a contractual agreement in early 2004. The plan sought to preserve historic architectural styles, neighborhood diversity, and the area's unique social fabric. It is also intended to restore environmental stability and beauty, attract jobs, improve services such as education and health care, reduce dependence on car travel, promote recreation, eliminate the foundations of crime and poverty, and strengthen residents' sense of pride.

In 2005, city officials discovered that Noisette had borrowed $3 million against the land on the former base without their knowledge. The next year, Noisette borrowed $23.7 million from Capmark Investing Group, using most of its remaining land on the base as collateral. Noisette failed to make timely repayment to Capmark, and the property went into [[foreclosure]]. Noisette representatives insisted at the time that they would be able to repay Capmark and make good on their vision for redeveloping the old Navy base.<ref name="noisette">Bartelme, Tony and Doug Perdue (November 22, 2009).

In July 2014, the City of North Charleston and Chicora Garden Holdings, LLC announced the planned redevelopment of the old Naval Hospital property, to be known as the Chicora Life Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northcharleston.org/News/Chicora-Life-Center-announced.aspx|title=Chicora Life Center announced|publisher=City of North Charleston|date= July 7, 2014|access-date=October 10, 2015}}</ref> As part of that announcement, Chicora Garden Holdings announced an initial $3 million investment in the project. The City of North Charleston announced that the Chicora Life Center "will feature myriad social, government, non-profit and care facilities—all in one building conveniently located in the heart of Charleston County."

On October 7, 2014, ''Palmetto Business Daily'' reported that UC Funds was funding $13.9 million in loans to the Chicora Life Center for completion of the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://palmettobusinessdaily.com/stories/510641751-uc-funds-announces-13-9-million-loan-for-chicora-life-center-project|title= UC Funds announces $13.9 million loan for Chicora Life Center project| publisher= Palmetto Business Daily|date= October 7, 2015|access-date=October 10, 2015}}</ref> That newspaper also reported that Bennett Hofford Construction Company also completed Phase 1 of a new Heating, Ventilation and Air Condition (HVAC) for the portion of the building leased by the County of Charleston.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://palmettobusinessdaily.com/stories/510641617-bennett-hofford-completes-phase-i-hvac-work-on-chicora-life-center|title= Bennett Hofford completes Phase I HVAC work on Chicora Life Center | publisher= Palmetto Business Daily|date= October 7, 2015|access-date=October 10, 2015}}</ref>

Discussion between city and state officials regarding the industrial development of the remaining portions of the former base stalled in 2009, primarily due to a dispute over rail access to a proposed intermodal terminal to occupy the central portion of the area. Representatives of the state government sought to have rail access from both the north and south. This notion was contradicted by Mayor Summey, who insisted that the northern rail access be abandoned to avoid heavy rail traffic through the slowly revitalizing Park Circle neighborhood.<ref name="noisette" />

In October 2009, [[Boeing]] announced the selection of North Charleston for its new [[787 Dreamliner]] aircraft assembly and delivery prep center. This positioned North Charleston as one of the major aircraft centers of the world, with the potential for thousands of new jobs to provide quality work for residents of the city and the entire Tri-County area.<ref name="landing">McDermott, John P. and Yvonne Wenger (October 29, 2009).

The 2010 ''Congressional Quarterly Press'' list of America's 400 most dangerous cities placed North Charleston at No. 63.

City officials attributed the drop to the hard work of the North Charleston Police Department and the cooperation of city residents through "community policing" programs.<ref name="lowercrime">Hicks, Brian (November 26, 2010).

===Fire department===
The first fire department founded in the area to become North Charleston was the St. Phillip's and St. Michael's Fire Department in 1935, made up of volunteers. They had one station and one engine. The North Charleston Fire Department, also a volunteer group, was formed in 1937 with one station and one engine. In 1959, the departments merged to become the North Charleston Consolidated Fire Department. NCFD became a paid service in 1962, at which time all volunteers were released. They formed the organization today known as the Charleston County Volunteer Rescue Squad.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=The History of NCFD – City of North Charleston, SC |url=https://www.northcharleston.org/government/fire-department/the-history-of-ncfd-2/ |access-date=November 6, 2022 |language=en-US}}</ref>

The two departments were merged in 1996 as the North Charleston Fire Department. It had a total of 10 fire stations, 10 engines, 3 ladder trucks and 2 squads at that time.<ref name=":0" />
