==History==
[[File:Burg Kariya Plan.jpg|thumb|200px|Kariya castle]]

===Feudal period===
Kariya was a [[castle town]] in the [[Sengoku period]], in an area contested between the [[Imagawa clan]], [[Oda clan]] and various local warlords, including the [[Mizuno clan]] and [[Matsudaira clan]].

===Early modern period===
[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]’s maternal grandfather [[Mizuno Tadamasa]] rebuilt [[Kariya Castle]] in the mid-16th century. 
The Mizuno clan shifted allegiances adroitly between the [[Imagawa clan]] to [[Oda Nobunaga]] and to [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], who relocated the clan to [[Ise Province]].

However, [[Mizuno Katsunari]], the grandson of Tadamasa was allowed to return to the clan's ancestral territories by Ieyasu after the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] as ''[[daimyō]]'' of [[Kariya Domain]], a [[han system|feudal han]] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].
The domain was reassigned to numerous clans during the [[Edo period]], but was retained by the [[Doi clan]] from 1734 until the [[Meiji Restoration]].

===Late modern period===
After the Meiji Restoration, Kariya Town was created within [[Hekikai District, Aichi|Hekikai District]], Aichi Prefecture with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on October 1, 1889.
The town prospered as a center for commerce, [[sake]] production, [[sericulture]] and ceramics due to its location on the main railway routes.
The [[Yosami Transmitting Station]], located in Kariya, was Japan's tallest structure when completed in 1929.

===Contemporary history===
Kariya achieved city status on April 1, 1950. The city expanded by annexation of neighboring Fujimatsu and most of Yosami villages on April 1, 1955.
Control of the Yosami Transmitting Station was returned to Japan from the [[United States Navy]] in 1994, and the former facility is now a city park.

==Government==
[[File:Kariya City Hall 2020-10 ac (1).jpg|thumb|200px|Kariya city hall]]
Kariya has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city legislature of 28 members. The city contributes two members to the Aichi Prefectural Assembly.  In terms of national politics, the city is part of Aichi District 13 of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].
