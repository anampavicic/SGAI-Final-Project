The population was 132,524 as of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]]. Located in the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] in [[West Texas]], Midland is a major center for [[Petroleum in the United States|American oil and natural gas production]].

Midland is the principal city of the [[Midland, Texas metropolitan statistical area]], which includes all of Midland County, the population of which was 169,983 in the 2020 U.S. Census.<ref>US Census, 2020 Census Report, Quick Facts, Midland County https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/midlandcountytexas</ref> The metropolitan area is part of the larger [[Midland–Odessa|Midland–Odessa combined statistical area]], which had a population of 340,391 in the 2020 census.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=S1101%3A%20HOUSEHOLDS%20AND%20FAMILIES&g=330XX00US372&y=2020|title=Households and Families|website=census.gov|access-date=July 18, 2022}}</ref> Residents of Midland are referred to as 'Midlanders'.

Midland was founded as the midway point between [[Fort Worth]] and [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] on the [[Texas and Pacific Railway|Texas and Pacific Railroad]] in 1881. The city has many connections to the [[Bush family]]; it was the onetime home of former [[President of the United States|Presidents]] [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[George W. Bush]] and the hometown of former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Laura Bush]]. The [[George W. Bush Childhood Home]] is located in Midland.

[[File:Bank of America Building, Midland, Texas.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Bank of America Building (Midland)|Bank of America Building]], Midland's tallest]]

Midland was established in June 1881 as Midway Station, on the [[Texas and Pacific Railway]]. Its name came from its central location between Fort Worth and El Paso, but because there were already other towns in Texas named Midway, the city changed its name to Midland in January 1884 when it was granted its first post office.

Midland became the county seat of Midland County in March 1885, when that county was first organized and separated from [[Tom Green County, Texas|Tom Green County]]. By 1890, it had become one of the state's most important cattle shipping centers. The city was incorporated in 1906, and by 1910 established its first fire department, along with a new water system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdm03 |title=MIDLAND, TX &#124; The Handbook of Texas Online&#124; Texas State Historical Association (TSHA) |publisher=Tshaonline.org |access-date=May 29, 2014}}</ref>

Midland was changed significantly by the discovery of [[oil drilling|oil]] in the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] in 1923 when the Santa Rita No. 1 well began producing in [[Reagan County]], followed shortly by the [[Yates Oil Field]] in [[Iraan, Texas|Iraan]]. Midland became the West Texas oil fields' administrative center. During [[World War II]], it had the nation's largest bombardier training base. A second boom began after the war, with the discovery and development of the [[Spraberry Trend]], still the country's third-largest oil field by total reserves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/data_publications/crude_oil_natural_gas_reserves/current/pdf/appb.pdf |title=Top 100 Oil and Gas Fields |access-date=May 23, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515062119/http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/data_publications/crude_oil_natural_gas_reserves/current/pdf/appb.pdf |archive-date=May 15, 2009 }}</ref> Yet another boom period took place during the 1970s, with the high oil prices associated with the oil and energy crises. Today, the Permian Basin produces one fifth of the nation's total petroleum and [[natural gas]] output.

Midland's economy still relies heavily on petroleum, but the city has also become a regional telecommunications and distribution center. By August 2006, a busy period of crude oil production had caused a significant workforce deficit. According to the Midland Chamber of Commerce, at that time there were almost 2,000 more jobs available in the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] than there were workers to fill them.

In 1959, [[John Howard Griffin]] wrote a history of Midland, ''Land of the High Sky.''

=== ''Avery v. Midland County'' ===
In 1967, the U.S. Supreme Court heard the case ''[[Avery v. Midland County]]''. Midland mayor Hank Avery had sued Midland County, challenging the electoral-districting scheme in effect for elections to the County Commissioner's Court. The county districts geographically quartered the county, but Midland, in the northwestern quarter, had 97% of the county's population. A judge, elected on an at-large basis, provided a fifth vote, but the result was that the three rural commissioners, representing only 3% of the county's population, held a majority of the votes.

The Court held that the scheme violated the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]'s [[Equal Protection clause]]. A dissenting minority held that this example of the [[Earl Warren|Warren]] Court's policy of [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporation]] at the local-government level exceeded its [[U.S. Constitution|constitutional]] authority.

== Geography ==
Midland is in the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] in the [[West Texas]] plains.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has an area of 71.5&nbsp;square miles (185.2&nbsp;km{{sup|2}}), of which 71.3&nbsp;square miles (184.7&nbsp;km{{sup|2}}) is land and 0.2&nbsp;square mile (0.5&nbsp;km{{sup|2}}) (0.28%) is water.

=== Climate ===
Midland has a [[desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSh'' or ''BSk'') with hot summers and cool to mild winters. It occasionally has cold waves during the winter, but rarely sees extended periods of below-freezing cold. Midland receives approximately {{convert|13.5|in|mm}} of precipitation per year, much of which falls in the summer. Highs exceed {{convert|90|°F|0}} on 115 days per year and {{convert|100|°F|0}} on 24 days while lows fall to {{convert|32|°F|0}} or below on 58 days.<ref name = NWS /><ref name = NOWData />

=== Cityscape ===
{{See also|Category:Buildings and structures in Midland, Texas}}
Nicknamed "The Tall City", Midland has long been known for its downtown skyline. Most of downtown Midland's major office buildings were built during a time of major [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] oil and gas discoveries. The surge in energy prices in the mid-1980s sparked a building boom downtown. For many years, the 22-story [[Wilco building|Wilco Building]] in downtown was the tallest building between [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. Today, the tallest is the 24-story [[Bank of America Building (Midland)|Bank of America Building]], at {{convert|332|ft|m}}. Four buildings over {{convert|500|ft|m}} tall were planned in the 1980s, including one designed by architect [[I.M. Pei]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uwm.edu/SARUP/faculty/cardillo.htm |title=List of Architectural designs, including MGF Building by I. M.

The great oil bust of the mid-1980s killed any plans for future skyscrapers. A private development group was planning to build [[Energy Tower (Midland, Texas)|Energy Tower]] at City Center, which was proposed to be 870 feet tall, with 59 floors (six floors underground and 53 above). If it had been built, it would have been Texas's sixth-tallest building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mywesttexas.com/top_stories/article_ac0f72d2-115e-598d-be9d-cc0d8ed838b6.html|title=Architect: 'Energy Tower starts ripple effect of downtown activity'|date=April 2, 2013}}</ref>
