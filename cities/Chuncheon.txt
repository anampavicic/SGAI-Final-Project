'''Chuncheon''' ({{Korean|hangul=춘천|hanja=春川市}}; {{IPA|ko|tɕʰun.tɕʰʌn}}; literally ''spring river''), formerly romanized as '''Ch'unch'ŏn''', is the capital of [[Gangwon-do (South Korea)|Gangwon Province]] in [[South Korea]]. The city lies in the north of the country, located in a basin formed by the [[Soyang River]] and [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]]. There are some large lakes around the city, most notably [[Soyang Lake]] and [[Uiam Lake]] (or Uiam Dam). The area has small river islands, such as Sangjungdo, Ha-Jungdo, Bungeodo, and Wido.

It is a popular destination among east Asian tourists as it was featured in the popular Korean drama ''[[Winter Sonata]]'' (겨울연가). It is where the resort island of [[Namiseom]] is located. Also, Gangwon Provincial Office is located in the city.

==History==

The area now occupied by the city was first settled several thousands of years ago, in prehistoric times, as demonstrated by stone-age archaeological evidence in the collections of [[Chuncheon National Museum]] and [[Hallym University]] Museum.  In 637 AD the city was called ''Usooju''. In 757 AD it was renamed ''Saku'' and again in 940 AD as ''Chunju'' ({{Korean|labels=no|춘주|春州}}) before receiving its current name in 1413. In 1896, Chuncheon became the capital city of [[Gangwon (historical)|Gangwon]] province. The city was largely destroyed during the [[Korean War]] in the [[Battle of Chuncheon]].

[[Uiam Dam]] on the Bukhan River was completed in 1967.<ref name="KimKongbogwan1978">{{cite book|author1=Young-kwon Kim|author2=Korea (South). Haeoe Kongbogwan|author3=Soo-jung Lee|title=A Handbook of Korea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8IEJAQAAIAAJ|access-date=10 June 2013|year=1978|publisher=Korean Overseas Information Service, Ministry of Culture and Information|page=576}}</ref> In 1995 Chuncheon city was merged with the government of the surrounding Chuncheon county.

==Culture==
In the spring, the Chuncheon International Mime Festival is held, as well as the Spring Season Art Festival. In the summer, the [[Chuncheon Puppet Festival]] takes place. There is also a [[Makguksu]] festival; a cold noodle dish that originated in Chuncheon. Also celebrated in the summer is the International Animation Festival. The city has had its own annual [[marathon]] race since 1946; the [[Chuncheon Marathon]] is held every October. In winter, snow and ice festivals are organized. Currently, MAC Architects-Consultants Group Ltd. ({{Korean|명승건축그룹|labels=no}}) is building the [[Design and Arts Arcadia of Myungseung]] in Chuncheon.

According to the legend surrounding Cheongpyeongsa temple in Chuncheon-si, a man loved a princess so much that he became a snake and would not leave her alone. When she begged leave to collect rice from the temple, the snake let her go but then went looking for her, only to be struck dead by lightning. The princess then buried him at the temple.<ref>Cin Woo Lee [http://www.cnngo.com/seoul/visit/33-beautiful-temples-enlightenment-857401 "Simply stunning: 33 incredible Korean temples"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417153903/http://www.cnngo.com/seoul/visit/33-beautiful-temples-enlightenment-857401 |date=17 April 2012 }} ''CNN Go''. 10 February 2012. Retrieved 12 April 2012</ref>

==Food==

The city was historically known as a chicken farming region, and is famous for "[[dak galbi]]", which translates as chicken ribs. It consists of chicken, sliced [[cabbage]], [[sweet potato]]es, ''[[tteok]]'' (rice cakes), and [[scallion]]s, mixed with a spicy sauce heavy on [[gochujang]]. It is usually cooked in a big iron pan in the center of the table, but the original method is over charcoal. Despite the name, the dish is traditionally made from leg meat, not ribs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hansik.org/zh/restaurant/recommendRestaurantView.do?fboardId=1077 |title=Hansik.org |access-date=9 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402111658/http://www.hansik.org/zh/restaurant/recommendRestaurantView.do?fboardId=1077 |archive-date=2 April 2012 }}</ref> There is even a street in the city dedicated to restaurants serving the dish, with some 25 restaurants populating the area.<ref>[http://english.tour2korea.com/03Sightseeing/DestinationsByThemes/Depth04.asp?sight=Sightseeing&sightseeing_id=456&ADDRESS_1=15741&ADDRESS_2=14794&ThemeCode=Sightseeing_17&kosm=m3_2 Chuncheon's Dakgalbi (spicy stir-fried chicken with vegetables)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192627/http://english.tour2korea.com/03Sightseeing/DestinationsByThemes/Depth04.asp?sight=Sightseeing&sightseeing_id=456&ADDRESS_1=15741&ADDRESS_2=14794&ThemeCode=Sightseeing_17&kosm=m3_2 |date=27 September 2007 }}, Tour2Korea.com, Retrieved on 14 April 2006</ref>

==Transportation==
[[Image:춘천역.JPG|200px|thumb|[[Chuncheon station]]]]

As of June 2014, there are two train stations in the Chuncheon suburban area: the terminus of the [[Gyeongchun Line]], [[Chuncheon station]], and the busier [[Namchuncheon station]]. [[Gimyujeong station|Gimyujeong]], [[Baegyang-ri station|Baegyang-ri]], [[Gulbongsan station|Gulbongsan]], and [[Gangchon station|Gangchon]] stations, all located in rural Chuncheon, attract tourists. Gangchon is one of the most favorite recreational destinations for university students. The [[Gyeongchun Line]] is a [[double track]] [[rapid transit]] commuter train that connects to [[Yongsan station|Yongsan]], [[Cheongnyangni station|Cheongnyangni]] and [[Sangbong station|Sangbong]] stations in [[Seoul]]. On 21 December 2010, a new realignment of the Gyeongchun Line was opened, and several new or transferable stations have since been opened to replace the existing stations outside Chuncheon, such as [[Cheonmasan station|Cheonmasan]], [[Sinnae station|Sinnae]], and [[Byeollae station|Byeollae]].

There is the Gyeongchun Line subway in Chuncheon. If you use the Gyeongchun Line, you can get to Chuncheon in an hour and a half from Seoul.

Chuncheon is the northern terminus of the [[Korea Expressway Corporation|publicly funded]] [[Jungang Expressway]], and the main destination of the privately run [[Seoul–Yangyang Expressway|Seoul-Chuncheon Expressway]], as also known as Gyeongchun Expressway that connects to [[Seoul]] and [[Hongcheon]]-east.<ref>In contrast of private-owned Seoul-Chuncheon, The current line of Chuncheon Junction to East [[Hongcheon]] interchange is run by [[Korea Expressway Corporation|KEC]], publicly.</ref> As of 2017, the expressway has been extended to east coast city of Yangyang, thus renamed to Seoul-Yangyang Expressway. Chuncheon Bus Terminal connects to all major cities in mainland South Korea.

On [[National highways of South Korea|National roads-wise]], Chuncheon is also the main strategic destination that connects between [[Changwon]] to [[Cheorwon County|Cheolwon]] of Route (Number) 5, [[Incheon]] to [[Goseong County, Gangwon|Goseong]] of [[National Route 46 (South Korea)|46]], and [[Cheorwon County|Cheolwon]] to [[Yangyang]] of 56.

There are also river transport facilities in Soyangho (Lake Soyang), which connects to Cheongpyeongsa (청평사, Buddhist) temple.<ref name="lifeinkorea" />

Chuncheon has a monsoon-influenced [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dwa'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.climate-data.org/asia/south-korea/gangwon-do/chuncheon-4141/?amp=true|title=Chuncheon climate: Average Temperature, weather by month, Chuncheon weather averages|website=En.climate-data.org|access-date=16 December 2021}}</ref> with cold, dry winters and hot, rainy summers.
