==History==
{{Main|Ajuran Sultanate|Silcis|Geledi Sultanate|Italian Somaliland}}

===Medieval Period===
The  [[Silcis|Silcis Dynasty]] were a section of [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran]] that governed the Afgooye district. Neither the Silcis nor the Ajuran developed the town, but limited themselves to controlling the caravan routes and collecting taxes and tribute. The Silcis center of power was in Lama Jiidle (present day Afgooye). Lama Jiidle means "two roads" in Somali.<ref name="Cassanelli 38">{{Cite book|title=The Shaping of Somali Society|last= Cassanelli|first=Lee|year= 1982|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mlhyAAAAMAAJ&q=The+shaping+of+Somali+society
|page= 38|publisher= University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn= 9780812278323}}</ref>

The Silcis imposed taxation on their subject clans, such as the Wacdaan, a fellow subclan of the Gurgate Hawiye, and the Geledi, a Rahanweyn subclan. According to Virginia Luling, "The Sil'is imposed their dominion on the Geledi, who had to pay as tribute a measure (suus) of grain every day from each household; it was collected and loaded on a camel, others say a donkey. A tax was also imposed on those who brought their stock to water at the river”. Barile also describes the taxes levied by the Silcis.<ref>Somali Sultanate: The Geledi City-state Over 150 Years - Virginia Luling (2002) Page 38</ref>

The final ruler of the Silcis in Lama Jiidle (Afgooye) was the sultan 'Umur Abukar Abroone. According to Luling, "His daughter Imbia used to go round collecting the daily tribute of grain, accompanied by her slaves" from her father's Wacdaan and Geledi subjects. Oral accounts hold that one day, "when the Sultan's daughter came round to collect the tribute, she got a beating instead of the grain", as the Geledi refused to pay. When Imbia reported this event to her father, he exclaimed "waa la i afgooye", literally "they have cut off my mouth", meaning that the regime's source of provision had been terminated. Lama Jiidle's name became Afgooye to commemorate this victory over the Silcis.<ref>Somali Sultanate: The Geledi City-state Over 150 Years - Virginia Luling (2002) Page 31</ref>

The Geledi mobilized and under [[Ibrahim Adeer]] a general who used to serve the Ajuran drove the Silcis out of Afgooye and established the [[Geledi Sultanate]].<ref name="Cassanelli2">Lee V. Cassanelli, ''The Shaping of Somali Society: Reconstructing the History of a Pastoral People, 1600-1900'', (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1982), p.271.</ref>

===Early Modern===

Afgooye was in its golden age in the early modern period under the reign of the [[Gobroon dynasty]] which was not only a powerful military machine but, by its use of Asraar or Ta'daar the feared "secret mystical language" was a formidable force in other respects as well. Afgooye at that time was a trading hub center controlling the trade route between the coast and interior. All roads were linked to Afgooye which gave the city immense leverage. During the early 19th century, the city's population was estimated to have exceeded 80,000 making it one of the largest cities in East Africa of that time.<ref name="Dic 28"/> The city was surrounded by a large wall with five fortified gates. It had many complex structures such as multi-story high buildings, big palaces in the center, mosques, residential houses, shops, roads, and bridges. They also built an advanced plumbing system, a drainage system, and a sewage system. The city was very vibrant and developed in its time.<ref>Somali Sultanate: The Geledi City-state Over 150 Years - Virginia Luling (2002) Page 176</ref>

The [[Sultanate of the Geledi|Sultanate]] ruled most of the inter-riverine region and Benadir coast. Its headquarters was located in Afgooye which was an extremely wealthy and large city. Afgooye having some thriving industries such as [[weaving]], [[shoemaking]], [[tableware]], [[jewellery]], [[pottery]] and produced other various products. Afgooye was the crossroads of caravans bringing ivory, leopard skins, and aloe in exchange for foreign fabrics, sugar, dates, and firearms. Afgooyans also traded livestock and slaves. The outside inhabitants of Afgooye grew sorghum, beans, cotton, bananas, and a variety of fruits and vegetables. The Afgooyans say "Laka Beere beerwaye" (you can count on your farm), as opposed to the nomads who counted their camels. Afgooyans raised cows, goats, sheep, and chicken for meat, milk, and ghee. It is said that every household in Afgooye was wealthy and you could not find a single poor person.<ref name="Dic 28"/><ref>{{Cite book|last=Nelson|first=Harold|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQCZwLAsGVYC&q=Somalia%2C+a+Country+Study%7Cchapter-url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fbooks.google.co.uk%2Fbooks%3Fid%3DaQCZwLAsGVYC

Afgooye [[merchants]] boasted their wealth; one of their wealthiest said

<blockquote>''Moordiinle iyo Mereeyey iyo  mooro lidow, maalki jeri keenow kuma moogi malabside''.

''Bring all the wealth of Moordiinle, Mereeyey, and the enclosures of lidow, I scarcely notice it.'' <ref name="Dic 28"/>
</blockquote>

===Italian Somaliland===
At the turn of the 20th century, Afgooye was incorporated into [[Italian Somaliland]]. The Italians occupied the town in 1908 and in the process abolished the local [[Somali slave trade|slave market]].<ref>I.M. Lewis, ''A Modern History of Somalia'', fourth edition (Oxford: Currey, 2002), p. 87</ref> There was also a station in Afgooye on the [[Mogadishu-Villabruzzi Railway]], which connected the town to the capital [[Mogadishu]].
