It is the [[List of most populous cities in Pakistan|44th largest city of Pakistan]] by population. Jhelum is known for providing many soldiers to the British Army before independence,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/pakistan/army.htm |title=Pakistan Army |publisher=Globalsecurity.org website|access-date=24 July 2021}}</ref> and later to the [[Pakistan armed forces]], due to which it is also known as ''City of Soldiers'' or ''Land of [[Martyr]]s and Warriors''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Syed Shoaib Hasan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7024719.stm |title=Rise of Pakistan's 'quiet man' (Ashfaq Parvez Kayani)|publisher=BBC News |date=17 June 2009 |access-date=24 July 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhDX0D-8qjc&feature=player_embedded  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211212/xhDX0D-8qjc| archive-date=2021-12-12 |url-status=live|title=AAJ TV NEWS Report (City of martyrs and warriors) |publisher=Youtube.com |date=10 February 2009 |access-date=24 July 2021}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Jhelum is a few miles upstream from the site of the ancient [[Battle of the Hydaspes]] between the armies of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] and King [[Porus the Elder|Porus]]. Possibly Jhelum City was the capital of Porus' Kingdom, [[Pauravas|Paurava]]. A city called [[Alexandria Bucephalous|Bucephala]]<!-- Should be bold, since Bucephala redirects here --> was founded nearby to commemorate the death of Alexander's horse, [[Bucephalus]]. Other notable sites nearby include the 16th-century [[Rohtas Fort]], the [[Tilla Jogian]] complex of ancient temples, and the 16th-century [[Grand Trunk Road]] which passes through the city. According to the 2023 census of [[Pakistan]], the population of Jhelum was 190,425.<ref name="citypop1"/> The name of the city is derived from the words Jal (pure water) and Ham (snow), as the water that flows through the river originates in the Himalayas. There are a number of industries in and around Jhelum city, including a tobacco factory, wood, marble, glass and flour mills. Its near the capital of Pakistan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tmajhelum.com/industry.html |title=Tehsil Municipal Administration Jhelum – Industries of Jhelum |publisher=Tehsil Municipal Administration Jhelum website |access-date=24 July 2021|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511074658/http://www.tmajhelum.com/industry.html |archive-date=11 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Etymology==
Anjum Sultan Shahbaz recorded some stories of the name ''Jhelum'' in his book Tareekh-e-Jhelum as:<ref>{{cite book|first=Anjum Sultan|last=Shahbaz|title=Tareekh-e-Jhelum|publisher=Book Corner, Main Bazar, Jhelum|url=https://openlibrary.org/b/OL23138105M/Tareekh-e-Jhelum|series=History of Jhelum|date=14 September 2012|edition=2nd|page=92|access-date=24 July 2021}}</ref>

{{cquote|Many writers have different opinions about the name of ''Jhelum''. One suggestion is that in ancient days ''Jhelumabad'' was known as Jalham. The word Jhelum is reportedly derived from the words Jal (pure water) and Ham (snow). The name thus refers to the waters of a river (flowing besides the city) which have their origins in the snow-capped Himalayas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jhelumpolice.gov.pk/aboutjlm.htm |title= The District Jhelum| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415090046/http://www.jhelumpolice.gov.pk/aboutjlm.htm |date=2 March 2008|archive-date=15 April 2009|website=Jhelum Police website|access-date=24 July 2021}}</ref>

However, some writers believe that when "Dara-e-Azam" reached a certain place on the river bank after winning many battles, he fixed his flag at that place and called it "Ja-e-Alam" which means "Place of the Flag". With the passage of time it became ''Jhelum'' from "Ja-e-Alam".

According to tradition, Saeed Bin Abi Waqas, brother of [[Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad Bin Abi Waqas]], was sent to China to preach Islam, during his journey he arrived at the city of ''Jhelum'', he saw the reflection of a city in the river and said "{{lang|ar|هذا جهيلم}}" ''(this is Jhelum)'', which means "City besides the river, in full moonlight".

[[Ahmed Shah Abdali]] also used "Jheelum" in place of ''Jhelum'' and "Harian" for [[Kharian]] in his diary.}}

The [[Gakhars]] appear to represent an early wave of conquerors from the west, who still inhabit a large tract in the mountain north of tilla range. Gakhars were the dominant race during the early Muslim era and they long continued to retain their independence, both in Jhelum itself and in the neighbouring district of [[Rawalpindi]].<ref name="IGI"/>

===Medieval===
In 997 CE, [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi]], took over the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid dynasty]] empire established by his father, [[Sabuktigin|Sultan Sebuktegin]]. In 1005 he conquered the [[Hindu Shahi|Shahi]]s in [[Kabul]] and followed it by the conquests of [[Punjab region]] including Jhelum. The [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later [[Mughal Empire]] ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly [[Muslim]] due to [[missionary]] [[Sufi]] saints whose [[dargah]]s dot the landscape of [[Punjab region]].

The [[Mughals]] were [[Persianate|Persianized]] [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] who claimed descent from both [[Timur]] and [[Genghis Khan]] and strengthened the Persianate culture of Muslim India. Being very few in number, main families of Mughal [[Barlas]], the descent of Ameer-i Taimoor settled in Mong Rasool and afterward scattered to village chak Nazar, Shamaspur, Aima Afghana, khardiyala, Chak sikander, Malhar Muglain, Mota Garbi, [[Bhimber]], they adopted a policy of converting the local [[Jats]] and [[Gakhars]] mandatory as recorded in the [[Baburnama]].<ref name="Biography of Abdur Rahim Khankhana">{{cite web

Canfield, Turko-Persia in historical perspective, Cambridge University Press, 1991. pg 20: "The Mughals – Persianized Turks who invaded from Central Asia and claimed descent from both Timur and Genghis – strengthened the Persianate culture of Muslim India."</ref>

With the collapse of the [[Mughal Empire]] after the death of [[Aurangzeb]], the [[Durrani Empire]] had occupied the plains but were eventually ousted by the [[Sikhs]].

===Later periods===
After the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]], the region fell under [[Durrani Empire|Afghan]] occupation. During the decline of Afghan rule following the [[Third Battle of Panipat]], the newly emerging [[Sikh Empire]] invaded and occupied [[Jhelum District]] in 1808 from its [[Gakhars|Gakhar]] ruler Raja Sultan Muqarrab Khan. In 1849 Jhelum passed with the rest of the [[Sikh]] territories to the [[British Raj|British]]. The [[British Empire|British]] conquered Jhelum in 1849 with the assistance of the local [[Gakhars]] who resented [[Sikh Empire|Sikh]] rule. In 1857 the 14th Native Infantry stationed at Jhelum town mutinied, and displayed a vigorous defence against a force sent from [[Rawalpindi]] to disarm them, but decamped for the night following the action, with the main body being subsequently arrested by the Kashmiri authorities, into whose territory they had escaped. They were then handed over to the British colonial authorities and executed for treason.[[File:A Fort in Jhelum City.jpg|thumb|A [[Sikh Empire|Sikh]]-era fort in Jhelum City]]

===British Raj===
During [[British rule]], Jhelum was connected by the [[North Western Railway (British India)|North-Western Railway]] to other cities in the [[British Raj|Indian Empire]], 1,367 miles from [[Calcutta]], 1,413 from [[Bombay]], and 849 from [[Karachi]]. The population according to the 1901 census of India was 14,951.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V14_165.gif |title=''Imperial Gazetteer of India'', v. 14, p. 159-160 |publisher=Digital South Asia Library website |access-date=24 July 2021}}</ref>

According to the ''[[Imperial Gazetteer of India]]'':

{{cquote|The present town is of modern origin, the old town, which may have been the Bucephala of Alexander having been, on the left or opposite bank of the river. Under [[Sikh empire|Sikh rule]] the place was quite unimportant, being mainly occupied by a settlement of boatmen, and at the time of annexation contained about 500 houses. It was then chosen as the site of a cantonment and as the headquarters of the civil administration. For some years it was the seat of the Commissioner of the Division, but in 1859 his headquarters were transferred to [[Rawalpindi]]. Under British rule, Jhelum has steadily advanced in prosperity; and is the entrepôt for most of the trade of the District, though, since the completion of the Sind-Sāgar branch of the [[North Western Railway (British India)|North-Western Railway]]; the salt trade no longer passes through it. It is an important timber dépôt, the timber from the Kashmir forests which is floated down the river being collected here. A good deal of boat-building is carried on. The cantonment, which is 3 miles from the civil station, contains the church and post office. The normal strength of the garrison is one Native cavalry and four Native infantry regiments. The municipality was founded in 1867. During the ten years ending 1902–3 the receipts averaged Rs. 32,100, and the expenditure Rs, 31,900. Receipts and expenditure from cantonment funds in the same period averaged Rs. 31,900 and Rs. 6,100 respectively. The chief income of the municipality in 1903-4 was Rs. 34,200 chiefly from [[octroi]]; and the expenditure was Rs. 41,000. The town has two Anglo vernacular schools, a municipal high school, and a middle school maintained by the American Presbyterian Mission. Besides the civil hospital, the mission also maintains a hospital.<ref name=autogenerated1/>|}}

[[File:Lectern - Jhelum by Khalid Mahmood.jpg|thumb|upright|Marble [[lectern]] in memory of 35 British soldiers]]

During the [[Mutiny of 1857]], 35 British soldiers of the Regular [[South Wales Borderers|24th Regiment of Foot]] were killed at the [[Battle of Jhelum (1857)|Battle of Jhelum]] by mutineers from the [[East India Company|Honourable East India Companies]] 14th Bengal Native Infantry (roughly 500 of the soldiers mutinied with roughly 100 of the [[Sikh]] soldiers remaining loyal). Among the dead was Captain Francis Spring, the eldest son of [[William Spring (British Army officer)|Colonel William Spring]].<ref>The London Gazette, 19 May 1858 http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/22141/pages/2492/page.pdf</ref> A lectern inside St John's Church Jhelum shows the names of those 35 soldiers. St John's Church is located in the Jhelum Cantonment, [[Pakistan]] beside the river Jhelum. It was built in 1860 and remains a landmark in the city. It was built as a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] church and was in use throughout the [[British Raj|British period]]. For the past forty years, it has been closed to the public and in poor condition, however, it has since{{when|date=May 2012}} been renovated and reopened and is now maintained.

The British soldier [[William Connolly (VC)|William Connolly]] won a [[Victoria Cross]] for his bravery during this battle. Mirza Dildar Baig, also known as Khaki Shah, took part in the [[mutiny]] at Jhelum and was later celebrated by [[Indian nationalist movement|Indian Nationalists]]. He was captured and arrested with the remaining mutineers by authorities in Kashmir and later hanged near the river Jhelum. His grave is in a shrine in Jhelum Dildarnagar, and a small town in Uttar Pradesh is also named after him.

The railway bridge on the river Jhelum was built in 1873 by the British engineer William St. John Galwey. He also made the great Empress Victoria Bridge over the river [[Sutlej]]. During [[World War I]], the [[Jhelum District]] "stood first" among districts in recruiting for the British war effort, with greater financial assistance from the British government channelled into the area in return.<ref name="army">{{cite book|title=The Indian Army and the Making of Punjab|date=2003|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=9788178240596|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O4Wop9vwS9sC&pg=PA114|access-date=10 December 2017|archive-date=19 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819164013/https://books.google.com/books?id=O4Wop9vwS9sC&pg=PA114|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Geography and climate==
Lying at 32°56′ North latitude and 73°44′ East longitude, Jhelum is located a 1-hour and 30 minutes drive from the Capital of Pakistan [[Islamabad]], and 3 hours drive from the heart of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] [[Lahore]]. Jhelum is linked with these cities through the [[National Highways of Pakistan|National Highway]] [[N-5 National Highway|N-5]]. Several cities are within 1 to 2 hours drive including [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]] (home to fan manufacturing),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uog.edu.pk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=194&Itemid=1 |title=University of Gujrat |publisher=University of Gujrat |date=3 March 2012 |access-date=24 July 2021}}</ref> [[Gujranwala]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pak-times.com/2007/05/13/gujranwala-business-center/ |title=Gujranwala Business Center |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111133546/http://www.pak-times.com/2007/05/13/gujranwala-business-center/ |archive-date=11 January 2009|date=13 May 2007|access-date=24 July 2021}}</ref> [[Chakwal]] and [[Mirpur, Azad Kashmir]].

Jhelum has a monsoon-influenced [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cwa'') and is extremely hot and humid in summer, and cold and generally dry in winter. The maximum recorded temperature in the pre-[[monsoon]] season of April to June is {{convert|49.2|C|F}}, whereas in winter the minimum temperature recorded is {{convert|-0.6|C|F|1}}. Average annual rainfall is about {{convert|850|mm|in|0}} which is much below the required quantity given the extremely high evaporation levels. Nevertheless, in the rainy season water torrents flow from the north to the Jhelum River very rapidly and cause damage to the crops, bridges, roads. This is responsible for the soil erosion in the district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=415980&refer=&units=metric|title=Jhelum, Pakistan Travel Weather Averages (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase}}</ref>

Over the years, global climate change has affected Jhelum as well as any other place on Earth and below comparison charts from Weatherbase and NOAA show the difference in rainfall between 1990 and 2015:
