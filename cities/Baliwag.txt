'''Baliwag''', officially the '''City of Baliwag''' ({{IPA|tl|bɐˈliʊag|lang}}; {{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Baliwag}}, [[kapampangan language|Kapampangan]]: ''Lakanbalen ning Baliwag/Siudad ning Baliwag,'' also spelled as ''Baliuag''), is a [[Cities of the Philippines|component city]] in the province of [[Bulacan]], Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 168,470 people.{{PH census|current}}

Baliwag was founded in 1732 by Augustinian friars and was incorporated by the Spanish Governor-General on May 26, 1733. It was carved out from the town of Quingua (now [[Plaridel, Bulacan|Plaridel]]).

Baliwag is {{convert|28|km|sp=us}} from [[Malolos]] and {{convert|51|km|sp=us}} from [[Manila]].

Through the years of Spanish domination, Baliuag was predominantly agricultural. People had to depend on rice farming for the main source of livelihood. Orchards and ''tumanas'' yielded fruits and vegetables, which were sold in the public market. Commerce and industry also played important contributions to the economy of the people. Buntal hat weaving in Baliwag together with silk weaving popularly known in the world as Thai silk; the manufacturer of cigar cases, piña fibers, petates (mats), and Sillas de Bejucos (cane chairs) all of the fine quality became known in many parts of the world. The local market also grew. During the early part of the 19th century, Baliwag was already considered one of the most progressive and richest towns in Bulacan. The growth of the public market has significantly changed the model of the economy of the city.

Baliwag is the major commerce, transportation, entertainment, and educational center of Northern Bulacan. With the continuous expansion of [[Metro Manila]], Baliwag is part of [[Greater Manila Area|Manila's built-up area]] which reaches [[San Ildefonso, Bulacan]] at its northernmost part.

On July 22, 2022, Republic Act No. 11929 lapsed into law. The said measure will convert the municipality into a component city and standardize its name as the City of Baliwag.<ref>{{Cite tweet |author=[[People's Television Network]] |author-link= |user=PTVph |number=1554702039107932163 |date=August 3, 2022 |title="TINGNAN: Listahan ng mga panukalanang nag-lapse into law at vetoed bills, inilabas ng Malacañang. | via Mela Lesmoras" |language=tl |access-date=August 5, 2022 |link=https://twitter.com/PTVph/status/1554702039107932163}}</ref> On December 17, 2022, a plebiscite was held,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cnnphilippines.com/regional/2022/12/2/Comelec-finishes-ballot-printing-for-Baliwag-plebiscite.html | title=Comelec finishes ballot printing for Baliwag plebiscite | access-date=December 15, 2022 | archive-date=December 15, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221215114919/https://www.cnnphilippines.com/regional/2022/12/2/Comelec-finishes-ballot-printing-for-Baliwag-plebiscite.html | url-status=dead }}</ref> 17,814 residents voted in favor of conversion to a component city while only 5,702 voted against.

==Etymology==
The name Baliwag is an old Kapampangan word for "untouched."<ref>[https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2009/05/14/467087/crossing-river-their-itlog-turns-ebun/amp/ Crossing a river, their 'itlog' turns to 'ebun'] on Philstar.com</ref> When it was founded in 1732 by Augustinian friars, the name was hispanized as ''Baliuag''.

==History==
Fr. Joaquín Martínez de Zúñiga, OSA, a friar, in his "1803 Historia de las Islas Filipinas"<ref name="martinezj-1" /> wrote that the Convent or Parochial house of San Agustin, in Baliuag, is the best in the whole Archipelago and that no edifice in Manila can be compared to it in symmetry and beauty amid its towering [[Bell tower|belfry]], having been a viewing point of the town's panorama. The frayle further stated that the Convent was a repository of priceless parish records that dated to the founding of Baliuag as a ''pueblo'' or ''parrochia'' by the OSA or Augustinians in 1733.  But the first convent was erected at Barangay Santa Barbara, Baliuag before the Parokya was formally established at the now Plaza Naning, Poblacion.
[[File:09582jfBaliuag Museum and Library Bulacan Exhibitfvf 04.jpg|thumb|left|200px|"Lumang Municipio" ([[Baliwag Museum and Library]]).]]
Fr. Joaquín Martínez de Zúñiga arrived in the Philippines on August 3, 1786, and visited Baliuag on February 17, 1802, with [[Ignacio Maria de Álava y Sáenz de Navarrete]]. Their host was Baliuag's Parish Priest, Fray Esteban Diez Hidalgo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baliwag.net/index.php/general-information/history-of-baliwag/general-history/129-the-vicariato-of-baliuag-and-early-religious-life?format=pdf |title=www.baliwag.net |access-date=March 30, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012055226/http://www.baliwag.net/index.php/general-information/history-of-baliwag/general-history/129-the-vicariato-of-baliuag-and-early-religious-life?format=pdf |archive-date=October 12, 2013 }}</ref> Fr. Diez served as the longest ''cura parroco'' of Baliuag from 1789, having built the church and convent from 1790 to 1801.

Spanish records "Apuntes históricos de la provincia augustiniana del Santísimo Nombre de Jesús de Filipinas"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3105544|title=Apuntes históricos de la provincia augustiniana del Santísimo Nombre de Jesús de Filipinas : a... - National Library of Australia|work=nla.gov.au|access-date=June 24, 2015}}</ref> reveal that Fr. Juan de Albarran, OSA was assigned Parish Priest of Baliuag in 1733. The first baptism in Baliuag Church was ordered by Fr. Lector and Fr. Feliz Trillo, Provincial of the Province on June 7, 1933, while Baliuag was founded and began its [[de jure]] existence on May 26, 1733. The ''pueblo'' or town was created in the provincial Chapter on May 15, 1734, with the appointment of Fr. Manuel Bazeta/Baseta as first ''cura parroco''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://choosephils.com/read_post.php?cat=travel&id=1890 |title=.:: The majestic Basilica Minore del Santo Niño &#124; Choose Philippines &#124; Travel Articles :: |website=choosephils.com |access-date=January 17, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006175604/http://choosephils.com/read_post.php?cat=travel&id=1890 |archive-date=October 6, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1769–1774, the Church of Baliuag was built by Father Gregorio Giner. The present structure (the third church to be rebuilt, due to considerable damage during the [[1880 Luzon earthquakes]]) was later rebuilt by Father Esteban Diaz using mortar and stone. The 1866 [[Bell tower|Belfry]] was also completed by Father Matias Novoa but the July 19, 1880, quake damaged the same which was later repaired by Father Thomas Gresa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pinoychurches.wordpress.com/2011/05/21/saint-augustine-church-baliuag-bulacan/|title=Protected Blog|work=wordpress.com|date=May 21, 2011 |access-date=June 24, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://simbahan.net/2008/03/10/visita-iglesia-the-old-churches-of-bulacan-part-1-of-2/|title=Visita Iglesia: The old churches of Bulacan, Part 1 of 2|work=Simbahan|access-date=June 24, 2015}}</ref>

The earthquake of June 3, 1863, one of the strongest to ever hit Manila, destroyed the Governor's Palace in [[Intramuros]]. Malacañang then became the permanent residence of the head of the country. The massive quake also damaged the Baliuag Church.<ref>[[Malacañang Palace#Etymology]]</ref>  In 1870, the reconstruction began when a temporary house of worship,  the “Provincial”, along Año 1733 street, emerged as a narrow, and simple edifice which later used by the [[Religious of the Virgin Mary|RVM]] Sisters of the Colegio de la Sagrada Familia (now [[St. Mary's College of Baliuag]]) as the classroom. Antonio de Mesa, “Maestrong Tonio" fabricated the parts to have finished the Spanish-era Baliuag Church.

Baliwag City was the 10th town founded by the Augustinians in the province of Bulacan.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Baliwag City – Provincial Government of Bulacan |url=https://bulacan.gov.ph/cities-and-municipalities/baliwag-city/ |access-date=2023-09-23 |website=bulacan.gov.ph}}</ref>

===First Municipio===
Baliuag had 30 curates (1733–1898): Fr. Esteban Diez Hidalgo and Fr. Fausto Lopez served 40 and 24 years, respectively. Fr. Lopez had 6 children with a beautiful native, Mariquita: Dr. [[Joaquín González (politician)|Joaquin Gonzalez]], Francisco, the former Assemblyman Ricardo Lloret Gonzales ([[Legislative districts of Bulacan]], [[5th Philippine Legislature]]), and Jose the eldest who was widely known as “Pepeng Mariquita", inter alia. Spanish ''cura parroco'', Fr. Ysidoro Prada served in Baliuag during the last decade of the Spaniard regime.

The Philippine-American civil and military authorities supervised the first municipal elections, having chosen Baliuag as the site of the [[1899 Philippine local elections]], the first Philippine elections of May 7, 1899. Francisco Guererro was elected the First Presidente Municipal.<ref>{{cite news | url =http://www.philstar.com/news-feature/397512/baliuag-marks-108-years-town-elections| title = Baliuag marks 108 years of town elections | date = May 7, 2007 |work=The Philippine Star| first =Dino | last =Balabo | access-date = December 31, 2012}}</ref> The Filipinos gathered at the plaza of the St. Augustine Church after the Holy Mass, and thereafter the officials were selected based on the qualifications for voters set by the Americans.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/news-feature/397512/baliuag-marks-108-years-town-elections|title=Baliuag marks 108 years of town elections|work=The Philippine Star|access-date=June 24, 2015}}</ref>

The first town ''Gobernadorcillo'' (1789 title) of Baliuag was Cap. Jose de Guzman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baliwag.net/index.php/general-information/history-of-baliwag/general-history/130-the-gobernadorcillo-in-baliuag?format=pdf |title=Baliwag.net |access-date=January 7, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012034509/http://baliwag.net/index.php/general-information/history-of-baliwag/general-history/130-the-gobernadorcillo-in-baliuag?format=pdf |archive-date=October 12, 2013 }}</ref> He was assisted by the Tribunal's ''teniente mayor'' (chief lieutenant), ''juez de ganadas'' (judge of the cattle), ''juez de sementeras'' (judge of the field) and ''juez de policia'' (judge of the police). In the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)]], the 1893 [[Maura Law]],  the title of ''Gobernadorcillo'' became "capitan municipal" and that of each ''juez'' to ''teniente''. From Baliuag's independence from Quingua, now [[Plaridel, Bulacan]] to 1898, 49 served as ''capitan'', 13 ''alcalde'' and 92 as ''Gobernadorcillo''.  Felix de Lara (1782) and Agustin de Castro (1789) were the 1st ''alcalde'' and ''Gobernadorcillo'', respectively. Municipal President Fernando Enrile, in 1908, honored some of these officials, even naming some of Baliuag ''calles'' in their honor, later. But all these political officials remained under the thumbs and the habito, of the autocratic Augustinian friars, the Baliuag Kura Parokos.

===Don Mariano Ponce===
[[Mariano Ponce]] was a native of Baliuag. He was a founding member of the [[Propaganda Movement]] together with [[José Rizal]] and [[Marcelo del Pilar]]; a former assemblyman of the second district of Bulacan to the [[Philippine Assembly]]; and the co-founder of ''[[La Solidaridad]]'' with fellow co-founder [[Graciano López-Jaena]]. His most common names are Naning (the Plaza Naning in Baliuag being named after his nickname); Kalipulako, named after the [[Cebuano people|Cebuano]] hero [[Lapulapu]]; and Tagibalang or Tigbalang ([[Tikbalang]]), a supernatural being in [[Filipino folklore]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Mariano Ponce |url=https://www.bulacan.gov.ph/generalinfo/hero.php?id=32 |website=Official Website of the Provincial Government of Bulacan |access-date=June 29, 2018 |archive-date=October 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020142622/https://www.bulacan.gov.ph/generalinfo/hero.php?id=32 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===American period===
The local government of Baliuag used as first Municipio under the American regime ([[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)]]) the Mariano Yoyongko (Gobernadorcillo in 1885) Principalia in Poblacion (now a part of the market site), which it bought from Yoyongko.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://junrustia2006.multiply.com/journal/item/2|title=Multiply.com|access-date=June 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304083844/http://junrustia2006.multiply.com/journal/item/2|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On September 15, 1915, Baliuag municipality bought the heritage mansion and a lot of Dr. [[Joaquin Gonzalez (politician)|Joaquin Gonzalez]]. The Gonzalez old mansion served as ''Lumang Municipio'' (the Old Municipio or Town Hall Building, as the seat of the local government) for 65&nbsp;years. It is now the [[Baliuag Museum and Library]].

Baliuag produced not less than 30 priests, including 3 during the Spanish-Dominican, and 2 Jesuits during the American regimes.

Jeorge Allan R. Tengco and Amy R. Tengco (wife of Lito S. Tengco), philanthropists, owners of [[Baliwag Transit]] and other chains of business establishments had been conferred the [[Papal Orders of Chivalry]] October 3, 2000 [[Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice]] and the 2012 Dame of the [[Order of St. Gregory the Great]] awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baliwag.net/index.php/general-information/history-of-baliwag |title=History of Baliuag, Bulacan |access-date=January 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103052010/http://www.baliwag.net/index.php/general-information/history-of-baliwag |archive-date=January 3, 2011 }}</ref>

===Fifth Republic===
On June 16, 1995, communist guerrilla Melencio Salamat Jr., a local leader of the [[New People's Army]] (NPA) in Bulacan, surrendered to the authorities along with 94 other members of the NPA at the Baliwag municipal building. Prior to the surrender, Salamat's group was responsible for collecting "revolutionary taxes" from residents along the coastal towns of Bulacan, and had chosen to give up arms after NPA officials were killed on April 28 in Barangay Catulinan, Baliwag.<ref>{{cite news|last=Reyes|first=Carmela|title=NPA leader, 94 others surrender in Bulacan|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Jq8mAAAAIBAJ&sjid=FAsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4510%2C2314657|access-date=June 20, 2023|work=[[Manila Standard]]|publisher=Standard Publications, Inc.|date=June 17, 1995|page=5}}</ref>
