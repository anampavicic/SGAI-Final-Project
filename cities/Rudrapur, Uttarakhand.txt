'''Rudrapur''' is a city that serves as the headquarters of the [[Udham Singh Nagar district]] in the Indian state of [[Uttarakhand]]. Located at a distance of about {{convert|250|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[New Delhi]] and {{convert|250|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Dehradun]], Rudrapur is located in the fertile [[Terai]] plains in the southern part of [[Kumaon division]] over an area of 27.65&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. With a population of 140,857 according to the [[2011 Census of India|2011 census of India]], it is the [[List of cities in Uttarakhand by population|5th most populous city of Uttarakhand]].

Rudrapur was established in the 16th century by [[Chand kings#List of Chand Kings|King Rudra Chand]] of [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]] to serve as the seat of the governor of the southern [[Tarai]] plains of the kingdom. Since the establishment of the [[State Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand|SIDCUL]] industrial area in its vicinity, the city has undergone rapid development, along with literacy growth and higher employment. Rudrapur is a major industrial and [[List of educational institutions in Rudrapur, Uttarakhand|educational]] hub of the state.

== Civic utilities ==

=== Water Supply ===
Most of the city depends on ground water for its daily water requirement,<ref name=":3" /> where only around 11% of the city has a coverage of water supply network supplying 49 liter per capita per day (lpcd) of water daily.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|title=AMRUT: Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation|url=https://udd.uk.gov.in/pages/display/125-amrut|access-date=2020-09-29|website=udd.uk.gov.in}}</ref> According to a 2019 Sanitation Capacity building platform (SCBP) report, under AMRUT program, the city plans to increase the water supply coverage of the city to approximately 53% with 87 lpcd of daily water capacity<ref name=":3" /> whereas the AMRUT mission site boasts a target mission of 100% water supply coverage and 135 lpcd of water by the end of the mission for its respective target cities.<ref name=":5" />

=== Sewerage and sanitation ===
As per the census 2011, the total percentage of households which had Individual Household Toilets (IHHT) was reported to be around 66.2% of the total number of households in the city. This number according to the AMRUT mission has now been increased to a 100% for the city of Rudrapur <ref name=":5" /> whereas the sewage network coverage in the city according to the 2011 census was 8.4% due to high ground water table and high expenses and technical challenges in laying the system. Most of this system according to the SCBP report is non-functioning and around 68.4% of the households are connected to open drains which lead to the river without any sewage treatment. This has led to over-pollution of the two rivers Kalyani and Begul present within the city.<ref name=":3" />
