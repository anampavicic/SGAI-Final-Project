'''Labo''', officially the '''Municipality of Labo''' ({{lang-tl|Bayan ng Labo}}), is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Camarines Norte]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 109,245 people.{{PH census|current}}

Labo is {{convert|16|km}} from [[Daet]] and {{convert|326|km}} from [[Manila]].

==Geography==
The town of Labo is geographically located relatively at the center of the province of Camarines Norte. It is approximately 335 kilometers south of Manila and 15 kilometers away from Daet, the capital town of the province. It is situated at the coordinates between 14째01'06" and 14째11" North latitudes and 122째21'00" and 122째52'20" East longitudes. On the North, it is bounded by the municipalities of [[Paracale, Camarines Norte|Paracale]], [[Jose Panganiban, Camarines Norte|Jose Panganiban]], and [[Capalonga, Camarines Norte|Capalonga]], on the South, by the province of [[Quezon]], adjoining province of [[Camarines Sur]], on the East by the municipalities of [[Vinzons, Camarines Norte|Vinzons]] and [[San Vicente, Camarines Norte|San Vicente]], and on the West by the municipality of [[Santa Elena, Camarines Norte|Santa Elena]]. The [[Maharlika highway]] links this municipality to provinces and cities of the [[Bicol Region]] and the [[Calabarzon|Calabarzon (Region IV-A)]] region.

Its aggregate land area of 648.84&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> occupies more than 25% of the total land area of the province. Its 52 component barangays represent 18.44% of the total barangays of the province. There are ten (10) classified as urban barangays namely Bagacay, Cabusay, Fundado, Anahaw, Bagong Silang I, Dalas, Gumamela, Kalamunding, Malasugui, Pinya, San Francisco, Talobatib and Tulay na Lupa, and the remaining forty two are considered as rural.

The surface of the municipality is generally rugged, rolling hills and mountainous terrain with relative small rollings and flat terrain. Mt. Cadig (736 meters above sea level), Mt. Labo (1544 meters above sea level), Mt. Bagacay (786 meters above sea level) and Mt. Nalisbitan (265 meters above sea level) form the Southern Cordillera. Boundaries of [[Camarines Norte]], [[Camarines Sur]], and [[Quezon]] provinces converge on Mt. Labo, which is the highest peak in the province. Mt. Bagacay serves as a boundary between municipalities of Paracale and Labo and it as well guards the municipality from strong north winds especially during typhoons. Mt. Labo, Mt. Bagacay, and Mt. Cadig are the three major known dormant volcanoes in the municipality. The north-west portion of the municipality is greatly affected by 2 major fault and earthquake lines accruing in the province, while other trends affect north-north-west along Mt. Cadig passing through the barangays of Guisican and Bayabas. Like its neighbors, Panganiban and Paracale, there is a vast deposit of gold ore in the mountains of Labo, Camarines Norte. It is believed that Mt. Bagacay hides the [[Yamashita's gold|treasures of Gen. Yamashita]] and is the target of both local and foreign treasure hunters and bounty seekers.

===Barangays===
Labo is politically subdivided into 52 [[barangay]]s. Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s and some have [[sitios]].
