'''Monclova''' ({{IPA|es|moŋˈkloβa}}), is a city and the seat of the surrounding [[Monclova (municipality)|municipality of the same name]] in the northern [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Coahuila]]. According to the 2015 census, the city had 231,107 inhabitants.<ref name="inegi.org.mx"/> Its metropolitan area has 381,432 inhabitants and a population density of 29.88 inhabitants per square kilometer.<ref name="inegi.org.mx"/> Monclova is the third-largest city and metropolitan area in the state in terms of population, after [[Torreón]] and [[Saltillo]].

The city accounts for the highest production of steel in Mexico as well as Latin America, hence its nickname "The Steel Capital".

Today Monclova has one of the highest levels of commercial, industrial, and financial development, and is currently has one of the lowest poverty rates among Mexican cities.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}} Its metropolitan area is among the 10 most competitive urban areas in the country, and it also has one of the highest labor productivity rates.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

==History==
Established on July 25, 1577 by Spanish colonists, Monclova became the first city in the region known as Coahuila, which later became the State of Coahuila.

During the [[New Spain|colonial period]] and the early 19th century, Monclova served as the capital of [[Nueva Extremadura]]. It remained the capital for a few years after Mexico's independence. Prior to 1840, haciendas near Monclova were the headquarters of the [[Sánchez Navarro latifundio]], the largest private landholding in the Americas.<ref>Harris, Charles H. (1975), ''A Mexican Family Empire,'' Austin: University of Texas Press, pp. xvii, 182</ref>

During the initial battle for independence from Spain, fleeing rebel leaders who had been captured at the [[Wells of Baján]] were first taken to Monclova before the long trip to the city of [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]]. The captured leaders were [[Juan Aldama]], [[Ignacio Allende]], [[Miguel Hidalgo]], and [[José Mariano Jiménez]].<ref>Fehrenbach, T.R.,(1995, updated). ''Fire and Blood: A History of Mexico,'' New York: Da Capo Press, p.331.</ref>

With the adoption of the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|1824 Constitution]], which created the state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]], the capital was transferred to [[Saltillo]]. In 1828, the decision was overturned when Monclova was declared the capital of the new state, but the state legislature continued to convene in Saltillo. On March 9, 1833, the state legislature settled the dispute in Monclova's favour, and the decision was ratified by President [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] on December 2, 1834.

With the enactment of the [[1835 Constitution of Mexico|1836 Constitutional Laws]], by which the federal republic was converted into a centralised one, the state of Coahuila y Tejas was divided into two departments, Coahuila and Tejas (or Texas, as it would later become). Saltillo was confirmed as Coahuila's capital. However, 1835-36 was also the period of the [[Texas Revolution]], and Texas became an [[Republic of Texas|independent republic]].

==Geography==
Monclova sits at an altitude of 620 m above sea level. It is located at {{Coord|26|54|37|N|101|25|20|W|}}, in the state's central region ''(Región Centro)'', in the east-central part of the state.

=== Climate ===
Monclova experiences a warm [[semi-arid climate]] (BSh), with a median yearly temperature of {{convert|22.0|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.

The median temperature of the coolest month, January, is {{convert|13.6|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, although the temperature can climb as high as {{convert|30|°C|°F|abbr=on}} during some days and it can drop to {{convert|0|°C|°F|abbr=on}} some nights. Probably the coldest snap in recent history took place on December 25, 1983 when the temperature plunged to {{convert|-9.5|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.

On the other hand, temperatures during late spring and summer can have bouts of extreme heat, with evenings above {{convert|40|°C|°F|abbr=on}} for many consecutive days. In recent decades the hottest records have climbed as high as {{convert|43|°C|°F|abbr=on}} on July 13, 2005 and {{convert|45|°C|°F|abbr=on}} on May 4, 1984. However nighttime low temperatures are typically 15 degrees cooler than daytime highs, due to the very arid conditions. Even in July, the warmest month, temperatures have gotten as low as {{convert|10.6|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in 1975. The median temperature July is {{convert|28.6|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. A typical summer day has a low around {{convert|21|°C|°F|abbr=on}} and a high near {{convert|35|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.

In 1976 the wettest month on record took place in July, with {{convert|287.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain, more than half the median yearly value of {{convert|376.7|mm|in|abbr=on}}; however the average wettest month is September with {{convert|78.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} . The warmer months of the year are typically wetter than the cooler ones. Cold fronts in winter have the possibility of drastically reducing temperatures in the area, and are responsible for the little rainfall of such period. Even snowfall has occurred in Monclova some winters, although most years it is a phenomenon reserved only to the nearby mountains. Precipitation occurs an average of 47 days, out of which 6 will be thunderstorms and at least one day with hail.
