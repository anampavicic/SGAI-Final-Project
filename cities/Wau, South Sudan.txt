'''Wau''' ({{langx|ar|واو|''Wāw''}}; also known as '''Wow''', '''Waw''', or '''Wau Town'''){{sfnp|PSI et al.|2014|p=4}} is a town, locally referred to as a city, in northwestern [[South Sudan]] on the western bank of [[Jur River]] (Luo River.) It is the  capital of [[Western Bahr el Ghazal]] region in South Sudan.<ref>[https://radiotamazuj.org/en/article/fighting-wau-red-cross-calls-civilians-be-spared Fighting in Wau; Red cross calls for civilians to be spared] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818213100/https://radiotamazuj.org/en/article/fighting-wau-red-cross-calls-civilians-be-spared |date=18 August 2016 }} Radio Tamazuj</ref> It lies approximately {{convert|650|km|mi}} northwest of the capital, [[Juba]].<ref>{{cite web|author=calculate travel time |url=http://www.travelmath.com/driving-distance/from/Juba,+Sudan/to/WUU |title=Estimated Road Distance Between Juba And Wau |publisher=Travelmath.com |access-date=11 April 2013}}</ref> It is a diverse small urban center (town) and a trading hub.  The city has been a municipality since 2012 and is governed by a mayor who the state governor usually appoints.
The city comprises several neighborhoods including Nazareth, Hai Fahal, Sika Hadid, and Daraja.   

== History ==
Wau was initially established by the [[France|French]] as Fort Desaix<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.smallarmssurveysudan.org/fileadmin/docs/briefing-papers/HSBA-BP-Fertit.pdf|title=IDENTITY AND SELF-DETERMINATION: The Fertit opposition in South Sudan|last=Vuylsteke|first=Sarah|date=December 2018|pages=5, 16}}</ref> and later was established as a ''[[zariba]]'' (fortified base) by [[Slavery in Sudan|slave-traders]] in the 19th century. During the time of [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|condominium rule]], the city became an administrative center.

One of the first insurgent [[Anyanya]] attacks on the [[Sudanese Armed Forces]] (SAF) took place at the Wau barracks in January 1964.

During the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]], Wau remained a SAF [[Garrison|garrison town]]. It was the scene of extensive fighting in the spring of 1998. Battles erupted again in the town in the spring of the 1980s, killing several hundred people. This forced the Dinka in Wau to seek safety on the eastern side of Wau. The Dinka were said to have migrated to the state today known as Warrap.

In 2010, the [[Ministry of Housing, Physical Planning and Environment (South Sudan)|Ministry of Housing, Physical Planning and Environment]] proposed to reshape the city as a giraffe.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/849371--a-city-shaped-like-a-giraffe-southern-sudan-unveils-big-plans A city shaped like a giraffe?] ''Toronto Star'', 18 August 2010, by Maggie Fick, Associated Press</ref>

=== South Sudanese Civil War ===

Following the outbreak of the [[South Sudanese Civil War]], the town has experienced numerous clashes, massacres, and much destruction at the hands of anti-government as well as government forces. In April 2014, [[Nuer people|Nuer]] soldiers belonging to the local [[Sudan People's Liberation Army|SPLA]] garrison mutinied after hearing of a massacre at Mapel. They clashed with SPLA loyalists, and then fled into the rural countryside, joining a [[2014 retreat from Western Bahr el Ghazal|long march of other deserters]] to Sudan.{{sfnp|Small Arms Survey|2014}} About 700 Nuer civilians subsequently sought protection at Wau's [[United Nations Mission in South Sudan|UNMISS base]]; most of them were family members of the deserted soldiers, while others were students.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://radiotamazuj.org/en/news/article/unmiss-denies-that-refuge-seekers-in-wau-were-turned-away |title=UNMISS denies that refuge-seekers in Wau were turned away |work=Radio Tamazuj |date=16 May 2014 |access-date=11 August 2018}}</ref>
