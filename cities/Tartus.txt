'''Tartus''' ({{langx|ar|طَرْطُوس}} / [[ALA-LC]]: ''Ṭarṭūs''; known in the [[County of Tripoli]] as '''Tortosa''' and also transliterated from [[French language|French]] '''Tartous''') is a major port city on the Mediterranean coast of [[Syria]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tartus in the Present Crisis: A Mirror of the Syrian Regime |url=https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2014/04/tartus-in-the-present-crisis-a-mirror-of-the-syrian-regime?lang=en&center=middle-east |access-date=2024-06-24 |website=carnegieendowment.org |language=en}}</ref> It is the second largest port city in Syria (after [[Latakia]]), and the largest city in [[Tartus Governorate]].<ref>{{citation |url=https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Syria%20governorate%20profiles%206%20August%202014.pdf|publisher= UNOCHA |title= Syrian Arab Republic – Governorates profile|date=June 2014|access-date= 20 March 2020}}</ref> Until the 1970s, Tartus was under the governance of [[Latakia Governorate]], then it became a separate governorate.<ref name="Statoids">{{cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/usy.html|title=Syria Provinces|website=www.statoids.com}}</ref> The population is 458,327 (2023 estimate).<ref>{{cite web |title=world population review |url=https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/tartus-population |website=Tartus Population |publisher=world population review}}</ref> In the summer it is a vacation spot for many Syrians.

==Etymology==
The name derives from Ancient {{langx|el|Αντιαράδος|Anti-Arados}} (Antarados or ''Anti-Aradus'', meaning "The town facing Arwad"). In [[Latin]], its name became ''Tortosa''. The original name survives in its [[Arabic language|Arabic]] form as ''Ṭarṭūs'' ({{langx|ar|طَرْطُوس}}), from which the [[French language|French]] ''Tartous'' and [[English language|English]] ''Tartus'' derive.

The History of Tartus goes back to the 2nd millennium BCE when it was founded as a [[Phoenicia]]n [[colony]] of [[Arwad|Aradus]].<ref name="est.">[http://lexicorient.com/e.o/tartus.htm Tartus] Encyclopaedia of the Orient.

=== Greco-Roman and Byzantine era ===
[[File:Tartus, campanella d'oro lavorata a traforo, 390 dc ca.JPG|Greek gold fretworked bell, {{Circa|390 AD}}|150px|thumb]] 
[[File:Siria, tartous, maschera funebre, I sec ac.-IV dc ca..JPG|Funeral mask, 1st century BC-4th AD|thumb|150px]]

The city was called Antaradus in [[Latin]]. [[Athanasius]] reports that, under [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine the Great]], Cymatius, the Orthodox bishop of Antaradus and also of [[Arwad|Aradus]] (whose names indicate that they were neighbouring towns facing each other) was driven out by the [[Arianism|Arians]]. At the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381, Mocimus appears as bishop of Aradus. At the time of the [[Council of Ephesus]] (431), some sources speak of a Musaeus as bishop of Aradus and Antaradus, while others mention only Aradus or only Antaradus. Alexander was at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451 as bishop of Antaradus, Paulus as bishop of Aradus, while, at a synod held at Antioch shortly before, Paulus took part as bishop of both Aradus and Antaradus. In 458, Atticus signed, as bishop of Aradus, the letter of the bishops of the province of Phoenicia Prima to Byzantine Emperor [[Leo I the Thracian]] protesting about the murder of [[Proterius of Alexandria]]. Theodorus or Theodosius, who died in 518, is mentioned as bishop of Antaradus in a letter from the bishops of the province regarding [[Severus of Antioch]] that was read at a synod held by [[Patriarch Mennas of Constantinople]]. The acts of the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] in 553 were signed by Asyncretius as bishop of Aradus. At the time of the Crusades, Antaradus, by then called Tartus or Tortosa, was a [[Latin Church]] diocese, whose bishop also held the titles of Aradus and [[Maraclea]] (perhaps [[Rakhlah|Rachlea]]). It was united to the see of Famagosta in Cyprus in 1295.<ref>Pius Bonifacius Gams, [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=65154&dirids=1 ''Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae''], Leipzig 1931, p.&nbsp;434</ref><ref>Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 827-830</ref><ref>Konrad Eubel, ''Hierarchia Catholica Medii Aevi'', [http://sul-derivatives.stanford.edu/derivative?CSNID=00002716&mediaType=application/pdf vol. 1], p.&nbsp;92; [http://sul-derivatives.stanford.edu/derivative?CSNID=00002717&mediaType=application/pdf vol. 2], p.&nbsp;XII and 89</ref>

No longer a residential bishopric, Antaradus is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 833</ref>

The city was favored by Constantine for its devotion to the cult of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]. The first chapel to be dedicated to the Virgin was built here in the 3rd century.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Tartus | title=Ṭarṭūs &#124; Syria &#124; Britannica }}</ref>

=== Early Islamic era ===
Islamic rule was established in Syria in 634. In the years before, Arab merchants would spread the word of Islam and locals embraced the new religion while others continued to practice their respective faiths. During the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest of the Levant]], caliphate armies conquered Tartus under the leadership of [[Ubadah ibn al-Samit]] in 636.<ref name="kitAb futuh al-buldAn; Baladhuri">{{cite web |last1=K.

=== Crusades ===
[[File:Notre dame de tortosa.jpg|thumb|right|The Crusader-era [[cathedral of Our Lady of Tortosa]].]]
The Crusaders called the city Antartus, and also Tortosa. It was captured in 1099 during the [[First Crusade]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Boas|first=Adrian|title=Crusader Archaeology|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=978-0-415-17361-2|pages=255}}</ref> [[Franks|Frankish]] forces captured Tortosa in 1099. Once the land was seized, the cathedral was built over the spot of a Byzantine church.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Boas|first=Adrian|title=Crusader Archaeology|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=978-0-415-17361-2|pages=7}}</ref> but it was later taken over by Muslims, before it was recaptured by [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse|Raymond of Saint-Gilles]] in February 1102 after two weeks of siege, then it was left in 1105 to his son [[Alfonso Jordan]] and was known as Tortosa.<ref>{{Cite EB1911||first=Ernest|last=Barker|wstitle=Raymund of Toulouse|volume=22|pages=934-935}}</ref> In 1123 the Crusaders built the semi-fortified [[Cathedral of Our Lady of Tortosa]] over a Byzantine church that was popular with pilgrims.

[[File:Tartus fortress chapel 0790.jpg|thumb|200px|Templar Chapel, [[Citadel of Tartus]]]]

In 1152, Tortosa was handed to the [[Knights Templar]], who used it as a military headquarters. They engaged in some major building projects, constructing a [[Citadel of Tartus|castle]] around 1165 with a large chapel and an elaborate keep, surrounded by thick double concentric walls.<ref>''Lost Worlds: Knights Templar''. [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] video documentary, first aired July 10, 2006.</ref> The Templars' mission was to protect the city and surrounding lands, some of which had been occupied by Christian settlers, from Muslim attack. [[Nur ad-Din Zangi]] captured Tartus from the Crusaders for a brief time before he lost it again.<ref name="Barber">{{cite book|last=Barber|first=M.|title=The Crusader States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bz_O7-Lb_CsC&pg=PA256|year=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-18931-5|page=256}}</ref>

The city of Tortosa was recaptured by [[Saladin]] in 1188, and the main Templar headquarters was relocated to [[Cyprus]]. However, in Tortosa, some Templars were able to retreat into the keep, which they continued to use as a base for the next 100 years. They steadily added to its fortifications until it also fell, in 1291. Tortosa was the last outpost of the Templars on the Syrian mainland, after which they retreated to a garrison on the nearby island of [[Arwad]], which they held for another decade.<ref name="crusade-en">{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2006 |title=Acre, Siege of (1291) |encyclopedia=The Crusades: An Encyclopedia |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |location=[[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6cSXSgAACAAJ |last=Burgtorf |first=Jochen |editor-last=Alan V.

===Ottoman era===
[[File:Citadel_of_Tartus,_plan_1871.jpg|thumb|[[Citadel of Tartus]] layout as of 1871]]

During the [[Ottoman Syria|Ottoman rule]], the city gained importance mainly due to trade with Cyprus and Europe. At the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries, it became one of the coastal defense points due to its strategic port. In 1832, at the beginning of the [[Egyptian–Ottoman War (1831–1833)|First Egyptian-Ottoman War]], the city and its surroundings were conquered by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]], then ruler of Egypt.<ref>Trevor N.

In 1839, the [[Ottoman Empire]] decided to reconquer its Syrian coastal territories from Egypt with the support of Great Britain. In 1840, during the [[Egyptian–Ottoman War (1839–1841)|Syrian War]], British frigates [[His Majesty's Ship|HMS]] {{HMS|Carysfort|1836|2}}, [[His Majesty's Ship|HMS]] {{HMS|Benbow|1813|2}} and {{HMS|Zebra|1815|6}}, with the help of a landing force of marines, attacked the citadel in Tartus.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Charles John Napier]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WFsLAAAAIAAJ|title=The war in Syria|publisher=John W.

===Modern era===
[[File:hamrat.jpg|thumb|Hamrat street, Tartus (1970)]]

On May 23, 2016, the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] claimed responsibility for three [[suicide bombing]]s at a bus station in Tartus, which had remained largely unaffected since the [[Syrian Civil War]] began in 2011 and continues to remain that way, as a stronghold of the [[Government of Syria]]. Purportedly targeting Alawite gatherings, the bombs killed 48 people. In [[Jableh]], similarly insulated, another four bombers killed over a hundred people.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/is-blasts-in-syria-regime/2810604.html |title=IS blasts in Syria regime heartland kill more than 148 |author=AFP |work=[[Channel NewsAsia]] |date=24 May 2016|access-date=20 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523190938/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/is-blasts-in-syria-regime/2810604.html |archive-date=23 May 2016}}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:حمام قنية حارة القلعة وبيت شعبان 14-6-2013.jpg|thumb|220px|Mediterranean shrubs and meadows around Tartus]]
The city lies on the eastern coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] bordered by the [[Syrian Coastal Mountain Range]] to the east. [[Arwad]], the only inhabited island on the Syrian coast, is located a few kilometers off the shore of Tartus. Tartus occupies most of the coastal plain, surrounded to the east by mountains composed mainly of [[limestone]] and, in certain places around the town of [[Souda]], [[basalt]].
===Climate===

Tartus has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] (''[[hot-summer mediterranean climate|Csa]]'') with mild, wet winters, hot and humid summers, and short transition periods in April and October. The hills to the east of the city create a cooler climate with even higher rainfall. Tartus is known for its relatively mild weather and high precipitation compared to inland Syria.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbssyr.org |title=Central Bureau of Statistics |publisher=Cbssyr.org |access-date=August 4, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428121127/http://www.cbssyr.org/ |archive-date=April 28, 2007 }}</ref>
