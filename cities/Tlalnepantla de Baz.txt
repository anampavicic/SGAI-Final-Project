'''Tlalnepantla de Baz''' ([[Otomi language|Otomi]]: {{Lang|ote|Ndemhāi}}){{cn|date=December 2023}} is one of 125 [[Municipalities of Mexico|municipalities]] of the [[state of Mexico]], north of [[Greater Mexico City|Mexico City]]. The municipal seat and largest city in the municipality is the city of '''Tlalnepantla'''.  ''Tlalnepantla'' comes from the Náhuatl words ''tlalli'' (land) and ''nepantla'' (middle) to mean the middle land. The city was known in prior times as Tlalnepantla de Galeana and Tlalnepantla de Comonfort, to honor [[Hermenegildo Galeana (general)|Hermenegildo Galeana]] and [[Ignacio Comonfort]], respectively.  The current addition of ''Baz'' comes from the last name of [[Gustavo Baz Prada]], an important politician and soldier of [[Emiliano Zapata]]'s army during the [[Mexican Revolution]]. After the Revolution, Baz Prada became Governor of the State of Mexico and President of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). It is located in the northeastern part of the state of Mexico, in the Valley of Mexico north of Mexico City proper.<ref name="EncMuc">{{Cite web |title=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de Mexico Estado de Mexico Tlalnepantla |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/mexico/mpios/15104a.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204157/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/mexico/mpios/15104a.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=2007-09-27 |access-date=2008-03-26}}</ref> Tlalnepantla de Baz has an [[exclave]] to the west, divided by [[Gustavo A. Madero, Mexico City|Gustavo A. Madero]]. Together with [[Atizapán]], it comprises the dense [[Region XII (Mexico State)|Region XII]] of Mexico State.

==History==
[[File:Palacio de gobierno de tlalnpantla.JPG|thumb|Tlalnepantla's municipal building]]
Around the 11th century, a people called the Amaquemecan (after whom the municipality of [[Amecameca]] is named), migrated to this area following their leader [[Xolotl]] to look for a better climate and more food to sustain themselves. This same Xolotl founded the Tenayuca Oztopolco chiefdom and made the first census ever in the Americas.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} The [[Acolhua]]s, [[Tepaneca]]s and [[Otomi people|Otomi]]s were already established in this land so alliances were made. Despite this, the region was eventually conquered and made a tributary of the [[Aztec Empire]]. After the Spanish Conquest, the area was evangelized by the [[Franciscans]].  The founding of modern Tlalnepantla was the result of a dispute between the towns of Tenayuca and [[Teocalhueyacan]] as to which should be the site of Franciscan monastery and religious center for the area. The result was to place the monastery at the midpoint between these two towns, and hence the name (middle land). This monastery, named Corpus Christi was built in 1550. After independence, Tlalnepantla was originally part of Mexico City, but in 1825, it was recognized as a district of the State of Mexico. The municipality is divided almost entirely by Mexico City's [[Gustavo A. Madero, Mexico City|Gustavo A. Madero]] delegation. During the presidency of [[Porfirio Díaz]], Tlalnepantla began industrial development, and in the 1950s underwent a demographic explosion after being declared a city in 1948.<ref name="EncMuc"/> The population as of the 2010 [[INEGI]] census was 653,410 people, representing 98.37% of municipal population.<ref name="2010 census tables: INEGI">[http://mapserver.inegi.org.mx/mgn2k/?s=geo&c=1223 2010 census tables: INEGI] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502025339/http://mapserver.inegi.org.mx/mgn2k/?s=geo&c=1223 |date=2013-05-02 }}</ref>

On January 16, 1977, Tlalnepantla del Baz was the site of one of the worst railway disasters in Mexico's history when a bus driver attempted to cross a railroad ahead of an oncoming train. The driver was one of 42 people killed.<ref>"42 Die as Mexican Bus Loses Race With Train", ''Los Angeles Times'', January 18, 1977, p.I-4</ref>

The [[Tlalnepantla Cathedral|church and monastery of Corpus Christi]] was built by both [[Nahua people|Nahuas]] and Otomis of pink and gray stone. The side gate, called the Porciúncula, shows the influence of both these peoples. In 1963, the church gained cathedral status.

[[File:Pyramid of Santa Cecilia.jpg|thumb|Pyramid at Santa Cecilia Acatitlán]]
Two notable pyramids lie in the municipality's limits: [[Tenayuca]] and [[Santa Cecilia Acatitlan]]. The pyramid at Tenayuca is a smaller version of the [[Templo Mayor]] the [[Aztec]]s built in [[Tenochtitlan]]. It has dual staircases on the west side, each leading to two temples, at the top of the pyramid. One was dedicated to [[Tlaloc]] and the other to [[Huizilopochtli]]. Serpent sculptures surround the pyramid on three sides and are possibly of pre-Aztec origin.<ref name="lonely">{{Cite book |last=Noble |first=John |title=Lonely Planet Mexico City |publisher=Lonely Planet Publications |year=2000 |isbn=1-86450-087-5 |location=Oakland, California |page=131}}</ref> A small museum on the grounds holds artifacts, diagrams, and models of the site and the history that surrounds it. Another smaller pyramid is at Santa Cecilia Acatitlan, just north of Tenayuca. This one was rebuilt as the original was destroyed and some of its blocks were used to build the Santa Cecelia Parish church that is next to it. This pyramid has one staircase, one temple atop. On the plaza is the Hurtado Museum, which houses a small collection of pre-Hispanic sculpture.<ref name="lonely" />
