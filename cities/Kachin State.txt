'''Kachin State''' ({{langx|my|ကချင်ပြည်နယ်}}; [[Jingpho language|Kachin]]: {{lang|kac|Jinghpaw Mungdaw}}) is the northernmost [[administrative divisions of Myanmar|state]] of [[Myanmar]]. It is bordered by China to the north and east ([[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] and [[Yunnan]], respectively), [[Shan State]] to the south, and [[Sagaing Region]] and [[India]] ([[Arunachal Pradesh]]) to the west. It lies between north latitude 23° 27' and 28° 25' longitude 96° 0' and 98° 44'. The area of Kachin State is {{convert|89041|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The capital of the state is [[Myitkyina]]. Other important towns include [[Bhamo]], [[Mohnyin]] and [[Putao Town, Kachin State|Putao]].

Kachin State has Myanmar's highest mountain, [[Hkakabo Razi]] at {{convert|5889|m|ft}}, forming the southern tip of the [[Himalayas]], and a large inland lake, [[Indawgyi Lake]].

[[File:China 1911 en.svg|thumb|300px|The Qing dynasty in 1911]]
The Qing dynasty of China briefly controlled the present Kachin state  during the 1760 [[Sino-Burmese War (1765–1769)|Sino-Burmese War]].

What is now Kachin State was historically inhabited by a diverse population of various ethnolinguistic groups, including the [[Nung Rawang|Rawang]], the [[Lisu people|Lisu]], the [[Jingpo people|Jingpo]], the [[Zaiwa language|Zaiwa]], the [[Lachik|Lashi/Lachik]] and the Lawngwaw/Maru, all of whom had overlapping territories and varying social structures.<ref>Sadan, M. 2007, TRANSLATING GUMLAU:HISTORY, THE ‘KACHIN’ AND EDMUND LEACH. in Sadan, M and Robinne, F. (eds) 2007. Social Dynamics in the Highlands of Southeast Asia, Reconsidering Political Systems of Highland Burma by E. R. Leach. Brill. Leiden, Boston.</ref><ref>Kachin National Museum, Myitkyina</ref> The term "Kachin" is a term given by the British during the colony period referring to ethnic groups living between the central Bamar heartland to the south and China to the north.

Traditional [[Kachin people|Kachin]] society was based on shifting hill agriculture. According to "The Political Systems of Highland Burma: A Study of Kachin Social Structure", written by E. R. Leach, Kachin was not a linguistic category. Political authority was based on chieftains who depended on support from immediate kinsmen. Considerable attention has been given by anthropologists of the Kachin custom of maternal cousin marriage, wherein it is permissible for a man to marry his mother's brother's daughter, but not with the father's sister's daughter. In pre-colonial times, the Kachin were [[Animism|animist]].

After the 1760s [[Sino-Burmese War (1765–1769)|Qing-Konbaung war]], the Chinese exercised a degree of control over the present-day northeastern Kachin State. During the British colonization of Burma, the [[Kachin Hills]] tribal autonomy was accepted by the British government. British forces carried out two expeditions against the Kachin in 1892 and 1896. In 1910, the British occupied Hpimaw (Pianma) in the ''[[Pianma Incident]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Yunnan|title=Yunnan &#124; province, China|website=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|quote=In 1910 the British, then established in Burma, induced the ''[[tusi]]'' of Pianma (Hpimau) to defect from the central [[Qing Empire|Chinese government]], and they then occupied his territory in northwestern Yunnan. Britain also forced [[Republic of China (1912)|China]] to give up a tract of territory in what is now the Kachin state of Myanmar (1926–27), as well as the territory in the Wa states (1940).|access-date=2023-10-30}}</ref>

The pre-independence Burmese government under [[Aung San]] reached the [[Panglong Agreement]] with the Shan, Kachin, and Chin peoples on 12 February 1947. The agreement accepted "Full autonomy in internal administration for the Frontier Areas" in principle and envisioned the creation of a Kachin State by the Constituent Assembly. Burma attained independence on 4 January 1948. Kachin State was formed in the same year out of the former [[British rule in Burma|British Burma]] civil districts of [[Bhamo District|Bhamo]] and [[Myitkyina District|Myitkyina]], together with the larger northern district of [[Putao District|Puta-o]]. Kachin State was officially announced on 10 January 1948 and Kachin State Government held "Mungdaw Masat Masat Manau" (forming of Kachin State Manau) for three consecutive days since 9 to 11 January as happiness since that year they held Manau on 10 January every year until the [[1962 Burmese coup d'état]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Jinghpaw Mung Hte Ngai|last=Wabaw|first=Zau Rip|year=1983|location=Myitkyina|pages=112}}</ref> The vast mountainous hinterlands are predominantly [[Jingpo people|Kachin]], whereas the more densely populated railway corridor and southern valleys are mostly [[Shan people|Shan]] and [[Bamar]]. The northern frontier was not demarcated and [[China–Myanmar border#1960 border treaty|until the 1960s]]. Various Chinese governments had claimed the [[Jiangxinpo|northern-half]] of Kachin State as Chinese territory since the 18th century.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Before the British rule, roughly 75% of all Kachin [[jadeite]] ended up in China, where it was prized much more highly than the local Chinese [[nephrite]].

Kachin troops formerly formed a significant part of the Burmese army. With the unilateral [[wikt:abrogate|abrogation]] of the [[Union of Burma]] constitution by the [[Ne Win]] regime in 1962, Kachin forces withdrew and formed the [[Kachin Independent Army|Kachin Independence Army]] (KIA) under the [[Kachin Independence Organization]] (KIO). Aside from the major towns and railway corridor, Kachin State has been virtually independent from the mid-1960s through 1994, with an economy based on agriculture and trade with China, including of jade. After a Myanmar army offensive in 1994 seized the jade mines from the KIO, a peace treaty was signed, permitting continued KIO effective control of most of the State, under aegis of the Myanmar military. This ceasefire immediately resulted in the creation of numerous splinter factions from the KIO and KIA of groups opposed to the [[State Peace and Development Council|SPDC]]'s controversial peace accord, and the political landscape remains highly unstable.

===Kachin conflict===
{{main|Kachin conflict}}

The complex political situation started when the Kachin armed group was established on 25 October 1960, after the U Nu government announced the state religion as Buddhism, as the Kachin people stopped believing in the government administration system, established after the federal union was agreed upon in the 1947 Panglong agreement. Between 1962 and 2010, the military government ruled over Myanmar. Cease fire agreements between ethnic armed groups and the government were made starting in 1989. And then in 2011 the new government led by President Thein Sein, broke the cease fire agreement which was agreed upon by the former military government and the Kachin ethnic armed group in 1994, resuming fighting against the Kachin who are living in the northern part of Myanmar, northern part of Shan, near the China border on 9 June 2011. Because of the abrupt internal conflict, thousands of internally displaced people fled to refugee camps which are located in the government-controlled area as well in the Kachin Independence Army controlled area (Hlaing, 2005).

KIO made a [[ceasefire]] agreement with the [[State Peace and Development Council|military government]] in 1994 while leaving political issues to be discussed with the next elected government.  Throughout its struggle, both in the ceasefire and non-ceasefire period, KIO also made agreements with other ethnic rebels and alliances including the Democratic Alliance of Burma (DAB), the National Democratic Front (NDF), and United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC). The main goal was to pressure the military government and restore the federal democratic government with greater autonomy to Kachin State. During its 17 years of ceasefire from 1994 to 2011 the KIO actively participated in the military-led constitution-drafting-process, attending the National Convention, which was boycotted by the democratic icon Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy and ethnic political parties. The KIO together with 12 other ethnic groups demanded amendments of the draft to be more in line with a federal democratic system and to give autonomy to states (Zaw Oo & Win Min 2007).

The seventeen-year ceasefire broke down and fighting between the Kachin Independence Organization and the government resumed in June 2011 after the Kachin Independent Army disallowed the government's order to transform into a Border Guard Force and it claimed that the regime's 2008 Constitution lacked federal democratic principles and equal political rights for ethnic minorities based on the Panglong Agreement. Renewed fighting between the [[Kachin Independence Army]] and the [[Burmese army]] began on 9 June 2011 at [[Ta-pein hydropower plan]] and continued throughout 2012. Initial reports suggested that from June to September 2011 a total of 5,580 [[Internally Displaced Persons]] from 1,397 households arrived at 38 IDP camps under Myanmar Government control.<ref>{{Citation | title = UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Kachin fighting hits IDP health | place= Myitkyina | date = 15 November 2012 | newspaper = Irin | url = http://www.irinnews.org/Report/96785/MYANMAR-Kachin-fighting-hits-IDP-health}}.</ref> In August 2012 thousands of Kachin refugees were forced by the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Government]] back into [[Myanmar]] despite the continued fighting there; NGOs like [[Human Rights Watch]] called to cease such action and pointed the illegality of doing so under international law.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = BBC | date = 24 August 2012 | title = China 'forcing Kachin refugees back to Burma | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19365075}}.</ref> As of 9 October 2012, over 100,000 IDPs are taking shelter in various camps across Kachin State. The majority of IDPs (est. 70,000) are currently sheltering in KIA controlled territory.<ref>{{Citation |title=IDPs |publisher = MRTV3 | url = http://www.mrtv3.net.mm/newpaper/411newsn.pdf | page = 8 Col 4}}. {{dead link|date=November 2016}}</ref> Fatality estimates were difficult to estimate but most reports suggested that between government troops, [[Kachin Independence Army]] rebels, and civilians upwards of 1,000 people had died in the conflict.

Even though many Kachins were already displaced internally, only around 150,000 people are reported as IDPs. The Kachins are currently the major target for the [[Government of Myanmar|Burmese government]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} yet relatively few Kachins have chosen to resettle in countries such as the United States or Australia, in comparison to other Myanmar ethnic minorities, such as the Karens and Chins.

===Language===
[[Burmese language|Burmese]] and [[Jingpho language|Jingpho]] are [[lingua franca]]s of Kachin State. Since Burma achieved independence in 1948, significant numbers of Burmese speakers have settled in Kachin State, which has accelerated a [[language shift]] from Jingpho to Burmese. Other Kachin tribes speak and write their own language: the [[Zaiwa]], the [[Nung Rawang|Rawang]], and the [[Lisu people|Lisu]], who speak both the [[Lisu language]] and the [[Lipo language]]. [[English language|English]] is also widely spoken as a working language.

===Ethnicity===
The ethnic data from the 2014 census is available only with the [[Tatmadaw]] (Myanmar Armed Forces) and not released to the public. As per the 1983 Census, the ethnic composition was Bamar: 29.3%, Shan: 24.2% and Kachin: 38.1%. In a speech delivered on 2016, Min Aung Hlaing of Tatmadaw gave the ethnic composition of the Kachin state as follows: Bamar – 29.2%, Shan – 23.6%, Jingphaw – 18.97%, Lisu – 7%, Rawam – 5%, Lawwaw – 3.33%, Lacheik – 2.89%, Zaikwa – 1.57% and Others – 8%.<ref>https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Ethnic-Identity-in-Myanmar.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref>

==Economy==

===Jade mining===
Over 600 tons of jade stones, which were unearthed from Lone-Khin area in [[Hpakant Township]] in Kachin State, had been displayed in Myanmar Naypyidaw to be sold in November 2011. Most of the jade stones extracted in Myanmar, 25,795 tons in 2009–10 and 32,921 tons in 2008–09, are from Kachin State. The largest jade stone in the world, 3000 tons, 21 metres long, 4.8 metres wide and 10.5 metres high was found in Hpakant in 2000.<ref>{{Citation|publisher=Baganland |date=October 2010 |url=http://www.baganland.net/2010/10/myanmar-jade-production-up.html |title=Burma jade production up |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519122746/http://www.baganland.net/2010/10/myanmar-jade-production-up.html |archive-date=19 May 2011 }}</ref> The Myanmar government pays little attention to the deterioration of environment in Kachin because of jade mining.

As China has shut down domestic mines due to the severe environmental impact, it has largely outsourced rare earth mining to Kachin State.<ref name=":1" /> Chinese companies and miners illegally set up operations in Kachin State without government permits, and instead circumvent the central government by working with a [[Border Guard Forces|Border Guard Force]] militia  under the [[Tatmadaw]], formerly known as the [[New Democratic Army – Kachin]], which has profited from this extractive industry.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web |last=Makichuk |first=Dave |date=2021-05-03 |title=Is Myanmar's junta benefiting from rare-earth boom? |url=https://asiatimes.com/2021/05/is-myanmars-junta-benefitting-from-rare-earth-boom/ |access-date=2023-03-27 |website=Asia Times |language=en-US}}</ref> Mining operations also began in areas controlled by the [[Kachin Independence Organisation]] in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-03-24 |title=Rare-Earth Mining companies defy angry villagers and public opposition |url=https://www.bnionline.net/en/news/rare-earth-mining-companies-defy-angry-villagers-and-public-opposition |access-date=2023-03-27 |website=Burma News International |language=en}}</ref>

Rare earth mining has contaminated and polluted the local environment, including waterways and forests, and eroded mountainous landscapes, and impacted the health of locals.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0" /> Since the [[2021 Myanmar coup d'état]], mining of rare earths in Kachin State has accelerated, due to lack of proper oversight.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-06-14 |title=Rare Earths in Myanmar: Unobtanium? |url=https://thediplomat.com/2021/06/rare-earths-in-myanmar-unobtanium/ |access-date=2023-03-27 |website=The Diplomat |language=en-US}}</ref> Land has also been seized from locals to conduct mining operations.<ref name=":1" /> {{As of|2022|March}}, 2,700 mining collection pools scattered across 300 separate locations were found in Kachin State, encompassing the area of [[Singapore]], and an exponential increase from 2016.<ref name=":1" />

==Transportation==
Kachin State is served by the following airports:
*[[Bhamo Airport]]
*[[Myitkyina Airport]]
*[[Putao Airport]]
There is a railroad between Myitkyina and Mandalay (through Sagaing). The train takes 21–30 hours from Mandalay to Myitkyina.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asterism.info/states/14/|title=Kachin state, northern Myanmar, Burma, travel info & maps|website=Asterism.info|access-date=23 May 2012}}</ref>

==Education==

{{see also|List of universities in Kachin State}}
Educational opportunities in Myanmar are extremely limited outside the main cities of [[Yangon]] and [[Mandalay]]. It is especially a problem in Kachin State where over 60 years of fighting between the government and insurgents has displaced thousands of people. The following is a summary of the education system in the state.<ref name=cso-edu>{{cite web|url=http://www.etrademyanmar.com/STATS/s1701.htm |title=Education statistics by level and by State and Division |access-date=9 April 2009 |publisher=Myanmar Central Statistical Organization |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524012235/http://www.etrademyanmar.com/STATS/s1701.htm |archive-date=24 May 2008 }}</ref>

==Health care==
[[File:"Tanai Hospital".jpg|thumb|Tanai Hospital]]
The general state of health care in Myanmar is poor. The military government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the country's GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=108&subsecID=900003&contentID=254167 |title=PPI: Almost Half of All World Health Spending is in the United States |date=17 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205231908/http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=108&subsecID=900003&contentID=254167 |archive-date=5 February 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2007/06/28_Burma.shtml |title=Burma junta faulted for rampant diseases |date=28 June 2007 |first=Yasmin |last=Anwar |publisher=UC Berkeley News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702123259/http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2007/06/28_Burma.shtml |archive-date=2 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment. In general, the health care infrastructure outside of [[Yangon]] and [[Mandalay]] is extremely poor but is especially worse in remote areas like Kachin State.
