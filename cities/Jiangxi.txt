The name "Jiangxi" is derived from the [[Circuit (administrative division)|circuit]] administrated under the [[Tang dynasty]] in 733, [[Jiangnanxidao]].{{efn|{{zh|labels=no |c=江南西道 |l=Circuit of Western [[Jiangnan]]}}; Gan: Kongnomsitau) <ref>{{in lang|zh}} [http://www.people.com.cn/GB/shenghuo/1090/2435218.html Origin of the Names of China's Provinces] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427100058/http://www.people.com.cn/GB/shenghuo/1090/2435218.html |date=2016-04-27 }}, ''[[People's Daily Online]]''.</ref>}} The abbreviation for Jiangxi is "{{lang|zh-hans|{{linktext|赣}}}}",{{efn|{{zh|p=Gàn|links=no}}; [[Gan Chinese|Gan]]: Gōm}} for the [[Gan River]] which runs across from the south to the north and flows into the Yangtze River. Jiangxi is also alternately called ''Ganpo Dadi''{{efn|{{lang|zh|贛鄱大地}}}} which literally means the "Great Land of Gan and [[Poyang Lake|Po]]".

After the fall of the Qing dynasty, Jiangxi became one of the earliest bases for the [[Communists]] and many peasants were recruited to join the growing people's revolution. The [[Nanchang Uprising]] took place in Jiangxi on August 1, 1927, during the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Later the Communist leadership hid in the mountains of southern and western Jiangxi, hiding from the Kuomintang's attempts to eradicate them. In 1931, the [[Chinese Soviet Republic]]'s government was established in [[Ruijin]], which is sometimes called the "Former Red Capital",{{efn|{{lang|zh-hans|红色故都}}, Gan: Fūng-set Kū-tu}} or just the "Red Capital". In 1935, after complete encirclement by the Nationalist forces, the Communists broke through and began the [[Long March]] to [[Yan'an]].

The southern half of Jiangxi is hilly and mountainous, with ranges and valleys interspersed; notable mountains and mountain ranges include [[Mountain Lu|Mount Lu]], the [[Jinggang Mountains]] and [[Mount Sanqing]]. The northern half is comparatively lower in altitude. The [[Gan River]] flows through the province.

Although the majority of Jiangxi's population is [[Han Chinese]], Jiangxi is linguistically diverse. It is considered the center of [[Gan Chinese]]; [[Hakka Chinese]], is also spoken to some degree. Jiangxi is rich in mineral resources, leading the provinces of China in deposits of [[copper]], [[tungsten]], [[gold]], [[silver]], [[uranium]], [[thorium]], [[tantalum]], [[niobium]] and [[lithium]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=2023-03-01 |title=China's lithium mining likely to face more scrutiny |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/china-lithium-yichun-idUSKBN2V32I2 |access-date=2023-11-06}}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of Jiangxi}}
Jiangxi is centered on the [[Gan River]] valley, which historically provided the main north–south transport route of south China. The corridor along the Gan River is one of the few easily traveled routes through the otherwise mountainous and rugged terrain of the south-eastern mountains. This open corridor was the primary route for trade and communication between the [[North China Plain]] and the [[Yangtze River]] valley in the north and the territory of modern [[Guangdong]] province in the south. As a result, Jiangxi has been strategically important throughout much of China's history.

Jiangxi was outside the sphere of influence of early Chinese civilization during the [[Shang dynasty]] (16th to 11th centuries BC). It is likely that peoples collectively known as the [[Baiyue]] inhabited the region. During the [[Spring and Autumn period]], the northern part of modern Jiangxi formed the western frontier of the state of [[Wu (state)|Wu]]. After Wu was conquered by the [[Yue (state)|state of Yue]] (a power based in modern northern [[Zhejiang]]) in 473 BC, the state of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] (based in modern [[Hubei]]) took over northern Jiangxi and there may have been some Yue influence in the south. Chu subjugated Yue in 333 BC. In 223 BC, when [[Qin (state)|Qin]] conquered Chu, a majority of the Jiangxi area was recorded to be put under Jiujiang Commandery situated in [[Shou County|Shouchun]] ({{lang|zh-hant|壽春}}).<ref>http://218.65.88.149:8080/was40/detail?record=1&primarykeyvalue=%E9%A2%98%E5%90%8D%3D%E8%B1%AB%E7%AB%A0%E6%95%85%E9%83%A1&channelid=7274{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> However the commandery was ineffective and ended shortly when Qin falls.

[[Yuzhang Commandery]] ({{lang|zh|豫章}}, Gan: Ì-zong) was established in Jiangxi at the beginning of the [[Han dynasty]], possibly before the death of [[Xiang Yu]] in 202 BC, and it was also the first commandery set up by Chinese dynasty in Jiangxi. It was named after the Yuzhang River ({{lang|zh|豫章江}}, Gan: Ì-zong Kong), the original name of Gan River. "Gan" has become the abbreviation of the province. In 201, eight counties were added to the original seven of Qin,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} and three more were established in later years. Throughout most of the Han dynasty the commandery's eighteen counties covered most of the modern province of Jiangxi. The county seats of Nanchang, Gan, Yudu, Luling among others were located at the sites of modern major cities. Other counties, however, have been moved or abolished in later centuries.

Under the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] of the [[Han dynasty]], Yuzhang Commandery was assigned to [[Yangzhou Province]], as part of a trend to establish provinces (''[[zhou (political division)|zhou]]'') all across China. In 291 AD, during the [[Western Jin dynasty]], Jiangxi became its own ''Zhou'' called Jiangzhou ({{lang|zh|江州}}, Gan: Kong-chiu). During the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]], Jiangxi was under the control of the southern dynasties, and the number of ''zhou'' slowly grew.

During the [[Sui dynasty]], there were seven [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]] and twenty-four counties in Jiangxi. During the [[Tang dynasty]], another commandery and fourteen counties were added. Commanderies were then abolished, becoming ''zhou'' (henceforth translated as "prefectures" rather than "provinces").

[[Circuit (administrative division)|Circuits]] were established during the [[Tang dynasty]] as a new top-level administrative division. At first Jiangxi was part of the [[Jiangnan Circuit]] (lit. "Circuit south of the Yangtze"). In 733, this circuit was divided into western and eastern halves. Jiangxi was found in the western half, which was called [[Jiangnanxi Circuit]] (lit. "Western circuits south of the Yangtze"). This is the source of the modern name "Jiangxi".

The [[Tang dynasty]] collapsed in 907, heralding the division of the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] period. Jiangxi first belonged to [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Wu]] ({{lang|zh-hant|吳}}, Gan: Ng), then to [[Southern Tang]] ({{lang|zh|南唐}}, Gan: Nām-thóng). Both states were based in modern-day [[Nanjing]], further down the [[Yangtze River]].

During the [[Song dynasty]], Jiangnanxi Circuit was reestablished with nine prefectures and four army districts (with sixty-eight districts).

During the [[Yuan dynasty]], the circuit was divided into thirteen different circuits, and Jiangxi Province was established for the first time. This province also included the majority of modern [[Guangdong]]. Jiangxi acquired (more or less) its modern borders during the [[Ming dynasty]] after [[Guangdong]] was separated out. There has been little change to the borders of Jiangxi since.

After the fall of the Qing dynasty, Jiangxi became one of the earliest bases for the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communists]] and many peasants were recruited to join the growing people's revolution. The [[Nanchang Uprising]] took place in Jiangxi on August 1, 1927, during the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Later the Communist leadership hid in the mountains of southern and western Jiangxi, hiding from the Kuomintang's attempts to eradicate them. In 1931, the [[Chinese Soviet Republic]]'s government was established in [[Ruijin]], which is sometimes called the "Former Red Capital" ({{lang|zh-hans|红色故都}}, Gan: Fūng-set Kū-tu), or just the "Red Capital". In 1935, after complete encirclement by the Nationalist forces, the Communists broke through and began the [[Long March]] to [[Yan'an]].

From 1930 to 1934, the National Government carried out five military campaigns against the Jiangxi Soviet area. Its brutal two-party battles and cleansing (including the internal cleansing of the Red Army and the cleaning of the post-war government) caused a large number of deaths or escapes, causing the population of Jiangxi to drop by 40%, until only 13.8 million people were left in 1936.

In 1936, after the opening of the [[Guangzhou–Hankou railway|Yuehan Railway]] in Hunan, Jiangxi lost its important position regarding north–south traffic. In 1937, the east-west Zhegan Railway was opened to traffic, which changed the original traffic patterns in Jiangxi to a large extent. The Jiujiang Port ({{lang|zh|九江港}}) began to decline in importance.

Following the [[Doolittle Raid]] during [[World War II]], most of the B-25 American crews that came down in China eventually made it to safety with the help of Chinese civilians and soldiers. The Chinese people who helped them, however, paid dearly for sheltering the Americans. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] began the [[Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign]] to intimidate the Chinese from helping downed American airmen. The Japanese killed an estimated 250,000 civilians of China while searching for Doolittle's men.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/perilousfight/|title=The Perilous Fight: America's World War II in Color |website=PBS }}</ref>

Jiangxi came under the full control of the CCP upon the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. The Republican provincial government was evacuated to [[Taichung]] in [[Taiwan Province]] before dissolving itself that same year.<ref> https://www.culture.taichung.gov.tw/media/827206/文化萬象p53-57.pdf</ref>

==Geography==

[[File:XinYu.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Xinyu City]]
[[File:Ayfg-sjgc-yj21.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Pingxiang City]]

Mountains surround Jiangxi on three sides, with the [[Mufu Mountains]], [[Jiuling Mountains]], and [[Luoxiao Mountains]] on the west; [[Huaiyu Mountains]] and [[Wuyi Mountains]] on the east; and the [[Jiulian Mountains]] ({{lang|zh|九连山}}) and [[Dayu Mountains]] in the south. The southern half of the province is hilly with ranges and valleys interspersed; while the northern half is flatter and lower in altitude. The highest point in Jiangxi is [[Mount Huanggang]] ({{lang|zh-hans|黄岗山}}) in the Wuyi Mountains, on the border with [[Fujian]]. It has an altitude of {{convert|2157|m}}.

The [[Gan River]] dominates the province, flowing through the entire length of the province from south to north. It enters [[Lake Poyang]] in the north, the largest freshwater lake of China; that lake in turn empties into the [[Yangtze River]], which forms part of the northern border of Jiangxi. Important [[Reservoir (water)|reservoirs]] include the [[Xiushui Tuolin Reservoir]] in the northwest of the province on the [[Xiushui River]], and the [[:zh:万安水库|Wan'an Reservoir(zh)]] in the upper section of the Gan.

Jiangxi has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'' under the [[Köppen climate classification]]), with short, cool, damp winters, and very hot, humid summers. Average temperatures are about {{convert|3|to|9|°C|°F}} in January and {{convert|27|to|30|°C|°F}} in July. Annual precipitation is {{convert|1200|to|1900|mm|in}}, much of it falling in the heavy rains occurring in late spring and summer.

[[Nanchang]], the provincial capital and the most densely populated city, is one of the largest Chinese [[metropolis]]es. Nanchang is the hub of [[Culture of Jiangxi|Jiangxi civilization]] throughout its history, which plays a leading role in the commercial, intellectual and industrial and political fields.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.com.cn/culture/txt/2008-11/26/content_16834445_3.htm |title=www.china.com.cn |publisher=China.com.cn |date=2008-11-26 |access-date=2012-12-24}}</ref> [[Ganzhou]] is the largest subdivision of Jiangxi.

Major cities in Jiangxi include:

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Jiangxi|List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China}}
The Politics of Jiangxi is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.

The [[Governor of Jiangxi]] is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Jiangxi. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Jiangxi [[Chinese Communist Party]] Provincial [[Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary|Committee Secretary]], colloquially termed the "Jiangxi CCP Party Chief".

==Culture==
[[Image:Porcelain Workshop, Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, China.jpg|thumb|left|Porcelain workshop in Jingdezhen.]]
{{main|Culture of Jiangxi}}
Jiangxi is the main area of concentration of the [[Gan Chinese|Gan]] varieties of [[Chinese language|Chinese]], spoken over most of the northern two-thirds of the province. Examples include the [[Nanchang dialect]], [[Yichun dialect]] and [[Ji'an dialect]]. The southern one-third of the province speaks [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]]. There are also [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Huizhou Chinese|Huizhou]], and [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] dialects spoken along the northern border.

[[Ganju (Jiangxi Opera)|Ganju]] (Jiangxi opera) is the type of [[Chinese opera]] performed in Jiangxi.

Although little known outside of the province, [[Jiangxi cuisine]] is rich and distinctive. Flavors are some of the strongest in China, with heavy use of [[chili pepper]]s and especially [[pickling|pickled]] and [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] products.

[[Jingdezhen]] is widely regarded as the producer of the best [[porcelain]] in China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.caixinglobal.com/2017-09-15/jingdezhen-where-emperors-got-their-porcelain-101145647.html|title=Jingdezhen: Where Emperors Got Their Porcelain - Caixin Global|website=www.caixinglobal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}</ref>

Jiangxi also was a historical center of [[Chan Buddhism]].

Prominent examples of [[Hakka architecture]] can be found in Jiangxi.

==Transportation==
As of January 2015, Jiangxi had two [[Yangtze River bridges and tunnels|Yangtze River crossings]], both in Jiujiang.

===Rail===
The [[Beijing–Kowloon Railway]] and [[Shanghai–Kunming Railway]] crisscross the province and intersect at Nanchang, which also has a [[Nanchang–Jiujiang Intercity Railway|high-speed rail link to Jiujiang]]. In addition, Jiangxi is connected by rail to Anhui Province via the [[Anhui–Jiangxi Railway|Anhui–Jiangxi]] and [[Tongling–Jiujiang Railway]]s; to Hubei via the [[Wuhan–Jiujiang Railway]]; and to Fujian via the [[Yingtan–Xiamen Railway|Yingtan–Xiamen]], [[Hengfeng–Nanping Railway|Hengfeng–Nanping]], [[Ganzhou–Longyan Railway|Ganzhou–Longyan]] and [[Xiangtang–Putian Railway]]s.

==Tourism==
[[Image:Mount Lushan - fog.JPG|right|thumb|The mountain peaks of Mount Lu National Park.]]
There are several famous mountains in Jiangxi Province, including [[Mount Lu]] in [[Jiujiang]], Mount jinggang at the border of Jiangxi province and Hunan province, Mount Sanqing in Yushan county.

Near the northern port city of [[Jiujiang]] lies the well-known resort area of [[Mount Lu]]. Also near the city is the [[Donglin Temple (Jiujiang)|Donglin Temple]], an important [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple in china.

Near the small city of [[Yingtan]] is the resort area of [[Longhushan]], which purports to be the birthplace of [[Taoism]] and hence has great symbolic value to Taoists. The region has many temples, cave complexes, mountains and villages.

The [[Mountain Lu National Park|Mount Lu National Park]] has been a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] since 1996.

[[Kuling, Jiujiang|Kuling]] located on the top of [[Mountain Lu|Mount Lu]] is a summer resort developed by European in the 19th century. There were 3000 European living in [[Kuling, Jiujiang|Kuling]], Mount Lu, [[Jiujiang]] in summer time in 1920 s.

In 2007, Jiangxi (specifically the [[Mount Lu West Sea]], located in [[Jiujiang]]) was the filming location for the fifteenth series of the American TV show ''[[Survivor: China|Survivor]]''.

==Flora and fauna==
The mountainous terrain and large forest coverage of Jiangxi has made it historically one of the more wild places of central China. [[South China tiger]]s have been seen as recently as fifteen or twenty years ago and projects are underway to document evidence of existing tigers, if there are any. Several mountain areas along the northern border with Hunan and Hubei are potential sites for "wilderness" preserves specifically for protecting or even reintroducing tigers.

Other wildlife, though not plentiful, are more numerous in Jiangxi than in many other developed areas of China. Numerous species of birds are common, especially around the marshes of Lake Poyang in the north. Though protected, mammals such as [[muntjac]], wild boar, civet cats, and [[pangolin]]s, are still common enough that they'll even occasionally be seen in markets for sale as game meat, or possibly even in a forest.

The late [[Paleocene]] [[Mesonychidae|mesonychid]], ''[[Jiangxia chaotoensis]]'' was found in the province, and named after it.
