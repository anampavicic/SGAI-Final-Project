Positioned along the [[Deûle]] river, near France's border with [[Belgium]], it is the capital of the [[Hauts-de-France]] [[Regions of France|region]], the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the [[Nord (French department)|Nord]] [[Departments of France|department]], and the main city of the [[Métropole Européenne de Lille|European Metropolis of Lille]].

More broadly, Lille belongs to a vast [[conurbation]] formed with the [[Belgium|Belgian]] cities of [[Mouscron]], [[Kortrijk]], [[Tournai]] and [[Menen|Menin]], which gave birth in January 2008 to the [[Eurometropolis Lille–Kortrijk–Tournai]], the first [[European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation]] (EGTC), which has more than 2.1 million inhabitants.

Nicknamed in France the "Capital of Flanders", Lille and its surroundings belong to the historical region of [[Romance Flanders]], a former territory of the county of [[Flanders]] that is not part of the linguistic area of [[West Flanders]]. A garrison town (as evidenced by its Citadel), Lille has had an eventful history from the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[French Revolution]]. Very often besieged during its history, it belonged successively to the [[Kingdom of France]], the [[Burgundian State]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]] of Germany and the [[Spanish Netherlands]] before being definitively attached to the France of [[Louis XIV]] following the [[War of the Spanish Succession|War of Spanish Succession]] along with the entire territory making up the historic province of [[French Flanders]]. Lille was again under siege in 1792 during the [[War of the First Coalition|Franco-Austrian War]], and in 1914 and 1940. It was severely tested by the two [[world war]]s of the 20th century during which it was occupied and suffered destruction.

A merchant city since its origins and a manufacturing city since the 16th century, the [[Industrial Revolution]] made it a great industrial capital, mainly around the [[Textile industry|textile]] and mechanical industries. Their decline, from the 1960s onwards, led to a long period of crisis and it was not until the 1990s that the conversion to the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sector]] and the rehabilitation of the disaster-stricken districts gave the city a different face. Today, the historic center, Old Lille, is characterized by its 17th-century red brick town houses, its paved pedestrian streets and its central Grand'Place. The belfry of the {{Lang|fr|[[Hôtel de Ville, Lille|Hôtel de Ville]]|italic=no}} (City Hall) is one of the 23 [[Belfries of Belgium and France|belfries]] in the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] and [[Somme (department)|Somme]] regions that were classified as [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]] in July 2005, in recognition of their architecture and importance to the rise of municipal power in Europe.<ref name = "unesco">{{cite web |url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/943 |title= Belfries of Belgium and France  |website = UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher = United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization |access-date = 5 November 2021}}</ref>

The construction of the brand-new [[Euralille]] business district in 1988 (now the third largest in France) and the arrival of the [[TGV]] and then the [[Eurostar]] in 1994 put Lille at the heart of the major European capitals. The development of its [[Lille Airport|international airport]], annual events such as the [[Braderie de Lille]] in early September (attracting three million visitors), the development of a student and [[University of Lille Nord de France|university]] center (with more than 110,000 students, the third largest in [[Universities in France|France]] behind [[Paris]] and [[Lyon]]), its ranking as a [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2004 and the events of Lille 2004 ([[European Capital of Culture]]) and Lille 3000 are the main symbols of this revival. The [[List of metropolitan areas in Europe|European metropolis]] of Lille was awarded the "World Design Capital 2020".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wdc2020.lillemetropole.fr/en |title=Lille Métropole 2020, Capitale Mondiale Du Design |language=en |access-date=18 September 2021 |archive-date=18 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210918072432/https://wdc2020.lillemetropole.fr/en |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of Lille}}
{{see also|Timeline of Lille}}

===Origins===
Archeological digs seem to show the area as inhabited by as early as 2000 BC,{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} most notably in the modern ''quartiers'' of [[Fives (Lille)|Fives]], [[Wazemmes]] and Vieux Lille. The original inhabitants of the region were the [[Gauls]], such as the [[Menapii|Menapians]], the [[Morini|Morins]], the [[Atrebates]] and the [[Nervii|Nervians]], who were followed by [[Germanic peoples]]: the [[Saxons]], the [[Frisians]] and the [[Franks]].

The legend of "[[Lydéric and Phinaert]]" puts the foundation of the city of Lille at 640. In the 8th century, the language of [[Old Dutch|Old Low Franconian]] was spoken, as attested by [[toponymy|toponymic]] research.{{dubious|date=October 2020}}{{citation_needed|date=October 2020}} Lille's Dutch name is ''Rijsel'', which comes from ''ter ijsel'' (at the island) from [[Middle Dutch]] ''ijssel'' ("small island, islet"), [[calque]] of [[Old French]] l'Isle ("the Island"), itself from [[Latin]] ''Īnsula'', from ''īnsula'' ("island").

From 830 to around 910, the [[Vikings]] invaded Flanders. After the destruction caused by [[Normans]]' and the [[Magyars]]' invasion, the eastern part of the region was ruled by various local princes.

The first mention of the town dates from 1066: ''apud Insulam'' (Latin for "at the island"). It was then controlled by the [[County of Flanders]], as were the regional cities (the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] cities [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]], [[Arras]], [[Cambrai]] as well as the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] cities [[Valenciennes]], [[Saint-Omer]], [[Ghent]] and [[Bruges]]). The County of Flanders thus extended to the left bank of the [[Scheldt]], one of the richest and most prosperous regions of Europe.

===Middle Ages===
The Carolingian duke [[Eberhard of Friuli|Évrard]] lived in the city in the 9th century and participated in many of the day's political and military affairs. There was an important Battle of Lille in 1054. [[Raimbert of Lille]] (fl. c. 1100) was an early [[nominalism|nominalist]] who taught at Lille.<ref name="Poole">{{cite book |last1=Poole |first1=Reginald Lane |author1-link=Reginald Lane Poole |title=Illustrations of the History of Medieval Thought and Learning |date=1960 |publisher=Dover |location=New York, NY |pages=92–93 |edition=2}}</ref>

From the 12th century, the fame of the Lille cloth fair began to grow. In 1144 Saint-Sauveur parish was formed, which would give its name to the modern-day ''quartier Saint-Sauveur''.

The counts of Flanders, [[County of Boulogne|Boulogne]], and [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] came together with England and East Frankia and tried to regain territory taken by [[Philip II of France]] following Henry II of England's death, a war that ended with the French victory at [[Bouvines]] in 1214. [[Infante Ferdinand, Count of Flanders]] was imprisoned and the county fell into dispute: it would be his wife, [[Jeanne, Countess of Flanders]] and [[Constantinople]], who ruled the city. She was said to be well loved by the residents of Lille, who by that time numbered 10,000.

In 1225, the [[street performer]] and [[juggler]] [[Bertrand Cordel]], doubtlessly encouraged by local lords, tried to pass himself off as [[Baldwin I of Constantinople]] (the father of Jeanne of Flanders), who had disappeared at the [[Battle of Adrianople (1205)|battle of Adrianople]]. He pushed the counties of [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] towards sedition against Jeanne in order to recover his land. She called her cousin, [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]] ("The Lion"). He unmasked the imposter, whom Countess Jeanne quickly had hanged. In 1226 the king agreed to free Infante Ferdinand, Count of Flanders. Count Ferrand died in 1233, and his daughter Marie soon after. In 1235, Jeanne granted a city charter by which city governors would be chosen each All Saint's Day by four commissioners chosen by the ruler. On 6 February 1236, she founded the Countess's Hospital ([[Hospice Comtesse]]). It was in her honour that the hospital of the Regional Medical University of Lille was named "Jeanne of Flanders Hospital" in the 20th century.

The Countess died in 1244 in the [[Abbey]] of Marquette, leaving no heirs. The rule of Flanders and Hainaut thus fell to her sister, [[Margaret II, Countess of Flanders]], then to Margaret's son, [[Guy of Dampierre]]. Lille fell under the rule of France from 1304 to 1369, after the [[Franco-Flemish War]] (1297–1305).

The county of Flanders fell to the [[Burgundian State]] next, after the 1369 marriage of [[Margaret III, Countess of Flanders]], and [[Philip the Bold]], Duke of Burgundy. Lille thus became one of the three capitals of said Duchy, along with [[Brussels]] and [[Dijon]]. By 1445, Lille counted some 25,000 residents. [[Philip the Good]], Duke of Burgundy, was even more powerful than the [[List of French monarchs|King of France]], and made Lille an administrative and financial capital.

On 17 February 1454, one year after the [[Fall of Constantinople|taking of Constantinople]] by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]], Philip the Good organised a [[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruelian]] banquet at his Lille palace, the still-celebrated "[[Feast of the Pheasant]]". There the Duke and his court undertook an oath to Christianity.

In 1477, at the death of the last duke of Burgundy, [[Charles the Bold]], [[Mary of Burgundy]] married [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian of Austria]], who thus became Count of Flanders.

===Early modern era===
[[File:Lille, la Vieille Bourse (PA00107639).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Vieille Bourse]] on the Grand' Place]]
The 16th and the 17th centuries were marked by a boom in the regional textile industry, the Protestant revolts and outbreaks of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]].

Lille came under the rule of the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] in 1519. The [[Low Countries]] fell to his eldest son, [[Philip II of Spain]], in 1555. The city remained under [[Spanish Habsburg]] rule until 1668. [[Calvinism]] first appeared in the area in 1542, and by 1555, the authorities were taking steps to suppress that form of [[Protestantism]]. In 1566, the countryside around Lille was affected by the [[Iconoclastic Fury]].{{sfnp|Trenard|1981|p=456}} In 1578, the Hurlus, a group of Protestant rebels, stormed the castle of the Counts of Mouscron. They were removed four months later by a Catholic [[Wallonia|Wallon]] regiment, and they tried several times between 1581 and 1582 to take the city of Lille, all in vain. The Hurlus were notably held back by the legendary [[Jeanne Maillotte]]. At the same time (1581), at the call of [[Elizabeth I of England]], the north of the [[Seventeen Provinces]], having gained a Protestant majority, successfully revolted and formed the [[Dutch Republic]]. The war brought or exacerbated periods of famine and plague (the last in 1667–1679).{{sfnp|Trenard|1981|p=457}}

The first printer to set up shop in Lille was Antoine Tack in 1594. The 17th century saw the building of new institutions: an [[Irish College]] in 1610, a Jesuit college in 1611, an Augustinian college in 1622, almshouses or hospitals such as the Maison des Vieux hommes in 1624 and the Bonne et Forte Maison des Pauvres in 1661, and of a [[mount of piety|Mont-de-piété]] in 1626.{{sfnp|Trenard|1981|pp=456-457}}

[[File:Rijsel, Frankrijk, Sanderus, Flandria Illustrata.jpg|thumb|left|1641 map of Lille in ''[[Flandria Illustrata]]'' by [[Anton Sander]]]]

Unsuccessful French attacks on the city were launched in 1641 and 1645.{{sfnp|Trenard|1981|p=457}} In 1667, [[Louis XIV]] of France (the Sun King) successfully laid [[Siege of Lille (1667)|siege to Lille]], resulting in it becoming French in 1668 under the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], provoking discontent among the citizens of the prosperous city. A number of important public works undertaken between 1667 and 1670, such as the [[Citadel of Lille|Citadel]] (erected by [[Vauban]]), or the creation of the quartiers of Saint-André and la Madeleine, enabled the French king to gradually gain the confidence of his new subjects in Lille, some of whom continued to feel Flemish, but they had always spoken the Romance [[Picard language]].

[[File:Citadelle de Vauban, Lille.JPG|thumb|right|Entrance to the Vauban Citadel (17th century)]]

For five years, from 1708 to 1713, the city was occupied by the Dutch during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. Throughout the 18th century, Lille remained profoundly Catholic. It took little part in the [[French Revolution]], but there were riots and the destruction of churches. In 1790, the city held its first municipal elections.

===Post-French Revolution===
In 1792, in the aftermath of the French Revolution, the [[Austrians]], then in the United Provinces, laid siege to Lille. The "[[Column of the Goddess]]", erected in 1842 in the "Grand-Place" (officially named [[Place du Général-de-Gaulle (Lille)|Place du Général-de-Gaulle]]), is a tribute to the city's resistance, led by [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] {{ill|François André-Bonte|fr}}. Although Austrian artillery destroyed many houses and the main church of the city, the city did not surrender, and the Austrian Army left after eight days.

The city continued to grow and, by 1800, had some 53,000 residents, leading to Lille becoming the seat of the Nord ''département'' in 1804. In 1846, a railway connecting Paris and Lille was built. In the early 19th century, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]]'s [[Continental System|continental blockade]] against the United Kingdom led to Lille's textile industry developing even more fully. The city was known for its cotton while the nearby towns of [[Roubaix]] and [[Tourcoing]] worked wool. Leisure activities were thoroughly organised in 1858 for the 80,000 inhabitants. Cabarets or taverns for the working class numbered 1,300, or one for every three houses. At that time the city counted 63 drinking and singing clubs, 37 clubs for card players, 23 for bowling, 13 for skittles, and 18 for archery. The churches likewise have their social organizations. Each club had a long roster of officers, and a busy schedule of banquets festivals and competitions.<ref>Theodore Zeldin, ''France, 1848-1945, vol. 2, Intellect, Taste and Anxiety'' (1977) pp 2:270-71.</ref> In 1853, [[Alexandre Desrousseaux]] composed his lullaby "[[P'tit Quinquin (song)|P'tit quinquin]]".

In 1858, Lille annexed the adjacent towns of [[Esquermes]], [[Fives, Nord|Fives]], Moulins-Lille and [[Wazemmes]].<ref name=ehess/> Lille's population was 158,000 in 1872, growing to over 200,000 by 1891. In 1896 Lille became the first city in France to be led by a socialist, [[Gustave Delory]].

By 1912, Lille's population stood at 217,000. The city profited from the [[Industrial Revolution]], particularly via coal and the [[steam engine]]. The entire region grew wealthy thanks to its mines and textile industry.

===First World War===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S30293, Frankreich, Lille, Militärparade.jpg|thumb|German military parade in Lille, 1915]]
Lille's occupation by the Germans began on 13 October 1914 after a ten-day siege and heavy shelling, which destroyed 882 apartment and office blocks and 1,500 houses, mostly around the railway station and in the centre. By the end of October, the city was being run by German authorities. Because Lille was only 20&nbsp;km from the battlefield, German troops passed through the city regularly on their way to and from the front. As a result, occupied Lille became a place for the hospitalisation and the treatment of wounded soldiers as well as a place for soldiers' relaxation and entertainment. Many buildings, homes and businesses were requisitioned to those ends.<ref>Wallart, Claudine. [http://www.remembrancetrails-northernfrance.com/history/the-department-of-nord-and-the-coal-basin-under-german-occupation/lille-under-german-rule.html ''Lille under German Rule.''] Remembrance Trails of the Great War. Retrieved 1 January 2016.</ref>

Lille was liberated by the Allies on 17 October 1918, when General Sir [[William Birdwood]] and his troops were welcomed by joyous crowds. The general was made an honorary citizen of the city of Lille on 28 October.

The only{{citation needed|date=June 2022}} audio recording known to have been made during World War I was recorded near Lille in October 1918. The two-minute recording captured the Royal Garrison Artillery conducting a gas shell bombardment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://soundstudiesblog.com/2014/07/07/listening-to-traces-of-war-gas-shell-bombardment-1918/|title = Reproducing Traces of War: Listening to Gas Shell Bombardment, 1918|date = 7 July 2014}}</ref>

Lille was also the hunting ground of the German World War I flying ace [[Max Immelmann]], who was nicknamed "the Eagle of Lille".

===''Années Folles'', Great Depression and Popular Front===
[[File:Lille mairie face.jpg|alt=Lille city hall|left|thumb|upright=0.85|Lille's [[Art Deco]] [[Hôtel de Ville, Lille|Town Hall]] (1932)]]
In July 1921, at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in Lille, [[Albert Calmette]] and [[Camille Guérin]] discovered the first anti-[[tuberculosis]] [[vaccine]], known as [[BCG vaccine|BCG]] ("Bacille de Calmette et Guérin"). The [[Opéra de Lille]], designed by Lille architect [[Louis M. Cordonnier]], was dedicated in 1923.

From 1931, Lille felt the repercussions of the [[Great Depression]], and by 1935, a third of the city's population lived in poverty. In 1936, the city's mayor, [[Roger Salengro]], became [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]] of the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] but eventually killed himself after right-wing groups led a slanderous campaign against him.

===Second World War===

{{main|Lille during World War II}}
During the [[Battle of France]], Lille was besieged by German forces for several days. When Belgium was invaded, the citizens of Lille, still haunted by the events of World War I, began to flee the city in large numbers. Lille was part of the zone under control of the German commander in Brussels, and was never controlled by the [[Vichy France|Vichy government]] in [[German occupation of France during World War II|France]]. Lille was instead controlled under the [[Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France|military administration in Northern France]]. The ''départements'' of Nord and [[Pas-de-Calais]] (with the exception of the coast, notably [[Dunkirk]]) were for the most part liberated from 1 to 5 September 1944, by British, Canadian and Polish troops. On 3 September, German troops began to leave Lille out of fear of the British, who were on their way from Brussels. The city was liberated by a British force consisting largely of tanks.<ref>Landry, Gérard (1982). Lille, Roubaix, Tourcoing sous l'occupation (in French). Rennes: Ouest-France. {{ISBN|9782858824236}}.</ref>

Rationing came to an end in 1947, and by 1948, normality had returned to Lille.

In 1967, the Chamber of Commerce of Lille, Roubaix and Tourcoing were joined, and in 1969 the ''Communauté urbaine de Lille'' (Lille urban community) was created, linking 87 ''[[communes of France|communes]]'' with Lille.

Throughout the 1960s and the 1970s, the region was faced with some problems after the decline of the coal, mining and textile industries. From the early 1980s, the city began to turn itself more towards the [[tertiary sector of economic activity|service sector]].

Pierre Mauroy served as Mayor of Lille for 28 years from 1973 to 2001. Mauroy was Prime Minister for part of the term of Francois Mitterrand.

In 1983, the [[Véhicule Automatique Léger|VAL]], the world's first automated [[rapid transit]] underground network, opened. In 1993, a high-speed [[TGV]] train line was opened connecting Paris with Lille in one hour. This, with the opening of the [[Channel Tunnel]] in 1994 and the arrival of the [[Eurostar]] train put Lille at the centre of a triangle connecting Paris, London and Brussels.

Work on Euralille, an urban remodelling project, began in 1991. The Euralille Centre was opened in 1994, and the remodeled district is now full of parks and modern buildings containing offices, shops and apartments. In 1994 the "Grand Palais" was also opened for the general public, which is free for the public to enter on the first Sunday of every month.

Lille was chosen as a [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2004,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.mairie-lille.fr/cms/Welcome/Culture-leisure/european-capital-of-culture |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615231323/http://en.mairie-lille.fr/cms/Welcome/Culture-leisure/european-capital-of-culture |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 June 2013 |title=Lille 2004 European Capital of Culture |work=mairie-lille.fr}}</ref> along with the [[Italy|Italian]] city of [[Genoa]].

Lille and Roubaix were affected by the [[2005 French riots|2005 riots]], like all of France's other urban centres.

In 2007 and again in 2010, Lille was awarded the label "Internet City".{{by whom|date=January 2020}}{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

The [[Saint-Joseph Chapel of Saint-Paul College in Lille|Saint-Joseph Chapel of Saint-Paul College]] was demolished in February 2021.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lille : des militants identitaires s'opposent à la démolition de la chapelle Saint-Joseph|url=https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/hauts-de-france/nord-0/lille/lille-militants-identitaires-s-opposent-demolition-chapelle-saint-joseph-1913458.html|access-date=27 February 2021|website=France 3 Hauts-de-France|language=fr-FR}}</ref>

==Climate==

==Environment==
Lille is noted for its air pollution, with a 2018 study attributing 1,700 deaths per year in the agglomeration of Lille to pollution. In 2018, Lille held France's record pollution peaks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lavdn.lavoixdunord.fr/507534/article/2018-12-15/lille-60e-jour-de-pollution-cette-annee-l-oms-en-recommande-3 |title=Particules fines À Lille, un 60e jour de pollution cette année alors que l'OMS en recommande 3 maximum... |language=fr|website=lavoixdunord.fr|date=15 December 2018|access-date=27 January 2020}}</ref>

==Population==

The population data in the table and graph to the left below refer to the commune of Lille proper in its borders since 2000, i.e. a municipal territory of {{convert|35|km²|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. This includes the former communes annexed by the commune of Lille: [[Esquermes]], [[Fives, Nord|Fives]], Moulins-Lille, and [[Wazemmes]] in 1858, [[Hellemmes-Lille]] in 1977, and [[Lomme]] in 2000.<ref name=ehess>{{Cassini-Ehess|19581|Lille}}</ref>

The Lille [[metropolitan area]] (table to the right below), which is much larger than the small commune of Lille proper, covers a territory of {{convert|1666|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} (French part of the metropolitan area only) and had a population of 1,515,061 in 2020 (Jan. census).<ref name="AAV_pop" />

==Economy==
[[File:Lille chambre de commerce.jpg|thumb|upright|Lille's Chamber of Commerce]]
A former major [[Machine|mechanical]], [[food industry]] and textile manufacturing centre as well as a retail and finance center, Lille is the largest city of a conurbation, built like a network of cities: Lille, [[Roubaix]], Tourcoing and [[Villeneuve-d'Ascq]]. The conurbation forms the [[Métropole Européenne de Lille]] which is France's fourth-largest urban conglomeration with a 2016 population of over 1.15 million.<ref>Louis Boisgibault, Fahad Al Kabbani (2020): [http://www.iste.co.uk/book.php?id=1591 ''Energy Transition in Metropolises, Rural Areas and Deserts'']. Wiley - ISTE. (Energy series) {{ISBN|9781786304995}}.</ref>

===Revenues and taxes===
For centuries, Lille, a city of merchants, has displayed a wide range of incomes: great wealth and poverty have lived side by side, especially until the end of the 1800s. This contrast was noted by [[Victor Hugo]] in 1851 in his poem [[Les Châtiments]]: « ''Caves de Lille ! on meurt sous vos plafonds de pierre !'' » ("Cellars of Lille! We die under your stone ceilings!")

===Employment===
Employment in Lille has switched over half a century from a predominant industry to tertiary activities and services.
Services account for 91% of employment in 2006.

==Main sights==
[[File:Lille Euratechnologies.JPG|EuraTechnologies cluster|thumb]]Lille features an array of architectural styles with various amounts of Flemish influence, including the use of brown and red brick. In addition, many residential neighborhoods, especially in Greater Lille, consist of attached two- to three-storey houses aligned in a row, with narrow gardens in the back. These architectural attributes, many uncommon in France, help make Lille a transition in France to neighboring Belgium, as well as nearby Netherlands and England, where the presence of brick, as well as row houses or the [[terraced house]] is much more prominent.

Points of interest include
* [[Birthplace of Charles de Gaulle]]
* [[Lille Cathedral]] (''Basilique-cathédrale Notre-Dame-de-la-Treille'')
* [[Citadel of Lille]]
* [[Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille]]
* [[Jardin botanique de la Faculté de Pharmacie]]
* [[Jardin botanique Nicolas Boulay]]
* [[Jardin des Plantes de Lille]]
* [[Maison Folie Moulins]]
* [[Lille Synagogue]]

===La Braderie===
{{main|Braderie de Lille}}
Lille hosts an annual [[braderie]] on the first weekend in September.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.mairie-lille.fr/cms/Welcome/discovering-lille/september-braderie |title=The September 'Braderie' |work=mairie-lille.fr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331065542/http://en.mairie-lille.fr/cms/Welcome/discovering-lille/september-braderie |archive-date=31 March 2015 }}</ref> Its origins are thought to date back to the twelfth century and between two and three million visitors are drawn into the city. It is one of the largest gatherings of France and the largest [[flea market]] in Europe.

Many of the roads in the inner city (including much of the old town) are closed and local shops, residents and traders set up stalls in the street.

==Transport==

===Public transport===

{{Main|Ilevia}}
The [[Métropole Européenne de Lille]] has a mixed mode public transport system, which is considered one of the most modern in the whole of France. It comprises buses, trams and a driverless [[light metro]] system, all of which are operated under the Transpole name. The [[Lille Metro]] is a VAL system (''véhicule automatique léger'' = light automated vehicle) that opened on 16 May 1983, becoming the first automatic light metro line in the world. The system has two lines, with a total length of {{convert|45|km|0|abbr=off}} and 60 stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.mairie-lille.fr/cms/page2941.html |title=Public Transport |work=mairie-lille.fr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908195708/http://en.mairie-lille.fr/cms/page2941.html |archive-date= 8 September 2014 }}</ref> The tram system consists of two interurban tram lines, connecting central Lille to the nearby communities of Roubaix and Tourcoing, and has 45 stops. Sixty-eight urban bus routes cover the metropolis, 8 of which reach into Belgium.<ref name=somltrav>{{cite web | title = Travel & Transport | url = http://www.mairie-lille.fr/sections/site-en/Lille_pratique/travel-transport | publisher=La mairie de Lille | access-date =18 February 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080131220539/http://www.mairie-lille.fr/sections/site-en/Lille_pratique/travel-transport <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 31 January 2008}}</ref>

===Railways===
[[File:Lille Gare.JPG|thumb|Lille Flandres railway station]]
Lille is an important junction in the European [[high-speed rail]] network. It lies on the Eurostar line to London (80-minute journey). The French TGV network also puts it only 1 hour from Paris and 38 minutes from Brussels<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.mairie-lille.fr/cms/page2942.html |title=Coming by train |work=mairie-lille.fr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908200024/http://en.mairie-lille.fr/cms/page2942.html |archive-date= 8 September 2014 }}</ref> and connects it to other major centres in France such as Marseille, Lyon and Toulouse. Lille has two railway stations next to each other: [[Lille-Europe station]] (''Gare de Lille-Europe''), which primarily serves high-speed trains and international services (Eurostar), and [[Lille-Flandres station]] (''Gare de Lille-Flandres''), which primarily serves lower-speed regional trains and regional [[National Railway Company of Belgium|Belgian]] trains.

===Highways===
[[File:Lille Autouroutes.svg|thumb|right|Lille: motorway network]]
Five ''autoroutes'' pass by Lille, the densest confluence of highways in France after Paris:
* [[A27 autoroute|Autoroute A27]] : Lille – Tournai – Brussels / Liège – Germany
* [[A23 autoroute|Autoroute A23]] : Lille – Valenciennes
* [[A1 autoroute (France)|Autoroute A1]] : Lille – Arras – Paris / Reims – Lyon / Orléans / Le Havre
* [[A25 autoroute|Autoroute A25]] : Lille – Dunkirk – Calais – England / North Belgium
* [[A22 autoroute|Autoroute A22]] : Lille – Antwerp – Netherlands

A sixth one—the A24—would have linked Amiens to Lille if built, but the project was rejected several times then abandoned.

===Air traffic===
[[Lille Lesquin International Airport]] is 15 minutes from the city centre by car (11&nbsp;km). In terms of shipping, it ranks fourth, with almost 38,000 tonnes of freight which pass through each year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lille Lesquin (LFQQ)|url=https://www.avsim.com/pages/1108/FranceVFR/LFQQ.htm|website=AVSIM|access-date=25 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225092124/https://www.avsim.com/pages/1108/FranceVFR/LFQQ.htm|archive-date=25 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Its passenger traffic, around 1.2 million in 2010, is modest due to the proximity to Brussels, Charleroi, and Paris-CDG airports. The airport mostly connects other French and European cities (some with [[low-cost airline]]s).

===Waterways===
[[File:Port Lille train peniches (1).jpg|Port de Lille|thumb]]
Lille is the third-largest French river port after Paris and [[Strasbourg]]. The river Deûle is connected to regional waterways with over {{Cvt|680|km|0}} of navigable waters. The Deûle connects to Northern Europe via the river [[Scarpe (river)|Scarpe]] and the river Scheldt (towards Belgium and the Netherlands), and internationally via the [[Lys (river)|Lys]] (to Dunkerque and [[Calais]]).
