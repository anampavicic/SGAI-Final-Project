'''Mandalay''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|æ|n|d|ə|ˈ|l|eɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|n|d|əl|eɪ}}; {{MYname|MY=မန္တလေး|MLCTS=manta.le:}} {{IPA-my|màndəlé|}}) is the second-largest city in [[Myanmar]], after [[Yangon]]. Located on the east bank of the [[Irrawaddy River]], 631&nbsp;km (392 miles; road distance) north of Yangon, the city has a population of 1,225,553 (2014 census).

Mandalay was founded in 1857 by King [[Mindon Min|Mindon]], replacing [[Amarapura]] as the new royal capital of the [[Konbaung dynasty]]. It was Burma's final royal capital before the kingdom's [[annexation]] by the [[British Empire]] in 1885. Under British rule, Mandalay remained commercially and culturally important despite the rise of Yangon, the new capital of British Burma. The city suffered extensive destruction during the [[Japanese conquest of Burma]] in the [[World War II|Second World War]]. In 1948, Mandalay became part of the newly independent Union of Burma.

Today, Mandalay is the economic centre of [[Upper Myanmar]] and considered the centre of Burmese culture. A continuing influx of irregular [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] immigrants, mostly from [[Yunnan]], since the late 20th century, has reshaped the city's ethnic makeup and increased commerce with China.<ref name=iiss/><ref name=jt/>{{dead link|date=August 2020}} Despite [[Naypyidaw]]'s recent rise, Mandalay remains Upper Myanmar's main commercial, educational and health center.

==Etymology==
The city gets its name from the nearby [[Mandalay Hill]]. The name is probably a derivative of a [[Pali]] word, although the exact word of origin remains unclear. The root word has been speculated to be ''{{IAST|[[mandala|maṇḍala]]}}'' (မဏ္ဍလ), referring to circular plains<ref name=mdy-150>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no471/n001.htm |title=Mandalay marks 150th birthday |author=Zon Pann Pwint, Minh Zaw and Khin Su Wai |date=18–24 May 2009 |journal=[[The Myanmar Times]] |access-date=23 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602044006/http://www.mmtimes.com/no471/n001.htm |archive-date=2 June 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> or ''[[Mount Mandara|Mandara]]'', a mountain from Hindu mythology.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Names and Their Histories: A Handbook of Historical Geography and Topographical Nomenclature |url=https://archive.org/details/namesandtheirhi01taylgoog |page=[https://archive.org/details/namesandtheirhi01taylgoog/page/n200 186] |author=Issac Taylor |publisher=Rivingtons |year=1898 |edition=2nd}}</ref>

When it was founded in 1857, the royal city was officially named '''Yadanarbon''' ({{my|ရတနာပုံ}}, {{IPA-my|jədənàbòʊɰ̃|}}), a loan of the Pali name '''Ratanapūra''' ({{my|ရတနပူရ}}) "City of Gems."<ref>{{cite web |author=ဦးဟုတ်စိန် |url=http://dictionary.sutta.org/browse/r/ratana |title=Entry for ratana |work=ပါဠိမြန်မာ အဘိဓာန် (Pāḷi-Myanmar Dictionary) |publisher=Pali Canon E-Dictionary Version 1.94 |access-date=15 February 2015 |language=my}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=ဦးဟုတ်စိန် |url=http://dictionary.sutta.org/browse/p/pūra |title=Entry for pūra |work=ပါဠိမြန်မာ အဘိဓာန် (Pāḷi-Myanmar Dictionary) |publisher=Pali Canon E-Dictionary Version 1.94 |access-date=15 February 2015 |language=my}}</ref> It was also called ''Lay Kyun Aung Myei'' ({{my|လေးကျွန်းအောင်မြေ}}, {{IPA-my|lé dʑʊ́ɰ̃ àʊɰ̃ mjè|}}, "Victorious Land over the Four Islands") and [[Mandalay Palace]] ({{my|မြနန်းစံကျော်}}, {{IPA-my|mja̰ náɰ̃ sàɰ̃ tɕɔ̀|}}, "Famed Royal Emerald Palace").

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:King-Mindon.jpg|left|thumb|King [[Mindon Min|Mindon]] is the founder of Mandalay royal capital]]
Like most former (and present) capitals of Burma, Mandalay was founded on the wishes of the ruler of the day. On 13 February 1857, King [[Mindon Min|Mindon]] founded a new royal capital at the foot of [[Mandalay Hill]], ostensibly to fulfill a prophecy on the founding of a metropolis of Buddhism in that exact place on the occasion of the 2,400th jubilee of Buddhism.<ref name="mandalay palace">{{Cite web |url=http://www.lib.washington.edu/asp/myanmar/pdfs/MP0001a.pdf |title=Mandalay Palace |publisher=Directorate of Archaeological Survey, Burma |access-date=22 August 2006 |year=1963}}</ref>[[File:Thu-Da-Mar wayside public resthouse.jpg|left|thumb|The ''Thudamma'' [[zayat]]s built during the reign of [[Mindon Min]]]]The new capital city site was {{cvt|25.5|sqmi|km2|order=flip}} in area, surrounded by four rivers. The plan called for a 144-square block grid patterned citadel, anchored by a 16 square block royal palace compound at the center by Mandalay Hill.<ref name=kt>{{Cite book |title=The Management of Secondary Cities in south-east Asia.

In June 1857, the former royal palace of [[Amarapura]] was dismantled and moved by elephants to the new location at the foot of Mandalay Hill, although construction of the palace compound was officially completed only two years later, on Monday, 23 May 1859.<ref name="mandalay palace"/>

For the next 26 years, Mandalay was to be the last royal capital of the [[Konbaung dynasty]], the last independent Burmese kingdom before its final [[annexation]] by the [[British Empire]]. Mandalay ceased to be the capital on 28 November 1885 when the British conquered the city and sent [[Thibaw Min]] and his queen [[Supayalat]] into exile in India. Moreover, a group of drunken soldiers set fire to the [[Pitakataik (Mandalay)|Pitakataik]] (Royal Library) which had contained the genealogies of kings and the kingdom's official records. Mandalay was razed. However, the palace, its structures and the city walls were spared destruction.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Myint-U |first=Thant |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sX6lDwAAQBAJ |title=The Hidden History of Burma: A Crisis of Race and Capitalism |date=2020-01-16 |publisher=Atlantic Books |isbn=978-1-78649-789-5 |language=en |chapter=Chapter 1}}</ref>

[[File:Baker's shop, Mandalay Chinatown.jpg|left|thumb|Old street scene in Chinatown of Mandalay during the British colonial period]]While Mandalay would continue to be the chief city of Upper Burma during the British colonial rule, the commercial and political importance had irreversibly shifted to Yangon. The British view on the development of Mandalay (and Burma) was mainly with commercial intentions. While rail transport reached Mandalay in 1889,<ref name="white">{{Cite book |title=A Civil Servant in Burma |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924022998938 |author=Herbert Thirkell White |publisher=E.

Throughout the colonial years, Mandalay was the centre of Burmese culture and Buddhist learning, and as the last royal capital, was regarded by the Burmese as a primary symbol of sovereignty and identity. Between the two World Wars, the city was Upper Burma's focal point in a series of nationwide protests against the British rule. The British rule brought in many immigrants from India to the city. In 1904–1905, a plague caused about one-third of the population to flee the city.<ref name="mdy-150" />

[[File:The British Army in Burma 1945 SE3271.jpg|thumb|Troops of [[19th Infantry Division (India)|19th Indian Division]] and a Lee tank in action during street fighting in Mandalay, 9–10 March 1945.]]
During [[World War II]], Mandalay suffered devastating air raids. On 3 April 1942, during the [[Japanese conquest of Burma]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service]] carried out an extensive assault. The city was in effect defenseless as its firefighting resources were weak, having been lost in earlier bombing, it had no anti-aircraft capacity, and the British [[RAF]] had by now withdrawn all its aircraft to India. Three-fifths of Mandalay's houses were destroyed and 2,000 civilians were killed.<ref>[http://history.howstuffworks.com/world-war-ii/axis-conquers-philippines9.htm The Axis Conquers the Philippines: January 1942 – July 1942] ''history.howstuffworks.com'', accessed 21 March 2021</ref><ref>[http://www.worldwar-2.net/timelines/asia-and-the-pacific/asian-mainland/asian-mainland-index-1942.htm World War II net] ''www.worldwar-2.net'', accessed 21 March 2021</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cghbp0WbhxAC&q=Japanese+bombing+of+Rangoon+civilians&pg=PA41 |title=The British Empire and the Second World War |first=Ashley |last=Jackson |date=10 May 2006 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Academic]] |pages=41 |isbn=9781852854171}}</ref> Many residents also fled when the city was under [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese]] occupation from May 1942 to March 1945. The palace citadel, which had been turned into a supply depot by the Japanese, was in turn burnt to the ground by Allied bombing; only the royal [[mint (coin)|mint]] and the watch tower survived. (A faithful replica of the palace was rebuilt in the 1990s.)

===Contemporary Mandalay (1948–present)===
After the country gained independence from Britain in 1948, Mandalay continued to be the main cultural, educational and economic hub of Upper Burma. Until the early 1990s, most students from Upper Burma went to Mandalay for university education. Until 1991, [[Mandalay University]], the [[University of Medicine, Mandalay]] and the [[Defence Services Academy]] were the only three universities in Upper Burma. Only a few other cities had "Degree Colleges" affiliated with Mandalay University that offered a limited number of subjects. Today, the city attracts a fraction of students as the military government requires students to attend their local universities in order to reduce concentration of students in one place.

In November 1959, Mandalay celebrated its centennial with a festival at the foot of Mandalay Hill. Special [[commemorative stamp]]s were issued.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cgi.ebay.com/BURMA-First-Day-Cover-MANDALAY-CENTENARY-1959-CACHET_W0QQitemZ390007523149QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?_trksid=p3286.m20.l1116#ebayphotohosting |title=Mandalay Centenary Stamps |publisher=[[eBay]] |access-date=25 January 2009}}</ref>

During [[Ne Win]]'s isolationist rule (1962–1988), the city's infrastructure deteriorated. By the early 1980s, the second largest city of Burma resembled a town with low-rise buildings and dusty streets filled mostly with bicycles. In the 1980s, the city was hit by two major fires. In May 1981, a fire razed more than 6,000 houses and public buildings, leaving more than 90,000 homeless.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |date=1984-03-24 |title=BURMA - Fire |url=https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pbaab316.pdf |website=Agency for International Development}}</ref> On 24 March 1984, another fire destroyed 2,700 buildings and made 23,000 people homeless.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E6D71139F935A15750C0A962948260 |title=23,000 Homeless in Burma Fire |publisher=[[New York Times]] via [[Reuters]] |date=26 March 1984 |access-date=25 January 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ocha-gwapps1.unog.ch/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/ACOS-64BUBF?OpenDocument |title=Myanmar Fire Mar 1984 UNDRO Information Reports 1 – 2 |publisher=ReliefWeb |date=27 March 1984 |access-date=25 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429184742/http://ocha-gwapps1.unog.ch/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/ACOS-64BUBF?OpenDocument |archive-date=29 April 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The fire caused US$96 million in property damage.<ref name=":0" />

Fires continue to plague the city.

=== Illegal Chinese immigration ===
The 1980s fires augured a significant change in the city's physical character and ethnic makeup. Huge swaths of land left vacant by the fires were later purchased, mostly by the [[Chinese people in Myanmar|ethnic Han Chinese]], many of whom were recent immigrants from [[Yunnan]].<ref name=crtm>{{cite magazine |title=The Chinese Road to Mandalay |url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=15404 |author=Min Lwin |date=April 2009 |magazine=The Irrawaddy}}</ref> The Chinese influx accelerated after the [[State Peace and Development Council]] came to power in 1988. Many Chinese immigrants from Yunnan and, to a lesser extent, [[Sichuan]] poured into [[Upper Burma]] in the 1990s and many ending up in Mandalay, living illegally there.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chang|first=Wen-Chin|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/904979076|title=Beyond borders : stories of Yunnanese Chinese migrants of Burma|date=2014|isbn=978-0-8014-5451-6|location=Ithaca|oclc=904979076}}</ref><ref name=jt/> In the 1990s alone, about 250,000 to 300,000 Yunnanese are estimated to have migrated to Mandalay.<ref name=pks>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/acd/cg/ir/college/bulletin/e-vol1/1-3shee.pdf |title=The Political Economy of China–Myanmar Relations: Strategic and Economic Dimensions |author=Poon Kim Shee |year=2002 |journal=Ritsumeikan Annual Review of International Studies |publisher=Ritsumeikan University |access-date=11 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052220/http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/acd/cg/ir/college/bulletin/e-vol1/1-3shee.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Today, ethnic Chinese people are believed to make up about 40%–50% of the city's population that is nearly the same as the natives,<ref name=pks/> and are a major factor in the city's doubling of population from about 500,000 in 1980 to one million in 2008.

Despite the rise of Naypyidaw, the country's capital since 2006, Mandalay remains Upper Burma's main commercial, educational and health center. In October 2018, Mandalay was ranked by CIO Asia as number fifth among the top 10 cities in Southeast Asia in the process of becoming a [[smart city]] for [[ASEAN Smart Cities Network]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cio-asia.com/article/3315258/internet-of-things/top-10-smart-cities-in-southeast-asia.html |title=Top 10 Smart Cities in Southeast Asia |access-date=23 November 2018 |archive-date=23 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123200956/https://www.cio-asia.com/article/3315258/internet-of-things/top-10-smart-cities-in-southeast-asia.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Txu-oclc-6654394-nf-47-7th-ed.jpg|thumb|Map of Mandalay and surrounding region from the [[International Map of the World]] (1971)]]
Mandalay is located in the central [[Dry Zone (Myanmar)|Dry Zone]] of Burma by the Irrawaddy river at 21.98° North, 96.08° East, 80 meters (260&nbsp;feet) above sea level. Its standard time zone is UTC/GMT +6:30&nbsp;hours and is 626&nbsp;km from Yangon.

Mandalay lies along the [[Sagaing Fault]], a [[tectonic plate]] boundary between the [[India Plate|India]] and [[Sunda Plate|Sunda]] plates. The biggest earthquake in its history, occurred on [[1839 Ava earthquake|23 March 1839]], an estimated magnitude 8.2 destroyed the former capital [[Inwa|Ava]] and caused extreme destruction in nearby cities. The most recent quake was a [[moment magnitude scale|magnitude]] of 7, occurred in 1956.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.geologie.ens.fr/~vigny/articles/2002JB001999.pdf |author=Christophe Vigny |title=Present-day crustal deformation around Sagaing fault, Myanmar |publisher=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]], vol&nbsp;108, 19 November 2003 |pages=2–4 |access-date=25 January 2009|display-authors=etal}}</ref> The devastation was greatest in nearby [[Sagaing]], and it came to be known as the [[1956 Sagaing earthquake|Great Sagaing Quake]].

Bodies of water near Mandalay are Mandalay Kantawgyi, a small lake and [[Irrawaddy River]] to the west of the city.

==Climate==
Although the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Arakan Mountains]] is powerful, the city qualifies as having a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] (Köppen climate classification: ''Aw''), bordering a [[semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|hot semi-arid climate]] (Köppen climate classification: ''BSh''). Mandalay features noticeably warmer and cooler periods of the year. Average temperatures in January, the mildest month, hovers around {{cvt|22|°C|1|disp=or}} while the hottest month, April, averages {{cvt|32|°C|1|disp=or}}. Mandalay is very hot in the months of April and May, with average high temperatures easily exceeding {{cvt|37|°C|disp=or}}. It is not uncommon to see high temperatures surpass {{cvt|40|°C|disp=or}} during these two months in the city. Mandalay also features [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season|dry]] seasons of nearly equal length, with the wet season running from May through October and the dry season covering the remaining six months. The highest reliably recorded temperature in Mandalay is {{cvt|45.0|°C|°F}} on 12 May 2010 while the lowest is {{cvt|7.6|°C|°F}} on 26 December 1999.<ref name=meteoclimat/> There is considerably more [[diurnal temperature variation]] in the dry season than the wet season.

If using climate data of 1981-2010 years, Mandalay features the frank [[hot semi-arid climate]] (''BSh'').

==Cityscape==
===Around the city===
[[File:20160729 Atumashi Mandalay 5865.jpg|thumb|[[Atumashi Monastery]] has been rebuilt as a faithful replica of the original destroyed by a fire.]]
* [[Atumashi Monastery]]:  The "Atumashi [[kyaung]]", which literally means "inimitable [[vihara]]", is also one of the well known sights. The original structure was destroyed by a fire in 1890 though the masonry plinth survived. The reconstruction project was started by the government on 2 May 1995 and completed in June 1996.
* [[Buddha's Replica Tooth Relic Pagoda]]:  One of the Buddha's Sacred Replica Tooth Relics was enshrined in the Mandalay Swedaw Pagoda on Maha Dhammayanthi Hill in [[Amarapura]] Township. The pagoda was built with cash donations contributed by the peoples of Burma and Buddhist donors from around the world under the supervision of the State Peace and Development Council. The authorities and donors hoisted Buddha's Replica Tooth Relic Pagoda Mandalay's ''Shwe Htidaw'' (sacred golden umbrella), ''Hngetmyatnadaw'' (sacred bird perch vane) and ''Seinhpudaw'' (sacred diamond bud) on 13 December 1996.[[File:mandalay kuthodaw.jpg|thumb|[[Kuthodaw Pagoda]] – Some of the 729 [[stupa]]s known as the [[world's largest book]]]]
* [[Kuthodaw Pagoda]] (The World's Biggest Book):  Built by King Mindon in 1857, this pagoda modeled on the [[Shwezigon Pagoda]] at [[Nyaung-U]], is surrounded by 729 upright stone slabs on which are inscribed the entire ''[[Tripiṭaka|Tipiṭaka]]'' as edited and approved by the [[Fifth Buddhist council]]. It is popularly known as "[[World's largest book]]" for its stone scriptures.
* [[Kyauktawgyi Buddha Temple (Mandalay)|Kyauktawgyi Pagoda]]: Near the southern approach to Mandalay Hill stands the Kyauktawgyi Buddha image built by King Mindon in 1853–78. The Image was carved out of a huge single block of marble. Statues of 80 [[arhat|arahants]] are assembled around the Image, twenty on each side. The carving was completed in 1865.
* [[Mahamuni Buddha Temple]]: The image of Gautama Buddha at Mahamuni Buddha Temple is said to have been cast in the life-time of the Gautama Buddha and that the Buddha embraced it seven times, thereby bringing it to life. Consequently, devout Buddhists hold it to be alive and refer to it as the Mahamuni Sacred Living Image. Revered as the holiest pagoda in Mandalay, It was built by King [[Bodawpaya]] in 1784. The image in a sitting posture is 12&nbsp;feet and 7&nbsp;inches (3.8&nbsp;m) high. As the image was brought from [[Rakhine State]], it was also called the Great Rakhine Buddha. The early morning ritual of washing the Face of Buddha Image draws a large crowd of devotees every day.[[File:Irrawaddy Mandalay-Hill.JPG|thumb|[[Mandalay Hill]], at 790&nbsp;ft (240&nbsp;m), is home to many of Mandalay's religious sites.]] 
* [[Mandalay Hill]]:  The hill has for long been a holy mount. Legend has it that the Buddha, on his visit, had prophesied that a great city would be founded at its foot. Mandalay Hill, 230&nbsp;metres high, provides a view of the city and surrounding countryside. The construction of a motor road to reach the hill-top has already been finished.
* [[Mandalay Palace]]:  The whole palace complex was destroyed by a fire during World War II. The palace walls, the city gates with their crowning wooden pavilions and the surrounding moat, "Mya-nan-san-kyaw Shwenandaw", were rebuilt using forced labor. A model of the Mandalay Palace, Nanmyint-saung and [[Mandalay Cultural Museum]] are located inside the palace grounds.
[[File:Mandalay, Shwe Nan Daw 01.jpg|thumb|[[Shwenandaw Monastery]]]]
* [[Shwenandaw Monastery]]: known for its wood carvings, it was a part of the old palace. In 1880 it was moved by King Thibaw to its current site close to Atumashi Monastery.[[File:U Bein Bridge Mandalay 4.jpg|thumb|[[U Bein Bridge]]]]
*[[U Bein Bridge]] : known for the oldest and (once) longest teakwood bridge in the world. It was constructed when the capital of Ava Kingdom moved to Amarapura .
* [[Yadanabon Zoological Gardens]]: A small zoo between the [[Mandalay Palace]] and [[Mandalay Hill]]. It has over 300 species and is notably the only zoo to have [[Burmese roofed turtle]]s.

==Administration==
[[File:Headquater of MCDC.jpg|thumb|Mandalay City Hall and MCDC Headquarter]]
The [[Mandalay Region Government]] is the government for Mandalay Region including Mandalay City. The [[Mandalay City Development Committee]] (MCDC) is municipal organization for Mandalay City. The [[Mandalay District]] consists of seven townships.

==Transport==
Mandalay's strategic location in Central Burma makes it an important hub for transport of people and goods. The city is connected to other parts of the country and to China and India by multiple modes of transportation.

===Air===
[[File:Mandalay airport 1.jpg|thumb|Mandalay International Airport]]
[[Mandalay International Airport]] (MDL) was one of the largest and most modern airports in Myanmar until the modernization of [[Yangon International Airport]] in 2008. Built at a cost of US$150&nbsp;million in 2000, it is highly underused; it serves mostly domestic flights with the exception of those to [[Kunming]] and to/from [[Bangkok]] and Chiang Mai, with daily flights on Air Asia and Bangkok Airways.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bangkokair.com/eng/pages/view/flight-schedule |title=Flight Schedule |access-date=2015-05-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505081016/http://www.bangkokair.com/eng/pages/view/flight-schedule |archive-date=5 May 2015}}</ref> The airport has come to represent the military regime's propensity for bad planning and penchant for [[white elephant]] projects.<ref name=mia>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=25 |title=Junta's New White Elephant Project is Paying Off |author=Maung Maung Oo |magazine=[[The Irrawaddy]] |date=26 November 2001 |access-date=26 December 2008 |archive-date=23 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323123805/http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Myanmar's recent opening stance on tourism means the airport is now receiving a growing number of visitors from Bangkok and Chiang Mai.

The airport is far from the city, {{cvt|45|km}} on a modern highway. Before the construction of this airport, [[Mandalay Chanmyathazi Airport]] was the main airport of the city. The airport serves some flights to Myanmar towns.

===River===
The [[Ayeyarwady River]] remains an important arterial route for transporting goods such as farm produce including rice, beans and pulses, cooking oil, pottery, bamboo and teak.

===Rail===
[[File:Mandalay Central Station.JPG|thumb|Central Railway Station on 78th and 30th]]
[[Mandalay Central Railway Station]] is the terminus of [[Myanmar Railways]]'s [[metre gauge]] main rail line from Yangon ([[Yangon–Mandalay Railway]]) and the starting point of branch lines to [[Pyin U Lwin]] (Maymyo), [[Lashio]] ([[Mandalay–Lashio Railway]]), [[Monywa]], [[Pakokku]], [[Kalemyo|Kalay]], [[Gangaw]], and to the north, [[Shwebo]], [[Kawlin]], [[Naba, Sagaing|Naba]], [[Kanbalu]], [[Mohnyin]], [[Hopin (Kachin State)|Hopin]], [[Mogaung]] and [[Myitkyina]] ([[Mandalay–Myitkyina Railway]]).

Mandalay has a station on the [[standard gauge]] [[Kunming]], [[China]] - [[Kyaukphyu]] port railway.


Mandalay does not have an intra-city [[rapid transit|metro rail]] system. The former [[Trams in Mandalay]] has been decommissioned.

===Roads===
Mandalay literally is at the center of Burma's road network. The highway network includes roads towards:<ref name=md>{{cite news |url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Article/Article2005/Feb/Feb13.htm |title=Mandalay Division marching to new golden land of unity and amity |date=13 February 2005 |author=Thiha Aung |newspaper=[[New Light of Myanmar]]}}</ref>

* Lower Burma– [[Yangon-Mandalay Expressway]] and [[National Highway 1 (Burma)|AH1]]<ref name=AH/>

Most stretches of these highways are one-lane roads in poor condition.

===Buses and cars===

==Culture==
[[File:Buddha relics.JPG|thumb|right|Buddha relics from [[Kanishka stupa]] in [[Peshawar]], [[Pakistan]], now in Mandalay. Teresa Merrigan, 2005]]
Mandalay is Burma's cultural and religious center of Buddhism, having numerous monasteries and more than 700&nbsp;[[Burmese pagoda|pagodas]]. At the foot of [[Mandalay Hill]] sits the world's official "[[Tripiṭaka tablets at Kuthodaw Pagoda|Buddhist Bible]]", also known as the world's largest book, in [[Kuthodaw Pagoda]]. The styles of Mandalay Buddha Images and Buddha Statues were many since King Mandon, who was a devout Buddhist, and had filled Mandalay with them and through the years Mandalay Buddhist art became established as the pure art of Myanmar. There are 729&nbsp;slabs of stone that together are inscribed with the entire [[Pāli Canon]], each housed in its own white [[stupa]].
[[File:Mandalay, Palacio 02.jpg|thumb|The [[Mandalay Palace]]]]
The buildings inside the old Mandalay city walls, surrounded by a moat, which was repaired in recent times using prison labor, comprise the [[Mandalay Palace]], mostly destroyed during [[World War II]]. İt is now replaced by a replica, military Prison and a military garrison, the headquarters of the [[Myanmar Army|Central Military Command]].

===Media===
Much of the media in Mandalay – like elsewhere in Burma – comes from Yangon. The city's non-satellite [[TV programming]] comes from Yangon-based state-run [[TV Myanmar]] and military-run [[Myawaddy TV|Myawaddy]], both of which provide [[Burmese language]] news and entertainment. Since December 2006, [[MRTV]]-4, formerly a paid channel, has also been available in Mandalay.<ref name=fm>{{Cite news |title=Myanmar to launch 2nd FM radio station in northern city |url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90777/90851/6377348.html |date=20 March 2008 |publisher=[[People's Daily]] Online via [[Xinhua]]}}</ref> Mandalay has two radio stations. [[Naypyidaw]]-based [[Myanmar Radio National Service]] is the national radio service and broadcasts mostly in Burmese (and in English during specific times.)

==Sports==

Mandalay's sporting facilities are quite poor by international standards but are still the best in Upper Burma. The 17,000&nbsp;seat [[Bahtoo Stadium]] was the largest in Upper Myanmar before the construction of [[Mandalarthiri Stadium]] and hosts mainly local and regional association football and track-and-field tournaments. Since May 2009, professional football has arrived in Mandalay, with [[Yadanabon FC]] representing the city in the newly formed [[Myanmar National League]], the country's first professional football league.<ref name="mnl">{{Cite journal |url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no461/sport01.htm |title=New era for football |author=Han Oo Khin |date=9–15 March 2009 |journal=[[The Myanmar Times]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215122240/http://www.mmtimes.com/no461/sport01.htm |archive-date=15 February 2012}}</ref>

==Economy==

* [[Rudyard Kipling]] wrote a poem called "[[Mandalay (poem)|Mandalay]]" (1890), which is the origin of the phrase "on the road to Mandalay".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://raysweb.net/poems/mandalay/index.html |title=Mandalay Rudyard Kipling |access-date=25 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205040235/http://raysweb.net/poems/mandalay/index.html |archive-date=5 December 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1907, the poem was set to music by [[Oley Speaks]] as ''[[On the Road to Mandalay (song)|On the Road to Mandalay]]''. Speaks' version was widely recorded. Among the best known renditions is the one by [[Frank Sinatra]] on ''[[Come Fly with Me (Frank Sinatra album)|Come Fly With Me]]''.
* [[Bithia Mary Croker]] wrote a novel in 1917, ''The Road to Mandalay'', which was the uncredited basis for a 1926 American silent [[The Road to Mandalay (1926 film)|film]]. Of this, only excerpts survive. A further [[The Road to Mandalay (2016 film)|film of the same name]] was  directed by [[Midi Z]] in 2016.
* The large hotel/casino/convention center [[Mandalay Bay]] in [[Las Vegas]] is named for the city, despite the fact that the city is 500 kilometers from the nearest bay, perhaps in reference to the line in Kipling's poem, "An' the dawn comes up like thunder outer China 'crost the Bay! "
* [[George Orwell]] was stationed at Mandalay for a time while working for the [[Indian Imperial Police]] in Burma, and his first novel, ''[[Burmese Days]]'' (1934), was based on his experiences in Burma. He also wrote a number of short non-fiction essays and short stories about Burma, such as "[[A Hanging]]" (1931) and "[[Shooting an Elephant]]" (1936).
* [[John Masters]] wrote a book about his wartime experiences in Burma called ''The Road Past Mandalay'' (1961)..
* In the 1956 children's song "[[Nellie the Elephant]]", the road to Mandalay is the location for a rendezvous of the herd:
<blockquote>
:The head of the herd was calling far far away.
:They met one night in the silver light,
:On the road to Mandalay.</blockquote>
* The American film studio ''[[Mandalay Pictures]]'' is named after the city. The logo also features a tiger, which is often seen roaming around the city.
* British pop singer [[Robbie Williams]] sang a song called [[Eternity/The Road to Mandalay]] which was released as a single in 2001.
