'''Nkayi''', also known as N'kayi, is a town and a [[Communes of the Republic of the Congo|commune]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ins-congo.cg/download/chapitre-3-organisation-administrative/ |title=Annuaire Statistique du Congo 2018, chapitre 3 : organisation administrative |date=2021-03-23 |format=PDF |page=11 |publisher={{lang|fr|Institut National de la Statistique}} |website=ins-congo.cg |access-date=2023-08-18|language=fr }}</ref> in  the [[Bouenza|Bouenza Department]] of the [[Republic of the Congo]].  It is the country's fourth largest city with a population of 104,083 (2023 census).

It is divided into 2 urban boroughs (''arrondissements''):
# Mouana-Nto (Mouana Ntô)
# Soulouka

Nkayi is a major sugar production centre in the country.

== Transport ==

The city is served by a [[Train station|station]] on the national [[railway]] network, the [[Congo-Ocean Railway]].  It is home to [[Yokangassi Airport]], also known as Nkayi Airport.

== History ==

Situated in the fertile [[Niari Valley]], the town was named '''Jacob''' in 1887. That was the name of the French engineer who led the first mission to select the best route for the [[Congo-Ocean Railway]]. Then the city  began growing thanks to the thriving [[sugar cane]] plantations led by important [[agroindustry|agroindustries]]. In 1975, Jacob had a population of 25,000, and its name was changed to the native one of Nkayi.

The city is the fourth largest town in the Republic of the Congo since 1980.
