It is the [[capital city|capital]] and largest city of the province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]. Maastricht is located on both sides of the [[Meuse]] ({{langx|nl|Maas}}), at the point where the river is joined by the [[Jeker]]. [[Mount Saint Peter]] (''Sint-Pietersberg'') is largely situated within the city's municipal borders. Maastricht is adjacent to the border with [[Belgium]] and is part of the [[Meuse-Rhine Euroregion]], an international metropolis with a population of about 3.9 million, which includes the nearby German and Belgian cities of [[Aachen]], [[Liège]], and [[Hasselt]].

Maastricht developed from a [[Roman Republic|Roman]] settlement (''Trajectum ad Mosam'') to a medieval river trade and religious centre. In the 16th century it became a garrison town and in the 19th century an early industrial centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zichtopmaastricht.nl|title=Zicht op Maastricht|publisher=zichtopmaastricht.nl |access-date=19 August 2012}}</ref> Today, the city is a thriving cultural and regional hub.

=== Toponymy ===
Maastricht is mentioned in ancient documents as ''[Ad] Treiectinsem [urbem]'' ab. 575, ''Treiectensis'' in 634, ''Triecto'', ''Triectu'' in 7th century, ''Triiect'' in 768–781, ''Traiecto'' in 945, ''Masetrieth'' in 1051.<ref>As ''Treiectinsem urbem'', "the city of Trajectum", in [[Gregory of Tours]], [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/gregorytours/gregorytours2.shtml ''Historia Francorum'', 2, 5] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316175253/http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/gregorytours/gregorytours2.shtml |date=16 March 2015 }} (late 6th ct.).</ref><ref>M. Gysseling, ''Toponymisch Woordenboek van België, Nederland, Luxemburg, Noord-Frankrijk en West-Duitsland (vóór 1226)'' (Tongeren, 1960) [http://bouwstoffen.kantl.be/tw/facsimile/?find=maastricht p. 646].</ref>

The place name ''Maastricht'' is an [[Old Dutch]] compound ''Masa-'' (> ''Maas'' "the [[Meuse]] river") + Old Dutch ''*treiekt'', itself borrowed from Gallo-Romance <small>*TRA(I)ECTU</small> cf. its Walloon name ''li trek'', from Classical Latin ''trajectus'' ("[[Ford (crossing)|ford]], passage, place to cross a river") with the later addition of ''Maas'' "Meuse" to avoid the confusion with the ''-trecht'' of [[Utrecht]] having exactly the same original form and etymology. The Latin name first appears in medieval documents and it is not known whether ''{{lang|la|*Trajectu(s)}}'' was Maastricht's name during Roman times.

A resident of Maastricht is referred to as ''Maastrichtenaar'' whilst in the local dialect it is either ''Mestreechteneer'' or, colloquially, ''[[Sjeng (name)|Sjeng]]'' (derived from the formerly popular French name ''Jean'').

=== Early history ===
[[File:Maastricht - rijksmonument 527161 - Museumkelder Derlon 20100821.jpg|thumb|left|Roman sanctuary in the basement of Hotel Derlon]]
[[Neanderthal]] remains have been found to the west of Maastricht (Belvédère excavations). Of a later date are [[Palaeolithic]] remains, between 8,000 and 25,000 years old. [[Celts]] lived here around 500 BC, at a spot where the river [[Meuse]] was shallow and therefore easy to cross.

It is not known when the Romans arrived in Maastricht, nor whether the settlement was founded by them. The Romans built a bridge across the Meuse in the 1st century AD, during the reign of [[Augustus Caesar]]. The bridge was an important link in the main road between [[Bavay]] and [[Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium|Cologne]]. Roman Maastricht was relatively small. Remains of the Roman road, the bridge, a religious shrine, a [[Roman bath]], a [[granary]], some houses and the 4th-century [[castrum]] walls and gates, have been excavated. Fragments of provincial Roman sculptures, as well as coins, jewelry, glass, pottery and other objects from Roman Maastricht are on display in the exhibition space of the city's public library (''Centre Céramique'').

According to legend, the [[Armenia]]n-born [[Saint Servatius]], [[Bishopric of Tongeren|Bishop of Tongeren]], died in Maastricht in 384 where he was interred along the Roman road, outside the castrum. According to [[Gregory of Tours]] it was bishop [[Monulph]] who around 570 built the first stone church on the grave of Servatius, a precursor of the present-day [[Basilica of Saint Servatius]]. The city remained an early [[Christianity|Christian]] [[diocese]] until it lost the distinction to nearby [[Liège]] in the 8th or 9th century.

=== Middle Ages ===
In the early [[Middle Ages]] Maastricht, along with [[Aachen]] and [[Liège]], formed part of what is considered the heartland of the [[Carolingian dynasty]]. At this time, the town was an important centre for river trade and manufacturing. [[Merovingian]] coins minted in Maastricht have been found throughout Europe. In 881 the town was plundered by the [[Vikings]]. In the 10th century it briefly became the capital of the [[Lower Lorraine|duchy of Lower Lorraine]].

During the 11th and 12th centuries the town flourished culturally. Several [[Provost (religion)|provosts]] of the chapter of Saint Servatius held important positions in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The two [[collegiate church]]es were largely rebuilt and redecorated during this era. Maastricht [[Romanesque art#Sculpture|Romanesque stone sculpture]] and [[silversmithing]] are regarded as highlights of [[Mosan art]]. Maastricht painters were praised by [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] in his [[Parzival]]. Around the same time, the poet [[Henric van Veldeke]] wrote a legend of Saint Servatius, one of the earliest works in [[Dutch literature]]. The two main churches acquired a wealth of [[relic]]s and the septennial [[Pilgrimage of the Relics, Maastricht|Maastricht Pilgrimage]] became a major event that drew up to 100,000 pilgrims.

Unlike most Dutch towns, Maastricht did not receive [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] at a certain date. These gradually developed during its long history. In 1204 the city's [[condominium (international law)|dual authority]] was formalised in a treaty, with the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège|prince-bishop of Liège]] and the [[Duchy of Brabant|duke of Brabant]] holding joint sovereignty over the city. Soon afterwards the first ring of medieval walls were built. In 1275, the old Roman bridge collapsed under the weight of a procession, allegedly killing 400 people. A replacement bridge, funded by church [[indulgence]]s, was built slightly to the north and survives until today, the [[Sint Servaasbrug]].<ref>{{citation|title=Christendom and Christianity in the Middle Ages: The Relations Between Religion, Church, and Society|first=Adriaan H.|last=Bredero|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|year=1994|isbn=978-0-8028-4992-2|page=352|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CD-2apInJSYC&pg=PA352}}.</ref>

Throughout the Middle Ages, the city remained a centre for trade and manufacturing principally of [[wool]] and [[leather]] but gradually economic decline set in. After a brief period of economic prosperity around 1500, the city's economy suffered during the [[European wars of religion|wars of religion]] of the 16th and 17th centuries, and recovery did not happen until the [[industrial revolution]] in the early 19th century.

=== 16th to 18th centuries ===
[[File:1579 Siege of Maastricht - Aranjuez Palace.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Siege of Maastricht (1579)]] as depicted in the [[Palace of Aranjuez]]|200x200px]]
The strategic location of Maastricht at a major river crossing necessitated the construction of an array of fortifications around the city during this period. The Spanish and Dutch [[garrison]]s became an important factor in the city's economy. In 1579 the city was sacked by the Spanish army led by the [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]] ([[Siege of Maastricht (1579)|Siege of Maastricht, 1579]]). For over fifty years the Spanish crown took over the role previously held by the dukes of Brabant in the joint sovereignty over Maastricht. In 1632 [[Capture of Maastricht|the city was conquered]] by Prince [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange|Frederick Henry]] of [[Principality of Orange|Orange]] and the Dutch [[Netherlands States-General|States General]] replaced the Spanish crown in the joint government of Maastricht. There was an attempt in 1634 of Spanish forces to [[Siege of Maastricht (1634)|recapture the city]], but to no avail.

Another [[Siege of Maastricht (1673)]] took place during the [[Franco-Dutch War]]. In June 1673, [[Louis XIV of France#Early wars in the Low Countries|Louis XIV]] laid siege to the city because French supply lines were being threatened. During this siege, [[Vauban]], the famous French military engineer, developed a new tactic in order to break down the strong fortifications surrounding Maastricht. His systematic approach remained the standard method of attacking fortresses until the 20th century. On 25 June 1673, while preparing to storm the city, captain-lieutenant [[Charles de Batz de Castelmore]], also known as the ''comte [[d'Artagnan]]'', was killed by a musket shot outside the Tongerse Poort. This event was embellished in [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas']] novel ''[[The Vicomte de Bragelonne]]'', part of the [[D'Artagnan Romances]]. French troops occupied Maastricht from 1673 to 1678.

In 1748 the French again conquered the city at what is known as the [[Siege of Maastricht (1748)|Second French Siege of Maastricht]], during the [[War of Austrian Succession]]. After each siege the city's fortifications were restored and expanded. The French revolutionary army failed to take the city in 1793 but a year later they succeeded. The condominium was dissolved and Maastricht was annexed to the [[French First Republic]], later the [[First French Empire]]. For almost twenty years (1795–1814/15) Maastricht was the capital of the French [[Département in France#Napoleonic Empire|département]] of [[Meuse-Inférieure]].

=== 19th and early 20th century ===
[[File:Boschstraat Sphinx, 1865.jpg|thumb|19th-century industry: Maastricht potteries in Boschstraat]]
After the [[Napoleonic era]], Maastricht became part of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in 1815. It was made the capital of the newly formed [[Province of Limburg (1815–1839)]]. When the southern provinces of the newly formed kingdom [[Belgian Revolution|seceded in 1830]], the Dutch garrison in Maastricht remained loyal to the Dutch king, [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]], even when most of the inhabitants of the town and the surrounding area sided with the Belgian revolutionaries. In 1831, arbitration by the [[Great Powers]] allocated the city to the Netherlands. However, neither the Dutch nor the Belgians agreed to this and the arrangement was not implemented until the 1839 [[Treaty of London, 1839|Treaty of London]]. During this period of isolation Maastricht developed into an early industrial town.

[[File:Maastricht Liberation Plate, 14 Sept. 1944.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Plate commemorating the liberation, 14 September 1944]]
Because of its eccentric location in the southeastern Netherlands, as well as its geographical and cultural proximity to Belgium and Germany, integration of Maastricht and Limburg into the Netherlands did not come about easily. Maastricht retained a distinctly non-Dutch appearance during much of the 19th century and it was not until the [[First World War]] that the city was forced to look northwards.

Like the rest of the Netherlands, Maastricht remained neutral during World War I. However, being wedged between Germany and Belgium, it received large numbers of refugees, putting a strain on the city's resources. Early in [[World War II]], the city was taken by the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] by surprise during the [[Battle of Maastricht]] of May 1940. On 13 and 14 September 1944 it was the first Dutch city to be liberated by [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] of the US [[30th Infantry Division (United States)|Old Hickory Division]]. The three Meuse bridges were destroyed or severely damaged during the war. As elsewhere in the Netherlands, the majority of Maastricht [[Jews]] died in [[Nazi concentration camps]].<ref>About 77% of Maastricht's relatively small Jewish community of 505 members did not survive the war. {{aut|P.J.H. Ubachs & I.M.H. Evers}} (2005): ''Historische Encyclopedie Maastricht'', pp. 256-257. Walburg Pers, Zutphen. {{ISBN|90-5730-399-X}}.</ref>

=== After World War II ===

During the latter half of the century, traditional industries (such as Maastricht's [[pottery|potteries]]) declined and the city's economy shifted to a [[service economy]]. [[Maastricht University]] was founded in 1976. Several European institutions found their base in Maastricht. In 1981 and 1991 [[European Council]]s were held in Maastricht, the latter one resulting a year later in the signing of the [[Maastricht Treaty]], leading to the creation of the [[European Union]] and the [[euro]].<ref>Gnesotto, N. (1992). European union after Minsk and Maastricht. ''International Affairs''. 68(2), 223-232.</ref> Since 1988, [[The European Fine Art Fair]], regarded as the world's leading art fair, annually draws in some of the wealthiest art collectors.

Since the 1990s, large parts of the city have been refurbished, including the areas around the main railway station and the Maasboulevard [[promenade]] along the Meuse, the Entre Deux and Mosae Forum shopping centres, as well as some of the main shopping streets. A prestigious quarter designed by international architects and including the new [[Bonnefanten Museum]], a public library, and a theatre was built on the grounds of the former Société Céramique factory near the town centre. Further large-scale projects, such as the redevelopment of the area around the [[A2 motorway (Netherlands)|A2 motorway]], the Sphinx Quarter and the Belvédère area are under construction.

In the early 2000s, Maastricht launched several campaigns against drug-dealing in an attempt to stop foreign buyers taking advantage of the liberal Dutch legislation and causing trouble in the downtown area.<ref>{{cite web |author=<!-- Tekst: -->Maastricht Van onze verslaggever |url=http://www.limburger.nl/article/20080311/REGIONIEUWS06/803110348/1056 |title=Coffee Corner: Dagblad de Limburger |publisher=Limburger.nl |access-date=23 May 2012 |archive-date=31 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831232055/http://www.limburger.nl/article/20080311/REGIONIEUWS06/803110348/1056 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Border ===
Maastricht's [[city limits]] has an international border with Belgium. Most of it borders Belgium's [[Flanders|Flemish]] region, but a small part to the south also has a border with [[Wallonia]]. Both countries are part of Europe's [[Schengen Area]] and, thus, are open without border controls.

=== Climate ===
Maastricht features the same climate as most of the Netherlands (''Cfb'', [[Oceanic climate]]), however, due to its more inland location in between hills, summers tend to be warmer (especially in the Meuse valley, which lies {{cvt|70|m|disp=sqbr}} lower than the meteorological station) and winters a bit colder, although the difference is only noticeable on just a few days a year. The highest temperature recorded was on 25 July 2019 at {{convert|39.6|°C|1|abbr=on}}.

=== Languages ===
Maastricht is a city of linguistic diversity, partly as a result of its location at the crossroads of multiple language areas and its international student population.

* [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is the national language and the language of elementary and secondary education (excluding international institutions) as well as administration. Dutch in Maastricht is often spoken with a distinctive Limburgish [[Accent (dialect)|accent]], which should not be confused with the Limburgish language.
* [[Limburgish]] (or ''Limburgian'') is the overlapping term of the [[tonal languages|tonal]] dialects spoken in [[Limburg (Netherlands)|the Dutch]] and [[Limburg (Belgium)|the Belgian]] provinces of Limburg. The [[Maastrichtian dialect]] (''Mestreechs'') is only one of many variants of Limburgish. It is characterised by stretched [[vowel]]s and some French influence on its vocabulary. In recent years the Maastricht dialect has been in decline (see [[dialect levelling]]) and a language switch to Standard Dutch has been noted.<ref name="Dialect of Maastricht">{{cite web|title=The dialect of Maastricht |year=1999 |publisher=University of Nijmegen, Centre for Language Studies |url=http://www.let.kun.nl/gep/carlos/Maastrich2ipa.pdf |author1=Gussenhoven, C. |author2=Aarts, F. |name-list-style=amp |access-date=12 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612092141/http://www.let.kun.nl/gep/carlos/Maastrich2ipa.pdf |archive-date=12 June 2011 }}</ref>
* [[French language|French]] used to be the language of education and culture in Maastricht. In the late 18th century the language gained a powerful position as the judicial and administrative language, and throughout the following century it was the preferred language of the upper classes. Between 1851 and 1892 a Francophone newspaper (''Le Courrier de la Meuse'') was published in Maastricht.<ref name="Kessels-van der Heijde">{{cite book |title=Maastricht, Maestricht, Mestreech |last=Kessels-van der Heijde |first=Maria |year=2002 |publisher=Uitgeverij Verloren |location=Hilversum, Netherlands |isbn= 9065507132|pages=11–12 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NP3deKbb9QoC&q=maastricht+tussen+1813+en+1830&pg=PA5|access-date=11 February 2012}}</ref> The language is often part of secondary school curricula. Many proper names are French and the language has left many traces in the local dialect.
* [[German language|German]], like French, is often part of secondary school curricula. Due to Maastricht's geographic proximity to Germany and the great number of German students in the city, German is widely spoken.
* [[English language|English]] has become an important language in education. At [[Maastricht University]] and [[Hogeschool Zuyd]] it is the language of instruction for many courses. Many foreign students and [[expatriates]] use English as a [[lingua franca]]. English is also a mandatory subject in Dutch secondary schools.

=== Sights of Maastricht ===
Maastricht is known in the Netherlands and beyond for its lively squares, narrow streets, and historic buildings. The city has 1,677 national heritage buildings (''[[rijksmonument]]en''), more than any Dutch city outside Amsterdam. In addition to that there are 3,500 locally listed buildings (''gemeentelijke monumenten''). The entire city centre is a conservation area (''beschermd stadsgezicht'') and largely traffic-free. The tourist information office ([[Tourism in the Netherlands|VVV]]) is located in the basement of Dinghuis, a late-medieval courthouse overlooking Grote Staat.
Maastricht's main sights include:
* '''[[Meuse]] ({{langx|nl|Maas}}) river''', with several parks and promenades along the river, and some interesting bridges:
** [[Sint Servaasbrug]], partly from the 13th century; the oldest bridge in the Netherlands;
** [[Hoge Brug]] ("High Bridge"), a modern pedestrian bridge designed by René Greisch.
* '''City fortifications''', including:
** Remnants of the first and second medieval [[city wall]] and several towers (13th and 14th centuries);
** Helpoort ("Hell's Gate"), an imposing gate with two towers, built around 1230, the oldest city gate in the Netherlands;
** Wycker Waterpoort, a medieval gate in Wyck, used for accessing the city from the Meuse, demolished in the 19th century but rebuilt shortly afterwards;
** Hoge Fronten (or: Linie van Du Moulin), remnants of 17th and 18th-century [[fortifications]], including a number of well-preserved [[bastions]], [[couvreface]]s, [[Lunette (fortification)|lunettes]] and dry [[moat]]s;
** Fort Sint-Pieter, an early 18th-century [[fortress]] on the flanks of [[Mount Saint Peter]], offering guided tours and panoramic views of the city; and Fort Willem I, an early 19th-century fortress on the Caberg elevation;
** [[Casemate]]s, an underground network of tunnels, built as sheltered emplacements for guns and cannons. These connected tunnels built of brick and limestone run for around fourteen kilometres underneath the city's fortifications. Guided tours are available.
* '''Binnenstad''': inner-city pedestrianized district with popular shopping streets Grote and Kleine Staat, high-end shopping streets Stokstraat and Maastrichter Smedenstraat, and two indoor shopping centres. Several main sights in Maastricht as well as a large number of cafés, pubs and restaurants are centred around the three main squares in Binnenstad:
** [[Vrijthof]], the largest and possibly best-known square in Maastricht, with many well-known pubs and restaurants. Other sights include:
*** [[Basilica of Saint Servatius]], a predominantly Romanesque church with an imposing [[westwork]] and important 12th and 13th-century sculptures; most notably the westwork interior figurative [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], the westwork [[reredo]], and the sculpted South Portal.

The eastern riverbed between Pietersplas and the provincial government building is a nature reserve (Kleine Weerd).
* The Jeker Valley, along the river [[Jeker]], starts near the city centre in Stadspark and leads via Jekerpark to an area with green meadows, fertile fields, some vineyards on the slopes of Cannerberg, several water mills and [[Château Neercanne]], and continues further south into Belgium.

The municipal government of Maastricht consists of a [[city council]], a [[mayor]] and a number of [[aldermen]]. The city council, a 39-member legislative body directly [[2022 Dutch municipal elections|elected]] every four years, appoints the aldermen on the basis of a coalition agreement between two or more parties after each election.

=== Aldermen and mayors ===
The mayor and aldermen make up the executive branch of the municipal government. 

The mayor from 2002, [[Gerd Leers]] ([[Christian Democratic Appeal|CDA]]), resigned in January 2010 following allegations of irregularities in a holiday villa project in Bulgaria owned by Leers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Maastrichtse burgemeester Leers stapt op |url=http://www.nu.nl/politiek/2161977/maastrichtse-burgemeester-leers-stapt.html |newspaper=[[NU.nl]] |date=14 January 2010 |agency=[[Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau|ANP]] |language=nl |trans-title=Maastricht mayor Leers resigns}}</ref> He was replaced by [[Onno Hoes]], a Liberal ([[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]]), the only male mayor in the country officially married to a man. In 2013 Hoes was subject to controversy after disclosures of intimate affairs with several other men, although he remained mayor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/1021705/onno-hoes-mag-blijven|title=Onno Hoes mag blijven|date=19 December 2013|website=Telegraaf|access-date=3 January 2019|archive-date=3 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190103210455/https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/1021705/onno-hoes-mag-blijven|url-status=dead}}</ref> After a new affair in 2014, Hoes eventually stepped down.<ref>Grindstad, Ingrid.

=== Cannabis ===
One controversial issue which dominated Maastricht politics for many years was the city's approach to soft drugs. Under the [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|Dutch soft drug policy]], individuals may buy [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] from [[Cannabis coffee shop|'coffeeshops']] under certain conditions. From the 1980s, Maastricht saw a growing influx of '[[drug tourism|drug tourists]]', mainly from neighbouring Belgium, France and Germany. The city government attempted to reduce negative side effects, including illegal sale of hard drugs in the city centre and anti-social behaviour.
[[File:2018 Maastricht, Maaspromenade, coffeeshop boten 2.jpg|thumb|Two [[Cannabis coffee shop|'coffeeshop']] boats at Maasboulevard]]
A 2008 proposal to relocate the coffeeshops to the outskirts of the city<ref>{{cite news|first=Marlise |last=Simons |year=2018 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/world/cannabis-cafes-get-nudge-to-fringes-of-a-dutch-city.html |title=Cannabis Cafes Get Nudge to Fringes of a Dutch City|work=[[The New York Times]], 20 August 2006|accessdate=6 May 2024}}</ref> was opposed by neighbouring municipalities (some in Belgium) and by the Dutch and Belgian parliaments. In December 2010, a Maastricht law to restrict entry to coffeeshops to local residents was upheld by the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]],<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Court of Justice of the European Union |url=http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/gettext.pl?where=&lang=en&num=79898783C19090137&doc=T&ouvert=T&seance=ARRET |title=Marc Michel Josemans v.

The A2 motorway runs through Maastricht in a double-decked tunnel. Before 2016, the A2 motorway ran through the city; heavily congested, it caused air pollution in the urban area. Construction of a two-level tunnel designed to solve these problems started in 2011 and was opened (in stages) by December 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.a2maastricht.nl/page.aspx?id=334|title=A2maastricht.nl - Homepage A2 Maastricht|website=www.a2maastricht.nl|access-date=31 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503054342/http://www.a2maastricht.nl/page.aspx?id=334|archive-date=3 May 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In spite of several large underground car parks, parking in the city centre forms a major problem during weekends and bank holidays because of the large numbers of visitors. Parking fees are deliberately high to encourage visitors to use public transport or [[park and ride]] facilities away from the centre.

=== By train ===
Maastricht is served by three rail operators, all of which call at the main [[Maastricht railway station]] near the centre and two of which call at the smaller [[Maastricht Randwyck railway station|Maastricht Randwyck]], near the business and university district. Only Arriva also calls at [[Maastricht Noord railway station|Maastricht Noord]], which opened in 2013. Intercity trains northwards to [[Amsterdam]], [[Eindhoven]], [['s-Hertogenbosch|Den Bosch]] and [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] are operated by [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen|Dutch Railways]]. The line to [[Heerlen]], [[Valkenburg aan de Geul|Valkenburg]] and [[Kerkrade]] is operated by [[Arriva]]. The [[National Railway Company of Belgium]] runs south to [[Liège]] in [[Belgium]]. The westbound railway to [[Hasselt]] (Belgium) closed in 1954. The former railway to [[Aachen]] was closed down in the 1980s. However, Aachen can still be reached via Heerlen.

=== By bus ===
Regular bus lines connect the city centre, outer areas, business districts and railway stations. The regional [[Arriva#Netherlands|Arriva]] bus network extends to most parts of [[South Limburg (Netherlands)|South Limburg]] and [[Aachen]] (Germany). Regional buses by [[De Lijn]] connect Maastricht with [[Hasselt]], [[Tongeren]] and [[Maasmechelen]], and one bus connects Maastricht with [[Liège]], operated by [[Société Régionale Wallonne du Transport|TEC]]. Various bus companies such as [[Flixbus]] and [[Eurolines]] provide [[intercity bus service]]s from Maastricht to many European destinations.

=== By air ===
Maastricht is served by the nearby [[Maastricht Aachen Airport]] {{airport codes|MST|EHBK}}, in nearby [[Beek]], and it is informally referred to by that name. The airport is located about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} north of the city centre. The airport is served by [[Corendon Dutch Airlines]] and [[Ryanair]] which operate scheduled flights to destinations around the Mediterranean, the Canary Islands, North-Africa and also [[London Stansted Airport]] from March 2022. There are also charter flights to [[Lourdes]] which are operated by [[Enter Air]].

=== By boat ===
Maastricht has a river [[port]] (''Beatrixhaven'') and is connected by water with [[Belgium]] and the rest of the Netherlands through the river [[Meuse]], the [[Juliana Canal]], the [[Albert Canal]] and the [[Zuid-Willemsvaart]]. Although there are no regular boat connections to other cities, various organized boat trips for tourists connect Maastricht with Belgium cities such as [[Liège]].

=== Distances to other cities ===
These distances are [[as the crow flies]] and so do not represent actual overland distances.

== Local anthem ==
In 2002 the municipal government officially adopted a local anthem ([[Limburgish]] ([[Maastrichtian dialect|Maastrichtian variant]]): ''Mestreechs Volksleed'', {{langx|nl|Maastrichts Volkslied}}) composed of lyrics in [[Maastrichtian dialect|Maastrichtian]], written by [[Alphonse Olterdissen|Alfons Olterdissen]]. The theme was originally composed by his brother, Guus Olterdissen, though the theme is similar to the theme "[[Pe-al nostru steag e scris Unire|Pe al nostru steag e scris Unire]]" of the Romanian composer [[Ciprian Porumbescu]] (1853–1883). It is unknown if the Olterdissen brothers were aware of the Romanian piece.<ref name="Municipality of Maastricht">{{cite web |title=Municipality of Maastricht: Maastrichts Volkslied|year=2008 |publisher=N.A.
