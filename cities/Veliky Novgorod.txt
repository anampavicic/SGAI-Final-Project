The [[Sofia First Chronicle]] makes initial mention of it in 859, while the [[Novgorod First Chronicle]] first mentions it in 862, when it was purportedly already a major [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]-to-[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]] station on the trade [[route from the Varangians to the Greeks]].<ref name="Tikhomirov">{{cite web |url=http://historic.ru/books/item/f00/s00/z0000082/st003.shtml |script-title=ru:Древнерусские города |last=Тихомиров |first=М.Н. |year=1956 |publisher=Государственное издательство Политической литературы |language=ru |access-date=June 13, 2012 }}</ref> The Charter of Veliky Novgorod recognizes 859 as the year when the city was first mentioned.<ref name="Established">Charter of Veliky Novgorod, Article 1.</ref> Novgorod is traditionally considered to be a cradle of Russian statehood.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ketola |first1=Kari |last2=Vihavainen |first2=Timo |title=Changing Russia? : history, culture and business |date=2014 |publisher=Finemor |location=Helsinki |isbn=978-952712401-7 |page=1 |edition=1st}}</ref>

The oldest archaeological excavations in the middle to late 20th century, however, have found cultural layers dating back to the late 10th century, the time of the [[Christianization of Rus']] and a century after it was allegedly founded.<ref>Valentin Lavrentyevich Ianin and Mark Khaimovich Aleshkovsky. "Proskhozhdeniye Novgoroda: (k postanovke problemy)," ''Istoriya SSSR'' 2 (1971): 32-61.</ref> Archaeological dating is fairly easy and accurate to within 15–25 years, as the streets were paved with wood, and most of the houses made of wood, allowing [[dendrochronology|tree ring dating]].{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

The [[Varangian]] name of the city {{lang |da|Holmgård}} or {{lang |da|Holmgard}} ({{lang |non|Holmgarðr}} or {{lang|non|Holmgarðir}}) is mentioned in [[Norse Saga]]s as existing at a yet earlier stage, but the correlation of this reference with the actual city is uncertain.<ref>The name {{lang |da|Holmgard}} is a Norse [[toponymy|toponym]] meaning ''[[Islet]] town'' or ''Islet [[grad (Slavic settlement)|grad]]'', and there are various explanations for why they gave this name. According to Rydzevskaya, the Norse name is derived from the Slavic {{lang|sla-RU|Holmgrad}} which means "town on a hill" and may allude to the "old town" preceding the "new town", or Novgorod.</ref> Originally, {{lang|da|Holmgård}} referred to the stronghold, now only {{convert |2|km|abbr=in}} to the south of the center of the present-day city, [[Rurikovo Gorodische]] (named in comparatively modern times after the Varangian chieftain [[Rurik]], who supposedly made it his "capital" around 860). Archaeological data suggests that the Gorodishche, the residence of the [[knyaz]] (prince), dates from the mid-9th century,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vnovgorod.info/gorod.html |script-title=ru:Городище |publisher=Великий Новгород |language=ru |access-date=March 27, 2013 |title=Vnovgorod.info }}</ref> whereas the town itself dates only from the end of the 10th century; hence the name Novgorod, "new city", from [[Old East Slavic]] {{lang|orv|новъ}} and {{lang|orv|городъ}} ({{lang|cu-Latn|nov}} and {{lang|cu-Latn|gorod}}); the Old Norse term {{lang|non|Nýgarðr}} is a [[calque]] of an [[Old Russian]] word. First mention of this Norse etymology to the name of the city of Novgorod (and that of other cities within the territory of the then [[Kievan Rus']]) occurs in the 10th-century policy manual {{lang|la-TR|[[De Administrando Imperio]]|italic=yes}} by [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Constantine VII]].{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

In 882, Rurik's successor, [[Oleg of Novgorod]], conquered [[Kiev]] and founded the state of [[Kievan Rus']]. Novgorod's size as well as its political, economic, and cultural influence made it the second most important city in Kievan Rus'. According to a custom, the elder son and heir of the ruling Kievan monarch was sent to rule Novgorod even as a minor. When the ruling monarch had no such son, Novgorod was governed by [[posadnik]]s, such as the legendary [[Gostomysl]], [[Dobrynya]], [[Konstantin Dobrynich|Konstantin]], and [[Ostromir]].{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

[[Yaroslav I the Wise|Yaroslav the Wise]] was Prince of Novgorod from 1010 to 1019, while his father, [[Vladimir the Great]], was a prince in Kiev. Yaroslav promulgated the first written code of laws (later incorporated into [[Russkaya Pravda]]) among the Eastern Slavs and is said to have granted the city a number of freedoms or privileges, which they often referred to in later centuries as precedents in their relations with other princes. His son, [[Vladimir of Novgorod]], sponsored construction of the great [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod|Saint Sophia Cathedral]], more accurately translated as the Cathedral of Holy Wisdom, which stands to this day.

The [[Gotland]] town of [[Visby]] functioned as the leading trading center in the Baltic before the [[Hansa League]].

===Novgorod Republic===
{{Main|Novgorod Republic}}

[[File:Unknow - The Angel with Golden Hair - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|12th-century Novgorod icon called ''[[The Angel with Golden Hair]]'']]
In 1136, the Novgorodians dismissed their prince [[Vsevolod Mstislavich of Novgorod and Pskov|Vsevolod Mstislavich]]. The year is seen as the traditional beginning of the [[Novgorod Republic]]. The city was able to invite and dismiss a number of princes over the next two centuries, but the princely office was never abolished and powerful princes, such as [[Alexander Nevsky]], could assert their will in the city regardless of what Novgorodians said.<ref>Michael C. Paul, "The Iaroslavichi and the Novgorodian Veche 1230–1270: A Case Study on Princely Relations with the Veche", ''Russian History/ Histoire Russe'' 31, No. 1-2 (Spring-Summer 2004): 39-59.</ref> The [[city state]] controlled most of Europe's northeast, from lands east of today's [[Estonia]] to the [[Ural Mountains]], making it one of the largest states in medieval Europe, although much of the territory north and east of Lakes [[Lake Ladoga|Ladoga]] and [[Lake Onega|Onega]] was sparsely populated and never organized politically.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

One of the most important local figures in Novgorod was the {{transliteration|sla|[[posadnik]]}}, or mayor, an official elected by the public assembly (called the {{transliteration|sla|[[Novgorod veche|Veche]]}}) from among the city's [[boyars]], or aristocracy. The {{transliteration|sla|[[tysyatsky]]}}, or "thousandman", originally the head of the town militia but later a commercial and judicial official, was also elected by the {{transliteration|sla|Veche}}. Another important local official was the [[Archbishop of Novgorod]] who shared power with the boyars.<ref>Michael C. Paul, "Secular Power and the Archbishops of Novgorod Before the Muscovite Conquest". ''Kritika: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History'' 8, no. 2 (Spring 2007): 231-270.</ref> Archbishops were elected by the {{transliteration|sla|Veche}} or [[sortition|by the drawing of lots]], and after their election, were sent to the [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] for consecration.<ref>Michael C. Paul, "Episcopal Election in Novgorod, Russia 1156–1478". ''Church History: Studies in Christianity and Culture'' 72, No. 2 (June 2003): 251-275.</ref>

While a basic outline of the various officials and the {{transliteration|sla|Veche}} can be drawn up, the city-state's exact political constitution remains unknown. The boyars and the archbishop ruled the city together, although where one official's power ended and another's began is uncertain. The prince, although his power was reduced from around the middle of the 12th century, was represented by his {{transliteration|sla|[[namestnik]]}}, or lieutenant, and still played important roles as a military commander, legislator and jurist. The exact composition of the {{transliteration|sla|Veche}}, too, is uncertain, with some historians, such as [[Vasily Klyuchevsky]], claiming it was democratic in nature, while later scholars, such as [[Marxist historiography|Marxists]] Valentin Ianin and Aleksandr Khoroshev, see it as a "sham democracy" controlled by the ruling elite.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

In the 13th century, Novgorod, while not a member of the [[Hanseatic League]], was the easternmost [[kontor]], or [[entrepôt]], of the league, being the source of enormous quantities of luxury ([[sable]], [[Stoat|ermine]], [[fox]], [[marmot]]) and non-luxury furs (squirrel pelts).<ref>Janet Martin, ''Treasure of the Land of Darkness: the Fur Trade and its Significance for Medieval Russia''. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985).</ref>

Throughout the Middle Ages, the city thrived culturally. A large number of [[birch bark document|birch bark letters]] have been unearthed in excavations, perhaps suggesting widespread literacy. It was in Novgorod that the [[Novgorod Codex]], the oldest Slavic book written north of Bulgaria, and the oldest inscription in a Finnic language ([[Birch bark letter no. 292]]) were unearthed. Some of the most ancient Russian chronicles ([[Novgorod First Chronicle]]) were written in the scriptorium of the archbishops who also promoted iconography and patronized church construction. The Novgorod merchant [[Sadko]] became a popular hero of Russian [[folklore]].{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

Novgorod was never conquered by the Mongols during the [[Mongol invasion of Rus]]. The Mongol army turned back about {{convert|200|km|sp=us}} from the city, not because of the city's strength, but probably because the Mongol commanders did not want to get bogged down in the marshlands surrounding the city. However, the grand princes of Moscow, who acted as tax collectors for the khans of the Golden Horde, did collect tribute in Novgorod, most notably [[Yury of Moscow|Yury Danilovich]] and his brother, [[Ivan Kalita]].{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}
[[File:Vision of Tarasius.jpg|thumb|The 16th century Vision of Tarasius icon depicts Novgorod with the Sofia side to the left and the Commercial side to the right. The inhabitants of the city are shown doing their day-to-day work while being guarded by the angels]]
In 1259, [[Golden Horde|Mongol]] tax-collectors and census-takers arrived in the city, leading to political disturbances and forcing [[Alexander Nevsky]] to punish a number of town officials (he [[nose amputation|cut off their noses]]) for defying him as [[Vladimir-Suzdal|Grand Prince of Vladimir]] (soon to be the khan's tax-collector in Russia) and his Mongol overlords. In the 14th century, raids by Novgorod [[pirate]]s, or {{transliteration|sla|[[ushkuiniki]]}},<ref>Janet Martin, “Les Uškujniki de Novgorod: Marchands ou Pirates.” ''Cahiers du Monde Russe et Sovietique'' 16 (1975): 5-18.</ref> sowed fear as far as [[Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan]], assisting Novgorod in wars with the Grand Duchy of Moscow.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

During the era of [[Kievan Rus'|Old Rus' State]], Novgorod was a [[Foreign trade of medieval Novgorod|major trade hub]] at the northern end of both the [[Volga trade route]] and the "[[Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks|route from the Varangians to the Greeks]]" along the [[Dnieper river]] system. A vast array of goods were transported along these routes and exchanged with local Novgorod merchants and other traders. The farmers of [[Gotland]] retained the Saint Olof trading house well into the 12th century. Later German merchantmen also established tradinghouses in Novgorod. Scandinavian royalty would intermarry with Russian princes and princesses.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

After the [[East–West Schism|great schism]], Novgorod struggled from the beginning of the 13th century against [[Sweden|Swedish]], [[Denmark|Danish]], and German crusaders. During the [[Swedish-Novgorodian Wars]], the Swedes invaded lands where some of the population had earlier [[Novgorodian raids into Finland|paid tribute]] to Novgorod. The Germans had been trying to conquer the [[Baltic region]] since the late 12th century. Novgorod went to war 26 times with Sweden and 11 times with the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]]. The German [[knight]]s, along with Danish and Swedish feudal lords, launched a series of uncoordinated attacks between 1240 and 1242. Novgorodian sources mention that a Swedish army was defeated in the [[Battle of the Neva]] in 1240. The Baltic German campaigns ended in failure after the [[Battle on Lake Peipus|Battle on the Ice]] in 1242. After the foundation of the castle of [[Vyborg|Viborg]] in 1293 the Swedes gained a foothold in [[Karelia]]. On 12 August 1323, Sweden and Novgorod signed the [[Treaty of Nöteborg]], regulating their border for the first time.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

In the 15th century, Novgorod faced significant struggles with [[Famine|food scarcity]], which lasted for a decade in the mid-15th century.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ljungqvist |first=Fredrik Charpentier |last2=Seim |first2=Andrea |last3=Huhtamaa |first3=Heli |date=19 November 2020 |title=Climate and society in European history |url=https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.691 |journal=WIREs Climate Change |language=en |volume=12 |issue=2 |doi=10.1002/wcc.691 |issn=1757-7780}}</ref> This scarcity had profound implications for the population and the city's stability during that time, including its downfall. Novgorod was a hub for trade, attracting German merchants in substantial numbers, around 200 German merchants resided in the trade city in the 1430s, comprising about 1% of the total population of Novgorod at that time.<ref>{{Citation |last=Lukin |first=Pavel V. |title=German Merchants in Novgorod: Hospitality and Hostility, Twelfth–Fifteenth Centuries |date=2022 |work=Baltic Hospitality from the Middle Ages to the Twentieth Century: Receiving Strangers in Northeastern Europe |pages=117–142 |editor-last=Nauman |editor-first=Sari |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-98527-1_5 |access-date=2024-05-15 |place=Cham |publisher=Springer International Publishing |language=en |doi=10.1007/978-3-030-98527-1_5 |isbn=978-3-030-98527-1 |editor2-last=Jezierski |editor2-first=Wojtek |editor3-last=Reimann |editor3-first=Christina |editor4-last=Runefelt |editor4-first=Leif|doi-access=free }}</ref> The interactions between these merchants and the local population contributed to the nature of Novgorod during that time, influencing its economic prosperity and cultural diversity.

The city's downfall occurred partially as a result of its inability to feed its large population, making it dependent on the [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] region for grain. The main cities in the area, [[Moscow]] and [[Tver]], used this dependence to gain control over Novgorod.

At the time of annexation, Novgorod became the third largest city under [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovy]] and then the [[Tsardom of Russia]] (with 5,300 homesteads and 25–30&nbsp;thousand inhabitants in the 1550s)<ref>Boris Zemtsov, [http://www.ecsocman.edu.ru/images/pubs/2005/02/02/0000203630/006_zemtsov_2.pdf Откуда есть пошла... российская цивилизация], Общественные науки и современность. 1994. № 4.

In the Massacre, [[Ivan the Terrible]] sacked the city, slaughtered thousands of its inhabitants, and deported the city's merchant elite and nobility to Moscow, [[Yaroslavl]] and elsewhere. The last decade of the 16th century was a comparatively favourable period for the city as [[Boris Godunov]] restored trade privileges and raised the status of Novgorod bishop.

During the [[Time of Troubles]], Novgorodians submitted to [[Sweden|Swedish]] troops led by [[Jacob De la Gardie]] in the summer of 1611. The city was restituted to Muscovy six years later by the [[Treaty of Stolbovo]]. The conflict led to further depopulation: the number of homesteads in the city decreased from 1158 in 1607 to only 493 in 1617, with the Sofia side described as 'deserted'.<ref>{{cite book |title=Kotilaine |first=Russia's Foreign Trade and Economic Expansion in the Seventeenth Century: Windows on the World |last=J.T. |publisher=Brill |year=2005 |isbn=9789004138964 |pages=30}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Варенцов |first1=В.

===Russian Empire===
In 1727, Novgorod was made the administrative center of [[Novgorod Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]], which was detached from [[Saint Petersburg Governorate]] (see [[Administrative divisions of Russia in 1727–1728]]). This administrative division existed until 1927. Between 1927 and 1944, the city was a part of [[Leningrad Oblast]], and then became the administrative center of the newly formed [[Novgorod Oblast]].{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

===Modern era===
On 15 August&nbsp;1941, during [[World War II]], the city was occupied by the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]]. Its historic monuments were systematically obliterated. The [[Red Army]] [[Leningrad–Novgorod Offensive#Novgorod–Luga Offensive : 14 January – 15 February 1944|liberated]] the city on 19 January&nbsp;1944. Out of 2,536 stone buildings, fewer than forty remained standing. After the war, thanks to plans laid down by [[Alexey Shchusev]], the central part was gradually restored. In 1992, the chief monuments of the city and the surrounding area were inscribed on the UNESCO [[World Heritage Sites|World Heritage Site]] list as the [[Historic Monuments of Novgorod and Surroundings]]. As of 2020, regular archeological rescue work continues across the site.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Vdovichenko |first=Marina |date=2020-02-28 |title=Medieval Churches in Novgorod: Aspects of archaeological investigations and museum presentation |url=http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue54/10/index.html |journal=Internet Archaeology |language=en |issue=54 |doi=10.11141/ia.54.10 |s2cid=213325311 |issn=1363-5387 |doi-access=free }}</ref> In 1999, the city was officially renamed Veliky Novgorod (literally 'Great Novgorod'),<ref name=":0">{{cite web |url=http://kremlin.ru/acts/bank/13965 |title=Федеральный закон от 11.06.1999 г. № 111-ФЗ |website=kremlin.ru}}</ref> thus partly reverting to its medieval title "Lord Novgorod the Great". This reduced the temptation to confuse Veliky Novgorod with [[Nizhny Novgorod]], a larger city the other side of Moscow which, between 1932 and 1990, had been renamed Gorky, in honour of [[Maxim Gorky]].{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}


==Administrative and municipal status==
Veliky Novgorod is the [[administrative center]] of the [[oblast]] and, within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it also serves as the administrative center of [[Novgorodsky District]], even though it is not a part of it.<ref name="Ref534">Law #559-OZ</ref> As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the '''[[city of federal subject significance|city of oblast significance]] of Veliky Novgorod'''—an administrative unit with status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Novgorod Oblast|districts]].<ref name="Ref534" /> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the city of oblast significance of Veliky Novgorod is incorporated as '''Veliky Novgorod Urban Okrug'''.<ref name="Ref832">Oblast Law #284-OZ</ref>

The city is known for the variety and age of its medieval monuments. The foremost among these is the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod|Saint Sophia Cathedral]], built between 1045 and 1050 under the patronage of Vladimir Yaroslavich, the son of [[Yaroslav the Wise]]; Vladimir and his mother, [[Anna Porphyrogenita]], are buried in the cathedral.<ref>Tatiana Tsarevskaia, ''St. Sophia's Cathedral in Novgorod'' (Moscow: Severnyi Palomnik, 2005), 3.</ref> It is one of the best preserved churches from the 11th century. It is also probably the oldest structure still in use in Russia and the first one to represent original features of Russian architecture (austere stone walls, five helmet-like domes). Its frescoes were painted in the 12th century originally on the orders of Bishop Nikita (died 1108) (the "porches" or side chapels were painted in 1144 under [[Nifont of Novgorod|Archbishop Nifont]]) and renovated several times over the centuries, most recently in the nineteenth century.<ref>Tsarevskaia, 14, 19-22, 24, 29, 35.</ref> The cathedral features famous bronze gates, which now hang in the west entrance, allegedly made in [[Magdeburg]] in 1156 (other sources see them originating from [[Płock]] in [[Poland]]) and reportedly snatched by Novgorodians from the Swedish town of [[Sigtuna]] in 1187. More recent scholarship has determined that the gates were most likely purchased in the mid-15th century, apparently at the behest of Archbishop [[Euthymius II of Novgorod|Euthymius II]] (1429–1458), a lover of Western art and architectural styles.<ref>Jadwiga Irena Daniec, ''The Message of Faith and Symbol in European Medieval Bronze Church Doors'' (Danbury, CT: Rutledge Books, 1999), Chapter III "An Enigma: The Medieval Bronze Church Door of Płock in the Cathedral of Novgorod," 67-97; Mikhail Tsapenko, ed., ''Early Russian Architecture'' (Moscow: Progress Publisher, 1969), 34-38

The [[Novgorod Kremlin]], traditionally known as the ''Detinets'', also contains the oldest palace in Russia (the so-called Chamber of the Facets, 1433), which served as the main meeting hall of the archbishops; the oldest Russian bell tower (mid-15th century), and the oldest Russian clock tower (1673). The Palace of Facets, the bell tower, and the clock tower were originally built on the orders of Archbishop Euphimius II, although the clock tower collapsed in the 17th century and had to be rebuilt and much of the palace of Euphimius II is no longer standing. Among later structures, the most remarkable are a royal palace (1771) and a bronze monument to the [[Millennium of Russia]], representing the most important figures from the country's history (unveiled in 1862).
[[File:St. Nicholas Cathedral, Novgorod.JPG|thumb|left|[[Saint Nicholas Cathedral, Novgorod|St.&nbsp;Nicholas Cathedral]], built by Mstislav&nbsp;I near his palace at [[Yaroslav's Court]], Novgorod, contains 12th-century [[fresco]]es depicting his illustrious family]]

Outside the Kremlin walls, there are three large churches constructed during the reign of [[Mstislav I of Kiev|Mstislav the Great]]. [[Saint Nicholas Cathedral, Novgorod|St.&nbsp;Nicholas Cathedral]] (1113–1123), containing frescoes of Mstislav's family, graces [[Yaroslav's Court]] (formerly the chief square of Novgorod). The [[Yuriev Monastery]] (one of the oldest in Russia, 1030) contains a tall, three-domed cathedral from 1119 (built by Mstislav's son, [[Vsevolod of Pskov|Vsevolod]], and Kyurik, the head of the monastery). A similar three-domed cathedral (1117), probably designed by the same masters, stands in the [[Antoniev Monastery]], built on the orders of [[Anthony of Rome|Antony]], the founder of that monastery.

There are now some fifty medieval and early modern churches scattered throughout the city and its surrounding areas.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vdovichenko |first1=Marina  |date=2020 |title=Medieval Churches in Novgorod: Aspects of archaeological investigations and museum presentation |url=https://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue54/10/index.html |journal=Internet Archaeology |issue=54 |doi=10.11141/ia.54.10 |doi-access=free}}</ref> Some of them were blown up by the Nazis and subsequently restored. The most ancient pattern is represented by those dedicated to [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul|Saints Pyotr and Pavel]] (on the Swallow's Hill, 1185–1192), to Annunciation (in Myachino, 1179), to Assumption (on [[Volotovo Church|Volotovo Field]], 1180s) and to St.&nbsp;Paraskeva-Piatnitsa (at [[Yaroslav's Court]], 1207). The greatest masterpiece of early Novgorod architecture is the [[Nereditsa Church|Savior church at Nereditsa]] (1198).

In the 13th century, tiny churches of the three-paddled design were in vogue. These are represented by a small chapel at the [[Peryn Chapel|Peryn Monastery]] (1230s) and St.&nbsp;Nicholas' on the Lipnya Islet (1292, also notable for its 14th-century frescoes). The next century saw the development of two original church designs, one of them culminating in [[:ru:Церковь Фёдора Стратилата на Ручью|St Theodor's church]] (1360–1361, fine frescoes from 1380s), and another one leading to the [[Church of the Transfiguration on Ilyina Street|Savior church on Ilyina street]] (1374, painted in 1378 by [[Feofan Grek]]). The [[Transfiguration Church in Kovalyovo|Savior' church in Kovalevo]] (1345) was originally frescoed by [[Serbia]]n masters, but the church was destroyed during the war. While the church has since been rebuilt, the frescoes have not been restored.

During the last century of the republican government, some new churches were consecrated to Saints&nbsp;Peter and Paul (on Slavna, 1367; in Kozhevniki, 1406), to Christ's Nativity (at the Cemetery, 1387), to [[John the Apostle|St.&nbsp;John the Apostle's]] (1384), to the Twelve Apostles (1455), to St Demetrius (1467), to St.&nbsp;Simeon (1462), and other saints. Generally, they are not thought{{by whom|date=June 2018}} to be as innovative as the churches from the previous period. Several shrines from the 12th century (i.e., in Opoki) were demolished brick by brick and then reconstructed exactly as they used to be, several of them in the mid-fifteenth century, again under Archbishop Yevfimy&nbsp;II (Euthymius II), perhaps one of the greatest patrons of architecture in medieval Novgorod.

Novgorod's conquest by [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan&nbsp;III]] in 1478 decisively changed the character of local architecture. Large commissions were thenceforth executed by Muscovite masters and patterned after cathedrals of [[Moscow Kremlin]]: e.g., the Savior Cathedral of [[Khutyn Monastery]] (1515), the Cathedral of the Mother of God of the Sign (1688), the St. Nicholas Cathedral of Vyaschizhy Monastery (1685). Nevertheless, the styles of some parochial churches were still in keeping with local traditions: e.g., the churches of Myrrh-bearing Women (1510) and of Saints&nbsp;[[Boris and Gleb]] (1586).

In Vitoslavlitsy, along the [[Volkhov River]] and the [[Myachino Lake]], close to the [[Yuriev Monastery]], a museum of wooden architecture was established in 1964. Over twenty wooden buildings (churches, houses and mills) dating from the 14th to the 19th century were transported there from all around the Novgorod region.

11,400 graves of the German [[1st Luftwaffe Field Division]] are found at the war cemetery in Novgorod, and 1,900 soldiers of the Spanish [[Blue Division]] are buried there.<ref>[https://kriegsgraeberstaetten.volksbund.de/friedhof/nowgorod de:Kriegsgräberstätte Nowgorod]</ref>

==Transportation==
===Intercity transport===
[[File:Novgorod - Main railstation.jpg|thumb|Novgorod main railway station, built in 1953]]

Novgorod has connections to [[Moscow]] (531&nbsp;km) and [[Saint Petersburg|St.&nbsp;Petersburg]] (189&nbsp;km) by the [[Russian Route M10|federal highway M10]]. There are public buses to [[Saint Petersburg]] and other destinations.

The city has direct railway passenger connections with [[Moscow]] ([[Leningradsky Rail Terminal]], by night trains), [[St. Petersburg]] ([[Moskovsky Rail Terminal (Saint Petersburg)|Moscow Rail Terminal]] and [[Vitebsk Rail Terminal]], by [[suburban train]]s), [[Minsk]] ([[Belarus]]) ([[Minsk Passazhirsky railway station]], by night trains) and [[Murmansk]].

The city's former commercial airport [[Yurievo Airport|Yurievo]] was decommissioned in 2006, and the area has now been redeveloped into a residential neighbourhood. The still existing [[Krechevitsy Airport]] does not serve any regular flights since mid-1990s although there is a plan to turn [[Krechevitsy Airport|Krechevitsy]] into a new operational airport by 2025.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gpvn.ru/news/11150|title=Аэропорт Кречевицы начнёт работать в 2025 году|date=September 4, 2019}}</ref> The nearest international airport is St.&nbsp;Petersburg's [[Pulkovo Airport|Pulkovo]], some {{convert|180|km|0|abbr=off}} north of the city.

===Local transportation===
