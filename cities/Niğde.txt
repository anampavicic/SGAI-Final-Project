Niğde is located near a number of ancient trade routes, particularly the road from [[Kayseri]] (ancient [[Caesarea (Mazaca)|Caesarea Mazaca]]) to the [[Cilician Gates]] and thence to the Mediterranean coast. The area has been settled by [[Hittites]], [[ancient Assyrians|Assyrians]], [[Greeks]], [[Armenians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantines]] and  [[Turkic peoples|Turks]]. In the early [[Middle Ages]], it was known as Magida ({{langx|el|Μαγίδα}}), and was settled by the remaining inhabitants of nearby [[Tyana]] after it [[Siege of Tyana|fell to the Arabs]] in 708/709.

By the early 13th century Niğde was one of the largest cities in [[Anatolia]]. After the fall of the [[Sultanate of Rûm]] (of which it had been one of the principal cities), Niğde was captured by [[Anatolian beyliks]] such as the [[Karaman Beylik]] and [[Eretna Beylik]]. Passing through in the 14th century, the explorer [[Ibn Battuta]] reported it ruinous. It did not pass into Ottoman hands until 1467.
