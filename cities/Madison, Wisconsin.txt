===Founding===
Madison's modern origins begin in 1829, when former federal judge [[James Duane Doty]] purchased over a thousand acres (4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of swamp and forest land on the isthmus between Lakes Mendota and Monona, with the intention of building a city in the Four Lakes region. He purchased 1,261 acres for $1,500. When the [[Wisconsin Territory]] was created in 1836 the territorial legislature convened in [[Belmont, Wisconsin]]. One of the legislature's tasks was to select a permanent location for the territory's capital. Doty lobbied aggressively for Madison as the new capital, offering [[American bison|buffalo]] robes to the freezing legislators and choice lots in Madison at discount prices to undecided voters.<ref>Mollenhoff, David V.

The cornerstone for the [[Wisconsin State Capitol|Wisconsin capitol]] was laid in 1837, and the legislature first met there in 1838. On October 9, 1839, [[Kintzing Prichett]] registered the [[plat]] of Madison at the registrar's office of the then-territorial [[Dane County]].<ref name="platted1839">{{Cite book |title=Reports of cases argued and determined in the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin |publisher=E.E.

When Wisconsin became a state in 1848, Madison remained the capital, and the following year it became the site of the University of Wisconsin (now [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]). The [[Milwaukee & Mississippi Railroad]] (a predecessor of the [[Milwaukee Road]]) connected to Madison in 1854.

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Madison served as a center of the [[Union Army]] in Wisconsin. The intersection of Milwaukee, East Washington, Winnebago, and North Streets is known as Union Corners because a tavern there was the last stop for Union soldiers before heading to fight the Confederates. [[Camp Randall]], on the west side of Madison, was built and used as a training camp, a military hospital, and a prison camp for captured [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers. After the war ended, the Camp Randall site was absorbed into the University of Wisconsin and [[Camp Randall Stadium]] was built there in 1917. In 2004 the last vestige of active military training on the site was removed when the stadium renovation replaced a firing range used for [[ROTC]] training.

===1960s and 1970s===
In the 1960s and 1970s, the Madison [[counterculture]] was centered in the neighborhood of Mifflin and Bassett streets, referred to as "Miffland". The area contained many three-story apartments where students and counterculture youth lived, painted murals, and operated the co-operative grocery store, the Mifflin Street Co-op. Residents of the neighborhood often came into conflict with authorities, particularly during the administration of the Republican mayor [[William Dyke|Bill Dyke]]. Dyke was viewed by students as a direct antagonist in efforts to protest the [[Vietnam War]] because of his efforts to suppress local protests. The annual [[Mifflin Street Block Party]] became a focal point for protest, although by the late 1970s it had become a mainstream community party.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, thousands of students and other citizens took part in [[Opposition to the Vietnam War#Growing protests|anti-Vietnam War marches and demonstrations]], with more violent incidents drawing national attention to the city and UW campus. These include:
* the 1967 student protest of [[Dow Chemical Company]], with 74 injured;
* the 1969 strike to secure greater representation and rights for African-American students and faculty, which resulted in the involvement of the Wisconsin [[United States National Guard|Army National Guard]];
* the 1970 fire that caused damage to the Army [[ROTC]] headquarters housed in the [[University of Wisconsin Armory and Gymnasium]], also known as the Red Gym; and
* the 1970 late-summer predawn [[ANFO]] bombing of the Army Mathematics Research Center in Sterling Hall, killing a postdoctoral researcher, Robert Fassnacht. ''(See [[Sterling Hall bombing]])''

These protests were the subject of the 1979 documentary [[The War at Home (1979 film)|''The War at Home'']].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Eleanor Mannikka |date=2012 |title=The War at Home (1979) Review Summary |work=[[The New York Times]] |department=Movies & TV Dept. |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/52754/The-War-at-Home/overview |url-status=dead |access-date=July 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710222747/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/52754/The-War-at-Home/overview |archive-date=July 10, 2012}}</ref> [[David Maraniss]]'s 2004 book, ''[[They Marched into Sunlight]]'', incorporated the 1967 Dow protests into a larger [[Vietnam War]] narrative. Tom Bates wrote the book ''Rads'' on the subject ({{ISBN|0-06-092428-4}}). Bates wrote that Dyke's attempt to suppress the annual [[Mifflin Street Block Party]] "would take three days, require hundreds of officers on overtime pay, and engulf the student community from the nearby Southeast Dorms to [[Langdon Street Historic District|Langdon Street's]] fraternity row. [[Tear gas]] hung like heavy fog across the Isthmus." In the fracas, student activist [[Paul Soglin]], then a city [[alderman]], was arrested twice and taken to [[County jail|jail]]. Soglin was later elected mayor of Madison, serving several times.

==Geography==
{{wide image|Madison, Wisconsin skyline.jpg|300px|[[List of tallest buildings in Madison|Madison, Wisconsin skyline]]|100%|right|alt=Madison, Wisconsin skyline}}
Madison is located in the center of Dane County in south-central Wisconsin, {{convert|77|mi|km|0}} west of [[Milwaukee]] and {{convert|122|mi|km|0}} northwest of [[Chicago]]. Madison completely surrounds the city of [[Monona, Wisconsin|Monona]], and the [[Village (Wisconsin)|villages]] of [[Maple Bluff]] and [[Shorewood Hills, Wisconsin|Shorewood Hills]]. Madison shares borders with its largest suburb, [[Sun Prairie, Wisconsin|Sun Prairie]], and three other suburbs, [[Middleton, Wisconsin|Middleton]], [[McFarland, Wisconsin|McFarland]], and [[Fitchburg, Wisconsin|Fitchburg]]. Other suburbs include the city of [[Verona, Wisconsin|Verona]] and the villages of [[Cottage Grove, Wisconsin|Cottage Grove]], [[DeForest, Wisconsin|DeForest]], and [[Waunakee]] as well as [[Mount Horeb, Wisconsin|Mount Horeb]], [[Oregon, Wisconsin|Oregon]], [[Stoughton, Wisconsin|Stoughton]], and [[Cross Plains, Wisconsin|Cross Plains]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|94.03|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|76.79|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|17.24|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name="Gazetteer files">{{Cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archive-date=July 2, 2012 |access-date=November 18, 2012 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]}}</ref>

The city is sometimes described as ''The City of Four Lakes'', comprising the four successive lakes of the [[Yahara River]]: [[Lake Mendota]] ("Fourth Lake"), [[Lake Monona]] ("Third Lake"), [[Lake Waubesa]] ("Second Lake") and [[Lake Kegonsa]] ("First Lake"),<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dictionary of Wisconsin History: Four Lakes |url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=9293&term_type_id=2&term_type_text=Places&letter=F |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523184708/http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=9293&term_type_id=2&term_type_text=Places&letter=F |archive-date=May 23, 2006 |access-date=October 24, 2006 |publisher=[[Wisconsin Historical Society]]}}</ref> although Waubesa and Kegonsa are not actually in Madison, but just south of it.

The Yahara flows into the [[Rock River (Mississippi River)|Rock River]], which flows into the [[Mississippi River]]. Downtown Madison is located on an [[Madison Isthmus|isthmus]] between Lakes Mendota and Monona.
