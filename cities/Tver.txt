'''Tver''' ({{langx|ru|Тверь}}, {{IPA|ru|tvʲerʲ|IPA}}) is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] and the [[administrative centre]] of [[Tver Oblast]], [[Russia]]. It is situated at the [[confluence]] of the [[Volga]] and [[Tvertsa]] rivers. Tver is located {{convert|180|km|mi}} northwest of [[Moscow]]. Population: {{Ru-census2021|416,216|punct=.}}

The city is situated where three rivers meet, splitting the town into northern and southern parts by the Volga, and divided again into quarters by the [[Tvertsa River]], which splits the left (northern) bank into east and west halves, and the [[Tmaka River]] which does the same along the southern bank.

Tver was formerly the capital of a powerful medieval state and a model provincial town in the [[Russian Empire]], with a population of 60,000 by 14 January 1913. The city was known as '''Kalinin''' ({{langx|ru|Калинин|label=none}}) from 1931 to 1990.

==Etymology==
According to one hypothesis, the name of the city is of [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] origin, ''*Tiheverä''.<ref>Fritz Rudolf Künker GmbH & Co. KG. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=O5xn6T-TZIcC&dq=Diocese+of+Tver&pg=PA491 Diocese of Tver]''.

==History==

===Medieval origins===
Tver's foundation year is officially accepted to be 1135.<ref name="Established">Charter of Tver, Article&nbsp;1</ref>  Originally a minor settlement of [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorodian]] traders, it passed to the [[grand prince of Vladimir]] in 1209. In 1246, [[Alexander Nevsky]] granted it to his younger brother [[Yaroslav of Tver|Yaroslav Yaroslavich]] ({{died in|1271}}), from whom a dynasty of local princes descended. Four of them were killed by the [[Golden Horde]] and were proclaimed saints by the [[Russian Orthodox church]].

Formerly a land of woods and bogs, the [[Principality of Tver]] was quickly transformed into one of the richest and most populous Russian states. As the area was hardly accessible for [[Tatars|Tatar]] raids, there was a great influx of population from the recently devastated south. By the end of the century, it vied with [[Moscow]] for supremacy in Russia. Both Tver and Moscow were recently founded cities, so the outcome of their rivalry was far from certain.

===Grand princedom===
{{Main|Principality of Tver}}

[[Mikhail of Tver|Mikhail Yaroslavich]], the [[prince of Tver]], who ascended the throne of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] in 1305, was one of the most revered medieval Russian rulers. His policy of open conflict with the [[Golden Horde]] led to his assassination there in 1318. His son, [[Dmitry of Tver|Dmitry Mikhailovich]] ("the Terrible Eyes"), succeeded him and, concluding an [[military alliance|alliance]] with the mighty [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], managed to raise Tver's prestige even higher.

Exasperated by Dmitry's influence, [[Ivan I of Moscow|Ivan Kalita]], the [[prince of Moscow]], engineered his murder by the Mongols in 1326. On hearing the news of this crime, the city [[Tver Uprising of 1327|revolted against the Mongol Horde]]. The Horde joined its forces with the Muscovites and brutally repressed the [[rebellion]]. Many citizens were killed, enslaved or deported. This was the fatal blow to Tver's aspirations for supremacy in Russia.

In the second half of the 14th century, Tver was further weakened by [[dynastic]] struggles between its princes. Two senior branches of the ruling house, those of [[Kashin (town)|Kashin]] and [[Kholm, Kholmsky District, Novgorod Oblast|Kholm]]sky, asserted their claims to the grand princely throne. The claimers were backed up by Moscow and eventually settled at the [[Moscow Kremlin]] court.

During the [[Muscovite Civil War|Great Feudal War]] in the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]], Tver again rose to prominence and concluded defensive alliances with Lithuania, Novgorod, [[Byzantium]], and the Golden Horde. [[Boris of Tver]] sent one of his men, [[Afanasy Nikitin]], to search for gold and diamonds as far as [[India]]. [[A Journey Beyond the Three Seas|Nikitin's travelogue]], describing his journey from 1466 to 1472, is one of the first ever firsthand accounts of India by a European. A monument to Nikitin was opened on the Volga embankment in 1955.

===Later history===
On 12 September 1485, the forces of [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]] seized the city, leading to it to be formally annexed by Moscow. The [[Principality of Tver|principality]] was given as an [[appanage]] to Ivan's son, [[Ivan the Young]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bushkovitch |first1=Paul |title=Succession to the Throne in Early Modern Russia: The Transfer of Power 1450–1725 |date=18 March 2021 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-47934-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pAEbEAAAQBAJ |language=en}}</ref> only to be abolished several decades later. The last scions of the ruling dynasty were executed by [[Ivan the Terrible]] during the ''[[oprichnina]]''. During that turbulent time, Tver was ruled by [[Simeon Bekbulatovich]], a former khan of [[Kasimov]]. The only remnant of his ephemeral reign is a graceful [[tent-like church]] in the village of [[Kushalino]], {{convert|28|km}} northeast of Tver.

===18th century===

The city's decline was not irrevocable, however. With the foundation of [[Saint Petersburg|St.&nbsp;Petersburg]], Tver gained importance as a principal station on the highway (and later railway) en route from Moscow. It was much visited by [[Russian royalty]] and [[Russian nobility|nobility]] traveling from the old capital to the new one and back.

In the course of the [[administrative divisions of Russia in 1708–1710|administrative reform]] carried out in 1708 by [[Peter the Great]], Tver was included into [[Saint Petersburg Governorate|Ingermanlandia Governorate]] (since 1710 known as Saint Petersburg Governorate). In 1727 it was transferred to the newly established [[Novgorod Governorate]]. In 1775, [[Tver Viceroyalty]] was formed from the lands which previously belonged to Moscow and Novgorod Governorates, and the whole area was transferred to Tver Viceroyalty, which in 1796 was transformed to [[Tver Governorate]]. Tver was the center of [[Tverskoy Uyezd]].<ref name="admtv">{{cite book|last1=Малыгин|first1=П. Д.|last2=Смирнов|first2=С.

Following a devastating fire of 1763, the city was rebuilt in a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical style]]. Under [[Catherine the Great]], the central part was thoroughly reconstructed. Crumbling medieval buildings were razed and replaced with imposing Neoclassical buildings. The most important of these are the Travel Palace of the Empress (designed by the celebrated [[Matvei Kazakov]]), and the Ascension church (designed by [[Nikolay Lvov]] and consecrated in 1813).

===19th century===
In 1809, a committee was established to improve the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The XIX century |url=https://www.tver.ru/en/about/history/xix.php |access-date=2022-08-22 |website=Официальный сайт администрации города Твери}}</ref> An architect designed the Cathedral of Christ and houses on the waterfront and in the city center (30 buildings), and rebuilt the summer palace. [[Catherine Pavlovna of Russia|Catherine Pavlovna]] (a sister of [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]]) was married to the governor of Tver, and the palace was a social center and [[literary salon]] for Tver and visitors from Moscow and St. Petersburg. Writer and historian [[Nikolay Karamzin]] read excerpts from his ''History of the Russian State'' to Alexander.<ref>[http://www.novgor.ru/ltver.html Новый город: Тверь — история] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903161736/http://www.novgor.ru/ltver.html |date=September 3, 2011 }}</ref> Napoleon was near Tver in 1812.

===20th century===
[[File:ТКУ 1.jpg|thumb|left|The Tver cavalry school ]]
On 12 July 1929, the governorates and uyezds were abolished. Tverskoy District, with the administrative centre in Tver, was established within [[Tver Okrug]] of [[Moscow Oblast]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Colton |first1=Timothy J. |title=Moscow: Governing the Socialist Metropolis |date=1995 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-58749-6 |page=188 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lXM2H6tWHskC |language=en}}</ref> On 23 July 1930, the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast.<ref name="arx">{{cite web|url=http://guides.rusarchives.ru/browse/guidebook.html?bid=225&sid=767186|script-title=ru:Справка об изменениях в административно-территориальном делении Тверской губернии – Калининской области|publisher=Архивы России|language=ru|access-date=29 March 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419140741/http://guides.rusarchives.ru/browse/guidebook.html?bid=225&sid=767186|archive-date=April 19, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

On 20 November 1931, the city was renamed ''Kalinin'' after the nominal head of state (1919–1946) and affiliate of [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Mikhail Kalinin]], who had been born nearby.<ref name="Renamed">Official website of Tver.

On 29 January 1935, [[Tver Oblast|Kalinin Oblast]] was established, and Kalininsky District was transferred to Kalinin Oblast.

The last vestige of the pre-Petrine epoch, the Saviour Cathedral, was blown up in 1936. In 1940, the [[NKVD]] executed more than 6,200 Polish policemen and prisoners of war from [[Ostashkov]] camp.

The [[Wehrmacht]] entered Kalinin on Monday 13 October 1941 according to MI9 photographs, occupied Kalinin for two months from Monday 13 October 1941/Tuesday, 14 October to 19 December 1941, leaving the city in ashes. Kalinin was the first major city in [[Europe]] to be retaken from the Wehrmacht.

During the [[Cold War]], Kalinin was home to the [[Kryuchkovo]] air base, which is no longer in service. The city's historic name of Tver was restored on 17 July 1990.<ref name="Rename2">Decree of 17 July 1990</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=17 июля 1990 года Калинин стал Тверью |url=https://tvernews.ru/news/273486/ |work=Tvernews |date=17 July 2021 |language=ru}}</ref>

Apart from the suburban White Trinity Church (1564) ({{langx|ru|Храм Троицы Живоначальной}}, the Temple of the Lifegiving Trinity), there are no ancient monuments left in Tver. The central part is graced with Catharinian and Soviet edifices, bridges, and embankments. Tver's most notable industries are [[rolling stock]] manufacturer [[Tver Carriage Works]], opened in 1898, an [[excavator]] factory, and a glass factory. Tver is home to [[Migalovo]], which is one of Russia's biggest military airlift facilities.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Tver is the [[administrative centre]] of the [[oblast]]<ref name="Ref905">Law #34-ZO</ref> and, within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it also serves as the administrative centre of [[Kalininsky District, Tver Oblast|Kalininsky District]],<ref name="OKATO">{{OKATO reference|28 220}}</ref> even though it is not a part of it.<ref name="Ref905" /> As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as '''Tver [[City of federal subject significance|Okrug]]''', an administrative unit with a status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Tver Oblast|districts]].<ref name="Ref905" /> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], Tver Okrug is incorporated as '''Tver Urban Okrug'''.<ref name="Ref461">Law #4-ZO</ref>

== City division ==
[[File:Russia Tver Region Tver.svg|thumb|Districts of Tver]]
The city was divided into districts in 1936. The districts were updated several times in 1965 and 1976. The final city division, currently in use, divides the city into four districts:
# Zavolzhsky City District – part of the city, on the left bank of [[Volga River]]
# Moskovsky City District – east of the city, on the right bank of [[Volga River]] oriented towards Moscow
# Proletarsky City District – west part of the city, named after the Proletarka plant.
# Tsentralny City District – central part of the city including historical downtown and neighbourhood in a near proximity.

==Politics==
[[File:Tver duma dusk.JPG|thumb|Seat of the Tver City Duma and City Administration on Lenin Square]]

The [[Tver City Duma]], the local [[parliament]] is composed of 33 deputies. The executive branch is the Administration of Tver. The structure consists of the mayor (since 2017 – Alexey Ogonkov), his deputies, industry bodies (departments of architecture and construction, housing and communal services, health and social policy, property management and land resources; economy, investment and industrial policy, a number of departments and divisions), as well as the administration of the four districts: Zavolzhsky, Moskovsky, Proletarsky and Tsentralny. A considerable part of the government buildings of the city of Tver and the Tver Oblast lay along Sovetskaya Street: the building on the square of [[Mikhail of Tver|St. Michael]] (Sovetskaya, 44) is the residence of the Governor of the Oblast, and a former Regional Party Committee (Sovetskaya, 33) is The [[Legislative Assembly of Tver Oblast]].

Tver City Duma as a representative body of the city existed from 1785 to 1918, was reconstituted after the dissolution of [[Soviet (council)|councils]] and adoption of the new [[Constitution of Russia]] in 1993. On 20 March 1994, elections were held in the House of Representatives, which on 26 May was renamed Tver City Duma. On 7 June deputies were able to hold the first meeting, and on 14 June Valery Matitsyn was elected a speaker (later this post was held by Valery Pavlov, Victor Pochtaryov, Dmitry Bazhenov, Igor Serdyuk, Andrei Borisenko, Lyudmila Polosina, Vladimir Babichev). In 1996, deputies adopted the founding document of the city – the Charter of the city of Tver, putting in it the principle of rotation in the Duma elections. Second election based on it was held on 27 October 1996 . In the future years elections held every two years in the "even" and "odd" electoral districts. In 2007, 12 former deputies (including the former chairman of the Duma Victor Pochtaryov) were convicted of taking bribes for decisions in favor of Rosvodokanal and other utilities. In October 2008, the elections of some deputies have already passed on party lists, and in March 2009 the entire City Duma has been transferred to this system, while discontinued the practice of rotation of deputies. In the elections of 2009, the best result (49 % of the vote) was shown by [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|local communists]].

On 27 October 1996 simultaneously with elections to the City Duma passed the first general elections of the head of the city, won by Alexander Belousov, who led the municipal administration since 1991 and received more than 50 % of the vote. On 30 October 2000 he was reelected to a second term, and on 9 April 2003 he died of a heart attack. On 26 July 2001 in early Mayoral elections opposition candidate Oleg Lebedev won. On 2 December 2007 when he was supported by the pro-government party [[United Russia]], he was re-elected for a second term, receiving more than 70 % of the vote. On 11 April 2008 he was suspended by the Tsentralny District Court in connection with a criminal case opened in 2005, closed in 2006 and renewed by the [[Prosecutor General of Russia]] in March 2008 (Lebedev was accused of hindering the work of the investigation against his deputy Oleg Kudryashov). On 2 May Oleg Lebedev was reinstated, and on 3 June, again dismissed, and on 25 June he was taken into custody and transported to [[Kashin (town)|Kashin]], where he was convicted by visiting college of Tver Regional Court jury to eighteen years’ imprisonment, which automatically meant the termination of his powers. In 2009, he was released on parole, but the position was not restored.

In late 2008, Tver City Duma adopted amendments to the charter of the city, under which direct elections of the Mayor were abolished and a new position of head of the city administration introduced. This amendment to the charter of the city was met with a mixed public reaction and local attempts to bring the issue by the Communists to citywide referendum were not supported by City Duma. In March 2009, City Duma elected Vladimir Babichev as the new mayor (now ceremonial post), and in May the same year, Vasily Toloko was appointed as the head of the city administration. He had previously been the first deputy governor of the Tver Oblast. The mayor and the head of the local administration were elected with a thin majority of seventeen votes (United Russia, Fair Russia and the Liberal Democratic Party) against sixteen (Communist Party). On 27 December 2011 by a majority vote (22 for, six against) City Council voted in favor of early termination of Vasily Toloko. On 29 March 2012 the Tver City Duma (25 for, 4 against) appointed Valery Pavlov to the post of Head of the Administration. He had previously held the post of the first deputy head of Cuty Administration.

On 2 November 2012 Alexander Korzin was appointed as mayor of the city. In 2014, he left his post, and on May 28, 2014, by the decision of the Tver City Duma, Yury Timofeev was appointed to this post, previously working for 10 years as the head of the [[Zapadnodvinsky District]]. On 22 September 2016, immediately after [[Igor Rudenya]] assumed the post of governor, Timofeev resigned and Alexey Ogonkov, who claimed this position in 2014, became acting Mayor.

In August 2017, the Tver City Duma adopted amendments to the Charter of the city, according to which the Mayor also heads the administration. Thus, the "two-headed management" system introduced in 2008 was abolished. The amendments entered into force on November 2, 2017, after Alexander Korzin's term as Mayor has expired. Thus, from 2 November 2017 Alexey Ogonykov became the Mayor.

===Railway===
The [[Oktyabrskaya Railway]] linking Moscow and St.&nbsp;Petersburg crosses the city. Since 1850, there has been a railway connection between Tver and Moscow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nnov-airport.ru/rus/wokzal_tver.html|title=Train Station in Tver|language=ru|access-date=March 29, 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313004927/http://nnov-airport.ru/rus/wokzal_tver.html|archive-date=March 13, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The primary Tver Railway Station has a locomotive and car shed, allowing it to service both passenger and cargo trains. In addition to the Tver Central Station, there are four minor stations within the city perimeter: Lazurnaya, Proletarskaya,  Doroshikha and PPGT. The suburban railway service links Tver to [[Moscow]], [[Bologoye, Tver Oblast|Bologoye]], [[Torzhok]]. Most trains passing from Moscow to the north-west regions make a short stop in Tver. The high-speed train [[Sapsan]], which connects Moscow with St. Petersburg, also makes stops in Tver, as well as the [[Tolstoy|Tolstoy train]] connecting Moscow to [[Helsinki]], Finland.

The newly designed high-speed railway line between Moscow and St Petersburg is expected to have a "New Tver'" station several kilometres southward of the city border.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.izvestia.ru/news/363476|title=Триллион "Сапсана"|date=July 7, 2010|access-date=March 29, 2018}}</ref>

===Roads===
The major [[M10 highway (Russia)|M10 Highway]] linking Moscow and St.&nbsp;Petersburg also crosses the city. This motorway is a part of the [[Pan-European corridors]] system. The roads to [[Rzhev]] (A112), [[Vesyegonsk]] (P84) and [[Volokolamsk]] (P90), along with many smaller regional roads, originate in the city. The new highway between Moscow and St.&nbsp;Petersburg, that is designed at the present time, will pass close to the northern border of Tver. Tver is notable for a high number of private cars: there are 288&nbsp;cars per thousand residents, which is well above average among the other regions of Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rating.rbc.ru/article.shtml?2008/09/30/32143066|title=РБК 500: Крупнейшие компании России|access-date=March 29, 2018}}</ref>

===Public transit===
There is a local bus station that interconnects Tver with minor towns of Tver Oblast, neighbouring oblasts, and Moscow.

Local public transit consists of [[trolleybus]]es, buses, and ''[[marshrutka]]s'' (routed taxis). The latter two have taken priority during recent years. 

In the past, trams carried passengers in Tver, however, in November 2018, the tram traffic in Tver was completely stopped. On August 7, 2019, all car drivers, as well as track fitters and support staff of the trams, left by "mutual agreement".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Chronology: Tver|url=https://transphoto.org/news.php?cid=8|access-date=2021-05-20|website=transphoto.org|language=en}}</ref> At the same time, the dismantling of the contact network and the tracks along the last existing route began. The city administration said that it was necessary to completely repair the roadbed.

In recent years, there has been a tendency to reduce the route network of trolley buses. During the first quarter of 2020, local authorities plan to introduce a new transport model, which implies the elimination of trolleybus traffic and the duplication of its routes with buses. From April 14, 2020, the last of the existing trolleybus routes (No. 2) was replaced by a bus route 42 on which diesel buses now operate.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Tver|url=https://transphoto.org/city/8/|access-date=2021-05-20|website=transphoto.org|language=en}}</ref>

[[File:Tver nunnery.JPG|thumb|The Monastery of Christ's Nativity]]
[[File:Татарская мечеть (2).jpg|thumb|Tver mosque]]
Tver has four functioning Russian Orthodox cathedrals, fifteen Orthodox churches, a [[Mormon]] chapel, a Catholic church, a [[mosque]], and a [[synagogue]].

Within Tver, as in other cities of [[Central Russia]], the main religion is [[Russian Orthodox Christianity]]. Tver is the centre of [[Diocese of Tver and Kashin]] of the Russian Orthodox Church, having the diocesan administration and residence of the ruling bishop. Since 14 July 2018 the [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of Tver and Kashin has been Savva (Mikheyev).

White Trinity Temple in Zatmachye, recently renamed Trinity Cathedral, built in 1564 and since repeatedly reconstructed, is the oldest surviving stone building in Tver. It is subordinate to the ruling bishop. Ascension Cathedral, built in the 1750s, is in the historic centre of the city on Tverskoy Avenue and has the status of an episcopal monastery. Preserved Assumption Cathedral 18th century pre-existing Otroch monastery is in Trans-Volga district, near the mouth of [[Tvertsa river]]. Resurrection Cathedral was built in 1912–1913, marking the [[300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty]], and in the 1990s, after the return of the church, received the status of the cathedral and is directly subordinate to the ruling bishop. Not far from the cathedral is the Cathedral of the Nativity of Christ and the monastery, built in the 1810s.
