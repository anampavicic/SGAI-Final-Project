'''Coral Springs''' is a city in [[Broward County, Florida]], United States. The city is located approximately {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} northwest of [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]]. As of the [[2020 United States Census|2020 U.S. Census]], the city had a population of 134,394. It is a principal city of the [[Miami metropolitan area]] in [[South Florida]], which was home to an estimated 6,012,331 people at the 2015 census.

The city, officially chartered on July 10, 1963, was master-planned and primarily developed by Coral Ridge Properties, Inc., which was acquired by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] in 1966. The city's name is derived from the company's name, and was selected after several earlier proposals had been considered and rejected.<ref name=history>{{cite web | url=http://www.coralsprings.org/living/history | title=Coral Springs: History | access-date=October 26, 2017 | archive-date=October 4, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004130557/http://www.coralsprings.org/living/history | url-status=dead }}</ref> Despite the name, there are no natural [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] in the city; Florida's springs are found in the central and northern portions of the state.<ref name=nosprings>{{cite web |url=http://fl.water.usgs.gov/PDF_files/fs151_95_spechler.pdf |title=Springs of Florida |publisher=United States Geological Survey |last1=Spechler |first1=Rick M |last2=Schiffer |first2=Donna M. |access-date=July 19, 2007}}</ref>

During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s the young city grew rapidly, adding over 35,000 residents each decade. Coral Springs has notably strict building codes, which are designed to maintain the city's distinctive aesthetic appeal. The city government's effective fiscal management has maintained high bond ratings, and the city has won accolades for its overall livability, its low crime rate, and its family-friendly orientation.

==History==
Coral Springs is a [[planned community]]. Prior to its incorporation as a city in July 1963, the area which is now Coral Springs was part of {{convert|20000|acre|km2}} of marshy lands bought by Henry Lyons between 1911 and 1939. After several [[1947 Atlantic hurricane season|floods]] in 1947, Florida created the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control District (now the [[South Florida Water Management District]]). [[Canals]] and [[levees]] drained much of the area upon which Coral Springs was built. After the land was drained and cleared, most of the area was used as a bean farm. After Lyons' death in 1952, his heirs changed the focus to cattle.<ref name=history/>

A post-[[World War II]] real estate boom in South Florida attracted the interest of developers. Coral Ridge Properties, which already had several developments in [[Broward County]], bought {{convert|3869|acre|km2|0}} of land from the Lyons family on December 14, 1961, for $1 million.<ref name=history/> The City of Coral Springs was chartered on July 10, 1963. Other names that were considered for the new city included "Curran Village," "Pompano Springs" and "Quartermore". By 1964, the company had developed a master plan for a city of 50,000 residents. On July 22, 1964, the first sale of 536 building lots netted $1.6 million. The [[Coral Springs Covered Bridge|landmark covered bridge]] was built that same year to promote the town. In 1965, Coral Ridge Properties bought an additional {{convert|6000|acre|km2}} from the Lyons family, increasing the city's land area to {{convert|16|sqmi|km2|0}}. The first city government elections were held in 1967.

The city added 19 public schools, a regional mall, shopping centers and parks between 1970 and 2000 in response to rapid population growth. The biggest [[shopping mall]] in the city is [[Coral Square]], which opened in October 1984 with {{convert|945000|sqft|m2|-2}} of retail space and more than 120 stores. The construction of the [[Sawgrass Expressway]] in 1986 brought even more growth. A museum and a theater opened in the 1990s. The city reached residential [[build-out]] in 2003<ref name=sfmc>{{cite web | url=http://www.coralsprings.org/home/showdocument?id=2738 | title=City of Coral Springs: Business Plan Development Business Plan Development Workshop | date=June 23, 2004 | access-date=October 26, 2017 | archive-date=September 10, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910142915/http://www.coralsprings.org/home/showdocument?id=2738 | url-status=dead }}</ref> and is very close to a commercial build-out.<ref>{{cite web | title=Greater Fort Lauderdale Alliance: Coral Springs | url=http://www.gflalliance.org/information-center/coral-springs/ | publisher=Greater Fort Lauderdale Alliance}}</ref>

===Climate===
Coral Springs experiences a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: '''Af'''). Average monthly rainfall is higher from April to September, with January and February as the driest months. The average monthly rainfall ranges from {{convert|2.8|in|cm|0}} in January and February to {{convert|7.3|in|cm|0}} in June. The [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]] is from June to November, with September as the month during which hurricanes are most likely to occur. The most powerful hurricane to strike Coral Springs since its incorporation was [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]] in 2005; the eye of the hurricane passed directly over the city. The city estimated that "as a result of the numerous hurricanes and storms that hit Coral Springs in 2004/2005, and especially as a result of Hurricane Wilma, the tree canopy coverage throughout the city has been reduced by about one third".<ref name=hurricanes>{{cite web | url=http://www.coralsprings.org/home/showdocument?id=9236 | title=Homeowner's Tree Ownership and Care Guide | publisher=City of Coral Springs | access-date=October 26, 2017 | archive-date=October 26, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026214439/http://www.coralsprings.org/home/showdocument?id=9236 | url-status=dead }}</ref> A 2017 study put Coral Springs in fourth place for US cities most vulnerable to [[coastal flooding]], with 115,000 residents living within [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]]'s coastal [[floodplain]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.climatecentral.org/news/us-cities-most-vulnerable-major-coastal-flooding-sea-level-rise-21748|title=These U.S. Cities Are Most Vulnerable to Major Coastal Flooding and Sea Level Rise|date=October 25, 2017|website=www.climatecentral.org|language=en|access-date=2019-12-19|archive-date=December 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191219210134/https://www.climatecentral.org/news/us-cities-most-vulnerable-major-coastal-flooding-sea-level-rise-21748|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The steel bridge, {{convert|40|ft|m|0}} in length, is the only covered bridge in Florida in the public [[right-of-way]]. The [[American Snuff Company]] provided two historical designs for the bridge sides, to make the structure appear aged. The Covered Bridge is depicted in Coral Springs' seal. The Museum of Coral Springs History started as a real estate office. Built outside the city limits, the single-room wooden structure was moved to Coral Springs and became its first administration building. Later it was used as the first police station, and as a [[Jaycees]] clubhouse; it was moved to the city dump in 1976, where it was used as a fire department training site for smoke drills. After it was inadvertently set on fire, public outcry prompted the building's relocation to Mullins Park for restoration. Since 1978, it has housed the city's history museum. The exhibits in the museum are historic items and city models.<ref name=minimuseum>{{cite web |url=http://www.coralsprings.org/history/MiniMuseum.cfm |title=Museum of Coral Springs History |author=Wangberg, Wendy |publisher=City of Coral Springs |access-date=June 25, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222192331/http://www.coralsprings.org/history/MiniMuseum.cfm |archive-date=February 22, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>
