'''Pagadian''', officially the '''City of Pagadian''' ({{lang-ceb|Dakbayan sa Pagadian}}; [[Subanon language|Subanen]]: ''Gembagel G'benwa Pagadian''; [[Maguindanao language|Maguindanaon]]: ''Kuta nu Pagadian'', كوت نو ڤڬديان; [[Iranun language|Iranun]]: ''Bandar a Pagadian'', بندر ا ڤاڬاديان; {{lang-cbk|Ciudad de Pagadian}}; {{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Pagadian}}), is a 1st class [[Component city of the Philippines|component city]] and the capital of the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Zamboanga del Sur]], Philippines. It is the regional center of [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] and the second-largest city in the region and in the province, after the independent [[Zamboanga City|city of Zamboanga]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 210,452 people.{{PH census|current}} The city will be converted to a highly urbanized city by the virtue of Proclamation No. 1247, signed by President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] dated November 8, 2021.<ref name="The Official Gazette">{{cite web|url=https://mirror.officialgazette.gov.ph/downloads/2021/11nov/20211108-PROC-1247-RRD.pdf|title=Proclamation 1247|publisher=The Official Gazette|date=November 8, 2021 |access-date=November 15, 2021}}</ref>

Pagadian began as stop-over for traders who plied the road between the old [[Zamboanga City|Spanish fort-town of Zamboanga]] on the southwestern tip of the [[Zamboanga Peninsula (geographical region)|Zamboanga Peninsula]] and other bigger towns to the north of the old [[Zamboanga (province)|Zamboanga Province]]. Except for its sheltered bay and good fishing grounds, it was not a promising site because it is situated on steeply rolling terrain. In the course of its local history, waves of different kinds of people came to stay, and eventually called among themselves "Pagadianons".

The iconic symbol of Pagadian is its uniquely designed tricycle built to adopt to the city's hilly terrain. It is the only place in the Philippines with a public transport inclined at about 25-40° angle.<ref>[http://tourism-philippines.com/pagadian-city/ Tourism Philippines] (retrieved: July 17, 2012)</ref><ref>[http://journeyingjames.com/2011/05/pagadian-adventures-inclined-tricycles-of-pagadian-city/ The Inclined Tricycles of Pagadian City] (retrieved: July 17, 2012)</ref><ref>[http://mypagadian.com/ My Pagadian.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228154000/http://mypagadian.com/ |date=February 28, 2009 }}(retrieved: March 31, 2009)</ref> In recent years, these iconic inclined public transport has been slowly being replaced by modernized tricycles, locally called "bao-bao" a kind of [[auto rickshaw]], due to the latter's fuel-efficiency, less noise and being environment-friendly due to its smoke-less emissions.

==Etymology==
The city proper and surrounding areas of today's barangays of Muricay, Tawagan Sur and White Beach was originally named Talapukan, an indigenous word that means "a place of numerous springs."<ref name="Legend">{{cite web|url=http://www.pagadian.com/legend.htm |title=Legend of Pagadian City |access-date=April 26, 2009 |publisher=Pagadian.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208125242/http://pagadian.com/Legend.htm |archive-date=February 8, 2009 }}</ref> The officially accepted origin of its name are words taken from [[Iranun language|Iranun]], ''pagad'' ("to wait") and ''padian'' ("market")<ref name="Legend"/> which shows that Pagadian had been a trading area in the past. Other theories suggest that it was named after a bird that the native inhabitants call ''gagadian'' or that the city's name came from the word ''pangadyi'' ("prayer"), later to be known as ''pangadyian'' ("a place to pray" or "land of prayers"). The name Pagadian is also speculated to be derived from the [[Subanen language|Subanen]] word ''pengadian'' which means "school".

== History ==
===Subanons (Early Historic Era) ===
{{main|Subanon people}}
The first known settlers in Pagadian were the [[Subanon people]].<ref name="Hapalla2002">Hapalla JGH. An introduction to Subanen culture. Culture and peace studies. Ateneo de Zamboanga University. 2002;2(1):1–11.</ref> The settlers in what would later become Pagadian referred to themselves as "''getaw Belengasa''," or "from around the Balangasan River" to distinguish themselves from the nearby Subanen populations who were "''getaw Dumenghilas''" (from around the Dumangkilas River and Bay), "''getaw Sibuguey''" (from around the Sibuguey River and Bay), or "''getaw Thebed''" (from around the river of Thebed in Labangan).<ref name="Hapalla2002"/>

[[Iranun people|Iranun]] and [[Maguindanao people|Maguindanaon]] settlers then came and converted the people to Islam.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}} A sizeable number of Subanons who refused to convert eventually settled in the highlands.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

===Spread of Islam (Pre-20th Century) ===
Pagadian was under the rule of Sultan Datu Akob, an Iranun [[datu]] whose daughter caught the fancy of Datu Macaumbang (Sultan of Taga Nonok), also an Iranun from Malabang, Tukuran that is now part of Pagadian. He was the son of Sharif Apo Tubo who descended from the bloodline of [[Sharif Kabungsuan]], the first Sultan of the [[Maguindanao Sultanate]]. With the approval of Sultan Datu Akob, Datu Macaumbang married Bai Putri Panyawan Akob, the beautiful daughter of the Sultan of Pagadian and Royal Bai Putri of Raya.<ref name="The Iranon Tribe Blogspot">[http://iranunnation.blogspot.com/2009/03/history-of-pagadian-city.html The Iranon Tribe Blogspot] (retrieved: March 29, 2009)</ref>

Upon the death of Datu Akob also known as Datu Mimbalawag, his son-in-law, Datu Macaumbang (Sultan of Taga Nonok) assumed leadership; he established the territorial boundaries of the present city proper, from Balangasan River in the west of Tawagan Sur River in the east. Beyond the river of Tawagan Sur was the territory of Datu Balimbingan. At one time, Datu Macaumbang requested the assistance of the Philippine constabulary due to the rampant banditry and piracy in the area. A detachment led by Col. Tiburcio Ballesteros stationed at Malangas landed at the place and stationed themselves at Dumagoc Island. The arrival of the soldiers restored peace and order, thereby attracting the influx of settlers from other places.<ref name="The Iranon Tribe Blogspot"/>

===Spread of Christianity (Early 1900s)===
{{See also|Roman Catholic Diocese of Pagadian}}
Christian settlers started arriving in the early part of the 20th century, most of which came from Cebu as evident on the veneration of the [[Santo Niño de Cebú]]. The increasing Christian population prompted the creation of the Parish of Pagadian in 1938 and was administered by the Jesuits, Columban and Filipino priests. The original Santo Niño Church of Pagadian was right across the city plaza, on the site of the current San Jose Parish church. The present Santo Niño Cathedral is now located in San Francisco District and was built in 1968.<ref name="Pagdiocese">{{cite web |url=http://pagadian.com/Diocese.htm |title=History of the Diocese of Pagadian - translated from Cebuano |access-date=April 26, 2009 |publisher=Pagadian.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528144336/http://pagadian.com/Diocese.htm |archive-date=May 28, 2009 }}</ref>

Pagadian Parish became a diocese on November 2, 1971, and is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Ozamis. Msgr. Jesus B. Tuquib served as the first bishop and was installed on February 24, 1973.<ref name="Pagdiocese"/> At that time, the [[Missionary Society of St. Columban|Columban Fathers]] took care of the apostolic services for the first 13 parishes in the newly formed diocese.

As of 2008, the Diocese of Pagadian had 24 parishes.<ref name="Ucan pagdiocese">{{cite web|url=http://www.ucanews.com/../dps-pr_pagadian.php|title=Ucan Diocesan Profiles|publisher=UCA News|date=April 22, 2009 |access-date=July 11, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

===Under Margosatubig (1920s) ===
The present-day Pagadian had its beginnings as a [[sitio]] of [[Margosatubig]]. In July 1927, it became a barrio under the Municipal District of [[Labangan]], Zamboanga del Sur upon the implementation of Executive Order no.70.<ref>Labangan Teachers, p69. (retrieved: March 29, 2009)</ref>

===Prewar Era (1930s) ===
[[File:Pajares Avenue 1953.jpg|thumb|left|F.S Pajares Avenue Circa 1953]]
The transfer the seat of the Labangan Government to Pagadian was made in 1934 through the efforts of Director Teofisto Guingona, Sr. who was commissioned by [[Leonard Wood|Philippine Governor-General Leonard Wood]] to find out the possibility of transferring the seat of government of the Labangan municipality to another place. A conference was first held, together with the Datus and the early Christian settlers as the idea of the transfer was at first largely opposed by the Christians. Eventually, a consensus was reached when the designated committee led by Datu Balimbingan of Labangan and with the consent of Datu Macaumbang surveyed the western part of the present area and found ''Talpokan'', a part of the barrio of Pagadian, deemed as a suitable place for such transfer. At the same time, Datu Macaumbang donated 260&nbsp;hectares of land to Christians who were willing to transfer to the area.<ref>[http://www.1stphilippines.com/pc-1d2a9c479f8657c9826df8f6969d306c.html 1stphilippines.com - Pagadian History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222012153/http://www.1stphilippines.com/pc-1d2a9c479f8657c9826df8f6969d306c.html |date=February 22, 2009 }} (retrieved: March 29, 2009)</ref>

On March 23, 1937, Pagadian became a municipality through Executive Order 77 due to the eager initiative of then Assemblyman Juan S. Alano, with the Jose Sanson appointed as acting mayor. Norberto Bana Sr. was elected as the first officially elected municipal mayor after the regular elections. The Municipality of Pagadian was formed by merging the municipal districts of [[Labangan]] and [[Dinas, Zamboanga del Sur|Dinas]],<ref>History of Zamboanga del Sur, p37-38 (retrieved: March 29, 2009)</ref> as a result, making Labangan a district under its former barrio. The newly created town had 19 barangays or districts.<ref>History of Zamboanga del Sur, p38 (retrieved: March 29, 2009)</ref> In 1950 the barrios of Dinas, Legarda, Mirapao, Migpulao, Kalipapa, Pisaan, Bubway, Tiniguangan, Tabina and Dimataling which were under the Municipality of Pagadian, were incorporated into the newly created town of [[Dimataling, Zamboanga del Sur|Dimataling]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra555.html |title=An act to create the municipality of Dimataling in the province of Zamboanga |publisher=LawPH.com |access-date=April 9, 2011|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712215215/http://lawph.com/statutes/ra555.html |archive-date=July 12, 2012 }}</ref> In the same manner, the barrios of Dumalinao Proper, Begong, Nilo, Tigbao, Ticwas, Balongating, Baguitan, Pantad, Napolan, Tagulo, Camanga, Maragang, Sibucao, Tina, Guling, Miculong, Baga, Rebucon, and Mambilik were constituted into [[Dumalinao, Zamboanga del Sur|Dumalinao]] in 1956.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra1593.html |title=An Act Creating Municipality of Dumalinao in the Province of Zamboanga Del Sur |publisher=LawPH.com |access-date=April 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710083210/http://lawph.com/statutes/ra1593.html |archive-date=July 10, 2012 }}</ref>

=== During World War II ===
{{main|Battle of Mindanao}}
Pagadian was occupied by Japanese troops during [[World War II]]. From November 5 to 20, 1944, the combined American and Filipino troops attempted to take the town from the Japanese. Sixteen Japanese soldiers were killed, but they remained in possession of Pagadian.<ref name="Kent Holmes 2015 p. 116">Kent Holmes, ''Wendell Fertig and His Guerrilla Forces in the Philippines: Fighting the Japanese Occupation'' (Jefferson, N.C.: 2015), p. 116</ref>

The establishment of the general headquarters of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] and the [[Philippine Constabulary]] were stationed in Pagadian and active from November 21, 1944, to June 30, 1946, during and in the aftermath of [[World War II]], including the military operations and engagements against the Japanese and liberated areas in [[Mindanao]] from November 21, 1944, to August 15, 1945.<ref name="Kent Holmes 2015 p. 116" />

=== 1950s to the 1970s and the Martial Law Years ===
{{main|Moro conflict|Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos|Human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship}}
On June 6, 1952, Congressman Roseller T. Lim authored R.A. 711 dividing Zamboanga into two provinces - ''Norte'' (north) and ''Sur'' (south) then three months after, on September 17, 1952, it became the capital town of the newly established province of Zamboanga del Sur. Pagadian became a chartered city through R.A. 5478 on June 21, 1969, becoming the third city in the [[Zamboanga Peninsula (Administrative Region)]].

On August 16, 1976, the city was one of the hardest hit areas in the [[1976 Moro Gulf Earthquake|Moro Gulf earthquake and tsunami]] of 1976, considered as the most devastating tsunami in the Philippines in recent times.<ref name="tsunami1976">{{cite web|url=http://www.drgeorgepc.com/Tsunami1976Phillipines.html|title=The Philippine Tsunami of 1976|access-date=April 26, 2009|publisher=www.drgeorgepc.com}}</ref> Pagadian was the major city in the area that was struck by both the earthquake and tsunami and sustained the greatest number of casualties.<ref name="tsunami1976" /><ref>[http://earthquake.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/update_SOEPD/Earthquake/1976MoroGulfEQ/index-moro.html Phivolcs Report, Earthquake of 1976] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427132335/http://earthquake.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/update_SOEPD/Earthquake/1976MoroGulfEQ/index-moro.html |date=April 27, 2011 }}(retrieved: March 31, 2009)</ref>

===Growth as a City (late 1980s-present) ===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}

In the 1980s, mayor Benjamin Arao initiated a layout for the city's future expansion by proposing a North Diversion Road of which a part would connect to F.S. Pajares Avenue, one of the city's two major roads via a Rotunda that overlooks the greater [[Illana Bay]] and the [[Moro Gulf]] beyond.

==== Designation as regional center for Region IX ====
In October 1990 President [[Corazon Aquino]] issued Executive Order 429 that designated Pagadian as the Regional Center for Region - IX (Zamboanga Peninsula).<ref name="Philippines Law Online">[http://www.lawphil.net/executive/execord/eo1990/eo_429_1990.html Philippines Law Online] (retrieved: March 16, 2009)</ref> But it was not until November 12, 2004 that Pagadian officially became the Regional Center due in part to the opposition of [[Zamboanga City]], the former regional center, which delayed the process of the transfer.

====Highly urbanized city====
Proclamation No. 1247 was signed by President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] on December 8, 2021, which sought to convert Pagadian into a highly urbanized city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=CONVERSION OF THE CITY OF PAGADIAN, ZAMBOANGA DEL SUR INTO A HIGHLY-URBANIZED CITY |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/downloads/2021/11nov/20211108-PROC-1247-RRD.pdf |access-date=July 5, 2023 |website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines}}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:Pagadian City Pajares Avenue from Rotonda.jpg|thumb|upright|Pagadian City view from the Rotonda]]
Pagadian is on the northeastern side of the Western Mindanao region, bordering on [[Illana Bay]]. It is bounded by the municipalities of [[Tigbao, Zamboanga del Sur|Tigbao]] and [[Dumalinao]] on the southwest, [[Lakewood, Zamboanga del Sur|Lakewood]] on the west, [[Labangan]] on the east and northwest, and [[Midsalip]] on the north.

About 45% of the total city area is steeply sloping terrain of hills and mountains on the northwestern portion that covers an estimated 15,090&nbsp;hectares. Mt. Sugarloaf (1,376 m.), [[Mount Pinukis|Mt. Pinukis]] (1,213 m.), and Mt. Palpalan (650 m.) are the three notable mountain peaks. Areas in the direct north and central part, have gentle to moderate slopes, making up 47% of the total. The remaining 8% is level or nearly level which makes up most of the eastern and the southern parts of the city. The urban area covers about 845.48&nbsp;hectares. Elevation of the urban area of the city ranges from 1 MSL ''([[mean sea level]])'' near Pagadian Bay to about 100 MSL in the area of Barangay San Jose.

The Tiguma, Bulatoc, Gatas, and Balangasan Rivers, drain to Pagadian Bay and serve as natural drainage. Due to its topography, most of the city's 54 barangays do not experience flooding. The low-lying southern and eastern part of the city occasionally experience [[flooding]], especially during heavy rains.

The people of Pagadian (Pagadianons) are classified into three main groups which is based primarily on faith and heritage: (a) the Subanens (or any other [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous tribes]] who had been living in the area before the advent of Islam in Mindanao), (b) the [[Muslims|Muslim]] settlers who came from other parts of Mindanao and other places such as [[Sabah]] and [[Indonesia]], and (c) the [[Christians|Christian]] settlers who generally came from the Visayas and Luzon.

The majority of Pagadianons speak the [[Cebuano language]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pagadian.org/bisaya.htm |title=Cebuano, Hiligaynon, ilonggo, Aklanon, Capiznon, Kinaray-a, Bantoanon, Romblomanon, Cuyonon, Waray, Surigaonon, Butuanon, Tausog, dialect, cebuano, bisayans, visayans, bisaya, bisaya, bisdak, bisayang dako, bisaya, binisaya, bisaya, language |publisher=Pagadian.org |date=March 27, 2009 |access-date=March 23, 2022}}</ref> The national language, [[Filipino language|Filipino]] ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]) is widely understood and is the native tongue of a small percentage of the population. [[Maguindanao people|Maguindanaon]], [[iranun people|Iranun]], [[Maranao people|Maranao]], [[Tausūg people|Tausug]], and [[Sama-Bajau|Samal]] languages are used by the Muslim community. The [[Subanon language|Subanen]] dialect is exclusively used by the Subanen people, the original inhabitants of the area. Remaining percentage of the population are classified as [[Hiligaynon people|Hiligaynon]] and [[Zamboangueño people|Zamboangueño]] speakers. As with the rest of the Philippines, English is widely understood and is used as the primary language for business.

== Economy ==
[[File:Pagadian Agora.JPG|thumb|Pagadian City Agora Public Market]]
[[File:Home town pics 020.jpg|thumb|Boats along the Pagadian fishport]]

Pagadian posted an average annual regular income of P662,511,106.21 from fiscal year 2009 to 2016, thus classifying it as a 1st class [[Component city of the Philippines|component city]] in the Philippines. As of 2023, it is the 7th wealthiest city in Mindanao with a total asset of P5.568 Billion.<ref>[https://youtube.com/@VISAYASTOP/ Top 10 Wealthiest Cities in Mindanao 2023] (retrieved: July 29, 2023)</ref>

The city has an increasing number of businesses in the service sector mainly due to the transfer of the regional offices from Zamboanga City resulting to an influx of visitors from other towns and cities in the Zamboanga Peninsula. This is evident on the current bullish construction trend in the city. Some malls already had made a presence but the most prominent is the city-owned mall, [[City Commercial Center]] or C3 Mall, which was built in 2011. However, [[agriculture]] is still considered the primary economic resource with the production of rice, corn, coconut, fruit, root crops and animal husbandry. Special funding-assistance programs by the government are made available for local farmers; the ''City Livelihood Development Assistance Program'' (CILDAP) extends loans to those who need financial assistance for their livelihood.

Production of raw materials like seaweeds, coco processing, cassava constitute a large part of the local economy; small-scale manufacturing of furniture and decors made out of wood, bamboo, rattan, steel and plastic; handicrafts made out of bamboo, rattan, coco shell, wood, marine shell, ceramics, and weaving.

Pagadian Bay and the outer [[Illana Bay]] (Iranun Bay) abound with a wide variety of marine products; seaweed culture farming is flourishing in waters off the bay while fishponds near or along the bay yields milkfish, prawns and crabs. A number of large deep-sea fishing vessels that venture into the [[Sulu Sea]] and as far as the [[South China Sea]] make Pagadian fishport their base of operation. Because of this, the city is also one of the major suppliers of dried fish and other kinds of seafood in the region. 

Another income-generating industry is mining in an area located 1.5&nbsp;km southeast of Barangay Lison Valley proper approximately forty-nine kilometers from the city proper which yields gold, copper and [[molybdenum]].

==Culture==

=== Festivals ===
The City Fiesta is celebrated every third Sunday of January in honor of its patron saint, the Holy Child Jesus (''Santo Niño'') which coincides with the feastday of [[Cebu City]]. It is officially called the ''Pasalamat Festival'' highlighted with a fluvial parade (''regatta''), trade exhibits, the ''Mutya ng Pagadian'' beauty pageant, carnival shows and a civic military parade. On every June 21, the ''Araw ng Pagadian'' is celebrated in commemoration of its founding as a chartered city; as Capital of Zamboanga del Sur, the city hosts the annual provincial celebration in September with agro-trade exhibits, a civic-military parade, cultural presentations and sports competitions.

The Megayon Festival is a week-long celebration that coincides with the Zamboanga del Sur anniversary in September. It honors the tri-people settlers: the [[Subanon people|Subanens]], BangsaMoro Muslims and [[Christians]].<ref>[http://www.unsapa.com/news-bits/zambo-sur-to-celebrate-55th-founding-year.html Unsapa.com - ZamboSur Anniversary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120154418/http://www.unsapa.com/news-bits/zambo-sur-to-celebrate-55th-founding-year.html |date=November 20, 2008 }} (retrieved: April 26, 2009)</ref> "''Megayon''" is a [[Subanon language|Subanen]] word which means "Unity and Solidarity". The festival is a showcase of three distinctly different cultural heritage in songs, dances, rituals of peace, foods and crafts, to foster unity and understanding among the three cultures. Environment-related activities, peace and development forum, and indigenous sports competitions<ref>[http://www.pia.gov.ph/?m=12&fi=p060914.htm&no=49 PIA - Zamboanga del Sur] (retrieved: April 26, 2009)</ref> are being held.
