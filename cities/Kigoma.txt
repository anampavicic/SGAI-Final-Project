It serves as the capital for the surrounding [[Kigoma Region]] and has a population of 232,388 (2022 census).<ref name=pop/> The city is situated at an elevation of {{convert|775|m}}.

Kigoma is one of the busiest ports on northeastern [[Lake Tanganyika]] since historically it was the only one that had a functioning railway connection (the one at [[Kalemie]] in The Democratic Republic of the Congo is not operational at the moment{{when|date=September 2019}}), a direct link to the ocean [[port]] at [[Dar es Salaam]]. Kigoma Port in the Kigoma Bay has a wharf of {{convert|200|m|spell=in}} and several cranes and is equipped to handle shipping containers.<ref>[http://www.trctz.com/kigoma.htm Tanzania Railways Corporation: ''Kigoma Port.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928074527/http://www.trctz.com/kigoma.htm |date=2007-09-28 }} Retrieved 30 May 2007.</ref> However, the bay is suffering from silting up as a result of soil erosion from surrounding hills, and the water depths at wharfside has diminished from {{convert|6|m}} to {{convert|1.8|m}}. This may threaten the economic growth of the port. In May 2007 the Tanzanian Government announced a plan to create an economic zone at the port to stimulate trade and to ensure stable economic growth of the Port for the government in Power in 2015 and 2020.<ref>[http://www.dailynews-tsn.com/page.php?id=7016 ''Daily News, Tanzania'': "500m/- set for Kigoma economic zone."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831080512/http://www.dailynews-tsn.com/page.php?id=7016 |date=2007-08-31 }} Monday, May 28, 2007. Retrieved 31 May 2007.</ref>

The ''[[MV Liemba]]'' sails every week from Kigoma to Mpulungu in Zambia at the southern tip of Lake Tanganyika, stopping at a number of other lakeside towns in Tanzania on the way. The ''MV Mwongozo'' sails from Kigoma to Baraka, Uvira and Bujumbura at the northern tip of the lake, although it is not working currently. There are other ships from Congo and Burundi that sail to Kigoma Port every week.

===Road===
Current road connections to and from Kigoma are improving. However, travellers should be advised to take extra precautions when travelling. A gravel road links the town northeast to the national road network, and earth tracks link north to Burundi and southeast to [[Sumbawanga]].<ref>Michelin Motoring and Tourist Map (2000): "No 955 Africa Central and South".

===Railway===
[[File:KIGOMA RAILWAY STATION.jpg|thumb|180px|The Kigoma rail station during the day time.]]
The [[Central Line (Tanzania)|Central Line]] of the [[Tanzania Railways Corporation]] runs from Kigoma to the [[Port of Dar es Salaam]] on to the [[Indian Ocean]] coast via [[Tabora]] and [[Dodoma]]. It was completed in 1915 when Kigoma was part of [[German East Africa]]. In [[Tabora]], there is a connection to [[Mwanza]] on Lake Victoria, with ferry connections to other Tanzanian lakeshore places, and formerly [[Uganda]]. At Tabora, you can also travel by train to Mpanda. For a time in early 2010, the line was closed<ref>''[[The Economist]]'', [http://www.economist.com/node/16646410 Burundi's election; Pretty squalid; East Africa’s weakest new component] Retrieved 24 July 2010</ref> but service has apparently been restored.<ref>''[[The Washington Post]]'', [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/24/AR2010092403675.html A train ride across Tanzania]  Retrieved 9 October 2010</ref>

===Airport===
The city is served by [[Kigoma Airport]] which has scheduled service to [[Bujumbura]] and [[Dar es Salaam]].
