==Name==

The oldest recorded name of the town is Polemonion ({{langx|grc|Πολεμώνιον}}, Latinized as Polemonium), after [[Polemon I of Pontus]]. A derivative of Polemonion, i.e. Bolaman, is the modern name of the river passing through Fatsa (the river is the ancient ''Sidenus'').<ref>{{Cite DGRG|title=Sidenus}}</ref> The present name, Fatsa, has been influenced by [[modern Greek]] Φάτσα or Φάτσα Πόντου (φἀτσα is derived from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''faccia''), which translates as "face or housefront on the sea", but has in fact mutated from Fanizan, the name of the daughter of King [[Pharnaces II of Pontus]], through Fanise, Phadisana ({{langx|el|Φαδισανή}}),<ref>Friedrich Heinrich Theodor Bischoff, Vergleichendes Wörterbuch der alten, mittleren und neuen Geographie, 1829</ref> Phadsane<ref>Richard J.

==History==
===Antiquity===

[[File:Dioecesis Pontica 400 AD.png|thumb|350px|right|The [[Diocese of Pontus]] and its provinces in c. 400 AD.]]
[[File:Ottoman Fatsa.png|thumb|350px|right|Fatsa, the late Ottoman era.]]
The history of Fatsa goes back to antiquity, when the coast was settled by [[Cimmerians]], and [[Pontic Greeks]] in the centuries BC. The ruins on Mount Çıngırt (the ancient rock tombs and vaults) are from this period.

===Roman and Byzantine periods===

Fatsa was first mentioned, in the era of the [[Kingdom of Pontus]], as ''Polemonium'', after King [[Polemon I of Pontus|Polemon I]], the Roman [[client state|client king]] appointed by [[Mark Antony]]. Under [[Nero]], the kingdom became a Roman province in AD 62. In about 295, [[Diocletian]] (r. 284–305) divided the province into three smaller provinces, one of which was [[Pontus Polemoniacus]], called after Polemonium, which was its administrative capital.

As the [[Roman Empire]] developed into the [[Byzantine Empire]], the city lost some of its regional importance. [[Neocaesarea]] became the capital of the province, and the [[Diocese of Polemonion]] was a [[suffragan]] of the [[metropolitan see]] of [[Neocaesarea (episcopal see)|Neocaesarea]].<ref name="OrthodoxCommunities">DIMITRI KOROBEINIKOV (2003): Orthodox Communities in Eastern Anatolia in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries.1 Part 1: The Two Patriarchates: Constantinople and Antioch, Al-Masaq: Islam and the Medieval Mediterranean, 15:2, 197-214</ref> Due to partition of the Byzantine Empire as a result of the [[Fourth Crusade]], Fatsa became a part of the [[Empire of Trebizond]] in 1204.

In the 13th and 14th centuries [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] traders established trading posts on the Black Sea coast.<ref>[http://blacksea.ehw.gr/Forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaID=11936 Rakova Snezhana, "Genoese in the Black Sea", ''Encyclopaedia of the Hellenic World, Black Sea'']</ref> Fatsa became one of the most important of these ports. There is a stone warehouse on the shore built in this period.

===Ottoman period===

Following the conquest of the Empire of Trebizond by the Ottomans in 1461, Fatsa become a part of [[Rûm Eyalet]] and later a part of [[Trebizond Eyalet]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and remained within the [[Sanjak of Janik]] until the collapse of the Empire in 1921. Fatsa
became a district of Ordu Province, following the formation of the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] in 1923.

Following the Turkish conquest of [[Anatolia]] by the [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]] and later by the Ottomans, Muslim settlers arrived at Fatsa in the middle of the 14th Century.<ref name="DavidWinfield">David Winfield et al., Some Byzantine Churches from the Pontus, Anatolian Studies, Vol. 12 (1962), pp. 131-161</ref> The early Muslim [[Turkish people|Turkish]] settlers included [[Turkmen people|Turkomens]], whose descendants make up the majority of Fatsa's current [[Alevi|Alevi Muslim]] community.<ref name="MorgKerem">Morgül Kerem, A History of Social Struggles in Fatsa 1960-1980, Boğaziçi University, 2007.</ref> In 1999, a religious worship complex that serves to both Alevis and [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] was opened in Fatsa, which was unprecedented in Turkey.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ordu.gov.tr/tr/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3506&Itemid=31 |title=T.C.

In the second half of the 19th century, Fatsa's [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] population increased significantly, as some of [[Chveneburi]] (Sunni Muslim [[Georgians]]) from [[Batumi]] and [[Kobuleti]] (Turkish: ''Çürüksu''), who fought in the Ottoman army against the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] forces in [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)]] under Ali Pasha of Çürüksu<ref name="Beratyildiz" /> and some of the [[Abazins]] and [[Circassians]],<ref name="DonaldPresgrave">Donald Presgrave Little et al., Islamic Studies Presented to Charles J. Adams, Brill Academic Pub; First Edition (April 1, 1991), {{ISBN|978-9004092211}}</ref> who were forced to leave their ancestral land in [[North Caucasus]] after the end of the [[Caucasian War]] in 1864, were settled in Fatsa and in the surrounding villages. The Circassian immigrants had an immediate impact on the local economy by introducing silk production to the area.  In 1868, 3 million [[piastre]]s worth of silk was sold in Fatsa.<ref name="DonaldPresgrave" />

During the Byzantine period, as early as the 9th century, an [[Orthodoxy#Christianity|Orthodox]] [[diocese]] was located in Fatsa (''Diocese of Polemonion'').<ref name="OrthodoxCommunities" /> Fatsa's  [[Christianity|Christian]] population during the Ottoman era was made up by [[Pontic Greeks]] and [[Armenians]],<ref>Léon Maccas, L’Hellenisme de L’Asie – Mineure, Paris, 1919, s: 83.</ref> who thrived as craftsmen and bureaucrats. According to the last Ottoman census carried out in 1914, the Christians made up 12% of Fatsa's total population of 40,339.<ref>Meir Zamir (1981): Population statistics of the Ottoman empire in 1914 and 1919, Middle Eastern Studies, 17:1, 85-106</ref><ref>Tableaux indiquant le nombre des divers elements de la population dans l'Empire Ottoman au 1 Mars 1330 (14 Mars 1914), Constantinople</ref> After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Fatsa's Christian population diminished. The last Pontic Greek community left Fatsa in 1923 as a part of the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], when 770 Muslim families from [[Thessaloniki]], [[Greece]] were settled in Fatsa and the indigenous [[Pontic Greek]] population of Fatsa were settled in [[Katerini]] and in the village of [[:el:Τρίλοφος Πιερίας|Trilofos Himachal]], both in the [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]] region of [[Greece]]. Two members of Fatsa's Pontic Greek community, after the population exchange in 1923, became politicians in Greece; [[:el:Αλέξανδρος Δεληγιαννίδης|Alexander Deligiannidis]], born in Fatsa in 1914 served in the Greek Parliament as a member of [[National Radical Union|National Radical Union Party]] (1956 - 1964) and  [[:el:Τάκης Τερζόπουλος|Takis Terzopoulos]], born in Fatsa in 1920 served as the mayor of Katerini (1964 - 1967).

The book titled ''Literary Publications, Testimonials and Narratives in Pieria (1918 - 2010)'' (Greek: ''Λογοτεχνικές εκδόσεις, μαρτυρίες και αφηγήσεις στην Πιερία'')  includes chronicles of some of Fatsa's Pontic Greeks on their exodus from Fatsa to Katerini, including an anecdotal account by Chalkidis Ef. Theophilus (Greek: Χαλκίδης Ευθ. Θεόφιλος)  (b. Fatsa in 1900 - d. Katerini 1985).<ref name="Isbn" />

In 1919, in Fatsa, there were 8 churches ([[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]], [[Greek Evangelical Church|Greek Evangelical]] and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]]) served by 9 priests.<ref>Maccas, Léon, L'hellénisme de l'Asie-Mineure son histoire, sa puissance (1919)</ref> After the departure of the last Christian community in 1923, the churches were closed and later demolished.<ref name="DavidWinfield" /> The last remaining church in Fatsa was in town's Kurtuluş District and was demolished in the late 1980s.

==Politics==
===Social Unrest in 1970s - 1980s===

During the social unrest in Turkey in the 1970s, a major international incident in the area was the kidnapping of three [[NATO]] engineers (two [[United Kingdom|British]], one [[Canadians|Canadian]]) from the [[Ünye]] radar station in 1972 by the members of [[People's Liberation Army of Turkey]],<ref>San Mateo Times /Thursday, March 30, 1972 /Page-1</ref> which had a support base in Fatsa.

In 1976, [[Nazmiye Komitoğlu]] was elected as the mayor of Fatsa, who was the first female mayor elected in the Black Sea region of Turkey. Following her death in office,<ref name="Engbozkurt">ENGİN BOZKURT, THE CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT EXPERIENCES IN TURKEY: THE CASE OF HOZAT MUNICIPALITY, MIDDLE EAST TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY, 2011</ref> [[Fikri Sönmez]], a local [[Georgians in Turkey|Chveneburi]],<ref name="MorgKerem" /> was elected as the mayor on 14 October 1979.<ref>TÜRKMEN, HADE, RADICALISATION OF POLITICS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL: THE CASE OF FATSA DURING THE LATE 1970s, MIDDLE EAST TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY, 2006</ref> Sönmez and his [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] organisation [[Devrimci Yol]], which was made up by local committees under the slogan "The red sun will rise in Fatsa",  controlled the municipality until 11 July 1980.<ref>SÜMERCAN BOZKURT, THE RESISTANCE COMMITTEES: DEVRIMCI YOL AND THE QUESTION OF REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION IN TURKEY IN THE LATE 1970s, MIDDLE EAST TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY, 2008</ref>

After his election as the mayor, Sönmez divided Fatsa into eleven regions and created people's committees, which had power to recall government authorities.<ref name="Engbozkurt" /> Sönmez was blamed creating a new state inside the Turkish Republic by the prime minister of Turkey at the time, [[Süleyman Demirel]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uludagsozluk.com/k/fatsa-nokta-operasyonu/|title = Fatsa nokta operasyonu}}</ref>

This era ended when, upon the initiative of the [[Nationalist Movement Party]] supporting the provincial governor, the
[[Turkish military]] conducted an operation called OperationTarget (Turkish: ''Nokta Operasyonu'') against the town.<ref>{{cite web|title=Milliyet - Ece Temelkuran - Teferruat!|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/Yazar.aspx?aType=YazarDetay&ArticleID=1002055&AuthorID=60&Date=12.10.2008|language=tr|access-date=12 November 2008}}</ref>
On 8 July 1980, the [[Turkish Army]] surrounded Fatsa. On 9 July the [[General Staff of the Republic of Turkey|General Staff of Turkish Armed Forces]], General [[Kenan Evren]] arrived at Fatsa. On 11 July 1980, the army moved into the town, and Mayor Sönmez and 300 others were arrested by the army.<ref name="MorgKerem" /> OperationTarget is believed to be the rehearsal for the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état]] led by Gen. Kenan Evren.<ref>"Bir Yerel Yönetim Deneyi" by [[Pertev Aksakal]] (Simge Yayınevi) 1989</ref>

Throughout this turbulent period, Fatsa lost a significant number of its people as they migrated away to jobs in Turkey's larger cities or abroad. Immigrants from Fatsa constitute the largest proportion of the Turkish community in [[Japan]].<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://arsiv.sabah.com.tr/2005/10/01/cp/gnc105-20050925-102.html | title=Fatsalı'nın ikinci vatanı Japonya| access-date= 2009-02-24| date=2005-10-01| periodical=Sabah| language=tr }}</ref>

===Current===

The current mayor of Fatsa is İbrahim Etem Kibar from the conservative [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AK Party]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fatsa.bel.tr/sayfa/baskanin-ozgecmisi |title=Başkan'ın Özgeçmişi |access-date=9 October 2023}}</ref>

==Economy==

The local economy depends on agriculture and fishing. In the early 20th century, the town thrived as a port and trading post, as there was no coastal road to in the region. There are fishing fleets harboured at the port in Fatsa and in the small districts of Yalıköy and [[Bolaman]] (''Polemonium'') and in the hamlet of Belice, which forms a natural harbour. The [[State road D010 (Turkey)|Black Sea Coastal Highway]] runs through Fatsa bringing passing trade.

Before the 20th century, [[maize]] and [[rice]] were the main grains grown in the hinterland. From the 1920s onwards, the coastal swamps were dried up by irrigation works, rice growing ceased and the town grew. During this time, hazelnuts were introduced to the area. About 80% of arable land is planted with [[Corylus avellana|hazelnuts]]. The higher mountain areas of the district are covered in forest.

==Places of interest==
