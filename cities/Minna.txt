Christianity is the second most practiced religion in the city . Popular churches include the [[Faith Church]], [[Grace Baptist Church]], [[Nupe Kalvari Church]]es, [[Anglican Church]]es, [[Evangelical Church Winning All|ECWA churches]], [[Baptist Church|Baptist church]]es, [[Victory Christian Church]], the [[Apostolic Christian Church|Apostolic Church]] and many others.<ref>{{Cite web |title=List Of Churches in Minna {{!}} SmartScrapers |url=https://rentechdigital.com/smartscraper/business-report-details/nigeria/niger-state/minna/churches |access-date=2024-07-05 |website=SmartScraper |language=en}}</ref>

== Pollution ==
Based on research carried out, it was reported that Minna is being affected by [[land pollution]] caused by non-proper disposal of solid waste products. This has cause several disease such as Malaria fever, Yellow fever, Lassa  fever, etc.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Christopher Ileanwa |first=Abdul |last2=Macaulay Atahchegbe |first2=Egwuma |last3=Andrew Ekule |first3=Adejoh |date=2020-06-01 |title=Impact of land pollution on the wellbeing of neighborhoods in Minna Metropolis of Nigeria |url=http://www.cas-press.com/article_111257.html |journal=Central Asian Journal of Environmental Science and Technology Innovation |language=en |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=143–149 |doi=10.22034/CAJESTI.2020.03.03 |issn=2717-4034}}</ref>
==Climate==
Minna has a typical [[Middle Belt]] [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Aw'') with two seasons: an arid, dusty, [[harmattan]]-dominate [[dry season]] from November to April and a humid, oppressive [[wet season]] dominated by monsoonal air masses from May to October. Temperatures are hot to sweltering year round, except at the height of the wet season when air temperatures are merely very warm but the high humidity makes it equally or more uncomfortable than the hotter dry season. Due to the monsoon, summer (June, July, August) is cooler than spring, fall and winter.
