'''Nairobi''' ({{IPAc-en|n|aɪ|ˈ|r|oʊ|b|i}} {{respell|ny|ROH|bee}}) is the [[Capital city|capital]] and largest city of [[Kenya]]. The name is derived from the [[Maasai language|Maasai]] phrase {{Lang|mas|Enkare Nairobi}}, which translates to 'place of cool waters', a reference to the [[Nairobi River]] which flows through the city. The [[city proper]] had a population of 4,397,073 in the 2019 census.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Kenya Central Bureau of Statistics |url=https://www.knbs.or.ke/?wpdmpro=2019-kenya-population-and-housing-census-volume-i-population-by-county-and-sub-county |title=2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census Volume I: Population by County and Sub-County |access-date=7 November 2019 |archive-date=13 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191113191208/https://www.knbs.or.ke/?wpdmpro=2019-kenya-population-and-housing-census-volume-i-population-by-county-and-sub-county |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |url=https://www.isocarp.net/Data/case_studies/1662.pdf |title=Nairobi Emerging Metropolitan Region Development Planning and Management Opportunities and Challenges |last1=Omwenga |first1=Mairura |date=2010-09-19 |book-title=ISOCARP CONGRESS |pages=1–5 |location=Nairobi |conference=46th ISOCARP Congress |access-date=17 November 2022 |archive-date=17 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221117155909/https://www.isocarp.net/Data/case_studies/1662.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> The city is commonly referred to as 'The Green City in the Sun'.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pulse Africa |title=Not to be Missed: Nairobi 'Green City in the Sun' |publisher=pulseafrica.com |url=http://www.pulseafrica.com/Highlights_1110000000_1_Nairobi+Green+City+In+The+Sun.htm |access-date=14 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428205948/http://www.pulseafrica.com/Highlights_1110000000_1_Nairobi%2BGreen%2BCity%2BIn%2BThe%2BSun.htm |archive-date=28 April 2007 }}</ref>

Nairobi is home of the [[Parliament Buildings (Kenya)|Kenyan Parliament Buildings]] and hosts thousands of Kenyan businesses and key international companies and organisations, including the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UN Environment) and the [[United Nations Office at Nairobi]] (UNON). Nairobi is an established hub for business and culture. The [[Nairobi Securities Exchange]] (NSE) is one of the largest [[Stock exchange|stock exchanges]] in Africa and the second-oldest exchange on the continent. It is Africa's fourth-largest stock exchange in terms of trading volume, capable of making 10 million trades a day. It also contains the [[Nairobi National Park]]. Nairobi joined the [[UNESCO]] Global Network of Learning Cities in 2010.

Nairobi was founded in 1899 by colonial authorities in [[British East Africa]], as a rail depot on the [[Uganda#Railroad|Uganda]] - [[Rail transport in Kenya|Kenya Railway.]] It was favoured by the authorities as an ideal resting place due to its [[Montane ecosystems|high elevation]], [[temperate climate]], and adequate water supply.<ref name="Greenway2">Roger S.

===Early years===
[[File:Nairobi 18 99.jpg|thumb|right|Nairobi in 1899]]
The site of Nairobi was originally a swamp land occupied by a [[Pastoralism|pastoralist]] people, the [[Maasai people|Maasai]], the sedentary [[Kamba people|Akamba People]], as well as the [[agriculturalist]] [[Kikuyu people]].<ref name="ReferenceB">Donald B. Freeman, City of Farmers: Informal Urban Agriculture in the Open Spaces of Nairobi, Kenya, McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 1 Mar 1991</ref> The name Nairobi itself comes from the [[Maasai language|Maasai]] expression meaning 'cool waters', referring to the cold water stream which flowed through the area.<ref>Frédéric Landy, From Urban National Parks to Natured Cities in the Global South: The Quest for Naturbanity, Springer, 20 Jul 2018, p.50</ref> With the arrival of the [[Uganda Railway]], the site was identified by [[George Whitehouse|Sir George Whitehouse]] for a store depot, shunting ground and camping ground for the [[Indians in Kenya|Indian]] labourers working on the railway. Whitehouse, chief engineer of the railway, favoured the site as an ideal resting place due to its high elevation, temperate climate, adequate water supply and being situated before the steep ascent of the [[Limuru]] [[escarpments]].<ref name="Anne-Marie Deisser 2016, p.76">Anne-Marie Deisser, Mugwima Njuguna, Conservation of Natural and Cultural Heritage in Kenya, UCL Press, 7 Oct 2016, p.76</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=United Nations University |title=Nairobi: National capital and regional hub |publisher=unu.edu |url=http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/uu26ue/uu26ue0o.htm |access-date=17 June 2007 |archive-date=9 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609014131/http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/uu26ue/uu26ue0o.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> His choice was however criticised by officials within the [[East Africa Protectorate|Protectorate]] government who felt the site was too flat, poorly drained and relatively infertile.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>
[[File:The entrance to the Nairobi Railway Station in 1899.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance to Nairobi railway station in 1899]] During the pre-colonial era, the people of modern Kenya mostly lived in villages amongst their tribes and cultural groups, where they had rulers within their communities rather than one singular government or leader.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tignor |first1=Robert L. |title=Colonial Chiefs in Chiefless Societies |journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies |date=1971 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=339–359 |doi=10.1017/S0022278X00025131 |jstor=159669 |s2cid=154551781 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/159669 |access-date=September 28, 2020 |archive-date=7 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220407205902/https://www.jstor.org/stable/159669 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1898, Arthur Church was first and foremost commissioned to design the first town layout for the railway depot. It constituted two streets – [[Tom Mboya Street|Victoria Street]] and [[Moi Avenue (Nairobi)|Station Street]], ten avenues, staff quarters and an Indian commercial area.<ref name="Anne-Marie Deisser 2016, p.76"/> The railway arrived at Nairobi on 30 May 1899, and soon Nairobi replaced Machakos as the headquarters of the provincial administration for the Ukamba province.<ref>Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 303</ref><ref>The Eastern Africa Journal of Historical and Social Sciences Research, Volume 1, Indiana University, 8 Publishers, 1996</ref> On the arrival of the railway, Whitehouse remarked that "Nairobi itself will in the course of the next two years become a large and flourishing place and already there are many applications for sites for hotels, shops and houses."<ref name="Anne-Marie Deisser 2016, p.76"/> The town's early years were however beset with problems of [[malaria]] leading to at least one attempt to have the town moved.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2009/12/the-inconvenient-truth-about-malaria/|title=The inconvenient truth about malaria|last=Reiter|first=Paul|date=5 December 2009|work=Spectator|access-date=25 July 2016|archive-date=18 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160218091605/http://www.spectator.co.uk/2009/12/the-inconvenient-truth-about-malaria/|url-status=live}}</ref> In the early 1900s, Bazaar Street (now Biashara Street) was completely rebuilt after an outbreak of [[Bubonic plague|plague]] and the burning of the original town.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://owaahh.com/meet-the-man-who-saved-nairobi-from-the-bubonic-plague/|title=The man who saved Nairobi from the Bubonic Plague – Owaahh|date=16 April 2014|work=Owaahh|access-date=19 January 2018|language=en-US|archive-date=20 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120065811/http://owaahh.com/meet-the-man-who-saved-nairobi-from-the-bubonic-plague/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Between 1902 and 1910, the town's population rose from 5,000 to 16,000 and grew around [[Public administration|administration]] and tourism, initially in the form of [[big game hunting]].<ref name="Sana Aiyar 2015, p.42">Sana Aiyar, Indians in Kenya: The Politics of Diaspora, Harvard University Press, 2015, p.42</ref> In 1907, Nairobi replaced [[Mombasa]] as the capital of the East Africa Protectorate.<ref>Claire C.

And it is fair to say that the Government and the Municipality have already bravely tackled the problem and that a town-plan ambitious enough to turn Nairobi into a thing of beauty has been slowly worked out, and much has already been done.

===Post independence===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Zicht op Nairobi met op de voorgrond het stadspark met tribune TMnr 20014416.jpg|thumb|250px|Nairobi in 1973]]
Nairobi remained the capital of Kenya after independence, and its continued rapid growth put pressure on the city's infrastructure with power cuts and [[Water scarcity|water shortages]] becoming a common occurrence.

On 11 September 1973, the [[Kenyatta International Conference Centre]] KICC was open to the public. The 28-storey building at the time was designed by the Norwegian architect Karl Henrik Nøstvik and Kenyan David Mutiso. It is the only building within the city with a helipad that is open to the public. Of the buildings built in the Seventies, the KICC was the most eco-friendly and most environmentally conscious structure; its main frame was constructed with locally available materials gravel, sand, cement and wood, and it had wide open spaces which allowed for natural aeration and natural lighting. Cuboids made up the plenary hall, the tower consisted of a cylinder composed of several cuboids, and the amphitheater and helipad both resembled cones. The tower was built around a concrete core and it had no walls but glass windows, which allowed for maximum natural lighting. It had the largest halls in eastern and central Africa.<ref>[http://kicc.co.ke/about/ourhistory "Our History"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307001156/http://kicc.co.ke/about/ourhistory |date=7 March 2017 }}, The Kenyatta International Convention Centre.</ref>

A year prior in 1972, the [[World Bank]] approved funds for further expansion of the then Nairobi Airport (now [[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]]), including a new international and domestic passenger terminal building, the airport's first dedicated cargo and freight terminal, new taxiways, associated aprons, internal roads, car parks, police and fire stations, a State Pavilion, airfield and roadway lighting, fire hydrant system, water, electrical, telecommunications and sewage systems, a dual carriageway passenger access road, security, drainage and the building of the main access road to the airport (Airport South Road). The total cost of the project was more than US$29 million (US$111.8 million in 2013 dollars).<ref name="nairobiairport">{{cite web | title=Nairobi Airport Project | url=http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P001235/nairobi-airport-project?lang=en | publisher=The World Bank | access-date=7 August 2013 | archive-date=17 March 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317022637/http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P001235/nairobi-airport-project?lang=en | url-status=live }}</ref> On 14 March 1978, construction of the terminal building was completed on the other side of the airport's single runway and opened by President [[Jomo Kenyatta]] less than five months before his death. The airport was renamed [[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]] in memory of its first president.

The [[Giraffe Centre]], an animal sanctuary on the southwestern outskirts of Nairobi, was opened in 1983. To this day, it breeds the endangered species of [[Rothschild's giraffe]].

The United States Embassy, then located in downtown Nairobi, was bombed in August 1998 by [[Al-Qaeda]] and the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]], as one of a series of [[1998 United States embassy bombings|US embassy bombings]]. It is now the site of a memorial park.<ref>{{cite web |last=United States Embassy |title=Quiet Memorials Mark Fourth Anniversary of Embassy Bombing |publisher=usembassy.gov |url=http://www.usembassy.gov/nairobi/wwwhrann.html |access-date=17 June 2007 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

On 20 October 2011, a memorial statue was unveiled in Nairobi in memory to [[Tom Mboya]], a former Kenyan Independence politician and assassination victim.

On 9 November 2012, President [[Mwai Kibaki]] opened the KES 31 billion Thika Superhighway. This mega-project of Kenya started in 2009 and ended in 2011. It involved expanding the four-lane carriageway to eight lanes, building underpasses, providing interchanges at roundabouts, erecting flyovers and building underpasses to ease congestion. The 50.4-kilometre road was built in three phases: Uhuru Highway to Muthaiga Roundabout; Muthaiga Roundabout to [[Kenyatta University]] and; Kenyatta University to [[Thika Town Constituency|Thika Town]].<ref>[http://www.nation.co.ke/news/Kibaki-to-officially-open-Sh30bn-Thika-superhighway/1056-1612572-eg30pcz/index.html "Kibaki to officially open Sh30bn Thika superhighway"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510145843/http://www.nation.co.ke/news/Kibaki-to-officially-open-Sh30bn-Thika-superhighway/1056-1612572-eg30pcz/index.html |date=10 May 2017 }}, ''The Nation'', 5 November 2012.</ref>

On 31 May 2017, President [[Uhuru Kenyatta]] inaugurated the Standard Gauge Railway which connects Nairobi to Mombasa.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kenya inaugurates new Chinese-funded railway |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/5/31/kenya-inaugurates-new-chinese-funded-railway |access-date=2023-06-08 |website=www.aljazeera.com |language=en |archive-date=9 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230609005539/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/5/31/kenya-inaugurates-new-chinese-funded-railway |url-status=live }}</ref> It was primarily built by a Chinese firm with about 90% of total funding from China and about 10% from the Kenyan government. A second phase is also being built which will link [[Naivasha]] to the existing route and also the [[Uganda]] border.

==Geography==

[[File:Nairobi, Kenya.JPG|thumb|left|Satellite view of Nairobi]]

The city is situated at {{Coord|1|09|S|36|39|E|display=inline|name=Nairobi, Kenya}} and {{Coord|1|27|S|37|06|E|display=inline|name=Nairobi, Kenya}} and occupies {{convert|696|km2|sqmi|-1}}.

Nairobi is situated between the cities of Kampala and Mombasa. As Nairobi is adjacent to the eastern edge of the [[Kenya Rift Valley|Rift Valley]], minor earthquakes and tremors occasionally occur. The [[Ngong Hills]], located to the west of the city, are the most prominent geographical feature of the Nairobi area. [[Mount Kenya]] is situated north of Nairobi, and [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] is towards the south-east.<ref>{{cite web |last=Perceptive Travel |title=Nairobi by Degrees |publisher=perceptivetravel.com |url=http://www.perceptivetravel.com/issues/0506/hein.htm |access-date=14 June 2007 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

The [[Nairobi River]] and its [[Tributary|tributaries]] traverse through the Nairobi County and joins the larger River Athi on the eastern edge of the county.
[[File:River Athi.jpg|thumb|River Athi on the eastern side of Nairobi]]
[[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Wangari Maathai]] fought fiercely to save the indigenous [[Karura Forest]] in northern Nairobi which was under threat of being replaced by housing and other infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web |last=The East African |title=Karura: Are We Missing the Trees for the Forest? |publisher=nationmedia.com |date=2 November 1998 |url=http://www.nationaudio.com/News/EastAfrican/0211/Opinion/Opinion3.html |access-date=14 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927014609/http://www.nationaudio.com/News/EastAfrican/0211/Opinion/Opinion3.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=27 September 2007}}</ref>

Nairobi's western suburbs stretch all the way from the Kenyatta National Hospital in the south to the UN headquarters at Gigiri suburb in the north, a distance of about {{convert|20|km|mi|0}}. The city is centred on the City Square, which is located in the Central Business District. The [[National Assembly of Kenya|Kenyan Parliament]] buildings, the [[Cathedral Basilica of the Holy Family, Nairobi|Holy Family Cathedral]], Nairobi City Hall, Nairobi Law Courts, and the [[Kenyatta International Convention Centre|Kenyatta Convention Centre]] all surround the square.
[[File:Rain clouds forming Nairobi.jpg|thumb|Rain clouds over estates (Dec. 2019).]]

===Climate===
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Nairobi has a [[Oceanic climate|subtropical highland climate]] (Cwb). At {{convert|1795|m|ft|0}} above sea level, evenings may be cool, especially in the June/July season, when the temperature can drop to {{convert|9|C|F|0}}. The sunniest and warmest part of the year is from December to March, when temperatures average in the high-twenties [[Celsius]] during the day. The mean maximum temperature for this period is {{convert|28|C|F|0}}.<ref>{{cite web |last=United Nations |title=Travel and Visa Information |publisher=unhabitat.org |url=http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?typeid=19&catid=546&cid=4939 |access-date=20 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927034058/http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?typeid=19&catid=546&cid=4939 |archive-date=27 September 2007 }}</ref>

There are rainy seasons, but rainfall can be moderate. The cloudiest part of the year is just after the first rainy season, when, until September, conditions are usually overcast with drizzle. As Nairobi is situated close to the equator, the differences between the seasons are minimal. The seasons are referred to as the [[wet season]] and [[dry season]]. The timing of sunrise and sunset varies little throughout the year for the same reason.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gaisma |title=Nairobi, Kenya – Sunrise, sunset, dawn and dusk times, table |publisher=gaisma.com |url=http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/nairobi.html |access-date=22 June 2007 |archive-date=3 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303001001/http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/nairobi.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Districts and neighbourhoods===
[[File:Nairobi South.jpg|thumb|left|Nairobi southern suburbs in 2003]]
Nairobi is divided into a series of constituencies with each being represented by members of Parliament in the National Assembly. The initial constituencies before the 2010 constitution which led to the county electoral boundaries being redrawn were: Makadara, Kamukunji, Starehe, [[Langata]], Dagoretti, [[Westlands, Nairobi|Westlands]], Kasarani, and [[Embakasi]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Nairobi City Council |title=Councillors, Wards & Constituencies |publisher=nairobicity.org |url=http://www.nairobicity.org/departments/councillors.asp?search=%25&page=1 |access-date=20 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070327052635/http://www.nairobicity.org/departments/councillors.asp?search=%25&page=1 |archive-date=27 March 2007 }}</ref> The new electoral boundaries after this were revised to Embakasi North, Embakasi South, Embakasi Central, Embakasi East, Embakasi West, Makadara, Kamukunji, Starehe, Mathare, Westlands, Dagoretti North, Dagoretti South, Langata, Kibra, Ruaraka, Roysambu and Kasarani. The main administrative divisions of Nairobi are Central, Dagoretti, [[Embakasi]], Kasarani, [[Kibera]], Makadara, Pumwani, and [[Westlands, Nairobi|Westlands]]. Most of the upmarket suburbs are situated to the west and north-central of Nairobi, where most European settlers resided during the colonial times AKA 'Ubabini'.<ref>{{cite web |last=Nairobi City Council |title=Living in Nairobi |publisher=nairobicity.org |url=http://www.nairobicity.org/articles/default.asp?search=living |access-date=20 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319092940/http://www.nairobicity.org/articles/default.asp?search=living |archive-date=19 March 2007 }}</ref> These include [[Karen, Kenya|Karen]], [[Langata]], [[Lavington, Nairobi|Lavington]], [[Gigiri]], [[Muthaiga]], Brookside, Spring Valley, Loresho, [[Kilimani]], Kileleshwa, Hurlingham, [[Runda]], [[Kitisuru]], Nyari, Kyuna, [[Lower Kabete]], [[Westlands, Nairobi|Westlands]], and [[Highridge]], although Kangemi, Kawangware, and [[Dagoretti]] are lower income areas close to these affluent suburbs. The city's colonial past is commemorated by many English place-names.

Most lower-middle and upper middle income neighbourhoods are located in the north-central areas such as Highridge, Parklands, Ngara, Pangani, and areas to the southwest and southeast of the metropolitan area near the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The most notable ones include Avenue Park, Fedha, Pipeline, Donholm, Greenfields, Nyayo, Taasia, Baraka, Nairobi West, Madaraka, Siwaka, South B, South C, Mugoya, Riverbank, Hazina, Buru Buru, Uhuru, Harambee Civil Servants', Akiba, Kimathi, Pioneer, and Koma Rock to the centre-east and Kasarani to northeast area among others. The low and lower income estates are located mainly in far eastern Nairobi. These include, Umoja, Kariokor, [[Dandora]], [[Kariobangi]], [[Kayole]], [[Ruai]], [[Kamulu]], [[Embakasi]], and [[Huruma]]. Kitengela suburb, though located further southeast, Ongata Rongai and Kiserian further southwest, and Ngong/Embulbul suburbs also known as 'Diaspora' to the far west are considered part of the Greater Nairobi Metropolitan area. More than 90% of Nairobi residents work within the Nairobi Metropolitan area, in the formal and informal sectors. Many [[Somali people|Somali]] immigrants have also settled in [[Eastleigh, Nairobi|Eastleigh]], nicknamed "Little [[Mogadishu]]".<ref>{{cite web|last=Monsters and Critics |title=Urban Somali refugees call Nairobi's "Little Mogadishu" home |publisher=news.monstersandcritics.com |url=http://news.monstersandcritics.com/africa/features/article_1233394.php/Urban_Somali_refugees_call_Nairobis_little_Mogadishu_home |access-date=20 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617144406/http://news.monstersandcritics.com/africa/features/article_1233394.php/Urban_Somali_refugees_call_Nairobis_little_Mogadishu_home |archive-date=17 June 2007 }}</ref> Here is the list of all [https://nashthuo.com/nairobi-postal-code/ postal codes for Nairobi] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230319204025/https://nashthuo.com/nairobi-postal-code/ |date=19 March 2023 }}.

===Parks and gardens===
[[File:Central park .jpg|thumb|Central Park]]
[[File:West Nairobi CBD.jpg|thumb|left|Kenyatta Avenue with [[Uhuru Park]] between [[Upper Hill, Nairobi|Upper Hill]] and the Nairobi CBD]]

Nairobi has many parks and open spaces throughout the city. Much of the city has dense tree-cover and plenty of green spaces. The most famous park in Nairobi is [[Uhuru Park]]. The park borders the central business district and the neighbourhood Upper Hill. Uhuru (''Freedom'' in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]) Park is a centre for outdoor speeches, services, and rallies. The park was to be built over by former President [[Daniel arap Moi]], who wanted the 62-storey headquarters of his party, the [[Kenya African National Union]], situated in the park.<ref>{{cite web |last=The Standard |title=Kenyans must have a sustained campaign against land grabbing |publisher=eastandard.net |url=http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/hm_news/news_s.php?articleid=4451&date=30/10/2004 |access-date=25 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113092330/http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/hm_news/news_s.php?articleid=4451&date=30%2F10%2F2004 |archive-date=13 January 2015 }}</ref> However, the park was saved following a campaign by [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Wangarĩ Maathai|Wangari Maathai]].

Central Park is adjacent to Uhuru Park, and includes a memorial for [[Jomo Kenyatta]], the first president of Kenya, and the Moi Monument, built in 1988 to commemorate the second president's first decade in power. Other notable open spaces include [[Jeevanjee Gardens]], City Park, [[August 7th Memorial Park, Kenya|7 August Memorial Park]], and Nairobi Arboretum.

The colonial 1948 Master Plan for Nairobi still acts as the governing mechanism when it comes to making decisions related to urban planning. The Master Plan at the time, which was designed for 250,000 people, allocated 28% of Nairobi's land to public space, but because of rapid population growth, much of the vitality of public spaces within the city are increasingly threatened.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Makworo|first1=Micah|last2=Mireri|first2=Caleb|date=1 October 2011|title=Public open spaces in Nairobi City, Kenya, under threat|journal=Journal of Environmental Planning and Management|volume=54|issue=8|pages=1107–1123|doi=10.1080/09640568.2010.549631|bibcode=2011JEPM...54.1107M |s2cid=55840153|issn=0964-0568|url=https://ir-library.ku.ac.ke/bitstream/123456789/7836/4/Public%20open%20spaces%20in%20Nairobi%20City%20Kenya%20under%20threat.pdf}}{{Dead link|date=August 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> City Park, the only natural park in Nairobi, for example, was originally {{cvt|150|acre|disp=flip|-1}}, but has since lost approximately {{cvt|50|acre|disp=flip|-1}} of land to private development through squatting and illegal alienation which began in the 1980s.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://nairobicarrentals.com/|title=Nairobi Car Rentals|work=Nairobi City|access-date=10 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222112607/http://nairobicarrentals.com/|archive-date=22 February 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Political divisions==
[[File:Co-operative Bank of Kenya.jpg|thumb|Co-operative Bank of Kenya headquarters.]]
The City of Nairobi enjoys the status of a full [[Counties of Kenya|administrative county]].

Initially, Nairobi was one of the eight provinces in Kenya before 2013. The Nairobi province differed in several ways from other Kenyan regions. Nairobi Province was not divided into "districts" until 2007, when three districts were created. In 2010, along with the new constitution, Nairobi was renamed a county and consolidated into a [[List of cities and towns in Kenya by population|city-county]]. The county is entirely urban. It had only one local council, [[Nairobi City Council]] which was replaced by [[Nairobi City County]] after the new constitution was effected in March 2013.

Nairobi County has 17 constituencies. Constituency name may differ from division name, such that Starehe Constituency is equal to Central Division, Lang'ata Constituency to Kibera division, and Kamukunji Constituency to Pumwani Division in terms of boundaries.

===Constituencies===
[[File:Kenyatta International Conference Centre.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kenyatta International Convention Centre]] with [[Times Tower]] in the background]]
Nairobi is divided into 17 [[Divisions of Kenya|constituencies]] and 85 [[Locations of Kenya|wards]],<ref name="test">[http://www.iebc.or.ke/index.php/resources/downloads/item/final-constituencies-and-wards-description] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319001043/http://www.iebc.or.ke/index.php/resources/downloads/item/final-constituencies-and-wards-description|date=19 March 2013}}</ref> mostly named after residential estates. Kibera Division, for example, includes [[Kibera]] (Kenya's largest slum) as well as affluent estates of [[Karen, Kenya|Karen]] and [[Langata]].

===Central business district and skyline===
{{wide image|Kenyatta Avenue Panorama.jpg|1100px|align-cap=center|Panorama of Kenyatta Avenue, Nairobi CBD's main street}}
Nairobi has grown around its [[central business district]]. This takes a pentagonal shape, around the Uhuru Highway, Haile Selassie Avenue, Moi Avenue, and University Way. It features many of Nairobi's important buildings, including the City Hall and Parliament Building. The city square is also located within the perimeter.

Most of the skyscrapers in this region are the headquarters of businesses and corporations, such as I&M and the [[Kenyatta International Conference Centre]]. The [[1998 United States embassy bombings|United States Embassy bombing]] took place in this district, prompting the building of a new embassy building in the suburbs.

In 2011, the city was considered to have about 4 million residents. A large beautification project took place in the Central Business District, as the city prepared to host the 2006 Afri-Cities summit. Iconic buildings such as the [[Kenyatta International Conference Centre]] had their exteriors cleaned and repainted.<ref>{{cite web |last=Nairobi City Council |title=The Beautification of Nairobi City Project |publisher=nairobicity.org |url=http://www.nairobicity.org/projects/projects_full_story.asp?search=beautif |access-date=28 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127180059/http://www.nairobicity.org/projects/projects_full_story.asp?search=beautif |archive-date=27 January 2007 }}</ref>

To accommodate the large demand for floor space in Nairobi, various commercial projects are being constructed. New business parks are being built in the city, including the flagship [[Nairobi Business Park]].

  text:Population of Nairobi City
</timeline>
}}

Nairobi has experienced one of the highest growth rates of any city in Africa. Since its foundation in 1899, Nairobi has grown to become the second largest city in the African Great Lakes, despite being one of youngest cities in the region. The growth rate of Nairobi was estimated in 2023 to be 2.09% a year.<ref>{{cite web |title=The World Factbook |url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/kenya/ |access-date=13 April 2024 |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |archive-date=8 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230308161149/https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/kenya/ |url-status=live }}</ref> It is estimated that Nairobi's population will reach 5 million people in 2025.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/print/news.php?articleid=26125 |title=Build cities to contain population explosion |last=Oronje |first=Rose |date=July 27, 2005 |work=The Standard |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927174509/http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/print/news.php?articleid=26125 |archive-date=27 September 2007}}</ref>

Given this high population growth, owing itself both to urban migration and high birth rates, the economy has yet to catch up. Unemployment is estimated at 5.5% within the city,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kenya - unemployment rate 1999-2022 |url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/808608/unemployment-rate-in-kenya/ |access-date=2024-03-07 |website=Statista |language=en |archive-date=5 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200805060723/https://www.statista.com/statistics/808608/unemployment-rate-in-kenya/ |url-status=live }}</ref> mainly in the high-density, low income areas of the city which can make them seem even denser than the higher-income neighbourhoods.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Oyugi|first1=Maurice Onyango|last2=K’Akumu|first2=Owiti A.|title=Land use management challenges for the city of Nairobi|journal=Urban Forum|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=94–113|doi=10.1007/BF02681232|issn=1015-3802|year=2007|s2cid=154635614}}</ref>

According to the 2019 Census, Christianity is the most widely practiced religion in Nairobi, accounting for 89% of the population, of which the majority belong to Protestant and Evangelical churches. Muslims make up a significant minority at 7.6% of the population.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/kenya/admin/nairobi/47__nairobi/ |title=Religion, Nairobi: Census 2019 |publisher=citypopulation.com |access-date=13 July 2023 |archive-date=12 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230712232104/https://www.citypopulation.de/en/kenya/admin/nairobi/47__nairobi/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Parks ==
[[File:A lone giraffe in Nairobi National Park.jpg|thumb|A giraffe at [[Nairobi National Park]], with Nairobi's skyline in background]]

Nairobi has numerous recreational green areas. The largest is the Nairobi National Park, located in the Southern side of the city. Other recreational areas and protected forests include [[Uhuru Park]], Central Park, John Michuki Park, [[Nairobi Arboretum]], City Park, [[Uhuru Gardens]], [[Jeevanjee Gardens]], [[Karura Forest]], [[Ngong forest]], and Ololua forest.

== Culture ==
Nairobi is a diverse melting pot of African cultures. As a cosmopolitan African city, it hosts all the diverse tribes that make up Kenya, and hosts a large immigrant population from other African countries. <ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-06-04 |title=Kenya Among Countries with largest number of African immigrants - Kenyan Wall Street |url=https://kenyanwallstreet.com/kenya-among-countries-with-largest-number-of-african-immigrants/ |access-date=2024-03-27 |language=en-US |archive-date=27 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240327074432/https://kenyanwallstreet.com/kenya-among-countries-with-largest-number-of-african-immigrants/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nielect.com/county_moreinfo.php?cid=46|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002062623/http://www.nielect.com/county_moreinfo.php?cid=46|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-10-02|title=NiElect::Be a Peace Ambassador|date=2013-10-02|access-date=2019-09-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Desgroppes|first1=Amélie|last2=Taupin|first2=Sophie|date=2011-09-01|title=Kibera: The Biggest Slum in Africa?|url=http://journals.openedition.org/eastafrica/521|journal=Les Cahiers d'Afrique de l'Est / The East African Review|language=en|issue=44|pages=23–33|doi=10.4000/eastafrica.521|s2cid=16003013|issn=2071-7245|doi-access=free|access-date=6 September 2019|archive-date=6 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906161345/https://journals.openedition.org/eastafrica/521|url-status=live}}</ref>

Nairobi has two informal nicknames.

===Literature and film===
[[File:Nairobi Cinema.jpg|thumb|left|Nairobi Cinema]]

''[[Kwani?]]'' is Kenya's first literary journal and was established by writers living in Nairobi. Nairobi's publishing houses have also produced the works of some of Kenya's authors, including [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]] and [[Meja Mwangi]] who were part of post-colonial writing.

Many film makers also practice their craft out of Nairobi. Film-making is still young in the country, but people like producer Njeri Karago and director Judy Kibinge are paving the way for others.

Perhaps the most famous book and film set in Nairobi is ''[[Out of Africa]]''. The book was written by [[Karen Blixen]], whose pseudonym was Isak Dinesen, and it is her account of living in [[Kenya]]. Karen Blixen lived in the Nairobi area from 1917 to 1931. The neighbourhood in which she lived, [[Karen, Kenya|Karen]], is named after her.

In 1985, ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' was made into a film, directed by [[Sydney Pollack]]. The film won 28 awards, including seven [[Academy Awards]]. The popularity of the film prompted the opening of Nairobi's [[Karen Blixen Museum, Kenya|Karen Blixen Museum]].

Nairobi is also the setting of many of the novels of [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]], Kenya's foremost writer.

Nairobi has been the set of several other [[Cinema of the United States|American]] and [[British Film Industry|British]] films. The most recent of these was ''[[The Constant Gardener (film)|The Constant Gardener]]'' (2005), a large part of which was filmed in the city. The story revolves around a British diplomat in Nairobi whose wife is murdered in northern Kenya. Much of the filming was in the [[Kibera]] slum.

Among the latest Kenyan actors in Hollywood who identify with Nairobi is [[Lupita Nyong'o]]. Lupita received an Oscar award for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|best supporting actress]] in her role as Patsy in the film ''[[12 Years a Slave]]'' during the ''[[86th Academy Awards]]'' at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles. Lupita is the daughter of Kenyan politician Peter Anyang' Nyong'o.

Most new Hollywood films are nowadays screened at Nairobi's cinemas. Up until the early 1990s, there were only a few film theatres and the repertoire was limited. There are also two [[Drive-in theater|drive-in cinemas]] in Nairobi.

In 2015 and 2016, Nairobi was the focus point for the American television series ''[[Sense8]]'' which shot its first and second seasons partly in the city. The TV series has high reviews in [[The Internet Movie Database]] (IMDB).

In 2015 Nairobi was also featured in the British thriller film ''[[Eye in the Sky (2015 film)|Eye in the Sky]]'', which is a story about a lieutenant general and a colonel who faced political opposition after ordering a drone missile strike to take out a group of suicide bombers in Nairobi.

In 2017, the name "Nairobi" was taken as a code-name by a female main character in the famous Spanish TV series ''[[Money Heist]]''.

===Food===
In Nairobi, there are a range of restaurants. Besides being home to ''[[nyama choma]]'' which is a local term used to refer to roasted meat, there are American fast food restaurants such as [[KFC]], [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], [[Domino's|Domino's Pizza]], [[Pizza Hut]], [[Hardee's]] and [[Burger King]], and the longer established South African chains, [[Galito's]], [[Steers (restaurant)|Steers]], PizzaMojo, and [[Spur Steak Ranches]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/10/13223149-fast-food-finds-fans-in-sub-sahara-africa-where-obesity-problem-is-growing?lite |title=Fast food finds fans in sub-Sahara Africa, where obesity problem is growing – World News |publisher=Worldnews.nbcnews.com |access-date=12 December 2013 |archive-date=16 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116210535/http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/10/13223149-fast-food-finds-fans-in-sub-sahara-africa-where-obesity-problem-is-growing?lite |url-status=live }}</ref> Coffee houses, doubling up as restaurants and mostly frequented by the upper middle classes, such as Artcaffe [[Java House|Nairobi Java House]] and Dormans, have become increasingly popular in recent days. Traditional food joints such as the popular K'osewe's in the city centre and Amaica, which specialize in African delicacies, are also widespread. The Kenchic franchise which specialized in old-school chicken and chips meals was also popular, particularly among the lower classes and students, with restaurants all over the city and its suburbs. However, as of February 2016, Kenchic stopped operating its eatery business. Upscale restaurants often specialize in specific cuisines such as Italian, Lebanese, Ethiopian, and French, but are more likely to be found in five star hotels and the wealthier suburbs in the West and South of the city.

Nairobi has an annual restaurant week (NRW) at the beginning of the year, January–February. Nairobi's restaurants offer dining packages at reduced prices.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://eatout.co.ke/nairobi-restaurant-week |title=Nairobi Restaurant Week 2016 |last=Kenya |first=EatOut |website=eatout.co.ke |access-date=10 April 2016 |archive-date=7 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407004913/http://eatout.co.ke/nairobi-restaurant-week |url-status=dead }}</ref> NRW is managed by Eatout Kenya which is an online platform that lists and reviews restaurants in Nairobi, and provides a platform for Kenyan foodies to congregate and share.

===Music===

Nairobi is the centre of Kenya's music scene. [[Benga music|Benga]] is a Kenyan genre which was developed in Nairobi. The style is a fusion of [[jazz]] and [[Luo (Kenya and Tanzania)|Luo]] music forms. Mugithi is another popular genre in Kenya, with its origins in the central parts of the country. A majority of music videos of leading local musicians are also filmed in the city.

In the 1970s, Nairobi became the prominent centre for music in the [[African Great Lakes]]. During this period, Nairobi was established as a hub of [[soukous]] music. This genre was originally developed in [[Kinshasa]] and [[Brazzaville]]. After the political climate in the region [[Congo Crisis|deteriorated]], many Congolese artists relocated to Nairobi. Artists such as [[Super Mazembe|Orchestra Super Mazembe]] moved from [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] to Nairobi and found great success.<ref>{{cite web|title=Orchestra Super Mazembe |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |url=http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/worldmusic/view/page.basic/artist/content.artist/orchestra_super_mazembe_28113 |access-date=4 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231064112/http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/worldmusic/view/page.basic/artist/content.artist/orchestra_super_mazembe_28113 |archive-date=31 December 2007}}</ref> [[Virgin records]] became aware of the popularity of the genre and signed recording contracts with several [[soukous]] artists.

More recently, Nairobi has become the centre of the [[Kenyan hip hop]] scene, with Kalamashaka, Gidi Gidi Majimaji being the pioneers of urban music in Kenya. The genre has become very popular amongst local youth, and domestic musicians have become some of the most popular in the region.<ref>{{cite web|title=Revealed: The real origin of Kenyan hip hop|url=https://www.sde.co.ke/article/2000189439/revealed-the-real-origin-of-kenyan-hip-hop|last=Nyanga|first=Caroline|website=Standard Digital News|access-date=2020-05-11|archive-date=23 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200623023917/https://www.sde.co.ke/article/2000189439/revealed-the-real-origin-of-kenyan-hip-hop|url-status=dead}}</ref> Successful artists based in Nairobi include [[Jua Cali]], [[Nonini]], [[Camp Mulla]], [[Juliani]], [[Eric Wainaina (musician)|Eric Wainaina]], Suzanna Owinyo and [[David Mathenge|Nameless]]. Popular record labels include [[Ogopa DJs]], Grand Pa Records, Main Switch, Red Black and Green Republik, [[Calif Records]] and Bornblack Music Group.

Many foreign musicians who tour Africa perform in Nairobi. [[Bob Marley]]'s first-ever visit to Africa started in Nairobi. Acts that have performed in Nairobi include Lost Boyz, [[Wyclef Jean]], [[Shaggy (artist)|Shaggy]], [[Akon]], Eve, T.O.K, [[Sean Paul]], [[Wayne Wonder]], [[Alaine]], Konshens, [[Ja Rule]], and [[Morgan Heritage]], and Cabo Snoop. Other international musicians who have performed in Nairobi include the rocking show by Don Carlos, Demarco, Busy Signal, Mr. Vegas and the Elephant man crew.

Nairobi, including the coastal towns of Mombasa and Diani, have recently become the centre of [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] in Kenya, producing DJs as well as producers like Jack Rooster, Euggy, [[DJ Fita]], Noise on Demand, DJ Vidza, DJ Coco EM.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Prominent international composers and DJs have also toured in Nairobi, including [[Diplo]], [[Major Lazer]], [[Kyau & Albert]], Solarity, [[Ronski Speed]], and [[Boom Jinx]].

Many nightclubs in and around the city have witnessed a growth in the population that exclusively listen to Electronic Dance Music, especially amongst the younger generations.{{POV statement|date=December 2012}} These youth also support many local EDM producers and DJs, such as Jahawi, Mikhail Kuzi, Barney Barrow, Jack Rooster, HennessyLive, Trancephilic5<ref>Topdeejays, [https://web.archive.org/web/20141019152855/https://topdeejays.com/trance/kenya/ "Top deejays in database Kenya"], "topdeejays.com",</ref> As well as up and comers such as L.A Dave, Eric K, Raj El Rey, Tom Parker and more.{{Dubious|date=December 2012}}

Gospel music is also popular in Nairobi just as in the rest of Kenya, with gospel artists having a great impact in the mostly Christian city.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Artists such as Esther Wahome, Eunice Njeri, Daddy Owen, Emmy Kosgei and the late Angela Chibalonza, among others, are popular among the general population while others like MOG, Juliani, Ecko dyda, DK Kwenye Beat are more popular among the younger generation.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Theor most popular concerts are Groove tours, TSO (Totally Sold Out) new year concerts.

Musical group [[Sauti Sol]] performed for U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] when he was in the city for the 2015 [[Global Entrepreneurship Summit]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ges2015.org/|title=GES 2015 IS COMING|website=GES 2015 – Global Entrepreneurship Summit|access-date=6 May 2017|archive-date=26 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726033400/http://www.ges2015.org/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Sport==
[[File:Nyayo_stadium_from_above.jpg|thumb|[[Nyayo National Stadium]]]]
Nairobi is the African Great Lakes region's sporting centre. The premier sports facility in Nairobi and generally in Kenya is the [[Moi International Sports Centre]] in the suburb of Kasarani. The complex was completed in 1987, and was used to host the 1987 [[All Africa Games]]. The complex comprises a 60,000 seater stadium, the second largest in the African Great Lakes (after Tanzania's new national stadium), a 5,000 seater gymnasium, and a 2,000 seater aquatics centre.<ref>{{cite web|title=Moi International Sports Centre |publisher=Stadia |url=http://www.stadiumskenya.co.ke/default2.asp?active_page_id=835 |access-date=4 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614004430/http://www.stadiumskenya.co.ke/default2.asp?active_page_id=835 |archive-date=14 June 2008 }}</ref>

===Higher education===
[[File:Universityofnairobi2.jpg|thumb|right|[[University of Nairobi]]]]
Nairobi is home to several Universities and Colleges.
* The [[University of Nairobi]] is the largest and oldest university in Kenya. It was established in 1956, as part of the [[University of East Africa]], but became an independent university in 1970. The university has approximately 84,000 students.<ref name="uonbi.ac.ke">{{cite web|url=http://uonbi.ac.ke/node/4315|title=University of Nairobi Factfile – UNIVERSITY OF NAIROBI|access-date=18 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201035948/http://uonbi.ac.ke/node/4315|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>
* [[Kenyatta University]] is situated {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Nairobi on the Nairobi road Thika dual carriageway on {{convert|1100|acre|ha|order=flip}} of land. The university was chartered in 1985, offering mainly education-related courses, but has since diversified, offering medicine, environmental studies, engineering, law, business, statistics, agriculture, and economics. It has a student body of about 32,000, the bulk of whom (17,000) are in the main campus. It is one of the fastest-growing public universities.
* [[Strathmore University]] started in 1961 as an [[Advanced Level (UK)]] Sixth Form College offering Science and Arts subjects. The college started to admit accountancy students in March 1966, and thus became a university. In January 1993, Strathmore College merged with Kianda College and moved to Ole Sangale Road, Madaraka Estate, Nairobi.
* [[United States International University|United States International University – Nairobi]] was originally a branch of the [[United States International University]], but became a fully autonomous university in 2005. It was first established in 1969. The university has accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, in the US, and the Government of Kenya. It is located in a quiet west side location of Roysambu area north-central Nairobi opposite the Safari Park Hotel.
* In 2005, The [[Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi|Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi]] was upgraded to a health sciences teaching hospital, providing post graduate education in medicine and surgery including nursing education, henceforth renamed the Aga Khan University Hospital.
* The [[Catholic University of Eastern Africa]] located in Lang'ata suburb, obtained its "Letter of Interim Authority" in 1989. Following negotiations between the Authority of the Graduate School of Theology and the Commission for Higher Education (CHIEA), the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences was established three years later, culminating in the granting of the Civil Charter to CHIEA on 3 November 1992.
* [[Technical University of Kenya|The Technical University of Kenya]] (formerly Kenya Polytechnic) is the only [[Institute of technology|Technical University]] in the country. Established in 1961 as the Kenya Technical Institute, the university was chartered by [[Mwai Kibaki]] in 2013 to become an independent institution of higher learning (It was previously a constituent college of the University of Nairobi). It offers highly technical degree courses in three faculties: Engineering and Built Environment, Applied Sciences and Technologies, and Social Sciences and Technologies.

==Infrastructure==
===Transport===
[[File:Syokimau Railway Station.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Syokimau Railway Station]]
Major plans are being implemented in the need to decongest the city's traffic and the completion of [[Thika Road]] has given the city a much needed face-lift attributed to road's enhancement of global standards. Several projects have been completed (Syokimau Rail Station, the Eastern and Northern Bypasses) while numerous other projects are still underway.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-11-27 |title=How to get to Syokimau Railway Station in Embakasi by Bus? |url=https://moovitapp.com/index/en/public_transit-Syokimau_Railway_Station-Nairobi-site_34921496-3540 |access-date=2023-12-11 |website=moovitapp.com |language=en-KE |archive-date=11 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231211180228/https://moovitapp.com/index/en/public_transit-Syokimau_Railway_Station-Nairobi-site_34921496-3540 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The development of these critical transport facilities will, besides reducing transport costs due to faster movement of goods and people within the region, also increase trade, improve the socio-economic welfare of Northern Kenya and boost the country's potential in attracting investments from all over the world.

====Airports====
[[File:Nairobi Arrivals Terminal.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]]]]
[[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]] is the largest airport in Kenya. Domestic travelers made up 40% of overall passengers in 2016. An increase of 32% in 5 yrs since 2012. JKIA had more than 7 million passengers going through it in 2016. In February 2017, JKIA received a Category One Status from the [[FAA]] boosting the airport's status as a Regional Aviation hub.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2001232614/aviation-sector-in-new-high-as-passenger-numbers-hit-record-10-million|title=Aviation sector in new high as passenger numbers hit record 10 million|first=Frankline|last=Sunday|access-date=4 May 2017|archive-date=14 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314073709/https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2001232614/aviation-sector-in-new-high-as-passenger-numbers-hit-record-10-million|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Wilson Airport]] is a general-aviation airport handling smaller aircraft, mostly propeller-driven. In July 2016, construction of a new air traffic control Tower commenced at a cost of KES 163 million (approximately US$1.63 million).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2000210004/wilson-airport-builds-sh163m-tower-amidst-land-grabbing-claims|title=Wilson Airport builds Sh163m tower amidst land grabbing claims|first=Peter|last=Muiruri|access-date=4 May 2017|archive-date=5 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905174300/https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2000210004/wilson-airport-builds-sh163m-tower-amidst-land-grabbing-claims|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Moi Air Base]] is a military airport. In its earlier years, it was utilised as a landing strip in the pre-[[jet aircraft|jet]] airline era. It was mostly used as a British passenger and mail route from [[Southampton]] to [[Cape Town]] in the 1930s & 1940s. This route was served by [[flying boat]]s between Britain and [[Kisumu]] and then by land-based aircraft on the routes to the south.

====Matatu====
[[File:A matatu.jpg|thumb|left|A matatu]]
{{main|Matatu}}
Matatus are the most common form of public transport in Nairobi. [[Matatu]], which literally translates to "three cents for a ride" (nowadays much more) are privately owned minibuses, and the most popular form of local transport.<ref>{{cite web |last=United Nations Offices Nairobi Interns |title=How to get around Nairobi |publisher=interns.unon.org |url=http://interns.unon.org/index%206.1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203075002/http://interns.unon.org/index%206.1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 February 2007 |access-date=5 July 2007 }}</ref> They generally seat fourteen to thirty three. Matatus operate within Nairobi, its environs and suburbs and from Nairobi to other towns around the country.<ref name="uonbi.ac.ke"/> The matatu's route is imprinted along a yellow stripe on the side of the bus, and matatus plying specific routes have specific route numbers.However, in 2004, a [[Seat belt legislation|law was passed requiring all matatus to include seat belts]] and [[speed governor]]s and to be painted with a yellow stripe.<ref>{{cite news|title=Crackdown hits Kenyan commuters|publisher=BBC|date=2 February 2004|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3450777.stm|access-date=3 July 2006|archive-date=2 April 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040402081250/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3450777.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> At first, this caused a furore amongst Matatu operators, but they were pressured by government and the public to make the changes. Matatus are now limited to {{convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.

However, in November 2014 President Uhuru Kenyatta lifted the ban on the yellow stripe and allowed matatus to maintain the colourful graphics in an effort to support the youth in creating employment. Matatus in Nairobi were easily distinguishable by their extravagant paint schemes, as owners would paint their matatu with various colourful decorations, such as their favourite [[association football|football]] team or [[hip hop music|hip hop]] artist. They are notorious for their poor safety records, which are a result of overcrowding and reckless driving. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Due to the intense competition between matatus, many are equipped with powerful sound systems and television screens to attract more customers.

====Buses====
[[File:Nairobi Public Transport.jpg|thumb|Public transport in Nairobi]]
Buses are increasingly becoming common in the city with some even going to the extents of installing complimentary WiFi systems in partnership with the leading mobile service provider. There are four major bus companies operating the city routes and are the traditional Kenya Bus Service (KBS), and newer private operators Citi Hoppa, Compliant MOA and Double M. The Citi Hoppa buses are distinguishable by their green livery, the Double M buses are painted purple, Compliant MOA by their distinctively screaming names and mix of white, blue colours while the KBS buses are painted blue.

Companies such as Easy Coach, Crown Bus, Coast Bus, Modern Coast, Eldoret Express, Chania, the Guardian Angel, Spanish and Mash Poa run scheduled buses and luxury coaches to other cities and towns.

A [[Bus rapid transit]] will commence operating with 100 high capacity buses along [[Thika Road]] in July 2022 between [[Kasarani]] and the [[Kenyatta National Hospital]]. After the pilot, Nairobi Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (Namata) will implement another 300 buses as the first phase that will expand the [[Bus rapid transit|BRT]] line to run from [[Ruiru]] to [[Kenyatta National Hospital]]. A second phase will later extend the line to run between Kenol in [[Murang'a County]] to [[Ongata Rongai]] in [[Kajiado County]].

====Trains====
[[File:Nairobi Terminus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nairobi Terminus]]]]
Nairobi was founded as a [[railway town]], and the main headquarters of [[Kenya Railways|Kenya Railways (KR)]] is still situated at [[Nairobi railway station]], which is located near the city centre. The line runs through Nairobi, from [[Mombasa]] to [[Kampala]]. Its main use is freight traffic connecting Nairobi to Mombasa and [[Kisumu]]. A number of morning and evening commuter [[Nairobi rail service|trains]] connect the centre with the suburbs, but the city has no proper light rail, tramway, or rapid transit lines. A proposal has been passed for the construction of a commuter rail line. The country's third president since independence, President [[Mwai Kibaki]] on Tuesday, 13 November 2012 launched the Syokimau Rail Service marking a major milestone in the history of railway development in the country. The opening of the station marked another milestone in efforts to realise various projects envisaged under the Vision 2030 Economic Blueprint. The new station has a train that ferries passengers from [[Syokimau]] to the city centre cutting travel time by half. Opening of the station marks the completion of the first phase of the Sh24b Nairobi Commuter Rail Network that is geared at easing traffic congestion in Nairobi, blamed for huge economic losses. Other modern stations include Imara Daima Railway Station and Makadara Railway Station.

The new [[Mombasa–Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway]] connects the port city of Mombasa and Nairobi. The new railway line has virtually replaced the old metre-gauge railway. The [[Nairobi Terminus]] is located at [[Syokimau]], some 20 km from the city centre. Passengers travelling from Mombasa are transferred the short distance into the CBD with the metre-gauge trains.

====Roads====
[[File:The A104 heading to Nairobi CBD.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|The A104 heading to Nairobi CBD]]

Two trans-African automobile routes pass through Nairobi: the [[Cairo-Cape Town Highway]] and the [[Lagos-Mombasa Highway]]. Nairobi is served by highways that link Mombasa to Kampala in Uganda and Arusha in Tanzania. These are earmarked to ease the daily motor traffic within and surrounding the metro area. However, driving in Nairobi is chaotic. Most of the roads are tarmacked and there are signs showing directions to certain neighbourhoods. The city is connected to the [[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]] by the Mombasa Highway, which passes through Industrial Area, South B, South C and Embakasi. [[Ongata Rongai]], Langata and Karen are connected to the city centre by Langata Road, which runs to the south. Lavington, Riverside, and Westlands are connected by Waiyaki Way. Kasarani, Eastlands, and Embakasi are connected by [[Thika Road]], Jogoo Road, and Outer Ring Road.

Highways connect the city with other major towns such as Mombasa, Machakos, Voi, (A109), [[Eldoret]], [[Kisumu]], [[Nakuru]], [[Naivasha]], and Namanga Border Tanzania (A104).

Nairobi is undergoing major road constructions to update its infrastructure network. The new system of roads, flyovers, and bridges are intended to better cope with high traffic levels. It is also a major component of Kenya's Vision 2030 and Nairobi Metropolis plans. Most roads now are well lit and surfaced with adequate signage.

In 2020, the construction of The [[Nairobi Expressway]] began. The Nairobi expressway is a 27 km toll road connecting the Eastern Nairobi neighbourhood of Mulolongo to the uptown neighbourhood of Westlands at James Gichuru junction through Nairobi CBD. The road is directly to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport enabling travellers to access the airport faster avoiding the heavy traffic on Mombasa Road and Waiyaki Way. The road has an 11.025 km elevated section between Airtel Center and Westlands.
[[File:The Nairobi Expressway in Chiromo.jpg|thumb]]
This road, is intended to ease traffic from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport that accesses Nairobi city center. Also traffic from Central Nairobi is expected to be facilitated, to reduce the number of departing passengers who miss their fights, while stuck in road traffic jams on the city streets.[5] The work involves expansion of the existing road to four-lanes one-way, (8 lanes total), with foot paths, drainage channels, overpass bridges and street lighting. It was opened to the public in May 2022.

===Water supply and sanitation===
{{Further|Water supply and sanitation in Nairobi}}
94% of the piped water supply for Nairobi comes from rivers and reservoirs in the [[Aberdare Range]] north of the city, of which the reservoir of the [[Thika Dam]] is the most important one. Water distribution losses – technically called [[non-revenue water]] – are 40%, and only 40% of those with house connections receive water continuously. Slum residents receive water through [[water kiosk]]s and end up paying much higher water prices than those fortunate enough to have access to piped water at their residence.

There is a wide variety of housing options in Nairobi. The options range from privately owned housing units/apartments, rented units, leased spaces and even houses on mortgage. Most wealthy Kenyans live in Nairobi, but the majority of Nairobians are of average and low income. Half of the population has been estimated to live in [[Slum|slums]] which cover just 5% of the city area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalurban.org/Issue1PIMag05/Sheehan%20article.htm |title=Where the Sidewalks End |publisher=Globalurban.org |date=11 September 2001 |access-date=18 October 2010}}</ref> The growth of these slums is a result of urbanisation, poor town planning, lack of good governance and proper leadership in these settlements and lack of empowerment and social capital among other factors.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Mutisya |first1=Emmanuel |last2=Yarime |first2=Masaru |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1363074369 |title=Understanding the Grassroots Dynamics of Slums in Nairobi: The Dilemma of Kibera Informal Settlements |date=2011 |oclc=1363074369}}</ref>

[[Kibera]] has been the setting for several films, the most recent being ''[[The Constant Gardener (film)|The Constant Gardener]]''.

Other notable slums include [[Mathare]] and [[Korogocho]]. Altogether, 66 areas are counted as slums within Nairobi.<ref>{{cite web |title=The slums of Nairobi: explaining urban misery |publisher=encyclopedia.com |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-150852093.html |access-date=2 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323110512/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-150852093.html |archive-date=23 March 2008 }}</ref>

Many Nairobi non-slum-dwellers live in relatively good housing conditions. Large houses can be found in many of the upmarket neighbourhoods, especially to the west of Nairobi. Middle and high income estates include [[Gigiri]], [[Muthaiga]], [[Langata]] and [[Karen, Kenya|Karen]]. Other middle and high income estates include [[Parklands, Nairobi|Parklands]], [[Westlands, Nairobi|Westlands]], Hurlingham, Kilimani, Milimani, Spring Valley, Lavington, Rosslyn, Kitisuru, and Nairobi Hill.

To accommodate the growing middle class, many new apartments and housing developments are being built in and around the city. The most notable development is ''Greenpark'', at [[Athi River (town)|Athi River]], [[Machakos County]] {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Nairobi's Central Business District. Over 5,000 houses, villas and apartments are being constructed at this development, including leisure, retail and commercial facilities.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kenya Engineer |title=Housing estate being developed at Stoney Athi |publisher=kenyaengineer.com |url=http://www.kenyaengineer.com/newsdetails.php?NewsID=314&AuthorID=45&CountryID=7&NewsTypeID=16&IssueID=36 |access-date=2 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014062115/http://www.kenyaengineer.com/newsdetails.php?NewsID=314&AuthorID=45&CountryID=7&NewsTypeID=16&IssueID=36 |archive-date=14 October 2007 }}</ref> The development is being marketed to families, as are most others within the city. Eastlands also houses most of the city's middle class and includes [[South C]], [[South B]], [[Embakasi]], [[Buru Buru]], Komarock, Donholm, Umoja, and various others.

==Crime and law enforcement==
Crime levels and safety have very much improved in Nairobi over recent years. Violent crime is rare but petty crime can still be an issue. In general, petty crime in Nairobi mostly involves pickpocketing and theft, and on rare occasions can be confrontational. Although there have been a handful of isolated attacks in Kenya by Al Shaabab from neighbouring Somalia, these incidences are rare.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nomads |first=World |date=2016-11-04 |title=Is Kenya Safe for Travelers? 10 Things I Wish I Knew |url=https://www.worldnomads.com/travel-safety/africa/kenya/the-realities-of-kenya-crime |access-date=2024-03-07 |website=www.worldnomads.com |language=en |archive-date=11 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240211142740/https://www.worldnomads.com/travel-safety/africa/kenya/the-realities-of-kenya-crime |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Media==
[[File:Nation Center.jpg|thumb|Nation Centre, headquarters of the [[Nation Media Group]]]]

Nairobi is home to most of Kenya's news and media organisations. The city is also home to the region's largest newspapers: the ''[[Daily Nation]]'' and ''[[The Standard (Kenya)|The Standard]]''. These are circulated within Kenya and cover a range of domestic and regional issues. Both newspapers are published in English. People Daily is also the leading free newspaper distributed on the streets of Nairobi. It is published by Mediamax Limited.

[[Kenya Broadcasting Corporation]], a state-run television and radio station, is headquartered in the city. [[Kenya Television Network]] is part of the Standard Group and was Kenya's first privately-owned TV station. The Nation Media Group runs NTV which is based in Nairobi, The Royal Media Services (RMS). There are also a number of prominent radio stations located in Kenya's capital including Citizen radio, Inooro fm, KISS 100, Capital FM, East FM, Kameme FM, Metro FM, and Family FM, among others.

Several multinational media organisations have their regional headquarters in Nairobi.
