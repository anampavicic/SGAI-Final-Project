The '''Sunshine Coast''' is a [[peri-urbanisation|peri-urban]] region in [[South East Queensland]], Australia. In 1967, it was defined as "the area contained in the [former] Shires of [[Shire of Landsborough|Landsborough]], [[Shire of Maroochy|Maroochy]] and [[Shire of Noosa|Noosa]], but excluding [[Bribie Island]]".<ref>{{Cite QPN|32861|Sunshine Coast|district |access-date=26 November 2017}}</ref> Located {{cvt|100|km|mi}} north of the centre of [[Brisbane]] in [[South East Queensland]], on the [[Coral Sea]] coastline, its urban area spans approximately {{cvt|60|km|mi}} of coastline and [[hinterland]] from [[Pelican Waters, Queensland|Pelican Waters]] to [[Tewantin]].

The area has several coastal hubs at [[Caloundra]], [[Kawana Waters, Queensland|Kawana Waters]], [[Maroochydore]] and [[Noosa Heads, Queensland|Noosa Heads]]. [[Nambour]] and [[Maleny, Queensland|Maleny]] have developed as primary commercial centres for the hinterland.

Since 2014, the Sunshine Coast district has been split into two [[Local government areas of Queensland|local government areas]], the [[Sunshine Coast Region]] and the [[Shire of Noosa]], which administer the southern and northern parts of the Sunshine Coast respectively.

As of June 2021, with an estimated urban population of 398,840,<ref name="ABSSUA">{{cite web |date=26 July 2022 |title=Regional population |url=https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/regional-population/latest-release |access-date=3 October 2022 |publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] |archive-date=30 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210330092152/https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/regional-population/latest-release |url-status=live}}</ref> the Sunshine Coast is the fifth most populated area in [[Queensland]] and the 9th most populous in the country.<ref name="ABSSUA" /> The population of the area has grown steadily at an average annual rate of 2.4% year-on-year over the five years to 2018.<ref name="ABSSUA" />

==History==
[[File:Aerial vista of Sunshine Coast University and its surrounds. 2023.jpg|thumb|Aerial vista of the University of the Sunshine Coast and its surrounds in 2023.]]
The earliest residents of the Sunshine Coast were the indigenous [[Gubbi Gubbi]] and [[Wakka Wakka]] people.<ref name=Mathew1910>[[John Mathew|Mathew, John]] (1910). [https://archive.org/details/tworepresentativ00math ''Two Representative Tribes of Queensland'']. London: T.

[[Gubbi Gubbi language|Gubbi Gubbi]] (Kabi Kabi, Cabbee, Carbi, Gabi Gabi) is an [[Australian Aboriginal language]] spoken on Gubbi Gubbi country. The Gubbi Gubbi language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the [[Sunshine Coast Region]] and [[Gympie Region]], particularly the towns of [[Caloundra]], [[Noosa Heads, Queensland|Noosa Heads]], [[Gympie]] and extending north towards [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]] and south to [[Caboolture, Queensland|Caboolture]]''.''<ref>{{Cite SLQ-CC-BY|url=https://maps.slq.qld.gov.au/iyil/view/13|title=Gubbi Gubbi|author=|date=|website=Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages map|access-date=23 January 2020}}</ref>

In 1770, [[James Cook]] on the deck of [[HM Bark Endeavour|HM Bark ''Endeavour'']] became the first known [[History of Australia (1788â€“1850)|European]] to sight the [[Glass House Mountains]], located south-west of Caloundra.<ref>{{cite web |title=Glass House Mountains National Park |url=http://www.derm.qld.gov.au/parks/glass-house-mountains/culture.html |publisher=[[Queensland Government]] |access-date=12 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405002842/http://www.derm.qld.gov.au/parks/glass-house-mountains/culture.html |archive-date=5 April 2011}}</ref>

In the 1820s, former convicts [[John Finnegan (explorer)|John Finnegan]], [[Thomas Pamphlett]] and [[Richard Parsons (convict)|Richard Parsons]] landed on [[Moreton Island]] after becoming hopelessly lost fetching cedar. They lived with the Kabi Kabi for eight months.

Thereafter, during the 1830s to 1840s, the district became home to numerous runaway convicts from the [[Moreton Bay]] (Brisbane) penal colony slightly to the south.<ref>{{cite web |title=Department of Natural Resources and Mines and Maroochy Shire Council |url=http://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/addfiles/documents/projects/msfs_cultural_heritage.pdf |page=17 |author=GHD |date=March 2005 |access-date=12 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725074334/http://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/addfiles/documents/projects/msfs_cultural_heritage.pdf |archive-date=25 July 2011}}</ref>

In 1842, Governor [[George Gipps]] had the entire Sunshine Coast and hinterland from Mt Beerwah north to roughly Eumundi declared a "Bunya Bunya Reserve" for the protection of the [[Araucaria bidwillii|bunya tree]] after [[Andrew Petrie]] advised him of the importance of bunya groves in Aboriginal culture.<ref>{{cite web |last=Henley |first=John R. |title=The first settlers of the Nambour area |url=http://www.starfieldobservatory.com/MapletonTramway/2FirstSettlers.htm |access-date=29 October 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108030026/http://www.starfieldobservatory.com/MapletonTramway/2FirstSettlers.htm |archive-date=8 November 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, during the 1840s and 1850s, the Bunya Bunya Reserve and its vicinity became the scene of some of the most bitter skirmishes of Australia's "[[Black War]]". The [[Blackall Range]], on account of the tri-annual Bunya Festival, served as both a hideout and rallying point for attacks against white settlements. By the 1850s timber cutters and cattlemen had started exploiting the area; in 1860 the Bunya Bunya Reserve was scrapped.

Many of the Sunshine Coast's towns began as simple ports or jetties for the timber industry during the 1860s and 1870s, as the area once had magnificent stands of forest. Likewise, the region's roads often began as snigging tracks for hauling timber. Timber getters used the region's creeks, rivers and lakes as seaways to float out their logs of cedar â€“ the resultant wood being shipped as far afield as Europe.

During the Gympie Gold Rush (1867), prospectors scaled the Sunshine Coast mountains to develop easier roadways to and from the gold fields of Gympie. After the construction of the [[North Coast railway line, Queensland|railway line to Gympie]], the coastal and river towns, being mostly ports for the early river trade, were bypassed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nambour â€“ Sunshine Coast Regional Council |url=http://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/library/sitePage.cfm?code=nambour |access-date=12 June 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725074238/http://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/library/sitePage.cfm?code=nambour |archive-date=25 July 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

By the 1890s, diverse small farming (fruit and dairy) had replaced the cattle-and-timber economy of earlier decades. [[Sugar cane]] and [[pineapple]]s proved especially important to produce for the district. Many small hamlets and towns now emerged. Produce was initially taken by horse to Landsborough, then to Eudlo in 1891.<ref>{{cite web |title=Buderim â€“ Sunshine Coast Regional Council |url=http://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/library/sitePage.cfm?code=buderim |access-date=12 June 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725074317/http://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/library/sitePage.cfm?code=buderim |archive-date=25 July 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The post-World War I era saw the rise of the "seaside shack". The seaside shack provided the opportunity for the coastal "getaway" with modest investment. From 1914 to 1946, they popped up all along the North Coast (because it was north of Brisbane). Seaside shacks were exceedingly cheap and were an early use of the concept of recycling. Many were built of disused or second grade timber, all kinds of materials were used for the holiday seaside shack, including [[fibro cement]], metal containers, and left-over farm sheds; even disused trams were sold off as seaside shacks.<ref>{{SLQ-CC-BY|url=https://www.slq.qld.gov.au/blog/shacks-sheds-and-cottages-queensland-weekenders-early-20th-century|title=Shacks, sheds and cottages: Queensland 'Weekenders' in the early 20th century|date=7 October 2022|authors=Christina Ealing-Godbold|access-date=24 January 2023}}</ref>

Especially after World War II, the Sunshine Coast grew into a holiday and surfing destination. This tendency was further expanded in the development boom of the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>{{cite QHR|30454|Cotton Tree Caravan Park|602707 |access-date=12 August 2015}}</ref>

Around the same time, various tourist attractions and theme parks were created, such as the [[Big Pineapple]] in [[Woombye, Queensland|Woombye]].<ref name="qhr">{{cite QHR|30333|The Big Pineapple (former Sunshine Plantation)|602694 |access-date=1 August 2014}}</ref>

After the 1980s, the Sunshine Coast experienced rapid population growth. {{As of|2016}} it had become one of the fastest-growing regions in Australia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/3218.0Main%20Features302016 |title=3218.0 â€“ Regional Population Growth, Australia, 2016: Queensland |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |access-date=1 June 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815075953/http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/3218.0Main%20Features302016 |archive-date=15 August 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> As the region becomes increasingly residential, most of the district's distinctive small farms â€“ especially tropical-fruit and sugar-cane farms have disappeared, as have most of its theme parks.

In 2008, The [[Shire of Noosa]], [[Shire of Maroochy]] and [[City of Caloundra]] merged to form the [[Sunshine Coast Region]]. The 2007 [[referendum]] conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission and leading to the merger remained controversial in Noosa Shire, where 95% of voters had rejected amalgamation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Australian Electoral Commission 2007 Results of plebiscites on council amalgamations |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/referendums/Advisory_Referendums/qld_council_2007/results.htm |access-date=25 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610162226/http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/referendums/Advisory_Referendums/qld_council_2007/results.htm |archive-date=10 June 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In March 2013, a second referendum resulted in 81% of residents voted to leave the amalgamated Sunshine Coast Region. On 9 November 2013 an election resulted in Noel Playford being elected to take office as mayor on 1 January 2014 with the new council.<ref name="2013 Election">[http://www.ecq.qld.gov.au/elections/local/LG2013/NoosaShireCouncil/results/mayoral/district1.html ecq.qld.gov.au] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110024044/http://www.ecq.qld.gov.au/elections/local/LG2013/NoosaShireCouncil/results/mayoral/district1.html |date=10 November 2013 }} â€“ 013 Noosa Shire Council â€“ Mayoral Election â€“ 10 November 2013</ref>

The Shire of Noosa was re-established on 1 January 2014. This resulted in two geopolitical areas occupying the area generally recognised as 'The Sunshine Coast'. The Sunshine Coast Region, governed by the Sunshine Coast Council and the Shire of Noosa, governed by Noosa Shire Council.

===Climate===
Sunshine Coast has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[KÃ¶ppen climate classification|Cfa]]) typical of South Queensland.
