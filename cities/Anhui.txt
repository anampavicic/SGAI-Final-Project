Its provincial capital and largest city is [[Hefei]]. The province is located across the basins of the [[Yangtze]] and [[Huai river]]s, bordering [[Jiangsu]] and [[Zhejiang]] to the east, [[Jiangxi]] to the south, [[Hubei]] and [[Henan]] to the west, and [[Shandong]] to the north. With a population of 61 million, Anhui is the 9th most populous province in China. It is the 22nd largest Chinese province based on area, and the 12th most densely-populated region of all 34 Chinese provincial regions. Anhui's population is mostly composed of [[Han Chinese]]. Languages spoken within the province include [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin]], [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Huizhou Chinese|Hui]], [[Gan Chinese|Gan]] and small portion of [[Central Plains Mandarin]].

The name "Anhui" derives from the names of two cities: [[Anqing]] and [[Huizhou, Anhui|Huizhou]] (now [[Huangshan City]]).<ref>

The provincial government of Anhui includes a Governor, Provincial Congress, the People's Political Consultative Conference, and the Provincial Higher People's Court. Aside from managing local government departments, the Anhui provincial government manages 16 cities, 62 counties, 43 county-level districts and 1,522 townships. Anhui's total GDP ranked 14th among China's 31 province-level regions {{as of|2022||lc=on}}.

==History==
[[File:三河古镇朝阳楼 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The old town of [[Sanhe, Feixi County]]]]
Anhui was established 1667, during the reign of the [[Qing dynasty]]'s [[Kangxi Emperor]]. The province's nickname, "Wan", is taken from the name of a small state that existed in the region during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (722–481&nbsp;BC). The name "Wan" also corresponds to the province's [[Mount Tianzhu]] and {{ill|state of Wan|zh|皖國|dl=Wan state}}. Evidence of human beings inhabiting what is now Anhui 20,000 years before present has been attested by archaeological findings in [[Fanchang County]], related to he cultural domains of [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] and [[Longshan culture|Longshan]], dated to the [[Neolithic]] period (8000–2000&nbsp;BC). In relation to these cultures, archeologists have discovered through excavation a 4500-year-old city called the Nanchengzi Ruins in [[Guzhen County]], after they discovered a Neolithic city wall and a moat that was part of a much larger and integrated city in the region during their 2013 disinterment.<ref>{{Cite web |title=4,500-year-old city discovered in China |url=https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/4-500-year-old-city-discovered-in-china-543398 |access-date=2022-10-14 |website=NDTV.com}}</ref>
[[File:亚新地学社1936年《袖珍中华全图》--08安徽省.jpg|thumb|Anhui in 1936]]
There are many historical sites located in the province dating to the pre-imperial period. The culture of northern Anhui was associated with that of the [[North China Plain]], together with what is now Henan, northern Jiangsu, and southern Shandong. Central Anhui was densely populated, and consisted of the fertile [[Huai River]] watershed. Contrastingly, southern Anhui was closer to [[Jiangxi]] and southern [[Jiangsu]]; the hills in the southeastern part of the province formed a unique cultural sphere. After the [[Qin dynasty]] unified China in 221&nbsp;BC, the territory of modern Anhui belonged to different prefectures, including Jiujiang, Zhang, Tang, and Sishui. The lands became part of the [[Yang prefecture|Yang]], [[Yù Prefecture|Yu]], and Xu prefectures during the [[Han dynasty]] (202&nbsp;BC{{snd}}220&nbsp;AD). During the [[Three Kingdoms]] era (222–280), Anhui was dominated at various times by [[Eastern Wu]] and [[Cao Wei]]. By the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), the economy and culture of area was flourishing. Anhui became part of the province of [[Henan]] during the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368); during the [[Ming dynasty]] the area was directly administrated by the imperial capital in [[Nanjing]].

Anhui and [[Jiangsu]] were merged into one province under the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912) until 1666, during the reign of the [[Kangxi Emperor]]. It played an important role in the [[Self-Strengthening Movement]] led by Li Hongzhang during the later Qing; at this time,  western weapons, factories and administrative theories were being introduced into China. Over the next 50 years, Anhui became one of the country's most radically liberal areas, with important 20th-century figures moving to the province, like the poet and diplomat [[Hu Shih]], and [[Chen Duxiu]], the founder of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP).

In 1938, large areas in north and central Anhui were severely damaged by the decision of President [[Chiang Kai-shek]] to demolish a critical dam on the [[Yellow River]], hoping that would physically impede the ongoing invasion by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and prevent them from capturing [[Zhengzhou]]. Within only ten days of the dam breaking, the water and sands drowned all of north and middle area of this province, resulting in the deaths of between 500,000 and 900,000 Chinese people, as well as an unknown number of Japanese soldiers. Following the end of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1945, the capital city of Anhui moved to [[Hefei]], then a small town. The provincial government made significant investments for its development. After 1949, the government launched projects to repair the damages suffered during World War II. The province underwent significant development via the [[Third Front (China)|Third Front]] campaign to build basic and national defense industries in protected locations, in case of invasion by the Soviet Union or United States. The centerpiece of the Shanghai Small Third Front was the "rear base" in Anhui which served as "a multi-function manufacturing base for anti-aircraft and anti-tank weaponry".<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last1=Xu |first1=Youwei |title=Everyday Lives in China's Cold War Military Industrial Complex: Voices from the Shanghai Small Third Front, 1964-1988 |last2=Wang |first2=Y. Yvon |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |year=2022 |isbn=978-3-030-99687-1|pages=xiii-xvi}}</ref> During the late 1990s Anhui became one of China's fastest-growing provinces. The province forms part of the China Yangtze River Delta Economic Area, which is the most developed area of China.

==Geography==
[[File:Anhui Fuyang Yingquan White House.jpeg|thumb|250x250px|Government building in Fuyang City]]
Anhui is topographically diverse. The north is part of the [[North China Plain]] while the north-central areas are part of the [[Huai River]] watershed. Both regions are flat, and densely populated. The land becomes more uneven further south, with the [[Dabie Mountains]] occupying much of southwestern Anhui and a series of hills and ranges cutting through southeastern Anhui, between which is the [[Yangtze River]]. The highest peak in Anhui is Lotus Peak, part of [[Huangshan]] in southeastern Anhui. It has an altitude of 1873&nbsp;m (6,145&nbsp;ft).

Major rivers include the [[Huai River]] in the north and the Yangtze in the south. The largest lake is [[Lake Chaohu]] situated in the center of the province, with an area of about {{convert|800|km2|abbr=on}}. The southeastern part of the province near the Yangtze River has many lakes as well.

As with topography, the province differs in climate from north to south. The north is more temperate with more distinct seasons. January temperatures average at around −1 to 2&nbsp;°C north of the Huai River, and 0 to 3&nbsp;°C south of the Huai River; in July temperatures average 27&nbsp;°C or above. [[East Asian rainy season|Plum rains]] occur in June and July and may cause flooding.

Anhui has 16 cities. Economically, top 3 cities are, [[Hefei]], [[Wuhu]] and [[Anqing]].

==Government==
{{Main|Politics of Anhui|List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China}}
The Politics of Anhui Province is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.

The Governor of Anhui ({{lang|zh-hans|安徽省省长}}) is the highest-ranking official in the Anhui Provincial People's Government. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Anhui [[Chinese Communist Party]] Provincial Committee Secretary ({{lang|zh-hans|安徽省委书记}}), colloquially termed the "Anhui Party Chief".

Most provincial government departments and the Governor office are located at No.1 Zhongshan Road, moved from old downtown of Hefei since 2016. Provincial government is responsible to manage 16 prefecture-level cities, 105 counties, 1845 townships and different departments in Anhui. The Anhui Provincial People's Congress is just located near provincial government. The Provincial [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] (CPPCC) is located at No.317, Suzhou Road. The Provincial Higher People's Court is located at no. 472 Changjiang Rd.

Typically, annual provincial congress meeting is held in the first quarter of each year shortly before national congress meeting and the annual meeting of CPPCC is held in the first quarter or the fourth quarter of each year.

==Economy==
Agriculture in Anhui varies according to the climate zones. To the north of the [[Huai River]], [[wheat]] and [[sweet potato]]es are grown, while to the south it is [[rice]] and wheat instead. {{As of|2022}}, Anhui's [[Gross domestic product|nominal GDP]] was [[United States dollar|US$]]670 billion ([[Renminbi|CN¥]] 4.51 trilion), about 3.72% of the country's GDP and ranked [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP|10th]] among [[Administrative divisions of China|province-level administrative units]]; the province's primary, secondary and tertiary industries were worth CN¥351.37 billion (US$52.24 billion), CN¥1.8588 trillion (US$276.36 billion) and CN¥2.29433 trillion (US$341.1 billion) respectively. Its nominal GDP per capita was US$10,943 (CN¥73,603) and ranked the [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita|14th]] in the country.<ref name="GDPdata" />

Natural resources of Anhui include [[iron]] in [[Ma'anshan]], [[coal]] in [[Huainan]], and [[copper]] in [[Tongling]]. There are industries related to these natural resources (e.g. [[steel industry]] at Ma'anshan). One of the famous Anhui-based corporations is the automobile company [[Chery]], which is based in [[Wuhu City|Wuhu]].
[[File:Chuzhao Dingyuan Lianpuxiang - Nongke Hanlin Zhu IMG 9222.jpg|thumb|Farmlands of Anhui]]
Compared to its more prosperous neighbours to the east, [[Zhejiang]] and [[Jiangsu]], Anhui has lagged markedly behind in economic development, with a [[gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita around half of those two provinces in 2017 rapidly improved from 1/3 of those two provinces in 2010. However, the provincial GDP per capita is based on the population registered in the province (that is, with local [[Hukou]]), but not necessarily residing there. There is significant regional disparity, where much of the wealth is concentrated in industrial regions close to the [[Yangtze River]], such as [[Hefei]], Wuhu, and Ma'anshan. The province is home to a large cluster of white goods manufacture such as Haier, Hisense, Whirlpool, Gree, Royalstar, and Meling.

===Major economic and technological development zones===
====Hefei Economic and Technological Development Zone====
Hefei Economic and Technological Development Zone is located in the southwest of Hefei and was established in 1993. It is located close to Hefei Luogang International Airport.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/hefei-economic-technological-development-zone/ |title=Hefei Economic and Technological Development Zone |publisher=RightSite.asia |access-date=2013-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723233421/http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/hefei-economic-technological-development-zone |archive-date=2012-07-23 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Hefei Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone====
Hefei Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone was founded in October 1990 and approved by the State Council as a state-level Development Zone in March 1991. In 1997, the Development Zone was ratified as an APEC Science and Technology Industrial Park, with special open policies to APEC and EU members. Hefei High Tech Park was also approved as a National High Tech Export Base in 2000 and obtained the award of an Advanced High Tech Zone under the Torch Program in 2003. So far, more than 100 hi-tech enterprises have entered the zone. Industries encouraged in the zone include chemical production and processing, electronics assembly & manufacturing, instruments & industrial equipment, medical Equipment and telecommunications.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/hefei-hi-tech-industrial-development-zone/ |title=Hefei Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone |publisher=RightSite.asia |access-date=2013-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723233432/http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/hefei-hi-tech-industrial-development-zone |archive-date=2012-07-23 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Wuhu Economic and Technological Development Zone====
Established in 1993, Wuhu Economic and Technological Development Zone was the first state-level development zone approved by central government in Anhui, utilising the transportation advantage of the Yangtse Delta at [[Wuhu]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/wuhu-economic-technological-development-zone/ |title=RightSite.asia {{!}} Wuhu Economic & Technological Development Zone |access-date=2010-04-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418215909/http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/wuhu-economic-technological-development-zone |archive-date=2010-04-18 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Wuhu Export Processing Zone====
Wuhu Export Processing Zone was approved to be a national level export processing zone, with a total planned area of {{convert|2.95|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/wuhu-export-processing-zone/ |title=Wuhu Export Processing Zone |publisher=RightSite.asia |access-date=2013-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723233459/http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/wuhu-export-processing-zone |archive-date=2012-07-23 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Transportation==
[[File:201705 CRH380B-3606 at Hefei Station.jpg|thumb|A high-speed train in Hefei railway station]]
[[File:Hefei South Railway Station.jpg|thumb|Hefei South Railway Station]]
[[File:201705 Exit A of Hefei Railway Station Metro.jpg|thumb|a metro entrance in Hefei]]
Historically, Anhui's transport network was hampered by the lack of bridges across the [[Yangtze River]], which divides the province into northern and southern regions.  The first bridge across the Yangtze in Anhui, the [[Tongling Yangtze River Bridge]], was completed in 1995.  As of October 2014, Anhui had [[Yangtze River bridges and tunnels|four bridges]] across the Yangtze, at [[Ma'anshan Yangtze River Bridge|Ma'anshan]], [[Wuhu Yangtze River Bridge|Wuhu]], Tongling, and [[Anqing Yangtze River Bridge|Anqing]].

===Rail===
Anhui lacked a developed railway network until this century: most cities are now connected by a high-speed train system. [[Hefei South railway station]] is the high-speed train hub.

===Highway system===
The province set an ambitious plan from 2015 to 2025 for highways including:

[[G3 Beijing-Taipei Expressway]]

[[G40 Shanghai-Xi'an Expressway]]

[[G42 Shanghai-Chengdu Expressway]]

S24 Changshu-Hefei Expressway

===Subway===
Hefei and Wuhu have subway systems. The [[Hefei Metro]] has 2 completed lines, 3 lines under construction and another 10 lines planned. The [[Wuhu Metro]] has 2 subway lines under construction and another 3 lines planned.

===Aviation===
The province has 5 major commercial airports and another 4 are under construction. Hefei Xinqiao International Airport and Huangshan International Airport are the 2 international airports. The 5 airports in operation are:

*[[Hefei Xinqiao International Airport]] {{airport codes|HFE|ZSOF}}
*[[Huangshan Tunxi International Airport]] {{airport codes|TXN|ZSTX}}
*[[Fuyang Xiguan Airport]] {{airport codes|FUG|ZSFY}}

==Culture==
Anhui spans many geographical and cultural regions. The northern, flatter parts of the province, along the [[Huai River]] and further north, are most akin to neighboring provinces like [[Henan]], [[Shandong]] and northern [[Jiangsu]]. In contrast, the southern, hilly parts of the province are more similar in culture and dialect to other southern, hilly provinces, like [[Zhejiang]] and [[Jiangxi]].

[[Mandarin dialects]] are spoken over the northern and central parts of the province, north of the Yangtze river. Dialects to the north (e.g. [[Bengbu dialect]]) are classified as [[Zhongyuan Mandarin]], together with dialects in provinces such as Henan and Shandong; dialects in the central parts (e.g. [[Hefei dialect]]) are classified as [[Jianghuai Mandarin]], together with dialects in the central parts of neighboring [[Jiangsu]] province. Non-Mandarin dialects are spoken to the south of the Yangzi: dialects of [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] are spoken in [[Xuancheng]] [[prefecture-level city]], though these are rapidly being replaced by Jianghuai Mandarin; dialects of [[Gan Chinese|Gan]] are spoken in a few counties in the southwest bordering Jiangxi province;<ref>{{cite book

[[Huangmeixi]], which originated in the environs of [[Anqing]] in southwestern Anhui, is a form of traditional [[Chinese opera]] popular across China. [[Huiju]], a form of traditional opera originating in the [[Huizhou Chinese|Huizhou]]-speaking areas of southern Anhui, is one of the major precursors of [[Beijing Opera]]; in the 1950s, Huiju (which had disappeared) was revived. [[Lu opera|Luju]] is a type of traditional opera found across central Anhui, from east to west.

[[Anhui cuisine]] is one of the eight great traditions of [[Chinese cuisine]]. Combining elements of cooking from northern Anhui, south-central Anhui, and the Huizhou-speaking areas of southern Anhui, Anhui cuisine is known for its use of wild game and herbs, both land and sea, and comparatively simple methods of preparation.

Anhui has a high concentration of traditional products related to calligraphy: Xuanzhou (today [[Xuancheng]]) and Huizhou (today [[Huangshan City]]) are revered for producing [[Xuan Paper]] and [[Hui Ink]], respectively, which are traditionally considered the best types of paper and ink for [[Calligraphy|Chinese calligraphy]]. [[She County, Anhui|She County]] is famous for the [[She Inkstone]], one of the most preferred types of [[inkstone]]s (a required tool in traditional calligraphy). {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}
