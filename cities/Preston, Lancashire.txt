The south bank of the Ribble is part of the Preston urban area, although it forms the [[South Ribble]] borough that is administratively separate.

Preston and its surrounding area have provided evidence of ancient [[Roman Britain|Roman]] activity, largely in the form of a [[Roman road]] that led to a camp at [[Walton-le-Dale]]. The [[Angles (tribe)|Angles]] established Preston; its name is derived from the [[Old English]] meaning "priest's settlement" and in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' is recorded as "Prestune". In the [[Middle Ages]], Preston was a parish and township in the hundred of [[Amounderness]] and was granted a Guild Merchant charter in 1179, giving it the status of a [[market town]]. Textiles have been produced since the mid-13th century when locally produced wool was woven in people's houses. [[Flemish people|Flemish]] weavers who settled in the area in the 14th century helped develop the industry. In the early-18th century, [[Edmund Calamy (historian)|Edmund Calamy]] described Preston as "a pretty town with an abundance of gentry in it, commonly called Proud Preston".<ref>{{Cite journal

 }}</ref> Sir [[Richard Arkwright]], inventor of the [[spinning frame]], was born in the town. The most rapid period of growth and development coincided with the industrialisation and expansion of [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|textile manufacturing]]. Preston was a [[boomtown]] of the [[Industrial Revolution]], becoming a densely populated engineering centre, with large industrial plants. The town's textile sector fell into terminal decline from the mid-20th century and Preston has subsequently faced similar challenges to other [[Post-industrial society|post-industrial]] [[Northern England|northern]] towns, including deindustrialisation, economic deprivation and housing issues.

Preston is the seat of [[Lancashire County Council]], houses the main campus of the [[University of Central Lancashire]] (UCLan) and is home to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], a founder member of [[the Football League]] and the first [[List of English football champions|English football champions]] in [[1888–89 Preston North End F.C. season|1889]]. In that season, the team also won the league and cup [[Double (association football)|double]] and went unbeaten in the league. It took 115 years until another team went a full season unbeaten. After winning another league title the year afterwards, the team has not won a championship since and their latest major trophy was the [[1938 FA Cup Final|1938 FA Cup]]. 

The demonym for residents of the city is "Prestonian".<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Prestonian|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Prestonian|journal=The Free Dictionary|access-date=29 December 2016|archive-date=9 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109144844/https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Prestonian|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.preston.gov.uk/thecouncil/news-room/the-prestonian/|title=The Prestonian {{!}} Preston City Council|last=m.moville|website=Preston.gov.uk|access-date=29 December 2016|archive-date=30 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230090949/http://www.preston.gov.uk/thecouncil/news-room/the-prestonian/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Lancashire}}

===Early development===
During the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period, Roman roads passed close to what is now the centre of Preston. For example, the road from [[Luguvalium]] to [[Mamucium]] (now Carlisle to Manchester) crossed the [[River Ribble]] at [[Walton-le-Dale]], {{convert|3/4|mi|km|0}} southeast of the centre of Preston, and a Roman camp or station may also have been here.<ref>[[William Dobson (antiquary)|William Dobson]], ''Rambles by the Ribble'', Volume 3, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=qu4-AAAAYAAJ&pg=RA2-PA78 Ch. 8, Walton-le-Dale] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200107000423/https://books.google.com/books?id=qu4-AAAAYAAJ&pg=RA2-PA78 |date=7 January 2020 }}", Publisher: W. and J. Dobson, 1864</ref><ref>Charles Hardwick, "On the Roman Remains Recently Discovered at Walton-le-Dale, Near Preston", in ''Transactions'', Volumes 7–8, Historic Society of Lancashire and Published 1855, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MAUNAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA127 pp. 127] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191231021254/https://books.google.com/books?id=MAUNAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA127 |date=31 December 2019 }}</ref> At Withy Trees, {{convert|1+1/2|mi|km|0}} north of Preston, the road crossed another Roman road from [[Bremetennacum]] (the Roman fort at [[Ribchester]]) to the coast.<ref>Hodge, 1997. pp. 3–5.</ref>

An explanation of the origin of the name is that the Priest's Town refers to a priory set up by St Wilfrid near the Ribble's lowest ford. This idea is supported by the similarity of the [[Lamb of God|Paschal lamb]] on Preston's crest with that on St Wilfrid's.<ref>Walsh and Butler, 1992.</ref>

When first mentioned in the 1086 [[Domesday Book]], Preston was already the most important town in [[Amounderness]] (the area of Central Lancashire between the rivers [[River Ribble|Ribble]] and [[River Cocker, Lancashire|Cocker]], including [[The Fylde]] and the [[Forest of Bowland]]). When assessed for tax purposes in 1218 – 19 it was the wealthiest town in the whole county.<ref>Hodge, 1997. pp. 6–10.</ref>

===Guild Merchant===
[[File:Guild emblem.jpg|thumb|2012 Preston Guild roadside emblem]]
The right to hold a ''Guild Merchant'' was conferred by [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] upon the [[burgess (title)|burgesses]] of Preston in a charter of 1179; the associated Preston Guild is a civic celebration held every 20 years, the last being in 2012. It is the only guild still celebrated in the UK.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.visitpreston.com/visitor-information/about-preston/preston-guild|title=Preston Guild|publisher=Visit Preston |access-date=29 February 2024}}</ref>

Before 1328, celebrations were held at irregular intervals, but at the guild of that year it was decreed that subsequent guilds should be held every 20 years. After this, there were breaks in the pattern for various reasons, but an unbroken series were held from 1542 to 1922. A full 400-year sequence was frustrated by the cancellation of the 1942 guild due to [[World War II]], but the cycle resumed in 1952. The expression '(Once) every Preston Guild', meaning 'very infrequently', has passed into fairly common use, especially in Lancashire.

Guild week is always started by the opening of the Guild Court, which since the 16th century has traditionally been on the first Monday after the feast of the [[Beheading of John the Baptist]] celebrated on 29 August. As well as concerts and other exhibitions, the main events are a series of processions through the city. Numerous street parties are held in the locality.

In 1952 the emphasis was on the bright new world emerging after the war. The major event, held in the city's [[Avenham Park]], had every school participating, and hundreds of children, from toddlers to teenagers, demonstrated different aspects of physical education in the natural amphitheatre of the park.

The 2012 guild formally opened on 2 September with a mayoral proclamation and the return of "friendship scrolls" that had travelled the world.<ref>[http://www.itv.com/news/granada/2012-09-01/preston-guild-friendship-scrolls-return/  Preston Guild – Friendship scrolls return] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109144844/https://www.itv.com/news/granada/2012-09-01/preston-guild-friendship-scrolls-return |date=9 January 2021 }} Retrieved 3 September 2012.</ref> Highlights in the programme for the 2012 celebration included two concerts in Avenham Park – one by [[Human League]] and another, a "Proms In The Park", featuring [[José Carreras]], [[Katherine Jenkins]] and the [[Manchester Camerata]].

===Pre-industrial Preston===
[[File:Plaque in Preston Lancashire commemorating Rev Joseph (Daddy) Dunn and first gas-lit building.jpg|thumb|Plaque in Fox Street commemorating the work of [[Joseph Dunn (revolutionary)|Reverend Joseph Dunn]] in bringing [[gas lighting]] to the town]]

In the mid-12th century, Preston was in the hundred of [[Amounderness]], in the deanery of Amounderness and the archdeaconry of [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]]. The name "Amounderness" is more ancient than the name of any other "Wapentake" or hundred in the County of Lancashire, and the fort at Tulketh, strengthened by [[William the Conqueror]], shows that the strategic importance of the area was appreciated even then.<ref>{{cite web |author=John Moss, for Papillon (Manchester UK) Limited |url=http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/lancashire1.html |title=The County of Lancashire, England, UK |publisher=Manchester2002-uk.com |access-date=17 July 2010 |archive-date=26 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326000753/http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/lancashire1.html |url-status=usurped }}</ref>

The location of the city, almost exactly midway between [[Glasgow]] and London, led to many confrontations with [[Scotland]]. Preston was burned by the Scots during [[The Great Raid of 1322]] but two years later had quickly recovered. Decisive battles were also fought here, most notably during the [[English Civil War]] at the [[Battle of Preston (1648)]], and then the first [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] rebellion, whose invasion of England was brought to a conclusion by the defeat of the pro-Catholic and pro-monarchial Jacobite army at the [[Battle of Preston (1715)]]. [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]] alludes to this latter defeat in her poetical illustration, ''Preston'', to an engraving of a painting by [[Thomas Allom]], in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book 1834.<ref>{{cite book|last =Landon|first=Letitia Elizabeth|title=Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1834|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=19BbAAAAQAAJ&pg=GBS.PT70|section=poetical illustration|year=1833|publisher=Fisher, Son & Co.}}{{cite book|last =Landon|first=Letitia Elizabeth|title=Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1834|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=19BbAAAAQAAJ&pg=GBS.PT73|section=picture|year=1833|publisher=Fisher, Son & Co.}}</ref>

In the last great Jacobite Rising, on 27 November 1745 the Jacobite Prince of Wales and Regent, [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]] passed through Preston with his Highland Army on the way south through Chorley and Manchester to Derby intending to take London and the Crown. Preston was the first of quite a few places in England where the Prince was cheered as he rode by and where he was joined by some English volunteers for his Army. One Jacobite eyewitness noted that from Preston onwards, "at every town we were received with ringing of bells, and at night we have bonfires, and illuminations".<ref>SP 36/75, fol.84, fols.177a, 179, Alexander Blair to Mrs Blair, 5 December.1745.</ref> Another Jacobite eyewitness noted in a private letter from Preston on 27 November 1745: "People here are beginning to join [us] very fast; we have got about sixty recruits today".<ref>SP 36/75, fol.87, – to Lady Gask, 27 November.1745.</ref> From 10 to 12 December the Prince gave his retreating Army a rest in Preston on their long, last and fatal retreat from Derby through Lancaster and Carlisle to their dreadful day of destiny the following 16 April on [[Battle of Culloden|Culloden Moor]] near [[Inverness]].<ref>Fitzroy Maclean, 'Bonnie Prince Charlie' 1988</ref>

===Industrial revolution===
The 19th century saw a transformation in Preston from a small market town to a much larger industrial one, as the innovations of the latter half of the previous century such as [[Richard Arkwright]]'s [[water frame]] (invented in Preston) brought cotton mills to many northern English towns. With industrialisation came examples of both oppression and enlightenment.

The town's forward-looking spirit is typified by it being the first English town outside London to be lit by gas. The Preston Gas Company was established in 1815 by, amongst others, a Catholic priest: Rev. Joseph "Daddy" Dunn of the [[Society of Jesus]]. The [[Preston and Wigan Railway]] arrived in 1838, shortly afterwards renamed the [[North Union Railway]]. The [[Sheffield]] firm of [[Thos. W. Ward]] Ltd opened a [[ship breaking]] yard at [[Preston Dock]] in 1894.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ribblesteam.wordpress.com/2013/10/13/preston-dock-shipbreakers/ |title=Preston Dock – Shipbreakers |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=12 October 2013 |website=ribblesteam.wordpress.com |publisher=The Ribble Pilot |access-date=16 November 2017 |archive-date=9 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109144835/https://ribblesteam.wordpress.com/2013/10/13/preston-dock-shipbreakers/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The more oppressive side of industrialisation was seen during the [[Preston Strike of 1842]] on Saturday 13 August 1842, when a group of cotton workers demonstrated against the poor conditions in the town's mills. The [[Riot Act]] was read and armed troops corralled the demonstrators in front of the [[Corn Exchange, Preston|Corn Exchange]] on Lune Street. Shots were fired and four of the demonstrators were killed. A commemorative sculpture now stands on the spot (although the soldiers and demonstrators represented are facing the wrong way). In the 1850s, [[Karl Marx]] visited Preston and later described the town as "the next [[St Petersburg]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1854/08/01a.htm|title=Karl Marx in the New York Daily Tribune 1854|date=1 August 1854|access-date=20 September 2006|archive-date=9 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109144910/https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1854/08/01a.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Charles Dickens]] visited Preston in January 1854 during [[Preston strike of 1853–4|a strike by cotton workers]] that had by that stage lasted for 23 weeks. It is believed that the town of "Coketown" in the novel ''[[Hard Times (novel)|Hard Times]]'' was inspired by this visit to Preston. In 1858, the [[Preston Power Loom Weavers' Association]] was founded, and by 1920 it had more than 13,000 members in the town.<ref name="marsh">{{cite book|last1=Marsh|first1=Arthur|last2=Ryan|first2=Victoria|last3=Smethurst|first3=John B.|title=Historical Directory of Trade Unions|volume=4|date=1994|publisher=Ashgate|location=Farnham|isbn=9780859679008|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historicaldirect0004mars/page/113 113–115]|url=https://archive.org/details/historicaldirect0004mars/page/113}}</ref>

The Preston Temperance Society, led by [[Joseph Livesey]] pioneered the [[Teetotalism|Temperance Movement]] in the 19th century. Indeed, the term [[teetotalism]] is believed to have been coined at one of its meetings. The website of the [[University of Central Lancashire]] library has a great deal of information on Joseph Livesey and the Temperance Movement in Preston.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uclan.ac.uk/library/usersupport/lrs/collections/livesey/index.htm|title=The Livesey Collection|access-date=20 September 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060911182933/http://www.uclan.ac.uk/library/usersupport/lrs/collections/livesey/index.htm |archive-date = 11 September 2006}}</ref>

Preston was one of only a few industrial towns in Lancashire to have a functioning corporation (local council) in 1835 (its charter dating to 1685), and was reformed as a [[municipal borough]] by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]. It became the [[County Borough of Preston]] under the [[Local Government Act 1888]]. In 1974, county boroughs were abolished, and it became part of the larger part of the new non-metropolitan district, the [[Borough of Preston]], which also included [[Fulwood Urban District]] and much of [[Preston Rural District]].

===Preston since the early 20th century===
[[File:Preston Town Hall, from the Guild Hall balcony - geograph.org.uk - 161713.jpg|thumb|[[Preston Town Hall]], completed in 1934]]
By 1901, nearly 120,000 people were living in Preston, now a booming industrial town.

New industries arrived in Preston during the interwar years which helped ease the pain felt through the sharp decline of the cotton industry. Electrical goods manufacturing and engineering arrived in the town, and the building sector enjoyed a boom with nearly 3,000 [[Council housing|council houses]] being built between 1920 and 1939. Some 1,500 houses were built for private sale.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Despite its heavy industry, Preston endured only a handful of [[Luftwaffe]] air raids in World War II and there were no fatalities in the town, although an air crash in the [[Freckleton]] district claimed the lives of 61 people in 1944.

For some 20 years after 1948, Preston became home to a significant number of Asian and [[Caribbean]] [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] immigrants, who mostly worked in the manufacturing industry. However, an economic decline hit the town once again in the 1970s, capped by the closure of the [[Courtaulds]] factory in 1979 (nearly 3,000 job losses) and the decline of the [[Preston Dock|docks]] on the [[River Ribble]], which finally closed in 1981. Mass unemployment was firmly back in Preston by the early 1980s, although it was now very much a national crisis due to the [[Early 1980s recession#United Kingdom|recession of that time]].

The rehousing of families from town centre slums to new council houses continued after World War II, though it slowed down to a virtual standstill after 1975.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} The face of the town centre began to change in the 1960s, with old developments being bulldozed and replaced by modern developments such as the [[St George's Shopping Centre (Preston)|St George's Shopping Centre]], which opened in 1966, and the [[Fishergate Shopping Centre]] which was built nearly 20 years later. The remains of the Victorian town hall, designed by [[George Gilbert Scott]] and mostly destroyed by fire in 1947, were replaced by an office block (Crystal House) in 1962, and a modern-architecture [[Preston Guild Hall|Guild Hall]] opened in 1972, to replace the Public Hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madeinpreston.co.uk/General/musicinpreston.html|title=Music in Preston|work=Made in Preston|access-date=22 August 2020|archive-date=9 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109144835/http://www.madeinpreston.co.uk/General/musicinpreston.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The town was by-passed by [[Preston By-pass|Britain's very first motorway]], built and operated by engineer James Drake, which was opened by [[Harold Macmillan]] in December 1958. Within a decade, this formed part of the [[M6 motorway|M6]] – giving Preston a direct motorway link with [[Manchester]] and [[Birmingham]]. The late 1960s saw the completion of Ringway, a [[Bypass (road)|bypass]] around the town centre, as well as a [[Preston bus station|new bus station]].<ref>Lambert, Tim, [http://www.localhistories.org/preston.html A Brief history of Preston, Lancashire] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109144835/http://www.localhistories.org/preston.html |date=9 January 2021 }}</ref>

==Governance==
{{further|City of Preston, Lancashire}}
The unparished urban settlement of Preston is represented by 19 of the 22 council wards within [[Preston City Council]] which is based at [[Preston Town Hall]] on Lancaster Road. From the 2024 General Election, Preston is divided between two Westminster constituencies, namely [[Preston (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston]] and [[Ribble Valley (UK Parliament constituency)|Ribble Valley]]. The [[County Hall, Preston|County Hall]] is located on Fishergate and is the main office for [[Lancashire County Council]].<ref>"Opening of the new Town-Hall at Preston". ''The Times''. 15 September 1882.</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Map of Preston.png|thumb|300px|Regions of Preston]]
{{Further|List of places in Preston}}

The [[River Ribble]] provides a southern border for the city. The [[Forest of Bowland]] forms a backdrop to Preston to the northeast while [[the Fylde]] lies to the west. At {{Coord|53|45|N|2|42|W}}, Preston is approximately {{convert|27|mi}} north west of [[Manchester]], {{convert|26|mi}} north east of [[Liverpool]], and {{convert|15|mi}} east of the coastal town [[Blackpool]].

The current borders came into effect on 1 April 1974, when the [[Local Government Act 1972]] merged the existing [[County Borough of Preston]] with [[Fulwood Urban District]] as an unparished area within the [[Borough of Preston]]. Preston was designated as part of the [[Central Lancashire]] new town in 1970.

The climate of Preston is of a temperate maritime type, with a narrow range of temperatures, similar to the rest of the British Isles. Being relatively close to the Irish sea, this is more pronounced than areas to the south and east of Preston. The official Met Office weather station is located at Moor Park, less than {{convert|1|mi}} north of the city centre, and surrounded by built-up areas, suggesting a degree of urban warming is likely, particularly during clear and calm nights.

One of the proposed derivations of the city's name coming from 'Priests' town'. The lamb on the city shield is a biblical image of Jesus Christ, and the same image that represented 7th-century bishop [[St Wilfrid]], the city's patron saint who is historically linked to the city's establishment. The "PP" on the city shield stands for "Princeps Pacis" (Prince of Peace), another title for Christ invoking Him as protector of the city, though it is also often taken to stand for the city's nickname "Proud Preston". In fact, there were originally three letters "P" on the [[coat of arms]], with one being lost over time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.preston.gov.uk/thecouncil/the-mayor/civic-regalia |title=Civic regalia, insignia and Mayoral chains |publisher=Preston City Council |access-date=28 April 2012 |archive-date=14 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114154421/http://www.preston.gov.uk/thecouncil/the-mayor/civic-regalia/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Economy==
Preston has seen many changes over the course of its history in regards to its local economy, shifting from a market town to the textile industry and more recently to tertiary education and research.

The city was home to [[Alstom]] Transport's main UK spare parts distribution centre (formerly [[GEC Traction|GEC Traction Ltd]]) until it transferred operations to [[Widnes]] in July 2018.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-41753242| publisher=BBC News| title=Rail firm Alstom to close historic Preston site after 120 years| date=25 October 2017| access-date=10 February 2020| archive-date=9 January 2021| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109144958/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lancashire-41753242| url-status=live}}</ref> [[Matalan]] Retail Ltd was also founded in Preston under the name Matalan Cash and Carry. Although the head office of Matalan moved to [[Skelmersdale]] in 1998, the city still has the tax office for the company (located in [[Winckley Square]]).

Goss Graphic Systems Limited, a global supplier of [[printing press]]es based in the United States, formerly employed more than 1,000 people in Preston, but in 2007 the company moved manufacturing to the United States, China and Japan and now has around 160 employees in the city.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lep.co.uk/news/Goss-in-talks-to-axe.5109639.jp | title=Goss in talks to axe 60 more staff | first=David | last=Coates | work=[[Lancashire Evening Post]] | publisher=[[Johnston Press]] | date=25 March 2009 | access-date=5 April 2009 | archive-date=27 March 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327205905/http://www.lep.co.uk/news/Goss-in-talks-to-axe.5109639.jp | url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Retail===
[[File:Fishergate, weekday afternoon - geograph.org.uk - 1710853.jpg|thumb|Fishergate, Preston's main shopping district]]

Retail is also a major contributor to Preston's economy. The city's main high streets are Fishergate and Friargate which offer shops, bars and restaurants with many more tucked away down the side streets. Two major shopping centres are located along the high streets:
*[[Fishergate Shopping Centre]] – which had a [[Debenhams]] department store (closed May 2021)
*[[St George's Shopping Centre (Preston)|St George's Shopping Centre]] (formerly ''The Mall Preston'') – a popular centrally located shopping mall dating from the 1960s.

Preston is also home to the historic [[Covered Market, Preston|Covered Market and Fishmarket]]. In 2016 these sites were redeveloped, and the old covered market now contains the new Market Hall and the Outdoor and Secondhand Markets, and the old fish market now contains the Box Market, a unique shopping space consisting of upgraded shipping containers. Market vendors sell fresh and local quality meat, fish, fruit, vegetables, and dairy products, other hot and cold food to eat in or take away, as well as brewed ales and artisan coffee. The markets are open Monday–Saturday, and on Tuesdays a [[car boot sale]] operates from the Outdoor Market.<ref name=PrestonMarkets>{{cite web| url=https://www.prestonmarkets.co.uk/| publisher=Preston Markets| title=Preston Markets| access-date=10 February 2020| archive-date=9 January 2021| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109145000/https://www.visitpreston.com/visit/shopping/preston-markets/| url-status=live}}</ref>

Also in the city centre is the [[Miller Arcade]], a specialist shopping centre in a listed building (which formerly included [[public baths]]), is situated off Fishergate near the [[Harris Museum]].

===Education and research===
The [[University of Central Lancashire]] ("UCLan ") has become a major employer and source of economic growth not just for Preston in recent years, but for Lancashire as a whole, providing direct and indirect benefits to the local economy through employment, housing and retail.

The Regeneris Report commissioned by the [[Lancashire County Council]] in 2013/14 found that UCLan:
* contributed over £200m to the North West economy
* was one of the largest employers in Preston and supported an estimated 4,300 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) jobs in the North West through its core economic footprint and through the expenditure of students
* with 36,160 students was the largest university in Lancashire and the third-largest in the North West, with the 9th largest undergraduate population of all UK universities
* graduates add on average £24m to the North West economy per annum through increased skills and productivity<ref name=UCLanRegeneris>{{cite web| url=https://www.uclan.ac.uk/news/report_highlights_uclans_importance_to_regional_economy.php| publisher=University of Central Lancashire| title=Report Highlight's UCLan'S Importance To Regional Economy| access-date=10 February 2020| archive-date=9 January 2021| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109144957/https://www.uclan.ac.uk/news| url-status=live}}</ref>

In terms of direct economic benefits, in 2013/14 UCLan:
* directly employed 3,290 staff 
* spent £15 million on suppliers based throughout Lancashire and the wider North West area
* had 18,390 full-time students residing in the North West who spent a total of £210m throughout the region, with £155m of that being spent in Lancashire.<ref name=UCLanRegeneris />

In 2015, UCLan announced its intention to create historic and transformational change at its Preston Campus through a £200 million development programme entitled '''Campus Masterplan 2020'''. UCLan's vision over the next five years is to create a unified, sustainable and welcoming campus which will enhance the experience for all those visiting the university.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://uclanmasterplan.co.uk/| publisher=University of Central Lancashire| title=Campus Masterplan 2020| access-date=10 February 2020| archive-date=9 January 2021| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109144955/https://uclanmasterplan.co.uk/| url-status=live}}</ref> The long-term vision is to spark a major focus on regeneration and business investment in the university quarter, reinforce the university's ties to the local community and create wider benefits for Preston and beyond.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://uclanmasterplan.co.uk/our-vision/| publisher=University of Central Lancashire| title=Campus Masterplan 2020 – Our Vision| access-date=10 February 2020| archive-date=9 January 2021| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109144955/https://uclanmasterplan.co.uk/our-vision/| url-status=live}}</ref>

September 2019 saw the opening of the £35 million Engineering Innovation Centre (EIC), a facility with integrated teaching and research space.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.uclan.ac.uk/about_us/| publisher=University of Central Lancashire| title=About Us| access-date=10 February 2020| archive-date=9 January 2021| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109145014/https://www.uclan.ac.uk/about-us| url-status=live}}</ref>

Also under development is the £57 million Student Centre and public square, which will provide a new campus reception building housing several student services, meeting rooms, office space, event venues and a rooftop garden. The new public square, provisionally known as ''Adelphi Square'', will span over 8,400 square metres<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.uclan.ac.uk/news/flagship-project.php| publisher=University of Central Lancashire| title=University's flagship project will complete in 2020| date=27 August 2019| access-date=12 February 2020| archive-date=9 January 2021| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109145017/https://www.uclan.ac.uk/news| url-status=live}}</ref> and will be constructed in front of the new student centre and opposite the EIC, on empty land that was previously the site of the Fylde Building and public land bought by UCLan from the council. The project has seen the demolition of existing housing in St Peter's Square opposite the UCLan Library and St Peter's Arts Centre, and redevelopment of the A583 and other nearby public roadways, including the Adelphi roundabout, which will result in revised traffic flows. Construction commenced in the third quarter of 2019 and is expected to be completed in 2021.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://uclanmasterplan.co.uk/highways/| publisher=University of Central Lancashire| title=Campus Masterplan 2020 – Highways| access-date=10 February 2020| archive-date=9 January 2021| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109145026/https://uclanmasterplan.co.uk/highways/| url-status=live}}</ref> On 30 July 2021 UCLan officially took ownership of the new Student Centre and University Square (which had provisionally been known as Adephi Square) when a ceremonial key was presented to the university's Vice-Chancellor, Professor Graham Baldwin, by the project's major contractor [[Bowmer + Kirkland]].

Since city status was awarded in 2002, Preston has been targeted by a number of developers. Residential developments were particularly popular with new apartments planned in and around the city centre. Many of these developments however are still struggling to find buyers for these apartments, and there are rising numbers of repossessions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lep.co.uk/news/Preston-The-city-of-ghosts.6205139.jp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409072212/http://www.lep.co.uk/news/Preston-The-city-of-ghosts.6205139.jp|archive-date=9 April 2010|title=Preston: City Of Ghosts|date=6 April 2010|access-date=26 February 2012}}</ref> Office and hotel space is also in demand and a new Central Business District is being planned as well as a number of new hotels.

[[File: Preston railway station - geograph.org.uk - 5974936.jpg |thumb|Preston Railway Station]]
Preston has a long history with the railways. [[Preston railway station]] opened in 1838 and has since been rebuilt and extended several times. It is a major stop on the [[West Coast Main Line]] between [[London]] and [[Scotland]].

The lines to [[West Lancashire Railway|Southport]] and [[Preston and Longridge Railway|Longridge]] closed to passengers in 1965 and 1930 respectively. The disused tracks of the Longridge line are extant as far as [[Deepdale, Preston|Deepdale]]. In 2010 plans were put forward to use part of this line for a demonstration tram system.<ref>(26 March 2010), [http://www.lep.co.uk/news/tram_system_demo_could_be_in_place_soon_1_752372 "Tram system demo could be in place soon"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613234209/https://www.lep.co.uk/news/tram_system_demo_could_be_in_place_soon_1_752372 |date=13 June 2018 }}, ''Lancashire Evening Post'', Preston.

==== Former stations ====
Although Preston is now only served by its main railway station, in the preceding decades there were a number of other stations which have since closed (and many demolished). The following is a list of former stations which were located within the boundaries of the current day [[City of Preston, Lancashire|City of Preston]]:{{Citation needed|date=October 2022}}

==== New stations ====
In December 2020, the Lancashire County Council approved a proposal to construct a new station in [[Lea, Lancashire|Lea]] west of the city, to service new housing estates being built in the area. The proposed station will be located near the site of the former Lea Road station which closed in 1938. Although a timeline is yet to be established and construction yet to begin, government funding of £22.3M (along with local funding of £21.M) is conditional that it must be spent by 2023.<ref name=LEP_LS>{{cite web |url=https://www.lep.co.uk/news/transport/new-preston-suburban-railway-station-moves-step-closer-3057903 |title=New Preston suburban railway station moves a step closer |publisher=Lancashire Evening Post  |author=Paul Faulkner |date=5 December 2020 |access-date=17 November 2021}}</ref>

==== Preston Dock branch line ====
With the industrialisation of Preston in the 19th century a branch line was built in 1846 from Preston's mail station to carry goods to and from [[Victoria Quay, Preston|Victoria Quay]] on the River Ribble. With the opening of the Albert Edward Basin and the new [[Preston Dock]] in 1892, the number and length of tracks increased and at their peak grew to over 25 miles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prestonstation.org.uk/Docks.html |title=Preston Dock |publisher=Preston Station Past and Present |access-date=15 November 2021}}</ref>

With the closure of the docks in 1981 and its subsequent redevelopment, most of the tracks were removed and now only a small section remains, used by the [[Ribble Steam Railway]] (RSR) and for [[bitumen]] trains operating to and from the [[TotalEnergies|Total]] [[refinery]] at the Riversway industrial park.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ribblesteam.org.uk/news/ribble-steam-railway-and-preston-docks/ |title=Ribble Steam Railway and Preston Docks |publisher=Ribble Steam Railway and Museum |access-date=15 November 2021}}</ref>

A single station, [[Preston Riverside railway station|Preston Riverside]], is operated by the RSR for its heritage rail trips.

The River Ribble has a length of approximately {{convert|75|mi|km}}, originating near the [[Ribblehead Viaduct]] in [[North Yorkshire]], flowing westward and passing through Preston and entering the [[Irish Sea]] at the [[Ribble and Alt Estuaries]] near [[Lytham]], approximately {{convert|11.5|mi|km}} to the west of the city.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

The Ribble has played an important role in the history of Preston. Archaeological evidence confirms human settlement along its banks going back to [[neolithic]] times, as well as the [[Saxon]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] eras. The river was already a trading port by [[medieval]] times, increasing in use and importance in conjunction with the industrialisation of Preston, until the closure of the Port of Preston in 1981.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

The river suffers from an on-going issue of [[sedimentation]], and was regularly [[Dredging|dredged]] downstream of Preston while the city had an active port. Since dredging operations ceased, [[silt]] from the river is now spreading more widely over the beaches of its estuary.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

====Preston Dock====
{{main|Preston Dock}}
Preston Dock was a former [[Dock (maritime)|maritime dock]] located on the northern bank of the River Ribble approximately {{convert|1.6|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of the city centre. It was the location of the Port of Preston at the Albert Edward Basin which opened in 1892 and is connected to the river by a series of [[Lock (water navigation)|locks]]. The dock provided a [[port]] for shipping and ferry operations until its closure in 1981.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

Records show that Preston was already a trading port by the 12th century and from around the mid-14th century ships would come up the river to unload and shelter in a natural basin known in its time as 'Preston Anchorage', where the Moor Brook joined the Ribble. In 1806 the Ribble Navigation Company was formed, and construction of the New Quays wharf (later renamed Victoria Quay) commenced a few years later further downstream along the section of the river where Marsh Lane joined Strand Road.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

Sedimentation and the shallowness of the Ribble limited access to Victoria Quay to when the tide was high, and it was proposed that the river be diverted and an artificial tidal basin created whose water level could be controlled to allow 24-hour loading and unloading operations. In 1884 diversion of the Ribble began along with and the excavation of the what was to be the Albert Edward Basin along its northern bank, and in June 1892 the new Preston Dock was opened. However, the on-going issue of sedimentation required constant dredging of the Ribble and along with loss of trade to large ports around the country, the docks never returned a profit, leading to their closure in October 1981.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

Redevelopment of the former docks began in 1985 and continued through to 1992. Renamed ''Riversway'', the first of the new retail and industrial estates, along with new roads, were opened in July 1987. Development of residential housing commenced in 1989, with the new estate along the basin's southern shore named Victoria Quay after the earlier docks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

These days, the Albert Edward basin is used only for leisure activities, is home to many waterbirds. A public marina is located on its northwestern end, and access to and from the River Ribble is provided through the basin's original locks, operated by the Preston City Council; operating times are seasonal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://prestonmarina.co.uk/index.php/lock-gates/ |title=Lock Gate Opening Times |publisher=Preston Marina |access-date=16 November 2021}}</ref>

====Lancaster Canal====
{{main|Lancaster Canal}}
[[File:Narrowboat_Lancaster_Canal_Preston_20180806.jpg|thumb|A [[narrowboat]] on the [[Lancaster Canal]] at [[Ashton-on-Ribble]]]]
The [[Lancaster Canal]] runs from Preston to [[Kendal]] in [[Cumbria]]. It was originally planned to join the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] at [[Westhoughton]] and while the section north to near [[Chorley]] was built, the section south from Preston was never built. Instead, a "temporary" bridge – which still stands today – was constructed over the Ribble near Avenham Park, and a tramway operated from 1803 to [[Walton Summit]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

From 1820 [[packet boat]]s carried passengers between Preston and Kendal, providing faster journeys than the stagecoaches of the day, and by 1833 travel time had been reduced to seven hours. From the 1930s leakage problems caused sections of the canal, now owned by the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS Railway]], around Kendal to be closed to public traffic. However, the canal remained navigable to coal traffic from Preston to the Kendal Gas Works until 1944, but in 1955 the whole canal was closed to all traffic by an Act of Parliament. Subsequently, sections of the canal were filled in, later to be re-opened as interest in the canal returned, and currently, {{convert|42|mi|km|1}} of the canal from Preston to [[Tewitfield]] near [[Carnforth]] is open to navigation.<ref name=BP_PLC>{{cite web |url=https://www.blogpreston.co.uk/2021/08/prestons-lost-canal-drunk-on-the-packet-boats/ |title=Preston's lost canal, drunk on the packet boats |publisher=Blog Preston |author=Geoffrey Whittaker |date=1 August 2020 |access-date=16 November 2021}}</ref>

At Preston the canal originally terminated at a large boat basin located in the city centre between Marsh Lane and the A59 Ring Road, on the western side of Corporation Street. An aqueduct carried the canal from its current terminus on the northern side of Aqueduct Street in at [[Ashton-on-Ribble]], past the former [[Maudlands railway station]], paralleling the eastern side of the railway to the basin, where railway tracks, long since removed, provided access originally to Victoria Quay and later to the new Preston Dock. Following the [[Second World War]], as many industries around Preston closed, this section of the canal became derelict and in the 1960s it was filled in and a new terminus with mooring facilities built at Ashton. The land through which the canal ran is now the campus of the University of Central Lancashire, with the Sir Tom Finney Sports Centre located over the former boat slip, and the site of the boat basin now a small retail mall with an [[Aldi]] supermarket.<ref name=BP_PLC/>

Originally the canal was isolated from the River Ribble, but this changed in 2002 with the opening of the [[Ribble Link]].

====Ribble Link====
{{main|Ribble Link}}
Opened in July 2002, the Ribble Link is a navigation [[waterway]] built along a section of the [[Savick Brook]] that connects the previously isolated Lancaster Canal to the River Ribble. Featuring a series of [[Lock (water navigation)|locks]], the Link allows narrowboats and other small watercraft to transit between the two waterways.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

The Link is approximately {{convert|4|mi|km}} in length, starting from the Lancaster Canal near [[Ingol]] and entering the Ribble (as the Savick Brook) south of [[Lea, Lancashire|Lea Gate]]. There are eight (8) locks in total, permitting boats up to {{convert|62|ft|m}} length and {{convert|10|ft|6|in|m}} in width to navigate its course.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

Unlike a canal, vessels are not free to travel in either direction at any time. Traffic flow is controlled so that the Link can only be navigated in a specific direction on alternate days. The Link is only open for approximately 90 days between April and October, and is used by approximately 200 boats a year.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

The Link is operated by the [[Canal & River Trust]] and requires annual dredging to remain navigable.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

====Proposed developments====
In 2006 the Preston City Council, in conjunction with the [[South Ribble Borough Council]], proposed a major development estimated at £800 million to redevelop the city's docks and large sections of the River Ribble. Known as ''Riverworks'', the plan proposed new leisure facilities (watersports), landmark buildings, a new central park opposite [[Avenham Park]], office and retail space, new residential developments and the re-opening of some of Preston's old canal with new facilities for a "park and boat ride" scheme. The proposal met with considerable resistance from the local community (with 74% of residents objecting) and leisure and environmental groups due to the potential loss of green space, impact upon ecosystems (especially fish populations) and increased risk of flooding resulted in protests and campaigns being organised to have the project cancelled.<ref>{{cite web| title=Flood plain housing plan slammed| work=Lancashire Evening Post, 30 June 2007| url=http://www.lep.co.uk/news?articleid=2995255| access-date=1 July 2007| archive-date=9 January 2021| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109144945/https://www.lep.co.uk/news| url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/757438.river-plan-protest-walk/ |title=River Plan Protest Walk |publisher=Lancashire Telegraph |author=Emma Mayoh |date=11 May 2006 |access-date=16 November 2021}}</ref>

In December 2007 the Preston City Council pulled out of a major part of the Riversworks plan, the highly contentious [[barrage (dam)|Ribble Barrage]], and stated the revised plan would only look at improving Preston Docklands (in particular, the on-going blue green algae problem) and extending the Lancaster Canal from its current terminus at [[Ashton-on-Ribble|Ashton]] into the city at the back of the University of Central Lancashire (near the site of the former boat basin which was filled in prior to the construction of the current campus).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/1880448.council-pulls-out-of-ribble-barrage-plan/ |title=Council Pulls Out of Ribble Barrage Plan |publisher=Lancashire Telegraph |author=Andrew Greaves |date=4 December 2007 |access-date=16 November 2021}}</ref>

A subsequent change in council's ''Sustainable Community Strategy'', especially in regards to ''Environmental'', ''Health and Well-being'' and  ''People and Communities'' policies and targets, resulted in a ban on development on green belt land, and along with city's new Local Plan, the remaining (re)development proposals within the Riverworks plan were abandoned.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www3.lancashire.gov.uk/council/meetings/displayFile.asp?FTYPE=D&FILEID=25856 |title=Preston Community Strategy 2009–2012 |publisher=Preston Strategic Partnership |access-date=16 November 2021 |archive-date=20 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020081128/http://www3.lancashire.gov.uk/council/meetings/displayFile.asp?FTYPE=D&FILEID=25856 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.preston.gov.uk/media/1952/Preston-s-Local-Plan/pdf/Preston-Local-Plan-2012-2026-_(8).pdf?m=637056240884300000 |title=Preston Local Plan 2012–2026 |publisher=Preston City Council |access-date=16 November 2021}}</ref>

===Roads===
[[File:PrestonCityCentre.jpg|thumb|North Road approaches the city centre from the north]]
[[File:Motorway - geograph.org.uk - 260605.jpg|thumb|right|The [[M6 motorway|M6 Motorway]] at Junction 29]]
{{main|Transport in Preston}}
The [[Preston By-pass]], opened 5 December 1958, became the first stretch of motorway in the UK and is now part of the [[M6 motorway|M6]] with a short section now forming part of the [[M55 motorway|M55]]. It was built to ease traffic congestion caused by tourists travelling to the popular destinations of [[Blackpool]] and [[Lake District|The Lake District]]. The first [[traffic cones]] were used during its construction, replacing red lantern paraffin burners.

In the 1980s, a motorway around the west of the city which would have been an extension of the [[M65 motorway|M65]] to the [[M55 motorway|M55]] was started but never finished. Originally, the [[M55 motorway|M55]] had no junction 2, because it was reserved for this new western bypass; however the construction of junction 2 began in 2019 and will create a link with the [[A583 road|A583]], close to the [[Riversway Docklands]], in order to alleviate traffic on the M55 and the A6 at the Broughton Interchange to the north of Preston. The project is known as the Preston Western Distributor. The [[M6 motorway|M6]] between junctions 30 and 32 was widened extensively between 1993–95 to compensate. Junction 31A which has only a northbound exit and a southbound entry opened in 1997 to serve a nearby business park. Other motorways terminating close to the city are the [[M61 motorway|M61]] – Preston to [[Manchester]] via [[Chorley]] and [[Bolton]],
the [[M65 motorway|M65]] – Preston to [[Colne]] via [[Blackburn]], [[Accrington]] and [[Burnley]] and the [[M55 motorway|M55]] – Preston to [[Blackpool]] via [[Kirkham, Lancashire|Kirkham]].

Preston has several Taxi, Private Hire and Cab Companies serving Preston and surrounding Villages, including Millers, Uber and [http://www.allprestontaxis.co.uk|All Preston Taxis]

In conjunction with car parking facilities at the bus station, local services operate to and from two [[Preston Park & Ride|park and rides]] located on the outskirts of the city to minimise private vehicular traffic in the city centre; one at Portway in the [[Riversway]] area, and the other off the [[A6 road (England)|A6]] at [[Walton-le-Dale]].

[[File:Preston bus station 232-26.jpg|thumb|[[Preston bus station]]]]
Local, regional and national bus services operate from the [[Preston bus station]], which is located on the southeast edge of the city centre off the A59 and claimed by some residents to be the largest or second largest station in Europe.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.lep.co.uk/news/opinion_2_1845/second_best_city_1_162364 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120907104929/http://www.lep.co.uk/news/opinion_2_1845/second_best_city_1_162364 |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 September 2012 |title=Second-best city |access-date=7 July 2010 |newspaper=Lancashire Evening Post }}</ref>

====National and regional bus services====
The national operators [[National Express Coaches|National Express]], [[Eurolines]], and [[Megabus (Europe)|Megabus]] provide services from the bus station to and from various major cities and destination en-route across the United Kingdom.

Stagecoach provides services to the nearby towns and cities of [[Blackpool]], [[Blackburn]], [[Bolton]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], [[Southport]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Wigan|Wigan]] as well as [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] and [[Morecambe]] under the [[Stagecoach in Lancaster]] service.

[[Blackburn Bus Company]], part of the [[Transdev]] group, operates the 152 Hotline route to Blackburn and [[Burnley]]. An independent company, [[John Fishwick & Sons]], that provided frequent services into the city centre from Lower Penwortham, Lostock Hall, Leyland, Euxton and Chorley, ceased trading in October 2015.

====Local bus services====
Many services between Preston and the surrounding area were operated by [[Ribble Motor Services]] which became part of the [[Stagecoach Group]], using the name [[Stagecoach in Lancashire]]. Several of its routes were branded "Preston Citi"; they operated to [[Fulwood, Lancashire|Fulwood]], [[Ribbleton]], [[Penwortham]], [[Longton, Lancashire|Longton]], [[Walton-le-dale]], [[Walmer Bridge]], [[New Longton]], [[Bamber Bridge]], [[Longridge]], [[Chorley]] and [[Leyland, Lancashire|Leyland]]. [[Preston Bus]], formerly the city's [[municipal bus company]], also served the district and operated a route between Preston and Penwortham.

In October 2006, Preston Bus started operating two orbital bus routes.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wsWeedUr5QkC&pg=PA145 |title=Stagecoach Group Plc/Preston Bus Limited: A Report on the Completed Acquisition by Stagecoach Group Plc of Preston Bus Limited |author=[[Competition Commission]] |publisher=The Stationery Office |page=145 |isbn=978-0-11-706375-4 |year=2009 |access-date=29 April 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
[[Preston Bus#History|Competition]] for routes and passengers resulted in a [[bus war]] between the two companies after buses were [[Bus deregulation in the United Kingdom|deregulated]]. On 23 January 2009, Preston Bus was sold to Stagecoach<ref name=bus-hist>{{cite web |url=http://www.prestonbus.co.uk/about/TheHistoryofPublicTransportinPreston_3.html |title=The History of Public Transport in Preston |publisher=Preston Bus |access-date=25 April 2012 |archive-date=9 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109145017/http://www.prestonbus.co.uk/about/TheHistoryofPublicTransportinPreston_3.html |url-status=live }}</ref> for over £10.4 million. Routes were changed and the services were branded [[Stagecoach in Preston]]. Following a lengthy investigation which began soon after the takeover, the Competition Commission ruled on 11 November 2009 that the action by Stagecoach had adversely affected competition in the area and ordered it to sell Preston Bus. In January 2011, [[Rotala]] announced it had agreed to take over Preston Bus.<ref name=bus-hist/>
