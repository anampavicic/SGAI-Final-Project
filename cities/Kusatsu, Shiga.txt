==History==
[[File:Kusatsujuku-honjin Kusatsu Shiga Pref01s3s4500.jpg|right|thumb|260px|Historical site of Kusatsu-juku.]]
Kusatsu is part of ancient  [[Ōmi Province]]. It has been a transportation hub for east-west travel on the ancient [[Tōsandō]] and [[Tōkaidō (road)| Tōkaidō]] highways connecting the capital of [[Heian-kyō]] with the provinces of eastern Japan from the end of the [[Nara period]] onwards. During the [[Muromachi period]], it developed as a relay point between [[Kyoto]] and the [[Ise Grand Shrine]]s. In 1422, when [[Shogun]] [[Ashikaga Yoshimochi]] made a pilgrimage to Ise, he built a palace, the "Kusatsu Goshō" in this location. Around 1568, [[Oda Nobunaga]] forced [[Ashikaga Yoshiaki]] to cede the Kusatsu area, which he viewed as strategically critical to controlling the approaches to Kyoto. Nobunaga made extensive road repairs and reconstructed the [[Seta Bridge]]. In the early [[Edo period]], the system of [[shukuba|post stations]] on the [[Nakasendō]] and Tōkaidō was formalized by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in 1602.  Kusatsu-juku developed at the junction of these two highways as a post town from around this time.

The town of Kusatsu was established within [[Kurita District, Shiga]] with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. On October 15, 1954, Kusatsu merged with the neighboring villages of Shizu, Oikami, Yamada, Kasanei and Tokiwa to form the city of Kusatsu.

==Government==
Kusatsu has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 24 members. Kusatsu contributes four members to the Shiga Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Shiga 3rd district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Kusatsu is a regional commercial center and an important traffic junction of southern Shiga; [[Biwako Line]], [[Kusatsu Line]], [[Meishin Expressway]], [[Shin-Meishin Expressway]], [[Japan National Route 1]] and [[Japan National Route 8]]. The city is 30 minutes from Kyoto and 51 minutes from [[Osaka]], and is classified by the [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism]] as part of the greater Kyoto Metropolitan area, thus has increasingly become a [[commuter town]].

==Education==
Kusatsu has 14 public elementary schools and six public middle schools operated by the city government and four public high schools operated by the Shiga Prefectural Department of Education. The prefecture also operates one special education school for the handicapped. There are also one private middle school and two private high schools. [[Ritsumeikan University]] of Kyoto has a subcampus in Kusatsu.
