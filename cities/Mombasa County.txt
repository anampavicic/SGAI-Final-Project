'''Mombasa County''' is one of the 47 [[counties of Kenya]] and has its capital in [[Mombasa]]. In terms of economy it is second after Nairobi.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|title=Events – Mombasa County|date=30 May 2018 |url=http://www.mombasa.go.ke/events/events/|language=en-US|access-date=28 May 2020}}</ref> Initially it was one of the former [[districts of Kenya]] but in 2013 it was reconstituted as a county, on the same boundaries. It is the smallest county in Kenya, covering an area of 229.7&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> excluding 65&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of water mass. The county is situated in the south eastern part of the former [[Coast Province]], bordering [[Kilifi County]] to the north, [[Kwale County]] to the south west and the [[Indian Ocean]] to the east.  Administratively, the county is divided into seven divisions, eighteen locations and thirty sub-locations.

Kenya was divided into eight [[Provinces of Kenya|provinces]] prior to 2013, which were subdivided into 47 counties. In the former [[Coast Province]] there are six counties, Mombasa being one of them. It is situated in the southeast of Coast Province. It is the smallest in size, covering an area of 212.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref>[http://www.unep.org/dewa/water/GroundWater/English/GWhmEng/Country%20Profiles/Kenya/Kenya.doc unep.org – Country-Profile Kenya] (.doc)</ref> The county lies between latitudes 3°56′ and 4°10′ south of the equator and longitudes 39°34′ and 39°46′ east.<ref name="auto"/>
