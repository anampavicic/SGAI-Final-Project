'''Bayugan''', officially the '''City of Bayugan''' ({{lang-ceb|Dakbayan sa Bayugan}}; {{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Bayugan}}), is a 1st class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Agusan del Sur]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 109,499 people.{{PH census|current}}.

Gained cityhood through Republic Act No. 9405,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Republic Act No. 9405|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2007/03/23/republic-act-no-9405/|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=officialgazette}}</ref> it is the only city in the province of Agusan del Sur and also the most populous.

Located at the northern part of Agusan del Sur, Bayugan is the "cut-flower capital" of the province owing to its lucrative [[cut flower]] industry. The city's climate, especially in the highland barangays, is conducive to high yield cut-flower production. The city is also one of the major producers of rice and vegetables in the province, even providing for neighboring municipalities and provinces.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Etymology==

The natives called the area Bayugan since the word ''bayugan'' is a [[Manobo]] term for pathway. Another version states that ''bayug'' trees used to grow abundantly in the area. It was also believed that the natives used to make this place their meeting spot and that the means of gathering the inhabitants was by knocking on a hollow piece of wood which they termed as the ''bayug''.

==History==
Bayugan was formerly a sitio of Barangay Maygatasan, [[Esperanza, Agusan del Sur|Esperanza]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://agusandelsur.gov.ph/index/governance/2011-11-17-16-33-48/2011-08-15-05-52-42/bayugan-city|title=City of Bayugan}}</ref> Several versions abound on how the sitio got its name. First, the place was located along the river which served as the pathway of the natives in going to Esperanza.

In 1942, Japanese troops entered Bayugan during the [[World War II|second World War]].

In 1945, the town of Bayugan in Southern Agusan was liberated by Filipino soldiers and guerrillas from the Japanese forces occupying the town.

In 1948, the Department of Public Works and Highways conducted a survey for a [[Pan-Philippine Highway|National Highway]] that would connect [[Butuan]] with [[Davao City]]. Simultaneously, the Bureau of Lands surveyed the places that would be traversed by the proposed road. Possible town sites were identified and among them was Barangay Maygatasan. However, part of the National Highway (now the Narra Avenue) passed through the sitio of Bayugan instead of Barangay Maygatasan. Migrants started settling in the sitio of Bayugan, thus, prompting the transfer of the proposed town site.

In the early part of 1960, the inhabitants led by Mr. Jose Joson passed a resolution creating the sitio of Bayugan into a regular barrio. In April of that year, Barangay Bayugan was inaugurated with Joson as the Teniente del Barrio. Brought about by the construction of the National Highway which traversed the place, business activity sprouted rapidly in the area.

A year later, barangay officials led by then Sergio Mullaneda worked out the creation of Bayugan into a regular municipality through the assistance of Governor Democrito O. Plaza, Governor of Agusan. By virtue of Executive Order No. 440 of then President [[Carlos P. Garcia]], the petition to create the municipality of Bayugan was granted on August 6, 1961. Mr. Mullaneda, the first appointed Municipal Mayor of Bayugan assumed into office on August 6, 1962, during the term of President [[Diosdado Macapagal]]. In the year 2007 Bayugan was converted to a city.

Bayugan is a transportation highway nexus for the eastern part of [[Mindanao]] Island. Bayugan is now one if not the fastest growing component city in North Eastern [[Mindanao]].

In 2024, a 65-year-old named Rosa was decapitated in Brgy. Canayugan for planting her [[Bougainvillea|bougainvilleas]] by a neighbor because the thorns of the flowers poked him on the chest.<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l6nnaWq_cI |title=Lola, pinugutan ng ulo para diumano ipangregalo sa mga kainuman?! {{!}} Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho |date=2024-01-09 |last=GMA Public  Affairs |access-date=2024-07-28 |via=YouTube}}</ref>

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
{{Hatnote|For further information, see [[League of Cities of the Philippines v. COMELEC]].}}
[[File:Bayugan proper 2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Narra Avenue]]
On July 24, 2006, the [[Philippine Congress|congress]] approved R.A. 9405, an act converting the Municipality of Bayugan into a component city to be known as the City of Bayugan.

But in 2008, the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] declared the law unconstitutional. The court ruled that Bayugan, along with the other fifteen cities covered by the law did not meet the requirements for cityhood.

More than a year later, on December 22, 2009, acting favorably on the appeal of the sixteen affected cities, the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] reversed its earlier ruling. It deemed that the passage of the amendatory law regarding the criteria for cityhood as set by congress specifically exempting a particular political subdivision therefrom was constitutional. The court further ruled that congress, in enacting the exempting law, effectively decreased the already codified indicators. As such, the cityhood status of Bayugan, and the rest of the fifteen local government units was restored.

But again on August 24, 2010, in a 16-page resolution, the court reinstated its November 18, 2008 decision striking down the constitutionality of Republic Act 9405. Voting 7–6, with two justices abstaining, the court reinstated its decision declaring RA 9405 as unconstitutional.

However, in another twist of fate for Bayugan, the court once again upheld for the third and final time the constitutionality of RA 9405 on February 15, 2011, thereby finalizing the cityhood of Bayugan and the other fifteen municipalities affected by the law.  On July 3, 2011, the court ordered its clerk of court to issue an entry of judgment on the cityhood case, sealing with finality the constitutionality of the law.
<ref>Republic Act 9405</ref>

After six years of legal battle, in its board resolution, the [[League of Cities of the Philippines]] acknowledged and recognized the cityhood of Bayugan and 15 other cities.

==Geography==
Bayugan is bordered by the Municipality of [[Sibagat, Agusan del Sur|Sibagat]] and the province of [[Surigao del Sur]] to the north; the Municipality of [[Prosperidad, Agusan del Sur|Prosperidad]] to the east; the Municipality of [[Esperanza, Agusan del Sur|Esperanza]] to the south; and the Municipality of [[Las Nieves, Agusan del Norte]], to the west.
