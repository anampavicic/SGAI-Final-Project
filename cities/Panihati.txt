==History==
There is a legendary belief that Maharaja Chandraketu of Deganga established a ''garh'' (fort) at Panihati in the 13th century. There is an association of goddess Bhawani with the fort. In the early days when river transport was the primary means of communication, Panihati was a major trading and business centre, then known as Pannyahati (Emporium for Merchandise). Scholars feel that the name has come from the word Pannyahatic. Panihati is mentioned in several [[Vaishnava Padavali]] literary texts – ''Chaitanya Mangal Kavya'' by Jayananda and Lochandas in the 16th century,  ''Sri Chaitanya Bhagawat'' by Brindaban Das in 1548, ''Bansi Bistar'' by Nityannda, ''Vaishnava Namdeva'' by Debaki Nandan, ''Sri Chaitanya Charitamritam'' by Krishnadas Kabiraj in 1580–1610, ''Bhakti Ratnakar'' and ''Chaitanya Chandroday''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://panihatimunicipality.in/html/origin-name.html  | title = Panihati Municipality | work = Historical background | publisher = PM  | access-date =  25 June 2018}}</ref> Panihati Municipality was established in 1900.<ref name=municipality>{{cite web | url = http://barrackpore.gov.in/HTM/sdobkp_Panihati%20Municipality.htm | title = Panihati Municipality  | publisher =  Barrackpore administration | access-date =  25 June 2018}}</ref> This place is said to be visited by Sri [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] on his way to [[Puri]] & later by his close associate [[Nityananda]] too, due to which [[Gaudiya Vaishnavas]] consider this place holy.

[[Gandhi Memorial Asram]] or ''Sodepur Khadi Pratisthan'' was established by Satish Chandra Dasgupta in 1921 at Panihati. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] himself visited  and stayed there several times in 1939, 1945, 1946 and 1947.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Gandhi Memorial Asram|url=https://wbhc.in/home/place_details/NWQyMTJmZWYxMDllZTczMDcxNmM2M2NjYmViZDZmOWNjM2U3NmNkZjJhOTIwZTgxNjI3ZjY5ZWIwYWQ1MzE0NWExNDcyNTJmMWI4YmQyYzk0ODg3YTZkNDlmNWJmZTNjYWI5NWMyMmM2MmFjMTZkMGRlZjY3YzQyMDFmZmE5MWFqVEtYdzZjdFJBSEhYYXhkL2phYXJaMXF4UzU5RnAycGQ1aFJqUlNDRTBzPQ==|access-date=2021-08-29|website=West Bengal Heritage Commission|language=en-IN}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=:: Welcome to Panihati Municipality ::|url=https://panihatimunicipality.in/html/m-gandhi.html|access-date=2021-08-29|website=panihatimunicipality.in}}</ref>
