'''Buenaventura''' is a coastal seaport city located in the [[Pacific/Chocó natural region|Pacific Region]] of the department of [[Valle del Cauca]], [[Colombia]] ([[South America]]). Buenaventura (Spanish for "good adventure") is the main port of [[Colombia]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-sep-21-fg-colombia-port21-story.html|title=Colombian crackdown appears to be paying off|first=Chris|last=Kraul|date=21 September 2009|access-date=19 April 2018|via=LA Times}}</ref>

As of the 2018 census, Buenaventura has a population of 235,064.<ref>[https://www.citypopulation.de/en/colombia/valledelcauca/76109__buenaventura/ Citypopulation.de] Population of Buenaventura municipality with localities</ref> Most of the urban development takes place on Cascajal Island, while the majority of the city's land is rural with scattered, small villages. It is served by the [[Gerardo Tobar López Airport]].

The city is part of the [[Creative Cities Network|UNESCO Creative Cities Network]] after it was named a "City of Gastronomy" in 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/travel/buenaventura-colombia-pacific-coast.html|title=Once Colombia's 'Deadliest City,' Buenaventura Is Coming Back|work=The New York Times |date=9 July 2018 |access-date=2018-10-03|language=en|last1=Kugel |first1=Seth }}</ref>

==History==
The city was founded on July 14, 1540, by [[Juan Ladrillero]] through orders from [[Pascual de Andagoya]]. Its name, Buenaventura, is Spanish for “good luck”. At that time, it was inhabited by an indigenous tribe called the Buscaja Indians.

The city was destroyed by Indigenous Americans before 1600{{why|date=July 2019}}; it was later rebuilt.  Buenaventura thrived after the opening of the [[Panama Canal]] in 1914; and in the 1950s became a regular stopover for the 'international jet set'. Today, the city is crucial for sending raw materials to nearby areas; this has brought prosperity and allowed recent new development to occur.

==Demographics==
===Ethnic Composition===
According to the 2018 [[DANE Colombia|DANE census]], its demographic composition is as follows:<ref>{{Cite web|title=DANE demographics Buenaventura, Colombia 2018|url=https://geoportal.dane.gov.co/cnpv2018/?lt=3.6487683440769505&lg=-77.10869688049996&z=9}}{{Dead link|date=October 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

[[African diaspora|Afro-Colombian]]: 220,318 (85.25%)

[[White people|Whites]] and [[Mestizo]]s: 29,825 (11.54%)

No response: 4,289 (1.66%)

[[Indigenous peoples in Colombia|Indigenous]]: 3,919 (1.52%)

[[Raizal]]: 48 (0.02%)

[[Palenquero]]: 33 (0.01%)

[[Romani people|Romani]]: 13 (0.01%)

There are ten indigenous reservations fully or partly within Buenaventura. They belong to [[Emberá people]], specifically to [[Wounaan language|Waunana]] and [[Chami language|Chami]] sub-tribes.

==Transport==
===Port===
The city is one of the major ports on the continent, accounting for nearly 60% of all Colombian sea imports and exports.<ref name="news.vice.com">{{cite web|url=https://social.tuloimportas.com/directorios-de-carga/home|title=Buenaventura: Dismemberment and Displacement (Full Length) - VICE News|website=VICE News|access-date=19 April 2018}}</ref> However, due to its strategic position, the city's economy has been hampered by gang-related activity fighting over control of the port, making it among the most impoverished cities in Colombia.<ref name="news.vice.com"/>

===Rivers===
The city is surrounded by rivers, including: the Dagua; the Anchicayá; the Calima; the Raposo; the Mayorquín; the Cajambre; the Yurumanguí; and part of the right arm of the Naya River and part of the left arm of the River San Juan at its mouth. In addition, it has many streams and smaller rivers, such as Agua Clara, San Marcos, Sabaletas, San Cipriano and Escalerete, which supplies the municipal capital through an aqueduct.

===Road===
Well paved and maintained roads, that are designed to be unaffected by landslides, leave the city via Loboguerrero, where it divides to go to [[Cali]], or [[Buga, Valle del Cauca|Buga]] and then onwards to the cities of [[Armenia, Colombia|Armenia]], [[Medellín]] and [[Bogotá]]. This route is known as "La Vía al Mar", as it connects the parts of the country together.

===Airport===
[[Gerardo Tobar López Airport]] connects Buenaventura with direct flights to [https://tuloimportas.com/aeropuerto-el-dorado/ dorado airport] of 1 hour 20 minutes to [[Bogotá]] via Satena, as well as to other cities.

==Crime==
{{Further|Crime in Colombia}}
Buenaventura has had a notorious history plagued by the [[Colombian armed conflict]], drug trafficking, violence, and the presence of guerrilla and paramilitary groups.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6951683.stm|title=Colombia's new urban drugs war|date=18 August 2007|access-date=19 April 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

Colombian authorities have seized almost US$28 million in cash from drug kingpins. The money found was in several shipping containers sent from [[Manzanillo, Colima]] ([[Mexico]]) and [[Houston]] ([[United States]]), that belonged to brothers Luis Enrique and Javier Antonio Calle Serna, also known as the ‘Combas’.<ref>http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news/news/5946-colombian-authorities-hauled-drug-money-almost-us-28-million.html {{Dead link|date=February 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://tuloimportas.com/tipos-de-contenedores/|title=U.S. Targets Powerful, Profitable "Super Cartel"|website=cbsnews.com|access-date=19 April 2018}}</ref>

Between 2008 and 2010, the number of reported homicides in the city doubled. In 2010, the murder rate of Buenaventura was 175.2 homicides per 100,000, a rate 5 times the national average.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/VC.IHR.PSRC.P5?locations=CO| title=Intentional homicides (Per 100,000 people) - Colombia &#124; Data }}</ref>  To counter the violence, the Colombian government has set up a marine special forces unit in the worst area of the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/world/americas/25colombia.html|title=Bomb Kills at Least 6 in Port City in Colombia|agency=Reuters|newspaper=The New York Times|date=24 March 2010|access-date=19 April 2018}}</ref> In 2011, it seemed that counter-violence efforts had improved crime metrics, even while aspects of the Colombian drug war in that city worsened. According to community activist Victor Hugo Vidal, "If you ask the authorities, they will tell you [the city] is better -- that the homicide rates are way down. But for us [living here], during the last 10 years, there has been no change."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/08/colombias-invisible-war/242775/|title=Colombia's Invisible War|first=Elizabeth|last=Dickinson|website=theatlantic.com|date=August 2011|access-date=19 April 2018}}</ref>
