The new towns are mostly administered by the national level [[New Urban Communities Authority]] (NUCA), with some public services under the jurisdiction of Giza. They are confusingly named ''madina'' (city), however they are not administratively incorporated as such where many are formed of a single district or qism. Ones not in the 2017 census as they were not yet incorporated, or inhabited at that time are:

== Geography and Climate==
Giza's most famous landform and archaeological site, the [[Giza Plateau]], holds some major monuments of [[History of Egypt|Egyptian history]], and is home to the [[Great Sphinx]]. Once thriving with the [[Nile]] that flowed right into the Giza Plateau, the [[Giza Necropolis|pyramids of Giza]] were built overlooking the [[ancient Egyptian]] capital city of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], across the river from modern day Cairo. The Great Pyramid of Giza at one time was advocated (1884) as the location for the [[Prime Meridian]], a reference point used for determining a base longitude.<ref>''"The Canary Islands and the Question of the Prime Meridian: The Search for Precision in the Measurement of the Earth"'', Wilcomb E. Washburn. [http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/geo/WASHBR04.GEO link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529031631/http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/geo/WASHBR04.GEO |date=29 May 2007 }}</ref>

===Climate===
Giza experiences a [[hot desert climate|hot desert]] like [[arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification system|Köppen]]: BWh). Its climate is similar to Cairo, owing to its proximity. Windstorms can be frequent across [[climate of Egypt|Egypt]] in spring, bringing [[mineral dust|Saharan dust]] into the city during the months of March and April. High temperatures in winter range from {{convert|16|to|20|°C|0|abbr=on}}, while nighttime lows drop to below {{convert|7|°C|0|abbr=on}}. In summer, the highs are {{convert|40|°C|0|abbr=on}}, and the lows can drop to about {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Rain is infrequent in Giza; snow is extremely rare.

Up to August 2013, the highest recorded temperature was {{convert|46|C}} on 13 June 1965, while the lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|2|C}} on 8 January 1966.<ref name="Voodoo Skies">{{cite web|title=El-Giza, Egypt|url=http://voodooskies.com/weather/egypt/el-giza|publisher=Voodoo Skies|access-date=16 August 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029183711/http://voodooskies.com/weather/egypt/el-giza|archive-date=29 October 2013}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Giza-pyramids.JPG|thumb|The [[Giza pyramid complex]]]]

===Ancient era===

The area in what is now Giza served as the necropolis of several [[pharaohs]] who ruled [[ancient Egypt]], during the second millennium BC. Three of these tombs, in the form of giant pyramids, are what is now the famed [[Giza pyramid complex]], featuring the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]].

===Classical to medieval era===

As ancient Egypt passed under several conquests under the Persians, Greeks, Romans and Byzantines, so did the area in what is now Giza. A Byzantine village named ''Phylake'' ({{Langx|el|Φυλακή}}) or ''Terso'' ({{Langx|cop|ϯⲣⲥⲱ}}, meaning "the fortress", now ''Tersa'') was located south of Giza and should not be confused with it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trismegistos.org/place/10908|title=TM Places|website=www.trismegistos.org|access-date=18 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190418092737/https://www.trismegistos.org/place/10908|archive-date=18 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>موسوعة " القاموس الجغرافى للبلاد المصرية " – محمد رمزى بك (قسم ثانى ج3 – ص4): مركز وثائق وتاريخ مصر المعاصر الهيئة المصرية العامةللكتاب ط 1994

As [[Muslims]] of the fledgling [[Islamic]] [[Rashidun Caliphate|caliphate]] went on with their conquest of Egypt from the Byzantine Empire beginning in 639 AD, three years after their victory at the [[battle of Yarmouk]] in 636 AD, they conquered all of the land by the time they [[Siege of Alexandria 641|captured]] the city of [[Alexandria]] in 641 AD. A year later in 642 AD ([[Hijri year|year]] 21 in Islamic calendar), they founded the city of Giza. The exact etymology of its name is unknown. [[Al-Maqrizi]] suggested an irregular Arameo-Arabic root meaning "edge, side" to be the source. Everett-Heath suggested {{Langx|egy|r-gs-ḥr}}  "on the side of the height (pyramid)". Peust also suggests a Persian etymology of the word from {{Langx|pal|𐭣𐭦|lit=fortress, castle|translit=diz}}, which Persians could have given to the pyramids or a fortress they found in the area.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Die Toponyme vorarabischen Ursprungs im modernen Ägypten|url=http://www.peust.de/ortsnamen_original.pdf|last=Peust|first=Carsten|access-date=13 May 2020|archive-date=9 October 2022|archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.peust.de/ortsnamen_original.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Infrastructure==
[[File:Giza-sunset.JPG|200px|thumb|Sunset in Giza]]
Giza has seen many changes over time. Changes in infrastructure during the different occupations of [[Egypt]] by various rulers, including the British in the 18th and early 20th century, focused on the construction of [[roads]], streets, and [[buildings]] in the area. Giza is a thriving centre of [[Culture of Egypt|Egyptian culture]] and is quite heavily populated, with many facilities and buildings in the current area. Giza saw much attention in particular to its vast amount of [[ancient Egypt]]ian monuments found on the [[Giza Plateau]], and has astonished thousands of visitors and tourists over the years. Giza's infrastructure saw much attention from both the British government prior to the 1952 coup d'état, as well as the current Egyptian government due to the city's importance in tourism. Giza's St. George Cathedral is the [[episcopal see]] of the [[Coptic Catholic Eparchy of Giza]].

The city hosts the first zoo on the entire African continent and one of the oldest in the [[Mediterranean]] region, the [[Giza Zoo]]. In addition, there are several parks, the most famous among them is Orman Park, which means "Forest Park" in the [[Turkish language]].

===Transportation===
[[File:Metro-1-l.jpg|thumb|right|The Cairo Metro (line 2)]]
Transportation in Giza comprises an extensive road network, rail system, subway system, and maritime services. Road transport is facilitated by personal vehicles, taxi cabs, privately owned public buses and microbuses.

Giza shares with Cairo [[Cairo Metro|a subway system]], officially called the "Metro (مترو)", a fast and efficient way of getting around. An extensive road network connects Giza with [[6th of October City]], Cairo and other cities. There are flyovers and bridges such as the 15th. Traffic in Giza is known to be overwhelming and overcrowded.

===International access===
Access to the city of Giza, which has its own [[governorate]] adjacent to the Governorate of Cairo, is dependent on the [[Cairo International Airport]]. Another local airport is found in Giza, called the [[Embaba Airport|Imbaba Airport]], but recently the Egyptian government has decided to shut down the area and turn it into a cultural or an athletic area.

[[Sphinx International Airport]] was opened in 2018 as an alternative to the already congested Cairo International Airport, but also to improve accessibility to the Giza necropolis as well as to the [[Grand Egyptian Museum]].
