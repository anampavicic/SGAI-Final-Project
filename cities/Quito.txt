'''Quito''' ({{IPA|es|ˈkito|-|ES - Quito.ogg}}; {{langx|qu|Kitu}}), officially '''San Francisco de Quito''', is the [[capital city|capital]] of [[Ecuador]], with an estimated population of 2.8 million in its metropolitan area. It is also the capital of the province of [[Pichincha Province|Pichincha]]. Quito is located in a valley on the eastern slopes of [[Pichincha (volcano)|Pichincha]],<ref>{{Cite web |date=27 April 2022 |title=Guagua Pichincha |url=https://www.igepn.edu.ec/guagua-pichincha |website=Instituto Geofísico, Escuela Politécnica Nacional}}</ref> an active [[stratovolcano]] in the [[Andes]].

Quito's elevation of {{cvt|2850|m|ft|abbr=off|order=out}} makes it either the [[List of capital cities by altitude|highest]] or the second highest capital city in the world. This varied standing is because [[Bolivia]] is a [[List of countries with multiple capitals|country with multiple capitals]]; if [[La Paz]] is considered the Bolivian national capital, it tops the list of highest capitals, but if [[Sucre]] is specified as the capital, then it is the second highest, behind Quito.<ref name="Contact Us">"[http://www.tame.com.ec/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=134&Itemid=18&lang=en Contact Us]." TAME. Retrieved on 14 March 2010.</ref><ref>[[La Paz]] is the administrative capital of [[Bolivia]] and is higher than Quito while [[Sucre]] is the constitutional capital of Bolivia and is lower than Quito.</ref>

Quito is the political and cultural center of [[Ecuador]] as the country's major governmental, administrative, and cultural institutions are located within the city. The majority of transnational companies with a presence in Ecuador are headquartered there. It is also one of the country's two major industrial centers—the port city of [[Guayaquil]] being the other one.

The date of its first habitation is unknown, but archaeological evidence suggests that it was first settled by sedentary populations between 4400 and 1600 BC.<ref>{{Cite web |date=16 November 2019 |title=Encuentran indicios de los primeros habitantes de Quito, Ecuador |url=https://redhistoria.com/encuentran-indicios-de-los-primeros-habitantes-de-quito-ecuador/ |access-date=28 April 2022 |website=Red Historia |language=es}}</ref> In the late fifteenth century, the Inca Emperor [[Huayna Capac]] defeated the [[Quitu culture|Quitu]], the region's original inhabitants, and incorporated Quito into the [[Inca Empire]], designating it into the capital of the Inca Empire's northern region. The Spanish conquest of the city in 1534 is the date most frequently cited as the city's official founding, making Quito the oldest capital in [[South America]].

Quito's historic center is among the largest and best-preserved in [[the Americas]].<ref name="unesco">{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/2 |title=City of Quito – UNESCO World Heritage |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |access-date=30 April 2010}}</ref> In 1978, Quito and [[Kraków]] were the first [[World Heritage|World Cultural Heritage Sites]] declared by [[UNESCO]].<ref name="unesco" /> Quito is the capital city closest to the [[Equator]], which runs through the northern part of the [[Quito Canton|metropolitan area]] in the parish of [[San Antonio de Pichincha|San Antonio]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Quito|List of buildings in Quito}}

===Pre-Columbian period===
The oldest traces of human presence in Quito were excavated by American archeologist Robert E. Bell in 1960, on the slopes of the Ilaló volcano, located between the eastern valleys of Los Chillos and Tumbaco. Hunter-gatherers left tools of obsidian glass, dated to 8000 BC. This archeological site, called ''EI Inga,'' was brought to Robert Bell's attention by Allen Graffham. As a geologist in Ecuador, Graffham pursued his amateur interest in archeology. He made surface collections at the site during 1956.<ref name="samnoblemuseum.ou.edu">{{cite web |url=http://samnoblemuseum.ou.edu/publications/robert-e-bell-archaeological-investigation-at-the-site-of-ei-inga-ecuador/ |title=Robert E. Bell Archaeological Investigation at the Site of EI Inga, Ecuador {{!}} Sam Noble Museum |website=Sam Noble Museum |date=6 February 2015 |language=en-US |access-date=30 June 2017}}</ref> The discovery of projectile points, particularly specimens with basal fluting, stimulated his interest, and he made several visits to the site to collect surface materials. Graffham's previous interest in Paleo-Indian remains, and his experience with early human-made materials in Kansas and Nebraska in the Central Plains of the United States, led him to believe that the site was an important discovery.<ref name="samnoblemuseum.ou.edu"/>

The second important vestige of human settlement was found in the current neighborhood of Cotocollao (1500 BC), northwest of Quito. The prehistoric village covered over 26 hectares in an area irrigated by many creeks. Near the ancient rectangular houses, there are burials with pottery and stone offerings. The Cotocollao people extracted and exported [[obsidian]] to the coastal region.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://eclass.uoa.gr/modules/document/ |title=The Cambridge Prehistory of Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela |last=Lleras |first=Roberto}}</ref>

The priest [[Juan de Velasco]] wrote about a Kingdom of Quito. His source was a lost work by [[Marcos de Niza]], the existence of which has not been confirmed. His account said that another people, known as the [[Cara people|Cara]] or the Schyris, came from the coast and took over the entire region by AD 890. He goes on by saying that this kingdom lasted until the [[Inca]] took over the territory in the 15th century. However archeological evidence does not indicate unity among the different ethnic groups in the region. The local [[Quitu culture|Quitu]] or Quillaco tribe is distinct in its art and architecture from its neighbors.

By the 20th century, many prominent historians who began more academic studies, doubted the account of the Quitu-Cara kingdom. They think it was a legendary pre-Hispanic account of the highlands.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rostworowski |first=María |title=History of the Inca Realm |publisher=Cambridge University Press |translator-last=Iceland |translator-first=Harry B.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Porras Barrenechea |first=Raúl |title=Los cronistas del Perú}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=González Suárez |first=Federico |title=Historia General del Ecuador}}</ref>

These days most historians deny the existence of the kingdom of Quito in favor of a more fragmented region. The Quitu ruled over Quito at the time of the Inca invasion by [[Topa Inca Yupanqui]] under the reign of his father.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cabello de Balboa |first=Miguel |title=Miscelánea antártica}}</ref> In the early 21st century, there were spectacular new finds of 20-meter deep tombs in the La Florida neighborhood of Quito. Dating to AD 800, they provide evidence of the high quality of craftsmanship among the Quitu, and of the elaborate and complex character of their funerary rites. In 2010, the Museo de Sitio La Florida opened to preserve some of the artifacts from the tombs and explain this complex culture.<ref name="tumbas">{{Cite web |url=http://www.eltiempo.com.ec/noticias-cuenca/50199-tumbas-de-los-quitus-dejan-al-descubierto-una-cultura-brillante/ |title=El Telégrafo}}</ref>

{{Main|Urban evolution of colonial Quito}}
[[Inca]]n uprising against the [[colonization of the Americas|Spanish]] continued during 1534. The [[conquistador]] [[Diego de Almagro]] founded Santiago de Quito (in present-day Colta, near [[Riobamba]]) on 15 August 1534, renamed as San Francisco de Quito on 28 August 1534. The city was later refounded at its present location on 6 December 1534 by 204 settlers led by [[Sebastián de Benalcázar]], who captured leader [[Rumiñahui (Inca warrior)|Rumiñahui]], effectively ending all organized resistance.<ref>{{cite web |title=City |publisher=Quito Distrito Metropolitano |url=http://www.quito.gob.ec/ciudad/c_ciudad2.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013212725/http://www.quito.gob.ec/ciudad/c_ciudad2.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 October 2017 |access-date=2 August 2008 |language=es}}</ref> Rumiñahui was executed on 10 January 1535.

On 28 March 1541, Quito was declared a city. Further, on 23 February 1556, it was given the title ''Muy Noble y Muy Leal Ciudad de San Francisco de Quito'' ("Very Noble and Loyal City of San Francisco of Quito"), marking the start of its next phase of [[Urban Evolution of Colonial Quito|urban development]]. In 1563 Quito became the seat of a ''Real Audiencia'' (administrative district) of Spain. It was classified as part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] until 1717, after which the ''Audiencia'' was part of the new [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]]. Under both Viceroyalties, the district was administered from Quito, (see [[Real Audiencia de Quito]]).

The Spanish established [[Roman Catholicism]] in Quito. The first church (''El Belén'') was built before the city was officially founded. In January 1535 the San Francisco Convent was constructed, the first of about 20 churches and convents built during the colonial period. The Spanish converted the indigenous population to Christianity and used them as labor for construction.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In 1743, after nearly 210 years of Spanish colonization, Quito was a city of about 10,000 inhabitants.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} Quito briefly proclaimed its de facto independence from Spain between 1765 and 1766 during the [[Quito Revolt of 1765|Quito Revolt]]. On 10 August 1809, a movement was again started in Quito to win independence from Spain. On that date a plan for government was unveiled, which appointed [[Juan Pío Montúfar]] as president and prominent pro-independence figures in other government positions. 
 
This initial movement was defeated on [[:es:Motín del 2 de agosto de 1810|2 August 1810]], when colonial troops arrived from [[Lima]], [[Peru]], and killed the leaders of the uprising and about 200 other settlers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} A chain of conflicts climaxed on 24 May 1822, when [[Antonio José de Sucre]], under the command of [[Simón Bolívar]], led troops into the [[Battle of Pichincha]], on the slopes of the volcano. Their victory established the independence of Quito and the surrounding areas.

===Republican Ecuador===
In 1833, members of the Society of Free Inhabitants of Quito were assassinated by the government after they conspired against it. On 6 March 1845, the [[Marcist Revolution]] began. In 1875 the country's president, [[Gabriel García Moreno]], was assassinated in Quito. Two years later, in 1877, Archbishop [[José Ignacio Checa y Barba]] was killed by poison while celebrating Mass in Quito.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

In 1882, insurgents rose up against the regime of dictator [[Ignacio de Veintimilla]]. However, this did not end the violence that was occurring throughout the country. On 9 July 1883, the liberal commander [[Eloy Alfaro]] participated in the [[Battle of Guayaquil]], and after further conflict he became the president of Ecuador on 4 September 1895. Upon completing his second term in 1911, he moved to Europe. He returned to Ecuador in 1912 and attempted to return to power unsuccessfully; he was arrested on 28 January 1912, and imprisoned, then lynched by a [[Gang|mob]] that stormed the prison. His body was dragged through the streets of Quito to a city park, where it was burned.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

In 1932, the [[Ecuadorian Civil War of 1932|Four Days' War]] broke out. This was a civil war that followed the election of [[Neptalí Bonifaz]] and the subsequent realization that he carried a Peruvian passport. On 12 February 1949, a realistic broadcast of [[H. G. Wells]]' novel ''[[The War of the Worlds (novel)|The War of the Worlds]]'' led to citywide panic, and the deaths of more than twenty people who died in fires set by mobs.<ref>{{cite book |first=Robert J. |last=Brown |title=Manipulating the Ether |pages=251–252 |publisher=McFarland |year=2004 |isbn=0-7864-2066-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Episode 200: We Interrupt This Program (11.4.2022) |website=Criminal |date=4 November 2022 |url=https://thisiscriminal.com/episode-200-we-interrupt-this-program-11-4-2022/ |access-date=22 November 2022}}</ref>

===21st century===
In 2011, the city's population was 2,239,191 people. Since 2002, the city has been renewing its historic center. The old airport, built on filling in a lagoon, was closed to air traffic on 19 February 2013. The area was redeveloped as the ''"Parque Bicentenario"'' (Bicentenary Park). The new [[Mariscal Sucre International Airport]], 45 minutes from central Quito, opened to air traffic on 20 February 2013.

During 2003 and 2004, the bus lines of the Metrobus (Ecovia) were constructed, traversing the city from the north to the south.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Many avenues and roads were extended and enlarged, depressed passages were constructed, and roads were restructured geometrically to increase the flow of traffic. A [[Quito Metro|new subway system]] was opened with one line on 1 December 2023.

==Geography==
[[File:Quito, Ecuador Astronaut Image.jpg|thumb|250px|left|View of Quito from the [[International Space Station]] (north is at the left of the image). Quito sits on the eastern slopes of the [[Pichincha Volcano]], whose crater is visible.]]
Quito is located in the northern [[highland (geography)|highlands]] of [[Ecuador]] in the [[Guayllabamba River|Guayllabamba river]] basin. The city is built on a long plateau lying on the east flanks of the Pichincha volcano. The valley of Guayllabamba River where Quito lies is flanked by volcanoes, some of them snow-capped, and visible from the city on a clear day. Quito is the closest [[capital city]] to the [[equator]]. Quito's altitude is listed at {{cvt|2,820|m|sp=us}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecuadorexplorer.com/html/quito_overview.html |title=Quito Ecuador Travel Guide – Altitude, Hotels, Airport, Tours |work=ecuadorexplorer.com |date=10 January 2013 |access-date=22 November 2016}}</ref>

===Nearby volcanoes===
Quito's closest volcano is [[Pichincha Volcano|Pichincha]], looming over the western side of the city. Quito is the only capital city that was developed so close to an active volcano.<ref>{{cite web |author=Chris Beall |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/ecuador/travel-tips-and-articles/76129 |title=Ecuador's top 10 volcanic experiences – travel tips and articles |website=Lonely Planet |access-date=12 March 2013}}</ref> Pichincha volcano has several summits, among them Ruku Pichincha at {{cvt|4,700|m|sp=us}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] and Guagua Pichincha at {{cvt|4,794|m|sp=us}}.

Pichincha is active and being monitored by volcanologists at the Geophysical institute of the [[Escuela Politécnica Nacional|national polytechnic university]]. The largest eruption occurred in 1660 when more than {{cvt|25|cm|in|sp=us}} of ash covered the city.<ref name="nesdis">

Activity in other nearby volcanoes can also affect the city. In November 2002 the volcano [[Reventador]] erupted and showered the city in fine ash particles, to a depth of several centimeters.<ref>{{citation |contribution=Characteristics and impacts of recent ash falls produced by Tungurahua and El Reventador volcanoes, Ecuador |first=J-L. |last=Le Pennec |year=2006 |title=Fourth Conference, Cities on Volcanoes |url=http://www.igepn.edu.ec/PUBLICACIONES/2006/LePennec459.pdf |display-authors=etal |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030151545/http://www.igepn.edu.ec/PUBLICACIONES/2006/LePennec459.pdf |archive-date=30 October 2008}}</ref>

The volcanoes on the Central Cordillera (Royal Cordillera), east of Quito, surrounding the Guayllabamba valley, include [[Cotopaxi]], [[Sincholagua Volcano|Sincholagua]], [[Antisana]] and [[Cayambe (volcano)|Cayambe]]. Some of the volcanoes of the Western Cordillera, to the west of the Guayllabamba valley, include [[Illiniza]], [[Atacazo]], and [[Pululahua]] (which is the site of the [[Pululahua Geobotanical Reserve]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Geography |url=http://www.quito.com/v/geography/ |access-date=29 March 2013}}</ref>

===Climate===
The southern part of Quito has a [[subtropical highland climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), while the northern part has a [[warm-summer mediterranean climate]] (Köppen climate classification ''Csb''). Because of its altitude and location on the equator, Quito has a fairly constant cool climate. The average afternoon maximum temperature is {{cvt|21.4|C}}, and the average night-time minimum temperature is {{cvt|9.8|C}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Weather |publisher=Sitio Oficial Turístico de Quito |url=http://www.quito.com.ec/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=173&Itemid=340 |access-date=2 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719134200/http://www.quito.com.ec/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=173&Itemid=340 |archive-date=19 July 2011}}</ref> The annual average temperature is {{cvt|15.6|C}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Average weather for Quito |publisher=The Weather Channel |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/ECXX0008? |access-date=2 August 2008}}</ref> The city has only two seasons: dry and wet. The dry season, June through August (3 months), is referred to as summer; the [[wet season]], September through May (9 months), is referred to as winter. Annual precipitation, depending on location, is over {{cvt|1000|mm|in}}.

Due to its altitude, Quito receives some of the greatest solar radiation in the world, sometimes reaching a [[ultraviolet index|UV Index]] of 24 by solar noon under clear skies.<ref>{{cite web |title=Radiación UV nociva en Guayaquil y Quito |url=http://www.eluniverso.com/2008/10/23/0001/18/25F275D42FDE4AC9AE4AA40D9DC3CFE3.html |website=www.eluniverso.com |date=23 October 2008 |publisher=El gran Guayaquil |access-date=29 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Alertan sobre rayos UV en Quito |url=http://www.metroecuador.com.ec/1532-alertan-sobre-rayos-uv-en-quito.html |website=www.metroecuador.com |publisher=Metro Ecuador |access-date=29 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006162217/http://www.metroecuador.com.ec/1532-alertan-sobre-rayos-uv-en-quito.html |archive-date=6 October 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The fact that Quito lies almost on the equator means that high pressure systems are extremely rare. Pressure is stable, so very low pressure systems are also rare. From 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011 the lowest pressure recorded was {{cvt|998.2|hPa|inHg}}, and the highest was {{cvt|1015.2|hPa|inHg}}. Despite the absence of high pressure, Quito can still experience settled weather. Generally, the highest pressure is around midnight and the lowest in the mid-afternoon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wunderground.com/personal-weather-station/dashboard?ID=IPICHINC3#history/ |title=Yanahuaico Weather – Personal Weather Station: IPICHINC3 by Wunderground.com – Weather Underground |work=wunderground.com}}</ref>

==Topographical zones==
[[File:Vista de Quito desde El Panecillo, Ecuador, 2015-07-22, DD 39.JPG|thumb|250px|General view of the city from El Panecillo]]
Quito is divided into three areas, separated by hills:
#Central: houses the [[#Historic_center|colonial old city]].
#Southern: is mainly an industrial and working-class residential area.
#Northern: is the modern Quito, with high-rise buildings, shopping centers, the financial district, and a mix of upper-class, middle-class, and working-class residential areas.

==Economy==
[[File:FACHADA ASAMBLEA NACIONAL. QUITO, 20 DE FEBRERO 2020. 01.jpg|thumb|left|Modern buildings in Quito's growing Financial District]]
Quito is the largest city in contribution to national GDP, and the highest in per capita income. Quito has the highest level of tax collection in Ecuador, exceeding the national 57% per year 2009, currently being the most important economic region of the country{{citation needed|date = February 2014}}, as the latest "study" conducted by the Central Bank of Ecuador.

The top major industries in Quito includes textiles, metals and agriculture, with major crops for export being coffee, sugar, cacao, rice, bananas and palm oil.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.internations.org/quito-expats/guide/working-in-quito-18301 |title=Working in Quito |work=internations.org |access-date=22 November 2016 |archive-date=14 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114170007/https://www.internations.org/quito-expats/guide/working-in-quito-18301 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[Petroecuador]], the largest company in the country and one of the largest in Latin America is headquartered in Quito.<ref name="eppetroecuador.ec">{{cite web |title=Contacto |url=http://www.eppetroecuador.ec/?page_id=166 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207232944/https://www.eppetroecuador.ec/?page_id=166 |archive-date=7 February 2016 |access-date=4 February 2016 |publisher=Petroecuador |language=es}}</ref>{{verify source|date=March 2018}}

Headquarters and regional offices of many national and international financial institutions, oil corporations and international businesses are also located in Quito, making it a world class business city.

In "The World according to '''[[GaWC]]'''" global cities report, which measures a city's integration into the world city network, Quito is ranked as a Beta city: an important metropolis instrumental in linking its region or state into the world economy. [http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/gawcworlds.html]<ref>{{cite web |title=GaWC – The World According to GaWC |url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/gawcworlds.html |website=www.lboro.ac.uk |access-date=5 February 2016}}</ref>

==Politics==
===Governance===
{{Main|Mayor of Quito}}
[[File:Pabel Muñoz Lopez.jpg|thumb|[[Pabel Muñoz Lopez]], [[Mayor of Quito]].]]
Quito is governed by a mayor and a 15-member city council. The mayor is elected to a five-year term and can be re-elected. The position also doubles as Mayor of the [[Quito Canton|Metropolitan District of Quito]] (the canton). The current mayor is Pabel Muñoz Lopez.

===Urban parishes===
In Ecuador, cantons are subdivided into ''parishes'', so called because they were originally used by the Catholic Church, but with the secularization and liberalization of the Ecuadorian state, the political parishes were spun off the ones used by the church. Parishes are called ''urban'' if they are within the boundaries of the seat (capital) of their corresponding canton, and ''rural'' if outside those boundaries. Inside Quito (the city proper), subdivision into urban parishes depends on the organizations that use these parishes (e.g., the municipality, the electoral tribunals, the postal service, the Ecuadorian statistics institute). The urban parishes of different types are not necessarily coterminous nor the same in number or name.

{{As of|2008}}, the municipality of Quito divided the city into 32 urban parishes. These parishes, which are used by the municipality for administrative purposes, are also known as ''cabildos''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www4.quito.gob.ec/spirales/8_diccionario_de_la_base_de_datos/8_1_fondo_cartografico/8_1_1_1.html |title=Diccionario. Cabildo (Parroquias) |publisher=quito.gob.ec |access-date=8 July 2009}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> since 2001. Since the times of the Metropolitan District of Quito, parishes of this type are also grouped into larger divisions known as ''municipal zones'' (''zonas municipales''). These parishes are as follows:

The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quito]] divides the city into 167 parishes, which are grouped into 17 zones.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arquidiocesisdequito.org/Parroquias/parroquia.html |title=Parroquias de Quito |publisher=Arquidiocesisdequito.org |access-date=8 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308140350/http://arquidiocesisdequito.org/Parroquias/parroquia.html |archive-date=8 March 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
<!--
===Jewish Community===
The Jewish community of Ecuador, with domicile in Quito, has about 500 members. However, this number is decreasing because young people are emigrating to study in Israel or elsewhere abroad and not returning. There is a Jewish school in Quito, the Colegio Experimental Alberto Einstein, established in 1973, which serves both Jewish and non-Jewish students from kindergarten through the twelfth grade. All Jewish holidays are celebrated by the school, and Hebrew and other Jewish studies are taught there. The school has a fair reputation and pre-college preparatory program. The Jewish community of Quito has its own building, a home for the aged, and a synagogue that holds services on the Sabbath and holidays.-->

==Transport==
{{main|Transport in Quito}}

===Public transport===
The [[MetrobusQ]] network, also known as "Red Integrada de Transporte Público", is the [[bus rapid transit]] system running in Quito, and it goes through the city from south to north. It's divided into three sections—the green line ([[Quito trolleybus system|the central trolleybus]], known as ''El Trole''), the red line (the north-east [[Ecovía]]), and the blue line (the north-west Central Corridor). In addition to the [[bus rapid transit]] system, there are many bus companies running in the city. The buses have both a name and a number, and they have a fixed route. Taxi cabs are all yellow, and they have meters that show the fare. There are nearly 8,800 registered [[taxicab]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sistema Convencional de Transporte |publisher=Metrobús Quito |url=http://www.innovar-uio.com/innovar/images/stories/docs/basesmetro.pdf |access-date=4 August 2008 |language=es |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910165611/http://www.innovar-uio.com/innovar/images/stories/docs/basesmetro.pdf |archive-date=10 September 2008}}</ref>

In August 2012, the [[Municipality of Quito]] government established a municipal [[bicycle sharing system]] called Bici Q.<ref>{{cite web |title=BiciQ Bicicleta Pública |publisher=BiciQ |language=es |url=http://www.biciq.gob.ec/web/ |access-date=13 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918014850/http://www.biciq.gob.ec/web/ |archive-date=18 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Bici Q: 1.078 carnetizados |newspaper=La Hora – Nacional |location=Quito, Ecuador |language=es |publisher=La Hora |date=31 August 2012 |url=http://www.lahora.com.ec/index.php/noticias/show/1101385976#.UjNUTsaccrl |access-date=13 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=La bici pública rodará desde el martes |newspaper=El Comercio.com |location=Quito |language=es |publisher=Grupo El Comercio |date=27 July 2012 |url=http://www.elcomercio.com/quito/bici-publica-rodara-martes_0_743925688.html |access-date=13 September 2013 |archive-date=28 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728160027/http://www.elcomercio.com/quito/bici-publica-rodara-martes_0_743925688.html |url-status=dead}}</ref> 
In March 2023, a new bicycle sharing system was established in order to promote the bicycle as a sustainable, healthy and fast mean of transport. With this service, the objective is to reduce mobilization times, air pollution and improve the quality of life of the citizens.<ref>{{cite web |title=SBP Quito |url=https://www.sbpquito.com/ |language=es |access-date=20 October 2023}}</ref>

===Highways===
Although public transport is the primary form of travel in the city, including fleets of taxis that continually cruise the roadways, the use of private vehicles has increased substantially during the past decade.<ref>{{cite news |title=Cars are besieging Quito |newspaper=El Comercio |url=http://www.elcomercio.com/solo_texto.asp?id_noticia=80544 |access-date=4 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195428/http://www.elcomercio.com/solo_texto.asp?id_noticia=80544 |archive-date=27 September 2007 |language=es}}</ref>
Because of growing road congestion in many areas, there were plans to construct a [[light rail]] system, which were conceived to replace the northern portion of the ''Trole''.<ref>{{cite web |title=TRAQ – Tren Rápido de Quito |url=http://www.innovar-uio.com/traq/resumentraq.pdf |language=es |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228100617/http://www.innovar-uio.com/traq/resumentraq.pdf |archive-date=28 February 2007}}</ref> These plans have been ruled out and replaced by the construction of the [[Quito Metro|first metro line]] (subway) in 2012. It started to operate in December 2023, joining the existing public transportation network.<ref>{{cite web |title=El Metro entrará a operar entre marzo y abril del 2020 |url=https://www.elcomercio.com/actualidad/metro-operacion-cronograma-yunda-yanez.html |last=Carvajal |first=Ana |newspaper=[[El Comercio (Ecuador)|El Comercio]] |date=24 May 2019 |access-date=16 June 2019}}</ref>

===Roads, avenues and streets===
Because Quito is about {{cvt|40|km|mi}} long and {{cvt|5|km|mi}} at its widest, most of the important avenues of the city extend from north to south. The two main motorways that go from the northern part of the city to the southern are Avenue Oriental (Corridor Periférico Oriental) on the eastern hills that border the city, and Avenue Occidental on the western side of the city on the Pichincha volcano. The street 10 de Agosto also runs north to south through most of the city, running down the middle of it. The historic center of the city is based on a grid pattern, despite the hills, with the streets Venezuela, Chile, García Moreno, and Guayaquil being the most important.

===Aviation===
[[File:Acceso NAIQ.JPG|thumb|[[Mariscal Sucre International Airport]]]]
The [[Mariscal Sucre International Airport]] serves as the city's principal airport for passenger travel and freight. The airport is located {{cvt|18|km|mi|sp=us}} east of the city's center in the Tababela parish. It began operations on 20 February 2013, replacing the [[Old Mariscal Sucre International Airport]] located {{cvt|10|km|mi|sp=us}} north of the city center within city limits. The old airport was replaced due to tall buildings and nighttime fog that made landing from the south difficult. The old airport was converted into a metropolitan park.

===Railways===
There is a railroad that goes through the southern part of Quito and passes through the ''[[Estación de Chimbacalle]]''. It is managed by the [[Empresa de Ferrocarriles Ecuatorianos]] (EFE). This form of transportation is nowadays used mostly for tourism.

===Metro===
A {{cvt|23|km|mi|sp=us}} metro subway system ([[Quito Metro]]) began construction with Phase One begun in 2013, entailed the construction of stations at La Magdalena and El Labrador. Phase Two, begun in 2016, involves 15 stations, a depot and sub-systems. The project is expected to carry 400,000 passengers per day and to cost $1.5 billion<ref name="news1">{{cite web |last=Osava |first=Mario |title=Subway Will Modernise – and Further Gentrify – Historic Centre of Quito |publisher=[[Inter Press Service]] |date=30 November 2016 |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2016/11/subway-will-modernise-and-further-gentrify-historical-centre-of-quito/ |access-date=21 December 2016}}</ref> with financing coming from the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF)<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.globalrailnews.com/2013/08/04/world-bank-backs-metro-quito-construction/ |title=World bank backs Metro Quito construction |date=4 August 2013 |journal=GlobalRailNews}}</ref> and the line opened on Dic 1, 2023.<ref name="news2">{{cite web |last=Salazar |first=Paul |title=The Economic Recovery of Quito Takes the Subway |work=Working for a World Free of Poverty |publisher=[[World Bank]] |date=5 December 2016 |url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2016/12/05/ecuador-la-reactivacion-economica-de-quito-viaja-en-metro |access-date=21 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.elcomercio.com/actualidad/quito/operacion-metro-quito-junio-rodrigo-torres.html |title=Operación del Metro de Quito ahora se prevé para junio del 2022 |newspaper=[[El Comercio (Ecuador)|El Comercio]] |date=30 June 2021 |access-date=6 July 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Artymiuk |first=Simon |date=5 May 2023 |title=Revenue services begin on Quito Metro Line 1 |url=https://www.railjournal.com/passenger/metros/revenue-services-begin-on-quito-metro-line-1/ |work=IRJ |access-date=11 May 2023}}</ref>

===Historic center===
[[File:Iglesia de San Francisco, Quito, Ecuador, 2015-07-22, DD 217-219 HDR.JPG|thumb|left|250px|The large [[Basilica and Convent of San Francisco, Quito|Basilica of San Francisco]], built between 1535 and 1650.]]
Quito has the largest, least-altered, and best-preserved historic center in [[the Americas]].<ref name="unesco"/> This center was, together with the historic center of [[Kraków]], Poland, the first to be declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] on 18 September 1978. The historic center of Quito is to the south of the capital's current center, on an area of {{cvt|320|ha}}, and one of the most important historic areas in Latin America. There are about 130 monumental buildings (which host a variety of pictorial art and sculpture, mostly religiously inspired, in a multi-faceted range of schools and styles), and 5,000 properties registered in the municipal inventory of heritage properties.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

;Palacio de Carondelet
[[Palacio de Carondelet]] ({{langx|es|link=no|Palacio de Carondelet}}) is the seat of the Government of the Republic of [[Ecuador]], located in the historic center of Quito. The palace overlooks the bustling public space known as Independence Square or [[Plaza Grande]] (colonial name), together with the Archbishop's Palace, the Municipal Palace, the [[Hotel Plaza Grande]] and the Metropolitan Cathedral. During the Republican era almost all the presidents (constitutional, internees and dictators) have governed from the Carondelet Palace. The presidential residence is located on the third level of the Palace, along with administrative offices.

;Basílica del Voto Nacional
The monumental [[Basilica del Voto Nacional]] is the most important neo-Gothic building in Ecuador, and one of the most representative of the American continent. It was once the largest in the New World.

;Quito Metropolitan Cathedral
The [[Quito Metropolitan Cathedral]], is one of the largest religious symbols of spiritual value for the Catholic community in the city. Construction of this church began in 1535, seventeen years after the Diocese of Quito was created in 1545. The church building was completed in 1799, during the administration of President of the Real Audiencia, Baron Héctor de Carondelet.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

One of the major events that took place in this cathedral was the murder of the Bishop of Quito, José Ignacio Checa y Barba, who during the mass of [[Good Friday]] on 30 March 1877, was poisoned by strychnine dissolved in the consecrated wine. The cathedral is also the burial place of the remains of the [[Grand Marshal]] [[Antonio José de Sucre]] and also of several presidents of the Republic, as well as of bishops and priests who died in the diocese. The cathedral is on the south side of the [[Plaza de La Independencia]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

;Church of La Compañía de Jesús
Construction of The [[Church of the Society of Jesus (Quito, Ecuador)|Church of La Compañía]] began in 1605. Building took 160 years. In 1765 the work was completed with the construction of the façade. This was done by Native Americans who carefully shaped the stones to build the façade in the ornate [[Spanish Baroque architecture|Baroque style]], in what is one of the finest examples of this art in the Americas.

;Basilica of San Francisco
The [[Basilica and Convent of San Francisco, Quito|Basilica of San Francisco]] is the largest of the existing architectural ensembles in the historic centers of cities in Latin America. The construction of the church began in 1550, on land adjacent to the plaza where the Native Americans engaged in the barter of products.

;Church of El Sagrario
In colonial times, the [[La Iglesia de El Sagrario (Quito)|Church of El Sagrario]] was one of the largest architectural marvels of Quito. The construction is of the Italian Renaissance style and it was built in the late 17th century. It has a screen that supports its sculptures and decorations. This structure was built by Bernardo de Legarda. Its central arch leads to a dome decorated with frescoes of biblical scenes featuring archangels. It was done by Francisco Albán. The altarpiece was gilded by Legarda. It is located on Calle García Moreno, near the cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

;Church of Santo Domingo
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}
[[Church of Santo Domingo, Quito|Church of Santo Domingo]]. Although they arrived in Quito in 1541, the Dominicans started to build their own temple in 1580, using the plans of Francisco Becerra, and under his direction. The work was completed in the first half of the 17th century. Inside the church are valuable structures, such as the neo-Gothic main altar. This was installed in the late 19th century by Italian Dominicans. The roof of the Mudéjar style church features paintings of martyrs of the Order of Saint Dominic. The roof of the nave is supported by a pair-and-knuckle frame, decorated inside by tracery. In the museum on the north side of the lower cloister, there are wonderful pieces by great Quito sculptors such as the [[Saint Dominic|Saint Dominic de Guzmán]] by Father Carlos, the [[John of God|Saint John of God]] by Caspicara, and the [[Thomas Aquinas|Saint Thomas Aquinas]] by Legarda. Another Baroque masterpiece that still stands today, is the Chapel of Nuestra Señora del Rosario, a recognizable architectural icon of Quito. This chapel was built next to the church. The largest fraternity in the city of Quito was founded in this chapel.
