'''Kananga''', formerly known as '''Luluabourg''' or '''Luluaburg''', is the capital [[Cities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|city]] of the [[Kasai-Central|Kasai-Central Province]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and was the capital of the former [[Kasaï-Occidental |Kasaï-Occidental Province]]. It is the fourth most populous urban area in the country, with an estimated population of 1,524,000 in 2021.<ref name=pop/>

The city lies near the Lulua River, a tributary of the [[Kasai River]] and the [[Ilebo]]-[[Lubumbashi]] [[Congo Railway|railway]].  An important [[commerce|commercial]] and [[administrative centre]], it is home to a [[museum]] and to [[Kananga Airport]].

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}
[[Germany|German]] explorer [[Hermann Wissmann]] established a station in the area around present-day Kananga, on the left bank of the Lulua. Wissmann named the station Malandji, a name suggested by his 400 carriers, who were from the city of [[Malanje]] in Angola. Later on, with the construction of the railway on the other bank of the river, the station was moved, and the Lulua train station gave its name to the new town, namely Luluabourg. The old location is named Malandji-Makulu (old Malandji) to this day.

At the [[Belgo-Congolese Round Table Conference]], in 1960, the name given to the negotiations for the independence of the then-[[Belgian Congo]], a decision was taken that the new state would move the location of its capital from [[Kinshasa]] to Luluabourg, due to the latter's central location. However, due to multiple political setbacks, and particularly the secession attempt by [[Albert Kalonji]] and his [[South Kasai]], this decision was never implemented. When the central government reconquered South Kasai in 1962, Luluabourg became the capital of the new [[Kasai-Occidental]] province. Kananga (as Luluabourg) was the site of the drafting of the first Congolese-written constitution for the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], in 1964.

[[File:Avenue a Kananga, Congo.jpg|thumb|left|Street view of Kananga]]
In 1966, during an [[Authenticité (Zaire)|Africanization]] campaign, [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] renamed a number of cities and towns that bore European names. Leopoldville became [[Kinshasa]], and Luluabourg became Kananga. The name Kananga derives from the Tshiluba word kanangayi meaning "a place for peace or love" as what is now central Kananga was a gathering place for pre-colonial chiefs to discuss treaties and to settle disputes.

Under the 2006 constitution, the Democratic republic of the Congo was divided in 25 provinces, and one national Capital city ([[Kinshasa]]). The [[Kasai-Occidental]] was divided into two provinces. Kananga became the capital of the [[Lulua Province (proposed)|Lulua Province]].

Locally, Kananga is known as Kananga-Malandji, or even Kananga-Malandji wa Nshinga. Nshinga, or cables, stands for the large high-voltage cables of the [[Inga-Shaba]] project, that cross the skies of Kananga, and that link [[Kolwezi]] and the [[Lualaba Province]] to the [[Inga Dam]] in [[Bas-Congo]].

The city came into headlines within the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] community in 2018, especially in [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greece]], when a documentary film called "[[Kananga (documentary)|Kananga]]" was produced, talking about the minority Orthodox Christian population in the city, and the Cathedral of Saint Andrew, which is the largest Eastern Orthodox church in Africa.<ref>{{Citation |last=Tripodakis |first=Pavlos |title=Kananga |date=2018-03-29 |type=Documentary |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8696876/ |access-date=2024-01-22 |archive-date=2023-11-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231119233024/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8696876/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |title=KANANGA Documentary 2018 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyQ5q0muTQ |access-date=2024-01-22 |language=en |archive-date=2024-01-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240123204121/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyQ5q0muTQ |url-status=live }}</ref>
