It has important road and rail transport infrastructures, and hosts the main airport in Sicily (fifth-largest in Italy). The city is located on Sicily's east coast, facing the [[Ionian Sea]] at the base of the active volcano [[Mount Etna]].  It is the capital of the 58-municipality region known as the [[Metropolitan City of Catania]], which is the seventh-largest metropolitan area in Italy. The population of the city proper is 311,584,<ref name=istat/> while the population of the [[Metropolitan City of Catania]] is 1,107,702.<ref name=istat/>

Catania was founded in the 8th century BC by Chalcidian Greeks in [[Magna Graecia]].<ref name="travelplan.it">{{cite web|url=http://www.travelplan.it/catania_guide_history_culture.htm |title=Catania history – Catania culture – Catania – attractions in Catania – art Catania – history guide Catania – Italy Katane |publisher=Travelplan.it |access-date=1 June 2010}}</ref> The city has weathered multiple geologic catastrophes: it was almost completely destroyed by a catastrophic earthquake in [[1169 Sicily earthquake|1169]].<ref name="travelplan.it"/> A major eruption and lava flow from nearby [[Mount Etna]] nearly swamped the city in [[1669 eruption of Mount Etna|1669]] and it suffered severe devastation from the [[1693 Sicily earthquake]].<ref name="travelplan.it"/>

During the 14th century, and into the [[Renaissance]] period, Catania was one of Italy's most important cultural, artistic and political centres.<ref name="travelplan.it"/> It was the site of Sicily's first [[University of Catania|university]], founded in 1434.<ref name="travelplan.it"/> It has been the native or adopted home of some of Italy's most famous artists and writers, including the composers [[Vincenzo Bellini]] and [[Giovanni Pacini]], and the writers [[Giovanni Verga]], [[Luigi Capuana]], [[Federico De Roberto]] and [[Nino Martoglio]].

Catania today is the industrial, logistical, and commercial centre of Sicily. Its airport, the [[Catania–Fontanarossa Airport]], is the largest in Southern Italy. The central "old town" of Catania features exuberant late-[[baroque architecture]], prompted after the 1693 earthquake, and is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

==Etymology==
The ancient [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous population]] of Sicily, the [[Sicels]], named their villages after geographical attributes of their location. The {{not a typo|[[Siculian]]}} word ''katane'' means "grater, flaying knife, skinning place" or a "crude tool apt to pare". Other translations of the name are "harsh lands", "uneven ground", "sharp stones", or "rugged or rough soil". The latter etymologies are easily justifiable since, for many centuries following an eruption, the city has always been rebuilt within its black-lava landscape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sicilia.indettaglio.it/eng/comuni/ct/catania/catania.html |title=The meaning of the name Catania |publisher=Sicilia.indettaglio.it |date=4 November 2006 |access-date=5 April 2011}}</ref>

Around 263 BC, the city was variously known as ''Catĭna'' ({{IPA|la|ˈkatɪna|lang}}) and ''Catăna'' ({{IPA|la|ˈkatana|lang}}; {{langx|grc|Κατάνη}} {{IPA-el|katánɛː|}}).{{efn|Roman writers fluctuate between the two forms Catana and Catina, of which the latter is, perhaps, the most common, and is supported by inscriptions (Orell. 3708, 3778); but the analogy of the Greek {{lang|grc|Κατάνη}}, and the modern Catania, would point to the former as the more correct.}} The former has been primarily used for its supposed assonance with ''catina'', the Latin feminization of the name ''catinus''.<ref>Holm Adolf (1925), ''Catania Antica'', G. Libertini</ref> ''Catinus'' has two meanings: "a gulf, a basin or a bay" and "a bowl, a vessel or a trough", thanks to the city's distinctive topography.

Around 900, when Catania was part of the [[emirate of Sicily]], it was known in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as ''Balad al-fīl'' ({{lang|ar|بلد الفيل}}) and ''Madīnat al-fīl'' ({{lang|ar|مدينة الفيل}}), respectively meaning "the Village (or Country) of the Elephant" and "the City of the Elephant".<ref>{{cite book|last=Amari|first=Michele|title=Edrisi, Il Libro di Re Ruggero|language=it|volume=I|page=71}}</ref> The Elephant likely referred to the ancient lava sculpture, now placed over the fountain in Piazza Duomo. The sculpture is most likely a prehistoric sculpture that was reforged during the Byzantine Era, prized as a protective talisman against enemies, both human, natural or geologic. Another Arab toponym was ''Qaṭāniyyah'' ({{lang|ar|قطانية}}), allegedly from the Arabic word for the "[[Legume|leguminous plants]]".<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite book|year=1987|title=Enciclopedia di Catania|language=it|publisher=Tringale}}</ref> Pulses like [[lentil]]s, beans, peas, [[Vicia faba|broad beans]], and [[lupin]]s were chiefly cultivated in the plains around the city well before the arrival of [[Aghlabid]]s. Afterwards, many Arabic agronomists developed these crops and the [[citrus]] orchards in the area around the city. The toponym ''Wādī Mūsá'' ({{lang|ar|وادي موسى}}), or "the Valley of Moses" (from the Arabic name of the [[Simeto]] River), was rarely used.<ref name="autogenerated1"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Correnti|first=Santi|year=1981|title=La Città Semprerifiorente|language=it|location=Catania|publisher=Greco}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Correnti|first1=Santi|last2=Spartà|first2=Santino|year=2007|title=Le Strade di Catania|language=it|location=Rome|publisher=Newton Compton}}</ref>

==Geography==
As observed by [[Strabo]], the location of Catania at the foot of [[Mount Etna]] has been both a curse and a blessing. On the one hand, violent outbursts of the volcano throughout history have destroyed large parts of the city, while on the other hand the volcanic ashes yield fertile soil, especially suited for the growth of vines. (Strab. vi. p.&nbsp;269)

Two [[subterranean river]]s run under the city; the Amenano, which surfaces at one single point south of Piazza Duomo, and the Longane (or Lognina).<ref>Giuffrida Tino, ''Catania dalle origini alla dominazione normanna'', Catania, Bonaccorso. Excerpt here {{in lang|it}} [http://www.cataniaperte.com/cronologia/saggi/topografia_antica.pdf]</ref>

===Climate===
Catania experiences a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa'').<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=6461&cityname=Catania%2C+Sicilia%2C+Italy&units= Climate Summary from Weatherbase.com (Catania, Italy)]</ref> The city has hot summers, one of the hottest in the whole country of Italy. Temperatures of {{convert|40|°C|0}} are surpassed almost every year a couple of times.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Winters are mild, with significant nighttime cooling. Precipitation is concentrated from October to March, leaving late spring and summer virtually dry. The city receives around {{convert|500|mm|abbr=off}} of rain per year, although the amount can vary greatly from year to year, from  over {{convert|1,200|mm|abbr=on}} to under {{convert|250|mm|abbr=on}}.

During winter nights, lows can occasionally reach below freezing. Highs under {{convert|10|°C|0}} may happen during winter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ilmeteo.it/portale/archivio-meteo/Catania|title = Che tempo faceva a Catania - Archivio Meteo Catania » ILMETEO.it}}</ref> Snow, due to the presence of [[Mount Etna|Etna]] that protects the city from the northern winds, is an uncommon occurrence, but occasional snow flurries have been seen over the recent years, especially in the hilly districts. More recently, light snowfalls occurred on 9 February 2015, 6 January 2017 and 5 January 2019, but the last heavy snowfall dates back to 17 December 1988.

== Demographics ==
[[File:Cataniavistaarea.jpg|thumb|upright|An aerial view of the port of Catania]]
In January 2015, there were 315,601 people residing in Catania,<ref name=istat/> of whom 47.2% were male and 52.8% were female. Minors (people under age 18) totalled 20.50 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 18.87 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners).{{Historical populations|1861|70608|1871|83680|1881|101135|1901|147700|1911|207848|1921|252840|1931|225169|1936|244972|1951|299629|1961|363928|1971|400048|1981|380328|1991|333075|2001|313110|2011|293902|2021|301104|type=|footnote=Source: [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]]}}The average age of Catania residents is 41 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Catania declined by 3.35 percent, while [[Italy]] as a whole grew by 3.85 percent.<ref name=istat/> The reason for this [[population decline]] in the ''comune'' di Catania is mainly due to a large segment of the population leaving the city centre to go to live in the uptown residential areas of the ''comuni'' of the Metropolitan area. As a result of this, while the population in the ''comune'' di Catania declines, the population of the hinterland ''comuni'' increases making the overall population of the Metropolitan area increase.<ref name=istat/>

The current [[birth rate]] of Catania is 10.07 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births. {{As of|2006}}, 98.03% of the population was [[Italian people|Italian]]. The largest immigrant groups come from [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]: 0.69%, [[South Asia]]: 0.46%, and from other [[Europe]]an countries (particularly from [[Ukraine]] and [[Poland]]): 0.33%. There is currently a small community of Samaritans from Israel.

==History==
{{For timeline}}

===Foundation===
Around 729 BC, the ancient village of ''Katane'' was occupied by [[Chalcis|Chalcidian]] Greek settlers from nearby [[Naxos (Sicily)|Naxos]] along the coast. It became the Chalcidian colony of ''Katánē'' under a leader named Euarchos (Euarchus) and the native population was rapidly [[Hellenization|Hellenised]].

[[Thucydides]] states that it came into existence slightly later than Leontini (modern [[Lentini]]), which he claims was five years after [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], or 730 BC.<ref>Thuc. vi. 3; [[Strabo]] vi. p. 268; [[Scymnus]] 286; [[Scylax]] § 13; [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] ''s. v.''</ref>

The settlement's acropolis was on the hill of Monte Vergine, a defensible hill immediately west of the current city centre. The port of Catania appears to have been much frequented in ancient time and was the chief place of export for the corn of the rich neighbouring plains.

===Greek Catania===
{{Further|topic=the 340 AD.|Massacre of Catania}}
Catania was associated with the ancient legend of Amphinomos and Anapias, who, on occasion of a great eruption of Etna, abandoned all their property and carried off their aged parents on their shoulders. The stream of lava itself was said to have parted, and flowed aside so as not to harm them. Statues were erected to their honour, and the place of their burial was known as the ''Campus Piorum''; the Catanaeans even introduced the figures of the youths on their coins, and the legend became a favorite subject of allusion and declamation among the [[List of Latin language poets|Latin poets]], of whom the younger [[Lucilius]] and [[Claudian]] have dwelt upon it at considerable length.<ref>Strabo vi. p. 269</ref><ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] x. 28. § 4</ref><ref>Conon, ''Narr''. 43</ref><ref>Philostr. ''Vit. Apoll.'' v. 17</ref><ref>[[Gaius Julius Solinus]] 5. § 15</ref><ref>Gaius Julius Hyginus 25</ref><ref>[[Valerius Maximus]] v. 4. Ext. § 4</ref><ref>Lucil. ''Aetn''. 602-40</ref><ref>Claudian. ''Idyll''. 7</ref><ref>[[Silius Italicus]] xiv. 196</ref><ref>Auson. ''Ordo Nob. Urb.'' 11.</ref>

The Greek polis of Catania appears to have been a local center of learning. The philosopher and legislator [[Charondas]] (late 6th c. BC), born in Catania, putatively wrote program of laws used here and in other Chalcidic cities, both in Sicily and through [[Magna Graecia]].<ref>[[Aristotle]], ''Pol''. ii. 9.</ref> suggesting a link between Catania and other cities during this time. The poets [[Ibycus]] and [[Stesichorus]] ({{circa|630}}–555 BC) lived in Catania. The latter putatively was buried in a magnificent sepulchre outside one of the gates, therefore named ''Porta Stesichoreia''. [[Xenophanes]] ({{circa|570}}-475 BC), one of the founders of the [[Velia (town)|Eleatic]] school of philosophy, also spent the latter years of his life in the city.<ref>Diog. Laert. ix. 2. § 1.</ref> The first introduction of dancing to accompany the flute was also ascribed to [[Andron of Catania|Andron]], a citizen of Catania.<ref>Athen. i. p.&nbsp;22, c.</ref>

Catania appears to have remained independent until the conquest by the despot [[Hiero I of Syracuse|Hieron of Syracuse]]; in 476 BC, he expelled all the original inhabitants of Catania and replaced them with his subjects from the town of Leontini – said to have numbered no less than 10,000, consisting partly of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracusans]] and [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesians]]. Hieron changed the city's name to '''{{lang|grc|Αἴτνη}}''' (''Aítnē'', Aetna or Ætna, after the nearby [[Mount Etna]], and proclaimed himself the [[Oekist]] or founder of the new city. For this he was celebrated by [[Pindar]], and after his death he received heroic honours from the citizens of his new colony.<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] xi. 49, in 66; Strabo l.c.; Pind. ''Pyth''. i., and Schol. ''ad loc.''</ref>

A few years after the death of Hieron and the expulsion of [[Thrasybulus of Syracuse]], the Syracusans combined with [[Ducetius]], king of the [[Sicels]], to expel the newly settled inhabitants of Catania, who went on to settle in the fortress of [[Aetna (city)|Inessa]] (to which they gave the name Aetna). The old Chalcidic citizens returned to the city in 461 BC.<ref>Diod. xi. 76; Strabo ''l. c.'')</ref>

The period that followed appears to have been one of great prosperity for Catania, as well as for the Sicilian cities in general.

In 415 BC, Catania became involved with the [[Sicilian Expedition|expedition to Sicily]] pursued by the [[Classical Athens|Athenians]] to punish Syracuse. Initially the Catanaeans refused to allow the Athenians into their city, but after the latter had forced an entrance, the Athenian leader [[Alcibiades]] made a famous speech in front of the assembly. Catania became an ally, and the headquarters of the Athenian army for the first year of the expedition, and a base of their subsequent operations against Syracuse.<ref>Thuc. vi. 50–52, 63, 71, 89; Diod. xiii. 4, 6, 7; [[Plutarch|Plut.]] ''Nic''. 15, 16.</ref> After the defeat of the Athenians, Catania was again threatened by Syracuse. In 403 BC, [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]] plundered the city, sold its citizens as slaves, and repopulated the town with [[Campania]]n mercenaries. However, the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] would take possession of Catania under [[Himilco (general)|Himilco]] and [[Mago (fleet commander)|Mago]], after the nearby great naval [[Battle of Catana (397 BC)]] where they defeated [[Leptines of Syracuse]], and in 396 BC forcing the local Campanian mercenaries to relocate to [[Aetna (city)|Aetna]].<ref>Diod. xiv. 15, 58, 60.</ref>

[[Calippus of Syracuse|Calippus]], the assassin of [[Dion of Syracuse]], held Catania for a time (Plut. ''Dion.'' 58); and when [[Timoleon]] landed in Sicily in 344 BC Catania was subject to the despot [[Mamercus of Catane|Mamercus]] who at first joined the [[Ancient Corinth|Corinthian]] leader, but afterwards abandoned this allegiance for that of the Carthaginians. As a consequence he was attacked and expelled by Timoleon in 338 BC.<ref>Diod. xvi. 69; Plut. ''Timol''. 13, 30–34.</ref>

Catania was now restored to a fragile independence; changing sides during the wars starting in 311 BC of [[Agathocles of Syracuse]] with the Carthaginians. When [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] landed in Sicily in 278 BC, Catania was the first to open its gates to him, and welcomed him with great splendor.<ref>Diod. xix. 110, xxii. 8, Exc. Hoesch. p. 496.</ref>

===Roman rule===
[[File:Acquedotto romano Valcorrente2.jpg|thumb|250px|Roman Aqueduct at Valcorrente]]

During the [[First Punic War]], Catania was one of the first cities of Sicily to submit to the [[Roman Republic]] after their first successes in 263 BC when it was taken by [[Manius Valerius Maximus Corvinus Messalla|Valerius Messalla]].<ref>Eutrop. ii. 19.</ref><ref>Pliny the Elder , Naturalis historia, vii. 60</ref> A sundial was part of the booty which was placed in the [[Comitium]] in Rome.<ref>Pliny the Elder, Naturalis historia, VII 214</ref> Since then the city became a ''civitas decumana'' i.e. was subject to the payment of a tenth of its agricultural income as a tax to Rome. The conqueror of Syracuse, [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]], built a gymnasium here.<ref>Plutarch, Life of Marcellus, 30</ref>

It appears to have continued afterwards to maintain its friendly relations with Rome and though it did not enjoy the advantages of a confederate city (''foederata civitas''), like its neighbours Tauromenium (modern [[Taormina]]) and Messana (modern [[Messina]]), it rose to a position of great prosperity under the Roman rule.

Around 135 BC during the [[First Servile War]], it was conquered by rebel slaves.<ref>Strabo, VI 2, 6</ref>

One of the most serious [[Volcanic eruption|eruptions]] of [[Mount Etna]] happened in 121 BC, when a great part of Catania was overwhelmed by streams of lava, and the hot ashes fell in such quantities in the city itself, as to break in the roofs of the houses. Catana was in consequence exempted, for 10 years, from its usual contributions to the Roman state.<ref>Oros. v. 13.</ref> The greater part of the broad tract of plain to the southwest of Catana (now called the ''Piana di Catania'', a district of great fertility), appears to have belonged, in [[Ancient history|ancient times]], to Leontini or Centuripa (modern [[Centuripe]]), but that portion of it between Catana itself and the mouth of the Symaethus was annexed to Catana and must have furnished abundant supplies of grain.

[[Cicero]] repeatedly mentions it as, in his time, a wealthy and flourishing city; it retained its ancient municipal institutions, its [[chief magistrate]] bearing the title of ''Proagorus''; and appears to have been one of the principal ports of Sicily for the export of corn.<ref>Cicero ''[[In Verrem]]'' iii. 4. 3, 83, iv. 23, 45; [[Livy]] xxvii. 8.</ref>

In the [[War between Sextus Pompey and the Second Triumvirate|Sicilian revolt]] from 44 BC [[Sextus Pompeius]] selected Sicily as his base and Catania gave in to Sextus' revolt and joined his forces. Sextus amassed a formidable army and a large fleet of warships at his base at [[Messana]], with many slaves joining from the villas of patricians. After the victory of Augustus in 36 BC much of the vast farmland in Sicily was either ruined or left empty, and much of this land was taken and distributed to members of the legions which had fought there. Catania suffered severely from the ravages but was afterwards one of the cities raised to the status of [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] by Augustus which restored its prosperity through the settlement of veterans, so that in [[Strabo]]'s time it was one of the few cities in the island that was flourishing.<ref>Strabo vi. pp. 268, 270, 272; [[Dion Cassius]] iv. 7.</ref>

Another revolt led by the gladiator Selurus in 35 BC created mayhem for a while.<ref>Strabo 6.2.6</ref>

The Roman aqueduct of Catania was the longest in Roman Sicily at {{Convert|24|km|mi}}, starting from the springs of Santa Maria di Licodia.

It retained its colonial rank, as well as its prosperity, throughout the period of the [[Roman Empire]]; so that in the 4th century [[Ausonius]] in his ''[[Ordo urbium nobilium|Ordo Nobilium Urbium]]'', notices Catania and Syracuse alone among the cities of Sicily.<ref>Pliny iii. 8. s. 14; Ptol. iii. 4. § 9; Itin. Ant. pp. 87,90, 93, 94.</ref>

===Middle Ages===
[[File:OldCatania.png|thumb|right|Picture of Catania in 1575]]
Catania was sacked by the [[Vandals]] of [[Gaiseric]] in 440–441. After a period under the [[Ostrogoths]], it was reconquered in 535 by the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], under which (aside from a short period in 550–555) it remained until the 9th century. It was the seat of the Byzantine governor of the island.

Catania was under an [[Emirate of Sicily|Islamic emirate]] for two centuries, after which it fell to the [[Italo-Normans|Normans]] of [[Roger I of Sicily]]. Subsequently, the city was ruled by a bishop-count (1072). In 1194–1197 the city was sacked by German soldiers during after the conquest of the island by emperor [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]]. In 1232 it rebelled to the former's son, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], who later built a massive castle, ''[[Castello Ursino]]'' and also made Catania a royal city, ending the dominance of the bishops.

Catania was one of the main centers of the [[Sicilian Vespers]] revolt (1282) against the [[Capetian House of Anjou|House of Anjou]] and was the seat of the coronation of the new Aragonese king of Sicily, [[Peter I of Sicily|Peter I]]. The city remained a key Sicilian port during the [[War of the Sicilian Vespers]]. After a civil revolt in 1299, the city was captured by an Angevin army, which [[Angevin invasion of Sicily|occupied the city]] until the Angevins evacuated their holdings on Sicily in 1302.<ref>Stanton, Charles D. “LAURIA’S LAST GREAT CAMPAIGN (SUMMER 1299–SPRING 1300).” In ''Roger of Lauria (c.1250-1305): “Admiral of Admirals,”'' NED-New edition., 271–88. Boydell & Brewer, 2019. {{doi|10.2307/j.ctvd58tqg.23}}.</ref>

In the 14th century it gained importance as it was chosen by the Aragonese as a Parliament and Royal seat. Here, in 1347, it was signed the treaty of peace that ended the long [[War of the Vesper]] between Aragonese and Angevines. Catania lost its capital role when, in the early 15th century, Sicily was turned into a member of the [[Crown of Aragon]], and kept its autonomy and original privileges specially during the period from 1282 to 1410.

In 1434 King [[Alfonso V of Aragon|Alfonso V]] founded here [[University of Catania|the ''Siciliae Studium Generale'']], the oldest university in the island.

===Early modern times===

[[File:Etna eruzione 1669 platania.jpg|thumb|right|Mount Etna erupting in 1669]]
With the unification of Castile and Aragon (early 16th century<ref>[[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] became [[King of Naples]] as Ferdinand III, reuniting Naples with Sicily permanently and for the first time since 1458.</ref>), Sicily became part of the Spanish Empire. It rebelled against the foreign government in 1516 and 1647.<ref>[http://freaknet.org/martin/libri/Longo/revolution.html Translation of an eye-witness account of the 1647 rebellion]</ref>

In 1669 the city's surroundings suffered great material damage from the [[1669 Etna eruption]]. The city itself was largely saved by its walls that diverted most of the lava into the port. Afterwards, in 1693 the city was nearly completely destroyed by a heavy [[1693 Sicily earthquake]] and its aftershocks. The city was then rebuilt in the [[Baroque architecture]] that nowadays characterizes it.

===Unified Italy===
Catania was one of the vanguards of the movement for Sicilian autonomy in the early 19th century.

In 1860 [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]'s [[expedition of the Thousand]] conquered [[Sicily]] for Piedmont from the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Since the following year Catania was part of the newly [[unification of Italy|unified Italy]], whose history it shares since then.

The first half of the twentieth century was a cycle of repeated destruction and rebuilding for the city of Catania.

During the years 1923 and 1928, Catania endured two major eruptions of Mt. Etna. The 1923 eruption lasted twenty-nine days, from June 6 until June 29. A large lava flow occurred in the 1928 event and was the first to destroy a population center in over two hundred years.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ponte |first=Gaetano |title=The Recent Eruption of Etna |publisher=Nature |year=1923 |edition=112 |pages=546–548}}</ref>

At the onset of World War 1, Italy was part of a defensive alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary referred to as the Triple Alliance.  After one year, Italy joined the Allied forces. Many promises made to secure Italy’s help during the war were not kept resulting in stability issues throughout the country leading to the adoption of fascist ideations.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Pryce |first=Roy |title=Italy and the Outbreak of the First World War |publisher=Cambridge Historical Journal |year=1954 |pages=219–227}}</ref> As the second World War began, the new regime opted to support Adolf Hitler, resulting in Catania and all the surrounding areas on Sicily being destroyed by Allied bombing.

{{anchor|Allied air attacks}} During [[World War II]], Catania was heavily bombed by the Allied air forces, owing to the presence of two of the main Axis airfields in Sicily ([[Gerbini Airfield|Gerbini]] and [[Catania-Fontanarossa Airport|Fontanarossa]]) and for its strategically important port and [[marshalling yard]]. Altogether, the city suffered eighty-seven air raids. The heaviest took place in the spring and summer of 1943, before and during the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]; they caused heavy damage to the city (among others, twenty-eight churches and most historic palaces suffered damage), killed 750 inhabitants and prompted most of the population to flee to the countryside.<ref>[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/catania_res-6c14df7d-87e5-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_%28Enciclopedia-Italiana%29/ Enciclopedia Treccani]</ref><ref>[http://bombesullitalia.blogspot.com/2019/04/bombardamenti-di-catania.html Bombardamenti di Catania]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140202213215/http://rcslibri.corriere.it/bombardatelitalia/bombardate1943.pdf Bombardate l'Italia: 1943]</ref><ref>[http://anpi-lissone.over-blog.com/article-i-bombardamenti-aerei-nel-mezzogiorno-d-italia-60089978.html I bombardamenti aerei nel Mezzogiorno d'Italia]</ref> After heavy fighting across eastern Sicily, Catania was eventually captured by the [[British 8th Army]] on 5 August 1943.<ref>The Invasion of Sicily 1943 By Jon Diamond, pp. 212–214</ref>

After the conflict, and the constitution of the [[Italy|Italian Republic]] (1946), Catania attempted to catch up with the economic and social development of Italy's richer northern regions. The problems faced in Catania were emblematic of those faced by other towns in the [[Southern Italy|Mezzogiorno]], namely a heavy gap in industrial development and infrastructures, and the threat of [[Sicilian Mafia|the mafia]]. This notwithstanding, during the 1960s (and partly during the 1990s) Catania enjoyed development and a period of economic, social, and cultural success. In the first decade of the 21st century, Catania's economic and social development somewhat faltered and the city is again facing economic and social stagnation. This was aggravated by the economic crisis left by the {{Lang|it|[[Forza Italia]]|italic=no}} administration of mayor Scapagnini in 2008.<ref>[http://www.rai.tv/dl/RaiTV/programmi/media/ContentItem-6b76e15d-a80b-465e-9531-131a194e030b.html?p=0 Documentary about the conditions of the city after the financial turmoil] {{in lang|it}}</ref>

[[File:Circoscrizioni di Catania.png|thumb|150px|The subdivision of the City proper in six ''circoscrizioni'']]
The [[Metropolitan City of Catania]] was established in 2015 and replaced the former [[Province of Catania]]. It includes the city proper and 57 ''comuni'' (municipalities). The population of the Metropolitan City is 1,107,702.<ref name=istat/>

===Metropolitan area===
The Metropolitan area of Catania includes the ''comune'' of Catania (311,584 inhabitants<ref name=istat/>) and 26 surrounding ''comuni''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anci.sicilia.it/aree/area_ct.htm |title=The Metropolitan Area of Catania defined by ANCI Sicilia (National Association of Comuni Italiani) |publisher=Anci.sicilia.it |access-date=5 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208223915/http://www.anci.sicilia.it/aree/area_ct.htm |archive-date=8 December 2010 }}</ref> forming an urban belt (498,650 inhabitants<ref name=istat/>). The total population of the Metropolitan area of Catania is therefore 810,234. The ''comuni'' of the Metropolitan area are:

===City proper===
The city of Catania proper (''comune di Catania'') is divided in six [[Local government|administrative areas]] called ''circoscrizioni''. The current administrative setup was established in 2013, modifying previous setups dating back to 1971, 1978 and 1995.

The six areas are:

[[File:Catania BW 2012-10-06 11-32-08 2 fj.JPG|thumb|[[Giovanni Battista Vaccarini]]'s Duomo façade (1736) is an example of the city's [[Sicilian Baroque]] architecture.]]
The symbol of the city is ''u Liotru'', or the ''Fontana dell'Elefante'', assembled in 1736 by [[Giovanni Battista Vaccarini]]. It portrays an ancient lavic stone elephant and is topped by an Egyptian obelisk from [[Aswan|Syene]]. Legend has it that Vaccarini's original elephant was neuter, which the men of Catania took as an insult to their virility. To appease them, Vaccarini appropriately appended elephantine testicles to the original statue.

The [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] name ''u Liotru'' is a phonetic change of Heliodorus, a nobleman who, after trying without success to become bishop of the city, became a sorcerer and was therefore condemned to the stake. Legend has it that [[Heliodorus of Catania|Heliodorus]] himself was the sculptor of the lava elephant and that he used to magically ride it in his fantastic travels from Catania to Constantinople.<ref>Amari Michele (1933), ''Storia dei Musulmani di Sicilia'', Catania, Nallino, Vol. I, pp. 344–345</ref> Another legend has it that Heliodorus was able to transform himself into an elephant.

The presence of an elephant in the history of Catania is surely connected to both zooarcheology and popular creeds. In fact, the prehistoric fauna of Sicily from the Upper [[Paleolithic]], included [[dwarf elephant]]s. Paleontologist [[Othenio Abel]] suggested that the presence of [[dwarf elephant]]s in [[Sicily]] may be the origin of the legend of the [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]]. [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], after finding the skulls of [[dwarf elephant]]s, about twice the size of a [[human skull]], with a large central [[nasal cavity]] (mistaken for a large single eye socket) supposed that they were skulls of giants with a single eye.

The ''Catanian Museum of [[Mineralogy]], [[Paleontology]] and [[Vulcanology]]'' holds the integral unburied skeleton of an ''[[Elephas falconeri]]'' in an excellent state of conservation. The first inhabitants of Etna molded such lavic artifacts to idolize the mythical proboscidian.

===Classical buildings===
The city has been buried by lava a total of seventeen times in [[recorded history]], and in layers under the present-day city are the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city that preceded it, and the Greek city before that. Many of the [[ancient monument]]s of the Roman city have been destroyed by these numerous incidents. Currently, different ancient remains can be seen and visited in the city centre, as part of an archaeological park (Parco Archeologico Greco-Romano di Catania).

Catania is the first economic and industrial hub of Sicily. The city is famous for its mainly [[petrochemical industry]], and the extraction of [[sulphur]]. In the year 2000, according to Census, Catania was the 14th richest city in Italy, with a GDP of US$6.6 billion (€6.304 billion), which was 0.54% of the Italian GDP, a GDP per capita of US$21,000 (€20,100) and an average GDP per employee of US$69,000 (€66,100).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regione.basilicata.it/dipattivitaproduttive/default.cfm?fuseaction=linkdoc&doc=519&link=527 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040318203933/http://www.regione.basilicata.it/dipattivitaproduttive/default.cfm?fuseaction=linkdoc&doc=519&link=527 |archive-date=18 March 2004 |title=La ricchezza del territorio italiano |publisher=www.regione.basilicata.it |access-date=1 June 2010}}</ref>

In the late-19th century and early-20th century, Catania began to be heavily industrialised, with its several factories and chimneys, often being referred to as Southern Italy's "Manchester".{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The economy of Catania suffered heavily from the bad effects of [[World War I]], and was marked by an economic crisis and recession that culminated in the 1920s.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Since then, the city lost its industrial and entrepreneurial importance.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In the 1930s, Catania remained a small fishing town with derelict and disused industries. However, after the destruction of [[World War II]], Catania's economy began to re-grow in the late-1950s and early-1960s.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The city's economic growth was so rapid and dynamic that it was often nicknamed the ''"Milan of the South"'', or in Italian ''"Milano del Sud"''.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} This rapid economic growth prompted a great number of Sicilians living in the more rural areas, or smaller towns such as Enna, Ragusa and Caltanissetta, to move to the city to seek new jobs.

Today, Catania, despite several problems, has one of the most dynamic economies in the whole of Southern Italy. It still has a strong industrial and agricultural sector, and a fast-growing tourist industry, with many international visitors coming to visit the city's main sights and the nearby Etna volcano. It contains the headquarters or important offices of companies such as [[STMicroelectronics]], and also several chemical and [[pharmaceutical]] businesses. There have been several new business developments to further boost Catania's economy, including the construction of Etnapolis,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.centroetnapolis.it/etnapolis/index.html |title=home |publisher=Centroetnapolis.it |access-date=1 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617005527/http://www.centroetnapolis.it/etnapolis/index.html |archive-date=17 June 2010 }}</ref> a big [[shopping mall]] designed by [[Massimiliano Fuksas]], the same architect who designed the [[FieraMilano]] industrial fair in Milan, or the Etna Valley,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etnavalley.com/ |title=Oggi la chiamano Etna Valley: i progetti, le aziende, il lavoro nel territorio di Catania |publisher=Etnavalley.com |date=29 April 2010 |access-date=1 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527005056/http://www.etnavalley.com/ |archive-date=27 May 2010 }}</ref> where several high-tech offices are located.

[[Tourism]] is a fast-growing industry in Catania. Lately, the administration and private companies have made several investments in the [[hospitality industry]] in order to make tourism a competitive sector in the Metropolitan City. [[Etnaland]], a large [[amusement park|amusement]] and [[water park]] located in [[Belpasso]], is in the metropolitan area of Catania, {{Convert|12|km|mi}} from the city center. It is the largest of its kind in Southern Italy and attracts thousands of tourists, not only from [[Sicily]], but also from the rest of [[Italy]]. According to [[Tripadvisor]] (2018) it is the third-largest water park in [[Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tripadvisor.mediaroom.com/press-releases?item=126033|title=TripAdvisor Announces the Top Amusement Parks and Water Parks Around the Globe in Travellers' Choice Awards}}</ref>

The seaport of Catania is linked to the road-rail distribution hub of [[Bologna]]. In September 2020 [[Mercitalia Logistics]] opened the first full railway route to link the city to Northern Italy. It replaced an older mixed maritime-railway line.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.efanews.eu/item/16869-chep-for-sustainable-freight-transport.html|title=Chep for sustainable freight transport|website=European Food Agency|date=February 2, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210606213233/https://www.efanews.eu/item/16869-chep-for-sustainable-freight-transport.html|archive-date=June 6, 2021|url-status=live}}</ref>

Catania holds the [[Catania-Etna (Hill Climb)|Catania-Etna]] car competition, organized by the [[Automobile Club d'Italia]]. The competition dates back to 1923 and has been taking place on a regular basis (with some gaps) from 1947. Suspended in 2010 due to a serious accident, the 46th edition is planned for the end of June 2021.<ref>{{cite web|title=46a Catania-Etna|url=https://www.cronoscalate.it/events/event/46a-catania-etna/|language=it}}</ref>

From 1960 to 2011 Catania held the International event named ''Trofeo Sant'Agata'', a [[road running]] competition which took place in the streets of the city center, every year on 3 February (the day the [[Festival of Saint Agatha (Catania)|Festival of Saint Agatha]] begins).

The city also hosted a series of International Sports Events: 
* [[1993 Rugby World Cup Sevens qualifying]], and the associated [[Etna Cup]], which was won by the host Sicily team. 
* [[1994 UCI Road World Championships]] (together with Palermo and Agrigento). 
* [[1997 Summer Universiade]] (together with Palermo and Messina). 
* [[2003 Military World Games]] 
* [[2011 Men's EuroHockey Championship III]]. 
* [[2011 World Fencing Championships]] (Italy came out of this competition as the top winning nation with 11 medals, one won by the local fencer [[Paolo Pizzo]]). 
* [[2024 World Company Sports Games]].

==Food and cuisine==
[[Image:Arancini .jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Arancini]]]]
[[Image:Pasta alla Norma (2563876877).jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Pasta alla Norma]]'']]
Food is an important part of Catania's culture and way of life. Local cuisine emphasizes several traits of [[Sicilian cuisine]], whilst developing some of its own character.

[[Street food]] is one of the best ways to experience traditional dishes. [[Arancini]] are perhaps the city's most iconic: they are stuffed rice balls coated in breadcrumbs and deep fried; in Catania, they are shaped like a cone to remind of [[Mount Etna]]. Typical specialties from the city include ''{{lang|scn|cipollina}}'' (puff pastry with onion, tomato, and prosciutto filling), ''bolognese'' (a small pizza topped with tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto, and boiled egg, and covered in puff pastry), ''{{lang|scn|crispelle}}'' (deep fried dough balls with [[ricotta]] or anchovies filling).

During street fairs and religious festivals, street stalls sell ''{{lang|scn|calia e simenza}}'' (toasted chickpeas and pumpkin seeds). Typical from old street markets are ''{{lang|scn|sangeli}}'' (cooked pork blood), ''{{lang|scn|quarumi}}'' (pork tripe), ''{{lang|scn|zuzzu}}'' (pork jelly), ''{{lang|scn|mauru}}'' (edible seaweed), and raw seafood. [[Horse meat]] is very traditional and is sold in shops called ''{{lang|scn|arrusti e mancia}}'' ("roast it and eat it"), which roast the meat in streetside barbecues.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.notiziecatania.it/notizie/catania/cibo-catanese-catania-e-la-patria-della-carne-di-cavallo/|title=Catania, patria della carne di cavallo|date=19 September 2016|access-date=3 October 2019|archive-date=6 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906162256/http://www.notiziecatania.it/notizie/catania/cibo-catanese-catania-e-la-patria-della-carne-di-cavallo/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Apart from street food, typical dishes from Catania are: ''[[pasta alla Norma]]'' (pasta with fried aubergine, tomato sauce and ricotta salata cheese), named after the [[Norma (opera)|namesake opera]] by [[Vincenzo Bellini]]; ''{{lang|scn|pasta cco niuru}}'' (pasta in cuttlefish ink), ''{{lang|scn|maccu}}'' (fava beans purée), ''{{lang|scn|bastaddi affucati}}'' or ''{{lang|scn|brocculi affucati}}'' (stewed cauliflower or broccoli), ''{{lang|scn|caponata}}'' (sautéed vegetables) and ''{{lang|scn|scacciata}}'' (a pie filled with tuma cheese) which is traditional during [[Christmas]]time.<ref>{{citation|url=https://newsicilia.it/cultura/la-scacciata-catanese-le-origini-del-piatto-natalizio-per-eccellenza-della-tradizione-etnea/377264/|title=La scacciata catanese, le origini del piatto natalizio per eccellenza della tradizione etnea|date=26 December 2018|access-date=6 October 2019}}</ref>

Catania is also famous for its ''pasticceria'' (pastries and cakes).

===Influence on the planning of Adelaide, Australia===
The site of what was to become the major [[Australia]]n city of [[Adelaide]] was surveyed and laid out by Colonel William Light, the first Surveyor-General of South Australia. In 1823, Light had fondly written of Catania: "The two principal streets cross each other at right angles in the square in the direction of north and south and east and west. They are wide and spacious and about a mile [1.6&nbsp;km] long". This became the basis for his plan of Adelaide.<ref>Johnson and Langmead, [http://www.catalog.slsa.sa.gov.au/record=b1082509 ''The Adelaide city plan: fiction and fact''], Wakefield Press, 1986.</ref>
