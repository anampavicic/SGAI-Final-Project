'''Balashikha''' ({{lang-rus|Балашиха|p=bəlɐˈʂɨxə}}) is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] in [[Moscow Oblast]], Russia, located on the [[Pekhorka River]] {{convert|1|km|sp=us}} east of the [[Moscow Ring Road]]. Population: {{ru-census|p2021=520,962|p2010=215,494|p2002=147,909|p1989=135,841}}{{Historical populations|3=1926|4=7674|5=1939|6=28766|7=1959|8=57600|9=1970|10=92316|11=1979|12=117906|13=1989|14=135841|15=2002|16=147909|17=2010|18=215494|19=2021|20=520962|type=|footnote=Source: Census data}}

==Etymology==
In [[Finno-Ugric languages]],{{which|date=September 2021}} ''Bala-shika'' means ''land of celebrations, land of laughter and fun.''<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bloshiha.ru/Pages-view-51-word-%F4%E8%ED%ED.html |title=Топонимия Балашихи. |access-date=October 17, 2011 |archive-date=July 26, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726092600/http://www.bloshiha.ru/Pages-view-51-word-%F4%E8%ED%ED.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Finnic peoples]] lived in this area before [[Slavs]].

==Geography==
The city is known for its unique river and waterway system. The [[Pekhorka River]] system covers an area of {{convert|40|km|sp=us}} from north to south and {{convert|20|km|sp=us}} from east to west, and many small lakes and ponds were created by damming to provide water power for the [[cotton mill]]s in the 19th century.

==History==
Balashikha was established in 1830.<ref name="gr">{{cite book|title=Энциклопедия Города России|year=2003|publisher=Большая Российская Энциклопедия|location=Moscow|isbn=5-7107-7399-9|page=35}}</ref> It was granted town status in 1939.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.balashiha.ru/history.php|title=Наш город Балашиха (краткий исторический очерк)|date=July 25, 2011|access-date=February 5, 2018|archive-date=July 25, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725043932/http://www.balashiha.ru/history.php|url-status=bot: unknown}}</ref> Several rural hamlets had existed long before on the site of the modern city.

The city stands on the famous [[Vladimir Highway]], which led out of Moscow to the east. This was the route along which convicted criminals were marched to forced labor camps in [[Siberia]]. The road was renamed [[M7 highway (Russia)|Gorky Highway]] in the Soviet era. The failure of the [[Decembrist Revolt]] against [[Tsar Nicholas I]] led to the execution of its ringleaders and the exile of many nobles to Siberia. Soviet-era schoolchildren were told that the prisoners were marched in chains along this road followed by their wives. In truth, the Decembrist prisoners were sent from [[Saint Petersburg|St.&nbsp;Petersburg]], then the capital of Russia, through Yaroslavl, and not through Moscow and Balashikha, and the story was invented as part of celebrations of the 100th anniversary of the event in 1925.

Between 1830 and 1870, a cotton factory was in operation in the area, with its fabric called Balashikha. A railway station was built at the end of the 19th century, again called Balashikha Station.

As it grew, Balashikha absorbed other villages, including Gorenki, a suburban estate of Count [[Andreas Razumovsky]], and Pekhra-Yakovlevskoye, an estate of Prince [[Galitzine]], the latter being in use for 250 years from 1591 to 1828. This is the site of a stone church, built from 1777 to 1782.

Saltykovka, a part of Balashikha, has long been known for its attractions to the artistic community. [[Isaak Levitan]], the famous landscape painter, lived there in 1879. [[Lev Tolstoy]] was another frequent visitor.

===Soviet period===
Several institutions were founded in Balashikha after the [[October Revolution]], including one dedicated to the production of fur.

During the Soviet era, Balashikha became a major industrial center with industries in metallurgy, aviation industry, cryogenic technology, machinery, and other fields.

Balashikha sent many of its sons to the front to fight the Germans during World War II. Among those who fought and died was [[Ivan Flerov]] who commanded a [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]] rocket division and is remembered by several monuments and museums in the area.

Along with many other [[Russian Orthodox]] Churches, the Cathedral of Saint [[Alexander Nevsky]] was demolished by the government. The cathedral was blown up in the 1960s but was rebuilt, on its original site, in 2002. Additionally, Afghan operatives of the [[KHAD|KhAD]] agency were sent to Balashikha for training under the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]].<ref>https://www.statewatch.org/media/documents/news/2009/mar/afghanistan-ukba-c-of-origin-report.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=August 2024}}</ref>

===Modernity===
The Balashikha Maternity House was designated on July&nbsp;1, 2003, to be the Moscow Oblast Perinatal Center. This facility will now function as a regional perinatal care facility for high-risk mothers and infants and a perinatal health education center for Moscow Oblast.

Although not part of the extensive Moscow subway system, Balashikha is home to many office workers who commute to Moscow each day.  It has several thriving markets and retail centers and is quickly modernizing.  It is surrounded by attractive woodland and countryside.

In January 2015, the city of [[Zheleznodorozhny, Moscow Oblast|Zheleznodorozhny]] was abolished with its territory merged into Balashikha.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is, together with twelve [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|rural localities]], incorporated as '''Balashikha [[City of federal subject significance|City Under Oblast Jurisdiction]]'''—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Moscow Oblast|districts]].<ref name="Ref1406">Law #11/2013-OZ</ref> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], Balashikha City Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as '''Balashikha Urban Okrug'''.<ref name="Ref1569">Law #208/2014-OZ</ref>

In the past, Balashikha served as the [[administrative center]] of [[Balashikhinsky District]]. On January&nbsp;1, 2011, the district was abolished.
