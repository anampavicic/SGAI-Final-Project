== Etymology ==
{{Main|Names of Beijing}}

Over the past 3,000 years, the city of Beijing has had [[names of Beijing|numerous other names]]. The name ''Beijing'', which means "Northern Capital" (from the [[Chinese characters]] {{lang|zh|北}} {{transliteration|zh|běi}} for ''north'' and {{lang|zh|京}} {{transliteration|zh|jīng}} for ''capital''), was applied to the city in 1403 during the [[Ming dynasty]] to distinguish the city from [[Nanjing]] (the "Southern Capital").<ref name="minggov">{{cite journal |jstor = 2718619|title = Governmental Organization of the Ming Dynasty |journal = Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies |volume = 21 |pages = 1–66 |last = Hucker |first = Charles O. |year = 1958 |doi = 10.2307/2718619  | issn=0073-0548}}</ref> The English spelling ''Beijing'' is based on the government's official [[romanization of Chinese|romanization]] (adopted in the 1980s) of the two characters as they are pronounced in [[Standard Mandarin]]. An older English spelling, ''Peking'', was used by Jesuit missionary [[Martino Martini]] in a popular atlas published in Amsterdam in 1655.<ref>Martini, Martino, ''De bello Tartarico historia'', 1654.
* Martini, Martino (1655), ''Novus Atlas Sinensis'', "Prima Provencia Peking Sive Pecheli", p. 17.</ref> Although Peking is no longer the common name for the city, some of the city's older locations and facilities, such as [[Beijing Capital International Airport]], with the [[International Air Transport Association code|IATA code]] PEK, and [[Peking University]], still retain the former romanization.

The single Chinese character abbreviation for Beijing is {{linktext|京}}, which appears on automobile license plates in the city. The official Latin alphabet [[Standardization Administration of China|abbreviation]] for Beijing is "BJ".<ref>[[Standardization Administration of China]] (SAC).

=== Early history ===
The earliest traces of human habitation in the Peking municipality were found in the caves of [[Dragon Bone Hill]] near the village of [[Zhoukoudian]] in [[Fangshan District]], where [[Peking Man]] lived. ''[[Homo erectus]]'' fossils from the caves date to 230,000 to 250,000 years ago. [[Paleolithic]] ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' also lived there more recently, about 27,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/ext/field/beijing/whc/pkm-site.htm|title=The Peking Man World Heritage Site at Zhoukoudian|access-date=7 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309111645/http://www.unesco.org/ext/field/beijing/whc/pkm-site.htm|archive-date=9 March 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Archaeologists have found [[neolithic]] settlements throughout the municipality, including in [[Wangfujing]], located in central Peking.

The first [[ancient Chinese urban planning|walled city]] in Beijing was [[Jicheng (Beijing)|Jicheng]], the capital city of the [[state of Ji]] which was built in 1045 BC.<!--not BCE; see talk--> Within modern Beijing, Jicheng was located around the present [[Guang'anmen]] area in the south of [[Xicheng District]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |title=Beijing's History |url=http://china.org.cn/english/features/beijing/30785.htm |publisher=China Internet Information Center|access-date=1 May 2008|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080501152800/http://www1.china.org.cn/english/features/beijing/30785.htm|archive-date= 1 May 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> This settlement was later conquered by the [[state of Yan]] and made its capital.<ref>Haw, Stephen.

After China was reunified by the [[Sui dynasty]] in 581, Jicheng, also known as [[Zhuo Commandery|Zhuojun]], became the northern terminus of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]]. Under the [[Tang dynasty]], Jicheng as [[Youzhou]], served as a military frontier command center. During the [[An-Shi Rebellion]] and again amidst the turmoil of the late Tang, local military commanders founded their own short-lived Yan dynasties and called the city [[Yanjing]], or the "Yan Capital." Also in the Tang dynasty, the city's name Jicheng was replaced by Youzhou or Yanjing. In 938, after the fall of the Tang, the [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]] ceded [[sixteen Prefectures|the frontier territory including what is now Beijing]] to the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] Liao dynasty, which treated the city as [[Liao Nanjing|Nanjing]], or the "Southern Capital", one of four secondary capitals to complement its "Supreme Capital" Shangjing (modern [[Baarin Left Banner]] in [[Inner Mongolia]]). Some of the [[List of pagodas in Beijing|oldest surviving pagodas in Beijing]] date to the Liao period, including the [[Pagoda of Tianning Temple (Beijing)|Tianning Pagoda]].

The Liao fell to the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jurchen Jin dynasty]] in 1122, which gave the city to the [[Song dynasty]] and then retook it in 1125 during its [[Jin–Song Wars|conquest of northern China]].

After the Qing general [[Yuan Shikai]] forced the abdication of the last Qing emperor and ensured the success of the revolution, the revolutionaries accepted him as president of the new [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. Yuan maintained his capital at Beijing and quickly consolidated power, declaring himself emperor in 1915. His death less than a year later<ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|pp=133–134}}</ref> left China under the control of the warlords commanding the regional armies. Following the success of the [[Kuomintang]]'s [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]], the capital was formally moved to [[Nanjing]] in 1928. On 28&nbsp;June the same year, Beijing's name was returned to Beiping (written at the time as "Peiping").<ref name="columbia encyclopaedia">{{cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |title=Beijing |encyclopedia=[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]] |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Beijing.aspx |access-date=22 July 2009 |edition=6th |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212121906/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Beijing.aspx |archive-date=12 February 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|MacKerras|Yorke|1991|p=8}}</ref>

On 7 July 1937, the 29th Army and the Japanese army in China exchanged fire at the [[Marco Polo Bridge]] near the [[Wanping Fortress]] southwest of the city. The [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] triggered the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], [[World War II]] as it is known in China.

=== People's Republic of China ===
[[File:Tiananmen 13.jpg|thumb|[[Tiananmen]] during People's Republic of China]]
In the final phases of the [[Chinese Civil War]], the [[People's Liberation Army]] seized control of the city peacefully on 31&nbsp;January 1949 in the course of the [[Pingjin Campaign]]. On 1&nbsp;October that year, [[Mao Zedong]] announced the creation of the [[People's Republic of China]] from atop [[Tian'anmen]]. He restored the name of the city, as the new capital, to Beijing,<ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|p=168}}</ref> a decision that had been reached by the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] just a few days earlier.

In the 1950s, the city began to expand beyond the old walled city and its surrounding neighborhoods, with heavy industries in [[Shijingshan District|the west]] and residential neighborhoods in [[Hepingli Subdistrict, Beijing|the north]]. Many areas of the [[Beijing city fortifications|Beijing city wall]] were torn down in the 1960s to make way for the construction of the [[Beijing Subway]] and the [[2nd Ring Road]].

During the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 to 1976, the [[Red Guard (China)|Red Guard]] movement began in Beijing and the city's government fell victim to one of the first purges. By the autumn of 1966, all city schools were shut down and over a million Red Guards from across the country gathered in Beijing for eight rallies in Tian'anmen Square with Mao.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://dangshi.people.com.cn/GB/85039/14329784.html |script-title=zh:毛主席八次接见红卫兵的组织工作 |script-work=zh:中国共产党新闻网 |date=7 April 2011 |language=zh-CN |access-date=27 December 2011 |archive-date=6 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706102741/http://dangshi.people.com.cn/GB/85039/14329784.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> In April 1976, a large public gathering of Beijing residents against the [[Gang of Four]] and the Cultural Revolution in Tiananmen Square [[1976 Tiananmen Incident|was forcefully suppressed]].

In December 1978, the [[Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee|Third Plenum of the 11th Party Congress]] in Beijing under the leadership of [[Deng Xiaoping]] reversed the verdicts against victims of the Cultural Revolution and instituted the [[Chinese economic reform|"policy of reform and opening up."]]

Since the early 1980s, the urban area of Beijing has expanded greatly with the completion of the 2nd Ring Road in 1981 and the subsequent addition of the [[3rd Ring Road (Beijing)|3rd]], [[4th Ring Road|4th]], [[5th Ring Road|5th]] and [[6th Ring Road]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|p=217}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|p=255}}</ref> According to one 2005 newspaper report, the size of newly developed Beijing was one-and-a-half times larger than before.<ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|p=252}}</ref> [[Wangfujing]] and [[Xidan]] have developed into flourishing shopping districts,<ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|p=149}}</ref> while [[Zhongguancun]] has become a major center of electronics in China.<ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|pp=249–250}}</ref> In recent years, the expansion of Beijing has also brought to the forefront some problems of urbanization, such as [[Traffic congestion|heavy traffic]], [[Air pollution|poor air quality]], the loss of historic neighborhoods, and a significant influx of migrant workers from less-developed [[rural area]]s of the country.<ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|pp=255–256}}</ref> Beijing has also been the location of many significant events in recent Chinese history, principally the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].<ref name="BBC News">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4313282.stm Picture Power:Tiananmen Standoff] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217014228/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4313282.stm |date=17 February 2009 }} BBC News.</ref> The city has also hosted major international events, including the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] and the [[2015 World Championships in Athletics]], and the [[2022 Winter Olympics]], making it the first city to ever host both Winter and Summer Olympics.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://huffingtonpost.com/entry/2022-winter-olympics_55bb4805e4b06363d5a1aa34|title=IOC: Beijing To Host 2022 Winter Olympics|agency=Associated Press|date=31 July 2015|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=11 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810230449/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2022-winter-olympics_55bb4805e4b06363d5a1aa34|archive-date=10 August 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Beijing}}
Beijing is situated at the northern tip of the roughly triangular [[North China Plain]], which opens to the south and east of the city. Mountains to the north, northwest and west shield the city and northern China's agricultural heartland from the encroaching desert steppes. The northwestern part of the municipality, especially [[Yanqing District]] and [[Huairou District]], are dominated by the [[Jundu Mountains]], while the western part is framed by ''Xishan'' or the [[Western Hills]]. The [[Great Wall of China]] across the northern part of Beijing Municipality was built on the rugged topography to defend against nomadic incursions from the steppes. [[Mount Ling (Beijing)|Mount Dongling]], in the Western Hills and on the border with [[Hebei]], is the municipality's highest point, with an altitude of {{convert|2303|m}}.

Major rivers flowing through the municipality, including the [[Chaobai River|Chaobai]], [[Yongding River|Yongding]], [[Juma River (China)|Juma]], are all tributaries in the [[Hai River]] system, and flow in a southeasterly direction. The Miyun Reservoir, on the upper reaches of the Chaobai River, is the largest reservoir within the municipality. Beijing is also the northern terminus of the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] to [[Hangzhou]], which was built over 1,400 years ago as a transportation route, and the [[South–North Water Transfer Project]], constructed in the past decade to bring water from the [[Yangtze River]] basin.

The urban area of Beijing, on the plains in the south-central of the municipality with elevation of {{convert|40|to(-)|60|m|ft|abbr=off}}, occupies a relatively small but expanding portion of the municipality's area. The city spreads out in concentric [[Ring Roads of Beijing|ring roads]]. The [[Second Ring Road (Beijing)|Second Ring Road]] traces the [[Beijing city wall|old city walls]] and the [[Sixth Ring Road]] connects satellite towns in the surrounding suburbs. [[Tian'anmen]] and [[Tian'anmen Square]] are at the center of Beijing, directly to the south of the [[Forbidden City]], the former residence of the emperors of China. To the west of [[Tiananmen|Tian'anmen]] is [[Zhongnanhai]], the residence of China's current leaders. [[Chang'an Avenue]], which cuts between Tiananmen and the Square, forms the city's main east–west axis.

Beijing's pattern of development from the old inner city to its urban fringe are frequently described as "spreading like a pancake" (''tan da bing'').<ref name=":02" />{{Rp|page=135}} This pattern of development is frequently cited as a reason for Beijing's urban problems.<ref name=":02" />{{Rp|page=135}}

Autumn, similar to spring, is a season of transition and minimal precipitation. From 2001 to 2024, the hottest period in Beijing is early August, and the coldest period is late January. According to China's seasonal division standard, Beijing enters spring on 26&nbsp;March, summer on 20&nbsp;May, autumn on 13&nbsp;September, and winter on 31&nbsp;October. The average annual temperature in the urban area of Beijing is {{convert|12.9|°C|1}} to {{convert|13.3|°C|1}}, of which the average daily minimum temperature is {{convert|7.7|°C|1}} to {{convert|8.4|°C|1}}, and the average daily maximum temperature is {{convert|18.5|°C|1}} to {{convert|18.9|°C|1}}.

=== Architecture ===
[[File:Views from Jingshan Park 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[The North–South Central Axis of Beijing City]]]]
{{See also|List of tallest buildings in Beijing}}
Three styles of architecture are predominant in urban Beijing. First, there is the traditional architecture of imperial China, perhaps best exemplified by the massive [[Tian'anmen]] (Gate of Heavenly Peace), which remains the People's Republic of China's trademark edifice, the [[Forbidden City]], the [[Imperial Ancestral Temple]] and the [[Temple of Heaven]]. Next, there is what is sometimes referred to as the "Sino-Sov" style, with structures tending to be boxy and sometimes poorly constructed, which were built between the 1950s and the 1970s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Business Guide to Beijing and North-East China |edition=2006–2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2TvFN9DmqkC&q=%22sino-sov%22+%2Barchitecture&pg=PA108 |page=108 |isbn=978-988-98673-3-1 |year=2006 |publisher=China Briefing Media |location=Hong Kong |access-date=22 July 2009 |archive-date=7 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220307165627/https://books.google.com/books?id=M2TvFN9DmqkC&q=%22sino-sov%22+%2Barchitecture&pg=PA108 |url-status=live }}</ref> Finally, there are much more modern architectural forms, most noticeably in the area of the [[Beijing CBD]] in east Beijing such as the new [[CCTV Headquarters]], in addition to buildings in other locations around the city such as the [[Beijing National Stadium]] and [[National Centre for the Performing Arts (China)|National Center for the Performing Arts]].

Since 2007, buildings in Beijing have received the [[CTBUH Skyscraper Award]] for best overall tall building twice, for the [[Linked Hybrid]] building in 2009 and the [[CCTV Headquarters]] in 2013. The CTBUH Skyscraper award for best tall overall building is given to only one building around the world every year.

In the early 21st century, Beijing has witnessed tremendous growth of new building constructions, exhibiting various modern styles from international designers, most pronounced in the CBD region. A mixture of both 1950s design and [[neofuturistic]] style of architecture can be seen at the [[798 Art Zone]], which mixes the old with the new. Beijing's tallest building is the 528-meter [[China Zun]].

[[File:Wangjing SOHO6.jpg|thumb|[[Wangjing SOHO]]]]
Beijing is famous for its ''[[siheyuan]]s'', a type of residence where a common courtyard is shared by the surrounding buildings. Among the more grand examples are the [[Prince Gong Mansion]] and [[Former Residence of Soong Ching-ling (Beijing)|Residence of Soong Ching-ling]]. These courtyards are usually connected by alleys called ''[[hutong]]s''. The ''hutongs'' are generally straight and run east to west so that doorways face north and south for good [[Feng Shui]]. They vary in width; some are so narrow only a few pedestrians can pass through at a time. Once ubiquitous in Beijing, ''siheyuans'' and ''hutongs'' are rapidly disappearing,<ref>{{cite news |last=Shen |first=Wei |title=Chorography to record rise and fall of Beijing's Hutongs |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-02/16/content_306506.htm |work=China Daily |date=16 February 2004 |access-date=27 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308141253/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-02/16/content_306506.htm |archive-date=8 March 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> as entire city blocks of ''hutongs'' are replaced by high-rise buildings.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/?article=1160 |title=Farewell to the Hutongs: Urban Development in Beijing |author=Amy Stone |magazine=[[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent magazine]] |date=Spring 2008 |access-date=14 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519103106/http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/?article=1160 |archive-date=19 May 2011}}</ref> Residents of the ''hutongs'' are entitled to live in the new buildings in apartments of at least the same size as their former residences.

=== Environmental issues ===
Beijing had a long history of [[environmental problems]].<ref>[[J.R. McNeill]], ''Something New Under the Sun: An Environmental History of the 20th-Century World''. New York: Norton, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-14-029509-2}}.</ref> Between 2000 and 2009 Beijing's urban extent quadrupled, which not only strongly increased the extent of anthropogenic emissions, but also changed the meteorological situation fundamentally, even if [[Exhaust gas|emissions]] of human society are not included. For example, surface [[albedo]], wind speed and [[humidity]] near the surface were decreased, whereas ground and near-surface [[air temperature]]s, vertical air dilution and [[ozone]] levels were increased.<ref>[[Mark Z. Jacobson]], Son V. Nghiem, Alessandro Sorichetta, Natasha Whitney, ''Ring of impact from the mega-urbanization of Beijing between 2000 and 2009''. In: ''[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]: Atmospheres'' 120, Issue 12, (2015), 5740–5756, {{doi|10.1002/2014JD023008}}.</ref> Because of the combined factors of urbanization and pollution caused by burning of [[fossil fuel]], Beijing is often affected by serious environmental problems, which lead to [[health]] issues of many inhabitants. In 2013 heavy [[smog]] struck Beijing and most parts of northern China, impacting a total of 600 million people. After this "pollution shock" [[air pollution]] became an important economic and social concern in China. After that the government of Beijing announced measures to reduce air pollution, for example by lowering the share of coal from 24% in 2012 to 10% in 2017, while the national government ordered heavily polluting vehicles to be removed from 2015 to 2017 and increased its efforts to transition the energy system to clean sources.<ref>Peter Sheehan, Enjiang Cheng, Alex English, Fanghong Sun, ''China's response to the air pollution shock''. In: ''[[Nature Climate Change]]'' 4, (2014), 306–309, {{doi|10.1038/nclimate2197}}.</ref>

==== Air quality ====
Joint research between American and Chinese researchers in 2006 concluded that much of the city's pollution comes from surrounding cities and provinces. On average 35–60% of the [[ozone]] can be traced to sources outside the city. [[Shandong]] Province and [[Tianjin]] Municipality have a "significant influence on Beijing's air quality",<ref>David G. Streetsa, Joshua S. Fub, Carey J.

Several place names in Beijing end with ''mén'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|门}}), meaning "gate", as they were the locations of gates in the former [[Beijing city fortifications|Beijing city wall]]. Other place names end in ''cūn'' ({{lang|zh|村}}), meaning "village", as they were originally villages outside the city wall.

People native to urban Beijing speak the [[Beijing dialect]], which belongs to the Mandarin subdivision of [[Chinese spoken language|spoken Chinese]]. This speech is the basis for ''[[putonghua]]'', the standard spoken language used in mainland China and [[Taiwan]], and one of the four official languages of [[Singapore]]. Rural areas of Beijing Municipality have [[Jilu Mandarin|their own dialects]] akin to those of Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing Municipality.

Beijing or [[Peking opera]] is a traditional form of Chinese theater well known throughout the nation. Commonly lauded as one of the highest achievements of [[Chinese culture]], Beijing opera is performed through a combination of song, spoken dialogue, and codified action sequences involving gestures, movement, fighting and acrobatics. Much of Beijing opera is carried out in an archaic stage dialect quite different from Modern Standard Chinese and from the modern Beijing dialect.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Jingxi |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/112926/jingxi |encyclopedia=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |year=2008 |access-date=16 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503130136/https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/112926/jingxi |archive-date=3 May 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Beijing South Railway Station 2094.jpg|thumb|right|[[Beijing South railway station]], one of several in the city]]
Beijing is an important [[transport hub]] in [[North China]] with six [[Ring roads of Beijing|ring roads]], 1167&nbsp;km (725 miles) of expressways,<ref name=19nj>{{cite web|author1=Beijing Municipal Bureau of Statistics|title=Statistical Communiqué on the National Economy and Social Development of Beijing in 2019|url=http://tjj.beijing.gov.cn/EnglishSite/SC/202003/P020200331388719611556.doc|website=Beijing Stat Bureau|access-date=31 May 2020|archive-date=21 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200721162055/http://tjj.beijing.gov.cn/EnglishSite/SC/202003/P020200331388719611556.doc|url-status=live}}</ref> 15 National Highways, nine conventional railways, and six high-speed railways converging on the city.

=== Rail and high-speed rail ===
Beijing serves as a large rail hub in [[Rail transport in the People's Republic of China|China's railway network]]. Ten conventional rail lines radiate from the city to: [[Beijing–Shanghai railway|Shanghai (Jinghu Line)]], [[Beijing–Guangzhou railway|Guangzhou (Jingguang Line)]], [[Beijing–Kowloon railway|Kowloon (Jingjiu Line)]], [[Beijing–Harbin railway|Harbin (Jingha Line)]] (including [[Beijing–Qinhuangdao railway|Qinhuangdao (Jingqin Line)]]), [[Beijing–Baotou railway|Baotou (Jingbao Line)]], [[Beijing–Chengde railway|Chengde (Jingcheng Line)]], [[Beijing–Tongliao railway|Tongliao, Inner Mongolia (Jingtong Line)]], [[Beijing–Yuanping railway|Yuanping, Shanxi (Jingyuan Line)]] and [[Fengtai–Shacheng railway|Shacheng, Hebei (Fengsha Line)]]. In addition, the [[Datong–Qinhuangdao railway]] passes through the municipality to the north of the city.

Beijing also has six [[high-speed rail]] lines: the [[Beijing–Tianjin intercity railway]], which opened in 2008; the [[Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway]], which opened in 2011; the [[Beijing–Guangzhou high-speed railway]], which opened in 2012; and the [[Beijing–Xiong'an intercity railway]] and the [[Beijing–Zhangjiakou intercity railway]], both of which opened in 2019. The [[Beijing–Shenyang high-speed railway]] was completed in 2021.

The city's main railway stations are the [[Beijing railway station]], which opened in 1959; the [[Beijing West railway station]], which opened in 1996; and the [[Beijing South railway station]], which was rebuilt into the city's high-speed railway station in 2008; The [[Beijing North railway station]], was first built in 1905 and expanded in 2009; The [[Qinghe railway station]], was first built in 1905 and expanded in 2019; The [[Beijing Chaoyang railway station]] opened in 2021; The [[Beijing Fengtai railway station]] opened in 2022; and the [[Beijing Sub-Center railway station]] is under construction.

Smaller stations in the city including [[Beijing East railway station]] and [[Daxing Airport station]] handle mainly commuter passenger traffic. In outlying suburbs and counties of Beijing, there are over 40 railway stations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oklx.com/cn/train/province/1753ac4e025e.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060330191134/http://www.oklx.com/cn/train/province/1753ac4e025e.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 March 2006 |script-title=zh:北京市火车站大全 |website=oklx.com |access-date=8 August 2011 }}</ref>

From Beijing, [[Passenger rail transport in China|direct passenger train service]] is available to most large cities in China. International train service is available to [[Mongolia]], Russia, [[Vietnam]] and [[North Korea]]. Passenger trains in China are numbered according to their [[railroad direction|direction]] in relation to Beijing.

=== Roads and expressways ===
{{further|Expressways of Beijing|China National Highways of Beijing}}
[[File:Dongfeng North Bridge (20210502140735).jpg|thumb|View of [[4th Ring Road]] in [[Chaoyang District, Beijing|Chaoyang District]]]]Beijing is connected by road links to all parts of China as part of the National Trunk Road Network. Many [[expressways of China]] serve Beijing, as do 15 [[China National Highway]]s. Beijing's urban transport is dependent upon the [[Ring Roads of Beijing|ring roads]] that concentrically surround the city, with the [[Forbidden City]] area marked as the geographical center for the ring roads. The ring roads appear more rectangular than ring-shaped. There is no official "1st Ring Road". The [[2nd Ring Road]] is located in the inner city. Ring roads tend to resemble [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]] progressively as they extend outwards, with the [[5th Ring Road|5th]] and [[6th Ring Road]]s being full-standard national expressways, linked to other roads only by interchanges. Expressways to other regions of China are generally accessible from the [[3rd Ring Road (Beijing)|3rd Ring Road]] outward. A final outer orbital, the [[G95 Capital Area Loop Expressway|Capital Area Loop Expressway (G95)]], was fully opened in 2018 and will extend into neighboring [[Tianjin]] and [[Hebei]].

[[File:Jingtong Expwy east of Sihui (20230828160357).jpg|thumb|left|[[Beijing–Tongzhou Expressway]]]]
Within the urban core, city streets generally follow the checkerboard pattern of the ancient capital. Many of Beijing's boulevards and streets with "inner" and "outer" are still named in relation to gates in the city wall, though most gates no longer stand. Traffic jams are a major concern. Even outside of rush hour, several roads still remain clogged with traffic.

Beijing's urban design layout further exacerbates transportation problems.<ref>{{cite news |title=Beijingers spend lives on road as traffic congestion worsens |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-10/06/content_269518.htm |work=China Daily |publisher=Xinhua News Agency |date=6 October 2003 |access-date=22 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724004854/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-10/06/content_269518.htm |archive-date=24 July 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> The authorities have introduced several bus lanes, which only public buses can use during rush hour.

Towards the end of 2010, the city government announced a series of drastic measures to tackle traffic jams, including limiting the number of new license plates issued to passenger cars to 20,000 a month and barring cars with non-Beijing plates from entering areas within the Fifth Ring Road during rush hour.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://chinaautoweb.com/2010/12/to-tackle-traffic-jam-beijing-sets-new-car-plate-quota-limits-out-of-towners/ |title=To Tackle Traffic Jam, Beijing Sets New Car Plate Quota, Limits Out-of-Towners |website=ChinaAutoWeb.com |access-date=13 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228031411/http://chinaautoweb.com/2010/12/to-tackle-traffic-jam-beijing-sets-new-car-plate-quota-limits-out-of-towners/ |archive-date=28 December 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> More restrictive measures are also reserved during major events or heavily polluted weather.

Beijing has two of the world's largest airports. The [[Beijing Capital International Airport]] ([[IATA]]: PEK) located {{convert|32|km}} northeast of the city center in [[Chaoyang District, Beijing|Chaoyang District]] bordering [[Shunyi District]], is the [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|second busiest airport in the world]] after [[Atlanta]]'s [[Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Hartsfield–Jackson International Airport]].<ref name="ACI aero" /> Capital Airport's Terminal 3, built during the expansion for the 2008 Olympics, is one of the largest in the world. Capital Airport is the main hub for [[Air China]] and [[Hainan Airlines]]. The [[Airport Expressway (Beijing)|Airport Expressway]] and [[2nd Airport Expressway|Second Airport Expressway]], connect to Capital Airport from the northeast and east of the city center, respectively. Driving time from city center is about 40 minutes under normal traffic conditions. The [[Capital Airport Express]] line of [[Beijing Subway]] and the [[Beijing Airport Bus|Capital Airport Bus]] serves the Capital Airport.

==== Other airports ====
With the opening of the Daxing Airport in September 2019, the [[Beijing Nanyuan Airport]] (IATA: NAY), located {{convert|13|km}} south of center in [[Fengtai District]], has been closed to civilian airline service. Other airports in the city at Liangxiang, Xijiao, Shahe and Badaling are primarily for military use.

The cost of unregistered taxis is also subject to negotiation with the driver.

=== Bicycles ===
[[File:East start of Huilongguan-Shangdi Bicycle Lane (20190607134646).jpg|thumb|Huilongguan–Shangdi bicycle lane]]
Beijing has long been well known for the number of bicycles on its streets. Although the rise of motor traffic has created a great deal of congestion and bicycle use has declined, bicycles are still an important form of local transportation. Many cyclists can be seen on most roads in the city, and most of the main roads have dedicated [[bicycle lanes]]. Beijing is relatively flat, which makes cycling convenient.
