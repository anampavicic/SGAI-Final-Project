'''Tidore''' ({{langx|id|Kota Tidore Kepulauan}}, lit. "City of Tidore Islands") is a city, island, and archipelago in the [[Maluku Islands]] of eastern [[Indonesia]], west of the larger island of [[Halmahera]]. Part of [[North Maluku]] Province, the city includes the island of Tidore (with three smaller outlying islands - [[Mare Island (Indonesia)|Mare]], Maitara and Filonga) together with a large part of Halmahera Island to its east. In the pre-colonial era, the [[Sultanate of Tidore]] was a major regional political and economic power, and a fierce rival of nearby [[Ternate]], just to the north.

==Geography==
Tidore Island consists of a large [[stratovolcano]] which rises from the seafloor to an elevation of {{Convert|1730|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above [[sea level]] at the conical [[Mount Kie Matubu]] on the south end of the island. The northern side of the island contains a [[caldera]], [[Sabale]], with two smaller volcanic cones within it.

[[Soasio]] is Tidore's capital. It has its own port, Goto, and it lies on the eastern edge of the island. It has a mini bus terminal and a market. The sultan's palace was rebuilt with completion in 2010.<ref>[http://kerajaan-indonesia.blogspot.com/2010/03/tidore-north-maluku-has-new-palace.html Kompas]</ref>

==History==
{{See also|Sultanate of Tidore}}
Tidore was the center of a spice-funded sultanate that arose in the 15th century. It spent much of its history in the shadow of [[Ternate]], another sultanate with which it had a dualistic relationship.<ref name="LP" >{{Cite book| last =Witton | first =Patrick | title =Indonesia | publisher =Lonely Planet | year =2003 | location =Melbourne | pages =827–828| isbn=1-74059-154-2 }}</ref>

[[Islam]] spread to Tidore around the late 15th century but Islamic influence in the area can be traced further back to the late 14th century.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Azra|first=Azyumardi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePSkf-DHu5YC&pg=PA26|title=Islam in the Indonesian World: An Account of Institutional Formation|publisher=Mizan Pustaka|year=2006|isbn=978-979-433-430-0|pages=39–40|author-link=Azyumardi Azra}}</ref>

The sultans of Tidore ruled most of southern [[Halmahera]], and, at times, controlled [[Buru]], East [[Seram Island|Ceram]] and many of the islands off the coast of [[New Guinea]].<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993) ''The world of Maluku''. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, p. 99-110.</ref> Tidore established an alliance with the [[Spain|Spanish]] in the sixteenth century, and Spain had several forts on the island. There was mutual distrust between the Tidorese and the Spanish but for the Tidorese the Spanish presence was helpful in resisting the incursions of the Ternateans and their ally the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], who had a fort on Ternate. For the Spanish, backing the Tidore state helped check the expansion of Dutch power that threatened their nearby Asia-Pacific interests, provided a useful base right next to the centre of Dutch power in the region and was a source of spices for trade.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 169-74.</ref>

Although nominally part of the [[Spanish East Indies]] in the later sixteenth century and well into the seventeenth century, the Tidore [[sultanate]] established itself as one of the strongest and most independent states in the region. After the Spanish left in 1663, it continued to resist direct control by the [[Dutch East India Company]] (the VOC). Particularly under Sultan [[Saifuddin of Tidore|Saifuddin]] (r. 1657–1687), the Tidore court was skilled at using Dutch payment for [[spices]] for gifts to strengthen traditional ties with Tidore's traditional peripheral territories. As a result, he was widely respected by many local populations, and had little need to call on foreign military help for governing the kingdom, unlike Ternate which frequently relied upon Dutch military assistance.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 190-2.</ref>

Tidore long remained an independent state, albeit with growing Dutch interference, until the late eighteenth century. Like Ternate, Tidore allowed the Dutch spice eradication program (''extirpatie'') to proceed in its territories.<ref>Muridan Widjojo (2009) ''The revolt of Prince Nuku: Cross-cultural alliance-making in Maluku, c. 1780-1810''. Leiden: Brill, p. 33-7.</ref> This program, intended to strengthen the Dutch spice monopoly by limiting production to a few places, impoverished Tidore and weakened its control over its periphery.

In 1780 Tidore was forced to sign a treaty that reduced it to a Dutch vassal. The discontented Prince [[Nuku of Tidore|Nuku]] left Tidore and declared himself Sultan of the Papuan Islands. This was the beginning of [[Nuku Rebellion|a guerilla war]] which lasted for many years.<ref>Muridan widjojo (2009), p. 55-8.</ref> The Papuans, south-east Halmaherans and east [[Seram Island|Ceramese]] sided with the rebellious Prince Nuku. The British sponsored Nuku as part of their campaign against the Dutch in the Moluccas. Captain [[Thomas Forrest (navigator)|Thomas Forrest]] was intimately connected with Nuku and represented the British as ambassador. Nuku could finally take Tidore in 1797 and helped the British to conquer Ternate in 1801.<ref>Muridan Widjojo (2009), p. 75-88.</ref> However, his successor Zainal Abidin was expelled by Dutch forces in 1806 and Tidore was firmly brought under colonial rule.<ref>Muridan Widjojo (2009), p. 88-94.</ref>

The sultanate was abolished in the [[Sukarno]] era and re-established in 1999 with the 36th sultan.<ref name="LP"/> Tidore was largely spared from the [[Maluku sectarian conflict|sectarian conflict of 1999]] across the Maluku Islands.<ref name="LP"/>

==Administration==
[[File:Indonesia 2000 1000r r.jpg|thumb|right|Tidore Island featured on the Indonesian [[Indonesian rupiah|1,000-rupiah banknote]]]]
The island, together with three smaller islands ([[Mare Island (Indonesia)|Mare]], Maitara and Filonga) and an adjacent much larger section (called "Oba") of [[Halmahera]] Island, constitutes a municipality (''kotamadya'') within the province of [[North Maluku]]. It is officially called the "Tidore Islands City" because it includes four islands (the main island of Tidore, plus the three nearby smaller islands of [[Mare Island (Indonesia)|Mare]], Maitara and Filonga) as well as the Oba area on mainland Halmahera (also including minor offshore islands). The whole municipality covers an area of {{convert|1,703.32|km2|sqmi}} and had a 2010 Census population of 90,530;<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> the 2020 Census produced a total of 114,480<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> and the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 118,613 (comprising 60,041 males and 58,572 females).<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Tidore Kepulauan Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.8272)</ref>

It is divided into eight [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''kecamatan''), of which four constitute the island of Tidore (including the three small islands) and the other four constitute the Oba area on the 'mainland' of Halmahera. These are tabulated below with their areas (in sq km) and their populations at the 2010 Census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and the 2020 Census,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> together with the official estimates as at mid 2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Tidore Kepulauan Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.8272)</ref> The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centres, the number of [[administrative village]]s in each district (totaling 49 rural ''desa'' and 40 urban ''kelurahan''), and its post code.
