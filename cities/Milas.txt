Milas is focused on [[agricultural]] and [[aquaculture|aquacultural]] processing, related industrial activities, services, transportation (particularly since the opening of [[Milas–Bodrum Airport]]), [[tourism]] and culture. The centre lies about 20&nbsp;km from the coast and is closer to the airport than [[Bodrum]] itself, with many late arrival passengers of the high season increasingly opting to stay in Milas rather than in Bodrum where accommodation is likely to be difficult to find.

Milas district has a total coastline length of 150&nbsp;km, both to the north-west in the [[Güllük Gulf|Gulf of Güllük]] and to the south along the [[Gulf of Gökova]], and to these should be added the shores of [[Lake Bafa]] in the north divided between the district area of Milas and that of [[Aydın]] district of [[Söke]].

Along with the province seat of [[Muğla]] and the province's southernmost district of [[Fethiye]], Milas is among the prominent settlements of south-west Turkey, these three centers being on a par with each other in terms of all-year population and the area their depending districts cover. Milas center is situated on a fertile plain at the foot of Mount Sodra, on and around which sizable quarries of white [[marble]] are found and have been used since very ancient times.

==Etymology==
The name ''Mylasa'', with the old [[Anatolia]]n ending in -asa is evidence of very early foundation. On the basis of the ''-mil'' syllable found also in the name the [[Lycians]] called themselves ''Trmili'', a theory connects the name of Mylasa with the passage of the Lycians from [[Miletus]], also claimed to be a Lycian foundation under the name Millawanda by [[Ephorus]], to their final home in the south.{{Citation needed|date=December 2022}} But there is nothing else to suggest a Lycian origin for the name Mylasa.<ref>{{cite book|title = Dynastic Lycia: A political history of the Lycians and their relations with foreign powers, C. 545-362 |ISBN=978-90-04-10956-8|author=Antony G. Keen|publisher=Brill Publishers, Leiden|year= 1998}}</ref> [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] in his ''Ethnica'' says that the city took its name from a certain Mylasus, son of [[Chrysaor]] and a descendant of [[Sisyphus]] and Aeolus, an explanation some sources deem unsubstantial for a Carian city.<ref>{{cite book|title = Turkey beyond the Meander |ISBN=978-0-7195-4663-1|author=George Ewart Bean|publisher=John Murray Publishers Ltd, London|year= 1989}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Zeus Labraundos Temple on a Roman coin of Geta from Mylasa.jpg|thumb|400px|Zeus Labraundos Temple on a Roman coin of emperor [[Geta_(emperor)|Geta]] from Mylasa]]

The city's earliest historical mention is at the beginning of the 7th century BC, when a [[Carians|Carian]] leader from Mylasa by name Arselis is recorded to have helped [[Gyges of Lydia]] in his contest for the [[Lydians|Lydian]] throne. The same episode is at the origin of the accounts surrounding the beginning of the cult for and the erection of the statue of Labrandean Zeus in the neighboring sanctuary of [[Labranda]], held sacred by peoples across western Anatolia, with the statue holding the [[labrys]] brought over by Arselis from [[Lydia]]. 

Labrandean Zeus (''sometimes also named "Zeus Stratios"'') was one of the three deities proper to Mylasa, all named Zeus but each bearing indigenous characteristics. Of these, the cult of Zeus Carius (''Carian Zeus'') was also notable in being exclusively reserved, aside from the Carians, to their Lydian and [[Mysians|Mysian]] kinsmen. One of the finest temples was also the one dedicated to Zeus Osogoa (originally, just ''Osogoa''), {{Clarify|text=traceable to times when the Carians had been a maritime folk and which recalled to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] the [[Acropolis of Athens]].|date=January 2022}}<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece:'' VIII, x, 3.</ref>

===Persian period===
Under [[Achaemenid]] rule Mylasa was the chief city of Caria. A ruler appointed by the [[Persian Empire|Persian Emperor]] ([[satrap]]) ruled the city in varying degrees of allegiance to the emperor. The first dynasty of rulers under the Achaemenid Empire was the [[Lygdamid dynasty]] (520-450 BCE). Between 460-450&nbsp;BC, Mylasa was a regionally prominent member of the [[Delian League]], like most Carian cities, but the Persian rule was restored towards the end of the same century.
[[File:MapaTopográficoDeAsiaMenor-Caria.png|thumb|Map of Milas and neighbouring ancient cities in [[Caria]].]]

====Hecatomnid dynasty====
The [[Hecatomnids]], the dynasty founded by [[Hecatomnus]], were officially [[satrap]]s of the [[Persian Empire]] but Greek in language and culture, as their inscriptions and coins witness. Mylasa was their capital and the mausoleum of Hecatomnus can still be seen today which served as an architectural precedent from which the later mausolea of the dynasty developed. During the long and striking reign of [[Mausolus]], they became virtual rulers of [[Caria]] and of a sizable surrounding region between 377-352&nbsp;BC. During Mausolus's reign the capital was moved to [[Halicarnassus]], but Mylasa retained its importance. Mausolus was the builder of the famous [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Ancient Wonder of the World]], the [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]].

===Roman period===
[[File:Caryatid from Milas, Turkey. Late Hellenistic period, 1st century BCE. Marble. Museum of Archaeology, Istanbul, Turkey.jpg|200px|thumb|left| [[Caryatid]] from Milas, Turkey. Late [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] period, 1st century BCE. Marble. [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums|Museum of Archaeology]], [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]].]]

In 40 BCE Mylasa suffered great damage when it was taken by [[Labienus]] in the [[Roman Civil War]]. In the Greco-Roman period, though the city was contested among the successors of Alexander, it enjoyed a season of brilliant prosperity, and the three neighbouring towns of [[Euromus]], [[Olymos]] and [[Labranda]] were included within its limits. Mylasa is frequently mentioned by ancient writers. At the time of Strabo (the first century BCE), the city boasted two remarkable orators, Euthydemos (in Greek Εὐθύδημος) and Hybreas (Ὑβρέας), whose relationship gave rise to the adage "necessary evil".  Euthydemos and Hybreas were antagonistic politicians, and when Euthydemos died, Hybreas spoke at his funeral, where he noted, ”You are a necessary evil: we can live neither with you nor without you." Various inscriptions tell us that the [[Phrygia]]n cults were represented here by the worship of [[Sabazios]]; the Egyptian, by that of [[Isis]] and [[Osiris]]. There was also a temple of [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]]. An inscription from Mylasa<ref>The inscription was published in ''{{lang|tr|Bulletin de correspondance hellénique}}'', 1890, pp. 621-623.</ref> provided one of the few certain data about the life of [[Cornelius Tacitus]], identifying him as governor of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] in 112-13.

===Christian era===
Among the ancient [[bishop]]s of Mylasa was [[Saint Ephrem]] (fifth century), whose feast was kept on January 23, and whose relics were venerated in neighbouring city of [[Leuke]]. Cyril and his successor, Paul, are mentioned by [[Nicephorus Callistus Xanthopoulos|Nicephorus Callistus]]<ref>[[Nicephorus Callistus Xanthopoulos]]. ''Historia ecclesiastica:'' XIV, 52.</ref> and in the ''Life of Saint Xene''. [[Michel Le Quien]] mentioned the names of three other bishops,<ref>[[Michel Le Quien]]. ''Oriens Christianus'', I, 921.</ref> and since his time the inscriptions discovered refer to two others, one anonymous,<ref>''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum]]'', 9271.</ref> the other named Basil, who built a church in honour of [[Saint Stephen]].<ref>''{{lang|tr|Bulletin de correspondance hellenique}}'', XIV, 616.</ref> The [[Xenia of Rome|Saint Xene]] referred to above was a Roman noblewoman who, to escape the marriage which her parents wished to force upon her, donned male attire, left her country, changed her name from Eusebia to Xene ("stranger"), and lived first on the island of [[Kos|Cos]], then at Mylasa. Since the [[Fourth Crusade]], Mylasa has remained a [[titular see]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], ''Mylasensis''; the seat has been vacant since the death of the last bishop in 1966.<ref>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/d3m19.html Mylasa (Titular See)]; [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10660b.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'': Mylasa"].</ref>

===Turkish era===
[[File:Milas_Gumuskesen_4845.jpg|thumb| The Gümüşkesen is a Roman tomb, from the 2nd century BC. It is reportedly built along the lines of the [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]], but on a much smaller scale]]

====Beys of Menteşe====
Milas and the surrounding region (the Byzantine [[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] of [[Mylasa and Melanoudion]]) was taken over by the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] under the command of Menteşe Bey in the late thirteenth century, who gave his name to the [[Anatolian beyliks|beylik]] ([[Menteşe (beylik)|Menteşe]]) that established its capital in the city. The administrative center of his descendants was the castle of [[Medieval City of Beçin|Beçin]] located in the contemporary dependant township of the same name at a distance of {{convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from Milas and which was easier to defend.

====Ottoman rule====
Milas, together with the entire [[Bey]]lik of [[Menteşe (beylik)|Menteşe]] was taken over by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1390. However, just twelve years later, [[Tamerlane]] and his forces overcame the Ottomans in the [[Battle of Ankara]], and returned control of this region to its former rulers, the Menteşe [[Bey]]s, as he did for other [[Anatolian beyliks]]. Milas was brought back under Ottoman control, this time in 1420 by the Sultan [[Mehmed I]]. One of the first acts of the Ottomans was to transfer the regional administrative seat to [[Muğla]].

From 1867 until 1922, Milas was part of the [[Aidin Vilayet]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. At the turn of the twentieth century, according to 1912 figures, Milas' urban center had a population of 9,000, of whom some 2,900 were [[Greek people|Greek]], a thousand or so [[Jew]]ish, and the remaining majority were [[Turkish people|Turkish]].<ref>According to the same sources, for the whole area covered by the subdistrict (''kaza'') of Milas, these figures were 28,500 for the whole population, 21,000 of which were [[Turkish people|Turkish]] and 3,500 to 7,000, according to varying sources, were Greeks. Data from Anagiostopoulou 1997 and Sotiriadis 1918.</ref> The Greeks of Milas were exchanged with [[Turkish people|Turks]] living in [[Greece]] under the 1923 agreement for the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|exchange of Greek and Turkish populations]] between the two countries, while the sizable Jewish community remained as a presence till the 1950s, at which time they emigrated to [[Israel]]; Jews formerly of Milas still visit frequently to this day.

==Climate==
Milas has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa''),<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Table 1 Overview of the Köppen-Geiger climate classes including the defining criteria. |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02549-6/tables/1 |journal=Nature: Scientific Data |language=en}}</ref> with very hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters.

==Sights of interest==

The Mausoleum of Hecatomnus was discovered in 2010 when men were arrested for illegal digging for antiquities. A marble sarcophagus and numerous frescoes were discovered in the tomb, although it was believed many relics had already been taken from the tomb and sold on the black market.<ref>The Tomb of Hecatomnus - Milas, Turkey: https://archive.archaeology.org/1101/topten/turkey.html</ref> Recently a golden crown from the tomb has been identified and agreed to be returned to Turkey.<ref>Golden crown of Hecatomnus to be returned to Turkey: https://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2017/12/golden-crown-of-hecatomnus-to-be.html#H4j4Ai1DMFq2gekO.99</ref> The tomb is very important for understanding of Carian art and craftsmanship as it was built by their best architects and sculptors and was a predecessor of the magnificent [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]].

The walls surrounding the ''[[temenos]]'' of one of the temples dedicated to one of the [[Zeus]] (''probably Zeus Osogoa'' and built in the first century BC) are still visible, as well as a row of columns.

The eighteenth-century English traveller [[Richard Pococke]] relates, in his ''Travels'', having seen the temple of [[Augustus]] here; its materials have since partially been taken by Turks to build a [[mosque]].

One of the two ancient symbols of the town is "Baltalıkapı" (''Gate with an axe''), a well-preserved [[Roman Empire|Roman]] gate called as due to the eponymous double-headed axe ([[labrys]]) carved into a keystone.

There is also a two-storied monumental Roman tomb dating from the 2nd century AD, called "Gümüşkesen" today and which gives its name to a whole quarter of Milas, and referred to as "Dystega" in some dated sources. This monument is most likely a simplified copy of the famous tomb of [[Mausolus]] in [[Halicarnassus]].

There are a number of historical Turkish buildings in Milas, dating from both the [[Menteşe (beylik)|Menteşe]] and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] periods. A number of old houses built in the nineteenth or early twentieth century that have been preserved in their original appearance are also worthy of mention. Among the three most important mosques of Milas, The Great Mosque dating from 1378 and Orhan Bey Mosque dating from 1330 were built when Milas was the capital of the Turkish principality of Menteşe. The slightly more imposing Firuz Bey Mosque was built shortly the first incorporation of Milas into the Ottoman Empire and bears the name of the city's first Ottoman administrator.

[[Milas carpet|Milas carpets and rugs]] woven of wool have been internationally famous for centuries and bear typical features. In our day, they are no longer produced in the city of Milas, but rather in a dozen villages around Milas. For the whole territory of Milas district, up to 7000 weavers' [[loom]]s remain active, either full-time or at intervals following the demand, which remains quite lively both in Turkey and abroad.

[[Beçin]] Castle, the capital of [[Menteşe (beylik)|Menteşe]] Beys, is situated at the dependent township of Beçin, at a distance of 5&nbsp;kilometers from Milas city. The fortress has been restored in 1974, and the compound includes two [[mosque]]s, two ''[[medrese]]s,'' a ''[[Turkish bath|hamam]],'' the remains of a [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] [[chapel]] as well as traces from earlier periods.

At a distance of 14&nbsp;km. from Milas center, set on a steep hillside and surrounded by pine forests is the ancient Carian cult center of [[Labranda]], its name echoing once again the eponymous tradition of labrys. The ruins, including a temple, banqueting halls and tombs, were excavated by a [[Sweden|Swedish]] team in early 20th century, as well as the views over the valley, attract the interest of rather few adventurous visitors prepared for the climb.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[Gökçeler Canyon]] and [[İncirliin Cave]] inside the canyon are visitor attractions.
