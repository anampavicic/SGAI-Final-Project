'''Tây Ninh''' ({{Audio|Tây Ninh.oga|listen|help=no}}) is a [[Provincial city (Vietnam)|provincial city]] in [[Đông Nam Bộ|Southeastern]] Vietnam. It is the capital of [[Tây Ninh Province]], which encompasses the town and much of the surrounding farmland. Tay Ninh is one of nine provinces and cities in the ''Southern Key Economic Region'' (''[[Hochiminh City]], [[Đồng Nai Province|Dong Nai]], [[Binh Duong]], [[Ba Ria – Vung Tau]], [[Binh Phuoc]], [[Tay Ninh]], [[Long An]] and [[Tien Giang]]''). Tây Ninh is approximately {{convert|90|km|mi|round=5|abbr=in}} northwest of [[Ho Chi Minh City]], Vietnamese largest city and 182 km (113 miles) to [[Phnom Penh]], capital of [[Cambodia]]. As of 2019, the city had a population of 135,254 over the provincial population of 1,169,165, and a total area of {{convert|140|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name="TN">{{cite web|url=http://tayninh.gov.vn/TinTuc/tintuc/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=4490|title=Resolution on establishing Tay Ninh City|publisher=Tay Ninh Portal|access-date=9 Feb 2014}}</ref>

==Agriculture and manufacturing industry==

With its vast agricultural land covering over 85% of the natural land area (equivalent to 370,000 ha), favorable hot and humid climate all year round, relatively flat terrain, and the presence of the Vam Co Dong river and Dau Tieng reservoir bed irrigation system, Tay Ninh has excellent natural and climate conditions. These factors guarantee a consistent water supply for hundreds of thousands of hectares of agricultural land, making it an ideal location for cultivating a wide range of tropical agricultural products. Rubber, sugar cane, and cassava are the most commonly grown crops in Tay Ninh nowadays.

Phuoc Dong Industrial Park, one of the largest industrial zone in Vietnam and Southeast Asia, is situated 24 miles away from the city. The park covers an area of 2,190 ha and is part of a larger complex spanning 3,285 ha, which includes Go Dau and Trang Bang districts. The strategic location of Phuoc Dong complex provides easy access to the Ho Chi Minh City - Moc Bai Expressway, Thanh Phuoc transshipment port, and Moc Bai international border gate.
