'''Governador Valadares''' is a Brazilian [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] in the countryside of [[Minas Gerais]]. In 2020, its population was 281,046 inhabitants, thus being the ninth most populated city in the state.<ref name="IBGE2" /> It is an economical axis of the middle valley of the [[Doce River]] (Rio Doce, lit. "Sweet River"), having a significant influence on the east and northeast portion of Minas Gerais and local authorities of the state of [[Espírito Santo]]. Governador Valadares sits on the bank of the Doce River (Rio Doce), 324&nbsp;km from [[Belo Horizonte]], the state's capital. Governador Valadares has an area of about 2 342&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, of which only 58&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is urban area.

The discovery of the city started at the beginning of the 16th century, that explored the [[Doce River]] searching for precious metals. The settlement began between the 18th and 19th centuries, constructing barracks destined to keep an eye at the Amerindians, who used to attack the settlers and merchants. With the construction of the EFVM ([[Vitória-Minas Railway]]), in 1907, the settlements were consolidated. The growth of the population and commercial development was improved due to the location of the city, that was near to coffee farms and wood extraction fields. The municipality was emancipated from [[Peçanha]] in the 1930s.

After the 1940s, the extraction of precious metals brought a notable population growth, along with livestock and commerce. However, with the decline of natural resources, the money could only be earned through the investment of immigrants, who would later go to other countries. Commerce is the most important source of income in the city, along with [[agribusiness]] and regional manufactured products.

==History==

=== Colonization of the region ===
Today's location of the municipality of Governador Valadares was found to be inhabited by Amerindians for at least 10 thousand years and registers from the first explorers of the region after Brazil's discovery, in 1500, provides us information that they were still numerous on that occasion.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.valadares.mg.gov.br/abrir_arquivo.aspx/Diagnostico_caracterizacao_geral_do_municipio?cdLocal=2&arquivo=%7B64DC8181-E112-B640-6A1B-ACE07ED43A42%7D.pdf|title=PMSB}}</ref> The exploration of this region began in the 16th century, with expeditions like the ones from Sebastião Fernandes Tourinho, that went by the Rio Doce route in the search for precious metals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ibge.gov.br/cidadesat/painel/historico.php?lang=_ES&codmun=312770&search=minas-gerais&#124;governador-valadares&#124;infograficos:-historico|title=IBGE}}</ref> Fernandes Tourinho went through the inverse route of the river until finding the [[Santo Antônio River (Doce River)|Santo Antônio River]],<ref name=":0" /> but the settlement was prohibited in the beginning of the 17th century, due to the efforts to not having ways to have illegal gold extraction on the [[Diamantina, Minas Gerais]] region.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.circuitomataatlantica.tur.br/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=159|title=CTMAMG|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221134958/http://www.circuitomataatlantica.tur.br/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=159|archive-date=2014-02-21}}</ref>

The settlement was allowed on 1755<ref name=":1" /> and to guarantee to safety of the colonizers and merchants that used the [[Doce River]], barracks were installed with the mission to keep an eye on the [[Botocudos]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://cidades.ibge.gov.br/painel/historico.php?codmun=312770|title=IBGE}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.valadares.mg.gov.br/Materia_especifica/12094/Historia-da-Cidade|title=Valadares}}</ref> The barrack of Baguari was the first territory of today's municipality and along with him, near settlements also appeared, one of them being Figueira, that correspond to today's municipality. The Amerindians were seen as a threat to the colonizers and the barracks worked as a strategy of forcing them to leave the region. Near Figueira, in 1818, the D.Manoel barrack was created, on the left side of the [[Doce River]], working as a little port that attended to military service and would also form a trading post.<ref name=":0" /> Later, the settlement was ranked up to a district subjected to [[Peçanha]] by the provincial law nº 3.198 of [[September 23]] of 1884, coming to be called Santo Antônio da Figueira.<ref name=":2" />
