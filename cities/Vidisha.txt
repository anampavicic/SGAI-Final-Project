'''Vidisha''' (‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡§ø‡§∂‡§æ, formerly known as '''Bhelsa''' and known as '''Besnagar''' and '''Bhaddilpur''' in ancient times) is a city in central [[Madhya Pradesh]], India. It is located 62.5&nbsp;km northeast of the state capital, [[Bhopal]]. The name "Vidisha" is derived from the nearby river "Bais", mentioned in the [[Puranas]].<ref>{{cite book |title=CORPUS INSCRIPTIONS INDICARUM VOL II PART II |date=1963 |publisher=GOVERNMENT EPIGRAPHIST FOR INDIA, OOTACAMUND |page=[https://archive.org/details/corpusinscriptio014676mbp/page/n58 9] |url=https://archive.org/details/corpusinscriptio014676mbp}}</ref>

The district was created as Bhilsa District in 1904 by joining the tehsils of Vidisha (also known as Bhilsa) and Basoda (but not Basoda State) which were then part of Gwalior state. After India's independence in 1947, the former princely state of Gwalior became part of [[Madhya Bharat]] state, which was formed in 1948.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Kulke|first=Hermann|title=The History of India: An Introduction|publisher=[[Books Treasure]]|year=2021|isbn=9789384385637}}</ref>

VidishƒÅ was the administrative headquarters of '''Bhelsa''', or '''Bhilsa''', during the Medieval period. It was renamed Vidisha in 1956.<ref name="Britannica">{{cite web |title=Vidisha |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Vidisha |website=Encyclopaedia Britannica |publisher=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, inc. |access-date=20 April 2020}}</ref> Vidisha is also amongst the 112 Aspirational District in the Aspirational District Programme launched by NITI Aayog in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |title=List of 112 Aspirational Districts |url=https://www.niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2022-09/List-of-Aspirational-Districts.pdf |website=niti.gov.in}}</ref> 
Towards the seventh or eighth century, Bhadravati was raised from its ruins by a Bheel chieftain, who surrounded it with walls, and gave it the name of Bhilsa. When, in the year 1230, the Emperor Altamsh took possession of it, it was the seat of a Rajpoot prince of the Chohan clan. It was not, however, finally wrested from the Hindoos until the year 1570, under Akbar.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rousselet |first=Louis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bGvU-sQyb-4C&dq=bhilsa+bheel&pg=PA424 |title=India and Its Native Princes: Travels in Central India and in the Presidencies of Bombay and Bengal.

==History==
===Besnagar===
[[File:Map_of_Besnagar.jpg|thumb|Relative locations of the [[Heliodorus pillar]], [[Besnagar]], Vidisha, [[Sanchi]] and the [[Udayagiri Caves]].]]
The town is situated east of the [[Betwa River]], in the fork of the Betwa and Bes rivers, 9&nbsp;km from [[Sanchi]]. The town of Besnagar, 3&nbsp;km from present-day Vidisha on the west side of the river, became an important trade centre in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE, under the [[Shunga Empire|Shungas]], [[Nagas of Vidisha|Nagas]], [[Satavahana]]s, and [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]]s, and was mentioned in the [[PƒÅli|Pali]] scriptures. The Emperor [[Ashoka]] was the governor of Vidisha during his father's lifetime. His Buddhist Empress Vidisha Devi who was also his first wife, was brought up in Vidisha. It finds mention in [[Kalidasa]]'s ''[[Meghaduta]]''.<ref name=":0" />

The ruins of Besnagar were inspected by [[Alexander Cunningham]] in 1874‚Äì1875.<ref name="AC">{{cite book |title=Report Of Tours In Bundelkhannd And Malwa Vol X 1874-75 |date=1880 |pages=36‚Äì46 |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.407745/page/n37}}</ref> Remains of a large defensive wall were found on the western side of the city.<ref name="AC"/> Ancient Buddhist railings were also found just outside of the city, which had probably adorned a [[stupa]].<ref name="AC"/> Numerous coins were found, including nine coins of the [[Western Satraps]].<ref name="AC"/>

The [[Heliodorus Pillar]] is a stone column, which was constructed in about 150 BCE. This stone column was erected by the Greek ambassador of the Indo-Greek King [[Antialcidas]], who came to the court of Bhagabhadra, a possible [[Sunga Empire|Sunga]] king. Dedicated to Lord [[VƒÅsudeva]], this column was constructed in front of the temple of VƒÅsudeva. The pillar is situated about four kilometers away from the city on Vidisha-Ganj Basoda SH-14, located on the northern bank of the Vais River. It is a 20 feet and 7 inches tall stone pillar, commonly called ''Kham Baba''.<ref name="AC"/> The script used in the inscription is [[Brahmi script|Brahmi]] but the language is [[Prakrit]], recording that [[Heliodorus pillar|Heliodorus]] erected the pillar as a Garuda Stambha to pay homage to Lord Vasudeva, who was later integrated as a manifestation of Lord [[Vishnu]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Paul|first=Pran Gopal|date=December 1989|title=Brahmanical Imagery in the Ku·π£ƒÅ·πáa Art of MathurƒÅ: Tradition and Innovations|journal=[[East and West (journal)|East and West]]|volume=39|pages=111‚Äì143|via=JSTOR}}</ref>

Besnagar was known as Bhelsa during the medieval period.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} It became famous for the temple of Sun god Bhillasvamin.<ref>Art & architecture of Da≈õƒÅr·πáa (Malwa) Region, Rahman Ali, Sharada Pub. House, 2008, p. 14</ref> It was ruled by the [[Later Gupta dynasty|Later Gupta]] king [[Devagupta]] of Malwa and [[Rashtrakuta]] king [[Krishna III]]. The name is first noted in an inscription of 878 CE by a merchant Hatiaka of [[Parwar (Jain community)|Paravada]] community.<ref>(Malwa Through the Ages, from the Earliest Times to 1305 A.D, K.C. Jain, p. 485</ref> The 12th-century [[Acharya Hemachandra|Tri-shashthi-shalaka-purusha-charitra]] mentions an image of Bhillasvamin at Vidisa, along with a copy of [[Jivant Swami]] buried in the sand.<ref>Gleanings of Indian archaeology, history, and culture: R.N. Mehta commemoration volume, Volume 1, 2000,  p. 263</ref> Minhajuddin's [[Minhaj-i-Siraj|Tabaqat-i-Nusiri]] states that the temple was destroyed by [[Iltutmish]] in 1233‚Äì34 CE.<ref>Madhya Pradesh: District Gazetteers, Volume 42, V. S. Krishnan, Government Central Press p.30</ref>

In 1293, [[Alauddin Khalji]] of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] [[Alauddin Khalji's raid on Bhilsa|sacked the city]] as a general of [[Jalal ud din Firuz Khalji|Sultan Jalaluddin]]. The attack was illustrative of Vidisha's importance in the medieval era.<ref>[Studies in the Religious Life of Ancient and Medieval India, Dineschandra Sircar, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1971, p. 117]</ref> In 1532 Bhilsa was sacked by Bahadur Shah of Gujarat Sultanate. It then passed on to the [[Malwa]] [[Sultans]], the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] and the [[Scindia]]s.

Near the eastern edge of the old town are the remains of a large temple of the late [[Paramara dynasty|Paramara]] period known as the '''Bijama·πá·∏çal'''. The building was probably started in the second half of the 11th century. That it was never finished is evidenced by the unfinished carved niches and architectural pieces found round the base of the temple plinth.<ref>O. P. Mishra, "Bijama·πá·∏çal and CarccikƒÅ: Tutelary Goddess of the ParamƒÅra King Naravarman," ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society'' 22, 1 (2012), pp. 107‚Äì113.</ref> On top of the plinth is a small mosque made using pillars, one of which has an inscription dating probably from the time of king Naravarman (''circa'' 1094‚Äì1134). It is a devotional inscription revering CarccikƒÅ (i.e. CƒÅmu·πá·∏çƒÅ), of whom he was a devotee.<ref>H. V. Trivedi, ''Inscriptions of the ParamƒÅras, Chandellas, KachchhapaghƒÅtas and Two Minor Dynasties'', Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, volume 7 in 2 parts (New Delhi, 1978-91) 2: 120-22.</ref> The ''mi·∏•rƒÅb'' suggests the mosque was constructed in the late 14th century. To one side of the Bijama·πá·∏çal is a store house of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] containing many sculptures collected in the neighbourhood. A step-well of the 7th century is in the same campus and has, beside the entrance, two tall pillars with K·πõ·π£·πáa scenes. These are the earliest K·πõ·π£·πáa scenes in the art of central India. The dimensions of Bijamandal Temple at Vidisha are comparable to those of [[Konark]] in Orissa.

'''Lohangi Pir''' is a rock formation in Vidisha District that derives its name from Shaykh Jalal Chishti, a saint who was locally known as Lohangi Pir. This small domed building is a tomb, which has two Persian inscriptions on it. One of the inscriptions dates back to 1460 CE, while the other is from 1583 CE. The tank and a large bell-capital dating back to the 1st century BCE can be seen on the nearby hill. Near the tomb are the remains of a medieval temple that survived as a pillared crypt. These are dedicated to Goddess Annapurna. Lohangi is a large rock right in the heart of Vidisha, within walking distance of the railway station, is of religious and historical significance in the region.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://travellingslacker.com/2013/10/vidisha-udaygiri-caves-heliodoros-pillar-and-bija-mandal/ | title=Home &#124; the Travelling Slacker | date=17 September 2020 }}</ref>

'''Udaygiri''' is less than 10&nbsp;km from Vidisha town. It is a series of at least 20 caves, containing both Hindu and Jain sculptures from the Gupta Era, sometime between the 4th and 5th century CE. According to Jain texts, Tirthankara Sheetal Nath attained nirvana here. It is basically a small hill where intricate sculptures have been cut out of the rocks.

'''[[Maladevi temple]]''' is a grand Portal of ninth century CE, situated on the eastern slope of a hill and built on a huge platform cut out of the hillside and strengthened by a massive retaining wall, Maladevi temple's imposing structure provides a panoramic valley view, in Gyaraspur, about 40&nbsp;km from Vidisha along NH-86.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holidayiq.com/Maladevi-Temple-Vidisha-Sightseeing-1018-12089.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116035457/http://www.holidayiq.com/Maladevi-Temple-Vidisha-Sightseeing-1018-12089.html |archive-date=16 January 2013 |title=Maladevi Temple {{!}} Maladevi Temple Photos {{!}} Vidisha Tourist Places}}</ref>

'''Hindola Torana''' - Hindola means a swing and Torana is an arched gate - is a magnificent artwork of the 9th century or medieval period, situated in Gyaraspur. It is a developed, ornamental and decorated arched gate made of sandstone. On both of its pillars, Lord Vishnu's ten incarnations are engraved. Near it, four carved and sculpted pillars and beams seem to be the ruins of Trimurthy temple set on one raised platform, as Lord Shiva, Lord Ganesha, Goddess Parvati and their servants are sculpted on these pillars and beams. The gate may be an entrance gate for a temple for Vishnu, Shiva or Thirumurthy.

'''[[Bajramath Temple]]''' is situated in Gyaraspur, on NH-146 behind the Sub-Judicial Magistrate and Tehsildar's Office. The temple faces the east,  and was a Hindu temple later transformed into a [[Jain]] temple. It is just opposite the hill on which Maladevi temple is situated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holidayiq.com/Bajramath-Temple-Vidisha-Sightseeing-1018-12091.html |title=Bajramath Temple, Vidisha {{!}} History, Timings, Reviews, Photos {{!}} HolidayIQ.com |website=www.holidayiq.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009134921/http://www.holidayiq.com/Bajramath-Temple-Vidisha-Sightseeing-1018-12091.html |archive-date=2014-10-09}}</ref>

'''Dashavtar Temple''' is situated on the north of the local lake, where ruins of a group of small Vaishnava shrines can be found. These small Vaishnava shrines are popularly known as Sadhavatara Temple. The temple comprises a large open pillared hall, in which the pillars are dedicated to the ten incarnations of Vishnu. These pillars date back from 8th to 10th century CE. Towards the western bank of the lake lie the ruins of sati pillars that date back to 9th or 10th century CE. One of these pillars is carved with four sculptured faces that depict a seated group of Hara-Gauri.

'''Girdhari Temple''', which is known for its sculptures and fine carvings, is a popular attraction in Sironj. The ancient shrines of Jatashankar and Mahamaya are located close to this temple. Jatashankar Temple is situated 3&nbsp;km towards the south-west of Sironj in the forest area. On the other hand, Mahamaya Temple is situated 5&nbsp;km south-west of Sironj.

'''Udayeshwara Temple''', located in Udaipur village of the Basoda Tehsil, is one of the most prominent Hindu shrines in the region. The inscriptions found in this temple suggest that the Udaipur Town was founded by the Parmara King Udayaditya during the 11th century CE. Other inscriptions found at the temple suggest that Parmara King Udayaditya dedicated it to Lord Shiva.
