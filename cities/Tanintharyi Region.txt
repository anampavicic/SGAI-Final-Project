'''Tanintharyi Region''' ({{langx|my|တနင်္သာရီတိုင်းဒေသကြီး}}, {{IPA-my|tənɪ́ɰ̃θàjì táɪɰ̃ dèθa̰ dʑí|pron}}; [[Mon language|Mon]]: {{lang|mnw|ဏၚ်ကသဳ|italics=no}} or {{lang|mnw|ရးတၞင်သြဳ|italics=no}}; formerly '''Tenasserim Division''' and '''Tanintharyi Division''') is a [[administrative divisions of Myanmar|region]] of [[Myanmar]], covering the long narrow southern part of the country on the northern [[Malay Peninsula]], reaching to the [[Kra Isthmus]]. It borders the [[Andaman Sea]] to the west and the [[Tenasserim Hills]], beyond which lie [[Thailand]], to the east. To the north is the [[Mon State]]. There are many islands off the coast, the large [[Mergui Archipelago]] in the southern and central coastal areas and the smaller [[Moscos Islands]] off the northern shores. The capital of the division is [[Dawei]] (Tavoy). Other important cities include [[Myeik, Myanmar|Myeik]] (Mergui) and [[Kawthaung]]. The division covers an area of {{Convert|43,344.9|km2}}, and had a population of 1,406,434 at the 2014 Census.

==Names==
Tanintharyi has historically been known by a number of names, reflecting changes in administrative control throughout history, as the region changed hands from the [[Kedah Sultanate]], to the [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom|Hanthawaddy]], [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] and [[Konbaung dynasty|Konbaung kingdoms]], and [[British rule in Burma|British Burma]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia |last2=Cho Mar |first2=Ma Tin |last3=Trang |first3=Pham Huong |last4=Faculty of Social Sciences, Economics & Management International School, Vietnam National University, Hanoi, Vietnam |date=2020-07-31 |title=Malay minorities in The Tenasserim coast |url=https://scholarhub.ui.ac.id/ajce/vol4/iss1/12/ |journal=ASEAN Journal of Community Engagement |volume=4 |issue=1 |doi=10.7454/ajce.v4i1.1069|s2cid=225075113 |doi-access=free }}</ref> The region is called '''''Tanah Sari''''' in Malay, '''''Tanao Si''''' ({{langx|th|ตะนาวศรี}}, [[Royal Thai General System of Transcription|RTGS:]] Tanao Si, {{IPA|th|tā.nāːw sǐː|pron}}) in Thai, {{my|ဏၚ်ကသဳ}} and  {{my|တနၚ်သြဳ}} in Mon. In 1989 the division's [[English language|English]] name was officially changed from '''Tenassarim''' to Tanintharyi.

Tanintharyi Region historically included the entire Tanintharyi [[Salient (geography)|salient]]—today's Tanintharyi Region, Mon State and southern [[Kayin State]]. The northernmost region was part of the [[Thaton Kingdom]] before 1057, and the entire coastline became part of [[Anawrahta|King Anawrahta]]'s [[Pagan Empire]] after 1057. After the fall of Bagan in 1287, the area fell to the Siamese kingdom of [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]], and later its successor [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]]. The region's northernmost border was around the [[Salween|Thanlwin (Salween) river]] near today's [[Mawlamyine|Moulmein]].

The region reverted to Burmese rule in 1564 when King [[Bayinnaung]] of [[Toungoo Dynasty]] conquered all of Siam. Ayutthaya had regained independence by 1587, and reclaimed the southern half of Tanintharyi in 1593 and the entire peninsula in 1599.<ref name=dos>{{Cite journal | url=http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/limitsinseas/IBS063.pdf | title=International Boundary Study: Burma-Thailand Boundary | date=1966-02-01 | publisher=Bureau of Intelligence and Research, US Department of State | access-date=25 December 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331082313/http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS063.pdf | archive-date=31 March 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1614, King [[Anaukpetlun]] recovered the northern half of the coast to [[Dawei]] but failed to capture the rest.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Helen James |url=https://archive.org/details/southeastasiahis00ooik |title=Southeast Asia: a historical encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East Timor |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2004 |isbn=9781576077702 |editor=Ooi |editor-first=Keat Gin |editor-link=Keat Gin Ooi |page=[https://archive.org/details/southeastasiahis00ooik/page/n326 302] |url-access=limited}}</ref> Tenasserim south of Dawei (Tavoy) remained under Siamese control.

For nearly seven decades, from the middle of the 18th century to the early 19th century, Burma and Siam were involved in [[Burmese–Siamese wars|multiple wars]] for control of the coastline. Taking advantage of the Burmese civil war of 1740–1757, the Siamese cautiously moved along the coast to the south of [[Mottama]] in 1751. The winner of the civil war, King [[Alaungpaya]] of [[Konbaung Dynasty]] [[Burmese–Siamese War (1759–1760)|recovered the coastline]] to Dawei from the Siamese in 1760. His son King [[Hsinbyushin]] [[Burmese–Siamese War (1765–1767)|conquered the entire coastline]] in 1765.<ref name=geh-202/> In the following decades, both sides tried to extend the line of control to their advantage but they both failed. The Burmese used Tanintharyi as a forward base to launch several unsuccessful invasions of Siam ([[Burmese–Siamese War (1775–1776)|1775–1776]]; [[Burmese–Siamese War (1785–1786)|1785–1786]]; [[Burmese–Siamese War (1809–1812)|1809–1812)]]; the Siamese too were unsuccessful in their attempts to retake Tanintharyi ([[Burmese–Siamese War (1787)|1787]] and [[Burmese–Siamese War (1792)|1792]]).<ref name=app>{{Cite book| title=History of Burma|author=Lt.

Burma ceded the region south of [[Salween river]] to the [[British Empire|British]] after the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] (1824–1826) under the [[Treaty of Yandabo]]. The British and the Siamese signed a boundary demarcation treaty on 20 June 1826, and another one in 1868.<ref name=dos/> Mawlamyine (Moulmein) became the first capital of British Burma. The British seized all of [[Lower Burma]] after the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]] of 1852, and moved the capital to Rangoon. After 1852, the Tanintharyi Region consisted the entire southeastern part of Myanmar, including today's [[Mon State]], [[Kayin State]], and Taungoo District, in Bago Region. Mawlamyine was the capital of Tanintharyi.<ref name=md>{{Cite web| url=http://www.statoids.com/umm.html | title=Myanmar Divisions | access-date=2009-04-10 | publisher=Statoids}}</ref>

Upon independence from Britain in 1948, the northeastern districts of Tanintharyi were placed into the newly created Karen State. In 1974, the northern part of remaining Tanintharyi was carved out to create Mon State.<ref name=md/> With Mawlamyine now inside Mon State, the capital of Tanintharyi Region was moved to Dawei.

===Ethnic groups===
The region is home to ethnic Dawei, Karens, Mons, Burmese Thai, Myeik, [[Burmese Malays]], Bamar migrants and [[Moken]]s. The Dawei speak the [[Tavoyan dialect]], a variety of Burmese with profound pronunciation and vocabulary differences from standard Burmese.

==Economy==
[[File:The Myeik Archipelago 39.jpg|thumb|200x200px|A fishing boat in the [[Mergui Archipelago]]]]
Due to its proximity to the [[Indian Ocean]], seafood products, including dried fish, dried prawn, dried shrimp and [[ngapi]] (shrimp paste), are a major part of its economy, for both domestic consumption and export to Thailand. [[Edible bird's nest|Bird's nests]] are also gathered from offshore islands.[[File:The Myeik Archipelago 37.jpg|thumb|200x200px|Children play on an island in the [[Mergui Archipelago]]]]

The region is also home to several metal mines, including Heinda, Hamyingyi, Kanbauk, Yawa, Kyaukmetaung, Nanthida and Yadanabon. Pearls are also cultured on Pearl Island.

In recent years, large-scale [[palm oil]] and [[Hevea brasiliensis|rubber tree]] plantations have been established in region.

All of Tanintharyi's 7 universities and colleges are located in Dawei and Myeik. Until recently, [[Dawei University]] was the only four-year university in the Region.

==Health care==
The general state of [[health care in Myanmar]] is poor. The government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the country's GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=108&subsecID=900003&contentID=254167 | title=PPI: Almost Half of All World Health Spending is in the United States | date=2007-01-17 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205231908/http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=108&subsecID=900003&contentID=254167 | archive-date=5 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2007/06/28_Burma.shtml  | title=Burma junta faulted for rampant diseases | date=2007-06-28 | author=Yasmin Anwar | publisher=UC Berkeley News}}</ref> Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment. Moreover, the health care infrastructure outside of [[Yangon]] and [[Mandalay]] is extremely poor. In 2003, the entire Tanintharyi Region had fewer hospital beds than the [[Yangon General Hospital]]. The following is a summary of the public health care system.<ref name=cso-hosp>{{Cite web | url=http://www.etrademyanmar.com/STATS/s0413.htm | title=Hospitals and Dispensaries by State and Division | access-date=2009-04-11 | publisher=Myanmar Central Statistical Organization | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430032618/http://www.etrademyanmar.com/STATS/s0413.htm | archive-date=30 April 2011}}</ref>
