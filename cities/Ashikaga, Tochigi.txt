==History==
[[File:Ashikaga overview.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Ashikaga from a nearby Mountain]]
During the [[Heian Period]], Ashikaga was developed by [[Minamoto no Yoshikuni]], whose descendants later became the [[Ashikaga clan]]. The area was noted from this period for its academy, the [[Ashikaga Gakkō]]. During the [[Edo period]], it was the center of [[Ashikaga Domain]] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. Following the [[Meiji restoration]], the town of Ashikaga within [[Ashikaga District, Tochigi]] was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. It was elevated to city status on January 1, 1921. Ashikaga annexed the neighboring village of Keno on March 3, 1951, and the town of Yamabe on April 1, 1953. This was followed on August 1, 1954, by the villages of Mie and Yamamae, and on November 1, 1954, by the villages of Kitago and Nagusa. On April 1, 1959, Ashikaga annexed the village of Tomita, and the northern half of the village of Yabagawa on July 1, 1960. On October 1, 1962, Ashikaga annexed the towns of Mikuriya and Sakanishi. Ashikaga District was dissolved by this final merger.
