It is quite close to the city of [[Lagos]], and located on the north bank of Porto Novo Creek, an inland waterway that connects Lagos (Nigeria's largest city and economic capital) to the [[Beninese]] capital of [[Porto-Novo]].

Serving as a lagoon and an Atlantic port, Badagry emerged as a commercial center on the [[West Africa]]n coast between 1736 and 1851.{{Sfn|Sorensen-Gilmour|1995|p=II, 3}} Its connecting and navigable [[lake]]s, creeks and inland lagoons acted as a means to facilitate trade and as a security bar for residents. During the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, the town was a middleman between European traders on the coast and traders from the hinterland.{{Sfn|Sorensen-Gilmour|1995|p=2-3}}

== Geography ==
Badagry is situated on the [[south-west]] coast of Nigeria, bordered by the [[Gulf of Guinea]] to the south. It is located 43 miles (69&nbsp;km) southwest of Lagos and 14 miles (23&nbsp;km) east of [[Seme Border|Seme]], a border town in [[Benin Republic]].<ref name="lynn" /> Like Lagos Island, it is on the bank of inland [[lagoon]]s, a system of creeks, waterways that are navigable to Lagos and [[Porto Novo]]. The distance between the lagoon and the [[ocean]] varies along the coast, in Badagry, the distance is about a mile.<ref name="lynn" /> The depth of the lagoon varies according to the season, from highs of 3 meters to lows of a meter. The lagoons have a diverse fish population that includes [[Ethmalosa fimbriata|bonga]], [[Pseudotolithus|croaker]], longfin [[pompano]], [[tilapia]] and [[Chrysichthys|catfish]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Seasonal distribution and richness of fish species in the Badagry Lagoon, south-west Nigeria {{!}} Request PDF|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238451038|access-date=2020-07-11|website=ResearchGate|language=en}}</ref> The lagoon consists of [[brackish]] and [[freshwater]] with seasonal variability; west of Badagry, [[Yewa River]] provides [[water]] inflow to the lagoon.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Soyinka |first1=O.

==History==
There is a traditional [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] narrative that the first settlement within the area was an [[Awori tribe|Awori]] group originally from [[Ile-Ife]] who lived at a nearby settlement. Robin Law,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Professor Robin Law FBA |url=https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/fellows/robin-law-FBA/ |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=The British Academy |language=en}}</ref> a [[scholar]] of [[History of West Africa|West African history]], notes an origin that sprouted out of a resettlement for displaced peoples of varied ethnic groups, mostly [[Ogu people]], [[Ewe people]] and [[Oyo empire|Oyo Yorubas]]. Another source links the people living at a settlement called Gberefu as the Ewe's of Oyo, an island along the Atlantic coast.<ref name="lynn">{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Lynn|title=Sea ports and sea power: African maritime cultural landscapes|date=2017|location=Cham|isbn=9783319469850|language=en}}</ref>

One of the recorded notable events in the history of Badagry was the acquisition of land by a European trader who was locally known as Yovo Huntɔkonu. Yovo or Yevu means a white person in Gbe languages.{{Sfn|Sorensen-Gilmour|1995|p=38-40}} Many sources identify the European to be a Dutch trader called Hendrik Hertogh.<ref name="caro">{{cite thesis |type=PhD |last=Sorensen-Gilmour |first=Caroline|date=1995 |title=Badagry 1784-1863.

He reached the settlement called Apa under the [[Oba (ruler)|Obaship]] of Alapa and he was given farmland to use for trading.<ref name="caro"/>

The name Badagry was said to be derived from the city's indigenes' methods of subsistence, which include fishing, farming, and salt production. Others think the city was called after Agbede(blacksmith in Yoruba and Gbe languages)a well-known farmer whose okra farm, Agbadarigi or Agbedeglime(inside blacksmith’s wall) was corrupted to Badagry by Europeans. Badagry served as a corridor for Europeans to carry slaves to new destinations in the early eighteenth century. Its cenotaph is called "'''Point of No Return''',<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-12-01 |title=History of Atlantic Slave Trade Chronicled By Museums, Monuments in Badagry, Nigeria |url=https://globalpressjournal.com/africa/nigeria/history-atlantic-slave-trade-chronicled-museums-monuments-badagry-nigeria/ |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=Global Press Journal |language=en-US}}</ref>" and the well at this location was charmed to make slaves who drank from it forget their fate. Badagry was one of the routes that benefited from the ongoing slave trade conflict between [[Porto-Novo|Portnovo]] and [[Dahomey]] at the end of the eighteenth century. Slaves taken during inter-villages [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] were auctioned off at Badagry.<ref name="hometown.ng">{{Cite web|date=2016-12-09|title=Badagry Festival {{!}} Hometown.ng™|url=https://hometown.ng/listing-item/badagry-festival/|access-date=2021-08-02|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904084700/https://hometown.ng/listing-item/badagry-festival/ |archive-date=4 September 2017}}</ref>

Chief Mobee was one of the African chiefs who participated in the slave trade in 1883. In Marina, Badagry, the first two-story structure was constructed in 1845.<ref name="hometown.ng"/>

===1736–1840===
Huntokonu set up a trading post on the gifted land in 1736 and it was after Huntɔkonu settlement that Badagry emerged as a [[Dutch Slave Coast|slave port]], serving principally as an outlet for [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]] and displacing [[Apa, Lagos|Apa]] politically and commercially.{{Sfn|Sorensen-Gilmour|1995|p=135-137}} During this period, political refugees fleeing [[aggression]] from King [[Agaja]] Trudo migrated to Badagry.{{Sfn|Sorensen-Gilmour|1995|p=37-40}}  Agaja who was seeking an outlet to the [[sea]] was warring across the coast and the resulting war caused an influx of people living along the [[Dutch Slave Coast|coast]] of [[Keta|Anlo]], Keta, [[Ouémé Department|Weme]], Quidah, Allada, [[Godomey|Ajatche]], and [[Grand Popo|Popos]] to settle in Badagry.<ref name="caro" /> These group came to be known as Ewes/Ogu. Each migrant group were affiliated with Eight heterogeneous quarters{{Sfn|Sorensen-Gilmour|1995|p=35-40}} and newly arrived immigrants settled in wards related to their state of origin. {{Sfn|Sorensen-Gilmour|1995|p=5-6}}Badagry's wards were headed by commercial and political autonomous chiefs thereby creating a fragmented political structure.<ref name="caro" /> This flexibility was advantageous for trade but also caused internal instability.<ref name="caro" />

Slave trading did not take place on the same massive scale in Badagry as occurred in [[Kingdom of Bonny|Bonny]], [[Angola]], Ouidah, and [[Akwa Akpa|Calabar]];{{Sfn|Sorensen-Gilmour|1995|p=54}} In 1865, the amount of slaves transported out of Badagry was 800, while at Porto Novo, the figure was 1,200, and at Ouidah, up to 5,000 slaves were transported.<ref name="caro" /> The peak period of the slave trade in the city state was between 1736 and 1789, but the trade continued into the early nineteenth [[century]], with Portuguese or Brazilian traders taking over from the Dutch.{{Sfn|Sorensen-Gilmour|1995|p=55-57}}

The rise of Badagry on the coast led to hostilities with Ouidah, which combined with Oyo and Lagos to sack the town in 1784.<ref name="caro" /><ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Law|first=Robin|date=1978|title=THE CAREER OF ADELE AT LAGOS AND BADAGRY, c. 1807 - c. 1837|journal=Journal of the Historical Society of Nigeria|volume=9|issue=2|pages=35–59|jstor=41857061|issn=0018-2540}}</ref> After the destruction, Jiwa a political [[refugee]] from Porto-Novo took over the reins of  most of the political structures between 1784 and 1788.{{Sfn|Sorensen-Gilmour|1995|p=9}}  In 1821, [[Adele Ajosun|Oba Adele]] was exiled to Badagry, he proved to be a source of leadership, and was able to make Badagry a politically independent state.<ref name=":0" />  The founding of [[Abeokuta]] also proved beneficial to Badagry as the former made use of Badagry as an outlet for trading.<ref name="caro" /> Adele was involved with the famous trader, [[Efunroye Tinubu|Madam Tinubu]] and sided with Egba's in their conflict with Ota and Ijebu.{{Sfn|Sorensen-Gilmour|1995|p=196-200}} Among Adele's  followers from Lagos were Muslims, mostly [[Domestic worker|servants]] from the Northern region, this group introduced Islam to the Ogu people in the city-state.<ref name="caro" />

After the British abolished the slave trade, notable trader [[Francisco Félix de Sousa]] migrated to Badagry around 1807.<ref name="caro" /> Trade in ivory, cloth and palm oil were also important economic activities of residents. Thomas Hutton established a presence in Badagri in 1838, other British traders followed in subsequent years.{{Sfn|Sorensen-Gilmour|1995|p=11}} Unlike in the interior, Badagry's soil  was not suitable for commercial [[agriculture]], but farms were set up in areas surrounding the town.{{Sfn|Sorensen-Gilmour|1995|p=58}} The [[palm oil]] trade was of considerable value to Badagry, as was an illegal trade in slaves directed by Brazilians. The influence of anti-slave trade raids and cession of Badagry to Britain put a stop to the trade.<ref name="caro" />

===1840–1900===
Badagry's location as a coastal town with links northwards to Abeokuta and Oyo made it a port of entry for [[Emigration|emigrants]] from Sierra Leone and missionaries.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Aladeojebi, Gbade.|title=History Of Yoruba Land.|date=2016|publisher=Partridge Publishing|isbn=978-1-4828-6248-5|oclc=1147867988}}</ref> Around 1837, a settled Sierra-Leonean emigrant of the [[Methodist Church Nigeria|Methodist]] faith wrote a letter requesting a catechist in Badagry. The Methodist already had a missionary party in the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], and some members were sent to Badagry.<ref name=":1" /> this party was led by [[Thomas Birch Freeman]] and Charles DeGraft. The Methodist missionaries first preached under an [[Agiya Tree Monument|Agia tree]] and later erected a makeshift [[bamboo]] Church.{{Sfn|Sorensen-Gilmour|1995|p=215}}

In 1845, a [[Church Mission Society|CMS]] missionary party arrived in town Badagry. In the party were Revs, [[Henry Townsend (missionary)|Townsend]], [[Samuel Ajayi Crowther|Crowther]] and Gollmer, two teachers from Sierra Leone, some [[Carpentry|carpenters]] and wives of the party members.<ref name="caro" /> The intention of the part was to keep on moving to Abeokuta but as a result of the death of Sodeke, a chief in Abeokuta, they were delayed at Badagry. The party stayed in Badagry for a year and a half, building a mission house with two levels.{{Sfn|Sorensen-Gilmour|1995|p=234}}  [[Eugene Celadon Van Cooten| Eugene Van Cooten]] joined the mission in 1850.<ref>[https://vc.id.au/blog2/transcriptions/eugene-van-cooten/ Van Cooten voices website, ''Eugene Van Cooten'']</ref>

However, Christian [[proselytism]] in the first half of the nineteenth was not successful in Badagry partly as a result of a [[Civil war|civil]] war between 1851- 1854 and also as a result of Lagos becoming a British colony.<ref name="caro" /> In the years between the founding of the colony of Lagos and [[Colonial Nigeria|colony of Nigeria]], Badagry lost influence to Lagos.<ref name=":1" />

In 1863, wary of French influence in Porto-Novo, [[Lagos Colony|colonial Lagos]] signed a [[treaty]] of [[cession]] with Badagry chiefs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fọlayan|first=Kọla|title=The Career of Thomas Tickel in the Western District of Lagos, 1854-1886|date=1969|journal=Journal of the Historical Society of Nigeria|volume=5|issue=1|pages=27–46|jstor=41856821|issn=0018-2540}}</ref>

The [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1884–1885, led to the displacement of the Gbe ethnolinguistic groups in the area, with especially the Badagry-Ogu/Ewe ethnic group falling under the British rule, and marginalized through being removed from the rest of the [[ethnolinguistic group]].<ref name=":2">{{cite journal |last1=Kunnuji |first1=Joseph |title=Guided syncretism: repackaging Badagry-Ogu music in the context of Lagos' postcolonial modernity |journal=African Music |date=2017 |volume=10 |issue=3 |page=79 |doi=10.21504/amj.v10i3.2197 |url=http://journal.ru.ac.za/index.php/africanmusic/article/view/2197 |access-date=13 November 2018}}</ref>

Gbede:gli:me- Gbe languages - Inside the blacksmith’s walls.

The first settler was a blacksmith known as Gbede or Agbede who relocated there from Porto Novo area and started an [[okra]]/okro farm.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Badagry Area Guide |url=https://nigeriapropertycentre.com/area-guides/lagos/badagry |access-date=2022-07-24 |website=nigeriapropertycentre.com |language=en}}</ref> In order to protect his farm from wild animals, he erected a low mud wall.

=== Quarters ===
The city-state of Badagry was divided into eight wards with each having a [[Tribal chief|traditional head.]] The eight wards  are Jegba (Akran, The ruling house), Asago (Bala), Ganho (Agoloto), Posuko (Possu), Boeko (Mobee), Ahoviko (Wawu), Ahwanjigo (Jengen), and Wharakoh(vihento).<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|last1=Lagos State (Nigeria)|title=Focus on [name of administrative division|last2=Ministry of Information and Culture|last3=Public Information Department|date=1991|publisher=The Dept.|location=Ikeja|language=en|oclc=32240791}}</ref>

== Twentieth century ==
Between 1953 and 1965, Badagry was a divisional [[headquarters]] for an area composed of Badagry, [[Amuwo-Odofin]], Ojo, and [[Ajeromi-Ifelodun]]. When Lagos State was created in 1967, it became one of the five administrative zones of the state.<ref name=":3" />

== Culture ==
A number of [[festival]]s are celebrated in Badagry, including  the [[Zangbeto|Ajido Zangbeto]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ajido Zangbeto Festival Archives |url=https://m.guardian.ng/tag/ajido-zangbeto-festival/ |access-date=2022-06-02 |website=The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News |language=en-US}}</ref> cult, Igunnuko festival and Badagry [[diaspora]] and heritage festivals.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-12-04|title=Lagos hosts Badagry heritage festival|url=https://www.sunnewsonline.com/lagos-hosts-badagry-heritage-festival/|access-date=2020-07-11|website=The Sun Nigeria|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-01-24|title=Day Zangbeto Festival shut down Badagry|url=https://www.sunnewsonline.com/day-zangbeto-festival-shut-down-badagry/|access-date=2020-07-11|website=The Sun Nigeria|language=en-US}}</ref> Ajido Zangbeto festival was supported by Lagos state, various groups, like the royal father's , women of Zangan,  Yonnusi, Kregbeto, Zan holu, Ohugigo, and others danced as friends guests and tourists paid tribute to the king, Aholu Saheed Sedonu Adamson, Topon Toviaga 1, of Ajido kingdom. Aholu Adamson said, "Zangbeto" is a socio cultural heritage that is celebrated in high esteem with commitment by the Egun (Ogu) people. Ajido keyed into the Lagos state Government's proclamation that Lagos state was the hub of tourism.<ref name=":4" />  The native language of Badagry is Ewe/egun (Ogu)a [[dialect]] of Aja/Ewe and similar to the Fon language, an Aja sub-group that is spoken in Porto-Novo.<ref name=":2" />

Ancient Badagry had a traditional religion close to vothun and various traditional places of worship. [[Shrine]]s were located in different quarters of the town including Nabruku at Ijegba, Vlekete at Posuko, and Mathe at Adariko. In modern Badagry, adherents of Islam and Christianity populate the town.<ref name=":3" />

Zangbeto masquerade is a powerful cultural form  among the Ogu (Egun) people. This particular masquerade is one of the traditional ways of crime control, policing and security among Egun people of Badagry. Zangbeto’s primary aim is to secure the community. The masquerade  also serves to  entertain people as they dance by spinning around fast, shrinking and growing in height as the masquerade turns.

An illusion about Zangbeto masquerade dates back to when an Egun man was said to have been pursued by his enemies, Egun man needed to flee from his hometown unnoticed in the night. But then, it was said to have used supernatural powers to disguise himself, not to be caught by his enemies which are after his life. He covered his body with dried leaves and raffia and by making scary sounds with the horns of an animal. He was eventually able to leave the town unharmed and undetected by his enemies. He later found a settlement called 'Hugbonu' and subsequently, had men with him dressed in a similar manner; the men helped him secure the settlement as well as preventing attacks on him. This was beginning of the Zangbeto masquerade.

Zangbeto masquerade could do a lot of interesting things with the help of magic/ supernatural powers. This is the main reason they are held in high esteem by the Ogu (Egun) people and are regarded as deity. There are public displays of power such as crossing rivers by walking on water, turning bucket of water into wine as well as dancing bottles. Zangbeto watch over the community at night wandering around to detect thieves and dispense justice. They are followed by a group of drummers and makes an 'eerie' humming noise to announce their arrival. During the night watch their horn sounded to announce the beginning of the watch and also to alert people that the group is about coming out, using the magical powers, Zangbeto masquerade  could notice anyone loitering within a radius of 500 metres and above. Aside securing lives, they also help to settle disputes and make peace among Ogu ( Egun people)  Zangbeto masquerade serves numerous function in the lives of the Egun people of Badagry.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-11-13 |title=The 'Magical' Zangbeto Masquerade Of Egun People |url=https://everyevery.ng/the-magical-zangbeto-masquerade-of-egun-people/ |access-date=2022-08-19 |website=EveryEvery |language=en-US}}</ref>

Agemo Francis Sewanu, a mixed media Nigerian Artist, was born in Badagry Lagos, in 1986. He studied fine Arts at the Delta State University Abraka from where he graduated in 2008. Agemo, whose works have been influenced by the Thron, Atinga, Tolegba and Tovothun,( gods and goddess) of Egun (ogu) people is representing Nigeria. Francis Sewanu Agemo art has evolved over the years through the upbringing with his grandparents, who are faithful worshipers of the Thron, Atinga and Tovothun (gods and goddess of Egun people). Francis Sewanu Agemo had enriching cultural encounters at the shrine and these have informed his artistic development. Agemo, who spoke to vanguard in an exclusive interview stated that " he has over time developed his forms and figures that bear semblance to the objects of worship like totems, statues, masks and raffia threads. Francis Sewanu Agemo made us known that his art poses a look at the duality between tradition and Contemporaneity .

Francis Sewanu Agemo, art exhibition which opened on September 19 and run till September 23, Agemo's works are attracting a lot attention from other artists, curators and art lovers of other cultures who are obviously fascinated to be witnessing original African culture, especially from the ancient international slave town of Badagry, transmitted to them in art form. This magic, Agemo told vanguard is made possible " with my artistic philosophy which he made possible " with my artistic philosophy which I refer to as Tracontemporary- A blend of traditions that is not alienated from contemporary realities and transformations.

Agemo is a kind of historian on canvas. His paintings are mostly narrations of fragmental histories and societal discussions, political issues, ancestral rites and abandoned beliefs. Most times Francis Sewanu Agemo tell stories on his canvass about abandoned beliefs, culture and tradition of his people one of the famous works of Agemo is titled "The lucky woman", which he did during a residency at Alexis Galleries, Lagos. "This work," said Agemo, "is talking about a man who has two wives but the first wife is not able to give the man a male child. All her children are girls. So the man is now looking for another wife that can give him the male children he needs. Here, he finds the woman. Though she is ugly and deformed ( she has only one eyes) she is able to give the man the child he looking for." The message in this work is that physical appearance- ugliness and deformity don't really count. Which it comes to productivity and achievements. These things are not hindrance to success in life. There is an inner beauty, and that is what counts. One may look ugly in appearance but the character or product of that person may be what is desirable. The ugly and the deformed woman is the one who is able to produce the male child; hence she becomes the lucky woman, which is where the title of the work was derived from.

Agemo believes that the world is very small. It may be smooth or rough which is a reality of life;  everyday as we go out, we may meet good or bad.

Good and bad all work together says Agemo.

The governor of the state, Governor Sanwo-Olu urged the [[Nigerian Ports Authority]] (NPA) to build two additional Seaports, one in [[Lekki]] and another in Badagry. He said "Lagos State needs to have two other [[Port]]s, which will not only serve us but also build the national [[economy]]. We have initiated the development of [[Lekki Port|Lekki]] Sea Port, which has started. We are building another Port in Badagry. But we are still in conversation with the NPA to grant the approval because we have added five developers, [[Investor|financiers]], and partners on the Badagry Port. If we can finish the construction of both Sea Ports, it would free up.the congestion in the Apapa axis and create a new [[business]] hub for our people".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sanwo-Olu seeks Badagry, Lekki Seaports' approval|url=https://punchng.com/sanwo-olu-seeks-badagry-lekki-seaports-approval/|access-date=2021-02-06|website=Punch Newspapers|date=16 September 2019 |language=en-US}}</ref>
