==History==
The name "St. Lucie" is originally derived from the name of a [[Settler colonialism|settlement]] near [[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter Inlet]] which was founded on [[Saint Lucy|St. Lucia's day]] in 1566. Due to numerous errors, the name later came to be associated with the present day town of [[St. Lucie Village, Florida]], north of present-day Port St. Lucie. After "[[Spanish Florida|La Florida]]" and "[[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]]," it is the oldest still-in-use European place name in the United States.<ref name="bcsh">[http://johneriksen.net/feb/BooksByEbook-Browser/BrevardCountyHistoryTo1955.pdf Eriksen, John M., ''Brevard County...A Short History to 1955'']</ref> In the early 1890s, an early [[American pioneer|pioneer]] settlement named Spruce Bluff was located along the St. Lucie River, which consisted of a community of several families with a school, post office, pineapple plantation, and [[sawmill]]. Currently, the land the settlement was located on is part of the Spruce Bluff Preserve. Along with an old cemetery near the old settlement, the [[Nature reserve|preserve]] also contains a hiking area, canoe access, observation areas, and a prehistoric [[Ais people|Ais]] [[Indian mound]] located on the southern end of the preserve.

In the 1950s, the land that would eventually become Port St. Lucie was a largely uninhabited tract of land south of [[White City, St. Lucie County, Florida|White City]], composed of a fishing camp (Burt Pruitt's Fishin' Farm) along the St. Lucie River,<ref>https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5de44ae3f5155d068a49c948/t/5deed79499d5d037ef4c0b4e/1575933850366/DodgeBurtArticlePrint.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref> a few farms and businesses near [[U.S. Route 1 in Florida|U.S. 1]]. In 1958, with a budget of $50 million, the [[General Development Corporation]] (GDC) purchased the River Park development and {{convert|40000|acre|km2}} along the North Fork of the St. Lucie River.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portstluciehistoricalsociety.org/pslhistory2.htm |title=The New Pioneers |work=Port St. Lucie Historical Society |access-date=October 1, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005034303/http://www.portstluciehistoricalsociety.org/pslhistory2.htm |archive-date=October 5, 2008}}</ref> In 1959, the GDC opened its first bridge over the St. Lucie River, allowing for direct automobile access to Port St. Lucie.

By February 25, 1961, there were 250 homes in the new city. GDC requested the state legislature to incorporate {{convert|70|mi|km}}, along with the River Park settlement, into the City of Port St. Lucie. River Park did not incorporate into the city at the request of its residents. Port St. Lucie became a city on April 27, 1961, with the passage of House Bill No. 953, proposed by State Representative Rupert Smith and approved by Florida Governor [[C. Farris Bryant]].<ref name=PSLInc/><ref>{{Cite web|title=Early PSL|url=https://pslhistory.org/early-psl|access-date=2021-03-15|website=PORT ST. LUCIE HISTORICAL SOCIETY|language=en-US}}</ref>

In the early 1990s, Core Communities (CC), acquired and began planning what would become [[St. Lucie West]]. Originally, St. Lucie West was to have contained about 14,000 homes over a 20-year period on {{convert|7|sqmi|km2}}. But after realizing the community's strategic position, they began developing it into more than just a residential area. CC began building business sectors and places of entertainment and leisure. That resulted in 7,000 jobs being brought to the small town, helping it into its boom during most of the early 2000s.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

In 2006, CC started development of its newest community, [[Tradition, Florida|Tradition]]. The community, which sits west of the [[Interstate 95]] interchange with Gatlin Blvd., was a large cattle ranch before CC began to develop it. There they built around {{convert|13000000|sqft|m2}} of commercial area, and room for over 18,000 residences. According to CC's website, Tradition is the largest fully entitled residential development area from the tip of Interstate 95 to the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–U.S. border]]. It is modeled after a 1950s-era town. According to its website, Tradition Square, the town center of the community, holds festivities year-round. It was also chosen as the site of [[HGTV|HGTV's]] [[List of programs broadcast by HGTV#Former programming|Green Home]] in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|title=HGTV Green Home 2009|url=https://www.hgtv.com/sweepstakes/hgtv-smart-home/hgtv-green-home-2009|access-date=2021-03-15|website=HGTV|language=en}}</ref>

In 2007, the housing market began to collapse and unemployment started to rise. As of February 2009, unemployment was at 10½ percent and in 2008, nearly 11,000 homes went into [[foreclosure]]. This prompted the county government to consider declaring itself a disaster area. Doing so would have given county administrators access to $17 million in county emergency reserve funds. That money, combined with a transportation fund and other accounts, would give St. Lucie $20 – $30 million to spend on building projects: [[research park]]s, highways and other infrastructure improvements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100824167|title=Hard-Hit Boomtown Considers Emergency Measures|date=18 February 2009|work=NPR|access-date=28 February 2015}}</ref>

In 2008, Tradition and Core Communities welcomed the Florida Center of Innovation (later renamed Tradition Center for Innovation), a 150-acre privately owned research park dedicated to drug discovery, immunology and medical devices, and healthcare. TCI initially composed of [[Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies]], Oregon Health and Science University's Vaccine and Gene Therapy Institute (VGTI), Martin Health System Hospital (Tradition Medical Center), and Mann Research Center. In 2015, VGTI shut down their TCI facility, and Mann Research Center soon followed. As of 2019, only Torrey Pines and Tradition Medical Center remain in TCI.

In 2017, TAMCO, a subsidiary of City Electric Supply, a family-owned electrical [[wholesale business]], created plans with the Port St. Lucie City Council to construct a $38 million, 400,000 square foot manufacturing and distribution center located in the Tradition Commerce Park.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/local/st-lucie-county/2017/10/13/port-st-lucie-eyes-38-millcity-electric-supply-plans-38-million-facility-port-st-lucie-create-50-job/762486001/|title=Port St. Lucie eyes $38 million City Electric Supply facility, 50 new jobs|work=TCPalm|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en}}</ref> Construction of the TAMCO facility began in 2018 and was completed in late 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tcpalm.com/story/specialty-publications/your-news/st-lucie-county/reader-submitted/2018/09/21/tamco-group-groundbreaking-lights-way-tradition-center-commerce/1384635002/|title=TAMCO Group groundbreaking lights way for Tradition Center for Commerce|work=TCPalm|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en}}</ref>
