'''Porto Velho''' ({{IPA|pt|ˈpoʁtu ˈvɛʎu}}, ''Old Port'') is the [[capital (political)|capital]] of the [[Brazil]]ian [[States of Brazil|state]] of [[Rondônia]], in the upper [[Amazon River]] basin. The population is 514,873 inhabitants (as of the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] 2024 estimation). Located on the [[border]] of Rondônia and the state of [[Amazonas State, Brazil|Amazonas]], the town is an important trading center for [[cassiterite]], the mining of which represents the most important economic activity in the [[region]], as well as a transportation and communication center. It is on the eastern shore of the [[Madeira River]], one of the main [[tributary|tributaries]] of the [[Amazon River]]. It is also Rondônia's largest city, and the largest state capital of Brazil by area.

The municipality occupies most of the border between Amazonas and Rondônia, and is both the westernmost and northernmost city in the state.

== History ==
[[File:Barbadian workers.jpg|thumb|left|260px|This photograph shows an American laundry boss and his "Barbadian" workers, a term used generally to refer to Caribbean immigrants. The laundry in Porto Velho had a steam press, regarded as something of a luxury at the time.]]
Officially founded on October 2, 1914, Porto Velho was founded by pioneers around 1907, during the construction of the [[Madeira-Mamoré Railroad|Madeira-Mamoré railroad]]. After the [[railroad]] was completed, the local population was about one thousand inhabitants; its buildings were chiefly the railway's installations and the wooden houses of the [[Caribbean]] (mainly [[Barbadian people|Barbadian]]) workers - hence the name of the town's largest district by then, "Bajan Hill" or "Barbados Town", nowadays called the "Alto do Bode".

During the first sixty years, the city's [[Urban planning|development]] was directly connected to the railway's activities. The town prospered during the [[Natural rubber|rubber]] boom; after the discovery of cheap [[Malaysia]]n rubber made that of the Amazon obsolete, the region's rubber-centered [[Economics|economy]] ground to a sudden halt. Cities like [[Santo Antônio do Madeira]], which had a [[tram]] line and a weekly [[newspaper]] by the time of Porto Velho's foundation, are still nothing but ruins to this day.

Porto Velho's survival is associated with the better conditions of the area where it was built, its easy access by the river and its harbor: these were all considerations in the choice of Porto Velho as the capital of the newly formed Federal [[Territory (country subdivision)|Territory]] of Guaporé, in 1943. Only with the beginning of [[World War II]] was there another cycle of progress in the region. Once the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] lost control of Malaysian rubber, the Amazon's was needed again due to the [[war effort]]. This produced what is known in Brazil as the "second [[rubber boom]]". Subsequently, when the war ended, the region's economy once again came to a halt.

Porto Velho's modern [[history]] begins with the discovery of [[cassiterite]] around the city, and of [[gold]] on the [[Madeira River]], at the end of the 1950s. In addition, the government's decision to allow large cattle farms in the territory began a trend of migration into the city. Almost one million people moved to Rondônia, and Porto Velho's population increased to three hundred thousand. This intense migration caused much trouble for the city. Among many other problems, the suburban boroughs, for example, were nothing but [[shanty town]]s.{{Vague|date=March 2009}}

The [[Sacred Heart of Jesus Cathedral, Porto Velho|Catedral Metropolitana Sagrado Coração de Jesus]] is the [[cathedral]] [[archiepiscopal]] [[Holy See|see]] of a Latin Catholic jurisdiction that started on May 1, 1925. The vast [[Territorial Prelature of Porto Velho]] split off from the then-[[Diocese of Amazonas]] and [[Diocese of São Luíz de Cáceres]], and also lost parts to three new [[Territorial prelature]]s, before being promoted as the first bishopric (Diocese of Porto Velho). On October 4, 1982, it was promoted as Metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Porto Velho]].{{clarify|date=June 2023}}
