==Name==
[[File:Valvasor_1689_Ljubljana_lintvern.jpg|thumb|Depiction of the city's coat of arms featuring the [[Saint George and the Dragon|dragon]] on top of the [[Ljubljana Castle|castle]], from [[Valvasor]]'s ''[[The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola]]'', 1689]]
The exact origin of the name ''Ljubljana'' is unclear. In [[Middle Ages|medieval times]], both the river and the town were also called ''Laibach'' ({{IPA|de|ˈlaɪ̯bax|lang|audio=De-Laibach.ogg}}) in German. This name was used within the region until 1918 and continues to be used in German. In Italian, the city is referred to as ''[[:it:Lubiana|Lubiana]]'', and in [[Latin]], it is known as ''Labacum''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Libri Antichi Libri Rari |title=Città di stampa dei LIBRI ANTICHI dei LIBRI VECCHI dei LIBRI RARI |url=http://www.osservatoriolibri.com/luoghi.html |access-date=10 December 2011 |publisher=Osservatoriolibri.com |archive-date=2 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202031750/http://www.osservatoriolibri.com/luoghi.html |url-status=live }}</ref><!-- Please maintain the naming conventions [[Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_(geographic_names)#Alternative_names]] by adding alternative English or unofficial foreign names here--> 

The German name was first documented in 1144, and the Slovenian form appeared in records as early as 1146. The 10th-century work "Life of Gregentios" provides the Greek variant Λυπλιανές (''Lyplianes'') and situates it among the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] in the 6th century. This account is influenced by an earlier northern Italian source written shortly after the [[Siege of Pavia (773–774)|conquest of 774]].<ref>{{citation |title=Life and Works of Saint Gregentios, Archbishop of Taphar: Introduction, Critical Edition and Translation |year=2006 |editor=Albrecht Berger |publisher=De Gruyter}}, pp. 14–17 and 190.</ref>

The connection between the Slovene and German names has posed a puzzle for scholars. In 2007, linguist [[Tijmen Pronk]], an authority in comparative Indo-European linguistics and Slovene dialectology from the [[University of Leiden]], provided strong support for the theory that the Slavic ''ljub-'' 'to love, like' was the most likely origin. He argued that the river's name likely stemmed from the settlement's name.<ref>{{cite web |year=2009 |title=Dr T.C.

This can be traced back to the Old Slavic male name ''Ljubovid'', which translates to 'the one with a lovely appearance'. Torkar also asserted that the name ''Laibach'' is a combination of German and Slovene, sharing its origins with the same personal name.<ref>{{cite web |date=6 May 2011 |title=Dr. Silvo Torkar |url=http://isjfr.zrc-sazu.si/sl/sodelavci/silvo-torkar-sl#page-title |access-date=24 April 2012 |publisher=Fran Ramovš Institute of the Slovenian Language |language=sl |archive-date=1 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101054949/http://isjfr.zrc-sazu.si/sl/sodelavci/silvo-torkar-sl#page-title |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Pronk |first=Tijmen |title=O neprepoznanih ali napačno prepoznanih slovanskih antroponimih v slovenskih zemljepisnih imenih: Čadrg, Litija, Trebija, Ljubija, Ljubljana, Biljana |trans-title=On the unrecognized or incorrectly recognized Slavic anthroponyms in Slovenian toponyms: Čadrg, Litija, Trebija, Ljubija, Ljubljana, Biljana |url=http://www.ljubljana.si/file/32485/ljubljana_l13_st_08-09_2008.pdf |journal=The Etymology of Ljubljana – Laibach |language=sl |pages=257–273 |issn=1330-0695 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823142818/http://www.ljubljana.si/file/32485/ljubljana_l13_st_08-09_2008.pdf |archive-date=23 August 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Dragon symbol==
The city's symbol is the [[Ljubljana Dragon]]. It is depicted on the top of the tower of [[Ljubljana Castle]] in the Ljubljana coat of arms and on the Ljubljanica-crossing [[Dragon Bridge (Ljubljana)|Dragon Bridge]] ({{lang|sl|Zmajski most}}).<ref name="ARCH1242">{{cite book |author=C Abdunur |title=ARCH'01: Troisième conferénce internationale sur les ponts en arc |publisher=Presses des Ponts |year=2001 |isbn=978-2-85978-347-1 |page=124}}</ref> It represents power, courage, and greatness.

Several explanations describe the origin of the Ljubljana Dragon. According to a [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]] myth, the slaying of a dragon releases the waters and ensures the fertility of the earth, and it is thought that the myth is tied to the [[Ljubljana Marsh]], the expansive marshy area that periodically threatens Ljubljana with flooding.<ref name="Exhib_20102">[http://www.mgml.si/media/katalog_9_5.pdf Exhibition catalogue Emona: myth and reality] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105154411/http://www.mgml.si/media/katalog_9_5.pdf |date=5 November 2013}}; Museum and Galleries of Ljubljana 2010</ref> According to [[Greek mythology|Greek legend]], the [[Argonauts]] on their return home after having taken the [[Golden Fleece]] found a large lake surrounded by a marsh between the present-day towns of [[Vrhnika]] and Ljubljana. There [[Jason]] struck down a monster. This monster evolved into the [[dragon]] that today is present in the city coat of arms and flag.<ref name="InfoDragon2">{{cite web |title=The dragon – city emblem |url=http://www.ljubljana.si/en/about-ljubljana/images-of-ljubljana/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907174416/http://www.ljubljana.si/en/about-ljubljana/images-of-ljubljana/ |archive-date=7 September 2015 |access-date=2 August 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

It is historically more believable that the dragon was adopted from [[Saint George]], the patron of the Ljubljana Castle chapel built in the 15th century. In the legend of Saint George, the dragon represents the old ancestral [[paganism]] overcome by [[Christianity]]. According to another explanation, related to the second, the dragon was at first only a decoration above the city coat of arms. In the [[Baroque]], it became part of the coat of arms and, in the 19th and especially the 20th century, it outstripped the tower and other elements in importance.

==History==
{{For timeline}}

===Prehistory===
Around 2000 BC, the Ljubljana Marsh was settled by people living in [[Stilt house|pile dwellings]]. [[Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps|Prehistoric pile dwellings]] and [[Ljubljana Marshes Wooden Wheel|the oldest wooden wheel in the world]]<ref>{{cite web |last=novisplet.com |title=Najstarejše kolo z osjo na svetu – 5150 let |url=http://www.ljubljanskobarje.si/unesco-na-ljubljanskem-barju/najstarejse-kolo-z-osjo-na-svetu |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113201447/http://www.ljubljanskobarje.si/unesco-na-ljubljanskem-barju/najstarejse-kolo-z-osjo-na-svetu |archive-date=13 January 2016 |access-date=10 February 2016 |work=ljubljanskobarje.si}}</ref> are among the most notable archeological findings from the marshland.

From 1529, Ljubljana had an active [[Protestant Reformation#Slovene Lands|Slovene Protestant community]]. They were expelled in 1598, marking the beginning of the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Catholic Bishop [[Thomas Chrön]] ordered the public burning of eight cartloads of Protestant books.<ref name="ES2">Rajhman, Jože, & Emilijan Cevc. 1990. Tomaž Hren.

In 1597, the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] arrived, followed in 1606 by the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]], seeking to [[Counter-Reformation|eradicate Protestantism]]. Only 5% of all the residents of Ljubljana at the time were Catholic, but eventually they re-Catholicized the town. The Jesuits staged the first theatre productions, fostered the development of [[Baroque music]], and established Catholic schools. In the middle and the second half of the 17th century, foreign architects built and renovated monasteries, churches, and palaces and introduced [[Baroque architecture]]. In 1702, the [[Ursulines]] settled in the town, and the following year they opened the first public school for girls in the [[Slovene Lands]].

===Central===
The central square in Ljubljana is [[Prešeren Square]] ({{lang|sl|Prešernov trg}}) home to the [[Franciscan Church of the Annunciation]] ({{lang|sl|Frančiškanska cerkev}}). Built between 1646 and 1660 (the bell towers followed), it replaced an older Gothic church. It offers an early-Baroque basilica with one nave and two rows of lateral chapels. The Baroque main altar was executed by sculptor Italian [[Francesco Robba]].

Having already existed in the 18th century, Ljubljana's central square, [[Prešeren Square (Ljubljana)|Prešeren Square]]'s modern appearance has developed since the end of the 19th century. After the 1895 earthquake, [[Max Fabiani]] designed the square as the hub of four streets and four banks, and in the 1980s [[Edvard Ravnikar]] proposed the circular design and the granite block pavement.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ljubljana, Tromostovje |url=http://www.slovenia.info/?arhitekturne_znamenitosti=765&lng=1 |access-date=15 May 2012 |work=slovenia.info |publisher=Slovenian Tourist Board |archive-date=23 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023180508/http://www.slovenia.info/?arhitekturne_znamenitosti=765&lng=1 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Mihelič |first=Breda |year=1999 |title=Prešernov trg v Ljubljani |trans-title=Prešeren Square in Ljubljana |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-YLJCEM5D/ |journal=Zbornik za umetnostno zgodovino [Collection of Art History Papers] |language=sl, en |volume=35 |pages=94–131 |access-date=15 May 2012 |archive-date=13 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200813110613/http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-YLJCEM5D/ |url-status=live }}</ref> A statue of the Slovene [[List of national poets|national poet]] [[France Prešeren]] with a [[muse]] stands in the middle of the square.

[[Congress Square]] ({{lang|sl|Kongresni trg}}) is one of the important centres of the city. It was built in 1821 for ceremonial purposes such as [[Congress of Laibach|Congress of Ljubljana]] after which it was named. Since then it has been a centre for political ceremonies, demonstrations, and protests, such as the ceremony for the creation of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], ceremony of the liberation of [[Belgrade]], and protests against [[JBTZ trial|Yugoslav authority]] in 1988. The square also houses several important buildings, such as the [[University of Ljubljana|University of Ljubljana Palace]], [[Slovenian Philharmonic|Philharmonic Hall]], [[Ursuline Church of the Holy Trinity]], and the [[Slovene Society|Slovene Society Building]]. Star Park ({{lang|sl|Park Zvezda}}) is located in the centre of the square. In 2010 and 2011, the square was renovated and is now mostly closed to road traffic on ground area, however, there are five floors for commercial purposes and a parking lot located underground.<ref>{{cite web |title=Zgodbe, ki so se dogajale na Kongresnem trgu |trans-title=News from Congress Square |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/kultura/drugo/foto-zgodbe-ki-so-se-dogajale-na-kongresnem-trgu/260463 |access-date=9 October 2011 |publisher=Radiotelevizija Slovenija |language=sl |archive-date=7 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907071142/http://www.rtvslo.si/kultura/drugo/foto-zgodbe-ki-so-se-dogajale-na-kongresnem-trgu/260463 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Čop Street]] ({{lang|sl|Čopova ulica}}) is a major thoroughfare in the centre of Ljubljana. The street is named after [[Matija Čop]], an early 19th-century literary figure and close friend of the Slovene [[Romantic poetry|Romantic poet]] [[France Prešeren]]. It leads from the [[Main Post Office Palace (Ljubljana)|Main Post Office]] ({{lang|sl|Glavna pošta}}) at [[Slovene Street (Ljubljana)|Slovene Street]] ({{lang|sl|Slovenska cesta}}) downward to Prešeren Square and is lined with bars and stores, including the oldest [[McDonald's|McDonald's restaurant]] in Slovenia. It is a pedestrian zone and regarded as the capital's central [[promenade]].

==Culture==
===Accent===
The Ljubljana accent and/or dialect ({{langx|sl|ljubljanščina}} {{IPA|sl|luːblɑːŋʃnɑː||lublansna.ogg}}) is considered a border dialect, since Ljubljana is situated where the [[Upper Carniolan dialect group|Upper]] dialect and [[Lower Carniolan dialect group]] meet. Historically,<ref name="Osnove Trubarjevega jezika2">{{cite journal |last1=Rigler |first1=Jakob |date=1965 |title=Osnove Trubarjevega jezika |journal=Jezik in slovstvo |volume=10 |issue=6–7}}</ref> the Ljubljana dialect in the past displayed features more similar with the Lower Carniolan dialect group, but it gradually grew closer to the Upper dialect group, as a direct consequence of mass migration from Upper Carniola into Ljubljana in the 19th and 20th century. Ljubljana as a city grew mostly to the north, and gradually incorporated many villages that were historically part of [[Upper Carniola]] and so its dialect shifted away and closer to the [[Upper Carniolan dialect group|Upper]] dialects. The Ljubljana dialect has also been used as a literary means in novels, such as in the novel ''Nekdo drug'' by [[Branko Gradišnik]],<ref name="Gjurin_Gradisnik2">{{cite web |title=Velemir Gjurin: Beseda avtorju.

The central position of Ljubljana and its dialect had crucial impact<ref name="Osnove Trubarjevega jezika2" /> on the development of the Slovenian language. It was the speech of 16th century Ljubljana that [[Primož Trubar]] a Slovenian [[Protestant Reformers|Protestant Reformer]] took as a foundation of what later became standard [[Slovenian language]], with a small addition of his native speech, the [[Lower Carniolan dialect]].<ref name="Osnove Trubarjevega jezika2" /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rigler |first1=Jakob |date=1965 |title=Nekdanja ljubljanščina kot osnova Trubarjevega jezika |journal=Začetki Slovenskega Knjižnega Jezika |pages=100–110}}</ref> While in Ljubljana, he lived in a house, on today's Ribji trg, in the oldest part of the city. Living in Ljubljana had a profound impact on his work; he considered Ljubljana the capital of all [[Slovenes]], not only because of its central position in the heart of the [[Slovene lands]], but also because it always had an essentially Slovene character. Most of its inhabitants spoke Slovene as their mother tongue, unlike other cites in today's [[Slovenia]]. It is estimated that in Trubar's time around 70% of Ljubljana's 4000 inhabitants attended mass in Slovene.<ref name="Osnove Trubarjevega jezika2" /> Trubar considered Ljubljana's speech most suitable, since it sounded much more noble, than his own simple dialect of his hometown [[Rašica, Velike Lašče|Rašica]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rigler |first1=Jakob |date=1968 |title=Začetki slovenskega knjižnega jezika. The Origins of the Slovene Literary Language, Ljubljana: Slovenska akademija znanosti in umetnosti |journal=Razred Za Filoloske in Literarne Vede |volume=22}}</ref> Trubar's choice was later adopted also by other Protestant writers in the 16th century, and ultimately led to a formation of a more standard language.

===In literary fiction===
Ljubljana appears in the 2005 ''[[The Historian]]'', written by [[Elisabeth Kostova]], and is called by its Roman name (Emona).<ref>''[[The Historian]]'', [http://www.bookbrowse.com/excerpts/index.cfm/book_number/1589/page_number/3/the-historian excerpt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240601004314/https://www.bookbrowse.com/excerpts/index.cfm/book_number/1589/page_number/3/the-historian |date=1 June 2024 }} from the novel, p.3-4</ref>

Ljubljana is also the setting of [[Paulo Coelho]]'s 1998 novel ''[[Veronika Decides to Die]]''.

Ljubljana has numerous [[Art museum|art galleries]] and museums. The first purpose-built art gallery in Ljubljana was the [[Jakopič Pavilion]], which was in the first half of the 20th century the central exhibition venue of Slovene artists. In the early 1960s, it was succeeded by [[Ljubljana City Art Gallery]], which has presented a number of modern Slovene and foreign artists. In 2010, there were 14 museums and 56 art galleries in Ljubljana.<ref name="InNumbers2">{{cite web |title=Ljubljana in Figures |url=http://www.ljubljana.si/en/about-ljubljana/ljubljana-in-numbers/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419120715/http://www.ljubljana.si/en/about-ljubljana/ljubljana-in-numbers |archive-date=19 April 2012 |access-date=23 April 2012 |publisher=City Municipality of Ljubljana |df=dmy-all}}</ref> There is for example an architecture museum, [[Slovenian Railway Museum|a railway museum]], a school museum, a sports museum, a museum of modern art, a museum of contemporary art, a [[Pivovarna Union|brewery museum]], the [[Slovenian Museum of Natural History]] and the Slovene Ethnographic Museum.<ref name="Pointinteret2" /> The [[National Gallery of Slovenia|National Gallery]] ({{lang|sl|Narodna galerija}}), founded in 1918,<ref name="Histo52" /> and the [[Museum of Modern Art (Ljubljana)|Museum of Modern Art]] ({{lang|sl|Moderna galerija}}) exhibit the [[List of Slovenian artists|most influential Slovenian artists]].

[[Cankar Hall]] is the largest Slovenian cultural and congress center with multiple halls and a large foyer in which art film festivals, artistic performances, book fairs, and other cultural events are held.

====Cinema====
The cinema in Ljubljana appeared for the first time at the turn of the 20th century, and quickly gained popularity among the residents. After World War II, the [[Cinema Company Ljubljana]], later named ''Ljubljana Cinematographers'', was established and managed a number of already functioning movie theatres in Ljubljana, including the only Yugoslav children's theatre. Cinema festivals took place in the 1960s, and a [[cinematheque]] opened its doors in 1963. With the advent of television, video, and recently the Internet, most cinema theatres in Ljubljana closed, and the cinema mainly moved to [[Kolosej]], a [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] in the [[BTC City]]. It features twelve screens, including an [[IMAX 3D]] screen. The remaining theatres are [[Kino Komuna]], [[Kinodvor]], where art movies are accompanied by events, and the [[Slovenian Cinematheque]]. The [[Slovenian Cinematheque]] hosts the international [[Ljubljana LGBT Film Festival]] which showcases [[LGBT]]-themed films. Founded in 1984, it is the oldest film festival of its sort in Europe (with oldest ex SFRY LGBT+ march in [[Ljubljana Pride]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=About |url=https://www.lgbtfilmfest.si/en/about |access-date=3 March 2021 |website=36. lgbt film festival |publisher=Društvo ŠKUC |archive-date=12 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210512014644/https://www.lgbtfilmfest.si/en/about |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Classical music, opera and ballet====
The [[Slovenian Philharmonics]] is the central music institution in Ljubljana and Slovenia. It holds [[classical music]] concerts of domestic and foreign performers as well as educates youth. It was established in 1701 as part of [[Academia operosorum Labacensis]] and is among the oldest such institutions in Europe. The [[Slovene National Opera and Ballet Theatre]] also resides in Ljubljana, presenting a wide variety of domestic and foreign, modern and classic, opera, ballet and concert works. It serves as the national opera and ballet house. Music festivals are held in Ljubljana, chiefly in [[Classical music|European classical music]] and jazz, for instance the [[Ljubljana Summer Festival]] ({{lang|sl|Ljubljanski poletni festival}}), and [[Trnfest]].

====Theatre====
In addition to the main houses, with the [[Slovene National Theatre, Ljubljana|SNT Drama Ljubljana]] as the most important among them, a number of small producers are active in Ljubljana, involved primarily in [[physical theatre]] (e.g. [[Betontanc]]), [[street theatre]] (e.g. [[Ana Monró Theatre]]), [[theatresports]] championship [[Impro League]], and [[improvisational theatre]] (e.g. [[IGLU Theatre]]). A popular form is [[puppetry]], mainly performed in the [[Ljubljana Puppet Theatre]]. Theatre has a rich tradition in Ljubljana, starting with the 1867 first ever Slovene-language drama performance.

====Modern dance====
The [[modern dance]] was presented in Ljubljana for the first time at the end of the 19th century and developed rapidly since the end of the 1920s. Since the 1930s when in Ljubljana was founded a [[Mary Wigman]] dance school, the first one for modern dance in Slovenia, the field has been intimately linked to the development in Europe and the United States. [[Ljubljana Dance Theatre]] is today the only venue in Ljubljana dedicated to [[contemporary dance]]. Despite this, there's a vivid happening in the field.

====Folk dance====

==Sports==
===Clubs===
Tension between German and Slovene residents dominated the development of sport in Ljubljana in the 19th century. The first sports club in Ljubljana was the [[South Sokol Gymnastic Club]] ({{lang|sl|Gimnastično društvo Južni Sokol}}), established in 1863 and succeeded in 1868 by the [[Ljubljana Sokol]] ({{lang|sl|Ljubljanski Sokol}}). It was the parent club of all [[Slovene Sokol movement|Slovene Sokol clubs]] as well as an encouragement for the establishment of the [[Croatian Sokol movement|Croatian Sokol club]] in Zagreb. Members were also active in culture and politics, striving for greater integration of the Slovenes from different Crown lands of [[Austria-Hungary]] and for their cultural, political, and economic independence.

In 1885, German residents established the first sports club in the territory of nowadays Slovenia, {{lang|de|[[Der Laibacher Byciklistischer Club]]}} (''Ljubljana Cycling Club''). In 1887, Slovene cyclists established the [[Slovene Cyclists Club]] ({{lang|sl|Slovenski biciklistični klub}}). In 1893 followed the first Slovene [[Alpine club]], named [[Slovene Alpine Club]] ({{lang|sl|Slovensko planinsko društvo}}), later succeeded by the [[Alpine Association of Slovenia]] ({{lang|sl|Planinska zveza Slovenije}}). Several of its branches operate in Ljubljana, the largest of them being the [[Ljubljana Matica Alpine Club]] ({{lang|sl|Planinsko društvo Ljubljana-Matica}}). In 1900, the sports club {{lang|de|Laibacher Sportverein}} (English: ''Ljubljana Sports Club'') was established by the city's German residents and functioned until 1909. In 1906, Slovenes organised themselves in its Slovene counterpart, the Ljubljana Sports Club ({{lang|sl|Ljubljanski športni klub}}). Its members were primarily interested in [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], but also swimming and football. In 1911, the first Slovenian football club, [[ND Ilirija|Ilirija]], started operating in the city. Winter sports already started to develop in the area of the nowadays Ljubljana before World War II.<ref name="SDDolomiti2012-01-052">{{cite web |title=Zgodovina |date=13 October 2011 |trans-title=History |url=http://www.sddolomiti.si/?page_id=172 |access-date=5 January 2012 |publisher=Sports Club Dolomiti |archive-date=7 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507095503/http://www.sddolomiti.si/?page_id=172 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1929, the first [[ice hockey]] club in Slovenia (then Yugoslavia), [[HDD Olimpija Ljubljana|SK Ilirija]], was established.

==Education==
===Primary education===
In Ljubljana today there are over 50 public elementary schools with over 20,000 pupils.<ref name="InNumbers2" /><ref name="University of Ljubljana2">{{cite web |last=University of Ljubljana |year=2011 |title=University of Ljubljana |url=http://www.uni-lj.si/en/about_university_of_ljubljana/university_of_ljubljana.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923195525/http://www.uni-lj.si/en/about_university_of_ljubljana/university_of_ljubljana.aspx |archive-date=23 September 2011 |access-date=5 July 2011 |work=uni-lj.si}}</ref> This also includes an [[International school|international]] elementary school for foreign pupils. There are two private elementary schools: a [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]] elementary school and a [[Catholic school|Catholic]] elementary school. In addition, there are several elementary music schools.

Historically the first school in Ljubljana belonged to [[Teutonic Knights]] and was established in the 13th century. It originally accepted only boys; girls were accepted from the beginning of the 16th century. [[Parochial school|Parochial schools]] are attested in the 13th century, at [[St. Peter's Parish Church (Ljubljana)|St. Peter's Church]] and at Saint Nicholas's Church, the later Ljubljana Cathedral. Since 1291, there were also trade-oriented private schools in Ljubljana. At the beginning of the 17th century, there were six schools in Ljubljana and later three. A girls' school was established by [[Poor Clares]], followed in 1703 by the [[Ursulines]]. Their school was for about 170 years the only public girls' school in [[Carniola]]. These schools were mainly private or established by the city.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rudolf |first=Dostal |year=1939 |title=Ljubljansko ljudsko šolstvo v terezijanski in jožefinski dobi |language=sl |trans-title=Ljubljana People's Schools in the Era of Theresian and Josef's Era |volume=6 |pages=21–28; 33–41 |journal=Kronika slovenskih mest [The Chronicle of Slovenian Cities] |publisher=City Municipality of Ljubljana |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-5MPOYPTA/ |access-date=9 May 2012 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304231239/http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-5MPOYPTA/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1775, the Austrian Empress [[Maria Theresa]] proclaimed [[elementary education]] obligatory and Ljubljana got its [[Normal school#Europe|normal school]], intended as a learning place for teachers. In 1805, the first state [[music school]] was established in Ljubljana. In the time of [[Illyrian Provinces]], "''école primaire''", a unified four-year elementary school program with a greater emphasis on Slovene, was introduced. The first public schools, unrelated to religious education, appeared in 1868.

===Secondary education===
[[File:Realka-Ljubljana.JPG|left|thumb|The first complete ''Realschule'' (technical grammar school) was established in Ljubljana in 1871.]]
In Ljubljana, there are ten public and three private [[Grammar school|grammar schools]]. The public schools are divided into general [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]] and [[Classical gymnasium|classical]] gymnasiums, the latter offering Latin and Greek as foreign languages. Some general schools offer internationally oriented European departments, and some offer sports departments, allowing students to more easily adjust their sport and school obligations. All state schools are free, but the number of students they can accept is limited. The private secondary schools include a Catholic grammar school and a Waldorf grammar school. There are also professional grammar schools in Ljubljana, offering economical, technical, or artistic subjects (visual arts, music). All grammar schools last four years and conclude with the ''[[matura]]'' exam.

Historically, upon a proposal by [[Primož Trubar]], the [[Carniolan Estates' School]] (1563–1598) was established in 1563 in the period of [[Slovene Reformation]]. Its teaching languages were mainly [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], but also [[German language|German]] and [[Slovene language|Slovene]], and it was open for both sexes and all social strata. In 1597, [[Jesuit|Jesuits]] established the [[Laibach Jesuit College|Jesuit College]] (1597–1773), intended to transmit general education. In 1773, secondary education came under the control of the state. A number of reforms were implemented in the 19th century; there was more emphasis on general knowledge and religious education was removed from state secondary schools. In 1910, there were 29 secondary schools in Ljubljana, among them classical and real gymnasiums and [[Realschule|Realschules]] (technical secondary schools).

Historically, higher schools offering the study of general medicine, surgery, architecture, law and theology, started to operate in Ljubljana under the [[Illyrian Provinces|French annexation of Slovene territory]], in 1810–1811. The Austro-Hungarian Empire never allowed Slovenes to establish their own university in Ljubljana, and the [[University of Ljubljana]], Slovenia's most important university, was founded in 1919 after Slovenes joined the first Yugoslavia.<ref name="Histo52" /><ref name="University of Ljubljana2" /> When it was founded, the university comprised five faculties: law, philosophy, technology, theology and medicine. From the beginning, the seat of the university has been at [[Congress Square]] in a building that served as the State Mansion of Carniola from 1902 to 1918.

; History

The first libraries in Ljubljana were located in [[Monastery|monasteries]]. The first public library was the [[Carniolan Estates' Library]], established in&nbsp;1569 by Primož Trubar. In the 17th century, the [[Jesuit library, Ljubljana|Jesuit Library]] collected numerous works, particularly about mathematics. In&nbsp;1707, the [[Seminary Library, Ljubljana|Seminary Library]] was established; it is the first and oldest public scientific library in Slovenia. Around&nbsp;1774, after the dissolution of the Jesuits, the [[Lyceum Library, Ljubljana|Lyceum Library]] was formed from the remains of the Jesuit Library as well as several monastery libraries.

==Science==
The first society of the leading scientists and public workers in Carniola was the [[Dismas Fraternity]] (Latin: {{lang|la|Societas Unitorum}}), formed in Ljubljana in 1688.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lavric AHAS 6 &#124; Umetnostnozgodovinski inštitut Franceta Steleta |url=http://umzg.zrc-sazu.si/?q=%2Fnode%2F264 |access-date=1 June 2011 |publisher=Umzg.zrc-sazu.si |archive-date=31 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831211327/http://umzg.zrc-sazu.si/?q=%2Fnode%2F264 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1693, the ''[[Academia Operosorum Labacensium]]'' was founded and lasted with an interruption until the end of the 18th century. The next academy in Ljubljana, the [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts]], was not established until 1938.

It can carry up to five passengers; most of them are elderly people and tourists.<ref>{{cite web |date=30 March 2011 |title='The Cavalier' on the Streets of Ljubljana |url=http://www.ljubljana.si/en/municipality/news/71679/detail.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910000733/http://www.ljubljana.si/en/municipality/news/71679/detail.html |archive-date=10 September 2011 |access-date=24 April 2012 |work=Ljubljana.si |publisher=City Municipality of Ljubljana |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Cavalier drives in the [[car-free zone]] in the Ljubljana downtown.

===Bicycles===
[[File:BicikeLJ_Ljubljana-Prešernov_trg.JPG|thumb|[[BicikeLJ]], a Ljubljana-based self-service bicycle network, is free of charge for the first hour.]]
There is a considerable amount of [[bicycle]] traffic in Ljubljana, especially in the warmer months of the year. It is also possible to rent a bike. Since May 2011, the [[BicikeLJ]], a self-service [[Bicycle sharing system|bicycle rental]] system offers the residents and visitors of Ljubljana 600 bicycles and more than 600 parking spots at 60 stations in the wider city centre area. The daily number of rentals is around 2,500.<ref>{{cite web |date=24 July 2011 |title=Ljubljana Rent-a-Bike Network Gaining in Popularity |url=http://www.sta.si/vest.php?s=a&id=1659068 |publisher=STA |access-date=25 July 2011 |archive-date=12 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112175559/http://www.sta.si/vest.php?s=a&id=1659068 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=14 May 2011 |title=Ljubljana Launches Public Bike Project |url=http://www.sta.si/en/vest.php?id=1635721 |publisher=STA |access-date=25 July 2011 |archive-date=12 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112175546/http://www.sta.si/en/vest.php?id=1635721 |url-status=live }}</ref> There was an option to rent a bike even before the establishment of BicikeLJ.<ref name="Transvelo2">{{cite web |title=Ljubljana Bike |url=http://www.ljubljana.si/en/tourist_services/lj-bike/default.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009205059/http://www.ljubljana.si/en/tourist_services/lj-bike/default.html |archive-date=9 October 2007 |access-date=31 July 2008}}</ref>

There are still some conditions for cyclists in Ljubljana that have been criticised, including cycle lanes in poor condition and constructed in a way that motorised traffic is privileged. There are also many one-way streets which therefore cannot be used as alternate routes so it is difficult to legally travel by bicycle through the city centre.<ref>{{cite web |author=Mateja Gruden |date=25 March 2012 |title=Delo (17. julij 2000): Razvajati kolesarje, ne avtomobiliste |url=http://www.delo.si/novice/slovenija/razvajati-kolesarje-ne-avtomobiliste.html/ |access-date=24 August 2012 |publisher=delo.si |archive-date=28 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328131646/http://delo.si/novice/slovenija/razvajati-kolesarje-ne-avtomobiliste.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Ljubljanska kolesarska mreža |date=12 June 2012 |title=Peticija za Fabianijev most |url=http://kolesarji.org/peticija-za-fabianijev-most/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824211642/https://kolesarji.org/peticija-za-fabianijev-most/ |archive-date=24 August 2012 |access-date=24 August 2012 |publisher=kolesarji.org}}</ref> Through years, some prohibitions have been partially abolished by marking [[Cycle lane|cycle lanes]] on the pavement.<ref>{{cite web |date=9 January 2008 |title=Mladina (17. julij 2000): Kolesarski zmaji |url=http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200029/clanek/i-kuscer/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010504065527/http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200029/clanek/i-kuscer/ |archive-date=4 May 2001 |access-date=10 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Ljubljanska kolesarska mreža (okt. 2010): Pobude za izboljšave v Ljubljanski kolesarski infrastrukturi, str. 2 |url=http://lkm.kolesarji.org/besedila/LKM%20pobude%20za%20prijazno%20kolesarsko%20infrastrukturo.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820050256/http://lkm.kolesarji.org/besedila/LKM%20pobude%20za%20prijazno%20kolesarsko%20infrastrukturo.pdf |archive-date=20 August 2011 |access-date=10 December 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Nevertheless, the situation has been steadily improving; in 2015, Ljubljana placed 13th in a ranking of the world's most bicycle-friendly cities.<ref>{{cite web |date=30 June 2015 |title=Survey Ranks Ljubljana World's 13th Most Bicycle-Friendly City |url=http://www.sloveniatimes.com/survey-ranks-ljubljana-world-s-13th-most-bicycle-friendly-city |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703065353/http://www.sloveniatimes.com/survey-ranks-ljubljana-world-s-13th-most-bicycle-friendly-city |archive-date=3 July 2015 |access-date=30 June 2015 |work=Slovenia Times}}</ref> In 2016, Ljubljana was 8th on the Copenhagenize list.<ref>{{cite web |date=21 June 2018 |title=copenhagenizeindex |url=http://copenhagenizeindex.eu/08_ljubljana.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180716072259/http://copenhagenizeindex.eu/08_ljubljana.html |archive-date=16 July 2018 |access-date=21 June 2018 |publisher=copenhagenizeindex.eu}}</ref>

===Water transport===
The river transport on the Ljubljanica and the Sava was the main means of cargo transport to and from the city until the mid-19th century, when railroads were built. Today, the Ljubljanica is used by a number of tourist boats, with wharves under the [[Butchers' Bridge]], at [[Fish Square, Ljubljana|Fish Square]], at [[Court Square, Ljubljana|Court Square]], at [[Breg, Ljubljana|Breg]], at the [[Poljane Embankment]], and elsewhere.

==Healthcare==
Ljubljana has a rich history of discoveries in medicine and innovations in medical technology. The majority of [[Secondary care|secondary]] and [[tertiary care]] in Slovenia takes place in Ljubljana.

The [[Faculty of Medicine, Ljubljana|Faculty of Medicine]] (University of Ljubljana) and the [[Ljubljana Institute of Oncology]] are the other two central medical institutions in Slovenia. The [[Ljubljana Community Health Centre]] is the largest [[health centre]] in Slovenia. It has seven units at 11 locations.
