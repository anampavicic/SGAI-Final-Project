'''Sheffield''' is a [[city status in the United Kingdom|city]]{{Efn|The area that is the subject of this article does not have legal city status of itself, but is widely regarded as a city since it is the main and nominate settlement in the City of Sheffield local government area.}} in [[South Yorkshire]], England,  situated {{convert|29|mi|adj=off}} south of [[Leeds]] and {{convert|32|mi|adj=off}} east of [[Manchester]]. Its name derives from the [[River Sheaf]] which runs through it. The city serves as the administrative centre of the [[City of Sheffield]]. It is [[Historic counties of England|historically]] part of the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] and some of its southern suburbs were transferred from [[Derbyshire]] to the city council. It is the largest settlement in South Yorkshire.<ref>{{cite news |last1= |first1= |title=Here's Yorkshire in a Nutshell |url=https://yorkshiretimes.co.uk/facts.php |access-date=30 December 2021 |work=Yorkshire Times |archive-date=30 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211230170242/https://yorkshiretimes.co.uk/facts.php |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Most populated districts in Yorkshire {{!}} Yorkshire guide gazetteer of cities, towns and villages |url=https://yorkshire.guide/content.pl?action=populations |website=yorkshire.guide |access-date=30 December 2021 |archive-date=30 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211230170242/https://yorkshire.guide/content.pl?action=populations |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Yorkshire Facts and Statistics |url=https://www.yorkshirenetwork.co.uk/yorkshire/yorkshire-facts-and-statistics/ |website=Yorkshire Enterprise Network |access-date=30 December 2021 |archive-date=30 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211230170243/https://www.yorkshirenetwork.co.uk/yorkshire/yorkshire-facts-and-statistics/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Sheffield played a crucial role in the [[Industrial Revolution]], with many significant inventions and technologies having developed in the city. In the 19th century, the city saw a huge expansion of its traditional cutlery trade, when [[stainless steel]] and [[crucible steel]] were developed locally, fuelling an almost tenfold increase in the population. Sheffield received its [[municipal charter]] in 1843, becoming the City of Sheffield in 1893. International competition in iron and steel caused a decline in these industries in the 1970s and 1980s, coinciding with the collapse of coal mining in the area. The Yorkshire [[riding (division)|ridings]] became counties in their own right in 1889, the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] county was disbanded in 1974. The city then became part of the county of [[South Yorkshire]]; this has been made up of separately-governed [[unitary authorities]] since 1986. The 21st century has seen extensive [[Urban renewal|redevelopment]] in Sheffield, consistent with other British cities. Sheffield's [[gross value added]] (GVA) has increased by 60% since 1997, standing at £11.3&nbsp;billion in 2015. The economy has experienced steady growth, averaging around 5% annually, which is greater than that of the broader region of Yorkshire and the Humber.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/your-city-council/sheffield-facts-figures/sheffield-economy/income--wealth |title=Income & Wealth |date=30 November 2007 |publisher=[[Sheffield City Council]] |access-date=7 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521085049/http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/your-city-council/sheffield-facts-figures/sheffield-economy/income--wealth |archive-date=21 May 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Sheffield had a population of 556,500 at the 2021 census, making it the second largest city in the [[Yorkshire and the Humber]] region. The [[Sheffield Urban Area|Sheffield Built-up Area]], of which the Sheffield sub-division is the largest part, had a population of 685,369 also including the town of [[Rotherham]]. The [[City of Sheffield|district borough]], governed from the city, had a population of {{English district population|GSS=E08000019}} at the mid-2019 estimate, making it the [[List of English districts by population|{{English district rank|GSS= E08000019}}]] most populous district in England. It is one of eleven British cities that make up the [[Core Cities Group]].<ref>{{cite news |title=What is Core Cities UK? |url=https://www.corecities.com/about-us/what-core-cities-uk |access-date=9 August 2022 |website=CoreCities.com |archive-date=9 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220809133235/https://www.corecities.com/about-us/what-core-cities-uk |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2011, the unparished area had a population of 490,070.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/yorkshireandthehumber/admin/sheffield/E43000173__sheffield/ |title=Sheffield |publisher=City Population |access-date=12 May 2022 |archive-date=25 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210725162107/https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/yorkshireandthehumber/admin/sheffield/E43000173__sheffield/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The city has a long sporting heritage and is home both to the world's oldest football club, [[Sheffield F.C.]],<ref name="celebration">{{cite news |title=Pelé joins Sheffield celebrations |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7081034.stm |agency=BBC |date=24 June 2015 |work=BBC News |first=Jonathan |last=Rawcliffe |access-date=24 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112151430/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7081034.stm |archive-date=12 January 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> and the world's oldest football ground, [[Sandygate (stadium)|Sandygate]]. Matches between the two professional clubs, [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], are known as the [[Steel City derby]]. The city is also home to the [[World Snooker Championship]] and the [[Sheffield Steelers]], the UK's first professional ice hockey team.

==Etymology==
The name ''Sheffield'', has its origins in [[Old English]] and derives from the name of a principal river in the city, the [[River Sheaf]]. This name, in turn, is a corruption of ''shed'' or ''sheth'', which refers to a ''divide'' or ''separation''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Goodall |first=Armitage&nbsp;C. |title=Place-Names of South-West Yorkshire; that is, of so much of the West Riding as lies south of the Aire from Keighley onwards |year=1913 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924028042962 |pages=253–254}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Addy |first=Sidney Oldall |author-link=Sidney Oldall Addy |title=A Glossary of Words Used in the Neighbourhood of Sheffield.

===Early history===
[[File:Ruins of Sheffield Manor 1819 1.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Lithograph drawing showing a large stately home in ruins|[[Sheffield Manor]] ruins as they appeared {{circa|1819}}]]
The area now occupied by the City of Sheffield is believed to have been inhabited since at least the late [[Upper Paleolithic]], about 12,800 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pike |first1=Alistair W.&nbsp;G. |last2=Gilmour |first2=Mabs |last3=Pettitt |first3=Paul |last4=Jacobid |first4=Roger |last5=Ripoll |first5=Sergio |last6=Bahn |first6=Paul |last7=Muñoz |first7=Francisco |year=2005 |title=Verification of the age of the Palaeolithic cave art at Creswell Crags, UK |journal=Journal of Archaeological Science |volume=32 |issue=11 |pages=1649–1655 |doi=10.1016/j.jas.2005.05.002|bibcode=2005JArSc..32.1649P }}</ref> The earliest evidence of human occupation in the Sheffield area was found at [[Creswell Crags]] to the east of the city. In the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] the area became the southernmost territory of the [[Pennines|Pennine]] tribe called the [[Brigantes]]. It is this tribe who are thought to have constructed several hill forts in and around Sheffield.<ref name=VICKERS />

Following the departure of the Romans, the Sheffield area may have been the southern part of the [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic]] kingdom of [[Elmet]], with the rivers Sheaf and Don forming part of the boundary between this kingdom and the kingdom of [[Mercia]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cox |first=Tony |year=2003 |title=The Ancient Kingdom of Elmet |journal=The Barwicker |volume=39 |page=43 |url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/FeaturesBritain/BritishElmet.htm |access-date=17 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001181311/http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/FeaturesBritain/BritishElmet.htm |archive-date=1 October 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref> Gradually, [[Angles (tribe)|Anglian]] settlers pushed west from the kingdom of [[Deira]]. A Britonnic presence within the Sheffield area is evidenced by two settlements called [[Wales, South Yorkshire|Wales]] and Waleswood close to Sheffield.<ref>The word ''Wales'' derives from the Germanic word ''[[Walhaz]]'', and was originally used by the Anglo-Saxons to refer to the native Britons. In reference to the villages of Wales and Waleswood, [[Sidney Oldall Addy|S.O. Addy]], in his ''A Glossary of Words Used in the Neighbourhood of Sheffield'', p. 274, states "The Anglo-Saxon invaders or settlers called the old inhabitants or aborigines of this country wealas, or foreigners."

Large parts of the city centre were also cleared to make way for a new system of roads.<ref name="VICKERS"/> In February 1962, the city was devastated by the [[Great Sheffield Gale]]; winds of up to {{cvt|97|mph|kph}} killed four people and damaged 150,000 houses, more than two-thirds of the city's housing stock at the time.<ref name="rmets">{{cite web |last1=Eden |first1=Philip |title=The Sheffield Gale of 1962 |url=https://www.rmets.org/sites/default/files/hisnews1201.pdf |website=Royal Meteorological Society |access-date=1 February 2022 |archive-date=21 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220121220023/https://www.rmets.org/sites/default/files/hisnews1201.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> Increased automation and competition from abroad resulted in the [[steel crisis|closure of many steel mills]].

===21st century===
Sheffield is changing rapidly as new projects regenerate some of the more run-down parts of the city. One such, the ''Heart of the City Project'', has initiated a number of public works in the city centre: the [[Peace Gardens]] were renovated in 1998, the [[Millennium Galleries]] opened in April 2001, the [[Sheffield Winter Gardens|Winter Gardens]] were opened in May 2003, and a public space to link these two areas, the [[Millennium Square (Sheffield)|Millennium Square]], was opened in May 2006.

Sheffield was particularly hard hit during the [[2007 United Kingdom floods]] and the [[Winter of 2009-2010 in the United Kingdom|2010 'Big Freeze']]. Many landmark buildings such as Meadowhall and the [[Hillsborough Stadium]] flooded due to being close to rivers that flow through the city. In 2010, 5,000 properties in Sheffield were identified as still being at risk of flooding. In 2012 the city narrowly escaped another flood, despite extensive work by the Environment Agency to clear local river channels since the 2007 event. In 2014 Sheffield Council's cabinet approved plans to further reduce the possibility of flooding by adopting plans to increase water catchment on tributaries of the River Don.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-29245851 |title=£55m flood scheme plans backed |date=17 September 2014 |work=BBC News |access-date=2 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190106214822/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-29245851 |archive-date=6 January 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.floodprotectionsheffield.com/pages/foreword |title=Foreword {{!}} Protecting Sheffield from Flooding |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190103055647/http://www.floodprotectionsheffield.com/pages/foreword |archive-date=3 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/289379/River_Don_Catchment_Flood_Management_Plan.pdf |title=River Don Catchment Flood Management Plan |date=December 2010 |website=assets.publishing.service.gov.uk |access-date=2 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190103004919/https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/289379/River_Don_Catchment_Flood_Management_Plan.pdf |archive-date=3 January 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[2019–20 United Kingdom floods#Sheffield|Another flood hit the city in 2019]], resulting in shoppers being contained in Meadowhall Shopping Centre.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sheffield flooding: Torrential rain leaves city flooded |work=BBC News |date=8 November 2019 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-50333233 |access-date=12 July 2020 |archive-date=28 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201128084103/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-50333233 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Gillett |first1=Francesca |title=UK flooding: Dozens spend night in Sheffield Meadowhall shopping centre |work=BBC News |date=8 November 2019 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50341846 |access-date=12 July 2020 |archive-date=8 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108232639/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50341846 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Between 2014 and 2018, there were [[Sheffield tree felling protests|disputes]] between the city council and residents over the fate of the city's 36,000 highway trees.

==Governance==
{{See also|Sheffield City Council elections}}

===Local authority===
[[File:Sheffield-town-hall-staircase.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Sheffield Town Hall|The staircase at Sheffield Town Hall]]
Sheffield is governed at the local level by [[Sheffield City Council]] and is led by Councillor Tom Hunt (Assumed office
16 May 2023).<ref>{{cite news |last=Wright |first=Oliver |date=17 May 2023 |title=Sheffield City Council: Labour's Tom Hunt elected as new leader |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-65621912 |access-date=5 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230518203759/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-65621912 |archive-date=18 May 2023}}</ref> It consists of 84&nbsp;councillors elected to represent 28&nbsp;[[Ward (electoral subdivision)|wards]]: three councillors per ward. Following the [[2024 Sheffield City Council election|2024 local elections]], the distribution of council seats is [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] 36, [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] 27, the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] 14, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] 0 and [[Independent politician|Independent]] 7. The city also has a [[List of mayors of Sheffield|Lord Mayor]]; though now simply a ceremonial position, in the past the office carried considerable authority, with executive powers over the finances and affairs of the city council. The position of Lord Mayor is elected on an annual basis.

For much of its history the council was controlled by the Labour Party, and was noted for its [[left-wing politics|leftist]] sympathies; during the 1980s, when Sheffield City Council was led by [[David Blunkett]], the area gained the epithet the "[[People's Republic of South Yorkshire|Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire]]".<ref>{{cite book |last=Price |first=David |title=Sheffield Troublemakers: Rebels and Radicals in Sheffield History |publisher=Phillimore & Co.

The majority of council-owned facilities are operated by independent charitable trusts. [[Sheffield International Venues]] runs many of the city's sporting and leisure facilities, including [[Sheffield Arena]] and the [[English Institute of Sport, Sheffield]]. [[Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust|Museums Sheffield]] and the [[Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust]] take care of galleries and museums owned by the council.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museums-sheffield.org.uk/coresite/html/background.asp |title=Introducing Museums Sheffield |work=Museums Sheffield website |publisher=Sheffield Galleries & Museums Trust |access-date=21 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621014917/http://www.museums-sheffield.org.uk/coresite/html/background.asp |archive-date=21 June 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.simt.co.uk/about |title=About SIMT |work=Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust website |publisher=Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust |access-date=15 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814134606/http://www.simt.co.uk/about |archive-date=14 August 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Combined authority===
{{main|South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority}}
The city of Sheffield is part of the wider [[South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority]], headed by mayor [[Oliver Coppard]] since 2022. The [[combined authority]] covers the former 1974–1986 [[South Yorkshire County Council]] area which functions either went to local or regional authorities.

In 2004, as part of the ''Moving Forward: [[The Northern Way]]'' document,<ref name="Moving Forward:The Northern Way">{{cite web |url=http://www.thenorthernway.co.uk/trackdoc.asp?id=19&pId=55 |title=Moving Forward:The Northern Way |access-date=24 September 2017}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> city regions were created in a collaboration with the three northern [[Regional development agency|regional development agencies]]. These became independent [[Local enterprise partnership]]s in 2011.

The area's partnership retains the Sheffield City Region name, covering the South Yorkshire authorities, as well as [[Bolsover District]], [[Borough of Chesterfield]], [[Derbyshire Dales]], [[North East Derbyshire]] and [[Bassetlaw District]]. In 2014, the ''Sheffield City Region Combined authority'' was formed by the South Yorkshire [[Local government|local authorities]] with the other councils as non-constituent members and the partnership integrated with the authority structure. In September 2020, the authority changed to its current name.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sheffieldcityregion.org.uk/about-us-governance-policy/who-we-are/ |title=It's fun to become the YMCA! |publisher=sheffieldcityregion.org.uk |access-date=18 September 2020 |archive-date=23 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200923103343/https://sheffieldcityregion.org.uk/about-us-governance-policy/who-we-are/ |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The present city boundaries were set in 1974 (with slight modification in 1994), when the former [[county borough]] of Sheffield merged with [[Stocksbridge]] [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|Urban District]] and two parishes from the [[Wortley Rural District]].<ref name="sheffgeog" /> This area includes a significant part of the countryside surrounding the main urban region.

===Climate===
According to the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen classification]], Sheffield has a [[Temperate climate|temperate]] [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'') like the rest of the United Kingdom. The uplands of the [[Pennines]] to the west can create a cool, gloomy and wet environment, but they also provide shelter from the prevailing westerly winds, casting a "[[rain shadow]]" across the area.<ref name="Met NE England">{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/ne/ |title=North East England: climate |publisher=Met Office |access-date=18 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105223816/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/ne/ |archive-date=5 November 2013}}</ref> Between 1971 and 2000 Sheffield averaged {{cvt|824.7|mm|in}} of rain per year; December was the wettest month with {{cvt|91.9|mm|in}} and July the driest with {{cvt|51.0|mm|in}}.

The Weston Park Weather station, established in 1882, is one of the longest running weather stations in the United Kingdom. It has recorded weather for more than 125 years, and a 2008 report showed that the climate of Sheffield is warming faster than it has at any time during this period, with 1990 and 2006 being the hottest years on record.<ref>{{cite web |last=Boon |first=Gaynor |title=Whatever the Weather Changing Climate Changing Cultures |url=http://www.museums-sheffield.org.uk/PDFs/climate_change.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.museums-sheffield.org.uk/PDFs/climate_change.pdf |archive-date=9 October 2022 |url-status=live |publisher=Museums Sheffield |access-date=13 August 2010}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref> In collaboration with the [[Stockholm Environment Institute]], Sheffield developed a [[carbon footprint]] (based on 2004–05 consumption figures) of 5,798,361&nbsp;[[tonnes]] per year.

===Green belt===
{{further|South and West Yorkshire Green Belt|Geography of Sheffield}}
Sheffield is within a [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] region that extends into the wider surrounding counties, and is in place to reduce [[urban sprawl]], prevent the towns and areas in the [[Sheffield urban area|Sheffield built-up area]] conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage [[brownfield]] reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas, and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.<ref name="belt1">{{cite web |title=Green Belt Review |url=https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/content/sheffield/home/planning-development/green-belt-review.html |website=www.sheffield.gov.uk |access-date=24 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322143056/https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/content/sheffield/home/planning-development/green-belt-review.html |archive-date=22 March 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="belt2">{{cite web |title=Adopted Sheffield Local Plan |url=https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/content/sheffield/home/planning-development/sheffield-plan.html |website=www.sheffield.gov.uk |access-date=24 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322143241/https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/content/sheffield/home/planning-development/sheffield-plan.html |archive-date=22 March 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> The main urban area and larger villages of the borough are exempt from the green belt area, but surrounding smaller villages, hamlets and rural areas are 'washed over' with the designation.

===Subdivisions===
{{Main|Areas of Sheffield}}
Sheffield is made up of many suburbs and neighbourhoods, many of which developed from villages or [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]] that were absorbed into Sheffield as the city grew.<ref name="VICKERS"/> These historical areas are largely ignored by the modern administrative and political divisions of the city; instead it is divided into 28&nbsp;electoral [[ward (politics)|wards]], with each ward generally covering 4–6&nbsp;areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/your-city-council/elections/ward-boundaries |title=Sheffield's Ward Boundaries |access-date=29 December 2005 |publisher=Sheffield City Council |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051103102934/http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/your-city-council/elections/ward-boundaries |archive-date=3 November 2005}}</ref> These electoral wards are grouped into six [[United Kingdom constituencies|parliamentary constituencies]]. Sheffield is largely [[civil parishes in England|unparished]], but [[Bradfield, South Yorkshire|Bradfield]] and [[Ecclesfield]] have parish councils, and [[Stocksbridge]] has a town council.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/your-city-council/elections/types-of-elections |title=Types of Elections |publisher=Sheffield City Council |access-date=21 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725005232/http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/your-city-council/elections/types-of-elections |archive-date=25 July 2009}}</ref>

The [[Industrial Revolution]] served as a catalyst for considerable population growth and demographic change in Sheffield. Large numbers of people were driven to the city as the [[cutlery]] and steel industries flourished. The population continued to grow until the mid-20th century, at which point, due to industrial decline, the population began to contract. However, by the early 21st century, the population had begun to grow once again.

The population of Sheffield peaked in 1951 at 577,050, and has since declined steadily. However, the mid-2007 population estimate was 530,300, representing an increase of about 17,000 residents since 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=15106 |title=Population estimates for UK, England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland |work=National Statistics Online |publisher=Office for National Statistics |access-date=22 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216083533/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=15106 |archive-date=16 December 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Although a city, Sheffield is informally known as "the [[largest village in England]]",<ref name="BaldwinBottomsWalker" /><ref name="Binfield" /><ref name="BurgoyneClark" /> because of a combination of topographical isolation and demographic stability.<ref name="BaldwinBottomsWalker" /> It is relatively geographically isolated, being cut off from other places by a ring of hills.<ref name="Hampton" /><ref name="TaylorEvansFraser" /> Local folklore insists that, like Rome, Sheffield was built "on seven hills".<ref name="TaylorEvansFraser" /> The land surrounding Sheffield was unsuitable for industrial use,<ref name="BaldwinBottomsWalker" /> and now includes several protected [[green belt]] areas.<ref name="Mann" /> These topographical factors have served to restrict urban spread,<ref name="Mann" /> resulting in a relatively stable population size and a low degree of mobility.

[[Sidney Pollard]]'s analysis of the 1851 Census data caused him to describe Sheffield as "the most proletarian city in England" at the time, it has more people per 100,000 employed in manufacturing occupations (188 for Sheffield, as compared to 146 for Leeds) and fewer people per 100,000 employed in professional occupations (41 for Sheffield, as compared to 66 for Birmingham, and 43 for Leeds).{{dubious|date=July 2012}} He attributed this to the cutlery trade in the city, which was organised not on polarised Capital-versus-Labour lines, but as a complex network of contracts between cutlery workshops, craftsmen and merchants, whose positive influence on community cohesion and equality lasted through the rise of the steel industry in the city later in the 19th&nbsp; century. Even by 1981, social polarisation (as defined by the Census and Registrar-General) in Sheffield was far lower than in many other cities, with only 4% of the population having professional occupations, as opposed to 62% classified as skilled or unskilled manual laborers.<ref name=TaylorEvansFraser /> -->

=== Heavy industries and metallurgy ===
[[File:Harry Brearley.jpg|thumb|right|Monument to [[Harry Brearley]] and the birthplace of [[stainless steel]] at the former [[Firth Brown Steels|Brown Firth Research Laboratories]] ]]
Sheffield has an international reputation for metallurgy and steel-making.<ref>There are numerous sources showing the international reputation of Sheffield for metallurgy, and in particular steel and cutlery manufacture. Some examples are: the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], which begins its entry for ''Sheffield'', "The name of a manufacturing city of Yorkshire, famous for cutlery"; and the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', which in its entry for "Sheffield" states that by 1830 Sheffield had earned "recognition as the world centre of high-grade steel manufacture". [[David Hey]] in the preface to his 1997 book ''Mesters to Masters: A History of the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire.'' ([[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-828997-9}}) states "It (Sheffield) was known for its cutlery wares long before the incorporation of the [[Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire|Cutlers' Company]] in 1624, and long before it acquired an international reputation as the steel capital of the world."</ref> The earliest official record of cutlery production, for which Sheffield is particularly well known, is from 1297 when a tax return for 'Robert the Cutler' was submitted.<ref name="welcometosheffield.co.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.welcometosheffield.co.uk/invest/engineering-and-manufacturing/made-in-sheffield |title=Welcome to Sheffield &#124; Made In Sheffield |website=www.welcometosheffield.co.uk |access-date=2 November 2020 |archive-date=26 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201026165456/http://www.welcometosheffield.co.uk/invest/engineering-and-manufacturing/made-in-sheffield |url-status=live }}</ref> A key reason for Sheffield's success in the production of cutlery lies in its geographic makeup. The abundance of streams in the area provided water power and the geological formations in the [[Hope Valley, Derbyshire|Hope Valley]], in particular, provided sufficient grit stones for grinding wheels.<ref name="welcometosheffield.co.uk" /> In the 17th century, the [[Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire]], which oversaw the booming cutlery industry in the area and remains to this day, was established and focused on markets outside the Sheffield area, leading to the gradual establishment of Sheffield as a respected producer of cutlery.<ref name="welcometosheffield.co.uk" /> this gradually developed from a national reputation into an international one.<ref name="welcometosheffield.co.uk" />

Playing a crucial role in the [[Industrial Revolution]], the city became an industrial powerhouse in the 18th century, and was dubbed "[[Steel City]]".<ref name="Steel BBC">{{cite news |title=Made in Great Britain, Series 1, Steel |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bpz4ks |access-date=28 March 2019 |agency=BBC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328125550/https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bpz4ks |archive-date=28 March 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Many innovations in these fields have been made in Sheffield, for example [[Benjamin Huntsman]] discovered the [[crucible technique]] in the 1740s at his workshop in [[Handsworth, South Yorkshire|Handsworth]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mezenin |first=N. |year=1972 |title=Huntsman |journal=Metallurgist |publisher=Springer |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=510–512 |doi=10.1007/BF00731738}}</ref> This process was rendered obsolete in 1856 by [[Henry Bessemer]]'s invention of the [[Bessemer converter]].

=== Public sector ===

Sheffield has a large public sector workforce, numbering 77,500 workers. During the period 1995 – 2008 (a period of growth for the city and many others in the UK), the number of jobs in the city increased by 22% and 50% of these were in the public sector.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.centreforcities.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/11-10-17_Sheffield_Appendix.pdf |title=Appendix: Sheffield data analysis |website=centreforcities.org |access-date=26 July 2021 |archive-date=15 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210815043253/https://www.centreforcities.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/11-10-17_Sheffield_Appendix.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> Major public sector employers include the [[National Health Service]], The University of Sheffield, [[Sheffield Hallam University]], and numerous government departments and agencies including the [[Home Office]] (Visas & Immigration), [[Department for Education]] & [[Department for Business, Innovation & Skills]]. Recently developed offices in St Paul's Place and [[Riverside Exchange]] play host to the aforementioned government departments.

[[Sheffield City Council]], which is also a major public sector employer in the city, employs over 8,000 people, spread across four different sections (known as portfolios). Sheffield City Council is also the [[Local Education Authority]] (LEA) and as such manages all states schools and their associated staff. As part of its mandate to provide public services, Sheffield City Council maintains contracts with three private contractors – [[Amey plc|Amey]], [[Veolia]] & [[Capita]] (contract ending in 2020). Together, these contractors provide additional employment in the city.

With the decline in high street shopping around the UK, efforts have been made to rejuvenate Sheffield City Centre and improve the retail and leisure offering. Major developments include [[Leopold Square]], [[The Moor Quarter|The Moor]], St Paul's Place (a mixed use development) and the [[Heart of the City, Sheffield|Heart of the City]] I & II projects. In March 2022 Sheffield City Council announced that a new leisure hub would be constructed at the southern end of Fargate.

Beyond the city centre there are numerous other leisure and shopping areas. To the south-west of the city centre is [[Ecclesall Road]], a major thoroughfare connecting the south-western suburbs to the city centre and lined with bars, restaurants and cafes, as well as housing.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thisissheffield.com/ecclesall/ |title=This Is Ecclesall – Your Guide To Ecclesall & Surrounding Areas |date=7 January 2020 |website=www.thisissheffield.com |accessdate=18 June 2022 |archive-date=3 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210803221050/https://www.thisissheffield.com/ecclesall/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The area has a large student community owing to the presence of the Sheffield Hallam University Collegiate Campus adjacent to Ecclesall Road. The leisure section of the road is approximately {{cvt|2.5|km|order=flip}} long, with the south-western end becoming Ecclesall Road South and a predominantly
residential area. Another popular shopping and leisure area is [[London Road (Sheffield)|London Road]], to the south of the city centre.

To the west of the city centre is [[Broomhill and Sharrow Vale|Broomhill]], a student-centric neighbourhood which also caters for school students as well local university students and NHS staff. To the north-west of the city centre are [[Hillsborough, Sheffield|Hillsborough]], a large retail and sports hub, and [[Stocksbridge]] Fox Valley, a modern leisure and retail centre built on a brownfield industrial site.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.foxvalleysheffield.co.uk/ |title=Welcome to Fox Valley, Sheffield – Retail shopping at Fox Valley, Sheffield |publisher=Foxvalleysheffield.co.uk |date= |accessdate=19 June 2022 |archive-date=26 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220626014747/https://www.foxvalleysheffield.co.uk/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the late 2010s and early 2020s several new developments began to the north of the city centre in the [[Kelham Island Quarter]], an increasingly popular mixed-use development. The area has become known for its independent cafes, restaurants and pubs and has seen significant residential development in recent years.

=== Tourism ===
Tourism plays a major role in the city's economy on account of [[List of tourist attractions in Sheffield|numerous attractions]] – namely the Peak District, sports events (in particular, the [[Snooker World Championships]]) and musical festivals (such as [[Tramlines]]). In 2019, the tourism industry in Sheffield was valued at £1.36&nbsp;billion and supported 15,000 jobs.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/politics/sheffield-facing-5000-tourism-and-hospitality-industry-job-losses-due-coronavirus-2934237 |title=Emergency help plea for Yorkshire's 'crown jewel' tourism sector as thousands of job losses forecast |work=Yorkshire Post |access-date=2 November 2020 |archive-date=26 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201026215125/https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/politics/sheffield-facing-5000-tourism-and-hospitality-industry-job-losses-due-coronavirus-2934237 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Although hilly, Sheffield is compact and has few major trunk roads, therefore [[cycling in South Yorkshire|cycling in Sheffield]] is a popular method of transport. It is on the [[Trans-Pennine Trail]], a [[National Cycle Network]] route running from West to East from [[Southport]] in Merseyside to [[Hornsea]] in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]] and North to South from [[Leeds]] in West Yorkshire to [[Chesterfield, Derbyshire|Chesterfield]] in Derbyshire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transpenninetrail.org.uk/ |title=Welcome to the Trans Pennine Trail – Home Page |publisher=Trans Pennine Trail |access-date=7 August 2009 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516175804/http://www.transpenninetrail.org.uk/ |archive-date=16 May 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> There are many cycle routes going along country paths in the woods surrounding the city, and an increasing number of cycle lanes in the city itself.

There are several local rail routes running along the city's valleys and beyond, connecting it with other parts of [[South Yorkshire]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[Nottinghamshire]], [[Lincolnshire]] and [[Derbyshire]]. These local routes include the [[Penistone Line]], the [[Dearne Valley Line]], the [[Hope Valley Line]] and the [[Hallam Line]]. As well as the main stations of [[Sheffield railway station|Sheffield]] and Meadowhall, there are five suburban stations at [[Chapeltown railway station|Chapeltown]], [[Darnall railway station|Darnall]], [[Woodhouse railway station|Woodhouse]] and [[Dore & Totley railway station|Dore & Totley]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/css/NetworkRail_LiverpoolLeedsManchesterSheffieldmap.pdf |title=Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield rail map |work=National Rail Enquiries |publisher=ATOC Limited |access-date=13 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016080739/http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/css/NetworkRail_LiverpoolLeedsManchesterSheffieldmap.pdf |archive-date=16 October 2013}}</ref> As part of improvements to rail services along the Hope Valley Line between Sheffield and Manchester, a new platform, station facilities and track are being built at Dore & Totley Station with the expanded station due to open in 2023.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.co.uk/news/transport/picture-shows-work-to-speed-up-sheffield-to-manchester-trains-is-underway-3611856 |title=Picture shows work to speed up Sheffield to Manchester trains is underway |work=The Star |accessdate=18 June 2022 |archive-date=7 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220707180652/http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/transport/picture-shows-work-to-speed-up-sheffield-to-manchester-trains-is-underway-3611856 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Sheffield Supertram - Tram Train 399 204 (geograph 5940823).jpg|thumb|alt=A Sheffield Supertram in current blue, orange and red Stagecoach livery. |A [[Sheffield Supertram]]]]
The [[Sheffield Supertram]] (not derived from the [[Sheffield Tramway|previous tramways]]), opened in 1994 and was operated by [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]]. The opening was shortly after the similar [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]] scheme in Greater Manchester. The Supertram network consists of {{cvt|37|mi|km}} of track and four lines (with all lines running via the city centre): from Halfway to [[Malin Bridge]] (Blue Line), from Meadowhall to [[Middlewood, South Yorkshire|Middlewood]] (Yellow Line), from Cathedral to [[Herdings Park]] (Purple Line),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.supertram.net/about.html |title=About Us |work=Stagecoach Supertram website |publisher=Stagecoach Group |access-date=19 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704091815/http://www.supertram.net/about.html |archive-date=4 July 2009}}</ref> and the from [[Sheffield Cathedral|Cathedral]] to [[Rotherham Parkgate tram stop|Rotherham Parkgate]] (Black Line).

===Canal===
[[File:Victoria Quays - Sheffield.jpg|thumb|alt=Victoria Quays, Sheffield Canal |[[Victoria Quays]]]]

The [[Sheffield & South Yorkshire Navigation]] (S&SY) is a system of navigable inland waterways ([[canal]]s and canalised rivers) in Yorkshire and [[Lincolnshire]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waterscape.com/canals-and-rivers/sheffield-and-south-yorkshire-navigation/history |title=History of the Sheffield & South Yorkshire Navigation |work=waterscape |publisher=British Waterways |access-date=21 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803071812/http://www.waterscape.com/canals-and-rivers/sheffield-and-south-yorkshire-navigation/history |archive-date=3 August 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref> Chiefly based on the [[River Don, South Yorkshire|River Don]], it runs for a length of {{cvt|43|mi|km}} and has 29&nbsp;[[canal lock|locks]].

===Air===
The closest airports are in [[Leeds Bradford Airport|Leeds Bradford]], [[Humberside Airport|Humberside]], [[East Midlands Airport|East Midlands]] (within an hour's drive of the city), [[Manchester Airport|Manchester]] (hourly direct service by [[TransPennine Express]]).

Due to the topographical nature of the city, Sheffield was not served by its own airport. In May 1990, [[Sheffield Development Corporation]] entered into an agreement with A. F. Budge (Mining) Ltd for the construction and operation of the airport and the development of adjacent land. In 1997, [[Sheffield City Airport]] was opened on land close to the M1 and the Sheffield Parkway. The airport was operated on STOLPORT model similar to [[London City Airport]] and operated a limited range of short range business focused flights to destinations in the [[British Isles]] and the [[Netherlands]]. The airport fell into decline with the growth of low cost airlines in the late 1990s and the last scheduled flight took place in 2002. The airport closed and lost its [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|Civil Aviation Authority]] license in 2008.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.co.uk/our-towns-and-cities/sheffield/retro-the-rise-and-fall-of-sheffield-airport-1-7797521 |title=RETRO: The rise and fall of Sheffield Airport |work=The Star |access-date=20 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020223802/https://www.thestar.co.uk/our-towns-and-cities/sheffield/retro-the-rise-and-fall-of-sheffield-airport-1-7797521 |archive-date=20 October 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Doncaster Sheffield Airport]] (also known as Robin Hood Airport) then became the closest international airport to Sheffield, located {{cvt|18|mi|km}} from the city centre. It opened on 28 April 2005 on the former [[RAF Finningley]] site and was served mainly by charter and budget airlines, with about one million passengers a year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.robinhoodairport.com/media-centre/background-information.html |title=Robin Hood Airport Background Information |work=Robin Hood Airport website |publisher=Robin Hood Airport |access-date=21 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223125527/http://www.robinhoodairport.com/media-centre/background-information.html |archive-date=23 December 2010}}</ref> Destinations had included the Canary Islands, Balearics, Greece, Turkey, Poland and the Baltic countries with [[TUI Airways]] and [[Wizz Air]] operating from the airport.

Sheffield's museums are managed by two distinct organisations. [[Museums Sheffield]] manages the [[Weston Park Museum]] (a Grade II* listed Building), [[Millennium Galleries]] and [[Graves Art Gallery]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Our Museums |url=http://www.museums-sheffield.org.uk/museums/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007153402/http://www.museums-sheffield.org.uk/museums/ |archive-date=7 October 2013 |access-date=13 October 2013 |publisher=Museums Sheffield}}</ref> These museums constitute the oldest extant museums in the city, with Graves Art Gallery and Weston Park Museum being gifted to the city by industrialist philanthropists in the 19th and 20th centuries. The Millennium Galleries, being established in the early 2000s, is one of the newest museums and constitutes part of the Heart of the City development, connecting directly to the Winter Garden and Millennium Square. All three museums host a broad range of exhibits which reflect Sheffield's history and numerous other themes, including exhibitions on loan from other major galleries and museums.

===Universities, colleges and UTCs===
[[File:Sheffield Uni.jpg|thumb|alt=Red brick university building|[[Firth Court]], the administrative and ceremonial centre of the University of Sheffield]]

The city's universities are [[the University of Sheffield]] and Sheffield Hallam University. The two combined bring about 60,000&nbsp;students to the city every year.<ref name="HESA citation">{{HESA citation}}</ref> The University of Sheffield is the city's oldest university. It was established in 1897 as University College Sheffield and gained university status in 1905. Its history traces back to Sheffield Medical School found in 1828, Firth College in 1879 and Sheffield Technical School in 1884. The university is one of the original [[red brick universities]] and is a member of the [[Russell Group]].
[[File:Sheffield City Centre and station.jpg|thumb|left|Sheffield Hallam University city campus seen from South Street Park]]
Sheffield Hallam University (SHU) is a university on two sites in Sheffield. City Campus is located in the city centre, close to Sheffield railway station, and [[Collegiate Crescent]] Campus is about {{cvt|2|mi|km}} away, adjacent to [[Ecclesall Road]] in south-west Sheffield. Sheffield Hallam University's history goes back to 1843 with the establishment of the Sheffield School of Design. During the 1960s several independent colleges (including the School of Design) joined to become Sheffield Polytechnic (Sheffield City Polytechnic from 1976) and was finally renamed Sheffield Hallam University in 1992.

Launched by the [[Coalition Government 2010-2015|coalition government]] in 2010, the [[University Technical College]] program was designed to foster greater interest in [[STEM]] subjects amongst students aged 14 to 18. Sheffield currently hosts two UTCs, [[UTC Sheffield City Centre]] and [[UTC Sheffield Olympic Legacy Park]]. All UTCs, including those in Sheffield, are sponsored by the Baker Dearing Educational Trust,<ref name="bakertrust">{{cite web |url=http://www.utcolleges.org/media/15074/a5_flyer.pdf |title=University Technical Colleges |access-date=4 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610031435/http://www.utcolleges.org/media/15074/a5_flyer.pdf |archive-date=10 June 2013}}</ref> established by [[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Lord Baker]]. The two UTCs in Sheffield are also sponsored and supported by Sheffield Hallam University. Whilst the UTCs are equivalent to regular secondary schools and sixth forms, their governance structure and curriculum are different, owing to their status as free schools and focusing on STEM, as opposed to a broader curriculum.

Sheffield and Hallam are today Sheffield's two major non-league sides, although Sheffield now play just outside the city in nearby [[Dronfield]], Derbyshire. Sheffield and Hallam contest what has become known as the Sheffield derby. By 1860 there were 15&nbsp;football clubs in Sheffield, with the first ever amateur league and cup competitions taking place in the city.<ref>{{cite book |last=Harvey |first=Adrian |title=Football: the first hundred years: the untold story |url=https://archive.org/details/footballfirsthun00harv |url-access=limited |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/footballfirsthun00harv/page/n116 92]–125 |chapter=Britain's first football culture—Sheffield 1857–67 |isbn=0-415-35019-0}}</ref>

Sheffield is best known for its two professional football teams, [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], nicknamed ''The Blades'', and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], nicknamed [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.#Nickname|''The Owls'']]. United, who play at [[Bramall Lane]] south of the city centre, compete in the [[Premier League]] and Wednesday, who play at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] in the north-west of the city, compete in the [[EFL Championship]]. The two clubs contest the [[Steel City Derby]], which is considered by many to be one of the most fierce football rivalries in English Football.<ref>{{cite news |title=The 20 fiercest rivalries in English Football |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/picturegalleries/11197636/The-20-fiercest-rivalries-in-English-football-by-Jonathan-Liew.html?frame=3090046 |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |access-date=7 August 2015 |location=London |date=11 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814202727/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/picturegalleries/11197636/The-20-fiercest-rivalries-in-English-football-by-Jonathan-Liew.html?frame=3090046 |archive-date=14 August 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In the pre-war era, both Wednesday and United enjoyed large amounts of success and found themselves two of the country's top clubs; Sheffield Wednesday have been champions of the Football League four times – in [[1902–03 Football League|1902–03]], [[1903-04 Football League|1903–04]], [[1928-29 Football League|1928–29]] and [[1929-30 Football League|1929–30]], whilst Sheffield United have won it once, in [[1897-98 Football League|1897–98]]. During the 1970s and early 1980s the two sides fell from grace, with Wednesday finding themselves in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] by the mid-70s and United as far as the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in [[1980-81 in English football|1981]]. Wednesday once again became one of England's high-flying clubs following promotion back to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in [[1983-84 in English football|1984]], winning the [[1991 Football League Cup Final|League Cup in 1991]], competing in the [[1992–93 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup in 1992–93]], and reaching the final of both the [[1993 Football League Cup Final|League Cup]] and [[1993 FA Cup Final|FA Cup]] in the [[1992-93 in English football|same season]].

United and Wednesday were both founding members of the [[Premier League|FA Premier League]] in 1992, but The Blades were relegated in [[1993-94 in English football|1994]]. The Owls remained until [[1999-00 in English football|2000]]. Both clubs had gone into decline in the 21st&nbsp; century, Wednesday twice relegated to [[Football League One|League One]] and United suffering the same fate in [[2010-11 in English football|2011]], despite a brief spell in the Premier League in [[2006-07 in English football|2006–07]]. United was promoted to the Premier League in 2019 under manager, and Sheffield United Fan, Chris Wilder. Despite being written off by most football pundits, and declared favourites for relegation from the Premier League, United exceeded expectations and finished in the top half of the table in the 2019–20 season. In the 2020–21 season, United sat at the bottom of the Premier League table by the conclusion of the season and were relegated.

Sheffield was the site of the deadliest sports venue disaster in the United Kingdom, the [[Hillsborough disaster]] in 1989, when 97 [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] supporters were killed in a stampede and crush during an [[FA Cup]] semi-final at the venue.

[[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]], who play in the Championship, did play their home games in the city between 2008 and 2012, having moved to play at Sheffield's [[Don Valley Stadium]] in 2008 following a dispute with their previous landlord at their traditional home ground of [[Millmoor]], Rotherham. However, in July 2012, the club moved to the new 12,000 seat [[New York Stadium]] in Rotherham. There are also facilities for golf, [[climbing]] and bowling, as well as a newly inaugurated national ice-skating arena ([[IceSheffield]]).

Sheffield has a District Energy system that exploits the city's domestic waste, by [[Sheffield Incinerator|incinerating]] it and converting the energy from it to electricity. It also provides hot water, which is distributed through over {{cvt|25|mi|km|-1}} of pipes under the city, via two networks. These networks supply heat and hot water for many buildings throughout the city. These include not only cinemas, hospitals, shops and offices, but also universities (Sheffield Hallam University and the University of Sheffield), and residential properties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.energy.rochester.edu/uk/sheffield/ |title=Sheffield Heat and Power |last=Pierce |first=Morris&nbsp;A. |year=1996 |work=District Energy in Great Britain |publisher=World Wide Web Virtual Library for District Energy |access-date=19 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421220354/http://www.energy.rochester.edu/uk/sheffield/ |archive-date=21 April 2009}}</ref> Energy generated in a waste plant produces 60&nbsp;[[megawatt]]s of thermal energy and up to 19&nbsp;[[megawatt]]s of electrical energy from 225,000&nbsp;[[tonnes]] of waste.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.veoliaenvironmentalservices.co.uk/sheffield/pages/district_facts.asp |title=Facts & Figures |work=Veolia Environmental Services website |publisher=Veolia Environmental Services |access-date=6 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425210948/http://www.veoliaenvironmentalservices.co.uk/sheffield/pages/district_facts.asp |archive-date=25 April 2009}}</ref>
