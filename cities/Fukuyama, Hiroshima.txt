{{nihongo|'''Fukuyama'''|福山市|Fukuyama-shi}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] in [[Hiroshima Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. {{As of|2023|03|31}}, the city had an estimated [[population]] of 459,160 in 214259 households and a [[population density]] of 890 persons per km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name="Fukuyama-hp">{{cite web |url=https://www.city.fukuyama.hiroshima.jp/soshiki/shimin/260828.html|title= Fukuyama city official statistics|location= Japan|language= ja}}</ref> The total area of the city is {{convert|518.14|sqkm|sqmi}}. After [[Hiroshima, Hiroshima|Hiroshima]], it is the largest city in [[Hiroshima Prefecture]]. The city's symbol is the rose and it holds an annual Rose Festival in the month of May. The official mascot of Fukuyama is an anthropomorphic rose child by the name of Rola.

==Geography==
Fukuyama City is located in southeastern Hiroshima Prefecture. The center of the city is located in the Fukuyama Plain, which has been built by [[land reclamation]] projects since the [[Edo period]], and the delta area that spreads out at the mouth of the [[Ashida River]], which flows north and south through the city. The southern end of the city faces the [[Seto Inland Sea]], and the northern mountainous area, which is the southern end of the so-called 'Jinseki Plateau', at the southwestern end of the Kibi Plateau with an elevation of 400 to 500 meters in connected to the [[Chugoku Mountains]]. The highest peak in the city is Mt. Kyonoue at 611 meters above sea level. This is the basin of the Oda River, a tributary of the [[Takahashi River]] that flows into [[Kurashiki, Okayama]]. The urban area is roughly divided into the former Fukuyama city, the eastern (Zao, Kasuga) district, the southern (Tomo, Numakuma) district, the Matsunaga (former Matsunaga City) district, and the northern (Kannabe, Ekiya, Kamo) districts. Fukuyama expanded by incorporated neighboring municipalities one after another, but because the eastern part was blocked by the prefectural border and the southern part by the sea, the city limits expanded to the north and west.

== History ==
The Fukuyama area is part of ancient [[Bingo Province]], but until large-scale land reclamation projects in the [[Edo Period]], it was largely [[tidal flat]]s or part of the sea. An exception was the Ekiya neighborhood of northern Fukuyama, which was a [[shukuba|post station]] on the old [[Sanyōdō]] highway. In the Edo Period, [[Fukuyama Castle]] and its surrounding [[jōkamachi|castle town]] was founded as a castle town in 1619 by [[Mizuno clan|Mizuno Katsunari]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://visithiroshima.net/things_to_do/attractions/historical_places/fukuyama_castle.html| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211022/http://visithiroshima.net/things_to_do/attractions/historical_places/fukuyama_castle.html| archive-date=2021-10-22|title=Fukuyama Castle - Visit Hiroshima|website=Fukuyama Castle - Visit Hiroshima|access-date=2018-09-29}}{{cbignore}}</ref> a cousin of ''[[Shōgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]. Mizuno was given command of a territory  consisting of southern [[Bingo Province]] and southwestern [[Bitchū Province]]. The Mizuno were later replaced by the [[Abe clan]]. Following the [[Meiji restoration]], the town of Fukuyama was established on April 1,1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system.

Fukuyama Town became Fukuyama City on July 1, 1916. The population of the city at that time was 32,356. In 1933, ten villages from surrounding [[Fukayasu District, Hiroshima|Fukayasu District]] were merged into Fukuyama. Two additional villages from [[Numakuma District, Hiroshima|Numakuma District]] were similarly merged in 1942. On August 8, 1945 (two days after the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic-bombing of Hiroshima]]), 91 [[United States|American]] [[B-29 Superfortress|B-29]] bombers made an air raid on Fukuyama, destroying much of the city.

On March 31, 1954, several [[Towns of Japan|towns]] and villages in Kōrimatsu District merged to found the city of Matsunaga. Matsunaga City would eventually merge with Fukuyama City on May 1, 1966. Several towns and villages from the Fukayasu District merged into Fukuyama in 1956, and Fukayasu Town merged in 1962. On April 1, 1974, Ashida Town in [[Ashina District, Hiroshima|Ashina District]] merged with Fukuyama, followed by Kamo Town, Fukayasu District and Ekiya Town, Ashina District on February 1, 1975,.

Fukuyama was promoted to [[Core cities of Japan|core city]] status on April 1, 1998 with greater local autonomy.

Several other surrounding towns and districts subsequently merged with Fukuyama: 
*February 3, 2003, [[Utsumi, Hiroshima|Utsumi]] Town in Numakuma District and [[Shin'ichi, Hiroshima|Shin'ichi]] Town in Ashina District, thereby dissolving Ashina District
*February 1, 2005 [[Numakuma, Hiroshima|Numakuma]] Town, dissolving Numakuma District
