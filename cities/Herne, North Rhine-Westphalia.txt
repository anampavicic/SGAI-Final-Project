'''Herne''' ({{IPA|de|ˈhɛʁnə|-|Herne.ogg}}) is a city in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Germany. It is located in the [[Ruhr area]] directly between the cities of [[Bochum]], and [[Gelsenkirchen]].

== History ==
{{Original research|date=March 2017}}
Herne (ancient Haranni) was a tiny village until the 19th century. When the mining of coal (and possibly ore) and the production of coke (the fuel processed from the harvested coal) and steel began, the villages of the Ruhr area had an influx of people, mostly from the east of Germany.

Herne is located on the direct axis between [[Bochum]] to the south and [[Recklinghausen]] to the north, with Münster in the north, [[Gelsenkirchen]] to the west, and [[Castrop-Rauxel]] and [[Dortmund]] to the east. The physical border between Herne and Recklinghausen is the bridge at the Bochumer Strasse across the [[Rhine–Herne Canal]].  A little further north of the canal flows the [[Emscher|Emscher river]], with the former abundance of wild horses that were caught in the Emscher Valley (Emschertal), then sold and/or traded at the yearly horse market at Crange, which later developed into the "[[Cranger Kirmes]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cranger-kirmes.de/presse/zahlen-daten-fakten.html|title=Zahlen, Daten, Fakten|publisher=Stadt Herne|access-date=2019-01-30|language=de}}</ref> After [[World War II]], Herne was known as "Die Goldene Stadt" ("The Golden City") because of the comparatively limited damage suffered during World War II.{{Cn|date=December 2023}}

Present-day Herne includes the former settlements of Haranni, originating at the south end of the [[Bahnhofstrasse]] and just across the Evangelische Hauptkirche Herne (main Lutheran Church—seems to be called "Kreuzkirche" now) and the crossing of Sodingerstrasse, running to the east at that point, then turning into Wiescherstrasse; formerly independent settlements or villages like Baukau, Börnig, Crange, Horsthausen, Pöppinghausen, Sodingen, and others became the present Herne. These farms bearing these names were probably or possibly found in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1860, the first of a number of coal mines started operating. In the following thirty years, the population increased twenty-fold. In 1975, Wanne-Eickel, by then a city with over 70,000 inhabitants, was incorporated into Herne, which had a population larger than "Wanne-Eickel" at that point in time.

=== World War II ===
Herne was targeted by the [[RAF|Royal Air Force]] on 4 June 1940, early in World War II, and air raids became daily and nightly occurrences. On one occasion, three high-explosive torpedo-bombs were dropped, severely damaging a number of houses in the Vincke-Strasse (only some of the outer shell had remained) and resulting in the deaths of all the inhabitants.{{Cn|date=December 2023}} [[White phosphorus munitions|Phosphorus bombs]] were dropped in several locations and caused fires that lasted for days. The canal was the major mode of transportation for coal and coke from the many coal mines in the area to the factories for iron ore to be processed into steel (Blau-Stahl), and coal was transported along the inter-connecting waterways in all other directions to be used for industrial as well as domestic use. In particular, the bridge across [[Rhine–Herne Canal]], closest to the easternmost double-chambered lock and the wharf on the north shore, was hit and taken out.

The [[Krupp]] Treibstoffwerke oil refinery near the local Shamrock, ¾ of the coal mine, was bombed during the [[Oil Campaign of World War II|oil campaign of World War II]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1937 Establishment of Krupp Treibstoffwerk GmbH. |url=http://www.thyssenkrupp.com/en/konzern/geschichte_chronik_k1937.html |website=thyssenkrupp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175801/http://www.thyssenkrupp.com/en/konzern/geschichte_chronik_k1937.html |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
