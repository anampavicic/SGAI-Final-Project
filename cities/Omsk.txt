'''Omsk''' ({{IPAc-en|'|ɒ|m|s|k}}; {{langx|ru|Омск}}, {{IPA|ru|omsk|IPA}}) is the [[administrative center]] and largest [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of [[Omsk Oblast]], [[Russia]]. It is situated in southwestern [[Siberia]] and has a population of over 1.1 million. Omsk is the third [[List of cities and towns in Russia by population|largest city]] in Siberia after [[Novosibirsk]] and [[Krasnoyarsk]], and the twelfth-largest city in Russia.<ref name=2021Census>{{cite web|title=Оценка численности постоянного населения по субъектам Российской Федерации|url=https://rosstat.gov.ru/storage/mediabank/tab-5_VPN-2020.xlsx|publisher=[[Federal State Statistics Service (Russia)|Federal State Statistics Service]]|accessdate=1 September 2022}}</ref> It is an important [[transport node]], serving as a train station for the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] and as a staging post for the [[Irtysh|Irtysh River]].

[[File:Омск, Нефтяники.jpg|thumb|Omsk]] 

During the [[Russian Empire|Imperial]] era, Omsk was the seat of the Governor General of Western Siberia and, later, of the [[Governor-Generalship of the Steppes|Governor General of the Steppes]]. For a brief period during the [[Russian Civil War]] in 1918–1920, it served as the capital of the anti-Bolshevik [[Russian State (1918–1920)|Russian State]] and held the imperial gold reserves.

Omsk serves as the [[episcopal see]] of the bishop of Omsk and [[Tara, Omsk Oblast|Tara]], as well as the administrative seat of the Imam of Siberia. The mayor is Sergey Shelest.

==Etymology==
The city of Omsk is named after the [[Om (river)|Om river]]. This [[hydronym]] in the dialect of [[Baraba Tatars]] means "the quiet one".

===Imperial period===
{{tone|section|date=January 2023}}
The creation of the Omsk fortress, like other Upper Irtysh fortresses, was caused by the urgent need to strengthen the trade route to China. The credit for their arrangement belongs entirely to the Siberian governor, Prince M.P. Gagarin. However, he also bears a large share of the responsibility. Gagarin, being the governor in [[Nerchinsk]] and then the head of the Siberian order and the Siberian province, devoted a lot of time and effort to trade with [[China]]. And above all, he organized the trade route to this country. 

The main route passed from [[Tobolsk]], down the Irtysh, then up the Ob, then along the Ket portage to the Yenisei, and on to the border with China. The journey was long, difficult, and expensive. There was also a second option - up the Irtysh, twice shorter and much easier. Kalmyk, Kyrgyz-Kaisak and Chinese chiefs were interested in this route as they all had their share of international trade. However, above the mouth of the Ob, trade caravans were attacked by free detachments of [[Kalmyks]] (Oirats) and Kirghiz-Kaisaks, which their rulers could not cope with. A reliable guard was needed with its placement in stationary fortifications.

In May 1714, the Siberian governor received the [[Tsar of all Russia|tsar's]] consent to build fortresses along the Irtysh and to the existing trade route. In his report to the tsar on May 22, 1714, Gagarin substantiated the need to build fortresses along the Irtysh to ensure communication and safety of the expedition going to the city of [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]] for the golden sand. 

The gold deposit was behind the Tien Shan ridges, on the territory of a neighboring state, in the [[Taklamakan Desert]]. Prince Gagarin understood the consequences of this adventure. With a positive result, this would threaten a military conflict with China and [[Dzungar people|Dzungaria]]. Of course, the Siberian governor did not expect the military expedition to reach Yarkand. It was almost impossible and unnecessary. The fortresses along the trade route would remain. The tsar believed in the governor and signed a decree organizing an expedition under the command of a former captain of the Guards, Army Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Bukholts, about the construction of fortresses along the Irtysh above Yamyshev.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bk55.ru/news/article/112417/|title=1717 год. Омские крепость и слобода}}</ref><ref>[http://www.admomsk.ru/web/guest/city/history/timeline Omsk history timeline] (in Russian)</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lib.omsk.ru/ip/evseev/node/119?page=show|title=Исторические предпосылки основания Омской крепости}}</ref>

On January 2, 1716, Matvey Petrovich Gagarin took up his governor's duties and actively took up the construction of fortresses in Siberia including those on Lake Kosogol, and the Yenisei and Irtysh rivers. Between January 8-10, 1716, the prince met with the king and made him an offer as a golden collection from the ancient burial mounds plundered along the [[Ishim River|Ishim]] and Irtysh.

At the meeting, Gagarin reported to Peter about his plans for the development of Siberia and received the tsar's permission, presumably as the highest resolution. On January 27, 1716, Peter I left for Europe, where he stayed until October 1717 and ceased receiving timely and reliable information from Siberia. In January 1716, Gagarin (regarding the tsar's decree) issued his own orders for the construction of a fortress on the frontier of Kosogol Lake and in April on the construction of the fortresses on the Upper Yenisei.

On April 28, the Buholz detachment abandoned the Yamyshev fortress and moved down the Irtysh to the territory of the Tarsky district. Gagarin assessed the situation and gave instructions to Lieutenant Colonel Buholz and the Tara commandant to build a fortress at the mouth of the [[Om (river)|Om]] and sent recruits to reinforce them. By the end of 1716, the first fortress (fortified place) was built in the modern river station. It comprised an earthen pentagonal fortress, powder and food stores, barracks for soldiers, and houses for officers. 

The first Omsk fortress (fortified place) was practically a copy of the fortress erected in 1715 near Yamyshevskoye Lake. However, it also had a significant drawback: the fortifications were scattered and the outer fence was weak. When the enemy attacked, the entire garrison would have to defend the fortress with objects separate from each other. This actually happened in 1716 during the defense of the Yamyshevskaya fortress. The unsuccessful layout of the first Yamyshev and Omsk fortresses was explained by the lack of fortification experience among the construction managers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vestnik.utmn.ru/upload/iblock/01d/140_148.pdf|title=Первый сибирский губернатор М. П. Гагарин и основание русской крепости на реке Омь}}</ref><ref>Колесников А. Д. Основание Омской крепости и её роль в заселении Прииртышья // Известия Омского отделения Географического общества Союза ССР. Омск: Западно-Сибирское книжное издательство. Омское отделение, 1965. С. 133—135</ref>

At the beginning of [[1717]], the dragoon captain, Ilya Gavrilovich Aksakov, was requested to make the trip from Russia. The Governor conferred a major on him and directed him to supervise the construction of a new (second) fortress at the mouth of the [[Om (river)|Om]].
In the summer of 1717, the Omsk garrison under the command of Stupin went to the upper Irtysh to build fortresses. Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Buholz categorically refused to lead a new expedition. In March 1717, he was sent from Tobolsk to the capital. There is very little information about the foundation of the Omsk settlement and the construction of the second fortress. One of the most valuable sources of information is the inventory of documents of the Tara Chancellery, copied for Professor G.F. Miller in 1734. This inventory was mentioned by Professor {{ill|V.I. Kochedamov|ru|Кочедамов, Виктор Ильич}} in 1960, and in 2015 it was published by the Barnaul scientists V.B. Borodaev and A.V. Kontev.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vestnik.utmn.ru/upload/iblock/01d/140_148.pdf|title=Первый сибирский губернатор М. П. Гагарин и основание русской крепости на реке Омь}}</ref> However, there are no drawings and it is not known where and how the new city (fortress) was built. From Tara to the Omsk fortress, a drawing was sent "On the structure of the Omsk fortress beyond the Omya river prison and courtyards in a line." 

In 1722, this drawing was used by the captain-engineer, Paul de Grange, in the plan's development of the fortress on the right bank of the Om. At the end of the summer of 1717, Gagarin ordered the production of six bells for the Yamyshevskaya and Omsk fortresses. Bells were made by the military department, in the amount of three pieces per fortress. According to the drawing of the Omsk fortress in 1717, there was a triangular guard redoubt at the mouth of the Om, a quadrangular fort at the crossing over the Om, and a pentagonal fortress in the yard. At the beginning of 1718, seven bells were made. Perhaps the seventh was intended for the Omsk Sloboda on the right bank of the [[Om (river)|Om]]. There is no information about whether the quadrangular fort and the triangular redoubt were built. However, it is known that the fortress (defensive structure) was built pentagonal, although not as regular as in the drawing. This is clear from the plans of 1745 and 1755. The entire settlement (Omsk fortress, including the Cossack settlement and the main defensive structure) had the shape of an irregular, broken quadrangle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bk55.ru/news/article/112417/|title=1717 год. Омские крепость и слобода}}</ref>

In 1768 Om fortress was moved. The original [[Tobolsk]] and the restored [[Tara, Omsk Oblast|Tara]] gates, along with the original German Lutheran Church and several public buildings, are left. Omsk was granted town status in 1782.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admomsk.ru/web/en/city/history|title=History of the City of Omsk|website=www.admomsk.ru}}</ref>

In 1822, Omsk became an administrative capital of Western Siberia and later in 1882 the center of the vast Steppes region (today the northern part of [[Kazakhstan]]) and [[Akmolinsk Oblast (Russian Empire)|Akmolinsk Oblast]] acquiring several churches and cathedrals of various denominations, mosques, a synagogue, the governor-general's mansion, and a military academy.<ref>''Siberia and the Exile System'' {{ISBN|978-1-108-04823-1}} p. 480</ref> But as the frontier receded and its military importance diminished, the town fell into disarray. For that reason, Omsk became a major center of the Siberian exile. From 1850 to 1854, [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] served his sentence in an Omsk [[katorga]] prison.

Inside the Omsk settlement (the city of Omsk), a military settlement - the Omsk fortress - lived on its own for approximately 150 years. By 1845, the structures of the Omsk fortress were half destroyed, which prompted the engineering department of the military department to petition for the abolition of the fortress. In 1864, the fortress was destroyed.

[[File:Железный мост Омск.jpg|thumb|right|The Iron Bridge in 1918]]
The development of the city was generated by the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway in the 1890s. This move led to the significance of Omsk as a logistic hub. Many trade companies established stores and offices in Omsk which came to define the character of the city center. British, Dutch, and German consulates were established roughly at the same time to represent their commercial interests. The pinnacle of development for pre-revolutionary Omsk was the Siberian Exposition of Agriculture and Industry in 1910. The popularity of the World Fair contributed to the image of Omsk as the "[[Chicago]] of [[Siberia]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkrussia.com/life-arts/trans-siberian-railway-visiting-omsk-entering-siberia|title=''thinkrussia.com''}}</ref>

After the [[October Revolution]], anti-Bolshevik [[White movement|White forces]] seized control of Omsk. The "[[Provisional All-Russian Government]]" was established in Omsk in 1918, headed by the Arctic explorer and decorated war hero [[Aleksandr Kolchak|Admiral Kolchak]]. Omsk was proclaimed the capital of Russia, and its central bank was tasked with safekeeping the former empire's gold reserves. These were guarded by a garrison of former Czechoslovakian POWs trapped in Siberia by the chaos of [[World War I]] and the subsequent [[Russian Revolution|Revolution]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Omsk became a prime target for the [[Red Army]], which viewed it as a major focus of their Siberian campaign and eventually forced Kolchak and his government to abandon the city and retreat along the Trans-Siberian eastward to [[Irkutsk]]. Bolshevik forces entered the city in 1919.

===Soviet period===
The Soviet government preferred the young Novonikolayevsk (later known as [[Novosibirsk]]) as the administrative center of Western Siberia, prompting the mass transfer of administrative, cultural, and educational functions from Omsk to Novonikolayevsk. This directive stunted Omsk's growth and sparked a continuing rivalry between the two cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kachaloff.narod.ru/history.htm|title=History of Omsk|website=kachaloff.narod.ru}}</ref> Omsk received a new life because of [[World War II]]. Because it was both far from the fighting and had a well-developed infrastructure, Omsk provided a perfect haven for much of the industry evacuated away from the frontlines. Contingency plans were made to transfer the provisional Soviet capital to Omsk in the event of a German victory during the [[Battle of Moscow]] (October 1941 to January 1942).<ref>[http://www.edb.gov.hk/attachment/en/curriculum-development/kla/pshe/references-and-resources/history/conflict_and_cooperation_source6_eng.pdf Lecture 3:3: “World War II” – The Battle of Moscow], ''edb.gov.hk''</ref> At the end of the war, Omsk remained a major industrial center, subsequently becoming a leader in Soviet military production.
[[File:Lenmostzakat.jpg|thumb|Leningrad bridge over the Irtysh]]

Military industries that moved to Omsk included part of the [[OKMO]] tank-design bureau in 1941, and [[S.M. Kirov Factory no. 185]] from [[Chelyabinsk]], in 1962. The Kirov Factory and [[Omsk Transmash]] design bureau (KBTM) produced [[T-80]] tanks from the 1970s, and handled the [[BTR-T]], [[TOS-1]], and the prototype [[Black Eagle tank]]. Omsk Transmash declared bankruptcy in 2002.

In the 1950s, following the development of the oil and natural gas field in Siberia, an [[oil refinery]] complex was built, along with an entire "town of oil workers", expanding Omsk northward along the [[Irtysh]]. It is currently the largest such complex in Russia. [[Gazprom Neft]], the parent company, is the largest employer in the city, wielding its tax rates as leverage in negotiations with municipal and regional authorities. The nearby parts of the city close to the complex were nicknamed '''Neftezovodskaya''' by refinery workers.

[[Omsk-Severnyy (air base)]], a Soviet then [[Russian Air Force]] base, is located nearby.

===Post-Soviet period===
[[File:Omsk Pushkin Library.jpg|thumb|right|[[Omsk State Library]]]]
Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Omsk experienced a period of economic instability and political stagnation. Most of the city's large businesses, which had been state-owned, were fought over by members of the former party elite, the emerging [[nouveau riche]], and fast-growing criminal syndicates. The most notorious cases involved the privatization of [[Sibneft]], a major oil company.  Until the end of the 1990s, political life in Omsk was defined by an ongoing feud between the oblast and city authorities. The resulting conflict developed into two points of view, which served as the impetus for some improvements to the city's infrastructure and cultural life. These improvements included the construction of new leisure parks and the renovation of the city's historic center, the establishment of the annual [[Siberian International Marathon]], and of the annual City Days Festival. Despite this, internal political competition continued to drain the city's resources and served as a major obstacle to smooth government operations and city development.

==Geography==
===Location===
Omsk is in the south of the [[West Siberian Plain]], along the banks of the north-flowing [[Irtysh River|Irtysh]], at its [[confluence]] with the [[Om River]]. The city has an elevation of {{convert|87|m|sp=us}} [[above mean sea level]] at its highest point.

Omsk is an important railroad hub and is the junction point for the northern and southern branches of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. The city also serves as a major hub for the regional highway network. River-port facilities handle both passengers and freight, giving the city access to navigating the extensive waterways of the [[Irtysh River|Irtysh]] and [[Ob River]]. The waterways connect Omsk with the coal and mineral-mining towns further up the river in [[Kazakhstan]], as well as with the [[petroleum industry|oil, natural gas]] and lumber operations of northern Siberia. Omsk is served by the [[Tsentralny Airport]], which offers access to domestic and international (primarily, German and Kazakh) destinations, making the city an important aviation hub for Siberia and the [[Russian Far East]].

It is about {{cvt|450|km}} north of Kazakhstan's capital [[Astana]], and {{cvt|600|km}} west of Siberia's largest city, [[Novosibirsk]].

===Climate===
Omsk has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb'') characterized by dramatic seasonal shifts in weather: winters are long, dry, windy and very cold, and summers are short but sunny and warm, sometimes hot. Average daily temperatures, taken over the past three decades, are between {{convert|+20|C}} for July and {{convert|-17|C|1}} for January, although temperatures can reach {{convert|+40|C}} in the summer and drop to {{convert|-45|C}} in the winter. On average, Omsk sees over 300 sunny days a year ([[List of cities by sunshine duration|2201 hours]]). The average annual [[precipitation]] is {{convert|415|mm|sp=us}}.

==Architecture==
[[File:Assumption Cathedral, Omsk.jpg|thumb|[[Omsk Dormition Cathedral]]]]

The architectural centerpiece of the city is an ensemble of buildings along Lyubinsky Avenue/Lenina Street, anchored by the former [[Gostiny Dvor]], and flanked by two chapels. The area is an eclectic mix of architectural styles, dominated by Art nouveau, Neoclassical and Second Empire.

Closer to the confluence of the Om and the Irtysh are the few surviving sombre buildings of the 18th-century fortress. The largest and most opulent church in the city is the [[Dormition Cathedral, Omsk|Dormition Cathedral]], a five-domed edifice in the [[Russian Revival]] style, consecrated in 1896, demolished by the Soviets, and restored in the first decade of the 21st century.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Omsk |url=https://tripbucket.com/dreams/dream/visit-omsk-russia/ |access-date=2023-01-31 |website=tripbucket.com |language=en}}</ref>

Another area of interest is Nikolsky Avenue-Krasnykh Zor Street, where a line of merchants' wooden houses still stands. The street leads to the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] [[St. Nicholas Cossack Cathedral|cathedral of St.&nbsp;Nicholas]], which was commissioned by the [[Cossacks]], designed by [[Vasily Stasov]] and consecrated in 1840. It contains various relics of the Siberian Cossacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rbth.com/articles/2011/09/27/omsk_garrison_city_on_the_irtysh_13048|title=Omsk: Garrison city on the Irtysh|first=William|last=Brumfield|date=September 27, 2011}}</ref>

Also, an important sigh-seen of the city is the Achair Women's Monastery in the name of the Life-giving Cross of the Lord. It is known for a mineral spring (+37 degrees) on its territory alleged to have healing properties, which was consecrated on September 14, 1993, by Patriarch [[Alexy II of Moscow]].

The new mayor Viktor Schrader (2004-2012) initially came with the governor's full support; however, in 2010, the information war unfolded again. Several pro-governor media sought the resignation of the mayor. At a press conference on 1 December 2010, Viktor Schreider said he did not intend to participate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ngs55.ru/news/77807/view/ |title=Мэр Шрейдер: «Если жители скажут, то тогда я уйду» |trans-title=Mayor Schreider: "If the residents say so, then I will leave" |date=2010-12-02 |publisher=NGS.Omsk |access-date=2010-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205055011/http://ngs55.ru:80/news/77807/view|archive-date=2010-12-05}}</ref> According to another version, the information war began in November 2009 after the primaries of the Omsk branch of the [[United Russia]] party, but the prerequisites were still in the summer of 2009;<ref>{{cite book |last=Boyko |first=M. |title=Шоу-политика на примере выборов мэра Омска в 2010 г. |trans-title=Show politics on the example of the election of the mayor of Omsk in 2010 |location=Omsk|date=2010}}</ref> as a result, the entire information war was reduced to a political game. Schreider, as a result, changed the post of mayor to the place of a deputy in the State Duma, and the acting mayor T. A. Vizhevitova was appointed in his place.

In 2012, the Omsk Oblast Governor Polezhayev, permanent since the Soviet era, resigned, and [[Viktor Nazarov]], who previously held the post of general director at CJSC Gazprom Mezhregiongaz Omsk, was appointed in his place. In the same year, early mayoral elections (due to the resignation of the previous mayor) were held, and United Russia candidate Vyacheslav Dvorakovsky, who previously served as chief engineer of the Omsk NPO Mostovik, was elected the new mayor. The information war continued, with the next round beginning during a direct line with President Putin, when an Omsk woman complained that she could not get an appointment with the Omsk mayor, and Putin publicly called Dvorakovsky a "piglet".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://regnum.ru/news/polit/1697178.html |title=Мэра-«поросёнка» единороссы могут исключить из партии (Омск) |trans-title=United Russia may expel mayor-"piglet" from the party (Omsk) |publisher=[[REGNUM News Agency]] |date=2013-08-21 |access-date=2013-08-21 |archive-date=2013-08-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823180404/http://www.regnum.ru/news/polit/1697178.html}}</ref> In March 2016, at an air show attended by more than 100,000 spectators, Nazarov ignored the mayor. BK55 correspondent Yelena Yarovaya noted that the mayor at this event was deprived of the right to speak:<ref name="Yarovaya-2016" />
{{blockquote|It turns out like this: for bad roads, unremoved snow, and landfills, we "beat" the mayor with a poor budget. And we celebrate holidays, all sorts of shows and pleasures, without a representative of the municipal government elected by Omsk residents.

Although, in poor budgets, Nazarov and Dvorakovsky, on the contrary, should have worked "in one bundle."}}

According to Vyacheslav Dvorakovsky, the information war is needed by people whose interests are to weaken both city and regional authorities, while both authorities have already successfully cooperated in solving the problem of kindergartens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://superomsk.ru/news/33416-vyacheslav_dvorakovskiy_mer_omska/ |title=Вячеслав Двораковский, мэр Омска: «Критики не понимают простой вещи, что окриками проблема не решается» |trans-title=Vyacheslav Dvorakovsky, mayor of Omsk: “Critics do not understand the simple thing that the problem is not solved by shouting” |last1=Korolkov |first1=Pavel |last2=Chernyshyova |first2=Irina |date=2016-04-04 |publisher=SuperOmsk |access-date=2016-04-07 |archive-date=2016-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408065124/http://superomsk.ru/news/33416-vyacheslav_dvorakovskiy_mer_omska/}}</ref> On 30 April 2016, during a [[prank call]] from the [[NTV (Russia)|NTV]] channel, the governor Nazarov sharply criticized Dvorakovsky for his inactivity concerning the city and unwillingness to accept help in critical communal tasks.

==Economy==
[[Gazprom]]'s [[Omsk Refinery]] is the leading employer of Omsk.

The [[Russian Air Force]] base called [[Omsk-Severnyy (air base)]] is located nearby. The [[OKMO]] tank-design bureau, the [[S.M. Kirov Factory no. 185]], the [[Omsk Transmash]] all produce weaponry. Transmash produced [[T-80]] tanks from the 1970s, and handled the [[BTR-T]], [[TOS-1]], and the prototype [[Black Eagle tank]].

Omsk is a major rail, road, and air hub. The city is served by a station on the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], and by the [[Tsentralny Airport]].  Omsk possesses a river port on the Irtysh, offering service to domestic destinations and to cities within Kazakhstan. Omsk is in [[European route E30]] (in Russia [[R254 highway (Russia)|R254 highway]]) that provides access to all of Europe.

Municipal public transportation comprises large networks of buses and trolleys along with trams, although the latter has deteriorated severely since the collapse of the USSR. ''[[Marshrutka]]s'' (shared taxis) supplement municipal transit networks.

[[Omsk Metro|A Metro system]], proposed in the late 1980s, but postponed for lack of funds, is currently under construction, with the Metro bridge over the [[Irtysh River]]. The bridge is already open for cars (upper level), but the metro (lower level) is still under construction. As a first step, one short line will connect the districts in the northwest with the city center. As of 2017, only one station is open and serves as a pedestrian subway.
