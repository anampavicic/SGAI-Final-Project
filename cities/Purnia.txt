The total geographical area of Purnia Urban Agglomeration is {{Convert|92|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|2}} which is next only to Patna. The population density of the city is 3058 persons per km sq. making it the [[List of cities in Bihar by population|4th largest city of Bihar by population]].<ref name="pop">{{cite web |title=Population of Cities in India 2021 - StatisticsTimes.com |url=https://statisticstimes.com/demographics/country/india-cities-population.php |website=statisticstimes.com}}</ref> It is nearly 315&nbsp;km from [[Patna]], as well as 171&nbsp;km from [[Siliguri]], 90&nbsp;km from [[Bhagalpur]]. It is 640&nbsp;km from [[Guwahati]] (Approx.) and 450&nbsp;km from [[Kolkata]], the capital of the adjacent state of [[West Bengal]] and the largest city in [[East India]].

==Etymology==
Several possible origins for the name ''Purnia'' have been proposed. The name may originate from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''Purna–Aranya'', which means "complete jungle".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Official Web site of Purnea Dist. Admn |url=http://purnea.bih.nic.in |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015205130/http://www.purnea.bih.nic.in/ |archive-date=15 October 2018 |access-date=2012-07-13 |publisher=Purnea.bih.nic.in}}</ref> ''Purnia'' could also be an altered form of the old name ''Purania'', derived from the word ''purain'' or [[Lotus (plant)|Lotus]], which is said to have grown on the [[Koshi River|Kosi]] and [[Mahananda River|Mahananda]] rivers.

The city's name is also [[Romanization|romanized]] as Purnea.

==History==
Purnia is part of the [[Mithila (region)|Mithila region]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Jha |first=Makhan |title=Anthropology of Ancient Hindu Kingdoms: A Study in Civilizational Perspective |year=1997 |isbn=9788175330344 |pages=27–30}}</ref> Mithila first gained prominence after being settled by [[Indo-Aryan peoples]] who established the [[Mithila Kingdom]] (also called Kingdom of the Videhas).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Witzel |first=Michael |title=Tracing the Vedic dialects in Dialectes dans les litteratures Indo-Aryennes |year=1989 |editor-last=Caillat |location=Paris |pages=13, 17 116–124, 141–143}}</ref> During the late Vedic period (c. 1100–500 BCE), Videha became one of the major political and cultural centers of [[South Asia]], along with Kuru and Pañcāla.

In the 17th century, the rulers of Purnia were involved in wars with the [[History of Limbuwan|Kings of Limbuwan]].

At the beginning of British rule, many people from Europe came to Purnia and settled here. At that time, Purnia was a complete 'Purania', meaning jungle. In the early days of colonization, Europeans settled around the [[Saura river]] in the middle of the city, now known as Rambagh area. Later, Europeans started coming west from the Saura river and making their own 'Kothi'. The civil lines existing throughout India, were also in Purnia.

Among the most active European zamindars in Purnia were Alexander John Forbes and Palmer. Alexander John Forbes bought the Sultanpur pargana from Mahajan Babu Pratap Singh of [[Murshidabad]] in 1859 and became a Zamindar. Forbes city ([[Forbesganj]]) in the Sultanpur pargana was named after him, but Forbes lived in the city of Purnia. Forbes built the race course and various other clubs. Alexander Forbes and his wife Diana died of malaria in 1890. The Forbes family sold the Sultanpur estate to the country's business house J. K. Singhania, because of the ongoing jute cultivation.

Another Englishman who lived in Purnia was Palmer. He bought the zamindari of a king and settled in Purnia. Palmer's only daughter, Mrs. Downing, was his heir. Mrs. Downing had two heirs - her son C. Y. Downing and daughter Mrs. Hays. Today, the grand residence of Hez Saheb is the main building of Purnia College. There is a dyke in Purnia, which protects the city from floods. In Baghmara, one area in the frontier of the city, there is an embankment parallel to the Saura river, which was built by Palmer. This dam was named the Palmer Dam.

Indigo cultivation was first started in Purnia by an Englishman named John Kelly. Later, many Europeans cultivated indigo here vigorously. Shillingford, a hunter, was the foremost among them who built 'Nilha Kothi' in places such as Nilganj, Mahendrapur, and Bhavbada. Neelha farmers, another group of English farmers, heavily contrubuted to Purnia's settlement. Purnia was a very green and open area.<ref>{{Cite web |title=शहरनामाः खेत पूर्णिया का जमींदार यूरोप के |url=https://aajtak.intoday.in/story/tale-of-a-city-purnea-the-land-of-purnea-and-landlords-were-from-europe-1-1156367.html |access-date=2020-07-18 |website=aajtak.intoday.in |language=hi}}</ref>

Two major rivers traverse Purnia city with the [[Kari Kosi]] river on the western end and the [[Saura river]] on the eastern end. The main city is situated between these two rivers.

==Climate==

Purnia is known for its favourable climate; it has earned the name "Mini [[Darjeeling]]" for this reason. Purnia has a largely humid climate, with the highest level of rainfall in Bihar state and humidity rising to above 70%. A cold season, from November to February, is followed by a hot season from March to June. The [[monsoon]] season begins in early June and lasts until September; 82% of its total annual rainfall falls during the monsoon season.

January, the coldest month, has a mean daily minimum temperature of 5 to 10&nbsp;°C and a mean daily maximum of 20 to 25&nbsp;°C. Wind is typically light in the non-monsoon seasons but during the monsoon, storms and depressions originating in the [[Bay of Bengal]] cause heavy rain and strong winds.

[[Purnea Airport]], also known as Chunapur Airport (Airforce Station), is located within the cantonment area but is restricted to army usage only. Proposals for the airport to operate scheduled flights are being widely discussed at the level of the state government.

The nearest commercial airport, [[Bagdogra Airport]], is about 150&nbsp;km away at [[Bagdogra]] in [[Darjeeling district]]. And [[Darbhanga Airport]] is around 231 km from Purnia. [[Jay Prakash Narayan International Airport]] (Patna Airport) is located in Patna, capital of Bihar, at a distance of 310&nbsp;km from Purnia.

===Rail===
Purnia is served by two railway stations separated by 5&nbsp;km, {{stnlnk|Purnia Junction}} (station code: PRNA) and {{stnlnk|Purnia Court}} (station code: PRNC). Purnia Junction is closer to the residents of Khuskibagh, Gulabbagh, and Eastern Purnia, while Purnia Court is in the western part of the city and caters to the residents of Madhubani, Janta Chowk, and Central and Western Purnia.
Purnia Junction is situated on [[Barauni–Katihar section|Barauni–Katihar, Saharsa and Purnia sections]] of the [[Northeast Frontier Railway]] (NFR) and [[East Central Railway zone]] that connects Purnia to {{stnlnk|Katihar Junction}}, {{stnlnk|Jogbani}}, {{stnlnk|Saharsa Junction}} and {{stnlnk|Barauni Junction}}. There are daily and weekly trains to {{stnlnk|Kolkata}}, {{stnlnk|Delhi Junction}}, {{stnlnk|Patna Junction}}, {{stnlnk|Ranchi Junction}}, {{stnlnk|Muzaffarpur Junction}}, [[Bapudham Motihari railway station|Motihari]], {{stnlnk|Lucknow Charbagh}}, {{stnlnk|Kanpur Central}}, {{stnlnk|Gorakhpur Junction}}, {{stnlnk|Gaya Junction}}, and other nearby cities.

===Road===

National Highways namely {{jct|NH|31|country=IND}}, {{jct|NH|27|country=IND}}, {{jct|NH|231|country=IND}}, {{jct|NH|131A|country=IND}} make Purnia accessible to the people from nearby cities & states while [[state highways]] connect the other neighbouring cities and villages to the main city area. The newly constructed {{jct|NH|27|country=IND}} directly connects Purnia to some important towns and cities of [[North Bihar]] namely [[Darbhanga]] & [[Muzaffarpur]]. It takes nearly 5 hours to reach [[Muzaffarpur]] through this [[Limited-access road|Expressway]]. This expressway which also traverses through the newly built Kosi Mahasetu bridge ends at [[Muzaffarpur]] to continue further for Patna. It has turned out to be an alternate route for Patna & has helped in decongesting the ever busy and traffic-prone NH31.

{{jct|NH|31|country=IND}} traverse the main city and terminate Gulab bagh at {{jct|NH|27|country=IND}} in the east and [[Patna]] to the west via [[Mokama]], [[Khagaria]] & [[Begusarai]].

The east–west corridor connecting [[Silchar]], [[Assam]] to [[Gujarat]] passes through Purnia in the form of {{jct|NH|27|country=IND}}. It is a modern four-lane highway constructed by [[National Highways Authority of India]] (NHAI). State Highways 60, 62, 65, 77 & 90 also pass through Purnia.

{{jct|NH|31|country=IND}} and {{jct|NH|27|country=IND}} are four-lane expressways and are a strength to the intercity transportation services.
