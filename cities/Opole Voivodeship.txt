'''Opole Voivodeship''' ({{langx|pl|województwo opolskie}} {{IPA|pl|vɔjɛˈvut͡stfɔ ɔˈpɔlskʲɛ||LL-Q809 (pol)-KaMan-województwo opolskie.wav}}), is the smallest and least populated [[voivodeships of Poland|voivodeship]] ([[province]]) of [[Poland]]. The province's name derives from that of the region's capital and largest city, [[Opole]]. It is part of [[Silesia]]. A relatively large [[Germans|German]] minority lives in the voivodeship, and the [[German language]] is co-official in 28 communes.

Opole Voivodeship is bordered by [[Lower Silesian Voivodeship]] to the west, [[Greater Poland Voivodeship|Greater Poland]] and [[Łódź Voivodeship]]s to the north, [[Silesian Voivodeship]] to the east, and the [[Czech Republic]] ([[Olomouc Region]] and [[Moravian-Silesian Region]]) to the south.

Opole Province's geographic location, economic potential, and its population's level of education make it an attractive business partner for other Polish regions (especially [[Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Lower Silesian]] and [[Silesian Voivodeship]]s) and for foreign investors. Formed in 1997, the [[Euroregion Praděd|Praděd/Pradziad]] [[Euroregion]] with its headquarter in [[Prudnik]] has facilitated economic, cultural and tourist exchanges between the border areas of Poland and the [[Czech Republic]].

==History==
[[File:Krainy-historyczne-Polski.png|thumb|left|Historical regions in present-day Opole Voivodeship and in Poland]]
[[File:OPna49.png|thumb|Voivodeships between 1975 and 1998 superimposed over the current borders of the Opole Voivodeship]]
The territory became part of the emerging Polish state in the 10th century, and later on, [[Brzeg]], [[Namysłów]], [[Niemodlin]], [[Opole]], [[Prudnik]] and [[Strzelce Opolskie]] were ducal seat of local lines of the [[Piast dynasty]].

Opole Voivodeship was created on January 1, 1999, out of the former Opole Voivodeship and parts of [[Częstochowa Voivodeship]], pursuant to the [[Polish local government reforms]] adopted in 1998.
Originally, the government, advised by prominent historians, had wanted to disestablish Opolskie and partition its territory between the [[Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Lower Silesian]] and [[Silesian Voivodeship]] (eastern [[Upper Silesia]] and western [[Lesser Poland]]). The plan was that Brzeg and Namysłów, as the Western part of the region, were to be transferred to Lower Silesia, while the rest was to become, along with a part of the Częstochowa Voivodeship, an integral part of the new 'Silesian' region. However, the plans resulted in an outcry from the [[German minority in Poland|German minority]] population of Opole Voivodeship, who feared that should their region be abolished, they would lose all hope of regional representation (in the proposed Silesian Region, they would have formed a very small minority among a great number of ethnic Poles). To the surprise of many of the ethnic Germans in Opole however, the local Polish Silesian population and groups of ethnic Poles also rose up to oppose the planned reforms; this came about as a result of an overwhelming feeling of attachment to the voivodeships that were scheduled to be 'redrawn', as well as a fear of 'alienation' should one find themselves residing in a new, unfamiliar region.

The solution came in late 1999, when [[Olesno]] was, after 24 years apart, finally reunited with the Opole Voivodeship to form the new legally defined region. A historic moment came in 2006 when the town of [[Radłów, Opole Voivodeship|Radłów]] changed its local laws to make German, alongside Polish, the district's second official language, becoming the first town in the region to do so.

==Geography==
The [[voivodeship]] lies in southwestern Poland, the major part on the [[Silesian Lowland]] ({{lang|pl|Nizina Śląska}}). To the east, the region touches upon the [[Silesian Upland]] ([[Silesian Uplands]], {{lang|pl|Wyżyna Śląska}}) with the famous [[Góra Świętej Anny|Saint Anne Mountain]]; the [[Sudetes]] range, the [[Opawskie Mountains]], lies to the southwest. The [[Oder River]] cuts across the middle of the voivodeship. The northern part of the voivodeship, along the [[Mała Panew]] River, is densely forested, while the southern part consists of arable land.

The region has the warmest climate in the country.

===Protected areas===
[[Protected area]]s in Opole Voivodeship include the following three areas designated as [[Landscape Park (Poland)|Landscape Parks]]:
*[[Opawskie Mountains Landscape Park]]

The Opole Voivodeship is an industrial as well as an agricultural region. With respect to [[mineral]] resources, of major importance are deposits of raw materials for building: [[limestone]] ([[Strzelce Opolskie]]), [[marl]] (near [[Opole]]), [[marble]], and [[basalt]]. The favourable [[climate]], fertile soils, and high farming culture contribute to the development of [[agriculture]], which is among the most productive in the country.

A total of nineteen industries are represented in the voivodeship. The most important are cement and lime, furniture, food, car manufacturing, and chemical industries. In 1997, the biggest production growth in the area was in companies producing wood and wood products, electrical equipment, machinery and appliances, as well as cellulose and paper products. In 1997, the top company in the region was [[Zakłady Azotowe Kędzierzyn|Zakłady Azotowe S.A.]] in [[Kędzierzyn-Koźle]], whose income was over [[Polish złoty|PLN]] 860 million. The voivodship's economy consists of more than 53,000 businesses, mostly small and medium-sized, employing over 332,000 people. Manufacturing companies employ over 89,000 people; 95.7% of all the region's business operate in the private sector.

===Tourism===
The Opole Voivodeship is a green region with three large lakes: [[Turawskie Lake|Turawskie]], [[Nyskie Lake|Nyskie]], and [[Otmuchów Lake|Otmuchów]] (the latter two are connected). The Opawskie Mountains between Prudnik and Głuchołazy are extremely popular. The region also includes [[Brzeg Castle|the castle]] in [[Brzeg]], built during the reign of the [[Piast dynasty]]—pearl of the [[Silesia]]n Renaissance, the Franciscan monastery on top of [[Góra Świętej Anny (hill)|Góra Świętej Anny]] (Saint Anne Mountain), as well as the medieval old town and defence fortifications in [[Paczków]] (referred to as the Upper Silesian [[Carcassonne]]), all designated [[Historic Monument (Poland)|Historic Monument of Poland]].<ref>{{Cite Polish law|title=Rozporządzenie Prezydenta Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej z dnia 10 grudnia 2018 r. w sprawie uznania za pomnik historii "Brzeg - Zamek Piastów Śląskich z renesansową bramą i kaplicą zamkową pod wezwaniem św.
