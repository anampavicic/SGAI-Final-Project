'''Parepare''' is a city (''kota'') in [[South Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]], located on the southwest coast of [[Sulawesi]], about {{convert|155|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the provincial capital of [[Makassar]]. A port town, it is one of the major population centers of the [[Bugis]] people. The city had a population of 129,542 people at the 2010 Census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 151,454 at the 2020 Census;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> its official estimate as at mid-2023 was 160,309 (comprising 79,753 males and 80,556 females).<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Parepare Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.7372)</ref>

[[B. J. Habibie]], the third [[President of Indonesia]], was born in Parepare.

==History==
In the early development of this plateau, there was just a thicket of bushes that had many holes on slightly sloping land, which grew wild irregularly, ranging from the northern (Cappa Edge) up to the route south from the city. As time goes by, those bushes have now become the city of Parepare.

At an early date, there were kingdoms located on Parepare - the kingdom of Suppa in the 14th century and the Bacukiki Kingdom in the 15th century.

The term "Parepare" originates from the sentence of the King of Gowa “Bajiki Ni Pare” which means “(Ports in this region) are good.” Since then, the name “Parepare” has referred to the port city. Parepare was subsequently visited by Malay people who came to trade in the region of Suppa.

Seeing the strategic position of a harbour protected by a headland on the front side, the Dutch conquered this place at the first opportunity and made it an important city in the territory of the central part of South Sulawesi.

At the time of the Dutch East Indies, in Parepare, there was a Resident Assistant and a Controlur or Gezag Hebber as Head of Government (the Dutch East Indies), while the status of the region is named the “Afdeling Parepare” which included five "Onder Afdeling" for Barru, Sidenreng Rappang, Enrekang, Pinrang and Parepare.

In each region, an Onder Afdeling Controlur was domiciled or a Gezag Hebber. Besides the Dutch East Indies government officials, the structure of the Dutch East Indies Government was also assisted by government officials and Bugis kings, namely Arung Barru in Barru, Addatuang Sidenreng in Sidenreng Rappang, Sporting Enrekang in Enrekang, Addatung Sawitto in Pinrang, while at Parepare there was Arung Mallusetasi.

This governance structure, up to the outbreak of World War II, was when the Dutch East Indies Government was overtaken around the year 1942.

== Administration ==
Parepare (city) is divided into four [[Districts of Indonesia|Districts]] (''Kecamatan''), tabulated below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and the 2020 Census,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> together with the official estimates as at mid-2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Parepare Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.7372)</ref> The table also includes the location of the district administrative centres and the number of [[administrative village]]s (all classed as urban ''kelurahan'') in each district. Bacukiki District is inland and less densely populated, while the other three districts lie along the coast and contain the urban parts of the city.
