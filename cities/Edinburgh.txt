Edinburgh is governed by the [[City of Edinburgh Council]], a unitary authority. The City of Edinburgh council area had an estimated population of {{Scottish council populations|POP=S12000036}} in mid-2021,<ref name="UK district population" /> and includes outlying towns and villages which are not part of Edinburgh proper. The city is in the [[Lothian]] region and was historically part of the [[Shires of Scotland|shire]] of [[Midlothian]] (also called Edinburghshire).

==Etymology==
{{main|Etymology of Edinburgh}}
"Edin", the root of the city's name, derives from ''{{Lang|xcb|[[Eidyn]]}}'', the name for the region in [[Cumbric]], the [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] language formerly spoken there.

From the 1770s onwards, the professional and business classes gradually deserted the Old Town in favour of the more elegant "one-family" residences of the New Town, a migration that changed the city's social character. According to the foremost historian of this development, "Unity of social feeling was one of the most valuable heritages of old Edinburgh, and its disappearance was widely and properly lamented."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Youngson |first=A J |title=The Making of Classical Edinburgh |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-85224-576-7 |page=256}}</ref>

==Geography==
===Location===

Situated in Scotland's [[Central Belt]], Edinburgh lies on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth. The city centre is {{cvt|2+1/2|mi|km}} southwest of the shoreline of [[Leith]] and {{cvt|26|mi|km}} inland, as the crow flies, from the east coast of Scotland and the [[North Sea]] at [[Dunbar]].<ref>{{Cite map |title=Geographia Atlas of the World |year=1984 |publisher=Geographia Ltd |location=London |isbn=0-09-202840-3 |page=99}}</ref> While the early burgh grew up near the prominent Castle Rock, the modern city is often said to be built on [[Hills in Edinburgh|seven hills]], namely [[Calton Hill]], [[Corstorphine Hill]], Craiglockhart Hill, [[Braid Hills|Braid Hill]], [[Blackford Hill]], Arthur's Seat and the Castle Rock,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Seven Hills of Edinburgh |url=http://www.seven-hills.org.uk/course.asp |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509080149/http://www.seven-hills.org.uk/course.asp |archive-date=9 May 2013 |access-date=28 February 2013 |publisher=[[VisitScotland]]}}</ref> giving rise to allusions to the [[seven hills of Rome]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 2003 |title=Voltaire said: Athens of the North |url=http://www.scotland.org/features/voltaire-said |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427212622/http://www.scotland.org/features/voltaire-said |archive-date=27 April 2013 |access-date=28 March 2013 |publisher=Scotland.org}}</ref>

===Cityscape===

Occupying a narrow gap between the Firth of Forth to the north and the [[Pentland Hills]] and their outrunners to the south, the city sprawls over a landscape which is the product of early volcanic activity and later periods of intensive glaciation.

[[File:View of Edinburgh from Blackford Hill 2.jpg|thumb|upright=3.2|center|View of Edinburgh from Blackford Hill]]

Edinburgh is drained by the river named the [[Water of Leith]], which rises at the Colzium Springs in the Pentland Hills and runs for {{convert|29|km|mi|order=flip}} through the south and west of the city, emptying into the Firth of Forth at Leith.<ref name="waterofleith">{{Cite web |title=Overview of the Water of Leith |url=http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst2805.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607103453/http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst2805.html |archive-date=7 June 2010 |access-date=19 April 2009 |publisher=Gazetteer for Scotland, Institute of Geography, University of Edinburgh}}</ref> The nearest the river gets to the city centre is at [[Dean Village]] on the north-western edge of the New Town, where a deep gorge is spanned by [[Thomas Telford]]'s [[Dean Bridge]], built in 1832 for the road to [[South Queensferry|Queensferry]].

Excepting the shoreline of the Firth of Forth, Edinburgh is encircled by a [[green belt]], designated in 1957, which stretches from [[Dalmeny]] in the west to [[Prestongrange]] in the east.<ref name="greenbelt">{{Cite web |date=11 August 2004 |title=Review of Green Belt policy in Scotland – Edinburgh and Midlothian |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2004/08/19785/41543 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607174737/http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2004/08/19785/41543 |archive-date=7 June 2011 |access-date=10 April 2009 |publisher=Scottish Government}}</ref> With an average width of {{cvt|3.2|km|mi|0}} the principal objectives of the green belt were to contain the outward expansion of the city and to prevent the agglomeration of urban areas.<ref name="greenbelt" /> Expansion affecting the green belt is strictly controlled but developments such as [[Edinburgh Airport]] and the [[Royal Highland Showground]] at [[Ingliston]] lie within the zone.<ref name="greenbelt" /> Similarly, suburbs such as [[Juniper Green]] and Balerno are situated on green belt land.<ref name="greenbelt" /> One feature of the Edinburgh green belt is the inclusion of parcels of land within the city which are designated green belt, even though they do not connect with the peripheral ring.

===Areas===
[[File:Edinburgh map.png|thumb|Map showing the areas of central Edinburgh]]
====Early settlements====
Edinburgh includes former towns and villages that retain much of their original character as settlements in existence before they were absorbed into the expanding city of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Edinburgh Areas |url=http://www.edinburghguide.com/areas |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115223740/http://edinburghguide.com/areas |archive-date=15 January 2013 |access-date=9 February 2013 |publisher=edinburghguide.com}}</ref> Many areas, such as [[Dalry, Edinburgh|Dalry]], contain residences that are multi-occupancy buildings known as [[tenement]]s, although the more southern and western parts of the city have traditionally been less built-up with a greater number of detached and semi-detached villas.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Edinburgh area guide |url=http://www.timeout.com/edinburgh/features/146/edinburgh-area-guide |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218202447/http://www.timeout.com/edinburgh/features/146/edinburgh-area-guide |archive-date=18 February 2013 |access-date=9 February 2013 |publisher=timeout.com}}</ref>

The historic centre of Edinburgh is divided in two by the broad green swathe of [[Princes Street Gardens]]. To the south, the view is dominated by Edinburgh Castle, built high on Castle Rock, and the long sweep of the Old Town descending towards Holyrood Palace. To the north lie Princes Street and the New Town.

The [[West End, Edinburgh|West End]] includes the financial district, with insurance and banking offices as well as the Edinburgh International Conference Centre.

====Old and New Towns====

Edinburgh's Old and New Towns were listed as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in 1995 in recognition of the unique character of the Old Town with its medieval street layout and the planned Georgian New Town, including the adjoining Dean Village and Calton Hill areas. There are over 4,500 [[Listed building (United Kingdom)|listed buildings]] within the city,<ref name="www.edinburgh.org world-heritage-site" /> a higher proportion relative to area than any other city in the United Kingdom.

The castle is perched on top of a rocky crag (the remnant of an extinct volcano) and the [[Royal Mile]] runs down the crest of a ridge from it terminating at Holyrood Palace. Minor streets (called closes or [[wynd]]s) lie on either side of the main spine forming a herringbone pattern.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Old and New Towns of Edinburgh |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/728 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120141829/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/728 |archive-date=20 January 2013 |access-date=9 February 2013 |publisher=UNESCO}}</ref> Due to space restrictions imposed by the narrowness of this landform, the Old Town became home to some of the earliest "high rise" residential buildings. Multi-storey dwellings known as ''lands'' were the norm from the 16th century onwards with ten and eleven storeys being typical and one even reaching fourteen or fifteen storeys.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Chambers |first=Robert |url=https://archive.org/details/noticesmostrema00chamgoog |title=Notices of the most remarkable fires in Edinburgh: from 1385 to 1824&nbsp;... |publisher=C. Smith & Company |year=1824 |quote=fifteen. |author-link=Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802) |access-date=9 January 2012}}</ref> Numerous vaults below street level were inhabited to accommodate the influx of incomers, particularly [[Irish migration to Great Britain|Irish immigrants]], during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The street has several fine public buildings such as St Giles' Cathedral, the [[Edinburgh City Chambers|City Chambers]] and the [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Law Courts]]. Other places of historical interest nearby are [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]] and [[Mary King's Close]]. The [[Grassmarket]], running deep below the castle is connected by the steep double terraced Victoria Street. The street layout is typical of the old quarters of many Northern European cities.

The New Town was an 18th-century solution to the problem of an increasingly crowded city which had been confined to the ridge sloping down from the castle. In 1766 a competition to design a "New Town" was won by [[James Craig (architect)|James Craig]], a 27-year-old architect.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Cruft, Kitty |title=James Craig 1739–1795: Correction of his Date of Birth |journal=Book of the Old Edinburgh Club |volume=New Series Vol. 5 |pages=103–5}}</ref> The plan was a rigid, ordered grid, which fitted in well with [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas of rationality. The principal street was to be [[George Street, Edinburgh|George Street]], running along the natural ridge to the north of what became known as the "Old Town". To either side of it are two other main streets: Princes Street and Queen Street. Princes Street has become Edinburgh's main shopping street and now has few of its [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] buildings in their original state. The three main streets are connected by a series of streets running perpendicular to them. The east and west ends of George Street are terminated by [[St Andrew Square, Edinburgh|St Andrew Square]] and [[Charlotte Square]] respectively. The latter, designed by [[Robert Adam]], influenced the architectural style of the New Town into the early 19th century.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Scottish Architects Homecoming |url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/architectsactive.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119084414/http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/architectsactive.pdf |archive-date=19 November 2011 |access-date=18 January 2011 |publisher=Historic Scotland}}</ref> [[Bute House]], the official residence of the [[First Minister of Scotland]], is on the north side of Charlotte Square.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bute House |url=http://www.edinburghguide.com/venue/butehouse |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120143843/http://edinburghguide.com/venue/butehouse |archive-date=20 January 2013 |access-date=9 February 2013 |publisher=edinburghguide.com}}</ref>

The hollow between the Old and New Towns was formerly the [[Nor Loch]], which was created for the town's defence but came to be used by the inhabitants for dumping their [[sewage]]. It was drained by the 1820s as part of the city's northward expansion. Craig's original plan included an ornamental canal on the site of the loch,<ref name="princeshist" /> but this idea was abandoned.<ref>{{Cite web |title=From monks on strike to dove's dung |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/from-monks-on-strike-to-dove-s-dung-1-881129 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513214124/http://www.scotsman.com/news/from-monks-on-strike-to-dove-s-dung-1-881129 |archive-date=13 May 2013 |access-date=9 February 2013 |publisher=scotsman.com}}</ref> Soil excavated while laying the foundations of buildings in the New Town was dumped on the site of the [[loch]] to create the slope connecting the Old and New Towns known as [[The Mound]].

In the middle of the 19th century the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] and [[Royal Scottish Academy Building]] were built on The Mound, and tunnels for the railway line between [[Haymarket railway station|Haymarket]] and [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Waverley]] stations were driven through it.

====Southside====

The Southside is a residential part of the city, which includes the districts of [[St Leonard's, Edinburgh|St Leonards]], [[Marchmont]], [[Morningside, Edinburgh|Morningside]], [[Newington, Edinburgh|Newington]], [[Sciennes]], [[The Grange, Edinburgh|the Grange]] and [[Blackford, Edinburgh|Blackford]]. The Southside is broadly analogous to the area covered formerly by the [[Burgh Muir]], and was developed as a residential area after the opening of the [[South Bridge, Edinburgh|South Bridge]] in the 1780s. The Southside is particularly popular with families (many state and private schools are here), young professionals and students (the central University of Edinburgh campus is based around [[George Square, Edinburgh|George Square]] just north of Marchmont and [[The Meadows (park)|the Meadows]]), and [[Napier University]] (with major campuses around Merchiston and Morningside). The area is also well provided with hotel and "bed and breakfast" accommodation for visiting festival-goers. These districts often feature in works of fiction. For example, [[Church Hill, Edinburgh|Church Hill]] in Morningside, was the home of [[Muriel Spark]]'s Miss Jean Brodie,<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie |url=http://www.geraldinemcewan.com/JeanBrodie.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209070917/http://www.geraldinemcewan.com/JeanBrodie.html |archive-date=9 February 2013 |access-date=9 February 2013 |publisher=geraldinemcewan.com}}</ref> and [[Ian Rankin]]'s [[Inspector Rebus]] lives in Marchmont and works in St Leonards.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Inspector Rebus Novels |url=http://www.ianrankin.net/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303085742/https://www.ianrankin.net/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=12 |archive-date=3 March 2013 |access-date=9 February 2013 |publisher=ianrankin.net}}</ref>

====Leith====

[[File:The Shore, Leith.JPG|thumb|The Shore, Leith]]

[[Leith]] was historically the port of Edinburgh, an arrangement of unknown date that was confirmed by the royal charter Robert the Bruce granted to the city in 1329.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Edinburgh Corporation |title=Edinburgh 1329–1929, Sexcentenary of Bruce Charter |publisher=Oliver And Boyd |year=1929 |location=Edinburgh |page=xxvii}}</ref> The port developed a separate identity from Edinburgh, which to some extent it still retains, and it was a matter of great resentment when the two burghs merged in 1920 into the City of Edinburgh.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Story of Leith – XXXIII.

With the redevelopment, Edinburgh has gained the business of cruise liner companies which now provide cruises to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands.

The coastal suburb of [[Portobello, Edinburgh|Portobello]] is characterised by Georgian villas, Victorian tenements, a beach and [[promenade]] and cafés, bars, restaurants and independent shops. There are rowing and sailing clubs, a restored Victorian swimming pool, and [[Victorian Turkish baths]].

====Urban area====

The [[List of towns and cities in Scotland by population#Settlements|urban area]] of Edinburgh is almost entirely within the [[The City of Edinburgh Council|City of Edinburgh Council]] boundary, merging with [[Musselburgh]] in East Lothian. Towns within easy reach of the city boundary include [[Inverkeithing]], [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]], [[Tranent]], [[Prestonpans]], [[Dalkeith]], [[Bonnyrigg]], [[Loanhead]], [[Penicuik]], [[Broxburn, West Lothian|Broxburn]], [[Livingston, West Lothian|Livingston]] and [[Dunfermline]]. Edinburgh lies at the heart of the Edinburgh & South East Scotland City region with a population in 2014 of 1,339,380.<ref name="NRS LA Estimate">{{Cite web |title=Mid-Year Population Estimates Scotland, Mid-2017 |date=19 April 2018 |url=https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files//statistics/population-estimates/mid-17/mid-year-pop-est-17-publication.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511214824/https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files//statistics/population-estimates/mid-17/mid-year-pop-est-17-publication.pdf |archive-date=11 May 2018 |access-date=12 April 2018 |website=National Records of Scotland }}</ref><ref name="City Region Definition">{{Cite web |title=Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region |url=http://www.acceleratinggrowth.org.uk/about-us/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125202249/http://www.acceleratinggrowth.org.uk/about-us/ |archive-date=25 November 2015 |access-date=25 November 2015}}</ref>

===Climate===
Like most of Scotland, Edinburgh has a cool [[temperate climate|temperate]] [[maritime climate]] (''Cfb'') which, despite its northerly latitude, is milder than places which lie at similar latitudes such as [[Moscow]] and [[Labrador]].<ref name="temperature">{{Cite web |title=Regional Climate – Eastern Scotland |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/regional-climates/es |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516005631/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/regional-climates/es |archive-date=16 May 2013 |access-date=19 April 2009 |publisher=Met Office}}</ref> The city's proximity to the sea mitigates any large variations in temperature or extremes of climate. Winter daytime temperatures rarely fall below freezing while summer temperatures are moderate, rarely exceeding {{cvt|22|C}}.<ref name="temperature" /> The highest temperature recorded in the city was {{cvt|31.6|C}} on 25 July 2019<ref name="temperature" /> at Gogarbank, beating the previous record of {{cvt|31|C}} on 4 August 1975 at Edinburgh Airport.<ref>{{Cite web |title=It's the hottest day ever – Edinburgh roasts as Capital breaks all-time temperature record |url=https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/weather/it-s-the-hottest-day-ever-edinburgh-roasts-as-capital-breaks-all-time-temperature-record-1-4971315/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725191952/https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/weather/it-s-the-hottest-day-ever-edinburgh-roasts-as-capital-breaks-all-time-temperature-record-1-4971315 |archive-date=25 July 2019 |access-date=26 July 2019}}</ref> The lowest temperature recorded in recent years was {{cvt|-14.6|C}} during December 2010 at Gogarbank.<ref>{{Cite web |date=8 December 2010 |title=December 2010 minimum |url=http://metofficenews.wordpress.com/2010/12/08/minimum-temperatures-and-snow-across-the-uk-last-night/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112235510/http://metofficenews.wordpress.com/2010/12/08/minimum-temperatures-and-snow-across-the-uk-last-night/ |archive-date=12 January 2012 |access-date=31 October 2011}}</ref>

Given Edinburgh's position between the coast and hills, it is renowned as "the windy city", with the prevailing wind direction coming from the south-west, which is often associated with warm, unstable air from the [[North Atlantic Current]] that can give rise to rainfall – although considerably less than cities to the west, such as Glasgow.<ref name="temperature" /> Rainfall is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year.<ref name="temperature" /> Winds from an easterly direction are usually drier but considerably colder, and may be accompanied by [[haar (fog)|haar]], a persistent coastal fog. Vigorous Atlantic depressions, known as [[European windstorm]]s, can affect the city between October and April.<ref name="temperature" />

Located slightly north of the city centre, the weather station at the [[Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh]] (RBGE) has been an official weather station for the [[Met Office]] since 1956.
The Met Office operates its own weather station at Gogarbank on the city's western outskirts, near [[Edinburgh Airport]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Edinburgh Gogarbank Climate Averages 1981–2010 |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate/gcvw5vmsn |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909205528/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate/gcvw5vmsn |archive-date=9 September 2015 |access-date=11 August 2015 |publisher=Met Office}}</ref> This slightly inland station has a slightly wider temperature span between seasons, is cloudier and somewhat wetter, but differences are minor.

Temperature and rainfall records have been kept at the Royal Observatory since 1764.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Niederschlagsmonatssummen EDINB.OBS./BLACKFORD 1785- 1987 |url=http://old.wetterzentrale.de/klima/pedinbu.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190105212026/http://old.wetterzentrale.de/klima/pedinbu.html |archive-date=5 January 2019 |access-date=3 July 2019}}</ref>

Edinburgh has a high proportion of young adults, with 19.5% of the population in their 20s (exceeded only by Aberdeen) and 15.2% in their 30s which is the highest in Scotland. The proportion of Edinburgh's population born in the UK fell from 92% to 84% between 2001 and 2011, while the proportion of White Scottish-born fell from 78% to 70%.

Although they account for only 2,685 people or 0.5% of the city's population, Edinburgh has the highest number and proportion of people of [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshi]] descent in Scotland. Close to 12,000 people were born in African countries (2.3% of the total population) and over 13,000 in the Americas. With the notable exception of Inner London, Edinburgh has a higher number of people born in the United States (over 6,500) than any other city in the UK.<ref name="2022census_Scot"/>

The proportion of people residing in Edinburgh born outside the UK was 23.5% in 2022, compared with 15.9% in 2011 and 8.3% in 2001. Below are the largest overseas-born groups in Edinburgh according to the 2022 census, alongside the two previous censuses.

The construction of the New Town from 1767 onwards witnessed the migration of the professional and business classes from the difficult living conditions in the Old Town to the lower density, higher quality surroundings taking shape on land to the north.

Early 20th-century population growth coincided with lower-density suburban development. As the city expanded to the south and west, detached and semi-detached villas with large gardens replaced tenements as the predominant building style. Nonetheless, the 2001 census revealed that over 55% of Edinburgh's population were still living in tenements or blocks of flats, a figure in line with other Scottish cities, but much higher than other British cities, and even central London.<ref name="dwellings">{{Cite web |title=Edinburgh Comparisons – Dwellings |url=http://download.edinburgh.gov.uk/Census_2001_City_Comparisons/CCTable4Dwellings.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318032701/http://download.edinburgh.gov.uk/Census_2001_City_Comparisons/CCTable4Dwellings.pdf |archive-date=18 March 2009 |access-date=8 February 2009 |publisher=City of Edinburgh Council}}</ref>

From the early to mid 20th century, the growth in population, together with slum clearance in the Old Town and other areas, such as [[Dumbiedykes]], [[Leith]], and [[Fountainbridge]], led to the creation of new estates such as [[Stenhouse, Edinburgh|Stenhouse]] and [[Saughton]], [[Craigmillar]] and [[Niddrie, Edinburgh|Niddrie]], [[Pilton, Edinburgh|Pilton]] and [[Muirhouse]], [[Piershill]], and [[Sighthill, Edinburgh|Sighthill]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=A BRIEF HISTORY OF EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND |url=http://www.localhistories.org/edinburgh.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117002911/http://localhistories.org/edinburgh.html |archive-date=17 January 2013 |access-date=9 February 2013 |publisher=localhistories.org}}</ref>

After the 2017 election, the SNP and Labour formed a coalition administration, which lasted until the next election in 2022. The [[2022 City of Edinburgh Council election]] resulted in the most politically balanced council in the UK, with 19 SNP, 13 Labour, 12 Liberal Democrat, 10 Green and 9 Conservative councillors. A minority Labour administration was formed, being voted in by Scottish Conservative and Scottish Liberal Democrat councillors. The SNP and Greens presented a coalition agreement, but could not command majority support in the council. This caused controversy amongst the Scottish Labour Party group for forming an administration supported by Conservatives and led to the suspension of two Labour councillors on the council for abstaining on the vote to approve the new administration.<ref>{{Cite web |date=28 June 2022 |title=Labour suspends councillors who abstained on vote that put their party into power |url=https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/politics/council/two-edinburgh-labour-councillors-suspended-after-abstaining-on-vote-which-put-their-party-into-power-3748068 |access-date=17 August 2022 |website=www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com |language=en}}</ref> The city's [[Coat of arms of Edinburgh|coat of arms]] was registered by the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] in 1732.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Urquhart |first=R M |title=Scottish Burgh and County Heraldry |publisher=Heraldry Today |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-900455-24-7 |location=London |page=9}}</ref>
