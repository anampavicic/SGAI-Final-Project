'''Río Gallegos''' ({{IPA|es|ˈri.o ɣaˈʝeɣos|}}) is the capital and largest settlement of the [[Patagonia]]n [[provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Santa Cruz Province (Argentina)|Santa Cruz]] in [[Argentina]]. Located in the department of [[Güer Aike Department|Güer Aike]], it has a population of about 98,000, according to the {{census-ar|2010}}, a 24% increase from the 79,000 in the {{census-ar|2001}}. The city bears the name of the [[Gallegos River]], and sits on its [[estuary]] {{cvt|2636|km|mi|0}} south from the Argentine federal capital [[Buenos Aires]].

Established on 19 December 1885 to increase Argentine power over southern Patagonia, Río Gallegos became the capital of the then Territory of Santa Cruz in 1888, retaining its status when the territory became a province in 1957. [[Néstor Kirchner]], later [[President of Argentina]], served as the city's mayor from 1987 to 1991 and is interred in a [[Mausoleum of Néstor Kirchner|mausoleum]] in the city's cemetery.

==History==
{{see also|Patagonian sheep farming boom}}
In 1525 Spanish explorer [[García Jofre de Loaísa]] became the first European to reach the Gallegos River, and named it ''Río San Idelfonso''. Simón de Alcazaba y Sotomayor's 1535 expedition was the first to name the river ''"Río Gallegos"''. The area was not settled by Europeans until much later, with the settlement established 19 December 1885, when the Argentine government wished to better express its sovereignty over southern [[Patagonia]] – a naval base was created which increased the development of the town. Between 1912 and 1920, the government encouraged settlers from the [[Falkland Islands]] and southern [[Chile]] with preferential farming conditions. Some 3,000 arrived and boosted the town. As [[sheep]]-farming increased, Río Gallegos became the principal port for exporting sheep and their products. The Pioneers Museum is a preserved old Patagonian house exhibiting the life of the early settlers.

Governor [[Ramón Lista]] decided to move the Territorial Capital from [[Puerto Santa Cruz]] to Río Gallegos in 1888; official ratification of this decision came on 19 May 1904. The Cathedral of Our Lady of Luján was consecrated in 1900. The Territory of Santa Cruz was declared a [[Provinces of Argentina|Province]] in 1957, with Mario Cástulo Paradelo as its first Governor.

In the 1982 [[Falklands War]], the [[Piloto Civil Norberto Fernández International Airport|city airport]] was base of [[Argentine Air Force]] [[Mirage III]] interceptors and [[A-4 Skyhawk]]s strike aircraft.

[[Néstor Kirchner]], President of Argentina from 2003 to 2007, was mayor of Río Gallegos between 1987 and 1991. His mausoleum is in the city and a street bears his name.

Today, Río Gallegos is an important city of the Argentine far south, with military bases and an [[Piloto Civil Norberto Fernández International Airport|international airport]]. Flights between Chile and [[RAF Mount Pleasant|Mount Pleasant Airport]] on the Falkland Islands stop at Río Gallegos once a month.

==Wildlife==

Birds in the area include the [[Turdus falcklandii|thrush]], [[rhea (bird)|rhea]], ''chingolo'' ([[rufous-collared sparrow]]), [[Chilean flamingo]], [[upland goose]] and [[black-necked swan]]. [[Grey fox]]es are predators on the sheep ranched in the city. Other animals found in the area include the [[guanaco]].

On the outskirts of Rio Gallegos there is a wide variety of native plants, including [[Berberis microphylla|calafates]], [[Anarthrophyllum|anartrofilos]], [[oxalis]], [[violet (plant)|violets]] and [[pansy|pansies]], [[Bougainvillea glabra|paper flowers]], [[calceolaria]]s, hipoqueris, [[Marticorenia|leucerias]], [[Perezia (plant)|perezias]], [[senecio]]s, mata arrears, senecio miser, [[Alstroemeria|amancay]], [[Lilium|lilies]], lily of the field.

==Sport==
Rio Gallegos' main association football club is [[Boca Rio Gallegos]] of the [[Torneo Argentino B]], the fourth tier of Argentine football. Founded 12 October 1945 by meat factory workers, the side share their crest and kit with [[Boca Juniors]] of Buenos Aires, Argentina's most successful club, and have played in the national league system since 1988.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bocariogallegos.com/ |title=急速快3官网_首页 |website=www.bocariogallegos.com |access-date=2012-10-13 |archive-date=2018-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321070058/http://bocariogallegos.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
