'''Jinhua'''{{efn|{{Audio|Jin1hua2.ogg|}}; alternately romanized as '''Kinhwa'''}} is a [[prefecture-level city]] in central [[Zhejiang]] province in [[eastern China]]. It borders the provincial capital of [[Hangzhou]] to the northwest, [[Quzhou]] to the southwest, [[Lishui]] to the south, [[Taizhou, Zhejiang|Taizhou]] to the east, and [[Shaoxing]] to the northeast. Its population was 7,050,683 as of the 2020 census including 1,463,990 in the built-up (or metro) area made of two urban districts (not including yet the satellite city of [[Lanxi, Zhejiang|Lanxi]], which has become essentially a suburban offshoot of Jinhua's main urban area).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/china/zhejiang/admin/|title=China: Zhèjiāng (Prefectures, Cities, Districts and Counties) - Population Statistics, Charts and Map}}</ref>

Jinhua is rich in [[Ultisols|red soil]] and forest resources. The Jinhua or Wu River flows through the Lan and Fuchun to the [[Qiantang River]] beside [[Hangzhou]], which flows into [[Hangzhou Bay]] and the [[East China Sea]]. In medieval China, it formed part of the water network feeding supplies to the southern end of the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]]. It is best known for its dry-cured [[Jinhua ham]].

==History and culture==
The history of Jinhua dates back to the 2nd century BC, when it was a county subordinate to [[Shaoxing]]. It was given the name Jinhua under the [[Sui dynasty]] in AD 598 and later became the seat of a [[prefecture]]. The present city and its walls date to the [[Yuan dynasty]] in 1352.

The most famous native of Jinhua is [[Huang Chuping]], a [[Daoism|Daoist]] holy man of the 4th century and reputed [[xian (Taoism)|immortal]] whose descendants still live in the area. [[Wuyang Shan]] ("Reclining Sheep Mountain") is said to be a sheep which was turned to stone by Huang, a trick which he learned through his years of diligently studying Daoism.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Economically Jinhua has always prospered from its position as the regional collecting and processing center for agricultural and forestry products (chiefly rice and bamboo). It is currently the second most important grain producing area in [[Zhejiang]]. In 1985 Jinhua was promoted to City status, and now is responsible for administering four cities, four counties and a district. Animals raised there include dairy cattle, meat hogs (for the production of [[Jinhua ham]], a famous local product for 900 years) and honeybees. Jinhua's industrial sector has developed more recently, producing machinery, metallurgy, pharmaceuticals, building supplies and electrical and electronic equipment.

The [[Tang dynasty]] painter [[Guan Xiu]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.whittier.edu/academic/english/Chinese/Guanxiu.htm |title=Guan Xiu |access-date=2011-04-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526160219/http://web.whittier.edu/academic/english/Chinese/Guanxiu.htm |archive-date=2011-05-26 }}</ref> (Kuan-hsiu) was born in Jinhua. He is known for his paintings of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] holy men.

There are numerous scenic and historical sites in the Jinhua region, including many places associated with the Immortal Huang, and a palace of the Dukes of the
[[Taiping Rebellion|Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]].

== Architecture ==
Jinhua architecture, also known as Wu-school architecture, is a style of traditional Chinese architecture that is characterized by large apartments, large courtyards, large open halls, horse-head walls. This style is different from the [[courtyard house]]s in Beijing and the [[earth building]]s in [[Fujian]].

Representative of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] Dynasty residences, Jinhua architecture typically features a clear central axis and a symmetrical layout. These buildings were often constructed by the royal family or the descendants of [[Confucianism]], and served as both living spaces and cultural artifacts that reflect the values and beliefs of Confucianism.

The common characteristic of Confucian inheritance is the emphasis on respecting teachers, education, law, and rules. This philosophy is reflected in the spatial design and construction of Jinhua architecture. These houses are built with a harmonious balance between [[Yin and yang|Yin]] and [[Yin and yang|Yang]] and embody symmetry and balance.

==Economy==
