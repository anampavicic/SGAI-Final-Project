'''Kukawa''' ([[Kanuri language|Kanuri]] for "[[Baobab]]s"), formerly  '''Kuka''' ("Baobab"), is a town and [[local government areas of Nigeria|Local Government Area]] in the northeastern [[Nigeria]]n state of [[Borno State|Borno]], close to [[Lake Chad]].

The town was founded as Kuka in 1814 by [[Shehu of Borno|Shehu]] [[Muhammad al-Amin al-Kanemi]] of the [[Bornu Empire]]. He intended for it to serve as his capital after the fall of the previous capital, [[Ngazargamu]].<ref name=kemper/> The town was the end of one of the main [[trans-Saharan trade]] routes to [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]] on the [[Mediterranean]] coast.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xh-QcHRG3OwC&pg=PA16 |title=The Cambridge History of Africa, Volume 6 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |editor=J.

Historically the town was much larger than today, with a population estimated by the British at 50,000-60,000 in the late nineteenth-century. In the 19th-century, the expansion of a extramural suburb on the Dendal, the town's main road, caused the settlement to function as two towns, Kuka Futebe (Kanuri: "West Town") and Kuka Gedibe ("East Town").<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Kirk-Greene |first=A.

The towns were captured and sacked in 1893 by the [[Sudan]]ese warlord [[Rabih az-Zubayr]], and then by the [[British Empire|British]] in 1902.
 
On 16 January 2015, "caretaker chairman of Kukawa Local Government Area, Musa Alhaji Bukar Kukawa", speaking on behalf of the Kukawa residents who were displaced to [[Maiduguri]] following the [[2015 Baga massacre]], "called on the federal government to [[Islamist insurgency in Nigeria|intensify military operations]] so that they can return to their homes."<ref>Hamza Idris and Yahaya Ibrahim.
