'''Khurja''' is a city (and a [[municipal board]]) in [[Bulandshahr district]] in the Indian [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. It is situated around 20 km from [[Bulandshahr]] and 85&nbsp;km from [[Delhi]]. Khurja supplies a large portion of the ceramics used in the country, hence it is sometimes called ''The Ceramics City''.

The name ''Khurja'' is derived from the [[Urdu]] word ''kharija'' meaning, ''cancelled'' or ''condemned'', as the revenue for this town was waived because this land included many swamps and the agricultural possibilities were rare.

== History ==
The history of [[Khurja pottery]] goes back to around 14th century, when some retreating (wounded) soldiers and commanders from [[Timur]]'s army decided to remain. They had officially established Khurja as a town. These men were mainly from the imperial [[Kheshgi|Kheshgi Dynasty]] of the [[Mughal Empire]], descendants of the [[Kheshig]]s, who were senior officials throughout the [[Mughal Empire|Empire]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0cuAQAAIAAJ&q=kheshgi+khurja&pg=PA297|title=Imperial Gazetteer of India ...|date=1908|publisher=Clarendon Press|language=en}}</ref>

A number of these soldiers were potters and they brought this craft with them. Starting with red clay pottery they moved on to blue glaze and on red clay articles with a white [[engobe]], painted floral designs with cupric oxide and applying a soft glaze containing glass and borax etc.

During World War II, ban was imposed on various metals for making household utensils and import of ceramic goods was drastically curtailed. To meet the demand of ceramic wares mainly for war hospitals, the Government of Uttar Pradesh established a ceramic unit. After the war, the factory was closed in 1946 due to lack of demand of its products. The factory was equipped with three small kilns, two chimneys and three ball mills. Instead of closing the factory completely the Government of Uttar Pradesh converted it into a Pottery Development Centre.

== Industry ==
{{unsourced section|date=September 2024}}
The development activities of U.P. Small Industrial Corporation Ltd. resulted in setting up of UPSIC Potteries Ltd. in 1976–77. There was a widespread complaint about the efficiency of the UPSIC Potteries Ltd., primarily because of high costs. The Government of Uttar Pradesh set up a panel in Nov.1990 to examine the working of the corporation and to consider the proposal of the passing of the commercial activities back to the Pottery Development Centre (Local Office of Directorate of fisheries.)

Since there are often power cuts lasting around eight hours, all factories and most homes have private generators. The municipality water supply is insufficient or everybody's need so many have water pumps to extract groundwater.
