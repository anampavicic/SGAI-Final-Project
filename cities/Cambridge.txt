The first [[Town charter#Municipal charters|town charters]] were granted in the 12th century, although modern city status was not officially conferred until 1951.

The city is well known as the home of the [[University of Cambridge]], which was founded in 1209 and consistently ranks among the best universities in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |title=QS World University Rankings 2023: Top Global Universities |url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2023 |access-date=8 June 2022 |website=Top Universities |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8793862/What-it-takes-to-make-it-to-Oxbridge.html |title=What it takes to make it to Oxbridge |first=Richard |last=Cairns |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |date=1 October 2011 |access-date=26 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518151853/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8793862/What-it-takes-to-make-it-to-Oxbridge.html |archive-date=18 May 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The buildings of the university include [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge|King's College Chapel]], [[Cavendish Laboratory]], and the [[Cambridge University Library]], one of the largest legal deposit libraries in the world. The city's skyline is dominated by several [[Colleges of the University of Cambridge|college buildings]], along with the spire of the [[Our Lady and the English Martyrs Church]], and the chimney of [[Addenbrooke's Hospital]]. [[Anglia Ruskin University]], which evolved from the Cambridge School of Art and the Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology, also has its main campus in the city.

Cambridge is at the heart of the high-technology [[Silicon Fen]] or [[List of technology centers|Cambridge Cluster]], which contains industries such as [[Software industry|software]] and [[bioscience]] and many start-up companies born out of the university. Over 40 per cent of the workforce have a higher education qualification, more than twice the national average. The [[Cambridge Biomedical Campus]], one of the largest biomedical research clusters in the world, includes the headquarters of [[AstraZeneca]] and the relocated [[Royal Papworth Hospital]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-25197143 |title=Papworth heart and lung specialist hospital to move |date=3 December 2013 |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=20 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926193731/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-25197143 |archive-date=26 September 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Cambridge produced the first 'Laws of the Game' for [[association football]] and was the site of the first game, which was held at [[Parker's Piece]]. The [[Strawberry Fair]] music and art festival and Midsummer Fair are held on [[Midsummer Common]], and the annual [[Cambridge Beer Festival]] takes place on [[Jesus Green]]. The city is adjacent to the [[M11 motorway|M11]] and [[A14 road (England)|A14]] roads.

=== Early-industrial era ===
In the 19th century, in common with many other English towns, Cambridge expanded rapidly, due in part to increased life expectancy and improved agricultural production leading to increased trade in town markets.<ref name="british-history-66609">{{cite book |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66609 |chapter=The city of Cambridge: Economic history |editor-first=J.

The railway came to Cambridge in 1845 after initial resistance, with the opening of the [[Great Eastern Railway]]'s London to Norwich line.

During [[World War II]], Cambridge was an important centre for defence of the east coast. The town became a military centre, with an [[R.A.F.]] training centre and the regional headquarters for [[Norfolk]], [[Suffolk]], [[Essex]], [[Cambridgeshire]], [[Huntingdonshire]], [[Hertfordshire]], and [[Bedfordshire]] established during the conflict.<ref name="british-history-66605" /> The town itself escaped relatively lightly from German bombing raids, which were mainly targeted at the railway. 29 people were killed and no historic buildings were damaged. In 1944, a secret meeting of military leaders held in Trinity College laid the foundation for the allied invasion of Europe.<ref name="british-history-66609" /> During the war Cambridge served as an [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuation centre]] for over 7,000 people from London, as well as for parts of the [[University of London]].<ref name="british-history-66605" />

Cambridge was granted its [[city status in the United Kingdom|city charter]] in 1951 in recognition of its history, administrative importance and economic success.<ref name="british-history-66605" /> Cambridge does not have a cathedral, traditionally a prerequisite for city status, instead falling within the Church of England [[Diocese of Ely]].

The city gained its second university in 1992 when Anglia Polytechnic became Anglia Polytechnic University. Renamed [[Anglia Ruskin University]] in 2005, the institution has its origins in the Cambridge School of Art opened in 1858 by [[John Ruskin]].

The University of Cambridge formerly had two seats in the House of Commons; Sir [[Isaac Newton]] was one of the most notable MPs.

The [[River Cam]] flows through the city from the village of [[Grantchester]], to the southwest. It is bordered by [[water meadows]] within the city such as [[Sheep's Green]] as well as residential development.<ref name="www.cambridge.gov.uk-2016" /> Like most cities, modern-day Cambridge has many suburbs and areas of high-density housing. The city centre of Cambridge is mostly commercial, historic buildings, and large green areas such as Jesus Green, [[Parker's Piece]] and [[Midsummer Common]]. Some of the roads in the centre are pedestrianised.

The town's river link to the surrounding agricultural land, and good road connections to London in the south meant Cambridge has historically served as an important regional trading post. King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] granted Cambridge a monopoly on river trade, privileging this area of the economy of Cambridge.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Story of Cambridge |first=Stephanie |last=Boyd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-62897-6|year=2005}}</ref> The town [[Market Hill, Cambridge|market]] provided for trade in a wide variety of goods and annual trading fairs such as [[Stourbridge Fair]] and [[Midsummer Fair]] were visited by merchants from across the country.

Cambridge and its surrounds are sometimes referred to as [[Silicon Fen]], an allusion to [[Silicon Valley]], because of the density of high-tech businesses and [[business incubator|technology incubators]] that have developed on [[science park]]s around the city.

In 2024, Cambridge Connect proposed repurposing the planned route of the canceled metro as a [[light railway]]. Known as the [[Isaac Newton line]], it would connect the mainline railway stations with Cambourne, the guided busway station at [[Trumpington]], Haverhill, [[Addenbrookes Hospital]], and a new station in Cambridge city centre.<ref>[https://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/cambridge-news/calls-5million-government-put-cambridge-29736365 Isaac Newton line]</ref>

The city is home to [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]], who play at the [[Abbey Stadium]]. Formed in 1912 as Abbey United, they were elected to the [[English Football League|Football League]] in 1970 and reached the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1978, although a serious decline in them in the mid-1980s saw them drop back down to the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] and almost go out of business. Success returned to the club in the early 1990s when they won two successive promotions and reached the [[FA Cup]] quarter finals in both of those seasons and, in 1992, they came close to becoming the first English team to win three successive Football League promotions which would have taken them into the newly created [[FA Premier League]]; however, they were beaten in the play-offs and another decline set in. In 2005, they were relegated from the Football League and, for the second time in twenty years, narrowly avoided going out of business. After nine years of non-league football, they returned to the Football League in 2014 by winning the [[Conference National]] play-offs.
