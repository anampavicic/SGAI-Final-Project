Mary Musgrove often served as an interpreter. The city of Savannah and the colony of Georgia were founded on that date. In 1751, Savannah and the rest of Georgia became a [[Royal Colony]], with Savannah as its capital.<ref name="Savannah">{{New Georgia Encyclopedia|id=h-1056|name=Savannah|author=|date=|accessdate=}}</ref>

By the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]], Savannah had become the southernmost commercial port in the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. British troops [[Capture of Savannah|took the city]] in 1778, and the following year, a combined force of American and French soldiers, including Haitians, failed to rout the British at the [[Siege of Savannah]]. The British did not leave the city until July 1782.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/siege-of-savannah-during-the-american-revolutionary-war.htm|title=Siege of Savannah During the American Revolutionary War|work=History Net: Where History Comes Alive – World & US History Online|date=June 12, 2006|access-date=1 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926064629/http://www.historynet.com/siege-of-savannah-during-the-american-revolutionary-war.htm|archive-date=September 26, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> In December 1804 the state legislature declared [[Milledgeville, Georgia#History|Milledgeville]] the new capital of Georgia.

Savannah, a prosperous seaport throughout the nineteenth century, was the Confederacy's [[Confederate States of America#Rural and urban population|sixth most populous city]] and the prime objective of General [[William T. Sherman]]'s [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]. On December 21, 1864, local authorities negotiated a peaceful surrender to save Savannah from destruction, and Union troops marched into the city at dawn.<ref>Jacqueline Jones, ''Saving Savannah: The City and the Civil War'' (New York: Alfred Knopf, 2008), 206.</ref>

Savannah was named after the Savannah River, which probably derives from variant names for the [[Shawnee]], a Native American people who migrated to the river in the 1680s. The Shawnee destroyed another Native people, the [[Westo]], and occupied their lands at the head of the Savannah River's navigation on the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]], near present-day [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Cashin |first= Edward J. |title= Colonial Augusta: "Key of the Indian Countrey" |year= 1986 |publisher= Mercer University Press |isbn= 978-0-86554-217-4 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tWSQXKCfGbwC&pg=PA4 |page= 4 |access-date= October 17, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160102160334/https://books.google.com/books?id=tWSQXKCfGbwC&pg=PA4 |archive-date= January 2, 2016 |url-status= live }}</ref> These Shawnee, whose Native name was ''Ša·wano·ki'' (literally, "southerners"),<ref>"Shawnee", in ''Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'', 11th ed., 1145</ref> were known by several local variants, including Shawano, Savano, Savana and Savannah.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uga.edu/coastalnemo/Documents/GRN/savannah.pdf|title=Savannah River Basin|publisher=Georgia River Network|access-date=October 12, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925081203/http://www.uga.edu/coastalnemo/Documents/GRN/savannah.pdf|archive-date=September 25, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Another theory is that the name Savannah refers to the extensive marshlands surrounding the river for miles inland, and is derived from the English term "[[savanna]]", a kind of tropical grassland, which was borrowed by the English from Spanish ''sabana'' and used in the [[Southern Colonies]].

==Geography==
Savannah lies on the Savannah River, approximately {{convert|20|mi|abbr=on}} upriver from the Atlantic Ocean.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/jeo300/savanna1.htm |title=Part 1: Visit to Savannah |publisher=Georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu |date=1996-04-29 |access-date=2012-12-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121215045217/http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/jeo300/savanna1.htm |archive-date=December 15, 2012 }}</ref> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]] (2011), the city has a total area of {{convert|108.7|sqmi|km2|1}}, of which {{convert|103.1|sqmi|km2|1}} is land and {{convert|5.6|sqmi|km2}} is water (5.15%). Savannah is the primary port on the Savannah River and the largest port in Georgia. It is also near the [[Intracoastal Waterway|U.S. Intracoastal Waterway]]. Georgia's [[Ogeechee River]] flows toward the Atlantic Ocean some {{convert|16|mi|km}} south of downtown Savannah and forms the southern city limit.

Savannah is prone to flooding due to abundant rainfall, an elevation just above sea level, and the shape of the coastline, which poses a greater surge risk during hurricanes. The city currently uses five canals. In addition, several pumping stations have been built to help reduce the effects of flash flooding.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.savannahga.gov/508/Stormwater-Management|title=Stormwater Management {{!}} Savannah, GA – Official Website|website=www.savannahga.gov|access-date=2019-01-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190130053747/https://www.savannahga.gov/508/Stormwater-Management|archive-date=January 30, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Climate===
Savannah's climate is classified as [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''). Throughout the Deep South, this is characterized by long and almost tropical summers and short, mild winters. Savannah records only a few days of freezing temperatures each year, and snowfall is rare. Due to its proximity to the Atlantic coast, Savannah rarely experiences temperatures as extreme as those in Georgia's interior. Nevertheless, the extreme temperatures have officially ranged from {{convert|105|°F|0}}, on July 20, 1986, and July 12, 1879, down to {{convert|3|°F|0}} during the [[January 1985 Arctic outbreak]].<ref name="NWS Charleston, SC (CHS)"/><ref name= TWC >{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USGA0506?from=36hr_bottomnav_undeclared|title=Average Weather for Savannah, GA – Temperature and Precipitation|publisher=The Weather Channel|access-date=December 6, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424025443/http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USGA0506?from=36hr_bottomnav_undeclared|archive-date=April 24, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>

Seasonally, Savannah tends to have hot and humid summers with frequent (but brief) thunderstorms that develop in the warm and tropical air masses, which are common. Although summers in Savannah are frequently sunny, half of Savannah's annual precipitation falls from June through September. Average dewpoints in summer range from {{convert|67.8|to|71.6|F|0}}. Winters in Savannah are mild and sunny with average daily high temperatures of {{convert|61.4|°F|0}} in January. November and December are the driest months recorded at Savannah–Hilton Head International Airport. Each year, Savannah reports 21 days on average with low temperatures below freezing, though in some years, fewer than 10 nights will fall below freezing, and the city has even gone an entire winter season (1879–80) without recording a freeze.<ref name="NOAA">{{cite web |url = https://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=chs |title = NowData – NOAA Online Weather Data |publisher = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |access-date = June 11, 2022}}</ref> Although decades might pass between snowfall events, Savannah has experienced snow on rare occasions, most notably [[December 1989 United States cold wave|in December 1989]], when up to {{convert|3.9|in|cm}} was recorded in one day in parts of the city.<ref name="NWS Charleston, SC (CHS)"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb|title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map|access-date=July 9, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712002910/http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMweb/|archive-date=July 12, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Savannah is at risk for [[hurricanes]], particularly of the [[Cape Verde hurricane|Cape Verde]] type of storms that take place during the peak of the season. Because of its location in the [[Georgia Bight]] (the arc of the Atlantic coastline in Georgia and northern Florida) as well as the tendency for hurricanes to re-curve up the coast, Savannah has a lower risk of hurricanes than some other coastal cities such as [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. Savannah was seldom affected by hurricanes during the 20th century. [[Hurricane David]], in August 1979, is a notable exception.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.savannahnow.com/article/20090904/NEWS/309049815|title=Hurricane David, 30 years after the storm|last=Mobley|first=Chuck|website=Savannah Morning News|language=en|access-date=2019-01-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190130055411/https://www.savannahnow.com/article/20090904/NEWS/309049815|archive-date=January 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> However, the historical record shows that the city was frequently affected during the second half of the 19th century. The most prominent of these storms was the [[1893 Sea Islands hurricane]], which killed at least 2,000 people.

The first meteorological observations in Savannah probably occurred at [[Oglethorpe Barracks]] circa 1827, continuing intermittently until 1850 and resuming in 1866. The Signal Service began observations in 1874, and the [[National Weather Service]] has kept records of most data continually since then; since 1948, [[Savannah-Hilton Head International Airport]] has served as Savannah's official meteorological station. Annual records (dating back to 1950) from the airport's weather station are available on the web.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weather-warehouse.com/WeatherHistory/PastWeatherData_SavannahIntlArpt_Savannah_GA_January.html|title=Weather History for Savannah, GA [Georgia] for January|publisher=Weather-warehouse.com|access-date=1 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305164101/http://weather-warehouse.com/WeatherHistory/PastWeatherData_SavannahIntlArpt_Savannah_GA_January.html|archive-date=March 5, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Squares===
{{Main|Squares of Savannah, Georgia}}
Savannah is noted for its 22 squares and small parks along five historic streets running north to south. Each street has between three and five squares. The squares vary in size and character, from the formal fountain and monuments of the largest, [[Johnson Square (Savannah, Georgia)|Johnson]], to the playgrounds of the smallest, [[Crawford Square (Savannah, Georgia)|Crawford]]. Elbert, [[Ellis Square (Savannah, Georgia)|Ellis]], and Liberty Squares are classified as the three "lost squares" destroyed in the course of urban development during the 1950s. Elbert and Liberty Squares were paved over to make way for a realignment of U.S. Route 17, while Ellis Square was demolished to build the [[City Market (Savannah, Georgia)|City Market]] parking garage. The city restored Ellis Square after razing the parking garage. The garage was rebuilt as an underground facility, the Whitaker Street Parking Garage, and opened in January 2009. The restored Ellis Square opened in March 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialsavannahguide.com/ellis-square |title=Ellis Square in Savannah |access-date=2021-08-25 |publisher=Official Savannah Guide }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pps.org/great_public_spaces/one?public_place_id=609|title=Squares of Savannah|access-date=2009-07-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305044537/http://www.pps.org/great_public_spaces/one?public_place_id=609|archive-date=March 5, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Conn |first=Lesley |date=2009-01-23 |url=https://www.savannahnow.com/story/news/2009/01/23/city-celebrates-whitaker-street-garage-next-phase-ellis-square/13602370007/ |access-date=2009-07-21 |title=City celebrates Whitaker Street garage; next phase at Ellis Square |newspaper=[[Savannah Morning News]] and Evening Press }}</ref> Separate efforts are now underway to revive Elbert and Liberty Squares.

[[Franklin Square (Savannah, Georgia)|Franklin Square]] is the site of Savannah's Haitian Monument, which commemorates the heroic efforts of the [[Chasseurs-Volontaires de Saint-Domingue]] in the 1779 Siege of Savannah and for an independent America.

Chippewa Square honors the [[Battle of Chippawa]] during the [[War of 1812]]. It features a large [[James Oglethorpe Monument|statue of James Oglethorpe]], the city's founder. In popular culture, the square is the location of the park bench seen in the 1994 film ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' from which the title character dispenses wisdom to others waiting for a bus.<ref name="Smiths">{{cite news |last1=Geiling |first1=Natasha |title=Visit These Iconic Forrest Gump Filming Locations |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/forrest-gumps-america-180951933/ |access-date=30 January 2020 |publisher=Smithsonian Magazine |date=3 July 2014}}</ref>

Also located in Savannah are the [[Mordecai Sheftall Cemetery]] and the [[Levi Sheftall Family Cemetery]], which both date back to the second half of the eighteenth century.

===Historic forts===
[[Fort James Jackson|Fort Jackson]] (named for the Georgia politician [[James Jackson (Georgia politician)|James Jackson]], not [[Andrew Jackson]]) lies on the Savannah River, one mile east of Savannah's Historic District. Built between 1808 and 1812 to protect the city from attack by sea, it was one of several [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forts defending Savannah from Union forces during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. [[Fort Pulaski National Monument]], located on Cockspur Island, {{convert|17|mi|km}} east of Savannah, preserves the largest fort protecting the city during the war. The [[Union Army]] bombarded [[Fort Pulaski]] in April 1862 with the aid of a new [[rifling|rifled]] [[cannon]].
