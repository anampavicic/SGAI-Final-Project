It is the main city of the [[Metropolitan Region of Vale do Paraíba e Litoral Norte]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.al.sp.gov.br/leis/legislacao-do-estado/|title=Lei Complementar nº 1.166, de 09 de janeiro de 2012|website=www.al.sp.gov.br|accessdate=17 July 2023}}</ref> A native of São José dos Campos is called a ''joseense'' ({{IPA|pt|ʒozɛˈẽsi}}). Being the second most populous non-capital city in Brazil – behind [[Campinas]] – São José dos Campos lies in the middle of the [[Expanded Metropolitan Complex]] ("Complexo Metropolitano Expandido"), the first [[megalopolis]] in the Southern Hemisphere, with over  thirty million inhabitants. The city's metro area also includes [[Greater São Paulo]], [[Campinas]], [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]] and [[Sorocaba]].
The municipality concentrates many major companies and  industries, such as [[Embraer]], [[Panasonic]], [[Johnson & Johnson]], [[Ericsson]], [[Philips]], [[General Motors]], [[Petrobras]], [[Monsanto]] among others. São José dos Campos also holds relevant education and research institutions, as [[Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica|ITA]], [[National Institute for Space Research|INPE]], [[CEMADEN]], [[IEAv]], {{ill|Instituto de Aeronáutica e Espaço|pt|lt=IEA}}, {{ill|Instituto de Fomento e Coordenação Industrial|pt|lt=IFI}}, [[UNESP]], [[UNIFESP]], [[Department_of_Aerospace_Science_and_Technology|DCTA]], [[FATEC]], [[UNIVAP]] and [[IP%D]], holding a position the puts the city as the main and largest Aerospacial Complex in Latin America. Thus, it is also considered the warlike producer centre. The [[Technological Park]] ("Parque Tecnológico de São José dos Campos"), the largest one in the country, is the only research institute in the world that converges all the three top global plane production companies, [[Embraer]], [[Boeing]] and [[Airbus]].

=== Metropolitan Area ===
The intense conurbation process has been creating a metropolis whose center city is São José dos Campos, reaching many other municipalities like [[Jacareí]], [[Taubaté]], [[Aparecida]], [[Caçapava]], [[Guaratinguetá]], [[Campos do Jordão]], [[Caraguatatuba]], [[Pindamonhangaba]] and [[Lorena, São Paulo|Lorena]]. The [[Paraíba Valley|Paraíba Valley metropolitan area]] is currently made up of 39 cities, comprehending 2 453 387 inhabitants. 
The metro area is part of the [[São Paulo Macrometropolis|Expanded Metropolitan Complex]], being a megalopolis that connects [[São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]], encompassing São José dos Campos and [[Campinas]] with over 30 million inhabitants as a total number.

=== Cityscape ===
[[File:Sjregions.GIF|right|350px]]
The municipality comprises three districts: São José dos Campos&nbsp;— the city itself, (also the seat), [[Eugênio de Melo]] and [[São Francisco Xavier]]. The last one is known for its natural sites and [[ecotourism]].

The district of São José dos Campos is also subdivided into 2 subdistricts (São José dos Campos and Santana do Paraíba).

However, for administrative purposes, the city is composed of 7 urban regions: Center, North, South, West, East, Southeast and São Francisco Xavier.

=== Topography ===
[[Highland (geography)|Highlands]] predominate in the northern region of the municipality with altitudes ranging from {{convert|660|to|975|m|abbr=on}}. The northern border of the municipality lies over the Serra da Mantiqueira Mountains (''Mantiqueira Range''), with some peaks reaching over 2000 meters (6500&nbsp;ft.). The highest point in the municipality is known as 'Pico do Selado' at an altitude of 2082 meters.

In the urban area, there are rolling plateaus and hills.
The lowest elevation in the city (and also in the municipality) is found in the ''Paraíba do Sul'' River, at a mean elevation of 550 m.

The municipality is bounded at the south by the 'Serra do Jambeiro' mountains, with an elevation of about 900m. Due to the high topographic differences among neighborhoods and the urbanization, the city now experiences [[micro-climates]] present in distant areas. The downtown tends to concentrate frequent urban heat islands, while the suburb areas get noticeably colder main temperatures. As the northern part of the city, mainly the district of [[Sao Francisco Xavier]], mescles high attitudes and ecologically preserved areas the climate is better classified as Humid Subtropical Climate ("Cwb").

The climate of the city can be, perhaps, best described as a mix between the subtropical climate of southern parts of the [[Climate of Brazil|country]], the tropical climate of most of the country and the [[subtropical highland]] climate (in Portuguese: clima tropical de altitude) of neighbouring mountainous regions.

Technically, the city has a [[humid subtropical climate]] with significant less precipitation during winters (transitioning between ''Cfa'' and ''Cwa'' climatic types in the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen classification]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/brag/v66n4/22.pdf |title=Climatic classification in São Paulo State |publisher=Instituto Agronômico de Campinas |access-date=September 11, 2016|language=pt}}</ref>). Winters are very mild, with average temperature in the coldest month near 17&nbsp;°C. Summers are not excessively hot, with average temperature of the hottest month of 24&nbsp;°C.
Frosts are very rare, happening on average once per decade. However, fogs are pretty usual, occurring mostly during the winters.  
The peaks at the northern border of the municipality (some over 2000 m high) due to altitude have colder Cwb/Cfb climates, with very occasional snowfalls.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.monteverdemg.com.br/vm-clima.htm|title = Vm-clima}}</ref>

With [[global warming]] it is very likely that the city's climate will transition in the near future (or has already transitioned) to a true tropical climate (type 'Aw' in the Köppen climate classification).

== History ==

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
The origins of São José dos Campos lie at the end of the 16th Century when Jesuits founded a cattle farm, ''Aldeia do Rio Comprido''. The farm was created through a concession of settlements around 1590 to the [[Society of Jesus]]. The farm was located on the banks of the Rio Comprido, natural division between São José and the city of [[Jacareí]] today.

The farm status was an artifice to hide a religious outpost, one of the several [[Jesuit Reductions]] in Brazil, known for their resistance to enslavement, from the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] expedition leaders and indigenous people hunters, known as the [[Bandeirantes]].

On September 10, 1611, the local was officially recognized and the farmers precluded from utilizing the Natives as [[slaves]]. However, a [[turmeric]] conflict between farmers and the religious led to the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1640 from the region and the consequent dispersion of the mission.

Nevertheless, the Jesuits returned and reestablished a new settlement, where the current city center is spotted. It was about {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} northeast of the previous mission, on a higher plain with a privileged view above a geological depression, which guaranteed security against invasions and floods. Again, despite being a new mission, it was officially treated as a cattle farm.

The initial urbanization plan is attributed to the Jesuit priest [[Manoel de Leão]], whose main occupation was really to be an administrator of the community.

In 1692, documents named the village as ''Residência do Paraíba do Sul''; in 1696 as ''Residência de São José''.

At the beginning of the gold mining economic cycle in Brazil, the settlement goes through serious difficulties due to the exit of labor to the mines.

After the definitive [[Suppression of the Jesuits#Portugal|expulsion of Jesuits from the Portuguese Empire]] in 1759, all the religious order's assets, such as farms, colleges and villages were taken under the Portuguese Crown's custody. The governor, D. [[Luis Antonio Botelho Mourão]], had as a priority to turn these new assets into productive units and increase tax collection. For that, Boutelho Mourão successfully requested authorization from the [[Viceroy]] to create [[civil parishes]], known as ''[[freguesias]]'', and to change the fiscal status of villages to the category of Vila (town).

Then, on July 27, 1767, São José reached the official status of town, with a [[town hall|hall]] and a [[pillory]], passing over the status of civil parish; and the name '''Vila de São José do Paraíba''' was formalized. But for many years it maintained the same rural characteristics. The main difficulty was the fact that the ''Estrada Real'' (Royal Road) passed by its limits, far from the village.

=== Cotton and coffee ===
In the middle of the 19th century, the village of São José do Paraíba had demonstrated some signs of economic growth through the development of agriculture. Cotton production evolved rapidly in the region, exported to the English textile industry. The production reached a peak in 1864.

In the same year, on April 22, the town became the seat of a municipality, acquiring finally, in 1871, the current name of '''São José dos Campos''', followed by the creation of a [[judiciary district]]  in 1872. Almost simultaneously, there was development of coffee crops in [[Vale do Paraiba|Paraíba Valley]], which started to take off in 1870.

In 1886, after the opening of the [[Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil]] railway (1877), the coffee production peaked. Then started to decay, running steady until the 1930s.

=== Hydro-mineral retreat and industrialization ===
[[File:Inauguração_da_Fábrica_da_General_Motors_em_São_José_dos_Campos_(SP)_pelo_Presidente_Juscelino_Kubitschek.tif|thumb|Inauguration of the General Motors Factory in São José dos Campos by President [[Juscelino Kubitschek]], 1959.]]The call for the municipality of São José dos Campos for the treatment of pulmonary [[tuberculosis]] by [[sanatorium]]s became noticed at the beginning of last century, due to its supposedly favorable climate conditions. The city became known as ''the Sanatorium City''. The country's then-largest hospital, the Vicentina Aranha Sanitarium, was opened in town in 1924, and in 1935 the municipality was officially recognized as a health retreat.

With the advent of [[antibiotics]] in the 1940s, tuberculosis begins to be treated anywhere, thus ending the healthcare advantage carried out by São José, whereas the establishment of industries was about just to start.

The industrialization process of the municipality takes hold from the installation of the ''[[Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica|Technological Institute of Aeronautics]] '' in 1950 and also with the opening of the Dutra Highway (BR-116), thus making possible a faster connection between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo and cutting into the urban area of São José dos Campos. Altogether, these factors allowed the municipality to make strides towards fulfilling its scientific and technological potential.

== Government ==
São José dos Campos has a "strong mayoral" system in which the mayor is vested with extensive executive powers, as it is in all municipalities in Brazil. The mayor is elected to a four-year term by universal voting. The City Council is elected every four years with the mayor. 

=== The state administrative region of São José dos Campos ===
[[File:sjcvale.gif|right|250px]]
The [[State of São Paulo]] is divided politically and administratively into 15 regions. São José dos Campos is the seat and the name of the 3rd Administrative Region, which includes the North Coast of São Paulo state and the Paraíba Valley.

The region comprises 39 municipalities with sharp contrasts. São José dos Campos is a densely populated city, with approximately 2,100 inhabitants/square kilometers in urban area, whereas the quiet municipality of São José do Barreiro has only seven inhabitants/square kilometer. {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} There are both highly industrialized cities and the others in the region are focused on agriculture and tourism. São José dos Campos is well known as the ''Capital do Vale'' which means that São José dos Campos is the most important city of the Paraíba Valley.

It is one of the state's most dynamic areas, the fourth one in terms of population density, and covers 11.3% of the state's territory. The main municipalities are São José dos Campos, [[Taubaté]], [[Jacareí]], [[Guaratingueta]], [[Caraguatatuba]], [[Campos do Jordão]], [[São Sebastião, São Paulo|São Sebastião]], [[Lorena, São Paulo|Lorena]], [[Pindamonhangaba]], [[Ubatuba]] and [[Caçapava]].

== Entertainment, leisure and sports ==
Although São José is an industrial center, the city still preserves green areas and quiet town districts. Around 62% of the area from the municipality is characterized as an environmental preservation area. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}} On the outskirts of the urban area, [[Augusto Ruschi]] Ecology Reserve has many local plant species. The [[natural reserve]] has {{convert|2,500,000|m2|abbr=on}}, being a government protect area for the local [[flora]]. São Francisco Xavier is a community the offers many of those attributes as well.

Furthermore, there is an easy access to the mountain cities (Campos do Jordão, Santo Antônio do Pinhal) and to the beaches of the [[Microregion of Caraguatatuba|Northern Coast of São Paulo]], being both of the areas in a distance of only 80&nbsp;km from São José dos Campos.

The city has three major parks and several sports and country clubs. Tenis Clube and Associação Esportiva São José have hosted the 35th [[Banana Bowl]] [[International Tennis Federation]] Juniors Circuit in 2005 and 2006. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

A soccer stadium, called [[Estádio Martins Pereira]], is the home ground of [[São José Esporte Clube]], a professional soccer team.

{{wide image|São josé dos campos.jpg|1000px|São José dos Campos.}}

The city has two bus stations, having lines to cities in all regions of the country and international routes to [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Chile]].

São José dos Campos boasts an extensive bus system. Operated by three companies (Expresso Maringa, Julio Simões and Viação Capital do Vale), these lines serve nearly all areas in the city with 319 buses. São José dos Campos also has an alternative system with minivans to supplement the regular buses.

The city uses a [[ring road]] system, that interconnects it to important national and state highways:

*[[Brazilian Highway System|BR-116]] (federal highway), which crosses the urban area of São José. It runs in a north–south direction in the country, near but not on Brazil's coastline. The section that connects Rio de Janeiro to São Paulo is known as Presidente Dutra. It is widely used inside the urban area of São José dos Campos for commuting purposes;
*[[Rodovia Carvalho Pinto|SP-070]] (state highway) also known as Rodovia Carvalho Pinto which connects [[São Paulo]] to [[Taubaté]];
*[[Rodovia Dom Pedro I|SP-065]] Connects São Jose dos Campos to [[Campinas]]
*[[Rodovia dos Tamoios|SP-099]] (state highway) also known as Rodovia dos Tamoios which connects São José to the coastal lowlands of the city of [[Caraguatatuba]];
[[File:Tamoios.JPG|thumb|right|[[SP-099|Tamoios Highway]]]]
*[[SP-050]] (state highway) – the old road which connects São José dos Campos to [[Campos do Jordão]] and the southern region of [[Minas Gerais]].

The city is also served by a railway (the former [[Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil|Central do Brasil]]), administered by [[MRS Logística]], which today only carries freight.

The ports of [[São Sebastião, São Paulo|São Sebastião]] and [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]] can be reached by the highways SP-099, SP-155, and BR-101. The transportation of cargo to the domestic and foreign markets is made through both ports.
[[File:Aeroporto de são josé dos campos.jpg|thumb|right|[[São José dos Campos Airport]]]]
The [[São José dos Campos Airport]] ([[IATA]]: SJK, [[ICAO]]: SBSJ) has a heavy passenger flow, mainly business trips during weekdays, and it is an important connection between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. With a {{convert|3000|m|abbr=on}} runway, the airport also serves people who come to visit the tourist city of Campos de Jordão. The airlines [[Azul Brazilian Airlines]] and [[TRIP Linhas Aéreas]] fly from São José dos Campos to several destinations and presently are the only commercial airlines operating on São José dos Campos.

It is also used for the transportation of cargo from the several industries located in the so-called Cone Leste Paulista ("São Paulo's East Cone"). [[Infraero]] and the Federal Revenue Agency are also introducing a new concept called airport-industry, that will offer fiscal incentives and fast importation and exportation procedures. The municipality has also a Customs Station for the Hinterland (dry port), controlled by the Federal Revenue Agency.

São José dos Campos receives [[natural gas]] from two gas [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], and large companies such as General Motors, Kodak, Monsanto and Embraer are among the main users. The city is the third largest in the country referring to the distribution net of natural gas for residential use. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== Communication ===
In telecommunications, the city was served by [[:pt:Companhia_Telefônica_Brasileira|Companhia Telefônica Brasileira]] until 1973, when it began to be served by [[:pt:Telecomunicações_de_São_Paulo|Telecomunicações de São Paulo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imprensaoficial.com.br/DO/BuscaDO2001Documento_11_4.aspx?link=/1973/ineditoriais/abril/24/p1/pag_0054_DUI6O3SN7V5CNe7E7ANSRTTG04F.pdf&pagina=54&data=24/04/1973&caderno=Ineditoriais&paginaordenacao=100054|title=Creation of Telesp - April 12, 1973|access-date=2024-05-27|website=www.imprensaoficial.com.br|language=Portuguese}}</ref> In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the [[Vivo (telecommunications company)|Vivo]] brand in 2012.<ref name=":vivo" />

=== Service industry ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
Since the 1990s, the local economy has been evolving in a different direction. The manufacturing economy has been downsized or replaced by [[tertiary sector of industry|tertiary]] and [[quaternary sector of industry|quaternary]] sectors of industries.

For instance, the Entrepreneurial District of Chacaras Reunidas concentrates companies of micro, small and medium size, which are mainly the result of downsizing from old large local industries. Although most of these are industries, these companies provide service as well.

Two technological parks and five (one in project) [[business incubators]] have been created within universities or with industrial facilities.

There are incubators with technological start-up companies installed at Univap and at Henrique Lage [[Oil refinery|Refinery]] of [[Petrobrás]]. The CTA houses other incubator, Incubaero, specialized in the aeronautical field.

Univap features a technological park with capacity for around 40 small to medium-sized innovating companies in the areas of [[Chemical substance|materials]], [[electronics]] and [[telecommunications]], [[information technology]], [[aerospace]], [[energy]], [[Natural environment|environment]] control, [[biotechnology]], [[bioinformatics]], [[chemical engineering]], and [[software]] among others. A new technological park, managed by the municipality and the state government of São Paulo, will house two new [[think tanks]]: the Institute for Technological Research (IPT) and the ItecBio (Instituto de Tecnologias Biomédicas).

As a result of its geographical location, the city became an important distribution center, having several [[logistics]] providers. Activities like purchasing, transport, planning and warehousing have employed many people recently.

Commerce and real estate ventures have developed in the last years, reflecting the changes in the economy. For instance, the largest shopping mall in the region was an old manufacturing facility. Serving the region's population of approximately one million, the city is the regional hub for shopping and services for the [[Vale do Paraíba]], the northern coast of São Paulo and southern [[Minas Gerais]].
