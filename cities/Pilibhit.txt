'''Pilibhit''' is a city and a [[municipal board]] in [[Pilibhit district]] in the northern Indian [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Pilibhit is the north-easternmost district of [[Bareilly division]], situated in the [[Rohilkhand]] region of the sub-[[Terai|Himalayan Plateau]] belt next to foothills of [[Sivalik Range]] on the boundary of [[Nepal]], known for the origin of river [[Gomti River|Gomati]] and one of the most forest-rich areas in [[North India]]. Pilibhit was also known as ''Bansuri Nagari'' – the land of flutes, for making and exporting roughly 95% of India's flutes.<ref name=PilibhitasBansuriNagari>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/in-varun-country/443157/0|title=Pilibhit as Bansuri Nagari|access-date=24 January 2010|work=The Indian Express|date=5 April 2009}}</ref>

== History ==
Pilibhit forests area are a home for the striped cats, tiger, bear, and many species of birds. A proposal, created in 2005, to make a home for the endangered cats in Pilibhit forests was sent to the government of India in April 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=39098|title=Untitled Page|access-date=25 August 2019|archive-date=3 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234723/http://www.pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=39098|url-status=live}}</ref>  was declared in September 2008 based on its special type of [[ecosystem]] with vast open spaces and sufficient feed for the elegant predators.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/Pilibhit-tiger-reserve-gets-Central-nod/articleshow/3469118.cms | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021190524/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-09-11/lucknow/27936945_1_tiger-reserve-dudhwa-reserve-dudhwa-tigers | url-status=live | archive-date=2012-10-21 | work=[[The Times of India]] |title = Pilibhit tiger reserve gets Central nod}}</ref>

It is believed by locals that Pilibhit was ruled by an ancient king named Mayurdhwaj or Moredhwaj or King Venu, a great devotee of lord [[Krishna]] and a loyal friend of [[Arjuna|Arjun]].  King Venu's name and the geography of his kingdom can be traced in the Hindu epic ''[[Mahabharat]]''.<ref name=KingdomofKingVenu>{{cite web|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V20_144.gif|title=Kingdom of King Venu|access-date=12 May 2009|publisher=Government of India|archive-date=27 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327070552/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V20_144.gif|url-status=live}}</ref>

The city Pilibhit was an administrative unit in the [[Mughal era]] under Bareilly suba.  For security, the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] subedar [[Ali Mohammed Khan]] constructed four magnificent gates around the administrative building in 1734&nbsp; AD. These gates were named ''Barellwi Darwaza'' at the west, ''Hussaini Darwaza'' at the east, ''Jahanabadi Darwaza'' at the north and ''Dakhini Darwaza'' at the south.  Because of a lack of proper maintenance, all the gates have been lost; only their ruins remain. He also constructed a [[Jama Masjid]] in Pilibhit.<ref name=RuinofPilibhit>{{cite web|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/sho/1996/00000039/00000004/art00019|title=Ruin of Pilibhit|access-date=10 November 2007|publisher=Brill's Indological Library, Leiden: E.J.

==Geography==
Pilibhit lies between the parallels of 28°64' and 29°53' north latitude and the meridians of 79°57' and 81°37' east longitude covering an area of 68.76&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. The north side of Pilibhit is bordered by [[Udham Singh Nagar]] district of [[Uttarakhand]] state and by the territory of Nepal. [[Shahjahanpur]] lies on the south side Pilibhit. The east of Pilibhit is flanked for a short distance by [[Lakhimpur Kheri]] and the remaining distance is swathed by the Shahjahanpur. The western limit touches the limits of [[Bareilly]].

According to the [[Central Statistical Organisation]], the district Pilibhit had an area of 3504&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> on 1 September 2007, occupying 46th position in the state <!-- what does this mean? what does "position" refer to?-->and the total area of the Pilibhit city is 68.76&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.  Pilibhit city, with 2365.11 people per square kilometre, is more densely populated than the rest of the district, which has 469.51 people per km<sup>2</sup>.

The area has diverse features, and topographically may be divided into several distinct tracts. In the north and north-west, the tract is a continuation of the Terai. The southern portion of the [[Bisalpur, Pilibhit|Bisalpur]] tehsil is similar in most respect to the adjacent tract of Bareilly and Shahjahanpur. The eastern and smaller section approximates rather to undeveloped forest areas of Lakhimpur Kheri, though with the spread of cultivation the dissimilarity between [[Puranpur]] and the rest of the area is gradually becoming less marked. There are 1216 [[Villages in the district Pilibhit|villages]] within Pilibhit's limits, of which 982 are electrified.<ref name=Electrifiedvillageinpilibhit>{{cite web |url= http://www.uppcl.org/uppcllink/documents/07042009032423table4_2.htm |title= Electrified Villages in Pilibhit |access-date= 24 January 2010 |publisher= Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100331193756/http://www.uppcl.org/uppcllink/documents/07042009032423table4_2.htm |archive-date= 31 March 2010 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> [[File:Agricultural And Forestry Science Center Pilibhit.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Agricultural and forestry science center, Pilibhit]] The area has more than ten small to medium-sized rivers and nine small to medium-sized water bodies. The origin of river [[Gomti]], ''Gumti'' or ''Gomati'' ({{Lang-hi|गोमती}}), which is a [[tributary]] of the [[Ganges River]], is from a small lake, ''Gomat Taal'', situated in [[Madhotanda]] in the Puranpur Tehsil region.<ref name=Gomatigoesmissing >{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/True-lie-Gomati-goes-missing/articleshow/1924395.cms|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021204454/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-08-25/lucknow/27818452_1_gram-pradhan-gomati-varanasi|url-status=live|archive-date=21 October 2012|title=Gomati goes missing|access-date=25 August 2006|first1=Rajeev|last1=Dikshit|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=25 August 2006}}</ref>

Pilibhit city also has a few water bodies in its limits, one being on [[Tanakpur]] road in front of the Dramond college gate, another being at the Chauraha degree college. Every year during winter, the Chauraha water body attracts thousands of [[migratory bird]]s. The main source of water in the district is the groundwater and the canals. District Pilibhit is swathed by a big net of canals. The district has six main feeders or canals, which run through almost 138&nbsp; km in the district.
The northeastern boundary of the reserve is the [[Sharda River]] (Nepali: Mahakali River) which defines the Indo-Nepal border, while the southwest boundary is marked by the River Sharda and the [[River Ghaghara]].

Studies reveal that the poverty level in the district is associated with the social identity, source of livelihood, landless and level of education of the head of the household. Education is a crucial instrument for raising income levels of people and moving out of the vicious circle of poverty. A study done by [[Delhi]]-based NGO, Nav Bharat Nirman indicates a strong correlation between educational attainment and poverty levels among various social classes in the district. The incidence of poverty is much higher among [[Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes|scheduled castes (SC) and scheduled tribes (ST)]] households in Pilibhit. Nearly 60 percent of SC households were below the [[poverty line]] in Pilibhit in 1999–2000. However, this proportion came down to 45.23 percent in 2007–08.<ref name=PopulationUnderPovertyLine>{{cite web|url=http://www.ansiss.org/doc/seminar2007July20–22/a_k_singh.doc |title=Population Under Poverty Line |access-date=21 July 2007 |publisher=A N Sinha Institute of Social Studies |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216001414/http://www.ansiss.org/doc/seminar2007July20 |archive-date=16 December 2013 }}</ref>

==Etymology==
According to the ''[[Imperial Gazetteer of India]]'', Pilibhit was once known as Hafizabad after the Rohila leader of the area, [[Hafiz Rahmat Khan]], but later took its current name from a nearby village.<ref name=Pilibhitbefore1763>{{cite web|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V20_150.gif|title=Pilibhit known as Hafizabad before 1763|access-date=12 May 2009|publisher=Government of India|archive-date=27 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327070422/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V20_150.gif|url-status=live}}</ref> According to a document from the [[British Library]], 'the city Pilibhit' existed in the late 18th century (1770–1780) when [[Maratha]]s invaded the [[Rohilkhand]] region. With this invasion, the [[Kurmi]] community came to this region and over time, the city Pilibhit enlarged it boundaries.<ref name=PilibhitLocals>{{cite web|url=http://banjaratimes.com/18022/18127.html?|title=History of Banjaras|access-date=15 July 2008|publisher=Prof Motiraj Rathod|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607044951/http://www.banjaratimes.com/18022/18127.html|archive-date=7 June 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Another evidence of the city's existence is found in [[Nepali language|Nepali]] literature, which mentions a city named as Pilibhit, which provided shelter to the last king of the [[Shah dynasty]], Deepa Shah, who was attacked by the [[Gorakha]] king in 1789 AD.<ref name=AdvancedHistoryofNepal>{{cite web|url=http://www.indus-intl.com/bookdetails.cfm?bookid=IN-02404 |title=Advanced History of Nepal |access-date=20 January 2005 |publisher=T.R.

Earlier, there was an unbroken narrow-gauge line running from [[Silchar]], in Assam, via [[Bihar]], and into Pilibhit. On this line, 60-strong bundles of bamboo, each stalk 10&nbsp; ft long, used to make their way to Pilibhit, but around 15 years ago, sections of that line were removed. Now, the bamboo has to travel on the narrow gauge from Silchar to Jiribum, then shift onto a broad-gauge line to travel to Bareilly, the nearest big town, and then reloaded onto narrow gauge to come into Pilibhit.<ref name=Historyofflute>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?sectionName=HomePage&id=7b13fd7a-8c19-4ee3-8172-af3a1ae6c334&ParentID=28e33c69-d913-4568-bad0-bf1d1e4b247d&Headline=At+Pilibhit%2c+the+oldest+symbol+of+harmony+faces+decay|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130125112827/http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?sectionName=HomePage&id=7b13fd7a-8c19-4ee3-8172-af3a1ae6c334&ParentID=28e33c69-d913-4568-bad0-bf1d1e4b247d&Headline=At+Pilibhit,+the+oldest+symbol+of+harmony+faces+decay|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 January 2013|title=History of flute|access-date=22 April 2009|publisher=The Hindustan Times News Paper}}</ref>
