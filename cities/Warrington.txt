'''Warrington''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɒr|ɪ|ŋ|t|ən}}) is an [[industrial town]] in the [[Borough of Warrington|borough of the same name]] in [[Cheshire]], England. The town sits on the banks of the [[River Mersey]] and is [[Historic counties of England|historically]] part of [[Lancashire]]. It is {{convert|19|mi|km}} east of [[Liverpool]], and {{convert|18|mi|km}} west of [[Manchester]].

The population in 2021 was recorded as 174,970 for the built-up area and 210,900 for the wider borough,<ref name=urbanpop/><ref name=boroughpop>{{cite web |title=Population and household estimates, England and Wales: Census 2021 |url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/bulletins/populationandhouseholdestimatesenglandandwales/census2021 |website=Office for National Statistics |access-date=12 January 2024}}</ref> the latter being more than double that of 1968 when it became a [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new town]]. The population of Warrington stood at 211,200 <ref>{{cite web | url=https://totalpopulation.co.uk/authority/warrington | title=Warrington Population (2024) - Total Population }}</ref> people as of 22 April 2024. Warrington is the largest town in the ceremonial county of Cheshire.

Warrington was founded by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] at an important crossing place on the River Mersey. A new settlement was established by the [[Saxons|Saxon]] Wærings.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Allen|first=Grant|url=http://archive.org/details/anglosaxonbritai01alle|title=Anglo-Saxon Britain|date=1910|publisher=New York, E.

The expansion and urbanisation of Warrington coincided with the [[Industrial Revolution]], particularly after the Mersey was made navigable in the 18th century. The [[West Coast Main Line]] runs north to south through the town, and the Liverpool to Manchester railway (the [[Cheshire Lines Committee|Cheshire Lines]] route) west to east. The [[Manchester Ship Canal]] cuts through the south of the borough (west to east). The [[M6 motorway|M6]], [[M56 motorway|M56]] and [[M62 motorway]]s form a partial box around the town and are all accessible through Warrington.

The modern Borough of Warrington was formed in 1974 with the amalgamation of the former [[County Borough of Warrington]], part of the [[Golborne Urban District]], the [[Lymm Urban District]], part of the [[Runcorn Rural District]], the [[Warrington Rural District]] and part of the [[Whiston Rural District]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Warrington}}

===Early history===
Warrington has been a major crossing point on the [[River Mersey]] since ancient times and there was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Human settlement|settlement]] at [[Wilderspool]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hinchcliffe|first1=J.|last2=Williams|first2=J.H.|title=Roman Warrington: Excavations at Wilderspool 1966–9 & 1976, Brigantia Monograph No 2|publisher=Manchester University|year=1992}}</ref> Local archaeological evidence indicates that there were also Bronze Age settlements.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} In [[medieval]] times Warrington's importance was as a market town and bridging point of the River Mersey.

===English Civil War===
Warrington was a fulcrum in the [[English Civil War]]. The armies of [[Oliver Cromwell]] and the [[James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]] both stayed near the old town centre (the [[St Elphin's Church, Warrington|parish church]] area). Popular legend has it that Cromwell lodged near the building which survives on Church Street as the Cottage Restaurant. The [[Marquess of Granby|Marquis of Granby]] public house bears a plaque stating that the [[James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]] 'had his quarters near this site'. Dents in the walls of the parish church are rumoured to have been caused by the [[cannon]]s from the time of the civil war. On 13 August 1651 Warrington was the scene of the last Royalist victory of the civil war when Scots troops under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and [[David Leslie, Lord Newark]], fought Parliamentarians under [[John Lambert (general)|John Lambert]] at the [[Battle of Warrington Bridge (1651)|Battle of Warrington Bridge]].

===Industrial history===
The expansion and urbanisation of Warrington largely coincided with the Industrial Revolution, particularly after the Mersey was made navigable in the 18th century. As Britain became industrialised, Warrington embraced the Industrial Revolution becoming a manufacturing town and a centre of steel (particularly wire), textiles, brewing, tanning and chemical industries. The navigational properties of the River Mersey were improved, canals were built, and the town grew yet more prosperous and popular. When the age of steam came, Warrington naturally welcomed it, both as a means of transport and as a source of power for its mills.

===Second World War===
Warrington was the location of the [[RAF Burtonwood|Burtonwood RAF base]] and [[ROF Risley|Risley Ordnance Factory]]. During [[World War II]], RAF Burtonwood served as the largest [[US Army Air Force]] airfield outside the United States, and was visited by major American celebrities including [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Bob Hope]] who entertained the [[G.I. (military)|GI]]s.  The RAF station continued to be used by the USAAF and subsequently USAF as a staging post for men and material until its closure in 1993.

===Post-war expansion===
Warrington was designated a [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new town]] in 1968 and consequently the population grew in size, with many of the town's new residents moving from [[Liverpool]] or [[Manchester]], with the [[Birchwood, Cheshire|Birchwood]] area being developed on the former [[ROF Risley]] site. New [[council housing]] was built for families rehousing from [[Slum clearance in the United Kingdom|slum clearance]]s in Liverpool or Manchester, while Warrington's new private housing estates also became popular with homeowners.

Heavy industry declined in the 1970s and 1980s but the growth of the new town led to a great increase in employment in light industry, retail, distribution and technology.

===IRA bombing===
{{Main|Warrington bombings}}
On 20 March 1993, the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) detonated two bombs in Warrington town centre. The blasts killed two children: three-year-old Johnathan Ball died instantly, and twelve-year-old Tim Parry, from the Great Sankey area, died five days later in hospital.  Around 56 other people were injured, four seriously.  Their deaths provoked widespread condemnation of the organisation responsible.  The blast followed a bomb attack a few weeks earlier on a gas-storage plant in Warrington.

Tim Parry's father, Colin Parry, founded [[The Tim Parry Johnathan Ball Foundation for Peace]] (known as the Peace Centre) as part of a campaign to reconcile communities in conflict. The centre opened on the seventh anniversary of the bombing, 20 March 2000.  He and his family still live in the town.

===Other history===
In 1981, Warrington was the first place to field a candidate for the new [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]]: former Home Secretary [[Roy Jenkins]] stood for Parliament but lost to [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate [[Doug Hoyle, Baron Hoyle|Doug Hoyle]] by a small number of votes.

There was a [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] training camp at [[Padgate]], a [[Royal Navy|Royal Naval]] air base at [[Appleton Thorn]] ([[RNAS Stretton]]) and an army base at the [[Peninsula Barracks, Warrington|Peninsula Barracks]] in O'Leary Street.<ref>{{cite web|title=Townships: Warrington, A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 3 |year=1907|pages= 316–324|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41338 |access-date= 10 August 2014}}</ref> The [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] was based at the [[Bath Street drill hall]] until they moved to Peninsula Barracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vinf-no/la-KING58.htm|title=5th/8th Battalion, The King's Regiment|publisher=Regiments.org|access-date=8 September 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816074532/http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vinf-no/la-KING58.htm|archive-date=16 August 2007}}</ref>

In October 1987, [[Sweden|Swedish]] home products retailer [[IKEA]] opened its first British store in the Burtonwood area of the town, bringing more than 200 retail jobs to the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_IE/about_ikea/press/PR_FILES/IKEA_21Years_PP.pdf|title=Home is the most important place in the world.|work=IKEA|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928132114/http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_IE/about_ikea/press/PR_FILES/IKEA_21Years_PP.pdf|archive-date=28 September 2011}}</ref>

==Governance==
{{main|Borough of Warrington|Warrington Borough Council}}
The [[borough of Warrington]] is a [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority]], with [[Warrington Borough Council]] providing both [[non-metropolitan district|district-level]] and [[non-metropolitan county|county-level]] functions. The central part of the modern borough, corresponding to the pre-1974 borough boundaries, is an [[unparished area]]; the rest of the borough is covered by [[civil parish]]es, which form a second tier of local government for their areas.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lancashire: Diagram showing administrative boundaries, 1969 |url=https://maps.nls.uk/view/241243156 |website=National Library of Scotland |publisher=Ordnance Survey |access-date=12 January 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Election Maps |url=https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/election-maps/gb/ |publisher=Ordnance Survey |access-date=12 January 2024}}</ref>

===History===
Warrington was an [[ancient parish]] comprising five [[Township (England)|townships]], being [[Burtonwood]], [[Poulton-with-Fearnhead]], [[Rixton-with-Glazebrook]], [[Woolston, Cheshire|Woolston-with-Martinscroft]] and a Warrington township covering the town itself and adjoining areas. The parish was part of the [[West Derby Hundred]] of Lancashire, and the River Mersey formed the county boundary.<ref>{{cite web |title=Warrington Ancient Parish / Civil Parish |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10384321 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=11 January 2024}}</ref> The land on the south bank of the river was in the township of [[Latchford, Cheshire|Latchford]], in the parish of [[Grappenhall]] in Cheshire.<ref>{{cite web |title=Grappenhall Ancient Parish / Civil Parish |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10007320 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=12 January 2024}}</ref>

In 1813 [[improvement commissioners]] were appointed for the township of Warrington, being the town's first form of urban local government; prior to that the town was governed by its [[vestry]] and [[manorial court]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Warrington Improvement and Bridewell Act 1813 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Geo3/53/118/contents/enacted |website=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=The National Archives |access-date=11 January 2024}}</ref> The town was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]] by a [[royal charter]] dated 3 April 1847. The borough boundaries differed from the township in some areas: more rural parts of the Warrington township were excluded from the borough, whereas the built-up parts of Latchford on the south bank of the Mersey in Cheshire were included within the borough.<ref>{{cite web |title=Warrington Improvement and Market Act 1854 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Vict/17-18/8/contents/enacted |website=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=The National Archives |access-date=11 January 2024}}</ref>

From 1847 until 1889 the borough straddled Lancashire and Cheshire. In 1889 boroughs which straddled county boundaries were placed entirely in the county which had the majority of the population, and so the part of the borough south of the Mersey was transferred from Cheshire to Lancashire.<ref>[[Local Government Act 1888]]</ref> The borough boundaries were subsequently enlarged on several occasions, notably in 1890, 1933 and 1954.<ref>{{cite web |title=Warrington Extension and Water Act 1890 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Vict/53-54/236/contents/enacted |website=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=The National Archives |access-date=11 January 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Warrington Extension Act 1932 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Geo5/22-23/88/contents/enacted |website=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=The National Archives |access-date=11 January 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Warrington Municipal Borough / County Borough |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10109450#tab02 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=11 January 2024}}</ref>

The town had its own police force from 1847 to 1969.<ref>page 160 'The history of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary 1856–2006' (2006) {{ISBN|18472600505|invalid1=yes}}, {{OCLC|234295855}} Just before the First World War Warrington County Borough Police had 82 police officers (The Police Encyclopedia Vol 2 by Hargrave L Adam (London: Waverley Book Company) (no date but published circa 1910)).</ref>

Warrington acquired [[county borough]] status upon reaching a population of 50,000 in 1900 and until 1974 was known as the [[County Borough of Warrington]].  As part of proposed local government reforms of England, in 1969 the [[Redcliffe-Maud Report]] suggested merging Warrington with either [[Merseyside]] or [[Greater Manchester]] [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]]. Lobbying by the borough council averted this. But, since these county boundary changes were to make Warrington non-contiguous with Lancashire, under the [[Local Government Act 1972|local government reforms]] of 1974, Warrington, incorporating [[Lymm]] [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|Urban District]] and part of [[Runcorn Rural District]] from Cheshire, and part of [[Warrington Rural District]], was made a borough within [[Cheshire County Council]].

On 1 April 1998, Warrington became an independent [[unitary authority]], though it is still served by [[Cheshire Police]] and [[Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service]], and forms part of Cheshire for [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial]] purposes, such as the [[Lord Lieutenant|Lord Lieutenancy]]. Warrington has applied unsuccessfully for [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]], the most recent attempt being after the opening of the Peace Centre as a "City for Peace".

===National representation===
At [[British House of Commons|Westminster]], Warrington is represented by two [[Member of Parliament|MPs]]: [[Charlotte Nichols]] represents [[Warrington North (UK Parliament constituency)|Warrington North]], and [[Sarah Hall (British politician)|Sarah Hall]] represents [[Warrington South (UK Parliament constituency)|Warrington South]]. Both are [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MPs.

===Warrington Borough Council===
The current borders of Warrington Borough cover the former [[County Borough]] of Warrington, Lymm Urban District, [[Warrington Rural District]] and part of [[Golborne]] Urban District, part of [[Runcorn Rural District]] and part of [[Whiston Rural District]].

===Green belt===
{{further|North West Green Belt}}
Warrington is within a [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] region that extends into the wider surrounding counties, and is in place to reduce [[urban sprawl]], prevent the towns in the nearby [[Greater Manchester Built-up Area|Manchester]] and [[Liverpool Urban Area|Merseyside]] conurbations from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage [[brownfield]] reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas, and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.<ref name="belt">{{cite web|title=Warrington Borough Council – Green Belt Assessment Final Report|url=https://www.warrington.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/11804/green_belt_assessment_final_report_oct_2016pdf.pdf|website=Warrington.gov.uk|access-date=22 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180216025109/https://www.warrington.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/11804/green_belt_assessment_final_report_oct_2016pdf.pdf|archive-date=16 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The main urban area and larger villages of the borough are exempt from the green belt area, but surrounding smaller villages, hamlets and rural areas such as Rixton, Glazebrook, Higher Walton, Kenyon, Stretton, Hatton, [[Broomedge]] are 'washed over' with the designation. The green belt was first drawn up in 1977 under [[Cheshire County Council]],<ref name="belt"/> and the size in the borough in 2017 amounted to {{convert|11500|ha|km2+sqmi}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Green belt statistics – GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/green-belt-statistics|website=Gov.uk|date=12 October 2023 |language=en}}</ref>

A subsidiary aim of the green belt is to encourage recreation and leisure interests,<ref name="belt"/> with rural landscape features and facilities including Walton Hall gardens with zoo and bicycle museum, St Oswald's Church and well, the River Mersey with valley and trail, [[River Bollin]], [[Manchester Ship Canal]], [[Bridgewater Canal]], Appleton Reservoir, numerous playing fields, parks and golf clubs, Cuerdley and Norton marshes, the [[Trans Pennine Trail]], the [[Mersey]] Forest project, and Sow Brook.

[[File:The Skittles, Warrington, March 2011jpg.jpg|thumb|270x270px|The Skittles]]
In spite of its proximity to significant retail areas in [[Manchester]], Liverpool, [[Chester]] and the out-of-town [[Trafford Centre]], Warrington continues to have one of the larger shopping centres in [[North West England]]. Despite the competition, Warrington has seen an increase in its customer trade, due in part to the modernisation of the town centre. It has a shopping centre (Golden Square) first opened in 1974,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.warrington.gov.uk/info/201142/local-history-and-heritage/54/history-of-warrington-market|title=History of Warrington Market|last=Evans|first=Sian|website=Warrington.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2 July 2018|archive-date=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702233317/https://www.warrington.gov.uk/info/201142/local-history-and-heritage/54/history-of-warrington-market|url-status=dead}}</ref> which has been extended to include a [[Primark]] store, and a new bus station.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.gswarrington.com/centre-map/|title=Centre Map – Golden Square Warrington|website=Gswarrington.com|access-date=2 July 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>

The old Cockhedge Textile Mill was demolished and replaced by another shopping mall. The main shopping streets are Buttermarket Street, Horsemarket Street, Sankey Street and [[Bridge Street, Warrington|Bridge Street]]. Where these four streets intersect at Market Gate, there is a redevelopment with a large fountain and "guardians" (known locally as "the skittles") designed by [[Howard Ben Tré]]. Musical instrument retailer [[Dawsons Music]] originates in the town, and was located on Sankey Street from 1898 until 2019.<ref name="ww-dawsons">{{cite web |title=Dawsons to close Warrington HQ after 121 year presence in the town |url=https://www.warrington-worldwide.co.uk/2019/03/08/dawsons-to-close-warrington-hq-after-121-year-presence-in-the-town/ |website=Warrington Worldwide |access-date=24 November 2020 |date=8 March 2019}}</ref> The town also has a large indoor market which was redeveloped as part of the Time Square development which brought the return of a cinema in the town centre along with office space, restaurants, bars and retail opportunities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesquarewarrington.co.uk/the-scheme/|title = The Scheme – Time Square|website=Timessquarewarrington.co.uk| date=12 April 2016 }}</ref>

===Leisure===
There is [[ten-pin bowling]] located in the town centre and at Winwick Quay, and indoor paintball. An indoor karting centre is located near to Bank Quay. Pitch and putt and crazy golf are available at Walton Hall and Gardens. A Laser Quest arena and a snooker club can also be found in Warrington, both located close to the town centre. [[Gulliver's World]] theme park is located in Old Hall, Apple Jack's Farm theme park is situated in [[Stretton, Warrington|Stretton]].

===Developments===
The [[Omega Development Site]] close to the [[M62 motorway|M62]] on the northern edge of Warrington, on part of the site of the [[RAF Burtonwood|Burtonwood Airbase]], was intended to be a major business park but has instead been developed as mainly warehousing with a large residential area.

Other planned developments in Warrington were delayed by the economic climate, but redevelopment of the Time Square area, including a new Market, multi-story car park with around 1,200 spaces, cinema, retail outlets and council offices was completed in 2020 with an estimated cost of £142 million.

Warrington is developing a new [[Local Plan]] but plans to build 24,000 new homes were scaled back as government guidance changed. Included in the plans would be a new "Garden City Suburb" in the south of Warrington. The four main areas of growth as outlined in the planning were the waterfront around the [[River Mersey]], the town centre, the Garden City Suburb and south west urban extension.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.warrington.gov.uk/info/201368/local_plan_review/2347/local_plan_review_-_supporting_documents |title=Local plan review - supporting documents &#124; Local plan review - supporting documents &#124; Warrington Borough Council |access-date=22 July 2017 |archive-date=4 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190304231224/https://www.warrington.gov.uk/info/201368/local_plan_review/2347/local_plan_review_-_supporting_documents |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Transport==
[[File:Warrington - 1851 - Project Gutenberg eText 13721.jpg|thumb|Warrington after the coming of the railway, 1851]]

{{Main|Transport in Warrington}}

The town has two main railway stations: [[Warrington Bank Quay railway station|Bank Quay]] is on the [[West Coast Main Line]] between [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] and [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central]] and the [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester Piccadilly]] to [[North Wales]] via [[Chester railway station|Chester]] line, while [[Warrington Central railway station|Central]] is on the Liverpool to Manchester line (via [[Widnes]] and Warrington) with through services to [[Sheffield]] then to [[East Anglia]] or [[Cleethorpes]]. Bank Quay is much altered, but Central (built 1873) is of some architectural merit, featuring polychromatic brickwork. Both have undergone some refurbishment including new entrances. There are also railway stations in the suburbs at [[Padgate railway station|Padgate]], [[Sankey railway station|Sankey]], [[Glazebrook railway station|Glazebrook]] and [[Birchwood railway station|Birchwood]]. A new railway station, [[Warrington West railway station|Warrington West]] in Chapelford, near [[Great Sankey]], opened in December 2019.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-50808946 |title=Warrington West: Town's new £20.5m railway station opens |publisher=BBC |date=16 December 2019 |access-date=17 December 2019 }}</ref>

The town lies close to the [[M62 motorway|M62]], [[M6 motorway|M6]] and [[M56 motorway]]s and midway between [[Liverpool John Lennon Airport|Liverpool]] and [[Manchester Airport|Manchester]] airports. It also has five primary A roads, the [[A49 road|A49]], [[A50 road|A50]], [[A56 road|A56]], [[A57 road|A57]] and [[A580 road|A580 (East Lancashire Road)]], which forms part of the northern boundary of the borough.

[[Warrington's Own Buses]], one of the few [[municipal bus companies]] to survive in public ownership, runs most bus services within the town. The [[Bee Network]] and [[Arriva North West]] provide bus links to surrounding destinations such as Manchester, the Trafford Centre, Liverpool, St Helens, Runcorn, Widnes and Chester. A real-time [[passenger information system]] is installed at some bus stops. A new bus station known as Warrington Interchange opened in 2006 at the Golden Square Shopping Centre.

The River Mersey runs through the heart of the town dividing it in two. There are only two main thoroughfares crossing the Mersey in Warrington: at [[Warrington Bridge]] at Bridge Foot and at the Kingsway Bridge. Before the M6 was built, these routes were very busy with through traffic.

The [[Manchester Ship Canal]] runs through the south of the town; three swing bridges and a high-level cantilever bridge provide crossing points. Although shipping movements on the ship canal are far less frequent than in years past, they can cause severe delay to local road traffic. The [[Bridgewater Canal]] runs through the borough from the village of Lymm to Walton Hall and Gardens, a local park/leisure area. The course of the [[Sankey Canal]] runs through the west of the town, although the only navigable section is at the lock to the [[River Mersey]] estuary at Fiddlers Ferry.

===Warrington Bus Interchange===
[[File:Warrington Bus Interchange exterior.jpg|thumb|Warrington Bus Interchange in October 2009]]

The interchange consists of 19 departure stands, numbered from 1 to 19, all of which employ a drive-in reverse-out layout. Each stand has a computerised information screen which also ties into the [[Passenger information system|real-time information system]]. All stands are served from the main concourse building, which contains toilets, a newsagent, cafe, and a combined travel and tourist information office. There is access to the Golden Square shopping centre via escalators and lifts. The exits on the eastern side of the building lead onto Winwick Street, on which can be found a [[taxi rank]] and [[Warrington Central railway station]] within around 100 metres.

The bus station is the terminus for all local bus services within Warrington. Regional services operate to neighbouring cities [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]] and [[Chester]], as well as to [[Wigan]], [[Leigh, Greater Manchester|Leigh]], the [[Trafford Centre]], [[Altrincham]], [[Northwich]], [[Runcorn]], [[Widnes]] and [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]]. The majority of bus services are operated by [[Warrington's Own Buses]]. Other services are provided by [[Arriva North West]] and [[Bee Network]].

==== History ====
Warrington Bus Interchange (also known as Warrington Interchange) opened on 21 August 2006,<ref>{{cite news|date=16 August 2007|title=New bus station is built to last|work=Warrington Guardian|url=http://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/news/1620330.New_bus_station_is_built_to_last/|access-date=17 February 2009}}</ref> next to the site of a temporary terminus that had been in use for the past thirteen months. The new interchange was built in conjunction with the extension and upgrade of the adjoining [[Golden Square shopping centre]], and replaced the previous bus station which dated from 1979.<ref>{{cite news|date=1 August 2005|title=New bus station makes history|work=Warrington Guardian|url=http://archive.thisischeshire.co.uk/2005/8/1/256019.html|url-status=dead|access-date=17 February 2009|archive-url=https://archive.today/20070713150527/http://archive.thisischeshire.co.uk/2005/8/1/256019.html|archive-date=13 July 2007}}</ref>

In 2021, a 3.5 metre artwork was painted on glass at the bus station.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Morgan|first=David|date=2021-07-14|title=This is why 48 portraits have been painted onto a window at Warrington bus station|url=https://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/news/19442560.48-portraits-painted-warrington-bus-station/|access-date=2021-07-29|website=Warrington Guardian|language=en}}</ref>

===Events===
A number of festivals, carnivals and [[walking day]]s are held annually in the Warrington area. Warrington Walking Day – originally a Sunday school festival – is held on the closest Friday to the last day of June, and the town centre is closed to traffic as churches walk together through the streets.<ref>{{cite book|last=Forrest|first=David|title=Warrington Walking Day: A Brief History}}</ref>
