Co-ruled by the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]] and the [[Pakualaman|Duchy of Pakualaman]], the region is the only officially recognized [[diarchy]] within the [[government of Indonesia]]. The [[Yogyakarta|city of Yogyakarta]] is a popular tourist destination and cultural center of the region. The Yogyakarta Sultanate was established in 1755 and provided unwavering support for Indonesia's independence during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] (1945–1949). As a first-level division in Indonesia, Yogyakarta is governed by Sultan [[Hamengkubuwono X]] as the governor and Duke [[Paku Alam X]] as the vice governor. With a land area of just 3,170.65 km<sup>2</sup>, it is the second-smallest province-level entity of Indonesia after [[Jakarta]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jogjaprov.go.id/berita/detail/luas-wilayah|title=Luas wilayah|date=1 June 2010|website=jogjaprov.go.id}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Further|Yogyakarta Sultanate|List of governors of Yogyakarta}}
[[File:Yogyakarta Sultanate Hamengkubhuwono X Emblem.svg|left|thumb|''Praja Cihna'' ([[Javanese language|Javanese]]: ꦥꦿꦗꦕꦶꦃꦤ), coat of arms or crest of the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]] that is upheld by [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]] society. The crest contains the [[Javanese script]] ꦲꦨ꧀ꦮ, a [[royal monogram]] of [[Hamengkubuwono]].]]
In Javanese, it is pronounced {{IPA-jv|joɡjaˈkartɔ|}}, and named after the city of [[Ayodhya (Ramayana)|Ayodhya]] in Javanese-Hindu mythology.<ref>"[https://books.google.com/books?id=ncqJAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT59 Raffles and the British Invasion of Java]," Tim Hannigan, Monsoon Books, 2012, {{ISBN|9789814358866}}, ''.. Its full formal name was Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat. Like the Thai town of Ayutthaya, Yogyakarta was named for Ayodhya, the mythical birthplace of the Hindu god Rama ..''</ref> The [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name of the Special Region is '''Djokjakarta'''.

The Sultanate has existed in various forms and survived through the rule of the Dutch and the 1942 invasion of the [[Dutch East Indies]] by the [[Japanese Empire]]. In August 1945 Indonesia's first president, [[Sukarno]] proclaimed the independence of the [[Indonesian Republic]], and by September of that year, Sultan [[Hamengkubuwono IX]] and Duke [[Sri Paku Alam VIII]] had sent letters to Sukarno expressing their support for the newly born nation of Indonesia, in which they acknowledged the Yogyakarta Sultanate as part of the Indonesian Republic. The [[Sunanate of Surakarta]] did the same, and both of the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] kingdoms were awarded special status as special regions within the Indonesian Republic. However, due to a leftist anti-royalist uprising in [[Surakarta]], the [[Sunanate of Surakarta]] lost its special administrative status in 1946 and was absorbed into the province of [[Central Java]].

Yogyakarta's overwhelming support and the Sultan's patriotism were essential in the Indonesian struggle for independence during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] (1945–1949). The city of Yogyakarta became the capital of the [[Indonesian Republic]] from January 1946 to December 1948 after the fall of [[Jakarta]] to the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]. Later, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] also invaded Yogyakarta causing the Indonesian Republic's capital to be transferred again to [[Bukittinggi]] in [[West Sumatra]] on 19 December 1948. In return for Yogyakarta's support, the declaration of Special Authority over Yogyakarta was granted in full in 1950 and Yogyakarta was given the status of a Special Administrative Region, making Yogyakarta the only region headed by a monarchy in [[Indonesia]]. 

The Special Region was struck by [[2006 Yogyakarta earthquake|a 6.3-magnitude earthquake]] on 27 May 2006, killing 5,782 people, injuring approximately 36,000, and leaving 600,000 people homeless.<ref>{{cite news | date = 2006-06-06 | title = Indonesia lowers quake death toll | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/06/05/indonesia.quake/ | publisher = CNN | access-date = 2006-06-06 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060615194254/http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/06/05/indonesia.quake/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2006-06-15}}</ref> The region of [[Bantul]] suffered the most damage and deaths.

== Geography ==
[[File:Merapi National Park.jpg|thumb|left|View of Mount Merapi]]
The Special Region is located near the southern coast of Java, surrounded on three sides by the province of [[Central Java]], and with the [[Indian Ocean]] on the south side. The population at the 2010 Census was 3,457,491 people,<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> which then increased to 3,668,719 at the 2020 Census;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate for mid-2023 was 3,736,489 (comprising 1,849,540 males and 1,886,950 females).<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Provinsi Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.34)</ref> It has an area of 3,170.65&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, making it the second-smallest area of the provinces in Indonesia, after the [[Jakarta]] Capital Region. Along with surrounding areas in Central Java, it has some of the highest population densities of Java.

[[Mount Merapi]] is located to the immediate north of the city of Yogyakarta and [[Sleman Regency]].  It is the most active volcano in Indonesia and has erupted regularly since 1548.  It last erupted in October–November 2010, killing and injuring many people and temporarily displacing approximately 100,000 residents.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/update-indonesia-volcano-death-toll-soars-past-100-many-children-dead/405050| title = Update: Indonesia Volcano Death Toll Soars Past 100; 'Many Children Dead, by Gandang Sajarw| publisher = Jakarta Globe| date = 2010-11-05| access-date = 2010-11-05| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120917032903/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/update-indonesia-volcano-death-toll-soars-past-100-many-children-dead/405050| archive-date = 2012-09-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/10/photogalleries/101026-indonesia-mount-merapi-volcano-eruption-world-science-pictures-photos/#/mount-merapi-volcano-eruption-indonesia-hospital_27886_600x450.jpg |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029024701/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/10/photogalleries/101026-indonesia-mount-merapi-volcano-eruption-world-science-pictures-photos#/mount-merapi-volcano-eruption-indonesia-hospital_27886_600x450.jpg |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 October 2010 |title=Pictures: Indonesia's Mount Merapi Volcano Erupts |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=2010-10-26 |access-date=2011-02-07}}</ref>

=== Geo-heritage sites ===
[[File:Kraton Ratu Boko (Ratu Boko Temple) in Yogyakarta, Indonesia 03.jpg|thumb|[[Ratu Boko]]]]
[[File:Prambanan Temple Yogyakarta Indonesia.jpg|thumb|[[Prambanan]] temple]]
Indonesia has several geo-heritage sites in the Yogyakarta Special Region. It has been declared by the Geological Agency of the [[Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources]]. The sites consist of nine sites: Eocene limestone in Gamping (Sleman Regency), pillow lava in Berbah (Sleman), pre-historic volcanic sediment in Candi Ijo, Prambanan (Sleman), dunes in Parangtritis Beach (Bantul Regency), Kiskendo cave, and former manganese mining site in Kleripan (Kulonprogo regency), the prehistoric volcano in Nglanggeran (Gunungkidul regency), Wediombo-Siung beaches (Gunungkidul) and Bioturbasi site in Kalingalang (Gunungkidul). The most unusual one is pillow lava in Berbah (Sleman) which is a big, rough black rock that lies on the bank of the narrow Dengkeng River. The prehistoric volcano in Nglanggeran (Gunungkidul Regency) has already been developed as a tourist destination.

=== Governor and legislature ===
{{Further|List of governors of Yogyakarta}}

According to Act No. 22 of 1948 (which is also the basis of Act No. 3 of 1950 on the formation of DIY), the Head and Vice Head of the Special Region are appointed by the [[President of Indonesia|president]] from the descendants of the ruling family in the region before Indonesian independence with the conditions of "skill, honesty, and loyalty, and keeping in mind the customs of the area." Thus, the Head of the Special Region, until 1988, was automatically held by the reigning Sultan of Yogyakarta, and the Vice Head of the Special Region, until 1998, was automatically held by Prince Paku Alam who was on the throne. The nomenclature of the Governor and Vice Governor of the Special Region has only been used since 1999 with the issuance of Act No. 22 of 1999. Since 2012, the mechanism for filling the positions of Governor and Vice Governor of DIY is regulated by Act No. 13 of 2012 on the Uniqueness of the Special Region of Yogyakarta.<ref>{{cite act |type=Act |index=13 |date=2012  |legislature=[[People's Representative Council]] |title=Undang-undang Nomor 13 Tahun 2012 tentang Keistimewaan Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta |url=https://peraturan.bpk.go.id/Home/Details/39064 |language=id}}</ref>

The province has a regional legislature, the [[Special Region of Yogyakarta Regional House of Representatives]], which as of the [[2024 Indonesian general election|2024 election]] has 55 members. The largest party in the legislature is the [[Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://yogyakarta.pikiran-rakyat.com/news/pr-2787811511/terpilih-55-caleg-untuk-dprd-diy-hasil-pemilu-2024-pdip-tambah-2-kursi-pan-berkurang-2-kursi-psi-bertahan?page=all|work=[[Pikiran Rakyat]]|title=Terpilih 55 Caleg untuk DPRD DIY hasil Pemilu 2024|date=8 March 2024|access-date=24 March 2024}}</ref>
=== Administrative divisions ===
The Special Region of Yogyakarta (provincial level) is subdivided into four [[Regencies of Indonesia|regencies]] ({{lang|id|kabupaten}}) and one [[Cities of Indonesia|city]] ({{lang|id|kota}}), and divided further into districts ({{lang|id|kapanewon}} or {{lang|id|kemantren}} in the city of Yogyakarta) and villages (rural {{lang|id|kalurahan}} or urban {{lang|id|kelurahan}}, [[doublet (linguistics)|doublet]]); these are listed below, with their areas and their population at the 2000, 2010<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 2020<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> Censuses, with their present estimates, as of mid-2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Provinsi Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.34)</ref>

|}[[File:Special Region of Yogyakarta.png|thumb|Administrative Map of Yogyakarta Special Region]]Located within the Special Region of Yogyakarta, the [[Yogyakarta|city of Yogyakarta]] is known as a center of classical Javanese fine art and culture, such as ''[[batik]]'', ballet, drama, music, poetry, and [[Shadow play|shadow puppetry]]. It is also one of Indonesia's most renowned centres of higher education. At the city's core is the Sultan's [[Kraton (Indonesia)|palace]], the ''[[Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat|Kraton]]''. While the city sprawls outward in all directions from the Kraton, the "modern" centre of the city is located to the north.

The Special Region forms one of Indonesia's 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the [[Indonesian Parliament|People's Representative Council]]. The '''Yogyakarta S.R.

Yogyakarta is served by [[Adisutjipto International Airport]] and [[Yogyakarta International Airport]], the latter being opened for minimum operations in late April 2019 and fully operational starting late March 2020. There are two main railway stations: [[Lempuyangan Station]] and [[Yogyakarta railway station]].

Yogyakarta is considered one of the major hubs that link the west–east main railway route in Java island. Yogyakarta Station is the main train station located in the center, and Lempuyangan Station is the second train station in the city. The two stations have their schedule to and from other cities on Java island. The [[Prambanan Express]] commuter rail service operates west of Yogyakarta Station across Kulonprogo Regency to Purworejo, and [[KAI Commuter Yogyakarta Line]] electric commuter rail system operates from east of the station to Surakarta. To the south, in the Bantul region, is the Giwangan bus station, one of the largest bus stations in Indonesia. The Yogyakarta metropolitan centre is surrounded by a ring road.

In 2008, the government of the Special Region of Yogyakarta launched a [[bus rapid transit]] system, the [[Trans Jogja]], which connects places in and around Yogyakarta City, including the airport and the [[Prambanan]] temple. Today,{{when|date=December 2020}} Trans Jogja has reached other points in the south side of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indonesialogue.com/planning-a-trip/trans-jogja-busway-yogyakarta-central-java.html |title=Trans Jogja Busway: Yogyakarta, Central Java |publisher=Indonesialogue.com |date=2008-02-26 |access-date=2011-02-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310192209/http://www.indonesialogue.com/planning-a-trip/trans-jogja-busway-yogyakarta-central-java.html |archive-date=2012-03-10 }}</ref>
