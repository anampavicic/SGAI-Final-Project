Located in the country's [[Southern District (Israel)|Southern District]], it lies on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] [[Israeli coastal plain|coast]] {{convert|32|km|mi|abbr=off}} south of Tel Aviv and {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Ashkelon]]. [[Port of Ashdod|Ashdod's port]] is the largest in Israel, handling 60% of the country's imported goods.

Ashdod has a history spanning approximately 3,700 years.<ref>{{cite book |author=B.Frenkel |title=The Philistines |publisher=Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, Ashdod branch |year=1990 |location=Israel |page=119 |language=he |id=ULI Sysno. 005093624}}</ref> In [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|biblical times]], it was one of the five principal cities of the [[Philistines]]. The city's name was later preserved in the Arab town of [[Isdud]], which was depopulated during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. In ancient times, Ashdod developed as an active maritime trade center, with its ports identified at [[Ashdod-Yam]] and Tel Mor. The remains of the ancient city and later settlements are located at [[Ashdod (ancient city)|Tel Ashdod]].

Modern Ashdod was established in 1956 on the sand hills, 6 kilometers northwest of the ancient site.<ref>{{cite book |author=Karṭa (Firm) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jxtGwWDXo-AC |title=Carta's Official Guide to Israel: And Complete Gazetteer to All Sites in the Holy Land |publisher=State of Israel, Ministry of Defence Publishing House |year=1983 |isbn=978-965-220-047-1 |page=81 |quote=Tel Ashdod...

Alongside the port, the city hosts additional national infrastructure, making it an important industrial center. Dr. [[Yehiel Lasri]] has been the mayor of Ashdod since 2008. The city is a member of the Forum of 15 cities.

Since its establishment, Ashdod has absorbed extensive Jewish immigration from around the world, resulting in one of the highest percentages of new immigrants in Israel.

Three stone tools dating from the [[Neolithic era]] were discovered, but no other evidence of a [[Stone Age]] settlement in Ashdod was found, suggesting that the tools were deposited there in a later period.<ref name="Ashdod VI">Moshe Dothan, Ashdod VI: The Excavations of Areas H and K (1968–1969) (Iaa Reports) (v. 6), Israel Antiquities Authority, 2005, {{ISBN|978-965-406-178-0}}</ref>

The historical town of Ashdod (today referred to as Tel Ashdod / [[Isdud]]), was c. 6 km southeast of the center of the modern town. It dates to the 17th century BCE, and was a prominent [[Philistines|Philistine]] city, one of the [[Philistia|five Philistine city-states]]. The coastal site of [[Ashdod-Yam]], today southwest of the modern city, was a separate city for most of its history.

The first documented urban settlement at Tel Ashdod / Isdud dates to the 17th century BCE, when it was a fortified [[Canaan|Canaanite]] city.<ref name="Excavation">{{cite book |author=Moshe Dothan |title=Ashdod – Seven levels of excavations |publisher=Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, Ashdod branch |year=1990 |location=Israel |page=91 |language=he |id=ULI Sysno. 005093624}}</ref> It was destroyed at the [[Bronze Age Collapse|end of the Late Bronze Age]].

During the [[Iron Age]], it was a prominent [[Philistines|Philistine]] city, one of the [[Philistia|five Philistine city-states]]. It is mentioned 13 times in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. After being captured by [[Uzziah]], it was briefly ruled by the [[Kingdom of Judah]] before it was taken by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]]. During the [[Yehud (Persian province)|Persian period]], [[Nehemiah]] condemned the returning Jews for intermarrying Ashdod's residents. Under [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic rule]], the city was known as ''Azotus''. It was later incorporated into the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean kingdom]]. During&nbsp;the 1st century BCE, [[Pompey]] removed the city from Judean rule and annexed it to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Roman Syria|province of Syria]]. Ashdod was a [[Diocese|bishopric]] under [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine rule]], but its importance gradually slipped and by the [[Middle Ages]] it was a village.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ashdod {{!}} Israel {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Ashdod |access-date=2022-06-25 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref>
