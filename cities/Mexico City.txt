== Nicknames and mottos ==
Mexico City was traditionally known as ''La Ciudad de los Palacios'' ("the City of the Palaces"), a [[nickname]] attributed to Baron [[Alexander von Humboldt]] when visiting the city in the 19th century, who, sending a letter back to Germany, said Mexico City could rival any major city in Europe. But it was English politician [[Charles La Trobe|Charles Latrobe]] who really penned the following: "... look at their works: the moles, aqueducts, churches, roads—and the luxurious ''City of Palaces'' which has risen from the clay-built ruins of Tenochtitlan...", on page 84 of the Letter V of ''The Rambler in Mexico''.<ref>''Diccionario Porrúa. Historia, Biografía y Geografía de México'', Editorial Porrúa, S.A., Mexico City, Fifth Edition, 1986, Vol. II, page 1638.</ref>

During the colonial period, the city's [[motto]] was "Muy Noble e Insigne, Muy Leal e Imperial" (Very Noble and Distinguished, Very Loyal and Imperial).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esteticas.unam.mx/revista_imagenes/anotaciones/ano_dallal01.html|title=La Ciudad de México: el espectáculo más grande del mundo|author=Alberto Dallal|website=Electronic magazine Imágenes of the [[Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas|Institute of Aesthetic Research]] of the National Autonomous University of Mexico|access-date=19 November 2019|archive-date=9 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191109073642/http://www.esteticas.unam.mx/revista_imagenes/anotaciones/ano_dallal01.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=La muy noble, muy leal, insigne é imperial ciudad de México, cabeza de los reynos y provincias de Nueva España y en si nombre los señores presidente y vocales que componen la Real Junta de Policía de esta Córte con anuencia del Exmo.

This motto was quickly adopted as a city nickname but has faded since the new motto, ''Capital en Movimiento'' ("Capital in Movement"), was adopted by the administration headed by [[Marcelo Ebrard]], though the latter is not treated as often as a nickname in media. 
Up until 2013, it was common to refer to the city by the initialism 
"DF" from "Distrito Federal de México". Since 2013, the abbreviation "CDMX" (Ciudad de México) has been more common, particularly in relation to government campaigns.

The city is colloquially known as ''Chilangolandia'' after the locals' nickname ''[[chilango]]s''.<ref>1994 Oxford Spanish-English Dictionary</ref> Chilango is used pejoratively by people living outside Mexico City to "connote a loud, arrogant, ill-mannered, loutish person".{{sfn|Lida|2008|page=15}} For their part those living in Mexico City designate insultingly those who live elsewhere as living in ''la provincia'' ('the provinces', 'the periphery') and many proudly embrace the term chilango.{{sfn|Lida|2008|page=15}} Residents of Mexico City are more recently called ''defeños'' (deriving from the postal abbreviation of the Federal District in Spanish: D.F., which is read "De-Efe"). They are formally called ''capitalinos'' (in reference to the city being the capital of the country), but "[p]erhaps because capitalino is the more polite, specific, and correct word, it is almost never utilized".{{sfn|Lida|2008|page=16}}

The area was the destination of the migrations of the [[Chichimeca|Teochichimecas]] during the 8th and 13th centuries, people that would give rise to the [[Toltec]], and [[Aztecs|Mexica]] (Aztecs) cultures. The latter arrived around the 14th century to settle first on the shores of the lake.

Between 1325 and 1521, Tenochtitlan grew in size and strength, eventually dominating the other city-states around [[Lake Texcoco]] and in the Valley of Mexico. When the Spaniards arrived, the [[Aztec]] Empire had reached much of [[Mesoamerica]], touching both the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean.<ref name="Frances F. Berdan 1982, p. 14" />

=== Growth of colonial Mexico City ===
[[File:Ignacio Serrano - Catedral de México.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral]]'s (1571–1813) 18th century painting. The cathedral was built by the Spaniards over the ruins of the main Aztec temple.]]

The city had been the capital of the [[Aztec Empire]] and in the colonial era, Mexico City became the capital of [[New Spain]]. The [[viceroy of Mexico]] or vice-king lived in the viceregal palace on the main square or [[Zócalo]]. The [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral]], the seat of the Archbishopric of New Spain, was constructed on another side of the Zócalo, as was the archbishop's palace, and across from it the building housing the city council or ''ayuntamiento'' of the city. A late seventeenth-century painting of the Zócalo by [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]] depicts the main square, which had been the old Aztec ceremonial center. The existing central plaza of the Aztecs was effectively and permanently transformed to the ceremonial center and seat of power during the colonial period, and remains to this day in modern Mexico, the central plaza of the nation. The rebuilding of the city after the siege of Tenochtitlan was accomplished by the abundant indigenous labor in the surrounding area. Franciscan friar [[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia]], one of the [[Twelve Apostles of Mexico]] who arrived in New Spain in 1524, described the rebuilding of the city as one of the afflictions or plagues of the early period:

<blockquote>The seventh plague was the construction of the great City of Mexico, which, during the early years used more people than in the construction of Jerusalem. The crowds of laborers were so numerous that one could hardly move in the streets and causeways, although they are very wide. Many died from being crushed by beams, or falling from high places, or in tearing down old buildings for new ones.<ref>Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, ''Motolinia's History of the Indians of New Spain'', translated and edited by Elizabeth Adnros Foster. Wesport: Greenwood Press, (1950) 1973, pp. 41–42</ref></blockquote> 
[[File:Atlas Van der Hagen-KW1049B13 078-Panorama van- NOVA MEXICO.jpeg|thumb|Mexico City in 1690. Atlas Van der Hagen.]]

Preconquest Tenochtitlan was built in the center of the inland lake system, with the city reachable by [[canoe]] and by wide causeways to the mainland. The causeways were rebuilt under Spanish rule with indigenous labor. Colonial Spanish cities were constructed on a grid pattern, if no geographical obstacle prevented it. In Mexico City, the Zócalo (main square) was the central place from which the grid was then built outward. The Spanish lived in the area closest to the main square in what was known as the ''traza'', in orderly, well laid-out streets. Indigenous residences were outside that exclusive zone and houses were haphazardly located.<ref>Edmundo O'Gorman, ''Reflexiones sobre la distribución urbana coloinal de la ciudad de México'', Mexico 1938, pp. 16ff.</ref> Spaniards sought to keep indigenous people separate but since the Zócalo was a center of commerce for Amerindians, they were a constant presence in the central area, so strict segregation was never enforced.<ref>Magnus Mörner and Charles Gibson, "Diego Muñoz Camargo and the Segregation Policy of the Spanish Crown," ''Hispanic American Historical Review'', vol. 42, pp. 558ff.</ref> At intervals Zócalo was where major celebrations took place as well as executions. It was also the site of two major riots in the seventeenth century, one in 1624, the other in 1692.<ref>Ida Altman, Sarah Cline, and Javier Pescador, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico'', Pearson 2003, pp. 246–249.</ref>

The city grew as the population did, coming up against the lake's waters. As the depth of the lake water fluctuated, Mexico City was subject to periodic flooding. A major labor draft, the [[desagüe]], compelled thousands of indigenous over the colonial period to work on infrastructure to prevent flooding. Floods were not only an inconvenience but also a health hazard, since during flood periods human waste polluted the city's streets. By draining the area, the mosquito population dropped as did the frequency of the diseases they spread. However, draining the wetlands also changed the habitat for fish and birds and the areas accessible for indigenous cultivation close to the capital.<ref>Noble David Cook, ''Born to Die: Disease and New World Conquest, 1492–1650.'' New York: Cambridge University Press 1998.</ref> The 16th century saw a proliferation of churches, many of which can still be seen today in the [[Historic center of Mexico City|historic center]].<ref name="Enc Mex 2000" />
Economically, Mexico City prospered as a result of trade. Unlike Brazil or [[Peru]], Mexico had easy contact with both the Atlantic and Pacific worlds. Although the Spanish crown tried to completely regulate all commerce in the city, it had only partial success.<ref name="Hamnett 1998">{{Cite book |title = Concise History of Mexico. |last = Hamnett |first = Brian R. |year = 1998 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |location = Port Chester, NY |isbn = 978-0-521-58120-2 |url-access = registration |url = https://archive.org/details/concisehistoryof0000hamn }}</ref>
[[Image:Palacio de mineria.jpg|thumb|left|[[Palacio de Minería]], Mexico City. The elevation of silver mining as a profession and the ennoblement of silver miners was a development of the eighteenth-century [[Bourbon Reforms]].]]

The concept of [[nobility]] flourished in New Spain in a way not seen in other parts of the Americas. Spaniards encountered a society in which the concept of nobility mirrored that of their own. Spaniards respected the indigenous order of nobility and added to it.

Most of these families proved their worth by making fortunes in New Spain outside of the city itself, then spending the revenues in the capital, building churches, supporting charities and building extravagant palatial homes. The craze to build the most opulent residence possible reached its height in the last half of the 18th century. Many of these palaces can still be seen today, leading to Mexico City's nickname of "The city of palaces" given by [[Alexander von Humboldt|Alexander Von Humboldt]].<ref name="Marroqui" /><ref name="Enc Mex 2000" /><ref name="Ladd 1998" />

=== Battle of Mexico City in the U.S.–Mexican War of 1847 ===
[[File:Nebel Mexican War 11 Chapultepec Quitman (cropped).jpg|thumb|''The American assault on the [[Chapultepec Castle]]'', 1847 by [[Carl Nebel|Nebel]] and [[Adolphe Jean-Baptiste Bayot|Bayot]]]]
During the 19th century, Mexico City was the center stage of all the political disputes of the country. It was the imperial capital on two occasions (1821–1823 and 1864–1867), and of two [[Federalism|federalist]] states and two [[Unitary state|centralist]] states that followed innumerable coups d'états in the space of half a century before the triumph of the Liberals after the [[Reform War]]. It was also the objective of one of the two French invasions to Mexico ([[Second French intervention in Mexico|1861–1867]]), and occupied for a year by American troops in the framework of the [[Mexican–American War]] (1847–1848).

The [[Battle for Mexico City]] was the series of engagements from 8 to 15 September 1847, in the general vicinity of Mexico City during the [[Mexican–American War|U.S. Mexican War]]. Included are major actions at the battles of [[Battle of Molino del Rey|Molino del Rey]] and [[Battle of Chapultepec|Chapultepec]], culminating with the fall of Mexico City. The U.S. Army under Winfield Scott scored a major success that ended the war. The American invasion into the Federal District was first resisted during the [[Battle of Churubusco]] on 8 August, where the [[Saint Patrick's Battalion]], which was composed primarily of Catholic Irish and German immigrants but also Canadians, English, French, Italians, Poles, Scots, Spaniards, Swiss, and Mexicans, fought for the Mexican cause, repelling the American attacks. After defeating the [[Saint Patrick's Battalion]], the Mexican–American War came to a close after the United States [[Deployments of the United States Military|deployed]] [[Military organization|combat units]] deep into [[Mexico]] resulting in the capture of Mexico City and [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army's]] 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th [[Division (military)|Divisions]].<ref name="Cerro">{{cite web |url = https://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/war/cerro_gordo.html |title = The Battle of Cerro Gordo |website = [[PBS]] |access-date = 18 October 2008 |archive-date = 23 October 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071023110409/https://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/war/cerro_gordo.html |url-status = live }}</ref> The invasion culminated with the storming of [[Chapultepec Castle]] in the city itself.<ref name="Storming of Chapultepec">{{cite web |url = https://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/war/chapultepec_pillows_attack.html |title = The Storming of Chapultepec (General Pillow's Attack) |website = [[PBS]] |access-date = 18 October 2008 |archive-date = 2 September 2017 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170902101312/https://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/war/chapultepec_pillows_attack.html |url-status = live }}</ref>

During this battle, on 13 September, the 4th Division, under [[John A. Quitman]], spearheaded the attack against Chapultepec and carried the castle. Future [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] generals [[George E. Pickett]] and [[James Longstreet]] participated in the attack. Serving in the Mexican defense were the cadets later immortalized as ''[[Niños Héroes|Los Niños Héroes]]'' (the "Boy Heroes"). The Mexican forces fell back from Chapultepec and retreated within the city. Attacks on the Belén and San Cosme Gates came afterwards. The [[treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] was signed in what is now the far north of the city.<ref name="treaty">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/war/wars_end_guadalupe.html |title=Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo |author=Richard Griswold del Castillo |website=[[PBS]] |access-date=18 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213210803/http://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/war/wars_end_guadalupe.html |archive-date=13 February 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Mexican Revolution (1910–1920) ===

The capital escaped the worst of the violence of the ten-year conflict of the [[Mexican Revolution]]. The most significant episode of this period for the city was the [[Decena trágica|Decena Trágica]] ("Ten Tragic Days") of February 1913, when forces counter to the elected government of [[Francisco I. Madero]] staged a successful coup. The center of the city was subjected to artillery attacks from the army stronghold of the ''ciudadela'' or citadel, with significant civilian casualties and the undermining of confidence in the Madero government. [[Victoriano Huerta]], chief general of the [[Huerta's Federal Army|Federal Army]], saw a chance to take power, forcing Madero and Pino Suarez to sign resignations. The two were murdered later while on their way to [[Palacio de Lecumberri|Lecumberri prison]].<ref name="redescolar">{{cite web |url = http://redescolar.ilce.edu.mx/redescolar/act_permanentes/historia/histdeltiempo/mexicana/sigloxx/xx_dece.htm |title = La Decena Trágica, febrero de 1913 |language = es |access-date = 19 October 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130620151846/http://redescolar.ilce.edu.mx/redescolar/act_permanentes/historia/histdeltiempo/mexicana/sigloxx/xx_dece.htm |archive-date = 20 June 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Huerta's ouster in July 1914 saw the entry of the armies of [[Pancho Villa]] and [[Emiliano Zapata]], but the city did not experience violence. Huerta had abandoned the capital and the conquering armies marched in. [[Venustiano Carranza]]'s [[Constitutionalist]] faction ultimately prevailed in the revolutionary civil war and Carranza took up residence in the presidential palace.

In the 20th century the phenomenal growth of the city and its environmental and political consequences dominate. In 1900, the population of Mexico City was about 500,000.<ref name="LaRosa 2005">{{Cite book |title = Atlas and Survey of Latin American History. |editor-last = LaRosa |editor-first = Michael J. |year = 2005 |publisher = M.E.

The rapid development of Mexico City as a center for [[modernist architecture]] was most fully manifested in the mid-1950s construction of the [[Ciudad Universitaria, Mexico City]], the main campus of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]. Designed by the most prestigious architects of the era, including [[Mario Pani]], [[Eugenio Peschard]], and [[Enrique del Moral]], the buildings feature murals by artists [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], and [[José Chávez Morado]]. It has since been recognized as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Central University City Campus of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1250/ |publisher=UNESCO |access-date=11 November 2023 |archive-date=29 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231029064104/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1250 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympic Games]] brought about the construction of large sporting facilities.<ref name="Enc Mex 2000" /> In 1969, the [[Mexico City Metro]] was inaugurated.<ref name="Ciudad Mexico" /> Explosive growth in the population of the city started in the 1960s, with the population overflowing the boundaries of the Federal District into the neighboring State of Mexico, especially to the north, northwest, and northeast. Between 1960 and 1980 the city's population more than doubled to nearly 9&nbsp;million.<ref name="Enc Mex 2000" />

In 1980, half of all the industrial jobs in Mexico were located in Mexico City. Under relentless growth, the Mexico City government could barely keep up with services. Villagers from the countryside who continued to pour into the city to escape poverty only compounded the city's problems. With no housing available, they took over lands surrounding the city, creating huge [[shanty town]]s.

The inhabitants of Mexico City faced serious [[air pollution in Mexico City|air pollution]] and [[water pollution]] problems, as well as [[groundwater-related subsidence]].<ref name="water">{{Cite book |title = Mexico City's Water Supply: Improving the Outlook for Sustainability. |author = National Research Council Staff |year = 1995 |publisher = National Academies Press |location = Washington, DC |page = 4 }}</ref> Air and water pollution has been contained and improved in several areas due to government programs, the renovation of vehicles and the modernization of public transportation.

The autocratic government that ruled Mexico City since the Revolution was tolerated, mostly because of the continued economic expansion since World War II. This was the case even though this government could not handle the population and pollution problems adequately. Nevertheless, discontent and protests began in the 1960s leading to the [[Tlatelolco massacre|massacre of an unknown number of protesting students]] in [[Tlatelolco (Mexico City)|Tlatelolco]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Doyle |first=Kate |date=May 29, 2023 |title=TLATELOLCO MASSACRE: DECLASSIFIED U.S. DOCUMENTS ON MEXICO AND THE EVENTS OF 1968 |url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB10/nsaebb10.htm |url-status=live |publisher=National Security Archive |access-date=30 May 2023 |archive-date=3 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230203130342/https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB10/nsaebb10.htm }}</ref>

Three years later, a demonstration in the Maestros avenue, organized by former members of the 1968 student movement, was violently repressed by a paramilitary group called "[[Los Halcones]]", composed of gang members and teenagers from many sports clubs who received training in the US.

However, the last straw may have been the controversial elections of 1988. That year, the presidency was set between the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|P.R.I.]]'s candidate, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, and a coalition of left-wing parties led by [[Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas]], son of the former president [[Lázaro Cárdenas]]. The counting system "fell" because coincidentally the power went out and suddenly, when it returned, the winning candidate was Salinas, even though Cárdenas had the upper hand.

As a result of the fraudulent election, Cárdenas became a member of the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]]. Discontent over the election eventually led [[Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas]] to become the first [[mayor|elected mayor]] of Mexico City in 1997. Cárdenas promised a more [[democracy|democratic government]], and his party claimed some victories against crime, pollution, and other major problems. He resigned in 1999 to run for the presidency.

Originally much of the valley lay beneath the waters of [[Lake Texcoco]], a system of interconnected salt and freshwater lakes. The [[Aztec]]s built dikes to separate the [[Freshwater|fresh water]] used to raise crops in ''[[chinampa]]s'' and to prevent recurrent floods. These dikes were destroyed during the siege of Tenochtitlan, and during colonial times the Spanish regularly drained the lake to prevent floods. Only a small section of the original lake remains, located outside Mexico City, in the municipality of [[San Salvador Atenco|Atenco]], [[State of Mexico]].

Architects [[Teodoro González de León]] and [[Alberto Kalach]] along with a group of Mexican urbanists, engineers and biologists have developed the project plan for ''Recovering the City of Lakes''. If approved by the government the project will contribute to the supply of water from natural sources to the [[Valley of Mexico]], the creation of new natural spaces, a great improvement in air quality, and greater population establishment planning.

By 2014 [[carbon monoxide]] pollution had dropped drastically, while [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[nitrogen dioxide]] were at levels about a third of those in 1992.

=== Climate ===
[[Image:B (70011807).jpeg|thumb|left|[[Lightning]] in the background of the [[Torre Mayor]]]]

Mexico City has a [[subtropical highland climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cwb''), due to its tropical location but high elevation. The lower region of the valley receives less rainfall than the upper regions of the south; the lower boroughs of [[Iztapalapa]], [[Iztacalco]], [[Venustiano Carranza, D.F.|Venustiano Carranza]] and the east portion of [[Gustavo A. Madero, D.F.|Gustavo A. Madero]] are usually drier and warmer than the upper southern boroughs of [[Tlalpan]] and [[Milpa Alta]], a mountainous region of [[pine]] and [[oak]] trees known as the range of [[Ajusco]]. The average annual temperature varies from {{convert|12|to|16|C|F|0}}, depending on the altitude of the borough. The temperature is rarely below {{convert|3|C|0}} or above {{convert|30|C|0}}.<ref name="weatherspark">{{cite web |title = Average Weather for Mexico City |url = http://weatherspark.com/averages/32574/Mexico-City-Distrito-Federal |publisher = Weather Spark |access-date = 29 October 2013 |archive-date = 5 November 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161105013644/https://weatherspark.com/averages/32574/Mexico-City-Distrito-Federal |url-status = live }}</ref> At the Tacubaya observatory, the lowest temperature ever registered was {{convert|−4.4|C|0}} on 13 February 1960, and the highest temperature on record was {{convert|34.7|C}} on 25 May 2024.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/politica/CDMX-rompe-por-segundo-dia-consecutivo-record-de-calor-alcanza-los-34.7-celsius-20240525-0034.html|title=CDMX rompe por segundo día consecutivo récord de calor; alcanza los 34.7° celsius|date=25 May 2024|access-date=26 May 2024|language=es|work=El Economista|archive-date=26 May 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240526152006/https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/politica/CDMX-rompe-por-segundo-dia-consecutivo-record-de-calor-alcanza-los-34.7-celsius-20240525-0034.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Overall precipitation is heavily concentrated in the summer months, and includes dense [[hail]].

Snow falls in the city scarcely, although somewhat more often on nearby mountaintops.

The area receives about {{convert|820|mm|in|0|sp=us}} of annual rainfall, which is concentrated from May through October with little or no precipitation for the remainder of the year.<ref name="National Research" /> The area has two main seasons. The wet humid summer runs from May to October when winds bring in tropical moisture from the sea, the wettest month being July. The cool sunny winter runs from November to April, when the air is relatively drier, the driest month being December. This season is subdivided into a cold winter period and a warm spring period. The cold period spans from November to February, when polar [[air mass]]es push down from the north and keep the air fairly dry. The warm period extends from March to May when subtropical winds again dominate but do not yet carry enough moisture for rain to form.<ref name="Lafragua 2003">{{Cite web |last = Lafregua |first = J |author2 = Gutierrez, A |author3=Aguilar E |author4=Aparicio J |author5=Mejia R |author6=Santillan O |author7=Suarez MA |author8=Preciado M |title = Balance hídrico del Valle de Mexico |publisher = Anuario IMTA |year = 2003 |url = http://www.imta.gob.mx/instituto/historial-proyectos/th/2003/HDR1-Balance.pdf |access-date = 1 December 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081216230728/http://www.imta.gob.mx/instituto/historial-proyectos/th/2003/HDR1-Balance.pdf |archive-date = 16 December 2008 }}</ref>

Historically, and since [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] times, the [[Valley of Mexico|Valley of Anahuac]] has been one of the most densely populated areas in Mexico. When the Federal District was created in 1824, the urban area of Mexico City extended approximately to the area of today's [[Cuauhtémoc, Mexico City|Cuauhtémoc borough]]. At the beginning of the 20th century, the ''elites''{{clarify|date=October 2024}} began migrating to the south and west and soon the small towns of [[Mixcoac]] and [[San Ángel]] were incorporated by the growing conurbation. According to the 1921 census, 54.78% of the city's population was considered Mestizo (Indigenous mixed with European), 22.79% considered European, and 18.74% considered Indigenous.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.houstonculture.org/hispanic/census.html |title = The Hispanic Experience – Indigenous Identity in Mexico |publisher = Houstonculture.org |access-date = 17 April 2011 |archive-date = 4 August 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090804090647/http://www.houstonculture.org/hispanic/census.html |url-status = live }}</ref>{{failed verification |date=October 2024}}

Up to the 1990s, the Federal District was the most populous [[Political divisions of Mexico|federal entity]] in Mexico, but since then, its population has remained stable at around 8.7&nbsp;million.

The metropolitan area, [[Greater Mexico City]] ('Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México' or 'ZMVM' in Spanish) consists of Mexico City itself plus 60 municipalities in the [[State of Mexico]] and one in [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo state]]. With a population of 21,804,515 (2020 census), Greater Mexico City is both the [[Metropolitan areas of Mexico|biggest]] and the densest metropolitan area in the country. Of the ca. 21.8 million, 9.2 million live in Mexico City proper<ref name="inegi_pop_2020" /> and 12.4 million in the State of Mexico (ca. 75% of the state's population), including the municipalities of:<ref name="inegi_pop_2020" />

====Megalopolis====
[[File:Megapolis Mexico Nombres.svg|thumb|The Mexico City Megalopolis as defined prior to 2019. Since then Querétaro state is also included.]]
Greater Mexico City, in turn, forms part of an even larger [[megalopolis]] officially known as the ''Corona regional del centro de México'' ([[Mexico City megalopolis]]), with a population of 33.4 million, more than one quarter of the country's population according to the 2020 census. The megalopolis as defined by the Environmental Commission of the Megalopolis (''CAMe'') covers Mexico City and the states of Mexico, Hidalgo, Puebla, Tlaxcala, Morelos, and since 2019, Querétaro,<ref name="qro-mega">{{cite news |title=Querétaro ya será parte de la megalópolis ('Querétaro will now be part of the megalopolis') |url=https://www.diariodequeretaro.com.mx/local/queretaro-ya-sera-parte-de-la-megalopolis-4363398.html |access-date=August 20, 2023 |publisher=Diario de Querétaro |date=October 25, 2019 |archive-date=20 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230820141049/https://www.diariodequeretaro.com.mx/local/queretaro-ya-sera-parte-de-la-megalopolis-4363398.html |url-status=live }}</ref> thus encompassing the metropolitan areas of Mexico City, [[Greater Puebla|Puebla]], [[Querétaro metropolitan area|Querétaro]], [[Greater Toluca|Toluca]], [[Cuernavaca]], [[Pachuca]], and others.<ref name="mega-came">{{cite web |author1=Comisión Ambiental de la Megalópolis |title=La megalópolis de la ZMVM (The Greater Mexico City Megalopolis) |url=https://www.gob.mx/comisionambiental/articulos/la-megalopolis-de-la-zmvm?idiom=es |website=Gobierno de Mexico (Government of Mexico) |publisher=Comisión Ambiental de la Megalópolis |access-date=August 20, 2023 |language=es |date=September 2018 |archive-date=20 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230820141047/https://www.gob.mx/comisionambiental/articulos/la-megalopolis-de-la-zmvm?idiom=es |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Growth====
Greater Mexico City was the fastest growing metropolitan area in the country until the late 1980s. Since then, government policies have supported decentralization with the aim of reducing pollution in Greater Mexico City. While still growing, the annual rate of growth has decreased and is lower than that of [[Greater Guadalajara]] and [[Greater Monterrey]].<ref name="Sintesis">[http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/proyectos/conteos/conteo2005/sintesis.pps Síntesis de Resultados del Conteo 2005] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209124039/http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/proyectos/conteos/conteo2005/sintesis.pps |date=9 February 2007 }} INEGI</ref>

In addition, some inner suburbs are losing population to outer suburbs, indicating the continuing expansion of Greater Mexico City.

In addition, Section XXVIII of Article 50 gave the new Congress the right to choose where the federal government would be located. This location would then be appropriated as federal land, with the federal government acting as the local authority. The two main candidates to become the capital were Mexico City and [[Querétaro, Querétaro|Querétaro]].<ref>[http://www.juridicas.unam.mx/publica/rev/boletin/cont/85/art/art13.htm Boletín Mexicano de Derecho Comparado] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410153948/http://www.juridicas.unam.mx/publica/rev/boletin/cont/85/art/art13.htm |date=10 April 2014 }}.

Due in large part to the persuasion of representative [[Servando Teresa de Mier]], Mexico City was chosen because it was the center of the country's population and history, even though [[Queretaro]] was closer to the center geographically. The choice was official on 18 November 1824, and Congress delineated a surface area of two leagues square (8,800 acres) centered on the [[Zócalo|Zocalo]]. This area was then separated from the [[State of Mexico]], forcing that state's government to move from the [[Palace of the Inquisition (Museum of Mexican Medicine)|Palace of the Inquisition (now Museum of Mexican Medicine)]] in the city to [[Texcoco, Mexico State|Texcoco]]. This area did not include the population centers of the towns of [[Coyoacán]], [[Xochimilco]], [[San Mateo Mexicaltzingo|Mexicaltzingo]] and [[Tlalpan]], all of which remained as part of the State of Mexico.<ref name="EncMex2003">{{cite encyclopedia |last = Alvarez |first = Jose Rogelio |encyclopedia = Enciclopedia de Mexico |title = Distrito Federal |year = 2003 |publisher = Sabeco International Investment Corp. |volume = IV |language=es |isbn = 978-1-56409-063-8 |pages = 2293–2314 }}</ref>

In 1854 president [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] enlarged the area of Mexico City almost eightfold from the original {{convert|220|to|1700|sqkm|sqmi|-1|abbr=on}}, annexing the rural and mountainous areas to secure the strategic mountain passes to the south and southwest to protect the city in event of a foreign invasion. (The [[Mexican–American War]] had just been fought.) The last changes to the limits of Mexico City were made between 1898 and 1902, reducing the area to the current {{convert|1479|sqkm|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} by adjusting the southern border with the state of [[Morelos]]. By that time, the total number of municipalities within Mexico City was twenty-two. In 1941, the [[Pedro María de Anaya|General Anaya]] borough was merged with the Central Department, which was then renamed "Mexico City" (thus reviving the name but not the autonomous municipality). From 1941 to 1970, the Federal District comprised twelve ''delegaciones'' and Mexico City. In 1970, Mexico City was split into four different ''delegaciones'': [[Cuauhtémoc, Mexico City|Cuauhtémoc]], [[Miguel Hidalgo, Mexico City|Miguel Hidalgo]], [[Venustiano Carranza, Mexico City|Venustiano Carranza]] and [[Benito Juárez, Mexico City|Benito Juárez]], increasing the number of ''delegaciones'' to 16. Since then, the whole Federal District, whose ''delegaciones'' had by then almost formed a single urban area, began to be considered ''de facto'' a synonym of Mexico City.<ref name="df.gob.mx">[http://www.df.gob.mx/leyes/normatividad.html?materia=1&apartado=15&disp=140 Statute of Government of the Federal District] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313061806/http://www.df.gob.mx/leyes/normatividad.html?materia=1&apartado=15&disp=140 |date=13 March 2008}}</ref>

The lack of a ''de jure'' stipulation left a legal vacuum that led to a number of sterile discussions about whether one concept had engulfed the other or if the latter had ceased to exist altogether. In 1993, the situation was solved by an amendment to the 44th article of the [[Constitution of Mexico]]; Mexico City and the Federal District were stated to be the same entity. The amendment was later introduced into the second article of the Statute of Government of the Federal District.<ref name="df.gob.mx" />

On 29 January 2016, Mexico City ceased to be the ''Federal District'' (Spanish: ''Distrito Federal'' or D.F.), and was officially renamed "Ciudad de México" (or "CDMX").<ref name="Federal District Now Officially" /> On that date, Mexico City began a transition to becoming the country's 32nd federal entity, giving it a level of autonomy comparable to that of a state. It will have its own constitution and its legislature, and its ''delegaciones'' will now be headed by mayors.<ref name="Federal District Now Officially" /> Because of a clause in the Mexican Constitution, however, as it is the seat of the powers of the federation, it can never become a state, or the capital of the country has to be relocated elsewhere.<ref name="UN2" />

In response to the demands, Mexico City received a greater degree of autonomy, with the 1987 elaboration the first Statute of Government (''Estatuto de Gobierno'') and the creation of an assembly of representatives.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tavera Fenollosa |first1=Ligia |editor1-last=Rossi |editor1-first=Federico M. |editor2-last=Bülow |editor2-first=Marisa von |title=Social Movement Dynamics: New Perspectives on Theory and Research from Latin America |date=3 March 2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-05370-5 |language=en |chapter=Eventful temporality and the unintended outcomes of Mexico's earthquake victims movement}}</ref>{{rp|pages=149–150}} The city has a Statute of Government, and as of its ratification on 31 January 2017, a [[:es:Constitución Política de la Ciudad de México|constitution]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Constitución Política de la Ciudad de México |url=http://www.infodf.org.mx/documentospdf/constitucion_cdmx/Constitucion_%20Politica_CDMX.pdf |access-date=16 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181226004223/http://www.infodf.org.mx/documentospdf/constitucion_cdmx/Constitucion_%20Politica_CDMX.pdf |archive-date=26 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Constitución Política de la Ciudad de México |url=http://gaceta.diputados.gob.mx/ACCM/GP/20170130-AA.pdf |access-date=16 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219175548/http://gaceta.diputados.gob.mx/ACCM/GP/20170130-AA.pdf |archive-date=19 February 2018 |date=30 January 2019}}</ref> similar to the states of the Union.

The Secretariat of Public Security of Mexico City (Secretaría de Seguridad Pública de la Ciudad de México – SSP) manages a combined force of over 90,000 officers in Mexico City. The SSP is charged with maintaining [[Public order crime|public order]] and safety in the heart of Mexico City. The historic district is also roamed by tourist police, aiming to orient and serve tourists. These horse-mounted agents dress in traditional uniforms. The investigative Judicial Police of Mexico City (Policía Judicial de la Ciudad de México – PJCDMX) is organized under the Office of the [[Attorney General of Mexico]] City (the Procuraduría General de Justicia de la Ciudad de México). The PGJCDMX maintains 16 precincts (delegaciones) with an estimated 3,500 judicial police, 1,100 investigating agents for prosecuting attorneys (agentes del ministerio público), and nearly 1,000 criminology experts or specialists (peritos).

Between 2000 and 2004 an average of 478 crimes were reported each day in Mexico City; however, the actual crime rate is thought to be much higher "since most people are reluctant to report crime".<ref>{{cite news|title=Police say Giuliani helps cut Mexico City crime |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/mexico/20040512-1639-crime-mexico.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040609044928/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/mexico/20040512-1639-crime-mexico.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 June 2004 |newspaper=San Diego Union-Tribune |date=12 May 2004 |access-date=15 September 2009 }}</ref> Under policies enacted by Mayor [[Marcelo Ebrard]] between 2009 and 2011, Mexico City underwent a major security upgrade with violent and petty crime rates both falling significantly despite the rise in violent crime in other parts of the country.

Mexico City is one of the most important economic hubs in [[Latin America]].

Mexico City is the greatest contributor to the country's industrial GDP (15.8%) and also the greatest contributor to the country's GDP in the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service sector]] (25.3%). Due to the limited non-urbanized space at the south—most of which is protected through environmental laws—the contribution of Mexico City in agriculture is the smallest of all federal entities in the country.<ref name="INEGI" /> The economic reforms of President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] had a tremendous effect on the city, as a number of businesses, including banks and airlines, were privatized. He also signed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA).

By contrast, corporate office buildings set their base in the city.

Mexico City offers an immense and varied consumer retail market, ranging from basic foods to ultra high-end luxury goods. Consumers may buy in [[Traditional fixed markets in Mexico|fixed indoor markets]], in [[tianguis|mobile markets (''tianguis'')]], from [[Street vendors in Mexico City|street vendors]], from downtown shops in a street dedicated to a certain type of good, in convenience stores and traditional neighborhood stores, in modern supermarkets, in warehouse and membership stores and the shopping centers that they anchor, in department stores, in [[big-box store]]s, and in modern shopping malls. In addition, "[[tianguis]]" or mobile markets set up shop on streets in many neighborhoods, depending on day of week. Sundays see the largest number of these markets.

The city's main source of fresh produce is the [[Central de Abasto]]. This in itself is a self-contained mini-city in [[Iztapalapa]] borough covering an area equivalent to several dozen city blocks. The wholesale market supplies most of the city's "mercados", supermarkets and restaurants, as well as people who come to buy the produce for themselves. Tons of fresh produce are trucked in from all over Mexico every day. The principal fish market is known as [[La Nueva Viga Market|La Nueva Viga]], in the same complex as the Central de Abastos.<ref name="actecon">{{cite web |url=http://www.iztapalapa.gob.mx/htm/0102040000_2005.html |title=Economía reciente, 1990-2005 |publisher=Borough of Iztapapala |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Economy |accessdate=March 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722225432/http://www.iztapalapa.gob.mx/htm/0102040000_2005.html |archivedate=July 22, 2011 }}</ref> The world-renowned market of [[Tepito]] occupies 25 blocks, and sells a variety of products. A staple for consumers in the city is the omnipresent "mercado". Every major neighborhood in the city has its own borough-regulated market, often more than one. These are large well-established facilities offering most basic products, such as fresh produce and meat/poultry, dry goods, tortillerías, and many other services such as locksmiths, herbal medicine, hardware goods, sewing implements; and a multitude of stands offering freshly made, home-style cooking and drinks in the tradition of [[aguas frescas]] and [[atole]].

Street vendors ply their trade from stalls in the ''tianguis'' as well as at non-officially controlled concentrations around metro stations and hospitals; at ''plazas comerciales'', where vendors of a certain "theme" (e.g. stationery) are housed; originally these were organized to accommodate vendors formerly selling on the street; or simply from improvised stalls on a city sidewalk.<ref name="pena">{{cite web |url=http://utminers.utep.edu/spena2/HABITAT%20V23(3)%20INFORMAL%20MARKETS.pdf |title=Informal Markets: Street Vendors in Mexico City |author=Sergio Peña |publisher=Florida State University |year=1999 |access-date=12 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304025356/https://utminers.utep.edu/spena2/HABITAT%20V23%283%29%20INFORMAL%20MARKETS.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 }}</ref> In addition, food and goods are sold from people walking with baskets, pushing carts, from bicycles or the backs of trucks, or simply from a tarp or cloth laid on the ground.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www3.diputados.gob.mx/camara/content/download/21212/105355/file/ITSDM001%20Comercio%20Ambulante.pdf |publisher = Cámara de Diputados (Mexico), Centro de Estudios Sociales y de Opinión Pública |title = Reporte Temático No. 2: Comercio Ambulante |date = June 2005 |access-date = 9 April 2014 |archive-date = 13 April 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140413145720/http://www3.diputados.gob.mx/camara/content/download/21212/105355/file/ITSDM001%20Comercio%20Ambulante.pdf |url-status = live }}</ref> In the center of the city informal street vendors are increasingly targeted by laws and prosecution.<ref name="mueller" /> The weekly [[San Felipe de Jesús Tianguis]] is reported to be the largest in Latin America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.maspormas.com/ciudad/tianguis-la-san-felipe-no-podras-recorrerlo-dia/|title=Tianguis de la San Felipe: no podrás recorrerlo en un día|date=23 January 2017|publisher=Máspormás|access-date=21 August 2017|archive-date=21 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821090406/https://www.maspormas.com/ciudad/tianguis-la-san-felipe-no-podras-recorrerlo-dia/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Historic Center of Mexico City]] is widely known for specialized, often low-cost retailers. Certain blocks or streets are dedicated to shops selling a certain type of merchandise, with areas dedicated to over 40 categories such as home appliances, lamps and electricals, closets and bathrooms, housewares, wedding dresses, jukeboxes, printing, office furniture and safes, books, photography, jewelry, and opticians.<ref>{{cite journal |journal = Km.cero |url = http://guiadelcentrohistorico.mx/sites/default/files/km40_0.pdf |date = November 2011 |title = Calles con vocación |page = 7 |access-date = 9 April 2014 |archive-date = 22 May 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140522233249/http://guiadelcentrohistorico.mx/sites/default/files/km40_0.pdf |url-status = live }}</ref>

===Tourism===
{{See also|Barrios Mágicos of Mexico City}}
[[File:Turibus Ciudad de Mexico.jpg|thumb|upright|The Turibus runs through many of the most important tourist attractions in the city.]]

Mexico City is a destination for many foreign tourists. The [[Historic center of Mexico City]] (''Centro Histórico'') and the "floating gardens" of [[Xochimilco]] in the southern borough have been declared [[World Heritage Site]]s by [[UNESCO]]. Landmarks in the Historic Center include the [[Zócalo|Plaza de la Constitución]] (Zócalo), the main central square with its epoch-contrasting Spanish-era [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]] and [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]], ancient Aztec temple ruins [[Templo Mayor]] ("Major Temple") and modern structures, all within a few steps of one another. (The Templo Mayor was discovered in 1978 while workers were digging to place underground electric cables).

The most recognizable icon of Mexico City is the golden [[Angel of Independence]] on the wide, elegant avenue [[Paseo de la Reforma]], modeled by the order of the Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian of Mexico]] after the [[Champs-Élysées]] in Paris. This avenue was designed over the Americas' oldest known major roadway in the 19th century to connect the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] (seat of government) with the [[Chapultepec Castle|Castle of Chapultepec]], the imperial residence. Today, this avenue is an important financial district in which the [[Mexican Stock Exchange]] and several [[corporate headquarters]] are located. Another important avenue is the [[Avenida de los Insurgentes]], which extends {{convert|28.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} and is one of the longest single avenues in the world.

[[Chapultepec]] Park houses the [[Chapultepec Castle]], now a museum on a hill that overlooks the park and its numerous museums, monuments and the national zoo and the [[Museo Nacional de Antropología|National Museum of Anthropology]] (which houses the [[Aztec calendar stone|Aztec Calendar Stone]]). 
[[File:Aztec_Stone_of_the_Sun_(2088976462).jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Aztec sun stone]] in the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Mexico)|National Museum of Anthropology]]]]

Another piece of architecture is the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]], a white marble theater/museum whose weight is such that it has gradually been sinking into the soft ground below. Its construction began during the presidency of [[Porfirio Díaz]] and ended in 1934, after being interrupted by the [[Mexican Revolution]] in the 1920s.

The [[Plaza de las Tres Culturas]], in this square are located the [[Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco|College of Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco]], that is [[List of oldest buildings in the Americas|the first and oldest]] European school of higher learning in the [[Americas]],<ref name="catalog.hathitrust.org">{{cite book|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/101392426|title=The first college in America: Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco.|location=Washington DC|year=1936|author1=Steck|author2=Francis Borgia|series=Achievement and influence of Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco|access-date=10 October 2019|archive-date=27 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190927215841/https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/101392426|url-status=live}}</ref> and the archeological site of the [[Tlatelolco (archaeological site)|city-state of Tlatelolco]], and the shrine and [[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe]] are also important sites. There is a [[double-decker bus]], known as the "Turibus", that circles most of these sites, and has timed audio describing the sites in multiple languages as they are passed.

In addition, according to the Secretariat of Tourism, the city has about 170 [[museums]]—is among the top ten of cities in the world with highest number of museums<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/cultura/patrimonio/2016/05/17/cdmx-una-de-las-urbes-con-mas-museos-en-el-mundo|title=CDMX, una de las urbes con más museos en el mundo|date=17 May 2016|website=[[El Universal (Mexico City)]]|access-date=11 October 2019|archive-date=16 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191016232312/https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/cultura/patrimonio/2016/05/17/cdmx-una-de-las-urbes-con-mas-museos-en-el-mundo|url-status=live}}</ref>—over 100 [[art museum|art galleries]], and some 30 [[List of concert halls|concert halls]], all of which maintain a constant cultural activity during the whole year. Many areas (e.g. Palacio Nacional and the [[National Institute of Cardiology]]) have murals painted by [[Diego Rivera]]. He and his wife [[Frida Kahlo]] lived in [[Coyoacán]], where several of their homes, studios, and art collections are open to the public. The house where [[Leon Trotsky]] was initially granted asylum and finally murdered in 1940 is also in Coyoacán. In addition, there are several ''[[hacienda]]s'' that are now restaurants, such as the San Ángel Inn, the Hacienda de Tlalpan, Hacienda de Cortés and the Hacienda de los Morales.

[[File:Al benemerito Benito Juarez, Ciudad de México MEX.jpg|thumb|Monument "To the Meritorious [[Benito Juárez]]", Mexico City]]

Secular works of art of this period include the [[equestrian statue|equestrian sculpture]] of [[Charles IV of Spain]], locally known as ''El Caballito'' ("The little horse"). This piece, in bronze, was the work of [[Manuel Tolsá]] and it has been placed at the [[Plaza Tolsá]], in front of the [[Palacio de Mineria]] (Mining Palace). Directly in front of this building is the [[Museo Nacional de Arte]] (Munal) (the National Museum of Art).

[[File:ReceptHallMUNAL.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Receptions Hall at the [[Museo Nacional de Arte]]]]
During the 19th century, an important producer of art was the [[Academy of San Carlos|Academia de San Carlos]] (San Carlos Art Academy), founded during colonial times, and which later became the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas (the [[National School of Arts (UNAM)|National School of Arts]]) including painting, sculpture and graphic design, one of UNAM's [[art school]]s. Many of the works produced by the students and faculty of that time are now displayed in the Museo Nacional de San Carlos ([[National Museum of San Carlos]]). One of the students, [[José María Velasco Gómez|José María Velasco]], is considered one of the greatest Mexican landscape painters of the 19th century. [[Porfirio Díaz]]'s regime sponsored arts, especially those that followed the French school. Popular arts in the form of cartoons and illustrations flourished, e.g. those of [[José Guadalupe Posada]] and [[Manuel Manilla]]. The permanent collection of the San Carlos Museum also includes paintings by European masters such as Rembrandt, Velázquez, Murillo, and Rubens.

After the [[Mexican Revolution]], an [[avant-garde]] [[art movement|artistic movement]] originated in Mexico City: [[mural]]ism. Many of the works of muralists [[José Clemente Orozco]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Diego Rivera]] are displayed in numerous buildings in the city, most notably at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] and the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]]. [[Frida Kahlo]], wife of Rivera, with a strong nationalist expression, was also one of the most renowned of Mexican painters. Her house has become a museum that displays many of her works.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.museofridakahlo.org.mx/en/the-blue-house/#back-top|title=The Blue House – Frida Kahlo Museum|website=www.museofridakahlo.org.mx|language=en-US|access-date=2 October 2018|archive-date=2 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002102344/http://www.museofridakahlo.org.mx/en/the-blue-house/#back-top|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The former home of Rivera muse [[Dolores Olmedo]] houses the namesake museum. The facility is in Xochimilco borough in southern Mexico City and includes several buildings surrounded by sprawling manicured lawns. It houses a large collection of Rivera and Kahlo paintings and drawings, as well as living ''Xoloizcuintles'' ([[Mexican Hairless Dog]]). It also regularly hosts small but important temporary exhibits of classical and [[modern art]] (e.g. Venetian Masters and Contemporary New York artists).

During the 20th century, many artists immigrated to Mexico City from different regions of Mexico, such as [[Leopoldo Méndez]], an engraver from Veracruz, who supported the creation of the socialist Taller de la Gráfica Popular ([[Popular Graphics Workshop]]), designed to help [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] workers find a venue to express their art. Other painters came from abroad, such as [[Catalonia|Catalan]] painter [[Remedios Varo]] and other Spanish and Jewish exiles. It was in the second half of the 20th century that the artistic movement began to drift apart from the Revolutionary theme. [[José Luis Cuevas]] opted for a modernist style in contrast to the muralist movement associated with social politics.

Mexico City has numerous museums dedicated to art, including Mexican colonial, modern and [[contemporary art]], and international art. The Museo Tamayo was opened in the mid-1980s to house the collection of international contemporary art donated by Mexican painter [[Rufino Tamayo]]. The collection includes pieces by Picasso, Klee, Kandinsky, Warhol and many others, though most of the collection is stored while visiting exhibits are shown. The [[Museo de Arte Moderno]] is a repository of Mexican artists from the 20th century, including Rivera, Orozco, Siqueiros, Kahlo, [[Gunther Gerzso|Gerzso]], Carrington, Tamayo, and also regularly hosts temporary exhibits of international modern art. In southern Mexico City, the [[Carrillo Gil Museum]] showcases avant-garde artists, as does the [[Museo Universitario Arte Contemporáneo]], designed by Mexican architect [[Teodoro González de León]], inaugurated in late 2008.

The [[Museo Soumaya]], named after the wife of Mexican magnate [[Carlos Slim]], has the largest private collection of original [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] sculptures outside of France.<ref>{{Cite web|first1=Jo|last1=Tuckman|date=2 March 2011|title=Mexican billionaire's new museum gives The Thinker much to ponder|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/02/carlos-slim-mexico-art-museum|access-date=30 October 2021|website=The Guardian|language=en|archive-date=4 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211104064301/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/02/carlos-slim-mexico-art-museum|url-status=live}}</ref> It also has a large collection of [[Dalí]] sculptures, and recently began showing pieces in its masters collection including [[El Greco]], [[Velázquez]], [[Picasso]] and [[Canaletto]]. The museum inaugurated a new futuristic-design facility in 2011 just north of Polanco, while maintaining a smaller facility in [[Museo Soumaya#Plaza Loreto|Plaza Loreto]] in southern Mexico City. The [[Colección Júmex]] is a contemporary art museum located on the sprawling grounds of the [[Jumex]] juice company in the northern industrial suburb of [[San Cristóbal Ecatepec|Ecatepec]]. It has the largest private contemporary art collection in [[Latin America]] and hosts pieces from its permanent collection as well as traveling exhibits. The Museo de San Ildefonso, housed in the [[Colegio de San Ildefonso, Mexico City|Antiguo Colegio de San Ildefonso]] in Mexico City's historic downtown district is a 17th-century colonnaded palace housing an art museum that regularly hosts world-class exhibits of Mexican and international art. The [[Museo Nacional de Arte]] is also located in a former palace in the historic center. It houses a large collection of pieces by all major Mexican artists of the last 400 years and also hosts visiting exhibits.

[[Jack Kerouac]], the noted American author, spent extended periods of time in the city, and wrote his 1959 masterpiece volume of poetry ''[[Mexico City Blues]]'' here. Another American author, [[William S. Burroughs]], also lived in [[Colonia Roma]] where he accidentally shot his wife. Most of Mexico City's museums can be visited from Tuesday to Sunday from 10am to 5pm, although some of them have extended schedules, such as the Museum of Anthropology and History, which is open to 7pm. In addition to this, entrance to most museums are free on Sunday. In some cases a modest fee may be charged.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.mexicocity.com.mx/visita.html |title = Ciudad de México.- atractivos turísticos |publisher = Mexicocity.com.mx |access-date = 17 April 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090225110752/http://www.mexicocity.com.mx/visita.html |archive-date = 25 February 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The [[Memory and Tolerance Museum]], inaugurated in 2011, showcases historical events of discrimination and genocide.

[[File:Street_tacos_in_Mexico_City_(8495923877).jpg|thumb|[[Street food|Street]] [[tacos]] in Mexico City]]

Once considered plebeian fare, by the 19th century [[taco]]s had become a standard of Mexico City's cuisine. Furthermore, as authorities struggled to tax local [[taquerias]], imposing licensing requirements and penalties, they recorded some details of the types of foods being served by these establishments. The most frequent reference was for ''tacos de [[barbacoa]]''. Also mentioned are [[enchiladas]], ''tacos de minero'' and ''[[gorditas]]'', along with oyster shops and fried fish stands. There is evidence of some regional specialties being made available for recent migrants; at least two shops were known to serve ''[[pozole]]'', a type of stew similar to [[hominy]] that is a staple of [[Guadalajara]], [[Jalisco]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Pilcher |first=Jeffrey M. |title=Planet Taco: A Global History of Mexican Food |page=94}}</ref> Mexico City is known for having some of the freshest fish and seafood in Mexico's interior.
