'''Maluku''' is a [[Provinces of Indonesia|province of Indonesia]]. It comprises the central and southern regions of the [[Maluku Islands]]. The largest city and capital of Maluku province is [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]] on the small [[Ambon Island]]. It is directly adjacent to [[North Maluku]], [[Southwest Papua]], and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]] in the north, [[Central Sulawesi]], and [[Southeast Sulawesi]] in the west, [[Banda Sea]], [[Australia]], [[East Timor]] and [[East Nusa Tenggara]] in the south and [[Arafura Sea]], [[Central Papua]] and [[South Papua]] in the east. The land area is 57803.81 km<sup>2</sup>, and the total population of this province at the 2010 census was 1,533,506 people,<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> rising to 1,848,923 at the 2020 census,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as at mid 2023 (actually, the sum of the official mid-year estimates for all the cities and regencies) was 1,908,753.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2023">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2023, ''Provinsi Maluku Dalam Angka 2023'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.81)</ref> Maluku is located in Eastern Indonesia.

Maluku has two main religions, namely [[Islam]] which at the 2020 census was adhered to by 52.85% of the population of the province and Christianity which is embraced by 46.3% (39.4% [[Protestantism]] and 7.0% [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]).<ref name="AGAMA"/>

All the Maluku Islands were part of a single province from 1950 until 1999. In 1999, the northern part of Maluku (then comprising the [[North Maluku|Maluku Utara Regency]], the [[Central Halmahera Regency|Halmahera Tengah Regency]] and the City of [[Ternate]]) were split off to form a separate province of [[North Maluku]] ({{lang|id|Maluku Utara}}), separated from the remaining (South) Maluku Province by the [[Seram Sea]].

== Etymology ==
Historically, the term Maluku referred to the four royal centers in North Maluku, namely [[Sultanate of Ternate|Ternate]], [[Tidore Sultanate|Tidore]], [[Bacan Islands|Bacan]] and [[Sultanate of Jailolo|Jailolo]]. A type of confederation consisting of the four kingdoms, which most likely emerged in the 14th century, was called Moloku Kie Raha or "The Four Mountains of Maluku".<ref>C.F. van Fraassen 1987 Ternate, de Molukken en de Indonesische Archipel. Leiden: Rijksmuseum te Leiden, Vol. I, p. 18.</ref> Although the four kingdoms subsequently expanded and covered the entire North Maluku region (as now defined) and parts of [[Sulawesi]] and [[New Guinea]], the area of expansion was originally not included in the term Maluku. This only referred to the four main clove-producing islands to the west of [[Halmahera]]: Ternate, Tidore. [[Moti Island|Moti]] and [[Makian]]. Bacan further to the south, and Jailolo on Halmahera, were also commonly included in Maluku Proper, the four kingdoms forming a ritual quadripartition with connotations to local cosmology.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen 1987, Vol. I, p. 18.</ref>

The etymology of the word ''Maluku'' is not very clear, and it has been a matter of debate for many experts.<ref>Leonard Andaya 1993 ''The world of Maluku''. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, p. 47.</ref> The first recorded word that can be identified with ''Maluku'' comes from [[Nagarakretagama]], an [[Old Javanese]] eulogy of 1365. Canto 14 stanza 5 mentioned ''Maloko'', which Pigeaud identified with [[Ternate]] or Moluccas.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pigeaud |first=Theodoor Gautier Thomas |title=Java in the 14th Century: A Study in Cultural History, Volume III: Translations |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |year=1960c |isbn=978-94-011-8772-5 |edition=3rd revised |location=The Hague}}</ref>{{rp|17}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Pigeaud |first=Theodoor Gautier Thomas |title=Java in the 14th Century: A Study in Cultural History, Volume IV: Commentaries and Recapitulations |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |year=1962 |isbn=978-94-017-7133-7 |edition=3rd revised |location=The Hague}}</ref>{{rp|34}} A theory holds that the name Maluku comes from the concept of "Maluku Kie Raha". "Raha" means four, while "kie" here means mountain, referring to 4 mountains of Ternate, Tidore, Bacan, and Jailolo (Halmahera), which have their own kolano (title for local kings). Therefore, the Maluku can come from: "Moloku" here meaning to grasp or hold. In this context, the meaning of "Moloku Kie Raha" is "the confederation of four mountains". However, the root word "loku" comes from local Malay creole word for a unit, therefore not from an indigenous language. The other possibility is that the word "Maloko" is a combination of "Ma", meaning "support" and "Loko" referring to the area. The phrase "Maloko Kie Raha" means "the place/world which has four mountains".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Amal|first1=Muhammad A.|title=Kepulauan Rempah-rempah|date=2016|publisher=Gramedia|location=Jakarta|isbn= 978-6024241667}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Pre-colonial era ===
The region was first settled by [[Melanesians]] at least 40,000 years ago, collectively now known as the Alifuru tribes.These people are the indigenous inhabitants of Maluku, along with the later Austronesian migration.

At the beginning of the 14th century the [[Majapahit]] Kingdom ruled maritime Southeast Asia. At that time, traders from Java monopolized the spice trade in Maluku.

During the [[Ming dynasty]], spices from Maluku were introduced in various works of art and history. In a painting by W.P. Groeneveldt, titled Gunung Dupa, Maluku, is described as a green mountainous region filled with cloves – an oasis in the middle of the southeastern sea. [[Marco Polo]] also described the clove trade in Maluku during his visit to [[Sumatra]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Indonesia |first=Kementerian Pendidikan, Kebudayaan, Riset, dan Teknologi Republik |title=Jalur Rempah Nusantara |url=https://jalurrempah.kemdikbud.go.id/artikel/jejak-perdagangan-jalur-rempah-di-kepulauan-maluku-dan-awal-kedatangan-bangsa-barat |access-date=2024-08-29 |website=jalurrempah.kemdikbud.go.id |language=id}}</ref>

Before the arrival of European colonials, the Maluku islands had been ruled by several sultanates that played an important role in the spice trade, especially cloves and nutmeg. In the Maluku region, four major sultanates – [[Sultanate of Ternate|Ternate]], [[Sultanate of Tidore|Tidore]], [[Sultanate of Jailolo|Jailolo]], and [[Sultanate of Bacan|Bacan]] – formed a power structure known as the '''“''Moloku Kie Raha'',”''' or '''“Four Mountains of Maluku.”'''<ref>{{Cite journal |date=2024 |title=Moloku Kie Raha Community and Their Old Manuscript Heritage |url=https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/175/1/012059#:~:text=Moloku%20Kie%20Raha%20Community%20and%20Their%20Old%20Manuscript%20Heritage%20-%20IOPscience |access-date=30 August 2024 |journal=IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science |publisher=IOP Publishing|doi=10.1088/1755-1315/175/1/012059 |last1=Pudjiastuti |first1=Titik |volume=175 |page=012059 }}</ref> The four had dynamic relationships, both alliances and rivalries, that played a vital role in maintaining stability and prosperity in the region, especially through the valuable spice trade.<ref>{{Cite book |date=1994 |title=Halmahera and Beyond: Social Science Research in the Moluccas|url=https://books.google.co.id/books/about/Halmahera_and_Beyond.htmlid=athwAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y|access-date=30 August 2024 |publisher=KITLVPress|location=Leiden|editor=Leontine E.

The [[Sultanate of Ternate]] was one of the most influential sultanates in Maluku and played an important role in the clove trade that connected Maluku with traders from Asia and the Middle East. Founded around the 13th century, Ternate developed into a center of maritime power and the spread of Islam in the eastern part of the archipelago. This sultanate established strong diplomatic relations with major kingdoms in Southeast Asia, such as the Sultanate of Malacca and the Majapahit Kingdom, strengthening its position in international trade routes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ternate & Tidore : Volcanic Island of Cloves |url=https://artsandculture.google.com/story/ternate-amp-tidore-volcanic-island-of-cloves/6gUx_mYEq8OxgA?hl=en |access-date=2024-11-01 |website=Google Arts & Culture |language=en}}</ref> Under the rule of famous sultans such as [[Babullah of Ternate|Sultan Baabullah]], Ternate was even able to expel the Portuguese and maintain its sovereignty, which made it a symbol of strength and independence in Maluku.<ref>Victor Lieberman (2009) ''Strange parallels: Southeast Asia in global contexts, c. 800-1830''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 853-4.</ref>

The [[Sultanate of Tidore]] , which grew in almost the same period, also played an important role in Maluku. Like Ternate, Tidore developed a formidable maritime power and had extensive diplomatic relations, including with areas in the Southern Philippines. Tidore had a strong military tradition and often formed alliances with kingdoms in the northern region to face external threats, especially from European powers such as Portugal and Spain.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ternate & Tidore : Volcanic Island of Cloves |url=https://artsandculture.google.com/story/ternate-amp-tidore-volcanic-island-of-cloves/6gUx_mYEq8OxgA?hl=en |access-date=2024-11-01 |website=Google Arts & Culture |language=en}}</ref> Under the rule of [[Nuku of Tidore|Sultan Nuku]], Tidore built local alliances and waged resistance that succeeded in maintaining its sovereignty while maintaining control over the spice trade.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 237.</ref>

Meanwhile, the Jailolo Sultanate and the Bacan Sultanate also played a significant role in maintaining political and social balance in Maluku. [[Sultanate of Jailolo]], as one of the oldest sultanates, has a very rich cultural tradition and is a spiritual and cultural center that is respected among the people of Maluku. During its heyday, Jailolo became a respected local power, with influence not only on political aspects but also social and cultural aspects.<ref>R.Z. Leirissa (1984), p. 185-8.</ref> The [[Sultanate of Bacan]], although not as large as Ternate and Tidore, had a strategic role in trade routes and became an important supporter of the two sultanates, strengthening the defense system and relations with communities in the southern region.<ref>A.B. Lapian (1994) "Bacan and the early history of North. Maluku", in L. Visser (ed.), ''Halmahera and beyond: Social science research in the Moluccas''. Leiden: KITLV Press.</ref>

These four sultanates , through the ''Moloku Kie Raha'' system, demonstrated a bond of unity in the face of external threats and in managing the economic and cultural potential of Maluku. Although Ternate and Tidore often stand out in the role of trade and resistance to foreign powers, Jailolo and Bacan remain an important part of this structure, both as a balancing force and as a symbol of Maluku's cultural diversity. Their cooperation and competition illustrate the complexity of local politics that helped maintain Maluku's identity and sovereignty for centuries, making this region a unique center of the spice trade in the world.<ref>kompas.id (November 8, 2017). "Maluku Kie Raha dari Negeri Teluk". ''Jelajah Kompas'' (in Indonesian). Retrieved November 1, 2024.</ref>

The era of the sultanate began to change drastically with the arrival of the Portuguese in the early 16th century, followed by the Spanish, Dutch, and then the British. European penetration in the region led to the weakening of local power and major changes in the political and economic structure of Maluku.<ref>{{cite web |last=Leirissa |first=R.Z. |date=1982 |title=Sistem Pertahanan di Maluku Abad XVII-XVIII |url=https://media.neliti.com/media/publications/143507-ID-sistem-pertahanan-di-maluku-abad-xvii-xi.pdf |accessdate=2024-08-29 |publisher=Jakarta: Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, Direktorat Jenderal Kebudayaan |language=id}}</ref>

=== Colonial era ===
[[File:AMH-7207-KB Beheading of Moluccan 'mutineers' in Fort Victoria on Ambon in 1653.jpg|thumb|Beheading of Moluccan 'mutineers' by the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] at Fort Victoria on Ambon in 1653.]]
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Baai met passagiersschepen en prauwen Molukken TMnr 60026901.jpg|thumb|Dutch ships in Maluku during the colonial era]]
The first Europeans to arrive in Maluku were the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], in 1512. At that time two Portuguese fleets, under the leadership of [[António de Abreu]] and [[Francisco Serrão]], landed in the [[Banda Islands]] and the [[Penyu Islands]]. After they established relations with local residents and kings, such as the [[Sultanate of Ternate]] on the island of [[Ternate]], the Portuguese were given permission to build fortifications in Pikaoli, as well as the old Hitu State, and Mamala on [[Ambon Island]]. The Portuguese gained a monopoly while at the same time carrying out the spread of [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]].

One of the famous missionaries was [[Francis Xavier]]. Arriving in Ambon on February 14, 1546, then traveling to Ternate, arriving in 1547, visiting islands in the Maluku Islands to spread [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]].

The relationship between the Portuguese and Ternatean broke down in 1570, [[Portuguese-Ternate wars|resulting in a war]] with Sultan [[Babullah of Ternate|Babullah]] that lasted for 5 years (1570–1575), causing the Portuguese to be expelled from Ternate and were driven to [[Tidore]] and Ambon.

The resistance of the Moluccas to the Portuguese was used by the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] to gain a foothold in Maluku. In 1605, the Dutch managed to force the Portuguese to surrender their defenses in Ambon to [[Steven van der Hagen]] and at Tidore to the Sebastiansz Cornelisz. Similarly, the British fortress in Kambelo, [[Seram Island]], was destroyed by the Dutch. Giving the Dutch control of most of the Maluku region.

The Dutch position in Maluku grew stronger with the establishment of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) in 1602, and since then [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]] has become the sole ruler in Maluku. Under the leadership of [[Jan Pieterszoon Coen]], Chief of Operations of the VOC, the clove trade in Maluku was under VOC control for almost 350 years. For this purpose, the VOC did not hesitate to expel the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and the [[British Empire|British]]. Tens of thousands of Moluccans were victims of VOC brutality.

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], British forces captured Maluku as the Netherlands were under [[First French Empire|French]] occupation. After the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]], the British returned Maluku to the Dutch. The Dutch returned in 1817.

The return of the Dutch in 1817 evoked strong resistance from the Moluccans. This was due to political, economic and social relations conditions that had been bad for two centuries. Moluccan people of the Ambon Islands rose up and took up arms under the leadership of [[Thomas Matulessy]] who was given the title Kapitan Pattimura, a former major sergeant of the British army.

On May 15, 1817, an attack was launched against [[Fort Duurstede]] on [[Saparua]] island, resulting in the death of Resident Johannes Rudolph van den Berg and his family.<ref name="dbnl">Peter van Zonneveld (1995)[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_ind004199501_01/_ind004199501_01_0005.php Pattimura en het kind van Saparua.

The news of this Pattimura's victory aroused the spirit of popular resistance throughout Maluku. Paulus Tiahahu and his daughter [[Martha Christina Tiahahu]]<ref name="Kusumaputra"/> fought the Dutch on [[Nusa Laut]], and Kapitan Ulupaha in Ambon.

But this resistance was crushed by the Dutch, being heavily outnumbered. On December 16, 1817, Pattimura and his colleagues were sentenced to death on the gallows, at Fort Niew Victoria, Ambon, while [[Martha Christina Tiahahu]]<ref name="Kusumaputra" /> died on the boat during her voyage to Java and her body was released into the Banda Sea.

=== Modern era ===
[[File:Ambon refugees, 1999.jpg|thumb|Indonesian military forces evacuate refugees of the Ambon religious riots.]]
Following the outbreak of the [[Pacific War]] on December 7, 1941, as part of [[World War II]] the region was [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|occupied by the Japanese]]. The Japanese [[Battle of Ambon|attacked on 31 January 1942]], landing at Hutu beach on the north coast, and Ritung beach in the south. They were opposed by soldiers of the [[KNIL]] and a small Australian contingent. The KNIL commander was captured the day after the attack, and the last defenders of the airfield were overcome a few days later.{{sfn|Chauvel|1990|p=173}}{{sfn|War History Office of the National Defense College of Japan|2016|p=372}} The battle was followed by the [[summary execution]] of more than 300 Allied [[Prisoner of War|PoWs]] in the [[Battle of Ambon#Laha massacre|Laha massacre]].

On August 15, 1945, Japan [[Surrender of Japan|capitulated]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]]. Two days later, the [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Proclamation of Independence of Indonesia]] was declared. Maluku was declared as one of the provinces of the Republic of Indonesia. However, the formation and position of Maluku was forced to take place in [[Jakarta]], as after the Japanese surrender, the [[Netherlands Indies Civil Administration]] (NICA) immediately re-entered Maluku to assume control. The Dutch controlled Maluku until 1949, when in accordance to the [[Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference]], the Dutch recognize sovereignty of Indonesia. The Dutch soon left Maluku. Due to a deep distrust of the Indonesian leadership, which was predominantly Javanese [[Muslim]], in 1951 an independent [[Republic of the South Moluccas]] ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: RMS, Republik Maluku Selatan) was proclaimed at Ambon. The RMS had strong support among the former Moluccans [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army|colonial soldiers]]. Indonesian forces invaded Maluku to crush the separatists. The main stronghold of the RMS on Ambon [[Invasion of Ambon|was defeated]] by Indonesian forces in November 1950, while a smaller scale guerilla struggle continued on Seram Island until 1962. The defeat on Ambon however resulted in the flight of the self-declared RMS government from the islands, and the formation of a [[government in exile]] in the Netherlands. The following year some 12,000 Moluccan soldiers accompanied by their families went to the Netherlands.

In April and May 1958 during the [[Permesta]] rebellion in [[North Sulawesi]], the [[United States|USA]] supported and supplied the rebels. Pilots from a [[Taiwan]]-based [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] front organisation, [[Civil Air Transport]], flying CIA [[Douglas A-26 Invader|B-26 Invader]] aircraft, repeatedly raided targets on Ambon. From April 27 until 18 May there were [[Ambon, Maluku#Conflicts since independence|CIA air raids on Ambon city]]. On May 8, 1958, CIA pilot [[Allen Lawrence Pope|Allen Pope]] raided the [[Indonesian Air Force]] base at Liang in the northeast of the island, damaging the runway and destroying a [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]].{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=122}} The Indonesian Air Force had only one serviceable fighter aircraft on Ambon Island, a [[North American P-51 Mustang]] at Liang. Pope's last air raid was on 18 May, when an Indonesian pilot at Liang, Captain Ignatius Dewanto, was scrambled to the P-51.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=136}} Pope had attacked [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon city]] before Dewanto could catch him, but Dewanto intercepted him just as Pope was attacking a pair of troop ships in an Indonesian fleet west of Ambon Island.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=138}} The B-26 was brought down by fire from both Dewanto and anti-aircraft gunners on board the ship.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=139}} Pope and his Indonesian radio operator bailed and were captured,{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|pp=139, 141}} which immediately exposed the level of CIA support for the Permesta rebellion. Embarrassed, the [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower administration]] quickly ended CIA support for Permesta and withdrew its agents and remaining aircraft from the conflict.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=143}}

The [[Maluku sectarian conflict]] broke out across Maluku in January 1999.

==Geography==
Maluku is bordered by [[North Maluku]] in the north, [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]] in the East, [[Southeast Sulawesi]] and [[Central Sulawesi]] in the West, and the nation of [[East Timor|Timor-Leste]] and Australia in the south. While the total area consists of 527,191 km<sup>2</sup> of sea area, and 57,803.81 km<sup>2</sup> of land area, or in other words around 90% of Maluku is sea area. As an archipelago province, Maluku has 559 islands, which include some relatively large islands: [[Seram Island|Seram]] (18,625 km<sup>2</sup>), [[Buru]] (9,000 km<sup>2</sup>) [[Yamdena]] (5,085 km<sup>2</sup>) and [[Wetar]] (3,624 km<sup>2</sup>). 

Most of the province's islands lie along two mainly submerged oceanic ridges which form the  eastwards extension of the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]; the inner arc runs from [[Wetar Island]] through the [[Romang Island]]s and [[Damar Island]] (with its northeasterly outliers) to end at the [[Banda Islands]]; the outer arc extends from the Wetar Strait through [[Kisar Island]], the [[Letti Islands]], the [[Mdona Hyera|Sermata Islands]], the [[Babar Islands]], the [[Tanimbar Islands]], the [[Kei Islands]] (more precisely, the [[Kur Island]] group in the west of the Kei Islands), the [[Watubela Islands]] and the [[Gorong Islands]], ending with [[Seram Island]] and [[Buru Island]]. With the dominant condition of regional waters, Maluku is very open to interacting with other provinces and surrounding countries.

The Maluku islands have a tropical monsoon climate, this climate is greatly influenced by the presence of vast marine waters and takes place in tune with the climatic season there. The average temperature based on Meteorological stations in [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]], Tual and Saumlaki are C 26.80, 27.70 C and 27.40 C. Minimum temperatures are 24.00, 24.70 C and 23.80 C, respectively, while the temperature Tual, the average humidity reaches 85.4% when recording Saumlaki Meteorological Station shows the average humidity is 80.2%.

The topography of the average condition of the Ambon region is rather flat, starting from the coast to residential areas. The mainland morphology of Ambon also varies from flat, bumpy, bumpy, hilly and mountainous with soft steep slopes to slightly dominant. The flat area has a slope of 0–3%, corrugated slope 3–8%, corrugated area 8–15%, hilly area 15–30% slope elevation and mountainous area greater than 30%. As for the [[Central Maluku Regency]], West Seram and East Seram, the topography is generally hilly. 0–2%, tilt / wavy 3–15% rather steep 15–40% and very steep 40%.

Topography in the [[Southeast Maluku Regency]] is divided into plains, hills and mountains with flat slopes (0–3%), flat / bumpy (3–8%), bumpy (8–15%), rather steep (15–30%) and very steep (> 50%). The height of the sea surface area is divided into three classes, namely in the low altitude area (000–100 m elevation), middle (100–500 m), and high altitude (> 500 m).

The topography of [[Buru Regency]] is mostly hilly and mountainous with a slope of 15–40% and 40%, the remaining height is from ordinary varieties. The highest mountain peak is located in the Kapalamada region north west of Buru with an altitude of 2736 meters above sea level (ASL), after Lake Rana with a height of more than 1000 meters above sea level, Lake Rana is estimated at around 700–750 meters above sea level. Using a landscape approach, Buru district is classified above, the coastal hills of the plains and mountains include varieties of highlands and slopes.

==Government and administrative divisions==
Following the splitting off of the northern parts of the regency in 1999 to form the new [[North Maluku]] Province (''Maluku Utara''), the residual province of Maluku was composed of two regencies ('''Central Maluku''' and '''Southeast Maluku''') and the '''City of Ambon''', but on 4 October 1999 two new regencies were created with the separation of '''Buru Regency''' from Central Maluku, and of '''Southeast Maluku West Regency''' from Southeast Maluku. Three additional regencies were created on 18 December 2003 (under Law 40/2003) - '''East Seram Regency''' and '''West Seram Regency''', both from parts of Central Maluku, and '''Aru Islands Regency''' from part of Southeast Maluku (which was thus left to comprise just the [[Kai Islands]]. On 17 July 2007 the '''City of Tual''' was separated from Southeast Maluku, and on 24 June 2008 two further regencies were created - '''South Buru Regency''' from part of Buru, and '''Southwest Maluku Regency''' from part of Southeast Maluku West. The residual part of Southeast Maluku West Regency was subsequently renamed the '''Tanimbar Islands Regency''' on 23 January 2019.

Thus the province of Maluku is currently divided into nine regencies (''kabupaten'') and the two cities (''kota'') of [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]] and [[Tual, Indonesia|Tual]], which form the tenth and eleventh regency-level administrative divisions. The regencies and cities, with their administrative capitals, are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and at the 2020 census,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> together with the official estimates for mid 2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Provinsi Maluku Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.81)</ref> The table also includes the numbers of districts (''kecamatan'') and villages (urban ''kelurahan'' and rural ''desa'') in each city or regency.

=== Ethnicity ===
Since ancient times, many of the Maluku people already had mixed blood with other ethnic groups, namely with Chinese, Indians, Persians, Europeans (generally the [[Netherlands]], [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]]), then the [[Arabs]] were very common considering this area had been controlled by foreign nations for 2,300 years and gave birth to new descendants, which is no longer a pure Melanesian race but still inherits and lives with the Melanesian-Alifuru style.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

Because of this mixture of culture and race with [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Indian people|Indians]], [[Persians]], [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] and [[Arabs]], Maluku is the only Indonesian territory that is classified as an area that has the largest [[multiracial]] population other than [[East Nusa Tenggara]]. Many Moluccans still retained foreign surnames from foreign countries such as the Netherlands (Van Afflen, Van Room, De Wanna, De Kock, Kniesmeijer, Gaspersz, Ramschie, Payer, Ziljstra, Van der Weden, etc.), Portugal (Da Costa, De Fretes, Que, Carliano, De Souza, De Carvalho, Pareira, Courbois, Frandescolli, etc.), Spain (Oliviera, Diaz, De Jesus, Silvera, Rodriguez, Montefalcon, Mendoza, De Lopez, etc.) and Arabic directly from [[Hadhramaut|Hadramaut]] (Al-Kaff, Al Chatib, Bachmid, Bakhwereez, Bahasoan, Al-Qadri, Alaydrus, Assegaff, etc.){{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

Today, the people of Maluku are not only found in Indonesia but are spread in various countries in the world. Most of those who migrate abroad are due to various reasons, of which the most classic was the large-scale movement of the Moluccans to Europe in the 1950s and settled there until now. Another reason is to get a better, more knowledgeable life, marrying and marrying other nations, who later settle down and have generations of new Moluccas in the other hemisphere. These Maluku expatriates can be found in quite large communities and are concentrated in several countries such as the Netherlands (which is considered the second homeland by the Moluccas other than the land of Maluku itself), [[Suriname]], Australia, and the United States. The Maluku community in other regions of Indonesia can be found in [[Medan]], [[Palembang]], [[Bandung]], [[Jabodetabek|Greater Jakarta]], [[Central Java]], [[Yogyakarta]], [[East Java]], [[Makassar]], [[Kupang]], [[Manado]], [[East Kalimantan]], [[Sorong]], and [[Jayapura]].{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

=== Language ===
The languages used in Maluku, especially in Ambon, has been influenced by foreign languages, often by explorers who have visited and even occupied and colonized Maluku in the past. The nations were the Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Dutch.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

The [[Ambonese language]], as the [[lingua franca]] in Maluku, has been understood by almost all residents of Maluku Province and generally, little by little, is understood by other East Indonesian people such as those in [[Ternate]], [[Manado]], [[Kupang]], etc. because [[Ambonese language|Ambonese]] is related to other languages in the provinces of [[North Sulawesi]], [[North Maluku]], [[East Nusa Tenggara]] and the six provinces of [[Western New Guinea|Indonesian Papua]].{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], as the official language and language of unity in the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia (NKRI), is used in official and formal public activities such as in government offices and in schools and in places such as museums, airports and ports.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

Maluku is the largest archipelago in all of Indonesia, although this area is 90% water and only 10% land. Maluku Province and [[North Maluku]] Province together compose the [[Maluku Islands]]. The large number of islands that are separated by long distances from each other also results in the increasingly diverse languages used in this province. Some of the most common languages spoken in Maluku - apart from Ambonese and Indonesian - are:

* [[Wemale language]], used by residents of Piru, Seruawan, Kamarian, and Rumberu in the [[West Seram Regency]].
* [[Alune language]] is used in three water streams, namely Tala, Mala and Malewa in the [[West Seram Regency]] area.
* [[Nuaulu language]], spoken by the Nuaulu tribe in the south of Seram Island, is between Elpaputih Bay and Teluk Telutih.
* [[Bobot language|Atiahu language]], used by three ethnic groups, which also included the Nuaulu family, namely Atiahu, Werinama, and Batuasa in the [[East Seram Regency]].
* [[Seti language (Indonesia)|Seti language]] is spoken by the Seti people, in North Seram and East Teluti, and also as a trade language in Eastern Seram.
* [[Tarangan language]], spoken in the Aru Island region.

==Culture==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2021}}

=== Music ===
The famous musical instruments are Tifa (a type of drum) and [[Kulintang|Totobuang]], played together in an ensemble called a [[Tifa totobuang]]. Each musical instrument from Tifa to Totobuang has different functions and supports each other to give birth to a very distinctive color of music. But this music is dominated by Tifa musical instruments. It consists of Tifa, Tifa Jekir, Tifa Dasar, Tifa Potong, Tifa Jekir Potong and Tifa Bas, plus a large Gong and Toto Buang which is a series of small gongs placed on a table with several holes as a buffer. There is also a wind instrument namely Bia Skin (Shellfish).

In the culture of Maluku, there are also stringed instruments namely [[Ukulele]] and that can also be found in the [[Hawaiian culture]] in the United States. This can be seen when Maluku music from the past until now still has a characteristic in which there is the use of Hawaiian musical instruments both in pop songs and in accompanying traditional dances such as Katreji.

Other musical instruments is the Sawat. Sawat is a blend of Maluku culture and Middle Eastern culture. In a few centuries ago, the Arabs came to spread Islam in Maluku, then there was a mixture of cultures including music. It is evident in several Sawat musical instruments, such as [[Tambourine]]s and [[Flute]]s that characterize Arabian music instruments.

Outside of the variety of musical instruments, Moluccan people are famous for being good at singing. Since long ago they have often sung in accompanying traditional dances. There are many famous Moluccan singers in both Indonesia and the Netherlands, such as [[Broery]] Pesulima, [[Daniël Sahuleka|Daniel Sahuleka]], [[Ruth Sahanaya]], [[Eric Papilaya]], [[Glenn Fredly|Glen Fredly]], etc. 

=== Dance ===
[[File:Cakalele.jpg|thumb|[[Cakalele]], a traditional Moluccan dance]]
The famous dance from the Moluccas is the [[Cakalele]] which describes the might of the Moluccas. This dance is usually performed by adult men while holding [[Parang]] and [[Salawaku]] (Shield).

There are also other dances like Saureka-Reka that use the sago palm fronds. The dances performed by six women really need accuracy and speed while accompanied by a very interesting musical rhythm.

The dance which is a depiction of youth association is Katreji. Katreji dance is played in pairs between women and men with varied energetic and interesting movements. This dance is almost the same as European dances in general because Katreji is also an acculturation of European (Portuguese and Dutch) culture with Maluku culture. This is more evident in every signal in changing floor patterns and movements which still use Portuguese and Dutch as a process of bilingualism. This dance is accompanied by a violin instrument, [[Bamboo musical instruments|bamboo flute]], [[ukulele]], karakas, guitar, tifa, and bass guitar with a more prominent western (European) musical pattern. This dance is still performed by the people of Maluku until now.

In addition to Katreji, the famous European influence is Polonaise, which is usually carried out by Moluccans at the time of marriage by each party member in pairs, forming a circle formation and carrying out light movements that can be followed by everyone, both young and old.

In addition, there is also a Crazy Bamboo Dance. Crazy bamboo dance is a special dance that is magical, originating from Suli Village. The uniqueness of this dance is that the dancers are burdened by bamboo which can move uncontrollably and this dance can be followed by anyone.
