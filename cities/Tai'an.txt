==History==
===Etymology===
Tai'an is named after Mount Tai. In Chinese, Tai ({{linktext|lang=zh|泰}}) means "significant". Thus, the name '''Tai'an''' is derived from the ancient saying: "If Mount '''Tai''' is safe, then the four seas (the world) are safe ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|安}} |p=ān}})."

===Early history===
Tai'an was home to the [[Dawenkou culture]] during the [[neolithic]] era. During the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and the [[Warring States period]], the region belonged to the states of [[State of Qi|Qi]] and [[State of Lu|Lu]]. The site of major historical and cultural significance in the area is [[Mount Tai]]. It attracted multiple emperors throughout the dynasties to [[Feng Shan|visit]], offer sacrifice to the heaven gods and pray for harvest. Confucius, Sima Qian, [[Cao Zhi]], Li Bai, [[Du Fu]] and other litterateurs visited here and many great works were produced.

===Modern history===
In 1909, German colonials built Tai'an-Fu Railway Station along with the construction of [[Tianjin–Pukou railway]] (Tientsin–Pukow railway). On 10 November of the following year, the first train service passed through the station.<ref>Daily Consular and Trade Reports, Issues 152-228, Department of Commerce and Labor, Bureau of Manufactures, 1913</ref>

On 1 May 1928, [[Chiang Kai-shek]], the leader of [[KMT]] and nationalist revolutionary army, commanded the attack of Tai'an and occupied it the next day.<ref>[https://wx.abbao.cn/a/725-f2fa94a79bc7338b.html Abbao] {{dead link|date=February 2023|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In October 1937, exiled students from Peking, Tianjin and other major cities arrived in Tai'an seeking asylum after the north of Yellow river was occupied by the Japanese forces. 
On 24 December 1937, Japanese troops crossed the Yellow River, occupied Jinan on the next day, and bombed Tai'an. On the night of 31 December, the Japanese occupied Tai'an.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://shandong-chorography.org/database/c91/section/5/article/31/ | title=第二节 徂徕山起义，四支队的建立与发展 - 泰安县地方史（1925—1949） - 泰山区地情库 - 泰安 - Shandong Chorography Archive }}</ref> Local resistants were assembled autonomously to fight against the occupation.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://shandong-chorography.org/database/c91/section/5/article/35/ | title=第一节 山东沦陷后泰安的抗战形势 - 泰安县地方史（1925—1949） - 泰山区地情库 - 泰安 - Shandong Chorography Archive }}</ref>

== Culture ==
Long ago, successive emperors would come to Tai'an to hold a Zen ceremony, and now the feudal society is over, but every year Tai'an will hold a large-scale live performance: "Chinese Taishan·Fengshan Grand Ceremony".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Liu |first=Yi |last2=Geng |first2=Xin |last3=Guan |first3=Rui |date=2023-10-01 |title=Development of Experiential Live-action Performance Products in Tai'an City: A Case Study of"Chinese Taishan·Fengshan Grand Ceremony". {{!}} Journal of Landscape Research {{!}} EBSCOhost |url=https://openurl.ebsco.com/contentitem/doi:10.16785%2Fj.issn1943-989x.2023.5.017?sid=ebsco:plink:crawler&id=ebsco:doi:10.16785%2Fj.issn1943-989x.2023.5.017 |access-date=2024-03-31 |website=openurl.ebsco.com |language=en}}</ref> Tai'an is a tourist city, and the Tai'an government has also been trying to promote the development of tourism in Tai'an.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Weidong |first=<p>Shi |last2=Xia |first2=Liu |last3=Ruyue</p> |first3=Wang |date=2023-11-20 |title=Research on tourism industry development strategy of Tai'an City in post-epidemic era |url=http://francis-press.com/papers/13408#abstract |journal=Academic Journal of Humanities & Social Sciences |language=en |volume=6 |issue=22 |doi=10.25236/AJHSS.2023.062219|doi-access=free }}</ref>
