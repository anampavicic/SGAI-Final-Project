Sibu is characterised by its diverse population, with a significant portion being of Chinese descent, primarily from the [[Fuzhou]] region. While other ethnic groups such as [[Iban people|Iban]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]], and [[Melanau people|Melanau]] are also present, they are not as prominent in Sibu as in other parts of Sarawak.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/population/05Jadual_Mukim_negeri/Mukim_Sarawak.pdf|title=Total population by ethnic group, sub-district and state, Malaysia, 2010 (page 376)|publisher=Department of Statistics, Malaysia|access-date=5 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205084527/http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/population/05Jadual_Mukim_negeri/Mukim_Sarawak.pdf|archive-date=5 February 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> As of 2010, the city had a population of 162,676 residents.<ref name=localauthoritypopulation>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/population/03ringkasan_kawasan_PBT_Jadual1.pdf |title=Population Distribution by Local Authority Areas and Mukims, 2010 (page 3) |publisher=Department of Statistics, Malaysia |access-date=5 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205090002/http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/population/03ringkasan_kawasan_PBT_Jadual1.pdf |archive-date=5 February 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>

The city's history dates back to its founding in 1862 by [[James Brooke]], who built a fort to protect against attacks by indigenous [[Dayak people]]. Subsequently, a small group of Chinese Hokkien settlers established themselves around the fort, engaging in various business activities. In 1901, [[Wong Nai Siong]] led a significant migration of 1,118 Fuzhou Chinese from [[Fujian province|Fujian]], China, to Sibu. Over time, infrastructure development took place, including the construction of the first hospital, Sibu bazaars, Methodist schools, and churches.

Sibu faced significant challenges in its history, enduring fires in 1889 and 1928 that destroyed the town. However, it was successfully rebuilt on both occasions. During the [[Second World War]], Sibu fell under Japanese occupation, resulting in a renaming of the city to "Sibu-shu" in August 1942. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, Sarawak became a British [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Crown Colony]]. This led to unrest among young [[Melanau people|Melanau]] individuals in Sibu who were in favour of independence, culminating in the assassination of [[Duncan Stewart (British diplomat)|Sir Duncan George Stewart]], the second British governor of Sarawak, during his visit to Sibu in December 1949. The perpetrator, [[Rosli Dhoby]], was subsequently executed in 1950.

In the post-war period, Sibu and the Rajang basin became a center of communist activities, which continued even after Sarawak gained independence in 1963. The establishment of the Rajang Security Command (RASCOM) aimed to curb communist activities in the area, and the communist insurgency in Sarawak was eventually suppressed in 1973, coming to a complete end in 1990.

Sibu achieved municipality status in 1981 and received a royal visit in September 2001. Additionally, it has served as a gateway to the [[Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy]] (SCORE) since 2008. The city celebrated the 110th anniversary of the Fuzhou settlement in 2011.

Sibu serves as a prominent hub for tourism in the Upper [[Rajang River]] region, renowned for its scenic riverine towns and traditional [[longhouse]]s inhabited by the Iban and [[Orang Ulu]] ethnic groups. Noteworthy landmarks within the city include [[Wisma Sanyan]], recognized as the tallest edifice in Sarawak,<ref name="RowthornCohen2008"/> and [[Lanang Bridge]], acclaimed as one of the lengthiest river bridges in the state.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wong upholds transformation of Sungai Bidut via dialogue|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2015/01/26/wong-upholds-transformation-of-sungai-bidut-via-dialogue/|access-date=7 February 2015|publisher=The Borneo Post|date=26 January 2015}}</ref> Sibu also features the largest town square in Malaysia, adjacent to Wisma Sanyan.<ref name="RowthornCohen2008">{{cite book|author1=Chris Rowthorn|author2=Muhammad Cohen|author3=China Williams|title=Borneo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vvXoC8F5Oq0C&pg=PA185|access-date=18 February 2011|date=1 June 2008|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74059-105-8|pages=185–}}</ref> Of historical significance is the [[Lau King Howe Hospital Memorial Museum]], distinguished as Malaysia's inaugural and sole medical-themed museum. Equally prominent is the Sibu Central Market, a sprawling indoor marketplace recognised as the largest of its kind in Sarawak. Tourist attractions in Sibu encompass the Sibu Heritage Centre, [[Tua Pek Kong Temple, Sibu|Tua Pek Kong Temple]], Bawang Assan longhouses, Sibu Old Mosque, [[Jade Dragon Temple]], Bukit Aup Jubilee Park, and Bukit Lima Forest Park. The city also hosts vibrant cultural events such as the [[Borneo Cultural Festival]] (BCF) and the Sibu International Dance Festival (SIDF). Economically, Sibu thrives on the [[Wood industry|timber]] and [[shipbuilding]] industries, which have historically been central to its economic landscape.

==Etymology==
Before 1873, Sibu was known as "Maling," a name derived from a bend in the Rajang River referred to as "Tanjung Maling." This bend was located opposite the present-day town of Sibu and near the confluence of the Igan and Rajang rivers.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chua|first1=Andy|title=BORNEO BEATS: Sibu's big fuss|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/story/?file=%2F2010%2F9%2F21%2Fsarawak%2F7065114|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708085420/http://www.thestar.com.my/story/?file=%2F2010%2F9%2F21%2Fsarawak%2F7065114|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 July 2015|access-date=8 July 2015|work=The Star (Malaysia)|date=21 September 2010|quote=According to historical facts, Sibu was known as Maling before June 1, 1873. It was named after the winding portion of a river in Tanjung Maling located at the other side of Rejang River. Maling was a small village with a few small and simple shophouses.}}</ref> The area was named after this prominent geographical feature.

On 1 June 1873, under the administration of the [[Kingdom of Sarawak|Brooke family]], the third division of Sarawak was established. This division later became known as the [[Sibu Division]]. The name "Sibu" itself was derived from the native [[Pulasan]] fruit, which was abundant in the region. In the [[Iban language]], this fruit is known as "Buah Sibau." Consequently, the division was named after the Pulasan fruit, reflecting the rich natural resources and cultural significance of the area.<ref name=thelex>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelex.com/sibu/history.html|title=Early history of Sibu|publisher= thelex.com|date=2006|access-date=6 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206164730/http://www.thelex.com/sibu/history.html|archive-date=6 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==History==

===Bruneian Empire===
In the 15th century, a historical event occurred{{clarify|date=October 2023}} in the region of southern Sarawak, which led to the displacement of immigrant [[Iban people|Iban communities]] towards what is now known as the Sibu region.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Rajang basin witnessed a series of tribal conflicts involving the Iban people and the indigenous populations residing in the same geographical area. These conflicts often resulted in skirmishes and confrontations.
At times the Iban groups would establish informal alliances with the Malay communities in the vicinity. These alliances were occasionally utilized for joint actions, such as launching attacks on the [[Kayan people (Borneo)|Kayan]] tribes inhabiting the region and conducting raids on passing Chinese and Indonesian vessels that traversed through this particular area.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ledesma|first1=Charles de|last2=Lewis|first2=Mark|last3=Savage|first3=Pauline|title=Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei|date=2003|publisher=Rough Guides|page=437|isbn=9781843530947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hS0_GehsGPwC&q=Sultan+of+Brunei+Sibu&pg=PA437}}</ref>

Wong obtained approval from [[Charles Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak|Charles Brooke]] to search for a new settlement in the Rajang basin. In April 1900, after a 13-day journey up the Rajang River, he decided to establish Sibu as the new settlement for his Fuzhounese clansmen, as the area near the Rajang delta was well-suited for agriculture.<ref name=thelex/> An agreement was formalized on 9 July 1900 between Wong Nai Siong and the Brooke government in Kuching, allowing Chinese settlers to inhabit the area.<ref name=thelex/><ref>{{cite book|author=Frank N.

On 21 January 1901, the first group of 72 settlers arrived in Sibu and settled in the Sungai Merah area, hailing from [[Fuzhou]], [[Fujian]], located about 6&nbsp;km from the town of Sibu. The second batch of 535 settlers arrived on 16 March 1901, marking what is now known as "New Fuzhou Resettlement Day."

Wong Nai Siong was appointed as the "Kang Choo" (港主, "port master") for the Fuzhounese settlement in Sibu. The settlers cultivated crops such as sweet potatoes, fruits, sugar cane, vegetables, and coarse grains in upland areas and rice in wetlands. Most of these settlers chose to remain in Sibu, considering it their new home.

[[File:1920 Sibu KMT meeting.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A 1920 [[Kuomintang]] meeting in Sibu]]
By 1919, the influence of the [[Chinese Civil War]] extended to Sarawak, with the [[Kuomintang]] establishing its initial branches in Sibu and Kuching. The then-reigning Rajah, Charles Brooke, opposed such political involvement by the local Chinese population and expelled several local Kuomintang leaders. However, his successor, [[Charles Vyner Brooke]], displayed a more receptive stance toward the activities of the local Chinese, who also engaged in fundraising to support the Kuomintang's resistance against Japanese invasion on the Chinese mainland.

Following the conclusion of [[World War II]], local Kuomintang leaders advocated for Sarawak's transfer to British control as a Crown Colony. This move encountered opposition from local communist leaders, leading to frequent clashes between the two factions. The Kuomintang branches in Sarawak were ultimately disbanded in 1949 when the party lost the Chinese Civil War to the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] and retreated to [[Taiwan]]. Nevertheless, tensions and conflicts between the two groups persisted until 1955, with the colonial British government banning the Kuomintang's newspaper in May 1951, and the communist newspaper ceasing publication in 1955 due to financial difficulties.<ref>{{cite news|title=中国政情牵动东南亚侨界 - 砂华社两派斗争 (The China political situation has affected the Chinese in South East Asia - The clashes between the two factions of Sarawak Chinese|url=http://www.intimes.com.my/write-html/06bau32.htm|access-date=9 February 2015|publisher=国际时报 [International Times (Sarawak)]|date=20 August 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209124444/http://www.intimes.com.my/write-html/06bau32.htm|archive-date=9 February 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Japanese occupation===
{{main|Japanese occupation of British Borneo}}
[[File:1942 Japanese generals in Sibu2.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A photo was taken with Japanese generals and the new Resident of Third Division after Sibu was renamed to "Sibu-shu".]]
During [[World War II]], Japanese forces initiated their invasion of the region by landing in [[Miri, Malaysia|Miri]] on 16 December 1941. Subsequently, they conquered Kuching on 24 December. On 25 December, Sibu experienced an air raid by nine Japanese warplanes that had flown from Kuching. Concerned about the impending invasion of Sibu, Andrew MacPherson, the Resident of the Third Division, made the decision to evacuate with his officers to the upstream area of the Rajang River. Their plan was to traverse through Batang Ai and navigate through the dense forests to reach [[Dutch Borneo]]. Unfortunately, they were apprehended and killed by Japanese forces at Ulu Moyan in Sarawak.<ref name=Sibufell>{{cite news|title=沦陷岁月 (The years that Sarawak fell to Japanese, part 2)|url=http://www.intimes.com.my/write-html/06bau22.htm|access-date=9 February 2015|publisher=国际时报 [International Times (Sarawak)]|date=6 June 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209124615/http://www.intimes.com.my/write-html/06bau22.htm|archive-date=9 February 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

On the evening of 26 December 1941, chaos erupted in Sibu as local residents began looting an unguarded government rice storeroom. This unrest extended beyond mere looting, with villagers residing along the Rajang River also partaking in thefts of daily necessities. The situation rapidly spiraled out of control, resulting in significant damage to the British [[Sime Darby]] company, [[Borneo Company Limited]], and Chinese businessmen who became victims of these riots. In an attempt to restore order, Chinese businessmen in the region banded together to form a security alliance.

To address the growing disorder, an advance team from Japan arrived in Sibu on 29 January 1942, after being summoned from Kuching. However, this team eventually fled Sibu and returned to Kuching. Consequently, a power vacuum persisted in the third division until 23 June 1942, when the Japanese headquarters in Kuching appointed Senda Nijiro as the new Resident of the Third Division of Sarawak. Upon assuming office, Senda Nijiro declared that the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] would assume complete control over people's lives and property in the region. On 8 August 1942, Sibu was officially renamed "Sibu-shu."<ref name=Sibufell/>

The Japanese authorities began to impose heavy taxes on the Chinese population and initiated a [[Sook Ching]] operation to identify suspected anti-Japanese individuals. Some Chinese individuals, under extreme torture, provided false lists of names of supposed anti-Japanese groups. Tragically, these lists led to the wrongful execution of innocent individuals at the Bukit Lima execution ground, while others were incarcerated in a prison in Kapit.<ref>{{cite news|title=沦陷岁月 (The years that Sarawak fell to Japanese, part 4)|url=http://www.intimes.com.my/write-html/06bau24.htm|access-date=9 February 2015|publisher=国际时报 [International Times (Sarawak)]|date=6 June 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209141653/http://www.intimes.com.my/write-html/06bau24.htm|archive-date=9 February 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===British Crown Colony===

[[File:Rosli Dhoby.jpg|right|thumb|140px|Rosli Dhobi]]
Following the end of the Japanese occupation of Sarawak in 1945, [[Charles Vyner Brooke]], the last Rajah of Sarawak, made the decision to cede the state to become part of the British [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|crown colony of Sarawak]]. This proposal faced significant opposition from the local population, leading to the emergence of the [[anti-cession movement of Sarawak|anti-cession movement in Sarawak]].

One prominent figure in the anti-cession movement was [[Rosli Dhobi]], a Sarawak nationalist hailing from Sibu and a member of the Malay Youth Movement (Gerakan Pemuda Melayu). The primary objective of this movement was to secure Sarawak's independence from British colonial rule.

At the young age of 17, Rosli carried out the assassination of [[Duncan Stewart (British diplomat)|Sir Duncan George Stewart]], the second governor of colonial Sarawak, on December 3, 1949. This act was a reflection of his strong commitment to the anti-cession cause.

Rosli, along with three of his accomplices, namely Awang Ramli Amit, Bujang Suntong, and Morshidi Sidek, were subsequently tried and sentenced to death by hanging. On March 2, 1950, they were buried at the Kuching Central Prison.<ref name=discoversibu/>

In recognition of their role in the anti-colonial movement against the British, Rosli Dhobi and his associates were later given a full state funeral by the Sarawak state government.<ref>{{YouTube|gCaDHtf7Em8|Rosli Dhoby - Pejuang Atau Pembunuh 4/5 (Rosli Dhoby - A patriotic fighter or a murderer?

===Communist insurgency===
{{Main|Sarawak Communist Insurgency}}
In the early 1950s, influenced by the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, communist members in Sibu began to establish a presence in Sarawak. Huang Sheng Zi from [[Bintangor, Sarawak|Bintangor]] became the president of the Borneo Communist Party (BCP), and BCP activities were concentrated in areas such as Sibu, [[Sarikei]], and Bintangor. Huang Zeng Ting, another communist and Huang Sheng Zi's brother, played a significant role in the formation of Sarawak's first political party, the [[Sarawak United Peoples' Party]] (SUPP), becoming its first executive secretary.<ref>{{cite news|title=砂劳越解放同盟（上） (Sarawak Liberation League (part 1)|url=http://intimes.com.my/write-html/06bau40.htm|access-date=11 February 2015|publisher=国际时报 [International Times (Sarawak)]|date=8 August 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317132115/http://www.intimes.com.my/write-html/06bau40.htm|archive-date=17 March 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1954, the Sarawak Liberation League (SLL) was formed following the consolidation of the BCP with several other communist organisations.<ref>{{cite news|title=砂劳越解放同盟（下） (Sarawak Liberation League (part 2)|url=http://intimes.com.my/write-html/06bau41.htm|access-date=11 February 2015|publisher=国际时报 [International Times (Sarawak)]|date=29 August 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317085414/http://www.intimes.com.my/write-html/06bau41.htm|archive-date=17 March 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The spread of communism in Sibu was facilitated by student movements in schools like Chung Hua Secondary School, Catholic High School, and Wong Nai Siong High School. Communist strongholds in Sibu were notably located at Oya Road and Queensway (now Jalan Tun Abang Haji Openg). The movement also received support from the [[intelligentsia]] and workers in Sibu. Dr. Wong Soon Kai, for example, supported the movement by providing free medication.<ref name=NorthKalimantan/> Villagers in Kampung Tanjung Kunyit were among those pressured to supply food and medical provisions to the communists.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wong|first1=Dennis|title=Communists harassed villagers for food|url=http://www2.nst.com.my/nation/communists-harassed-villagers-for-food-1.586435|access-date=10 March 2015|publisher=New Straits Times|date=4 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310133328/http://www2.nst.com.my/nation/communists-harassed-villagers-for-food-1.586435|archive-date=10 March 2015}}</ref>

In March 1971, the communists initiated an anti-pornography campaign, and in early 1973, they launched another campaign opposing tax increases and price inflation while advocating for higher wages for workers. Communist volunteers distributed pamphlets at various locations, including shophouses, schools, and the wharf terminal.

On 25 March 1973, the Sarawak government, led by Chief Minister [[Abdul Rahman Ya'kub]], began cracking down on communist activities in the Rajang basin by establishing the "Rajang Special Security Area."

In the early days, Fuzhounese settlers in Sibu tried to convert the town into a rice cultivation centre. However, this vision did not materialise because the soil was not suitable for rice cultivation. In August 1909, Charles Brooke agreed to grant land titles to Sibu Chinese farmers and encouraged them to cultivate rubber plantations. The rise of rubber prices from 1909 to 1911 had encouraged another 2,000 Fuzhounese settlers to come to Sibu. The demand for rubber rose again during [[Korean War]] between 1950 and 1953 and has benefited Sibu rubber plantations. Local farmers later used the profits from rubber plantations into setting up shops at Sungai Merah and Durin bazaars and involve in more profitable timber industry. During the [[Sarawak Communist Insurgency]] in the 1970s, rural farmers had to abandon their rubber plantations because of martial law declared by the state government which forbade them for helping the communists operating in the jungles.<ref name=Yutsuen/>

The timber industry in Sibu flourished during the 1940s and 1950s<ref name=1998Sibu/> and its economic importance surpassed rubber plantations in the 1960s.<ref name=Yutsuen/> Several global timber conglomerates such as the [[Rimbunan Hijau Group]], Ta Ann Holdings Berhad, Sanyan Group, WTK, The Sarawak Company, and Asia Plywood Company set up their headquarters in Sibu.

Sibu is well-known for its wide variety of ethnic dishes, especially indigenous food from the Dayaks community and also food inspired from Fuzhou community. The "Bandong walk" project was started in 2012 and was scheduled to be completed in 2015.

* '''Kampua''' noodle (also known as 干盘面 'dry plate noodles') — a dish introduced by early Chinese migrants from Foochow city (Fuzhou) who settled in Sibu, is a simple and filling noodle dish. It consists of homemade noodles mixed with locally available ingredients like pork lard, shallots, and seasonings. The noodles, made from wheat flour, eggs, salt, and water, are boiled, strained, and then tossed with fragrant pork lard, sauces, and seasonings. Slices of pork are added for flavour, and today, Kampua comes in various versions, including plain, dark, and red, with different sauces for distinct flavour profiles.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-02-12 |title=Foochow Kampua: A Simple yet Iconic Noodle Dish from Sibu Sarawak |url=https://ikanmas.in/malaysian-food/kampua-sibu/ |access-date=2023-08-29 |language=en-US}}</ref> It is available at almost all coffee shops and food stalls.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chua|first1=Andy|title='Flying Kampua Mee' in Sibu gets them coming back for seconds|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Community/2013/11/01/Flying-Kampua-Mee-in-Sibu-gets-them-coming-back-for-seconds/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313150708/http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Community/2013/11/01/Flying-Kampua-Mee-in-Sibu-gets-them-coming-back-for-seconds/|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 March 2015|access-date=13 March 2015|work=The Star (Malaysia)|date=1 November 2013}}</ref> Halal kampua noodles are available too.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mi Kampua di Pasar Besar Sibu (Kampua Mee at Sibu Central Market)|url=http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/Pelancongan/20140301/pl_04/Mi-Kampua-di-Pasar-Besar-Sibu|access-date=13 March 2015|work=Utusan Malaysia|date=1 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313151124/http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/Pelancongan/20140301/pl_04/Mi-Kampua-di-Pasar-Besar-Sibu|archive-date=13 March 2015|language=ms}}</ref>
* '''Dian Mian Hu''' (also known as Duëng Mian Ngu or Ding Bian Hu 鼎边糊) — a unique noodle soup from Sibu, has roots in the migration of Fuzhou settlers. Its name translates to "wok edge paste" in Chinese, alluding to its distinctive preparation method. The star of the dish is the flat noodles made from a rice flour batter. This batter is poured along the edge of a hot wok, forming thin dough upon contact. Skilled hands scrape this into the soup, creating the distinct noodles. The soup is a masterpiece, usually featuring a blend of pork and cuttlefish stock, enhanced with local ingredients like Sarawakian white pepper. Diners can add extra flavor with a dash of this aromatic pepper. Some variations even offer a curry-based soup, showcasing local influence. Dian Mian Hu is a sought-after delicacy, primarily enjoyed in eateries due to its specialized preparation techniques.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-05-12 |title=Ding Bian Hu: The Characteristic Wok Edge Paste Noodles from Sibu Sarawak |url=https://ikanmas.in/malaysian-food/ding-bian-hu-sibu/ |access-date=2023-08-29 |language=en-US}}</ref> It is available at several stalls as a hefty breakfast or a late night supper.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sibu's Famous Diang Miang Ngu|url=http://www.alexallied.com/reviews/food/sibu-famous-diang-miang-ngu|website=alexallied.com|access-date=13 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220083833/http://www.alexallied.com/reviews/food/sibu-famous-diang-miang-ngu|archive-date=20 February 2015|date=14 April 2009}}</ref>
* '''Kompia''' (also known as Guang Bing, [[Kompyang]] or Gom bian 光饼) —  often referred to as "Foochow [[Bagel|bagels]]," is a delightful bread akin to bagels with its origins in Fuzhou, China. It made its way to Malaysian towns with a thriving Fuzhou Chinese community, becoming a culinary gem. Legend has it that Kompia was invented by Qi Jiguang, who designed it with a hole in the center for easy portability during military campaigns. The dough is prepared from wheat flour, baking soda, yeast, salt, and water, then shaped into balls with a hole in the center. Traditionally baked in clay ovens, modern versions use conventional ovens. Kompia can be enjoyed plain or with sesame seeds, and regional variations abound. In Sibu, it's often served with stewed pork mince, but creative adaptations include Kompia with donut icing, rojak sauce, and even as a cheeseburger, showcasing its versatility.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-09-16 |title=Kompia: Iconic Bagels Found in Foochow Towns of Malaysia |url=https://ikanmas.in/malaysian-food/kompia/ |access-date=2023-08-29 |language=en-US}}</ref> Traditional soft kompia dipped in pork mince sauce can be sought from Chung Hua road, the Sunday Market at Pedada road, and Sibu Central Market.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tiong Hua Road Sibu's Famous Kompia|url=http://www.wanderlustglutton.com/2014/07/tiong-hua-road-sibus-famous-kompia.html|publisher=Wanderlust Glutton|access-date=13 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313153201/http://www.wanderlustglutton.com/2014/07/tiong-hua-road-sibus-famous-kompia.html|archive-date=13 March 2015}}</ref> There are deep fried variations available throughout the town of Sibu.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kompia (Foochow Bagels) at Seng Kee Agency, Sibu|url=http://silverdolly.blogspot.com/2011/07/kompia-foochow-bagels-at-seng-kee.html|access-date=13 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703122148/http://silverdolly.blogspot.com/2011/07/kompia-foochow-bagels-at-seng-kee.html|archive-date=3 July 2014|date=14 July 2011}}</ref>
* '''Bian Nyuk''' (also known as 扁肉) — meaning 'flattened meat' in the Foochow dialect, is a cherished dish in Sibu, celebrated for its rich Foochow culinary heritage. This delightful [[wonton]]-type dish features a thin and translucent skin called yanpi, which is meticulously crafted without the use of alkaline water, giving it a unique ability to melt in your mouth. Unlike traditional wontons, Bian Nyuk boasts thinner skin and a lighter, less greasy texture. It is typically filled with lean and finely minced pork, resulting in a delicate texture and exquisite taste. Often enjoyed alongside another Sibu breakfast staple, Kampua noodles, Bian Nyuk comes in both soup and dry-tossed variations. Served in various flavours, including the classic white and savoury black with dark soy sauce.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-08-10 |title=Bian Nyuk: The Delicate Foochow Wontons of Sibu |url=https://ikanmas.in/malaysian-food/bian-nyuk-sibu/ |access-date=2023-09-02 |language=en-US}}</ref>
* '''Bazhen Soup''' (also known as 八珍汤/八珍药 or Bek Ding Yuok or Eight Rarity Soup) — one of the well-known herbal soups in Sibu. Many people love to drink it since young. It is made up of two recipes of soup, Sijunzi Soup (Four Gentlemen Soup) and Siwu Soup (Four Substance Soup). The Codonopsis, Atractylodes, Poria and Licorice in the recipe are the ingredients from Sijunzi Soup. While the Shudi, Baishao, Angelica and Chuanxiong are the ingredients from Siwu Soup. These eight types of Chinese herbs add up to become Bazhen Tang, which traditionally help to nourish qi and blood, strengthen the spleen and stomach, and relieve fatigue. Bazhen Soup should be evenly proportioned with sufficient ingredients to make the taste authentic. When paired with Fuzhou longevity noodles, it turns into a delicious dish. Bazhen soup packed could be purchased easily from traditional Chinese herbal shops in Sibu town like Poh Guan Hong and Chew Hock Choon. <ref>{{Cite web |title=Featured Products - Bazhen Soup |url=https://www.pohguanhong.com.my/featuredproducts/ |access-date=2023-08-29 |website=Poh Guan Hong 保元行 |language=en-US}}</ref>

This paste, comprising various aromatic ingredients, is sautéed to perfection before being combined with chicken and prawn broth and coconut milk. The broth is seasoned with soy sauce, vinegar, or fish sauce for a balanced flavor. Typically served with thin rice vermicelli noodles and a variety of garnishes including spring onions, prawns, chicken, and egg omelette, Sarawak Laksa is enhanced with a side of shrimp paste and chilli sambal belacan. A halved kalamansi lime is also provided to brighten the dish with a citrusy touch.

* '''Tebaloi''' (also known as Tabaloi) — is a traditional [[Melanau people|Melanau]] snack closely linked to the Sarawak region, particularly the Mukah and Dalat districts. It's made from sago flour, desiccated coconut, eggs, and sugar, which are mixed to create a dough. This dough is then flattened on a banana leaf and cooked over a wood fire stove, giving it a unique smoky flavor. Once cooked, the dough is cut into squares, flattened further, and dried to achieve its signature crispiness. Tebaloi comes in various flavors today but maintains its historic ties to the Melanau people's culture and traditions. You can find it in Sibu Central Market and enjoy its delightful textures and tastes during tea time. <ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-06-21 |title=Tebaloi: The Delicious Sago Snack of the Melanau People |url=https://ikanmas.in/malaysian-food/tebaloi-sarawak/ |access-date=2023-08-29 |language=en-US}}</ref>
* '''Kek Lapis Sarawak''' — is a popular layered cake in Sarawak, known for its vibrant colors and intricate designs.

These layers are carefully assembled and bound with condensed milk or jam. The cake's cross-section reveals its kaleidoscopic beauty, showcasing the skill and attention to detail in its creation.

* '''Manok Pansoh''' (also known as Manuk Pansuhi) — a cherished dish among the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] community in Sarawak, involves cooking marinated chicken inside a bamboo stalk, infusing it with a unique flavor. The chicken is prepared with a mix of aromatic ingredients, including ginger, lemongrass, and more. This marinated chicken is then stuffed into bamboo, sealed with tapioca leaves, and roasted over an open fire, creating a delightful and aromatic dish. Manok Pansoh's exact origin remains a mystery, but its ingenuity and simplicity make it a beloved tradition, initially served during the Gawai Dayak festival but now enjoyed widely at various occasions. <ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-12-03 |title=Manok Pansoh: An Ethnic Bamboo Chicken Dish from Sarawak |url=https://ikanmas.in/malaysian-food/ayam-pansuh-manok-pansoh/ |access-date=2023-08-29 |language=en-US}}</ref>
* '''Terung Asam''' (also known as Terung Dayak) — is a unique and sour-tasting fruit cherished by Sarawak's Dayak community. Unlike regular aubergines, it has a round shape, dark green skin turning yellow when ripe, and firm, bright yellow flesh with small seeds in the center. Terung Asam is not only distinct in appearance but also offers impressive nutrition, including vitamin C, calcium, fiber, phosphorus, and potassium. It's commonly used in Sarawak-style sour and spicy soups, where it's combined with lemongrass, chili, ginger, and various proteins like fish, poultry, or meat. Grilling Terung Asam and making it into a spicy sambal is another popular approach. Some even use it to create unique Terung Asam-flavored ice cream.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-02-26 |title=Terung Asam: The Flavoursome Sour Eggplant of Sarawak |url=https://ikanmas.in/malaysian-food/terung-asam-sarawak/ |access-date=2023-09-02 |language=en-US}}</ref>
* '''Empurau —''' known as the "King of the River," is Malaysia's priciest fish, inhabiting clear, swift rivers with a unique taste influenced by its diet of native fruits. Its slow growth contributes to its high cost, with larger specimens fetching prices up to RM2000 per kg. Typically steamed or eaten raw, it offers a delicate flavor and edible scales that chefs transform into crispy snacks. However, wild Empurau populations are dwindling due to overfishing and habitat loss, prompting conservation efforts.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-03-08 |title=Empurau: The Most Expensive and Unforgettable Fish in Malaysia |url=https://ikanmas.in/malaysian-food/empurau/ |access-date=2023-09-02 |language=en-US}}</ref>
