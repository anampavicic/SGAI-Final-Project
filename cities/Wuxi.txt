'''Wuxi''' ({{zh|s=无锡}}, {{respell|WOO|shee}}) is a city in southern [[Jiangsu]], China. As of the [[2020 Chinese census|2020 census]], the city had a total population of 7,462,135 inhabitants. The city lies in the southern delta of the [[Yangtze]] and on [[Lake Tai]]. The city's landmarks include [[Lihu Park]], the Mt. Lingshan Grand Buddha Scenic Area and its {{convert|88|m|adj=on|sp=us}}-tall [[Grand Buddha at Ling Shan]] statue, [[Xihui Park]], Wuxi Zoo, and the [[Wuxi Museum]]. The transportation to the city include [[Sunan Shuofang International Airport]], [[Wuxi Metro]], and [[Shanghai–Nanjing Intercity High-Speed Railway]], and [[Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway]]. Wuxi is the home to [[Jiangnan University]].

==Etymology==
Despite varied origin stories based on the second Chinese character 锡 of the city's name meaning "tin", many modern Chinese scholars favor the view that the word is derived from the "[[old Yue language]]" or, supposedly, the old [[Kra–Dai languages]], rather than reflecting the presence of tin in the area.<ref>{{Cite book |script-title=zh:方言与中国文化|last=Zhou, You|first=Zhenhe, Rujia|publisher=Shanghai People's Publishing House|year=1986|isbn=978-7-208-00965-3|pages=153–4}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite book|publisher=[[Shanghai Lexicographical Publishing House]] |year=1996|isbn=7-5326-0299-0|page=105|language=zh|script-title=zh:中国历史大辞典·历史地理卷|trans-title=The Great Encyclopaedia of Chinese History, Volume on Historical Geography}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |script-title=zh:郑张尚芳语言学论文集|last=Zhengzhang|first=Shangfang|publisher=Zhonghua Book Company|year=2012|isbn=978-7-101-06105-5|trans-title=Zhengzhang Shangfang's Symposium on Linguistics |script-chapter=zh:古吴越地名中的侗台语成分, 古越语地名人名解义}}</ref>

==History==
Clues are to be found at the Meili Museum and the Helv Relics Museum, Wuxi is the ancient capital of Wu State during the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BCE).<ref>{{cite web |title=Modernity, Chinese Style, and the Wuxi Gene| url=http://en.wuxi.gov.cn/2022-12/08/c_837689.htm|publisher=TIME Magazine|access-date=16 June 2023}}</ref> [[Taibo]] and Zhongyong traveled southeast and settled in Wuxi Meili. There, Taibo and his followers set up the State of [[Wu (state)|Wu]], and made Wuxi as its founding capital which lasted for 600 years. The history of Wuxi can be traced back to [[Shang dynasty]] (1600–1046 BC).<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://en.wuxi.gov.cn/a/20130724/364111.shtml|title=History of Wuxi|publisher=Government of Wuxi|access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref>
The tin industry thrived in the area in ancient times but it was eventually depleted, so that when Wuxi was established in 202 BCE during the [[Han dynasty]], it was named "Wuxi" (the capital of WU state). Administratively, Wuxi became a district of Biling (later [[Changzhou]]) and only during the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1206–1368) did it become an independent prefecture.<ref name="EB">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Wuxi|title=Wuxi|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190902092607/https://www.britannica.com/place/Wuxi|archive-date=2 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Wuxi and Changzhou are considered to be the birthplaces of modern industrialization in China.<ref name="Shu">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wVC-BAAAQBAJ&q=History+Wuxi&pg=PA66|title=Entrepreneurship in Family Business: Cases from China|author=Shi, Henry X|publisher=Springer|year=2014|pages=65–6|isbn=978-3-319-04304-3}}</ref>

[[Agriculture]] and the silk industry flourished in Wuxi and the town became a transportation hub under the early Tang Dynasty after the opening of [[Grand Canal (China)|the Grand Canal]] in 609. It became known as one of the biggest markets for rice in China.<ref name="EB"/>

The [[Donglin Academy]], originally founded during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) was restored in Wuxi in 1604. Not a school, it served as a public forum, advocating a Confucian orthodoxy and ethics. Many of its academicians were retired court officials or officials deposed in the 1590s due to [[Political faction|factionalism]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gDqsCQAAQBAJ&q=Donglin+1604+Wuxi&pg=PA686|author=Jones, Derek|title=Censorship: A World Encyclopedia|publisher=Routledge|page=686|year=2001|isbn=978-1-136-79864-1}}</ref>

As a populous county, its eastern part was separated and made into Jinkui county in 1724.
