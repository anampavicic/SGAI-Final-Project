== History ==

=== Pre-colonial foundation as an independent colony ===
Before Europeans arrived, the New Haven area was the home of the [[Quinnipiac]] tribe of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who lived in villages around the harbor and sustained an economy of local fisheries and the farming of [[maize]]. The area was briefly visited by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] explorer [[Adriaen Block]] in 1614. Dutch traders set up a small trading system of [[beaver]] pelts with the local inhabitants, but trade was sporadic and the Dutch did not settle permanently in the area.

[[File:Atwater1881 p10 Map New Haven in 1641.jpg|thumb|left|The 1638 nine-square plan, with the extant [[New Haven Green]] at its center, continues to define New Haven's downtown.]]

In 1637, a small party of Puritans did a reconnaissance of the New Haven harbor area and wintered over. In April 1638, the main party of five hundred Puritans, who had left the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] under the leadership of Reverend [[John Davenport (Puritan)|John Davenport]] and London merchant [[Theophilus Eaton]], sailed into the harbor. It was their hope to set up a theological community with the government more closely linked to the church than that in Massachusetts, and to exploit the area's potential as a port. The Quinnipiacs, who were under attack by neighboring [[Pequot people|Pequots]], sold their land to the settlers in return for a pledge of protection.<ref>{{Cite web |title=New Haven's History {{!}} New Haven, CT |url=https://www.newhavenct.gov/government/about-new-haven/new-haven-s-history |access-date=July 5, 2023 |website=www.newhavenct.gov |language=en |archive-date=July 3, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230703045417/https://www.newhavenct.gov/government/about-new-haven/new-haven-s-history |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Theophilus Eaton house in New Haven.png|thumb|right|House of New Haven Founder [[Theophilus Eaton]] as it stood at Orange and Elm streets in the 17th century]]

By 1640, "Quinnipiac's" [[theocracy|theocratic]] government and nine-square grid plan were in place, and the [[New England town|town]] was renamed New Haven, with '[[wiktionary:haven#Etymology|haven]]' meaning harbor or port. However, the area to the north remained Quinnipiac until 1678, when it was renamed [[Hamden, Connecticut|Hamden]]. The settlement became the headquarters of the [[New Haven Colony]], distinct from the [[Connecticut Colony]] previously established to the north centering on [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]. Reflecting its theocratic roots, the New Haven Colony forbade the establishment of other churches, whereas the Connecticut Colony permitted them.

Economic disaster struck New Haven in 1646, when the town sent its first fully loaded ship of local goods (the "Great Shippe") back to England. It never reached its destination, and its disappearance hindered New Haven's development as compared to the rising trade powers of [[Boston]] and [[New Amsterdam]] (modern day [[New York City|New York]]).

In 1660, Colony founder John Davenport's wishes were fulfilled, and [[Hopkins School]] was founded in New Haven with money from the estate of [[Edward Hopkins]].

In 1661, the [[Regicide of Charles I of England|Regicides]] who had signed the death warrant of [[Charles I of England]] were pursued by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. Two of them, Colonel [[Edward Whalley]] and Colonel [[William Goffe]], fled to New Haven for refuge. Davenport arranged for them to hide in the [[West Rock]] hills northwest of the town. A third judge, [[John Dixwell]], later joined the others. None of the three were ever returned to England for trial; Dixwell died of old age in New Haven, the others likewise elsewhere in New England.

=== As part of the Connecticut Colony ===
[[File:New Haven 1786.jpeg|thumb|right|New Haven as it appeared in a 1786 engraving]]
[[File:Second meeting house, new haven, ct.png|thumb|right|upright|Second meeting house on the New Haven Green, as it stood from 1670 to 1757]]

In 1664, New Haven became part of the Connecticut Colony when the two colonies were merged under political pressure from England. Seeking to establish a new theocracy elsewhere, some members of the New Haven Colony went on to establish [[Newark, New Jersey]].

New Haven was made co-[[capital city|capital]] of Connecticut in 1701, a status it retained until 1873.

In 1716, the Collegiate School relocated from [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]] to New Haven, establishing it as a center of learning. In 1718, in response to a large donation from [[East India Company]] merchant [[Elihu Yale]], former Governor of [[Madras]], the Collegiate School was renamed [[Yale University|Yale College]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Schiff |first1=Judith |title=A Brief History of Yale |url=https://guides.library.yale.edu/yalehistory#:~:text=In%201718%2C%20when%20wealthy%20London,college%20was%20named%20Yale%20College. |website=Yale University Library |publisher=Yale University |access-date=August 8, 2021 |archive-date=August 8, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210808074347/https://guides.library.yale.edu/yalehistory#:~:text=In%201718%2C%20when%20wealthy%20London,college%20was%20named%20Yale%20College. |url-status=live }}</ref>

For over a century, New Haven citizens had fought in the colonial militia alongside regular British forces, including the [[French and Indian War]]. As the [[American Revolution]] approached, General [[David Wooster]] and other influential residents hoped that the conflict with the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British parliament]] could be resolved short of rebellion. On April 23, 1775, Captain [[Benedict Arnold]] commanded the Second Company, [[Governor's Foot Guard]], of New Haven to break into the powder house to arm themselves for a three-day march to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], an event still celebrated in New Haven as [[Powder House Day]]. Other New Haven militia members were on hand to escort [[George Washington]] from his overnight stay in New Haven on his way to Cambridge. Contemporary reports, from both sides, remark on the New Haven volunteers' professional military bearing, including uniforms.

On July 5, 1779, 2,600 loyalists and British regulars under General [[William Tryon]], governor of New York, landed in New Haven Harbor and [[Tryon's raid|raided]] the town of 3,500. A militia of Yale students had been preparing for battle, and former Yale president and [[Yale Divinity School]] professor [[Naphtali Daggett]] rode out to confront the Redcoats. Yale president Ezra Stiles recounted in his diary that while he moved furniture in anticipation of battle, he still couldn't quite believe the revolution had begun.<ref>Freeman, Joanne B., "The American Revolution," lecture 15, Open Yale course</ref> New Haven was not torched as the invaders did with [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] in 1777, or [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]] and [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] a week after the New Haven raid, preserving many of the town's colonial features.

=== Post-colonial period and industrialization ===

New Haven was incorporated as a city in 1784, and [[Roger Sherman]], one of the signers of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and author of the "[[Connecticut Compromise]]", became the new city's first mayor.

The city struck fortune in the late 18th century with the inventions and industrial activity of [[Eli Whitney]], a Yale graduate who remained in New Haven to develop the [[milling machine|cotton gin]] and establish a gun-manufacturing factory in the northern part of the city near the [[Hamden, Connecticut|Hamden]] town line. That area is still known as [[Whitneyville, Connecticut|Whitneyville]], and the main road through both towns is known as Whitney Avenue. The factory is now the [[Eli Whitney Museum]], which has a particular emphasis on activities for children and exhibits pertaining to the [[A. C. Gilbert Company]]. His factory, along with that of [[Simeon North]], and the lively clock-making and brass hardware sectors, contributed to making early Connecticut a powerful manufacturing economy; so many arms manufacturers sprang up that the state became known as "The Arsenal of America". It was in Whitney's gun-manufacturing plant that [[Samuel Colt]] invented the [[revolver|automatic revolver]] in 1836. Many other talented machinists and firearms designers would go on to found successful firearms manufacturing companies in New Haven, including [[Oliver Winchester]] and [[O.F. Mossberg & Sons]].

The [[Farmington Canal]], created in the early 19th century, was a short-lived transporter of goods into the interior regions of Connecticut and Massachusetts, and ran from New Haven to [[Northampton, Massachusetts]].

New Haven was to be the site of the first college for African Americans in the United States, but the plan was obstructed by efforts led by Yale [[Law School]] founder and former New Haven Mayor [[David Daggett]], who went on to serve as a U.S. Senator and judge on Connecticut's highest court. Daggett denigrated African Americans, denied they were citizens, and presided over the trial of a woman persecuted for trying to admit an African American girl to her boarding school and, having that effort blocked, running a boarding school for African American girls.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yaleslavery.org/WhoYaleHonors/daggett.html |title=David Daggett |publisher=Yaleslavery.org |date= |accessdate=February 11, 2022 |archive-date=March 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320072324/http://yaleslavery.org/WhoYaleHonors/daggett.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

New Haven was home to one of the important early events in the burgeoning [[Antislavery Movement In America|anti-slavery movement]] when, in 1839, the trial of mutineering [[Mende people|Mende tribesmen]] being transported as slaves on the Spanish [[slaveship]] ''[[La Amistad|Amistad]]'' was held in [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut|New Haven's United States District Court]].<ref name="WDL">{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/3080/ |title=Unidentified Young Man |website=[[World Digital Library]] |date=1839–1840 |access-date=July 28, 2013 |archive-date=September 27, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927124613/http://www.wdl.org/en/item/3080/ |url-status=live }}</ref> There is a [[Amistad memorial (New Haven)|statue]] of [[Joseph Cinqué]], the informal leader of the slaves, beside City Hall.

The [[American Civil War]] boosted the local economy with wartime purchases of industrial goods, including that of the [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company#Predecessors|New Haven Arms Company]], which would later become the [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company]]. (Winchester would continue to produce arms in New Haven until 2006, and many of the buildings that were a part of the Winchester plant are now a part of the [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company Historic District]]).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/19/AR2006011903278.html?nav=most_emailed |newspaper=The Washington Post |title=Out With A Bang |first=Stephen |last=Hunter |date=January 20, 2006 |access-date=May 20, 2010 |archive-date=October 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019175451/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/19/AR2006011903278.html?nav=most_emailed |url-status=live }}</ref> After the war, population grew and doubled by the start of the 20th century, most notably due to the influx of [[immigrants]] from southern Europe, particularly Italy.

Westville was the center of [[American Jews|Jewish]] life in New Haven, though today many have fanned out to suburban communities such as Woodbridge and Cheshire.

=== Post-industrial era and urban redevelopment ===

New Haven's expansion continued during the two World Wars, with most new inhabitants being [[African American]]s from the [[Southern United States|American South]], and [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Ricans]]. The city reached its peak population after [[World War II]]. The area of New Haven is only {{convert|17|sqmi|km2|0}}, encouraging further development of new housing after 1950 in adjacent, suburban towns. Moreover, as in other U.S. cities in the [[United States in the 1950s|1950s]], New Haven began to suffer [[white flight]] of [[middle-class]] workers. One author suggested that aggressive [[redlining]] and rezoning made it difficult for residents to obtain financing for older, deteriorating urban housing stock, thereby condemning such structures to deterioration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://politicalscience.yale.edu/publications/city-urbanism-and-its-end-institution-social-and-policy-st |title=City: Urbanism and Its End (The Institution for Social and Policy St) – Department of Political Science |website=politicalscience.yale.edu |access-date=October 2, 2017 |archive-date=May 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529102003/http://politicalscience.yale.edu/publications/city-urbanism-and-its-end-institution-social-and-policy-st |url-status=live }}</ref>{{Additional citation needed|date=October 2017|reason=Non-free source cited; additional source needed to support this assertion}}

In 1954; then-mayor [[Richard C. Lee]] began some of the earliest major [[urban renewal]] projects in the United States. Certain sections of [[downtown New Haven]] were redeveloped to include museums, new office towers, a hotel, and large shopping complexes.<ref name="time.com">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,825008,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019193231/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,825008,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 19, 2011 |magazine=Time |title=CITIES: Forward Look in Connecticut |date=June 24, 1957 |access-date=May 20, 2010}}</ref> Other parts of the city, particularly the Wooster Square and [[Fair Haven (New Haven)|Fair Haven]] neighborhoods were affected by the construction of [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|Interstate 95]] along the Long Wharf section, [[Interstate 91]], and the [[Oak Street Connector]]. The Oak Street Connector ([[Connecticut Route 34|Route 34]]), running between Interstate 95, downtown, and [[The Hill (New Haven)|The Hill]] neighborhood, was originally intended as a highway to the city's western suburbs but was only completed as a highway to the downtown area, with the area to the west becoming a boulevard (See "Redevelopment" below).

In 1970, a [[New Haven Black Panther trials|series of criminal prosecutions]] against various members of the [[Black Panther Party]] took place in New Haven, inciting mass protests on the New Haven Green involving twelve thousand demonstrators and many well-known [[New Left]] political activists. (See "Political Culture" below for more information).

From the 1960s through the late 1990s, central areas of New Haven continued to decline both economically and in terms of population despite attempts to resurrect certain neighborhoods through renewal projects. In conjunction with its declining population, New Haven experienced a steep rise in its [[crime rate]].

Since approximately 2000, many parts of downtown New Haven have been revitalized with new restaurants, nightlife, and small retail stores. In particular, the area surrounding the New Haven Green has experienced an influx of apartments and condominiums. In addition, two new supermarkets opened to serve downtown's growing residential population: a Stop & Shop opened just west of downtown, while Elm City Market, located one block from the Green, opened in 2011.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/29/realestate/commercial-property-connecticut-downtown-new-haven-s-multifaceted-rehabilitation.html?scp=1&sq=connecticut%20financial%20center%20new%20haven&st=cse |work=The New York Times |title=Commercial Property/Connecticut; Downtown New Haven's Multifaceted Rehabilitation |first=Eleanor |last=Charles |date=September 29, 2002 |access-date=February 11, 2017 |archive-date=July 1, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701025212/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/29/realestate/commercial-property-connecticut-downtown-new-haven-s-multifaceted-rehabilitation.html?scp=1&sq=connecticut%20financial%20center%20new%20haven&st=cse |url-status=live }}</ref> The recent turnaround of downtown New Haven has received positive press from various periodicals.<ref name="Charles">{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E5DD103FF930A35757C0A9639C8B63 |work=The New York Times |first=Eleanor |last=Charles |date=April 3, 2005 |access-date=May 20, 2010 |title=LIVING IN/Downtown New Haven; An Infusion of Energy in Yale's Backyard |archive-date=June 8, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608041915/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E5DD103FF930A35757C0A9639C8B63 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/0dbad50a-0621-11df-8c97-00144feabdc0.html |title=/ House & Home – Downtown on an upturn |publisher=Ft.com |date=January 22, 2010 |access-date=September 28, 2011 |archive-date=June 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608173734/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/0dbad50a-0621-11df-8c97-00144feabdc0.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/realestate/21wczo.html?pagewanted=print |work=The New York Times |title=On Renewing New Haven |first=Lisa |last=Prevost |date=January 21, 2007 |access-date=May 20, 2010 |archive-date=May 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512184323/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/realestate/21wczo.html?pagewanted=print |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:Quinnipiac River from Fair Haven.jpg|thumb|left|View of the [[Quinnipiac River]] from [[Fair Haven (New Haven)|Fair Haven]]]]According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|52.1|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|48.4|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|3.7|km2|order=flip}}, or 6.67%, is water.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov |title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): New Haven city, Connecticut |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=September 26, 2012 |archive-date=December 27, 1996 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961227012639/https://www.census.gov/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

New Haven's best-known geographic features are its large, shallow harbor, and two reddish basalt [[trap rock]] ridges which rise to the northeast and northwest of the city core. These trap rocks are known respectively as [[East Rock]] and [[West Rock]], and both serve as extensive parks. West Rock has been tunneled through to make way for the east–west passage of the [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]] (the only highway tunnel through a natural obstacle in Connecticut), and once served as the hideout of the "[[Regicide of Charles I of England|Regicides]]" (see: [[Regicides Trail]]). Most New Haveners refer to these men as "The Three Judges". East Rock features the prominent Soldiers and Sailors war monument on its peak as well as the "Great/Giant Steps" which run up the rock's cliffside.

The city is drained by three rivers; the [[West River (Connecticut)|West]], [[Mill River (Connecticut)|Mill]], and [[Quinnipiac River|Quinnipiac]], named in order from west to east. The West River discharges into [[West Haven, Connecticut|West Haven]] Harbor, while the Mill and Quinnipiac rivers discharge into New Haven Harbor. Both harbors are embayments of [[Long Island Sound]]. In addition, several smaller streams flow through the city's neighborhoods, including Wintergreen Brook, the Beaver Ponds Outlet, Wilmot Brook, Belden Brook, and Prospect Creek. Not all of these small streams have continuous flow year-round.

=== Climate ===
According to the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen classification]], New Haven experiences a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa''), bordering a hot-summer [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa''). The city has hot, humid summers and cool to cold winters. From May to late September, the weather is typically hot and humid, with average temperatures exceeding {{convert|80|°F}} on 70 days per year. In summer, the [[Bermuda High]] creates as southern flow of warm and humid air, with frequent (but brief) thundershowers. October to early December is normally mild to cool late in the season, while early spring (April) can be cool to warm. Winters are more variable, with cool to cold temperatures, mixed with warmer spells, with both rain and snow fall. 

While the weather patterns that affect New Haven result from a primarily offshore direction, thus reducing the marine influence of Long Island Sound, the location on Long Island Sound often influences the weather along the coastline compared to inland. During summer heat waves, temperatures may reach {{convert|95|°F}} or higher on occasion with heat-index values of over {{convert|100|°F}}. [[Tropical cyclones]] have struck New Haven in the past, including 1938 Hurricane ([[Long Island Express]]), [[Hurricane Carol]] in 1954, [[Hurricane Gloria]] in 1985.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hanrahan • • |first=Ryan |title=Hurricane Carol |url=https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/hurricane-carol/21493/ |access-date=November 9, 2022 |website=NBC Connecticut |date=August 31, 2017 |language=en-US |archive-date=November 9, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221109124713/https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/hurricane-carol/21493/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=September 26, 2015 |title=Hurricane Gloria hit Connecticut 30 years ago causing $60 million in damage |url=https://www.nhregister.com/weather/article/Hurricane-Gloria-hit-Connecticut-30-years-ago-11342161.php |access-date=November 9, 2022 |website=New Haven Register |language=en-US |archive-date=November 9, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221109124527/https://www.nhregister.com/weather/article/Hurricane-Gloria-hit-Connecticut-30-years-ago-11342161.php |url-status=live }}</ref> The hardiness zone is 7a.

As in other cities, many of the [[elm]]s that gave New Haven the nickname "Elm City" perished in the mid-20th century due to [[Dutch elm disease]], although many have since been replanted. The [[New Haven Green]] is currently home to three separate historic churches which speak to the original theocratic nature of the city.<ref name="nhtowngreen" /> The Green remains the social center of the city today.

Violent crime levels vary dramatically among New Haven's neighborhoods, with some areas having crime rates in line with the state of Connecticut average, and others having extremely high rates of crime. A 2011 New Haven Health Department report identifies these issues in greater detail.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ctdatahaven.org/know/index.php/File:Creating_a_Healthy_and_Safe_City_2011_sml.pdf |title=File:Creating a Healthy and Safe City 2011 sml.pdf – Knowledge Center |publisher=Ctdatahaven.org |access-date=September 28, 2011 |archive-date=October 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008080733/http://www.ctdatahaven.org/know/index.php/File:Creating_a_Healthy_and_Safe_City_2011_sml.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

However, an analysis by the Regional Data Cooperative for Greater New Haven, Inc., has shown that due to issues of comparative denominators and other factors, such municipality-based rankings can be considered inaccurate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ctdatahaven.org/blog/2011/06/public_safety_new_haven/ |title=Connecticut Data Blog » Public safety concerns in our neighborhoods are legitimate, but 24/7 Wall Street's "Most Dangerous Cities" ranking is not |publisher=Ctdatahaven.org |date=June 4, 2011 |access-date=September 28, 2011 |archive-date=October 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008080741/http://www.ctdatahaven.org/blog/2011/06/public_safety_new_haven/ |url-status=live }}</ref> For example, two cities of identical population can cover widely differing land areas, making such analyses irrelevant.

As nearby [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] built new sports facilities, the [[brutalist]] New Haven Coliseum rapidly deteriorated. Believing the upkeep on the venue to be a drain of tax dollars, the DeStefano administration closed the Coliseum in 2002; it was demolished in 2007. New Haven's last professional sports team, the [[New Haven County Cutters]], left in 2009. The DeStefano administration did, however, see the construction of the New Haven Athletic Center in 1998, a {{convert|94000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} indoor athletic facility with a [[seating capacity]] of over 3,000. The NHAC, built adjacent to [[Hillhouse High School]], is used for New Haven public schools athletics, as well as large-scale area and state sporting events; it is the largest high school indoor sports complex in the state.<ref>Orzechowski, Brett.

[[File:Yalenewhavenstructure1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Collegiate Gothic architecture]] is popular in New Haven.]]

New Haven has many architectural landmarks dating from every important time period and architectural style in American history. The city has been home to a number of architects and architectural firms that have left their mark on the city including [[Ithiel Town]] and [[Henry Austin (architect)|Henry Austin]] in the 19th century and [[Cesar Pelli]], [[Warren Platner]], [[Kevin Roche]], [[Herbert Newman]] and [[Barry Svigals]] in the 20th. The [[Yale School of Architecture]] has fostered this important component of the city's economy. [[Cass Gilbert]], of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] school, designed New Haven's [[Union Station (New Haven)|Union Station]] and the New Haven Free Public Library and was also commissioned for a [[City Beautiful]] plan in 1919.

Many of the city's neighborhoods are well-preserved as walkable "museums" of 19th- and 20th-century American architecture, particularly by the [[New Haven Green]], [[Hillhouse Avenue]] and other residential sections close to [[Downtown New Haven]].

[[File:Blackrockfort.jpg|thumb|right|The restored [[Fort Nathan Hale|Black Rock Fort]]]]

In 1660, [[Edward Whalley]] (a cousin and friend of [[Oliver Cromwell]]) and [[William Goffe]], two [[English Civil War]] generals who signed the death warrant of [[King Charles I of England|King Charles I]], hid in a rock formation in New Haven after having fled England upon the [[Restoration (England)|restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] to the English throne.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Edward Whalley, the Regicide |author1=Robert Patterson Robins |author2=Edward Wale |author3=Sam.

The rock formation, which is now a part of [[West Rock Park]], is known as [[Judges' Cave]], and the path leading to the cave is called the [[Regicides Trail]].

After the [[American Revolutionary War]] broke out in 1776, the [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut colonial government]] ordered the construction of [[Fort Nathan Hale|Black Rock Fort]] (to be built on top of an older 17th-century fort) to protect the port of New Haven. In 1779, during the [[Tryon's raid|Battle of New Haven]], British soldiers captured Black Rock Fort and burned the barracks to the ground. The fort was reconstructed in 1807 by the federal government (on orders from the [[Thomas Jefferson]] administration), and rechristened [[Fort Nathan Hale]], after the [[Nathan Hale|Revolutionary War hero]] who had lived in New Haven. The cannons of Fort Nathan Hale were successful in defying British war ships during the [[War of 1812]]. In 1863, during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], a [[Fort Nathan Hale|second Fort Hale]] was built next to the original, complete with bomb-resistant bunkers and a moat, to defend the city should a [[Confederate States of America|Southern raid]] against New Haven be launched. The [[United States Congress]] deeded the site to the state in 1921, and all three versions of the fort have been restored.

[[File:New Haven Union Station from Union Avenue, December 2016.JPG|thumb|right|[[Union Station (New Haven)|Union Station]] in 2016]]

New Haven has two railroad stations, connected to [[New York City]] and points along the Northeast Corridor by [[commuter rail]], [[regional rail]] and [[inter-city rail]]. Service is provided by:
* [[Metro-North Railroad]]'s [[New Haven Line]] (commuter rail) to points west, such as Bridgeport, Stamford, Greenwich, and New York City
* [[Shore Line East]] (commuter rail) to points east, such as Old Saybrook and New London, with limited rush-hour service west to Stamford
* [[Hartford Line]] (commuter rail) to points north, such as Meriden, Hartford, Windsor, and Springfield, Massachusetts
* [[Amtrak]] (regional and intercity rail)
The city's main railroad station is the historic [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] [[Union Station (New Haven)|Union Station]], which serves Metro-North, Hartford Line, and Shore Line East commuter trains. Approximately 175 trains serve Union Station on weekdays. Union Station is also served by four Amtrak lines: the ''[[Northeast Regional]]'' and the [[high-speed rail|high-speed]] ''[[Acela Express]]'' provide service to New York, [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Boston]], and rank as the first and second busiest routes in the country; the [[New Haven–Springfield Line]] provides service to [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] and [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]; and the ''[[Vermonter (train)|Vermonter]]'' provides service to both Washington, D.C., and [[Vermont]], {{convert|15|mi|km}} from the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]]. 

An additional station, [[State Street Station (New Haven)|State Street Station]], was opened in 2002, providing passengers easier access to [[downtown New Haven]]. State Street Station is currently serviced by Shore Line East and Hartford Line trains, plus some peak-hour Metro-North trips.

Bus routes were formerly identified by letters, but as of October 8, 2017, all service was renamed using 200-series numbers, in accordance with a renumbering of CTtransit's statewide services.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cttransit.com/news/important-information-regarding-route-renumbering-and-renaming-cttransits-new-haven-area-bus |title=Important information regarding the route renumbering and renaming for CTtransit's New Haven-area bus routes |date=August 30, 2017 |website=CTtransit |access-date=February 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322204718/https://www.cttransit.com/news/important-information-regarding-route-renumbering-and-renaming-cttransits-new-haven-area-bus |archive-date=March 22, 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

CT Transit's Union Station Shuttle provides free service from Union Station to the New Haven Green and several New Haven parking garages. [[Peter Pan Bus Lines|Peter Pan]] and [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus lines have scheduled stops at Union Station, and connections downtown can be made via the Union Station Shuttle. A private company operates the New Haven/Hartford Express which provides commuter bus service to Hartford. The Yale University Shuttle provides free transportation around New Haven for Yale students, faculty, and staff.

The New Haven Division buses follow routes that had originally been covered by [[tram|trolley]] service. [[Horsecar|Horse-drawn streetcars]] began operating in New Haven in the 1860s, and by the mid-1890s all the lines had become electric. In the 1920s and 1930s, some of the trolley lines began to be replaced by bus lines, with the last trolley route converted to bus in 1948. The City of New Haven is in the very early stages of considering the restoration of streetcar (light-rail) service, which has been absent since the postwar period.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bailey |first=Melissa |url=http://www.newhavenindependent.org/archives/2007/12/a_streetcar_com.php |title=A Streetcar Comeback? |publisher=New Haven Independent |access-date=July 23, 2014 |archive-date=June 28, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628042117/http://www.newhavenindependent.org/archives/2007/12/a_streetcar_com.php |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Appel |first=Allan |url=http://www.newhavenindependent.org/archives/2008/03/street_cars_new.php |title=Where To Catch The Streetcar |publisher=New Haven Independent |access-date=July 23, 2014 |archive-date=June 28, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628142330/http://www.newhavenindependent.org/archives/2008/03/street_cars_new.php |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newhavenindependent.org/archives/upload/2008/03/New%20Haven%20Streetcar%20a%20Catalyst.pdf |title=TransSystems: New Haven Electric StreetCar A Catalyst for Development |website=New Haven Independent |access-date=July 23, 2014 |archive-date=June 27, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627204551/http://www.newhavenindependent.org/archives/upload/2008/03/New%20Haven%20Streetcar%20a%20Catalyst.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scrcog.org/toc_files/New%20Haven%20Streetcar%20Report.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929201156/http://www.scrcog.org/toc_files/New%20Haven%20Streetcar%20Report.pdf |url-status=dead |title=TranSystems/Stone Consulting & Design, "New Haven Streetcar Assessment", April 2008. |archive-date=September 29, 2011}}</ref>

==== Bikeshare ====
On February 21, 2018, New Haven officially launched its '''Bike New Haven''' bikeshare program.<ref name=":0">{{cite news |url=http://wshu.org/post/new-haven-launches-bike-share-program#stream/0 |title=New Haven Launches Bike Share Program |last=Moaton |first=Anthony |date=February 21, 2018 |work=WSHU |access-date=February 25, 2018 |archive-date=February 21, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221194102/http://wshu.org/post/new-haven-launches-bike-share-program#stream/0 |url-status=live }}</ref> based on dockless technology powered by Noa Technologies<ref>{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bike-new-haven/id1349187233?mt=8 |title=Bike New Haven |website=iTunes App Store |access-date=February 25, 2018 |archive-date=March 7, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022547/https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bike-new-haven/id1349187233?mt=8 |url-status=live }}</ref> At time of launch, the program features 10 docking stations and 100 bikes, spread throughout the urban core; there are plans to reach 30 bike stations and 300 bikes by the end of April 2018.<ref name=":0" /> The launch of the New Haven bikeshare program coincided with the launch of Yale University's own bikeshare program, which uses the same technology powered by Noa.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://to.yale.edu/news/yale-launches-new-bikeshare-program |title=Yale Launches New Bikeshare Program |last=Connor |first=Sullivan |date=December 4, 2017 |work=Yale Transportation |access-date=February 25, 2018 |archive-date=May 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200522163035/https://to.yale.edu/news/yale-launches-new-bikeshare-program |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Bike lanes ====
In 2004, the first bike lane in the city was added to Orange Street, connecting [[East Rock Park]] and the [[East Rock (neighborhood)|East Rock neighborhood]] to downtown. Since then, bike lanes have also been added to sections of Howard Ave, Elm St, Dixwell Avenue, Water Street, Clinton Avenue and State Street. The city has created recommended bike routes for getting around New Haven, including use of the Canal Trail and the Orange Street lane.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofnewhaven.com/CityPlan/pdfs/EnvironmentalInitiatives/Greenways/BikeMap_Front.pdf |title=City Cycle Map |website=Cityofnewhaven.com |access-date=March 12, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605170353/https://www.cityofnewhaven.com/CityPlan/pdfs/EnvironmentalInitiatives/Greenways/BikeMap_Front.pdf |archive-date=June 5, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofnewhaven.com/CityPlan/pdfs/EnvironmentalInitiatives/Greenways/BikeMap_Back.pdf |title=City Cycle Map by Region |website=Cityofnewhaven.com |access-date=March 12, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524014248/https://www.cityofnewhaven.com/CityPlan/pdfs/EnvironmentalInitiatives/Greenways/BikeMap_Back.pdf |archive-date=May 24, 2011}}</ref> As of the end of 2012, bicycle lanes have also been added in both directions on Dixwell Avenue along most of the street from downtown to the Hamden town line, as well as along Howard Avenue from Yale New Haven Hospital to City Point.

The city has plans to create two additional bike lanes connecting Union Station with downtown, and the [[Westville (New Haven)|Westville]] neighborhood with downtown. The city has added dozens of covered [[bicycle parking|bike parking]] spots at Union Station, in order to facilitate more bike commuting to the station.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofnewhaven.com/TrafficParking/BikePlanning.asp |title=Welcome to the New Haven Department of Transportation, Traffic and Parking |publisher=Cityofnewhaven.com |access-date=July 23, 2014 |archive-date=May 21, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521045110/http://www.cityofnewhaven.com/TrafficParking/BikePlanning.asp |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Farmington Canal Greenway ====
The [[Farmington Canal Trail]] is a [[rail trail]] that will eventually run continuously from downtown New Haven to [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]. The scenic trail follows the path of the historic [[New Haven and Northampton Company]] and the [[Farmington Canal]]. Currently, there is a continuous {{convert|14|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of the trail from downtown, through [[Hamden, Connecticut|Hamden]] and into [[Cheshire, Connecticut|Cheshire]], making [[bicycle commuting]] between New Haven and those suburbs possible. The trail is part of the [[East Coast Greenway]], a proposed {{convert|3000|mi|km|adj=on}} bike path that would link every major city on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] from [[Florida]] to [[Maine]].

=== Roads ===
[[File:Q Bridge in New Haven Illuminated Red, White, and Blue (27460771747).jpg|thumb|The [[Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge (Connecticut)|Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge]], locally known as the ''Q Bridge'', carries ten lanes over the [[Quinnipiac River]] along the [[Connecticut Turnpike]].]]
New Haven lies at the intersection of [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|Interstate 95]] on the coast—which provides access southwards and/or westwards to the western coast of Connecticut and to New York City, and eastwards to the eastern Connecticut shoreline, [[Rhode Island]], and eastern [[Massachusetts]]—and [[Interstate 91]], which leads northward to the interior of Connecticut, Massachusetts and [[Vermont]] and the Canada–US border. I-95 is infamous for traffic jams increasing with proximity to New York City; on the east side of New Haven it passes over the [[Quinnipiac River]] via the Pearl Harbor Memorial, or "[[Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge (Connecticut)|Q Bridge]]", which often presents a major bottleneck to traffic. I-91, however, is relatively less congested, except at the intersection with I-95 during peak travel times.

The [[Oak Street Connector]] ([[Connecticut Route 34]]) intersects I-91 at exit 1, just south of the I-95/I-91 interchange, and runs northwest for a few blocks as an expressway spur into downtown before emptying onto surface roads. The [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]] ([[Connecticut Route 15]]) runs parallel to I-95 west of New Haven, turning northwards as it nears the city and then running northwards parallel to I-91 through the outer rim of New Haven and [[Hamden, Connecticut|Hamden]], offering an alternative to the I-95/I-91 journey (restricted to non-commercial vehicles). Route 15 in New Haven is the site of the only highway tunnel in the state (officially designated as [[Heroes Tunnel]]), running through [[West Rock]], home to [[West Rock Park]] and the [[Three Judges Cave]].
[[File:Heros Tunnel.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]] passes through [[West Rock]] via [[Heroes Tunnel]], the only highway tunnel in Connecticut.]]
The city also has several major surface arteries. [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|U.S. Route 1]] (Columbus Avenue, Union Avenue, Water Street, Forbes Avenue) runs in an east–west direction south of downtown serving [[Union Station (New Haven)|Union Station]] and leading out of the city to [[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]], [[West Haven, Connecticut|West Haven]], [[East Haven, Connecticut|East Haven]] and [[Branford, Connecticut|Branford]]. The main road from downtown heading northwest is Whalley Avenue (partly signed as [[Connecticut Route 10|Route 10]] and [[Connecticut Route 63|Route 63]]) leading to [[Westville (New Haven)|Westville]] and [[Woodbridge, Connecticut|Woodbridge]]. Heading north towards [[Hamden, Connecticut|Hamden]], there are two major thoroughfares, Dixwell Avenue and Whitney Avenue. To the northeast are Middletown Avenue ([[Connecticut Route 17|Route 17]]), which leads to the Montowese section of North Haven, and Foxon Boulevard ([[Connecticut Route 80|Route 80]]), which leads to the Foxon section of East Haven and to the town of [[North Branford, Connecticut|North Branford]]. To the west is [[Connecticut Route 34|Route 34]], which leads to the city of [[Derby, Connecticut|Derby]]. Other major intracity arteries are [[Ella Grasso]] Boulevard ([[Connecticut Route 10|Route 10]]) west of downtown, and College Street, Temple Street, Church Street, Elm Street, and Grove Street in the downtown area.

Traffic safety is a major concern for drivers, pedestrians and cyclists in New Haven.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newhavensafestreets.org |title=NewHavenSafeStreets.org |publisher=NewHavenSafeStreets.org |date=March 8, 2014 |access-date=July 23, 2014 |archive-date=August 8, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808165458/http://www.newhavensafestreets.org/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In addition to many traffic-related fatalities in the city each year, since 2005, over a dozen Yale students, staff and faculty have been killed or injured in traffic collisions on or near the campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/ |title=Yale Daily News – The Oldest College Daily |work=Yale Daily News |access-date=March 11, 2010 |archive-date=March 14, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314030551/http://www.yaledailynews.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Airport ===
[[Tweed New Haven Airport]] is located within the city limits {{convert|3|mi|0}} east of the business district, straddling the border with neighboring East Haven. Service to approximately 25 cities is provided by [[Avelo Airlines]], which established its first East Coast base at the airport in 2021. [[Breeze Airways]] plans to begin operations at Tweed in December 2024, and will provide service to 10 destinations. The airport is currently planning a runway lengthening and new terminal on the East Haven side of the airport.

Bus service between [[Downtown New Haven]] and Tweed is available via the [[Connecticut Transit New Haven|CT Transit New Haven Division]].

=== Seaport ===
[[File:Newhaven harbor pan.png|thumb|250px|Port of New Haven]]
[[New Haven Harbor]] is home to the Port of New Haven, a deep-water seaport with three berths capable of hosting vessels and barges as well as the facilities required to handle [[break bulk cargo]]. The port has the capacity to load 200 trucks a day from the ground or via loading docks. [[Providence and Worcester Railroad]] provides freight rail transportation to the port, with the railroad operating a switch engine for yard movements, a private siding for loading and unloading, and trackage over the [[Tomlinson Lift Bridge]] toward the Northeast Corridor. Approximately {{convert|400000|sqft|m2|-4}} of inside storage and {{convert|50|acre|m2}} of outside storage are available at the site. Five shore cranes with a 250-ton capacity and 26 forklifts, each with a 26-ton capacity, are also available.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}

On June 17, 2013, the city commissioned the [[Nathan Hale (fireboat)|''Nathan Hale'']], a {{convert|36|foot|m}} port security vessel capable of serving [[search and rescue]], firefighting, and constabulary roles.<ref name="NewHavenRegister2013-06-17" /><ref name="Nhi2014-06-17">{{cite news |url=http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/nathan_hale_hits_the_harbor/ |title="Nathan Hale" hits the harbor |publisher=[[New Haven Independent]] |author=Thomas MacMillan |date=June 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231091954/http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/nathan_hale_hits_the_harbor/ |archive-date=December 31, 2013 |access-date=October 25, 2014 |url-status=dead |quote=The city recently purchased the Metalcraft Firestorm 36 using grant money from the federal Department of Homeland Security.
