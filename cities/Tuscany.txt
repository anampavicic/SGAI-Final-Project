'''Tuscany''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ʌ|s|k|ə|n|i}} {{respell|TUSK|ə|nee}}; {{langx|it|Toscana}}, {{IPA|it|tosˈkaːna|lang}}) is a [[Regions of Italy|region]] in [[central Italy]] with an area of about {{convert|23000|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}} and a population of about 3.8 million inhabitants. The regional capital is [[Florence]] ({{lang|it|Firenze}}).

Tuscany is known for its landscapes, history, artistic legacy, and its influence on [[high culture]]. It is regarded as the birthplace of the [[Italian Renaissance]]<ref>Burke, P., ''The European Renaissance: Centre and Peripheries'' (1998).</ref> and of the foundations of the [[Italian language]]. The prestige established by the Tuscan dialect's use in literature by [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Petrarch]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and [[Francesco Guicciardini]] led to its subsequent elaboration as the language of culture throughout Italy.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/storia-della-lingua_(Enciclopedia-dell'Italiano)/ |title= storia della lingua in 'Enciclopedia dell'Italiano' |publisher= Treccani.it|access-date= 28 October 2017}}</ref> It has been home to many figures influential in the history of art and science, and contains well-known museums such as the [[Uffizi]] and the [[Palazzo Pitti]]. Tuscany is also known for its [[wine]]s, including [[Chianti]], [[Vino Nobile di Montepulciano]], [[Morellino di Scansano]], [[Brunello di Montalcino]] and white [[Vernaccia di San Gimignano]]. Having a strong linguistic and cultural identity, it is sometimes considered "a nation within a nation".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Dg6AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA5|last=Hewlett |first=Maurice Henry |date=1904 |title=The road in Tuscany: a commentary |work=[[Macmillan Publishers]]}}</ref>

Tuscany is the second-most-popular [[Regions of Italy|Italian region]] for travellers in [[Italy]], after [[Veneto]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Le sei regioni italiane più visitate.

Solo le città d'arte la superano. Castiglione presenze record|date=8 October 2015}}</ref> The town of [[Castiglione della Pescaia]] is the most visited seaside destination in the region,<ref name="ilgiunco.net" /> with seaside tourism accounting for approximately 40% of tourist arrivals. The [[Maremma|Maremma region]], [[Siena]], [[Lucca]], the [[Chianti (region)|Chianti region]], [[Versilia]] and [[Val d'Orcia]] are also internationally renowned and particularly popular spots among travellers.

Eight Tuscan localities have been designated [[World Heritage Site]]s: the [[historic Centre of Florence]] (1982); the [[Piazza dei Miracoli|Cathedral square of Pisa]] (1987); the historical centre of [[San Gimignano]] (1990); the historical centre of [[Siena]] (1995); the historical centre of [[Pienza]] (1996); the [[Val d'Orcia]] (2004), the [[Medici villas|Medici Villas and Gardens]] (2013), and [[Montecatini Terme]] as part of [[the Great Spa Towns of Europe]] (2021). Tuscany has over 120 protected [[nature reserve]]s, making Tuscany and its capital Florence popular tourist destinations. In 2018, Florence alone had over 5 million arrivals, making it the world's 51st [[List of cities by international visitors|most visited city]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 100 City Destinations: 2019 Edition|url=http://go.euromonitor.com/white-paper-travel-2019-100-cities.html|access-date=17 December 2020|website=Euromonitor International}}</ref>

Roughly triangular in shape, Tuscany borders the regions of [[Liguria]] to the northwest, [[Emilia-Romagna]] to the north, [[Marche]] and [[Umbria]] to the east, and [[Lazio]] to the south and southeast. The [[comune]] (municipality) of [[Badia Tedalda]], in the Tuscan [[Province of Arezzo]], has an exclave named Ca' Raffaello within Emilia-Romagna.

Tuscany has a western coastline on the [[Ligurian Sea]] and the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], among which is the [[Tuscan Archipelago]], of which the most significant island is [[Elba]]. Tuscany has an area of approximately {{convert|22993|km2|sqmi}}. Surrounded and crossed by major mountain chains and with few (but fertile) plains, the region has a relief that is dominated by hilly country used for [[agriculture]]. Hills make up nearly two-thirds (66.5%) of the region's total area, covering {{convert|15292|km2|sqmi}}, and mountains (of which the highest are the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]), a further 25%, or {{convert|5770|km2|sqmi}}. Plains occupy 8.4% of the total area{{mdash}}{{convert|1930|km2|sqmi}}{{mdash}}mainly around the valley of the [[Arno]]. Many of Tuscany's most significant cities lie on the banks of the Arno, including the capital, [[Florence]], [[Empoli]], and [[Pisa]].

The climate is fairly mild in the coastal areas, and is harsher and rainy in the interior, with considerable fluctuations in temperature between winter and summer,<ref name="ite1geo">{{cite web | url = http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/ite1_geo.htm | title = TOSCANA - Geography and history | access-date = 9 March 2011 |url-status=dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721132424/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/ite1_geo.htm | archive-date = 21 July 2011}} Text finalised in March 2004 - Eurostat.</ref> giving the region a soil-building active freeze-thaw cycle, in part accounting for the region once having served as a key breadbasket of [[Roman Republic|ancient Rome]].<ref>[[American Heroes Channel|Military Channel]] ([[Discovery Channel|Discovery Network]]) documentary series ''Rome: Power and Glory'', episode "The Grasp of an Empire", copyright unknown, rebroadcast 11-12:00 hrs EDST, 29 June 2009.</ref>

The pre-Etruscan history of the area in the middle and late [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] parallels that of the [[Archaic period in Greece|archaic]] [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]].{{sfn|Barker|Rasmussen|2000|p=5}} The Tuscan area was inhabited by peoples of the so-called [[Apennine culture]] in the [[second millennium BC]] ({{circa|1400|1150}} BC) who had trading relationships with the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] civilizations in the [[Aegean Sea]],{{sfn|Barker|Rasmussen|2000|p=5}} and, at the end of the Bronze Age, by peoples of the so-called [[Proto-Villanovan culture]] ({{Circa|1100|900}} BC) part of the central European [[Urnfield culture]] system. Following this, at the beginning of the [[Iron Age]], the [[Villanovan culture]] ({{Circa|900|700}} BC), regarded as the oldest phase of [[Etruscan civilization]],<ref name=Neri>{{cite book |last1=Neri |first1=Diana |title=Gli etruschi tra VIII e VII secolo a.C. nel territorio di Castelfranco Emilia (MO) |date=2012 |publisher=All’Insegna del Giglio |isbn=9788878145337 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-JrCwAAQBAJ |language=it |quote =Il termine "Villanoviano" è entrato nella letteratura archeologica quando, a metà dell '800, il conte Gozzadini mise in luce le prime tombe ad incinerazione nella sua proprietà di Villanova di Castenaso, in località Caselle (BO).

=== Etruscans ===
{{Main|Etruscan civilization}}
[[File:Chimera d'arezzo, fi, 03.JPG|thumb|right|The ''[[Chimera of Arezzo]]'', Etruscan bronze, 400 BC]]
The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] (Latin: ''Tusci'') created the first major [[civilization]] in this region, large enough to establish a [[transport]] infrastructure, to implement [[agriculture]] and [[mining]] and to produce vibrant art.<ref name="Jones_2">{{Harvnb|Jones|2005|p=2}}</ref> The Etruscans lived in the area of [[Etruria]] well into prehistory.{{sfn|Barker|Rasmussen|2000|p=5}} The civilization grew to fill the area between the Arno and [[Tiber]] from the tenth century BCE, reaching its peak during the seventh and sixth centuries B.C., finally succumbing to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] by the first century BCE.{{sfn|Barker|Rasmussen|2000|p=1}} From the Etruscans, Tuscany took the name of Etruria, Tuscia for the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and subsequently Tuscania and Tuscany. While the areas of north-western Tuscany were inhabited by the ancient [[Ligures]]. In northwestern Tuscany, the area between the Arno and Magra rivers was culturally aligned with the Etruscans in the early Iron Age, and came under Ligurian control in the late Iron Age.<ref>{{Cite book |last=D Farney |first=Gary |title=The Peoples of Ancient Italy |publisher=de Gruyter |year=2017 |isbn=978-1614515203 |pages=371}}</ref>

One reason for the eventual demise of this civilization was the increasing absorption by surrounding cultures, including the adoption of the Etruscan upper class by the Romans.<ref name="Jones_2" />{{sfn|Barker|Rasmussen|2000|p=1}}

=== Romans ===
Soon after absorbing Etruria (to the north, northeast, east, and a strip to the south), Rome established the cities of [[Lucca]], [[Pisa]], [[Siena]], and [[Florence]], endowed the area with new technologies and development, and ensured peace.<ref name="Jones_2" /> These developments included extensions of existing roads, the introduction of aqueducts and sewers, and the construction of many buildings, both public and private. However, many of these structures have been destroyed by erosion due to weather.<ref name="Jones_2" />

The Roman civilization in the West of the [[Roman Republic]] and later [[Roman Empire]] collapsed in the fifth century, and the region fell briefly to [[barbarian]]s migrating through the Empire from [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Central Asia]] of the [[Goths]] (Eastern - [[Ostrogoths]] and Western - [[Visigoths]]), then was re-conquered by the revived [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (later [[Byzantine Empire]]) under the Emperor [[Justinian]]. In the years following 572, the [[Lombards]] arrived and designated [[Lucca]] the capital of their subsequent [[Tuscia]].<ref name="Jones_2" />

=== Medieval period ===
{{See also|Duchy of Tuscia|March of Tuscany}}
[[File:Battle of Montaperti.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Battle of Montaperti]], 1260]]
[[Pilgrim]]s travelling along the [[Via Francigena]] between [[Rome]] and [[France]] brought wealth and development during the [[medieval period]].<ref name="Jones_2" /> The food and shelter required by these travellers fuelled the growth of communities around churches and taverns.<ref name="Jones_2" /> The conflict between the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]], factions supporting the [[Papacy]] or the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in central and northern Italy during the 12th and 13th centuries, split the Tuscan people.<ref name="Jones_2" /> The two factions gave rise to several powerful and rich [[medieval commune]]s in Tuscany: [[Arezzo]], [[Florence]], [[Republic of Lucca|Lucca]], [[Pisa]], and [[Siena]].<ref name="Jones_2" /> Balance between these communes was ensured by the assets they held: Pisa, a port; Siena, banking; and Lucca, banking and silk.<ref name="Jones_3">{{Harvnb|Jones|2005|p=3}}</ref> But by the time of the [[Renaissance]], Florence had become the cultural capital of Tuscany.<ref name="Jones_3" />

One family that benefitted from Florence's growing wealth and power was the ruling [[Medici family]]. Its scion [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] was one of the most famous of the Medici. The legacy of his influence is visible today in the prodigious expression of art and architecture in Florence. His famous descendant [[Catherine de' Medici]] married Prince Henry (later [[Henry II of France|King Henry II]]) of France in 1533.

Tuscany, especially [[Florence]], is regarded as the birthplace of the [[Renaissance]]. Though "Tuscany" remained a linguistic, cultural, and geographic conception rather than a political reality, in the 15th century, Florence extended its dominion in Tuscany through the annexation of Arezzo in 1384, the purchase of Pisa in 1405, and the suppression of a local resistance there (1406). [[Livorno]] was bought in 1421 and became the harbour of Florence.

From the leading city of Florence, the republic was from 1434 onward dominated by the increasingly monarchical [[Medici]] family. Initially, under [[Cosimo de' Medici|Cosimo]], [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero the Gouty]], [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo]] and [[Piero the Unfortunate]], the forms of the republic were retained and the Medici ruled without a title, usually without even a formal office. These rulers presided over the [[Florentine Renaissance]]. There was a return to the republic from 1494 to 1512, when first [[Girolamo Savonarola]] then [[Piero Soderini]] oversaw the state. Cardinal Giovanni di Lorenzo de' Medici retook the city with Spanish forces in 1512, before going to Rome to become [[Pope Leo X]]. Florence was dominated by a series of papal proxies until 1527 when the citizens declared the republic again, only to have it taken from them again in 1530 after a siege by an Imperial and Spanish army. At this point [[Pope Clement VII]] and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] appointed [[Alessandro de' Medici]] as the first formal hereditary ruler.

The Sienese commune was not incorporated into Tuscany until 1555, and during the 15th century, Siena enjoyed a cultural 'Sienese Renaissance' with its own more conservative character. Lucca remained an independent republic until 1847 when it became part of [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] by the will of its people. [[Piombino]] and other strategic towns constituted the tiny [[State of the Presidi|State of the ''Presidi'']] under Spanish control.

In the 16th century, the [[House of Medici|Medicis]], rulers of Florence, annexed the [[Republic of Siena]], creating the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]]. The Medici family became extinct in 1737 with the death of [[Gian Gastone de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Gian Gastone]], and Tuscany was transferred to [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis]], [[Duke of Lorraine]] and husband of Austrian Empress [[Maria Theresa]], who let the country be ruled by his son. The dynasty of the Lorena ruled Tuscany until 1860, except during the [[Napoleonic period]], when most of the country was annexed to the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. After the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], a revolution evicted the last Grand Duke, and after a plebiscite, Tuscany became part of the new [[Kingdom of Italy]]. From 1864 to 1870 Florence became the second capital of the kingdom.

Under [[Benito Mussolini]], the area came under the dominance of local [[National Fascist Party|Fascist]] leaders such as [[Dino Perrone Compagni]] (from Florence), and [[Costanzo Ciano|Costanzo]] and [[Galeazzo Ciano]] (from [[Livorno]]). Following the fall of Mussolini and the armistice of 8 September 1943, Tuscany became part of the Nazi-controlled [[Italian Social Republic]] and was conquered almost totally by the Anglo-American forces during the summer of 1944.

Following the end of the Social Republic and the transition from the Kingdom to the modern [[Italy|Italian Republic]], Tuscany once more flourished as a cultural centre of Italy. Since the establishment of the regional government in 1970, Tuscany has always been ruled by centre-left governments.

== Culture ==
{{See also|List of museums in Tuscany}}
Tuscany has an immense cultural and artistic heritage, expressed in the region's churches, palaces, art galleries, museums, villages, and piazzas. Many of these artifacts are found in the main cities, such as [[Florence]] and [[Siena]], but also in smaller villages scattered around the region, such as [[San Gimignano]].

=== Art ===
[[File:'David' by Michelangelo Fir JBU005 denoised.jpg|upright=0.85|thumb|right|[[David (Michelangelo)|Michelangelo's ''David'']]]]
Tuscany has a unique artistic legacy, and Florence is one of the world's most important water-colour centres, even so that it is often nicknamed the "art palace of Italy" (the region is also believed to have the largest concentration of Renaissance art and architecture in the world).<ref>{{cite web |last=Miner |first=Jennifer |url=http://travelguide.affordabletours.com/search/Article/guide/19/ |title=Florence Art Tours, Florence Museums, Florence Architecture |publisher=Travelguide.affordabletours.com |date=2 September 2008 |access-date=18 April 2010 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129061226/http://travelguide.affordabletours.com/search/Article/guide/19 |archive-date=29 January 2010}}</ref> Painters such as [[Cimabue]] and [[Giotto]], the fathers of Italian painting, lived in Florence and Tuscany, as well as Arnolfo and [[Andrea Pisano]], renewers of architecture and sculpture; [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Donatello]] and [[Masaccio]], forefathers of the Renaissance; [[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]] and the [[Della Robbia]]s, [[Filippo Lippi]] and [[Fra Angelico|Angelico]]; [[Botticelli]], [[Paolo Uccello]], and the universal genius of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.learner.org/interactives/renaissance/florence_sub2.html| title=Florentine Art and Architecture| publisher=Annenberg Learner| access-date=28 January 2016}}</ref><ref>Renaissance Artists {{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/2838/artgal.htm |title=Artists of the Italian Renaissance |access-date=28 September 2010 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124033248/http://library.thinkquest.org/2838/artgal.htm |archive-date=24 November 2010}}</ref>

The region contains numerous museums and art galleries, many housing some of the world's most precious works of art. Such museums include the [[Uffizi]], which keeps Botticelli's ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'', the [[Palazzo Pitti]], and the [[Bargello]], to name a few. Most of the frescos, sculptures, and paintings in Tuscany are held in the region's abundant churches and cathedrals, such as [[Florence Cathedral]], [[Siena Cathedral]], [[Pisa Cathedral]] and the [[Collegiata di San Gimignano]].

=== Art schools ===
{{Main|Florentine painting|Sienese School|Lucchese School}}
[[File:Pietro lorenzetti, compianto (dettaglio) basilica inferiore di assisi (1310-1329).jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|A painting from the [[Sienese School]] by [[Pietro Lorenzetti]]]]
In the medieval period and the Renaissance, four main Tuscan art schools competed against each other: the [[Florentine School]], the [[Sienese School]], the Pisan School, and the [[Lucchese School]].
* The Florentine School refers to artists in, from, or influenced by the [[realism (arts)|naturalistic]] style developed in the 14th century, largely through the efforts of [[Giotto di Bondone]], and in the 15th century the leading school of the world. Some of the best known artists of the Florentine School are [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Donatello]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Botticelli]], [[Filippo Lippi|Lippi]], [[Masolino da Panicale|Masolino]], and [[Masaccio]].
* The Sienese School of painting flourished in [[Siena]] between the 13th and 15th centuries and for a time rivaled Florence, though it was more conservative, being inclined towards the decorative beauty and elegant grace of late [[Gothic art]]. Its most important representatives include [[Duccio]], whose work shows Byzantine influence; his pupil [[Simone Martini]]; [[Pietro Lorenzetti|Pietro]] and [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]]; [[Domenico di Bartolo|Domenico]] and [[Taddeo di Bartolo]]; and [[Stefano di Giovanni|Sassetta]] and [[Matteo di Giovanni]]. Unlike the naturalistic Florentine art, there is a mystical streak in Sienese art,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} characterized by a common focus on miraculous events, distortions of time and place, and often dreamlike coloration, with less attention to proportions. In the 16th century, the Mannerists [[Domenico di Pace Beccafumi|Beccafumi]] and [[Il Sodoma]] worked there. While Baldassare Peruzzi was born and trained in Siena, his major works and style reflect his long career in Rome. The economic and political decline of Siena by the 16th century, and its eventual subjugation by Florence, largely checked the development of Sienese painting, although it also meant that many Sienese works in churches and public buildings were not discarded or destroyed by new paintings or rebuilding. Siena remains a remarkably well-preserved Italian late-Medieval town.
* The Lucchese School, also known as the School of Lucca and as the Pisan-Lucchese School, was a school of painting and sculpture that flourished in the 11th and 12th centuries in the western and southern part of the region, with an important centre in [[Volterra]]. The art is mostly anonymous. Although not as elegant or delicate as the Florentine School, Lucchese works are remarkable for their monumentality.

=== Language ===
{{Main|Tuscan dialect}}
Apart from standard [[Italian language|Italian]], the [[Tuscan dialect]] (''dialetto toscano'') is spoken in Tuscany. The Italian language is based historically on literary Tuscan, specifically the [[Florentine dialect]]. It became the language of culture for all the people of Italy, thanks to the prestige of the masterpieces of [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Petrarch]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and [[Francesco Guicciardini]]. It would later become the official language of all the [[List of historic states of Italy|Italian states]] and of the [[Kingdom of Italy]], when it was formed. Many Tuscan terms are also common in the dialects of [[Umbria]] and some parts of [[Emilia-Romagna|Emilia Romagna]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_F4C4AXtLFIC&pg=PA13|title=The Other Italy: The Literary Canon in Dialect|last=Haller|first=Hermann W.|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|date=1999|access-date=5 May 2022|pages=12–14, 25, 179, 202|isbn=0-8020-4424-7}}</ref>

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of Tuscany}}
{{See also|Music of Florence}}
[[File:GiacomoPuccini.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Giacomo Puccini]]]]
Tuscany has a rich ancient and modern musical tradition, and has produced numerous composers and musicians, including [[Giacomo Puccini]] and [[Pietro Mascagni]]. Florence is the main musical centre of Tuscany. The city was at the heart of much of the Western musical tradition. It was there that the [[Florentine Camerata]] convened in the mid-16th century and experimented with setting tales of [[Greek mythology]] to music and staging, resulting in the first [[opera]]s, fostering the further development of the operatic form, and the later developments of separate "classical" forms such as the [[symphony]].

There are numerous musical centres in Tuscany. [[Arezzo]] is indelibly connected with the name of [[Guido d'Arezzo]], the 11th-century monk who invented modern [[musical notation]] and the [[solfège|do-re-mi]] system of naming notes of the scale; [[Lucca]] hosted possibly the greatest Italian composer of [[Verismo]], [[Giacomo Puccini]] together with [[Alfredo Catalani]], while [[Pietro Mascagni]] was born in [[Livorno]]; and [[Siena]] is well known for the [[Accademia Musicale Chigiana]], an organization that currently sponsors major musical activities such as the Siena Music Week and the Alfredo Casella International Composition Competition. Other important musical centres in Tuscany include [[Pisa]] and [[Grosseto]].{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

=== Literature ===
[[File:Francesco Petrarca00.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Tuscan poet and literary figure [[Petrarch]]]]
Several famous writers and poets are from Tuscany, most notably Florentine author [[Dante Alighieri]]. Tuscany's literary scene particularly thrived in the 13th century and the Renaissance.

In Tuscany, especially in the Middle Ages, popular love poetry existed. A school of imitators of the Sicilians was led by [[Dante da Maiano]], but its literary originality took another line – that of humorous and satirical poetry. The democratic form of government created a style of poetry that stood strongly against the medieval mystic and chivalrous style. Devout invocation of God or a lady came from the [[cloister]] and the [[castle]]; in the streets of the cities everything that had gone before was treated with ridicule or biting [[sarcasm]]. [[Folgóre da San Gimignano]] laughs when in his sonnets he tells a party of Sienese youths the occupations of every month in the year, or when he teaches a party of Florentine lads the pleasures of every day in the week. Cenne della Chitarra laughs when he parodies Folgore's sonnets. The sonnets of Rustico di Filippo are half-fun and half-satire, as is the work of [[Cecco Angiolieri]] of Siena, the oldest humorist we{{who|date=April 2024}} know, a far-off precursor of [[François Rabelais]] and [[Michel de Montaigne]].{{citation needed|date=April 2024}}

Another type of poetry also began in Tuscany. Guittone d'Arezzo made art abandon chivalry and [[Provence|Provençal]] forms for national motives and Latin forms. He attempted political poetry, and although his work is often obscure, he prepared the way for the Bolognese school. [[Bologna]] was the city of science, and [[philosophy|philosophical]] poetry appeared there. [[Guido Guinizelli]] was the poet after the new fashion of the art. In his work, the ideas of [[chivalry]] are changed and enlarged. Only those whose heart is pure can be blessed with true love, regardless of class. He refuted the traditional credo of [[courtly love]], for which love is a subtle philosophy only a few chosen knights and princesses could grasp. Love is blind to blasons but not to a good heart when it finds one: when it succeeds it is the result of the spiritual, not physical affinity between two souls. Guinizzelli's democratic view can be better understood in the light of the greater equality and freedom enjoyed by the city-states of the center-north and the rise of a middle class eager to legitimise itself in the eyes of the old nobility, still regarded with respect and admiration but dispossessed of its political power.{{citation needed|date=April 2024}}

Guinizelli's ''[[canzone|Canzoni]]'' make up the bible of [[Dolce Stil Novo]], and one in particular, "Al cor gentil" ("To a Kind Heart") is considered{{by whom|date=April 2024}} the manifesto of the new movement which would bloom in Florence under [[Guido Cavalcanti|Cavalcanti]], Dante and their followers. His poetry has some of the faults of the school of d'Arezzo. Nevertheless, he marks a great development in the history of Italian art, especially because of his close connection with Dante's [[lyric poetry]].

In the 13th century, there were several major [[allegory|allegorical poems]]. One of these is by [[Brunetto Latini]], who was a close friend of Dante. His ''Tesoretto'' is a short poem, in seven-syllable verses, rhyming in couplets, in which the author professes to be lost in a wilderness and to meet with a lady, who represents Nature, from whom he receives much instruction. We see here the vision, the allegory, the instruction with a moral object, three elements which we shall find again in the ''Divine Comedy''. [[Francesco da Barberino]], a learned lawyer who was secretary to [[bishop]]s, a [[judge]], and a [[notary public|notary]], wrote two little allegorical poems, the ''Documenti d'amore'' and ''Del reggimento e dei costumi delle donne''. The poems today are generally studied not as literature, but for historical context. A fourth allegorical work was the ''Intelligenza'', which is sometimes attributed to Compagni but is probably only a translation of French poems.<ref>Granacki, Alyssa. Duke University. [https://sites.duke.edu/danteslibrary/basilica-one-column/ Brunetto Latini, Tesoretto]. Retrieved 24 August 2020.</ref>

In the 15th century, [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] and publisher [[Aldus Manutius]] published the Tuscan poets Petrarch and Dante Alighieri (''[[Divine Comedy]]''), creating the model for what became a standard for modern Italian.

=== Cuisine ===

{{See also|Tuscan wine}}
[[File:Salumi e vino lucchese.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.05|An assortment of Tuscan foods: various wine and cheese, and different sorts of salamis and hams]]
Simplicity is central to [[Tuscan food|Tuscan cuisine]]. [[Legume]]s, bread, cheese, vegetables, mushrooms, and fresh fruit are used. [[Olive oil]] is made from Moraiolo, [[Leccino]] and Frantoiano olives. White [[truffle]]s from [[San Miniato]] appear in October and November. Beef of the highest quality comes from the [[Chiana Valley]], specifically, a breed known as [[Chianina]] used for [[Florentine steak]]. The indigenous [[Cinta Senese]] breed of [[pork]] is also produced.<ref>Piras, 221-239.{{Clarify|date=January 2010}}</ref>

Wine is a famous and common produce of Tuscany. The red wine [[Chianti]] is perhaps the most well-known internationally. Due to the many British tourists who come to the area where Chianti wine is produced this specific area has been nicknamed "[[Chiantishire]]".

=== Postage stamps ===
{{Main|Postage stamps and postal history of Tuscany}}
Between 1851 and 1860, the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], an independent Italian state until 1859 when it joined the [[United Provinces of Central Italy]], produced two postage stamp issues which are among the most prized [[classic stamp]] issues of the world, and include the most valuable Italian stamp. The Grand Duchy of Tuscany was an independent Italian state from 1569 to 1859 but was occupied by [[France]] from 1808 to 1814. The Duchy comprised most of the present area of Tuscany, and its capital was Florence. In December 1859, the Grand Duchy officially ceased to exist, being joined to the duchies of [[Duchy of Modena and Reggio|Modena]] and [[Duchy of Parma|Parma]] to form the United Provinces of Central Italy, which was annexed by the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] a few months later in March 1860. In 1862 it became part of Italy and joined the Italian postal system.

== Economy ==
The [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was 117.5 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 6.7% of Italy's economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 31,400 euros or 104% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 106% of the EU average.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|website=Eurostat}}</ref>

=== Agriculture ===
[[File:Autunno in Chianti Toscana.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|right|Vineyards in the [[Chianti]] region]]
The subsoil in Tuscany is relatively rich in mineral resources, with iron ore, copper, mercury, and [[lignite]] mines, the famous ''soffioni'' ([[fumarole]]) at [[Larderello]], and the vast marble mines in [[Versilia]]. Although its share is falling all the time, agriculture still contributes to the region's economy. In the region's inland areas cereals, potatoes, olives, and grapes are grown. The swamplands, which used to be marshy, now produce vegetables, rice, tobacco, beets, and sunflowers.<ref name="ite1geo" />

=== Industry ===
One of the traditional foundations of the industrial sector is mining, given the abundance of underground resources. Also of note are textiles and clothing, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, steel and metalworking, glass and ceramics, and printing and publishing. Smaller areas specialising in manufacturing and craft industries are found in the hinterland: the leather and footwear area in the south-west part of the province of Florence, the hot-house plant area in [[Pistoia]], the ceramics and textile industries in the [[Prato]] area, scooters, and motorcycles in [[Pontedera]], and the processing of timber for the manufacture of wooden furniture in the [[Cascina]] area. The heavy industries (mining, steel, and mechanical engineering) are concentrated along the coastal strip ([[Livorno]] and [[Pisa]] areas), where there are also important chemical industries. Also of note are the marble ([[Carrara]] area) and paper industries ([[Lucca]] area).<ref name="ite1geo" />

=== Tourism ===
In Tuscany 80% of tourism demand is concentrated in cities of art and seaside resorts, the rest is divided between the countryside, hills, and mountains.

[[File:Via de Tornabuoni 03.JPG|thumb|The [[Via de' Tornabuoni]] in Florence, the city's top fashion and shopping street, contains some of the world's most luxurious clothing and jewelry houses, such as [[Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]], [[Salvatore Ferragamo S.p.A.|Ferragamo]], [[Gucci]], [[Versace]] and [[Bulgari]].]]
The fashion and [[textile]] industry are the pillars of the Florentine economy. In the 15th century, Florentines were working with luxury textiles such as wool and silk. Today the greatest designers in Europe utilize the textile industry in Tuscany, and especially Florence. A large plant of production is happening in the town of [[Prato]].

Italy has one of the strongest textile industries in Europe, accounting for approximately one-quarter of European production. Its turnover is over 25 billion euros. It is the third largest supplier of clothing after China and Japan. The Italian fashion industry generates 60% of its turnover abroad.<ref>[http://www.citemedmode.com/fr/fiche-pays-italie/fiche-italie.html#] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202124909/http://www.citemedmode.com/fr/fiche-pays-italie/fiche-italie.html#|date=2 February 2009}}</ref>

The population density of Tuscany, with {{convert|161|PD/km2}} in 2008, is below the national average ({{convert|198.8|PD/km2|abbr=on|disp=or}}). This is due to the low population density of the provinces of Arezzo, Siena, and especially Grosseto ({{convert|50|PD/km2|abbr=on|disp=or}}). The highest density is found in the province of Prato ({{convert|675|PD/km2|abbr=on|disp=or}}), followed by the provinces of Pistoia, Livorno, Florence and Lucca, peaking in the cities of Florence (more than {{convert|3500|PD/km2|abbr=on|disp=or}}), Livorno, Prato, Viareggio, Forte dei Marmi and Montecatini Terme (all with a population density of more than {{convert|1000|PD/km2|abbr=on|disp=or}}). The territorial distribution of the population is closely linked to the socio-cultural and, more recently, economic and industrial development of Tuscany.<ref name="ite1geo" />

Accordingly, the least densely populated areas are those where the main activity is agriculture, unlike the others where, despite the presence of several large industrial complexes, the main activities are connected with tourism and associated services, alongside many small firms in the leather, glass, paper and clothing sectors.<ref name="ite1geo" />

[[Italians]] make up 93% of the total population. Starting from the 1980s, the region has attracted a large flux of immigrants, particularly from [[China]], [[Romania]], [[Albania]] and [[Morocco]]. There is also a significant community of British and American residents. {{As of|2008}}, the Italian national institute of statistics ISTAT estimated that 275,149 foreign-born immigrants live in Tuscany, equal to 7% of the total regional population.

== Government and politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Tuscany}}
The [[President of Tuscany]] is the [[head of government]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the [[Regional Council of Tuscany]], while [[executive power]] is exercised by the Regional Government led by the President, who is directly elected by the people. The current Statute, which regulates the functioning of the regional institutions, has been in force since 2005.

Tuscany is a stronghold of the centre-left [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] (PD), forming with [[Emilia-Romagna]], [[Umbria]] and [[Marche]] the so-called Italian political "[[Red belt (Italy)|Red Quadrilateral]]". Since 1970, Tuscany has been continuously governed by left-wing governments.

== Administrative divisions ==
Tuscany is divided into nine provinces and one Metropolitan City:
