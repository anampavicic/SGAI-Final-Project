Until 1929, the city was known in Russian as '''Dyushambe''',{{efn|{{langx|ru|Дюшамбе}} {{IPA|ru|dʲʊʂɐmˈbɛ|}}}} and from 1929 to 1961 as '''Stalinabad''',{{efn|{{langx|tg|Сталинобод|Stalinobod}}, {{IPA-all|(ɪ)stɐlinɔˈbɔd|pron}}; {{langx|ru|link=no|Сталинабад}} {{IPA|ru|stəlʲɪnɐˈbat|}}}} after [[Joseph Stalin]]. Dushanbe is located in the [[Gissar Valley]], bounded by the [[Gissar Range]] in the north and east and the [[Babatag Range|Babatag]], Aktau, Rangontau and Karatau mountains in the south, and has an elevation of 750–930 m. The city is divided into four districts: [[Ismail Samani]], [[Avicenna]], [[Ferdowsi]], and [[Mansur I|Shah Mansur]].

In ancient times, what is now or is close to modern Dushanbe was settled by various empires and peoples, including [[Mousterian]] tool-users, various [[neolithic]] cultures, the [[Achaemenid Empire]], [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactria]], the [[Kushan Empire]], and [[Hephthalites]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], more settlements began near modern-day Dushanbe such as [[Hulbuk]] and its [[Palace of the governor of Khulbuk|famous palace]]. From the 17th to early 20th century, Dushanbe grew into a market village controlled at times by the Beg of [[Hisor]], [[Balkh]], and finally [[Emirate of Bukhara|Bukhara]], before being conquered by the [[Russian Empire]]. Dushanbe was captured by the [[Bolsheviks]] in 1922, and the town was made the capital of the [[Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] in 1924, which commenced Dushanbe's development and rapid population growth that continued until the [[Tajik civil war|Tajik Civil War]]. After the war, the city became capital of an independent [[Tajikistan]] and continued its growth and development into a modern city, today home to many international conferences.

Much of Dushanbe's education system dates from Soviet times and has a legacy of state control; today the largest university in Dushanbe, the [[Tajik National University]], is funded by the government. [[Dushanbe International Airport]] is the primary airport serving the city. Other forms of transport include the [[Trolleybuses in Dushanbe|trolleybus system]] dating from 1955, the small rail system, and the roads that traverse the city. Dushanbe's electricity is primarily hydroelectric, produced by the [[Nurek Dam]], and the aging water system dates from 1932. Tajikistan's healthcare system is concentrated in Dushanbe, meaning that the major hospitals of the country are in the city. The city makes up 20% of Tajikistan's GDP and has large industrial, financial, retail, and tourism sectors. Parks and main sights of the city include [[Victory Park, Dushanbe|Victory Park]], [[Rudaki Park]], the [[Tajikistan National Museum]], the [[Dushanbe Flagpole]], and the [[Tajikistan National Museum of Antiquities]].

Dushanbe was chosen instead of larger-populated villages in [[Tajikistan]] because of its role as a crossroads of Tajikistan for its large market served as a meeting place for much of Tajikistan's population. Along with its market, there was a lively [[livestock]] trade as well as trade in [[fabrics]], [[leather]], [[Tin|tin products]], and [[weapon]]s.<ref name="Фергана-2020" /> The mild [[Mediterranean climate]] was another reason Soviet authorities chose the city as the capital.<ref name="Вечёрка-2019" />

==== Riots and unrest ====
{{Main|1990 Dushanbe riots}}
[[File:RIAN archive 699865 Dushanbe riots, February 1990.jpg|thumb|February 1990 Riots in Dushanbe]]

In the 1980s, environmental problems and crime began to increase. Mass violence, hooliganism, binge drinking, and violent assaults became more common. There was an attack on foreign students at the [[Agricultural University of Tajikistan|Agricultural Institute]] in 1987 and a riot in the Pedagogical Institute two years later. Increasing regionalism also destabilized the [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic|SSR]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nourzhanov, Kirill|title=Tajikistan a political and social history|date=2013|publisher=ANU E Press|isbn=978-1-925021-16-5|page=156|oclc=984803513}}</ref>

On 10–11 February 1990, 300 demonstrators gathered at the Communist Party Central Committee building after it was rumored that [[Government of the Soviet Union|the Soviet government]] planned to relocate tens of thousands of [[Armenians|Armenian]] refugees to [[Tajikistan]]. In reality, only 29 Armenians went to Dushanbe and were housed by their family members. However, the crowd kept growing in size to 3-5 thousand people; soon after, violence broke out. [[Martial law]] was quickly declared and troops were sent in to protect [[Ethnic minorities in Tajikistan|ethnic minorities]] and defend against vandalism and looting. The number of people protesting increased significantly, however, and they attacked the Central Committee building. The 29 [[Armenians]] were quickly evacuated on an emergency flight after shots were fired.<ref name="Nourzhanov-2013b" />

A few days after, and with looting still occurring throughout the city, demonstrators created the [[Provisional People's Committee]], or the Temporary Committee for Crisis Resolution, which put forward demands such as "the expulsion of Armenian refugees, the resignation of the government and the removal of the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan|Communist Party]], the closure of an aluminum smelter in western Tajikistan for environmental reasons, equitable distribution of profits from [[Agriculture in Tajikistan|cotton production]], and the release of 25 protesters taken into custody."<ref name="Nourzhanov-2013b" />

Many high-ranking officials resigned and the protector's goal of toppling the government was almost successful, but [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops moved into the city, declared the demands illegal, and rejected the resignation of the high-ranking officials. 16-25 people were killed in the violence; many if not most were Russian.<ref name="Nourzhanov-2013b">{{Cite book|last=Nourzhanov, Kirill|title=Tajikistan a political and social history|date=2013|publisher=ANU E Press|isbn=978-1-925021-16-5|pages=180–183|oclc=984803513}}</ref>

The riots were largely fueled by concerns about housing shortages for the Tajik population, but they coincided with a wave of nationalist unrest that swept [[Transcaucasia]] and other Central Asian states during the twilight of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s rule.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0D8103EF930A25751C0A966958260 Ethnic rioting in Dushanbe], New York Times, 13 February 1990.

After the increase of organized opposition from the [[Democratic Party of Tajikistan]] and [[Rastokhez]], [[glasnost]] by [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]], economic contraction, and increased opposition by regional elites, [[Qahhor Mahkamov]] disbanded the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]] on 27 August 1991 and quit the party the next day. On 9 September 1991, Tajikistan's government declared independence from the Soviet Union.<ref name="Nourzhanov-2013">{{Cite book|last=Nourzhanov, Kirill|title=Tajikistan a political and social history|date=2013|publisher=ANU E Press|isbn=978-1-925021-16-5|chapter=The Rise of Opposition, the Contraction of the State and the Road to Independence|oclc=984803513}}</ref>

=== Flora and fauna ===
Before the 20th century, the city had some vegetation such as bushes of Bukhara almonds, but the creation of the city mostly removed natural vegetation. The [[green belt]], however, and the botanical garden introduced new vegetation to the city. The city has over 150 species of trees and shrubs, with only about 15 native to the city<ref name="Dushanbe Encyc-2004" /> and 22% of the city being occupied by green space.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Environmental Protection|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65068362|title=Dushanbe : ėnt︠s︡iklopedii︠a︡|publisher=Glavnai︠a︡ nauchnai︠a︡ redakt︠s︡ii︠a︡ Tadzhikskoĭ nat︠s︡ionalʹnoĭ ėnt︠s︡iklopedii|others=Dinorshoev, Muso.|year=2004|isbn=5-89870-071-4|location=Dushanbe|oclc=65068362|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028115236/http://dushanbe.tj/img/ENS.doc|archive-date=28 October 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Троллейбус (шаҳри Душанбе).jpg|thumb|Trolleybuses in Dushanbe]]
The [[Trolleybuses in Dushanbe|Dushanbe trolleybus system]] began on 6 April 1955 when a trolleybus administration was organized in the city. On 1 May 1955, the first [[Trolza]] trolleybus began operation on Lenin Avenue, the main avenue of Dushanbe. Routes continued to be added in 1957 and 1958 and in 1967, 9 routes were opened and the length of the network reached {{Convert|49|km|mi}}. The [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] led to a crisis in the system, as fuel increased in price and looting became a consistent problem, with one incident occurring at the central bus station leading to the temporary suspension of lines. During the period, the number of trolleybuses declined from a high of 250 during the late 1980s to only 45–50. 100 new trolleybuses were ordered in 2004 which were delivered a couple years after and aided in the resumption of service.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2012-04-16|title=КАвЗ: в будущее - с оптимизмом|url=http://www.omnibus.ru/arhiv/1-2_2008/arhivarius/|access-date=2020-08-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416110626/http://www.omnibus.ru/arhiv/1-2_2008/arhivarius/|archive-date=16 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Kluczewska|first=Karolina|title=Dushanbe buses and what it means to live in a capital city|url=https://www.academia.edu/42097027|website=www.academia.edu}}</ref>

=== Architecture ===
Before the Soviet invasion, Dushanbe consisted of narrow streets with [[adobe]] buildings.<ref name="Dushanbe Encyc-2004e">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65068362|title=Dushanbe : ėnt︠s︡iklopedii︠a︡|date=2004|publisher=Glavnai︠a︡ nauchnai︠a︡ redakt︠s︡ii︠a︡ Tadzhikskoĭ nat︠s︡ionalʹnoĭ ėnt︠s︡iklopedii|others=Dinorshoev, Muso.|isbn=5-89870-071-4|location=Dushanbe|chapter=Buildings|oclc=65068362|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028115236/http://dushanbe.tj/img/ENS.doc|archive-date=28 October 2010}}</ref> None of the buildings from that time survived.<ref name=robert>{{cite news |last1=Robert |first1=Judith |title=Redeveloping Dushanbe |url=https://mailchi.mp/meduza.io/redeveloping-dushanbe?e=263588e574 |work=The Beet |date=December 2023}}</ref> The development of the 1920s, soon after the Soviet invasion, laid the groundwork for future development and established the beginning of the city.

He drew up a piece of legislation called "On the construction of the city of Dushanbe" which the city adopted on 27 April 1927. He implemented a constructivist design in the city, possibly inspired by his meeting with [[Le Corbusier]] in Moscow in 1929.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Первый архитектор Душанбе.

In 1934 and 1935, the Griprogor Institute, based in [[Leningrad]], created a master plan for the construction of Dushanbe. It was approved on 3 March 1938. The city center during the reconstruction shifted to Red Square and Frunze Park, the location of many workers demonstrations and military parades into the forties. In the later half of the decade, much of the modern infrastructure and utilities for the city were created. In the 1940s, architecture was focused more on decoration and the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical style]].<ref name="Tilloev-2007" /><ref name="Mehrotra-2008" />

1955 heralded in a new era of architecture with the publication of "On the elimination of excesses in the design," which eventually ended the neoclassical period and integrated the city architecture into modernist, minimalistic Soviet trends.<ref name="Tilloev-2007" /> In 1966, a new master plan for the city was created due to the city's rapid growth.<ref name="Mehrotra-2008" /> [[File:Биноҳои Душанбе 23.jpg|thumb|Modern high-rise architecture in Dushanbe]] The first [[skyscraper]] in Dushanbe, the Hotel Dushanbe, was erected in 1964.<ref name="Abdullaev-2018b" /> [[High-rise building]]s were developed in the mid-70s against the wishes of the Tajik Institute of [[Earthquake engineering|Earthquake Engineering]] and [[Seismology]], which viewed such developments as dangerous in an [[earthquake]] which they predicted would occur in the near future.<ref name="Rusu-2016" /><ref name="Davidzon-1983d"/>

In the 1980s, more technically complex and creative designs were built by a new generation of architects along with more attention on ecological issues.<ref name="Tilloev-2007" /> In the late 1990s, more 9-12 story concrete houses were built and private companies grew to 75% of the housing market.<ref name="Dushanbe Encyc-2004e" /> Minimalist influences continued to be felt from the 60s up to the 90s.<ref name="Mehrotra-2008" />

In the 21st century, new construction projects such as tall skyscrapers, a new parliament building, and the national museum were or are being built. However, the new architectural styles of the modern day resulted in the demolition of many historical, Soviet-era buildings in the center of the city, such as the Central Post Office and the Mayakovsky Theatre, with the exception of a small list of 15 historically significant buildings.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Dushanbe|first=Esfandiar Adineh in|date=2017-10-19|title=Demolishing Dushanbe: how the former city of Stalinabad is erasing its Soviet past|url=http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/oct/19/demolishing-dushanbe-former-stalinabad-erasing-soviet-past|access-date=2020-09-19|website=the Guardian}}</ref><ref name="Hughes-2017" /><ref name=robert/> The central city mainly consists of wide boulevards and Russian-style buildings today,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Humphrey|first=Caroline|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/815668567|title=Post-Cosmopolitan Cities : Explorations of Urban Coexistence.|date=2012|publisher=Berghahn Books|others=Vera Skvirskaja|isbn=978-0-85745-511-6|location=New York, NY|chapter=‘For Badakhshan – the Country without Borders!’: Village Cosmopolitans, Urban-Rural Networks and the Post-Cosmopolitan City in Tajikistan|oclc=815668567}}</ref> while suburban areas are comparatively underdeveloped.<ref name="Hughes-2017" />

Tajikistan has the highest average annual precipitation in its region, along with numerous rivers, natural lakes (such as [[Karakul (Tajikistan)|Lake Karakul]]), and glaciers.

=== Healthcare ===
[[File:Big Hospital.jpg|thumb|Istiqlol Medical Complex]]

The 1920s saw the birth of drama in the city. The first, Lahouti theater, was built in 1929. In the 1930s, Soviet themes like class struggle, fighting against the past, and gender equality were prominent in plays. In 1935, the Tajik Musical Theater, now the Ayni theater, was built.<ref name="Dushanbe Encyc-2004j" /><ref name="Dushanbe Encyc-2004i" /> A comedy troupe was created in 1944 and after the war young artists influenced plays in Dushanbe, influencing the creation of the Tajik State Youth Theater.<ref name="Dushanbe Encyc-2004j" />

Continuing with a nationalist tradition, Tajik classics were made into plays. During World War 2, plays were focused on the war and historical themes from the 1950s onward. In the 70s and 80s foreign plays, like [[Oedipus Rex]], were introduced to Dushanbe. After independence, plays focused primarily on the devastating civil war.<ref name="Dushanbe Encyc-2004i" /><ref name="Dushanbe Encyc-2004j" /> Today, some theaters are the Tajik Academic Opera and Ballet Theater, the State Russian Drama Theater, the youth theater, the State Experimental Theater, and the republican puppet theater.<ref name="Dushanbe Encyc-2004j" />

The [[Mayakovsky Theatre (Dushanbe)|Mayakovsky Theatre]] was Tajikistan's oldest theatre and last surviving Russian-language theatre company; it was demolished in 2016 as part of the government's wholesale destruction of numerous 20th-century buildings of historical and architectural interest.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Actors Mourn as Tajikistan's Oldest Theater Is Torn Down {{!}} Eurasianet|url=https://eurasianet.org/actors-mourn-tajikistans-oldest-theater-torn-down|access-date=2021-02-26|website=eurasianet.org}}</ref>

Dushanbe became the center of Tajik literature in the 1920s with figures such as [[Sadriddin Ayni]], [[Abolqasem Lahouti]], and [[Payrav Sulaymoni]] along with new Soviet literature calling for revolution and social equality and Tajik nationalist literature. Children's books and translated works also had their beginnings in this period. In the 1930s, young Russian writers influenced the literature of the city, part of the "Komsomol generation." The themes often touched on the rapid development of Dushanbe during the 30s.<ref name="Dushanbe Encyc-2004i">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65068362|title=Dushanbe : ėnt︠s︡iklopedii︠a︡|date=2004|publisher=Glavnai︠a︡ nauchnai︠a︡ redakt︠s︡ii︠a︡ Tadzhikskoĭ nat︠s︡ionalʹnoĭ ėnt︠s︡iklopedii|others=Dinorshoev, Muso.|isbn=5-89870-071-4|location=Dushanbe|chapter=Literary Life|oclc=65068362|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028115236/http://dushanbe.tj/img/ENS.doc|archive-date=28 October 2010}}</ref>

During World War 2, literature shifted towards patriotic and militaristic themes of protecting the motherland in shorter formats than novels. Messages from the frontlines and satires became popular. Russian literature also became known, partially due to the movement of factories and people from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|frontlines of the war]] to the east. After the war, prose works and poetry, with poets like [[Mirzo Tursunzoda]], became more popular along with the continuation of genres from previous decades. Literary criticism developed along with analysis of individual writers.<ref name="Dushanbe Encyc-2004i" />

From the 1950s, the historical revolutionary genre developed, prompting authors to use history for inspiration. In the 60s the new genre of science fiction began in the city with writers like [[Mirsaid Mirshakar]]. In the 70s and 80s the themes of disorder gained more prominence, not coincidentally soon before the Soviet Union's collapse. In poetry, civic and philosophical lyrical themes were most popular.<ref name="Dushanbe Encyc-2004i" /> After independence, previously forbidden subjects like religion started to appear in literature, along with reflections on the civil war and a more international scene has developed in the city.<ref name="Dushanbe Encyc-2004i" />

=== Visual arts ===

Sculpture was first introduced to Dushanbe in the 1920s and throughout the Soviet period was focused on combining modern culture and a classical heritage. Modern sculpture mainly has historical subjects like [[Ferdowsi|Firdavsi]], [[Khosrow I|Shah Anushirvan]], or [[Ismail Samani]], often to commemorate Tajik nationhood and ethnicity by looking to past Achaemenid and Samanid figures.<ref name="Dushanbe Encyc-2004k">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65068362|title=Dushanbe : ėnt︠s︡iklopedii︠a︡|date=2004|publisher=Glavnai︠a︡ nauchnai︠a︡ redakt︠s︡ii︠a︡ Tadzhikskoĭ nat︠s︡ionalʹnoĭ ėnt︠s︡iklopedii|others=Dinorshoev, Muso.|isbn=5-89870-071-4|location=Dushanbe|chapter=Fine and Decorative Applied Arts|oclc=65068362|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028115236/http://dushanbe.tj/img/ENS.doc|archive-date=28 October 2010}}</ref><ref name="Hughes-2017" /><gallery mode="nolines" widths="170" heights="170" class="center" caption="Statues in Dushanbe">

</gallery>Painting in Dushanbe took off when Russian painters moved to this city in the 20s and 30s. By the 50s, Tajik artists started to paint. In the 1960s, the severe style <small>[<nowiki/>[[:ru:Суровый стиль|ru]]]</small> grew and in the 70s and 80s a focus on [[History of Tajikistan|Tajik heritage]] and [[nationalism]] was predominant. In the late 80s, however, painting shifted from a focus on historical figures to emotional depth and personality. During the civil war, a theme of conflict in painting developed.<ref name="Dushanbe Encyc-2004k" /> Sabzali Sharipov's black and white series, for example, was devoted to the civil war.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ulugova|first=Lola|date=January 2020|title=Tajik Artists Lead Social Change: The Role of Art in Questioning Tajik Traditional Values|url=https://centralasiaprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CAP-Paper-227-Lola-Ulugova.pdf}}</ref>

[[File:Кинотеатри Ватан.jpg|thumb|Movie theater]]
Cinema in Dushanbe started in the 1930s with the creation of film studios and cinemas by the Soviet government, although the first cinema was created in 1927 where residents watched Nibelung by [[Fritz Lang|Frits Lang]]. [[Kamil Yarmatov|Komil Yarmatov]] was the first prominent Tajik film director. Documentaries were also popular in this period, and the first feature film appeared in 1938. In World War 2, [[feature film]] production in Dushanbe was suspended due to lack of supplies. After the war, more feature films were developed, with many movies attempting to create a portrait of the city. In the 1980s a new generation of filmmakers brought new values such a pluralism into the theater, which led to some films focusing on the truth of Soviet history. During the civil war, the landscape changed dramatically. [[Tajikfilm]], which formerly had a monopoly on filmmaking, had to shut down, while independent filmmakers chronicled the horrors of the civil war.<ref name="Dushanbe Encyc-2004l" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=M.|first=Davidzon|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/11399951|title=Dushanbe, a guide|date=1983|publisher=Raduga|page=30|oclc=11399951}}</ref>

=== Newspapers and magazines ===
[[File:شماره یکم بخارای شریف.jpg|thumb|The front page of the first issue of ''Bukhara Sharif'' newspaper]]
The first newspaper published in Tajik was [[Bukharai-ye-sharif|''Bukhara Sharif'']] in [[Kagan, Uzbekistan|Kagan]] on 11 March 1912 and published by leaders of the [[Jadid Movement|Jadid movement]] like Mirzo Jalol Yusufzoda. The purpose of the newspaper was to "be a scientific, literary, directional, subject, and economic publication that will strive for the spread of civilization and the idea." Soon after, however, [[Ivan Yefimovich Petrov|Ivan Petrov]] requested that the Emir of Bukhara close the paper, which he did on 2 January 1913.<ref name="Mulloev-2009">{{Cite book|last=Mulloev|first=Sharif|url=https://mulloevsharif.wordpress.com/%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B9-%D0%B6%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8/|title=История таджикской журналистики: учебно-методическое пособие для студентов отделения журналистики.|publisher=Russian-Tajik (Slavic) University - Department of History and Theory of Journalism and Electronic Media|year=2009|editor-last=Usmonov|location=Dushanbe|trans-title=History of Tajik journalism: a textbook for students of journalism.|editor-last2=Chigrin}}</ref>

Oina and Mullo Nasreddin were two of the earliest Tajik language magazines. The ''Zvezda Vostok'' magazine was published in Tajik in the early 1920s in support of the October Revolution. The first Soviet newspaper distributed in Tajikistan was ''Shulai Inkilob'' (Flame of the Revolution) as propaganda for the Soviet government in 1919. It was distributed throughout Tajikistan and was the main Tajik language newspaper that opposed the previous Emirate and was clearly in support of communism, the [[October Revolution]], and the [[Communist Party of Bukhara|Bukharan Communist Party]].<ref name="Mulloev-2009" />

The first Soviet newspaper published in Tajikistan was ''{{transl|ru|Po basmachi}}'' which detailed the conditions of the Red Army in Tajikistan in 1923 during the [[Basmachi movement]]. In 1924, the newspaper ''Voice of the East'' ({{langx|ru|Овози шарк}} or {{lang|ru|Голос Востока}}), the first Soviet government newspaper was published in Dushanbe and was a forum for much of the poetry and literature of the young republic. In 1925, the official newspaper of Soviet Tajikistan was "''{{transl|tg|Bedorii tochik}}''" (Awakening of the Tajiks). An Uzbek-language paper, Red Tajikistan, was published in Tajikistan as well. [[Sadriddin Ayni]] also published many newspapers such as ''Bukhara News'', ''Horpustak'', and ''Flame of the Revolution''.<ref name="Mulloev-2009" />

In 1929, the newspaper Red Tajikistan came into print with a large daily circulation of 5000. In the 1930s ''Komsomolets Tadzhikistana'' was published as a communist paper intended for the youth of Tajikistan. Many other newspapers were published during this time as well. The press often emphasized the collective farming system and the newspaper ''Dehkoni Kambagal'' was popular among farmers.<ref name="Mulloev-2009" />

During World War 2 newspaper production was strained as raw materials became increasingly scarce and their numbers were reduced. After the war, the many newspapers from the 30s began to be produced once again. In the 60s and 70s the newspaper ''Communist of Tajikistan'' gained prominence, winning the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour|Order of the Red Banner of Labor]]. International cooperation was to be emphasized during the time period.<ref name="Mulloev-2009" />

During [[perestroika]], newspapers embraced more liberal and democratic ideas. One of the first to do this was the Komsomol of Tajikistan. Farkhang, a new literary magazine, published national Tajik and Islamic literature banned before such as the ''[[Masnavi]]''. The ''Sukhan'' newspaper, published by the Union of Journalists of Tajikistan, was a leading voice for liberalism and perestroika in the republic, writing about topics such as freedom of speech, democratization, and the opposition. The first publication not released by the state was from [[Rastokhez]], printed in Lithuania and delivered to Dushanbe. The [[Democratic Party (Tajikistan)|Democratic Party of Tajikistan]] published a paper, ''Justice'', in Dushanbe as well which had a circulation of 25000. ''Charogi Ruz'', or Light of Day, was the first private publication in Dushanbe, and advertised itself as the free tribune for youth. Free publications such as ''Oinai zindagi'' (by trade unions), ''Somon'', ''Haftgandzh'', and others formed.<ref name="Mulloev-2009" /> Today, ''Charogi Ruz'' is known for its criticism of the ruling government.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2012-01-13|title=In Russia, unknown attacker stabs exiled Tajik journalist|url=https://cpj.org/2012/01/in-russia-unknown-attacker-stabs-exiled-tajik-jour/|access-date=2020-08-17|website=Committee to Protect Journalists}}</ref>

In August 1999 there were officially 199 newspapers, although only 17 of those appeared regularly. Some of the most widely circulated national government publications are ''Dzhumhuriet'' and ''Narodna Gazeta''. In addition to the state news agency ''[[Khovar]]'' (News), there are several private newspapers, including [[Asia-Plus]], which regularly publishes in Russian and English and reports on political, social and economic issues, ''[[Jumhuriyat]],'' and ''[[Khalk ovozi]].<ref name="ewy">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gP_-8rXzQs8C&pg=PA4091|title=The Europa World Year: Kazakhstan - Zimbabwe|publisher=Taylor & Francis Group|year=2004|isbn=978-1-85743-255-8|page=4091|access-date=10 May 2016}}</ref>''<ref name="HRW-1999">{{Cite journal|title=An Overview of the Media in Tajikistan|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/tajikistan/Tajik99n-04.htm|journal=[[Human Rights Watch]]|volume=11|issue=November 1999}}</ref> In 2019 there were 37 regular newspapers and 37 magazines published in the city.<ref name="Dushanbe-2021a" />

=== Radio ===
In 1924 a radio station was built in Dushanbe for military communication. On 10 April 1930 the first radio broadcast was heard by civilians in Tajikistan, from Moscow. It functioned as a news source and a source of Soviet propaganda. The first station, in Dushanbe, mainly focused on retransmitted broadcasts from Moscow and radios gradually became more prevalent in the country. While development slowed during World War 2, afterwards Tajikistan received higher [[broadband]] and quality radio stations and broadcasts.<ref name="Mulloev-2009" />

In 1977, locally created radio broadcasts were able to be transmitted from Dushanbe thanks to the construction of the Radio House in the city. In 2000, the Sadoi Dushanbe Radio was created, and today that is one of the four programs broadcast in Dushanbe.<ref name="Mulloev-2009" />

As of August 1999 government radio is broadcast throughout the nation along with independent outlets such as Asia Plus radio.<ref name="Dushanbe Encyc-2004g" /> [[Radio Liberty]], the [[BBC]], and Sadoi Khuroson are also broadcast in Tajik, although no independent radio stations were in operation.<ref name="HRW-1999" />

=== Television ===
On 7 November 1959 the first television center was created in the republic, the [[Televizioni Tojikiston|Tajik Television Studio]]. In 1967 programs from Moscow and Tashkent were broadcast in the country and on 15 November 1975 color television was introduced.<ref name="Mulloev-2009" /> As of August 1999 12 to 15 stations broadcast consistently. Many Russian language channels like ORT, RTR, and TV-6 broadcast as well.<ref name="HRW-1999" /> Today, a greater number of private television stations operate in the city,<ref name="Dushanbe Encyc-2004g" /> with 15 in the whole country, although there are still 7 state owned channels.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019|title=Media Sustainability Index: Tajikistan|url=https://www.irex.org/sites/default/files/pdf/media-sustainability-index-europe-eurasia-2019-tajikistan.pdf|publisher=[[International Research & Exchanges Board]]}}</ref>

{{div col end}}In 1982, Mary Hey and Sophia Stoller started an initiative to make Dushanbe a sister city of [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] even though during that time they were on opposite sides of the [[Cold War]].
