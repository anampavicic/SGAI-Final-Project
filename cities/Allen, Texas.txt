==Transportation==
Allen is served directly by several major roadways and freeways. Allen is bisected by U.S. Highway 75 and bordered to the west by Texas State Highway 121. Some of the major roadways in Allen are: Stacy Road, Exchange Parkway, McDermott Drive, Main Street, Alma Drive, Greenville Avenue, Ridgeview Drive, Allen Heights Drive, Angel Parkway, and Bethany Drive. Currently, with the large increase in its population and its ongoing retail and business development, traffic has become congested.

As of 2023, Allen is not served by any public transit agencies.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2023/09/25/would-collin-county-dfw-growth-support-a-rail-regional-transportation/ |website=[[Dallas Morning News]] |title=Would Collin County, D-FW growth support a regional transit system? |last=McFarland |first=Susan |date=25 September 2023 |archive-date=5 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240105220144/https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2023/09/25/would-collin-county-dfw-growth-support-a-rail-regional-transportation/}}</ref> The [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]] (DART) public transit system does not extend north into Allen. Active [[Red Line (DART)|Red Line]] service is unable to expand further north because Allen is currently unable to levy the 1% sales tax required for DART membership. Allen levies sales tax at the maximum rate of 8.25% set by Texas law. Redirecting 1% sales tax for DART membership would require scrapping funding for the Allen Economic Development Corporation and the Allen Community Development Corporation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cityofallen.org/1486/Public-Transit |title=Public Transit |publisher=Allen, Texas |access-date=9 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240409184745/https://www.cityofallen.org/1486/Public-Transit |archive-date=9 April 2024}}</ref> The [[Texoma Area Paratransit System]] (TAPS) transit service provided bus routes for a short period from 2013 until Collin County bus service was suspended in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://tapsbus.com/wp-content/uploads/allen-routes-online1.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220104142528/https://tapsbus.com/wp-content/uploads/allen-routes-online1.pdf |archive-date=4 January 2022 |title=Allen Texas Route Map |publisher=[[Texoma Area Paratransit System]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/taps-suspends-bus-service-in-collin-county-indefinitely/2008510/ |title=TAPS Suspends Bus Service in Collin County Indefinitely |website=[[NBC DFW]] |date=14 November 2015 |archive-date=21 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210621112312/https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/taps-suspends-bus-service-in-collin-county-indefinitely/2008510/}}</ref>
