'''Ismailia''' ({{langx|ar|الإسماعيلية}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-Ismāʻīlīyah}}'', {{IPA|arz|lesmæʕiˈlejjæ|lang}}) is a city in north-eastern [[Egypt]]. Situated on the west bank of the [[Suez Canal]], it is the capital of the [[Ismailia Governorate]]. The city had an estimated population of about 1,430,000 in 2024 (about 750,000, if including surrounding rural areas). It is located approximately halfway between [[Port Said]] to the north and [[Suez]] to the south. The Canal widens at that point to include [[Lake Timsah]], one of the [[Bitter Lakes]] linked by the Canal.

== History ==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Zoetwaterkanaal te Ismailia met Hollandse ophaalbrug. TMnr 60002282.jpg|thumb|left|Ismaïlia, ca. 1870]]

[[File:ISMAILIA - Office of the Suez Canal Co.png|thumb|left|Postcard of the Suez Canal Company]]
Ismailia was founded in 1863, during the construction of the [[Suez Canal]], by Khedive [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail]], after whom the city is named. Following the [[Battle of Kafr-el-Dawwar]] in 1882 the British established a base there.

The head office of the [[Suez Canal Authority]] is located in Ismailia at the shore of Lake Timsah. It has a large number of buildings dating from British and French involvement with the Canal. Most of these buildings are currently used by Canal employees and officials.

During [[World War I]] the British had an air base there and the [[Battle of Romani]] took place nearby. Ismailia War Cemetery was designed in 1919 by Sir [[Robert Lorimer]] marking the casualties of the battle.<ref>Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer</ref>

In 1973 the [[Battle of Ismailia]] took place in the city.

In October 2023, a massive fire broke out in the security directorate of the city, leaving the building fully burned with 38 injured and 1 dead.<ref>{{Cite web |last=National |first=The |date=2023-10-02 |title=One dead and dozens injured as fire engulfs police complex in Egypt's Ismailia |url=https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/egypt/2023/10/02/huge-fire-erupts-at-police-facility-in-egypts-ismailia/ |access-date=2023-10-04 |website=The National |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-10-03 |title=Fire engulfs Ismailia Security Directorate, dozens injured - Dailynewsegypt |url=https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2023/10/03/fire-engulfs-ismailia-security-directorate-dozens-injured/ |access-date=2023-10-04 |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Government and politics===
The [[History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt|Muslim Brotherhood]] was founded in Ismailia by [[Hassan al-Banna]] in March 1928. An underground paramilitary wing was established in the 1940s, primarily to contest the [[History of Egypt under the British|British occupation of Egypt]]. In the early 1950s, Ismailia hosted the British Military HQ and the Civilian Administration Centre of the Canal Zone. An attack on an Egyptian government building and army barracks manned by [[auxiliary police]]men by a British Army force on 25 January 1952 was a key event leading to the overthrow of King [[Farouk I]] later that year and the Egyptian Revolution that followed. British forces pulled out of Ismailia in 1954.

== Eparchy ==
On 17 December 1982 an Eparchy ([[Eastern Catholic]] Diocese) of Ismayliah was established on territory split off from the [[Coptic Catholic Patriarchate of Alexandria]] ([[Alexandrian Rite]] in [[Coptic language]]), which remains its [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]]. Its episcopal see is St. Mark's cathedral.

== Education ==
Ismailia has several public and private schools. Ismailia is the home of the [[Suez Canal University]], established in 1976 with the help of the Chinese Government to serve the region of Suez Canal and Sinai. Suez Canal University now is one of the fastest growing educational institutions in Egypt with many students studying abroad.

== Culture and recreation ==

=== Arts and festivals ===
[[File:Virgin Mary Church.jpg|thumbnail|right|Virgin Mary Church known as "Guardian of the Canal", is one of many examples of French architecture in Ismailia]]
Ismailia hosts two important festivals each year. The first is the International Film Festival for Documentaries and Shorts that is held in June.<ref>{{cite web|title= Ismailia Film Festival 21st version (2019)edition to be from 10 April to 16 April 2019|url=http://www.ismailiafilmfest.com/|website=Ismailia Film Festival|access-date=4 August 2014}}</ref> In June 2014, the 17th consecutive festival was organized. The second is the Ismailia International Folklore Arts Festival that is held in September. In this festival folkloric troupes from all around the globe meet in Ismailia, where they perform folkloric dances representing the culture of their countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sis.gov.eg/Story/116352/Ismailia?lang=en-us|title=Ismailia|website=Egypt State Information Service|access-date=27 August 2017}}</ref>

=== Tourism ===
[[File:Fernidan de Lesseps house Ismailia.JPG|thumb|[[Ferdinand de Lesseps]]' house and office in Ismailia, near the Suez Canal]]
Ismailia does get tourists from within Egypt, but is not a major tourism destination for international tourists. The city is approximately a ninety-minute automobile drive from [[Cairo]]. From Ismailia it is approximately a four-hour drive to [[Sharm el-Sheikh]] in South [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]]. Driving to the [[Taba Border Crossing]] at [[Taba (Egypt)|Taba]] and the [[Rafah Border Crossing]] at [[Rafah]] are both approximately four-hour drives. A major attraction is the Ismailia Museum which was built in 1932. Visitors will find a variety of significant archaeological finds especially from sites in the Ismailia governorate such as Tell el-Maskhuta, from North Sinai, and from Upper Egypt.

=== Sports ===
[[File:Ismailia Stadium.jpg|thumb|[[Ismailia Stadium]]]]
Ismailia is home to the third most successful club in Egypt (in the field of Football, [[Ismaily SC]]. The club's performance is considered a major political issue, and can tend to dictate the city's mood. The team enjoys brief stints of competition for local and international competition, but its financial situation prevents these stints from extending beyond a few years. The team has won the [[Egyptian Premier League|Egyptian League]] three times (1967, 1991, 2002), the [[Egyptian Soccer Cup|Egyptian Cup]] twice (1997, 2000), and the [[CAF Champions League|African Cup of Champions Clubs]] once in 1969 as the first Egyptian and Arab Club team to have won this league.

== Climate ==
[[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies its climate as [[hot desert climate|hot desert]] (BWh).

The hottest recorded temperature was {{convert|47|°C}} on 14 June 1944 while the coldest recorded temperature was {{convert|0.2|°C}} in January.<ref name="Voodoo Skies">{{cite web | url =http://voodooskies.com/weather/egypt/ismailia | title =Ismailia, Egypt | access-date =5 July 2013 | publisher =Voodoo Skies | archive-date =18 March 2015 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150318123126/http://voodooskies.com/weather/egypt/ismailia | url-status =dead }}</ref>
