'''Hurghada''' ({{IPAc-en|h|ər|ˈ|ɡ|æ|d|ə|,_|-|ˈ|ɡ|ɑː|-}}; {{langx|ar|الغردقة}} ''{{transliteration|ar|al-Ġhardaqah}}'', {{IPA|arz|el ɣæɾˈdæʔæ}}) is a coastal [[list of cities in Egypt|city]] that serves as the largest city and capital of the [[Red Sea Governorate]] of [[Egypt]]. Hurghada has grown from a small fishing village to one of the largest resort destinations along the Red Sea coast, stretching close to 40&nbsp;km.

== Etymology ==
The city's name is derived from the Arabic name of the [[Nitraria]] plant ({{Langx|ar|غردق|translit=ghardaq}}). The English ''Hurghada'' comes from ''gharqad (''{{Langx|ar|غرقد}}), a variant of the same name.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History Of Hurghada {{!}} Get To Know How The Story Began ! |url=https://travel2egypt.org/egypt-travel-guide/hurghada/introducing-hurghada/history/ |access-date=2023-02-13 |language=en}}</ref> The tree is mentioned in a [[hadith]], where it is called the "tree of the Jews".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sahih Muslim 2922 - The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour - كتاب الفتن وأشراط الساعة - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) |url=https://sunnah.com/muslim:2922 |access-date=2023-02-13 |website=sunnah.com}}</ref>

== Overview ==
[[File:Nieuwe jachthaven Hurghada - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|Street in Marina Hurghada]]
Hurghada was founded in the early 20th century. For many decades it was a small fishing village, but it has grown into a major Red Sea resort as a result of Egyptian and foreign investment that began in the 1980s. Holiday resorts and hotels provide facilities for [[windsurfing]], [[kitesurfing]], [[yachting]], [[scuba diving]] and [[snorkeling]]. The city is known for its [[watersports]], nightlife and warm weather. Daytime temperatures are around {{convert|35|°C|°F}} most of the year, and during July and August temperatures can reach over {{convert|46|°C|°F}}.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}} Hurghada is a popular holiday destination for Europeans, especially during the winter, and some spend Christmas and New Year there.

Hurghada extends for about {{convert|36|km|mi|0}} along the coast, but does not reach far into the surrounding desert. The resort is a destination for Egyptian tourists from [[Cairo]], the Delta and [[Upper Egypt]], as well as [[package holiday]] tourists from Europe.

Many of Hurghada's newer hotels, restaurants, and shops are located along El Mamsha. Most of the largest hotel resorts are located in the area between Mamsha and Sahl Hasheesh on El Mamsha. Beyond Sahl Hasheesh there are the hotels of Makadi Bay. Dahar is the oldest part of the town, where the traditional [[bazaar]], [[post office]] and long-distance bus stations (Go Bus and Upper Egypt Bus) are situated. The busiest area is Sakala, the city center on Sheraton Road lined with hotels, shops and restaurants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lifebeyondex.com/post/the-city-of-hurghada/|title=The main areas in Hurghada|date=7 June 2019|website=Lifebeyondex|access-date=28 September 2021|archive-date=14 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414051224/https://www.lifebeyondex.com/post/the-city-of-hurghada/|url-status=live}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=May 2023}}

==Transport==
The city is served by the [[Hurghada International Airport]] with scheduled passenger traffic connecting to [[Cairo]] and directly to several cities in [[Europe]].

== History ==

The Egyptian Red Sea coast has been inhabited since antiquity, with the  area of Hurghada being occupied since the [[4th century]], when the ancient settlement of Abu Sha’ar ({{Langx|ar|ابو شعر}}), located 20&nbsp;km north of the modern city, was established. Originally founded as a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] military fort for Ala Nova Maximiana unit between [[309]]-[[AD 311|311]], it was transformed into a [[Christianity|Christian]] community around [[400]]. The Christians repurposed the fort into a church, leaving behind inscriptions, graffiti, and artifacts such as a 5th-century papyrus and a tapestry with a cross. The settlement declined after either the [[Sasanian conquest of Egypt|Sasanian]] or [[Arab conquest of Egypt]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Jørgensen |first=Lise Bender |title=Textiles from a Late Roman/Byzantine ecclesiastical centre at Abu Sha’ar, Egypt |url=https://www.academia.edu/47422726/Textiles_from_a_Late_Roman_Byzantine_ecclesiastical_centre_at_Abu_Sha_ar_Egypt |journal=Zea Books}}</ref>

The modern city Hurghada was established in 1905 as a fishing village. Oil was discovered in the area in 1913, and in 1921 British oil companies began its production and export. During the reign of [[King Farouk]] a recreational center was built in the city, but after President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]]'s nationalization of Egypt's industries it was reallocated to the [[Egyptian Armed Forces]].{{citation needed|date=May 2023}}

During the [[War of Attrition]] between Israel and Egypt (1967–70), [[Shadwan Island]] in the Red Sea to the east of the city was fortified by Egyptian troops and used as a radar post. On 22 January 1970 the island was the site of [[Operation Rhodes]], a helicopter assault by Israeli troops who occupied it for 36 hours.{{citation needed|date=May 2023}}

During the [[Yom Kippur War|October War of 1973]], Hurghada harbor was the target of {{interlanguage link|Magavit operations|lt=four Israeli operations|he|מבצעי מגבית}}.{{citation needed|date=May 2023}}

In September 1994, [[Drive-by shooting|drive-by shooters]] killed two Egyptians and a German tourist; another German man was wounded in the attack and died of his injuries after returning to Germany.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1994/09/28/German-Egyptians-killed-by-militants/8047780724800/|title=German, Egyptians killed by militants|agency=UPI|first=Bahaa|last=Elkoussy|date=28 September 1994}}</ref>

Hurghada's major industry is foreign and domestic tourism thanks to its year-round hot and dry climate and long beaches. Its waters are clear and calm for most of the year, making Hurghada a popular destination for [[underwater diving]] and snorkelling.

[[Sahl Hasheesh]] is a newly developed resort located {{convert|18|km|mi}} south of Hurghada on the Red Sea.<ref>{{cite web|title=Famous Cities: Sahl Hasheesh|url=http://www.sis.gov.eg/section/415/456?lang=en-us|website=State Information Service|publisher=Government of Egypt|access-date=30 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105223542/http://www.sis.gov.eg/section/415/456?lang=en-us|archive-date=5 November 2016}}</ref> It has clear long descending seas and is home to diverse marine life around artificial underwater walls.

=== El Qoseir ===
[[El Qoseir]] is one of the Egyptian gateways, and one of the oldest cities on the western coast of the Red Sea. In the past it was known by various names, such as ''Thagho'' in the pharonic period, ''Leucos Limen'' (white port in [[Greek language|Greek]]) in the Hellenistic and Ptolemaic period, and ''Portus Albus'' in the Roman period. In the Islamic period it was given the name ''El Qoseir'', which means "a small palace or fortress".

Located between Hurghada and Marsa Alam, El Qoseir used to be an important port. Many people traveled from there to the [[Land of Punt]] to buy ivory, leather and incense. During the Ottoman  and the Islamic periods, Egyptians and Muslims from North Africa traveled from El Qoseir as pilgrims to Mecca. It was also the only port importing coffee from [[Yemen]]. During the French occupation of Egypt, El Qoseir was the arrival point for Arabs and Muslims from [[Hejaz]] coming to fight beside the [[Mamluk]] against the French army. The most important sites in El Qoseir are the fort and the water reservoir. The water reservoir was El Qoseir's only source of drinking water 100 years ago.

El Qoseir El Adima, the city's historic area, was once a Roman port and hundreds of [[amphora]] and old [[pottery]] artefacts have been found there. There are several 300-year-old buildings in the area, including an Ottoman fort and a number of historic mosques: El Farran, El Qenawi and El Senousi. The police station is also located at a historic site. The area contains bazaars, cafes, coffee shops and restaurants selling sea food.
