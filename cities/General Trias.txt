'''General Trias''' ({{IPA|tl|hɛnɛˈɾal ˈtɾias|}}), officially the '''City of General Trias'''<ref>{{Cite web |title=History « Official Website of General Trias :: Province of Cavite |url=https://www.generaltrias.gov.ph/about-general-trias/history/ |access-date=2022-11-07}}</ref> ({{lang-fil|Lungsod ng General Trias}}), formerly known as '''San Francisco de Malabon''' is a 1st class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Cavite]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 450,583 people.{{PH census|current}}

==Etymology==
During the earlier part of the Spanish colonial period, General Trias was often referred to as ''Las Estancias'' (the ranches), which was once a part of Cavite el Viejo, the present-day [[Kawit]]. It was also called ''Malabón Grande''. The name ''Malabón'' is derived from Tagalog, meaning "having many [[silt deposit]]s".<ref name="Lesho">{{cite book |last1=Lesho |first1=Marivic |last2=Sippola |first2=Eeva |title=Vergleichende Kolonialtoponomastik Strukturen und Funktionen kolonialer Ortsbenennung |date=2018 |publisher=De Gruyter |chapter=Toponyms in Manila and Cavite, Philippines |isbn=9783110608618 |pages=317–332}}</ref>

The first reference seems to be more probable because [[Mariano Trías|General Mariano Trías]], a noted writer, adopted the nom de guerre "''Labong'' Grande, on the other hand, was affixed to the appellation because at the time, the place was a vast wilderness covering Sitio Tejero, frequently called by the revolutionary as Salinas (present-day Rosario), Santa Cruz de Malabon or Malabon el Chico (present-day [[Tanza]]) and Tierra Alta (present-day [[Noveleta]]). When the town was made independent from Cavite el Viejo, it was finally called by its popular name San Francisco de Malabon, in honor of patron saint, [[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis of Assisi]].

==History==

===First Cry of Cavite===
The first uprising in Cavite known as the "First Cry of Cavite" occurred in San Francisco de Malabon<ref name="firstcry">{{cite news|url=http://ph.news.yahoo.com/cavite-town-marks-262nd-anniversary.html|title=Cavite town marks 262nd anniversary - Yahoo! News Philippines|work=[[Yahoo!]]|access-date=July 2, 2013}}</ref> about ten o’clock in the morning of August 31, 1896, when the town tribunal was attacked by Filipino revolutionaries led by [[Mariano Trías]], Diego Mojica and Nicolas Portilla in Pasong Kalabaw (now known as Santa Clara).<ref name="legend">{{cite web|url=http://harrybalais.com/travels/heritage-town-general-trias-cavite/|title=Heritage Town: General Trias, Cavite|date=February 11, 2013|work=LegendHarry|access-date=August 23, 2014}}</ref> The second incident followed at twelve noon at Tierra Alta and the third in Cavite el Viejo between two and three o’clock in the afternoon.

===Tejeros Convention===
A town chapter of the [[Katipunan]] known as Balangay Mapagtiis had already been in existence in the place for sometime. The Sangguniang Bayang Magdiwang headed by Gen. [[Mariano Álvarez]] of Tierra Alta and the Sangguniang Bayang Mapagtiis of San Francisco de Malabon later merged under the name Magdiwang Council with Álvarez as president. The Magdiwang Council hosted the [[Tejeros Convention]] on March 22, 1897, in a friar estate house in Sitio Tejero (now part of Rosario) wherein Gen. [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] was elected president and Mariano Trías, then lieutenant general, as vice-president in a revolutionary government replacing the Katipunan.

===American occupation===
On October 15, 1903, Act No. 947 was approved by the [[Taft Commission|Philippine Commission]], merging the adjacent town of Santa Cruz de Malabon (present-day [[Tanza]]) with San Francisco de Malabon, with the latter designated as the municipal seat.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=947|title=An Act Reducing the Twenty-Three Municipalities of the Province of Cavite to Eleven|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%20947|date=October 15, 1903|accessdate=June 17, 2023}}</ref> In 1909, a resolution was passed by the San Francisco de Malabon municipal council to separate Santa Cruz de Malabon to become an independent municipality of its own; it took effect in 1910.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tanza.gov.ph/history|title=History|website=Tanza|accessdate=June 17, 2023}}</ref>

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
On August 19, 2015, [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Benigno Aquino III]] signed Republic Act No. 10675 which converted the municipality of General Trias into a [[Philippine city|component city]] of [[Cavite]].<ref name="RA10675">{{cite PH act|title=An Act Converting the Municipality of General Trias in the Province of Cavite Into a Component City to Be Known as the City of General Trias|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2015/08/19/republic-act-no-10675/|chamber=RA|number=10675|website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|date=August 19, 2015}}</ref> The bill finally came into full effect after majority of the city's residents voted yes to cityhood through a plebiscite.<ref name="rappler-cityhood-yes">{{cite news|title=General Trias in Cavite now a city|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/115860-cavite-general-trias-cityhood-plebiscite|access-date=December 13, 2015|work=Rappler|date=December 13, 2015}}</ref> General Trias thus became the seventh city in the province and the 145th in the country.

===Lone District of General Trias===
On September 14, 2018, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] signed ''Republic Act No. 11069'',<ref name="ra11069">{{cite PH act|chamber=RA|number=11069|title=Amending Section 1 of Republic Act No. 9727, Reapportioning the province of Cavite into eight (8) legislative districts|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2018/09/14/republic-act-no-11069 |website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|date=July 23, 2018}}</ref> reapportioning the province of Cavite into eight legislative districts to make General Trias the province's sixth legislative district.

==Geography==
General Trias is an inland city of [[Cavite]] located {{convert|33|km}} southwest of [[Manila]] and {{convert|23|km}} from [[Imus]]. It straddles the northeastern part of the province. The city is surrounded by the municipalities of [[Rosario, Cavite|Rosario]] and [[Noveleta]] in the north, by [[Tanza]] and [[Trece Martires]] in the west, by [[Amadeo, Cavite|Amadeo]] in the south, [[Silang, Cavite|Silang]] in the southeast, and the cities of [[Dasmariñas]] and [[Imus]] to the east.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cavite.gov.ph/home/index.php/cities-and-municipalities/district-vi/general-trias |title=Geography: Municipality of General Trias |publisher=The Official Website of the Provincial Government of Cavite |location=Trece Martires City |access-date=October 6, 2015}}</ref> General Trias has a total land area of {{convert|81.46|sqkm|sp=us}}.{{PSGC detail|area}}

===Climate=== 
Unlike the tropical weather of its lowlands and lower highlands, the upland villages of Panungyanan and Javalera enjoy tropical highland weather due to their nearness to Tagaytay and Amadeo, which is south of the city.
