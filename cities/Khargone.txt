==History==
According to mythology, the name "Nimar" was derived from the word "Nimarya" (निमार्य), which signifies that the land had belonged to both the Aryas and the non-Arya. However, according to another myth, the word "Nimar" has been associated with the place due to the presence of many Neem trees.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://khargone.nic.in/About%20Khargone.htm |title=परिचय: जिला खरगौन (म.प्र.) भारत 451001 }}</ref>

After the formation of the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]] on 1 November 1956, the district came into existence as West Nimar (पश्चिम निमाड़).

The population of the district was estimated to be about 1,872,413, according to the census of India 2011.

==Climate==
Khargone has a transitional climate between a [[tropical]] wet and dry climate and a humid [[subtropical]] climate. Three distinct seasons are observed: summer, monsoon and winter.
Summers are extremely hot and dry in this region, lasting from mid-march to mid-June followed by the monsoon season. The temperatures in summer are usually above {{convert|40|°C|F|0}} during April–May. During these months when temperatures become very high, the dry and hot wind (locally known as "loo") blows in this area, widely affecting the local ecology. The temperature also remains quite high during the night.

The [[monsoon]] arrives in late June, with temperatures around {{convert|29|°C|F|0}} and about {{convert|36|in|mm|0}} rainfall. The rainy season is humid and has substantial rainfall. Local people are commonly affected by the flooding of river Kunda, which flows from the outskirts of the city.
Winters start in mid-November and are dry, mild and sunny. Temperatures average about 4–15&nbsp;°C {{nowrap|(39–59 °F)}}, but can fall close to freezing on some nights.
