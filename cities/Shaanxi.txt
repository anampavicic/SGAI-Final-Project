'''Shaanxi'''{{efn|alternatively '''Shensi''', see [[#Name|§ Name]]}} is an inland [[Provinces of China|province]] in [[Northwestern China]]. It borders the province-level divisions of [[Inner Mongolia]] to the north, [[Shanxi]] and [[Henan]] to the east, [[Hubei]], [[Chongqing]], and [[Sichuan]] to the south, and [[Gansu]] and [[Ningxia]] to the west. Shaanxi covers an area of over {{convert|205000|sqkm|sp=us|abbr=on|0}} with about 37 million people, the 16th largest in China. [[Xi'an]] – which includes the sites of the former [[Capitals of China|Chinese capitals]] [[Fenghao]] and [[Chang'an]] – is the [[Xi'an|provincial capital]] as well as the largest city in Northwest China<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.elivecity.cn/html/yijuyanjiu/yijuyanjiu1/645.html|script-title=zh:最新中国城市人口数量排名（根据2010年第六次人口普查）|website=www.elivecity.cn |language=zh-cn |access-date=2019-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303135707/http://www.elivecity.cn/html/yijuyanjiu/yijuyanjiu1/645.html|archive-date=2015-03-03|url-status=live}}</ref> and also one of the [[oldest cities in China]] and the oldest of the [[Historical capitals of China|Four Great Ancient Capitals]], being the capital for the [[Western Zhou]], [[Western Han]], [[Sima Jin|Jin]], [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] [[List of Chinese dynasties|dynasties]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572407/Xi%E2%80%99an.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228105855/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572407/Xi%E2%80%99an.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-02-28|title=Xi'an – MSN Encarta|date=2008-02-28|access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref> [[Xianyang]], which served as the [[Qin dynasty]] capital, is just north across Wei River.  The other [[Prefectures of China|prefecture]]-level [[prefecture-level city|cities]] into which the province is divided are [[Ankang]], [[Baoji]], [[Hanzhong]], [[Shangluo]], [[Tongchuan]], [[Weinan]], [[Yan'an]] and [[Yulin, Shaanxi|Yulin]].

The province is geographically divided into three parts, namely [[Northern Shaanxi|Northern]], [[Guanzhong|Central]] and [[Southern Shaanxi]]. Northern Shaanxi (or "[[Shaanbei]]") makes up the southeastern portion of the [[Ordos Basin]] and mainly comprises the two prefectural cities of [[Yulin, Shaanxi|Yulin]] and [[Yan'an]] on the northern [[Loess Plateau]], demarcated from the [[Ordos Desert]] and the grasslands of [[Inner Mongolia]]'s [[Ordos City]] by the [[Ming Great Wall]].  Central Shaanxi (or "Shaanzhong") is also known as the [[Guanzhong]] region and comprises the [[drainage basin]] of lower [[Wei River]] east of [[Mount Liupan|Mount Long]] and north of the [[Qinling Mountains]], where the majority of Shaanxi's population reside. Southern Shaanxi (or "[[Shaannan]]") comprises the three prefectural cities in the edge of the [[historical region|historical]] Bashu region south of the Qinling Mountains and includes the three mountainous cities of [[Hanzhong]], [[Ankang]] and [[Shangluo]].

The area comprising Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Henan formed the cradle of [[History of China|Chinese civilization]]. In the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republican era]] of China, the city of [[Yan'an]] was near the endpoint of the [[Long March]] by the [[Chinese Red Army]], who fled from [[Jiangxi]] after the [[Chinese Soviet Republic]] were destroyed by the [[Kuomintang]] armies, and became the birthplace of the [[Chinese Communist Revolution]] from late 1935 to early 1947 and the Communists formed the [[Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region]] in constituent parts of Shaanxi.

The vast majority of the population of Shaanxi is [[Han Chinese]], with [[Hui people|Hui]], [[Manchu]] and [[Mongol]] being the more significant [[ethnic minorities in China|ethnic minorities]]. [[Mandarin Chinese]] is the main [[spoken language]] in Shaanxi, including [[Central Plains Mandarin|Zhongyuan Mandarin]] and [[Southwestern Mandarin]] dialects; another [[variety of Chinese]], [[Jin Chinese]], is also spoken in the regions neighboring Shanxi.

Shaanxi is China's [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP|15th largest economy]], ranking within the middle tier among China's administrative divisions. The [[fossil fuel]] and [[high technology]] sectors compose the two largest industries in Shaanxi Province. The high technology sector includes [[aerospace manufacturer|aircraft and aerospace industries]] and Shaanxi produces more than 50% of the [[R&D]] and [[manufacturing]] equipment for the country's domestic [[commercial aviation]] industry.<ref name="thechinaperspective.com" />

Shaanxi is considered one of the cradles of Chinese civilization. Thirteen feudal dynasties established their capitals in the province during a span of more than 1,100 years, from the Zhou dynasty to the Tang dynasty.

The province's principal city and current capital, [[Xi'an]], is one of the [[Historical capitals of China|four great ancient capitals of China]] and is the eastern terminus of the [[Silk Road]], which leads to Europe, the Arabian Peninsula, and Africa.

The region was briefly governed as the [[Three Qins]] after the fall of the [[Qin dynasty]]. This is the origin of one of Shaanxi's two abbreviations, {{lang|zh|秦}} (''Qin''), the other being {{lang|zh|陝}} (''Shaan''). Then it was conquered by [[Liu Bang]] during the [[Chu-Han Contention]]. Under the Han dynasty, the [[Northern Silk Road]] was expanded to advance exploration and military purposes to the west. This Northern Silk Road is the northernmost of the [[Silk Road]]s and is about {{convert|2600|km|mi|sigfig=2}} in length. It connected the ancient Chinese capital of Xi'an to the west over the [[Wushao Ling Pass]] to [[Wuwei, Gansu|Wuwei]] and emerging in [[Kashgar]] before linking to ancient [[Parthia]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18006 |title=''Silk Road, North China'', C.Michael Hogan, the Megalithic Portal, ed.

The [[Xiongnu]]-led kingdom [[Northern Xia]] (407–431) set its capital in [[Tongwancheng]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Obrusanszky|first=Borbala |title=Tongwancheng, the city of Southern Huns|journal=Transoxiana|volume= 14|date= August 2009|url=https://www.academia.edu/1361886}}</ref>

The Northern [[Song dynasty]] and the [[Tangut people|Tangut]]-led [[Western Xia]] contested their border in Shaanxi. Western Xia found the Luōwùchéng (罗兀城) frontier fort in 1071 but was taken by Song in 1081.<ref>{{cite news|title=罗兀城：无定河边的千年守望|date=2017-11-24|work=陕西日报  |page=10|last=白亮|url=https://www.sohu.com/a/206752144_204488|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20230928144627/https://www.sohu.com/a/206752144_204488|archivedate=2023-09-28}}</ref>

Under the [[Ming dynasty]], Shaanxi was established with the founding of the Shaanxi Provincial Administration Commission in 1376, whose administration also included the modern provinces of [[Gansu]], [[Ningxia]], and part of [[Qinghai]].<ref name="Ben Cao Gang Mu"/> During this dynasty, most visitors from Central and West Asia entered the country via Shaanxi.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Chen |first=Yuan Julian |date=2021-10-11 |title=Between the Islamic and Chinese Universal Empires: The Ottoman Empire, Ming Dynasty, and Global Age of Explorations |url=https://www.academia.edu/59068575 |journal=Journal of Early Modern History |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=422–456 |doi=10.1163/15700658-bja10030 |s2cid=244587800 |issn=1385-3783 |access-date=24 March 2022 |archive-date=17 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220417192653/https://www.academia.edu/59068575 |url-status=live }}</ref>

One of the most devastating [[earthquakes]] in history occurred near [[Mount Hua|Hua Shan]] in southeastern Shaanxi on January 23, 1556, killing an estimated 830,000 people (see [[1556 Shaanxi earthquake]]).

The end of the short-lived [[Jiangxi Soviet]] signaled the beginning of the [[Long March]] by [[Mao Zedong]] and the [[Chinese Communists]] to the [[Shaanxi Soviet]] at Yan'an.

The administrative evolution of Shaanxi: The Northern Song established the Shaanxi Lu (circuit), governed from modern Xi'an in 997. The [[Yuan dynasty]] established [[Shaanxi Province (Yuan dynasty)]], governed by a [[Branch Secretariat]] in 1286.<ref name="Ben Cao Gang Mu">Dictionary of the Ben cao gang mu, Volume 2: Geographical and Administrative Designations First Edition, Paul Unschuld, Series Editor Edition by Hua Linfu (Author), Paul D. Buell (Author), Paul U. Unschuld (Editor)</ref> After the founding of the Qing dynasty, Gansu was split from Shaanxi, but both provinces were governed under the [[Viceroy of Shaan-Gan]].

===Prehistoric site===
The [[Lantian Man]] site, with hominin fossils from approximately one million years ago, was found in Lantian County in northwestern Shaanxi province, near the city of Xi'an. Scientists classify Lantian Man as a subspecies of ''[[Homo erectus]]''. The fossils are displayed at the [[Shaanxi History Museum]], Xi'an, China.

[[File:Yellow River bridge connecting Wubu and Liulin.jpg|thumb|The [[Yellow River]] is the natural provincial border between [[Wubu County|Wubu]], Shaanxi (right) and [[Liulin County|Liulin]], Shanxi (left), both being the heartland of [[Jin Chinese]] language. The [[Taiyuan–Zhongwei–Yinchuan railway]] ran across the bridge.]]

The geography of the area is described as being part of the [[Ordos Desert]] in the north along the border with Inner Mongolia, the [[Loess Plateau]] in the central part of the province, the [[Qin Mountains]] (Qinling) running east to west in the south central part, and subtropical climate south of the Qinling. In between the Loess Plateau and the Qinling lies the [[Wei River]] Valley, or [[Guanzhong]], a cradle of early Chinese civilization.

Going clockwise, Shaanxi borders [[Shanxi]] (E, NE), [[Henan]] (E), [[Hubei]] (SE), [[Chongqing]] (S), [[Sichuan]] (SW), [[Gansu]] (W), [[Ningxia]] (NW), and Inner Mongolia (N). In terms of number of bordering provincial-level divisions, Shaanxi ties Inner Mongolia.

Due to its large span in latitude, Shaanxi has a variety of climates. Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], the [[Shanbei|northern parts]], including the Loess Plateau, have either a [[Cold desert climate|cold arid]] (Köppen ''BWk'') or [[Cold semi-arid climate|cold semi-arid]] (Köppen ''BSk''), with cold and very dry winters, dry springs and autumns, and hot, humid summers. The area known as Guanzhong is mostly semi-arid, though there are a few areas with a [[humid subtropical climate]] (Köppen ''Cwa''), with cool to cold winters, and hot, humid summers that often see early-season heatwaves. The [[Shannan (region)|southern portion]] is much more humid and lies in the humid subtropical zone, with more temperate winters and long, hot, humid summers. Annual mean temperature is roughly between {{convert|8|and|16|°C|°F}}, with January temperatures ranging from {{convert|−11|to|3.5|°C|°F}} and July temperatures ranging from {{convert|21|to|28|°C|°F}}.

Besides the provincial capital of Xi'an, other cities include: [[Baoji]], [[Hanzhong]], [[Lintong]], [[Tongchuan]], [[Xianyang]], [[Yan'an]] and [[Ankang]].

The politics of Shaanxi is structured in a triple party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.

The [[Governor of Shaanxi]] is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Shaanxi. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor is considered to have less power than the Shaanxi [[Chinese Communist Party]] Provincial Committee Secretary ({{zh|labels=no|s=中共陕西省委书记}}), colloquially termed the "Shaanxi [[Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary|CCP Party Chief]]"; since the Governor is always ranked as the First-Deputy Secretary in the Shaanxi Chinese Communist Party Provincial Committee.

Shaanxi was established as a provincial government since [[Qing dynasty]]. On 10 January 1950, the People's Government of Shaanxi was established in [[Xi'an]]. Ma Minfang was then appointed as the first Governor of Shaanxi.

==Economy==
As of the mid-19th century, Shaanxi exported animal skins, wine, liquor, and [[musk]]. Money loans were also common, with Shaanxi business people involved in the Guangzhou loan business. Shaanxi commonly imported European animal skins, watches, Chinese language books, and cloth.<ref name=Roberts1>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Edmund|title=Embassy to the Eastern Courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat|year=1837|publisher=Harper & Brothers|location=New York|page=123|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/123/|access-date=2013-10-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016074209/http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/123/|archive-date=2013-10-16|url-status=live}}</ref>
