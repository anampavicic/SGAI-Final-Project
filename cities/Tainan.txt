'''Tainan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aɪ|ˈ|n|ɑː|n|}}),<ref>{{Dictionary.com|Tainan}}</ref> officially '''Tainan City''',{{efn native lang|tw|name=word1}} is a [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]] in southern Taiwan, facing the [[Taiwan Strait]] on its western coast. Tainan is the oldest city on the island and commonly called the "[[Taiwan Prefecture|prefectural]] capital"{{efn native lang|tw|t=府城|p=Fǔchéng|m=Hú-siâⁿ}} for its over 260 years of history as the capital of Taiwan under the [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch rule]], the [[Kingdom of Tungning]] and later [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Qing dynasty rule]] until 1887. Tainan's complex history of comebacks, redefinitions and renewals inspired its popular nickname "the Phoenix City".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=99336&CtNode=124 | title=Rise of the Phoenix? | last=Chang | first=Winnie | work=Taiwan Today | date=April 1994 | access-date=2012-01-10 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728082224/http://taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=99336&CtNode=124 | archive-date=2012-07-28 | url-status=live }}</ref> Tainan is classified as a "Sufficiency"-level [[global city]] by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The World According to GaWC 2020 |url=https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2020t.html |website=GaWC – Research Network |publisher=Globalization and World Cities |access-date=31 August 2020 |archive-date=24 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200824031341/https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2020t.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

As Taiwan's oldest [[urban area]] with 400 years history, Tainan was initially established by the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) as a ruling and trading base called [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]] during [[Dutch Formosa|the Dutch colonial rule on the island]]. After [[Koxinga]] [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia|seized the Dutch fort]] in 1662, Tainan remained as the capital of the [[Kingdom of Tungning|Tungning Kingdom]] ruled by [[House of Koxinga]] until 1683 and afterwards the capital of [[Taiwan Prefecture]] under the [[Qing dynasty]] until 1887, when the new provincial capital was first moved to present-day [[Taichung]], and then to [[Taipei]] eventually. Following the [[Treaty of shimonoseki|cession of Taiwan]], Tainan became the second capital of the short-lived [[Republic of Formosa]] from June to October in 1895 until the [[Capitulation of Tainan]] by the invading forces of [[Japanese empire]]. Under [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], the city was the seat of [[Tainan Prefecture]]. After the [[surrender of Japan]] in World War II, the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] took control of Taiwan in 1945 and reorganized the city as a [[provincial city (Taiwan)|provincial city]] in [[Taiwan Province]]; a role that would remain in place until 2010 when the city was merged with nearby [[Tainan County]] into a new special municipality.

Tainan has been historically regarded as one of the oldest cities in Taiwan, and its former name, Tayouan, has been claimed to be the origin of the name "Taiwan". It is also one of Taiwan's cultural capitals, for its rich folk cultures including the famous [[Taiwanese cuisine|local street food and traditional cuisine]], extensively preserved [[Taoist]] rites and other living local traditions covering everything from child birth to funerals. The city houses the first [[Tainan Confucian Temple|Confucian school–temple]] in Taiwan, built in 1665,<ref>{{Cite web |language=en |title=Tainan Confucian Temple |url=http://confucius.cca.gov.tw/english/navigator/map02.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501181411/http://confucius.cca.gov.tw/english/navigator/map02.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=2008-05-01 |access-date=2008-08-19 |publisher=Council for Cultural Affairs}}</ref> the remains of the Eastern and Southern gates of the old city, and countless other historical monuments. Tainan claims more [[Buddhist]] and Taoist temples than any other city in Taiwan.

==History==
===Early history===
Archaeological excavations in [[Zuojhen District, Tainan|Zuojhen District]] suggest that the Tainan region has been inhabited for at least 20,000 to 31,000 years. The indigenous [[Siraya people|Siraya]] tribe dominated the region by the 16th century. The Sakam people of the Sinkan sub-tribe inhabited the area of the present-day city.<ref name="蔡玉仙等編">{{cite book |editor=蔡玉仙 |display-editors=etal |publisher=[[Tainan City Government]] |year=2007 |script-title=zh:府城文史 | language = zh-hans |isbn=9789860094343 }}</ref> Other Sirayan sub-tribes, including the Soelangh, Mattauw and Baccloangh inhabited the surrounding area.

By the late 16th century, Chinese merchants and fishermen had set up several bases along the west coast of the island, including a sandbar across the ''Taikang Inner Sea'' ({{zh|t=[[:zh:臺江內海|臺江內海]]|poj=Tâi-kang lāi-hái}}) off the bay of Sakam village (modern-day [[Fort Provintia]]). The Chinese adopted ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Taioan|zh|3=大員}}'' (modern-day [[Anping District|Anping]]) as the name of the sandbar.<ref name="蔡玉仙等編"/><ref name="Shih Shou-chien">{{cite book |editor=Shih Shou-chien |editor-link=Shih Shou-chien |year=2003 |trans-title=Ilha Formosa: the Emergence of Taiwan on the World Scene in the 17th Century |script-title=zh:福爾摩沙 : 十七世紀的臺灣、荷蘭與東亞 | language = zh-hans |publisher = National Palace Museum |isbn=9789575624415 }}</ref><ref name="Kato" /> Slightly north of ''Taioan'', along the shoreline near ''Bassemboy'' ({{zh|t=北線尾|poj=Pak-siàn-bóe|labels=no}}), Japanese traders established bases for trade with China.<ref name="Shih Shou-chien"/> The early Chinese and Japanese also traded with the Sirayan people. Salt and food was exchanged for deer hides and dried deer meat. The Siraya people were influenced by both Chinese and Japanese cultures and lifestyles. They started to use Chinese words in their language, use Japanese [[tantō]] in ritual events, and also migrated inland due to the influx of newcomers. By the time the Europeans arrived, the influence of Chinese and Japanese traders and fishermen was already prominent.<ref name="Shih Shou-chien"/><ref name="Murray A.

Early Dutch colonists had attempted but failed to control [[Macau]] and the [[Penghu islands]]. In July 1622, the [[Dutch East India Company]] textile merchant [[Cornelis Reijersen|Cornelis Reyersz]] sailed to Taiwan in search of a suitable location to build a trading post. In 1624 he established a small fort named 'Orange' on the sandy peninsula they called '''Tayouan''' (modern-day [[Anping District|Anping]]). The fort was then expanded and renamed {{nowrap|'''[[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]]'''}}. The settlement was initially designed as a base to attack their Spanish rivals and as a trading post between China and [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] in Indonesia. Later the post became the center of Dutch trade between China, Japan and Europe.<ref name="Shih Shou-chien"/><ref name="Murray A. Rubinstein"/> During the governorship of [[Pieter Nuyts]] (1627–29), there was hostility between the Dutch and Japanese merchants, leading at one point to Nuyts being held hostage by a Japanese trader, Hamada Yahee.<ref name="Kato">{{cite book |last=Kato |first=Mitsutaka |orig-year=1940 |year=2007 |script-title =zh:昨日府城 明星台南: 發現日治下的老臺南 |language=zh-tw |translator={{lang|zh-hant|黃秉珩}} |publisher=臺南市文化資產保護協會 |isbn=9789572807996 }}</ref><ref name="Murray A.

The [[Dutch pacification campaign on Formosa]] was a series of military actions and diplomatic moves undertaken in 1635 and 1636. They aimed at subduing hostile aboriginal villages in the south-western region of the island. In 1642 the Dutch seized the Spanish garrison at [[Santisima Trinidad (Taiwan)|Santisima Trinidad]] in [[Keelung]]. The Dutch East India Company became the first authority to claim control of the whole of Formosa, with Fort Zeelandia as the seat of government.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://anping.tncg.gov.tw/tour/tua_01.jsp?ID=1&Lang=E |title= Anping Harbor National Historical Park |publisher= Tainan City Government |access-date= 2010-03-31 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091015111400/http://anping.tncg.gov.tw/tour/tua_01.jsp?ID=1&Lang=E |archive-date= 2009-10-15 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

Tensions arose between the Dutch and the Chinese inhabitants of Taiwan due to heavy Dutch taxation and Dutch participation in plunder during the collapse of the [[Ming dynasty]]. Eventually, this led to the brief, but bloody, [[Guo Huaiyi Rebellion]] in 1652.<ref name="Murray A. Rubinstein"/> The Dutch crushed the revolt only with the help of the local Sinkanese.

The settlements near to Fort Zeelandia expanded as a result of the Dutch trading post in the area. In 1653, the Dutch built a new fort, [[Fort Provintia]], in the Sakam area as a center for an agricultural colony. The Dutch encouraged Chinese farmers to migrate to Taiwan to grow rice and sugar cane. The Dutch settlement in southern Taiwan was so successful that, by the 1650s, it had overtaken Batavia.<ref name="Shih Shou-chien"/>

===Kingdom of Tungning===
[[File:Statue of Koxinga.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Koxinga]] in Koxinga's Shrine]]
{{main|Kingdom of Tungning}}
[[Koxinga]] (also known as Zheng Chenggong) was a Ming loyalist and chief commander of the Ming troops on the maritime front for the later emperors of the withering dynasty. In 1661, Koxinga attacked the Dutch colonists in Taiwan. After a nine-month siege, the Dutch Governor of Taiwan, [[Frederik Coyett]], surrendered Fort Zeelandia to Koxinga on 1 February 1662.<ref name="Shih Shou-chien"/> This effectively ended 38 years of Dutch rule on Taiwan. Koxinga then devoted himself to transforming Taiwan into a military base for loyalists who wanted to restore the [[Ming dynasty]].

Koxinga set about making Taiwan a base for the Ming loyalist movement. Fort Provintia was renamed ''[[Kingdom of Tungning|Tungtu]]'', and Fort Zeelandia became [[Anping District|Anping]]. Koxinga set up military colonies on the surrounding plains to help feed his forces.<ref name="Shih Shou-chien"/> Many suburbs surrounding Tainan City today include in their names "Ying", "Jia", and "Tian", all derived from this event. After the death of Koxinga in 1662, his son, [[Zheng Jing]], changed the name of Dongdu to Dong Ning. His chief minister, [[Chen Yonghua]], introduced Chinese bureaucracy, built [[Taiwan Confucian Temple|the first Confucius temple]] on the island, and introduced the method of salt production to coastal areas. The British were invited to set up a trading post in [[Anping District|Anping]] to continue trade between Taiwan, Japan, and South East Asia. This helped to maintain the region as a center of trade.

===Qing dynasty===
[[File:臺南接官亭石坊.JPG|thumb|right|Jieguanting ({{lang|zh|接官亭}}) in ''Go-tiau-kang'', Tainan gateway to the sea during the Qing dynasty]]
{{main|Taiwan under Qing rule}}
The death of Zheng Jing in 1681 was followed by a struggle for succession. Seizing the advantage presented by the infighting, on July 17, 1683, [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] naval commander [[Shi Lang]] defeated the Tungning fleet in the [[Battle of Penghu]]. Two days later, Qing troops landed at Tungning and encountered little resistance. In 1684 the kingdom was incorporated into the Qing Empire as part of Fujian province, ending two decades of rule by the Zheng family.<ref name="Murray A. Rubinstein"/> [[Taiwan Prefecture]] was established, with its prefectural seat '''Taiwanfu'''<ref>Also '''Taiwan-fu''', '''Taiwan Fu''', '''Taiwan Foo''', &c.</ref> at modern-day Tainan. Taiwan County is also established as the first county of the Prefecture, located around the prefecture seat.

In 1721, Chinese peasants and indigenous tribes rose in rebellion against Qing misrule. The rebels, led by [[Zhu Yigui]], captured Tainan without a fight. Turmoil ensued as the rebels soon fought amongst themselves. It was only after a Qing army was dispatched from mainland China that order was restored. Zhu was captured and executed. As Qing law prohibited the building of city walls in Taiwan, Qing authorities decided to create a defensive boundary around the city by growing bamboo around the perimeter. After several further uprisings across the island, work on a city wall began in the late 1780s.<ref name="蔡玉仙等編"/>

A flood in 1823 brought rich silt from nearby rivers, which formed a widespread new fertile plain across the Taijiang bay area between Tainan and Anping. A canal system called ''Go-tiau-kang'' ([[:zh:五條港 (臺南)|五條港]]; {{zh|poj=Gō͘-tiâu-káng}}) was built to keep the port in Tainan functioning but prevented large ships from entering the bay.<ref name="蔡玉仙等編"/>

From 1825 until 1866 a shipyard in Tainan produced warships for the Qing navy from native wood.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Turton |first1=Michael |title=Notes from Central Taiwan: Taiwan's shrinking middle ground |url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2023/07/31/2003803999 |website=taipeitimes.com |publisher=Taipei Times |access-date=31 July 2023}}</ref>

After 174 years of restrictions on trade with the Europeans, the Qing reopened [[Anping District|Anping port]] as part of the [[Treaty of Tianjin|Tianjin treaty]] following the [[Second Opium War]] in 1858. The Anping Customs house was established in 1864. Western merchants built trading posts near the remains of [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]].

Following the murder of 54 Japanese sailors by Paiwan aborigines near the southwestern tip of Taiwan in 1871, the punitive [[Japanese Expedition of 1874 to Taiwan]] revealed the fragility of the Qing dynasty's hold on Taiwan. As a result, the Qing sent the imperial commissioner [[Shen Baozhen]] to Taiwan to strengthen its defense. In Tainan, Shen made several efforts to modernize the defenses including inviting French engineers to design the [[Eternal Golden Castle]] in Erkunshen. He also recommended setting up a telegraph cable link between Tainan and [[Amoy]].<ref name="蔡玉仙等編"/><ref name="Murray A.

After over 200 years of development, Tainan had become the largest city in Taiwan and a Chinese city with foreign influence. The following is a description of the city by the Scottish missionary [[William Campbell (missionary)|William Campbell]] upon his first arrival to the island in 1871:
{{quotation|As to Taiwan-fu itself, I may say that the brick wall which surrounds it is about fifteen feet in thickness, twenty-five in height, and some five miles in circumference. Lofty watch-towers are built over the four main gateways, and large spaces within the city are given to the principal temples and ''yamens''—or quarters occupied by the civil and military mandarins. There is much need in Taiwan-fu for the carrying out of a City Improvement Scheme. Pleasant walks, no doubt, there are, and some of the shops have an appearance which is decidedly attractive; but, as a rule, the streets are narrow, winding, ill-paved, and odorous.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sketches from Formosa|year=1915|last=Campbell|first=William|author-link=William Campbell (missionary)|publisher=Marshall Brothers|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/sketchesfromtaiw00camprich|ol=7051071M|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sketchesfromtaiw00camprich/page/16 16]–17|access-date=2014-11-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151219205747/https://archive.org/details/sketchesfromtaiw00camprich|archive-date=2015-12-19|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

In 1885, the Qing government commenced work to develop the island into [[Taiwan Province (Qing)|Taiwan Province]]. The capital of the island (and its designation as "Taiwanfu") was moved to Toatun (modern-day [[Taichung]]). The name of the old Taiwanfu was changed to '''Tainanfu''',<ref>Also '''Tainan-fu''', '''Tainan Fu''', '''Tainan Foo''', &c.</ref> the seat of [[Tainan Prefecture (Qing dynasty)|Tainan Prefecture]].

===Japanese rule===

As a consequence of the Chinese losing the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1895, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands were ceded to Japan by the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]]. The [[Republic of Formosa]] was proclaimed in Tainan in May 1895, in an effort to forestall the incoming Japanese occupation. A Japanese army arrived at Tainan in October 1895. [[Liu Yongfu]] and the other Republican leaders fled, leaving the city in disarray. A Scottish missionary, [[Thomas Barclay (missionary)|Thomas Barclay]], was chosen by local elites and foreign merchants to negotiate the Japanese entry into the city. As a result, Tainan was [[Capitulation of Tainan (1895)|taken without resistance]]. Under [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], Tainan was initially administered under {{nihongo||臺南縣|Tainan Ken}}.<ref name="蔡玉仙等編"/> With a population of about 50,000 in 1904, Tainan was Taiwan's most populous city.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Takekoshi |first1=Yosaburō |author-link=Takekoshi Yosaburō |title=Japanese rule in Formosa |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.180113 |date=1907 |publisher = Longmans, Green, and co. |location = London, New York, Bombay and Calcutta |ol=6986981M |oclc=753129 |chapter=Chapter XIII: Population and future development of the island resources |page=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.180113/page/n225 200] }}</ref>

The anti-Japanese uprising known as the [[Tapani Incident]] began in Ta-pa-ni (modern-day [[Yujing District|Yujing]]) on April 9, 1915. The revolt, led by {{Interlanguage link multi|Yu Qingfang|zh|3=余清芳}}, spread quickly across the whole island and was supported by both Chinese and indigenous Taiwanese. The Japanese crushed the uprising. Many villages were destroyed and thousands of people were killed during the repression which followed. Yu Qingfang was captured on August 22, 1915. More than 800 people were sentenced to death in Tainan. Over 100 of them were executed while the rest were pardoned by the new [[Emperor Taishō|Taishō Emperor]]. The place where the rebellion began, Xilai Temple in Tainan ([[:zh:臺南西來庵|臺南西來庵]]), was demolished.<ref name="蔡玉仙等編"/> The event marked a turning point in Japanese policy from forced pacification to full integration of Taiwan into the Japanese Empire.

The Japanese renamed the city to {{nihongo||臺南廳|Tainan Chō}} in 1901, and then {{nihongo4||臺南州|Tainan Shū}} in 1920. [[Tainan Prefecture]] included modern-day [[Yunlin County|Yunlin]], [[Chiayi County|Chiayi]], and the wider region of Tainan. Tainan served as the capital city. The Japanese transformed Tainan by building modern infrastructure, including schools, a courthouse, city hall, new telecommunication facilities, an extensive freight and passenger rail network, a new Anping canal replacing the ''Go-tiau-kang'', an airport, and an [[Chianan Canal|irrigation system]] across the Tainan and Chiayi regions. Modern urban designs were introduced; old narrow streets and city walls were demolished and replaced with wide streets that form the cityscape of the modern-day Tainan city center.<ref name="Kato"/> They also introduced much needed sanitary reforms.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=J.

The [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) [[History of Taiwan since 1945|took over]] Taiwan on 25 October 1945 after [[World War II]]. Tainan [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|City]] and [[Tainan County]] were established and became separate local entities under [[Taiwan Province]] in 1946. There was civil unrest in Tainan as part of the [[February 28 Incident]] in 1947. [[Tang De-Jhang]], an ethnic Japanese man and Japanese educated lawyer, was a member of government which set up "The February 28 Incident Commission" and a popular candidate for city mayor, was accused of being a separatist and arrested by the ROC army on March 11. He was tortured and executed the next day in the park in front of Tainan City Hall (now named [[Tang Te-chang Memorial Park]]). Tang was posthumously pronounced not guilty by court later in March.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.228.org.tw/history228_elite_detail.php?id=27 |script-title=zh:湯德章 |publisher=Memorial Foundation of 228 |language=zh-tw |access-date=2010-04-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121000413/http://www.228.org.tw/history228_elite_detail.php?id=27 |archive-date=January 21, 2010 }}</ref> Like other regions in Taiwan, many people in Tainan suffered for their real or perceived opposition to the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT, Chinese Nationalist Party) during the [[White Terror (Taiwan)|autocratic era]].

[[File:Txu-oclc-6557994-index-451.jpg|left|thumb|Map of northern Tainan and surrounding region (1950)]]
The city held its first councilor and mayoral elections in 1950. In the 1960s, Tainan was overtaken by [[Kaohsiung]] as the economic center of southern Taiwan due to the redevelopment of [[Port of Kaohsiung|Kaohsiung port]]. While Tainan City struggled through the second half of twentieth century, the county, especially the river south region, benefited from prioritization by national programs. The completion of the [[National Highway No. 1 (Taiwan)|National Highway No. 1]] was followed by the building of many industrial parks and other road improvements. As a result, the city sprawled inland into North, East and then the Yongkang and Rende districts.

In 1992, a redevelopment plan in the West district, to widen Haian Rd and build an underground plaza proved a failure as lack of geological surveying and overall planning meant that the works ran into a layer of groundwater. The development destroyed part of the historic ''Go-tiau-kang'' area. As a consequence, the Zhongzheng Road district, previously the most popular shopping precinct in Tainan since Japanese rule, went into decline due to the poor quality of the environment. By the mid-1990s, there was a growing awareness of the need to protect Tainan's historical and cultural treasures. Since then, the government and civil societies have worked to protect Tainan's heritage. It is an ongoing issue for Tainan to protect its past while reviving its old business center.

Following the establishment of the [[Southern Taiwan Science Park]] in 1995, the outskirt of the city saw a rapid growth in population through the 2000s. The city became more prosperous after the completion of several major transport infrastructure plans. The city center shifted eastward in the mid-1990s, closer to the densely populated Yongkang, East and North districts. There are several redevelopment plans to transform these districts into the new business centers of the city.

On [[3-19 shooting incident|March 19, 2004]], President [[Chen Shui-bian]] was shot while campaigning for reelection in Tainan, a city that has been a major center for the pro-independent movement since the end of Japanese rule. On October 21, 2008, Chinese ARATS Vice President [[Zhang Mingqing]] was injured when he encountered protesters in Tainan Confucius Temple.{{CN|date=January 2023}}

==Culture==
[[File:Chuniaomugong.JPG|thumb|right|Ritual adulthood celebration for all 16-year-olds]]
[[File:Bawan umiao.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ba-wan]] served with sweet sauce]]
[[File:PICT0345.JPG|thumb|right|Datianhou Gong, built in 1664]]
Tainan claims its name as one of the Taiwanese cultural capitals for its abundant historic monument and citizen lifestyle. The city is dotted by Taoist temples, Buddhist temples and churches. Many of them are among the oldest in Taiwan. The city also has its own unique traditions and cuisines developed by Chinese frontiers over its long history.

===Folk cultures===
The lives of Tainan citizens are closely related to many [[Shen (Chinese religion)|Chinese Deities]] and [[Chinese temple|temples]]. Parents bring their children to the "Weaving Maid Goddess" ({{zh|t=七娘媽|poj=Chhit-niû-má}}), the children's goddess, to wish for goodwill. Traditionally Chinese people step into adulthood when they are 20. In Tainan, there is a large ritual celebration for all 16-year-olds on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month, the goddess's birthday. This extended celebration is unique to Tainan: In the past, families with children working in the harbour took the advantage of this ceremony to show the employers that their children should be paid in adult rate after this day.

Before any form of examination, people visit the temple of [[Wenchang Wang|Wenchangdijun]], the God of Literature, to pray for blessings of good grades. One of the Wenchang temples is on the top floor of the [[Fort Provintia]]. Many final-year high school students preparing for university exams visit the temple in June, before the exam. Those seeking for good marriage will worship [[Yue Lao|Yuelao]], the God of Marriage. People also visit temples for many reasons, from simply praying for good luck to celebrating particular Deity's birthday to even communicating with the Netherworld.<ref name="台南市文資導讀">{{cite web |url= http://www.tnc.gov.tw/book/fron/index.html |script-title= zh:台南市文資導讀 |publisher= Tainan City Government |language= zh-tw |access-date= 2011-05-12 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110702010553/http://www.tnc.gov.tw/book/fron/index.html |archive-date= 2011-07-02 |url-status= live }}</ref>

A wedding ceremony in Tainan is a series of complex processes that are very exact and detailed. Both groom and bride need to prepare 12 specific gifts representing different meanings during their engagement ceremony with more to come in the wedding. People believe this complexity is a sign of being civilized.<ref name="台南市文資導讀"/>

Anping residents use a special symbol called Sword Lion to keep bad spirits away. During Zheng's regime, Anping was one of Koxinga's main naval stations. When returning home from military drills, soldiers would put lion-face shields on the main gates of their houses and insert their swords crosswise in the lion's mouth. Locals incorporate this symbol into the design of their houses as a symbol of spiritual security.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://anping.tncg.gov.tw/tour/tud_01.jsp?ID=25&Lang=E |title= Sword Lion |publisher= Anping Harbor National Historical Park |access-date= 2011-05-12 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060223172941/http://anping.tncg.gov.tw/tour/tud_01.jsp?ID=25&Lang=E |archive-date= 2006-02-23 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

===Cuisine===
During the more than 200 years that Tainan spent as the local capital the population developed cosmopolitan tastes due to exposure to food from around the world. Portions are often larger than elsewhere in Taiwan.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Watt |first1=Louise |title=In Tainan, the Focus is on Sweetness and Tradition |url=https://topics.amcham.com.tw/2021/01/tainan-focus-on-sweetness-tradition/ |website=topics.amcham.com.tw/ |date=22 January 2021 |publisher=Taiwan Topics |access-date=24 January 2021 |archive-date=26 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210126193855/https://topics.amcham.com.tw/2021/01/tainan-focus-on-sweetness-tradition/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Many well-known [[Taiwanese cuisine|Taiwanese food dishes]] originated in Tainan. Since Tainan was a center of sugar production, Tainan cuisine tends to be sweeter than other Taiwanese cuisines. For example, eel noodle soup has a distinctive sweet and sour taste. [[Milkfish]] dishes are very popular in Tainan, where locals also call it "Koxinga's fish" ({{zh|t=國姓魚|poj=kok-sèng-hî}}). People believe the Chinese name of the fish ({{zh|t=虱目魚|poj=sat-ba̍k-hî|labels=no}}) was given by Koxinga, and this name has been loaned into Japanese as {{nihongo4||サバヒー|sabahī}}. The fish are bred in farms located in the coastal outskirts of the city. Many Tainan restaurants and snack stands have histories that trace back to the Qing or Japanese eras.<ref name="台南市文資導讀"/>

On Guo Hua Street (國華街), a lot of restaurants and street vendors sell local cuisine, including such dishes as "savory rich pudding" ([[:zh:碗粿|碗粿]]), o-a-tsian ([[oyster omelet]]), [[gua bao]], and [[popiah]]. Local people tend to have these dishes either in the morning or at noon.{{citation needed | date=February 2016}}

Tainan is considered the center of Taiwanese coffee culture with a number of coffee producers in the hills around the city. Coffee plants were first brought to Tainan in 1884 by the British.<ref name="Coffee Culture" >{{cite web |author=Staff Writer |title=FEATURE: Growers along Tainan's 'Coffee Road' want to put local brew on national map |url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2021/02/17/2003752399 |website=www.taipeitimes.com |date=17 February 2021 |publisher=Taipei Times |access-date=17 February 2021 |archive-date=17 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210217164404/https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2021/02/17/2003752399 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Temples===
[[File:臺南竹溪寺山門.JPG|thumb|right|Zhuxi Temple]]
Tainan is famous for its diversity and density of [[Chinese temple|temples and shrines]]. Some of them are the only of its kind on Taiwan Island. In all, there are officially listed seven Buddhist temples and eight Taoist shrines (七寺八廟).<ref name="蔡玉仙等編"/> {{As of|2015}}, Tainan has the most numbers of registered temples among other municipalities, cities or counties in Taiwan, reaching 1,613 temples.<ref>{{cite news |work=Taipei Times |date=15 Jul 2015 |page=5 |author=Lee Hsin-fang |last2=Chung |first2=Jake |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/07/15/2003623092 |title=Tainan has most of nation's 12,106 temples |access-date=15 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715111332/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/07/15/2003623092 |archive-date=15 July 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===National Cheng Kung University Museum===
The [[National Cheng Kung University Museum]] is located at the National Cheng Kung University. One of the youngest museums in Tainan. Exhibits important objects from the history of education in southern Taiwan. The museum is ICOM member since 2016.

===Fort Provintia===
[[Fort Provintia]] was built in 1653 by the Dutch during their colonization of Taiwan and was eventually surrendered to Koxinga. Since 1945, the site has been known as "Chihkan Tower", a phonetic derivation from "Sakam" (also spelled "Chakam" or "Sakkam").
In addition to the site's architectural and artistic significance, its library of dictionaries and business transactions documents the Siraya language spoken by the native inhabitants of the region during Dutch rule.

===Shopping and recreation===
[[File:Hayashi Department Store (night).jpg|thumb|right|220px|One of the oldest department stores in Tainan, built during [[Japanese Taiwan]] era.]]
As Tainan is one of the larger metropolitan areas in Taiwan, it has many department stores, shopping malls and prestigious boutiques. Several of the best-known luxury brands have branches or counters in Tainan.
Flower Night Market is one of the most famous [[Night markets in Taiwan]] and it is often considered to be the largest night market in Taiwan; however, unlike the others, this night market is open for business three days a week – Thursday, Saturday and Sunday.

===Beehives===

In [[Yanshuei District]], the most important and prominent fireworks in [[Lantern Festival]] are the so-called "beehives", essentially multiple launchers of bottle rockets. These rocket forts are actually thousands of bottle rockets arranged row atop row in an iron-and-wooden framework. The set-up looks like a beehive full of unleashed gunpowder. When the contraption is ignited, rockets shoot out rapidly in all directions. Dazzling explosives whiz and whirl across the sky and often into the crowd itself, both thrilling and intimidating the spectators.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

[[File:Chianan.jpg|thumb|A typical scene of River North Region]]

===The Great Cross Street===
The earliest plan of the city was designed by Dutch colonist Cornelis Jansz. Plockhoy, the designer of this new settlement, laid a 25-30m wide main street (on today's Minquan Rd Sec. 2) across the settlement and radial roads than ran deep into agricultural developments .<ref name="Shih Shou-chien"/> The Han Chinese settlement “Heliaogang Jie” (today's Zhongyi Rd) later crossed the main street of Provintia and formed the so-called ''Shizi Dajie'' (十字大街) or The Great Cross Street.<ref name="蔡玉仙等編"/> With the fall of the Ming dynasty, new migrants flooded into the settlement. Chinese population boomed from 5,000 to 35,000 between 1640 and 1661. As a result, farmers, deer hunters, traders and craftsmen each formed a colony on the cross street.<ref name="都市空間的溯源與演化">{{Cite book |last=Weng |first=Jinshan (翁金山) |publisher=財團法人成大建築文教基金會 |year=2002 |language=zh |script-title=zh:台南市都市設計規劃綱要之研究 1 都市空間的溯源與演化}}</ref>

Due to the Chinese tradition where different trades and regions worship different Taoist gods, the city later developed into neighborhoods, each with own center temple.<ref name="都市空間的溯源與演化" /> Now, after 300 years of Chinese migration, the city has become a showcase of both Taoist and Chinese Buddhist temples. Although the city has transformed dramatically since the late 19th century, the temples remain because of their importance to the locals. Some of the early administration centers have also been transformed into temples for political and social reasons. An administrative building of the Tungning Kingdom became temple of the [[Mazu (goddess)|sea goddess]], and the location where Tungning Kingdom performed annual ceremonies of prayer to Heaven is now the Altar of Heaven Temple. Castle Provintia, one of two Dutch forts in Tainan, now has a sea god temple and a literacy god temple built on top of it, creating East-West fusion architecture. Many Han Chinese religious and historic monuments can be found near the old cross street centered by the Castle Provintia.

===Japanese Redevelopment Program===
The cityscape of modern Tainan was founded under the urban redevelopment programs carried out by Japanese colonial government. The city center adopted a Baroque design similar to the [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|Paris renovation in mid 19th century]], the plan connected major facilities via a system of wide streets and five square-roundabouts. Among the five squares, {{nihongo4|Taishō Park|大正公園||modern-day [[Tang Te-chang Memorial Park]]}} at the center is the most important crossing point. The square is surrounded by the city hall, the fire brigade and the weather bureau. It is connected by a number of avenues heading towards the train station, the airport, military bases and the dock at the end of the Anping cannel. With the police station and the court nearby, this area demonstrated the power of the colonial government within the city.<ref name="都市空間的溯源與演化" /> The financial district was located in {{nihongo4||白金町|Shirokanechō}} and {{nihongo4||大宮町|Ōmiyachō}} between Taishō park and Anping cannel along {{nihongo4||銀座通り|Ginzadōri}},<ref name="Kato"/> the modern day Zhongzheng Rd. It was the busiest street of the city from Japanese rule to the mid-1990s. Many Colonial Baroque style historic buildings from Japanese era can be found in this part of the city.

===Three Ring Belts===
A three-belt system was adopted by the provincial city official:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gisgroup.com/events/download/5_3/3-4.pdf |title=Green and blue belts reference |access-date=2011-11-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425131759/http://www.gisgroup.com/events/download/5_3/3-4.pdf |archive-date=April 25, 2012 }}</ref> the green boulevard ring, the blue belt Anping cannel and the Zhonghua road system. The green boulevard ring and Zhonghua road system first appeared on the 1937 city redevelopment plan proposed by the Japanese colonial government.

The green boulevard was a Japanese response to the [[Garden city movement|garden city trend]] of early 20th century urban planning.<ref name="都市空間的溯源與演化" /> This system connects the Shuipingwen Park to the west, Tainan Park to the north, [[National Cheng Kung University|NCKU]] to the east and the Athletic park complex to the south. Zhonghua Rd system is an arterial road system, the system now connects major new development areas surrounding the old city center. The Anping cannel ''blue belt'' was created after the completion of the ''Fifth redevelopment area''. The project of ''Fifth redevelopment area'' filled the [[floodplain]] of old Taijiang lagoon and extended the Japanese Anping cannel into Kunshen lagoon to form an artificial island, this area is also known as ''New Anping''. In contrast to the low rise old city center, many high rise buildings are built along these three rings.

===The River South Region===
Beyond the city center, Tainan city can be divided into two: the River South Region and the River North Region, bounded by the [[Zengwen River]].

River South Region belongs to the Tainan metropolitan area. Satellite towns spread across the region in a radial pattern from the city center. [[Southern Taiwan Science Park]] [[Tainan Science Park|Tainan campus]] is located at the north of the region. According to the [[Council for Economic Planning and Development]], this region is designated to grow further into suburban sprawl.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cepd.gov.tw/m1.aspx?sNo=0011780&ex=1&ic=0 |title= CEPD |access-date= 2011-11-02 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120407043134/http://www.cepd.gov.tw/m1.aspx?sNo=0011780&ex=1&ic=0 |archive-date= 2012-04-07 }}</ref>

===The River North Region===
This region is one of the major agricultural centers in Taiwan. There are several regional centers; some of them are as old as Tainan city. These centers are: [[Xinying District|Xinying]], [[Yujing District|Yujing]], [[Jiali District|Jiali]], and [[Madou District|Madou]].

Xinying was the seat of the former Tainan County Government and currently serves as the administration center for the region. Yujing is a regional center for the hilly districts east of the city; it is famous for its mango and was the scene of the [[Tapani incident]]. Jiali is the regional center of the coastal Tainan. It was the base of the Soelangh sub-tribe. Near the bank of the [[Zengwen River]], Madou is the regional center of the lower plain area that bears the name of the river. The town was home to the Mattauw sub-tribe.

==Government and politics==
{{main|Tainan City Government|Tainan City Council}}
{{see also|List of mayors of Tainan|Republic of China municipal elections, 2010#Tainan}}

Tainan City is a [[Special municipality (Republic of China)|special municipality]], which is the highest level local government under Local Government Law of [[Republic of China]]. Technically it is at the same level as Province, although Province is being streamlined. The city is led by the elected city mayor and supervised by the city council. Its subdivisions ''qu'' or districts do not have the autonomy power, instead they are administration units only. Further to the citywide election, there are urban villages (里 ''li'') and neighborhood (鄰 ''lin'') functioning as primary local autonomy entity.

Currently there are two administration centers, one in [[Anping District]] and another in [[Xinying District]]. They are former Provincial Tainan city government and Tainan county government respectively. Administration centers manages citywide affairs and developments such as education and city planning. Apart from administration centers, there are district offices functioning as local access point to the governmental services.

The city has generally been seen as a powerbase for the [[Democratic Progressive Party]], especially in nationwide elections. Although before the merger, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) have always had more seats in the provincial Tainan city council and KMT won the presidential elections (2008) by a narrow margin in the city. On the other hand, [[Democratic Progressive Party]] always dominated former Tainan county. In the first municipal election, after the merger, DPP dominated the political demographics of the city. William Lai, a former member of the Legislative Yuan from the DPP won the first mayoral election in 2010.

===City mayor===
[[File:Huang Wei-Che-2-by Ring Chang (cropped).JPG|thumb|[[Huang Wei-cher]], [[Mayor of Tainan]].]]
In 2001, [[Hsu Tain-Tsair]] of the Democratic Progressive Party was elected with 43% of the vote. His closest rival was Kuomintang legislator Chen Rong-sheng, who garnered 37%. In 2005. Mayor Hsu was re-elected, polling 46% to Chen Rong-sheng's 41%. In 2010, [[William Lai]] of the DPP was elected mayor. However, after Lai's appointment as Premier of the Republic of China in September 2017, the mayor position was filled by [[Li Meng-yen]] as acting mayor.

===Presidential elections===

A majority of city residents have voted for the winning candidates in many presidential elections since the position was first chosen by popular vote in 1996.

====1996 presidential election====

* Annan District was originally the An-Shun township of Tainan County, but was merged into Tainan City in 1946. In 2004, Central District and West District were merged into the new '''West Central''' district.

==Economy==
[[File:TSMC in Tainan Science Park.JPG|thumb|right|TSMC in Tainan Science Park]]

===Industry===
Once reliant on traditional manufacturing industries, the region became a major high-tech industrial hub after the establishment of [[Southern Taiwan Science Park]] in 1995. Optoelectronics, integrated circuits, green energy and biotechnology are the park's dominant industries. Prominent companies are [[Chimei Innolux Corporation|Chimei-Innolux]], [[United Microelectronics Corporation|United Microelectronics]] and [[TSMC]]. With the establishment of Tainan Technology Park, Shugu (Tree Valley) LCD Park and Yonkang Technology Park, the city became a major center for the optoelectronics industry in Taiwan with a complete supply chain.<ref>{{cite web|title=LCD manufacturing in Tainan |url=http://web1.tainan.gov.tw/InvestInTainan_eng/CP/11710/present.aspx |work=Tainan City Government |access-date=20 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520044941/http://web1.tainan.gov.tw/InvestInTainan_eng/CP/11710/present.aspx |archive-date=May 20, 2009 }}</ref>

Tainan still plays an important role in auto parts, food processing, textiles, plastics and other traditional manufacturing. Notable companies include [[Uni-President Enterprises Corporation|Uni-President]], [[Chi Mei Corporation|Chi Mei]] and Tainan Spinning, which have headquarters in the city. Overall, industrial production accounted for 62.6% of the gross city product in 2010.<ref name="Report on the economic structure to CPED">{{cite web|title=Report on the economic structure to CPED|url=http://www.cepd.gov.tw/dn.aspx?uid=10314|work=Tainan City Government|access-date=20 November 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407043144/http://www.cepd.gov.tw/dn.aspx?uid=10314|archive-date=7 April 2012}}</ref>

===Agriculture===
Agriculture is important to the city, especially the River North Region. While fisheries and fish farming signify the coastal districts, rice and fruit farms shaped the landscape of the inland agriculture region. The city is famous for its milkfish, oyster, rice, mango, sugar cane, pomelo (文旦), pineapple and lotus seed. A state-funded [[Tainan District Agricultural Research & Extension Station|agricultural research center]] was established in [[Sinhua District, Tainan|Sinhua District]] to ensure the market competitiveness of the crop.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tainan District Agricultural Research & Extension Station, COA |url=http://tndais.coa.gov.tw/view.php?catid=351 |publisher=COA |access-date=18 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306173655/http://tndais.coa.gov.tw/view.php?catid=351 |archive-date=March 6, 2014 }}</ref> The headquarters of the [[World Vegetable Center]], an [[Nonprofit organization|NPO]] that aims to improve crop quality in poorer countries, is in [[Shanhua District]].<ref>{{cite web|title=AVRDC|url=http://avrdc.org/?page_id=698|access-date=18 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730074112/http://avrdc.org/?page_id=698|archive-date=30 July 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

Once dominant industries, salt and sugar production are declining into irrelevance. Taiyen (Taiwan salt) co. and Taiwan Sugar Corp., both headquartered in Tainan, transformed to businesses in biotechnology, quality agriculture, retail and tourism.

Orchid growing is one of the most symbolic agriculture industry for its well-known brand name in the [[floristry]] world. A nationally founded special plantation district with R&D resources is established in [[Houbi District]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Taiwan Orchid Plantation|url=http://top.tainan.gov.tw/a.php|access-date=20 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021041136/http://top.tainan.gov.tw/a.php|archive-date=2011-10-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Tourism===
