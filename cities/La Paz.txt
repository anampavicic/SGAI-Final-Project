The city, in west-central Bolivia {{cvt|68|km|0}} southeast of [[Lake Titicaca]], is set in a canyon created by the [[Choqueyapu River]]. It is in a bowl-like depression, part of the Amazon basin, surrounded by the high mountains of the [[Altiplano]]. Overlooking the city is the triple-peaked [[Illimani]]. Its peaks are always snow-covered and can be seen from many parts of the city.

La Paz was founded on 20 October 1548, by the Spanish [[conquistador]] Captain [[Alonso de Mendoza]], at the site of the [[Inca Empire|Inca]] settlement of [[Laja, Bolivia|Laja]] as a connecting point between the commercial routes that led from [[Potosí]] and [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]] to [[Lima]]; the full name of the city was originally ''Nuestra Señora de La Paz'' (meaning ''[[Our Lady of Peace]]'') in commemoration of the restoration of peace following the [[Rebellion|insurrection]] of [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] and fellow conquistadors against the first [[viceroy]] of [[Peru]].

Since its founding, the city was the site of numerous revolts. In 1781, the [[indigenous people|indigenous]] leader and independence activist [[Túpac Katari]] laid siege to the city for a total of six months, but was finally defeated. On 16 July 1809, the Bolivian patriot [[Pedro Domingo Murillo]] ignited a revolution for independence, marking the beginning of the [[Spanish American wars of independence|Spanish American Wars of Independence]], which gained the freedom of South American states in 1821.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.boliviabella.com/history-of-la-paz.html |title=The History of La Paz, Bolivia |website=boliviabella.com |publisher=Bolivia Bella |access-date=14 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901214920/http://www.boliviabella.com/history-of-la-paz.html |archive-date=1 September 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>

As the seat of the government of Bolivia, La Paz is the site of the [[Palacio Quemado]], the presidential palace. It is also the seat of the Bolivian [[legislature]], the [[Plurinational Legislative Assembly]], and numerous government departments and agencies.

[[File:Calle Jaén, La Paz.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Calle Jaén in the historic center of La Paz, contains well-preserved [[Spanish Colonial architecture|Spanish Colonial]] buildings.]]

The Spanish conquistadors founded the city in 1548 with the name ''Nuestra Señora de La Paz'' (meaning ''[[Blessed Virgin Mary|Our Lady]] of [[Peace]]''). The name commemorated the restoration of peace following the insurrection of [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] and fellow conquistadors four years earlier against [[Blasco Núñez Vela]], the first [[viceroy]] of [[Peru]].<ref name="Crespo-1" />

In 1825, after the decisive victory of the [[republicanism|republicans]] at [[Ayacucho]] over the Spanish army in the course of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]], the city's full name was changed to ''La Paz de Ayacucho'' (meaning ''The Peace of Ayacucho'').

The region in which La Paz is located in was known as Chuquiago Marka (''marka'' means village;<ref>[http://www.katari.org/diccionario/diccionario.php?listletter=aymara&display=12 www.katari.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210501173911/https://www.katari.org/diccionario/diccionario.php?listletter=aymara&display=12 |date=1 May 2021 }} (Aymara – Spanish) ''Marka'': ''Pueblo'', ''ciudad''.</ref> ''Chuqi Yapu'' means 'gold farm', probably due to the exploitation of gold nuggets in the small rivers of the place;<ref>{{Cite web |title=Acta de fundacion de La Paz, Bolivia |url=https://jorgemachicado.blogspot.com/2009/05/aflp_21.html |access-date=20 August 2021 |website=APUNTES JURIDICOS™ |archive-date=20 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210820182159/https://jorgemachicado.blogspot.com/2009/05/aflp_21.html |url-status=live }}</ref> spelling differences due to Aymara writing compared to Spanish transliteration) in the Aymara language, leading former [[President of Bolivia]] [[Evo Morales]] to suggest renaming the city to "Chuquiago Marka" in a speech in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web |date=10 June 2013 |title=CHUQUIAGO MARKA,Y LA EXPANSIÓN DE TIWANAKU |url=http://www.laprensa.com.bo/diario/actualidad/la-paz/20131006/chuquiago-markay-la-expansion-de-tiwanaku_51079_83058.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221162349/http://www.laprensa.com.bo/diario/actualidad/la-paz/20131006/chuquiago-markay-la-expansion-de-tiwanaku_51079_83058.html |archive-date=21 December 2014 |access-date=20 August 2021 |website=La Prensa}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Ariñez |first=Rubén |date=20 October 2017 |title=Evo sugiere cambiar el nombre de La Paz por Chuquiago Marka |work=La Razón |url=http://www.la-razon.com/ciudades/Evo-plantea-cambio-nombre-La_Paz-Chuquiago-Marka-aniversario-469_0_2804719510.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200124195030/http://www.la-razon.com/ciudades/Evo-plantea-cambio-nombre-La_Paz-Chuquiago-Marka-aniversario-469_0_2804719510.html |access-date=20 August 2021 |archive-date=24 January 2020}}</ref>

{{Main|History of La Paz}}
[[File:Bolivia, La Paz; Illimani in background LCCN2016821765 (cropped).tif|left|thumb|View of La Paz between 1909 and 1920]]
This area had been the site of an Inca city on a major trading route.

Although the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s entered the area in 1535, they did not found La Paz until 1548. Originally it was to be at the site of the [[Native American (Americas)|Native American]] settlement, [[Laja, Bolivia|Laja]]. The town site was moved a few days later to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago, which is more clement.<ref name="Crespo-1">{{Cite book |author=Crespo, Alberto (Alberto Crespo Rodas) |title=450 Anos De La Fundación De La Paz |publisher=Canelas |year=1998 |location=Cochabamba, Bolivia |author-link=:es:Alberto Crespo Rodas}}</ref>

Control over the former [[Inca]] lands had been entrusted to [[Pedro de la Gasca]] by the Spanish king (and Holy Roman Emperor) [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]]. Gasca commanded [[Alonso de Mendoza]] to found a new city commemorating the end of the civil wars in Peru; the city of La Paz was founded on 20 October 1548, by Alonzo de Mendoza, with Juan de Vargas appointed as its first mayor.<ref name="Crespo-2">{{Cite book |author=Crespo, Alberto (Alberto Crespo Rodas) |author-link=:es:Alberto Crespo Rodas |year=1980 |title=Alonzo de Mendoza: Fundador de La Paz |location=La Paz, Bolivia |publisher=Biblioteca Popular Boliviana de Última Hora}}</ref>

In 1549, Juan Gutierrez Paniagua was commanded to design an urban plan that would designate sites for public areas, plazas, official buildings, and a cathedral. These were meant to express the ideals and relationships of Spanish colonial society.{{cn|date=September 2024}} La Plaza de los Españoles, which is known today as the Plaza Murillo, was chosen as the location for government buildings as well as the Metropolitan Cathedral.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

[[Spain]] controlled La Paz with a firm grip and the Spanish king had the last word in all matters political, but consultation was extended, taking months or longer by sea. Indigenous and other unrest was repeated around the turn of the nineteenth century.{{cn|date=September 2024}} In 1781, for a total of six months, a group of [[Aymara people]] laid siege to La Paz. Under the leadership of [[Tupac Katari]], they destroyed churches and government property. Thirty years later Indians conducted a two-month siege against La Paz. This incident was the setting for the origin of the legend of the [[Ekeko]]. In 1809, the struggle for independence from the Spanish rule brought uprisings against the royalist forces.{{cn|date=September 2024}} On 16 July 1809, [[Pedro Domingo Murillo]] said that the Bolivian revolution was igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to turn off. This uprising formally marked the beginning of the liberation of South America from Spain. The first open rebellions against the Spanish Crown took place in La Paz and the city of Sucre simultaneously.{{cn|date=September 2024}} This event is known as the Primer Grito Libertario de América and brought about the [[Bolivian War of Independence]].
[[File:La Paz in 1987.jpg|left|thumb|[[Plaza Murillo|Plaza Murrillo]], the city's main square, seen in 1987.]]
Pedro Domingo Murillo was hanged at the Plaza de los Españoles several months later, on 29 January 1810.{{cn|date=September 2024}} After Bolivia gained independence, La Paz named this plaza after him, to commemorate him always. He is remembered as the voice of revolution across South America.

In 1898, La Paz was made the ''[[de facto]]'' seat of the national government, with Sucre remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted [[silver]] [[mining|mines]] of [[Potosí]] to the exploitation of [[tin]] near [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]], and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national [[elite]]s.<ref>"[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761553809/La_Paz.html La Paz]," Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2008.

The [[Racial segregation|segregation]] of [[Chola boliviana|Cholitas]] (women of [[Andean]] indigenous background) continued until the 1980s. They were not allowed to enter certain public places and were banned from cinemas and some restaurants, with more emphasis in Bolivian eastern cities like [[Santa Cruz De La Sierra]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2015/04/10/eps/1428661748_198900.html |title=La rebelión de las cholas |first=Liliana |last=Colanzi |newspaper=El País |date=18 April 2015 |via=elpais.com |access-date=19 February 2023 |archive-date=19 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230219231132/https://elpais.com/elpais/2015/04/10/eps/1428661748_198900.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:La Paz a Illimani - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|La Paz is characterized by its mountainous geography, the snow-capped [[Illimani]] dominates the city's skyline]]
La Paz is in the valleys of the Andes, close to the Eastern split of the Altiplano region. The metropolitan area is near to the Cordillera Real range, which includes such notable mountains as [[Illimani]] (guardian of La Paz), [[Mururata]], [[Huayna Potosi]], [[Chacaltaya]], [[Kunturiri (Los Andes)|Kunturiri]], [[Llamp'u]], [[Chachakumani]], [[Chearoco]], and [[Ancohuma]]. 

La Paz is built in a canyon created by the [[Choqueyapu River]] (now mostly built over), which runs northwest to southeast. The city's main thoroughfare, which roughly follows the river, changes names over its length, but the central tree-lined section running through the downtown core is called the Prado.

The geography of La Paz (in particular the altitude) is marked by social differences. The more affluent residents live in the lower, central areas of the city southwest of the Prado. Many middle-class residents live in high-rise condos near the center. Lower-income residents live in makeshift brick houses in the surrounding hills. The satellite city of El Alto, where the airport is, is spread over a broad area to the west of the canyon, on the Altiplano.

An [[1994 Bolivia earthquake|earthquake in July 1994]] rated at 8.2 struck {{convert|200|mi|0|abbr=out}} north of La Paz.

=== Main neighborhoods and zones ===
; San Jorge: [[File:Vista del barrio de Sopocachi.jpg|thumb|Buildings in [[Sopocachi]], in the district of Cotahuma]]Located in the district known as Cotahuma and near [[Sopocachi]], is one of the main residential and diplomatic areas of the city. San Jorge was one of the most exclusive neighborhoods of La Paz and the financial center of the metropolis, housing international firms like [[Deloitte]], [[Bank of America]], [[Ernst & Young]], [[BBVA]] and the famous [[The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company|Ritz Hotel]]. It is now home of some of Bolivia's tallest building known as Torre Girasoles, Torres del Poeta, and the only [[intelligent building]] of the country, known as Torre Azul. The neighborhood is also populated with expensive offices, renowned restaurants, museums and bookstores. Its Avenida Arce, one of the main streets of the city, is the highest-priced street in the country and the one with the most upscale boutiques in Bolivia. San Jorge is home to the embassies of the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Brazil]], [[Japan]], [[Germany]] and [[Spain]]. The offices of the [[World Bank]], the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], the [[CAF – Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean]], the [[Goethe Institut]], the [[Alliance Française]] and the [[Dante Alighieri Society]] are also located in this modern neighborhood.

; [[Sopocachi]] : Located in the 1st District (Cotahuma), Sopocachi is probably one of the oldest residential neighborhoods, 10 minutes from the center of the city. Despite the expansion and development of the area, this quarter maintained its residential property. In the last years, there has been an important commercial expansion, mainly on the surroundings of Abaroa Square, one of the many squares and parks of the zone.

; San Pedro : Located in the 1st District (Cotahuma), on the right bank of the Choqueyapu River and built around the "Plaza de San Pedro" (official name: Plaza Sucre, ''Sucre Square''), is home to numerous shops, businesses and small enterprises, especially printing, spare parts and auto maintenance and repair shops. San Pedro's "Rodriguez Market" remains as one of the most popular [[middle-class]] and oldest of the city. The [[San Pedro prison]] is here.

[[File:Peatones en el Paseo del Prado.jpg|thumb|The Paseo del Prado, one of the main throughfares in the city]]
; Centro: The city's downtown area, in the 7th District, comprising the center of La Paz and principal roads of the city, like Arce Avenue, 16 July Avenue (also known as "Prado Avenue"), Mariscal Santa Cruz Avenue and Camacho Avenue – the last one being the home of the headquarters of the principal banks and companies of the country.
; Casco Viejo : Located in the 7th District, is the historic and ancient center of La Paz. It now houses museums, hotels, shops and buildings as the Mayor City of La Paz and the [[Central Bank of Bolivia]]. In the Old Quarter is the [[Plaza Murillo]], which is home to the Government Palace and the National Congress.

; Miraflores : In the 7th District, Miraflores district is separated from downtown by a long barrel (''Parque Urbano Central'', "Central Urban Park") and connected by the Bridge of the Americas and two avenues. Originally a residential zone, its growth has led it to become a major recreational center. It houses universities (including the [[Universidad Mayor de San Andrés]]'s faculty of medicine), hospitals and the [[Estadio Hernando Siles]] (capacity of 45,000 people).

; Northern District : Located in the 2nd and 3rd districts, it has a significant industrial activity (mainly food), being the Cervecería Boliviana Nacional (Bolivian National Brewery) the most significant industry founded by Germans, and one of the city's biggest companies in the country. It connects La Paz with the city of El Alto by the ''autopista'' (highway).

; Southern District : [[File:Calacoto La Paz, Bolivia.jpg|thumb|Zona Sur, the southern district is largely the most affluent neighborhood in La Paz.]]In the 5th district; has less height than the rest of La Paz (3,200 to 2,800 meters). It is referenced as the "Macrodistrito Sur" which has 3 districts with an area of 47.8 km2. The population density reached 3,084 inhabitants per squared km. in 2016. Obrajes, Bolognia, Koani, Achumani, San Miguel, Cota Cota, Irpavi, Següencoma, Ovejuyo, Chasquipampa, La Florida and [[Calacoto]] are some neighborhoods that make it up. This city district is the area of greatest expansion and growth, both population and the construction sector in La Paz.<ref>{{cite news |title=Macrodistrito Sur |url=http://sitservicios.lapaz.bo/cartillas/descargas/CARTILLA_SUR.pdf |website=Macrodistrito Sur - GAMLP |date=2016 |access-date=13 March 2023 |archive-date=1 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230601203402/http://sitservicios.lapaz.bo/cartillas/descargas/CARTILLA_SUR.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> This area houses some of the most affluent and exclusive neighborhoods of the city. It has been benefited from steady economic growth and is now the second commercial and financial center of the city, housing international firms like [[Moody's]], [[Citibank]], [[Aon Corporation]], [[Huawei]], [[Millicom]] International Cellular, [[Nissan Motor Corporation]], [[Samsung Electronics]], [[Pan American Silver Corporation]], a [[Sumitomo Corporation]] branch, [[Ernst & Young]], and the "MegaCenter", La Paz's biggest shopping mall.

The city of La Paz has a consistently decreasing volume of colonial buildings, mostly centered around the vicinity of the Plaza Murillo. Due to a lack of funds and the inability of property owners to pay for restorations to colonial buildings, many have been torn down, or are in a dilapidated state. As historic buildings are more expensive to keep, land owners find it less of a burden to construct more modern buildings as opposed to keeping the old ones. Although there has been an increasing number of projects and propositions to restore some of the city's colonial buildings, the future of these historic edifices remains uncertain.

{{Unreferencedsect|date=September 2024}}
The economy of La Paz has improved greatly in recent years,{{when|date=February 2019}} mainly as a result of improved political stability. Due to the long period of high inflation and economic struggle faced by Bolivians in the 1980s and early 1990s, a large informal economy developed. Evidence of this is provided by the markets found all around the city.
While there are stable markets, almost every street in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods has at least one vendor on it.

La Paz remains the principal center of manufacturing enterprises that produce finished-product goods for the country, with about two-thirds of Bolivia's manufacturing located nearby. Historically, industry in Bolivia has been dominated by mineral processing and the preparation of agricultural products. However, in the urban center of La Paz, small plants carry out a large portion of the industry. Food, tobacco products, clothing, various consumer goods, building materials, and agricultural tools are produced. "The tin quotations from London are watched in La Paz with close interest as an index of the country's prosperity; a third of the national revenue and more than half of the total customs in 1925 were derived from tin; in short, that humble but indispensable metal is the hub around which Bolivia's economic life revolves. The tin deposits of Bolivia, second largest in the world, ... invite development."

== Sports ==
[[File:Hernando Siles Stadium - La Paz.jpg|thumb|The [[Estadio Hernando Siles|Hernando Siles Stadium]]]]La Paz is the home of some of the biggest football teams in Bolivia.

* [[Club Bolívar]] : Founded in 1925, it was named in honor of the Libertador [[Simón Bolívar]], the team has won most of the tournaments national and international championships in the last 20 years, and is the largest team, by number of fans, of the country. The year 1964 was a bad year, as it was relegated from the top division, playing the next year in the second division. But it soon returned to the top flight.
* [[The Strongest]] : Founded in 1908 the club hosts some of its games and trains on their home stadium named Rafael Mendoza after Don Rafael Mendoza, one of the most important presidents of the club. In 1968 an airplane accident took the life of almost all the players, but Rafael Mendoza made many efforts that allowed the team to rise again as one of the most important in the country.

* [[La Paz F.C.]] : Founded in 1989, the club quickly rose through the ranks to become the third major club in the capital, only behind in popularity to the two well-established city rivals.

The city is host to several other teams that play in the first and second divisions such as:

* [[Academia de Balompié Boliviano]]
* [[Club Always Ready|Always Ready]]
* [[Chaco Petrolero]]
* [[Club 31 de Octubre]]
* [[Deportivo Municipal de La Paz]]
* [[Fraternidad Tigres]]
* [[Mariscal Braun]]
* [[Universitario de La Paz]]
* Club Unión Maestranza

With the exception of Deportivo Municipal and Unión Maestranza, all the other teams play the majority of their games in the city stadium, the [[Estadio Hernando Siles]], which also hosts the [[Bolivia national football team|national football team]] and international games. Always Ready frequently play at the [[Estadio Rafael Mendoza]] which belongs to The Strongest, who rarely use the stadium due to its relatively small capacity.

The city is connected by road with the city of [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]] from where there are routes to Sucre, [[Potosí]] and the south of the country. Another highway branches off before Oruro to reach [[Cochabamba]] and [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra|Santa Cruz]]. Roads to the west go to [[Copacabana, Bolivia|Copacabana]] and [[Tiwanaku]], near [[Lake Titicaca]], and continue to [[Cuzco]], Peru via the border town of [[Desaguadero (Bolivia)|Desaguadero]]. There are also roads north to get to [[Yungas]] crossing the [[Andes Mountains]].

Departures to smaller cities and towns within the department use informal stations located in Villa Fátima (departures to Los Yungas, [[Department of Beni|Beni]] and [[Department of Pando|Pando]]), Upper San Pedro (for [[Apolo (La Paz)|Apolo]]) and near the General Cemetery (for Copacabana, Lake Titicaca, or via Tiwanaku to Desaguadero on the Peruvian border).

=== Cable car system ===

{{Main|Mi Teleférico}}
[[File:14-Teleférico-La-Paz-nX-2.jpg|thumb|The [[Mi Teleférico]] transit network is the largest aerial cable car urban transit system in the world.]]
A system of urban transit [[Gondola lift|aerial cable cars]] called Mi Teleférico ("My Cable Car") was opened in 2014. Eight lines are in operation, and three more lines are in the planning stage. The initial three lines were built by the [[Austria]]n company [[Doppelmayr Garaventa Group|Doppelmayr]]. The first two lines (Red and Yellow) connected La Paz with [[El Alto]]. All stations have both a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] name and an [[Aymara language|Aymara]] name.

== Water supply ==
[[File:La Paz from Above.jpg|thumb|La Paz gets its main water supply from nearby lakes fed by the glaciers of the Andes Mountains]]
The [[water supply]] of La Paz is threatened by the impact of [[climate change]] through the melting of glaciers. The city receives its drinking water from three water systems: El Alto, Achachicala and Pampahasi. La Paz shares the first and largest of these systems with its sister city [[El Alto, La Paz|El Alto]]. All three systems are fed by glaciers and rivers in the [[Cordillera Real (Bolivia)|Cordillera]] mountain range. 20-28 % of its water is fed by glaciers, the remainder coming from rainfall and snowmelt. The glaciers recede as a result of climate change, initially increasing water availability during the dry season, but ultimately threatening a substantial decrease in dry season run-off when they completely disappear. A small glacier, the [[Chacaltaya]] near El Alto, already disappeared in 2008. The El Alto system receives its water from the Tuni Dam and two water channels. These channels divert water that flows from the Zongo Glacier on the slopes of [[Huayna Potosi]] and from [[Kunturiri (La Paz)|Condoriri]] North of El Alto.<ref name="SEI" /> The 2.9&nbsp;km long Zongo glacier retreats at a rate of about 18 meters per year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Zongo Glacier retreat |url=https://glacierchange.wordpress.com/2009/12/13/zongo-glacier-retreat/ |access-date=10 March 2015 |date=13 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223055718/https://glacierchange.wordpress.com/2009/12/13/zongo-glacier-retreat/ |archive-date=23 December 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The Tuni and Condoriri glaciers have lost 39% of their area between 1983 and 2006. According to a study by the [[Stockholm Environment Institute]] (SEI), the El Alto system is the least resilient against the impact of climate change among the three systems. The study says that reducing water distribution losses is the most effective short-term strategy to deal with [[water scarcity]].<ref name=SEI>{{cite web |author1=Nick Buxton |author2=Maria Escobar |author3=David Pureky |author4=Nilo Lima |title=Water scarcity, climate change and Bolivia: Planning for climate uncertainties |url=https://glacierchange.wordpress.com/ |publisher=Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) |access-date=10 March 2015 |date=2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326084159/https://glacierchange.wordpress.com/ |archive-date=26 March 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Shukman |first=David |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8394324.stm |title=Glacier threat to Bolivia capital |work=BBC News |date=4 December 2009 |access-date=31 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210051724/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8394324.stm |archive-date=10 December 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref> New water sources further to the North in the Cordillera include the Khara Kota and Taypicacha, but they are expensive to develop and their water supply is also affected by glacier melt.
