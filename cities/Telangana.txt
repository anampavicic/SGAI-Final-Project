== Etymology ==
One popular etymology derives the word "Telangana" from ''[[Trilinga Kshetras|Trilinga desha]]'' ("land of three [[lingam|lingas]]"), a region named after 3 important [[Shaivite]] shrines present in it: [[Kaleshwaram]] (present day Telangana), [[Srisailam]] and [[Draksharama]] (present day [[Andhra Pradesh]]).<ref>{{cite book |author=Phillip B.

According to [[Jayadheer Tirumala Rao]], a scholar of history, the name Telangana is of [[Gondi language|Gondi]] origin. Rao asserts that it is derived from "Telangadh", which means "south" in Gondi and has been referred in "Gond script dating back to about 2000 years".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Akbar |first1=Syed |last2=Mungara |first2=Sunil |date= 13 December 2017 |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/earliest-reference-to-telangana-found-not-in-telugu-but-gond-language/articleshow/62046296.cms|title=Earliest reference to Telangana found not in Telugu, but Gond language |work=[[The Times of India]] |access-date=13 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213235534/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/earliest-reference-to-telangana-found-not-in-telugu-but-gond-language/articleshow/62046296.cms |archive-date=13 December 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

One of the earliest uses of a word similar to Telangana can also be seen in a name of [[Malik Maqbul Tilangani]] (14th century CE), who was called the ''Tilangani'', which implies that he was from Telangana. He was the commander of the [[Warangal Fort]] (''Kataka Pāludu'') and later ''[[Vizier|Wazir]]''— Minister under [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Indian elements in the bureaucracy of the Delhi Sultanate|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/11909cf4-3ca5-35a6-943a-90603777e637|page=160|last=Latif|first=Shaikh Abdul|volume=54|year=1993|journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress|format=PDF|access-date=3 September 2023|archive-date=5 October 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231005134859/https://www.jstor.org/stable/11909cf4-3ca5-35a6-943a-90603777e637|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Advanced Study in the History of Medieval India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUk5k5AN54sC&pg=PA224|pages=224–225|last=Mehta|first=Jaswant Lal|volume=3|year=1979|publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt.

A 16th-century travel writer, [[Firishta]], recorded in his book:
<blockquote>During the just reign of [[Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah Wali|Ibrahim Kootb Shah]], ''Tulingana'', like [[Egypt]], became the mart of the whole world. Merchants from Toorkistan, Arabia, and Persia resorted to it; and they met with such encouragement that they found in it inducements to return frequently.

The word "Telinga" changed over time to "Telangana" and the name "Telangana" was designated to distinguish the predominantly Telugu-speaking region of the erstwhile [[Hyderabad State]] from its predominantly [[Marathi language|Marathi]]-speaking one, [[Marathwada]]. It is also called "The land of Telugu people". After [[Asaf Jahi]]'s ceded the Seemandhra region to the British, the rest of the [[Telugu people|Telugu]] region retained the name Telangana and the other parts were called Madras Presidency's Circars and Ceded.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=wWDnTWrz4O8C&pg=PA684 "India Today&nbsp;• An encyclopedia of life in the Republic"&nbsp;• Vol.&nbsp;1.

The historic city [[Golconda]] in Hyderabad established itself as a diamond trading centre, and until the end of the 19th century, the Golconda market was the primary source of the finest and largest diamonds in the world. Thus, the legendary name [[Golconda Diamonds]] became synonymous with Golconda itself.

[[Quli Qutb Mulk]], a governor of Golconda, revolted against the Bahmani Sultanate and established the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty]] in 1518.

During the early seventeenth century a strong cotton-weaving industry existed in Telangana. Large quantities of cotton were produced for domestic and exports consumption. High quality plain and patterned cloth made of muslin and calico was produced.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Moreland|first=T.H.|title=Relation of Golconda in the Early Seventeenth Century|publisher=Halyukt Society|year=1931|pages=XVIII, XIX, XX}}</ref>

In 1712, [[Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asif Jah I|Qamar-ud-din Khan]] was appointed by emperor [[Farrukhsiyar]] as the viceroy of Deccan with the title ''Nizam-ul-Mulk'' (meaning "Administrator of the Realm"). He was later recalled to Delhi, with Mubariz Khan appointed as the viceroy. In 1724, Qamar-ud-din Khan defeated Mubariz Khan to reclaim the ''Deccan suba,'' establishing it as an autonomous province of the Mughal empire. He took the name ''Asif Jah'', starting what came to be known as the [[Asaf Jahi dynasty]].<ref name="brief" /> He named the area [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad Deccan]].

When Asif Jah I died in 1748, there was political unrest due to contention for the throne among his sons, who were aided by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces. In 1769, Hyderabad city became the formal capital of the Nizams. The Nizam [[Nasir-ud-dawlah, Asaf Jah IV]] signed the [[subsidiary alliance]] with the British in 1799 and lost its control over the state's defence and foreign affairs. Hyderabad State became a [[princely state]] among the [[presidencies and provinces of British India]].<ref name="Nizam" />

When [[Independence of India|India became independent]] from the British Empire in 1947, the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] did not want to merge with the Indian Union and wanted to remain independent.

{{Main|Telangana Rebellion}}
The [[Telangana Rebellion]] was a [[List of peasant revolts|peasant revolt]] supported by the [[communist]]s. It originated in the Telangana regions of the [[Hyderabad State]] between 1946 and 1951, led by the [[Communist Party of India]]&nbsp;(CPI).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Elliot |first=Carolyn M. |title=Decline of a Patrimonial Regime: The Telangana Rebellion in India, 1946–51 |journal=Journal of Asian Studies |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=24–47 |date=November 1974 |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/15377979/Decline-of-a-Patrimonial-Regime-The-Telengana-Rebellion-in-India-194651 |doi=10.2307/2052408 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023090101/https://www.scribd.com/doc/15377979/Decline-of-a-Patrimonial-Regime-The-Telengana-Rebellion-in-India-194651 |archive-date=23 October 2012 |jstor=2052408 |s2cid=59483193 }}</ref>

The revolt began in the [[Nalgonda district]] against the [[feudalism|feudal]] lords of [[Reddy]] and [[Velama (caste)|Velama]] castes. It quickly spread to the [[Warangal district|Warangal]] and [[Bidar district|Bidar]] districts. Peasant farmers and labourers revolted against the local feudal landlords (''[[jagir]]dars'' and ''[[deshmukh]]s'') and later against [[Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII|the Nizam Osman Ali Khan]].

It covers {{convert|112077|km2}}.<ref name=stats /> The region is drained by two major rivers, with about 79% of the [[Godavari River]] catchment area and about 69% of the [[Krishna River]] catchment area, but most of the land is arid.<ref name="stats">{{cite web |title=Administrative and Geographical Profile |url=https://www.telangana.gov.in/About/State-Profile |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214053810/https://www.telangana.gov.in/About/State-Profile |archive-date=14 February 2015 |access-date=14 July 2014 |publisher=Telangana State Portal |format=PDF}}</ref> Telangana is also drained by several minor rivers such as the [[Bhima River|Bhima]], the [[Maner River|Maner]], the [[Manjira River|Manjira]], the [[Musi River (India)|Musi]], and the [[Tungabhadra River|Tungabhadra]].

The annual rainfall is between 900 and 1500mm in northern Telangana and 700 to 900mm in southern Telangana, from the southwest [[monsoon]]s. Telangana contains various soil types, some of which are red sandy loams (Chalaka), Red loamy sands (Dubba), lateritic soils, salt-affected soils, alluvial soils, shallow to medium black soils and very deep black cotton soils.

==== Ecology ====
The [[Central Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests]] ecoregion covers much of the state, including Hyderabad. The characteristic vegetation is woodlands of ''[[Hardwickia binata]]'' and ''[[Albizia amara]]''. Over 80% of the original forest cover has been cleared for agriculture, timber harvesting, or cattle grazing, but large blocks of forest can be found in [[Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve]] and elsewhere.<ref>Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J.

[[File:Hyd Legistative Assembly.jpg|thumb|[[Telangana Legislative Assembly]] building]]
Telangana is governed by a [[parliamentary system]] of [[representative democracy]], a feature the state shares with other Indian states. [[Universal suffrage]] is granted to residents. There are three branches of government.

# [[Executive (government)|Executive authority]] is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the [[Chief Minister of Telangana|Chief Minister]], although the titular head of government is the [[Governor of Telangana|Governor]]. The governor is the [[head of state]] appointed by the [[President of India]]. The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the chief minister by the governor, and the Council of Ministers are appointed by the governor on the advice of the chief minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly.
# The legislature, the [[Telangana Legislative Assembly]] and the [[Telangana Legislative Council]], consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, that are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the speaker or the deputy speaker in the speaker's absence. The Assembly is [[bicameral]] with 119 [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|Members of the Legislative Assembly]] and 40 [[Member of the Legislative Council]]. Terms of office run for five years unless the Assembly is dissolved prior to the completion of the term. The Legislative Council is a permanent body with one-third of members retiring every two years.
# The [[judiciary]] is composed of the [[High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad]] and a system of lower courts.

Auxiliary authorities known as ''[[Panchayati raj|panchayat]]s'', for which local body elections are regularly held, govern local affairs. The state contributes seats to [[Lok Sabha]].

The main political parties in the [[Politics of Telangana|regional politics]] are the [[Bharat Rashtra Samithi]], [[All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen]], [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] and [[Indian National Congress]]. Following the [[2014 Telangana Legislative Assembly election|Telangana Legislative Assembly Election in 2014]], the [[Telangana Rashtra Samithi|Bharat Rashtra Samithi]] under [[Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao]] was elected to power.

The economy of Telangana is mainly driven by agriculture. Two important rivers of
India, the [[Godavari River|Godavari]] and [[Krishna River|Krishna]], flow through the state,
providing irrigation. Farmers in Telangana mainly depend on rain-fed water sources for irrigation. Rice is the major food crop. Other important crops are cotton, sugar cane, mango, and tobacco. Recently, crops used for [[Vegetable fats and oils|vegetable oil]] production such as [[sunflower]] and peanuts have gained favour. There are many multi-state irrigation projects in development, including [[Godavari River Basin Irrigation Projects]] and [[Nagarjuna Sagar Dam]], the world's highest masonry dam.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://agri.ap.nic.in|title=Agriculture dept. of Telangana|access-date=21 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709142554/https://agri.ap.nic.in/|archive-date=9 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="industries">{{cite web|url=https://www.apind.gov.in/indussectors.html|title=Key Sectors of Telangana|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221073936/https://apind.gov.in/indussectors.html|archive-date=21 February 2009}}</ref>

In 2019, environmental anthropologist Andrew Flachs raised concerns regarding the financial and social pressures experienced by small cotton farmers in Telangana after conducting ethnographic research in the area. The GM ([[Genetic engineering|genetically modified]]) seeds he focused on were introduced to combat pests and low yields. Within 10 years, GM cottonseeds, which are solely bred by private breeders, were able to capture more than 90% of the Indian market, which was formerly a public market. The [[privatisation]] of seed brands in formerly public markets has been accompanied by [[pesticide]]s, [[fertiliser]]s, consultations, and [[herbicide]]s which are needed to manage the new [[monoculture]]s. He found that this introduction, however, negatively impacted farmers’ ecological knowledge about seed choices and cotton-plant management.<ref name=":1">Flachs, A., 2019. Planting and performing: Anxiety, aspiration, and "scripts" in Telangana cotton farming. ''American Anthropologist'', ''121''(1), pp.48-61.</ref>

Flachs surveyed farming households about their experiences with GM hybrid cottonseeds from 2012 to 2016. His research initially focused on the agricultural [[Decision-making|decision-making process]] among Telangana cotton farmers in the wake of genetically modified seed market expansion, then later on the concept of ''manci digubadi'' as a script. ''Manci digubadi'' means “good yields,” with a more extended phrasing being “''manci digubadi annakunthunnanu'',” which translates to “I’m hoping for good yields.” The concept of ''manci digubadi,'' as described by Flachs, posits that seed choice should be made based on whether or not it has “good yields,”&nbsp; which is dependent solely on what the individual believes is “good.” Flachs further argues that this script is used in the absence of reliable experiential knowledge in the face of agricultural development and GMOs. This is because, in the pursuit of a good yield, cotton farmers learn little about the seeds they use before they switch to the next promising new brands, some of which have been [[Smuggling|smuggled]] in or bought on the [[black market]]. Marketing, the constant influx of new options, and the fear of missing out on popular seeds also contribute to the high turnover. This high turnover and the resulting lack of experiential knowledge have resulted in cotton farmers unwittingly planting the same type of seed multiple times because they are under different brand names. In contrast to this, farmers adopt and abandon seeds from [[Public sector|public-sector]]-bred crops like rice and [[Heirloom plant|heirloom vegetables]] more slowly so they can rely more on experiential knowledge to make decisions.<ref name=":1" />

Telangana cotton farmers are at risk for debt and suicide caused by agricultural pressures such as unreliable credit, pest problems, and agricultural management uncertainty. Flachs argues that seed choices and the rationalisation behind the choice are central to the agricultural political economy, as seed choice is “the first decision that cotton farmers make and one that they cannot take back.”<ref name=":1" /> Flachs argues that cotton seed choices are driven less by [[economic rationalism]] and more by an aspiration to overcome generational poverty and historical [[Social exclusion|marginalisation]].<ref name=":1" /> Flachs found evidence in his work suggesting that many farmers' seed choices are influenced by the choices of their neighbours or more wealthy landowners. As an example of ''manci digubadi'' being used in place of experiential knowledge, Flachs gives the story of a farmer who had planted the Mahyco company’s Neeraja cottonseed for nine years abandoned that seed in favour of Kaveri’s Jaadoo seed after hearing reports that the Jaadoo seeds had done well in a neighbouring village. Farmers also seek advice from non-household experts such as pesticide shop managers and university extension agents. There is no objective [[Cost–benefit analysis|cost-benefit analysis]] because the costs and benefits are ambiguous due to things variations of factors like weather and pests and farmers having no reliable measure for what constitutes a good yield for cotton.<ref name=":1" />
