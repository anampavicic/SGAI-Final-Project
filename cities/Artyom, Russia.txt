'''Artyom''' ({{lang-rus|Артём|p=ɐrˈtʲɵm}}) is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] in [[Primorsky Krai]], [[Russia]], located in the north of the [[Muravyov-Amursky Peninsula]]. Population: {{ru-census|p2021=109,556|p2010=102,603|p2002=64,145|p1989=68,887}}

==History==
It was founded in 1924<ref name="gr">{{cite book|title=Энциклопедия Города России|year=2003|publisher=Большая Российская Энциклопедия|location=Moscow|isbn=5-7107-7399-9|page=25}}</ref> near the Zybunny pit mine, named after revolutionary [[Fyodor Sergeyev]] who was better known by his nickname ''Artyom''. On October&nbsp;26, 1938, it was granted town status.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} In 2004, the amalgamation of surrounding former [[urban-type settlement]]s of [[Uglovoye, Primorsky Krai|Uglovoye]], [[Zavodskoy, Primorsky Krai|Zavodskoy]], and [[Artyomovsky, Primorsky Krai|Artyomovsky]] into the city saw its official population rise from around&nbsp;60,000 to over&nbsp;100,000.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is, together with five [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|rural localities]], incorporated as '''Artyom [[City of federal subject significance|City Under Krai Jurisdiction]]'''—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Primorsky Krai|districts]].<ref name="Ref130">Law #161-KZ</ref> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], Artyom City Under Krai Jurisdiction is incorporated as '''Artyomovsky Urban Okrug'''.<ref name="PrimorskyKArtyomovskyUO_mun">Law #157-UZ</ref>

==Economy==
Half of the able-bodied population of Artyom is engaged in the production of materials.

Artyom has twenty-nine industrial enterprises, half of which are private. Among the consumer goods produced in the town are [[furniture]], [[chinese ceramics|china]], sewing production. The companies employing the largest number of workers in Artyom are ''Primorskoye Mine Administration'' (3,500&nbsp;people) and ''Artyom-Mebel Furniture Factory'' (1,100&nbsp;people). Fifteen joint ventures have been registered in Artyom.

[[Coal mining]] has always been the basis of the local economy, although the existing [[coal]] reserves have practically been exhausted. The forecasts are that [[transport]] will be the most productive industry for Artyom's economic development.

The [[Vladivostok International Airport]] is located near Artyom, and to the southwest, the [[Uglovoye (airfield)|Uglovoye]] military airfield. The largest Primorsky Krai railway junction is also found here. Annually, 12&nbsp;million tons of cargo pass through Artyom to [[Vladivostok]], and 24&nbsp;million tons to Nakhodka. In 1994, the airport served 500,000&nbsp;passengers. This number represented no more than 28% of its potential.
