The city is named after the [[Vale of Tempe]] in [[Greece]]. Tempe is located in the [[East Valley (Phoenix metropolitan area)|East Valley]] section of [[Phoenix metropolitan area|metropolitan Phoenix]]; it is bordered by [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Guadalupe, Arizona|Guadalupe]] on the west, [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]] and the [[Salt River Pima–Maricopa Indian Community]] on the north, [[Chandler, Arizona|Chandler]] on the south, and [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]] on the east.  Tempe is the location of the main campus of [[Arizona State University]].

==History==
[[File:Tempe, Arizona c1870.jpg|thumb|left|Tempe {{circa|1870}}–1880]]

The [[Hohokam]] lived in this area and built [[canal]]s to support their agriculture. They abandoned their settlements during the 15th century, with a few individuals and families remaining nearby.

[[Fort McDowell, Arizona|Fort McDowell]] was established approximately {{convert|25|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of present downtown Tempe on the upper [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt River]] in 1865 allowing for new towns to be built farther down the Salt River. US military service members and Hispanic workers were hired to grow food and animal feed to supply the fort, and less than a year later, had set up small camps near the river that were the first permanent communities in the Valley after the fall of the Hohokam. (Phoenix was settled shortly afterward, by 1867–68.) The two settlements were 'Hayden's Ferry', named after a ferry service operated by [[Charles T. Hayden]], and '[[San Pablo, Arizona|San Pablo]]', and were located west and east of [[Tempe Butte|Hayden Butte]] respectively. The ferry became the key river crossing in the area. The Tempe Irrigating Canal Company was soon established by William Kirkland and James McKinney to provide water for alfalfa, wheat, barley, oats, and cotton.

Pioneer [[Phillip Darrell Duppa|Darrell Duppa]] is credited with suggesting Tempe's name, adopted in 1879, after comparing the [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt River]] valley near a {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall [[butte]], to the [[Vale of Tempe]] near [[Mount Olympus]] in [[Greece]].<ref name="Blanton2007">{{Cite book |last=Blanton |first=Shirley R. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HUGkeC5lKJIC&pg=PA8 |title=Tempe |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7385-4888-3 |page=8}}</ref>

From its founding in 1871 until 90 years later, Tempe was a [[sundown town]] where African Americans were permitted to work but forced to live elsewhere.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Mark |first=Jay |date=February 21, 2014 |title=Black History More Readily Available with Curator's Book |page=Z10 |work=[[The Arizona Republic]] |location=Tucson, Arizona |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29386164/ |quote=Blacks were slow to settle in Arizona.

In 1885, the [[13th Arizona Territorial Legislature]] chose Tempe for the site of the Territorial Normal School, which became Arizona Normal School, Arizona State Teachers College, Arizona State College and finally [[Arizona State University]].

The Maricopa and Phoenix Railroad, built in 1887, crossed the Salt River at Tempe, linking the town to the nation's growing transportation system. The Tempe Land and Improvement Company was formed to sell lots in the booming town. Tempe became an economic hub for the surrounding agricultural area. The [[Maricopa County Board of Supervisors]] incorporated the town of Tempe in 1894.<ref>{{cite web |title=Timeline |url=https://www.tempe.gov/government/community-services/tempe-history-museum/history-and-research/timeline |website=City of Tempe |access-date=October 24, 2023 |language=en |archive-date=January 30, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240130203034/https://www.tempe.gov/government/community-services/tempe-history-museum/history-and-research/timeline |url-status=live }}</ref>

The completion of [[Roosevelt Dam]] in 1911 guaranteed enough water to meet the growing needs of Valley farmers. On his way to dedicate the dam, former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] applauded the accomplishments of the people of central Arizona and predicted that their towns would be prosperous cities in the future. Less than a year later, Arizona was admitted as the 48th state,<ref>{{Cite news |last=Andrew |first=Glass |date=February 14, 2017 |title=Arizona admitted to the union as the 48th state, Feb. 14, 1912 |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/arizona-admitted-to-the-union-as-the-48th-state-feb-14-1912-234947 |access-date=March 26, 2024 |work=Politico |archive-date=March 26, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240326200926/https://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/arizona-admitted-to-the-union-as-the-48th-state-feb-14-1912-234947 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the Salt River Valley continued to develop.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

On August 30, 1971, Tempe was hit by a rare F2 [[tornado]] that injured 41 people, the most injuries recorded from a tornado in Arizona, and caused damage in upwards of $3 million. One indirect fatality occurred when a man died from a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] during the storm.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hardt |first1=Athia |title=Storm batters family's home into a shell |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/arizona-republic/23258134/ |access-date=October 2, 2023 |work=Arizona Republic |publisher=Central Newspapers Inc. |date=August 31, 1971 |pages=3 |archive-date=October 24, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231024050019/https://www.newspapers.com/article/arizona-republic/23258134/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Narramore |first1=Jen |title=Tempe, AZ F2 Tornado - August 30, 1971 |url=https://www.tornadotalk.com/tempe-az-f2-tornado-august-30-1971/ |website=Tornado Talk |date=August 30, 2019 |access-date=October 2, 2023}}</ref>

In the 20th and 21st centuries, Tempe has expanded as a suburb of Phoenix, and as a center of education and commerce.

==Geography==
Tempe is an [[inner suburb]], located between the core city of Phoenix and the rest of the East Valley. Due to this as well as being the home of the main campus of Arizona State University, Tempe has a fairly dense, urbanized development pattern in the northern part of the city especially in relation to the [[Valley Metro|Valley Metro Line]] . Going south, development becomes less dense, consisting of single-family homes, strip malls and lower-density office parks.

The [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt River]] runs west through the northern part of Tempe; part of the river is dammed in two places to create [[Tempe Town Lake]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the landlocked city has a total area of {{convert|40.2|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|40.1|sqmi|km2}}  is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}}  is water. The total area is 0.32% water, including [[Tempe Town Lake]]. The city of Tempe is bordered by [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]] to the east, [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]] and the [[Salt River Pima–Maricopa Indian Community]] to the north, [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Guadalupe, Arizona|Guadalupe]] to the west, and [[Chandler, Arizona|Chandler]] to the south.

Tempe is generally flat, except for [[Tempe Butte]] or Hayden Butte (generally known as A-Mountain for Arizona State University's "A" logo located on its south face), located next to [[Sun Devil Stadium]], Twin Buttes and Bell Butte on the western edge of Tempe, and the buttes within [[Papago Park]] at northwest corner of Tempe. Elevation ranges from {{convert|1140|ft|m}} at [[Tempe Town Lake]] to {{convert|1495|ft|m}} atop Hayden Butte.

===Climate===
Tempe experiences a  [[desert climate]] with a higher degree of [[diurnal temperature variation]] than neighboring Phoenix.
