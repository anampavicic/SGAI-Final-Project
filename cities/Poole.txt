'''Poole''' ({{IPAc-en|p|uː|l|audio=en-uk-Poole.ogg}}) is a coastal town and seaport on the south coast of England in the [[Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole]] unitary authority area in [[Dorset]], England. The town is {{convert|21|miles|km}} east of [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] and adjoins [[Bournemouth]] to the east. Since 1 April 2019, the local authority is [[Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council]]. The town had an estimated population of 151,500 (mid-2016 census estimates) making it the second-largest town in the ceremonial county of Dorset. Together with [[Bournemouth]] and [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]], the [[conurbation]] has a total population of nearly 400,000.

The settlement dates back to before the [[Iron Age]]. The earliest recorded use of the town's name was in the 12th century when the town began to emerge as an important port, prospering with the introduction of the [[Wool#History|wool trade]]. Later, the town had important trade links with North America and, at its peak during the 18th century, it was one of the busiest ports in Britain. In the [[Second World War]], Poole was one of the main departing points for the [[Normandy landings]].

Poole is a tourist resort, attracting visitors with its large [[Poole Harbour|natural harbour]], history, the [[The Lighthouse (Poole)|Lighthouse]] arts centre and [[Blue Flag beach]]es. The town has a [[Port of Poole|commercial port]] with [[English Channel|cross-Channel]] freight and passenger ferry services, which connect with the [[Channel Islands]] of [[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]], as well as the [[France|French]] port town of [[Saint-Malo]], [[Brittany]].

The headquarters of the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] (RNLI) is in Poole, and the [[Royal Marines]] have a base in the town's harbour. Despite their names, Poole is the home of [[The Arts University Bournemouth]], the [[Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra]] and a significant part of [[Bournemouth University]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Poole}}
[[File:Poole Logboat.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Poole Logboat]], a 2,000-year-old [[dugout canoe]] discovered during dredging works in [[Poole Harbour]]]]

The area around modern Poole has been inhabited for at least the past 2,500&nbsp;years, with nearby [[Christchurch Harbour]] evidencing human activity dating back to the [[Neolithic]] period at [[Hengistbury Head]]. During the 3rd century BC, [[Celtic languages|Celtic-speaking people]] known as the [[Durotriges]]<!--does the source specifically state that it was the Durotriges in the 3rd century BC? It's uncertain when tribal identities emerged--> moved from hilltop settlements at [[Maiden Castle, Dorset|Maiden Castle]] and [[Badbury Rings]] to heathland around the [[River Frome, Dorset|River Frome]] and [[Poole Harbour]].<ref>Cullingford (p.183)</ref><!--the reliance of this source seems questionable; Maiden Castle for example was occupied until the Roman conquest--> The [[Roman Britain|Romans]] landed at Poole<!--this is disputed--> during their [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest of Britain]] in the 1st century and took over an [[Iron Age]] settlement at [[Hamworthy]], an area just west of the modern town centre.<ref>Legg (p.9)</ref> This was used as a supply base for the fortress at Lake Farm, [[Ashington, Dorset|Ashington]] and a settlement at [[Badbury Rings|Vindocladia (Bradbury Rings)]].<ref>{{Cite book |author-link=Wessex Archaeology |url=https://www.wessexarch.co.uk/sites/default/files/72110_Lake%20Farm%2C%20Wimborne%2C%20Dorset.pdf |title=Lake Farm Wimborne, Dorset Archaeological Evaluation and Watching Brief Report |publisher=Wessex Archaeology |publication-date=October 2009 |pages=8}}</ref>

The town's name may have originated around the post-Roman or Anglo-Saxon periods, and seems to have originally applied to the harbour. It is derived from the late [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] or early [[Old English language|Old English]] words ''pol'' meaning a pool or creek.<ref name="Place names">{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of British Place-Names|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/pages/Subjects_and_Titles__2B_05|last=Mills|first=A.D.|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-852758-6}}</ref>

By the middle to late [[Anglo-Saxon]] period, Poole was included in the Kingdom of [[Wessex]]. The settlement was used as a base for fishing and the harbour a place for ships to anchor on their way to the River Frome and the important Anglo-Saxon town of [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]].<ref name="Welcome to Poole1">{{cite web | title = The Story of Poole (Page 1) | publisher = Welcome to Poole | year = 2008 | url = http://www.welcometopoole.co.uk/history/story1.htm | access-date = 20 July 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080622121754/http://www.welcometopoole.co.uk/history/story1.htm | archive-date = 22 June 2008 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Poole experienced two large-scale [[Viking]] invasions during this era: in 876, [[Guthrum]] sailed his fleet through the harbour to attack Wareham, and in 1015, [[Canute the Great|Canute]] began his conquest of England in Poole Harbour, using it as a base to raid and pillage Wessex.<ref>Sydenham (p.69–71)</ref><ref>Legg (p.13)</ref>

Poole established successful commerce with the [[British colonisation of the Americas#British colonies in North America|North American colonies]] in the 16th century, including the important fisheries of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].<ref name="historyof"/> Trade with Newfoundland grew steadily to meet the demand for fish from the Catholic countries of Europe. Poole's share of this trade varied but the most prosperous period started in the early 18th century and lasted until the early 19th century. The trade followed a three-cornered route; ships sailed to Newfoundland with salt and provisions, then carried dried and salted fish to Europe before returning to Poole with wine, olive oil, and salt.<ref name="beamish8">Beamish (p.8–11)</ref> By the early 18th century Poole had more ships trading with North America than any other English port and vast wealth was brought to Poole's merchants.<ref name="phc history">{{cite web | year = 2008 | url = http://www.phc.co.uk/about_history.html | title = The Harbour's History | publisher = Poole Harbour Commissioners | access-date = 30 June 2008 | archive-date = 23 May 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190523224828/https://www.phc.co.uk/about_history.html | url-status = dead }}</ref> This prosperity supported much of the development which now characterises the Old Town where many of the [[medieval]] buildings were replaced with [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] mansions and [[Terraced house|terraced housing]].<ref name="beamish8"/><ref name="cockle">{{cite web | year = 2008 | url = http://www.pooletourism.com/go.php?structureID=pages&keywords=cockle&ref=I483ED26E32D39 | title = Poole Cockle Trail | publisher = Poole Tourism | access-date = 3 September 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110715103454/http://www.pooletourism.com/go.php?structureID=pages&keywords=cockle&ref=I483ED26E32D39 | archive-date = 15 July 2011 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the conclusion of the [[War of 1812]] ended Britain's monopoly over the Newfoundland fisheries and other nations took over services provided by Poole's merchants at a lower cost.

[[File:Poole Quay - geograph.co.uk 636450.jpg|thumb|Poole Quay was the busy centre of the town's maritime trade.]]

The town grew rapidly during the [[Industrial Revolution]] as urbanisation took place and the town became an area of [[Mercantilism|mercantile]] prosperity and overcrowded poverty. At the turn of the 19th century, nine out of ten workers were engaged in harbour activities, but as the century progressed, ships became too large for the shallow harbour and the port lost business to the deepwater ports at [[Liverpool]], [[Southampton]] and [[Plymouth]].<ref name="phc history"/> Poole's first railway station opened in [[Hamworthy railway station|Hamworthy]] in 1847 and later extended to the centre of Poole in 1872, effectively ending the port's busy coastal shipping trade.<ref name="Welcome to Poole4"/> The beaches and landscape of southern Dorset and south-west [[Hampshire]] began to attract tourists during the 19th century and the villages to the east of Poole began to grow and merge until the [[seaside resort]] of [[Bournemouth]] emerged.

==Governance==
{{main|Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole|Poole Borough Council}}
There is one tier of local government covering Poole, at [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority]] level: [[Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council]], which is based at the [[Bournemouth Town Hall|Civic Centre]] in [[Bournemouth]].

===Administrative history===
[[File:Old Town, Poole- Old Guildhall, Market Street (geograph 3911110).jpg|thumb|[[Poole Guildhall]], Market Street: Built 1761 and served as courthouse and meeting place for the borough council until 1932]]
Poole was an [[ancient borough]], which lay within the [[ancient parish]] of [[Canford Magna]]. The borough acquired its first [[municipal charter|charter]] in 1248 from [[William Longespée the Younger|William Longespée]], who was [[lord of the manor]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Charter of William Longespee 1248 |url=http://www.poolehistory.org.uk/node/326637 |website=Poole History Online |publisher=Poole Museum |access-date=30 June 2024}}</ref><ref name=1835commissioners>{{cite book |title=Report of the Commissioners appointed to inquire into the Municipal Corporations in England and Wales: Appendix 2 |date=1835 |pages=1319–1320 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3FTAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1319 |access-date=30 June 2024}}</ref> A [[chapel of ease]] dedicated to [[St James' Church, Poole|St James]] existed at Poole from at least 1142.<ref>{{NHLE|desc=Church of St James, Church Street|num=1217470|grade=II*|access-date=30 June 2024}}</ref> In 1538, the borough was removed from the parish of [[Canford Magna]] to become its own parish, called Poole St James.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Youngs |first1=Frederic |title=Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England: Volume 1 |date=1979 |publisher=Royal Historical Society |location=London |isbn=0901050679 |page=116}}</ref>

In 1568, Poole was given the right to appoint its own [[sheriff]], making it a [[county corporate]], independent from the jurisdiction of the [[Sheriff of Dorset]].<ref name=1835commissioners/>

In 1836, Poole was reformed to become a [[municipal borough]]. As part of that reform, the borough boundaries were enlarged to take in [[Hamworthy]], [[Longfleet]] and [[Parkstone]].{{efn|The parish of Hamworthy, and [[tithing]]s of Longfleet and Parkstone (both in the parish of [[Canford Magna]]) had been added to the [[Poole (UK Parliament constituency)|Poole constituency]] in 1832;<ref>{{cite book |title=Parliamentary Boundaries Act |date=1832 |page=342 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uq0uAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA342 |access-date=30 June 2024}}</ref> the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]] directed that the reformed borough should be enlarged to match the constituency.}}<ref>{{cite book |title=Municipal Corporations Act |date=1835 |page=458 |url=https://archive.org/details/statutesunitedk35britgoog/page/458/mode/2up?q=poole |access-date=30 June 2024}}</ref>

When elected county councils were established in 1889, despite being a county corporate, Poole was not considered large enough for the borough council to take on county council functions.{{efn|The usual threshold adopted for a borough to be made a [[county borough]] was a population of 50,000; at the preceding census of 1881, the borough of Poole's population was 12,310.<ref>{{cite book |title=Census of England and Wales 1881: Volume 1 - Area, Houses, and Population |date=1883 |publisher=Census Office |location=London |page=89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q4RPAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA89 |access-date=30 June 2024}}</ref>}} It was therefore included in the [[Administrative counties of England|administrative county]] of Dorset under the new [[Dorset County Council]]. The borough boundaries were enlarged in 1905 to take in [[Branksome, Dorset|Branksome]], and again in 1931 to absorb Canford Magna.<ref>{{cite web |title=Poole Municipal Borough |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10153037#tab02 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=30 June 2024}}</ref> In 1932 the borough council built itself [[Poole Civic Centre]] on Parkstone Road to serve as its headquarters.<ref>{{NHLE|desc=Former Borough of Poole Municipal Buildings and boundary walls|num=1465200|grade=II}}</ref>

The borough of Poole was reconstituted as a [[non-metropolitan district]] in 1974 under the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. The district kept the same boundaries and its [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]], but there were some changes to the council's responsibilities.<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=si|si=The English Non-metropolitan Districts (Definition) Order 1972|year=1972|number=2039|access-date=29 June 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=District Councils and Boroughs |url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/written-answers/1974/mar/28/district-councils-and-boroughs#S5CV0871P0_19740328_CWA_145 |website=[[Hansard|Parliamentary Debates (Hansard)]] |access-date=4 December 2021 |date=28 March 1974}}</ref>

In 1997, [[Poole Borough Council]] became a unitary authority, taking over the provision of county council functions from Dorset County Council.<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=si|si=The Dorset (Boroughs of Poole and Bournemouth) (Structural Change) Order 1995|year=1995|number=1771|access-date=29 June 2024}}</ref>

The borough of Poole was abolished in 2019, merging with the boroughs of Bournemouth and [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]] to become a new [[non-metropolitan district|local government district]] called [[Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole]], the council of which is a unitary authority.<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=si|si=The Bournemouth, Dorset and Poole (Structural Changes) Order 2018|year=2018|number=648|article=3|access-date=24 June 2024}}</ref> The Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole district remains part of the [[ceremonial county]] of Dorset for the purposes of [[Lord-lieutenant|lieutenancy]].<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=act|act=Lieutenancies Act 1997|year=1997|chapter=23|schedule=1}}</ref>

Since the abolition of Poole Borough Council in 2019, Poole has had [[charter trustees]], being the Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole councillors representing wards in the former borough of Poole. The trustees preserve the town's civic charters and traditions, including appointing one of their number each year to serve as mayor and another to serve as sheriff; these roles are now purely honorary with no practical functions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Poole's Charter Trustees |url=https://www.bcpcouncil.gov.uk/about-the-council/civic-dignitaries/charter-trustees/pooles-charter-trustees |website=Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council |access-date=30 June 2024}}</ref> Poole is one of only fifteen towns and cities across England and Wales which appoint their own sheriff, with Poole's right to do so stemming from its former status as a county corporate.<ref>{{cite web |title=National Association of City and Town Sheriffs of England and Wales |url=https://www.sheriffsofenglandandwales.org/ |access-date=30 June 2024}}</ref>

===Parliamentary representation===
Poole is represented by three parliamentary [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituencies]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]; [[Poole (UK Parliament constituency)|Poole]], [[Mid Dorset and North Poole (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Dorset and North Poole]], and [[Bournemouth West (UK Parliament constituency)|Bournemouth West]]. The borough constituency of [[Poole (UK Parliament constituency)|Poole]] has existed since 1950. Previously the town had been a [[parliamentary borough]], electing two members of parliament from 1455 until 1865 when representation was reduced to one member. In 1885 the constituency was abolished altogether and absorbed into the [[East Dorset (UK Parliament constituency)|East Dorset constituency]] until its reintroduction in 1950.

===Coat of arms===
{{Main|Coat of arms of Poole}}
[[File:Coat of Arms Poole.png|thumb|upright|The [[Coat of arms of Poole|coat of arms]] of the Borough of Poole.]]
The design of the [[coat of arms]] originated in a [[Seal (device)|seal]] from the late 14th century and were recorded by [[Clarenceux King of Arms]] during the [[heraldic visitation]] of Dorset in 1563.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://uk-genealogy.org.uk/england/Dorset/visitations/p6.html | title = Visitation of Dorsetshire | publisher = UK Genealogy Archives | access-date = 3 November 2007 | year = 2007 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070709151722/http://www.uk-genealogy.org.uk/england/Dorset/visitations/p6.html | archive-date = 9 July 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The wavy bars of black and gold represent the sea and the dolphin is a sign of Poole's maritime interests.<ref name="coatarms">{{cite web | year = 2008 | url = http://www.poole.gov.uk/your-council/how-the-council-works/coat-of-arms/ | title = Coat of Arms | publisher = Borough of Poole | access-date = 5 December 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120129042421/http://www.poole.gov.uk/your-council/how-the-council-works/coat-of-arms/ | archive-date = 29 January 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref> The scallop shells are the emblem of [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]] and are associated with his [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela|shrine]] at [[Santiago de Compostela]] – a popular destination for [[Pilgrimage#Christianity|Christian pilgrims]] departing from Poole Harbour in the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name="coatarms"/>

The arms were confirmed by the [[College of Arms]] on 19 June 1948, and at the same time, the crest (a [[mermaid]] supporting an anchor and holding a cannonball) was granted. Following [[Local Government Act 1972|local government reorganisation]] in 1974, the 1948 arms were transferred to Poole Borough Council. In 1976, the council received the grant of [[supporters]] for the coat of arms. The supporters refer to important charters given to the town; to the left is a gold lion holding a long sword representing [[William II Longespée|William Longespee]] who in 1248 granted the town's first charter; on the right is a [[dragon]] derived from the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|Royal Arms]] of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] who granted Poole [[county corporate]] status in 1568. The [[Latin]] [[motto]] – ''Ad Morem Villae De Poole'', means: ''According to the Custom of the Town of Poole'', and derives from the Great Charter of 1568.<ref name="coatarms"/>

==Geography==
Poole is a complex shore of the [[English Channel]]; it lies on the northern and eastern edges of [[Poole Harbour]], {{convert|97|miles|km}} west-southwest of London.<ref>{{Google maps|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Poole/@50.7136254,-1.9899201 |title=Poole |access-date=27 April 2020}}</ref> The oldest part of the town (including the historic Old Town, Poole Quay and the [[Dolphin Shopping Centre]]) lies to the south-east of [[Holes Bay]] on a peninsula jutting into the harbour, although much of the land to the east of the peninsula has been reclaimed from the harbour since the mid-20th century. To the west is [[Upton, Dorset|Upton]] and [[Corfe Mullen]] and across the northern border at the [[River Stour, Dorset|River Stour]] lies [[Wimborne Minster]]. At the eastern edge of Poole, the town abuts Bournemouth and the settlements of [[Kinson]], [[Winton, Dorset|Winton]] and [[Westbourne, Dorset|Westbourne]]. To the south of Poole along the coast lies [[Poole Bay]], which has {{convert|3|miles|km}} of sandy beaches from [[Sandbanks]] in the west to Bournemouth in the east.

'''Urban areas and districts of the town'''<br />
Poole is made up of numerous suburbs and neighbourhoods, many of which developed from villages or [[Hamlet (place)|hamlets]] that were absorbed into Poole as the town grew.<br />

=== Green belt ===
{{Main|South West Hampshire/South East Dorset Green Belt}}
Poole lies at the centre of a [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] region that extends into the wider surrounding counties. It is in place to reduce [[urban sprawl]], prevent the towns in the South East Dorset conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.<ref name="green-belt"/>

Poole has areas of green belt to the north and west of the district, mostly on the fringes of the shared border with the Purbeck and East Dorset districts. These cover landscape features and greenfield facilities including the rivers Stour and [[River Sherford|Sherford]] and their [[floodplains]], the [[Stour Valley Way]], [[Canford Heath]]land, Dunyeats Hill and [[Corfe & Barrow Hills|Corfe and Barrow Hill]] nature reserves, Upton Country Park, [[Pergins Island]], and the Wimborne District Society of Model Engineers miniature railway.

The small communities at Merley, Canford Magna, Oakley and Oakley Hill are separated from the main urban area, and while inset, are not covered by green belt. However, the isolated hamlets of Knighton, Merley Hall and [[Ashington, Dorset|Ashington]] are 'washed over', and development is limited in these locations.<ref name="green-belt">{{cite web|title=Poole Local Plan Review - Draft Green Belt Review|url=http://archive.poole.gov.uk/EasySiteWeb/GatewayLink.aspx?alId=35065|website=poole.gov.uk}}</ref> A specific function of the restrictions is to prevent further urban encroachment towards [[Wimborne Minster]], to help maintain its historic character and surroundings.<ref name="green-belt"/>
