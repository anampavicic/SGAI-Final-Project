== History ==
This town of Rosario was founded by [[Order of Saint Augustine|Augustinian friars]] in 1687.<ref name=":1" /> Don Nicolas Morales served as its first town head as ''[[gobernadorcillo]]''. It originated from the community of the early Christians on the southeastern coast of Batangas (within the vicinity of present-day [[Lobo, Batangas|Lobo]]).<ref name=":2" />

The [[Moro people|Moro]] or pirate raids forced the inhabitants of the settlement to the safety of the ravine and forest on the north-west bank of Kansahayan River—in Hilerang Kawayan—now a barangay in the municipality of [[Taysan]] called Pinagbayanan ({{translation|place that used to be a town or settlement}}). Here the settlement was relocated and was named Rosario. However, at the height of the [[Spanish–Moro conflict|Moro Wars]] in the second half of the 18th century, the vicious Moro raids reached Hilerang Kawayan. In one of their forays the Parish Priest is said to be among those slain.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Taysan, Batangas - Pinagbayanan |url=https://www.taysan.gov.ph/about-us/barangays/pinagbayanan |access-date=2023-12-30 |website=www.taysan.gov.ph |language=en-US}}</ref>

{{stack|float=right|[[File:PadreGarciaChurchjf9806 13.JPG|thumb|Most Holy Rosary Parish Church, first stone church of Rosario situated in ''Lumang Bayan''; the present-day [[Padre Garcia]]]]}}

This town was further moved by the [[Dominican Order|Dominican priests]] and headed farther north holding a [[novena]] and praying the [[rosary]] in the process of their flight.<ref name=":2" /> On the 9th night of the novena, the fleeing inhabitants reached the river bank of Tubig ng Bayan ({{lit|lk=yes|Water of Town}}, a river originating from [[Lipa, Batangas|Lipa]]). Here they finally settled. Living in peace and prosperity, the grateful town's people erected a stone church south of the river bank in honor of their benefactress, the Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Most Holy Rosary Parish |url=http://osjphil.org/parish-15.html |access-date=2023-12-30 |website=osjphil.org}}</ref> The town was named ''Santo Rosario''. Rosario remained in this location for a long time until 1902.

Santo Rosario was razed to the ground during the [[Philippine–American War]]. In the early American military occupation of Santo Rosario, a cavalry officer, Captain Daniel H. Boughton,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Daniel H. Boughton • Cullum's Register • 2887 |url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/America/United_States/Army/USMA/Cullums_Register/2887*.html |access-date=2023-12-30 |website=penelope.uchicago.edu}}</ref> came upon the big spring at the foot of Tombol Hill. He decided to relocate the town west of the spring, where Rosario's population center is now.<ref name=":2" />

{{stack|float=right|[[File:Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary Parish.jpg|thumb|[[Our Lady of the Rosary Parish]] Church, parochial church of present-day Rosario]]}}

Official records show that on June 9, 1902, a council of prominent citizens of the town met under a mango tree beside Tombol Spring.<ref name=":2" /> On the spot they formally organized the municipal government of Rosario. The following assumed the first key positions of the town government:

* Geronimo Carandang (''Presidente'')
* Diego Rosales (''Bise Presidente'')
* Luis Greñas (''Secretario'')
* Leon Magtibay (''Tesorero'')

A wealthy landowner, Don Antonino Luancing donated for the town's public buildings and plaza. Tubig ng Bayan became Lumang Bayan ({{lit|Old Town}}) until it became the municipal seat of Padre Garcia in 1949.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Padre Garcia, Batangas - History |url=https://www.padregarcia.gov.ph/about/history |access-date=2023-12-30 |website=www.padregarcia.gov.ph |language=en-US}}</ref>

Local historians were not unanimous as the exact date of the founding of this town. Certainly it was among those organized by the ecclesiastical authorities after the creation of Batangas as a province in 1581. During the final years of Spanish rule, under the [[Order of Augustinian Recollects|Recollect priests]], Rosario served as the center of civilization in this part of Batangas. It was then originally comprised the whole parts of the municipalities of Lobo (separated on September 27, 1871<ref>{{Cite web |date=2011-02-02 |title=Lobo, Batangas History {{!}} WOWBatangas.com - Ang Official Website ng Batangueño |url=https://www.wowbatangas.com/towns-and-cities/lobo/lobo-batangas-history/ |access-date=2024-04-03 |language=en-US}}</ref>), Taysan (formerly [[Barrio]] Mercedes separated in 1919<ref>{{Cite web |date=2012-08-22 |title=Taysan, Batangas History {{!}} WOWBatangas.com - Ang Official Website ng Batangueño |url=https://www.wowbatangas.com/towns-and-cities/taysan/taysan-batangas-history/ |access-date=2024-04-03 |language=en-US}}</ref>), [[San Juan, Batangas|San Juan]] de Bocboc (formerly Barrio Bolboc separated on December 12, 1848<ref>{{Cite web |title=San Juan, Batangas - Culture and Heritage |url=https://www.sanjuanbatangas.gov.ph/tourism/culture-and-heritage |access-date=2024-04-03 |website=www.sanjuanbatangas.gov.ph |language=en-US}}</ref>), and the entire municipality of Padre Garcia.<ref name=":2" />

It was in this town that [[Miguel Malvar|General Malvar]] agreed to make peace with [[J.

This system was patterned after the resolutions traditionally passed by the [[Sangguniang Bayan]] as part of its organizational plan following the general elections when new members are elected into office for a new term.

Consequently, the barangay cluster arrangement was adopted and served as the framework for [[land use]] development strategies enunciated under the  ''Comprehensive Land Use Plan of Rosario, Batangas for Planning Period 2000–2010 (CLUP)''.<ref name="clup">{{cite book | author= Municipal Land Use Committee |author2=Office of the Municipal Planning and Development Coordinator |date=June 2000 | title=Comprehensive Land Use Plan of Rosario, Batangas for Planning Period: 2000–2010   | publisher = Municipality of Rosario, Batangas, Philippines}}</ref>

[[File:Buchi-buchu with vibrant orange color.jpg|thumb|Buchi-buchi]]

''[[Kalamay]]'' is not just a popular snack in Rosario<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Economic Sector – Official Website of the Province of Batangas |url=https://www.batangas.gov.ph/portal/economic-sector/ |access-date=2023-10-05 |language=en-US}}</ref> but also a vital part of traditional Batangas wedding or ''baysanan'' along with [[Suman (food)|''suman'']]. ''Kalamay'' is usually offered on the latter part of ''baysanan'' called ''dapit''. The sticky rice cake symbolizes strong attachment of the couple to each other and to each other's family.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Del Rosario |first=Katrina |title=13 Filipino Wedding Traditions |url=https://www.brides.com/filipino-wedding-traditions-5086934 |access-date=2023-10-06 |website=Brides |language=en}}</ref> ''Suman'' on the other hand is given during the ''sabugan,'' a part of ''baysanan'' within the wedding reception. The ''ninongs'' and ''ninangs'' or the principal sponsors and even some relatives and friends are called to give cash gifts or ''sabog''. In exchange'','' they receive ''suman'' in a manner that it is seemingly being sold to them''.'' Principal sponsors get to receive a basket of goodies with the ''suman'' in it plus primal cuts of meat collectively called ''sabit''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Siason |first=Jemero |date=2022-09-20 |title=Batangas Couple Goes Viral For Giving Gifts For Their Ninong & Ninang During Wedding |url=https://newspapers.ph/2022/09/batangas-couple-goes-viral-giving-gifts-their-ninong-ninang-during-wedding/ |access-date=2023-10-06 |website=Newspapers |language=en-us}}</ref>

Like any other town in Batangas, other famous delicacies in Rosario includes:
* ''[[Lomi]]'',<ref name=":3" /> a Filipino noodle dish originated in the nearby city of Lipa. Authentic Batangas ''lomi'' uses [[cassava]] starch giving it a thick, glossy, and slimy soup different from other lomi that uses cornstarch. Original Batangas ''lomi'' is only topped with ''[[Ngo_hiang|kikiam]]'', meatballs, and pork liver. You could be creative by including boiled eggs (can be chicken or quail), ''[[Chicharrón#Philippines|chicharon]]'' and other fried meat but strictly no vegetables unlike the variety of ''lomi'' proliferating outside of Batangas<ref>{{Cite web |last=Merano |first=Vanjo |date=2010-08-23 |title=Lomi Recipe |url=https://panlasangpinoy.com/pancit-lomi-recipe/ |access-date=2024-03-10 |website=Panlasang Pinoy |language=en-US}}</ref>
* ''Goto'', in other areas of the Philippines, it is a rice porridge. Gotong Batangas on the other hand is a thin soup dish with beef tripes and other innards. It is accompanied by a mixture of fish sauce, ''[[calamansi]]'', chopped onions, and chili as condiments and could be served with rice separately<ref>{{cite web |last1=Clavecilla |first1=Toogy |title=Batangas Goto Recipe |url=https://www.yummy.ph/recipe/batangas-goto-recipe-a1510-20160912 |website=Yummy.ph |publisher=Summit Media |date=12 September 2016}}</ref>
* ''[[Kaldereta]]ng kambing'', a goat stew dish which is a specialty due to the abundance of goats in Rosario and nearby municipalities. ''[[Papaitan]]'' and ''champeni'' are also popular dishes in the area which are cooked using the innards of the same goat that was prepared for kaldereta
* ''Pupor'', a kind of ''chicharon'' in Batangas fried in its own pork fat similar to the ''pitichan'' of [[Pampanga]], ''pinakupsan'' of the [[Visayas]] or ''tulapo'' particularly in [[Iloilo]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fenix |first1=Mickey |title=Straightforward, Simple Batangas Cuisine |url=https://www.positivelyfilipino.com/magazine/straightforward-simple-batangas-cuisine |website=Positively Filipino |publisher=Positively Filipino LLC |date=4 August 2015}}</ref>
* ''[[Tulingan]]'', though Rosario is a landlocked municipality, Batangas mostly consists of coastal towns like the nearby San Juan and Lobo where they can have access to this fish, popularly braised to perfection. A common practice is frying the braised fish the next day if there are any leftovers<ref>{{Cite web |last=Manalo |first=Lalaine |date=2021-08-02 |title=Sinaing na Tulingan |url=https://www.kawalingpinoy.com/sinaing-na-tulingan/ |access-date=2023-07-11 |website=Kawaling Pinoy |language=en-US}}</ref> making it more flavorful then what's left with the fried fish can be cooked in coconut milk for another day. [[Batangueño]]s are jokingly said to be venting anger on the ''tulingan'' because of this.
* ''Buchi-buchi'', deep fried sweetened cassava known as ''balinghoy''. In Batangas, it is coated in orange wrapper<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-10-05 |title=Batangas Eats {{!}} BUCHI-BUCHI |url=https://www.barako.ph/batangas-eats-buchi-buchi/ |access-date=2023-07-09 |website=BARAKO PH |language=en-US}}</ref> which at first looks like another snack in the Philippines called ''[[Kwek kwek|kwek-kwek]]'' if you are not familiar with the food. It is also different from ''[[Jian dui|buchi]]'' made from glutinous rice and coated with sesame seeds.
* ''[[Panutsa]]'', Batangas version of a sweet delicacy made by crystallizing brown sugar mixed with peanuts. Outside Batangas, the term is referred to the ''[[muscovado]]'' variant; but in Batangas, that variant is called ''[[sangkaka]]''<ref name="batangas-cuisine">{{cite web |last1=Sanchez |first1=Irene |title=What and Where to Buy the Best Pasalubong ala eh Batangas |url=https://yoorekka.com/magazine/tagaytay-southern-luzon/2017/06/20/what-and-where-to-buy-the-best-pasalubong-ala-eh-batangas |website=Yoorekka |publisher=ShoppersGuide Marketing Inc. |date=30 April 2020}}</ref>
* ''[[Kapeng barako]]'', a type of coffee grown mainly in Batangas. It is associated with [[machismo]] due to its high caffeine content and strong flavor thus calling it ''barako'' which means "[[Stud (animal)|stud]]". In line with this, the ''barako'' coffee is one of the symbols of bravery in Batangas along with the ''[[Butterfly knife|balisong]]'', and the Batangueños themselves<ref name="batangas-cuisine" />

=== Penitensyahan ===
Traditions observed during Holy Week in Rosario include pilgrimage to the Grotto and the ascent to Tombol Hill. [[Good Friday]] starts early in the morning with ''Penitensyahan'', a notable procession in Rosario which includes ''higantes''. A more traditional long procession is held at night that features images of Jesus, Mama Mary, and various saints. On [[Easter Sunday]], [[Holy_Week_in_the_Philippines#Salubong|''Salubong'']] and [[Holy_Week_in_the_Philippines#Sayaw_ng_Pagbatì|''Pagbati'']] is performed in front of the parish church.<ref name="about-rosario" /> ''Pagbati in Rosario'' is traditionally composed of three young ladies dancing to the tune of a local brass band.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pagbati in Rosario |url=https://www.philstar.com/nation/2003/04/20/203090/pagbati-rosario |access-date=2023-10-06 |website=Philstar.com}}</ref> They are dressed in white on the actual Easter Sunday dance early in the morning, and clad in a more colorful dress on the Black Saturday rehearsal dance held in the evening. It is accompanied by waving a flag with grace, making sure it would not fall or roll up.
