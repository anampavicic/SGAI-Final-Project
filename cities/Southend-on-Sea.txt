'''Southend-on-Sea''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-SouthendOnSea.ogg|ˌ|s|aʊ|θ|ɛ|n|d| |ɒ|n| |ˈ|s|iː|}}), commonly referred to as '''Southend''' ({{IPAc-en|s|aʊ|ˈ|θ|ɛ|n|d|}}), is a coastal city and [[unitary authorities of England|unitary authority area]] with [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]] in south-eastern [[Essex]], England. It lies on the north side of the [[Thames Estuary]], {{convert|40|mi}} east of central [[London]]. It is bordered to the north by [[Rochford (district)|Rochford]] and to the west by [[Castle Point]]. The city is one of the most densely populated places in the country outside of London. It is home to the longest [[pleasure pier]] in the world, [[Southend Pier]],<ref name="lonely planet">{{cite book |title=England |series=Lonely Planet travel guide |editor-first=David |editor-last=Else |edition=5th |publisher=[[Lonely Planet]] |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-74104-590-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781741045901/page/445 445] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781741045901/page/445 }}</ref> while [[London Southend Airport]] is located to the north of the city centre.

Southend-on-Sea originally consisted of a few fishermen's huts and farm at the southern end of the village of [[Prittlewell]]. In the 1790s, the first buildings around what was to become the High Street of Southend were completed. In the 19th century, Southend's status as a [[seaside resort]] grew after a visit from the [[Princess of Wales]], [[Caroline of Brunswick]], and the construction of both the pier and railway, allowing easier access from London. From the 1960s onwards, the city declined as a holiday destination. After the 1960s, much of the city centre was developed for commerce and retail, and many original structures were lost to redevelopment. As part of its reinvention, Southend became the home of the [[Access (credit card)|Access credit card]], due to its having one of the UK's first [[Electronic switching system|electronic telephone exchanges]]. An annual seafront airshow, which started in 1986 and featured a flypast by [[Concorde]], used to take place each May until 2012.

On 18 October 2021, it was announced that Southend would be granted [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]], in memorial to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Member of Parliament for Southend West, [[David Amess|Sir David Amess]], a long-time supporter of city status for the borough, who was [[Murder of David Amess|murdered]] on 15 October 2021.<ref name=City>{{cite news|date=18 October 2021|title=Sir David Amess: Southend to become a city in honour of MP|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-58956615|access-date=19 October 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=18 October 2021|title=Southend to become city in honour of Sir David Amess|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/18/southend-to-become-city-in-honour-of-sir-david-amess|access-date=19 October 2021|website=The Guardian}}</ref> Southend was granted city status by letters patent dated 26 January 2022.

==History==
===Early history===
Southend was first recorded in 1309 as ''Stratende'', a small piece of land in the Manor of Milton (now known as [[Westcliff-on-Sea]]), within the Parish of [[Prittlewell]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/miltonchalkwellc0000pear/page/n3/mode/1up?q=history+of+%22Southend-on-Sea%22|title=Milton, Chalkwell, and the Crowstone|author=Pearce.

R.|date=1991|isbn=9780900360886|page=3|publisher=Essex County Council }}</ref> Its next recorded mention was  in a will from 1408, where the area south of Prittlewell was called ''Sowthende''.<ref name=Pevsner/> In March 1665, the British naval ship, The London, blew up while moored just of South-end on its was to fight in the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-53013454|title=Coronavirus and Brexit hit bid to save The London shipwreck|website=BBC|date=15 June 2020}}</ref> The hamlet of South-end, a few fishermen's huts and Thames Farm farmhouse stayed this way until the mid 18th century, when in 1758 a large house was built, which by 1764 had become the Ship Inn.<ref name=Smithp1/> The area was further developed by the building of oystermen cottages called Pleasant Row in 1767, and a year later the settlement was recorded in the parishes records for taxation purposes for the first time. The records also recorded a salt works and a lime kiln.<ref name=Smithp1/> A visitor to the settlement in 1780 said ''"not anything in the worth place notice"'', but a year later the first bathing machine was brought to the hamlet.<ref name=Smithp1/> By 1785, the [[Essex Chronicle|''Chelmsford Chronicle'']] were reporting that plans were being contemplated to build a hotel with the plan to make South-end,
{{blockquote|''equal, if not rival any of the watering places to which the genteelest company usually resort; there being nothing wanted but a place of accommodation, where the agreeable distance from the metropolis, and the excellence of the roads, added to the incomparable fineness of the water, have induced so much polite company down these last two summers''<ref name=Smithp1/>}}
Nothing came of the subscription but the Chronicle reported in 1787, ''"Southend is likely to become a place of fashionable resort, and that there are a greater number of genteel families there this season than was ever known before"''.<ref name=Smithp1/> By the end of the decade, the number of bathing machines had increased, the hamlet was recorded as containing the Ship Inn and 25 houses and cottages, and reported visitors such as [[George Cholmondeley, 1st Marquess of Cholmondeley|Lord Cholmondley]].<ref name=Smithp5>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/originsfailureof0000smit/page/3/mode/1up|title=The origins and failure of New South-End|author=Smith, J.

===The start and fail of New South-End===
[[File:Constable - Southend, D.228-1888.jpg|thumb|Southend by John Constable]]
In 1790, the local lord of the Manor of both Prittlewell and Milton (now Westcliff-on-Sea) and landowner Daniel Scratton set aside 35-acres of land at the top of the cliffs to the west of South-end called Grove Field and the Grove.<ref name=Smithp6-14>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/originsfailureof0000smit/page/3/mode/1up|title=The origins and failure of New South-End|author=Smith, J. R.|date=1991|isbn=9780900360886|pages=6–14|publisher=Essex County Council }}</ref> The site was split into three leasehold sites with 99 year leases, with the development called New South-End, and the original settlement being renamed Old South-end. A new road was created that cut through the development, which would later become the High Street.<ref name=Smithp6-14/> The Chelmsford Chronicle wrote at the time,
{{blockquote|''There seems but little doubt of its becoming a place of fashionable resort, and answering the expectations of the proprietors, being only 42 miles from London and two coaches, and the post passes through it three times a week; water carriage is also convenient, being only eight hours sail, with a fair wind, from London''<ref name=Smithp6-14/>}}
Scratton leased the parcels of land to building firm Pratt, Watt & Louden and John Sanderson, an architect, both of Lambeth. Another site was leased from Scratton by Pratt, Watt & Louden for a brick works for the development.<ref name=Smithp6-14/> The first house in Grove Terrace was completed by January 1792 and it was reported that the hotel had been roofed and 60 dwellings had been started on. By the summer two public houses, the Duke of York and the Duke of Clarence had opened.<ref name=Smithp6-14/> However, by September that year [[The Times]] was reporting that the resort was likely to attract the lower and middle classes, not the wealthy clientele that was being aimed at.<ref name=Smithp6-14/> At this time, Pratt, Watt & Louden transferred the lease to Thomas Holland, a builder and solicitor from [[Grays Inn]], however his finances were not sound and he was soon selling off building materials.<ref name=Smithp6-14/> By December 1792, the operators of the Duke of York, brewers Sea and Woollet closed the public house, but by September 1793 it was still in their ownership.<ref name=Smithp6-14/> The Grand Hotel, now known as The Royal Hotel opened on the 1st July 1793, and most of Grove Terrace was available to let.<ref name=Gordon2014/> Later that year New South-End was listed for the first time by the parish for the annual rate, and by the summer of 1794 the Terrace, Grove Terrace, the Mews and Library had finally been completed.<ref name=Smithp6-14/> However, by February 1795, Thomas Holland had been declared bankrupt, and the property he owned was not sold by auction until 1797, with the Heygate family purchasing the buildings. John Sanderson, the other developer was also declared bankrupt, with only Grove House built, and his estate was not sold until 1802, with much of the site still open land.<ref name=Smithp6-14/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vc4HAAAAQAAJ&dq=southend+commercial+industry&pg=PA83|title=Royal Illustrated History of Eastern England|author=A.

===Growth of the town===
Due to the bad transportation links between Southend and London, there was not rapid development during the [[Georgian Era]] as there was in [[Brighton]]. [[Margate]], although further away from London than Southend, offered cheaper boat and stagecoach fares and had more to offer the visitor.<ref name=Smithp21>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/originsfailureof0000smit/page/3/mode/1up|title=The origins and failure of New South-End|author=Smith, J.

The resort first received Royal patronage in 1801 when [[Princess Charlotte of Wales (1796–1817)|Princess Charlotte of Wales]] visited to sea bathe on the order of her physician.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/southendseasideh0000ever/page/10/mode/1up|title=Southend Seaside Holiday|author=Everritt, Sylvia|date=1980|page=10|publisher=Phillimore |isbn=0850333342}}</ref><ref name=benton>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OkgBxak9f9cC&dq=%22The+Machines%22+southend&pg=PA622|title=The History of Rochford Hundred, (together with the Parishes Comprised Within the Union,)|author=Philip Benton|date=1888|page=622|publisher=Unicorn Press |isbn=978-0-9516587-1-0 }}</ref> Her mother, Princess [[Caroline of Brunswick]] stayed at 7-9 The Terrace during 1803, and in 1805 [[Emma, Lady Hamilton|Lady Hamilton]] held a ball in the hotel assembly room in honour of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]].<ref name=Gordon2014>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TQ87AwAAQBAJ&dq=%22princess+caroline%22+southend-on-sea&pg=PT27|title=The Secret History of Southend-on-Sea|author=Gordon.

===Administrative history===
{{see also|County Borough of Southend on Sea}}
Southend's first elected council was a [[Local Board of Health|local board]], which held its first meeting on 29 August 1866.<ref>{{Cite news |date=31 August 1866 |title=Southend |url=https://www.findmypast.co.uk/search-newspapers |access-date=26 May 2023 |work=Chelmsford Chronicle |page=5}}</ref> Prior to that the town was administered by the [[vestry]] for the wider parish of [[Prittlewell]]. The local board district was enlarged in 1877 to cover the whole parish of Prittlewell.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Yearsley |first=Ian |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DB2tCwAAQBAJ&dq=southend+prittlewell+local+board&pg=PT8 |title=Southend in 50 buildings |date=2016 |publisher=Amberley Publishing |isbn=978-1-4456-5189-7 |location=Stroud |access-date=26 May 2023}}</ref>

The town was made a [[municipal borough]] in 1892. In 1897 the borough was enlarged to also include the neighbouring parish of [[Southchurch]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Local Government Board's Provisional Orders Confirmation (No. 7) Act 1897 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Vict/60-61/72/contents/enacted |access-date=3 September 2023 |website=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=The National Archives}}</ref> with further enlargement in 1913 by taking over the area formerly controlled by [[Leigh-on-Sea|Leigh-on-Sea Urban District Council]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5y51D9X44gkC&q=%22leigh-on-sea+urban+district+council%22+1913|title=Southend-on-Sea Municipal Offices|journal=The Municipal Journal|volume=22|date=1913|page=1499}}</ref> In 1914 the enlarged Southend became a [[County Borough of Southend on Sea|county borough]] making it independent from [[Essex County Council]] and a single-tier of local government.<ref name=Everritt25/> The county borough was enlarged in 1933 by the former area of [[Shoeburyness Urban District]] and part of [[Rochford Rural District]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/c/F232245|title=Shoeburyness Urban District Council|website=The National Archives|access-date=29 March 2023}}</ref>

On 1 April 1974, under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], Southend became a district of Essex, with the county council once more providing county-level services to the town. In 1990, Southend was the first local authority to outsource its municipal waste collection to a commercial provider.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Stokes |first1=Raymond G. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaM0AAAAQBAJ&dq=southend+commercial+industry&pg=PA255 |title=The Business of Waste: Great Britain and Germany, 1945 to the Present |last2=Köster |first2=Roman |last3=Sambrook |first3=Stephen C. |date=2013 |isbn=9781107027213 |page=255|publisher=Cambridge University Press }}</ref> However, in 1998 it again became the single tier of local government when it became a [[unitary authority]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bettley |first=James |title=Essex |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-300-11614-4 |editor-last=Pevsner |editor-first=Nikolaus |series=[[Pevsner Architectural Guides: The Buildings of England]] |pages=690–691}}</ref>

Upon receiving city status on 1 March 2022, the council voted to rename itself '[[Southend-on-Sea City Council]]'.<ref name=charles/>

===Coat of Arms and Twinning===
The Latin motto, 'Per Mare Per Ecclesiam', emblazoned on the municipal coat of arms, translates as 'By [the] Sea, By [the] Church', reflecting Southend's position between the church at [[Prittlewell]] and the sea as in the [[River Thames|Thames]] estuary. The city has been twinned with the resort of [[Sopot]] in Poland since 1999<ref name="sopot">{{cite web | url=http://www.southend.gov.uk/info/200410/historic_southend/331/town_twinning | title=Sopot – Southend's Twin Town | work=Southend-on-Sea Borough Council | access-date=18 February 2015}}</ref> and has been developing three-way associations with [[Lake Worth Beach, Florida]].

===Utilities history===
====Electricity====
Southend-on-Sea County Borough Corporation provided the borough with electricity from the early twentieth century up to 1966 from the Southend power station in London Road. Upon [[nationalisation]] of the electricity industry in 1948, ownership passed to the [[British Electricity Authority]] and later to the [[Central Electricity Generating Board]]. Electricity connections to the [[National Grid (Great Britain)|national grid]] rendered the 5.75 [[Watt|megawatt]] (MW) power station redundant. Electricity was generated by diesel engines and by steam obtained from the exhaust gases. The power station closed in 1966 and in its final year of operation it delivered 2,720 [[Kilowatt hour|MWh]] of electricity to the borough.<ref>''CEGB Statistical Yearbook 1965, 1966''.

====Water====
'''Southend Waterworks Company''' was formed by [[Thomas Brassey]] in 1865, initially to provide water for the steam engines on the new railway line that opened in 1856, and to which Brassey was involved with. The company constructed the city's first deep borehole in Milton Road, which would be known as Southend No.1 Well, along with a reservoir to hold 300,000 gallons.<ref name=ews>{{cite web|url=https://essexwatersupply.com/southend-waterworks-company/|title=Southend Waterworks Company|website=Essex Water Supply|date=17 November 2015 |access-date=15 August 2024}}</ref> In 1870, Brassey died, and a limited company was formed to take over the works. In 1879, the Southend Water Bill was passed to incorporate the company to allow it to raise the necessary cash to expand the supply to the growing town, and to be able to charge rates per home based on the properties value.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bGNCAQAAMAAJ&dq=%22southend+water+company%22&pg=PA262|journal=The Journal of Gas Lighting, Water Supply & Sanitary Improvement|title=The Southend Water Bill|volume=33|date=1879|page=268|publisher=Walter King}}</ref> The company created further boreholes in and around Southend, including [[Vange]], where a treatment works was built to soften the water from the five boreholes located in Vange and [[Fobbing]], with a first of its kind lime recovery plant.<ref name=ews/> During 1896, the water supply was tested due to a rising issue with [[Typhoid fever]] in the town.

Southend is served by two lines on the [[National Rail]] network:

* Running from [[Southend Victoria railway station|Southend Victoria]] north out of the city is the [[Shenfield–Southend line]], a branch of the [[Great Eastern Main Line]], operated by [[Abellio Greater Anglia]]. Services operate to [[Liverpool Street station|London Liverpool Street]], via {{rws|Shenfield}}.
* Running from {{rws|Shoeburyness}}, in the east of the borough, is the [[London, Tilbury and Southend line]] operated by [[c2c]]. It runs west through {{rws|Thorpe Bay}}, {{rws|Southend East}}, {{rws|Southend Central}} to [[Fenchurch Street railway station|London Fenchurch Street]], either via {{rws|Benfleet}} and {{rws|Basildon}} or {{rws|Tilbury Town}} and {{rws|Barking}}. Additionally, one service from Southend Central each weekday evening terminates at Liverpool Street.

From 1910 to 1939, the [[London Underground]]'s [[District line]]'s eastbound service ran as far as Southend and Shoeburyness.<ref>{{cite book | title=The story of London's underground | author=John Robert Day, John Reed | edition=9 | year=2005 | publisher=Capital Transport | isbn=978-1-85414-289-4 | page=66 }}</ref>

Besides its main line railway connections, Southend is also the home of two smaller railways. The [[Southend Pier Railway]] provides transport along the length of [[Southend Pier]], whilst the nearby [[Southend Cliff Railway]] provides a connection from the promenade to the cliff top above.<ref name=tht>{{cite web | title = Southend Cliff Railway | publisher = The Heritage Trail | url = http://www.theheritagetrail.co.uk/cliff_trams/southend_cliff_railway.htm | access-date = 15 May 2009  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090607134735/http://www.theheritagetrail.co.uk/cliff_trams/southend_cliff_railway.htm | archive-date = 7 June 2009 }}</ref>

===Roads===
[[File:Arterial road 220608.jpg|thumb|right|A127 Kent Elms looking west]]

Two A-roads connect Southend with London and the rest of the country: the [[A127 road|A127]] (''Southend Arterial Road''), via Basildon and [[Romford]], and the [[A13 road (Great Britain)|A13]], via Thurrock and [[London Docklands]]. Both are major routes; however, within the borough, the A13 is now a single carriageway local single-carriageway route, whereas the A127 is an entirely dual-carriageway. Both connect to the M25 and eventually London.

==Climate==

===Secondary schools===
Southend has a mixture of secondary school offerings. The mainstream secondary schools are mixed-sex comprehensives, including [[Belfairs Academy]]; [[Cecil Jones Academy]]; [[Chase High School]]; [[Southchurch High School]]; [[Shoeburyness High School]] and [[The Eastwood Academy]].

In 2004, Southend retained the [[Grammar schools in the United Kingdom|grammar school system]] and has four such schools: [[Southend High School for Boys]]; [[Southend High School for Girls]]; [[Westcliff High School for Boys]] and [[Westcliff High School for Girls]].

Additionally, there are two single-sex schools assisted by the Roman Catholic Church: [[St Bernard's High School, Westcliff-on-Sea|St Bernard's High School]] (girls) and [[St Thomas More High School]] (boys).

===Higher and further education===
The main higher education provider in Southend is the [[University of Essex]] which has a campus in Elmer Approach, that opened in 2007 and is on the site of the former Odeon cinema.<ref name="independent.co.uk">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/university-of-essex-raising-expectations-on-the-east-coast-794752.html|title=University of Essex: Raising expectations on the east coast|date=13 March 2008|work=The Independent|access-date=2 August 2008|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/5429212.southend-university-plans-backed/|title=Southend: University plans backed|newspaper=Daily Gazette |date=6 January 2005}}</ref> The University has operated from the city since 2003 when they opened a new satellite campus at Princess Caroline House in the High Street.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/5450935.southend-degree-of-fun-by-the-sea/|title=Southend: Degree of fun by the sea|newspaper=Daily Gazette|date=24 July 2003}}</ref> It also operates the East 15 Acting School Southend campus at the Clifftown Theatre.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://clifftowntheatre.co.uk/east-15-acting-schoo/|title=East 15 Acting School|website=Clifftown Theatre|date=23 January 2023 |access-date=29 March 2023}}</ref>

In addition to a number of secondary schools that offer further education, the largest provider is [[South Essex College]] in a purpose-built building in the centre of town. Formerly known as South East Essex College, (and previously Southend Municipal College) the college changed name in January 2010 following a merger with Thurrock and Basildon College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sarfend.co.uk/southendnews/2009/11/south-essex-college-merger-approved.html|title=South Essex College Merger Approved|date=30 November 2009}}</ref>

Additionally there is [[PROCAT]], (an arm of South Essex College) that is based at Progress Road, while learners can travel to [[USP College]] (formerly SEEVIC College) in [[Thundersley]]. The [[East 15 Acting School]], a drama school has its second campus in Southend, while the Southend Adult Community College is in Ambleside Drive. Southend United Futsal & Football Education Scholarship, located at [[Southend United]]'s stadium [[Roots Hall]], provides education for sports scholarships.

===Formation of education in the city===
====Primary education====
The first school in the city opened in [[Prittlewell]] in 1727, after the Reverend Case campaigned for one to be setup. Land was provided by the Lord of the Manor Daniel Scratton in North Street for establishment of a school, and by 1739, Scratton had donated a further 21 acres of land. The school was by subscription of 1d a week, with 16 free places provided, and the remainder of the funding provided by a partial subscription of the parish and collections at St Mary's.<ref name=Burrows>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/southendonseadis00burriala/page/8/mode/1up?q=London+road|title=Southend-on-Sea and district: historical notes|author=Burrows, John William|date=1909|pages=138–145}}</ref> The Parliamentary commission into charities of 1819-37 described the school as ''"The premises consists of a house of lath and plaster, situate in the village near the bridge; it comprises a schoolroom of about 30ft. in length and 20ft. in breadth, and several other rooms which are appropriated to the use of the schoolmaster"''.<ref name=Burrows/>

After Southend became a separate ecclesiastical district in 1842, the church of St. John's the Baptist founded the subscription [[National school (England and Wales)|National School]] in 1855 in Lower Southend.<ref name=Burrows/> By 1876, the Board of Education called for a local board of education be setup and extra places be created. At the time of their report Southend had the following schools providing education for under 12s:
* Prittlewell Church of England - 175 pupils
* British School - 233 pupils
* Miss Felton's Infant School - 7 pupils 
* Grovesnor School - 54 pupils
It was reported that the National School had closed and that Southend required a further 220 places. Many parishioners were against a local school board being setup, but Daniel Scratton was for the development, and by 1877 the Prittlewell School Board was formed.<ref name=Burrows/>

By 1879, a new school was created called the London Road Schools which had places for over 500 pupils, and Prittlewell Church of England school had moved to East Street.<ref name=Burrows/> However, by 1892, with further expansion of Southend, the Brewery Road School (now called Porters Grange) opened, followed by Leigh Road (which would become Hamlet Court County School) in 1897, Southchurch Hall in 1904, Bournemouth Park in 1907 and Chalkwell Park in 1909.<ref name=Burrows/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.porticoacademytrust.co.uk/copy-of-hamstel-junior-school|title=PORTERS GRANGE PRIMARY SCHOOL & NURSERY|website=Portico Academy Trust|access-date=30 June 2024}}</ref> The local board was dissolved by the [[Education Act 1902|Education Act of 1902]] and replaced by the education committee of the council.<ref name=Burrows/>

====Secondary and further education====
The [[Science and Art Department]] formation in 1853 had seen the government push for education in art, science, technology, and design in Britain and Ireland.<ref name="Butterworth">{{cite thesis |last1=Butterworth |first1=Harry |title=The Science and Art Department, 1853–1900 |publisher=University of Sheffield |date=1968 |type=Ph.D. Thesis |url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/12801}}</ref> The movement did not arrive in Southend until 1882 when two evening classes were set up at the London Road Schools for Art and Physiology.<ref name=Burrows/> By 1883 the classes were moved to Clarence Street in a building shared with the council.<ref name=Burrows/>

The Technical Instruction Act of 1889 and 1891 allowed councils to provide evening classes for technical subjects. The [[County Borough of Southend on Sea|local board]] set up the Technical Instruction Committee, and soon classes were started at the council offices in Clarence Road. They were extremely popular, and the following year the newly created Southend Corporation purchased further land in Clarence Road to build a Technical Institute.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/withfuturewithpa0000carm/page/1/mode/1up?q=%22southend+high+school+for+boys%22|title=With future and with past : a history of Southend High School for Boys on the occasion of its centenary|author=Carmichael, Harry|date=1995|page=1|publisher=Southend High School for Boys |isbn=9780952592303}}</ref> In 1895 the foundation stone was laid, but prior to it opening it was decided to also open a day technical school for about 20 pupils, influenced by the Bryce commission of 1894.

The Day Technical School soon outgrew the Clarence Road site, and in 1902 a new building opened at Victoria Circus to host them, the Evening Technical Institute and the School of Art.<ref name="Carmichael, Harry 1995 4"/><ref name="Carmichael, Harry 1995 5"/><ref name=Carmichael6/> In 1907, Essex County Council formed a new Higher Education committee, who decided that education should be split into separate boys and girls schools. In 1912, a foundation stone was laid in Boston Avenue for a new girls school, and a year later the girls left the Day Technical School to the new [[Southend High School for Girls]].<ref name="Carmichael, Harry 1995 13"/> The Day Technical School was renamed as [[Southend High School for Boys]].<ref name="Carmichael, Harry 1995 14"/> In 1914, Southend became a County Borough, taking charge of all education in the town, including the High School, School of Art and the Evening class institute all located still in the same building.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/withfuturewithpa0000carm/page/1/mode/1up?q=%22southend+high+school+for+boys%22|title=With future and with past : a history of Southend High School for Boys on the occasion of its centenary|author=Carmichael, Harry|date=1995|page=17|publisher=Southend High School for Boys |isbn=9780952592303}}</ref> After the war the number of pupils increased, so in 1919 the School of Art moved out of the top floor to make room for the High School, into temporary wooden buildings at the rear of the building.<ref name=Carmichael29>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/withfuturewithpa0000carm/page/1/mode/1up?q=%22southend+high+school+for+boys%22|title=With future and with past : a history of Southend High School for Boys on the occasion of its centenary|author=Carmichael, Harry|date=1995|page=29|publisher=Southend High School for Boys |isbn=9780952592303}}</ref> In 1920, The Commercial School was a co-educational school opened for the town’s rapidly expanding population in Bellsfield, a former large house located on Victoria Avenue.<ref name="Key Information">{{cite web |title=Key Information |url=https://www.whsb.essex.sch.uk/key-information |publisher=Westcliff High School for Boys |access-date=14 November 2023}}</ref> Two years later, the school's name changed from The Commercial School to Westcliff High School, and by 1926, boys attending the school had moved to the school's present site on Kenilworth Gardens, becoming Westcliff High School for Boys. The accompanying girls' school, Westcliff High School for Girls, remained on the Victoria Avenue site until 1930, following their relocation to the same site as Westcliff High School for Boys.<ref name="Key Information"/> The plans for the purchased land at the corner of Victoria Avenue and Carnarvon Road was changed in 1934 when it was decided to use this as the site of a new town hall.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/withfuturewithpa0000carm/page/1/mode/1up?q=%22southend+high+school+for+boys%22|title=With future and with past : a history of Southend High School for Boys on the occasion of its centenary|author=Carmichael, Harry|date=1995|page=30|publisher=Southend High School for Boys |isbn=9780952592303}}</ref>

In 1922, the School of Art grew by adding a School of Architecture<ref name="The White Hall">{{cite web|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1236551?section=official-list-entry|title=The White Hall|website=Historic England|date=1 December 1994}}</ref><ref name="Douglas Niel Martin-Kaye">{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cvVUAAAAMAAJ&q=%22The+White+Hall%22+Southend|title=Douglas Niel Martin-Kaye|journal=Royal Institute of British Architects|date=1954|volume=61|page=250}}</ref> The School of Art would become the nucleus of the newly formed Southend Technical and Commercial School.

The Kursaal was one of the earliest theme parks, opening in 1901. It closed in the 1970s and much of the land was developed as housing. The entrance hall, a listed building, was redeveloped to house a bowling alley operated by [[Megabowl]] and casino in 1998. However the bowling alley closed in 2019 and the casino closed in 2020. The building currently stands unused, and in May 2024, [[The Victorian Society]] listed the Kursaal amongst their 10 at risk sites that need rescuing.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv221grlqero|title=Top 10 'at risk' sites named by Victorian Society|website=BBC|date=29 May 2024}}</ref>
