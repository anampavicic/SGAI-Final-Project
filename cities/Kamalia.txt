Kamalia City is historical city situated on the bank of River Ravi. The history discloses the town was established prior to the times of Alaxender AKA Sikander in local language. Preliminary it was named Kot Kamal in the Honour of most prominent personality Kamal Khan who was the head of Kharal tribe residing in huge number around Kamalia and whole of Sandal Bar.  

==History==
Kamalia is said to be existing even before the [[Alexander the Great]]. The legend suggests that Alexander tried to invade and win the then walled city (which used to exist with a prehistoric name) in the morning when the people of the city opened its gate for a morning walk. Then the city was attacked and captured. But the conqueror moved on to some other places. Since the neighboring city [[Harappa]] is also prehistoric, so it appears that Kamalia must have been part of an ancient civilization which remained untouched from the wrath of the nature. The old buildings amidst the "Iqbal Bazar" at the vantage point of the city, tell the story of a then progressive era.<ref name=Dawn/> 

The 1947 Partition caused the Sikh and Hindu population to migrate from the area with many of their hidden items still being found after ages. Some nobles even donated their properties to the trust of the Government. Government Praim Sati Trust (P.S.T) College is one of those properties; which is the only public (general-subjects) college in Kamalia other than the Government Technical College of Commerce.

High School No. 1 Is One Of The Oldest School In Kamalia Established in 1921 and it stone was laid down by [[Malcolm Hailey, 1st Baron Hailey|Sir William Malcolm Hailey]] on November 9th, 1926. This School is renowned School of District Toba Tek Singh.

A number of archaic and archaeological sites exist in Kamalia including a Shamshan Ghat (Hindu Cremation Site), a Sikh temple and the ancient havelis.

After partition many groups came and settled in Kamalia City, among them there was huge community of Rai titled Rajputs who migrated from Eastern Punjab region from Cities like Jhalandar, Nakodar, Raikot Etc.
