{{Nihongo|'''Akita'''|秋田市|Akita-shi||{{IPA|ja|aꜜki̥ta|IPA}}; {{lit}}"Autumn field City"|lead=yes}}) is the capital and most populous [[Cities of Japan|city]] of [[Akita Prefecture]], [[Japan]], and has been designated a [[Core cities of Japan|core city]] since 1 April 1997. {{As of|2023|08|01}}, the city has an estimated [[population]] of 300,502 persons in 136,628 households<ref name="Population">{{Cite web|url=https://www.city.akita.lg.jp/_res/projects/default_project/_page_/001/003/568/r02-01-02.pdf|title=Akita City official statistics|accessdate=28 April 2023}}</ref> and a [[population density]] of 332 persons per km². The total area of the city is {{convert|906.07|sqkm|sqmi}}.

==History==
The area of present-day Akita was part of ancient [[Dewa Province]], and has been inhabited for thousands of years. The [[Jizōden Site|Jizōden ruins]] within the city limits are a [[major archaeological site]] with artifacts from the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period through the [[Jōmon period|Jōmon]] and [[Yayoi period]]s. During the [[Nara period]], the [[Imperial House of Japan|imperial court]] established [[Akita Castle]] in 733 AD to bring the local [[Emishi]] tribes under its control. The area was ruled by a succession of local [[samurai]] clans in the [[Sengoku period]], before coming under the control of the [[Satake clan]] of [[Kubota Domain]] during the [[Edo period]]. Under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], a [[castle town]] developed around [[Kubota Castle]].

===Meiji and Taishō Eras===
With the start of the [[Meiji period]], Kubota Domain was abolished, and its castle town divided into the towns of Akita and Kubota. Akita Prefecture was established in 1871, and [[Shima Yoshitake]] was named the first governor. Ancient [[Akita District]] was divided into [[Kitaakita District, Akita|Kitaakita]] and [[Minamiakita District, Akita|Minamiakita]] Districts in 1878. Most of Akita town burned down in a great fire on 30 April 1886.

With the establishment of the modern municipalities system on 1 April 1889, the city of Akita was officially established, including former Kubota and Akita towns. The port area was separated into [[Tsuchizaki-Minato Town]], which became part of Minamiakita District. The first city hall was located inside the former Minamiakita District office. In September 1898, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]'s 17th Infantry Regiment was based in Akita. The first public library was opened in 1898, electrification of [[Tsuchizaki]] began in 1901, and [[Akita Station]] was opened in 1902, as well as running water and telephone services in 1907.

The [[Taishō period]] brought further development to Akita with Nippon Oil Corporation developing the nearby Kurokawa Oil Fields in 1914, and a branch of the [[Bank of Japan]] opening in Akita in 1917.

===Shōwa Era===
In 1935, Nippon Kogyo (the forerunner of [[Japan Energy|Jomo]]) began development of the nearby Yabase Oil Fields. [[Akita Bank]] was established in 1941.

War devastated the city on 14 August 1945. During the [[bombing of Akita in World War II|Tsuchizaki air raid]], over 250 people were killed when 134 [[USAAF]] [[B-29 Superfortress]], attacked the city from midnight to the early dawn. A [[Nippon Oil]] [[oil refinery]] in the [[Tsuchizaki Station|Tsuchizaki]] area was targeted.

During the post-war period, the 16th [[National Sports Festival of Japan]] was held in Akita in 1961. During the [[tsunami]] following the [[1983 Sea of Japan earthquake]], three Akita residents were killed.

===Heisei Era===
[[File:Akita City Hall main building 20160509b.jpg|thumb|Akita City Hall]]

On 1 April 1997, Akita was designated as a [[Core cities of Japan|core city]] with increased autonomy. The [[Akita Shinkansen]] began operations the same year. In August 2001, the [[World Games]] were held in Akita, with the opening ceremony held in the [[Soyu Stadium|Yabase Track and Field Stadium]]. In 2004, the city celebrated its 400th anniversary and its beginnings as Kubota Castle town.

On 11 January 2005, the towns of [[Kawabe, Akita|Kawabe]] and [[Yūwa, Akita|Yūwa]] (both from [[Kawabe District, Akita|Kawabe District]]) were merged into Akita. Kawabe District was dissolved as a result of this merger. The location of Akita City Hall did not change, and former Kawabe and Yūwa Town Halls are used as civic centers. The 62nd [[National Sports Festival of Japan]] was held in Akita in 2007.

==Geography==
The city of Akita is located in the coastal plains of central Akita Prefecture, bordered by the [[Sea of Japan]] to the west. The [[Omono River]] runs through the center of the city.

===Demography===
Censuses have been conducted in Akita since as early as 1873.<ref>{{cite book |title=Le Japon à l'exposition universelle de 1878.

===Climate===
Akita belongs to a climatic transition zone [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa'') and is the most populous city having absolute northern extremity of this climate zone within Japan, bordering very closely with the [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfa'') zone, comparable to [[New York City]], USA. Akita is characterized with cold, very snowy, winters, and hot, humid summers. Monthly averages range from {{convert|0.4|C|1}} in January to {{convert|25.0|C|1}} in August. Due to its location near the [[Sea of Japan]] coast, it receives heavy snowfall, with just above {{convert|377|cm|in|0}} per season, with accumulation occurring mostly from December to March. Precipitation is well-distributed and significant throughout the year, but is greater in the latter half. Over two thirds of all days see some precipitation, either rain or snow.
