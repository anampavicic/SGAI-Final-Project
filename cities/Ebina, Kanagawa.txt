==History==
The area of modern Ebina has been settled since prehistoric times, and has a number of remains from the [[Kofun period]]. Ebina became the [[kokufu|provincial capital]] of [[Sagami Province]] in the [[Nara period]], and was the location of the ''kokubunji'', or [[provincial temple]].<ref name="e" /> It was home to the Yokoyama clan, one of the seven warrior clans of the [[Musashi Province|Musashi region]] during the early [[Kamakura period]]. During the [[Edo period]], the lands around Ebina were ''[[tenryō]]'' territory theoretically administered directly by the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]] in [[Edo]]; however, in reality, the area was a patchwork of small fiefs held by various ''[[hatamoto]]'', as well as exclaves under the control of [[Sakura Domain]] and [[Karasuyama Domain]].

After the [[Meiji Restoration]], the area became part of [[Kōza District, Kanagawa|Kōza District]], Kanagawa Prefecture and was administratively divided into Ebina Village and Arima Village on April 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. The area was connected by rail in 1926 via the [[Sagami Railway]] and in 1927 by the [[Odakyu Electric Railway]], leading to an increase in population and a change in status of Ebina from village to town in 1940. In 1955, Arima Village merged into Ebina Town. Ebina was elevated to [[Cities of Japan|city]] status on November 1, 1971. Urban development projects in the 1980s and 1990s have modernized the city center.<ref name="e" />

==Government==
Ebina has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 22 members. Ebina contributes one member to the Kanagawa Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Kanagawa 13th district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].
