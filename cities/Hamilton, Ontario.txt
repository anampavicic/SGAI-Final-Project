Conceived by [[George Hamilton (city founder)|George Hamilton]] when he purchased the [[James Durand|Durand]] farm shortly after the [[War of 1812]], the town of Hamilton became the centre of a densely populated and industrialized region at the west end of [[Lake Ontario]] known as the [[Golden Horseshoe]].<ref name=encyclopedia>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Hamilton |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |date=March 11, 2019 |last=Weaver |first=John C. |publisher=[[Historica Canada]] |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/hamilton |access-date=June 9, 2021 |archive-date=June 17, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210617195810/https://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/hamilton |url-status=live }}</ref> On January 1, 2001, the current boundaries of Hamilton were created through the [[Merger (politics)|amalgamation]] of the original city with other municipalities of the [[Regional Municipality of Hamilton–Wentworth]].<ref name=amalgprovles>{{cite web |url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_99c14c_e.htm#BK6 |title=City of Hamilton Act, 1999 |access-date=January 4, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822061022/http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_99c14c_e.htm#BK6 |archive-date=August 22, 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref> Residents of the city are known as Hamiltonians.<ref name=HAM100>{{cite book |title=The Hamiltonians, 100 Fascinating Lives |first=Margaret |last=Houghton |publisher=James Lorimer & Company Ltd., Publishers |page=[https://archive.org/details/hamiltonians100f0000houg/page/6 6] |year=2003 |isbn=1-55028-804-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/hamiltonians100f0000houg/page/6}}</ref>

Traditionally, the local economy has been led by the steel and heavy manufacturing industries. During the 2010s, a shift toward the service sector occurred, such as health and sciences. Hamilton is home to the [[Royal Botanical Gardens (Ontario)|Royal Botanical Gardens]], the [[Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum]], the [[Bruce Trail]], [[McMaster University]], [[Mohawk College]], and [[Redeemer University]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Hamilton, Ontario}}
In pre-[[New France|colonial]] times, the [[Neutral Nation|Neutral First Nation]] used much of the land. They were gradually driven out by the [[Iroquois|Five (later Six) Nations]] (Iroquois) who were allied with the [[Canada under British Imperial control (1764-1867)|British]] against the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and their French allies.<ref name=canenc/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Warrick |first=Gary |title=The Precontact Iroquoian Occupation of Southern Ontario |journal=Journal of World Prehistory |volume=14 |issue=4 |year=2000 |pages=415–466 |doi=10.1023/A:1011137725917 |jstor=25801165 |s2cid=163183815}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.hamilton.ca/NR/rdonlyres/74782313-5881-435D-A35C-78F0661FE11B/0/WoodburnBridgeClassEAFinalReportAppCStage1Archaeology.pdf |publisher=City of Hamilton |title=Stage 1 Archaeological Assessment: Woodburn Bridge Replacement |year=2014 |access-date=March 6, 2021 |archive-date=September 11, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210911032517/http://www2.hamilton.ca/NR/rdonlyres/74782313-5881-435D-A35C-78F0661FE11B/0/WoodburnBridgeClassEAFinalReportAppCStage1Archaeology.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> The hamlet of [[Westover, Ontario|Westover]] was built in an area that was originally a Seneca Iroquois tribal village, [[Tinawatawa]], which was first visited by the French in September 1699.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.whs.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1920.pdf |title=Eighth Annual Report |year=1920 |page=109 |publisher=Waterloo Historical Society |access-date=March 21, 2021 |quote= |archive-date=May 18, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210518233301/https://www.whs.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1920.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

After the [[American Revolutionary War]], about 10,000 [[United Empire Loyalists]] left the United States to settle in [[Upper Canada]], now southern Ontario. In 1792, the Crown purchased the land on which Hamilton now stands from the [[Mississaugas]] in Treaty 3, also known as the Between the Lakes Purchase.<ref name=ontariotreaties>{{cite web |url=https://www.ontario.ca/page/map-ontario-treaties-and-reserves |title=Map of Ontario treaties and reserves |publisher=Government of Ontario |date=February 22, 2021 |access-date=June 9, 2021 |archive-date=June 3, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210603121855/https://www.ontario.ca/page/map-ontario-treaties-and-reserves |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://mncfn.ca/treaty3/ |title=Between the Lakes Treaty No. 3 (1792) |publisher=[[Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation]] |date=May 28, 2017 |access-date=June 9, 2021 |archive-date=February 10, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220210043018/http://mncfn.ca/treaty3/ |url-status=dead}}</ref> The Crown granted the Loyalists lands from this purchase to encourage settlement in the region.<ref name=encyclopedia/> These new settlers were soon followed by many more Americans, attracted by the availability of inexpensive, arable land.

The town of Hamilton was conceived by [[George Hamilton (city founder)|George Hamilton]] (a son of a [[Queenston]] entrepreneur and founder, [[Robert Hamilton (judge)|Robert Hamilton]]), when he purchased farm holdings of [[James Durand]],<ref name="WEAVER1985">{{cite book |last=Weaver |first=John C. |title=Hamilton: an illustrated history |year=1985 |publisher=James Lorimer & Company, Publishers |pages=15–16 |isbn=0-88862-593-6}}</ref> the local member of the [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada]], shortly after the War of 1812.<ref name="WEAVER1985"/> [[Nathaniel Hughson]], a property owner to the north, cooperated with George Hamilton to prepare a proposal for a courthouse and jail on Hamilton's property. Hamilton offered the land to the crown for the future site. Durand was empowered by Hughson and Hamilton to sell property holdings which later became the site of the town. As he had been instructed, Durand circulated the offers at [[York, Upper Canada|York]] during a session of the Legislative Assembly, which established a new [[Gore District, Upper Canada|Gore District]], of which the Hamilton townsite was a member.<ref name="WEAVER1985"/>

Initially, this town was not the most important centre of the Gore District. An early indication of Hamilton's sudden prosperity occurred in 1816 when it was chosen over [[Ancaster, Ontario]] to be the new Gore District's administrative centre. Another dramatic economic turnabout for Hamilton occurred in 1832 when a canal was finally cut through the outer sand bar that enabled Hamilton to become a major port.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Origin and Development of the Road Network of the Niagara Peninsula, Ontario 1770&ndash;1851 |first=Andrew F. |last=Burghardt |publisher=McMaster University |year=1969}}</ref> A permanent jail was not constructed until 1832, when a cut-stone design was completed on Prince's Square, one of the two squares created in 1816.<ref name="WEAVER1985"/> Subsequently, the first police board and the town limits were defined by statute on February 13, 1833.<ref>''Statutes of Upper Canada, 1833'', 3° William IV, p.&nbsp;58–68.

By 1845, the population was 6,475. In 1846, there were useful roads to many communities as well as stagecoaches and steamboats to Toronto, Queenston, and Niagara. Eleven cargo schooners were owned in Hamilton. Eleven churches were in operation. A reading room provided access to newspapers from other cities and from England and the U.S. In addition to stores of all types, four banks, tradesmen of various types, and sixty-five taverns, industry in the community included three breweries, ten importers of dry goods and groceries, five importers of hardware, two tanneries, three coachmakers, and a marble and a stone works.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Hamilton, Ontario}}
Hamilton is in [[Southern Ontario]] on the western end of the [[Niagara Peninsula]] and wraps around the westernmost part of [[Lake Ontario]]; most of the city, including the downtown section, is on the south shore. Hamilton is in the geographic centre of the [[Golden Horseshoe]]. Its major physical features are Hamilton Harbour, marking the northern limit of the city, and the [[Niagara Escarpment]] running through the middle of the city across its entire breadth, bisecting the city into "upper" and "lower" parts. The maximum high point is 250m (820') above the level of Lake Ontario.<ref name=about>{{cite web |last=Seward |first=Carrie |title=About Hamilton; Physical features |url=http://www.ueyhamilton.ca/ |access-date=January 4, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015210727/http://www.ueyhamilton.ca/ |archive-date=October 15, 2007 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

[[Hamilton Harbour]] is a natural harbour with a large [[sandbar]] called the Beachstrip. This sandbar was deposited during a period of higher lake levels during the last [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]] and extends southeast through the central lower city to the escarpment. Hamilton's deep sea port is accessed by ship canal through the beach strip into the harbour and is traversed by two bridges, the QEW's [[Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway]] and the lower Canal Lift Bridge.<ref name=Bay>{{cite web |title=Burlington Bay/ Beach strip, Hamilton Harbour, Skyway Bridge |url=http://beachvideo.info/ |access-date=January 4, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215084635/http://beachvideo.info/ |archive-date=December 15, 2007 |url-status=live}} (Requires navigation to relevant articles.)</ref><br />

Between 1788 and 1793, the townships at the Head-of-the-Lake were surveyed and named. The area was first known as The Head-of-the-Lake for its location at the western end of Lake Ontario.<ref name=headlake/> John Ryckman, born in Barton township (where present day downtown Hamilton is), described the area in 1803 as he remembered it: "The city in 1803 was all forest. The shores of the bay were difficult to reach or see because they were hidden by a thick, almost impenetrable mass of trees and undergrowth".<ref name=barton2>{{cite web |title=A History of the city of Hamilton |url=http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/200/301/ic/can_digital_collections/cultural_landmarks/hamhist.htm |access-date=January 4, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015225925/http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/200/301/ic/can_digital_collections/cultural_landmarks/hamhist.htm |archive-date=October 15, 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[George Hamilton (city founder)|George Hamilton]], a settler and local politician, established a town site in the northern portion of Barton Township in 1815. He kept several east–west roads which were originally Indian trails, but the north–south streets were on a regular grid pattern. Streets were designated "East" or "West" if they crossed [[James Street (Hamilton, Ontario)|James Street]] or Highway 6. Streets were designated "North" or "South" if they crossed [[King Street (Hamilton, Ontario)|King Street]] or Highway 8.<ref name=HAMBIO1>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Hamilton Biography (Vol I, 1791–1875) |first=Thomas Melville |last=Bailey |publisher=W.L. Griffin Ltd |year=1981}}</ref> The townsite's design, likely conceived in 1816, was commonplace. George Hamilton employed a grid street pattern used in most towns in [[Upper Canada]] and throughout the American frontier. The eighty original lots had frontages of fifty feet; each lot faced a broad street and backed onto a twelve-foot lane. It took at least a decade to sell all the original lots, but the construction of the Burlington Canal in 1823, and a new court-house in 1827 encouraged Hamilton to add more blocks around 1828–9. At this time he included a market square in an effort to draw commercial activity onto his lands, but the town's natural growth occurred to the north of Hamilton's plot.<ref name=Hamilton2>{{cite DCB |last=Weaver |first=John C. |volume=7 |title=Hamilton, George |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/hamilton_george_1788_1836_7E.html}}</ref>

High ''e. coli'' counts are regularly observed through testing by McMaster University near many of Hamilton's waterfalls, sometimes exceeding the provincial limits for recreational water use by as much as 400 times. The storm sewers in upstream neighbourhoods carry polluted runoff from streets and parking lots, as well as occasional raw sewage from sanitary lines that were improperly connected to the storm sewers instead of the separate sanitary sewer system. Notably, in March 2020, it was revealed that as much as 24 billion litres of untreated wastewater has been leaking into the Chedoke creek and Cootes' Paradise areas since at least 2014 due to insufficiencies in the city's sewerage and storm water management systems.<ref>{{Cite news |date=March 9, 2020 |title=Chedoke Creek's sad legacy of abuse: 10 things you didn't know |language=en |work=The Hamilton Spectator |url=https://www.thespec.com/news/hamilton-region/2020/03/09/chedoke-creek-s-sad-legacy-of-abuse.html |access-date=June 23, 2020 |issn=1189-9417 |archive-date=June 26, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200626002908/https://www.thespec.com/news/hamilton-region/2020/03/09/chedoke-creek-s-sad-legacy-of-abuse.html |url-status=dead}}</ref>

While Hamilton is not directly served by intercity rail, the Lakeshore West line does offer an off-peak bus connection and a peak-hours rail connection to [[Aldershot GO Station|Aldershot station]] in [[Burlington, Ontario|Burlington]], which doubles as the [[VIA Rail]] station for both Burlington and Hamilton.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Coronavirus: Hamilton-Toronto GO Transit service impacted amid anticipated ridership drop |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/6682567/coronavirus-go-transit-hamilton-toronto/ |access-date=May 5, 2021 |website=Global News |language=en-CA |archive-date=May 5, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210505140527/https://globalnews.ca/news/6682567/coronavirus-go-transit-hamilton-toronto/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the 1940s, the [[John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport]] was a wartime air force training station. Today, managed by TradePort International Corporation, passenger traffic at the Hamilton terminal has grown from 90,000 in 1996 to approximately 900,000 in 2002 with mostly domestic and vacation destinations in the United States, Mexico and Central America. The airport's mid-term growth target for its passenger service is five million air travellers annually. The airport's air cargo sector has 24–7 operational capability and strategic geographic location, allowing its capacity to increase by 50% since 1996; 91,000&nbsp;[[metric tonnes]] (100,000&nbsp;[[Short ton|tons]]) of cargo passed through the airport in 2002. Courier companies with operations at the airport include [[United Parcel Service]] and Cargojet Canada.<ref name=airport2>{{cite web |title=2009 Annual Report |publisher=John C.

A report by Hemson Consulting identified an opportunity to develop {{convert|1000|ha|acre|-2}} of greenfields (the size of the Royal Botanical Gardens) that could create an estimated 90,000 jobs by 2031. A proposed [[aerotropolis]] industrial park at Highway 6 and 403, has been debated at City Hall for years. Opponents feel the city needs to do more investigation about the cost to taxpayers.<ref name=Airport2>{{cite news |last=McacIntyre |first=Nicole |title=Airport land 'key to future' |newspaper=The Hamilton Spectator |date=April 16, 2007}}</ref>
