'''Petrópolis''' ({{IPA|pt|peˈtɾɔpolis, -pu-|lang}}), also known as '''The Imperial City''', is a [[List of municipalities in Rio de Janeiro|municipality]] in the [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast Region]] of [[Brazil]]. It is located in the state of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], {{convert|68|km}} northeast of the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. According to the 2022 Brazilian census, Petrópolis municipality had a population of 278,881 inhabitants. Besides being the largest and most populous city in the [[:pt:Microrregião Serrana|Fluminense Mountain Region]], the city also has the largest GDP and [[HDI]] in the region.

The town's name ("City of Peter") honors [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], the last [[List of monarchs of Brazil|Emperor of Brazil]], who is entombed there at the [[Cathedral of Petrópolis|Cathedral of Saint Peter of Alcantara]].<ref name="WDL"/> The city was the summer residence of the [[List of monarchs of Brazil|Brazilian Emperors]] and aristocrats in the 19th century, and was the official capital of the [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|state of Rio de Janeiro]] during the [[First Brazilian Republic]], between 1894 and 1902.<ref name="WDL"/>

There are projects to annex Petrópolis again to the [[Greater Rio de Janeiro|Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro]], because it is linked to the capital by political and economic ties and contains one of the state's highest HDIs.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://alerjln1.alerj.rj.gov.br/scpro1115.nsf/e00a7c3c8652b69a83256cca00646ee5/d2e0a27aa0f98ffe83257a210073a6dd?OpenDocument|title = Projeto de Lei Complementar n.º 13/2012 que insere, novamente, Petrópolis na Região Metropolitana do Rio.

Until the 18th century, the region was inhabited by the ''índios coroados'' (crowned Indians), which earned it the Portuguese name of "''Sertão dos Índios Coroados''". It was only with the discovery of gold in [[Minas Gerais]] and the consequent opening of the new way of the mines that passed through Petrópolis in that century that the region began to be occupied by non-Indians.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.petropolis.rj.gov.br/fct/index.php/turismo/conheca-petropolis/historia-de-petropolis.html|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121023225804/http://www.petropolis.rj.gov.br/fct/index.php/turismo/conheca-petropolis/historia-de-petropolis.html|url-status = dead|archive-date = 2012-10-23|title = Prefeitura de Petrópolis}}</ref> The town's origins can be traced to Bernardo Soares de Proença, who between 1722 and 1725 opened an alternative route between Rio de Janeiro and [[Minas Gerais]], across the Serra da Estrela called "''Caminho Novo das Minas''" (New Road to Mines).

===Imperial period===
[[File:Monumento a Dom Pedro II na Praça Dom Pedro II.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II]]]]

While traveling to Minas Gerais along this route in 1822, [[Pedro I of Brazil|Emperor Pedro I]] stayed at a farm owned by a Catholic priest, named Correia, and found the region's climate pleasant. As the priest's sister and heiress refused to sell his property, the Emperor bought the neighboring one, called the Córrego Seco Farm, in 1830. He had his summer palace built there, but never saw it finished, because he stepped down from the throne on April 7, 1831.<ref>[http://www.petropolis.rj.gov.br/index.php?url=http%3A//fctp.petropolis.rj.gov.br/fctp/modules/mastop_publish/%3Ftac%3DA_Funda%25E7%25E3o_de_Petr%25F3polis Home<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Other Brazilian aristocrats eventually followed suit.

His son, [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II]], on March 16, 1843, signed an imperial decree ordering the construction of a settlement (to be formed with the arrival of [[German Brazilians|German immigrants]]) and the construction of the dreamy summer palace on his outlying lands, the cornerstone of which was settled by the Emperor in May 1845, and that was ready in 1847.<ref name="WDL">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/1360/ |title = Emperor Street |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1860–1870 |access-date = 2013-08-24 }}</ref> Conceived by Major Julius Friedrich Koeler, it is considered to be the second planned city in Brazil (after [[Recife]], designed during the Dutch period), being composed of an urban nucleus – the city (now the center), where the Imperial Palace, Public buildings, commerce and services.

From then on, the city became the ''de facto'' capital of the [[Empire of Brazil]] during the summer, with the whole court moving. Large numbers of well-to-do inhabitants of the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]] also spent the summer in Petrópolis to escape the outbreaks of [[yellow fever]]. Emperor Pedro II ruled for 49 years, and remained in Petrópolis for at least forty summers, for up to five months. On 29 September 1857, the town was elevated to the status of a city. In 1861, the first [[Macadam]]ized Highway in Brazil, Estrada União e Indústria, was inaugurated, connecting Petrópolis to the city of [[Juiz de Fora]] in Minas Gerais. In 1883, a railroad arrived at the city on the initiative of the [[Baron of Mauá]]. Also in 1877, the first telephone line in Brazil (and the first outside of the United States) was built, connecting Pedro's summer palace to his farm headquarters.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Even after the establishment of the Republic and the exile of the Imperial family in 1889, the city continued to play a significant role in Brazilian history. It was a frequent choice as a summer residence for Presidents of the republic, who lodged at the [[Palácio Rio Negro]] (Black River Palace). The most frequent of them was [[Getúlio Vargas]], whose stays, during [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]], lasted up to three months.

Between 1894 and 1902, the city was capital of the [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|State of Rio de Janeiro]], replacing [[Niterói]], due to the two [[Revolta da Armada|Navy Revolts]].

==Culture==
[[File:Palácio de Cristal de Petrópolis - vista lateral.jpg|thumb|Crystal Palace]]
The culture of Petrópolis is directly linked to the imperial period of Brazil. Being nicknamed as Imperial City, the city has a large collection of theaters, museums, and palaces that refer to the period. In addition, much of the culture of the city was influenced by the immigration that participated in the formation of the identity of Petrópolis, where the German, Portuguese, Syrian, Lebanese, and Italian groups stand out. Even today the city has the second largest festival of German culture in Brazil, the Bauernfest, only losing to the [[Oktoberfest]] in the south of the country. In addition, festivals are held every year that bring back the culture of other peoples, such as the Serra Serata, in honor of Italian immigration, and Bunka-Sai, a celebration of Japanese culture. The Cultural Foundation promotes every year (since 2009) the Maestro Guerra-Peixe de Cultura Prize, which honors the most outstanding artists and cultural agents during the year; The patron César Guerra-Peixe was an illustrious composer Petropolitan.

===Architecture===
[[File:Hotel Palácio Quitandinha.JPG|thumb|The hotel and former casino [[Palácio Quitandinha]]]]
The city has unique architecture, such as the [[Palácio Quitandinha]], the Petropolitan Academy of Letters, the House Museum of Santos Dumont, the [[Imperial Museum of Brazil]], the Dom Pedro Theater, the ''Casa do Colono Museum,'' and the [[Cathedral of Petrópolis|Cathedral of Saint Peter of Alcantara]]. The palace is the main building of the so-called "historic center", where Koeler Avenue stands out, surrounded by mansions and palaces of the 19th century. The road is perpendicular to the facade of the Cathedral of Saint Peter of Alcantara and, in the other direction, the Ruy Barbosa Square and the façade of the Catholic University.

In the so-called "historic center", there are also buildings such as "''Encantada''" (summer house of Santos Dumont); the Crystal Palace; the Yellow Palace (City Council); the [[Palácio Rio Negro|Rio Negro Palace]], bordering the city hall (Sérgio Fadel Palace); and curious buildings such as the "castelinho" of the self-proclaimed "Duke of Belfort", on the corner of Koeler and Ruy Barbosa Square, or the old house of the Rocha Miranda family, on Avenida Ipiranga – same address of another residence of the same family, in a sixties style. Modern lines are also present in the house of [[Lúcio Costa]], in the neighborhood of Samambaia.

===Theatres===
Petrópolis has 2 theaters. The ''Teatro Dom Pedro'', created in Art Deco style and inaugurated in 1933 by D'Angelo & Cia, is one of the largest in the state. The place was created with different styles, with mythological and futuristic references, making the theater considered an eclectic style, becoming a cultural and artistic reference for Petrópolis. The city also owns the Teatro Santa Cecília, built in 1955, located in Rua Aureliano Coutinho in the center of the city.

===Museums===

Petrópolis has great traditions as an imperial city. For this reason, today it owns one of the most important museums of the history of Brazil, the Imperial Museum. Built between 1845 and 1862 as the summer Palace of the Imperial Family, it has a collection of pieces linked to the [[List of Brazilian monarchs|Brazilian monarchy]], including furniture, documents, works of art, and personal objects belonging to the Imperial Family.
