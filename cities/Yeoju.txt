'''Yeoju''' ({{Korean|hangul=여주}}; {{IPA|ko|jʌ.dʑu}}) is a [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|city]] in [[Gyeonggi]] Province, [[South Korea]]. Yeoju was a county but was raised to the status of a city in September 2013.<ref>{{cite wikisource |script-title=ko:대한민국 경기도 여주군 도농복합형태의 군  등에 관한 법률 |wslanguage=ko}}</ref> Together with the neighboring city of [[Icheon]], it is known as a major center of contemporary South Korean [[ceramic]]s, and hosts the World Ceramic Exposition every year. Other local products of note include [[rice]], [[sweet potato]]es, and yellow [[melon]]s. Yeoju is the birthplace of Korea's last queen, [[Empress Myeongseong]].<ref>[http://www.yj21.net/english/tourism/Relics.jsp?cid=3868&x=29&y=9 ''Birthplace of Empress Myeongseong''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927114921/http://www.yj21.net/english/tourism/Relics.jsp?cid=3868&x=29&y=9 |date=2013-09-27 }}. 2004. Yeoju Website. 25 October 2006.</ref>

Yeoju's institution of higher learning includes [[Yeoju Institute of Technology]]. The [[Jungbu Naeryuk Expressway]] passes through the city.

A city located in the easternmost part of the southeastern part of Gyeonggi-do. It is bordered by Wonju-si, Gangwon-do to the east, Icheon-si to the southwest, Gwangju-si to the west, Yangpyeong-gun to the north, and Chungju-si and Eumseong-gun of Chungcheongbuk-do to the south. On September 23, 2013, Yeoju-gun was promoted to Yeoju-si, and it is currently the most recently promoted city in the country.

==History==
===Early history===
There have been human settlements in the Yeoju area since [[Paleolithic]] times. At the Heunam-ri archaeological site, just southeast of the city proper, fragments of herringbone patterned earthenware pottery, axe heads, and other artifacts have been discovered.<ref>[http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=581267&cid=1589&categoryId=1589 "흔암리"] 네이버 지식백과. 17 November 2013</ref> Further excavations from research teams and accidental findings from construction in the area have continued to reveal the continued human presence through the [[Neolithic]] era up to the beginnings of recorded history.

After becoming Yeoju-gun in 1895 and staying in Wonju in 1924, Seomyeon was incorporated into Yeoju-gun. In 1941, Yeoju-myeon was promoted to Yeoju-eup, and Gaegun-myeon was incorporated into Yangpyeong-gun in 1963.

===Three Kingdoms period and Goryeo dynasty===
Due to its location on the Namhan River. Yeoju was a geographically strategic point for the rulers of the [[Silla]] kingdom. During the reign of [[Pasa of Silla|King Pasa]] 5th ruler of Shilla from 80 to 112 AD, the mountain fortress of Pasaseong-ji was constructed just downriver from Yeoju on Pasa Mountain.<ref>[http://www.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=1456346 "파사산성"] Korea Tourism Site 17 November 2013</ref> The fortress continued to be used in later dynasties, until its importance faded due to the usage of [[Namhansanseong]] became more prevalent.<ref>[http://www.cha.go.kr/korea/heritage/search/Culresult_Db_View.jsp?mc=NS_04_03_01&VdkVgwKey=13,02510000,31 "문화재청"] Cultural Heritage Administration. 17 November 2013</ref> The majority of the 1,800 meter long wall still stands today and can be accessed by hiking trails.

Yeoju is also home to [[Silleuksa]], the only riverside [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple in Korea. Silleuksa was founded in 580 by the monk [[Wonhyo]], one of the leading minds in Korean Buddhist tradition.<ref>[http://yj21.net/english/tourism/Relics.jsp?cid=3869&x=13&y=6 "Silleuksa"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319092752/http://yj21.net/english/tourism/Relics.jsp?cid=3869&x=13&y=6 |date=2014-03-19 }} Yeoju Website 17 November 2013</ref> It is home to a collection of 7 relics as well as a brick-constructed pagoda, one of only several in the country.<ref>[http://silleuksa.org/ "silleuksa.org"] Official Silleuksa Site 17 November 2013</ref>

The ruins of Godal-Saji temple are all that remain of a temple complex that was originally constructed in 764 AD by [[Gyeongdeok of Silla|King Gyeongdeok]], 35th king of Unified Silla.<ref>[http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1061300&cid=200000000&categoryId=200003809. "고달사지"]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 네이버 지식백과. 17 November 2013</ref> During the early years of the [[Goryeo]] dynasty, the complex was frequented and supported by the ruling family but was later burned down during the [[Joseon]] dynasty. Currently there is little left but a few stone stupas and dragon-headed turtles scattered among the foundations. The intricate carvings in these structures, however, are a lasting example of the workmanship of early Goryeo artisans <ref>[http://www.heritagechannel.tv/Photo/EssayView.asp?htmlIdx=7778 "Heritage TV"] Heritage Channel. 17 November 2013</ref>

===Joseon dynasty===
Yeoju continued to be an influence during the Joseon dynasty due to being a major agricultural producer of staple foods such as rice. Throughout the dynasty various laws were passed to increase the agricultural output and improve the quality of the rice which led to Yeoju, as well as its nearby neighbor Icheon becoming central to the industry.<ref>[http://history.yj21.net/Theme/Theme.asp?BC_ID=a0010 "조선시대 여주"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610214753/http://history.yj21.net/Theme/Theme.asp?BC_ID=a0010 |date=2015-06-10 }} Yeoju History. 18 November 2013</ref> Some principal families became influential in Joseon politics, such as the [[Yeoheung Min clan]] and the Yeoheung Yi clan.

The tomb of [[Sejong the Great]], the most influential king in Korean history, was moved to Yeoju from its former location in Seoul in 1469.<ref>Nilsen, R. (2004). <u>Moon Handbooks South Korea</u>, 3rd eds. Avalon Travel Publishing. pp. 295</ref> The tomb continues to be one of the largest tourist attractions for the area.

In 1851, towards the end of the Joseon dynasty, [[Empress Myeongseong]], the last empress of Korea, was born in Yeoju. Her birthplace, Gamgodang, was mostly destroyed during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]], but after the liberation of the country was restored in order to honor her resistance of Japanese rule.<ref>[http://www.empressmyeongseong.kr/ "www.empressmyeongseong.kr"] Myeongseong Website. 18 November 2013</ref>

Because Yeoju had been the birthplace of Empress Myeongseong, Yeoju and the surrounding countryside hosted activity by the [[Righteous Army#During the Japanese occupation (1910–1945)|Righteous Army]] in the years leading up to the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]]. Along with the presence of Righteous Army guerrilla fighters in the area, some local farmers offered their support of the resistance by providing rice and other foodstuffs.<ref>[http://history.yj21.net/Theme/Theme.asp?BC_ID=a0011 "조선후기 개화기"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714144829/http://history.yj21.net/Theme/Theme.asp?BC_ID=a0011 |date=2014-07-14 }} Yeoju History. 18 November 2013</ref>
