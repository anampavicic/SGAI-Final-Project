==Etymology==

The county's name comes from the Maasai word Illwuasin-kishu. The land was the grazing area of the clan. They surrendered the land to the colonial government in the Anglo-Maasai agreement of 1911 and were subsequently pushed towards [[Trans Mara District]]. The plateau that they once occupied was then registered in its Anglicised version, Uasin Gishu.<ref>MORRIS KIRUGA. Daily Nation. How local dialects influenced naming of west Kenya towns. 23 July 2013

</ref>

==History==
In 1903, the area was proposed as a potential Jewish homeland; [[British Uganda Programme]], which was rejected by the Jewish community leaders in the [[Sixth Zionist Congress]]

In 1908, fifty-eight families of [[Afrikaans]]-speaking [[South Africa]]ns settled in the Uasin Gishu plateau. They were followed by sixty more families in 1911 and more later.<ref>Red strangers: the white tribe of Kenya, {{ISBN|1-85725-206-3}}, by Christine Stephanie Nicholls</ref> The town of [[Eldoret]] was established in the midst of the farms they created.
