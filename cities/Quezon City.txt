Quezon]], the [[List of presidents of the Philippines|second]] [[president of the Philippines]].

The city was intended to be the [[Capital of the Philippines|national capital]] of the Philippines that would replace [[Manila]], as the latter was suffering from [[overcrowding]], lack of housing, poor sanitation, and [[traffic congestion]]. To create Quezon City, several barrios were carved out from the towns of [[Caloocan]], [[Marikina]], [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] and [[Pasig]], in addition to the eight vast estates the [[Government of the Philippines|Philippine government]] purchased for this purpose. It was officially proclaimed the national capital on October 12, 1949, and several government departments and institutions moved out of Manila and settled into the new capital city. This necessitated the expansion of the city northward, carving out [[Novaliches]] from Caloocan which divided it into two non-contiguous parts. Several barrios were also taken from [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]] and parts of [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Montalban]]. However, on June 24, 1976, Presidential Decree No. 940 was enacted, which reverted national capital status to Manila while the whole of [[Metro Manila]] was designated as the [[seat of government]].<ref name="qcpubliclibrary.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.qcpubliclibrary.org/downloads/Full_History_Of_QC_Public_Library.pdf|date=November 21, 2006|title=History of Quezon City Public Library|access-date=July 25, 2014 |url-status=usurped|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924083508/http://www.qcpubliclibrary.org/downloads/Full_History_Of_QC_Public_Library.pdf|archive-date=September 24, 2015}}</ref><ref name="GovPH-PD940" /> The city was also chosen as the regional center of [[Southern Tagalog]], which was created in 1965, along with the provinces of [[Quezon]] and [[Aurora (province)|Aurora]], the birthplace of [[Manuel L. Quezon]]; however, its status of regional center became ineffective when the region was divided into [[Calabarzon]] and [[Mimaropa]], through the effect of Executive Order No. 103 in May 2002 under the presidency of [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]], and Aurora was transferred to the authority of [[Central Luzon]], with Southern Tagalog limited to being a cultural-geographic region.<ref name="NSCBGovPH-EO103">{{cite PH act|chamber=EO|number=103, s. 2002|title=Dividing Region IV into Region IV-A and Region IV-B, Transferring the Province of Aurora to Region III and for Other Purposes|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2002/05/17/executive-order-no-103-s-2002/|publisher=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines]]|access-date=March 29, 2016|date=May 17, 2002|quote=SECTION 4.

Quezon City is known for its culture, entertainment industry and media, and is aptly called the "City of Stars". Major broadcasting networks have their headquarters and studios in the city. It is also known for its commerce, education, research, technology, politics, tourism, art and sports. Several national government branches including the [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]], the seat of [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]], call the city home.

Quezon City is a [[Planned community|planned city]]. It covers a total area of {{convert|161.11|sqkm|sp=us}},<ref name="QCHistory" /> making it the largest city in [[Metro Manila]] in terms of land area. It is politically subdivided into [[Legislative districts of Quezon City|Six Congressional Districts]], which represent the city in the Lower House of the [[Congress of the Philippines]]. The city has 142 barangays under the City Government. National government departments and agencies are mostly situated in the first National Government Center (NGC) in Diliman. and the second National Government Center in [[Batasan Hills]], where the Lower House of the Philippine Congress is located. Most of the city's northern part lies at the foothills of the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] [[mountain range]], including the [[La Mesa Watershed Reservation]], the largest watershed in Metro Manila and a designated [[List of protected areas of the Philippines|protected area]].

According to its 2023 estimated census, Quezon City had 3.1 million people in its boundaries, and 93.8 billion dollars in its GDP, and it is the only planned city in the [[National Capital Region (Philippines)|National Capital Region]] of the Philippines.

Before the creation of Quezon City, the land on where it would eventually rise was part of several towns such as [[Caloocan]], [[Marikina|Mariquina (Marikina)]], [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Montalban]] (renamed as Rodriguez), [[Pasig]], [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]], and [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan del Monte]] (renamed as San Juan), all under Manila province and, beginning in 1901, [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]] province.

In the 1930s, Manila's urban problems were apparent and problematic.<ref name="CorruptioninQC">{{cite web |title=Quezon's City: Corruption and contradiction in Manila's prewar suburbia, 1935–1941 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/22505B43861B5BB45FE261C348A1FDDF/S0022463416000497a.pdf/div-class-title-quezon-s-city-corruption-and-contradiction-in-manila-s-prewar-suburbia-1935-1941-div.pdf |last1=Pante |first1=Michael D. |website=Cambridge.org |date=February 2017 |access-date=July 24, 2021 |archive-date=July 24, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210724143103/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/22505B43861B5BB45FE261C348A1FDDF/S0022463416000497a.pdf/div-class-title-quezon-s-city-corruption-and-contradiction-in-manila-s-prewar-suburbia-1935-1941-div.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> It lacked public housing, where thousands of the city's residents lived in congested informal settler communities, especially in the central districts of [[Binondo]], [[Intramuros]], [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]], [[San Nicolas, Manila|San Nicolas]] and [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]].<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> There were also problems with sanitation and traffic congestion.<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> The rise of slums in Manila gave rise to the development of its suburbs outside the city limits in the municipalities of [[Pasay]], [[Mandaluyong|San Felipe Neri]] (renamed as Mandaluyong), [[San Francisco del Monte]], [[Makati]], and [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan del Monte]].<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> These towns became favorable to the upper and middle-class who wanted to escape the congested city but had economic links to it.<ref name="CorruptioninQC" />

[[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Manuel L. Quezon]], aware of the problems besetting Manila, initiated housing projects called ''Barrio Obrero'' (''Worker's Community'').<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> These communities were established in various places in Manila such as [[Rizal Avenue|Avenida Rizal]], [[Santa Cruz, Manila|Sta. Cruz]] and Barrio Vitas, [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]].<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> However, the project failed miserably and these communities became slum areas.<ref name="CorruptioninQC" />

Alejandro Roces Sr., a prominent Filipino author, was said to be influential in Quezon's vision to establish a new city.<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> Quezon dreamed of a city where the common people could live and thrive.<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> Roces suggested that a sizeable tract of land be purchased for this purpose.<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> However, the government had no available fund except for {{Philippine peso|3 million|link=yes}} in the hands of the National Development Company (NDC).<ref name="CorruptioninQC" />

In order to make Quezon's dream a reality and to mobilize funds for the land purchase, the People's Homesite Corporation (PHC) was created on October 14, 1938, as a subsidiary of NDC, with an initial capital of {{Philippine peso|2 million|link=yes}}.<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> Roces was the chairman of the Board of PHC, and they immediately acquired the vast Diliman Estate of the Tuason family at a cost of 5 centavos per square meter.<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> PHC conducted topographical and subdivision surveys, and then subdivided the lots and sold them to the target buyers at an affordable price.<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> Its target users and beneficiaries were Manila's working class,<ref>{{cite book |title=A Capital City at the Margins: Quezon City and Urbanization in the Twentieth-Century Philippines |url=https://www.academia.edu/40371139 |last1=Pante |first1=Michael |date=January 2019 |publisher=Academia |access-date=August 7, 2021 |archive-date=August 26, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240826165212/https://www.academia.edu/40371139 |url-status=live }}</ref> who were suffering from a shortage of affordable and decent housing in the capital.<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> The service of the Metropolitan Waterworks system was extended to site.<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> The Bureau of Public Works, then under Secretary Vicente Fragante, constructed the streets and highways within the property.<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> Quezon also tapped Architect [[Juan M.

[[File:UP Quezon Hall (Diliman, Quezon City)(2019-04-29).jpg|thumb|left|The transfer of the [[University of the Philippines]] from Manila to Diliman was a precedent for the creation of Quezon City.]]

As early as 1928, the University of the Philippines (UP) had planned to expand by adding more academic units and constructing new buildings.<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> The university experienced increase in enrollment and its planned expansion was hampered by its small campus in Manila.<ref>{{cite web |title=University of the Philippines Diliman History |url=https://upd.edu.ph/history2/ |publisher=University of the Philippines Diliman |access-date=July 24, 2021 |archive-date=August 26, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240826165128/https://upd.edu.ph/history2/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The revised [[Burnham Plan of Manila]] envisioned the new campus to be located just outside Manila's city limits at 'the heights behind Manila'.<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> The UP Board of Regents informed Quezon of their desire to relocate the campus and he was supportive of the idea.<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> Furthermore, he wanted the facilities in the Manila campus to be used for government purposes.<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> In 1939, Quezon urged the National Assembly to enact UP's relocation and on June 8, 1939, Commonwealth Act No. 442 was passed, enacting the transfer of UP outside of Manila.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=442|title=An Act to Direct the Transfer of the University of the Philippines to a Site Outside the City of Manila, Appropriating Funds Therefor |date=June 3, 1939 |url=https://thecorpusjuris.com/legislative/commonwealth-acts/ca-no-442.php |publisher=The Corpus Juris |access-date=August 7, 2021}}</ref> A portion of Mariquina Estate, which was adjacent to Magdalena Estate, was chosen as the new site with an approximate area of 600 hectares.<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> Additional land from the Diliman Estate was also added as part of the new university campus.<ref name="CorruptioninQC" />

With the development of the People's Homesite Corporation housing in the Diliman Estate and the creation of the new UP Campus, the creation of Quezon City was justified.<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> On October 12, 1939, Commonwealth Act No. 502, also known as the Charter of Quezon City, was passed by the National Assembly, which created Quezon City.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=CA|number=502|title=An Act to Create Quezon City|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1939/10/12/commonwealth-act-no-502/|access-date=August 8, 2022|date=October 12, 1939|publisher=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines]]|archive-date=March 8, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230308195829/https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1939/10/12/commonwealth-act-no-502/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Surprisingly, Quezon allowed the bill to lapse into law because he did not sign it.<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> The city was originally to be known as Balintawak City according to the first bill filed by Assemblyman Ramon P.

1939, the year the city was established, recorded a population of 39,103 people. The city in its early days was predominantly rural, but Quezon asked American Architect William Parsons to craft a master plan for the newly created city.<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> Parsons was the one who advise Quezon to locate the National Government Center in Diliman instead of Wallace Field (now [[Rizal Park]]), due to the possibility of naval bombardment from [[Manila Bay]].<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> Unfortunately, he died in December 1939 and his partner Harry T. Frost took over and become the lead planner.<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> Frost arrived in the Philippines on May 1, 1940, and became the architectural adviser of the Philippine Commonwealth government.<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> Together with [[Juan M. Arellano]], Alpheus D.

To make the city accessible, Quezon ordered Luzon Bus Lines to ply from Kamuning towards [[Tutuban Center|Tutuban]] in [[Divisoria]], Manila to provide transport for the city's residents. However, the fare was not affordable to minimum wage earners. Because of the city's unaffordable housing prices and lack of transportation for low-income earners, the goal of creating mass housing for the working class was not met. Instead, those who opted to live in Quezon City consisted of middle-class households such as those in Kamuning, whose residents petitioned to rename it from ''Barrio Obrero'' (Worker's Community) to Kamuning (a type of tree that grows abundantly in the area) because its residents were not ''Obreros'' (Workers).<ref name="CorruptioninQC" />

===Japanese occupation era===

The Philippine Exposition in 1941 was held on the newly established Quezon City, but participants were limited to locals because of the increasing turbulence at the beginning of the Second World War.<ref name="CorruptioninQC" /> Eventually, parts of Manila were bombed by the Japanese Imperial Forces in December 1941, bringing the war to the Philippines. On January 1, 1942, President Quezon issued Executive Order No. 400 as an emergency measure to form the [[City of Greater Manila]], with [[Jorge B. Vargas]] as its designated mayor. It merged the city with Manila and the towns of [[Caloocan]], [[Makati]], [[Mandaluyong]], [[Parañaque]], [[Pasay]], and [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]].

After [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japanese]] forces conquered the Philippines during the [[Pacific War]], the City of Greater Manila was reorganized in 1942 into twelve districts, two of which were formed by dividing Quezon City: Balintawak which consisted of San Francisco del Monte, Galas, La Loma, New Manila, Santa Mesa Estate, the [[Wack Wack Golf and Country Club]], and the present-day [[Greenhills, San Juan]]; and Diliman which was composed of Diliman proper, Cubao, the University District, and the present-day eastern portion of Marikina.<ref>{{cite map |author =  |title = Map of the City of Manila |trans-title =  |map =  |map-url =  |date =  |year = 1942 |url = https://assets.isu.pub/document-structure/210327135441-504a42fce9e9c0dafe948e678988e3b0/v1/68eac8a829832842ad677a95008f9037.jpg |scale = 1:40,000 |series =  |publisher = Division of Drafting and Surveys, Office of the City Engineer and Architect, City of Manila |cartography =  |page =  |pages =  |section =  |sections =  |inset =  |edition =  |location =  |language =  |format =  |isbn =  |id =  |access-date = August 24, 2022 |archive-date = March 8, 2023 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20230308195828/https://assets.isu.pub/document-structure/210327135441-504a42fce9e9c0dafe948e678988e3b0/v1/68eac8a829832842ad677a95008f9037.jpg |url-status = live }}</ref> In the same year, the patients of [[Quezon Institute]] were relocated to the San Juan de Dios Hospital in Intramuros and the Japanese military used the facility for its own sick and wounded.

Heavy fighting occurred in [[Novaliches]], which at that time was within Caloocan, and New Manila which had been fortified. Smaller actions were fought at Barrio Talipapa and the University District.

Students from these Quezon City schools, representing a spectrum of positions, were thus at the front lines of the major protests of the first three months of 1970 – what would later be called the "[[First Quarter Storm]]." A year later in 1971, this was followed up by the [[Diliman Commune]], in which the students, faculty, and residents of [[University of the Philippines Diliman|UP Diliman]] initially planned to protest an impending oil price hike, but because of violent attempts to disperse them, also later demanded that Marcos' military pledge not to assault the campus in the future.<ref name="Daroy1988"/>

Marcos' declaration of [[Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos|martial law]] in September 1972 saw the immediate shutdown of all media not approved by Marcos, including Quezon City media outlets such as [[DZBB-TV|GMA Channel 7]] and [[DWWX-TV|ABS-CBN Channel 2]]. At the same time, it saw the arrest of many students, journalists, academics, and politicians who were considered political threats to Marcos, many of them residents of Quezon City. By the morning after Marcos' televised announcement of the proclamation, about 400 of these arrestees were gathered in [[Camp Crame]] on the southwestern reaches of Quezon City, destined to be among the first of thousands of [[political detainees under the Marcos dictatorship]].<ref name="Daroy1988"/>

Camp Crame would be the site of many of the [[human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship]], with one of the first being the murder of student journalist [[Liliosa Hilao]] in Camp Crame.<ref name=Inquirer04172017>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/718061/liliosa-hilao-first-martial-law-detainee-killed|title=Liliosa Hilao: First Martial Law detainee killed|first=Kate Pedroso, Marielle|last=Medina|date=September 2015}}</ref> Among the prominent cases of abuse suffered specifically by Quezon City residents were the cases of [[Primitivo Mijares]] and his sixteen-year-old son Boyet Mijares, who lived in Project 6 at the time of their deaths;<ref name="MijaresDisappearance">{{Cite news |last=Zamora |first=Fe |date=February 19, 2017 |title=Family secret: How Primitivo Mijares disappeared |language=en |work=INQUIRER.net |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/872907/family-secret-how-primitivo-mijares-disappeared |url-status=live |access-date=May 22, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711125110/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/872907/family-secret-how-primitivo-mijares-disappeared |archive-date=July 11, 2018}}</ref> and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cubao]] social worker [[Purificacion Pedro]] who was murdered by a soldier at her hospital room in Bataan.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Story of Puri|publisher=Schoenstatt Editions USA|year=2022|isbn=9781594380921}}</ref>

One of the key moments that led to the eventual demise of the Marcos dictatorship was the [[1974 Sacred Heart Novitiate raid]], in which a Catholic seminary in [[Novaliches]] was raided on the suspicion that communist leaders were hiding there. The arrest of Fr. Benigno Mayo who was the head of the Jesuit order in the Philippines at the time, and Fr. Jose Blanco alongside 21 members of the youth group called Student Catholic Action (SCA), helped convince "[[Middle force opposition to the Marcos dictatorship|the formerly neutral Philippine middle class]]" that Marcos' powers had grown too great.<ref name="ThompsonStruggle">{{Cite book |last=Thompson |first=Mark R. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44741565 |title=The anti-Marcos struggle : personalistic rule and democratic transition in the Philippines |date=1996 |publisher=New Day |isbn=971-10-0992-7 |location=Quezon City, Philippines |oclc=44741565 |access-date=January 16, 2024 |archive-date=August 26, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240826165143/https://search.worldcat.org/title/44741565 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/773372348 |title=Socdem : Filipino social democracy in a time of turmoil and transition, 1965-1995 |date=2011 |publisher=Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung |isbn=978-971-535-033-4 |location=Pasig City, Metro Manila |oclc=773372348}}</ref>

As international pressure forced Marcos to start restoring civil rights, other key moments in Philippine history took place in Quezon City. Journalist [[Joe Burgos]] established the Quezon City-based [[WE Forum]] newspaper in 1977 and in it published a story by Colonel [[Bonifacio Gillego]] in November 1982 which discredited many of the [[Marcos medals]].<ref name="PamelaHollie19821208">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/08/world/manila-newspaper-closed-by-marcos.html |title=Manila Newspaper Closed by Marcos |last=Hollie |first=Pamela G. |date=1982-12-08 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2019-01-28 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331 |archive-date=November 3, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231103010046/https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/08/world/manila-newspaper-closed-by-marcos.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Media coverage of the [[September 1984 Welcome Rotonda protest dispersal]] showed how opposition figures including 80-year-old former Senator [[Lorenzo Tañada]] and 71-year old Manila Times founder [[Chino Roces]] were waterhosed despite their frailty and how student leader [[Fidel Nemenzo]] (later Chancellor of the University of the Philippines Diliman) was shot nearly to death.

Most significantly, the August 1983 funeral of [[Assassination of Ninoy Aquino|assassinated]] opposition leader of [[Ninoy Aquino]] began at the Aquino family household in Times Street, West Triangle, Quezon City, and continued to the funeral mass at Santo Domingo Church in Santa Mesa Heights before the final interment at the [[Manila Memorial Park]]. The procession took from 9:00 AM until 9:00 PM to finish as two million people joined the crowd. The experience galvanized many of the Philippines into resisting the dictatorship, with protests against Marcos snowballing until they happened nearly every week, and until Marcos was ousted by the [[People Power revolution]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/blogs/opinions/08/24/14/ninoy%E2%80%99s-funeral-was-day-filipinos-stopped-being-afraid-dictators|title=Ninoy's funeral was the day Filipinos stopped being afraid of dictators|first=Raissa|last=Robles|date=August 25, 2014|accessdate=May 31, 2021|website=ABS-CBN News|archive-date=June 2, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210602213143/https://news.abs-cbn.com/blogs/opinions/08/24/14/ninoy%E2%80%99s-funeral-was-day-filipinos-stopped-being-afraid-dictators|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==== Physical and administrative changes during the Marcos administration ====
In terms of administrative changes during this period, the region of Metro Manila was created as an integrated unit with the enactment of Presidential Decree No. 824 on November 7, 1975. The region encompassed four [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]] and thirteen adjoining [[Municipalities of the Philippines|towns]], as a separate regional unit of government.<ref name="GovPH-PD824">{{cite PH act|chamber=PD|number=824|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1975/pd_824_1975.html|title=Creating the Metropolitan Manila and the Metropolitan Manila Commission and for Other Purposes|date=November 7, 1975|access-date=April 21, 2020|publisher=The Lawphil Project - Arellano Law Foundation, Inc.|archive-date=March 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312121648/http://lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1975/pd_824_1975.html|url-status=live}}</ref> A year later, on June 24, 1976, Manila was reinstated by President Marcos as the capital of the Philippines for its historical significance as the seat of government since the Spanish Period.

On May 1, 2001, numerous residents of Barangay Holy Spirit who have been protesting against the arrest of former president [[Joseph Estrada]] marched from [[EDSA Shrine]] to [[Malacañang]] and participated in the [[EDSA III|May 1 riots]] against President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nocum|first1=Armand N.|last2=Aning|first2=Jerome|last3=Veridiano|first3=Dave|title=Gloria: I feel great... but I got scared|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zaU2AAAAIBAJ&pg=PA16|access-date=April 2, 2024|newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|publisher=The Philippine Daily Inquirer, Inc.|date=May 3, 2001|page=A16|quote=Of the 73 arrested rioters, 48 were from Barangay Holy Spirit in Quezon City, nine from [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]]...}}</ref>

====No-contact apprehension policy====
{{See also|No Contact Apprehension Policy}}
On July 1, 2022, the Quezon City government began fully implementing its [[No Contact Apprehension Policy]] on several major roads in the city. As a result, [[closed-circuit television]] cameras were installed on some intersections along [[Quirino Highway]], E. Rodriguez Sr. Avenue, [[Aurora Boulevard]], [[West Avenue (Quezon City)|West Avenue]], [[East Avenue (Quezon City)|East Avenue]], Kamias Road, and P. Tuazon Boulevard. Motorists that violate traffic policies would be sent a notice of violation by mail. This notice of violation is expected to be delivered within 14 days for city residents while non-residents are expected to receive their notices beyond the regular 14 days. Any traffic violations registered in the system can be checked from a dedicated website and its fines can be paid online.<ref name="QC_NCAP_begins">{{Cite news |last=De Guzman |first=Marcus |date=June 30, 2022 |title=QC's No-Contact Apprehension will apply on these roads |work=Autoindustriya |url=https://www.autoindustriya.com/auto-industry-news/qc-s-no-contact-apprehension-will-apply-on-these-roads.html |access-date=August 1, 2022 |archive-date=August 1, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220801105349/https://www.autoindustriya.com/auto-industry-news/qc-s-no-contact-apprehension-will-apply-on-these-roads.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

However, the policy has been criticized by motorists due to several intersections that have unclear directives on the proper way to navigate them correctly.

[[File:SMNotrthjf1943 06.JPG|thumb|center|700px|2013 panorama of North EDSA, featuring [[SM North EDSA]].]]Quezon City is politically subdivided into [[Legislative districts of Quezon City|six legislative districts]]. However, the city is also divided into non-legislative or informal districts based on its historical origins.

It also built upon Croft’s plan for the major thoroughfares in Manila and nearby towns. At the heart of the city was the 400-hectare Diliman quadrangle formed by four avenues—North, West, South and East—and designed to be the future location of national government buildings.

*'''Bago Bantay''': Located at the west central part of the city, this place is known as a residential area at the back of [[SM North EDSA]]. It is composed of barangays Alicia, Ramon Magsaysay, [[Santo Cristo, Quezon City|Santo Cristo]], and the northern part of [[Bagong Pag-asa]].

*'''Cubao''': Located at the southern part of the city, Cubao is the home of the 35-hectare [[Araneta City]], a mixed-use township development that contains prominent shopping malls such as [[Ali Mall]], [[Farmers Plaza]] and [[Gateway Mall (Araneta Center)|Gateway Mall]] and iconic landmarks such as the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]]. The [[Cubao Cathedral]] is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cubao]].
*'''Diliman''': Diliman is located at the center of Quezon City, the place where the city was originally established. The area is named for the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word for the medicinal fern species ''[[Stenochlaena palustris]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntfp.org/index.php?go=product&iid=279|title=Non-Timber Forest Products Exchange Programme|access-date=September 14, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upd.edu.ph/~updinfo/UPDate%20Magazine/magazine/UPDate%20magazine%20no2.html|title=Update Magazine Sept-Dec 2014|access-date=September 14, 2015|archive-date=July 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723081811/http://www.upd.edu.ph/~updinfo/UPDate%20Magazine/magazine/UPDate%20magazine%20no2.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Numerous national government offices are located in Diliman, as well as prominent colleges and universities such as the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]], [[Far Eastern University – Nicanor Reyes Educational Foundation|FEU–FERN College]], and [[New Era University]]. The Diliman Quadrangle, which is bounded by the [[North Avenue, Quezon City|North]], [[West Avenue, Quezon City|West]], [[Timog Avenue|South]] (Timog) and [[East Avenue, Quezon City|East]] Avenues, is known for its hospitals, government edifices, and nightlife bars.{{citation needed|date=January 2024}} Several streets in [[South Triangle]] and Barangay Laging Handa were named in honor of the 22 [[Boy Scouts of the Philippines|Boy Scouts]] who died in [[United Arab Airlines Flight 869 (1963)|a plane crash]] ''en route'' to joining the [[11th World Scout Jamboree]]. A memorial stands in the center of the roundabout at the intersection of Timog Avenue and Tomas Morato Avenue. The place was thus known as the ''Scout Area''. Major commercial broadcasting media and television networks such as [[ABS-CBN]] and [[GMA Network (company)|GMA]] have their headquarters within the Diliman Quadrangle. [[People's Television Network|PTV]], [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]], [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC]], and [[Philippine Broadcasting Service|PBS]] also hold headquarters in Diliman.
*'''Galas''': The Galas-Santol District of Quezon City is located in its southwest border with the City of Manila. The barangays of Dona Imelda, Dona Josefa, Dona Aurora and Don Manuel, named after public figures who significantly contributed to the city's early development, are located in this area. Barangays of Santo Nino, Santol and San Isidro serve as the border of [[Sampaloc, Manila|Sampaloc]] and [[Santa Mesa]] in [[Manila]]. SM City Sta. Mesa lies at the end of the Araneta avenue set as the crossing border within the three cities of [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]], Quezon City and Manila.
*'''La Loma''': La Loma is located the southwestern portion of the city. It has five barangays along the vicinity of its main streets: N.S. Amoranto Avenue (Retiro) and A. Bonifacio Avenue. The district is famed as the birthplace of many popular Filipino culinary figures and establishments especially devoted to the [[lechon]]. The nearby [[La Loma Cemetery]] is named after this place.
*'''[[Mariana, Quezon City|New Manila]]''': New Manila is named after the City of Manila, since most of its residents are affluent families from the city who wished to escape the stress of living in the capital.

[[File:Philippine Heart Center (East Avenue, Quezon City; 03-13-2021).jpg|thumb|The [[Philippine Heart Center]], one of the country's designer hospitals, was designed in the [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] style.]]
The architecture in Quezon City features a wide variety of architectural styles, such as [[Art Deco]], [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]], [[International Style (architecture)|International Modern]], [[Postmodern architecture|Postmodern]] and [[Contemporary architecture|Contemporary styles]].{{citation needed|date=August 2021}} The city also has numerous monuments and museums. When the city was created in 1939, [[Art Deco]] was the prevailing architectural style, moving forward from the colonial designs of [[Bahay na bato]] by the Spanish, and the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical style]] by the Americans. The choice of designing buildings in contemporary international style was intentional to show that the Philippines was moving forward since it was anticipating independence in 1945.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lico |first=Gerard |title=Arkitekturang Filipino: a history of architecture and urbanism in the Philippines |date=2008 |publisher=[[University of the Philippines Press]] |isbn=978-971-542-579-7 |location=Diliman, Quezon City}}</ref>

The [[Quezon Memorial Shrine]], which was built from 1952 to 1978, was designed in [[Art Deco]] style. It became the city's symbol and at its base was a museum and mausoleum dedicated to the late [[Manuel L. Quezon]] and his wife [[Aurora Quezon|Aurora]]. When the city became the capital in 1948, a lot of government buildings transferred from Manila to Quezon City. Numerous government buildings were built during the terms of President [[Elpidio Quirino]], [[Ramon Magsaysay]], [[Carlos P. Garcia]], [[Diosdado Macapagal]] and [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. However, it was only during the term of Marcos that began the ''Filipinization'' of architecture. Numerous government hospitals in the city such as the [[Lung Center of the Philippines]], [[Philippine Heart Center]], and the [[National Kidney and Transplant Institute|Kidney Center of the Philippines]] were built and regarded as "designer" hospitals.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lico |first=Gerard |title=Arkitekturang Filipino: a history of architecture and urbanism in the Philippines |date=2008 |publisher=[[University of the Philippines Press]] |isbn=978-971-542-579-7 |location=Diliman, Quezon City |pages=464}}</ref> Traditional Filipino design motifs were incorporated in government buildings such as the [[Batasang Pambansa Complex|Batasang Pambansa]], which drew inspiration from the ''[[Nipa hut|Bahay Kubo]]'' and the ''Bahay na bato''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lico |first=Gerard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l1X6nQEACAAJ |title=Arkitekturang Filipino: a history of architecture and urbanism in the Philippines |publisher=[[University of the Philippines Press]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-971-542-579-7 |location=Diliman, Quezon City |pages=474 |access-date=July 28, 2024 |archive-date=August 26, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240826165722/https://books.google.com/books?id=l1X6nQEACAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref> Most of the government buildings and structures built during the time of Marcos were associated with the "[[edifice complex]]" of the Marcoses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://newslab.philstar.com/31-years-of-amnesia/building-spree|title=Edifice complex {{!}} 31 years of amnesia|last=Afinidad-Bernardo|first=Deni Rose M.|work=The Philippine Star|access-date=May 3, 2018|archive-date=March 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304080521/http://newslab.philstar.com/31-years-of-amnesia/building-spree|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Master Plans===
{{main| Frost Plan}}

In 1938, [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Manuel L. Quezon]] made a decision to push for a new capital city. Manila was getting crowded, and his [[military advisor]]s reportedly told him that Manila, being by the bay, was an easy target for bombing by [[Naval artillery|naval guns]] in case of attack.<ref name="QC001" /><ref name="QC002" /> The new city will be located at least {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} away from [[Manila Bay]], which is beyond the reach of naval guns. Quezon contacted [[William E. Parsons]], an American architect and planner, who had been the consulting architect for the islands early in the American colonial period. Parsons came over in the summer of 1939 and helped select the Diliman (Tuason) estate as the site for the new city. Unfortunately, he died later that year, leaving his partner Harry Frost to take over. Frost collaborated with [[Juan Arellano]], engineer A.D. Williams, and landscape architect and planner Louis Croft to craft a grand master plan for the new capital. The plan was approved by the Philippine authorities in 1941.<ref name="QC001" /><ref name="QC002" />

The core of the new city was to be a {{convert|400|ha|adj=on}} Central Park, about the size of [[New York City|New York's]] [[Central Park]], and defined by the [[North Avenue, Quezon City|North]], [[Timog Avenue|South (Timog)]], [[East Avenue, Quezon City|East]] and [[West Avenue, Quezon City|West Avenues]]. On one corner of the proposed Diliman Quadrangle was delineated a {{convert|25|ha|adj=on}} elliptical site, the focal point of the grand quadrangle. This was the planned location of a large Capitol Building to house the [[Philippine Legislature]] and ancillary structures for the offices of representatives.<ref name="QC001" /><ref name="QC002" /> On either side of the giant ellipse were supposed to have been the new [[Malacañang Palace]] on North Avenue (site of the present-day [[Veterans Memorial Medical Center|Veterans Memorial Hospital]]), and the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] Complex along [[East Avenue, Quezon City|East Avenue]] (now the site of [[East Avenue Medical Center]]). The three branches of government were to be finally and efficiently located in close proximity to each other.<ref name="QC001" /><ref name="QC002" />
