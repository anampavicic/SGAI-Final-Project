'''Nuevo León''' ({{IPA|es|ˈnweβo leˈon|lang|NuevoLeon.ogg}}), officially the '''Free and Sovereign State of Nuevo León''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Estado Libre y Soberano de Nuevo León'') is a [[Administrative divisions of Mexico|state]] in northeastern [[Mexico]]. The state borders the Mexican states of [[Tamaulipas]], [[Coahuila]], [[Zacatecas]], and [[San Luis Potosí|San Luis Potosi]], and has an extremely narrow [[international border]] with the U.S. state of [[Texas]]. Covering 64,156 square kilometers (24,771 square miles) and with a population of 5.78 million people, Nuevo León is the thirteenth-largest [[Political divisions of mexico|federal entity]] by [[List of Mexican states by area|area]] and the seventh-most [[List of Mexican states by population|populous]] as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |title=DATA NUEVO LEÓN {{!}} N.L.

[[Monterrey]], the state's capital, is the most populous city in Nuevo León and the [[List of cities in Mexico|ninth-largest]] in Mexico. Monterrey is part of the [[Monterrey metropolitan area]], the [[Metropolitan areas of Mexico#List of metropolitan areas in Mexico by population|second-largest]] metropolitan area in the country with an estimated population of 5.3 million people in 2020.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web |last=Flores |first=Lourdes |title=Zona Metropolitana de Monterrey es la segunda más poblada de México: Inegi |url=https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/estados/Zona-Metropolitana-de-Monterrey-es-la-segunda-mas-poblada-de-Mexico-Inegi-20210224-0112.html |access-date=2021-05-27 |website=El Economista}}</ref> About 92% of the state's population lives in the metropolitan area.

Prior to European colonization, Nuevo León was home to various nomadic groups, known as [[Chichimeca|chichimecas]] to the Spaniards. Stemming from [[Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva|Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva's]] expedition in 1580, the [[New Kingdom of León]] was established, encompassing present-day Coahuila, Nuevo León, Tamaulipas, and Texas, but permanent settlement did not occur until 1592. In 1824, Nuevo León became a state of Mexico following the country's successful [[Mexican War of Independence|war for independence]]. The state began industrializing in the late 19th century and early 20th century, establishing various large companies, which accelerated after the [[Mexican Revolution]]. Today, Nuevo León is a major manufacturing hub with one of Mexico's largest economies.

== Etymology ==
The origins of Nuevo León's name can be traced back to the late-16th century, when Spanish explorer [[Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva]] named the region the [[New Kingdom of León]], in honor of the [[Kingdom of León]], as Carvajal noted various similarities between both territories, particularly their mountainous terrains.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-02-08 |title=¿Por qué Nuevo León se llama así?

==History==
{{Main|History of Nuevo León}}

=== Prehispanic history ===
Prior to European colonization, there was no established nation-state. Historians estimate that there were about 250 distinct indigenous [[nomad]] groups living in the state's territory, collectively known to the Spaniards as [[Chichimeca|chicimecas]].<ref name="elocal-hist">{{cite web |title=Historia – Nuevo León |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/nuevoleon/hist.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816015515/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/nuevoleon/hist.htm |archive-date=16 August 2011 |access-date=July 2, 2009 |publisher=e-local.gob.mx}}</ref> Archaeological remains, such as cave paintings and carved stones, enabled historians to identify four main indigenous groups that inhabited the state: the [[Coahuiltecan]]s to the west, Alazapas to the north, the "[[Quinigua language|Borrados]]" to the east, and the [[Guachichil]]es to the south.<ref name=":7">{{Cite web |title=Indigenous Nuevo León: Land of the Coahuiltecans |url=https://www.indigenousmexico.org/articles/indigenous-nuevo-leon-land-of-the-coahuiltecans |access-date=2024-02-17 |website=Indigenous Mexico |language=en-US}}</ref>

Like numerous groups across [[Aridoamerica]], the indigenous peoples of Nuevo León were constantly on the move in search for food. Predominantly reliant on hunting and gathering, many peoples traveled in small bands, establishing temporary settlements known as [[ranchería]]s, which typically housed one or two families. These settlements consisted of semispherical huts constructed from interwoven branches and thatched roofs.<ref name=":8">{{Cite book |last=Hoyo |first=Eugenio del |title=Historia del Nuevo Reino de León (1577-1723) |year=2014 |publisher=Fondo Editorial Nuevo León |isbn=978-607-8266-39-5 |edition=2nd |language=es-mx}}</ref> Those situated near rivers, such as the Salinas river, or in regions with more temperate climates, like areas near or within the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] mountain range, had access to fishing and limited agriculture.<ref name=":7" />

Due to their nomadic lifestyle, the communities never laid claim to land permanently, and they did not develop political hierarchies similar to the ones found in [[Mesoamerica]]n societies.<ref name=":6">{{Cite thesis |title=Revolution and the Industrial City: Violence and Capitalism in Monterrey, Mexico, 1890-1920 |url=https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/709777 |publisher=Georgetown University |date=2014 |degree=thesis |language=en |first=Rodolfo |last=Fernandez}}</ref> Consequently, governance within these tribes was absent, reflecting a decentralized social structure.<ref name=":8" />

=== Colonial period ===
{{Further|New Kingdom of León|History of the Catholic Church in Mexico}}

In 1535, [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca|Alvaro Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]] led one of the first expeditions into Nuevo León territory. Colonization attempts began in 1577 under [[Alberto del Canto]], who founded ''Santa Lucía'' in present-day Monterrey. However, these efforts failed due to indigenous raids, who were labeled as [[Indios Bárbaros]] by the colonizers.<ref name="elocal-hist" /> In 1579, [[Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva]], a member of del Canto's expedition, returned to Spain and negotiated with [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II]] to establish a new territory in northern [[New Spain]]. He returned to the territory in 1580 and founded the [[New Kingdom of León]] in 1582, with its capital, ''San Luis Rey de Francia'', established where ''Santa Lucía'' once stood, marking Monterrey's second founding. However, colonization efforts failed once again in 1588, when Carvajal was reported to the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]], accused of being a descendant of [[New Christian]]s.<ref name=":8" /> Since then, the region remained mostly uninhabited by the Spaniards.

In 1596, [[Diego de Montemayor]], accompanied by twelve families, sought to repopulate the New Kingdom of León. On 20 September, he established the ''[[Monterrey|Ciudad Metropolitana de Nuestra Señora de Monterrey]]'', marking Monterrey's third and definitive founding. During this period, despite the majority of the population being concentrated in Monterrey, the town remained small and isolated from other important towns like [[Saltillo]] and [[Zacatecas (city)|Zacatecas]]. Life for the early inhabitants was marked by poverty, with agriculture and livestock farming being the primary occupations, focused solely on self-consumption. The establishment of Spanish settlements in the northern part of the territory were hindered by [[Coahuiltecan people|Coahuiltecan]] attacks, mostly in response to Spanish [[Slave raiding|slave raids]] on the natives.<ref name="elocal-hist" />

[[Evangelism|Evangelization]] served as a key instrument of Spanish colonization and cultural assimilation, with numerous friars arriving in the New Kingdom of León during the 17th and 18th centuries to convert the natives. In 1602, the first [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] convent in Monterrey was established, named the convent of San Andrés.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Espinoza |first=Lidia |date=1997 |title=EL CONVENTO FRANCISCANO DE SAN ANDRÉS EN LA CIUDAD DE MONTERREY |url=https://humanitas.uanl.mx/index.php/ah/article/view/1321 |journal=Humanitas Digital |language=es |issue=24 |pages=449–482 |issn=2007-1620}}</ref> Throughout the colonial period, a total of twenty missions were established, of which ten are present-day municipalities of Nuevo León, including [[Salinas Victoria]] (Mission ''Guadalupe de las Salinas''), [[Agualeguas]] (Mission ''Nuestra Señora de Agualeguas''), and [[Guadalupe, Nuevo León|Guadalupe]] (Mission ''Valle de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe''), among others.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ordoñez |first=Plino D. |date=1953 |title=Las misiones franciscanas del Nuevo Reino de Leon (1575-1715) |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25134312 |journal=Historia Mexicana |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=102–111 |jstor=25134312 |issn=0185-0172}}</ref> Some missions failed due to the natives' resistance or deadly diseases spread by the Spaniards, while others thrived with [[Tlaxcaltec|Tlaxcalan]] reinforcement.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hernández Torres |first=Arnoldo |date=2009 |title=Las misiones y presidios del Nuevo Reino de León y de la Colonia del Nuevo Santander |url=http://www.equilibrioeconomico.uadec.mx/descargas/Rev2009/Rev09Sem1Art3.pdf |journal=Equilibrio Económico |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=69–98}}</ref>
[[File:Provincias Internas de Oriente.jpg|thumb|The ''Provincias Internas'' in 1815, showing the territory of Coahuila, the New Kingdom of León, Nuevo Santander, and Texas.]]
The New Kingdom of León asserted claims over regions in present-day [[Coahuila]], Nuevo León, [[Tamaulipas]], and [[Texas]]. However, throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the province experienced territorial losses. In 1643, a successful lawsuit brought to the [[Royal Audiencia of Guadalajara]] by the governor of [[Nueva Vizcaya, New Spain|Nueva Vizcaya]] removed the New Kingdom of León's jurisdiction over Coahuila and Texas, with the case citing Carvajal's illegal attempts to invade territories belonging to Nueva Vizcaya in the 1580s.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gerhard |first=Peter |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=imxCNQAACAAJ |title=Geografía histórica de la Nueva España, 1519-1821 |date=1986 |publisher=Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México |isbn=978-968-36-0294-7 |language=es}}</ref> The second loss was caused by pressure from the [[Louisiana (New France)|French incursions in Louisiana]] and requests from the New Kingdom of León to colonize the northeastern Mexican coast in order to pacify and convert its natives,<ref>{{Cite web |title=José de Escandón y las Nuevas Poblaciones del Nuevo Santander |url=https://www.ub.edu/geocrit/sn/sn-218-85.htm |access-date=2024-02-18 |website=www.ub.edu}}</ref> prompting the Viceroy of New Spain to reorganize the New Kingdom of León, which established [[Nuevo Santander]], resulting in the loss of present-day Tamaulipas.

During the establishment of the [[Provincias Internas]], the New Kingdom of León became part of the Eastern Internal Provinces, alongside the provinces of Coahuila, Nuevo Santander, and Texas.<ref>Gerhard, Peter. The North Frontier of New Spain. Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1982.</ref>

=== Mexican War of Independence ===
{{Further|Mexican War of Independence|1824 Constitution of Mexico}}
On 16 September 1810, the [[Cry of Dolores]] occurred, signaling the start of Mexican War of Independence. However, it took until 29 September for news of this event to reach the New Kingdom of León due to its geographical isolation from the rest of New Spain. In January 1811, the governor of the New Kingdom of León, Manuel de Santa María, joined the insurgency after the [[Royalist (Spanish American independence)|royalist]] defeat at the Battle of Aguanueva and [[José Mariano Jiménez|José Mariano Jiménez's]] arrival in Monterrey, who arrived to spread the insurgency in the Provincias Internas. Despite these efforts, various counter-insurgency movements emerged in the territories, leading to the capture of key figures at the [[Wells of Baján]] in Coahuila.<ref name=":13">En los albores de la independencia: Las Provincias Internas de Oriente durante la insurrección de don Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, 1810–1811. by Isidro Vizcaya Canales</ref>

Afterwards, the movement encountered resistance among the population of the territory, as many were royalists. Some attribute this to the region's stronger ties to Spain and its high proportion of people of white or [[Criollo people|criollo]] ancestry, constituting 63% of the population according to the Revillagigedo census of 1790.<ref name=":13" /> The council of Monterrey, which was the capital and biggest city of the New Kingdom of León, remained loyal to Spain until [[José Joaquín de Arredondo|Joaquín de Arredondo]], the commandant of the Eastern Internal Provinces,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Association |first=Texas State Historical |title=Arredondo, Joaquín de |url=https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/arredondo-joaquin-de |access-date=2024-04-02 |website=Texas State Historical Association |language=en}}</ref> endorsed the [[Plan of Iguala]] on 3 July 1821.<ref>{{Cite web |title=La lucha por la Independencia en Monterrey - Periódico El Regio |url=https://elregio.com/Noticia/71ab207d-f671-43a2-a077-76a8f13b2ec2 |access-date=2024-04-01 |website=elregio.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Moreno Gutiérrez |first=Rodrigo |title=La consumación de la independencia en el norte: síntesis y reflexión |publisher=Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México |year=2010 |pages=400–404}}</ref>[[File:Frayservando.jpg|thumb|207x207px|Portrait of Servando Teresa de Mier]]After Mexican independence, [[Servando Teresa de Mier|Fray Servando Teresa de Mier]] represented the New Kingdom of León in the national constituent congress. In the 1824 Constitution of Mexico, the name of the entity was shortened to Nuevo León, its present-day name, and it was made a state of the [[First Mexican Republic]]. Mier organized the establishment of the [[Congress of Nuevo León|local legislature]], which drafted and enacted the state's first constitution on 5 March 1825.

=== Independence to late 19th century ===
{{Further|Republic of the Rio Grande|Mexican–American War|Battle of Monterrey|Plan of Ayutla|Second French intervention in Mexico}}

Once the federal system was established, internal divisions between federalist and centralist factions emerged, eventually leading to the enactment of [[Siete Leyes|''Las Siete Leyes'']] in 1835, which dissolved the federal structure, replacing the state of Nuevo León with a department. In response to these centralist policies, a secessionist movement arose, resulting in the establishment of the [[Republic of the Rio Grande]] in 1840.

On 21 September 1846, during the Mexican-American War, the Battle of Monterrey was fought, a three-day assault on Nuevo León's capital by U.S. forces. The Mexican forces, commanded by [[Pedro de Ampudia]], faced off against the U.S. troops led by [[Zachary Taylor]], whose objective was to take the city in order to advance toward [[Mexico City]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gateway South: The Campaign for Monterrey |url=https://history.army.mil/brochures/the%20campaign%20for%20monterrey/the%20campaign%20for%20monterrey.htm#:~:text=His%20troops%20would%20occupy%20as,advance%20southward%20toward%20Mexico%20City. |access-date=2024-02-18 |website=history.army.mil}}</ref> The battle inflicted heavy casualties on both sides.

=== Industrialization and Mexican Revolution ===
{{Further|Industrial history of Monterrey|Porfiriato|Mexican Revolution||}}

During the Porfiriato, [[Bernardo Reyes]] was sent to Nuevo León by [[Porfirio Díaz]], where Reyes was governor from 1885 to 1887 and from 1889 to 1909. Reyes suppressed small insurrections and banditry in multiple municipalities while also starting infrastructure projects, such as the State Penitentiary, the construction of the [[Palacio de Gobierno (Nuevo León)|Government Palace]], and the renovation of numerous plazas and markets.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Garza |first=Israel Cavazos |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lV8WAAAAYAAJ |title=Breve historia de Nuevo León |date=1995 |publisher=Colegio de México |isbn=978-968-16-4541-0 |language=es}}</ref> Additionally, in 1892, Reyes negotiated a land swap with Coahuila so that Nuevo León had access to the international border with Texas.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ramírez |first=Manuel Ceballos |date=1991 |title=El control geopolítico en el noreste porfiriano: Nuevo Laredo y la fundación de Colombia en 1892 |url=https://fronteranorte.colef.mx/index.php/fronteranorte/article/view/1614 |journal=Frontera Norte |language=es |volume=3 |issue=5 |doi=10.17428/rfn.v3i5.1614 |doi-broken-date=1 November 2024 |issn=2594-0260}}</ref>

Reyes' policies rapidly industrialized the state, overseeing the establishment of significant companies, including Cuauhtémoc brewery, later known as [[Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma Brewery]], in 1900; [[Monterrey Foundry]], now [[Fundidora Park]], in 1904; Cementos Hidalgo, later known as [[Cemex]], in 1905; and Vidrios y Cristales de Monterrey, later known as [[Vitro]], in 1909.<ref name=":12">{{Cite book |last=Canales |first=Isidro Vizcaya |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zK_qvmuHeZgC |title=Los orígenes de la industrialización de Monterrey: una historia económica y social desde la caída del Segundo Imperio hasta el fin de la Revolución (1867-1920). |date=2006 |publisher=Fondo Editorial de NL |isbn=978-970-9715-17-0 |language=es}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Saragoza |first=Alex M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cWvUBAAAQBAJ&dq=fundidora+de+monterrey+milmo+sada+madero&pg=PT104 |title=The Monterrey Elite and the Mexican State, 1880–1940 |date=2014-10-14 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-1-4773-0486-0 |language=en}}</ref>

In 1909, the [[1909 Monterrey hurricane|deadliest hurricane]] in the state's history struck, resulting in around 3,000 deaths in Monterrey and at least $50 million (1909 USD; ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|50000000|1909|r=2}}}} {{#time:Y}} USD) in damages.

During the [[Mexican Revolution]], Monterrey witnessed multiple attempts to seize control by different factions. In October 1913, Carrancista forces initially succeeded in seizing key locations such as the [[Palacio del Obispado|Obispado]] and a barracks, but faced strong [[Federal Army|Federal]] resistance while advancing towards the city center, retreating the next day. In April 1914, after a prolonged conflict, Carrancistas captured the city center, installing [[Antonio Irineo Villarreal|Antonio Villarreal]], a radical liberal, as governor, who implemented controversial measures like expelling foreign priests, demolishing temples, and destroying religious images. [[Villistas|Villista]] forces briefly captured Monterrey in early 1915, with [[Pancho Villa]] visiting Monterrey for fundraising efforts.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Daniel |first1=Pérez |last2=Herón |first2=G. |date=2011 |title=La Revolución Mexicana en Nuevo León (1908-1917): la irrupción pública de los empresarios en la política local |journal=Nóesis: Revista de Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades|s2cid=142848310 }}</ref> By May 1915, Carrancistas regained control and installed Idelfonso Vázquez as interim governor.

=== 1930s–present ===
For the rest of the 20th century, Nuevo León's economy underwent continued industrialization. Major families, holding majority shares in the state's largest companies, such as the Cuauhtémoc brewery, Monterrey Foundry, and Cementos Hidalgo, strategically reinvested their profits into diverse sectors, aiding in the expansion of both the industrial and banking sectors. By the 1980s, 91% of the employed population was in the secondary and tertiary sectors.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=el04zgEACAAJ |title=Monterrey: siete estudios contemporáneos |date=1988 |publisher=Fac. |language=es}}</ref>
[[File:Condominio Acero - panoramio.jpg|thumb|''Condominios Acero'', the first high-rise in Nuevo León, was built due to increased demand for office space.|left]]
The industrial surge led to remarkable population growth, soaring from 417,491 in 1930 to 3,098,736 in 1990. Monterrey's urban sprawl surpassed city limits by the 1970s, extending into adjacent municipalities like Guadalupe, San Pedro Garza García, Santa Catarina, San Nicolás, General Escobedo, and Apodaca. The 1960s witnessed the construction of the state's first high-rise, ''Condominios Acero''. The state's first shopping mall, [[Galerías Monterrey]], was founded in 1983, resulting in the development of numerous shopping complexes throughout the region, such as [[Plaza Fiesta San Agustín]] in 1988. To meet the population's urban transport needs, the government inaugurated [[Metrorrey]], Monterrey's light rapid transit system, in 1991.

In 1994, the signing of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] cemented Nuevo León's position as a manufacturing hub with an export-oriented economy, capitalizing on its close proximity to the United States to export goods.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Beltrones |first1=Manlio Fabio |last2=Reta Martínez |first2=Carlos |last3=Gurría |first3=Ángel |last4=Carstens Carstens |first4=Agustín |last5=Portal Matínez |first5=Juan Manuel |last6=Romero Gudiño |first6=Alejandro |last7=López Ayllón |first7=Sergio |last8=Cejudo |first8=Guillermo M. |last9=Contreras López |first9=Pedro Ángel |date=2018-07-24 |title=Los avances del México contemporáneo: 1955-2015.

By the end of the 20th century, the absolute political dominance of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]], which had started in 1929, began to wane, resulting in the election of [[Fernando Canales Clariond]] of the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] as governor in 1997. [[File:Monterrey Rascacielos.jpg|thumb|Monterrey skyline marked by various skyscrapers in the 2010s.]]
The early 21st century saw continued growth, with a population of 5,784,442 by 2020. The process of verticalization in [[Monterrey metropolitan area|Greater Monterrey]] intensified, marked by the construction of increasingly numerous and taller skyscrapers, notably [[Torre Avalanz]], [[Torre KOI]], and [[Torres Obispado]], among others. By the late 2010s and 2020s, the state was experiencing a [[nearshoring]] boom,<ref>{{Cite web |title=The city where Mexico's nearshoring hype is becoming reality |url=https://www.ft.com/content/445a2ca2-931b-4556-b735-a9d70f5e7b44 |access-date=2024-02-19 |website=Financial Times}}</ref> characterized by significant foreign investment from automotive companies like [[Kia]] and [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Averbuch |first=Maya |date=3 March 2023 |title=Tesla Mexico Plant Means $10 Billion Investment, Garcia Says |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-03/tesla-s-mexico-plant-means-10-billion-investment-governor-says |access-date=25 September 2023 |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |language=en}}</ref> However, due to the rapid industrialization and urbanization, the state faced environmental concerns, such as poor air quality and water shortages, the latter caused by droughts.

The [[Mexican drug war]] led to a significant decline in security within the state, marked by several massacres during the war's initial phases, notable examples being the [[2011 Monterrey casino attack]] and the [[Cadereyta Jiménez massacre]].

==Geography==
[[File:Relieve de Nuevo León.jpg|left|thumb|From top to bottom, the map displays the state's three physiographic provinces: the [[Great Plains]], the [[Gulf Coastal Plains]], and the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] mountain range.]]
Covering an area of 64,156 square kilometers (24,771 square miles), Nuevo León ranks as the [[Political divisions of mexico|13th largest federal entity by size]] in Mexico. The state is located in the northeastern part of Mexico and is bordered by [[Tamaulipas]] to the east, [[Coahuila]] to the west, both [[Zacatecas]] and [[San Luis Potosí|San Luis Potosi]] to the south, and the U.S. state of [[Texas]] to the north. The state boasts a diverse geography, encompassing three key [[physiographic province]]s in the northeast region.<ref name=":10">{{Cite web |title=Relieve. Nuevo León |url=https://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/nl/territorio/relieve.aspx?tema=me&e=19 |access-date=2024-02-20 |website=cuentame.inegi.org.mx}}</ref>
[[File:Cerro de la Silla (cropped).jpg|thumb|The [[Cerro de la Silla]], a well-known symbol of the state, is part of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range.]]
The state's southern and western scenery is dominated by the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] mountain range, covering 50.9% of the state's territory. Notable features formed by the mountain range include the Galeana and Doctor Arroyo plateaus, the Iguana, Picachos, Papagayos, and Santa Clara mountain ranges, and the Pilón, Ascensión, and Río Blanco valleys.<ref name=":10" /> [[Cerro Potosí]], which is the state's highest elevation at 3,710 meters above sea level, is part of the mountain range.

The [[Great Plains]] is considered to start in the northernmost regions of Nuevo León, constituting 34.6% of the state's land. This area is characterized by gentle hills along the [[Rio Grande]]. In the east, the Northern [[Gulf Coastal Plain|Gulf Coastal Plains]] cover 14.5% of the state, featuring low-altitude lands classified as an "inclined plain" due to the alluvial terrain.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |last=INEGI |date=1986 |title=Síntesis Geográfica del Estado de Nuevo León |url=http://internet.contenidos.inegi.org.mx/contenidos/productos/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/historicos/2104/702825220747/702825220747_1.pdf |website=Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografía e Informática}}</ref>

The [[San Juan River (Tamaulipas)|San Juan River]], one of the Rio Grande's major [[Tributary|tributaries]], is one of the most important rivers in the state, as it supplies the El Cuchillo reservoir, which in turn provides water for the [[Monterrey metropolitan area]]. It is fed by many of its own tributaries, such as the [[Pesquería River]] and the {{ill|Santa Catarina River (Mexico)|lt=Santa Catarina River|es|Río Santa Catarina}}, with the latter flowing through the metropolitan area.

The state also houses additional reservoirs to provide water to its residents. Among the significant ones are the Cerro Prieto, La Boca, Agualeguas, Sombreretillo, El Porvenir, and Loma Larga reservoirs.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Agua.

===Climate===
Nuevo León is located at the intersection of various [[Köppen climate classification|climate zones]], these being hot desert, hot semi-arid, cold semi-arid, and humid subtropical climates. The majority of the state, including most of the [[Monterrey metropolitan area]], has a [[hot semi-arid climate]], while the northern part of the state has a [[hot desert climate]] due to its proximity to the [[Chihuahuan Desert|Chihuahuan desert]]. Some southern portions of the state have a [[humid subtropical climate]] due to the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] mountain range.<ref name=":02">{{Cite web |title=Clima. Nuevo León |url=https://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/nl/territorio/clima.aspx?tema=me&e=19 |access-date=2024-01-19 |website=cuentame.inegi.org.mx}}</ref>

The state typically encounters arid, hot summers, with peak temperatures in the hottest regions soaring to 47&nbsp;°C. As summer progresses, the climate transitions into a wet season, primarily observed in August and September, marked by increased rainfall. During these periods of rainfall, the temperature drops significantly, leading to lower than average temperatures. The state experiences mild winters with average high temperatures around 21&nbsp;°C and lows around 8&nbsp;°C. Notably, regions next to or situated on the mountain ranges have lower mean temperatures compared to the rest of the state during the winter months, which may cause occasional light snowfall in the winter.<ref name=":02" />

While snowfall is a rare occurrence in the entire state, it has been documented during winter storms and cold fronts. One notable event happened on January 9, 1967, when 50&nbsp;cm of snow fell within an 8-hour period.<ref name="Winkler">{{cite journal |last=Winkler |first=William |year=1967 |title=The Weather and Circulation of January 1967 |url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/095/mwr-095-04-0227.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Monthly Weather Review |volume=95 |issue=4 |pages=227–233 |bibcode=1967MWRv...95..227W |doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1967)095<0227:ammwuh>2.3.co;2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522204642/http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/095/mwr-095-04-0227.pdf |archive-date=May 22, 2013 |access-date=January 29, 2013 |doi-access=free}}</ref> Additional instances of snowfall in the state include a February 1895 winter storm during the [[Great Freeze]], the [[2004 Christmas Eve United States winter storm|2004 Christmas Eve winter storm]], and the [[February 13–17, 2021 North American winter storm|February 2021 North American winter storm]].<ref name=":5">{{Cite web |title=Muestran Monterrey Nevado {{!}} Gobierno del Estado de Nuevo León |url=https://www.nl.gob.mx/boletines-comunicados-y-avisos/muestran-monterrey-nevado |access-date=2024-01-19 |website=www.nl.gob.mx}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-02-10 |title=Nuevo León ha presentado temperaturas más frías en febrero |url=https://www.mmradio.com/local/nuevo-leon-ha-presentado-temperaturas-mas-frias-en-febrero |access-date=2024-01-19 |website=Multimedios Radio |language=es}}</ref>

==== Tropical cyclones ====
While rare, hurricanes and tropical storms can impact Nuevo León, bringing high levels of rainfall to the state. The increased precipitation often results in the overflow of the state's rivers, most notably the Santa Catarina River, leading to fatalities and significant damage to urban infrastructure. Notable examples of this include the [[1909 Monterrey hurricane]], causing about 3,000 fatalities in Monterrey; [[Hurricane Gilbert]] in 1988 with approximately 150 fatalities; and [[Hurricane Alex (2010)|Hurricane Alex]] in 2010, which caused 15 deaths. Additional storms that have impacted the state have been [[Tropical Storm Fernand (2019)|Tropical Storm Fernand]] in 2019 and [[Hurricane Hanna (2020)|Hurricane Hanna]] in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-09-06 |title='Más de 20 años'; la coincidencia en las fechas que llegaron huracanes a NL |url=https://abcnoticias.mx/tendencia/2022/9/6/mas-de-20-anos-la-coincidencia-en-las-fechas-que-llegaron-huracanes-nl-170388.html |access-date=2024-01-19 |website=ABC Noticias |language=es}}</ref>{{climate chart

==Sports==
In Nuevo León there is a wide diversity of sports that are practiced with great relevance.

The most practiced sport in the State has been [[baseball]]. It is home to the [[Sultanes de Monterrey]], a professional baseball team with the longest history in the [[Mexican League]], who have won ten championships since their founding in 1939. The [[Estadio Mobil Super]] is the largest baseball stadium in Mexico. In addition, its children's teams have been world champions in 1957, 1958 and 1997 in the Little League World Series.

Since the 1980s, [[association football]] has begun to gain popularity in the State after gaining followers among society. The oldest team is the [[C.F. Monterrey]] (popularly known as the ''Rayados''), who have won the [[Liga MX]] on 5 occasions, in addition to 5 [[CONCACAF Champions Cup|Concacaf Champions Leagues]] -three of them consecutively-, and 3 [[Copa MX|Cups]] for a total of 13 championships. For its part, [[Tigres UANL]], the first team from Nuevo León to win a tournament, has 16 titles, including 8 League titles, 3 Cup titles and 1 Concacaf Champions League. The [[Clásico Regiomontano]] is considered one of the most anticipated matches of the season, and this is due to the already deep-rooted rivalry between Tigres and Monterrey for the honor of being the best team in the State or the luxurious squads with which they count. Both clubs have had confrontations in decisive matches, such as the two finals they faced, in [[2017–18 Liga MX season#Torneo Apertura|2017]] and [[2019 CONCACAF Champions League|2019]]. It is well known that fans each year wait in line for days outside both stadiums to get tickets, which are often priced at two or three times their original value.

Nuevo León also has a professional [[basketball]] team, with the [[Fuerza Regia de Monterrey]] squad as the greatest exponent that participates in the [[Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional]] (LNBP). They play at the [[Gimnasio Nuevo León]]. In 2004, it hosted the first [[WNBA]] game outside the [[United States]] between the [[Detroit Shock]] and the [[San Antonio Silver Stars]].

[[Ice hockey]] has shown notable growth in the state, although it is less popular than other more popular sports such as soccer or baseball. The state of Nuevo León has a professional team associated with the recent Mexican Hockey Federation, the [[Toros Monterrey]], whose headquarters are the Monterrey Ice Complex ice rink, in [[Santa Catarina, Nuevo León|Santa Catarina]].

Influenced by the proximity to the U.S., [[American football]] is another popular sport. The [[Autonomous University of Nuevo León]], with the [[Auténticos Tigres UANL|Auténticos Tigres]], and the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education]], with the [[Borregos Salvajes Monterrey|Borregos Salvajes]], are precursors of this sport in the country. The Auténticos play in the [[Organización Nacional Estudiantil de Fútbol Americano]] (ONEFA), and are based at the [[Estadio Gaspar Mass]]. While the Borregos play in the [[Comisión Nacional Deportiva Estudiantil de Instituciones Privadas]] (CONADEIP), and are based at the [[Estadio Borregos]].
