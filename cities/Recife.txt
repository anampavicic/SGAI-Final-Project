'''Recife''' ({{IPA|pt-BR|ʁeˈsifi|lang|Br-Recife.ogg}}) is the [[Federative units of Brazil|state]] capital of [[Pernambuco]], [[Brazil]], on the northeastern [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of [[South America]]. It is the second largest urban area within both the [[North Region, Brazil|North]] and the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Region]] of Brazil after Fortaleza. It is the largest city in Pernambuco state, and the sixth-largest [[urban area]] in all of Brazil; the [[Metropolitan area|metro]] population of the city of Recife was 3,726,974 in 2022.<ref name="concentrações_urbanas">{{cite web|url=http://saladeimprensa.ibge.gov.br/noticias?view=noticia&id=1&busca=1&idnoticia=2855|title=Mais da metade da população vive em 294 arranjos formados por contiguidade urbana e por deslocamentos para trabalho e estudo|language=pt|publisher=Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|access-date=March 16, 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20150328053411/http://saladeimprensa.ibge.gov.br/noticias?view=noticia&id=1&busca=1&idnoticia=2855|archive-date=March 28, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://geoftp.ibge.gov.br/organizacao_do_territorio/divisao_regional/arranjos_populacionais/arranjos_populacionais.pdf|title=Arranjos Populacionais e Concentrações Urbanas do Brasil|page=148|language=pt|publisher=Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|access-date=March 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.ibge.gov.br/Estimativas_de_Populacao/Estimativas_2016/estimativa_dou_2016.pdf|title=Estimativas da população residente no Brasil e Unidades da Federação com data de referência em 1º de julho de 2016|language=pt|publisher=Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|access-date=March 16, 2017|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6k9c8J3Zv?url=ftp://ftp.ibge.gov.br/Estimativas_de_Populacao/Estimativas_2016/estimativa_dou_2016.pdf|archive-date=August 30, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Recife was founded in 1537, serving as the main harbor of the [[Captaincy of Pernambuco]]—known for its [[Brazilian sugar cycle|large-scale production of sugar cane]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www3.folhape.com.br/diversao/diversao/literatura/2018/12/02/NWS,89165,71,585,DIVERSAO,2330-ENTREVISTA-COM-LAURENTINO-GOMES-MERGULHO-ORIGEM-EXCLUSAO-SOCIAL.aspx|title=Entrevista com Laurentino Gomes: um mergulho na origem da exclusão social|language=pt|publisher=Folha de Pernambuco|access-date=April 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228005706/http://www3.folhape.com.br/diversao/diversao/literatura/2018/12/02/NWS,89165,71,585,DIVERSAO,2330-ENTREVISTA-COM-LAURENTINO-GOMES-MERGULHO-ORIGEM-EXCLUSAO-SOCIAL.aspx|archive-date=February 28, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> At one point, it was known as [[Mauritsstad]], when it served as the capital city of the 17th century colony of [[New Holland (Brazil)|New Holland]] of [[Dutch Brazil]] (founded by the [[Dutch West India Company]]). Situated at the confluence of the [[Beberibe River|Beberibe]] and [[Capibaribe River|Capibaribe]] rivers, before they drain into the [[South Atlantic Ocean]], Recife is a major [[Port|seaport]] along the Brazilian Atlantic coast. Its name is an allusion to the stone [[reef]]s that are present offshore. Together with the urban presence of the Beberibe and Capibaribe rivers and their [[Tributary|tributaries]], the many additional unique, small islands—and more than 50 bridges linking them throughout the city—create a distinct maritime or "riviera" atmosphere, leading to Recife being known as the "[[Venice|Venice of Brazil]]".

{{As of|2010}}, Recife has maintained the highest [[Human Development Index|HDI]] of any state capital in Northeastern Brazil, and the second-highest of the entire Northern and Northeastern regions (second only to [[Palmas, Tocantins|Palmas]]).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.atlasbrasil.org.br/2013/pt/perfil_m/recife_pe |title=&#124; Atlas do Desenvolvimento Humano no Brasil |access-date=November 27, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205153414/http://www.atlasbrasil.org.br/2013/pt/perfil_m/recife_pe |archive-date=December 5, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, the city also is known as having some of the highest rates of [[gun violence]] in the entire country, despite also being considered the "safest state capital" in the Northeast. Although Recife often has a consistently higher crime rate than Brazil's [[South Region, Brazil|South Region]], it typically has a much lower crime rate than other regional capitals—such as [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] or [[São Luís, Maranhão|São Luís]]. Nonetheless, crime rose nearly 440% in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Recife é a capital mais segura do Nordeste &#124; Prefeitura do Recife |url=http://www2.recife.pe.gov.br/noticias/30/09/2015/recife-e-capital-mais-segura-do-nordeste |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315001526/http://www2.recife.pe.gov.br/noticias/30/09/2015/recife-e-capital-mais-segura-do-nordeste |archive-date=March 15, 2017 |access-date=March 14, 2017}}</ref> The waters along the coastline are also considered to be among the most dangerous "on earth", as there have been many recorded shark attacks on swimmers at the beaches, including fatal incidents.

The [[Recife metropolitan area|Metropolitan Region of Recife]] is the main industrial zone of the State of Pernambuco, major products are those derived from [[Sugarcane|cane]] (sugar and [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|ethanol]]), motor vehicles, ships, oil platforms, electronics, software, and others. With fiscal incentives by the government, many industrial companies were started in the 1970s and 1980s. Recife has a tradition of being the most important [[commerce|commercial hub]] of the North/Northeastern region of Brazil, with more than 52,500 business enterprises in Recife plus 32,500 in the Metro Area, totaling more than 85,000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.condepefidem.pe.gov.br/ |title=Recife Municipal Profile |access-date=October 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121223916/http://www.condepefidem.pe.gov.br/ |archive-date=November 21, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Recife stands out as a major tourist site within the Brazilian Northeast, known for the city itself, its beaches and for its historical sites, with many places of significance dating back to both the Portuguese and the Dutch colonies in the region. The beach of [[Porto de Galinhas]], located {{convert|60|km|mi|sp=us}} south of the city, has been repeatedly awarded the title of best beach in Brazil and has drawn many tourists. The Historic Centre of [[Olinda]], {{convert|7|km|mi|sp=us}} north of the city, was declared a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1982, and both cities' [[Brazilian Carnival]] are among the world's most famous. According to [[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]], Recife has the biggest consumption of whisky around the world.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2011-12-04 |title=Saude!

The city is an education hub, and home to the [[Federal University of Pernambuco]], the largest university in Pernambuco. Several Brazilian historical figures, such as the poet and abolitionist [[Castro Alves]], moved to Recife for their studies. Recife and [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]] are the only Brazilian cities with direct flights to the islands of [[Fernando de Noronha]], a World Heritage Site.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1000 |title=Unesco – Fernando de Noronha Islands |access-date=June 12, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607082330/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1000 |archive-date=June 7, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Recife was one of the host cities of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], and previously hosted the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]] and the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]].

'''Recife''' began as a collection of fishing shacks, inns and warehouses on the [[river delta|delta]] between the [[Capibaribe River|Capibaribe]] and [[Beberibe River]]s in the [[captaincy of Pernambuco]], sometime between 1535 and 1537 in the earliest days of [[Portuguese colonisation of the Americas#Colonisation of Brazil|Portuguese colonisation]] of ''[[Terra de Santa Cruz]]'', later called Brazil, on the [[Northeast Brazil|northeast coast]] of [[South America]]. It was a settlement of colonial fishermen and way station for [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] sailors and passing ships. 

The first documented reference to the settlement with its "''arrecife dos navios''" (reef of the ships) was in the royal Charter Act of March 12, 1537, establishing [[Olinda]], {{convert|6|km|abbr=off}} to the north, as a village, with its port where the Beberibe River meets the sea.  Olinda (and [[Igarassu, Pernambuco|Igarassu]] before it) had been settled in 1536 by [[Captain General]] [[Duarte Coelho]], a Portuguese nobleman, proprietor and administrator of the captaincy of Pernambuco.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marley|first=D.|title=Historic Cities of the Americas: North America and South America|volume=2|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1576070277|page=683}}</ref>

The city is named for the long reef ''recife'' running parallel to the shoreline which encloses its harbour.  The reef is not as sometimes stated, a coral reef, but a consolidated ancient beach, now as firm and hard as stone.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Banner|first=J.C.|title=The Stone Reefs of Brazil, their Geological and Geographical Relations|journal=Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology|year=1904|volume=XLIV|location=Harvard College, Cambridge}}</ref>

In 1541, Coelho returned from the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] with the machinery for an ''[[engenho]]'' (sugar mill), and with it, his brother-in-law established the first mill named ''Nossa Senhora da Ajuda'' (Our Lady of Help), in the floodplain of the Beberibe River at Recife.  At that time the banks of the Capibaribe River were covered by [[sugar cane]].

Recife was capital of the 17th century [[New Holland (Brazil)|New Holland]] (Dutch Brazil) established by the [[Dutch West India Company]] and was called [[Mauritsstad]]. The city was eventually [[Recapture of Recife (1652-54)|recaptured by the Portuguese]] in 1654, following their victories at the [[First Battle of Guararapes|first]] and [[second Battle of Guararapes]].

The [[Mascate War]] of 1710–1711 pitted merchants of Recife against those of nearby [[Olinda]].

==Geography==
[[File:Recife, Brasil.jpg|thumb|Recife has one of the greatest rainfall averages in Brazil.]]

Due to the city's proximity to the [[equator]], Recife's weather is generally warm. It has a number of islands, rivers, waterways and bridges that crisscross the city and has often been called "The Venice of Brazil". The city is located amidst [[tropical forest]]s which are distinguished by high rainfall levels, resulting in poor [[soil quality]] as the heavy dense rainfall washes away the nutrients. There is an absence of extreme temperatures and the area enjoys a cool breeze due to the trade winds from the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] to the east.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.recife.info/recife-weather.html |title=Weather of Recife |access-date=November 2, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915120054/http://www.recife.info/recife-weather.html |archive-date=September 15, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Recife has a tropical forest. Rainforests are characterised by high rainfall, with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between {{convert|2000|mm|in}} and {{convert|1700|mm|in}}. The soil can be poor because high rainfall tends to leach out soluble nutrients. There are several common characteristics of tropical [[rainforest]] trees.

The city of Recife is formed by three islands (Recife, Santo Antônio, and Boa Vista).<ref>[http://www.nassauturismo.com.br/nac_pacotes_recife.htm Islands of Recife]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Between the islands are the rivers Beberibe and Capibaribe.<ref>[http://www.unicap.br/eneal/html/turismo.html Rivers of the city] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330014650/http://www.unicap.br/eneal/html/turismo.html |date=March 30, 2009 }}</ref> Other rivers are the Jiquiá, Tejipió, Jordão and Pina.

===Climate===
Recife has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (''Am'') under the [[Köppen climate classification]], with warm to hot temperatures and high relative humidity throughout the year. However, these conditions are relieved by pleasant westwardly [[trade wind]]s blowing in from the ocean.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cdsid.org.br/gdn2012/recife.php |title=GDN 2012<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=December 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426052010/http://www.cdsid.org.br/gdn2012/recife.php |archive-date=April 26, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> January and February are the warmest months, with mean temperatures ranging from {{convert|31|C|F}} to {{convert|22|C|F}}, with sun.

The four-day period before the [[Christianity|Christian]] liturgical preparatory season [[Lent]] leading up to [[Shrove Tuesday]] and [[Ash Wednesday]] is [[carnival]] time in Brazil. Rich and poor alike forget their cares as they gaily party in the streets. [[Pernambuco]] has large Carnival celebrations with more than 3000 shows in the streets of the historic centre performed by over 430 local groups, including the [[Frevo]], typical [[Pernambuco]] music. Another famous carnival music style from Pernambuco is Maracatu. The cities of Recife and [[Olinda]] hold the most authentic and democratic [[Brazilian Carnival]] celebrations. The largest carnival in Brazil is Galo da Madrugada, which takes place in [[Recife Antigo|Downtown Recife]] on Carnival Saturday. Another famous event is the "Noite dos Tambores Silenciosos." (literally, Night of the Silent Drums) Carnival. Recife's Carnival is nationally known, attracting thousands of visitors every year.

The party starts a week before the official date, with electric trios "shaking" the [[Boa Viagem, Recife|Boa Viagem]] neighborhood. On Friday, people take to the streets to dance to the sound of frevo and to dance with maracatu, ciranda, caboclinhos, afoxé, reggae and manguebeat groups. There are still many other entertainment centers spread out around the city, featuring local and national artists. One of the highlights is Saturday when more than two and a half million people follow the [[Galo da Madrugada]] group.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130624215346/http://www.pinpads.co/short-term-rentals/recife/apartment/172341 Carnival in Recife] {{in lang|en}}</ref> Every day, there is the Night of the Silent Drums, on the Pátio do Terço, where [[Maracatu]]s honor [[slave]]s that died in prisons.<ref>[http://othersiderainbow.blogspot.com.br/2008_01_06_archive.html Maracatu in Recife] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705185911/http://othersiderainbow.blogspot.com.br/2008_01_06_archive.html |date=July 5, 2014 }} {{in lang|en}}</ref>

"Frevo" was born from the confluence of [[White Brazilian|European]] and [[Afro-Brazilian]] [[Culture of Brazil|cultures]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2007/02/12/recife-brazil-trumpeting-100-years-of-frevo-and-musical-innovation-on-the-eve-of-carnival/ |title=Frevo |access-date=July 14, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708231022/http://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2007/02/12/recife-brazil-trumpeting-100-years-of-frevo-and-musical-innovation-on-the-eve-of-carnival/ |archive-date=July 8, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> as probably did all the other musical genres consolidated in Brazil.

He was referring to the technical hardship of this kind of music, and stressing the role of conductors who led the 'frevistical' troupes.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Rafael|title=O que fazer em Recife?

Also known as ''Recife Audiovisual Festival'' or ''Cine-PE'', Recife Cinema Festival is a competitive film and audiovisual festival. It is dedicated to the Brazilian and [[Pernambuco|state]] production of [[feature film|feature]] & short films; as well as [[Streaming media|videos]] and documentaries. It was founded in 1997 by Alfredo & Sandra Bertini, who have been the directors since then. Between 1997 and 2008, 1806 films have been shown<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cine-pe.com.br/cinepe_2009/home/index.php |title=Recife cinema festival |access-date=September 3, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225031945/http://www.cine-pe.com.br/cinepe_2009/home/index.php |archive-date=December 25, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> (through either competitive applications or National & International invitations), of all types and genres, for a public of over 250,000.

''Recife'' and consequently [[Pernambuco]] has a tradition in the Brazilian film making history. In the pioneer times of the Brazilian cinema emerged the ''Regional movements''. One of those, was designated Ciclo de Recife<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fundaj.gov.br/notitia/servlet/newstorm.ns.presentation.NavigationServlet?publicationCode=16&pageCode=377&textCode=6763&date=currentDate |title=Fundação Joaquim Nabuco |access-date=September 3, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610213702/http://www.fundaj.gov.br/notitia/servlet/newstorm.ns.presentation.NavigationServlet?publicationCode=16&pageCode=377&textCode=6763&date=currentDate |archive-date=June 10, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ('''Recife cycle'''), between 1922 and 1931. Despite adverse conditions, during this cycle 13 feature films were produced in Recife (usually about drama & romance) and 7 documentary films (usually ordered by authorities to show their public works). Despite the pervasive influence of [[Cinema of the United States|US]] and [[European cinema]]s in the [[silent film]] times, the Recife cycle was one of the most important and productive regional movements. One of the most important films was [[Aitaré da Praia]], which is recognised for pioneering the rise of regional themes (1925). Other successful films were ''Retribuição'' (1923) and ''A Filha do Advogado'' (1926). Another important phase of the Pernambuco/Recife film history was in the 1970s with a movement called [[Super 8mm film|Super 8]], often used for home videos and documentaries made by students, amateurs and aspirant film makers, due to the utilisation of 8&nbsp;mm film, using the new technology released by [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]].<ref>[http://www.enotes.com/topic/Recife_Cinema_Festival Study Guides, Reference Materials for Science, Literature, History & more – eNotes.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Recife [[cuisine]] is the cuisine of its region, [[Pernambuco]] and the Northeast, and the culinary influences of the area can be traced to a dynamic assortment of cultures: the [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]], [[Dutch Brazilian|Dutch]], [[Spanish immigration to Brazil|Spanish]], [[Moors]], [[Afro-Brazilian|Africans]] and [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Indigenous]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.geographia.com/brazil/recife/cuisine.htm |title=Cuisine of Recife |access-date=July 14, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629052343/http://www.geographia.com/brazil/recife/cuisine.htm |archive-date=June 29, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Many dishes come with a delicious [[coconut]] sauce, [[palm oil]] (dendê) and feature corn, [[manioc]] roots, [[yam (vegetable)|yam]], fresh seafood (shrimp, crab, lobster cooked with exotic sauces) and native fruits. Grilled meats are also widely served, especially goat and beef dishes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ww2.panaftosa.org.br/cosalfa38/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=50&Itemid=71&lang=en |title=Recife – Pernambuco<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=December 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406064612/http://ww2.panaftosa.org.br/cosalfa38/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=50&Itemid=71&lang=en |archive-date=April 6, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Football in [[Pernambuco]] began in 1902, when English and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] sailors landed in Recife and played a game of football on the beach. The new game aroused the interest of the people of Pernambuco, and they soon started playing.

Recife provides visitors and residents with various sporting activities. There are several football clubs based in Recife, such as [[Sport Club do Recife|Sport]] the current 2023 State Champion (43 times state champion and once national champion (1987) and Brazil's Cup champion (2008)), [[Santa Cruz Futebol Clube|Santa Cruz]] (29 times state champion) and [[Clube Náutico Capibaribe|Náutico]] (23 times state champion and unique 6 consecutives). The [[Campeonato Pernambucano]] (Pernambuco's State Championship) is divided into Taça Revolução and Taça Confederação. They both have the same format: standard round-robin, in which all teams play each other once. A round-robin tournament or all-play-all [[tournament]] is a type of group tournament in which each participant plays every other participant an equal number of times. If a team wins both Taça Tabocas e Guararapes and Taça Confederação do Equador, it is crowned the [[States of Brazil|state]] [[champion]]. If not, a home-and-away playoff with the [[champion|winners]] is disputed, and the winner is declared the state champion.

Also, the city has traditions in another sports as:
Basketball, Hockey, Golf, Tenis, Table tennis, Volleyball, beach volley, Handball, Surf, Skateboard, Bodysurf, Swimning pool and Futsal. Provided by clubs such as:
Nautico, Sport, Santa Cruz, Portuguese Club of Recife, Caxanga Golf & Country Club, Mauricio de Nassau University, School of Tenis Recife as others.

Recife was one of the 12 cities chosen to host games for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], for which Brazil was the host nation. The [[Recife metropolitan area|Metropolitan Recife]] project consisted of a new Sports City constructed in [[São Lourenço da Mata]] in an intersection area near to Recife, [[Jaboatão dos Guararapes]] and [[Camaragibe]]. The new Sports complex is {{convert|19|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of Recife city centre and {{convert|19|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Airport.

The sports complex 'City'<ref>[https://archive.today/20110106193623/http://200.238.107.167/web/portalpe/exibirartigo?companyId=communis.com.br&articleId=16353 Recife Sports City 2014 in Pernambuco State site (Portuguese)]</ref> was constructed with a [[Itaipava Arena Pernambuco|new stadium]] with 45,000 seats, 9,000 flats, 6,000 car parking spaces, 1 hospital, 1 technical school, 1 shopping centre, 1 integrated metro/bus station and improvement of federal roads, all with an estimated cost of R$1.6&nbsp;billion.

This was the second time Recife has been chosen to be one of the host cities of the [[FIFA World Cup]]. In [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]], Recife hosted just one game, between [[Chile]] and the United States, at Ilha do Retiro Stadium. At this time, it was the only city to represent the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]] of Brazil.

[[File:Quartel do Derby.jpg|thumb|280px|right|General Headquarters Command of Pernambuco Military Police.]]

In 2013, Recife had the 38th highest [[homicide rate]] in [[Americas|The Americas]], after Detroit, [[New Orleans]], [[Baltimore]], [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] and other cities.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.seguridadjusticiaypaz.org.mx/sala-de-prensa/941-por-tercer-ano-consecutivo-san-pedro-sula-es-la-ciudad-mas-violenta-del-mundo |title=Por tercer año consecutivo, San Pedro Sula es la ciudad más violenta del mundo |access-date=March 31, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324111128/http://www.seguridadjusticiaypaz.org.mx/sala-de-prensa/941-por-tercer-ano-consecutivo-san-pedro-sula-es-la-ciudad-mas-violenta-del-mundo |archive-date=March 24, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

'''PESP plan'''

The State Governor [[Eduardo Campos]] introduced the PESP plan (Security state Plan – Plano Estadual de Segurança Pública) on May 2, 2009. This aimed<ref>[http://200.238.107.167/web/portalpe/programas?id=727 Miolo_2.pdf PESP plan in Fifa 2014 project page 26] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310133850/http://200.238.107.167/web/portalpe/programas?id=727 |date=March 10, 2009 }}</ref> to reduce homicides by 12% each year until they reached half of the previous rate. The plan was based on the fact that 60% of murders were committed by people related to criminal activities and embraces both prevention and correction.

'''Carnival security plan'''

In 2007 ISS servers managed 50 Pelco Spectra PTZ cameras to capture all activity within areas of the city used for Carnival. Continued deployment of this [[project]] in Recife aimed to install over 1000 cameras in the city. Immediate statistics during the Carnival period indicated a reduction in [[violent crime]] of over 30%.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://acertodecontas.blog.br/atualidades/projeto-preve-instalacao-de-cameras-no-recife-para-combater-violencia/ |title=Security plan of Recife |access-date=November 2, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706152856/http://acertodecontas.blog.br/atualidades/projeto-preve-instalacao-de-cameras-no-recife-para-combater-violencia/ |archive-date=July 6, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.recife.pe.gov.br/2007/12/18/mat_149233.php |title=City hall website – Security plan |access-date=November 2, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706160431/http://www.recife.pe.gov.br/2007/12/18/mat_149233.php |archive-date=July 6, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Recuperation program===
[[UNICEF]] is an international development agency, which supports locally initiated projects with an emphasis on children. Recife offered an environment to utilise its rich cultural heritage to develop programs aimed at its most serious issues. One of the most hands-on projects was a radio program named "Jovens Comunicadores" (Communicating Youth).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.redeandibrasil.org.br/hotsite/em-pauta/trabalho-pernambucano-concorre-a-premio-nacional/ |title=Jovens Comunicadores in Recife, Pernambuco |access-date=November 13, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127101658/http://www.redeandibrasil.org.br/hotsite/em-pauta/trabalho-pernambucano-concorre-a-premio-nacional |archive-date=November 27, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It trained a group of eighteen adolescents to produce a weekly radio program focusing on [[child labour]]. The program is recorded and sent to community radio stations, most of which are broadcast in the sugar cane area where many children work. Jovens Comunicadores advocates and lobbies against exploitation. All programs are produced and edited by teens. As a radio program, it also plays regional music, giving a boost to [[Culture of Brazil|local culture]].<ref>[http://www.blog.educacaoeparticipacao.org.br/?p=18 Jovens Comunicadores Program Blog]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

"Criança Feliz" (Happy Child) had the same objective, eliminating child exploitation, but used a different approach. It was begun by a women's organisation and offered after-school activities with the goal of discouraging children and adolescents from working in sex tourism. Besides giving classes and training in computers, English, art, and karate, it also offered psychological services and [[group therapy]]. These combined services sought to equip children not only with skills but also a positive self-image and respect to not fall into prostitution. As all the kids came from very poor backgrounds, the financial pull of prostitution was very high. Criança Feliz worked at educating them about the high costs in the long term. This was a very interesting project, since it was actually a house with groups of kids divided into participating in different activities.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070522021905/http://www.projetocriancafelizbrasil.com.br/ Criança Feliz Program]</ref>

===Shark attacks===
[[File:Signs warning of shark attacks at Boa Viagem Beach in Recife, Brazil.jpg|thumb|280px|Signs warning of shark attacks at Boa Viagem Beach.]]
[[File:Praia_de_Boa_Viagem_,_Pernambuco.jpg|thumb|280px|Natural pools – Boa Viagem Beach.]]
[[Shark attacks]] are a recurrent problem in [[Recife metropolitan area]]. They were addressed in the [[National Geographic Channel]] series ''[[Hunter Hunted (TV series)|Hunter Hunted]]'' in the episode "Shark Invasion." [[Surfing]] has been outlawed since 1995 on the urban beaches (Pina, [[Boa Viagem, Recife|Boa Viagem]], Piedade, and Candeias) because of the risk the sport poses to its practitioners due to shark attacks. It is strongly recommended that bathers not climb over and swim beyond the reefs because of strong, unpredictable currents and the possible presence of [[bull sharks]]. Several beaches have messages alerting people to the danger of [[shark]]s.

Before the 1990s there had been virtually no attacks reported here.

Scientists believe most of these attacks are committed by two species, [[bull shark]]s and [[tiger shark]]s, but forensic evidence has only been able to confirm the species responsible in eight of these attacks. Bull sharks are considered to be one of the most dangerous shark species, with many proven attacks against humans. There are almost two million people in Recife and surrounding areas, and there are many beaches conveniently located in and around the city, but some {{convert|700|m|abbr=off}} off the coast there is a deep trench running parallel to the beaches. Sharks use this trench as a migratory route and emerge from it to hunt in the shallows. Other facts contribute to the appearance of sharks in the area of Boa Viagem Beach: the marine currents direct the animals for that stretch of 20 kilometers. A sand bank extends into the sea about a thousand meters from Recife's beaches. Between this long strip, with depth between 1 and 3 meters, and the beach a deep channel is formed (between 5 and 8 meters),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diariodepernambuco.com.br/app/noticia/vida-urbana/2017/11/21/interna_vidaurbana,731668/ataques-de-tubarao-25-anos-de-medo-nas-praias.shtml |title=Ataques de tubarão: 25 anos de medo nas praias |publisher=Diário de Pernambuco |date=November 21, 2017 |access-date=December 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223220622/http://www.diariodepernambuco.com.br/app/noticia/vida-urbana/2017/11/21/interna_vidaurbana,731668/ataques-de-tubarao-25-anos-de-medo-nas-praias.shtml |archive-date=December 23, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> which becomes a kind of refectory for sharks, since it attracts several species of rays, one of the prey of sharks. The presence of so many prey in that area makes the sharks stay closer to the beaches for longer and when the shark enters these channels, there is a great risk of contact with people.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

It is Recife's Port Suape, though, that many see as the biggest cause of the recent attacks. Located {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=off}} south of Boa Viagem Beach, where most of the attacks have occurred, the port has been the cause of much disturbance for marine life along the coast and the nearby estuaries. To facilitate its initial construction, in the late 1970s, two freshwater estuaries, which had discharged into the Atlantic Ocean were sealed off.{{cn|date=November 2022}} The port opened for business in 1984, (and today handles more than four million tonnes of cargo per year) but it was not until 1992 that it began to attract significant shipping traffic. The passage of large vessels on the coast of Recife attracts sharks, by clearing organic waste in the waters of the sea. Before 1992, Recife had no more shark attacks than any other beach in Brazil, but the change was immediate and dramatic.{{cn|date=November 2022}}

To build the port, [[estuaries]] were dredged and long docks built, protruding out into the ocean. This is especially a problem for bull sharks, who generally stay close to land and are able to tolerate [[fresh water]] (they are regularly encountered in rivers such as the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]]). Much of their [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] is dependent on coastal estuaries and the building of Suape is thought to have disrupted breeding and hunting habits. The destruction of the mangrove and the rectification of rivers, have also contributed to the imbalance of the ecological balance. Most sharks use the mangroves at least once in life to breed or feed. The destruction of the mangrove swamps where the Suape port was built caused the bull shark females that used the place to procreate migrate to the estuary of the Jaboatão River, to the north. This river flows exactly into the beaches of Recife.

Cemit, the Council for Shark Hazard Monitoring, conducts a catch-and-release program to remove the sharks from beaches. 81 sharks were caught{{when|date=March 2015}}, tagged with tracking devices, and released far out to sea. Its [[GPS]] data on the sharks tagged show that after being caught, all tiger sharks have migrated to other regions. To get the sharks further out to sea, Cemit in 2006 sank three boats on the far side of the ocean trench to create an artificial reef. This was to attract fish to congregate around the boats so that sharks coming out of the trench to hunt would move away from the beach.<ref name="nome" /> The Council for Shark Hazard Monitoring (Cemit), recommends the following precautions to prevent the attack of sharks on beaches in Recife: Avoid bathing between sunset and sunrise. It is in this period that sharks are most active. Do not enter the sea when the tide is full. Hungry sharks get across the reef if there is enough water flowing over them. Avoid swimming alone and when the water is cloudy. Do not enter the water above the waist and do not swim in the open sea.<ref name="name" />
	
In 1995, the Pernambuco government prohibited the practice of water sports on 32&nbsp;km of coastline in the Metropolitan Region of Recife. This ban resulted in the reduction of incidents with sharks thereafter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diariodepernambuco.com.br/app/noticia/vida-urbana/2015/03/31/interna_vidaurbana,568984/vinte-anos-apos-a-proibicao-de-esportes-nauticos-governo-desiste-de-instalar-tela-de-protecao.shtml |title=Vinte anos após a proibição de esportes náuticos, governo desiste de instalar tela de proteção |publisher=Diário de Pernambuco |date=March 31, 2015 |access-date=December 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224102042/http://www.diariodepernambuco.com.br/app/noticia/vida-urbana/2015/03/31/interna_vidaurbana,568984/vinte-anos-apos-a-proibicao-de-esportes-nauticos-governo-desiste-de-instalar-tela-de-protecao.shtml |archive-date=December 24, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The state-funded investigation has focused on the long-term ecological [[Result|effect]]s of the new port of Suape. Based on its findings, local [[Human rights in Brazil|human rights]] lawyers are considering a symbolic legal challenge to the [[Pernambuco|State of Pernambuco]], with the aim of securing compensation for the victims of attacks.
