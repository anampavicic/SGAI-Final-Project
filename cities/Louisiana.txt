More elevated areas, particularly in the north, contain a wide variety of ecosystems such as [[Western Gulf coastal grasslands|tallgrass prairie]], [[longleaf pine]] forest and wet [[savanna]]s; these support an exceptionally large number of plant species, including many species of terrestrial [[Orchidaceae|orchid]]s and [[carnivorous plant]]s. Over half the state is forested.

Louisiana is situated at the confluence of the [[Mississippi River System|Mississippi river system]] and the Gulf of Mexico. Its location and biodiversity attracted various indigenous groups thousands of years before Europeans arrived in the 17th century. Louisiana has eighteen Native American tribes—the most of any southern state—of which four are federally recognized and ten are state-recognized.<ref>[http://www.louisianafolklife.org/LT/Articles_Essays/nativeams.html "Louisiana Indians in the 21st Century"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223071934/http://www.louisianafolklife.org/LT/Articles_Essays/nativeams.html|date=December 23, 2017}}, Louisiana Folklife Program, 2013</ref> The French claimed the territory in 1682, and it became the political, commercial, and population center of the larger colony of [[New France]]. From 1762 to 1801 [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana]] was under Spanish rule, briefly returning to French rule before being [[Louisiana Purchase|sold]] by [[Napoleon]] to the U.S. in 1803. It was [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] in 1812 as the 18th state. Following statehood, Louisiana saw an influx of settlers from the eastern U.S. as well as immigrants from the West Indies, Germany, and Ireland. It experienced an agricultural boom, particularly in cotton and sugarcane, which were cultivated primarily by slaves from Africa. As a slave state, Louisiana was one of the original seven members of the [[Confederate States of America]] during the [[American Civil War]].

Louisiana's unique French heritage is reflected in its toponyms, dialects, customs, demographics, and legal system. Relative to the rest of the southern U.S., Louisiana is [[multilingualism|multilingual]] and multicultural, reflecting an admixture of [[Louisiana French people|Louisiana French]] ([[Cajuns|Cajun]], [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]]), [[Culture of Spain|Spanish]], [[Culture of Quebec|French Canadian]], [[Acadian people|Acadian]], [[Saint-Domingue Creoles|Saint-Domingue Creole]], [[State-recognized tribes#Louisiana|Native American]], and [[Culture of Africa|West African]] cultures (generally the descendants of [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves]] stolen in the 18th century); more recent migrants include [[Filipino Americans|Filipinos]] and Vietnamese. In the [[Reconstruction era|post–Civil War environment]], [[Anglo-Americans]] increased the pressure for [[Anglicization]], and in 1921, English was shortly made the sole language of instruction in Louisiana schools before a policy of multilingualism was revived in 1974.<ref name="LouisianaOfficialSiteLanguage">[http://www.crt.state.la.us/cultural-development/codofil/about/french-in-louisiana/legal-status/index Louisiana Official Site on Languages] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621185821/http://www.crt.state.la.us/cultural-development/codofil/about/french-in-louisiana/legal-status/index|date=June 21, 2015}}, accessed August 22, 2016</ref><ref name="murphy">{{Cite journal |last=Murphy |first=Alexander B. |year=2008<!--

==Etymology==
Louisiana was named after [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], King of France from 1643 to 1715. When [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] claimed the territory drained by the [[Mississippi River]] for France, he named it {{lang|fr|La Louisiane}}.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Arkansas]]|title=Louisiana Purchase|first=Lea Flowers|last=Baker|access-date=September 18, 2010|url=http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2383|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122041849/http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2383|archive-date=November 22, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> The suffix –ana (or –ane) is a Latin suffix that can refer to "information relating to a particular individual, subject, or place." Thus, roughly, Louis + ana carries the idea of "related to Louis." Once part of the [[French colonial empire]], the [[Louisiana Territory]] stretched from present-day Mobile Bay to just north of the present-day [[Canada–United States border]], including a small part of what are now the Canadian [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] of [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]].

The area of Louisiana is the place of origin of the [[Mound Builders]] culture during the Middle [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]], in the [[4th millennium BC]]. The sites of Caney and Frenchman's Bend have been securely dated to 5600–5000 [[Before Present|BP]] (about 3700–3100 BC), demonstrating that seasonal hunter-gatherers from around this time organized to build complex earthwork constructions in what is now northern Louisiana.

Nearly 2,000 years later, [[Poverty Point]] was built; it is the largest and best-known Late Archaic site in the state. The city of modern–day [[Epps, Louisiana|Epps]] developed near it. The [[Poverty Point culture]] may have reached its peak around 1500 BC, making it the first complex culture, and possibly the first tribal culture in North America.<ref>[http://www.deltablues.net/jon.html Jon L.

The first European explorers to visit Louisiana came in 1528 when a Spanish expedition led by [[Pánfilo de Narváez]] located the mouth of the Mississippi River. In 1542, [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]]'s expedition skirted to the north and west of the state (encountering Caddo and Tunica groups) and then followed the Mississippi River down to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in 1543. Spanish interest in Louisiana faded away for a century and a half.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/465605 |title=Route of the Hernando de Soto Expedition, 1539–1543 |publisher=National Park Service |date=December 1988 |access-date=18 October 2022 |pages=6, Appendix B |archive-date=September 20, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220920163452/https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/465605 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the late 17th century, French and [[French Canadian]] expeditions, which included sovereign, religious and commercial aims, established a foothold on the Mississippi River and Gulf Coast. With its first settlements, France laid claim to a vast region of North America and set out to establish a commercial empire and French nation stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada.

In 1682, the French explorer [[Robert Cavelier de La Salle]] named the region Louisiana to honor [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]] of France. The first permanent settlement, Fort Maurepas (now [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]]), was founded in 1699 by [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]], a French military officer from [[New France]]. By then the French had also built a small fort at the mouth of the Mississippi at a settlement they named [[La Balize, Louisiana|La Balise (or La Balize)]], "[[sea mark|seamark]]" in French. By 1721, they built a {{convert|62|ft|m|adj=on}} wooden lighthouse-type structure here to guide ships on the river.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lch/research/la18hu.php#18 |first=David |last=Roth |title=Louisiana Hurricane History: 18th century (1722–1800) |publisher=Tropical Weather—National Weather Service—Lake Charles, Louisiana |date=2003 |access-date=May 7, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805171217/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lch/research/la18hu.php#18 |archive-date=August 5, 2009}}</ref>

A royal ordinance of 1722—following the Crown's transfer of the [[Illinois Country]]'s governance from Canada to Louisiana—may have featured the broadest definition of Louisiana: all land claimed by France south of the [[Great Lakes]] between the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Allegheny Mountains|Alleghenies]].<ref name="Ekberg-French Roots">{{cite book|last=Ekberg|first=Carl|title=French Roots in the Illinois Country: The Mississippi Frontier in Colonial Times|date=2000|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana and Chicago, Ill.|isbn=9780252069246|pages=32–33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NOdf3FRXms0C&pg=PA216|access-date=November 29, 2014|archive-date=February 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210220153427/https://books.google.com/books?id=NOdf3FRXms0C&pg=PA216|url-status=live}}</ref> A generation later, trade conflicts between Canada and Louisiana led to a more defined boundary between the French colonies; in 1745, Louisiana governor general [[Pierre de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial|Vaudreuil]] set the northern and eastern bounds of his domain as the [[Wabash River|Wabash]] valley up to the mouth of the [[Vermilion River (Wabash River tributary)|Vermilion River]] (near present-day [[Danville, Illinois]]); from there, northwest to [[Starved Rock State Park|''le Rocher'']] on the [[Illinois River]], and from there west to the mouth of the [[Rock River (Mississippi River)|Rock River]] (at present day [[Rock Island, Illinois]]).<ref name="Ekberg-French Roots" /> Thus, [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]] and [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]] were the limit of Louisiana's reach; the outposts at [[Ouiatenon]] (on the upper Wabash near present-day [[Lafayette, Indiana]]), Chicago, [[Fort Miami (Indiana)|Fort Miami]]s (near present-day [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]), and [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin]], operated as dependencies of Canada.<ref name="Ekberg-French Roots" />

The settlement of [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]] (along the Red River in present-day northwest Louisiana) was established in 1714 by [[Louis Juchereau de St. Denis]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Dunn. "History of Natchitoches."|url=https://www2.latech.edu/~bmagee/louisiana_anthology/texts/dunn-m/dunn--history_of_natchitoches.html|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-07|website=LA Tech University|archive-date=June 7, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210607164455/https://www2.latech.edu/~bmagee/louisiana_anthology/texts/dunn-m/dunn--history_of_natchitoches.html}}</ref> making it the oldest permanent European settlement in the modern state of Louisiana. The French settlement had two purposes: to establish trade with the Spanish in [[Texas]] via the Old San Antonio Road, and to deter Spanish advances into Louisiana. The settlement soon became a flourishing river port and crossroads, giving rise to vast cotton kingdoms along the river that were worked by imported African slaves. Over time, planters developed large plantations and built fine homes in a growing town. This became a pattern repeated in New Orleans and other places, although the commodity crop in the south was primarily sugar cane.

[[File:Atchafalaya Basin.jpg|thumb|French Acadians, who came to be known as [[Cajuns]], settled in southern Louisiana, especially along the banks of its major bayous.]]
Louisiana's French settlements contributed to further exploration and outposts, concentrated along the banks of the Mississippi and its major tributaries, from Louisiana to as far north as the region called the [[Illinois Country]], around present-day [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. The latter was settled by French colonists from Illinois.

Initially, [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] and then [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] served as the capital of La Louisiane.<ref>{{cite web|date=February 1, 2018|title=LA claims 1st Mardi Gras; here's what really happened|url=https://www.al.com/living/2018/02/louisiana_again_claiming_1st_m.html|access-date=2021-06-07|website=al|language=en|archive-date=February 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200223141703/https://www.al.com/living/2018/02/louisiana_again_claiming_1st_m.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=History of Biloxi, Mississippi|url=https://biloxi.ms.us/visitor-info/history/|access-date=2021-06-07|website=City of Biloxi Government|language=en-US|archive-date=June 2, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602034923/https://biloxi.ms.us/visitor-info/history/|url-status=live}}</ref> Recognizing the importance of the Mississippi River to trade and military interests, and wanting to protect the capital from severe coastal storms, France developed New Orleans from 1722 as the seat of civilian and military authority south of the Great Lakes. From then until the United States acquired the territory in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, France and Spain jockeyed for control of New Orleans and the lands west of the Mississippi.

In the 1720s, German immigrants settled along the Mississippi River, in a region referred to as the [[German Coast]].

France ceded most of its territory east of the Mississippi to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in 1763, in the aftermath of [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War]] (generally referred to in North America as the [[French and Indian War]]). This included the lands along the Gulf Coast and north of Lake Pontchartrain to the Mississippi River, which became known as British West Florida. The rest of Louisiana west of the Mississippi, as well as the "isle of New Orleans", had become a colony of Spain by the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)]]. The transfer of power on either side of the river would be delayed until later in the decade.

In 1765, during Spanish rule, several thousand [[Acadians]] from the French colony of [[Acadia]] (now [[Nova Scotia]], New Brunswick, and [[Prince Edward Island]]) made their way to Louisiana after having been [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expelled]] from Acadia by the British government after the French and Indian War.

[[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville]] brought the first two African slaves to Louisiana in 1708, transporting them from a French colony in the West Indies. In 1709, French financier [[Antoine Crozat]] obtained a monopoly of commerce in [[La Louisiane]], which extended from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to what is now [[Illinois]]. According to historian [[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]], "that concession allowed him to bring in a cargo of blacks from Africa every year".<ref>''The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440–1870'' by Hugh Thomas. 1997: Simon and Schuster. p. 242-43</ref>
Starting in 1719, traders began to import slaves in higher numbers; two French ships, the ''Du Maine'' and the ''Aurore'', arrived in New Orleans carrying more than 500 black slaves coming from Africa. Previous slaves in Louisiana had been transported from French colonies in the West Indies. By the end of 1721, New Orleans counted 1,256 inhabitants, of whom about half were slaves.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

In 1724, the French government issued a law called the [[Code Noir]] ("Black Code" in English) which regulated the interaction of whites (blancs) and blacks (noirs) in its colony of Louisiana (which was much larger than the current state of Louisiana). After the [[Sale of Louisiana]], French Law survived in the Louisiana, such as the prohibition and outlaw of any cruel punishment. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.knowlouisiana.org/entry/code-noir-of-louisiana|title=Code Noir of Louisiana—Know Louisiana|access-date=April 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518041714/http://www.knowlouisiana.org/entry/code-noir-of-louisiana|archive-date=May 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=The law of slavery—Master–slave legal relationships |url=https://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24164 |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007003400/https://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24164 |archive-date=October 7, 2014 }}</ref>

When the United States [[Louisiana Purchase|purchased Louisiana]] in 1803, it was soon accepted that slaves could be brought to Louisiana as easily as they were brought to neighboring [[Mississippi]], though it violated U.S. law to do so.<ref name="The Slave Trade p. 548">Hugh Thomas, ''The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440–1870'', Simon and Schuster, 1997, p. 548.</ref> Despite demands by United States Rep. [[James Hillhouse]] and by the pamphleteer [[Thomas Paine]] to enforce existing federal law against slavery in the newly acquired territory,<ref name="The Slave Trade p. 548" /> slavery prevailed because it was the source of great profits and the lowest-cost labor.

At the start of the 19th century, Louisiana was a small producer of sugar with a relatively small number of slaves, compared to [[Saint-Domingue]] and the West Indies. It soon thereafter became a major sugar producer as new settlers arrived to develop plantations. [[William C. C. Claiborne]], Louisiana's first United States governor, said African slave labor was needed because white laborers "cannot be had in this unhealthy climate."<ref>Thomas (1997), ''The Slave Trade'', p. 549.</ref> Hugh Thomas wrote that Claiborne was unable to enforce the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade, which the U.S. and Great Britain enacted in 1807. The United States continued to protect the domestic slave trade, including the coastwise trade—the transport of slaves by ship along the Atlantic Coast and to New Orleans and other Gulf ports.

By 1840, New Orleans had the biggest slave market in the United States, which contributed greatly to the economy of the city and of the state. New Orleans had become one of the wealthiest cities, and the third largest city, in the nation.<ref>Walter Johnson, ''Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999, p.2</ref> The ban on the African slave trade and importation of slaves had increased demand in the domestic market. During the decades after the American Revolutionary War, more than one million enslaved African Americans underwent forced migration from the Upper South to the Deep South, two thirds of them in the slave trade. Others were transported by their owners as slaveholders moved west for new lands.<ref>[http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/landing.cfm?migration=3 In Motion: The African-American Migration Experience—The Domestic Slave Trade, New York Public Library, Schomburg Center for Study of Black Culture, 2002] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104201729/http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/landing.cfm?migration=3 |date=November 4, 2013 }}, accessed April 27, 2008</ref><ref>Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619–1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1994, pp. 96–98</ref>

With changing agriculture in the Upper South as planters shifted from tobacco to less labor-intensive mixed agriculture, planters had excess laborers. Many sold slaves to traders to take to the Deep South. Slaves were driven by traders overland from the Upper South or transported to New Orleans and other coastal markets by ship in the [[coastwise slave trade]]. After sales in New Orleans, steamboats operating on the Mississippi transported slaves upstream to markets or plantation destinations at Natchez and Memphis.

Unusually for a slave-state, Louisiana harbored escaped Filipino slaves from the [[Manila Galleon]]s.<ref name="Bishops2001">{{cite book|author=Catholic Church.

===Purchase by the United States===
{{Main|Louisiana Purchase|Territory of Orleans|Republic of West Florida|Neutral Ground (Louisiana)}}
When the United States won its independence from Great Britain in 1783, one of its major concerns was having a European power on its western boundary, and the need for unrestricted access to the Mississippi River. As American settlers pushed west, they found that the [[Appalachian Mountains]] provided a barrier to shipping goods eastward. The easiest way to ship produce was to use a [[flatboat]] to float it down the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and Mississippi rivers to the port of New Orleans, where goods could be put on ocean-going vessels. The problem with this route was that the Spanish owned both sides of the Mississippi below [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]].

Napoleon's ambitions in Louisiana involved the creation of a new empire centered on the [[Caribbean]] [[sugar trade]]. By the terms of the [[Treaty of Amiens]] of 1802, Great Britain returned control of the islands of [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]] to the French. Napoleon looked upon Louisiana as a depot for these sugar islands, and as a buffer to U.S. settlement. In October 1801 he sent a large military force to take back Saint-Domingue, then under control of Toussaint Louverture after the [[Haitian Revolution]]. When the army led by Napoleon's brother-in-law Leclerc was defeated, Napoleon decided to sell Louisiana.<ref>{{cite web|last=Blakemore|first=Erin|title=Why France Sold the Louisiana Purchase to the US|url=https://www.history.com/news/louisiana-purchase-price-french-colonial-slave-rebellion|access-date=2021-06-07|website=HISTORY|date=August 23, 2018 |language=en|archive-date=May 12, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210512093700/https://www.history.com/news/louisiana-purchase-price-french-colonial-slave-rebellion|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Thomas Jefferson]], third president of the United States, was disturbed by Napoleon's plans to re-establish French colonies in North America. With the possession of New Orleans, Napoleon could close the Mississippi to U.S. commerce at any time. Jefferson authorized [[Robert Livingston (1746–1813)|Robert R. Livingston]], U.S. minister to France, to negotiate for the purchase of the city of New Orleans, portions of the east bank of the Mississippi,<ref>{{cite web|title=Founders Online: From Thomas Jefferson to Robert R. Livingston, 18 April 1802|url=http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-37-02-0220|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-07|website=National Archives and Records Administration|language=en|archive-date=May 6, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210506133626/https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-37-02-0220}}</ref> and free navigation of the river for U.S. commerce. Livingston was authorized to pay up to $2{{spaces}}million.

An official transfer of Louisiana to French ownership had not yet taken place, and Napoleon's deal with the Spanish was a poorly kept secret on the frontier. On October 18, 1802, however, Juan Ventura Morales, acting intendant of Louisiana, made public the intention of Spain to revoke the right of deposit at New Orleans for all cargo from the United States. The closure of this vital port to the United States caused anger and consternation. Commerce in the west was virtually blockaded. Historians believe the revocation of the right of deposit was prompted by abuses by the Americans, particularly smuggling, and not by French intrigues as was believed at the time. President Jefferson ignored public pressure for war with France, and appointed [[James Monroe]] a special envoy to Napoleon, to assist in obtaining New Orleans for the United States. Jefferson also raised the authorized expenditure to $10{{spaces}}million.<ref name=":5">{{cite web|title=The Louisiana Purchase|url=https://www.monticello.org/thomas-jefferson/louisiana-lewis-clark/the-louisiana-purchase/|access-date=2021-06-07|website=Monticello|language=en|archive-date=March 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321075505/https://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/louisiana-purchase|url-status=live}}</ref>

However, on April 11, 1803, French foreign minister [[Talleyrand]] surprised Livingston by asking how much the United States was prepared to pay for the entirety of Louisiana, not just New Orleans and the surrounding area (as Livingston's instructions covered). Monroe agreed with Livingston that Napoleon might withdraw this offer at any time (leaving them with no ability to obtain the desired New Orleans area), and that approval from President Jefferson might take months, so Livingston and Monroe decided to open negotiations immediately. By April 30, they closed a deal for the purchase of the entire Louisiana territory of {{convert|828000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} for sixty million [[French franc|Francs]] (approximately $15{{spaces}}million).<ref name=":5" />

Part of this sum, $3.5{{spaces}}million, was used to forgive debts owed by France to the United States.<ref>Peter Kastor, ''The Nation's Crucible: The Louisiana Purchase and the Creation of America'', (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004) 40</ref> The payment was made in United States [[Government bond|bonds]], which Napoleon sold at face value to the Dutch firm of [[Hope & Co.|Hope and Company]], and the [[Barings Bank|British banking house of Baring]], at a discount of {{frac|87|1|2}} per each $100 unit.<!--recte "percent"?--> As a result, France received only $8,831,250 in cash for Louisiana. English banker [[Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton|Alexander Baring]] conferred with Marbois in Paris, shuttled to the United States to pick up the bonds, took them to Britain, and returned to France with the money—which Napoleon used to wage war against Baring's own country.
[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Louisiana Purchase, 1803.jpg|thumb|Louisiana Purchase, 1803]]

When news of the purchase reached the United States, Jefferson was surprised. He had authorized the expenditure of $10{{spaces}}million for a port city, and instead received treaties committing the government to spend $15{{spaces}}million on a land package which would double the size of the country. Jefferson's political opponents in the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]] argued the Louisiana purchase was a worthless desert,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AsY9Vh9X8ZYC&q=worthless+desert |title=The American pageant: a history of the republic—Thomas A.

What really worried the opposition was the new states which would inevitably be carved from the Louisiana territory, strengthening western and southern interests in [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], and further reducing the influence of New England Federalists in national affairs. President Jefferson was an enthusiastic supporter of westward expansion, and held firm in his support for the treaty. Despite Federalist objections, the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] ratified the Louisiana treaty on October 20, 1803.

By statute enacted on October 31, 1803, President Thomas Jefferson was authorized to take possession of the territories ceded by France and provide for initial governance.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774–1875|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=282|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220085715/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=282|archive-date=December 20, 2016|access-date=December 2, 2019|website=Library of Congress}}</ref> A transfer ceremony was held in New Orleans on November 29, 1803. Since the Louisiana territory had never officially been turned over to the French, the Spanish took down their flag, and the French raised theirs. The following day, [[General James Wilkinson]] accepted possession of New Orleans for the United States. The Louisiana Territory, purchased for less than three cents an acre, doubled the size of the United States overnight, without a war or the loss of a single American life, and set a precedent for the purchase of territory. It opened the way for the eventual expansion of the United States across the continent to the Pacific Ocean.

Shortly after the United States took possession, the area was divided into two territories along the [[33rd parallel north]] on March 26, 1804, thereby organizing the [[Territory of Orleans]] to the south and the [[District of Louisiana]] (subsequently formed as the [[Louisiana Territory]]) to the north.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774–1875|url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=320|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220091706/http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=320|archive-date=December 20, 2016|access-date=December 2, 2019|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>

The state was quickly defeated in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], a result of Union strategy to cut the Confederacy in two by controlling the [[Mississippi River]]. Federal troops captured New Orleans on April 25, 1862.

=== Post–Civil War to mid–20th century ===
[[File:State of Louisiana 1892.jpg|thumb|Consolidated Bond of the State of Louisiana, issued 6. July 1892]]
Following the American Civil War and emancipation of slaves, violence rose in the southern U.S. as the war was carried on by insurgent private and paramilitary groups. During the initial period after the war, there was a massive rise in black participation in terms of voting and [[African-American officeholders during and following the Reconstruction era|holding political office]]. Louisiana saw the United States' first and second black governors with [[Oscar Dunn]] and [[P. B. S. Pinchback|P.B.S. Pinchback]], with 125 black members of the state legislature being elected during this time, while [[Charles E. Nash]] was elected to represent the state's [[Louisiana's 6th congressional district|6th Congressional District]] in the U.S. House of Representatives. Eventually former Confederates came to dominate the state legislature after the end of [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] and federal occupation in the late 1870s, and black codes were implemented to regulate [[freedmen]] and increasingly restricted the right to vote. They refused to extend voting rights to African Americans who had been free before the war and had sometimes obtained education and property (as in New Orleans).

Following the [[Memphis riots of 1866]] and the [[New Orleans riot]] the same year, the Fourteenth Amendment was passed that provided suffrage and full citizenship for freedmen. Congress passed the [[Reconstruction Acts|Reconstruction Act]], establishing military districts for those states where conditions were considered the worst, including Louisiana. It was grouped with [[Texas]] in what was administered as the [[Fifth Military District]].<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Army. 5th Military District.|url=http://archives.nolalibrary.org/~nopl/mss/orders1867and1868.htm|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-20|website=NOLA Library|archive-date=June 24, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624210547/http://archives.nolalibrary.org/~nopl/mss/orders1867and1868.htm}}</ref>

African Americans began to live as citizens with some measure of equality before the law. Both freedmen and people of color who had been free before the war began to make more advances in education, family stability and jobs. At the same time, there was tremendous social volatility in the aftermath of war, with many whites actively resisting defeat and the free labor market. White [[insurgents]] mobilized to enforce [[white supremacy]], first in [[Ku Klux Klan]] chapters.

By 1877, when federal forces were withdrawn, white Democrats in Louisiana and other states had regained control of state legislatures, often by paramilitary groups such as the [[White League]], which suppressed black voting through intimidation and violence. Following Mississippi's example in 1890, in 1898, the white Democratic, planter-dominated legislature passed a new constitution that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] people of color by raising barriers to voter registration, such as [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], residency requirements and [[literacy tests]]. The effect was immediate and long lasting. In 1896, there were 130,334 black voters on the rolls and about the same number of white voters, in proportion to the state population, which was evenly divided.<ref>{{Cite journal|ssrn=224731 |title=Richard H.

The state population in 1900 was 47% African American: a total of 652,013 citizens. Many in New Orleans were descendants of Creoles of color, the sizeable population of free people of color before the Civil War.<ref>[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1900 US Census, University of Virginia], accessed March 15, 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823030234/http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php |date=August 23, 2007 }}</ref> By 1900, two years after the new constitution, only 5,320 black voters were registered in the state. Because of disfranchisement, by 1910 there were only 730 black voters (less than 0.5 percent of eligible African-American men), despite advances in education and literacy among blacks and people of color.<ref>[https://ssrn.com/abstract=224731 Richard H.

White Democrats had established one-party Democratic rule, which they maintained in the state for decades deep into the 20th century until after congressional passage of the 1965 [[Voting Rights Act]] provided federal oversight and enforcement of the constitutional right to vote.

In the early decades of the 20th century, thousands of African Americans left Louisiana in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] north to industrial cities for jobs and education, and to escape Jim Crow society and [[lynchings]]. The [[boll weevil]] infestation and agricultural problems cost many sharecroppers and farmers their jobs. The mechanization of agriculture also reduced the need for laborers. Beginning in the 1940s, blacks went west to California for jobs in its expanding defense industries.<ref>[http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/landing.cfm?migration=9 "African American Migration Experience: The Great Migration", ''In Motion'', New York Public Library, Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104202248/http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/landing.cfm?migration=9 |date=November 4, 2013 }}, accessed April 24, 2008</ref>

During some of the [[Great Depression]], Louisiana was led by Governor [[Huey Long]]. He was elected to office on populist appeal. His public works projects provided thousands of jobs to people in need, and he supported education and increased suffrage for poor whites, but Long was criticized for his allegedly demagogic and autocratic style. He extended patronage control through every branch of Louisiana's state government. Especially controversial were his plans for wealth redistribution in the state. Long's rule ended abruptly when he was [[Assassination of Huey Long|assassinated]] in the state capitol in 1935.<ref>{{cite news |last=Glass|first=Andrew|date=September 8, 2017|title=Huey Long assassinated, Sept. 8, 1935|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/08/huey-long-assassinated-sept-8-1935-242325|work=Politico|access-date=June 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200513093913/https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/08/huey-long-assassinated-sept-8-1935-242325|archive-date=May 13, 2020}}</ref>

=== Mid–20th century to present ===
Mobilization for [[World War II]] created jobs in the state. But thousands of other workers, black and white alike, migrated to California for better jobs in its burgeoning defense industry. Many African Americans left the state in the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]], from the 1940s through the 1960s to escape social oppression and seek better jobs. The mechanization of agriculture in the 1930s had sharply cut the need for laborers. They sought skilled jobs in the defense industry in California, better education for their children, and living in communities where they could vote.<ref>[http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/landing.cfm?migration=9 "African American Migration Experience: The Second Great Migration", ''In Motion'', New York Public Library, Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104202248/http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/landing.cfm?migration=9 |date=November 4, 2013 }}, accessed April 24, 2008</ref>

In the 1950s the state created new requirements for a citizenship test for voter registration. Despite opposition by the [[Dixiecrats|States' Rights Party]] (Dixiecrats), downstate black voters had begun to increase their rate of registration, which also reflected the growth of their middle classes. In 1960 the state established the Louisiana State Sovereignty Commission, to investigate civil rights activists and maintain segregation.<ref>Adam Fairclough, ''Race & Democracy: The Civil Rights Struggle in Louisiana, 1915–1972'', University of Georgia Press, 1999</ref>

Despite this, gradually black voter registration and turnout increased to 20% and more, and it was 32% by 1964, when the first national civil rights legislation of the era was passed.<ref>[http://www.naacpldf.org/content/pdf/reauthorization/Louisiana_VRA_Report.pdf Debo P.

Violent attacks on civil rights activists in two mill towns were catalysts to the founding of the first two chapters of the [[Deacons for Defense and Justice]] in late 1964 and early 1965, in [[Jonesboro, Louisiana|Jonesboro]] and [[Bogalusa, Louisiana|Bogalusa]], respectively. Made up of veterans of World War II and the [[Korean War]], they were armed self-defense groups established to protect activists and their families. Continued violent white resistance in Bogalusa to blacks trying to use public facilities in 1965, following passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], caused the federal government to order local police to protect the activists.<ref name="nyt">{{cite news |title=Robert Hicks, Leader in Armed Rights Group, Dies at 81 |author=Douglas Martin |date=April 24, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/us/25hicks.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=September 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018103407/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/us/25hicks.html |archive-date=October 18, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Other chapters were formed in Mississippi and Alabama.

Louisiana is bordered to the west by [[Texas]]; to the north by [[Arkansas]]; to the east by [[Mississippi]]; and to the south by the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The state may properly be divided into two parts, the uplands of the north (the region of [[North Louisiana]]), and the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain|alluvial]] along the coast (the [[Central Louisiana]], [[Acadiana]], [[Florida Parishes]], and [[New Orleans metropolitan area|Greater New Orleans]] regions). The alluvial region includes low swamp lands, coastal marshlands and beaches, and [[barrier islands]] that cover about {{convert|12350|sqmi|km2}}. This area lies principally along the Gulf of Mexico and the [[Mississippi River]], which traverses the state from north to south for a distance of about {{convert|600|mi|-1|abbr=on}} and empties into the Gulf of Mexico; also in the state are the [[Red River of the South|Red River]]; the [[Ouachita River]] and its branches; and other minor streams (some of which are called [[bayous]]).

The breadth of the alluvial region along the Mississippi is {{convert|10|–|60|mi|km}}, and along the other rivers, the alluvial region averages about {{convert|10|mi|km}} across. The Mississippi River flows along a ridge formed by its natural deposits (known as a [[levee]]), from which the lands decline toward a river beyond at an average fall of six feet per mile (3{{spaces}}m/km). The alluvial lands along other streams present similar features.

The higher and contiguous hill lands of the north and northwestern part of the state have an area of more than {{convert|25000|sqmi|km2}}. They consist of prairie and woodlands. The elevations above sea level range from 10 feet (3{{spaces}}m) at the coast and swamp lands to 50–60 feet (15–18{{spaces}}m) at the prairie and alluvial lands. In the uplands and hills, the elevations rise to [[Driskill Mountain]], the highest point in the state only 535 feet (163{{spaces}}m) above sea level. From 1932 to 2010 the state lost 1,800 square miles due to rises in sea level and [[erosion]]. The [[Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority]] (CPRA) spends around $1{{spaces}}billion per year to help shore up and protect Louisiana [[shore]]line and land in both federal and state funding.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21727099-has-lessons-americas-climate-change-policy-louisiana-fights-sea-and-loses|title=Louisiana fights the sea, and loses|newspaper=The Economist|date=August 26, 2017|access-date=August 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828163535/https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21727099-has-lessons-americas-climate-change-policy-louisiana-fights-sea-and-loses|archive-date=August 28, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Rebuild or retreat?

Besides the waterways named, there are the [[Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)|Sabine]], forming the western boundary; and the [[Pearl River (Mississippi-Louisiana)|Pearl]], the eastern boundary; the [[Calcasieu River|Calcasieu]], the [[Mermentau River|Mermentau]], the [[Vermilion River (Louisiana)|Vermilion]], [[Bayou Teche]], the [[Atchafalaya River|Atchafalaya]], the [[Boeuf River|Boeuf]], [[Bayou Lafourche]], the Courtableau River, Bayou D'Arbonne, the Macon River, the [[Tensas River|Tensas]], [[Amite River]], the [[Tchefuncte River|Tchefuncte]], the [[Tickfaw River|Tickfaw]], the [[Natalbany River]], and a number of other smaller streams, constituting a natural system of navigable waterways, aggregating over {{convert|4000|mi|km}} long.

The state also has political jurisdiction over the approximately {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}}-wide portion of [[subsea]] land of the [[Outer continental shelf|inner continental shelf]] in the Gulf of Mexico. Through a peculiarity of the [[political geography]] of the United States, this is substantially less than the {{convert|9|mi|km|adj=on}}-wide jurisdiction of nearby states Texas and Florida, which, like Louisiana, have extensive Gulf coastlines.<ref name="Tulanian2008">{{Cite journal

The southern coast of Louisiana in the United States is among the fastest-disappearing areas in the world. This has largely resulted from human mismanagement of the coast (see [[Wetlands of Louisiana]]). At one time, the land was added to when spring floods from the Mississippi River added sediment and stimulated marsh growth; the land is now shrinking. There are multiple causes.<ref name="Keddy 2010">{{cite book|last=Keddy|first=Paul|title=Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-51940-3|page=497}}</ref><ref>Ricardo A.

Artificial levees block spring flood water that would bring fresh water and sediment to marshes. Swamps have been extensively logged, leaving canals and ditches that allow salt water to move inland. Canals dug for the oil and gas industry also allow storms to move sea water inland, where it damages swamps and marshes. Rising sea waters have exacerbated the problem. Some researchers estimate that the state is losing a landmass equivalent to 30 football fields every day. There are many proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, including restoring natural floods from the Mississippi. Without such restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear.<ref>Boesch, D. F., Josselyn, M. N., Mehta, A. J., Morris, J. T., Nuttle, W. K., Simenstad, C. A., and Swift, D. P. J. (1994).

===Geology===
{{Main|Mississippi River Delta}}
The oldest rocks in Louisiana are exposed in the north, in areas such as the [[Kisatchie National Forest]]. The oldest rocks date back to the early [[Cenozoic Era]], some 60 million years ago.<ref>{{cite book |last=Spearing |first=D. |year=1995 |title=Roadside Geology of Louisiana |publisher=Mountain Press Publishing Company |location=[[Missoula, Montana]] |pages=5–19 }}</ref> The youngest parts of the state were formed during the last 12,000 years as successive deltas of the Mississippi River: the [[Maringouin, Louisiana|Maringouin]], [[Bayou Teche|Teche]], [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana|St. Bernard]], [[Bayou Lafourche|Lafourche]], the modern Mississippi, and now the [[Atchafalaya River|Atchafalaya]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coleman |first1=J.

Between the tertiary rocks of the north, and the relatively new sediments along the coast, is a vast belt known as the [[Pleistocene]] Terraces. Their age and distribution can be largely related to the rise and fall of sea levels during past ice ages. The northern terraces have had sufficient time for rivers to cut deep channels, while the newer terraces tend to be much flatter.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Holland |first=W.C. |date=1944 |title=Physiographic divisions of the Quaternary lowlands of Louisiana |journal=Proceedings of the Louisiana Academy of Sciences |volume=8 |pages=10–24 }}</ref>

[[Salt dome]]s are also found in Louisiana. Their origin can be traced back to the early [[Gulf of Mexico]] when the shallow ocean had high rates of evaporation. There are several hundred salt domes in the state; one of the most familiar is [[Avery Island, Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kniffen |first1=F. B. |author2=S. B.

Louisiana has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''), with long, hot, humid summers and short, mild winters. The subtropical characteristics of the state are due to its low latitude, low lying topography, and the influence of the Gulf of Mexico, which at its farthest point is no more than {{convert|200|mi|-1|abbr=on}} away.

Rain is frequent throughout the year, although from April to September is slightly wetter than the rest of the year, which is the state's [[wet season]]. There is a dip in precipitation in October. In summer, thunderstorms build during the heat of the day and bring intense but brief, tropical downpours. In winter, rainfall is more frontal and less intense.

Summers in southern Louisiana have high temperatures from June through September averaging {{cvt|90|F}} or more, and overnight lows averaging above {{cvt|70|F}}. At times, temperatures in the 90s{{nbsp}}°F{{nbsp}}({{convert|90|-|99|F|C|disp=out}}), combined with [[dew points]] in the upper 70s{{nbsp}}°F{{nbsp}}({{convert|75|-|79|F|C|disp=out}}), create sensible temperatures over {{convert|120|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. The humid, thick, jungle-like heat in southern Louisiana is a famous subject of countless stories and movies.

Temperatures are generally warm in the winter in the southern part of the state, with highs around New Orleans, Baton Rouge, the rest of southern Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico averaging {{convert|66|°F}}. The northern part of the state is mildly cool in the winter, with highs averaging {{convert|59|°F}}. The overnight lows in the winter average well above freezing throughout the state, with {{convert|46|°F}} the average near the Gulf and an average low of {{convert|37|°F}} in the winter in the northern part of the state.

On occasion, cold fronts from low-pressure centers to the north, reach Louisiana in winter. Low temperatures near {{convert|20|°F}} occur on occasion in the northern part of the state but rarely do so in the southern part of the state. [[Snow in Louisiana|Snow]] is rare near the Gulf of Mexico, although residents in the northern parts of the state might receive a dusting of snow a few times each decade.<ref>{{cite web|date=December 31, 2012|title=When It Snowed in New Orleans|url=https://www.myneworleans.com/when-it-snowed-in-new-orleans/|access-date=2021-11-04|website=My New Orleans|language=en-US|archive-date=November 4, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211104201511/https://www.myneworleans.com/when-it-snowed-in-new-orleans/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=110,000 customers left without power in Texas and Louisiana as major snowstorm moves across the South|url=https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/11/weather/southern-snowstorm-outages-monday/index.html|url-status=live|access-date=2021-11-04|website=CNN|archive-date=November 4, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211104201509/https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/11/weather/southern-snowstorm-outages-monday/index.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Kennell|first=Tiana|title=Weather update: Residents react, prepare for a week of snow in Shreveport, Bossier City|url=https://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/weather/2021/02/15/weather-update-snow-day-forecast-february-shreveport-residents/6751883002/|access-date=2021-11-04|website=The Times|language=en-US|archive-date=November 4, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211104201511/https://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/weather/2021/02/15/weather-update-snow-day-forecast-february-shreveport-residents/6751883002/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=February 16, 2021|title=North Louisiana sees second snow storm of 2021; How residents are enjoying the weather|url=https://www.myarklamiss.com/community/north-louisiana-sees-second-snow-storm-of-2021-how-residents-are-enjoying-the-weather/|access-date=2021-11-04|website=KTVE - myarklamiss.com|language=en-US|archive-date=November 4, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211104201511/https://www.myarklamiss.com/community/north-louisiana-sees-second-snow-storm-of-2021-how-residents-are-enjoying-the-weather/|url-status=live}}</ref> Louisiana's highest recorded temperature is {{convert|114|F|C}} in [[Plain Dealing, Louisiana|Plain Dealing]] on August 10, 1936, while the coldest recorded temperature is {{convert|-16|F|C}} at [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]] on February 13, 1899.

Louisiana is often affected by [[tropical cyclone]]s and is very vulnerable to strikes by major [[Atlantic hurricane|hurricanes]], particularly the [[Upland and lowland|lowlands]] around and in the New Orleans area. The unique geography of the region, with the many bayous, marshes and inlets, can result in water damage across a wide area from major hurricanes. The area is also prone to frequent thunderstorms, especially in the summer.<ref name="Annual average number of tornadoes">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |title=NOAA National Climatic Data Center |access-date=April 23, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |archive-date=October 16, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The entire state averages over 60 days of thunderstorms a year, more than any other state except Florida. Louisiana averages 27 [[tornado]]es annually. The entire state is vulnerable to a tornado strike, with the extreme southern portion of the state slightly less so than the rest of the state. Tornadoes are more common from January to March in the southern part of the state, and from February through March in the northern part of the state.<ref name="Annual average number of tornadoes"/> Louisiana is partially within the area of tornado activity called [[Dixie Alley]], and the state has tornadoes which tend to be unpredictable but localized.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mathewson |first=Kent |title=The Louisiana Field Guide: Understanding Life in the Pelican State |date=2014 |publisher=[[Louisiana State University Press]] |isbn=978-0-8071-5776-3 |editor-last=Orgera |editor-first=Ryan |chapter=The Geography of Louisiana |editor-last2=Parent |editor-first2=Wayne}}</ref>

''Louisiana Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy''. Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, Baton Rouge, LA</ref> In addition to [[National Park Service]] areas and a [[United States National Forest]], Louisiana operates a system of [[List of Louisiana state parks|state parks]], [[List of Louisiana state historic sites|state historic sites]], one [[Louisiana State Arboretum|state preservation area]], one [[Alexander State Forest|state forest]], and many [[Wildlife Management Area]]s.

One of Louisiana's largest government-owned areas is [[Kisatchie National Forest]]. It is some 600,000 acres in area, more than half of which is [[flatwoods]] vegetation, which supports many rare plant and animal species.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hyatt|first=Phil|date=November 20, 2020|title=Story of Kisatchie Botany|url=https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/kisatchie/landmanagement/resourcemanagement/?cid=fsbdev3_024695|access-date=November 20, 2020|archive-date=February 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210220154051/https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/kisatchie/landmanagement/resourcemanagement/?cid=fsbdev3_024695|url-status=live}}</ref> These include the [[Louisiana pinesnake]] and [[red-cockaded woodpecker]]. The system of government-owned [[Cypress dome|cypress swamps]] around [[Lake Pontchartrain]] is another large area, with southern [[wetland]] species including egrets, alligators, and sturgeon. At least 12 core areas would be needed to build a "protected areas system" for the state; these would range from southwestern prairies, to the Pearl River Floodplain in the east, to the Mississippi River alluvial swamps in the north. Additionally, the state operates a system of 22 state parks, 17 state historic sites and one state preservation area; in these lands, Louisiana maintains a [[Fauna of Louisiana|diversity of fauna]] and flora.

Because of French and Spanish heritage, and their descendants the Creoles, and later Irish, Italian, Portuguese and German immigrants, southern Louisiana and Greater New Orleans are predominantly Catholic in contrast; according to the 2020 Public Religion Research Institute study, 22% of the adult population were Catholic.<ref name=":7" /> Since Creoles were the first settlers, planters and leaders of the territory, they have traditionally been well represented in politics; for instance, most of the early governors were Creole Catholics, instead of Protestants.<ref name=":8">{{CathEncy|wstitle=Louisiana}}</ref> As Catholics continue to constitute a significant fraction of Louisiana's population, they have continued to be influential in state politics.

Among states in the [[Deep South]] (discounting [[Florida Panhandle|Florida's Panhandle]] and much of Texas) the historic role of Catholicism in Louisiana is unparalleled and unique. Among the states of the Union, Louisiana's unique use of the term ''parish'' (French {{lang|fr|la parouche}} or "{{lang|fr|la paroisse}}") for ''county'' is rooted in the pre-statehood role of Catholic church parishes in the administration of government.}} The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Baton Rouge|Diocese of Baton Rouge]], and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lafayette in Louisiana|Diocese of Lafayette in Louisiana]] are the largest Catholic jurisdictions in the state, located within the Greater New Orleans, Greater Baton Rouge, and Lafayette metropolitan statistical areas.[[File:St. Louis Cathedral (New Orleans).jpg|thumb|[[St. Louis Cathedral (New Orleans)|Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis]] in New Orleans]]

Louisiana was among the southern states with a significant Jewish population before the 20th century; Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia also had influential Jewish populations in some of their major cities from the 18th and 19th centuries. The earliest Jewish colonists were [[Sephardic Jews]] who immigrated to the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. Later in the 19th century, German Jews began to immigrate, followed by those from eastern Europe and the Russian Empire in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Jewish communities have been established in the state's larger cities, notably New Orleans and Baton Rouge.<ref>Isaacs, Ronald H.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Louisiana|Literature of Louisiana|Music of Louisiana}}
Louisiana is home to many cultures; especially notable are the distinct cultures of the [[Louisiana Creoles]] and [[Cajuns]], descendants of French and Spanish settlers in colonial Louisiana.

===African culture===
The French colony of ''La Louisiane'' struggled for decades to survive. Conditions were harsh, the climate and soil were unsuitable for certain crops the colonists knew, and they suffered from regional tropical diseases. Both colonists and the slaves they imported had high mortality rates. The settlers kept importing slaves, which resulted in a high proportion of native Africans from West Africa, who continued to practice their culture in new surroundings. As described by historian [[Gwendolyn Midlo Hall]], they developed a marked Afro-Creole culture in the colonial era.<ref>Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, ''Africans in Colonial Louisiana: The Development of Afro-Creole Culture in the Eighteenth Century'' (1992)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/laslave/|title=Afro-Louisiana History and Genealogy|website=Ibiblio.org|access-date=October 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190430233835/http://www.ibiblio.org/laslave/|archive-date=April 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

At the turn of the 18th century and in the early 1800s, New Orleans received a major influx of White and mixed-race refugees fleeing the violence of the [[Haitian Revolution]], many of whom brought their slaves with them.<ref>{{cite web|title=AAME|url=http://www.inmotionaame.org/texts/viewer.cfm;jsessionid=f8301863741603865579076?id=5_000T&bhcp=1|access-date=October 28, 2020|website=Inmotionaame.org|archive-date=October 31, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031172524/http://www.inmotionaame.org/texts/viewer.cfm;jsessionid=f8301863741603865579076?id=5_000T&bhcp=1|url-status=dead}}</ref> This added another infusion of African culture to the city, as more slaves in [[Saint-Domingue]] were from Africa than in the United States. They strongly influenced the African-American culture of the city in terms of dance, music and religious practices.

===Creole culture===
[[File:CreoleFood.jpg|thumb|Typical dishes of [[Louisiana Creole cuisine]]]]
[[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] culture is an amalgamation of French, African, Spanish (and other European), and Native American cultures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laheritage.org/CreoleHeritage/index.html |title=French Creole Heritage |publisher=Laheritage.org |access-date=April 23, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830084559/http://www.laheritage.org/CreoleHeritage/index.html |archive-date=August 30, 2014 }}</ref> Creole comes from the Portuguese word ''crioulo''; originally it referred to a colonist of European (specifically French) descent who was born in the New World, in comparison to immigrants from France.<ref>Delehanty, Randolph. ''New Orleans: Elegance and Decadence, Chronicle Books'', 1995, pg. 14</ref> The oldest Louisiana manuscript to use the word "Creole", from 1782, applied it to a slave born in the French colony.<ref>Kein, Sybil. ''Creole: The History and Legacy of Louisiana's Free People of Color'', Louisiana State University Press, 2009, p. 73.</ref> But originally it referred more generally to the French colonists born in Louisiana.

Over time, there developed in the French colony a relatively large group of [[Creoles of Color]] (''gens de couleur libres''), who were primarily descended from African slave women and French men (later other Europeans became part of the mix, as well as some Native Americans). Often the French would free their concubines and [[mixed-race]] children, and pass on social capital to them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Creoles|url=https://64parishes.org/entry/creoles|access-date=2022-01-24|website=64 Parishes|language=en|quote=By the 1720s, free mixed-race Louisianans made up such a substantial part of the population that the Code Noir (laws governing race relations in Louisiana) spelled out the group’s special place in colonial society. These Creoles of color, as they were known (gens de couleur libres in French, "free persons of color"), occupied a middle ground between whites and enslaved blacks. They commonly owned property, including slaves, and received formal educations, sometimes in Europe.|archive-date=July 1, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210701153301/https://64parishes.org/entry/creoles|url-status=live}}</ref> They might educate sons in France, for instance, and help them enter the French Army. They also settled capital or property on their mistresses and children. The free people of color gained more rights in the colony and sometimes education; they generally spoke French and were Roman Catholic. Many became artisans and property owners. Over time, the term "Creole" became associated with this class of Creoles of color, many of whom achieved freedom long before the American Civil War.

Wealthy French Creoles generally maintained town houses in [[New Orleans]] as well as houses on their large sugar plantations outside town along the Mississippi River. New Orleans had the largest population of free people of color in the region; they could find work there and created their own culture, marrying among themselves for decades.

===Acadian culture===
The ancestors of [[Cajun]]s immigrated mostly from west central France to New France, where they settled in the Atlantic provinces of [[New Brunswick]], Nova Scotia and [[Prince Edward Island]], known originally as the French colony of [[Acadia]]. After the British defeated France in the [[French and Indian War]] ([[Seven Years' War]]) in 1763, France ceded its territory east of the Mississippi River to Britain. After the Acadians refused to swear an oath of loyalty to the British Crown, they were [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expelled from Acadia]], and made their way to places such as France, Britain, and New England.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cajuns|url=https://64parishes.org/entry/cajuns|access-date=2022-01-24|website=64 Parishes|language=en|archive-date=March 19, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220319080920/https://64parishes.org/entry/cajuns|url-status=live}}</ref>

Other Acadians covertly remained in [[British America|British North America]] or moved to [[New Spain]]. Many Acadians settled in southern Louisiana in the region around [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] and the LaFourche Bayou country. They developed a distinct rural culture there, different from the French Creole colonists of New Orleans. Intermarrying with others in the area, they developed what was called Cajun music, cuisine and culture.

===Isleño culture===

A third distinct culture in Louisiana is that of the Isleños. Its members are descendants of colonists from the [[Canary Islands]] who settled in [[Spanish Louisiana]] between 1778 and 1783 and intermarried with other communities such as [[French people|Frenchmen]], [[Acadians]], [[Louisiana Creole people|Creoles]], [[Spaniards]], and other groups, mainly through the 19th and early 20th centuries.

In Louisiana, the Isleños originally settled in four communities which included Galveztown, Valenzuela, Barataria, and San Bernardo. The large migration of [[Acadian]] refugees to [[Bayou Lafourche]] led to the rapid gallicization of the Valenzuela community while the community of San Bernardo ([[Saint Bernard Parish, Louisiana|Saint Bernard]]) was able to preserve much of its unique culture and language into the 21st century. The transmission of Spanish and other customs has completely halted in St. Bernard with those having competency in Spanish being octogenarians.<ref name=":02">{{cite book|title=The Language of the Isleños: Vestigial Spanish in Louisiana|last1=Lipski|first1=John|date=July 1, 1990|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|isbn=0807115347|pages=i, 4}}</ref>

Through the centuries, the various Isleño communities of Louisiana have kept alive different elements of their Canary Islander heritage while also adopting and building upon the customs and traditions of the communities that surround them. Today two heritage associates exist for the communities: Los Isleños Heritage and Cultural Society of St. Bernard as well as the Canary Islanders Heritage Society of Louisiana. The [[Isleños Fiesta|Fiesta de los Isleños]] is celebrated annually in St. Bernard Parish which features heritage performances from local groups and the Canary Islands.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fink|first=Shawn|title=Photos: The Los Isleños Fiesta celebrates Canary Island immigrants, cultural heritage of St. Bernard|url=https://www.nola.com/multimedia/photos/collection_97e45d44-622f-11ea-b007-ef634a18db88.html|access-date=October 28, 2020|website=NOLA.com|date=March 9, 2020 |archive-date=October 31, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031061003/https://www.nola.com/multimedia/photos/collection_97e45d44-622f-11ea-b007-ef634a18db88.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1849, the state moved the capital from New Orleans to [[Baton Rouge]]. [[Donaldsonville, Louisiana|Donaldsonville]], [[Opelousas, Louisiana|Opelousas]], and [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] have briefly served as the seat of Louisiana state government. The [[Louisiana State Capitol]] and the [[Louisiana Governor's Mansion]] are both located in Baton Rouge. The [[Louisiana Supreme Court]], however, did not move to Baton Rouge but remains headquartered in New Orleans.

The current [[United States Senate|United States senators]] are Republicans [[John Neely Kennedy]] and [[Bill Cassidy]]. Louisiana has six [[congressional district]]s and is represented in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] by five Republicans and one Democrat.

===Administrative divisions===
Louisiana is divided into 64 [[Parish (administrative division)|parishes]] (the equivalent of [[County (United States)|counties]] in most other states).<ref name="nativeamericans">{{Handbook of Texas|id=bzi04|name=Native Americans}}</ref>
*[[List of parishes in Louisiana]]
*[[Louisiana census statistical areas]]

Most parishes have an elected government known as the Police Jury,<ref>{{cite web|title=What is the Police Jury? – Acadia Parish Police Jury|url=http://www.appj.org/what-is-the-police-jury/|access-date=2021-08-10|language=en-US|archive-date=August 10, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210810175757/http://www.appj.org/what-is-the-police-jury/|url-status=live}}</ref> dating from the colonial days. It is the legislative and executive government of the parish, and is elected by the voters. Its members are called Jurors, and together they elect a president as their chairman.

A more limited number of parishes operate under [[home rule]] charters, electing various forms of government. This include mayor–council, council–manager (in which the council hires a professional operating manager for the parish), and others.

===Civil law===
The Louisiana political and legal structure has maintained several elements from the times of French and Spanish governance. One is the use of the term "[[parish (Louisiana)|parish]]" (from the French: {{Lang|fr|paroisse}}) in place of "[[County (United States)|county]]" for administrative subdivision.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why parishes? The story behind Louisiana's unique map|url=https://www.nola.com/300/article_114112d3-89f7-5044-801b-b4a9fe981938.html|url-status=live|access-date=2021-08-10|website=NOLA.com|date=September 8, 2017 |language=en|archive-date=August 10, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210810175757/https://www.nola.com/300/article_114112d3-89f7-5044-801b-b4a9fe981938.html}}</ref> Another is the legal system of [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] based on French, German, and Spanish [[legal code]]s and ultimately [[Roman law]], as opposed to English [[common law]].

Louisiana's civil law system is what the majority of [[sovereign state]]s in the world use, especially in Europe and its former colonies, excluding those that derive their legal systems from the [[British Empire]]. However, it is incorrect to equate the [[Louisiana Civil Code]] with the [[Napoleonic Code]]. Although the Napoleonic Code and Louisiana law draw from common legal roots, the Napoleonic Code was never in force in Louisiana, as it was enacted in 1804, after the United States had [[Louisiana Purchase|purchased]] and annexed Louisiana in 1803.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.louisiana.gov/about-louisiana/|title=About Louisiana|website=Louisiana.gov|access-date=2021-11-10|archive-date=November 11, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211111060352/https://www.louisiana.gov/about-louisiana/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Louisiana Civil Code is the controlling authority on civil matters in the state and has been continuously revised and updated since its enactment in 1808. While some of the differences between the legal systems have been bridged due to the strong influence of common law tradition,<ref name="kinsellalaw">{{cite web|url=http://www.kinsellalaw.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/dictionary.pdf |title=A Civil Law to Common Law Dictionary |access-date=December 7, 2010 |last=Kinsella |first=Norman |year=1997 |website=KinsellaLaw.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225105448/http://www.kinsellalaw.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/dictionary.pdf |archive-date=December 25, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the civil law tradition is still deeply rooted in most aspects of Louisiana private law.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}} Thus property, contractual, business entities structure, much of civil procedure, and family law, as well as some aspects of criminal law, are based mostly on traditional Roman legal thinking.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

===Marriage===
In 1997, Louisiana became the first state to offer the option of a traditional marriage or a [[covenant marriage]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marriage.about.com/cs/covenantmarriage/a/covenant.htm |title=Covenant Marriage—Pros and Cons |publisher=Marriage.about.com |date=January 1, 2012 |access-date=February 18, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307225008/http://marriage.about.com/cs/covenantmarriage/a/covenant.htm |archive-date=March 7, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In a covenant marriage, the couple waives their right to a "no-fault" divorce after six months of separation, which is available in a traditional marriage. To divorce under a covenant marriage, a couple must demonstrate cause.

From 1898 to 1965, a period when Louisiana had effectively [[Disfranchisement after the Civil War|disfranchised]] most African Americans and many poor whites by provisions of a new constitution,<ref name="GWUweb">{{cite web|title=Reading the Fine Print: The Grandfather Clause in Louisiana|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5352/|website=History Matters: The U.S. Survey Course on the Web|publisher=George Washington University|access-date=October 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031073422/http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5352|archive-date=October 31, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> this was essentially a one-party state dominated by white Democrats. Elites had control in the early 20th century, before populist [[Huey Long]] came to power as governor.<ref name="Cashman">{{cite book|last=Cashman|first=Sean Dennis|title=African-Americans and the Quest for Civil Rights, 1900–1990|year=1991|publisher=New York University Press|isbn=9780814714416|page=[https://archive.org/details/africanamericans00cash/page/8 8]|url=https://archive.org/details/africanamericans00cash|url-access=registration|access-date=July 1, 2015}}</ref> In multiple acts of resistance, blacks left behind the segregation, violence and oppression of the state and moved out to seek better opportunities in northern and western industrial cities during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migrations]] of 1910–1970, markedly reducing their proportion of population in Louisiana. The franchise for whites was expanded somewhat during these decades, but blacks remained essentially disfranchised until after the [[civil rights movement]] of the mid-20th century, gaining enforcement of their constitutional rights through passage by Congress of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].

Since the 1960s, when civil rights legislation was passed under President [[Lyndon Johnson]] to protect voting and civil rights, most African Americans in the state have affiliated with the Democratic Party. In the same years, many white social conservatives have moved to support Republican Party candidates in national, gubernatorial and statewide elections. In 2004, [[David Vitter]] was the first Republican in Louisiana to be popularly elected as a U.S. senator.<ref>{{cite web|title=David Vitter|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CDOC-114sdoc24/html/CDOC-114sdoc24.htm|url-status=live|access-date=2021-08-10|website=www.govinfo.gov|archive-date=August 10, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210810175755/https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CDOC-114sdoc24/html/CDOC-114sdoc24.htm}}</ref> The previous Republican senator, [[John S. Harris]], who took office in 1868 during Reconstruction, was chosen by the state legislature under the rules of the 19th century.

Louisiana is unique among U.S. states in using a system for its state and local elections similar to that of modern France. All candidates, regardless of party affiliation, run in a [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] (or "jungle primary") on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Review Types of Elections|url=https://www.sos.la.gov/ElectionsAndVoting/GetElectionInformation/ReviewTypesOfElections/Pages/default.aspx|access-date=2021-08-10|website=www.sos.la.gov|archive-date=August 19, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210819025824/https://www.sos.la.gov/ElectionsAndVoting/GetElectionInformation/ReviewTypesOfElections/Pages/default.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref> If no candidate has more than 50% of the vote, the two candidates with the highest vote totals compete in a runoff election approximately one month later. This run-off method does not take into account party identification; therefore, it is not uncommon for a Democrat to be in a runoff with a fellow Democrat or a Republican to be in a runoff with a fellow Republican.

Congressional races have also been held under the jungle primary system. All other states (except [[Washington Initiative 872 (2004)|Washington]], [[California Proposition 14 (2010)|California]], and [[Maine]]) use single-party primaries followed by a general election between party candidates, each conducted by either a [[plurality voting system]] or [[Two-round system|runoff voting]], to elect senators, representatives, and statewide officials. Between 2008 and 2010, federal [[United States Congress|congressional]] elections were run under a closed primary system—limited to registered party members. However, on the passage of House Bill 292, Louisiana again adopted a nonpartisan blanket primary for its federal congressional elections.

Louisiana has six seats in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], five of which are currently held by Republicans and one by a Democrat. Though the state historically flips between Republican and Democratic governors, Louisiana is not classified as a [[swing state]] in presidential elections, as it has consistently voted for the Republican candidate by solid margins since backing Democrat [[1996 United States presidential election in Louisiana|Bill Clinton in 1996]]. The state's two U.S. senators are [[Bill Cassidy]] (R) and [[John Neely Kennedy]] (R).

===Law enforcement===
{{See also|List of law enforcement agencies in Louisiana}}
Louisiana's statewide police force is the [[Louisiana State Police]].

Each year, they patrol over {{convert|12|e6mi|e6km|abbr=off}} of roadway and arrest about 10,000 impaired drivers. The State Police are primarily a traffic enforcement agency, with other sections that delve into trucking safety, narcotics enforcement, and gaming oversight.

The elected sheriff in each parish is its chief law enforcement officer. They are the keepers of the local parish prisons, which house felony and misdemeanor prisoners. They are the primary criminal patrol and first responder agency in all matters criminal and civil. They are also the official tax collectors in each parish. The sheriffs are responsible for general law enforcement in their respective parishes, with the exception of Orleans Parish where this falls to the New Orleans Police Department. Before 2010, Orleans Parish was the only parish to have two sheriff's offices, with a different elected sheriff overseeing civil and criminal matters. In 2006, a bill was passed which eventually consolidated the two sheriff's departments into one parish sheriff responsible for both.<ref>{{cite web|title=Louisiana Laws – Louisiana State Legislature|url=http://legis.la.gov/Legis/LawPrint.aspx?d=763316|access-date=December 23, 2020|website=legis.la.gov|archive-date=March 10, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210310103305/http://legis.la.gov/Legis/LawPrint.aspx?d=763316|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2015, Louisiana had a higher murder rate (10.3 per 100,000) than any other state in the country for the 27th straight year. Louisiana is the only state with an annual average murder rate (13.6 per 100,000) at least twice as high as the U.S. annual average (6.6 per 100,000) during that period, according to Bureau of Justice Statistics from FBI Uniform Crime Reports. In a different kind of criminal activity, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reports that Louisiana is the most corrupt state in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|last=Witt|first=Howard|title=Most corrupt state: Louisiana ranked higher than Illinois|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-corruption-louisiana_wittmar27,0,2957672.story|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=March 27, 2009|access-date=June 2, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125255/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-corruption-louisiana_wittmar27,0,2957672.story|archive-date=June 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>
