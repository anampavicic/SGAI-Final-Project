== Archaeology ==
According to the [[Journal of Archaeological Science]], in July 2020, scientists from [[South Ural State University]] studied two [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze Age]] horses with the aid of [[radiocarbon dating]] from Kurgan 5 of the Novoilinovsky 2 cemetery in the [[Lisakovsk]] city. Researcher Igor Chechushkov, indicated that the Andronovites had an ability on horse riding several centuries earlier than many researchers had previously expected. Among the horses investigated, the [[stallion]] was nearly 20 years old and the [[mare]] was 18 years old. According to scientists, animals were buried with the person they accompanied throughout their lives, and they were used not only for food, but also for harnessing to vehicles and riding.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Chechushkov|first1=Igor V.|last2=Usmanova|first2=Emma R.|last3=Kosintsev|first3=Pavel A.|date=2020-08-01|title=Early evidence for horse utilization in the Eurasian steppes and the case of the Novoil'inovskiy 2 Cemetery in Kazakhstan|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X2030211X|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports|language=en|volume=32|pages=102420|doi=10.1016/j.jasrep.2020.102420|bibcode=2020JArSR..32j2420C |s2cid=225452095 |issn=2352-409X}}</ref>

"It is likely that militarized elite, whose power was based on the physical control of fellow tribesmen and neighbors with the help of riding and fighting skills, was buried in the Novoilinovsky-2 burial ground. The rider has a significant advantage over the infantryman. There may be another explanation: These elite fulfilled the function of mediating conflicts within the collective, and therefore had power and high social status. Metaphorically, this kind of elite can be called Sheriffs of the Bronze Age" said Igor Chechushkov.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The most ancient evidence of horsemanship in the bronze age|url=https://phys.org/news/2020-07-ancient-evidence-horsemanship-bronze-age.html|access-date=2020-07-20|website=phys.org|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Russian Scientists Have Discovered the Most Ancient Evidence of Horsemanship in the Bronze Age - South Ural State University|url=https://www.susu.ru/en/news/2020/07/14/russian-scientists-have-discovered-most-ancient-evidence-horsemanship-bronze-age#:~:text=the%20Bronze%20Age-,Russian%20Scientists%20Have%20Discovered%20the%20Most%20Ancient,Horsemanship%20in%20the%20Bronze%20Age&text=SUSU%20scientist%20discovered%20new%20facts,the%20monuments%20of%20Andronovo%20culture.|access-date=2020-07-20|website=www.susu.ru}}</ref>
