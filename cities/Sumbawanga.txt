'''Sumbawanga''' is a city located in western [[Tanzania]]. It is the capital of [[Regions of Tanzania|Rukwa Region]] and the municipal seat of [[Sumbawanga Urban|Sumbawanga Urban District]] with [[postcode]] [[number]] '''55100''' . The district had a population of approximately 303,986 based on the 2022 census.<ref>[http://www.citypopulation.de/en/tanzania/admin/rukwa/1504__sumbawanga_municipality/ Citypopulation.de] Population of Sumbawanga municipality</ref> Sumbawanga lies in the territory of the Wafipa [[Fipa people|Fipa]]  tribe and so many people speak [[Mambwe-Lungu language|Kifipa]], as well as [[Swahili language|Kiswahili]], the most widely used language of Tanzania.  The name of the town literally translates as "throw away your witchcraft", thought to be a warning from local spiritual "healers" to any bringing in superstitions and practices relating to spiritual healers from other areas. Until the 1980s approximately, Sumbawanga was a place where many [[Witch doctor|witch doctors]] were located. Though fewer in numbers, there are still some healers who practice both in town and in the surrounding smaller villages on the plateau. The town has the largest hospital in the region, Rukwa General Hospital, which is government funded, as well as the smaller Dr. Atiman Hospital administrated and run by the Catholic Diocese of Sumbawanga.

The town acts as a supply and commercial center for the Rukwa Region and some governmental agencies are to be found there, notably the transport department for the region. Sumbawanga has both Libori and [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] conference centres. A modest-size market is in the town centre where local produce may be found. This includes maize, rice, fruit, poultry and fish (from Lake Tanganyika and Lake Rukwa). Many imported plastic goods and electronics are available as well as bicycles and spares.  Although there are several fuel outlets, supply can be quite erratic because of the difficulties of transport from the coast.

The local economy is largely dependent on agriculture and small locally owned businesses. There is very limited industry or production in the town. Significant improvement has been made on the road to [[Mbeya]] as it is sealed to enable reliable all-weather access year round. This road, and its continuation north to Mpanda and Tabora or Kigoma, is now passable throughout the year.  The Tanzanian government has had contracts in place for upgrading large sections of these roads.  The town can be reached by flights operated by Auric Air<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.auricair.com |title= Auric Air |date= March 30, 2012 |accessdate= March 30, 2012 |work= Auric Air Services Ltd}}</ref> or by bus from [[Mbeya]] which lies to the south with train links to the town of [[Kapiri Mposhi]] in Zambia, to [[Dar es Salaam]]. Rail is also available through [[Tabora]] from [[Mpanda]] in the north.  Mpanda also has an airport with a 2&nbsp;km sealed runway.
