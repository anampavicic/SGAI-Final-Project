'''Nanded''' is a city in [[Maharashtra]] state, India. It is the [[List of cities in Maharashtra|tenth]] largest city in the state and the [[List of cities in India by population|seventy-ninth most populated city in India]]. It is the second largest city in Marathwada region. It is the district headquarters of [[Nanded district]].

[[Guru Gobind Singh]] established camp in Nanded and the Gurgaddi was transferred to him. One of the  [[Panj Takht|Panj Takhts]] of Sikhi, [[Hazur Sahib]] is located in the city of Nanded. It was here that [[Guru Gobind Singh]] initiated Madho Daas whom became [[Banda Singh Bahadur]] one of the famous leaders of the [[Khalsa|Khalsa  Panth]] whom played a role during the downfall of the [[Mughal Empire]].

==Location==
Nanded is located on the banks of river [[Godavari]] in west-central India. Nanded district borders [[Latur district]], [[Parbhani district]] and [[Hingoli district]] to the west and [[Yavatmal district]] to the north. The district is bordered by the [[Nizamabad district|Nizamabad]], [[Kamareddy district|Kamareddy]], [[Nirmal district|Nirmal]] and [[Adilabad district|Adilabad]] districts of Telangana state to the east and [[Bidar district]] of Karnataka state to the south.

Nanded has two parts: Old Nanded {{convert|20.62|km2|sqmi}} occupies the north bank of the [[Godavari]] river; New Nanded, to the south of the river, {{convert|31.14|km2|sqmi}} encompasses Waghala and neighbourhoods.

==Etymology==
From a [[Indian copper plate inscriptions|copper plate inscription]] found at [[Washim]], a town approximately {{convert|150|km|mi}} north of Nanded, archaeologists deduce the city was formerly known as {{IAST|Nanditaṭa}} ({{lang-mr|नंदितट}}).{{citation needed|date=April 2024}}  Another name was {{IAST|Nandigrāma}}.<ref>[https://www.nandedairport.co.in/web/nanded-airport/about-nanded-city Nanded City] Nanded airport Corporation website.</ref>{{Better source needed|date=April 2024}} Folklore suggests that the name "Nanded" developed from {{IAST|Nandi}} the [[Vahana]] of [[Shiva]]. Shiva was said to have performed penance on the banks ({{IAST|Taṭa}}) of the Godavari river. This "{{IAST|Nandi-taṭa}}" later became "Nanded".{{citation needed|date=April 2024}}

==History==

In the 1st century CE, power in the area lay with the [[Andhrabhrtya]]s and [[Satavahana|Satvahanas]].<ref name="(India)Dept1971">{{cite book|title=Maharashtra State Gazetteers: Nanded|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Y5hAAAAIAAJ|year=1971|publisher=Director of Government Printing, Stationery and Publications, Maharashtra State|pages=4, 576}}</ref> In the 5th and 4th centuries BCE, Nanded was ruled by the [[Nanda Empire|Nanda dynasty]]. In the 3rd century BCE (about 272 to 231 BCE), it was part of the [[Maurya Empire]] under [[Ashoka]]. Local irrigation practices and Nanded itself are recorded in the treatise, ''[[Leela Charitra]]'' (late 1200s CE).<ref name="Congress2007">{{cite book|title=Proceedings {{ndash}} Indian History Congress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GhVDAAAAYAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Indian History Congress|page=331}}</ref> Nanded was the birthplace of three Marathi poet-saints—Vishnupant Shesa, Raghunath Shesa, and Vaman Pandit<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Nanded|title=Nanded {{!}} India|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2019-12-14}}</ref> Construction of [[Kandhar Fort]], located in [[Kandhar]], is attributed to the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakuta king]] [[Krishna III]] of [[Malkheda]] who ruled around 10th century CE.

From 1636, Nanded was the centre of governance of Nizam State, which includes present-day [[Telangana]] and [[Karnataka]], and was an imperial province of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Padishah|Badshah]] (emperor) [[Shah Jahan]]. In 1657, Nanded merged into Bidah Subah. [[Guru Nanak]] (1469 {{ndash}} 1539 CE) passed through Nanded on his way to [[Sri Lanka]]. [[Guru Gobind Singh]] (1666 {{ndash}} 1708 CE) arrived in Nanded with the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal emperor]] [[Bahadur Shah I]] (1643 {{ndash}} 1712 CE) near the end of August in 1707 CE. When Bahadur Shah moved on to [[Golconda]], Guru Gobind Singh remained in Nanded. Guru Gobind Singh proclaimed he was the last (tenth) living guru and established the sacred text, the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] as an eternal "living" leader. Guru Gobind Singh died without a [[lineal descendant]] due to the [[Martyrdom in Sikhism|martyrdom]] of his four sons.<ref>{{cite book|title=Journal of the United Service Institution of India, Volumes 1-2|date=1871|publisher=[[United Service Institution|United Service Institution of India]]|page=58}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The Sikh Review|journal=Sikh Cultural Centre|date=1972|volume=20|issue=218–229|page=28}}</ref>

In 1725, Nanded became part of [[Hyderabad State]].<ref name="(India)Dept1971"/> In about 1835, [[Maharaja]] [[Ranjit Singh]] commissioned the construction of a [[gurdwara]] at Nanded with the financial aid of [[Sikander Jah]] (3rd [[Nizam]] of hyderabad)<ref name="Nizam aid">{{cite web |title=The Tribune - Windows - Feature |url=https://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020706/windows/main3.htm |website=www.tribuneindia.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.livehistoryindia.com/story/monuments/nanded-gurdwara-shrine-of-the-holy-book | title=Nanded Gurdwara: Shrine of the Holy Book | date=11 February 2020 }}</ref> It was built on the site of Guru Gobind Singh's [[cremation]]. The gurdwara is part of the [[Hazur Sahib Nanded|Hazur Sahib]].

After India [[Independence Day (India)|gained independence]] in 1947, the [[Indian Armed Forces]] annexed Hyderabad and ended the rule of the Nizam in [[Operation Polo]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hyderabad.co.uk/policeaction.htm |title=Police Action |first=Mohan |last=Guruswamy |publisher=Hyderabad on the Net |access-date=31 July 2012}}</ref> making Nanded part of the [[Hyderabad State (1948–56)|new Hyderabad State]].
