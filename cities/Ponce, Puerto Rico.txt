===19th-century immigrants===
In the early 19th century, Ponce continued to be one of dozens of hamlets that dotted the Island. Its inhabitants survived by [[subsistence agriculture]], [[cattle raising]], and [[sea|maritime]] [[contraband]] with foreigners. Mayor [[José Benítez (mayor)|José Benítez]] categorized the jurisdiction into ''cotos'', ''hatos'', ''criaderos'', ''monterías'', and ''terrenos realengos''.<ref>Eduardo Neumann Gandía. ''Verdadera y Autentica Historia de la Ciudad de Ponce.'' Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña. 1913. p. 259.</ref> ''Cotos'' were lands awarded to residents as reward for their services to the king. They were developed into [[estancias]] or lands apt to be cultivated for agricultural use. ''Hatos'' were lands not granted to anyone in particular, but available for communal use where cattle could roam at will. ''Monterías'' were hilly areas located next to ''hatos'' were cattle could be reigned in or gathered together with the help of trained dogs. ''Criaderos'' were lands were cows could be herded for milk production. Goats, sheep, pigs, asses, and mares were also herded in ''criaderos''. ''Terrenos realengos'' were lands that belonged to the state (to the king).<ref>'Neysa Rodriguez Deynes. ''Brevario sobre la Historia de Ponce.'' Gobierno Municipal de Ponce. Oficina de Cultura y Turismo. 2002. p. 37.</ref><ref>Eduardo Neumann Gandía. ''Verdadera y Autentica Historia de la Ciudad de Ponce.'' Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña. 1913. pp. 67-68.</ref>

However, in the 1820s, three events dramatically changed the size of the town. The first of these events was the arrival of a significant number of white [[Geographical distribution of French speakers|Francophones]], fleeing the [[Haitian Revolution]] of 1791–1804.<ref name="Eduardo Neumann Gandia 1913. p. 38">Eduardo Neumann Gandia. ''Verdadera y Autentica Historia de la Ciudad de Ponce.'' 1913. Reprinted in 1987. San Juan, Puerto Rico: Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña. p. 38.</ref> The effect of this mass migration was not felt significantly until the 1820s. These French Creole [[entrepreneurs]] were attracted to the area because of its large flatlands, and they came with enough capital, [[slaves]], and commercial connections to stimulate Ponce's [[sugarcane]] production and sales.<ref name="Figueroa 2006 p.">{{cite book | last=Figueroa | first=L.A. | title=Sugar, Slavery, and Freedom in Nineteenth-Century Puerto Rico | publisher=University of North Carolina Press | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-8078-7683-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=quXtGrIOlRsC | access-date=22 August 2019 | pages=32–55}}</ref>

Secondly, [[landlords]] and [[merchants]] migrated from various Latin American countries. They had migrated for better conditions, as they were leaving economic decline following the revolutions and disruption of societies as nations gained independence from Spain in the 1810s-1820s.<ref name="Eduardo Neumann Gandia 1913. p. 38"/>

Third, the Spanish [[Royal Decree of Graces of 1815]] attracted numerous European immigrants to Puerto Rico. It encouraged any citizen of a country politically friendly to Spain to settle in Puerto Rico as long as they converted to the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] faith and agreed to work in the [[agriculture|agricultural]] business. With such mass migrations, not only the size of the town was changed, but the character of its population was changed as well. Europeans, including many [[Protestants]], immigrated from a variety of nations.<ref>Francisco A. Scarano. ''Puerto Rico: Cinco Siglos de Historia.'' McGraw-Hill/Interamericana Editores, S.A. de C. V. 2000.

Following trends set in Europe and elsewhere, in 1877, [[Miguel Rosich y Mass|Don Miguel Rosich]] conceived an exposition for Ponce. This was approved in 1880, and the Ponce Fair was held in the city in 1882. It showed several industrial and agricultural advancements.

On March 21, 1937, a peaceful march was organized by the [[Puerto Rican Nationalist Party]] to celebrate the 64th anniversary of the abolition of slavery and protest the incarceration of their leader, Dr. [[Pedro Albizu Campos]], in a federal prison on charges of [[sedition]].<ref name="llmc.com">[http://www.llmc.com/TitleLLMC.asp?ColID=3&Cat=136&TID=7037&TName=Ponce%20Massacre,%20Com.%20of%20Inquiry,%201937 ''Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Civil Rights in Puerto Rico.''

====Hub for political and economic activity====
Ponce has continued to be a hub of political activity on the island, and is the founding site of several major political parties. It has also been the birthplace of several important political figures of the island, including [[Luis A. Ferré]] and [[Rafael Hernández Colón]], both former [[Governor of Puerto Rico|governors of Puerto Rico]], as well as the childhood town of governor [[Roberto Sanchez Vilella]].

Statistics taken from the 2010 census show that 82.0% of Ponceños are [[White people|white]] and 9.0% are [[Black people|African-American]], with [[Taíno]]s, [[Asian people|Asian]]s, people of [[multiethnic|mixed race]] and others making up the rest.<ref name="factfinder.census.gov"/> At 82.0% vs. 76.2% for the island as a whole, Ponce has the highest concentration of white population of any municipality in Puerto Rico.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=MjXG2vg5YFsC&pg=PA224 ''Puerto Rico, A Travel Guide.''] Randall Peffer.

====1970s economic decline====
The 1970s brought significant commercial, industrial and banking changes to Ponce that dramatically altered its financial stability and outlook of the city, the municipality and, to an extent, the entire southern Puerto Rico region. After [[Luis A. Ferre]] concluded his term as governor of Puerto Rico on January 1, 1973, he closed the [[Puerto Rico Iron Works]] foundry on [[Puerto Rico Highway 123|Avenida Hostos]], and transferred the offices of Ponce's island-wide [[El Nuevo Dia|El Dia]] newspaper that he owned, as well as the headquarters of his [[Empresas Ferré]], to San Juan. In 1976, [[CORCO]]—southern Puerto Rico's main source of economic vitality—shut down its industrial operations in [[Guayanilla]] leaving thousands of area residents without work; its impact on indirect sources of employment was even greater. Also, the sugar cane industry, also suffered a major downturn. Sugar cane had until 1976 been grown and refined at Ponce's [[Central Mercedita]], but in that year agricultural production of sugar cane was halted in the lands of the municipality of Ponce and adjacent towns. Also, the headquarters of [[Banco de Ponce]] and [[Banco Crédito y Ahorro Ponceño]] were moved to San Juan. Unemployment of Ponce jumped to 25% as a result of these changes.<ref>Reinaldo E.

Ponce's municipal territory reaches the [[Cordillera Central (Puerto Rico)|central mountain range]] to the north and the Caribbean Sea to the south. Geographically speaking, the southern area of the territory is part of the Ponce-Patillas alluvial plain subsector and the southern coastal plain, which were created by the consolidation of the valleys of the southern side of the central mountain range and the Cayey mountain range. The central area of the municipality is part of the semi-arid southern hills. These two regions are classified as being the driest on the island. The northern part of the municipality is considered to be within the rainy western mountains.<ref>[http://www.enciclopediapr.org/ing/print_version.cfm?ref=09012901 "Ponce, Geography."

During the 19th century, the city was witness to a flourishing architectural development, including the birth of a new architectural style later dubbed [[Ponce Creole]]. Architects like Francisco Valls, [[Manuel V. Domenech|Manuel Víctor Domenech]], Eduardo Salich, [[Blas Silva|Blas Silva Boucher]], Agustín Camilo González, Alfredo Wiechers, [[Francisco Porrata Doria]] and Francisco Gardón Vega used a mixture of [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassic]] styles to give the city a unique look. This can be seen in the various structures located in the center of the city like the [[Teatro La Perla]].

Ponce has nine barrios that border neighboring municipalities. These are [[Canas, Ponce, Puerto Rico|Canas]], [[Quebrada Limón]], [[Marueño]], [[Guaraguao]], [[San Patricio, Ponce, Puerto Rico|San Patricio]], [[Anón]], [[Real, Ponce, Puerto Rico|Real]], [[Coto Laurel]], and [[Capitanejo, Ponce, Puerto Rico|Capitanejo]]. Canas and Capitanejo are also coastal barrios, and together with three others ([[Playa, Ponce, Puerto Rico|Playa]], [[Bucaná]], and [[Vayas]]) make up the municipality's five coastal barrios.

There are also five barrios within the city limits ([[Canas Urbano]], [[Machuelo Abajo]], [[Magueyes Urbano]], [[Portugués Urbano]], and [[San Antón]]) that in addition to the original six city core barrios — named [[Primero, Ponce, Puerto Rico|Primero]], [[Segundo, Ponce, Puerto Rico|Segundo]], [[Tercero, Ponce, Puerto Rico|Tercero]], [[Cuarto, Ponce, Puerto Rico|Cuarto]], [[Quinto, Ponce, Puerto Rico|Quinto]], and [[Sexto, Ponce, Puerto Rico|Sexto]] — make up the 11 urban zone barrios of the municipality. The [[Ponce Historic Zone|historic zone]] of the city is within these original six core city barrios. These eleven barrios composed what is known as the urban zone of the municipality.

The remaining eight barrios ([[Magueyes]], [[Tibes]], [[Montes Llanos]], [[Maragüez]], [[Portugués Rural|Portugués]], [[Machuelo Arriba]], [[Cerrillos, Ponce, Puerto Rico|Cerrillos]], [[Sabanetas, Ponce, Puerto Rico|Sabanetas]]) are located in the interior of the municipality.

[[Plaza Las Delicias]], the town's main square, features a prominent fountain (namely, the "Lions Fountain"), the [[Ponce Cathedral]], and [[Parque de Bombas]], an old fire house, now a museum, that stands as an iconic symbol of the city and a tribute to the bravery of its firefighters. This plaza is also a usual gathering place for "ponceños". Other buildings around Ponce's main plaza include the Casa Alcaldía ([[Ponce City Hall]]), the oldest colonial building in the city, dating to the 1840s, and the [[Armstrong-Poventud Residence]], an example of the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] architectural heritage of the island.

Just north of downtown Ponce lies the [[Castillo Serrallés]] and the [[Cruceta del Vigía]], a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} observation tower which overlooks the city.

Also in the city outskirts is [[Hacienda Buena Vista]], an estate built in 1833 originally to grow fruits. It was converted into a [[coffee]] [[plantation]] and [[gristmill]] in 1845. It remained in operation until 1937, then fell into disrepair, but was restored by the government's ''Fideicomiso de Conservación de Puerto Rico''. All the machinery works (the metal parts) are original, operated by water channeled from the 360m Vives waterfall; there is a hydraulic [[turbine]] which makes the corn mill work.

[[Paseo Tablado La Guancha]] is located in the town's sea shore. It features kiosks with food and beverages, an open-space stage for activities, and a [[marina]] called [[Club Náutico de Ponce]]. From the observation tower on the boardwalk, [[Cardona Island Light]] can be seen. A 45-minute boat ride is also available to [[Isla de Caja de Muertos, Puerto Rico|Isla de Caja de Muertos]] (Coffin Island), a small island with several beaches and an 1887 [[Caja de Muertos Light|lighthouse]].

The city values its cultural traditions as evidenced by the revitalization project ''Ponce en Marcha.'' It is deeply rooted in its traditional cultural, artistic, and musical heritage. The love for art and architecture, for example, can be appreciated at its museums of art, music, and architecture.
<blockquote>"Over the last century or so, the north [i.e., San Juan] willingly accepted the influence of [[western culture]] with its tendency toward large sprawling metropolises, and the displacement of old values and attitudes. Ponce, on the other hand, has been content to retain its old [[traditions]] and [[culture]]. Ponce is not concerned about losing its long standing position as the second largest city in population after San Juan.

Artistic development also flourished during this period. The surging of popular rhythms like [[Bomba (Puerto Rico)|Bomba]] and [[Plena]] took place in the south region of the island, mainly in Ponce. Barrio San Antón is known as one of the birthplaces of the rhythm. Every July, Ponce celebrates an annual festival of Bomba and Plena, which includes various musicians and parades.

Immigrants from Spain, Italy, France, Germany, and England came to Ponce to develop an international city that still maintains rich [[Taíno people|Taíno]] and African heritage. The African personality, belief, and music add flavor and colorful rhythm to Ponce's culture. Part of this are the influences of the [[Bomba (Puerto Rico)|Bomba]] and [[Plena]] rhythms.

===Religion===
During and after colonization, the Roman Catholic Church became the established religion of the colony. Gradually African slaves were converted to Christianity, but many incorporated their own traditions and symbols, maintaining African traditions as well. [[Ponce Cathedral]], listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]], was built in 1839.<ref>[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/ponc0.htm GCatholic.org: GCatholic.org.

The [[Ponce City Hall]] has one of the most unusual histories of any city hall throughout the world. "Originally built in the 1840s as a public assembly hall, Ponce's City Hall was a jail until the end of the 19th century. Current galleries were former cells, and executions were held in the courtyard. Four U.S. presidents spoke from the balcony - Theodore Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover, Franklin Roosevelt and George Bush." It is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.planetware.com/tourist-attractions/puerto-rico-pr.htm#PR-PR-P|title=10 Top-Rated Tourist Attractions in Puerto Rico - PlanetWare|website=planetware}}</ref>

===Coat of arms===
The [[coat of arms]] of the municipality is based on the design of the official mayoral seal that was adopted in 1844 under the administration of mayor [[Salvador de Vives]].<ref name="visitponce.com">{{Cite web |url=http://www.visitponce.com/escudo.aspx |title=Ponce Coat of Arms.

The coat of arms of Ponce consists of an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] (shield) in the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)#Points|Spanish]] tradition. This shield has a [[field (heraldry)|field]] with a [[Heraldry#Divisions of the field|party per bend]] division. The division runs from top left to bottom right. The field is red and black, bordered with a fine golden line. In the center of the shield is the figure of an erect lion standing on a bridge. The top of the bridge is a golden, the middle is red bricks, and the base foundation is gray rocks. Under the bridge there are gray wavy lines. Over the shield rests a five-tower golden stone wall with openings in the form of red windows. To the left of the shield is a coffee tree branch with its fruit, and to the right of the shield is a sugarcane stalk. The symbols of the shield are as follows: The field represents the flag of the municipality of Ponce, divided diagonally in the traditional city colors: red and black. The lion over the bridge alludes to the last name of the conqueror and first governor of Puerto Rico, Juan Ponce de Leon. The waves under the bridge allude to the Rio Portugues, on the banks of which the city was born. The [[coronet]] in the form of a five-tower mural crown above the shield allude to the [[Spanish crown]], through which the settlement obtained its city charter. The coffee tree branch and the sugarcane stalk represent the main agricultural basis of the economy of the young municipality.<ref name="visitponce.com"/>

Ponce has two official flags, one for the municipality and one for the city proper. The municipal flag, "the 1692 flag", was adopted in 1967 via a [[municipal ordinance]]. This flag, designed by Mario Ramirez, was selected from among a number of public proposals. It consisted of a rectangular cloth divided by a diagonal line into two equal [[Triangle#Types of triangle|isosceles triangle]]s. The line ran from the top right-hand corner to the bottom left-hand corner. The top triangle was black; the bottom right triangle was red. On the top triangle was the figure of a lion over a bridge. On the bottom triangle was the word "Ponce" with the number "1692", the date when the municipality was founded. Ponce Municipal Assembly Order No. 5, Section 5, of Municipal Assembly Year 1966-1967 established that the last Sunday in April is "Día de la Bandera de Ponce" (Ponce Flag Day).<ref>[https://www.periodicolaperla.com/28-de-abril-a-punto-para-otro-dia-de-la-bandera-poncena/ ''28 de abril: a punto para otro Día de la Bandera Ponceña: Aunque muchos no nos demos cuenta, existen alrededor de cinco versiones de la bandera ponceña debido a revisiones y celebraciones de momentos históricos.''] Melina Aguilar Colón and Ernie Zavier Rivera Collazo.

Ten years later, in 1977, a new municipal ordinance introduced a flag, "the 1877 city flag" to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the declaration of the ''city'' charter. This (1977) flag consisted of a rectangular cloth divided by a diagonal line, creating two equal isosceles triangles, starting from the top left hand corner and ending on the lower right hand corner. The top triangle is red; the bottom triangle is black. In the center of the flag sits the shield of the municipality. Under this shield is the number "1877", the year of the founding of the city, and above the shield is the word "PONCE". Some flags have the "1877" date on the left border of the bottom triangle and the name of the city on the right border of the triangle, as illustrated in the insert on the left.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.visitponce.com/bandera.aspx |title=Flag of Ponce.

The city's fire department has a history of firsts, including being the first organized fire department in the Island. As the largest city in the island at the time, and ''de facto'' economic and social center of Puerto Rico, this in effect also created the first [[Puerto Rico Fire Department]]. The Ponce Fire Department also built the first fire station in the Island,<ref>

The fire started at the U.S. munitions depot on the lot currently occupied by the [[Ponce High School]] building and grounds. The heroes in that fire, believed to have saved the city from certain annihilation, are remembered to this day with monuments on their tombs as well as in a monument in the city square [[Plaza Las Delicias]].<ref name="bomberos.gobierno.pr"/> As a further gesture of gratitude, a neighborhood of distinctive Victorian-style cottages were constructed to house the firefighters and their families. These houses, painted in the red and black colors of the city, are located along a street named [[Calle 25 de Enero]] (''25 de Enero street''); they are still owned and occupied by the descendants of these firefighters and are a scenic attraction in Ponce's historic center.

====Crime====
In 2002, most of the homicides in Puerto Rico were occurring in San Juan and the greater metropolitan areas of Bayamón, Carolina and Caguas, but Ponce also had a high homicide rate. Also in 2002, Puerto Rico law enforcement officials drafted plans to increase the number of forensic investigators by 25%. The investigators, assigned to the Institute of Forensic Sciences in San Juan, covered homicides in about 65 percent of the island, but the Institute was considering assigning Ponce its own unit.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120911052502/http://www.streetgangs.com/topics/2002/081202pr.html Spreading drug war bloodies: Puerto Rico Homicide rate is more than three times U.S. average.

The police acknowledged that most crime cases in Puerto Rico are linked to drug-trafficking and illegal weapons. In mid-July 2005, Gov. [[Aníbal Acevedo Vilá]] announced a series of measures aimed at lowering Ponce's high murder rate. Some of those measures included the permanent transfer of 100 agents to the area, the appointment of a ballistics expert from the Institute of Forensic Sciences and of two prosecutors for the Department of Justice in Ponce. Puerto Rico Police Superintendent [[Pedro Toledo]] admitted that more than 100 agents are actually needed in the Ponce region in 2005, but that "there would be no additional transfers at the moment to avoid affecting other police areas."<ref name="Puerto Rico Herald. 14 July 2005"/>

Ponce is a convenient transition point for drug smugglers due to its location on the Caribbean Sea and its proximity to [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]].<ref name="Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Page 5">{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/ndic-moved.html|title=U.S. Department of Justice National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC)|website=Justice}}</ref> From there packages are then transported to the United States by various means including the [[United States Postal Service]].<ref name="Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Page 5"/> The city is included in the area's [[HIDTA]] region.<ref name="Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Page 5"/>

As most of the crime in Ponce is connected to the drug-trade, police have an eye on illegal smuggling through the [[Port of Ponce]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mapcarta.com/Puerto_Rico|title=Puerto Rico|website=Mapcarta}}</ref> A 2008 government report stated that, "Drug smuggling in containerized cargo is a significant maritime threat to the HIDTA (High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area) region. The vast and increasing quantity of goods transshipped through the region every year provides drug traffickers with ample opportunity to smuggle illicit drugs into, through, and from the area.<ref name="Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Page 5"/> In July 2005, local police scored some points in their fight against drug-trafficking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/puertorico/traffickers.htm|title=Successes are hard-won in war on traffickers|website= Latin American Studies}}</ref>
