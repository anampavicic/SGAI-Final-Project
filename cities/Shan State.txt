'''Shan State''' ({{langx|shn|မိူင်းတႆး|italics=no}}, {{transliteration|shn|Möng Tai}}; {{langx|my|ရှမ်းပြည်နယ်}}, {{IPA-my|ʃáɰ̃ pjìnɛ̀|pron}}) is a [[administrative divisions of Myanmar|state]] of [[Myanmar]]. Shan State borders [[China]] ([[Yunnan]]) to the north, [[Laos]] ([[Louang Namtha Province|Louang Namtha]] and [[Bokeo Province]]s) to the east, and [[Thailand]] ([[Chiang Rai Province|Chiang Rai]], [[Chiang Mai Province|Chiang Mai]] and [[Mae Hong Son Province]]s) to the south, and five administrative divisions of Myanmar in the west. The largest of the 14 administrative divisions by land area, Shan State covers 155,800&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, almost a quarter of the total area of Myanmar. The state gets its name from the Burmese name for the Tai peoples: "[[Shan people]]". The Tai (Shan) constitute the majority among several ethnic groups that inhabit the area. Shanland is largely rural, with only three cities of significant size: [[Lashio]], [[Kengtung]], and the capital, [[Taunggyi]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Shan: largest cities and towns and statistics of their population|work=World Gazetteer|url=http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&men=gcis&lng=en&dat=80&geo=-141&srt=npan&col=aohdqgbeinfc&msz=1500&pt=c&va=&geo=-2463|access-date=19 January 2008}}{{dead link|date=July 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Taunggyi is 150.7&nbsp;km northeast of the nation's capital [[Naypyitaw]].

The Shan state, with many ethnic groups, is home to several armed ethnic groups. While the [[State Peace and Development Council|military government]] has signed ceasefire agreements with most groups, vast areas of the state, especially those east of the [[Salween River]], remain outside the central government's control, and in recent years have come under heavy ethnic-[[Burmese Chinese|Han Chinese]] economic and political influence. Other areas are under the control of military groups such as the [[Shan State Army-South|Shan State Army]].

According to data from the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC), Shan State is the region that produces the most [[opium]] in Myanmar, though production has declined in recent years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/documents/southeastasiaandpacific//Publications/2021/Myanmar_Opium_survey_2020.pdf|title=Myanmar Opium Survey 2020: Cultivation, Production and Implications|date=February 2021}}</ref>

== Names and etymology ==
'''Muang Tai''' ([[Shan language|Shan]]: {{lang-my-Mymr|မိူင်းတႆး}}) is the native name for the region as well as a term used for the Tai-inhabited parts of Myanmar outside of Shan State. ''Muang'' (မိူင်း) means country in Tai languages and is used before the names of other countries, e.g. ''Muang Maan'' (Myanmar).<ref>{{Cite web|title=SEALang Shan Dictionary|url=http://sealang.net/shan/dictionary.htm|website=SEALang}}</ref>

'''Shan Pyi''' ({{langx|my|ရှမ်းပြည်}}) derives from a Burmese corruption of the name ''Siam'' which is an old name for [[Central Thailand|Lower Thailand]]. ''Pyi'' is a Burmese word meaning country and thus ''Shan Pyi'' can be translated as Shan State. Officially, the region is called ''Shan State'' in English and ''Shan Pyine'' in Burmese but the ''ne'' in often dropped in colloquial speech.

'''Lanjao''' ([[Shan language|Shan]]: လၢၼ်ႉၸဝ်ႈ) or [[Nanzhao]] is a classical name for a kingdom which included most of the land that makes up modern Shan State. Lanjao, alongside ''Muang Tai'' are often used in political and nationalist dialogue when referring to the region.<ref>{{Cite web |last=မွၼ်းၶိူဝ်း |date=2022-08-24 |title=လၢၼ့်ၸဝ်ႈ ၸွင်ႇၸႂ်ႈတႆး |url=https://shannews.org/archives/36419 |access-date=2024-10-06 |website=SHAN News |language=en-US}}</ref>

Shan State is the unitary successor state to the Burmese Shan States, the [[princely states]] that were under some degree of control of the [[Irrawaddy river|Irrawaddy valley]]-based Burmese kingdoms.

Historical [[Tai Nua people|Tai-Mao]] states extended well beyond the Burmese Shan States, ranging from full-fledged kingdoms of [[Ahom kingdom|Assam]] in the northwest to [[Lan Xang]] in the east, to [[Lan Na]] and [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] in the southeast, as well as several petty princely states in between, covering present-day northern [[Chin State]], northern [[Sagaing Division]], [[Kachin State]], [[Kayah State]] in Myanmar as well as [[Laos]], [[Thailand]] and the southwestern part of [[Yunnan]], China. The definition of Burmese Shan States does not include the [[Ava Kingdom]] and the [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom]] of the 13th to 16th centuries, although the founders of these kingdoms were Burmanized Shans and Monized Shans, respectively.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

===Early history===
The founding of Shan States inside the present-day boundaries of Burma began during the [[Pagan Kingdom]] in the [[Shan Hills]] and accelerated after 1287, when the Pagan Kingdom fell to the [[Mongols]]. The Tai people, who came south with the Mongols, stayed, and quickly came to dominate much of northern to the eastern arc of Burma—from northwestern [[Sagaing Division]] to [[Kachin Hills]] to the present-day Shan Hills. The most powerful Shan states were [[Mongyang State|Mong Yang]] (Mohnyin) and [[Mongkawng|Mong Kawng]] (Mogaung) in present-day Kachin State, followed by [[Hsenwi State|Hsenwi]] (Theinni), [[Hsipaw]] (Thibaw) and [[Mongmit|Mong Mit]] (Momeik) in present-day northern Shan State.<ref name=jf>{{cite journal | title=Min-gyi-nyo, the Shan Invasions of Ava (1524–27), and the Beginnings of Expansionary Warfare in Toungoo Burma: 1486–1539 | author=Jon Fernquest | date=Autumn 2005 | journal=SOAS Bulletin of Burma Research|volume=3|issue=2 | issn=1479-8484}}</ref> Smaller Shan states, such as [[Kalay|Kale]] in northwestern [[Sagaing Division]], [[Bhamo]] in Kachin State, [[Yawnghwe]] (Nyaungshwe) and [[Kengtung State|Kengtung]] (Kyaingtong) in Shan State, and [[Mong Pai]] (Mobye) in [[Kayah State]], played a precarious game of paying allegiance to more powerful states, sometimes simultaneously.

The newly founded Shan States were multi-ethnic, and included other ethnic minorities such as the [[Chin people|Chin]], the [[Kachin people|Kachin]], the [[Wa people|Wa]], the [[Palaung people|Ta'ang]], the Lisu, the Lahu, the Pa O, and the [[Kayah people|Kayah]]. Although Burmanised Shans founded the [[Ava Kingdom]] that ruled central Burma, other Shan states, Mohnyin in particular, constantly raided Ava territories throughout the years. A Mohnyin-led [[Confederation of Shan States]] finally conquered Ava in 1527.<ref name=Htin>{{cite book | title=A History of Burma| publisher=Columbia University Press | location=New York| year=1967 | first=Maung|last= Htin Aung|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofburma0000htin | url-access=registration| author-link=Htin Aung}}</ref>{{RP|95}}

===Toungoo and Konbaung periods (1555–1885)===
[[File:Map of Toungoo Kingdom 1752.jpg|thumb|Shan States after 1557, then inside Bayinnaung's empire]]

In 1555, King [[Bayinnaung]] dislodged Shan king [[Sithu Kyawhtin]] from Ava. By 1557 he went on to conquer all of what would become known as the Burmese Shan states under his rule, from the Assamese border in the northwest to those in [[Kachin Hills]] and [[Shan Hills]], including the two most powerful Shan states, Mohnyin and Mogaung.<ref name=Phayre>{{cite book | title=History of Burma | author=Lt.

Bayinnaung introduced Burmese customary law and prohibited all human and animal sacrifices. He also required the sons of Saophas to reside in the Burmese king's palace, essentially hostages, in order to ensure the good conduct of their fathers and to receive training in Burmese court life. Burmese kings continued this policy until 1885 when the kingdom fell to the British.<ref name="Htin" />{{RP|117–118}} (The northernmost Shan states, in Yunnan, had already fallen to the Chinese [[Ming dynasty]] by the middle of the 15th century.<ref>{{cite book | title=Asian borderlands: the transformation of Qing China's Yunnan frontier | author=Charles Patterson Giersch | year=2006 | publisher=Harvard University Press | isbn=9780674021716 | page=27}}</ref>)

The reach of the Burmese sovereign waxed and waned with the ability of each Burmese monarch. Shan states became briefly independent following the collapse of the first Toungoo dynasty, in 1599. The Restored Toungoo dynasty under King [[Nyaungyan Min|Nyaungyan]] and King [[Anaukpetlun]] recovered the Shan states, including the two strongest—Monhyin and Mogaung by 1605 and Lan Na by 1615.<ref name=Phayre />{{RP|108}} In the early-18th century, the rule of Burmese monarchs declined rapidly and by the 1730s, the northernmost Shan states, many of which had paid dual tribute to China and Burma, had been annexed by the [[Qing Dynasty]] of China. The annexed border states ranged from Mogaung and Bhamo in present-day Kachin State to Hsenwi and Kengtung in present-day Shan State to [[Chiang Hung|Sipsongpanna]] (Kyaingyun) in present-day [[Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture]], Yunnan.<ref name="Phayre" />{{RP|191–192, 201}}

In the middle of the 18th century, the Burmese [[Konbaung dynasty]]'s reassertion of the easternmost boundaries of Burmese Shan states led to war with China. It made [[Sino-Burmese War (1765–1769)|four separate invasions]] of Burma from 1765 to 1769, during the Sino-Burmese War. The Burmese success in repelling Chinese forces laid the foundation for the present-day boundary between Burma and China.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{dubious|date=September 2017}}

The present-day boundary of southern Shan State vis-à-vis Thailand was formed shortly thereafter. Burma lost southern Lan Na (Chiang Mai) in 1776 and northern Lan Na ([[Chiang Saen]]) in 1786 to a resurgent Bangkok-based Siam,<ref name=dkw-125>{{cite book | author=David K Wyatt | title=Thailand: A Short History | page=125 | edition=2nd | year=2003 | isbn= 978-0-300-08475-7}}</ref> ending more than two centuries of Burmese suzerainty over the region. It retained only Kengtung on the Burmese side. The southern border of Shan State remained contested in the following years. Siam invaded Kengtung in [[Burmese–Siamese War (1803–08)|1803–1804]] and [[Burmese–Siamese War (1849–55)|1852–1854]], and Burma invaded Lan Na in [[Burmese–Siamese War (1797)|1797]] and 1804. Siam occupied Kengtung during [[World War II]] (1942–1945).

Throughout the Burmese feudal era, Shan states supplied much manpower in the service of Burmese kings. Without Shan manpower, the [[Bamar people|Burman]]s alone would not have been able to achieve their victories in Lower Burma, Siam, and elsewhere. Shans were a major part of Burmese forces in the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] of 1824–1826, and fought valiantly—a fact that the British commanders acknowledged.<ref name="Myint-U">{{cite book |last1=Myint-U |first1=Thant |title=The River of Lost Footsteps: Histories of Burma |date=2006 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |location=New York |isbn=9780374163426 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1jOmA2jlatsC |access-date=19 October 2019}}</ref>{{RP|123-124}}

After the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]] of 1852, the Burmese kingdom was reduced to Upper Burma alone. The Shan states—especially that east of the [[Salween River]], were essentially autonomous entities, paying token tribute to the king. In 1875, King [[Mindon Min|Mindon]], to avoid certain defeat, ceded [[Karenni States|Karenni states]], long part of Shan states, to the British.<ref name="Htin" />{{RP|177}} When the last king of Burma, [[Thibaw Min]], ascended the throne in 1878, the rule of central government was so weak that Thibaw had to send thousands of troops to tame a rebellion in the Shan state of Mongnai and other eastern Shan states for the remainder of his six-year reign.<ref name="Myint-U" />{{RP|161}}

===Colonial period (1886–1948)===
[[File:Shan trader.jpg|thumb|Shan trader, circa 1900]]
On 28 November 1885, the British captured [[Mandalay]], officially ending the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War]] in 11 days. But it took until 1890 for the British to subdue all of the various Shan states. Under the [[British Empire|British]] [[Colony|colonial]] administration, established in 1887, the Shan states were ruled by their [[saopha]]s as [[feudatory]] [[princely states]] of the [[British Crown]]. The British placed Kachin Hills inside Mandalay Division and northwestern Shan areas under Sagaing Division. In October 1922, the Shan and the [[Karenni States|Karenni states]] were merged to create the [[Federated Shan States]],<ref name=md>{{cite web | url=http://www.statoids.com/umm.html | title=Myanmar Divisions | access-date=10 April 2009 | publisher=Statoids}}</ref> under a commissioner who also administered the [[Wa States]]. This arrangement survived the constitutional changes of 1923 and 1937.

During World War II, most of the Shan states were occupied by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]]. Chinese [[Kuomintang]] forces who illegally entered Burmese territory came down to northeastern Shan states to face the Japanese. Thai forces, allied with the Japanese, occupied [[Kengtung]] and [[Saharat Thai Doem|surrounding areas]] in 1942, [[annexation|annexing]] the territory to the Thai state.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cpamedia.com/history/thailand_in_shan_state/ | title=Thailand in Shan State | access-date=10 April 2009 | author=Andrew Forbes | work=Bangkok Post | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928015558/http://www.cpamedia.com/history/thailand_in_shan_state/ | archive-date=28 September 2007 }}</ref>

After the war, the British returned, while many Chinese KMT forces stayed inside Burmese Shan states. Negotiations leading to independence at the [[Panglong Conference]] in February 1947 secured a unitary Shan State, including former Wa states, but without the Karenni states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs/panglong_agreement.htm|title=The Panglong Agreement, 1947|publisher=Online Burma/Myanmar Library}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://zomilibrary.com/main/archive/files/the-frontier-areas-committee-of-enquiry---1947_79cdb922ea.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008011757/http://zomilibrary.com/main/archive/files/the-frontier-areas-committee-of-enquiry---1947_79cdb922ea.pdf |archive-date=8 October 2011 }}</ref> More importantly, Shan State gained the right of secession in 10 years from independence.

===Independence (1948–2010)===
Soon after gaining independence in January 1948, the central government led by [[U Nu]] faced several armed rebellions. The most serious was the Chinese Nationalist KMT invasion of Shan State in 1950. Driven out by the Chinese Communist forces, Nationalist KMT armies planned to use the region east of the Salween River as a base from which to regain their homeland. In March 1953, the KMT forces, with US assistance, were on the verge of taking the entire Shan State and within a day's march of the state capital [[Taunggyi]].<ref name="Myint-U" />{{RP|274}} The Burmese army drove the invaders east across the Salween, but much of the KMT army and their [[Offspring|progeny]] have remained in the eastern Shan State under various guises to the present day. The Burmese army's heavy-handedness fueled resentment.<ref name="Myint-U" />{{RP|274}}

In 1961, Shan saophas led by [[Sao Shwe Thaik]], the first president of Burma and saopha of [[Nyaung Shwe|Yawnghwe]], proposed a new federal system of government for greater autonomy, although the Shans had the constitutional right to secede. Though Shan leaders promised not to exercise the right, the Burmese army led by Gen. [[Ne Win]] thought the proposal was secessionist.<ref name="Myint-U" />{{RP|274}} Gen. [[Ne Win]]'s [[coup d'état]] in 1962 brought an end to the Burmese experiment with democracy and with it, the call for greater autonomy for ethnic minorities. The coup fueled the Shan rebellion, started in 1958 by a small group called ''Num Hsük Han'' ('young warriors'), now joined by the [[Shan State Army]] (SSA).

By the early-1960s, eastern Shan State festered with several insurgencies and warlords, and it emerged as a major opium-growing area, part of the so-called [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]]. Narcotics trafficking became a vital source of revenue for all insurgencies. Major forces consisted of the SSA and the [[Communist Party of Burma]] (CPB), as well as those of the drug lords [[Khun Sa]], and [[Lo Hsing Han]]. By the mid-1960s, CPB had begun receiving open support from China. Thailand also began a decades-long policy of support for non-communist Burmese rebels. Families of insurgent leaders were allowed to live in Thailand, where insurgent armies were free to buy arms, ammunition, and other supplies.<ref name="Myint-U" />{{RP|299}}

In the late-1980s and 1990s, the [[State Peace and Development Council|military government]] signed ceasefire agreements with 17 groups, including all major players in Shan State. An uneasy truce has ensued, but all forces remain heavily armed. Today, the 20,000-strong [[United Wa State Army]] (UWSA) is the largest armed group, and is heavily involved in the narcotics trade.

Most of the Shan State is a hilly [[plateau]], the Shan Plateau, which together with the higher mountains in the north and south forms the [[Shan Hills]] system. The [[gorge]] of the [[Thanlwin]] (Salween/Namhkong) River cuts across the state. [[Inle Lake]] where the leg-rowing [[Intha people]] live in floating villages, in the great [[Nyaung Shwe]] "plain", is the second largest natural expanse of water in Burma, shallow but {{convert|14|mi|km}}  long and {{convert|7|mi|km}}  wide.

The valleys and tableland are inhabited by the Shan people, who resemble the [[Thai (ethnic group)|Thai]], [[Siam people|Siam]], and [[Lao people|Lao]] people in language and customs. They are largely [[Theravada Buddhism|Buddhists]] and are mainly engaged in agriculture. Among the Shans live the [[Bamar]], [[Burmese Chinese|Han Chinese]], and [[Karen people|Karen]]s. The hills are inhabited by various peoples, notably the [[Va people|Wa]], who are numerous in the north and along the Chinese border. The Palaung people are numerous in the Northern Shan State, in the townships of [[Namkham Township|Namkham]], [[Mu Se Township|Muse]], [[Namhpaka]], [[Kutkai Township|Kutkai]], and [[Lashio Township|Lashio]] along the [[China-Myanmar border]], and in the middle of Shan State, in the townships of [[Namhsan]], [[Kyaukme Township|Kyaukme]], and [[Hsipaw Township|Hsipaw]]. Some of the Palaung people can also be found in [[Kalaw Township]] in the Southern Shan State. 

The [[Lisu people]] are numerous in the Northern Shan State, in the townships of [[Mongmit Township|Mongmit]], [[Hsipaw Township|Hsipaw]], [[Kyaukme Township|Kyaukme]], [[Namhsan]], [[Namhpaka]], [[Kutkai Township|Kutkai]], [[Namtu Township|Namtu]], [[Lashio Township|Lashio]], [[Hopang Township|Hopang]], and [[Tangyan Township|Tangyan]], as well as the [[Kokang]] region.

Educational opportunities in Myanmar are limited outside the main cities of [[Yangon]] and [[Mandalay]]. It is especially a problem in Shan State where vast areas are beyond government control. According to official statistics, only about 8% of primary school students in Shan State reach high school.<ref name=cso-edu>{{cite web | url=http://www.etrademyanmar.com/STATS/s1701.htm | title=Education statistics by level and by State and Division | access-date=9 April 2009 | publisher=Myanmar Central Statistical Organization | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710204307/http://www.etrademyanmar.com/STATS/s1701.htm | archive-date=10 July 2011 }}</ref>

[[Taunggyi University]] is the main university in the state, and until recently the only four-year university in the state. The [[State Peace and Development Council|military government]], which closed down universities and colleges in the 1990s to quell student unrest, has "upgraded" former colleges and two-year institutes. The government now requires that students attend their local universities and colleges, such as [[Lashio University]], [[Kyaingtong University]], [[Panglong University]].

==Health care==
The general state of health care in Myanmar is poor. The military government spends anywhere from 0.5 to 3% of the country's GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=108&subsecID=900003&contentID=254167 | title=PPI: Almost Half of All World Health Spending is in the United States | date=17 January 2007 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205231908/http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=108&subsecID=900003&contentID=254167 | archive-date=5 February 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2007/06/28_Burma.shtml | title=Burma junta faulted for rampant diseases | date=28 June 2007 | author=Yasmin Anwar | work=UC Berkeley News}}</ref> Although health care is nominally free, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack basic facilities and equipment.
