'''Crato''' is a city of 130,000 inhabitants on the banks of the river [[Granjeiro]] in the south of the state of [[Ceará]], in the northeast of [[Brazil]]. It was founded on June 21, 1764 by the [[Capuchin friar]] [[Carlos Maria de Ferrara]]. Originally it was a small village in which the population were principally native [[Kariri]]s, it gained official status as a city on October 17, 1817.

The Brazilian city of Crato was named in honor to [[Crato, Portugal|Crato]], a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] town which was founded in the 13th century.

The people of Crato credit their city's blossoming to a priest, Padre Cicero, who was outcast from the nearby town of Juazeiro do Norte in the late 1800s and settled in Crato with his various followers thereafter. Various images and statues of the priest can be found around Crato as a sign of appreciation for the priest.

Crato is about 550&nbsp;km from [[Fortaleza]], the capital of the state of Ceará. Its county has a surface area of approximately 1,117&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. It is at an altitude of 426m, {{Coord|07|14|03|S|39|24|34|W|}}. Its population of 110,000 makes it the sixth-largest city in Ceará. The economy is a mix of trading and agriculture; {{As of|2004|lc=on}}, a small industrial park is expanding. The region is rich in minerals, especially [[gypsum]] and [[marble]].

Crato has its Roman Catholic Diocese which has contributed to the educational system of the region with schools in the past. For the most recent data (2007) the city has 5.3 in the classification of the development index of basic education (for primary education, IDEB<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.qedu.org.br/cidade/4877-crato/ideb|title=Crato: Ideb|first=QEdu: Aprendizado em|last=foco|website=QEdu: Aprendizado em foco|access-date=Jul 17, 2020}}</ref>) - this index ranges from 0 to 10. The national average is 3.8 and that of the state of Ceará is 6.1 (the fourth place in the country).

In higher education, in addition to hosting campuses at the Federal University of Cariri (UFCA<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ufca.edu.br/|title=Universidade Federal do Cariri – UFCA|access-date=Jul 17, 2020}}</ref>) and the Federal Institute of Technological Education (IFCE<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ifce.edu.br/|title=Home — Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia do Ceará IFCE|website=ifce.edu.br|access-date=Jul 17, 2020}}</ref>), the city is home to the state institution Universidade Regional do Cariri (URCA<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.urca.br/novo/portal/|title=Universidade Regional do Cariri|website=www.urca.br|access-date=Jul 17, 2020|archive-date=July 17, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200717054310/http://www.urca.br/novo/portal/|url-status=dead}}</ref>), which has around 10,000 students. Several private higher education institutions are active in the city.

The city is surrounded by a tropical wood in the Araripe basin (Serra do Araripe) near the border of the state of [[Pernambuco]]. the climate is generally mild, with somewhat more rain than is typical of the region.

Crato is connected to the nearby city of [[Juazeiro do Norte]] by a [[commuter rail]] line called the [[Cariri Metro]] that opened in 2009–2010.
