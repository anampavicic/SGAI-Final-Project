'''Chattanooga''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|tʃ|æ|t|ə|ˈ|n|uː|ɡ|ə}} {{respell|CHAT|ə|NOO|gə}}) is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Hamilton County, Tennessee]], United States. It is located along the [[Tennessee River]], and borders [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to the south. With a population of 181,099 in 2020,<ref name="QuickFacts">{{cite web |title=QuickFacts: Chattanooga city, Tennesse, it was established on March 21, 1839. |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/chattanoogacitytennessee/POP010220 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |access-date=October 11, 2021}}</ref> it is Tennessee's [[List of municipalities in Tennessee|fourth-most populous city]] and one of the two principal cities of [[East Tennessee]], along with [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]. It anchors the [[Chattanooga metropolitan area]], Tennessee's fourth-largest [[metropolitan statistical area]],<ref name="greaterchatt.com"/> as well as a larger three-state area that includes Southeast Tennessee, Northwest Georgia, and Northeast Alabama.

Chattanooga was a crucial city during the [[American Civil War]] due to the multiple railroads that converge there.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Battle of Chattanooga {{!}} Civil War, Union Victory, Confederate Defeat {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Battle-of-Chattanooga |access-date=November 9, 2023 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> After the war, the railroads allowed for the city to grow into one of the Southeastern United States' largest heavy industrial hubs.

It is {{convert|118|mi|km}} northwest of [[Atlanta, Georgia]], {{convert|112|mi|km}} southwest of [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], {{convert|134|mi|km}} southeast of [[Nashville, Tennessee]], {{convert|102|mi|km}} east-northeast of [[Huntsville, Alabama]], and {{convert|147|mi|km}} northeast of [[Birmingham, Alabama]].

Divided by the [[Tennessee River]], Chattanooga is at the transition between the [[ridge-and-valley Appalachians]] and the [[Cumberland Plateau]], both of which are part of the larger [[Appalachian Mountains]]. Its official nickname is the "Scenic City", alluding to the surrounding mountains, ridges, and valleys. Unofficial nicknames include "River City", "Chatt", "Nooga", "Chattown", and "Gig City", the latter a reference to its claims that it has the fastest internet service in the Western Hemisphere.<ref name="Internet rivals Comcast, EPB slug it out">{{cite news|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2012/jun/24/comcast-epb-turf-warchattanooga-market/|title=Internet rivals Comcast, EPB slug it out in Chattanooga market|last=Smith|first=Ellis|date=June 24, 2012|newspaper=Chattanooga Times Free Press|access-date=June 26, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://chattanoogagig.com/|title=Chattanooga Gig: Your Gig is Here.|work=chattanoogagig.com|access-date=July 17, 2015|archive-date=April 5, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210405204527/http://chattanoogagig.com/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Chattanooga is internationally known from the 1941 hit song "[[Chattanooga Choo Choo]]" by [[Glenn Miller]] and his [[Glenn Miller Orchestra|orchestra]]. It is home to the [[University of Tennessee at Chattanooga]] (UTC) and [[Chattanooga State Community College]].

==History==
{{For timeline}}

===Early history===
The first inhabitants of the Chattanooga area were [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Sites dating back to the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period (c. [[10,000 BCE]]) show continuous human occupation through the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]], [[Woodland period|Woodland]], [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]]/[[Muscogee|Muskogean]]/[[Yuchi]] (900–[[Yuchi#History|1714]] CE), and [[Cherokee]] (1776–1838) periods. The Chickamauga Mound near the mouth of the [[Chickamauga Creek]] is the oldest ({{circa|750 [[Common Era|CE]]}}) remaining visible art in Chattanooga.<ref>{{cite web |last1=kunesh |first1=tom |title=Chickamauga Mound |url=http://www.moccasinbend.net/cita/chickamaugamound/index.html |publisher=Chattanooga InterTribal Association |access-date=March 15, 2019}}</ref>

The [[Citico (Hamilton County, Tennessee)|Citico]] town and mound site was the most significant [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]]/[[Muscogee]] landmark in Chattanooga up to 1915. The first part of the name "Chattanooga" derives from the [[Muskogean]] word ''cvto'' /chắtȯ/ – 'rock'.<ref>A Dictionary of Creek/Muskogee, Margaret McKane Mauldin</ref> The latter may be derived from a regional suffix ''-nuga'' meaning dwelling or dwelling place. It is also believed to be derived from the Creek Indian word ''Chat-to-to-noog-gee'', meaning ‘rock rising to a point’, which is speculated to be a reference to Lookout Mountain.<ref>{{cite news|last=Omarzu|first=Tim|date=May 31, 2016|title=Chattanooga may mean 'rock rising to a point' — after Lookout Mountain

The earliest Cherokee occupation of the area dates from 1776, when [[Dragging Canoe]] separated himself from the main tribe to establish resistance to European settlement during the [[Cherokee–American wars]]. In 1816 [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], who later became [[Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation|Principal Chief]], established [[Ross's Landing]]. Located along what is now Broad Street, it became one of the centers of Cherokee Nation settlement, which also extended into Georgia and Alabama.<ref name=tehc />

In 1838, the U.S. government forced the Cherokees, along with other Native Americans, to relocate to the area designated as [[Indian Territory]], in what is now the state of [[Oklahoma]]. Their journey west became known as the "[[Trail of Tears]]" for their exile and fatalities along the way. The U.S. Army used Ross's Landing as the site of one of three large internment camps, or "emigration depots", where Native Americans were held before the journey on the Trail of Tears.<ref name=vott>Vicki Rozema, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7zgcpmg8vcC&dq=trail+of+tears,+emigration+depots&pg=PA20 Voices from the Trail of Tears]. ''Voices from the Trail of Tears'', 2003. Retrieved August 19, 2009.</ref>

In 1839, the community of Ross's Landing incorporated as the city of Chattanooga. The city grew quickly, initially benefiting from a location well-suited for river commerce. With the arrival of the railroad in 1850, Chattanooga became a boom town. The city was known as the site "where cotton meets corn," referring to its location along the cultural boundary between the mountain communities of southern Appalachia and the cotton-growing states to the south.<ref name=tehc>Timothy Ezzell, [http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=226 Chattanooga].

===Civil War===
{{Main|Chattanooga in the American Civil War}}
During the [[American Civil War]], Chattanooga was a center of battle. Chattanooga served as a hub connecting fifty percent of the Confederacy's arsenals, those being located in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]], [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]], and [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]]. Chattanooga's [[Confederate railroads in the American Civil War|railroads]] were vital to the Confederacy's transportation of raw material to processing plants for producing small arms munitions.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Hughes|first=Micheal Anderson|date=1991|title=The Struggle for Chattanooga, 1862-1863|pages=10|via=ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global}}</ref> During the [[Chickamauga Campaign]], [[Union Army|Union]] artillery [[Second Battle of Chattanooga|bombarded Chattanooga]] as a diversion and occupied it on September 9, 1863. Following the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], the defeated Union Army retreated to safety in Chattanooga. On November 23, 1863, the Battles for Chattanooga began when Union forces led by [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] reinforced troops at Chattanooga and advanced to Orchard Knob against [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] troops besieging the city. The next day, the [[Battle of Lookout Mountain]] was fought, driving the Confederates off the mountain. On November 25, Grant's army routed the Confederates in the [[Battle of Missionary Ridge]]. In regard to victories won by the Union, Chattanooga marks one of three defining moments that turned the Civil War in their favor. The [[Battle of Gettysburg]] brought the streak of victories obtained by the Confederacy to an end, while the [[Siege of Vicksburg]] split the Confederacy itself in half, while Chattanooga served as the doorway to the [[Deep South]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Russo|first=Valeria A.|date=2000|title=Gateway to Civil War history: [RUN OF PAPER Edition]|journal=Patriot Ledger|via=ProQuest Central}}</ref> These battles were followed the next spring by the [[Atlanta Campaign]], beginning just over the nearby state line in Georgia and moving southeastward. After the war ended, the city became a major railroad [[transportation hub|hub]] and industrial and manufacturing center.

===1867 flood===
The [[1867 flood of Chattanooga|largest flood in Chattanooga's history]] occurred in 1867, before the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) system was created in 1933 by [[United States Congress|Congress]]. The flood crested at {{convert|58|ft}} and completely inundated the city. Since the completion of the reservoir system, the highest Chattanooga flood stage has been nearly {{convert|37|ft}}, which occurred in 1973. Without regulation, the flood would have crested at {{convert|52.4|ft}}.<ref name="tva.gov">{{cite web |url=http://www.tva.gov/river/flood/prone.htm |title=Flood-Prone Areas |access-date=February 6, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831223148/http://www.tva.gov/river/flood/prone.htm |archive-date=August 31, 2015 }} Flood-Prone Areas.

In December 1906, Chattanooga was in the national headlines in ''[[United States v. Shipp]],'' as the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]], in the only criminal trial in its history, ruled that [[Hamilton County, Tennessee|Hamilton County]] Sheriff Joseph H. Shipp had violated [[lynching of Ed Johnson|Ed Johnson]]'s civil rights when Shipp allowed a mob to enter the Hamilton County jail and [[Lynching|lynch]] Johnson on the [[Walnut Street Bridge (Chattanooga, Tennessee)|Walnut Street Bridge]].<ref>{{cite news

Chattanooga grew with the entry of the United States in the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1917; the nearest training camp was in [[Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia]].

==== Civil Rights Movement ====
The civil rights movement of Chattanooga began in 1960 when teenage students of Howard High School, inspired by activists in [[Nashville sit-ins|Nashville]] and [[Greensboro sit-ins|Greensboro]], began to organize a similar sit-in protest. Class President Paul Walker, Lehman Pierce and as many as 200 other black students organized peaceful sit-ins at four businesses along one block in downtown Chattanooga.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Arbuckle |first=Alex |date=February 19, 2017 |title=Newly uncovered photos capture the tense atmosphere outside a 1960 Tennessee sit-in |url=https://mashable.com/feature/chattanooga-sit-ins |access-date=April 24, 2023 |website=Mashable |language=en}}</ref> White youth mobs responded with agitation, inflammatory language and violence. By the third day, Mayor Rudy Olgiatti instructed the fire department to utilize water hoses on crowds becoming the first city to utilize this tactic against protesters. Three months later the city would agree to desegregate the downtown businesses.<ref>{{Cite web |title=February 1960 |url=https://chattanoogahistory.com/february1960.php |access-date=April 24, 2023 |website=SAM HALL {{!}} chattanoogahistory.com}}</ref>

Unlike many southern cities the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]] did not lead to riots in Chattanooga. Mayor Kelley and Police Commissioner Turner met with young people to defuse the situation and bought the protesters lunch. The frustrated youths voiced their complaints about racial injustice in Chattanooga, but were convinced to peacefully disperse.<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 30, 2018 |title=John Shearer: Remembering How Chattanooga Reacted In 1968 To M.L.

In late 20th and early 21st centuries, substantial private and governmental resources have been invested in transforming the city's tarnished image. In 1993, restoration of the Walnut Street Bridge was completed.

Chattanooga, like much of Tennessee, has a four-season [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''). Winter days are usually mild, but most years have at least one day (average 3.2) where the high remains at or below freezing. Snowfall is highly variable from year to year. {{convert|11|in|cm}} were recorded between January 9–10, 2011.<ref name="NCDC">{{cite web|url=https://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/tn/401656.pdf|title=Climatography of the United States No. 20: 1971–2000|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722175820/http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/tn/401656.pdf|archive-date=July 22, 2013|url-status=dead|access-date=September 19, 2010}}</ref> The average snowiest month is February which corresponds with the annual peak in [[nor'easter]] activity.

Average annual precipitation is over {{convert|52|in|mm}}. On average, November through March represents an extended relatively wet period, because of Chattanooga's frequent placement (in the winter season) in a zone of conflict between warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and cold, dry air from Canada, amplified by jet-stream energy and abundant Gulf moisture. July presents a secondary maximum in precipitation, due to frequent thunderstorm activity. Despite the mountains that surround the city, Chattanooga has been affected by tornadoes.<ref name="Weather extremes for Chattanooga">{{cite web|url=https://www.usa.com/chattanooga-tn-natural-disasters-extremes.htm|title=Chattanooga Natural Disaster and Weather Extremes for Chattanooga|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|publisher=USA.com|access-date=February 18, 2013|archive-date=February 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212030248/http://www.usa.com/chattanooga-tn-natural-disasters-extremes.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> These tornadoes include the [[2011 Super Outbreak]], which impacted the city and nearby locations, including [[Apison, Tennessee|Apison]] and Cherokee Valley in [[Catoosa County, Georgia]], where fifteen people died, eight in Apison and seven in Cherokee Valley.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.srh.noaa.gov/mrx/?n=td_hamilton_tn|title=Documented Tornadoes in Hamilton County TN|publisher=Srh.noaa.gov|access-date=April 25, 2013|archive-date=May 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512122435/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/mrx/?n=td_hamilton_tn|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Funerals for Apison tornado victims">{{cite web|url=https://www.chattanoogan.com/2011/4/29/200086/Funeral-Services-Set-For-Some-Of-Apison.aspx|title=Funeral Services Set For Some Of Apison Tornado Victims|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=April 29, 2011|publisher=Chattanoogan.com|access-date=February 18, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Memorial unveiled for victims of April 27th tornadoes">{{cite web|url=https://www.wrcbtv.com/story/19618797/memorial-honors-april-27th-tornado-victims|title=Memorial honors April 27th tornado victims|last=Barbour|first=Matt|date=September 23, 2012|publisher=WRCB.com|access-date=February 18, 2013}}</ref> An [[2020 Easter tornado outbreak#Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia/Chattanooga–Ooltewah, Tennessee|EF3 tornado]] struck southeastern portions of Chattanooga on the night of April 12, 2020, and caused significant damage and three fatalities.<ref name="wapoupdates">{{cite news|author=Matthew Cappucci|author2=Andrew Freeman|author3=Jason Samenow|title=13 Dead as Tornadoes, Storms Tear Through Southern States|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/04/13/tornado-severe-weather-east-coast/|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=April 13, 2020|access-date=April 13, 2020}}</ref>

Tourism and Hospitality has been a growing part of Chattanooga's economy, with 2014 being the first year for Hamilton County to surpass $1 billion in revenue.

Startups have been an increasing trend, due in part to [[EPB]]'s fiber optic grid.

[[Jay Weatherill]], [[South Australia]]'s Premier, visited Chattanooga in January 2012 and studied the gigabit network that was supporting critical city safety functions such as police and fire communications infrastructure, equipment and applications. He also inspected wastewater management, storm water management, traffic control and medical diagnostics applications, as well as operations of a smart lighting and camera system that allows the police to control public lighting and see what is happening in heavy crime areas. The use of broadband to carry the video and control signaling has contributed to making Chattanooga's Coolidge Park a safer place to visit.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.broadbandexpert.com/blog/high-speed-internet/broadband/south-australia-looks-at-chattanooga-for-high-speed-broadband-model/ |title=South Australia looks at Chattanooga for high speed broadband model |publisher=BroadbandExpert |date=January 9, 2012 |access-date=April 25, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623044421/http://www.broadbandexpert.com/blog/high-speed-internet/broadband/south-australia-looks-at-chattanooga-for-high-speed-broadband-model/ |archive-date=June 23, 2013 }}</ref>

==Culture and tourism==
===Attractions===
Chattanooga touts many attractions, including the [[Tennessee Aquarium]], [[cavern]]s, and new waterfront attractions along and across the [[Tennessee River]]. In the downtown area is the [[Terminal Station (Chattanooga)|Chattanooga Choo Choo]] Hotel, housed in the renovated Terminal Station. Also downtown are the [[Creative Discovery Museum]], a hands-on children's museum dedicated to science, art, and music; an [[IMAX]] 3D Theatre, and the newly expanded [[Hunter Museum of American Art]]. The [[Tennessee Riverwalk]], an approximately {{convert|13|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} trail running alongside the river, is another attraction for both tourists and residents alike.

The city operates under a charter granted by the [[Tennessee General Assembly|state legislature]] in 1852; the charter has been subsequently amended.

The city operates under a [[strong mayor]] system, which changed from a [[Mayoralty in the United States|commission]] form of government with members voted [[at-large]]. In 1987 twelve African American city residents filed a complaint, ''[[Brown v. Board of Commissioners of the City of Chattanooga]]'', alleging that the commission-style government violated their civil rights, including the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], by diluting the minority black vote.<ref name="From Commission to Mayor-Council Government">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2011/oct/13/court-case-dramatically-shifts-form-of/|title=Brown v.

The Chattanooga City Council has nine members, of whom four are [[African Americans|African American]]. The strong-mayor system began in 1991 after a 1990 citywide election that used the new court-ordered [[electoral district|district]] system.<ref name="From Commission to Mayor-Council Government" />

The city's legislative branch is represented by members from nine districts, elected from single-member districts in partisan elections. The current council members are Chip Henderson (District 1), Jenny Hill (District 2), Ken Smith (District 3), Darrin Ledford (District 4), Isiah Hester (District 5), Carol Berz (District 6), Raquetta Dotley (District 7), Marvene Noel (District 8), and Demetrus Coonrod (District 9).<ref>{{cite web |title=City Council |url=http://www.chattanooga.gov/city-council/ |website=Chattanooga.gov |publisher=City of Chattanooga |access-date=June 20, 2022}}</ref>

Chattanooga, as the county seat of [[Hamilton County, Tennessee|Hamilton County]], is home to Chattanooga's City Courts and Hamilton County's Courts.

Chattanooga is the location of the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee]]'s Southern Division, which is housed in the [[Joel W. Solomon Federal Building and United States Courthouse|Joel W. Solomon Federal Courthouse]]. The Southern Division has jurisdiction over [[Bledsoe County, Tennessee|Bledsoe]], [[Bradley County, Tennessee|Bradley]], [[Hamilton County, Tennessee|Hamilton]], [[Marion County, Tennessee|Marion]], [[McMinn County, Tennessee|McMinn]], [[Meigs County, Tennessee|Meigs]], [[Polk County, Tennessee|Polk]], [[Rhea County, Tennessee|Rhea]], and [[Sequatchie County, Tennessee|Sequatchie]] counties.

The [[Chattanooga Police Department]] dates from 1852. Starting in 1883, it hired black police officers, making Chattanooga one of the first major Southern cities to have them. But after the state legislature imposed segregation, black police officers were dropped from the force. They were hired again on a permanent basis beginning on August 11, 1948, years before other major cities in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]], such as [[Birmingham, Alabama]] and [[Jackson, Mississippi]], integrated their police departments. The first seven black officers in 1948, Thaddeus Arnold, Singer Askins, W.B. Baulridge, C.E. Black, Morris Glenn, Arthur Heard, and Thomas Patterson, were initially restricted to walking beats in black neighborhoods. In 1960, black police officers were authorized to patrol all neighborhoods and arrest white citizens.<ref name="History of the Chattanooga Police Department">{{cite web|url=http://www.chattanooga.gov/police-department/history-department/40-s|title=Chattanooga Police Department: 1940s|publisher=City of Chattanooga|access-date=August 9, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Chattanooga Police Department History">{{cite web|url=http://ngeorgia.com/tenn/chattanooga3.html|title=Chattanooga's History (Great Depression through the Present Day)|publisher=NGeorgia.com|access-date=August 9, 2012|archive-date=August 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824043605/http://www.ngeorgia.com/tenn/chattanooga3.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Hubbard">{{cite book|last=Hubbard|first=Rita L.|title=African Americans of Chattanooga: A History of Unsung Heroes|publisher=The History Press|location=Charleston, South Carolina|date=December 10, 2007|pages=77–78|chapter=Notable Place and Events that had an impact on the United States|isbn=978-1-59629-315-1|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y2oFBDdrJDMC&q=black+police+officers+in+chattanooga%2C+1883&pg=PA77|access-date=August 9, 2012}}{{Dead link|date=November 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Transportation==
Considered to be the gateway to the [[Deep South]], along with the [[Midwest]] and the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] for motorists from states such as [[Alabama]], [[Florida]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Chattanooga's extensive transportation infrastructure has evolved into an intricate system of interstates, streets, tunnels, railroad lines, bridges, and a commercial airport.

Though Chattanooga's most famous connection to the railroad industry is "[[Chattanooga Choo Choo]]", a 1941 song made famous by [[Glenn Miller & His Orchestra]], the city serves as a major [[freight]] hub with [[Norfolk Southern]] (NS) and [[CSX]] running trains on their own (and each other's) lines. The Norfolk Southern Railway's main [[classification yard]], DeButts Yard, is just east of downtown; Norfolk Southern's Shipp's Yard and CSX's Wauhatchie Yard are southwest of the city. Norfolk Southern maintains a large railroad repair shop in Chattanooga.<ref name="Major Norfolk Southern facilities">{{cite web|url=http://www.nscorp.com/nscportal/nscorp/Media/Corporate%20Profile/|title=Norfolk Southern Corporate Profile|publisher=Norfolk Southern|access-date=August 22, 2012}}</ref> The two railroad companies are among the largest individual landowners in the city (the [[United States Government|Federal Government]] is another).<ref>{{cite web|title = Chattanooga, Tennessee – Slider|url = http://enc.slider.com/Enc/Chattanooga,_Tennessee|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060820231544/http://enc.slider.com/Enc/Chattanooga%2C_Tennessee|url-status = dead|archive-date = August 20, 2006|website = enc.slider.com|access-date = October 1, 2015}}</ref>

The [[Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum]] (TVRM), the largest historic operating railroad in the [[Southern United States|South]], and the [[Chattooga and Chickamauga Railway]] also provide railroad service in Chattanooga. The headquarters of the [[National Model Railroad Association]] (NMRA) were located in Chattanooga next to the TVRM from 1982 to 2013, when the NMRA moved to [[Soddy Daisy, Tennessee|Soddy-Daisy]], a nearby suburb.<ref name="Interview with NMRA Library Director">{{cite web|url=http://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/an-interview-with-national-model-railroad-association-library-director-brent-lambert/|title=An Interview With National Model Railroad Association Library Director Brent Lambert|last=Keane|first=Maribeth|date=February 20, 2009|publisher=Collectors Weekly|access-date=June 26, 2012}}</ref> (The NMRA had moved from [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] to Chattanooga.<ref name="Interview with NMRA Library Director"/>)

Despite the high level of freight rail activity, there is no passenger rail service in the city for commuters or long-distance travelers. But the National Railroad Passenger Corporation ([[Amtrak]]) has Chattanooga on a proposed future route that would run from [[Atlanta]] to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] twice daily, with additional stops in [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta, GA]]; [[Cartersville, Georgia|Cartersville, GA]]; [[Dalton, Georgia|Dalton, GA]]; [[Bridgeport, Alabama|Bridgeport, AL]]; [[Tullahoma, Tennessee|Tullahoma, TN]]; [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro, TN]]; and the [[Nashville International Airport]].<ref name="Amtrak Atlanta to Nashville Proposal">{{cite web |title=Amtrak's Vision: Atlanta — Chattanooga — Nashville |url=https://www.amtrakconnectsus.com/maps/atlanta-chattanooga-nashville/ |website=Amtrak Connects US |access-date=March 23, 2022}}</ref>

Using the [[Association of American Railroads|AAR]] reporting marks (NS for [[Norfolk Southern]], CSXT for [[CSX Transportation]], TVRM for the [[Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum]], TNT for subsidiary Tyner Terminal Railroad, and CCKY for [[Chattooga and Chickamauga Railway]]), the rail lines passing through Chattanooga are as follows:
*CSXT – [[Western and Atlantic Railroad|Western & Atlantic Subdivision]] (Chattanooga to [[Atlanta]])
**Chattanooga Subdivision (Chattanooga to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] on former NC&StL trackage)
*NS – [[Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific]], aka the Queen and Crescent Route, (Chattanooga to [[Cincinnati]], Ohio via [[Lexington, Kentucky]])

*CCKY – formerly the [[Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia Railway|Tennessee Alabama & Georgia]] line (Chattanooga to Hedges, Georgia, abandoned since 2009)
**formerly the [[Central of Georgia Railway|Central of Georgia]] line (Chattanooga to [[Lyerly, Georgia]])

The [[Lookout Mountain Incline Railway]], often referred to as the Incline Railway by locals, serves as a tourist attraction. It is also occasionally used for commuting by Lookout Mountain residents, particularly during wintry weather when traveling up and down the mountain could be very dangerous.

Until the 1960s the [[Louisville and Nashville]] railroad ran passenger trains through [[Union Station (Chattanooga)|Union Station]] and the [[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern Railway]] ran trains through [[Chattanooga Choo-Choo Hotel|Terminal Station]]. The last train, the L&N's ''[[Georgian (train)|Georgian]]'', left Terminal Station in October 1971.

===Bridges===
Being bisected by the [[Tennessee River]], Chattanooga has seven bridges that allow people to traverse the river; five of the bridges being automobile bridges, one a rail bridge, and one a pedestrian bridge. These are the following, from west to east:
[[File:Market Street Bridge Downtown Chattanooga.JPG|right|thumb|Market Street Bridge facing the North Shore]]
* [[P.R. Olgiati Bridge]] – Named for a former mayor, [[P.R. Olgiati]], this bridge, which was dedicated in 1959, carries [[U.S. Highway 27]] from downtown towards [[Dayton, Tennessee]] and points northward.
* [[Market Street Bridge (Chattanooga)|Market Street Bridge]] – Officially called the [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]] Bridge, this bridge is a [[bascule bridge]], which is a type of [[draw bridge]]. The bridge was completed in 1917 for the large sum of $1 million for the time. Having stood for decades since its last major overhaul, the [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]] declared it unsafe in late 2004. The bridge was closed in 2005 for a long-overdue renovation and was reopened on August 4, 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marketstbridge.com/happening.html |title=Market Street Bridge Project // What's Happening |publisher=Marketstbridge.com |access-date=November 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722190038/http://www.marketstbridge.com/happening.html |archive-date=July 22, 2013 }}</ref>
* [[Walnut Street Bridge (Tennessee)|Walnut Street Bridge]] – Also known as "The Walking Bridge", it is one of the centerpieces of Chattanooga's urban renewal and is the second longest [[pedestrian bridge]] in the nation. Constructed in 1891, the bridge was declared unsafe and closed to traffic in 1978. It was on the verge of being demolished in the late 1980s when public outcry led to it being restored as a pedestrian-only span that opened in 1993.<ref name="bikekatytrail.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.bikekatytrail.com/walnutstreet.asp |title=Katy Trail Information |publisher=Bikekatytrail.com |access-date=November 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001131447/http://www.bikekatytrail.com/walnutstreet.asp |archive-date=October 1, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
