Together with [[Puerto La Cruz]], [[Lechería, Anzoátegui|Lecheria]] and [[Guanta]], Barcelona forms one of the most important urban areas of Venezuela, with a population of approximately 950,000.

==History==
[[File:Provincia Barcelona.jpg|thumb|left|235px|The old [[Barcelona Province (Venezuela)|Province of Barcelona]] before it ceased to exist in 1864]]
=== Spanish Colonization ===
Unlike Puerto La Cruz, which was mostly built in the 20th century, Barcelona has a mish-mash of historical and modern architecture from its several years of growth and development.<ref name="Venz">Krzysztof Dydynski, Charlotte Beech (1972), p.244</ref> The settlement of ''Nueva Barcelona del Cerro Santo'' ({{langx|en|New Barcelona of the Holy Mountain}}), was originally established by the Spanish conquistador [[Joan Orpí]] (a native of [[Piera]], [[Catalonia]] in Spain) in 1638.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Joan Orpí i del Pou|url=https://www.enciclopedia.cat/ec-gec-0047728.xml|url-status=live|access-date=2022-01-05|website=Gran Enciclopedia Catalana|language=ca|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190516221249/https://www.enciclopedia.cat/EC-GEC-0047728.xml |archive-date=2019-05-16 }}</ref> It was later re-founded and populated by governor Sancho Fernández de Angulo two kilometres from the original settlement, and by a small community of Catalan colonists around 1671.<ref name=Venz/> Barcelona was one of the provinces under the governmental authority of the [[New Andalusia Province]] (''Nueva Andalusía'', or New Andalusia), and referred to commonly as ''New Barcelona''. One of the remaining buildings of this period is the ''Museo de Anzoátegui'', considered the oldest building in the city.

Many of the historical areas of Barcelona centre its main plazas: Bolivar, Miranda and Boyacá. The ''Plaza Boyacá'' was the main settlement in Barcelona, and is fronted by the ''Iglesia El Carmen'' ({{langx|en|Carmelite Church}}) and the city's cathedral, the ''Catedral de San Cristobal'' ({{langx|en|Cathedral of Saint Christopher}}), built between 1748 and 1773.<ref>The cathedral suffered damages during its construction period, caused by a local earthquake; its several decades of construction reflect the original building project and repairs after this earthquake</ref> Today, the cathedral houses the embalmed remains of San Celestino in a glass reliquary in a chapel off the main nave, which dates back to 1744.<ref name=Venz/>

By 1761, the territory had been delineated by the population of Pozuelos (to the north), west to the headlands of the River Unare, east to the Guanipa plateau and south to the [[Orinoco River]].

===Venezuelan Independence===
After forced abdications of the King by Napoleon Bonaparte, the Spanish territories in the Americas began to agitate for autonomy. In Venezuela a series of Junta governments took authority in the name of the deposed King Ferdinand after 19 April 1810, that led to the formation of local juntas. A meeting was convened in the city of Barcelona to proclaim the independence of the province of Barcelona (which included both the district of Barcelona and the province of Cumana), on the 27 April. On 11 July 1810, the Supreme Junta of Caracas included [[Barcelona Province (Venezuela)|Barcelona Province]] as one of the provinces that did not recognize the authority of the Spanish government. This led to a civil conflict between those who wanted independence from the Spanish crown and many who still recognized the authority of Spain.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

The return of [[Francisco de Miranda]] to Venezuela ultimately led to the Declaration of Independence on 5 July 1811, which was quickly followed by a Civil War between those provinces who remained loyal to Spain, and the Cadiz Cortes, and those that sought complete independence. In 1811, during the [[Venezuelan Independence War]], ''La Casa Fuerte'' ({{langx|en|The House-Fort|The Strong House}}), a building near the centre of town, located on the Avenida 5 de Julio set the scene for the period. Built on the ruins of the old ''Convento de San Francisco'', to house the administrative government of the area, but turned into a fortification by Republican defenders to protect the city from the attacks of the Spanish authorities. On 17 April 1817, the house was taken and destroyed by royalist forces, who killed all 1600 people barricaded inside.<ref>The discovered bodies included women, children and wounded; its ruins stand now as a reminder of the great suffering that characterized Venezuela's War of Independence. The ruins are framed by statues of the martyred heroes Eulalia Buroz and Pedro María Freites.</ref>

After the fall of the First Republic, the royalist authorities continued to maintain the limits and structures of the province of Barcelona. But in 1821, it was integrated into the province of Guyana, and along with Cumana and Margarita, it began to function as part of the Department of the Orinoco.

Barcelona's autonomy was re-established in 1830, and became a center during a second round of Independence battles, where important men like General [[José Antonio Páez]] headquartered, or after Independence when [[Antonio Guzmán Blanco]] spent time.<ref name=Venz/>

==Geography==
Barcelona is located in the state of [[Anzoátegui State|Anzoátegui]] along the northern coast of Venezuela, near the foothills of the western cordillera region. Its northern ocean boundary is peppered with many beaches, including Isla de Plata, Conoma, Arapito, Cangrejo, Lecherias and Playa Mansa, which cater to the tourist industry or local populations. Barcelona is the gateway to the [[Mochima National Park]], an area of islands and islets that extends across the northern coast, and was designated a protected national monument.

Its hydrography is dominated by the River Neverí, which crosses the centre of town, and has been known for seasons of floodings caused excess volume. In 1972, the governor Francisco Arreaza Arreaza granted authority for the construction of cities canals to reduce these seasonal fluctuations. Similarly, the River Aragua, which also circle the settlement has been prone to flooding, most recently in 1999 in the area known as El Viñedo.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

===Climate===
Owing to its location in the dry belt of the southern Caribbean Sea, Barcelona has a [[semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|hot semi-arid climate]] with a wet season from June to September and a dry season from December to April. A strong [[rain shadow]] and jets parallel to the coast from the westerly monsoon winds during summer serves to preclude rainfall.
