'''Antofagasta''' ({{IPA|es|antofaˈɣasta|-|Es-Antofagasta.ogg}}) is a [[port city]] in northern [[Chile]], about {{convert|1100|km|mi|-2}} north of [[Santiago]].  It is the capital of [[Antofagasta Province]] and [[Antofagasta Region]].  According to the 2015 census, the [[List of cities in Chile|city]] has a population of 402,669.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.cl/ine/canales/chile_estadistico/demografia_y_vitales/demografia/pdf/cdpubaldcasjunio2005.zip|title=Cities, Towns, Villages and Hamlets|editor=National Institute of Statistics of Chile|access-date=22 June 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120050611/http://www.ine.cl/ine/canales/chile_estadistico/demografia_y_vitales/demografia/pdf/cdpubaldcasjunio2005.zip|archive-date=20 November 2006|url-status=live}}</ref>

Once claimed by [[Bolivia]] following the [[Spanish American wars of independence]], Antofagasta was captured by Chile on February 14, 1879, triggering the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–83). Chilean sovereignty was officially recognised by Bolivia under the terms of the 1904 [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship (1904)|Treaty of Peace and Friendship]].

The city of Antofagasta is closely linked to mining activity, being a port and the chief service hub for one of Chile's major mining areas. While [[silver mining|silver]] and [[saltpeter]] mining have been historically important for Antofagasta, since the mid-19th century [[copper mining]] is by far the most important mining activity for Antofagasta fueling a steady growth in the areas of construction, retail, hotel accommodations, population growth, and a remarkable skyline development until the end of the [[2000s commodities boom]] in 2013. 

Since the 2010s Antofagasta is also a service hub for [[lithium]] mining.<ref name=cabello2022>{{cite journal |last=Caballo |first=José |year=2022 |url=http://www.andeangeology.cl/index.php/revista1/article/view/V49n2-3444/html |title=Reserves, resources and lithium exploration in the salt flats of northern Chile |journal=[[Andean Geology]] |volume=49 |number=2 |pages=297–306 |access-date=July 2, 2022 |quote=The level of lithium reserves and resources identified and the encouraging expectations for exploration place Chile as a relevant player in the development of the lithium industry worldwide. }}</ref><ref name=Cambero2024>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/land-use-biodiversity/lithium-mining-is-slowly-sinking-chiles-atacama-salt-flat-study-shows-2024-08-22/ |title=Lithium mining is slowly sinking Chile's Atacama salt flat, study shows |work=Reuters |date=August 22, 2024 |first=Fabian |last=Cambero |access-date=September 25, 2024 |quote=the area [of subsidence] measures approximately 8 kms (5 miles) north to south and 5 kms (3 miles) east to west. … Chile, the world's second-largest lithium producer, extracts the lightweight metal from the Atacama salt flat, which has one of the largest lithium reserves in the world. }}</ref>

The territory of Antofagasta was included in maps of the [[Captaincy General of Chile]] in the 18th century, depending from the city of [[Copiapó]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20200219050945/http://www.geocities.ws/soberaniachile/texto.html Jaime Eyzaguirre (1967). BREVE HISTORIA DE LAS FRONTERAS DE CHILE.]</ref>

The territory was disputed between Chile and Bolivia until the signing of the [[Boundary Treaty of 1866 between Chile and Bolivia|Boundary Treaty of 1866]].

On 18 September 1866, José Santos Ossa and Francisco Puelma achieved the award of the concession of [[nitrate]] lands, following a request taken to the [[Politics of Bolivia|Bolivian government]].{{cn|date=September 2024}} The exploring of the Chilean miners found rich deposits of [[Chile saltpeter|saltpeter]] ([[nitratine]]) in the field of [[Salar del Carmen]], to the east of the present Antofagasta.

On 8 May 1872, Antofagasta was designated by the [[Bolivia|Bolivian Government]] as ''Puerto Mayor'', opening trade worldwide. Next year, on 25 January 1872, following a session led by the prefect of the [[Mejillones|Provincial Department of Mejillones]], Manuel Buitrago founded the Municipality of Antofagasta under Bolivian Law of Municipalities, which formed the body of "Municipal Agents", composed of two Germans, one Englishman and six Chileans.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

On 27 November 1873, the "Compañía de Salitres y Ferrocarril de Antofagasta" (CSFA), a Chilean mining company, signed a contract with the government of Bolivia, in which taxes were removed from mineral exploitation for 15 years. This contract was not ratified by the Congress of Bolivia, which was then analyzed negotiations with Chile.<ref name="Valdivieso">{{cite web|author=Patricio Valdivieso|title=International Relations.

[[File:Ejercito chileno en Antofagasta (1879).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Battalion No. 3 Line of the Chilean Army, formed in columns in the Plaza Colón of Antofagasta in 1879]]
In 1873,  Bolivia signed a [[Secret treaty of alliance between Peru and Bolivia of 1873|secret treaty of defensive alliance]] with Peru. This would be used as an argument 5 years later in Chile, when it unleashed the [[War of the Pacific]]. The secret alliance forbade Bolivia from signing a border treaty with Chile, without consulting with [[Peru]]. However, in 1874 Chile and Bolivia signed a border treaty, which replaced the previous [[Boundary Treaty of 1866 between Chile and Bolivia|treaty of 1866]]. One of its points was not to impose new taxes on individuals, industries and Chilean capital for 25 years.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

For Bolivia, the contract of 1873 between the government and CSFA was not yet in force, because, according to the Bolivian constitution, all contracts with the Bolivian government had to be approved by the congress.<ref name="Valdivieso"/>

According to the Bolivian version of events, the contract with the saltpeter company was incomplete so the congress, to approve the contract, decided to enforce a tax of 10 cents, which did not violate [[Boundary Treaty of 1874 between Chile and Bolivia|the treaty of 1874]], since the contract was not yet in force at that date.<ref>{{blockquote|Sole Article.

Faced with a looming conflict with Chile, Bolivia decided to claim support under the agreement signed with Peru, and the treaty became effective with the Chilean occupation of Antofagasta, on 14 February 1879.

According to the Chilean version of events, the tax of 10 cents violated the treaty of 1874 since according to this, new taxes should not have been imposed on Chilean companies operating in Bolivia.{{cn|date=April 2024}} At the breaking of the boundary treaty by Bolivia, and the cancellation of the contract of the CSFA, Chile seized Antofagasta, then in Bolivian territory, whose sovereignty had been ratified before 1866. After the war, [[Treaty of Valparaiso|a pact of truce]] was signed between Bolivia and Chile in 1884, which stated that the territory between the [[Loa River]] and parallel 23 would be under the administration of Chile, while Bolivia would be allowed access to the ports of [[Arica]] and Antofagasta.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

In 1937, the Municipality of Antofagasta made a national call for the composition of Antofagasta's anthem. Antonio Rendic, famous physician and poet of the city, and Juan Bautista Quagliotto, musician, claimed the right to compose the lyrics and music, respectively.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

In 1956, the Universidad del Norte (now the [[Catholic University of the North]]) was founded, due to support from the [[Catholic University of Valparaíso]]. On 9 October, of the same year began the negotiations for the creation of the "Centro Universitario Zona Norte" (University Center North Zone), part of the [[University of Chile]]. In 1968, the Antofagasta center of the University of Chile was inaugurated, after a university reform agreement which meant the autonomy of the ''University Center North Zone''.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

The urban area of Antofagasta begins abruptly, breaking the monotony of the [[Atacama Desert|desert]] and is located in the coastal plains, south of [[Mejillones Peninsula]] and north of "''Cerro Coloso''".

The marked aridity and [[water scarcity]] are regulated by the [[Humboldt Current]], in addition to the high humidity and morning fog known as "Camanchaca".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bluewater.cl/HCI/ |title=Humboldt Current Index (HCI) |date=August 2012 |location=Santiago |access-date=4 October 2024 }}</ref><ref name=Montecino2009>{{cite journal  |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0079661109001049 |last1=Montecino |first1=Vivian |first2=Carina B. |last2=Lange |title=The Humboldt Current System: Ecosystem components and processes, fisheries, and sediment studies |journal=Progress in Oceanography |volume=83 |number=1 |year=2009 |pages=65-79 [[doi:10.1016/j.pocean.2009.07.041]] |doi=10.1016/j.pocean.2009.07.041 |bibcode=2009PrOce..83...65M |access-date=4 October 2024 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=A Neglected Water Resource: The Camanchaca of South America |url=https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:VA6C2:64cfb0a8-939c-40c3-bb89-9bb31642e2b4 |journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society |volume=69 |number=2 |date=February 1988 |first1=Robert S. |last1=Schemenauer |first2=Humberto |last2=Fuenzalida |first3=Pilar |last3=Cereceda |pages=138–147 |doi=10.1175/1520-0477(1988)069<0138:ANWRTC>2.0.CO;2 |bibcode=1988BAMS...69..138S |quote=the camanchaca is a general phenomenon along the northern coast of Chile, its behavior is controlled by the physiography of the coast |access-date=4 October 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://chiletoday.cl/the-humboldt-current-and-why-chilean-beaches-are-the-coldest/ |title=The Humboldt Current and why Chilean beaches are the coldest |date=18 January 2019 |work=Chile Today |first=Boris |last=van der Spek |access-date=4 October 2024 }}</ref>

Furthermore, the [[South Pacific High|Pacific anticyclone]] generates winds from the south and southwest.

The average annual temperature is {{convert|16.8|°C|°F}}.<ref name= DMC /> The average daily low temperature in the warmest month, January, is {{convert|17.5|°C|°F}} while the average daily high temperature is {{convert|23.2|°C|°F}}.<ref name= DMC /> The coldest month, July, sees an average low temperature of {{convert|11.8|°C|°F}} and an average high temperature of {{convert|16.5|°C|°F}}.<ref name= DMC /> The highest temperature recorded is {{convert|30.0|°C|°F}} in January 1998 and the lowest recorded is {{convert|3.0|°C|°F}} in September 1978.<ref name= DMC />

The Atacama Desert coast is subject to a climate of extreme aridity, and therefore generates a low average annual rainfall of {{convert|3.4|mm|2|abbr=on}} (1970–2000), and the Town of Antofagasta itself receives an annual average of less than {{convert|0.1|mm|3|abbr=on}} of rainfall per year, earning it the record as the world's driest town.<ref name= DMC /> However, the sporadic occurrence of heavy rainfall, together with the geomorphologic situation of the city, make it susceptible to be affected by mud flows and landslides. Between 1916 and 1999, the city was affected by floods or landslides on seven occasions: 1925, 1930, twice in 1940, 1982, 1987 and [[1991 Antofagasta mudflows|1991]], of which the most important episodes in 1940 and 1991.

The higher transportation consists of thirteen lines of [[minibus]]es, which correspond to buses with a capacity of fewer than thirty people. The public transport is within a tender and is known as TransAntofagasta. The public transport plan took effect officially on 28 November 2005, replacing the old bus service.<ref>{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.mercurioantofagasta.cl/prontus4_noticias/site/artic/20051128/pags/20051128050132.html|title=Controversial plan TransAntofagasta debuts today|work=El Mercurio de Antofagasta|access-date=28 March 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070403080328/http://www.mercurioantofagasta.cl/prontus4_noticias/site/artic/20051128/pags/20051128050132.html| archive-date= 3 April 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> The route of these buses finish in the Caleta Coloso (south end of the city) during the year, and during the summer come as far as Balneario Juan Lopez, which is out of town.

The lower transport consists of [[taxicab|taxi]]s lines, corresponding to a black [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]]s that make their way through the urban area through fixed routes.

=== Railways ===
The most important railroad is the [[Ferrocarril de Antofagasta a Bolivia]] (FCAB) founded in 1888, during the economic boom of the saltpeter industry. In 1930, FCAB was acquired by [[Antofagasta PLC]], which is part of the Quiñenco commercial group.

Unlike other contemporary mining railways, FCAB survived the crash of the natural nitrate sector.{{cn|date=April 2024}} It provides a variety of transportation services - most notably, the transport of mining products and consumables such as [[copper cathode]]s and [[sulfuric acid]] - via a {{convert|900|km|mi|sp=us}} long rail network that is connected to the Ferrocarril Andino de Bolivia, [[Ferronor]] (Chile), and [[Ferrocarril General Manuel Belgrano|Ferrocarril Belgrano]] in [[Argentina]] ([[Salta–Antofagasta railway]]).  Its gauge is {{RailGauge|1000mm|lk=on}}.

=== Future commuter rail ===
Due to the accelerated urban and demographic growth of Antofagasta during 2000–2010, a [[commuter train]] using the current FCAB line is currently under review.  The project aims to decongest vehicle traffic by linking the north and south of the city with a direct train line.<ref>{{cite web|year=2009|url=http://www.estrellanorte.cl/prontus4_nots/site/artic/20090325/pags/20090325001238.html|title=Commuter Rail for Antofagasta|work=La Estrella del Norte|access-date=25 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927084445/http://www.estrellanorte.cl/prontus4_nots/site/artic/20090325/pags/20090325001238.html|archive-date=27 September 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>
