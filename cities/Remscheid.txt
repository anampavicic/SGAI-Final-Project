'''Remscheid''' ({{IPA|de|ˈʁɛmʃaɪt|-|De-Remscheid.ogg}}) is a [[List of cities and towns in Germany|city]] in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]]. It is, after [[Wuppertal]] and [[Solingen]], the third-largest municipality in [[Bergisches Land]], being located on the northern edge of the region, on the south side of the [[Ruhr]] area.

Remscheid had around 109,000 inhabitants in 2015. At the end of 2019 it had 113,703 inhabitants.

==Geography==
Remscheid comprises four boroughs, ''Alt-Remscheid'', ''Remscheid-Süd'', ''Lennep'', and [[Lüttringhausen]].

Its highest point is the [[Brodtberg]] (378 m).

==History==
Remscheid was founded in the 12th century, but remained a small village until the 19th century. Early spellings for the city included ''Remissgeid'' (1217), ''Rymscheyd'' (1351), ''Reymscheyd'' (1487) and ''Rembscheid'' (1639). The economic growth of the entire Rhine-Ruhr region led to an increase of the population of Remscheid. Mechanical engineering and toolmaking were the main industries practised within the town. This is carried on today with the [[Hazet]] tool company which has three factories in Remscheid. Remscheid was part of the [[Prussia]]n [[Rhine Province]] from 1822 to 1945.

On 31 July 1943, during [[World War II]], Remscheid was almost completely destroyed during a British [[area bombing|bombing raid]] which caused a [[firestorm]]. This bombing raid was the final operation of [[RAF|RAF's]] [[Battle of the Ruhr]] involving 273 aircraft. Today around one third of the city consists of buildings from before World War II.<ref>https://zensus2011.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/Aufsaetze_Archiv/2015_12_NI_GWZ_endgueltig.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4 {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2024}}</ref> During 14 and 15 April 1945, Remscheid was captured by the [[78th Infantry Division (United States)]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tothosewhoserved.org/usa/ss/usass01/chapter5.html|title = US Army SS 01 Chronology 1941–1945: 1945}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Lightning78thInfantry|title = Lightning, the History of the 78th Infantry Division|year = 1947|publisher = Washington, Infantry journal press}}</ref>
