==Demographics==
===Ethnicity===
Shahr-e Kord is populated by [[Persians]], [[Lurs]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Language distribution: Chahar Mahal va Bakhtiari Province|url=http://iranatlas.net/index.html?module=module.language-distribution.chahar_mahal_va_bakhtiari#|access-date=25 March 2021|website=Iran Atlas}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Anonby|first=Erik|title=Atlas of the Languages of Iran: A working classification|url=http://iranatlas.net/index.html?module=module.classification|access-date=27 March 2021|website=Iran Atlas}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Shahr-e Kord, at face value, seems to mean "City of the [[Kurdish people|Kurds]]". In antiquity, the place had been called "Dezh Gord" (دژگرد), where ''dezh'' (دژ) means "fortress" and ''gord'' (گرد) means "hero".{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}

After the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], the name changed to "Deh Kord" ({{langx|fa|دهكرد}}); ''dezh'' was reinterpreted as ''deh'' (ده) meaning "village" and ''gord'' became ''kord'' because the [[Arabic alphabet]] lacks the letters "g" (گ), and "zh" (ژ).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tebyan-chb.ir/Tebyan/ostan/about-ostan/ostan.aspx |title=:::سازمان تبلیغات اسلامی چهارمحال و بختیاری:::کلیات استان::: |access-date=2011-05-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324054514/http://www.tebyan-chb.ir/Tebyan/ostan/about-ostan/ostan.aspx |archive-date=2012-03-24 }}</ref> Other examples of cities whose names changed partly due to the influence of the [[Arabic language]] are [[Chamgordan]], [[Boroujerd]] and [[Dezful]], which were called Chamgord, Borougord and Dezhpol, respectively, before the Islamic conquest.

In 1935, the name was finally changed to its present form with ''deh'' being replaced with ''shahr'' (شهر) meaning "city", which better reflects the size of Shahr-e Kord.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}
On the other side, Lurs have been known as Kurds in the post Islamic conquest literature. Michael M. Gunter states that Lurs are closely related to the Kurds but that they "apparently began to be distinguished from the Kurds 1,000 years ago."<ref>Gunter, Michael M. (2011). Historical Dictionary of the Kurds (2nd ed.). Scarecrow Press. p. 203. ISBN 978-0810867512.</ref>
