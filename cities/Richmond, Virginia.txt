[[File:Portrait, William Byrd II, Sir Godfrey Kneller.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[William Byrd II]] is considered the founder of Richmond. The Byrd family, which includes [[Harry F. Byrd]], has been central to Virginia's history since its founding. ]]
After the first permanent English-speaking settlement was established at [[Jamestown, Virginia]], in April 1607, [[Christopher Newport|Captain Christopher Newport]] led explorers northwest up the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] to an inhabited area in the [[Powhatan]] Nation.<ref>{{cite web |last1=City of Richmond |title=History |url=http://www.richmondgov.com/Visitors/History.aspx |access-date=August 7, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025141830/http://www.richmondgov.com/Visitors/History.aspx |archive-date=October 25, 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
Richmond was Arrohattoc territory where Arrohateck village was located. However, as time progressed relations between the Arrohattocs and English colonists declined, and by 1609 the tribe was unwilling to trade with the settlers. As the population began to dwindle, the tribe declined and was last mentioned in a 1610 report by the visiting William Strachey. By 1611 the tribe's Henrico town was found to be deserted when Sir Thomas Dale went to use the land to found Henricus.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/tripideas/richmond-s-indigenous-heritage.htm |title=History Up Close Near Richmond, Virginia |publisher=United States National Park Service |access-date=August 13, 2024}}</ref>

In 1611, the first European settlement in Central Virginia was established at [[Henricus]], where the [[Falling Creek (James River tributary)|Falling Creek]] empties into the James River. In 1619, early [[Virginia Company]] settlers established the [[Falling Creek Ironworks]] there. [[Anglo-Powhatan Wars|Decades of conflicts]] between the Powhatan and the settlers followed, including the [[Battle of Bloody Run (1656)|Battle of Bloody Run]], fought near Richmond in 1656, after tensions arose from an influx of [[Manahoac]]s and [[Nahyssans]] from the North. Nonetheless, the James Falls area saw more White settlement in the late 1600s and early 1700s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dabney |first=Virginius | author-link=Virginius Dabney |title=Richmond: The Story of a City |year=1990 |edition=revised and expanded |isbn=978-0813912745 |publisher=[[University Press of Virginia]]}}</ref>

In early 1737, planter [[William Byrd II]] commissioned [[William Mayo (civil engineer)|Major William Mayo]] to lay out the original town grid, completed in April. Byrd named the city after the English town of [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] near (and now part of) London, because the view of the James River's bend at the fall line reminded him of his home at [[Richmond Hill, London|Richmond Hill]] on the [[River Thames]]. <ref name="Harvey2012">{{cite book |last1=Harvey |first1=Eleanor Jones |last2=Smithsonian American Art Museum |title=The Civil War and American Art |year=2012 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-18733-5 |page=162 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2CPJyvqk4CUC&pg=PA162}}</ref>In 1742, the settlement was incorporated as a town.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Scott |first1=Mary Wingfield |title=Houses of Old Richmond |date=1941 |publisher=The Valentine Museum |location=Richmond, Virginia |url=http://www.rosegill.com/ProjectWinkie/Houses%20of%20Old%20Richmond.pdf |access-date=August 7, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924092051/http://www.rosegill.com/ProjectWinkie/Houses%20of%20Old%20Richmond.pdf |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Because of the canal and the [[hydropower]] the falls generated, Richmond emerged as an important industrial center after the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783). It became home to some of the largest manufacturing facilities, including iron works and flour mills, in [[Southeastern United States|the South]] and the country.

By 1850, Richmond was connected by the [[Richmond and Petersburg Railroad]] to [[Port Walthall]], where ships carrying over 200 tons of cargo could connect to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] or [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]].

===American Civil War===
{{main| Richmond in the American Civil War}}
Five days after the Confederate attack on [[Fort Sumter]], the Virginia legislature voted to secede from the United States and join the newly created [[Confederate States of America]] on April 17, 1861. The action became official in May, after the Confederacy promised to move its national capital to Richmond from [[Montgomery, Alabama]].[[File:White House of the Confederacy - entrance, May 2013.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[White House of the Confederacy]]]]Richmond held local, state and national Confederate government offices, hospitals, a railroad hub, and one of the largest slave markets. It also had the largest Confederate arms factory, the [[Tredegar Iron Works]]. The factory produced artillery and other munitions, including heavy [[Ordnance ammunition|ordnance]] machinery and the 723 tons of armor plating that covered the [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']], the world's first [[ironclad]] ship used in war.<ref name="Tredegar">Time-Life Books.

Located about {{cvt|100|mi|km}} from the national capital in [[Washington, D.C.]], Richmond was at the end of a long supply line and difficult to defend. For four years, its defense required the bulk of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] and the Confederacy's best troops and commanders.<ref>Bruce Levine, ''The Fall of the House of Dixie'' (New York, Random House 2014) pp. 269–70</ref> The Union army made Richmond a main target in the campaigns of 1862 and 1864–65. In late June and early July 1862, Union General-in-Chief [[George B. McClellan]] threatened but failed to take Richmond in the [[Seven Days Battles]] of the [[Peninsula campaign]]. Three years later, Richmond became indefensible in March 1865 after nearby [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]] fell and several remaining rail supply lines to the south and southwest were broken.[[File:Robert E. Lee, 1865 (edit).jpg|thumb|[[Robert E. Lee]] at [[Stewart–Lee House|his home]] in Richmond (1865)]]On March 25, Confederate General [[John B. Gordon]]'s desperate attack on [[Battle of Fort Stedman|Fort Stedman]], east of Petersburg, failed. On April 1, Union Cavalry General [[Philip Sheridan]], assigned to interdict the Southside Railroad, met brigades commanded by Southern General [[George Pickett]] at the [[Battle of Five Forks|Five Forks]] Junction, defeated them, took thousands of prisoners, and advised Union General-in-Chief [[Ulysses S. Grant]] to order a general advance. When the Union Sixth Corps broke through Confederate lines on the Boydton Plank Road south of Petersburg, Confederate casualties exceeded 5,000, about a tenth of Lee's defending army. Lee then informed President [[Jefferson Davis]] that he intended to evacuate Richmond.<ref>Levine pp. 271–72</ref>

On April 2, 1865, the Confederate Army began Richmond's evacuation. Confederate President Davis and his cabinet, Confederate government archives, and its treasury's gold, left the city that night by train. Confederate officials burned documents and troops burned tobacco and other warehouses to deny the Union any spoils. In the early morning of April 3, Confederate troops exploded the city's gunpowder magazine, killing several paupers in a temporary Almshouse and a man on 2nd St. The concussion shattered windows all over the city.<ref>"The City Magazine" The Richmond Whig, 4/27/1865</ref> Later that day, General [[Godfrey Weitzel]], commander of the 25th Corps of the [[United States Colored Troops]], accepted Richmond's surrender from the mayor and a group of leading citizens who did not evacuate.<ref>Levine, pp. 272–73</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=August 4, 2001 |others=Regimental Losses in the American Civil War William F.

While Davis attempted to organize the Confederate government in [[Danville, Virginia|Danville]], Lincoln met Confederate Assistant Secretary of War [[John Archibald Campbell|John A. Campbell]], handing him a note inviting Virginia's state legislature to end their rebellion. After Campbell spun the note to Confederate legislators as a possible end to the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], Lincoln rescinded his offer and ordered General Weitzel to prevent the state legislature from meeting.

On April 6, Union forces killed, wounded, or captured 8,000 Confederate troops at [[Battle of Sayler's Creek|Sayler's Creek]], southwest of Petersburg. The Confederate Army continued a general retreat southwestward, and General Lee continued to reject General Grant's surrender entreaties until Sheridan's infantry and cavalry encircled the shrinking [[Army of Northern Virginia]] and cut off its ability to retreat further on April 8. Lee surrendered his remaining approximately 10,000 troops the following morning at [[Appomattox Court House, Virginia|Appomattox Court House]], meeting Grant at the McLean Home.<ref>Levine pp. 275–78</ref>

Richmond's East End includes neighborhoods like the rapidly gentrifying [[Church Hill, Richmond, Virginia|Church Hill]], home to [[St. John's Episcopal Church, Richmond, Virginia|St. John's Church]], poorer areas like [[Fulton Hill|Fulton]], Union Hill, and Fairmont, and public housing projects like [[Mosby Court]], Whitcomb Court, Fairfield Court, and Creighton Court closer to [[Interstate 64]].<ref name="neighborhoods">{{cite web |url=http://www.richmondgov.com/departments/presssecretary/neighborhoodguide/ |title=Neighborhood Guide |publisher=City of Richmond |date=September 27, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927031940/http://www.richmondgov.com/departments/presssecretary/neighborhoodguide/ |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The area between Belvidere Street, [[Interstate 195 (Virginia)|Interstate 195]], [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|Interstate 95]], and the river, which includes [[Virginia Commonwealth University]], is socioeconomically and architecturally diverse. North of Broad Street, the Carver and Newtowne West neighborhoods are demographically similar to neighboring [[Jackson Ward]].Carver has seen some gentrification due to its proximity to VCU. The affluent area between the [[Boulevard (Richmond, Virginia)|Boulevard]], Main Street, Broad Street, and VCU, known as the [[Fan district|Fan]], is home to [[Monument Avenue]], an outstanding collection of [[Victorian architecture]], and many students. West of the Boulevard is the Museum District, which contains the [[Virginia Historical Society]] and the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]]. South of the [[Downtown Expressway]] are [[Byrd Park]], [[Maymont]], [[Hollywood Cemetery (Richmond, Virginia)|Hollywood Cemetery]], the predominantly black working-class Randolph neighborhood, and white working-class [[Oregon Hill]]. Cary Street between Interstate 195 and the [[Boulevard (Richmond, Virginia)|Boulevard]] is a popular commercial area called [[Carytown, Richmond, Virginia|Carytown]].<ref name="neighborhoods"/>

Richmond's Northside is home to numerous listed historic districts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/tax_credits/Historic_District_Maps/RichmondNorth_20120926.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=November 15, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228211757/http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/tax_credits/Historic_District_Maps/RichmondNorth_20120926.pdf |archive-date=December 28, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Neighborhoods such as [[Chestnut Hill-Plateau Historic District (Richmond, VA)|Chestnut Hill-Plateau]] and Barton Heights began to be developed at the end of the 19th century when the new streetcar system made it possible for people to live on the city's outskirts and commute downtown. Other prominent Northside neighborhoods include Azalea, Barton Heights, Bellevue, Chamberlayne, Ginter Park, Highland Park, and Rosedale.<ref name="neighborhoods"/>

Farther west is the affluent, suburban [[The West End (Richmond, Virginia)|West End]]. Windsor Farms is among its best-known sections. The West End also includes middle- to low-income neighborhoods, such as Laurel, Farmington, and the areas around the Regency Mall. More affluent areas include Glen Allen, Short Pump, and the areas of Tuckahoe away from Regency Mall, all north and northwest of the city. The [[University of Richmond]] and the [[Country Club of Virginia]] are located on this side of town near the Richmond-Henrico border.<ref name="neighborhoods"/>

The portion of the city south of the James River is known as the Southside. Southside neighborhoods range from the affluent and middle-class suburban Westover Hills, Forest Hill, Southampton, Stratford Hills, Oxford, Huguenot Hills, Hobby Hill, and Woodland Heights to the impoverished [[Manchester, Virginia|Manchester]] and Blackwell areas, the Hillside Court housing projects, and the ailing Jefferson Davis Highway commercial corridor. Other Southside neighborhoods include Fawnbrook, Broad Rock, Cherry Gardens, Cullenwood, and Beaufont Hills. Much of Southside developed a suburban character as part of [[Chesterfield County, Virginia|Chesterfield County]] before being annexed by Richmond, most notably in 1970.<ref name="neighborhoods"/>

[[File:Monthly Climate Normals (1991-2020) - Richmond Area, VA(ThreadEx).svg|thumb|right|Climate chart for Richmond]]

[[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is rather uniformly distributed throughout the year. Dry periods lasting several weeks sometimes occur, especially in autumn, when long periods of pleasant, mild weather are most common. There is considerable variability in total monthly precipitation amounts from year to year, so no one month can be depended to be normal. Snow has been recorded during seven of the 12 months. Falls of {{cvt|4|in|cm}} or more within 24 hours occur once a year on average.<ref name="NWS Wakefield, VA (AKQ)1" /> Annual snowfall is usually moderate, averaging {{cvt|10.5|in|cm}} per season.<ref name="NWS Wakefield, VA (AKQ)1" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.weather.gov/media/akq/climateRECORDS/RIC_Climate_Records.pdf |title=Richmond VA Daily Climate Data |publisher=United States National Weather Service |access-date=April 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403202403/https://www.weather.gov/media/akq/climateRECORDS/RIC_Climate_Records.pdf |archive-date=April 3, 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Snow typically remains on the ground for only one or two days, but it remained for 16 days in 2010 (January 30 to February 14). Ice storms (freezing rain or glaze) are not uncommon, but they are seldom severe enough to cause considerable damage.

The [[James River]] reaches tidewater at Richmond, where flooding may occur in any month of the year, most frequently in March and least in July. [[Hurricanes]] and [[tropical storms]] have been responsible for most flooding during the summer and early fall months. Hurricanes passing near Richmond have produced record rainfalls. In 1955, three hurricanes, including [[Hurricane Connie]] and [[Hurricane Diane]], which brought heavy rains five days apart, produced record rainfall in a six-week period. In 2004, the downtown area suffered extensive flood damage after the remnants of [[Hurricane Gaston (2004)|Hurricane Gaston]] dumped up to {{cvt|12|in|mm|sigfig=2}} of rain.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna5851220 |title=Flooding devastates historic Richmond, Va. |work=[[NBC News]] |agency=Associated Press |date=September 1, 2004 |access-date=August 13, 2024}}</ref>

Damaging storms occur mainly from snow and [[freezing rain]] in winter, and from hurricanes, tornadoes, and severe thunderstorms in other seasons. Damage can come from wind, flooding, rain, or a combination of the three. [[Tornadoes]] are infrequent, but some notable ones have been observed in the Richmond area.

Downtown Richmond averages 84 days of nighttime frost annually. Nighttime frost is more common in areas north and west of Downtown and less common south and east of downtown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/online/ccd/min32temp.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011217185325/http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/online/ccd/min32temp.html |archive-date=2001-12-17 |title=Mean Number of Days With Minimum Temperature 32 Degrees F or Less |date=December 17, 2001}}</ref> From 1981 to 2010, the average first temperature at or below freezing was on October 30 and the average last one on April 10.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.almanac.com/gardening/frostdates/VA/Richmond |title=Frost Dates for Richmond, VA |first=Old Farmer's |last=Almanac |website=Old Farmer's Almanac |access-date=February 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190201065415/https://www.almanac.com/gardening/frostdates/VA/Richmond |archive-date=February 1, 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Murals====
With the Richmond Mural Project (RMP), sponsored by RVA Mag and Art Whino, and 2013's RVA Street Art Festival, the city quickly gained more than 100 murals created by international mural artists, such as Aryz, Roa, [[Ron English]], and Natalia Rak. While the RMP focused on international talent, the RVA Street Art Festival, led by long-time local mural artist Ed Trask, focused mainly on regional artists, although it was responsible for PoseMSK, Jeff Soto, and [[Mark Jenkins (artist)|Mark Jenkins]]. After some criticism, the RMP included its first local artist, Nils Westergard, who already was on the international circuit, and then another, Jacob Eveland. The two festivals were unrelated, and the RMP is now defunct. The RVA Street Art Festival occurs as funding permits. In response to the [[George Floyd]] protests of the summer of 2020, local artist Hamilton Glass spearheaded the Mending Walls Project, featuring walls by pairs of local artists.<ref name=Mending>{{cite web |url=https://www.vpm.org/2020-08-07/mending-walls-rva-telling-history-and-engaging-difficult-conversations-through-art |last=Gau |first=Terry Menefee |date=August 7, 2020 |title=Mending Walls RVA {{endash}} Telling history and engaging difficult conversations through art |website=vpm.org |publisher=National Public Radio |access-date=February 7, 2024}}</ref>

====Professional performing companies====
From their earliest days, Virginia and Richmond welcomed live theatrical performances. [[Lewis Hallam]] staged early Shakespeare productions in Williamsburg, and Richmond became a prominent colonial and early 19th century performance place for celebrated American and English actors, like William Macready, Edwin Forrest,<ref>Macready, William, ''The diaries of William Charles Macready, 1833–1851, Volume 2'', p. 416</ref> and the Booth family. In the 20th century, Richmond had many amateur troupes and regular touring professional productions. The city's principal performing arts groups include the [[Virginia Repertory Theatre]], [[Richmond Ballet]], [[Richmond Triangle Players]], [[Richmond Symphony]], and [[Virginia Opera]]. 

Other venues and companies include:
* [[Altria Theater]], the city-owned [[opera house]]
* The [[Byrd Theatre]] in [[Carytown, Richmond, Virginia|Carytown]], a 1920s [[movie palace]] that features second-run movies and hosts the [[French Film Festival]]
* Leslie Cheek Theater at the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]]
* Dogwood Dell, an amphitheater in [[Byrd Park]]
* [[National Theater (Richmond, Virginia)|National Theater]] 
* [[Richmond CenterStage|Dominion Energy Center]], which includes the Carpenter Theater
* [[School of the Performing Arts in the Richmond Community]]
* [[Virginia Credit Union Live!]]

Commercial art galleries include Metro Space Gallery and [[Gallery 5]] in a newly designated arts district. Not-for-profit galleries include Visual Arts Center of Richmond, 1708 Gallery, and Artspace.

In 2008, a new {{cvt|47000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Gay Community Center opened on the city's north side. It hosts meetings of many kinds and includes a large art gallery space.

===Literary arts===
Richmond has long been a hub for literature and writers. [[Edgar Allan Poe]] grew up in the city, and the city's oldest stone house is a museum to his life and works.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.poemuseum.org/ |title=Edgar Allan Poe Museum : Poe's life, legacy, and Works : Richmond, Virginia |website=www.poemuseum.org |access-date=August 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219123629/http://www.poemuseum.org/ |archive-date=December 19, 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[The Southern Literary Messenger]]'', which included his writing, is one of many notable publications started in Richmond.

<!--this image was deliberately chosen over more "greener" ones as the architectural aspects(the subject of the this section), are better portrayed -->
[[File:Egyptian Building.JPG|thumb|The [[Egyptian Building]] (1845) on the campus of [[Virginia Commonwealth University]]]]

Richmond is home to many significant structures, including some designed by notable architects. The city contains diverse styles and has excellent examples of Georgian, Federal, Greek Revival, Neoclassical, Egyptian Revival, Romanesque Revival, Gothic Revival, Tudor Revival, Italianate, Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, Art Deco, Modernist, International, and Postmodern architecture.

Many of Richmond's historic properties are documented in books and 1970s-era black and white photographs by [[John G. Zehmer]], an architectural historian and preservationist.

The 1865 Evacuation Fire destroyed about 25% of Richmond's early buildings.<ref>Hansen, Harry. "The Civil War: A History." Published 2002, Signet Classic. {{ISBN|978-0-451-52849-0}}</ref> Fewer remain due to redevelopment and construction occurring since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Nonetheless, Richmond has many historically significant buildings and districts. From the colonial period, there are the [[Patteson-Schutte House]] and the [[Edgar Allan Poe Museum (Richmond, Virginia)]], both built before 1750.

Architectural classicism is represented in all city districts, particularly Downtown and in the Fan and the Museum District. Several notable classical architects have designed buildings in Richmond. [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Charles-Louis Clérisseau]] designed the Virginia State Capitol in 1785. It is the second-oldest U.S. statehouse in continuous use (Maryland's is the oldest), and the first U.S. government building built in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] style, setting the trend for other state houses and federal buildings, including the [[White House]] and [[United States Capitol|The Capitol]] in Washington, D.C.<ref name="jefferson_capital">"[http://www.lva.virginia.gov/exhibits/capitol/ Jefferson & The Capital Of Virginia] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115150112/http://www.lva.virginia.gov/exhibits/capitol/ |date=January 15, 2010 }}." An Exhibition at the [[Library of Virginia]]; January 7&nbsp;– June 15, 2002. Retrieved on January 20, 2010.</ref> Robert Mills designed [[Monumental Church]] on Broad Street, abutted by the 1845 [[Egyptian Building]], one of the few [[Egyptian Revival]] buildings in the U.S.

[[File:Science Museum - Broad Street Station (2256100684).jpg|thumb|The [[Science Museum of Virginia]] is housed in [[Broad Street Station (Richmond)|Broad Street Station]], designed by [[John Russell Pope]]]]

The firm of [[John Russell Pope]] designed [[Broad Street Station (Richmond)|Broad Street Station]], or Union Station, in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style, and it now is home to the [[Science Museum of Virginia]]. The firm also designed [[Branch House]] on [[Monument Avenue]] as a Tudor private residence, which now is the Branch Museum of Architecture and Design. Wilson, Harris, and Richards designed [[Main Street Station (Richmond)|Main Street Station]], now used for its intended purpose. The classically trained Beaux-Arts architects, Carrère and Hastings, designed both the Jefferson Hotel and the Commonwealth Club. [[Ralph Adams Cram]], renowned for the Princeton University Chapel and the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, designed many buildings at the [[University of Richmond]], including Jeter and Ryland Halls. 

Richmond's position as a center of iron production helped to fuel the popularity of its [[cast-iron architecture]]. The city is home to a unique collection of cast iron porches, balconies, fences, and finials, second only to [[New Orleans]] in cast-iron concentration. At the height of production in the 1890s, 25 foundries operated in Richmond, employing nearly 3,500 metal workers. This number is seven times the number of general construction workers employed at the time, illustrating the importance of iron exports to the city.<ref>Robert P. Winthrop, Cast and Wrought: The Architectural Metalwork of Richmond, Virginia, (Richmond, Virginia: Valentine Museum, 1980), 93.</ref> Porches and fences in urban neighborhoods, such as Jackson Ward, Church Hill, and Monroe Ward, are particularly elaborate, often featuring ornate iron casts never replicated outside of Richmond. In some cases, casts were made for a single residential or commercial application.

Another unique architectural feature to Richmond is outdoor lighting. Former mayor [[Dwight Clinton Jones|Dwight C. Jones]] called the city the tacky light capital of the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tacky holiday lights |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/tacky-holiday-lights/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211221222117/https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/tacky-holiday-lights/ |archive-date=December 21, 2021 |access-date=2021-12-21 |website=CBS News |date=December 18, 2011 |language=en-US}}</ref>

Richmond is home to several notable buildings designed by modernist masters. [[Minoru Yamasaki]] designed the Federal Reserve Building, which dominates the downtown skyline. The [[architectural firm]] of [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]], home to [[Gordon Bunshaft]], designed the [[Library of Virginia]] and the General Assembly Offices at the Eighth and Main Building. [[Philip Johnson]] designed the [[WRVA Building]]. [[Richard Neutra]] designed [[Rice House (Richmond, Virginia)|Rice House]], a residence on a private James River Island, is Richmond's only true International Style home. Famed early modern architect and member of the [[Harvard Five]],<ref>"The Harvard Five in New Canaan", William D. Earls AIA, W. W Norton and Co., 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-393-73183-5}}</ref> [[Landis Gores]], designed the W.G. Harris residence in Richmond. [[Steven Holl]] designed the VCU [[Institute for Contemporary Art, Richmond|Institute for Contemporary Art]], opened in 2018. Other notable architects to have worked in the Richmond area include Rick Mather and [[I.M. Pei]]. 

Richmond's urban residential neighborhoods, largely single use town homes with mixed full retail/dining establishments, are keys the city's character. The Fan, the Museum District, Jackson Ward, Carver, Carytown, Oregon Hill, and Church Hill are districts anchored by large streets, such as Franklin Street, Cary Street, the Boulevard, and Monument Avenue. The city's recent population growth mainly has been concentrated in these areas.

==Parks and recreation==
[[File:botanicalgarden.jpg|thumb|[[Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden]]]]

The city operates one of the country's oldest municipal park systems. In 1851, the City Council voted to acquire {{cvt|7.5|acre|m2}}, now known as [[Monroe Park]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Woodson |first1=Charles |title=An Unfortunate Addition to Richmond's Monroe Park |url=https://www.tclf.org/unfortunate-addition-richmonds-monroe-park |website=The Cultural Landscape Foundtaion |access-date=January 22, 2023 |date=July 13, 2018}}</ref> Monroe Park is adjacent to the [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] campus, and is one of over 40 parks totaling more than {{cvt|1500|acre|ha}}.

Several parks are along the James River, and the James River Parks System offers bike trails, hiking and nature trails, and many scenic overlooks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.trailforks.com/region/james-river-park-system/ |title=James River Park System Mountain Biking Trails |website=Trailforks | access-date=August 26, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922002242/https://www.trailforks.com/region/james-river-park-system/ | archive-date=September 22, 2017 | url-status=dead}}</ref> The trails are used for the Xterra East Championship running and mountain biking courses of the off-road triathlon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.richmond.com/news/collection_3ecf827a-1206-11e5-a0d2-5fdcb6ba3682.html |title=XTERRA East Championship |author=Richmond Times-Dispatch |date=June 13, 2015 |access-date=November 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923213653/http://www.richmond.com/news/collection_3ecf827a-1206-11e5-a0d2-5fdcb6ba3682.html |archive-date=September 23, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Parks exist on two major islands in the James River, [[Belle Isle (Virginia)|Belle Isle]] and [[Brown's Island]]. Belle Isle, a former Powhatan fishing village, colonial-era horse race track, and Civil War prison camp, is the larger of the two. It contains many bike trails and a small cliff used for [[rock climbing]] instruction. The island still has many remnants of the Civil War prison camp, including an arms storage room and a gun emplacement used to quell prisoner riots. Brown's Island is smaller and a popular venue for many spring and summer free outdoor concerts and festivals, such as the weekly Friday Cheers concert series and the James River Beer and Seafood Festival.

[[File:MaymontPark JapaneseGarden.jpg|thumb|Japanese Garden at [[Maymont]]]]

Two other major city parks along the river are [[Byrd Park]] and [[Maymont]], located near the Fan District. Byrd Park features a {{cvt|1|mi|spell=in|adj=on}} running track, with exercise stops, a public [[dog park]], and a number of small lakes for small boats, as well as two monuments, Buddha house and an amphitheater. The [[Carillon|World War I Memorial Carillon]], built in 1926, features prominently in the park. Maymont, adjacent to Byrd Park, is a {{cvt|100|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] estate with a museum, formal gardens, native wildlife exhibits, nature center, [[carriage]] collection, and [[Children's Farm|children's farm]]. Other city parks include [[Joseph Bryan Park Azalea Garden]], Forest Hill Park (former site of the Forest Hill Amusement Park), and [[Chimborazo Park]] (site of the National Battlefield Headquarters).

The James River through Richmond is one of the best urban white-water rafting/canoeing/kayaking sites in the country, and several rafting companies provide related services. The city also has several easily accessed riverside areas for rock-hopping, swimming, and picnicking.

[[Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden]] is in adjacent Henrico County. Founded in 1984, Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden is {{cvt|80|acre|m2}}, one of only two independent public botanical gardens in Virginia, and designated a state botanical garden.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden Factsheet |url=http://www.lewisginter.org/about/documents/GardenFactsheetAugust2008.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012171750/http://www.lewisginter.org/about/documents/GardenFactsheetAugust2008.pdf |archive-date=October 12, 2011 |access-date=November 1, 2011}}</ref> A public place for the display and scientific study of plants, it features a glass conservatory, rose garden, healing garden, and accessible-to-all children's garden. 

Several [[theme park]]s are located near the city, including [[Kings Dominion]] to the north, and [[Busch Gardens]] to the east, near [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]].

Richmond city government consists of a [[city council]] with representatives from nine districts serving in a [[legislative]] and oversight capacity, as well as a popularly elected, at-large mayor serving as head of the [[executive branch]]. Citizens in each of the nine districts elect one council representative each to serve a four-year term. Beginning with the November 2008 election Council terms was lengthened to four years. The city council elects from among its members one member to serve as Council President and one to serve as Council Vice President. The city council meets at City Hall, located at 900 E. Broad St., 2nd Floor, on the second and fourth Mondays of every month, except August.

In 1977, a federal district court ruled in favor of [[Curtis Holt Jr.]] who had claimed the council's existing election process&nbsp;— an at large voting system&nbsp;— was racially biased. The verdict required the city to rebuild its council into nine distinct wards. Within the year the city council switched from majority white to majority black, reflecting the city's populace. This new city council elected Richmond's first black mayor, [[Henry L. Marsh]].

Richmond's government changed in 2004 from a [[council-manager]] form of government with a mayor elected by and from the council to an at-large, popularly elected mayor. Unlike most major cities, in order to be elected, a mayoral candidate must win a plurality of the vote in five of the city's nine council districts. If no one crosses that threshold, a runoff is held between the two top finishers in the first round. This was implemented as a compromise in order to address concerns that better-organized and wealthier white voters could have undue influence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://electls.blogs.wm.edu/2017/02/15/nine-districts-how-richmond-came-to-possess-one-of-americas-strangest-rules-for-electing-a-mayor/ |title=Nine Districts: How Richmond came to possess one of America's strangest rules for electing a Mayor |author1=Venugopal Katta |publisher=[[College of William and Mary]] |date=February 15, 2017 |access-date=May 10, 2020 |archive-date=May 5, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200505045722/http://electls.blogs.wm.edu/2017/02/15/nine-districts-how-richmond-came-to-possess-one-of-americas-strangest-rules-for-electing-a-mayor/ |url-status=live }}</ref>  In a landslide election, incumbent mayor Rudy McCollum was defeated by [[Douglas Wilder|L.
