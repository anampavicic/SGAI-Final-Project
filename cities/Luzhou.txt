'''Luzhou''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|泸|州}} |t=瀘州 |p=Lúzhōu}}; [[Sichuanese Pinyin]]: Nu<sup>2</sup>zou<sup>1</sup>; [[Minjiang dialect|Luzhou dialect]]: {{IPA-xx|nu˨˩tsəu˥|}}), formerly transliterated as '''Lu-chou''' or '''Luchow''', is a [[prefecture-level city]] located in the southeast of [[Sichuan]] Province, China. It is also known as the "Liquor City" ({{lang|zh-hans|酒城}}). It was named '''Jiangyang''' ({{Zh|s=江阳|t=江陽|p=Jiāngyáng}}) until the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]]. Situated at the confluence of the [[Tuo River]] and the [[Yangtze River]], Luzhou has been Sichuan province's largest port in both size and output since [[Chongqing|Chongqing's]] separation from Sichuan in 1997. 
As of the [[2020 Chinese census]], its population was 4,254,149. Of these, 1,241,273 lived in the built-up (''or metro'') area made of [[Jiangyang, Luzhou|Jiangyang]] and [[Longmatan, Luzhou|Longmatan]] districts, as [[Naxi, Luzhou|Naxi]] district is not conurbated yet.
Luzhou borders [[Yunnan]], [[Guizhou]] and [[Chongqing]] provinces. As the only geographic junction of the four provinces, it was an important port location in ancient China. After the PRC was founded in 1949, Luzhou became the capital of southern Sichuan province. In 1983, Luzhou was upgraded to [[prefecture-level city]] status.

Luzhou is best known for its [[alcoholic beverage]]s, particularly [[baijiu]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://art-bin.com/art/aluzhoueng.html|title = The Liquor from Luzhou}}</ref>

==History==
Luzhou was incorporated into the [[Ba (state)|Ba state]] early in the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] period, in the 11th century BC. In 316 BC, during the [[Warring States period]], [[King Huiwen of Qin]] established Ba prefecture, which included most of Luzhou, after he conquered the states of [[Ba (state)|Ba]] and [[Shu (state)|Shu]]. The local economy and culture expanded as a result of the advanced production technique and culture introduced by immigrants from the rest of China.
During the [[Western Han dynasty]] (206 BC-AD 9), Jiangyang county was set up in what is the current Jiangyang district, at the confluence of the [[Tuo River]] and [[Yangtze River]]. The county was further expanded during the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]]. As a result, Luzhou became the portal of the Tuojing River leading to western Sichuan, which brought great prosperity to salt-refinery and agriculture in the area.

The [[Song dynasty]] was an important period in Luzhou's history. It was known as the natural granary of southern Sichuan as the liquor-distilling and salt-refining industries expanded. The method to [[decoct]] salt with natural gas was discovered at that time, according to ancient literature<!-- which? -->. In addition, trade and business between Luzhou residents and ethnic groups was brisk and a protective wall as well as forts were constructed by the local government.

In the [[Yuan dynasty]], Luzhou remained an important place for trade, especially the liquor-distillation, salt-refinery and tea-making industries. A large number of wooden ships were constructed to further the shipping industry.

During the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1911), waves of immigrants from other parts of China brought rapid growth in economy and culture. Luzhou served as a political, economic, military and cultural center for the provinces of [[Sichuan]], [[Guizhou]] and [[Yunnan]].

On December 6, 1949, two months after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the [[People's Liberation Army]] took control of Luzhou from the [[Kuomintang]] government. In 1960, Luzhou prefecture was created with five counties that had been part of [[Yibin]] prefecture. The prefecture was upgraded to the [[prefecture-level city]] of Luzhou in 1983. Nowadays, Luzhou is considered a center of the chemical, machinery, and liquor-distilling industries.
