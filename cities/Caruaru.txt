'''Caruaru''' is a Brazilian [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] in the [[States of Brazil|state]] of [[Pernambuco]]. The most populous city in the interior of the state, Caruaru is located in the microzone of [[Agreste]] and because of its cultural importance, it is nicknamed ''Capital do Agreste'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for the "capital city of the Agreste region"), ''Princesinha do Agreste'' ("Little Princess of Agreste"), and ''Capital of agreste'' ("the capital city of ''[[forró]]''").

The city is located {{convert|140|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} from the state capital of [[Recife]], which has an [[Recife/Guararapes–Gilberto Freyre International Airport|international airport]]. However, Caruaru has its own [[Caruaru Airport|airport]]. Caruaru is renowned for its extensive ''[[Festa Junina|Festival de São João]]'' ("Saint John's Festival"), which takes up the whole month of June, sometimes extending into July. Caruaru had a 2024 resident population of 402,290&nbsp;inhabitants, living in a land area of {{convert|920.61|km2|mi2|abbr=off|sp=us}}.

Caruaru is the hometown, among others, of Álvaro Lins, Brazilian journalist, and Lieutenant Brigadier Reginaldo dos Santos, former dean of the [[Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica|Brazilian Technological Institute for Aeronautics]].

==History==

[[File:Caruaru-Câmara-Municipal.jpg|thumb|left|[[Municipal Chamber of Caruaru]], the local [[legislature]].]]
The lands that today comprise the city of Caruaru were originally a cattle ranch owned by family Nunes dos Bezerros. This name was given because of the proximity of the farm to the Bezerros chapel. Some orphans used to live with the Nunes family. One of them, José Rodrigues de Jesus, inherited part of the estate, staying at the location that would later be named Caruaru.
There he built a chapel dedicated to the [[Immaculate Conception]]. A village started to grow around this chapel. In 1846, Friar Euzébio de Sales started to build the parish named ''Igreja Matriz'', nowadays a cathedral. In later years, the church was rebuilt twice, the last one in 1883. The geographical position benefited the city, because it was a necessary stopover in the transportation of cattle to the interior of the state.
