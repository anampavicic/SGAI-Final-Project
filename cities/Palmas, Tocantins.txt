According to [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] estimates from 2024, the city has 323,625 inhabitants and an area that covers 2,218.93 square kilometers (856.73 sq mi).

Palmas was founded in 1990 and developed [[Planned community|from the ground up]] in a former agricultural area as the capital of the new state of Tocantins, formed under the 1988 constitution.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Rego|first=Renato Leão|date=2020|title=Palmas, the last capital city planned in twentieth-century Brazil|journal=Urbe. Revista Brasileira de Gestão Urbana|volume=12|doi=10.1590/2175-3369.012.e20190168|issn=2175-3369|doi-access=free}}</ref> It was intended to develop a relatively undeveloped area of the nation to provide better jobs for people. The city has a well-designed road system, and its urban zoning is modeled on that of [[Brasília]], the national capital. A symmetrical park lies at the city centre, and a large central avenue similar to [[Monumental Axis|Brasília's]] extends north to south.<ref name=":0" /> The city is home to the [[Federal University of Tocantins]].

In 2002, the {{Interlanguage link|Usina_Hidrelétrica_Luiz_Eduardo_Magalhães|lt=Lajeado Hydroelectric Power Plant|pt}} was completed on the Tocantins River, creating a large reservoir and giving the city new beaches. The project also included construction of a huge bridge: the {{Interlanguage link|Ponte Fernando Henrique Cardoso|lt=Fernando Henrique Cardoso Bridge|pt}}, {{convert|8|km|mi|sp=us}} long, connects Palmas with the major highway [[BR-153]] and the district of Luzimangues in [[Porto Nacional]].

The [[Palmas Airport]] connects Palmas with many Brazilian cities.

==History==
[[Tocantins]]'s capital, [[Miracema do Tocantins]], was replaced by Palmas upon the city's creation during 1990.<ref>{{cite web |title=History & future |url=http://www.palmas.org/palmashis.htm |website=Palmas Tocantins |access-date=September 26, 2024}}</ref>

==Geography==
Tocantins is a state between the [[Amazon Rainforest]] and the coastal [[savanna]]. As a result, its geography is varied. Many rivers cross through the state (including the [[Tocantins River]]). Researchers have identified more than 20 [[archaeology|archaeologically]] significant sites of early indigenous cultures in the state.

The municipality contains 88% of the {{convert|9931|ha}} [[Lajeado State Park]].<ref>{{citation|ref={{harvid|PES do Lajeado – ISA}}|language=pt
 |title=PES do Lajeado|publisher=ISA: Instituto Socioambiental
 |url=https://uc.socioambiental.org/uc/3951|access-date=2016-08-06}}</ref>

===Climate===
Most of Tocantins, including where Palmas is located, (except the extreme west and northern regions) is situated within a vast Brazilian area known as the [[cerrado]]. The cerrado region's typical climate is hot, semi-humid, with pronounced seasonality marked by a dry winter season from May through September. The annual rainfall is around 800 to 1600&nbsp;mm. The soils are generally very old, deep, and naturally nutrient-poor.

Palmas is one of the hottest capital cities in Brazil.<ref>{{cite news|title=Palmas é a cidade mais quente do Brasil|url=http://www.primeirapagina.to/noticia-1187-palmas-e-a-cidade-mais-quente-do-brasil.html|access-date=2015-10-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930174655/http://www.primeirapagina.to/noticia-1187-palmas-e-a-cidade-mais-quente-do-brasil.html|archive-date=2015-09-30|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the May to September dry season, Palmas can be oppressively hot as temperatures climb into the high 30s (°C). During the October to April rainy season, it is not as hot.  The heavy rains and cloud cover keep it much cooler. Palmas receives generous rainfall of about 1,300&nbsp;mm. It is situated in a 'bow' valley of Rio Tocantins and surrounded by mountains from three sides; with its low elevation, 195 metres above sea level, these factors increase the humidity and discomfort of hot days.

===Vegetation===
[[File:Palmas_TO_-_27234519688.jpg|thumb|View of Palmas.]]
In spite of being technically located in a watershed of the Amazon basin, Palmas has no rainforest. Typical are short shrubland trees common to a cerrado region. While the city layout was being developed, builders preserved many of the original trees, left intact in green areas along the widely spaced avenues. Many street trees in Palmas are much older than the city, which was started in 1990. Man-planted palms also grace the main thoroughfare, Avenida JK.

==Economy==
[[File:Palmas shopping entrada principal.jpg|thumb|left|A shopping mall in Palmas.]]
Palmas was designed to be the [[economic]] and administrative center of [[Tocantins]]. The service sector is the main driver of the economy. The share of [[agriculture]] in the economy is less than the service sector, being based on small farms around the [[city]] and the highways that provide access to Palmas. Larger farms, which cultivate soybeans and raise livestock, are located in the district of [[Buritirana]].
[[File:Cascata_Pca_Girassois_Palmas_TO.jpg|thumb|Girassóis Square in Palmas.]]
The economy is mostly formal, consisting primarily of limited partnerships and sole proprietorships. Micro firms are the most common in the city, where they comprise over 80% of the 4394 companies.
The city has four industrial districts, among them the Industrial District of Palmas, Tocantins Industrial District I Industrial District, and Industrial District Tocantins II of Taquaralto. All are located along the highways and TO-050 TO-010.

Today Palmas city has become a center whose trade and economic influence covers the entire state of Tocantins, in addition to the southeastern [[Pará]], the northeastern [[Mato Grosso]], and the southern [[Maranhão]].
In town are branches of the following national banks: [[Banco do Brasil]] (7 agencies), [[Banco Bradesco|Bradesco]] (five agencies, one of Bradesco Prime), [[Caixa Econômica Federal]] (4 agencies, 3 more ATM's), [[Itaú Unibanco]] (3 agencies), [[Banco da Amazônia]] (2 agencies), [[HSBC]] (1 agency), [[Santander Brasil|Santander]] (1 agency), [[Banco BMG]] (1 agency), [[Banco Cruzeiro do Sul]] (1 agency), and [[Tribanco]] (1 agency). Palmas has seven self-service terminals of the [[Banco 24 Horas]] [[interbank network]].
[[File:Vista de Palmas, Tocantins.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Palmas.]]
In 2007 the [[Gross Domestic Product]] had a strong expansion was estimated at $2.2 billion, driven by [[investments]] of the City of Palms in the economy. The increase in GDP of Palmas was 6% and, compared to that of [[Brazil]] was very considerable, as the country showed the percentage of 3.5%. By the end of 2007, and [[Capital (economics)|capital]] represented 18.4% of the wealth generated by Tocantins and 0.08% in the country. Due to this growth, Palmas has attracted major investments, such as the Capim Dourado Shopping (inaugurated in August/2010), the multimodal yard of the North-South (located in the municipality of Porto Nacional, on the banks of the TO-080), plus branches of hypermarket networks: Atacadão, Makro, Extra and Assam.
