== Etymology ==
The name Florianópolis is a tribute to Marshal [[Floriano Peixoto]], the [[List of Presidents of Brazil|second President]] (1891–1894) of the [[First Brazilian Republic|Republic of the United States of Brazil]] and from [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''polis'', meaning "city". Until 1893, the city was called '''''Nossa Senhora do Desterro''''' ({{IPA|pt|ˈnɔsɐ siˈɲɔɾɐ du desˈteʁu|lang}} or {{IPA|pt|dʒisˈteʁu|}}; {{literally|Our Lady of Banishment}}) or simply '''''Desterro'''''.

==Geography==
===Vegetation===
Florianópolis lies within the [[Atlantic Forest]] which has an extremely diverse and unique mix of vegetation and forest types. The main [[ecoregion]] is the coastal Atlantic forest, the narrow strip of about {{convert|50|–|100|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} along the coast which covers about 20 percent of the region. This forest extends as far as {{convert|500|–|600|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} inland and its range is as high as 2,000 meters above sea level. [[Altitude]] determines at least three vegetation types in the Atlantic Forest: the lowland forest of the coastal plain, montane [[forest]]s, and the high-altitude grassland or "campo rupestre."

[[File:Florianopolis_(4396376372).jpg|thumb|right|Downtown Florianópolis as seen from Morro da Cruz.]]
The municipality contains part of the {{convert|17104|ha}} offshore [[Marinha do Arvoredo Biological Reserve]], a fully protected conservation unit established in 1990.<ref>{{citation|language=pt|title=Unidade de Conservação: Reserva Biológica Marinha do Arvoredo|publisher=MMA: Ministério do Meio Ambiente |url=http://sistemas.mma.gov.br/cnuc/index.php?ido=relatorioparametrizado.exibeRelatorio&relatorioPadrao=true&idUc=214 |access-date=27 April 2016}}</ref>
It also contains part of the {{convert|84130|ha}} [[Serra do Tabuleiro State Park]], a mountainous area covered in lush forests.
The park protects the sources of the [[Vargem do Braço River|Vargem do Braço]], [[Cubatão River (south Santa Catarina)|Cubatão]] and [[Una River (Santa Catarina)|Una]] rivers, which supply most of the drinking water for greater Florianópolis and the south coast region.<ref>{{citation|ref={{harvid|Parque Estadual da Serra do Tabuleiro – FATMA}}|language=pt|title=Parque Estadual da Serra do Tabuleiro|publisher=FATMA: Fundação do meio Ambiente|url=http://www.fatma.sc.gov.br/conteudo/parque-estadual-da-serra-do-tabuleiro|access-date=11 June 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510084252/http://www.fatma.sc.gov.br/conteudo/parque-estadual-da-serra-do-tabuleiro|archive-date=10 May 2016}}</ref>
The municipality contains the {{convert|1,532|ha}} [[Rio Vermelho State Park]] in the northeast of [[Santa Catarina Island]], created in 2007.<ref>{{citation|language=pt|ref={{harvid|Parque Estadual do Rio Vermelho – FATMA}}|title=Parque Estadual do Rio Vermelho|publisher=FATMA: Fundação do Meio Ambiente|url=http://www.fatma.sc.gov.br/conteudo/parque-estadual-do-rio-vermelho|access-date=21 January 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120233041/http://www.fatma.sc.gov.br/conteudo/parque-estadual-do-rio-vermelho|archive-date=20 January 2017}}</ref>

===Precipitation===
There is significant [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] which is well distributed throughout the year. The annual normal precipitation for the period of 1961 through 1990 was {{convert|1517.8|mm|in}}.<ref name=INMET /> There is no dry season, and summer generally is the rainiest season. Increased [[rainfall]] occurs from January to March, with a median of {{convert|160|mm|in}} per month, and from April to December there is somewhat less precipitation, averaging {{convert|100|mm|in}} per month. The driest months are from June to August.

===Climate===
Florianópolis experiences a warm [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Koppen]]: Cfa), falling just short of a true [[tropical climate]]. The seasons of the year are distinct, with a well-defined summer and winter, and characteristic [[weather]] for [[autumn]] and spring. Due to the proximity of the sea, the relative [[humidity]] of the [[atmosphere]] is 80% on average.

The area is threatened by [[Climate change in Brazil|climate change]], with rising [[sea level]]s expected to lead to increased [[coastal erosion]]. [[Mangrove]]s are being planted in and around the city to help mitigate potential damage while restoring local ecosystems.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.mongabay.com/2024/06/a-brazilian-city-restores-its-mangroves-to-protect-against-climate-change/ |title=A Brazilian city restores its mangroves to protect against climate change |author=Letícia Klein |work=Mongabay |date=3 June 2024 |access-date=7 June 2024}}</ref>

The maximum [[temperature]]s of the hottest month varies from {{convert|25|to|38.8|°C|°F}} and the minimum temperatures are from {{convert|6|to|11|°C|°F}}. The lowest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-0.4|°C|°F}} in July 2000 while the highest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|38.8|°C|°F}} in February 1973.<ref name=INMET />

Carijós Indians, a [[Tupi people]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brand|first=Donald D.|date=1941|title=A Brief History of Anthropology in Brazil|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4291250|journal=New Mexico Anthropologist|volume=5|issue=4|pages=99–150|doi=10.1086/newmexianthr.5.4.4291250|jstor=4291250|s2cid=161022821|issn=0734-7030}}</ref> were the first inhabitants<ref>{{Cite web|title=Florianópolis {{!}} Brazil|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Florianopolis|access-date=10 April 2021|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> of the Florianópolis area. The traces of its presence are verified through archaeological sites and [[sambaquis]] dating up to 4000 years ago. The Indians called the place Meiembipe or "mountain along the channel".

Around 1514 the [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]] landed and gave the area the name Ilha dos Patos, but in 1526 it was renamed Ilha de Santa Catarina (Saint Catherine's Island). The area supplied the vessels that went to the River Plate (Río de la Plata) Basin.

The official settlement of the [[island]] began in 1673 with the arrival of [[bandeirante]] Francisco Dias Velho's agricultural company and it continued in 1678 with the construction of a [[chapel]] consecrated to Nossa Senhora do Desterro. At this time a villa began to take form, slowly becoming a [[Colony|colonial]] settlement.

To guarantee its domain the [[Portuguese Crown]] elevated Santa Catarina Island to the category of village in 1714 with the name of Nossa Senhora do Desterro and already in 1726 they promoted it again, now to the category of [[town]].

From this date on Vila do Desterro and mainly the port began to have a strategic function because it was situated halfway between [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Buenos Aires]], possibly two of the largest seaside cities of [[South America]] at that time. For this reason in 1739 the Capitania da Ilha de Santa Catarina was created and Desterro became its capital. Soon the most expressive seaside defensive ring of [[Southern Brazil]] started to be built: Santa Cruz, São José da Ponta Grossa, Santo Antonio and Nossa Senhora da Conceição da Barra do Sul [[fortress]]es.

With the coming of the [[Captaincies of Brazil|Captaincy]] the population began to grow, but the great population growth happened between 1747 and 1756 with the arrival of about 6,000 settlers coming from the Archipelago of [[Azores]] and from [[Madeira Island]]. The development of the agriculture, the cotton and linen industry and the commerce followed the Azorean occupation.
In 1823, during the monarchy which ended in 1889, Desterro became the Capital of Santa Catarina Province opening a period of prosperity with many urban works and also intense [[political]] [[organization]].

Regional elites not happy with the government centralization staged the [[Federalist Revolution|Federalist Revolt]] at the beginning of the [[Brazilian Republic]]. The movement that started in [[Rio Grande do Sul]] spread to Santa Catarina and turned Desterro into the Federalist Capital of the Republic. The then president of Brazil, marshal [[Floriano Peixoto]], known as the Iron Marshal, suppressed the rebellion and ordered the shooting of many people who were considered enemies of the state, in the [[Fortaleza de Santa Cruz de Anhatomirim|Anhatomirim Island Fortress]]. Possibly to show loyalty to the marshal, 1893 saw the change of the state [[Capital (political)|capital]]'s name: from Desterro to Florianópolis, that is to say, city of Floriano.

Florianópolis has a [[population]] mostly composed of Brazilians of [[European Brazilian|European descent]]. The numbers of immigrants started to increase in the mid-18th century, mostly with the arrival of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] colonists from the [[Azores Islands]]. The population of Florianópolis was composed mainly of Portuguese/Azoreans, Germans, and Italians. Further south, some neighborhoods preserve their [[rural]] [[village]] identity. The cultural heritage left by their Azorean ancestors is noticeable in their dialect, in handicrafts, and traditional festivities.

The small [[village]] of Santo António de Lisboa (Saint Anthony of Lisbon) is an example of colonial period architecture and in Ribeirão da Ilha, the oldest part of the [[Capital (political)|capital]], the inhabitants speak in an accent closer to the [[Azorean]] [[dialect]] of the first settlers. In Ribeirão da Ilha is the church of Our Lady of Lapa do Ribeirão, built in 1806. Lagoa da Conceição, with its many sand dunes, restaurants and seaside night life and where women make lace to sell in the street, has also managed to retain many traces of its colonial [[architecture]].<ref name="VisiteFloripa">{{cite web | url=http://www.visitefloripa.com.br/cultura_acoriana.php | title=Cultura Açoriana | publisher=Visite Floripa | access-date=3 December 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105000011/http://www.visitefloripa.com.br/cultura_acoriana.php | archive-date=5 January 2007}}</ref>

The city is densely populated, with a population distribution of 623.68 inhab./km<sup>2</sup>, the 6th highest in the state of Santa Catarina. The vast majority of Florianopólis residents live in the [[urban area]] of the municipality, corresponding to 96.2% of its inhabitants, while 3.78% live in the [[rural area]] of Florianópolis.<ref>[https://brasilescola.uol.com.br/brasil/florianopolis.htm Info of Florianópolis]</ref>

On the other side, the city has taken on a cosmopolitan air with the arrival of Brazilians from other states and [[alien (law)|foreigners]] who chose to live there. The island, which at the beginning of the colonization period, was an important whale hunting centre, is today a technological pole of the IT industry. A State Capital of interest to [[tourism]], Florianópolis population in 2020 was estimated to be around 508,826 people in the city proper and 1,111,702 people in the metropolitan area.

The city has invested heavily in infrastructure, from roads to schools, and Florianópolis ranks high on development measures such as [[literacy]] (97 percent) and [[electrification]] (near 100 percent). By the late 1990s, private companies were flocking to the [[island]], or emerging from a [[technology]] "[[wiktionary:Incubator|incubator]]" at the federal university. (Among the innovations it hatched: the [[DRE voting machine|computerized voting]] machines that have reduced fraud and increased efficiency in [[Brazilian elections]].)

Florianópolis is one of the most visited places in Brazil as it is an island with 42 beaches, lagoons and waterfalls.
===Beaches===
Conceição Lagoon (Lagoa da Conceição) is the largest lagoon on the Santa Catarina Island<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pureviagem.com.br/noticia/turismo-em-florianopolis-saiba-que-fazer-na-ilha-de-santa-catarina_a3859/1|title=Turismo em Florianópolis: saiba o que fazer na ilha de Santa Catarina|website=pureviagem.com.br|access-date=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827165354/http://www.pureviagem.com.br/noticia/turismo-em-florianopolis-saiba-que-fazer-na-ilha-de-santa-catarina_a3859/1|archive-date=27 August 2017}}</ref> and one of the most visited areas of the island by foreign travelers and backpackers. The adjacent district of the [[Lagoa da Conceição|same name]] has the highest concentration of restaurants, bars, organic markets and shops. Many expats and Brazilian people from other cities choose to live by the lagoon because of its views, safety, nature and quality of life.

The lagoon is surrounded by mountains and has a canal linking to the ocean. The history of the region around the lagoon is a plus with all the folklore, netting tradition, old Portuguese architecture, graffiti, and an 18th-century church on the top of the hill (see panoramic view below).

The Holy Spirit Feast (''Festa do Divino'') is a festival that takes place 40 days after Easter. The celebration dates to the colonial era and includes a parade, music, and [[street food]].

'''[[Praia Mole|Mole Beach]]''' (''Praia Mole'')
is one of the best known beaches near Conceição Lagoon and is noted for its rolling green hills and rock formations on either side.<ref name="expedia.com.au">{{Cite web|title=Mole Beach - Florianopolis Attraction {{!}} Expedia.com.au|url=https://www.expedia.com.au/Mole-Beach-Florianopolis.d6098096.Attraction|access-date=26 October 2020|website=Expedia.com.au|language=en-AU}}</ref> The beach is mostly known for surfing, eco-friendly lounges and LGBTQ scene during the summer. The beach is one of the locations for the ASP World Tour of the [[Association of Surfing Professionals]], which classifies 50 competitors, among professionals and amateurs. The state of Santa Catarina is the only location in South America for this [[surfing]] event.<ref name="expedia.com.au"/> [[Santa Catarina Art Museum]] is located in the city.

'''Joaquina Beach''' (''Praia da Joaquina'')
Became well known in the 1970s, when [[surfer]]s from around the world discovered its waves. Joaquina Beach is accessible from the Lagoon of Conceição. Many surf cups began to emerge, and great Catarinense surfing personalities. It is one of the beaches that offers the best tourist facilities, receiving a large number of tourists from around Brazil and the world on the warm days in spring and summer. The rock complex situated to the left of the beach, the night lighting and the public showers are some of the trademarks at Joaquina. There is a big paid parking lot, toilets, tourist coach parking lot, lifeguards, police station, handicraft shop, bars, restaurant and hotels. Sand boards can be rented on the spot.

'''[[Barra da Lagoa]]'''
Barra da Lagoa is a quaint fisherman's village. The physical characteristics of the beach makes it an ideal place to learn to surf. It is a cove on the Eastern part of the island and stretches into Moçambique beach for {{convert|15|km|mi}}. It is in a natural setting as there are no huge hotels on the beach and the Southern headquarters of [[Projeto TAMAR]] (Save the [[Turtle]]s) is located here. Penguins swim into the canal and near the beach of Barra da Lagoa during the colder winter months of June, July and August. The canal at Barra da Lagoa connects the [[Lagoa da Conceição]] with the open sea. It is not uncommon to see fishermen during the night tossing their nets in the lagoon to catch shrimp they sell to the fresh fish restaurants in this [[community]].

'''[[Praia dos Ingleses|Ingleses Beach]]''' (''Praia dos Ingleses'')
Even though it is a beach preferred by tourists, Ingleses still keeps to the traditions of the [[Azorian]] colonizers. In the [[summer]], it is one of the top beach destinations of Argentine tourists, second only to Canasveiras. In the [[winter]], mullet fishing, religious celebrations and regional festivities are demonstrations of the local culture. The dunes separating the Ingleses Beach (English Beach) from the Santinho Beach are the main [[natural]] attractions. The practice of [[sandboarding]] is quite common there, with vendors renting sand boards by the dunes. Those looking for a different outing can go on a trek of {{convert|4|km|mi}} over the dunes.

'''Armação Beach''' (''Praia da Armação'')
The Sant'Anna Church, built by the Armação fishing company, is part of the beach's history. It was from there that whale harpooners and crewmen confessed and attended the mass before going fishing. Next, the priest would go down to the [[beach]] to bless the boats that would sail out to sea. Today, the boats leave there for Ilha do Campeche, one of the most visited [[island]]s around Florianópolis. It is also in Armação that one finds one of the most important archaeological sites of the State of Santa Catarina. In the winter of 2010 a significant portion of the beach disappeared due to erosion. With financial aid from the Brazilian federal government, tons of large rocks were dumped on the beach to prevent houses from destruction.
[[File:Praia do Santinho.JPG|thumb|Santinho beach]]
'''[[Campeche (Florianópolis)|Campeche Beach]]''' (''Praia do Campeche'')
With {{convert|5|km|mi}} of white sands and a turbulent waters, Campeche is considered the Jeffreys Bay of the Santa Catarina Island for the quality of its waves. For those who are not interested in surfing, the beach offers other attractions. At [[night]], Campeche is also an attraction. The huge reflector illuminates part of the large sand strip in front of the bars. The [[Lighting|illumination]] favours the [[fishermen]] with the production in this area.

{{anchor|Santinho}}'''Santinho Beach''' (''[[:pt:Praia do Santinho|Praia do Santinho]]'')  is mainly sought by tourists who look for nature, and the location's tranquility. Surfers are the main visitors and consider Santinho to be the best beach in the North of the Santa Catarina Island. It is in the left hand corner, where bathers do not venture, that surfers practice their sport, sharing the space with fishermen. {{convert|40|km|mi}} away from the centre of Florianópolis, another attraction of this beach are the primitive inscriptions made by hunters, fishermen and collectors inhabiting the Island five thousand years ago. The name Santinho (little saint) comes from a human figure engraved (a [[petroglyph]]) on an isolated block of rock, the ''Costão do Santinho''.<ref name="Prefeitura de Florianópolis">{{cite web| title=Secretaria Municipal de Turismo, Tecnologia e Desenvolvimento Econômico | website=Prefeitura de Florianópolis | url=http://portal.pmf.sc.gov.br/entidades/turismo/index.php?cms=museu+arqueologico+ar+livre+costao+do+santinho | language=pt | access-date=1 December 2020}}</ref>

The island is connected to the Continent by three bridges. The [[Hercílio Luz Bridge]] that was built in 1926, this bridge is 11 years older than [[Golden Gate Bridge]]; it is a symbol of the island and often appears on postcard images. It is open to traffic along with The Colombo Sales Bridge and Pedro Ivo Bridge.

Santo Amaro da Imperatriz was the first thermal water facility in Brazil. Hotels with [[thermal bath]] facilities are located in the district of Caldas da Imperatriz and in the city of Águas Mornas.

===International airport===
Florianópolis is served by [[Hercílio Luz International Airport]] for both domestic and international flights.<ref name="infraero-fln">{{cite web | url=http://www.infraero.gov.br/index.php/aeroportos/santa-catarina/aeroporto-internacional-de-florianopolis.html | title=Aeroporto Internacional de Florianópolis/Hercílio Luz | publisher=Infraero | access-date=3 December 2014 | language=pt | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128132800/http://www.infraero.gov.br/index.php/aeroportos/santa-catarina/aeroporto-internacional-de-florianopolis.html | archive-date=28 January 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> 

It is one of the leading airports in Brazil for [[Air charter|charter flights]], especially during the summer months and from destinations such as [[Santiago]], [[Montevideo]], [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], besides domestic routes. The traffic has grown significantly at the airport and therefore the city plans to upgrade and expand the airport so that 2.7 million passengers can be accommodated annually.

The architectural design of the expansion was chosen by a public competition held by [[Infraero]] in partnership with the Brazilian Architects Institute (IAB).
Among the over 150 original entries, the proposal of São Paulo architect Mário Bizelli was chosen. Normally the projects for expansion and modernization of the 66 airports administered by Infraero are done by public tender based on the needs, criteria and conditions presented by the company's engineering area.

The privatization of Hercílio Luz International Airport resulted in the inauguration of the new passenger terminal in October 2019, which replaced the previous terminal from the 1970s, which was deactivated. As a result, the airport capacity grew from 1 million passengers to 3.5 million passengers a year, in the new and modern passenger terminal.<ref>[https://floripa-airport.com/melhorias-no-terminal-antigo.html Floripa Airport]</ref>
