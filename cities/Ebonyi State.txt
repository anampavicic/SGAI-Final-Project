'''Ebonyi State''' ({{lang-ig|Ȯra Ebonyi}}) is a [[States of Nigeria|state]] in the [[South East (Nigeria)|South-East geopolitical zone]] of [[Nigeria]], bordered to the north and northeast by [[Benue State]], [[Enugu State]] to the west, [[Cross River State]] to the east and southeast, and [[Abia State]] to the southwest. Named for the [[Abonyi (Aboine) River]]—a large part of which is in the state's south—Ebonyi State was formed from parts of [[Abia State|Abia]] and [[Enugu State|Enugu]] state in 1996 and has its capital in [[Abakaliki]].

One of the smallest [[states of Nigeria]], Ebonyi is the [[List of Nigerian states by area|33rd largest in area]] and [[List of Nigerian states by population|29th most populous]] with an estimated population of nearly 2.9 million as of 2016.<ref>{{cite web |title=Population 2006-2016 |url=https://nigerianstat.gov.ng/elibrary/read/474 |website=[[National Bureau of Statistics, Nigeria|National Bureau of Statistics]] |access-date=21 December 2021}}</ref> Geographically, the state is divided between the [[Cross–Niger transition forests]] in the far south and the drier [[Guinean forest–savanna mosaic]] in the rest of the state. The other important geographical features are the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]] and its tributary, the [[River Aloma]], which flow along Ebonyi's southeastern and eastern borders, respectively; while fellow Cross River tributaries, the Abonyi (Aboine), Asu, and Eze Aku rivers run through the state's interior. There are other smaller rivers like [[Ichelle]] and [[igbe]] which also form boundaries between [[Benue State|Benue]] and [[Ebonyi]] States to the West.

After independence in 1960, the area of now-Ebonyi was a part of the post-independence [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern Region]] until 1967 when the region was split and the area became part of the [[East Central State]]. Less than two months afterwards, the former Eastern Region attempted to secede in the three-year long [[Nigerian Civil War]] with Ebonyi as a part of the secessionist state of [[Biafra]]. At the war's end and the reunification of Nigeria, the [[East Central State]] was reformed until 1976 when the state's north became [[Anambra State]] and the south became [[Imo State]]. Fifteen years afterwards, Anambra and Imo states were divided with their eastern parts becoming [[Enugu State]] and [[Abia State]], respectively. It was not until 1996, when Enugu State's east and Abia's northeast were split off and joined to form Ebonyi State.<ref>{{cite web |title=This is how the 36 states were created |url=https://www.pulse.ng/news/local/nigerian-states-this-is-how-the-36-states-were-created/mdtnq3e |website=Pulse.ng |date=24 October 2017 |access-date=15 December 2021}}</ref>

Economically, Ebonyi State is based around agriculture, mainly of [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[rice]], [[oil palm]], and [[cassava]] crops. A key minor industry is mining due to [[lead]], [[zinc]], and [[limestone]] deposits around Abakaliki, and locally hand-made baskets of various sizes at [[Ntezi]].<ref>{{cite web |title= Abakaliki|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Abakaliki|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|access-date=21 December 2021}}</ref> Ebonyi has the [[List of Nigerian states by Human Development Index#2019|joint-twentieth highest]] [[Human Development Index]] in the country and numerous institutions of tertiary education.<ref>{{cite web |title=Human Development Indices |url=https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/shdi/ |website=Global Data Lab |access-date=15 December 2021}}</ref>
