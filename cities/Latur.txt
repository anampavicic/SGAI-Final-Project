==History==
Latur has an ancient history, which probably dates to the [[Rashtrakuta]] period. It was home to a branch of Rashtrakutas which ruled the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] from 753 to 973&nbsp;AD. The first [[Rashtrakuta]] king, '''[[Dantidurga]]''', was from Lattaluru, the ancient name for Latur. Ratnapur is also mentioned as an historic name for Latur.<ref name="MofI">{{Cite web|title=Latur District Map: History of Latur |publisher=Maps of India |url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/maharashtra/districts/latur.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517015534/http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/maharashtra/districts/latur.htm |archive-date=17 May 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The King [[Amoghavarsha]] of [[Rashtrakutas]] developed the Latur city. The Rashtrakutas who succeeded the [[Chalukyas]] of [[Badami]] in 753 AD called themselves the residents of Lattaluru.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2011-09-19|title=The rule of the Chalukyas of Badami came to an end with Kirtivarman II who was overthrown by Dantidurga, a Rashtrakuta|url=https://www.preservearticles.com/notes/the-rule-of-the-chalukyas-of-badami-came-to-an-end-with-kirtivarman-ii-who-was-overthrown-by-dantidurga-a-rashtrakuta/11931|access-date=2022-02-20|website=PreserveArticles.com: Preserving Your Articles for Eternity|language=en-US}}</ref>

It was, over the centuries, variously ruled by the [[Satavahanas]], the [[Sakas]], the [[Chalukyas]], the Yadavas of [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Deogiri]], the [[Delhi Sultanate#Sultans|Delhi Sultans]], the [[Bahamani]] rulers of South India, [[Adilshahi]], and the [[Mughals]].

In Latur's Papvinashak Temple a 12th-century inscription of King [[Someshvara III]] was found. According to that inscription, 500 scholars were living in Lattlaur (Latur) at that time and that Latur was the city of King Someshwar.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Deshmukh|first=Pranav|date=20 August 2020|title=Latur chya itihasacha paiilu 86 varshanantar ujedat|work=Sakal paper-Today Latur}}</ref>

In the 19th century, Latur became part of the [[Princely state]] of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]]. In 1905 it was merged with surrounding areas and renamed Latur tehsil, becoming part of [[Osmanabad district]]. Before 1948, Latur was a part of [[Hyderabad State]] under [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizam]]. The chief of the [[Razakars (Hyderabad)|Razakar]]'s, [[Qasim Rizwi]], was from Latur.

After [[Indian independence movement#Sovereignty and partition of India|Indian independence]] and the [[Indian annexation of Hyderabad]], [[Osmanabad]] became part of [[Bombay Province]]. In 1960, with the creation of Maharashtra, Latur became part of one of its districts. On 16 August 1982, a separate [[Latur district]] was carved out of [[Osmanabad]] district.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Zilla Parishad, Latur|url=http://zplatur.gov.in/htmldocs/leftframe/aboutLatur.htm|access-date=2022-02-20|website=zplatur.gov.in}}</ref>

===Latur earthquake of 1993===
{{Main|1993 Latur earthquake}}

On 30 September 1993, at 3:53&nbsp;a.m. local time, Latur was almost completely destroyed by a devastating [[intraplate earthquake]] that affected the southern [[Marathwada]] region of Maharashtra state in central-western part of India—including Latur, Beed, Osmanabad, and adjoining districts about {{convert|400|km}} south-east of [[Mumbai]]—and resulted in a huge loss of life. The earthquake measured only 6.3 on the [[Richter magnitude scale]], but its [[Hypocenter|focus]] was relatively shallow, at around {{convert|12|km}} deep. Consequently, the resultant shock waves, being unattenuated, caused more damage. The quake caused around 10,000 deaths <ref name="EERI Newsletter January 1994">{{cite web|title=The September 29, 1993, M6.4 Killari, Maharashtra Earthquake in Central India, EERI Newsletter, Vol. 28, No. 1, January 1994|url=http://www.nicee.org/eqe-iitk/uploads/EQR_Killari.pdf|access-date=15 March 2016}}</ref> and 30,000 were injured, mainly due to the poor construction of stone houses and huts which collapsed on people who were fast asleep. After the earthquake, seismic zones were reclassified, and building codes and standards revised, all over India.
