'''West Kalimantan''' ({{langx|id|Kalimantan Barat}}) is a [[Provinces of Indonesia|province of Indonesia]]. It is one of five Indonesian provinces comprising [[Kalimantan]], the Indonesian part of the island of [[Borneo]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]]. It is bordered by [[East Kalimantan]] and [[Central Kalimantan]] to the east, the [[Malaysia]]n state of [[Sarawak]] to the north, and the [[Bangka Belitung Islands]] to the west and the [[Java Sea]] to the south. The province has an area of 147,037&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, and had a population of 4,395,983 at the 2010 Census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 5,414,390 at the 2020 Census;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 5,623,328 (comprising 2,887,209 males and 2,736,119 females), and was projected to rise to 5,695,500 at mid 2024.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Provinsi Kalimantan Barat Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.61)</ref> Ethnic groups include the [[Dayak people|Dayak]], [[Malay people|Malay]], [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Bugis]], and [[Madurese people|Madurese]]. The borders of West Kalimantan roughly trace the mountain ranges surrounding the vast watershed of the [[Kapuas River]], which drains most of the province. The province shares land borders with [[Central Kalimantan]] to the southeast, [[East Kalimantan]] to the east, and the Malaysian territory of [[Sarawak]] to the north.

West Kalimantan is nicknamed "The Province of a Thousand Rivers". The nickname references the geography of the province, which features hundreds of rivers of varying size, most of which are navigable. Several major rivers are still the main route for freight to the hinterland, despite road infrastructure now reaching most districts.

Although a small part of West Kalimantan region is seawater, West Kalimantan has dozens of large and small islands (mostly uninhabited) spread along the [[Karimata Strait]] and [[Natuna Sea]] that borders the province of [[Riau Islands]]. The total population in the province, according to the 2010 census totalled 4,395,983 inhabitants<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011"/> and at the 2020 Census it was 5,414,390,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> but by mid 2023 it was officially estimated to have reached 5,623,328.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Provinsi Kalimantan Barat Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.61)</ref>

== History ==
The history of West Kalimantan was dominated with Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms ruling over the region and Borneo as a whole after that this kingdoms converted into muslim sultanate. 

Its modern history in 17th century. The Malays are the native Muslims of West Kalimantan and established their [[Sultanate of Sambas|Sultanates of Sambas]] since 1609 in Sambas territory, along with [[Mempawah Kingdom|Mempawah Sultanate]] established since 1740 ruled in between Pontianak and Sambas territory. The Mempawah Sultanate brought in workers from China at the beginning of the kingdom. The same policy followed by the Sambas Sultanate around 1750, which brought in workers from China to work in the gold mines in the area.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=2005-03-22 |editor-last=Lindsey |editor-first=Tim |editor2-last=Pausacker |editor2-first=Helen |title=Chinese Indonesians : remembering, distorting, forgetting |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1355/9789812305442 |journal=Timothy Lindsey |doi=10.1355/9789812305442|isbn=978-981-230-544-2 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Raditya |first=Iswara N. |date=2017-09-12 |title=Republik Lanfang, Republik Pertama di Nusantara |url=https://tirto.id/republik-lanfang-republik-pertama-di-nusantara-cwtg |access-date=2024-07-25 |website=tirto.id |language=id}}</ref>

The high Chinese population in this province was due to a republic founded by Chinese miners called the [[Lanfang Republic]] (蘭芳共和國: Republik Lanfang), an autonomous state allied with [[Pontianak Sultanate|Pontianak]] and [[Sultanate of Sambas|Sambas Sultanate]], as a sub-state of the [[Qing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tirto.id/republik-lanfang-republik-pertama-di-nusantara-cwtg|title=Republik Lanfang, Republik Pertama di Nusantara |website=tirto.id|access-date=16 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200511125852/https://tirto.id/republik-lanfang-republik-pertama-di-nusantara-cwtg|archive-date=11 May 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The government of Lanfang was ended in West Kalimantan after the [[Mandor rebellion|Dutch Invasion]] in 1884. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

West Kalimantan was under [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese occupation]] from 1942 to 1945, when Indonesia declared its Independence. During the Japanese occupation, more than 21,000 people in Pontianak (including sultans, men, women and children) were kidnapped, tortured and massacred by Japanese troops during the [[Pontianak incidents]]. All the Malay Sultans on Kalimantan were executed and the Malay elite was devastated by the Japanese.<ref name="kajomag">{{cite web|url=https://kajomag.com/the-mandor-affair-the-massacres-in-west-kalimantan-during-wwii/|title=The Mandor Affair, the massacres in West Kalimantan during WWII|access-date=2022-01-21|work=Kajomag|date=2019-09-18|first=Patricia|last=Hului}}</ref> Most of the victims were buried in several giant wells in Mandor (88&nbsp;km from Pontianak).

A monument called Makam Juang Mandor was created to memorialize the event.

On 12 May 1947, the [[West Borneo (Special Region)|West Kalimantan Autonomous region]] was established. It was led by [[Syarif Hamid II of Pontianak]], who supported the Dutch endeavour to establish a federal [[United States of Indonesia]] (RUSI), of which West Kalimantan would have been a component. Following the 5 April 1950 arrest of Sultan Hamid for complicity in the [[APRA coup d'état|APRA coup]] attempt against the RUSI government led by [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) officer [[Raymond Westerling]], there were demands from the public for a merger into the [[Republic of Indonesia (1949–50)|Republic of Indonesia]], which took place on 22 April. On 15 August, The West Kalimantan autonomous region became part of Kalimantan Province, and two days later, the RUSI ceased to exist, and was replaced with a unitary Republic of Indonesia.<ref>{{Citation | last = Reid | first = Anthony J.S | author-link = Anthony Reid (academic) | title = The Indonesian National Revolution, 1945–1950 | publisher = Longman | year = 1974 | location = Hawthorn, Victoria, Australia |page=110| isbn = 0-582-71047-2 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last = Ricklefs| first = M.C. | author-link = M.

West Kalimantan was the site of substantial fighting during the [[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation]] under the [[Sukarno]] government in the mid-1960s. After [[Suharto]] deposed Sukarno in 1965, the confrontation was quickly resolved. Domestic conflict continued, however, for another ten years between the new [[New Order (Indonesia)|Suharto government]] and fighters organized during the confrontation and backed by the banned [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI).

During the 1930s the [[Dutch East Indies]] government initiated a "[[Transmigration program|transmigration plan]]" to move people from heavily populated islands such as [[Java]], to the less populated islands of [[Irian Jaya]] and Kalimantan. In the 1960s the Indonesian government granted the [[Madurese people|Madurese]] rights to clear forests for palm oil cultivation. This conflicted with the local Dayak tribes' traditional way of life. The tensions between the two ethnic groups resulted in major eruptions of violence in 1996, the [[Sambas riots]] in 1999 and the [[Sampit conflict]] in 2001, resulting in thousands of deaths.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ploughshares.ca/libraries/ACRText/ACR-IndonesiaKalimantan.html |title=Armed Conflicts Report.

== Geography ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2024}}
=== Boundary ===
West Kalimantan Province is located in the western part of the island of Borneo, or in between the lines 2°08'N and 3°05'S and between 108°0'E and 114°10'E. The province is traversed by the Equator (latitude 0°), precisely through the city of [[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]]. West Kalimantan has a tropical climate, with often high temperatures accompanied by high humidity.

Other specific characteristics are that the West Kalimantan region is one of the provinces in Indonesia which has a land border with another country, namely the State of [[Sarawak]], [[East Malaysia]]. Even with this position, West Kalimantan is currently the only province in Indonesia that have officially has an access road to get in and out of a neighbouring country. West Kalimantan and Sarawak have open roads approximately 400&nbsp;km long, spanning Pontianak-Entikong-[[Kuching]] (Sarawak, Malaysia) and can be reached about six to eight hours of travel. In the northern part of the province, there are four regencies that directly borders Malaysia, namely [[Sambas Regency|Sambas]], [[Sanggau Regency|Sanggau]], [[Sintang Regency|Sintang]] and [[Kapuas Hulu Regency|Kapuas Hulu]], which stretch along with the Kalingkang Mountains-Kapuas Hulu.

Most of West Kalimantan is low-lying land, with a total area of 147,037 km2, or 7.53 percent of the total Indonesian land area or 1.13 times the size of the island of [[Java]]. This region stretches straight from north to south along more than 600&nbsp;km and about 850&nbsp;km from west to east. Judging from the size of the territory, West Kalimantan is Indonesia's third largest province by area, after [[Papua (province)|Papua]] (421,891&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and [[Central Kalimantan]] (152,600&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). The largest regency is [[Kapuas Hulu]] (31,318&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> or 21.3 percent of the provincial area), followed by [[Ketapang Regency|Ketapang]] (30,019&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> or 20.4 percent)  and [[Sintang Regency|Sintang]] (22,026&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> or 15.0 percent), with the rest spread over the nine other regencies and two cities.

=== Topology ===
In general, West Kalimantan land is low-lying and has hundreds of rivers are safe when navigable, slightly hilly which extend from west to east along the valley Kapuas and Natuna Sea / Strait Karimata. Most of the land area is a swampy mix of peat and mangrove forests. The land area is flanked by two mountain ranges, namely, Kalingkang Mountains in the North and the Schwaner Mountains in the south along the border with the province of Central Kalimantan. Judging from the soil texture, the majority of West Kalimantan's area consists of the soil type PMK (podsolic red-yellow), which covers an area of about 10.5&nbsp;million hectares, or 17.28 per cent of the total area of 14.7&nbsp;million hectares. Next, the ground OGH (organosol, gley and hummus) and the alluvial soil of about 2.0&nbsp;million hectares, or 10.29 per cent sprawled across Dati II, but most likely in the coastal district.

Influenced by the vast lowlands, the heights of the mountains are relatively low as well as non-volcanically active. The highest mountain is Mount Baturaya in Serawai District of Sintang Regency which has an altitude of 2,278 metres above sea level, far lower than Mount Semeru (East Java, 3,676 metres) or Mount Kerinci (Jambi, 3,805 metres).

Mount Lawit is located in Kapuas Hulu District, Embaloh Hulu and more formerly known in West Kalimantan. It only is the third highest because it has a high 1,767 metres, while the second highest is Mount Batusambung (in Ambalau District) with a height of up to 1,770 metres.

=== Lakes and Rivers ===
West Kalimantan is an area that could be called "The Thousand Rivers Province". The nickname is in line with the geographical conditions that have hundreds of large and small rivers, among others, which can be and often are navigable. Several major rivers are still the lifeblood and mainline to transport the countryside, although the road infrastructure has been able to reach most districts.

The longest river is the [[Kapuas River]], which is also the longest river in Indonesia (1,086&nbsp;km), along which 942&nbsp;km are navigable. Other great rivers are the Melawi, (navigable 471&nbsp;km), Pawan (197&nbsp;km), Kendawangan (128&nbsp;km), Jelai (135&nbsp;km), Sekadau (117&nbsp;km), Sambas (233&nbsp;km ), and Landak (178&nbsp;km).

Although rivers are very numerous in West Kalimantan, there are only two significant lakes in the province. These are Lake Sentarum and Lake Luar I, which are in [[Kapuas Hulu Regency|Kapuas Hulu]]. Lake Sentarum has an area of 117,500 hectares, which sometimes is almost dry in the dry season, and Lake Luar I, which has an area of approximately 5,400 hectares. Both of these lakes have potential as tourist attractions.

== Government and administrative divisions ==
Until 1999 the province was composed of six regencies (''kabupaten'') and the independent City (''kota'') of Pontianak. A seventh regency, '''Bengkayang''', was formed on 20 April 1999 from part of Sambas Regency, and an eighth, '''Landak''', was formed on 4 October 1999 from part of Mempawah Regency. A second independent city, '''Singkawang''', was formed on 21 June 2001 from part of Bengkayang Regency. On 18 December 2003 '''Sekadau''' Regency was cut out of Sanggau Regency, and '''Melawi''' Regency was cut out of Sintang Regency, while on 2 January 2007 '''North Kayong''' Regency was cut out of Ketapang Regency, and on 17 July 2007 '''Kubu Raya''' Regency was cut out of Mempawah Regency. West Kalimantan is thus now subdivided into two cities and twelve regencies.
About 29 per cent of the province's population lives in the Greater Pontianak area.

=== Proposed new province of Kapuas Raya ===
On 25 October 2013, the Indonesian People's Representative Council (DPR) began reviewing draft laws on the establishment of 57 prospective regencies and 8 new provinces; one of the proposed new provinces is '''Kapuas Raya''' (Great Kapuas) in West Kalimantan. This proposed measure has been held in abyance since 2013, but if and when the bill is approved, this will make Kapuas Raya the seventh largest province in [[Indonesia]] after [[Central Kalimantan]], [[East Kalimantan]], [[South Papua]], [[Riau]], [[South Sumatra]] and the newly-reduced [[Papua (province)]], as the total area of [[Kapuas Raya]], encompassing five regencies, will measure 81,897.81 square km, or 55.7 per cent of the current size of West Kalimantan. Ever since 2005, the five regencies in the eastern part of West Kalimantan (Sanggau, Sekadau, Sintang, Melawi and Kapuas Hulu) have floated a concept to establish [[Kapuas Raya]] due to the distance issues from the respective regencies to the province capital [[Pontianak]]. The distance between the farthest regency of Kapuas Hulu and Mempawah is 661&nbsp;km, followed by Melawi (439&nbsp;km), Sintang (395&nbsp;km), Sekadau (315&nbsp;km) and Sanggau (267&nbsp;km).<ref>Jakarta Post, 14 November 2013</ref>
