'''Pécs''' ({{IPAc-en|p|eɪ|tʃ}} {{respell|PAYTCH}}, {{IPA-hu|peːt͡ʃ|lang|hu-Pécs.ogg}}; {{langx|hr|Pečuh}}; [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''Päťkostolie'' {{langx|de|Fünfkirchen}}, {{IPA|de|fʏnfˈkɪʁçn̩|pron|De-Fünfkirchen.ogg}}; also known by [[#Name|alternative names]]) is [[List of cities and towns of Hungary#Largest cities in Hungary|the fifth largest city]] in [[Hungary]], on the slopes of the [[Mecsek]] mountains in the country's southwest, close to the border with [[Croatia]]. It is the administrative and economic centre of [[Baranya County]], and the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pécs]].

A city dating back to ancient times, settled by the Celts and the Romans, it was made an [[episcopal see]] in early medieval Hungary. It has [[University of Pécs|the oldest university]] in the country, and is one of its major cultural centers. It has a rich cultural heritage from the age of a 150-year Ottoman occupation. It is historically a multi-ethnic city where many cultures have interacted through 2,000 years of history. In recent times, it has been recognized for its cultural heritage, including being named as one of the [[European Capital of Culture]] cities. The Roman-era [[Early Christian Necropolis of Pécs|Christian necropolis in Pécs]] was inscribed as a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2000.

== Name ==
The earliest name for the territory was its [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] name of ''Sopianæ''. The name possibly comes from the plural of the Celtic ''sop'' meaning "marsh".{{cn|date=August 2024}}

The medieval city was first mentioned in 871 under the name {{lang|la|Quinque Basilicae}} ("five cathedrals".) The name refers to the fact that when constructing the churches of the city, the builders used material from five old Christian chapels. In later Latin documents the city was mentioned as ''Quinque Ecclesiae'' ("five churches", a name identical in meaning to the German name ''Fünfkirchen'' and the Slovak name {{lang|sk|Päťkostolie}}<ref name="books.google.com">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3vnAAAAMAAJ&q=P%C3%A4%C5%A5kostolie |title=Slovenská reč: časopis pre výskum a kultúru slovenského jazyka - Google Knihy |access-date=2013-03-12|year=1998 }}</ref>).

The name ''Pécs'' appears in documents in 1235 in the word ''Pechyut'' (with modern spelling: ''pécsi út'', meaning "road to/from Pécs") most likely derives from the [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]] ''*pęčь'' or from the [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]] ''*penče'', both meaning five.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Kniezsa |first=István |year=1962 |editor-last=Beke |editor-first=Ödön |title=Pécs város neve |trans-title=The name of the city of Pécs |journal=[[Magyar Nyelvőr]] |pages=326–329}}</ref> In other languages: in [[Latin]], ''Quinque Ecclesiae''; in [[Italian language|Italian]], ''Cinquechiese''; in [[Croatian language|Croatian]], ''Pečuh''; in [[Serbian language|Serbian]], {{lang|sr|Печуј}} (''Pečuj''); in [[Slovak language|Slovak]], ''Päťkostolie''; in [[Czech language|Czech]], {{lang|cs|Pětikostelí}}; in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], {{lang|nl|Vijfkerken}}; in [[German language|German]], ''Fünfkirchen''; and in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], ''Peçuy''.

== Geography ==
Pécs is located in the [[Carpathian Basin]] of [[Central Europe]], in the center of the southern Hungarian county of [[Baranya (county)|Baranya]]. It is bordered by the [[Mecsek]] hills to the north, and by a rolling plain to the south. Pécs has a significant [[mining]] past. Mecsek dolomitic water is famous for its steady, balanced high density of minerals.

The city of Pécs is located near the border of Croatia. Its southern part is rather flat whereas its northern part clings to the slope of the Mecsek mountains. It has a very favorable climate, and is bordered by a flourishing woody area. During hot summer nights a cooling air streams down from Mecsek to clean the air of the city.<ref>[http://www.pecs2010.hu/hun/ Pécs klímája] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609080653/http://www.pecs2010.hu/hun/ |date=2008-06-09 }}</ref>

Pécs is bordered by plains to the south (elevation 120–130 m), while the Mecsek mountains rise up to elevations of 400–600 meters behind the city. Jakab-hill, located in the western Mecsek, is 592&nbsp;m (1942&nbsp;ft) tall, Tubes, straight above Pécs, is 612&nbsp;m (2008&nbsp;ft) tall, and Misina is 535&nbsp;m (1755&nbsp;ft) tall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kislexikon.hu/mecsek-hegyseg.html|title=Mecsek-hegység - Lexikon ::|first=BioDigit|last=Kft.|website=www.kislexikon.hu|access-date=2010-04-05|archive-date=2010-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125202632/http://www.kislexikon.hu/mecsek-hegyseg.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Higher parts of the city climb up to 200–250 m (656 to 820&nbsp;ft), mainly [[Pécsbánya]], [[Szabolcsfalu]], [[Vasas (Pécs)|Vasas]] and [[Somogy (Pécs)|Somogy]]. Woody areas generally start from elevations of about 300&nbsp;m (984&nbsp;ft). The Mecsek hills are marked by numerous valleys which play a key role in ameliorating the climate of the city in the absence of lakes and rivers. Waters coming down from the Mecsek hills flow into the Pécsi stream under the east–west rail road leading them eventually to the [[Danube]].

=== Ancient Roman city ===
[[File:Pécs - Early Christian Mausoleum 02.JPG|thumb|left|Early Christian Necropolis of Pécs (Sopianae)]]
{{Main|Early Christian Necropolis of Pécs}}
The area has been inhabited since ancient times, with the oldest archaeological findings being 6,000 years old. Before the Roman era, the area was inhabited by [[Celts]].

The city of '''''Sopianae''''' was founded by [[Roman Empire|Romans]] at the beginning of the 2nd century, in an area peopled by [[Celts]] and [[List of ancient tribes in Illyria#Pannonian tribes|Pannoni]] tribes. 

In the early 2nd century, when much of western Hungary was a province of the [[Roman Empire]] named [[Pannonia]], the Romans founded several wine-producing colonies under the collective name of Sopianae where Pécs now stands.

The centre of Sopianae was where the Bishop's Palace now stands. Some parts of the [[Roman aqueduct]] are still visible. When the Roman province of Pannonia was divided into four administrative divisions, Sopianae was named the capital of the division named Valeria.

By the 4th century, Sopianae became the capital of [[Pannonia Valeria|Valeria province]] and a significant early Christian center. The early Christian necropolis in the city dates back to this era, and the Christian tombs there are unique in their architectural design (with underground burial chambers below above-ground memorial chapels) and are highly decorated with Christian murals.<ref name = "unesco">{{cite web |url = https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/853 |title = Early Christian Necropolis of Pécs (Sopianae) |website = UNESCO World Heritage Convention |publisher = United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization |access-date = 14 May 2023}}</ref> These tombs became a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in December 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pecs.hu/index.php?foid=1&oldal=koszonto|title=Pécs, a kultúra városa|website=Pécs, a kultúra városa|access-date=2010-04-05|archive-date=2008-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424162830/http://www.pecs.hu/index.php?foid=1&oldal=koszonto|url-status=live}}</ref> By the end of the century, Roman rule weakened in the area, mostly due to attacks by [[Barbarians]] and [[Huns]].

=== Early medieval city ===
When [[Charlemagne]] arrived in the area in 791, it was ruled by the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]]. Charlemagne, after conquering the area, annexed it to the [[Holy Roman Empire]],<ref name="Gubcsi" /> and it belonged to the [[Diocese of Salzburg]].<ref name="Kleindel">Kleindel: ''Österreich, Zahlen – Daten - Fakten'', Sonderausgabe A&M 2004, ISBN 3-902397-49-7</ref>

A document written in [[Salzburg]] in 871 is the first document mentioning the early medieval city under the name ''Quinque Basilicae''.<ref name="books.google.com"/> During the 9th century, the city was inhabited by [[Slavs]] and Avars, and was part of the [[Balaton Principality]], a [[Franks|Frankish]] vassal state.<ref name='Gubcsi'/>

=== The Hungarian city in the Middle Ages ===

According to [[György Györffy]]'s theory of place names, after the Hungarians [[Conquest of Hungary|conquered the Carpathian Basin]], they retained a semi-nomadic lifestyle, changing pastures between winter and summer. [[Árpád]]'s winter quarters – clearly after his occupation of Pannonia in 900 – were perhaps in Pécs.<ref name='Gubcsi'>Lajos Gubcsi, [http://mek.oszk.hu/09100/09132/09132.pdf Hungary in the Carpathian Basin] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200312171632/http://mek.oszk.hu/09100/09132/09132.pdf |date=2020-03-12 }}, MoD Zrínyi Media Ltd, 2011</ref>  Later, when the Comitatus of Baranya was established, the capital of the comitatus was not Pécs but a nearby castle, [[Branjin|Baranyavár]] ('Baranya Castle'). Pécs, however, became an important religious centre and episcopal seat. In Latin documents, the city was mentioned as ''Quinque Ecclesiae''. Around 1000, the area was inhabited by the [[Black Magyars]]. The Deed of Foundation of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pécs|Diocese of Pécs]] was issued in 1009.

The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pécs]] was founded in 1009 by [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I]], and the first university in Hungary was founded in Pécs in 1367 by [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I the Great]]. (The largest university still resides in Pécs with about 34,000 students.)<ref>[http://www.okm.gov.hu/main.php?folderID=1488&articleID=233289&ctag=articlelist&iid=1 www.okm.gov.hu, Oktatási és Kulturális Minisztérium oldala, Az Oktatási Évkönyv 2008/2009 letölthető PDF-formátumban.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625120920/http://www.okm.gov.hu/main.php?folderID=1488 |date=2007-06-25 }}</ref>

[[Peter Orseolo]], the second king of Hungary, was buried in the cathedral in 1046. The location of his grave is unknown. This is because in 1064, when King [[Solomon of Hungary|Solomon]] made peace with his cousin, the later King [[Géza I of Hungary|Géza I]], they celebrated [[Easter]] in Pécs. Shortly after the cathedral burnt down. The cathedral that stands today was built after this, in the second half of the 11th century.

Several religious orders settled down in Pécs. The [[Benedictine order]] was the first in 1076. In 1181, there was already a hospital in the city. The first [[Dominican order|Dominican]] monastery of the country was built in Pécs in 1238.

King [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]] founded a university in Pécs in 1367 following the advice of William, the bishop of [[Bishopric of Pécs|Pécs]], who was also the king's chancellor. It was the first university in Hungary. The founding document is almost word for word identical with that of the [[University of Vienna]], stating that the university has the right to teach all arts and sciences, with the exception of [[theology]].

In 1459, [[Janus Pannonius]], the most important medieval poet of Hungary became the bishop of Pécs. He strengthened the cultural importance of the city.

Pécs was formed into one of the cultural and arts center of the country by bishop [[Janus Pannonius]], great [[Humanism|humanist]] poet.<ref>[http://www.dravanet.hu/hunor/frame-pecs%20hun.htm Pécs kulturális központ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315062531/http://dravanet.hu/hunor/frame-pecs%20hun.htm |date=2009-03-15 }}</ref>

After the [[Battle of Mohács]] (1526) in which the invading Ottoman army defeated the armies of [[Louis II of Hungary|King Louis II]], the armies of [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman]] occupied Pécs. Not only was a large part of the country occupied by Ottomans, the public opinion of who should be the king of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] was divided, too. One party supported [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand of Habsburg]], the other party crowned [[John Zápolya]] in [[Székesfehérvár]].{{cn|date=March 2023}} The citizens of Pécs supported Ferdinand, but the rest of Baranya county supported John. In the summer of 1527, Ferdinand defeated the armies of Szapolyai and was crowned king on November 3. Ferdinand favoured the city because of the support of its citizens, and exempted Pécs from paying taxes. Pécs was rebuilt and fortified.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

In 1529, the Ottomans captured Pécs again, and went on a campaign against Vienna. The Ottomans forced Pécs to accept King John (who was allied with them) as their ruler. John died in 1540. In 1541, the Ottomans occupied the castle of [[Buda]], and ordered [[Isabella Jagiello|Isabella]], the widow of John to give Pécs to them, since the city was of strategic importance.{{cn|date=March 2023}} The citizens of Pécs defended the city against the Ottomans, and swore loyalty to Ferdinand.{{cn|date=March 2023}} The emperor helped the city and defended it from further Ottoman attacks, but his advisers persuaded him into focusing more on the cities of [[Székesfehérvár]] and [[Esztergom]] instead of Pécs. Pécs was preparing for the siege, but a day before, [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and [[Walloons|Walloon]] mercenaries fled from the city, and raided the nearby lands. The next day in June 1543 the Bishop himself went to the Ottomans with the keys of the city.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

After occupying the city, the Ottomans fortified it and turned it into a real Ottoman city. The Christian churches were turned into [[mosque]]s; [[Turkish bath]]s and [[minaret]]s were built, [[Qur'an school]]s were founded, there was a [[bazaar]] in place of the market.{{cn|date=March 2023}} For a hundred years the city was an island of peace in a land of war. It was a [[sanjak]] centre in [[Budin Province, Ottoman Empire|Budin Eyalet]] at first and [[Kanije Province, Ottoman Empire|Kanije Eyalet]] later as "Peçuy".

The Ottoman era resulted in numerous landmarks, such as the [[Mosque of Pasha Qasim|mosque of Pasha Qasim the Victorious]] on [[Széchenyi square (Pécs)|Széchenyi square]], the Tomb of İdris Baba, and the [[Yakovalı Hasan Paşa Mosque]].

The Ottoman chronicler [[İbrahim Peçevi]] (Ibrahim of Pécs), whose work forms the main body of reference for Ottoman history between 1520 and 1640, was a native of the city.<ref>[https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/93102 İbrahim Peçevi (Ibrahim Pečevija), an Ottoman Historian from Pécs Writing on Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina] (in Croatian). [[University of Zagreb]]. Retrieved 2 June 2023</ref>

In 1664, [[Croat]]-[[Hungarians|Hungarian]] nobleman [[Nikola Zrinski|Nicholas Zrínyi]] arrived in Pécs, with his army. Since the city was well into the Ottoman territories, they knew that even if they occupy it, they could not keep it for long, so they planned only to pillage it. They ravaged and burned the city but could not occupy the castle. Mediaeval Pécs was destroyed forever, except the wall encircling the historical city, a single bastion (Barbakán), the network of tunnels and [[catacombs]] beneath the city, parts of which are closed down, other parts are in possession of the famous Litke champagne factory, and can be visited today. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Several Turkish artifacts also survived, namely three mosques, two minarets, remnants of a bath over the ancient Christian tombs near the cathedral, and several houses, one even with a stone cannonball embedded in the wall.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

After the castle of Buda was wrested from Ottoman rule in 1686, the armies went to capture the rest of Pécs. The advance guards could break into the city and pillaged it.{{cn|date=March 2023}} The Ottomans saw that they could not hold the city, and burnt it, and withdrew into the castle. The army led by [[Louis of Baden]] occupied the city on 14 October and destroyed the aqueduct leading to the castle. The Ottomans had no other choice but to surrender, which they did on 22 October (see [[Siege of Pécs]]).

The city was under [[martial law]] under the command of Karl von Thüngen. The Viennese court wanted to destroy the city first, but later they decided to keep it to counterbalance the importance of [[Szigetvár]], which was still under Ottoman rule. Slowly the city started to prosper again, but in the 1690s two plague epidemics claimed many lives. In 1688 German settlers arrived. Only about one-quarter of the city's population was Hungarian, the others were Germans or Southern Slavs. Census of taxpayers from 1698 lists 637 families for which  Janja Živković Mandić concludes that 308 were of Croatian nationality (Catholics Croats, Racs, Šokci, Bunjevci, Illyrians, Slavs, Bosniaks) and the remaining 329 were Hungarians, Germans, Serbs or Greeks. According to same census István Tabo mentions 171 Hungarian, 349 Slavs and 79 Germans while Đuro Šarošac mentions that at that time in the city lived 325 Croats, 139 Hungarians, 92 Germans, 53 Vlachs and 28 Serbs.<ref>Ladislav Heka, 2016,  The Borders Of Baranja

Because Hungarians were only a minority of the population, Pécs did not support the revolution against Habsburg rule led by [[Francis II Rákóczi]], and his armies pillaged the city in 1704.

=== Early-modern era ===

A more peaceful era started after 1710. Industry, trade and viticulture prospered, manufactories were founded, a new city hall was built. The feudal lord of the city was the [[Bishop of Pécs]], but the city wanted to free itself from episcopal control. Bishop [[George Klimó]], an enlightened man (who founded the first [[public library]] of the country) would have agreed to cede his rights to the city, but the [[Holy See]] forbade him to do so. When Klimó died in 1777, Queen [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] quickly elevated Pécs to [[free royal town]] status before the new bishop was elected. This cost the city 83,315 forints.

According to the first [[census]] (held in 1787 by the order of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]), there were 1,474 houses and 1,834 families in Pécs, a total of 8,853 residents, of which 133 were priests and 117 were noblemen.

In 1785, the Academy of [[Győr]] was moved to Pécs. This academy eventually evolved into a law school. The first stonework theatre of the city was built in 1839.
At that time or Maria Theresia and her son Josef II, the [[Danube Swabians]] from Germany was settled in the City.

===  19th century and later ===
The industry developed a lot in the second half of the 19th century. By 1848, there were 1,739 industrial workers. Some of the manufactures were nationally famous. The iron and paper factories were among the most modern ones of the age. Coal mining was relevant. A sugar factory and beer manufactures were built, too. The city had 14,616 residents.

During the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|revolution in 1848–49]], Pécs was occupied by Croatian armies for a short time, but it was freed from them by Habsburg armies in January 1849.

After the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] Pécs developed, like all the other cities and towns of the country. From 1867, Pécs is connected to the nearby town [[Barcs]] by railway, and since 1882 it is also connected to [[Budapest]]. In 1913, a tram system has been founded, but it was extinguished in 1960.

At the end of [[Hungary in World War I|World War I]], Baranya county was occupied by [[Serbia]]n troops, and it was not until August 1921 that Pécs could be sure that it remains part of Hungary. The University of Pressburg (modern-day [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]]) was moved to Pécs after Hungary lost Pressburg according to the [[Treaty of Trianon]].

During [[Hungary in World War II|World War II]], Pécs was captured by [[Red Army|Soviet]] troops of the [[3rd Ukrainian Front]] on 29 November 1944 in the course of the [[Budapest Offensive]]. The city suffered only minor damages, even though a large tank-battle took place {{convert|20|-|25|km|0|abbr=off}} south of the city, close to the Villány area late in the war, when the advancing [[Red Army]] fought its way towards Austria. Until the end of World War II, the majority Inhabitants was [[Danube Swabians]]. Some of the former German settlers was expelled to Germany and Austria in 1945-1948, under the 1945 [[Potsdam Agreement]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://ldu-online.de/die-vertreibung | title=Die Vertreibung – Landsmannschaft der Deutschen aus Ungarn | access-date=2022-01-17 | archive-date=2022-01-16 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220116000200/https://ldu-online.de/die-vertreibung | url-status=live }}</ref> [[Germans of Hungary]] are still a minority in the City.

Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.</ref> After the war, development became fast again, and the city grew, absorbing several nearby towns. In the 1980s, Pécs already had 180,000 inhabitants.

After the end of [[Soviet occupation of Hungary|Socialist]] era (1989–1990), Pécs and its county, like many other areas, were hit hard by the changes, the unemployment rate was high, the mines and several factories were closed, and the war in neighboring [[Yugoslavia]] in the 1990s affected the tourism.

Pécs was also the centre of the [[Nordic Support Group]] (NSG) consisting of units from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Poland, as part of the [[IFOR]] and later [[SFOR]] [[NATO]] deployments, after the Dayton Agreement and following peace in former Yugoslavia; the first units were deployed to Pécs in late 1995 and early 1996. The NSG handled the relaying of supply, personnel and other logistical tasks between the participating countries and their deployed forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

In 1998 Pécs was given the UNESCO prize "''Cities for Peace"'' for maintaining its cultural minorities, and also for its tolerant and helping attitude toward refugees of the [[Yugoslav Wars]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hetek.hu/hatter/199804/pecs_a_tolerans_varos|title=Pécs, a toleráns város - Hetek Közéleti Hetilap|website=Hetek Közéleti Hetilap|access-date=2010-04-05|archive-date=2011-07-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721112555/http://www.hetek.hu/hatter/199804/pecs_a_tolerans_varos|url-status=live}}</ref>

A good example of the city's history and interesting past can be seen in the main square, where the Gazi Kasim Mosque still stands, and, although consecrated as a church following the retreat of the Ottoman Turks centuries ago, the crescent moon of Islam is still visible on the cupola, surmounted by a cross. Indeed, Pécs is the richest town in Hungary in terms of Turkish architecture, with the ruins of Memi Pasa's Baths and the mausoleum of miracle worker Idris Baba, just two other notable remains. The [[Yakovalı Hasan Paşa Mosque]], dating from the mid-1600s, still functions as an active mosque today. It is open to the public except during [[Friday prayers|Friday services]] from 2.30 to 3.30 pm.

Historically Pécs was well known in Hungary for its industry with several factories, but after the [[End of communism in Hungary (1989)|fall of the Iron Curtain]] many have not managed the economic transition well and went bankrupt (e.g. Pécsi Kesztyűgyár, Pécsi Bőrgyár, Littke Pezsgőgyár etc.).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pecsma.hu/abszolut-pecs/tele-van-pecs-az-iparoscsaladok-oroksegeivel/|title=Tele van Pécs az iparoscsaládok örökségeivel|first=Gyimesi|last=Viktor|date=26 July 2016|publisher=www.pecsma.hu|access-date=8 May 2018|archive-date=9 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509151024/https://www.pecsma.hu/abszolut-pecs/tele-van-pecs-az-iparoscsaladok-oroksegeivel/|url-status=live}}</ref> Until some years ago, it had a [[coal mining|coal]] and [[uranium mining|uranium mine]], now only its [[sand mining|sand mine]] exists and is operated by the Hungarian-owned ''Quartz''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quartzkft.hu/bemutatkozas.html|title=Quartz Kft - Bemutatkozás|website=quartzkft.hu|access-date=2018-05-08|archive-date=2017-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826144828/http://quartzkft.hu/bemutatkozas.html|url-status=live}}</ref> mining company.

The [[University of Pécs]] was founded by [[Louis I of Hungary]] in 1367. It is the oldest university in Hungary, and is among the first European universities. In the recent past it used to be divided in two universities, one for Medicine and Orthodontics (POTE)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aok.pte.hu/|title=PTE Általános Orvostudományi Kar|website=PTE Általános Orvostudományi Kar|access-date=2019-04-27|archive-date=2019-05-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502084317/http://aok.pte.hu/|url-status=live}}</ref> and a larger one for other studies: JPTE (Janus Pannonius Tudományegyetem). The POTE (Pécs University Medical School, now known as the Medical School) has a large English program for general medicine and dentistry (with students from America, Asia, Africa, and European countries - including many Scandinavians) and a new German program. On 1 January 2000 these universities were combined under the name University of Pécs (acronym: PTE - Pécsi Tudományegyetem - University of Pécs). Nowadays, the University of Pécs has become the most internationalized university in Hungary with around 5000 international students out of the total of approximately 20000 students (around 25%).<ref>{{Cite web|title=International Relations in a Nutshell|url=https://international.pte.hu/international-relations/overview|access-date=2022-01-29|website=international.pte.hu|language=en|archive-date=2022-01-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220129230023/https://international.pte.hu/international-relations/overview|url-status=live}}</ref>
