'''Neuquén''' ({{IPA|es|newˈken}}; {{lang-arn|Nehuenken}}) is the capital city of the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Neuquén Province|Neuquén]] and of the [[Confluencia Department]], located in the east of the province. It occupies a strip of land west of the confluence of the [[Limay River|Limay]] and [[Neuquén River|Neuquén]] rivers which form the [[Río Negro (Argentina)|Río Negro]], making it part of the [[ecoregion]] of [[Alto Valle del Río Negro]]. The city and surrounding area have a population of more than 340,000, making it the largest city in [[Patagonia]].  Along with the cities of [[Plottier]] and [[Cipolletti]], it is part of the [[Neuquén – Plottier – Cipolletti]] [[conurbation]].

Founded in 1904, it is the newest provincial capital city in [[Argentina]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ciudades y capitales – año y fundador|url=https://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/datos/ciudades_capitales.php|work=El Historiador|access-date=25 November 2017}}</ref> 

==Etymology==
The name of the city comes from the [[Neuquén River]], which in [[Mapuche language]] means "water that has strength".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Oreja |first1=Pablo Fermín |title=¿Son los neuquinos "atrevidos, arrogantes y audaces"?, Por Pablo Fermín Oreja08-01-04 |url=http://www1.rionegro.com.ar/arch200401/08/o08j03.php |website=Rio Negro |access-date=4 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208123148/http://www.rionegro.com.ar/arch200401/08/o08j03.php |archive-date=8 February 2005 |language=es |date=8 January 2004}}</ref> This name was already used since 1884 for the [[federal territory]]. Since 1902, it was used for the railway station of the town, which at that time was a hamlet called Confluencia. The name of the town was officially chosen in 1904, when it was declared the capital of the territory.<ref>{{cite web |title=Neuquén, nombre en uso antes de la fundación 24-08-03 |url=http://www1.rionegro.com.ar/arch200308/s24j19.html |website=Rio Negro |access-date=4 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031014151255/http://www1.rionegro.com.ar/arch200308/s24j19.html |archive-date=14 October 2003 |language=es |date=24 August 2003 |url-status=live}}</ref> It is the only Argentine city that has a [[palindrome]] name, that is a word which reads the same backward as forward.<ref>{{cite news |title=Qué es un palíndromo y porqué se festeja su día este martes 22 de febrero - Tiempo Argentino |url=https://www.tiempoar.com.ar/informacion-general/que-es-un-palindromo-y-porque-se-festeja-su-dia-este-martes-22-de-febrero/ |access-date=4 May 2022 |work=Tiempo Argentino |date=22 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220222180829/https://www.tiempoar.com.ar/informacion-general/que-es-un-palindromo-y-porque-se-festeja-su-dia-este-martes-22-de-febrero/ |archive-date=22 February 2022 |language=es}}</ref>

==Economy==
Neuquén is both an important agricultural center, surrounded by fertile lands [[irrigation|irrigated]] by the waters of the Limay and Neuquén rivers in an otherwise arid province, and a petrochemical industrial center that receives oil extracted from different points of the province. It belongs economically and geographically to the [[Río Negro (Argentina)#Alto Valle|Alto Valle]] region that produces apples, pears, and other fruits.

With the discovery of the Vaca Muerta oil fields west of the city (the third largest shale gas and oil reserves in the world),{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} it has begun to experience a boom in real estate and construction. It is expected that over the next few years the city will experience unprecedented growth as it is the only significant city in the region. It has an airport, shopping centers, office space and institutions to become the center of the operations not only of the oil and gas companies, but also their suppliers.

==Transport==
[[National Route 22 (Argentina)|National Route 22]] (RN22) is the main road linking Neuquén with the rest of Argentina. Since 2021<ref>{{cite web |title=Gutiérrez firmó el traspaso de la multitrocha de la ex ruta 22 a la órbita local |url=https://www.neuqueninforma.gob.ar/gutierrez-firmo-el-traspaso-de-la-multitrocha-de-la-ex-ruta-22-a-la-orbita-local/ |website=Neuquén Informa |date=26 January 2021 |access-date=2023-01-10}}</ref> it runs in eastern-western direction north of the city center through the ''Parque Industrial'' area, mostly as a four-lane motorway, linking the city with the Atlantic coast at [[Bahía Blanca]] to the East and [[Temuco]] ([[Chile]]), [[San Carlos de Bariloche]] and [[Zapala]] to the West and South-West. The former RN22, now called ''Avenida General Mosconi'', a wide fast-transit avenue, runs in east-western direction through the southern part of the city center and divides the city into two halves.

The [[Presidente Perón Airport]] is {{convert|8|km|abbr=off|sigfig=1}} west of the city center near the boundary to [[Plottier]] and serves regular flights to [[Buenos Aires]], [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Salta]], [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], [[Comodoro Rivadavia]] and [[San Martín de los Andes]].

The [[Tren del Valle]] [[commuter rail]] service links Neuquén with neighbouring [[Cipolletti]] and [[Plottier]]. Freight trains run to [[Bahía Blanca]] and [[Zapala]].

Local transport consists of 30 bus lines, connecting most areas of the city, including [[Plottier]] and [[Las Perlas]]. The network is run by bus companies ''Ko-Ko'' and ''Empresa Tigre Iguazú''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rionegro.com.ar/sociedad/nuevos-colectivos-en-neuquen-como-funcionara-la-aplicacion-y-donde-se-sumaran-las-nuevas-lineas-2683741/|title=Así son los nuevos colectivos en Neuquén: cómo funcionará la app y dónde se sumarán líneas|website=Diario Río Negro|date=6 January 2023 |access-date=2023-01-10}}</ref> Additionally, several suburban lines connect the city with other cities and towns in the wider metro area, like [[Cipolletti]], [[Centenario, Neuquén|Centenario]], Senillosa, [[General Roca]] and [[Villa Regina]].

While the [[Río Negro (Argentina)|Río Negro]] and [[Río Limay]] are navigable, there are no port facilities in Neuquén and nearby cities. There was some commercial navigation in the Alto Valle area in the first half of the 20th century, but it has been abandoned since then.<ref>{{cite web|website=Diario Río Negro|url=https://www.rionegro.com.ar/navegacion-por-el-rio-negro-cuando-su-cauce-era-una-ruta-GY6076228/|title=Navegación por el río Negro, cuando su cauce era una ruta|date=30 November 2018 |access-date=2023-01-10}}</ref>

==History==
{{further|Puelmapu}}
{{more references|section|date=July 2020}}
The first inhabitants of the area were very mobile and moved according to the seasons of the year, climatic conditions, and the abundance of food and game.  Around the 16th century the people living in different areas of the province began to be [[Araucanization of Patagonia|assimilated]] by the [[Mapuche]] people.<ref name="histneu4">''Historia del Neuquén'', Pangera Editora, 2001, page 27.</ref> One of the most important [[Camino de los chilenos|trails]] used by the Mapuches passed through the area of the confluence of the Limay and Neuquén rivers.  

In the 17th century European explorers arrived in the area of the confluence. 

In 1604, [[Hernando Arias de Saavedra]] decided to explore the trails to Patagonia.  With the support of the ranchers of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Corrientes, he departed from Buenos Aires and passed through the mountains of the [[Sierra de la Ventana]]. He reached what is now the city of Neuquén and continued on, possibly passing through what is today [[Auca Mahuida]]. 

In 1782, departing from [[Carmen de Patagones]], [[Basilio Villarino]] traveled upstream on the [[Río Negro (Argentina)|Río Negro]].  On 23 January 1783, he arrived at the confluence of the Limay and Neuquén Rivers, camping on an island.<ref name="histleyendas">''Neuquén: Historia y leyendas'', InterPatagonia.</ref> He then followed the Limay to the confluence of the [[Collón Curá River|Collón Curá]], then from there to the [[Chimehuin River]].<ref name="choelechoel">''Naves y navegantes por Choele Choel'', Rio Negro Online, H. Pérez Morando.</ref>

===Neuquén as an Argentine Province===
In 1885, the lands of what was at that time called Confluencia (i.e., "confluence," referring to the two rivers) were auctioned to a few people. Shortly after the [[Conquest of the Desert]] campaign conducted by the military over Patagonia, the [[Tehuelche people|Tehuelche]] and [[Pehuenche people|Pehuenche]] tribes that inhabited the province of Neuquén were either killed or pushed out of these lands.

Since there was no defined border with [[Chile]], the Argentine government reached an agreement with the British-owned [[Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway]] company that was constructing a railway network, mainly in [[Buenos Aires Province]], to build an extension to the town in exchange for lands, in order to populate it. In 1899, the railroad reached [[Cipolletti]] in [[Río Negro province]], and three years later, after the [[Neuquén-Cipolletti bridges|construction of the bridge]], arrived at Neuquén.

Neuquén was officially founded on 12 September 1904, and the capital of the territory was transferred from [[Chos Malal]] to the young town. The name "Neuquén" derives from the [[Mapudungun]] word ''nehuenken'', meaning drafty, which the native people used in reference to this river.

By 1930, the town had only 5,000 inhabitants. In the 1960s, it acquired a new importance when oil deposits were found in the province by the state company [[Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales|YPF]]. The 1970s and 1980s saw massive demographic growth, accompanied by improvements such as the creation of the [[National University of Comahue]] in 1971.

In 2020, Sister [[Mónica Astorga Cremona]], a Carmelite nun, founded Costa Limay Sustainable Complex for Transgender Women in Neuquén, the first permanent housing program in the world for transgender people.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/13270/pope-sends-message-of-support-to-nun-working-with-trans-people | title=Pope sends message of support to nun working with trans people }}</ref>
