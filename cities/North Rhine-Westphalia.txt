'''North Rhine-Westphalia''' or '''North-Rhine/Westphalia''',{{efn|({{langx|de|Nordrhein-Westfalen}}, {{IPA|de|ˌnɔʁtʁaɪn vɛstˈfaːlən|pron|De-Nordrhein-Westfalen2.ogg}}; {{langx|li|Noordrien-Wesfale}} {{IPA-li|ˈnoːʀtʀiːn wæsˈfaːlə|}};{{citation needed|date=September 2023}} {{langx|nds|Noordryn-Westfaulen}} or {{lang|nds|Noordrhien-Westfalen}}{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}}} commonly shortened to '''NRW''',{{efn|{{IPA|de|ɛnʔɛʁˈveː|lang|De-NRW.ogg}}}} is a [[States of Germany|state]] (''Land'') in [[Old states of Germany|Western Germany]]. With more than 18 million inhabitants, it is the [[List of German states by population|most populous]] state in Germany. Apart from the [[city-state]]s, it is also the [[List of German states by population density|most densely]] populated state in Germany. Covering an area of {{convert|34084|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, it is the [[List of German states by area|fourth-largest]] German state by size.

North Rhine-Westphalia features 30 of the 81 German municipalities with over 100,000 inhabitants, including [[Cologne]] (over 1 million), the state capital [[Düsseldorf]] (630,000), [[Dortmund]] and [[Essen]] (about 590,000 inhabitants each) and other cities predominantly located in the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] [[metropolitan area]], the largest urban area in Germany and the fourth-largest on the [[European continent]]. The location of the Rhine-Ruhr at the heart of the European [[Blue Banana]] makes it well connected to other major European cities and metropolitan areas like the [[Randstad]], the [[Flemish Diamond]] and the [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main Region]].

North Rhine-Westphalia was established in 1946 after [[World War II]] from the [[Prussia]]n provinces of [[Province of Westphalia|Westphalia]] and the northern part of [[Rhine Province]] ([[North Rhine]]), and the [[Free State of Lippe]] by the [[British occupation zone in Germany|British military administration]] in [[Allied-occupied Germany]] and became a state of the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] in 1949. The city of [[Bonn]] served as the federal capital until the [[reunification of Germany]] in 1990 and as the [[seat of government]] until 1999.

Culturally, North Rhine-Westphalia is not a uniform area; there are significant differences, especially in traditional customs, between the Rhineland region on the one hand and the regions of Westphalia and Lippe on the other. [[Economy of North Rhine-Westphalia|Its economy]] is the largest among [[List of German states by GRDP|German states by GRDP]] but is below the national average [[List of German states by GRDP per capita|in GRDP per capita]].

==History==
{{Main|History of North Rhine-Westphalia}}

===Creation===
[[File:Locator_map_North_Rhine-Westphalia_in_Germany.svg|thumb|Additional map exhibiting the region]]
The state of North Rhine-Westphalia was established by the [[Allied-occupied Germany|British military administration]]'s "Operation Marriage" on 23 August 1946 by merging the [[province of Westphalia]] and the northern parts of the [[Rhine Province]], both being political divisions of the former [[state of Prussia]] within the [[German Reich]].<ref name="HistoryNRW">{{cite web|title=History of North Rhine-Westphalia|url=http://www.nrw.de/en/north-rhine-westphalia/history/|publisher=Government of North Rhine-Westphalia|access-date=10 April 2011}}</ref><ref name=DWNRW>{{cite news|last=Wagener|first=Volker|title=North Rhine-Westphalia: an overview|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,3901456,00.html|access-date=26 July 2011|newspaper=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=18 November 2009}}</ref> On 21 January 1947, the former state of [[Lippe (state)|Lippe]] was merged with North Rhine-Westphalia.<ref name="HistoryNRW"/> The [[constitution of North Rhine-Westphalia]] was then ratified through a [[referendum]].

===Rhineland===
{{Main|Rhineland}}
The first written account of the area was by its conqueror, [[Julius Caesar]], the territories west of the Rhine were occupied by the [[Eburones]] and east of the Rhine he reported the [[Ubii]] (across from Cologne) and the [[Sugambri]] to their north. The Ubii and some other Germanic tribes such as the [[Cugerni]] were later settled on the west side of the Rhine in the Roman province of [[Germania Inferior]]. Julius Caesar conquered the tribes on the left bank, and Augustus established numerous fortified posts on the Rhine, but the Romans never succeeded in gaining a firm footing on the right bank, where the Sugambri neighboured several other tribes including the [[Tencteri]] and [[Usipetes]]. North of the Sigambri and the Rhine region were the [[Bructeri]].

As the power of the Roman empire declined, many of these tribes came to be seen collectively as [[Ripuarian Franks]] and they pushed forward along both banks of the Rhine, and by the end of the fifth century had conquered all the lands that had formerly been under Roman influence. By the eighth century, the Frankish dominion was firmly established in western Germany and northern Gaul, but at the same time, to the north, Westphalia was being taken over by [[Saxons]] pushing south.

The [[Merovingians|Merovingian]] and [[Carolingians|Carolingian]] Franks eventually built an empire which controlled first their Ripuarian kin, and then the Saxons. On the division of the [[Carolingian Empire]] at the [[Treaty of Verdun]], the part of the province to the east of the river fell to [[East Francia]], while that to the west remained with the kingdom of [[Lotharingia]].<ref name="eb1911">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Rhine Province}}</ref>

By the time of [[Otto I]] (d. 973), both banks of the Rhine had become part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and the Rhenish territory was divided between the duchies of [[Upper Lorraine]] on the [[Moselle]] and [[Lower Lorraine]] on the Meuse. The [[Ottonian dynasty]] had both Saxon and Frankish ancestry.

[[File:1801 Cary Map of Westphalia, Germany - Geographicus - Westphalia-cary-1799.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[Lower Rhenish–Westphalian Circle]] in 1799 by [[John Cary]]]] 
As the central power of the Holy Roman Emperor weakened, the Rhineland split into numerous small, independent, separate vicissitudes and special chronicles. The old Lotharingian divisions became obsolete, although the name survives for example in [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] in France, and throughout the Middle Ages and even into modern times, the nobility of these areas often sought to preserve the idea of a preeminent [[duke]] within Lotharingia, something claimed by the [[Duchy of Limburg|Dukes of Limburg]], and the [[Duchy of Brabant|Dukes of Brabant]]. Such struggles as the [[War of the Limburg Succession]] therefore continued to create military and political links between what is now Rhineland-Westphalia and neighbouring [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]].

In spite of its dismembered condition and the sufferings it underwent at the hands of its French neighbours in various periods of warfare, the Rhenish territory prospered greatly and stood in the foremost rank of German culture and progress. Aachen was the place of coronation of the German emperors, and the ecclesiastical principalities of the Rhine bulked largely in German history.<ref name="eb1911"/>

Prussia first set foot on the Rhine in 1609 by the occupation of the [[Duchy of Cleves]] and about a century later [[Prussian Guelders|Upper Guelders]] and [[Moers]] also became Prussian. At the peace of Basel in 1795, the whole of the [[left bank of the Rhine]] was resigned to France, and in 1806, the Rhenish princes all joined the [[Confederation of the Rhine]].

After the Congress of Vienna, Prussia was awarded the entire [[Rhineland]], which included the [[Grand Duchy of Berg]], the ecclesiastic electorates of [[Electorate of Trier|Trier]] and [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], the free cities of [[Aachen]] and Cologne, and nearly a hundred small lordships and abbeys. The Prussian [[Rhine province]] was formed in 1822 and Prussia had the tact to leave the lower Rhenish districts in undisturbed possession of the liberal institutions to which they had become accustomed under the republican rule of the French.<ref name="eb1911"/> In 1920, the districts of [[Eupen]] and [[Malmedy]] were transferred to Belgium (see [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]]).

===Westphalia===
{{Main|Westphalia}}
Around AD&nbsp;1, numerous incursions occurred through Westphalia and perhaps even some permanent [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] or Romanized settlements. The [[Battle of Teutoburg Forest]] took place near Osnabrück and some of the [[Germanic tribes]] who fought at this battle came from the area of Westphalia. [[Charlemagne]] is thought to have spent considerable time in [[Paderborn]] and nearby parts. His [[Saxon Wars]] also partly took place in what is thought of as Westphalia today. Popular legends link his adversary [[Widukind]] to places near [[Detmold]], [[Bielefeld]], [[Lemgo]], Osnabrück, and other places in Westphalia. Widukind was buried in [[Enger]], which is also a subject of a legend.

Along with [[Eastphalia]] and [[Engern]], Westphalia (''Westfalahi'') was originally a district of the [[Duchy of Saxony]]. In 1180, Westphalia was elevated to the rank of a duchy by Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Barbarossa]]. The [[Duchy of Westphalia]] comprised only a small area south of the [[Lippe River]].

[[File:Westfaelischer Friede in Muenster (Gerard Terborch 1648).jpg|thumb|Ratification of the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648 in [[Münster]] by Gerard Terborch]]
Parts of Westphalia came under [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]n control during the 17th and 18th centuries, but most of it remained divided duchies and other feudal areas of power. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648, signed in Münster and Osnabrück, ended the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The concept of nation-state sovereignty resulting from the treaty became known as "[[Westphalian sovereignty]]".

As a result of the [[Protestant Reformation]], there is no dominant religion in Westphalia. Catholicism and [[Lutheranism]] are on relatively equal footing. Lutheranism is strong in the eastern and northern parts with numerous free churches. [[Münster]] and especially [[Paderborn]] are thought of as Catholic. Osnabrück is divided almost equally between Catholicism and Protestantism.

After the defeat of the [[Prussian Army]] at the [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt]], the [[Treaties of Tilsit|Treaty of Tilsit]] in 1807 made the Westphalian territories part of the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] from 1807 to 1813. It was founded by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and was a [[First French Empire|French]] [[vassal state]]. This state only shared the name with the historical region; it contained only a relatively small part of Westphalia, consisting instead mostly of [[Hesse|Hessian]] and [[Eastphalia]]n regions.

After the [[Congress of Vienna]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] received a large amount of territory in the Westphalian region and created the [[province of Westphalia]] in 1815. The northernmost portions of the former kingdom, including the town of [[Osnabrück]], had become part of the states of [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]] and [[Grand Duchy of Oldenburg|Oldenburg]].

==Flags and coat of arms==
The [[flag of North Rhine-Westphalia]] is green-white-red with the combined coats of arms of the [[Rhineland]] (white line before green background, symbolizing the river Rhine), [[Westfalen]] (the white horse) and [[Lippe]] (the red rose). After the establishment of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1946, the tricolor was first introduced in 1948, but was not formally adopted until 1953.<ref name="flag1953">{{cite web |author=Government of North Rhine-Westphalia  |url=http://sgv.im.nrw.de/lmi/owa/pl_text_anzeigen?v_id=1220040120130647172 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20050312154959/http://sgv.im.nrw.de/lmi/owa/pl_text_anzeigen?v_id=1220040120130647172 |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 March 2005 |title=Gesetz über die Landesfarben, das Landeswappen und die Landesflagge |language=de |date=10 March 1953  |access-date=10 February 2008}}</ref> The plain variant of the tricolor is considered the [[civil flag]] and state ensign, while government authorities use the [[state flag]] (''Landesdienstflagge'') which is defaced with the [[coat of arms of North Rhine-Westphalia|state's coat of arms]].<ref name="flag1953"/> The state ensign can easily be mistaken for a distressed [[flag of Hungary]], as well as the former national [[flag of Iran]] (1964–1980). The same flag was used by the [[Rhenish Republic]] (1923–1924) as a symbol of independence and freedom.

The horse on the coat of arms is a reference to the [[Saxon Steed]], a heraldic motif associated with both Westphalia and [[Lower Saxony]]. The horse first featured in the 15th century coat of arms of the Duchy of Westphalia, before being inherited by the Prussian province of Westphalia and finally the modern state of North Rhine-Westphalia.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lloyd |first=James |date=2017 |title=The Saxon Steed and the White Horse of Kent |url=https://kentarchaeology.org.uk/node/78530 |journal=Archaeologia Cantiana |volume=138 |pages=1}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:North Rhine-Westphalia Topography 08.png|upright=1.3|thumb|left|Geographic map of North Rhine-Westphalia]]

North Rhine-Westphalia encompasses the plains of the [[Lower Rhine]] region and parts of the [[Central Uplands]] (''[[die Mittelgebirge]]'') up to the gorge of [[Porta Westfalica (gorge)|Porta Westfalica]]. The state covers an area of {{convert|34,083|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and shares borders with [[Belgium]] ([[Wallonia]]) in the southwest and the [[Netherlands]] ([[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], [[Gelderland]] and [[Overijssel]]) in the west and northwest. It has borders with the German states of [[Lower Saxony]] to the north and northeast, [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] to the south and [[Hesse]] to the southeast.

Approximately half of the state is located in the relative low-lying terrain of the [[Westphalian Lowland]] and the [[Rhineland]], both extending broadly into the [[North German Plain]]. A few isolated hill ranges are located within these lowlands, among them the Hohe Mark, the [[Beckum Hills]], the [[Baumberge]] and the [[Stemweder Berg|Stemmer Berge]]. <br>
The terrain rises towards the south and in the east of the state into parts of Germany's [[Central Uplands]]. These hill ranges are the [[Weser Uplands]] – including the [[Egge Hills]], the [[Wiehen Hills]], the [[Wesergebirge]] and the [[Teutoburg Forest]] in the east, the [[Sauerland]], the [[Bergisches Land]], the [[Siegerland]] and the [[Siebengebirge]] in the south, as well as the left-Rhenish [[Eifel]] in the southwest of the state. The [[Rothaargebirge]] in the border region with [[Hesse]] rises to height of about 800 m above sea level. The highest of these mountains are the [[Langenberg (Rothaargebirge)|Langenberg]], at 843.2 m above sea level, the [[Kahler Asten]] (840.7 m) and the Clemensberg (839.2 m).

[[File:Kahler Asten von Norden.jpg|thumb|The highest peaks in North Rhine-Westphalia are located in the Rothaar Mountains.]]

The planimetrically determined centre of North Rhine-Westphalia is located in the south of Dortmund-[[Aplerbeck]] in the Aplerbecker Mark (51° 28' N, 7° 33' Ö). Its westernmost point is situated near [[Selfkant]] close to the Dutch border, the easternmost near [[Höxter]] on the [[Weser]]. The southernmost point lies near [[Hellenthal]] in the [[Eifel]] region. The northernmost point is the NRW-Nordpunkt near [[Rahden]] in the northeast of the state. The Nordpunkt has located the only 100&nbsp;km to the south of the North Sea coast. The deepest natural dip is arranged in the district Zyfflich in the city of [[Kranenburg, North Rhine-Westphalia|Kranenburg]] with 9.2 m above sea level in the northwest of the state. Though, the deepest point overground results from mining. The open-pit Hambach reaches at [[Niederzier]] a deep of 293 m below sea level. At the same time, this is the deepest human-made dip in Germany.

The most important rivers flowing at least partially through North Rhine-Westphalia include: the [[Rhine]], the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]], the [[Ems (river)|Ems]], the [[Lippe River|Lippe]], and the [[Weser]]. The Rhine is by far the most important river in North Rhine-Westphalia: it enters the state as [[Middle Rhine]] near Bad Honnef, where still being part of the [[Mittelrhein (wine region)|Mittelrhein wine region]]. It changes into the [[Lower Rhine]] near Bad Godesberg and leaves North Rhine-Westphalia near Emmerich at a width of 730 metres. Almost immediately after entering the Netherlands, the Rhine splits into many branches.

The [[Pader (river)|Pader]], which flows entirely within the city of [[Paderborn]], is considered Germany's shortest river.

For many, North Rhine-Westphalia is synonymous with industrial areas and urban agglomerations. However, the largest part of the state is used for agriculture (almost 52%) and forests (25%).<ref>Tatsachen über Deutschland (2003) ''Nordrhein-Westfalen'', p.&nbsp;44</ref>

The state consists of five [[Regierungsbezirk|government regions]] (''Regierungsbezirke''), divided into 31 districts (''[[Districts of Germany|Kreise]]'') and 23 [[Urban districts of Germany|urban districts]] (''kreisfreie Städte''). In total, North Rhine-Westphalia has 396 municipalities (1997), including the urban districts, which are municipalities by themselves. The government regions have an assembly elected by the districts and municipalities, while the ''Landschaftsverband'' has a directly elected assembly.

The five government regions of North Rhine-Westphalia each belong to one of the two ''[[States of Germany#Area associations (Landschaftsverbände)|Landschaftsverbände]]'':

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of North Rhine-Westphalia}}
[[File:Duesseldorf 1932Kopie.jpg|thumb|[[Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia|Landtag]] in [[Düsseldorf]]]]

The politics of North Rhine-Westphalia takes place within a framework of a [[Federal republic|federal]] [[parliamentary]] [[representative democratic]] republic. The two main parties are, as on the federal level, the centre-right [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and the centre-left [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]]. From 1966 to 2005, North Rhine-Westphalia was continuously governed by the Social Democrats or SPD-led governments.

The state's legislative body is the [[Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia|Landtag]] ("state parliament house").<ref name="NRWPolitcs">{{cite web|title=The Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia|url=http://www.landtag.nrw.de/portal/WWW/GB_II/II.1/OeA/International/en/en.jsp#a1|publisher=[[Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia]]|access-date=11 April 2011|archive-date=29 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629061849/http://www.landtag.nrw.de/portal/WWW/GB_II/II.1/OeA/International/en/en.jsp#a1|url-status=dead}}</ref> It may pass laws within the competency of the state, e.g. cultural matters, the education system, matters of internal security, i.e. the police, building supervision, health supervision and the media; as opposed to matters that are reserved to Federal law.<ref name="NRWPolitcs"/>

North Rhine-Westphalia uses the same electoral system as the Federal level in Germany: "''[[mixed member proportional representation|Personalized proportional representation]]''". Every five years the citizens of North Rhine-Westphalia vote in a general election to elect at least 181 members of the Landtag. Only parties who win at least 5% of the votes cast may be represented in parliament.<ref name="NRWPolitcs"/>

The Landtag, the parliamentary parties and groups consisting of at least 7 members of parliament have the right to table legal proposals to the Landtag for deliberation.<ref name="NRWPolitcs"/> The law that is passed by the Landtag is delivered to the Minister-President, who, together with the ministers involved, is required to sign it and announce it in the Law and Ordinance Gazette.<ref name="NRWPolitcs"/>

==Economy==

[[File:Thyssen-Krupp-Quartier-Teilansicht-Essen-2013.jpg|thumb|right|[[ThyssenKrupp]] headquarters in [[Essen]]]]
North Rhine-Westphalia has always been Germany's powerhouse with the largest economy among the [[List of German states by GDP|German states by GDP figures]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=Eric|title=Germany – German Powerhouse|url=https://www.land.nrw/en/economy-north-rhine-westphalia|access-date=7 March 2021|website=NRW}}</ref>

In the 1950s and 1960s, Westphalia was known as ''Land von Kohle und Stahl'' (''Land of Coal and Steel''). In the post-World War II recovery, the [[Ruhr]] was one of the most important industrial regions in Europe, and contributed to the German [[Wirtschaftswunder]]. As of the late 1960s, repeated crises led to contractions of these industrial branches. On the other hand, producing sectors, particularly in mechanical engineering and metal and iron working industry, experienced substantial growth. Despite this structural change and an economic growth which was under national average, the 2018 GDP of 705 billion euro (1/4 of the total German GDP) made NRW the economically strongest state of Germany [[List of German states by GRP|by GRP figures]], as well as one of the most important economical areas in the world.<ref>[http://www.wirtschaft.nrw.de/witelegramm/indikatoren/wachstum/index.php Ministerium für Wirtschaft, Mittelstand und Energie des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen: ''Konjunkturindikatoren NRW''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20070813225024/http://www.wirtschaft.nrw.de/witelegramm/indikatoren/wachstum/index.php |date=13 August 2007 }}</ref> Of Germany's top 100 corporations, 37 are based in North Rhine-Westphalia.

North Rhine-Westphalia attracts companies from both Germany and abroad. In 2009, the state had the most foreign direct investments ([[Foreign direct investment|FDI]]) anywhere in Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neweuropeaneconomy.com/business_info/FDI/ |title=FDI |publisher=New European Economy |access-date=29 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004194431/http://www.neweuropeaneconomy.com/business_info/FDI/ |archive-date=4 October 2011}}</ref> Around 13,100 foreign companies from the most important investment countries control their German or European operations from bases in North Rhine-Westphalia.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Economy and Innovation |url=https://www.wirtschaft.nrw/en/economy-and-innovation |access-date=2023-12-12 |website=www.wirtschaft.nrw |language=en}}</ref>

There have been many changes in the state's economy in recent times. Among the many changes in the economy, employment in the creative industries is up while the mining sector is employing fewer people.<ref name="CultureNRW"/> [[Industrial heritage|Industrial heritage sites]] are now workplaces for designers, artists and the advertising industry.<ref name="CultureNRW"/><ref>{{cite news|author=Staff Reporter|title=Opening times of shops in Germany|url=https://www.oeffnungszeiten.com/|access-date=23 June 2017|work=www.oeffnungszeiten.com|agency=oeffnungszeiten|language=de}}</ref> The [[Ruhr]] region has – since the 1960s – undergone a significant structural change away from coal mining and steel industry.

== Transport ==

With its central location in the [[Blue Banana|most important European economic area]], high population density, strong urbanization and numerous business locations, North Rhine-Westphalia has one of the densest transport networks in the world.

=== Regional rail network ===
[[File:VRR Linien-Netz 2014.jpg|thumb|Transportsystem Rhein-Ruhr in 2014]]
[[Image:Einfahrt Stadtbahn U46 in U-Bahnhof Saarlandstraße.JPG|thumb|Stadtbahn in [[Dortmund]]]]
The regional rail network is organised around the big cities on the Rhine and Ruhr such as [[Cologne]], [[Düsseldorf]] and [[Dortmund]]. The public transport companies in the Ruhr area and Düsseldorf are run under the umbrella of the [[Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr]], which provides a uniform ticket system valid for the area. The region of Cologne and Bonn is run under the [[Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Sieg]]. There is also a ticketing system called ''NRW-Tarif'' which offers tickets between all the regions of North Rhine-Westphalia. The state is well-integrated into the national rail system, the {{Lang|de|[[Deutsche Bahn]]|italic=no}}, for both passenger and goods services, each city in the region has at least one or more train stations. The bigger central stations have frequent direct connections to most bigger German cities and European cities such as [[Amsterdam]], [[Brussels]], [[Paris]] and [[Basel]]. Some direct trains run to [[Vienna]] and [[Zürich]].

The Rhein-Ruhr area also contains some of the longest [[tram]] system in the world, with tram and [[Stadtbahn]] services from [[Witten]] to [[Krefeld]] in the VRR zone and [[Cologne]] to [[Bad Honnef]] and [[Siegburg]] via [[Bonn]] within the VRS zone. Besides the local public transportation there is an interconnected commuter rail network, with the [[Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn]] network serving the Ruhr area as well as Düsseldorf and the [[S-Bahn Köln]] serving the area around Cologne.

{{As of|2012}}, the VRR network alone consists of 978 lines,<ref name="net-report">{{cite web |url=http://www.vrr.de/blaetterkatalog/Verbundbericht_2013_RZ/blaetterkatalog/ |title=Verbundbericht 2012/2013 als Blätterkatalog |publisher=Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (VRR) |language=de |trans-title=Network Report 2012/2013 as a Page-by-page Catalog |page=107 |access-date=23 October 2013 |archive-date=5 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705172134/http://www.vrr.de/blaetterkatalog/Verbundbericht_2013_RZ/blaetterkatalog/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> of which there are:

===Road===
[[Image:A40-Ruhrschnellweg-Huttrop.jpg|thumb|Autobahn A40 in Essen]]
North Rhine-Westphalia has the densest network of [[German Autobahnen|Autobahns in Germany]] and similar Schnellstraßen (expressways). The Autobahn network is built in a grid network, with five east–west ([[Bundesautobahn 2|A2]], [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]], [[Bundesautobahn 40|A40]], [[Bundesautobahn 42|A42]], [[Bundesautobahn 44|A44]]) and eight north–south ([[Bundesautobahn 1|A1]], [[Bundesautobahn 3|A3]], [[Bundesautobahn 43|A43]], [[Bundesautobahn 45|A45]], [[Bundesautobahn 52|A52]], [[Bundesautobahn 57|A57]], [[Bundesautobahn 59|A59]], [[Bundesautobahn 61|A61]]) routes. The A1, A2, A3, A4 and A61 are mostly used by through traffic, while the other autobahns have a more regional function.

Both the A44 and the A52 have several missing links, in various stages of planning. Some missing sections are currently in construction or planned to be constructed in the near future.

Additional expressways serve as bypasses and local routes, especially around Dortmund and Bochum. Due to the density of the autobahns and expressways, [[Bundesstraße]]n are less important for intercity traffic. The first Autobahns in the Region opened during the mid-1930s. Due to the density of the network, and the number of alternative routes, traffic volumes are generally lower than other major metropolitan areas in Europe. Traffic congestion is an everyday occurrence, but far less so than in the [[Randstad]] in the Netherlands, another polycentric urban area. Most important Autobahns have six lanes.

=== Airports ===
The region benefits from the presence of several airport infrastructure. The main airport is [[Düsseldorf Airport]], world class, which hosted 25.5 million passengers in 2019 and offers flights to various international destinations. Düsseldorf is the fourth-largest airport in Germany after [[Frankfurt Airport|Frankfurt]], [[Munich Airport|Munich]] and [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport|Berlin]] and serves as a [[airline hub|hub]] for [[Eurowings]] and as focus city for several more airlines. The airport has three passenger terminals and two runways and can handle wide-body aircraft up to the [[Airbus A380]].<ref name="a380ready">{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.de/flughafen-duesseldorf-a380/35850|title=Flughafen Düsseldorf schließt Bauarbeiten für A380 ab|access-date=11 December 2016}}</ref>

The second airport is the [[international airport]] of [[Germany]]'s fourth-largest city [[Cologne]], and also serves [[Bonn]], former capital of [[West Germany]]. With around 10 million passengers passing through it in 2023, it is the sixth-largest passenger airport in Germany and the third-largest in terms of cargo operations. It is also a hub for Eurowings, but also for some cargo airlines. By traffic units, which combines cargo and passengers, the airport is in fifth position in Germany.<ref>{{cite web |title=ADV Monthly Traffic Report |date=November 2015 |publisher=Flughafenverband |url=http://www.adv.aero/fileadmin/pdf/statistiken/2015/11.2015_ADV-Monatsstatistik.pdf |access-date=6 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304204205/http://www.adv.aero/fileadmin/pdf/statistiken/2015/11.2015_ADV-Monatsstatistik.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 }}</ref> As of March 2015, Cologne Bonn Airport had services to 115 passenger destinations in 35 countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.de/sommerflugplan-2015-sieben-ziele-flughafen-koeln-bonn/35295|title=Sommerflugplan 2015: Sieben neue Ziele ab Flughafen Köln/Bonn|work=airliners.de|access-date=4 June 2015}}</ref> It is named after [[Konrad Adenauer]], a Cologne native and the first post-war Chancellor of West Germany.

Third airport in the region, [[Dortmund Airport]] is a minor [[international airport]] located {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Dortmund]]. It serves the eastern [[Rhine-Ruhr|Rhine-Ruhr area]], the largest [[urban agglomeration]] in [[Germany]], and is mainly used for low-cost and leisure charter flights. In 2019 the airport served 2,719,563 passengers.

There are three more minor airports within the state: [[Münster Osnabrück Airport]], [[Airport Weeze]] and [[Paderborn Lippstadt Airport]].

===Waterways===
The [[Rhine]] flows through North Rhine-Westphalia. Its banks are usually heavily populated and industrialized, in particular the [[agglomerations]] [[Cologne]], [[Düsseldorf]] and [[Ruhr area]]. Here the Rhine flows through the largest conurbation in Germany, the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] region. [[Duisburg Inner Harbour]] (Duisport) and [[Dortmund Port]] are large industrial inland ports and serve as hubs along the Rhine and the German inland water transport system. The country is crossed by many canals like [[Rhine–Herne Canal]] (RHK), der [[Wesel-Datteln-Kanal]] (WDK), der [[Datteln-Hamm-Kanal]] (DHK) and [[Dortmund-Ems-Kanal]] (DEK) an important role for inland navigation.
