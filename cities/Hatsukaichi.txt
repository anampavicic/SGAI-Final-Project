==History==
The area of Hatsukaichi is part of ancient [[Aki Province]].  [[Itsukushima Shrine]] developed greatly at the end of the [[Heian period]] under the patronage of [[Taira no Kiyomori]] and gained influence in the region. As the shrine was occasionally destroyed by fire or natural disasters, the [[Kamakura shogunate]], ordered many metal casters moved to the area on the opposite bank (present-day Honmachi, Hatsukaichi City), and the accumulation of living and rebuilding materials such as salt and wood began. Since the last day of the festival held four times a year at Itsukushima Shrine was the 20th, a market began to be held on the 20th of each month as early as the middle of the Kamakura period, and the market on the 20th is called 'Hatsukaichi'. This name appears in official documents from 1454, and since this period, Hatsukaichi has developed as a port and a timber industry town based on the collection of timber from the western Chugoku Mountains. During the [[Edo Period]], the area was part of the holdings of [[Hiroshima Domain]]. Following the [[Meiji restoration]], the town of Hatsukaichi was established within  [[Saeki District, Hiroshima]] on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. Hatsukaichi merged with four neighboring villages to become the city of Hatsukaichi on April 1, 1988.

On March 1, 2003, the town of [[Saeki, Hiroshima|Saeki]] and the village of [[Yoshiwa, Hiroshima|Yoshiwa]], both from [[Saeki District, Hiroshima|Saeki District]], merged into the expanded city of Hatsukaichi. On November 3, 2005, the towns of [[Miyajima, Hiroshima|Miyajima]] and [[Ōno, Hiroshima|Ōno]] (both from [[Saeki District, Hiroshima|Saeki District]]) were merged into Hatsukaichi. Therefore, [[Saeki District, Hiroshima|Saeki District]] was dissolved as a result of this merger.

==Government==
Hatsukaichi has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 28 members. Hatsukaichi contributes two members to the Hiroshima Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Hiroshima 2nd district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Hatsukaichi is one of the cities that make up the Hiroshima metropolitan area, and was formerly an industrial city noted for its timber industry, wood processing and food processing, as well as [[commercial fishing]]. It is increasing a [[commuter town]] for neighboring Hiroshima. However, after the mergers of 2003 and 2005, the city gained a large agricultural hinterland, as well as the major tourist attraction of Itsukushima Shrine.

==Education==
Hatsukaichi has 16 public elementary schools and seven public junior high schools operated by the city government, and four public high schools operated by the Hiroshima Prefectural Board of Education. There is also one private high school. The prefecture also operates one special education school for the handicapped. [[The Japanese Red Cross Hiroshima College of Nursing]] and [[Sanyo Women's College]] are located in Hatsukaichi.
