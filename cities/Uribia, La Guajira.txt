'''Uribia''' is a town and municipality of the [[La Guajira department]] of [[Colombia]]. It is the youngest municipality of this Department since the year 2000. Northern Zone of the [[Cerrejón]] [[coal]] mines are located in this municipality. The municipality also contains the [[Serranía de Macuira]] mountain range which is an isolated low altitude mountain range in the middle of [[La Guajira Desert]]. One third of this mountain range is also a National Natural Park of Colombia.

==Geography and climate==
[[Image:Geography map of Uribia, La Guajira.png|thumb|left|200px|The municipality of Uribia within La Guajira including main roads and villages.]]

The Municipality of Uribia covers most of the northern area of the [[Guajira Peninsula]], the northernmost part of South America. Uribia borders to the north and west with the Caribbean Sea which surround more than half the municipality; to the east Uribia has a short border with the [[Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela]]; to the south its borders the municipality of [[Maicao]] and southwest the municipality of [[Riohacha]].

The Upper Guajira is arid, presenting clay formations with scarce vegetation of cactus and other [[xerophile]]s. The [[Serranía de Macuira]] lies in the middle of the upper region presenting three predominant hills {{convert|650|m|ft|-1}} or more above sea level in the Macuira, Jarará and La Teta.<ref>[http://www.todacolombia.com/departamentos/laguajira.html {{in lang|es}} todacolombia.com: La Guajira]</ref>

Uribia has an [[arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BWh'') owing to its extremely hot temperatures that average around {{convert|30|C|F}} on most days of the year. Rainfall averages around {{convert|360|mm|in|0}} per year but even in the “wet” months of May, September, October and November it does not reach the level of potential evaporation. Humidity is generally high enough to make the consistent heat very uncomfortable.

==History==
===Evangelization===

The process of [[evangelization]]s of the Wayuu people restarted in 1887 with the return of the [[Capuchin friars]] under reverend friar José María de Valdeviejas. In 1905, [[Pope Pius X]] created the [[Vicariate]] of La Guajira and as first Vicar, friar Atanasio Vicente Soler y Royo in an attempt to "civilize" the Wayuu people.<ref name="lablaa.org">[http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/modosycostumbres/gumv/gumv07.htm {{in lang|es}} Luis Angel Arango Library: The Capuchins mission and the Wayuu Culture]</ref>

The friars the created the orphanages for Wayuu children beginning with the La Sierrita orphanage built in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountains in 1903; followed by the San Antonio orphanage in 1910 located by the [[Calancala River]], Nazareth orphanage in the Serrania de Macuira mountains in 1913 creating a direct influence over the [[Ranchería]]s of Guarrachal, El Pájaro, Carazúa, Guaraguao, Murumana, Garra patamana and Karraipía. While Nazareth had some control over the rancherías of Taroa, Maguaipa, Guaseipá and Alpanapause. The friars constantly visited the settlements inviting to attend mass. Wayuu children in the orphanage were educated with traditional European customs. Conflicts between the Wayuu people and the Colombian government decreased since then. In 1942 the village of Uribia celebrated for the first time Christmas and New Year's Eve.<ref name="lablaa.org"/>

===Official foundation===

[[Image:Foundation of Uribia, La Guajira 1935.png|thumb|right|200px|Captain Eduardo Londoño and Cacique Bartola González founded Uribia, with the presence of the Capuchin friars. (1935)]]

Uribia was founded officially on March 1, 1935 by Captain Eduardo Londoño Villegas in honor of [[Colombian Liberal Party]] leader [[Rafael Uribe Uribe]], prior to this the village was named ''Chitki'' in [[Wayuu language]]. The main plaza was created and named after [[Francisco de Paula Santander]] one of the leaders of the Colombian independence from Spain.<ref>[http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/modosycostumbres/gumv/gumv06.htm {{in lang|es}} Luis Angel Arango Library: Foundation of Uribia]</ref>

===Capital of the Special Commissary of La Guajira===

Uribia became a regional capital town of the Special Commissary of La Guajira until 1954, when the National Intendency of La Guajira was created and the capital transferred to [[Riohacha]].<ref>[http://www.banrep.gov.co/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/sept2001/ciudades.htm {{in lang|es}} Revista Credencial Historia. (Bogotá - Colombia). Edition 141 of September, 2001: Foundation of Colombian cities and towns]</ref>

==Culture==

{{see also|List of festivals in La Guajira}}

Uribia is predominantly inhabited by indigenous peoples pertaining to the [[Wayuu]] ethnic group. Cultural activities are directly related to them. The town celebrates the "Festival of the Wayuu Culture" from May 31 to June 1 every year.<ref>[http://www.sinic.gov.co/SINIC/ColombiaCultural/ColCulturalBusca.aspx?AREID=3&SECID=8&IdDep=44&COLTEM=215 {{in lang|es}} National System for Cultural Information: Festival of the Wayuu Culture]</ref>
