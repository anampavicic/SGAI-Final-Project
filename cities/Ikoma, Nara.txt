== History ==
The city area is described in the [[Nihon Shoki|Nihon shoki]], the second-oldest Chronicles of Japan, and had been a small village outside [[Heijō-kyō|Heijo-kyo]], one of the former capitals of Japan.

From [[Muromachi period]], chasen production began in Takayama region, the northern part of the city. Chasen is a tool used to make Japanese tea in the tea ceremony.

In [[Edo period|Edo Period]], [[Hōzan-ji|Hozan-ji]] temple was built on the mountainside in the and the nearby area came to  grow as gateway town for the temple. [[Imperial House of Japan|Imperial House]] and [[Tokugawa shoguns]]  visited there for worship.

After the difficult construction of Ikoma-tunnel, which penetrates Mount Ikoma, [[Kintetsu Nara Line|railway]] to Osaka and Nara service begun operating. [[Ikoma Cable Line]] from [[Toriimae Station]], near the Ikoma Station, to [[Hōzanji Station|Hozanji Station]] and [[Ikoma-Sanjō Station|Ikoma-sanjyō Station]] opened for business. Also [[Ikoma Line|the train]] bound for foot of  [[Mount Shigi]] and [[Ōji Station (Nara)|Oji station]] from Ikoma station. Thereafter   around Hozan-ji and the midtown, which nearby the station  have expanded.

After municipal incorporation of two towns to Ikoma-town, the town  was elevated to city status on 1 November 1971.

Takayama region, located in northern area, began to develop as one part of  [[Kansai Science City]], then  [[Nara Institute of Science and Technology]] and many  private research and development facilities are built.

[[Keihanna Line|Higashi Osaka line]] connecting to [[Osaka Metro Chūō Line]] has been extended to Ikoma Station,  thereby providing two routes into Osaka City.

The northern area has been developing into residential district, as a high-end residential area, and In 2006 Higashi Osaka Line was extended to this area and renamed the [[Keihanna Line]].

This city is faced with a declining birthrate and aging population, like most municipalities in Japan and with tendency to return to the big city center like Osaka city, yet it is developing as an environmentally advanced city, as superior residential city.
