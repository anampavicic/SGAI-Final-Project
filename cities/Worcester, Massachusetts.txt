Worcester is about {{convert|40|mi|km}} west of Boston, {{convert|50|mi|km}} east of [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], and {{convert|40|mi|km}} north-northwest of [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]. Because it is near the geographic center of Massachusetts, Worcester is known as the "Heart of the Commonwealth"; a heart is the official symbol of the city. Worcester is the historical [[county seat|seat]] of [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester County]].

Worcester developed as an industrial city in the 19th century because the [[Blackstone Canal]] and railways facilitated the import of raw materials and the export of such finished goods as machines, textiles, and wire. Many European immigrants made up the city's growing population. After [[World War II]], manufacturing there waned; economic and population decline was not reversed until the 1990s, when higher education, medicine, [[biotechnology]], and new immigrants started making their mark. The population has grown by 28% since 1980, reaching its all-time high in the 2020 census and effecting [[urban renewal]].

Modern Worcester is known for its diversity and large immigrant population, with significant communities of [[Vietnamese Americans|Vietnamese]], [[Brazilian Americans|Brazilians]], [[Albanian Americans|Albanians]], [[Stateside Puerto Ricans|Puerto Ricans]], [[Ghanaian Americans|Ghanaians]], [[Dominican Americans|Dominicans]], and others.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Welker|first=Grant|date=2018-11-12|title=Coming to Worcester: The city's immigrant population has shifted in the last decade|url=https://www.wbjournal.com/article/coming-to-worcester-the-citys-immigrant-population-has-shifted-in-the-last-decade|access-date=2021-03-21|website=Worcester Business Journal|language=en-US}}</ref> Twenty-two percent of Worcester's population was born outside the United States.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=Welker|first=Grant|date=2018-11-12|title=City of Immigrants: Foreign-born residents have unusually large impact on Worcester's economy|url=https://www.wbjournal.com/article/city-of-immigrants-foreign-born-residents-have-unusually-large-impact-on-worcesters-economy|access-date=2021-03-21|website=Worcester Business Journal|language=en-US}}</ref> A center of higher education, it is home to eight colleges and universities, including the [[College of the Holy Cross]], [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] (WPI), and [[Clark University]].

Worcester is the principal city of [[Central Massachusetts]], and is a regional hub of government, industry, and transportation hub. Since the 1970s, and especially since the construction of [[Massachusetts Route 146|Route 146]] and interstates [[Massachusetts Turnpike|90]], [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|495]], [[Interstate 190 (Massachusetts)|190]], [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|290]], and [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut–Massachusetts)|395]], both Worcester and its surrounding towns have become more integrated with Boston's suburbs. The Worcester region now marks the western periphery of the Boston–Worcester–Providence (MA–RI–NH) U.S. Census [[Combined Statistical Area]] (CSA), or [[Greater Boston]].

==History==
{{For timeline}}

===Colonial era===
The area was inhabited by members of the [[Nipmuc]] tribe at the time of European contact. The native people called the region ''Quinsigamond'' and built a settlement on Pakachoag Hill in [[Auburn, Massachusetts|Auburn]].<ref>Lincoln, William (1862). ''History of Worcester, Massachusetts'', pp. 22–23. Worcester: Charles Hersey.</ref>

In 1673, English settlers [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]] and [[Daniel Gookin]] led an expedition to Quinsigamond to establish a new Christian Indian [[praying town]] and identify a new location for an English settlement. On July 13, 1674, Gookin obtained a deed to eight square miles of land in Quinsigamond from the Nipmuc people and English traders and settlers began to inhabit the region.<ref name=Indian>{{cite web|title=Hassanamisco Indian Museum History|publisher=Hassanamisco Indian Museum|year=2013|url=http://nipmucmuseum.org/history|access-date=December 30, 2013|archive-date=August 23, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823080037/http://nipmucmuseum.org/history|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1675, [[King Philip's War]] broke out throughout New England with the Nipmuc Indians coming to the aid of Indian leader [[Metacomet|King Philip]]. The English settlers completely abandoned the Quinsigamond area and the empty buildings were burned by the Indian forces. The town was again abandoned during [[Queen Anne's War]] in 1702.<ref name="Indian" />

Finally, in 1713, Worcester was permanently resettled for a third and final time by [[Jonas Rice]].<ref name="WSA">Worcester Society of Antiquity (1903). ''Exercises Held at the Dedication of a Memorial to Major Jonas Rice, the First Permanent Settler of Worcester, Massachusetts, Wednesday, October 7, 1903.''

On April 2, 1731, Worcester was chosen as the county seat of the newly founded [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester County]] government. Between 1755 and 1758, future U.S. president [[John Adams]] worked as a schoolteacher and studied law in Worcester.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Our History |website= Worcester County Bar Association |url=https://www.worcestercountybar.org/our-history/ |access-date=2023-12-19 |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2016-10-04 |title=John Adams: Life Before the Presidency |url=https://millercenter.org/president/adams/life-before-the-presidency |first1=C.

Worcester also had a role in the start of the [[American Revolution]], with an event that is oft-forgotten. On September 6, 1774, 4,622 militiamen from 37 towns in Worcester County assembled and marched on Main Street, Worcester; they sought to shut down the Crown's court before it could sit for a new session. The event was dubbed the [[Worcester Revolt|Worcester Revolution]], or the Worcester Revolt. Having seized the courthouse, the militiamen waited for the 25 appointees from the Crown to arrive, where they were denied entry and later forced to disavow their appointments by King George III. Bloodshed and violence was avoided, with not a shot fired. British authority had been demonstrably overthrown in the American colonies for the first time.<ref>{{cite news

===Growth and industry===

[[File:The Star on the Sidewalk, Worcester, Massachusetts.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=Star on the sidewalk marking where the Declaration of Independence was first read |The Star on the Sidewalk indicates the spot of the first reading in New England of the Declaration of Independence in 1776.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Coombs|first1=Zelotes W.|title=Worcester & Worcester Common|url=http://www.worcesterma.gov/city-clerk/history/general/worcester-common|website=City of Worcester, Massachusetts|access-date=February 9, 2015|archive-date=February 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209075855/http://www.worcesterma.gov/city-clerk/history/general/worcester-common|url-status=live}}</ref>]]

In the 1770s, Worcester became a center of [[American Revolution|American revolutionary]] activity. The [[Worcester Revolt]] on September 6, 1774, was an early successful attempt to throw off British rule. British [[General Thomas Gage]] was given information of patriot ammunition stockpiled in Worcester in 1775. That same year, ''[[Massachusetts Spy]]'' publisher [[Isaiah Thomas (publisher)|Isaiah Thomas]] moved his radical newspaper out of British occupied [[Boston]] to Worcester. Thomas would continuously publish his paper throughout the [[American Revolutionary War]]. On July 14, 1776, Thomas performed the first public reading in Massachusetts of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] from the porch of the Old South Church,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hutchins|first1=Fred L.|title=Fixing the Spot|journal=Proceedings of the Worcester Society of Antiquity|date=1899|volume=16|page=88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1gZFAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA88}}</ref> where the 19th-century Worcester City Hall stands today. He would later go on to form the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in Worcester in 1812.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/media/factsheet.doc|title=American Antiquarian Society Fact Sheet|access-date=April 25, 2013|archive-date=April 18, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418163449/http://www.americanantiquarian.org/media/factsheet.doc|url-status=live}}</ref>

During the turn of the 19th century, Worcester's economy moved into manufacturing. Factories producing textiles, shoes and clothing opened along the nearby [[Blackstone River]].

However, the manufacturing industry in Worcester would not begin to thrive until the opening of the [[Blackstone Canal]] in 1828 and the opening of the [[Boston and Albany Railroad|Worcester and Boston Railroad]] in 1835. The city transformed into a transportation hub and the manufacturing industry flourished.<ref name=trains>{{cite web|title=Transportation|publisher=Worcester Historical Museum|year=2013|url=http://www.worcesterhistory.org/worcesters-history/worcester-in-the-19th-century/transportation/|access-date=December 30, 2013|archive-date=December 31, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231003441/http://www.worcesterhistory.org/worcesters-history/worcester-in-the-19th-century/transportation/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Worcester was officially chartered as a city on February 29, 1848.<ref name="City of Worcester, Massachusetts"/> The city's industries soon attracted immigrants of primarily Irish, Scottish, French, German, and Swedish descent in the mid-19th century and later many immigrants of Lithuanian, Polish, Italian, Greek, Turkish, Armenian, Syrian, and Lebanese descent.<ref name=Washburn />  Immigrants moved into new [[Three-decker (house)|three-decker]] houses (which originated in Worcester) <ref name="Charles Nutt p. 473">Charles Nutt, ''History of Worcester and its people'', pg. 473</ref> lining hundreds of Worcester's expanding streets and neighborhoods.<ref>{{cite web|title=Three Deckers|publisher=Worcester Historical Museum|year=2013|url=http://www.worcesterhistory.org/worcesters-history/worcesters-own/three-deckers/|access-date=December 30, 2013|archive-date=December 31, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231010235/http://www.worcesterhistory.org/worcesters-history/worcesters-own/three-deckers/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1831, [[Ichabod Washburn]] opened the [[Washburn & Moen Company]]. The company would become the largest wire manufacturing in the country and Washburn became one of the leading industrial and philanthropic figures in the city.<ref name=Washburn>{{cite web|title=Washburn and Moen Worcester's Worldwide Wire Manufacturuer|author1=Dan Ricciardi|author2=Kathryn Mahoney|publisher=College of the Holy Cross|year=2013|url=http://college.holycross.edu/projects/worcester/immigration/northworks.htm|access-date=December 30, 2013|archive-date=June 29, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629051540/http://college.holycross.edu/projects/worcester/immigration/northworks.htm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Worcester, MA Driving Tour & Guide to Blackstone Canal Historic Markers|url=http://www.nps.gov/blac/home.htm|access-date=July 23, 2007|archive-date=February 4, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204124242/http://www.nps.gov/blac/home.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

Worcester would become a center of machinery, wire products and power looms and boasted large manufacturers, including Washburn & Moen, [[Wyman-Gordon]] Company, American Steel & Wire, Morgan Construction and the [[Norton Company]]. In 1908, the [[Royal Worcester Corset Company]] was the largest employer of women in the United States.<ref>Gaultney, Bruce (2009). ''Worcester Memories'', pg. 21.
</ref>

Worcester would also claim many inventions and firsts. New England [[Candlepin bowling]] was invented in Worcester by Justin White in 1879. [[Esther Howland]] began the first line of [[Valentine's Day]] cards from her Worcester home in 1847. [[Loring Coes]] invented the first [[monkey wrench]] and Russell Hawes created the first envelope folding machine.<ref name=1880s>Gaultney, Bruce (2009).

===Urban changes and recovery===
After World War II, Worcester began to fall into decline as the city lost its manufacturing base to cheaper alternatives across the country and overseas. Worcester felt the national trends of movement away from historic urban centers. The city's population dropped over 20% from 1950 to 1980. In the mid-20th century, large [[urban renewal]] projects were undertaken to try to reverse the city's decline. A huge area of downtown Worcester was demolished for new office towers and the {{Convert|1,000,000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} [[Worcester Center Galleria]] shopping mall.<ref name=Mall>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegram.com/apps/pbcs.dll/gallery?Site=WT&Date=20040520&Category=MALL&ArtNo=520001&Ref=PH&Params=Itemnr=1|title=City Square Slideshow|date=December 30, 2013|work=Worcester Telegram & Gazette|access-date=December 30, 2013|archive-date=December 31, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231053235/http://www.telegram.com/apps/pbcs.dll/gallery?Site=WT&Date=20040520&Category=MALL&ArtNo=520001&Ref=PH&Params=Itemnr=1|url-status=live}}</ref> After only 30 years, the Galleria would lose most of its major tenants and its appeal to more suburban shopping malls around Worcester County.

On June 9, 1953, an [[Fujita scale|F4]] tornado touched down in [[Petersham, Massachusetts|Petersham]], northwest of Worcester. The tornado tore through {{convert|48|mi|km}} of Worcester County including a large area of the city of Worcester. The tornado left massive destruction and killed 94 people.

Worcester has become home to many refugees in recent years. The city has successfully resettled over 2,000 refugees coming from over 24 countries. Today, most of these refugees come from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Iraq]], [[Somalia]], [[Bhutan]], [[Syria]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Afghanistan]].<ref>Fabos, A.,&nbsp;Pilgrim, M., Said-Ali, M., Krahe, J.,&nbsp;Ostiller, Z. 2015.

==Geography==

Worcester has a total area of {{convert|38.6|sqmi|km2}}: {{convert|37.6|sqmi|km2}} of land and {{convert|1.0|sqmi|km2}}, comprising roughly 2.59%, of water. Worcester is bordered by the towns of [[Auburn, Massachusetts|Auburn]], [[Grafton, Massachusetts|Grafton]], [[Holden, Massachusetts|Holden]], [[Leicester, Massachusetts|Leicester]], [[Millbury, Massachusetts|Millbury]], [[Paxton, Massachusetts|Paxton]], [[Shrewsbury, Massachusetts|Shrewsbury]], and [[West Boylston, Massachusetts|West Boylston]].

Worcester is known as the "Heart of the Commonwealth" because of its proximity to the center of Massachusetts. The city is about {{convert|40|mi|km}} west of [[Boston]], {{convert|50|mi|km}} east of [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], and {{convert|38|mi|km}} northwest of [[Providence, Rhode Island]].

The [[Blackstone River]] forms in the center of Worcester by the confluence of the Middle River and Mill Brook. The river courses underground through the center of the city, and emerges at the foot of College Hill. It then flows south through Quinsigamond Village and into Millbury. Worcester is the beginning of the [[Blackstone Valley]] that frames the river. The [[Blackstone Canal]] was once an important waterway connecting Worcester to Providence and the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]], but the canal fell into disuse at the end of the 19th century and was mostly covered up. In recent years, local organizations, including the Canal District Business Association, have proposed restoring the canal and creating a Blackstone Valley [[National Park]].<ref name=blackstone>{{cite news|first=Steven|last=Jones-D'Agostino|title=Worcester's Canal District Banks On National Park Designation|url=http://www.golocalworcester.com/news/canal-district-boosters-push-for-national-historic-park/|publisher=GoLocalWorcester|date=September 3, 2013|access-date=January 2, 2014|archive-date=January 3, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103141222/http://www.golocalworcester.com/news/canal-district-boosters-push-for-national-historic-park/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Worcester is one of many cities claimed, like [[Rome]], [[List of cities claimed to be built on seven hills|to be found on seven hills]]: Airport Hill, Bancroft Hill, Belmont Hill (Bell Hill), [[Grafton Hill]], Green Hill, Pakachoag Hill and Vernon Hill. However, Worcester has more than seven hills, examples of which include Indian Hill, Newton Hill, Poet's Hill, and Wigwam Hill.

Worcester has many ponds and two prominent lakes: [[Indian Lake (Massachusetts)|Indian Lake]] and [[Lake Quinsigamond]]. Lake Quinsigamond (also known as Long Pond) stretches {{Convert|4|mi|km|spell=in}} across the Worcester and Shrewsbury border and is a very popular [[rowing (sport)|competitive rowing]] and boating destination.

===Climate===
Worcester's [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dfb'') is typical of [[New England]]. The weather changes rapidly owing to the confluence of warm, humid air from the southwest; cool, dry air from the north; and the moderating influence of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the east. Summers are typically hot and humid, while winters are cold, windy, and snowy. Snow typically falls from the second half of November into early April,<ref name = NOAA/> with occasional falls in October; May snow is much rarer. The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] classifies the city as straddling [[hardiness zone]]s 5b and 6a.<ref>{{cite web |title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map |author=United States Department of Agriculture |publisher=[[United States National Arboretum]] |url=http://www.usna.usda.gov/Hardzone/hzm-ne1.html |accessdate=February 19, 2015 |authorlink=United States Department of Agriculture |archive-date=March 3, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303152208/http://www.usna.usda.gov/Hardzone/hzm-ne1.html }}</ref>

The hottest month is July, with a 24-hour average of {{convert|70.2|°F|1}}, while the coldest is January, at {{convert|24.1|°F|1}}. There are an average of only 3.5 days of highs at or above {{convert|90|°F|0}} and 4.1 nights of lows at or below {{convert|0|°F|0}} per year, and periods of either extremes are rarely sustained. The all-time record high temperature is {{convert|102|°F|0}}, recorded on July 4, 1911,<ref>{{cite web

Worcester is known for being particularly snowy in the cold months, sometimes even experiencing intense autumn blizzards. The city averages {{convert|48.07|in|mm|sigfig=3}} of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] a year, as well as an average of {{convert|64|in|cm}} of snowfall a season,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Weather averages Worcester, Massachusetts |url=https://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/worcester/massachusetts/united-states/usma0502 |access-date=2023-12-19 |website=www.usclimatedata.com |language=en}}</ref> receiving far more snow than coastal locations less than {{convert|40|mi|km}} away.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sami |first=Isabel |title=Why Worcester gets more snow than most |url=https://www.telegram.com/story/news/2021/02/01/storm-central-heres-why-worcester-gets-more-snow-than-most/4340701001/ |access-date=2023-12-19 |website=The Worcester Telegram & Gazette |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Weather averages Boston, Massachusetts |url=https://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/boston/massachusetts/united-states/usma0046 |access-date=2023-12-19 |website=www.usclimatedata.com |language=en}}</ref> Massachusetts' geographic location, jutting out into the [[North Atlantic]], as well as Worcester's elevation relative to the surrounding terrain, makes the city very prone to [[Nor'easter]] weather systems that can dump heavy snow on the region. Extreme winters have brought up to {{Convert|120|in|cm}} of snowfall, as happened in 2005. In late January 2015, a blizzard traversed over the city as it shed almost {{Convert|32|in|cm}} of snow.

While rare, the city has had its share of extreme weather. On September 21, 1938, the city was hit by the brutal [[New England Hurricane of 1938]]. Fifteen years later, Worcester was hit by a [[1953 Worcester tornado|tornado]] that killed 94 people. The deadliest tornado in New England history, it damaged a large part of the city and surrounding towns. It struck [[Assumption Preparatory School]], now the site of [[Quinsigamond Community College]].

Worcester is governed by a [[council–manager government]], with a popularly elected [[mayor]]. A [[city council]] acts as the legislative body, and the council-appointed manager handles the traditional day-to-day chief executive functions.

City councilors can run as either a representative of a city district or as an at-large candidate. The winning at-large candidate who receives the greatest number of votes for mayor becomes the mayor (at-large councilor candidates must ask to be removed from the ballot for mayor if they do not want to be listed on the mayoral ballot). As a result, voters must vote for their mayoral candidate twice, once as an at-large councilor, and once as the mayor. The mayor has no more authority than other city councilors, but is the ceremonial head of the city and chair of the city council and school committee. Currently, there are 11 councilors: 6 at-large and 5 district.

Worcester's first [[charter]], which went into effect in 1848, established a Mayor/[[Bicameralism|Bicameral]] form of government. Together, the two chambers—the 11-member Board of [[alderman|Aldermen]] and the 30-member Common Council—were vested with complete legislative powers. The mayor handled all administrative departments, though appointments to those departments had to be approved by the two-chamber City Council.

Seeking to replace the 1848 charter, Worcester voters in November 1947 approved a change to [[Government of Massachusetts#Form of government: city vs. town|Plan E municipal government]]. In effect from January 1949 until November 1985, this charter (as outlined in chapter 43 of the Massachusetts General Laws) established City Council/City Manager government. This type of governance, with modifications, has survived to the present day.

Initially, Plan E government in Worcester was organized as a 9-member council (all at-large), a ceremonial mayor elected from the council by the councilors, and a council-appointed city manager. The manager oversees the daily administration of the city, makes all appointments to city offices, and can be removed at any time by a majority vote of the council. The mayor chairs the city council and the school committee, and does not have the power to veto any vote.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wrrb.org/reports/99-2charterq.pdf | title=Considering Worcester's Charter | date=April 20, 1999 | publisher=Worcester Regional Research Bureau | access-date=June 17, 2004|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070616175906/http://www.wrrb.org/reports/99-2charterq.pdf |archive-date = June 16, 2007}}</ref>

From 1949 through 1959, elections were by the [[single transferable vote]]. Voters repealed that system in November 1960. Despite [[Nonpartisanism|non-partisan]] elections, two groups alternated in control of council: the local Democratic Party and a [[Slate (elections)|slate]] known as the Citizens' Plan E Association (CEA). CEA members included the Republican Party leadership and other groups not affiliated with the regular Democratic Party.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Santucci|first=Jack|date=April 2018|title=Evidence of a winning-cohesion tradeoff under multi-winner ranked-choice voting|journal=Electoral Studies|volume=52|pages=128–138|doi=10.1016/j.electstud.2017.11.003|issn=0261-3794|url=http://osf.io/qjtwn/|access-date=November 24, 2018|archive-date=November 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201113170459/https://osf.io/qjtwn/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1983, Worcester voters again decided to change the city charter. This "Home Rule" charter (named for the method of adoption of the charter) is similar to Plan E, the major changes being to the structure of the council and the election of the mayor. The 9-member Council became 11, 6 at-large and 1 from each city district. The mayor is chosen by popular election, but must also run and win as an at-large councilor.

Worcester's history of [[social progressivism]] includes a number of [[temperance movement in Massachusetts|temperance]] and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movements. It was a leader in the [[women's suffrage]] movement: The first national convention advocating women's rights was held in Worcester on October 23–24, 1850.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.worcesterma.gov/city-clerk/history | title=Worcester, MA History | publisher=City of Worcester, Massachusetts | year=2007 | access-date=March 3, 2007 | archive-date=March 4, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304224655/http://www.worcesterma.gov/city-clerk/history | url-status=live }}</ref>

Two of the nation's most radical abolitionists, [[Abby Kelley|Abby Kelley Foster]] and her husband Stephen S. Foster, adopted Worcester as their home, as did [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]], the editor of ''The Atlantic Monthly'' and [[Emily Dickinson]]'s avuncular correspondent, and Unitarian minister Rev. [[Edward Everett Hale]].

The area was already home to [[Lucy Stone]], [[Eli Thayer]], and [[Samuel May Jr]]. They were joined in their political activities by networks of related Quaker families such as the Earles and the Chases, whose organizing efforts were crucial to the anti-slavery cause in central Massachusetts and throughout New England.

Anarchist [[Emma Goldman]] and two others opened an ice cream shop in 1892. "It was spring and not yet warm," Goldman later wrote, "but the coffee I brewed, our sandwiches, and dainty dishes were beginning to be appreciated. Within a short time, we were able to invest in a soda-water fountain and some lovely colored dishes."<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/goldman/peopleevents/p_frick.html American Experience | Emma Goldman | People & Events] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712130323/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/goldman/peopleevents/p_frick.html |date=July 12, 2015 }}.

On October 19, 1924, the largest gathering of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) ever held in New England took place at the Agricultural Fairgrounds in Worcester. Klansmen in sheets and hoods, new Knights awaiting a mass induction ceremony, and supporters swelled the crowd to 15,000. The KKK had hired more than 400 "husky guards", but when the rally ended around midnight, a riot broke out. Klansmen's cars were stoned and burned, and their windows smashed. KKK members were pulled from their cars and beaten. Klansmen called for police protection, but the situation raged out of control for most of the night. The violence after the "Klanvocation" had the desired effect: Membership fell off, and no further public Klan meetings were held in Worcester.<ref name="klanvocation">{{cite web|title=Ku Klux Clan Rallies in Worcester: October 19, 1924|url=http://massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=302|website=Mass Moments| date=August 27, 2007 |access-date=June 21, 2017|archive-date=October 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004160748/http://massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=302|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Economy==
By the mid-19th century, Worcester was one of New England's largest manufacturing centers. The city's large industries specialized in machinery, wire production, and power looms. Although manufacturing has declined, the city still maintains large manufactures, like [[Norton Abrasives]], which was bought by [[Saint-Gobain]] in 1990, Morgan Construction Company, since bought by Siemens and then bought by Japanese company PriMetals Technologies, and the David Clark Company. The [[David Clark Company]] pioneered aeronautical equipment including anti-gravity suits and noise attenuating headsets.

Services, particularly education and healthcare, make up a large portion of the city's economy. Worcester's many colleges and universities make higher education a considerable presence in the city's economy.

Much of Worcester's culture is synonymous with broader [[New England]] culture. The city's name is notoriously mispronounced by people unfamiliar with the city. As with the city in England, the first syllable of "cester" (''castra'') is left entirely unvoiced. Combined with a traditionally [[non-rhotic]] [[Eastern New England English]] accent, the name can be transcribed as "WOOS-tuh" or "WISS-tuh" (the first syllable possibly having a [[near-close central unrounded vowel]]).<ref name="Holy Cross"/>

Worcester has many traditionally ethnic neighborhoods, including Quinsigamond Village (Swedish), Shrewsbury Street (Italian), [[Kelley Square]] (Irish and Polish), Vernon Hill (Lithuanian), Union Hill (Jewish), and Main South (Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Vietnamese).

Due to its location in [[Central Massachusetts]], Worcester is known as the "Heart of the Commonwealth"; a heart is the official symbol of the city. However, the heart symbol may also have its provenance in lore that the Valentine's Day card, although not invented in the city, was first [[Mass production|mass-produced]] and popularized by Worcester resident [[Esther Howland]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Valentines weren't invented in Worcester, but they have special history here|url=http://www.telegram.com/article/20130708/NEWS/307089987/1101|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201113170441/https://www.telegram.com/article/20130708/NEWS/307089987/1101|archive-date=November 13, 2020|access-date=June 29, 2014}}</ref> Similarly, the invention of the classic yellow "smiley face" design by Worcester native Harvey Ball has gained it an iconic status in the city.

==Religion==
[[File:Trinity Lutheran Church (Worcester, Massachusetts).jpg|thumb|Trinity Lutheran Church]]
According to the U.S. Religion Census 2010, most inhabitants of Worcester County report no religious affiliation. Following None, the largest reported religious denomination is Catholicism. The first Catholics came to Worcester in 1826. They were chiefly Irish immigrants brought to America by the builders of the Blackstone canal. As time went on and the number of Catholics increased, the community petitioned Bishop Fenwick to send them a priest. In response to this appeal, the bishop appointed the Reverend James Fitton to visit the Catholics of Worcester in 1834. A Catholic Mass was first offered in the city in an old stone building on Front Street. The foundation of Christ's Church, the first Catholic church in Worcester (now St. John's), was laid on July 6, 1834.<ref>F.P. Rice "The Worcester of 1898"</ref> The Roman Catholic Diocese of Worcester was canonically erected on January 14, 1950, by Pope Pius XII.
