{{Wikivoyage|London (Ontario)}}
'''London''' is a city in [[southwestern Ontario]], Canada, along the [[Quebec City–Windsor Corridor]]. The city had a population of 422,324 according to the [[2021 Canadian census]]. London is at the confluence of the [[Thames River (Ontario)|Thames River]] and North Thames River, approximately {{convert|200|km|abbr=on}} from both [[Toronto]] and [[Detroit]]; and about {{convert|230|km|abbr=on}} from [[Buffalo, New York]]. The city of London is [[List of Ontario separated municipalities|politically separate]] from [[Middlesex County, Ontario|Middlesex County]], though it remains the county seat.

London and the [[Thames River (Ontario)|Thames]] were named after the [[London|English city]] and [[River Thames|river]] in 1793 by [[John Graves Simcoe]], who proposed the site for the capital city of [[Upper Canada]]. The first European settlement was between 1801 and 1804 by Peter Hagerman.<ref>{{cite book|author=St-Denis, Guy|title=Byron:Pioneer Days in Westminster Township|publisher=Crinklaw Press|year=1985|isbn=0-919939-10-4|pages=21–22}}</ref> The village was founded in 1826 and [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] in 1855. Since then, London has grown to be the largest southwestern Ontario municipality and Canada's [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|11th largest metropolitan area]], having annexed many of the smaller communities that surround it.

London is a regional centre of healthcare and education, being home to the [[University of Western Ontario]] (which brands itself "Western University"), [[Fanshawe College]], and three major hospitals: [[Victoria Hospital (London, Ontario)|Victoria Hospital]], [[University Hospital (London, Ontario)|University Hospital]] and St. Joseph's Hospital. The city hosts a number of musical and artistic exhibits and festivals, which contribute to its tourism industry, but its economic activity is centered on [[education]], [[medical research]], [[manufacturing]], [[financial services]], and [[information technology]]. London's university and hospitals are among its top ten employers. London lies at the junction of [[Ontario Highway 401|Highways 401]] and [[Ontario Highway 402|402]], connecting it to [[Toronto]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], and [[Sarnia]]. These highways also make the [[Detroit–Windsor|Detroit-Windsor]], [[Port Huron–Sarnia Border Crossing|Port Huron-Sarnia]], and [[Rainbow Bridge (Niagara Falls)|Niagara Falls]] border crossings with the United States easily accessible. The city also has railway stations and bus stations and is home to the [[London International Airport]].

=== Settlement ===

The current location of London was selected as the site of the future capital of [[Upper Canada]] in 1793 by [[Lieutenant governor|Lieutenant-Governor]] [[John Graves Simcoe]], who also named the village which was founded in 1826.<ref name="lon">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2LAEAQAAIAAJ&q=%22named+after+london%22%22London,+Ontario+%22 |title=Canada: wonderland of surprises |author1=Max Braithwaite |publisher=Dodd, Mead |year=1967 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101234739/https://books.google.com/books?id=2LAEAQAAIAAJ&q=%22named+after+london%22%22London,+Ontario+%22&dq=%22named+after+london%22%22London,+Ontario+%22 |archive-date=1 January 2016 }}</ref> Originally, Simcoe had proposed to call it ''Georgiana'', in honour of [[George III]], the reigning monarch at that time.<ref>{{Cite book |title=City of London, Ontario, Canada.

Rather, it was an administrative seat for the area west of the actual capital, [[York, Upper Canada|York]] (now Toronto).

London was part of the [[Talbot Settlement]], named for Colonel [[Thomas Talbot (Upper Canada)|Thomas Talbot]], the chief administrator of the area, who oversaw the land surveying and built the first government buildings for the administration of the western Ontario peninsular region. Together with the rest of southwestern Ontario, the village benefited from Talbot's provisions not only for building and maintaining roads but also for assignment of access priorities to main routes to productive land.<ref name="begin">{{cite web| url=http://www.london.ca/d.aspx?s=/About_London/london_history.htm| title=The beginnings| year=2009| publisher=City of London| access-date=24 September 2009| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125160114/http://london.ca/d.aspx?s=%2FAbout_London%2Flondon_history.htm| archive-date=25 November 2010}}</ref> Crown and [[clergy reserve]]s then received preference in the rest of Ontario.

[[John Carling]], Tory MP for London, gave three events to explain the development of London in a 1901 speech: the location of the court and administration in London in 1826, the arrival of the military garrison in 1838, and the arrival of the railway in 1853.<ref name=lutman>{{cite book| last=Lutman| first=John| title=The Historic Heart of London| publisher=Corporation of the City of London| year=1977| page=6}}</ref>  

The population in 1846 was 3,500. Brick buildings included a jail and court house, and large barracks. London had a fire company, a theatre, a large Gothic church, nine other churches or chapels, and two market buildings. The buildings that were destroyed by fire in 1845 were mostly rebuilt by 1846. Connection with other communities was by road, using mainly [[stagecoach]]es that ran daily. A weekly newspaper was published and mail was received daily by the post office.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

Long before the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] was established in 1876, there were proposals for military colleges in Canada. Staffed by British Regulars, adult male students underwent three-month-long military courses from 1865 at the School of Military Instruction in London. Established by Militia General Order in 1865, the school enabled Officers of Militia or Candidates for Commission or promotion in the Militia to learn Military duties, drill and discipline, to command a Company at Battalion Drill, to Drill a Company at Company Drill, the internal economy of a Company and the duties of a Company's Officer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~theislands/photos6/ansonkeillmilcert.jpg|title=RootsWeb.com Home Page|website=freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407162844/http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~theislands/photos6/ansonkeillmilcert.jpg|archive-date=7 April 2016|access-date=7 June 2016}}</ref> The school was not retained at Confederation, in 1867.<ref>Richard Preston 'Canada's RMC: A History of the Royal Military College of Canada' published by the RMC Club by U of Toronto Press.</ref>

That community joined with the southern subdivision of Kensington in 1874, formally incorporating as the municipality of Petersville. Although it changed its name in 1880 to the more inclusive "London West", it remained a separate municipality until ratepayers voted for amalgamation with London in 1897,<ref name="begin" /> largely due to repeated flooding.

London's role as a military centre continued into the 20th century during the two World Wars, serving as the administrative centre for the Western Ontario district. In 1905, the London Armoury was built and housed the First Hussars until 1975. A private investor purchased the historic site and built a new hotel (Delta London Armouries, 1996) in its place, preserving the shell of the historic building. In the 1950s, two reserve battalions amalgamated and became [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|London and Oxford Rifles (3rd Battalion), The Royal Canadian Regiment]].<ref name="dnd">{{cite web| url=http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/land-terre/units-unites/index-eng.asp?action=City&id=39&rid=267#267| title=London, Ontario| publisher=Department of National Defence| access-date=25 September 2009| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610202021/http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/land-terre/units-unites/index-eng.asp?action=City&id=39&rid=267#267| archive-date=10 June 2011}}</ref> This unit continues to serve today as 4th Battalion, [[The Royal Canadian Regiment]].

=== Annexation to present ===
London [[Municipal annexation|annexed]] many of the surrounding communities in 1961, including [[Byron, Ontario|Byron]] and Masonville, adding 60,000 people and more than doubling its area.<ref name="begin" /> After this amalgamation, suburban growth accelerated as London grew outward in all directions, creating expansive new subdivisions such as Westmount, Oakridge, Whitehills, Pond Mills, White Oaks and Stoneybrook.<ref name="begin" />

On 1 January 1993, London annexed nearly the entire township of [[Westminster, Middlesex County, Ontario|Westminster]], a large, primarily [[rural municipality]] directly south of the city, including the [[police village]] of [[Lambeth, Middlesex County, Ontario|Lambeth]].<ref name="timeline10">{{cite web| url=http://www.london.ca/About-London/london-history/Pages/1977-to-2000.aspx| title=History of London – 1977 to 2000| publisher=City of London| access-date=21 January 2015| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121143624/http://www.london.ca/About-London/london-history/Pages/1977-to-2000.aspx| archive-date=21 January 2015}}</ref> With this massive annexation, which also included part of [[London Township, Ontario|London township]], London almost doubled in area again, adding several thousand more residents.

===Disasters===
On [[Victoria Day]], 24 May 1881, the [[stern-wheeler]] ferry ''SS Victoria'' capsized in the [[Thames River (Ontario)|Thames River]] close to Cove Bridge in West London. Approximately 200 passengers drowned in the shallow river, making it one of the worst disasters in London's history, and is now dubbed "[[Victoria steamboat disaster|The Victoria Day Disaster]]". At the time, London's population was relatively low; therefore it was hard to find a person in the city who did not have a family member affected by the tragedy.

Two years later, on 12 July 1883,<ref name="timeline2" /> the first of the two most devastating floods in London's history killed 17 people.

=== Climate ===
London has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb''), with modestly warm summers, and cold and cloudy winters with frequent snow. 

Because of its location in the continent, London experiences large [[seasonal]] contrast, tempered to a point by the surrounding [[Great Lakes]]. The proximity of the lakes also ensure abundant cloud cover, particularly in late Fall and Winter. The summers are usually warm to hot and humid, with a July average of {{convert|21.0|C|1}}, and temperatures above {{cvt|30|C}} occur on average 11 days per year.<ref name=CCN1991/> In 2016, however, temperatures rose above this temperature on more than 35 days, and in 2018, four heatwaves led to a peak [[humidex]] of {{cvt|46|C}}. The city is affected by frequent thunderstorms due to hot, humid summer weather, as well as the [[Convergence zone|convergence of breezes]] originating from [[Lake Huron]] and [[Lake Erie]]. The same convergence zone is responsible for spawning funnel clouds and the occasional tornado. Spring and autumn in between are not long, and winters are cold but with frequent thaws.

London's city centre mall was first opened in 1960 as Wellington Square with {{cvt|400,000|sqft}} of leasable area, with Eaton's and Woolworths as anchors. From 1986 to 1989, Campeau expanded Wellington Square into Galleria London with {{cvt|1,000,000|sqft}} of leasable area and 200 stores including The Bay and Eaton's. However, the early 1990s recession, following by the bankruptcy of Eaton's in 1999 and then the departure of The Bay in 2000 resulted in only 20 stores left by 2001. Galleria London then began seeking non-retail tenants, becoming the home for London's [[London Public Library|central library]] branch, and satellite campuses for both [[Fanshawe College]] and [[University of Western Ontario|Western University]]. The complex was purchased and renamed to Citi Plaza by [[Citigroup]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reurbanist.com/2012/06/the-transformation-of-galleria-london/|title=The Transformation of Galleria London – Reurbanist|website=reurbanist.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402150838/http://reurbanist.com/2012/06/the-transformation-of-galleria-london/|archive-date=2 April 2015|access-date=2 May 2017}}</ref> Citi Plaza has been redeveloped as a mixed use complex that blends retail, office, businesses, and education providers.

London's [[Local government|municipal government]] is divided among fourteen [[councillor]]s (one representing each of London's fourteen [[ward (politics)|wards]]) and the [[mayor]]. [[Josh Morgan (politician)|Josh Morgan]] was elected mayor in the [[2022 London, Ontario municipal election|2022 municipal election]]. Until the elections in 2010, there was a [[Board of Control (municipal government)|Board of Control]], consisting of four controllers and the mayor, all elected citywide.<ref name="council">{{cite web| url=http://www.london.ca/d.aspx?s=/City_Council/default.htm| title=Your December 2006 – November 2010 Council| year=2006| publisher=City of London| access-date=27 September 2009| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125123613/http://london.ca/d.aspx?s=%2FCity_Council%2Fdefault.htm| archive-date=25 November 2010}}</ref>

London was the first city in Canada (in May 2017) to decide to move a [[Instant-runoff voting|ranked choice ballot]] for municipal elections starting in 2018. Voters mark their ballots in order of preference, ranking their top three favourite candidates. An individual must reach 50 per cent of the total to be declared elected; in each round of counting where a candidate has not yet reached that target, the person with the fewest votes is dropped from the ballot and their second or third choice preferences reallocated to the remaining candidates, with this process repeating until a candidate has reached 50 per cent.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/london-ranked-ballot-1.4095014 "London, Ont., votes to become 1st Canadian city to use ranked ballots"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503090057/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/london-ranked-ballot-1.4095014 |date=3 May 2017 }}. [[CBC News]] Windsor, 2 May 2017.</ref>

In 2001, the City of London first published their Facilities Accessibility Design Standards (FADS) which was one of the first North American municipal [[accessibility]] requirements to include [[Universal Design]]. It has since been adopted by over 50 municipalities in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.london.ca/city-hall/accessibility/Pages/Facilities-Accessibility-Design-Standards.aspx| title=Facilities Accessibility Design Standards (FADS)| year=2016| publisher=City of London Ontario| access-date=20 August 2016| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621174137/http://www.london.ca/city-hall/accessibility/Pages/Facilities-Accessibility-Design-Standards.aspx| archive-date=21 June 2016}}</ref>

Research by [[Michael Andrew Arntfield]], a police officer turned criminology professor, has determined that on a per-capita basis, London had more active [[serial killers]] than any locale in the world from 1959 to 1984.<ref>Michael Arntfield (2018). Murder City: The Untold Story of Canada's Serial Killer Capital, 1959-1984. FriesenPress</ref> Arntfield determined there were at least six serial killers active in London during this era.

On 6 June 2021, the [[2021 London, Ontario truck attack|London, Ontario truck attack]] took place in the North West of the city. Four members of a Canadian Muslim family, two women aged 74 and 44, a 46-year-old man and a 15-year-old girl were all killed by a pickup truck, which jumped the curb and ran them over. The sole survivor was a 9-year-old boy. According to the London Police Service, they were deliberately targeted in anti-Islamic hate crime. Later on the same day, 20-year-old Nathaniel Veltman was arrested in the parking lot of a nearby mall. He was charged with four counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2021-06-08|title=Muslim family in Canada killed in 'premeditated' truck attack|language=en-GB|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57390398|access-date=2021-07-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Austen|first=Ian|date=2021-06-09|title=As a Family Is Mourned, Canada Grapples With Anti-Muslim Bias|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/09/world/canada/muslim-family-london.html|access-date=2021-07-03|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

[[File:Veterans Memorial Parkway, London, Ontario.jpg|thumb|Intersection along the [[Veterans Memorial Parkway]], an at-grade [[limited-access road|expressway]]]]
Since the 1970s, London has improved urban road alignments that eliminated "jogs" in established traffic patterns over 19th-century street misalignments. The lack of [[freeways]] directly through the city as well as the presence of two significant railways (each with attendant switching yards and few over/underpasses) are the primary causes of [[rush hour]] congestion, along with construction and heavy snow. Thus, traffic times can be significantly variable, although major traffic jams are rare.<ref name="master">{{cite web| url=http://www.london.ca/city-hall/master-plans-reports/master-plans/Documents/Transportation%20Master%20Plan.pdf| title=Transportation Master Plan| date=May 2013| publisher=City of London| pages=2–23| access-date=17 December 2013| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217221358/http://www.london.ca/city-hall/master-plans-reports/master-plans/Documents/Transportation%20Master%20Plan.pdf| archive-date=17 December 2013}}</ref> Wellington Road between Commissioners Road E and Southdale Road E is London's busiest section of roadway, with more than 46,000 vehicles using the span on an average day<ref name=volume>{{cite web| title=City of London Traffic Volume Data| author=City of London| date=2013| url=http://www.london.ca/residents/Roads-Transportation/traffic-management/Pages/Traffic-Volumes.aspx| access-date=26 October 2011| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217221612/http://www.london.ca/residents/Roads-Transportation/traffic-management/Pages/Traffic-Volumes.aspx| archive-date=17 December 2013}}</ref> City council rejected early plans for the construction of a freeway, and instead accepted the [[Veterans Memorial Parkway]] to serve the east end.<ref name="long-term">{{cite web|title=Long-Term Transportation Corridor Protection Study |publisher=City of London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130913040755/http://london.ca/d.aspx?s=%2FTransportation%2Fcorridorstudy.htm |archive-date=13 September 2013 |url=http://london.ca/d.aspx?s=/Transportation/corridorstudy.htm |access-date=17 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Some Londoners have expressed concern the absence of a local freeway may hinder London's economic and population growth, while others have voiced concern such a freeway would destroy environmentally sensitive areas and contribute to London's suburban sprawl.<ref name="master" /> Road capacity improvements have been made to Veterans Memorial Parkway (formerly named Airport Road and [[Highway 100 (Ontario)|Highway 100]]) in the industrialized east end.<ref name=401images>{{cite web| archive-date=7 August 2007| title=King's Highway 401 – Images| last=Steeves| first=Scott| year=2004| url=http://www.onthighways.com/hwy_401_images/Hwy401_p4_images.htm| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807234534/http://onthighways.com/hwy_401_images/Hwy401_p4_images.htm| access-date=28 September 2009}}</ref> However, the Parkway has received criticism for not being built as a proper highway; a study conducted in 2007 suggested upgrading it by replacing the intersections with interchanges.<ref name=veterans07>{{cite web| title=Veterans Memorial Parkway| year=2007| publisher=City of London| url=http://www.london.ca/residents/Environment/EAs/Documents/VMP-PicBoard2.pdf| access-date=17 December 2013| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217224349/http://www.london.ca/residents/Environment/EAs/Documents/VMP-PicBoard2.pdf| archive-date=17 December 2013}}</ref>

Additional cycleways are planned for integration in road-widening projects, where there is need and sufficient space along routes. An [[limited-access road|expressway]]/freeway network is possible along the eastern and western ends of the city, from [[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]] (and [[Ontario Highway 402|Highway 402]] for the western route) past Oxford Street, potentially with another highway, joining the two in the city's north end.<ref name="master"/>

The city of London has assessed the entire length of the Veterans Memorial Parkway, identifying areas where interchanges can be constructed, grade separations can occur, and where [[cul-de-sac]]s can be placed. Upon completion, the Veterans Memorial Parkway would no longer be an expressway, but a freeway, for the majority of its length.<ref>{{cite web| title= Veterans Memorial Parkway Interchange Class Environmental Assessment Study and Concurrent Application to Amend the Official Plan and Zoning By-Law| author= City of London and Giffels| date= 13 December 2007| url= http://www.london.ca/residents/Environment/EAs/Documents/VMP-PicBoard2.pdf| access-date= 17 December 2013| url-status= dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131217224349/http://www.london.ca/residents/Environment/EAs/Documents/VMP-PicBoard2.pdf| archive-date= 17 December 2013}}</ref>
