'''Michoacán''', formally '''Michoacán de Ocampo''' ({{IPA|es|mitʃoaˈkan de oˈkampo|-|ES-pe - Michoacán de Ocampo.ogg}}; [[Purépecha language|Purépecha]]: {{lang|pua|P'uɽempo}}), officially the '''Estado Libre y Soberano de Michoacán de Ocampo''' {{gloss|Free and Sovereign State of Michoacán de Ocampo}}, is one of the 31 states which, together with [[Mexico City]], comprise the [[Political divisions of Mexico|Federal Entities]] of [[Mexico]]. The state is divided into 113 [[Municipalities of Michoacán|municipalities]] and its capital city is [[Morelia]] (formerly called Valladolid). The city was named after [[José María Morelos]], a native of the city and one of the main heroes of the [[Mexican War of Independence]].

Michoacán is located in western Mexico, and has a stretch of coastline on the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the southwest. It is bordered by the states of [[Colima]] and [[Jalisco]] to the west and northwest, [[Guanajuato]] to the north, [[Querétaro]] to the northeast, [[State of Mexico|the State of México]] to the east, and [[Guerrero]] to the southeast.

The name Michoacán is from [[Nahuatl]]: ''Michhuahcān'' {{IPA-nah|mit͡ʃˈwaʔkaːn|}} from ''michhuah'' {{IPA-nah|ˈmit͡ʃwaʔ|}} {{gloss|possessor of fish}} and ''-cān'' {{IPA-nah|kaːn|}} {{gloss|place of}} and means "place of the fishermen", referring to those who fish on [[Lake Pátzcuaro]].<ref name="introduccion">{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.mx/mich/mich-intro.html |title=El Estado de Michoacán Introduccion |publisher=UMSNH |location=Morelia, Michoacán |language=es |trans-title=The State of Michoacan Introduction |access-date=June 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719163442/http://www.umich.mx/mich/mich-intro.html |archive-date=July 19, 2011}}</ref> In pre-Hispanic times, the area was the home of the [[Purépecha Empire]], which rivaled the [[Aztec Empire]] at the time of Spanish encounter. After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest]], the empire became a separate province which became smaller over the colonial period. The state and its residents played a major role in the [[Mexican War of Independence]].

Today, the state is still home to a sizable population of [[Purépecha people]] as well as minor populations of [[Otomi people|Otomi]] and [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]]. 
The economy is based on agriculture, ranching, fishing, mining, and the arts. The major tourism draw for the state is the [[Lake Pátzcuaro]]–Tzintzuntzan–Quiroga area, which was the center of the [[Tarascan state|Purépecha Empire]]; as well as the location of the Tzintzuntzan yácata pyramids.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cartwright |first1=Mark |title=Tarascan Civilization |url=https://www.worldhistory.org/Tarascan_Civilization/ |website=[[World History Encyclopedia]] |access-date=April 16, 2020 |archive-date=May 13, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210513211436/https://www.worldhistory.org/Tarascan_Civilization/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The national and state parks which include the winter grounds of the monarch butterflies ''([[Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve|Mariposas Monarca]])'' are located here.

According to archaeological evidence, there has been human habitation within the territory of the Mexican state of Michoacán for at least 10,000 years.<ref name="elochis">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_michoacan |title=Historia |year=2009 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Michoacán |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=History |access-date=June 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517162648/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_Michoacan |archive-date=May 17, 2011}}</ref> In the pre-Hispanic period, there were waves of migration into the area, including the Pirinda, [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]], Huetamo, Colima, [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]] and other peoples.<ref name="prehis">{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.mx/mich/historia/prehisp.html |title=El Estado de Michoacán Epoca Prehispanica |publisher=UMSNH |location=Morelia, Michoacán |language=es |trans-title=The State of Michoacan Pre-Hispanic Era |access-date=June 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124211111/http://www.umich.mx/mich/historia/prehisp.html |archive-date=January 24, 2010}}</ref> There are sites of formal settlements from all Mesoamerican periods. Important sites include [[El Opeño]] and those in [[Curutarán]], [[Tepalcatepec]], [[Apatzingán]], [[Zinapécuaro]] and [[Coalcomán de Vázquez Pallares|Coalcomán]].

[[File:Aztec_Indians_Mexico_Tlaxcalan_Cortez.jpg|thumb|left|Spanish-Tlaxcalan conquest of Michoacan under [[conquistador]] [[Nuño de Guzmán]]]]
The main pre-Hispanic civilization of the state is that of the Purépecha, which was centered in the Lake Pátzcuaro area.<ref name="elochis"/> Before the 13th century, both Nahua and Purépecha peoples were here, sustaining themselves by agriculture and fishing. The Purépecha are descendants of a late arrival of [[Chichimeca]] who came from the north. At Lake Patzcuaro, they came upon people with similar cultures to their own but who were more technological and socially advanced. The formation of the Purépechan state in the 13th century, when these people started their own dominion at Uayameo, today [[Santa Fé de la Laguna]], and becoming dominant over the entire Lake Patzcuaro area by the 15th century. Conquest of neighboring tribes and territories occurred between 1401 and 1450, as they absorbed peoples with different cultures and languages into the empire. By the late 15th century, this state rivaled that of the Aztecs, having expanded their territory over much of what is now Michoacán and into part of [[Colima]], [[Nayarit]], [[Querétaro]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Guerrero]] and [[Jalisco]]. The Aztecs attempted to invade the Purépecha but were repelled. Because of this attack, the Purépecha later denied the Aztecs aid in their defense of [[Tenochtitlan]] against the Spanish and the Tlaxcala. The Purépechas are noted by historians to be one of the few rare instances in the Americas were the indigenous people had some experience with [[metallurgy]] prior to the arrival of the Europeans, especially [[coppersmithing]] and other metal ores located in their empire. Their descendants are still widely regarded for this today.<ref name="elochis"/><ref name="prehis"/>
[[File:Tarascan Coyote Statuette.jpg|thumb|left|Purépecha coyote statue]]
Prior to the arrival of any Spaniard in the territory, then-ruler [[Zuanga]] died of [[smallpox]], presumably carried by one of the Aztec delegations seeking military aid. He was succeeded by [[Tanganxoan II]]. The first Spaniard to the area was [[Cristóbal de Olid]]. The Spanish destruction of Tenochtitlan and their promise to allow him to remain ruler convinced Tanganxoan II to submit to Spanish rule. But, [[Nuño de Guzmán]] reneged on this agreement and killed Tanganxoan II in 1530, a crime for which he was tried and exiled to Spain where he would die in prison.<ref name="elochis"/><ref name="hiscolonial">{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.mx/mich/historia/colonia.html |title=El Estado de Michoacán Epoca Colonial |publisher=UMSNH |location=Morelia, Michoacán |language=es |trans-title=The State of Michoacan Colonial Era |access-date=June 16, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302161902/http://www.umich.mx/mich/historia/colonia.html |archive-date=March 2, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

During the first years of the Conquest, Michoacán was part of the "kingdom of Mexico" which included the current states of Mexico, Querétaro, [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], [[Tlaxcala]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Morelos]], Guerrero, [[Veracruz]], [[Tabasco]], Michoacán, [[Guanajuato]] and parts of [[San Luis Potosí]], Jalisco and Colima. These lands were divided into [[encomienda]]s among the [[conquistador]]s. The provinces with the largest populations were called Alcaldias Mayores, with Michoacán being one of these, with its capital initially at [[Tzintzuntzan, Michoacán|Tzintzuntzan]]. Soon after, it was moved to Patzcuaro and eventually settled in what is now Morelia. The provincial and later state capital was founded by [[viceroy]] [[Antonio de Mendoza]] in 1541. It became the political and ecclesiastical center of the province after the death of [[Vasco de Quiroga]] in 1565.<ref name="elochis"/>

Soon after the Spanish Conquest, evangelists from the [[Franciscan]], [[Augustinians|Augustinian]], [[Carmelite]] and other orders established monasteries all over the territory. Some of the best-known are [[Juan de Moya]], [[Martín de la Coruña]] and [[Jacob the Dacian]]. As first governor, Nuño de Guzmán disrupted and devastated the social and economic order of the area. Vasco de Quiroga succeeded Guzman, bringing Franciscan and Augustinian friars to both evangelize and repair the area's broken economy and social institutions. Quiroga founded the Spanish city of Patzcuaro in 1538, calling it the Ciudad de Mechuacán.<ref name="elochis"/> For his efforts, Quiroga is still referred to in the Patzcuaro area as "Tata (grandfather) Vasco".<ref name="hiscolonial"/> The diocese of Michoacán was established in 1536 by [[Pope Paul III]], and its boundaries coincide with the old [[Purépecha kingdom]]. Its first bishop was Vasco de Quiroga.<ref name="cathenc">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10282a.htm |title=Archdiocese of Michoacan |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |access-date=June 16, 2010 |archive-date=June 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615171317/http://newadvent.org/cathen/10282a.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo]] began as the Colegio de San Nicolas Obispo, founded by Vasco de Quiroga in Patzcuaro in 1540. It was originally a seminary for the training of evangelists. It was granted a royal seal in 1543 to become the Real Colegio de San Nicolás Obispo. The school was moved to Morelia in 1580 and was fused with the Colegio de San Miguel Guayangareo. In 1590, its name was changed to the Seminario Tridentino, afterwards to Seminario Conciliar in 1601. By the end of the 17th century, the name returned to Colegio de San Nicolás but its structure was profoundly changed, adding studies such as philosophy, civil law, and others. At the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries, a number of figures associated with the Mexican War of Independence, such as Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, José María Morelos and others were associated with this school. By the mid-19th century, the school had been secularized and renamed the Primitivo y Nacional Colegio de San Nicolás de Hidalgo adding studies such as chemistry, physics and other sciences. The current name and organization was adopted after the Mexican Revolution in 1917.<ref name="umich">{{cite web |last=Zamudio |first=Silvia Figueroa |url=http://www.umich.mx/Historia.html |title=Historia Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolas de Hidalgo |publisher=UMSNH |location=Michoacán |language=es |trans-title=History of the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolas de Hidalgo |access-date=June 16, 2010 |archive-date=April 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415205122/http://www.umich.mx/Historia.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

From the 16th to the 18th centuries, Augustinian, Franciscan and Carmelite missions were constructed in the territory as well as civil constructions, especially in the city now known as Morelia. Mining in areas such as [[Angangueo]], [[Tlalpujahua]] and [[Inguaran]] had begun, as well as the establishment of agricultural and livestock [[haciendas]]. The first school of higher education, called the Primera Casa de Altos Estudios en América, was founded by Alonso de la Veracruz in [[Tiripetío]].<ref name="hiscolonial"/> Michoacán was made a separate province from "Mexico" in 1602. By the mid-17th century, the indigenous population had declined by half. In 1776, the territory of Michoacán was reduced to the area in which the modern states of Michoacán and Colima are now. Soon after, Colima split to join with the province of Guadalajara, leaving Michoacán roughly with the territory it has today.<ref name="elochis"/>

During the entire colonial period, the economy was concentrated in the hands of the Spanish-born, who held vast lands and haciendas. They also held the rights over minerals mined in places such as Tlalpujahua, Angangueo and [[Huetamo]]. Indigenous peoples were exploited for their work, and [[slavery]] was not uncommon. Education was restricted for only those born in Spain and their descendants and was controlled by the Church. The main educational institutions were the Colegio de San Nicolas, founded in the 16th century; and the Seminary of San Pedro and San Pablo, founded in the 18th century. These schools produced a number of distinguished men, but the best-known is [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]].<ref name="elochis"/>
At the end of the 18th century, ideas from Europe began to infiltrate the upper classes of the state, especially in Valladolid (Morelia) and [[Zamora, Michoacán|Zamora]]. These would eventually lead to the [[Mexican War of Independence]] in the early 18th century.<ref name="historiaind">{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.mx/mich/historia/independ.html |title=El Estado de Michoacán Epoca Independiente |publisher=UMSNH |location=Morelia, Michoacán |language=es |trans-title=The state of Michoacan Independence Era |access-date=June 16, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129211803/http://www.umich.mx/mich/historia/independ.html |archive-date=November 29, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> This war was foreshadowed by the 1809 conspiracy in Valladolid.<ref name="elochis"/>

One of the early and main protagonists of the war, [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]], was educated as a priest in the state and began to disseminate Enlightenment ideas here. Soon after Hidalgo performed the [[Grito de Dolores]] in Dolores (now [[Dolores Hidalgo]]), Guanajuato, a number of people influenced by his thought took up arms against the colonial government. These included [[Manuel de la Torre Lloreda]], [[Gertrudis Bocanegra]], [[José María Garcia Obeso]] and [[Ignacio López Rayón]]. During his campaign, Hidalgo returned to Valladolid, issuing a decree eliminating slavery.<ref name="historiaind"/>

After Hidalgo's death, much of the insurgency and [[Espionage|spies]] against the Spanish viceroy were located in Michoacán, with documents such as the "Primera Constitución o Decreto Constitucional para la Libertad de la América Mexicana" (First Constitution or Constitutional Decree for the Liberty of the Mexican America) and "Sentimentos de la Nacion", both of which would shape constitutions and governments in the years to come. The first [[Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation|Mexican Supreme Court]] was also founded here. The Mexican War of Independence was culminated by the army of [[Agustín de Iturbide]], also a Michoacán native, who took Morelia in May 1821.<ref name="elochis"/>

After the war ended in 1821, the territory of Michoacán became the "Free and Sovereign State of Michoacán on January 31, 1824.<ref name="historiaind"/> This state was initially divided into 4 departments and 22 portions (partidos) under the Ley Territorial of 1825, with the first constitution ratified in the same year. The name of the capital was changed from Valladolid to Morelia at the same time.<ref name="elochis"/>

In 1831, the state was reorganized into 61 municipals and 207 locales (tenencias). Due to the struggle between centralists and federalists in Mexico in the 19th century, Michoacán's rights as an entity would change depending on who was in control. The state was declared a department in 1836 but became a more independent state again in 1846. Colima broke off from Michoacán to form its own state in this year. In 1849, the municipality of Coyuca was separated to form the state of Guerrero. In 1853, the state became a department again, regaining state status in 1856. In 1857, [[Contepec]] was separated from the state of Guanajuato and attached to Michoacán.<ref>{{cite book |date=1996 |title=Estado de Michoacán de Ocampo.

During the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French Intervention in Mexico]], Morelia was taken by French forces in 1863. Since resistance to the French was particularly strong here, punitive acts were undertaken by the French in places like [[Zitácuaro]], where much of the city was burned. One of the first victories against the French during the Intervention occurred in Zamora.<ref name="elochis"/>

In 1907, Michoacán's boundaries changed again with the addition of the communities of [[Pungarabato]] and [[Zirandaro]] added from Guerrero state to make the [[Balsas River]] a natural border.<ref name="elochis"/> The [[Mexican Revolution]] came to Michoacán in 1911, when those loyal to [[Francisco I. Madero]] proclaimed [[Santa Clara del Cobre]] as their territory, then went on to take towns around Lake Patzcuaro under the leadership of [[Salvador Escalante]]. The governor of the state, Aristeo Mendoza, resigned. Fighting among various factions would continue in parts of the state for the rest of the war. The state's current constitution was ratified in 1918.<ref name="elochis"/> In 1920, the [[Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo]] was founded.<ref name="elochis"/>

Soon after the end of the Revolution, the [[Cristero War]] would affect the state, which affected agricultural production and distribution. In 1926, hostilities closed the seminaries in Morelia and Zamora. Near the end of the war, [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] was elected governor of the state and served until 1932; he became president of Mexico in 1934.<ref name="elochis"/>

Michoacán has been badly affected by the [[Mexican Drug War]], due to its [[methamphetamine]] and [[marijuana]] production. That resulted in the start of an [[Mexican drug war|anti-drug trafficking campaign in 2006]], an anti-narcotics operation [[Operation Michoacán|since 2006]], [[grenade]] attacks [[Morelia grenade attacks|in 2008]], a [[shootout]] [[2015 Tanhuato–Ecuandureo shootout|in 2015]] as well as [[Uruapan massacre|a massacre]] and [[2019 Western Michoacán clashes|clashes in 2019]].

==Geography==
[[File:LakePatztztztz.JPG|thumb|View of Lake Patzcuaro from Tzintzuntzan]]
The state is located in the center west of the Mexican Republic, on the extreme southwest of the central highlands. It borders the states of Mexico, Querétaro, Guerrero, Guanajuato, Jalisco and Colima, with a {{cvt|217|km|adj=on}} coastline on the Pacific Ocean. The state has a territory of {{cvt|58836.95|km2}}, making it the sixteenth-largest in Mexico (exactly at the midpoint among Mexican states in area). It also has {{cvt|1490|km2}} of marine territory off its Pacific coast.<ref name="introduccion"/><ref name="mediofisico">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_michoacan |title=Medio Fisico |year=2009 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Michoacán |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=History |access-date=June 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517162648/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_Michoacan |archive-date=May 17, 2011}}</ref>

The state is crossed by the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]], the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]] and the Inter-mountain Valleys region. The Sierra Madre del Sur crosses the state northwest to southeast for approximately {{cvt|200|km}} in the southwest between the municipalities of [[Chinicuila]] and [[Arteaga, Michoacán|Arteaga]] along the Pacific Coast. It is considered to be a continuation of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]]. Peaks in this range average about {{cvt|2900|m}} above sea level, with the largest being the Cerro de las Canoas. The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt crosses the state from west to east toward the [[Toluca Valley]] and [[Valley of Mexico]]. This mountain range is marked by appearance of many volcanoes, active, dormant, and extinct alike. This system is subdivided into regions such as the Sierra de Tancítaro, Sierra de Periban, Sierra de San Angel and others. The best-known volcano in this region is the [[Paricutín]] volcano.<ref name="mediofisico"/> [[Image:Paricutin 30 613.jpg|thumb|Parícutin 1943 eruption at night]]

The state has a large number of lakes, [[waterfalls]], [[lagoons]], [[hot spring]]s, and a natural system of waterways, including parts of two of the country's largest rivers, the [[Lerma River|Lerma]] and the Balsas. These waterways are divided into three regions, called the North, Central and South.  The North region includes the Lerma Basin.  On the Lerma River is the Tepuxtepec Dam which has a capacity of 371 million m<sup>3</sup>. Rivers that empty into the Lerma in Michoacán include the Tlalpuhahua, Cachivi and Duero.  Another river basin here is that of [[Lake Cuitzeo]], which extends over an area of {{cvt|3618|m2}}. The two main rivers that feed this lake are the Grande de Morelia and Queréndaro.<ref name="mediofisico"/>
[[File:Sierra-madre-del-sur.JPG|thumb|Sierra Madre del Sur along the Michoacán seacoast]]
The Central region is represented by lakes [[Lake Pátzcuaro|Pátzcuaro]] and [[Lake Zirahuén|Zirahuén]]. Lake Pátzcuaro has a surface area of 1,525&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. This lake is fed by a number of surface and subterranean water flows with the principal rivers leading here including the San Gregorio and Chapultepec. This lake has five islands within it called [[Janitzio]], Yunuén, La Pacanda, Tecuén, Jarácuaro, Urandén and Carián. Lake Zirahuén has an area of {{cvt|615|km2}} and is fed by streams such as Manzanilla and Zinamba. These two lakes are considered to be the main tourist attraction of the state.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

Most of the state's rivers and streams are located in the south region of the state, with the Balsas River being the most important. The most important tributaries of this river include the Cutzamala, Carácuaro and Tepalcatepec rivers. Within this region is the coastal watershed, which is the area between the Sierra Madre del Sur and the coastline. This area includes small rivers such as the Coahuayana, Aquila, Ostula, Motín del Oro, Coire, Cachán and Nexpa which flow directly into the Pacific.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

Much of the climate of the state is determined by altitude and other geographical features. Average temperatures vary from {{cvt|13|°C}} to {{cvt|29|°C}}. Lower temperatures correspond with the highland areas in the north and east while the lower south and west, called La Costa (the coast) or [[Tierra Caliente (Mexico)|Tierra Caliente]] (hot land) register higher temperatures. In the hotter lowlands, high temperatures regularly exceed {{cvt|30|°C}} and have been known to reach over {{cvt|40|°C}} in the summer. The lowest temperatures are registered in highland areas such as the Sierra de Coalcomán and the Sierra del Centro located near the border with the State of Mexico. Except for the Tierra Caliente, most of the state can experience freezing temperatures in the winter. Rainfall is also dependent on altitude with the lowlands receiving less rain than the mountain areas. There is a well-defined rainy season which extends from June to October over the entire state.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

===Flora===
Ecosystems vary by altitude. Between {{cvt|2600|and|3500|m}} above sea level, most of the vegetation are conifer forests. Between {{cvt|1000|and|2600|m}}, there are mixed forests and below this are broadleaf or tropical forests. Tree species include oak, cedar, and pine. [[Mango trees]] can be found in the eastern and western regions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mexico: Michoacan exported a total of 88,700 tons of mango in 2019 |url=https://www.freshplaza.com/article/9146507/mexico-michoacan-exported-a-total-of-88-700-tons-of-mango-in-2019/ |website=freshplaza.com |access-date=April 15, 2020 |archive-date=August 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804000054/https://www.freshplaza.com/article/9146507/mexico-michoacan-exported-a-total-of-88-700-tons-of-mango-in-2019/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Protected areas===
Protected areas in Michoacán include [[Barranca del Cupatitzio National Park|Barranca del Cupatitzio]], 
[[Bosencheve National Park|Bosencheve]], [[Cerro de Garnica National Park|Cerro de Garnica]], [[Insurgente José María Morelos y Pavón National Park|Insurgente José María Morelos]], [[Lago de Camécuaro National Park|Lago de Camécuaro]], and [[Rayón National Park|Rayón]] [[national parks of Mexico|national parks]], [[Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve|Monarch Butterfly]] and [[Zicuirán-Infiernillo Biosphere Reserve|Zicuirán-Infiernillo]] [[biosphere reserves of Mexico|biosphere reserves]], and [[Pico de Tancítaro|Pico de Tancítaro Flora and Fauna Protection Area]]. [[Lake Pátzcuaro]] and [[Zacapu Lagoon]] are [[Ramsar Site]]s, designated wetlands of international importance.

==Economy==
[[File:ParachoMainstreet.jpg|thumb|Famed guitar town of [[Paracho]]]]
The economy of the state is based on agriculture, ranching, forest products, fishing and crafts.<ref name="introduccion"/> Most of the population is employed in three sectors: agriculture (34%), mining and manufacturing (23%), and commerce (37%).

=== Agriculture ===
Agriculture occupies over a million hectares of land in the state or 20% of the land area. Three-fifths of this agriculture occurs only during the rainy season. [[Irrigation]] farming is restricted to areas such as the [[Apatzingán Valley]], the [[Bajío]] area of Michoacán, the [[Zamora Valley]] and some others. Principal crops include corn, [[sorghum]], [[avocado]]s, [[strawberries]], peaches, wheat, limes, sugar cane and mangos. While corn accounts for 43% of the crops harvested, Michoacán is the largest producer of avocados in Mexico and in the world. Forty three percent of farmland in the territory is dedicated to the raising of livestock, including cattle, domestic fowl, sheep, goats and pigs. In 2007, the state's production of meat, dairy and eggs was valued at over four billion pesos.<ref name="economia">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_michoacan |title=Actividad Economica |year=2009 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Michoacán |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Economic activity |access-date=June 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517162648/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_Michoacan |archive-date=May 17, 2011}}</ref>

=== Forestry ===
Sixty percent of the state is covered in forest, with the most economically important of these located in the higher elevations at the eastern side. These forests mostly produce lumber and resin. These areas are estimated at 2,160,000 hectares, over half of which is pine forest. The most productive forests are located in the central and eastern portions of the state. Rainforest areas are estimated at 460,500 hectares. One problem facing the forested areas of the state is unsustainable logging. In addition to exploitable forest, there are also ecological reserves with tourist importance, especially the various monarch butterfly sanctuaries in the extreme east of the state.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

=== Fishing ===
[[File:Pátzcuaro-Trad-Fishing-3.jpg|thumb|Fishermen in Lake Pátzcuaro]]
Michoacán's lakes, rivers and coastline make it an important producer of fish and seafood, both caught in the wild and farmed. The most important commercial fishing is for [[tilapia]] and [[carp]].<ref name="economia"/>

=== Mining and minerals ===
Mining is an important economic activity in the state, which is mostly concentrated on the eastern side near the Mexico State border.  However, iron is mined in the Lázaro Cárdenas area near the coast. Both metallic and non-metallic minerals are mined in the state. These include silver, gold, [[zinc]], [[cadmium]], lead, iron, copper, [[fill dirt]], [[sand]], [[gravel]], [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[limestone]], [[marble]], and others. There are thirteen principal mining areas: Tlalpujahua, Angangueo, Los Azufres, Real de Otzumatlán, Tzitzio, Tiámaro, El Bastán, San Diego Curucupacéo, Inguarán, Las Truchas, and La Minita de Coalcomán. Michoacán is the second-largest producer of coke and third-largest producer of iron, which are essential to the steel industry, in Mexico. While there remains significant metallic deposits, their mining only contributes 1.64% to the economy.<ref name="mediofisico"/><ref name="economia"/>

=== Manufacturing ===
Most industrial activity is concentrated in the central region of the state, near the capital, where a number of industrial parks are located, such as Ciudad Industrial Morelia. However. there are other areas with industry, such as Apatzingán, Zamora, [[Jiquilpan, Michoacán|Jiquilpan]] and [[Sahuayo]], as well as in the [[Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán|Lázaro Cárdenas]] area. Major production areas are iron and steel (34.27%), bottling (10.43%) and paper products (8.36%).<ref name="economia"/>
Most people in the state are employed in service and commerce, and this sector contributes 19.07% to the overall economy. Most sales are in foodstuffs, drinks and tobacco.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

==Transport==
The state contains more than {{cvt|12804|km}} of federal, state and local roads. Major highways in the state include Federal Highway 15 and the Morelia-Patzcuaro highway.  Intercity and interstate buses provide connections to places within the state and the rest of Mexico. About 91% of these bus lines are second class while just under nine percent are first class. Most rail lines are limited to the north and center of the state, providing freight service to Mexico City and Guadalajara. The state's main port is the city of Lázaro Cárdenas which contains {{cvt|2926|m}} of dock space. The dock is used mostly for the shipping of minerals and grains.<ref name="educacion">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_michoacan |title=Infraestructura Social y de Comunicaciones |year=2009 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Michoacán |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Social infrastructure and communications |access-date=June 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517162648/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_Michoacan |archive-date=May 17, 2011}}</ref><ref name="comunicaciones">{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.mx/mich/historia/independ.html |title=El Estado de Michoacán Comunicaciones |publisher=UMSNH |location=Morelia, Michoacán |language=es |trans-title=The State of Michoacan Communications |access-date=June 16, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129211803/http://www.umich.mx/mich/historia/independ.html |archive-date=November 29, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> There are two major international airports, [[Morelia International Airport]] and [[Uruapan International Airport]].

However, only 6.2% of these sites are visited by international tourists. Most visitors to sites are from within the state.<ref name="economia"/>

The Morelia region stresses its cultural and artistic heritage, especially its colonial architecture . The most important colonial structures are in Morelia and built in the 18th century. These include the cathedral, finished in 1744 and the main aqueduct finished at the end of the century. This architecture has made the city a World Heritage Site. In addition to the state capital, the region includes towns such as Charo, Capula, Tiripetio, [[Cuitzeo]] and [[Huandacareo]], which contain archaeological sites, water parks and traditional cuisine. The rural areas of this zone contain more than 400 thermal springs, many of which have been turned into recreational areas and parks.  These include Reino de Atzimba, Cointzio, Huandacareo and El Ejido.<ref name="regionmor">{{cite web |url=http://www.michoacan.gob.mx/Regiones/Region_Morelia |title=Region Morelis |publisher=State of Michoacán |location=Michoacán |language=es |trans-title=Morelia Region |access-date=June 16, 2010 |archive-date=July 27, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727000841/http://www.michoacan.gob.mx/Regiones/Region_Morelia |url-status=live }}</ref> Morelia holds the annual ''Festival Internacional de Música de Morelia''.

The Uruapan region stresses its cultural and natural heritage. The city is one of the oldest settlements in the state, which was initially settled by the [[Meseta Purépecha]]. This city contains a number of attractions such as La Huatápera, colonial era hospital founded by Vasco de Quiroga, the Temple of San Francisco and the Eduardo Ruiz Municipal Museum. One other attraction is the narrowest house in the world as documented by the [[Guinness Book of World Records]]. Other important cities in the region are Apatzingán and Caracha.<ref name="regionuru">{{cite web |url=http://www.michoacan.gob.mx/Regiones/Region_Uruapan |title=Region Uruapan |publisher=State of Michoacán |location=Michoacán |language=es |trans-title=Uruapan Region |access-date=June 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505175519/http://www.michoacan.gob.mx/Regiones/Region_Uruapan |archive-date=May 5, 2012}}</ref>
Uruapan is surrounded by hundreds of hectares of forests and by fertile fields growing fruits and flowers, many of which only grow here. Some of the natural attractions of the zone include the Santa Catarina Dam and the La Tzaráacua and La Tzararacuita waterfalls. Smaller towns and villages in this region are known for their religious and popular festivals, many of which occur in the summer. Examples of these are the feasts of Señor del Calvario in Quinceo, of San Mateo Ahuiran in Paracho and the National Guitar Festival in Paracho. The best-known town in the region is [[Nuevo San Juan Parangaricutiro|San Juan Nuevo Parangaricutiro]], which was founded due to the destruction of its original namesake by the eruption of the [[Paricutín]] volcano.<ref name="regionuru"/> The pre-Hispanic sites of [[Tingambato]] and [[Taretan]] are in this zone as well, which were important Purépecha cities.<ref name="regionuru"/>

The town of Paracho is well known throughout both Mexico and elsewhere in the world as a hub of [[lutherie]]. This is because the town's craftsmen are reputed to making the best sounding [[guitar]]s and [[vihuela]]s in all of Mexico. The town is full of music shops that sell ten-string [[mandolin]]s, [[armadillo]]-backed guitars ([[concheras]]), acoustic bass guitars; as well as regular classical guitars and mandolins, [[bajo sexto]]s, vihuelas, [[guitarron]]es and many others. Many of the stores and workshops allow visitors to watch the guitar-making process directly.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.nl/paracho-mexico-guitar-making-town-coco-2020-9/ |website=Business Insider |access-date=September 27, 2020 |date=September 3, 2020 |title=The guitar-making hub of the world is a small Mexican town where handmade instruments can cost more than $5,500 |archive-date=April 26, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210426223241/https://www.businessinsider.nl/paracho-mexico-guitar-making-town-coco-2020-9/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Lázaro Cárdenas region is named after Michoacán's largest port and oceanside city. Here the state stresses the kilometres of beaches and other natural areas in which to practice ecotourism and extreme sports. Beaches include Maruata, Faro de Bucerías, the Pichi Estuary, La Laguna de Mezcala, La Ticla and Nexpa, with the last two popular for [[surfing]], with their regular two-three-meter waves. A number of these beaches are protected areas, due to being a breeding ground for sea turtles.<ref name="regionlc">{{cite web |url=http://www.michoacan.gob.mx/Regiones/Region_Lazaro_Cardenas |title=Region Lázaro Cárdenas |publisher=State of Michoacán |location=Michoacán |language=es |trans-title=Lázaro Cárdenas Region |access-date=June 16, 2010 |archive-date=January 11, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111074650/http://www.michoacan.gob.mx/Regiones/Region_Lazaro_Cardenas |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Patzcuaro region is extremely important to the state due to its history of having been the center of the [[Purépecha Empire]] as well as the first capital of the colonial province of Michoacán. Its pre-Hispanic heritage is evident by the Tzintzuntzan and Ihuatizo sites as well as the large number of people who still speak the [[Purépecha language]] and maintain pre-Hispanic customs. Vasco de Quiroga established the first capital at Patzcuaro and was instrumental to building the colonial era economy of the Lake Patzcuaro area. The lake is surrounded by mountains and forests as well as the towns of [[Cuanajo]], [[Tupátaro]], [[Eronguícuaro]] and [[Quiroga, Michoacán|Quiroga]]. These towns are noted for their crafts and popular religious festivals such as the feast of the Señor del Rescate in [[Tzintzuntzan, Michoacán|Tzintzuntzan]], [[Holy Week]], and especially Noche de Muertos or Night of the Dead. This area is the most important to the state with the most visited town, Patzcuaro with its basilica and museums.<ref name="regionpatz">{{cite web |url=http://www.michoacan.gob.mx/Regiones/Region_Patzcuaro |title=Region Pátzcuaro |publisher=State of Michoacán |location=Michoacán |language=es |trans-title=Patzcuaro Region |access-date=June 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727000846/http://www.michoacan.gob.mx/Regiones/Region_Patzcuaro |archive-date=July 27, 2010}}</ref>

One of the largest tourist events in the state is Noche de Muertos or Night of the Dead. This is celebrated on the dates around November 2. Essentially, these are [[Day of the Dead]] celebrations, which are celebrated all over Mexico, but with unique variations. The events of these days show a blending of both pre-Hispanic and Catholic beliefs and traditions. Noche de Muertos is celebrated most strongly in the towns and villages around Lake Patzcuaro such as Tzintzuntzan, Ihuatzio, Janitzio, as well as Patzcuaro itself, which was the center of the Purépecha Empire. As in other parts of Mexico, altars to the dead, both in homes and on graves are erected and covered with offerings such as bread, fruit and other items. One aspect which is unique to the event here is the lighting and floating of hundreds of small candles and flowers on Lake Patzcuaro on the night between November 1 and 2. It is also believed that on this night the [[ghosts]] of Mintzita, the daughter of Purépecha king Tzintzicha, and Itzihuapa arise. Their story is similar to that of Romeo and Juliet as they were never able to marry due to the Spanish invasion of their lands. Today, it is said that the two rise up and head toward a specific cemetery to receive visitors. There are a number of other rituals performed on these days such as the Terescuan y Campaneri, a kind of treasure hunt for hidden harvest items.<ref name="muertos">{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.mx/mich/cultura/noche-muertos/ |title=Noche de Muertes in Michoacán |publisher=UMSNH |location=Morelia, Michoacán |language=es |trans-title=Night of the Dead in Michoacan |access-date=June 16, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323032040/http://www.umich.mx/mich/cultura/noche-muertos/ |archive-date=March 23, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Zamora region is center of the city of the same name in an area known as the [[Purépecha Mesa]]. Pre-Hispanic language and customs are preserved here as well as a large number of crafts such as the pottery of Ptamban and the embroidery of Tarecuato. The region is part of an area of Mexico known as the Bajío and has extensive agriculture, livestock and some industry. Regional dishes such as pigs' feet, breads baked in wood fired ovens, [[tamale]]s, [[pozole]] and dishes made with avocados and corn are promoted here. Important towns outside of Zamora include Camécuaro, Orandiro, La Estancia and La Alberca. The city of Zamora is home to one of the oldest cultures in the west of Mexico which dates to about 1750 BCE, known as the Opeño.  The Spanish city was founded as a military garrison.<ref name="regionzam">{{cite web |url=http://www.michoacan.gob.mx/Regiones/Region_Zamora |title=Region Zamora |publisher=State of Michoacán |location=Michoacán |language=es |trans-title=Zamora Region |access-date=June 16, 2010 |archive-date=July 27, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727000916/http://www.michoacan.gob.mx/Regiones/Region_Zamora |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Zitacuaro region contains approximately a half million hectares of conifer forests, but is best known as being part of the wintering grounds of the [[monarch butterfly]]. The area is filled with old mining towns as well as an important archaeological site. The region is home to the [[Mazahua people|Mazahua]] and Otomi peoples, many of whom produce crafts such as blankets, [[rebozo]]s and ceramics. The city of Zitacuaro is the site of an important battle during the French Intervention in Mexico, which gives it the title of "Heroic City". Other important communities include Añgangueo, San Matias and [[Ciudad Hidalgo, Michoacán|Ciudad Hidalgo]]. The most important places to see monarch butterflies in the winter are in municipalities of Angangeo and Ocampo. The butterfly sanctuaries are called El Rosario, Cerro Campanario, Sierra Chincua and El Llanno de las Papas.<ref name="regionzit">{{cite web |url=http://www.michoacan.gob.mx/Regiones/Region_Zitacuaro |title=Region Zitácuaro |publisher=State of Michoacán |location=Michoacán |language=es |trans-title=Zitacuaro Region |access-date=June 16, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727000939/http://www.michoacan.gob.mx/Regiones/Region_Zitacuaro |archive-date=July 27, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2008, UNESCO declared this region part of a [[Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve]].<ref name="Centre"/>

==Crime==
After the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) fell from power in 2000, the surge in criminal violence was unexpected. From homicides and kidnappings to organized crime, the violence that began to emerge while in a position of political change had posed a significant threat to the nation’s stability.<ref name="Aranda 2013 43–66">{{Cite journal |last=Aranda |first=Salvador Maldonado |date=2013 |title=Stories of Drug Trafficking in Rural Mexico: Territories, Drugs and Cartels in Michoacán |journal=Revista Europea de Estudios Latinoamericanos y del Caribe / European Review of Latin American and Caribbean Studies |issue=94 |pages=43–66 |doi=10.18352/erlacs.8393 |jstor=23408421 |issn=0924-0608|doi-access=free }}</ref> Even though criminal groups and the state are on two ends of the spectrum, they are seen working together.

In Michoacán, the criminal groups are more equipped with weapons than the state institutions themselves, which means they simply overpower the government. With the heavy influence of criminal violence, even avocado producers had to step in and combat this violence. Michoacán is the second largest avocado producer in the entire world, and with that territory comes criminal groups demanding money from the avocado producers.

===Drug Cartels===
[[File:Tierra caliente map.png|thumb|The region the [[Tierra Caliente (Mexico)|Tierra Caliente]] covers.]]

The cartels are able to pay state officials to do their dirty work for them in exchange for keeping their criminal group up and successful.<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal |last=Bonner |first=Robert C. |date=2010 |title=The New Cocaine Cowboys: How to Defeat Mexico's Drug Cartels |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25680978 |journal=Foreign Affairs |volume=89 |issue=4 |pages=35–47 |jstor=25680978 |issn=0015-7120}}</ref> Adding on to the fluidity of criminal groups and government officials working together, the hope for Mexico to strengthen its powers back into a non-corrupt state is not high.<ref name=":02" /> [[La Familia Michoacana]], [[Jalisco New Generation Cartel]],<ref name="cjng-cu">{{Cite web |date=2020-12-04 |title=Violence escalates in Michoacán: clash between cartels leaves 6 dead |url=https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/escalating-violence-in-michoacan/ |access-date=2021-04-24 |website=Mexico News Daily |language=en-US |archive-date=April 24, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210424185233/https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/escalating-violence-in-michoacan/ |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Los Zetas]],<ref name="intelysegeneral" /> [[Beltrán-Leyva Organization]],<ref name="intelysegeneral" /> the [[Knights Templar Cartel]]<ref name="intelysegeneral" /> and [[La Resistencia (gang)|Cárteles Unidos]]<ref name="cjng-cu" /> are some groups that operate in Michoacán. These groups are a threat to the government's security because Michoacán is now the center for drug production in the world. The reason drug cartels seem to thrive in Michoacán is due to what is called the ''[[Tierra Caliente (Mexico)|Tierra Caliente]]'' in the southern part of the State. This region is far from the bustling atmosphere and with roads that are pretty inaccessible, it makes for an ideal place to do criminal activities.<ref name="Aranda 2013 43–66"/>

Michoacán is the seventh most populated state in Mexico and the average resident has a life expectancy of 73.3 years. It is estimated that each year about 40,000 people immigrate to the state while 78,000 leave, leading to population loss. Of those who leave, about one third go to other places in Mexico and the rest to other countries, principally the United States. The cities with the densest populations are Morelia, Uruapan and Zamora.<ref name="demogr">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_michoacan |title=Perfil Sociodemografico |year=2009 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Michoacán |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Social demographic profile |access-date=June 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517162648/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_Michoacan |archive-date=May 17, 2011}}</ref> The majority of the population are [[mestizos]]; meaning that they are part indigenous, part European (mainly from Spain), and some African.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12394-010-0074-7 |title="The Map of the Mexican's Genome": Overlapping national identity, and population genomics |year=2010 |last1=Schwartz-Marín |first1=Ernesto |last2=Silva-Zolezzi |first2=Irma |journal=Identity in the Information Society |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=489–514 |s2cid=144786737 |doi-access=free|hdl=10871/33766 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> Michoacán is one of the most Catholic regions in Mexico.

[[Charreada]] is an important sport in the state. It celebrates the mestizo culture and heritage of Michoacán; in which the Spaniards employed the indigenous people as [[vaqueros]] or ranchers to herd cattle. During the [[Mexican Revolution]], both sides used [[charros]] as soldiers. They were also used to maintain order against bandits. The typical Michoacán [[charro outfit]] consists of tight, embroidered pants and jacket, dress shirt, chaps, a cloak-like [[sarape]], and a [[sombrero]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Charreada Archivos |url=https://www.lavozdemichoacan.com.mx/tag/charreada/ |website=La Voz de Michoacán |access-date=April 16, 2020 |language=es |archive-date=August 3, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803222706/https://www.lavozdemichoacan.com.mx/tag/charreada/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Michoacán has a history of European immigrants including: Italians, [[Spaniards]], and the French. There are small Italian communities found throughout the state including the cities of [[Nueva Italia, Michoacán]] and [[Lombardia]] in Michoacán, both founded by Dante Cusi from Gambar in [[Brescia]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alvarado-Sizzo |first1=Ilia |last2=Urquijo Torres |first2=Pedro |title=La 'Espantosa Odisea' italiana en la Hacienda Lombardía.

During the [[Spanish Civil War]], 456 children from Spain arrived in Morelia as refugees. Most of them stayed even after the war concluded.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Valera |first1=Payá |title=Los niños españoles de Morelia : el exilio infantil en México |date=October 1, 2002 |publisher=Editorial Milenio |isbn=8497430409 |pages=133–137 |edition=4. |url=https://www.dimensionantropologica.inah.gob.mx/?p=913 |access-date=April 15, 2020 |archive-date=August 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801140939/https://www.dimensionantropologica.inah.gob.mx/?p=913 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The indigenous population is estimated at just over seven percent of the total, with most living in 29 municipalities.  Many are [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]], which are located in the Meseta-Cañada, Patzcuaro Lake, Zirahuén Lake, and Zacapu regions. In the east of the state, in the municipalities of Ocampo, Anguangueo, Tuxpan, Hidalgo, Maravatío and Zitácuaro, there is a mix of Mazahua, Otomi and Purépecha. On the coast can be found the Aquila, Chinicuila and Coahuayana peoples.<ref name="demogr"/> The Purépecha are seen as Michoacán's most devoted [[Catholics]]; as well as mixing traditional indigenous elements such as Noche de Muertos.

According to the 2020 Census, 1.55% of Michoacán's population identified as Black, [[Afro-Mexican]], or of African descent.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/ccpv/2020/tableros/panorama/ |title=Panorama sociodemográfico de México |website=www.inegi.org.mx |access-date=October 10, 2021 |archive-date=January 26, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210126013823/https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/ccpv/2020/tableros/panorama/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
