The city had a population of 422,600 at the 2019 [[Census]],<ref>State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan: Census of 1 October 2019.https://www.stat.gov.az/source/demoqraphy/</ref> (excluding the population in the occupied territories at the time of Census) making it the [[List of cities in Azerbaijan|second largest city]] in Azerbaijan after Baku.

The city has a territory of {{convert|83|km2|0}}. It was founded as a suburb of Baku in 1944 and received city status on 22 November 1949, growing into a major industrial center during the Soviet period.<ref name="exe">{{cite web |url=http://sumqayit-ih.gov.az/content.php?page=passport |title=Sumqayıt şəhər icra hakimiyyəti.

It is home to [[Sumqayit State University]].

== Etymology ==
The name of city comes from the name of the [[Mongol Empire|Mongolian tribe]] Sugaut (Sagait).<ref>Mustafayev, Shahin (2018) [https://jhss-khazar.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Outlines-of-the-Mongolian-supremacy-in-Azerbaijan-and-the-South-Caucasus.pdf ''Outlines of the Mongolian supremacy in Azerbaijan and the South Caucasus''] Khazar Press</ref>

According to local [[Azerbaijani folklore|folklore]] the city is named after the [[:az:Sumqayıtçay|Sumgait River]]. One folk legend tells the tale of a hero by the name of "Sum", who is chosen by the community to fight a monster that was blocking the Sumgait River.<ref>{{cite web|title=Əfsanələr|url=http://www.sumhistorymuseum.az/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=60&Itemid=75|website=www.sumhistorymuseum.az|access-date=18 November 2014|language=az|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113114811/http://www.sumhistorymuseum.az/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=60&Itemid=75|archive-date=13 November 2014}}</ref> Sum eventually manages to kill the monster, but when the river is released he is swept away by the waters and never seen again. After that, his beloved, Jeyran, inconsolable due to Sum's disappearance, would go to the river and cry "Sum qayıt!" (which means "Sum, come back!" in [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Tarixi Əfsanə|url=http://www.sumqayit-ih.gov.az/page/11.html|website=www.sumqayit-ih.gov.az|access-date=18 November 2014|language=az|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112223558/http://www.sumqayit-ih.gov.az/page/11.html|archive-date=12 November 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> So the river became known as Sumgait, after which the city was named.

== History ==
=== Medieval era ===
According to historians, [[Medes|Medean tribes]] lived in the area in ancient times. During the construction boom, when the foundation of the executive power building was being excavated, remains of an ancient [[caravanserai]] along with personal items and kitchenware was found at the site.{{cn|date=August 2024}}

The first reports of settlements at the present site of Sumgait were in 1580, when English traveller H. Barrow mentioned Sumgait in his writings and in 1858, when [[Alexander Dumas]] wrote about the area in his memoirs ''Trip to Caucasus'', although nothing substantial was created on the site until the [[Soviet Union]] gained control over the area in the 1920s.<ref name=exe-2>{{cite web |url=http://sumqayit-ih.gov.az/content.php?page=passport |title=Sumqayıt şəhər icra hakimiyyəti.

=== Environment ===
As a result of the Soviet planning of the industrial boom era, the city became heavily polluted.{{cn|date=August 2024}} Soon after Azerbaijan's independence, the industrial sectors went into decline. The Absheron Peninsula (which consists of Sumgait, [[Baku]] and the [[Absheron District]]) was considered by scientists to be the most ecologically devastated part of Azerbaijan.  The city was known for its children's cemetery, known as the "Baby Cemetery" which contains many graves of infants born with deformities and mental retardation that were further complicated by the lack of adequate medical care for the poor.<ref>[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/23_folder/23_articles/23_sumgayit.html Sumgayit: Soviet's Pride, Azerbaijan's Hell] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508014733/http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/23_folder/23_articles/23_sumgayit.html |date=2006-05-08 }} by Arif Islamzade at ''Azer.com'', Autumn 1994</ref> Sumgait was named as most polluted place on Earth by the U.S.-based environmental group the [[Blacksmith Institute]] in 2006 and placed on their list of ''The World's Most Polluted Places'' by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in 2007.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1661031_1661028_1661024,00.html Sumgayit, Azerbaijan – The World's Most Polluted Places] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031012618/http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1661031_1661028_1661024,00.html |date=2007-10-31 }} ''TIME'', September 12, 2007</ref> The report noted the former Soviet industrial base was polluting the local environment with industrial chemicals like chlorine and [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]].

The city administration prepared an environmental protection plan for 2003–2010 which has been steadily decreasing the levels of pollution to minimal. The program oversees 118 activities aimed at minimizing pollution at all possible levels of economic production. The program was prepared with the participation of all industrial enterprises in the city and its enforcement is being regulated by the executive power of the city. For instance, the amount of wastewater from industrial production went down from {{convert|600000|m3|cuft|abbr=on}} during the 1990s to {{convert|76300|m3|cuft|abbr=on}} in 2005. Solid waste went down from 300,000 to 3,868 tons a year. The [[World Bank]] has issued a loan to the Azerbaijani government for construction of a burial range for [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] waste.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sumqayit-ih.gov.az/content.php?page=tebii_servetler |title=Sumqayıt şəhər icra hakimiyyəti.

}}
In 1935, the Soviet government decided to develop heavy industry in the [[Absheron Peninsula]], and the future location of Sumgait was chosen based on its proximity to [[Baku]] and its key position on the existing railroad lines.

Between 1938 and 1941, a [[thermal power station]] was constructed to power Baku's growing [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan|petroleum industry]].  This was soon followed by more heavy industries. Due to [[World War II]] the construction of the area stopped and resumed in 1944 when [[metallurgical]] and [[chemical industry|chemical plants]] were constructed and put into operation. The first production of ''Sumgait Chemical Plant'' led to a rapid growth and construction boom, creating a new job market, and a need for a resident population. In 1949, Sumgait gained official city status according to the resolution of the [[Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan SSR]]. In 1952, a tube-rolling plant delivered its first produce thus developing black metallurgy production in Azerbaijan. The same year, another new [[Synthetic rubber|Synthetic Rubber]] Production Plant started its operations producing [[ethylene]] obtained from [[petroleum|oil]]. Operations at ''Sumgait Steel Processing Plant'' and ''Sumgait Aluminium Plant'' were commenced in 1953 and 1955, respectively. In 1957–1955, a number of scientific research facilities and cultural centres were built, leading to further development of the city infrastructure. In 1960, authorities started building the Petroleum Chemical Factory, the largest in [[Europe]] at the time. From 1961 through 1968, a [[brick]]-producing factory, a [[polymer|polymer construction materials]] industrial complex, a [[Phosphor#Materials|phosphor]] production plant were built. In the 1970–80s, [[light industry]] and mechanical engineering facilities were added to the industrial base of the city. By the end of the 1980s, Sumgait was already the centre of the chemical industry of the USSR.<ref name=exe-2/>

The ''Culture and Leisure Park'' was laid on {{convert|23|ha|acre|abbr=off}} of Sumgait coastline in 1967. On August 17, 1978, the park was given the name of a distinguished [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] poet [[Imadaddin Nasimi]].

The flora of the park includes 39 types of trees. Events of the 1990s, such as the [[Black January]] tragedy and [[First Nagorno-Karabakh War]], led to the establishment of ''Stars'' (Ulduzlar) and ''20 January Monument'' monuments in the park. In the eastern section of the park, Shehidler Khiyabani, similar to [[Martyrs' Lane]] in Baku, was established as a burial ground for thousands of soldiers from Sumgait who died during the war. According to Decree No. 132 of the [[Cabinet of Azerbaijan|Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan]] dated August 2, 2001, the park was given the status of national historical importance.
