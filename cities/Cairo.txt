==Etymology==
The name of Cairo is derived from the Arabic ''{{Transliteration|ar|ALA|al-Qāhirah}}'' ({{lang|ar|القاهرة}}), meaning 'the Vanquisher' or 'the Conqueror', given by the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] Caliph [[al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah|al-Mu'izz]] following the establishment of the city as the capital of the Fatimid dynasty. Its full, formal name was ''{{Transliteration|ar|ALA|al-Qāhirah al-Mu'izziyyah}}'' (القاهرة المعزيّة), meaning 'the Vanquisher of al-Mu'izz'.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Jiwa |first=Shainool |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=89SLDwAAQBAJ&dq=cairo+al-mu%27izziya+al-qahira&pg=PT108 |title=The Fatimids: 1 - The Rise of a Muslim Empire |publisher=I.B. Tauris (in association with the Institute of Ismaili Studies) |year=2017 |isbn=978-1-78672-174-7 |language=en}}</ref> It is also supposedly due to the fact that the planet [[Mars]], known in Arabic by names such as {{lang|ar-Latn|an-Najm al-Qāhir}} ({{lang|ar|النجم القاهر}}, 'the Conquering Star'), was rising at the time of the city's founding.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVQBAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA78 |title=Towards a Shi'i Mediterranean Empire: Fatimid Egypt and the Founding of Cairo |year=2009 |publisher=I.

Egyptians often refer to Cairo as ''{{transliteration|arz|Maṣr}}'' ({{IPA|arz|mɑsˤɾ|IPA}}; {{lang|arz|مَصر}}), the [[Egyptian Arabic]] name for Egypt itself, emphasizing the city's importance for the country.{{sfn|Behrens-Abouseif|1992|p=8}}{{sfn|Golia|2004|p=152}}

There are a number of [[Coptic language|Coptic]] names for the city. ''Tikešrōmi'' ({{Langx|cop|Ϯⲕⲉϣⲣⲱⲙⲓ}} <small>Late Coptic:</small> {{IPA-all|di.kɑʃˈɾoːmi|}}) is attested in the 1211 text ''The Martyrdom of John of Phanijoit'' and is either a calque meaning 'man breaker' ({{lang|cop|Ϯ-}}, 'the', {{lang|cop|ⲕⲁϣ-}}, 'to break', and {{lang|cop|ⲣⲱⲙⲓ}}, 'man'), akin to Arabic ''{{Transliteration|ar|ALA|al-Qāhirah}}'', or a derivation from [[Arabic]] {{Lang|ar|قَصْر الرُوم}} (''qaṣr ar-rūm'', "the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] castle"), another name of [[Babylon Fortress]] in [[Old Cairo]].<ref name="Casanova-1901" /> The Arabic name is also calqued as {{coptic|ⲧⲡⲟⲗⲓⲥ ϯⲣⲉϥϭⲣⲟ}}, "the victor city" in the Coptic antiphonary.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Crum |first=W.E. |title=Catalogue of the Coptic manuscripts in the collection of the John Rylands library, Manchester |year=1909 |location=Manchester |pages=211}}</ref>

Some argue that it was  the name of an Egyptian settlement upon which Cairo was built, but it is rather doubtful as this name is not attested in any [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Hieroglyphic]] or [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] source, although some researchers, like Paul Casanova, view it as a legitimate theory.<ref name="Casanova-1901" /> Cairo is also referred to as {{lang|cop|Ⲭⲏⲙⲓ}} (<small>Late Coptic:</small> {{IPA-all|ˈkɪ.mi|}}) or {{lang|cop|Ⲅⲩⲡⲧⲟⲥ}} (<small>Late Coptic:</small> {{IPA-all|ˈɡɪp.dos|}}), which means Egypt in Coptic, the same way it is referred to in Egyptian Arabic.<ref name="Amelineau" />

The [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Muslim conquest of Byzantine Egypt]] was led by [[Amr ibn al-As]] from 639 to 642. Babylon Fortress was besieged in September 640 and fell in April 641. In 641 or early 642, after the surrender of [[Alexandria]] (the Egyptian capital at the time), he founded a new settlement next to Babylon Fortress.{{Sfn|Raymond|1993|p=16-18}}{{Sfn|Kennedy|2007|p=161}} The city, known as [[Fustat]] ({{Langx|ar|الفسطاط|translit=al-Fusṭāṭ|lit=the tent}}), served as a garrison town and as the new administrative capital of Egypt.

One of the first projects of the new Muslim administration was to clear and re-open Trajan's ancient [[Canal of the Pharaohs|canal]] in order to ship grain more directly from Egypt to [[Medina]], the capital of the [[Rashidun Caliphate|caliphate]] in [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]].{{Sfn|Raymond|1993|p=19}}{{Sfn|Kennedy|2007|p=160}}{{Sfn|AlSayyad|2011|p=42}}{{sfn|Gabra|van Loon|Reif|Swelim|2013|p=21}} Ibn al-As also founded a mosque for the city at the same time, now known as the [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As|Mosque of Amr Ibn al-As]], the oldest mosque in Egypt and Africa (although the current structure dates from later expansions).<ref name="Bloom-2009"/>{{sfn|Gabra|van Loon|Reif|Swelim|2013|p=280}}<ref>{{Cite book|last=Campanini |first=Massimo|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003 |isbn=9780195125580|editor-last=Esposito|editor-first=John L.|chapter=Cairo}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=O'Kane|first=Bernard|title=The Mosques of Egypt|publisher=American University of Cairo Press |year=2016|isbn=9789774167324|page=2}}</ref>

In 750, following the overthrow of the [[Umayyad caliphate]] by the [[Abbasids]], the new rulers created their own settlement to the northeast of Fustat which became the new provincial capital. This was known as [[al-Askar]] ({{Langx|ar|العسكر|lit=the camp}}) as it was laid out like a military camp. A governor's residence and a new mosque were also added, with the latter completed in 786.{{Sfn|Raymond|1993|p=30-31}} The Red Sea canal re-excavated in the 7th century was closed by the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur in [[al-Mansur]] ({{Reign|754|775}}),{{Sfn|Raymond|2000|p=16}} but a part of the canal, known as the [[Khalij (Cairo)|Khalij]], continued to be a major feature of Cairo's geography and of its water supply until the 19th century.{{Sfn|Abu-Lughod|1971|p=134}}<ref name="Bloom-2009" /> In 861, on the orders of the Abbasid caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]], a [[Nilometer]] was built on [[Roda Island]] near Fustat.

He was accompanied by his stepson, [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]], who became effective governor of Egypt.

===Foundation and expansion of Cairo===

In 969, the [[Isma'ilism|Shi'a Isma'ili]] Fatimid empire [[Fatimid conquest of Egypt|conquered Egypt]] after ruling from Ifriqiya. The Fatimid general [[Jawhar (general)|Jawhar Al Saqili]] founded a new fortified city northeast of [[Fustat]] and of former al-Qata'i. It took four years to build the city, initially known as al-Manṣūriyyah,{{sfn|Glassé|Smith|2003|p=96}} which was to serve as the new capital of the caliphate.<ref name="AlSayyad2013">{{cite book |last1=AlSayyad |first1=Nezar |title=Cairo: Histories of a City |year=2013 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-07245-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUkvEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA58}}</ref> During that time, the construction of the [[al-Azhar Mosque]] was commissioned by order of the caliph, which developed into the third-oldest university in the world. Cairo would eventually become a centre of learning, with the library of Cairo containing hundreds of thousands of books.{{sfn|Meri|Bacharach|2006|p=451}} When Caliph [[Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah|al-Mu'izz li Din Allah]] arrived from the old Fatimid capital of [[Mahdia]] in [[Tunisia]] in 973, he gave the city its present name, ''Qāhirat al-Mu'izz'' ("The Vanquisher of al-Mu'izz"),{{sfn|Glassé|Smith|2003|p=96}} from which the name "Cairo" (''al-Qāhira'') originates. The caliphs lived in a vast and lavish [[Fatimid Great Palaces|palace complex]] that occupied the heart of the city. Cairo remained a relatively exclusive royal city for most of this era, but during the tenure of [[Badr al-Jamali|Badr al-Gamali]] as [[vizier]] (1073–1094) the restrictions were loosened for the first time and richer families from Fustat were allowed to move into the city.{{Sfn|Raymond|1993|p=78}} Between 1087 and 1092 Badr al-Gamali also rebuilt the city walls in stone and constructed the city gates of [[Bab al-Futuh]], [[Bab al-Nasr (Cairo)|Bab al-Nasr]], and [[Bab Zuweila]] that still stand today.{{Sfn|Raymond|1993|p=62-63}}

During the Fatimid period Fustat reached its apogee in size and prosperity, acting as a center of craftsmanship and international trade and as the area's main port on the Nile.{{Sfn|Raymond|1993|p=66-69}} Historical sources report that multi-story communal residences existed in the city, particularly in its center, which were typically inhabited by middle and lower-class residents. Some of these were as high as seven stories and could house some 200 to 350 people.{{Sfn|Raymond|2000|p=65}} They may have been similar to Roman ''[[Insula (Roman city)|insulae]]'' and may have been the prototypes for the rental apartment complexes which became common in the later Mamluk and [[Egypt Eyalet|Ottoman]] periods.{{Sfn|Raymond|2000|p=65}}

However, in 1168 the Fatimid vizier [[Shawar]] set fire to unfortified Fustat to prevent its potential capture by [[Amalric of Jerusalem|Amalric]], the [[Crusades|Crusader]] king of [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]. While the fire did not destroy the city and it continued to exist afterward, it did mark the beginning of its decline. Over the following centuries it was Cairo, the former palace-city, that became the new economic center and attracted migration from Fustat.{{sfn|Daly|Petry|1998|p=213}}{{Sfn|Raymond|1993|pp=83-85, 103}}

While the Crusaders did not capture the city in 1168, a continuing power struggle between Shawar, King Amalric, and the [[Zengid]] general [[Shirkuh]] led to the downfall of the Fatimid establishment.{{sfn|Daly|Petry|1998|pp=213–215}} In 1169, Shirkuh's nephew [[Saladin]] was appointed as the new vizier of Egypt by the Fatimids and two years later he seized power from the family of the last Fatimid caliph, [[al-Adid|al-'Āḍid]].{{sfn|Daly|Petry|1998|p=215}} As the first [[Sultan of Egypt]], Saladin established the [[Ayyubid dynasty]], based in Cairo, and aligned Egypt with the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Abbasids, who were based in [[Baghdad]].{{sfn|Shillington|2005|p=438}} In 1176, Saladin began construction on the [[Cairo Citadel]], which was to serve as the seat of the Egyptian government until the mid-19th century. The construction of the Citadel definitively ended Fatimid-built Cairo's status as an exclusive palace-city and opened it up to common Egyptians and to foreign merchants, spurring its commercial development.<ref name="Denoix-1999">{{Cite book|title=Le Khan al-Khalili et ses environs: Un centre commercial et artisanal au Caire du XIIIe au XXe siècle|publisher=Institut français d'archéologie orientale|year=1999|editor-last=Denoix|editor-first=Sylvie|location=Cairo|editor-last2=Depaule|editor-first2=Jean-Charles|editor-last3=Tuchscherer|editor-first3=Michel}}</ref> Along with the Citadel, Saladin also began the construction of a new 20-kilometre-long wall that would protect both Cairo and Fustat on their eastern side and connect them with the new Citadel.

In 1250, during the [[Seventh Crusade]], the Ayyubid dynasty had a crisis with the death of [[As-Salih Ayyub|al-Salih]] and power transitioned instead to the [[Mamluk]]s, partly with the help of al-Salih's wife, [[Shajar al-Durr|Shajar ad-Durr]], who ruled for a brief period around this time.{{Sfn|Raymond|1993|p=110}}<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ruggles|first=D.F.|title=Tree of pearls: The extraordinary architectural patronage of the 13th-century Egyptian slave-queen Shajar al-Durr|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2020|pages=}}</ref> Mamluks were soldiers who were purchased as young slaves and raised to serve in the sultan's army. Between 1250 and 1517 the throne of the [[Mamluk Sultanate]] passed from one mamluk to another in a system of succession that was generally non-hereditary, but also frequently violent and chaotic.{{Sfn|Raymond|1993|pp=115-117}}{{Sfn|Clot|1996|p=47-48}} The Mamluk Empire nonetheless became a major power in the region and was responsible for repelling the advance of the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] (most famously at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] in 1260) and for eliminating the last [[Crusader states]] in the Levant.{{Sfn|Clot|1996|p=34-37, 83-107, 112-118}}

Despite their military character, the Mamluks were also prolific builders and left a rich [[Mamluk architecture|architectural legacy]] throughout Cairo.<ref name="Behrens-2007" /> Continuing a practice started by the Ayyubids, much of the land occupied by former Fatimid palaces was sold and replaced by newer buildings, becoming a prestigious site for the construction of Mamluk religious and funerary complexes.{{sfn|Raymond|2000|p=122}} Construction projects initiated by the Mamluks pushed the city outward while also bringing new infrastructure to the centre of the city.{{sfn|Raymond|2000|pp=120–128}} Meanwhile, Cairo flourished as a centre of [[Islamic studies|Islamic scholarship]] and a crossroads on the [[spice trade]] route among the civilisations in [[Afro-Eurasia]].{{sfn|Shillington|2005|p=199}} Under the reign of the Mamluk sultan [[An-Nasir Muhammad|al-Nasir Muhammad]] (1293–1341, with [[interregnum]]s), Cairo reached its apogee in terms of population and wealth.{{Sfn|Raymond|1993|p=122-124, 140-142}} By 1340, Cairo had a population of close to half a million, making it the largest city west of [[Yuan Dynasty|China]].{{sfn|Shillington|2005|p=199}}

Multi-story buildings occupied by [[Renting|rental]] apartments, known as a ''rab'<nowiki/>'' (plural ''ribā''' or ''urbu''), became common in the Mamluk period and continued to be a feature of the city's housing during the later Ottoman period.<ref name="Sayed-1987">{{Cite thesis |last=Sayed |first=Hazem I. |url=https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/75720 |title=The Rab' in Cairo: A Window on Mamluk Architecture and Urbanism |publisher=MIT |year=1987 |pages=7–9, 58 |hdl=1721.1/75720 |language=en |type=PhD thesis |access-date=11 June 2022 |archive-date=5 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230105105118/https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/75720 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{Sfn|Raymond|2000|p=123, 157}} These apartments were often laid out as multi-story [[Duplex (building)|duplexes]] or triplexes.

Though the plagues returned frequently throughout the 15th century, Cairo remained a major metropolis and its population recovered in part through [[Urbanization|rural migration]].{{Sfn|Raymond|1993|pp=169-177}} More conscious efforts were conducted by rulers and city officials to redress the city's infrastructure and cleanliness.

Under the Ottomans, Cairo expanded south and west from its nucleus around the Citadel.{{sfn|Winter|1992|p=226}} The city was the second-largest in the empire, behind Constantinople, and, although migration was not the primary source of Cairo's growth, twenty percent of its population at the end of the 18th century consisted of religious minorities and foreigners from around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].{{sfn|Winter|1992|pp=226–227}} Still, when [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] arrived in Cairo in 1798, the city's population was less than 300,000, forty percent lower than it was at the height of Mamluk—and Cairene—influence in the mid-14th century.{{sfn|Shillington|2005|p=199}}{{sfn|Winter|1992|pp=226–227}}

Cairo itself [[Siege of Cairo|was besieged]] by a British and Ottoman force culminating with the French surrender on 22 June 1801.{{sfn|Sicker|2001|p=103}} The British vacated Egypt two years later, leaving the Ottomans, the Albanians, and the long-weakened [[Mamluk]]s jostling for control of the country.{{sfn|Sicker|2001|p=104}}{{sfn|Afaf Lutfi Sayyid-Marsot|1984|p=39}} Continued civil war allowed an Albanian named [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]] to ascend to the role of [[commander]] and eventually, with the approval of the [[ulema|religious establishment]], viceroy of Egypt in 1805.{{sfn|Sicker|2001|pp=104–105}}

Until his death in 1848, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]] instituted a number of social and economic reforms that earned him the title of founder of modern Egypt.{{sfn|Afaf Lutfi Sayyid-Marsot|1984|p=1}}{{sfn|McGregor|2006|p=53}} However, while Muhammad Ali initiated the construction of public buildings in the city,{{sfn|Shillington|2005|p=437}} those reforms had minimal effect on Cairo's landscape.{{sfn|Raymond|2000|pp=291, 302}} Bigger changes came to Cairo under [[Isma'il Pasha]] (r. 1863–1879), who continued the modernisation processes started by his grandfather.<ref>Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 76</ref> Drawing inspiration from [[Paris]], Isma'il envisioned a city of [[Tahrir Square|maidans]] and wide avenues; due to financial constraints, only some of them, in the area now composing [[Downtown Cairo]], came to fruition.{{sfn|Raymond|2000|pp=313–314}} Isma'il also sought to modernize the city, which was merging with neighbouring settlements, by establishing a [[public works]] ministry, bringing [[natural gas|gas]] and lighting to the city, and opening a theatre and opera house.{{sfn|Raymond|2000|pp=311–313}}{{sfn|Abu-Lughod|1965|pp=436–444}}

The immense debt resulting from Isma'il's projects provided a pretext for increasing European control, which culminated with the [[1882 Anglo-Egyptian War|British invasion]] in 1882.{{sfn|Shillington|2005|p=199}} The city's economic centre quickly moved west toward the [[Nile]], away from the historic [[Islamic Cairo]] section and toward the contemporary, European-style areas built by Isma'il.{{sfn|Abu-Lughod|1965|pp=429–431, 455–457}}{{sfn|Hourani|Khoury|Wilson|2004|p=317}} Europeans accounted for five percent of Cairo's population at the end of the 19th century, by which point they held most top governmental positions.{{sfn|Abu-Lughod|1965|p=431}}

In 1906 the [[Cairo Electric Railways & Heliopolis Oases Company|Heliopolis Oasis Company]] headed by the [[Belgians|Belgian]] industrialist [[Édouard Empain]] and his Egyptian counterpart [[Boghos Nubar]], built a suburb called [[Heliopolis, Cairo|Heliopolis]] (city of the sun in Greek) ten kilometers from the center of Cairo.{{Sfn|Raymond|2000|p=329}}{{Sfn|Elyachar|2005|p=56}} In 1905–1907 the northern part of the [[Gezira (Cairo)|Gezira]] island was developed by the Baehler Company into [[Zamalek]], which would later become Cairo's upscale "chic" neighbourhood.{{Sfn|Raymond|2000|p=328}} In 1906 construction began on Garden City, a neighbourhood of urban villas with gardens and curved streets.{{Sfn|Raymond|2000|p=328}}

The British occupation was intended to be temporary, but it lasted well into the 20th century.

====British occupation until 1956====
[[File:Cairo Street 1950's.tif|thumb|Everyday life in Cairo, 1950s]]

British troops remained in the country until 1956. During this time, urban Cairo, spurred by new bridges and transport links, continued to expand to include the upscale neighbourhoods of Garden City, Zamalek, and Heliopolis.{{sfn|Raymond|2000|pp=326–329}} Between 1882 and 1937, the population of Cairo more than tripled—from 347,000 to 1.3 million{{sfn|Raymond|2000|p=319}}—and its area increased from {{cvt|10|to|163|km2|sqmi|0}}.{{sfn|Raymond|2000|p=322}}

The city was devastated during the 1952 riots known as the [[Cairo Fire]] or Black Saturday, which saw the destruction of nearly 700 shops, movie theatres, casinos and hotels in downtown Cairo.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.ahram.org.eg/433/2011/02/04/457/55/Malafat.aspx |script-title=ar:خسائر الحريق |date=12 May 2010 |journal=[[Al-Ahram]] |trans-title=The Fire Damage |language=ar |access-date=4 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512021201/http://www.ahram.org.eg/433/2011/02/04/457/55/Malafat.aspx |archive-date=12 May 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The British departed Cairo following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]], but the city's rapid growth showed no signs of abating. Seeking to accommodate the increasing population, [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] redeveloped [[Tahrir Square]] and the Nile [[Corniche]], and improved the city's network of bridges and highways.{{sfn|Raymond|2000|p=349}} Meanwhile, additional controls of the Nile fostered development within Gezira Island and along the city's waterfront. The metropolis began to encroach on the fertile [[Nile Delta]], prompting the government to build desert [[satellite town]]s and devise incentives for city-dwellers to move to them.{{sfn|Raymond|2000|pp=343–345}}

====After 1956====
In the second half of the 20th century Cairo continue to grow enormously in both population and area. Between 1947 and 2006 the population of [[Greater Cairo]] went from 2,986,280 to 16,292,269.{{Sfn|Sims|2012|p=83}} The population explosion also drove the rise of "informal" housing (''<nowiki/>'ashwa'iyyat''), meaning housing that was built without any official planning or control.{{Sfn|Sims|2012|p=95}} The exact form of this type of housing varies considerably but usually has a much higher population density than formal housing. By 2009, over 63% of the population of Greater Cairo lived in informal neighbourhoods, even though these occupied only 17% of the total area of Greater Cairo.{{Sfn|Sims|2012|p=96}} According to economist David Sims, informal housing has the benefits of providing affordable accommodation and vibrant communities to huge numbers of Cairo's working classes, but it also suffers from government neglect, a relative lack of services, and overcrowding.{{Sfn|Sims|2012|pp=120-122}}

The "formal" city was also expanded. The most notable example was the creation of [[Nasr City|Madinat Nasr]], a huge government-sponsored expansion of the city to the east which officially began in 1959 but was primarily developed in the mid-1970s.{{Sfn|Sims|2012|pp=52-53}} Starting in 1977 the Egyptian government established the New Urban Communities Authority to initiate and direct the development of new planned cities on the outskirts of Cairo, generally established on desert land.<ref name="Ali-2020">{{Cite book |last=Ali |first=Amal K. |title=The Routledge Handbook of Planning Megacities in the Global South |publisher=Routledge |year=2020 |isbn=978-1-000-06205-2 |editor-last=Rukmana |editor-first=Deden |pages=337–339 |language=en |chapter=Challenges in Managing Urban Growth: The Case of Cairo |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=InnpDwAAQBAJ&dq=badr+city+cairo&pg=PT364}}</ref><ref name="UNECA-2017">{{Cite book |last=United Nations Economic Commission for Africa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cTHLDwAAQBAJ&dq=cairo+first+generation+cities&pg=PA150 |title=Economic Report on Africa 2017: Urbanization and Industrialization for Africa's Transformation |publisher=United Nations |year=2017 |isbn=978-92-1-060392-8 |pages=150 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Sims |first=David |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWtjEAAAQBAJ |title=Egypt's Desert Dreams: Development or Disaster? |publisher=American University in Cairo Press |year=2018 |isbn=978-1-61797-884-5 |language=en|edition=New }}</ref> These new satellite cities were intended to provide housing, investment, and employment opportunities for the region's growing population as well as to pre-empt the further growth of informal neighbourhoods.<ref name="Ali-2020" /> As of 2014, about 10% of the population of Greater Cairo lived in the new cities.<ref name="Ali-2020" />

Concurrently, Cairo established itself as a political and economic hub for [[North Africa]] and the [[Arab world]], with many multinational businesses and organisations, including the [[Arab League]], operating out of the city. In 1979 the [[Islamic Cairo|historic districts]] of Cairo were listed as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref name="UNESCO-2017" />

Until the mid-19th century, when the river was tamed by dams, levees, and other controls, the Nile in the vicinity of Cairo was highly susceptible to changes in course and surface level. Over the years, the Nile gradually shifted westward, providing the site between the eastern edge of the river and the [[Mokattam]] highlands on which the city now stands. The land on which Cairo was established in 969 (present-day [[Islamic Cairo]]) was located underwater just over three hundred years earlier, when [[Fustat]] was first built.{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=125}}

Low periods of the Nile during the 11th century continued to add to the landscape of Cairo; a new island, known as ''Geziret al-Fil'', first appeared in 1174, but eventually became connected to the mainland. Today, the site of ''Geziret al-Fil'' is occupied by the [[Shubra]] district. The low periods created another island at the turn of the 14th century that now composes [[Zamalek]] and [[Gezira (Cairo)|Gezira]]. [[Land reclamation]] efforts by the [[Mamluk]]s and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] further contributed to expansion on the east bank of the river.{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=126}}

Because of the Nile's movement, the newer parts of the city—[[Garden City (Cairo)|Garden City]], [[Downtown Cairo]], and Zamalek—are located closest to the riverbank.<ref name="riverbank">{{cite web |url=http://geography.about.com/od/egyptmaps/a/cairo-geography.htm |title=Ten Facts about Cairo, Egypt |author=Amanda Briney |date=20 February 2011 |work=Geography of Cairo |publisher=About.com |access-date=14 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328101627/http://geography.about.com/od/egyptmaps/a/cairo-geography.htm |archive-date=28 March 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> The areas, which are home to most of Cairo's [[diplomatic mission|embassies]], are surrounded on the north, east, and south by the older parts of the city. [[Old Cairo]], located south of the centre, holds the remnants of [[Fustat]] and the heart of Egypt's [[Coptic Orthodox Church|Coptic Christian]] community, [[Coptic Cairo]]. The [[Boulaq]] district, which lies in the northern part of the city, was born out of a major 16th-century port and is now a major industrial centre. The Citadel is located east of the city centre around [[Islamic Cairo]], which dates back to the Fatimid era and the foundation of Cairo. While western Cairo is dominated by wide boulevards, open spaces, and [[modern architecture]] of European influence, the eastern half, having grown haphazardly over the centuries, is dominated by small lanes, crowded tenements, and [[Islamic architecture]].

Northern and extreme eastern parts of Cairo, which include [[satellite town]]s, are among the most recent additions to the city, as they developed in the late-20th and early-21st centuries to accommodate the city's rapid growth. The western bank of the Nile is commonly included within the urban area of Cairo, but it composes the city of [[Giza]] and the [[Giza Governorate]].

[[File:Cairo weather observations by French savants.jpg|thumb|Cairo weather observations by French savants]]

In Cairo, and along the Nile River Valley, the climate is a [[hot desert climate]] (''BWh'' according to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system<ref>{{cite web |url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/pics/kottek_et_al_2006.gif |title=World Map of Köppen-Geiger Climate Classification |publisher=Köppen-Geiger |access-date=22 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017125921/http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/pics/kottek_et_al_2006.gif |archive-date=17 October 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>).

Wind storms can be frequent, bringing [[Mineral dust|Saharan dust]] into the city, from March to May and the air often becomes uncomfortably dry. Winters are mild to warm, while summers are long and hot. High temperatures in winter range from {{cvt|14|to|22|°C|0}}, while night-time lows drop to below {{cvt|11|°C|0}}, often to {{cvt|5|°C|0}}. In summer, the highs often exceed {{cvt|31|°C|0}} but rarely surpass {{cvt|40|°C|0}}, and lows drop to about {{cvt|20|°C|0}}. Rainfall is sparse and only happens in the colder months, but sudden showers can cause severe flooding. The summer months have high humidity due to its coastal location. Snowfall is extremely rare; a small amount of [[graupel]], widely believed to be [[snow]], fell on Cairo's easternmost suburbs on 13 December 2013, the first time Cairo's area received this kind of precipitation in many decades.<ref>{{cite news |title=Biblical snowstorm: Rare flakes in Cairo, Jerusalem paralyzed by over a foot |first=Jason |last=Samenow |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=13 December 2013 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2013/12/13/rare-snow-in-cairo-jerusalem-paralyzed-in-historic-snow/ |access-date=22 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903233952/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2013/12/13/rare-snow-in-cairo-jerusalem-paralyzed-in-historic-snow/ |archive-date=3 September 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> Dew points in the hottest months range from {{cvt|13.9|°C|0}} in June to {{cvt|18.3|°C|0}} in August.<ref name=NOAA>{{cite web |url=ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/RA-VI/BH/14654.TXT |title=Sarajevo Climate Normals 1961–1990 |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |access-date=25 August 2016 }}{{dead link|date=June 2022|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Cairo is a city-state where the governor is also the head of the city. Cairo City itself differs from other Egyptian cities in that it has an extra [[Local Government in Egypt|administrative division]] between the city and district levels, and that is areas, which are headed by deputy governors. Cairo consists of 4 areas ''(manatiq, singl. mantiqa)'' divided into 38 districts ''(ahya', singl. hayy)'' and 46 qisms (police wards, 1-2 per district):<ref>{{Cite web |title=Areas |url=http://www.cairo.gov.eg/en/Pages/Regions.aspx?SubmID=141 |access-date=2022-12-22 |website=Cairo Governorate |archive-date=7 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221207130230/http://www.cairo.gov.eg/en/Pages/Regions.aspx?SubmID=141 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Since 1977 a number of [[Planned community|new towns]] have been planned and built by the [[New Urban Communities Authority]] (NUCA) in the [[Eastern Desert]] around Cairo, ostensibly  to accommodate additional population growth and development of the city and stem the development of self-built informal areas, especially over agricultural land. As of 2022 four new towns have been built and have residential populations: [[15th of May (city)|15th of May City]], [[Badr City]], [[El Shorouk City|Shorouk City]], and [[New Cairo]]. In addition, two more are under construction: the [[New Administrative Capital]].<ref name="Ali-2020a">{{Cite book |last=Ali |first=Amal K. |title=The Routledge Handbook of Planning Megacities in the Global South |publisher=Routledge |year=2020 |isbn=978-1-000-06205-2 |editor-last=Rukmana |editor-first=Deden |pages=337–339 |language=en |chapter=Challenges in Managing Urban Growth: The Case of Cairo |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=InnpDwAAQBAJ&dq=badr+city+cairo&pg=PT364}}</ref><ref name="UNECA-2017a">{{Cite book |last=United Nations Economic Commission for Africa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cTHLDwAAQBAJ&dq=cairo+first+generation+cities&pg=PA150 |title=Economic Report on Africa 2017: Urbanization and Industrialization for Africa's Transformation |publisher=United Nations |year=2017 |isbn=978-92-1-060392-8 |pages=150 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Cambanis |first=Thanassis |date=24 August 2010 |title=To Catch Cairo Overflow, 2 Megacities Rise in Sand |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/25/world/africa/25egypt.html |url-access=subscription |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311041220/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/25/world/africa/25egypt.html |archive-date=11 March 2017}}</ref> And Capital Gardens, where land was allocated in 2021, and which will house most of the civil servants employed in the new capital.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Capital Gardens |url=http://www.newcities.gov.eg/know_cities/Capital_Gardens/default.aspx |access-date=2022-12-30 |website=New Urban Communities Authority |archive-date=30 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221230205031/http://www.newcities.gov.eg/know_cities/Capital_Gardens/default.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:National Bank of Egypt.JPG|thumb|right|The [[National Bank of Egypt|NBE]] towers as viewed from the Nile]]
[[File:Street Vendors of Cairo (Full).webm|thumb|Informal economy in Cairo]]

Cairo's economy has traditionally been based on governmental institutions and services, with the modern productive sector expanding in the 20th century to include developments in textiles and food processing – specifically the production of [[sugar cane]]. As of 2005, Egypt has the largest non-oil based GDP in the Arab world. {{sfn|UN-Habitat|2011|page=20-21}}

Cairo accounts for 11% of Egypt's population and 22% of its economy (PPP). The majority of the nation's commerce is generated there, or passes through the city. The great majority of [[publishing|publishing houses]] and media outlets and nearly all [[Movie studio|film studios]] are there, as are half of the nation's hospital beds and universities. This has fuelled rapid construction in the city, with one building in five being less than 15 years old.{{sfn|UN-Habitat|2011|page=20-21}}

This growth until recently surged well ahead of [[Municipal services|city services]]. Homes, roads, electricity, telephone and sewer services were all in short supply. Analysts trying to grasp the magnitude of the change coined terms like "hyper-urbanization".{{sfn|UN-Habitat|2011|page=20-21}}

Cairo, as well as neighbouring Giza, has been established as Egypt's main centre for medical treatment, and despite some exceptions, has the most advanced level of [[Health care|medical care]] in the country. Cairo's hospitals include the [[Joint Commission|JCI]]-accredited [[As-Salaam International Hospital]],<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.esmo.org/for-patients/esmo-designated-centres-of-integrated-oncology-palliative-care/esmo-accredited-designated-centres/as-salam-international-hospital#:~:text=The%20hospital%20has%20been%20Joint,culture%20is%20provided%20for | title=As-Salam International Hospital &#124; Cairo }}</ref> [[Ain Shams University]] Hospital,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.asu.edu.eg/healthcare#:~:text=Ain%20Shams%20University%20chooses%20Ain,26831231 | title=Ain Shams university }}</ref> [[Dar Al Fouad]],<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.daralfouad.org/__top-hospital-in-egypt-jci#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20Dar%20Al%20Fouad,renewed%20for%20the%20second%20time | title=Dar al Fouad Hospital &#124; Leading hospital in Egypt and Middle East }}</ref> [[Nile Badrawi Hospital]], [[57357 Hospital]],<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.57357.org/en/category/honor-and-prizes/57357/#:~:text=Hospital%205357%20is%20proud%20to,for%20Africa%20November%2024%2C%202019 | title=Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt 57357(CCHE) website }}</ref> as well as [[Qasr El Eyni Hospital]].

===Education===
[[Greater Cairo]] has long been the hub of education and educational services for Egypt and the region.

Today, Greater Cairo is the centre for many government offices governing the [[Education in Egypt|Egyptian educational system]], has the largest number of educational schools, and [[Egyptian universities|higher education institutes]] among other cities and governorates of Egypt.

Cairo has an extensive road network, [[rail system]], [[Rapid transit|subway system]] and maritime services. Road transport is facilitated by personal vehicles, taxi cabs, privately owned public buses and [[Microbus#Van conversions|microbuses]]. [[Cairo International Airport]] is the country's largest airport and one of the busiest airports in Africa.<ref>{{Cite book |last= |first= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-dcVBgAAQBAJ&dq=egypt+busiest+airport&pg=PA133 |title=The Report: Egypt 2013 |publisher=Oxford Business Group |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-907065-91-0 |pages=133 |language=en |access-date=6 June 2023 |archive-date=6 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230606215645/https://books.google.com/books?id=-dcVBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA133&dq=egypt+busiest+airport&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiIkNb_z6__AhU0kYkEHTaQC8EQ6AF6BAgCEAI#v=onepage&q=egypt%20busiest%20airport&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Public transportation ===
[[File:Ramses-Station.jpg|thumb|The interior of [[Ramses Station]]]]Cairo, specifically [[Ramses Station]], is the centre of almost the entire Egyptian transportation network.<ref name="TravelCairo">{{Cite book |title=Travel Cairo |year=2007 |publisher=MobileReference |isbn=978-1-60501-055-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=50O9dQlwreYC&pg=PT44 |page=44 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

The [[Cairo Transportation Authority]] (CTA) manages Cairo's public transit. The subway system, the [[Cairo Metro]], is a fast and efficient way of getting around Cairo. The metro network covers [[Helwan]] and other suburbs. It can get very crowded during [[rush hour]]. Two train cars (the fourth and fifth ones) are reserved for women only, although women may ride in any car they want.

[[Trams in Greater Cairo]] and Cairo trolleybus were used as modes of transportation, but were closed in the 1970s everywhere except Heliopolis and Helwan. These were shut down in 2014, after the Egyptian Revolution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cairobserver.com/post/30531431811/on-cairos-dying-trams |title=On Cairo's dying trams |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=30 August 2012 |website=cairobserver.com |access-date=1 August 2021 |archive-date=28 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128184112/http://cairobserver.com/post/30531431811/on-cairos-dying-trams |url-status=live }}</ref>

Two trans-African automobile routes originate in Cairo: the [[Cairo-Cape Town Highway]] and the [[Cairo-Dakar Highway]]. An extensive road network connects Cairo with other Egyptian cities and villages. There is a new [[Ring road|Ring Road]] that surrounds the outskirts of the city, with exits that reach outer Cairo districts. There are flyovers and bridges, such as the [[6th October Bridge]] that, when the traffic is not heavy, allow fast means of transportation from one side of the city to the other.<ref name="TravelCairo" />

Cairo traffic is known to be overwhelming and overcrowded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/779/feature.htm |work=Al-Ahram Weekly |title = Reaching an impasse |publisher=Weekly.ahram.org.eg |date=1 February 2006 |access-date= |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420135315/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/779/feature.htm |archive-date=20 April 2009|author = Reem Leila}}</ref> Traffic moves at a relatively fluid pace.

===Cairo Opera House===
{{Main|Cairo Opera House}}

[[President Mubarak]] inaugurated the new Cairo Opera House of the Egyptian National Cultural Centres on 10 October 1988, 17 years after the Royal Opera House had been destroyed by fire. The National Cultural Centre was built with the help of [[JICA]], the Japan International Co-operation Agency and stands as a prominent feature for the [[Egypt–Japan relations|Japanese-Egyptian co-operation]] and the friendship between the two nations.

===Khedivial Opera House===
{{Main|Khedivial Opera House}}

The [[Khedivial Opera House]], or Royal Opera House, was the original opera house in Cairo. It was dedicated on 1 November 1869 and burned down on 28 October 1971. After the original opera house was destroyed, Cairo was without an opera house for nearly two decades until the opening of the new Cairo Opera House in 1988.

===Cairo International Film Festival===
{{Main|Cairo International Film Festival}}

Cairo held its first international [[film festival]] 16 August 1976, when the first [[Cairo International Film Festival]] was launched by the Egyptian Association of Film Writers and Critics, headed by Kamal El-Mallakh. The Association ran the festival for seven years until 1983.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cairo International Film Festival - Short Film Competition |url=https://filmfreeway.com/CairoInternationalFilmFestival |access-date=2023-12-11 |website=FilmFreeway |language=en}}</ref>

This achievement lead to the President of the Festival again contacting the [[FIAPF]] with the request that a competition should be included at the 1991 Festival. The request was granted.

In 1998, the Festival took place under the presidency of one of Egypt's leading actors, [[Hussein Fahmy]], who was appointed by the [[Ministry of Culture (Egypt)|Minister of Culture]], [[Farouk Hosny|Farouk Hosni]], after the death of Saad El-Din Wahba. Four years later, the journalist and writer Cherif El-Shoubashy became president.

[[File:Solomon Schechter studying the fragments of the Cairo Genizah, c. 1898.jpg|thumb|[[Solomon Schechter]] at work in Cambridge University Library, studying the fragments of the [[Cairo Geniza]], {{Circa|1898}}]]

The Cairo Geniza is an accumulation of almost 200,000 Jewish manuscripts that were found in the ''[[genizah]]'' of the [[Ben Ezra Synagogue]] (built 882) of Fustat, Egypt (now Old Cairo), the Basatin cemetery east of Old Cairo, and a number of old documents that were bought in Cairo in the later 19th century. These documents were written from about 870 to 1880 AD and have been archived in various American and European libraries. The Taylor-Schechter collection in the [[University of Cambridge]] runs to 140,000 manuscripts; a further 40,000 manuscripts are housed at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]].

The annual match between Al Ahly and El Zamalek is one of the most watched sports events in Egypt. The teams form the major rivalry of Egyptian football. They play their home games at [[Cairo International Stadium]], which is the second largest stadium in Egypt, as well as the largest in Cairo.

The Cairo International Stadium was built in 1960. Its multi-purpose sports complex houses the main football stadium, an [[Cairo Stadium Indoor Halls Complex|indoor stadium]], satellite fields that hold regional and continental games, including the [[All-Africa Games|African Games]], U17 Football World Championship and the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations]]. Egypt later won the competition and the next edition in Ghana (2008) making the Egyptian and Ghanaian national teams the only to win the African Nations Cup back to back.

===Tahrir Square===
{{Main|Tahrir Square}}
[[File:TahrirSQ-2020(2).jpg|thumb|View of [[Tahrir Square]] (in 2020)|alt=]]

Tahrir Square was founded during the mid 19th century with the establishment of modern downtown Cairo. It was first named Ismailia Square, after the 19th-century ruler Khedive Ismail, who commissioned the new downtown district's 'Paris on the Nile' design. After the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919]] the square became widely known as Tahrir (Liberation) Square, though it was not officially renamed as such until after the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|1952 Revolution]] which eliminated the monarchy. Several notable buildings surround the square including, the American University in Cairo's downtown campus, the [[Mogamma]] governmental administrative Building, the headquarters of the [[Arab League]], the Nile Ritz Carlton Hotel, and the [[Egyptian Museum]]. Being at the heart of Cairo, the square witnessed several major protests over the years. However, the most notable event in the square was being the focal point of the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution]] against former president Hosni Mubarak.<ref>{{cite book |author=Vatikiotis, Panayiotis J. |title=The Middle East: From the End of Empire to the End of the Cold War |url=https://archive.org/details/middleeastfromen0000vati |url-access=registration |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |page=[https://archive.org/details/middleeastfromen0000vati/page/194 194] |isbn=9780415158497}}</ref> In 2020 the government completed the erection of a new monument in the center of the square featuring an ancient [[obelisk]] from the reign of [[Ramesses II|Ramses II]], originally unearthed at [[Tanis]] (San al-Hagar) in 2019, and four ram-headed [[sphinx]] statues moved from [[Karnak]].<ref name="Michaelson-2020">{{Cite web |date=2020-05-07 |title=Egyptologists attack transfer of sphinxes to Tahrir Square |url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/egyptologists-pan-transfer-of-sphinxes-to-tahrir-square |access-date=2022-06-08 |website=the Guardian |language=en |archive-date=21 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220521074748/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/egyptologists-pan-transfer-of-sphinxes-to-tahrir-square |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-02-16 |title=Tahrir Square soon to boast ancient obelisk and stone rams |url=https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/6/81712/Tahrir-Square-soon-to-boast-ancient-obelisk-and-stone-rams |access-date=2022-06-08 |website=EgyptToday |archive-date=29 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220529062935/https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/6/81712/Tahrir-Square-soon-to-boast-ancient-obelisk-and-stone-rams |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last1=Magazine |first1=Smithsonian |last2=Machemer |first2=Theresa |title=Egypt Defies Archaeologists' Protests by Relocating Four Ancient Sphinxes |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/egypt-relocated-four-ancient-sphinxes-despite-archaeologist-protests-180974844/ |access-date=2022-06-08 |website=Smithsonian Magazine |language=en |archive-date=23 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220123113411/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/egypt-relocated-four-ancient-sphinxes-despite-archaeologist-protests-180974844/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Old Cairo===

This area of Cairo is so-named as it contains the remains of the ancient Roman fortress of Babylon and also overlaps the original site of Fustat, the first Arab settlement in Egypt (7th century AD) and the predecessor of later Cairo. The area includes Coptic Cairo, which holds a high concentration of old Christian churches such as the [[Hanging Church]], the [[Church of St. George (Cairo)|Greek Orthodox Church of St. George]], and other Christian or Coptic buildings, most of which are located in an enclave on the site of the ancient Roman fortress. It is also the location of the [[Coptic Museum]], which showcases the history of [[Coptic art]] from Greco-Roman to Islamic times, and of the [[Ben Ezra Synagogue]], the oldest and best-known [[synagogue]] in Cairo, where the important collection of Geniza documents were discovered in the 19th century.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=43}}

Cairo holds one of the greatest concentrations of historical monuments of [[Islamic architecture]] in the world.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p={{page needed|date=March 2022}}}} The areas around the old walled city and around the Citadel are characterized by hundreds of mosques, tombs, [[madrasas]], mansions, [[caravanserais]], and fortifications dating from the Islamic era and are often referred to as "[[Islamic Cairo]]", especially in English travel literature.<ref>e.g. {{harvnb|O'Neill et al|2012|}}</ref> It is also the location of several important religious shrines such as the [[al-Hussein Mosque]] (whose shrine is believed to hold the head of [[Husayn ibn Ali]]), the Mausoleum of Imam [[al-Shafi'i]] (founder of the [[Shafi'i]] ''[[madhhab]]'', one of the primary schools of thought in Sunni Islamic [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]]), the [[Mashhad of Sayyida Ruqayya|Tomb of Sayyida Ruqayya]], the [[Al-Sayeda Nafeesah Mosque|Mosque of Sayyida Nafisa]], and others.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=}}

The first mosque in Egypt was the Mosque of Amr ibn al-As in what was formerly Fustat, the first Arab-Muslim settlement in the area. However, the Mosque of Ibn Tulun is the oldest mosque that still retains its original form and is a rare example of Abbasid architecture from the [[Islamic Golden Age|classical period of Islamic civilization]]. It was built in 876–879 AD in a style inspired by the Abbasid capital of [[Samarra]] in [[Iraq]].{{sfn|Williams|2008|pp=50–54}} It is one of the largest mosques in Cairo and is often cited as one of the most beautiful.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=50}}{{sfn|O'Neill et al|2012|p=87}} Another Abbasid construction, the [[Nilometer]] on Roda Island, is the oldest original structure in Cairo, built in 862 AD. It was designed to measure the level of the [[Nile]], which was important for agricultural and administrative purposes.<ref>Yeomans, Richard. 2006. ''The Art and Architecture of Islamic Cairo''. Garnet Publishing, p 29.</ref>

The settlement that was formally named Cairo (Arabic: ''al-Qahira'') was founded to the northeast of Fustat in 959 AD by the victorious Fatimid army. The Fatimids built it as a separate palatial city which contained their palaces and institutions of government. It was enclosed by a circuit of walls, which were rebuilt in stone in the late 11th century AD by the vizier Badr al-Gamali,{{sfn|Raymond|1993|p=62}} parts of which survive today at Bab Zuwayla in the south and Bab al-Futuh and Bab al-Nasr in the north. Among the extant monuments from the Fatimid era are the large [[Al-Hakim Mosque|Mosque of al-Hakim]], the [[Aqmar Mosque]], [[Juyushi Mosque]], [[Lulua Mosque]], and the [[Al-Salih Tala'i Mosque|Mosque of Al-Salih Tala'i]].{{Sfn|Behrens-Abouseif|1992|pp=58-77}}{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=}}

One of the most important and lasting institutions founded in the Fatimid period was the Mosque of al-Azhar, founded in 970 AD, which competes with the [[Qarawiyyin]] in [[Fes]] for the title of oldest university in the world.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=169}} Today, al-Azhar University is the foremost Center of Islamic learning in the world and one of Egypt's largest universities with campuses across the country.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=169}} The mosque itself retains significant Fatimid elements but has been added to and expanded in subsequent centuries, notably by the Mamluk sultans Qaytbay and al-Ghuri and by Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda in the 18th century.{{Sfn|Behrens-Abouseif|1992|pp=62}}

The most prominent architectural heritage of medieval Cairo, however, dates from the Mamluk period, from 1250 to 1517 AD. The Mamluk sultans and elites were eager patrons of religious and scholarly life, commonly building religious or funerary complexes whose functions could include a mosque, madrasa, [[khanqah]] (for [[Sufis]]), a [[Sebil (fountain)|sabil]] (water dispensary), and a mausoleum for themselves and their families.<ref name="Behrens-2007">Behrens-Abouseif, Doris. 2007. ''Cairo of the Mamluks: A History of Architecture and its Culture''. Cairo: The American University in Cairo Press.</ref> Among the best-known examples of Mamluk monuments in Cairo are the huge Mosque-Madrasa of Sultan Hasan, the [[Mosque of Amir al-Maridani]], the [[Mosque of Sultan al-Muayyad|Mosque of Sultan al-Mu'ayyad]] (whose twin minarets were built above the gate of Bab Zuwayla), the [[Sultan Al-Ghuri Complex|Sultan Al-Ghuri complex]], the [[Complex of Sultan al-Ashraf Qaytbay|funerary complex of Sultan Qaytbay]] in the [[City of the Dead (Cairo)|Northern Cemetery]], and the trio of monuments in the [[Bayn al-Qasrayn]] area comprising the [[Qalawun complex|complex of Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun]], the [[Madrassa of Al-Nasir Muhammad|Madrasa of al-Nasir Muhammad]], and the [[Madrasa of Sultan Barquq]].

The Mamluks, and the later Ottomans, also built ''wikala''s or caravanserais to house merchants and goods due to the important role of trade and commerce in Cairo's economy.{{sfn|Raymond|1993|pp=90–97}} Still intact today is the [[Wikala of Al-Ghuri|Wikala al-Ghuri]], which today hosts regular performances by the Al-[[Tannoura]] Egyptian Heritage Dance Troupe.{{sfn|O'Neill et al|2012|p=81}} The [[Khan el-Khalili|Khan al-Khalili]] is a commercial hub which also integrated caravanserais (also known as ''khan''s).<ref name="Denoix-1999a">{{Cite book |title=Le Khan al-Khalili et ses environs: Un centre commercial et artisanal au Caire du XIIIe au XXe siècle |publisher=Institut français d'archéologie orientale |year=1999 |editor-last=Denoix |editor-first=Sylvie |location=Cairo |editor-last2=Depaule |editor-first2=Jean-Charles |editor-last3=Tuchscherer |editor-first3=Michel}}</ref>

[[Khan el-Khalili]] is an ancient [[bazaar]], or marketplace adjacent to the [[Al-Hussein Mosque]]. It dates back to 1385, when Amir Jarkas el-Khalili built a large caravanserai, or khan. (A caravanserai is a hotel for traders, and usually the focal point for any surrounding area.) This original caravanserai building was demolished by [[qansuh al-Ghuri|Sultan al-Ghuri]], who rebuilt it as a new commercial complex in the early 16th century, forming the basis for the network of [[souqs]] existing today.{{sfn|Raymond|1993|p=179}} Many medieval elements remain today, including the ornate [[Mamluk]]-style gateways.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=179}} Today, the Khan el-Khalili is a major tourist attraction and popular stop for tour groups.{{sfn|O'Neill et al|2012|pp=74–75}}

A 2013 [[United Nations|UN]] study found that over 99% of [[Women in Egypt|Egyptian women]] reported experiencing sexual harassment at some point in their lives.<ref>United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerement of Women,   [https://www.eisf.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2172-UN-Women-2013-Study-on-Ways-and-Methods-to-Eliminate-Sexual-Harassment-in-Egypt.pdf Study on Ways and Methods to Eliminate Sexual Harassment in Egypt] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210528205636/https://gisf.ngo/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2172-UN-Women-2013-Study-on-Ways-and-Methods-to-Eliminate-Sexual-Harassment-in-Egypt.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200729170507/https://gisf.ngo/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2172-UN-Women-2013-Study-on-Ways-and-Methods-to-Eliminate-Sexual-Harassment-in-Egypt.pdf |archive-date=2020-07-29 |url-status=live |date=28 May 2021 }}</ref> The problem has persisted in spite of new national laws since 2014 defining and criminalizing sexual harassment.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-27726849 |title=Egypt brings in new sex assault laws |date=2014-06-05 |work=BBC News |access-date=2020-03-11 |language=en-GB |archive-date=12 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012162357/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-27726849 |url-status=live}}</ref> The situation is so severe that in 2017, Cairo was named by one poll as the most dangerous [[megacity]] for women in the world.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-41637383 |title=Cairo 'most dangerous' city for women |date=2017-10-16 |work=BBC News |access-date=2020-03-11 |language=en-GB |archive-date=5 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200305110340/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-41637383 |url-status=live}}</ref> In 2020, the social media account "Assault Police" began to name and shame perpetrators of violence against women, in an effort to dissuade potential offenders.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Walsh |first=Declan |date=2020-10-02 |title=The 22-Year-Old Force Behind Egypt's Growing #MeToo Movement |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/world/middleeast/egypt-metoo-sexual-harassment-ashraf.html |access-date=2021-01-09 |issn=0362-4331 |archive-date=11 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210311144311/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/world/middleeast/egypt-metoo-sexual-harassment-ashraf.html |url-status=live}}</ref> The account was founded by student [[Nadeen Ashraf]], who is credited for instigating an iteration of the [[Me Too movement|#MeToo movement]] in Egypt.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Egypt's #MeToo Activists See Progress, but 'the Road Ahead Is Long' |url=https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/29295/in-egypt-women-s-rights-activists-see-progress-but-the-road-ahead-is-long |access-date=2021-01-09 |website=www.worldpoliticsreview.com |date=17 December 2020 |language=en |archive-date=11 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210311144312/https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/29295/in-egypt-women-s-rights-activists-see-progress-but-the-road-ahead-is-long |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Pollution==
[[File:NilPollution.jpg|thumb|Smog in Cairo]]
[[File:Cairo Traffic.jpg|thumb|Traffic in Cairo]]

The [[air pollution]] in Cairo is a matter of serious concern. Greater Cairo's volatile [[aromatic hydrocarbon]] levels are higher than many other similar cities.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Khoder |first=M.I. |title=Ambient levels of volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere of Greater Cairo |journal=Atmospheric Environment |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=554–66 |date=January 2007 |doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2006.08.051 |issn=1352-2310 |bibcode=2007AtmEn..41..554K}}<!-- |access-date=1 January 2007 --></ref> Air quality measurements in Cairo have also been recording dangerous levels of [[lead]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[sulfur dioxide|sulphur dioxide]], and [[suspended solids|suspended particulate matter]] concentrations due to decades of unregulated [[vehicle emissions control|vehicle emissions]], urban industrial operations, and chaff and trash burning. There are over 4,500,000 cars on the streets of Cairo, 60% of which are over 10 years old, and therefore lack modern emission cutting features. Cairo has a very poor dispersion factor because of its lack of rain and its layout of tall buildings and narrow streets, which create a bowl effect.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blog.theecoexperts.co.uk/most-polluted-cities |title=The Most Polluted Cities in the World |publisher=The Eco Experts |first=Fran |last=Whittaker-Wood |date=25 July 2018 |access-date=2 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701230800/https://blog.theecoexperts.co.uk/most-polluted-cities |archive-date=1 July 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In recent years, a black cloud (as Egyptians refer to it) of [[smog]]  has appeared over Cairo every autumn due to [[Inversion (meteorology)|temperature inversion]]. Smog causes serious respiratory diseases and eye irritations for the city's citizens. Tourists who are not familiar with such high levels of pollution must take extra care.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Black cloud reappears over Cairo |journal=Middle East Online |volume=41 |issue=3 |page=554 |doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2006.08.051 |author=Khoder, M |year=2007 |bibcode=2007AtmEn..41..554K}}</ref>

Cairo also has many unregistered lead and [[copper]] [[smelter]]s which heavily pollute the city. The results of this has been a permanent haze over the city with [[particulate matter]] in the air reaching over three times normal levels. It is estimated that 10,000 to 25,000 people a year in Cairo die due to air pollution-related diseases. Lead has been shown to cause harm to the [[central nervous system]] and neurotoxicity particularly in children.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Lead neurotoxicity in children: basic mechanisms and clinical correlates |journal=Brain |volume=126 |issue=1 |pages=5–19 |date=January 2003 |doi=10.1093/brain/awg014 |author=Lidsky, T. I. |pmid=12477693 |last2=Schneider |first2=JS |doi-access=free}}</ref> In 1995, the first environmental acts were introduced and the situation has seen some improvement with 36 air monitoring stations and [[Emissions testing|emissions tests]] on cars. Twenty thousand buses have also been commissioned to the city to improve congestion levels, which are very high.<ref>[https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/sensing-our-planet/a-black-cloud-over-cairo A black cloud over Cairo] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201016182202/https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/sensing-our-planet/a-black-cloud-over-cairo |date=16 October 2020 }} NASA</ref>

The city also suffers from a high level of land pollution. Cairo produces 10,000 tons of waste material each day, 4,000 tons of which is not [[Waste collection|collected]] or [[Waste management|managed]]. This is a huge health hazard, and the Egyptian Government is looking for ways to combat this. The Cairo Cleaning and Beautification Agency was founded to collect and recycle the waste; they work with the [[Zabbaleen]]  community that has been collecting and recycling Cairo's waste since the turn of the 20th century and live in an area known locally as [[Manshiyat naser]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/06/03/MNGKOJ82991.DTL |title=From Cairo's trash, a model of recycling / Old door-to-door method boasts 85% reuse rate |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=3 June 2006 |access-date=5 May 2009 |first=Jack |last=Epstein |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010222736/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2006%2F06%2F03%2FMNGKOJ82991.DTL |archive-date=10 October 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> Both are working together to pick up as much waste as possible within the city limits, though it remains a pressing problem.

[[Water pollution]] is also a serious problem in the city as the [[Sanitary sewer|sewer system]] tends to fail and overflow. On occasion, [[sewage]] has escaped onto the streets to create a health hazard. This problem is hoped to be solved by a new sewer system funded by the [[European Union]], which could cope with the demand of the city.{{cn|date=October 2022}} The dangerously high levels of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] in the city's water system has [[global health]] officials concerned over related health risks.{{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}
