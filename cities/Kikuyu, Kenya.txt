'''Kikuyu''' is a town in [[Kiambu County, Kenya]], which grew from a settlement of colonial missionaries. The town is located about {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} northwest of central [[Nairobi]]. It is about 20 minutes from Nairobi via a number of routes, including a [[dual carriage road]],the Southern Bypass and has a railway station on the Mombasa – Malaba [[Uganda Railway|Railway]] Line. The town is named after the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu/Gĩkũyũ]] people, the major ethnicity that settled in the area. As of 2019, the total population was 323,881.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kenya.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/profiles/Kiambu_Dec2011%2029.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=13 August 2013 |archive-date=23 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223192732/http://kenya.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/profiles/Kiambu_Dec2011%2029.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Due to its geology and rich soil texture, the chief activities are livestock and crop farming. The jurisdiction also includes the [[Ondiri Wetland]] which is the source of the Nairobi River.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Friends of Ondiri Wetland Kenya {{!}} Home|url=https://friendsofondiriwetlands.org/|access-date=2021-07-27|website=friendsofondiriwetlands.org|archive-date=23 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210723055611/https://friendsofondiriwetlands.org/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Obura|first=Fredrick|title=Increased human activities threaten source of Nairobi River - FarmKenya Initiative|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/farmkenya/article/2001293527/increased-human-activities-threaten-source-of-nairobi-river|access-date=2021-07-27|website=Farm Kenya Initiative|language=en}}</ref> With the recent completion of the Southern Bypass that connects Mombasa to Nairobi via Kikuyu, the town is poised for greater growth as it is the only town on the Bypass.

==History==
The town has some British colonial history links, like the Right Reverend Musa Gitau ([[Swahili language|Swahili]] for Moses Gitau), an African believer in democracy who led among the first Christian faithful during colonial times.

An interdenominational missionary conference held in Kikuyu in June 1913 provoked the so-called [[Kikuyu controversy]], which briefly roiled the [[Anglicanism|Anglican churches]] from December 1913 to February 1914
