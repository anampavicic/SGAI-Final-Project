'''North Maluku''' ({{langx|id|Maluku Utara}}) is a [[province of Indonesia]]. It covers the northern part of the [[Maluku Islands]], bordering the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the north, the [[Halmahera Sea]] to the east, the [[Molucca Sea]] to the west, and the [[Seram Sea]] to the south. It shares maritime borders with [[North Sulawesi]], [[Southeast Sulawesi]] and [[Central Sulawesi]] to the west, [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]] to the south, [[Southwest Papua]] to the east, and [[Palau]] and the [[Philippines]] to the north. The provincial capital is [[Sofifi]] on the largest island of [[Halmahera]], while the largest city is the island city of [[Ternate]]. The population of North Maluku was 1,038,087 in the 2010 census,<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> making it one of the least-populous provinces in Indonesia, but by the 2020 Census the population had risen to 1,282,937,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> and the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 1,328,594.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Provinsi Maluku Utara Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.82)</ref>

North Maluku was originally the centre of the four largest Islamic sultanates in the eastern Indonesian archipelago—[[Sultanate of Bacan|Bacan]], [[Sultanate of Jailolo|Jailolo]], [[Sultanate of Tidore|Tidore]] and [[Sultanate of Ternate|Ternate]]—known as the ''Moloku Kië Raha'' (the Four Mountains of Maluku). Upon Europeans' arrival at the beginning of the 16th century, North Maluku became the site of competition between the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] to control trade. In the end, the Dutch emerged victorious, beginning three centuries of Dutch rule in the region. The [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] invaded the region during [[World War II]], and Ternate became the center of the Japanese rule of the Pacific region. Following [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesian independence]], the region became a part of the province of [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]].

The province of North Maluku was officially established on 12 October 1999, by separation from [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]]. The island city of Ternate served as its ''de facto'' capital until 2010, when the provincial government moved to [[Sofifi]] on the mainland of Halmahera. The regional economy in North Maluku largely relies on the agricultural sector, fisheries and other types of marine products. The main commodities that support the economic pulse in North Maluku include [[copra]], [[nutmeg]], [[clove]]s, [[Fishery|fisheries]], [[gold]] and [[nickel]]. North Maluku's agricultural products include [[rice]], [[Maize|corn]], roasted sweet potatoes, [[bean]]s, [[coconut]], potatoes, nutmeg, [[sago]], and [[eucalyptus]].

== Etymology ==
Historically, the term Maluku referred to the four royal centres in North Maluku, namely [[Sultanate of Ternate|Ternate]], [[Tidore Sultanate|Tidore]], [[Bacan Islands|Bacan]] and [[Sultanate of Jailolo|Jailolo]]. A type of confederation consisting of the four kingdoms, which most likely emerged in the 14th century, was called Moloku Kie Raha or "Four Mountains of Maluku".<ref>C.F. van Fraassen 1987 Ternate, de Molukken en de Indonesische Archipel. Leiden: Rijksmuseum te Leiden, Vol. I, p. 18.</ref> Although the four kingdoms subsequently expanded and covered the entire North Maluku region (as now defined) and parts of [[Sulawesi]] and [[New Guinea]], the area of expansion was originally not included in the term Maluku. This only referred to the four main clove-producing islands to the west of [[Halmahera]]: Ternate, Tidore. [[Moti Island|Moti]] and [[Makian]]. Bacan further to the south, and Jailolo on Halmahera, were also commonly included in Maluku Proper, the four kingdoms forming a ritual quadripartition with connotations to local cosmology.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen 1987, Vol. I, p. 18.</ref>

The etymology of the word ''Maluku'' is not very clear, and it has been a matter of debate for many experts.<ref>Leonard Andaya 1993 ''The world of Maluku''. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, p. 47.</ref> The first recorded word that can be identified with ''Maluku'' comes from [[Nagarakretagama]], an [[Old Javanese]] eulogy of 1365. Canto 14 stanza 5 mentioned ''Maloko'', which Pigeaud identified with [[Ternate]] or Moluccas.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pigeaud |first=Theodoor Gautier Thomas |title=Java in the 14th Century: A Study in Cultural History, Volume III: Translations |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |year=1960c |isbn=978-94-011-8772-5 |edition=3rd revised |location=The Hague}}</ref>{{rp|17}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Pigeaud |first=Theodoor Gautier Thomas |title=Java in the 14th Century: A Study in Cultural History, Volume IV: Commentaries and Recapitulations |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |year=1962 |isbn=978-94-017-7133-7 |edition=3rd revised |location=The Hague}}</ref>{{rp|34}} A theory holds that the name Maluku comes from the concept of "Maluku Kie Raha". "Raha" means four, while "kie" here means mountain. referring to 4 mountains of Ternate, Tidore, Bacan, and Jailolo (Halmahera) which have their own kolano (title for local kings). Therefore, the Maluku can come from: "Moloku" here means to grasp or hold. Using these the meaning of "Moloku Kie Raha" is "confederation of four mountain". However the root word "loku" comes from local Malay creole word for a unit, therefore not an indigenous language. The other idea is the word originated from "Maloko" which is a combination of "Ma" which is for support and "Loko" refer to area. The phrase "Maloko Kie Raha" means "the place/world which has four mountains".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Amal|first1=Muhammad A.|title=Kepulauan Rempah-rempah|date=2016|publisher=Gramedia|location=Jakarta|isbn= 978-6024241667}}</ref>

==History==
=== Precolonial era ===
The island of [[Ternate]] or Gapi began to grow in the early 13th century. The early Ternate population was the result of an exodus from [[Halmahera]]. Initially there were four villages in Ternate, each headed by a ''momole'' (head of a clan). they were the first to make contact with merchants who came looking for spices. The population of Ternate became increasingly heterogeneous with settlements of [[Arabs|Arab]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] traders. With the increasingly busy trading activities there was an increase of threats coming from pirates, the Momole Guna Tobona leaders held a conference to form a stronger organization and appoint a single leader as king.<ref>Leonard Andaya 1993, p. 50.</ref>

In 1257, according to traditional chronology, [[Cico of Ternate|Momole Cico]], Sampalu's leader was elected and appointed as the first ''kolano'' (king) with the title Baab Mashur Malamo (1257-1277).<ref>C.F. van Fraassen 1987, Vol. II, p. 1-2.</ref> The Kingdom of Gapi was centered in the village of Ternate, which later grew bigger and more populous, the population was also referred as Gam Lamo or the big village (later Gamalama). Ternate was the largest and most populous settlement on the island, so the people would call the kingdom Ternate rather than Gapi. Under the leadership of several generations of rulers, Ternate developed from a kingdom on a small island, to becoming the largest and most influential country in eastern Indonesia, especially in the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccas]]. It was organized in settlement units called ''soa'' which stood under a headmen or ''bobato''. At the top, the ''kolano'' was assisted by four chief officials, ''dopolo ngaruha'', led by a first minister or ''jogugu''.<ref>Muridan Widjojo 2009 ''The revolt of Prince Nuku: Cross-cultural alliance-making in Maluku, c. 1780-1810''. Leiden: Brill, p. 47-8.</ref>

Starting in the mid-15th century, Islam was adopted by the leading families in the kingdom, due to the influence of Muslim merchants from [[Java]], [[India]] and the [[Malay World]].<ref>C.F. van Fraassen 1987, Vol. I, p. 32.</ref> Some aspects of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] were applied, though Islam was only patchily disseminated until the second half of the 16th century.<ref>Leonard Andaya 1993, p. 147.</ref> Sultan [[Zainal Abidin of Ternate|Zainal Abidin]] substituted the title of ''kolano'' with that of [[Sultan]], following other rulers from the Malay World.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen 1987, Vol. II, p. 4.</ref> With this, Muslim scholars became important figures in the Ternate kingdom.

Opposite to Ternate lies the island of [[Tidore]], the seat of the [[Tidore Sultanate|Kingdom of Tidore, or Duko]]. According to the genealogies of the kings of Ternate and Tidore, the first ''kolano'' of Tidore was Sahjati (Muhammad Naqil) who ascended the throne in 1081.<ref>[http://annienugraha.com/tidore-dalam-balutan-sejarah-kesultanan-tidore/ Annie Nugraha 2017 "Tidore dalam balutan sejarah"]</ref> The ruler was known as ''Kië ma-kolano'', "King of the Mountain". It was only at the end of the 15th century that [[Islam]] was adopted as the official religion of the kingdom. The 9th King of Tidore, Sultan [[Ciri Leliatu|Jamaluddin]], chose to convert to [[Islam]] because of the preaching of Sheikh Mansur from [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]].<ref>P.J.B.C. Robidé van der Aa 1879 ''Reizen naar Nederlandsch Nieuw-Guinea''. 's-Gravenhage: M. Nijhoff, p. 18.[https://archive.org/details/reizennaarneder00crabgoog/page/n66/mode/2up]</ref> Of the other two kingdoms, Jailolo was the most powerful in the Moluccas in the pre-European era until its powers dissipated in the 16th century. Bacan had importance as a link between the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] and the [[Papuan people|Papuans]] in the 16th century, but also shrank to insignificance due to military setbacks and severe population decline in the 16th and early 17th centuries.<ref>Leonard Andaya 1993, p. 130-2.</ref>

=== Colonial era ===
The first European to land in the Moluccas was [[Ludovico di Varthema]], an [[Italians|Italian]] explorer who claims to have visited the region in 1505. In 1512, the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] set foot in Ternate for the first time under the leadership of [[Francisco Serrão]]. With the approval of Sultan [[Bayan Sirrullah]], Portugal was allowed to establish a trading post in Ternate. Portugal came not only to share the trading opportunities, but to control the commerce in [[spice]]s, [[nutmeg]] and [[clove]]s, in Maluku. For this reason, the foreigners first had to subordinate to Ternate. Their superior weaponry and possession of the trading [[entrepôt]] of [[Malacca]] made them attractive as allies. But as soon as they were permanently established, the Europeans began to interfere in local politics. Simultaneously, [[Al-Mansur of Tidore]] received the remnants of the [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]] expedition in 1521 and tried to secure the Spanish as allies, though the presence of Spain in Maluku were very limited up to 1582. Ternate and Tidore lived in a near-permanent state of rivalry during the 16th and 17th centuries, though there was also a ritual dualism in their relationship.<ref>Leonard Andaya 1993, p. 55, 115-6</ref>

Sultan Bayan Sirrullah died in 1521, leaving heirs who were still very young. The Tidorese princess [[Nyaicili Boki Raja|Nukila]], the widow of the sultan, and Prince Taruwese, son of the deceased sultan by a low-ranking wife, acted as guardians. Queen Mother Nukila intended to unite Ternate and Tidore under one crown, headed by one of her two sons, [[Dayal of Ternate|Pangeran Hidayat]] (later Sultan Dayalu) or prince [[Boheyat|Abu Hayat]] (later Sultan Abu Hayat II). Meanwhile, Prince Tarruwese wanted the throne for himself.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen 1987, Vol. I, p. 38.</ref>

The Portuguese took advantage of this opportunity and pitted them against each other, resulting in civil strife. Queen Nukila's side was supported by Tidore while Prince Taruwese was supported by Portugal. After overcoming his adversary, Prince Taruwese was in turn betrayed and killed by the Portuguese.<ref>P.A. Tiele 1879-1887 "De Europëers in den Maleischen Archipel", ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'' 25-36, Part II:1, p. 9-10.</ref> The Portuguese captain acted as an adviser to the kingdom. Through his influence, the royal council was persuaded to appoint prince [[Tabariji of Ternate|Tabariji]] as sultan in 1533. But when the Ternatans began to show hostility to Christianized regions in [[Halmahera]], Tabariji was exiled to the Portuguese colony of [[Goa]], [[India]] in 1535. There he was converted to Christianity and was later pushed to write a testament that bequeathed Ternate to the King of Portugal.<ref>Georg Schurhammer 1980 ''Francis Xavier: His Life, his times - vol. 3: Indonesia and India, 1545-1549''. Rome: The Jesuits Historical Institute, p. 39-40.[https://archive.org/details/fx-schurhammer3/page/n59/mode/2up]</ref> This made the next sultan [[Hairun]] a vassal of Portugal, but he disregarded the testament and built up his power behind the backs of the Portuguese.

Portugal helped Hairun conquer the [[Sultanate of Jailolo|Jailolo kingdom]] in 1551, reducing it to a Ternate vassal.<ref>Leonard Andaya 1993, p. 130.</ref> However, because of the treatment of his brothers and himself caused deep resentment of Sultan Hairun. He tried to weaken the Portuguese positions in Maluku, sending expeditions to attack the partly Christianized [[Ambon Island]]. The actions of the Portuguese also caused anger among the people who backed the Sultan. In response, the Portuguese captain, Diogo Lopes de Mesquita invited Hairun for negotiations but murdered the sultan who entered the fort without his bodyguards.<ref>P.A. Tiele 1877-1887, Part IV:5, p. 442.</ref>

The assassination of Sultan Hairun incited the people of Ternate to expel Portugal. Even other parts of the Moluccas chose to support the leadership and struggle of the new [[Sultan Babullah of Ternate|Sultan Baabullah]]. The fortresses of Portugal throughout Maluku and the eastern regions of Indonesia were attacked. After five years of war, the Portuguese were expelled from northern Maluku in 1575. Under the leadership of Sultan Baabullah, the power of Ternate reached its peak. His area of influence stretched from [[North Sulawesi|North]] and [[Central Sulawesi]] in the west to the [[Raja Ampat|Papuan Islands]] in the east, from the southern [[Philippines]] in the north to the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]] in the south. The [[Bacan Sultanate]], whose ruler, Dom João Hairun, had converted to Christianity, was also forced to apostate and yield. However, the Portuguese held out in Ambon and established a fortress in Tidore in 1578, since the Tidorese Sultan [[Gapi Baguna]] began to fear Baabullah's ambitions.<ref>Leonard Andaya 1993, p. 132-7.</ref>

After the death of Sultan Baabullah, the sultanate began to weaken. The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], who had [[Iberian Union|united]] with Portugal in 1580, tried to regain control of Maluku by attacking Ternate via the Iberian base in Tidore. With Spain strengthening its position in the Philippines, Ternate formed an alliance with local Muslim lords in [[Mindanao]] to drive off the Spanish, but failed. Sultan [[Saidi Berkat]] defeated several invasion attempts, but was eventually captured by the Spaniards in 1606 and exiled to [[Manila]]. The Spanish-allied Tidore took over some Ternatan dependencies.<ref>Leonard Andaya 1993, p. 140-1.</ref>
[[File:Overwinning van de Hollanders op de Portugezen op Tidore, 1605, RP-P-OB-80.814.jpg|400px|thumb|left|The VOC and the Sultan of Ternate attack Tidore in May 1605 and capture the Portuguese fort, an event triggering Spanish retaliation in the following year.]]

Surviving Ternatan aristocrats requested the help from the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], the Dutch responded and helped Sultan [[Mudafar Syah I]] to reestablish himself on Ternate Island. On 26 June 1607 the sultan signed a contract that gave the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) a monopoly in purchasing spices in his realm, in return for Dutch assistance against Spain.<ref>Peter Borschberg 2015 ''Journals, memorials and letters of Cornelis Matelieff de Jonge''. Singapore: NUS Press, p. 87-9.</ref> In 1607, the Dutch also built [[Fort Oranje (Ternate)|Fort Oranje]] on Ternate, which was their first stronghold in the archipelago. The VOC expelled the Spanish from most of Maluku in the following years, though Spain kept Tidore and [[Fort Kastela|Fort Gammalamo]] in Ternate until 1663. The unbalanced relationship between the Netherlands and Ternate caused dissatisfaction with the rulers and nobles of Ternate. Among them were Hidayat, a young Ambonese ''kimelaha'' (governor) who was also a former regent of Ternate and led the opposition against both Mudafar Syah and the Dutch. He ignored the Dutch trade monopoly agreement by selling spices to Javanese and [[Makassar people|Makassar]] traders. The resistance offered by him and his successors, and by the Muslim vassal state Hitu on Ambon, led to a long series of wars up to the 1650s where the VOC subjugated Ambon with Ternate's assistance.<ref>J. Keuning 1988 "Ambonese, Portuguese and Dutchmen: the history of Ambon to the end of the seventeenth century", in M.A.P. Meilink-Roelofsz et al. (eds), ''Dutch authors on Asian history''. Dordrecht: Foris, p. 379-92.</ref>

Meanwhile, the Sultanate of Tidore succeeded in preventing direct Dutch interference in their territory and remained independent until the end of the 18th century. Over the 17th century Tidore built up its positions in south-east Halmahera and [[Papua (province)|Papua]] that yielded foodstuff, forest products and slaves.<ref>Leonard Andaya 1993, p. 169-74.</ref> However, the VOC eventually succeeded in pacifying Ternate and Tidore. In its height, the VOC pursued an orderly, and controlling strategy, helped by a strong and flexible organization. Both Ternate and Tidore agreed to extirpate all clove trees in their realms in the 1650s, ensuring Dutch monopoly on clove cultivation. Because of the colonial policy, Maluku became an economic backwater after the mid-17th century. On the other hand, the rulers were able to strengthen their personal powers with their subjects under European protection. Ternate was reduced to a vassal of the VOC in 1682, and Tidore met the same fate in 1780.<ref>Leonard Andaya 1993, p. 167, 185-6; Muridan Widjojo 2009, p. 56.</ref> The Tidorese prince [[Nuku of Tidore|Nuku]] led a successful anti-Dutch rebellion that encompassed much of Maluku and western Papua in 1780–1805. Helped by the [[French and British interregnum in the Dutch East Indies|British invasion]] in 1796–1803 he was able to push back Dutch positions, but resistance collapsed after his death.<ref>Muridan Widjojo 2009, p. 57-89.</ref> In the end, Ternate and Tidore as well as other kingdoms in Maluku were incorporated in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. For more than a century after 1816, the archipelago remained under strict Dutch control, though the sultanates Ternate, Tidore and Bacan remained as ''zelfbesturende landschappen'' (self-ruling territories) until the [[Indonesian Revolution]].<ref>C.F. van Fraassen 1987, Vol. I, p. 57-62.</ref>
[[File:31st Division landing on Morotai.jpg|thumb|[[United States Army]] [[31st Infantry Division (United States)|31st Infantry Division]] landing in Morotai during the [[Battle of Morotai]]]]

=== Modern era ===
The [[Empire of Japan]] invaded Maluku early in 1942 as part of its [[Dutch East Indies Campaign]] of [[World War II]], ousting the Dutch from the region. Halmahera became the site of a [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] naval base at [[Kao, Indonesia|Kao]] Bay. 2 years later, [[United States Armed Forces|US forces]] and their allies launched the [[Battle of Morotai]] in 1944; bombing the island in August and invading it in September. [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Japanese forces]] on [[Morotai]] held out until 1945 but failed to expel the Allies. In the latter part of 1944, 61,000 personnel landed on Morotai.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=102}} Two thirds of them were engineers, who rapidly established facilities including harbors and two airstrips{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=102}} plus extensive fuel stores. The formal surrender of the Second Japanese Army took place at Morotai on 9 September 1945. The last [[Japanese holdout]] from the war, Private [[Teruo Nakamura]] ([[Amis language|Amis]]: Attun Palalin), was discovered by the [[Indonesian Air Force]] on Morotai, and surrendered to a search patrol on December 18, 1974.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Last Last Soldier?|date=January 13, 1975|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917064,00.html?iid=chix-sphere|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201124208/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917064,00.html?iid=chix-sphere|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 1, 2009|newspaper=Time}}.</ref>

After the Japanese surrendered, the Dutch regained control of the region, before handing it over to the Indonesian government in 1949. In 1957, the [[Permesta]] movement was declared in [[Manado]], [[North Sulawesi]], aiming to overthrow the Indonesian government, The movement received support from the [[United States]] and [[Taiwan]]. In January 1958 the CIA began developing covert support networks to the [[Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia|PRRI]] and Permesta rebels. Supported by the American, Permesta forces captures Morotai and Halmahera as well as several islands. In May 1958 [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]] started to gather amphibious forces to retake both Morotai and the rebel-held town of [[Jailolo (town)|Jailolo]] on the island of Halmahera.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=134}} By May 16 the assault fleet started to gather in [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]] harbour and on May 20 its troops landed on Morotai while élite ''[[Kopasgat|Pasukan Gerak Tjepat]]'' (PGT or "Quick Reaction Force") troops parachuted onto the island.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=147}} Permesta forces surrendered as the island was captured in less than a month.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=147}} It alarmed the Permesta rebels on Jailolo, many of whom fled back to [[North Sulawesi]].{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=147}} Thereafter the rebellion was largely confined to the [[Minahassa Peninsula]] of Sulawesi, where Permesta remnants waged a guerilla campaign until the last unit surrendered in January 1962.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=161}}
[[File:Indonesian Navy Commando Corps on Morotai Beach, Jalesveva Jayamahe, p154.jpg|thumb|Indonesian Navy Commando Corps on Morotai Beach during the Permesta insurgency]]
During the administration of President [[B. J. Habibie]], the idea emerged to accelerate development in several potential regions by forming new provinces. Maluku was one of the potential areas for accelerating development through the parttion of the province, mainly because of the pace of development between the northern and southern regions and or between the middle and southeast regions were uneven. On that basis, the government established North Maluku Province (with the temporary capital in Ternate) which was confirmed by Law Number 46 of 1999 concerning the division of North Maluku Province, [[Buru Regency]] and [[Tanimbar Islands Regency]].<ref>Lembaran Negara Tahun 1999 Nomor 174, Tambahan Lembaran Negera Nomor 3895</ref>

North Maluku was also the site of the [[Maluku sectarian conflict]]. Although the area was more peaceful than the neighbouring [[Maluku (province)|Maluku province]], there were several clashes between Christians and Muslims in Ternate and Halmahera. Several people were killed in [[Kao, Indonesia|Kao]], Halmahera as residents of both faiths and [[Makian]]ese Muslim migrants fought for three days, the violence had started with the invasion of Sosol, one of the two villages destroyed by the Makianese gang.<ref name=north>{{cite journal|last=Duncan|first=Christopher R.|title=The Other Maluku: Chronologies of Conflict in North Maluku|journal=Indonesia|date=October 2005|volume=80|issue=80|series=Southeast Asia Program Publications at Cornell University|pages=53–80|jstor=3351319}}</ref><ref name="braith200">{{harvnb|Braithwaite|Dunn|2010|pp=200–201}}</ref> A team of leaders was tasked with securing peace by the regional government, however no modifications were made to the redistricting decision and tension remained.<ref name="braith200" /> The conflict spread from Halmahera to neighbouring Ternate and Tidore. On 6 November 1999, a several-hundred strong Muslim gang, led by local Makianese political elite and thought to be mostly Makianese refugees, raged through [[Ternate]] attacking the Christian minority there.<ref name=braith202>{{harvnb|Braithwaite|Dunn|2010|pp=202–203}}</ref> The police forces of Ternate were only able to guard their own institutions from attack, yet the traditional guards of the [[Sultan]] of Ternate, mostly composed of local Ternate Muslims, were particularly effective at protecting the local Christian population from attack.<ref name="braith214">{{harvnb|Braithwaite|Dunn|2010|p=214}}</ref> The Sultan's guard had both established secure perimeters around areas of the city, including the mostly [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese-owned]] business district, and physically stood between the mobs and possible victims in some cases and were later commended for preventing a potential massacre. At least 4 people died, however, and the Indonesian Navy later evacuated the several thousand Christian residents of both islands to [[Bitung]] and [[Manado]] in [[North Sulawesi]]. 

The conflict was resolved after the [[Malino II Accord]] was signed by both parties.

==Geography==
The islands of North Maluku are mostly of volcanic origin, with the volcanoes of [[Dukono]] on Halmahera and [[Gamalama]] on Ternate still active and the whole of Tidore consisting of a large [[stratovolcano]]. 

The largest of the 1,474 islands are [[Halmahera]] (with an area of 18,039.6 km<sup>2</sup>, or 56.4% of the land area of the province), [[Taliabu]] (2,913.2 km<sup>2</sup>), [[Obi (island)|Obi]] (2,542.3 km<sup>2</sup>), [[Morotai]] (2,266.4 km<sup>2</sup>), [[Bacan]] (1,899.8 km<sup>2</sup>), [[Mangole]] (1,228.5 km<sup>2</sup>), [[Sula Islands Regency|Sulabesi]] (557.8 km<sup>2</sup>), [[Kasiruta]] (472.67 km<sup>2</sup>) and [[Mandioli]] (229.8 km<sup>2</sup>). 

The North Maluku Islands are formed by the movement of three tectonic plates, namely [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasia]], the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]] and [[Indo-Australian Plate|Indo-Australia]] which have occurred over geological ages. This movement formed the volcanic archipelago that stretched from north to south off western Halmahera, including [[Mount Hiri|Hiri Island]], [[Ternate]] Island, [[Tidore]] Island, [[Mare Island (Indonesia)|Mare Island]], [[Moti Island]] and [[Makian Island]]. Each of these islands constitutes a stratovolcano. Further south lie the Kayoa and Bacan Islands (there are also two stratovolcanoes on Bacan Island). Halmahera Island itself is a volcanic island even though volcanic activity occurs only in a part of its territory.

The islands have a [[tropical rainforest climate|tropical rainforest climate (Af)]].

==Ecology==
{{main|Halmahera rain forests}}
The [[rainforest]]s of [[Halmahera]], [[Morotai]], the [[Obi Islands]], the [[Bacan]] islands and other islands of North Maluku have been described by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] as the [[Halmahera rain forests]] [[ecoregion]] and are home to a number of plant and animal species unique to the islands, which are in the [[Wallacea]] transition zone, containing a mixture of species of Asian and [[Australasian realm|Australasian]] origin. The predominant trees of the forest are ''[[Anisoptera thurifera]]'', ''[[Hopea gregaria]]'', ''[[Hopea iriana]]'', ''[[Shorea assamica]]'', ''[[Shorea montigena]]'', ''[[Shorea selanica]]'', and ''[[Vatica rassak]]''.

The endemic mammals found here include the [[Obi mosaic-tailed rat]] (''Melomys obiensis''), [[masked flying fox]] (''Pteropus personatus''), and four arboreal [[marsupial]]s, the [[ornate cuscus|ornate]] (''Phalanger ornatus''), [[Rothschild's cuscus|Rothschild's]] (''P. rothschildi''), [[blue-eyed cuscus|blue-eyed]] (''P. matabiru'') and [[Gebe cuscus|Gebe]] (''P. alexandrae'') [[cuscus]]es. There are over two hundred different birds on the islands, twenty-six of which are endemic, a large number for this small island group. The endemics include four birds which are the only species in their [[genera]], including the elusive [[invisible rail]] (''Habroptila wallacii''), the [[white-streaked friarbird]] (''Melitograis gilolensis''), and two birds of paradise, the [[paradise-crow]] (''Lycocorax pyrrhopterus'') and [[Wallace's standardwing]] (''Semioptera wallacii''). The islands are also home to the largest bee in the world, [[Wallace's giant bee]] (''Megachile pluto'').<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|name=Halmahera Rain Forests|id=aa0106}}</ref>

Most of the natural forest remains on these mountainous islands, although much of the coastal and lowland areas have been cleared for clove-planting since the sixteenth century, especially on the islands of Ternate and [[Tidore]]. Logging has occurred more recently on Halmahera and Morotai.

The [[Sula Islands]] are part of the [[Sulawesi lowland rain forests]] ecoregion.<ref>Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002). ''Terrestrial Ecoregions of the Indo-Pacific: a Conservation Assessment.'' Washington, DC: Island Press.</ref>

==Government and administrative divisions==
In 1999, the northern part of Maluku, then comprising the North Maluku (''Maluku Utara'') Regency, the [[Central Halmahera Regency|Central Halmahera]] (''Halmahera Tengah'') Regency and the City of [[Ternate]], were split off to form a separate province of North Maluku (Maluku Utara). The existing North Maluku Regency was on 25 February 2003 (by law Udang-Udang Nomor 1 Tahun 2003) split into four new regencies - [[North Halmahera]], [[West Halmahera]], [[South Halmahera Regency|South Halmahera]] and the [[Sula Islands]] - while on the same date two new entities were created from parts of the Central Halmahera Regency - [[East Halmahera Regency]] and the new city of [[Tidore|Tidore Islands]]. A seventh regency, covering '''Morotai Island''', was formed on 29 October 2008 from part of North Halmahera and an eighth regency, covering '''Taliabu Island''', was formed on 14 December 2012 from the westernmost island in the Sula Islands Regency. All are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 2020<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> Censuses, and according to the official estimates for mid 2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Provinsi Maluku Utara Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.82)</ref> The table also includes the number of administrative districts (''kecamatan'') in each city or regency, the number of administrative villages (rural ''desa'' and urban ''kelurahan'') into which those districts are subdivided, and the numbers of named islands.

Notes: (a) The Regency-level BPS publication for mid 2023 shows a population figure of 96,977 for Central Halmahera which is wildly different from the Provincial-level publication figures given above. Note several of the figures for areas also show great disparity between the BPS figires published by the Province and those published by the Regencies, although both sets are "official".

The province now forms one of Indonesia's 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the [[Indonesian Parliament|People's Representative Council]]. The '''North Maluku Electoral District''' consists of all of the 8 regencies and 2 cities in the province, and elects 3 members to the People's Representative Council.<ref>Law No. 7/2017 (''UU No. 7 Tahun 2017'') as amended by Government Regulation in Lieu of Law No. 1/2022 and Regulation of General Elections Commission No. 6/2023.</ref>
