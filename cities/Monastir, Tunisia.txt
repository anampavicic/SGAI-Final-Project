'''Monastir''', also called '''Mestir''' ({{langx|ar|المنستير}} ''{{audio|help=no|Monastir2.wav|Monastīr / Mestīr}}'', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|{{linktext|μοναστήριον}}}} "hermit's cell, [[monastery]]"), is a city on the central coast of [[Tunisia]], in the [[Sahel, Tunisia|Sahel]] area, some {{convert|20|km|abbr=off}} south of [[Sousse]] and {{convert|162|km|abbr=off}} south of [[Tunis]]. Traditionally a fishing port, Monastir is now a major tourist resort. Its population is about 93,306.  It is the capital of [[Monastir Governorate]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===

Monastir is a [[peninsula]] surrounded by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] on three sides and forming, to the south, the Gulf of Monastir of the same name, which extends to Cap of [[Ras Dimass]]. It offers diverse landscapes, in particular its sandy and rocky beaches as well as a [[cliff]] stretching over nearly six kilometers.

==History==
[[File:MonastirRibat.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ribat of Monastir|The Ribat in Monastir]]]]

Monastir was founded on the ruins of the [[Punic]]–[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city of [[Ruspina]]. The city features a well-preserved [[Ribat of Monastir]] that was used to scan the sea for hostile ships and as a defence against the attacks of the Byzantine fleet. Several [[ulema]] came to stay in the ''ribat'' of this peaceful city for contemplation. The ribat was, in the 1970s, also one of the filming locations for both the [[miniseries]] ''[[Jesus of Nazareth (miniseries)|Jesus of Nazareth]]'' and [[Monty Python]]'s ''[[Life of Brian]]''. There are panoramic views of the city taken from a French naval intelligence airship in 1924.

==Transportation==
The city is on the electrified, metre-gauge [[Sahel Metro]] line with trains serving [[Sousse]] and [[Mahdia]] which the city is served by 5 stations of the metro : ''Hôtels Monastir'', ''Aéroport Skanès-Monastir'', ''Faculté Monastir'', ''Monastir'', ''Monastir-Zone indistruelle''. [[Monastir – Habib Bourguiba International Airport]] has flights from most Western European countries. It is run by [[Tepe Akfen Ventures]] Airport Holding (TAV).

Monastir has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSh'') with hot summers, pleasant winters, much sunshine and low rainfall year-round. The city sits in the northeast of Tunisia, on its central coast. It is milder than inland areas of Tunisia, forty percent of which is part of the Sahara. In the summer, while humidity is low, the soaring heat can still be hard to handle. The average high temperature of {{convert|29|°C|1}} in June skips past the {{convert|30|°C}} mark in the middle of the month and rises to {{convert|33|°C|1}} in July and August.
