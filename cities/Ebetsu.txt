{{Nihongo|'''Ebetsu'''|江別市|Ebetsu-shi}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] in [[Ishikari Subprefecture]], [[Hokkaido]], Japan.

== History ==
Ebetsu was settled originally by Japanese people in 1871, who came from the [[Miyagi Prefecture]] on [[Honshu]]. In 1878, [[tondenhei]] began moving into the area. When the [[Meiji Government]], in 1878, designated Hokkaido as part of Japan, settlers began to flood the area. Ebetsu earned township status in 1916 and city status in 1954. During the 1960s and 1970s, a burgeoning population in [[Sapporo]] caused the population in Ebetsu to concurrently boom. In 1991, the city reached 100,000 people.

The name Ebetsu is derived from the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] name of the Chitose River which flows into the Ishikari River in the city. According to John Batchelor in his "An Ainu-English Dictionary" (chapter 1, section V: Place Names Considered) the [[Ainu language]] name was E-pet or "[[Humorism|humour]] river" based on its murky colour. {{Citation needed|reason=Source needed to support this alleged Ainu spelling and translation|date=March 2021}}

== Demographics ==
As of July 31, 2023, the city had an estimated [[population]] of 118,764, with 56,325 [[household]]s,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.city.ebetsu.hokkaido.jp|title= Official website of Ebetsu City|publisher= Ebetsu City|location= Japan|language= ja|access-date= 16 May 2017}}</ref> and a [[population density]] of 634 persons per km². The total area is 187.38&nbsp;km².

== Geography and transportation ==
The majority of commercial Ebetsu is on or immediately surrounding Route 12 (runs north-south through town).  The northern limits of town are delineated by the [[Ishikari River]], the southern sub-city of Oasa by Ebetsu's boundary with Sapporo. It bounds the city limits of Kitahiroshima, Iwamizawa, Nanporo, Tōbetsu, and Shinshinotsu.

Ebetsu is about 16&nbsp;km from downtown [[Sapporo]]. It is accessed by the Hokkaido Expressway, by Chūō or JR Hokkaidō bus lines, or by the Asahikawa-Hakodate train line that approximately follows Route 12 through town (at Oasa, Nopporo, Takasago, and Ebetsu stations), joining with the northwest-southeast running main line that extends from [[Chitose Airport]] to [[Sapporo Station]] in Shinsapporo (New Sapporo, a district of larger metropolitan Sapporo).

The extensive Nopporo Forest State Park (the world's largest park of virgin forest on level ground) is behind Ebetsu's [[Rakuno Gakuen University|Rakunō Gakuen University]] (the first university in Ebetsu, founded in 1949), encompassing 2015 hectares of preserved forest. Because of Ebetsu's location approximately in the middle of the [[Ishikari Subprefecture|Ishikari]] Plain (Sapporo city is the southwestern extent), it is known for having wind year-round.

== Climate ==
The 10-year average temperature for Ebetsu is 7.1 degrees Celsius.  The hottest and coldest temperatures, respectively, ever recorded are {{convert|34.7|C|F|1}} and {{convert|-27.7|C|F|1}}.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.city.ebetsu.hokkaido.jp/aboutebetsu/gaiyou/gaiyou.html |title=江別市の概要 気象 江別市 |access-date=2013-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630000306/http://www.city.ebetsu.hokkaido.jp/aboutebetsu/gaiyou/gaiyou.html |archive-date=2013-06-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Mascot ==
[[File:Ebechun.png|thumb|left|200px|Ebechun, the city's mascot]]
Ebetsu's mascot is {{Nihongo|'''Ebechun'''|えべチュン}}. He is a yellow flightless bird that resembled a young rooster who loves to be petted. His head is unusually square. Because of this, he is nicknamed {{Nihongo|''Renga tori''|レンガ鳥}}. He may looked sad because of his tears (which is his charm point), he is actually happy. Whenever something wonderful happens (e.g. farmers working hard, witnessing children, falling leaves, etc.), he will shed tears for joy. He is known for carrying a grain ear. He likes locally grown wheat. When he was first revealed back in 2011, he was genderless. He is originally an unofficial mascot until it is chosen by the local tourism association to represent the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hokkaidofan.com/ebechun/|title=江別市のえべチュン|website=Hokkaido Fan Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yurugp.jp/jp/vote/detail.php?id=00000173|title=えべチュン (北海道)|website=Yuru-Chara Grand Prix}}</ref>
