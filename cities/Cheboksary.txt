'''Cheboksary'''{{efn|{{IPAc-en|ˌ|tʃ|ɛ|b|ɒ|k|ˈ|s|ɛər|i|}}; {{langx|ru|Чебоксары}} {{IPA|ru|tɕɪbɐkˈsarɨ|}}; {{langx|cv|Шупашкар|Şupaşkar}}}} is the [[capital city]] of [[Chuvashia]], [[Russia]]. It is a port on the [[Volga River]].

==Geography==
The city is located in the [[Volga Upland]] region and stands on the shore of the [[Cheboksary Reservoir]]. Its area is {{convert|250.9|km2|sp=us}}.<ref name="Area">Resolution #2083</ref> The [[satellite city]] of [[Novocheboksarsk]] is located about {{convert|6|km|mi|frac=2|sp=us}} east of Cheboksary.

==History==
Cheboksary was first mentioned in written sources in 1469,<ref name="gr">{{cite book|title=Энциклопедия Города России|year=2003|publisher=Большая Российская Энциклопедия|location=Moscow|isbn=5-7107-7399-9|pages=510–512}}</ref> but according to archaeological excavations, the area had been populated much earlier. The site hosted a Bulgarian city of '''Veda Suvar''', which appeared after Mongols [[Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria|defeated major Volga Bulgarian]] cities in the 13th century. During Khanate period the town is believed by some{{Who|date=May 2010}} to have had a [[Turkic language|Turkic]] (probably, [[Tatar language|Tatar]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}) name '''Çabaqsar''' and that the current Russian and English names originate from it. However, in maps by European travelers it was marked as '''Cibocar''' (Pizzigano, 1367), '''Veda-Suar''' ([[Fra Mauro]], 1459). '''Shupashkar''', the Chuvash name literally means the "fortress of the Chuvash".

In 1555, the Russians built a fortress and established a settlement here. In 1625, there were 458 soldiers quartered in Cheboksary, and in 1646 there were 661 males living in the settlement. At the end of the 17th century, Cheboksary was regarded as a major commercial city of the Volga region, and in 1781 it was granted town status<ref name="gr" /> within [[Kazan Governorate]]. In the beginning of the 19th century the population was about 5500, the town had a sawmill and several small manufactures.

In the 16th and the first half of the 17th century the Vvedensky cathedral, four monasteries and eight churches had been built, in the 18th century the stone buildings of treasury and archive, magistracy, court, and ten churches. In 1880, here were counted 783 houses (33 of them from stone), 91 stores, three schools, two hospitals, and one bank.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

In the beginning of the 20th century, 5,100 people lived in Cheboksary. In 1965, the population grew to 163,000.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Cheboksary is the [[capital city|capital]] of the republic.<ref name="Ref37">Law #28</ref> Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is, together with two [[urban-type settlement]]s ([[Novye Lapsary]] and [[Sosnovka, Cheboksary, Chuvash Republic|Sosnovka]]) and two [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|rural localities]], incorporated as the '''[[city of federal subject significance|city of republic significance]] of Cheboksary'''—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of the Chuvash Republic|districts]].<ref name="Ref37" /> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the city of republic significance of Cheboksary is incorporated as '''Cheboksary Urban Okrug'''.<ref name="Ref39">Law #37</ref>

===City divisions===
For administrative purposes, Cheboksary is divided into three city districts: [[Kalininskiy City District, Cheboksary|Kalininskiy]], [[Leninsky City District, Cheboksary|Leninskiy]], and [[Moskovskiy City District, Cheboksary|Moskovskiy]].

Cheboksary possesses many cultural opportunities. These include the [[Public Order (Badge of Honor) Russian Drama Theater]], a philharmonic [[orchestra]], the [[Chuvash State Puppet Theater]] and numerous theaters (showing productions in both [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] languages). However, a very popular gathering place for the locals is the recently{{When|date=September 2021}} completed ''zaliv'' ([[bay]]), situated in the middle of the city. Cheboksary also has boardwalks and beaches along the [[Volga River]], where people swim in the summer. There are also a number of heated pools, health clubs, and [[museum]]s (including the [[Chuvash National Museum]] and Russia's only [[beer]] museum).<ref name="USPC" />

===Sport===
Cheboksary regularly hosts [[Sport of athletics|athletics]] meetings and [[racewalking]] events, including the [[2008 IAAF World Race Walking Cup]], the [[2015 European Team Championships Super League]], and the 2016 Russian athletics and [[masters athletics]] championships.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://apnews.com/3f1006e47dec4458a448029cbb5b1464/despair-and-defiance-russian-athletes-react-doping-ban|title=Despair and defiance as Russian athletes react to doping ban |first1=Francesca |last1=Ebel |first2=Veronika |last2=Silchenko |date=19 June 2016|publisher=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref> The [[2016 IAAF World Race Walking Team Championships]] were moved from Cheboksary to Rome as part of IAAF sanctions against [[doping in Russia]].

*[[Cheboksary Physics and Mathematics School]]
*[[Cheboksary Cooperative Institute]]

==Economy==
Cheboksary is located near the [[Cheboksary Dam]] generating up to 1,404&nbsp;MW, with a reservoir of {{convert|2274|km2|sp=us}}. Cheboksary is the location of the headquarters of the [[Concern Tractor Plants]], Russia's leading machine building company and one of the largest heavy mechanical engineering companies in the world.<ref name="USPC" /><ref name="ctp">{{cite web|url=http://www.tplants.com/en/company/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523084517/http://www.tplants.com/en/company|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 23, 2009|title=Company Profile|publisher=Concern Tractor Plants|access-date=2009-07-14}}</ref>

==Transportation==

=== Local public transportation ===
[[File:Cheboksary city tram Volga style.jpg|thumb|Cheboksary trolleybus, the blue stripe at the bottom symbolizes the Volga River]]
An extensive system of [[trolleybus]]es, [[autobus]]es, and [[Marshrutka|minibuses]] covers the city, providing quick, convenient access to all parts of the city. For those who prefer [[taxicab|taxi]]s, there are several taxi agencies available, but the favorite means of transportation among locals are so-called "Gypsy" cabs. In Russia, anybody who owns a car is potentially a taxi. This can be a convenient way to get around but it is also potentially dangerous. Official taxis cost less than 6 dollars for travel between most points within the city.<ref name="USPC">{{cite web|title=Economic Overview of the Republic of Chuvashia|publisher=United States Peace Corps Business Development Volunteers in Chuvashia|author=Steven Brown and Olin Lagon|url=http://www.bisnis.doc.gov/bisnis/bisdoc/0106Chuvashia.htm|date=June 2001|access-date=2009-01-10|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050704084704/http://www.bisnis.doc.gov/bisnis/bisdoc/0106Chuvashia.htm|archive-date=July 4, 2005|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

=== River ===
[[File:Cheboksary River tram.jpg|thumb|Intercity hydrofoil river tram in Chuvash colors]]
Because the [[Volga River]] runs through Chuvashia, Cheboksary is a frequent stop on the many [[boat]] tours that travel along the major cities up and down the Volga.
To the south, [[Volgograd]], [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Astrakhan]], the [[Caspian Sea]], and [[Black Sea]] are directly reachable. To the west, the Volga River connects Cheboksary with [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Yaroslavl]], [[Moscow]], and the northern regions of Russia. By using river-sea vessels, it is possible to take cargo from Chuvash riverports all the way to [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Novorossiysk]] (on the Black Sea), [[Astrakhan]], and ports situated on the [[Danube]] river. However, the river is frozen from December to April.<ref name="USPC" />

=== Air ===
The [[Cheboksary Airport]] ([[IATA airport code|IATA]] CSY, [[ICAO airport code|ICAO]] UWKS, international airport since 1995) receives both cargo and passenger aircraft of practically all types and sizes. There are regularly scheduled flights to [[Moscow]] and other destinations. [[Chuvashia Airlines]] was based at this airport until operations ceased in 2009.
Cheboksary is located about a four-hour drive from [[Strigino International Airport]] near [[Nizhny Novgorod]], which offers more flight connections.

==Climate==
The [[climate]] in the region is [[Humid continental climate|continental]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: Dfb), and it is similar to the [[climate of Moscow|climate in Moscow]], although colder in winter, which lasts from late November until late March with a permanent snow cover.
