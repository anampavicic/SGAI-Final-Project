Meerut rose to prominence in 1803 during the [[British Raj|British colonial era]], where it was the site of one of colonial India's largest [[Cantonment|cantonments]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sharma |first=Manoj |date=2023-05-08 |title=Meerut on cusp of great socio-economic change |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/meerut-on-cusp-of-great-socio-economic-change-101683485877879.html |access-date=2024-07-20 |website=Hindustan Times}}</ref> The city is famous for being the starting point of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|1857 rebellion]] against [[Company rule in India]]. Known as the "Sports City of India", Meerut is one of the largest producers of sports goods in the country. The city is also known as the largest producer of musical instruments in the country, as well as one of [[Asia|Asia's]] biggest gold markets. The city is also an education hub in western Uttar Pradesh. It has the 3rd-highest per capita income in the state after [[Ghaziabad district|Ghaziabad]]{{Efn|Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation is divided into five zones: City Zone, Kavi Nagar Zone, Vijay Nagar Zone, Mohan Nagar Zone, and Vasundhara Zone}}and [[Gautam Buddha Nagar district|Gautam Budh Nagar]] ([[Noida]] and [[Greater Noida]]).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Home Page |url=https://meerutgdp.com/ |access-date=2023-09-26 |website=meerutgdp.com}}</ref>

Meerut has been proposed as the capital of a future state of [[Harit Pradesh]], comprising the western region of Uttar Pradesh, a new separate state. India's first Regional Rapid Transit System [[Delhi–Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System|Delhi Meerut RRTS]] is currently being constructed in Meerut. It will be an inter-city high-speed metro corridor.<ref>{{Cite web |title=1st phase of Delhi-Meerut RRTS to open in March – The Financial Express|publisher=NCRTC |url=https://ncrtc.in/1st-phase-of-delhi-meerut-rrts-to-open-in-march-the-financial-express/ |access-date=2023-09-26 |language=en-US}}</ref> It is also known as the expressway capital of Western Uttar Pradesh, having three different expressways.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ganga Expressway|publisher=Uttar Pradesh Expressways Industrial Development Authority|url=https://upeida.up.gov.in/en/page/ganga-expressway |access-date=2023-09-26 |website=upeida.up.gov.in}}</ref>

==Origin of the name==
The city may have derived its name from 'Mayarashtra' ([[Sanskrit]]: मयराष्ट्र), the capital of the kingdom of [[Mayasura]], Mandodari's father and [[Ravana]]'s father-in-law. This name may have mutated to Mairashtra, Mai-dant-ka-khera, Mairaath and eventually Meerut.<ref name="Homepage">{{cite web|url=http://meerut.nic.in/|title=Homepage|publisher=District Meerut|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915130519/http://meerut.nic.in/ |archive-date=15 September 2008 }}</ref><ref name=dg>{{Cite book|title=Uttar Pradesh State Gazetteer: Social services, culture, places of interest|volume=5|author=Uma Varma|publisher=[[Government of Uttar Pradesh]], Department of District Gazetteers|page=359}}</ref>

According to another version, Maya(sura), being a distinguished architect, received from King [[Yudhishthira]] the land on which the city of Meerut now stands and he called this place Maharashtra, a name which over time became shortened to Meerut. Tradition also has it that the city formed a part of the dominions of Mahipala, the king of [[Indraprastha]], and the word Meerut is associated with his name.<ref name="pundir">{{cite book|title=Banking, Bureaucracy, and Social Networks: Scheduled Castes in the Process of Development|author=Jagdish Kumar Pundir|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=svyVzV0n8DQC|publisher=Sarup & Sons|year=1998|isbn=9788176250245|pages=49–50}}</ref>

==History==
===Ancient era===
In [[Ramayana]], It was known as 'Maydant Ka Kheda', the capital of May Danav. It was hometown of [[Mandodari]], wife of Ravana.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bhaskar.com/news/UP-MEER-mandodari-meet-ravan-in-baleshwar-nath-temple-in-meerut-5141034-PHO.html|title=इस मंदिर में मंदोदरी करती थीं शिव पूजा, यहीं पर रावण से हुई थी मुलाकात|trans-title=Mandodari used to worship Shiva in this temple, it was here that she met Ravana|date=21 October 2015|website=Dainik Bhaskar|language=hi|access-date=3 January 2020}}</ref>

After the archaeological excavations at Vidura-ka-tila, a collection of several mounds named after [[Vidura]], in 1950–52, a site {{convert|23|mi|km|abbr=in|order=flip}} north-east of Meerut, it was concluded to be remains of the ancient city of [[Hastinapur]], the capital of [[Kauravas]] and [[Pandavas]] of ''[[Mahabharata]]'', which was washed away by [[Ganges]] floods.<ref name="off">{{cite web |title=Tourist places – Meerut |url=http://meerut.nic.in/tourist.htm |archive-date=19 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619074812/http://meerut.nic.in/tourist.htm}}</ref><ref name="imp254" /><ref name="mdat" />

Meerut also contained a Harappan settlement known as [[Alamgirpur]]. It was also the easternmost settlement of the [[Indus Valley civilisation]].

===Muslim conquests===
In the eleventh century AD, the region to the south-west of the city was ruled by Har Dat, the ''Dor Raja'' of [[Bulandshahr]] who built a fort, which was long known for its strength and finds mention in ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]''.<ref name="imp264">{{cite news|newspaper=The Imperial Gazetteer|date=1909|title=District Meerut|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V17_270.gif|page=264|volume=17|publisher=Digital South Asia Library}}</ref> He was later defeated by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] in 1018, surrendering along with his forces to Mahmud.<ref>{{cite book|title=Indian Islam: a religious history of Islam in India|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.280326|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1930|author=Murray Thurston Titus|page=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.280326/page/n38 21]}}</ref> The prominent local landmark known as the Jama Masjid, dates from this period and is said to have been built by Mahmud's vizir.

[[Timur]] in 1399 attacked and sacked Meerut. It was held by Ilyas Afghan and his son Maula Muhammad Thaneswari who was assisted by non-Muslims led by Safi. Timur tried to negotiate a surrender, to which the inhabitants of the fort replied by stating that [[Tarmashirin]] had tried to capture it in the past but failed. Incensed, he set forth with 10,000 cavalry. The forces scaled the walls and Safi was killed in the battle. The inhabitants were killed and their wives and children enslaved. The fortifications and houses were razed to the ground with prisoners ordered to be flayed alive.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJ4IAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA321|title=Statistical, descriptive and historical account of the North-western Provinces of India|editor=E.T.

===Colonial era===
In 1803, with the fall of Delhi, Daulat Rao Scindia of the Marathas ceded the territory to the British [[East India Company]] (EIC). The cantonment of Meerut was set up in 1806 with particular key interests including its closeness to Delhi and its area inside the rich [[Ganga]] – Yamuna doab. The city was made headquarters of the [[Meerut district|eponymous district]] in 1818.<ref name="imp255">{{cite news|newspaper=The Imperial Gazetteer|title=History|date=1909|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V17_261.gif |page=255|volume=17|publisher=Digital South Asia Library}}</ref><ref name="kinship">{{cite book|title=Kinship and Urbanization: White Collar Migrants in North India|author=Sylvia Vatuk|publisher=University of California Press|year=1972|url=https://archive.org/details/kinshipurbanizat0000vatu|url-access=registration|isbn=9780520020641|pages=[https://archive.org/details/kinshipurbanizat0000vatu/page/2 2]–3|access-date=22 September 2016}}</ref><ref name="imp256">{{cite news|newspaper=The Imperial Gazetteer|date=1909|title=Population|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V17_262.gif|page=256|volume=17|publisher=Digital South Asia Library}}</ref>

Meerut is famously associated with the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|1857 rebellion]] against [[Company rule in India]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Mutiny.html|title=Postcolonial Studies|publisher=Emory University|access-date=27 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114213449/http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Mutiny.html|archive-date=14 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The famous slogan "''Dilli Chalo''" ("Let's march to Delhi!") was first spoken in the city, and the Meerut [[cantonment]] was the place where the rebellion started.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The revolt, which catapulted Meerut into international prominence, started in March 1857 at Barrackpore, Bengal. Indian sepoy [[Mangal Pandey]] shot at two of his commanding officers, missed, made an unsuccessful attempt to commit [[suicide]], and was executed. By April, the fire of Pandey's Uprising scorched north India and reached Meerut, the second-largest East India Company garrison. Here, Europeans and native sepoys were evenly balanced, with a little more than 2,000 on each side. The European cantonment was separated from the Indian one. Close by were Sadar Bazar and Lal Kurti Bazar, the latter named after the red uniforms worn by the [[Presidency armies]]. On 24 April 1857, Meerut's commander, Colonel Carmichael Smyth, paraded 90 Indian sepoys of the Bengal Cavalry, most of whom had come from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. He ordered them to fire the new Enfield cartridges- 85 refused. The cartridges were covered with paper that had to be torn off; Muslim soldiers believed the paper was greased with pig fat and Hindus, with cow fat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.economictimes.indiatimes.com/folk-theorem/hashimpura-and-the-echoes-of-1857-meerut-is-common-to-both/|title=Hashimpura and the echoes of 1857: Meerut is common to both|work=[[The Times of India]] Blogs|access-date=27 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726014434/http://blogs.economictimes.indiatimes.com/folk-theorem/hashimpura-and-the-echoes-of-1857-meerut-is-common-to-both/|archive-date=26 July 2015|url-status=live|date=5 April 2015}}</ref>

All 85 soldiers were stripped of their uniforms, [[court-martial]]ed; they were all sentenced to a decade in prison. The prisoners, who were [[Upper class|upper-class]] members of a [[Cavalry|cavalry regiment]], were shocked at the harsh sentences handed down to them. On 10 May 1857, [[Dhan Singh Gurjar|Kotwal Dhan Singh Gurjar]] opened the gates of the prison. These soldiers, along with the other imprisoned soldiers, escaped prison and declared themselves free, mutinied, attacked, and killed several [[Company rule in India|Company officials]] in the city to bring it under their control. This marked the beginning of a widespread revolt across northern India as these soldiers marched towards Delhi. 10 May is still celebrated as a local holiday in Meerut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meerutdistrict.com/history.htm|title=History of Meerut district|publisher=www.meerutdistrict.com/|access-date=27 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214225000/http://meerutdistrict.com/history.htm|archive-date=14 February 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Meerut was also the venue of the [[Meerut Conspiracy Case]] in March 1929, in which several [[trade union]]ists, including three [[English people|Englishmen]], were arrested by the colonial authorities for organising a railway [[strike action]]. The case quickly became the subject of attention in England, inspiring a 1932 play titled ''Meerut Prisoners'' by left-wing [[Manchester]] street theatre group the ''Red Megaphones'', which highlighted the detrimental effects of [[capitalism]] and [[industrialisation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wcml.org.uk/contents/activists/ewan-maccoll/theatre/the-red-megaphones/|title=Ewan MacColl: The Red Megaphones|publisher=[[Working Class Movement Library]] |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613154110/http://www.wcml.org.uk/contents/activists/ewan-maccoll/theatre/the-red-megaphones/ |archive-date=13 June 2011 }}</ref> Electricity was first introduced to Meerut in 1931.<ref name="kinship"/> In the 1940s, during the height of the [[Indian independence movement]], cinema-goers in Meerut had an unofficial policy of refusing to stand up when ''[[God Save the Queen]]'' played before the film was shown.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} The last session of the [[Indian National Congress]] (INC) before the [[Indian Independence Act 1947|independence of India]] in 1947 was held at Victoria Park in Meerut on 26 November 1946.

== Demand for High Court Bench in Meerut ==
Almost 54% of all cases reaching the High Court originate from the 22 districts of Western UP. Still, western Uttar Pradesh does not have a High Court. People have to travel 700 km away to Allahabad for hearings. Six high courts (Shimla, Delhi, Jaipur, Chandigarh, Nainital, Jammu) from other states are closer than Allahabad from western Uttar Pradesh.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2023-09-03 |title=Lawyers rally for Meerut HC bench, suspend all work on Saturdays |work=The Times of India |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/lawyers-rally-for-meerut-hc-bench-suspend-all-work-on-saturdays/articleshow/103318823.cms?from=mdr |access-date=2023-09-27 |issn=0971-8257}}</ref>

[[File:EqajJS VEAAuOzX.jpg|thumb]]
Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor or Eastern DFC is an [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge]] [[Dedicated freight corridors in India|freight corridor in India]]. The railway will run between [[Ludhiana]] in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[Dankuni]] (near [[Kolkata]]) in [[West Bengal]] via Meerut and [[Khurja]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]].

Apart from this [[Delhi–Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System|Delhi Meerut RRTS]] (RapidX) will also be used for inter-city cargo movement. Vinay Kumar Singh, managing director of NCRTC said, “During non-peak hours, the ridership would be low, so we can use the time to move cargo, including perishable goods.”<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rana |first=Karvi |date=2023-05-31 |title=Delhi Meerut RRTS Train to move cargo at 180kmph |url=https://www.logisticsinsider.in/delhi-meerut-rrts-train-to-move-cargo-at-180kmph/ |access-date=2023-09-27 |website=Logistics Insider |language=en-US}}</ref>

[[File:Namo Bharat Train.jpg|thumb|[[Meerut Metro]] Trainset]]
The NCR Transport Plan 2021 proposed a rail-based mass transit system, called the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) between Delhi to Meerut, with the [[Shahdara district|Shahdara]]-[[Ghaziabad]] section scheduled for construction during 2001-11, and the Ghaziabad-Meerut section scheduled for 2011–21.<ref name="ncr21">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncrpb.nic.in/pdf_files/10modified_ch06transport.pdf|title=NCR Transport Plan 2021|pages=6–7, 11|access-date=24 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321191743/http://www.ncrpb.nic.in/pdf_files/10modified_ch06transport.pdf|archive-date=21 March 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

In September 2010, the RRTS was reported to be proposed between [[Anand Vihar]] and Meerut with the project in its initial stages.

===Air===
The nearest airport is [[Hindon Airport]] at Ghaziabad, located {{cvt|64|km}} away, while the major airport, [[Indira Gandhi International Airport]] at Delhi is about {{cvt|100|km}} away.

The [[Meerut Airport|Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar Airport]] is located at [[Partapur, Uttar Pradesh|Partapur]].

The city has long demanded an airport. However, the government has stalled the project multiple times due to land acquisition reasons and project costs. Even Ajit Singh, the minister of civil aviation announced the project but still, the project was not completed.

BJP MP [[Rajendra Agrawal|Rajendra Agarwal]] met Civil Aviation Minister [[Jyotiraditya Scindia]] minister promised that the Ministry of Civil Aviation will begin running the airport as soon as the Uttar Pradesh government satisfied the demand for land. 

As of October 2023, the project is awaiting approval for land acquisition from Uttar Pradesh Government.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Goel |first=Sparsh |date=2023-08-03 |title=Meerut News: Airport Gets Green Signal for Operations, Receives Approval from Civil Aviation Ministry |url=https://www.dnpindia.in/states/meerut-news-airport-gets-green-signal-for-operations-receives-approval-from-civil-aviation-ministry/279638/ |access-date=2023-10-04 |website=DNP INDIA |language=en-GB}}</ref>

=== Expressways ===
Since Meerut has a very favourable location for industries and is suitable for being a logistics hub, it has many expressways like [[Delhi–Meerut Expressway|Delhi Meerut Expressway]], [[Ganga Expressway]]. It also is nearby (within 30 miles) of other expressways like [[Delhi–Mumbai Expressway|Delhi Mumbai Expressway]], [[Yamuna Expressway]], [[Western Peripheral Expressway|KMP Expressway]], and [[Eastern Peripheral Expressway]].
