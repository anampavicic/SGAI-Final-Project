Snowfall is usually moderate and remains on the ground briefly because of direct sun, with the city receiving {{convert|38|in|cm|0}} per season, although the mountains to the west often receive in excess of triple that amount; March is the snowiest month in the region, both by total accumulation and number of days with measurable snowfall.

Due to the high elevation and aridity, nights are usually relatively cool and rarely does the low remain above {{convert|70|°F|0}}.<ref name = NOAA/><!--As of Summer 2012, No. 10 extreme high daily minimum is {{convert|69|F}}--> Dry weather generally prevails, but brief afternoon thunderstorms are common, especially in July and August when the city receives the majority of its annual rainfall, due to the [[North American monsoon]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Evolution of the North American Monsoon |work=DRI Desert Research Institute |url=https://www.dri.edu/monsoon |url-status=dead |access-date=February 27, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227232120/https://www.dri.edu/monsoon |archive-date=February 27, 2017}}</ref>

The first autumn freeze and the last freeze in the spring, on average, occur on October 2 and May 6, respectively; the average window for measurable snowfall (≥{{convert|0.1|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is October 21 through April 25.

==Transportation==

===Major highways and roads===

====Interstate highways====
Colorado Springs is primarily served by one interstate highway. [[Interstate 25 in Colorado|I-25]] runs north and south through Colorado, and traverses the city for nearly {{convert|18|mi|km}}, entering the city south of Circle Drive and exiting north of North Gate Boulevard. In El Paso County it is known as Ronald Reagan Highway.{{efn|To combat congestion the Colorado Department of Transportation widened the Interstate 25 corridor throughout the city from four lanes (two in each direction) to six lanes in a program called COSMIX. Ultimately, the plan is to make the interstate eight lanes through the city when funding becomes available.<ref>{{cite web |title=Litter Removal Program |url=http://www.cosmixproject.com/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114182606/http://cosmixproject.com/ |archive-date=January 14, 2010 |access-date=September 15, 2010 |publisher=Colorado Department of Transportation's (CDOT)}}</ref>

Work has been completed to expand Interstate 25 from 4 to 6 lanes between Woodmen Road (exit 149, the northern terminus for the COSMIX project) and Monument (exit 161).<ref>{{cite web |title=I-25 North Design Build (Colorado Springs) – CDOT |url=http://www.coloradodot.info/projects/I25NorthCOSDB |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126175510/http://www.coloradodot.info/projects/I25NorthCOSDB |archive-date=January 26, 2013 |access-date=January 19, 2013 |publisher=Coloradodot.info}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Zubeck |first=Pam |date=December 29, 2012 |title=I-25 widening project coming soon {{pipe}} IndyBlog |url=http://www.csindy.com/IndyBlog/archives/2012/12/29/i-25-widening-project-coming-soon |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103025928/http://www.csindy.com/IndyBlog/archives/2012/12/29/i-25-widening-project-coming-soon |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 3, 2013 |access-date=January 19, 2013 |publisher=Csindy.com}}</ref>}}

====State and U.S. highways====
A number of state and U.S. highways serve the city. [[Colorado State Highway 21|State Highway 21]] is a major east side semi-expressway from [[Black Forest, Colorado|Black Forest]] to Fountain, known locally and co-signed as Powers Boulevard. [[Colorado State Highway 83|State Highway 83]] runs north–south from [[Denver|central Denver]] to northern Colorado Springs. [[Colorado State Highway 94|State Highway 94]] runs east–west from western [[Cheyenne County, Colorado|Cheyenne County]] to eastern Colorado Springs where it terminates at [[U.S. Route 24|US 24]]. US 24 is a major route through the city and county, providing access to Woodland Park via Ute Pass to the west and downtown, Nob Hill and numerous suburbs to the east. It is co-signed with Platte Ave after SH 21 and originally carried local traffic through town. The Martin Luther King Jr Bypass runs from I-25 near Circle Drive along Fountain Blvd to SH 21, then east again. [[Colorado State Highway 115|State Highway 115]] begins in [[Cañon City, Colorado|Cañon City]], traveling north along the western edge of Fort Carson; when it reaches the city limits it merges with Nevada Avenue, a signed Business Route of US 85. US 85 and SH 115 are concurrent between Lake Avenue and I-25. [[U.S. Route 85 in Colorado|US 85]] enters the city at Fountain and was signed at Venetucci Blvd, Lake Avenue, and Nevada Avenue{{efn|In addition, there were plans to develop a "Front Range Toll Road", a privately owned [[Toll road|turnpike]], which would begin south of Pueblo and end around Fort Collins. This toll road would allow rail and truck traffic to avoid the more highly traveled parts of I-25 along the Front Range. Initially, the project had support but has since been highly contested because of the need to condemn the land of many private citizens, through the use of [[eminent domain]], to make room for the corridor.<ref>{{cite web |title=? |url=http://www.nosuperslab.org/crap/how_to.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303061620/http://www.nosuperslab.org/crap/how_to.html |archive-date=March 3, 2014}}</ref>}} at various points in history; however most of US 85 is concurrent with I-25 and is not signed.

====County and city roads====
In November 2015, voters in Colorado Springs overwhelmingly passed ballot measure 2C, dedicating funds from a temporary sales tax increase to much needed road and infrastructure improvements over five years. This temporary increase is estimated to bring in approximately $50&nbsp;million annually, which will be used solely to improve roads and infrastructure. The ballot measure passed by a margin of approximately 65–35%.<ref>{{cite web |title=El Paso County Clerk and Recorder |url=http://www.elpasoelections.com/2015Coordinated/Results/results.html |access-date=February 10, 2016 |website=2015 Coordinated Election Results |archive-date=December 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151216073534/http://www.elpasoelections.com/2015Coordinated/Results/results.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Railroads===
Freight service is provided by [[Union Pacific]] and [[BNSF]].

Once an important hub, the city was once served by four [[Railroad classes|Class 1]] railroads, as well as a number of smaller operators, some of which were [[narrow gauge]],<ref>Ormes, R.M. ''Tracking Ghost Railroads in Colorado'', Century One Press 1975</ref> and an extensive [[tram|streetcar]] system, the [[Colorado Springs and Interurban Railway]].

Currently there is no intercity passenger service; the last remaining services connecting the Front Range cities ceased with the formation of [[Amtrak]] in 1971.{{efn| The last scheduled passenger service to Colorado Springs was the [[Denver]] to [[Dallas]] ''[[Texas Zephyr]]'', which was cancelled on September 11, 1967.}} [[Front Range Passenger Rail]] is a current proposal (as of 2023) to link the cities from [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]] in the south, north to [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]] and possibly [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Heins |first1=Nicole |title=Amtrak hopes to reduce I-25 traffic by creating a passenger rail along the Front Range |url=https://www.kktv.com/2021/04/13/amtrak-hopes-to-reduce-i-25-traffic-by-creating-a-passenger-rail-along-the-front-range/ |access-date=January 1, 2022 |work=KKTV 11 News |date=April 13, 2021 |language=en}}</ref>

Colorado Springs's sister city organization began when it became partners with Fujiyoshida. The ''torii'' gate erected to commemorate the relationship stands at the corner of Bijou Street and Nevada Avenue, and is one of the city's most recognizable landmarks. The [[Shinto|''torii'' gate]], crisscrossed bridge and shrine, in the median between Platte and Bijou Streets downtown, were a gift to Colorado Springs, erected in 1966 by the Rotary Club of Colorado Springs to celebrate the friendship between the two communities. A plaque near the ''torii'' gate states that "the purpose of the sister city relationship is to promote understanding between the people of our two countries and cities". The Fujiyoshida Student exchange program has become an annual event.<ref name="tomodachi">{{cite web |title=TOMODACHI NAJAS Grassroots Exchange ProgramーColorado Springs and Fujiyoshida |url=http://usjapantomodachi.org/programs-activities/2016-2017-tomodachi-colorado-springs-fujiyoshida-grassroots-exchange-program/ |access-date=April 19, 2020 |website=TOMODACHI |archive-date=January 5, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200105164125/http://usjapantomodachi.org/programs-activities/2016-2017-tomodachi-colorado-springs-fujiyoshida-grassroots-exchange-program/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2006 and 2010, the Bankstown TAP (Talent Advancement Program) performed with the Youth Symphony and the Colorado Springs Children's Chorale as part of the annual "In Harmony" program.<ref name="tomodachi" /> A notable similarity between Colorado Springs and its sister cities is their geographic positions: three of the seven cities are near the foot of a major mountain or mountain range, as is Colorado Springs.<ref>{{cite web |date=July 6, 2007 |title=City of Colorado Springs – Topic Pages |url=http://www.springsgov.com/Page.asp?NavID=1923 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514161758/http://www.springsgov.com/Page.asp?NavID=1923 |archive-date=May 14, 2008 |access-date=October 5, 2009 |publisher=Springsgov.com}}</ref>
