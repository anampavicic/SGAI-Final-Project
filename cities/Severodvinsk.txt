'''Severodvinsk''' ({{langx|ru|Северодви́нск}}; {{IPA|ru|sʲɪvʲɪrɐdˈvʲinsk|IPA}}) is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] in the north of [[Arkhangelsk Oblast]], [[Russia]], located in the [[river delta|delta]] of the [[Northern Dvina]], {{convert|35|km|sp=us}} west of [[Arkhangelsk]], the [[administrative center]] of the [[oblast]]. As of the [[Russian Census (2021)|2021 Census]], the population was 157,213.<ref name=2021Census>{{cite web|title=Оценка численности постоянного населения по субъектам Российской Федерации|url=https://rosstat.gov.ru/storage/mediabank/tab-5_VPN-2020.xlsx|publisher=[[Federal State Statistics Service (Russia)|Federal State Statistics Service]]|accessdate=1 September 2022}}</ref> Due to the presence of important military shipyards (specialising in submarines since the Soviet period), Severodvinsk is an access-restricted town for foreign citizens.

It was previously known as '''Sudostroy''' (until 1938),<ref name="ReferenceA" /> and '''Molotovsk''' (until 1957).<ref name="ReferenceA" />

==History==
=== Pre-20th century ===
[[Viking]]s explored the territories around the North Dvina River - part of [[Bjarmaland]] - at the start of the second millennium. British and Norman<ref name="ReferenceA">Severodvinsk—test of strength (Russian), "Pravda Severa" publishing house, 1998</ref>{{qn|date=February 2017}} ships came to these places for mining, fur and fishing before the 13th century, but later the climate became colder and access to the northern seas became closed.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The historical records first mention the settlement on the site of modern Severodvinsk in 1419, when the Swedes sailed into the bay and burnt down the [[Nikolo-Korelsky Monastery]] that stood by the shore during the [[Swedish–Novgorodian Wars]]. Tradition has it that [[Saint Euphemius]], an [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[missionary]] in [[Karelia]], founded this monastery. The abbey stood in ruins until 1471, when two sons of [[Marfa Boretskaya]] died in a vicious storm; their bodies were recovered on the beach near the monastery twelve days later. At the urging of Boretskaya, the monastery was restored and her sons were buried there.

On August&nbsp;24, 1553, a ship of [[Richard Chancellor]] reached the salt-mining settlement of [[Nyonoksa]], which is still famous for its traditional wooden architecture. The British sailors visited the Nikolo-Korelsky Monastery, where they were surprised to find a community of "sailors in [[soutane]]s (cassocks)" and a pier large enough to accommodate several ships.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The main church of this extraordinary establishment was dedicated to [[Saint Nicholas]], the holy [[patron]] of sailors; hence, the whole [[White Sea]] became known in 16th-century English maps as "St. Nicholas Bay". In late 1613, during the [[Time of Troubles]] in Russia, Polish-Lithuanian vagabonds, the [[Lisowczycy]], captured and looted Severodvinsk with the monastery.

The Nikolo-Korelsky Monastery flourished after the establishment of the [[Muscovy Company]], as the bulk of their trade passed through the local harbor. In August 1618 the harbour was visited by [[John Tradescant the elder]], who conducted a survey of an island situated opposite the monastery. This island became known to the British as "Rose Island", because it was there that Tradescant found an exceedingly rare plant which he named "[[Rosa moscovita]]" (which is now known as ''[[Rosa acicularis]]'') and brought back to [[London]].<ref>{{cite book|last= Hamel|first= Joseph|title= England and Russia: Comprising the Voyages of John Tradescant, the Elder...|date= January 1999|publisher= Adamant Media Corporation|pages= 282|isbn= 1-4021-8427-1}}</ref>
[[File:Korelski.jpg|thumb|left|View of the Nikolo-Korelsky Monastery in the early 20th century]]

The surviving buildings of the monastery were constructed at the close of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite]] period. The five-domed cathedral of St. Nicholas was built between 1670 and 1674, preceded by the Assumption church (1664–1667), to which it is joined by a gallery. Several decades later, the walls and towers were built of timber; the Soviets transported the best-preserved of these towers to [[Kolomenskoye]], [[Moscow]], where it still remains.

===Modern city===
Severodvinsk is the second-largest city in Arkhangelsk Oblast. Its main industry remains defense-related — the construction and repair of [[submarine]]s at the huge Northern Machine-building Enterprise [[Sevmash|SEVMASH]] (Северное Машиностроительное Предприятие-СЕВМАШ). The Soviet Union's first [[nuclear submarine]] [[Soviet submarine K-3 Leninsky Komsomol|''Leninsky Komsomol'']] was built here in 1957. At the beginning of the 1980s, the world's largest submarine, a [[Typhoon class submarine|Typhoon class]], was also built here, later recorded in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]''.

The modern city of Severodvinsk developed in the Soviet period. As it began to be built it was called '''Sudostroy''' ({{lang|ru|Судострой}} - "Boat-build").<ref name="ReferenceA"/> It received town status in 1938; until 1957, it was named '''Molotovsk''' ({{lang|ru|Молотовск}}), after [[Vyacheslav Molotov]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> On September&nbsp;12, 1957, it was renamed Severodvinsk (meaning "Northern Dvina town").

During [[World War II]], a significant portion of the materials delivered by the [[Arctic Convoys]] to [[Murmansk]] and [[Arkhangelsk]] for the Soviet Union were unloaded in Severodvinsk. For example, the ''[[Empire Elgar]]'', a British [[heavy lift ship]] that arrived in Arkhangelsk with convoy [[PQ 16]] and subsequently spent eight weeks unloading ships from the ill-fated [[convoy PQ 17]].

A Russian naval-base supports the sea trials of nuclear submarines from the major submarine construction- (64.5817 N, 39.8307 E) and repair-facilities located in the area. In Soviet times, the 17th-century buildings of the Nikolo-Korelsky monastery, located on the territory of the shipyard, were adapted and used for shipbuilding purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.edu.severodvinsk.ru/after_school/obl_www/2006/work/vanykov/xx.htm|title= XX век|publisher= Управление образования Северодвинска|language= ru|access-date= August 26, 2011}}</ref>  In recent years, the monastery buildings, specifically the main church, have been restored and re-consecrated.  Church-goers attending services have to be shipyard workers or able to obtain a pass to enter the church portion of the shipyard.

Severodvinsk is an access-restricted town for foreign citizens. A special pass is required.<ref name="pomorland.travel"/>

On 8 August 2019, a [[Nyonoksa radiation accident|nuclear accident]] took place on Russian Navy's Central Missile Range in [[Nyonoksa]], 30&nbsp;km to the west from Severodvinsk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://meduza.io/amp/en/feature/2019/08/27/new-russian-government-data-on-august-8-explosion-reveals-that-a-nuclear-reactor-was-definitely-involved|website=meduza.io|access-date=2019-08-31|title=New Russian government data on August 8 explosion reveals that a nuclear reactor was definitely involved}}</ref>

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is, together with eleven [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|rural localities]], incorporated as the '''[[city of federal subject significance|city of oblast significance]] of Severodvinsk'''—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Arkhangelsk Oblast|districts]].<ref name="ArkhangelskO_adm">Oblast Law #65-5-OZ</ref> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the city of oblast significance of Severodvinsk is incorporated as '''Severodvinsk Urban Okrug'''.<ref name="ArkhangelskO_mun">Oblast Law #258-vneoch.-OZ</ref>

From 1950 until 1990, [[high-tech]] industries generated demand for a considerable quantity of suitably qualified experts and workers which prompted growth in population. Since 1992, the population has declined due to economic crises and unemployment that has provoked significant migration from the city.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The city is located near the Nikolsky mouth of the [[Northern Dvina]] at its confluence with the [[White Sea]], 35&nbsp;km northwest of [[Arkhangelsk]], [[administrative centre]] of [[Arkhangelsk Oblast|the region]].

The area of Severodvinsk Urban Okrug, which includes the city of Severodvinsk and nearby rural settlements, is {{convert|1193.49|km2|mi2}}, which is more than the area of [[Moscow]] within the [[Moscow Ring Road|MKAD]]. It is due to the fact that in addition to the city of Severodvinsk a large forest area with its settlements (villages and dachas) to the south and west of the city is included in the boundaries of Severodvinsk Urban Okrug itself. The area of the city within the [[city]] limits is {{convert|120.5|km2|mi2}}.

The city is located at a latitude of 64°34′N, which means that it is possible to observe the [[Aurora|northern lights]].

=== Climate ===
Climate in Severodvinsk is [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]] according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]. Summers are cool and winters are very cold. The average winter temperature is lower than in the central, southern and even some northern (such as [[Saint Petersburg|Saint-Petersburg]]) regions of the [[European Russia|European part of Russia]]. In december the Sun rises after 9 am and sets before 4 pm. But from May 17 to July 27 [[White night (astronomy)|white nights]] are observed in the city.{{Weather box

The main role of the city has been, and remains, the production and repair of submarines and military ships. During the [[Cold War]], the city prospered, but with the decline and break-up of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War the city has declined. The city's large military enterprises have survived the economic crises of the 1990s and have adjusted to new economic conditions. Severodvinsk now has the largest shipbuilding yard in Russia for large ships (tankers, cargo ships).
