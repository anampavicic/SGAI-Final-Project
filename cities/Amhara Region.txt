The '''Amhara Region''' ({{lang-am|አማራ ክልል|Åmara Kilil}}), officially the '''Amhara National Regional State''' ({{Lang-am|የአማራ ብሔራዊ ክልላዊ መንግሥት}}),<ref>{{Cite web |date=29 March 2022 |title=Amhara Regional State |url=https://www.ethiopia.gov.et/regional-states/amhara-regional-state/ }}{{Dead link|date=August 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> is a [[Regions of Ethiopia|regional state]] in northern [[Ethiopia]] and the homeland of the [[Amhara people|Amhara]], [[Awi people|Awi]], [[Xamir people|Xamir]], [[Argobba people|Argoba]], and [[Qemant people|Qemant]] people. Its capital is [[Bahir Dar]] which is the seat of the [[Government of Amhara Region|Regional Government of Amhara]]. Amhara is the site of the largest inland body of water in Ethiopia, [[Lake Tana]] (which is the source of the [[Blue Nile]]), and [[Semien Mountains National Park]] (which includes [[Ras Dashan]], the highest point in Ethiopia). Amhara is bordered by [[Sudan]] to the west and northwest and by other the regions of Ethiopia: [[Tigray Region|Tigray]] to the north, [[Afar Region|Afar]] to the east, [[Benishangul-Gumuz Region|Benishangul-Gumuz]] to the west and southwest, and [[Oromia]] to the south. Towns and cities in Amhara include: [[Bahir Dar]], [[Dessie]], [[Gondar|Gonder]], [[Debre Birhan]], [[Debre Tabor]], [[Kombolcha]], [[Weldiya]], [[Debre Markos]], [[Soqota|Seqota]], [[Kobo, Ethiopia|Kobo]], and [[Metemma|Metema]].

== History ==
During the [[Ethiopian Empire]], Amhara included several provinces (such as [[Bete Amhara]], [[Gojjam]], [[Gonder]], [[Angot]], [[Dembiya]], [[Shewa]] and  [[Lasta Province|Lasta]]), most of which were ruled by native [[Ras (title)|Ras]] or [[Negus]]. The current Amhara region corresponds to often large parts of the former provinces of [[Begemder]], [[Dembiya]], [[Angot]], [[Bete Amhara]], [[Gojjam]] and [[Shewa]].<ref name="blackhurst427">{{Cite journal|last=Blackhurst|first=Hector|date=October 1974|title=Church and State in Ethiopia, 1270–1527.

This period is most significant in the formation of the medieval Ethiopian state, the spread and consolidation of [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity]] (following the example set by the [[Zagwe]] kings in preserving the [[Kingdom of Aksum|Axumite]] heritage) and propagating to the core provinces (besides [[Tigray Province|Tigray]]/[[Eritrea]], and [[Lasta]]) of [[Bete Amhara]], [[Gojjam]], [[Begemder]], northern [[North Shewa Zone (Amhara)|Shewa]], [[Gafat language|Gafat]], and [[Kingdom of Damot|Damot]]<ref name="blackhurst427"/>

The region's recorded history, in fact, goes back to the early 13th century. For example, St. George's Church in the town of Woreilu (whose Tabot is reputed to have been carried by [[Menelik II|Emperor Menelik]] at the [[Battle of Adwa]]) was established around 1200.

The parish of Mekane Selassie (መካነ ሥላሴ), near Neded and the home of the cathedral by the same name, served as a favourite royal playground. The construction of Mekane Selassie (meaning: the abode of the Trinity) was begun by [[Na'od|Emperor Naod]] (1494-1508) and completed by his son Emperor [[Dawit II|Lebna Dengel]]. This was a year before the church (along with a large number of monasteries in the region) was sacked and burned down in 1531 by the invasion led by [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi|Ahmad bin Ibrahim]]. Francisco Alvarez, who had earlier visited the church, confirms that its size was some 150 feet by 150 feet — wholly covered in gold leaf, inlaid with gems, pearls and corals<ref>{{Cite book|date=15 May 2017|editor-last=Beckingham|editor-first=C.F.|editor2-last=Huntingford|editor2-first=G.W.B.|title=The Prester John of the Indies|doi=10.4324/9781315554013|isbn=9781315554013}}</ref>

=== 21st century ===
After the social movements of 2014–2017, [[Amhara nationalism]] developed strongly in the region, with a discourse that includes both issues of power balance between elites and territorial claims. Several local politicians, such as Dejene Maru backed by General [[Asaminew Tsige]], were able to control armed factions.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=17 November 2020|editor-last=Labzaé|editor-first=Mehdi|title=" Tedjemerwal " : ressorts sociaux, enjeux matériels et significations locales d'une entrée en guerre|url=https://polaf.hypotheses.org/7196 |journal=[[Politique Africaine]]}}</ref>

On 22 June 2019, factions of the security forces of the region attempted a [[2019 Amhara region coup d'état attempt|coup d'état]] against the regional government, during which the President of the Amhara region, [[Ambachew Mekonnen]], was assassinated.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethiopiaobserver.com/2019/06/23/president-of-the-amhara-region-killed-regional-media/|title=President of the Amhara region killed|date=23 June 2019|work=Ethiopia Observer|access-date=24 June 2019}}</ref> A bodyguard siding with the nationalist factions assassinated General [[Se'are Mekonnen]] – the [[Chief of General Staff (Ethiopia)|Chief of the General Staff]] of the [[Ethiopian National Defense Force]] – as well as his aide, Major General Gizae Aberra.<ref name=":0" /> The Prime Minister's Office accused Brigadier General Asaminew Tsige, head of the Amhara region security forces, of leading the plot,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/06/23/735236160/ethiopia-army-chief-killed-in-attempted-coup-government-says|title=Ethiopia Army Chief Killed In Attempted Coup, Government Says|last=Ingber|first=Sasha|date=23 June 2019|work=NPR|access-date=24 June 2019}}</ref> and Tsige was shot dead by police near Bahir Dar on 24 June.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/africa/1561381510-ethiopian-coup-mastermind-shot-dead-after-36-hour-manhunt|title=Alleged Ethiopian coup mastermind shot dead after 36-hour manhunt|date=24 June 2019|work=i24 news|access-date=24 June 2019}}</ref>

In April 2023, a strife occurred between the [[Ethiopian Regional Special Forces|regional special forces]] of [[Government of Ethiopia|federal government]] and Fano militia units, advancing to large scale protests in [[Gondar]], [[Kobo, Ethiopia|Kobo]], [[Soqota|Seqota]], [[Weldiya]] on 9 April. Further insurgency was escalated between the two belligerents, resulted in [[War in Amhara]]. Since August 2023, [[Fano (militia)|Fano]] militants and [[Ethiopian National Defense Force|ENDF]] troops intermittently controlled most part of the region, leading to major human rights violations and subsequent [[2023 Ethiopian state of emergency|state of emergency]]. Since the outbreak of the war, the region experienced internal displacements, extrajudicial killings and extensive property damages.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ford |first=Neil |date=2023-05-05 |title=Ethiopia: Crackdown in Amhara risks escalating conflict |url=https://newafricanmagazine.com/29560/ |access-date=2024-08-06 |website=New African Magazine |language=en-GB}}</ref>  According to the [[Ethiopian Human Rights Commission]] (EHRC) reports, 45 civilians were killed in Amhara region by security forces for allegedly supporting Fano in late January 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ethiopian forces killed ‘at least 45 citizens’ in Amhara, rights body says |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/13/ethiopian-forces-killed-at-least-45-citizens-in-amhara-rights-body-says |access-date=2024-08-06 |website=Al Jazeera |language=en}}</ref>

== Geography ==

===Water flow===
The Amhara region is home to 6 lakes: [[Lake Tana]], [[Lake Hayq]], [[Lake Hardibo]], [[Lake Ashenge]], [[Lake zengena]] and Lake Tirba.
[[File:Bahir Dar (6821421459).jpg|thumb|211x211px|Amhara man riding a boat on the shores of Lake Tana.]]
[[File:Blue Nile Falls Ethiopia II.jpg|thumb|The [[Blue Nile Falls]] near [[Bahir Dar]]]]

According to the Ethiopian government website, the Amhara Highlands receive 80% of [[Ethiopia]]’s total annual rainfall of and are the country's most fertile and climatically hospitable region.<ref>The Amhara National Regional State – Ethiopian Government Portal. 2017.  [Online] Available at http://www.ethiopia.gov.et/stateamhara {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202134803/http://www.ethiopia.gov.et/stateamhara |date=2 February 2017 }}. [Accessed 30 January 2017].</ref> [[Lake Tana]], in the Amhara Region, is the source of the [[Blue Nile]]—at [[Bahir Dar]]. When the Blue Nile's flow is at maximum volume (during the rainy season from June to September), it supplies about two-thirds of the water of the Nile proper. Until the 1970 completion of the [[Aswan High Dam]] in Egypt, the Blue Nile, together with the [[Atbara River]] to its north (which also flows out of the Ethiopian Highlands), caused annual Nile floods that contributed to the fertility of the Nile Valley. This aided the rise of [[ancient Egyptian]] civilization, which in turn enabled the development of [[Egyptian mythology]].

=== Lake Tana ===
Lake Tana contains several islands, whose numbers vary depending on the water level in the lake. (Over the last 400 years, that level has fallen about {{convert|2|m|ft}}.) In the early 17th century, according to a contemporaneous report by [[Manoel de Almeida]], a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[missionary]], there were 21 islands, which he described as "formerly large, but now much diminished,” and seven or eight of them had [[monasteries]] on them.<ref name="Beckham"/> In the late 18th century, [[James Bruce]] visited the area and noted that, though the locals reported that there were 45 inhabited islands, he believed that "the number may be about eleven."<ref name="Beckham"/> A mid-twentieth-century account reported 37 islands and said that 19 of were the current or former sites of either monasteries or churches.<ref name="Beckham">C.F. Beckham and G.W.B. Huntingford, ''Some Records of Ethiopia, 1593-1646'', (series 2, no. 107; London: [[Hakluyt Society]], 1954), p. 35 and note.</ref>

[[File:SemienWaterfall.jpg|thumb|right|Jin Bahir Falls in the [[Semien Mountains]]]]

The lake islands were the home of ancient Ethiopian emperors. Treasures of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Church]] are kept in the isolated island monasteries (including Kebran Gabriel, [[Ura Kidane Mehret]], Narga Selassie, [[Daga Estifanos]], Medhane Alem of [[Rema Island|Rema]], Kota Maryam and Mertola Maryam). The body of [[Yekuno Amlak]] is interred in the monastery of St. Stephen on [[Daga Island]]; other Emperors whose tombs are on Daga include [[Dawit I of Ethiopia|Dawit I]], [[Zara Yaqob]], [[Za Dengel]] and [[Fasilides of Ethiopia|Fasilides]]. Other important islands in Lake Tana include [[Dek Island|Dek]], [[Mitraha Island|Mitraha]], [[Gelila Zakarias]], [[Halimun]], and [[Briguida]].

In the late 20th century, the scholar [[Paul B. Henze]] reported being shown a rock on the island of [[Tana Qirqos]] and being told it was where the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] had rested during her journey back from [[Egypt]]. He was also told that [[Saint Frumentius]], the bishop known for introducing [[Christianity]] to Ethiopia, was "allegedly buried on Tana Cherqos."<ref>Paul B. Henze, ''Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia'' (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p.73</ref>

The Amhara region has the most world heritage sites of any region in Ethiopia and is endowed with natural and geographic wonders and ecosystems. The region contains Ethiopia's largest inland body of water [[Lake Tana]], which is the source of the [[Blue Nile]] river. In 2015 Lake Tana was recognized as a [[UNESCO Biosphere Reserve]] for its enormous biodiversity, and national and international importance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/biosphere/africa/lake-tana|title=Lake Tana Biosphere Reserve, Ethiopia|date=22 October 2018}}</ref> The [[Semien Mountains National Park]] has been designated as one of the first natural [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in the world, and the very first in Africa in the ''natural'' criteria since 1978.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.simienmountains.org/the-park/world-heritage-site#:~:text=In+1978+Simien+Mountains+National,precipices+dropping+some+1,500+m|title=Simien Mountains &#124; World Heritage Site|website=www.simienmountains.org|accessdate=28 March 2022}}</ref> Chosen for its spectacular landscapes and global significance for biodiversity conservation.

Amhara region also leads in cultural world heritage sites in Ethiopia, with the Rock Hewn Churches of [[Lalibela]] jointly added with Senegal's [[Gorée]] island as Africa's first [[World Heritage Sites|World Heritage site]] by [[Unesco]] in the ''cultural'' criteria in 1978. Lalibela and its medieval [[monolith]]ic churches attracts by far the most number of pilgrims annually of any religious site in Ethiopia. The '''New Jerusalem''' was built in response to [[History of Jerusalem|the capture of old Jerusalem]] by Muslim forces during the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)]], after which Muslims denied Ethiopian Christians pilgrimages to the Holy land.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/18/|title=Rock-Hewn Churches, Lalibela|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|accessdate=28 March 2022}}</ref> [[Unesco]] also added [[Fasil Ghebbi]] in 1979 as a cultural [[World Heritage Site]]. The ''Royal Enclosure'' of [[Fasil Ghebbi]] was the seat of the Ethiopian Emperors in [[Gondar]] the royal capital for more than two centuries(1636 to 1864 AD). The Fasil Ghebbi consist of some twenty palaces, royal buildings, the royal library, a [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancellery]], a banqueting hall, stables for the horses, highly decorated churches, monasteries and unique public and private buildings that was built during the reign of several emperors in the Gondarine period. The complex covers an area of 70 square kilometers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/19/|title = Fasil Ghebbi, Gondar Region}}</ref>

The predominant religion of the Amhara for centuries has been Christianity, with the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] playing a central role in the culture of the Amhara region. According to the 2007 census, 82.5% of the population of the Amhara region (which is 91.2% Amhara) were Ethiopian Orthodox; 17.2% were Muslim, and 0.2% were [[Protestantism|Protestant]] ("[[P'ent'ay]]").<ref name="csa" /> The Ethiopian Orthodox Church maintains close links with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]. Easter and [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] are the most important celebrations, marked with services, feasting and dancing. There are also many fast days throughout the year, when only vegetables or fish may be eaten.

==Government==
The [[Government of Amhara Region|government of Amhara]] is composed of the executive branch, led by the President; the legislative branch, which comprises the State Council; and the judicial branch, which is led by the state Supreme Court.

===Executive branch===
The executive branch is headed by the Chief Administrator of Amhara Region. The current Chief Administrator is Yilikal Kefale, a [[Prosperity Party]] member who was elected on 30 September 2021. The current vice president is Alemnew Mekonnen. The other offices in the executive branch cabinet are the Regional Health Bureau (Dr. Abebaw Gebeyehu), Educational Bureau (Yilikal Kefyalew), and 20 other officials.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ena.gov.et/en/index.php/politics/item/2316-amhara-region-announces-appointment-of-22-cabinet-members|title=Amhara Region Announces Appointment of 22 Cabinet Members|date=23 November 2016|work=Ethiopian News Agency|access-date=24 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305063950/http://www.ena.gov.et/en/index.php/politics/item/2316-amhara-region-announces-appointment-of-22-cabinet-members|archive-date=5 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Judicial branch ===
There are three levels of the Amhara state [[judiciary]]. The lowest level is the court of common pleas: each woreda maintains its own constitutionally mandated court of common pleas, which maintain jurisdiction over all justiciable matters. The intermediate-level court system is the district court system. Four courts of appeals exist, each retaining jurisdiction over appeals from common pleas, municipal, and county courts in an administrative zone. A case heard in this system is decided by a three-judge panel, and each judge is elected.

The highest-ranking court, the Amhara Supreme Court, is Amhara's "court of last resort". A seven-justice panel composes the court, which, by its own discretion, hears appeals from the courts of appeals, and retains original jurisdiction over limited matters. The chief judge is called the President of Amhara Supreme Court (Yeneneh Simegn).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jfapfe.org/News1.html|title=MOU Signing ceremony With Federal and Regional Supreme Courts of Ethiopia to Facilitate Support for Clearance of Backlog Files|date=14 August 2015|website=Justice For All-PF Ethiopia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105024748/http://www.jfapfe.org/News1.html|archive-date=5 November 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=8 July 2017}}</ref>
