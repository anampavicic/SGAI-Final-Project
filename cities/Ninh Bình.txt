[[File:Citadel of Ninh Binh.jpg|thumb|left|The citadel of Ninh Bình (1884)]]
During the [[Nguyen dynasty]], in August 1884 in the [[Tonkin campaign]], the allegiance of Ninh Bình was of considerable importance to the French, as artillery mounted in its lofty citadel controlled river traffic to the [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. Although the Vietnamese authorities in Ninh Bình made no attempt to hinder the passage of an expedition launched by [[Henri Rivière (naval officer)|Henri Rivière]] in March 1883 [[Capture of Nam Định (1883)|to capture Nam Định]], they were known to be hostile towards the French. In November 1883, on the eve of the [[Sơn Tây campaign]], the French occupied the citadel of Ninh Bình without resistance and installed a garrison.
