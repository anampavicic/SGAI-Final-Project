'''Rufisque''' ({{langx|ar|روفيسك}}; [[Wolof language|Wolof]]: Tëngeéj) is a city in the [[Dakar]] region of western [[Senegal]], at the base of the [[Cap-Vert]] [[Peninsula]] {{convert|25|km}} east of [[Dakar]], the capital. It has a population of 295,459 (2023 census).<ref name="pop">[https://www.citypopulation.de/en/senegal/cities/ Citypopulation.de] Population of the major cities in Senegal</ref> In the past it was an important port city in its own right, but is now a [[suburb]] of Dakar.

Rufisque is also the capital of the [[departments of Senegal|department]] of the [[Rufisque Department|same name]].

== History ==
[[File:Rufisco.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of ''Rufisco'' in [[1732]].]]

Originally a [[Lebou]] fishing village called Tenguedj ({{langx|wo|'''Tëngéej'''}}), Rufisque became important in the 16th century as the principal port of the kingdom of [[Cayor]], being frequented by Portuguese (who named it ''Rio Fresco'', meaning "Freshwater River", hence the name of the modern city), Dutch, French and English traders. A Euro-African [[Creole peoples|Creole]], or [[Métis]], community of merchants grew up there, in close contact with similar communities in [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint Louis]], [[Gorée]] and other places along the Petite Côte ([[Saly-Portudal]], [[Joal]]) south to the [[Gambia River]].{{cn|date = October 2024}} By the 1650s, the [[Dutch West India Company]] had consolidated control over the coastal trade and built a fortified factory at Rufisque.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jacobs |first1=Bart |editor1-last=Green |editor1-first=Toby |editor1-link=Toby Green |title=Brokers of Change: Atlantic Commerce and Cultures in Pre-Colonial Western Africa |date=2012 |publisher=Proceedings of the British Academy |location=London |chapter=The Dutch in Seventeenth-Century Senegambia and the Emergence of Papiamentu|page=207}}</ref>

In 1840 a couple of Saint Louis merchants built warehouses on the waterfront to stock [[peanut]]s. Gorée merchants followed suit. There followed a period of commercial expansion as peanut production in Cayor boomed. In 1859 a fort was built by the French and Rufisque was annexed to the [[French West Africa|Colony of Senegal]]. The "Escale" commercial and administrative neighborhood along the waterfront was laid out in 1862—the African inhabitants being pushed out in the process. Rufisque became a "commune" in 1880 and its port was connected to the Dakar-Saint Louis railroad in 1885.{{cn|date= October 2024}} In 1909 [[Galandou Diouf]] (died 1941) was elected to represent Rufisque in the General Council of the colony in Saint Louis, being the first African elected to that position.<ref name=":02">{{Cite book|last=Lawrence|first=Adria K.|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/imperial-rule-and-the-politics-of-nationalism/C25DB67F2AABEA1097273FF7D0518556|title=Imperial Rule and the Politics of Nationalism: Anti-Colonial Protest in the French Empire|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-03709-0|pages=109–110}}</ref>

===Decline of port===
[[File:Rufisque-Plage (AOF).jpg|thumb|right|Beach in Rufisque]]
Early in the 20th century the growth of neighboring Dakar, with its superior port facilities, signaled the decline of Rufisque. No longer an active port, Rufisque has experienced steep industrial decline. Relatively neglected compared to rest of Senegal's [[Four Communes|four historic communes]], it has no tourism sector and a chronic lack of investment in public infrastructure.{{cn|date = October 2024}}
