==History==
The first written mentions of Nyíregyháza date back to 1209, although it was then called simply ''Nyír'' ('[[birch]]'), after the ''Nyírség'', the greater region in which the city lies. A source from 1326 <!--OR 1236?-->mentions that by then the city already had a [[Church (building)|church]], hence the second part of the name, ''egyház'' (meaning 'church'). By the middle of the 15th century, the town had about 400 inhabitants. In the 16th century, during the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] occupation of Hungary, Nyíregyháza became deserted; it was resettled only in the 1630s–1640s.

After the [[Rákóczi's War for Independence|War for Independence]] led by Prince [[Francis II Rákóczi]], the town's population increased. Most new settlers were [[Slovaks]] from the area of [[Békéscsaba]]. In 1786, Nyíregyháza was granted the right to hold four market days a year; by this time the town was the biggest in the county, with 7,500 inhabitants. In the early 19th century, Nyíregyháza was wealthy enough to secure freedom from its [[Feudalism|feudal]] lords, the Dessewffy and Károlyi families. During these prosperous years, the town got a new town hall, a hospital, several schools, and a restaurant by nearby ''Sóstó'' lake ("Salty Lake").

The town's inhabitants took an active part in the [[Hungary#From the 18th century to World War I (1699–1918)|revolution and war for independence in 1848–49]], and after the suppression of the revolution, several were imprisoned, among them the mayor, Márton Hatzel.

In the second half of the 19th century, Nyíregyháza became more and more urbanized, and in 1876, became the seat of [[Szabolcs County]] (now part of the larger integrated county [[Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg]]). In 1858, the railroad line reached Nyíregyháza; several new buildings were built, including a telegraph office, the main post office, and the theater. In 1881 the population consisted of 24,102 people, of which 13,534 were Hungarians, 8,678 Slovaks, 389 Germans and 1,501 of other ethnicities.<ref>{{cite web|language=hu|url=https://library.hungaricana.hu/hu/view/NEDA_1881_02/?pg=0&layout=s|title=Hungarian 1881 census|access-date=8 December 2022}}</ref> In 1911, the tramway network was complete. After the grim years of [[World War I]] and the [[Hungarian–Romanian War]], Nyíregyháza remained under [[Romania]]n occupation for ten months. Between the two world wars, the city celebrated the 100th anniversary of its independence from feudal landowners.

During [[World War II]], [[Jews]] were used as [[Forced labour|forced laborers]] by Hungarians. After the [[Operation Margarethe|German invasion]], more than 6,000 of the city's Jewish inhabitants were [[Holocaust|deported]] to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Pinkas Hakehillot Hungary: Nyiregyhaza|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/pinkas_hungary/hun379.html|website=www.jewishgen.org}}</ref><ref name="auto2">{{cite web|last=Seemann|first=Uwe|title=Information Portal to European Sites of Remembrance|url=http://www.memorialmuseums.org/eng/staettens/view/956/Ny%C3%ADregyh%C3%A1za-Holocaust-Memorial27247|website=www.memorialmuseums.org}}</ref> After the war, 2,000 Hungarians were sent to [[Forced labor of Hungarians in the Soviet Union|Soviet labor camps]] (colloquially called ''[[malenky robot]]'', or "little work"). Several buildings were destroyed, too, including the Status Quo Synagogue, whose front wall was preserved and is now displayed in Nyíregyháza's Jewish Cemetery.<ref>[[Grand Rabbi|Chief Rabbi]] Joseph Leifer of Nyíregyháza is buried in the cemetery. He was the son of the world-renowned Rabbi Mordachai of Nadvorna, and settled in Nyíregyháza after World War I, attracting a large following there. His grave is visited annually by thousands of Hasidim.</ref>

A monument in the memory of the [[Holocaust]] victims was constructed in 2004.<ref name="auto2" />

From the 1960s, the city grew and developed quickly. Today, Nyíregyháza is one of the most prosperous cities in Hungary, serving as both a center of education and a popular tourist destination. It is known for having a bar in every street.

Nyíregyháza is the birthplace of Israeli artist [[Zeev Kun]] (1930-2024).

==Population==
With a population of 118,001, Nyíregyháza is the seventh-largest city in Hungary.

== Economy ==
After the [[End of socialism in Hungary|fall of Communism]], several foreign-owned companies appeared in the city. In the early 2000s, the largest employers were Hübner Flextronics Ltd. and Hirsch's, but during the period of economic recession, many companies eliminated several thousand jobs. Today, the largest public companies are the [[Lego]] Manufacturing Kft. and the [[Michelin]] Hungaria Abroncsgyártó Kft., providing employment for about 3,000 people.

== Transportation ==
National road traffic to Budapest goes through the [[M3 motorway (Hungary)|M3 motorway]] and four national highways (4, 36, 38, 41) and the lower state roads, other cities of the country and the settlements of Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg county. Szabolcs Volán Zrt. Launches long-haul flights to major cities in the region and to larger towns in the country.

Due to the nature of the city junction, Nyíregyháza's road network is heavily loaded. The city center is surrounded by a 2X2-lane "highway". And the narrow city center is bordered by the "small boulevard", the northern, eastern and southern parts of which have already been completed. The M3 motorway, which recently reached the city, will hopefully reduce traffic and congestion on roads passing through the city center. At the same time the motorway reached the city, the east bypass (main road 403) was opened, allowing those traveling between Budapest and Záhony to avoid the city. Those coming to Debrecen no longer have to cross the city. The Nyíregyháza ring road includes the already completed 403 road and the M3 motorway south of the city. The missing parts of the ring road are Highway 338 (already authorized, but with an unknown construction date) in the west and the northern sector.

The most important of its railway connections is the 100 electric tram line between Szolnok and Záhony, from where the number 80 line to Tokaj, 113 line to Mátészalka and 116 line to Vásárosnamény branch out.
