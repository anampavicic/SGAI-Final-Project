==Economy==
Rui'an has been a rich and prosperous city since ancient times. However, it was not until the practice of economic reform and opening that Rui'an regained its momentum. The people of Rui'an have been pioneers in many fields, especially in the development of China's market economy in the form of joint-stock system.

They set up a household contract responsibility system, which would encourage the citizens to take lead in the household industries, and they tried their best to sell their products. Consequently, Rui'an experienced fast economic development. The government induced the rural entrepreneurs and shareholders to cooperate effectively. Many kinds of economic systems have been introduced in Rui'an, making regional development speedier. One such system is the famous “Wenzhou Pattern“, which became well known both in China and abroad.

In 2005, Rui'an ranked 39th place in comprehensive economic strength among the first 100 counties and cities of China. In the 20 square kilometer economic development zone at the provincial level, there is enthusiasm{{by whom|date=May 2024}} for capital investment in building Rui'an into a new urban area with comprehensive development of industry, trade, science and technology. Rui'an is also known for its production of plastics and auto accessories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ruian.gov.cn/zjra/|title=社会经济|website=www.ruian.gov.cn|access-date=November 30, 2016}}</ref>

==Transportation==
The infrastructure of Rui'an has improved{{when|date=May 2024}}, with an ever-quickening pace of urbanization. Now, it has modernized traffic control, transportation and communication systems. The [[Wenzhou Yongqiang Airport]], a 10,000-ton seaport and the local railway station are each less than 30 kilometers from the city proper. The [[G15 Shenyang–Haikou Expressway|coastal highway]] and the [[China National Highway 104|No. 104 state highway]] which run through the city, and the [[Rui'an railway station|Rui'an station]] on the [[Wenzhou–Fuzhou railway]] are a few significant examples of developments in transportation in Rui'an.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ruian.gov.cn/zjra/|title=地理交通|website=www.ruian.gov.cn/zjra/|access-date=November 30, 2016}}</ref> The [[Line S2 (Wenzhou Rail Transit)|Rail Transit Line 2]], which started operation on April 26, 2023, arrives in Rui'an.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ZYaf9g7nJRdaQlESGGxvlQ|title=定了！8月26日12点！ 温州轨道交通S2线开通运营 |date=2023-08-24|website=WeChat|lang=zh}}</ref>

Situated about 100 nautical miles away from the estuary of Feiyunjiang, there lies the seabed rich in crude oil and natural gas, which are now being prospected and planned to be excavated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ruian.gov.cn/zjra/ |script-title=zh:自然资源|website=www.ruian.gov.cn/zjra/|access-date=November 30, 2016}}</ref>
