==History==
[[File:Fethiye by Piri Reis.jpg|thumb|left|Historic map of Fethiye by [[Piri Reis]]]]
Fethiye was formerly known as '''Makri''' ({{Langx|el|Μάκρη}}).<ref name="Darke" /><ref name="ODB" /> Modern Fethiye is located on the site of the ancient city of [[Telmessos]], the ruins of which can be seen in the city, e.g. the [[Hellenistic]] [[theatre]] by the main quay.

A Lycian legend explains the source of the name Telmessos as follows: The god [[Apollo]] falls in love with the youngest daughter of the King of [[Phoenicia]], [[Agenor]]. He disguises himself as a small dog and thus, gains the love of the shy, withdrawn daughter. After he reappears as a handsome man, they have a son, who they name 'Telmessos' (the land of lights).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The city became part of the [[Persian Empire]] after the invasion of the Persian general [[Harpagos]] in 547 BC, along with other Lycian and [[Caria]]n cities. Telmessos then joined the [[Delian League|Attic-Delos Union]] ([[Delian League]]) established in mid-5th century BC. and, although it later left the union and became an independent city, it continued its relations with the union until the 4th century BC. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}
[[File:Lycian sarcophagus in ancient Telmessos.jpg|thumb|Lycian sarcophagus in the ancient city [[Telmessos]].]]
Very little is known of the city during the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times. Surviving buildings attest to considerable prosperity during [[late Antiquity]], but most were abandoned in the 7th–8th centuries due to the [[Arab-Byzantine Wars]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The city was fortified in the 8th century, and appears as "Telmissos or [[Telmessos|Anastasioupolis]]" ca. 800. By the 10th century, the ancient name was forgotten and it became known as '''Makre''' or '''Makri''' (Μάκρη, "long one"), from the name of the island at the entrance to the harbour.<ref name="Darke">Diana Darke, ''Guide to Aegean and Mediterranean Turkey'', M. Haag, 1986, 296 pages. Page 165, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GCQEG97wu2MC&q=Makri+population+exchange The town grew considerably at the end of the 19th century, and until the exchange of Greco-Turkish populations in 1923 it had a large Greek population. Its name at that time was Makri in modern Greek.]</ref> There are signs of renewed prosperity in the 12-13th centuries: the city walls were enlarged, a report from 1106 names Makre a centre for perfume production, and geographical works from the 13th century describe the city as a commercial center. The area fell to the Turks in the late 12th or early 13th century.<ref name="ODB">{{cite encyclopedia | last1 = Foss " |first1=Clive | last2 = Kazhdan | first2 = Alexander P. | title = Makre | pages = 1271–1272 | editor-last = Kazhdan | editor-first = Alexander P. | editor-link = Alexander Kazhdan | encyclopedia = [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | location= New York; Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | year=1991 | isbn=978-0-19-504652-6}}</ref>

Telmessos was ruled by the [[Anatolian beylik]] of [[Menteşe (beylik)|Menteşe]] starting in 1284, under the name ''Beskaza''.

It became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1424, and was called مكرى ''Meğri'' until 1934.<ref name="sezen">Tahir Sezen, ''Osmanlı Yer Adları'', Ankara 2017, T.C.

From 1867 until 1922, Meğri was part of the [[Aidin Vilayet]] of the [[Turkish Empire]]. The town grew considerably in the 19th century, and had a large [[Greeks|Greek]] population at that time.<ref name="Darke"/> Following the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], the Greeks of Makri were sent to Greece where they founded the town of [[Nea Makri]] (New Makri) in [[Greece]].<ref name="Darke"/> The town was resettled with [[Turkish people|Turks]] from Greece. At nearby [[Kayaköy]], formerly Levissi, the abandoned [[Greek Orthodox]] church is still standing.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In 1934, the city was renamed Fethiye in honor of Captain {{Ill|Fethi Bey (pilot)|lt=Fethi Bey|de}}, one of the first pilots of the [[Ottoman Air Force]], who died (together with First Lieutenant {{Ill|Sadık Bey|lt=Tayyareci Sadık Bey|tr}}) during an airplane crash on 27 February 1914 near [[Al-Samra]], while attempting to complete the first flight from [[Istanbul]] to [[Cairo]].<ref>[http://www.hadassahmagazine.org/2014/03/17/letter-kibbutz-haon-fallen-flyers/ Letter from Kibbutz Ha’On: Fallen Flyers] Hadassah Magazine, 17 March 2014</ref>

On 3 August 1953, [[Air France Flight 152]], while en route from [[Rome]] to [[Beirut]], ditched into the [[Gulf of Fethiye]] off [[Kızılada, Fethiye|Kızılada]]. Of the 8 crew and 34 passengers on board, four drowned.

==Transport==

[[Dalaman Airport]] serves the Fethiye areas. The most common type of public transportation in Fethiye and nearby area is minibus, commonly known in Turkey as dolmuş (dol-moosh) and numerous routes connect Fethiye with [[Ölüdeniz]], Yaniklar, Kargi, Hisaronu, Ovacik, Seydikemer, Karaçulha.

== Areas ==
The overall metropolitan area of the city of Fethiye stretches inland from the harbor for more than 11&nbsp;km, incorporating several villages into the city. To the north of the city center is the area of Çalış Plajı (Beach), which incorporates the main street of [[Barış Manço]] Bulvarı alongside an extensive promenade along the coast, on which a lot of hotels are based. This beach serves as Fethiye's beach in its own right, since Fethiye does not actually have one itself. To the east, lie the areas of Günlükbaşı, Çamköy, Cumhuriyet, and also Esenköy to the south-east. The city center is defined as the area between the Marina and the Fethiye Market near the football stadium. Approximately 4&nbsp;km to the south-west and south respectively, lie the towns of [[Kayaköy]] and [[Ölüdeniz]], the latter being world-famous for its beach spit and associated Blue Lagoon. The opportunity for paragliding is available from the mountain of Babadağ in Ölüdeniz, from various extreme sports companies located in the area.
