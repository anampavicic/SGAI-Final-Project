'''Kawit''', officially the '''Municipality of Kawit''' ({{lang-tgl|Bayan ng Kawit}}),  is a 1st class urban [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Cavite]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 107,535.{{PH census|current}} It is one of the notable places that had a major role in the country's history during the 1800s and 1900s.

Formerly known as  '''Cavite el Viejo''', it is the location of his home, and the name Kawit is from the word'' kalawit'', the [[Aguinaldo Shrine]], where [[Philippine Declaration of Independence|independence]] from [[Spain]] was declared on June 12, 1898. It is also the birthplace of [[Emilio Aguinaldo]], the first [[List of presidents of the Philippines|president of the Philippines]], who from 1895 to 1897, served as the municipality's chief executive.

Kawit is {{convert|13|km}} from [[Imus]] and  {{convert|23|km}} from [[Manila]].

==Etymology==
The name Kawit is derived from the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word ''kawit'' or ''kalawit'' (hook), which is suggestive of its location at the base of a hook-shaped shoreline along [[Manila Bay]] extending to the tip of [[Cavite City]].

Legend, however, gives another version on how the town got its name. One day, a Spanish visitor asked a native blacksmith about the name of the village. The latter was busy at the time pounding on the anvil a piece of hot metal that looked like a hook. He hesitated to speak, not understanding what the stranger was asking, but when pressed for an answer, and thinking that he wanted to know what he was doing, he merely said ''kawit''. The Spanish left muttering the word ''kawit''. In the course of the time, the word evolved into ''cauite'', and finally ''cavite''.

==History==
[[File:Kawit,Cavitejf1486 11.JPG|thumb|left|Old Kawit Town Hall]]
Kawit was the most thriving settlement prior to the coming of the Spanish. In fact, the town provided the first anchorage of the Spanish in the province, whence colonization and [[proselytization]] of the Christian religion began, spreading to all corners of the province. It was established as a town in 1587 or, as recognized by laws, August 1, 1600.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hrep-website.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/legisdocs/basic_19/HB02869.pdf|title=House Bill No. 2869|date=2022|accessdate=December 31, 2023|publisher=House of Representatives of the Philippines}}</ref><ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=PP|number=287, s. 2023|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2023/07/07/proclamation-no-287-s-2023/|title=Declaring Tuesday, 01 August 2023, a Special (Non-working) Day in the Municipality of Kawit, Province of Cavite|date=July 7, 2023|publisher=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines]]|accessdate=December 31, 2023}}</ref> 

For a long time, the place was called by the Spanish "Cavite el Viejo" or Old Cavite to distinguish it from "Cavite la Punta" or "Cavite el Puerto", the commercial port and naval base (now [[Cavite City]]) whence came many Spanish marines on shore leave who made frequent visits to Cavite el Viejo, eventually turning it into a [[red-light district]]. This seedy reputation of the town was erased when [[Saint Mary Magdalene]] was made [[Patron saint|patroness]], under the spiritual supervision of the [[Jesuits]] as ordered by [[Miguel García Serrano]], [[Order of Saint Augustine|O.S.A.]] (1618–1629), the fifth [[Archbishop of Manila]].

With the establishment in the wake of the [[Philippine Revolution]], the [[Philippine Independent Church]] built a shrine to [[Saint Michael, the Archangel]] in the [[barangay|''barrio'']] of Binakayan in 1902.

Cavite el Viejo was then a big town, comprising the municipality of Kawit today, Cavite la Punta (now Cavite City), [[Noveleta]] (called Tierra Alta by the Spanish), and [[Imus]]. Eventually, these three'' barrios''' populations grew and they eventually seceded to become independent municipalities.

Aside from its role as the birthplace of independence, Kawit was also the site of the [[Battle of Binakayan-Dalahican]], one of several Filipino victories during the Revolution.

In 1907, the town was renamed to Kawit, its present name, by virtue of Act No. 1718 by the [[Philippine Commission]].<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=1718|url=https://jurist.ph/laws/an-act-increasing-the-number-of-municipalities-in-the-province-of-cavite-from-twelve-to-thirteen-by-separating-from-the-present-municipality-of-noveleta-the-former-municipality-of-cavite-viejo-and-giving-to-the-latter-the-territory-which-it-comprised-prior-to-the-passage-of-act-numbered-nine-hundred-and-forty-seven-and-changing-the-name-of-the-municipality-of-cavite-viejo-to-kawit|title=An Act Increasing the Number of Municipalities in the Province of Cavite From Twelve to Thirteen, by Separating from the Present Municipality of Noveleta the Former Municipality of Cavite Viejo and Giving to the Latter the Territory which it Comprised Prior to the Passage of Act Numbered Nine Hundred and Forty-Seven, and Changing the Name of the Municipality of Cavite Viejo to Kawit|date=September 20, 1907|accessdate=December 31, 2023|publisher=Jurist AI}}</ref>

==Culture==

=== Maytinis Festival ===
An original Kawit tradition that takes place every [[Christmas Eve]], a dramatic retelling of the Virgin Mary and Joseph's search in Bethlehem for a place to stay called "Panunuluyan". This reenactment happens on the streets of Kawit with different floats depicting different biblical scenes from Adam and Eve up to Mary and Joseph. The "Panunuluyan" takes place in several houses and is done in singing until it reaches the 400-year-old [[St. Mary Magdalene Church (Kawit)|St. Mary Magdalene Church]], where the Virgin Mary and Joseph are welcomed by angels in a giant ''belen'' (Nativity Scene), which covers the whole main ''[[Retablo]]'' or altarpiece of the church. The songs performed by the angels acted by little girls are mostly in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].

==Government==
[[File:Kawit Municipal Hall (Centennial Road, Kawit, Cavite; 10-14-2022).jpg|thumb|The current Kawit Municipal Hall along [[Antero Soriano Highway]]]]
===Local government===
Like any other Philippine municipality, Kawit is headed by a municipal mayor, vice mayor, and 10 councilors, eight of them elected at large by the voting populace and two of them being sectoral representatives (one for the ''barangays'' and one for the youth, elected respectively through their federations).

The mayor is assisted by the vice mayor, who presides over a [[Sangguniang Bayan|legislative council]]. The current mayor of the historical town is Angelo Emilio G. Aguinaldo, a descendant of the first officially recognized [[President of the Philippines]], General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. The current vice mayor is Edward R. Samala Jr.
