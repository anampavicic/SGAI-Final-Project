'''Chandannagar''' ({{IPA|bn|tʃɔnd̪ɔn.nɔɡoɾ|pron}}), also known by its [[List of renamed places in India|former names]] '''Chandernagore''' and '''Chandernagor''' ({{langx|fr|Chandernagor}}, {{IPA|fr|ʃɑ̃dɛʁ.nagɔʁ|pron}}), is a city in the [[Hooghly district]] in the Indian [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[West Bengal]]. It is headquarter of the [[Chandannagore subdivision]] and part of the area covered by the [[Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority]] (KMDA).

Located on the western bank of [[Hooghly River]], the city was one of the five settlements of [[French India]]. Indo-French architecture is seen in the colonial bungalows, most of which are in a dilapidated state.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/buildings-in-former-french-colony-await-restoration/article26207063.ece|title=Buildings in former French colony await restoration|last=Singh|first=Shiv Sahay|date=7 February 2019|work=The Hindu|access-date=6 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190806154545/https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/buildings-in-former-french-colony-await-restoration/article26207063.ece|archive-date=6 August 2019|url-status=live|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name Chandannagar is composed of two elements, of which the latter, ''nagar,'' means 'city' and the former may be:
* Bengali ''chand'' meaning 'moon', alluding to the shape of the bank of the river [[Hooghly river|Hooghly]].
* Bengali ''chandan'' meaning 'sandalwood'; local tradition holds that the city was once the major hub of the trade of [[sandalwood]].
* ''Chandi'', name of a goddess.

Earlier, the city was known as ''Farasdanga'', from Bengali ''Faras'' 'French' and ''danga'' 'land'.

==History==
[[File:Capture de Chandernagor en 1757 par la Royal Navy.jpg|thumb|The capture of the position of Chandernagore in 1757 by the [[Royal Navy]].]]
[[File:Chandernaggar-Calcuta Map 1900.jpg|thumb|left|Chandannagar and Calcutta 1900.]]
Chandannagar came into being during colonial times, proved conclusively by the fact that no mention of the town is found in medieval Bengali texts like [[Chandimangal]] and [[Manasamangal Kāvya]]. Historians are of the opinion that the French created the town by amalgamating various smaller localities in the area. The three notable villages to be incorporated were Gondolpara to the South, Boro in the North and Khalisani to the West. The name "Chandernagor" can be first found in a letter dated 1696, intended for the officials of the French East India Company, dispatched by [[André-François Deslandes]] and Palle, French officials posted in Chandernagore.

The First Director of the [[French East India Company]], Boureau-Deslandes paid 40,000 coins to the Mughal subahdar in 1688 to gain control of the area and build a factory there. But the first Frenchman to possess any subsequent land holding in this area was Du Plessis who bought land of 13 Arpents at Boro Kishanganj, now located at North Chandannagar for Taka 401 in the year 1673–74.

The prosperity of Chandannagar as a French colony started soon after. At this time the Company establishment consisted of one director, and five members who formed a council, 15 merchants and shopkeepers, two notaries, two padres, two doctors and one [[Sutradhar]]. The army consisted of 130-foot soldiers, 20 among them were native [[Indian people|Indians]]. The Fort d'Orleans was constructed in the year 1696–97 and was better defended than its French and British counterparts. After the initial success the French trade languished due to the lax policy of its Directors.

In 1730 [[Joseph François Dupleix]] was appointed governor of the city, during whose administration more than two thousand brick houses were erected in the town and a considerable maritime trade was carried on.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Chandernagore|volume=5|pages=837–838}}</ref> The population of the city reached to be around a [[lakh]] (100,000) at this time and the fledgling town of [[Calcutta]] was considered to be a poor cousin of Chandannagar. From Dupleix's time to 1756, Chandannagar was the main center for European commerce in Bengal. The city had thriving centres of trade involving [[opium]], [[indigo]], [[silk]], [[rice]], rope, [[sugar]], etc. The fine clothes of Chandannagar were exported to [[Europe]].

One of the premier men of the town who made it big at this time was Indranarayan Chaudhari. He had arrived at the end of the seventeenth century from Jessore as an orphan sheltered at his maternal grandfather's house. He secured a job at the Company out of his own industriousness and then went on to gain a tremendous fortune being associated with the burgeoning trade of the company. When the [[East India Company]] seized his house after the siege of 1756, cash and jewellery worth 65 lakhs was secured from his house alone. Nandadulal Temple, a temple to Krishna established by him still houses the secret chamber in which he reportedly hid his immense fortune which was later recovered by British general [[Robert Clive]]. [[Krishnachandra Roy|Maharaj Krishna Chandra]] of [[Krishnanagar, Nadia|Krishnanagar]] would often come to him to lend money.
[[File:Fiebig Chandernagore Admiralty.jpg|thumb|Chandannagar waterfront c.&nbsp;1850]]
In 1756 war broke out between France and Great Britain, and Colonel [[Robert Clive]] of the [[British East India Company]] and [[Charles Watson (Royal Navy officer)|Admiral Charles Watson]] of the British Navy bombarded and [[Battle of Chandannagar|captured Chandannagar]] on 23 March 1757. The town's fortifications and many houses were demolished thereafter, and Chandannagar's importance as a commercial center was eclipsed by that of [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] situated down river. Chandernagore was restored to the French in 1763, but retaken by the British in 1794 in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The city was returned to France in 1816, along with a {{convert|3|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}  enclave of surrounding territory. It was governed as part of [[French India]] until 1950, under the political control of the governor-general in [[Pondicherry]]. By 1900 the town's former commercial importance was gone, and it was little more than a quiet suburb of Calcutta, with a population of 25,000 (1901). But it was noted for its clean wide thoroughfares, with many elegant residences along the riverbank.<ref name="EB1911"/>

Like the other three French-administered colonies of India, Chandernagore was under the jurisdiction of [[History_of_Puducherry#European_period|French-controlled]] [[Pondicherry]]. There was only one Governor for the entire [[French India]]. He resided in the principal city of Pondicherry, and from time to time, he would visit the other colonies. There was one Administrator under the Governor in each colony. Though there were courts and magistrates here, a separate judge used to come from Pondicherry for session trials. There was a High court in Pondicherry for filing an appeal. The Collectorates, the Education Department, the Housing Department, etc. were all under the said department of Pondicherry. One Inspector from France used to come here every year for inspecting all the affairs. The French Consul who lived in Calcutta had no connection with the administration of Chandernagore.

Formerly the government kept a troop of sepoys to help maintenance of peace in the town. It is known that Chandernagore had two divisions of infantry during 1743–45. Under the terms of the treaty it had no alternative but to keep not more than 15 soldiers.

The laws of this place were not specific, laws were the same in regard to all the French colonies and special decrees were drawn up by the Minister of the Interior of France. In the French parliamentary houses, among the Députés and Senators there was one representative elected by the citizens and representatives of French India in each house.

Though no Indian ever got a place in the [[French Parliament]], the citizens of Chandernagore had the right to be elected to those seats.

A Municipality was created here on 1 August 1880. Charles Dumaine became the first Mayor.

There was a sworn-in post called ''[[Civil law notary|Notaire]]'' like the Registrar of British India. All the deeds such as testaments and wills, sales and purchases, conveyances, debts and dues or prenuptial contracts were registered by him.

The judicial system even passed a few death sentences in the town. The first time this was carried out was on 26 January 1883: two persons named Sk. Abdul Panjari and Hiru Bagdi were sentenced to death. The ''[[guillotine]]'' was used to carry out capital punishment and was used in the town for the last time on 22 July 1895.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/love-heritage-fund-restoration/article22537389.ece|title=Love heritage?

===Merger with India===
{{see|Yanaon#Dates of important events of merger of French India}}
[[File:Chandannagar referendum day 1948.jpg|thumb|Referendum day in June 1948]]
India became independent from Britain in 1947. In June 1948, the French Government held a plebiscite which found that 97% of Chandannagar's residents wished to become part of India. In May 1950, the French allowed the Indian government to assume ''de facto'' control over Chandannagar, officially ceding the city to India on 2 February 1951. ''De jure'' transfer took place on 9 June 1952. The inhabitants were given the option to retain French nationality, like their counterparts in Pondicherry.<ref>{{cite web |title=Treaty to confirm the Cession of Chandernagore |url=https://mea.gov.in/bilateral-documents.htm?dtl/6750/Teaty+to+confirm+the+Cession+of+Chandernagore |website=Ministry of External Affairs |access-date=11 September 2021 |archive-date=11 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210911053428/https://mea.gov.in/bilateral-documents.htm?dtl/6750/Teaty+to+confirm+the+Cession+of+Chandernagore |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 2 October 1954, Chandannagar was integrated into the state of [[West Bengal]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bondyopadhyay|first1=Biswanath|title=Dictionary of Historical Places, Bengal, 1757 – 1947|date=5 April 2024 |publisher=Primus|isbn=978-93-80607-41-2|page=135}}</ref>

===History===
The history of Jagaddhatri Puja in Chandannagar is unknown. The beginning of Jagaddhatri Puja in Krishnanagore was 1762. Indranarayan Choudhury died in 1756. Indranarayan Choudhury by no means introduced the Jagaddhatri puja in Chandannagar. Indranarayan Choudhury performed the Jagaddhatri puja at his own house in Chandannagar, at the time Krishnachandra used to come to borrow money from Indranarayan Choudhury. The father of Krishnachandra had started the puja of Jagaddhatri at Krishna Nagar due to missing out once on the puja of Durga by being locked up in British prison.<ref name="Charleston2004">{{cite book|last=Charleston|first=June McDaniel Associate Professor in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies College of|title=Offering Flowers, Feeding Skulls : Popular Goddess Worship in West Bengal: Popular Goddess Worship in West Bengal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=caeJpIj9SdkC&pg=PA220|date=9 July 2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-534713-5|page=220}}</ref> Once Krishnachandra's ship could not reach Krishna Nagar in time for Jagaddhatri puja due to weak winds. So he performed on day of navami the puja at the Ghat of Nichupatty. Seeing in this the wish of the Goddess to be established as a puja in Chandannagar too, he left funds for its yearly worship on a permanent basis.
In 1780 ''Bengal Gazette'' of James August Hickey was the first newspaper of this country. The newspaper was silent about the Jagaddhatri Puja. But the 'Friends of India' published a report on the community Jagaddhatri Puja in 1820. The date of the community Jagaddhatri Puja in Chandernagore was 1790. In those days Robert Clive called Lakhsmiganj of Chandernagore the 'Granary of Bengal'. The Jagaddhatri Puja at Chaulpatty (Rice Market) in Lakshmiganj is probably the historic example of the ancient community Jagaddhatri Puja. The Jagaddhatri Puja of Chandernagore bridges the past and the present.
