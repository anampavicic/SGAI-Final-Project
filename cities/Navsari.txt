[[File:JNTata.jpg|thumb|[[Jamsetji Tata]], the person behind [[Tata Group]] and a major Parsi businessman from Navsari.]]

The [[Chalukyas of Navasarika]], who governed the area around Navsari as subordinates of the [[Chalukyas of Vatapi]], repulsed an [[Umayyad campaigns in India|Umayyad invasion]] of the area in 738-739 CE.<ref>{{cite book |title=The End of the Jihad State: The Reign of Hisham Ibn 'Abd al-Malik and the Collapse of the Umayyads |author=K.

According to the Parsi tradition, in 1142 A.D., when they first came to Navsari, the city was named Nag Mandal. The Parsis found the city's atmosphere similar to that of the [[Sari, Iran|Sari region of Iran]]. In the Persian language, "now" means new, and "Sari" refers to the region in Iran, hence the name Naoo Sari. Two families of [[Parsi]] [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] priests settled in Navsari in the early 13th century, and the town soon emerged as the main center of the Parsi priesthood and religious authority. As the Parsi community grew at other places in India, the priests from Navsari were sought by the new Parsi settlements throughout the country. It is the home of the Bhagarsath [[Atash Behram]] established in 1765 A.D., which is now a [[World Heritage Site]]. [[Surat]] replaced Navsari as the principal settlement of the Parsi community in the 18th century, following its rise as a major trade center for the European [[factor (agent)|factories]], and the [[Maratha Confederacy|Maratha]] incursions into Surat; Surat itself lost this position to [[Bombay]] in the later years.<ref>{{cite book |author=Jesse S.

The Sayaji Vaibhav Public Library Navsari is an important public building in Navsari.

'''The Meherjirana library.'''

This is one of the oldest libraries in the South Gujarat Region. It was established by the first Dastur (Parsi/Zoroastrian priest) [[Meherji Rana]], who was also born in Navsari. He was invited by Akbar in a religious program organised by the Great Akbar. Leaders of all religious groups participated in it. Akbar asked to start a conversation and eventually asked to give information about their religion. All the religious leaders gave information about their religions and gradually tried to show their religions as great except Dastur Meherjirana. Afterward, the leaders asked Akbar his opinion as to whose religion is great. Akbar was really impressed by Dastur Meherjirana, so he asked him. Meherjirana Dastur calmly replied, "All religions are equal in terms of strength and ideology and principle". Akbar was extremely impressed by his personality. He donated a piece of land to Dastur Meherjirana in Navsari, where today The Meherjirana Library stands. Akbar wrote on a scroll about the donation of land which is still preserved by the management of the library.

'''[[Dandi, Navsari|Dandi]]'''

The [[Dandi, Navsari|Dandi]] seashore is an important location from the point of view of India's Independence Movement. In 1930 Mahatma Gandhi started the "[[Salt March|Dandi March]]" from Sabarmati Ashram up to the Dandi seashore to protest against a tax on salt by the colonial government.

'''Ajmalgadh'''

Though it is surrounded by high hills, this is a historical place. Zoroastrians/Parsis roamed in the forest and cave of Ajmalgadh to save and protect their sacred fire-cauldron for nearly 250–350 years. Recently, the local administration constructed a pillar on the hill of Ajmalgadh describing the story. They also closed the cave which was used to protect the holy fire.

'''The National Salt Satyagraha Memorial, Dandi'''

[[National Salt Satyagraha Memorial|The National Salt Satyagraha Memorial]] in Dandi, Navsari <ref>{{Cite web |title=National Salt Satyagrah Memorial |url=https://nssm.in/ |access-date=27 February 2024 |website=nssm.in}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=National Salt Satyagraha Memorial |url=https://www.gujarattourism.com/south-zone/navsari/national-salt-satygraha-museum---dandi.html |access-date=27 February 2024 |website=gujrattourism |language=en}}</ref> commemorates the historic [[Salt March]] of 1930, led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]].  This peaceful protest was a landmark moment in India's struggle for independence from British rule.  The memorial stands as a testament to Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolent resistance ([[satyagraha]]). It features a poignant statue of Gandhi, 24 narrative murals depicting the march, and solar evaporation ponds where visitors can learn about [[Salt|salt production]]. The memorial aims to inspire visitors while recreating the spirit of the [[Salt March|Dandi March]], a pivotal event that shook the foundations of [[British Raj|British colonial]] power and helped pave the way for [[Indian independence movement|India's freedom]].
