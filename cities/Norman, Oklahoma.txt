'''Norman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɔr|m|ən}}) is the [[List of municipalities in Oklahoma|3rd most populous city]] in the U.S. state of [[Oklahoma]], with a population of 128,026 as of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]].<ref name="QuickFacts: Norman city, Oklahoma">{{Cite web |title=QuickFacts: Norman city, Oklahoma |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/normancityoklahoma |access-date=2023-06-26 |website=United States Census Bureau}}</ref> It is the most populous city and the [[county seat]] of [[Cleveland County, Oklahoma|Cleveland County]] and the second-most populous city in the [[Oklahoma City metropolitan area]] after the state capital, [[Oklahoma City]], 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of Norman.

The city was settled during the [[Land Run of 1889]], which opened the former [[Unassigned Lands]] of [[Indian Territory]] to [[American pioneer]] settlement. It was named in honor of [[Abner Norman]], the area's initial [[land surveyor]], and was formally incorporated on {{nowrap|May 13}}, 1891. Norman has prominent higher education and related research industries, as it is home to the [[University of Oklahoma]], the largest university in the state, with nearly 32,000 students. The university is well known for its sporting events by teams under the banner of the nickname "[[Oklahoma Sooners|Sooners]]", with over 85,000 people routinely attending [[American football|football]] games. The university is home to several museums, including the [[Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art]], which contains the largest collection of [[Impressionism|French Impressionist]] art ever given to an American university, as well as the [[Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History]].

Norman's [[National Weather Center]] (NWC) houses a unique collection of university, state, federal, and private-sector organizations that work together to improve the understanding of events related to the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. Norman lies within [[Tornado Alley]], a geographic region colloquially known for frequent and intense tornadic activity. The [[Storm Prediction Center]] (SPC), a branch of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) that delivers forecasts for severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, and other high-impact hazardous weather in the contiguous United States, is located at the NWC. Additionally, research is conducted at the co-located [[National Severe Storms Laboratory]] (NSSL), which operates various experimental [[weather radar]]s and develops innovative tools, applications, and techniques aimed at improving forecasts and warnings of severe weather.

The Oklahoma region became part of the United States with the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803. Before the [[American Civil War]], the U.S. government began relocating the [[Five Civilized Tribes]]—the five Native American tribes that the United States officially recognized via treaty—to Oklahoma. Treaties of 1832 and 1833 assigned the area known today as Norman to the [[Creek Nation]].<ref name="OU_Press">{{cite book |last=Levy |first=David W. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Wlj-XkxJfUC |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |title=The University of Oklahoma: A History (Volume I) |year=2005 |isbn=9780806137032 |access-date=September 23, 2009}}</ref>

After the Civil War, the [[Creek indians|Creeks]] were accused of aiding the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]; as a result they ceded the region back to the United States in 1866.<ref name="OU_Press" /> In the early 1870s, the federal government undertook a survey of these unassigned lands. Abner Ernest Norman, a 23-year-old surveyor from [[Kentucky]], was hired to oversee part of this project.<ref name="OU_Press" /> Norman's work crew set up camp near what is today the corner of Classen Boulevard and Lindsey Street; it was there that the men, perhaps jokingly, carved a sign on an elm tree that read "Norman's Camp," in honor of their young boss.<ref name="OU_Press" /><ref name="About_Norman">{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.norman.ok.us/content/about-city |publisher=City of Norman |title=About the City |access-date=January 7, 2012 |archive-date=January 3, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103012423/http://www.ci.norman.ok.us/content/about-city |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1887, the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] began service to the area,<ref name="OU_Press" /> which was later opened to settlement as part of the [[Land Run of 1889]];<ref name="OU_Press" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.okgenweb.org/~land/ |publisher=Oklahoma Genealogy Web |title=Oklahoma's Land Runs |access-date=January 13, 2012}}</ref> early settlers decided to keep the name "Norman."<ref name="OU_Press" /><ref name="About_Norman" />

On {{nowrap|April 22}}, 1889, that first Land Run in what would become the state of Oklahoma saw the founding of Norman, with at least 150 residents spending the night in makeshift campsites,<ref name="OU_Press" /> and by the next morning a downtown was already being constructed.<ref name="OU_Press" /> Almost immediately two prominent Norman businessmen, former Purcell railroad freight agent Delbert Larsh and railroad station chief cashier Thomas Waggoner, began lobbying for the territorial government to locate its first university in Norman.<ref name="OU_Press" /> The two were interested in growing the city and had reasoned that, rather than try to influence territorial lawmakers to locate the heavily contested territory capital in Norman, it made sense to attempt to secure the state's first university instead (a move that would be far less controversial).<ref name="OU_Press" /> On {{nowrap|December 19}}, 1890, Larsh and Waggoner were successful with the passage of Territorial Council Bill 114, establishing the [[University of Oklahoma]] in Norman about 18 years before Oklahoma statehood.<ref name="OU_Press" />

The City of Norman was formally incorporated on {{nowrap|May 13}}, 1891.<ref name="Norman_Incorporated">{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.norman.ok.us/content/city-government |publisher=City of Norman |title=Norman: Our History |access-date=October 2, 2010 |archive-date=October 5, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101005064717/http://www.ci.norman.ok.us/content/city-government |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Norman has grown throughout the decades. By 1902 the downtown district contained two banks, two hotels, a flour mill, and other businesses; by 1913 over 3,700 people lived in Norman when the [[Oklahoma Railway Company]] decided to extend its [[interurban]] [[streetcar]] running from Oklahoma City to [[Moore, Oklahoma|Moore]] into Norman, spurring additional population growth.<ref name="odell">{{cite web |last=O'Dell |first=Larry |title=Norman |url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=NO006 |publisher=Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History |access-date=July 27, 2013}}</ref> The rail lines eventually transitioned to freight during the 1940s as the [[United States Numbered Highway]] system developed.

===Military in Norman===
In 1941, the [[University of Oklahoma]] and Norman city officials established Max Westheimer Field, a university airstrip, and then leased it to the [[U.S. Navy]] as a Naval Flight Training Center in 1942.<ref name="odell" /> It became the [[Naval Air Station Norman]], and it was used for training combat pilots during [[World War II]]. A second training center, known as Naval Air Technical Training Center, and a naval hospital were later established to the south.<ref name="odell"/> In the years following World War II the airstrip was transferred back to the university's control.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rv-9.com/maxwf.html |publisher=rv-9.com |title=Max Westheimer Field |access-date=August 1, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227075729/http://www.rv-9.com/maxwf.html |archive-date=December 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Today the airstrip is called the [[University of Oklahoma Westheimer Airport]]. Following the war the remaining military presence and post-war veterans who came to Norman to get an education again grew the city's population, which was 27,006 by 1950.<ref name="odell"/><ref name="Decennials" /> The Navy again utilized the bases in a lesser capacity from 1952 to 1959 in support of the [[Korean War]] effort.<ref name="odell"/>
