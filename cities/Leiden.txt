The [[Statistics Netherlands|Netherlands Central Bureau of Statistics]] (CBS) further includes [[Katwijk]] in the agglomeration which makes the total population of the Leiden urban agglomeration 282,207 and in the larger Leiden urban area also [[Teylingen]], [[Noordwijk]], and [[Noordwijkerhout]] are included with in total 365,913 inhabitants. Leiden is located on the [[Oude Rijn (Utrecht and South Holland)|Oude Rijn]], at a distance of some {{cvt|20|km|0|abbr=off}} from [[The Hague]] to its south and some {{cvt|40|km|0}} from [[Amsterdam]] to its north. The recreational area of the Kaag Lakes ([[Kagerplassen]]) lies just to the northeast of Leiden.

A [[University town|university city]] since 1575, Leiden has been one of [[Europe]]'s most prominent scientific centres for more than four centuries. Leiden is a typical [[University town|university city]], university buildings are scattered throughout the city and the many students from all over the world give the city a bustling, vivid and international atmosphere. Many important scientific discoveries have been made here, giving rise to Leiden's motto: 'City of Discoveries'. The city houses [[Leiden University]], the oldest university of the Netherlands, and [[Leiden University Medical Center]]. Leiden University is one of Europe's top universities, with thirteen Nobel Prize winners. It is a member of the League of European Research Universities and positioned highly in all international academic rankings. It is twinned with [[Oxford]], the location of the United Kingdom's oldest [[University of Oxford|university]]. Leiden University and [[Leiden University of Applied Sciences]] (''Leidse Hogeschool'') together have around 35,000 students. Modern scientific medical research and teaching started in the early 18th century in Leiden with Boerhaave.

Leiden is a city with a rich cultural heritage, not only in science, but also in the arts. One of the world's most famous painters, [[Rembrandt]], was born and educated in Leiden. Other Leiden painters include [[Lucas van Leyden]], [[Jan van Goyen]] and [[Jan Steen]].

== History ==

Leiden was formed on an artificial hill (today called the [[Burcht van Leiden]]) at the confluence of the rivers [[Oude Rijn (Utrecht and South Holland)|Oude]] and Nieuwe Rijn (Old and New Rhine). The settlement was called ''Leithon''. The name is from Germanic *''leitha'' (canal).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Leyden+jar&allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=11 August 2015 |archive-date=6 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906102136/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=Leyden+jar&allowed_in_frame=0 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Leiden has erroneously been associated with the Roman outpost [[Brittenburg|Lugdunum Batavorum]]. This was thought to be located at the Burcht of Leiden, and the city's name was thought to be derived from the Latin name Lugdunum. However, the ''castellum'' was in fact closer to the town of [[Katwijk]], whereas the Roman settlement near Leiden was called [[Matilo]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Jona Lendering |url=https://www.livius.org/ga-gh/germania/lugdunum.html |title=Towns in Germania Inferior: Lugdunum (Brittenburg) |publisher=Livius.org |access-date=11 June 2010 |archive-date=24 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524104914/http://www.livius.org/ga-gh/germania/lugdunum.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Siege of 1420 ===

In 1420, during the [[Hook and Cod wars]], [[John III, Duke of Bavaria|Duke John III of Bavaria]] along with his army marched from [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]] in the direction of Leiden in order to conquer the city since Leiden did not pay the new [[Count of Holland]] [[Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut]], his niece and only daughter of [[William II, Duke of Bavaria-Straubing|Count William VI of Holland]].

Burgrave Filips of Wassenaar and the other local noblemen of the Hook faction assumed that the duke would besiege Leiden first and send small units out to conquer the surrounding citadels. But [[John of Bavaria-Straubing|John of Bavaria]] chose to attack the citadels first.

He rolled the cannons along with his army but one which was too heavy went by ship. By firing at the walls and gates with iron balls the citadels fell one by one. Within a week John of Bavaria conquered the castles of Poelgeest, Ter Does, Hoichmade, de Zijl, ter Waerd, Warmond and de Paddenpoel.

On 24 June the army appeared before the walls of Leiden. On 17 August 1420, after a two-month siege, the city surrendered to John of Bavaria. The burgrave Filips of Wassenaar was stripped of his offices and rights and lived out his last years in captivity.

=== 16th to 18th centuries ===

Leiden flourished in the 16th and 17th century. At the close of the 15th century, the weaving establishments of Leiden (mainly [[broadcloth]]) were very important. In the same period, Leiden developed an important printing and publishing industry. Printers [[Lucas van Leyden]] and [[Otto van Veen]] lived here, and so did [[Christoffel Plantijn]]. One of Christoffel's pupils was [[Lodewijk Elzevir]] (1547–1617), who established the largest bookshop and printing works in Leiden, a business continued by [[House of Elzevir|his descendants]] through 1712.

In 1572, the city sided with the [[Dutch Revolt]] against Spanish rule and played an important role in the [[Eighty Years' War]]. It was [[Siege of Leiden|besieged]] from May to October 1574 by the Spanish but was relieved by the cutting of the dikes, thus enabling ships to carry provisions to the inhabitants. [[William I of Orange]] founded the [[University of Leiden]] in 1575 as a reward for their heroic defense. The end of the siege is still celebrated in Leiden on October 3 each year. According to tradition, the citizens of Leiden were offered the choice between a university and a certain exemption from taxes and chose the university. The siege is notable also for being the first instance in Europe of the issuance of paper money, with paper taken from prayer books being stamped using coin dies when silver ran out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecurrencycollector.com/pdfs/Siege_Notes_-_Windows_to_the_Past_Part_I.pdf |title=Siege Notes - Windows To The Past |author=John E.

Leiden prospered in the 17th century, in part because of the impetus to the textile industry by refugees from [[Flanders]]. The city had lost about a third of its 15,000 citizens during the siege of 1574, but it quickly recovered to 45,000 in 1622 and may have come near to 70,000 {{Circa|1670}}. During the Dutch Golden Era, Leiden was the second largest city of Holland after Amsterdam.<ref>{{cite book |title=Geschiedenis van Nederland. Van de Opastand tot het Heden. |publisher=Boom Amsterdam |date=2017 |page=96 |edition=4th}}</ref> It played a crucial role in the establishment of modern chemistry and medicine due to the work by [[Herman Boerhaave]] (1668–1738).

Leiden slumped from the late 17th century on, mainly due to the decline of the textile industries. The baize manufacture was given up at the beginning of the 19th century, although industry remained central to Leiden economy. This decline can be seen in the fall in population, which had sunk to 30,000 between 1796 and 1811, and in 1904 was 56,044.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://vanosnabrugge.org/leiden.htm |title=Van Osnabrugge, Osenbruggen, Ossenbruch etc. Genealogy |access-date=18 September 2020 |archive-date=18 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210418085928/http://vanosnabrugge.org/leiden.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Leiden was the publishing place from the 17th to the early 19th century of the important journal ''[[Nouvelles Extraordinaires de Divers Endroits]]'', known also as ''Gazette de Leyde''.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100306730 |title=News and Politics in the Age of Revolution: Jean Luzac's "Gazette de Leyde" |last=Popkin |first=Jeremy D. |date=1989-10-01 |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=9781501700712 |location=Ithaca, NY |access-date=20 February 2019 |archive-date=21 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190221112010/http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100306730 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== 19th and 20th centuries ===

On 12 January 1807, a [[Leiden gunpowder disaster|catastrophe]] struck the city when a boat loaded with {{cvt|17400|kg|0|abbr=off}} of gunpowder blew up in the middle of Leiden. 151 people were killed, over 2,000 were injured and some 220 homes were destroyed. King [[Louis Bonaparte]] personally visited the city to provide assistance to the victims. Although located in the centre of the city, the area destroyed remained empty for many years. In 1886 the space was turned into a public park, the Van der Werff park.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.amazing-holland.nl/assets/leiden-english.pdf |title=Leiden |website=Amazing Holland |access-date=31 December 2018 |archive-date=31 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181231092354/http://www.amazing-holland.nl/assets/leiden-english.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1842, the railroad from Leiden to [[Haarlem]] was inaugurated and one year later the railway to [[The Hague]] (Den Haag) was completed, resulting in some social and economic improvement. Perhaps the most important piece of Dutch history contributed by Leiden was the [[Constitution of the Netherlands]]. [[Johan Rudolf Thorbecke]] (1798–1872) wrote the Dutch Constitution in April 1848 in his house at Garenmarkt 9 in Leiden.

Leiden's reputation as the "city of books" continued through the 19th century with the establishment of publishing dynasties by [[Evert Jan Brill]] and [[Albertus Willem Sijthoff]].<ref name="BN-History">{{cite web |url=http://www.b-n.nl/new_index.php?page=history |title=History: Leiden, city of books |publisher=Burgersdijk & Niermans |access-date=29 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017011232/http://www.b-n.nl/new_index.php?page=history |archive-date=17 October 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Sijthoff, who rose to prominence in the trade of translated books, wrote a letter in 1899 to [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]] regarding his opposition to becoming a signatory to the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]]. He felt that international copyright restrictions would stifle the Dutch publishing industry.<ref name="Publishers-Circular-1899">{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGtNAAAAYAAJ&q=Albertus+Willem+Sijthoff&pg=PA597 |title=The Netherlands and the Berne Convention |page=597 |work=The Publishers' circular and booksellers' record of British and foreign literature, Vol. 71 |publisher=Sampson Low, Marston & Co. |access-date=29 August 2010 |year=1899 |archive-date=18 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210418074653/https://books.google.com/books?id=IGtNAAAAYAAJ&q=Albertus+Willem+Sijthoff&pg=PA597 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Leiden began to expand beyond its 17th-century moats around 1896 and the number of citizens surpassed 50,000 in 1900. After 1920, new industries were established in the city, such as the [[canning]] and metal industries. During [[World War II]], Leiden was hit hard by Allied bombardments. The areas surrounding the railway station and Marewijk were almost completely destroyed.

The University of Leiden is famous for its many discoveries including [[Snell's law]] (by [[Willebrord Snellius]]) and
the famous [[Leyden jar]], a capacitor made from a glass jar, invented in Leiden by [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]] in 1746. Another development was in [[cryogenics]]: [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] (1913 [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel prize winner in physics]]) liquefied [[helium]] for the first time (1908) and later managed to reach a temperature of less than one degree above the [[absolute zero|absolute minimum]]. [[Albert Einstein]] also spent some time at Leiden University during his early to middle career.

=== Leiden today ===

The city's biggest and most popular annual festival is celebrated on 3 October and is called simply [[3 October Festival|3 Oktober]]. The people of Leiden celebrate the end of the Spanish siege of 1574.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NPQ7-CqG3kUC&q=leiden+oktober+3&pg=PA315 |title=Film & Television Coll Europe |publisher=Routledge |year=2012 |page=315 |isbn=978-1-135-10295-1 |access-date=14 November 2020 |archive-date=16 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210416072941/https://books.google.com/books?id=NPQ7-CqG3kUC&q=leiden+oktober+3&pg=PA315 |url-status=live }}</ref> It typically takes place over the course of two to three days and includes parades, a [[hutspot]] feast, historical reenactments, a funfair and other events. Since 2006, the city has also hosted the annual [[Leiden International Film Festival]].<ref name="dawson">{{cite magazine |url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/76384-leiden-international-film-festival-announces-new-us-indie-competition/ |title=Leiden International Film Festival Announces New US Indie Competition |first=Nick |last=Dawson |magazine=Filmmaker Magazine |date=28 September 2013 |access-date=8 October 2013 |archive-date=2 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002064451/http://filmmakermagazine.com/76384-leiden-international-film-festival-announces-new-us-indie-competition/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Leiden has important functions as a shopping and trade centre for communities around the city.

The city also houses the [[Eurotransplant]], the international organization responsible for the mediation and allocation of [[organ donation]] procedures in Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Slovenia.  Leiden also houses the headquarters of [[Airbus]], a global pan-European aerospace and defence corporation and a leading defence and military contractor worldwide. The group includes [[Airbus]], the leading manufacturer of commercial aircraft worldwide.

== Rivers, canals and parks ==
[[File:Leiden Academisch gebouw en Nonnenbrug.jpg|thumb|left|Leiden Academic Building and Nonnenbrug]]
The two branches of the [[Oude Rijn (Utrecht and South Holland)|Oude Rijn]], which enter Leiden on the east, unite in the centre of the city. The city is further intersected by numerous small [[canal]]s with tree-bordered [[quay]]s. On the west side of the city, the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden|Hortus Botanicus]] and other gardens extend along the old ''[[Singel]]'', or outer canal.  The [[Leidse Hout]] park, which contains a small deer park, lies on the northwest border with [[Oegstgeest]]. The ''Van der Werf Park'' is named after the mayor {{Interlanguage link|Pieter Adriaansz. van der Werff|nl}}, who defended the city against the Spaniards in 1574. The city was beleaguered for months and many died from famine. The open space for the park was formed by the [[Leiden Gunpowder Disaster|accidental explosion]] of a ship loaded with [[gunpowder]] in 1807, which destroyed hundreds of houses, including that of the Elsevier family of [[Printer (publisher)|printers]].



== Buildings of interest ==

Because of the economic decline from the end of the 17th until the middle of the 19th century, much of the 16th- and 17th-century city centre is still intact. It is the second largest 17th-century town centre in the Netherlands, the largest being Amsterdam's city centre.

A hundred buildings in the centre are decorated with large murals of poetry, part of a [[Wall poems in Leiden|wall poem project]] active from 1992, and still ongoing.<ref>{{citation |contribution=Poetry on the Wall |first=Stephan |last=Fihn |page=59 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s_BRStSsWgIC&pg=PA59 |title=Another Word A Day: An All-new Romp Through Some Of The Most Unusual And Intriguing Words In English |editor-first=Anu |editor-last=Garg |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-471-71845-1 |access-date=28 November 2015 |archive-date=11 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511030502/https://books.google.com/books?id=s_BRStSsWgIC&pg=PA59 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{citation |title=Leiden, the Dutch city of poems |first=Ida Indawati |last=Khouw |journal=[[Jakarta Post]] |date=15 July 2001 |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2001/07/14/leiden-dutch-city-poems.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425112224/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2001/07/14/leiden-dutch-city-poems.html |archive-date=25 April 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Fortifications ===

At the strategically important junction of the two arms of the Oude Rijn stands the old [[castle]] ''de Burcht'', a circular tower built on an earthen mound. The mound probably was a refuge against high water before a small wooden fortress was built on top of it in the 11th century. The citadel is a so-called [[motte-and-bailey]] castle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitleiden.nl/en/discover-leiden/specials/top-10-best-spots |title=10 Best Spots in Leiden |date=18 March 2016 |publisher=visitleiden.nl |access-date=18 March 2016 |archive-date=26 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326103048/http://www.visitleiden.nl/en/discover-leiden/specials/top-10-best-spots |url-status=live }}</ref> Of Leiden's old [[city gate]]s only two are left, the ''[[Zijlpoort (Leiden)|Zijlpoort]]'' and the ''Morspoort'',<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.holland.com/global/tourism/destinations/more-destinations/leiden/morspoort-city-gate.htm |title=Morspoort city gate |date=4 March 2013 |access-date=21 April 2019 |archive-date=21 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421185159/https://www.holland.com/global/tourism/destinations/more-destinations/leiden/morspoort-city-gate.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> both dating from the end of the 17th century. Apart from one small watch tower on the Singel nothing is left of the town's [[city wall]]s. Another former [[fortification]] is the ''Gravensteen''. Built as a [[fortress]] in the 13th century it has since served as house, library and prison.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.visitleiden.nl/en/see-do/experience/walking-and-cycling/walking/the-leiden-loop/13-gravensteen |title=13.

</gallery>

The chief of Leiden's numerous churches are the [[Hooglandse Kerk]] (or the church of [[Pancras of Rome|St Pancras]], built in the 15th century and containing a monument to Pieter Adriaansz. van der Werff) and the ''[[Pieterskerk, Leiden|Pieterskerk]]'' (church of [[St Peter]] (1315)) with monuments to [[Joseph Justus Scaliger|Scaliger]], [[Boerhaave]] and other famous scholars. From a historical perspective the [[Marekerk]] is interesting too. [[Arent van 's Gravesande]] designed that church in 1639. Other fine examples of his work in Leiden are in the ''[[Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal]]'' (the municipal museum of fine arts), and the ''[[Leiden University Library#Bibliotheca Thysiana|Bibliotheca Thysiana]]''. The growing city needed another church and the [[Marekerk]] was the first Protestant church to be built in Leiden (and in Holland) after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. It is an example of [[Classicism|Dutch Classicism]]. In the drawings by Van 's Gravesande the [[pulpit]] is the centrepiece of the church. The pulpit is modelled after the one in the ''[[Nieuwe Kerk (Haarlem)|Nieuwe Kerk]]'' at Haarlem (designed by [[Jacob van Campen]]). The building was first used in 1650, and is still in use. The [[Heilige Lodewijkkerk]] is first catholic church in Leiden that was built after the Reformation. This church was given to the Catholics after the gunpowder explosion in 1807, which killed 150 inhabitants and destroyed a large part of the city centre.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lodewijkparochie.nl/kerk/katholiek-kerk-leiden |title=Historie Kerk |language=nl |work=lodewijkparochie.nl |access-date=9 June 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222111709/http://www.lodewijkparochie.nl/kerk/katholiek-kerk-leiden |archive-date=22 December 2015}}</ref><ref>Hein van Woerden (eindred.): Lodewijk in Leiden. Geschiedenis van kerk en orgel. Leiden, Parochie van de Heilige Lodewijk, 2005.</ref> The 'Waalse Kerk' (Breestraat 63) was originally part of the Katharina Hospital. In 1584 it became the church of Protestant refugees from the Southern Netherlands (Brugge) and France. Later churches in the centre include the [[St. Joseph, Leiden|St. Joseph]] in [[expressionism|expressionistic]] style.

=== University buildings ===
[[File:Leiden-Sterrewacht-2013-d.jpg|thumb|The 1860 [[Leiden Observatory]], after restoration (2013)]]
[[File:Hortus botanicus Leiden.jpg|thumb|botanical gardens]]
The city centre contains many buildings that are in use by the [[University of Leiden]]. The ''Academy Building'' is housed in a former 16th-century [[convent]]. Among the institutions connected with the university are the national institution for East Indian languages, [[ethnology]] and [[geography]]; the botanical gardens, founded in 1587; the [[Leiden Observatory|observatory]] (1860); the museum of antiquities (''[[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]]''); and the [[ethnography|ethnographical]] museum, of which [[Philipp Franz von Siebold|P.{{nbsp}}F. von Siebold's]] Japanese collection was the nucleus (''[[National Museum of Ethnology (Netherlands)|Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde]]''). This collection is now housed in a separate museum called the ''[[SieboldHuis]]''. The Bibliotheca Thysiana occupies an old [[Renaissance]] building of the year 1655. It is especially rich in legal works and [[vernacular]] chronicles. Noteworthy are also the many special collections at [[Leiden University Library]] among which those of the [[Society of Dutch Literature]] (1766) and the collection of casts and engravings. In recent years the university has built the [[Leiden Bio Science Park]] at the city's outskirts to accommodate the Science departments. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}


=== Other buildings ===

*'''Stadhuis''' (City Hall), a 16th-century building that was badly damaged by a fire in 1929 but has its Renaissance façade designed by [[Lieven de Key]] still standing
*'''[[Gemeenlandshuis van Rijnland]]''' (1596, restored in 1878)
*'''[[Weigh House (Leiden)|De Waag]]''' (English: [[weigh house]]), built by [[Pieter Post]]
*'''Gravensteen''' – a former 15th century jail at the ''Gerecht'' square (former court-house) 
*'''[[Stedelijk Gymnasium Leiden|Stedelijk Gymnasium]]''' (aka Latijnse School) – the old [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] (1599)
*'''[[Holy Spirit Orphanage|Heilige Geest Weeshuis]]''' (a former ''Holy Spirit Orphanage'') – a complex of 16th century buildings.
*'''[[Museum De Valk|Molen de Valk]]''' – a corn-grinding windmill, now home to a museum (1743)
*'''Pesthuis''', which was built during 1657–1661 at that time just outside the city for curing patients suffering the [[bubonic plague]]. However, after it was built the feared disease did not occur in the Netherlands anymore so it was never used for its original purpose. The building has been used as a military hospital, prison, national asylum and army museum. Until 2019, it served as the entrance of [[Naturalis]]. This museum, one of the largest [[natural history]] museums in the world, was recently renovated and is a building of interest in itself.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.saatchigallery.com/museums/museum-profile/Naturalis+%25E2%2580%2593+National+Museum+Of+Natural+History/2575.html |title=Naturalis – National Museum of Natural History :: The Saatchi Gallery |last=Gallery |first=Saatchi |website=www.saatchigallery.com |access-date=22 March 2016 |archive-date=2 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202000200/http://www.saatchigallery.com/museums/museum-profile/Naturalis+%25E2%2580%2593+National+Museum+Of+Natural+History/2575.html |url-status=live }}</ref>
*'''Stadstimmerwerf''' – the city carpenter's yard or construction yard (1612), built by Lieven de Key ({{circa|1560}}–1627). The former residence of the city's master carpenter is open to the public and is in use as an art gallery of a local visual artists collective.

== Miscellaneous ==
*The coat of arms of Leiden is two red keys, crossed in an X-shape on a white background. These keys are the [[Keys of Heaven]] held by St. Peter, for whom a large church in the city centre is named. Because of this coat of arms, Leiden is referred to as the ''"Sleutelstad"'' ("the key city").<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://orientationweek.org/description-and-enrollment/leiden/ |title=Leiden Information |access-date=5 February 2015 |website=Orientation Week |archive-date=5 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205161752/http://orientationweek.org/description-and-enrollment/leiden/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
*For a time Leiden held the title "The Coldest Place on Earth" because of the developments in [[cryogenics]] in a laboratory there. [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] (1913 [[Nobel prize]] winner in physics) liquefied [[helium]] for the first time (1908), and later managed to reach a temperature of less than one degree above [[Absolute zero]].
*The Norwegian cheese "[[nøkkelost]]" ("key cheese") is named after the keys in coat of arms of Leyden, as it is a variation of [[Leyden cheese]].
