'''Campeche''' ({{IPA|es|kamˈpetʃe|-|Campechepronuciation.ogg}}; {{langx|yua|Kaampech}} {{IPA-myn|ˈkàːmpetʃ|}}), officially the '''Free and Sovereign State of Campeche''' ({{langx|es|Estado Libre y Soberano de Campeche}}), is one of the 31 states which, with [[Mexico City]], make up the [[Administrative divisions of Mexico|32 federal entities]] of [[Mexico]]. Located in southeast Mexico, it is bordered by the states of [[Tabasco]] to the southwest, [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] to the northeast, [[Quintana Roo]] to the east, by the [[Petén (department)|Petén]] department of [[Guatemala]] to the south, and by the [[Orange Walk District]] of [[Belize]] to the southeast. It has a coastline to the west with the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The state capital, also called [[Campeche City|Campeche]], was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1997. The formation of the state began with the city, which was founded in 1540 as the Spanish began the conquest of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. The city was a rich and important port during the colonial period, but declined after [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexico's independence]]. Campeche was part of the province of Yucatán, but split off in the mid-19th century, mostly due to political friction with the city of [[Mérida, Yucatán|Mérida]]. Much of the state's recent economic revival is due to the discovery of petroleum offshore in the 1970s, which has made the coastal cities of Campeche and [[Ciudad del Carmen]] important economic centers. The state has important [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] and colonial sites; however, these are not as well-known or visited as much as others in the Yucatán.

The state's executive power rests in the [[governor of Campeche]] and the legislative power rests in the [[Congress of Campeche]], which is a unicameral legislature composed of 35 deputies.

==Etymology==
The name Campeche is derived from [[Can Pech]], the [[Yucatec Maya language|Maya]] name of a chiefdom of the southwestern Yucatán Peninsula that existed at the time of the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the sixteenth century. The capital city of the chiefdom of Can Pech was called "Ah-Kin-Pech", where the city of Campeche is now. When the Spanish first arrived to the area in 1517, they called it Lazaro, since "the day of our landing was [[Lazarus of Bethany|St. Lazarus' Sunday]]".<ref name=Diaz>Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140441239 }}</ref>{{rp|20}} The native name means "place of snakes and ticks".<ref name="alisauriches">{{cite journal |last=Alisau |first=Patricia |date=March 2003 |title=The riches of Campeche |journal=Business Mexico |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=50–53 }}</ref><ref name="nomenclatura">{{cite web |url=http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_campeche |title=Nomenclatura |year=2010 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios y Delegaciones de México- Campeche |publisher=Instituto para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal and Secretaría de Gobernación |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Nomenclature |access-date=December 9, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=March 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Geography==
Campeche is a relatively flat area of Mexico with {{convert|523|km||abbr=on}} of shoreline on the [[Gulf of Mexico]].<ref name="actecon">{{cite web |url=http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_campeche |title=Actividad Económica |year=2010 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios y Delegaciones de México- Campeche |publisher=Instituto para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal and Secretaría de Gobernación |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Economic activity |access-date=December 9, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=March 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Most of the surface is of sedimentary rock, much of it of marine origin. The area with the highest elevations is near the borders with Guatemala and Quintana Roo. Notable elevations include Cerro Champerico, Cerro los Chinos, Cerro El Ramonal, Cerro El Doce, and Cerro El Gavilán. However, these hills are separated by large expanses of lower flat land. In the south of the municipality of Champotón begin a series of rolling hills known as the Sierra Alta or Puuc, which extend northeast to [[Bolonchén, Campeche|Bolonchen]] and then into the state of Yucatán. These have only an average altitude of between {{convert|40 and 60|m||spell=in}} with some reaching {{convert|100|m|}}. Other areas of these rolling hills lie near the city of Campeche, the main ones known as Maxtum, Boxol and El Morro. Another set is called the Sierra Seybaplaya in the center of the state.

Rainforest areas subdivide into a number of types which include perennial tall tree rainforest, semi perennial tall tree rainforest, deciduous medium height tree rainforest, semi-deciduous medium height tree rainforest, deciduous low height tree rainforest and semi-perennial low height tree rainforest. Away from the coast, these rainforests are interspersed with savannah areas and along the coast are accompanied by areas with sand dunes, [[mangrove]] [[wetland]]s and [[estuary|estuaries]]. Species that can be found in the various rainforests include Spanish cedar (''[[Cedrela odorata]]''), oxhorn bucida (''[[Bucida buceras]]''), Campeche logwood (''[[Haematoxylum campechianum]]''), and wild tamarind (''[[Lysiloma latisiliquum]]''). It also includes a number of precious tropical hardwoods such as red cedar (''[[Toona ciliata]]'') Honduran mahogany (''[[Swietenia macrophylla]]''), ziricote (''[[Cordia dodecandra]]'') and Hollywood (''[[Guaiacum sanctum]]''). Along the coastal areas, palms dominate such as the coconut tree (''[[Coconut|Cocos nucifera]]'') and royal palm (''[[Roystonea regia]]''). The main wildlife species in the state are the jaguar, ocelot, puma, deer, [[collared peccary]], raccoon, hare, [[ring-tailed cat]] and [[Yucatan spider monkey]]. There are many bird species including the [[plain chachalaca]], quail, pelican, and toucan. Reptiles include rattlesnakes, coral snakes, boa constrictors, various species of sea and land turtles, iguanas, and crocodiles. While still rich in wildlife, much has been decimated because of agriculture and exploitation of forest resources destroying habitat as well as uncontrolled hunting. Most of the state's aquatic life — including many species of fish, crustaceans, and mollusks — is found in the [[Bay of Campeche]]. Many of these are exploited commercially.

Most of the state's surface freshwater is in the south and southwest, with rivers, small lakes and estuaries. These diminish in the north where rainfall rapidly filtrates into the subsoil. The rivers in the south and southwest belong to various basins, with the largest being the [[Grijalva River|Grijalva]] to which the [[Candelaria River|Candelaria]], Chumpán and Mamantal Rivers belong. The -[[Usumacinta River|Usumacinta]] also flows in the state but it tends to change course frequently and occasionally divides into branches. The east branch of this river is also called the Palizada River, which has the largest volume although it is narrow. The San Pedro River is another branch of the Usumacinta, which passes by [[Jonuta Municipality]] in Tabasco before emptying in the Gulf of Mexico. The Chumpán River is an isolated river formed by the union of various streams. It runs north–south and empties in the Laguna de Terminos. The Candelaria River forms in Petén, Guatemala and runs north–south and empties into the Laguna de Pargos. The Mamantel River empties into the Laguna de Panlau. The Champotón River is in the center of the state and empties into the Gulf of Mexico. The rest of the state's streams flow only in the rainy season.

The [[Laguna de Términos]] lagoon is located in the southwest of the state, near the border with [[Tabasco]]. It is separated from the Gulf of Mexico only by the [[Ciudad del Carmen|Isla del Carmen]]. It receives freshwater from most of Campeche's rivers as well as saltwater from the Gulf of Mexico. In these brackish waters have developed a number of aquatic species such as sea bass, small sharks, crabs, oysters, turtles, and storks.<ref name="regionalizacion">{{cite web |url=http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_campeche |title=Regionalización |year=2010 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios y Delegaciones de México- Campeche |publisher=Instituto para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal and Secretaría de Gobernación |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Regions |access-date=December 9, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=March 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The lagoon is ringed by smaller lakes and forms the most important lake-lagoon system in the country. These lakes include Atasta, Pom, Puerto Rico, El Este, Del Vapor, Del Corte, Pargos and Panlau. This system formed about five thousand years ago by the accumulation of sediment carried by surrounding rivers. This system connects to the Sabancuy estuary to the northeast.

Campeche is in the tropics; it has a humid climate, with a defined rainy season, and a relatively dry season from late winter to early spring. Average annual rainfall varies between {{convert|900 and 2000|mm||abbr=on}}. The hottest and most humid areas of the state are along the coast between the Laguna de Términos and the northern border. Average annual temperature is {{convert|26|C|}} with highs up to {{convert|36|C|}} in the summer and lows of {{convert|17|C|}} in the winter. Prevailing winds are from the northwest from November to March, from the north between September and October, from the southeast from June to August and from the south in April and May. In the winter, storms from the north called "nortes" can bring colder dry air from the area of the United States. In the late summer, there are sometimes hurricanes.

The state has a number of ecosystems, from rainforest, to [[savanna]] to coast and sea. Environmentally, the state is divided into four major regions. The coastal region consists of the entire coastline of the state and a strip of shallow water just offshore called the [[Sonda de Campeche]] with coral reefs and low islands called [[cay]]s. The region has large expanses of mangroves that dominate the swamps. Non-swamp areas are dominated by palm trees. Wildlife is dominated by bird and reptile species such as storks, pelicans, ducks, seagulls, lizards, turtles and water snakes. The mountain region is in the north and east of the state consisting of two chains of low hills called the Dzibalchen and Sierra Alta. It also includes the savannah area and an area called Los Chenes, where natural wells (called ''[[cenote]]s'') are common. This area is noted for its tropical hardwoods and the [[chicle|chicle or gum tree]]. Wildlife includes deer, armadillos, rabbits, quail, and woodpeckers. The rainforest region is located on the center and south of the state with a wide variety of trees including tropical hardwoods such as mahogany. Many of the plants used in the state's cuisine such as ''[[Annatto|achiote]]'' and tropical fruits are from here. The river region is located in the southwest of the state, named after the various rivers that flow here, mostly emptying into the Laguna de Términos. It has the hottest and most humid climate in Campeche with wildlife and vegetation similar to that found in both the Rainforest and Coast regions.<ref name="regionalizacion"/>

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Campeche, Campeche}}
[[File:Calakmul2.jpg|thumb|left|View of one of the [[Maya architecture|Maya pyramids]] at [[Calakmul]]]]

The first people to dominate the area were the [[Maya peoples|Maya]], who arrived to Campeche from [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]] and [[Chiapas]]. The main Mayan cities in Campeche were [[Edzna|Edzná]], [[Xtampak]], and later [[Calakmul]] and [[Becan|Becán]]. The [[Maya civilization]] reached its height between 600 AD and 900 AD. From 1000 AD on, the Maya cities collapsed and were abandoned for unknown reasons. This led to the establishment of smaller settlements and a mixing of the Maya and [[Chontal Maya|Chontal people]] in the south of the state, which had commercial ties to the central highland cultures of Mexico. From the 11th century to the 16th century, Campeche was divided into smaller dominions.<ref name="enchis">{{cite web |url=http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_campeche |title=Historia |year=2010 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios y Delegaciones de México- Campeche |publisher=Instituto para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal and Secretaría de Gobernación |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=History |access-date=December 9, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=March 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

The first Spaniards in the area were [[Francisco Hernández de Córdoba (Yucatán conquistador)|Francisco Hernández de Córdoba]] and Antón de Alaminos in 1517, who landed at a settlement called Can-Pech, part of the Sol Garrapata dominion. He renamed it San Lázaro. He moved onto the territory of Chakanputon (today [[Champotón, Campeche|Champotón]]) where he and his men [[Francisco_Hernández_de_Córdoba_(Yucatán_conquistador)#Champotón–Potonchán,_and_the_%22Coast_of_the_Evil_Battle%22|were attacked]] by the warriors of this dominion. Hernandez de Cordoba died of his wounds from this battle, prompting the Spanish to call this bay the "Bahía de Mala Pelea" (Bay of the Bad Fight).<ref name="enchis"/> The conquest of Campeche and the rest of the Yucatán Peninsula began in earnest in 1540, under Francisco de Montejos, [[Francisco de Montejo|senior]] and [[Francisco de Montejo (el Mozo)|junior]].<ref name="alisauriches"/><ref name="enchis"/>

The Spanish introduced sugar cane and other crops in the area, starting in the 1540s, but the main value of the area was the port of Campeche, established in 1540 where the old Maya village used to be.<ref name="alisauriches"/><ref name="comeback">{{cite journal |last=Murphy-Larronde |first=Suzanne |date=May–June 2002 |title=Colonial comeback for Campeche |journal=Américas |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=6–13 }}</ref> During the colonial era, it was a commercial port equal to [[Havana]] and [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] even though piracy was a constant threat. It shipped valuable exports such as agricultural goods, tropical hardwoods and [[logwood|dyewood]], then a widely used textile dye in Europe. It also handled gold and silver from other areas in Mexico going to Spain. Imported items to the port included luxury items such as Italian marble and crystal chandeliers from [[Austria]].<ref name="alisauriches"/><ref name="comeback"/> The Spanish built a European-based colonial city here and as it became rich, it was filled with large mansions. However, to survive in the hot and humid environment, the Europeans also adapted a number of Maya products such as hammocks for sleeping and storing drinking water in hollow gourds. They also built with the area's local red cedar, mahogany and "sahcab" a local limestone.<ref name="comeback"/> The shipping in these waters attracted pirates such as [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]], [[Francis Drake]], [[Diego the Mulatto]], [[Henry Morgan]], [[Cornelis Jol]], [[Bartolomeu Português]], [[Lewis Scot]] and [[Roche Braziliano]].<ref name="alisauriches"/><ref name="fortificada">{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/campeche-ciudad-fortificada.html |title=Campeche, ciudad fortificada |first=Carlos |last=Puga Villarino |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=es |trans-title=Campeche, fortified city |access-date=December 9, 2011 |archive-date=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217055010/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/campeche-ciudad-fortificada.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Most of the attacks were at the port of Campeche, but Champontón also suffered significant attacks in 1644 and 1672. Fortification of the city of Campeche began as early as 1610, but these structures were insufficient.<ref name="enchis"/> The worst pirate attack occurred in 1685, when [[Laurens de Graaf]] sacked the city of Campeche and the surrounding [[hacienda]]s for over thirty days, killing about a third of the area's population.<ref name="alisauriches"/><ref name="enchis"/> This prompted far more extensive fortification with numerous forts and a wall around the city that measured {{convert|2560|m|}} in an irregular polygon shape. Most of the forts survived but only {{convert|500|m|}} of the original wall remains.<ref name="fortificada"/> These fortifications cut the threat of pirate attacks but it remained walled until 1890.<ref name="alisauriches"/> Campeche was officially recognized as a city in 1774 (the first in southeast Mexico) and in 1784 was declared a minor port. In 1804, the port was closed due to the war between Spain and England. This caused discontentment in the city and fomented insurgent tendencies.<ref name="enchis"/>

Campeche remained a wealthy and important port until the early 19th century, when a number of events brought on the decline. In 1811, the port of [[Sisal, Yucatán|Sisal]] was opened in what is now the State of Yucatán, taking much of the city's business.<ref name="alisauriches"/> Another issue was that Independence brought the abolition of slavery, cutting agricultural production. The lack of shipping made the city relatively isolated from [[Mexico City]]. From the 19th century until the latter 20th, the state's economy was dependent on agriculture, fishing, logging and salt mining.<ref name="alisauriches"/><ref name="comeback"/>

In September 1821, the city of Campeche proclaimed its adherence to the [[Plan of Iguala]] and the new Independent government of Mexico, forcing out its last Spanish governor a month later. At [[Mexican War of Independence|Independence]], Campeche was one of the two most important cities on the Yucatán Peninsula, along with [[Mérida, Yucatán|Mérida]]. There was political friction between the two. Campeche was the more liberal of the two, and supported the [[1824 Mexican Constitution]] which established the Federal Republic. In 1824, Campeche's representative proposed that the peninsula be divided into two states: Mérida and Campeche but this was not accepted. Political divisions intensified along with the nationwide [[Reform War|struggle between Liberals and Conservatives]].<ref name="enchis"/>

Despite Campeche's and Mérida's differences, both were involved in an insurrection against Mexico City headed by Jerónimo López de Llergo in 1839 with the aim of creating an [[Republic of Yucatán|independent state of Yucatán]]. After initial victories, López de Llergo proclaimed the peninsula independent and in 1841, the Constitution of the Yucatán was promulgated on federalist principles. Yucatán independence did not solve the peninsula's internal political problems. Mérida's trade with Havana continued but Campeche's trade with Mexico City was cut off. Campeche wanted to rejoin Mexico for this reason and [[Andrés Quintana Roo]] tried to work out a settlement between the two cities. Mexican president [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] then sent an expedition to force the Yucatán back into Mexico. More fighting came with the outbreak of the [[Caste War]], in 1847, an indigenous rebellion that took place in Campeche and the rest of the Yucatán. This and foreign pressure to pay debts forced the Yucatan to formally reintegrate into Mexico in 1849.<ref name="enchis"/>

The [[Mexican Constitution of 1857|Constitution of 1857]] completely broke the schism between Campeche and Mérida with various rebellions breaking out. During one of these 150 men took over one of the main forts of Campeche and demanded a political union consisting of it, Champotón and Isla del Carmen. Other settlements in the west of the peninsula expressed their desire to be partitioned with these areas as a new state. In 1858, representatives from Campeche and Mérida signed an agreement to divide the peninsula, which was ratified to make the division official.<ref name="enchis"/>

During the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French Intervention in Mexico]], forces under Felipe Navarrete took Campeche and forced the state to rejoin the rest of the Yucatán. In 1864, insurgents defeated the imperial army in [[Hecelchakán]] and in 1867, they retook Campeche to regain the state's independence.<ref name="enchis"/>

During the [[Mexican Revolution]], Manuel Castilla Brito took up arms in Campeche in support of [[Francisco I. Madero]]. However, the insurgents were defeated by General Manuel Rivera, a [[Victoriano Huerta]] supporter in 1913. Forces loyal to [[Venustiano Carranza]] entered Campeche in 1914. Slavery and serfdom was abolished on the haciendas. In 1917, Campeche wrote its current constitution.<ref name="enchis"/>

There was some improvement in the state's economy starting in the 1950s when fishing and timber industries became more developed and there was better communication between the state and Mexico City.<ref name="comeback"/> In 1955, the [[University of Campeche]] was founded and a state system of middle schools was begun.<ref name="enchis"/>
However, Campeche's main economic change come with the discovery of oil off its shores in a shallow water region called the [[Sonda de Campeche]]. This oil was discovered by a fisherman named Rudesindo Cantarell in 1971, who reported an oil slick. In 1975, the first oil platform, called Chac Number One began operations. The first set of offshore platforms were completed by 1979.<ref name="enchis"/> The find has made the state the top producer of petroleum in Mexico, providing 70% of all oil pumped in the country.<ref name="alisauriches"/> The economic boom tripled the population of the city of Campeche in ten years, and nearly doubled that of Ciudad del Carmen, which before was only a small fishing village.<ref name="enfoque">{{cite news |title=Enfoque/ Campeche: Pemex y el carnaval |first=Arturo |last=Cano |newspaper=El Norte |location=Monterrey, Mexico |date=February 25, 1996 |page=12 |language=es |trans-title=Focus/Campeche: Pemez and Carnival }}</ref> However, the production of oil has brought environmental problems to the area, especially fishing yields, as well as internal strife between locals and newcomers.<ref name="carmenconnect">{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2841 |title=Ciudad del Carmen, Campeche |first=Linda |last=Watts |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |date=November 25, 2008 |access-date=December 9, 2011 |archive-date=October 18, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231018195215/https://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2841-ciudad-del-carmen-campeche/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the mid-1980s, about 25,000 Guatemalan refugees had fled into the state to escape [[Guatemalan Civil War|civil war there]].<ref name="enchis"/>

The oil money allowed for the revitalization of the city of Campeche starting in the 1980s. The State Office of Cultural Heritage Sites and Monuments bought abandoned properties to restore them for use as museums, schools, theaters and a library. More than a thousand facades and monuments have been refurbished in the historic center and the oldest residential areas.<ref name="comeback"/>

In the 1990s, a number of textile mills of the "[[maquiladora]]" type were opened in the state.

Only 3.3% of the state's land is used for raising crops due to the soil composition. Over ninety percent of cropland is used for seasonal crops such as corn with the rest used for perennials such as fruit trees. The most important crop is corn, followed by rice and sorghum. Other important crops include jalapeño chili peppers, watermelon, sugar cane and various tropical and non-tropical fruit-bearing trees, especially citrus and [[mango]].<ref name="actecon"/> Most cattle are raised in the center and south of the state for both meat and milk products and account for the most product by volume. In the north, most commercially raised livestock is domestic fowl mostly chickens and turkeys, but domestic fowl is raised in most rural homes all over the state. Sheep and goats are raised sparsely all over the state, depending on local vegetation. Forestry, including the extraction of precious tropical hardwoods, remains an important economic activity despite the degradation of many of the state's forests.

[[Campeche, Campeche|Campeche]] is one of the least known and most overlooked colonial cities in Mexico, mostly bypassed by those visiting more famous destinations in the Yucatan peninsula.<ref name="alisauriches"/> The city's historic buildings are protected by decree to keep them from being destroyed or altered by the growth of the city.<ref name="alisauriches"/> Campeche was one of the most important ports in [[New Spain]]. It suffered more than 21 major pirate attacks in the colonial era. After 1685, the city's main fortifications were begun taking 24 years to complete. They succeeded in stopping major pirate attacks, with only one, Barbillas, finding a way to enter the city in 1708. The fortifications consisted of a formidable wall with four main gates, three opening to land and one to the sea. It also included a number of forts such as San Carlos, Santa Rosa, San Juan and San Francisco.<ref name="baluartes">{{cite web |url=http://www.campeche.travel/web/es/pagina/baluartes-y-murallas/6 |title=Baluartes y murallas |publisher=Secretary of Tourism State of Campeche |location=Campeche, Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Fortifications and walls |access-date=December 9, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221160450/http://www.campeche.travel/web/es/pagina/baluartes-y-murallas/6 |archive-date=December 21, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Stories persist that many of the mansions had tunnels to escape pirates, but these have never been found.<ref name="alisauriches"/>

The state has a number of colonial-era churches. The Asunción church in [[Dzitbalché]] was constructed in the 18th century, with a pointed arch doorway, choral window and bell-gable. The Guadalupe Church in Bécal, Calkiní was built in the 18th century. The San Diego Apóstol Church in Nunkiní, Calkiní was built in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The church and former monastery of San Luis Obispo is located in Calkiní, built in the 17th century of stone, wood and metal over a former Mayan temple. The facade is simple with a bell-gable and there remains only one of its original Baroque altarpieces, which was made in the 16th century. The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Campeche|Catedral de Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción]] is from the 16th century. Its façade is of worked stone with two levels marked off by two grooved pilasters. The San Francisco Church in Campeche was established in the 16th century although the current building dates from the 17th. The church marks the spot where the first mass was held on mainland America. Most of the state's colonial era churches are located in and near the city of Campeche, with some in Ciudad del Carmen. The Nuestra Señora del Carmen Church in Ciudad del Carmen was built in the 18th century. The Sagrado Corazón de Jesús Church was built in the 18th century in Sabancuy, Carmen. The church and former monastery of San Francisco de Asís was begun in the 16th century by the Franciscans in Hecelchakán.<ref name="turismoenc"/>

Outside of the city of Campeche, much of the notable civil architecture in the state is found on the various former haciendas.<ref name="turismoenc"/> Many of these haciendas have been turned into hotels, spas and other tourist attractions. Hacienda Blanca Flor is located in Hecelchakán outside Campeche. This hacienda was a site of one of the bloodiest battles of the [[Caste War]]. Hacienda Santa Cruz is between Campeche and Calkiní in the Nunkiní community. It is dated to the middle of the 18th century established to raise cattle. It continued operating until the Mexican Revolution. Hacienda San José Carpizo is in the Champotón municipality, founded in 1871 by José María Carpizo Sánchez and was one of the most important on the Yucatán Peninsula, raising cattle. It survived the [[Mexican Revolution]] until its workers abandoned it in the 1940s. Hacienda San Luis Carpizo is located in Champotón and belonged to José María Carpizo, dedicated to agriculture. This hacienda was restored by the Mexican Army to house the Marine Infantry School in 1999. Hacienda Uayamón is near the city of Campeche with origins in the 16th century. It was attacked and its owner killed in the raid by [[Laurens de Graaf]] in 1685. It continued to operate until the Mexican Revolution and today it is home to the Hotel de Gran Turismo. Hacienda Tankuché was dedicated to raising dyewood (''palo de tinte'') but changed later to [[Agave fourcroydes|henequen]]. Despite losing most of its land in the Revolution, its henequen mill continued to operate until the 1980s.<ref name="haciendasgob">{{cite web |url=http://www.campeche.travel/web/es/pagina/haciendas/13 |title=Haciendas |publisher=Secretary of Tourism State of Campeche |location=Campeche, Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Haciendas |access-date=December 9, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201190118/http://www.campeche.travel/web/es/pagina/haciendas/13 |archive-date=December 1, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

These generally take advantage of the local rivers, springs and cenotes. Ecotourism includes caves such as Xculhoc, Chuncedro and Xtacumbilxuna'an or Mujer Escondida.<ref name="turismoenc"/>

===Archaeological sites in Campeche===
[[File:Panoramic Edzná.JPG|thumb|left|View of the [[Edzna]] archaeological site]]

Much of Campeche's territory is filled with various [[archeological site]]s, almost all of which are Mayan. Maya sites in Campeche include [[Acanmul]], [[Balamku|Balamkú]], [[Becan|Becán]], [[Bolonchén, Campeche|Bolonchén]], [[Calakmul]], [[Chactún]], [[Chicanná]], [[Chunlimón]], [[Edzna|Edzná]], [[Jaina Island|Isla de Jaina]], [[Lagunita]], the [[Petén Basin]], [[Río Bec]], [[Uaymil|Isla Uaymil]], [[Xculoc]], [[Xpuhil]], and [[Xtampak]]. These sites are less visited than sites to the east such as [[Chichen Itza]], and [[Tulum]].<ref name="alisauriches"/> An early important site is [[Edzna]], located near the city of Campeche in a region known as los Chenes. It was one of the most important ceremonial centers in the pre-Classic Maya period (300–900 CE). Its building show Petén, Chenes and Puuc influence, with a large acropolis surrounded by various temples, the most important of which is the Pyramid of the Five Floors.<ref name="alisauriches"/><ref name="turismoenc">{{cite web |url=http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_campeche |title=Atractivos Culturales y Turísticos |year=2010 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios y Delegaciones de México- Campeche |publisher=Instituto para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal and Secretaría de Gobernación |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Cultural and Tourist Attractions |access-date=December 9, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=March 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It was discovered in the 1920s and excavated in the 1940s. It is located away from other Mayan settlements on the peninsula and was probably a collection center for the agriculture products grown in the area, reaching its height between 600 and 900. These were sent to the city of [[Tikal]] in exchange for ritualistic adornment for the site. Its most important building is the Pyramid of the Five Stories, built as its name implies. Another important find came in the 1990s. During the planting season in early May, archeologist Antonio Benavides noticed that the setting sun illuminates a stucco mask hanging one of the pyramid's rooms. The effect also happens in August, during harvest and it is believed to be related to the asking and receiving of abundant crops.<ref name="alisauriches"/>

The largest archeological site in the state is [[Calakmul]], which means "twin heaps" in the Mayan language. It is located in the Petén region built in the late Classic period (500–900 CE). Calakmal is estimated to have been populated around 1000 BCE with its height at around 600 In 695 CE, Calakmul was conquered by Tikal and the city fell into decline. Calakmul is located in the interior rainforest of the state in a biosphere named after it near the Guatemala border. The site extends over {{convert|70|km2||abbr=on}} and was one of the largest cities of Mesoamerica. Its temples were mostly dedicated to ancestor worship encircling the palaces of the elite in the center. There are an estimated 6,000 structures at the site with only half a dozen restored. The two most important structures are the twin pyramids of Temple II and Temple VII, similar to structures found at Tikal. Temple II is tallest at {{convert|50|m||abbr=on}} high. The site has been heavily looted by grave robbers.<ref name="alisauriches"/><ref name="turismoenc"/>

While most sites are in the interior rainforest of the state, there are fifty-five archeological sites on the coast alone, mostly remnants of small villages. The [[Isla de Jaina]] is one of the best preserved archeological sites in the state because of its location on an island on the coast, surrounded by estuaries and mangroves. It requires special permission to visit. Unlike others on the coast, it was a true city.<ref name="legado"/> Other sites include Can-mayab-mul in Nunkiní, Xculhoc in Hecelchakán, Chunan-tunich, Xtampak, Hochob, Pak-chén and Dzebilnocac in Hopelchén, El Tigre in Candelaria, La Xoch and Chun Cedro in Tenabo and Becán in Calakmul.<ref name="turismoenc"/>
