==Chemical weapons and other production==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2023}}
Modern-day Dzerzhinsk is a large center of the Russian chemicals production industry. In the past, the city was also among Russia's principal production sites for chemical weapons. Owing to its strategic significance, this city was, until recently,{{when|date=October 2024}} [[closed city|officially closed]] to foreign visitors.

Manufacture of various chemical weapons started under [[Soviet]] government control in 1941, particularly concentrating on the production of [[lewisite]]—the poisonous effects of which are owed to its arsenic trioxide content—and [[yperite]] ([[mustard gas]]). The factory producing these substances was called the ''Kaprolactam'' (or ''Caprolaktam'') Organic Glass Factory, and in addition to its [[arsenic]]-based weapons, also produced [[prussic acid]] and [[phosgene]].

Chemical weapons production at Dzerzhinsk ceased in 1965. Some materials were transferred to storage units, while large amounts of waste material—frequently containing high concentrations of [[arsenic]]—were buried in dumps on the site of the factory. Full dismantling of the yperite facility was commenced in 1994. As of 1998, the lewisite production unit was still not completely disassembled.{{cn|date=October 2024}}

{{As of|2008}}, Dzerzhinsk had 38 large industrial enterprises, which exported goods worldwide. About one thousand varieties of chemical products are produced in Dzerzhinsk. The largest factories, which exist {{As of|2012|lc=y}} or existed in the past, include:
*''[[Ya. M. Sverdlova State Owned Enterprise|Sverdlov]] Plant, FSE (Federal State Enterprise)'' manufactures munitions, battle and industrial explosives, and chemicals for industrial purposes (phenol-formaldehyde resin, [[epoxy resin]], carbamide-furane resin, plasticizers, hardeners of various modifications, [[nitrobenzene]], sulphanole,{{huh|date=September 2024}} [[acetic anhydride]], various cleaners and detergents, as well as other products). The plant is included in the presidential list of the country's strategic enterprises. This is Dzerzhinsk's largest factory. On 20 October 2024 it was reported that the plant had been struck by Ukrainian drones. The extent of the damage to the plant was unclear.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/20/ukraine-strikes-key-russian-explosives-manufacturer-general-staff-says | title=Ukraine strikes key Russian explosives manufacturer, general staff says }}</ref>

*''Korund, JSC'' (opened in 1915, the first factory in Russia to produce [[cyanide]], still operational). This plant produces [[corundum]] for lasers and other applications. It is the oldest enterprise in Dzerzhinsk. In 2004, the plant was temporarily closed due to bankruptcy.
*''Dzerzhinskhimmash, JSC'' (opened in 1941, currently (2013) makes distillation and column equipment, evaporators, heat exchangers).
*''Sintez, JSC''. Produces [[acetone]], [[carbonyl iron]], [[diethanolamine]], [[isopropanol]], [[methylamine]], [[phenol]], etc.

==Pollution==
According to the September&nbsp;12, 2007, study by the [[Blacksmith Institute]], Dzerzhinsk is one of the worst-polluted cities of the world and has a life expectancy of 42 years for men and 47 for women, with the 2003 death rate exceeding its birth rate by 260%.<ref name="black">{{cite web|url=http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/site10g.php|title=The top most polluted places|publisher=[[Blacksmith Institute]]|access-date=September 13, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006180304/http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/site10g.php|archive-date=October 6, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Environmental action groups such as [[Greenpeace]] attribute such low life expectancy to high levels of [[Persistent organic pollutant|persistent organic chemicals]], particularly [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]].  The Blacksmith Institute also names [[sarin]], [[lewisite]], [[sulfur mustard]], [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[phosgene]], [[lead]], and organic chemicals among the worst pollutants.<ref name="black" />  Parts of Dzerzhinsk's water are contaminated with dioxins and [[phenol]] at levels that are reportedly seventeen million times the safe limit.<ref name="black" />

Dzerzhinsk's environmental agency estimates that almost 300,000 tons of chemical waste were dumped in the city between 1930 and 1998.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The Ecology Committee of the Russian [[State Duma]] also considers Dzerzhinsk among the top ten cities with disastrous ecological conditions.<ref>[http://www.nta-nn.ru/news/item/?ID=108269 Дзержинск вошел в десятку наиболее неблагополучных с экологической точки зрения территорий РФ&nbsp;– Косариков (Dzerzhinsk Makes It to the Top Ten Most Ecologically Adverse Cities of the Russian Federation)] {{in lang|ru}}</ref>

Dzerzhinsk's City Administration, however, asserts that the Blacksmith Institute report is false, stating, for example, that since [[sarin]] had never been produced in the city (seems to be credible according to Fedorov, p262, Table 7.1),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pseudology.org/razbory/FedorovLA_Tom1.pdf| title=Химическое вооружение - война с собственным народом| language=RU }}</ref> it cannot be one of the major pollutants. Also, according to the city's health department, the average life expectancy in the city was 64&nbsp;years in 2006. Askhat Kayumkov, the head of the ''Dront'' public ecological organization, which was quoted as a source by the Blacksmith Institute, states that his organization never provided the Blacksmith Institute with data of any kind. Furthermore, he does not believe that Dzerzhinsk is one of the most polluted cities in Russia, much less in the whole world.<ref>[http://www.reporter-dz.ru/2006/10/27/kto-zakazal-dzerzhinsk.phtml «Дзержинский репортёр». «Кто "заказал" Дзержинск»?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003224126/http://www.reporter-dz.ru/2006/10/27/kto-zakazal-dzerzhinsk.phtml |date=October 3, 2011 }} Официальная критика присутствия Дзержинска списке Института Блэксмита (''Dzerzhinsky Reportyor'' newspaper.  Official criticism of the inclusion of Dzerzhinsk into the Blacksmith Institute list) {{in lang|ru}}</ref>

In the end, however, despite the ecological situation in the city being at its best in the previous 80 years (mostly due to bankruptcies and closures of the polluting factories), several locations in the city pose a tangible ecological risk. These sites include the 110ha Igumnovo landfill, toxic waste burial grounds, and a so-called "White Sea" composed of discarded chemical wastes.<ref name="reaktsiya">[http://www.reakcia.ru/article/?1391 «Живые здесь не ходят».
