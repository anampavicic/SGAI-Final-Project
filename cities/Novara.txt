'''Novara''' ({{IPA|it|noˈvaːra|lang|It-Novara.ogg}}; <small>[[Novarese Lombard|Novarese]]:</small> {{IPA-lmo|nuˈ(ʋ)aːra|}}) is the capital city of the [[province of Novara]] in the [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]] region in northwest [[Italy]], to the west of [[Milan]]. With 101,916 inhabitants (on 1 January 2021), it is the second most populous city in Piedmont after [[Turin]]. It is an important crossroads for commercial traffic along the routes from Milan to Turin and from [[Genoa]] to [[Switzerland]]. Novara lies between the streams [[Agogna]] and [[Terdoppio]] in northeastern Piedmont, {{cvt|50|km|mi}} from Milan and {{cvt|95|km|mi}} from Turin. It is only {{cvt|15|km|mi}} distant from the river [[Ticino]], which marks the border with [[Lombardy]] region.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Novara}}
[[File:Novara MuraRomane.jpg|thumb|left|Roman walls in Novara.]]
Novara was founded around 89 BC by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], when the local [[Gaul]]s obtained Roman citizenship. Its name is formed from ''Nov'', meaning "new", and ''Aria'', the name the [[Cisalpine Gaul]]s used for the surrounding region.

Ancient ''Novaria'', which dates to the time of the [[Ligures]] and the [[Celts]], was a [[municipium]] and was situated on the road from Vercellae ([[Vercelli]]) to ([[Mediolanum]]) Milan. Its position on perpendicular roads (still intact today) dates to the time of the Romans. After the city was destroyed in 386 by [[Magnus Maximus]] for having supported his rival [[Valentinian II]], it was rebuilt by [[Theodosius I]]. Subsequently, it was sacked by [[Radagaisus]] (in 405) and [[Attila]] (in 452).

Under the [[Lombards]], Novara became a [[Lombard Duchies|duchy]]; under [[Charles the Fat]], a countship. Novara came to enjoy the rights of a [[Free Imperial City|free imperial city]]. In 1110, it was conquered by [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] and destroyed, but in 1167 it joined the [[Lombard League]]. At the end of the 12th century, it accepted the protection of [[Milan]] and became practically a dominion of the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]] and later of the [[House of Sforza|Sforza]]. In the [[Battle of Novara (1513)|Battle of Novara]] in 1513, Swiss mercenaries defending Novara for the Sforzas of Milan routed the French troops besieging the city. This defeat ended the [[Italian Wars|French invasion of Italy]] in the [[War of the League of Cambrai]].

In 1706, Novara, which had long ago been promised by [[Filippo Maria Visconti]] to [[Amadeus VIII of Savoy]], was occupied by Savoyard troops. With the [[Peace of Utrecht]], the city, together with Milan, became part of the [[Habsburg|Habsburg Empire]]. After its occupation in 1734, Novara passed, in the following year, to the [[House of Savoy]].

[[File:Novara Piramide.jpg|thumb|left|The Ossuary of the Bicocca district of Novara, in memory of the [[Battle of Novara]]]]
After [[Napoleon]]'s campaign in Italy, Novara became the capital of the [[Department of the Agogna]], but was then reassigned to the House of Savoy in 1814. In 1821, it was the site of [[Battle of Novara (1821)|a battle]] in which regular [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinian]] troops defeated the Piedmontese constitutional liberals. In the even larger [[Battle of Novara (1849)|Battle of Novara]] in 1849, the Sardinian army was defeated by the [[Imperial Austrian Army (1806–1867)|Austrian army]] of Field Marshal [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz]]. This defeat led to the abdication of [[Charles Albert of Sardinia]] and to the partial occupation of the city by the [[Austria]]ns. The defeat of the [[Sardinia]]ns can be seen as the beginning of the [[Italian unification]] movement.{{Citation needed|date=October 2023}}

A decree in 1859 created the province of Novara, which then included the present-day provinces of [[Province of Vercelli|Vercelli]], [[Province of Biella|Biella]], and [[Province of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola|Verbano-Cusio-Ossola]].

The city of Novara had a population of 25,144 in 1861. Industrialisation during the 20th century brought an increase in the city's population to 102,088 in 1981. The city's population has changed little in subsequent years.

[[Oscar Luigi Scalfaro]], former [[president of Italy]] and Italian senator for life, was born in Novara in 1918.

The city was the set for the 1971 film "[[The Working Class Goes to Heaven]]" by Elio Petri; the film was presented at [[Cannes Film Festival]] and has won multiple awards; its soundtrack was composed by [[Ennio Morricone]], who also appears in a cameo.<ref>{{Cite web |title=La classe operaia va in paradiso.

==Architecture==
[[File:Novara panoramica08.jpg|thumb|left|View of Novara]]
Novara's sights can be divided into two groupings. The city's most important sights lie within its historic centre, the area once enclosed by the city walls. However, several important sights also lie outside the line of the former city walls.

Novara has numerous churches and historic buildings; some of these have been restored over the years. The most significant architectural element is the majestic dome, 121 metres high, designed by the architect-engineer [[Alessandro Antonelli]]. Now known as the [[Basilica of San Gaudenzio]], it was built in 1888. It has now become a symbol of the city and a distinctive sign of its panorama, observable from all the roads that lead to the city. The bell tower is also of particular interest; it was designed by [[Benedetto Alfieri]], uncle of the more famous [[Vittorio Alfieri]].

The old urban core makes up the "Historic centre", situated in the district of the same name. Novara once had an encircling wall, which was demolished to permit urban development. Of the old wall, there remains only the ''Barriera Albertina'', a complex of two neo-classical buildings that constituted the gate of entry to the city, the required passageway for those who travelled from Turin to Milan. After their removal, the walls were replaced by the present-day ''baluardi'', the broad, tree-lined boulevards that surround the Historic Centre.

The centre of the religious life of the city is the [[Novara Cathedral]], in the neo-classical style, also designed by Alessandro Antonelli. It rises exactly where the temple of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] stood in the time of the Romans. Facing the Duomo is the oldest building in Novara today: the early Christian ''Battistero'' (Baptistry).

Close to the Duomo is the courtyard of the ''[[Broletto]]'' (the historic meeting place of the city council), the centre of the political life of the imperial free city of Novara. Overlooking the courtyard of the Broletto are the ''Palazzo del Podestà'' ("Palace of the [[Podestà]]"), ''Palazzetto dei Paratici'' ("Little Palace of the Paratici Family"), site of the Civic Museum and of the Gallery of Modern Art, the Palace of the City Council, and a building of the 15th century.

Not far from the Piazza della Repubblica (formerly Piazza Duomo) is the Piazza Cesare Battisti (known to Novaresi as the ''Piazza delle Erbe'', "Herbs square"), which constitutes the exact centre of the city of Novara.

In Piazza Giacomo Matteotti stands the ''Palazzo Natta-Isola'', seat of the province and of the prefecture of Novara. The landmark feature of this palace is its clock tower. Extending from this square is the via Fratelli Rosselli, along which is the ''Palazzo Cabrino'', the official seat of the administrative offices of the city. As it was a Roman city, the street network of Novara is characterized by a [[cardo]] and a [[Decumanus Maximus]], which correspond respectively to the present-day Corso Cavour and Corso Italia. The two streets cross at the so-called "Angolo delle Ore" (Corner of the Hours).

The city conservatory, [[Conservatorio Guido Cantelli]], named after Novara's [[Guido Cantelli]], is located in via Collegio Gallarini, 1 (facing largo Luigi Sante Colonna in the area between piazza Puccini and Novara's hospital).<ref name="stampa33">{{cite web |title=Novara, posato il ponteggio sulla facciata del conservatorio Cantelli colpito da un fulmine |date=25 July 2020 |url=https://www.lastampa.it/novara/2020/07/25/news/novara-posato-il-ponteggio-sulla-facciata-del-conservatorio-cantelli-colpito-da-un-fulmine-1.39123496 |publisher=[[La Stampa]] |access-date=6 July 2021 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20210706104508/https://www.lastampa.it/novara/2020/07/25/news/novara-posato-il-ponteggio-sulla-facciata-del-conservatorio-cantelli-colpito-da-un-fulmine-1.39123496 |archive-date=6 July 2021 |url-status=live }}</ref> The conservatory, founded in 1996, was established in a building built in the 1700s, once known as the ''casone''. In 1766, the building, after a donation from the Gallarini family, started to be used as a college. Between 1854 and 1905, several artistic features, such as coloured tiles and terracotta decorations on the facade were added.<ref name="turismo">{{cite web |title=Collegio Gallarini |url=https://www.turismonovara.it/it/ArteStoriaScheda?Id=146 |publisher=Turismonovara.it |access-date=6 July 2021 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20210706092103/https://www.turismonovara.it/it/ArteStoriaScheda?Id=146 |archive-date=6 July 2021 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The largest square is Piazza Martiri della Libertà (formerly Piazza Castello) dominated by the equestrian statue of [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]], the first king of Italy.  Overlooking the Piazza Martiri is the ''Castello Visconteo-Sforzesco'', built by the [[dukes of Milan|Milanese dukes]] [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]] and [[Sforza]], and the [[Teatro Coccia]]. The Castello Visconteo-Sforzesco, once much larger than the complex that remains today, is surrounded by the ''Allea'', one of the largest public gardens in Novara.

Other important squares are:

*Largo Cavour, dominated by the statue of [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Cavour]], recently restored.
*Piazza Garibaldi, the square facing the Novara Railway Station, also recently restored and featuring the statue of the hero of two worlds and a fountain with the statue of a [[mondina]].
*Piazza Gramsci, formerly Piazza del Rosario, location, after the restoration of 2005, of the landmark statue of Icarus.

===Outside the ''Baluardi''===
[[File:Novara SanNazzaroCosta.jpg|thumb|Church of San Nazzaro della Costa]]
Places of interest situated outside the belt of the ''baluardi'' include the Church of San Nazzaro della Costa, with its attached abbey, restored in the 15th century by [[Bernardino of Siena]], and the Ossuary of Bicocca, in pyramidal form, which stands in the neighbourhood of Bicocca, in memory of the fallen soldiers of the historic battle of 23 March 1849, between the Piedmontese (Sardinia) and Austrians. Worthy of note are the [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie]] (Saints Martino and Gaudenzio), built beginning in 1477 by the Augustinians, whose interior consists of a single nave with lateral chapels and paintings attributed to artists of the 15th century, among them Daniele de Bosis.

===Religious buildings===

*Chiesa di Ognissanti (12th century)
*Santa Maria delle Grazie, also known as San Martino (15th century)
*San Pietro al Rosario (1599-1618)
*San Marco (17th century)
*Oratory of San Giovanni Decollato (17th century)
*Santa Maria della Salute (17th century)
*Sant'Eufemia (17th century)
*Chiesa del Carmine (18th to 19th centuries)
*Nuova Chiesa di San Rocco (21st century)

==Festivals and events==
*22 January: Novara celebrates annually the Feast of San Gaudenzio (Saint Gaudentius of Novara), the patron saint of Novara. Throughout the day, it is possible to visit the tomb of the saint and to obtain the typical roasted chestnuts, also known as ''marroni di Cuneo'' (" Cuneo chestnuts").
*23 March: Re-enactment of the 1849 Battle of Novara, with period uniforms and weapons.
*On 25 April, Liberation Day, as in many other Italian cities, the Novaresi organise numerous initiatives to commemorate the [[Italian resistance movement]], and in particular, the [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] who fought around Novara and in the "Partisan Republic of the Ossola".
*Since 2001, ''Giovani Espressioni'' ("Young Expressions") has been held in Novara. This is a music festival for emerging young musicians, organised by Staff Millennium, a performance agency, of which Alessandro Marchetti is the artistic director. The "Espressioni Contest" is of special importance as a showcase for emerging bands that picks a winner every year. Among the noted artists who have participated are Negramaro, Caparezza, Finley, Vallanzaska, Extrema, and Blaze Bailey.
*Since 2005, Novara hosts the "Novara Gospel Festival", which is composed of workshops, local tours, and obviously gospel concerts in the main theatre of the city. It is probably one of the most important festivals of this music in Italy, also because the main event is a concert of the most appreciated gospel singers, such as Kirk Franklin, Donnie Mc Clurkin, etc.

===Railways===
The city is served by three railway stations:
*Vignale FS, a small station operated by the [[Ferrovie dello Stato]] (regional trains)
*[[Novara railway station|Novara FS]], the principal station of the Ferrovie dello Stato, Italy's national railway (regional, national and international trains).
*Novara Nord, the station operated by the [[LeNord]] railroad. The new station in via Leonardo da Vinci opened in 2005 (regional and high-speed trains (only 2006) trains).

===Motorways and main roads===
Novara is linked to Turin and Milan by the [[A4 (Italy)|A4]] motorway (via the junctions Novara Ovest and Novara Est). The [[Autostrada A26 (Italy)|A26]] motorway crosses most of Novara province, but there is not a junction that links it directly with Novara. To reach Novara from the A26, one must exit at Vercelli Est, but one can also reach Novara by way of the A4, which crosses the A26 at a junction. Novara is served by a system of dual-carriageway bypasses. The oldest such bypass is the Tangenziale Est, directly linked with the motorway junction Novara Est. In 2003, road works were completed on the Tangenziale Sud.

The S11 trunk road from Milan and [[Magenta, Lombardy|Magenta]] passes through Novara on its way to [[Vercelli]] and Turin. Trunk roads to the north and south also link Novara to the motorway network.

==Sports==
[[Novara FC]] is an association football club based in Novara. There is a professional women's [[Italian Women's Volleyball League|Serie A1]] volleyball team, [[AGIL Volley|Igor Novara Volley]].

{{See also|List of mayors of Novara}}
The current mayor of Novara is [[Alessandro Canelli]], elected in June 2016 and confirmed in October 2021, representing a coalition between traditional right-wing parties such as [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]]  and the new far-right composed by [[Lega (political party)]] and [[Brothers of Italy]].

===Administrative subdivisions===
Novara is divided into thirteen wards (''[[circoscrizioni]]''); several of these are formed of a number of quarters (''[[quartieri]]''), zones, and/or ''[[frazioni]]''.

According to changes in local electoral laws, from June 2011 elections, they were stripped of their elective bodies (council and president), thus remaining as a simple internal partition of the [[Comune]].
