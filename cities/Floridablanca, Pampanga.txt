'''Floridablanca''', officially the '''Municipality of Floridablanca''' ({{lang-pam|Balen ning Floridablanca}}; {{lang-fil|Bayan ng Floridablanca}}) is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Pampanga]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 135,542 people.{{PH census|current}} Floridablanca is a part of the province of the [[Pampanga]] located in Central Luzon lying north of [[Dinalupihan]], [[Bataan]] and south-southwest of [[San Fernando, Pampanga]].

==Etymology==
Floridablanca is derived from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] which translates to "white flower." However, there are two versions of the name's origin:<ref name="history" />
*in honor of [[José Moñino, 1st Count of Floridablanca]], a former [[List of prime ministers of Spain|chief minister of Spain]] whom the locals believed to have visited the place in the early 1800s despite the lack of evidence of his visit; or
*white flowers of a pandacaqui plant (''[[Tabernaemontana pandacaqui]]'') that flourished in the town, considered as a more credible origin. Florida means "Flower" and Blanca means "Fragrant". 

Previously, the town was named San Jose de Calampaui, which is derived from Spanish for [[Saint Joseph]], its patron saint.

==History==
[[File:Landing Fields - Philippines - Del Carmen - NARA - 68160290.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Floridablanca and Del Carmen, November 17, 1931]]

Floridablanca was founded in 1823 as Hacienda de San Jose de Calampaui at the site of a monastery. In 1867, it was renamed to Pueblo de Floridablanca.

In the 1920s, the Pampanga Sugar Mill was built at Del Carmen in the 1920s. The area was the site of military bases of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] and the [[Philippine Constabulary]] from 1942 to 1946. The [[Philippine Air Force]] established [[Basa Air Base]] at a former American military airfield in 1947.<ref name="history">{{cite web |title=History of Floridablanca |url=https://www.floridablanca.gov.ph/about-us/history-of-floridablanca |website=Municipality of Floridablanca, Province of Pampanga – Abe abe king panyulung |access-date=July 18, 2023}}</ref>
