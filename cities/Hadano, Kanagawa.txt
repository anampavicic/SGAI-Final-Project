==History==
The name "Hadano" appears as a geographic term in the [[Heian period]] ''[[Wamyō Ruijushō]]'', as "Hatano", and there has been scholarly speculation as to possible connections with the [[Nara period]] [[Hata clan]]. From the late Heian period until the [[Kamakura period]], the area was divided into ''[[shōen]]'' controlled by descendants of [[Fujiwara no Hidesato]], including the [[Sengoku period|Sengoku-period]] ''[[daimyō]]'', the Hatano clan. During the [[Edo period]], it was nominally part of [[Odawara Domain]], although large portions were ''[[tenryō]]'' territory controlled by the ''[[shōgun]]'' in [[Edo]] through various ''[[hatamoto]]''.

After the [[Meiji Restoration]] and with the establishment of the district system in 1878, the area came under the control of {{Nihongo|Ōsumi District |大住郡|Ōsumi-gun}} and became Hadano town on 1 April 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. On 26 March 1896, Ōsumi District and Yurugi District were merged to form [[Naka District, Kanagawa|Naka District]]. The town began to experience rapid growth after the opening of the [[Odakyu Electric Railway]] in 1927. Hadano became a city on 1 January 1955, through the merger of former towns of Hadano and Minamihadano with the villages of Kitahadano and Higashihadano. The new city annexed neighboring the village of One, and the village of Kamihatano (from [[Ashigarakami District, Kanagawa|Ashigarakami District]]) later the same year, and annexed the town of Nishihadano in 1964.

==Government==
Hadano has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 24 members. Hadano contributes two members to the Kanagawa Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Kanagawa 17th district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Hadano was a regional commercial center during the Edo period following the introduction of tobacco cultivation to the area. The curtains closed on the industry's 300-year history in 1984, and the local farmers have largely converted to production of [[green tea]] and ornamental flowers. A former tobacco-trading center and processing plant belonging to Japan Tobacco and Salt Public Corporation (now [[Japan Tobacco]]) has been replaced by a large shopping mall.

==Education==
Hadano has 13 public elementary schools and nine public middle schools operated by the city government. The city has three public high schools operated by the Kanagawa Prefectural Board of Education, and the prefecture also operates one special education school for the handicapped. A private junior college, the [[Sophia Junior College]] is located within Hadano.
