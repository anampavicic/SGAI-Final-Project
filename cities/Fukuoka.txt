'''Fukuoka''' ({{langx|ja|福岡市}}, {{Transliteration|ja|Fukuoka-shi}}, {{IPA|ja|ɸɯ̥kɯoka ꜜɕi||TomJ-Fukuoka.ogg}}) is the [[List of Japanese cities by population|sixth-largest city]] in Japan and the [[capital city]] of [[Fukuoka Prefecture]], Japan. The city is built along the shores of [[Hakata Bay]], and has been a center of international commerce since ancient times. The area has long been considered the gateway to the country, as it is the nearest point among Japan's main islands to the Asian mainland. Although humans occupied the area since the [[Jomon period]], some of the earliest settlers of the [[Yayoi period]] arrived in the Fukuoka area. The city rose to prominence during the [[Yamato period]]. Because of the cross-cultural exposure, and the relatively great distance from the social and political centers of [[Kyoto]], [[Osaka]], and later, [[Edo (Tokyo)|Edo]] (Tokyo), Fukuoka gained a distinctive local culture and dialect that has persisted to the present.

Fukuoka is the most populous city on [[Kyushu|Kyūshū]] island, followed by [[Kitakyushu]]. It is the largest city and metropolitan area west of [[Keihanshin]]. The city was [[City designated by government ordinance|designated by government ordinance]] on April 1, 1972. Greater Fukuoka, with a population of 2.5&nbsp;million people (2005 census), is part of the heavily industrialized [[Fukuoka–Kitakyushu]] zone.

{{As of|2015}}, Fukuoka is Japan's sixth largest city, having passed the population of [[Kobe]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.city.fukuoka.lg.jp/soki/tokeichosa/shisei/toukei/kokusei/H27_kokuchou/27kokuchou_sokuhou.html |script-title=ja:福岡市 平成２７年国勢調査結果速報（本市独自集計） |website=city.fukuoka.lg.jp |access-date=25 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815090031/http://www.city.fukuoka.lg.jp/soki/tokeichosa/shisei/toukei/kokusei/H27_kokuchou/27kokuchou_sokuhou.html |archive-date=August 15, 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In July 2011, Fukuoka surpassed the population of [[Kyoto]]. Since the founding of Kyoto in 794, this marks the first time that a city west of the [[Kansai region]] has a larger population than Kyoto.

==History==
{{for timeline|Timeline of Fukuoka}}

===Early history===
Exchanges from the continent and the Northern Kyushu area date as far back as [[Old Stone Age]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/asia/korean_peninsula/AJ201302010006 |title=Researchers uncover deeper Japan-Korea history on weapons, letters |work=AJW by The Asahi Shimbun |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194810/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/asia/korean_peninsula/AJ201302010006 |archive-date=October 29, 2013}}</ref> It has been thought that waves of immigrants arrived in Northern Kyushu from mainland Asia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://austronesian.alotspace.com/origins%20of%20the%20japanese%20people.htm |title=Austronesia |access-date=July 11, 2013 |archive-date=October 29, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184550/http://austronesian.alotspace.com/origins%20of%20the%20japanese%20people.htm |url-status=dead}}</ref> Several [[Kofun]] exist.

Fukuoka was sometimes called the Port of {{Nihongo|[[Dazaifu, Fukuoka|Dazaifu]]|大宰府}}, a reference to the town of Dazaifu {{cvt|15|km|0}} southeast of Fukuoka. Dazaifu was an administrative capital in 663 A.D., and it has been suggested that a prehistoric capital was in the area.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Takehiko Furuta]] |script-title=ja:失われた九州王朝 |trans-title=A lost Kyushu dynasty |publisher=Asahi Publishing |year=1993}}</ref> Ancient texts, such as the [[Kojiki]], Kanyen (found in Dazaifu) and archaeology confirm this was a critical place in the founding of Japan. Some scholars<ref name="tdh">[http://www.furutasigaku.jp/efuruta/kourine/kourine.html The Truth of Descent from Heaven] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220201054/http://www.furutasigaku.jp/efuruta/kourine/kourine.html |date=December 20, 2016 }}. Yukio Yokota. Retrieved March 19, 2008.</ref> claim that it was the first place outsiders and the Imperial Family set foot, but like many early Japan origin theories, it remains contested. Central Fukuoka is sometimes still referred as [[Hakata-ku, Fukuoka|Hakata]] which is the name of the central ward.

The [[Book of Song]] records that King Bu, thought to be the [[Emperor Yūryaku]], sent a letter in 478 seeking the Chinese emperor's approval for the establishment of three ministries for administration of the kingdom similar to [[Three Ducal Ministers|those in use in China]]; the remains of a ward office and temple in {{Nihongo|Ooho|大保}}, {{cvt|15|km|0}} south from Dazaifu, may be one of these ministries. In addition, remains of the [[Kōrokan]] ({{lang|ja|鴻臚館}}, Government Guest House) were found in Fukuoka underneath a part of the ruins of [[Fukuoka Castle]].

====Historical shrines, temples and related festivals====
In 923, the [[Hakozaki Shrine]] in Fukuoka was established when the god [[Hachiman]] was transferred from the Daibu shrine in [[Honami, Fukuoka|Honami]].<ref>

There are several historically important Buddhist temples in Fukuoka. Monks would sail back to Japan from China upon completing their studies and establish temples in the heart of the port city of Hakata (now Fukuoka):
Monk [[Eisai]] founded [[Shōfuku-ji (Fukuoka)|Shōfuku-ji]] which is known today as the oldest zen temple in Japan. Eisai is also known for establishing a new sect of Zen Buddhism ([[Rinzai Zen|Rinzai]]) and for bringing tea and tea culture to Japan.
Monk [[Kukai]] established [[Tocho-ji]], and [[Joten-ji]] was built by [[Enni]] who is also known for bringing Udon noodles first from China to Japan.
[[File:Jotenji01.jpg|thumb|180px|Main Hall of Joten-ji]]

Hakata Gion Yamagata is the most famous festival in Fukuoka and
the origin of it is believed to date back to 1241, when [[Enni]], the founder of Jotenji temple had people carry him around the town on a platform while praying against the plague and eventually getting successfully rid of it.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Spots/Hakata Area/ History and Culture/Jotenji temple|url=https://gofukuoka.jp/spots/detail/26915|access-date=2024-03-20|website=Fukuoka Official Tourist Guide}}</ref>

===Mongol invasions (1274–1281)===
{{main|Mongol invasions of Japan}}
[[Kublai Khan]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] turned his attention towards Japan starting in 1268, exerting a new external pressure on Japan with which it had no experience. Kublai Khan first sent an envoy to Japan to make the Shogunate acknowledge Khan's [[suzerainty]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://factsanddetails.com/japan/cat16/sub107/item494.html |title=MONGOL INVASIONS OF JAPAN |access-date=May 22, 2018 |archive-date=March 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190305235610/http://factsanddetails.com/japan/cat16/sub107/item494.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Kamakura shogunate]] refused. [[Mongolia]] repeatedly sent envoys thereafter, each time urging the Shogunate to accept their proposal, but to no avail.

In 1274, Kublai Khan mounted an invasion of the northern part of Kyushu with a fleet of 900&nbsp;ships and 33,000&nbsp;troops, including troops from [[Goryeo]] on the [[Korean Peninsula]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wondersandmarvels.com/2015/06/blown-away-the-mongol-invasions-of-japan.html |title=Blown Away: The Mongol Invasions of Japan |date=June 22, 2015 |access-date=May 22, 2018 |archive-date=February 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228045522/http://www.wondersandmarvels.com/2015/06/blown-away-the-mongol-invasions-of-japan.html |url-status=live }}</ref> This initial invasion was compromised by a combination of incompetence and severe storms. After the invasion attempt of 1274, Japanese [[samurai]] built a stone barrier {{cvt|20|km|0}} in length bordering the coast of [[Hakata Bay]] in what is now the city of Fukuoka. The wall, 2–3 metres in height and having a base width of 3 meters, was constructed between 1276 and 1277, and was excavated in the 1930s.

Kublai sent another envoy to Japan in 1279. At that time, [[Hōjō Tokimune]] of the [[Hōjō clan]] (1251–1284) was the Eighth Regent. Not only did he decline the offer, but he beheaded the five Mongolian emissaries after summoning them to [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]]. Infuriated, Kublai organized another attack on Fukuoka Prefecture in 1281, mobilizing 140,000&nbsp;soldiers and 4,000&nbsp;ships. The Japanese defenders, numbering around 40,000, were no match for the Mongols and the invasion force made it as far as [[Dazaifu, Fukuoka|Dazaifu]], {{cvt|15|km|0}} south of the city of Fukuoka. However, the Japanese were again aided by severe weather, this time by a [[typhoon]] that struck a crushing blow to the Mongolian troops, thwarting the invasion.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kamikaze of 1274 and 1281 {{!}} East Asia, Typhoons {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/kamikaze-of-1274-and-1281 |access-date=2024-01-31 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref>

It was this typhoon that came to be called the ''[[Kamikaze (typhoon)|Kamikaze]]'' (''Divine Wind''), and was the origin of the term [[Kamikaze]] used to indicate [[suicide attacks]] by military aviators of the [[Empire of Japan]] against [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] naval vessels during World War II.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/kamikaze |title=Kamikaze Pilots & Aircraft |date=December 27, 2023  |access-date=January 9, 2024 |archive-date=April 5, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230405111035/https://www.britannica.com/topic/kamikaze |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Formation of the modern city (1889)===
Fukuoka was formerly the residence of the powerful ''[[daimyō]]'' of [[Chikuzen Province]], and played an important part in the medieval history of Japan. The renowned temple of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] in the district was destroyed by fire during the [[Boshin War]] of 1868. <!--(Adapted ''from [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.)-->

The modern city was formed on April 1, 1889, with the merger of the former cities of [[Hakata-ku, Fukuoka|Hakata]] and Fukuoka. Historically, Hakata was the port and merchant district, and was more associated with the area's culture and remains the main commercial area today. On the other hand, the Fukuoka area was home to many samurai, and its name has been used since [[Kuroda Nagamasa]], the first ''daimyō'' of Chikuzen Province, named it after his birthplace in [[Okayama Prefecture]]<ref name="fukuoka.lg.jp">{{Cite web |url=http://www.city.fukuoka.lg.jp/promo/english/magazine/sanpo.html |title=A Walk Through History｜FUKUOKA POWER｜Fukuoka City Promotion |access-date=26 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408010136/http://www.city.fukuoka.lg.jp/promo/english/magazine/sanpo.html |archive-date=8 April 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and the "old Fukuoka" is the main shopping district, now called Tenjin.<!--https://museum.city.fukuoka.jp/en/pdf/ccf_history_jp_en.pdf--><ref>{{Cite web |last=touristinjapan |date=2018-05-17 |title=Tenjin Area, shopping heaven in Fukuoka |url=https://www.touristinjapan.com/tenjin-fukuoka/ |access-date=2024-01-31 |website=Tourist in Japan |language=en-US}}</ref>

When Hakata and Fukuoka decided to merge, a meeting was held to decide the name for the new city, and after multiple ties, Fukuoka ultimately was chosen.<ref>{{Cite web |title=福岡市 Hakata Culture vol.4（Fukuoka City or Hakata City？） |url=https://www.city.fukuoka.lg.jp/english/hakataculture/HakataCulture090410_2.html |access-date=2024-01-31 |website=www.city.fukuoka.lg.jp}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Mabon |first1=Leslie |last2=Kondo |first2=Kayoko |last3=Kanekiyo |first3=Hiroyuki |last4=Hayabuchi |first4=Yuriko |last5=Yamaguchi |first5=Asako |date=2019-10-01 |title=Fukuoka: Adapting to climate change through urban green space and the built environment? |journal=Cities |volume=93 |pages=273–285 |doi=10.1016/j.cities.2019.05.007 |issn=0264-2751 |pmc=6876680 |pmid=31787795 |quote=In April 1889, the government issued an order for municipalisation, and the towns of Fukuoka and Hakata were merged. ‘Fukuoka’ was chosen as the name for the new city.}}</ref> However, Hakata is still used to refer to the Hakata area of the city and, most famously, to refer to the city's train station, [[Hakata Station]], and [[dialect]], ''[[Hakata dialect|Hakata-ben]]''.

==Geography==
[[File:Fukuoka by Sentinel-2, 2020-05-26.jpg|thumb|Satellite photo of Fukuoka]]
Fukuoka is bordered on three sides by mountains, surrounds [[Hakata Bay]] and opens on the north to the [[Genkai Sea]]. It is located {{cvt|1100.|km|0}} from Tokyo.

The nearest overseas region is [[Busan]] Metropolitan City in Gyeongsang-do, [[South Korea]], and the distance from [[Busan]] is about 180&nbsp;km (112 miles). Fukuoka and Busan are sister cities.

===Climate===
Fukuoka has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa''), hot and humid summers, and relatively mild winters.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.climatestotravel.com/climate/japan/fukuoka |title=Climate – Fukuoka |access-date=May 22, 2018 |archive-date=May 22, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180522180913/https://www.climatestotravel.com/climate/japan/fukuoka |url-status=live }}</ref> The city also sees on average about {{cvt|1600|mm|0}} of precipitation per year, with a stretch of more intense precipitation between the months of June and September.

Along with much of the prefecture, Fukuoka City has a moderate climate with an annual average temperature of {{cvt|16.3|°C|0}}, average humidity of 70% and 1,811 annual sunshine hours. Roughly 40% of the year is cloudy.

Winter temperatures rarely drop below {{cvt|0|°C|0}} and snow cover is rarely seen, though very light snow does fall on many days if not as consistently as on the [[Sea of Japan]] side of [[Honshu]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Japan Meteorological Agency]] |url=http://www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/etrn/view/nml_sfc_ym.php?prec_no=82&prec_ch=%95%9F%89%AA%8C%A7&block_no=47807&block_ch=%95%9F%89%AA&year=&month=&day=&view=a1 |script-title=ja:気象庁 &#124; 平年値（年・月ごとの値） |access-date=21 June 2012 |archive-date=March 2, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302072040/http://www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/etrn/view/nml_sfc_ym.php?prec_no=82&prec_ch=%95%9F%89%AA%8C%A7&block_no=47807&block_ch=%95%9F%89%AA&year=&month=&day=&view=a1 |url-status=live }}</ref> Spring is warm and sunnier, with [[cherry blossom]]s appearing in late March or early April. The [[rainy season]] (''tsuyu'') lasts for approximately six weeks through June and July, during which time the humidity is very high and temperatures hover between {{cvt|25|°C|0}} and {{cvt|30|°C|0}}. Summers are humid and hot, with temperatures peaking around {{cvt|37|°C|0}}. Autumn, often considered to be Fukuoka's best season, is mild and dry, though the [[typhoon]] season runs between August and September.

===Disaster===
====Earthquakes====
{{main|2005 Fukuoka earthquake}}

Fukuoka is not as seismically active as many other parts of Japan, but does experience occasional earthquakes. The most powerful recent earthquake registered a lower 6 of maximum 7 of the [[Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale|Japanese intensity scale]] and hit at 10:53&nbsp;am local time on March 20, 2005, killing one person and injuring more than 400.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.earthquaketrack.com/p/japan/fukuoka/biggest |title=Biggest Earthquakes Near Fukuoka, Japan |access-date=May 22, 2018 |archive-date=May 22, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180522111606/https://www.earthquaketrack.com/p/japan/fukuoka/biggest |url-status=live }}</ref> The epicentre of the earthquake was in the Genkai Sea along a yet-undiscovered extension of the Kego fault that runs through the centre of Fukuoka. Genkai island, a part of [[Nishi-ku, Fukuoka|Nishi-ku]], was the most severely damaged by the earthquake and almost all island residents were forced to evacuate. [[Aftershock]]s continued intermittently throughout the following weeks as construction crews worked to rebuild damaged buildings throughout the city. Traditional Japanese houses, particularly in the areas of Daimyo and Imaizumi, were the most heavily damaged and many were marked for demolition, along with several apartment buildings. Insurance payments for damages were estimated at 15.8&nbsp;billion yen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ncmro.org/news/news_03.htm |script-title=ja:地震保険について |publisher=Nongovernmental crisis Management & Regeneration Organization (NPO) |access-date=November 9, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106154408/http://ncmro.org/news/news_03.htm |archive-date=January 6, 2009 |url-status=dead}}".</ref>

A similar quake, with an intensity of 5+, also occurred one month later on April 20, 2005.

Fukuoka's major Kego fault runs northwest to southeast, roughly parallel to [[Nishi-Nippon Railroad|Nishitetsu's]] [[Tenjin Ōmuta Line|Ōmuta]] train line, and was previously thought to be {{cvt|22|km|0}} long. It is estimated to produce earthquakes as strong as [[Richter magnitude scale|magnitude]] 7 at the focus approximately once every 15,000 years. If the focus were located at a depth of {{cvt|10|km|0}}, this would translate to an earthquake of a lower-6 magnitude (similar to the March 20, 2005 earthquake) in downtown Fukuoka if it were the epicenter. The [[probability]] of an earthquake along the known length of the Kego fault occurring within 30 years was estimated at 0.4% prior to the March 20, 2005 earthquake, but this probability has been revised upwards since. Including the new extension out into the [[Genkai Sea]], the Kego fault is now thought to be {{cvt|40|km|0}} long.

Following reports that the city has only prepared for earthquakes up to a magnitude of 6.5, several strong aftershocks renewed fears regarding the portion of the Kego fault that lies under the city, and the potential for an earthquake as big as, or bigger than, the March 20 quake.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Miyashita |first1=Y. |last2=Azuma |first2=T. |last3=Nikaido |first3=M. |last4=Okazaki |first4=K. |date=2006-12-01 |title=Evaluating Earthquake Potential Caused by the Active Kego Fault Beneath the Largest Urban Area in Southwest Japan Based on the Paleoseismological Surveys |url=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AGUFM.T33A0498M |journal=AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts |volume=2006 |pages=T33A–0498|bibcode=2006AGUFM.T33A0498M }}</ref>

The Buddhist [[Nanzo-in|Nanzoin temple]] is located in [[Sasaguri, Fukuoka|Sasaguri]], just east of Fukuoka. It is claimed to be the largest statue of a [[reclining Buddha]] in the world. It has to be mentioned though that in Thailand there are three, and in Myanmar six reclining Buddha statues that are larger than the Sasaguri statue, one of them being 180 meters long as opposed to the 42 meters of the one in Fukuoka prefecture. It is possible though that the Sasaguri reclining Buddha is the largest plastic reclining Buddha statue in the world.

Participants all wear ''shimekomi'' (called ''[[fundoshi]]'' in other parts of Japan), which are traditional loincloths.

Each day of the two-week festival is marked by special events and practice runs, culminating in the official race that takes place the last morning before dawn. Tens of thousands line the streets to cheer on the teams. During the festival, men can be seen walking around many parts of Fukuoka in long ''[[happi]]'' coats bearing the distinctive mark of their team affiliation and traditional ''[[geta (footwear)|geta]]'' sandals. The costumes are worn with pride and are considered appropriate wear for even formal occasions, such as weddings and cocktail parties, during the festival.
