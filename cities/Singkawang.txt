'''Singkawang''' ([[Dayak language|Dayak Salako]]: ''Sakawokng''),  or '''San-Khew-Jong''' ({{lang-zh|c=山口洋|p=Shānkǒuyáng}}; [[Pha̍k-fa-sṳ]]: {{transl|hak|Sân-gú-yòng}}), is a coastal city and port located in the province of [[West Kalimantan]], on the island of [[Borneo]] in [[Indonesia]]. It is located at about 145&nbsp;km north of [[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]], the provincial capital, and is surrounded by the Pasi, Poteng, and Sakkok mountains. Singkawang is derived from the Salako language,<ref>Cite journal |title= |url=https://jurnal.untan.ac.id/index.php/jpdpb/article/view/2038 |journal=Kata Ulang Bahasa Dayak Salako</ref> which refers to  a very wide area of swamps (all swamps). In addition, the ancestors of the Hakka Chinese community in Sakawokng also named this area in Hakka as "San-Khew-Jong" (Mount-Mouth-Sea), which means "A city located at the foot of a mountain near the sea and has a river that flows up to the mouth of the river (estuary)."

The city was created on 21 June 2001 by separation from [[Bengkayang Regency]]. It is bordered to the east and south by Bengkayang Regency, to the west by the South China Sea, and to the north by [[Sambas Regency]]. It covers an area of 504&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and had a population of 186,462 at the 2010 Census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 235,064 at the 2020 Census;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 246,112 (comprising 125,788 males and 120,324 females).<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Singkawang Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.6172)</ref>

==History==
Singkawang ( in chinese : 山口洋 ) name came from one of chinese language ( Hakka language)The word '''"San" (山)''' which means Mountain and Forest, the word '''"Khew" (口)''' which means the mouth of the river, and the word '''"Jong" (洋)''' which means the sea. The miners and traders who came mostly from China, before they headed towards Monterado, first rested in Singkawang, while gold miners from Monterado often rested in Singkawang to remove their tiredness, while Singkawang also served as the transit point for the transportation of gold dust. At that time, they called Singkawang with the word Sakawokng [https://jurnal.untan.ac.id/index.php/jpdpb/article/view/2038 (Salakko Dayak language)], which means a very wide swampy swamp area located on the beach. Dayak Salako are part of the soldiers and intelligence of the Sultanate of Sambas which was given territorial territory in Binua Sarauntung Sakawokng.

Basically the Salako Dayak tribe has long inhabited the Sakawokng area before it became a bustling trading area. The Hakka Chinese who came from South China, who were mostly farmers, traders, and gold miners at that time entered the Sakawokng area through small rivers in the Sado (Sedau) area.  At first, the Singkawang area was still a vast wilderness filled with swamps. Due to its geographical location, the Hakka Chinese immigrants named this area in Hakka as '''"San Khew Jong" (山口洋)'''.

These three syllables really describe the geographical location of Singkawang which is surrounded by mountains and adjacent to the sea and has a river that flows from upstream to downstream and empties into the mouth of the river (estuary). Coincidentally or not, the name San Khew Jong given by the Hakka Chinese immigrants has the same sound and meaning as the name Sakawokng, which was first named by the Salako Dayak ancestors.  This shows that there has been a well-established interaction since time immemorial between the Chinese Hakka community and the indigenous Dayak Salako Sakawokng, especially in terms of language and culture.

==Administrative districts==

==Chinatown==
Besides being well known as the City of Thousands Temples, as there are many small and large temples in any part of the Singkawang region, Singkawang is also known as one of the Indonesian Chinatowns since the majority of the population is of Chinese descent, consisting of mostly [[Hakka people|Hakka]] and some other sub-group of Han Chinese. Theye reside in all areas in the city. They still practice their culture in any ceremony or official events, from weddings to funeral ceremonies. The culture is seen as the closest to the original tradition of Chinese people (mostly refers to [[Hakka]]), making Singkawang known as the Indonesian Chinatown.

==Languages==
Because over 70% of the population of this city is of Chinese Indonesian descent, most people in this city speak Chinese (Hakka). And Singkawang people use [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] as the primary language not only in conversation or trading, but they also use their own mother tongue. As Singkawang consists of three major ethnic groups, [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Malay people|Malay]]s and [[Dayak people|Dayak]], [[Hakka people]], almost all of the Singkawang people use either Indonesian or [[Hakka Chinese]] for conversation; even some members of other ethnic groups use it, too. The Indonesian used in Singkawang commonly for daily conversation is not standard Indonesian, but has some [[Malay language|Malay]] influence on vocabulary as Malay is the closest language to Indonesian and the Singkawang people have for years been accustomed to Malay.

==Transportation==
At present there is no airport at Singkawang, and served by [[Supadio International Airport]]. It is connected by road, can be reached by bus or taxi from Pontianak covering a distance of 150 km. It is also connected by road to [[Kuching]] in [[Malaysia]] via the Aruk/Biawak border and Sambas.

==Mail order bride scandal==
There have been allegations of [[human trafficking]] in Singkawang, based upon the town's mail order bride illegal business.<ref>Indonesia, Etc.: Exploring the Improbable Nation, Elizabeth Pisani, p. 286</ref> Most of the men who travel to Singkawang looking for young women to marry are from [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], [[Mainland China]], or [[Singapore]]. These men arrive and get in touch with brokers, these brokers then approach families with suitably aged daughters and generally offers these parents about 6 million rupiahs (about US$450) for each girl.

It is most normal for a majority of these foreign clients to pay an amount exceedingly more than what is requested by the brokers and most payments are at an average of 30 million rupiahs (about US$2,250). Contracts are often drawn between the brokers and the clients. It is a fact that each contract includes a time period clause and most of these marriages are contractually bound for 2 to 4 years, some for even shorter periods of time. It is also common for these relationships to not be legally bound marriages.

Indonesian police actively arrest the offender of mail order bride.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.antaranews.com/berita/931464/polres-singkawang-gagalkan-pengiriman-warga-yang-diduga-korban-tppo|title=Polres Singkawang gagalkan pengiriman warga yang diduga korban TPPO|date=28 June 2019}}</ref>
