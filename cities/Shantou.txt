However, its built-up (or metro) area is much bigger with 12,543,024 inhabitants including Rongcheng and Jiedong districts, Jiexi county and Puning city in [[Jieyang]] plus all of [[Chaozhou]] city largely conurbated. This is de facto the 5th built-up area in mainland China between [[Hangzhou]]-[[Shaoxing]] (13,035,026 inhabitants), [[Xi'an]]-[[Xianyang]] (12,283,922 inhabitants) and Tianjin (11,165,706 inhabitants).

Shantou, a city significant in 19th-century Chinese history as one of the [[treaty ports]] established for Western trade and contact, was one of the original [[special economic zones of China]] established in the 1980s, but did not blossom in the manner that cities such as [[Shenzhen]], [[Xiamen]] and [[Zhuhai]] did. However, it remains eastern Guangdong's economic centre, and is home to [[Shantou University]], which is under the provincial Project 211 program in Guangdong.

==History==
Shantou was a fishing village part of Tuojiang Du ({{zh|labels=no|t=鮀江都}}), [[Jieyang|Jieyang County]] during the [[Song dynasty]]. It came to be known as Xialing ({{zh|labels=no|t=廈嶺}}) during the [[Yuan dynasty]]. In 1563, Shantou became a part of [[Chenghai District|Chenghai County]] in Chao Prefecture ([[Chaozhou]]). As early as 1574, Shantou had been called Shashanping ({{zh|labels=no|c=沙汕坪}}). In the seventeenth century, a cannon platform called Shashantou Cannon ({{zh|labels=no|t=沙汕頭炮臺}}) was made here, and the place name later was shortened to "Shantou". Locally it has been referred to as Kialat.

Connecting to Shantou across the [[Queshi Bridge]] is Queshi ({{zh|labels=no|t=礐石}}) which had been known by the local people through the 19th century as Kakchio. It was the main site for the American and British consulates. Today the area is a scenic park but some of the structures from its earlier history are somewhat preserved. In 1860, Shantou was opened for foreigners and became a trading port according to [[Treaty of Tientsin]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://finance.sina.com.cn/leadership/mroll/20101020/13598811852.shtml|script-title=zh:汕头1860的记忆_管理滚动新闻_新浪财经_新浪网|work=[[Sina Corp|Sina Finance]]}}</ref>

It became a city in 1919, and was separated from Chenghai in 1921. 1922 saw the devastating [[1922 Swatow Typhoon|Swatow Typhoon]], which killed 5,000 out of the 65,000 people then inhabiting the city.<ref name=MWR>{{cite web | url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/050/mwr-050-08-0433.pdf | author=Willis E.

In the 1930s, as a transport hub and a merchandise distribution centre in Southeast China, Shantou Port's cargo throughput ranked third in the country. A brief account of a visit to the city in English during this period is the English accountant Max Relton's ''A Man in the East: A Journey through French Indo-China'' (Michael Joseph Ltd., London, 1939).

It was ratified by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]] and founded in January 1993, and it formally came into use on December of the same year after its supervision installations were checked and accepted by the [[General Administration of Customs]].

Its goal is to establish a modernized international zone that is open to overseas by drawing experience from international free trade zones.<ref>[http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/shantou-free-trade-zone/ RightSite.asia | Shantou Free Trade Zone]</ref>

==Demographics==
[[File:Guoping Road, Shantou.jpg|thumb|Guoping Road in downtown Shantou, December 2018]]
Shantou is one of the most densely populated regions in China. Former Chaoyang City was China's most populous county-level administrative region, with 2.4&nbsp;million inhabitants.
Shantou has direct jurisdiction over six districts and one county, and the six urban districts of Shantou have a population of 5,330,764.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Nevertheless, its built-up area spread on 11 districts, [[Puning]] city and [[Raoping]] county was home to 12,543,024 inhabitants as of 2020 census.<ref name="citypopulation.de"/>

The Mandarin-medium education system, widely promoted throughout China, has made most people, especially younger generations, speak Mandarin fluently. Cantonese language TV and labor migrations to the Pearl River Delta has also made Cantonese widely spoken as a third language by the younger generations.

Governmental statistics show that 2.16&nbsp;million [[overseas Chinese]] have roots in Shantou, with significant populations of [[Teochew people]] residing in [[Thailand]] and [[Cambodia]], which constitute a majority of [[Thai Chinese]] and a majority of [[Chinese Cambodians]]. This is demonstrated by the unusually high number of international direct flights between [[Bangkok]] and Shantou.
