==History==
[[File:Hollywood Beach during the COVID-19 Pandemic.jpg|thumb|Hollywood Beach during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Florida|COVID-19 pandemic]] in late October 2020,]]
In 1920, [[Joseph Wesley Young House#Joseph Wesley Young|Joseph Young]] arrived in [[South Florida]] to create his own "Dream City in Florida". His vision included the beaches of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] stretching westward with man-made lakes, infrastructure, roads, and the [[Intracoastal Waterway]]. He wanted to include large parks, schools, churches, and golf courses, all industries and activities that were very important to him. After Young spent millions of dollars constructing the city, he was elected its first mayor in 1925. The town quickly became home to northerners known as "[[snowbird (person)|snowbirds]]", who fled the north during the winter and then escaped the south during the summer. By 1960, Hollywood had more than 2,400 hotel units and 12,170 single-family homes.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodfl.org/index.aspx?NID=187|title=Hollywood, FL – Official Website – History of Hollywood|website=hollywoodfl.org|access-date=April 22, 2016}}</ref> Young bought up thousands of acres of land around 1920, and named his new town "Hollywood by the Sea" to distinguish it from his other real-estate venture, "Hollywood in the Hills", in New York.

The [[American Guide Series|Florida guide]], published by the [[Federal Writers' Project]], describes the development of Hollywood, an early example of the [[planned community|planned communities]] that proliferated in Florida during the real-estate boom of the 1920s:
{{Blockquote
|text=During the early days of development here, 1,500 trucks and tractors were engaged in clearing land and grading streets; two yacht basins, designed by General [[George Washington Goethals]], chief engineer in the construction of the [[Panama Canal]], were dredged and connected with the Intracoastal Waterway. A large power plant was installed, and when the city lights went on for the first time, ships at sea reported that Miami was on fire, and their radio alarms and the red glow in the sky brought people to the rescue from miles around.

}}

Prospective purchasers of land were enticed by free hotel accommodation and entertainment, and "were driven about the city-to-be on trails blazed through palmetto thickets; so desolate and forlorn were some stretches that many women became hysterical, it is said, and a few fainted."<ref name="auto" /> Young had a vision of lakes, golf courses, a luxury beach hotel (Hollywood Beach Hotel, now Hollywood Beach Resort), country clubs, and a main street, Hollywood Boulevard.<ref name="Oliver">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zVMhsLpl8JUC|title=Race & Change in Hollywood, Florida|last=Oliver|first=Kitty|date=September 1, 2012|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9781439627655|language=en}}</ref> Hollywood was severely damaged by the [[1926 Miami hurricane]]; local newspapers reported that it was second only to Miami in losses from the storm.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> After Young's death in 1934, the city encountered other destructive hurricanes, and the stock market crashed, causing personal financial misfortunes.<ref name="Oliver" />

[[Hurricane Irma]] hit Florida in 2017, causing damage and power outages in Hollywood. 12 residents of the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills died of heat exposure. Four nursing-home staff were charged with negligence and manslaughter.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ortiz|first=Jorge L.|title='Absolute nightmare': 4 former Florida nursing home staffers charged in 12 Hurricane Irma deaths|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/08/27/florida-nursing-home-hurricane-irma-4-charged-12-deaths/2136076001/|access-date=2021-03-29|website=USA Today |language=en-US}}</ref> Charges were dropped against the 3 nurses<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pipitone • • |first=Tony |date=2022-09-22 |title=Charges Dropped Against Nurses at Hollywood Facility Where 9 Died After Hurricane Irma |url=https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/charges-dropped-against-nurses-at-hollywood-facility-where-9-died-after-hurricane-irma/2864231/ |access-date=2024-03-08 |website=NBC 6 South Florida |language=en-US}}</ref> and the nursing home chief was acquitted.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-02-24 |title=Nursing home chief acquitted in patients' hurricane deaths |url=https://apnews.com/article/hurricanes-and-typhoons-florida-state-government-nursing-homes-3cb1d6abfe80618137101df239dab640 |access-date=2024-03-08 |website=AP News |language=en}}</ref>

The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity created Rebuild Florida, an initiative to provide aid to citizens affected by Irma. Its initial focus was its Housing Repair Program, which offered assistance in rebuilding families' homes. The program prioritized low-income vulnerable residents, such as the disabled, the elderly, and families with children under five.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kennerly |first=Britt |title=Rebuild Florida will help low-income locals make Irma repairs |url=https://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/2018/09/27/low-income-still-need-irma-repairs-rebuild-florida-might-answer/1436973002/ |access-date=2024-03-08 |website=Florida Today |language=en-US}}</ref> The program had varied results across the state, with hundreds of citizens claiming they were left without help.
