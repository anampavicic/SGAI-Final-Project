According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 104,173 people.{{PH census|current}} It is southwest of [[San Fernando, Pampanga|San Fernando]], [[Pampanga]] (the regional center of [[Central Luzon]]) and northwest of [[Manila]] (Philippines' capital city). Balanga joined the [[UNESCO]] Global Network of Learning Cities in 2015.

==Etymology==
The word Balanga originates from the [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]]{{citation needed|date=May 2021}} word "[[balañga]]" (clay pot, or "banga" in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]), which the town used to produce and which were among the best that can be found in the country.

==History==
Balanga was formerly a village of [[Abucay]] before it was established as a mission of the [[Dominican Order]] in the Provincial Charter of April 21, 1714, and later declared a vicariate on April 18, 1739, under the patronage of [[Saint Joseph]]. Upon the establishment of Bataan as a separate province in 1754, Balanga was made its capital by Governor-General [[Pedro Manuel de Arandía Santisteban]] due to its favorable location at the heart of the new territorial jurisdiction.

On December 30, 2000, Balanga was inaugurated as a city by virtue of Republic Act 8984 authored by Congressman [[Tet Garcia|Enrique "Tet" Garcia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofbalanga.gov.ph/city-profile/|title=City Profile – City of Balanga}}</ref>

The city has extended its urban fringe to the west of Roman Superhighway, and a new growth center in Barangay Tuyo has been delineated in the Comprehensive Land Use Plan. During the past years, the city saw a high record of residential growth. Consequently, with the expansion of the physical limits of the urban core, as well as the expected large increases in population, and the city's attractiveness to commercial and employment activities, the City Government of Balanga decided to undertake a Master Planning exercise and to propose various developmental projects that would establish Balanga as a well-planned community with quality and character that is innovative and special, although this is currently hindered by an unreliable electricity supply.<ref>[http://www.nscb.gov.ph/factsheet/pdf01/fs1_01.asp NSCB – 2001 Factsheet – 12 New Cities Created], July–December 2000.</ref>

==Geography==
