Guantánamo is served by the [[Caimanera]] [[port]] near the [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|site of a U.S. naval base]]. The area produces [[sugarcane]] and [[cotton]] wool. These are traditional parts of the economy.

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of Guantánamo}}
The city was founded in 1797<ref name=guije/> in the area of a farm named ''Santa Catalina''. The toponym  "Guantánamo" means, in [[Taíno language]], "land between the rivers".{{citation needed|date=October 2023}}

==Geography==
The municipality is mountainous in the north, at [[Alejandro de Humboldt National Park]], where it overlays the [[Sierra Maestra]] (mountains), and borders the [[Windward Passage]] of the [[Caribbean Sea]] in the south. It is crossed by the Bano, Guantánamo, Yateras, Guaso, San Andrés, and Sabanalamar rivers. The city is spread with a square plan and is crossed in the middle by the [[Carretera Central (Cuba)|Carretera Central]] highway. [[Guantánamo Bay]] is a natural harbour south of it.

The municipality borders with [[El Salvador, Cuba|El Salvador]], [[Niceto Pérez]], [[Caimanera]], [[Yateras]], [[Manuel Tames]], and [[Sagua de Tánamo]]; this one in [[Holguín Province]]. It includes the villages of Argeo Martínez, [[Arroyo Hondo, Cuba|Arroyo Hondo]], Glorieta, [[Las Lajas, Cuba|Las Lajas]], and [[Paraguay, Cuba|Paraguay]].

Prior to 1976 it was divided into the [[barrio]]s and villages [[Arroyo Hondo, Cuba|Arroyo Hondo]], Baitiquirí, Bano, Bayate, [[Caimanera]], Camarones, Caridad, Corralillo, Cuatro Caminos, Filipinas, Glorieta, Gobierno, Guaso, Hospital, Indios, Isleta, Jaibo Abajo, [[Las Lajas, Cuba|Las Lajas]], Macurijes, Mercado, Ocujal, Parroquia, Palma de San Juan, Rastro, Tiguabos, and Vínculo.<ref name=guije>{{Cite web|url=http://www.guije.com/pueblo/municipios/oguantanamo/index.htm|title=Guantánamo|author=Guije.com|access-date=2007-10-05|language=es}}</ref> After 1976 reform part of municipal territory was split in the municipalities of El Salvador, Niceto Pérez, Caimanera, and [[San Antonio del Sur]].{{citation needed|date=October 2023}}

===United States Naval Base===
{{main|Guantánamo Bay Naval Base}}
About 15&nbsp;km away from the city lies the [[Guantánamo Bay]], a superior natural harbor which has been utilized by the [[United States]] since 1898, when it was captured from Spain in the [[Battle of Guantánamo Bay]]. Cuba leased it to the U.S. in 1903 in fulfillment of a commitment made in the 1903 [[Cuban–American Treaty of Relations (1903)|Cuban–American Treaty of Relations]], and remains the site of a [[Guantánamo Bay Naval Base|US Navy base]], as well as the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]].

==Demographics==
In 2022, the municipality of Guantánamo had a population of 222,781.<ref name="citypopulation">{{Cite web |title=Cuba: Administrative Division (Provinces and Municipalities) - Population Statistics, Charts and Map |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/cuba/admin/ |access-date=2024-02-03 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref> With a total area of {{convert|741|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}},<ref name=statoids>{{Cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/ycu.html|title=Municipios of Cuba|author=Statoids| access-date=2007-10-05}}</ref> it has a population density of {{convert|300|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on}}.

===Notable Guantanameros===
Notable natives of Guantánamo include athletes [[Joel Casamayor]], [[Erislandy Lara]], [[Yuriorkis Gamboa]], [[Yumileidi Cumbá]], [[Jaime Jefferson]], [[Yargelis Savigne]], [[Dayron Robles]], [[Luis Delís]], gymnast [[Annia Hatch]], Broadway and movie actress [[Olga Merediz]], musician [[Diamela del Pozo]], cosmonaut [[Arnaldo Tamayo Méndez]], journalist [[Iliana Hernández]] and Major League Baseball player [[Luis Robert Jr.]] of the [[Chicago White Sox]].

==Transport==
===Car===
The city is served by the [[Carretera Central (Cuba)|Carretera Central]] highway, and is the eastern terminus of the [[Autopista A1 (Cuba)|A1 motorway]], that is mainly under construction and will link Guantánamo with [[Havana]]. 
===Railway===
In July 2019, Cuba received its first new train cars in over four decades from China for the route between [[Havana]] and Guantanamo. The journey takes 15 hours. A round trip ticket from Havana to Guantanamo trip starts at 200 Cuban pesos ($8, €7).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/cubas-chinese-made-train-starts-its-first-run/a-49583902|title=Cuba's Chinese-made train starts its first run|website=[[DW.com]]|date=14 July 2019}}</ref>

===Airport===
Guantanamo's commercial airport, the [[Mariana Grajales Airport]], is served by one airline, [[Cubana de Aviacion|Cubana]]. It is located near the villages of Las Lajas and Paraguay.

==The song "Guantanamera"==
{{main|Guantanamera}}

"[[Guantanamera]]" ([[Cuban Spanish|Spanish]]: "from Guantánamo [feminine]", thus "woman from Guantánamo") is perhaps the best known [[Cuba]]n song and that country's most noted patriotic song. In 1966, a version by American vocal group [[The Sandpipers]], based on an [[arrangement]] by [[Pete Seeger]], became an international hit. The song was later also one of Cuban superstar [[Celia Cruz|singer Celia Cruz]]'s biggest hits.
