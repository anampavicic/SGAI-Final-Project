'''Tangier''' ({{IPAc-en|t|√¶|n|Àà|d í|…™…ôr}} {{respell|tan|JEER}}; {{langx|ar|ÿ∑ŸÜÿ¨ÿ©|·π¨anjah}}, {{IPA|ar|tÀ§and ía|}}, {{IPA|ar|tÀ§an ía|}}) or '''Tangiers''' is a city in northwestern [[Morocco]], on the coasts of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The city is the [[capital city|capital]] of the [[Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima]] region, as well as the [[Tangier-Assilah Prefecture]] of Morocco.

Many civilisations and cultures have influenced the history of Tangier, starting from before the 10th century{{nbsp}}BCE. Starting as a strategic [[Phoenicia]]n town and trading centre, Tangier has been a nexus for many cultures. In 1923, it became an [[Tangier International Zone|international zone]] managed by [[colonialism in Africa|colonial powers]] and became a destination for many European and American diplomats, spies, bohemians, writers and businessmen. That status came to an end with [[Moroccan independence]], in phases between 1956 and 1960.

By the early 21st century, Tangier was undergoing rapid development and modernisation. Projects include tourism projects along the bay, a modern business district called Tangier City Centre, an airport terminal, and a football stadium. Tangier's economy is set to benefit greatly from the [[Tanger-Med]] port.{{anchor|Etymology|Name}}

The [[Carthaginian Empire|Carthaginian]] name of the city is variously recorded as {{sc|tng}} ({{langx|xpu|ê§ïê§çê§Ç}}), {{sc|tng æ}} ({{lang|xpu|ê§ïê§çê§Çê§Ä}}), {{sc|tyng æ}} ({{lang|xpu|ê§ïê§âê§çê§Çê§Ä}}),{{sfnp|Ghaki|2015|p=67}} and {{sc|ttg æ}} ({{lang|xpu|ê§ïê§ïê§Çê§Ä}});{{sfnp|Head et al.|1911}} these appear in Greek and Roman sources as '''Tenga''', '''Tinga''', '''Titga''', &c.{{sfnp|''Cath.

[[Latin]] '''[[Tingis]]''' then developed into [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{lang|pt|T√¢nger}}, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{lang|es|T√°nger}}, and [[French language|French]] {{lang|fr|Tanger}}, which entered English as ''Tangier'' and ''Tangiers''. The [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and modern Berber name of the town is ''·π¨anjah'' ({{lang|ar|ÿ∑ŸéŸÜÿ¨ÿ©}}, {{lang|ber|‚µü‚¥∞‚µè‚¥µ‚¥∞}}).{{sfnp|''Cath. Enc.''|1913}}

Moroccan historian [[Ahmed Toufiq]] considers that the name "Tingi" has the same etymology as ''[[Tinghir]]'', and is composed of "Tin", which is a feminine particle that could be translated as "owner" or "she who has", and "gi" which may have originally been "ig", meaning "high location". This corresponds to the popular Moroccan phrase ''Tanja l-…õalya'' (Tangier the High), which may be a remnant echo of the original meaning, as well as a reference to the high location of Tangier. A similar construction can be found in the name of ''[[Tinmel]]'', the first capital of the [[Almohads]], which is composed of "Tin", and "Amlel" meaning "at foot of the mountain" or "at a low location".<ref name="taouf">{{Cite book|title=ŸÅŸä ÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ∫ÿ±ÿ®|year=2019|author=Ahmed Toufiq|language=ar|url=https://archive.org/details/some_pages/109889101_1666374716855022_7762441311513899932_n.jpg|trans-title=On the History of Morocco}}</ref>

Tangier was formally known as {{nowrap|'''Colonia Julia Tingi'''}} ("The [[Julia (gens)|Julian]] Colony of Tingis") following its elevation to [[Roman colonia|colony status]] during the [[Roman Empire]]. The nicknames "Bride of the North" and "Door of Africa" reference its position in far northwestern Africa near the [[Strait of Gibraltar]].

Tangier was founded as a [[Phoenicia]]n [[Phoenician colonies|colony]], possibly as early as the 10th century{{nbsp}}BCE{{sfnp|Hartley|2007|p=345}}<ref name=brad>{{harvp|Davies|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=H4QeOGV_zl4C&pg=PA119 119]}}.</ref> and almost certainly by the 8th century{{nbsp}}BCE.<ref name=sweethomealabama>{{harvp|Roller|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AFpzZfm7WdYC&pg=PT57 34]}}.</ref> The majority of [[Berbers|Berber]] tombs around Tangier had [[Punics|Punic]] jewelry by the 6th century{{nbsp}}BCE, speaking to abundant trade by that time.<ref>{{citation |last=G√≥mez Bellard |first=Carlos |contribution=Rural Landscapes of the Punic World |contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tkwiAQAAIAAJ |date=January 2008 |title=Monographs in Mediterranean Archaeology |number=11 |author2=Peter van Dommelen |display-authors=1 |ref={{harvid|G√≥mez Bellard et al.|2008}} |location=London |publisher=Equinox |at=Ch. 5, p. 17 }}.</ref> The [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] developed it as an important port of [[Carthaginian Empire|their empire]] by the 5th century{{nbsp}}BCE.{{sfnp|Hartley|2007|p=345}}<ref name=brad/> It was probably involved with the expeditions of [[Hanno the Navigator]] along the [[West Africa]]n coast.{{sfnp|Hartley|2007|p=345}}<ref name=sweethomealabama/> The city long preserved its [[Phoenicia]]n traditions, issuing bronze coins under the [[Mauretania]]n kings with [[Punic script]]. Under the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] other coins were issued, bearing [[Augustus]] and [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]]'s heads and Latin script [[obverse]] but an image of the [[Canaanite religion|Canaanite god]] [[Baal]] [[obverse and reverse|reverse]].{{sfnp|Head et al.|1911}} Some editions of [[Procopius]] place his Punic [[Stele|stelae]] in Tingis rather than [[Tigisis in Numidia|Tigisis]];{{sfnp|Meakin|1899|p=[https://archive.org/details/moorishempireah02meakgoog/page/n40 10]}} in either case, however, their existence is highly dubious.{{sfnp|Amitay|2011}}

The Greeks knew this town as [[Tingis]] and, with [[interpretatio graeca|some modification]], record the [[Berber mythology|Berber legends]] of its founding. Supposedly [[Tinjis]], daughter of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] and widow of [[Antaeus]], slept with [[Hercules]] and bore him the son [[Sufax|Syphax]]. After Tinjis' death, Syphax then founded the port and named it in her honour.<ref name=plu>{{citation |author=L.

Tingis came under the control of the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] ally [[Mauretania]] during the [[Punic Wars]]. [[Quintus Sertorius|Q. Sertorius]], in [[Sertorian War|his war]] against [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]]'s [[Constitutional reforms of Sulla|regime in Rome]], took and held Tingis for a number of years in the 70s{{nbsp}}BCE. It was subsequently returned to the Mauretanians but established as a [[republic]]an [[Free city (classical antiquity)|free city]] during the reign of [[Bocchus III of Mauretania|Bocchus{{nbsp}}III]] in 38{{nbsp}}BCE.{{sfnp|L√©vi-Proven√ßal|1936|p=650}}

Tingis received certain municipal privileges under [[Augustus]] and became a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Roman colonia|colony]] under [[Claudius]], who made it the provincial capital of [[Mauretania Tingitana]].{{sfnp|''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica''|1878}}{{sfnp|''Cath.

Under the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], Tangier served as the capital of the Moroccan district (''Maghreb al-Aqsa''<ref name=bad/> or ''al-Udwa'') of the [[Ifriqiya|province of Africa]] (''Ifriqiya''). The conquest of the Maghreb and Spain had, however, been undertaken principally as raids for [[Slavery in Islam|slaves]] and plunder and the caliphate's leadership continued to treat all Berbers as pagans or slaves for [[jizya|tax purposes]], even after their wholesale conversion to Islam.<ref name=brett>{{harvp|Brett|2017|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8C1WDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA193 193]}}.</ref> In the area around Tangier, these hateful taxes were mostly paid in female slaves or in tender [[Lambskin (sheepskin)|lambskin]]s obtained by beating the ewes to induce [[premature birth]].<ref name=brett/> [[Yazid ibn Abi Muslim|Governor Yazid]] was murdered by Berber guards whom he had tattooed as slaves in {{c.|720}},<ref name=brett/> and in the 730s similar treatment from [[Ubayd Allah ibn al-Habhab|Governor Ubayd Allah]] and [[Omar ibn Abd Allah al-Muradi|al-Muradi]], his deputy at Tangier, provoked the [[Berber Revolt]]. Inspired by the egalitarian [[Kharijite]] heresy, [[Barghawata]] and others under [[Maysara al-Matghari]] seized Tangier in the summer of 740.{{sfnp|Ilahiane|2010|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aRYuDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA47 s.v.

An enraged [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik|Caliph Hisham]] ordered an attack from a second army "whose beginning is where they are and whose end is where I am," but this army was [[Battle of Bagdoura|defeated at Bagdoura]] the next year.{{sfnp|Blankinship|1994|pp=208‚Äì9}} The Barghawata were concentrated further south on the Atlantic coast, and area around Tangier fell into chaos until 785.{{sfnp|L√©vi-Proven√ßal|1936|p=651}}

The [[Zaidiyyah|Shia]] Arab refugee [[Idris I of Morocco|Idris]] arrived at Tangier{{sfnp|L√©vi-Proven√ßal|1936|p=651}} before moving further south, marrying into local tribes around [[Moulay Idriss]] and assembling an army that, among [[Idrisids|its other conquests]], took Tangier {{c.|790}}. During the division of the sultanate that occurred on the death of [[Idris II of Morocco|Idris{{nbsp}}II]], Tangier fell to his son [[Qasim ibn Idris|Qasim]] in 829.{{sfnp|L√©vi-Proven√ßal|1936|p=651}} It was soon taken by Qasim's brother [[Umar ibn Idris|Umar]], who ruled it until his death in 835.{{sfnp|L√©vi-Proven√ßal|1936|p=651}} Umar's son [[Ali ibn Umar|Ali]] became sultan (r.{{nbsp}}874‚Äì883), as did Qasim's son [[Yahya ibn al-Qasim|Yahya]] after him (r.{{nbsp}}880‚Äì904), but they governed from [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]].

The [[Fatimids|Fatimid]] caliph [[Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah|Abdullah al-Madhi]] began interfering in Morocco in the early 10th century, prompting [[Abd ar-Rahman III|the Umayyad emir of Cordova]] to proclaim himself caliph and to begin supporting proxies against his rivals. He helped the [[Maghrawa Berbers]] overrun [[Melilla]] in 927, [[Ceuta]] in 931, and Tangier in 949.{{sfnp|L√©vi-Proven√ßal|1936|p=651}} Tangier's governor was subsequently named chief over Cordova's Moroccan possessions and allies.{{sfnp|L√©vi-Proven√ßal|1936|p=651}} [[Ali ibn Hammud al-Nasir|Ali ibn Hammud]], named Cordova's governor for Ceuta in 1013, took advantage of the realm's civil wars to conquer Tangier and [[M√°laga]] before overrunning Cordova itself and proclaiming himself caliph in 1016. His Barghawata ally Riz·∏≥ AllƒÅh was then permitted to rule from Tangier with general autonomy.{{sfnp|L√©vi-Proven√ßal|1936|p=651}}

[[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]] captured Tangier for the [[Almoravids]] in 1077.{{sfnp|L√©vi-Proven√ßal|1936|p=651}} It fell to [[Abd al-Mumin]]'s [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] in the 1147 and then flourished under his dynasty, with its port highly active.{{sfnp|L√©vi-Proven√ßal|1936|p=651}}

Like Ceuta, Tangier did not initially acknowledge the [[Marinids]] after the fall of the Almohads. Instead, the local chief [[Abu 'l-Hadidjadj Yusuf ibn Muhammad ibn al-Amir al-Hamdani|Yusuf ibn Muhammad]] pledged himself to the [[Hafsids]] in Tunisia and then to the [[Abbasids]] in the east before being killed in {{sc|ah}}{{nbsp}}665 (late 1266 or early 1267).{{sfnp|L√©vi-Proven√ßal|1936|p=651}} [[Abu Yusuf Yaqub ibn Abd al-Haqq|Abu Yusuf Yaqub]] compelled Tangier's allegiance with a three months' siege in 1274.{{sfnp|L√©vi-Proven√ßal|1936|p=651}}

The next century was an obscure time of rebellions and difficulties for the city. During this time, the traveler [[Ibn Battuta]] was born in Tangier in 1304, leaving home at 20 for the [[hajj]].{{sfnp|Ilahiane|2010|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aRYuDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA99 s.v.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Tangier|Tangier Free Zone|Tanger-Med}}
[[File:Habour of Tanger Morocco.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Port of Tangier|alt=The Port of Tangier harbor]]
[[File:Marktst√§nde in der Medina.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Street in Tangier's Medina ("Old City")]]
Tangier is Morocco's second most important industrial centre after [[Casablanca]]. The industrial sectors are diversified: [[textile]], [[chemical]], [[wikt:mechanical|mechanical]], [[metallurgical]] and [[naval]]. Currently, the city has four [[industrial park]]s of which two have the status of [[free economic zone]] (see [[Tangier Free Zone]]).

Tangier's economy relies heavily on [[tourism]]. In the 1960s and '70s, Tangier formed part of the [[hippie trail]].<ref name="brad2">{{harvp|Davies|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=H4QeOGV_zl4C&pg=PA120 120]}}.</ref> It became less popular and tourist attractions became run-down as cheap flights made central Moroccan cities like [[Marrakesh]] more accessible to European tourists; crime rose and a somewhat dangerous reputation drove more tourists away.<ref name="brad2" /> Since 2010, however, [[Mohammed VI of Morocco|King Mohammed{{nbsp}}VI]] has made a point of restoring the city's shipping and tourist facilities and improving its industrial base. Among other improvements, the beach was cleaned and lined with new cafes and clubs; the new commercial port means [[cruise ship]]s no longer unload beside cargo containers.<ref name="brad2" />

Seaside resorts have been increasing with projects funded by foreign investments. [[Real estate]] and [[construction]] companies have been investing heavily in tourist infrastructures. A bay delimiting the city centre extends for more than {{convert|7|km|0|abbr=on}}. The years 2007 and 2008 were particularly important for the city because of the completion of large construction projects; these include the Tangier-Mediterranean port ("[[Tanger-Med]]") and its industrial parks, a 45,000-seat sports stadium, an expanded business district, and renovated tourist infrastructure.

Tanger-Med, a new port {{convert|40|km|abbr=on|0}} outside Tangier proper, began construction in 2004 and became functional in 2007. Its site plays a key role in connecting maritime regions, as it is in a very critical position on the Strait of Gibraltar, which passes between Europe and Africa. The makeup of the new port is 85% transhipment 15% for domestic import and export activities.<ref>C√©sar Ducruet, Fatima Mohamed-Ch√©rif, Najib Cherfaoui. Maghreb Port Cities in Transition: The Case of Tangier (n.d.): n. pag. Web.</ref> The port is distinguished by its size, infrastructure, and efficiency in managing the flow of ships. Tanger-Med has linked Morocco to Europe's freight industry. It has also helped connect Morocco to countries in the Mediterranean, Africa, and America. The port has allowed Tangier to become a more globalised city with new international opportunities that will help facilitate economic growth.<ref>Ouail El Im Rani Et Al., International Journal of Research in Management, Economics and Commerce, ISSN 2250-057X, Impact Factor: 6.384, Volume 06 Issue 07, July 2016, Page 73-81. Tangier Med Port: What Role for the Moroccan Economy and the International Trade? (n.d.): n. page. Web.</ref> The construction and operation of the port aimed to create 120,000 new jobs, 20,000 at the port and 100,000 resulting from growing economic activity.

[[Agriculture]] in the area of Tangier is tertiary and mainly cereal. The city is chiefly famed for [[tangerine]]s, a kind of [[mandarin orange]] hybrid first grown in the orchards then once south of the [[Medina quarter|medina]], but it was never commonly exported. As early as 1900, local consumption had already outstripped supply and required imports from [[Tetuan]] and elsewhere.<ref name=inthemidnighthour>{{harvp|Meakin|1901|p=[https://archive.org/stream/landofmoorscompr00meak/landofmoorscompr00meak#page/107/mode/1up 107]}}.</ref> Mass farming of tangerines instead began in [[Florida]] in the [[United States]], where the first tree was introduced at [[Palatka, Florida|Palatka]] by a Major Atway sometime before 1843.{{sfnp|Hume|1913|p=101}}

Artisanal trade in the medina ("Old City") specialises mainly in [[leather working]], handicrafts made from wood and silver, traditional clothing, and Moroccan-style shoes.

The city has grown quickly due to [[rural exodus]] from other smaller cities and villages. The 2014 population is more than three-times larger than 32 years ago (850.000 inhabitants in 2014 vs. 250,000 in 1982).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} This phenomenon has resulted in the appearance of peripheral suburban districts, mainly inhabited by poor people, that often lack sufficient infrastructure.

In 2023 Tangier hosted the [[Connect (aviation forum)|Connect route development forum]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Greenbank |first1=Chloe |title=Airports and airlines connect in Tangier |url=https://www.regionalgateway.net/connect-2023-airports-and-airlines-gather-in-tangier/ |access-date=28 March 2023 |work=Regional Gateway |date=22 February 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Tourism: Morocco's big bet for 2023 |url=https://atalayar.com/en/content/tourism-moroccos-big-bet-2023 |work=Atalayar |language=en}}</ref>

The old town is still surrounded by the remains of what was once more than {{convert|2000|yd|m ft|0|order=out}} of stone rampart. Most of it dates to the town's Portuguese occupation, with restoration work later undertaken at different times.

==Transport==
[[File:Al Boraq RGV2N2 at Tanger Ville.jpg|thumb|[[Al Boraq]] at the [[Tanger-Ville Railway Terminal]]]]
[[Rail transport|Railway]] lines connect [[Tanger-Ville railway station]] with [[Rabat]], [[Casablanca]] and [[Marrakesh]] in the south, and with [[Fes]] and [[Oujda]] in the east. The service is operated by [[ONCF]]. In November 2018 Africa's first high-speed train, the [[Kenitra‚ÄìTangier high-speed rail line]], was inaugurated, linking Tangier to [[Casablanca]] in 2 hours, 10 minutes. By 2020 improvements between Casablanca and [[Kenitra]] are planned to further reduce the journey to 1 hour and 30 minutes.

The [[Rabat‚ÄìTangier expressway]] connects Tangier to [[Fes]] via Rabat {{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}}, and [[Settat]] via Casablanca {{convert|330|km|0|abbr=on}} and [[Tanger-Med]] port. The [[Ibn Batouta International Airport]] (formerly known as Tangier-Boukhalef) is {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} south-west of the city centre.

The new [[Tanger-Med]] port is managed by the Danish firm [[A. P. Moller‚ÄìMaersk Group]] and will free up the old port for tourist and recreational development.

Tangier's [[Tangier Ibn Battouta Airport|Ibn Batouta International Airport]] and the rail tunnel will serve as the gateway to the Moroccan Riviera, the littoral area between Tangier and Oujda. Traditionally, the northern coast was a rural stronghold, with some of the best beaches on the [[Mediterranean]]. It is slated for rapid urban development. The Ibn Batouta International Airport has been modernised to accommodate more flights. The biggest airline at the airport is [[Royal Air Maroc]].

==Education==
Tangier offers four types of education systems: Arabic, French, Spanish and English. Each offers classes starting from pre-Kindergarten up to the 12th grade, as for German in the three last years of high school. The ''[[Baccalaur√©at]]'', or [[high school diploma]] are the diplomas offered after clearing the 12 grades.

Many universities are inside and outside the city. Universities like the Institut Sup√©rieur International de Tourisme (ISIT), which grants diplomas, offer courses ranging from [[business administration]] to [[hotel]] [[management]]. The institute is one of the most prestigious [[tourism]] schools in the country. Other colleges such as the √âcole Nationale de Commerce et de Gestion ([http://www.encgt.ma ENCG-T]) is among the biggest [[business school]]s in the country as well as √âcole Nationale des Sciences appliqu√©es ([http://www.ensat.ac.ma ENSA-T]), a rising [[engineering school]] for applied sciences. University known as Abdelmaled Essaadi holding many what they mainly known as faculties; Law, Economics and Social sciences ([http://www.fdtanger.ma FSJEST]) and the FST of Technical Sciences. and the most attended Institut of ISTA of the OFPPT.

===Primary education===
There are more than a hundred Moroccan [[primary school]]s, dispersed across the city. Private and public schools, they offer education in Arabic, French and some school English until the 5th grade. Mathematics, Arts, Science Activities and nonreligious modules are commonly taught in the primary school.

When [[Charles-Edgar de Mornay|Count de Mornay]] traveled to Morocco in 1832 to establish a treaty supportive of the recent [[French conquest of Algeria|French annexation of Algeria]], he took along the [[Romanticism#Visual arts|Romantic painter]] [[Eug√®ne Delacroix]]. Delacroix not only reveled in the [[orientalism]] of the place; he also took it as a new and living model for his works on [[classical antiquity]]: "The Greeks and Romans are here at my door, in the Arabs who wrap themselves in a white blanket and look like Cato or Brutus..."<ref>{{citation |author=[[Eug√®ne Delacroix]] |display-authors=0 |editor-last=Wellington |editor-first=Hubert |title=The Journal of Eug√®ne Delacroix |publisher=Cornell University Press |date=1980 |page=xv }}.</ref> He sketched and painted watercolours continuously, writing at the time "I am like a man in a dream, seeing things he fears will vanish from him." He returned to his sketches and memories of North Africa for the rest of his career, with 80 oil paintings like ''The Fanatics of Tangier'' and ''[[Women of Algiers]]'' becoming legendary and influential on artists such as [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]], and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]. They were particularly struck by the quality of the light: to [[Paul C√©zanne|C√©zanne]], "All this luminous colour... seems... that it enters the eye like a glass of wine running into your gullet and it makes you drunk straight away".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/feb/05/damned-souls-decadence-eugene-delacroix-hero |title=Damnation, Dante and Decadence: Why Eug√®ne Delacroix is making a hero's return|last1=Prodger|first1=Michael |date=5 February 2016 |website=The Guardian |access-date=30 April 2016}}</ref> Tangier subsequently became an obligatory stop for artists seeking to experience the colours and light he spoke of for themselves‚Äîwith varying results. [[Matisse]] made several sojourns in Tangier, always staying at the Grand Hotel Villa de France. "I have found landscapes in Morocco," he claimed, "exactly as they are described in Delacroix's paintings." His students in turn had their own; the Californian artist [[Richard Diebenkorn]] was directly influenced by the haunting colours and rhythmic patterns of Matisse's Morocco paintings.

The multicultural placement of [[Muslim]], [[Christians|Christian]] and [[Jewish]] communities and the foreign immigrants attracted writer [[George Orwell]], writer and composer [[Paul Bowles]], playwright [[Tennessee Williams]], the beat writers [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Jack Kerouac]], the painter [[Brion Gysin]] and the music group the [[Rolling Stones]], who all lived in or visited Tangier during different periods of the 20th century.

In the 1940s and until 1956 when the city was an [[International Zone]], the city served as a playground for eccentric millionaires, a meeting place for [[Espionage|secret agents]] and a variety of crooks and a mecca for speculators and gamblers, an Eldorado for the fun-loving "Haute Vol√©e". During the [[Second World War]] the [[Office of Strategic Services]] operated out of Tangier for various operations in North Africa.<ref>[http://www.legation.org/public_html/relate.htm The American Legation at Tangier, Morocco] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124225147/http://www.legation.org/public_html/relate.htm |date=January 24, 2008 }}</ref>

Around the same time, a circle of writers emerged which was to have a profound and lasting literary influence. This included [[Paul Bowles]], who lived and wrote for over half a century in the city, [[Tennessee Williams]] and [[Jean Genet]] as well as [[Mohamed Choukri]] (one of [[North Africa]]'s most controversial and widely read authors), [[Abdeslam Boulaich]], [[Larbi Layachi]], [[Mohammed Mrabet]] and [[Ahmed Yacoubi]]. Among the best known works from this period is Choukri's ''For Bread Alone''. Originally written in Classical Arabic, the English edition was the result of close collaboration with Bowles (who worked with Choukri to provide the translation and supplied the introduction). [[Tennessee Williams]] described it as "a true document of human desperation, shattering in its impact." Independently, [[William S. Burroughs]] lived in Tangier for four years and wrote ''[[Naked Lunch]]'', whose locale of [[Interzone (book)|Interzone]] is an allusion to the city.

After several years of gradual disentanglement from Spanish and French colonial control, Morocco reintegrated the city of Tangier at the signing of the [[Tangier Protocol]] on 29 October 1956. Tangier remains a very popular tourist destination for cruise ships and day visitors from [[Spain]] and [[Gibraltar]].

===Language===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2021}}
Most of the inhabitants of Tangier speak a very distinctive variety of [[Moroccan Arabic]] which differs from other Darija counterparts. The difference resides in pronunciation, tempo, grammar and a unique vocabulary. Arabic is used in government documentation and on road signs together with French. French is taught in primary schools and high schools and used in universities and large businesses. Spanish is well understood and spoken fluently, mainly exclusively by Tangierian locals. English, on the other hand, has been and still is used in tourist sectors.

The autochthonous population of Tangier has been declining drastically since the mid-2000s, as many locals, especially those from the younger generations, have moved to nearby Spain. While the industrial sector is expanding constantly, the internal immigration from the south to north is increasing rapidly. As a consequence, the Tangierian dialect is losing its distinctiveness or is being altered (in a recent study, social media has been depicted as one of these factors).

Nowadays, the Tangierian dialect is less prominent in public places, with the southern Darija dialect being more common in the area, to the extent that some observers question if Tangier retains its identity as it was before.

===Religion===
[[File:Cattan_1.jpg|thumb|[[Church of the Immaculate Conception (Tangier)|The Catholic Cathedral of Tangier]]]]
Due to its Christian past before the Muslim conquest, it remains a [[titular see]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].{{sfnp|''Cath. Enc.''|1913}} Originally, the city was part of the larger Roman province of [[Mauretania Caesariensis]], which included much of North Africa. Later the area was subdivided, with the eastern part keeping the former name and the newer part receiving the name of [[Mauretania Tingitana]]. It is not known exactly at what period there may have been an episcopal see at Tangier in ancient times, but in the Middle Ages Tangier was used as a [[titular see]] (i.e., an honorific fiction for the appointment of curial and auxiliary bishops), placing it in Mauretania Tingitana. For the historical reasons given above, one official list of the [[Roman Curia]] places the see in Mauretania Caesarea.

Towards the end of the 3rd century, Tangier was the scene of the martyrdoms of [[Marcellus of Tangier|St.{{nbsp}}Marcellus]], mentioned in the [[Roman Martyrology]] on 30 October, and of [[Cassian of Tangier|St.{{nbsp}}Cassian]], mentioned on 3 December.{{sfnp|''Cath. Enc.''|1913}}

Under the Portuguese, the [[Diocese of Tanger|diocese of Tangier]] was a [[suffragan]] of [[Patriarchate of Lisbon|Lisbon]] but, in 1570, it was united with the [[diocese of Ceuta]]. Six Bishops of Tangier from this period are known, the first{{mdash}}who did not reside in his see{{mdash}}in 1468. During the era of the French and Spanish protectorates over Morocco, Tangier was the residence of the [[Prefect Apostolic]] of Morocco, the mission having been founded on 28 November 1630 and entrusted to the [[Friars Minor]]. At the time, it had a Catholic church, several chapels, schools and a hospital. The Prefecture Apostolic was raised to the status of [[Vicar Apostolic of Marocco|Vicariate Apostolic]] of Morocco on 14 April 1908. On 14 November 1956, it became the [[Archbishop of Tangier|Archdiocese of Tangier]].<ref>''Annuario Pontificio'' 2010, p. 721</ref>
[[File:Moroccan Christians from Tangier.jpg|thumb|right|Moroccan Christians from Tangier.]]

===Sport===
Tangierians regard football as the primary entertainment when it comes to sport-material. There are several football fields around the city. Tangier would have been one of the host cities for the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations]] football tournament, which would be played at the new [[Ibn Batouta Stadium]] and in other cities across Morocco, until Morocco was banned from participating the [[Africa Cup of Nations]] due to their denial.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110201184029/http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid=1373321.html Morocco then South Africa to host Cups]. FIFA.com (2011-01-29). Retrieved on 2011-06-04.</ref> Instead Tangier will host matches for the [[2025 Africa Cup of Nations|2025 edition]] after Guinea withdraw from hosting. It could also host matches for the [[2030 FIFA World Cup]].

Basketball comes the second most practised sport in Tangier. The city is known for their local teams IRT, Ajax Tanger, Juventus Tangier and so on.

[[National Cricket Stadium, Tangier|National Cricket Stadium]] is the only top-class cricket stadium in [[Morocco]]. Stadium hosted its first International Tournament from 12 to 21 August 2002. [[Pakistan cricket team|Pakistan]], [[South Africa cricket team|South Africa]] and [[Sri Lanka cricket team|Sri Lanka]] competed in a 50-overs one day [[2002 Morocco Cup|triangular series]]. The [[International Cricket Council]] has granted international status to the Tangier Cricket Stadium, official approval that will allow it to become [[North Africa]]'s first international cricket venue.

=== Museums ===
The [[American Legation, Tangier|Museum of the American Legation]], whose building was granted to the United States in 1821 by the Sultan Moulay Suliman served as a consulate of the United States and a later legation, as well as a high traffic post for the intelligence agents of the Second World War and a Peace Corps training facility. Today, its courtyards and narrow corridors serve as an elaborate museum that demonstrates relations between the United States and Morocco and the Moroccan heritage, including a wing dedicated to [[Paul Bowles]], where you can see the documents and photographs of the writer donated to the museum by the gallerist and friend of the writer [[Gloria Kirby]] in 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.paulbowles.org/paulbowlesmuseum.html|title=PAUL BOWLES WING: Tangier American Legation (TALIM)|website=www.paulbowles.org|access-date=2019-03-27|archive-date=2019-12-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191227150201/http://www.paulbowles.org/paulbowlesmuseum.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Espionage====

Tangier has been reputed as a [[safe house]] for international [[spying]] activities.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pennell |first=C. R. |title=Morocco since 1830: A History |year=1999 |publisher=New York University Press |isbn=978-1-85065-426-1 |page=257 |chapter=Wars: The Second World War in Morocco }}</ref> Its position during the [[Cold War]] and during other spying periods of the 19th and 20th centuries is legendary.

Tangier acquired the reputation of a spying and smuggling centre and attracted foreign capital due to political neutrality and commercial liberty at that time. It was via a British bank in Tangier that the [[Bank of England]] in 1943 for the first time obtained samples of the high-quality forged British currency produced by the Nazis in "[[Operation Bernhard]]".

The city has also been a subject for many [[spy fiction]] books and films.
