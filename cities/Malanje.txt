==History==

===Portuguese rule===
Portuguese settlers founded Malanje in the 19th century. The construction of the railway from [[Luanda]] to Malanje, in the fertile highlands, started in 1885. The area around Malanje included [[Portuguese West Africa]]'s primary areas dedicated to the production of [[cotton]], the crop that drove its development since the beginning. The town developed in the mid-19th century as [[Slavery in Angola|an important slave market created in 1852]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://repositorio.uportu.pt/jspui/bitstream/11328/2282/1/Hist%C3%B3ria%20econ%C3%B3mico-social%20de%20Angola%20do%20per%C3%ADodo%20pr%C3%A9-colonial%20%C3%A0%20independ%C3%AAncia.pdf|title=História económico-social de Angola: do período pré-colonial à independência|website=[[University of Porto]]|language=pt|access-date=16 December 2021}}</ref> Situated at an elevation of {{convert|1,134|m}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dateandtime.info/citycoordinates.php?id=2239862 |title=Geographic coordinates of Malanje, Angola |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2015 |website=dateandtime.info  |publisher=dateandtime.info  |access-date=7 September 2015}}</ref> the town has a high-altitude tropical climate, ideal to several agricultural productions. The city developed as an important agricultural, manufacturing, trading and services centre. Its productions included [[cotton]], [[textiles]], [[coffee]], [[fruit]] and [[Maize|corn]]. The [[Cangandala National Park]] was established by the Portuguese authorities in 1970, having previously been classified as an Integral Natural Reserve in 1963.

===After independence from Portugal===
The withdrawal of the Portuguese in conjunction with Angola's independence in 1975, and, later, the [[Angolan Civil War]] (1975–2002), severely hampered the production of [[cotton]] as well as that of [[coffee]] and corn (maize). Malanje was partially destroyed during the civil war, but reconstruction efforts in the years following the end of the conflict have rebuilt the city and its surroundings.

==Landmarks==
Near the city is the [[Cangandala National Park]], established by the Portuguese authorities on 25 June 1970, it was founded to protect the [[Giant Sable Antelope]] which were discovered in 1963. As far as religious buildings are concerned, there is the Evangelical Church at Quêssua and as for funerary constructions, the Tomb of the queen [[Ana de Sousa Nzinga Mbande]] and the tomb of [[José do Telhado]], a local Robin Hood. José do Telhado was a Portuguese who was exiled to [[Portuguese Angola]] that in colonial days used to steal from rich whites and distribute to poor blacks. Worth visiting is the Forte de Cabatuquila in the city.

==Transportation==
[[File:Malange Estacao-CfL 2011-08 IMG1487.jpg|thumb|right|Railway station of Malanje]]

===Airport===
[[Malanje Airport]] was built during the colonial era. Currently, there are no flights to the capital [[Luanda]].

===Railway===
The construction of the [[Luanda Railway|railway]] from [[Luanda]] to Malanje, in the fertile highlands, started in 1885. After the end of the civil war in 2002, it was expected to be the terminus of a railway from the capital city and port of [[Luanda]] once reconstruction was complete.
