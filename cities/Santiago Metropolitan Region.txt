'''Santiago Metropolitan Region''' ({{langx|es|link=no|Región Metropolitana de Santiago}}) is one of [[Chile]]'s 16 first-order [[Administrative divisions of Chile|administrative division]]s. It is the country's only [[landlocked]] administrative [[Regions of Chile|region]] and contains the nation's capital, [[Santiago]]. Most commercial and administrative centers are located in the region, including Chile's main international airport, [[Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport]].

With an area of {{convert|15403.2|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} and population over seven million, it is Chile's most populated and most densely populated region.

==History==
The region's history of European influence started in 1542,<ref name="CINVER-RM"/> a few days after [[Santiago]] was founded. When the Santiago [[cabildo (council)|cabildo]] was built, its function was to supervise the entire territory. Later, with the creation of the cities of [[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]] and [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]] and the creation of their respective cabildos, its territorial reach was reduced.

On 30 August 1826, 8 [[Provinces of Chile|provinces]] were created, with the Santiago Province being one of them, but it wasn't until 1980 that the Metropolitan Region was created.

==Geography==
Metropolitana is Chile's only landlocked region and lies in the [[Intermediate Depression]] valley between the [[Chilean Coast Range]] and the [[Andes mountains]]. [[San Cristóbal Hill|Cerro San Cristóbal]] dominates the sprawling Santiago cityscape at a height of {{convert|880|m|0|abbr=on}} above sea level with city suburbs steadily climbing the foothills of the Andes to the east. The [[Tupungato]] [[stratovolcano]], measures {{convert|6570|m|0|abbr=on}} on the [[Argentina|Argentine]] border, is one of South America's highest peaks.

The dominant drainage basin feeds into the [[Maipo River]]; its main tributaries are the [[Mapocho River|Mapocho]], [[Yeso River|Yeso]] and Colorado rivers.<ref name="CINVER-RM"/>

==Climate and natural features==
{{More citations needed|section|date=July 2023}}
The climate of the Metropolitan Region is temperate Mediterranean cold, of the kind called ''continental''. Precipitation is concentrated in the winter months, generally as snow over 900 m [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and, in colder years, over the city of Santiago. Winter tends to be cold with frequent frosts during which temperature drops below {{convert|0|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The summer months are usually dry and hot. The [[Chilean Coast Range|Cordillera de la Costa]] acts as a climate screen and reduces marine influence, which makes the climate more continental. This situation becomes apparent when comparing precipitation from a coastal location such as [[Valparaíso]] (460&nbsp;mm) with that of Santiago de Chile (360&nbsp;mm).

The annual median precipitation reaches 367&nbsp;mm on average. The annual median temperature comes out to {{convert|13.5|°C|0|abbr=on}}, with a median high of {{convert|21|°C|0|abbr=on}} and a median low of {{convert|6|°C|0|abbr=on}} in urban areas. Rural areas tend to be colder, as temperature reaches {{convert|-10|°C|0|abbr=on}} in the coldest months (July, August)

Most of the region is made up of an extremely fertile, level prairie that the locals call ''la Depresión intermedia'' ([[Intermediate Depression]]). The terrain is known for its low elevation in relation to sea level and for being surrounded by hills, as well as emergent so-called ''island hills'', such as [[Cerro Santa Lucía|Santa Lucía]] (an ancient extinct volcano), Blanco, and [[Cerro Renca|Renca]], present today in the city of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]].

There is some occurrence of the [[endangered]] [[Chilean Wine Palm]], ''[[Jubaea chilensis]]'' within the Santiago Province;<ref>C. Michael Hogan (2008) [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=82831 ''Chilean Wine Palm: Jubaea chilensis'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. Nicklas Stromberg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017013207/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=82831 |date=17 October 2012 }}</ref> this iconic tree of central Chile had a much larger range prehistorically, before the decimation of much of its habitat by the [[Population growth|expanding human population]].

==Economy and culture==
The region's principal industries include manufacturing, services, retail, and financial services. The capital of Santiago serves as the country's administrative, industrial, commercial, financial and cultural center, producing 41.5% of Chile's gross domestic product, according to central bank estimates. The [[Plaza de Armas (Santiago)|Plaza de Armas]], the central square in downtown Santiago, hosts the [[Metropolitan Cathedral of Santiago|city's cathedral]] and city hall. Eight city blocks around the presidential palace, [[La Moneda]], are where most ministries, services and commercial banks can be found. [[Vitacura]] and El Golf host most of the city's high-rise buildings and are also home to the Latin American headquarters of several United Nations organizations.<ref name="CINVER-RM"/> Though Santiago's expansion has caused newer vineyards to move to more rural locations, many of the country's oldest wineries, built in the 19th century, have preserved cellars in the valley.<ref name="CINVER-RM"/>

==Government and administration==
The region is divided into 6 [[Provinces of Chile|provinces]], which are themselves divided into 52 [[Communes of Chile|communes]]. Since 2021 the region is governed by the governor, who is elected by popular vote. The current governor is [[Claudio Orrego|Claudio Orrego Larraín]] ([[Independent politician|Independent]]).
