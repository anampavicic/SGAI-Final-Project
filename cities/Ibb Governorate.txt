'''Ibb''' ({{langx|ar|إِبّ}} ''{{transliteration|ar|ʾIbb}}'') is a [[Governorates of Yemen|governorate]] of [[Yemen]]. It is located in the inland south of the country with [[Taiz Governorate|Ta'izz Governorate]] to the southwest, [[Ad Dali' Governorate]] to the southeast, [[Dhamar Governorate]] to the north, and short borders with [[Al Bayda Governorate|Al Bayda' Governorate]] to the east and [[Al Hudaydah Governorate]] to the west. It has an area of 5,344&nbsp;km² and a [[population]] estimated at around 1,665,000 in 2004, making it the most densely populated governorate in [[Yemen]] outside of [[San'a]] city.  It is the third largest province in Yemen.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yemen Ibb Governorate |url=http://worldmisc.altafser.com/read/yemen-ibb-governorate |access-date=2024-05-22 |website=poster |language=en}}</ref>

Its capital is [[Ibb]], which, along with [[Jibla, Yemen|Jibla]], are extremely significant historic cities. The province contains many attractions in districts such as Yareem, Ba'dan and Al-Sabrah. Ibb is located on the southwestern side of the escarpment of the [[Upper Yemen|Yemen Highlands]], with dramatic drops to [[Ta'izz]] city and the Tihama coastline. There are also impressive views of 3,070 metre high [[Jabal Sabir]] to the south.

Owing to the way in which it captures the upper-level southwestern [[monsoon]]al flow during the months from April to October, Ibb governorate is the wettest place in [[Arabia]]. Though meteorological data are exceedingly poor and of questionable accuracy, the annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is probably more than 1,000&nbsp;mm (40&nbsp;inches) and some estimate suggest it could be as high as 1,500mm (60&nbsp;inches). There is little rain from November to February, but for the rest of the year there is probably at least 100mm (4&nbsp;inches) of rain per month. Temperatures are warm, averaging about 30&nbsp;°C (86&nbsp;°F) in the day but [[night]]s are quite cool.

Because of its abundant rainfall, Ibb is known as "the fertile province". Almost the whole area of the governorate outside urban centres is cultivated despite the steep terrain, and the number of crops produced is extraordinarily large for so small an area. [[Khat|Qat]] is particularly important, but [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[sesame]] and [[sorghum]] are the major sources of food for most people outside Ibb city. Sophisticated systems for management and storage of water from the seasonal rains allows extra crops to be grown during the dry season.

This sophisticated agriculture allows Ibb to support an extremely dense rural population, with densities of up to 500 people/km² common in the wettest areas.

In recent years, Ibb governorate has been the scene of numerous sit-ins in protest at government policies: many of the most significant anti-government protesters since 1999 have been natives of Ibb and surrounding areas.
