=== Syrian Civil War ===
In the course of [[Syrian Civil War]], as the [[Syrian Army]] has concentrated its forces on wresting back control of Aleppo, rebels have slowly gained ground in the eastern tribal heartland, aiming to control  the country's 200,000 barrel-a-day oil output.<ref name="reudeir">Khaled Yacoub Oweis, [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-crisis-east-idUSBRE87D0OH20120814 "Assad's Aleppo focus allows rebel gains in Syria's east"], Reuters, Aug 14, 2012</ref> In August 2012, units of the [[Free Syrian Army]] (FSA) targeted the remaining isolated outposts of the Syrian Army forces in north-east Syria, where the FSA controls all the main roads. There were said to be only 3 Army outposts left in Deir ez-Zor province countryside and they were under attack. On November 30, 2012, Syrian troops withdrew from [[Al-Omar Field|Omar oil field]], one of the last regime positions east of Deir ez-Zor city near the Iraqi border. This meant that the rebels controlled the country's major fields. This happened after Syrian troops lost the [[Conoco]] gas reserve on November 27. The insurgents took control of an oil field for the first time on November 4 when they overran Al-Ward, the most important in the province. After also losing control of Al-Jofra field also in November, the army controlled not more than five fields, all located to the west of Deir ez-Zor city.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.com/topic/syria/syrian-troops-reportedly-withdrew-omar-oil-field-one-last-regime-positions-east-deir|title=Syrian troops reportedly withdrew from Omar oil field, one of the last regime positions east of Deir Ezzor |date=November 30, 2012 |publisher=Al Jazeera |access-date=November 30, 2012}}</ref> Residents in Deir ez-Zor used crude oil for heating and agriculture for lack of fuel.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5WRNfx0Wjc  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305014242/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5WRNfx0Wjc&feature=player_embedded |archive-date=2014-03-05 |url-status=dead|title=أهالي دير الزور يستخدمون النفط الخام كوقود للتدفئة |date=9 December 2012 |publisher=Al Arabia |access-date=9 December 2012}}</ref> On 1 January 2013, it was reported that two thirds of Deir ez-Zor Governorate was under rebel control.<ref name="jazjanfirst">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISTG4dB5oxE "سوريا - أهم المناطق التي سيطر عليها الجيش الحر عام 2012"], Al Jazeera, 1 January 2013.</ref>
