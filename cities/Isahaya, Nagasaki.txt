== History ==
Isahaya was part of ancient [[Hizen Province]]. The place name of "Isahaya" appears in documents from the [[Kamakura period]]. During the [[Sengoku period]], the area was controlled by a cadet branch of the [[Ryūzōji clan]]. It was part of the holdings of [[Saga Domain]] during the [[Edo Period]]. The town of Isahaya was established on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. On April 1, 1923, Isahaya annexed the villages of Isahaya and Kita-Isahaya. On September 1, 1940, it annexed the villages of Oguri, Ono, Yuki, Matsuyama, Motono, and Nagata to form the city of Isahaya.

In July 1957, a severe downpour within Nagasaki caused a large flood in Isahaya, with over 500 casualties and 3500 injuries reported in Isahaya alone ([[1957 Isahaya floods]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jma-net.go.jp/nagasaki-c/k_yoho/saigai/ooame/1957-07-isahaya.html|script-title=ja:1957年（昭和32） 7月　諫早豪雨|website=[[Japan Meteorological Agency]]|language=Japanese|access-date=16 September 2018|archive-date=27 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200927053058/https://www.jma-net.go.jp/nagasaki-c/k_yoho/saigai/ooame/1957-07-isahaya.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On March 1, 2005, the towns of [[Tarami, Nagasaki|Tarami]], [[Moriyama, Nagasaki|Moriyama]], [[Iimori, Nagasaki|Iimori]], [[Takaki, Nagasaki|Takaki]] and [[Konagai, Nagasaki|Konagai]] (all from [[Kitatakaki District, Nagasaki|Kitatakaki District]]) were merged to create the new and expanded city of Isahaya. The city was once part of Kitatakaki District, but due to this merger, the district has no more municipalities left and the district was officially dissolved.

==Government==
Isahaya has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 26 members. Isahaya contributes four members to the Nagasaki Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the [[Nagasaki 2nd district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

== Economy ==
Due to its geographic location, Isahaya has long been a transportation nexus for Nagasaki prefecture. Numerous [[industrial park]]s have attracted advanced technology companies such as electronics and aerospace-related components. In addition, the eastern part has been reclaimed since ancient times, and it is the largest grain-producing area in the prefecture. Surrounded on three sides, the ocean, [[commercial fishing]] is also important to the local economy.

==Education==
Isahaya has 28 public elementary schools and 14 public junior high schools operated by the city government, and one junior high school operated by the Nagasaki Prefectural Board of Education. The prefecture also operates the five public high schools and one special education school for the handicapped. There are also one private junior high school and three private high schools.  The private  [[Nagasaki Wesleyan University]] is located in Isahaya.
