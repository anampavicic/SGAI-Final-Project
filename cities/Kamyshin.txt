Near Kamyshin, the Volga is quite close—{{convert|17|km|sp=us}}—to the upper reaches of the [[Ilovlya River]], the tributary of the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]]. The distance between the sources of the [[Kamyshinka River]], the tributary of the Volga, and the Ilovlya is only a little more than {{convert|4|km|sp=us}}. In this place in ancient times there existed a [[portage]] ("volok") many times used by the troops invading the land of the [[Khazars]], and moving from the Don basin to the Volga. In the 16th century, the Turkish [[Sultan]] [[Selim II]] attempted to build a canal here.<ref>[[Pyotr Semyonov-Tyan-Shansky]], "Volga v fiziko-geograficheskom otnosheniir Bol'shaia Sov.

Kerner, 'The Urge To the Sea', University of California Press, 1942] at [[Internet Archive]]</ref> A similar effort was later made by [[Peter the Great]] who built the fort, originally named Petrovsk, to protect workmen during the (unfinished) construction of the canal.
