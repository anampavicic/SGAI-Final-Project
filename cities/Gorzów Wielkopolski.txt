'''Gorzów Wielkopolski''' ({{IPAc-pl|AUD|Pl-Gorzów_Wielkopolski-2.ogg|'|g|o|ż|u|f|-|w|J|e|l|k|o|'|p|o|l|s|k|J|i}}; {{langx|de|Landsberg an der Warthe}}; {{langx|la|Landsbergum, Landsbergum iuxta Wartam}}<ref>Nicolaus Leutinger, Zacharias Gartz, ''Scriptores de rebus Marchiae Brandenburgensis maxime celebrium'', vol. 1</ref>), often abbreviated to '''Gorzów Wlkp.''' or simply '''Gorzów''', is a city in western [[Poland]], on the [[Warta]] river. It is the second largest city in the [[Lubusz Voivodeship]] with 115,247 inhabitants ({{as of|alt=December 2023|2023|12}})<ref name="population" /> and one of its two capitals with a seat of a [[voivode]], with the other being [[Zielona Góra]].

Around Gorzów, there are two large forest areas: Gorzów Woods to the north, where the [[Barlinek-Gorzów Landscape Park]] is situated, and Noteć Woods to the southeast. The biggest oil fields in Poland are located near Gorzów.

==Etymology==
The pre-1945 German name ''Landsberg an der Warthe'', dating back to 1257, derived from the German words [[States of Germany|''land'']] or 'state' and ''berg'' or 'mountain' combined with ''Warthe''{{spaced ndash}}the German name for the river [[Warta]].

The Polish name Gorzów, written as Gorzew, is known from Polish maps and historical books dating back to the 19th century or perhaps earlier.<ref name="HMW">Henryk M. Wozniak, Gazeta Zachodnia, [http://www.wozniak.senat.pl/index.php?strona=1259&tresc=1747 "Gorzów tak - Wielkopolski nie."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104220358/http://www.wozniak.senat.pl/index.php?strona=1259&tresc=1747 |date=2013-11-04 }}</ref> The name appeared in a compendium called ''Ancient Poland according to its history, geography and statistics'' published in 1848 by Samuel Orgelbrand in [[Warsaw]]. Ten years earlier, in 1838, the same name Gorzew was used in a book published in [[Paris]] with a corresponding yet broader title encompassing all of Poland.<ref>[http://pbl.ibl.poznan.pl/dostep/index.php?s=d_biezacy&f=zapisy_szczeg&p_zapis=122122 Polska Bibliografia Literacka] Polska w kształcie dykcjonarza historyczno-statystyczno-jeograficznego opisana przez Jędrzeja Słowaczyńskiego</ref>

The current spelling of "Gorzów" appears on the map featuring "Królestwo Polskie" published in [[Lwów]] in 1900 with "Landsberg an der Warthe" in parentheses next to "Gorzów". The name is interpreted in several different ways according to rules of the Old Polish language, originating from "gorzenie" (fire, burning) or gora- gorze (mountain - of from the mountain) or "pogorzelcy" (survivors of a fire), or alternatively "gorzelnia" (distillery) or "gorzałka" (spirits).

The place originated as a craftsmen settlement during the medieval period of the Polish royal dynasty of Piast.

In Polish, it was the name 'Gorzów' which eventually stuck, beating the alternative postwar name "Kobylagóra", or 'Mare Mountain', which survives today as the name of a street in the city. The word ''Wielkopolski'' means "[[Great Poland|Greater Polish]]", after the [[Greater Poland Voivodeship|voivodeship of that name]] of which Gorzów was a part from 1946 to 1950, was added later. The area of today's Gorzów was part of the historical region of [[Greater Poland]] until the mid-13th century.

During the reign of the first Polish monarchs of the [[Piast dynasty]] there was a craft and trade settlement<ref name=pwn>{{cite web|url=https://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo/Gorzow-Wielkopolski;3906896.html|title=Gorzów Wielkopolski|website=Encyklopedia PWN|access-date=5 February 2020|language=pl}}</ref> and until the mid-13th century, the land where the river Kłodawka meets the Warta was the location of a defensive fort established by the [[Poland|Polish]] [[Piast dynasty]].<ref name="PWN">Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN Warsaw 1976</ref> In 1249 the [[Duchy of Silesia|Silesian]] Duke [[Bolesław II Rogatka]] had sold [[Lubusz Land]] in the west to the [[House of Ascania|Ascanian]] Margraves of [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], and the city of ''Landisberch Nova'' (named after [[Altlandsberg]]) was founded on the site in 1257. The city was at that time an eastern outpost of the newly established [[Neumark]] region of Brandenburg, close to the [[Duchy of Greater Poland|Greater Polish]] fortress of [[Santok]]. After a war broke out over control of the region in 1319, the town came under control of the [[Duchy of Pomerania]], but by 1325 it fell to Brandenburg again.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Rymar|first=Edward|year=1979|title=Rywalizacja o ziemię lubuską i kasztelanię międzyrzecką w latach 1319–1326, ze szczególnym uwzględnieniem stosunków pomorsko-śląskich|magazine=Śląski Kwartalnik Historyczny Sobótka|language=pl|issue=4|pages=492, 494|issn=0037-7511}}</ref> In 1325 Polish, in 1432 [[Hussite]] troops beleaguered the city. In 1373 the city became part of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] (or ''Czech Lands''), ruled by the [[Luxembourg dynasty]]. In 1402, the Luxembourgs reached an agreement with [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]] in [[Kraków]]. Poland was to buy and re-incorporate Gorzów and the surrounding region,<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogalski|first=Leon|year=1846|title=Dzieje Krzyżaków oraz ich stosunki z Polską, Litwą i Prussami, poprzedzone rysem dziejów wojen krzyżowych. Tom II|language=pl|location=Warszawa|pages=59–60}}</ref> but eventually the Luxembourgs sold the city to the [[Teutonic Order]]. In 1454, after the [[Thirteen Years’ War (1454–1466)|Thirteen Years’ War]] broke out, the Teutonic Knights sold the city to Brandenburg in order to raise funds for war against Poland. In the 16th century the city became [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], with [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Gorzów Wielkopolski|St. Mary's Cathedral]] changing its allegiance in 1537.

In 1701 Landsberg (Gorzów) became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. On 4 February 1813 during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] the Russian [[Ataman]] [[Aleksandr Chernichev]] and his [[Cossack]] troops defeated a [[First French Empire|French]] battalion of 1,500 men of [[Louis-Nicolas Davout]]'s corps. In 1815 – in the course of an administrative restructuring – the town became part of Prussia's [[Province of Brandenburg]]. One of the main escape routes for surviving insurgents of the Polish [[November Uprising]] from partitioned Poland to the [[Great Emigration]] led through the city.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Umiński|first=Janusz|year=1998|title=Losy internowanych na Pomorzu żołnierzy powstania listopadowego|magazine=Jantarowe Szlaki|volume=4 |language=pl|issue=250|page=16}}</ref> The city, like all of Prussia, was included in the [[German Empire]] in 1871 during the [[unification of Germany]].

During [[World War II]], the Germans established nine [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]] camps, as well as four labour units of the [[Stalag III-C]] [[German prisoner-of-war camps in World War II|prisoner-of-war camp]] for [[French prisoners of war in World War II|French]], [[Italian Military Internees|Italian]] and Soviet prisoners of war in the city.<ref name="pwn" />

In early 1945 during [[World War II]] the town was heavily damaged following the retreat of the [[Wehrmacht]] ahead of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]]. The Red Army arrived in the city on 30 January 1945, approaching from the left bank of the river Warta. The Wehrmacht had already evacuated most of the city, and the advancing forces met very little resistance. Over the course of the next few days, most of the city centre was destroyed, reportedly through the accidental spread of a fire started in order to light the westward march of the Red Army.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The city became part of Poland in accordance with border changes promulgated at the postwar [[Potsdam Conference]], supposedly pending a final peace conference with Germany. Since a peace conference never took place, the town was effectively ceded to Poland. German residents who had not fled or died in the war were [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–1950)|expelled]] in accordance to the [[Potsdam Agreement]], and the city was gradually repopulated with Polish settlers from central Poland and those expelled from [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|Polish territory annexed by the Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Politics Today Companion to West European Politics|author=Geoffrey K.

It was at this time that Gorzów's now sizeable [[Tatar]] and [[Romani people|Romani]] communities arrived in the town. Not having had an agreed Polish name, the town was initially [[Commission for the Determination of Place Names|renamed]] as "Kobylagóra" on 30 May 1945, later as "Gorzów nad Wartą" on 7 July 1945 and finally "Gorzów Wielkopolski" on 5 November 1946.

Between 1975 and 1998, it was the capital of the [[Gorzów Voivodeship]].
