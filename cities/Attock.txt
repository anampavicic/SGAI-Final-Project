==History==
===Ancient period===
Attock is located in the historical region of [[Gandhara]]. [[Alexander the Great]], [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], [[Timur]], [[Nader Shah]] and [[Babur]] crossed the Indus at or about this spot ([[Attock Fort]]) in their respective invasions of [[Indian subcontinent|India]].<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Attock|volume=2|page=886}}</ref>

After the founding of the city by the Mughal emperor Akbar,<ref name=":1" /> the [[Attock Fort]] was completed in 1583 under the supervision of [[Khawaja Shamsuddin Khawafi]], a minister of Akbar.<ref name="Hasan2005">{{cite book|last=Hasan|first=Shaikh Khurshid|title=Historical forts in Pakistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HH_fAAAAMAAJ|access-date=17 July 2011|year=2005|publisher=National Institute of Historical & Cultural Research Centre of Excellence, Quaid-i-Azam University|isbn=978-969-415-069-7|page=37}}</ref> During the Mughal era, Attock was part of the [[Subah of Lahore|Lahore Subah]] of Punjab.<ref name="auto1">{{cite book |last1=Singh |first1=Surinder |title=The Mughal Subah of Lahore, 1581-1751: A Study of Administrative Structure and Practices |date=1985 |publisher=Panjab University}}</ref>
[[File:Lahore Subah.png|left|thumb|Attock in the [[Subah of Lahore|Lahore Subah]], depicted in map of Mughal India by [[Robert Wilkinson (cartographer)|Robert Wilkinson]] (1805)]]
Nader Shah crossed through Attock when he defeated the Mughals at the [[Battle of Karnal]] and thus ended Mughal power in Northern India. The Battle of Attock took place at Attock Khurd on 28 April 1758, between the Durrani state and [[Maratha Empire]]. The Marathas under [[Raghunathrao|Raghunathrao Ballal Peshwa]] and [[Tukoji Rao Holkar|Tukojirao Holkar Bahadur]] were victorious in the battle and Attock was captured.<ref>{{cite news|title=Attock to Cuttack, PM Narendra Modi causes a stir|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/attock-to-cuttack-pm-narendra-modi-causes-a-stir/articleshow/59332065.cms|work=[[The Economic Times]]|date=June 27, 2017}}</ref>

But this conquest was short-lived as [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] came in person to recapture Attock and checked the Maratha advance after destroying their forces at [[Third Battle of Panipat|Panipat]]. After the decline of the Durrani state, the [[Sikh Empire|Sikhs]] invaded and occupied [[Attock District]]. The [[Sikh Kingdom]] (1799–1849) under [[Ranjit Singh]] (1780–1839) captured the fortress of Attock in 1813 from the Durrani Nawab{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}. After the occupation of [[Kashmir]] by [[Sikh Empire|Sikh Kingdom]] in 1820 many [[Kashmiris]] migrated to the plains of Attock.

In February 1849, [[Attock Khurd]] (Old Attock) was conquered by the [[British East India Company]] who created Campbellpur District. Following the [[Indian Rebellion]] in 1857, the region's strategic value was appreciated by the [[British Empire|British]], who established the [[Attock Cantonment|Campbellpur Cantonment]] in 1857–58.<ref name=":2" />

===Modern Period===
The Campbellpur Cantonment was established by the British colonial rulers in 1858. Campbellpur District was organised in 1904,<ref name=":2" /> by the division of [[Talagang Tehsil]] in the [[Jhelum District]] with the [[Pindigheb]], [[Fateh Jang]] and Attock tehsils from [[Rawalpindi District]]. Today the Attock district consists of six tehsils: [[Fateh Jang Tehsil|Fateh Jang]], [[Hazro Tehsil|Hazro]], [[Hasan Abdal]], [[Jand Tehsil|Jand]], and [[Pindi Gheb Tehsil|Pindi Gheb]].

The city's foundations were laid in 1908 and the city was named after [[Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde|Sir Colin Campbell]], [[Commander-in-Chief, India|British Commander-in-Chief of India]].<ref name=":2" /> The old city was established near the 16th century near the [[Attock fort]] that had guarded the major routes between [[Central Asia]] and [[South Asia]]. Attock's first oil well was drilled in [[Khaur]] in 1915,<ref name="World oil">{{cite book|title=World oil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CXVAAQAAIAAJ|access-date=17 July 2011|date=March 1947|publisher=Gulf Publishing Company.|page=12}}</ref> while the Attock Oil Company was established<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3MNFAQAAIAAJ&q=%22campbellpur+attock|title=Punjab District Gazetteers: Attock district, 1930|last=(India)|first=Punjab|date=1932|publisher=Superintendent, Government Printing|language=en}}</ref> with a selling arrangement with the [[Burmah Oil Company]]. During 1928, the region produced 350,000 barrels of oil.<ref>{{cite news |title=India is natural kerosene market |publisher=The Japan Times and Mail |date=26 December 1929}}</ref>

Attock was one of the northernmost points of the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab Province]] of [[British Raj|British India]] prior to the [[partition of India|partition]]; it thus found itself being a part of the common [[Hindustani language|Hindi-Urdu]] phrase used to describe the length of [[colonial India]]: "Attock se Cuttack" (from Attock to [[Cuttack]]).
The term "Attock se Cuttack" was first used to describe the extent of the [[Maratha Empire]] after they conquered Cuttack in 1750 and Attock in 1758.<ref name="Rajghatta2017">{{cite web |last1=Rajghatta |first1=Chidanand |title=Attock to Cuttack, PM Narendra Modi causes a stir |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/attock-to-cuttack-pm-narendra-modi-causes-a-stir/articleshow/59332065.cms |publisher=[[The Economic Times]] |access-date=23 June 2020 |language=en |date=27 June 2017}}</ref>

After the [[Partition of India|independence]] of [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]] in 1947, [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]] minorities emigrated to India, while [[Muslim]] refugees from India settled in Attock. The [[Government of Pakistan]] renamed Campbellpur as Attock in 1978.<ref name=":0"/> The city and surrounding area are known for their high representation among soldiers of the [[Pakistan Army]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_XdeCwAAQBAJ&q=campbellpur+&pg=PT152|title=The Pakistan Paradox: Instability and Resilience|last=Jaffrelot|first=Christophe|date=2015-08-15|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190613303|language=en}}</ref>
