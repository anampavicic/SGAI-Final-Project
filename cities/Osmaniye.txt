'''Osmaniye''' ({{IPA|tr|osˈmaːnije|pron}}) is a city on the eastern edge of the [[Çukurova]] plain in southern [[Turkey]]. It is the seat of [[Osmaniye Province]] and [[Osmaniye District]].<ref name=il>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx İl Belediyesi], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory. Retrieved 1 March 2023.</ref> Its population is 252,186 (2022).<ref name=tuik>{{Cite web |title=Address-based population registration system (ADNKS) results dated 31 December 2022, Favorite Reports|url=https://biruni.tuik.gov.tr/medas/?kn=95&locale=en |access-date=13 March 2023|publisher=[[TÜİK]]|language=en|format=XLS}}</ref>

Backed by the foothills of the [[Nur Mountains]], Osmaniye lay on one of the old [[Silk Road]]s and was always a place of strategic importance since it straddled the main route between [[Anatolia]] and the Middle East.

Osmaniye lies at the centre of a rich agricultural region watered by the [[Ceyhan]] river and known for growing peanuts. During the intensely hot summers many residents escape either to the Mediterranean coast or into the Nur mountains. The [[Yayla (resort)|yayla]] of [[Zorkun]] is a particularly popular mountain retreat.

Osmaniye is strongly associated with [[Devlet Bahçeli]], the leader of the [[Nationalist Movement Party|MHP]], who was its member of parliament for many years.

== History ==
Although Osmaniye was probably ruled in turn by the [[Hittites]], [[Persian Empire|Persians]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenians]], there is nothing left to show their presence in the modern city.

An [[Islam]]ic presence was first established by the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]], auxiliaries in his army being the first [[Turkish people|Turks]] to fight in [[Anatolia]]. They obviously liked the area and following the [[Battle of Manzikert|Turkish victory]] over the [[Byzantine]]s at [[Malazgirt]] in 1071 waves of [[Turkish people|Turkish]] conquest began. The Nur Mountains were settled by the Ulaşlı tribe of the [[Oghuz Turks|Turkmen]]s.

The Ulaşlı remained the dominant local power into the period of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and were even involved in the [[Celali]] uprisings, during a period of crisis for the Ottomans in the 17th century. Eventually, in 1865 the Ottoman general Derviş Paşa was charged with bringing law and order to the Çukurova. He established his headquarters in the Osmaniye villages of Dereobası, Fakıuşağı and Akyar and brought the Ulaşlı down from the mountains to the village of Hacıosmanlı. This eventually became the province of Osmaniye. It was named as Cebeli Bereket during the Ottoman period and was renamed after the formation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kathryn Libal|editor=Benjamin C. Fortna |title=Childhood in the Late Ottoman Empire and After|chapter-url=https://doi.org/10.1163/9789004305809|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden; Boston |isbn=978-90-04-30580-9|page=52|volume=59|chapter=Child Poverty and Emerging Children’s Rights Discourse in Early Republican Turkey|year=2015}}</ref>

Between 1924 and 1933 the city of Osmaniye was the capital of the province of the same name. However, in 1933 the province was abolished and Osmaniye became the district governorate for Adana province. Then in 1996 Osmaniye was reinstated as Turkey's 80th province with the city of Osmaniye as its capital. Since then it has received more investment for infrastructure and now feels more like a city than the market town of old.

== Local attractions ==
Osmaniye town has few attractions for visitors other than the city-centre Kent Müzesi (City Museum).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Yale |first=Pat |title=Osmaniye |url=http://www.turkeyfromtheinside.com/places-to-go/q/120-osmaniye.html}}</ref> However, it makes a good base for visiting the scant remains of the nearby Roman city of [[Castabala (city)|Hierapolis-Castabala]]  which huddles at the base of a craggy rock with a castle, probably built by the Armenians, perched on top of it.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Yale |first=Pat |title=HİERAPOLİS-CASTABALA |url=http://www.turkeyfromtheinside.com/places-to-go/q/42-places-to-go/594-herapols-castabala.html}}</ref>
