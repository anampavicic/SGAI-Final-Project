Meghalaya, alongside the neighbouring Indian states, has been of archaeological interest. People have lived in Meghalaya since the [[Neolithic period]]. Neolithic sites discovered so far are located in areas of high elevation in [[Khasi Hills]], [[Garo Hills]] and in neighbouring states, where Neolithic style ''jhum'' or shifting cultivation is practised even today. The highland plateaus fed by abundant rains provided safety from floods and a rich soil.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hazarika |first=Manjil |year=2006 |title=Neolithic Culture of Northeast India: A Recent Perspective on the Origins of Pottery and Agriculture |journal=Ancient Asia |volume=1 |pages=25–44 |doi=10.5334/aa.06104 |doi-access=free }}</ref> The importance of Meghalaya is its possible role in human history via domestication of rice.

The Khasi, Garo, and Jaintia tribes had their own kingdoms until they came under British administration in the 19th century. Later, the British incorporated Meghalaya into Assam in 1835.<ref name="akrl" /> The region enjoyed semi-independent status by virtue of a treaty relationship with the British Crown. When Bengal was [[1905 Partition of Bengal|partitioned on 16 October 1905]] by [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], Meghalaya became a part of the new province of [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]]. When the partition was reversed in 1912, Meghalaya became a part of the province of Assam. On 3 January 1921 in pursuance of Section 52A of the [[Government of India Act 1919|Government of India Act of 1919]], the governor-general-in-council declared the areas now in Meghalaya, other than the Khasi states, as "backward tracts." Subsequently, the British administration enacted the [[Government of India Act 1935]], which regrouped the backward tracts into two categories: "excluded" and "partially excluded" areas.{{citation needed|date= September 2022}}

Meghalaya has many rivers. Most of these are rainfed and seasonal. The important rivers in the Garo Hills region are Ganol, Daring, Sanda, Bandra, Bugai, Dareng, [[Simsang River|Simsang]], Nitai and the Bhupai. In the central and eastern sections of the plateau, the important rivers are Khri, Umtrew, Digaru, Umiam or Barapani, Kynshi (Jadukata), Umngi, Mawpa, Umiam Khwan, Umngot, Umkhen, Myntdu and Myntang. In the southern Khasi Hills region, these rivers have created deep gorges and several waterfalls.{{citation needed|date= September 2022}}

About 70% of the state is forested, of which {{convert|9496|km2|abbr=on}} is dense primary subtropical forest.<ref name="Meghalaya and Its Forests"/> The Meghalayan forests are considered to be among the richest botanical habitats of Asia. These forests receive abundant rainfall and support a vast variety of floral and faunal biodiversity. A small portion of the forest area in Meghalaya is under what are known as "[[sacred grove]]s" (see [[Sacred groves of India]]). These are small pockets of an ancient forest that have been preserved by the communities for hundreds of years due to religious and cultural beliefs. These forests are reserved for religious rituals and generally remain protected from any exploitation. These sacred groves harbour many rare plant and animal species. The [[Nokrek Biosphere Reserve]] in the West Garo Hills and the [[Balphakram National Park]] in the South Garo Hills are considered to be the most biodiversity-rich sites in Meghalaya.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} In addition, Meghalaya has three wildlife sanctuaries. These are the Nongkhyllem Wildlife Sanctuary, the Siju Sanctuary, and the Baghmara Sanctuary, which is also the home of the insect-eating [[pitcher plant]] ''[[Nepenthes khasiana]]'' also called "Me'mang Koksi" in the Garo language.{{citation needed|date= September 2022}}

Due to diverse climatic and topographic conditions, Meghalaya forests support a vast floral diversity, including a large variety of [[parasite]]s, [[epiphyte]]s, [[succulent plant]]s and [[shrub]]s. Two of the most important tree varieties are ''[[Shorea robusta]]'' (sal tree) and ''[[Tectona grandis]]'' (teak). Meghalaya is also the home to a large variety of fruits, vegetables, spices, and medicinal plants. Meghalaya is also famous for its large variety of orchids&nbsp;— nearly 325 of them. Of these, the largest variety is found in the Mawsmai, Mawmluh and Sohrarim forests in the Khasi hills.

Conversion from indigenous to Christianity began in the 19th century during the [[British Raj|British colonial]] era. In the 1830s, [[American Baptist International Ministries|American Baptist Foreign Missionary Society]] had become active in Northeast India to convert indigenous tribes to Christianity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=R.

Taking up the offer, the Welsh Presbyterian Mission began work at the Cherrapunji mission field. By the early 1900s, other Protestant denominations of Christianity were active in Meghalaya. The outbreak of World Wars forced the preachers to return home to Europe and America. It is during this period that [[Catholicism]] took root in Meghalaya and neighbouring regions. In the 20th century, Union Christian College started operations at Umiam, Shillong. Currently, Presbyterians and Catholics are two most common Christian denominations found in Meghalaya.<ref>Amrit Kumar Goldsmith, ''The Christians In The North East India: A Historical Perspective'', Regional Organizer of Churches' Auxiliary of Social Action, Regional Headquarters at Mission Compound, Satribari, Guwahati</ref>

The '''Jaintia Hills''' district was created on 22 February 1972. It has a total geographical area of {{convert|3819|km2}} and a population of 295,692 as per the 2001 census. The district headquarters is in [[Jowai]]. [[Jaintia Hills]] district is the largest producer of coal in the state. Coal mines can be seen all over the district. [[Limestone]] production in the state is increasing, as there is high demand from cement industries.
Recently, the one big district was divided into two: West Jaintia Hills and East Jaintia Hills

The '''East Khasi Hills''' district was carved out of the Khasi Hills on 28 October 1976. The district has covered an area of {{convert|2748|km2}} and has a population of 660,923 as per the 2001 census. The headquarters of East Khasi Hills is located in Shillong.

The '''Ri-Bhoi''' district was formed by the further division of East Khasi Hills district on 4 June 1992. It has an area of {{convert|2448|km2}}. The total population of the district was 192,795 in the 2001 census. The district headquarters is at [[Nongpoh]]. It has a hilly terrain, and a large part of the area is covered with forests. The Ri-Bhoi district is known for its pineapples and is the largest producer of pineapples in the state.

The '''West Khasi Hills''' district is the largest district in the state with a geographical area of {{convert|5247|km2}}. The district was carved out of Khasi Hills District on 28 October 1976. The district headquarters are located at [[Nongstoin]].

The '''East Garo Hills''' district was formed in 1976 and has a population of 247,555 as per the 2001 census. It covers an area of {{convert|2603|km2}}. The District Headquarters are at [[Williamnagar]], earlier known as Simsangiri. [[Nongalbibra]], a town in this district, has many coal mines. The coal is transported to [[Goalpara]] and [[Jogighopa]] via [[National Highway 62 (India, old numbering)|NH62]].

The '''West Garo Hills''' district lies in the western part of the state and covers a geographical area of {{convert|3714|km2}}. The population of the district is 515,813 as per the 2001 census. The district headquarters are located at [[Tura, Meghalaya|Tura]].

The '''South Garo Hills''' district came into existence on 18 June 1992 after the division of the West Garo Hills district. The total geographical area of the district is {{convert|1850|km2}}. As per the 2001 census the district has a population of 99,100. The district headquarters are at [[Baghmara, India|Baghmara]].

{{Main|Education in Meghalaya}}
[[File:IIM, Shillong.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Indian Institute of Management, Shillong]] Campus]]
Meghalaya schools are run by the state government or by private organisations, including religious institutions. Instruction is only in English. Other [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] like Assamese, Bengali, Garo, Hindi, Khasi, Mizo, Nepali and Urdu are taught as optional subjects. The secondary schools are affiliated with the council for the [[Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations|Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE)]], the [[Central Board for Secondary Education]] (CBSE), the [[National Institute of Open Schooling|National Institute of Open School (NIOS)]] or the [[Meghalaya Board of School Education]].

Under the 10+2+3 plan, after completing secondary school, students typically enroll for two years in a junior college, also known as pre-university, or in schools with a higher secondary facility affiliated with the [[Meghalaya Board of School Education]] or any central board. Students choose from one of three streams: liberal arts, commerce or science. Upon completing the required coursework, students may enroll in general or professional degree programs.

== Government and politics ==
{{Main|Government of Meghalaya|Meghalaya Legislative Assembly}}
Meghalaya's Governor is [[C. H. Vijayashankar]] since July 2024.<ref name="Governor_2024">{{cite news |title=C.H. Vijayashankar appointed Meghalaya Governor |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ch-vijayashankar-appointed-meghalaya-governor/article68456452.ece |work=The Hindu |date=28 July 2024 |access-date=28 July 2024}}</ref>

=== State government ===
The [[Meghalaya Legislative Assembly]] has 60 members at present. Meghalaya has two representatives in the [[Lok Sabha]], one each from Shillong and Tura. It also has one representative in the [[Rajya Sabha]].

Since the creation of the state the [[Gauhati High Court]] has jurisdiction in Meghalaya. A Circuit Bench of the Guwahati High Court has been functioning at Shillong since 1974. In March 2013, the [[Meghalaya High Court]] was separated from the Gauhati High Court and now the state has its own High Court.

=== Local self-government ===
[[File:NE Autonomous divisions of India.svg|thumb|Autonomous District Councils in Northeast India]]
To provide local self-governance machinery to the rural population of the country, provisions were made in the [[Constitution of India]]; accordingly, the [[Panchayati Raj]] institutions were set up. Because of distinct customs and traditions prevalent in the northeast region, it was felt necessary to have a separate political and administrative structure in the region.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Some of the tribal communities in the region had their own traditional political systems, and it was felt that Panchayati Raj institutions may come into conflict with these traditional systems. The Sixth Schedule was appended to the Constitution on the recommendations of a subcommittee formed under the leadership of [[Gopinath Bordoloi]], and the constitution of [[Autonomous regions of India|Autonomous District Councils]] is provided in certain rural areas of the northeast including areas in Meghalaya.
The ADCs in Meghalaya are the following:
* [[Garo Hills Autonomous District Council]]
* [[Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council]]
* [[Jaintia Hills Autonomous District Council]]

== Economy ==
Meghalaya is predominantly an [[agrarian economy]]. Agriculture and allied activities engage nearly two-thirds of the total workforce in Meghalaya. This sector's contribution to the state's NSDP is about one-third. Agriculture in the state is characterised by low productivity and unsustainable farm practices. Despite the large percentage of the population engaged in agriculture, the state imports food from other Indian states.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Infrastructural constraints have also prevented the economy of the state from creating high-income jobs at a pace commensurate with that of the rest of India.

Meghalaya's gross state domestic product for 2012 was estimated at {{INRConvert|16173|c}} in current prices.<ref name=pcindia>[http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/finres/fr_2013_14/fr_meghalaya1314.pdf Meghalaya] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716065506/http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/finres/fr_2013_14/fr_meghalaya1314.pdf |date=16 July 2014 }} Planning Commission, Govt of India (May 2014)</ref> As of 2012, according to the [[Reserve Bank of India]], about 12% of total state population is below the poverty line, with 12.5% of the rural Meghalaya population is below the poverty line; while in urban areas, 9.3% are below the poverty line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=15283 |title=See 3rd table set for 2012 in Table 162, Number and Percentage of Population Below Poverty Line |publisher=Reserve Bank of India, Government of India |year=2013 |access-date=20 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407102043/http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=15283 |archive-date=7 April 2014 }}</ref>

=== Agriculture ===
[[File:Tea Plantation Agriculture in Meghalaya India on the way to Shillong.jpg|thumb|Tea Plantation in Meghalaya, on the way to Shillong]]
Meghalaya is basically an agricultural state with about 80% of its population depending entirely on agriculture for their livelihood. Nearly 10% of the geographical area of Meghalaya is under cultivation. Agriculture in the state is characterised by limited use of modern techniques, low yields, and low productivity. As a result, despite the vast majority of the population being engaged in agriculture, the contribution of agricultural production to the state's GDP is low, and most of the population engaged in agriculture remain poor. A portion of the cultivated area is under the traditional [[shifting cultivation|shifting agriculture]] known locally as ''Jhum cultivation''.

Meghalaya produced 230,000 tonnes of food grains in 2001. Rice is the dominant food grain crop accounting for over 80% of the food grain production in the state. Other important food grain crops are maize, wheat, and a few other cereals and pulses. Besides these, potato, [[ginger]], [[turmeric]], [[black pepper]], [[areca nut]], [[Bay leaf]] ([[Cinnamomum tamala]]), betel, short-staple cotton, [[jute]], [[mesta]], [[mustard plant|mustard]] and [[rapeseed]] etc. are some of the important cash crops. Besides the major food crops of rice and maize, the state is renowned for its horticultural crops like orange, lemon, pineapple, guava, litchi, banana, jack fruits and fruits such as plum, pear, and peach.<ref name="Horticulture Crops">[http://megagriculture.gov.in/PUBLIC/crops/horticulture_crops.aspx Horticulture Crops] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141119223536/http://megagriculture.gov.in/PUBLIC/crops/horticulture_crops.aspx |date=19 November 2014 }} Department of Agriculture, Govt of Meghalaya (2009)</ref>

[[File:Agriculture in Kukon Meghalaya India.jpg|thumb|Agriculture in Kukon, Meghalaya]]
Grains and staples production covers about 60% of the land area dedicated to crops. With the introduction of different crops of high yielding varieties in the mid-1970s, a remarkable increase in food grain production has been made. A major breakthrough was achieved when high yielding varieties of paddy<ref>[http://megagriculture.gov.in/PUBLIC/crops/rice.aspx Rice] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221115007/http://megagriculture.gov.in/public/crops/rice.aspx |date=21 December 2016 }} Department of Agriculture, Govt of Meghalaya (2009)</ref> such as Masuri, Pankaj IR 8, RCPL and other improved varieties series – especially IR 36 which is suitable for Rabi season – allowing three crops to be grown every year. Another milestone was reached when Megha I and Megha II, which are cold tolerant rice varieties developed by the [[Indian Council of Agricultural Research|ICAR]] North East Region at Umroi near Shillong, was released in 1991–92 for the higher altitude regions where there was no high yielding rice varieties earlier. Today the state can claim that about 42% area under paddy has been covered with high yielding varieties with the average productivity of {{convert|2300|kg/ha|abbr=on}}. As is the case with maize and wheat where the productivity has increased tremendously with the introduction of HYV from {{convert|534|kg/ha|abbr=on}} during 1971–72 to {{convert|1218|kg/ha|abbr=on}} of maize and from {{convert|611|kg/ha|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1490|kg/ha|abbr=on}} of wheat.<ref>[http://megagriculture.gov.in/PUBLIC/crops/food_grains.aspx Food grains] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301011048/http://megagriculture.gov.in/PUBLIC/crops/food_grains.aspx |date=1 March 2014 }} Department of Agriculture, Govt of Meghalaya (2009)</ref>

Oilseeds such as rapeseed, mustard, linseed, soybean, castor, and sesame are grown on nearly {{convert|100|km2|abbr=on}}. Rape and mustard are the most important oilseeds<ref>[http://megagriculture.gov.in/PUBLIC/crops/oil_seeds.aspx Oil Seeds] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010052401/http://megagriculture.gov.in/PUBLIC/crops/oil_seeds.aspx |date=10 October 2013 }} Department of Agriculture, Govt of Meghalaya (2009)</ref> accounting for well over two-thirds of the oilseed production of nearly 6.5 thousand tonnes. Fiber crops such as cotton, jute, and ''mesta'' are among the only cash crops in Meghalaya, grown in Garo Hills.<ref>[http://megagriculture.gov.in/PUBLIC/crops/fibre_crops.aspx Fibre Crops] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009002901/http://megagriculture.gov.in/PUBLIC/crops/fibre_crops.aspx |date=9 October 2013 }} Department of Agriculture, Govt of Meghalaya (2009)</ref> These have been losing popularity in recent years as indicated by their declining yield and area under cultivation.

Climatic conditions in Meghalaya permit a large variety of horticulture crops including fruits, vegetables, flowers, spices, mushrooms, and medicinal plants.<ref name="Horticulture Crops"/> These are considered to be higher value crops, but home food security concerns have prevented farmers at large from embracing them. The important fruits grown include citrus fruits, pineapples, papayas, and bananas. In addition to this, a large variety of vegetables are grown in the state, including cauliflower, cabbages, and radishes.

Areca nut plantations can be seen all over the state, especially around the road from [[Guwahati]] to [[Shillong]]. Other plantation crops like tea, coffee and [[cashews]] have been introduced lately and are becoming common. A large variety of spices, flowers, [[medicinal plants]] and [[mushrooms]] are grown in the state.

===Industry===
[[File:Cement Plant MCL.jpg|thumb|View of MCL Cement plant, Thangskai, P.O. Lumshnong, Jaintia Hills]]
Meghalaya has a rich base of [[natural resource]]s. These include minerals such as coal, [[limestone]], [[sillimanite]], [[Kaolin]] and [[granite]] among others. Meghalaya has a large forest cover, rich biodiversity, and numerous water bodies. The low level of industrialisation and the relatively poor infrastructure base acts as an impediment to the exploitation of these natural resources in the interest of the state's economy. In recent years two large cement manufacturing plants with production capacity more than 900 MTD have come up in Jaintia Hills district and several more are in pipeline to use the rich deposit of very high-quality limestone available in this district.

===Electricity infrastructure===
[[File:Mawphlang Dam Reservoir Meghalaya India.jpg|thumb|Meghalaya has abundant but undeveloped hydroelectric resources. Above is Mawphlang hydroelectric dam reservoir.]]
Meghalaya, with its high mountains, deep gorges, and abundant rains has a large, unused hydroelectric potential. The assessed generation capacity exceeds 3000 MW. The current installed capacity in the state is 185 MW, but the state itself consumes 610 MW. In other words, it imports electricity.<ref>[http://meecl.nic.in/demand.htm Demand for power in Meghalaya] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713120902/http://meecl.nic.in/demand.htm |date=13 July 2014 }} Meghalaya Energy Corporation Limited</ref> The economic growth of the state suggests rising demand for electricity. The state has the potential to export net hydroelectric-generated electricity and earn income for its internal development plans. The state also has large deposits of coal, thus being a candidate for thermal power plants.

Several projects are under works. The proposed Garo Hills thermal project at Nangalbibra is expected to generate an additional 751 MW of power. There is a proposal for setting up a 250 MW thermal power plant in West Khasi Hills. The State Government aims to increase its power generation output by about 2000-2500 MW, of which 700-980 MW will be thermal based while 1400-1520 MW will be hydroelectricity. The State Government has outlined a cost-shared public-private partnership model to accelerate private sector investments in its power sector.<ref>[http://megplanning.gov.in/MSDR/infastructural_development.pdf State Planning] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001713/http://megplanning.gov.in/MSDR/infastructural_development.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }} Govt of Meghalaya, pp 129-130</ref> The generation transmission, transformation and distribution of electricity is entrusted to the Meghalaya Energy Corporation Limited which was constituted under the Electricity Supply Act, 1948.

The main tribes in Meghalaya are the [[Khasi people|Khasi]]s, the [[Garo (tribe)|Garos]], and the [[Synteng|Jaintias]]. Each tribe has its own culture, traditions, dress, and language.

===Social institutions===
[[File:GARO TRADITIONAL DRESS-9.jpg|thumb|[[Garo people|Garo]] Couple in traditional dress.]]
{{see also|Matrilineal society of Meghalaya}}
The majority of the population and the major tribal groups in Meghalaya follow a [[matrilineal]] system where lineage and inheritance are traced through women. The youngest daughter inherits all the property and she is the caretaker of aged parents and any unmarried siblings.<ref name=akrl/> In some cases, such as when there is no daughter in the family or other reasons, the parents may nominate another girl such as a daughter in law as the heir of the house and all other property they may own.

The Khasi and Jaintia tribesmen follow the traditional matrilineal norm, wherein the ''Khun Khatduh'' (or the youngest daughter) inherits all the property and responsibilities for the family. The male line, particularly the mother's brother, may indirectly control the ancestral property since he may be involved in important decisions relating to property including its sale and disposal. In case a family has no daughters, the Khasi and Jaintia (also called Syntengs) have the custom of ''ia rap iing'', where the family adopts a girl from another family, perform religious ceremonies with the community, and she then becomes ''ka trai iing'' (head of the house).<ref>Philip Richard Thornhagh Gurdon (1914), {{Google books|Jys1AQAAIAAJ|The Khasis}}, McMillan & Co., 2nd Edition, pp 85-87</ref>

In the Garo lineage system, the youngest daughter inherits the family property by default, unless another daughter is so named by the parents. She then becomes designated as ''nokna'' meaning 'for the house or home'. If there are no daughters, a chosen daughter-in-law (''bohari'') or an adopted child (''deragata'') comes to stay in the house and inherit the property. This adopted girl child is then the head of the house.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

Meghalaya has one of the world's largest surviving matrilineal cultures.

=== Civil society ===
Meghalaya's [[civil society]] considers the people of the state as a collective community that exists through [[civil society organisation]]s (CSOs), and serves the general interests of the public.<ref name=":1">Gupta, Susmita Sen (2018), Ethnicity and Development – A Civil Society Perspective from North-East India. In: Journal of Social and Political Sciences, Vol.1, No.2, 297-305. DOI: 10.31014/aior.1991.01.02.20</ref> These organisations include a wide spectrum of [[Non-governmental organization|non-government organisations (NGOs)]], other community associations, and foundations. The current status of Meghalaya's civil society and the effectiveness of the many programs is debated by scholars.

There are currently over 181 NGOs within Meghalaya that vary from charities to volunteer services and social empowerment groups.<ref>"List of NGOs in Meghalaya" ''www.giveindia.org''. Retrieved 20 November 2019.</ref><ref name=":2">"NGO Darpan". ''ngodarpan.gov.in''. Retrieved 20 November 2019.</ref> Most civil society organisations are also ethnically affiliated as the interests of different groups are championed between each organisation . This in turn causes them to become representatives of ethnic communities around the state since the same individuals from such communities also participate in corresponding organisations that protect their ethnic interests. Three student organisations that represent the major ethnic groups of Meghalaya: [[Seng Khasi Movement|Khasi Students' Union]] (KSU), Jantia Students' Union (JSU), and Garo Students' Union (GSU) embody this example into their overall functions as CSOs by applying pressure to local government in order to ensure that certain rights are being met.<ref name=":1" />

There also exists many forms of community associations that revolve around the idea of community building. This includes examples such as sports, religious, educational, and other clubs that aim to establish individuals into different social circles based on their interests.<ref name=":2" />

Philanthropic foundations in Meghalaya's civil society strive for the overall well-being of its citizens. The [[Public Health Foundation of India|Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI)]] has recently partnered with the government of Meghalaya to improve public health in many rural parts of the state by first strengthening the abilities of non-government organisations to perform such services.<ref>"Enhancing Rural Public Health Capacity in Northeast India". ''Clinton Foundation''. Retrieved 20 November 2019.</ref>

Scholars are divided on the effectiveness Meghalaya's civil society. Some argue for its important role in state development through CSOs, while others point out that their impact is not only limited from above by the central government and its military, but also from below by insurgent groups .<ref name=":3">McDuie-Ra, Duncan (19 January 2007). "Civil society organisations and human security: transcending constricted space in Meghalaya". ''Contemporary South Asia''. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.1080/09584930600938040.</ref>

Concerns over national security, such as the unification of neighbouring hostile countries and local insurgent groups for a possible attack on the Indian state, has served as the longstanding point of emphasis on how the Indian Central Government operates in the Northeast. Different administrative programs have been created to establish peace and stability in this region through economic development.<ref>Sachdeva, Gulshan. "India's Northeast: rejuvenating a conflict-riven economy", Faultines. Vol 6, 2000. http://www.satp.org/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103143002/http://www.satp.org/ |date=3 January 2014 }} satporgtp/publication/faultlines/volume6/Fault6-GSach-F.htm</ref> The [[Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act|Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA)]] that was passed in 1958 by the Indian Government granted the Indian Army exclusive powers to maintain order in this area. Many insurgent organisations were also developed alongside cultural and political movements, making it very difficult to distinguish them from what constitutes a civil society.<ref name=":3" /> These two factors have combined to enable CSOs to be easily deemed as insurgencies and grouped with other insurgent organisations that were banned by the government, thus restricting Meghalaya's civil society as a whole.<ref name=":3" /><ref>Baruah, Apurba K.

=== Traditional political institutions ===
All the three major ethnic tribal groups, namely, the Khasis, Jaintias and the Garos also have their own traditional political institutions that have existed for hundreds of years. These political institutions were fairly well developed and functioned at various tiers, such as the village level, clan level, and state level.<ref name=prtg66/>

In the traditional political system of the Khasis, each clan has its own council known as the ''Dorbar Kur'' which is presided over by the clan headman. The council or the Dorbar managed the internal affairs of the clan. Similarly, every village has a local assembly known as the ''Dorbar Shnong'', i.e. village Durbar or council, which is presided over by the village headman. The inter-village issues were dealt with through a political unit comprising adjacent Khasi Villages. The local political units are known as the raids, under by the supreme political authority is known as the ''Syiemship''. The Syiemship is the congregation of several raids and is headed an elected chief known as the ''Syiem'' or ''Siem'' (the king).<ref name=prtg66>Philip Richard Thornhagh Gurdon (1914), {{Google books|Jys1AQAAIAAJ|The Khasis}}, McMillan & Co., 2nd Edition, pp 66-75</ref> The Siem rules the Khasi state through an elected State Assembly, known as the Durbar Hima. The Siem also has his ''mantris'' (ministers) whose counsel he would use in exercising executive responsibilities. Taxes were called ''pynsuk'', and tolls were called ''khrong'', the latter being the primary source of state income. In the early 20th century, Raja Dakhor Singh was the Siem of Khymir.<ref name=prtg66/>

The Jaintias also have a three-tier political system somewhat similar to the Khasis, including the Raids and the Syiem.<ref>Philip Richard Thornhagh Gurdon (1914), {{Google books|Jys1AQAAIAAJ|The Khasis}}, McMillan & Co., 2nd Edition</ref> The raids are headed by ''Dolois'', who are responsible for performing the executive and ceremonial functions at the Raid level. At the lowest level are the village headmen. Each administrative tier has its own elected councils or durbars.

In the traditional political system of the Garos, a group of Garo villages form the A·king. The A·king functions under the supervision of the ''Nokmas'', which is perhaps the only political and administrative authority in the political institution of the Garos. The Nokma performs both judicial and legislative functions. The Nokmas also congregates to address inter-A·king issues. There are no well-organised councils or durbars among the Garos.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

=== Spirituality ===
In southern Meghalaya, located in [[Mawsynram]], is the Mawjymbuin cave. Here a massive stalagmite has been shaped by nature into a [[Shivalinga]]. According to legend, from the 13th century, this Shivalinga (called ''Hatakeswarat'') has existed in the [[Jaintia Hills]] under the reign of Ranee Singa.{{sfn|Roy|1981|p=139}} Tens of thousands of the Jaintia tribe members participate over the Hindu festival of [[Shivratri]] (''Night of Lord Shiva'') every year.{{sfn|Roy|1981|p=132}}<ref>Sudhansu R.

== Transport ==
The [[Partition of India|partition of the country]] in 1947 created severe infrastructural constraints for the [[Northeast India|Northeastern region]], with merely 2% of the perimeter of the region adjoining the rest of the country. A narrow strip of land often called the [[Siliguri Corridor]] or the Chicken's Neck, connects the region with the state of [[West Bengal]]. Meghalaya is a landlocked state with many small settlements in remote areas. The road is the only means of transport. While the capital [[Shillong]] is relatively well connected, road connectivity in most other parts is relatively poor. A significant portion of the roads in the state is still unpaved. Most of the arrivals into the Meghalaya take place through [[Guwahati]] in neighbouring Assam, which is nearly 103&nbsp;km away. Assam has a major railhead as well as an airport with regular train and air services to the rest of the country.

When Meghalaya was carved out of Assam as an autonomous state in 1972, it inherited a total road length of 2786.68&nbsp;km including 174&nbsp;km of National Highways with road density of 12.42&nbsp;km per 100 square kilometre. By 2004, total road length has reached up to 9,350&nbsp;km out of which 5,857&nbsp;km were surfaced. The road density had increased to 41.69&nbsp;km per 100 square kilometre by March 2011. Meghalaya is far below the national average of 75&nbsp;km per 100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. To provide better services to the people of the state, the Meghalaya Public Works Department is taking steps for improvement and up-gradation of the existing roads and bridges in phased manner.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

=== Road network ===
Meghalaya has a road network of around 7,633&nbsp;km, out of which 3,691&nbsp;km is black-topped and the remaining 3942&nbsp;km is gravelled. Meghalaya is also connected to Silchar in Assam, Aizawl in Mizoram, and Agartala in Tripura through national highways. Many private buses and taxi operators carry passengers from Guwahati to Shillong. The journey takes from 3 to 4 hours. Day and night bus services are available from Shillong to all major towns of Meghalaya and also other capitals and important towns of Assam and the northeastern states.

Until 1955, foreign tourists required special permits to enter the areas that now constitute the state of Meghalaya, which are sometimes compared to Scotland for their highlands, fog and scenery.<ref name=akrl/> Meghalaya has some of the thickest primary forests in the country and therefore constitutes one of the most important ecotourism circuits in India. The Meghalaya subtropical forests support a vast variety of flora and fauna. The state has two national parks and three wildlife sanctuaries.

Meghalaya also offers many adventure tourism opportunities in the form of mountaineering, rock climbing, trekking, and hiking, [[caving]] (spelunking) and water sports. The state offers several trekking routes, some of which also afford an opportunity to encounter rare animals. The [[Umiam Lake]] has a water sports complex with facilities such as rowboats, paddleboats, sailing boats, cruise-boats, water-scooters, and speedboats.

[[Cherrapunji]] is a tourist destination in north-east of India. It lies to the south of the capital Shillong. A rather scenic 50-kilometre long road connects Cherrapunji with Shillong.

[[Living root bridges]] are also a tourist draw, with many examples located near Cherrapunji.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cherrapunjee.com/living-root-bridges/|title=Living Root Bridges|work=Cherrapunjee|access-date=11 September 2017|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609231150/http://cherrapunjee.com/living-root-bridges/|archive-date=9 June 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Double-Decker root bridge, along with several others, is found in the village of [[Nongriat]], which is tourist friendly.

The most visited waterfalls in the state include the [[Elephant Falls]], Shadthum Falls, Weinia falls, Bishop Falls, [[Nohkalikai Falls]], Langshiang Falls and Sweet Falls.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} The hot springs at Jakrem near [[Mawsynram]] are believed to have curative and medicinal properties.

Nongkhnum Island located in the West Khasi Hills district is the biggest river island in Meghalaya and the second biggest in Asia. It is 14 kilometres from Nongstoin. The island is formed by the bifurcation of Kynshi River into the Phanliang River and the Namliang River. Adjacent to the sandy beach the Phanliang River forms a lake. The river then moves along and before reaching a deep gorge, forms a waterfall about 60 meters high called Shadthum Fall.

;Sacred groves
Meghalaya is also known for its "sacred groves". They are small or large areas of forests or natural vegetation that are usually dedicated to local folk deities or tree spirits or some religious symbolism over many generations, often since ancient times. These spaces are found all over India, are protected by local communities, and in some cases, the locals would neither touch leaves or fruits or in other ways damage the forest, flora or fauna taking refuge in them. This guardianship creates a sacred area where nature and wildlife thrive. The Mawphlang sacred forest, also known as "Law Lyngdoh," is one of the most famous sacred forests in Meghalaya. It's located about 25 kilometres from Shillong. It's a scenic nature destination, and one can find the sacred [[Rudraksha]] tree here.<ref>[http://ecoheritage.cpreec.org/viewsacdetail.php?$mFJyBfK$MOIb-B5vugEjzLdzxFAXZ List of Sacred Groves in Meghalaya] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602134727/http://ecoheritage.cpreec.org/viewsacdetail.php?$mFJyBfK$MOIb-B5vugEjzLdzxFAXZ |date=2 June 2015 }} Government of Meghalaya (2011)</ref>

;Lakes
Meghalaya also has many natural and manmade lakes. The Umiam Lake (popularly known as Bara Pani meaning Big water) on the Guwahati-Shillong road is a major tourism attraction for tourist. Meghalaya has several parks; Thangkharang Park, the Eco-park, the Botanical Garden and Lady Hydari Park to name a few. [[Dawki]], which is located at about 96 Kilometres from Shillong is the gateway to Bangladesh and affords a scenic view of some of the tallest mountain ranges in Meghalaya and the Bangladesh borderlands.

[[Thadlaskein Lake]] also ''Pung Sajar Nangli'' is the only historical Lake of Meghalaya. It is located besides National Highway 6 by the side of a small village called Mukhla village which falls under [[West Jaintia Hills district]] [[Jowai]]. It is about 35 mile from the city of Shillong

Balpakram National Park with its pristine habitat and scenery is a major attraction.<ref>Choudhury, A.U. (2008) Balpakram –Meghalaya's heritage IBA.

;Caves
Meghalaya has an estimated 500 natural limestone and sandstone caves spread over the entire state including most of the longest and deepest caves in the sub-continent. [[Krem Liat Prah]] is the longest cave, and Synrang Pamiang is the deepest cave. Both are located in the Jaintia Hills. Cavers from the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, Ireland, and the United States have been visiting Meghalaya for over a decade exploring these caves. Few have been developed or promoted adequately as major tourist destinations.

;Living root bridges
Meghalaya is famous for its living root bridges, a kind of [[Simple suspension bridge|suspension bridge]] made over rivers using intertwined roots of ''Ficus elastica'' trees planted on opposite banks of the river or hill slopes. These bridges can be seen around Cherrapunji, [[Nongtalang]], Kudeng Rim and Kudeng Thymmai villages (War Jaintia). A double-decker bridge exists in Nongriat village.

==Major issues==
The significant issues in the state include illegal migrants from Bangladesh, incidences of violence, political instability and deforestation from traditional cut-and-burn shift farming practices. There are several clashes between Khasi people and Bangladeshi in Meghalaya.

===Illegal immigration===
Illegal immigration has become a major issue in Indian states that surround Bangladesh – West Bengal to the west, Meghalaya and Assam to the north, and Tripura, Mizoram, and Manipur to the east.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tripathi |first1=Sanjeev |title=Illegal Immigration From Bangladesh to India: Toward a Comprehensive Solution |url=https://carnegieindia.org/2016/06/29/illegal-immigration-from-bangladesh-to-india-toward-comprehensive-solution-pub-63931 |access-date=20 June 2023 |journal=Carnegie India |date=29 June 2016 |archive-date=18 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230518042253/https://carnegieindia.org/2016/06/29/illegal-immigration-from-bangladesh-to-india-toward-comprehensive-solution-pub-63931 |url-status=live }}</ref> Dozens of political and civic groups have demanded that this migration be stopped or controlled to manageable levels.<ref>Palash Ghosh, [http://www.ibtimes.com/indias-2014-elections-narendra-modi-says-some-illegal-immigrants-bangladesh-are-better-others India's 2014 Elections: Narendra Modi Says Some Illegal Immigrants From Bangladesh Are Better Than Others] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715001456/http://www.ibtimes.com/indias-2014-elections-narendra-modi-says-some-illegal-immigrants-bangladesh-are-better-others |date=15 July 2014 }} International Business Times, NY Times, (2014)</ref> The border between Meghalaya and Bangladesh is about 440 kilometres long, of which some 350 is fenced; but the border is not continuously patrolled and is porous.

===Violence===
Between 2006 and 2013, between 0 and 28 civilians have died per year in Meghalaya (or about 0 to 1 per 100,000 people), which the state authorities have classified as terror-related intentional violence.<ref>[http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/database/index.html Meghalaya Violence Statistics, India Fatalities 1994-2014] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529084134/http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/database/index.html |date=29 May 2011 }} SATP (2014)</ref> The world's average annual death rate from intentional violence, in recent years, has been 7.9 per 100,000 people.<ref name=gede>[http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/GBAV2/GBAV2011-Ch2-Summary.pdf Global Burden of Armed Violence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924021451/http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/GBAV2/GBAV2011-Ch2-Summary.pdf |date=24 September 2015 }} Chapter 2, Geneva Declaration, Switzerland (2011)</ref> The terror-related deaths are from conflicts primarily between different tribal groups and against migrants from Bangladesh.

There have been repeated clashes with [[Assam]] e.g. Mukroh.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/5-meghalaya-villagers-killed-in-border-firing-by-assam-cops/articleshow/95697806.cms | title=Assam Meghalaya Border News: Six killed as Assam cops and armed Meghalaya mob clash along border &#124; Guwahati News - Times of India | website=[[The Times of India]] | date=23 November 2022 | access-date=27 November 2022 | archive-date=27 November 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221127114317/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/5-meghalaya-villagers-killed-in-border-firing-by-assam-cops/articleshow/95697806.cms | url-status=live }}</ref>

===Political instability===
The state has had 23 state governments since its inception in 1972, with a median life span of less than 18 months. Only three governments have survived more than three years. Political instability has affected the state's economy in the past.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://megplanning.gov.in/report/vision2030/chapter2.pdf |title=Participatory Planning and Inclusive Governance |website=Megplannnig.gov.in\accessdate=2017-02-27 |access-date=8 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911004507/http://megplanning.gov.in/report/vision2030/chapter2.pdf |archive-date=11 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Over recent years, there has been increasing political stability.

===Jhum farming===
[[File:Jhum cultivation in Nokrek Biosphere Reserve Meghalaya India Northeast India 2004.jpg|thumb|Jhum cultivation, or cut-and-burn shift farming, in Nokrek Biosphere Reserve of Meghalaya.]]
Jhum farming, or cut-and-burn shift cultivation, is an ancient practice in Meghalaya.<ref name=skr/> It is culturally engrained through folklores. One legend states the god of wind with the god of hail and storm shook off seeds from the celestial tree, which were picked up and sown by a bird known as ''do' amik''. These were the seeds of rice. The god gave the human beings some of those celestial seeds, provided instruction on shift agriculture and proper rice cultivation practice, with the demand that at every harvest a portion of the first harvest must be dedicated to him. Another folktale is from the Garo Hills of Meghalaya where a man named ''Bone-Neripa-Jane-Nitepa'' harvested rice and millet from a patch of land he cleared and cultivated near the rock named ''misi-Kokdok''. He then shared this knowledge with others, and named the different months of the year, each of which is a stage of shifting cultivation.<ref>Mazumdar, Culture Change in Two Garo Villages, Calcutta: Anthropological Survey of India (1978)</ref>

In modern times, shift cultivation is a significant threat to the biodiversity of Meghalaya.<ref>Ramakrishnan, P. S. (1992), Shifting agriculture and sustainable development: an interdisciplinary study from north-eastern India, Parthenon Publishing Group, {{ISBN|1-85070-383-3}}</ref> A 2001 satellite imaging study showed that shift cultivation practice continues and patches of primary dense forests are lost even from areas protected as biosphere.<ref>Roy, P. S., & Tomar, S. (2001), Landscape cover dynamics pattern in Meghalaya, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 22(18), pp 3813-3825</ref> ''Jhum'' farming is a threat not only for natural biodiversity, it is also a low yield unproductive method of agriculture. It is a significant issue in Meghalaya, given majority of its people rely on agriculture to make a living.<ref>Saha, R., Mishra, V. K., & Khan, S. K. (2011), Soil erodibility characteristics under modified land-use systems as against shifting cultivation in hilly ecosystems of Meghalaya India, Journal of Sustainable Forestry, 30(4), 301-312</ref><ref>Pakrasi, K., Arya, V. S., & Sudhakar, S. (2014), Biodiversity hot-spot modeling and temporal analysis of Meghalaya using Remote sensing technique, International Journal of Environmental Sciences, Vol 4, Number 5, pp 772-785</ref> Shift farming is a practice that is not unique to northeastern Indian states such as Meghalaya, but the issue is found throughout southeast Asia.<ref>Spencer, J. E. (1966), Shifting cultivation in southeastern Asia (Vol. 19), University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520035171}}</ref>
