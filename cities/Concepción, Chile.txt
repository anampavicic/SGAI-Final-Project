It sits about 500&nbsp;km south of the nation's capital, [[Santiago]].

The city was first settled in the [[Bay of Concepción]], in the zone that would later become the commune of [[Penco]], now part of the [[Greater Concepción|Concepción conurbation]]. The city's demonym, {{lang|es|[[wikt:penquista|penquista]]}}, comes from the place of its original foundation. The city center and historic district is located in the [[Valle de la Mocha]] (La Mocha Valley), where it relocated after serious damage left by [[1751 Concepción earthquake|an earthquake]] in 1751.

The origin of Concepción dates back to 1550, when it was founded by Pedro de Valdivia as part of the [[Spanish Empire]], under the name of ''Concepción de María Purísima del Nuevo Extremo'', and was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Chile]] between 1565 and 1573, retaining the unofficial position of military capital<ref name=encicloreg2006>{{cite book|title=Enciclopedia regional del Bío Bío|page=44|language=es|date=2006|isbn=956-16-0404-3|publisher=[[Pehuén Editores]]}}</ref> for the rest of the [[Colonial Chile|colonial period]]. The city was an important site in the [[independence of Chile|struggle for Chile's independence]], with the Chilean declaration of Independence being held at Concepción's ''Plaza de la Independencia''. Until the election of [[Manuel Montt]] in 1851 as president, executive power in independent Chile was dominated by Concepción elites.<ref>{{Cite book <!-- Citation for entire book is at {{Cite isbn|978956111163}} -->

[[File:Atlas pittoresque pl 036.jpg|right|thumb|220x220px|House of a [[Mapuche]] ''[[cacique]]'' in Concepción in 1846]]
Concepción was founded by Don [[Pedro de Valdivia]]<ref>Ida Stevenson Weldon Vernon (1969) ''Pedro de Valdivia, Conquistador of Chile'', Greenwood Press</ref> in 1550 north of the [[Bío Bío River]], at the site which is today known as [[Penco]]. At that time it was given the name ''Concepción de María Purísima del Nuevo Extremo'' (Mary Immaculate Conception of the New End). The new settlement of Concepción was just a few kilometers north of ''[[La Frontera (geographical region)|La Frontera]]'' (The Frontier), the boundary between Spanish territory and the land of the [[Mapuche]], an American Indian ethnic group that remained independent until the 1870s. The settlement was formally recognized by the Spanish authorities as a town two years later by a royal decree. It was given a coat-of-arms that is still in use today.

At the time of the Spanish arrival to the Concepción area chronicler [[Jerónimo de Vivar]] noted local Mapuches wore gold and silver [[bracelet]]s and "sort of crowns". This is interpreted either as [[Incas in Central Chile|Incan]] gifts, war spoils from defeated Incas, or the adoption of Incan [[metallurgy]].<ref name="Silva1983">{{Cite journal |last=Silva Galdames |first=Osvaldo |date=1983 |title=¿Detuvo la batalla del Maule la expansión inca hacia el sur de Chile? |url=https://revistas.uchile.cl/index.php/CDH/article/download/46464/48492 |url-status=dead |journal=Cuadernos de Historia |language=es |volume=3 |pages=7–25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190201013520/https://revistas.uchile.cl/index.php/CDH/article/download/46464/48492 |archive-date=February 1, 2019 |access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref>

Although Concepción was a significant military settlement for the [[Captaincy General of Chile]], it was overrun and destroyed by [[Arauco War|Mapuche armies]] in 1554, and once again after being refounded in 1555. Concepción was restored during the governorship of [[García Hurtado de Mendoza, 5th Marquis of Cañete|García Hurtado de Mendoza]] when he landed there and built a fort on the Alto de Pinto in 1557. The town was refounded once more on January 6, 1558, by captain Jerónimo de Villegas. It became the headquarters of the military forces engaged against the [[Mapuche]] in [[Araucanía (historic region)|La Araucanía]] over the next two centuries, growing to a population of 10,000 despite a [[siege]] in 1564 and other attacks by the Mapuche. Concepción was the home of the [[Audiencia Real|Real Audiencia]] from 1565 to 1575.

[[Earthquakes]] and [[tsunamis]], which razed the town in [[1570 Concepción earthquake|1570]], 1657, 1687, 1730 and 1751, led the authorities to move the town to its current site in the [[Valle de la Mocha]], alongside the [[Bío Bío River]]; the old site lay empty until March 29, 1842, when the present town of [[Penco]] was founded.

The new site for the town of Concepción became the main town of the Intendancy of Concepción, whose jurisdiction extended from the [[Maule River]] to La Frontera. The first Intendant of Concepción was the Irishman [[Ambrose O'Higgins, Marquis of Osorno]], who later became [[Royal Governor of Chile]] and [[List of Viceroys of Peru|Viceroy of Peru]].

When the First National Government Board met in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] on September 18, 1810, citizens of Concepción joined up. Concepción was used as the point of entry by the Spanish Army in the attempt by the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] to re-conquer Chile. Concepción politicians and soldiers became a significant political force in the newly independent country.

On January 1, 1818, Ambrose O'Higgins's son, [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], proclaimed and took the oath of the [[Chilean War of Independence]] in the main square of Concepción, which since then has been known as "Plaza de la Independencia". Until the moment of independence, the city had been the scene of [[Battle of Concepción, Chile (disambiguation)|various engagements]] in its old and new settlements.

On February 20, 1835, the town again was largely destroyed by [[1835 Concepción earthquake|an earthquake]] and had to be rebuilt.

By 1875, a key British community and German colony existed within the province.  By 1895, there was an even larger Spanish presence.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Edmundson |first=William |url=https://archive.org/details/historybritishpr00edmu |title=A History of the British Presence in Chile: From Bloody Mary to Charles Darwin and the Decline of British Influence |date=2009 |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |isbn=9780230114838 |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historybritishpr00edmu/page/n138 126] |url-access=limited}}</ref>

The [[Universidad de Concepción]], founded in 1919, became the first secular private university in Chile. The neighboring harbor of Talcahuano is the site of the largest naval base in Chile.

On February 27, 2010, an [[2010 Chile earthquake|8.8 magnitude earthquake]] struck the city of Concepción, killing more than 521 people and injuring thousands nationwide. Following the earthquake, geologists relying on global positioning satellite (GPS) data concluded that the city had been displaced roughly {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} to the west as a result of the event.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/03/09/chile.earth.shifts/index.html?hpt=T2 |title=Chile quake moves city more than 10 feet |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312141611/http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/03/09/chile.earth.shifts/index.html?hpt=T2 |archive-date=March 12, 2010 |date=March 9, 2010 |access-date=March 10, 2010}}</ref> The tsunami that followed missed the city.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1969570,00.html |title=Quake Response Doesn't Live Up to Chile's Self-Image |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306092346/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1969570,00.html |archive-date=March 6, 2010 |first=Eben |last=Harrell |date=March 4, 2010 |access-date=March 4, 2010}}</ref>

After the [[2010 Chile earthquake]], a [[prison riot]] began in Concepción's [[El Manzano (prison)|El Manzano]] prison following a failed escape attempt by the inmates. Different parts of the prison were set on fire and the riot was controlled only after the guards shot into the air and received help from military units.<ref>[[El Mercurio]], March 1.

==Seismology==
Like most of the Chilean territory, the Concepción region is [[Seismology|seismically active]], with much of Concepción destroyed by a violent [[1939 Chillán earthquake|earthquake in 1939]]. An [[1953 Concepción earthquake|earthquake in 1953]] damaged 15% of the town's buildings. Another major [[1960 Concepción earthquake|earthquake in 1960]] had a nearby epicenter.<ref>John Milton Nickles, Marie Siegrist (1965) ''Bibliography and Index of Geology Exclusive of North America'', Geological Society of America, v.28</ref>

On February 27, 2010, [[2010 Chile earthquake|an earthquake]] of 8.8 magnitudes struck at 35.846°S, 72.719°W, {{convert|115|km|mi|abbr=on}} NNE of the city.

===Universities===
The University Pencopolitana whose name was '''Pontificia Universidad Pencopolitana de La Concepción''' (Pontifical Pencopolitana University of The Conception) was an old university founded through a decree of the Bishop of Concepción, delivered to the administration of the [[Society of Jesus]] which functioned between the years 1724 and 1767. On May 24, 1751, an [[1751 Concepción earthquake|earthquake]] followed by a [[tsunami]], ravaged the city causing serious damage, including the destruction of the library of the university and all of its funds. As a product of the fury of the waters, a rich collection of texts of the governance of southern Chile were lost, which resulted in a disaster for the culture and collective memory of the city. Due to the natural disasters, it was decided to relocate the city to the called [[Valle de la Mocha]], location where it is currently situated. Slowly the seminary was revived in the new location, in a period of decline in academic activity in Chilean monastic universities after the creation of the [[Universidad de San Felipe]], yet some degrees continued to be granted before the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus]] in 1767.
The aforementioned University is considered to be the natural and legitimate predecessor of the [[Universidad Católica de la Santísima Concepción]] (UCSC), erected by the Archbishop of Concepción in 1991, from the [[Talcahuano]] Regional Headquarters of the [[Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile]].

The image of the Pontifical University of Concepción Pencopolitana, is still valid, for His Majesty [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos I of Spain]] in his 1990 speech on the occasion of his inauguration as Doctor Honoris Causa in the [[University of Chile]], in [[Santiago de Chile]], said: "The work of the Pontifical University Pencopolitana should not be ignored, even before the creation of the University of San Felipe" (Juan Carlos's account fails to acknowledge the existence of San Felipe's predecessor, the Dominican Universidad de Santo Tomás de Aquino, from the sixteenth century in Santiago).

Meanwhile, the University of Chile allowed schools in the city to teach courses in law which allowed men to obtain a law degree. Among its students was Henry Urrutia Manzano, who decades later became president of the Supreme Court of Chile.

The [[Universidad de Concepción]] was created in 1919 by a group of citizens including [[Enrique Molina Garmendia]], its first rector.

Eventually, the university began to receive state support, becoming part of the [[Chilean Traditional Universities|traditional universities]], becoming one of the three most important universities in the country, and the most important at the regional level.

As might be expected for such a large urban area heavily dependent on wood-burning for heat and diesel for transport, the air in Concepción is third-most polluted in Chile, after [[Santiago]] and [[Temuco]].<ref>[http://en.mercopress.com/2007/06/29/severe-air-pollution-plagues-chilean-cities Severe air pollution plagues Chilean cities] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525232346/http://en.mercopress.com/2007/06/29/severe-air-pollution-plagues-chilean-cities |date=May 25, 2014}} Friday, June 29, 2007 – 21:00 UTC</ref>

According to data collected in 2002 in the Census of the [[National Institute of Statistics (Chile)|National Institute of Statistics]], the township has an area of {{convert|221.6|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} and a population of 216,061 inhabitants, of whom 103,860 are men and 112,201 are women.

As a commune, Concepcion is home to 14.35% of the total population of the region. 1.88% (4,058 persons) is for the rural population and 98.12% (212,003) for the urban population. Moreover, 5.5% of the country's population lives in the Greater Concepción metro area.

Between 1970 and 1982 there is a large increase in the population. One reason is the inclusion of [[San Pedro de la Paz|San Pedro]], segregated from the municipality of [[Coronel, Chile|Coronel]].

The Concepción commune population sharply declined in 1996 as its territory was divided, creating [[Chiguayante]] and [[San Pedro de la Paz]]. The number of people living in these communes has grown quickly since they have become [[bedroom communities]] of ''Concepción'', i.e. residential cities that do not have a center with many shops, as is the case of Concepcion.

There is a significant percentage of foreign residents in the city, the most numerous are the Spanish, Italian and US expatriate communities. There are also smaller segments of German, French, British, [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Greek people|Greek]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Croats|Croatian]], Scandinavian, [[Arab]] and Australian descendants in a city settled by waves of immigration.

==Cultural life==
[[File:Año nuevo en Concepción.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Fireworks in celebration for the arrival of 2007 in Concepción]]
To an outsider, there may be confusion between the [[demonym]]s of the inhabitants of Concepción and the nearby city of Penco. Due to the previous location of Concepción being where Penco currently stands, inhabitants of Concepción are called ''penquistas'' while inhabitants of Penco are known as ''pencones''. Additionally, the unofficial term ''pencopolitano'' has been coined to refer to locals of any commune belonging to the [[Greater Concepción|metropolis]] or, in a wider definition, to the [[Concepcion Province, Chile|Concepción province]], although the term penquista can technically be used in this case as well.
[[File:REC_2020.jpg|thumb|220px|left|''Rock en Conce'' festival, 2020.]]

In 2014, the ''Rock en Conce'' festival began to take shape. It would be held outdoors, in the city's ''Parque Bicentenario'' (Bicentennial Park), and access to it would be free. The aim of the festival would be to restore the musical spotlight that the city embodied and that earned it the reputation of being the ''cradle of Chilean rock'' and, at the same time, to establish itself as a major tourist attraction for the city.<ref>{{Cite web |date=December 31, 2014 |title=Festival "Rock en Conce" ya tiene fecha y lugar |url=https://www.tvn.cl/especiales/musica/noticias/festival-rock-en-conce-ya-tiene-fecha-y-lugar-1543128 |website=Televisión Nacional de Chile}}</ref> Its first edition took place on Saturday, March 7, 2015, and since then it has been held with great success every year at the end of each summer, bringing together emerging local bands with major and renowned artists from the national and international scene.<ref>{{Cite web |last=María Ignacia Inostroza |date=March 19, 2019 |title=#FotosRP: ¡Todo un éxito Rock En Conce 2019! |url=https://www.rockandpop.cl/2019/03/fotosrp-todo-un-exito-rock-en-conce-2019/ |website=Rock & Pop}}</ref>

==Sports==
Concepción was one of the host cities of the official [[1959 Basketball World Cup]], where [[Chile national basketball team|Chile]] won the bronze medal.

Today, Concepción is home to three professional [[Association football|football]] teams:
* [[Club Deportivo Universidad de Concepción]], currently in the [[Chilean Primera División|Primera División]]

==Economy==
[[File:Mercado Central de Concepción.jpg|thumb|Concepción is the second commercial nucleus of Chile. In the image, the Concepción Central Market]]

Historically characterized by a strong manufacturing industry, Concepción has also been a major center for distribution and services and the financial basis of the regional economy.

===Commerce===
Trade in the city is concentrated in the ''Plaza Independencia'' (Independence Square), the pedestrian street ''Alonso de Ercilla y Zúñiga'' (built in 1981), and along the major avenues. One such avenue is the ''Diego Barros Arana''  street which has developed into the commercial center of the city and the region was until 1907 even known as "''calle Comercio''" ("Commerce Street"). New commercial centers are being developed around the old central station and the new civic district as a part of the Chilean bicentennial (September 18, 2010). A considerable percentage of local trade is taking place in settlements around the city, in communes such as [[Hualpén]], [[Talcahuano]] and [[San Pedro de la Paz]], where there are bustling shopping centers, such as [[Mall Plaza del Trébol]], and where there is a constant commercial development.

Other commercial spots, related to food, are the [[Vega Monumental]] and [[Central market of Concepción, Chile|Mercado Central de Concepción]] (Central Market of Concepción) places offering various services and agricultural and livestock products.

==Administration==
As a [[Communes of Chile|commune]], Concepción is a third-level [[administrative division of Chile]] administered by a [[municipal council]], headed by an [[alcalde]] who is directly elected every four years. The 2016–2020 mayor was Álvaro Ortiz Vera ([[Christian Democratic Party (Chile)|Christian Democratic Party]]), who was first elected in 2012. The communal council has 10 seats, which are currently occupied (2016–2020) by three for [[Christian Democratic Party (Chile)|Christian Democratic Party]], two for [[National Renewal (Chile)|National Renewal]], two for [[Independent Democrat Union]], one for [[Communist Party of Chile|Communist Party]], one for [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]], and one for [[Social Democrat Radical Party|Radical Party]].
