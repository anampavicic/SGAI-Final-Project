'''Alexandria''' is an [[independent city (United States)|independent city]] in the [[Northern Virginia|northern region]] of the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth]] of [[Virginia]], United States. It lies on the western bank of the [[Potomac River]] approximately {{convert|7|mi|0}} south of [[Downtown (Washington, D.C.)|downtown Washington, D.C.]] Alexandria is the third-largest [[principal city]] of the [[Washington metropolitan area]], which is part of the larger [[Washingtonâ€“Baltimore combined statistical area]]. As of 2022, the city's population of 159,467 made it the [[List of cities in Virginia|sixth-most populous city in Virginia]] and the [[List of United States cities by population|173rd-most populous city in the nation]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Alexandria city, Alexandria city, Virginia |url=https://data.census.gov/cedsci/profile?g=0600000US5151090020 |website=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=January 30, 2022 |archive-date=February 6, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220206003338/https://data.census.gov/cedsci/profile?g=0600000US5151090020 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Like the rest of [[Northern Virginia]] and [[Central Maryland]], present-day Alexandria has been influenced by its proximity to the U.S. capital. It is largely populated by professionals working in the [[United States federal civil service|federal civil service]], in the [[U.S. Military|U.S. military]], or for one of the many private companies which contract to [[Government contractor|provide services]] to the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]]. The city's largest employers include the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] and the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]]. Alexandria is the highest-income independent city in Virginia. 

The historic center of Alexandria is known as [[Old Town Alexandria]], or simply "Old Town". With its concentration of boutiques, restaurants, [[antique shop]]s and theaters, it is a major draw for city residents and visitors. Like Old Town, many Alexandria neighborhoods are compact and walkable. A large portion of adjacent [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], mostly south but also west of the city, has Alexandria mailing addresses. However, this area is under the jurisdiction of Fairfax County's government and separate from the independent city.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.alexandriava.gov/finance/info/default.aspx?id=27130 |title=Tax Guide for New City Residents |website=www.alexandriava.gov |language=en-US |access-date=2019-07-30 |quote=Please note that some Alexandria postal addresses are located in Fairfax County, while some Arlington postal addresses are located in the City. |archive-date=October 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191026211355/https://www.alexandriava.gov/finance/info/default.aspx?id=27130 |url-status=live}}</ref> The city is therefore sometimes referred to as the "City of Alexandria" to avoid confusion.

=== Early history ===
According to archaeologists' estimates, a succession of [[indigenous peoples]] began to occupy the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] and [[Tidewater (region)|Tidewater]] region about 3,000 to 10,000 years ago. Various [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]]-speaking peoples inhabited the lands in the [[Potomac River]] drainage area since at least the early [[14th century]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Piscataway Indians of Southern Maryland |last=Ferguson |first=Alice and Henry |publisher=Alice Ferguson Foundation |year=1960 |pages=11}}</ref>

In the summer of 1608, English settler [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] explored the Potomac River and came into contact with the [[Patawomeck]] (loosely affiliated with the [[Powhatan]]) and [[Doeg (tribe)|Doeg]] tribes who lived on the [[Virginia]] side, as well as on [[Theodore Roosevelt Island]], and the [[Piscataway Indians|Piscataway]] (also known as the Conoy), who resided on the [[Maryland]] side.<ref>Humphrey, Robert L.; Chambers, Mary Elizabeth (1977). ''Ancient Washington: American Indian Cultures of the Potomac Valley''. George Washington University.</ref> On this visit, Smith recorded the presence of a settlement called ''Assaomeck'' near the south bank of what is now [[Hunting Creek]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.alexandriava.gov/historic/info/default.aspx?id=41290 |title=Assaomeck village depended on fish |last=Cressey |first=Pamela |date=6 June 1996 |publisher=Alexandria Gazette Packet |access-date=30 November 2019 |archive-date=August 12, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200812130313/https://www.alexandriava.gov/historic/info/default.aspx?id=41290 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Colonial era ===

On October 21, 1669, a [[land patent|patent]] granted {{convert|6,000|acre|km2}} to Robert Howsing for transporting 120 people to the [[Colony of Virginia]].<ref name="Brockett and Rock">{{cite book |last1=Brockett |first1=Franklin Longdon |last2=Rock |first2=George W. |title=A Concise History of the City of Alexandria, Va: From 1669 to 1883, with a Directory of Reliable Business Houses in the City |date=1883 |publisher=Gazette Book and Job office |pages=140}}</ref>{{rp|5}} That tract later became the City of Alexandria.<ref name="Brockett and Rock" />{{rp|5}} Virginia's comprehensive [[Tobacco Inspection Act of 1730|Tobacco Inspection Law of 1730]] mandated that all tobacco grown in the colony must be brought to locally designated public warehouses for inspection before sale. One of the sites designated for a warehouse on the upper [[Potomac River]] was at the mouth of [[Hunting Creek]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tobacco.org/History/colonialtobacco.html |title=Economic Aspects of Tobacco during the Colonial Period 1612â€“1776 |website=Tobacco.org |access-date=January 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222043059/http://www.tobacco.org/History/colonialtobacco.html |archive-date=February 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> However, the ground proved to be unsuitable, and the warehouse was built half a mile up-river, where the water was deep near the shore.

Following the 1745 settlement of the [[Colony of Virginia]]'s 10-year dispute with [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]] over the western boundary of the [[Northern Neck Proprietary]], when the Privy Council in London found in favor of Lord Fairfax's expanded claim, some of the Fairfax County gentry formed the [[Ohio Company]] of Virginia. They intended to conduct trade into the interior of America, and they required a trading center near the head of navigation on the Potomac. The best location was Hunting Creek tobacco warehouse, since the deep water could easily accommodate sailing ships. Many local tobacco planters, however, wanted a new town further up Hunting Creek, away from nonproductive fields along the river.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://alexandriava.gov/historic/info/default.aspx?id=28266 |title=Discovering the Decades: 1740s &#124; Historic Alexandria &#124; City of Alexandria, VA |website=Alexandriava.gov |date=January 5, 2011 |access-date=January 29, 2012 |archive-date=March 24, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324140337/http://alexandriava.gov/historic/info/default.aspx?id=28266 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Around 1746, Captain Philip Alexander II (1704â€“1753) moved to what is south of present Duke Street in Alexandria. His estate, which consisted of {{convert|500|acre|km2}}, was bounded by Hunting Creek, Hooff's Run, the Potomac River, and approximately the line which would become Cameron Street. At the opening of Virginia's 1748â€“49 legislative session, there was a petition submitted in the [[House of Burgesses]] on November 1, 1748, that the "inhabitants of Fairfax (Co.) praying that a town may be established at Hunting Creek Warehouse on Potowmack River," since Hugh West was the owner of the warehouse. The petition was introduced by [[Lawrence Washington (1718â€“1752)|Lawrence Washington]], the representative for Fairfax County, the son-in-law of [[William Fairfax]], and a founding member of the Ohio Company. To support the company's push for a town on the river, Lawrence's younger brother [[George Washington]], an aspiring surveyor, made a sketch of the shoreline touting the advantages of the tobacco warehouse site.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gmdhtml/gwmaps.html |title=George Washington: Surveyor and Mapmaker |website=Loc.gov |access-date=July 31, 2009 |archive-date=August 13, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813151546/http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gmdhtml/gwmaps.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

Since the river site was amidst his estate, Philip opposed the idea and strongly favored a site at the head of Hunting Creek (also known as Great Hunting Creek). It has been said that in order to avoid a predicament the petitioners offered to name the new town ''Alexandria'', in honor of Philip's family. As a result, Philip and his cousin Captain John Alexander (1711â€“1763) gave land to assist in the development of Alexandria and are thus listed as the founders. This John was the son of Robert Alexander II (1688â€“1735). On May 2, 1749, the House of Burgesses approved the river location and ordered "Mr. Washington do go up with a Message to the [[Virginia Governor's Council|Council]] and acquaint them that this House have agreed to the Amendments titled An Act for erecting a Town at Hunting Creek Warehouse, in the County of Fairfax."<ref>{{cite book |author=Virginia.

The auction was conducted on July 13â€“14, 1749.

Almost immediately upon establishment, the town founders called the new town "Belhaven", believed to be in honor of a Scottish patriot, [[John Hamilton, 2nd Lord Belhaven and Stenton]], the Northern Neck tobacco trade being then dominated by Scots. The name Belhaven was used in official lotteries to raise money for a Church and Market House, but it was never approved by the legislature and fell out of favor in the mid-1750s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/va/richmondcity/newspapers/gazette5.txt |title=The Scheme of a Lottery, at Belhaven, in Fairfax County: January 24, 1750/51; Virginia Gazette extracts; The William and Mary Quarterly, Vol.12 No.2 (October 1903) |website=Files.usgwarchives.net |access-date=August 22, 2018 |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171955/http://files.usgwarchives.net/va/richmondcity/newspapers/gazette5.txt |url-status=live}}</ref> The town of Alexandria did not become incorporated until 1779.

In 1755, [[Edward Braddock|General Edward Braddock]] organized his fatal expedition against [[Fort Duquesne]] at [[Carlyle House]] in Alexandria. In April 1755, the governors of Virginia, and the provinces of [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], and [[Province of New York|New York]] met to determine upon concerted action against the [[Early Modern France|French]] in America.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=573}}

In March 1785, commissioners from Virginia and Maryland met in Alexandria to discuss the commercial relations of the two states, finishing their business at [[Mount Vernon]]. The [[Mount Vernon Conference]] concluded on March 28 with an agreement for freedom of trade and freedom of navigation of the Potomac River. The Maryland legislature, in ratifying this agreement on November 22, proposed a conference among representatives from all the states to consider the adoption of definite commercial regulations. This led to the calling of the [[Annapolis Convention of 1786]], which in turn led to the calling of the [[Federal Convention of 1787]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=573}}

A portion of the City of Alexandriaâ€”most of the area now known as [[Old Town Alexandria|Old Town]] as well as [[Boundary Markers of the Original District of Columbia|the areas of the city northeast of what is now King Street]]â€”and all of today's [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]] share the distinction of having been the portion of Virginia ceded to the U.S. Government in 1791 to help form the new [[District of Columbia (until 1871)|District of Columbia]]. Over time, a movement grew to separate what was called "[[Alexandria County, D.C.|Alexandria County]]" from the District of Columbia. As competition grew with the port of [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] and the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] fostered development on the north side of the Potomac River, Alexandria's economy stagnated; at the same time, residents had lost any representation in Congress and the right to vote and were disappointed with the negligible economic benefit (on the Alexandria side) of being part of the national capital. Alexandria still had an important port and market in the [[Slave trade in the United States|slave trade]], and as talk increased of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolishing]] slavery in the national capital, there was concern that Alexandria's economy would suffer greatly if this step were taken. After a referendum, voters petitioned Congress and Virginia to return the portion of the District of Columbia south of the Potomac River (Alexandria County) to Virginia. On July 9, 1846, Congress [[District of Columbia retrocession|retroceded Alexandria County to Virginia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citymuseumdc.org/gettoknow/faq.asp |title=Get to know D.C. â€“ Frequently Asked Questions About Washington, D.C. |publisher=History Society of Washington, D.C. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206013429/http://www.citymuseumdc.org/gettoknow/faq.asp |archive-date=February 6, 2007}}</ref> The City of Alexandria was re-chartered in 1852 and became independent of Alexandria County in 1870. The remaining portion of Alexandria County changed its name to [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]] in 1920.

The first fatalities of the North and South in the [[American Civil War]] occurred in Alexandria. Within a month of the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]], the Civil War's first battle, [[Union Army]] troops occupied Alexandria, landing troops at the base of King Street on the [[Potomac River]] on May 24, 1861. A few blocks up King Street from their landing site, the commander of the [[11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|New York Fire Zouaves]], Colonel [[Elmer E.

Failure to do so resulted in incidents including the arrest of ministers in their church.

In 1861 and 1862, escaped [[African-American|African American]] slaves poured into Alexandria. Safely behind Union lines, the cities of Alexandria and Washington offered comparative freedom and employment. Alexandria became a major supply depot and transport and hospital center for the Union army.<ref name="Office of Historic Alexandria">{{cite web |url=http://alexandriava.gov/uploadedFiles/historic/info/archaeology/ARFreedmensHistoricalOverview.pdf |title=Office of Historic Alexandria, Alexandria Freedmen's Cemetery: Historical Overview, April 2007, p. 2. |access-date=January 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324140231/http://alexandriava.gov/uploadedFiles/historic/info/archaeology/ARFreedmensHistoricalOverview.pdf |archive-date=March 24, 2012}}</ref> Until the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] of January 1, 1863, escaped slaves legally remained the property of their owners. Therefore, they were labeled [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contrabands]] to avoid returning them to their masters. Contrabands worked for the Union army in various support roles.

After all slaves in the seceding states were liberated, even more African Americans came to Alexandria. By the fall of 1863, the population of Alexandria had exploded to 18,000{{mdash}}an increase of 10,000 people in 16 months.<ref name="Office of Historic Alexandria" />

As of ratification of [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|the Fifteenth Amendment]], Alexandria County's black population was more than 8,700, or about half the total number of residents in the county. This newly enfranchised constituency provided the support necessary to elect the first black Alexandrians to the City Council and the Virginia Legislature.<ref name="alexandriaweba.com">[http://www.alexandriaweba.com/go/alexandriaafricanamericanhistory/freedmancemetery]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref>

At the turn of the 20th century the most common production in the city was glass, fertilizer, beer, and leather. The glass often went into beer bottles. Much of the Virginia Glass Company effort went to supply the demands of the Robert Portner Brewing Company, until fire destroyed the St. Asaph Street plant on February 18, 1905. The [[Old Dominion Glass Company]] also had a glass works fall to fire, then built a new one.

As an [[Independent city (Virginia)|independent city of Virginia]] (as opposed to an incorporated town within a county), Alexandria derives its governing authority from the [[Virginia General Assembly]] using the [[Dillon Rule]]. In order to revise the power and structure of the city government, the city must request the General Assembly to amend the charter. The present charter was granted in 1950 and it has been amended in 1968, 1971, 1976, and 1982.

Alexandria adopted a [[council-manager]] form of government by way of referendum in 1921. This type of government empowers the elected City Council to pass legislation and appoint the City Manager. The City Manager is responsible for overseeing the city's administration.

The [[Mayor]], who is chosen on a separate ballot, presides over meetings of the Council and serves as the ceremonial head of government. The Mayor does not have the power to veto Council action. Council members traditionally choose the person receiving the most votes in the election to serve as Vice Mayor. In the absence or disability of the Mayor, the Vice Mayor performs the mayoral duties.

===History===
Since its foundation, Alexandria's government has had several different forms of government. Before 1921, Alexandria had an elected eight-member Board of Aldermen and a sixteen-member Common Council whose members were elected by ward. In addition, there was an elected mayor with the power to veto legislation from the two councils. Reformers within the city during the early 20th century hoped to adopt the then-popular [[council-manager]] system. As a means to implementing this new system, the reformists proposed a plan to create a single city council elected at-large. This new system was adopted in 1921 and the first at-large councilmen were elected in June 1922.<ref>{{cite news |title=A Constant Question: Why No Wards? |url=https://alextimes.com/2009/04/a-constant-question-why-no-wards/ |access-date=31 December 2020 |work=Alexandria Times |date=30 April 2009 |archive-date=November 16, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211116092001/https://alextimes.com/2009/04/a-constant-question-why-no-wards/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1930, Alexandria annexed the town of [[Potomac, Virginia|Potomac]] from [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]]. Alexandria and Potomac stood in stark contrast. The [[streetcar suburb]] commuter town of Potomac had, as part of Arlington, been heavily influenced by the anti-vice crusades of staunch [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] [[District attorney|Commonwealth's Attorney]] [[Crandal Mackey]]. In Potomac, slaughterhouses and saloons were banned. Residents of the former town of Potomac had a different identity from those in Alexandria, and after annexation former Potomac residents began to push for the reimplementation of the ward system. In a 1932 referendum, voters decided in favor of a new plan that would expand the city council to nine members; three elected at-large and six elected by ward. Support for the new plan was highest in the former town of Potomac.<ref name="failed_experiment">{{cite news |last1=Lee Pope |first1=Michael |title=Alexandria's Failed Experiment with Wards |url=http://www.alexandriagazette.com/news/2020/oct/01/alexandrias-failed-experiment-wards/ |access-date=31 December 2020 |work=Alexandria Gazette-Packet |date=1 October 2020 |archive-date=November 8, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108065459/http://www.alexandriagazette.com/news/2020/oct/01/alexandrias-failed-experiment-wards/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

City councils elected under the new ward system began to take a more direct role in city administration. The city council and city manager gave conflicting orders to city employees while spending increased to accommodate appropriations coming from both the council and manager. With over one million dollars spent on unauthorized projects, a movement to go back to at-large councilmen emerged. In 1944, a referendum to eliminate the ward system ended with a vote in favor of the ward system. Shortly afterwards, a number of high-ranking city officials resigned, and residents appealed to the Circuit Court for an order to force a referendum. Unbeknownst to the city government, Delegate [[Armistead L. Boothe|Armistead Boothe]] introduced a bill in Richmond to hold another referendum. This bill passed the General Assembly and a vote was held on March 2, 1948. The options in the referendum included retaining the extant system or replacing it with a council of seven at-large members. Voters approved the new system with 61% of votes in favor.<ref name="failed_experiment" /> More recently, a 1983 push by the Virginia [[NAACP]] to return to the ward system failed because of a lack of support from elected officials.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Marriott |first1=Michel |title=N.
