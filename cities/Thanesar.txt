'''Thanesar''' (also known as Sthanishvara) is a historic city and [[Hindu pilgrimage sites|Hindu pilgrimage centre]] in the [[Kurukshetra district]] of [[Haryana]], [[India]]. It is located approximately 160&nbsp;km northwest of [[Delhi]]. The city [[Kurukshetra]]'s area merges with Thanesar.<ref name="Lochtefeld2002">{{cite book|author=James G.

Thanesar was the capital of the [[Pushyabhuti dynasty]], whose rulers conquered most of [[Aryavarta]] following the fall of the [[Gupta Empire]]. The Pushyabhuti emperor [[Prabhakarvardhana]] was a ruler of Thanesar in the early seventh century CE. He was succeeded by his sons, [[Rajyavardhana]] and [[Harsha]].<ref name="Sadasivan2011">{{cite book|author=Balaji Sadasivan|title=The Dancing Girl: A History of Early India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=980SAvbmpUkC&pg=PT110|year=2011|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|isbn=978-981-4311-67-0|pages=110–}}</ref> Harsha, also known as Harshavardhana, consolidated a vast empire over much of North India by defeating independent kings that fragmented from the Later Guptas.

==History==
[[File:Harsha Ka Tila.jpg|thumb|''Harsha Ka Tila'' mound west of [[Sheikh Chilli's Tomb]] complex, with ruins from the reign of 7th century ruler [[Harsha]].]]

Present-day Thanesar is located on an ancient mound. The mound (1km long and 750m wide) is known as ''Harsh ka Tila'' (Mound of Harsha). It has ruins of structures built during the reign of [[Harsha]], seventh-century CE. Amongst the archaeological finds from the mound include [[Painted Grey Ware]] shards in the pre-[[Kushana]] levels and [[Pottery in the Indian subcontinent|Red Polished Ware]] from the post-[[Gupta period]].<ref name="asi">{{cite web| title = Sheikh Chilli's Tomb, Thanesar|publisher= Archaeological Survey of India| url = http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_tktd_haryana_thanesar.asp| access-date = 2014-08-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Harsh Ka Tila |publisher= Kurukshetra district website| url = http://www.kurukshetra.nic.in/tour/Archeologysite/harsh_ka_tila.htm | access-date = 2014-08-08}}</ref>

In the post-Gupta period, Sthanishvara was the capital of the [[Vardhana dynasty]], which ruled over a major part of [[North India]] during the late-sixth and early-seventh centuries. [[Prabhakaravardhana|Prabhakarvardhana]], fourth king of the Vardhana dynasty, had his capital at Thanesar. After his death in 606 CE, his eldest son [[Rajyavardhana]] ascended the throne, who was later murdered by a rival, which led to Harsha ascending to the throne at age 16. In the following years, he conquered much of North India, extended to [[Kamarupa]], and eventually made [[Kannauj]] his capital, and ruled until 647 CE. His biography ''[[Harshacharita]]'' ("Deeds of Harsha") describes his association with Thanesar.<ref name="encystan">{{cite web | title = Sthanvishvara (historical region, India) |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/566090/Sthanvishvara | access-date = 2014-08-09 }}</ref><ref name="asi" /><ref>{{cite web| title = Harsha (Indian emperor)|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica|url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/256065/Harsha | access-date = 2014-08-09 }}</ref>

Thanesar is listed in the [[Ain-i-Akbari]] as a [[pargana]] under the [[sarkar (administrative division)|sarkar]] of [[Sirhind]], producing a revenue of 7,850,803 [[dam (Indian coin)|dam]]s for the imperial treasury and supplying a force of 1500 infantries and 50 cavalries.

Majority of architectural remains including [[Caravanserai|Karavan serai]], cells, and various arched and vaulted structures date from the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal period]]. Building remains of a large palatial structure from the pre-Islamic era were also found with two distinct phases of construction which exposed brick covered drains and rooms situated around a central courtyard.<ref>{{Cite book|title=textsThanesar|last=Pande|first=B.M.|publisher=Archaeological Survey of India|year=2016|pages=19–21}}</ref>

=== Sack of Sthaneshwar by Mahmud of Gazni ===
Thanesar was sacked and many of its temples were destroyed by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1011.<ref>{{cite web | title = Kurukshetra (India)|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/325415/Kurukshetra | access-date = 2014-08-09 }}</ref>

{{cquote|'The city of Taneshar is highly venerated by Hindus. The idol of that place is called Cakrasvamin (Chakra Swami), i.e. the owner of the cakra, a weapon that we have already described.

It had reached the ears of the King that Thanesar was held in the same veneration by idolaters, as Mecca by the faithful; that they had there set up a number of idols, the principal of which they called Jugsoma, pretending that it had existed ever since the creation.}}

Mahmud, having reached Thanesar before the Hindus, had time to take measures for its defence; the city was plundered, the idols broken, and the idol Jugsoma was sent to [[Ghazni]] to be trodden underfoot. According to Haji Mahommed Kandahary, a ruby was found in one of the temples weighing 450 [[Mithqal|mithqals]]. It was allowed by everyone who saw it to be a wonder that had never been heard of. About the attack on Thanesar, [[Tarikh Yamini|Utbi]] wrote "The blood of the infidels flowed so copiously that the stream was discoloured, notwithstanding its purity, and people were unable to drink it."<ref>{{cite web | title=The History of India |year = 1869| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZBkGsFMrxcC&q=Utbi%2C+The+blood+of+the+infidels+flowed+so+copiously+that+the+stream+was+discoloured%2C+notwithstanding+its+purity%2C+and+people+were+unable+to+drink+it.&pg=PA40| last1=Elliot | first1=Henry M. }}</ref>[[File:Sheikh Chilli's Tomb HR.JPG|thumb|Sheikh Chilli's Tomb]]
