It is the prefecture of the [[Regions of France|region]] of [[Normandy (administrative region)|Normandy]] and the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Seine-Maritime]]. Formerly one of the largest and most prosperous cities of [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], the population of the metropolitan area ({{langx|fr|[[functional area (France)|aire d'attraction]]}}) is 702,945 (2018).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/1405599?geo=AAV2020-015+UU2020-00755+COM-76540|title=Comparateur de territoire|publisher=[[INSEE]]|access-date=16 June 2022|archive-date=16 June 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220616110916/https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/1405599?geo=AAV2020-015+UU2020-00755+COM-76540|url-status=live}}</ref> People from Rouen are known as ''Rouennais''.

Rouen was the seat of the [[Exchequer of Normandy]] during the Middle Ages. It was one of the capitals of the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] and [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin]] dynasties, which ruled both [[England]] and large parts of modern France from the 11th to the 15th centuries. From the [[13th century]] onwards, the city experienced a remarkable economic boom, thanks in particular to the development of textile factories and river trade. Claimed by both the French and the English during the [[Hundred Years' War]], it was on its soil that [[Joan of Arc]] was tried and burned alive on 30 May 1431. Severely damaged by the wave of [[Operation Overlord|bombing in 1944]], it nevertheless regained its [[economic dynamism]] in the post-war period thanks to its industrial sites and its large seaport, which merged with the ports of Le Havre and Paris in 2021 to form the HAROPA Port.<ref name="haropa">{{Cite web |date=10 March 2023 |title=Our history |url=https://www.haropaport.com/en/our-history |access-date=26 June 2024 |website=HAROPA Port}}</ref>

Endowed with a prestige established during the [[France in the Middle Ages|medieval era]], and with a long architectural heritage in its historical monuments, Rouen is an important cultural capital. Several renowned establishments are located here, such as the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen|Museum of Fine Arts]], Le Secq des Tournelles museum, and [[Rouen Cathedral]].

Seat of an [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rouen|archdiocese]], it also hosts a court of appeal and a [[University of Rouen|university]]. Every four to six years, Rouen becomes the showcase for a large gathering of sailing ships called "L'Armada"; this event makes the city an occasional capital of the maritime world.

==History==
{{main|History of Rouen}}
{{For timeline}}

Rouen was founded by the [[Gaul]]ish tribe of the [[Veliocasses]], who controlled a large area in the lower Seine valley. They called it ''Ratumacos''; the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] called it ''Rotomagus''. It was considered the second city of [[Gallia Lugdunensis]] after [[Lugdunum]] ([[Lyon]]) itself. Under the reorganization of [[Diocletian]], Rouen was the chief city of the divided province Gallia Lugdunensis II and reached the apogee of its Roman development, with an amphitheatre and ''[[thermae]]'' of which foundations remain. In the 5th century, it became the seat of a bishopric and later a capital of [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Neustria]].

From their first incursion into the lower valley of the Seine in 841, the [[Normans]] overran Rouen.  From 912, Rouen was the capital of the [[Duchy of Normandy]] and residence of the [[duke of Normandy|local dukes]], until [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] moved his residence to [[Caen]].<ref>Stratford, Jenny., and British Archaeological Association. ''Medieval Art, Architecture, and Archaeology at Rouen''. Conference Transactions for the Year ... ; 1986. London]: British Archaeological Association, 1993.</ref> In 1150, Rouen received its founding charter which permitted [[Self-governance|self-government]].

During the 12th century, Rouen was the site of a [[yeshiva]] known as [[:fr:Maison sublime|La Maison Sublime]]. Discovered in 1976, it is now a museum.<ref>{{Cite web |last=<!--Not stated--> |title=Sauvons La Maison Sublime de l'oubli |url=http://www.lamaisonsublime.fr/ |access-date=2019-09-04 |website=La Maison Sublime de Rouen |language=fr |archive-date=3 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202539/http://www.lamaisonsublime.fr/ |url-status=live }}</ref> At that time, about 6,000 Jews lived in the town, comprising about 20% of the population.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

On 24 June 1204, King [[Philip II of France|Philip II Augustus]] of France entered Rouen and definitively annexed Normandy to the [[France in the Middle Ages|French Kingdom]]. He demolished the Norman castle and replaced it with his own, the [[Château Bouvreuil]], built on the site of the [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] amphitheatre.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}} A textile industry developed based on wool imported from England, for which the cities of Flanders and Brabant were constantly competitors, and finding its market in the [[Champagne fairs]]. Rouen also depended for its prosperity on the river traffic of the Seine, on which it enjoyed a monopoly that reached as far upstream as [[Paris]].{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

In the 13th and 14th centuries urban strife threatened the city: in 1291, the mayor was assassinated and noble residences in the city were pillaged. [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] reimposed order and suppressed the city's charter and the lucrative monopoly on river traffic, but he was quite willing to allow the Rouennais to repurchase their old liberties in 1294.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}} In 1306, he decided to expel the Jewish community of Rouen, then numbering some five or six thousand. In 1389, another urban revolt of the underclass occurred, the ''[[Harelle]]''. It was suppressed with the withdrawal of Rouen's charter and river-traffic privileges once more.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

During the [[Hundred Years' War]], on 19 January 1419, Rouen surrendered after a long [[Siege_of_Rouen_(1418–1419)|siege]] to [[Henry V of England]], who annexed [[Normandy]] once again to the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet domains]]. Rouen did not go quietly: [[Alain Blanchard]] hanged English prisoners from the walls, for which he was summarily executed after the city surrendered, while [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] and [[Vicar general|Vicar General]] of Rouen Robert de Livet became a hero for excommunicating the English king, resulting in de Livet's imprisonment for five years in England.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}} [[Joan of Arc]], who supported a return to French rule, was [[Death by burning|burned at the stake]] on 30 May 1431 in this city, where most inhabitants supported the duke of Burgundy, the French king's enemy. The king of France, [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]], recaptured the town in 1449.

Rouen was staunchly Catholic during the [[French Wars of Religion]], and underwent an unsuccessful [[Siege of Rouen (1591)|five-month siege]] in 1591/2 by the Protestant [[King Henry IV of France]] and an English force commanded by [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|the Earl of Essex]].
A brief account by an English participant has survived. See 'Memoirs of Robert Carey', (F.H.Mares (ed.), Oxford, 1972), pp.&nbsp;18–21.

The first competitive motor race ran from Paris to Rouen in 1894.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

During the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation in World War II]], the [[Kriegsmarine]] had its headquarters located in a chateau on what is now the [[École supérieure de commerce de Rouen|Rouen Business School]]. The city was heavily damaged during the same war on [[Normandy Landings|D-day]], and its famed cathedral was almost destroyed by Allied bombs.

Rouen is known for [[Rouen Cathedral]], with its ''Tour de Beurre'' (''butter tower'') financed by the sale of [[indulgences]] for the consumption of butter during [[Lent]]. The cathedral's gothic façade (completed in the 16th century) was the subject of [[Rouen Cathedral (Monet)|a series of paintings]] by [[Claude Monet]], some of which are exhibited in the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris.

The ''[[Gros Horloge]]'' is an [[astronomical clock]] dating back to the 14th century.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Miller |first=Derek |date=5 August 2017 |title=Normandy full of beauty and history |publisher=Delaware State News |url=http://delawarestatenews.net/people/normandy-full-of-beauty-and-history/}}</ref> It is located in the [[Rue du Gros-Horloge|Gros Horloge street]].

Other famous structures include [[Rouen Castle]], whose keep is known as the ''tour Jeanne d'Arc'', where [[Joan of Arc]] was brought in 1431 to be threatened with torture (contrary to popular belief, she was not imprisoned there but in the ''tour de lady Pucelle''(since destroyed); the ''[[Church of St. Ouen, Rouen|Church of Saint Ouen]]'' (12th–15th century); the ''[[courthouse|Palais de Justice]]'', which was once the seat of the ''[[Parlement]]'' (French court of law) of Normandy; the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] ''[[Church of Saint-Maclou|Church of St Maclou]]'' (15th century); and the Museum of Fine Arts and Ceramics which contains a splendid collection of [[Faience|faïence]] and [[porcelain]] for which Rouen was renowned during the 16th to 18th centuries. Rouen is also noted for its surviving [[Timber framing|half-timbered]] buildings.

This is a large, modern structure which dominates the square. The form of the building represents an upturned [[Viking]] boat and a fish shape.<ref>[[:fr:Église Sainte-Jeanne-d'Arc de Rouen]]</ref>

Rouen was also home to the [[French Grand Prix]], hosting the race at the nearby [[Rouen-Les-Essarts]] track sporadically between 1952 and 1968. In 1999 Rouen authorities demolished the grandstands and other remnants of Rouen's racing past. Today, little remains beyond the public roads that formed the circuit.

Rouen has an [[Rouen Opera House|opera house]], whose formal name is "Rouen Normandy Opera House – Theatre of Arts" (in French: ''Opéra de Rouen Normandie – Théâtre des arts'').

==Representations in art==
[[File:RouenCathedral Monet 1894.jpg|thumb|175px|Rouen Cathedral, Full Sunlight, by [[Claude Monet]], 1894.]]
[[Rouen cathedral (Monet painting)|Rouen Cathedral]] is the subject of a series of paintings by the [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] painter [[Claude Monet]], who painted the same scene at different times of the day. Two paintings are in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C.; two are in the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow; one is in the [[National Museum of Serbia]] in Belgrade. The estimated value of one painting is over $40&nbsp;million.

==Heraldry==
{{Blazon-arms
| img1=Arms of Rouen.svg
| legend1=Arms of Rouen
| text=The arms of Rouen are [[blazon]]ed :<br />Gules, a [[pascal lamb]], haloed and contorny, holding a banner argent charged with a cross Or, and on a chief azure, 3 [[Fleur-de-lis|fleurs de lys]] Or
This may be rendered, "On a red background a haloed white pascal lamb looking back over its shoulder (''contorny'') holds a white banner bearing a gold cross; above, a broad blue band across the top bears 3 gold fleurs de lis".<br>
On the front of the "Grand Poste" (rue Jeanne d'Arc), the banner is charged with a leopard (the lion passant seen on Norman and English arms). This was the official seal of Rouen at the beginning of the 12th century, before Normandy was incorporated into Capetian France.
