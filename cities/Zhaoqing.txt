'''Zhaoqing''' ({{zh|c=肇庆}}), [[postal map romanization|alternately]] [[romanization of Chinese|romanized]] as '''Shiuhing''',{{NoteTag|Other alternate romanizations include '''Shiu{{nbsp}}Hing''' and '''Shaou King'''.{{sfnp|Bolton & al.|1941|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6irEoGgDrm4C&pg=PA262 262]}}}} is a [[prefecture-level city]] in [[Guangdong]] [[Province (China)|Province]], China. As of the [[2020 Chinese census|2020 census]], its population was 4,113,594, with 1,553,109 living in the built-up (or metro) area made of [[Duanzhou District|Duanzhou]], [[Dinghu District|Dinghu]] and [[Gaoyao District|Gaoyao]].<ref name="citypopulation.de" /> The prefectural seat—except the [[Seven Star Crags]]—is fairly flat, but thickly forested mountains lie just outside its limits. Numerous rice paddies and aquaculture ponds are found on the outskirts of the city. [[Sihui]] and the southern districts of the prefecture are considered part of the [[Pearl River Delta]].

Formerly one of the most important cities in [[South China|southern China]], Zhaoqing lost its importance during the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasty and is now primarily known for tourism and as a provincial "college town". Residents from [[Guangzhou]], [[Shenzhen]], and the other cities of the [[Pearl River Delta]] often visit it for weekend excursions. It is also a growing manufacturing center.

==Name==
Zhaoqing was known to the [[Qin Empire|Qin]] as '''Sihui'''（四会） and [[Han Empire|Han]] as '''Gaoyao''' (高要). It was renamed '''Duanzhou''' (端州) from its role as the seat of [[Duan Prefecture]] under the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=the Yearbook 2023 of Zhaoqing |first1= |title=historial culture |url=https://www.zhaoqing.gov.cn/mczq/gczs/lsyg/content/post_2952270.html | publisher=Zhaoqing Government}}</ref> The present name, meaning "Beginning Auspiciousness", was bestowed on the area by [[Emperor Huizong of Song China|Emperor Huizong]] of the [[Song dynasty|Song]] in 1118. "Zhaoqing" is the [[pinyin]] romanization; the earlier [[Chinese Postal Map|Postal Map]] form "Shiuhing" derives from the name's [[Cantonese language|Cantonese pronunciation]].

==History==
[[File:牌坊广场全景.jpg|thumb|Panorama of Paifang Guangchang.]]
[[File:新世界花园楼盘.JPG|thumb|Xinshijie Huayuan residential area.]]
[[File:Zhaoqing-7stars.JPG|thumb|View of the city center from Seven Star Crags (七星岩).]]
[[Gaoyao District|Gaoyao]] was located on the south bank of the [[Xi River]], named for its district's principal feature: the river's [[Lingyang Gorge]] (then known as "Gaoyao"). In the late 6th and early 7th centuries, the administration was relocated to [[Duanzhou District|Duanzhou]] on the opposite bank of the river, which became an important administrative and military center of the southern [[Sui Empire]].

The {{ill|city wall of Zhaoqing|zh|肇庆古城墙}} was built in Duanzhou during the reign of [[Emperor Renzong of Song]] (1022–1063).

When the [[Portuguese in China|Portuguese]] arrived in the 16th century, Zhaoqing was still an important center, serving as the seat of the [[Viceroy of Liangguang]] ([[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]]).<ref name=ricci136>''[[De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas]]'', Book Two, Chapter 3. Pages 136 in the English translation: Louis J. Gallagher (1953). "China in the Sixteenth Century: The Journals of Matteo Ricci", Random House, New York, 1953. The original Latin text by [[Nicolas Trigault]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=iLsWAAAAQAAJ De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas suscepta ab Societate Jesu], can be found on [[Google Books]].</ref> [[Matteo Ricci]]'s ''[[On the Christian Expedition among the Sinae]]'' tells of the early visits of [[Macao|Macanese]]-based Europeans to Zhaoqing. The Viceroy [[Chen Rui]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|陈|瑞}}}}){{NoteTag|Matteo's "Cinsui".}} summoned Macao's [[governor of Macao|mayor]] and [[bishop of Macao|bishop]] in the early 1580s, but the town sent its auditor [[Mattia Penella]] and the Italian [[Jesuit missions to China|Jesuit]] [[Michele Ruggieri]] in their place in 1582.<ref>Gallagher (trans.), p. 136.</ref> After several false starts, Ruggieri and [[Matteo Ricci]] were allowed to establish their residence in the city, the first Jesuit mission house on [[mainland China]], after Zhaoqing's governor [[Wang Pan]] learned of Ricci's skill as a mathematician and cartographer. Ricci drew the first modern Chinese map of the world in Zhaoqing in 1584. Ruggieri left for Rome in 1588 but Ricci remained until the next year, when a new viceroy expelled him from the city and obliged the Jesuits to relocate to Shaozhou (now [[Shaoguan]]).<ref>Gallagher (trans.), pp. 205-229.</ref>

During the [[Fall of the Ming]] in the mid-17th century, Zhaoqing served as the capital of the [[Zhu Youlang, Prince of Gui|Prince of Gui]]'s [[Southern Ming dynasty|Southern Ming]] resistance, with the prince styling himself the Yongli Emperor. The town fell in 1650 and the prince relocated to [[Guilin]] and then various locations in [[Guangxi]], [[Yunnan]], and [[Burma]]. The Jesuits [[Andreas Wolfgang Koffler]] and, later, [[Michał Boym]] stayed for some time at his court.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=067On0JgItAC&pg=722 Andreas Wolfgang Koffler] in ''The Dictionary of the Ming Biography'', pp. 722-723</ref><ref name="Mungello139">{{cite book  | last =Mungello  | first =David E.   | title =Curious Land: Jesuit Accommodation and the Origins of Sinology  | publisher =University of Hawaii Press  | year =1989  | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=wb4yPw4ZgZQC | isbn=0-8248-1219-0  | page =139 }}</ref>

The Qing viceroy of Liangguang relocated to [[Guangzhou]] but Zhaoqing remained a [[fu (administrative division)|commandery seat]], overseeing the counties of [[Gaoyao District|Gaoyao]], [[Guangning County|Guangning]], [[Deqing County, Guangdong|Deqing]], [[Sihui]], and [[Kaijian County|Kaijian]] and [[Fengchuan County|Fengchuan]] (since combined into [[Fengkai County|Fengkai]]); [[Gaoming District|Gaoming]] (now part of [[Foshan]]); [[Xinxing County|Xinxing]] (now part of [[Yunfu]]); [[Heshan, Guangdong|Heshan]], [[Kaiping]], and [[Enping]] (now part of [[Jiangmen]]); and [[Yangchun]] and [[Yangjiang]] (now part of Yangjiang's separate prefecture).{{sfnp|Bolton & al.|1941|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6irEoGgDrm4C&pg=PA262 262]}}
