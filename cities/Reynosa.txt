The city is located on the southern bank of the [[Rio Grande]] in the international [[Reynosa–McAllen metropolitan area]], directly across the [[Mexico–United States border]] from [[Hidalgo, Texas]].

As of 2020, the city of Reynosa has a population of 691,557.<ref name="Mexico Census"/><ref>{{Cite web |title=Reynosa (Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map, Location, Weather and Web Information |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/mexico/tamaulipas/reynosa/280320001__reynosa/ |access-date=2024-02-01 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref>  If the [[floating population]] is included, the total can reach approximately 1,000,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=INEGI contó mal en Reynosa: Alcalde|url=http://www.hoytamaulipas.net/notas/31372/INEGI-conto-mal-en-Reynosa-Alcalde.html|newspaper=Hoy Tamaulipas|date=4 December 2011}}</ref>

==History==
On 6 July 1686, Agustín Echeverz y Zuvízar, governor of the ''[[New Kingdom of León|Nuevo Reino de León]],'' camped in what is now Reynosa during an exploratory expedition.

In December 1748, an expedition led by [[José de Escandón, 1st Count of Sierra Gorda|José de Escandón y Helguera]] left from [[Querétaro]], planning to establish 14 villages; the caravan consisted of 1500 colonists and 755 soldiers.

On 14 March 1749, was founded (in its original location) the ''Villa de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de Reynosa,'' by the captain Carlos Cantú on behalf of Escandón, being as well in political and military command. There were 279 pioneer residents in the charge of Friar Agustín Fragoso.

The city was named ''Reynosa'' after [[Reinosa]], birthplace of the viceroy [[Juan Francisco de Güemes, 1st Count of Revillagigedo|Juan Francisco de Güemes y Horcasitas.]]

In August 1750, the first flood was documented in the village.

In April 1757, Reynosa had it first political conflict, when Escandón dismissed Carlos Cantú as the mayor of the village, replacing him by Pedro de Estrada, second mayor of Reynosa.

On 9 July 1757, arrives to the village the captain José Tineda y Cuervo and the engineer Agustín López, both viceroyalty inspectors, to do a population census according to which Reynosa had 280 inhabitants.

As a result of the census, they obtained authorization from the King of Spain to move the village to a placed named Santa María de las Lajas, which was not done because Escandón didn't consider the river a flooding risk anymore.

In September 1800, an immense flood occurred. The village was inundated and the villagers used canoes and rafts to arrive to the hills of ''El Morrillo.'' In 1802, the village moved to its current location and the new census showed 1631 inhabitants.

In 1810, the building of the old church ''Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe'' began, by the parish priest Don José Cárdenas; it was finished in 1815 by Don Lorenzo Treviño.

In 1846, Reynosa was invaded by the American army during the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican-American war]]. On 10 May 1910, General [[Lucio Blanco]] with the [[Constitutional Army|constitutional army]] took Reynosa during the [[Mexican Revolution|Mexican revolution.]]

On 24 November 1926, Reynosa became a city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Reynosa |url=https://www.tamaulipas.gob.mx/estado/municipios/reynosa/ |access-date=2023-03-01 |website=Gobierno del Estado de Tamaulipas |language=es}}</ref>
