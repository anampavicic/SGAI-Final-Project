'''Choluteca''' is one of the 18 [[Departments of Honduras|departments]] ''(departamentos)'' into which [[Honduras]] is divided. The departmental capital is the city of [[Choluteca, Choluteca|Choluteca]]. The [[Choluteca River]] runs through the department.

== History ==
In the [[Mesoamerican Classic period]], the indigenous Cholutecas were engaged in trade in a vast territory encompassing the south of [[Mexico]], [[Belize]], [[Guatemala]], parts of [[El Salvador]] and [[Nicaragua]]. In the exercise of this industry they reached the South Coast of [[Honduras]], and founded the settlement of what is now the city of [[Choluteca, Choluteca|Choluteca]] hundreds of years before the Spanish conquest.

Choluteca was created as a division of colonial rule from Guatemala in March 1535. Upon independence from Spain, the department of Choluteca was created on June 28, 1825, as one of the seven original departments in which Honduras was divided after independence during the government of the first head of state of Honduras, [[Dionisio de Herrera]]. Its borders were changed twice after the original partition. In 1843 the district of Guascorán was added to its territory, until then part of [[Comayagua Department|Comayagua]]. In 1893 its westernmost part was split, with the creation of the [[Valle Department|Valle department]].{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

== Geography ==
Choluteca is the southernmost department of Honduras with an area of 4360&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. In 2015 it had an estimated population of 447,852 inhabitants.<ref name="INE" /> Chuleteca has many lands that are used for agriculture, fishing, sugar production, and shrimp farms. The head of the department is the city of [[Choluteca, Choluteca|Choluteca]], which is located on the Choluteca river that crosses the department. One crosses the Choluteca Bridge to enter the city.

Choluteca is bordered to the north by the departments of [[Francisco Morazán Department|Francisco Morazán]] and [[El Paraíso Department|El Paraíso]], to the west by the [[Golfo de Fonseca]] and the department of [[Valle Department|Valle]], and to the east and south by [[Nicaragua]].
