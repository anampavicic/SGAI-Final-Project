'''Kindu''' is a [[Cities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|city]] in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], the capital of [[Maniema]] province. It has a population of about 200,000 and is situated on the [[Lualaba River]] at an altitude of about 500 metres, and is about 400&nbsp;km west of [[Bukavu]].

Kindu is linked by rail to the mining areas of [[Kalemie]], [[Kamina]] and [[Kananga]] to the south. It also has an [[Kindu Airport|airport]] with a 2,200 metre runway and has historically been an important port along the [[Congo River]] system.

[[File:Ikondu village.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ikondu village as seen by Stanley]]
The town was an important centre for the [[ivory]], [[gold]] and the [[History of slavery|slave trade]] during the nineteenth century. [[Arab]]-[[Swahili people|Swahili]] slave traders were based here from about 1860 and sent caravans overland to [[Zanzibar]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://global.britannica.com/place/Kindu|title=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref>

[[Henry Morton Stanley]] came upon "this remarkable town" on 5 Dec. 1876, describing it as "remarkably long" with a "broad street, thirty feet wide, and two miles in length" and "behind the village were the banana and the palm groves."<ref name=Stanley>Stanley, H.M., 1899, Through the Dark Continent, London: G. Newnes, Vol. One {{ISBN|0486256677}}, Vol. Two {{ISBN|0486256685}}</ref>{{rp|Vol.Two,132–133}}
