'''Bishkek''',{{efn|{{langx|ky|Бишкек|Bişkek}}, {{IPA-ky|biʃˈkek|IPA}}; {{langx|ru|Бишкек}}, {{IPA|ru|bʲɪʂˈkʲek|IPA}}}} formerly known as '''Frunze''', and before that '''Pishpek''', is the [[Capital city|capital]] and largest city of [[Kyrgyzstan]]. Bishkek is also the administrative centre of the [[Chüy Region]].{{efn|The region surrounds the city, although the city itself is not part of the region but rather a region-level unit of Kyrgyzstan.}} Bishkek is situated near the [[Kazakhstan–Kyrgyzstan border|border with Kazakhstan]] and has a population of 1,074,075, as of 2021.<ref name=pop21>{{cite Kyrgyzstan population 2021}}</ref>

The [[Khanate of Kokand]] established the fortress of Pishpek in 1825 to control local caravan routes and to collect tribute from [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] tribes. On 4 September 1860, with the approval of the Kyrgyz, Russian forces led by Colonel Apollon Zimmermann destroyed the fortress. In the present day, the fortress ruins can be found just north of Jibek jolu Street, near the new main mosque.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bishkek – Central Asia Guide|url=https://central-asia.guide/kyrgyzstan/destinations-kg/bishkek/|website=Central Asia Guide}}</ref> A Russian settlement was established in 1868 on the site of the fortress under its original name, Pishpek. It lay within the General Governorship of [[Russian Turkestan]] and its [[Semirechye Oblast]].

The [[Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast]] was established in 1925 in Russian Turkestan, promoting Pishpek to its capital. In 1926, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] renamed the city ''Frunze'', after [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] military leader [[Mikhail Frunze]] (1885–1925), who was born there. Frunze became the capital of the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic]] in 1936, during the final stages of [[national delimitation in the Soviet Union]]. In 1991, the [[Kyrgyz parliament]] changed the capital's name to Bishkek.

Bishkek is situated at an altitude of about {{convert|800|m}}, just off the northern fringe of the [[Kyrgyz Ala-Too Range]], an extension of the [[Tian Shan]] mountain range. These mountains rise to a height of {{convert|4895|m}}. North of the city, a fertile and gently undulating steppe extends far north into neighboring [[Kazakhstan]]. The river [[Chu (river)|Chüy]] drains most of the area. Bishkek is connected to the [[Turkestan–Siberia Railway]] by a [[spur line]].

Bishkek is a city of wide boulevards and marble-faced public buildings combined with numerous [[Khrushchevka|Soviet-style apartment blocks]] surrounding interior courtyards. There are also thousands of smaller, privately built houses, mostly outside the city centre. Streets follow a grid pattern, with most flanked on both sides by narrow irrigation channels, which provide water to trees which provide shade during the hot summers.

== Etymology ==
Bishkek is supposedly named after the paddle used to churn fermenting milk.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bishkek Capital of Islamic Culture 2014 |url=https://www.icesco.org/en/bishkek-capital-of-islamic-culture-2014/ |access-date=2022-11-11 |website=ICESCO-En |language=en-US |archive-date=11 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221111190636/https://www.icesco.org/en/bishkek-capital-of-islamic-culture-2014/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=2022-03-26 |title=In Kyrgyzstan, a taste of the 'purest milk imaginable' |work=Financial Times |url=https://www.ft.com/content/5efd328e-bcdd-41ec-96c1-1aec00f38d74 |access-date=2022-11-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=21 July 2022 |title=This Asian country is betting on fermented horse milk to attract tourists |url=https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/kyrgyzstan-kumis-fermented-milk-intl-hnk/index.html |access-date=2022-11-11 |website=CNN |language=en}}</ref>

The official website of the Bishkek's city hall provides the following etymological justification for the name of the city: the pregnant wife of a hero lost a paddle used to churn [[kumis]]. While looking for it, she suddenly gave birth to a boy, who she named Bishkek. Bishkek would grow up to be a noble figure and after his death, was buried on a mound near the banks of the [[Alamüdün (river)|Alamüdün]]. There, a tombstone was erected. The building was seen and described by travelers of the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref>{{Cite web |title=История города |url=http://www.meria.kg/ru/history |access-date=2022-11-11 |website=Мэрия |language=ru}}</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Bishkek}}

Based on DNA evidence, the area near Bishkek is considered one of the possible origins of the [[Black Death]] between AD 1346 and 1353.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/black-death-plague-that-killed-50-million-in-europe-began-in-central-asia-study-shows-11655305200 | title=Black Death Mystery Solved Centuries After Plague Killed 50 Million in Europe | newspaper=Wall Street Journal | date=15 June 2022 | last1=Woodward | first1=Aylin }}</ref>

===Kokhand rule===
Originally a caravan rest stop, possibly founded by the [[Sogdia]]ns, on one of the branches of the [[Silk Road]] through the [[Tian Shan]] range, the location was fortified in 1825 by the [[khan of Kokand]] with a mud fort. In the last years of Kokhand rule, the Pishpek fortress was led by [[Atabeg|Atabek]], [[Kurmanjan Datka|the Datka]]. In 1844, the forces of [[Ormon Khan]], the leader of the {{Ill|Кыргыз хандыгы|lt=Kara-Kyrgyz Khanate|ky}}, briefly captured the fortress.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Belyakov |first=Yuri |date=2020 |title=Ормон-хан |trans-title=Ormon Khan |url=https://proza.ru/2020/05/02/745 |access-date=2022-10-05 |website=proza.ru |language=ru}}</ref>

===Tsarist era===
In 1860, [[Imperial Russia]] annexed the area, and the military forces of Colonel Apollon Zimmerman took and razed the fort. Colonel Zimmermann rebuilt the town over the destroyed fort and appointed field-Poruchik Titov as head of a new Russian garrison. The Imperial Russian government redeveloped the site from 1877 onward, encouraging the settlement of Russian peasants by giving them fertile land to develop.

===Soviet era===
[[File:Michael Frunze Statue vor dem Bahnhof von Bischkek.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|right|Statue of [[Mikhail Frunze]] near the railway station]]
In 1926, the city became the capital of the newly established [[Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast|Kirghiz ASSR]] and was renamed Frunze after [[Mikhail Frunze]], [[Lenin]]'s close associate who was born in Bishkek and played key roles during the [[1905 Russian Revolution|revolutions of 1905]] and [[Russian Revolution|1917]] and during the [[Russian Civil War]] of the early 1920s.

===Independence era===
The early 1990s were a tumultuous time for Bishkek. In June 1990, a state of emergency was declared following severe ethnic riots in southern Kyrgyzstan that threatened to spread to the capital. The city was renamed Bishkek on 5 February 1991, and Kyrgyzstan achieved independence later that year during the [[breakup of the Soviet Union]]. Before independence, the majority of Bishkek's population were ethnic [[Russians]]. In 2004, Russians made up approximately 20% of the city's population, and about {{nowrap|7–8%}} in 2011.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3681/is_200407/ai_n9472919 Residential Real Estate Market in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan: Current Conditions and Prospects]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321113715/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3681/is_200407/ai_n9472919 |date=21 March 2009 }}</ref>

Bishkek is Kyrgyzstan's financial centre, with all of the country's 21 commercial banks headquartered there. During the Soviet era, the city was home to many industrial plants, but most have been shut down since 1991 or now operate on a much-reduced scale. One of Bishkek's largest employment centres today is the [[Dordoy Bazaar]] open market, where many of the Chinese goods imported to [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries are sold.

==Geography==

===Orientation===
Although Bishkek itself is relatively young, its surrounding area has some sites of interest dating to prehistoric times. There are also sites from the [[Greco-Buddhist art|Greco-Buddhist]] period, the period of [[Church of the East|Nestorian]] influence, the era of the Central Asian ''[[khanate]]s'', and the Soviet period.<ref>{{Cite web |first= |title=Bishkek: The City of Lenin and the White House {{!}} .TR |url=https://www.tourism-review.com/travel-tourism-magazine-bishkek-the-city-of-lenin-and-the-white-house-article765 |access-date=2022-06-08 |website=www.tourism-review.com |language=en}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=July 2022}}
[[File:Russian Orthodox cathedral in Bishkek.jpg|thumb|Russian Orthodox cathedral of the Holy Resurrection]]
The central part of the city is laid out on a rectangular grid plan. The city's main street is the east-west Chüy Avenue ([[Chüy Prospekti]]), named after the region's [[Chu (river)|main river]]. In the Soviet era, it was called [[Lenin]] Avenue. Along or near it are many important government buildings and universities. These include the [[Kyrgyz Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] compound. The westernmost section of the avenue is known as [[Deng Xiaoping]] Avenue.

The main north–south street is [[Leadership of Communist Kyrgyzstan|Yusup Abdrakhmanov]] Street, still commonly referred to by its old name, Sovietskaya Street. Its northern and southern sections are called, respectively, Yelebesov and Baityk Batyr Streets. Several major shopping centres are located along with it, and in the north, it provides access to [[Dordoy Bazaar]].

Erkindik ("Freedom") Boulevard runs from north to south, from the main railroad station (Bishkek II) south of Chüy Avenue to the museum quarter and sculpture park just north of Chüy Avenue, and further north toward the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the past, it was called Dzerzhinsky Boulevard, named after a Communist revolutionary, [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]], and its northern continuation is still called Dzerzhinsky Street.

An important east–west street is Jibek Jolu ('[[Silk Road]]'). It runs parallel to Chüy Avenue about {{Cvt|2|km}} north of it and is part of the main east–west road of [[Chüy Region]]. Both the eastern and western bus terminals are located along Jibek Jolu.

There is a Roman Catholic church located at ul. Vasiljeva 197 (near Rynok Bayat). It is the only Catholic cathedral in Kyrgyzstan.<ref>[http://www.catholic-kyrgyzstan.org/ Catholic Church in Kyrgyzstan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803091208/http://www.catholic-kyrgyzstan.org/ |date=3 August 2019 }}.

A stadium named in honour of Dolon Omurzakov is located near the centre of Bishkek. This is the largest stadium in the Kyrgyz Republic.

===City centre===
* [[Kyrgyz State Historical Museum]], located in [[Ala-Too Square]], the main city square.
* State Museum of Applied Arts, containing examples of traditional Kyrgyz [[handicraft|handicrafts.]]
* Frunze House Museum.
* Statue of [[Ivan Panfilov]] in the park near the [[White House, Bishkek|White House]].
* An [[equestrian statue]] of [[Mikhail Frunze]] stands in a large park (Boulevard Erkindik) across from the train station.
* The train station was built in 1946 by German [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] and has survived since then without further renovation or repairs; most of those who built it perished and were buried in unmarked pits near the station. {{citation needed|date=October 2022}}
* The main government building, the White House, is a large seven-story marble building and the former headquarters of the Communist Party of the [[Kirghiz SSR]].
* At [[Ala-Too Square]] there is an independence monument where the changing of the guards may be watched.
*[[Osh Bazaar]], west of the city centre, is a large, picturesque produce market.
*[[Kyrgyz National Philharmonic]], concert hall.

===Outer neighbourhoods===
The [[Dordoy Bazaar]], just inside the bypass highway on the north-eastern edge of the city, is a major retail and wholesale market.

===Outside the city===
The [[Kyrgyz Ala-Too Range|Kyrgyz Ala-Too mountain range]], some {{convert|40|km}} away, provides a spectacular backdrop to the city; the [[Ala Archa National Park]] is only a 30 to 45 minutes drive away.

===Distances===
Bishkek is about 300&nbsp;km away directly from the country's second largest city [[Osh]]. However, its nearest large city is [[Almaty]] of Kazakhstan, which is 190&nbsp;km to the east. Furthermore, it is 470&nbsp;km from [[Tashkent]] (Uzbekistan), 680&nbsp;km from [[Dushanbe]] (Tajikistan), and about 1,000&nbsp;km each from [[Astana]] (Kazakhstan), [[Ürümqi]] (China), [[Islamabad]] (Pakistan), and [[Kabul]] (Afghanistan).

===Climate===
Bishkek has a Mediterranean-influenced [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dsa''), as the average mean temperature in the winter is below {{cvt|0|C|1}}.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Koppen Map |url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Asia_K%C3%B6ppen_Map.png |access-date=21 November 2012 |publisher=Upload.wikimedia.org}}</ref> Average [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is around {{convert|440|mm}} per year. Average daily high temperatures range from {{Cvt|3|C|1}} in January to about {{cvt|31|C|1}} during July.<ref name=Pogoda/> The summer months are dominated by dry periods, punctuated by the occasional [[thunderstorm]], which produces strong gusty winds and rare [[dust storm]]s. The mountains to the south provide a natural boundary and protection from damaging weather, as does the smaller mountain chain that runs north-west to south-east. In the winter months, sparse [[Winter storm|snow storms]] and frequent heavy [[fog]] are the dominating features. There are sometimes temperature inversions, during which the fog can last for days at a time.

==Demographics==
Bishkek is the most populated city in Kyrgyzstan. Its population, estimated in 2021, was 1,074,075.<ref name=pop21/> From the foundation of the city to the mid-1990s, ethnic Russians and other peoples of European descent (Ukrainians, Germans) comprised the majority of the city's population. According to the 1970 census, the ethnic Kyrgyz were only 12.3%, while Europeans comprised more than 80% of the Frunze population. Now Bishkek is a predominantly Kyrgyz city, with 75% of its residents Kyrgyz, while European peoples make up around 15% of the population.<ref name="Table 1.13: Distribution of the resident population by individual nationalities at the beginning of 2020">{{cite web |title=Дем. ежегодник 2015-2019гг.xlsx |url=https://stat.gov.kg/media/publicationarchive/b87b13d4-7bc2-43bf-b4cc-6d1f12619db8.rar |publisher=National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic |access-date=19 September 2021}}</ref> Despite this fact, Russian is the main language while Kyrgyz continues losing ground, especially among the younger generations.<ref name="Ferdinand and Komlósi">{{Cite journal |title=Ferdinand, S. & Komlósi, F. 2016.

==Ecology and environment==

===Air quality===
Emissions of air pollutants in Bishkek amounted to 14,400 tons in 2010.<ref name="meteo.ktnet.kg">{{Cite web |title=Анализ загрязнения атмосферы |url=http://www.nature.kg/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=18&Itemid=11&lang=ru |access-date=21 November 2012 |publisher=Nature.kg |archive-date=9 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209054306/http://www.nature.kg/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=18&Itemid=11&lang=ru |url-status=dead }}</ref> Among all cities in Kyrgyzstan, the level of [[air pollution]] in Bishkek is the highest, occasionally exceeding maximum allowable concentrations by several times, especially in the city centre.<ref>[http://www.nature.kg/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=18&Itemid=11&lang=ru Web-site of the State Agency on Environment Protection and Forestry: Assessment of Air Pollution] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209054306/http://www.nature.kg/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=18&Itemid=11&lang=ru |date=9 February 2014 }}.

Responsibility for ambient air quality monitoring in Bishkek lies with the Kyrgyz State Agency of [[Hydrometeorology]]. There are seven air-quality monitoring stations in Bishkek, measuring levels of [[sulfur dioxide]], nitrogen oxides, formaldehyde, and [[ammonia]].<ref name="meteo.ktnet.kg" />

==Economy==
[[File:E7919-Dordoy-Bazaar-clothing.jpg|thumb|[[Dordoy Bazaar]]]]
Bishkek uses the Kyrgyzstan currency, the [[Kyrgyzstani som|som]]. The som's value fluctuates regularly but averaged around 85 som per U.S. dollar as of March 2023. The economy in Bishkek is primarily agricultural, and agricultural products are sometimes bartered in the outlying regions. The streets of Bishkek are regularly lined with produce vendors in a market-style venue. In most of the downtown area there is a more urban cityscape with banks, stores, markets, and malls. Sought-after goods include hand-crafted artisan pieces, such as statues, carvings, paintings, and many nature-based sculptures.

=== Housing ===
As with many cities in post-Soviet states, housing in Bishkek has undergone extensive changes since the collapse of the Soviet Union. While housing was formerly distributed to citizens in the Soviet era, housing in Bishkek has since become privatised.

Though single-family houses are slowly becoming more popular, the majority of the residents live in Soviet-era apartments. Despite the Kyrgyz economy experiencing growth, increases in available housing have been slow with very little new construction and a doubling of prices from 2001 to 2002.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Roseman |first=Gary |title=The Residential Real Estate Market in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan |journal=Real Estate Issues |volume=Summer 2004}}</ref> This changed by the 2010s when an unprecedented housing boom has transformed the city. By 2021, over 246 construction firms were active in Kyrgyzstan, primarily focusing on upscale residences, often marketed as 'business class' or 'premium class' accommodations.<ref name=":0" /> The southern part of the city, where a significant portion of new constructions is concentrated, faces a critical concern due to its proximity to the Issyk-Ata fault line.<ref name=":0" /> Compounded by the inadequately seismic-proof architecture of most of these buildings, this situation poses a serious threat to the safety of residents and has sparked criticism.<ref name="Leupold 1194–1221"/> Limited land availability propels private developers to encroach into socialist-era residential zones, resulting in the loss of green spaces and vital social infrastructure, including sports fields and playgrounds.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Leupold |first=David |date=2023-08-09 |title=Skyrise, Smog and Seismic Menace. In the El Dorado of Bishkek's Elite Housing |journal=Europe-Asia Studies |language=en |volume=75 |issue=7 |pages=1213–14 |doi=10.1080/09668136.2023.2185203 |issn=0966-8136|doi-access=free }}</ref>

Those unable to afford the high housing price within Bishkek, notably internal migrants from rural villages and small provincial towns, often have to resort to informal [[Squatting in Kyrgyzstan|squatter settlements]] on the city's outskirts such as Ak Jar, Ak Jol, Ak Örgö, Altyn Kazyk, Archa Beshik, Kalys-Ordo, Kayndy-2, Kelechek, Muras-Ordo and TETS-2 Yntymak.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Isabaeva |first=Eliza |date=2013 |title=Migration into the "Illegality" and Coping with Difficulties in a Squatter Settlement in Bishkek |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24364951 |journal=Zeitschrift für Ethnologie |volume=138 |issue=2 |pages=139–154 |jstor=24364951 |issn=0044-2666}}</ref> These urban settlements are estimated to house 400,000 people or about 30 percent of Bishkek's population. While many of the settlements have lacked basic necessities such as electricity and running water, recently, the local government has pushed to provide these services.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Isabaeva |first=Eliza |year=2013 |title=Migration into the "Illegality" and Coping with Difficulties in a Squatter Settlement in Bishkek |journal=Zeitschrift für Ethnologie |volume=138}}</ref>

==Government==
Local government is administered by the Bishkek Mayor's Office. [[Askarbek Salymbekov]] was mayor until his resignation in August 2005, after which his deputy, [[Arstanbek Nogoev]], took over the mayorship. Nogoev was in turn removed from his position in October 2007 through a decree of President [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]] and replaced by businessman and former first deputy prime minister [[Daniar Usenov]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=17 October 2007 |title=New mayor of Bishkek promises to solve capital's problems |publisher=The Times of Central Asia |url=http://www.timesca.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=182916&Itemid=7 |access-date=18 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619111339/http://www.timesca.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=182916&Itemid=7 |archive-date=19 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Marat |first=Erica |date=15 October 2007 |title=Upcoming referendum sinks Kyrgyzstan deeper into crisis |url=http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2372503 |journal=Eurasia Daily Monitor |publisher=The Jamestown Foundation |volume=4 |issue=190 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022122621/http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2372503 |archive-date=22 October 2007 |access-date=18 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=22 August 2005 |title=Kyrgyz capital gets new mayor |publisher=Radio Free Europe |url=http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/rferl/2005/05-08-22.rferl.html#20 |url-status=live |access-date=18 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605073147/http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/rferl/2005/05-08-22.rferl.html#20 |archive-date=5 June 2011}}</ref> In July 2008 former head of the Kyrgyz Railways [[Nariman Tuleyev]] was appointed mayor, who was dismissed by the interim government after 7 April 2010.

===Administrative divisions===
Bishkek city covers {{convert|169.6|km2|abbr=off}}<ref name="stat09" /> and is administered separately and not part of any region. Besides the city proper, one [[urban-type settlement]] and one village are administered by the city: [[Chong-Aryk, Bishkek|Chong-Aryk]] and [[Orto-Say]].<ref name="class" /> The city is divided into 4 districts: [[Birinchi May District, Bishkek|Birinchi May]], [[Lenin District, Bishkek|Lenin]], [[Oktyabr District, Bishkek|Oktyabr]] and [[Sverdlov District, Bishkek|Sverdlov]]. Chong-Aryk and Orto-Say are part of Lenin District.<ref name="class" /> Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, there has been discussion of [[Geographical renaming|replacing]] the Soviet era district names with ones that reflect Kyrgyz identity and history. Other former Soviet republics have widely replaced Soviet era place names; despite renaming the capital in 1991, Kyrgyzstan is the only nation in Central Asia to retain Soviet era names for districts in its capital.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Najibullah |first1=Farangis |title=Kyrgyz Politicians Annoyed Over Russian Anger At Possible Soviet-Era Name Changes |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/kyrgyzstan-bishkek-name-changes-russian-anger/32162907.html |access-date=6 December 2022 |work=Radio Free Europe |date=December 5, 2022}}</ref>

== Culture ==
Bishkek is culturally the country's most important city. It is home to the [[National Library of the Kyrgyz Republic]] as well as a number of museums, e.g.  the [[Kyrgyz State Historical Museum]] or the [[M. V. Frunze Museum]]. The national public broadcasting service KTRK or [[Kyrgyz Television]] is based in Bishkek. Newspapers in Bishkek include the English-language  [[Bishkek Observer]], the world's only [[Dungan language|dungan-language]] newspaper called [[Huimin bao]] and the  Russian-language [[Vecherniy Bishkek]] newspaper.

===Religion===
The largest religion is [[Sunni Islam]], but since many Russians live in Kyrgyzstan, there is also a large [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] community. The [[Bishkek Central Mosque]] is one of the largest in Central Asia. Bishkek is home to the Roman Catholic [[Apostolic Administration of Kyrgyzstan]].

===Sports===
Bishkek is home to [[Dolen Omurzakov Stadium]], the largest [[association football|football]] stadium in Kyrgyzstan and the only one eligible to host international matches.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120919015326/http://www.the-afc.com/en/member-association-news/central-a-south-asia-news/1924 Corporate Japanese companies to renovate Kyrgyzstan football stadium].

[[File:Bishkek Railway Station.jpg|thumb|[[Bishkek-2 railway station]]]]

===Mass public transport===
Public transportation includes buses, electric [[trolleybus]]es, and public vans (known in Russian as ''[[marshrutka]]''). The first bus and trolley bus services in Bishkek were introduced in 1934 and 1951, respectively.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Frunze. City Encyclopedia. |url=http://yiv1999.narod.ru/ABC_0040.htm#6300 |access-date=26 January 2014}}</ref>

Taxi cabs can be found throughout the city.

The city is considering designing and building a light rail system.

===Commuter and long-distance buses===
There are two main bus stations in Bishkek. The smaller old Eastern Bus Station is primarily the terminal for minibusses to various destinations within or just beyond the eastern suburbs, such as [[Kant, Kyrgyzstan|Kant]], [[Tokmok]], [[Kemin]], [[Issyk Ata]], or the [[Korday]] border crossing.

Long-distance regular bus and minibus services to all parts of the country, as well as to [[Almaty]] (the largest city in neighbouring [[Kazakhstan]]) and [[Kashgar]], China, run mostly from the newer grand Western Bus Station; only a smaller number run from the Eastern Station.

The Dordoy Bazaar on the north-eastern outskirts of the city also contains makeshift terminals for frequent minibusses to suburban towns in all directions (from [[Sokuluk]] in the west to [[Tokmok|Tokmak]] in the east) and to some buses taking traders to Kazakhstan and Siberia.

===Rail===
{{As of|2007}}, the [[Bishkek-2 railway station]] sees only a few trains a day. It offers a popular three-day train service from Bishkek to Moscow.

There are also long-distance trains that leave for Siberia ([[Novosibirsk]] and [[Novokuznetsk]]), via [[Almaty]], over the [[TurkSib]] route, and to [[Yekaterinburg]] (Sverdlovsk) in the Urals, via [[Astana]]. These services are remarkably slow (over 48 hours to Yekaterinburg), due to long stops at the border and the indirect route (the trains first have to go west for more than a {{convert|100|km}} before they enter the main TurkSib line and can continue to the east or north). For example, as of the fall of 2008, train No. 305 Bishkek-Yekaterinburg was scheduled to take 11 hours to reach the [[Shu, Jambyl|Shu]] junction—a distance of some {{convert|269|km}} by rail, and less than half of that by road.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Маршрут поезда ????? – ????? на сайте |url=http://www.poezda.net/ru/train_timetable?st_code=2708000&order=&forDate=3 |access-date=21 November 2012 |publisher=Poezda.net}}</ref>

===Air===
The city is served by [[Manas International Airport]] ([[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] code FRU), located approximately {{convert|25|km}} north-west of the city centre.

In 2001, the United States obtained the right to use Manas International Airport as an [[Transit Center at Manas|air base]] for its military operations in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dzyubenko |first=Olga |date=June 3, 2014 |title=U.S. vacates base in Central Asia as Russia's clout rises |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0EE1LG/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20240210094832/https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0EE1LG/ |archive-date=February 10, 2024 |access-date=February 10, 2024 |website=[[Reuters]]}}</ref> Russia subsequently (2003) established an airbase of its own ([[Kant (air base)|Kant Air Base]]) near [[Kant, Kyrgyzstan|Kant]], some {{convert|20|km}} east of Bishkek. It is based at a facility that used to be home to a major Soviet military pilot training school; one of its students, [[Hosni Mubarak]], later became president of [[Egypt]].
