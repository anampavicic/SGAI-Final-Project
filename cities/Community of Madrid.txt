The '''Community of Madrid''' ({{langx|es|Comunidad de Madrid}} {{IPA|es|komuniˈðað ðe maˈðɾið||ES-pe - Comunidad de madrid.ogg}}) is one of the seventeen [[autonomous communities]]<!--Ceuta and Melilla are autonomous cities but do not have autonomous parliaments, so counted separately--> of [[Spain]]. It is located in the centre of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], and of the [[Meseta Central|Central Plateau]] ({{lang|es|Meseta Central}}). Its capital and largest municipality is the [[Madrid|City of Madrid]], which is also the capital of the country. The Community of Madrid is bounded to the south and east by [[Castilla–La Mancha]] and to the north and west by [[Castile and León]]. It was formally created in 1983, in order to address the particular status of the City of Madrid as the national capital city and in urban hierarchy.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sinopsis del estatuto de Autonomía de la Comunidad de Madrid |url=https://app.congreso.es/consti/estatutos/sinopsis.jsp?com=74 |access-date=2023-11-16 |website=app.congreso.es}}</ref> Its limits are those of the province of Madrid, which was until then conventionally included in the historical region of [[New Castile (Spain)|New Castile]] (''Castilla la Nueva'').

The Community of Madrid is the third most populous in Spain with 7,058,041 (2024) inhabitants, roughly a seventh of the national total, mostly concentrated in the [[metropolitan area of Madrid]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://club.telepolis.com/geografo/regional/espa/madter.htm |title=La economía de la Comunidad de Madrid, una de las más potentes y dinámicas del país |access-date=2008-04-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217141302/http://club.telepolis.com/geografo/regional/espa/madter.htm |archive-date=2009-12-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It is also the most densely populated autonomous community.

The Community of Madrid is almost entirely comprised in the [[Tagus Basin]], from the [[Sistema Central|Central System]] (''Sistema Central'') reliefs in the north and northwest to the [[Tagus]] River bed in the southern border. The climate is generally temperate, ranging from [[Mediterranean climate|mediterranean]] to [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]], except in the Central System highlands. It contains four [[World Heritage Site]]s: the [[El Escorial|Monastery and Royal Site of El Escorial]], the university and historic centre of [[Alcalá de Henares]], the cultural landscape of [[Aranjuez]] and the [[Paseo del Prado]] and [[Parque del Buen Retiro, Madrid|Buen Retiro]] park in Madrid City. In addition, the {{interlanguage link|Montejo Beech Forest|es|Hayedo de Montejo}} is part of the transnational [[Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe]] world heritage site.

==Geography==
[[File:Comunidad de Madrid relieve location map.jpg|right|255px|Relief map of the Community of Madrid]]
Despite the existence of a large city of nearly 7 million people, the Community of Madrid still retains some remarkably unspoiled and diverse habitats and landscapes. Madrid is home to mountain peaks rising above 2,000 m, [[Quercus rotundifolia|holm oak]] dehesas and low-lying plains. The slopes of the [[Guadarrama mountain range]] are cloaked in dense forests of [[Scots pine]] and Pyrenean [[oak]]. The [[Lozoya Valley]] supports a large [[Eurasian black vulture|black (monk) vulture]] colony, and one of the last bastions of the [[Spanish imperial eagle]] in the world is found in the Park Regional del Suroeste in dehesa hills between the Gredos and Guadarrama ranges. The recent possible detection of the existence of [[Iberian lynx]] in the area between the [[Cofio River|Cofio]] and [[Alberche]] rivers is testament to the biodiversity of the area. Taking advantage of the orography, there are several reservoirs and local dams, with the [[Santillana reservoir]] being the largest.

[[File:Circo y cima de Peñalara1.JPG|left|thumb|[[Peñalara]]: the [[Guadarrama mountain range]]'s highest peak]]
When looking at a map of the province of Madrid, it can be seen that it is almost an equilateral triangle, in whose center would be the city. First, by the western side, it borders the "[[Sistema Central]]" (the [[Guadarrama mountain range]]), the southern border features a protrusion following the [[Tagus|Tagus River]] in order to include the royal site of [[Aranjuez]] in the region; the eastern edge of the triangle comes from the rupture of the fluvial river basins. This autonomous community is located in the basin of the Tagus River. The Tagus passes through the southern border of the Autonomy in its path west toward the [[Atlantic Ocean]], draining the waters of the [[Jarama River]] (collecting in turn the waters of the [[Lozoya River|Lozoya]], the [[Guadalix River|Guadalix]], the [[Manzanares River|Manzanares]], the [[Henares River|Henares]] and the [[Tajuña River|Tajuña]]), the [[Alberche]] and the [[Guadarrama River|Guadarrama]] in the Community.{{Sfn|Gallego Calvo|2011|p=414}}
[[File:Capra pyrenaica, La Pedriza, Madrid, España, 2016 09.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Capra pyrenaica|Iberian ibex]] (''Capra pyrenaica'') in [[La Pedriza]]]]
This autonomous community also includes the exclave of [[Dehesa de la Cepeda]] (part of the municipality of [[Santa María de la Alameda]]), a mostly open-area geographically located between the provinces of [[Province of Ávila|Ávila]] and [[Segovia]] in the autonomous community of [[Castile and Leon|Castile and León]].

The Province of Madrid occupies a surface area of approximately {{cvt|8,028|km2}} (1.6% of all Spanish territory). More specifically, the exact position of Madrid is 3° 40' of longitude west of [[Greenwich]], England, and 40° 23' north of the equator.

Most of the province lies between 600 and 1,000&nbsp;m above sea level. However, there the altitude ranges from 2,428&nbsp;metres of [[Peñalara]] to 430 metres at the Alberche river when it leaves [[Villa del Prado]] into the province of Toledo.{{Sfn|Ayllón López|Barbera Luna|2011|p=58}} Other considerable heights, as well as being famous, are the [[Bola del Mundo]] ("Ball of the World") in [[Navacerrada]], at a height of 2,258&nbsp;m, the [[Siete Picos]] ("Seven Peaks") in [[Cercedilla]], at 2,138&nbsp;m, and the [[Peña Cebollera]] (2,129&nbsp;m) at the northernmost end of the province, a [[tripoint]] between the Madrid region and the provinces of Segovia and Guadalajara.

;Fauna
Among the protected species of birds nesting in the region stand out the [[Spanish imperial eagle]], the [[golden eagle]], the [[Bonelli's eagle]], the [[cinereous vulture]], the [[peregrine falcon]] and the [[black stork]].{{Sfn|Lara Zabía|Montoro Louvier|Mingot Martín|2011|p=362}}

Exotic invasive species of birds and mammals in the region include the [[Trachemys scripta elegans|red-eared slider]], the [[Myiopsitta monachus|monk parakeet]], the [[Chelydra serpentina|common snapping turtle]], the [[Psittacula krameri|rose-ringed parakeet]], the [[Neovison vison|American mink]] and the [[Procyon lotor|raccoon]].{{Sfn|Cobos Suárez|Martín Sanz|2011|pp=88–90}} Species described as "out of place" and with an increasing population include the [[Larus ridibundus|black-headed gull]], the [[Larus fuscus|lesser black-backed gull]], the [[Phalacrocorax carbo|great cormorant]] and [[Streptopelia decaocto|Eurasian collared dove]],{{Sfn|Cobos Suárez|Martín Sanz|2011|pp=90–91}} while the emblematic [[iberian ibex]] is presented as a case of a species "gone out of control" in [[La Pedriza]] following its [[re-introduction]] in the region in 1990 after roughly a century disappeared from the Madrilenian mountains.{{Sfn|Cobos Suárez|Martín Sanz|2011|p=92}}
[[File:Summer is coming - Se acerca el Verano (Salamandra salamandra under assault) (7655566054).jpg|thumb|left|A [[fire salamander]] in the {{ill|laguna de los Pájaros|es}}]]
The mountain amphibians living at a high altitude include the [[Salamandra salamandra|fire salamander]], the [[Triturus marmoratus|marbled newt]], the [[mesotriton alpestris|alpine newt]], the [[Rana iberica|iberian frog]], the [[Hyla arborea|European tree frog]] or the [[Alytes obstetricans|common midwife toad]].{{Sfn|Ayllón López|Barbera Luna|2011|p=59}} At a middle elevation in the mountain reaches close to water streams there are species such as the [[Lissotriton boscai|Bosca's newt]], the [[Triturus pygmaeus|southern marbled newt]], the [[Hyla meridionalis|mediterranean tree frog]] or the [[Alytes cisternasii|iberian midwife toad]].{{Sfn|Ayllón López|Barbera Luna|2011|p=60}} The [[Pelodytes punctatus|common parsley frog]] and the ''Alytes obstetricans pertinax'' dwell in the limestone lowlands near the Tagus in the south-east of the region.{{Sfn|Ayllón López|Barbera Luna|2011|p=60}} Among the all-around amphibians adaptable to different heights stand out the [[Bufo calamita|natterjack toad]], the [[Bufo bufo|common toad]] and the [[Pelophylax perezi|iberian green frog]].{{Sfn|Ayllón López|Barbera Luna|2011|p=60}} Other species with a wide distribution range (although in this case restricted by altitude) are the [[Pleurodeles waltl|gallipato]], the [[Pelobates cultripes|iberian spadefoot toad]], the [[Discoglossus galganoi|iberian painted frog]], and the [[Discoglossus jeanneae|Spanish painted frog]].{{Sfn|Ayllón López|Barbera Luna|2011|p=60}}
[[File:Psammodromus algirus 2601.jpg|thumb|right|An [[Psammodromus algirus|Algerian sand racer]] in [[Manzanares el Real]]]]
Regarding the reptiles, species such as the [[Iberolacerta cyreni|Cyren's rock lizard]], the [[Podarcis muralis|European wall lizard]], the [[Lacerta schreiberi|iberian emerald lizard]], the [[Anguis fragilis|deaf adder]] or snakes such as the [[Coronella austriaca|smooth snake]] or the ''[[Vipera latastei]]'' dwell in the mountain heights.{{Sfn|Ayllón López|Barbera Luna|2011|p=62–63}} At the lower reaches of the mountains the [[Emys orbicularis|European pond turtle]] and the [[Chalcides bedriagai|Brediaga's skink]] can be found, while the [[western false smooth snake]] is restricted to areas in the south of the region.{{Sfn|Ayllón López|Barbera Luna|2011|p=63}} Among the species of all-around reptiles, adaptable to different biomes stand out the [[Mauremys leprosa|Spanish pond turtle]], the [[Tarentola mauritanica|salamanquesa]], the [[western three-toed skink]], the [[Acanthodactylus erythrurus|spiny-footed lizard]], the [[Timon lepidus|ocellated lizard]], the [[Psammodromus algirus|Algerian sand racer]], [[Psammodromus hispanicus|Spanish psammodromus]], the ubiquitous [[Podarcis hispanica|iberian wall lizard]], the [[Blanus cinereus|iberian worm lizard]], the ''[[Coronella girondica]]'', the [[Malpolon monspessulanus|Montpellier snake]]; [[Natrix natrix|grass snake]] and the [[Natrix maura|viperine snake]].{{Sfn|Ayllón López|Barbera Luna|2011|pp=63–64}}

The fish species are affected by the high number of reservoirs in the region.{{Sfn|Gallego Calvo|2011|p=414}} Among the threatened species in the rivers stand out the [[Anguilla anguilla|European eel]], the [[iberian barbel]], the ''[[Squalius alburnoides]]'', the ''[[Cobitis calderoni]]'' and, potentially, the ''[[Chondrostoma lemmingii]]''.{{Sfn|Gallego Calvo|2011|p=418}} Conversely the set of invasive species of fish includes [[Esox lucius|pike]], [[Ictalurus melas|black bullhead catfish]], [[Lepomis gibbosus|pumpkinseed]], [[Stizostedion lucioperca|zander]], [[Alburnus alburnus|common bleak]] and [[Micropterus salmoides|black-bass]].{{Sfn|Gallego Calvo|2011|p=418}}

;Vegetation
[[File:Hayedo de Montejo y su especial Microclima.jpg|thumb|right|The summer drought is characteristic of the Madrid region's climate. {{ill|Montejo Beech|es|Hayedo de Montejo}} (part of the transnational [[Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe]] world heritage site) is a relict forest featuring a particular case of microclimate, allowing for Eurosiberian species that do not grow in the region in normal conditions.]]
In the vicinity of the mountain peaks, oromediterranean vegetation such as ''[[Agrostis truncatula]]'', ''{{ill|Armeria caespitosa|es}}'', ''[[Festuca indigesta]]'', ''{{ill|Jasione crispa|es}}'', ''{{ill|Jurinea humilis|es}}'', ''[[Minuartia recurva]]'', ''[[Pilosella vahlii]]'', ''[[Plantago holosteum]]'' and the ''[[Thymus praecox]]'' is common.{{Sfn|Grijalbo Cervantes|2011|p=31}} Below the summit line, shrubby species such as the [[Cytisus oromediterraneus]] and the [[Juniperus communis|common juniper]] as well as the [[Pinus sylvestris|Scots pine]] take over.{{Sfn|Grijalbo Cervantes|2011|p=32}} There are also masses of [[Pinus nigra|black pine]] and the [[Quercus pyrenaica|pyrenean oak]] situated above the domain of the holm oak.{{Sfn|Grijalbo Cervantes|2011|p=34}}
[[File:Arganda_del_Rey_(39301482444).jpg|thumb|left|Olive tree orchards in [[Arganda del Rey]]]]
Eurosiberian flora is not common in the region, and species such as the [[Betula alba|moor birch]] and the [[Betula pendula|silver birch]] are restricted to very specific humid valley areas with special climate conditions.{{Sfn|Grijalbo Cervantes|2011|p=35}}
The climax vegetation in the ''campiña'' is the [[Quercus ilex|holly oak]]. Some of the species that take over when the holly oak forest degrades are the [[Cistus ladanifer|"sticky shrub"]], the [[Retama sphaerocarpa]], the [[Lavandula pedunculata|French lavender]], the ''[[Thymus mastichina]]'' and the ''[[Thymus zygis]]''.{{Sfn|Grijalbo Cervantes|2011|p=39}}

The lower reaches of Guadarrama Mountain Range are populated by species such as the ''[[Juniperus thurifera]]'', the [[Pinus pinaster|maritime pine]], the [[Quercus faginea|Portuguese oak]], the [[Pinus pinea|stone pine]]; only in the somewhat more humid westernmost end of the region, near the {{ill|Alto del Mirlo|es}}, there are forests of [[Castanea sativa|chestnut tree]].{{Sfn|Grijalbo Cervantes|2011|pp=36–38}}

54,4% of the surface of the region is soil categorised as forest areas of which the 51.4% (27.7% of the total of the region) it is already covered by forests, so there is room for tree re-population.{{Sfn|Sanjuanbenito García|2011|p=163}} The first modest efforts towards tree re-population were taken in the Lozoya Valley in the late 19th century intending to achieve a purer water from the river,{{Sfn|Sanjuanbenito García|2011|p=161}} that provided the capital with water for consumption. However, the bulk of the process took place after the Spanish Civil War, with a largely successful repopulation with several species of [[conifers]].{{Sfn|Sanjuanbenito García|2011|p=162}}

== Climate ==
The Madrid region features a climate marked by dry summers, while average temperature varies with altitude, marking different climate subtypes. Most of the region (including the capital) has a climate intermediate between a [[hot-summer mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csa'') and a [[Semi-arid climate#Cold semi-arid climates|cold semi-arid climate]] (Köppen ''BSk''), with a dry summer and a moderate to low amount of rain primarily distributed throughout the rest of the year (in the case of the capital, roughly an equinoctial pattern of precipitation maximums), as well as summer temperature averages over 22&nbsp;°C (with daily maximums consistently surpassing 30&nbsp;°C in July and August). The areas at a higher altitude close to the [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] feature a colder climate, also generally with more precipitation (particularly in the winter), with climate subtypes ranging from the ''Csa'' to the warm-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen: ''Csb'') and the [[Continental climate|dry summer continental climate]] (Köppen: ''Dsb'') on the peaks of the mountain range, with temperature averages below freezing point during January and February in the later case.

==History==

===Prehistory ===
[[File:Campaniforme Ciempozuelos (M.A.N. Inv.32252) 01.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Prehistoric vessel from [[Ciempozuelos]], exhibited at the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain|National Archaeological Museum of Spain in Madrid]]]]
The territory of the Community of Madrid has been populated since the [[Lower Paleolithic]], mainly in the valleys between the rivers of [[Manzanares (river)|Manzanares]], [[Jarama]], and [[Henares]], where several archaeological findings have been made.

Some notable discoveries of the region the bell-shaped vase of Ciempozuelos (between 1970 and 1470 BCE),<ref>[http://www.ayto-ciempozuelos.org/historia/edad_media1.html La Prehistoria en Ciempozuelos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511184355/http://www.ayto-ciempozuelos.org/historia/edad_media1.html |date=2006-05-11 }}</ref> from the [[Bell beaker culture]].

=== Romans and Visigoths ===
[[File:ComplutumEstaciones.jpg|thumb|upright|A mosaic of the House of Dionysus in [[Complutum]]]]
During the [[Roman Empire]], the region was part of the [[Citerior Tarraconese]] province, except for the south-west portion of it, which belonged to [[Lusitania]]. It was crossed by two important Roman roads, the ''via xxiv-xxix'' (joining [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]] to [[Laminium]] and ''via xxv'' (which joined [[Emerita Augusta]] and [[Caesaraugusta]]), and contained some important conurbations. The city of [[Complutum]] (today [[Alcalá de Henares]]) became an important metropolis, whereas [[Titulcia]] and [[Miaccum]] were important crossroad communities.

During the period of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]], the region lost its importance. The population was scattered amongst several small towns. Complutum was designated the bishopric seat in the 5th century by orders of Asturio, archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toledo|Toledo]], but this event was not enough to bring back the lost splendor of the city.

===Al-Andalus===
The centre of the peninsula (the Middle Mark of [[Al-Andalus]] or ''aṯ-Ṯaḡr al-Awsaṭ'') became a strategic military post in the 11th century. The Muslim rulers created a defensive system of fortresses and towers all across the region with which they tried to stop the advance of the Christian kingdoms of the north.

The fortress of ''Mayrit'' (Madrid) was built somewhere between 860 and 880 AD, as a walled precinct where a military and religious community lived, and which constituted the foundation of the city. It soon became the most strategic fortress in defense of the city of Toledo above the fortresses of [[Talamanca de Jarama|Talamanca]] and Qal'-at'-Abd-Al-Salam (Alcalá de Henares). In 1083 (or 1085) [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile|Alfonso VI]] took the city of Madrid in the context of his wider campaign to conquer Toledo.{{Sfn|Montoliú Camps|1996|p=56}} Alcalá de Henares fell in 1118 in a new period of Castilian annexation.

[[File:Muralla y barbacana de Buitrago del Lozoya.jpg|thumb|right|City walls of [[Buitrago del Lozoya]]]]

===Christian repopulation===
The recently conquered lands by the Christian kingdoms were desegregated into several constituencies, as a consequence of a long process of repopulation that took place over the course of four centuries. The feudal and ecclesiastical lords came into constant conflict with the different councils that had been granted the authority to repopulate.

[[File:España - Manzanares El Real - Castillo de Manzanares el Real 003.JPG|thumb|left|250px|[[New Castle of Manzanares el Real|Castle of Manzanares el Real]]]]
In the 13th century, Madrid was the only town of the current-day region that preserved its own juridical personality,{{citation needed|date=December 2020}} at first with the Old ''[[Fuero]]'' (Charter) and later with the Royal ''Fuero'', granted by [[Alfonso X of Castile]] in 1262 and ratified by [[Alfonso XI of Castile|Alfonso XI]] in 1339. On the other hand, the town of [[Buitrago del Lozoya]], Alcalá de Henares and [[Talamanca de Jarama]], which were rapidly repopulated until that century, were under the dominion of the feudal or ecclesiastical lords. Specifically, Alcalá de Henares was under the hands of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toledo|archbishopric of Toledo]] and remained so until the 19th century.

Around the town of Madrid, an administrative territory was created known as ''Tierra de Madrid'' (Land of Madrid), the origin of the province that included the areas of the current municipalities of San Sebastián de los Reyes, Cobeña, Las Rozas de Madrid, Rivas-Vaciamadrid, Torrejón de Velasco, Alcorcón, San Fernando de Henares, and Griñón.

Madrid was in constant strife with the powerful council of [[Segovia]], whose jurisdiction extended south of the [[Guadarrama Mountains]]; they both fought for the control of the Real de Manzanares, a large [[Comarcas of Spain|comarca]] (shire) that was finally given to the [[House of Mendoza]].

Castilian monarchs showed a predilection for the center of the peninsula, with abundant forests and game. ''El Pardo'' was a region visited frequently by kings since the time of [[Henry III of Castile|Henry III]], in the 14th century. The [[Catholic Monarchs]] started the construction of the [[Royal Palace of Aranjuez]].{{dubious|date=January 2019}}<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brebbia|first=C.

===Early modern period===
[[File:Dibujo madrid 1562.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Panoramic view of Madrid, a 16th-century work by [[Anton van den Wyngaerde]]]]
The town of Madrid, which was one of the eighteen cities with the right to vote in the [[Cortes of Castile]], was seat of the Courts themselves on several occasions and was the residence of several monarchs, amongst them the emperor [[Charles I of Spain|Charles I]] who reformed and expanded the ''Alcázar'' or Castle of the city. Alcalá de Henares grew in importance as cultural center since the foundation by the [[Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros|Cardinal Cisneros]] of [[University of Alcalá de Henares|its university]].

In 1561, King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] made Madrid the capital of the [[Spanish empire|Hispanic Monarchy]]. The surrounding territories became economically subordinated to the town itself, even beyond the present day limits of the Community of Madrid. But it was not a unified region as several lords and churches had jurisdiction over their own autonomous territories.

During the 18th century, the fragmented administration of the region was not solved despite several attempts. During the reign of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], the ''intendencia'' was created as a political and administrative division. Nonetheless, the ''intendencia'' of Madrid did not fully solve the problem, and the region was still fragmented into several small dominions even though some processes were centralized. This territorial dispersion had a negative effect on its economic growth; while the town of Madrid received economic resources from the entire country as the capital, the surrounding territories—in hands of noblemen or the clergy—became impoverished.

During the eighteenth century, the town of Madrid was transformed through several grandiose buildings and monuments as well as through the creation of many social, economic, and cultural institutions, some of which are still operating. Madrid grew to a population of 156,672 inhabitants by the end of the eighteenth century.

=== Province ===
[[File:Fabricación de tinajones en Colmenar de Oreja (Ulpiano Checa.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.85|Manufacturing of big clay pots in [[Colmenar de Oreja]] (by [[Ulpiano Checa]])]]
The current territory of the region was roughly defined with the [[1833 territorial division of Spain|1833 reorganization of Spain into provinces]] promoted by [[Javier de Burgos]], in which the province of Madrid was classified in the region of [[New Castile (Spain)|New Castile]] (lacking the later any sort of administrative institution at the regional level nonetheless). The government institution at the provincial level was the [[Provincial deputation (Spain)|deputation]] (''diputación''). In addition to the former body, another provincial political authority was the [[civil governor]] discretionarily designated by the central government. Two modest changes to the 1833 provincial boundaries that concerned Madrid took place shortly before 1845, when Aranjuez (187&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>)  left the [[province of Toledo]] and joined that of Marid, and in 1850, when the small municipality of [[Valdeavero]] (19&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), until then part of the [[province of Guadalajara]], joined the province of Madrid.{{Sfn|Burgueño|1990|pp=403; 406}}

One of the limits so far for the growth of the capital, water supply, experienced a substantial change in 1858 following the arrival to the city of Madrid of water from the [[Lozoya River]] with the inauguration of the bringing of the [[Canal de Isabel II]].{{Sfn|Bahamonde Magro|Fernández García|2008|p=489}}

In decadence since the middle 18th century, the city of [[Alcalá de Henares]], experienced a relative demographic and economic upturn in the second half of the 19th century, based on its newly acquired condition of military outpost, to which an embryonic industrial nucleus was also added.{{Sfn|Gómez Mendoza|2008|pp=625-628}}

During the reign of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] the south of the province was made up of small agricultural settlements of limited population. Among them, Getafe stood out in population,{{Sfn|García Alcalá|2008|p=650}} and became the seat of a [[Judicial districts of Spain|judicial district]] in 1834,{{Sfn|García Alcalá|2008|p=652}} with the main economic activity of the former jurisdiction still being non-irrigated agriculture.{{Sfn|García Alcalá|2008|p=652}} [[Rail transport]] arrived in 1851, with the [[Strawberry train]], the railway connecting Madrid and [[Aranjuez]].
[[File:Edificio de la Diputación Provincial de Madrid 1939.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Ruins of the headquarters of the provincial deputation in 1939]]

During the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939), the territory was divided by the battlefront, with the southwest of the province controlled by the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|rebel faction]], and the capital as well as a great part of the rest of the province by the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|side loyal to the Republic]]. The city of Madrid was target of many bombings during the conflict, becoming the first big city in Europe to suffer such systematic and massive air attacks.{{Sfn|Sánchez Pérez|2008|p=555}}

Since the 1970s, a process of a population transfer from the capital to the rest of municipalities of the metropolitan area emerged. This process accelerated when the autonomous community was founded, and it took placed along a strong decrease of birth rates.{{Sfn|Fernández García|2008|p=733}}

=== Autonomous community ===
The creation of the contemporary Community of Madrid was preceded by an intense political debate. Autonomous communities were to be created by one or more provinces with a distinct regional identity. Since the 1833 provincial organization, Madrid was part of the [[historical region]] of [[New Castile (Spain)|New Castile]] along with the provinces of Guadalajara, Toledo, Cuenca and Ciudad Real. Thus, it was first planned that the province of Madrid would be part of the future community of Castile–La Mancha (which was roughly similar to New Castile, with the addition of [[Province of Albacete|Albacete]]) but with some special considerations as the home of the national capital.<ref name=sinopsis>Sid, Blanca. [http://narros.congreso.es/constitucion/estatutos/sinopsis.jsp?com=74 Sinópsis del estatuto de Autonomía de la Comunidad de Madrid] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211230846/http://narros.congreso.es/constitucion/estatutos/sinopsis.jsp?com=74 |date=2009-12-11 }}. Gestión Parlamentaria de la Asamblea de la Comunidad de Madrid. Accessed on: 2008-04-08</ref> The other provinces that were to become part of the autonomous community of [[Castile–La Mancha]] expressed fears of inequality if Madrid were associated with them. These provinces opposed such a special status, and after considering other options for Madrid—like its inclusion in the community of Castile and León or its constitution as an entity similar to a [[federal district]].<ref name=sinopsis/>—it was decided that the province of Madrid would become a single-province autonomous community by virtue of Article 144 of the Constitution, which empowers the Cortes to create an autonomous community in the "nation's interest" even if it did not satisfy the requirement of having a distinct historical identity. Thus, in 1983, the Community of Madrid was constituted and a [[Statute of Autonomy]] was approved taking over all the competences of the old "''Diputación Provincial''" and the new ones the Statute considered.

During the first 25 years of the "autonomic" period, this autonomous community accounted for the biggest [[economic growth]] in Spain, becoming a platform for the internationalisation of the [[Spanish economy]],{{sfn|García Delgado|Carrera Troyano|2008|p=753}} featuring a marked preponderance of the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service sector]].{{sfn|García Delgado|Carrera Troyano|2008|pp=756-757}} By the turn of the 21st century, a strong boost to the [[Construction|construction sub-sector]] also took place.{{sfn|García Delgado|Carrera Troyano|2008|pp=757-758}} During this period the Community of Madrid stood out due to its role as centre for welcoming immigration,{{sfn|García Delgado|Carrera Troyano|2008|pp=761}} due to its condition as transport node vis-à-vis the Spanish geography,{{sfn|García Delgado|Carrera Troyano|2008|pp=762}} and due to its condition as scientific and cultural centre of the country.{{sfn|García Delgado|Carrera Troyano|2008|pp=763-764}}

[[File:Consejo de gobierno de Ángel Garrido.jpg|thumb|right|A meeting of the [[Government of the Community of Madrid|Council of Government]] presided by former President [[Ángel Garrido]]]]
Like the rest of autonomous communities, the Community of Madrid is organized politically within a [[parliamentary system]]; that is, the [[head of government]]—known as the "president"—is dependent on the direct support from the autonomous [[legislative power|legislature]], whose members elect him by a [[majority]].

The [[Statute of Autonomy]] of the Madrid Autonomous Community is the fundamental organic law in conjunction with (and subordinated to) the [[Spanish constitution]]. The Statute of Autonomy establishes that the powers through which the self-government of the autonomous community is exercised are the following institutions:

* The [[Assembly of Madrid]],<ref>[http://www.asambleamadrid.es/AsambleaDeMadrid/ES/QueEsLaAsamblea/Historia/DatosHistoricos/default.htm Origen y evolución de la Asamblea de Madrid] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412020213/http://www.asambleamadrid.es/AsambleaDeMadrid/ES/QueEsLaAsamblea/Historia/DatosHistoricos/default.htm |date=2008-04-12 }}</ref> a directly elected body, represents the people of Madrid and exercises the [[legislative power]] of the community in approving and supervising the budget and in coordinating and controlling the actions of the government. The seat of the Assembly is located in Madrid, in the district of [[Puente de Vallecas]]. The members of the legislature (currently 132) are elected through [[proportional representation]] with closed-party lists and a 5% [[electoral threshold]] in a single region-wide constituency.{{refn|group=n.|The elections have normally followed the default electoral calendar set for most autonomous communities (with the exception of [[Catalonia]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and [[Andalusia]]). The only exception to this occurred in 2003, in which due to the refusal of two socialist deputies to follow party discipline after the May election prevented the formation of any government.<ref>[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2003/06/28/madrid/1056825603.html El 'caso Tamayo y Sáez']</ref> Therefore, new elections were held in October, outside the established electoral calendar.}} The [[2019 Madrilenian regional election|last election]] took place on 26 May 2019.
* The [[President of the Community of Madrid]] is the supreme representative of the autonomous community and the ordinary representation of the State. It presides and heads the activities of the Madrilenian autonomous government, designates and dismisses the vice-presidents and the ministers (''consejeros'') which conform an executive cabinet. The investiture of the regional president, who is nominated as candidate by the [[List of Presidents of the Madrid Assembly|Speaker of the Assembly]] among its members after holding consultations, is voted by a qualified majority of the plenary of the legislature (or, failing to achieve the former, a simple majority of 'yes' votes in a second round voting 48 hours later) and then formally appointed by the King through a [[Royal Decree]]. The seat of the Presidency is the [[Royal House of the Post Office|Real Casa de Correos]] located at the [[Puerta del Sol]] at the center of Madrid.<ref>[http://www.madridhistorico.com/seccion7_enciclopedia/index_enciclopedia.php?id=R&idinformacion=217&pag=1#inicio2 La Real Casa de Correos, sede de la Presidencia de la Comunidad de Madrid]</ref> Since 2019, the president is [[Isabel Díaz Ayuso]], of the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP).
* The [[Government of the Community of Madrid]] is the collegiate body that heads the politics and the [[executive power|executive and administrative powers]] of the community. The incumbent Council of Government comprises the President, the vice-president (assuming additional competences) and twelve more ministers.

=== Delegation of the Central Government ===
Since the creation of autonomous communities, the [[Government of Spain]] appoints a special representative to each autonomous community, the [[Government Delegation (Spain)|Government Delegate]], part of the Peripheral State Administration. Unlike other single-province autonomous communities, the Government also appoints the Government Sub-delegate, the successor office to the provincial civil governor. The seats of both the delegation and the subdelegation are located at the {{interlanguage link|Borghetto Palace|es|Palacio de Borghetto}} in Madrid.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.abc.es/20120911/local-madrid/abci-palacio-borghetto-casa-poder-201209102212.html|journal=[[ABC (Spain)|ABC]]|title=Palacio de Borghetto, la casa del poder|date=11 September 2012|first=Sara|last=Medialdea}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seat.mpr.gob.es/portal/delegaciones_gobierno/delegaciones/madrid.html|title=Delegación del Gobierno en la Comunidad de Madrid|publisher=Ministerio de Política Territorial y Función Pública|access-date=10 January 2019|archive-date=10 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110235058/http://www.seat.mpr.gob.es/portal/delegaciones_gobierno/delegaciones/madrid.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Administrative divisions ===
[[File:Madrid - Mapa municipal.svg|right|245px|Municipal Map of the Community of Madrid.]]
{{Main|List of municipalities in the Community of Madrid}}
The Community of Madrid, following the long-standing form of [[local government in Spain]], is divided administratively into 179 [[Municipalities of Spain|municipalities]] (featuring 801 towns and entities). Its municipalities comprise 2.2% of the Spanish territory (8,110). It is ranked 23rd amongst Spanish provinces in number of municipalities, which is slightly above average.{{refn|group=n.|In Madrid, the average area of a municipality is {{cvt|44.8|km2}}, slightly larger than the national average. Madrid is by far the largest. Between 1948 and 1954, the city annexed the neighboring municipalities of Chamartín de la Rosa, Fuencarral, Barajas, El Pardo, Hortaleza, Canillas, Canillejas, Vicálvaro, Vallecas, Villaverde, Carabanchel Alto, Carabanchel Baja and Aravaca.

The five largest municipalities by area are: Madrid {{cvt|605.8|km2}}; Aranjuez {{cvt|189.1|km2}}; Colmenar Viejo {{cvt|182.6|km2}}; Rascafría {{cvt|150.3|km2}}; and Manzanares el Real {{cvt|128.4|km2}}.

The smallest municipalities by area are: Casarrubuelos {{cvt|5.3|km2}}; La Serna del Monte {{cvt|5.4|km2}}; Pelayos de la Presa {{cvt|7.6|km2}}; Madarcos {{cvt|8.5|km2}}; and Torrejón de la Calzada {{cvt|9.0|km2}}.}}
The average is 165 municipalities by province. The ''[[ayuntamiento (Spain)|ayuntamiento]]'', presided by its ''alcalde'' (Mayor) is the formal institution charged with the government and administration of most municipalities. The municipal councillors forming the deliberative assembly of the ''ayuntamiento'' are directly elected through [[proportional representation]] with closed party lists and a 5% [[electoral threshold]]. In turn, the councillors are charged with electing from among themselves (by default candidates are the head of each electoral list) the Mayor presiding over the ''ayuntamiento''.

There are twenty [[Judicial districts of Spain|judicial districts]] (''partidos judiciales''), whose seats correspond to the municipalities of  [[Alcalá de Henares]], [[Alcobendas]], [[Alcorcón]], [[Aranjuez]], [[Arganda del Rey]], [[Collado Villalba]], [[Colmenar Viejo]], [[Coslada]], [[Fuenlabrada]], [[Getafe]], [[Leganés]], [[Madrid]], [[Majadahonda]], [[Móstoles]], [[Navalcarnero]], [[Parla]], [[San Lorenzo de El Escorial]], [[Torrejón de Ardoz]], [[Torrelaguna]], [[Valdemoro]], and [[Valdaracete]] (the historical judicial district of San Martín de Valdeiglesias is no longer a judicial district as of 1985). These jurisdictions relate to the judicial administration, with their seat having at least one [[Judiciary of Spain#Courts of first instance|court of first instance]].

In 2005, the Community of Madrid was the main receptor of [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] in the country, at 34.3% of the total. The community ranks 34th amongst all European regions (evaluated in 2002), and 50th amongst the most competitive cities-regions worldwide,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lavanguardia.es/lv24h/20061207/51295486195.html |title=Madrid, en el puesto 50º en el ranking de las ciudades-región más competitivas del planeta |access-date=2008-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222548/http://www.lavanguardia.es/lv24h/20061207/51295486195.html |archive-date=2007-09-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ahead of [[Barcelona]] and [[Valencia]], the other two largest [[metropolitan areas]] of Spain. The strengths of the economy of the community are its low unemployment rate, its high investment in research, its high development, and the added-value services therein performed. Its weaknesses include the low penetration of broadband and new technologies of information and an unequal male to female occupation.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070609122439/http://www.cor.europa.eu/document/press/newsletter_es_55.pdf Informe ''Plataforma de seguimiento de la Estrategia de Lisboa'': puntos fuertes y débiles de la economía madrileña]</ref>
[[File:MADRID 060126 MXALX 067.jpg|thumb|Madrid Trade Fair]]
The service, construction, and industry sectors are prominent in Madrid's commercial productive structure. According to the ''Directorio Central de Empresas'' (Central Companies Directory of the INE), Madrid's active businesses stand in third place nationally in terms of numbers as at 1 January 2006. The branches of activity with most active businesses are other business activities, retail trade, construction, wholesale trade, hospitality, property activities, land transport, and pipeline transport.

Madrid's levels of industrial activity set it at fourth place in Spain. The following areas predominate in terms of business numbers: publishing and graphic arts, manufacture of metal products (except machinery and equipment), manufacture of furniture and other manufacturing industries, wearing apparel and fur industry, and food product industry. The province also boasts a higher concentration of high and medium technology activities and services than the rest of Spain. This is the case in the following areas: manufacture of office machinery and IT equipment; manufacture of electronic products, manufacture of radio equipment, and devices; manufacture of medical and surgical, precision, optical and timekeeping equipment and instruments; post and telecommunications; IT activities; and research and development.<ref>http://www.ine.es/jaxi/changeLanguage.do?target=menu&download=0&multi=0&type=pcaxis&file=inebase&print=1&page=menu&path=/t37/p201&language=1 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604003659/http://www.ine.es/jaxi/changeLanguage.do?target=menu&download=0&multi=0&type=pcaxis&file=inebase&print=1&page=menu&path=%2Ft37%2Fp201&language=1 |date=2008-06-04 }} Central Companies Directory (CCD) of the Spanish INE</ref>

The Community of Madrid is the third most populous region in Spain, after [[Andalusia]] and [[Catalonia]], and the most populous province, with 6,661,949 inhabitants. [[Population density]] is 829.62 hab/km<sup>2</sup>, much higher than the national average of 93.8 hab/km<sup>2</sup>. Population density varies with the community itself; the [[Madrid|municipality of Madrid]] has a density of 5,300 hab/km<sup>2</sup>, whereas the Sierra Norte has a population density of less than 10 hab/km<sup>2</sup>. The vast majority of the population lives in the capital and its metropolitan area, which is the most populated in Spain.

Madrid also has the greatest population density in Spain. Its inhabitants are mainly concentrated in the capital (which is the Spanish city with the highest resident population) and in a series of municipalities ([[Móstoles]], [[Alcalá de Henares]], [[Fuenlabrada]], [[Leganés]], [[Alcorcón]], [[Getafe]], [[Torrejón de Ardoz]], and [[Alcobendas]]), as opposed to in rural areas with low population density. Its citizens have diverse origins, and Madrid is the province with the highest number of residents born outside its territory and with the largest foreign population (13.32%).{{dubious|date=August 2019}} It is a focus of attraction for those migrating for reasons of employment.

==Education==
{{main|Education in Spain}}
State Education in Spain is free and compulsory from six to sixteen years of age. The current education system is called LOMLOE (Ley Orgánica 3/2020, de 29 de diciembre, por la que se modifica la Ley Orgánica 2/2006, de 3 de mayo, de Educación).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2020-17264|title = BOE.es - BOE-A-2020-17264 Ley Orgánica 3/2020, de 29 de diciembre, por la que se modifica la Ley Orgánica 2/2006, de 3 de mayo, de Educación}}</ref>

===Levels===
[[File:IES Palas Atenea 1.JPG|thumb|right|Secondary school in [[Torrejón de Ardoz]]]]
*From three to six years – Educación Infantil (Preparatory School)
*From six to twelve years – Educación Primaria (Primary School), years first through sixth
*From twelve to sixteen years – Educación Secundaria Obligatoria (Compulsory Secondary School), years first through fourth
*From sixteen to seventeen years – Bachillerato (Post-Compulsory School), years first and second

Children from three to five years old in Spain have the option of attending the [[pre-school]] stage, which is non-compulsory and free for all students. It is regarded as an integral part of the education system with infantil classes in almost every primary school. There are some separate Colegios Infantiles or nursery schools.

Spanish students aged six to sixteen undergo [[primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]] education, which are compulsory and free of charge. Successful students are awarded a Secondary Education Certificate, which is necessary for entering further (optional) education as is Bachillerato for their University or Formación Profesional (vocational studies).
Once students have finished their Bachillerato, they can take their University Entrance Exam (Pruebas de Acceso a la Universidad, popularly called ''Selectividad'') which differs greatly from region to region.

The secondary stage of education is normally referred to by its initials, e. g., ESO or Educación Secundaria Obligatoria for secondary education.

===Universities===
Madrid is home to a large number of public and private universities.

[[File:Facultad de Medicina, Complutense University of Madrid, 2016, 06.jpg|thumb|right|Faculty of Medicine of the Complutense University of Madrid, in the [[University City of Madrid|Ciudad Universitaria campus]]]]
The [[Complutense University of Madrid]] is one of the most prestigious, and the largest, university in Spain and one of the oldest universities in the world. It has 10,000 staff members and a student population of 117,000. Nearly all academic staff are Spanish. It is located on two campuses, in the university quarter Ciudad Universitaria at Moncloa in Madrid, and in Somosaguas.<ref name="Universidad Complutense">{{cite news

}}</ref> The Complutense University of Madrid was founded in [[Alcalá de Henares]], old Complutum, by [[Cardinal Cisneros]] in 1499. Nevertherless, its real origin dates back from 1293, when King Sancho IV of Castile built the General Schools of Alcalá, which would give rise to Cisnero's Complutense University. During the course of 1509-1510 five schools were already operative: Artes y Filosofía (Arts & Philosophy), Teología (Theology), Derecho Canónico (Canonical Laws), Letras (Liberal Arts) and Medicina (Medicine). In 1836, during the reign of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabel II]], the university was moved to Madrid, where it took the name of Central University and was located at San Bernardo Street. Subsequently, in 1927, a new [[University City of Madrid|University City]] ("Ciudad Universitaria") was planned to be built in the district of Moncloa-Aravaca. The [[Spanish Civil War]] turned the University City into a war zone, with several faculties sustaining severe damage during the conflict. By 1943 the Central University started to be known as the University of Madrid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://censoarchivos.mcu.es/CensoGuia/fondoDetail.htm?id=1185100|title=Área de Contexto|publisher=[[Ministry of Culture and Sport (Spain)|Ministerio de Cultura y Deporte]]|work=Censo guía de archivos de España e Iberoamérica}}</ref>

In 1970 the University of Madrid was renamed to Complutense University of Madrid. It was then when the new campus at Somosaguas was created in order to house the new School of Social Sciences. The old Alcalá campus was reopened as the independent [[University of Alcalá]] in 1977.<ref name="Universidad Complutense de Madrid">{{cite news

Another important university is the [[Autonomous University of Madrid|Autonoma]], perhaps Spain's best university for research along with the Complutense, was instituted under the leadership of the famous physicist, [[Nicolás Cabrera (physicist)|Nicolás Cabrera]]. The Autonoma is widely recognised for its research strengths in theoretical physics. Known simply as ''la Autónoma'' in Madrid, its main site is the Cantoblanco Campus, situated 15 kilometers to the north of the capital (M-607) and close to the municipal areas of Madrid, namely [[Alcobendas]], [[San Sebastián de los Reyes]], [[Tres Cantos]] and [[Colmenar Viejo]].
Located on the main site are the Rectorate building and the Faculties of Science, Philosophy and Fine Arts, Law, Economic Science and Business Studies, Psychology, Higher School of Computing Science and Engineering, and the Faculty of Teacher Training and Education. The Medical School is located outside the main site and beside the Hospital Universitario La Paz.<ref name="Universidad Autónoma">{{cite news

==Transportation==

===Air===
{{main|Barajas International Airport}}
[[File:Terminal T-4 Madrid - Barajas Airport (8520153689)b.jpg|thumb|Barajas Airport]]
Madrid is served by [[Barajas International Airport]]. Barajas is the main [[Airline hub|hub]] of [[Iberia Airlines]] and consequently serves as the main gateway to the Iberian peninsula from Europe, the Americas, and the rest of the world. Current passenger volumes range upwards of 52 million passengers per year, putting it in the [[World's busiest airport|top 10]] busiest airports in the world.<ref>http://www.airports.org/aci/aci/file/Press%20Releases/2007_PRs/PR060307_PrelimResults2006.pdf Preliminary Air Traffic Results for 2006 from Airports Council International</ref> Given annual increases close to 10%, a new fourth terminal has been constructed. It has significantly reduced delays and doubled the capacity of the airport to more than 70 million passengers per year. Two additional runways have also been constructed, making Barajas a fully operational four-runway airport.

===Commuter rail===
{{main|Cercanías Madrid}}
[[File:Parla - Estación de tren de cercanías 1.jpg|thumb|right|Commuter rail station in [[Parla]]]]
Cercanías Madrid is the [[commuter rail]] service that serves [[Madrid]], the capital of Spain, and its metropolitan area. It is operated by [[Cercanías]], the commuter rail division of [[Renfe]], the former monopoly of rail services in Spain. The system is infamous for being the target of [[11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings]]. The attacks triggered a small reduction in the ridership of the system, but it is still the most used and most profitable<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.renfe.es/empresa/index.html |title=Renfe Empresa |access-date=2006-02-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103062634/http://www.renfe.es/empresa/index.html |archive-date=2010-01-03 }}</ref> (by 2004) of the commuter rail services in Spain. The total length spans {{cvt|339.1|km}}.

Spain's railway system, the ''Red Nacional de Ferrocarriles Españoles'' ([[Renfe]]), operates the vast majority of Spain's railways. In Madrid, the main rail terminals are [[Madrid Atocha railway station|Atocha]] in the south and [[Chamartín (Madrid)|Chamartín]] in the north.

=== High-speed rail ===

{{Main|AVE}}
The crown jewel of Spain's next decade of infrastructure construction is the Spanish high-speed rail network, Alta Velocidad Española [[AVE]]. Currently, an ambitious plan includes the construction of a {{convert|7,000|km|mi|adj=on}} network, centered on Madrid. The overall goal is to have all important provincial cities be no more than four hours away from Madrid and no more than six hours away from [[Barcelona]]. As of 2008, [[AVE]] [[high-speed trains]] link Madrid-Atocha station to [[Seville]], [[Málaga]], and [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in the south, Valencia, Albacete, Cuenca and Alicante in the east, and to [[Zaragoza]], [[Tarragona]], Girona, Leida, Huesca and [[Barcelona]] in the north-east. [[AVE]] trains also arrive to [[Segovia]], [[Valladolid]], Zamora and León.

Already connected by tunnels used by conventional rail lines, a tunnel link connecting the Atocha and Chamartín stations with high-speed rail services is finished but, as of August 2019, yet to be inaugurated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eleconomista.es/empresas-finanzas/noticias/10023959/08/19/Adif-invertira-1460-millones-en-integrar-Atocha-y-Chamartin-en-una-megaestacion.html|work=El economista|title=Adif invertirá 1.460 millones en integrar Atocha y Chamartín en una megaestación|first=África|last=Semprún|date=2 August 2019}}</ref>

The province of Madrid is also served by an extensive [[commuter rail]] network called [[Cercanías]].

Metro fees are regulated by the [[Consorcio Regional de Transportes de Madrid]] (CRTM) jointly with fees for commuter rail, bus transport and light-rail.

== Culture ==
=== Symbols ===
The flag, coat of arms and hymn of the Community of Madrid were set through the regional Law 2/1983 published in the official regional gazette on 24 December 1983:{{Sfn|Fernández-Xesta y Vázquez|2002–2003|p=371}}
;Flag
{{Main|Flag of the Community of Madrid}}
[[File:(Bandera CAM) Banderas de Madrid y España (4487660760) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Flag of the Community of Madrid waving at the outdoors of a building]]
The flag is described as follows: "''the flag of the Community of Madrid is [[crimson|crimson red]], with seven silver [[five-pointed star]]s, arranged 4 and 3 on the centre of the canvas''".{{Sfn|Fernández-Xesta y Vázquez|2002–2003|p=371}} According to the law, the flag should wave both at the outdoors (occupying a preferential place next to the [[flag of Spain]]) and at the indoors of every public building of the autonomous administration as well as every public building of the municipal administrations located within the territory of the autonomous community.

;Coat of arms
{{Main|Coat of arms of the Community of Madrid}}
The arms are described as follows:
"''The coat of arms of the Community of Madrid features just one partition [[Gules (heraldry)|gules]], and on it, two paired, embattled, turreted, castles [[Or (heraldry)|or]], with port and windows tinctured [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]], masoned [[Sable (heraldry)|sable]], surmounted by seven five-pointed stars [[Argent (heraldry)|argent]] arranged four and three on [[Chief (heraldry)|chief]].''"{{Sfn|Fernández-Xesta y Vázquez|2002–2003|pp=371–373}} The [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] describes the heraldic representation of the [[Regalia of Spain|royal crown of Spain]].

;Hymn
{{Main|Hymn of the Community of Madrid}}
The official anthem was defined along the flag and coat of arms.{{Sfn|Fernández-Xesta y Vázquez|2002–2003|p=371}} However it has very limited institutional use, and thus, it is barely known.

=== Cuisine ===
[[File:Queso de Campo Real tierno.jpg|thumb|right|{{ill|Cheese from Campo Real|es|Queso de Campo Real}}]]
Although the region does not produce enough food to be self-sufficient, the varied territory of the region outside the urbanised centre provides enough food commodities to create its own cuisine: cheese of [[Campo Real]], vine with [[Vinos de Madrid]] [[Denominación de origen|DO]], strawberries and aspargus from Aranjuez, [[Santa Claus melon|melons]] from [[Villaconejos]], [[artichoke]]s from [[Ciempozuelos]], ''[[Phaseolus coccineus|judiones]]'' from [[Montejo de la Sierra]], [[garlic]] from [[Chinchón]], [[chickpea]]s from [[Navalcarnero]], [[lentil]]s from [[Colmenar de Oreja]], cauliflower from [[Griñón]] or a number of vegetables from the [[Alberche River|Alberche Valley]].{{Sfn|Feo Parrondo|2014|pp=34–35}}

In addition, due to the rich restaurant business in the region, "all the regional cuisines of Spain are represented in Madrid" according to {{ill|José del Corral Raya|es}}.{{sfn|Feo Parrondo|2014|p=35}} As the madrilenian cuisine has absorbed much from the rest of regional cuisines of Spain, there is ambiguity when it comes to define the former; however, dishes such as the ''[[cocido madrileño]]'', the ''[[potaje de garbanzos]]'', the ''{{ill|callos a la madrileña|es}}'', the ''[[sopa de ajo]]'' or the ''[[tortilla de patatas]]'' are considered part of the madrilenian cuisine regardless of their geographical specificity.{{Sfn|Feo Parrondo|2014|p=32}} By April 2011 the region had over 40,000 [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s, 2,700 [[Coffeehouse|coffee shops]] and nearly 10,000 [[restaurant]]s.{{Sfn|Feo Parrondo|2014|p=33}}
