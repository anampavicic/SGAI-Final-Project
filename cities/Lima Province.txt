'''Lima Province''' is located in the central coast of [[Peru]] and is the only [[Provinces of Peru|province]] in the country not belonging to any of the [[Regions of Peru|twenty-five regions]], thus being quasi-autonomous. Its capital is [[Lima]], which is also the nation's capital.

Despite its small area, this province is the major [[Industrial sector|industrial]] and [[Economic system|economic]] powerhouse of the Peruvian economy. It concentrates almost one-third of the country's population and 50% of Peru's [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] in 2012.

==History==
The province was created in 1821, as Peru's territory was divided into [[Departments of Peru|departments]], [[Provinces of Peru|provinces]], [[Districts of Peru|districts]] and [[parish]]es. The province was part of the [[Lima Department]], which was formed by the territories of present-day [[Lima Region|Lima]], [[Callao Region|Callao]] and [[Ica Region|Ica]] regions, and the provinces of [[Casma Province|Casma]], [[Huarmey Province|Huarmey]] and [[Santa Province|Santa]], which later would be part of the ''La Costa Department''.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

The department was further subdivided as time passed but the Lima Province kept being part of it. Due to the massive migration from other areas of the country, the need to separate the province from the rest of the department was forecast by experts.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

In 2002, the new regionalization law passed by President [[Alejandro Toledo]] made the Lima Province a separate entity from the rest of the newly created [[Lima Region]].

==Political division==

The province is divided into 43 [[districts of Lima]]. Each of them is headed by a [[mayor]], although the [[Metropolitan Municipality of Lima]] (''Municipalidad Metropolitana de Lima''), led by the [[mayor of Lima]], also exercises its authority in these districts. These districts are grouped together into four sectors: Central Lima, [[Cono Norte|North Lima]], [[Cono Este|East Lima]], and [[Cono Sur (Lima)|South Lima]].{{Cn|date=January 2023}}

All the districts of Lima province are fused together in a continuous [[Lima metropolitan area|urban area]], with the exception of the [[beach resort]] of [[Ancón District|Ancón]] and [[Santa Rosa District, Lima|Santa Rosa]] in the north and [[Punta Hermosa]], [[Punta Negra District|Punta Negra]], [[San Bartolo District|San Bartolo]], [[Santa María del Mar District (Peru)|Santa Maria del Mar]] and [[Pucusana District|Pucusana]] in the south.{{Cn|date=January 2023}}

==Boundaries==
* North: [[Huaral Province]]
* Northeast: [[Canta Province]]
* East: [[Huarochirí Province]]
* South: [[Cañete Province]]
* West: [[Callao Province]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]].

==Government==

Lima Province is administered by the Metropolitan Municipality of Lima (''Municipalidad Metropolitana de Lima''), which also administers the city of Lima. Its current mayor is [[Rafael López Aliaga|Rafael Bernardo López Aliaga Cazorla]] <small>(2023–2026)</small>.
