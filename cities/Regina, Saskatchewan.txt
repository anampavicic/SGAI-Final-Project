===Early history (1882–1945)===
Regina was established as the territorial seat of government in 1882 when [[Edgar Dewdney]], the [[lieutenant-governor]] of the [[North-West Territories]], insisted on the site over the better developed [[Battleford]], [[Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan|Troy]] and [[Fort Qu'Appelle]] (the latter some {{cvt|30|mi|order=flip}} to the east, one on rolling plains and the other in the Qu'Appelle Valley between two lakes).{{Clarify|reason=unclear which location pertains to which place|date=June 2024}} These communities were considered better locations for what was anticipated to be a [[metropole]] for the Canadian plains. These locations had ample access to water and resided on treed rolling parklands. "Pile-of-Bones", as the site for Regina was then called (or, in Cree, {{lang|cr|ᐅᐢᑲᓇ ᑳᐊᓵᐢᑌᑭ}} ''Oskana kâ-asastêki''),<ref>[http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/regina.html Daria Coneghan, "Regina," ''Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan''.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429215846/http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/regina.html |date=29 April 2008 }}.

Lieutenant-Governor [[Edgar Dewdney|Dewdney]] had acquired land adjacent to the route of the future CPR line at Pile-of-Bones, which was distinguished only by collections of bison bones near a small spring run-off creek, some few kilometres downstream from its origin in the midst of what are now wheat fields. There was an "obvious conflict of interest" in Dewdney's choosing the site of Pile-of-Bones as the territorial seat of government<ref>After his term as Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories, Dewdney was again elected to Parliament and served as the member for Assiniboia East (now southeastern Saskatchewan) from 1888 to 1891. During this period he also served as minister of the Interior and superintendent of Indian Affairs. In 1892 he was appointed to the now non-executive post of Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia. He served in this post until 1897. He retired from politics in 1900 after unsuccessfully running for Parliament in New Westminster, British Columbia</ref> and it was a national scandal at the time.<ref>Pierre Berton, ''The Last Spike: The Great Railway 1881–1885'' (Toronto: McLelland and Stewart, 1973), 120</ref> But until 1897, when [[responsible government]] was accomplished in the Territories,<ref>David J.

Commercial considerations prevailed and the town's authentic development soon began as a collection of wooden shanties and tent shacks clustered around the site designated by the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] for its future station, some {{cvt|2|mi|order=flip}} to the east of where Dewdney had reserved substantial landholdings for himself and where he sited the Territorial (now the Saskatchewan) [[Government House (Saskatchewan)|Government House]].<ref>Pierre Berton, ''The Last Spike: The Great Railway 1881–1885'' (Toronto: McLelland and Stewart, 1973), pp.121–23)</ref>

Regina was incorporated as a city on 19 June 1903, with the MLA who introduced the charter bill, [[James B. Hawkes|James Hawkes]], declaring, "Regina has the brightest future before it of any place in the North West Territories".<ref>Mein, Lillian; Mein, Stewart (eds), ''Regina, The Street Where You Live: The Origins of Regina Street Names'', 1979, Regina Public Library</ref> Several years later the city was proclaimed the capital of the 1905 province of Saskatchewan on 23 May 1906, by the first provincial government, led by Premier [[Thomas Walter Scott|Walter Scott]]; the monumental [[Saskatchewan Legislative Building]] was built between 1908 and 1912.
[[File:Damage to buildings on Lorne St. after cyclone.jpg|thumb|left|In June 1912, a [[tornado]] locally referred to as the [[Regina Cyclone]] devastated the city. The tornado remains the deadliest recorded tornado in Canadian history.]]
The "[[Regina Cyclone]]" was a tornado that devastated the city on 30 June 1912 and remains the deadliest tornado in Canadian history, with a total of 28 fatalities, the population of the city having been 30,213 in 1911. Green funnel clouds formed and touched down south of the city, tearing a swath through the residential area between Wascana Lake and Victoria Avenue, continuing through the downtown business district, rail yards, warehouse district, and northern residential area.

From 1920 to 1926 Regina used [[Single transferable vote]] (STV), a form of proportional representation, to elect its councillors. Councillors were elected in one at-large district. Each voter cast just a single vote, using a ranked transferable ballot.<ref>Grofman, Elections in Australia, Ireland and Malta Using STV</ref>

Regina grew rapidly until the beginning of the [[Great Depression]], in 1929, though only to a small fraction of the originally anticipated population explosion as population centre of the new province. By this time, Saskatchewan was considered the third province of Canada<ref>[http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/0501cfen.htm Kevin Avram, "A tale of two provinces," ''Farmers for economic freedom: Updates from the Prairie Centre/Centre for Prairie Agriculture in Regina, Saskatchewan.''

Retrieved 11 December 2007.</ref> in both population and economic indicators. Thereafter, Saskatchewan never recovered its early promise and Regina's growth slowed and at times reversed.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In 1933, Regina hosted the first national convention [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (predecessor of the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|NDP]]). At the convention, the CCF adopted a programme known as the [[Regina Manifesto]], which set out the new party's goals.<ref>J.T. Morley, [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/co-operative-commonwealth-federation/ "Co-operative Commonwealth Federation,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920083519/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/co-operative-commonwealth-federation/ |date=20 September 2017 }} ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''. Retrieved 18 November 2007.</ref> In 1935, Regina gained notoriety for the Regina Riot, an incident of the [[On-to-Ottawa Trek]]. (See [[History of Regina, Saskatchewan|The Depression, the CCF and the Regina Riot]].) Beginning in the 1930s, Regina became known as a centre of considerable political activism and experimentation as its people sought to adjust to new, reduced economic realities, including the co-operative movement and medicare.

This, with the proliferation of shopping malls beginning in the 1960s and "[[big box store]]s" in the 1990s on the periphery, together with a corresponding drift of entertainment venues (and all but one downtown cinema) to the city outskirts, had depleted the city centre. The former [[Hudson's Bay (retailer)|Hudson's Bay Company]] department store (previously the site of the Regina Theatre though long vacant after that burned to the ground) has been converted into offices; [[Globe Theatre, Regina|Globe Theatre]], located in the [[Prince Edward Building (Regina)|old Post Office]] building at 11th Avenue and Scarth Street, [[Casino Regina]] and its show lounge in the former CPR train station, the [[Cornwall Centre (Regina, Saskatchewan)|Cornwall Centre]] and downtown restaurants now draw people downtown again.

In recent years the pattern of primary and high school grounds being acreages of prairie sports grounds has been re-thought and such grounds have been landscaped with artificial hills and parks. Newer residential subdivisions in the northwest and southeast have, instead of spring runoff storm sewers, decorative landscaped lagoons.

The streetscape is now endangered by [[Dutch elm disease]], which has spread through North America from the eastern seaboard and has now reached the Canadian prairies; for the time being it is controlled by pest management programs and species not susceptible to the disease are being planted; the disease has the potential to wipe out Regina's elm population.<ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/dutch-elm-disease-found-in-4-regina-trees-1.633921?ref=rss CBC "Saskatchewan Story" article on Regina's trees] </ref><ref>[http://www.regina.ca/trees/ded.htm Dutch Elm Disease Control Program.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127193133/http://www.regina.ca/trees/ded.htm |date=27 November 2007 }}</ref>

From its first founding, particularly once motorcars were common, Reginans have retired to the nearby [[Qu'Appelle Valley]] on weekends, for summer and winter holidays and indeed as a place to live permanently and commute from. Since the 1940s, many of the towns near Regina have steadily lost population<ref>Mark Partridge, "The Ebb and Flow of Rural Growth: Spread, Backwash, or Stagnation."

Some of these towns have enjoyed something of a renaissance as a result of the excellent roads that for many decades seemed likely to doom them; they – and to some extent the nearby city of [[Moose Jaw]] – are now undergoing a mild resurgence as commuter satellites for Regina. [[Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan|Qu'Appelle]], at one time intended to be the metropole for the original District of Assiniboia in the North-West Territories (as they then were), saw during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s Regina cottagers pass through en route to the Qu'Appelle Valley; Highway 10, which bypassed Qu'Appelle, running directly from Balgonie to Fort Qu'Appelle off Highway Number 1, quickly ended this.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture in Regina}}
Regina has a substantial cultural life in music, theatre and dance, supported by the fine arts constituency at the University of Regina, which has faculties of music, theatre and arts. At various times this has attracted notable artistic talent: the [[Regina Five]] were artists at Regina College (the university's predecessor) who gained national fame in the 1950s. The long-established [[MacKenzie Art Gallery]] once occupied cramped quarters adjacent to Darke Hall on the University of Regina College Avenue Campus; since relocated to a large building at the southwest corner of the provincial government site, at Albert Street near 23rd Avenue. [[Donald M. Kendrick]], [[Robert Boyer (artist)|Bob Boyer]] and [[Joe Fafard]], now with significant international reputations, have been other artists from or once in Regina.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

But until the demolition of downtown cinemas which doubled as live theatres the lack was not urgent, and Darke Hall on the Regina College campus of the university provided a small concert and stage venue.

===Parks and attractions===
Regina has a substantial proportion of its overall area dedicated as parks and green spaces, with biking paths, cross-country skiing venues, and other recreational facilities throughout the city. Wascana Lake, the venue for summer boating activities, is regularly cleared of snow in winter for skating, and there are toboggan runs both in Wascana Centre and downstream on the banks of Wascana Creek. [[Victoria Park, Regina|Victoria Park]] is in the central business district and numerous green spaces throughout the residential subdivisions and subdivisions in the north and west of the city contain large ornamental ponds to add interest to residential precincts such as Rochdale, Lakewood, Lakeridge, Spruce Meadows, and Windsor Park.

By the 1920s, with Boggy Creek as a source of domestic water and wells into the aquifer under Regina, Wascana Lake had ceased to have a utilitarian purpose and had become a primarily recreational facility, with bathing and boating its principal uses. It was drained in the 1930s as part of a government relief project; 2,100 men widened and dredged the lake bed and created two islands using only hand tools and horse-drawn wagons.<ref name="Riddell, W. A. 1962"/>

During the fall and winter of 2003–2004, Wascana Lake was again [[Big Dig (Regina, Saskatchewan)|drained and dredged]] to deepen it while adding a new island, a promenade area beside Albert Street Bridge, water fountains, and a waterfall to help aerate the lake.<ref>[http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/big_dig.html Dagmar Skamlová, "Big Dig," ''Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan''.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225185755/http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/big_dig.html |date=25 December 2008 }}.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary schooling===
{{Main|List of schools in Regina, Saskatchewan}}
[[File:CampbellCollegiate09.jpg|thumb|[[Campbell Collegiate]] is one of eight secondary schools operated by the secular English-language [[Regina Board of Education]].]]
The [[Regina Public School Board]] currently operates 45 elementary schools and 9 high schools with approximately 21,000 students enrolled throughout the city. The publicly funded [[Regina Catholic Schools]] [[Separate School]] Board operates 25 elementary schools and 4 high schools, and has a current enrollment of approximately 10,000 students. Public and separate schools are amply equipped with state-of-the-art science labs, gymnasia, drama and arts facilities: already by the 1960s, Regina high schools had television studios, swimming pools, ice rinks and drama facilities. Francophone public schools are operated by the [[Conseil des écoles fransaskoises]].

A small number of parents choose to opt out of the public and separate school systems for home-schooling under the guidance of the Regina Public School Board. Luther College (affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada) is a historical, independent high school; the Regina Huda School offers Islamic education; Harvest City Christian Academy is a private school (occupying the former Sister McGuigan High School site); and the Regina Christian School (in the former Campion College premises) operates as an Associate school of the Regina Public School Division. Historically there were eminent private schools long since closed: Regina College, now the University of Regina but originally a private high school of the Methodist Church of Canada (since 1925 the United Church); the Anglican St Chad's School; the Roman Catholic Campion College, Sacred Heart Academy and Marian High School.

===University of Regina===
{{Main|University of Regina}}
[[File:John Archer Library, University of Regina.jpg|thumb|John Archer Library at the [[University of Regina]]. Established in 1911, the institution is the oldest university located in the city.]]
In the years prior to the establishment of the [[University of Saskatchewan]], there was continued debate as to which Saskatchewan city would be awarded the provincial university: ultimately Saskatoon won out over Regina and in immediate reaction the [[Methodist Church of Canada]] established Regina College in 1911. Regina College was initially a denominational high school and junior college affiliated with the University of Saskatchewan – the later-established [[Campion College, Regina|Campion]] and [[Luther College (Saskatchewan)|Luther]] Colleges, operated by the Roman Catholic [[Jesuit Order]] and [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada|Lutheran Church]] respectively, operated on the same basis. The [[Anglican Church of Canada|Church of England]] concurrently established St Chad's College, an Anglican theological training facility, and the Qu'Appelle Diocesan School on the Anglican diocesan property immediately to the east of Regina College on College Avenue. All were quasi-tertiary institutions.

Ultimately, the financially hard-pressed [[United Church of Canada]] (the successor to the Methodist Church), which in any case had ideological difficulties with the concept of fee-paying private schooling given its longstanding espousal of universal free education from the time of its early father [[Egerton Ryerson]], could no longer maintain Regina College during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, and Regina College was disaffiliated from the Church and surrendered to the University of Saskatchewan; it became the Regina Campus of the [[University of Saskatchewan]] in 1961. After a protracted contretemps over the siting of several faculties in Saskatoon which had been promised to the Regina campus, Regina Campus sought and obtained a separate charter as the [[University of Regina]] in 1974.

[[Campion College, Regina|Campion College]] and [[Luther College (Saskatchewan)|Luther College]] now have [[federated college]] status in the University of Regina, as does the [[First Nations University of Canada]];<ref>*[http://www.firstnationsuniversity.ca/ First Nations University of Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829224800/http://www.firstnationsuniversity.ca/ |date=29 August 2008 }}. Retrieved 17 July 2007.</ref> The United Church's Regina College has entirely consolidated with the University of Saskatchewan and identified with St Andrew's College there: despite the considerable historical involvement by the Methodist, Presbyterian and Anglican churches in antecedent institutions of the University of Regina. The [[Regina Research Park]] is located immediately adjacent to the main campus and many of its initiatives in information technology, petroleum and environmental sciences are conducted in conjunction with university departments. A member in the research park is Canada's Petroleum Technology Research facility, a world leader in [[Petroleum extraction|oil recovery]] and geological storage of CO<sub >2</sub>.

===RCMP Academy, Depot Division===
[[File:RCMP cadets.JPG|thumb|RCMP cadets at the RCMP Academy's Depot Division. The Depot has been providing RCMP training since its establishment in 1885.]]
{{Main|RCMP Academy, Depot Division}}
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police Academy, "Depot" Division, is on the western perimeter of the city. As capital of the North-West Territories, Regina was the headquarters of the [[North-West Mounted Police|Royal North-West Mounted Police]] (the RCMP's predecessor) before "the Force" became a national body with its headquarters in [[Ottawa]] in 1920. The city takes great pride in this national institution which is a major visitor attraction and a continuing link with Regina's past as the headquarters of the Force, together with longstanding substantial enrollment by trainees from across Canada, obtaining entertainment and recreation citywide. It offers sunset ceremonies and parade in the summertime. The national RCMP music and "Depot" Division chapel (the oldest building still standing in the city) are major visitor attractions in Regina. The first phase of a [[RCMP Heritage Centre]] successor to the longstanding museum opened in May 2007.

==Infrastructure==
[[File:SaskPower Building, Regina.jpg|thumb|Headquarters for [[SaskPower]]. The provincial [[Crown corporation]] provides power for Regina, as well as maintains the provincial power grid.]]
Domestic water was originally obtained from Wascana Lake and later the Boggy Creek reservoir north of the city and supplemented by wells, however by the 1940s this was proving inadequate to meet the city's water supply needs. Today, drinking water is supplied from Buffalo Pound Lake in the [[Qu'Appelle River|Qu'Appelle Valley]], an artificial reservoir on the [[Qu'Appelle River]], since 1967 with water diverted into it from [[Lake Diefenbaker]] behind the [[Gardiner Dam]] on the [[South Saskatchewan River]].<ref>[http://www.ilec.or.jp/database/nam/nam-57.html World Lakes Database: Buffalo Pound Lake.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227180400/http://www.ilec.or.jp/database/nam/nam-57.html |date=27 December 2008 }}.

==Transportation==
===Public transportation===
The city's public transit agency, [[Regina Transit]], operates a fleet of 110 buses, on 17 routes, and 4 express routes. The service runs 7 days a week with access to the city centre from most areas of the city. Regina formerly had an extensive [[streetcar]] (tramway) network but now has no streetcars, trains or subways. A massive fire at the streetcar barns, on 23 January 1949, destroyed much of the rolling stock of streetcars and trolley buses<ref>{{cite web |url=http://scaa.usask.ca/gallery/regina/north/fire_dept.html |title=Regina: The Early Years 1880–1950 |publisher=Scaa.usask.ca |access-date=14 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312133443/http://scaa.usask.ca/gallery/regina/north/fire_dept.html |archive-date=12 March 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> and helped to propel Regina's diesel bus revolution in 1951, although until well into the 1970s the streetcar rails remained in the centre of many major streets, ready to be returned to use should city transit policy change. Because of the 1949 fire, original Regina streetcar rolling stock was rare, though through later years a few disused streetcars remained in evidence – a streetcar with takeaway food, for example, on the site of the Regina Theatre at 12th Avenue and Hamilton Street, until the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] acquired the site and built its 60s-through-90s department store there.

Major roads in the city include [[Ring Road (Regina, Saskatchewan)|Ring Road]], a high speed connection between Regina's east and northwest that loops around the city's east side. The west side of the loop is formed by a south-north route, [[Lewvan Drive & Pasqua Street|Lewvan Drive, which becomes Pasqua Street in the city's north end]]. This route connects the [[Trans-Canada Highway|Trans-Canada highway]] and [[Saskatchewan Highway 11|Highway 11]].

===Inter-city transportation===

By road, Regina can be reached by several highways including the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] from the west and east sides and four provincial highways ([[Saskatchewan Highway 6|6]], [[Saskatchewan Highway 11|11]], [[Saskatchewan Highway 33|33]], [[Saskatchewan Highway 46|46]]) from other directions.

By air, [[Regina International Airport]] serves Regina and area. As of January 2023, non-stop scheduled flights go to and from [[Calgary International Airport|Calgary]], [[Edmonton International Airport|Edmonton]], [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Toronto]], [[Vancouver International Airport|Vancouver]], and [[Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport|Winnipeg]]. There are seasonal flights to and from [[Montréal–Trudeau International Airport|Montreal]] (summer), Las Vegas, Orlando, Phoenix, and destinations in Mexico and the Caribbean (winter).[https://www.yqr.ca/en/traveller-info/flight-information/where-we-fly] The airport is situated on the west side of the city and is the oldest established commercial airport in Canada.<ref name="Coneghan" /> The current, continually expanded, 1960 terminal replaces the original 1940 [[Art Deco]] terminal; it has recently undergone further major upgrades and expansions to allow it to handle increases in traffic for the next several years. Private aircraft is facilitated at the Regina Flying Club and Western Air hangars near the Regina International Airport.

By bus, Rider Express, whose Regina office and stop are located at 1517 11th Avenue,[https://riderexpress.ca/locations/] provides direct inter-city bus service from Regina to centres along the Trans-Canada Highway and Highway 11.[https://riderexpress.ca/routes/] The [[Saskatchewan Transportation Company|Saskatchewan Transportation Company (STC)]], a Saskatchewan Crown Corporation, provided bus service in the province until it was shut down in 2017.[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/saskatchewan-bus-company-stc-end-service-shut-down-1.4036612] [[Greyhound Canada]] discontinued service in Saskatchewan and Western Canada in 2018.[https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/greyhound-western-canada-1.4884374] The five decades-old bus depot on Hamilton Street immediately south of the Hotel Saskatchewan was replaced in 2008 by one at 1717 Saskatchewan Drive (corner of Saskatchewan Drive and Broad Street).
