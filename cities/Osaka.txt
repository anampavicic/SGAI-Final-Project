{{nihongo|'''Osaka'''|大阪市|Ōsaka-shi|{{IPA|ja|oːsakaɕi|pron}}; commonly just {{Nihongo2|大阪}}, {{transliteration|ja|Ōsaka}} {{IPA|ja|oːsaka||ja-Osaka.ogg}}|lead=yes}} is a [[Cities designated by government ordinance of Japan|designated city]] in the [[Kansai region]] of [[Honshu]] in [[Japan]], and one of the three major cities of [[Japan]] ([[Tokyo]]-Osaka-[[Nagoya]]). It is the capital of and most populous city in [[Osaka Prefecture]], and the [[List of cities in Japan|third-most populous city]] in Japan, following the [[special wards of Tokyo]] and [[Yokohama]]. With a population of 2.7 million in the 2020 census, it is also the largest component of the [[Keihanshin|Keihanshin Metropolitan Area]], which is the [[List of metropolitan areas in Japan|second-largest metropolitan area in Japan]]<ref name="stats-boj"/> and the 10th-[[List of urban areas by population|largest urban area]] in the world with more than 19 million inhabitants.<ref name="japan2"/>

Ōsaka was traditionally considered Japan's economic hub. By the [[Kofun period]] (300–538) it had developed into an important regional port, and in the 7th and 8th centuries, it served briefly as the imperial capital. Osaka continued to flourish during the [[Edo period]] (1603–1867) and became known as a center of Japanese culture. Following the [[Meiji Restoration]], Osaka greatly expanded in size and underwent rapid industrialization. In 1889, Osaka was officially established as a municipality. The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades, and by the 1900s, Osaka was the industrial hub in the [[Meiji (era)|Meiji]] and [[Taishō]] periods. Osaka made noted contributions to redevelopment, urban planning and zoning standards in the postwar period, and the city developed rapidly as one of the major financial centers in the Keihanshin Metropolitan Area.

Osaka is a major financial center of Japan, and it is recognized as one of the most [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] and [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] cities in Japan. The city is home to the [[Osaka Exchange]] as well as the headquarters of multinational [[electronics]] corporations such as [[Panasonic]] and [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]]. Osaka is an international center of research and development and is represented by several major universities, notably [[Osaka University]], [[Osaka Metropolitan University]], and [[Kansai University]]. Famous landmarks in the city include [[Osaka Castle]], [[Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan]], [[Dōtonbori]], [[Tsūtenkaku]] in [[Shinsekai]], [[Tennōji Park]], [[Abenobashi Terminal Building|Abeno Harukas]], [[Sumiyoshi Taisha|Sumiyoshi Taisha Grand Shrine]], and [[Shitennō-ji]], one of the oldest Buddhist temples in Japan.

== Etymology ==
''Ōsaka'' means "large hill" or "large slope". It is unclear when this name gained prominence over Naniwa, but the oldest written evidence for the name dates back to 1496.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJHArhRVYEoC&pg=PA154|first=Ōta|last=Gyūichi|publisher=Brill Publishers|isbn=978-90-04-20162-0|title=The Chronicle of Lord Nobunaga|pages=153–154|year=2011|access-date=July 16, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=voerPYsAB5wC&pg=PA650|editor1-last=Ring |editor1-first=Trudy|editor2-last=Watson|editor2-first=Noelle|editor3-last=Schellinger|editor3-first=Paul|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-884964-04-4|title=Asia & Oceania: International Dictionary of Historic Places|page=650|year=1996|access-date=July 16, 2019}}</ref>

By the [[Edo period]], {{Nihongo2|大坂}} (''Ōsaka'') and {{Nihongo2|大阪}} (''Ōsaka'') were mixed use, and the writer {{ill|Hamamatsu Utakuni|ja|浜松歌国}}, in his book ''Setsuyo Ochiboshu'' published in 1808, states that the [[kanji]] {{Nihongo2|坂}} was abhorred because it "returns to the earth," and then {{Nihongo2|阪}} was used. The kanji {{Nihongo2|土}} (earth) is also similar to the word {{Nihongo2|士}} (knight), and {{Nihongo2|反}} means against, so {{Nihongo2|坂}} can be understood as "samurai rebellion," then {{Nihongo2|阪}} was official name in 1868 after the [[Meiji Restoration]]. The older kanji (坂) is still in very limited use, usually only in historical contexts. As an abbreviation, the modern kanji {{Nihongo2|阪}} {{transliteration|ja|han}} refers to Osaka City or [[Osaka Prefecture]].

== History ==
{{For timeline}}

=== Origins: Jōmon and Yayoi period ===
During the [[Jōmon period]] (7,000 BCE), present-day Osaka was mostly submerged, and the {{Nihongo|[[Uemachi Plateau]]|上町台地|Uemachi Daichi}} formed a 12&nbsp;km long and 2.5&nbsp;km wide peninsula separating [[Kawachi Bay]] from the [[Seto Inland Sea]].<ref name="Uemachidaichi"/><ref name="plain"/> It is considered one of the first places where inhabitants of Japan settled, both for the favorable geological conditions, rich in fresh water and lush vegetation, and because its position was defensible against military attack.<ref name="Uemachidaichi">{{cite web |title=Uemachidaichi - A journey to ancient osaka |date=May 1, 2007 |url=http://www.osaka-info.jp/en/culture/2007may/01.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228011113/http://www.osaka-info.jp/en/culture/2007may/01.html |archive-date=December 28, 2012 |website=www.osaka-info.jp}}</ref>

At the beginning of the third century CE the grand shrine of [[Sumiyoshi-taisha]] was inaugurated near the harbor, commissioned by consort [[Empress Jingū]]. This [[Shinto]] shrine structure survived historical events,<ref>[http://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/tempio/ templi] www.treccani.it</ref> which inaugurated a new style in the construction of Shinto shrines, called [[Sumiyoshi-zukuri]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.city.osaka.lg.jp/contents/wdu020/sumiyoshi/english/view/view.html |title=Sumiyoshi Ward |website=www.city.osaka.lg.jp |date=April 21, 2011 |archive-date=December 1, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201030241/https://www.city.osaka.lg.jp/contents/wdu020/sumiyoshi/english/view/view.html}}</ref> The maritime panorama enjoyed from the shrine gardens inspired several artists, and nowadays the representations of that type of landscape are called ''Sumiyoshi drawings''.

=== Kofun period ===
By the [[Kofun period]], Osaka developed into a hub port connecting the region to the western part of Japan.

=== Asuka and Nara period ===
The [[Kojiki]] records that during 390–430 CE, there was an imperial palace located at Osumi, in what is present day [[Higashiyodogawa-ku, Osaka|Higashiyodogawa ward]], but it may have been a secondary imperial residence rather than a capital.<ref>{{Nihongo2|大石慎三郎「日本の遷都の系譜」、『學習院大學經濟論集』第28巻第3号、学習院大学、1991年10月、 31–41頁}}、 NAID 110007523974。P.31</ref>

Naniwa was declared the capital again in 744 by order of [[Emperor Shōmu]], and remained so until 745, when the Imperial Court moved back to [[Heijō-kyō]] (now [[Nara (city)|Nara]]).

=== Heian to Edo period ===
In 1496, [[Jōdo Shinshū]] [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] established their headquarters in the heavily fortified [[Ishiyama Hongan-ji]], located directly on the site of the old Naniwa Imperial Palace. [[Oda Nobunaga]] began a decade-long siege campaign on the temple in 1570 which ultimately resulted in the surrender of the monks and subsequent razing of the temple. [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] constructed [[Osaka Castle]] in its place in 1583.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osaka-info.jp/en/discover/learn/historical_overview.html|title=HISTORICAL OVERVIEW – DISCOVER – OSAKA INFO -Osaka Visitors' Guide|date=January 29, 2018|access-date=September 19, 2016|archive-date=September 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923040308/http://www.osaka-info.jp/en/discover/learn/historical_overview.html}}</ref> Osaka Castle played a pivotal role in the [[Siege of Osaka]] (1614–1615).

Over the course of the [[Edo period]] (1603–1867), Osaka grew into one of Japan's major cities and returned to its ancient role as a lively and important port. ''[[Daimyō]]s'' (feudal lords) received most of their income in the form of [[rice]]. [[chonin|Merchants]] in Osaka thus began to organize [[Warehouse|storehouse]]s where they would store a ''daimyō''{{'}}s rice in exchange for a fee, trading it for either coin or a form of receipt; essentially a precursor to [[Banknote|paper money]]. Many if not all of these [[rice brokers]] also made loans, and would actually become quite wealthy and powerful. Osaka merchants coalesced their shops around [[Dōjima]], where the [[Dōjima Rice Exchange|Rice Exchange]] was established in 1697 and where the world's first [[Futures exchange|futures]] market would come to exist to sell rice that was not yet harvested.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Moss|first1=David A.|last2=Kintgen|first2=Eugene|date=2009-01-30|title=The Dojima Rice Market and the Origins of Futures Trading |website=Harvard Business School |url=https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=36846|language=en-us}}</ref>

Osaka residents were stereotyped in Edo literature from at least the 18th century. [[Jippensha Ikku]] in 1802 depicted Osakans as stingy almost beyond belief. In 1809, the derogatory term "Kamigata zeeroku" was used by Edo residents to characterize inhabitants of the Osaka region in terms of calculation, shrewdness, lack of civic spirit, and the vulgarity of Osaka dialect. Edo writers aspired to samurai culture, and saw themselves as poor but generous, chaste, and public spirited. Edo writers by contrast saw "zeeroku" as obsequious apprentices, stingy, greedy, gluttonous, and lewd. To some degree, Osaka residents are still stigmatized by Tokyo observers in the same way today, especially in terms of gluttony, evidenced in the phrase, {{Nihongo4|"Residents of Osaka devour their food until they collapse"|大阪は食倒れ|"Ōsaka wa kuidaore"}}.<ref>Richard Torrance, "Literacy and Literature in Osaka, 1890–1940", ''The Journal of Japanese Studies'' 31#1 (Winter 2005), pp. 27–60</ref>

=== Meiji to Heisei period ===
With the enormous changes that characterized the country after the [[Meiji Restoration]] (1868), and the relocation of the capital from [[Kyoto]] to [[Tokyo]], Osaka entered a period of decline. From being the capital of the economy and finance, it became a predominantly industrial center.<ref name="osaka-info.jp"/> The modern municipality was established<ref name="osaka-info.jp">{{cite web |url=http://www.osaka-info.jp/en/about/historical.html |title=Osaka city |publisher=Osaka-info.jp |access-date=May 5, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306155741/http://www.osaka-info.jp/en/about/historical.html |archive-date=March 6, 2010 }}</ref> in 1889 by [[City designated by government ordinance|government ordinance]], with an initial area of {{convert|15|km2|0|abbr=out}}, overlapping today's [[Chūō-ku, Osaka|Chuo]] and [[Nishi-ku, Osaka|Nishi]] wards. Later, the city went through three major expansions to reach its current size of {{convert|223|km2|0|abbr=out}}. Osaka was the industrial center most clearly defined in the development of capitalism in Japan. It became known as the "[[Manchester]] and [[Melbourne]] of the Orient".<ref name="osaka-info.jp"/> In 1925, it was the largest and most populous city in Japan and sixth in the world.<ref name="osaka-info.jp"/>

Like its European and American counterparts, Osaka displayed slums, unemployment, and poverty. In Japan it was here that municipal government first introduced a comprehensive system of poverty relief, copied in part from British models. Osaka policymakers stressed the importance of family formation and mutual assistance as the best way to combat poverty. This minimized the cost of welfare programs.<ref>Kingo Tamai, "Images of the Poor in an Official Survey of Osaka, 1923–1926."

During [[World War II]], [[Bombing of Osaka|Osaka came under air raids]] in 1945 by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] as part of the [[air raids on Japan]]. On March 13, 1945, a total of 329 [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] [[heavy bombers]] took part in the raid against Osaka. According to an American [[prisoner of war]] who was held in the city, the air raid took almost the entire night and destroyed {{convert|25|sqmi|km2}} of the city. The U.S. bombed the city again twice in June 1945 and again on August 14, a day before [[Japan's surrender]].<ref>Andy Raskin, "The Ramen King and I: How the Inventor of Instant Noodles Fixed My Love Life".</ref>

In the decades after World War II, the reconstruction plan and the industriousness of its inhabitants ensured Osaka even greater prosperity than it had before the war. Osaka's population regrew to more than three million in the 1960s when large-scale prefectural suburbanization began and doubled to six million by the 1990s. The factories were rebuilt and trade revived, the city were developed rapidly it became a major multicultural and financial center in the postwar period [[Japanese economic miracle|between the 1950s and the 1980s]], it is known as the "[[Chicago]] and [[Toronto]] of the Orient".{{quote without source|date=November 2022}} Osaka Prefecture was chosen as the venue for the prestigious [[Expo '70]], the first [[world's fair]] ever held in an Asian country. Since then, numerous international events have been held in Osaka, including the 1995 [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC Summit]].

The modern municipality, which when it was established in 1889 occupied an area of just 15&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> including the districts of Chūō and Nishi, following three successive expansions has reached an area of 222&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.

The plan to reorganize Osaka and its province into a metropolis like Tokyo met with stiff opposition in some municipalities, particularly the highly populated [[Sakai]]. He{{Who|date=May 2024}} then fell back on a project that included the suppression of the 24 wards of Osaka, thus dividing the city into 5 new special districts with a status similar to that of the 23 [[Special wards of Tokyo]]. It was introduced by former mayor [[Tōru Hashimoto]], leader of the reform party [[Osaka Restoration Association]] which he founded. The referendum of May 17, 2015 called in Osaka for the approval of this project saw the narrow victory of no, and consequently Hashimoto announced his withdrawal from politics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/05/17/national/politics-diplomacy/osaka-referendum-rejects-merger-plan-possibly-ending-hashimotos-political-career/ |title=Hashimoto announces exit from politics after Osaka rejects merger plan in referendum |date=May 19, 2017|language= en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201127212535/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/05/17/national/politics-diplomacy/osaka-referendum-rejects-merger-plan-possibly-ending-hashimotos-political-career/ |archive-date=November 27, 2020}}</ref> A second referendum for a merger into 4 semi-autonomous wards was narrowly voted down by 692,996 (50.6%).<ref name="metropolis-2020"/>

The city's west side is open to [[Osaka Bay]], and is otherwise completely surrounded by more than ten satellite cities, all of them in [[Osaka Prefecture]], with one exception: the city of [[Amagasaki]], belonging to [[Hyōgo Prefecture]], in the northwest. The city occupies a larger area (about 13%) than any other city or village within Osaka Prefecture. When the city was established in 1889, it occupied roughly the area known today as the Chuo and Nishi wards, only {{Convert|15.27|km2|mi2|0}} that would eventually grow into today's {{Convert|222.30|km2|mi2|0}} via incremental expansions, the largest of which being a single {{Convert|126.01|km2|mi2|0|adj=on}} expansion in 1925.

=== Climate ===
Osaka is located in the [[humid subtropical climate]] zone ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), with four distinct seasons. Its winters are generally mild, with January being the coldest month having an average high of {{convert|9.7|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The city rarely sees snowfall during the winter. Spring in Osaka starts off mild, but ends up being hot and humid. It also tends to be Osaka's wettest season, with the {{Nihongo4|''[[East Asian rainy season|tsuyu]]''|梅雨|tsuyu|"plum rain"}}—the rainy season—occurring between early June and late July. The average starting and ending dates of the rainy season are June 7 and July 21 respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.data.jma.go.jp/fcd/yoho/baiu/kako_baiu07.html |script-title=ja:気象庁 - 過去の梅雨入りと梅雨明け（近畿）|script-website=ja:気象庁 |website=Japan Meteorological Agency}}</ref> Summers are very hot and humid. In August, the hottest month, the average daily high temperature reaches {{convert|33.7|°C|0|abbr=on}}, while average nighttime low temperatures typically hover around {{convert|25.8|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Fall in Osaka sees a cooling trend, with the early part of the season resembling summer while the latter part of fall resembles winter. Precipitation is abundant, with winter being the driest season, while monthly rainfall peaks in June with the "tsuyu" rainy season, which typically ends in mid to late July. From late July through the end of August, summer's heat and humidity peaks, and rainfall decreases somewhat. Osaka experiences a second rainy period in September and early October, when tropical weather systems, including typhoons, coming from the south or southwest are possible.

=== Neighborhoods ===
Central Osaka is roughly divided into downtown and uptown areas known as {{Nihongo4|'''Kita'''|[[:ja:キタ|キタ]]|extra="north"}} and {{Nihongo4|'''Minami'''|[[:ja:ミナミ|ミナミ]]|extra="south"}}.<ref name="japan-guide.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4009.html|title=Osaka Travel: Kita (Umeda)}}</ref><ref name="japan-guide.com1">{{cite web|url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4001.html|title=Osaka Travel: Minami (Namba)}}</ref>

Kita is home to the [[Umeda]] district and its immediate surrounding neighborhoods, a major business and retail hub that plays host to [[Ōsaka Station|Osaka Station City]] and a large subterranean network of shopping arcades.<ref name="japan-guide.com" /> Kita and nearby [[Nakanoshima]] contain a prominent portion of the city's skyscrapers and are often featured in photographs of Osaka's skyline.

Minami, though meaning "south", is essentially in {{Nihongo4|Chūō Ward|中央区|Chūō-ku}} and geographically central within the city.<ref name="japan-guide.com1" /> Well known districts here include [[Namba]] and [[Shinsaibashi]] shopping areas, the [[Dōtonbori]] canal entertainment area, [[Nipponbashi]] Den Den Town, as well as arts and fashion culture-oriented areas such as [[Amerikamura]] and Horie. The 300-meter tall [[Abenobashi Terminal Building|Abeno Harukas]] was the tallest skyscraper in the country from 2014 until 2023.<ref name="Tallest high-rise nears completion" />

The business districts between Kita and Minami such as {{Ill|Honmachi (Osaka)|lt=Honmachi|ja|本町 (大阪市)}} and {{Ill|Yodoyabashi|ja|淀屋橋}}, called {{Nihongo4|'''Semba'''|[[:ja:船場 (大阪市)|船場]]}}, house the regional headquarters of many large-scale banks and corporations. The [[Midōsuji]] boulevard runs through Semba and connects Kita and Minami.

Further south of Minami are neighborhoods such as [[Shinsekai]] (with its [[Tsutenkaku|Tsūtenkaku]] tower), [[Tennōji-ku, Osaka|Tennoji]] and [[Abeno-ku, Osaka|Abeno]] (with [[Tennōji Zoo|Tennoji Zoo]], [[Shitennō-ji]] and [[Abenobashi Terminal Building|Abeno Harukas]]), and the [[Kamagasaki]] slums, the largest slum in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wordpress.tokyotimes.org/kamagasaki-japans-biggest-slum/|title=Kamagasaki: Japan's biggest slum|date=April 8, 2014|access-date=July 10, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714183354/http://www.wordpress.tokyotimes.org/kamagasaki-japans-biggest-slum/|archive-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref>

The city's west side is a prominent [[Osaka Bay|bay area]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4010.html|title=Osaka Travel: Osaka Bay Area}}</ref> which serves as its main port as well as a tourist destination with attractions such as [[Kyocera Dome]], [[Universal Studios Japan]] and the [[Mount Tenpō|Tempozan Harbor Village]]. [[Higashiōsaka, Osaka|Higashiosaka]] is zoned as a separate city, although the east side of Osaka city proper contains numerous residential neighborhoods including [[Tsuruhashi Station|Tsuruhashi]] KoreaTown, as well as the [[Osaka Castle Park]], [[Osaka Business Park]] and the hub [[Kyōbashi Station (Osaka)|Kyōbashi Station]].

Osaka contains numerous urban canals and bridges, many of which serve as the namesake for their surrounding neighborhoods.<ref name="Eiichi Watanabe-2004">{{cite book |author=Eiichi Watanabe |author2=[[Dan M.

As many of the city's canals were gradually filled in, the number dropped to 872, of which 760 are currently managed by Osaka City.<ref name="Eiichi Watanabe-2004" />

{{See also|Kansai dialect}}
The commonly spoken dialect of this area is ''Osaka-ben'', a typical sub-dialect of ''Kansai-ben''. Of the many other particularities that characterize Osaka-ben, examples include using the copula ''ya'' instead of ''da'', and the suffix ''-hen'' instead of ''-nai'' in negative verb forms.

The [[Osaka City Council]] is the city's local government formed under the [[Local Autonomy Law]]. The council has eighty-nine seats, allocated to the twenty-four wards proportional to their population and re-elected by the citizens every four years. The council elects its president and Vice President. Toshifumi Tagaya ([[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|LDP]]) is the current and 104th president since May 2008. The mayor of the city is directly elected by the citizens every four years as well, in accordance with the Local Autonomy Law. [[Tōru Hashimoto]], former governor of [[Osaka Prefecture]] is the 19th mayor of Osaka since 2011. The mayor is supported by two vice mayors, currently Akira Morishita and Takashi Kashiwagi, who are appointed by him in accordance with the city bylaw.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city.osaka.lg.jp/contents/wdu020/shikai/english/index.html |title=Osaka City Council homepage |publisher=City.osaka.lg.jp |access-date=May 5, 2010}}</ref>

===Developments===
In July 2012, a joint multi-party bill was submitted to the Diet that would allow for implementation of the [[Osaka Metropolis plan]] as pursued by the mayor of Osaka city, the governor of Osaka and [[Osaka Restoration Association (1st)|their party]]. If implemented, Osaka City, neighboring [[Sakai, Osaka|Sakai]] City and possibly other surrounding municipalities would dissolve and be reorganized as four [[Special wards of Tokyo|special wards]] of Osaka prefecture – similar to former [[Tokyo City]]'s successor wards within Tokyo prefecture. Special wards are municipal-level administrative units that leave some otherwise municipal administrative responsibilities and [[revenues]] to the prefectural administration.<ref>[[The Japan Times]], July 31, 2012: [https://web.archive.org/web/20120730221419/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120731a2.html Bill to transform Osaka government jointly submitted to Diet]</ref>

On November 1, 2020, a second referendum to merge Osaka's 24 wards into 4 semi-autonomous wards was narrowly voted down. There were 692,996 (50.6%) votes against and 675,829 (49.4%) votes supported it.<ref name="metropolis-2020">{{cite web |title=Osaka referendum defeat raises questions about future of city's politics |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/11/02/national/politics-diplomacy/osaka-referendum-future/ |author=Eric Johnston |date=November 2, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201102090033/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/11/02/national/politics-diplomacy/osaka-referendum-future/ |archive-date=November 2, 2020}}</ref> Osaka mayor and Osaka Ishin co-leader [[Ichiro Matsui]] said he would resign when his term ends in 2023.<ref name="metropolis-2020"/>

=== Energy policies ===
==== Nuclear power ====
On February 27, 2012, three Kansai cities, [[Kyoto]], Osaka, and [[Kobe]], jointly asked [[Kansai Electric Power Company]] to break its dependence on nuclear power. In a letter to KEPCO they also requested to disclose information on the demand and supply of electricity, and for lower and stable prices. The three cities were stockholders of the plant: Osaka owned 9% of the shares, while Kobe had 3% and Kyoto 0.45%. Toru Hashimoto, the mayor of Osaka, announced a proposal to minimize the dependence on nuclear power for the shareholders meeting in June 2012.<ref>The Mainichi Shimbun (February 27, 2012)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120227p2g00m0dm044000c.html 3 major Kansai cities aim to break dependence on nuclear power] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120710025044/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120227p2g00m0dm044000c.html |date=July 10, 2012 }}</ref>

On March 18, 2012, the city of Osaka decided as largest shareholder of Kansai Electric Power Co, that at the next shareholders-meeting in June 2012 it would demand a series of changes:
* that Kansai Electric would be split into two companies, separating power generation from power transmission.
* a reduction of the number of the utility's executives and employees.
* the implementation of absolutely secure measurements to ensuring the safety of the nuclear facilities.
* the disposing of spent fuel.
* the installation of new kind of thermal power generation to secure non-nuclear supply of energy.
* selling all unnecessary assets including the stock holdings of KEPCO.
In this action, Osaka had secured the support of two other cities and shareholders: [[Kyoto]] and [[Kobe]], but with their combined voting-rights of 12.5 percent they were not certain of the ultimate outcome, because for this two-thirds of the shareholders would be needed to agree to revise the corporate charter.<ref>The Mainichi Shimbun (March 19, 2012) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120319p2g00m0dm011000c.html Osaka aims to end Kansai Electric's nuclear power ops as shareholder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319172039/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120319p2g00m0dm011000c.html|date=March 19, 2012}}</ref>

At a meeting held on April 10, 2012, by the "energy strategy council", formed by the city of Osaka and the governments of the prefectures, it became clear that at the end of the fiscal year 2011 some 69 employees of Kansai Electric Power Company were former public servants. "[[Amakudari]]" was the Japanese name for this practice of rewarding by hiring officials that formerly controlled and supervised the firm. Such people included the following:
* 13 ex-officials of the: Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism
* 3 ex-officials of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry,
* 2 ex-officials of the Ministry of the Environment,
* 16 former policemen,
* 10 former fire-fighters,
* 13 former civil engineers.

Besides this, it became known that Kansai Electric had done about 600 external financial donations, to a total sum of about 1.695&nbsp;billion yen:
* 70 donations were paid to local governments: to a total of 699&nbsp;million yen
* 100 donations to public-service organizations: 443&nbsp;million yen,
* 430 donations to various organizations and foundations: a total of 553&nbsp;million yen
During this meeting some 8 conditions were compiled, that needed to be fulfilled before a restart of the No.3 and No.4 reactors Oi Nuclear Power Plant:
* the consent of the local people and government within 100 kilometer from the plant
* the installation of a new independent regulatory agency
* a nuclear safety agreement
* the establishment of new nuclear safety standards
* stress tests and evaluations based on these new safety rules<ref>The Mainichi Shimbun (April 10, 2012) [http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120410p2a00m0na014000c.html Kansai Electric, affiliates had 69 ex-bureaucrats employed as execs as of end of fiscal 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414140532/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120410p2a00m0na014000c.html |date=April 14, 2012 }}</ref>

Historically, Osaka was the center of commerce in Japan, especially in the middle and pre-modern ages. [[Nomura Securities]], the first brokerage firm in Japan, was founded in the city in 1925, and Osaka still houses a leading futures exchange. Many major companies have since moved their main offices to Tokyo. However, several major companies, such as [[Panasonic]], [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]], and [[Sanyo]], are still headquartered in Osaka.

Major stations within the city include {{Nihongo4|[[Umeda Station|Umeda]]|梅田}}, {{Nihongo4|[[Namba Station|Namba]]|難波}}, {{Nihongo4|[[Shinsaibashi Station|Shinsaibashi]]|心斎橋}}, {{Nihongo4|[[Tennōji Station|Tennōji]]|天王寺}}, {{Nihongo4|[[Kyōbashi Station (Osaka)|Kyōbashi]]|京橋}}, and {{Nihongo4|[[Yodoyabashi Station|Yodoyabashi]]|淀屋橋}}.

Osaka connects to its surrounding cities and suburbs via the [[JR West]] [[Urban Network]] as well as numerous private lines such as [[Keihan Electric Railway]], [[Hankyu Railway]], [[Hanshin Electric Railway]], [[Kintetsu Railway]], and [[Nankai Electric Railway]].

The [[Osaka Metro]] system alone ranks 8th in the world by annual passenger ridership, serving over 912&nbsp;million people annually (a quarter of Greater Osaka Rail System's 4&nbsp;billion annual riders), despite being only 8 of more than 70 lines in the metro area.

All [[Shinkansen]] trains including ''[[Nozomi (train)|Nozomi]]'' stop at [[Shin-Ōsaka Station|Shin-Osaka Station]] and provide access to other major cities in Japan, such as Kobe, Kyoto, Nagoya, Yokohama, and Tokyo.

Regular bus services are provided by [[Osaka Municipal Transportation Bureau|Osaka City Bus]], as well Hankyu, Hanshin and Kintetsu, providing a dense network covering most parts of the city.

Osaka is served by two airports situated just outside of the city, [[Kansai International Airport]] ([[IATA]]: '''KIX''') which handles primarily international passenger flights and [[Osaka International Airport]] ([[IATA]]: '''ITM''') which handles mostly domestic services and some international cargo flights.

Due to its geographical position, Osaka's international ferry connections are far greater than that of Tokyo, with international service to Shanghai, [[Tianjin]], and [[Busan]] along with domestic routes to [[Kitakyushu]], [[Kagoshima]], [[Miyazaki, Miyazaki|Miyazaki]] and [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]].
