The English name ''Oriental'' is derived from the [[French language|French]] term ''L'Oriental'' (for "the east") and comes directly from the [[Latin]] ''orientalis'', "of the east", being that the region is located in the east of Morocco.<ref>{{cite web|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=oriental|website=www.etymonline.com|publisher=Douglas Harper|access-date=21 September 2015}}</ref> The Arabic name ''Ash-Sharq'' also means "the east".
