'''Giugliano in Campania''' ({{IPA|it|dʒuʎˈʎaːno iŋ kamˈpaːnja|lang}}), also known simply as '''Giugliano''', is a city and {{lang|it|[[comune]]}} (municipality) in the [[Metropolitan City of Naples]], [[Campania]], [[Italy]]. A suburb of Naples, as of 2017, it had some 124,000 inhabitants,<ref name="istat">{{in lang|it}} [http://demo.istat.it/pop2016/index.html Source] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626094728/http://demo.istat.it/pop2016/index.html |date=2017-06-26 }}:  [[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|Istat]] 2016</ref> making it the [[List of cities in Italy|most populated Italian city]] that is not a provincial capital.

==History==
In 5th-4th century BCE the territory of Giugliano was settled by the [[Osci]], who founded, among the many cities, [[Atella]] and [[Liternum]], both of them flourished under the [[Ancient Rome|dominion of Rome]]. The area is that known as [[Terra di Lavoro]], which was the most fertile part of [[Campania felix]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Canale ViaggiArt - ANSA.it - Homepage|url=http://www.ansa.it/canale_viaggiart/|access-date=2022-01-17|website=ANSA.it|language=it}}</ref>

Near "[[Lago di Patria|Lake Patria]]", there was the ancient city of [[Liternum]]. In 194 BC it became a [[Roman colony]]. The town is mainly famous as the residence of the [[Scipio Africanus|elder Scipio Africanus]], who withdrew from Rome and died there.<ref>{{cite book |last=AA. |first=VV. |title=A new guide of Naples, its environs, Procida, Ischia and Capri |date=1826 |page=384 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4R4TAAAAQAAJ}}</ref> His tomb and villa are described by [[Seneca the Younger]].<ref>Seneca, Epistulae Morales 86</ref><ref>Livy 48.52</ref> In 455, the town was pillaged and destroyed by [[Genseric]] and his [[Vandals]].<ref>{{cite book |last=AA. |first=VV. |title=A new guide of Naples, its environs, Procida, Ischia and Capri |date=1826 |page=386 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4R4TAAAAQAAJ}}</ref> The surviving population migrated to the present historical center of Giugliano.

The city remained a small center until 1207, when Cuma was destroyed by the [[Naples|Neapolitans]]; some of the citizens from that town, including the clergy and the cathedral capitular, took shelter in Giugliano. The first documents mentioning a fief in Giugliano dates from 1270.

In 1495 [[Charles VIII of France]], having occupied the [[Kingdom of Naples]], gave the feud to Count [[Michel Riccio|Michele Riccio]], from whom it was taken away with the defeat of the French.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Castellammare di Stabia (STABIANA). F. Alvino, Viaggio da Napoli a Castellammare<!-- Titolo generato automaticamente --> |url=http://www.stabiana.it/alvinocast.htm}}</ref>

Carbones in 1536 and then Carafas in 1542 sold their shares to [[Cosimo Pinelli]], whose family administered Giugliano correctly for about a century. Cosimo, with his influence, obtained the concession of the jurisdiction which administratively freed the fief of Giugliano from Aversa's interference. In 1545 he had the ducal palace built there, at the time the center of power. In this period there was a notable boost to the economy and to the cultural and social growth of the Giugliano [[university]], leaving various artistic testimonies. In 1639 Galeazzo [[Pinelli]] sold the shares due to Cesare [[D'Aquino]]. The period of the lordship of the D'Aquinos created chaos and discontent among the population, who asked the viceroy for help for the abuses suffered.<ref>{{Cite book |url= |title=Giugliano: storia, tradizioni e immagini |publisher= |location=Napoli |page=45}}</ref> In 1647, [[Henry I, Duke of Guise]] descended into Italy with his army, with claims to the crown of Naples, and set up his camp in Giugliano with about 5,000 soldiers.<ref>{{Cite web |title=I Giuglianesi ed Enrico II di Guisa |url=http://www.historiaregni.it/i-giuglianesi-ed-enrico-ii-di-guisa/}}</ref>

During the seventeenth century the [[Mancini family]] was invested, probably for a short time, with the barony of Giugliano with Domenico Nicola II, former Marquis of Fusignano and Vice Grand Chancellor of the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. In 1691 the feud passed to Francesco Grillo who acquired the title of "Duke of Giugliano". With the death of Duke Domenico Grillo, without children, it was devolved to the Royal Court.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MahcKt-Xw98C |title=Dizionario geografico ragionato del Regno di Napoli, Tomo V |location=Napoli |page=96}} {{NoISBN}}</ref>

The Viceroy and Prince of Stigliano, [[Marcantonio Colonna]], bought it in 1778 and held it until the [[French Revolution]]. With the French decade of [[Joseph Bonaparte]], the subversive laws of feudalism were enacted decreeing the end of all feudal privileges in the Kingdom of Naples and the beginning of the municipal administration. Therefore the last to govern the Giuglianese feud was the [[Colonna family|Colonna]] dynasty, after which power passed into the hands of the citizens. Lords of the city were, in sequence, the Vulcano, Filomarino, [[House of Pignatelli|Pignatelli]], [[D'Aquino]], Pinelli and [[Colonna family|Colonna]].

After the [[unification of Italy]], in 1863, the specific ''"In Campania"'' <ref>Regio Decreto n° 1140 del 22 gennaio 1863</ref> was added to the name ''"Giugliano"'' to distinguish it from the homonyms then existing.

==Geography==
It is located in a fertile coastal plain north-west of Naples, the so-called [[Agro giuglianese]], thus serving as a market for agricultural products to the city. The plain on which it sits was known in ancient Roman times as the Campania Felix, the only relief being Monte San Severino.

The altitude difference is between a few meters above [[sea level]] in the maritime area and 97 m above sea level in the historic centre. The coastal stretch, low and sandy, extends on the ''Domitian coast'' for over 3&nbsp;km, from Marina di [[Varcaturo]] to Lido di [[Licola, Pozzuoli|Licola]]. Within the territory is Lago Patria, with the locality of the same name on its banks. The lake is not of volcanic origin, but residual behind the dunes, i.e. generated by the closure of sand dunes towards the sea.<ref>Adriana Giarrizzo, Risultati di alcune ricerche sul Lago di Patria, in "Bollettino Soc. Geografica Italiana", 1952, pp.136-144</ref><ref>Domenico Ruocco, Campania, Coll. "Le Regioni d'Italia", Torino, UTET, 1976, pp. 146-149</ref>
