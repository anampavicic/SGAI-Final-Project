Because of its natural strategic position on a small peninsula into the [[Mediterranean Sea]] below the [[Taurus Mountains]], Alanya has been a local stronghold for many [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean-based empires]], including the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]], [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], and [[Ottoman Empire]]s. Alanya's greatest political importance came in the [[Middle Ages]], with the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm]] under the rule of [[Kayqubad I|Alaeddin Kayqubad I]], from whom the city derives its name. His building campaign resulted in many of the city's landmarks, such as the [[Kızıl Kule]] (Red Tower), Tersane (Shipyard), and [[Alanya Castle]].

The [[Mediterranean climate]], natural attractions, and historic heritage make Alanya a popular destination for tourism, and responsible for nine percent of [[Tourism in Turkey|Turkey's tourism sector]] and thirty percent of [[foreign purchases of real estate in Turkey]]. Tourism has risen since 1958 to become the dominant industry in the city, resulting in a corresponding increase in city population. Warm-weather sporting events and cultural festivals take place annually in Alanya. In 2014 [[List of mayors of Alanya|Mayor]] Adem Murat Yücel, of the [[Nationalist Movement Party]] unseated Hasan Sipahioğlu, of the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]], who had previously led the city since 1999. Adem Murat Yücel has served two terms as the Mayor of Alanya, first elected in 2014 and then elected for a second time in 2019. In [[2024 Turkish local elections|March 31st 2024 Turkish local elections]] Osman Tarık Özçelik of the [[Republican People's Party]] has been elected as the new Mayor of Alanya, making an historic mark as the [[Republican People's Party]] was able to win an election in the city after 74 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://haberglobal.com.tr/gundem/chp-alanyada-74-yil-sonra-kazandi-331586|title= CHP, Alanya'da 74 yıl sonra kazandı}}</ref>

==Names==

The city has changed hands many times over the centuries, and its name has reflected this. Alanya was known in [[Latin]] as ''Coracesium'' or in [[Koine Greek|Greek]] as ''Korakesion'' ({{langx|grc|Κορακήσιον}}) from the [[Luwian language|Luwian]] ''Korakassa'' meaning "point/protruding city".<ref name="Korekesion"/> The [[Roman Catholic Church]] still recognizes the Latin name as a [[titular see]] in its hierarchy.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/d4c02.html |work= Catholic Hierarchy |title= Coracesium |date= October 7, 2013 |access-date= January 18, 2015}}</ref> Under the [[Byzantine Empire]] it became known as ''Kalonoros'' or ''Kalon Oros'', meaning "beautiful/fine mountain" in [[Greek language|Greek]].<ref name="crane"/> The [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuks]] renamed the city ''[[Alaiye]]'' (علائیه), a derivative of the [[Sultan]] [[Kayqubad I|Alaeddin Kayqubad I]]'s name.

With the spread of [[Christianity]] Coracesium, as it was called, became a [[bishopric]]. Its [[bishop]] Theodulus took part in the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381, Matidianus in the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431, Obrimus in the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, and Nicephorus (Nicetas) in the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] in 680. Coracesium was a [[suffragan]] of the [[metropolitan see]] of Side, the capital of the [[Roman province]] of [[Pamphylia Prima]], to which Coracesium belonged. It continued to be mentioned in the ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]'' as late as the 12th or 13th century.<ref>Pius Bonifacius Gams, [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=65154&dirids=1 ''Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae''], Leipzig 1931, p.&nbsp;450</ref><ref>Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0agp0mJFG_sC ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. I, coll. 1007-1008</ref><ref>Raymond Janin, v.

[[File:Tip of the Alanya peninsula.jpg|thumb|left|Tip of the Alanya Peninsula|alt=Blue-green sea surrounds a rocky peninsula covered by green trees and a stone castle wall with crenelations.]]
The town is divided east–west by a rocky [[peninsula]], which is the distinctive feature of the city. The harbor, city center, and Keykubat Beach, named after the Sultan [[Kayqubad I]], are on the east side of the peninsula. Damlataş Beach, named for the famous "dripping caves", and Kleopatra Beach are to the west. The name "[[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]]" possibly derives from either the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] princess' visit here or the area's inclusion in her dowry to [[Mark Antony]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.alanya.cc/en/Beaches/92-Kleopatra-Beach.html |title= Kleopatra Beach |year= 2007 |access-date= September 7, 2008 |publisher= www.alanya.cc |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110706215021/http://www.alanya.cc/en/Beaches/92-Kleopatra-Beach.html |archive-date= 2011-07-06 }}</ref> Atatürk Bulvarı, the main boulevard, runs parallel to the sea, and divides the southern, much more touristic side of Alanya from the northern, more indigenous side that extends north into the mountains.

===Climate===
Alanya has a typical [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system|Köppen]]: ''Csa''), or a dry-summer [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''<nowiki/>'wet''' ''Cs/Cf''). Located at the [[Mediterranean Basin]], the [[subtropical high pressure zone]] ensures that most rain comes during the winter, leaving the summers long, hot, and dry, prompting the Alanya board of Tourism to use the slogan "where the sun smiles".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=133604 |title=Summer sun for southern beaches, eastern Anatolia remains icy |work=[[Today's Zaman]] |date=February 9, 2008 |access-date=February 10, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Winters, however, are mild and wet. Storm cells sometimes bring with them fair weather [[waterspout]]s when close to the shore.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherist/comment.html?entrynum=3&tstamp=200610 |title= Waterspouts in Alanya |website= Istanbul Journal of Weather |publisher= Weather Underground |date= October 19, 2006 |access-date= February 22, 2008}}</ref> The presence of the Taurus Mountain near to the sea causes fog, in turn creating visible rainbows many mornings. The height of the mountains creates an interesting effect as [[snow]] can often be seen on them even on warm days in the city below.

On the peninsula stands [[Alanya Castle]], a [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] era citadel dating from 1226. Most major landmarks in the city are found inside and around the castle. The current castle was built over existing fortifications and served the double purpose of a palace of local government and as a defensive structure in case of attack. In 2007, the city began renovating various sections of the castle area, including adapting a Byzantine church for use as a Christian community center.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://english.arsiv.yenialanya.com/index.aspx?KatAd=Alanya%20News&KatId=33&Haberim=13338 |access-date= May 2, 2009 |date= April 15, 2007 |title= Ancient Church needs support |newspaper= Orange Alanya |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718140925/http://english.arsiv.yenialanya.com/index.aspx?KatAd=Alanya%20News&KatId=33&Haberim=13338 |archive-date= July 18, 2011 }}</ref> Inside the castle is the Süleymaniye [[mosque]] and [[caravanserai]], built by [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].<ref name="hp"/> The old city walls surround much of the eastern peninsula, and can be walked.

Atatürk's House and Museum, from his short stay in the city on February 18, 1935, is preserved in its historic state and is an example of the interior of a traditional Ottoman villa, with artifacts from the 1930s.
