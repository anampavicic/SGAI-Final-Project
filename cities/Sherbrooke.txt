'''Sherbrooke''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|ɜr|b|r|ʊ|k}} {{respell|SHUR|bruuk}}, {{IPA|fr-CA|ʃɛʁˈbʁʊk|label=[[Quebec French]]:}}) is a city in southern [[Quebec]], Canada. It is at the confluence of the [[Saint-François River|Saint-François]] and [[Magog River|Magog]] rivers in the heart of the [[Estrie]] administrative region. Sherbrooke is also the name of a [[territory equivalent to a regional county municipality]] (TE) and [[Census geographic units of Canada|census division]] (CD) of [[Quebec]], coextensive with the city of Sherbrooke. With 172,950 residents at the [[Canada 2021 Census]],<ref name="cp2021a"/> it is the sixth largest city in the province and the 30th largest in Canada. The Sherbrooke [[Census Metropolitan Area]] had 227,398 inhabitants, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Quebec and 19th in Canada.

Sherbrooke is the primary economic, political, cultural, and institutional centre of Estrie, and was known as the ''Queen of the [[Eastern Townships]]'' at the beginning of the 20th century.

There are eight institutions educating 40,000 students and employing 11,000 people, 3,700 of whom are professors, teachers and researchers. The direct economic effect of these institutions exceeds one billion [[Canadian dollar|dollars]]. The proportion of university students is 10.32 students per 100 inhabitants, giving Sherbrooke the largest concentration of students in Quebec.<ref name="wpr">{{cite web |title=Sherbrooke Population 2021 |url=https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/sherbrooke-population |website=World Population Review |access-date=31 December 2021}}</ref>

Sherbrooke rose as a manufacturing centre in the 1800s, and today the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service sector]] is prominent.

The Sherbrooke region is surrounded by mountains, rivers, and lakes. There are several ski hills nearby and various tourist attractions in regional flavour. [[Mont-Bellevue Park]], a large park in the city, is used for [[downhill skiing]].

The city was named in 1818 for [[John Coape Sherbrooke]], a former [[Governor General of Canada]].<ref name="encyclo">{{cite web|title=Sherbrooke|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/fr/article/sherbrooke-2|access-date=29 December 2021|website=l'Encyclopédie Canadienne}}</ref>

==History==

[[First Nations in Canada|First Nations]] settled the region between 8,000 and 3,000 years ago.<ref name="Kesteman">Kesteman, Jean-Pierre, ''Histoire de Sherbrooke Take I: l'âge de l'eau à l'ère of vapeur (1802-1866)'', ed.

[[File:Sherbrooke en 1928.jpg|thumb|left|Sherbrooke in 1828]]
The first non-native settler was the farmer Jean-Baptiste Nolain, in 1779.<ref name="toponymie"/> The area was first surveyed in 1792.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hyatt, Gilbert|website=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio.php?id_nbr=2926|access-date=2021-12-31}}</ref> 
Americans from Vermont built mills in the area in 1802. [[Gilbert Hyatt]] led a group of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalists]], who settled around 1803. He dammed the [[Magog River]] and a [[gristmill]] and a [[sawmill]] were soon built nearby. The settlement was then known as Hyatt's Mills.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sherbrooke|url=http://www.canadiantravelguide.net/cities/SHERBROOKE/|access-date=29 December 2021|website=Canadian Travel Guide}}</ref>

In 1852 a railway linked [[Montreal]] and [[Portland, Maine]] via Sherbrooke. By the 1890s, there were rail connections to [[Boston]], [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], and [[New York City]].

[[File:Sherbrooke 1881.jpg|thumb|[[Pictorial map]] of Sherbrooke from 1881, including a list of landmarks]]

Immigration from the rest of Quebec began in 1850, and by 1871 francophones were in the majority.<ref name="destination"/>

By the turn of the 20th century, Sherbrooke was a thriving industrial city, with manufacturing benefiting from locally-produced [[hydroelectricity]]. From the 1950s, some the steel and textile industries declined, giving way to government services and education.

As part of the [[2000–2006 municipal reorganization in Quebec]], the city grew considerably on 1 January 2002, when it absorbed Ascot, Bromptonville, Deauville, Fleurimont, [[Lennoxville, Quebec|Lennoxville]], Rock Forest, and Saint-Élie-d'Orford. Part of [[Stoke, Quebec|Stoke]] was also annexed to the newly expanded Sherbrooke.

In 2012, a local biochemical factory suffered an explosion, which killed 2, and injured 19, some severely. A large toxic cloud enveloped part of the city, raising health concerns.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Macdonald|first=Roy|date=8 November 2012|title=2 killed, 19 injured in Sherbrooke Factory explosion|work=CBC News|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/2-killed-19-injured-in-sherbrooke-factory-explosion-1.1241114|access-date=17 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Pharmaceutical plant explosion injures 17, leaves cloud of toxic smoke looming over Sherbrooke|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/explosion-at-health-product-factory-injures-17-leaves-potentially-toxic-cloud-looming-over-sherbrooke|access-date=18 November 2020|website=National Post|date=8 November 2012}}</ref>
