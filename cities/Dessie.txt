'''Dessie''' ({{lang-am|ደሴ|Däse}}; also spelled '''Dese''' or '''Dessye''') is a town in north-central [[Ethiopia]]. Located in the [[South Wollo Zone]] of the [[Amhara Region]], it sits at a latitude and longitude of {{coord|11|8|N|39|38|E}}, with an elevation between 2,470 and 2,550 metres above sea level. Dessie is 400&nbsp;km to the north of the capital [[Addis Ababa]]. It has a population of more than 200,000 people in over 30 [[Wards of Ethiopia|wards]].

== History ==
=== Medieval history ===
Prior to Dessie's foundation, the major settlement in this area was Wasal, mentioned in an early 16th-century [[Italy|Italian]] itinerary.<ref>O.G.S. Crawford, ''Ethiopian Itineraries, circa 1400-1524'' (Cambridge: Hakluyt Society, 1958), pp. 50-52.</ref>

=== 19th century ===
Dessie was founded by [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Yohannes IV of Ethiopia|Yohannes IV]] who was camping in the highlands to the west of the Chefa Valley in 1882 on an expedition to forcefully convert the [[Muslim]]s who lived in the region to Christianity. As he was looking for a place to centralize his power in [[Wollo]], he stayed overnight in a pre-existing town that is now contained within Dessie. While there, he spotted a comet. He was so impressed by the sight of it that he interpreted it to be a sign from heaven to found his capital city there. A similar story to [[Zara Yaqob]]'s founding of his capital, [[Debre Birhan]]. Thus, he named it Dessie (Amharic: "My Joy"), as a reference to the elation that the comet had made him feel.<ref name="NAI-web">[http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/d/ORTDEM.pdf "Local History in Ethiopia"]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 2 February 2008)</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Pankhurst |first=Richard |year=1982 |title=History of Ethiopian towns from the mid 19th century to 1935 |page=235}}</ref>

Though founded and named by Yohannes, Dessie was beyond his dominions, for already in 1878 he recognized [[Wollo]] as being under the jurisdiction of [[Menelik II]]. Menelik's writ in the province, however, was weak and in 1888 handed its governorship to [[Mikael of Wollo|Ras Mikael]]. In 1892, Ras Mikael married the daughter of Menelik in the town, thus further integrating Wollo and [[Shewa]]. The strategic importance of Dessie became apparent during the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]], when the Emperor and his forces passed through the town on their way and from Tigray.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pankhurst |first=Richard |year=1982 |title=History of Ethiopian towns from the mid 19th century to 1935 |page=236}}</ref>

=== 20th century ===
Dessie's location led to the [[telegraph]] line constructed between 1902 and 1904 from [[Asmara]] south to Addis Ababa, passing through the city, and giving it a local telegraph office. Also in 1904, the Italian Giuseppe Bonaiuti took part in constructing a fair-weather road connecting the city to [[Addis Ababa]].<ref name="NAI-web"/>

Dessie increased in importance when [[Ras (title)|Ras]] [[Mikael of Wollo|Mikael]], son-in-law to Emperor [[Menelik II]], made it his base. The city was where his son, would-be emperor [[Iyasu V of Ethiopia|Lij Iyasus]], crowned Mikael [[negus]] around 1915. During his residence in Dessie, the Negus built a palace and the church Enda Medhane Alem. The church is decorated with paintings which include portraits of Ras Mikael and his son.<ref name=NAI-web/>

After the [[Battle of Segale|defeat]] of his father Negus Mikael, Lij Iyasu took refuge in Dessie beginning on 8 November 1916 while unsuccessfully seeking support from Ras [[Wolde Giyorgis]] and other major nobles of northern Ethiopia. However, Ras Wolde Giyorgis used these overtures to extract concessions from the central government, then marched on Dessie which Lij Iyasu fled 10 December.<ref>Harold Marcus, ''Haile Sellassie I: The Formative Years 1892-1935'' (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1996), pp. 25f</ref>

During the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italian invasion]], Dessie was first bombed 6 December 1935; the American Hospital was one of the buildings damaged in the attack. Emperor [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]] was photographed personally machine-gunning the raiding planes. The city was occupied by the Italians 15 April 1936.<ref name=NAI-web/>

Dessie became an important administrative center under the [[Italian East Africa|Italian occupation]], and the [[Franciscans]] established, in 1937, the Latin Catholic missionary [[Apostolic Prefecture of Dessié]], which would be suppressed in 1957 after its only prefect's death.

The Italian garrison of the city surrendered 26 April 1941 to Brigadier Pienaar's 1st South African Brigade and 500 Ethiopian [[arbegnoch]],<ref name=NAI-web/> and after the [[Second World War]], the town continued in importance as the capital of the province of [[Wollo]] until the province's abolition in 1995.

In a decree of 1942, Dessie is listed as one of only six "Schedule A" municipalities in Ethiopia, while there were about a hundred in "Schedule B". Artist [[Essaye Gebre-Medhin Fikre]] was born in Dessie in 1949. He gained a B.A. in Addis Ababa and an M.A. in Paris but was self-taught as an artist. In 1955, a public address system was installed in the central square which was used to re-broadcast announcements on Radio Addis Ababa to the public. In 1957, Dessie had one of 9 provincial secondary schools (excluding Eritrea) in Ethiopia, named after Woizero Sehine the daughter of Negus Mikael.<ref name=NAI-web/>

In February 1973, a crowd of 1,500 peasants marched from Dessie to the capital to make the authorities notice the famine in [[Wollo]]. They were stopped by police on the outskirts of Addis Ababa and forced to return. Following the [[Ethiopian Civil War|Ethiopian revolution]], one of the few major encounters between rebels and government forces took place north-west of Dessie in October 1976. Instigated by the local landlord, a large group of peasants marched on the city; troops of the [[Derg]] fired into the crowd. Reports of the death toll vary widely, from several hundred to nearly a thousand. The EPRDF took permanent control of the city on 18 May 1990, as part of [[Operation Wallelign]].<ref>Gebru Tareke, ''The Ethiopian Revolution: War in the Horn of Africa'' (New Haven: Yale University, 2009), p. 306</ref>

===21st century===
On 30 October 2021 it was reported that Dessie fell to [[TPLF]] aligned forces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/30/ethiopia-tigrayan-forces-seize-strategic-town-in-amhara-region|title=Ethiopia: Tigrayan forces 'seize strategic town in Amhara region'|publisher=[[Reuters]]|via=[[TheGuardian.com]]|date=30 October 2021}}</ref> On December 6, 2021, the Ethiopian government announced that Dessie and [[Kombolcha]] had been retaken from the rebel fighters.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/africa/2021/12/06/ethiopian-government-says-it-recaptured-key-towns-from-tigrayan-rebels/ |title = Ethiopian government says it recaptured key towns from Tigrayan rebels| date=6 December 2021 }}</ref>

== Economy ==
Dessie is located along [[Ethiopian Highway 2]]. It has postal service (a post office was established in the 1920s), and telephone service from at least as early as 1954. The city has had electrical power since at least 1963 when a new diesel-powered electric power station with a power line to [[Kombolcha]] was completed, at a cost of [[Ethiopian Birr|Eth$]] 110,000.<ref name="NAI-web" /> Intercity bus service is provided by the [[Selam Bus Line Share Company]]. Dessie shares [[Combolcha Airport]] ([[ICAO]] code HADC, [[IATA]] DSE) with neighbouring Kombolcha.

== Cityscape ==
Dessie is home to a [[museum]], in the former home of [[Dejazmach]] Yoseph Birru. It also has a [[Zawiya (institution)|zawiya]] of the [[Qadiriyya]] order of [[Islam]], which was the first [[Sufi]] order to be introduced into north-east Africa.<ref name="NAI-web" />

== Culture ==
Dessie is a part of the Wello region, thus having a similar style of cultural clothing, music, and dances to other cities in the former [[Wollo Province]]. Men's traditional clothing is, mostly, similar to the rest of the [[Amhara region]]'s. Women's traditional clothing includes a habesha kemis, which is a dress, as well as a matching scarf, sometimes two, one tied around the waist and the other over the hair.

==Partnerships==
Dessie cooperates with:<ref>{{cite web|title=Agreement on friendship and cooperation between the city of Ijevan of the Republic of Armenia and the city of Dessie of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia|url=https://www.mfa.am/en/bilateral-relations/et|publisher=MFA}}</ref>
