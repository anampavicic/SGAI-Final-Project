'''Darmstadt''' ({{IPA|de|ˈdaʁmʃtat|lang|De-Darmstadt.ogg}}) is a city in the [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Hesse]] in Germany, located in the southern part of the [[Frankfurt Rhine Main Area|Rhine-Main-Area (Frankfurt Metropolitan Region)]]. Darmstadt has around 160,000 inhabitants, making it the fourth largest city in the state of Hesse after [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Wiesbaden]], and [[Kassel]].

Darmstadt holds the official title "City of Science" ({{langx|de|link=no|Wissenschaftsstadt}}) as it is a major centre of scientific institutions, universities, and high-technology companies. The [[European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites]] (EUMETSAT) and the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[European Space Operations Centre]] (ESA ESOC) are located in Darmstadt, as well as [[Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung|GSI Centre for Heavy Ion Research]], where several chemical elements such as [[bohrium]] (1981), [[meitnerium]] (1982), [[hassium]] (1984), [[darmstadtium]] (1994), [[roentgenium]] (1994), and [[copernicium]] (1996) were discovered.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wanted: Suitable name for unstable, heavyweight element |newspaper=The Guardian|year=2009|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2009/jun/11/element-112-name-periodic-table|access-date=22 December 2014}}</ref> The existence of the following elements was also confirmed at [[Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung|GSI Centre for Heavy Ion Research]]: [[nihonium]] (2012), [[flerovium]] (2009), [[moscovium]] (2012), [[livermorium]] (2010), and [[tennessine]] (2012).<ref>{{cite web|title=Discovery of new elements|publisher=GSI Darmstadt|year=2016|url=https://www.gsi.de/en/researchaccelerators/research_an_overview/neue_elemente.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129211110/https://www.gsi.de/en/researchaccelerators/research_an_overview/neue_elemente.htm|archive-date=29 January 2016}}</ref> The [[Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research]] (FAIR) is an international accelerator facility under construction.

The Mathildenhöhe, including the [[Darmstadt Artists' Colony|Darmstadt artists' colony]], a major centre of the [[Jugendstil]] artistic movement, referring both to the group of artists active in the city in the late 19th and early 20th century, as well as the buildings which they designed, together with the [[Russian Chapel in Darmstadt]], was recognized as a [[World Heritage Site]] by UNESCO in 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Germany|first=hessenschau de, Frankfurt|date=24 July 2021|title=Unesco-Auszeichnung: Darmstädter Mathildenhöhe ist jetzt offiziell Welterbe|url=https://www.hessenschau.de/kultur/unesco-auszeichnung-darmstaedter-mathildenhoehe-ist-jetzt-offiziell-welterbe,mathildenhoehe-welterbe-102.html|access-date=25 July 2021|website=hessenschau.de|language=de|archive-date=24 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210724155843/https://www.hessenschau.de/kultur/unesco-auszeichnung-darmstaedter-mathildenhoehe-ist-jetzt-offiziell-welterbe,mathildenhoehe-welterbe-102.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Welterbe in Deutschland {{!}} Deutsche UNESCO-Kommission|url=https://www.unesco.de/kultur-und-natur/welterbe/welterbe-deutschland/mathildenhoehe-darmstadt|access-date=27 July 2021|website=www.unesco.de|language=de|archive-date=19 August 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240819060827/https://www.unesco.de/kultur-und-natur/welterbe/welterbe-deutschland/mathildenhoehe-darmstadt|url-status=live}}</ref>

Darmstadt was formerly the capital of a sovereign state, the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]] and its successor, the [[People's State of Hesse]], a federal state of Germany. As the capital of an increasingly prosperous [[duchy]], the city gained some international prominence and remains one of the wealthiest cities in Europe. In the 20th century, industry (especially chemicals), as well as large science and electronics (and later, information technology) sectors became increasingly important, and are still a major part of the city's economy. It is also home to the football club [[SV Darmstadt 98]]. [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)]], the wife of [[Nicholas II of Russia]], as well as [[Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse)]], the wife of [[Alexander II of Russia]], who were related, were born in this city.

=== Origins ===
The name Darmstadt first appears towards the end of the 11th century, then as ''Darmundestat''.<ref name="AKTUELLES_9">{{cite web | title=Darmstadt, Ortsname | website=AKTUELLES | url=https://www.darmstadt-stadtlexikon.de/d/darmstadt-ortsname.html | language=de | access-date=31 January 2023 | archive-date=19 August 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240819060929/https://www.darmstadt-stadtlexikon.de/d/darmstadt-ortsname.html | url-status=live }}</ref>

Darmstadt was chartered as a city by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Ludwig the Bavarian]] in 1330, at which time it belonged to the counts of [[County of Katzenelnbogen|Katzenelnbogen]].<ref name="FACTS">{{cite web | url=http://www.darmstadt.de/imperia/md/content/pdf/wirtschaft/4.pdf | title = Essential Facts (brochure from the official city website)| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319082609/http://www.darmstadt.de/imperia/md/content/pdf/wirtschaft/4.pdf | archive-date=19 March 2009 | year=2005}}</ref> The city, then called ''Darmstait'', became a secondary residence for the counts, with a small castle established at the site of the current, much larger edifice.<ref name="HISTKatz1">[http://www.graf-von-katzenelnbogen.de/burgenseitedarmstadt.html Nebenresidenz Darmstadt (darmstait)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181005073921/http://www.graf-von-katzenelnbogen.de/burgenseitedarmstadt.html |date=5 October 2018 }} (from the 'Graf v. Katzenelnbogen' website, in German. Retrieved 5 January 2008.)</ref>

When the house of Katzenelnbogen became extinct in 1479, the city was passed to the [[Landgraviate of Hesse]], and was seat of the ruling [[landgrave]]s (1567–1806) and thereafter (to 1918) of the grand dukes of [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse]].<ref name="HISTKatz2">{{Cite web|title=Die Geschichte des Grafenhauses|author=Karl.

=== Nazi Germany ===
Darmstadt was the first city in Germany to force Jewish shops to close in early 1933, shortly after the Nazis took power in Germany. The shops were only closed for one day, for "endangering communal order and tranquility".<ref>"[http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5761/lechlecha/features.htm Beginning of the End]" {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015541/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5761/lechlecha/features.htm |date=30 September 2007 }} – Musman, Moshe; from ''Borne Aloft on the Wings of a Dove'' (in-depth feature on Dei'ah veDibur website)</ref> In 1942, over 3,000 Jews from Darmstadt were first forced into a collection camp located in the Liebigschule, and later deported to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]<ref name="HIST">[http://www.darmstadt.de/kultur/geschichte/02648/ Darmstädter Stadtgeschichte 20.

{{City Centre Darmstadt Map}}
Darmstadt was the capital of an independent country (the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]) until 1871 and the capital of the German state of [[Hesse]] until 1945.<ref name="Redaktion 2021">{{cite web | title=Darmstadt im Jahr 1871: Ein Ort der Innovation | website=Echo Online | date=10 March 2021 | url=https://www.echo-online.de/lokales/darmstadt/darmstadt-im-jahr-1871-ein-ort-der-innovation-1848386 | language=de | access-date=1 February 2023 | archive-date=1 February 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230201165858/https://www.echo-online.de/lokales/darmstadt/darmstadt-im-jahr-1871-ein-ort-der-innovation-1848386 | url-status=live }}</ref> It is due to its past as a capital city that it has many architectural testimonies of this period. Many of its major architectural landmarks were created by [[Georg Moller]] who was appointed the court master builder of the Grand Duchy of Hesse.<ref name="Darmstadt_5">{{cite web | title=Georg Moller: Darmstadt | website=Darmstadt | url=https://www.darmstadt.de/leben-in-darmstadt/soziales-und-gesellschaft/kirchen/friedhoefe/ehrengraeber/georg-moller | language=de | access-date=1 February 2023 | archive-date=1 February 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230201170039/https://www.darmstadt.de/leben-in-darmstadt/soziales-und-gesellschaft/kirchen/friedhoefe/ehrengraeber/georg-moller | url-status=live }}</ref> Due to the fact that the last ruling Grand Duke of Hesse, [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse|Ernst Ludwig]] was a grandson of [[Queen Victoria]] and brother to [[Alexandra of Hesse|Empress Alexandra]] of [[Russian Empire|Russia]], the architecture of Darmstadt has been influenced by British and Russian imperial architecture with many examples still existing, such as the Luisenplatz with its grand-ducal column, the old Hessian State Theatre (at Karolinenplatz) and the Russian Chapel by [[Leon Benois]]. The Russian church, St. Mary Magdalene Chapel, is named in honor of the patron saint of Tsar Nicholas' mother and was built of Russian stone on Russian soil brought to Darmstadt by train. It was used by the Russian imperial family and court during regular visits to the Tsarina's brother and family in Darmstadt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.russianorthodoxchurch.ws/synod/engdocuments/enart_churches.html |title=The Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia – Official Website |access-date=14 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429050209/http://www.russianorthodoxchurch.ws/synod/engdocuments/enart_churches.html |archive-date=29 April 2014}}</ref> The [[Residential Palace Darmstadt]] ({{lang|de|Stadtschloss}}) is located in the city centre. It was the residence of the counts of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]], later as [[Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine|Grand Dukes of Hesse]] by the grace of Napoleon. The rulers of Hesse also owned [[Jagdschloss Kranichstein]], a hunting lodge in [[Kranichstein]] which is a nowadays used as a five star hotel. The most famous castle in the Darmstadt region is [[Frankenstein Castle]] due to claims that the real castle may have had an influence on Mary Shelley's decision to choose the name [[Frankenstein]] for her monster-creating scientist. This castle dates back to the 13th century, but it was acquired by the counts of Hesse-Darmstadt in 1662.

=== Modern architecture ===
[[File:Darmstadt-Waldspirale-Hundertwasser3.jpg|thumb|The Waldspirale]]

Darmstadt has a rich tradition in modern architecture. After 1945 several ''"Meisterbauten"'' (''Masterful Architectonic Creations'') were built that set standards for modern architecture. These buildings still exist and are used for various public and private purposes. In the late 1990s the [[Waldspirale]] ('Forest Spiral') was built, a residential complex by Austrian [[Hundertwasser|Friedensreich Hundertwasser]]. As an almost [[Surrealism|surreal]] building, it is internationally famous for its almost absolute rejection of rectangular forms, down to every window having a different shape, the style being a trademark of Hundertwasser's work. Hundertwasser died before the Waldspirale was finished.

=== Art Nouveau ===
[[File:La Mathildenhöhe, colline jugendstil (Darmstadt) (7882270018).jpg|thumb|The Mathildenhöhe]]

Darmstadt was a centre of the [[Art Nouveau|Art Nouveau movement]]. Surviving examples of the [[Jugendstil]] period include the Rosenhöhe, a landscaped English-style [[rose]] garden from the 19th century, recently renovated and replanted,<ref>[http://www.darmstadt.de/en/sights/rosenhoehe/index.html Rosenhöhe – planted with roses] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428042421/http://www.darmstadt.de/en/sights/rosenhoehe/index.html |date=28 April 2009 }} (from the official city website)</ref> the UNESCO World Heritage Site [[Mathildenhöhe]],<ref>[http://www.darmstadt.de/en/sights/mathildenhoehe/index.html Mathildenhöhe (Artists' Colony)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813221840/http://www.darmstadt.de/en/sights/mathildenhoehe/index.html |date=13 August 2009 }} (from the official city website)</ref> with the ''Hochzeitsturm'' ('Wedding tower', also commonly known as the 'Five-Finger-Tower') by [[Joseph Maria Olbrich]], the [[Russian Chapel in Darmstadt]] and large exhibition halls as well as many private villas built by Jugendstil architects who had settled in Darmstadt. German Art Nouveau is commonly known by its German name, Jugendstil. The name is taken from the artistic journal, Die Jugend, which was published in Munich and which espoused the new artistic movement. It was founded in 1896 by Georg Hirth (Hirth remained editor until his death in 1916, and the magazine continued to be published until 1940). The magazine was instrumental in promoting the style in Germany. As a result, its name was adopted as the most common German-language term for the style: Jugendstil ("young style"). Although, during the early 20th century, the word was applied to only two-dimensional examples of the graphic arts, especially the forms of organic typography and graphic design found in and influenced by German magazines like Jugend, Pan, and [[Simplicissimus]], it is now applied to more general manifestations of Art Nouveau visual arts in Germany, the Netherlands, the Baltic states, and Nordic countries. The two main centres for Jugendstil art in Germany were Munich and Darmstadt.

=== Squares ===
[[File:Luisenplatz-Rathaus.jpg|thumb|Luisenplatz with Ludwigsäule]]

The ''Luisenplatz'', the central square of the city, forms the centre of the city and is the main public transport hub. In 1844 the ''Ludwigsäule'' (called ''Langer Lui'', meaning ''Long Ludwig''), a 33-metre (108&nbsp;ft) column commemorating [[Ludwig I, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine|Ludwig I]], first Grand Duke of [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse]], was placed in the middle of the square. While the column still stands, the square is today surrounded by mostly modern buildings. Other important squares are the ''Marktplatz'' (see image) near the old city hall and the ''Sabaisplatz'' at the ''Mathildenhöhe''.

=== Parks ===
[[File:Darmstadt Eingang Rosenhöhe.jpg|thumb|Park Rosenhöhe]]

The city has a high density of parks. Among the most important parks are the English style ''Herrngarten'' in central Darmstadt. In former times it was part of the Royal Gardens used exclusively by the dukes of Darmstadt. Today it is a public park, heavily used in every season of the year. Other important parks are the French style parks ''Prinz-Georgs-Garten'' and [[Orangerie (Darmstadt)|Orangerie]], the modern style ''Bürgerpark'' ("People's Park") in northern Darmstadt and the mystical ''Park Rosenhöhe'' ("Rose Heights"), which also serves as the cemetery for the dukes and their immediate family, with two impressive mausoleum buildings (Altes Mausoleum and Neues Mausoleum) in its remote parts. The [[Botanischer Garten der TU Darmstadt|Botanischer Garten]] in eastern Darmstadt is a botanical garden maintained by the [[Technische Universität Darmstadt]] with a fine collection of rare plants and trees.

=== Churches ===

[[File:Altes Rathaus-Marktplatz-Darmstadt.jpg|thumb|Marktplatz with the old city hall and Stadtkirche Church]]
[[File:St-Ludwig Darmstadt 548-h.jpg|thumb|St. Ludwig Church]]
The [[Protestant]] [[Stadtkirche Darmstadt]] built in 1369, is in the pedestrian zone of the downtown city center, next to the historic Hotel Bockshaut.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bockshaut.de/EN/ |title=Historic hotel Bockshaut |access-date=15 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190226201227/http://www.bockshaut.de/EN/ |archive-date=26 February 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The church has [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] elements along with [[renaissance]] and [[baroque]], it houses the [[Royal family|royal]] [[crypt]]. Hotel Bockshaut was built in 1580 for a church presbytery. The most important [[Catholic]] Church is ''St. Ludwig'' in central Darmstadt. The [[Russian Chapel in Darmstadt]] is a [[Russian orthodox church]] which is still in use. It was built and used as a private chapel by the last [[Tsar]] of Russia, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], whose wife [[Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse|Alexandra]] was born in Darmstadt. Although Russian orthodox churches also exist in other cities outside Russia, the Russian Chapel in Darmstadt was the only official Russian church used by the Tsar outside the [[Russian Empire]]. It is said that the chapel was built on Russian soil that was brought to Darmstadt exclusively for the purpose of building the Tsar's private chapel on it.

=== Festivals ===
Every year on the first weekend of July the [[Heinerfest]] festival is held in the streets surrounding the old ducal palace. It is a traditional German festival with music acts, [[beer hall]]s, [[amusement ride]]s and booths selling trinkets and food. The similar {{ill|Schlossgrabenfest|de}}, which is more [[live music]]-oriented, is held in the same location every year in May. These two festivals attract 700,000<ref>{{Cite web|date=26 January 2008|title=www.darmstadt.de – Informationen, Heinerfest|url=http://www.darmstadt.de/infos/heinerfest/|access-date=7 January 2023|archive-date=26 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080126230241/http://www.darmstadt.de/infos/heinerfest/|url-status=dead}}</ref> and 400,000<ref>{{Cite web|title=Schlossgrabenfest 2006|url=https://www.schlossgrabenfest.de/2006/sgf_aktuelles_14.html|access-date=7 January 2023|website=www.schlossgrabenfest.de|archive-date=7 January 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230107153301/https://www.schlossgrabenfest.de/2006/sgf_aktuelles_14.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> visitors respectively.

Southern Hesse is well known for its mild climate which allows [[winegrowing]] on a large scale in the region south of Darmstadt. The weather is often volatile with the summers being warm and humid with frequent thunderstorms, the winters mostly relatively mild with frequent periods of [[high fog]]. Snowfall is most likely in January and February, but mild winters without considerable snowfall can occur.

Darmstadt is home to many research institutions such as the [[Fraunhofer Society]] (Fraunhofer IGD, Fraunhofer LBF, Fraunhofer SIT) and the [[Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung]] (GSI, "Society for [[heavy ion]] Research"), which operates a [[particle accelerator]] in northern Darmstadt. The GSI, amongst other elements, discovered the [[chemical element]] [[darmstadtium]] ([[atomic number]]: 110), named after the city in 2003. This makes Darmstadt one of [[List of chemical elements named after places|several cities]] with elements named after them. Various other elements, including [[meitnerium]] (atomic number: 109) (1982), [[hassium]] (atomic number: 108) (1984), [[roentgenium]] (atomic number: 111) (1994) and [[copernicium]] (atomic number: 112) (1996) were also synthesized in the Darmstadt facility.

The [[European Space Operations Centre]] (ESOC) of the [[European Space Agency]] is located in Darmstadt. From here, various deep-space exploration spacecraft and Earth-orbiting satellites are operated for the purposes of scientific research, and technology development and demonstration.

[[EUMETSAT]], the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites, operates the principal European [[meteorological]] [[satellite]]s from its headquarters, including the first and second generations of [[Meteosat]] geostationary satellites, and the polar-orbiting [[Metop]] series.

Darmstadt is a centre for the pharmaceutical and chemical industry, with Merck, Röhm and [[Carl Schenck|Schenck RoTec]] (part of The Dürr Group) having their main plants and centres here.

Darmstadt is also a centre for the IT and telecommunications industry, with companies like [[Software AG]], [[T-Systems]] (laboratories in Darmstadt) and [[Deutsche Telekom]] (laboratories in Darmstadt).

===United States military presence===
U.S. forces entered the city of Darmstadt on 25 March 1945. At the end of World War II, Darmstadt was among the 112 communities where U.S. forces were stationed. Early units stationed here included elements of the U.S. Constabulary, Air Force units and a Quartermaster School.

Over the years, the U.S. military community Darmstadt – under a variety of designations such as the 440th Signal Battalion, served as home for thousands of American soldiers and their families. It included six principal installations in Darmstadt and nearby [[Babenhausen, Hesse|Babenhausen]], [[Griesheim, Hesse|Griesheim]] and [[Münster, Hesse|Münster]], plus several housing areas, an airfield and a large number of smaller facilities as far away as [[Bensheim]] and [[Aschaffenburg]]. The military newspaper European ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' also had its headquarters there. As of 1993, the Darmstadt military community also assumed responsibility for the remaining U.S. Army facilities in the [[Frankfurt-am-Main|Frankfurt]] area.

As part of the U.S. Army's ongoing transformation in Germany, the Darmstadt military community, by then designated [[U.S. Army Garrison Darmstadt]], inactivated on 30 September 2008. Even after the garrison inactivation, however, there is still one unit active in Darmstadt: The [[66th Military Intelligence Brigade (United States)|66th Military Intelligence Group]] at the [[Dagger Complex]] on Eberstädter Weg.<ref>{{coord|49.843786|8.584211}}</ref> It draws its support from the nearby U.S. Army Garrison Wiesbaden. The U.S. Army Garrison Wiesbaden's website mentions the unit still being active in Darmstadt, and a Marine Corps company being stationed there as well. With the exception of Dagger Complex, all remaining US installations are now empty and closed to the public, pending property disposal by the German authorities.
