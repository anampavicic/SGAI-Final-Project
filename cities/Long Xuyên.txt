'''Long Xuyên''' ({{IPA|vi|lāwŋm sʷīən|lang|Long Xuyen.ogg}}), formally named '''Thủ Đông Xuyên''', is the capital city of [[An Giang province]], in the [[Mekong Delta]] region of south-western [[Vietnam]].

==History==
[[File:NamKy1863.jpg|thumb|1863 map of Long Xuyen|left]]
In 1789, a group of explorers established a small outpost in the Tam Khe canal, naming it Dong Xuyen.  Soon after, a marketplace was created and named Long Xuyên, but by the 1860s the area became better known for the Long Xuyen market than by the official outpost's name. From 1877, the reach of Long Xuyên grew as the city's administration became responsible for an increasing number of neighborhoods and wards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://baoangiang.com.vn/230-nam-tu-thu-dong-xuyen-den-tp-long-xuyen-a241716.html|title = 230 năm từ thủ Đông Xuyên đến TP. Long Xuyên}}</ref> Long Xuyen would not be designated as a formal city until 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Bat-dong-san/Nghi-dinh-09-1999-ND-CP-thanh-lap-thanh-pho-Long-Xuyen-thuoc-tinh-An-Giang-45089.aspx|title = Nghị định 09/1999/NĐ-CP thành lập thành phố Long Xuyên, thuộc tỉnh an Giang}}</ref>

==Geography==
It is located approximately 1,950&nbsp;km south of [[Hanoi]], 189&nbsp;km from [[Ho Chi Minh City]], and 45&nbsp;km from the [[Cambodia]]n border. The population of Long Xuyên city is over 368,376 (2013), with an area of approximately 106.87&nbsp;km².

The city is subdivided to 13 [[Commune-level subdivisions (Vietnam)|commune-level subdivisions]], including the [[Ward (Vietnam)|wards]] of: [[Mỹ Bình, An Giang|Mỹ Bình]], [[Mỹ Long, An Giang|Mỹ Long]], [[Mỹ Xuyên, An Giang|Mỹ Xuyên]], [[Bình Khánh, An Giang|Bình Khánh]], [[Mỹ Phước, An Giang|Mỹ Phước]], [[Đông Xuyên, An Giang|Đông Xuyên]], [[Mỹ Quý, An Giang|Mỹ Quý]], [[Mỹ Thạnh, An Giang|Mỹ Thạnh]], [[Mỹ Thới]], [[Bình Đức, An Giang|Bình Đức]], [[Mỹ Hòa, An Giang|Mỹ Hòa]] and the [[Commune (Vietnam)|rural communes]] of [[Mỹ Hòa Hưng]] and [[Mỹ Khánh, An Giang|Mỹ Khánh]].

==Economy==
[[File:Chợ Long Xuyên bên sông Hậu.jpg|thumb|Long Xuyen Marketplace next to the Hau River|left]]
As a major urban hub within the rural Mekong River Delta region, Long Xuyen is adjacent to major agricultural operations.  With a major docking station in the middle of the city and rivers cutting throughout its landscape, the city connects the residents of the provinces of An Giang, Dong Thap, and Kien Giang province to the region's land-based infrastructure.

With farms in towns surrounding the city connected by roads and canals, Long Xuyen (and its Quadrilateral Region) serves as a major conduit for producers of a number of commodities, with [[jasmine rice]] and [[basa fish]] being the two most well-known.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tuoitrenews.vn/news/features/20210206/mekong-delta-a-35year-miracle-change-of-vietnams-rice-bowl/59135.html|title = Mekong Delta: A 35-year miracle change of Vietnam's rice bowl|date = 6 February 2021}}</ref> The proliferation of irrigation canals in the city has provided a major boon to the region's economy, but also poses a threat to environmental protection and community safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unpo.org/members/7887|title=UNPO: Khmer-Krom}}</ref>

==Education==
Long Xuyên is home to [[An Giang University]] and the Long Xuyên Teacher's Training College. [[An Giang University]] is the second largest university in the [[Mekong Delta]] with over 10,000 students enrolled in 2021.

There are three main high schools in Long Xuyên city: [[Thoại Ngọc Hầu]], Bình Khánh and Long Xuyên. Thoại Ngọc Hầu high school was once known as Long Xuyên high school, with currently over 2,000&nbsp;students. Thoại Ngọc Hầu is a specialized school for majors of English, Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics, Literature, and Biology.

== Culture ==
As Long Xuyen was designated as a city until 1999,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Bat-dong-san/Nghi-dinh-09-1999-ND-CP-thanh-lap-thanh-pho-Long-Xuyen-thuoc-tinh-An-Giang-45089.aspx|title = Nghị định 09/1999/NĐ-CP thành lập thành phố Long Xuyên, thuộc tỉnh an Giang}}</ref> many of its residents have moved from surrounding rural towns.  [[Floating markets of Vietnam|The Long Xuyen Floating Market]] is an aspect of the more traditional life that remains from more rural times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.culturemagazin.com/three-southwestern-floating-markets-an-unforgettable-experience/|title = Three Southwestern Floating Markets: An Unforgettable Experience!|date = 31 August 2020}}</ref>

With its close proximity to Cambodia, the city has a significant number of Khmer residents.

===Religion===
[[File:Thánh thất Cao Đài Long Xuyên.jpg|thumb|left|Long Xuyen Cao Dai temple]]
[[File:Nhà thờ chính tòa thành phố Long Xuyên.jpg|thumb|right|Nhà_thờ chính tòa thành_phố Long Xuyên]]
Long Xuyên has a rich religious make-up.  It is founding place of the [[Hòa Hảo]] Buddhist sect. There are also many Catholic churches and communities, with the Long Xuyen Diocese celebrating its 60th anniversary with 230,000 members in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucanews.com/news/vietnam-catholics-urged-to-do-evangelization-via-rosaries/89711|title = Vietnam Catholics urged to do evangelization via rosaries - UCA News}}</ref> It is one of few cities with a [[Cao Dai]] temple.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vietnamsite.nl/longxuyencaodaieng.htm|title=Cao Dai Temple - Long Xuyen}}</ref>

Former president [[Tôn Đức Thắng]]'s birthday is celebrated in Mỹ Hòa Hưng (Tiger Island).

===Cuisine===
With its proximity to Cambodian border to the north, the coastline of the Indian Ocean to the west, and the Mekong River dissecting surrounding towns, the cuisine of Long Xuyen is heavily influenced by both local goods as well as products passing through.  More locally,   [[basa fish]], mắm thái, and ''thot not'' coconuts are considered locally produced ingredients. ''Bun Ca Long Xuyen'' is a distinct specialty to the city that can be found by street vendors, who make a broth with [[Snakehead (fish)|snakehead]] fish and tamarind to eat with rice noodles and herbs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegioiamthuc.com/bun-ca-long-xuyen/|title = Bún cá Long Xuyên món ngon không thể chối từ|date = 29 September 2017}}</ref>
