==Name==
[[File:天津中央商务区8.jpg|thumb|left|CBD in Tianjin]]
''Tianjin'' is the [[pinyin]] spelling of the [[Chinese characters]] {{lang|zh|天津}}. The name literally means 'the port of the emperor'. The origin of the name is disputed. One traditional theory says that it was an homage to the [[state of Chu|Chu]] [[Chinese poetry|poet]] [[Qu Yuan]], whose "[[Li Sao]]" includes the verse "... departing from the Ford of Heaven at dawn ..." ({{zhi|t=朝發軔於天津兮|p=zhāo fārèn yú Tiānjīn xī}}). Another says that it honors the former name of the [[Girl (Chinese constellation)|Girl]], a [[Chinese constellations|Chinese constellation]] recorded under the name ''Tianjin'' in the Astronomical Record section of the [[Book of Sui]]. A third says that it derives from a place name noted in the River Record of the History of [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin]]. The most common theory says that it was bestowed by the [[Yongle Emperor]] of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]], who crossed Tianjin's [[Hai River|Gu River]] on his way south to overthrow his nephew, the [[Jianwen Emperor]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |date=23 May 2020 |title=10 Interesting Facts About Tianjin |url=https://thebiggestcitiesinchina.com/10-interesting-facts-about-tianjin/ |access-date=25 February 2024 |website=Biggest Cities in China}}</ref>

Prior to the introduction of pinyin, the city's name was historically romanized as {{transliteration|zh|Tientsin}} in the [[Chinese postal romanization]]. The current English spelling of Tianjin was adopted in 1958, after pinyin was introduced by the PRC government. Several countries, international organizations and media outlets have adopted the pinyin name since in 1979. The [[Government of the Republic of China|Government of the Republic of China (ROC)]] has continued to use the postal and Wade–Giles spelling since the adoption of pinyin by the ROC government in 2009.

==History==

=== Early history ===
The land where Tianjin is now located was created in between 900 and 1300 CE by the sediments of rivers entering the sea at the [[Bohai Gulf]], including the Yellow River, which entered the open sea in the area at one time. The construction of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] under the [[Sui dynasty]] helped the future development of Tianjin, as the canal ran from [[Hangzhou]] to the [[Beijing]] and Tianjin region by 609 CE. Grain from southern China was regularly transported to the north through the canal and was used during the subsequent dynasties. Tianjin began to be increasingly mentioned in records during the [[Song dynasty]] and gained importance during the [[Yuan dynasty]]. Tianjin experienced development under the Yuan and became a location for the storage of goods and grains. Tianjin became a garrison town and shipping station during the [[Ming dynasty]]; it was a center of commerce by the 17th century.<ref>{{Cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|year=1996|isbn=1-884964-04-4|editor-last=Schellinger|editor-first=Paul|location=Chicago|pages=813|editor-last2=Salkin|editor-first2=Robert}}</ref>

===Qing dynasty===

During the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644{{ndash}}1911), the Tianjin [[Zhou (country subdivision)|Prefecture]], or ''Zhou'' ({{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|州}}}}), was established in 1725, and Tianjin County was established within the prefecture in 1731. Later, it became an [[Fu (administrative division)|urban prefecture]] or ''Fu'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|府}}}}), before becoming a relay station ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|駐|地}}}}) under the command of the [[Viceroy of Zhili]].

===Opening up as a treaty port===
{{See also|Concessions in Tianjin}}
In 1856, Chinese soldiers boarded ''The Arrow'', a Chinese-owned ship registered in Hong Kong that flew the British flag and which was suspected of piracy, smuggling, and involvement in the opium trade. The soldiers captured twelve men and imprisoned them. In response, the British and French sent gunboats under the command of [[Michael Seymour (Royal Navy officer)|Admiral Sir Michael Seymour]] to capture the [[Taku forts]] near Tianjin in May 1858. At the end of the first part of the [[Second Opium War]] in June of the same year, the British and French prevailed, and the [[Treaty of Tientsin]] was signed, which opened Tianjin (Tientsin) to foreign trade. The treaties were ratified by the [[Xianfeng Emperor]] in 1860, so Tianjin was formally opened to Great Britain and France and thus to the outside world. Between 1895 and 1900, Britain and France were joined by Japan, Germany and [[Russia]], and some countries without Chinese [[concession (territory)|concessions]], such as [[Austria-Hungary]], Italy and [[Belgium]], in establishing self-contained [[concessions in Tianjin]], each with its own prisons, schools, barracks and hospitals.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0018246X15000461|title=Italy's Informal Imperialism in Tianjin During the Liberal Epoch, 1902–1922|journal=The Historical Journal|volume=59|issue=2|pages=447–468|date=June 2016|last1=Donati|first1=Sabina|s2cid=163536150}}</ref> These nations left architectural reminders of their rule, which include churches and thousands of villas.

[[File:望海楼教堂.jpg|thumb|right|Church of Our Lady's Victories, built in 1869, was the site of the [[Tientsin massacre|Tianjin Church Massacre]].]]
The presence of foreign influence in Tianjin was not always peaceful; one violent incident was that of the [[Tientsin massacre|Tianjin Church Massacre]]. In June 1870, the orphanage held by the Wanghailou Church (translated as Church Our Lady's Victories{{Citation needed|date=January 2024}}) in Tianjin, which built by French [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tianjin|Roman Catholic missionaries]], was accused of kidnapping and brainwashing Chinese children. On June 21, the [[magistrate]] of Tianjin County initiated a conflict at the church that developed into violent clashes between the church's Christian supporters and some non-Christian Tianjin residents. The protesters eventually burned down Wanghailou Church and the nearby French consulate, killing eighteen foreigners, including ten French nuns, the French consul, and merchants. France and six other Western nations complained to the Qing government, which was forced to pay compensation for the incident.

In June 1900, the [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxers]] were able to seize control of parts of Tianjin. On June 26, European defense forces heading towards Beijing were stopped by Boxers at nearby [[Langfang]]; they were defeated and forced to turn back to Tianjin. The foreign concessions were also under siege for several weeks.

In July 1900, the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] [[Battle of Tientsin|recaptured Tianjin]]. This alliance soon established the Tianjin Provisional Government, which was composed of representatives from each of the occupying forces (Russia, Britain, Japan, Germany, France, America, Austro-Hungary, and Italy). The city was governed by this council until August 15, 1902, when the city was returned to Qing control. Qing General [[Yuan Shikai]] led efforts to transform Tianjin into a modern city, establishing the first modern Chinese police force. In 1907, Yuan supervised China's first modern democratic elections for a county council.

[[Western world|Western nations]] were permitted to garrison the area to ensure open access to Beijing. The British maintained a brigade of two battalions in Tianjin, and the Italians, French, Japanese, Germans, Russians, and Austro-Hungarians maintained their forces using strength regiments; the United States did not initially participate. During [[World War I]], the German and Austro-Hungarian garrisons were captured as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] by [[Allies of World War I|Allied Forces]]; meanwhile, in 1918, the Bolshevik government withdrew the Russian garrison. In 1920, the remaining participating nations asked the United States to join them, and the US then sent the [[15th Infantry Regiment (United States)|15th Infantry Regiment]], minus one battalion, to Tianjin from the Philippines.

Because of the development of industry, commerce and finance in the city, Tianjin was established as a [[Direct-administered municipalities of China|municipality]] of China in 1927. From 1930 to 1935, Tianjin was the provincial capital of [[Hebei]]; afterwards, it was reestablished as an independent municipality.

Garrison duty was highly regarded by the troops. General [[George Marshall|George C. Marshall]], the "architect of victory" in World War II, during which he was the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]], served in Tianjin in the 1920s as the Executive Officer of the 15th Infantry. The US withdrew the infantry unit in 1938, but the nation's presence was maintained by the dispatch of a small US Marine Corps unit from the Embassy Guard at Beijing.

===Second Sino-Japanese War===
On July 30, 1937, during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Tianjin fell to Japan, but was not entirely occupied, as the Japanese generally respected [[Concessions in Tianjin|foreign concessions]] until 1941, when [[Concessions in Tianjin|American and British concessions]] were occupied. In the summer of 1939, the [[Tientsin Incident]] damaged Anglo-Japanese relations. On June 14, 1939, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] surrounded and blockaded a British concession due to the refusal of British authorities to transfer six Chinese people, who had assassinated a Japanese collaborator and taken refuge in the British concession, to be under Japan's authority. For a time, the events of 1939 appeared likely to cause an Anglo-Japanese war, especially when reports of the Japanese Army mistreating British subjects wishing to leave or enter the concession appeared in British newspapers. The situation ended when British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] was advised by the [[Royal Navy]] and the Foreign Office that the only way to force the Japanese to lift the blockade was to send the main British battle fleet to Far Eastern waters, and that given the situation in Europe, it would be inappropriate to send the British fleet out of European waters, thus leading the British to finally turn over the six Chinese people, who were then executed by the Japanese. During the Japanese occupation, Tianjin was ruled by the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1937–1940)|North China Executive Committee]], a [[puppet state]] based in Beijing.

On August 9, 1940, all of the British troops in Tianjin were ordered to withdraw. On November 14, 1941, the American [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] unit stationed in Tianjin was ordered to leave, but before it left, the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked the United States]]. The American Marine detachment surrendered to the Japanese on December 8, 1941. Only the Italian and French concessions (the local French officials were loyal to [[Vichy France|Vichy]]) were allowed by the Japanese to remain. When Italy signed an [[Armistice of Cassibile|armistice]] with the Allies in September 1943, Japanese troops took the Italian concession, following a battle with its garrison, and the [[Italian Social Republic]] formally ceded the concession to [[Wang Jingwei]]'s Japan-controlled [[Reorganized National Government of China|puppet state]]. Japanese occupation of the city lasted until August 15, 1945, with the surrender of Japan marking the end of World War II.

===After World War II===
[[File:China 10th Anniversary Parade in Tianjin.jpg|thumb|P.R.China's 10th anniversary parade in Tianjin in 1959]]
In the [[Pingjin Campaign]] of the Chinese Civil War, the city was captured after 29 hours of fighting. The [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) took Tianjin on January 15, 1949.

From 1949 to February 1958, Tianjin was a municipality directly under the control of the central government. In October 1952, [[Tianjin Port|Tanggu New Port]] officially opened its doors, and the first 10,000-ton ferry arrived at Newport Pier. In February 1958, due to the "Great Leap Forward" and the city's industrial foundation, Tianjin was incorporated into [[Hebei|Hebei Province]], the capital of which was relocated to Tianjin for eight years. During the period, under the coordination of the State Council, the city of Tianjin implemented a separate policy for central planning, which was independent of Hebei Province. However, a number of factories and colleges in Tianjin moved to Hebei, hindering Tianjin's economic development. In January 1967, due to preparation and concerns that Tianjin would become a battlefield, Hebei Province repatriated its provincial capital to Baoding, and the [[Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party|CCP Central Committee]] decided that Tianjin should be restored to the central municipality and remain so. In April 1970, since the central government had applied for funding for the construction of the subway, the Tianjin Municipal Government decided to raise funds on its own to establish the project using the name of the channel and by build it on the basis of the old walled river. In July 1973, five counties, including Jixian, Baodi, Wuqing, Jinghai, and Ninghe, were formally placed under the jurisdiction of Tianjin.
[[File:炫彩津门11Tianjin Eye and Haihe River.jpg|thumb|left|Luanhe hydraulic engineering monument and [[Tianjin Eye]]]]

On July 28, 1976, during the 7.6 magnitude [[1976 Tangshan earthquake|Tangshan Earthquake]], Tianjin was affected by shock waves and experienced a loss of life. In the city, 24,345 people died and 21,497 were seriously injured. 60% of the city's buildings were destroyed and more than 30% of the enterprises and Peking Port Reservoir and Yuqiao Reservoir were seriously damaged. Nearly 700,000 people were left homeless. On October 10 of the same year, the Tianjin Underground Railway was opened to traffic. In 1981, Miyun Reservoir was built on the upper reaches of the Hai River; it is now used to supply water for Beijing; however; the reservoir stopped the river from supplying water to Tianjin, resulting in difficulty with water usage in the city. As a result, during 1976, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]] decided to initiate a project to solve the problem of water usage in Tianjin by attracting individuals to the city's academic centers.

[[File:邓小平题开发区大有希望的天津泰达垦荒犁.jpg|thumb|Monument of TEDA]]
In 1984, during the beginning of the Chinese government's economic reforms, Tianjin was listed as one of the 14 coastal open cities by the State Council and the [[Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area|Tianjin Development Zone]]'s economy began to develop. However, the overall speed of development in Tianjin is still slower than that of [[special economic zone]]s and that of other southeast coastal areas. In 1994, Tianjin began its industrial shift towards the east and developed the [[Binhai|Binhai New Area]], with the [[Port of Tianjin|Tianjin Port]] as its core. In October 2005, the [[16th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party|Fifth Plenary Session of the 16th CCP Central Committee]] convened; its meeting decided to incorporate the development and opening of the [[Binhai New Area]] into its [[Eleventh five-year plan (China)|Eleventh Five-Year Plan]] and the national development strategy. In March 2006, the State Council executive meeting positioned Tianjin as an "international port city, a northern economic center, and an ecological city." Since then, the dispute between the Beijing-Tianjin economic center at the policy level has come to an end. In May 2006, the State Council approved the Binhai New Area as a national integrated reform pilot area. In June of the same year, the State Council's Opinions on Promoting the Development and Opening of the Tianjin Binhai New Area were announced; they stated the following: "In financial enterprises, financial services, financial markets, and finance Major reforms such as opening up can, in principle, be scheduled to precede the Tianjin Binhai New Area."

In August 2008, China's first [[high-speed railway]], the [[Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway]], which has a speed of 350 kilometers per hour, was opened. In August 2008, Tianjin was the co-host city of the [[2008 Summer Olympics|29th Olympic Games]]. In September 2008, the Annual Meeting of the New Champions of [[World Economic Forum]] (also called [[Summer Davos]]) began to be established in Tianjin; it is now held every two years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/business/222969.htm |title=World Economic Forum: The Inaugural Annual Meeting of the New Champions |publisher=China.org |access-date=August 29, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923232350/http://www.china.org.cn/english/business/222969.htm |archive-date=September 23, 2015 |url-status=live  }}</ref> In October 2010, the UN Climate Change Conference convened in Tianjin.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/10/04/china.climate.talks/index.html?hpt=T2 |title=Global climate talks kick off in China |publisher=CNN |access-date=March 15, 2011 |date=October 4, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108184048/http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/10/04/china.climate.talks/index.html?hpt=T2 |archive-date=November 8, 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref> In 2012, the [[Tianjin Metro]] Lines 2, 3, and 9 were completed and open to traffic, and Tianjin Rail Transit was formally networked.

In October 2013, Tianjin hosted an international comprehensive event for the first time by hosting the [[East Asian Games]]. In 2014, the coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei was officially incorporated into the national strategy; Tianjin was positioned as the National Advanced Manufacturing R&D Base, Northern International Shipping Core Area, Financial Innovation Operation Demonstration Area, and Reform and Opening-up Preceding Area. In the same year, the first phase of the [[South–North Water Transfer Project|South-to-North Water Transfer Project]] was completed, so water availability in Tianjin increased. On February 26, 2015, the Tianjin National Independent Innovation Demonstration Zone was formally established. On April 21, the China (Tianjin) Free Trade Pilot Zone was also formally established. On April 27, [[Jincheng Group|Jincheng Bank]], the first private bank in northern China, officially opened its doors.

====2015 Tianjin explosion====
On August 12, 2015, a [[2015 Tianjin explosions|fire and explosion]] occurred in a [[chemical]] warehouse in [[Tianjin Port]], causing 173 deaths, hundreds of injuries, and property losses.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-33896292|title=China blasts: Casualties as Tianjin warehouse blows up|work=BBC News|date=August 13, 2015|access-date=June 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718135259/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-33896292|archive-date=July 18, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The first two explosions at the facility, which is located in the [[Binhai|Binhai New Area]] of Tianjin, happened within 30 seconds of each other; the second explosion was larger and involved the detonation of approximately 800 tons of ammonium nitrate (equivalent to about 256 tons of [[TNT]]). Fires caused by the initial explosions continued to burn uncontrollably throughout the weekend, resulting in eight additional explosions on August 15. The buildings of seven more surrounding logistics companies were destroyed. The cost to businesses caused by the explosion was estimated to be $9 billion, making it the most expensive supply chain disruption of 2015.

In 1912, Tianjin had 17 Chinese-language newspapers and five daily newspapers in other languages. None of the newspapers in the Tianjin district were trade papers. Of the foreign language newspapers, three were in English; the other two were in French and German, respectively.

===Censorship capital===
China's leading Internet information providers (which are usually located in Beijing), including social networks [[Sina Weibo]] and [[Douban]], as well as the online video website [[Sohu]], have been increasingly relocating their censorship departments to Tianjin, where labor costs are cheaper than in Beijing, as censorship is a type of [[labor-intensive]] work. In fact, Tianjin is considered to have become the censorship capitol for Chinese Internet.<ref name=ChinaManhattan2/><ref>{{cite journal|title=At Sina Weibo's censorship hub, China's Little Brothers cleanse online chatter|journal=Reuters|date=September 11, 2013|url=http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUKBRE98A18Z20130911?irpc=932|access-date=January 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204065454/http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUKBRE98A18Z20130911?irpc=932|archive-date=February 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The city's streetscapes incorporate nineteenth and early twentieth-century [[European architecture]], juxtaposed with the concrete and glass monoliths of contemporary China. Though areas of the city are being redeveloped, much of the [[colonial architecture]] has been placed under protection.

In the nineteenth century, the port city caught the attention of the seafaring Western powers, who used the boarding of a British ship by Chinese troops as an excuse to declare war. Using armed gunboats, they were victorious; the [[Treaty of Tianjin]], signed in 1856, gave the Europeans the right to establish nine [[Concessions in Tianjin|concessionary bases]] on the mainland, from which they could conduct trade and sell opium. These concessions, which were along the banks of the [[Hai River]], were self-contained European communities; the French built [[château]]x and towers, while the Germans constructed red-tiled Bavarian villas. Tensions between the indigenous population and the foreigners were noticeable in the [[Tianjin massacre|Tianjin Incident]] of 1870, which occurred when a Chinese mob attacked a French-run orphanage, and again during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in 1900, after which foreigners leveled the walls surrounding the old Chinese city to enable them to watch its residents.

The old city was razed entirely during 2000 and 2001 to make way for new developments. Only several old buildings, such as the Tianjin Temple of Confucius, remain.

The network of ex-concession streets south and west of the central train station and south of the Hai River now constitute the areas of most interest to visitors. The châteaux of the French concession now make up the downtown district just south of the river and mansions that the British built are east of the area. Farther east and south of the river, the architecture has a slight German construction.

Tianjin's harbor area of Binhai/TEDA has a modern, high-speed rubber-tired tram system; it is the first of its kind in China and Asia. Constructed in 2006, the system marked a return of the tram to Tianjin, which once had a standard steel-wheeled tramway network. The original Tianjin tram network was constructed by a Belgian company<ref>{{Cite web |title=Souvenirs de Chine: The story of a Belgian engineer and doctors in China 1898-1908 |url=https://www.ugent.be/vandenhove/en/exhibitions/archive/souvenirs-de-chine-the-story-of-a-belgian-engineer-and-doctors-in-china-1898-1908 |access-date=October 4, 2021 |archive-date=October 4, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211004233116/https://www.ugent.be/vandenhove/en/exhibitions/archive/souvenirs-de-chine-the-story-of-a-belgian-engineer-and-doctors-in-china-1898-1908 |url-status=live }}</ref> in 1904 and opened in 1906. It was the first citywide tramway system in China. It closed in 1972.

===Metro===
[[File:天津轨道交通--刘园折返线.jpg|thumb|The [[Tianjin Metro]] near Liuyuan station]]
The [[Tianjin Metro]] was formerly operated by two companies, Tianjin Metro General Corporation and Tianjin Binhai Mass Transit Development Company. However, in 2017, the two companies merged to form the Tianjin Rail Transit Group Corporation. It is currently under expansion to create five to nine lines.{{cn|date=October 2024}} A total of six lines are currently operating in the city and the Binhai area. As of April 2019, the entire network of [[Tianjin Metro]] has 155 stations and 6 lines.

Construction work on the Tianjin Metro started on July 4, 1970. It was the second metro to be built in China and commenced service in 1984. The total length of track was {{convert|7.4|km|0|sp=us}}. The metro service was suspended on October 9, 2001, for reconstruction. The original line is now part of [[Line 1, Tianjin Metro|Line 1]] of the new metro system. It was reopened to the public in June 2006. The track was extended to {{convert|26.2|km|3|abbr=on}};<ref>{{Cite web |title=UrbanRail.Net > Asia > China > TIANJIN (Tientsin) Subway |url=http://www.urbanrail.net/as/cn/tian/tianjin.htm |access-date=October 4, 2021 |archive-date=December 26, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211226135017/http://urbanrail.net/as/cn/tian/tianjin.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> there is now a total of 22 stations. Construction work on Line 2 and Line 3 was completed in 2012; the two lines are now in operation. Several new metro lines have been planned.

The two rapid transit operators in Tianjin are responsible for the service as follows:

* Tianjin Metro General Corporation operates Lines 1, 2, 3 and 6.
* Tianjin Binhai Mass Transit Development Company. operates Lines 5 and 9

===Rail===
[[File:Tianjin_Station_03.jpg|thumb|[[Tianjin railway station]]]]
There are several railway stations in the city, [[Tianjin railway station]] being one of them. It was built in 1888. The station was initially located at Wangdaozhuang ({{zh|s=旺道庄|t=旺道莊|hp=Wàngdàozhuāng|links=no}}). The station was later moved to Laolongtou ({{zh|s=老龙头|t=老龍頭|hp=Lǎolóngtóu|links=no}}) on the banks of the [[Hai He]] River in 1892; as a result, the station was renamed as Laolongtou Railway Station. The station was completely rebuilt in 1988. The rebuilding work began on April 15, 1987, and was finished on October 1, 1988. The Tianjin Railway Station is also locally known as the 'East Station', due to its geographic position. In January 2007, the station began another long-term restructuring project to modernize the facility as part of the larger Tianjin transport hub project, which involves [[Tianjin Metro]] lines 2, 3, and 9, as well as the Tianjin-Beijing High-Speed Rail.

[[Tianjin West railway station]] and [[Tianjin North railway station]] are also railway stations in Tianjin. [[Tanggu railway station]] is located in the port area of [[Tanggu District]]; [[Binhai railway station]] and [[Binhai North railway station]] are located to the north of Tanggu in [[Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area|TEDA]]. There are several other railway stations in the city that do not handle passenger traffic. Construction on a [[Beijing-Tianjin high-speed rail]]way began on July 4, 2005, and was completed during August 2008.

The following [[Rail transport in the People's Republic of China|rail lines]] go through Tianjin:

* [[Jingshan Railway]] (travels from Beijing to [[Shanhai Pass]])
* [[Jinpu Railway]] (travels from Tianjin to [[Pukou District]], [[Nanjing]])
* Jinji Railway (travels from the urban area of Tianjin to [[Ji County, Tianjin|Ji County]], Tianjin)

[[File:炫彩津门0天津西站全景Panorama_of_Tianjin_West_Railway_Station.jpg|thumb|[[Tianjin West railway station]]]]
The inter-city trains between Beijing and Tianjin will adopt a new numbering system using the letter C (C stands for InterCity) followed by four numbers. The train numbers range between C2001 and C2298. The number ranges are divided into three different groups, which provide information about where a train will go:

* C2001–C2198: Directly from Beijing South Station to Tianjin
* C2201–C2268: From Beijing South Station to Tianjin, with stops at Wuqing Station (武清站)
* C2271–C2298: From Beijing South Station to Yujiapu Railway Station in Tianjin<ref>{{cite web |date=July 31, 2008 |title=New Beijing-Tianjin intercity train numbering system |url=http://www.shike.org.cn/news.asp?nId=3175 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720154522/http://www.shike.org.cn/news.asp?nId=3175 |archive-date=July 20, 2011 |access-date=March 15, 2011 |publisher=Shike.org.cn}}</ref>

The new C trains take 30 minutes to travel between Beijing and Tianjin; the trains make the journey with half the time used by the previous D trains. The ticket price, as of Aug 15, 2008, is 69 [[Renminbi|RMB]] for first-class seating and 58 RMB for second-class seating.

===Bus===
[[File:4-2527_at_Jichangyihaolu_(20200515120228).jpg|thumb|Tianjin Bus Route 678]]

===Roads and expressways===
Some roads and bridges, such as  [[Three Principles of the People|Minquan]] Gate and [[Beiyang]] Road, have retained names given to them while the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (1912–1949) was in power. As in other cities in China, some roads in Tianjin are named after Chinese provinces and cities. Unlike Beijing, Tianjin has few roads that run parallel to the four [[cardinal direction]]s.

Tianjin has three ring roads. The Inner and Middle Ring Roads are not closed, traffic-controlled roadways and some often have traffic light intersections. The Outer Ring Road is similar to a highway-level ring road. The road experiences traffic.

* [[Inner Ring Road (Tianjin)|Inner Ring Road ''(neihuan)'']]
* [[Middle Ring Road (Tianjin)|Middle Ring Road ''(zhonghuan)'']]
* [[Outer Ring Road (Tianjin)|Outer Ring Road ''(waihuan)'']]

Tianjin's roads often finish in ''dao'' ({{zh|s=道|l=avenue|links=no}}) and ''xian'' ({{zh|s=线|t=線|l=line|links=no}}). These suffixes are most often used for highways and [[through route]]s. The terms ''lu'' ({{zh|s=路|l=road|links=no}}) and j''ie'' ({{zh|s=街|l=street|links=no}}) are not generally used. As Tianjin's roads are tend to not be in cardinal directions, ''jing'' ({{zh|s=经|t=經|l=avenue|links=no}}) roads and ''wei'' ({{zh|s=纬|t=緯|l=avenue|links=no}}) roads appear; these roads attempt to run more directly north–south and east–west, respectively.

The following seven [[expressways of China]] run in or through Tianjin:

* [[Jingjintang Expressway]] (travels from Beijing, through Tianjin's urban area, to [[Tanggu District]] / [[Tianjin Economic Development Area|TEDA]])
* [[Jinghu Expressway]] (travels from Jinjing Gonglu Bridge to Shanghai; similarly to [[Jingjintang Expressway]], this expressway travels from Beijing to Shanghai)
* [[Beijing−Shenyang Expressway|Jingshen Expressway]] (travels through [[Baodi District]] on its way from Beijing to [[Shenyang]])
* [[Tangjin Expressway]] (travels from [[Tanggu District]], Tianjin, to [[Tangshan]], Hebei''—''known as the Jintang Expressway in Tianjin)
* [[Baojin Expressway]] (travels from [[Beichen District]], Tianjin, to [[Baoding]], Hebei''—''known as the Jinbao Expressway in Tianjin)
* [[Jinbin Expressway]] (travels from Zhangguizhuang Bridge to Hujiayuan Bridge; both bridges are in Tianjin)
* [[Jinji Expressway]] (travels from central Tianjin to [[Jixian County]])

The following six [[China National Highway]]s pass through Tianjin:

* [[China National Highway 102]] (travels through [[Ji County, Tianjin]] on its way from Beijing to [[Harbin]]
* [[China National Highway 103]] (travels from Beijing, through Tianjin's urban area, to [[Tanggu District]])
* [[China National Highway 104]] (travels from Beijing, through Tianjin Municipality, to [[Fuzhou]])
* [[China National Highway 105]] (travels from Beijing, through Tianjin Municipality, to [[Macau]])
* [[China National Highway 112]] (a circular highway around Beijing; passes through Tianjin Municipality)
* [[China National Highway 205]] (travels from [[Shanhaiguan District|Shanhaiguan]], Hebei, through Tianjin Municipality, to [[Guangzhou]])
