'''Geneina''' (sometimes '''Al-Junaynah''' or '''El{{nbsp}}Geneina'''; {{langx|ar|الجنينة}}, lit. ''the little garden'') is a [[city]] in [[West Darfur]], part of the [[dar Masalit]] region, in [[Sudan]]. It joined [[British Sudan]] at the end of 1919 through the Gilani Agreement, signed between the Masalit Sultanate and the [[United Kingdom]], according to which it became a territory.

Geneina is now the capital of the Sudanese state of [[West Darfur]]. As of 2022, it had a population of 538,390  pre-war being one of the most populated cities within the country. According to the UNICEF nearly the entire population are [[Internally displaced person|IDPs]] and a large part are still young children.<ref>{{cite web |title =West Darfur |url=https://www.unicef.org/sudan/media/8761/file/West%20Darfur.pdf |website=www.unicef.org}}</ref>

During the [[2023 Sudan conflict]], the [[Battle of Geneina]] was fought. This event included the deadly Geneina massacre, in which, as of 19 August 2023, thousands of civilians were killed, mainly [[Masalit_people|Masalits]] and other non-Arab tribes. The RSF took control of the city by 22 June.<ref>{{cite report |date= 2023 |title =  Sudan: West Darfur Clashes Leave 25 Dead, Prisoners Freed in Nyala, El Fasher and ED Daein |url= https://allafrica.com/stories/202304270544.html |page= 11 |access-date= 14 May 2023}}</ref>

The city has the biggest group of [[Masalit people]] in Sudan and [[Darfur]]. This group was heavily targeted during the War in Darfur but had remained in a state of peace for several years. During the War in Darfur, genocide against the Masalit people caught the attention of the UN, sparking controversy between the organization and Sudan. <ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.refworld.org/docid/54f043de4.html | title=UNHCR Web Archive |website=www.refworld.org |date=17 January 2015 |access-date=2024-03-20}}</ref>

In early 2023, tensions rose between the [[Sudanese Armed Forces]], led by the 2021 coup leader [[Abdel Fattah al-Burhan]], and the paramilitary [[Rapid Support Forces]] led by [[Hemedti]], remnants of Omar al-Bashir's [[Janjaweed]] that [[Darfur genocide|committed ethnic cleansing]] against non-Arab tribes in [[Darfur]]. These tensions came to a head on 15 April 2023, when RSF forces attacked Sudanese forces in [[Khartoum]], [[Merowe, Sudan|Merowe]], and several cities across Darfur, including [[Nyala, Sudan|Nyala]], [[Al-Fashir|El Fasher]], and Geneina.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sudan unrest: RSF captures presidential palace as violence rages |url=https://www.geo.tv/latest/482255-sudan-unrest-rsf-captures-presidential-palace-as-violence-rages |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230416163354/https://www.geo.tv/latest/482255-sudan-unrest-rsf-captures-presidential-palace-as-violence-rages |archive-date=16 April 2023 |access-date=18 April 2023 |website=www.geo.tv |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=15 April 2023 |title=Fighting between Sudan military rivals enters a second day, with dozens dead |url=https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/15/africa/sudan-presidential-palace-intl/index.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230415200754/https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/15/africa/sudan-presidential-palace-intl/index.html |archive-date=15 April 2023 |access-date=16 April 2023 |website=CNN |language=en}}</ref>

Geneina was considered strategic due to its important location in Darfur, it remained a large location for West Darfur and [[Chadian people|Chadian]] civilians who had almost no access to food or education due to the deserted regions. 

In early 2023, tensions rose between the [[Sudanese Armed Forces]], led by the 2021 coup leader [[Abdel Fattah al-Burhan]], and the paramilitary [[Rapid Support Forces]] led by [[Hemedti]], remnants of Omar al-Bashir's [[Janjaweed]] that [[Darfur genocide|committed ethnic cleansing]] against non-Arab tribes in [[Darfur]]. These tensions came to a head on 15 April, when RSF forces attacked Sudanese forces in [[Khartoum]], [[Merowe, Sudan|Merowe]], and several cities across Darfur, including [[Nyala, Sudan|Nyala]], [[Al-Fashir|El Fasher]], and Geneina.

In Geneina, [[West Darfur]] governor [[Khamis Abakar]] declared a state of emergency on 10 April due to the killing of three people by the [[Sudanese Alliance]], a militia led by the governor.<ref>{{Cite news |last=SudanTribune |date=11 April 2023 |title=West Darfur declares state of emergency after killing of three people |url=https://sudantribune.com/article272780/ |access-date=11 May 2023 |website=Sudan Tribune |language=en-US }}</ref> Clashes between Arabs and non-Arabs also broke out in [[Foro Baranga|Foro-Baranga]], on the border with Chad, on 13 April, leaving 24 people dead.<ref>{{Cite web |date=13 April 2023 |title=Official: 24 killed in Sudan as Arab, non-Arab groups clash in Darfur |url=https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/rest-of-africa/24-killed-in-sudan-darfur-clashes-4197516 |access-date=11 May 2023 |website=The East African |language=en}}</ref>

The city came under siege by RSF and aligned militias by early June, and ended with the RSF gaining control El Geneina by the 22 of June. Up to 15,000 people were killed in Geneina in the [[Masalit massacres (2023–present)|Masalit massacres]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Ethnic killings in one Sudan city left up to 15,000 dead: UN report |url=https://www.tbsnews.net/worldbiz/africa/ethnic-killings-one-sudan-city-left-15000-dead-un-report-777970 |work=The Business Standard |date=20 January 2024}}</ref>

=== History of the name "Geneina" ===
The word “Geneina” in Arabic means garden, and it is a diminutive of the word paradise, with the resulting meaning of garden or orchard. The city of El Geneina was given this name on account of its green nature, as the city is full of gardens, orchards, and green fields. The name also goes back to Sultan Bahr al-Din, Sultan of Masalit, who was the first to rule the city. It is called “Al-Geneina Enduka”, which is the nickname of Sultan Muhammad Bahr al-Din Enduka. The Masalit word Enduka implies extreme generosity.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Geneina has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSh'') with two distinct seasons: a short, warm and humid [[wet season]] from mid-June to late September, which causes lakes and ponds to form at some points of the year, and a long, hot, desiccating [[dry season]] covering the remaining nine months of the year.

== Economy ==
The city is characterized by the presence of many economic sources, and its economy depends on the sectors: agriculture, pastoralism, trade, and services.
[[File:Al Junaynah arch.jpg|thumb|A sign at the entrance of Geneina in Arabic saying "Geneina welcomes you!"]]
Agriculture constitutes the sector on which the economy relies the most for soil fertility and the abundance of rain and groundwater. The spread of hashab tree forests around the city has made it an important source for the production of gum arabic. In addition to this, crops such as cotton, tobacco, sorghum, sesame, millet, watermelon, hibiscus, okra and some fruits are grown, such as mango, guava, papaya and orange.

Grazing and livestock raising come in second place as economic resources in the El Geneina area, including cows, goats, and camels.

Trade, including local retail trade and export trade, constitutes a source of wealth and production in the city, in addition to the various services sector.

[[File:Sudan Envoy - Transportation.jpg|thumb|A resident uses an animals transportation across the city.]]
Most of the city's roads are unpaved, but the city has a highway which leads to Nyala. {{Efn|The highway was most likely destroyed due to the battle.}} The locality is served by the [[Geneina Airport]] {{airport codes|EGN|HSGN}} and the El Shaheed Sibeira Airport {{airport codes||HSSG}}, which hosts the [[Sudanese Armed Forces]], and is used for flights across the country of [[Sudan]]. Since the start of the conflict, the airport has been closed and most likely destroyed due to large amounts of shelling and continued fighting.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://jamestown.org/program/there-will-be-no-dar-masalit-only-dar-arab-sudans-ethnic-divisions-destroy-west-darfur/ | title="There Will be No Dar Masalit, Only Dar Arab": Sudan's Ethnic Divisions Destroy West Darfur |website=jamestown.org |author=Andrew McGregor |date=2023-06-26 |access-date=2024-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/collapse-at-west-darfur-s-new-airport | title=Collapse at West Darfur's new airport |website=www.dabangasudan.org |date=14 July 2014 |access-date=2024-03-20}}</ref> The closest airports to it are Zalingei Airport, which is 110 kilometers (68.3 miles) away, and El Fasher Airport and Adre Airport in Chad.
