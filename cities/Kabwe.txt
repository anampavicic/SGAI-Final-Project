'''Kabwe''' is the capital of the [[Zambia]]n [[Central Province, Zambia|Central Province]] and the [[Kabwe District]], with a population estimated at 288,598 at the 2022 census.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |title=Zambia: Provinces, Major Cities & Urban Centers - Population Statistics, Maps, Charts, Weather and Web Information |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/zambia/cities/ |access-date=2024-09-11 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref> Named '''Broken Hill''' until 1966, it was founded when [[lead]] and [[zinc]] deposits were discovered in 1902.

Kabwe is an important transportation, farming and university centre. Kabwe is becoming a major agricultural hub for the country is the headquarters for [[Zambia Railways]] and prison services. Additionally the mining industry has been important to the economic development of the region. However, because of the exceptional contamination of the city with lead and other toxins, and the effects of these on local children's health, a March 2022 report by the [[United Nations special rapporteur|UN Special Rapporteur]] on Human Rights and the Environment identified the town as a [[sacrifice zone]] for industry.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Boyd |first=David R |url=https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2022-03/SacrificeZones-userfriendlyversion.pdf |title=Sacrifice zones 50 of the Most Polluted Places on Earth |publisher=Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and the Environment |year=2022}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Headquarters of Zambia Railways ===
[[File:Rhodesian Railways under construction near Broken Hill Zambia.png|thumb|left|upright|Part of the railway near Kabwe under construction (ca. 1906)]]
The first railway in the country, operated by [[Rhodesian Railways]] when the territory was administered as [[North-Western Rhodesia]] the rail line reached [[Kabwe mine|Broken Hill mine]] as early as 1906, and the town became the northern base for the railway, which was the second biggest employer after the [[mining]] industry. A locomotive maintenance facility was constructed there. In 1909 the railway reached [[Ndola]] in the Lambaland which was to become the [[Copperbelt]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The railway workers' unions played a large role in the politics of the country. In racially segregated colonial times before Africans had the vote, the town was the seat of [[Roy Welensky]], leader of the powerful [[Rhodesia Railway Workers Union]] (RRWU), who became [[prime minister]] of the ill-fated [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]], which was opposed by the Northern Rhodesia Railway [[trade union]] (the black Africans' union) led by [[Dixon Konkola]] and also based in Kabwe.<ref name="TZ"/>
 
Today, the town is the headquarters of [[Zambia Railways]] but employment levels on the railway have been heavily cut.{{Citation needed|date=April 2022}}

=== Independence protest ===
Reflecting Kabwe's central location and railway union base, it was chosen as the site for a rally held on October 26, 1958, at [[Mulungushi Rock of Authority|Mulungushi Rock]] north of the city by the [[Kenneth Kaunda|Kaunda]]-[[Simon Kapwepwe|Kapwepwe]] breakaway group from the [[Zambian African National Congress]].  Later, they founded the political party [[UNIP]] which led the successful independence movement and continued to hold conferences at [[Mulungushi Rock of Authority|Mulungushi Rock]], which became known as the 'birthplace of independence' in Zambia.<ref name="TZ" />

== Districts ==

=== Makululu ===
A large informal settlement on the outskirts of the city, Makululu is an important district in the town.<ref name=":1">{{Cite report |url=https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Zambia_AFL_Case_Study_2015-8-25.pdf |title=Tackling urban flooding in a 'shanty' settlement Action at the Frontline, Kabwe, Zambia |last=Phir |first=Adrian |date=2015-08-25}}</ref> The settlement is on the edge of the [[Lukanga Swamp]], and is thus vulnerable to flooding.<ref name=":1" /> Similarly, the water is highly contaminated from both poor sanitation and the broader industrial pollution from the mine.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}}

== Environmental issues ==

=== Mine pollution ===
{{See also|Kabwe mine}}
A study by the [[Blacksmith Institute]] found Kabwe to be one of the ten most polluted places in the world due mostly to heavy metal (mostly zinc and lead) tailings making their way into the local water supply.<ref>[http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/ten.php The Blacksmith Institute website] accessed 1 March 2007.</ref> A 2014 report indicates that children's blood lead levels continue to be elevated even though mining has stopped.<ref>J. Yabe et al., "[[Lead poisoning]] in children from townships in the vicinity of a leadâzinc mine in Kabwe, Zambia", ''Chemosphere'' 119 (January 2015),  941â947, {{doi|10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.09.028}}.</ref> A 2020 study, found high levels of lead and cadmium in blood levels.<ref>{{Cite web |last=University |first=Hokkaido |title=The lasting effects of pollution from the Kabwe mine |url=https://phys.org/news/2020-11-effects-pollution-kabwe.html |access-date=2022-05-11 |website=phys.org |language=en}}</ref> A March 2022 report by the [[United Nations special rapporteur|UN Special Rapporteur]] on Human Rights and the Environment identified the town as a [[sacrifice zone]] for industry.<ref name=":0" />

Other studies, have found high potential for copper, cobalt and other non-lead materials in leachate from the mine.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Sracek |first1=O. |last2=VeselovskÃ½ |first2=F. |last3=KÅÃ­bek |first3=B. |last4=Malec |first4=J. |last5=JehliÄka |first5=J. |date=2010-12-01 |title=Geochemistry, mineralogy and environmental impact of precipitated efflorescent salts at the Kabwe CuâCo chemical leaching plant in Zambia |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883292710002106 |journal=Applied Geochemistry |language=en |volume=25 |issue=12 |pages=1815â1824 |doi=10.1016/j.apgeochem.2010.09.008 |bibcode=2010ApGC...25.1815S |issn=0883-2927}}</ref>

A [[class action]] lawsuit was launched against [[Anglo American plc]], alleging that it ignored the required safety standards despite knowing about the harms caused. Anglo-American was the majority owner of the mine from 1925 until its 1974 nationalization by the Zambian government. A certification hearing was held at the [[High Court of South Africa]]'s Johannesburg branch in February 2023.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news |last=Gbadamosi |first=Nosmot |date=8 February 2023 |title=Zambia Takes Anglo American to Court |work=[[Foreign Policy]] |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/02/08/zambia-south-africa-anglo-american-mining-court-lawsuit/ |access-date=9 February 2023}}</ref>

== Transportation ==
Kabwe is on the [[T2 road (Zambia)|T2 road]] ([[Great North Road, Zambia|Great North Road]]) to [[Kapiri Mposhi]] in the north (with a branch route to [[Ndola]]) and [[Lusaka]] in the south.<ref name=":12">{{Cite web |title=Roads and Road Traffic Act {{!}} National Assembly of Zambia |url=https://www.parliament.gov.zm/node/1492 |access-date=2022-06-27 |website=www.parliament.gov.zm}}</ref> It is also on the [[Zambia Railways]] line.

=== Accidents and incidents ===
On February 7, 2013, a [[Chibombo bus crash|bus collided with two cars]] south of Kabwe, killing 53 people.<ref>{{cite news |date=7 February 2013 |title=Dozens killed in Zambia as bus crashes into truck |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/07/zambia-bus-crash |accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref><ref name="New Zimbabwe">{{cite news |title=53 dead in Zambia bus-truck crash |work=New Zimbabwe |publisher=AFP |url=http://www.newzimbabwe.com/news-10217-53+dead+in+Zambia+bus-truck+crash/news.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209061558/http://www.newzimbabwe.com/news-10217-53+dead+in+Zambia+bus-truck+crash/news.aspx |archive-date=9 February 2013 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref>

== Industries and agriculture ==
Historically the economy of Kabwe has been dominated by the mine. Other industries include pharmaceuticals, milling and cotton ginning, and Kabwe's first Drinking Water Plant (Aquador Purifed Water) and [[leather tanning]].<ref name="ZM">[http://www.zamnet.zm/newsys/news/viewnews.cgi?category=4&id=1100549219 Zamnet Online News:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023154750/http://www.zamnet.zm/newsys/news/viewnews.cgi?category=4&id=1100549219|date=2007-10-23}} "Kabwe: From discovery to recovery" (Zambia Daily Mail),
website accessed 7 March 2007.</ref>

To the east of the city are the hydro-electric power stations of the [[Mulungushi Dam]], [[Mita Hills Dam]] and [[Lunsemfwa River|Lunsemfwa Falls]], built to power the mine and town.{{Citation needed|date=April 2022}}

Commercial farming areas surround the city about 10&nbsp;km from the centre, and the road and rail links provide ready access to the markets of the Copperbelt and Lusaka.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

=== Mine ===
{{See also|Kabwe mine}}
The name ''Kabwe'' or ''Kabwe-Ka Mukuba'' means 'ore' or 'smelting' but the European/Australian prospectors named it Broken Hill after a similar mine in [[Broken Hill, New South Wales]], Australia.<ref name="ZM" /> The mine was the largest in the country for around thirty years until it was overtaken in the early 1930s by larger copper mining complexes on the [[Copperbelt]].  Apart from lead and zinc it also produced [[silver]], [[manganese]] and heavy metals such as [[cadmium]], [[vanadium]], and [[titanium]] in smaller quantities.<ref>[[Bruce Kapferer]]: "Strategy and Transaction in an African Factory", Manchester: Manchester University Press 1972</ref>

In 1921 a [[human fossil]], a skull, dubbed ''[[Kabwe 1]]'', also "Broken Hill Man" or "Rhodesian Man" (classified as ''[[Homo rhodesiensis]]'' or ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'') was found in the mine.

[[Anglo American plc]] became the majority owner of the mine in 1925, until the mine was nationalized in 1974 by the Zambian government, who closed it in 1994.<ref name=":2" />

The mine, which occupies a 2.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> site 1&nbsp;km south-west of the town centre, is closed but metals are still extracted from old [[tailings]].

Closure of the mine led to economic decline for Kabwe.<ref name="ZM" /> It has a number of [[manufacturing]] industries including the Zambia-China Mulungushi [[textiles]] plant established with Chinese investment in the 1980s, but after suffering large losses this plant closed (temporarily according to management) at the beginning of 2007.{{Citation needed|date=April 2022}}

== Climate ==
Kabwe has a [[subtropical highland climate]] (''Cwa'') with warm, wet summers, mild dry winters and hot springs.
