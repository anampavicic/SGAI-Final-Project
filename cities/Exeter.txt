'''Exeter''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Exeter.ogg|ˈ|ɛ|k|s|ɪ|t|ər}} {{respell|EK|sit|ər}}) is a [[City status in the United Kingdom|cathedral city]] and the [[county town]] of [[Devon]], [[South West England]]. It is situated on the [[River Exe]], approximately {{cvt|36|mi|km|abbr=off}} northeast of [[Plymouth]] and {{cvt|65|mi|km|abbr=off}} southwest of [[Bristol]].

In [[Roman Britain]], Exeter was established as the base of [[Legio II Augusta]] under the personal command of [[Vespasian]]. Exeter became a religious centre in the [[Middle Ages]]. [[Exeter Cathedral]], founded in the mid 11th century, became [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] in the 16th-century [[English Reformation]]. Exeter became an affluent centre for the [[wool trade]], although by the [[First World War]] the city was in decline. After the [[Second World War]], much of the city centre was rebuilt and is now a centre for education, business and tourism in Devon and Cornwall. It is home to two of the constituent campuses of the [[University of Exeter]]: [[Streatham Campus|Streatham]] and [[St Luke's Campus|St Luke's]].

The administrative area of Exeter has the status of a [[non-metropolitan district]] under the administration of the County Council. It is the county town of Devon and home to the headquarters of [[Devon County Council]]. A plan to grant the city [[unitary authority]] status was scrapped by the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|2010 coalition government]].{{citation needed|date=November 2023}}

==Name==
The modern name of Exeter is a development of the [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|Escanceaster}},<ref name="tcodoepn">{{Cite book |last=Eilert Ekwall |title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1981 |isbn=0-19-869103-3 |page=171}}</ref> from the [[Anglicization of names|anglicised]] form of the river now known as the [[River Exe|Exe]] and the Old English [[suffix]] {{lang|ang|{{nowrap|[[Chester (placename element)|-ceaster]]}}}} (as in [[Dorset#Toponymy|Dorchester]] and [[Gloucester#Etymology|Gloucester]]), used to mark important fortresses or fortified towns (from [[Latin]] ''castrum'', meaning fortress, or ''castra'', military camp). (Similarly, the city's [[Cornish language|Cornish]] name {{lang|kw|Karesk}} and its [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name {{lang|cy|Caerwysg}} both mean "[[caer|''caer'' or fortress]] on the Exe".) The name "Exe" is a separate development of the [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] name—meaning "water"<ref name="tcodoepn"/> or, more exactly, "full of fish" (cf. Welsh {{lang|cy|pysg}}, {{abbr|pl.|Plural}} "fish")<ref>Owen, H.W. & Morgan, R. 2007 Dictionary of the Place-names of Wales Gomer Press, Ceredigion; Gwasg Gomer / Gomer Press; page 484.</ref>—that also appears in the [[England|English]] [[River Axe (Lyme Bay)|Axe]] and [[River Esk, North Yorkshire|Esk]] and the Welsh [[River Usk|Usk]] ({{lang|cy|Wysg}}).

==History==
{{Further|Timeline of Exeter}}

===Prehistory===
{{See also|Dumnonii|British Iron Age}}
Exeter began as settlements on a dry ridge ending in a spur overlooking a navigable [[River Exe|river]] teeming with fish, with fertile land nearby. Although there have been no major [[Prehistoric Britain|prehistoric]] finds, these advantages suggest the site was occupied early.<ref>Hoskins (2004), {{nowrap|pp. 4–}}5.</ref>

[[Numismatics|Coins]] have been discovered from the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic kingdoms]], suggesting the existence of a settlement trading with the Mediterranean as early as {{nowrap|250 BC}}.<ref>Hoskins (2004), {{nowrap|p. 1.}}</ref> Such early towns had been a feature of pre-Roman [[Gaul]] as described by [[Julius Caesar]] in his ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|Commentaries]]'' and it is possible that they existed in [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] as well.

The unreliable{{According to whom|date=October 2024}} source [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] stated that when [[Vespasian]] besieged the city in 49&nbsp;AD its Celtic name was ''Kaerpenhuelgoit'', meaning 'town on the hill under the high wood'.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=Hazel|title=Discovering Exeter 4/Pennsylvania|url=https://exetercivicsociety.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Book-4-Pennsylvania.pdf|year=1984|publisher=Exeter Civic Society|page=2}}</ref>

===Roman times===
{{Main|Isca Dumnoniorum|Legio II Augusta|Roman Britain}}
The [[Ancient Romans|Romans]] established a {{cvt|42|acre|ha|adj=on}} 'playing-card' shaped (rectangle with round corners and two short and two long sides) fort ({{langx|la|[[castrum]]}}) named '''[[Isca Dumnoniorum|Isca]]''' around AD&nbsp;55. The fort was the southwest terminus of the [[Fosse Way]] (Route 15 of the ''[[Antonine Itinerary]]'') and served as the base of the {{nowrap|5&thinsp;000-}}man [[Legio II Augusta|Second Augustan Legion]] ({{lang|la|Legio II Augusta}}) at some time led by Vespasian, later Roman Emperor, for the next 20 years before they moved to [[Caerleon]] in [[Wales]], which was also known as [[Isca Augusta|Isca]]. To distinguish the two, the Romans also referred to Exeter as {{nowrap|'''Isca Dumnoniorum'''}}, "Watertown of the [[Dumnonii]]", and Caerleon as Isca Augusta. A small fort was also maintained at [[Topsham, Devon|Topsham]]; a supply depot on the route between the two was excavated at {{nowrap|St Loyes}} near Topsham Road in 2010.<ref>{{Cite web |title=fragments of incence burner or tazza (vessel (sherd)) |url=https://rammcollections.org.uk/collections/346a906a-29fe-396c-a1ca-0a0aff800a91 |access-date=2024-01-17 |website=Royal Albert Memorial Museum & Art Gallery |language=en-GB }}{{Dead link|date=April 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

The presence of the fort built up an unplanned civilian community ({{lang|la|[[vicus]]}} or {{lang|la|[[canabae]]}}) of [[Britons (Celtic people)|natives]] and the soldiers' families, mostly to the northeast of the fort. This settlement served as the [[civitas|tribal capital]] ({{lang|la|civitas}}) of the [[Dumnonii]]<ref name="bidy">Bidwell, Paul&nbsp;T. ''Roman Exeter: Fortress and Town'', {{nowrap|p.&nbsp;56}}. Exeter City Council (Exeter), 1980. {{ISBN|0-86114-270-5}}.</ref> and was listed as one of their four cities ({{lang-grc-gre|[[poleis]]|script=Latn}}) by [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]''<ref name="RBOD">{{Cite web |title=The Celtic Tribes of Britain: The Dumnonii |url=http://www.roman-britain.co.uk/tribes/dumnonii/ |url-status=live |publisher=Roman Britain|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326032516/https://www.roman-britain.co.uk/tribes/dumnonii/|archive-date=26 Mar 2023}}</ref> (it also appeared in the 7th-century ''[[Ravenna Cosmography]]'', where it appears as an apparently [[scribal error|confused]] entry for {{lang|la|Scadu Namorum}}<ref name="RBOID">{{Cite web |title=isca dvmnoniorvm |url=http://www.roman-britain.co.uk/places/isca_dumnoniorum/ |url-status=live |publisher=Roman Britain|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326021823/https://www.roman-britain.co.uk/places/isca_dumnoniorum/|archive-date=26 Mar 2023}}</ref>). When the fortress was abandoned around the year 75, its grounds were converted to civilian purposes: its very large [[thermae|bathhouse]] was demolished to make way for a [[forum (Roman)|forum]] and a [[basilica]], and a smaller-scale bath was erected to the southeast.<ref name=bidy/> This area was excavated in the 1970s,<ref>{{Cite web |date=June 2002 |title=Great Sites: Exeter Roman Baths |url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba65/feat2.shtml |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200646/http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba65/feat2.shtml |archive-date=27 September 2007 |access-date=12 July 2008 |website=British Archaeology magazine}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=The Roman Fortress at Exeter: the Roman Bath House |url=http://www.exeter.gov.uk/timetrail/02_romanfortress/bath_house.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604101008/http://www.exeter.gov.uk/timetrail/02_romanfortress/bath_house.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=4 June 2008 |access-date=12 July 2008}}</ref> but could not be maintained for public view owing to its proximity to the [[Exeter Cathedral|present-day cathedral]].

In the late 2nd century, the ditch and rampart defences around the old fortress were replaced by a bank and wall enclosing a much larger area, some {{convert|92|acre|ha|abbr=off}}.<ref name="B59">Bidwell (1980), {{nowrap|p. 59}}.</ref> Although most of the visible structure is older, the course of the Roman wall was used for Exeter's subsequent city walls. Thus about 70% of the Roman wall remains, and most of its route can be traced on foot. The Devonian Isca seems to have been most prosperous in the first half of the 4th century: more than a thousand [[Roman coins]] have been found around the city and there is evidence for copper and bronze working, a stock-yard, and markets for the livestock, crops, and pottery produced in the surrounding countryside.<ref>Bidwell (1980), {{nowrap|pp. 69–}}76 & 80.</ref> The dating of the coins so far discovered, however, suggests a rapid decline: virtually none have been discovered dated after the year 380.<ref>Hoskins (2004),&nbsp;p.14.</ref>

Exeter was known to the Saxons as '''Escanceaster'''.<ref name=tcodoepn/> In 876, it was [[Viking invasions of England|attacked and briefly captured]] by [[Danes (ancient people)|Danish]] [[Vikings]]. [[Alfred the Great]] drove them out the next summer.<ref name="HOS23" /> Over the next few years, he elevated Exeter to one of the four ''[[burh]]s'' in Devon, rebuilding its walls on the Roman lines.<ref name="SEL17">Sellman (1985), {{nowrap|p. 17}}.</ref> These permitted the city to fend off another attack and siege by the Danes in 893.<ref name="SEL17" /> [[Athelstan of England|King Athelstan]] again strengthened the walls around 928, and at the same time drove out the remaining [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] from the city.<ref name="HOS23">Hoskins (2004), {{nowrap|p. 23}}.</ref> (It is uncertain, though, whether they had lived in the city continuously since the Roman period or returned from the countryside when Alfred strengthened its defences.<ref>Higham (2008), {{nowrap|p. 47}}.</ref>) According to [[William of Malmesbury]], they were sent beyond the [[River Tamar]], which was fixed as the boundary of Devon. (This may, however, have served as a territorial boundary within the former kingdom of [[Dumnonia]] as well.<ref>Higham (2008), {{nowrap|p. 19}}.</ref>) Other references suggest that the British simply moved to what is now the {{nowrap|St David's}} area, not far outside Exeter's walls. The quarter vacated by the Britons was apparently adapted as "the [[earl]]'s burh" and was still named Irlesberi in the 12th century.<ref name="HOS23" /> In 1001, the Danes again failed to get into the city, but they were able to plunder it in 1003 because they were let in, for unknown reasons, by the [[Kingdom of France|French]] [[Reeve (England)|reeve]] of [[Emma of Normandy]], who had been given the city as part of her dowry on her marriage to [[Æthelred the Unready]] the previous year.<ref name="HOS23" />

[[File:Exeter - Rougemont Castle 20151024-02.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The gatehouse of [[Rougemont Castle]]]]

Two years after the [[Norman Conquest|Norman conquest of England]], Exeter rebelled against [[William the Conqueror|King William]]. [[Gytha Thorkelsdóttir]], the mother of the slain [[Harold Godwinson|King Harold]], was living in the city at the time, and William promptly marched west and [[Siege of Exeter (1068)|initiated a siege]]. After 18 days, William accepted the city's honourable surrender, swearing an oath not to harm the city or increase its [[tax|ancient tribute]]. However, William quickly arranged for the building of [[Rougemont Castle]] to strengthen Norman control over the area. Properties owned by Saxon landlords were transferred into Norman hands and, on the death of [[Leofric (bishop)|Bishop Leofric]] in 1072, the Norman [[Osbern FitzOsbern]] was appointed his successor.<ref>Hoskins (2004), {{nowrap|pp. 26–}}27.</ref>

In 1136, early in [[the Anarchy]], Rougemont Castle was held against [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] by [[Baldwin de Redvers]].

The city held a weekly market for the benefit of its citizens from at least 1213, and by 1281 Exeter was the only town in the south-west to have three market days per week.

During the high medieval period, both the cathedral clergy and the citizens enjoyed access to sophisticated aqueduct systems which brought pure drinking water into the city from springs in the neighbouring parish of St Sidwell's. For part of their length, these aqueducts were conveyed through a remarkable network of tunnels, or underground passages, which survive largely intact and which may still be visited today.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Stoyle |first=Mark |title=Water in the City: The Aqueducts and Underground Passages of Exeter |date=2014 |publisher=University of Exeter Press |isbn=978-0859898775 |location=Exeter |pages=passim}}</ref>

In 1537, the city was made a [[county corporate]]. In 1549, the city successfully withstood a month-long siege by the so-called [[Prayer Book Rebellion|Prayer Book rebels]]: Devon and Cornish folk who had been infuriated by the radical religious policies of King Edward VI. The insurgents occupied the suburbs of Exeter, burnt down two of the city gates and attempted to undermine the city walls, but were eventually forced to abandon the siege after they had been worsted in a series of bloody battles with the king's army. A number of rebels were executed in the immediate aftermath of the siege.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Stoyle |first=Mark |title=Circled with Stone: Exeter's City Walls, 1485-1660 |date=2003 |publisher=University of Exeter Press |isbn=978-0859897273 |location=Exeter |pages=78–80, 190–91}}</ref> The [[Livery Dole]] [[almshouse]]s and chapel at [[Heavitree]] were founded in March 1591 and finished in 1594.

When [[John Hooker (English constitutionalist)|John Hooker]] was appointed to the city payroll in 1561, he created the Court of Orphans as a municipal government for families broken by the premature death of their major economic source.

Exeter was secured for Parliament at the beginning of the English Civil War, and its defences very much strengthened, but in September 1643 it was captured by the Cornish Royalist Army led by Prince Maurice. Thereafter, the city remained firmly under the king's control until near the end of the war, being one of the final Royalist cities to fall into Parliamentarian hands.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Stoyle |first=Mark |title=From Deliverance to Destruction: Rebellion and Civil War in an English City |date=1996 |publisher=University of Exeter Press |isbn=978-0859894784 |location=Exeter |pages=62–108}}</ref> The surrender of Exeter was negotiated in April 1646 at [[Poltimore House]] by [[Thomas Fairfax]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hoskins |first=W.G. |title=Devon |publisher=Phillimore and Co. |year=2003 |isbn=978-1860772702 |pages=196–198 |author-link=William George Hoskins}}</ref> During this period, Exeter was an economically powerful city, with a strong trade of [[wool]]. This was partly due to the surrounding area which was "more fertile and better inhabited than that passed over the preceding day" according to Count [[Lorenzo Magalotti]] who visited the city when he was 26 years old.<ref>Gray 2000, p.16</ref> Magalotti writes of over thirty thousand people being employed in the county of Devon as part of the wool and cloth industries, merchandise that was sold to "the West Indies, Spain, France and Italy".<ref>Gray 2000, p.18</ref> Celia Fiennes also visited Exeter during this period, in the early 18th century. She remarked on the "vast trade" and "incredible quantity" in Exeter, recording that "it turns the most money in a week of anything in England", between £10,000 and £15,000.<ref>Gray 2000, p.31</ref>

Early in the [[Industrial Revolution]], Exeter's industry developed on the basis of locally available agricultural products and, since the city's location on a fast-flowing river gave it ready access to [[water power]], an early industrial site developed on drained marshland to the west of the city, at [[Exe Island]]. However, when [[steam power]] replaced water in the 19th century, Exeter was too far from sources of coal (or iron) to develop further. As a result, the city declined in relative importance and was spared the rapid 19th-century development that changed many historic European cities. Extensive canal redevelopments during this period further expanded Exeter's economy, with "vessels of 15 to 16 tons burthen [bringing] up goods and merchandise from [[Topsham, Devon|Topsham]] to the City [[Exeter Quay|Quay]]".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Oliver |first=George |title=History of the City of Exeter |year=1861 |isbn=0217799973 |page=107 |author-link=George Oliver (historian)}}</ref> In 1778 a new bridge across the Exe was opened to replace the old medieval bridge.

The first railway to arrive in Exeter was the [[Bristol and Exeter Railway]] that opened a station at [[Exeter St Davids railway station|St Davids]] on the western edge in 1844. The [[South Devon Railway Company]] extended the line westwards to [[Plymouth]], opening their own smaller station at [[Exeter St Thomas railway station|St Thomas]], above Cowick Street. A more central railway station, that at [[Exeter Central railway station|Queen Street]], was opened by the [[London and South Western Railway]] in 1860 when it opened its alternative route to London. Butchers [[Lloyd Maunder]] moved to their present base in 1915, to gain better access to the [[Great Western Railway]] for transportation of [[meat processing|meat products]] to London.

The first [[Exeter tram system|horse-drawn trams in Exeter]] were introduced in 1882 with 3 lines radiating from the city's East Gate. One line went to St David's station via New North Road, the Obelisk (where the Clock Tower now stands) and St David's Hill. The second line went out along Heavitree Road to Livery Dole and the third went to Mount Pleasant along Sidwell Street. There was a depot off New North Road.<ref>Neville 2010,&nbsp;pp.18–19</ref>

A new bridge across the Exe was opened on 29 March 1905, replacing the former Georgian bridge. Made of [[cast iron]] and steel with a [[Truss arch bridge|three hinged arch]] design, it cost £25,000 and was designed by Sir [[John Wolfe Barry]].<ref name="exebridges">{{Cite web |title=History of the Exe Bridges |url=http://www.exetermemories.co.uk/em/exebridge.php |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723104916/http://www.exetermemories.co.uk/em/exebridge.php |archive-date=23 July 2012 |access-date=15 September 2012 |website=Exeter Memories}}</ref> Also in 1905, [[Tramways in Exeter|electric trams]] replaced the horse trams<ref>Neville 2010,&nbsp;p.30</ref> with a new route which passed along the High Street, down Fore Street and over the new Exe Bridge.

A replacement church was built on the site. From the [[Royal Albert Memorial Museum]]'s collection (63/2004/4).]]

Exeter was bombed by the German Luftwaffe during the Second World War when a total of 18 raids between 1940 and 1942 flattened much of the city centre. Between April 1941 and April 1943, Exeter was defended from enemy bombers by the [[No. 307 Polish Night Fighter Squadron]], nicknamed the 'Lwów Eagle Owls', who were based at [[Exeter Airport]]. The city of [[Lwów]] shared the same motto as the city of Exeter – 'Semper Fidelis' (Always faithful).

In April and May 1942, as part of the [[Baedeker Blitz]] and specifically in response to the RAF bombing of [[Lübeck]] and [[Rostock]], {{convert|40|acre|ha|abbr=off}} of the city were leveled by incendiary bombing. Many historic buildings in the center—particularly adjacent to High Street and Sidwell Street—were destroyed, and others, including the cathedral, were damaged. On the night of 4 May, the Polish 307 Squadron dispatched four available aircraft against forty German [[Junkers Ju 88]] bombers, preventing four German aircraft from releasing their load of bombs on Exeter. 156 people were killed, but the squadron suffered no casualties in the process.

To commemorate the friendship that had formed between the 307 Squadron and Exeter, the squadron presented the city with a Polish flag on 15 November 1942 (the first British city to have had that honour) outside [[Exeter Cathedral]]. Since 2012, a Polish flag is raised over the city's Guildhall on 15 November; the day is now known as '307 Squadron Day' in Exeter. On 15 November 2017, a plaque in memory of the squadron was unveiled in the St James Chapel of Exeter Cathedral by the Polish Ambassador Arkady Rzegocki.

Large areas of the city centre were rebuilt in the 1950s, with little attempt to preserve or restore historic buildings. The street plan was altered in an attempt to improve traffic circulation, and former landmarks like St Lawrence, the College of the Vicars Choral, and Bedford circus disappeared. The modern architecture stands in sharp contrast to the red sandstone of buildings that survived the Blitz.<ref name="payne">{{Cite book |last=Payne |first=John |title=The West Country: A Cultural History |publisher=Andrews UK Limited |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-908-49350-7 |page=176}}</ref> One notable exception was [[The House That Moved]], which is one of Europe's oldest private residences,<ref>{{cite book|title=125 years with the Western Morning News|last=Mildren|first=James|year=1985|url=https://archive.org/details/125yearswithwest0000mild/page/102/mode/2up?q=%22the+house+that+moved%22|page=103|publisher=Bossiney Books |isbn=9780948158025 }}</ref> which was due for demolition for a new relief road, but was saved after the intervention of the Ministry of Works, and was moved to a new location.<ref name=express>{{cite web|publisher=Britain Express|url=https://www.britainexpress.com/counties/devon/az/exeter/house-that-moved.htm|title=The House that Moved, Exeter}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|page=31|title=The Exe Bridge, Exeter|publisher=Exeter City Council|last=Brown|first=Stewart|year=2010|url=https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-2023-1/dissemination/pdf/Exe_Bridge_Booklet.pdf}}</ref>

On 27 October 1960, following very heavy rain, the Exe overflowed and flooded large areas of Exeter including Exwick, St Thomas and Alphington. The water rose as high as 2 metres above ground level in places and 150 employees of the local firm Beach Bros were trapped for nine hours. 2,500 properties were flooded. Later the same year on 3 December the river levels rose again, flooding 1,200 properties. These floods led to the construction of new [[flood defences]] for Exeter. Work began in 1965, took 12 years to complete and cost £8 million. The defences included three [[flood relief channel]]s, and were complemented by the construction of two new concrete bridges (built in 1969 and 1972) to replace the old Exe Bridge which had obstructed the flow of the river and made the flooding worse.<ref>{{Cite web |date=28 October 2010 |title=The Exeter floods of the 1960s |url=http://www.exetermemories.co.uk/em/exeter_floods.php |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028034133/http://www.exetermemories.co.uk/em/exeter_floods.php |archive-date=28 October 2012 |access-date=15 September 2012 |website=Exeter Memories}}</ref>

A high-profile, random murder of a child occurred in the city in 1997, which today remains one of the UK's highest-profile unsolved murders. 14-year-old [[Kate Bushell]], a pupil at what is now [[West Exe School]], had her throat cut by an unidentified attacker while walking her dog along Exwick Lane, Exwick, on 15 November 1997. Despite the police insisting the killer must be local and repeatedly appealing for locals to come forward with information on ''[[Crimewatch]]'', the attacker has never been identified. Police believe Bushell's murder is possibly linked to the murder of dogwalker [[Lyn Bryant]] in Cornwall only one year later in 1998. Police have DNA evidence in the Bryant case and there remains a £10,000 reward for information in both cases.<ref>{{cite news |title=Murder of Exeter schoolgirl Kate Bushell remains unsolved after 23 years |url=https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/murder-exeter-schoolgirl-kate-bushell-4700013 |access-date=4 August 2022 |work=DevonLive |date=15 November 2020}}</ref>

===Parliamentary===
Exeter is in two parliamentary constituencies, the majority of the city is in the [[Exeter (UK Parliament constituency)|Exeter constituency]] but two wards (St Loyes and Topsham) are in [[East Devon (UK Parliament constituency)|East Devon]]. Since World War II until recently, Exeter itself was relatively marginal, with its Member of Parliament usually drawn from the governing party. Nowadays the Exeter seat is increasingly becoming a Labour stronghold. The Exeter MP is [[Steve Race]], with the Youth MP being Georgia Howell, and [[Simon Jupp]] represents East Devon. Prior to [[Brexit]] in 2020, Exeter was part of the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England European constituency]], which elected 6 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s.

Further to the completion of the [[2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies]], [[Exmouth and Exeter East (UK Parliament constituency)|Exmouth and Exeter East]] will first be contested at the [[2024 United Kingdom general election|2024 general election]].<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Heptinstall |first1=Ollie Heptinstall |last2=Segal |first2=Andrew |date=2023-06-28 |title=Parliamentary constituency of Exmouth and East Exeter proposed |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpe9x7w31d3o |access-date=2023-07-29 |website=BBC News |language=en-GB}}</ref>

===Local Government===
{{Main|Exeter City Council}}
Exeter's [[city council]] is a [[Non-metropolitan district|district]] authority, and shares responsibility for local government with the [[Devon County Council]]. In May 2012 Labour became the majority party on the council. [[Exeter City Council]]'s bid for the city to become a [[Unitary Authority]] was initially approved by ministers in February 2010. A judicial review was called by Devon County Council and the Court held that the Minister had acted unlawfully in granting Unitary status to Exeter at the same time, however, following the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|new coalition government]] announced in May 2010 that the reorganisation would be blocked.<ref name="coalition">{{Cite web |date=20 May 2010 |title=The Coalition: our programme for government |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_187876.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612015906/http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/%40dg/%40en/documents/digitalasset/dg_187876.pdf |archive-date=12 June 2011 |access-date=24 May 2010 |publisher=HM Government, United Kingdom}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Hennessy |first=Patrick |date=22 May 2010 |title=The Queen's Speech: Bill by Bill |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/liberaldemocrats/7753762/The-Queens-Speech-Bill-by-Bill.html |url-status=dead |access-date=24 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525102927/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/liberaldemocrats/7753762/The-Queens-Speech-Bill-by-Bill.html |archive-date=25 May 2010}}</ref>

As part of the [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II]] Exeter was chosen to receive the title of [[Lord Mayor]]. Councillor Granville Baldwin became the first Lord Mayor of Exeter on 1 May 2002 when [[Letters Patent]] were awarded to the city during a visit by the Queen.
The Lord Mayor is elected each year from amongst the 39 Exeter city [[councillor]]s and is non-political for the term of office.

===Public services===
Policing in Exeter is provided by the [[Devon and Cornwall Constabulary]] who have their headquarters at Middlemoor in the east of the city.

The [[fire service]] is provided by the [[Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service]], which is headquartered at Clyst St George near Exeter. It has two fire stations located at Danes Castle and Middlemoor.

The [[Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust]] has a large hospital located to the south-east of the city centre. Ambulance services in Exeter are provided by [[South Western Ambulance Service]] NHS Trust. The West Trust Divisional HQ and 999 control is in Exeter which provides cover for [[Devon]], Cornwall, [[Somerset]] and the [[Isles of Scilly]].

==Geography==
{{See also|List of places in Exeter}}
[[File:River Exe at Exeter - geograph.org.uk - 258229.jpg|thumb|left|The River Exe]]
The city of Exeter was established on the eastern bank of the [[River Exe]] on a ridge of land backed by a steep hill. It is at this point that the Exe, having just been joined by the [[River Creedy]], opens onto a wide [[flood plain]] and estuary which results in quite common flooding. Historically this was the [[lowest bridging point]] of the River Exe which was tidal and navigable up to the city until the construction of weirs later in its history. This combined with the easily defensible higher ground of the ridge made the current location of the city a natural choice for settlement and trade. In [[George Oliver (historian)|George Oliver]]'s ''The History of the City of Exeter'', it is noted that the most likely reasons for the original settling of what would become modern Exeter was the "fertility of the surrounding countryside" and the area's "beautiful and commanding elevation [and] its rapid and navigable river".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Oliver |first=George |title=History of the City of Exeter |year=1861 |isbn=0-217-79997-3 |page=1}}</ref>
Its woodland would also have been ideal for natural resources and hunting.

Exeter sits predominantly on sandstone and conglomerate geology, although the structure of the surrounding areas is varied.<ref>{{Cite web |last=DEFRA |title=Southwest EDRP Geographical Area and Physical Context |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/erdp/docs/swchapter/section11/topography.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113123623/http://www.defra.gov.uk/erdp/docs/swchapter/section11/topography.htm |archive-date=13 November 2008 |access-date=13 July 2008}}</ref>
The topography of the ridge which forms the backbone of the city includes a [[volcanic plug]], on which the [[Rougemont Castle]] is situated. The cathedral is located on the edge of this ridge and is therefore visible for a considerable distance.

Exeter is {{cvt|80|mi|km|-1|abbr=off}} west-southwest of [[Salisbury]], {{cvt|158|mi|km}} west-southwest of [[London]], {{cvt|18|mi|km|0}} north of [[Torquay]], {{cvt|36|mi|km|0}} northeast of Plymouth and {{cvt|74|mi|km|0}} east-northeast of [[Truro]].

===Climate===
[[File:Exeter_Cathedral_Green_after_snowfall,_180123.png|thumb|right|The Cathedral Green after a rare snowfall]]

Exeter has mild wet winters, punctuated by colder spells that are usually short-lived. Summer is characterised by warm and changeable weather with hot and cooler rainy spells. Temperatures do not vary much throughout the year compared to other locations at this latitude; however, the topography of Exeter can enhance the diurnal range by a couple degrees Celsius, as spots along the sheltered valley of the River Exe such as Quayside, St Thomas and Exwick see colder nights and warmer days, the only exception to this is with foggy and frosty weather in the winter during anticyclonic activity when fog can linger all day and keep daytime temperatures suppressed.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} Similarly, the same weather patterns can elevate the maximum daily temperatures, The hottest month is July with an average high of {{cvt|21.7|C|F}}, and the coldest month is January with an average high of {{cvt|8.8|C|F}}. October is the wettest month with {{cvt|88.9|mm|in}} of rain. The weather station for these reading is at Exeter Airport; adding one degree Celsius to the readings from the maximum daily temperature and deducting a degree from the overnight minima broadly covers the location disparity.{{citation needed|date=August 2024}} It is precisely because of shelter from [[Dartmoor]] that Exeter is more frost-prone than areas to the southwest, such as [[Plymouth]]. It is also drier and warmer in the summer for the same reason.

The [[Met Office]], the main weather forecasting organisation for the United Kingdom and one of the most significant in the world, relocated from [[Bracknell]] in Berkshire to Exeter in early 2004. It is one of the largest employers in the area (together with the [[University of Exeter]], [[Devon County Council]] and the [[Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust]]).

The city centre provides substantial shopping facilities. The High Street is mainly devoted to branches of national chains: a [[New Economics Foundation|NEF]] survey in 2005 rated Exeter as the worst example of a [[clone town]] in the UK, with only a single independent store in the city's High Street, and less diversity (in terms of different categories of shop) than any other town surveyed. In 2010, a similar survey reported the city was still the worst clone town.<ref>{{Cite news |date=15 September 2010 |title=Traders hit back after 'clone town' attack |work=Western Morning News |url=http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/traders-hit-clone-town-attack/story-11755773-detail/story.html |access-date=15 August 2016}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> As of 2019, the last independent store on the high street is closed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.devonlive.com/farewell-mcgahey-tobacconist-exeter-high-2624009 |title=A farewell to McGahey The Tobacconist: Exeter High Street's last independent |first=Hannah |last=Finch |date=9 March 2019 |website=DevonLive |access-date=4 November 2020 |archive-date=28 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201028201919/https://www.devonlive.com/farewell-mcgahey-tobacconist-exeter-high-2624009 |url-status=live}}</ref> Three significant shopping areas that connect to the High Street provide a somewhat more varied menu. [[Princesshay]], a [[post-war]] retail area connecting to the south side of the High Street was home to a number of independent stores prior to redevelopment in 2007, but is now also largely occupied by national chains. It is still intended that a number of the new units will be let to local independent stores.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The [[House of Fraser]] building on the high street has been bought by a local wealth performance management firm, Prydis, who have released their plans to redevelop the building as a three-storey hotel with a rooftop bar and retail shops.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Smith |first=Colleen |date=2019-04-10 |title=First pictures of House of Fraser plans show dramatic rooftop bar |url=https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/first-pictures-house-fraser-plans-2743509 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411161754/https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/first-pictures-house-fraser-plans-2743509 |archive-date=11 April 2019 |access-date=2019-11-05 |website=devonlive}}</ref>

On the other side of the High Street, the partly-undercover Guildhall Shopping Centre houses a mixture of national and more regional shops, and connects to the wholly enclosed Harlequins Centre where smaller businesses predominate. Smaller streets off the High Street such as Gandy Street also offer a range of independent shops.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Independent Shopping on Gandy Street - Visit Exeter|url=https://www.visitexeter.com/inspire-me/blog/read/2017/11/independent-shopping-on-gandy-street-b220|access-date=2022-01-20|website=www.visitexeter.com}}</ref>

Although Exeter contains a number of tourist attractions, the city is not dominated by tourism, with only 7% of employment dependent on tourism compared with 13% for Devon as a whole (2005 figures).<ref>[http://www.tourisminsights.info/STATISTICS/STAT1.HTML South West Tourism (2006)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420021523/http://www.tourisminsights.info/STATISTICS/STAT1.HTML |date=20 April 2009}}, ''The Value of Tourism in Devon 2005''.

There are also plans to build on land in the Teignbridge and East Devon areas, which border Exeter's boundaries, as part of the "Exeter Growth Point" strategy.

Among the notable buildings in Exeter are:

===Religious buildings===
{{See also|Exeter#Religion}}
[[File:ExeterCathedral-4.jpg|thumb|[[Exeter Cathedral]] and the [[Devon County War Memorial]]]]
* The [[Exeter Cathedral|cathedral]], founded in 1050 when the bishop's seat was moved from the nearby town of [[Crediton]] (birthplace of [[Saint Boniface]]) because Exeter's Roman walls offered better protection against "pirates", presumably [[Viking]]s. A statue of [[Richard Hooker (theologian)|Richard Hooker]], the 16th century [[Anglican]] theologian, who was born in Exeter, has a prominent place in the [[Cathedral Close, Exeter|Cathedral Close]].
* [[St Nicholas Priory]] in Mint Lane, the remains of a [[monastery]], later used as a private house and now a museum owned by the city council. The priory was founded in medieval times and was home to Benedictine monks for over 400 years, until it was closed and partly demolished by [[Henry VIII]]. The remaining buildings were then sold off in 1602 and became the home of the locally wealthy Hurst family. The property has been fully renovated by Exeter City Council, and the small garden area features Tudor plants and herbs<ref>''St Nicholas Priory: Discover a Tudor Home'' Booklet produced by Exeter City Council (July 2009)</ref>
* A number of medieval churches including [[Church of St Mary Steps, Exeter|St Mary Steps]] which has an elaborate clock.
* The [[Exeter Synagogue]] is the third oldest synagogue in Britain, completed in 1763.
* [[St Thomas, Exeter#Parish Church of St Thomas the Apostle|St Thomas' Church]], originally built in the 13th century just outside the city walls. Destroyed by fire and rebuilt in the 17th century; grade I listed.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1169954|desc=Church of St Thomas |access-date=4 January 2019}}</ref>

===Secular buildings and features===
[[File:The House that Moved in Exeter - geograph.org.uk - 1727313.jpg|thumb|upright|"[[The House That Moved]]", West Street, Exeter]]
* The [[ruins]] of [[Rougemont Castle]]; later parts of the castle were still in use by the Crown Court and the County Court until 2004 when the new [[Exeter Law Courts]] opened. A plaque near the surviving medieval gatehouse recalls the fate of [[Alice Molland]], tried for [[witchcraft]] at Exeter in 1685, and reputedly the last person in England to have been executed for that crime; others convicted of witchcraft had been hanged in Exeter in 1581, 1610, and 1682.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Stoyle |first=Mark |date=April 2011 |title=It is but an old wytche gonne': Prosecution and Execution for Witchcraft in Exeter, 1558-1610 |journal=History |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=129–51 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-229X.2011.00511.x}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Sharpe |first=James |title=Instruments of Darkness: Witchcraft in England, 1550-1750 |date=1996 |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |location=London |page=121}}</ref>

* The [[Custom House, Exeter|Custom House]] in the [[Exeter Quay|Quay area]], which is the oldest brick building surviving in the city.
* "[[The House That Moved]]", a 14th-century [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] building, earned its name in 1961 when it was moved from its original location on the corner of Edmund Street in order for a new road to be built in its place. Weighing more than twenty-one tonnes, it was strapped together and slowly moved a few inches at a time to its present-day position.
* [[Parliament Street, Exeter|Parliament Street]] in the city centre is one of the narrowest streets in the world.
* The [[Butts Ferry]], an ancient [[cable ferry]] across the River Exe.

===Northernhay Gardens===
Located just outside the castle, [[Northernhay Gardens]] is the oldest public open space in England, being originally laid out in 1612 as a pleasure walk for Exeter residents.

==Transport==

===Car===
[[File:M5 Bridge crosses the River Exe - geograph.org.uk - 1109085.jpg|thumb|Bridge carrying the [[M5 motorway]] across the [[River Exe]]]]
The [[M5 motorway]] to [[Bristol]] and Exeter starts at [[Birmingham]], and connects at Bristol with the [[M4 motorway|M4]] to London and [[South Wales]]. The older [[A30 road]] provides a more direct route to London via the [[A303 road|A303]] and [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3]], and a non-motorway route to Bristol via the A303 and [[A37 road|A37]]. The M5 is the modern lowest bridging point of the [[River Exe]]. Going westwards, the [[A38 road|A38]] connects Exeter to [[Plymouth]] and south east [[Cornwall]], whilst the A30 continues via [[Okehampton]] to Cornwall and ends at [[Penzance]]. The cities of [[Bristol]], [[Plymouth]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Salisbury]] and [[Truro]] can all be reached within two hours.

Travel by car in the city is often difficult with regular jams centred on the Exe Bridges area.{{citation needed|reason=The surrounding references don't support this as a current statement|date=October 2024}} Historically, the bridges were a significant bottleneck for holiday traffic heading to southwest England, leading to the construction of the first bypass in the mid-1930s over [[Countess Wear|Countess Wear Bridge]], followed by the M5 in 1977.<ref name="dcc">{{Cite web |date=24 March 2016 |title=The changing face of Bridge Road in Exeter |url=https://www.devonnewscentre.info/the-changing-face-of-bridge-road-in-exeter/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012100749/https://www.devonnewscentre.info/the-changing-face-of-bridge-road-in-exeter/ |archive-date=12 October 2016 |access-date=15 August 2016 |publisher=Devon County Council}}</ref> To further address the problem of congestion in the city centre, [[Devon County Council]] opened three [[park and ride]] sites, and in 2006 considered the introduction of [[congestion charge]]s.<ref>{{Cite news |date=7 November 2006 |title=Drivers facing congestion charge |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/6125042.stm |url-status=live |access-date=13 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216082313/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/6125042.stm |archive-date=16 February 2007}}</ref>{{update inline|reason=Any developments since 2006?|date=October 2024}}

===Bus===
Exeter's main operator of local buses is [[Stagecoach South West]], which operates most of the services in the city. [[Go-Ahead Group#Bus operations|Dartline Coaches]] is a minor operator in the city. Former operator Cooks Coaches were taken over by [[Stagecoach Devon|Stagecoach]] forming Stagecoach South West. [[Western Greyhound]] was also a main operator connecting Exeter to [[Cornwall]] until its services were taken over by [[First South West|First Devon & Cornwall]], [[Plymouth Citybus]] and Stagecoach South West in March 2015.<ref>[https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/council-news-room/media-releases/news-from-2015/news-from-march-2015/replacement-western-greyhound-bus-services-running-from-monday-16-march/ "Replacement Western Greyhound services running from Monday 16th March"] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192212/https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/council-news-room/media-releases/news-from-2015/news-from-march-2015/replacement-western-greyhound-bus-services-running-from-monday-16-march/ |date=4 March 2016 }} Cornwall Council 17 March 2015</ref> On July 25, 2021, the new [[Exeter bus station|bus station]] opened.

===Railway===
[[File:2008 at Exeter St Davids - station frontage.jpg|thumb|Exeter St Davids Railway Station]]

Exeter is a major rail hub in the South West and is linked to most branch lines in Devon, including to [[Riviera Line|Paignton]], [[Avocet Line|Exmouth]], [[Tarka Line|Barnstaple]] and [[Okehampton]]. This makes it possible to reach most stations in Devon directly from [[Exeter St Davids railway station|Exeter St Davids]].

Exeter is served by three main railway stations. [[Exeter St Davids railway station|Exeter St Davids]] is served by all services and is a major [[interchange station]] within the [[South West Peninsula]]'s rail network, whilst [[Exeter Central railway station|Exeter Central]] is more convenient for the city centre but served only by local services and the main line route to [[London Waterloo station|London Waterloo.]] In the south-west of the city, [[Exeter St Thomas railway station|Exeter St Thomas]] serves the western side of the city. There are also seven suburban stations, [[Topsham railway station|Topsham]], [[St James Park railway station|St James Park]], [[Polsloe Bridge railway station|Polsloe Bridge]], [[Pinhoe railway station|Pinhoe]], [[Digby and Sowton railway station|Digby & Sowton]], [[Marsh Barton railway station|Marsh Barton]] and [[Newcourt (Exeter) railway station|Newcourt]], served only by local services. Under the ongoing [[Devon Metro]] scheme, a gradual upgrade programme is underway to bring a [[rapid transit]]-style service on Exeter's [[Urban rail in the United Kingdom|local rail]] network using these existing commuter lines.

There are two main line railway routes from Exeter to London, the faster [[Reading to Taunton line|route via Taunton and Reading to London Paddington]] and the slower [[West of England Main Line]] via [[Salisbury, England|Salisbury]] and [[Basingstoke]] to [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]]. Another main line, the [[Cross Country Route]], links Exeter with [[Bristol]], [[Birmingham]], [[Derby]], [[Leeds]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[Aberdeen]]. [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]] and [[CrossCountry]] services continue westwards along the [[Exeter to Plymouth Line]], variously serving [[Torquay]], [[Plymouth]] and [[Cornwall]]. Local branch lines run to [[Paignton]] (see [[Riviera Line]]), [[Exmouth, Devon|Exmouth]] (see [[Avocet Line]]), [[Barnstaple]] (see [[Tarka Line]]) and [[Okehampton]] (see [[Dartmoor Line]]).

The [[Exeter to Plymouth railway of the LSWR|Exeter to Plymouth line of the London and South Western Railway (LSWR)]] used to provide an alternative route via [[Okehampton]] connecting north [[Cornwall]] and [[Plymouth]] to Exeter and the rest of the UK railway system until its closure in 1968. There are proposals to reopen the line from Okehampton via Tavistock to Bere Alston, for a through service to Plymouth.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Harris |first=Nigel |year=2008 |title=Taking trains back to Tavistock |journal=Rail |publisher=Bauer |issue=590 |pages=40–45}}</ref> On the night of 4 February 2014, amid high winds and extremely rough seas, part of the [[South Devon Railway sea wall]] at Dawlish was breached, washing away around {{cvt|40|m}} of the wall and the ballast under the railway immediately behind and closing the [[Exeter to Plymouth Line]].

===Air===
[[File:ExeterAirportUK.jpg|thumb|Exeter International Airport]]
[[Exeter Airport]] lies east of the city, and the local airline, previously called [[Jersey European]] and [[British European]] but later as [[Flybe (1979–2020)|Flybe]], was a significant local employer until its collapse in 2020. It is also a base for [[TUI Airways]] with flights to [[Faro Airport|Faro]], [[Mallorca]], [[Lanzarote]] and elsewhere. The airport offers a range of scheduled flights to British and Irish regional airports and [[Charter airline|charter]] flights. Connections to international hubs began with [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle]] in 2005 and later a daily service to [[Amsterdam Schiphol Airport]] which ended with the collapse of Flybe in 2020. [[Ryanair]] started flights in 2019 to Luqa, Naples and Málaga. Shortly adding Alicante but stopping the Naples and Luqa flights.

===Canal===
[[File:Exeter Canal Basin - geograph.org.uk - 238695.jpg|thumb|Exeter Canal Basin]]
The [[Exeter Canal]], also known as the Exeter Ship Canal, was first constructed by John Trew in about 1566,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Clew |first=Kenneth R. |title=The Exeter Canal |publisher=Phillimore |year=1984 |isbn=0-85033-544-2 |location=Chichester}}</ref> representing one of the oldest artificial waterways in Britain. It was cut to bypass the St James' Weir that had been built across the [[River Exe]] at Duckes Marsh to provide a leat to a mill constructed just below the confluence of the Northbrook, in what became the village of Countess Weir. The weir had the effect of preventing water-borne trade in the City of Exeter and forced boats to load and unload at [[Topsham, Devon|Topsham]] from where the [[Earl of Devon|Earls of Devon]] were able to exact large tolls to transport goods to and from Exeter.

Originally {{cvt|3|ft|m|1|abbr=off|spell=in}} deep and {{cvt|16|ft|m|0|abbr=off}} wide, the canal ran {{cvt|2|mi|km|0|spell=on|abbr=off}} from the confluence of the Matford Brook, just above Bridge Road in [[Countess Wear|Countess Weir]] to Haven Banks, close to the centre of Exeter. In order to maintain a consistent navigable water level, another weir was constructed by Trew, just below the point the canal joins the river. The canal was later extended south to Topsham Lock {{cvt|3+21/32|mi|km|2|abbr=off}}, deepened and widened, and later still it was extended to Turf Lock near [[Manor of Powderham|Powderham]] {{cvt|5|mi|km|0|abbr=off|spell=on}}. The canal was successful until the middle of the 19th century since when its use gradually declined – the last commercial use was in 1972. However it is now widely used for leisure purposes, and the city basin is part of a £24&nbsp;million redevelopment scheme.

==Education==
{{See also|List of schools in Devon}}
[[File:Laver Building, University of Exeter - geograph.org.uk - 148746.jpg|thumb|upright|Laver Building, University of Exeter]]
The [[University of Exeter]], which has two campuses in the city, includes the [[University of Exeter Business School|Business School]], the [[Bill Douglas Cinema Museum]], the [[Henry Wellcome]] building for Biocatalysis, and, as of September 2018, the Exeter Centre for [[Ellen MacArthur Foundation|Circular Economy]].

[[Exeter College, Exeter|Exeter College]] is a [[further education]] college. It previously operated as the sole [[sixth form]] for the entire [[maintained school]] sector in the city. However, in 2014 [[Exeter Mathematics School]] was established, a [[Free school (England)|free school]] sixth form with a specialism in Mathematics.

For about 30 years the city of Exeter operated a [[maintained school]] system in which the divisions between phases came at different ages from most of the United Kingdom, with first, middle and high rather than infant, junior and secondary schools, so that children transferred between schools at the age of about 8 and 12 rather than 7 and 11.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} From 2005, however, it has adopted the more usual pattern, because of the pressures of the UK [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]]. The changeover back to the more typical structure led to a citywide, [[Private Finance Initiative|PFI]] funded, rebuilding programme for the high schools and led to the changing of names for some schools. Following the reorganisation there are 25 primary schools, four referral schools, three [[special school]]s and five secondary schools within Exeter.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Schools, locations and details |url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/index/learning/schools/locations_and_details.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704151841/http://www.devon.gov.uk/index/learning/schools/locations_and_details.htm |archive-date=4 July 2008 |access-date=19 July 2008 |website=Devon County Council website}}</ref> The secondary schools are [[Isca Academy]] (formerly Priory High School), [[St James School, Exeter|St James School]] (formerly St James High School), [[St Luke's Church of England School]] (formerly Vincent Thompson High School), [[St Peter's Church of England Aided School]] (a consolidation of the former Bishop Blackall High School for Girls and Heles High School for Boys) and [[West Exe School]] (formerly St Thomas High School).

The city has a number of independent schools, including [[Exeter School]], [[Exeter Cathedral School]], [[The Maynard School]] and [[St Wilfrid's School, Exeter|St Wilfrid's School]].

There are specialist schools for pupils with sensory needs, including Exeter Royal Academy for Deaf Education, and the West of England School for the Partially Sighted.

==Religion==
[[File:St Michael's church, and Episcopal building, Exeter - geograph.org.uk - 287157.jpg|thumb|upright|St Michael's Church and Episcopal Building]]
Numerous churches, and other religious buildings, are present in Exeter. A majority belong to differing Christian denominations, including a [[Church of England]] cathedral. The medieval city of Exeter had nearly 70 churches, chapels, monasteries and almshouses.<ref>Nicholas Orme ''The Churches of Medieval Exeter''. Exeter: Impress Books, 2014; back cover</ref>

[[Exeter Cathedral]] is the seat of the [[Bishop of Exeter]]. The erection of the present building was completed in approximately 1400, and possesses the longest uninterrupted vaulted ceiling in England, as well as other noticeable characteristics. A collective of Anglican churches form the [[Deanery of Christianity (Exeter)|Exeter Deanery]].

There are two Catholic Churches: the [[Sacred Heart Church, Exeter|Sacred Heart]] and the Blessed Sacrament, with congregations reflecting the nature of older and more recent immigration.

[[Exeter Synagogue]], located within a near proximity to Mary Arches Street, was completely erected in 1763.

[[Exeter Mosque|Exeter's mosque and Islamic centre]] are located on York Road. The first mosque was opened in 1977.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Telling our stories, finding our roots Exeter Multicultural History – Timeline |url=http://www.tellingourstoriesexeter.org.uk/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&cntnt01articleid=18&cntnt01origid=57&cntnt01returnid=80 |access-date=2019-11-29 |website=www.tellingourstoriesexeter.org.uk |archive-date=21 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200521234036/http://www.tellingourstoriesexeter.org.uk/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&cntnt01articleid=18&cntnt01origid=57&cntnt01returnid=80 |url-status=live}}</ref> The purpose-built mosque opened in 2011.

At the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]], 69.12% of Exeter's population stated their religion as Christian, which is mildly lower than the regional average of 73.99% and the national average of 71.74%. Despite this, all other religions had exceeded the regional average at just under 1%. Although, they were much lower than the national average with the exemption of Buddhism. 20.45% of Exeter's population stated they had no religion, which was higher than the regional average of 16.75% and the national average of 14.59%.<ref>{{Cite web |date=1 April 2001 |title=Religion |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=276927&c=Exeter&d=13&e=15&g=436252&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1231680745917&enc=1&dsFamilyId=17 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613050407/http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=276927&c=Exeter&d=13&e=15&g=436252&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1231680745917&enc=1&dsFamilyId=17 |archive-date=13 June 2011 |access-date=11 January 2009 |website=[[United Kingdom Census 2001]] |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]]}}</ref>

===Anglican churches===
[[File:St David's church, Exeter - geograph.org.uk - 213553.jpg|thumb|[[St David's Church, Exeter]]]]
[[John Betjeman]] (writing in 1958) selects [[St David's Church, Exeter|St David's]] ("[[W. D. Caroe|Caroe]]'s best church"), [[St Martin's Church, Exeter|St Martin's]] ("characteristic little city church, 15th century"), [[Church of St Mary Steps, Exeter|St Mary Steps]] ("medieval city church; font"), St Michael's ("Victorian, on a fine site"), and St Thomas's ("fittings"). His coverage of St Mary Arches is more detailed: "worth seeing ... as the completest Norman church in Devon: beautifully light and airy after its restoration from the bombing in 1942. 18th-century altar arrangements. Memorials to Exeter worthies, 16th to 18th centuries."<ref>Betjeman, John, ed. (1968) ''Collins Pocket Guide to English Parish Churches; the South''. London: Collins; p. 164</ref>

The aforementioned collective of Anglican churches include St David's Church, located near to St David's Station. The church was envisaged by [[W. D. Caroe]], with the windows being manufactured by Kempe & Tower, and was later constructed between 1897 and 1900. A tower stands on the northeast side, with the overall design being described as "highly picturesque" by Nikolaus Pevsner.

St Edmund-on-the-Bridge was built on the Exe Bridge {{Circa|1230–40}}. Two arches of the bridge remain under the undercroft though the church was rebuilt in the Perpendicular style in 1835, using the old materials.

St Martin's is in the [[Cathedral Close]]; the plan is odd, and there are numerous items of church furniture, though these are not of high aesthetic value. St Mary Arches is a Norman church with aisles. St Mary Steps was originally by the West Gate of the city; the font is Norman, and there is a remarkable early clock. St Michael, Heavitree was built in 1844–46 and extended later in the century. [[St Pancras Church, Exeter|St Pancras]] is of the 13th century and has a nave and chancel only; the font is Norman. The plan of [[St Petrocks Church, Exeter|St Petroc's]] church is highly unusual: a second chancel has been added facing north while the original chancel has another use and faces east. There are two aisles on the south, one of 1413 and another of the 16th century.

St Sidwell's church is by W. Burgess, 1812, in the Perpendicular style. [[St Stephens Church, Exeter|St Stephen's church]] is partly of the 13th century but most of the structure is as rebuilt in 1826.<ref>Pevsner, N. (1952) ''South Devon''. Harmondsworth: Penguin Books; pp. 148–53</ref> [[St Michael and All Angels Church, Exeter|St Michael and All Angels Church]] on Mount Dinham has a spire which exceeds the height of the towers of Exeter Cathedral.

The ''[[Exeter Book]]'', an anthology of Anglo Saxon poetry, is conserved in the vaults of Exeter Cathedral. The Exeter Book originates from the 10th century and is one of four manuscripts that between them encompass all surviving poetry composed in [[Old English language|Old English]]. Predominantly, the Book incorporates shorter poems, several religious pieces, and a series of [[riddle]]s, a handful of which are famously [[lewd]]. Some of these riddles are inscribed on a highly polished steel obelisk in High Street, placed there on 30 March 2005.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/news_features/2005/riddles_statue.shtml The Riddle of the new Exeter Statue] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504020912/http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/news_features/2005/riddles_statue.shtml |date=4 May 2008 }} (retrieved 19 November 2010)</ref>
