==History==
Koga was settled in the  [[Jōmon period]] and already known as a ferry port on the Watarase River in the [[Nara period]] and is mentioned in the ''[[Man'yōshū]]''. During the [[Heian period]] it was the site of an iron smelter and kilns for production of ceramics and roof tiles and was one of the largest centers for iron production in eastern Japan . During the [[Muromachi period]] it was the location of the [[Kantō kubō|Koga kubō]], a secondary government created by the [[Ashikaga shogunate]] to rule eastern Japan. In the [[Sengoku period]], it developed into a [[jōkamachi|castle town]] and during the [[Edo period]] became the seat of the ''[[daimyō]]'' of [[Koga Domain]] under the [[Edo period]] [[Tokugawa shogunate]] and a [[shukuba|station]] on the [[Nikkō Kaidō]] highway.

The town of Koga was established on April 1, 1889, with the creation of the modern municipalities system. It was raised to city status on August 1, 1950. On September 12, 2005, Koga absorbed the towns of [[Sanwa, Ibaraki|Sanwa]] and [[Sōwa, Ibaraki|Sōwa]] (both from [[Sashima District, Ibaraki|Sashima District]]) to create the new and expanded city of Koga. The new city hall is now located at the former town of Sōwa.

==Government==
Koga has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 24 members. Koga contributes three members to the Ibaraki Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of [[Ibaraki 7th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Koga was known in the [[Meiji era]] through the prewar [[Shōwa era]] as a center for [[sericulture]]. At present, the economy is highly industrialized, with the number of factories as second within Ibaraki Prefecture, after [[Hitachi, Ibaraki|Hitachi city]].

==Education==
Koga  has 23 public elementary schools and nine public middle schools operated by the city government, and five public high schools operated by the Ibaraki Prefectural Board of Education. In addition, there is one private high school.
