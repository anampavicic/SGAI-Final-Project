Omaha's pioneer period began in 1854, when the city was founded by speculators from neighboring [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]]. The city was founded along the Missouri River, and a crossing called [[Lone Tree Ferry]] earned the city its nickname, the "Gateway to the West". Omaha introduced this new West to the world in 1898, when it played host to the World's Fair, dubbed the [[Trans-Mississippi Exposition]]. During the 19th century, Omaha's central location in the United States spurred the city to become an important national [[Transportation in Omaha|transportation hub]]. Throughout the rest of the 19th century, the transportation and [[Wholesale|jobbing]] sectors were important in the city, along with its [[Railroads in Omaha|railroads]] and [[Brewery|breweries]]. In the 20th century, the [[Omaha Stockyards]], once the world's largest, and its [[meatpacking]] plants gained international prominence.

Various [[Native American tribes in Nebraska|Native American tribes]] had lived in the land that became Omaha since the 17th century, including the [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]] and [[Ponca]], [[Dhegihan languages|Dhegihan-Siouan language]] people who had originated in the lower [[Ohio River]] valley and migrated west by the early 17th century; [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]], [[Otoe tribe|Otoe]], [[Missouri (tribe)|Missouri]], and [[Ioway]]. The word ''Omaha'' (actually ''Umoⁿhoⁿ'' or ''Umaⁿhaⁿ'') in the Omaha language means "Upstream People" or "Against the Current".

In 1804 the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] passed the riverbanks where the city of Omaha would be built. Between July 30 and August 3, 1804, members of the expedition, including [[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]], met with Oto and Missouria tribal leaders at the [[Council Bluff, Nebraska|Council Bluff]] at a point about {{cvt|20|mi|0|abbr=off|sp=us}} north of present-day Omaha.<ref>(1987) "Fort Atkinson Chronology", ''NEBRASKAland Magazine.'' p. 34–35.</ref> Immediately south of that area, Americans built several fur trading outposts in succeeding years, including [[Fort Lisa (Nebraska)|Fort Lisa]] in 1812;<ref>[[Julius Sterling Morton|Morton, J.

Through 26 separate treaties with the United States federal government, [[Native American tribes in Nebraska]] gradually ceded the lands that now make up the state. The treaty and cession involving the Omaha area occurred in 1854 when the [[Omaha Tribe]] ceded most of east-central Nebraska.<ref>Royce, C.C.

===Pioneer Omaha===
Before it was legal to claim land in [[Indian Country]], [[William D. Brown]] operated the [[Lone Tree Ferry]] that brought settlers from Council Bluffs, Iowa to the area that became Omaha.

The [[economy of Omaha]] boomed and busted through its early years. In 1858, the ''Omaha Daily Republican'' was founded by the ''Omaha Printing Company (rebranded Aradius Group, 2016)'', it was Nebraska's first regional newspaper–founded before Nebraska claimed statehood. Omaha was a stopping point for settlers and prospectors heading west, either overland or by the Missouri River. The steamboat ''[[Bertrand (steamboat)|Bertrand]]'' sank north of Omaha on its way to the goldfields in 1865.

A [[historic preservation]] movement in Omaha has led to a number of historic structures and districts being designated [[Omaha Landmark]]s or listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The [[Jobbers Canyon Historic District]], along the Missouri River, was felled for a new headquarters campus for ConAgra Foods, a company which threatened to relocate if Omaha did not allow them to raze the city's historic district.

As a major industrial city into the mid-20th century, Omaha shared in social tensions that came with rapid growth and the arrival of large numbers of immigrants and migrants. Persistent poverty resulting from racial discrimination and job losses generated different crimes in the late 20th century, with the drug trade and drug abuse becoming associated with violent crime rates, which climbed after 1986 as Los Angeles gangs made affiliates in the city.<ref>Hull, J.

Gambling in Omaha has been an important part of the city's history. From its founding in the 1850s through the 1930s, the city was known as a "wide-open" town where gambling of all sorts was openly accepted. By the 1950s, at the same time large-scale restructuring of the railroads, the meatpacking industry and other sectors caused widespread job losses and unemployment, Omaha reportedly had more illicit gambling than any other city in the nation.<ref>[http://www.netnebraska.org/extras/statewide/pers/transcripts/Omaha%20Gambling%20History.pdf Transcript to "Nebraska's gambling history"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014040343/http://www.netnebraska.org/extras/statewide/pers/transcripts/Omaha%20Gambling%20History.pdf|date=October 14, 2008}}, Nebraska ETV.

As most forms of gambling are currently restricted in Nebraska, gambling in Omaha is limited to [[keno]], [[lottery|lotteries]], and [[parimutuel betting]]. This leaves Omahans to drive across the Missouri River to Council Bluffs, Iowa, where casinos are legal and many businesses operate. Recently, the [[National Indian Gaming Commission]] approved a controversial proposal made by the [[Ponca]] tribe of Nebraska. It will allow the tribe to build a casino in [[Carter Lake, Iowa]], which sits on the west side of the Missouri River, adjacent to Omaha, where casinos are illegal.<ref>[http://www.wowt.com/home/headlines/27078104.html "Pottawattamie County May Join Suit Against Casino: Nebraska trying to stop planned Carter Lake casino"] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107103556/http://www.wowt.com/home/headlines/27078104.html |date=January 7, 2009 }}, [[WOWT]].

[[Native American tribes in Nebraska|Native Americans]] were the first residents of the Omaha area. The city of Omaha was established by white settlers from neighboring Council Bluffs who arrived from the [[Northeastern United States]] a few years earlier. While much of the early population was of [[Yankee]] stock, over the next 100 years numerous [[Ethnic groups in Omaha, Nebraska|ethnic groups]] moved to the city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Omaha's population as 96.4% White and 3.6% Black.<ref>{{cite web |title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |access-date=April 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archive-date=August 12, 2012}}</ref> [[Irish in Omaha, Nebraska|Irish]] immigrants in Omaha originally moved to an area in present-day North Omaha called [[Gophertown]], as they lived in dug-out [[sod house]]s.<ref name="Bristow 2000" /> That population was followed by [[Poles in Omaha, Nebraska|Polish immigrants]] in the [[Sheelytown]] neighborhood, and many immigrants were recruited for jobs in South Omaha's [[Union Stockyards (Omaha)|stockyards]] and meatpacking industry.<ref>Peattie, E.W.

Since its founding, [[Ethnic groups in Omaha, Nebraska|ethnic groups in the city]] have clustered in [[Ethnic enclave|enclaves]] in [[North Omaha, Nebraska|north]], [[South Omaha, Nebraska|south]] and [[downtown Omaha]].

In the early 20th century, [[Jews and Judaism in Omaha, Nebraska|Jewish]] immigrants set up many businesses along the [[North 24th Street]] commercial area. It suffered with the loss of industrial jobs in the 1960s and, later, the shifting of population west of the city. The commercial area is now the center of the [[African Americans in Omaha, Nebraska|African-American community]], concentrated in North Omaha.<ref>(1980) ''A Comprehensive Program for Historic Preservation in Omaha'', [[Government of Omaha|City of Omaha]] [[Landmarks Heritage Preservation Commission]]. p. 54.</ref> The African American community has maintained its social and religious base, while it is experiencing an economic revitalization.

With the expansion of railroad and industrial jobs in meatpacking, Omaha attracted many immigrants and migrants.

Six years after the Greek Town Riot, in 1915, a mob killed Juan Gonzalez, a Mexican immigrant, near [[Scribner, Nebraska|Scribner]], a town in the Greater Omaha metropolitan area. The event occurred after an [[Omaha Police Department]] officer investigated a criminal operation that sold goods stolen from the nearby railroad yards. [[Racial profiling]] targeted Gonzalez as the culprit. After escaping the city, he was trapped along the [[Elkhorn River]], where the mob, including several policemen from Omaha, shot him more than twenty times. It was discovered Gonzalez was unarmed, and he had a reliable alibi for the time of the murder. No one was ever indicted for his killing.<ref>De La Garza, M. (2004) "The Lynching of Juan Gonzalez", ''Nebraska History.'' 85. (Spring). p. 24–35.</ref>

In the fall of 1919, following [[Red Summer]], postwar social and economic tensions, the earlier hiring of African Americans as strikebreakers, and job uncertainty contributed to a mob from South Omaha lynching [[Willy Brown]] and the ensuing [[Omaha Race Riot of 1919|Omaha Race Riot]]. Trying to defend Brown, the city's mayor, [[Edward Parsons Smith]], was lynched also, surviving only after a quick rescue.<ref name="Bristow 2000" />

Like other industrial cities in the U.S., Omaha suffered severe job losses in the 1950s, more than 10,000 in all, as the railroad and meatpacking industries restructured. Stockyards and packing plants were located closer to ranches, and union achievements were lost as wages declined in surviving jobs.<ref>Cordes, H.J. [https://web.archive.org/web/20071107070423/http://www.omaha.com/index.php?u_page=2798&u_sid=10176422 "Decline in industrial jobs hurts blacks"] ''Omaha World-Herald''. November 5, 2007. Retrieved 9/23/08.</ref> Many workers left the area if they could get to other jobs. Poverty deepened in areas of the city whose residents depended on those jobs, specifically North and South Omaha. At the same time, with reduced revenues, the city had less financial ability to respond to longstanding problems.

Despair after the April 1968 [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]] contributed to [[King assassination riots|riots in North Omaha]], including one at the [[Logan Fontenelle Housing Project]].<ref>Luebtke, F.C. (2005) ''Nebraska: An Illustrated History.'' University of Nebraska Press. p. 334.</ref> For some, the [[civil rights movement in Omaha, Nebraska]] evolved towards [[black nationalism]], as the [[Black Panther Party]] was involved in tensions in the late 1960s. Organizations such as the [[Black Association for Nationalism Through Unity]] became popular among the city's African-American youth. This tension culminated in the ''[[cause célèbre]]'' trial of the [[Rice/Poindexter Case]], in which an [[Omaha Police Department]] officer was killed by a bomb while answering an emergency call.
