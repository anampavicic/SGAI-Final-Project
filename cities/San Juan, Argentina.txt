'''San Juan''' ({{IPA|es|saŋ ˈxwan}}) is the capital and largest city of the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[San Juan Province (Argentina)|San Juan]] in the [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]] region, located in the Tulúm Valley, west of the [[San Juan River (Argentina)|San Juan River]], at {{convert|650|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}  [[above mean sea level]], with a population of around 112,000 as per the {{census-ar|2001}} (over 500,000 in the [[metropolitan area]]).

It is a modern city with wide streets and well-drawn avenues with wide sidewalks and vegetation of different species of trees irrigated by canals, from which it derives its nickname ''oasis town''.

It has an important accommodation infrastructure and [[transportation]]. It highlights modern buildings and the surroundings, the reservoir and Ullum dam, spas, museums, large plantations of vines, and various types of agriculture, with [[wine]] being the most important.

== History and architecture ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
Before the arrival of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish]] [[Conquistador]]es, the [[Huarpe]] Indians inhabited this area.

'''San Juan de la Frontera''' was founded on June 13, 1562, by [[Juan Jufré]] at the shore of the San Juan River. In 1593 flooding damaged the town, for which reason its setting was moved {{convert|2.5|km}} south to its current location.
[[File:Ciudad de San Juan Argentina 1894.jpg|left|thumb|Downtown San Juan, around 1910.]]
San Juan was a sleepy, provincial town during colonial times (1562–1810) and took practically no part in the internal wars that devastated [[Argentina]] in its so-called ''Organizational Period'' (1820–1860.) Two of the most prominent members of the 1816 [[Congress of Tucumán]] which declared Argentina's independence from [[Spain]], however, came from San Juán: [[Francisco Narciso de Laprida]], who was president of the congress, and San Juan's bishop Friar [[Justo Santa María de Oro]], a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]] and an eloquent speaker whose persuasive oratory was largely responsible for Argentina becoming a republic and not a [[monarchy]] like [[Brazil]].

Probably the most important and famous city son was Fray Justo's nephew, and president of Argentina between 1868 and 1874, [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]], whose birthplace was turned into a National Historical Monument in 1910, during the administration of [[president of Argentina|president]] [[Roque Sáenz Peña]].
[[Image:Terremoto San Juan 001.jpg|thumb|right|1944 San Juan earthquake]]

On January 15, 1944, [[1944 San Juan earthquake|a powerful earthquake]] devastated the city, killing around 10,000 people and leaving half of the provincial population homeless. [[1977 San Juan earthquake|Another quake]], 7.4 on the [[Richter magnitude scale]], struck 80&nbsp;km northeast of the city on November 23, 1977, causing considerable damage and killing 65 people around the province.

After the disaster of 1944, the city was reconstructed on concentric boulevards, with straight, well-lit, tree-lined avenues and modern housing. It has mostly lost its colonial aspect, but retains an open, sunny Mediterranean look.

==Geography==
The city of San Juan is located in a fertile valley within a rocky mountainous area. Winter temperatures are generally mild, averaging between {{convert|1|C|F|1}} and {{convert|16|C|F|1}}, but can drop below {{convert|-9|C|F|1}}. Summers are hot, with average temperatures between {{convert|19|C|F|1}} and {{convert|35|C|F|1}}, and a record maximum of {{convert|46.7|C|F|1}} on December 20, 1995.<ref name = ORA>

Since very little rain falls in the region, the San Juan River has been dammed to provide a regular source of water to the city. The resulting [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]] is located in [[Ullum]], and is known as the [[Quebrada de Ullum Dam]]. The dam also provides electrical power to the region.

Sixty-five percent of the surrounding area's agricultural production is related to [[Argentine wine|wine production]].

== Urban aspect ==

The city of San Juan completely changed its appearance from a colonial one to one of the most modern in the country after the earthquake of 1944, with well-drawn and wide paved streets, ample sidewalks of tiles or mosaics, and lined with acacias, moreras and paradise trees irrigated by quaint canals.
[[File:Monumento a Sarmiento en San Juan Argentina (EagLau--2008).jpg|thumb|Monument to President Domingo Sarmiento]][[File:Monumento a Antonino Aberastain San Juan Argentina (EagLau--2008).jpg|thumb|Monument to Governor Antonino Aberastain]]
The city is located within the Capital District, which was planned in the form of a checkerboard anchored by Las Heras Avenue (from North to South), 25 de Mayo Av. (East to West), 9 de Julio Av. (east to west) and Guillermo Rawson Avenue (north to south). These four avenues form a perfect rectangle of 16 blocks in width (going from east to west and vice versa -horizontally-) by 10 blocks long (going up and down or North to South, and vice versa). This center of this rectangle is a square of 7 blocks in length by 6 blocks wide, delimited by Leandro N. Alem, Córdoba, Libertador San Martín and Rioja Avenues. This area is the city's downtown and, as such, is the most densely populated and concentrates most of the city's commercial, financial and institutional activities.

The most important perpendicular avenues are Mitre (known for its cinemas and [[cyber café]]s), José Ignacio de la Roza (built after the 1944 earthquake), commercial Santa Fe Avenue, Rivadavia street (the easternmost two blocks of which have been pedestrianized), and San Martín Avenue (which leads to most access routes towards Greater San Juan). The more important parallel arteries are Mendoza Avenue (leading to [[Villa Krause]]), General [[Mariano Acha]] Av. and Rioja Avenue.

Some of the city's most important landmarks are:

*'''Cathedral'''
Designed by architect Daniel Ramos Correa, the cathedral was inaugurated on December 16, 1979. {{citation needed|date=July 2013}} The bell tower is a steeple of 51 meters (170&nbsp;feet) in height, and features a British clock and a German carillon which sounds every 15 minutes. The interior is accessed through a bronze vestibule crafted [[Faenza]], [[Italy]] with bas-reliefs of [[Saint Rose of Lima]], Saint Louis of France, the Apostle Santiago, Saint Anne and several shields and emblems. In the basement of the church is the crypt, the pantheon of the bishops and the chapel of Friar [[Justo Santa María de Oro]].

*'''25 May Park''' 
This is the city's principal urban park, providing a green space with a colorful variety of flora. The park also features 19th century-era monuments to President [[Domingo Sarmiento]] and Friar [[Justo Santa María de Oro]]. The central fountain, dating from 1871, was remodeled on several occasions.

*'''Aberastain Park'''
Named for a former governor, the park features a monument to its namesake (Antonio Aberastain).

*'''Peatonal Tucumán and Rivadavia'''
The city's most important, pedestrianized streets, their well-landscaped setting and variety of retail outlets make them favorites among both locals and tourists.

*'''May Park'''
Named to commemorate the [[May Revolution]] of 1810, the park a children's section, an artificial lake with an island, fish and aquatic birds, a [[velodrom]]e, and numerous sculptures and monuments to General [[José de San Martín]], Governor Federico Cantoni, and to sports.

==Transport==
 [[File:Avenida Circunvalación de San Juan, Argentina.jpg|thumb|The San Juan Ring Road]]
The city has modern transport infrastructure and is accessible via a [[ring road]], and the South Access Freeway, among others. The city's outward growth has made a second ring road necessary, and the project is under construction. The motorway will reduce commuting times from Greater San Juan to downtown, and will also facilitate large freight truck traffic (diverting it from the city proper). It also calls for a complementary project for another motorway called South Corridor, connecting downtown San Juan with [[Rawson Department, San Juan|Rawson]] and other southern suburbs.

The urban public [[transport]] passengers from the City of San Juan consists of [[bus]] lines marked with numbers and letters (19 or 26A), linking the city centre with the various neighbourhoods and the rest of the Great San Juan. The city also has taxi service and remises.

The rapid growth of the city has necessitated new means of transportation, and a feasibility study was recently commissioned on the development of a [[Tram|trolley]] service between downtown and Greater San Juan. {{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The proposed routes would unite Chimbas-San Juan (Center)-[[Villa Krause]] and Rivadavia-San Juan (Center)-[[Santa Lucía, Corrientes|Santa Lucia]], as well as one circulating downtown.

Long distance public transport is provided by the modern Bus Terminal, with more than 6,000 sq metres (64,000 Sq ft) of area in platforms. The terminal also includes administration offices, ticketing, information, a police precinct, a first-aid room, telephone booths, shops, a restaurant, and other facilities.

[[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento Airport]] is located 15 kilometers from the city in 9 de Julio Department, more precisely in the village of Las Chacritas. This airport serves routes from San Juan to Buenos Aires.
	
The city is situated on [[National Route 40 (Argentina)|National Route 40]], connecting it with [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] (168&nbsp;km) to the south and [[La Rioja, Argentina|La Rioja]] (449&nbsp;km) to the north; National Route 20 connects San Juan to [[San Luis, Argentina|San Luis]] (323&nbsp;km to the east). Distances to other important cities are as follows: [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] (585&nbsp;km), [[San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca|Catamarca]] (623&nbsp;km) and [[Buenos Aires]] (1110&nbsp;km).

==Main sights==
[[File:Plaza Aberastain, ciudad de San Juan, Argentina.jpg|thumb|Aberastain Plaza]][[Image:CIUDAD DE SAN JUAN, Arg..jpg|left|thumb|View of one of the pedestrian streets]]

The old [[cathedral]], an 18th-century [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] style building, was destroyed in the 1944 earthquake, {{citation needed|date=July 2013}} but has been replaced by a modern-[[Tuscan order|Tuscan]]-[[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] building with a [[campanile]]. San Juan is the seat of a [[Roman Catholic]] [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] [[Archbishop]] and a Catholic University. San Juan possesses the Juan Victoria Auditorium, one of the most modern and active concert halls in Argentina, as well as many leafy parks and squares, including Parque de Mayo with its vast artificial lake.

In October 2016, the Teatro del Bicentenario opened in downtown San Juan, which allows for 1129 spectators, the largest in the Province and has become one of its main tourist attractions.

Tourism to San Juan is centered around wine production and [[wine tasting|dégustation]] as well as the  rock formations in places like the [[Ischigualasto]] National Park (which includes the [[Valle de la Luna (Argentina)|Valle de la Luna]]), 330&nbsp;km north of the city, and the [[Quebrada de Ullum Dam]] (18&nbsp;km from the city).

An integral attraction to the province is its large [[Triassic]] period fossil record, believed to be one of the largest in the world. {{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

There is also the [[Mariano Gambier]] Archeology museum at La Laja, Albardón county, some 25&nbsp;km from the center of the city. It concerns itself with the many cultures that inhabited San Juan from [[Pre-History]] till the arrival of the Spaniards in 1560. It has a priceless collection of Indian artifacts, cave paintings and other elements of agriculture and life in the Tulum valley from the last 8500 years.
[[File:Casa Natal de Domingo Faustino Sarmiento en San Juan Argentina (EagLau--2008).jpg|thumb|The Sarmiento Birthplace Museum.]]
[[File:Acceso al Museo de Ciencias Naturales de San Juan, Argentina.jpg|thumb|Natural Sciences Museum.]]

The city also hosts the Fiesta Nacional del Sol, a festival that celebrates nature over five days in February.

Museums in the city include:

*Casa Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, located at the intersection of Libertador General San Martín Avenue and Sarmiento street. Made a [[List of National Historic Monuments of Argentina|National Historic Monument]] in 1910, this was the first site so designated in Argentina. The local educator and President of the Republic from 1868 to 1874, [[Domingo Sarmiento]], was born here in 1811 and raised here, as well.
*San Martin's Monastic Cell, in the Santo Domingo Convent, where Jose de San Martin, a military leader who led independence campaigns in Argentina, Chile and Peru, stayed during a 1815 visit to the city to raise support for the revolutionary wars. It maintains its simple furniture from the time of his visit.
*Franklin Rawson Museum of Fine Arts/Agustín Gnecco Historical Provincial Museum, named after the local painter [[Benjamin Franklin Rawson]] (1819–1871). It houses a  patrimony of paintings and sculptures, engravings and drawings from national artists. The Gnecco Museum features elements related to fashion in the 18th and 19th centuries, Creole silverwork, as well as historic numismatics and [[Postage stamps and postal history of Argentina|philately]] collections.  
*Amid Read Museum/Carlos Gardel House of Tango provides displays and videos outlining the development of [[Argentine Tango]], and its evolution in the 20th century. Conferences, discussions, and violin and [[bandoneón]] classes are among the activities hosted here.
*  Natural Sciences Museum. This facility, housed in a former [[Rail transport in Argentina|railway station]] is known for its [[dinosaur]] fossil collections, found mainly in the nearby [[Ischigualasto]] Valley.
