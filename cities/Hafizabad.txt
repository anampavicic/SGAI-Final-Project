In 327 BC, during Alexander's invasion of Punjab, the territory of the [[Sandal Bar]] was reported to be a well populated area. Large cities were located in this territory, and a lot of sub states were organized under the presidency of maharajas and rajas. It is located to the east of [[Chenab River]].

== History ==
In 327 BC, the area around Hafizabad was reportedly well-populated during [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s invasion of [[Punjab]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Hafizabad: History |url=http://punjab.gov.pk/hafizabad_history |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705115808/http://punjab.gov.pk/hafizabad_history |archive-date=5 July 2014 |access-date=5 March 2014 |publisher=Government of the Punjab}}</ref> During the [[Delhi Sultanate]] period, majority of the local population were converted to [[Islam]]. A large city was situated at the site of the present village of Mehdiabad, northwest of present day Hafizabad. Later it became unpopulated due to shortage of water and [[Pashtun people|Afghan]] incursions. The region remained uninhabited until the reign of [[Mughal emperors|Mughal emperor]] [[Akbar]], when it became the site of a [[Mahal (palace)|Mahal]] as documented in ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]''.<ref name="IGI">{{Cite web |title=Imperial Gazetteer2 of India, Volume 13, page 5 – Imperial Gazetteer of India – Digital South Asia Library |url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V13_011.gif |website=dsal.uchicago.edu}}</ref>

After the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, the minority [[Hindu|Hindus]] and [[Sikh|Sikhs]] migrated to [[India]] while [[Muslim]] refugees from [[India]] settled in Hafizabad. Most of the refugees have since settled and inter-married with the local population.{{fact|date=April 2023}}
