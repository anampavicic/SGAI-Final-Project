Agriculture also occupies a portion with high added value in Kemalpaşa's economy, its [[cherries]] being of nationwide renown (''known as Kemalpaşa kirazı in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]'') and exported. Literacy is at a high level at 90%, and the neighboring Bornova, where [[Ege University]] is based, serves as a nearby pool in terms of trained personnel.

== Administration ==
A township depending the [[sanjak]] (subprovince) of Saruhan (Manisa) until the late-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] times, the town was attached to the subprovince of İzmir in 1900 and a municipal administration was constituted the year after.

== History ==
[[Image:NejdetDuzen KarabelHittiteLuwianMonumentCarvedinRockKemalpasaTurkey.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Karabel relief]]]]
Kemalpaşa region has always been a key point of passage between the [[Gulf of İzmir]] and the lands of the [[Anatolia]]n interior. The recorded history dates back to 1300 BC. The [[Karabel relief]] depicting a [[Hittites|Hittite]] warrior was until recently the only trace of that civilization discovered in western Anatolia. The recent discovery and the explorations that are currently being conducted in the [[prehistory|prehistoric]] mound ([[höyük]]) near the depending municipality of [[Ulucak]] (''Ulucak Höyüğü''), is likely to shed new lights to the region's earlier history. There are also numerous [[tumuli]] in the [[Lydia]]n style in the region.

=== Karabel Hittite-Luwian rock relief ===
The relief is a late [[Hittites|Hittite]]-[[Luwians|Luwian]] [[rock relief]] about 1.5 meter wide and 2.5 meters high and located in a passage between two mountains on the road south to [[Torbalı]] at a distance of six kilometers from Kemalpaşa center.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.hittitemonuments.com/karabel/ | title = Karabel | publisher = www.hittitemonuments.com }}</ref> It is dated to the second half of the 13th century BCE during the reign of [[Tudhaliya IV]]. A male figure depicted standing with a bow in his right hand and a spear in his left wearing a tunic and a cone-shaped hat is identified as [[Tarkasnawa]], King of Mira, according to a recent reading by David Hawkins, widely approved by scholars and matched with a name mentioned in [[Hattusa]] Hittite annals.<ref>{{cite book |title= Tarkasnawa, King of Mira |author= David Hawkins |publisher= Anatolian Studies, Vol. 48 |year=1998}}</ref> The relief is called "Eti Baba" (''the Hittite father'') locally.<ref>{{cite book |title=Aegean Turkey: An archaeological guide |ISBN=978-0-510-03200-5 |date=1967 |author=George E.

=== {{anchor|Nymphaion}} Nymphaion – Nif – Kemalpaşa ===
{{rquote|right|''“Its fortress is a strongly built edifice on a steep rock and has five corners, the circumference measuring two thousand and two hundred steps and it has two gates, and ice-cold waters flow from the domes built under these. It is not possible to reach one's hands comfortably to take a third bowl of water.”''|[[Evliya Çelebi]], 17th century Turkish traveller on Nif <ref>{{cite book|title = Evliya Çelebi's Book of travels: Land and people of the Ottoman Empire in the seventeenth century: a corpus of partial editions |ISBN=90-04-11485-8|chapter= Manisa nach Evliya Çelebi, Aus dem neunten Band des Seyahatname, by Nuran Tezcan |page=83 |author1=Evliya Çelebi|author1-link=Evliya Çelebi|author2=Klaus Kreiser|author3=Martin van Bruinessen|author4=Hendrik E.

The town's name in classical and medieval times was Nymphaion ({{langx|el|Νύμφαιον}}). It rose to prominence during the late Byzantine times, when it became the favourite winter residence of the [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaean emperors]] during the 13th century. A palace, whose well-preserved remains are still extant, was built there by [[John III Doukas Vatatzes]]. The association with the Nicaean court made Nymphaion a center of imperial politics: the city was raised to an archbishopric, where John III spent his final months, and both [[Theodore II Laskaris]] and [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] were crowned. The two 13th-century important treaties in [[Treaty of Nymphaeum (1214)|1214]] and [[Treaty of Nymphaeum (1261)|1261]] both referred to as Treaty of Nymphaeum were concluded there with the [[Italy|Italian states]].<ref name="ODB">{{Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium | last = Foss | first = Clive | title = Nyphaion | pages=1505–1506 }}</ref> The latter was to have an important impact on the region's future, virtually ceding [[Smyrna]] to the [[Republic of Genoa]]. In the last decades of the 13th century, it became a major Byzantine stronghold against the advances of the [[Anatolian Turkish Beyliks|Turkish beyliks]]: both emperor [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]] and the celebrated general [[Alexios Philanthropenos]] used it as their headquarters in the 1290s. The town fell to the Turkish Bey of [[Sarukhanids|Saruhan]] in 1315.<ref name="ODB"/> From 1867 until 1922, Nif was part of [[Aidin Vilayet]].

Under Turkish rule, the town's original name was echoed in the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] name "Nif" which was in use until the early years of the [[Republic of Turkey]]. The name Nif was changed to Kemalpaşa in honor of [[Mustafa Kemal Paşa]] who had spent the night of 9 September 1922 here, before the closing chapter of the [[Occupation of Smyrna]] the next day, putting an end to the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]] in the field. The name "Nif" is no longer used for the city, even colloquially, although its status of former name is common knowledge. Nif was one of the centers that were densely populated by Anatolian [[Greeks]] till the first quarter of the 20th century, before the [[Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations]].

The mountain on the slopes of which the city of Kemalpaşa extends and the district's most important stream are still called Nif (respectively, ''Nif Dağı'' and ''Nif Çayı''). With its summit reaching 1.510 meters high, [[Mount Nif]] was one of the mountains called [[Olympus (disambiguation)|Olympus]] in ancient times and is renowned today for its dense forests of [[oak]]s, [[oleaster]]s, [[pine]]s and other trees of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] basin, cold springs and [[trout]] farms. The River Nif enters the district area near the township of Ulucak, crosses the plain to skip tangentially into the area of the neighboring district of Bornova, at which level a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] bridge is found, rejoins Kemalpaşa to flow into [[Gediz River]] further north near Manisa.

A large part of the land in Kemalpaşa district (1.310 hectares) is irrigated or has the infrastructure for regular irrigation, which explains the primary place occupied by [[maize]] among the [[Cereal|grains]] produced, making Kemalpaşa an exceptional case in western Anatolia. The Union of Cherry Producers has 177 members, mostly large-scale producers. 1.594.600 cherry trees in total produced 47.838 tonnes of fruit in 2006 for Kemalpaşa.

The portion occupied by vineyards and grains more than halved between 2000 and 2006, while the land used for the production of cherries doubled. Since cherries are relatively easier to maintain and process, and a large national and export market exists, their production increasingly attracts the attention of urban-based and hobby-minded producers who would assure the daily care outside the collect typically through the offices of one villager. There is also a growing tendency towards diversification in the vegetables produced, new breeds in demand by Izmir's customer base and previously unheard of like [[broccoli]]s, [[asparagus]], [[soybeans]], [[kiwifruit|kiwis]], [[Diospyros kaki|kakis]], also making their appearance. The level of [[mechanisation]] in agricultural activities is high and well above the national averages.

Kemalpaşa's proximity to İzmir and the tendency of the population to head for the big city for activities of social life becomes a factor which plays against Kemalpaşa district center in terms of the availability on the spot of social facilities. While the mountain passage at Karabel where the Hittite monument is located has been arranged into a [[picnic]] area and the remains of [[John III Doukas Vatatzes|Vatatzes]]'s palace could attract more visitors, the absence of facilities for overnight visitors tend to limit Kemalpaşa's tourism potential to daily visits or excursions by trekking or hunting groups.
