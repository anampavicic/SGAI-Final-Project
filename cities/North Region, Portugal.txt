The '''North Region''' ({{langx|pt|Região do Norte}} {{IPA|pt|ʁɨʒiˈɐ̃w du ˈnɔɾtɨ|}}) or '''Northern Portugal''' is the most populous region in [[Portugal]], ahead of [[Lisbon Region|Lisbon]], and the third most extensive by area. The region has 3,576,205 inhabitants according to the 2017 census, and its area is {{convert|21,278|km|mi}} with a density of 173 inhabitants per square kilometre. It is one of five [[Regions of Portugal|regions of Mainland Portugal]] ([[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS]] II subdivisions). Its main population center is the [[urban area]] of [[Porto]], with about one million inhabitants; it includes a larger political metropolitan region with 1.8 million, and an urban-metropolitan agglomeration with 2.99 million inhabitants, including [[Porto]] and neighboring cities, such as [[Braga]], [[Guimarães]] and [[Póvoa de Varzim]]. The Commission of Regional Coordination of the North (CCDR-N) is the agency that coordinates environmental policies, land-use planning, cities and the overall development of this region, supporting local governments and associations.<ref>{{cite web | title= CCDR-N Uma instituição SMART | url= http://www.ccdr-n.pt/sites/default/files/af_ccdrn_brochura_inst_pt.pdf | access-date=September 13, 2017 | publisher = CCDR-N | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423112655/http://www.ccdr-n.pt/sites/default/files/af_ccdrn_brochura_inst_pt.pdf | archive-date=April 23, 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

Northern Portugal is a culturally varied region. It is a land of dense vegetation and profound historic and cultural wealth.  What is now Northern Portugal was first settled by various pre-Celtic and [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes before being visited by a number of [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] civilizations who traded in its river-mouths, including [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]], conquest by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], invasion by [[Germanic peoples]], and attacks by the [[Moors]] and the [[Vikings]].

==History and culture==
The region has been inhabited since [[prehistoric]] times and is a key area for the understanding of both [[Atlantic Europe]]an, [[Megalith]]ic and [[Castro Culture|Castro]] cultures. Historically, Northern Portugal with [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] in Spain, made up the [[Kingdom of Galicia]]. In protohistoric times, it was inhabited by [[Gallaeci]] tribes, related with the Lusitanians, and it corresponds roughly to [[Conventus Bracarensis]] of Roman [[Gallaecia]]. The historical [[Suebic Kingdom of Galicia|Suebic Kingdom]] (5th-6th centuries AD) had its capital in the now Portuguese city of [[Braga]] and most of these migrants and invaders established themselves in Littoral Northern Portugal, when the Roman empire collapsed. After the Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, a small county was established around the city of Porto, which expanded southwards and became a government, the [[County of Portugal]] in the 10th century. This county grew in ambition and it was where Portugal's first king, [[Afonso I of Portugal|Dom Afonso Henriques]], established the Portuguese kingdom and stated the southward expansion. The [[Portuguese language]] evolved from this area, and has a specific modern dialect, [[Northern Portuguese]], taken down south as the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese Kingdom]] expanded, namely after Afonso Henriques era.

The region has a number of manor-houses and castles featuring [[coats of arms]] as an indication of a very intense medieval period. Regional cuisine is renowned and varied offering products such as light wines (''vinhos verdes'') and rich wines, and a variety of handicrafts that mingles the shine of filigree with the colour of the local embroideries. Northern Portugal is also very rich in folklore and traditions dating back to antiquity.

Galicia and Northern Portugal have been promoting the official candidacy for the recognition of the common [[intangible cultural heritage]] by [[UNESCO]]. The project is backed by the [[Xunta de Galicia|Galician Government]], a number of Galician institutions and associations, together with local and regional governments and institutions in Northern Portugal. The official name is "''[http://www.opatrimonio.org/en/principal.asp Candidatura de Património Imaterial Galego-Português]''".

==Geography==
[[file:Rio_Lima_1.jpg|thumb|left|Cávado river in [[Peneda-Gerês National Park]], an area with extreme rainfall.]]
[[file:Parque_Litoral.jpg|thumb|Northern Littoral Natural Park in Esposende.]]
[[file:Vista do Douro no Parque Natural do Douro Internacional.jpg|thumb|The inland Douro Valley area is exposed to hot summers and seasonal aridity.]]
Northern Portugal is a mountainous region. Its peaks known as ''serras'' include Serra do Gerês (1544 m), Peneda (1416 m), Marão (1415 m) and Soajo (1415 m). Some of which forms natural parks: the [[Peneda-Gerês National Park]], [[Montesinho Natural Park]], and the [[Alvão Natural Park]].

The coast, known as the ''[[Costa Verde (Portugal)|Costa Verde]]'', is a flat strip of land enclosed by sandy beaches and hills, the largest of which is the coastal plain between the Cávado and the Ave rivers. The area is known for the long stretch of picturesque sand dunes which accumulated during the [[Little Ice Age]], part of which is protected in the [[Northern Littoral Natural Park]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Correira Cardoso |first=A. A. |date=2005 |title=Padrões de ocupação do solo em áreas de risco natural: O caso do Litoral Poveiro | publisher = Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto}}</ref>

The [[Minho river|Minho]], [[Lima river|Lima]], [[Neiva river|Neiva]], [[Cávado river|Cávado]], [[Ave river|Ave]] and the [[Douro river|Douro]] are the most preeminent rivers that flow to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Inland, the [[Tâmega river|Tâmega]] is a major tributary which empties in the Douro river. The Douro is the most preeminent river, and one of the most important rivers in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The Minho river marks the northwestern Portuguese-Spanish border and is the second most important river.<ref>{{cite web | title= Major Rivers Of Portugal | date= 25 April 2017 | url= http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/major-rivers-of-portugal.html | access-date=September 13, 2017 | publisher = World Atlas }}</ref>

There are four [[World Heritage Sites]]: the [[Douro DOC|Alto Douro]] Wine Region, the Prehistoric [[Rock art|Rock-Art]] Sites in the [[Côa Valley]], the Porto historical Center and the Guimarães historical Center. Throughout the region the rivers, waterfalls, vineyards and fertile plots combine with the ancestral monuments in urban centres.

===Climate===

The region has a warm Mediterranean climate (''Csb'') on the coast and a hot Mediterranean climate (''Csa'') along the Douro Valley. Northwestern Portugal has temperate summers and mild winters, influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and the [[diurnal temperature variation]] rarely reaches {{convert|10|°C|°F|1}}, while inland northeastern Portugal has hot summers and cold longer winters, hence continental features, and the diurnal temperature variation can reach {{convert|20|°C|°F|1}}.

Rainfall is very irregular as topography and distance from the sea strongly influence precipitation levels, even at short distances.<ref>{{cite web | title= O clima da região do Porto | url= http://web.letras.up.pt/asaraujo/geofis/t1.html#porto | access-date=December 27, 2012 | publisher = Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto | last = Araújo  | first = Maria da Assunção }}</ref> The inland mountainous areas in the northwest around the peaks of Peneda, Gerês and Marão have the highest rainfall in all of Portugal.<ref>{{cite web | title= Formas de Relevo e Clima - Conclusões | url= http://web.letras.up.pt/cbateira/formas%20do%20relevo%20e%20clima.htm | access-date=September 13, 2017 | publisher = TERRISC - U.Porto }}</ref> The Douro valley, however, is among the driest areas in all of Portugal.<ref>{{cite web | title= O clima do PNPG e seu enquadramento no clima nacional | url= http://www.dct.uminho.pt/PNPG/pnpg_bio/clima.htm | access-date=September 13, 2017 | publisher = Departamento de Ciências da Terra - U.

==Demography==

[[file:Porto_Ribeira.jpg|thumb|left|Porto old town.]]
Politically, Northern Portugal is divided into 86 municipalities (''municípios''), which in turn are subdivided into 1,426 civil parishes (''freguesias''). The region was subdivided in supramunicipal districts in 1835. Northern Portugal includes the districts of Viana do Castelo, Braga, Porto, Vila Real, and Bragança, and partly the districts of Aveiro, Viseu, and Guarda. The largest municipalities are [[Vila Nova de Gaia]] (304,149), [[Porto]] (231,962), [[Braga]] (193,333), [[Matosinhos]] (172,669), [[Gondomar, Portugal|Gondomar]] (164,255), [[Guimarães]] (156,852), [[Santa Maria da Feira]] (136,720), [[Cidade da Maia|Maia]] (134,959), [[Vila Nova de Famalicão]] (133.590) and [[Barcelos, Portugal|Barcelos]] (116,777), according to the [[:pt:XVI_Recenseamento_Geral_da_População_de_Portugal|2021 Census]]. 

[[file:Braga_(642413343).jpg|thumb|Aerial of Braga showing the typical dispersed settlement of the region.]]
Ignoring municipal subdivisions, the region has one urban area, Greater Porto, with about one million inhabitants, this includes Porto, Vila Nova de Gaia, Matosinhos, Maia and some large suburbs such as Rio Tinto and Ermesinde. There is a significant urban network just above Greater Porto, with about 600,000 inhabitants: the Minho Urban Quadrilateral (''Quadrilátero Urbano do Minho''), which includes Braga, Guimarães, Vila Nova de Famalicão and Barcelos; and the urban area of Póvoa de Varzim-[[Vila do Conde]], with about 100,000 inhabitants. However, in Northern Portugal these tend to be well-populated with [[dispersed settlement]] between the diverse cities of the region. All these human settlements are part of the same polycentric urban-metropolitan agglomeration with 2,99 million inhabitants (2001), alongside the northern Atlantic coast.<ref name="tgv">Fernando Nunes da Silva (2005), [http://www.moptc.pt/tempfiles/20060227144758moptc.pdf Alta Velocidade em Portugal, Desenvolvimento Regional], CENSUR, IST  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624061135/http://www.moptc.pt/tempfiles/20060227144758moptc.pdf |date=24 June 2009 }}</ref>
