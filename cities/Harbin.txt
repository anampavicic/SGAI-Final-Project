==History==
===Early history===
Human settlement in the Harbin area dates from at least 2200 BC during the late [[Stone Age]]. [[Wanyan Aguda]], the founder and first emperor (reigned 1115–1123) of the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] (1115–1234), was born in the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Wanyan]] tribes who resided near the [[Ashi River]] in this region.<ref>{{cite book|author1= Su Jinyuan|title=On Wanyan Aguda's Political and Economic Reform|date= February 1982|publisher=[[Collected Papers of History Studies]]}}</ref>  In AD&nbsp;1115 Aguda established Jin's capital Shangjing (Upper Capital) [[Huining Prefecture]] in today's [[Acheng District]] of Harbin.<ref name="chinakindnesstour.com">{{cite web |url= http://www.chinakindnesstour.com/cityguide/Harbin/Attractions/cityguide_2532.shtml |title= The Remains of Huining in Shangjing of Jin Dynasty |publisher= China Kindness Tour |access-date= 2014-10-15 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150923202824/http://www.chinakindnesstour.com/cityguide/Harbin/Attractions/cityguide_2532.shtml |archive-date= 2015-09-23 }}</ref> After Aguda's death, the new emperor [[Emperor Taizong of Jin|Wanyang Sheng]] ordered the construction of a new city on a uniform plan.

After the [[Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty|Mongol conquest of the Jin Empire]] (1211–1234), Huining Prefecture was abandoned. In the 17th century, the Manchus used building materials from Huining Prefecture to construct their new stronghold in [[Acheng District|Alchuka]].

A small village in 1898 grew into the modern city of Harbin.<ref>{{cite book|title=Consul Hosie to Bax-Ironside|date=8 May 1899|series=Correspondence with the United States' Government Respecting Foreign Trade in China|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924023185204|page=[https://archive.org/details/cu31924023185204/page/n331 154]|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |script-title=zh:哈尔滨市志 |trans-title=History of Harbin |author=哈尔滨市地方志编纂委员会 |year=1998 |publisher=黑龙江人民出版社 (Heilongjiang People's Press) |isbn=978-7-207-03841-8|language=zh}}</ref> [[Poland|Polish]] engineer [[Adam Szydłowski]] drew plans for the city following the construction of the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]], which the [[Russian Empire]] had financed.<ref name="Polishstudy">{{cite web|title=Polish Studies in China|url=http://www.warsawvoice.pl/WVpage/pages/article.php/21997/article|website=The Warsaw Voice|access-date=15 October 2014|date=30 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006092304/http://www.warsawvoice.pl/WVpage/pages/article.php/21997/article|archive-date=6 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The Russians selected Harbin as the base of their administration over this railway and the [[Chinese Eastern Railway Zone]]. The railways were largely constructed by Russian engineers and indentured workers. The Chinese Eastern Railway extended the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], substantially reducing the distance from [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]] to [[Vladivostok]] and also linking the new port city of Dalny ([[Dalian]]) and the Russian naval base of Port Arthur ([[Lüshun]]). The settlement founded by the Russian-owned Chinese Eastern Railway quickly turned into a [[boomtown]], growing into a city within five years. The Russian-speaking settlers in Harbin came from all over the Russian Empire, including  Ukrainians, Poles, Jews, Georgians, and [[Tatar people|Tatars]], in addition to Russians, eventually  making Harbin a Russian town, with the majority of population coming from the south of the European Russia, i.e., actually from Ukraine.{{sfn|Karlinsky|2013|p=311}}

The city was intended as a showcase for Russian imperialism in Asia and the American scholar [[Simon Karlinsky]], who was born in Harbin in 1924 into a Russian-Jewish family, wrote that in Harbin "the buildings, boulevards, and parks were planned—well before the [[October Revolution]]—by distinguished Russian architects and also by Swiss and Italian town planners", giving the city a very European appearance.{{sfn|Karlinsky|2013|p=311}} Starting in the late 19th century, a mass influx of Han Chinese arrived in Manchuria, and taking advantage of the rich soils, founded farms that soon turned Manchuria into the "breadbasket of China" while others went to work in the mines and factories of Manchuria, which become one of the first regions of China to industrialize.  Harbin became one of the main points through which food and industrial products were shipped out of Manchuria.  A sign of Harbin's wealth was that a theater had established during its first decade and in 1907 the play ''[[K zvezdam]]'' by [[Leonid Andreyev]] had its premiere there.{{sfn|Karlinsky|2013|pp=312–313}}

During the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–05), Russia used Harbin as its base for military operations in Manchuria. Following Russia's defeat, its influence declined. Several thousand nationals from 33 countries, including the United States, Germany, and France, moved to Harbin. Sixteen countries established consulates to serve their nationals, who established several hundred industrial, commercial and banking companies. Churches were rebuilt for [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Harbin|Russian Orthodox]], [[Harbin Nangang Christian Church|Lutheran/German Protestant]], and [[Sacred Heart Cathedral of Harbin|Polish Catholic]] Christians. Chinese capitalists also established businesses, especially in brewing, food, and textiles.

The rapid growth of the city challenged the public healthcare system.

Dr. Wu asked for imperial sanction to cremate plague victims, as cremation of these infected victims turned out to be the turning point of the epidemic. The suppression of this plague pandemic changed medical progress in China.

The first generation of Harbin Russians were mostly the builders and employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway. They moved to Harbin in order to work on the railroad. At the time Harbin was not an established city. The city was almost built from scratch by the builders and early settlers. Houses were constructed, furniture and personal items were brought in from Russia. After the [[Manchurian plague]] epidemic, Harbin's population continued to increase sharply, especially inside the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone. In 1913 the Chinese Eastern Railway census showed its ethnic composition as: [[Russians]]&nbsp;– 34,313, Chinese (that is, including [[Han Chinese|Hans]], [[Manchus]] etc.)&nbsp;– 23,537, Jews&nbsp;– 5,032, [[Polish people|Poles]]&nbsp;– 2556, Japanese&nbsp;– 696, [[Germans]]&nbsp;– 564, [[Tatars]]&nbsp;– 234, [[Latvians]]&nbsp;– 218, [[Georgians]]&nbsp;– 183, [[Estonians]]&nbsp;– 172, [[Lithuanians]]&nbsp;– 142, [[Armenians]]&nbsp;– 124; there were also [[Crimean Karaites|Karaims]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Bashkirs]], and some Western Europeans.

Franck]] in his 1923 book ''Wanderings in North China'' writing the Russian "ladies as well gowned as at the Paris races [who] strolled with men faultlessly garbed by European standards", leading him to wonder how they had achieved this "deceptive appearance".{{sfn|Karlinsky|2013|p=312}}

The [[Harbin Institute of Technology]] was established in 1920 as the Harbin Sino-Russian School for Industry to educate railway engineers via a Russian method of instruction. Students could select from two majors at the time: Railway Construction or Electric Mechanic Engineering. On 2 April 1922, the school was renamed the Sino-Russian Industrial University. The original two majors eventually developed into two major departments: the Railway Construction Department and the Electric Engineering Department.  Between 1925 and 1928 the university's Rector was [[Leonid Ustrugov]], the Russian Deputy Minister of Railways under [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] before the [[Russian Revolution]], Minister of Railways under [[Admiral Kolchak]]'s government and a key figure in the development of the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]].

The Russian community in Harbin made it their mission to preserve the pre-revolutionary culture of Russia. The city had numerous Russian language newspapers, journals, libraries, theaters, and two opera companies.{{sfn|Karlinsky|2013|p=313–314}} One of the famous Russian poets in Harbin was [[Valery Pereleshin]], who started publishing his intensely [[Homosexuality|homoerotic]] poetry in 1937 and was also one of the few Russian writers in Harbin who learned Mandarin.{{sfn|Karlinsky|2013|p=315–316}} The subject of Pereleshin's poetry caused problems with the [[Russian Fascist Party]], and led Pereleshin to leave Harbin for Shanghai, and ultimately to the United States.{{sfn|Karlinsky|2013|p=315–316}} Not all of the Russian newspapers were of high quality, with Karlinsky calling ''[[Nash Put' (newspaper)|Nash put'<nowiki/>]]'', the newspaper of the [[Russian Fascist Party]] "the lowest example of gutter journalism that Harbin had ever seen".{{sfn|Karlinsky|2013|p=315}} [[Nikolai Baikov]], a Russian writer in Harbin was known for his novels of exile life in that city together with his accounts of his travels across Manchuria and the folklore of its Manchu and Chinese population.{{sfn|Karlinsky|2013|p=315}} [[Boris Yulsky]], a young Russian writer who published his short stories in the newspaper ''[[Rubezh (newspaper)|Rubezh]]'' was considered to be a promising writer whose career was cut short when he gave up literature for activism in the Russian Fascist Party and cocaine addiction.{{sfn|Karlinsky|2013|p=315}} [[Kyakhta Russian–Chinese Pidgin|Moya-tvoya]] (mine – yours), a [[pidgin]] language that was a combination of Russian and [[Mandarin Chinese]] that had developed in the 19th century when Chinese went to work in Siberia, was considered essential by the Chinese businesspeople of Harbin.{{sfn|Karlinsky|2013|p=313}}

Japan invaded [[Manchuria]] outright after the [[Mukden Incident]] in September 1931. After the Japanese captured [[Qiqihar]] in the [[Jiangqiao Campaign]], the [[4th Mixed Brigade (Imperial Japanese Army)|Japanese 4th Mixed Brigade]] moved toward Harbin, closing in from the west and south. Bombing and strafing by Japanese aircraft forced the Chinese army to retreat from Harbin.

One of the main reasons of this setback is with its Soviet ties deteriorating and the [[Vietnam War]] escalating, China became concerned of a possible nuclear attack. [[Mao Zedong]] ordered an evacuation of military and other key state enterprises away from the northeastern frontier, with Harbin being the core zone of this region, bordering the [[Soviet Union]]. During this [[Third Front (China)|Third Front Development]] Era of China, several major factories of Harbin were relocated to Southwestern Provinces including [[Gansu]], [[Sichuan]], [[Hunan]] and [[Guizhou]], where they would be strategically secure in the event of a possible war. Some major universities of China were also moved out of Harbin, including Harbin Military Academy of Engineering (predecessor of Changsha's [[National University of Defense Technology]]) and Harbin Institute of Technology (Moved to [[Chongqing]] in 1969 and relocated to Harbin in 1973).<ref>{{cite web|title=Japan-China Relations in the 21st Century|url=http://www.keidanren.or.jp/english/policy/2001/006.html|website=Kendairen.or.jp|publisher=Japan Federation of Economic Organizations|access-date=15 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323225647/http://www.keidanren.or.jp/english/policy/2001/006.html|archive-date=23 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

National economy and social service have obtained significant achievements since the [[Chinese economic reform]] first introduced in 1979. Harbin holds the China Harbin International Economic and Trade Fair each year since 1990.<ref name="Historical Evolution"/> Harbin once housed one of the largest Jewish communities in the Far East before World War II. It reached its peak in the mid-1920s when 25,000 [[European Jews]] lived in the city. Among them were the parents of [[Ehud Olmert]], the former [[Prime Minister of Israel]]. In 2004, Olmert came to Harbin with an Israeli trade delegation to visit the grave of his grandfather in Huang Shan Jewish Cemetery,<ref name="Olmert">

===Climate===
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Harbin features a [[monsoon]]-influenced [[humid continental climate]] (''[[Humid continental climate#Hot summer subtype|Dwa]]''). Due to the [[Siberian high]] and its location above 45 degrees north latitude, the city is known for its cold weather and long winter.<ref name="Profiles of China Provinces, Cities and Industrial Parks"/> Its nickname ''Ice City'' is well-earned, as winters in the city are dry and freezing cold, with a 24-hour average in January of only {{convert|−17.3|°C|1}}, although the city sees little precipitation during the winter and is often sunny. Spring and autumn constitute brief transition periods with variable wind directions. Summers can be hot, with a July mean temperature of {{convert|23.7|°C|1}}. Summer is also when most of the year's rainfall occurs, and more than half of the annual precipitation, at {{convert|539|mm}}, occurs in July and August alone. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 45 percent in December to 60 percent in September, the city receives 2,340 hours of bright sunshine annually; on average precipitation falls 99 days out of the year. The annual mean temperature is {{convert|5.2|°C|1}}, and extreme temperatures have ranged from {{convert|−42.6|°C|0}} or for the official weather station there, {{convert|-41.1|°C|0}} in January 1931<ref>{{Cite web |title=Extreme Temperatures Around the World |url=https://www.mherrera.org/temp.htm |access-date=2024-09-29 |website=www.mherrera.org}}</ref> to {{convert|39.2|°C|0}} on which was hit most recently on 4 June 2001,<ref>{{Cite web |title=东北晴热 哈尔滨35.3℃现今年首个高温-资讯-中国天气网 |url=https://news.weather.com.cn/565590.shtml |access-date=2024-09-29 |website=news.weather.com.cn}}</ref> though an unofficial record high temperature of {{convert|41.0|°C|1}} was recorded in July 1907.<ref name="Climatological Summary">{{cite web |url=http://www.harbin.gov.cn/english/Harbin_Overview/Climatological_Summary.htm |title=Climatological Summary |publisher=Harbin Municipal Government |access-date=2011-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130223054/http://www.harbin.gov.cn/english/Harbin_Overview/Climatological_Summary.htm |archive-date=2013-01-30 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=哈尔滨市道里区人民政府地理地貌气候 |url=http://www.hrbdl.gov.cn/hebdlq/col1/202302/c01_862602.shtml |access-date=2024-09-18 |website=www.hrbdl.gov.cn}}</ref>

===Cuisine===

Harbin is renowned for its culinary tradition. The cuisine of Harbin consists of European dishes and Northern Chinese dishes mainly typified by heavy sauce and deep-frying.<ref name="cnntravel">

One of the most famous dishes in [[Northeastern Chinese cuisine]] is [[Guo Bao Rou]], a form of sweet and sour pork. It is a classic dish from Harbin that originated in the early 20th century in Daotai Fu ({{zh|道台府|hp=Dàotái Fǔ|links=no}}).<ref name="Guobaorou">{{cite web|script-title=zh:"锅包肉"来自道台府|url=http://www.hljnews.cn/fou_baoye/2005-10/25/content_884048.htm|script-work=zh:生活报|via=Heilongjiang News |access-date=1 March 2014|date=25 October 2005|language=zh|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306231357/http://www.hljnews.cn/fou_baoye/2005-10/25/content_884048.htm|archive-date=6 March 2014}}</ref> It consists of a bite-sized pieces of pork in a [[potato starch]] [[batter (cooking)|batter]], deep-fried until crispy. They are then lightly coated in a variation of a sweet and sour sauce, made from freshly prepared [[syrup]], rice vinegar, sugar, flavoured with ginger, cilantro, sliced carrot and garlic. The Harbin Guobaorou is distinct from that of other areas of China, such as Liaoning, where the sauce may be made using either tomato ketchup or orange juice. Rather the Harbin style is dominated by the honey and ginger flavours and has a clear or honey yellow colour. Originally the taste was fresh and salty. In order to fete foreign guests, Zheng Xingwen, the chef of Daotai Fu, altered the dish into a sweet and sour taste. Usually, people prefer to go to several small or middle size restaurants to enjoy this dish, because it is difficult to handle the frying process at home.<ref name="Guobaorou"/>

Demoli Stewed Live Fish is one among other notable dishes in Harbin, which is originated in a village named Demoli on the expressway from Harbin to Jiamusi. The village is now Demoli Service Area on Harbin-Tongjiang Expressway.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://heilongjiang.dbw.cn/system/2010/09/02/052704618.shtml |script-title=zh:哈同公路得莫利服务区打造"龙江第一服务区" |website=dbw.cn Heilongjiang |date=2010-09-02 |language=zh-cn |access-date=3 March 2014 |archive-date=6 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006135225/http://heilongjiang.dbw.cn/system/2010/09/02/052704618.shtml }}</ref> Stewed Chicken with Mushrooms, Braised Pork with Vermicelli, and quick-boil pork with Chinese sauerkraut are also typical authentic local dishes.

While there are ice sculptures throughout the city, there are two main exhibition areas: enormous snow sculptures at Sun Island (Taiyang Dao, a [[Tourist Attraction Rating Categories of China|AAAAA-rated]] recreational area on the opposite side of the Songhua River from the city) and the separate "Ice and Snow World" that operates each night with lights switched on, illuminating the sculptures from both inside and outside. Ice and Snow World features illuminated full-size buildings made from blocks of 2–3 feet thick crystal clear ice directly taken from the Songhua River, which passes through the city. The sculptures inside the exhibition ground takes 15,000 workers to work for 16 days. In early December, ice artisans cut 120,000 cubic metres (4.2&nbsp;million cubic feet) of ice blocks from Songhua river's frozen surface as raw materials for the ice sculptures' show.<ref name="Iceismoney"/> Massive ice buildings, large-scale snow sculptures, ice slides, festival food and drinks can also be found in several parks and major avenues in the city.
