'''San Luis Potosí''' ({{IPA|es|san ˈlwis potoˈsi|-|SanLuisPotosí.ogg}}), officially the '''Free and Sovereign State of San Luis Potosí''' ({{langx|es|Estado Libre y Soberano de San Luis Potosí}}), is one of the 32 states which compose the [[Political divisions of Mexico|Federal Entities]] of [[Mexico]]. It is divided in [[Municipalities of San Luis Potosí|58 municipalities]] and its capital city is [[San Luis Potosí (city)|San Luis Potosí City]].

It is located in eastern and central Mexico<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.inegi.org.mx/temas/fisiografia/#|title=Mapas. Fisiográficos|access-date=2021-01-31|archive-date=2021-01-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210107010439/https://www.inegi.org.mx/temas/fisiografia/|url-status=live}}</ref> and is bordered by seven other Mexican states: [[Nuevo León]] to the north; [[Tamaulipas]] to the north-east; [[Veracruz]] to the east; [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], [[Querétaro]] and [[Guanajuato]] to the south; and [[Zacatecas]] to the north-west. In addition to the capital city, other major cities in the state include [[Ciudad Valles]], [[Matehuala]], [[Rioverde, San Luis Potosí|Rioverde]], and [[Tamazunchale]].

==History==
In [[pre-Columbian]] times, the territory now occupied by the state of San Luis Potosí contained parts of the cultural areas of [[Mesoamerica]] and [[Aridoamerica]]. Its northern and western-central areas were inhabited by the [[Otomi people|Otomi]] and [[Chichimeca]] tribes. These indigenous groups were nomadic hunter-gatherers. Although many indigenous people died during Spanish colonization, [[La Huasteca|Huasteco]] groups still live, along with [[Pame people|Pame]] and [[Nahuatl|Náhua]] peoples.
[[File:Nebel Voyage 37 San Luis Potosí.jpg|thumb|View of San Luis Potosí by [[Carl Nebel]]]]
In 1592, gold and silver deposits were discovered, which triggered the establishment of the state.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} Spanish miners established the first town known as “San Luis de Mezquitique”, modern location of the capital [[San Luis Potosí (city)|San Luis Potosí]]. This led to [[Juan de Oñate]] being appointed as the first mayor.

The State was given the name "San Luis Rey", ''King Saint Louis'', in honor of [[Louis IX of France]], and "Potosí" because the wealth of the state compared to the rich silver mines in [[Potosí]], [[Bolivia]]. Settlers had hopes of rivaling the wealth of the Bolivian mine, but this was never truly accomplished. In the 17th and 18th centuries, [[Franciscan]]s, [[Order of Saint Augustine|Augustinians]], and [[Society of Jesuits|Jesuits]] arrived in the area and settled, then began to build churches and other buildings, many of which are still standing and have been turned into museums and universities.

In mid-1821, after the [[Mexican War of Independence|Independence of Mexico]], General Jose Antonio Echavarri intimidated and threatened the Mayor and the City Council to surrender the city of San Luis to the [[Army of the Three Guarantees]] of [[Agustín de Iturbide]] (Ejercito de las Tres Garantias de Iturbide), who at the time was emperor of Mexico. They submitted to his demand, as there was no way to resist, and thus proclamation of Independence of San Luis Potosí was declared. The first Constitution of San Luis Potosí was then written on October 16, 1826, and was in effect until 1835 when Congress proclaimed it centralist.  At this point, local legislatures disappeared and state governors were appointed by the central government. This situation lasted until the promulgation of the [[Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States of 1857|1857 Constitution]].{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

The state's participation in the [[Mexican–American War]] in 1846–1847 gave it the name "San Luis de la Patria",<ref name="Saka2013">{{cite book|author=Mark Saad Saka|title=For God and Revolution: Priest, Peasant, and Agrarian Socialism in the Mexican Huasteca|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sS4wPTfGsGMC&pg=PA21|date=1 September 2013|publisher=UNM Press|isbn=978-0-8263-5339-9|page=21|access-date=25 November 2019|archive-date=17 June 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220617182910/https://books.google.com/books?id=sS4wPTfGsGMC&pg=PA21|url-status=live}}</ref> which translates into English, ''Saint Louis of the Homeland'', for having contributed important leaders and ideas during the struggle with the United States. During the [[Reform War]], state involvement was very prominent, and during the French Intervention in 1863, the city of San Luis Potosí became the capital of the country under the order of President [[Benito Juárez]].

During the regime of Maximilian, San Luis became an important location. The city was held by the Imperialists until late 1866. In that year, the telegraph line was opened between San Luis Potosí and Mexico City, which opened up communication lines and helped begin the industrialization of the state.

==Geography==
The state lies mostly on the [[Mexican Plateau]], with the exception of the eastern part of the state, where the tableland breaks down into the tropical valley of the Tampaon River (which continues flowing northwestward until it becomes the [[Pánuco River]], which divides San Luis Potosí from the north-eastern state of [[Tamaulipas]]). The surface of the plateau is comparatively level, with some low mountainous wooded ridges. The [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] runs north and south through the state, and separates the Mexican Plateau from the Gulf Coastal Plain to the east. The Sierra Madre Oriental is home to the [[Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak forests]]. The easternmost portion of the state lies on the Gulf Coastal Plain, and covered by the [[Veracruz moist forests]]. The eastern part is included in the region commonly referred to as "La Huasteca".

The Tampaón river and its tributaries drain the southern and southeastern portion of the state. The northern and central portion of the state, including the capital, lie on an [[interior drainage basin]] which does not drain to the sea.

The mean elevation is about {{Convert|6,000|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}, ensuring a mostly temperate climate. The state lies partly within the arid zone of the north, while the southern half receiving more rainfall through the influence of the [[Norte (wind)|Norte]]s, which deliver significant amounts of rain. The rainfall, however, is uncertain at the western and northern regions, and much of the state does not have major rivers. The soil is fertile and in favorable seasons large crops of wheat, maize, beans and cotton are grown on the uplands. In the low tropical valleys, sugar, coffee, tobacco, peppers and fruit are staple products. Livestock is an important industry and hides, tallow and wool are exported. Fine cabinet and construction woods are also made and exported to a limited extent.

[[Potosí]] (in Bolivia) was believed to have enough gold to build a bridge between Potosí and Spain. San Luis Potosí was compared to it upon the discovery of the mines and therefore named after it.

At one time San Luis Potosí ranked among the leading [[mining]] provinces of Mexico, but the revolts following independence resulted in a great decline in that industry. The area around [[Real de Catorce]] has some of the richest [[silver]] mines in the country. Other well-known silver mining districts are [[Peñón Blanco, Durango|Peñón Blanco]], [[Ramos, San Luis Potosí|Ramos]] and [[Guadalcázar, San Luis Potosí|Guadalcázar]]. The development of Guadalcazar dates from 1620 and its ores yield [[gold]], [[copper]], [[zinc]] and [[bismuth]], as well as silver. In the Ramos district, the Cocinera lode was said to have had a total yield of over $60,000,000 in the first decade of the 20th century.

====Mining====
In 1996, [[Minera San Xavier]] (MSX), a subsidiary of Canadian company [[New Gold Inc.|New Gold]], announced plans to start open pit mining at [[Cerro de San Pedro|Cerro San Pedro]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Stoltenborg|first1=Didi|last2=Boelens|first2=Rutgerd|date=2016-04-15|title=Disputes over land and water rights in gold mining: the case of Cerro de San Pedro, Mexico|journal=Water International|volume=41|issue=3|pages=447–467|doi=10.1080/02508060.2016.1143202|issn=0250-8060|doi-access=free}}</ref> There was major opposition to the project, but in 2007, the mine started operating, and was still both active and disputed as of 2016.<ref name=":0" />

One of the mountains within the state's declared National Sacred Site, [[Wirikuta]], is being purchased for [[silver mining]] by a Canadian company, [[First Majestic Silver]].<ref name="salvemoswirikuta.blogspot.com">Salvemos Wirikuta -Tamatzimahuaha: Frente en Defensa de la Zona Wirikuta. http://salvemoswirikuta.blogspot.com/2010/08/huichol-route-through-sacred-sites-to.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708062232/http://salvemoswirikuta.blogspot.com/2010/08/huichol-route-through-sacred-sites-to.html |date=2011-07-08 }}</ref>  The mountain is an important site for the [[Huichol people|Huichol]] ceremonial migration, [[Peyote]] hunt, and deer dance. On October 27, 2000, the [[United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) claimed this site as a protected area for its importance as a cultural route and endemic flora and fauna species.  Later on June 9, 2001, it was declared as a National Sacred Site under the State of San Luis Potosí's Natural Protection Act. First Majestic Silver Corp. still decided to purchase mineral rights on November 13, 2009, with 80% of their interest within the protected land. The company's current methods includes [[open pit mining]] and [[Leaching (chemistry)|leaching]] through [[cyanide]], using two kilograms of NaCN per tonne of ore. While open pit mining itself removes entire habitats and landscapes, the addition of sodium cyanide (with a mean lethal dose of only 0.2 grams) is potentially lethal.<ref name="salvemoswirikuta.blogspot.com" /> In April 2010 the company also opened a new cyanidation plant in [[Coahuila|Coahuila]], Mexico, where it has started producing 3,500 tons of cyanide a day to help them expand their mining efforts.<ref>Liezel Hill

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of the state shows Louis IX of France, after whom the state was named, standing on a hill in the town of [[Cerro de San Pedro]], where gold and silver were discovered. The state was well known for its gold and silver mines, so there are two gold bars on the left and two silver bars on the right. The blue and yellow backgrounds represent night and day, respectively.

==Governors==
{{main|Governor of San Luis Potosí}}
The current governor, {{As of|2021|lc=y|post=,}} is [[Ricardo Gallardo Cardona]] of the [[Ecologist Green Party of Mexico]].

The State has a unique position within the country, since it is located in between three major cities; [[Mexico City]], [[Monterrey]], and [[Guadalajara]], and near four major ports; [[Tampico]], [[Altamira, Tamaulipas|Altamira]], [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]], and [[Mazatlán]]. Its varied climate patterns and territory along with extensive communications networks enabled it to maintain attractive business environments.

Traditionally, the [[Real de Minas]] potosino has driven the industrial engines in the state of San Luis Potosí, and as such, nowadays basic [[metallurgy]] still has the largest contribution within the gross domestic product of the entity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} The main metals and products extracted across mines are zinc, copper, lead, gold, silver, mercury, manganese, and arsenic. Other major industries following the mining lead are in the sectors of chemicals, foods, beverages, tobacco, and textiles.

The services sector, also known as tertiary, is second regarding contribution to the state's income with a 21%, followed by commerce, hotels and restaurants with 18%.
These combined activities employ 51% of the economically active population or EAP.

Agriculture has been a traditional activity, sometimes still practiced in the [[Huasteca]] region. Currently, even if it contributes very little to the state GDP, it nevertheless employs as much as 20% of the EAP of the entity. The main agricultural products grown on Potosí soil are [[maize]], [[beans]], [[barley]], [[sugar cane]], [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[coffee]], sour [[lemon]], [[Opuntia|prickly pear]], and [[mango]]. Livestock activities are focused on raising sheep, cattle, and pigs.

The state is also a contributor to the large automotive industry of Mexico. [[General Motors]] now has a plant under construction, [[San Luis Potosí Assembly]], to employ up to 1,800 people which will have the capacity to produce up to 160,000 vehicles per year, or about 440 cars per day.<ref name="autonews.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thegmsource.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=1287|title=GM to produce Aveo at new Mexican plant, Stephen Downer, Automotive News|access-date=2008-04-09|archive-date=2012-02-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209184136/http://www.thegmsource.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=1287|url-status=live}}</ref>

Concerning immigrants and people of European ancestry, 63% of the population has some form of European roots, mostly from Spain. During the colonization and establishment of Mexico, there was a constant flow of [[Spaniards in Mexico|Spanish]] immigrants.

Besides Spanish people, there is also a significant population of descendants of Italian immigrants, especially in cities such as Rio Verde and Cerritos. Most of the European peoples have arrived through the state of Veracruz to the East.
