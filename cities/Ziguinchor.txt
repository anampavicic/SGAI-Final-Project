'''Ziguinchor''' ({{IPA|fr|zi.gɛ̃.ʃoʁ|lang}}; {{langx|wo|Siggcoor}} {{IPA|wo|sigːcɔːr|}}; {{langx|ar|زيغينكور}}) is the capital of the [[Ziguinchor Region]], and the chief town of the [[Casamance]] area of [[Senegal]], lying at the mouth of the [[Casamance River]]. It has a population of 214,874 (2023 census).<ref name="pop"/> It is the eighth largest city of Senegal, but is nearly separated from the north of the country by the nation of [[The Gambia]].

Unlike the [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] to [[arid climate|arid]] north of Senegal, Ziguinchor has a [[tropical savanna climate]], as it is under the influence of the [[West African Monsoon]]. It has an average annual accumulated rainfall of approximately {{convert|1547|mm|in|0|disp=or}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/wetlands/pdf/Africa/Region3/SENEGAL.pdf |title=SENEGAL |publisher=International Water Management Institute |access-date=4 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717033456/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/wetlands/pdf/Africa/Region3/SENEGAL.pdf |archive-date=17 July 2010 }}</ref>

==Etymology==
There are several competing etymologies for Ziguinchor's name. The best known comes from the time when Portuguese traders and explorers came to the region to form a trading post. It is derived from a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] phrase, ''Cheguei e choram'', "I came and they cry".  The local people, seeing the Europeans, began crying, thinking they were about to be enslaved. Other scholars believe that the name likely predates the Portuguese arrival. 

The earliest sources mention the [[Bainuk]] of ''Ezigichor''. The term may come from the [[Banyum language|Bainuk language]] words ''"asi nin core,"'' meaning "places to go are finished," relating to the end of the Bainuk migrations in their traditional history. It could also come from ''"ji gi cor,"' meaning "place of several fields."<ref>Bühnen, Stephan. “Place Names as an Historical Source: An Introduction with Examples from Southern Senegambia and Germany.” ''History in Africa,'' vol. 19, 1992, pp. 45–101.

==History==
[[File:ASC Leiden - Coutinho Collection - 7 02 - Official opening of a PAIGC secondary school in Ziguinchor, Senegal - 1974.tif|thumb|[[PAIGC]] Secondary School official opening in Ziguinchor, Senegal – 1974]]
[[File:ASC Leiden - Coutinho Collection - 11 06 - Ziguinchor hospital, Senegal - 1973.tif|thumb|[[PAIGC]] Ziguinchor hospital, 1973]]

The oldest habitation of the area was a [[Jola people|Jola]] village.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}} The first European settlement in the area was founded by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in 1645 as a dependency of [[Cacheu]] populated by settlers from [[Cape Verde]], and ''[[lancados]]'' and other Afro-Europeans.<ref name = Dictionary>{{cite book |first1=Richard Andrew Jr. |last1=Lobban |first2=Peter Karibe |last2=Mendy |title=Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau |edition=4th |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2013 |place=Lanham |isbn=978-0-8108-5310-2|pages=433–435}}</ref> 

The Portuguese objective was to found a trading post and establish an alliance with the local ''mansa'' or king of the [[Kasa kingdom]]. Chroniclers described him as the ruler most friendly to the Portuguese along the [[Guinea|Guinean]] coast. The king started to live in a European manner, with table, chairs and western clothing. His court included several Portuguese merchants.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}} One of the commodities for trade were enslaved Africans, and Ziguinchor became a [[Atlantic slave trade|slave port]] during much of the Portuguese rule.

The post boasted a fort with a few pieces of artillery by 1700, but was never an important economic center. The French occupied [[Carabane]] island downstream in 1836, forcing Portuguese ships to pay duties there. Despite frantic diplomatic efforts by governor [[Honório Barreto]], Portugal never really tried to defend their claim to the region. Ziguinchor was eventually transferred to  [[France]] on 22 April 1888, fulfilling a deal brokered at the [[Berlin conference]] of 1886.<ref name = Dictionary/>

Under the French, Ziguinchor became a major trade port, mostly due to the intensive [[peanut|groundnut]] cultivation which the colonial government encouraged in the interior. By 1900, the area was largely converted to Christianity, although significant [[Syncretist]] and [[Muslim]] communities flourish.

Rice growing, the traditional crop of the region, was hurt by the government's push to cultivate groundnuts. They forced the clearing of extensive forest areas.  The French government also imported rice from the [[intensive farming]] they encouraged in [[French Indochina]], shrinking the market for Casamance's traditional main produce.

After independence, the city's economic growth slowed, in part due to the [[Guinea-Bissau War of Independence|War of Independence]] in neighboring [[Guinea-Bissau]]. The Portuguese military crossed into the area at least once, pursuing [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde|PAIGC]] rebels. Cannon fire could be heard in the city for much of the war. During this period Ziguinchor became a main post for both the [[Senegalese Army]] and French forces, guarding the frontier that cut [[Jola people|Jola]] families and communities in two.

As the capital of Casamance, Ziguinchor has been at the center of a [[Casamance Conflict|three-decade-long conflict]] with Dakar that has flared into open civil war on more than one occasion. With a population with a majority of [[Diola]] and [[Christians|Christian]],<ref>Caroline JUILLARD.

A 1983 demonstration against price rises in Ziguinchor Market was put down violently by Senegalese forces, and an insurgency by the [[Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance]] (MFDC) followed, effectively wrecking the economy of the region.  The 2004 peace accords, signed in Ziguinchor, were hoped to be the end of the violence, but in 2006, sporadic fighting by an MFDC split and laying of land mines again erupted in rural areas nearby.<ref>[https://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/vol19no1/191senegal.htm Ernest Harsch.

[[Ousmane Sonko]], a prominent opposition leader, was elected [[mayor]] of Ziguinchor in 2022.

==Economy==
[[File:Port de Ziguinchor .jpg|thumb|right|Port of Ziguinchor]]
Ziguinchor remains economically dependent on its role as a [[cargo]] port, transport hub and [[ferry]] terminal.  The "Nationale 4" highway crosses the [[Casamance River]] just east of the city, linking the region with [[Bignona]] about 25&nbsp;km to the north, and (via [[The Gambia]]), the rest of Senegal.

A vibrant [[Tourism in Senegal|tourist]] destination, the beaches of nearby [[Cap Skirring]] were discovered by foreign tourists in the 1960s, and the location was built up to become one of the first [[Club Med]] resorts. Ziguinchor region is also known for growing great quantities of rice, oranges, [[mango]]es, bananas, [[cashews]], tropical fruits and vegetables, fish, and prawns, much of which are processed locally and exported from the city, its port, and its airport. It is also home to a large [[peanut]] [[Vegetable oil|oil]] [[factory]].

==Transport==
[[File:Ziguinchor9.JPG|thumb|right|The ferry terminal]]
[[File:ZiguinchorCasamance.JPG|thumb|right|View on Casamance River]]
The [[MV Joola]], which sank in 2002, was sailing from Ziguinchor to [[Dakar]]. The loss of the ferry, which was not replaced until 2005, cut the main link between Casamance and the rest of the country.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2286486.stm Eyewitness: Senegal weeps for ferry loss], BBC, 28 September 2002.<br />[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4431820.stm Senegal restores vital ferry link], BBC, 12 November 2005.</ref> The new ferry, which began regular runs in 2007, is named for local anti-colonial martyr [[Aline Sitoe Diatta]], and promises a boost to the local economy.

The city has an airport, [[Ziguinchor Airport]].

== Architecture ==
A number of buildings in the town have classified by government decree as historic, the cemetery and several government buildings, like the Ziguinchor Regional Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jo.gouv.sn/spip.php?article4607|title=ARRETE MINISTERIEL n° 2711 mcphc-dpc en date du 3 mai 2006|publisher=Republic of Senegal|access-date=17 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030850/http://www.jo.gouv.sn/spip.php?article4607|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Places of worship ==
[[File:ZiguinchorCathédrale.JPG|thumb|Saint-Anthoine de Padoue Cathedral]]
Among the [[places of worship]], they are predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and temples: [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ziguinchor]] ([[Catholic Church]]), [[Assemblies of God]], [[Universal Church of the Kingdom of God]].<ref>J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann, ''Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2010, p. 2573-2575</ref> There are also [[Islam|Muslim]] mosques.

==Demography==
Ziguinchor is a melting pot of all the ethnic groups co-existing in Senegal: [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]], [[Jola people|Jola]], [[Wolof people|Wolof]], [[Fula people|Fula]]/[[Halpulaar]], [[Mankanya people|Mancagne]], [[Manjack people|Manjack]], [[Soninke people|Soninke]], [[Serer people|Serer]], [[Bainouk]], [[Balanta people|Balanta]] and [[Creole peoples|Creole]].  Jola have been the majority of the population in the region since at least 1500, and culturally share much with the people of [[Guinea-Bissau]].  One of three dialects of [[Guinea-Bissau Creole]], ''Cacheu–Ziguinchor'', is centered around the city.  Resistant to first [[Islam]] and later [[Christianity]], many Jola retain a degree of animist practices, while [[Basse Casamance]] is the only majority [[Catholic]] area in [[Senegal]].

==Notable natives and residents==
Ziguinchor is the birthplace of some famous Senegalese people.

==Administration==
[[File:Ziguinchor10.JPG|thumb|Ziguinchor Regional Council]]
In the decades following independence, Ziguinchor was a stronghold of the Socialist Party of Senegal (PS). [[Robert Sagna]], a long-time minister in Socialist Party governments, was also Mayor of Ziguinchor from 1984 to 2009.  In the beginning of 2007 Sagna left the PS and led the [[Taku Défaraat Sénégal]] coalition in a failed presidential bid.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6379847.stm Mame Less Camara, Senegal's presidential contenders], BBC News, 22 February 2007.</ref> In 2001's legislative elections, a big push by President [[Abdoulaye Wade]]'s ruling PDS party, spearheading the ''Sopi'' coalition (joined in 2008 by [[And-Jëf/Pads]]), was led by Ziguinchor politician [[Abdoulaye Baldé (politician)|Abdoulaye Baldé]], a former General Secretary to the President.  In the 2001 elections, the a Ziguinchor [[National Assembly of Senegal|National Assembly]] seat was gained by the PDS, and held again in 2007, prompting speculation that Sagna and his party's days of dominating local politics were numbered.

==Africa Cup of Nations==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2022}}
Ziguinchor was one of the venues for the [[1992 Africa Cup of Nations]] football championship. The city Sports and Arts Associations conceived for the first time the concept of having specific suburbs barracking for each national team in order to give a vibrant and joyful atmosphere to the Football tournament that saw [[Algeria]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Ghana]], [[Zambia]], [[Egypt]], [[Zaire|Congo]] play the first half of the Championship in that city. This successful and original experience inspired other tournament organisers from then on.
