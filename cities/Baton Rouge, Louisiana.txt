The Baton Rouge area owes its historical importance to its strategic site upon the Istrouma Bluff, the first natural [[cliff|bluff]] upriver from the [[Mississippi River Delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. This allowed development of a business quarter safe from seasonal flooding. In addition, it built a [[levee]] system stretching from the bluff southward to protect the riverfront and low-lying agricultural areas.<ref>{{Cite web |title=LSU Libraries - Special Collections - Andrew David Lytle, photographic artist - Baton Rouge: Levee Construction, Mississippi River |url=https://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/exhibits/Lytle/A14.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829112857/https://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/exhibits/Lytle/A14.html |archive-date=August 29, 2008 |access-date=2021-07-29 |website=Louisiana State University}}</ref>

Baton Rouge has developed as a culturally rich center, with settlement by immigrants from numerous European nations and African peoples brought to North America as slaves or indentured servants. It was ruled by seven different nations: the French, Spanish and British in the colonial era; briefly the [[Republic of West Florida]]; the United States as a territory and a state; the [[Confederate States of America]];  and the United States again since the end of the [[American Civil War]]. Throughout the governance of these various occupying national governments of Baton Rouge, the city and its metropolitan area have developed as a multicultural region practicing many religious traditions from [[Catholicism]] to [[Protestantism]] and [[Louisiana Voodoo]].

The early Muskogean societies were the bearers of the [[Mississippian culture]], which formed around 800 AD and extended in a vast network across the Mississippi and Ohio valleys, with numerous [[chiefdom]]s in the Southeast, as well. By the time the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] made their first forays inland from the shores of the Gulf of Mexico in the early 16th century, by some evidence many political centers of the Mississippians were already in decline, or abandoned. At the time, this region appeared to have been occupied by a collection of moderately sized native chiefdoms, interspersed with autonomous villages and tribal groups.<ref name=north_ga>{{cite web

French explorer [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] led an exploration party up the Mississippi River in 1698. The explorers saw a red pole marking the boundary between the [[Houma people|Houma]] and [[Bayagoula]] tribal hunting grounds.

European settlement of Baton Rouge began in 1721 when French colonists established a military and trading post. Since then, Baton Rouge has been governed by France, Britain, Spain, Louisiana, the [[Republic of West Florida]], the United States, the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]], and the United States again. In 1755, when French settlers in the colony of [[Acadia]] (known as [[Acadians]]) were [[Expulsion of the Acadians|deported]] from there by British authorities, many took up residence in rural Louisiana, including Baton Rouge. Popularly known as [[Cajuns]] they maintained a distinct culture for centuries. From 1763 to 1783, Baton Rouge was part of the [[British North America]]n colony of [[West Florida]], though it was captured by [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] forces in [[Battle of Baton Rouge (1779)|in September 1779]]. During the first half of the 19th century, Baton Rouge grew steadily as the result of [[Riverboat|steamboat]] trade and transportation.

===Incorporation and growth===
[[File:Old baton rouge.jpg|thumb|Baton Rouge in 1863]]

Baton Rouge was [[Incorporated town|incorporated]] in 1817. In 1822, the [[Pentagon Barracks]] complex of buildings was completed. The site was used by Spanish, French, and British authorities and was occupied by both the [[Confederate States Army]] and [[United States Army]]. It was also part of the short-lived Republic of West Florida.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/louisiana/pen.htm |title=Pentagon Barracks |access-date=August 12, 2008 |work=National Register of Historic Places |publisher=National Park Service |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615203032/http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/louisiana/pen.htm |archive-date=June 15, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1951, ownership of the barracks was transferred to the state of Louisiana.

Acquisition of Louisiana by the United States in 1803 was a catalyst for increased [[Anglo-Americans|Anglo-American]] settlement, especially in the northern part of the state. In 1846, the state legislature designated Baton Rouge as Louisiana's new capital to replace "sinful" [[New Orleans]]. The architect [[James Dakin]] was hired to design the [[old Louisiana State Capitol]], with construction beginning in late 1847.<ref name="Stocksieker_307"/>

Rather than mimic the [[United States Capitol]], as many other states had done, he designed a capitol in [[Neo-Gothic]] style, complete with turrets and crenellations, and stained glass; it overlooks the Mississippi. It has been described as the "most distinguished example of Gothic Revival" architecture in the state and has been designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]].<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/louisiana/ocap.htm "Old Louisiana State Capitol"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102100106/http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/louisiana/ocap.htm |date=January 2, 2012 }}, National Park Service</ref>

By the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], the population of Baton Rouge was nearly 5,500. The war nearly halted economic progress, except for businesses associated with supplying the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] Army occupation of the city, which began in the spring of 1862 and lasted for the duration of the war. The Confederates at first consolidated their forces elsewhere, during which time the state government moved to [[Opelousas, Louisiana|Opelousas]] and later [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]].<ref name="Stocksieker_307"/> In the summer of 1862, about 2,600 Confederate troops under generals [[John C.

After the war, New Orleans temporarily served as the seat of the [[Reconstruction era]] state government. When the [[Bourbon Democrat]]s regained power in 1882, after considerable intimidation and voter suppression of black Republicans, they returned the state government to Baton Rouge, where it has since remained. In his 1893 guidebook, [[Karl Baedeker]] described Baton Rouge as "the Capital of Louisiana, a quaint old place with 10,378 inhabitants, on a bluff above the Mississippi".<ref>Baedeker, Karl, ed. ''The United States with an Excursion into Mexico: A Handbook for Travelers'', 1893: p. 321 (Reprint by Da Capo Press, New York, 1971)</ref>

With the population growth of European and African-descended peoples in present-day Baton Rouge, the American Indian population declined to one of the smallest minority groups in the area. With the increase among [[people of color]] during the 20th century, Baton Rouge has also declined as a predominantly non-Hispanic white city, hastened by suburbanization, aging out, and [[white flight]]. In 1970, non-Hispanic whites were 70.5% of the population.<ref>{{cite web|title=Louisiana—Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |access-date=April 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archive-date=August 12, 2012 }}</ref> In 2020, they were 34.2% of the total population.

[[Native American religions]] and [[African diaspora religions|Afrodiasporic religions]] were commonplace alongside [[Christianity]] in Baton Rouge's early history. Due to French, Spanish, and British colonization and missionary efforts, in addition to American settlement, Baton Rouge became a predominantly Christian city and metropolitan area. In a 2020 study by the [[Association of Religion Data Archives]], Christianity is the most-practiced religion for the Baton Rouge area, being influenced by [[Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]].

In 2020, ARDA reported there were 61 congregations and 174,410 Catholics within the metropolitan area. The Catholic population is primarily served by the [[Latin Church]]'s [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Baton Rouge]]—a [[suffragan diocese]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans|Roman Catholic Metropolitan Archdiocese of New Orleans]].

==Government==
[[File:East Baton Rouge Parish District Map.png|thumb|A map of East Baton Rouge Parish districts]]

The city of Baton Rouge and the Parish of East Baton Rouge have been run by a consolidated government since 1947. It combined the Baton Rouge municipal government with the rural areas of the parish, allowing people outside the limits of the city of Baton Rouge to use city services. Though the city and parish have a consolidated government, this differs slightly from a traditional [[consolidated city-county]]{{NoteTag|Because the Louisiana uses [[List of parishes in Louisiana|parishes]], the equivalent of a county in other states, in the state this form of government is called a "consolidated city-parish".}} government.

The cities of [[Zachary, Louisiana|Zachary]], [[Baker, Louisiana|Baker]], [[Central, Louisiana|Central]], and [[St. George, Louisiana|St. George]] operate their own city governments within East Baton Rouge Parish. Under this system, Baton Rouge has the uncommon office of "mayor-president", which consolidates the executive offices of "mayor of Baton Rouge" and "president of East Baton Rouge Parish". Though Zachary, Baker, and Central each have their own mayors, citizens living in these municipalities are still a part of the [[constituency]] who can vote and run in elections for mayor-president and metropolitan council.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |url = http://brgov.com/govt/ |title=Baton Rouge Government |publisher=City of Baton Rouge |access-date=June 12, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130728100632/http://brgov.com/govt/ |archive-date=July 28, 2013 |df=mdy }}</ref>

The mayor-president's duties include setting the agenda for the government and managing the government's day-to-day functions.

[[File:Baton Rouge City Council partisan map 2019.svg|thumb|A map of Baton Rouge City Council partisanship|alt=]]

When the city and parish combined government, the city and parish councils consolidated to form the East Baton Rouge Parish Metropolitan Council. The Metropolitan Council is the [[legislative branch]] of the Baton Rouge government. Its 12 district council members are elected from [[single-member districts]]. They elect from among themselves the [[Mayor pro tempore|mayor-president'' pro tempore'']]. The mayor-president pro tempore presides over the council's meetings and assumes the role of the mayor-president if the mayor-president is unable to serve. The council members serve four-year terms and can hold office for three terms.

===Highways and roads===
====Interstates====
Baton Rouge has three interstate highways: [[Interstate 10 in Louisiana|I-10]], [[Interstate 12|I-12]] ([[Republic of West Florida]] Parkway), and [[Interstate 110 (Louisiana)|I-110]] ([[Interstate 110 (Louisiana)|Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway]]).[[File:Baton Rouge Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|[[Horace Wilkinson Bridge]]]]
[[File:Baton Rouge from I-10 Nov 13 C Street.JPG|thumb|Interstate 10]]
Interstate 10 enters the city from the [[Horace Wilkinson Bridge]] over the Mississippi River, curving at an interchange with Interstate 110 southeast, crossing the LSU lakes and Garden District before reaching an interchange with I-12 (referred to as the 10/12 split). It curves further southeast toward [[New Orleans]] as it crosses Essen Lane near the Medical District. It passes Bluebonnet Blvd and the Mall of Louisiana at exit 162, and leaves Baton Rouge after interchanges with Siegen Lane and Highland Road.

Interstate 12 (The [[Republic of West Florida]] Parkway) begins in the city at the I-10/I-12 split east of College Drive, and proceeds eastward, crossing Essen Lane, Airline Hwy, Sherwood Forest Blvd, Millerville Road, and O'neal Lane before leaving the city when crossing the [[Amite River]].

Interstate 110 (The [[List of streets named after Martin Luther King Jr.#Louisiana|Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway]]) stretches 8 miles in a north–south direction from the east end of the Horace Wilkinson Bridge to Scenic Highway in Scotlandville, Louisiana. It passes through downtown, North Baton Rouge, and [[Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport|Baton Rouge Metro Airport]] before ending at Scenic Highway.

====U.S. highways and major roads====
Baton Rouge has two U.S. highways, along with their business counterparts: [[Airline Highway]] ([[US 61]]) and [[Florida Boulevard]].

U.S. 190 enters the city from the [[Huey P. Long Bridge (Baton Rouge)|Huey P. Long Bridge]], beginning a concurrency with U.S. 61 after an interchange with Scenic Highway, near Scotlandville. Its name is Airline Highway from this interchange to the interchange with Florida Blvd. At this interchange, U.S. 190 turns east to follow Florida Blvd through Northeast Baton Rouge, exiting the city at the Amite River.
[[File:Huey P. Long Bridge at night (Baton Rouge, Louisiana) recolorized.jpg|thumb|[[Huey P. Long Bridge (Baton Rouge)|Huey P. Long Bridge]]]]
U.S. 61 enters Baton Rouge as Scenic Highway until it reaches Airline Highway (U.S. 190). It becomes concurrent with U.S. 190 until Florida Blvd, where it continues south, still called Airline Highway. It passes through Goodwood and Broadmoor before an interchange with I-12. It continues southeast past Bluebonnet Blvd/Coursey Blvd, Jefferson Hwy, and Sherwood Forest Blvd/Siegen Lane before exiting the city at Bayou Manchac.

U.S. 61/190 Business runs west along Florida Boulevard (known as Florida Street from Downtown east to Mid City) from Airline Highway to River Road in downtown. The cosigned routes run from Florida St. north along River Road, passing the [[Louisiana State Capitol]] and Capitol Park Complex before intersecting with Choctaw Drive. North of this intersection River Road becomes Chippewa Street and curves to the East. U.S. 61/190 Business leaves Chippewa Street at its intersection with Scenic Highway. The route follows Scenic Highway to Airline Highway, where it ends. North of Airline on Scenic and East of Scenic Highway on Airline is US 61. U.S. 190 is East and West of Scenic on Airline Highway.

These are important surface streets with designated state highway numbers: Greenwell Springs Road ([[LA 37]]), Plank Road/22nd Street ([[LA 67]]), Burbank Drive/Highland Road ([[LA 42]]), Nicholson Drive ([[LA 30]]), Jefferson Highway/Government Street ([[LA 73]]), Scotlandville/Baker/Zachary Highway ([[LA 19]]), Essen Lane ([[LA 3064]]), Bluebonnet Blvd/Coursey Blvd ([[LA 1248]]), Siegen Lane/Sherwood Forest Blvd ([[LA 3246]]), and Perkins Road/Acadian Thruway ([[LA 427]]).

====Traffic issues and highway upgrades====
According to the 2008 INRIX National Traffic Scorecard, which ranks the top 100 congested metropolitan areas in the U.S., Baton Rouge was the 33rd-most congested metro area in the country. At a population rank of 67 out of 100, it has the second-highest ratio of population rank to congestion rank, higher than even the [[Los Angeles]]-[[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]]-[[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]] metropolitan area, indicating a remarkably high level of congestion for the comparatively low population. According to the Scorecard, Baton Rouge was the only area out of all 100 to show an increase in congestion from 2007 to 2008 (+ 6%). The city also tied for the highest jump in congestion rank over the same period (14 places).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://scorecard.inrix.com/scorecard/Top100Metros.asp |title = INRIX National Traffic Scorecard |website = Scorecard.inrix.com |access-date = April 27, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110713040047/http://scorecard.inrix.com/scorecard/Top100Metros.asp |archive-date = July 13, 2011 |url-status = live }}</ref>

Interstate 12 used to have a major bottleneck at O'Neal Lane. The interstate was three lanes wide in each direction to the O'Neal Lane exit, where the interstate abruptly became two lanes in each direction and crossed the narrow Amite River Bridge. This stretch of road, called "a deathtrap"<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/8124837.html |title=I-12 accidents piling up |website = 2theadvocate.com |access-date=April 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090703184214/http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/8124837.html |archive-date=July 3, 2009 }}</ref> by one lawmaker, had become notorious for traffic accidents, many with fatalities. In 2007, ten people died in traffic accidents within a three-month period on this section of road.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/46588277.html |title=More funds sought for I-12 widening project |website=2theadvocate.com |access-date=April 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090608014023/http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/46588277.html |archive-date=June 8, 2009 }}</ref>

In 2009, Governor [[Bobby Jindal]] and the Baton Rouge legislative delegation allocated state and federal funding to widen I-12 from O'Neal Lane to Range Avenue (Exit 10) in Denham Springs. The construction was completed in 2012 and has significantly improved the flow of traffic.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/44106607.html |title=I-12 work to begin |website = 2theadvocate.com |access-date=April 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504055117/http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/44106607.html |archive-date=May 4, 2009 }}</ref> In 2010, The [[American Reinvestment and Recovery Act]] provided committed federal funds to widen I-12 from the Range Avenue Exit to [[Walker, Louisiana]]. Noticing the significant improvement in commute times, Jindal further funded widening to Satsuma, Louisiana.

Interstate 10 West at Bluebonnet Road also ranked within the top 1000 bottlenecks for 2008, and I-10 East at Essen Lane and Nicholson Drive ranked not far out of the top 1000. A new exit to the [[Mall of Louisiana]] was created in 2006, and the interstate was widened between Bluebonnet Blvd and Siegen Lane. But the stretch of I-10 from the I-10/I-12 split to Bluebonnet Blvd was not part of these improvements and remained heavily congested during peak hours. In response, a widening project totaling at least $87 million began in late 2008. Interstate 10 was widened to three lanes over a five-year period between the I-10/I-12 split and Highland Road.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/37052144.html |title=Project on I-10 to begin |website=2theadvocate.com |access-date=April 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090703184144/http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/37052144.html |archive-date=July 3, 2009 }}</ref> In 2010, the [[American Reinvestment and Recovery Act]] provided supplemental funding for this project to extend to the Highland Road exit in [[East Baton Rouge Parish]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.geauxwider.com/ |title=Geaux Wider |publisher=Geaux Wider |access-date=April 27, 2011 |archive-url = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20110315155522/http://www.geauxwider.com/ |archive-date= March 15, 2011 |url-status = live }}</ref>

Surface streets in Baton Rouge are prone to severe congestion. But roads are beginning to handle the number of vehicles using them after years of stagnation in road upgrades. Baton Rouge Mayor [[Kip Holden]] has instituted an extensive upgrade of East Baton Rouge Parish roads known as the Green Light Plan, geared toward improving areas of congestion on the city's surface streets. With its first project completed in 2008, it has seen numerous others reach completion as of 2015, with several more under construction and still others yet to break ground.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://greenlight.csrsonline.com/ |title=The Green Light Plan |website=Greenlight.csrsonline.com |access-date=April 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708211842/http://greenlight.csrsonline.com/ |archive-date=July 8, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

A circumferential loop [[freeway]] was proposed for the greater Baton Rouge metro area to help alleviate congestion on the existing through-town routes. The proposed loop would pass through the outlying parishes of [[Livingston Parish, Louisiana|Livingston]] (running alongside property owned and marketed as an industrial development by Al Coburn, a member of President Mike Grimmer's staff), Ascension, West Baton Rouge, and Iberville, as well as northern East Baton Rouge Parish. This proposal has been subject to much contention, particularly by residents living in the outer parishes through which the loop would pass.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/44842827.html |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090703184149/http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/44842827.html |archive-date=July 3, 2009 |title=Poll shows public support for loop |website = 2theadvocate.com |date=May 12, 2009 |access-date=April 27, 2011 }}</ref>
