'''Banha''' ({{langx|arz|بنها}} {{IPA|arz|ˈbænhæ|}}; {{Langx|cop|ⲡⲁⲛⲁϩⲟ}}, {{IPA-cop|ˈpɑnɑho|Late Coptic}}) is the capital of the [[Qalyubiyya Governorate]] in north-eastern [[Egypt]]. Between the capital of [[Cairo]] and the city of [[Tanta]], Banha is an important transport hub, as rail lines from Cairo to various cities in the Nile Delta pass through it and Benha it's a part of The  [[Greater Cairo]]. Banha was founded as a city in 1850.

==Etymology==
{{hiero|pr nhꜣ<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wallis Budge |first1=E. A. |title=An Egyptian hieroglyphic dictionary: with an index of English words, king list and geological list with indexes, list of hieroglyphic characters, coptic and semitic alphabets, etc. Vol II |date=1920 |publisher=[[John Murray (publishing house)|John Murray]] |page=[https://archive.org/details/egyptianhierogly02budguoft/page/989 989] |url=https://archive.org/details/egyptianhierogly02budguoft}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Gauthier |first1=Henri |title=Dictionnaire des Noms Géographiques Contenus dans les Textes Hiéroglyphiques Vol. 2 |date=1925 |page=[https://archive.org/details/Gauthier1925_2/page/n51 95] |url=https://archive.org/details/Gauthier1925_2}}</ref>|<hiero>O1:Z1-M1</hiero>|align=left}}
The city's modern name derives from ''Banaho'' ({{langx|cop|ⲡⲁⲛⲁϩⲟ}}) from ''Per neha'' ({{langx|egy|pr-nha}}), which means 'House of Sycamore ({{langx|cop|ⲛⲟⲩϩⲓ}})'.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ancient Egyptian and Coptic elements in the toponomy of contemporary Egypt|last=Czapkiewicz|pages=44}}</ref>

==Geography==
It is located {{convert|48|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Cairo]]. located on the east bank of the [[Damietta]] Branch of the [[Nile River]] in the rich farmland of the southern part of the river's delta. Banha is a major junction in the rail network that radiates north from [[Cairo]] and it has the 6th biggest train station in Egypt.

The north of Benha is the site of one of several ancient cities called [[Athribis]], the capital of the tenth [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]] (province) of [[Lower Egypt]] in about 1500 BC. The site has never been systematically investigated by archaeologists. Over the years, peasants digging in the area have uncovered a large hoard of silver.

Athribis was the center of worship of the black bull and enjoyed the most popularity during the Roman period of rule in Egypt. Not much still stands of this ancient capital except some remains from the 18th to the 26th Dynasties. Though not a popular tourist destination, there are such sites here as a Greco-Roman cemetery and silver ingots discovered at the Athribis site currently on display at the Egyptian Museum.

About {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Banha is Tall al Yahudiya, the site of [[Leontopolis]], famed for its glazed tiles in ancient times. Population is around 2,479,347 (2005) and total area is 16.105&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.
