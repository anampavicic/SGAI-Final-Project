'''An Giang''' is a [[Provinces of Vietnam|province]] of [[Vietnam]]. It is located in the [[Mekong Delta]], in the southwestern part of the country.

== Geography ==
[[File:Nui Cam muaa.jpg|thumb|left|Harvest in [[Tịnh Biên]], An Giang]]
An Giang occupies a position in the upper reaches of the [[Mekong Delta]]. The [[Bassac River|Hậu Giang]] and [[Tiền River|Tiền Giang]] branches of the [[Mekong River]] are the dominant geographical features of the province. With the exception of the west, most of An Giang is fairly flat and is criss-crossed by many canals and small rivers. This terrain has led to An Giang being a significant agricultural center, producing significant quantities of [[rice]].

The Cấm Mountains, also known as the [[Thất Sơn]] range or the "Seven Mountains", are located in the western [[Tịnh Biên District]]. Followers of the [[Bửu Sơn Kỳ Hương]] tradition, founded in An Giang in 1849, refer to these mountains as ''Bửu Sơn'', "Precious Mountains".

== Administrative divisions ==
An Giang is subdivided into 11 district-level sub-divisions:

* Districts:
# [[An Phú District|An Phú]]: 3 towns and 11 rural communes
# [[Châu Phú District|Châu Phú]]: 2 town and 11 rural communes
# [[Châu Thành District, An Giang|Châu Thành]]: 2 town and 11 rural communes
# [[Chợ Mới District, An Giang|Chợ Mới]]: 3 towns and 15 rural communes
# [[Phú Tân District, An Giang|Phú Tân]]: 2 towns and 16 rural communes
# [[Thoại Sơn District|Thoại Sơn]]: 3 towns and 14 rural communes
# [[Tri Tôn District|Tri Tôn]]: 3 towns and 12 rural communes
* District-level town:
# [[Tân Châu, An Giang|Tân Châu]]: 5 wards and 9 rural communes
# [[Tịnh Biên District|Tịnh Biên]]: 7 wards and 7 rural communes
* Provincial cities:
# [[Châu Đốc]]: 5 wards and 2 rural communes
# [[Long Xuyên]]: 11 wards and 2 rural communes (capital of province)

* They are further subdivided into 18 [[Commune-level subdivisions (Vietnam)|commune-level]] towns (or townlets), 110 communes, and 28 wards (156 in total).
== Demographics ==
[[File:Núi ở An Giang.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cam Mountains]]]]

An Giang first became a province in 1832, having been settled by the Vietnamese migrants moving southwards in search of new land. It is believed that An Giang was once an important center of the 1st millennium [[Óc Eo]] culture, presumably owing to its position on the river. Traditionally, An Giang has been known for its [[silk]] industry.

An Giang is home to a substantial<!-- This word was "sizable", but that's an American-only spelling. It seems preferable to avoid a word with different British and American spellings. Another possibility is "large". --> number of people from [[List of ethnic groups in Vietnam|Vietnam's ethnic minorities]]. Due to the province's proximity to Cambodia, the [[Khmer Krom]] are the largest non-Vietnamese group of the province. Other groups, such as the [[Chams]] and ethnic Chinese ([[Hoa people|Hoa]]), are also found in An Giang.

As of 2020, An Giang Province covers an area of 3,536.83 square kilometers with a population of 1,904,532 people, resulting in a population density of 539 people per square kilometer.<ref name="ANGIANG2020">{{Cite web |date=May 5, 2021 |title=Statistical Yearbook 2021 (57 - AN GIANG PROVINCE STATISTICAL OFFICE/ Population and area of An Giang Province as of December 31, 2020, page 397) |url=https://www.gso.gov.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Nien-giam-TC-2021.pdf |website=General Statistics Office of Vietnam}}</ref>
