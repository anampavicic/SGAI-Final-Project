At the 2016 census, its population was 529,673.<ref name="2016 census"/> Since 2017, the historical city of Yazd is recognized as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ifpnews.com/exclusive/historical-city-yazd-inscribed-world-heritage-site/|title=Historical City of Yazd Inscribed as World Heritage Site|date=9 July 2017|access-date=1 January 2018}}</ref>

Because of generations of adaptations to its desert surroundings, Yazd has a unique [[Persian architecture]]. It is nicknamed the "City of [[Windcatcher]]s" ({{lang|fa|شهر بادگیرها}} ''Shahr-e Badgirha'') from its many examples. It is also very well known for its [[Zoroastrian]] [[fire temple]]s, [[ab anbar]]s (cisterns), [[qanat]]s (underground channels), [[yakhchal]]s (coolers), [[Persian handicrafts]], [[Termeh|handwoven cloth]] (''Persian termeh''), [[silk]] weaving, [[Pashmak|Persian cotton candy]], and its time-honored confectioneries. Yazd is also known as City of Bicycles, because of its old history of bike riders, and the highest number of bicycles per capita in Iran. It is reported that [[bicycle culture]] in Iran originated in Yazd as a result of contact with European visitors and tourists in the last{{which|date=June 2023}} century.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://ghoolabad.com/index1.asp?id=5|title=Bicycle history in Yazd |date= 11 February 2009|access-date=23 November 2018}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Yazd'' means "pure" and "holy"; Yazd City means "City of the Holy [One, ''i.&nbsp;e.'', God]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://jadvalyab.ir/dehkhoda/یزد|title=یزد|author=JadvalYab.ir|website=JadvalYab.ir|access-date=2021-03-06|quote=با ایزد و یزدان همریشه است و معنی آن پاک و مقدس و درخور تحسین و آفریننده ٔ خوبیهاست و نام شهر یزداز آن است.&rlm;}}</ref> Former names of this city: Kath, Isatis.

== History ==
{{For timeline}}
Archeological evidence 12 kilometers north of Yazd suggests that the area has been populated since the period of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (550 BC–330 BC).{{sfn|Choksy|2020|p=222}} In his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', [[Pliny the Elder]] (died 79 AD) mentions a town in the [[Parthian Empire]] (247 BC–224 AD) named "Issatis", which is seemingly connected to the name of the [[Sagartians|Asagarta/Istachae/Sagartians]].{{sfn|Choksy|2020|p=222–223}} As a result, some scholars have suggested that the name of Yazd was derived from Issatis (also transliterated as Isatichae, Ysatis, Yasatis), and that the latter name started to be used in the [[Medes|Median]] or Achaemenid eras.{{sfn|Choksy|2020|p=223}}

The area encompassing Yazd first started to gain prominence in the [[Late antiquity]], namely under the [[Sasanian Empire]] (224–651). Under [[Yazdegerd I]] ({{reign|399|420}}), a mint was established in Yazd (under the mint abbreviation of "YZ"), which demonstrates its increasing importance.{{sfn|Choksy|2020|p=227}} According to the [[New Persian]] chronicle ''Tarikh-i Yazd'' ("History of Yazd") of 1441, Yazd was re-founded by "Yazdegerd, son of Bahram", i.e. [[Yazdegerd II]] ({{reign|438|457}}).{{sfn|Choksy|2020|p=225}} The word ''yazd'' means God.<ref>Steingass, Francis Joseph. [http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.7:1:7557.steingass A Comprehensive Persian-English dictionary, including the Arabic words and phrases to be met with in Persian literature]. London: Routledge & K. Paul, 1892.</ref> After the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Muslim conquest]], many Zoroastrians migrated to Yazd from neighboring provinces. By paying a levy, Yazd was allowed to remain Zoroastrian even after its conquest, and [[Islam]] only gradually became the dominant religion in the city.

Due to its secluded desert setting and challenging access, Yazd was mostly spared from major conflicts and the devastation and havoc of warfare. For instance, it was a haven for those fleeing from destruction in other parts of [[Persian Empire]] during the [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol invasion]]. In 1272 it was visited by [[Marco Polo]], who remarked on the city's fine [[Silk weaving|silk-weaving]] industry. In the book ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]'', he described Yazd in the following way:

{{Blockquote|It is a good and noble city, and has a great amount of trade. They weave there quantities of a certain silk tissue known as Yasdi, which merchants carry into many quarters to dispose of. When you leave this city to travel further, you ride for seven days over great plains, finding harbour to receive you at three places only. There are many fine woods producing dates upon the way, such as one can easily ride through; and in them there is great sport to be had in hunting and hawking, there being partridges and quails and abundance of other game, so that the merchants who pass that way have plenty of diversion. There are also wild asses, handsome creatures. At the end of those seven marches over the plain, you come to a fine kingdom which is called [[Kerman]].}}

Yazd briefly served as the capital of the [[Muzaffarids (Iran)|Muzaffarid Dynasty]] in the fourteenth century, and was unsuccessfully besieged in 1350–1351 by the [[Injuids]] under Shaikh Abu Ishaq. The Friday (or Congregation) mosque, arguably the city's greatest architectural landmark, as well as other important buildings, date to this period. During the [[Qajar Iran|Qajar Empire]] (18th century AD) it was ruled by the [[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiari]] Khans.

Under the rule of the [[Safavid Iran|Safavid Empire]] (16th century), some people migrated from Yazd and settled in an area that is today on the Iran-Afghanistan border. The settlement, which was named Yazdi, was located in what is now [[Farah, Afghanistan|Farah City]] in the [[Farah Province|province]] of the same name in [[Afghanistan]]. Even today, people from this area speak with an accent very similar to that of the people of Yazd.

One of the notable things about Yazd is its family-centered culture. According to official statistics from Iran's National Organization for Civil Registration, Yazd is among the three cities with the lowest divorce rates in Iran.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

=== Language and ethnicity ===
The majority of the people of Yazd are [[Persians]]. They speak [[Persian language|Persian]] with a Yazdi accent, which is different from the Persian accent of [[Tehrani accent|Tehran]].

During the Pahlavi era, a large group of Kurds from the Gulbaghi tribe were moved from the north of [[Kurdistan province]] to the city of Yazd and the cities of Isfahan, Kashan, and Nayin. Today, the Gulbaghi tribe are mostly assimilated elements in the population of these cities.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://journal.sulicihan.edu.krd/index.php/sjcus/article/view/153 | doi=10.25098/6.3.21 | date=2022 | journal=The Scientific Journal of Cihan University – Sulaimanyia | volume=6 | issue=3 | title=سیاست های ایلیاتی پهلوی اول برابر گلباغی ها | pages=391–404 | last1=Ahmadi | first1=Mansur | doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://rojanpress.ir/main/1219-%DA%A9%DB%8C%D9%86%D9%87-%D8%B1%D8%B6%D8%A7-%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%B7%D9%88%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%81-%D9%88-%D8%B9%D8%B4%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1-%DA%AF%D9%87%E2%80%8C%D9%84%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AE%DB%8C/-%D9%86%D9%87-%DA%AF%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%BA%DB%8C-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AF-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86%D8%AC%D8%A7-%D9%86%D9%87-%D9%87%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%A2%D9%86%D8%AC%D8%A7.html | title=کینه رضا شاه از طوایف و عشایر گه‌لواخی/ نه گلباغی ماند اینجا نه همدانی آنجا | date=8 May 1402 }}</ref>

=== Religion ===
The majority of people in Yazd are [[Shia Muslim|Shia Muslims]]. Yazd is a strongly religious, traditionalist and conservative city.<ref>{{Cite book|title=[[Iran: From Religious Dispute to Revolution]]|author=Michael M. J. Fischer|year=2003|editor=University of Wisconsin Press|p=XV|ISBN=9780299184735}}</ref> Several city traditions are the Muslim parades and gatherings, which are mainly processions called ''azadari'' held to commemorate the events experienced by the main Islamic martyrs and other important figures. These huge public gatherings created a series of spaces which, since most are near important urban monuments, are used at other times as hubs from which visitors can tour the main spots in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hamshahrionline.ir/details/192235 |title=همشهری آنلاین: آشنایی با برخی آئین‌‌های عزاداری در استان یزد |publisher=Hamshahrionline.ir |date=2013-12-04 |access-date=2013-12-09}}</ref>

There is also a sizable population of [[Zoroastrians]] in the city. In 2013, [[Sepanta Niknam]] was elected to the city council of Yazd and became the first Zoroastrian councillor in Iran.<ref>{{citation|title=Iran Suspends Zoroastrian Member of Yazd City Council|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/10/09/world/middleeast/ap-ml-iran-religious-minorities.html|access-date=9 October 2017|date=9 October 2017|work=The Associated Press|publisher=The New York Times}}</ref> The Pir-e-Naraki<ref>{{cite web|author=Ed Eduljee |url=http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/worship/setinaraki.htm |title=Pir-e Seti.

The story of the last Persian prince to come to Yazd before the arrival of [[Islam]] adds to its importance. Such a transformation has occurred several times.{{clarify|date=February 2015}}<!--What transformation?

There was once a relatively large Jewish-Yazdi community, however, after the creation of [[Israel]], many have moved there for varying reasons. Former president of Israel [[Moshe Katsav]] is an example.

[[File:Tower of Silence, Yazd 11.jpg|thumb|[[Yazd Tower of Silence]]]]
[[File:آتشکده یزد 2.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Fire Temple of Yazd]]]]
Yazd is an important centre of [[Persian architecture|Iranian architecture]]. Because of its climate, it has one of the largest networks of ''[[qanat]]s'' (underground water supply systems) in the world, and Yazdi ''qanat'' makers are considered the most skilled in Iran.

To deal with the extremely hot summers, many old buildings in Yazd have magnificent [[windcatcher|wind tower]]s and large underground areas.

The city is also home to prime examples of ''[[yakhchal]]s'', which were used to store ice retrieved from glaciers in the nearby mountains. Yazd is also one of the largest cities built almost entirely out of [[adobe]].

Yazd's heritage as a center of Zoroastrianism is also important. There is a [[Tower of Silence]] on the outskirts, and the city has an ''[[Fire temple|ateshkadeh]]'' which holds a fire that has been kept alight continuously since 470 AD. Zoroastrians make up a small minority of the population of Yazd, around 1,000 out of 600,000.

The 11th-century brick mausoleum and shrine [[Davāzdah Imām]] is the oldest dated building in the city.<ref name="Anisi">{{Cite journal|last=Anisi|first=Alireza|title=The Davāzdah Imām Mausoleum at Yazd: A Re-Examination|date=2009|journal=Iran|volume=47|pages=57–68|doi=10.1080/05786967.2009.11864759|jstor=25651464|s2cid=193321386|issn=0578-6967}}</ref>

Built in 12th century and still in use, [[Jame Mosque of Yazd]] is an example of the finest Persian [[mosaic]]s and excellent architecture. Its minarets are the highest in the country. [[Tomb of Sayyed Rukn ad-Din]] is nearby the mosque.

== Economy ==
Always known for the quality of its silk and carpets, Yazd today is one of Iran's industrial centers for textiles. There is also a considerable ceramics and construction materials industry and unique confectionery and jewellery industries. A significant portion of the population is also employed in other industries including agriculture, dairy, metal works, and machine manufacturing. There are a number of companies involved in the growing information technology industry, mainly manufacturing primary materials such as cables and connectors. Currently Yazd is the home of the largest manufacturer of fibre optics in Iran.{{citation needed| date=August 2018}}

Yazd's confectioneries have a tremendous following throughout Iran and have been a source of tourism for the city. Confectioners workshops (''khalifehs'', or experts) keep their recipes a guarded secret, and there are many that have remained a private family business for many generations. [[Baklava]], [[ghotab]] and [[pashmak]] are the most popular sweets made in the city.

In 2000 the Yazd Water Museum opened;<ref>[http://www.qanat.info/en/museam.php]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626164909/http://www.qanat.info/en/museam.php|date=June 26, 2007}}</ref> it features exhibits of water storage vessels and historical technologies related to water.

Yazd has expanded its industrial fields since the 1980s. With at least three main industrial areas each containing over 70 different factories, Yazd has become one of the most technologically advanced cities of Iran.
