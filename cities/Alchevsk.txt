'''Alchevsk''' ({{langx|uk|Алчевськ}}; {{langx|ru|Алчевск}}) is a city and the nominal administrative center of [[Alchevsk Raion]] in [[Luhansk Oblast]], in the [[Donbas]] region of eastern [[Ukraine]]. It is located {{convert|45|km|0|abbr=off}} from the administrative center of the oblast, [[Luhansk]]. Population: {{Ua-pop-est2022|106,062|.}}

[[File:АМЗ.JPG|thumb|Alchevsk Iron and Steel Works]]
Alchevsk is one of the largest industrial centers in the Donbas, and comprises a quarter of the entire oblast's production. Its economy depends on the companies of OJSC "Alchevsk Iron & Steel Works" (a trade blockade by Ukrainian activists during the [[War in Donbas (2014–2022)|war in Donbas]] has all but halted production of this plant in February 2017)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unian.info/economics/1794336-steelmakers-in-occupied-donbas-cease-work-due-to-trade-blockade-in-ukraine.html|title=Steelmakers in occupied Donbas cease work due to trade blockade in Ukraine}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unian.info/economics/1795312-weeks-balance-blockade-causing-losses-nbus-anti-crisis-measures-and-increased-industrial-output.html|title=Week's balance: Blockade causing losses, NBU's anti-crisis measures, and increased industrial output}}</ref> and "Alchevsk Coke-Chemical Plant".

The city was known as '''Voroshylovsk''' ({{langx|uk|Ворошиловськ}}) from 1931 to 1961, and then '''Kommunarsk''' ({{langx|uk|Комунарськ}}) until 1991. Alchevsk came under control of pro-Russian separatists in early 2014, and was incorporated into the self-proclaimed [[Luhansk People's Republic]] (LPR / LNR). After declaring its [[Russian annexation of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts|annexation of the region]] in 2022, [[Russia]] has claimed the city.

==History==
[[File:St. Nicholas Cathedral, Alchevsk, 280520081212.jpg|thumb|St. Nicholas Cathedral]]
[[File:Director house, Alchevsk, 05042008956.jpg|thumb|Director house]]
[[File:Factory clinic, Alchevsk. 010520081143.jpg|thumb|Factory clinic]] 
Alchevsk was founded in 1895 with the establishment of an iron works and named after the Russian industrialist [[Oleksiy Alchevsky]] who founded the Donetsk–Yuryev Metallurgical Society.<ref name="Pospelov">Pospelov, p.&nbsp;27</ref>

A local newspaper is published in the city since 1930.<ref>№ 2903. Огни коммунизма // Летопись периодических и продолжающихся изданий СССР 1986 – 1990. Часть 2. Газеты. М., «Книжная палата», 1994. стр.381</ref>

In 1931, Alchevsk was renamed '''Voroshylovsk''', after [[Kliment Voroshilov]], a Soviet military and party figure.<ref name="Pospelov" />

During [[World War II]], in 1942–1943, the German occupiers operated a [[Gestapo]] prison in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&tab=7&id=806|title=Gestapogefängnis Alcevs'k|website=Bundesarchiv.de|access-date=27 December 2022|language=de}}</ref>

As Voroshilov's personality cult was diminishing, the town was renamed '''Kommunarsk''' in 1961.<ref name="Pospelov" /> After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the original name was restored in 1991.<ref name="Pospelov" />

===Winter disaster of 2006===
On 22 January 2006, the city's [[district heating]] system collapsed, in what [[Luhansk Governor]] [[Gennady Moskal]] described as "the worst [[man-made hazards|man-made disaster]] in [[Ukrainian independence|the history of independent Ukraine]]" ({{langx|uk|найгіршою антропогенною катастрофою в історії незалежної України}}).<ref name=Depot>{{cite news|url=https://dn.depo.ua/ukr/dn/drugiy-alchevsk-cherez-dnr-avdiyivka-z-25-tisyachami-zhiteliv-na-mezhi-katastrofi-20170130510061|work=DepoДонбас [Donbass Depot]|script-title=uk:Другий Алчевськ: Через "ДНР" Авдіївка з 25 тисячами жителів на межі катастрофи|trans-title=A Second Alchevsk: the "DPR" has brought Avdiyivka, with 25&nbsp;000 inhabitants, to the brink of disaster|lang=uk|location=Donbass|date=30 Jan 2017}}</ref><ref name=YIR/> It has subsequently become a metonym in Ukrainian political discourse for cities without [[utility services]],<ref name=Depot/><ref name=BBC/> particularly during [[Russian strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure (2022–present)|Russian infrastructural attacks in the 2020s invasion]].<ref name=BBC>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/features-63516119|publisher=[[BBC]] Ukraine|script-title=uk:Замерзле місто України.

The system had already collapsed once before: in 1972, when the sole [[boiler]] failed. Contemporary [[Soviet]] authorities had authorized a second, back-up boiler, but did not further decentralize the system to preserve [[economies of scale]].<ref name=ZN>{{cite news|url=https://zn.ua/ukr/politcs_archive/alchevsk_lodovikoviy_period.html|work=ZN.UA|script-title=uk:Алчевськ.

In 2006, an underground [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]] cracked in unusually cold weather (nearly {{val|-30|ul=°C}}), isolating the main [[boiler]] from the system. The heat authority delayed draining the [[working fluid]], and water throughout the system froze and burst additional pipes, some inside the walls of residential apartments. Consequently, many apartments could not be heated even after the boilers were restored to working order. Inhabitants turned to electric [[space heater]]s to fill the gap, but these overloaded the grid, leading to [[rolling blackout]]s.<ref name=BBC/><ref name=ZN/> Some attempted to reuse [[gas oven]]s as space heaters,<ref name=BBC/> accentuating the effects of [[2005–2006 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute|a Russian gas boycott]].<ref name=YIR>{{cite news|url=https://24tv.ua/chim-ukrayini-zapamyatavsya-2006-rik-novini-alchevska_n1707518#%D0%93%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%20%D0%B2%D1%96%D0%B9%D0%BD%D0%B0%20%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%96%D1%97%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B8%20%D0%A3%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%97%D0%BD%D0%B8|publisher=Channel 24|department=Ukraine at 30|script-title=uk:Газова війна Росії, прем'єрство Януковича й курйози Черновецького: чим запам'ятався 2006 рік|trans-title=Russia's War by Gas, Yanukovych's Premiership, and Chernovetskiy's Experiments: 2006's top hits|lang=uk|date=11 August 2021|author=Konko, Andrei [Андрій Конько]|at=Item 4}}</ref> Without liquid [[tap water]], the [[sewer system]] also froze and burst a few days later.<ref name=Depot/>  

The crisis was particularly urgent for the Ukrainian government, because parliament would hold [[2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election|elections in March]].<ref name=BBC/> The authorities temporarily evacuated schoolchildren from the area to [[Crimea]] and Western Ukraine, but struggled to organize an extensive repair effort.<ref name=BBC/><ref name=ZN/> Workers imported to repair the apartments found themselves in substandard housing with inconsistent meals.<ref name=ZN/> Nevertheless, immediate repair actions were complete by mid-February.<ref name=BBC/>  

Later that year, [[Viktor Yushchenko|President Yushchenko]] announced a plan to further harden the system against stress with a set of nine distributed boilers.<ref name=ZN/>

===War in Donbas (2014–present)===

In June 2020, as part of the reform of administrative divisions in Ukraine, Alchevsk was made the administrative center of [[Alchevsk Raion]]. This new status is not recognized by the pro-Russian occupation authorities.

After the [[Russian annexation of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts|2022 Russian annexations of Southern and Eastern Ukraine]], the city is now claimed by Russia itself.
