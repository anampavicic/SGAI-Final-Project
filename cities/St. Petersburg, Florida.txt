{{For timeline}}

===Early Spanish exploration===
When the Spanish first arrived in the area of Tampa Bay, they encountered people of the [[Safety Harbor culture]]. About 20 sites with [[Safety Harbor culture#Temple mounds|temple mounds]] have been found around Tampa Bay, with several in Pinellas County. Best known of the Safety Harbor people was the chiefdom of [[Tocobaga]], which was likely located at the [[Safety Harbor site]] in [[Philippe Park]] in northern Pinellas County. The [[Pánfilo de Narváez]] expedition landed on the shores of [[Boca Ciega Bay]] at the [[Jungle Prada Site]] on April 14, 1528. It was the first inland exploration of North America. Of 300 men on the expedition only four survived. One of the survivors of the expedition, [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]], wrote the first book describing the peoples, wildlife, flora and fauna of inland North America in his ''Relacion'', published in Spain in 1542.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Perry |first=Mac |date=September–October 1993 |title=Making the Mounds |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nge8ww8jizMC&dq=tocobaga+tampa+bay&pg=PA60 |url-status=live |journal=Tampa Bay Magazine |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=60–61 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230102200812/https://books.google.com/books?id=nge8ww8jizMC&pg=PA60&dq=tocobaga+tampa+bay&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj-koe4zqn8AhX4nGoFHc2RCUQQ6AF6BAgBEAM#v=onepage&q=tocobaga%20tampa%20bay&f=false |archive-date=January 2, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=MacDougald |first=James | title= ''The Pánfilo de Narváez Expedition of 1528: Highlights of the Expedition and Determination of the Landing Place''|year=2018 |publisher= Marsden House |location=St. Petersburg | isbn= 978-1-4834-8671-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Adorno|first=Rolena|title=Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca: His Account, His Life, and the Expedition of Panfilo de Narváez|author2=Pautz, Patrick|date=1999-09-15|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|isbn=978-0-8032-1463-7|location=Lincoln}}, 3 vols.</ref>

In 1914, [[Al Lang]] invited the [[St. Louis Browns]] to move their spring training into the city, then worked tirelessly to make Grapefruit League training in and around St. Petersburg the destination for baseball teams and their fans by the 1920s.

The city and its tourism industry burgeoned in the 1920s, with up to a quarter million visitors annually coming from Canada, the North and the Midwest by automobile, yacht, and railroad. The city was the principal [[Gulf Coast]] destination for long-distance trains of the [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad]]'s ''[[Southland (train)|Southland]]'' (from Chicago and Cincinnati) and ''Gulf Coast Limited''<ref>{{cite journal |title=Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, Tables 4, 13 |journal=Official Guide of the Railways |publisher=National Railway Publication Company |volume=64 |issue=9 |date=February 1932}}</ref> (from New York, succeeded by the ''[[Champion (train)#Atlantic Coast Line|West Coast Champion]]''), and [[Seaboard Air Line Railroad]] trains such as the ''Southern States Special''<ref>{{cite journal |title=Seaboard Air Line Railway, Tables 2, 4 |journal=Official Guide of the Railways |publisher=National Railway Publication Company |volume=64 |issue=9 |date=February 1932}}</ref> (from New York, succeeded by the ''[[Silver Meteor]]''). Travel time from across the bay was cut due to the [[Gandy Bridge]]'s opening in 1924, allowing direct access to Tampa and the rest of central Florida.

The city took on a Mediterranean flair, with [[Old Spanish Trail (auto trail)|Old Spanish Trail]] style architecture promoted by [[Snell Isle]] founder Perry Snell, whose new country club island homes adopted many elements of Moorish design.

The St. Petersburg flag was created in 1927 and was designed by Mayor C.J. Maurer along with a committee of other public officials. It featured an array of colors symbolic of St. Pete's culture including the sunshine, water and land. The idea came after officials called for a new logo which later became the design for the flag. The pelican featured in the center became a symbol for the "Feed the Pelican Fund" which has supported the birds during the winter months.<ref>{{cite web |title=St. Petersburg, Florida (U.S.) |url=https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us-fl-sp.html#:~:text=of%20David%20B.-,St.,a%20municipal%20flag)%2C%20Commissioner%20R.%20C. |website=CRW Flags |access-date=11 September 2020 |archive-date=August 24, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200824195440/https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/Flags/us-fl-sp.html#:~:text=of%20David%20B.-,St.,a%20municipal%20flag)%2C%20Commissioner%20R.%20C. |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Interstate 275 (Florida)|I-275]] was expanded across [[Tampa Bay|the bay]] from [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] through St. Petersburg in the 1970s. Additional spurs [[Interstate 175|I-175]] and [[Interstate 375 (Florida)|I-375]] were built afterward, extending from the main highway to the northern and southern edges of the downtown area. The city population continued to multiply during the 20th century, booming through the 1970s as a popular retirement destination for Americans from [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] cities, reaching 238,647 in the 1980 census. Racial tensions persisted, and the city was rocked by the [[St. Petersburg, Florida riots of 1996|1996 riots]], sparked by the shooting of a black teenager by a white St. Pete police officer. Growth stagnated in the subsequent decade and a half, but since the [[Great Recession]], renewed interest in urban living by family aged residents and the expansion of the downtown university and related services has renewed its growth.{{fact|date=October 2024}}

St. Petersburg has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa'') with some characteristics of a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Am]]), with a defined rainy season from June through September. Many portions of St. Petersburg, especially along the bay and in south St. Petersburg, have tropical microclimates due to the maritime influence of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and [[Tampa Bay]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2022}} As a result, tropical flora like [[coconut palm]]s and [[royal palm]]s can be found throughout the city, and the city is home to the Gizella Kopsick Palm Arboretum, a {{convert|2|acre|adj=on}} park which houses over 500 palms and cycads,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.stpeteparksrec.org/gizella-kopsick-arboretum.html |title=Gizella Kopsick Palm Arboretum - St. Petersburg, Florida |access-date=January 6, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107022109/http://www.stpeteparksrec.org/gizella-kopsick-arboretum.html |archive-date=January 7, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> including a pair of large Jamaican Tall coconut palms which predate the freeze of 1989.
