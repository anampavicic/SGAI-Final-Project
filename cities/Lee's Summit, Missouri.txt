==History==
[[Image:LS Platt 1877.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Lee's Summit circa 1877. From the ''1877 Illustrated Historical Atlas of Jackson Co. Missouri'']]
The "Town of Strother" (not to be confused with a town of the [[Strother, Missouri|same name]] in [[Monroe County, Missouri|Monroe County]]) was founded by [[William Bullitt Howard]] in October 1865. He named it for his wife, Maria D. Strother, the daughter of William D. Strother formerly of [[Bardstown, Kentucky]]. Howard came to [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] in 1842 from [[Kentucky]], married Maria in 1844, and by 1850 he and Maria had {{convert|833|acre|km2}} and a homestead 5 miles (8 km) north of town. Howard was arrested for being a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] in October 1862, near the beginning of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and after being paroled he took his family back to [[Kentucky]] for the duration of the war. After the war ended he returned and, knowing that the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]] was surveying a route in the area, platted the town with {{convert|70|acre|m2}} in the fall of 1865 as the town of Strother.<ref name = "hist1"/><ref name = "hist3">{{Cite web

When the [[Surveying|surveyors]] for the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]] came through, the local people and the railroad wanted to name the town in Dr. Lea's honor. He had a farm on the highest point and near the path of the tracks, and his murder had taken place near the site of the proposed depot. So they chose the name of "Lea's Summit", the "summit" portion to reflect its highest elevation on the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]] between [[St. Louis]] and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]].<ref name= "hist2"/> But they misspelled the name "Lees Summit" (with two "e's"; "Lee" instead of "Lea"; and leaving out the apostrophe) on a [[boxcar]] that was serving as a [[Train station|station]] and donated by the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad|Missouri Pacific]], then a sign next to the tracks, and finally in the printed time schedule for the railroad.<ref name = "hist1" /><ref name = "hist3" /> It may be that this misspelling stuck and the name has remained "Lee's Summit" ever since.

Since the name was already being circulated and published with two "e's", the town petitioned the [[Missouri General Assembly|state legislature]] and incorporated its name in 1868 as: "Town of Lee's Summit".<ref name = "hist2"/>

The spelling is unusual because apostrophes are typically not included in place names due to potential confusion regarding whether the place is owned by the namesake person. Most possessive place names lack an apostrophe, such as [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia]].

The growth of the town can be studied through historic [[Sanborn maps]], which document building types and uses in the city during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<ref>{{cite web |date=March 3, 2023 |title=Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps of Missouri Collection |url=http://mulibraries.missouri.edu/specialcollections/sanborn.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040328220745/http://mulibraries.missouri.edu/specialcollections/sanborn.htm |archive-date=March 28, 2004 |website=MU Special Collections}}</ref>{{Importance inline|date=October 2023}}

In 1913, R. A. Long, the owner of a [[lumber]] company, began building his estate, named [[Longview Farm]], on the western edge of the city and into part of [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]].<ref name = "hist1" /> When complete, it had a mansion, five barns and 42 buildings in the {{convert|1700|acre|km2}}. Harrison Metheny, grandfather of jazz legend [[Pat Metheny]], was an electrician during the construction of Longview Farm.{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}} The farm also had a church, Longview Chapel Christian Church, which was completed in 1915. It soon became internationally known as a showplace farm. Today, one of the horse barns is home to [https://lfe.lsr7.org/ Longview Farm Elementary]. The church and mansion are on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Other parts of the farm have been turned into [[Longview Lake]], [[Metropolitan Community College (Missouri)|Longview Community College]], and a development called New Longview.<ref name = "hist1" /><ref name = "hist2"/> Lee's Summit is also home to [[Missouri Town 1855]] and [[Lee's Summit Historical Cemetery]].
