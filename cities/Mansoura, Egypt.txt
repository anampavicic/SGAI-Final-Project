The city is the capital of the [[Dakahlia Governorate]] and has a population of 621,953 as of 2021.<ref>{{cite web |title=citypopulation |url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Egypt-Cities.html |access-date=2017-10-03 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Mansoura'' in Arabic means "victorious". The city is named after the [[Battle of Mansurah (1250)|El Mansoura Battle]] (1250) against [[Louis IX of France]] during the [[Seventh Crusade]].

==History==
Mansoura was established in 1219 by [[al-Kamil]] of the [[Ayyubid]] dynasty upon a [[Phatmetic]] branch of [[Nile|the Nile]] on a place of several older villages like Al-Bishtamir ({{Langx|ar|البشطمير}}) and Kafr al-Badamas ({{Langx|ar|كفر البدماص}}, from {{Langx|grc|ποταμός}}, "river, canal").<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ramzi |first=Muhammad |title=Geographical dictionary of the Egyptian places from the ancient Egyptians dynasty to 1945 |year=1945}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Timm|first=Stefan|title=Das christlich-koptische Agypten in arabischer Zeit|year=2007|pages=366}}</ref> After the Egyptians defeated the [[Crusade]]rs during the [[Seventh Crusade]], it was named ''Mansoura'' (aka. "The Victorious").

In the [[Seventh Crusade]], the [[Capetian dynasty|Capetians]] were defeated and put to flight; between fifteen and thirty thousand of their men fell on the battlefield. [[Louis IX of France]] was captured in the main [[Battle of Fariskur (1250)|Battle of Fariskur]], and confined in the house of Ibrahim Ibn Lokman, secretary of the sultan, and under the guard of the eunuch Sobih. The king's brother was imprisoned in the same house. The sultan provided for their sustenance. The house of Ibrahim Ibn Lokman is now the only museum in Mansoura. It is open to the public and houses articles that used to belong to the French monarch, including his personal thirteenth century [[toilet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/makrisi.html|title=Al-Makrisi: Account of the Crusade of St. Louis|access-date=6 February 2018}}</ref>

[[Israeli Air Force]] fighters attacking Egyptian air bases were intercepted by the [[Egyptian Air Force]]. On that day, 160 jet fighters, most belonging to Israel, battled for 53 minutes over Mansoura. The Egyptian army claimed that despite the numerical and qualitative superiority of the Israeli warplanes, 17 Israeli planes were downed. (2 according to the Israelis), while the rest retreated.<ref>[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/868/sk1.htm Al-Ahram weekly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519044831/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/868/sk1.htm |date=2009-05-19 }}</ref><ref>[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1998/399/eg11.htm Al-Ahrm weekly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913084649/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1998/399/eg11.htm |date=2009-09-13 }}</ref><ref>{{in lang|he}} [https://www.calcalist.co.il/internet/articles/0,7340,L-3851076,00.html Calcalist]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201006123625/https://www.calcalist.co.il/internet/articles/0,7340,L-3851076,00.html}}</ref> Egypt announced the loss of six planes, only three of which fell to Israeli fire.

==Culture==
[[File:MansuraShenawi.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the Shinnawi Palace]]
[[File:Folktheat.webm|thumb|250px|Folklore show in Mansoura]]
The [[Egyptian Arabic]] dialect spoken by Mansoura's population is a northern Egyptian Arabic dialect, with noticeable influences from the city's surrounding rural villages, each of which has contributed to the city's population over the years. There are some similarities to [[Alexandria]]n [[Egyptian Arabic]] in some aspects of pronunciation.

Mansoura National Museum used to be Dar Ibn Lockman, the house where [[Louis IX]] was imprisoned in 1250 during the [[Seventh Crusade]]. Displayed in the museum are the suits of mail and swords of the crusaders, as well as a collection of maps. Huge paintings depict the Battle of Mansoura.

The Mansoura branch of the National Library was inaugurated in 2008 as the Mansoura Misr Library.<ref>[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/912/fe1.htm Mansura public library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017154840/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/912/fe1.htm |date=2008-10-17 }}</ref>

Mansoura is famous for its architectural style, especially the Shinnawi Palace (after Mohamed Bek El-Shinnawi, a member of the [[Wafd Party]]). It was built by an [[Italians|Italian]] architect in 1928. The mosque of El-Saleh Ayoub El-Kebir is one of the most important in Mansoura. It was built by a loyal servant of the Sultan and is located in Al-Sagha Street that separates "Old Mansoura" from the modern city.<ref name="Mansoura">[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1999/430/tr2.htm Mansoura] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520023315/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1999/430/tr2.htm |date=2008-05-20 }}</ref> 

Like [[Cairo]], [[Alexandria]] and [[Port Said]], Mansoura was home to a flourishing [[Egyptian Greeks|Greek]] community until the [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] era, when many were [[20th century departures of foreign nationals from Egypt|forced to leave]]. Many of the older and best established shops and businesses around the city still bear their original [[Greeks|Greek]] names. Mansoura also had a small Italian population living in the city too. The first Old English school in the city was established on the site of the old [[Greeks|Greek]] school in the Toriel area, one of the traditionally relatively affluent residential districts of the city.

==Education==
[[Image:Mansoura University.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[University of Mansoura]]]]
The [[University of Mansoura]] was founded in 1962, initially as a branch of [[Cairo University]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://home.mans.eun.eg/ |title=Mansourah University official website |access-date=2008-10-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924182947/http://home.mans.eun.eg/ |archive-date=2008-09-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[Urology]] and [[Nephrology]] center of [[Mansoura University]] founded by Prof [[Mohammed Ghonem]] is considered to be the best kidney center in the Middle East and Africa.<ref name="Mansoura"/>

Mansoura has a sports [[stadium]] ([[El Mansoura Stadium|Mansoura Stadium]]) which is home to its [[football (soccer)|football]] team.
