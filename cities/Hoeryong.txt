== History ==
Hoeryŏng was one of the six posts/garrisons ([[Hangul|Chosŏngŭl]]: 육진,  [[Hanja]]: 六鎭) established under the order of [[Sejong the Great of Joseon]] (1418 - 1450) to safeguard his people from the potentially hostile semi-nomadic [[Jurchens]] living north of the Yalu river.
In 1952, some territories of Hoeryŏng (then a county), which included [[Myeon (administrative division)|myoen]] of Poŭl and parts of myoens of  Yonghung and Pyŏksŏng, were incorporated into the then newly created Yusŏn county.<ref name="encyy">{{cite web|url=https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/CategoryNavi?category=field&keyword=%EC%A0%95%EC%B9%98%C2%B7%EB%B2%95%EC%A0%9C/%EB%B6%81%ED%95%9C&ridx=1031&tot=1041|title=회령시|trans-title=Hoeryong city|language=ko|publisher=[[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]]|access-date=2021-02-02}}</ref> After the 1974 incorporation of Yusŏn county, the Yusŏn region became a up and was renamed as Yusŏn worker's region.<ref name="encyy"/>
In early May 2007, the newly appointed [[Premier of North Korea|Prime Minister]] [[Kim Yong-il]] visited Hoeryŏng. At the time, the Prime Minister brought with him on his train one carriage worth of glass (made in South Korea) and 3 carriages worth of cement. After delivering the goods to the People's Committee of Hoeryŏng he ordered that the city of Hoeryŏng be decorated and adorned as much as a city where Mother Kim Jong Suk's birthplace should be.

==Administrative divisions==
Hoeryŏng-si is divided into 19 ''[[Administrative divisions of North Korea|tong]]'' (neighbourhoods) and 28 ''[[Administrative divisions of North Korea|ri]]'' (villages):

==Economy==
Hoeryŏng's main industries are mining machines and a paper mill. The area contains many [[Mining|mines]]. According to media reports, in 2017 ordinary residents in Hoeryong receive electricity for 3–4 hours per day.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=[[UPI]] |quote=Ordinary North Koreans in Hoeryong, North Hamgyong Province, on the other hand, are supplied with electricity for about 3 to 4 hours a day, the North Korean source said. |title=North Korea supplies high-voltage electricity to border fence |first=Elizabeth |last=Shim |date=July 12, 2017 |url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2017/07/12/North-Korea-supplies-high-voltage-electricity-to-border-fence/3871499865995/?nll=1}}</ref> However, many people do not have electricity at all.

==Civil unrest==
It is reported that on 24 September 2008 only about 20% of Hoeryŏng's city residents attended a civilian defence-training programme held in Hoeryŏng City. The other 80% are thought to have stayed home or tended to private patch fields. As punishment, authorities from the Civilian Defence ordered non-attendees to pay KP₩5,000, however this fine was largely ignored.<ref>''North Korea Today'', No. 28. (2008). Research Institute for North Korean society.</ref>

==2016 Flood==

On 29 August 2016, as the result of [[Typhoon Lionrock (2016)|Typhoon Lionrock]], the Tumen River flooded, making many of the residents homeless and causing substantial property damage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://beyondparallel.csis.org/implications-north-korean-flood/|title=Implications of North Korean Flood|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|date=2 November 2016|access-date=24 July 2020}}</ref> The displaced residents moved to China.

==Climate==
