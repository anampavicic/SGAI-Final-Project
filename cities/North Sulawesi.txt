'''North Sulawesi''' ({{langx|id|Sulawesi Utara}}) is a [[Provinces of Indonesia|province of Indonesia]].  It is mainly located on the [[Minahasa Peninsula]] of the island of [[Sulawesi]], south of the [[Philippines]] and southeast of [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]], but also includes various small archipelagoes situated between the Minahasa Peninsula and southern Philippines. It borders the Philippines province of [[Davao Occidental]] and [[Soccsksargen|Soccsksargen regions]] to the north, the [[Maluku Sea]] to the east, [[Gorontalo]] (its sole land border) and the [[Celebes Sea]] to the west and the [[Gulf of Tomini]] to the southwest. The province's furthest extent, the outlying and isolated island of [[Miangas]] to its north, is the northernmost island of Indonesia as a bordering with the [[Philippines]]. 

The province's area is {{convert|14500.28|km2}}, and its population was 2,270,596 according to the 2010 census;<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> this rose to 2,621,923 at the 2020 Census,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> while the official estimate as at mid-2023 was 2,681,540 (comprising 1,369,850 males and 1,311,690 females).<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Provinsi Sulawesi Utara Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.71)</ref>

The province's capital and largest city is [[Manado]], which is also the main gateway and the economic center of the province. Other major towns includes [[Tomohon]] and [[Bitung]] in the northern (Minahasa) half of the province, and [[Kotamobagu]] in the southern (Bolaang Mongondow) half. There are 41 mountains with an altitude ranging from {{convert|1112|-|1995|m}}. Most geologic conditions in the province are consisted mainly of young volcanic regions, with numerous eruptions and many active volcanic cones that adorn the central Minahasa, Bolaang Mongondow and [[Sangihe Islands]].

North Sulawesi in the past was an area of potential spices, rice and gold which became a battleground for the interests of economic hegemony between the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and the Kingdoms around this area, which ultimately led to political and military struggles. The past of this region also became the trading route between west and east and the spread of Christianity, Islam and belief or religion brought by Chinese merchants. The Portuguese first landed on the area at the 16th century. Following decades of war between the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] to control the area, the area ultimately fell to the Dutch at the 17th century. The Dutch ruled the area for three centuries, before being ousted by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] on the eve of [[World War II]]. Following the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] in 1945, the Dutch briefly regained possession of the area, before finally leaving in 1949 following the [[Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference|Round Table Conference]], in which the Dutch recognized the newly created [[United States of Indonesia]] (RIS). Thus, North Sulawesi was incorporated into the territory of the [[State of East Indonesia]] (NIT). The NIT was finally dissolved and then merged into the RIS. 

On 17 August 1950, the RIS was officially disbanded and then re-formed as the unitary state of the Republic of Indonesia. The island of Sulawesi was governed briefly as a single province, before being separated into several different provinces. Thus, the province of North Sulawesi was created on 14 August 1959. The western half of this area (as that time comprising the [[Gorontalo Regency]] and the newly created [[Boalemo Regency]]) was separated from North Sulawesi on 5 December 2000 and established as the province of [[Gorontalo]].

==Etymology==
The area around North Sulawesi used to be called '''Minahasa'''. The name is still used sometimes to refer to the province. The word Minahasa is etymologically derived from the words ''Mina-Esa'' (Minaesa) or ''Maesa'' which means 'being one' or 'uniting', meaning hope to unite various sub-ethnic groups of Minahasa consisting of Tontemboan, Tombulu, Tonsea, Tolour (Tondano), Tonsawang, Ponosakan, Pasan and Bantik. The word "Minahasa" itself was only used during the colonial era. "Minahasa" is generally interpreted as "having become one". Based on several historical documents, the word "Minahasa" is firstly used by J.D. Schierstein, the Dutch regent of Manado, in his report to the Governor of Maluku on 8 October 1789. The word "Minahasa" in his report is defined as Landraad or "State Council" or "Regional Council".

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2024}}
===Pre-Colonial Era===
Archaeological research has revealed signs of human life in North Sulawesi from 30,000 years ago, based on evidence in the cave Liang Sarru on the island of Salibabu. Other evidence shows life about 6,000 years ago on the Passo Hillside Site in Kakas District and 4,000 years ago to early AD at the Liang Tuo Mane'e cave in Arangkaa on [[Karakelong]] Island.

===Colonial Period===
At the end of the 16th century, the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] arrived in North Sulawesi. When Europeans arrived, the [[Sultanate of Ternate|Ternate Sultanate]] had influence in North Sulawesi, frequented by Bugis traders from South Sulawesi. The wealth of Minahasa's natural resources made Manado a strategic port for European traders going to and from [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]]. The Portuguese were the first European colonizers to arrive in North Sulawesi, a Portuguese ship anchored on an island off Manado in the Kingdom of Manado in 1521. The northern islands of the peninsula were under the control of the [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]] during the time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://nhcp.gov.ph/?option=com_content&task=view&id=574 | title=National Historical Commission of the Philippines }}</ref> The Spanish ship docked on the island of [[Talaud Islands|Talaud]] and [[Siau Island|Siau]], on to [[Ternate]]. The Portuguese built a fort at Amurang. Spain built a Fort in Manado, giving Spain control of the [[Minahasa Peninsula]]. Resistance against Spanish occupation culminated in 1660–1664. Dutch ships landed in Manado City in 1660, assisting the Minahasa Confederation against Spain. The members of the Minahasa Confederation entered into a Trade Agreement with the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]]. This trade cooperation agreement gave the VOC monopoly on trade, gradually imposing its will, eventually leading to the 1700s resistance in Ratahan, culminating in the Dutch Minahasa-War in 1809–1811 at [[Tondano]].

Spain had colonized [[Captaincy General of the Philippines|the Philippines]] and made  Minahasa a coffee plantation with imported South American coffee because of its fertile land. Manado was further developed by Spain to become a center of coffee trade for Chinese merchants. In the 16th century one of the first Indo-Eurasian communities in the archipelago appeared in Manado. The first king of Manado, Muntu Untu (1630) was half Spanish. Spain then handed over Minahasa to the Portuguese in exchange for 350,000 ducats in a treaty. The rulers of Minahasa sent Supit, Pa'at, and Lontoh to ally with the Dutch to expel the Portuguese from Minahasa. In 1655 they excelled, building their own fortress in 1658 and drove out the last Portuguese a few years later.{{when|date=February 2023}}

By the beginning of the 17th century the Dutch had overthrown the sultanate of Ternate, and began to gain influence from Spain and Portugal. In 1677 the Dutch conquered the [[Sangir Archipelago|Sangir archipelago]], two years later, [[Robert Padtbrugge]], the governor of Maluku, visited Manado. His arrival resulted in an agreement with the Minahasan chiefs who led to Dutch domination for the next 300 years although the direct rule by the Dutch only began in 1870. The Dutch helped unify the Minahasa confederation, and in 1693. Dutch influence flourished with the spreading of Christianity and European culture in the land of Minahasa. The missionary schools in Manado in 1881 were one of the first attempts of mass education in Indonesia, providing an opportunity for graduates to find employment in the civil service, military, and high positions in the [[Dutch East Indies]] government. Minahasa relations with the Dutch were often poor. Causing a war between the Dutch and Tondano in 1807 and 1809. Eventually the Dutch and Minahasa became very close, with Minahasa often referred to as the 12th Dutch province. In 1947, some Manadonese formed a political movement of Twapro, short for Twaalfde Provincie (Twelfth Province) who appealed for formal integration of Minahasa into the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]].

===Independence===
[[File:Wilayah Sulawesi Utara (1960-2000).gif|thumb|Reduction of North Sulawesi territories from 1960 until 2000.]]
During [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies]] the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] bombed Manado greatly in 1945. During the [[Indonesian War of Independence]], there was a split between pro-Indonesian and pro-Dutch residents. The appointment of [[Sam Ratulangi]] as the first governor of Sulawesi then succeeded in winning Minahasan support to the Republic of Indonesia. After Indonesian independence, Indonesia was divided into 8 provinces, and Sulawesi was one of these provinces. In 1946 the [[State of East Indonesia]] was formed in Sulawesi, and later became a state within the [[United States of Indonesia]]. The State of East Indonesia was dissolved, and merged into the Republic of Indonesia as part of a then unified Sulawesi Province.

In March 1957, Sulawesi military leaders held a confrontation with the central government, with demands for greater regional autonomy. They called for more active development, a fairer distribution of taxes, assistance against [[Abdul Kahar Muzakkar]]'s rebellion in [[South Sulawesi]], and a central government cabinet headed by [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta]] in balance. At first the movement of the '[[Permesta]]' (Charter of the Struggle of the Universe) was merely a movement of reform rather than a separatist movement.

Negotiations between the central government and Sulawesi military leaders prevented violence in South Sulawesi, but Minahasan leaders were not satisfied with the outcome of the agreement and the movement broke out. Fearful of southern dominance, Minahasan leaders declared their own North Sulawesi autonomous state in June 1957. At that time the central government had controlled South Sulawesi, but in the North there were no strong figures of the central government and there were rumors that [[the United States]] was arming the [[Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia|PRRI]] rebellion in Sumatra, which has links with Minahasan leaders.

The possibility of foreign intervention prompted the central government to request military assistance from southern Sulawesi. The Permesta forces were later removed from [[Central Sulawesi]], [[Gorontalo]], [[Sangihe Islands]], and [[Morotai]] in [[Moluccas]]. The United States then halted resistance, and in June 1958 central government forces landed in Minahasa. The Permesta uprising ended in mid-1961.

The effects of the Sumatra and Sulawesi rebellions  was ultimately counterproductive, with central government authority increasing while regional autonomy weakened, radical nationalism strengthened than pragmatic moderation, communist party power and Sukarno increased while Mohammad Hatta was weakened, with the establishing of [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia|Guided Democracy]] ({{langx|id|Demokrasi Terpimpin}}) in 1958. But the demands of the Minahasa peoples for the province of their own would not end, and in 1964 the [[People's Representative Council]] enacted Law no. 13 officially creating the province of North Sulawesi, with Manado as provincial seat. 14 August 1959 was designated as the anniversary of the province.

Since the [[May 1998 riots of Indonesia|1998 reforms]], the Indonesian government has begun to adopt laws that enhanced regional autonomy. Two years later, the city of Gorontalo and two Muslim-majority regencies of the province were separated to form Gorontalo Province.

The slowest growing regency was that of the [[Sangihe Islands]]. In 2010, about 68% were Christian (predominantly [[Protestant]] with a sizable [[Catholic]] minority), one of the few exceptions in the predominantly Muslim Indonesia, due to the prominent Dutch missionary activity during the colonial era.  Also, because the Muslim-majority region of Gorontalo (then comprising a city and two regencies) was split off to form [[Gorontalo (province)|a new province]] on 5 December 2000. There are also [[Muslim]], [[Hinduism|Hindu]], and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] minorities. The largest ethnic groups are the [[Minahasa]]n in the north of the province and the Mongondow to the south.  The province's chief city is [[Manado]] with a population of 458,580 people according to the mid 2023 official estimate.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Provinsi Sulawesi Utara Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.71)</ref>

About two-thirds of the population of North Sulawesi adhere to [[Christianity]], while nearly one-third follow [[Islam]]; smaller numbers follow [[Hinduism]] or other faiths. Christianity is the predominant religion in those districts and cities of the Islands and Minahasa, while Islam is the largest religion in the districts and cities in the Bolaang Mongondow. Most of the Christians in North Sulawesi adhere to [[Protestantism]], while significant minority [[Roman Catholic]] communities also exist in Manado and Bitung. Chinese folk religions such as [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] also exist, mostly concentrated in Manado, which has a significant Chinese population. Manado also has a [[Judaism|Jewish]] community, numbering about 800. Currently, the only synagogue in Indonesia is located in Manado. As the Indonesian government only recognizes six religions and traditional faith, those who adhere to other religions or faiths can choose to put one of the officially recognized religions or traditional faith, or ''Kepercayaan Terhadap Tuhan Yang Maha Esa'' (Believe in One Almighty God) on their ID cards.

===Ethnicity===
[[File:Chinese Temple Manado.jpg|thumb|Chinese Temple located near Manado]]
The [[Minahasa people|Minahasan]] is the dominant ethnic group in the province. They are the most populous ethnic group in the [[Minahasa Peninsula]]. They mostly lived in areas covering [[Bitung]] City, [[Manado]] City, [[Tomohon]] City, [[Minahasa Regency]], [[North Minahasa Regency]], [[South Minahasa Regency]] and [[Southeast Minahasa Regency]]. Other ethnic groups are the Bolaang Mongondow, Sangihe, Talaud and Siau. Ethnicity in North Sulawesi is more heterogeneous then other parts of Indonesia. The Minahasan and Bolaang Mongondow are spread almost throughout the region of North Sulawesi mainland. The Sangihe, Talaud and Siau mostly inhabit the Sangihe Islands, Talaud Island, and Lembeh Island, especially in coastal areas north, east and west of mainland North Sulawesi. The [[Bajau people]] are seafaring nomads who has migrated from the [[Sulu Archipelago]] in the [[Philippines]], due to the [[Moro conflict in the Philippines|conflict in Mindanao]]. They inhabits several coastal villages of North Sulawesi in the northern part of North Minahasa Regency.

In addition to the natives, North Sulawesi is also home to migrants. There are a significant [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]] population in North Sulawesi, especially around the city of Manado. The Chinese are also one of the first people to have contact with the local people before the Europeans came. According to the discovery of Chinese ancient letters in the Tompaso area, Minahasa shows the cultural interaction between the Chinese and Minahasa have existed since the [[Han dynasty]]. Most of the Chinese population in North Sulawesi are from the [[Hakka people|Hakka]] dialect group, while small numbers of [[Hoklo people|Hokkien]] and [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] populations also exist.

Other ethnic groups such as the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and the [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] also exist. They are mostly migrated from where they come from due to the [[Transmigration program]] enacted by the Dutch during the colonial era until the Suharto era. They generally live in urban areas, such as Manado and Bitung.

===Language===
[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] is the official language of the province, as well as of other parts of Indonesia. Official documents released by the provincial government as well as road signs are all written in Indonesian. However, [[Manado Malay]] is the [[lingua franca]] of the province. This language resembles Indonesian but with a distinct accent and dialect. Some of the vocabulary are derived from Dutch, Portuguese and other foreign languages. Manado Malay is often used for day-to-day communication between different ethnic groups. [[Minahasan languages]] are spoken by the Minahasan people. They are spread around the central and northern part of the province. In the Minahasa area, five (5) distinct languages are spoken: [[Tonsawang language|Tonsawang]], [[Tontemboan language|Tontemboan]], [[Tondano language|Toulour]], [[Tonsea language|Tonsea]] and [[Tombulu language|Tombulu]]. To the south, the [[Mongondow language]] and the [[Gorontalo language]] are spoken. In the islands to the north which borders the Philippines, the [[Visayan languages]] are used by the local people.

Other languages spoken are [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] and [[Balinese language|Balinese]]. They are mostly spoken by migrants coming from other parts of Indonesia. As Manado has a significant Chinese population, [[Hakka language|Hakka]] is also spoken by some Chinese people. Some other [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese dialects]] are also spoken, such as [[Hokkien]] and [[Cantonese]]. English and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] are widely understood in areas where there is a large tourism industry, such as the Bunaken National Park. Older generations tend to understand [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. People who lived in islands near the borders of the Philippines may understand [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].

==Government and administrative divisions==
{{See also|List of Governors of North Sulawesi}}

Following the separation of [[Central Sulawesi]] as a separate province in 1964, North Sulawesi was composed of four regencies ({{langx|id|kabupaten}}) - Minahasa, Sangihe Islands, Bolaang Mongondow and Gorontalo - and the independent city ({{langx|id|kotamadya}}) of '''Manado'''. The city of '''Bitung''' was separated from Minahasa Regency on 15 August 1990 to become a second independent city. On 4 October 1999 a new Boalemo Regency was created from part of Gorontalo Regency, but on 5 December 2000 both Gorontalo Regency and the new Boalemo Regency were split off from the province to become jointly a new [[Gorontalo Province]]. Further regencies were created from 2002 onwards - '''Talaud Islands''' on 10 April 2002 from part of Sangihe Islands Regency, '''North Minahasa''' on 18 December 2002 from part of Minahasa Regency, and '''South Minahasa''' - and the independent city of '''Tomohon''' - on 25 February 2003 from further parts of Minahasa Regency. Further new regencies followed on 2 January 2007 - '''North Bolaang Mongondow''' and the independent city of '''Kotamobagu''' from parts of Bolaang Mongondow Regency, the '''Sitaro Islands''' from part of Sangihe Islands Regency, and '''Southeast Minahasa''' from part of South Minahasa Regency. Two further regencies were created on 24 June 2008 from further parts of Bolaang Mongondow Regency - '''East Bolaang Mongondow''' and '''South Bolaang Mongondow'''.

The province is thus now divided into eleven regencies ({{langx|id|kabupaten}}) and four independent cities ({{langx|id|kotamadya}}), listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 2020 Census,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> together with the official estimates as at mid 2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Provinsi Sulawesi Utara Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.71)</ref>

Proposals have been under consideration since 2013 by the People's Representative Council (''Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat'' or DPR) to create a separate '''Bolaang Mongondow Province'''. However, since 2013 the Indonesian Government have maintained a moratorium on the intended creation of new provinces, regencies and cities.

The province now forms one of Indonesia's 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the [[Indonesian Parliament|People's Representative Council]]. The '''North Sulawesi Electoral District''' consists of all of the 11 regencies and 4 cities in the province, and elects 6 members to the People's Representative Council.<ref>Law No. 7/2017 (''UU No. 7 Tahun 2017'') as amended by Government Regulation in Lieu of Law No. 1/2022 and Regulation of General Elections Commission No. 6/2023.</ref>
