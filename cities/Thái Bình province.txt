==People and culture==
[[File:Province de Thai-Binh (1909).jpg|thumb|left|Map of Thai Binh province in 1909]]
Although situated in the centre of the [[Red River Delta]], in the past, Thái Bình was considered an island bounded by three larger rivers, and is the only province never to have been merged or separated. This position gives the people of Thái Bình a quite distinct culture. Thái Bình is the homeland of ''[[hát chèo]]'' opera (in [[Khuốc]] village, [[Phong Châu]] commune, [[Đông Hưng District]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thaibinhtrade.gov.vn/default.aspx?ID=70&LangID=2 |title=Culture-Religion |publisher=Thaibinhtrade.gov.vn |access-date=2010-06-15 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhandan.com.vn/tinbai/?article=106337&sub=81&top=43 |title=Trang tin bài |publisher=Nhan Dan |date=2007-09-29 |access-date=2010-06-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614031406/http://www.nhandan.com.vn/tinbai/?article=106337&sub=81&top=43 |archive-date=June 14, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Thứ 4&nbsp;ngày 16 tháng 06 năm 2010 |url=http://www.thaibinh.gov.vn/end-user/index.asp?website_id=39&menu_id=624&parent_menu_id=624&article_id=2392&fuseaction=DISPLAY_SINGLE_ARTICLE |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120805224948/http://www.thaibinh.gov.vn/end-user/index.asp?website_id=39&menu_id=624&parent_menu_id=624&article_id=2392&fuseaction=DISPLAY_SINGLE_ARTICLE |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-08-05 |title=Chao mung cac ban den voi Website UBND Tinh Thai Binh |publisher=Thaibinh.gov.vn |access-date=2010-06-15}}</ref>) and [[water puppetry]] (in [[Nguyên Xá]] commune, [[Đông Hưng District]]).<ref>{{cite web|author=Librios Semantic Environment |url=http://www.culturalprofiles.net/Viet_Nam/Directories/Vi_ACYAIw-7879_ADs-t_Nam_Cultural_Profile/-3643.html |title=Việt Nam: Puppetry |publisher=Culturalprofiles.net |date=2006-08-02 |access-date=2010-06-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/summary_0199-845417_ITM |title=Words on a wire: a water puppet troupe in northern Vietnam has survived nasty spells of cold weather, intense local competition and even war.

Thái Bình is the homeland of the most prolific and famous Vietnamese savant in the Middle Ages: [[Lê Quý Đôn]]. [[Trần Thủ Độ]], the founder of the [[Trần dynasty]], was born in [[Hưng Hà District]]. [[Bùi Viện]], the founder of [[Haiphong]] city, was a famous reformer in the 19th century. He was the first Vietnamese known to have visited the United States and also served as ambassador to the United States under the [[Nguyễn dynasty]].

The first Vietnamese to travel into [[outer space]] was the [[cosmonaut]] [[Phạm Tuân]], a native of Thái Bình. Two other natives of Thái Bình are the ones who finalized the two famous wars in Vietnam: [[Tạ Quốc Luật]], who captured [[Christian de Castries]] and raised the victory flag in the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] (the [[First Indochina War]]) and [[Bùi Quang Thận]], who led a group of Northern tanks and entered the headquarters of South Vietnam's government to make president [[Dương Văn Minh]] unconditionally surrender (the [[Vietnam War|second Indochina War]]). The Thái Bình born, first Chief of General Staff was [[Hoàng Văn Thái]]. Thái Bình is also the homeland of several famous Vietnamese political dissidents and humanitarians. [[Thích Quảng Độ]] is a Vietnamese Buddhist leader and critic of the Vietnamese government. In 2006, he was awarded the [[Thorolf Rafto Memorial Prize]], and was also a nominee for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. [[Dương Thu Hương]], arguably the most famous postwar Vietnamese writer, whose novel ''[[Paradise of the Blind]]'' (Những thiên đường mù, 1988) became the first Vietnamese novel ever published in the United States in English,<ref>[http://www.utdallas.edu/research/cts/Publications/Annotated%20books%20received/6-1/6-1vietnamese.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050113050530/http://www.utdallas.edu/research/cts/Publications/Annotated%20books%20received/6-1/6-1vietnamese.htm|date=January 13, 2005}}</ref> is also a famous political dissident. [[Nguyễn Hữu Đang]], born in [[Kiến Xương District]], was the leader and prominent victim of the [[Nhân Văn affair]] – a movement for a movement for political and cultural freedom of Vietnamese intellectuals. This affair is one of the most tragic events in modern Vietnamese history.

Some Thái Bình people are among the richest in Vietnam, including [[Vũ Quang Hội]] who is the founder of [[Bitexco]] group (who owns [[Bitexco Financial Tower]] in [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[The Manor (Hanoi)|The Manor]] luxury building in [[Hanoi]], etc.), [[Vu Van Tien]], founder of [[Geleximco]] – the largest private company in [[Hanoi]] and [[AB Bank]], a large private bank. [[Quách Tuấn Ngọc]], a native of [[Đông Hưng District|Đông Hưng]], while a professor of [[computer science]] in [[Hanoi University of Technology]], authored the first successfully commercial domestic software: [[BKED]] (''Bach khoa Editor'') – a system for processing Vietnamese text, in the 1980s.

==Etymology==
The province's name derives from [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] [[wikt:太|太]][[wikt:平|平]] meaning "great peace".

==Geography==
The province includes the [[Tien Hai Nature Reserve]], which is part of the [[Red River Delta Biosphere Reserve]]. Much of this is being considered for development.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.mongabay.com/2023/09/tien-hai-nature-reserve-latest-battleground-in-vietnams-push-for-development/ |title=Tien Hai Nature Reserve latest battleground in Vietnam’s push for development |author=Michael Tatarski |work=Mongabay |date=22 September 2023 |access-date=2 October 2023}}</ref>
