'''El Monte''' is a city in [[Los Angeles County, California]], United States. The city lies in the [[San Gabriel Valley]], east of the city of [[Los Angeles]].

El Monte's slogan is "Welcome to Friendly El Monte" and is historically known as "'''The End of the Santa Fe Trail'''". As of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], the city had a total population of 109,450, down from 113,475 at the [[2010 United States census|2010 census]]. As of 2020, El Monte was the [[List of largest cities in California by population|66th-most populous city in California]].

==Origin of name==
El Monte is situated between the San Gabriel and Rio Hondo Rivers; a marshy area roughly where the [[Santa Fe Dam Recreation Area]] is now located. Residents claimed that anything could be grown in the area. Between 1770 and 1830, Spanish soldiers and missionaries often stopped here for respite. They called the area 'El Monte,' which in Spanish means  'the mountain' or 'the mount'.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt. Print. Off. | author=Gannett, Henry | year=1905 | page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ/page/n117 118]}}</ref>  Most people assume the name refers to a mountain, but there were no mountains in the valley.  The word is an archaic Spanish translation of that era, meaning "the wood".  The first explorers had found this a rich, low-altitude land blanketed with thick growths of wispy willows, alders, and cattails, located between the two rivers. Wild grapevines and watercress also abounded.  El Monte is approximately 7 miles long and 4 miles wide.<ref name="earthlink1">{{cite web |url=http://home.earthlink.net/~jackbarton/ElMonteHistory.htm |title=A Brief History Of El Monte |publisher=Home.earthlink.net |access-date=August 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801231324/http://home.earthlink.net/~jackbarton/ElMonteHistory.htm |archive-date=August 1, 2010 }}</ref> When the State Legislature organized California into more manageable designated townships in the 1850s, they called it the El Monte Township.

==History==
===Pre-1800s===
[[File:Rancho La Puente.png|thumb|left|Modern-day El Monte sits on land that was originally part of [[Rancho La Puente]], a Mexican-era [[ranchos of California|rancho grant]].]]
[[File:Oldesthomein-El-Monte-1922.jpg|thumb|left|Oldest home in El Monte, built 1849 (photo 1922)]]

The area, beside the [[San Gabriel River (California)|San Gabriel River]], is part of the homeland of the [[Tongva people]] as it has been for thousands of years. The Spanish [[Portolá expedition]] of missionaries and soldiers passed through the area in 1769–1770.  [[Mission San Gabriel Arcángel]] was the center of colonial activities in the area.   The site was within the [[Ranchos of California|Mexican land grant]] [[Rancho La Puente]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gXO8DAEACAAJ&q=covina+images+of+america|title=El Monte|isbn=9781531628284 |last1=Barton |first1=Jorane King |date=October 18, 2006 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing Library Editions }}</ref>

===1800s===

The [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]] trade route was first established by [[Antonio Armijo]] in 1829. It passed through El Monte to its terminus at the Mission San Gabriel via what is now [[Valley Boulevard]].  The trade was woolen and other products from New Mexico for California horses and mules.

Using the Old Spanish Trail route at the end of 1841, a group of travelers and settlers, now referred to as the [[John A. Rowland#Workman-Rowland Party|Workman-Rowland Party]], arrived in the [[Pueblo of Los Angeles]] and this area in [[Alta California]] from [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México]].  Rowland and Workman became grantees of the Rancho La Puente in 1845.

The Old Spanish Trail from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] was continued east via the [[Santa Fe Trail]] trade route, established in 1821 as a trail and wagon road connecting [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] in [[Missouri Territory]] to Santa Fe, still within México.<ref name="villageprofile.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.villageprofile.com/california/elmonte/02/topic.html |title=El Monte CA &#124; History - Presented by Village Profile |publisher=Villageprofile.com |access-date=August 3, 2010}}</ref>[[File:OldSpanishTrail.png|200px|right|thumb|The route of the Old Spanish Trail]]

From 1847, the Santa Fe Trail was also connected westward through the [[Southern Emigrant Trail]], and in 1848 by the [[Mormon Road]] from Utah, passing by the El Monte area, to the Pueblo of Los Angeles.  Immigrant settlement began in 1848, El Monte was a stopping place for the American immigrants going to the gold fields during the [[California Gold Rush]]. The first permanent residents arrived in El Monte around 1849-1850 mostly from [[Texas]], [[Arkansas]] and [[Missouri]], during a time when thousands migrated to California in search of gold. The first settlers with families were Nicholas Schmidt, Ira W. Thompson, G. and F. Cuddeback, J. Corbin, and J. Sheldon.

These migrants ventured upon the bounty of fruitful, rich land along the [[San Gabriel River (California)|San Gabriel River]] and began to build homesteads there. The farmers were very pleased at the increasing success of El Monte's agricultural community, and it steadily grew over the years.<ref name="villageprofile.com"/>

In the 1850s the settlement was briefly named Lexington by American settlers, but soon returned to being called El Monte or Monte. It was at the crossroad of routes between Los Angeles, [[San Bernardino]], and the natural harbor at [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]].  In the early days, it had a reputation as a rough town where men often settled disputes with knives and guns in its gambling saloons. Defense against Indian raids and the crimes of bandit gangs, such as that of [[Joaquin Murrieta]], led to the formation of a local militia company called the [[Monte Rangers]] in February 1854.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/MonteRangers.html |title=Monte Rangers |website=Militarymuseum.org |date=February 8, 2016 |access-date=June 6, 2017}}</ref> After the Monte Rangers disbanded, justice for [[Los Angeles County]], in the form of volunteer [[wikt:posse|posse]]s, as in the 1857 hunt for the bandit gang of [[Juan Flores (outlaw)|Juan Flores]] and [[Pancho Daniel]], or a [[lynching]], was often provided by the local vigilantes called the "El Monte Boys".

In 1858 the adobe Monte Station was established, a stagecoach stop on the [[Butterfield Overland Mail in California|Butterfield Overland Mail Section 2]] route.

By 1861 El Monte had become a sizeable settlement, and during the [[American Civil War]] was considered a Confederate stronghold sympathetic to the [[secession]] of Southern California from California to support the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref name="clendenen309">{{cite journal|last1=Clendenen|first1=Clarence C.|author-link=Clarence C.

However, the attempt failed when following the [[battle of Fort Sumter]], A. J. King marched through the streets with a portrait of the Confederate General [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] and was arrested by a [[U.S. Marshal]].  State arms sent from Governor [[John G. Downey]] for the unit were held up by Union officers at the port of [[San Pedro, Los Angeles, California|San Pedro]].  Union troops established [[New Camp Carleton]] near the town in March 1862 to suppress any rebellion, it was shut down three years later at the end of the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/CpCarlton.html |title=Historic California Posts: Camp Carleton (Camp Banning, Camp Prentis, New Camp Carleton) |website=Militarymuseum.org |date=February 8, 2016 |access-date=June 6, 2017}}</ref>

===1900s===
El Monte was incorporated as a municipality in 1912. During the 1930s, the city became a vital site for the [[New Deal]]'s federal Subsistence Homestead project, a [[Resettlement Administration]] program that helped grant single-family ranch houses to qualifying applicants. It became home to many 1930s white Americans from the [[Dust Bowl]] Migration.

Photographer [[Dorothea Lange]] took over a dozen photographs of the newly built Homestead homes for her work for the [[Farm Security Administration]] in Feb. 1936. Lange stopped in El Monte a month before she took her most well-known photograph from the period, the [[Migrant Mother]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Time|first=San Gabriel Valley in|title=Dorothea Lange Was in El Monte Before Taking "The Migrant Mother"|url=https://sgvintime.com/home/f/the-contrast-between-dorothea-langes-the-migrant-mother-and-p|access-date=September 22, 2021|website=San Gabriel Valley in Time|language=en-US}}</ref> "In contrast to the apparently positive scene in El Monte... in San Luis Obispo County, Lange captured a far gloomier scene of a Native-American mother with her children."

The area also experienced social and labor conflict during this period, such as the [[El Monte Berry Strike of 1933]], which shed light upon [[institutional racism]] experienced by Japanese tenant farmers and Latino farm laborers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tokunaga|first=Yu|date=April 3, 2020|title=Japanese Farmers, Mexican Workers, and the Making of Transpacific Borderlands|url=https://online.ucpress.edu/phr/article/89/2/165/107156/Japanese-Farmers-Mexican-Workers-and-the-Making-of|journal=Pacific Historical Review|language=en|volume=89|issue=2|pages=166–167|doi=10.1525/phr.2020.89.2.165|issn=0030-8684|doi-access=}}</ref>

===Modern===
The Asian population of El Monte had grew significantly between 1980 and 2008, and continued to grow.<ref name=":1" /> According to a former El Monte resident, this may have been because of overpopulation in [[Alhambra, California|Alhambra]], [[Monterey Park, California|Monterey Park]], and other nearby heavily Asian municipalities; causing people to move to less densely populated areas like El Monte, where the cities are still accessible by freeway.<ref name=":1">"[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2008/12/new-us-census-1.html Census snapshot: Asians find homes in historically Latino El Monte]" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20160117221623/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2008/12/new-us-census-1.html Archive]).

In the 1950s, as the unstable racial climate and the hostility toward rock & roll started to emerge, rock & roll shows were forced from the City of Los Angeles by police pressure. The [[El Monte Legion Stadium]], outside the city limits, became the site of a series for rock and roll concerts by [[Johnny Otis]] and other performers. (Johnny Otis along with [[Alan Freed]] and [[Dick Clark]] were the major powers in the growing rock and roll industry.)  During the fifties, teenagers from all over Southern California flocked to El Monte Legion Stadium every Friday and Saturday night to see their favorite performers.

A popular attraction from 1925 to 1942 was [[Gay's Lion Farm]]. Two European retired circus stars, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Gay, operated this tourist attraction, which has been called "the Disneyland of the 1920s and 1930s" by historian Jack Barton,<ref name="earthlink1" /> and many others of that era. The Gays raised wild animals for use in the motion picture industry and housed over 200 African lions.  Many of the lions starred in films during the 1920s and 1930s, including the [[Tarzan]] films starring [[Elmo Lincoln]] and [[Johnny Weissmuller]]. The [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] lion logo was made with two lions from the farm, "Slats" (1924–1927), and his lookalike successor "Jackie" (1928-1956).  Another one of the farm's famous lions was Numa, who appeared in several films throughout the 1920s, including Charlie Chaplin's "The Circus."<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1975|title=The 117th Conference & Equipment Exhibit: Century Plaza Hotel, Los Angeles September 28–October 3, 1975|journal=Journal of the SMPTE|volume=84|issue=8|pages=627–646|doi=10.5594/j13324|issn=0361-4573|doi-access=free}}</ref> In 1925, El Monte Union High School adopted "The Lions" name for its teams, and the Gays provided a lion mascot for big games.  The famous live lion farm was closed temporarily due to wartime meat shortages. It never reopened, but a life-sized memorial statue can be seen next to I-10 on the SE corner of [[Valley Boulevard]] and Peck Road. The original lion statue, commissioned for the Farm, stands in front of nearby [[El Monte High School]].<ref>John Garside & Marty Shields.
