'''Yongin''' ({{Korean|hangul=용인}}; {{IPA|ko|joŋ.in}}) is a city in the [[Seoul Capital Area]], the largest in [[Gyeonggi Province]], South Korea. With a population over 1 million, the city has developed rapidly since the 21st century, recording the highest population growth of any city in the country. Yongin is home to [[Everland]] and [[Caribbean Bay]], South Korea's most popular amusement and water parks. The city is also home to the [[Korean Folk Village]], the largest of its kind. Yongin is a multi-nuclear city with multiple urban centers, not a single nuclear structure, and Giheung District crosses the Yeongdong Expressway and Dongbaek, while Suji District crosses Pungdeokcheon Stream and Jukjeon.

Yongin is a city almost as large as [[Seoul]] by area, consisting of the highly urbanized districts of [[Suji District]] and [[Giheung District]] and the semi-urbanized district of [[Cheoin District]]. Yongin's urbanized districts are located close to the capital and many commute to and from [[downtown Seoul]] in approximately 30–40 minutes by car using the [[Gyeongbu Expressway]] or Yongin-Seoul Expressway, the [[Bundang Line]] subway, the [[Shinbundang Line]] subway or metropolitan buses. The [[Shinbundang Line]] with a maximum speed of {{convert|110|km/h|abbr=on}} extended to Suji District in January 2016, which allows Suji residents to travel to [[Gangnam Station]] in 25 minutes. The Bundang Line extended south to [[Giheung Station]] in December 2011, connecting to [[EverLine]] that extends all the way to Everland. In December 2013, the Bundang Line extended to [[Suwon Station]] of [[Seoul Subway Line 1]]. The 12,000-capacity [[Yongin Stadium]] and the 37,000-capacity [[Yongin Citizen Sports Park Stadium]] are the largest sports venues in Yongin. Both stadiums are used mostly for football matches.

==History==
Although there is evidence of human settlement here as far back as the fifth century, Yongin was granted city status only in March 1996.

==Geography==
Yongin has an inland location in the southern part of Gyeonggi province.

===Climate===
Yongin has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dwa'') due to its inland location. The average yearly temperature is 11.6&nbsp;°C, the average temperature in January is -3.1&nbsp;°C, the average temperature in August is 25.1&nbsp;°C, and the average yearly precipitation is 1,300mm.
