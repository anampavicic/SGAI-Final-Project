The town lies at an altitude of 125 meters from sea level. Its advantageous location, smooth and busy intercity connections and the fertile soil allowed Salihli to develop extremely well in the recent past.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.living-chiropractic.com.au/3-stretches-will-help-improve-sciatica/| title=Stretches to Reduce Sciatica }} Sunday, 15 January 2017</ref>

== History ==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Temple of Artemis, Salihli.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Temple of Artemis]] -->
Salihli is a city with a long history. [[fossil|Fossilised]] footprints discovered near the villages of [[Sindel, Salihli|Sindel]] and [[Çarıklar, Manisa]] are estimated to be between 10,000 and 26,000 years old, and are the first traces of [[prehistory]] in the region.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} However, the region came to foremost importance with the establishment of the city of [[Sardes]], which is located {{convert|7|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of Salihli center and where the most remarkable historical artifacts and remains of the region are found.

Sardes was the capital city of [[Lydia]] until 547 B.C., at which date it was captured by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] and governed by [[satrap]]s until 334 B.C.. After the Persians, the region was governed successively by the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)#Empire|Macedonian Empire]], the Kingdom of the [[Attalid dynasty|Attalids]], [[Roman Empire]] and [[Byzantine Empire]]. In the beginning of the 14th century, Turks under the [[Bey]]lik of [[Saruhan Principality|Saruhan]] captured the city and the region and ruled it for a century from their base in nearby [[Manisa]]. In 1400 the region passed over to the [[Ottoman Empire]] under which Manisa preserved its position as a primary regional center. In the beginning of the Ottoman rule, Salihli was a village of the [[Qadaa|kaza]] of [[Sart]], depending the province seat of [[Aydın]], situated more to the south, and was called {{Transl|ota|Evlâd-i Salih}} (meaning 'the children of Salih' in English). In the 19th century, with the construction of [[İzmir]]-[[Uşak]]-[[Afyonkarahisar|Afyon]] railway, Salihli demonstrated a much more rapid pace of progress compared to Sart and gained township status in 1872, when it became a [[Qadaa|kaza]] of the [[Sarukhanids|Sanjak of Saruhan]], centred around [[Manisa]]. From 1867 until 1922, Salihli was part of the [[Aidin Vilayet]] of the Ottoman Empire.

During the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]], the city was taken by Greek forces on 24 July 1920, then re-taken by the Turkish army on 5 September 1922. According to a number of sources, the retreating Greek army carried out a scorched-earth policy while fleeing from Anatolia during the final phase of the war.<ref name="Sydney Nettleton Fisher 1969, p. 386">[[Sydney Nettleton Fisher]], ''The Middle East: a history'', New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1969, p. 386</ref> According to James Loder Park, the U.S. Vice-Consul in Constantinople at the time, who toured much of the devastated area immediately after the Greek evacuation, 65% of Salihli had been destroyed.<ref name="U.S. Vice-Consul James Loder Park 1923">U.S. Vice-Consul James Loder Park ''to [[Secretary of State]], [[Smyrna]], 11 April 1923.'' US archives US767.68116/34</ref>

After the war, Salihli became one of the biggest and the most important districts of [[Manisa]].
It is not always easy to make estimates on Salihli's population before the establishment of the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] due to the lack of adequate sources. However, a population of 500 people was confirmed for Sart during the 1831 census. The city grew quite fast after the construction of the railway until the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. In the yearbook of 1891, 3000 people and in the yearbook of 1908, 4400 people were documented to be living in Salihli. In the first Republican census of 1927, 7191 people were recorded. The departure of the town's minority populations in 1923 also caused the population to decrease.

Salihli has always been an attractive destination for immigrants. In the Ottoman era, the region was a favorite stopover for [[nomad]] [[clan]]s ({{Lang|tr|aşiret}}). Today, it is still possible to trace the names of some of the region's villages to the original ''[[aşiret]]'' names such as [[Karayahşi]], [[Araplı]], [[Burhan]], [[Beylikli]], [[Çökelek]], [[Eldelek]], [[Dombaylı]], [[Durasıllı]], [[Sindel]] etc. Moreover, some {{Lang|tr|aşiret}} names refer to unsettled localities, such as [[Sığıralcısı]], [[Bayındırlı]], [[Karatekeli]], [[Kuşdoğanlı]], [[Kacar, Turkey|Kacar]], [[Taras, Turkey|Taras]], [[Karakeçili]]. After the 1890s until the 1950s, Salihli also attracted many immigrants moving into Turkey from the [[Balkans]], from [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Bulgaria]] particularly. Many [[Turkic languages|Turkic-speaking]] immigrants from [[Xinjiang]], [[China]] chose to live in Salihli during the Chinese revolutionary disturbances.

This part of the population, mainly [[Kazakhs]] and known as {{Lang|tr|Türkistanlılar}} in the city, came to Salihli between 1954 and 1955 in the following years. After the 1970s, some immigration from Eastern Anatolia also came to strengthen the ranks of the previous immigrants. Counter-movements in the population were towards Turkey's big cities and to [[Europe]], especially to [[Germany]] and [[France]]).

== Economy ==
The economy of the city is primarily based around agriculture, agricultural commerce and industry.

'''Agriculture:'''

The main agricultural products are seedless [[Sultana (grape)|sultana grapes]], [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[cotton]], [[tobacco]] and [[maize]]. The fertility of the region's soil also allows for the cultivation of a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. [[Cherries]] known as the Napoleon breed grown especially in the villages of [[Allahdiyen]] and [[Gökköy, Altıeylül|Gökköy]] and the potatoes locally known as {{Lang|tr|Bozdağ}} potatoes are particularly famous.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Stockbreeding is another source of income for rural inhabitants, of rising importance especially in the last decade.

'''Industry:'''

The recent building of Salihli Organized Industrial Zone (in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] {{Lang|tr|Salihli Organize Sanayi Bölgesi}}), extending over an area of 111 hectares in a triangular zone between the close district centers of Salihli, [[Alaşehir]] and [[Kula, Manisa|Kula]], became a great opportunity to provide new employment opportunities in the region and accelerate the pace of industrialization.

Smaller industrial enterprises are concentrated in Salihli itself, where there are 32 brickworks and tileries drawing on the region's rich reserves in raw materials for bricks, two flour mills, two [[Quercus macrolepis|valonia oak]] factories, ten [[cotton gin]] factories, two grape operating works, one feed grain factory, one industrial tube factory, one tomato dressing factory, two olive oil mills, two beverage factories, one water bottling factory, one mineral water company and one emery rock factory.

'''Tourism:'''

The remains of [[Sardis]], which notably includes the Lydian King named [[Gyges of Lydia|Giges]]'s tomb, the [[Artemis]] Temple and a Marble Court with Gymnasium built by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], as well as other historical vestiges are widely visited by tourists, nationally and internationally.

{{Convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|14|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south of the town, there are lead and mud baths named {{Lang|tr|Kurşunlu Kaplıcaları}}, which are famous across the region.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} These thermal springs are visited especially to treat rheumatic disorders, [[sciatica]], [[lumbago]], [[arthritis]], [[neuralgia]], [[Orthopedic surgery|orthopaedic]] disorders, several skin diseases, some gynecological conditions and kidney disorders. Moreover, a recent [[geothermal energy]] production project intends to use these thermal sources and provide heating for the city of Salihli.

There are also many excursion possibilities around Salihli. Bozdağ summits and the [[Lake Gölcük]] located near the top of one of the summits is at a very high altitude. The restaurants and cafes situated on the hills around Bozdağ have views over Salihli.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

== Culture and sports activities ==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Odunkofte.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Odun köfte <br/>(wood-flame grilled meat balls); <br/>a local delicacy]] -->
Sporting activities are quite prominent, and the city was represented for a long time in the [[Türk Telekom League A|Turkish Second League]] by [[Yeni Salihlispor]]. Today, nearly 1500 licensed athletes compete in various sports activities in Salihli, such as [[association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[table tennis]], [[judo]], [[wrestling]], [[oil wrestling]], [[folk dance]] and [[chess]]. There are ten football clubs that represent Salihli in Turkey's amateur league, and one female volleyball club in the 2nd league. Under Salihli Municipality's structure, [[Turkish folk music]], [[Turkish Classical Music|Turkish classical music]] and children's chorus organizations also have a place, and modern [[ballet]] and other dance schools, folk dancing, piano, drawing and theater lessons are also supported. The judo team has previously won gold, silver and bronze medals in world championships and many other medals in national tournaments.

== Cuisine ==
Besides other Turkish dishes, Salihli has a particular [[köfte]] variety of its own, named {{Lang|tr|Odun Köfte}}. Gökeyüp village's [[güveç]] stews are also particularly famous in the region.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The production of high-quality grapes, especially [[Sultana (grape)|sultana grapes]], is also reflected in the cuisine. In wedding ceremonies held in the villages, dishes like [[keşkek]] and [[topalak]] are often cooked, and some people make their own [[rakı]] with sweet [[sultana (grape)|sultana]] grapes.
