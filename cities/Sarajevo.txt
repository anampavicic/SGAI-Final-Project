Although there is evidence of human settlement in the area since prehistoric times, the modern city arose in the 15th century as an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] stronghold when the Ottoman empire extended into Europe.{{sfn|Valerijan|Imamović|Ćurovac|Kurto|1997}} Sarajevo has gained international renown several times throughout its history. In 1885, it was the first city in Europe and the second city in the world to have a full-time electric tram network running through the city, following [[San Francisco]].<ref name="amazon1">{{cite book |title=Lonely Planet: Best Cities in the World |year=2006 |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=978-1-74104-731-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/lonelyplanetciti00lone}}</ref>

In 1914, Sarajevo was the site of the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] by a local [[Young Bosnia]] activist [[Gavrilo Princip]], a murder that sparked [[World War I]]. This resulted in the end of [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] rule in Bosnia and the creation of the multicultural [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] in the Balkan region. Later, after [[World War II]], the area was designated the capital of the communist [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] within the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], leading to rapid expansion of its population and businesses with investment in infrastructure and economic development.

In 1984, Sarajevo hosted the [[1984 Winter Olympics]], which marked a prosperous era for the city. However, after the start of the [[Yugoslav Wars]], the city suffered the [[Siege of Sarajevo|longest siege of a capital city in the history of modern warfare]], for a total of 1,425 days, from April 1992 to February 1996, during the [[Bosnian War]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Sarajevo Night Skyline Bosnia & Herzegovina 2014 (15510458883).jpg|thumb|left|Sarajevo at night]]

The name ''Sarajevo'' derives from the Turkish noun {{lang|tr|saray}}, meaning "palace" or "mansion" (from [[Persian language|Persian]] {{transl|fa|sarāy}}, {{nastaliq|سرای|fa}}, of the same meaning). Scholars disagree on the origin of the ''evo'' attached to the end. In Slavic languages, the addition of "[https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Suffixes_-evo,_-ova_and_-ovo#:~:text=The%20suffixes%20%2Dovo%20and%20%2Devo,omitted%20in%20the%20toponym%20itself. evo]" may indicate a possessive noun, thereby making the name of Sarajevo 'city of the palace'.

One theory is that the name may have been derived from the [[Ottoman Turkish]] term {{lang|ota-Latn|saray ovası}}, first recorded in 1455,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kkQQAAAAIAAJ |language=sh |title=Bosanski pašaluk: postanak i upravna podjela |author=Hazim Šabanović |publisher=Naučno društvo NR Bosne i Hercegovine |year=1959 |id=UDC 94(497.6)"14/17" |pages=28–37 |access-date=11 September 2012 |archive-date=10 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220310215425/https://books.google.com/books?id=kkQQAAAAIAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref> meaning "the plains around the palace" or simply "palace plains".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://translate.google.com/#tr/en/Saray%20Ovas%C4%B1 |title=Google Translate |access-date=25 September 2014 |archive-date=3 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200103171735/https://translate.google.com/#tr/en/Saray%20Ovas%C4%B1 |url-status=live }}</ref>

However, in his ''Dictionary of Turkish Loanwords'', [https://sr.m.wikipedia.org/sr/%D0%90%D0%B1%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%85_%D0%A8%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%99%D0%B8%D1%9B Abdulah Škaljić] maintains that the ''evo'' ending is more likely to have come from the widespread [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] suffix {{lang|sla|[[:wikt:Appendix:Suffixes -evo, -ova and -ovo|evo]]}} used to indicate place names, than from the Turkish ending {{lang|tr|ova}}.<ref>Škaljić, Abdulah. ''Turcizmi u srpskohrvatskom jeziku, Svjetlost,'' Sarajevo, 1989, šesto izdanje</ref> The first mention of the name Sarajevo was in a 1507 letter written by [[Firuz Bey]].{{Sfn|Tanzer|Longoria|2007|p=272}} The official name during the [[Ottoman Bosnia and Herzegovina|400 years of Ottoman rule]] was ''Saraybosna'' ("Palace of Bosnia"), which remains the city's name in Modern Turkish.

Sarajevo has had many nicknames. The earliest is {{lang|sh|Šeher}}, the term [[Isa-Beg Ishaković]] used to describe the town he was going to construct—which is Turkish for "city" ({{lang|tr|şehir}}), in turn coming from the Persian {{transl|fa|shahr}} ({{lang|fa|شهر}}, meaning "city"). As Sarajevo developed, numerous nicknames came from comparisons to other cities in the Islamic world, i.e. "[[Damascus]] of the North" and "European Jerusalem"; the latter being the most popular.

==Environment==
===Geography===
Sarajevo is near the geometric center of the triangular-shaped [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and within the historical region of [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia proper]]. It is situated {{cvt|518|m|ft|sp=us}} [[Height above sea level|above sea level]] and lies in the Sarajevo valley, in the middle of the [[Dinaric Alps]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sarajevo.ba/en/stream.php?kat=78 |title=About Sarajevo – Official Sarajevo statistics |date=6 September 2015 |publisher=sarajevo.ba |access-date=6 September 2015 |archive-date=29 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429094339/http://www.sarajevo.ba/en/stream.php?kat=78 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The valley was once an expansive, fertile, and green space, but considerable urban expansion and development took place following World War II. Forested hills and five major mountains surround the city. The highest of the surrounding peaks is [[Treskavica]] at {{cvt|2088|m|ft|sp=us}}, followed by [[Bjelašnica]] mountain at {{cvt|2067|m|ft|sp=us}}, [[Jahorina]] at {{cvt|1913|m|ft|sp=us}}, [[Trebević]] at {{cvt|1627|m|ft|sp=us}}, and [[Igman]] the shortest at {{cvt|1502|m|ft|sp=us}}. The last four are also known as the Olympic Mountains of Sarajevo.

When the city hosted the [[1984 Winter Olympics]], venues were constructed at these mountains for many winter sports events. The city is developed within hilly terrain; some steeply inclined streets and residences perch on the hillsides.

The [[Miljacka]] river is one of the city's chief geographic features. It flows through the city from east through the center of Sarajevo to the west part of the city, where it eventually meets up with the [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]] river. Miljacka River is also known as "The Sarajevo River". Its source (''Vrelo Miljacke'') is {{cvt|2|km|mi|abbr=off}} south of the town of [[Pale, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Pale]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://draganmocevic.com/vrelo-miljacke-sramota-za-turizam-republike-srpske-i-bih/#.VeuXgHtzqf4 |title=Vrelo Miljacke – sramota za turizam RS i BiH |date=23 December 2013 |publisher=draganmocevic.com |access-date=6 September 2015 |archive-date=16 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016032742/http://draganmocevic.com/vrelo-miljacke-sramota-za-turizam-republike-srpske-i-bih/#.VeuXgHtzqf4 |url-status=live }}</ref> at the foothills of Mount Jahorina, several kilometers to the east of Sarajevo center. The Bosna's source, [[Vrelo Bosne]] near [[Ilidža]] (west Sarajevo), is another notable natural landmark and a popular destination for Sarajevans and other tourists. Several smaller rivers and streams, such as [[Koševski Potok]], also run through the city and its vicinity.

===Cityscape===
[[File:Sarajevo – Iftar at Žuta tabija.jpg|thumb|right|View of Sarajevo from a popular [[Žuta Tabija|Yellow Bastion]] lookout]]

Sarajevo is close to the center of the triangular shape of Bosnia and Herzegovina in southeastern Europe. The Sarajevo city consists of four municipalities: [[Centar, Sarajevo|Centar]] (Center), [[Novi Grad, Sarajevo|Novi Grad]] (New Town), [[Novo Sarajevo]] (New Sarajevo), and [[Stari Grad, Sarajevo|Stari Grad]] (Old Town), while the [[Sarajevo metropolitan area]] (Greater Sarajevo area) includes these and the neighboring municipalities of [[Ilidža]], [[Hadžići]], [[Vogošća]] and [[Ilijaš]].

The Metropolitan area was reduced in the 1990s after the war and the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton-imposed administrative division]] of the country, with several municipalities partitioned along the border of the newly recognized [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (FBiH) and [[Republika Srpska]] (RS), creating several new municipalities which together form the city of [[Istočno Sarajevo]] in the Republika Srpska: [[Istočna Ilidža]], [[Istočno Novo Sarajevo]], [[Istočni Stari Grad]], [[Lukavica (Istočno Novo Sarajevo)|Lukavica]], [[Pale, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Pale (RS-section)]], and [[Trnovo, Republika Srpska|Trnovo (RS-section)]], along with the municipality of [[Sokolac]] (which was not traditionally part of the Sarajevo area and was not partitioned).

The city has an urban area of {{cvt|1041.5|km2|1|abbr=out}}. Veliki Park (Great Park) is the largest green area in the center of Sarajevo. It is nestled between [[Marshal Tito street (Sarajevo)|Titova]], [[Koševo]], [[Džidžikovac]], Tina Ujevića and Trampina Streets and in the lower part there is a monument dedicated to the Children of Sarajevo.

===Climate===
[[File:Sarajevo Veliki-Park 2011-11-08.jpg|thumb|Autumn in Sarajevo – Veliki Park]]

Sarajevo has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: '''Cfb''') bordering on a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: '''Dfb'''). Sarajevo's climate exhibits four seasons and uniformly spread precipitation. The proximity of the [[Adriatic Sea]] moderates Sarajevo's climate somewhat, although the mountains to the south of the city greatly reduce this maritime influence.<ref name="Lacan">{{cite journal |last=Lacan |first=Igor |author2=McBride, Joe R. |year=2009 |title=War and trees: The destruction and replanting of the urban and peri-urban forest of Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina |journal=Urban Forestry & Urban Greening |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=133–148 [134] |doi=10.1016/j.ufug.2009.04.001|bibcode=2009UFUG....8..133L }}</ref> The average yearly temperature is {{cvt|10|°C|0}}, with January ({{cvt|-0.5|°C|1}} on average) being the coldest month of the year and July ({{cvt|19.7|°C|1}} on average) the warmest.

===Ancient times===
{{Main|Stari Grad, Sarajevo}}
[[File:Butmirska vaza.jpg|thumb|[[Neolithic]] period [[Butmir culture|Butmir]] vase]]

One of the earliest findings of settlement in the Sarajevo area is that of the Neolithic [[Butmir culture]]. The discoveries at [[Butmir]] were made on the grounds of the modern-day Sarajevo suburb [[Ilidža]] in 1893 by [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] authorities during the construction of an agricultural school. The area's richness in [[flint]] was attractive to Neolithic humans, and the settlement flourished. The settlement developed unique ceramics and pottery designs, which characterize the Butmir people as a unique culture, as described at the International Congress of Archaeologists and [[anthropology|Anthropologists]] meeting in Sarajevo in 1894.<ref>[http://www.sarajevo-tourism.com/eng/sarajevothroughhistory.wbsp "The Culture & History"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212025705/http://www.sarajevo-tourism.com/eng/sarajevothroughhistory.wbsp |date=12 December 2007 }}, Tourism Association of Sarajevo Canton, Retrieved on 3 August 2006.</ref>

The next prominent culture in Sarajevo was the [[Illyrians]]. The ancient people, who considered most of the [[Balkans#Western Balkans|Western Balkans]] as their homeland, had several key settlements in the region, mostly around the river [[Miljacka]] and the Sarajevo valley. The Illyrians in the Sarajevo region belonged to the ''[[Daesitiates]]'', the last Illyrian people in Bosnia and Herzegovina to resist [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] occupation. Their defeat by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] emperor [[Tiberius]] in 9 AD marks the start of Roman rule in the region. The Romans never built up the region of modern-day Bosnia, but the [[Colonies in antiquity|Roman colony]] of Aquae Sulphurae was near the top of present-day Ilidža, and was the most important settlement of the time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aneks8komisija.com.ba/main.php?id_struct=50&lang=4&action=view&id=2498 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013171041/http://www.aneks8komisija.com.ba/main.php?id_struct=50&lang=4&action=view&id=2498 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-10-13 |title=Commission to preserve national monuments |date=2007-10-13 |access-date=2018-08-14}}</ref> After the Romans, the [[Goths]] settled the area, followed by the [[Slavs]] in the 7th century.<ref name=Brit>"Sarajevo", ''New Britannica'', volume 10, edition 15 (1989). {{ISBN|0-85229-493-X}}.</ref>

===Middle Ages===

During the [[Middle Ages]], Sarajevo was part of the Bosnian province of Vrhbosna near the traditional center of the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]]. Though a city named ''Vrhbosna'' existed, the exact settlement in Sarajevo at this time is [[History of Sarajevo#Middle Ages|debated]]. Various documents note a place called ''Tornik'' in the region, most likely in the area of the [[Marijin Dvor (Sarajevo)|Marijin Dvor]] neighborhood. By all indications, Tornik was a very small marketplace surrounded by a proportionally small village and was not considered very important by [[Dubrovnik|Ragusan]] merchants.

Other scholars say that ''Vrhbosna'' was a major town in the wider area of modern-day Sarajevo. [[Holy See|Papal]] documents say that in 1238, a cathedral dedicated to [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] was built in the area. Disciples of the notable saints [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Cyril]] and [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Methodius]] stopped in the region, founding a church near [[Vrelo Bosne]]. Whether or not the town was somewhere in the area of modern-day Sarajevo, the documents attest to its and the region's importance. There was also a citadel [[Hodidjed]] north-east to the [[Stari Grad, Sarajevo|Old City]], dating from around 1263 until it was occupied by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1429.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/65/sa/Sarajevo.html "Sarajevo"], ''[[Columbia Encyclopedia]]'', edition 6, Retrieved on 3 August 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829204950/http://www.bartleby.com/65/sa/Sarajevo.html |date=29 August 2006 }}</ref>

===Ottoman era===

[[File:Sarajevo Bascarsija Sebilj 2007-08-16 (7).jpg|thumb|The [[Sebilj in Sarajevo|Sebilj]] is a [[Ottoman Empire|pseudo-Ottoman]] style wooden [[fountain]] in the centre of [[Baščaršija]] square. The current structure is an 1891 reconstruction of the original, which burnt down in 1852]]

Sarajevo was founded by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 1450s upon its conquest of the region, with 1461 used as the city's founding date. The first Ottoman governor of [[Bosnia Eyalet|Bosnia]], [[Isa-Beg Ishaković]], transformed the cluster of villages into a city and state capital by building several key structures, including a mosque, a closed marketplace, a [[hamam]], a [[caravansarai]], a bridge, and of course the governor's palace ("Saray"), which gave the city its present name in conjunction with “evo”, a derivative of “ova” meaning lowland. The mosque was named "Careva Džamija" (the [[Emperor's Mosque]]) in honor of Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]]. With the improvements, Sarajevo quickly grew into the largest city in the region. By the [[15th century]] the settlement was established as a city, named ''Bosna-Saraj'', around the citadel in 1461.

Following the [[expulsion of Jews from Spain]] at the end of the 15th century, and the invitation from the Ottoman Empire to resettle their population, [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jews]] arrived in Sarajevo, which over time would become a leading center of Sephardic culture and the [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino language]]. Though relatively small in size, a Jewish quarter would develop over several blocks in [[Baščaršija]].

Many local Christians converted to Islam at this time. To accommodate the new pilgrims on the road to [[Mecca]], in 1541, [[Gazi Husrev-beg]]'s quartermaster Vekil-Harrach built a pilgrim's mosque which it is still known to this day as the [[Hadžijska Mosque]].

Under leaders such as the second governor Gazi Husrev-beg, Sarajevo grew at a rapid rate. Husrev-beg greatly shaped the physical city, as most of what is now the Old Town was built during his reign. Sarajevo became known for its large marketplace and numerous mosques, which by the middle of the 16th century numbered more than 100. At the peak of the empire, Sarajevo was the biggest and most important Ottoman city in the Balkans after [[Istanbul]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2016-03-29 |title=Life in Sarajevo |url=https://www.ius.edu.ba:443/life-sarajevo |access-date=2021-03-13 |website=International University of Sarajevo |archive-date=8 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220408054803/https://www.ius.edu.ba/life-sarajevo |url-status=live }}</ref> By 1660, the population of Sarajevo was estimated to be over 80,000.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Velikonja |first=Mitja |title=Religious Separation and Political Intolerance in Bosnia-Herzegovina |publisher=[[Texas A&M University Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=1-58544-226-7 |pages=121}}</ref> By contrast, [[Belgrade]] in 1683 had 100,000,<ref name="The History of Belgrade">{{cite web |url=http://www.belgradenet.com/belgrade_history_middle_ages.html |title=The History of Belgrade: Middle Ages - Turkish Conquest - Liberation of Belgrade |last=Belgradenet.com |website=www.belgradenet.com |access-date=26 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230032249/http://www.belgradenet.com/belgrade_history_middle_ages.html |archive-date=30 December 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[Zagreb]] as late as 1851 had 14,000 people. As political conditions changed, Sarajevo became the site of warfare.

[[File:Impressions of Sarajevo (2496832484).jpg|thumb|The [[Sarajevo Clock Tower]] and [[Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque]]]]

In 1697, during the [[Great Turkish War]], a raid was led by [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] of the [[Habsburg monarchy]] against the Ottoman Empire, [[Sacking of Sarajevo|which conquered Sarajevo and left it plague-infected and burned to the ground]]. After his men had looted thoroughly, they set the city on fire and destroyed nearly all of it in one day. Only a handful of neighborhoods, some mosques, and an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox church]] were left standing. Numerous other fires weakened the city, which was later rebuilt but never fully recovered from the destruction. By 1807, it had only some 60,000 residents.<ref name=":0" />

In the 1830s, several battles of the [[Bosnian uprising (1831–32)|Bosnian uprising]] had taken place around the city. These had been led by [[Husein Gradaščević]]. Today, a major city street is named ''Zmaj od Bosne'' (Dragon of Bosnia) in his honor. The rebellion failed and for several more decades, the Ottoman state remained in control of Bosnia.

The Ottoman Empire made Sarajevo an important administrative center by 1850. [[Baščaršija]] became the central commercial district and cultural center of the city in the 15th century when Isa-Beg Ishaković founded the town.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://roker.bloger.hr/post/bascarsija/1118045.aspx |title=Baščaršija |work=bloger.hr |access-date=24 September 2015 |archive-date=2 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502051957/http://roker.bloger.hr/post/bascarsija/1118045.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref> The toponym Baščaršija derives from the [[Turkish language]].

===Austria-Hungary===

[[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Austria-Hungary's occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] came in 1878 as part of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]], and [[Bosnian Crisis|complete annexation]] followed in 1908, angering the [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Serbs]]. Sarajevo was industrialized by Austria-Hungary, who used the city as a testing area for new inventions such as [[Trams in Sarajevo|tramways]], which were established in 1885 before they were later installed in [[Vienna]]. Architects and engineers wanting to help rebuild Sarajevo as a modern European capital rushed to the city. A fire that burned down a large part of the central city area (''čaršija'') left more room for redevelopment. As a result, the city has a unique blend of the remaining Ottoman city market and contemporary Western architecture. Sarajevo also has some examples of Secession- and Pseudo-[[Moors|Moorish]] styles that date from this period.

[[File:Latin Bridge in Sarajevo.jpg|thumb|The [[Latin Bridge]] was the site of the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|assassination of Franz Ferdinand]]]]

The [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] period was one of great development for the city, as the Western power brought its new acquisition up to the standards of the [[Victorian era|Victorian age]]. Various factories and other buildings were built at this time,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bhtourism.ba/eng/history_city.wbsp?wbf_mjesto=;1; |title=BH Tourism – History |access-date=2 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313141355/http://bhtourism.ba/eng/history_city.wbsp?wbf_mjesto=;1; |archive-date=13 March 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and a large number of institutions were both Westernized and modernized. For the first time in history, Sarajevo's population began writing in [[Latin alphabet|Latin script]].<ref name=Brit /><ref>FICE (International Federation of Educative Communities) Congress 2006.

Retrieved on 3 August 2006.</ref>
For the first time in centuries, the city significantly expanded outside its traditional borders. Much of the city's contemporary central municipality ([[Centar, Sarajevo|Centar]]) was constructed during this period.

Architecture in Sarajevo quickly developed into a wide range of styles and buildings. The [[Sarajevo cathedral|Sacred Heart Cathedral]], for example, was constructed using elements of [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-gothic]] and [[Romanesque architecture]]. The [[National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina|National Museum]], [[Sarajevska pivara|Sarajevo brewery]], and [[Vijećnica|City Hall]] were also constructed during this period. Additionally, Austrian officials made Sarajevo the first city in this part of Europe to have a [[tram]]way.

[[File:Academy of fine art and Festina lente.jpg|thumb|The [[Academy of Fine Arts Sarajevo|Academy of Fine Arts]] was originally built to serve as an [[Reformed Church in Austria|Evangelical Church]] in 1899]]

Although the Bosnia Vilayet ''[[de jure]]'' remained part of the Ottoman Empire, it was ''[[de facto]]'' governed as an integral part of Austria-Hungary with the Ottomans having no say in its day-to-day governance. This lasted until 1908 when the territory was formally annexed and turned into a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]], jointly controlled by both Austrian [[Cisleithania]] and Hungarian [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Transleithania]].

The event that triggered [[World War I]] was the  [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|assassination]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], along with his wife [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg]] in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914 by [[Gavrilo Princip]], a Bosnian Serb and self-declared Yugoslav, and member of [[Young Bosnia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/archduke-franz-ferdinand-assassinated |title=Archduke Franz Ferdinand assassinated – Jun 28, 1914 – HISTORY.com |work=history.com |access-date=29 September 2016 |archive-date=24 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924221049/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/archduke-franz-ferdinand-assassinated |url-status=live }}</ref> This was followed by the [[Anti-Serb riots in Sarajevo]], which resulted in two deaths and destruction of property.

In the ensuing war, however, most of the Balkan offensives occurred near Belgrade, and Sarajevo largely escaped damage and destruction. Following the war, Bosnia was annexed into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], and Sarajevo became the capital of the [[Drina Banovina|Drina Province]].

===Yugoslavia===

After World War I and pressure from the [[Royal Serbian Army]], alongside rebelling [[Slavs|Slavic]] nations in [[Austria-Hungary]], Sarajevo became part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. Though it held some political significance as the center of first the Bosnian region and then the Drinska Banovina, the city was no longer a national capital and saw a decline in global influence.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/travel/europe/la-tr-d-sarajevo-timeline-20140727-story.html |title=Timeline: A short history of Sarajevo and region |work=Los Angeles Times |date=25 July 2014 |access-date=16 April 2020 |archive-date=4 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200604115511/https://www.latimes.com/travel/europe/la-tr-d-sarajevo-timeline-20140727-story.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

During [[World War II]], the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's army was overrun by German and Italian forces. Following a German bombing campaign, Sarajevo was captured on 15 April 1941 by the [[16th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|16th Motorized Infantry Division]]. The [[Axis powers]] created the [[Independent State of Croatia]] and included Sarajevo in its territory.

Immediately following the occupation, the main Sephardi Jewish synagogue, [[Il Kal Grande]], was looted, burned, and destroyed by the [[Nazism|Nazis]]. Within a matter of months, the centuries-old Sephardi and Ashkenazi Jewish communities of Sarajevo, comprising the vast majority of [[History of the Jews in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Jewry]], would be rounded up in the Old Synagogue (Stari hram) and deported to their deaths in [[Concentration camps in the Independent State of Croatia|Croatian concentration camps]]. Roughly 85% of Bosnia's Jewish population would perish at the hands of the Nazis and the [[Ustaše]] [[The Holocaust in the Independent State of Croatia|during the Holocaust in the region]]. The [[Sarajevo Haggadah]] was the most important artifact which survived this period, smuggled out of Sarajevo and saved from the Nazis and Ustaše by the chief librarian of the National Museum, [[Derviš Korkut]].

On 12 October 1941, a group of 108 notable [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] citizens of Sarajevo signed the [[Resolution of Sarajevo Muslims]] by which they condemned the [[Genocide of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia|Genocide of Serbs]] organized by the Ustaše, made a distinction between the Bosniaks who participated in such persecutions and the rest of the Bosniak population, presented information about the persecutions of Bosniaks by Serbs, and requested security for all citizens of the country, regardless of their identity.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hadžijahić |first=Muhamed |title=Istorija Naroda Bosne i Hercegovine |year=1973 |publisher=Institut za istoriju radničkog pokreta |location=Sarajevo |language=sh |page=277 |chapter=Muslimanske rezolucije iz 1941 godine [Muslim resolutions of 1941] |chapter-url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/47323922/Muhamed-Hadzijahic-Muslimanske-rezolucije-1941 |access-date=11 September 2017 |archive-date=6 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306083030/https://www.scribd.com/doc/47323922/Muhamed-Hadzijahic-Muslimanske-rezolucije-1941 |url-status=live }}</ref> During the summer of 1941, Ustaše militia periodically interned and executed groups of [[Serbs in Sarajevo|Sarajevo Serbs]].<ref name=Balić>{{cite journal |last=Balić |first=Emily Greble |title=When Croatia Needes Serbs: Nationalism and Genocide in Sarajevo, 1941-1942 |journal=Slavic Review |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=116–138 |year=2009 |doi=10.2307/20453271 |jstor=20453271|doi-access=free }}</ref> In August 1941, they arrested about one hundred Serbs suspected of ties to the resistance armies, mostly church officials and members of the intelligentsia, and executed them or deported them to concentration camps.<ref name=Balić /> By mid-summer 1942, around 20,000 Serbs found refuge in Sarajevo from Ustaše terror.{{sfn|Gumz|1998|p=}}

In the period February–May 1945, [[Vjekoslav Luburić|Maks Luburić]] set up a Ustaše headquarters in a building known as [[Villa Luburić]] and used it as a torture and execution place whose 323 victims were identified after the war. The resistance was led by [[Vladimir Perić|Vladimir Perić Valter]], who died while leading the liberation of the city on 6 April 1945.

After the war, Sarajevo was the capital of the [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] within the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. The Republic Government invested heavily in Sarajevo, building many new residential blocks in the municipalities of [[Novi Grad, Sarajevo|Novi Grad]] and [[Novo Sarajevo]], while simultaneously developing the city's industry and transforming Sarajevo into a modern city. Sarajevo grew rapidly as it became an important regional industrial center in Yugoslavia. Between the end of the war and the end of Yugoslavia, the city grew from a population of 115,000 to more than 600,000 people. The [[Vraca Memorial Park]], a monument for victims of World War II, was dedicated on 25 November, the "[[Statehood Day (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]" when the [[State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|ZAVNOBIH]] held their first meeting in 1943.<ref name=Donia>{{cite book |last=Donia |first=Robert J. |title=Sarajevo: A Biography |year=2006 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |isbn=978-0-472-11557-0 |pages=240–241}}</ref>

A crowning moment of Sarajevo's time in Socialist Yugoslavia was the [[1984 Winter Olympics]]. Sarajevo beat out [[Sapporo]], Japan, and [[Falun]]/[[Gothenburg]], Sweden, to host the [[Olympic Games]]. The games were followed by a tourism boom, making the 1980s one of the city's most prosperous decades.<ref>Sachs, Stephen E. (1994).

When the siege ended, the concrete scars caused by mortar shell explosions left marks that were filled with red resin. After the red resin was placed, it left floral patterns, which led to them being dubbed [[Sarajevo Rose]]s.

Sarajevo's 600 years of history, influenced by both Western and Eastern empires, makes it a [[tourist attraction]] with splendid variations. The city has hosted travelers for centuries, because it was an important trading center during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] empires and because it was a natural stop for many routes between East and West. Examples of popular destinations in Sarajevo include the [[Vrelo Bosne]] park, the [[Sacred Heart Cathedral, Sarajevo|Sarajevo cathedral]], and the [[Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque]]. Tourism in Sarajevo is chiefly focused on historical, religious, and cultural sites and winter sports.

[[File:Bridge on Vrelo Bosne.jpg|thumb|The [[Vrelo Bosne|spring]] of the [[Bosna (river)|Bosna river]] is located in [[Ilidža]], a chief suburb of Sarajevo]]

There are many parks throughout the city and on the outskirts. A popular activity among locals is street chess, usually played at [[Trg Oslobođenja - Alija Izetbegović]]. Veliki Park is the largest green area in the center of Sarajevo. It is nestled between [[Marshal Tito street (Sarajevo)|Titova]], [[Koševo]], [[Džidžikovac]], Tina Ujevića and Trampina Streets and in the lower part, there is a monument dedicated to the [[Siege of Sarajevo#Casualties|Children of Sarajevo]].

Sarajevo is also famous for its city lookouts; including an observation deck on the [[Avaz Twist Tower]], Park Prinčeva restaurant, Vidikovac lookout (Mt. Trebević), Zmajevac lookout and Yellow/White fortresses lookouts (in [[Vratnik (Sarajevo)|Vratnik]]) as well as numerous other rooftops throughout the city (i.e. Alta Shopping Center, [[ARIA Centar]], Hotel Hecco Deluxe). A symbol of Sarajevo is the [[Sarajevo cable car|Trebević cable car]] which was reconstructed in 2018, also it is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the city taking visitors from the city center to Mount Trebević.

There is also a [[UNESCO]] tentative monument, the [[Old Jewish Cemetery, Sarajevo|Old Jewish Cemetery]], an almost 500 years old site that is the second-largest Jewish sepulchral complex in Europe, the one in [[Prague]] being the largest. It is also one of the most significant memorial complexes in the world.

==Transportation==
===Roads and highways===
Sarajevo's location in a valley between mountains makes it a compact city. Narrow city streets and a lack of parking areas restrict automobile traffic but allow better pedestrian and cyclist mobility. The two main roads are [[Marshal Tito street (Sarajevo)|Titova Ulica]] (Street of [[Josip Broz Tito|Marshal Tito]]) and the east–west [[Husein Gradaščević|Zmaj od Bosne]] (Dragon of Bosnia) highway (E761). Located roughly at the center of the country, Sarajevo is Bosnia's main intersection. The city is connected to all the other major cities by highway or national road like [[Zenica]], [[Banja Luka]], [[Tuzla]], [[Mostar]], [[Goražde]] and [[Foča]].

Tourists from [[Central Europe]] and elsewhere visiting [[Dalmatia]] driving via [[Budapest]] through Sarajevo also contribute to the traffic congestion in and around Sarajevo. The trans-European highway, [[European route E73|Corridor Vc]], runs through Sarajevo connecting it to Budapest in the north, and [[Ploče]] at the Adriatic Sea in the south.<ref>[http://www.bosmal.com/en/?lg=en&nav_ID=14 Corridor 5C.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328012107/http://www.bosmal.com/en/?lg=en&nav_ID=14 |date=28 March 2008 }} Retrieved on 5 August 2006.</ref> The highway is being built by the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina|government]] and should cost 3.5 billion [[Euro]]. Up until March 2012, the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] invested around 600 million euros in the A1. In 2014, the sections Sarajevo-Zenica and Sarajevo-[[Tarčin]] were completed including the [[Sarajevo Beltway]] ring road.

===Railway===
[[File:Sarajevo Railway-Station 2011-10-01 (3).JPG|thumb|[[Sarajevo main railway station]]]]

The [[Sarajevo main railway station]] was built in 1882 for the [[narrow-gauge railway]]. After [[World War II]], it was decided to replace the old station by a new [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalist]] building. The ceremonial completion of the station building took place in 1949. The station was electrified in 1967, as part of the early electrification program introduced in Bosnia up to 1969.

The [[Sarajevo–Ploče railway]] provides a connection to the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast. It holds the distinction of being the first 25 kV AC-electrified country in the former Yugoslavia, followed by Croatia and Serbia. Once, the [[Narrow-gauge railways in Bosnia and Herzegovina#East Bosnian railway|East Bosnian railway]] connected Sarajevo to [[Belgrade]].

====Metro plans====
To solve traffic congestion in the city, Sarajevo-based architect Muzafer Osmanagić proposed a study called "Eco Energy 2010–2015", proposing a subway system underneath the bed of the river [[Miljacka]]. The first line of Metro Sarajevo would connect [[Baščaršija]] with [[Otoka, Sarajevo|Otoka]]. This line would cost some 150 million [[Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark|KM]] and be financed by the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=November 12, 2010 |title=Metro rail in Sarajevo? |url=http://www.ekapija.ba/website/bih/page/366186_en |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118002845/http://www.ekapija.ba/website/bih/page/366186_en |archive-date=18 November 2010 |access-date=24 September 2015 |website=ekapija.ba}}</ref>

===Airport===
[[File:Sarajevo Airport 1 2024.jpg|thumb|[[Sarajevo International Airport]]]]
[[Sarajevo International Airport]] {{airport codes|SJJ}} is just a few kilometers southwest of the city and was voted Best European Airport With Under 1,000,000 Passengers at the 15th Annual ACI-Europe in [[Munich]] in 2005.

The first regular flights to Sarajevo using an airfield in the suburb of [[Butmir]] began in 1930 when the domestic airliner [[Aeroput]] opened a regular route linking [[Belgrade]] to [[Podgorica]] through Sarajevo.<ref name="aeroput">[http://www.europeanairlines.no/drustvo-za-vazdusni-saobracaj-a-d-aeroput-1927-1948/ Drustvo za Vazdusni Saobracaj A D – Aeroput (1927–1948)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210523020505/https://www.europeanairlines.no/drustvo-za-vazdusni-saobracaj-a-d-aeroput-1927-1948/ |date=23 May 2021 }} at europeanairlines.n</ref> Later, Aeroput opened a route that linked Sarajevo with [[Split, Croatia|Split]], [[Rijeka]], and [[Dubrovnik]], and in 1938, the first international flights were introduced when Aeroput extended the route Dubrovnik – Sarajevo – Zagreb to [[Vienna]], [[Brno]] and [[Prague]].<ref name="aeroput"/><ref>[http://www.sarajevotimes.com/aeroput-first-airline-landed-sarajevo/ Aeroput, the First Airline that Landed in Sarajevo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829125207/http://www.sarajevotimes.com/aeroput-first-airline-landed-sarajevo/ |date=29 August 2018 }} at sarajevotimes.com, 21-4-2014, retrieved 19-7-2014</ref> The airfield in Butmir remained in use until 1969.

The need for a new airport in Sarajevo, with an asphalt-concrete runway, was acknowledged in the mid-1960s when [[Jat Airways|JAT]], the Yugoslav national carrier at that time, began acquiring jet planes. The construction of the airport began in 1966 at its present location, not far from the old one.<ref name="jodogoairportassist.com">{{Cite web |title=Sarajevo International Airport Assist Services - JODOGO |url=https://www.jodogoairportassist.com/airports/sarajevo-international-airport |access-date=2024-07-13 |website=www.jodogoairportassist.com}}</ref>

Sarajevo Airport opened on 2 June 1969 for domestic traffic. In 1970, [[Frankfurt]] became the first international destination served. Most of the time the airport was a 'feeder' airport where passengers embarked for flights to Zagreb and Belgrade on their way to international destinations. Over time, the traffic volume steadily grew from 70,000 to 600,000 passengers a year.<ref name="jodogoairportassist.com"/> Later, during the [[Bosnian War]], the airport was used for [[United Nations|UN]] flights and humanitarian relief. Since the [[Dayton Agreement]] in 1995, the airport retook its role as the main air portal to Bosnia and Herzegovina.

''[[Oslobođenje]]'' (Liberation), founded in 1943, is Sarajevo's longest-running continuously circulating newspaper and the only one to survive the war.

The [[Radio and Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (BHRT) is Sarajevo's [[public broadcasting|public television]] station and was created in 1945 under the umbrella of the [[Yugoslav Radio Television]] (JRT). It had its first television program aired in 1961, while continuous programming started in 1969. It is one of three main TV stations in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Other stations based in the city include [[Hayat TV (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Hayat TV]], [[O Kanal]], [[OBN (TV channel)|OBN]], [[TVSA|TV Kantona Sarajevo]] and [[TV Alfa]].

The headquarters of [[Al Jazeera Balkans]] is also in Sarajevo, with a broadcasting studio at the top of the [[ARIA Centar]].

Higher education has a long and rich tradition in Sarajevo. The first institution that can be classified as a tertiary educational institution was a school of [[Sufism|Sufi]] philosophy established by [[Gazi Husrev-beg]] in 1537; numerous other religious schools have been established over time. In 1887, under the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a [[Sharia]] Law School began a five-year program.<ref>[http://www.sarajevo.ba/en/stream.php?kat=145 University of Sarajevo] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910081056/http://www.sarajevo.ba/en/stream.php?kat=145 |date=10 September 2015 }} on Sarajevo official web site</ref> In the 1940s, the [[University of Sarajevo]] became the city's first secular higher education institute, effectively building upon the foundations established by the Saraybosna Hanıka in 1537.

[[File:Sarajevo Haggadah.jpg|thumb|Copies of the [[Sarajevo Haggadah]]]]

Sarajevo has been home to many different religions for centuries, giving the city a range of diverse cultures. In the time of Ottoman occupation of Bosnia, [[Islam|Muslims]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], and [[Sephardi Jews]] all shared the city while maintaining distinctive identities. They were joined during the brief occupation by [[Austria-Hungary]] by a smaller number of [[Germans]], [[Hungarians]], [[Slovaks]], [[Czechs]] and [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. By 1909, about 50% of the city's inhabitants were Muslim, 25% were Catholic, 15% were Orthodox, and 10% were Jewish.<ref>''[[The New York Times]]'', 3 April 1909, p. 19. Quote: "Of the 40,000 inhabitants of Sarajevo, the present capital of Bosnia, nearly one-half are Mohammedan, about one-quarter Roman Catholic, 6,000 followers of the Greek Orthodox or Serb faith, and 4,000 Jews..." ([https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/20447865/ Newspapers.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127082029/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/20447865/ |date=27 January 2018 }})</ref>

Historically, Sarajevo has been home to several prominent Bosnian poets, scholars, philosophers, and writers. To list only a very few; [[Nobel Prize]]-winner [[Vladimir Prelog]] is from the city, as are the writer [[Zlatko Topčić]] and the poet [[Abdulah Sidran]]. Nobel Prize-winner [[Ivo Andrić]] attended high school in Sarajevo for two years. [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning director [[Danis Tanović]] lives in the city.

The [[Sarajevo National Theatre]] is the oldest professional theater in Bosnia and Herzegovina, having been established in 1921.

===Music===
{{See also|List of Bosnia and Herzegovina patriotic songs}}
[[File:Tifa i Bregovic Nis polovina 80-ih.jpg|thumb|[[Bijelo Dugme]], widely considered to have been the most popular band ever to exist in the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and one of the most important acts of the [[Popular music in Yugoslavia|Yugoslav rock scene]], originated in Sarajevo. Pictured are [[Mladen Vojičić Tifa]] (left) and [[Goran Bregović]]]]

Sarajevo is and has historically been one of the most important musical enclaves in the region. The Sarajevo school of [[pop rock]] developed in the city between 1961 and 1991. This type of music began with bands like [[Indexi]], [[Kodeksi]], and singer-songwriter [[Kemal Monteno]]. It continued into the 1980s, with bands such as [[Plavi orkestar]], [[Crvena jabuka]], and [[Divlje jagode]], by most accounts, pioneering the [[Balkans|regional]] rock and roll movement. Sarajevo was also the home and birthplace of arguably the most popular and influential Yugoslav [[Band (rock and pop)|rock band]] of all time, [[Bijelo Dugme]], somewhat of a Bosnian parallel to the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]], in both popularity and influence.

Sarajevo was also the home of a very notable [[post-punk]] urban subculture known as the [[New Primitivism|New Primitives]], which began during the early 1980s with the Baglama Band which was banned shortly after its first LP and was brought into the mainstream through bands such as [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]] and [[Elvis J. Kurtović & His Meteors]], as well as the ''[[Top lista nadrealista]]'' radio, and later television show. Other notable bands considered to be part of this subculture are [[Bombaj Štampa]]. Besides and separately from the New Primitives, Sarajevo is the hometown to one of the most significant [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|ex-Yugoslavian]] alternative [[industrial music|industrial]]-[[Noise music|noise]] bands, [[SCH (band)|SCH]].

[[File:Evstafiev-bosnia-cello.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vedran Smailović]] playing the cello on top of the ruins of the [[National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina|National library]] in 1992]]

Perhaps more importantly, Sarajevo in the late 19th and throughout the 20th century was home to a burgeoning and large center of [[Sevdalinka]] record-making and contributed greatly to bringing this historical genre of music to the mainstream, which had for many centuries been a staple of Bosnian culture. Songwriters and musicians such as [[Himzo Polovina]], [[Safet Isović]], [[Zaim Imamović (musician)|Zaim Imamović]], [[Zehra Deović]], [[Halid Bešlić]], [[Hanka Paldum]], [[Nada Mamula]], [[Meho Puzić]] and many more composed and wrote some of their most important pieces in the city.
Sarajevo also greatly influenced the pop scene of Yugoslavia with musicians like [[Zdravko Čolić]], Kemal Monteno, [[Dino Merlin]], [[Seid Memić Vajta]], [[Hari Mata Hari]], [[Mladen Vojičić Tifa]], [[Željko Bebek]] and many more.

Many newer Sarajevo-based bands have also found a name and established themselves in Sarajevo, such as [[Regina (Bosnia and Herzegovina band)|Regina]] who also had two albums out in Yugoslavia, and Letu Štuke, who actually formed their band in Yugoslavia with the famous Bosnian-American writer [[Aleksandar Hemon]] and got their real breakthrough later in the 2000s. Sarajevo is now home to an important and eclectic mix of new bands and independent musicians, which continue to thrive with the ever-increasing number of festivals, creative showcases, and concerts around the country. The city is also home to the region's largest jazz festival, the [[Jazz Fest Sarajevo]].

American heavy metal band [[Savatage]], released a song entitled "[[Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24|Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)]]" on their 1995 album ''[[Dead Winter Dead]]'', which was about a [[cello]] player playing a forgotten [[Christmas carol]] in war-torn Sarajevo. The song was later re-released by the same band under the name [[Trans-Siberian Orchestra]] on their 1996 debut album ''[[Christmas Eve and Other Stories]]'', which the song gave them instant success.
