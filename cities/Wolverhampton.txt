Wolverhampton is recorded as being the site of a [[Battle of Tettenhall|decisive battle]] between the unified Mercian Angles and West Saxons against the raiding Danes in 910, although sources are unclear as to whether the battle itself took place in [[Wednesfield]] or [[Tettenhall]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Horovitz |first= David |title= Notes and Materials on the Battle of Tettenhall 910 A.D., and Other Researches |year= 2010 |publisher= David Horovitz |isbn= 978-0-9550309-1-8}}</ref>  Both places have since been incorporated into Wolverhampton.

In 994, a [[monastery]] was consecrated in Wolverhampton for which Wulfrun granted land at [[Upper Arley]] in Worcestershire, [[Bilston]], [[Willenhall]], Wednesfield, [[Pelsall]], [[Ogley Hay]] near [[Brownhills]], Hilton near [[Wall, Staffordshire|Wall]], [[Hatherton, Staffordshire|Hatherton]], [[Kinvaston]], Hilton near Wolverhampton, and [[Featherstone, Staffordshire|Featherstone]].<ref name="Wulfruna"/> This became the site for the current [[St Peter's Collegiate Church|St. Peter's Church]].<ref name="WHHS">{{cite web |title= History of Wolverhampton |publisher= Wolverhampton History and Heritage Society |url= http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/history/farley/oldwlv.htm |access-date= 13 June 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071024161026/http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/history/farley/oldwlv.htm |archive-date= 24 October 2007 |url-status= live }}</ref> A statue of Lady Wulfrun, sculpted by [[Charles Wheeler (sculptor)|Sir Charles Wheeler]], can be seen on the stairs outside the church.<ref name="Wulfruna"/>

Wolverhampton is recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086 as being in the [[Hundred (county division)|Hundred]] of [[Seisdon]] and the county of [[Staffordshire]]. The lords of the manor are listed as the canons of St Mary (the church's dedication was changed to St Peter after this date), with the tenant-in-chief being [[Samson (bishop of Worcester)|Samson]], [[William the Conqueror]]'s personal chaplain.<ref>Mander, G.P.

In 1179, there is mention of a market held in the town, and in 1204 it had come to the attention of [[John of England|King John]] that the town did not possess a Royal Charter for holding a market. This charter for a weekly market held on a Wednesday was eventually granted on 4 February 1258 by [[Henry III of England|Henry III]].<ref name="WHHS"/>

It is held that in the 14th and 15th centuries that Wolverhampton was one of the "staple towns" of the woollen trade,<ref name="WHHS"/> which today can be seen by the inclusion of a woolpack on the city's coat of arms,<ref name="Coat of arms">{{cite web |title=Wolverhampton Coat of Arms – Wolverhampton History |url=http://www.wolverhamptonhistory.org.uk/politics/local_government/wolves/coat_arms/index.html?sid=d988a0dcd52acacef8612d4e5f01f4e6 |publisher=Wolverhampton City Council |access-date=11 June 2008 }} {{Dead link|date=November 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and by the many small streets, especially in the city centre, called "Fold" (examples being Blossom's Fold, Farmers Fold, Townwell Fold and Victoria Fold), as well as Woolpack Street and Woolpack Alley.<ref name="WHHS"/>

In 1512, Sir [[Stephen Jenyns]], a former [[Lord Mayor of London]] and a twice Master of the [[Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors]], who was born in the city, founded [[Wolverhampton Grammar School]], one of the oldest active schools in Britain.<ref>{{cite web |title= Wolverhampton Grammar School |publisher= Wolverhampton Grammar School |url= http://www.wolverhamptongrammarschool.com/pages/prospective/history.aspx |access-date= 16 June 2008 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080618220854/http://www.wolverhamptongrammarschool.com/pages/prospective/history.aspx |archive-date= 18 June 2008 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>

From the 16th century onwards, Wolverhampton became home to a number of metal industries including lock and [[Key (lock)|key]] making and iron and [[brass]] working.

Wolverhampton suffered two Great Fires: the first in April 1590, and the second in September 1696. Both fires started in today's Salop Street. The first fire lasted for five days and left nearly 700 people homeless, whilst the second destroyed 60 homes in the first five hours. This second fire led to the purchase of the first [[fire engine]] within the city in September 1703.<ref name="WHHS"/>

There is also evidence that Wolverhampton may have been the location of the first working [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomen Steam Engine]] in 1712.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rana |first=Suhail |title=New evidence supporting Wolverhampton as the location of the first working Newcomen engine |journal=International Journal for the History of Engineering and Technology |year=2009 |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=162–173|doi=10.1179/175812109X449595 |s2cid=110962735 }}</ref>

A few years before she began her reign, [[Queen Victoria]] visited Wolverhampton in the 1830s and described it as "a large and dirty town" but one which received her "with great friendliness and pleasure". In [[Victorian era|Victorian times]], Wolverhampton grew to be a wealthy town mainly due to the huge amount of industry that occurred as a result of the abundance of coal and iron deposits in the area. The remains of this wealth can be seen in local houses such as [[Wightwick Manor]] and The Mount (both built for the prominent varnish and paint manufacturers, the [[Mander family]]) as well as Tettenhall Towers. All three are located in the western fringe of Wolverhampton, in the areas known as Wightwick and Tettenhall. Many other houses of similar stature were demolished in the 1960s and 1970s.

Wolverhampton gained its first parliamentary representation as part of the [[Reform Act 1832]], when it was one of 22 large towns that were allocated two members of parliament. A local mob attacking electors who voted or intended to vote for the [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] candidate led to the [[1835 Wolverhampton riot]], with [[dragoon]]s being called in to end the intimidation.

Mass [[council housing]] development in Wolverhampton, to rehouse families from slum housing, began after the end of the [[World War I]], with new estates at Parkfields (near the border with [[Coseley]]) and Birches Barn (near Bantock Park in the west of Wolverhampton) being built, giving the city some 550 new council houses by 1923, although this was a fraction of the number of new council houses required.

As well as the many new council estates which sprang up around Wolverhampton during the 20th century, several older parts of the town were redeveloped for new council housing during the 1960s and early 1970s. The most notable example is the Heath Town area, where almost all of the 19th-century buildings were demolished during the 1960s and replaced by four tower blocks and several blocks of maisonettes. However, the state housing at Heath Town quickly became unpopular and by the 1980s the area was plagued with crime and unemployment. The first regeneration projects on the estate began during the 1990s, and in 2017 some of the maisonette blocks were demolished. A similar redevelopment took place around the same time in Blakenhall, where new shops and five tower blocks were built in a 1960s redevelopment area. However, all of these buildings were demolished between 2002 and 2011 and have since been replaced with new private and social housing.

Large numbers of black and Asian immigrants settled in Wolverhampton in the 1940s{{citation needed|date=August 2024}}, 1950s and 1960s, mostly settling in the [[Blakenhall]], [[All Saints, Wolverhampton|All Saints]], [[Whitmore Reans]] and [[Heath Town]] areas.

This was officially opened by [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], on 31 July 1992.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wulfrun |first=Lady The original station has since been converted into apartments. |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/8050359@N07/1020232961/ |title=Market Street, Wolverhampton June 1981. |date=5 August 2007 |publisher=Flickr |access-date=24 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322184241/http://www.flickr.com/photos/8050359@N07/1020232961/ |archive-date=22 March 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The city centre had several cinemas during the 20th century. The last of these was the ABC Cinema (formerly the Savoy), which closed in 1991 after 54 years. It was then converted into a nightclub, with part of the site being converted into the offices of a [[recruitment agency]] in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/articles/Cinemas/Cinemas.htm |title=A Century of Cinema in Wolverhampton |publisher=Localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk |access-date=24 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712052512/http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/articles/Cinemas/Cinemas.htm |archive-date=12 July 2012  }}</ref> The building was demolished in 2019 to make way for an extension to the [[City of Wolverhampton College]]'s Metro One campus.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/local-hubs/wolverhampton/2019/07/18/wolverhampton-college-campus-to-be-sold-off-after-city-centre-move/|title=Wolverhampton College campus to be sold off after city centre move|date=18 July 2019|newspaper=Express and Star|access-date=8 February 2023}}</ref>

A modern landmark in the city centre is the [[Wolverhampton Combined Court Centre]] on Pipers Row, which opened in 1990 as the town's first purpose-built crown court.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wolverhampton's Architectural Heritage|url=http://www.wolverhamptonarchives.dial.pipex.com/local_heritage_civic.htm |access-date=6 March 2010|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515064941/http://www.wolverhamptonarchives.dial.pipex.com/local_heritage_civic.htm |archive-date=15 May 2008}}</ref>

===21st century===

A few department store chains including [[Marks & Spencer]] and [[Next plc|Next]] have stores in the centre of Wolverhampton. [[Beatties]], a [[House of Fraser]] store, was announced to close in 2019.<ref name=eas20180607>Penfold, Simon [https://www.expressandstar.com/news/business/2018/06/07/140-years-of-city-history-faces-the-end-with-beatties-set-to-close-next-year/ 140 years of city history faces the end with Beatties closure] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612141336/https://www.expressandstar.com/news/business/2018/06/07/140-years-of-city-history-faces-the-end-with-beatties-set-to-close-next-year/ |date=12 June 2018 }}, [[Express & Star]], Wolverhampton, 7 June 2018.

This building was then divided between a [[Netto (store)|Netto]] supermarket and the local archives service, but by 2006 its future was under threat as part of the proposed Summer Row retail development. This led to the closure of the Netto supermarket in June 2007 and the relocation of the archives service to the Molineux Hotel building in 2008. The building has since been demolished toward a development push from the Local Authority at various sites around the city.  The site is now home to a relocated outdoor market.

Following the closure of the Mander Centre branch of [[Tesco]] and relocation of [[Sainsbury's]], the only remaining supermarket in the central shopping area was [[Iceland (supermarket)|Iceland]]. In September 2023 a Tesco Express convenience store opened in Dudley Street replacing a branch of Clinton Cards. Outside the Ring Road were major branches of [[Sainsbury's]], [[Asda]] and [[Waitrose]]. The Waitrose store, originally a branch of Safeway which Morrisons were forced to sell off as part of the acquisition of the supermarket chain, closed at the end of trading on 31 December 2020. The store was sold to [[Tesco]] which opened in June 2021. [[Aldi]] have two stores close to the city centre: one just off the [[A4123 road|A4123]] Birmingham Road and a newer branch close to the former Wolverhampton Low Level railway station in Sun Street.

In 2021, a [[blue plaque]] was erected in memory of British immigrant rights activist [[Paulette Wilson]], a member of the [[Windrush generation]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Vukmirovic|first=James|title=Paulette Wilson: Windrush campaigner's life honoured with ceremony and plaque|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/local-hubs/wolverhampton/whitmore-reans/2021/06/22/paulette-wilson-windrush-campaigners-life-honoured-with-ceremony-and-plaque/|access-date=25 June 2021|website=www.expressandstar.com|date=22 June 2021 |language=en|archive-date=25 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210625191544/https://www.expressandstar.com/news/local-hubs/wolverhampton/whitmore-reans/2021/06/22/paulette-wilson-windrush-campaigners-life-honoured-with-ceremony-and-plaque/|url-status=live}}</ref> The plaque was launched with campaigners including [[Patrick Vernon]] and [[Claire Darke]] at the Wolverhampton Heritage Centre.<ref>{{Cite web|date=22 June 2021|title=Plaque for Windrush campaigner unveiled at former office of Enoch Powell|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jun/22/plaque-honouring-windrush-campaigner-unveiled-at-enoch-powell-office|access-date=25 June 2021|website=The Guardian|language=en|archive-date=24 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624224828/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jun/22/plaque-honouring-windrush-campaigner-unveiled-at-enoch-powell-office|url-status=live}}</ref> The Centre is a cornerstone of the area's local Caribbean community and was formerly the constituency office of [[Enoch Powell]] where the infamous [[Rivers of Blood speech]] was written.<ref>{{Cite news|date=22 June 2021|title=Paulette Wilson, late Windrush campaigner, to be honoured with blue plaque|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/paulette-wilson-windrush-blue-plaque-b1870184.html|access-date=25 June 2021|work=[[The Independent]]|language=en|archive-date=25 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210625191542/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/paulette-wilson-windrush-blue-plaque-b1870184.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities====
On 20 February 2021, it was announced as part of the government's levelling up strategy, that what is now the [[Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities]] would be the first government department to have a headquarters based outside of London. Five hundred posts, including those of senior civil servants, will be moving to Wolverhampton by 2025.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/politics/2021/02/20/wolverhampton-chosen-for-new-government-department-headquarters/|title=First government department HQ outside London to be based in Wolverhampton|first=Peter|last=Madeley|website=www.expressandstar.com|date=20 February 2021 |access-date=22 February 2021|archive-date=21 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210221222659/https://www.expressandstar.com/news/politics/2021/02/20/wolverhampton-chosen-for-new-government-department-headquarters/|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 23 February 2021, the then Secretary of State, [[Robert Jenrick]], announced he was hopeful that staff would be working in Wolverhampton by the summer of 2021. He also announced that they were considering building a new office development in or around the city centre to house the new headquarters. The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, suggested it should be within walking distance of local newspaper ''[[Express & Star]]'', where he previously did work experience.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/local-hubs/wolverhampton/2021/02/23/hundreds-of-civil-servants-set-to-be-stationed-in-new-purpose-built-office/|title=Hundreds of civil servants set to be stationed in new purpose-built office|first=Peter|last=Madeley|date=23 February 2021|access-date=20 September 2021|work=[[Express & Star]]|archive-date=20 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210920212839/https://www.expressandstar.com/news/local-hubs/wolverhampton/2021/02/23/hundreds-of-civil-servants-set-to-be-stationed-in-new-purpose-built-office/|url-status=live}}</ref>

As DLUHC looks set to relocate some 500 members of staff to Wolverhampton, Robert Jenrick officially opened its new Wolverhampton offices at  the recently completed i9 office development on 10 September 2021. At the opening of the new office development the Secretary of State was joined by the leader of [[City of Wolverhampton Council]] Ian Brookfield and the West Midlands Mayor, [[Andy Street]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/politics/2021/09/10/from-whitehall-to-wolverhampton-government-branches-out-with-city-move/|title=From Whitehall to Wolverhampton: Government branches out with city move|work=[[Express & Star]]|date=10 September 2021|access-date=20 September 2021|archive-date=17 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210917124042/https://www.expressandstar.com/news/politics/2021/09/10/from-whitehall-to-wolverhampton-government-branches-out-with-city-move/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Art and culture===

From the 18th century, Wolverhampton was well known for production of [[japanned ware]] and steel jewellery. The renowned 18th- and 19th-century artists [[Joseph Barney]] (1753–1832), [[Edward Bird]] (1772–1819), and [[George Wallis]] (1811–1891) were all born in Wolverhampton and initially trained as japanned ware painters.

The School of Practical Art was opened in the 1850s and eventually became a close associate of the Art Gallery. Among its students and teachers were Robert Jackson Emerson (1878–1944), Sir Charles Wheeler (Emerson's most famous pupil and the sculptor of the fountains in [[Trafalgar Square]]), [[Sara Page]] who established her studio in Paris, and many other artists and sculptors recognised locally and nationally.

[[Wolverhampton Art Gallery]] was established in 1884, whilst [[Wolverhampton Grand Theatre]] was opened in 1894.

There is a Creative Industries Quarter in Wolverhampton, just off Broad Street, with facilities ranging from the newly opened [[Slade Rooms]], to the art house cinema the [[Light House Media Centre]] (closed in 2022) and the Arena Theatre, which is part of the [[University of Wolverhampton]].

Wolverhampton has a strong history in the ornate cast iron safe painting industry from the Victorian era. Numerous companies, such as [[Chubb Locks|Chubb Lock and Safe Company]], hired, taught and expanded their artistic status to international reputation, whereby a safe became truly a work of art with fine script and hand-painted designs, highly collectible today. Even in the United States, one can find their preserved masterpieces to this day. The building was converted into a National Historic Registered Landmark Treasure in 1992, which now houses a cinema, art galleries, nightclub, business offices and a large stained glass [[rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] in its foyer. It is among the few canal street factories so well known in the "Black Country" that has been preserved.

Wolverhampton's biggest public art display took place between July and September 2017; [[Wolves in Wolves]] saw the installation of 30 wolf sculptures in the city centre and West Park, with the sculptures auctioned off to raise money for charity.

===Exhibitions===
As its wealth and influence grew, Wolverhampton both took part in notable exhibitions and hosted them. [[The Great Exhibition]] of 1851, at [[The Crystal Palace]], had examples of locks, [[Japanning#Wolverhampton and Bilston|japanned ware]], [[Vitreous enamel|enamel ware]] and [[Papier-mâché#Europe|papier-mâché]] products all manufactured in Wolverhampton.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/articles/grtexhib/gtexhib.htm |title=Wolverhampton at the Great Exhibition, 1851 |author=Frank Sharman |publisher=Wolverhampton History & Heritage Website |access-date=15 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203034353/http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/articles/grtexhib/gtexhib.htm |archive-date=3 February 2013  }}</ref>

Following successful exhibitions at Mechanics' Institutes in [[Manchester]] and many northern towns, Wolverhampton held an exhibition that was the brain child of [[George Wallis]], an artist employed by the firm of Ryton and Walton. The exhibition was held in the Mechanics' Institute in Queen Street and showed fine art, furniture, and decorated trays, as well as a variety of ironwork, locks and steel toys.<ref name="Exhibitions">{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/articles/electronic/exhibs/wolverhampton_exhibitions.htm |title=Exhibitions Great and Small |author=Frank Sharman |publisher=Wolverhampton History & Heritage |access-date=15 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307093643/http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/articles/electronic/exhibs/wolverhampton_exhibitions.htm |archive-date=7 March 2012  }}</ref>

On 11 May 1869 [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|The Earl Granville]] opened the Exhibition of Staffordshire Arts and Industry in a temporary building in the grounds of Molineux House.<ref name="Exhibitions"/>

The largest and most ambitious exhibition was the Arts and Industrial Exhibition which took place in 1902. Although housing only one international pavilion, from Canada, the scope and scale of the exhibition mirrored all the advances in other exhibitions of its time. The exhibition site featured several halls housing machinery, industrial products, a concert hall, two bandstands, a restaurant, and a fun fair with thrill rides and a water chute. Its opening, by the [[Duke of Connaught]], was received with hopeful enthusiasm, unfortunately not matched by the weather, which contributed to a £30,000 loss, equivalent to nearly £2M at today's value.<ref name="Exhibitions"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/results.asp#mid |title=Currency Converter |publisher=National Archive |access-date=16 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203175803/http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/results.asp#mid |archive-date=3 December 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Geography==
Wolverhampton lies northwest of its larger near-neighbour [[Birmingham]], and forms the second largest part of the [[West Midlands conurbation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/census2001/ks_urban_midlands_part_1.pdf |title=Key Statistics for Urban Areas in the Midlands |publisher=Office for National Statistics |access-date=2 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20040724075135/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/census2001/ks_urban_midlands_part_1.pdf |archive-date=24 July 2004  }}</ref> To the north and west lies the [[Staffordshire]] and [[Shropshire]] countryside.

Wolverhampton city centre falls outside of the area traditionally known as the [[Black Country]], although some areas such as the town and former borough of [[Bilston]] and [[Heath Town]] and the [[Willenhall]] side of Wolverhampton fall within the Black Country [[coalfield]]s, leading to confusion as to whether the entire city falls within the region. Modern usage has tended towards using the term to refer to the western part of the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands county]], excluding Birmingham, [[Metropolitan Borough of Solihull|Solihull]] and [[Coventry]]. Examples would be UK Government regional bodies such as the [[Black Country Development Corporation]], under whose remit the city fell.

The city lies upon the [[Midlands Plateau]] at {{Convert|163|m|ft}} above sea level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://elevationmap.net/5a-market-st-wolverhampton-west-midlands-wv1-3ae-uk?latlngs=(52.58467847246639,-2.1253867724609563)|title=5a Market St Wolverhampton West Midlands Wv1 3ae Uk on the Elevation Map.

This means that the city lies astride the main east–west [[Drainage divide|watershed]] of England.

The geology of the city is complex, with a combination of [[Triassic]] and [[Carboniferous]] geology; specifically [[Bunter (geology)|Bunter]] and [[Keuper]] [[sandstone]], and Upper and Middle [[Coal measures]]. There is also an area of [[Diabase|dolerite]] intrusions.<ref>{{cite book |author=The West Midland Group |title=Conurbation: A Survey of Birmingham and the Black Country |page=41 |year=1948 |publisher=The Architectural Press |location=London}}</ref>

===Climate===
Wolverhampton's climate is [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb'') and therefore quite temperate, with average maximum temperatures in July being around {{convert|21|°C|°F|0}}, and with the maximum daytime temperature in January being around {{convert|6.9|°C|°F}}.

The [[Met Office]]'s nearest [[Penkridge weather station|observation station]] is at [[Penkridge]], about {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} north of the city.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

Wolverhampton has [[green belt]] within its boundary, as a part of the wider West Midlands Green Belt.

==Government==
The vast majority of Wolverhampton is governed locally by City of Wolverhampton Council, although some smaller parts of the urban area are governed by [[South Staffordshire]] District Council.

The area administered by the City Council is represented in the national United Kingdom parliament by three MPs representing [[Wolverhampton West (UK Parliament constituency)|Wolverhampton West]], [[Wolverhampton South East (UK Parliament constituency)|Wolverhampton South East]] and [[Wolverhampton North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Wolverhampton North East]] constituencies, with the areas administered by South Staffordshire District Council being represented by [[South Staffordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Staffordshire constituency]]. The entire city was part of the [[West Midlands (European Parliament constituency)|West Midlands constituency]] of the European Parliament.

===City of Wolverhampton Council===

{{Main|City of Wolverhampton Council}}The City of Wolverhampton is a [[metropolitan borough]], meaning that its City Council is effectively a [[unitary authority]], and therefore is single-tier and provides all services to the district that a borough and county council would together. South Staffordshire District Council is a two-tier authority, with some services provided by [[Staffordshire]] County Council.
The council offices are in the [[Wolverhampton Civic Centre]], which is located in St Peter's Square in the city centre.<ref>{{cite web |title=City of Wolverhampton Council: Contact Us |publisher=City of Wolverhampton Council|url=http://www.wolverhampton.gov.uk/Contact_us/ |access-date=29 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523121640/http://www.wolverhampton.gov.uk/Contact_us |archive-date=23 May 2008  }}</ref> The city council's motto is 'Out of darkness cometh light'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/listed/lowhill%20lib/lowhillib.htm |title=Low Hill Branch Library |publisher=Wolverhampton History & Heritage Society |access-date=8 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202074117/http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/listed/lowhill%20lib/lowhillib.htm |archive-date=2 December 2007  }}</ref>

Wolverhampton gained the beginnings of modern local government in 1777, when the Wolverhampton Improvement Act was passed by Parliament. This allowed for the establishment of 125 Town Commissioners who undertook a variety of local improvement work such as punishing bear baiting, improving drainage, widening streets and by the end of the century street lighting had been provided at every street corner and over the doorway of every inn, and water supply had been improved by the sinking of ten new wells and the provision of a great water tank in the market place. Policing had been improved with the appointment of ten watchmen and attempts were also made to regulate the markets and inspect hazardous food.<ref name="farley"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wolverhamptonhistory.org.uk/politics/local_government/wolves/index.html?sid=14003c39a8d30c9d4326cdaba02d54e8 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121224110143/http://www.wolverhamptonhistory.org.uk/politics/local_government/wolves/index.html?sid=14003c39a8d30c9d4326cdaba02d54e8 |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 December 2012 |title=Local Government in Wolverhampton |work=The History of Wolverhampton – The City and its People |year=2005 |access-date=15 July 2007 }}</ref>

[[Wolverhampton (UK Parliament constituency)|Wolverhampton parliamentary borough]] was created by the [[Reform Act 1832]], which included areas currently located with the Metropolitan Boroughs of [[Metropolitan Borough of Dudley|Dudley]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Walsall|Walsall]] and [[Sandwell]] such as [[Wren's Nest]], [[New Invention, Walsall|New Invention]] and [[Sedgley]]. It was one of 22 large towns that returned two members of parliament.  Under the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]], the original borough was replaced by three new single-member constituencies: [[Wolverhampton East (UK Parliament constituency)|Wolverhampton East]], [[Wolverhampton South (UK Parliament constituency)|Wolverhampton South]] and [[Wolverhampton West (UK Parliament constituency)|Wolverhampton West]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wolverhamptonhistory.org.uk/politics/parliamentary_representation |title=Parliamentary Representation |publisher=Wolverhampton Archives and Local Studies |access-date=29 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120193746/http://www.wolverhamptonhistory.org.uk/politics/parliamentary_representation |archive-date=20 January 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1837, [[Wolverhampton Borough Police]] was formed. It was disestablished in 1966, and the larger [[West Midlands Constabulary]], which covered not only Wolverhampton but the County Boroughs of [[Walsall]], [[Dudley]], [[West Bromwich]] and [[County Borough of Warley|Warley]] took over its duties and was headquartered in the city. This force was then replaced in 1974 with the West Midlands Police.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westmidlandspolicemuseum.co.uk/wolverhamptonboroughpolice.htm |title=Wolverhampton Borough Police |publisher=West Midlands Police Museum |access-date=23 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724231642/http://www.westmidlandspolicemuseum.co.uk/wolverhamptonboroughpolice.htm |archive-date=24 July 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Wolverhampton was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]] in 1848 under the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]].<ref name=StaffsArchive>{{cite web |url=http://www.staffordshire.gov.uk/leisure/archives/history/placeguide/SPGWolverhamptonTown.htm |title=Archive Gazetter – Wolverhampton |publisher=Staffordshire County Archives |access-date=23 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307073930/http://www.staffordshire.gov.uk/leisure/archives/history/placeguide/SPGWolverhamptonTown.htm |archive-date=7 March 2012  }}</ref> and the first meeting of the Council took place on 22 May 1848.<ref>Centenary of the Incorporation of the Borough of Wolverhampton, 1848 – 1948; County Borough of Wolverhampton; 1948; p.31</ref> The town was then made a [[County Borough]] in 1889 under the [[Local Government Act 1888]].<ref name=StaffsArchive/>

In 1933, the boundaries of the borough expanded, taking in areas from [[Cannock Rural District]] and [[Seisdon Rural District]], with very little of the surrounding urban area being affected,<ref name=avob>{{cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10136544&c_id=10001043 |title=Relationships / unit history of WOLVERHAMPTON |publisher=A Vision of Britain |access-date=15 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001011102/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10136544&c_id=10001043 |archive-date=1 October 2007  }}</ref> with only [[Heath Town]] Urban District being abolished.

The bulk of the [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]s of Bilston (a borough itself after 1933), [[Tettenhall]] and [[Wednesfield]] were added to the borough in 1966, along with the northern section of the urban district of [[Coseley]] and parts from the north of [[Sedgley]] and the west of [[Willenhall]].  The vast majority of these areas were traditionally part of the Parish of Wolverhampton, and were part of the original Parliamentary Borough.<ref name=avob/>

Wolverhampton was one of only two County Boroughs (the other being [[Liverpool]]) to have no changes made to the boundary during the [[Local Government Act 1972|1974 reorganisation of local government]], the borough already having a population larger than the 250,000 required for education authorities. This contrasted with both the [[Redcliffe-Maud Report]], and the initial White Paper for the 1974 reforms<ref name=white_paper>HMSO. ''Local Government in England: Government Proposals for Reorganisation''. Cmnd. 4584</ref> where large areas of the present [[South Staffordshire]] district were to be added to the borough. During the 1974 reforms it was placed within the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands Metropolitan County]].

Wolverhampton was also a [[Royal Peculiar]] covering a large area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stpetersguild.org.uk/thechurch.htm |title=The Church |publisher=St. Peter's Guild of Change Ringers |access-date=23 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830052520/http://www.stpetersguild.org.uk/thechurch.htm |archive-date=30 August 2008  }}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Partial view of the Mills of Thakurgaon Sugar Mills (6) (02.03.2019).jpg|thumb|Water-tube boiler made in Wolverhampton]]
Traditionally, Wolverhampton's economy has been dominated by iron, steel, [[automobiles]], engineering and manufacturing industries. Many of the traditional industries in the city have closed or dramatically downsized over the years. However, by 2008 the economy was dominated by the [[Tertiary sector of economic activity|service sector]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citymayors.com/culture/historic_weurope2.html#Anchor-United-60133 |title=Historic Cities in Western Europe |publisher=City Mayors |access-date=17 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724092500/http://www.citymayors.com/culture/historic_weurope2.html#Anchor-United-60133 |archive-date=24 July 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> with 74.9% of the city's employment being in this area. The major subcomponents of this sector are in public administration, education and health (32.8% of the total employment), while distribution, hotels and restaurants take up 21.1%, and finance and IT takes up 12.7%. The largest non-service industry was that of manufacturing (12.9%), whilst 5.2% of the total employment is related to the tourism industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/la/2038431971/printable.aspx|title=Nomis Official Labour Market Statistics 2008 Local Authority Profile: Wolverhampton|publisher=Office for National Statistics|access-date=15 December 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717101355/https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/la/2038431971/printable.aspx|archive-date=17 July 2011}}</ref>

===Jaguar Land Rover===
In 2014 [[Jaguar Land Rover]] opened a £500&nbsp;million [[Engine Manufacturing Centre|Engine Assembly Plant]] at the [[i54]] business park, Wolverhampton. Unveiled by [[Elizabeth II|Her Majesty]], the plant produces 2.0-litre 4-cylinder Ingenium diesel and petrol engines. Having already been expanded once before, in 2015 it was announced that the factory would be doubling in size to 200,000 sq m (2,152,782 sq ft), costing $450&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-34906608|title= New Jaguar Land Rover jobs in Wolverhampton factory expansion|author= BBC News|work= BBC News|date= 24 November 2015|access-date= 14 May 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161001105528/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-34906608|archive-date= 1 October 2016|url-status= live}}</ref> This expansion would see the workforce double from 700 to 1,400.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/business/business-news/jobs-boost-jaguar-land-rover-10492832|title=Jobs boost as Jaguar Land Rover doubles size of engine plant|author=Birmingham Post|date=11 November 2015|access-date=15 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414112844/http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/business/business-news/jobs-boost-jaguar-land-rover-10492832|archive-date=14 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Goodyear===

[[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] opened a large factory on Stafford Road, [[Fordhouses]], in 1927. However, it was decided in December 2003 that tyre production at the plant would be discontinued with the loss of more than 400 jobs. This came after some 2,000 job losses at the plant since 1997. The end of production came in 2004 but the factory remained open for tyre moulding and tractor tyre production.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/3339551.stm | work=BBC News | title=Job losses at Goodyear | date=22 December 2003}}</ref>

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===

The varied success of [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] since the club's formation in 1877 has also contributed to the economy of Wolverhampton. The club's greatest successes came between 1949 and 1960, when it won the league title three times and the [[FA Cup]] twice, as well as hosting a series of high-profile friendly matches against Europe's leading club sides, also competing in two early editions of the [[European Cup]]. During this era, Wolves frequently attracted crowds of between 40,000 and 50,000. Wolves went on to win the [[Football League Cup]] in 1974 and again in 1980, spending all but three seasons outside the top division of English football during the first 35 years of postwar league football, and continued to attract strong crowds but the 1980s saw a sharp decline in the club's fortunes, with three consecutive relegations, a sharp fall in attendances, and debts of more than £2million which almost put the club out of business. This decline also came at a time when the economy of Wolverhampton was struggling due to the [[early 1980s recession]]. Wolves enjoyed a surge in the late 1980s with two consecutive promotions, thanks largely to the prolific scoring of striker [[Steve Bull]], and an upturn in attendances which also provided a boost to the local economy – as did the club's increased support during the 1990s, during which time the stadium was extensively rebuilt and its facilities improved, with its new features including a restaurant and office space. In 2018, Wolves won promotion to the [[FA Premier League]] for the third time in 15 years, and a year later reached its first [[FA Cup]] semi-final since 1998, and further redevelopment of the stadium is planned.

===Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government ===

On 20 February 2021, it was announced as part of the government's levelling up strategy that The [[Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government]] (MHCLG), would be the first government department to have headquarters outside of London. It is expected that 500 posts including Senior Civil Servants would relocate to Wolverhampton by 2025.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/politics/2021/02/20/wolverhampton-chosen-for-new-government-department-headquarters/|title=First government department HQ outside London to be based in Wolverhampton|date=20 February 2021 |access-date=22 February 2021|archive-date=21 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210221222659/https://www.expressandstar.com/news/politics/2021/02/20/wolverhampton-chosen-for-new-government-department-headquarters/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Regeneration===
In recent years, Wolverhampton City Council have embarked on many city improvements and regeneration schemes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wolverhampton.gov.uk/business/regeneration/city_centre/ |title=City centre improvememnts |publisher=Wolverhampton City Council |date=13 July 2012 |access-date=24 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503163115/http://www.wolverhampton.gov.uk/business/regeneration/city_centre/ |archive-date=3 May 2012  }}</ref> One such project was "Summer Row", a new £300&nbsp;million retail quarter for Wolverhampton city centre. The project would have involved clearing existing buildings, and in 2006 a [[compulsory purchase order]] was issued to over 200 owner / occupiers in the surrounding area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tsrsurveyors.co.uk/news/COMPULSORY-PURCHASE.pdf |title=Towler Shaw Roberts, "Compulsory Purchase (or an Englishman's home is not his castle)" |access-date=24 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317164702/http://www.tsrsurveyors.co.uk/news/COMPULSORY-PURCHASE.pdf |archive-date=17 March 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Construction of Summer Row was originally earmarked for 2008, with a completion date listed as 2010,<ref>[http://www.summer-row.co.uk/scheme.aspx Summer Row official website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518001222/http://www.summer-row.co.uk/scheme.aspx |date=18 May 2009 }}</ref> but the 2008 recession put the project on hold.
In January 2011, the Summer Row project was formally cancelled<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2011/01/25/wolverhamptons-summer-row-dream-is-over/ |title=Wolverhampton's Summer Row dream is over |work=Express & Star |date=25 January 2011 |access-date=24 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927032719/http://www.expressandstar.com/news/2011/01/25/wolverhamptons-summer-row-dream-is-over/ |archive-date=27 September 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> as the CPO expired before the council found the necessary financial backing for the project.

====Mander Centre Redevelopment====

[[Debenhams]], who were listed as the anchor store of Summer Row, announced they were still keen in opening a department store in Wolverhampton. It was revealed they would open an anchor store in a £35&nbsp;million redevelopment of the [[Mander Centre]].

====Wolverhampton Interchange Project====

Wolverhampton's Interchange Project is a major redevelopment of the city's east side area worth around £120&nbsp;million.
[[File:Wolverhampton i10.JPG|thumb|The i10 building contains {{Convert|12400|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of leisure and retail space on the ground floor and {{Convert|36000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of office space above]]

* Phase 1, which was completed in 2012, consisted of demolishing the old bus station and replacing it with a new £22.5&nbsp;million station. This phase also included a new footbridge across the ring road towards the railway station, highway and pedestrian works, new offices for [[Transport for West Midlands|Centro]] and a [[Sainsbury's]] convenience store.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mowbraygill.co.uk/?p=262 |title=Wolverhampton – The Interchange |publisher=Mowbray Gill |access-date=12 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306003005/http://www.mowbraygill.co.uk/?p=262 |archive-date=6 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>
* Phase 2 which was completed in late 2015, involved the construction of the £10.6&nbsp;million i10 building adjacent to the new bus station. The building contains {{Convert|12400|sqft|m2}} of leisure and retail space on the ground floor and  {{Convert|36000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of office space above.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wolverhampton.gov.uk/article/3805/Interchange-project-moves-forward |title=Interchange project moves forward |publisher=City of Wolverhampton Council |access-date=12 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216105045/http://www.wolverhampton.gov.uk/article/3805/Interchange-project-moves-forward |archive-date=16 February 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>
* Phase 3 began in early 2016 on expanding the train station's [[multi-storey car park]]. Completed in December 2016, the car park increased in capacity from 450 to over 800 spaces.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2016/03/01/vision-revealed-as-multi-million-pound-wolverhampton-train-station-revamp-begins/ |title=Vision revealed as multi-million pound Wolverhampton train station revamp begins |newspaper=Express & Star |access-date=8 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309025659/http://www.expressandstar.com/news/2016/03/01/vision-revealed-as-multi-million-pound-wolverhampton-train-station-revamp-begins/ |archive-date=9 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> The expansion of the multi-storey car park will include a new cycle and motorcycle parking, short stay parking, passenger drop off point and a taxi rank adjacent to the car park.

* Phase 4 involved construction of a new development on the opposite side of Railway Drive to the i10 and is known as i9. The offices are used by the Department for Levelling Up, part of the National Government.

==Transport==

===Road===
Wolverhampton city centre forms the main focal point for the road network within the northwestern part of the [[West Midlands conurbation]], and out into the rural hinterland of [[Staffordshire]] and [[Shropshire]].  The road network within the boundaries of the city council area is entirely maintained by [[Wolverhampton City Council]], whilst those parts of the urban area outside the city council area have their networks maintained by [[Staffordshire County Council]], with the exception of [[M54 motorway|M54]] and [[A449 road|A449]] on the northern fringes of the urban area which are maintained by [[National Highways]].<ref name=highwaysagency>{{cite web |url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/our-road-network/our-network/network-map/ |title=Our Road Network |publisher=Highways Agency |access-date=27 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330064121/http://www.highways.gov.uk/our-road-network/our-network/network-map/ |archive-date=30 March 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Wolverhampton Ring Road.JPG|right|thumb|Wolverhampton's Ring Road]]
Major historical improvements to the city's road network include [[Thomas Telford]]'s Holyhead Road (now part of [[A41 road|A41]]), which was constructed between 1819 and 1826 to improve communications between London and [[Holyhead]], and hence to Ireland.  The majority of work within the city saw improvement to the contemporary network, though both the Wellington Road in [[Bilston]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wolverhampton.gov.uk/environment/land_premises/conservation/areas/Bilston+Town+Centre+Conservation+Area.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130113223908/http://www.wolverhampton.gov.uk/environment/land_premises/conservation/areas/Bilston+Town+Centre+Conservation+Area.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 January 2013 |title=Bilston Town Centre Conservation Area |publisher=Wolverhampton City Council |access-date=27 March 2013 }}</ref> and the cutting at the Rock near [[Tettenhall]] were newly constructed for the road, although the improvements at The Rock were constructed by the local Turnpike Trust rather than Telford himself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historywebsite.co.uk/listed/localist/TheRock.htm |title=The Rock, Tettenhall |publisher=Wolverhampton History and Heritage Society |access-date=27 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524035839/http://www.historywebsite.co.uk/listed/localist/TheRock.htm |archive-date=24 May 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1927, the [[A4123 road|A4123]] [[Birmingham]]-Wolverhampton New Road was constructed as both an unemployment relief project, and to relieve pressure on Telford's road through the [[Black Country]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sedgleymanor.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=topn&cat=0&pos=8 |title=Birmingham New Road circa 1927 |publisher=Sedgleymanor Photo Gallery |access-date=17 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111122704/http://www.sedgleymanor.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=topn&cat=0&pos=8 |archive-date=11 January 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was the first purpose built inter-city road in the United Kingdom within the 20th century,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lmars.co.uk/roadpix/a580/index.html |title=A580 East Lancashire Road |publisher=Lancashire Roads and Motorways Site |access-date=24 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070623230310/http://www.lmars.co.uk/roadpix/a580/index.html |archive-date=23 June 2007  }}</ref> and was said to be the longest stretch of new road in Britain since the [[Roman Empire|Romans]].

In 1960, plans were announced to build a [[Wolverhampton Ring Road|Ring Road]] around the centre of Wolverhampton. By the end of the 1960s, more than half of the Ring Road had been completed, stretching from Snow Hill to Stafford Street (via Penn Road, Chapel Ash and Waterloo Road), followed a few years later by a section between Snow Hill and Bilston Street. However, the final section between Bilston Street and Stafford Street (via Wednesfield Road) was not completed until 1986.  An outer ring road was also planned but only a small section was ever built, this being Wobaston Road in Pendeford.

[[File:M54Motorway2.jpg|right|thumb|The M54 motorway to the northwest of the city]]
Wolverhampton is near to several motorways, with four being located within {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} of the city centre.  The first to be constructed in the area was the [[M6 motorway|M6]], which opened in sections between 1966 and 1970,<ref name=tma>{{cite web |url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/openings.htm |title=Opening dates for Motorways in the UK in chronological order |publisher=The Motorway Archive |access-date=17 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202063942/http://www.iht.org/motorway/openings.htm |archive-date=2 December 2008  }}</ref> and connects the city with the north-west of England (including [[Manchester]] and [[Liverpool]]), Scotland as well as [[Birmingham]] and [[Coventry]] to the east, and London via the [[M1 motorway|M1]].  Together with the [[M5 motorway|M5]], which opened in the area in 1970<ref name=tma/> and links the city with the south-west of England, and London via the [[M40 motorway|M40]], the two motorways form a north–south bypass for the city.

The section of M6 motorway nearest to the city is one of the busiest within the UK,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.racfoundation.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=457&Itemid=35 |title=UK'S Congestion Hotspots Revealed |publisher=RAC Foundation |access-date=15 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827231304/http://www.racfoundation.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=457&Itemid=35 |archive-date=27 August 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> and to relieve congestion on this stretch, the [[M6 Toll]] which bypasses both the Wolverhampton and [[Birmingham]] sections of the M6 motorway was opened in 2003.<ref name=tma/>

The [[M54 motorway]] forms a northern bypass to the city, passing just within the fringes of the urban area, and links the city with [[Telford]], [[Shrewsbury]] and [[Wales]].  It opened in 1983.<ref name=tma/>

In addition to the motorways presently constructed, there have also been several proposed near to the city that have not been constructed, or have been constructed to a lower standard.  Included within these are the ''Bilston Link Motorway'', which was first proposed in the 1960s and was eventually constructed to a lower standard in the 1980s as the [[A454 road|A454]]/[[A463 road|A463]] [[Black Country Route]];{{citation needed|date=September 2024}} and the ''Western Orbital'' or ''Wolverhampton Western Bypass'', which was first proposed in the 1970s as a bypass for the western side of the city and the wider [[West Midlands conurbation]].{{citation needed|date=September 2024}} Currently proposed by the [[Highways Agency]] is the ''M54 to M6 / M6 (Toll) Link Road''. The route was initially proposed in the 2000s to relieve the overloaded sections of [[A460 road|A460]] and [[A449 road|A449]] near the city, and to replace a section of the cancelled Western Orbital.  Whilst it appears in the current roads programme, a date for the start of construction has not been set.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/11814.aspx |title=M54 to M6 / M6 (Toll) Link Road |publisher=Highways Agency |access-date=17 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730102600/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/11814.aspx |archive-date=30 July 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

===Rail===
Wolverhampton is well connected by rail to other parts of England and Wales. However, while Priestfield and Bilston are connected by a tram line, the suburbs in the south, west and north of Wolverhampton are no longer served by rail - in particular the Tettenhall, Penn and Compton areas and Dunstall Park for the race course. Wednesfield no longer has any rail connections, with {{rws|Wolverhampton}} and {{rws|Bloxwich}} being its closest railway stations.

Wolverhampton's first railway opened in 1837, with the opening of the [[Grand Junction Railway]], the first long-distance line in Great Britain.  The main station for the city was, however, not located in the city centre but at [[Wednesfield Heath railway station|Wednesfield Heath]], now [[Heath Town]] on the east side of the city.<ref name="Virgin Trains"/> This station was considered to be a First Class station, though its location was obviously not ideal and it became a goods station after passenger services ceased in 1873.  The station buildings were demolished in 1965, but the main station area is now a nature reserve just off Powell Street, called Station Fields and part of the edge of the northbound platform is still in situ. The track running through the station site is, however, still in use.<ref name="Heath Town Station"/>

The [[Wolverhampton Temporary railway station|first station in the city centre]] was opened by the [[Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway]] in 1849.  This station was only intended to be temporary and was located on the north side of Wednesfield Road, beside Broad Street Basin.  The station was constructed as the opening of [[Wolverhampton railway station|Wolverhampton High Level]] was delayed.  The station closed in 1852 and was demolished in the mid-1970s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historywebsite.co.uk/articles/railways/tmpsta.htmn.htm |title=Temporary Station |publisher=Wolverhampton History and Heritage Society |access-date=31 March 2013 }} {{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In addition to the temporary station, [[Wolverhampton Works]] were also established in 1849 by the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway and became the Northern Division workshop of the [[Great Western Railway]] in 1854.<ref name="manufacturing" />

The permanent station on the line finally opened on 24 June 1852 and was initially known as ''Wolverhampton General''; it was renamed as ''Wolverhampton Queen Street'' in 1853 and finally [[Wolverhampton railway station|Wolverhampton High Level]] in 1855.  The station was initially a joint station between the [[Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway]] and the [[London and North Western Railway]], though there were problems in the relationships between the two companies; the station became solely LNWR in 1854, before the [[Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway]] (later part of the [[Midland Railway]]) gained access to the station in 1867.  The original High Level station was demolished in 1965, as part of the electification of the [[West Coast Main Line]] and was replaced by buildings on the present site which have now been demolished.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historywebsite.co.uk/articles/railways/high%20level.htm |title=High Level Station |publisher=Wolverhampton History and Heritage Society |access-date=31 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524024930/http://www.historywebsite.co.uk/articles/railways/high%20level.htm |archive-date=24 May 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Two years after the opening of the High Level station, the [[Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway]] (OWW) opened their city centre station immediately to the east of High Level.  Initially called ''Wolverhampton Joint'', it was renamed [[Wolverhampton Low Level railway station|Wolverhampton Low Level]] in 1856. As well as the OWW, the station also served the [[Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Dudley Railway]] and the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway.  As the first two companies were supported by the [[Great Western Railway]], [[broad gauge]] track was laid to the station, meaning that Wolverhampton Low Level became the most northerly station on the broad gauge network before being converted to standard gauge in 1869.  Despite being featured in the second [[Beeching Report]], ''The Development of the Major Railway Trunk Routes'' in February 1965 as being on a line earmarked for further investment, services were withdrawn progressively from Low Level starting in 1967, soon after it had been transferred administratively from the [[Western Region of British Railways]] to the [[London Midland Region of British Railways|London Midland region]].  London services were transferred to the newly electrified High Level station.  Low Level was converted into a Parcels Concentration Depot in 1970 and the final passenger services were withdrawn in 1972.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historywebsite.co.uk/articles/railways/Low%20Level.htm |title=Low Level Station |publisher=Wolverhampton History and Heritage Society |access-date=31 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524031737/http://www.historywebsite.co.uk/articles/railways/Low%20Level.htm |archive-date=24 May 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> These services (to and from [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill]]) were only suspended and never legally withdrawn by [[British Rail]] and so technically the station is still open.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Regional News: Wolverhampton | journal = [[Rail (magazine)|Rail]] | date = 21 March – 3 April 2012 | first = Howard | last = Johnston | issue = 692 | page = 24}}</ref>

[[File:Dunstall Park station geograph-2516514-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dunstall Park railway station]] in 1958]]
There were also a number of suburban stations in Wolverhampton – including [[Dunstall Park railway station|Dunstall Park]] and [[Bushbury railway station|Bushbury]] north of the city centre; [[Tettenhall railway station|Tettenhall]] and [[Compton Halt railway station|Compton]] to the west side of the city on the GWR's [[Wombourne Branch Line]]; [[Wednesfield railway station|Wednesfield]] and [[Heath Town railway station|Heath Town]] on the [[Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway]]; [[Portobello railway station (Wolverhampton)|Portobello]] on the [[Walsall to Wolverhampton Line]]; [[Priestfield railway station|Priestfield]] and [[Bilston Central railway station|Bilston Central]] on the [[Birmingham Snow Hill to Wolverhampton Low Level Line]]; and [[Bilston West railway station|Bilston West]] and [[Daisy Bank railway station|Daisy Bank]] on the [[Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway|Oxford-Worcester-Wolverhampton Line]].  Today, all of the suburban rail stations within the city have been closed, although [[Coseley railway station|Coseley]], [[Codsall railway station|Codsall]] and [[Bilbrook railway station|Bilbrook]] are just outside the boundaries. Also, some of the seven West Midlands Metro tram stations in the city are near or directly replace these former suburban stations.

The former High Level station, now simply known as [[Wolverhampton railway station|Wolverhampton station]], is today one of the principal stations on the [[West Coast Main Line]]. It has regular rail services to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]], [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street]] and [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester Piccadilly]], as well as most other major cities in the UK. In addition to the long-distance services, there are many local services including those on the [[Cambrian Line]] into [[Wales]], the [[Walsall to Wolverhampton Line]] to [[Walsall railway station|Walsall]], the [[Wolverhampton to Shrewsbury Line]] to [[Telford Central railway station|Telford]] and [[Shrewsbury railway station|Shrewsbury]]; and the [[Rugby-Birmingham-Stafford Line]] to [[Stafford railway station|Stafford]] and [[Coventry railway station|Coventry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/ldbboard/dep/WVH |title=Live Departures – Wolverhampton |publisher=National Rail Enquiries |access-date=31 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405060907/http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/ldbboard/dep/WVH |archive-date=5 April 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/WVH/details.html |title=Wolverhampton (WVH) |publisher=National Rail Enquiries |access-date=31 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402052800/http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/WVH/details.html |archive-date=2 April 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The 1960s buildings of the station have now been demolished, following a lengthy delay, and are being replaced with a more modern station building. Phase 1 opened in spring 2020, which saw the creation of a new entrance. Phase 2 saw the demolition of the remainder but construction of the replacement was delayed due to the COVID-19 restrictions and opened on 28 June 2021.<ref>{{cite web |title=New-look Wolverhampton Station formally opens |url=https://www.westmidlandsrailway.co.uk/about-us/news-desk/new-look-wolverhampton-station-formally-opens |website=West Midlands Railway |access-date=23 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210630100424/https://www.westmidlandsrailway.co.uk/about-us/news-desk/new-look-wolverhampton-station-formally-opens |archive-date=30 June 2021 |date=28 June 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> This new station includes a stop on the Metro tram line which opened in September 2023.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lawson |first1=Eleanor |date=17 September 2023 |title=At last!

===Buses===
{{see also|Wolverhampton bus station}}
Buses in the city are run by a number of bus operators, the largest provider of services is [[National Express West Midlands]]. As well as serving suburbs of the city, buses from the centre of Wolverhampton also provide a direct link with the city of [[Birmingham]] and connections to [[Walsall]], [[Telford]], [[West Bromwich]], [[Stourbridge]], [[Cannock]], [[Stafford]], [[Sedgley]], [[Bilston]], [[Bloxwich]], [[Bridgnorth]] and [[Dudley]].

[[Wolverhampton bus station]] operated by [[Transport for West Midlands]] is situated at Pipers Row, near to the railway station, providing an interchange between the three modes of transport (bus, train and tram). The station has recently had a complete rebuild. Its previous Pipers Row incarnation opened on 26 October 1986, just six years after its predecessor of 1981.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wulfrun |first=Lady |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/8050359@N07/2497493714/ |title=Wolverhampton's second, but short-lived Bus Station (off Railway Drive), 1981. &#124; Flickr – Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date=20 January 2012 |access-date=24 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322184245/http://www.flickr.com/photos/8050359@N07/2497493714/ |archive-date=22 March 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> The station underwent a further upgrade in 1990, which saw the grade II listed [[Queen's Building, Wolverhampton|Queen's Building]] incorporated into the bus station. A mild refurbishment took place in 2005/06, with new toilets and the addition of a coach stand. Operators are charged a departure fee to contribute towards the upkeep of the station.

In July 2009, plans were unveiled for a complete rebuild of the bus station, which was part of Wolverhampton's Interchange Project. The bus station closed in April 2010 and was demolished; a £22.5&nbsp;million station opened in July 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2011/06/21/glowing-future-for-wolverhampton-bus-station/ |title=Glowing future for Wolverhampton bus station |work=Express & Star |date=21 June 2011 |access-date=24 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929215734/http://www.expressandstar.com/news/2011/06/21/glowing-future-for-wolverhampton-bus-station/ |archive-date=29 September 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Colour schemes and branding have been updated over the years, for example the transition from [[Transport for West Midlands|Network West Midlands]] to TfWM branding.

Most bus services are currently operated by [[National Express West Midlands]] and [[Diamond West Midlands|Diamond Bus]], however a small number are operated by [[Travel Express]], Banga Bus and one [[Arriva Midlands|Arriva]] service to Bridgnorth. Due to the quantity of National Express services, the company has a traffic office inside the bus station where traffic officers can monitor disruptions and make alterations if required.

The West Midlands Metro, a [[light rail]] system, currently connects [[Wolverhampton St George's tram stop|Wolverhampton St George's]] to [[Grand Central tram stop]] via [[West Bromwich]] and [[Wednesbury]], mostly following the former [[Birmingham Snow Hill-Wolverhampton Low Level Line]]. There were plans for further lines within the city, with both a city centre loop and a line to [[Walsall]] via [[Wednesfield]] and [[Willenhall]], mostly following the route of the closed [[Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway]], however, these were cancelled in late 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centro.org.uk/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.asp?lID=1826&sID=4319 |title=The 5Ws Route |publisher=Centro |format=PDF |access-date=17 June 2008 }} {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

This new line will extend the existing line from Wolverhampton Interchange to the hospital, via an old railway line. Another planned but not confirmed extension is from St Georges to the i54.

===Air===
Wolverhampton's original airport was at [[Pendeford]], opened in 1938 and closed on 31 December 1970.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/articles/Pendeford/Airport.htm |title=The Airport and Boulton Paul |work=The History of Pendeford |publisher=Wolverhampton History & Heritage Society |author=Phil Clayton |date=February 2004 |access-date=17 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819042519/http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/articles/Pendeford/Airport.htm |archive-date=19 August 2008  }}</ref> The current [[Wolverhampton Airport]], renamed from Halfpenny Green, is a small general aviation airfield located {{convert|8|mi|km|1}} southwest of the city. Expansion of the airport has been suggested, but the current owners want to keep it as a General Aviation airfield. The airport hosts various "fly in" events and is an original World War Two airfield.

The nearest major airport is [[Birmingham Airport]], approximately {{convert|25|mi|km|1}} away. The airport is easy to reach by train, with a direct express service to it only taking on average 36 minutes. By car, it takes approximately 45 minutes via the M6 or M6 Toll Road.

===Waterways===
{{main|Birmingham Canal Navigations}}
There are no navigable rivers within the city, but there are {{convert|17|mi|km|abbr=on}} of navigable canals. The [[BCN Main Line|Birmingham Canal Main Line]] passes through the city centre, connecting with the remaining portion of the [[Wednesbury Oak Loop]] at Deepfields Junction, and the [[Wyrley & Essington Canal]] at [[Horseley Fields Junction]], before passing between [[Wolverhampton railway station|the railway station]] and [[Wolverhampton bus station|the bus station]] in the city centre and then descending {{Convert|132|ft|m}} through the 21 Wolverhampton Locks and terminating at [[Aldersley Junction]] where it meets the [[Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal]], which in turn connects with the [[Shropshire Union Canal]] at [[Autherley Junction]].<ref>[[Nicholson Guides|Nicholson Waterways Guide]], Volume 2 (2006), HarperCollins Publishing Ltd, {{ISBN|0-00-721110-4}}</ref>

===Cycling===
Most places in the borough and some of the neighbouring villages in South Staffordshire are within easy reach of the city centre by pedal cycle and terrain is moderately hilly. Climbs tend to be of two to three minutes duration. Cycling benefits from the {{convert|20|mph|km/h|0}} city centre within the Ring Road and a number of routes that use quieter roads and paths to avoid the ten 'A' roads that radiate from the Ring Road. Wolverhampton is on the Smethwick to Telford section of [[Sustrans]] [[National Cycle Network]] Route 81.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sustrans.org.uk/default.asp?sID=1099911816156 |title=strans Route 81 |publisher=Sustrans |access-date=24 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114075757/http://www.sustrans.org.uk/default.asp?sID=1099911816156 |archive-date=14 January 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> This follows the [[BCN Main Line|Birmingham Main Line Canal]] towpath from [[Smethwick]] to Broad Street Basin, Wolverhampton where the route splits in two.

===Football===
Wolverhampton is represented in the [[Premier League]], the highest tier of English football, by [[Wolverhampton Wanderers FC]]. 'Wolves', as they are known, are one of the oldest English football clubs, and were one of the 12 founder members of the [[Football League]]. Their most successful period was the 1950s, where they won three Football League Championships (then the highest division) and two [[FA Cup]]s, and were involved in the earliest European friendlies. They were hailed by the press as 'The Unofficial World Champions' after one of their most famous victories, against [[Budapest Honvéd FC]] of Hungary. They were also the first English team to play in the Soviet Union. These victories instigated the birth of the European Cup competition which later evolved into the UEFA Champions' League (see [[European Cup and Champions League history]]).

In total, they have won three Football League titles (prior to the top division becoming the [[Premier League]]), four FA Cups, have two [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] victories and many other minor honours, including reaching the [[UEFA Cup]] Final in 1972, and appearances in the last eight of both the [[UEFA Champions League|UEFA European Cup]], and the European [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]], but spent just one season in the top division between 1984 and 2009.  They are also one of only two clubs, along with [[Portsmouth FC|Portsmouth]], to have won five different league titles; they have championed all four tiers of the professional English league, as well as the long-defunct northern section of the Third Division.

Wolves have a long-established [[Black Country derby|rivalry]] with [[West Bromwich Albion]]. Separated by {{convert|12|mi|km|abbr=on}}, the two clubs have faced each other over 160 times since 1886.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/head_to_head.sd?team_id=2744&team2_id=2848|title=Head to head West Brom vs. Wolves|author=soccerbase|access-date=15 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123031528/http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/head_to_head.sd?team_id=2744&team2_id=2848|archive-date=23 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Aston Villa]] and [[Birmingham City FC]] are also close rivals of Wolves, having played them 121<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/head_to_head.sd?team_id=2848&team2_id=154|title=Head to head Wolves vs. Aston Villa|author=soccerbase|access-date=15 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224120616/http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/head_to_head.sd?team_id=2848&team2_id=154|archive-date=24 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> and 136<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/head_to_head.sd?team_id=2848&team2_id=291|title=Head to head Wolves vs. Birmingham|author=soccerbase|access-date=15 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224115739/http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/head_to_head.sd?team_id=2848&team2_id=291|archive-date=24 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> times respectively.
