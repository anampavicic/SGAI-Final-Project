==History==
{{main|Maritime history of Somalia}}
The ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' indicates that [[Ancient Greek]] merchants sailed to Bosaso, providing notes about the strategic and geographical location of the current Bosaso area, which was known as '''[[Mosylon]]''' in ancient times. <blockquote>About {{frac|3|1|2}} hours' walk from Bet Qasim, we came to Bander Kasin (also called by the Arabs: the native name is Bosaso), which was built about sixty years ago. The [[Kaptallah]] was considered as first settlers. <ref>{{Cite web |title=Internet History Sourcebooks Project: Ancient History |url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/ancient/periplus.asp |access-date=2024-01-24 |website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu}}</ref>{{fv|date=January 2024|reason=quote not in source}}</blockquote>

Bosaso's population is estimated at 700,000 residents. It is the third largest city in Somalia after Mogadishu and [[Hargeisa]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Bosaso, Somalia|year=2014|url=https://www.minneapolis.org/about-us/sister-cities/bosaso-somalia/| language=en-US}}</ref> While Bosaso is a melting pot, with residents hailing from all the major clans of [[Somalia]], most of its population is from the [[Harti]] confederation of [[Darod]] sub-clans.<ref name=":0"/>

Bosaso was previously known as Bandar Qasim, a name derived from a local trader of the same name who is said to have first settled in the area during the 14th century. It is believed that Qasim's favourite [[camel]] was called Boosaas, from which derived the current name of the town. The town was thus first called Bandar Qassim after its founder ("Qasim's town"), then later dubbed Bosaso after its founder's trusted camel. Historically, Bosaso has been a [[Harti]] stronghold, and evolved as a coastal town.<ref>{{cite web |title=Historical Background |url=http://biyokulule.com/Bosaso_history.htm |website=Biyokulule |access-date=Jan 19, 2024}}</ref>

In June 2014, the Puntland government launched a new tree-planting campaign in the state, with the regional Ministry of Environment, Wildlife and Tourism slated to plant 25,000 trees by the end of the year. Bosaso is among the seven cities and towns earmarked for the reforestation initiative, which also include [[Garowe]], [[Qardho]], [[Dhahar]], [[Buuhoodle]], [[Buraan|Baran]] and [[Galkayo]]. The campaign is part of a broader partnership between the Puntland authorities and EU to set up various environmental protection measures in the region, with the aim of promoting reforestation and afforestation.<ref name="Gswedcipgcftp">{{cite news|title=Somalia: World Environment Day celebrated in Puntland, Govt calls for tree plantation|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia-World-Environment-Day-celebrated-in-Puntland-Govt-calls-for-tree-plantation_printer.shtml|access-date=6 June 2014|agency=Garowe Online|date=5 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606220447/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia-World-Environment-Day-celebrated-in-Puntland-Govt-calls-for-tree-plantation_printer.shtml|archive-date=6 June 2014}}</ref>

==Economy==
Bosaso is a city that is experiencing rapid growth. Prior to the Somali civil war, it had a population of under 50,000 inhabitants. Since the conflict, Somalis belonging to the Harti Darod sub-clans began migrating back to their ancestral areas of [[Puntland]].<ref name="GARW">{{cite web |url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Editorial_29/Somalia_President_Farole_the_Pride_of_Puntland_Editorial.shtml |title=President Farole - the Pride of Puntland |publisher=Garoweonline.com |date=2010-05-12 |access-date=2010-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619122328/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Editorial_29/Somalia_President_Farole_the_Pride_of_Puntland_Editorial.shtml |archive-date=2010-06-19 }}</ref> As a consequence of these migrations, Bosaso's population and the local housing industry have grown tremendously.
