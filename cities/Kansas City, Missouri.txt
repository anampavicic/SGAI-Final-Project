Confusion between the two ensued, and the name Kansas City was assigned to distinguish them soon after.

Sitting on Missouri's western boundary with [[Kansas]], with [[Downtown Kansas City|Downtown]] near the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, the city encompasses about {{convert|319.03|sqmi|km2}}, making it the [[List of United States cities by area|25th largest city by total area]] in the United States.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Kansas City metropolitan area}}
{{For timeline}}
The town of [[town of Kansas|Kansas, Missouri]], was incorporated on June 1, 1850, reincorporated and renamed City of Kansas on March 28, 1853, and renamed Kansas City in 1889. The [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area|area]] straddles the border between Missouri and Kansas at the [[Kaw Point|confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers]], and was considered a good place settle.

The [[Antioch Christian Church (Kansas City, Missouri)|Antioch Christian Church]], [[Dr. James Compton House]], and [[Woodneath]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name="nris">{{NRISref|version=2010a|dateform=mdy}}</ref>

===Exploration and settlement===
[[File:Westport Pioneers Statue.jpg|thumb|The Kansas City Pioneer Square monument in Westport features [[Pony Express]] founder [[Alexander Majors]], Westport and Kansas City founder [[John Calvin McCoy]], and [[mountain man]] [[Jim Bridger]] who owned Chouteau's Store.]]
In past centuries, the area's tribal inhabitants include the [[Hopewell tradition]], [[Mississippian culture]], [[Kaw people|Kansa]], [[Osage Nation|Osage]], [[Otoe]], and [[Missouria|Missouri]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.visitkc.com/visitors/things-do/trip-ideas-tools/discover/diversity/native-american-culture-kansas-city |title=Native American Culture in Kansas City |website=VisitKC.com |access-date=February 8, 2023 |archive-date=February 5, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230205020759/https://www.visitkc.com/visitors/things-do/trip-ideas-tools/discover/diversity/native-american-culture-kansas-city |url-status=live }}</ref> The first documented European visitor to the eventual site of Kansas City was [[Étienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont]], who was also the first European to explore the lower Missouri River. Criticized for his response to the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] attack on [[Fort Détroit]], he had deserted his post as fort commander and was avoiding French authorities. Bourgmont lived with a Native American wife in a village about {{convert|90|mi|km}} east near [[Brunswick, Missouri]], where he illegally traded [[furs]].

To clear his name, he wrote ''Exact Description of Louisiana, of Its Harbors, Lands and Rivers, and Names of the Indian Tribes That Occupy It, and the Commerce and Advantages to Be Derived Therefrom for the Establishment of a Colony'' in 1713 and ''The Route to Be Taken to Ascend the Missouri River'' in 1714. In the documents, he describes the junction of the "Grande Riv[ière] des Cansez" and Missouri River, as the first adoption of those names. French cartographer [[Guillaume Delisle]] used the descriptions to make the area's first reasonably accurate map.

The [[Kingdom of Spain|Spanish]] took over the region in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, but were not to play a major role other than taxing and licensing Missouri River ship traffic. The French continued their [[fur trade]] under Spanish license. The [[Chouteau]] family operated under Spanish license at [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], in the lower [[Missouri River Valley|Missouri Valley]] as early as 1765 and in 1821 the Chouteaus reached Kansas City, where [[François Chouteau]] established Chouteau's Landing.

===After the Louisiana Purchase (1803)===
{{see also|Bleeding Kansas|History of slavery in Missouri}}
[[File:Kansas City in 1843, drawing from Centennial History of Oregon.png|thumb|In 1843, Kansas City was depicted in a history of [[Oregon]].]]
After the 1803 [[Louisiana Purchase]], [[Lewis and Clark]] visited the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers, noting it was a good place to build a fort. In 1831, a group of [[Mormons]] from [[New York state]] led by [[Joseph Smith]] settled in the area. They built the first school within what became Kansas City, but were forced out by [[mob violence]] in 1833.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wilkinson |first=Ernest L. |title=Brigham Young University: The First 100 Years |location=Provo |publisher=BYU Press |year=1976 |volume=1 |page=7 }}</ref>

In 1831, Gabriel Prudhomme Sr., a Canadian trapper and partner of [[François Chouteau]], purchased {{convert|257|acres}} fronting the Missouri River.  He established a home for his wife, Josephine, and six children. He operated a ferry on the river.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

In 1833, [[John Calvin McCoy|John McCoy]], son of [[Baptist]] [[missionary]] [[Isaac McCoy]] and brother-in-law of [[Johnston Lykins]], established [[Westport, Kansas City|West Port]] along the [[Santa Fe Trail]], {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=off|adj=off|sp=us}} south of the river. In 1834, McCoy established Westport Landing on a bend in the Missouri to serve as a landing point for West Port, with Lykins as the first postmaster. He found it more convenient to have his goods offloaded at the Prudhomme landing next to Chouteau's landing than in Independence.  Several years after Gabriel Prudhomme's death, a group of fourteen investors purchased his land at auction on November 14, 1838. By 1839, the investors divided the property and the first lots were sold in 1846 after legal complications were settled. The remaining lots were sold by February 1850.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

In 1850, the landing area was incorporated as the town of [[town of Kansas|Kansas, Missouri]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Why is Kansas City located in Missouri instead of Kansas? | url=http://www.kclibrary.org/kchistory/why-kansas-city-located-missouri-instead-kansas | access-date=January 2, 2010 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716232838/http://www.kclibrary.org/kchistory/why-kansas-city-located-missouri-instead-kansas | archive-date=July 16, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> By that time, the towns of Kansas, Westport, and nearby [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], had become critical points in the [[Territorial acquisitions of the United States|westward expansion]] of the United States. Three major [[Historical roads and trails of the United States|trail]]s – the [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]], [[California Trail|California]], and [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]] – all passed through Jackson County.

On February 22, 1853, Kansas was reincorporated and renamed the City of Kansas with its first elected mayor, [[William Samuel Gregory]]. Due to a legal discovery of living outside city boundaries, he was soon succeeded by Johnston Lykins as the second (but first legally elected) mayor.<ref name="KC Mayors">{{cite book | title=A Condensed History of the Kansas City Area: Its Mayors and Some V.I.P.s | last=Green | first=George Fuller | publisher=The Lowell Press | date=1968 | location=[[Kansas City, Missouri]] | oclc=1144606867}}</ref><ref name="Lykins KCH">{{cite web | title=Johnston Lykins | work=Missouri Valley Special Collections | publisher=[[Kansas City Public Library]] | url= https://kchistory.org/document/biography-johnston-lykins-1800-1876-missionary-doctor-and-kansas-citys-second-mayor | first=Daniel | last=Coleman | access-date=March 31, 2022}}</ref> The city had an area of {{convert|0.70|sqmi|km2}} and a population of 2,500.

===American Civil War===
{{Further|American Civil War}}
During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the city and its immediate surroundings were the focus of intense military activity. Although the [[First Battle of Independence]] in August 1862 resulted in a [[Confederate States Army]] victory, the Confederates were unable to leverage their win in any significant fashion, as Kansas City was occupied by Union troops and proved too heavily fortified to assault. The [[Second Battle of Independence]], which occurred on October 21–22, 1864, as part of [[Sterling Price]]'s [[Price's Raid|Missouri expedition of 1864]], also resulted in a Confederate triumph. Once again their victory proved hollow, as Price was decisively defeated in the pivotal [[Battle of Westport]] the next day, effectively ending Confederate efforts to regain Missouri.

General [[Thomas Ewing, Jr.|Thomas Ewing]], in response to a successful raid on nearby [[Lawrence, Kansas]], led by [[William Quantrill]], issued [[General Order No. 11 (1863)|General Order No. 11]], forcing the eviction of residents in four western Missouri counties – including Jackson – except those living in the city and nearby communities and those whose allegiance to the Union was certified by Ewing.

===After Civil War===
[[File:Junction of Main and Delaware Streets, Kansas City, Mo (NYPL b12647398-68704).tiff|thumb|The junction of Main and Delaware Streets in 1898]]
After the Civil War, Kansas City grew rapidly. The selection of the city over [[Leavenworth, Kansas]], for the [[Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad]] bridge over the [[Missouri River]] brought significant growth. The population exploding after 1869, when Hannibal Bridge, designed by [[Octave Chanute]], opened. The boom prompted a name change to Kansas City in 1889, and the city limits to be extended south and east. Westport became part of Kansas City on December 2, 1897. In 1900, Kansas City was the 22nd largest city in the country, with a population of 163,752 residents.<ref name="U.S. Census Bureau">{{cite web|title=Missouri – Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |access-date=December 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archive-date=August 12, 2012 }}</ref>

The obsolescence of [[Kansas City Union Station#Union Depot era|Union Depot]] in West Bottoms in favor of the new [[Kansas City Union Station|Union Station]] in 1914, and the opening of the [[Liberty Memorial]] in 1923, provided two of the city's most identifiable landmarks. [[Robert A. Long]], president of the Liberty Memorial Association, was a driving force in the funding for construction. Long was a longtime resident and wealthy businessman. He built the [[R.A. Long Building]] for the [[Long-Bell Lumber Company]], his home, [[Kansas City Museum|Corinthian Hall]] (now the [[Kansas City Museum]]) and [[Longview Farm]].{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

Further spurring Kansas City's growth was the opening of the innovative [[Country Club Plaza]] development by [[Jesse Clyde Nichols|J.C. Nichols]] in 1925, as part of his [[Country Club District]] plan.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

===Pendergast era===
At the start of the 20th century, [[political machines]] gained clout in the city, with the one led by [[Tom Pendergast]] dominating the city by 1925. Several important buildings and structures were built during this time, including the [[Kansas City City Hall]] and the Jackson County Courthouse. During this time, he aided one of his nephew's friends, [[Harry S. Truman]], in a political career. Truman eventually became a senator, then vice president, then [[Presidency of Harry S. Truman|president]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Taylor |first1=Jon |title=Harry Truman and the Pendergast Political Machine |url=https://pendergastkc.org/article/harry-truman-and-pendergast-political-machine |website=pendergastkc |date=June 16, 2017 |publisher=Kansas City Public Library |access-date=August 31, 2021 |archive-date=October 10, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211010214303/https://pendergastkc.org/article/harry-truman-and-pendergast-political-machine |url-status=live }}</ref> The machine fell in 1939 when Pendergast, riddled with health problems, pleaded guilty to tax evasion after long federal investigations. His biographers have summed up his uniqueness:

{{blockquote|Pendergast may bear comparison to various big-city bosses, but his open alliance with hardened criminals, his cynical subversion of the democratic process, his monarchistic style of living, his increasingly insatiable gambling habit, his grasping for a business empire, and his promotion of Kansas City as a wide-open town with every kind of vice imaginable, combined with his professed compassion for the poor and very real role as city builder, made him bigger than life, difficult to characterize.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lawrence H.

====Troost redlining and white flight====
[[Troost Avenue]] was once the eastern edge of Kansas City, Missouri and a residential corridor nicknamed Millionaire Row. It is now widely seen as one of the city's most prominent racial and economic dividing lines due to urban decay, which was caused by [[white flight]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://info.umkc.edu/unews/troost-wall-the-product-of-kansas-citys-long-running-racial-plight/|title='Troost Wall' the product of Kansas City's long-running racial plight: Racist real estate practices leave urban decay – University News|website=info.umkc.edu|date=March 5, 2013 |access-date=November 18, 2019|archive-date=May 5, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210505031259/https://info.umkc.edu/unews/troost-wall-the-product-of-kansas-citys-long-running-racial-plight/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kcur.org/community/2014-03-27/how-troost-became-a-major-divide-in-kansas-city|title=How Troost Became a Major Divide in Kansas City|date=March 27, 2014 |publisher=KCUR 89.3 – NPR in Kansas City|access-date=April 19, 2020|archive-date=May 5, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210505063331/https://www.kcur.org/community/2014-03-27/how-troost-became-a-major-divide-in-kansas-city|url-status=live}}</ref> During the civil rights era the city blocked people of color from moving to homes west of Troost Avenue, causing the areas east of Troost to have one of the worst murder rates in the country.

In 1940, the city had about 400,000 residents; by 2000, it had about 440,000. From 1940 to 1960, the city more than doubled its physical size, while increasing its population by only about 75,000. By 1970, the city covered approximately {{convert|316|sqmi|km2}}, more than five times its size in 1940.{{Citation needed|date=February 2023}} Aggressively annexing the surrounding suburbs and undeveloped land spared Kansas City from the severe population loss suffered by cities like St. Louis and Detroit, similar cities which both lost over 50% of their population in the postwar era. In the most neglected neighborhoods, however, the same pattern of abandonment occurred and left behind massive numbers of vacant lots and abandoned homes, especially in the areas east of Troost.

In the 21st century, the Kansas City area has undergone extensive redevelopment, with more than $6 billion in improvements to the downtown area on the Missouri side. One of the main goals is to attract convention and tourist dollars, office workers, and residents to downtown KCMO. Among the projects include the redevelopment of the [[Power & Light District]] into a retail and entertainment district; and the Sprint Center, an 18,500-seat arena that opened in 2007, funded by a 2004 ballot initiative involving a tax on car rentals and hotels, designed to meet the stadium specifications for a possible future NBA or NHL franchise,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/stories/2004/08/02/daily19.html|title=Voter OK of arena tax 'changes everything'|work=Kansas City Business Journal|access-date=March 30, 2018|archive-date=March 7, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210307203144/https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/stories/2004/08/02/daily19.html|url-status=live}}</ref> and was renamed [[T-Mobile Center]] in 2020; Kemper Arena, which was functionally superseded by Sprint Center, fell into disrepair and was sold to private developers.

From 2007 to 2017, downtown residential population in Kansas City quadrupled and continues to grow. The area has grown from almost 4,000 residents in the early 2000s to nearly 30,000 {{as of|2017|lc=yes}}. Kansas City's downtown ranks as the sixth-fastest-growing downtown in America with the population expected to grow by more than 40% by 2022. Conversions of office buildings such as the Power & Light Building and the Commerce Bank Tower into residential and hotel space has helped to fulfill the demand. New apartment complexes like One, Two, and Three Lights, River Market West, and 503 Main have begun to reshape Kansas City's skyline. Strong demand has led to occupancy rates in the upper 90%.<ref name="kansascity">{{Cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/business/development/article84819842.html|title=Three projects are part of a surge in downtown KC apartments|work=kansascity.com|access-date=November 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201104733/http://www.kansascity.com/news/business/development/article84819842.html|archive-date=December 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

The residential population of downtown has boomed, and the office population has dropped significantly from the early 2000s to the mid-2010s. Top employers like AMC moved their operations to modern office buildings in the suburbs. High office vacancy plagued downtown, leading to the neglect of many office buildings. By the mid-2010s, many office buildings were converted to residential uses and the Class A vacancy rate plunged to 12% in 2017. Swiss Re, Virgin Mobile, AutoAlert, and others have begun to move operations to downtown Kansas City from the suburbs and expensive coastal cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2017/10/25/swiss-re-office-kansas-city-move.html|title=Missouri writes up $20M to lure 400-employee insurer across state line|work=Kansas City Business Journal|access-date=September 30, 2018|archive-date=March 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308031734/https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2017/10/25/swiss-re-office-kansas-city-move.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://kceconomy.org/2017/10/05/source-of-metro-employment-growth-shifting-east/|title=Source of Metro Employment Growth Shifting East?|date=October 5, 2017|website=Kceconomy.org|access-date=November 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201041614/https://kceconomy.org/2017/10/05/source-of-metro-employment-growth-shifting-east/|archive-date=December 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

The area has seen additional development through various transportation projects, including improvements to the [[Grandview Triangle]], which intersects Interstates 435 and 470, and [[U.S. Route 71 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 71]].

In July 2005, the [[Kansas City Area Transportation Authority]] (KCATA) launched Kansas City's first [[bus rapid transit]] line, the [[Metro Area Express]] (MAX), which links the River Market, Downtown, Union Station, Crown Center and the Country Club Plaza. The KCATA continues to expand MAX with additional routes on Prospect Avenue, Troost Avenue, and Independence Avenue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kcata.org/transit-initiatives/prospect_max|title=Prospect MAX {{!}} Transit Initiatives|publisher=KCATA|access-date=November 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112190613/http://www.kcata.org/transit-initiatives/prospect_max|archive-date=November 12, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2013, construction began on a two-mile [[KC Streetcar|streetcar]] line in downtown Kansas City (funded by a $102 million ballot initiative that was passed in 2012) that runs between the River Market and Union Station, it began operation in May 2016. In 2017, voters approved the formation of a TDD to expand the streetcar line south 3.5 miles from Union Station to UMKC's Volker Campus. Additionally in 2017, the KC Port Authority began engineering studies for a Port Authority funded streetcar expansion north to Berkley Riverfront Park. Citywide, voter support for rail projects continues to grow with numerous light rail projects in the works.<ref>{{cite news |last=Morris |first=Mark |url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article334693/Missouri-Supreme-Court-all-but-ends-battle-over-KC-streetcar-financing.html |title=Missouri Supreme Court all but ends battle over KC streetcar financing |newspaper=[[The Kansas City Star]] |date=December 24, 2013 |access-date=July 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806194804/http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article334693/Missouri-Supreme-Court-all-but-ends-battle-over-KC-streetcar-financing.html |archive-date=August 6, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kcrta.org/streetcar/|title=Midtown/UMKC Streetcar Extension Resources|publisher=KCRTA|access-date=November 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201044055/http://kcrta.org/streetcar/|archive-date=December 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2016, Jackson County, Missouri, acquired unused rail lines as part of a long-term commuter rail plan. For the time being, the line is being converted to a trail while county officials negotiate with railroads for access to tracks in Downtown Kansas City.

On November 7, 2017, Kansas City voters overwhelmingly approved a new single terminal at [[Kansas City International Airport]] by a 75% to 25% margin. The new single terminal replaced the three existing "Clover Leafs" at KCI Airport on February 28, 2023.

Kansas City proper is bowl-shaped and is surrounded to the north and south by [[glacier]]-carved [[limestone]] and [[bedrock]] cliffs. Kansas City is at the confluence between the Dakota and Minnesota ice lobes during the maximum late Independence glaciation of the [[Pleistocene]] [[Geologic time scale|epoch]]. The Kansas and Missouri rivers cut wide valleys into the terrain when the glaciers melted and drained. A partially filled spillway valley crosses the central city. This valley is an eastward continuation of the Turkey Creek Valley. It is the closest major city to the geographic center of the contiguous United States, or "Lower 48".

The Historic Kansas City boundary is roughly {{convert|58|sqmi|km2}} and has a population density of about {{Convert|5,000|PD/sqmi}}. It runs from the Missouri River to the north, 79th Street to the south, the Blue River to the east, and State Line Road to the west. During the 1960s and 1970s, Kansas City annexed large amounts of land, which are largely undeveloped.

Between the 2000 and 2010 census counts, the urban core of Kansas City continued to drop significantly in population. The areas of Greater Downtown in the center city, and sections near I-435 and I-470 in the south, and Highway 152 in the north are the only areas of Kansas City, Missouri, to have an increase in population, with the Northland population growing the most.<ref>{{cite web|title=2000–2010 Population Change Map |url=http://marc.org/gis/assets/2010Census/Tracts_population_change_dotdensity.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603055112/http://marc.org/gis/assets/2010Census/Tracts_population_change_dotdensity.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 3, 2011 |publisher=Mid-America Regional Council |access-date=September 2, 2013 }}</ref> Even so, the population of Kansas City as a whole from 2000 to 2010 increased by 4.1%.

Theater troupes in the 1870s toured the state, performing in cities or small towns forming along the railroad lines. Rail transport had enhanced the theater troupe tour market, by allowing full costumes, props, and sets. As theater grew in popularity after the mid-1880s, that number increased and by 1912, ten new theaters had been built in Kansas City. By the 1920s, Kansas City was the center of the [[vaudevillian]] [[Orpheum circuit]].<ref name="londre" />

Kansas City jazz in the 1930s marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. The 1979 documentary ''[[The Last of the Blue Devils]]'' portrays this era in interviews and performances by local jazz notables. In the 1970s, Kansas City attempted to resurrect the glory of the jazz era in a family-friendly atmosphere. In the 1970s, an effort to open jazz clubs in the River Quay area of City Market along the Missouri ended in a [[wikt:turf war|gang war]]. Three of the new clubs were blown up in what ultimately ended Kansas City mob influence in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] casinos. The annual Kansas City Blues and Jazz Festival attracts top jazz stars and large tourist audiences. In 2007 it was rated Kansas City's "best festival" by ''The Pitch''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitch.com/bestof/2001/award/best-festival-15509/ |title=The Pitch, ''Best of 2007'': "Best Festival" – Kansas City's Blues and Jazz Festival |publisher=Pitch.com |access-date=May 5, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715091331/http://www.pitch.com/bestof/2001/award/best-festival-15509/ |archive-date=July 15, 2011 }}</ref>

Classic Kansas City-style barbecue was an inner-city phenomenon that evolved from the pit of [[Henry Perry (restaurateur)|Henry Perry]], a migrant from [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] who is generally credited with opening the city's first barbecue stand in 1921, and blossomed in the [[18th and Vine Historic District|18th and Vine]] neighborhood. [[Arthur Bryant's]] took over the Perry restaurant and added [[sugar]] to his sauce to sweeten the recipe a bit. In 1946 one of Perry's cooks, George W. Gates, opened Gates Bar-B-Q, later [[Gates and Sons Bar-B-Q]] when his son Ollie joined the family business. Bryant's and Gates are the two definitive Kansas City barbecue restaurants; native Kansas Citian and essayist Calvin Trillin famously called Bryant's "the single best restaurant in the world" in an essay he wrote for ''Playboy'' magazine in the 1960s. [[Fiorella's Jack Stack Barbecue]] is also well regarded. In 1977, [[Rich Davis]], a psychiatrist, test-marketed his own concoction called K.C. Soul Style Barbecue Sauce. He renamed it [[KC Masterpiece]], and in 1986, he sold the recipe to the [[Kingsford (charcoal)|Kingsford]] division of [[Clorox]]. Davis retained rights to operate restaurants using the name and sauce, whose recipe popularized the use of molasses as a sweetener in Kansas City-style barbecue sauces.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

Kansas City has several [[James Beard Award]]-winning/nominated chefs and restaurants. Winning chefs include Michael Smith, [[Celina Tio]], Colby Garrelts, Debbie Gold, Jonathan Justus and Martin Heuser. A majority of the Beard Award-winning restaurants are in the Crossroads district, downtown and in Westport.

In 1955, Kansas City became a major league city when the [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]] baseball franchise relocated to the city in 1955. Following the 1967 season, the team relocated to [[Oakland, California]].

Kansas City was represented in the [[National Basketball Association]] by the [[Sacramento Kings|Kansas City Kings]] (called the Kansas City-Omaha Kings from 1972 to 1975), when the former Cincinnati Royals moved to the Midwest in 1972. The team left for [[Sacramento]] in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theathletic.com/1747622/2020/04/16/from-despised-gm-to-missing-on-magic-to-low-attendance-the-story-behind-the-kings-demise-in-kansas-city/|title=From despised GM to missing on Magic: The story behind the King's demise in K.C.|last=Taylor|first=Nate|date=April 16, 2020|website=[[The Athletic]]|access-date=December 27, 2023|archive-date=December 27, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231227160157/https://theathletic.com/1747622/2020/04/16/from-despised-gm-to-missing-on-magic-to-low-attendance-the-story-behind-the-kings-demise-in-kansas-city/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1974, the [[National Hockey League]] placed an expansion team in Kansas City called the [[Kansas City Scouts]]. The team moved to [[Denver]] in 1976, then to [[New Jersey]] in 1982 where they have remained ever since as the [[New Jersey Devils]].

==Law and government==

===City government===
[[File:Kansas City Missouri City Hall.jpg|thumb|upright|City Hall, Kansas City, Missouri]]
{{See also|List of mayors of Kansas City|Alcohol laws of Missouri}}

Kansas City is home to the largest [[Kansas City, Missouri Municipal Government|municipal government]] in the state of Missouri. The city has a council/manager form of government. The role of [[city manager]] has diminished over the years. The non-elective office of city manager was created following excesses during the Pendergast days.

The mayor is the head of the [[Kansas City, Missouri City Council|Kansas City City Council]], which has 12 members elected from six districts (one member elected by voters in the district and one at-large member elected by voters citywide). The mayor is the presiding member. By charter, Kansas City has a "weak-mayor" system, in which most of the power is formally vested in the city council. However, in practice, the mayor is very influential in drafting and guiding public policy.

Kansas City holds city elections in every fourth odd-numbered year. The last citywide election was held in April 2023. The officials took office in August 2023 and will hold the position until 2027.

Pendergast was the most prominent leader during the machine politics days. The most nationally prominent Democrat associated with the machine was [[Harry S Truman]], who became a Senator, Vice President and then [[President of the United States]] from 1945 to 1953. Kansas City is the seat of the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri]], one of two [[United States district courts|federal district courts]] in Missouri. The [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri]] is in St. Louis. It also is the seat of the Western District of the [[Missouri Court of Appeals]], one of three districts of that court (the Eastern District is in St. Louis and the Southern District is in [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]]).

===National political conventions===
Kansas City hosted the [[1900 Democratic National Convention]], the [[1928 Republican National Convention]] and the [[1976 Republican National Convention]]. The urban core of Kansas City consistently votes Democratic in presidential elections; however, on the state and local level Republicans often find success, especially in the Northland and other suburban areas of Kansas City.

===Federal representation===
Kansas City is represented by three members of the [[United States House of Representatives]]:

===Crime===
[[File:Police Respond to Shooting.jpg|thumb|Police respond to a shooting in the [[Crossroads, Kansas City|Crossroads]] area during early New Year's Day 2016.]]
Some of the earliest organized violence in Kansas City was during the [[American Civil War]]. Shortly after the city's incorporation in 1850, so-called [[Bleeding Kansas]] erupted, affecting [[border ruffians]] and [[Jayhawkers]]. During the war, Union troops [[General Order № 11 (1863)|burned all occupied dwellings]] in Jackson County south of Brush Creek and east of Blue Creek to Independence in an attempt to halt raids into Kansas. After the war, the ''[[Kansas City Times]]'' turned outlaw [[Jesse James]] into a folk hero via its coverage. James was born in the Kansas City metro area at [[Kearney, Missouri]], and notoriously robbed the Kansas City Fairgrounds at 12th Street and Campbell Avenue.

In the early 20th century under Pendergast, Kansas City became the country's "most wide open town". Though this gave rise to [[Kansas City jazz]] and to the [[Kansas City crime family|Kansas City mob]] (initially under [[Johnny Lazia]]), and the arrival of [[organized crime]]. In the 1970s, the Kansas City mob was involved in a gang war over control of the [[River Quay]] entertainment district, in which three buildings were bombed and several gangsters were killed. Police investigations gained after boss [[Nick Civella]] was recorded discussing gambling bets on [[Super Bowl IV]] (where the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Minnesota Vikings). The war and investigation led to the end of mob control of the [[Stardust Casino]], which was the basis for the 1995 film ''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]'', though the production minimizes the Kansas City connections.

{{As of|November 2012}}, Kansas City [[United States cities by crime rate|ranked 18th]] on the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI)'s annual survey of crime rates for cities with populations over 100,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2013/02/01/fbi-violent-crime-drops-in-kansas.html |title=FBI: Violent crime drops in Kansas City for first half of 2012 |work=Kansas City Business Journal |date=February 1, 2013 |access-date=July 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730054734/http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2013/02/01/fbi-violent-crime-drops-in-kansas.html |archive-date=July 30, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Much of the city's violent crime occurs on the city's lower income East Side.

''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' is the area's primary newspaper. [[William Rockhill Nelson]] and his partner, [[Samuel Morss]], first published the evening paper on September 18, 1880. The ''Star'' competed with the morning ''Kansas City Times'' before acquiring that publication in 1901. The ''Times'' name was discontinued in March 1990, when the morning paper was renamed the ''Star''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Haskell |first=Harry |title=Boss-busters & sin hounds : Kansas City and its Star |date=2007 |publisher=University of Missouri Press |isbn=978-0-8262-6612-5 |location=Columbia |oclc=614533916}}</ref>

Kansas City broadcasting jobs have been a stepping stone for national television and radio personalities, notably [[Walter Cronkite]] and [[Mancow Muller]].

WDAF radio (now at [[WDAF-FM|106.5 FM]]; original 610 AM frequency now occupied by [[KFNZ (AM)|KFNZ]]) signed on in 1927 as an affiliate of the [[NBC Red Network]], under the ownership of ''The Star.'' In 1949, the ''Star'' signed on [[WDAF-TV]] as an affiliate of the [[NBC]] television network. The ''Star'' sold off the WDAF stations in 1957, following an [[antitrust]] investigation by the United States government (reportedly launched at Truman's behest, following a long-standing feud with the ''Star'') over the newspaper's ownership of television and radio stations. [[KCMO (AM)|KCMO]] radio (originally at 810 AM, now at 710 AM) signed on KCMO-TV (now [[KCTV]]) in 1953. The respective owners of [[WHB (AM)|WHB]] (then at 710 AM, now at 810 AM) and KMBC radio (980 AM, now [[KMBZ (AM)|KMBZ]]), Cook Paint and Varnish Company and the Midland Broadcasting Company, signed on [[KMBC-TV|WHB-TV/KMBC-TV]] as a time-share arrangement on VHF channel 9 in 1953; KMBC-TV took over channel 9 full-time in June 1954, after Cook Paint and Varnish purchased Midland Broadcasting's stations.

The major broadcast television networks have affiliates in the Kansas City market (covering 32 counties in northwestern Missouri, with the exception of counties in the far northwestern part of the state that are within the adjacent [[Saint Joseph, Missouri|Saint Joseph]] market, and northeastern Kansas); including [[WDAF-TV]] 4 ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]), [[KCTV]] 5 ([[CBS]]), [[KMBC-TV]] 9 ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]), [[KCPT]] 19 ([[PBS]]), [[KCWE]] 29 ([[The CW]]), [[KSHB-TV]] 41 ([[NBC]]) and [[KSMO-TV]] 62 ([[MyNetworkTV]]). Other television stations in the market include Saint Joseph-based [[KTAJ-TV]] 16 ([[Trinity Broadcasting Network|TBN]]), Kansas City, Kansas-based TV25.tv (consisting of three locally owned stations throughout northeast Kansas, led by KCKS-LD 25, affiliated with several [[digital subchannel|digital multicast]] networks), Lawrence, Kansas-based [[KMCI-TV]] 38 ([[Independent station|independent]]), Spanish-language station [[KUKC-LD]] 20 ([[Univision]]), Spanish-language station [[KGKC-LD]] 39 ([[Telemundo]]), and [[KPXE-TV]] 50 ([[Ion Television]]). The Kansas City television stations also serve as alternates for the nearby Saint Joseph television market.

===Film community===
Kansas City has been a locale for film and television productions. Between 1931 and 1982 Kansas City was home to the [[Calvin Company]], a large film production company that specialized in promotional shorts for corporations and in educational films for schools and the government. Calvin was an important venue for Kansas City arts, training local filmmakers who went on to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood careers]] and also employing local actors, most of whom earned their main income in fields such as radio and television announcing. Kansas City native [[Robert Altman]] directed movies at the Calvin Company, which led him to shoot his first feature film, ''[[The Delinquents (1957 film)|The Delinquents]]'', in Kansas City using many local players.

The 1983 television movie ''[[The Day After]]'' was filmed in Kansas City and Lawrence, Kansas. The 1995 film ''[[Truman (1995 film)|Truman]]'', starring [[Gary Sinise]], was filmed in the city. Other films shot in or around Kansas City include ''[[Article 99]]'', ''[[Mr. and Mrs. Bridge|Mr. & Mrs. Bridge]]'', ''[[Kansas City (film)|Kansas City]]'', ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]'', ''[[In Cold Blood (film)|In Cold Blood]]'', ''[[Ninth Street]]'', and ''[[Sometimes They Come Back (film)|Sometimes They Come Back]]'' (in and around nearby [[Liberty, Missouri]]). More recently, a scene in the controversial film ''[[Brüno]]'' was filmed in downtown Kansas City's historic Hotel Phillips.

Today, Kansas City is home to an active independent film community. The [[Independent Filmmaker's Coalition]] is an organization dedicated to expanding and improving independent filmmaking in Kansas City. The city launched the KC Film Office in October 2014 with the goal of better marketing the city for prospective television shows and movies to be filmed there. The City Council passed several film tax incentives in February 2016 to take effect in May 2016; the KC Film Office is coordinating its efforts with the State of Missouri to reinstate film incentives on a statewide level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/tax-breaks-for-films-could-bring-cash-to-kc|title=Tax breaks for films could bring cash to Kansas City|last=Monreal|first=Jane|date=April 2, 2016|publisher=KSHB|access-date=May 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417155354/http://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/tax-breaks-for-films-could-bring-cash-to-kc|archive-date=April 17, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Kansas City was named as a top city to live and work in as a movie maker in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|date=January 31, 2021|title=Best Places to Live and Work as a Moviemaker 2020|url=https://www.moviemaker.com/best-places-to-live-and-work-as-a-moviemaker-2020/3/|access-date=February 1, 2021|website=MovieMaker Magazine|archive-date=May 5, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210505052915/https://www.moviemaker.com/best-places-to-live-and-work-as-a-moviemaker-2020/3/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Transportation==
{{Main|Kansas City metropolitan area#Transportation|Kansas City metropolitan area}}
Originally, Kansas City was the launching point for travelers on the [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]], [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]], and [[California Trail|California]] trails. Later, with the construction of the [[Hannibal Bridge]] across the [[Missouri River]], it became the junction of 11 trunk railroads. More rail tonnage passes through the city than through any other U.S. city. [[Trans World Airlines]] (TWA) located its headquarters in the city, and had ambitious plans to turn the city into an air hub.

===Highways===
[[File:Alphamap.gif|thumb|Kansas City is a major meeting place for several of the nation's busiest highways.]]
Missouri and Kansas were the first states to start building interstates with [[Interstate 70]]. [[Interstate 435]], which encircles the entire city, is the second longest beltway in the [[Interstate Highway System]]. ([[Interstate 275 (Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana)|Interstate 275]] around [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] is the longest.) The Kansas City metro area has more limited-access highway lane-miles per capita than any other large US metro area, over 27% more than the second-place [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex]], over 50% more than the average American metropolitan area. From 2013 to 2017 the average commuting time was 21.8 minutes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/kansascitycitymissouri/PST045218|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Kansas City city, Missouri|website=census.gov|access-date=November 3, 2019|archive-date=May 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200513051925/https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/kansascitycitymissouri/PST045218|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Sierra Club]] blames the extensive freeway network for excessive [[urban sprawl|sprawl]] and the decline of central Kansas City.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sierraclub.org/sprawl/report98/kansas_city.asp |title=1998 Sprawl Report- Sprawl – Sierra Club |publisher=Sierraclub.org |access-date=May 5, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516193458/http://www.sierraclub.org/sprawl/report98/kansas_city.asp |archive-date=May 16, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, the relatively uncongested road network contributes significantly to Kansas City's position as one of America's largest [[logistics]] hubs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcsmartport.com/sec_news/media/documents/ShippingCentral.pdf |title=Shipping Central |website=Kcsmartport.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325133930/http://www.kcsmartport.com/sec_news/media/documents/ShippingCentral.pdf |archive-date=March 25, 2009 }}</ref>

====Other routes====
Other routes include the [[Chicago–Kansas City Expressway]] and the [[Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail]].

===Airports===
[[File:Kci.JPG|thumb|[[Kansas City International Airport]]]]
[[Kansas City International Airport]] (airport code MCI) was built to TWA's specifications to make a world hub.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flykci.com/newsroom/press-kit/backgrounder/|title=Backgrounder|website=Kansas City International Airport|access-date=October 8, 2019|archive-date=May 5, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210505072244/https://flykci.com/newsroom/press-kit/backgrounder/|url-status=live}}</ref> Its original passenger-friendly design placed each of its gates {{convert|100|ft|m}} from the street. Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], it required a costly overhaul to conform to tighter security protocols from the [[Transportation Security Administration]]. In March 2023, a new $1.5 billion terminal opened on the site of the old Terminal A.<ref>{{Citation|title=KCI Airport New Terminal Two Year Terminal A Demo Anniversary Time Lapse|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7reDz0J1R8| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/V7reDz0J1R8| archive-date=December 11, 2021 | url-status=live|language=en|access-date=August 14, 2021}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Designed by [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill]], it is a single, advanced technology terminal with 39 gates, eventually planned to entirely replace remaining Terminals B and C.

[[Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport]] (airport code MKC) was TWA's original headquarters and houses the [[Airline History Museum]]. It is used for [[general aviation]] and airshows.

===Public transportation===
Like most American cities, Kansas City's mass transit system was originally rail-based. From 1870 to 1957, Kansas City's streetcar system was among the top in the country, with over {{convert|300|mi|km}} of track at its peak. The rapid sprawl in the following years led this private system to be shut down.

Amtrak currently operates two routes via Kansas City, the Southwest Chief to Chicago or Los Angeles, and the Missouri River Runner to St. Louis.

====KCATA RideKC====
On December 28, 1965, the [[Kansas City Area Transportation Authority]] (KCATA) was formed via a bi-state compact created by the Missouri and Kansas legislatures. The compact gave the KCATA responsibility for planning, construction, owning, and operating passenger transportation systems and facilities within the seven-county area.

====RideKC Bus and MAX====
[[File:RideKC Bus.jpg|thumb|A newly branded RideKC Bus]]
In July 2005, the KCATA launched Kansas City's first [[bus rapid transit]] line, the [[Metro Area Express]] (MAX). MAX links River Market, Downtown, [[Kansas City Union Station|Union Station]], Crown Center, and Country Club Plaza.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kcata.org/maps_schedules/max/ |title=Maps and Schedules |publisher=KCATA |access-date=March 16, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420042341/http://www.kcata.org/maps_schedules/max |archive-date=April 20, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> MAX operates and is marketed more like a rail system than a local bus line. A unique identity was created for MAX, including 13 modern diesel buses and easily identifiable "stations". MAX features (real-time [[global positioning system|GPS]] tracking of buses, available at every station), and stoplights automatically change in their favor if buses are behind schedule. In 2010, a second MAX line was added on Troost Avenue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kcata.org/light_rail_max/max_and_bus_rapid_transit/ |title=Light Rail and MAX |publisher=KCATA |access-date=March 16, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115112506/http://www.kcata.org/light_rail_max/max_and_bus_rapid_transit/ |archive-date=January 15, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> The city is planning another MAX line down Prospect Avenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcata.org/light_rail_max/prospect_ave_study|title=Prospect Ave. MAX {{!}} Light Rail and MAX|publisher=KCATA|access-date=May 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602120949/http://www.kcata.org/light_rail_max/prospect_ave_study|archive-date=June 2, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

====RideKC Streetcar====
[[File:Streetcar 10main.jpg|thumb|KC Streetcar departs the Library stop, heading north to the River Market.]]
On December 12, 2012, a ballot initiative to construct a {{US$|102 million|long=no}}, {{convert|2|mi|adj=on}}, modern [[KC Streetcar]] line in downtown Kansas City was approved by local voters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2012/12/12/kansas-city-voters-approve-streetcar.html|title=Kansas City voters approve streetcar plan|newspaper=Kansas City Business Journal|access-date=January 26, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730051350/http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2012/12/12/kansas-city-voters-approve-streetcar.html|archive-date=July 30, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The streetcar route runs along Main Street from [[River Market]] to [[Union Station (Kansas City, Missouri)|Union Station]]; it debuted on May 6, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article76034492.html|title=Crowds jam streetcars in Kansas City return|website=kansascity|access-date=May 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507115829/http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article76034492.html|archive-date=May 7, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> A new non-profit corporation made up of private sector stakeholders and city appointees – the [[Kansas City Streetcar Authority]] – operates and maintains the system.

The Port Authority of Kansas City is also studying running an extension to [[Berkley Riverfront Park]].

====RideKC Bridj====
In 2015, the KCATA, Unified Government Transit, Johnson County Transit, and IndeBus began merging from individual metro services into one coordinated transit service for the metropolitan area, called RideKC. The buses and other transit options are branded as RideKC Bus, RideKC MAX, RideKC Streetcar, and RideKC Bridj. RideKC Bridj is a micro transit service partnership between Ford Bridj and KCATA that began on March 7, 2016, much like a [[taxicab]] service and with a [[mobile app]]. The merger and full coordination is expected to be complete by 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcata.org/news/ride_kc_bridj_begins_service_march_7|title=Ride KC: Bridj Begins Service March 7|publisher=Kansas City Area Transportation Authority|access-date=May 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510082640/http://www.kcata.org/news/ride_kc_bridj_begins_service_march_7|archive-date=May 10, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Intercity transit====
Intercity bus services to Kansas City are provided by [[Greyhound Lines]] and [[Jefferson Lines]] at the [[Kansas City Bus Station]]. [[Amtrak]] also serves the city at [[Kansas City Union Station|Union Station]] via the [[Southwest Chief]] and [[Missouri River Runner]].

===Walkability===
A 2015 study by [[Walk Score]] ranked Kansas City as the 42nd most walkable out of the 50 largest U.S. cities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.walkscore.com/MO/Kansas_City |title=2015 City and Neighborhood Rankings |publisher=Walk Score |year=2015 |access-date=August 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906150703/https://www.walkscore.com/MO/Kansas_City |archive-date=September 6, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> As a whole, the city has a score of 34 out of 100. However, several of the more densely populated neighborhoods have much higher scores: Westport has a score of 91, the Downtown Loop has a score of 85, the Crossroads scored 85, and the Plaza scored 83.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.walkscore.com/MO/Kansas_City|title=Kansas City neighborhoods on Walk Score|website=Walk Score|access-date=May 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416085712/https://www.walkscore.com/MO/Kansas_City|archive-date=April 16, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Those ratings range from "A Walker's Paradise" to "Very Walkable". In April 2017, voters approved an $800 million general obligation bond, part of which is designated for sidewalk repairs and creating complete-streets.

===Modal characteristics===
According to the American Community Survey, 81.6 percent of working Kansas City residents commuted to work by driving alone, 7.9 percent carpooled, 2.7 percent used public transportation, and 1.7 percent walked to work. About 1.5 percent commuted by other means, including taxi, bicycle, or motorcycle. About 4.6 percent of working Kansas City residents worked at home.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Census Reporter|title=Means of Transportation to Work by Age|access-date=May 6, 2018|url=https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B08101&geo_ids=16000US2938000&primary_geo_id=16000US2938000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507003324/https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B08101&geo_ids=16000US2938000&primary_geo_id=16000US2938000|archive-date=May 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>
