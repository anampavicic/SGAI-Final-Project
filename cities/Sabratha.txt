Sabratha's port was established, perhaps about 500{{nbsp}}BCE, as the [[Phoenicia]]n trading-post of '''Tsabratan''' ({{langx|xpu|‚Ä¨ê§ëê§Å‚Ä¨‚Ä¨ê§ìê§ï‚Ä¨ê§ç}}, {{smallcaps|·π£brtn}}, or {{lang|xpu|‚Ä¨ê§ëê§Å‚Ä¨‚Ä¨ê§ìê§ïê§è‚Ä¨ê§ç}}, {{smallcaps|·π£brt øn}}).{{sfnp|Ghaki|2015|p=67}}{{sfnp|Head & al.|1911}} This seems to have been a [[Berber language|Berber]] name,<ref name="CB">[https://books.google.com/books?id=Obu1zSDuUYsC&pg=PA35 Septimius Severus] page 2</ref> suggesting a pre√´xisting native settlement. The port served as a Phoenician outlet for the products of the African hinterland.
[[Greeks]] called it Sabrata ({{langx|grc|Œ£Œ±Œ≤œÅŒ¨œÑŒ±}}), Sabaratha ({{langx|grc|Œ£Œ±Œ≤Œ±œÅŒ±Œ∏Œ¨}}), Sabratha ({{langx|grc|Œ£Œ±Œ≤œÅŒ¨Œ∏Œ±}})

Following the Punic Wars, Sabratha became part of the short-lived [[Numidia]]n kingdom of [[Massinissa]] before this was annexed to the Roman Republic as the province of Africa Nova in the 1st century BC. It was subsequently [[romanization (cultural)|romanized]] and rebuilt in the 2nd and 3rd centuries{{nbsp}}CE. The Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] was born nearby in [[Leptis Magna]], and Sabratha reached its monumental peak during the rule of the Severans, when it nearly doubled in size. The city was badly damaged by earthquakes during the 4th century, particularly [[365 Crete earthquake|the quake of 365]]. It fell under control of the [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandal kingdom]] in the 5th century, with large parts of the city being abandoned. It enjoyed a small revival under [[Exarchate of Africa|Byzantine]] rule, when multiple churches and a defensive wall (although only enclosing a small portion of the city) were erected. The town was site of a [[bishopric]].<ref>Francois Decret, Early Christianity in North Africa(James Clarke & Co, 2011) p83</ref> Within a hundred years of the [[Islamic conquest of the Maghreb|Muslim invasion]] of the [[Maghreb]], trade had shifted to other ports and Sabratha dwindled to a village.

===Archaeological site===

[[File:Theatre, Sabratha.JPG|thumb|Theatre, 2006]]
Sabratha has been the place of several excavation campaigns since 1921, mainly by Italian archaeologists. It was also excavated by a British team directed by Dame [[Kathleen Kenyon]] and [[John Ward-Perkins]] between 1948 and 1951.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kenrick, Philip M.|title=Tripolitania|date=2009|publisher=Society for Libyan Studies|others=Society for Libyan Studies (London, England)|isbn=978-1-900971-08-9|location=London|oclc=320789516}}</ref> Besides its {{Interlanguage link|Theater at Sabratha|fr|3=Th√©√¢tre antique de Sabratha}} that retains its three-storey architectural backdrop, Sabratha has temples dedicated to [[Liber|Liber Pater]], [[Serapis]] and [[Isis]]. There is a Christian [[basilica]] of the time of [[Justinian I|Justinian]] and also remnants of some of the [[mosaic]] floors that enriched elite dwellings of Roman North Africa (for example, at the [https://www.temehu.com/Cities_sites/villa-silene.htm Villa Sileen], near [[Khoms, Libya|Khoms]]). However, these are most clearly preserved in the colored patterns of the seaward (or Forum) baths, directly overlooking the shore, and in the black and white floors of the theater baths. There is an adjacent museum containing some treasures from Sabratha, but others can be seen in the national museum in [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]].

In 1943, during the [[Second World War]], archaeologist [[Max Mallowan]], husband of novelist [[Agatha Christie]], was based at Sabratha as an assistant to the Senior Civil Affairs Officer of the Western Province of [[Tripolitania]]. His main task was to oversee the allocation of grain rations, but it was, in the words of Christie's biographer, a "glorious attachment", during which Mallowan lived in an Italian villa with a patio overlooking the sea and dined on fresh [[tuna|tunny]] fish and olives.<ref>[[Janet Morgan, Lady Balfour of Burleigh|Janet Morgan]] (1984) ''Agatha Christie: a Biography''</ref>

=== Erosion and weathering damage===
According to an April 2016 report, due to soft soil composition and the nature of the coast of Sabratha, which is mostly made up of soft rock and sand, the Ruins of Sabratha are undergoing dangerous periods of [[coastal erosion]]. The public baths, olive press building and 'harbor' can be observed as being most damaged as the buildings have crumbled due to storms and unsettled seas. As the most common building material in Sabratah, [[calcarenite]], is highly susceptible to physical, chemical and biological weathering (particularly marine spray), the long-term conservation of the monuments is endangered.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=El-Shahat|first1=Adam|last2=Minas|first2=Haithem|last3=Khomiara|first3=Sadek|date=March 2014|title=Weathering of Calcarenite Monuments at Roman and Byzantine Archaeological Sites at Sabratha, Northwestern Libya: A Pilot Study|journal=African Archaeological Review|volume=31|issue=1|pages=45‚Äì58|doi=10.1007/s10437-014-9153-8|s2cid=162221083|issn=0263-0338}}</ref> Rising sea levels can also compromise the integrity of the site.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Reimann|first1=Lena|last2=Vafeidis|first2=Athanasios T.|last3=Brown|first3=Sally|last4=Hinkel|first4=Jochen|last5=Tol|first5=Richard S. J.|date=2018-10-16|title=Mediterranean UNESCO World Heritage at risk from coastal flooding and erosion due to sea-level rise|journal=Nature Communications|volume=9|issue=1|page=4161|doi=10.1038/s41467-018-06645-9|pmid=30327459|pmc=6191433|issn=2041-1723|doi-access=free}}</ref>

This erosion of the coast of Ancient Sabratha can be seen yearly with significant differences in beach layout and recent crumbled buildings. Breakwaters set in the vicinity of the harbor and olive press are inadequate and too small to efficiently protect the Ancient City of Sabratha.

==Modern Sabratha==
The city is home to [[Sabratha University]]. [[Wefaq Sabratha]] is the football club, playing at [[Sabratha Stadium]].

As noted in the 2021 documentary ''[[The Beatles: Get Back]]'', directed by [[Peter Jackson]], the Sabratha Theater was considered as a possible location where [[the Beatles]] could hold their final live concert as a group (they instead performed their [[The Beatles' rooftop concert|last concert on the rooftop]] of their [[Apple Corps]] headquarters).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/platform/amp/reviews/22803457/the-beatles-get-back-review-documentary|title=Peter Jackson's Beatles series Get Back is a feast for one particular kind of fan|last=Daniels|first=Robert|date=26 November 2021|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|access-date=29 November 2021}}</ref>

==Climate==
Sabratha has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[K√∂ppen climate classification]] ''BSh'').
