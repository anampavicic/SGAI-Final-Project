==History==
[[File:OgatsuBay09r.jpg|thumb|Ogatsu in 2009]]

The area of present-day Ishinomaki was part of ancient [[Mutsu Province]]. During the [[Sengoku period]], the area was contested by various [[samurai]] clans before the area came under the control of the [[Date clan]] of [[Sendai Domain]] during the [[Edo period]]. The town prospered as a major port and transshipment center for coastal shipping between [[Edo]] and northern Japan. The town of Ishinomaki was established within [[Oshika District, Miyagi|Oshika District]] on June 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system.

The city was founded on April 1, 1933. On April 1, 2005, Ishinomaki absorbed the neighboring towns of [[Kahoku, Miyagi|Kahoku]], [[Kanan, Miyagi|Kanan]], [[Kitakami, Miyagi|Kitakami]], [[Monou, Miyagi|Monou]] and [[Ogatsu, Miyagi|Ogatsu]], and the town of [[Oshika, Miyagi|Oshika]] to more than quadruple its area and add nearly 60,000 people to its population.

The town of Ogatsu is regionally famous for its [[inkstone]]s and has an annual [[scallop]] festival in the summer. Ayukawa, a town in Oshika, was formerly a base for several ships in Japan's [[Whaling in Japan|whaling fleet]].

Many public schools were completely destroyed, including {{nihongo|Ishinomaki Okawa Elementary School|大川小学校}}, which lost 70 of 108 students and nine of 13 teachers and staff.<ref>{{cite news|author=Lah, Kyung |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/03/23/japan.missing.children/index.html |title=In Japan, parents try to go on: 'My child should come home to me' |work=[[CNN]] |date=23 March 2011 |access-date=23 March 2011}}</ref> There is still anger among some of the parents of the dead students because the teachers had wasted precious time in debating whether to evacuate to higher ground. And when the decision was finally made, the teachers had decided to get to higher ground further away from the school which necessitated crossing a nearby river bridge. It was here while crossing the bridge that both the teachers and students were swept away by the tsunami. This decision is deemed unreasonable by many of the parents because there is a hill right behind the school, which they could have reached quickly. One of the teachers had tried to persuade the other teachers to bring the students to safety uphill soon after the earthquake; when he was unsuccessful, he evacuated himself, managing to persuade one of the students to go with him - both survived. One of the teachers who survived the tsunami at the bridge later committed suicide.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gilhooly |first=Rob |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120311f3.html |title=Time has stopped for parents of dead and missing children |newspaper=[[The Japan Times]] |date=11 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314055441/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120311f3.html |archive-date=14 March 2012}}</ref><!--https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2012/03/11/national/time-has-stopped-for-parents-of-dead-and-missing-children/ --><ref>{{cite news |url= http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20111013f1.html|title=Parents unable to let go continue search for missing kids |first= Rob|last= Gilhooly|date= 13 October 2011|newspaper= [[The Japan Times]]|publisher= The Japan Times Ltd.|location= Japan|page= 3|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111214231410/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20111013f1.html|archive-date= 14 December 2011|access-date= 13 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110419f1.html|title=Loss-staggered school reopens|date= 19 April 2011|newspaper= [[The Japan Times]]|publisher= The Japan Times Ltd.|location= Japan|page= 3|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110514084752/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110419f1.html|archive-date= 14 May 2011|access-date= 13 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Kyodo News |author-link=Kyodo News |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110422a7.html |title=Loss-hit Ishinomaki school opens |newspaper=[[The Japan Times]] |date=22 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426052206/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110422a7.html |archive-date=26 April 2011}}</ref>

Ishinomaki employs several foreigners to teach English in all of its elementary and junior high schools, as well as the two municipal high schools. American teacher Taylor Anderson was killed by the tsunami.

The earthquake shifted the city southeast and downward, lowering it by as much as {{convert|1.2|m|ft}} in some areas and causing it to flood twice daily at [[high tide]]. A once sandy beach in the Kadonowaki area completely disappeared and tides now reach the wall that once separated the beach from the road. Near the Mangakan Island, a walkway with benches was partially submerged in the river.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/california/ci_18026656?nclick_check=1 | title=Quake shifted Japan; towns now flood at high tide | work=Contra Costa Times/Associated Press | date=9 May 2011 | access-date=9 May 2011 | author=Alabaster, Jay | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530133541/http://www.contracostatimes.com/california/ci_18026656?nclick_check=1 | archive-date=30 May 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Rebuilding ===
Since 2011, Ishinomaki and other municipalities have been focusing on rebuilding and attracting residents back into the area. In 2019, eight years after the tragedy, [[Okawa Elementary School]] remains in ruins, as a memorial to those that were lost in the tsunami. Numerous parents who lost children due to staff errors sued the school and won in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|title=New principals in Miyagi meet with relatives of kids lost to tsunami|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/13900016|access-date=2020-12-17|website=The Asahi Shimbun|language=en}}</ref>
