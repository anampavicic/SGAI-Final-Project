'''Igarassu''' (or Igaraçu{{Ref|A|A}}) is a city in the [[Brazil]]ian state of [[Pernambuco]]. It is the second oldest city of the country and is situated on the north coast of the metropolitan region of [[Recife]], approximately {{convert|32|km|mi}}. It stands as one of the earliest [[Europe]]an settlements in Brazil and is the site of the oldest church in the country, the [[Church of Saints Cosme and Damião]], built in 1535. Igarassu is home to numerous colonial-period historic structures. The historic center of the city was designated a national monument by the [[National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage]] (IPHAN) in 1972.<ref name="hpip"/><ref name="i"/><ref name="iga"/>

==History==

Igarassu was inhabited by [[Caetés Indians]] before the arrival of Europeans in the 16th century. Its genesis as a town came with the arrival in the area of [[Duarte Coelho|Duarte Coelho Pereira]] in 1535. Coelho's arrival marked the beginning of the Portuguese settlement of Brazil.<ref name="ib">{{cite book | title=Brazil| last=Colwell| first=Dan| year=2000| publisher=JPM Publications| isbn=2-88452-117-8}}</ref>

The town itself was established in 1537 as the village of Igarassu, which means “Great Canoe” in Tupi-Guaraní. It was one of the first European settlements of the [[Capitania|Hereditary Captaincy]] (a Portuguese administrative division) of [[Pernambuco]]. Shortly after Coelho's arrival he ordered a rock landmark erected to mark the border between Pernambuco and [[Itamaracá]]; this still stands today. Igarassu was destroyed at the end of the [[Dutch Brazil|Dutch occupation of Brazil]] in the mid-17th century. Architectural materials from the ruins of Igarassu were used to build the town of [[Olinda]].<ref name="ib"/>

Igarassu grew from the 16th century as a result of the [[sugar cane]] trade; the town served as a point of transport between the sugar mills on the interior of Pernambuco and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] ports.<ref name="IPHAN"/>

Igarassu was the site of the brief liberal republican [[Praieira revolt]] in 1848, in which the troops of Colonel Manuel Pereira de Morais were installed in the [[Convent of Saint Antônio]]. Today the Pinacoteca Museum stands in its place. One of the military officers who put down the revolt was [[Deodoro da Fonseca]], later briefly the first president of the Brazilian republic.
