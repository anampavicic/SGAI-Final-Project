'''Nonsan''' ({{Korean|hangul=논산}}; {{IPA|ko|non.san}}) is a [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|city]] in [[South Chungcheong Province]], [[South Korea]].  It is located at {{Coord|36|12|N|127|5|E|region:KR-44_type:city(136,356)}}. The origin of Nonsan's geographical names is said to have come from the small garden " Nolmoe, " which rises in the middle of farming fields, where rice paddies and mountain are said to reflect geographical features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nonsan.go.kr/history.do?mno=sub01_02 |script-title=ko:논산 100주년|date=2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409233410/http://www.nonsan.go.kr/history.do?mno%3Dsub01_02|archive-date=2018-04-09|url-status=dead|access-date=2018-04-09}}</ref> The city belongs to the Daejeon Metropolitan Area.

==History==
Nonsan has a significant history.<ref>''눈산의 어제이야기'', Nonsan Moon-hoa ueon: Nonsan Naedong, 2007.</ref> During the [[Samhan]] period, Nonsan is believed to have been part of [[Mahan confederacy|Mahan]] territory.  In the [[Baekje]] period, the district belonged to Hwangdeungyasan-gun.  The crucial battle in which Silla defeated Baekje is thought to have taken place in the general area of Nonsan.  Later, in the [[Silla]] period, Nonsan was divided into two different towns: Deogeun and Hwangsan.

The train station was built in 1911, in the same year as the rail line through the Nonsan plain was completed.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z1sw3zcrNK4C|title=Landownership under Colonial Rule: Korea's Japanese Experience, 1900-1935|last=Grager|first=Edwin H.|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1994|isbn=9780824814977|pages=195|access-date=2018-04-16}}</ref>

The modern city of Nonsan was established in 1914, by the merger of the four [[Administrative divisions of South Korea#Gun (County)|counties]] of [[Yeonsan-myeon|Yeonsan]]-gun, [[Eunjin]]-gun, [[Noseong]]-gun and [[Seoksung]]-gun.

During the [[Korean War]], a [[POW camp]] was set up by the U.S. and South Korean forces.  On June 18, 1953, at the Nonsan camp as well as at POW camps at [[Busan]], 
[[Masan]], and [[Kwangju-si|Kwangju]], thousands of POWs swarmed out of the camps and melted into the local population in order to avoid being repatriated to North Korea.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3lneXum_j6EC|title=The Unfinished War: Korea|last=Lee|first=Bong|publisher=Algora|year=2003|isbn=9780875862323|location=new York|pages=222|access-date=2018-04-16}}</ref>

==Transportation==
Nonsan is served by the [[Rail transport in South Korea|national railroad]] system and city, regional and national bus lines. An [[Controlled-access highway|expressway]] connects the city to [[Daejeon]] and other cities. Many streets have [[bike path]]s, sharing pavement with sidewalks. The stream running through the city proper is not navigable, but downstream it joins the [[Geum River]], and an outlying subdivision of the city serves as a significant fishing port.

Chungcheong Metropolitan Railroad is proposed, in the third phase, to set Ganggyeong Station for the starting point and connect the city with [[Gyeryong]], Daejeon, and [[Cheongju]].

==Economics and industry==
Nonsan is an agricultural city, with [[rice]] being the most important crop.  Other important crops include [[strawberries]], [[ginseng]], [[napa cabbage]],<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2937176|title=Grocery prices carousel never stops spinning|website=Korea JoongAng Daily|access-date=2018-04-16}}</ref>
[[watermelon]]s, and [[Korean pear]]s.
According to ''[[The Chosun Ilbo]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://japanese.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2005/03/22/20050322000063.html |title=朝鮮日報 Chosunilbo (Japanese Edition) |access-date=2006-09-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010201243/http://japanese.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2005/03/22/20050322000063.html |archive-date=2006-10-10 |language=ja}}</ref> the farmers are growing new varieties of strawberry produced in Japan without the producer's permission, while the ''[[JoongAng Daily]]'' says "Strawberries grown in Nonsan are of various types: seolhyang, maehyang, geumhyang, janghi (akihime) and yukbo (red pearl). The first three were developed in Nonsan while the latter two are from Japan. Janghi is the most commonly grown in Korea. However, seolhyang is the sweetest".<ref>Limb Jae-un "Let Me Take You down to Nonsan," February 16, 2007</ref> Sesil [pronounced "say -shill"] company is the world's third leading producer of insects for natural pest control.  The prominent [[yogurt]] company, [[Korea Yakult|Yakult]], has its headquarters in Nonsan.  Agro-Fisheries Trade Corp. is a regional supplier of food products.<ref name=":0" />
