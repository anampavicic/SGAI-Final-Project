'''Rustavi''' ({{lang-ka|რუსთავი}} {{IPA-ka|ɾustʰavi||}}) is a city in the southeast of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], in the [[mkhare|region]] of [[Kvemo Kartli]] and {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} southeast of capital [[Tbilisi]]. It has a population of 132,333 (January 2023<ref>{{Cite web |title=Population - National Statistics Office of Georgia |url=https://www.geostat.ge/en/modules/categories/41/population |access-date=2023-06-28 |website=www.geostat.ge |language=en}}</ref>), making it the [[List of cities and towns in Georgia (country)|fourth most populous]] city in Georgia. Its economy is dominated by the [[Rustavi Steel|Rustavi Metallurgical Plant]].

==History==
Rustavi is one of the ancient towns of Georgia. The history of Rustavi has two phases: an early history from ancient times until the city was destroyed in the 13th century and modern history from the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era to the present.

===Early history===
The 11th-century [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] chronicler, [[Leonti Mroveli]] in his work "''[[The Georgian Chronicles|Georgian Chronicles]]''" connects the foundation of the city to [[Kartlos]], the [[Origin myth|eponymous ancestor]] of [[Georgians]], whose wife had founded a town along the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura river]] called Bostan-Kalaki ([[Literal translation|lit.]] "''city of gardens''"). The same chronicler, who also worked on “''The life of the Kings''”, mentions the town Rustavi among those castles, which opposed [[Alexander the Great]]'s army, although it is proved that Alexander had never invaded Iberia. Rustavi is mentioned among such ancient towns as Uplistsikhe, Urbnisi, Mtskheta and Sarkineti. It could be assumed that Rustavi as a city had been founded at least in the 5th–4th centuries B.C. Besides the manuscripts, the excavations of the castle Rustavi prove that Rustavi was an important political and administrative center of Iberia. In late 4th century A.D [[Trdat of Iberia]] had built a church and a canal in Rustavi.
[[File:Rustaviscixe.JPG|left|thumb|Rustavi fortress]]
During the reign of [[Vakhtang I of Iberia]] (5th century) Rustavi took an important part in the political life of the Kingdom of Iberia. At the beginning of the 6th century, in 503, the [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanids]] conquered Iberia and turned it into an ordinary Persian province ruled by a ''[[Marzban|marzpan]]'' (governor). However, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Heraclius]]'s offensive in 627 and 628 brought final victory over the Persians and ensured Byzantine predominance in Georgia, until the [[Arab rule in Georgia|invasion of the Arabs]]. In the struggle against Arab occupation Rustavi belonged to the [[Principality of Kakheti]], the latter would form the [[Kingdom of Kakheti-Hereti|Kakhetian kingdom]], whose ruler [[Kvirike III of Kakheti|Kvirike III the Great]], installed an [[Eristavi]] (duke) in Rustavi. On Kvirike's death, Kakheti was temporarily annexed to the [[Kingdom of Georgia]].<ref>[[Cyril Toumanoff|Toumanoff, Cyrille]] (1976, Rome).

There was a terrible battle between king [[Bagrat IV of Georgia]] and the Seljuks, where Bagrat was bitterly defeated and as a result, the king of Kakheti gained independence developing closer contact with the Turkish-Seljuks and securing independence in this way. After the [[Great Turkish Invasion|Seljukid invasions of Georgia]], allied forces took Tbilisi and Rustavi and gave it to the [[Emirate of Tbilisi|Emir of Tbilisi]]. During that time Rustavi declined, its economy was ruined, and due to its strategic location it only remained as a well-fortified town in the hands of the emirs in Tbilisi. In 1069 Bagrat IV defeated emir Fadlun and captured the fortress of Rustavi, Partskhisi, and [[Agarani Fortress|Agarani]]. During the [[History of Georgia (country)#King David IV the Builder and Georgian Reconquista|anti-Seljuk campaigns]] led by [[David IV of Georgia|David IV]] Rustavi played an essential role in securing Georgia's southern boundaries. Rustavi was finally destroyed after [[Timur's invasions of Georgia|Timur's invasion of Georgia]].

===Modern history===
Rustavi was rebuilt as a major industrial center during the Soviet era. The development of Rustavi was part of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s accelerated industrialization process, and included ironworks, steelworks, chemical plants and an important railway station on the [[Tbilisi]]–[[Baku]] railroad line. Rustavi is the site of approximately 90 large and medium-sized industrial plants.

[[File:Rustavi Metallurgical Plant.jpg|thumb|left|Head office of Rustavi Steel Works]]
[[File:Kostava Street, Rustavi (Photo A. Muhranoff, 2011).jpg|thumb|270px|Kostava Street, Rustavi]]
The core of the city's industrial activity was the [[Rustavi Steel|Rustavi Metallurgical Plant]], constructed in 1941–1950 to process [[iron ore]] from nearby [[Azerbaijan]]. Stalin brought workers from various regions in Georgia, specifically from the poorer rural provinces of Western Georgia. Rustavi became a key industrial center for the Transcaucasus region. The industrial activity expanded to include the manufacture of [[steel]] products, cement, chemicals, and synthetic fibers.

May 1944 was a significant time in the history of modern Rustavi. Geologists began to define the soil of the place where the metallurgical works were to be built. The area was nearly empty, and there were only temporary lodgings and slums available. Many people arrived at Rustavi, coming from different parts of Georgia. The first newspaper came out on 30 August 1944. It was called “Metallurgiisatvis” (meaning "For Metallurgy" in Georgian).

Rustavi celebrated frequent housewarming parties as many people migrated to the city each day. In 1948 the first streets were “baptized” in Rustavi. The first street was named after the [[Young Communist League]], the second, after the builders of Rustavi, and the third, after its ancient name Bostan-Kalaki.

On 19 January 1948, a decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic declared Rustavi a town of republican importance. On 27 April 1950, the whole town celebrated the production of the first industrial Georgian steel. The theme of the celebration was dedicated to an ancient people whom are believed to have originally settled the area, known as the [[Khalib]]s.

[[File:Rustavi 17677 (14337607157).jpg|thumb|270px|Factories]]German [[POW]]s who were captured in [[World War II]] were enlisted to build the city of Rustavi. Modern Rustavi is divided into two parts—''Dzveli Rustavi'' (Old Rustavi) and ''Akhali Rustavi'' (New Rustavi). Old Rustavi adheres to Stalinist architectural style while New Rustavi is dominated by a multitude of Soviet-era block apartments. The [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 proved disastrous for Rustavi, as it also caused the collapse of the integrated Soviet economy of which the city was a key part. Most of its industrial plants were shut down and 65% of the city's population became unemployed, with the attendant social problems of high crime and acute poverty that such a situation brings. The population shrank from 160,000 in the mid-1990s to 116,000 in 2002 as residents moved elsewhere in search of work.

New York-based artist [[Greg Lindquist]] (b. 1979) has documented Rustavi's crumbling concrete factories in his paintings and installations, such as the exhibition "Nonpasts" in 2010. Lindquist has also worked with Georgian collaborators, such as artist Gio Sumbadze (b. 1976), in projects that address the current social, cultural and political significance of these architectures. In 2010, the Laura Palmer Foundation staged an exhibition at the Ministry of Transportation building ([[Tbilisi Roads Ministry Building]]) in which Lindquist and Sumbadze installed paintings addressing the history of Georgia's transportation system. This BOMB magazine [http://bombsite.com/issues/1000/articles/4764 interview] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106121201/http://bombsite.com/issues/1000/articles/4764 |date=2011-11-06 }} with La Toya Frazier for the exhibition "Planet of Slums" addresses many of the complexities of Lindquist's work in the Republic of Georgia.

== Demographics ==
[[File:Megobroba avenue.JPG|thumb|270px|Rapid expansion under Soviet rule]]
At the beginning of 2021, Rustavi had more than 130,072 inhabitants,<ref name="geostatpop">{{Cite web | url=https://www.geostat.ge/en/modules/categories/41/population | title=Population and Demography - Population by cities and boroughs (daba), as of 1 January | date=2021-01-01 | accessdate=2022-03-31 | work=National Statistics Office of Georgia, Geostat | language=en}}</ref> an increase of 4% since the 2014 census.<ref name=census2014detail>{{Cite web |url=http://census.ge/files/pdf/2014-wlis-aRweris-ZiriTadi-Sedegebi.pdf |title=Main Results of the 2014 Census (Publication) |work=Census.ge, National Statistics Office of Georgia (Geostat) |pages=316–317 |date=2016-04-28 |accessdate=2022-03-31 |language=ka |archive-date=2020-02-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200213232229/http://census.ge/files/pdf/2014-wlis-aRweris-ZiriTadi-Sedegebi.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> This increase makes Rustavi the [[List of cities and towns in Georgia (country)|fourth most populous]] city in Georgia, just behind [[Kutaisi]], which is suffering from ongoing contraction. Rustavi experienced rapid growth due to [[Industrialization in the Soviet Union|industrialization]] under [[Jozef Stalin|Stalin]]. Following Georgian independence in 1991, and the years of civil war and crisis that followed, many residents emigrated due to unemployment. The low point was reached around 2002, with growth picking up in the 2010s while industrial activities and employment have resumed. 

In 2014, the '''ethnic composition''' of Rustavi was almost 92% [[Georgians|Georgian]], with minority communities of [[Azerbaijanis in Georgia|Azerbaijanis]] (3.7%), [[Armenians]] (1.6%) and [[Russians]] (1.2%). More than 500 [[Ossetians]] (0.4%) lived in the city. Other ethnic minorities included 315 [[Ukrainians]], 239 [[Yazidis]], 166 [[Pontic Greeks|Greeks]], 55 [[Assyrians in Georgia|Assyrians]] and smaller numbers of [[Kist people|Kists]], [[Jews]], [[Abkhazians|Abkhazian]] and [[Lom people|Bosha]].

The proportions of the ethnic minorities in the city has not always been this way. Especially in the Soviet period these were completely different, with striking numbers of Russians. The city also had a substantial Ossetian community. Migration during and after the fall of the Soviet Union and due to civil conflicts has made the city much more mono-ethnic Georgian.
