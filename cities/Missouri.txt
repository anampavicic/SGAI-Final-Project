In the south are the [[Ozarks]], a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The [[Missouri River]], after which the state is named, flows through the center and into the [[Mississippi River]], which makes up the eastern border. With over six million residents, it is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|18th-most populous]] state of the country.

Humans have inhabited present-day Missouri for at least 12,000 years. The [[Mississippian culture]], which emerged in the ninth century, built cities and [[Mound Builders|mounds]] before declining in the 14th century. The Indigenous [[Osage Nation|Osage]] and [[Missouria]] nations inhabited the area when European people arrived in the 17th century. The French incorporated the territory into [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]], founding [[Ste. Genevieve, Missouri|Ste. Genevieve]] in 1735 and [[St. Louis]] in 1764. After a brief period of [[New Spain|Spanish rule]], the United States acquired Missouri as part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803. Americans from the [[Upland South]] rushed into the new [[Missouri Territory]]; Missouri played a central role in the westward expansion of the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm|title=Pony Express National Historic Trail (U.S. National Park Service)|first1=Mailing Address: National Trails Intermountain Region Pony Express National Historic Trail PO Box 728 Santa|last1=Fe|first2=NM 87504 Phone:741-1012 Contact|last2=Us|website=www.nps.gov|access-date=February 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223120436/https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm|archive-date=February 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Missouri was admitted as a slave state as part of the [[Missouri Compromise|Missouri Compromise of 1820]].

Today the state is divided into [[List of counties in Missouri|114 counties]] and the [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]] of St. Louis.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The state is named for the [[Missouri River]], which was named after the indigenous [[Missouria]], a [[Siouan languages|Siouan-language]] tribe. French colonists adapted a form of the [[Illinois language]]-name for the people: ''Wimihsoorita''. Their name means "One who has dugout canoes".<ref>McCafferty, Michael. 2004. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american_speech/v079/79.1mccafferty.html "Correction: Etymology of Missouri"], ''American Speech,'' 79.1:32</ref>

The name ''Missouri'' has several different pronunciations even among its present-day inhabitants,<ref name="wheaton20121013">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/13/us/politics/missouree-missouruh-to-be-politic-in-missouri-say-both.html | title=Missouree?

Donald M.

=== Nicknames===

There is no official state nickname.<ref name="Slogan" /> However, Missouri's unofficial nickname is the "Show Me State", which appears on its [[Vehicle registration plates of Missouri|license plates]]. This phrase has several origins. One is popularly ascribed to a speech by Congressman [[Willard Vandiver]] in 1899, who declared that "I come from a state that raises corn and cotton, [[cocklebur]]s and Democrats, and frothy eloquence neither convinces nor satisfies me. I'm from Missouri, and you have got to show me." This is in keeping with the saying "I'm from Missouri", which means "I'm skeptical of the matter and not easily convinced."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/skepticism|title=skepticism|via=The Free Dictionary|access-date=April 19, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709042936/http://www.thefreedictionary.com/skepticism|archive-date=July 9, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> However, according to researchers, the phrase "show me" was already in use before the 1890s.<ref>{{Citation | title = Barry Popik | contribution = I'm from Missouri—Show Me | url = http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/summary3 | access-date = August 14, 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061028071822/http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/summary3/ | archive-date = October 28, 2006 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Another one states that it is a reference to Missouri miners who were taken to [[Leadville, Colorado]] to replace striking workers.

=== Early history ===
[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] excavations along river valleys have shown continuous habitation since about 9000 BCE.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Missouri - History|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Missouri-state|access-date=March 3, 2021|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|archive-date=March 9, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210309080758/https://www.britannica.com/place/Missouri-state|url-status=live}}</ref> Beginning before 1000 [[Common Era|CE]], the people of the [[Mississippian culture]] created regional political centers at present-day [[St. Louis]] and across the [[Mississippi River]] at [[Cahokia]], near present-day [[Collinsville, Illinois]]. Their large cities included thousands of individual residences. Still, they are known for their surviving massive [[Earthwork (archaeology)|earthwork mounds]], built for religious, political and social reasons, in [[Platform mound|platform]], [[ridge]]top and [[Cone (geometry)|conical]] shapes. Cahokia was the center of a regional trading network that reached from the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The civilization declined by 1400 CE, and most descendants left the area long before the arrival of Europeans. St. Louis was at one time known as Mound City by the European Americans because of the numerous surviving prehistoric mounds since lost to urban development. The Mississippian culture left mounds throughout the middle Mississippi and Ohio river valleys, extending into the southeast and the upper river.
[[File:Gateway Arch edit1.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Gateway Arch]] in St. Louis]]

The land that became the state of Missouri was part of numerous different territories, possessed changing and often indeterminate borders, and had many different [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and European names between the 1600s and statehood. For much of the first half of the 1700s, the west bank of the [[Mississippi River]] that would become Missouri was mostly uninhabited, something of a no man's land that kept peace between the [[Illinois]] on the east bank of the Mississippi River and to the North, and the Osage and Missouri Indians of the lower Missouri Valley. In the early 1700s, French traders and missionaries explored the whole of the Mississippi Valley, and named the region "Louisiana". Around the same time, a different group of French Canadians established five villages on the east bank of the Mississippi River and identified their settlements as being in le pays des Illinois, "the country of the Illinois". When settlers of [[French Canadians|French Canadian]] descent began crossing the Mississippi River to establish settlements such as Ste. Genevieve, they continued to identify their settlements as being in the Illinois Country. At the same time, the French settlements on both sides of the Mississippi River were part of the French province of [[Louisiana]]. To distinguish the settlements in the Middle Mississippi Valley from French settlements in the lower Mississippi Valley around New Orleans, French officials and inhabitants referred to the Middle Mississippi Valley as La Haute Louisiane, "The High Louisiana", or "Upper Louisiana".

The first European settlers were mostly ethnic [[French Canadian]]s, who created their first settlement in Missouri at present-day [[Ste. Genevieve, Missouri|Ste. Genevieve]], about {{convert|45|mi|km}} south of St. Louis. They had migrated in about 1750 from the [[Illinois]] Country. They came from colonial villages on the east side of the Mississippi River, where soils were becoming exhausted and there was insufficient river bottom land for the growing population. The early Missouri [[Human settlement|settlements]] included many enslaved Africans and Native Americans, and slave labor was central to both commercial agriculture and the fur trade. Sainte-Geneviève became a thriving agricultural center, producing enough surplus wheat, [[Maize|corn]] and tobacco to ship tons of grain annually downriver to Lower Louisiana for trade. Grain production in the Illinois Country was critical to the survival of Lower Louisiana and especially the city of New Orleans.

St. Louis was founded on February 14, 1764, by French fur traders [[Gilbert Antoine de St. Maxent]], [[Pierre Laclède]], and [[Auguste Chouteau]].<ref name="Cazorla et al">Cazorla, Frank; Baena, Rose; Polo, David; and Reder Gadow, Marion. (2019) ''The governor Louis de Unzaga (1717–1793) Pioneer in the Birth of the United States of America''. Foundation, Malaga, pages 49, 57–65, 70–75, 150, 207</ref> From 1764 to 1803, European control of the area west of the Mississippi to the northernmost part of the Missouri River basin, called Louisiana, was assumed by the Spanish as part of the Viceroyalty of [[New Spain]], due to [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]]<ref name="foley 1989 26">Foley (1989), 26.</ref> (in order to have Spain join with France in the war against England). The arrival of the Spanish in St. Louis was in September 1767.

St. Louis became the center of a regional [[fur trade]] with Native American tribes that extended up the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, dominating the regional economy for decades. Trading partners of major firms shipped their furs from St. Louis by river down to New Orleans for export to Europe. They provided a variety of goods to traders for sale and trade with their Native American clients. The fur trade and associated businesses made St. Louis an early financial center and provided the wealth for some to build fine houses and import luxury items. Its location near the confluence of the Illinois River meant it also handled produce from the agricultural areas. River traffic and trade along the Mississippi were integral to the state's economy. As the area's first major city, St. Louis expanded greatly after the invention of the [[steamboat]] and the increased river trade.

Napoleon Bonaparte had gained Louisiana for French ownership from Spain in 1800 under the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]] after it had been a Spanish colony since 1762, but the treaty was kept secret. Louisiana remained nominally under Spanish control until a transfer of power to France on November 30, 1803, just three weeks before the cession to the United States.

Part of the 1803 [[Louisiana Purchase]] by the United States, Missouri earned the nickname ''Gateway to the West'' because it served as a significant departure point for expeditions and settlers heading to the West during the 19th century. [[St. Charles, Missouri|St. Charles]], just west of St. Louis, was the starting point and the return destination of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], which ascended the Missouri River in 1804, to explore the western lands to the Pacific Ocean. For decades, [[St. Louis]] was a major supply point for parties of settlers heading west.

As many of the early settlers in western Missouri migrated from the [[Upper South]], they brought enslaved [[African American]]s as agricultural laborers, and they desired to continue their culture and the institution of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. They settled predominantly in 17 counties along the [[Missouri River]], in an area of flatlands that enabled [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] agriculture and became known as "[[Little Dixie (Missouri)|Little Dixie]]".

The state was rocked by the [[1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes]]. Casualties were few due to the sparse population.

In the early 1830s, [[Mormon]] migrants from northern states and Canada began settling near [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]] and areas just north of there. Conflicts over religion and slavery arose between the 'old settlers' (mainly from the South) and the Mormons (mainly from the North). The [[Mormon War (1838)|Mormon War]] erupted in 1838. By 1839, with the help of an "Extermination Order" by Governor [[Lilburn Boggs]], the old settlers forcibly expelled the Mormons from Missouri and confiscated their lands.

Conflicts over slavery exacerbated border tensions among the states and territories. From 1838 to 1839, a border dispute with [[Iowa]] over the so-called [[Honey Lands]] resulted in both states' calling-up of [[Militia (United States)|militias]] along the border.

With increasing migration, from the 1830s to the 1860s, Missouri's population almost doubled with every decade. Most newcomers were American-born, but many Irish and German immigrants arrived in the late 1840s and 1850s. As a majority were [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], they set up their own religious institutions in the state, which had been mostly [[Protestant]]. Many settled in cities, creating a regional and then state network of Catholic churches and schools. 19th-century German immigrants created the wine industry along the Missouri River and the beer industry in St. Louis.

While many German immigrants were strongly anti-slavery,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/little-known-history-german-immigrants-missouri-were-anti-slavery-allies|title=A Little-Known History: German Immigrants In Missouri Were Anti-Slavery Allies|last=Davis|first=Chad|website=news.stlpublicradio.org|date=February 21, 2019|access-date=October 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029004344/https://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/little-known-history-german-immigrants-missouri-were-anti-slavery-allies|archive-date=October 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/planning/cultural-resources/preservation-plan/Part-I-Peopling-St-Louis.cfm|title=Part I: Peopling St. Louis|website=stlouis-mo.gov|access-date=October 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029004330/https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/planning/cultural-resources/preservation-plan/Part-I-Peopling-St-Louis.cfm|archive-date=October 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> many Irish immigrants living in cities were pro-slavery, fearing that liberating African-American slaves would create a glut of unskilled labor, driving wages down.<ref name=":1" />

Most Missouri farmers practiced [[subsistence farming]] before the [[American Civil War]]. The majority of those who held slaves had fewer than five each. [[Planter (plantation owner)|Planters]], defined by some historians as those holding 20 slaves or more, were concentrated in the counties known as "[[Little Dixie (Missouri)|Little Dixie]]", in the central part of the state along the [[Missouri River]].

===American Civil War===

{{Main|Ordinance of Secession|Missouri in the American Civil War|Confederate government of Missouri}}
[[File:NPS CW at a Glance Western 1864.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|[[Price's Raid]] in the [[Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War|Trans-Mississippi Theater]], 1864]]

After the secession of Southern states began in 1861, the Missouri legislature called for the election of a special convention on secession. This convention voted against secession, but also qualified their support of the Union. In the aftermath of [[Battle of Fort Sumter]] Pro-Southern Governor [[Claiborne F. Jackson]] ordered the mobilization of several hundred members of the state militia who had gathered in a camp in [[St. Louis]] for training. In secret, he also requested Confederate arms and artillery to help take the [[St. Louis Arsenal]]. Alarmed at this action, and discovering the Confederate aid, General [[Nathaniel Lyon]] struck first, encircling the camp and forcing the state troops to surrender. Lyon directed his soldiers, largely non-English-speaking German [[immigrants]], to march the prisoners through the streets, and this led to riot by pro-secession citizens. While it is disputed how it started, this riot led to violence and Union soldiers killed by St. Louis civilians. The event as a whole, is called the [[Camp Jackson Affair]].

These events sharpened the divisions within the state. Governor Jackson appointed [[Sterling Price]], president of the convention on secession, as head of the new [[Missouri State Guard]]. In the face of Union General Lyon's rapid advance through the state, Jackson and Price were forced to flee the capital of [[Jefferson City]] on June 14, 1861. In [[Neosho, Missouri]], Jackson called the state legislature into session to call for secession. However, the elected legislative body was split between pro-Union and pro-Confederate. As such, few of the pro-unionist attended the session called in Neosho, and the ordinance of secession was quickly adopted. The Confederacy recognized Missouri secession on October 30, 1861.

With the elected governor absent from the capital and the legislators largely dispersed, the state convention was reassembled with most of its members present, save twenty who fled south with Jackson's forces. The convention declared all offices vacant and installed [[Hamilton Gamble]] as the new governor of Missouri. President Lincoln's administration immediately recognized Gamble's government as the legal Missouri government. The federal government's decision enabled raising pro-Union militia forces for service within the state and volunteer regiments for the Union Army.

Fighting ensued between Union forces and a combined army of General Price's Missouri State Guard and Confederate troops from [[Arkansas]] and Texas under General [[Ben McCulloch]]. After winning victories at the [[battle of Wilson's Creek]] and the siege of [[Lexington, Missouri]] and suffering losses elsewhere, the Confederate forces retreated to Arkansas and later [[Marshall, Texas]], in the face of a largely reinforced Union Army.

Though regular Confederate troops staged some large-scale raids into Missouri, the fighting in the state for the next three years consisted chiefly of [[guerrilla warfare]]. "Citizen soldiers" or insurgents such as Captain [[William Quantrill]], [[Frank James|Frank]] and [[Jesse James]], the [[James-Younger gang|Younger brothers]], and [[William T. Anderson]] made use of quick, small-unit tactics. Pioneered by the Missouri Partisan Rangers, such insurgencies also arose in portions of the Confederacy occupied by the Union during the Civil War. Historians have portrayed stories of the James brothers' outlaw years as an American "Robin Hood" myth.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Steckmesser Kent L | year = 1966 | title = Robin Hood and the American Outlaw: A Note on History and Folklore | journal = Journal of American Folklore | volume = 79 | issue = 312| pages = 348–355 | jstor=538043| doi = 10.2307/538043 }}</ref> The vigilante activities of the [[Bald Knobbers]] of the Ozarks in the 1880s were an unofficial continuation of insurgent mentality long after the official end of the war, and they are a favorite theme in [[Branson, Missouri|Branson's self-image]].<ref>Mary Hartman and Elmo Ingenthron.

The [[Progressive Era]] (1890s to 1920s) saw numerous prominent leaders from Missouri trying to end corruption and modernize politics, government, and society. [[Joseph Folk|Joseph "Holy Joe" Folk]] was a key leader who made a strong appeal to the middle class and rural evangelical Protestants. Folk was elected governor as a progressive reformer and [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in the [[Missouri gubernatorial election, 1904|1904 election]]. He promoted what he called "the Missouri Idea", the concept of Missouri as a leader in public morality through popular control of law and strict enforcement. He successfully conducted antitrust prosecutions, ended free railroad passes for state officials, extended bribery statutes, improved election laws, required formal registration for lobbyists, made racetrack gambling illegal and enforced the Sunday-closing law. He helped enact Progressive legislation, including an initiative and referendum provision, regulation of elections, education, employment and child labor, railroads, food, business, and public utilities. Several efficiency-oriented examiner boards and commissions were established during Folk's administration, including many agricultural boards and the Missouri library commission.<ref>Steven L. Piott, ''Holy Joe: Joseph Folk and the Missouri Idea'' (1997)</ref>

Between the Civil War and the end of World War II, Missouri transitioned from a rural economy to a hybrid industrial-service-agricultural economy as the Midwest rapidly industrialized. The expansion of railroads to the West transformed Kansas City into a major transportation hub within the nation. The growth of the Texas cattle industry along with this increased rail infrastructure and the invention of the [[refrigerated boxcar]] also made Kansas City a major [[meatpacking]] center, as large [[cattle drives]] from Texas brought herds of cattle to [[Dodge City]] and other Kansas towns. There, the cattle were loaded onto trains destined for Kansas City, where they were butchered and distributed to the eastern markets. The first half of the 20th century was the height of Kansas City's prominence, and its downtown became a showcase for stylish [[Art Deco]] [[skyscrapers]] as construction boomed.

In 1930, there was a [[diphtheria]] epidemic in the area around Springfield, which killed approximately 100 people. Serum was rushed to the area, and medical personnel stopped the epidemic.

During the mid-1950s and 1960s, St. Louis and Kansas City suffered deindustrialization and loss of jobs in railroads and manufacturing, as did other [[Midwestern]] industrial cities.  [[St. Charles, Missouri|St. Charles]] claims to be the site of the first [[Interstate Highway System|interstate]] highway project in 1956.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://highways.dot.gov/public-roads/summer-1996/three-states-claim-first-interstate-highway |title=First interstate project |publisher=Fhwa.dot.gov |access-date=May 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607064752/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/rw96h.cfm |archive-date=June 7, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Such highway construction made it easy for middle-class residents to leave the city for newer housing developed in the suburbs, often former farmland where land was available at lower prices. These major cities have gone through decades of readjustment to develop different economies and adjust to demographic changes. Suburban areas have developed separate job markets, both in knowledge industries and services, such as major retail malls.

==Geography==

{{Main|Geography of Missouri}}
[[File:National-atlas-missouri.png|thumb|upright=1.5]]

Missouri borders eight different states, a figure equaled only by its neighbor, Tennessee. Missouri is bounded by [[Iowa]] on the north; by [[Illinois]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Tennessee]] across the Mississippi River on the east; on the south by [[Arkansas]]; and by [[Oklahoma]], [[Kansas]], and [[Nebraska]] (the last across the Missouri River) on the west. Whereas the northern and southern boundaries are straight lines, the [[Missouri Bootheel]] extends south between the [[St. Francis River|St. Francis]] and the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers. The two largest rivers are the Mississippi (which defines the eastern boundary of the state) and the Missouri River (which flows from west to east through the state), essentially connecting the two largest metros of Kansas City and St. Louis.

Although today it is usually considered part of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.midwest.htm |title=Midwest Region Economy at a Glance |publisher=Bls.gov |access-date=July 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917003753/http://bls.gov/eag/eag.midwest.htm |archive-date=September 17, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> Missouri was historically seen by many as a [[Border states (American Civil War)|border state]], chiefly because of the settlement of migrants from the South and its status as a slave state before the Civil War, balanced by the influence of St. Louis. The counties that made up "[[Little Dixie (Missouri)|Little Dixie]]" were those along the Missouri River in the center of the state, settled by Southern migrants who held the greatest concentration of slaves.

In 2005, Missouri received 16,695,000 visitors to its national parks and other recreational areas totaling {{convert|101000|acre|km2}}, giving it $7.41&nbsp;million in annual revenues, 26.6% of its operating expenditures.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book |title=''Almanac of the 50 States'' (Missouri) |publisher=Information Publications (Woodside, California) |year=2008 |page=203}}</ref>

===Topography===

[[File:US mo physiographic map.jpg|thumb|left|A physiographic map of Missouri]]
North of, and in some cases just south of, the Missouri River lie the Northern Plains that stretch into Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas. Here, rolling hills remain from the [[glaciation]] that once extended from the Canadian Shield to the Missouri River. Missouri has many large river bluffs along the Mississippi, Missouri, and [[Meramec River]]s. Southern Missouri rises to the [[Ozark Mountains]], a [[dissected plateau]] surrounding the [[Precambrian]] [[igneous]] [[St. Francois Mountains]]. This region also hosts [[karst topography]] characterized by high limestone content with the formation of sinkholes and caves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mostateparks.com/karst.htm |title=Missouri's Karst Wonderland—Missouri State Parks and Historic Sites, DNR |publisher=Mostateparks.com |date=June 6, 2008 |access-date=February 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228195535/http://www.mostateparks.com/karst.htm |archive-date=February 28, 2010 }}</ref>
[[File:Bell Mountain.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.6|The [[Bell Mountain Wilderness]] of southern Missouri's [[Mark Twain National Forest]]]]

The southeastern part of the state is known as the [[Missouri Bootheel]] region, which is part of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain or [[Mississippi embayment]]. This region is the lowest, flattest, warmest, and wettest part of the state. It is also among the poorest, as the economy there is mostly agricultural.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ded.mo.gov/researchandplanning/community/misc/sa-1102-1.stm |title=Income Inequality in Missouri |publisher=Ded.mo.gov |date=December 21, 2001 |access-date=July 31, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107144051/http://ded.mo.gov/researchandplanning/community/misc/sa-1102-1.stm |archive-date=January 7, 2010 }}</ref> It is also the most fertile, with cotton and rice crops predominant. The Bootheel was the epicenter of the four [[1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes|New Madrid Earthquakes of 1811 and 1812]].

===Climate===

{{Main|Climate of Missouri}}
[[File:Missouri Köppen.svg|thumb|Köppen climate types of Missouri]]

Missouri generally has a [[humid continental climate]] with cool, sometimes cold, winters and hot, humid, and wet summers. In the southern part of the state, particularly in the [[Missouri Bootheel|Bootheel]], the climate becomes [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]]. Located in the interior United States, Missouri often experiences extreme temperatures. Without high mountains or oceans nearby to moderate temperature, its climate is alternately influenced by air from the cold Arctic and the hot and humid Gulf of Mexico. Missouri's highest recorded temperature is {{convert|118|F|C}} at [[Warsaw, Missouri|Warsaw]] and [[Union, Missouri|Union]] on July 14, 1954, while the lowest recorded temperature is {{convert|-40|F|C}} also at Warsaw on February 13, 1905.

Located in [[Tornado Alley]], Missouri also receives extreme weather in the form of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. On May 22, 2011, a [[2011 Joplin tornado|massive EF-5 tornado]] killed 158 people and destroyed roughly one-third of the city of [[Joplin, Missouri|Joplin]]. The tornado caused an estimated $1–3&nbsp;billion in damages, killed 159 people and injured more than a thousand. It was the first EF5 to hit the state since 1957 and the deadliest in the U.S. since 1947, making it the seventh deadliest tornado in American history and 27th deadliest in the world. [[St. Louis]] and its suburbs also have a history of experiencing particularly severe tornadoes, the most recent one of note being an EF4 that damaged [[Lambert-St. Louis International Airport]] on April 22, 2011. [[1896 St. Louis–East St. Louis tornado|One of the worst tornadoes in American history]] struck St. Louis on May 27, 1896, killing at least 255 people and causing $10&nbsp;million in damage (equivalent to $3.9&nbsp;billion in 2009 or ${{Formatprice| {{Inflation|US|3900000000|2009|r=2}}}} in today's dollars).

North of the Missouri River, the state is primarily rolling hills of the [[Great Plains]], whereas south of the Missouri River, the state is dominated by the Oak-Hickory [[Central U.S. hardwood forest]].

===Forests===

Recreational and commercial uses of public forests, including grazing, logging, and mining, increased after World War{{spaces}}II. Fishermen, hikers, campers, and others started lobbying to protect forest areas with a "wilderness character". During the 1930s and 1940s, [[Aldo Leopold]], [[Arthur Carhart]] and [[Bob Marshall (wilderness activist)|Bob Marshall]] developed a "wilderness" policy for the Forest Service. Their efforts bore fruit with the [[Wilderness Act of 1964]], which designated wilderness areas "where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by men, where man himself is a visitor and does not remain." This included [[secondary forest|second growth]] public forests like the [[Mark Twain National Forest]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Farmer |first1=Charles J. |title=A Personal Guide to Missouri Wilderness |date=1999 |publisher=University of Missouri Press |pages=9–13}}</ref>

Missouri had a population of 5,988,927, according to the 2010 census; an increase of 137,525 (2.3 percent) since the year 2010. From 2010 to 2018, this includes a natural increase of 137,564 people since the last census (480,763 births less 343,199 deaths) and an increase of 88,088 people due to net [[Human migration|migration]] into the state. [[Immigration to the United States|Immigration]] from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 50,450 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 37,638 people.

In 2004, the population included 194,000 foreign-born people (3.4 percent of the state population).

The five largest ancestry groups in Missouri are: [[German American|German]] (27.4 percent), [[Irish American|Irish]] (14.8 percent), [[English American|English]] (10.2 percent), [[American ancestry|American]] (8.5 percent) and [[French American|French]] (3.7 percent).
[[File:Ethnic Origins in Missouri.png|thumb|Ethnic origins in Missouri]]
German Americans are an ancestry group present throughout Missouri. African Americans are a substantial part of the population in St. Louis (56.6% of African Americans in the state lived in [[St. Louis]] or [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]] as of the 2010 census), Kansas City, Boone County and in the southeastern Bootheel and some parts of the Missouri River Valley, where plantation agriculture was once important. Missouri [[Creole peoples|Creoles]] of French ancestry are concentrated in the [[Mississippi River Valley]] south of St. Louis (see [[Missouri French]]). Kansas City is home to large and growing immigrant communities from Latin America esp. [[Mexico]] and [[Colombia]], Africa (i.e. [[Sudan]], Somalia and [[Nigeria]]), and Southeast Asia including China and the [[Philippines]]; and Europe like the former [[Yugoslavia]] (see [[Bosnian American]]). A notable [[Cherokee]] Indian population exists in Missouri, and 30,518 identified as being Native American alone in 2020, while 152,917 did in combination with one or more other races.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Race and Ethnicity in the United States: 2010 Census and 2020 Census |url=https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/race-and-ethnicity-in-the-united-state-2010-and-2020-census.html}}</ref>

* Since 2016, data for births of [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|White Hispanic]] origin are not collected, but included in one ''Hispanic'' group; persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race.

===Language===

The vast majority of people in Missouri speak English. Approximately 5.1% of the population reported speaking a language other than English at home. The Spanish language is spoken in small Latino communities in the St. Louis and Kansas City Metro areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambio.missouri.edu/Library/Publications/2006-08CambioDeColoresAbstractsBookWEB.pdf|title=Latinos in Missouri|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525203034/http://www.cambio.missouri.edu/Library/Publications/2006-08CambioDeColoresAbstractsBookWEB.pdf|archive-date=May 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Missouri is home to an endangered dialect of the French language known as [[Missouri French]]. Speakers of the dialect, who call themselves ''[[Creole peoples|Créoles]]'', are descendants of the French pioneers who settled the area then known as the [[Illinois Country]] beginning in the late 17th century. It developed in isolation from French speakers in Canada and [[Louisiana]], becoming quite distinct from the varieties of [[Canadian French]] and [[Louisiana French]]. Once widely spoken throughout the area, Missouri French is now nearly extinct, with only a few elderly speakers able to use it.<ref name= Ammon>{{cite book|title= Status and Function of Languages and Language Varieties|last1= Ammon|first1= Ulrich|year= 1989|publisher= Walter de Gruyter|isbn= 978-0-89925-356-5|pages= 306–8|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=geh261xgI8sC|access-date= September 3, 2010|archive-date= December 20, 2012|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121220231510/http://books.google.com/books?id=geh261xgI8sC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0|url-status= live}}; International Sociological Association.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Carrière|first1= J-M|year= 1939|title= Creole Dialect of Missouri |journal=American Speech |volume= 14 |issue= 2|pages= 109–19|jstor= 451217|doi=10.2307/451217}}</ref>

According to the Missouri Partnership, Missouri's agriculture industry contributes $33&nbsp;billion in GDP to Missouri's economy, and generates $88&nbsp;billion in sales and more than 378,000 jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missouripartnership.com/industry-strengths/global-agtech-leader/|title=Missouri Partnership {{!}} Economic Development {{!}} Global Agtech Leader|website=www.missouripartnership.com|access-date=May 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525202724/http://www.missouripartnership.com/industry-strengths/global-agtech-leader/|archive-date=May 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Missouri has vast quantities of [[limestone]]. Other resources mined are lead, coal, and crushed [[Rock (geology)|stone]]. Missouri produces the most lead of all the states. Most of the lead mines are in the [[Lead Belt|central eastern portion]] of the state. Missouri also ranks first or near first in the production of [[Lime (mineral)|lime]], a key ingredient in [[Portland cement]].

Missouri also has a growing science, agricultural technology, and biotechnology field. [[Monsanto]], formerly one of the largest biotech companies in America, was based in [[St. Louis]] until it was acquired by [[Bayer AG]] in 2018. It is now part of the Crop Science Division of [[Bayer Corporation]], Bayer's U.S. subsidiary.

Tourism, services, and wholesale/retail trade follow manufacturing in importance—tourism benefits from the many rivers, lakes, caves, parks, etc., throughout the state. In addition to a network of state parks, Missouri is home to [[Gateway Arch National Park]] in St. Louis and the [[Ozark National Scenic Riverways]]. A much-visited show cave is [[Meramec Caverns]] in [[Stanton, Missouri|Stanton]].

===Taxation===
{{main|Taxation in Missouri}}
Personal [[Income tax|income]] is taxed in ten different earning brackets, ranging from 1.5% to 6.0%. Missouri's [[sales tax]] rate for most items is 4.225%, with some additional local levies. More than 2,500 Missouri local governments rely on [[property tax]]es levied on real property (real estate) and [[personal property]].

Most personal property is exempt, except for motorized vehicles. Exempt real estate includes property owned by governments and property used as nonprofit cemeteries, exclusively for religious worship, for schools and colleges, and purely charitable purposes. There is no [[inheritance tax]] and limited Missouri [[estate tax]] related to [[Estate tax (United States)|federal estate tax]] collection.

In 2017, the Tax Foundation rated Missouri as having the 5th-best corporate tax index,<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://taxfoundation.org/2017-state-business-tax-climate-index|title=2017 State Business Tax Climate Index—Tax Foundation|date=September 28, 2016|work=Tax Foundation|access-date=May 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516153755/https://taxfoundation.org/2017-state-business-tax-climate-index|archive-date=May 16, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> and the 15th-best overall tax climate.<ref name=":0" /> Missouri's corporate income tax rate is 6.25%; however, 50% of federal income tax payments may be deducted before computing taxable income, leading to an effective rate of 5.2%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missouripartnership.com/prime-business-location/low-business-costs/|title=Missouri Partnership {{!}} Economic Development {{!}} Location {{!}} Low Business Costs|website=missouripartnership.com|access-date=May 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525213301/http://www.missouripartnership.com/prime-business-location/low-business-costs/|archive-date=May 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Two of the nation's three busiest rail centers are in Missouri. [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] is a major railroad hub for [[BNSF Railway]], [[Norfolk Southern Railway]], [[Kansas City Southern Railway]], and [[Union Pacific Railroad]], and every class{{nbsp}}1 railroad serves Missouri. Kansas City is the second-largest freight rail center in the U.S. (but is first in the amount of tonnage handled). Like Kansas City, St. Louis is a major destination for train freight. Springfield remains an operational hub for BNSF Railway.

[[Amtrak]] passenger trains serve [[Union Station (Kansas City, Missouri)|Kansas City]], [[La Plata (Amtrak station)|La Plata]], [[Jefferson City station|Jefferson City]], [[Gateway Multimodal Transportation Center|St. Louis]], [[Lee's Summit, Missouri|Lee's Summit]], [[Independence (Amtrak station)|Independence]], [[Warrensburg, Missouri|Warrensburg]], [[Hermann, Missouri|Hermann]], [[Washington, Missouri|Washington]], Kirkwood, [[Sedalia, Missouri|Sedalia]], and [[Poplar Bluff, Missouri|Poplar Bluff]].

The only urban light rail/subway system operating in Missouri is [[MetroLink (St. Louis)|MetroLink]], which connects the city of St. Louis with suburbs in Illinois and St. Louis County. It is one of the largest systems (by track mileage) in the United States. The [[KC Streetcar]] in downtown Kansas City opened in May 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kcstreetcar.org/about-kc-streetcar.htm |title=KC Streetcar—About KC Streetcar |access-date=October 27, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200707/http://kcstreetcar.org/about-kc-streetcar.htm |archive-date=October 29, 2013 }}</ref>

The [[Gateway Multimodal Transportation Center]] in St. Louis is the largest active multi-use transportation center in the state. It is in downtown St. Louis, next to the historic [[Union Station (St. Louis)|Union Station]] complex. It serves as a hub center/station for MetroLink, the [[St. Louis MetroBus|MetroBus]] regional bus system, [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]], Amtrak, and taxi services.

In 2018, a [[Missouri Hyperloop]] was proposed to connect St. Louis, Kansas City, and Columbia, reducing travel time across the entire state to around a half hour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/01/30/missouri-ready-700-mph-commutes/1078842001/|title=Is Missouri ready for 700 mph hyperloop commutes?|website=USA Today|last=della Cava|first=Marco|date=January 30, 2018|access-date=March 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328225952/https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/01/30/missouri-ready-700-mph-commutes/1078842001/|archive-date=March 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The project stalled in December, 2023, with the shutdown of the corporate partner [[Hyperloop One]].

Many cities have regular fixed-route systems, and many rural counties have rural public transit services. [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] and [[Trailways]] provide inter-city bus service in Missouri. [[Megabus (North America)|Megabus]] serves St. Louis, but discontinued service to Columbia and Kansas City in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title = Megabus canceling service in Kansas City, Columbia|url = http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article35600877.html|website = kansascity|access-date = January 18, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160201133341/http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article35600877.html|archive-date = February 1, 2016|url-status = live}}</ref>

===Rivers===

The Mississippi River and Missouri River are commercially navigable over their entire lengths in Missouri. The Missouri was channelized through dredging and jetties, and the Mississippi was given a series of [[lock (water transport)|locks]] and dams to avoid rocks and deepen the river. St. Louis is a major destination for barge traffic on the Mississippi.

The Constitution of Missouri, the fourth constitution for the state, was adopted in 1945. It provides for three branches of government: the legislative, judicial, and executive branches. The legislative branch consists of two bodies: the [[Missouri House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[Missouri Senate|Senate]]. These bodies comprise the [[Missouri General Assembly]].

The House of Representatives has 163 members apportioned based on the last [[United States Census|decennial census]]. The Senate consists of 34 members from districts of approximately equal populations. The judicial department comprises the [[Supreme Court of Missouri]], which has seven judges, the [[Missouri Court of Appeals]] (an intermediate [[appellate court]] divided into three districts), sitting in Kansas City, St. Louis, and Springfield, and 45 Circuit Courts which function as local trial courts. The executive branch is headed by the [[List of Governors of Missouri|Governor of Missouri]] and includes five other statewide elected offices. Following the departure from office of State Auditor [[Nicole Galloway]] on January 9, 2023, there are no Democrats holding statewide elected positions in Missouri.<ref>[https://www.kcur.org/politics-elections-and-government/2023-01-09/scott-fitzpatrick-sworn-in-as-missouri-auditor-vows-to-monitor-school-spending "Scott Fitzpatrick sworn in as Missouri Auditor, vows to monitor school spending"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230110135817/https://www.kcur.org/politics-elections-and-government/2023-01-09/scott-fitzpatrick-sworn-in-as-missouri-auditor-vows-to-monitor-school-spending |date=January 10, 2023 }}, [[KCUR]], January 9, 2023</ref>

===Former status as a political bellwether===

{{Main|Missouri bellwether}}
{{further|Political party strength in Missouri}}

Missouri was widely regarded as a bellwether in American politics, often making it a [[swing state]]. The state had a longer stretch of supporting the winning presidential candidate than any other state, having voted with the nation in every election from 1904 to 2004 with a single exception: [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]] when Democratic candidate [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] of neighboring Illinois lost the election despite carrying Missouri. However, in recent years, areas of the state outside Kansas City, St. Louis, and Columbia have shifted heavily to the right, making Missouri a safe Republican state on the whole. The last Democrat to win the state's electoral votes was [[1996 United States presidential election in Missouri|Bill Clinton in 1996]]. It rejected Democrat [[Barack Obama]] of neighboring Illinois in both of his successful campaigns in 2008 and 2012. Missouri voted for [[Mitt Romney]] by nearly 10% in 2012 and voted for [[Donald Trump]] by over 18% in 2016 and 15% in 2020.

On October 24, 2012, there were 4,190,936 registered voters.<ref name="registered">{{cite web |url=http://www.sos.mo.gov/elections/registeredvoters.asp?rvmID=0012 |title=Registered Voters in Missouri 2012 |publisher=Missouri Secretary of State |date=October 24, 2012 |access-date=October 28, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025023240/http://www.sos.mo.gov/elections/registeredvoters.asp?rvmID=0012 |archive-date=October 25, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> At the state level, both Democratic Senator [[Claire McCaskill]] and Democratic Governor [[Jay Nixon]] were re-elected.

On November 3, 2020, there were 4,318,758 registered voters, with 3,026,028 voting (70.1%).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sos.mo.gov/CMSImages/ElectionResultStatistics/Nov2020OfficialVoterTurnout.pdf |title=Voter Turnout Report: 2020 General Election |publisher=Missouri Secretary of State |date=December 8, 2020 |access-date=June 14, 2021 }}{{Dead link|date=December 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  By this time, the state had favored more Republican candidates for federal offices.  The offices held by Democratic party officials a decade before were subsequently held by Republican Senator [[Josh Hawley]] and Republican Governor [[Mike Parson]].

Missouri's accuracy rate for the last 29 presidential elections is now 89.66%. This percentage is on par with that of Ohio, which has voted for the winner of every presidential election since 1896, except in [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]], [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]] and [[2020 United States presidential election|2020]], with no Republican ever winning the White House without the state.

===Laissez-faire alcohol and tobacco laws===

{{Main|Alcohol laws of Missouri|List of smoking bans in the United States#Missouri}}

Missouri has been known for its population's generally "stalwart, conservative, noncredulous" attitude toward regulatory regimes, which is one of the origins of the state's unofficial nickname, the "Show-Me State".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/history/slogan.asp |title=Missouri Secretary of State—State Archives—Origin of "Show Me" slogan |publisher=Sos.mo.gov |access-date=July 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724211551/http://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/history/slogan.asp |archive-date=July 24, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> As a result, and combined with the fact that Missouri is one of America's leading alcohol states, regulation of alcohol and tobacco in Missouri is among the most [[laissez-faire]] in America. For 2013, the annual "Freedom in the 50 States" study prepared by the [[Mercatus Center]] at [[George Mason University]] ranked Missouri as #3 in America for alcohol freedom and #1 for tobacco freedom (#7 for freedom overall).<ref name=gmufreedom>{{cite web |url=http://freedominthe50states.org/overall/missouri |title=''Freedom in the 50 States-Missouri'' |author=Mercatus Center |date=March 28, 2013 |website=Freedom in the 50 States |publisher=[[George Mason University]] |access-date=March 29, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407162026/http://freedominthe50states.org/overall/missouri |archive-date=April 7, 2013 |url-status=live |author-link=Mercatus Center }}</ref> The study notes that Missouri's "alcohol regime is one of the least restrictive in the United States, with no [[blue laws]] and taxes well below average", and that "Missouri ranks best in the nation on tobacco freedom".<ref name=gmufreedom />

Missouri law makes it "an improper employment practice" for an employer to refuse to hire, to fire, or otherwise to disadvantage any person because that person lawfully uses alcohol or tobacco products outside of work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moga.mo.gov/statutes/C200-299/2900000145.HTM |title=Mo.

With a large German immigrant population and the development of a brewing industry, Missouri always has had among the most permissive [[alcohol laws of the United States by state|alcohol laws in the United States]]. It has never enacted statewide [[prohibition in the United States|prohibition]]. Missouri voters rejected prohibition in three separate referendums in 1910, 1912, and 1918. Alcohol regulation did not begin in Missouri until 1934.

Today, alcohol laws are controlled by the state government, and local jurisdictions are prohibited from going beyond those state laws. Missouri has no statewide [[United States open container laws|open container law]] or prohibition on [[drinking in public]], no alcohol-related [[blue law]]s, no [[local option]], no precise locations for selling liquor by the package (allowing even [[drug store]]s and [[filling station]]s to sell any kind of liquor), and no differentiation of laws based on alcohol percentage. State law protects persons from arrest or criminal penalty for [[public intoxication]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moga.mo.gov/statutes/C000-099/0670000305.HTM |title=Mo. Rev.

===Cannabis laws===

{{See also|Cannabis in Missouri}}

In 2014, a Republican-led legislature and Democratic governor [[Jay Nixon]] enacted a series of laws to partially decriminalize possession of cannabis by making first-time possession of up to 10 grams no longer punishable with jail time and legalizing [[Cannabidiol|CBD]] oil. In November 2018, [[Cannabis in Missouri|66% of voters approved]] a constitutional amendment that established a right to medical marijuana and a system for licensing, regulating, and taxing medical marijuana.

===Missouri State Board of Education===

The [[Missouri State Board of Education]] has general authority over all public education in the state of Missouri. It is made up of eight citizens appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Missouri Senate.

===Primary and secondary schools===

{{See also|List of school districts in Missouri|List of high schools in Missouri}}

Education is compulsory from ages seven to seventeen. It is required that any parent, guardian, or another person with custody of a child between the ages of seven and seventeen, the compulsory attendance age for the district, must ensure the child is enrolled in and regularly attends public, private, parochial school, home school or a combination of schools for the full term of the school year. Compulsory attendance also ends when children complete sixteen credits in high school.

Children in Missouri between the ages of five and seven are not required to be enrolled in school. However, if they are enrolled in a public school, their parent, guardian, or custodian must ensure they regularly attend.

Missouri schools are commonly but not exclusively divided into three tiers of primary and secondary education: elementary school, [[middle school]] or [[junior high school]] and high school. The public school system includes kindergarten to 12th grade. District territories are often complex in structure. In some cases, elementary, middle, and junior high schools of a single district feed into high schools in another district. As another example, special education and related services for students in the twenty-two school districts of St. Louis County are provided by staff employed by a special school district, a local education agency that serves students county-wide. High school athletics and competitions are governed by the [[Missouri State High School Activities Association]] (MSHSAA).

[[Homeschooling]] is legal in Missouri and is an option to meet the compulsory education requirement. It is neither monitored nor regulated by the state's Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.<ref>{{cite web |author=Missouri Department Of Elementary And Secondary Education |url=http://www.dese.mo.gov/schoollaw/HomeSch/ |title=Home Schooling |publisher=Dese.mo.gov |date=September 2, 2009 |access-date=February 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514195922/http://dese.mo.gov/schoollaw/HomeSch/ |archive-date=May 14, 2011 }}</ref>

The [[University of Missouri System]] is Missouri's statewide public university system. The flagship institution and largest university in the state is the [[University of Missouri]] in [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]]. The others in the system are [[University of Missouri–Kansas City]], [[University of Missouri–St. Louis]], and [[Missouri University of Science and Technology]] in [[Rolla, Missouri|Rolla]].

During the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the state established a series of [[normal school]]s in each region of the state, originally named after the geographic districts: Northeast Missouri State University (now [[Truman State University]]) (1867), Central Missouri State University (now the [[University of Central Missouri]]) (1871), [[Southeast Missouri State University]] (1873), Southwest Missouri State University (now [[Missouri State University]]) (1905), [[Northwest Missouri State University]] (1905), [[Missouri Western State University]] (1915), [[Maryville University]] (1872) and [[Missouri Southern State University]] (1937). [[Lincoln University (Missouri)|Lincoln University]] and [[Harris–Stowe State University]] were established in the mid-nineteenth century and are [[historically black colleges and universities]].

Among private institutions [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and [[Saint Louis University]] are two top ranked schools in the US.<ref>"[http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/t1natudoc_brief.php America's Best Colleges 2008: National Universities: Top Schools.]" USNews.com: .

[[A.T. Still University]] was the first [[osteopathic]] medical school in the world. [[Hannibal–LaGrange University]] in Hannibal, Missouri, was one of the first colleges west of the Mississippi (founded 1858 in LaGrange, Missouri, and moved to Hannibal in 1928).<ref>{{cite web |author=Don Colborn, PhD |url=http://www.hlg.edu/newsinfo/about.php |title=HLGU—About HLG |publisher=Hlg.edu |access-date=December 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122153408/http://www.hlg.edu/newsinfo/about.php |archive-date=November 22, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The state funds a $3000, renewable merit-based scholarship, [[Bright Flight (Missouri scholarship)|Bright Flight]], given to the top three percent of Missouri high school graduates who attend a university in-state.

The 19th-century border wars between Missouri and Kansas have continued as a sports rivalry between the [[University of Missouri]] and [[University of Kansas]]. The rivalry was chiefly expressed through football and basketball games between the two universities, but since Missouri left the [[Big 12 Conference]] in 2012, the teams no longer regularly play one another. It was the oldest college rivalry west of the [[Mississippi River]] and the second-oldest in the nation. Each year when the universities met to play, the game was coined the "Border War". Following the game, an exchange occurred where the winner took a historic Indian War Drum, which had been passed back and forth for decades. Though Missouri and Kansas no longer have an annual game after the University of Missouri moved to the [[Southeastern Conference]], rivalry still exists between them.
