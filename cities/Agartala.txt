== Etymology ==
Agartala is a derivative of two words, namely ''[[Agarwood|agar]]'', a valuable perfume and incense tree of genus [[Aquilaria]], and the suffix ''tala'', meaning ''underneath,'' a reference to the density of agarwood trees in the region.{{citation needed|date= September 2022}} The agar tree is historically referred to in the story of the King Raghu who tied up his elephant's feet to an agar tree on the banks of River Lauhitya.{{citation needed|date= September 2022}}

==History==
[[File:Maharaja bir bikram manikya.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bir Bikram Kishore Debbarman]], one of the most ambitious kings of Tripura]]

One of the earliest kings of Tripura was Patardan B.C. 1900, long before the [[Manikya Dynasty]]. According to folklore, Chitrarath, Drikpati, Dharmapha, Loknath Jivandharan were important kings during the time of B.C. in Agartala.{{citation needed|date= September 2022}}<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Deb Barman |first=Debapriya |date=11 October 1983 |title=Treatise on Traditional Social Institutions of the Tripuri Community |url=https://trci.tripura.gov.in/sites/default/files/Treatise_on_Traditional_Social_Institutions_of_the_Tripuri_Community.pdf |journal=Directorate of Research, Department of Welfare of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes, Government of Tripura |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=122}}</ref>

In the past, Tripura served as the capital to several [[Hinduism|Hindu]] kingdoms. Although a timeline of the rulers has not been found, records reveal that the area has been ruled by as many as 179 Hindu rulers, starting from the mythological King Druhya to the last King of Tripura, Kirit Bikram Kishore Manikya. Tripura also came under [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule. The state came under the governance of the British in 1808.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iloveindia.com/travel/agartala/history-of-agartala.html |title=History Of Agartala|access-date=3 August 2019}}</ref>

Much later the ancient capital of the then [[princely state]] 'Swadhin Tripura' was at Rangamati (Udaipur, South Tripura) by the bank of the river Gomati. In 1760 it was shifted by the Maharaja Krishna Chandra Manikya Bahadur (r.1829–1849) of Manikya Dynasty<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uq.net.au/~zzhsoszy/ips/t/tripura.html |title=UQconnect, The University of Queensland |publisher=Uq.net.au |access-date=2 February 2014}}</ref> to present old Agartala by the bank of the river [[Haora River|Haora]]/Saidra and was named 'Haveli'. Due to frequent invasion of the [[Kuki peoples|Kukis]] and also to keep easy communication with the British Bengali, the Maharaja Krishna Chandra Manikya started the process of shifting the capital from Old Haveli to New Haveli (present Agartala) in 1849.{{citation needed|date= September 2022}}

During the [[British Raj]], Agartala was the capital of the '[[Hill Tippera]]' state; it became a municipality in 1874–75, and in 1901 had a population of 9,513.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Imperial Gazetteer2 of India, Volume 5, page 70 -- Imperial Gazetteer of India -- Digital South Asia Library|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V05_078.gif|access-date=10 March 2022|website=dsal.uchicago.edu}}</ref> The princely state always remained as cake piece to the British and many other invaders. For example, when Arakhan soldiers attacked the old capital of the state the king of Tripura responded by defeating the entire troop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iloveindia.com/travel/agartala/history-of-agartala.html |title=History Of Agartala{{Snd}} Agartala History |publisher=Iloveindia.com |access-date=20 December 2013}}</ref>
The Agartala Municipality was established during the reign of Maharaja [[Bir Chandra Manikya]] (1862–1896) within an area of {{convert|3|sqmi|km2|sigfig=1}} having a population of only 875 by a royal proclamation in the last part of 1871. A.W.S. Power, the first British political agent for [[Tripura (princely state)|Tipperah]] was also appointed as the Chairman of the Agartala Municipality in 1872 who held office from 1872 to 1873. The municipality located at the crossing of latitude N 23 –50' and longitude E 91-17' covering 3&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> area during that period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://agartalacity.nic.in |title=Agartala Municipal Council |publisher=Agartalacity.nic.in |access-date=20 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012171715/http://agartalacity.nic.in/ |archive-date=12 October 2017 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

[[Bir Bikram Manikya Debbarma]] is called the founder of the planned city of Agartala. He had gone on a tour to the [[United Kingdom]] and was so impressed at the architecture that he started planning similar township in Agartala. During the 1940s the town was re-organised in a planned manner with new roads and a market building.{{citation needed|date= September 2022}}

The estimated population of Agartala was 5,22,603 in 2014 after the municipal expansion<ref>[http://tripura.nic.in/amc/amcdetails.doc Agartala Municipality Statistics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504004126/http://tripura.nic.in/amc/amcdetails.doc |date=4 May 2006 }}, provided by the ''AMC''([[Agartala Municipal Council]]) at the ''Government of Tripura website''</ref> (189,327 in the 2001 census).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510061218/http://www.censusindia.gov.in/|url-status=dead|title=Census of India Website : Office of the Registrar General & Census Commissioner, India|archive-date=10 May 2006|website=www.censusindia.gov.in|access-date=10 December 2019}}</ref>

From 1901 to 1971 the city did not experience notable progress in infrastructure development with only an 8&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of area but 1981 saw Agartala expanding and increasing its connectivity as well as businesses in various fields, the city area expanding to 58.84&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, greater Agartala is planned as of 2011 with an additional of 92&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Agartala had a different type of history from the earlier times of the epic days as it was a princely state and was connected with Bangladesh. Though the [[East India Company]] had not arrived in the princely capital of the state but they always remained in a certain in capturing and ruling. The East India Company had set their base of North East India in the Assam province with [[Shillong]] as their capital.{{citation needed|date= September 2022}}

Indian Nobel laureate and poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]] visited the city multiple times and built a house that still exists. The historical book Rajmala contains incidents and historical stories of Agartala.{{citation needed|date= September 2022}}

==Geography and climate==

Agartala is situated on a plain land along the [[Haora River]], although the city also extends to the low-lying hills on its northern parts.{{citation needed|date= September 2022}}

Agartala has a monsoon influenced [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cwa'') just short of being hot enough to qualify as a borderline [[tropical savanna climate|tropical savanna]] (''Aw'')/[[tropical monsoon climate|tropical monsoon]] (''Am'') climate. Large amounts of rain fall all year except during the dry "winter" or "cool" season. The city experiences long, hot and wet summers, lasting from April to October. Average temperatures are around {{convert|28|C|F|1|disp=or}}, fluctuating with rainfall. There is a short, mild winter from mid-November to early March, with mostly dry conditions and average temperatures around {{convert|18|C|F}}. The best time to visit is from September to February.

{{See|Meitei people in Tripura}}
The city mainly consists of [[Bengali people|Bengalis]] and [[Tripuri people|Tripuris]]. Bengali is widely spoken in the city as a result of the erstwhile regal patronage and high influx of Bengalis from [[Comilla]], [[Sylhet]], [[Noakhali District|Noakhali]], and [[Chittagong District|Chittagong districts]] of Bangladesh. [[Durga Puja]] and [[Saraswati Puja]] are celebrated with great grandeur and ecstatic enthusiasm, which reflect the influence of the culture of the Bengalis. Hence, nearly every festivity attracts participation from citizens of diverse backgrounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelomy.com |title=Travel Guide for South Asia: India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives |publisher=Travelomy |access-date=2 February 2014}}</ref>

==Politics==

On 1 November 1956, Tripura became a [[Union Territory]] and an Advisory Committee was formed to advise the [[Chief Commissioner]]. On 15 August 1957, a Territorial Council was formed with 30 elected members and two members nominated by the [[government of India]]. On 1 July 1963, the Tripura Territorial Council was dissolved and a Legislative Assembly with the existing members of the Territorial Council was formed. Tripura is governed through a [[parliamentary system]] of [[representative democracy]], a feature it shares with other Indian states. [[Universal suffrage]] is granted to residents. The Tripura government has three branches: executive, legislature and judiciary. The [[Tripura Legislative Assembly]] consists of elected members and special office bearers that are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the speaker, or by the deputy speaker in the case of the speaker's absence. The Assembly is [[unicameral]] with 60 [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|members of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLA).<ref name="60mla">

After the independence of India in 1947 Tripura was still a princely state. After the death of the last king [[Bir Bikram Kishore Debbarman Manikya Bahadur|Maharaja Bir Bikram Kishore Manikya]] Bahadur on 17 May 1947, a Regency Council was formed headed by Maharani [[Kanchan Prava Devi]], for aid of the minor Prince, Kirit Bikram Kishore Manikya Bahadur. The regent signed the merger agreement with the government of India. After the merger Tripura became a Part 'C' state. On reorganisation of the states, effected in November 1956, Tripura became a Union Territory with an Advisory Committee to aid and advise the chief commissioner. Tripura gained its statehood on 21 January 1972 before that but merging with India in 1949 the first chief minister of the state was on 1 July 1963, [[Sachindra Lal Singh]] of the [[Indian National Congress]], he was the CM of the state for around 3,046 days. From 5 January 1978 the rule of the Congress came to an end as [[Nripen Chakraborty]] became the first [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)|communist]] chief minister of Tripura. Later again the communists fell and the [[Indian National Congress|INC]] rose and was in power till 1992, from 1993 again [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)|CPI (M)]] came to power. [[Manik Sarkar]] was the CM of the state from 11 March 1998 to March 2018. In [[2018 Tripura Legislative Assembly election]] BJP won 36 out of 59 seats, defeating CPI(M) in the process. BJP's [[Biplab Kumar Deb]] was sworn in as the chief minister of Tripura.{{citation needed|date= September 2022}}
