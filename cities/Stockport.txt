'''Stockport''' is a town in [[Greater Manchester]], England, {{convert|8|mi|km|0}} south-east of [[Manchester]], {{convert|9|mi|km|0}} south-west of [[Ashton-under-Lyne]] and {{convert|12|mi|km|0}} north of [[Macclesfield]]. The [[River Goyt|Rivers Goyt]] and [[River Tame, Greater Manchester|Tame]] merge to create the [[River Mersey]] here. It is the main settlement of the wider [[Metropolitan Borough of Stockport]]. 

Most of the town is within the boundaries of the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[Cheshire]], with the area north of the Mersey in the historic county of [[Lancashire]]. Stockport in the 16th century was a small town entirely on the south bank of the Mersey, known for the cultivation of [[hemp]] and manufacture of [[rope]]. In the 18th century, it had one of the first mechanised silk factories in the [[British Isles]]. Stockport's predominant industries of the 19th century were the cotton and allied industries. It was also at the centre of the country's hatting industry, which by 1884 was exporting more than six million hats a year; the last hat works in Stockport closed in 1997. The town's football club, [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]], is nicknamed The Hatters.

Dominating the western approaches to the town is [[Stockport Viaduct]]. Built in 1840, its 27 brick arches carry the mainline railway passing through the town over the River Mersey.

==History==
[[File:Confluenceoftameandgoyt.JPG|thumb|right|The River Tame (left) and the River Goyt (right) meeting to form the Mersey]]

===Toponymy===
Stockport was recorded as "Stokeport" in 1170.{{sfnp|Arrowsmith|1997|p=23|ps=}}{{sfnp|Mills|1997|p=|ps=}} The currently accepted etymology is [[Old English]] ''port'', a market place, with ''stoc'', a hamlet (but more accurately a minor settlement within an estate); hence, a market place at a hamlet.{{sfnp|Arrowsmith|1997|p=23|ps=}}{{sfnp|Mills|1997|p=|ps=}} Older derivations include ''stock'', a stockaded place or castle, with ''port'', a wood, hence a castle in a wood.<ref name=SMBClocalhistory>{{citation |url=http://www.stockport.gov.uk/content/communitypeopleliving/historyandheritage/localhistory/?a=5441 |title=Local History |access-date=2 April 2007 |work=[[Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council|Stockport MBC web pages]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618070322/http://www.stockport.gov.uk/content/communitypeopleliving/historyandheritage/localhistory/?a=5441 |archive-date=18 June 2006}}</ref> The castle probably refers to [[Stockport Castle]], a 12th-century [[Motte-and-bailey castle|motte-and-bailey]] first mentioned in 1173.<ref name="Pastscape">{{PastScape|mnumber=1085399 |mname=Stockport Castle|access-date=5 January 2008|mode=cs2}}</ref>

Other derivations are based on early variants such as Stopford and Stockford. There is evidence that a ford across the Mersey existed at the foot of Bridge Street Brow. Stopford retains a use in the adjectival form, Stopfordian, for Stockport-related items, and pupils of [[Stockport Grammar School]] style themselves Stopfordians.<ref name="Ref_">{{cite web |url=http://www.stockportgrammar.co.uk/index.php?menuitem_id=219 |title=Stockport Grammar School: Old Stopfordians' Association |access-date=3 April 2007 |publisher=Stockport Grammar School |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404053929/http://www.stockportgrammar.co.uk/index.php?menuitem_id=219 |archive-date=4 April 2008}}</ref> Stopfordian is used as the general term, or [[demonym]] used for people from Stockport, much as someone from London would be a Londoner.

Stockport has never been a sea or river port as the Mersey is not navigable here; in the centre of Stockport the river has been [[culvert]]ed and the main shopping street, Merseyway, built above it.

===Early history===
The earliest evidence of human occupation in the wider area are [[microlith]]s from the hunter-gatherers of the [[Mesolithic]] period (the Middle Stone Age, about 8000–3500&nbsp;BC) and weapons and [[stone tool]]s from the [[Neolithic]] period (the New Stone Age, 3500–2000&nbsp;BC). Early Bronze Age (2000–1200&nbsp;BC) remains include stone hammers, flint knives, [[palstave]]s (bronze axe heads), and funerary [[urn]]s; all finds were chance discoveries, not the results of systematic searches of a known site. There is a gap in the age of finds between about 1200&nbsp;BC and the start of the Roman period in about 70&nbsp;AD, which may indicate depopulation, possibly due to a poorer climate.{{sfnp|Arrowsmith|1997|pp=9–14|ps=}}

Despite a strong local tradition, there is little evidence of a Roman military station at Stockport.{{sfnp|Arrowsmith|1997|pp=18–19|ps=}}{{sfnp|Dent|1977|p=1|ps=}} It is assumed that roads from [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]] to [[Ardotalia]] (Melandra) and Manchester to [[Buxton]] crossed close to the town centre. The preferred site is at a ford over the Mersey, known to be paved in the 18th century, but it has never been proved that this or any roads in the area are Roman. Hegginbotham reported (in 1892) the discovery of Roman mosaics at Castle Hill (around Stockport market) in the late 18th century, during the construction of a mill, but noted it was "founded on tradition only"; substantial stonework has never been dated by modern methods. However, Roman coins and pottery were probably found there during the 18th century. A cache of coins dating from 375 to 378&nbsp;AD may have come from the banks of the Mersey at Daw Bank; these were possibly buried for safekeeping at the side of a road.{{sfnp|Arrowsmith|1997|pp=18–19|ps=}}

Six coins from the reigns of the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Kingdom of England|English Kings]] [[Edmund I|Edmund]] (reigned 939–946) and [[Eadred]] (reigned 946–955) were found during ploughing at Reddish Green in 1789.{{sfnp|Arrowsmith|1997|p=23|ps=}}{{sfnp|Morris|1983|pp=13–15|ps=:"...&nbsp;foolhardy to attempt any historical interpretation of the pre-10th century evidence. (it) could represent an isolated incident."}} There are contrasting views about the significance of this; Arrowsmith takes this as evidence for the existence of a settlement at that time, but Morris states the find could be "an isolated incident". The small cache is the only Anglo-Saxon find in the area.{{sfnp|Arrowsmith|1997|p=23|ps=}} However, the etymology ''Stoc-port'' suggests inhabitation during this period.{{sfnp|Dent|1977|pp=1–2|ps=}}

===Medieval and early modern period===
[[File:Three Shires - geograph.org.uk - 1507074.jpg|thumb|right|The Three Shires, built in 1580, now TPD Wealth Management Ltd.]]
No part of Stockport appears in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086. The area north of the Mersey was part of the [[Hundred (county division)|hundred]] of Salford, which was poorly surveyed. The area south of the Mersey was part of the [[Hundreds of Cheshire|Hamestan]] hundred. [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]], [[Bramhall]], [[Bredbury]], and Romiley are mentioned, but these all lay just outside the town limits. The survey includes valuations of the Salford hundred as a whole and [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]] for the times of [[Edward the Confessor]], just before the [[Norman Conquest|Norman invasion of 1066]], and the time of the survey. The reduction in value is taken as evidence of destruction by [[William the Conqueror]]'s men in the campaigns generally known as the [[Harrying of the North]]. The omission of Stockport was once taken as evidence that destruction was so complete that a survey was not needed.{{sfnp|Husain|1973|p=12|ps=}}

Arrowsmith argues from the etymology that Stockport may have still been a market place associated with a larger estate, and so would not be surveyed separately. The Anglo-Saxon landholders in the area were dispossessed and the land divided amongst the new Norman rulers. <!--the [[Norman Conquest]], it was ruled by a hereditary [[Baron]] of Stockport.--> The first borough [[charter]] was granted in about 1220 and was the only basis for local government for six hundred years. <!--cite it-->

A castle held by Geoffrey de Costentin is recorded as a rebel stronghold against [[Henry II of England|Henry&nbsp;II]] in 1173–1174 when [[Revolt of 1173–1174|his sons revolted]]. There is an incorrect local tradition that Geoffrey was the king's son, [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany]], who was one of the rebels.<ref name="Ref_e">See {{Harvnb|Dent|1977}} for the traditional view; and {{Harvnb|Arrowsmith|1997|p=31}} for the refutation.</ref> Dent gives the size of the castle as about {{convert|31|by|60|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and suggests it was similar in pattern to those at [[Pontefract Castle|Pontefract]] and [[Launceston Castle|Launceston]].

A branch of the [[Arden family]] (to which [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] is related on his [[Mary Shakespeare|mother's]] side) were prominent in Stockport in 1500s at [[Underbank Hall]], and Arden Hall (also known as Harden or Hawarden).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Arden Hall Bredbury, Reddish Vale, Stockport {{!}} Artware Fine Art |url=https://www.artwarefineart.com/gallery/arden-hall-bredbury-reddish-vale-stockport |access-date=9 December 2023 |website=artwarefineart.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=ART UK |url=https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/arden-hall-bredbury-cheshire-89738&ved=2ahUKEwiLpcWLxIKDAxW__bsIHZr0ARkQFnoECCQQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2YIlbo0ZqZnukgv5EnjzuQ |access-date=9 December 2023 |website=artuk.org}}</ref>

The castle was probably ruinous by the middle of the 16th century, and in 1642 it was agreed to demolish it. Castle Hill, possibly the motte, was levelled in 1775 to make space for Warren's mill, see below.{{sfnp|Dent|1977|p=2|ps=}}{{sfnp|Pevsner|Hubbard|1971|p=338|ps=}} Nearby walls, once thought to be either part of the castle or of the town walls, are now thought to be revetments to protect the cliff face from erosion.<ref name="Arrowsmith 1996">{{Harvnb|Arrowsmith|1996|p=?}}</ref>

The [[regicide]] [[John Bradshaw (judge)|John Bradshaw]] (1602–1659) was born at Wibersley, in the parish of Stockport, baptised in the parish church and attended [[Stockport College|Stockport Free School]]. A lawyer, he was appointed lord president of the high court of justice for the trial of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649. Although he was dead by the time of the [[Stuart Restoration|Restoration]] in 1660, his body was brought up from [[Westminster Abbey]] and hanged in its coffin at [[Tyburn gallows|Tyburn]].<ref>ODNB entry: [https://archive.today/20120906124211/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3201.

Stockport bridge has been documented as existing since at least 1282. During the [[English Civil War]] the town was supportive of Parliament and was garrisoned by local militias of around 3,000 men commanded by Majors Mainwaring and Duckenfield. [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] advanced on the town on 25 May 1644, with 8–10,000 men and 50 guns, with a brief skirmish at the site of the bridge, in which Colonel Washington's Dragoons led the Royalist attack. Rupert continued his march via Manchester and [[Bolton]] to meet defeat at [[Battle of Marston Moor|Marston Moor]] near York.<ref name="STT"/><ref>The Great Civil War in Lancashire, 1642–1651, Ernest Broxap, Manchester University Press, 1973, Great Britain, p117</ref>

Hatmaking was established in north Cheshire and south-east Lancashire by the 16th century. From the 17th century Stockport became a centre for the hatting industry and later the silk industry. Stockport expanded rapidly during the [[Industrial Revolution]], helped particularly by the growth of the cotton manufacturing industries. However, economic growth took its toll, and 19th century philosopher [[Friedrich Engels]] wrote in 1844 that Stockport was "renowned as one of the duskiest, smokiest holes" in the whole of the industrial area.<ref name="Engels1969">{{citation |last=Engels |first=Frederick |author-link=Frederick Engels |title=The Condition of the Working Class in England |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/ |year=1969 |publisher=Panther |isbn=0-89733-137-0 |quote=Stockport is renowned throughout the entire district as one of the duskiest, smokiest holes, and looks, indeed, especially when viewed from the viaduct, excessively repellent. |orig-year=1845 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421194039/http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/ |archive-date=21 April 2006}}</ref>

Stockport was one of the prototype [[Mill town|textile towns]].<ref name=Rodgers>{{Harvnb|Rodgers|1962|p=13}}</ref> In the early 18th century, England was not capable of producing silk of sufficient quality to be used as the [[Warp and weft|warp]] in woven fabrics. Suitable thread had to be imported from [[Italy]], where it was spun on water-powered machinery. In about 1717 [[John Lombe]] travelled to Italy and copied the design of the machinery. On his return he obtained a patent on the design, and went into production in [[Derby]]. When Lombe tried to renew his patent in 1732, silk spinners from towns including [[Manchester]], [[Macclesfield]], [[Leek, Staffordshire|Leek]], and Stockport successfully petitioned parliament to not renew the patent. Lombe was paid off, and in 1732 Stockport's first silk mill (the first water-powered [[Textile manufacturing|textile mill]] in the north-west of England) was opened on a bend in the Mersey. Further mills were opened on local brooks.

Silk weaving expanded until in 1769 two thousand people were employed in the industry. By 1772 the boom had turned to bust, possibly due to cheaper foreign imports; by the late 1770s trade had recovered.{{sfnp|Arrowsmith|1997|pp=97–101|ps=}} The cycle of boom and bust would continue throughout the textile era.

The combination of a good water power site (described by Rodgers as "by far the finest of any site within the lowland" [of the Manchester region]<ref name=Rodgers/>) and a workforce used to textile factory work meant Stockport was well placed to take advantage of the phenomenal expansion in cotton processing in the late 18th century. Warren's mill in the market place was the first. Power came from an undershot water wheel in a deep pit, fed by a tunnel from the River Goyt. The positioning on high ground, unusual for a water-powered mill, contributed to an early demise, but the concept of moving water around in tunnels proved successful, and several tunnels were driven under the town from the Goyt to power mills.{{sfnp|Dranfield|2006|p=|ps=}} In 1796, James Harrisson drove a wide cut from the Tame which fed several mills in the Park, [[Portwood]].<ref name="Ref_h">{{Harvnb|Arrowsmith|1997|p=130}}; Ashmore (1975).</ref> <!-- apparently it's the Park, not The Park --> Other water-powered mills were built on the Mersey.

The town was connected to the national [[canal]] network by the {{convert|5|mi|km}} of the [[Stockport Branch Canal|Stockport branch]] of the [[Ashton Canal]] opened in 1797 which continued in use until the 1930s. Much of it is now filled in, but there is an active campaign to re-open it for leisure uses.

In the early 19th century, the number of hatters in the area began to increase, and a reputation for high quality work was created. The London firm of Miller Christy bought out a local firm in 1826, a move described by Arrowsmith as a "watershed". By the latter part of the century hatting had changed from a manual to a mechanised process, and was one of Stockport's primary employers; the area, with nearby Denton, was the leading national centre. Support industries, such as blockmaking, trimmings, and leatherware, became established. <!--EXPORTS--> [[Stockport Armoury]] was completed in 1862.<ref name=drill>{{cite web|url=http://www.drillhalls.org/Counties/Cheshire/TownStockport.htm|title=Stockport|publisher=The Drill Halls Project|access-date=13 August 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819060852/http://www.drillhalls.org/Counties/Cheshire/TownStockport.htm|archive-date=19 August 2017}}</ref>

[[World War I]] cut off overseas markets, which established local industries and eroded Stockport's eminence. Even so, in 1932 more than 3,000 people worked in the hatting industry, making it the third biggest employer after textiles and engineering. The depression of the 1930s and changes in fashion greatly reduced the demand for hats, and the demand that existed was met by cheaper wool products made elsewhere, for example the [[Luton]] area.

In 1966, the largest of the region's remaining felt hat manufacturers, Battersby & Co, T & W Lees, J. Moores & Sons, and Joseph Wilson & Sons, merged with Christy & Co to form [[Associated British Hat Manufacturers]], leaving Christy's and Wilson's (at Denton) as the last two factories in production. The Wilson's factory closed in 1980, followed by the Christy's factory in 1997, bringing to an end over 400&nbsp;years of hatting in the area.{{sfnp|McKnight|2000|pp=1–9|ps=}}{{sfnp|Arrowsmith|1997|pp=156–7|ps=}}{{sfnp|Arrowsmith|1997|pp=225–6|ps=}} The industry is commemorated by the UK's only dedicated hatting museum, [[Hat Works]].<ref name="Ref_k">{{citation |title=Hat Works Museum:About us |publisher=Hat Works |url=http://www.hatworks.org.uk/about_us.asp |access-date=2 October 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921212159/http://www.hatworks.org.uk/about_us.asp |archive-date=21 September 2008}}</ref><ref name="Williamson2006">{{citation |last=Williamson |first=Hannah |title=The Character of Hat Works |journal=Manchester Region History Review |volume=17 |year=2006 |pages=111–121 |issue=2}}</ref>

====Recent history====
[[File:Reddish Mill 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Houldsworth Mill, Reddish]]]]
Since the start of the 20th century Stockport has moved away from being a town dependent on cotton and its allied industries to one with a varied base. It makes the most of its varied heritage attractions, including a national museum of hatting, a unique system of [[World War II]] air raid tunnel shelters in the town centre, and a late medieval merchants' house on the 700-year-old Market Place. In 1967, the [[Stockport air disaster]] occurred, when a [[British Midland International|British Midland Airways]] [[Canadair North Star|C-4 Argonaut]] aeroplane crashed in the Hopes Carr area of the town, resulting in 72&nbsp;deaths among the passengers and crew.

[[File:Stockport Town Hall (1).jpg|thumb|right|[[Stockport Town Hall]]]]
There is one main tier of local government covering Stockport, at [[metropolitan borough]] level: [[Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council]], which meets at [[Stockport Town Hall]] on Wellington Road South and has its main offices in the adjoining Stopford House and Fred Perry House. The council is a member of the [[Greater Manchester Combined Authority]], led by the directly elected [[Mayor of Greater Manchester]].

===Administrative history===
Stockport was an [[ancient parish]] in the [[Macclesfield Hundred]] of [[Cheshire]]. The parish was large, being sub-divided into fourteen [[Township (England)|townships]]: [[Bramhall]], [[Bredbury]], [[Brinnington]], [[Disley]], [[Dukinfield]], [[Hyde, Greater Manchester|Hyde]], [[Marple, Greater Manchester|Marple]], [[Norbury, Greater Manchester|Norbury]], [[Offerton, Greater Manchester|Offerton]], [[Romiley]], [[Stockport Etchells]], [[Torkington]], [[Compstall|Werneth]], and a Stockport township covering the central part of the parish including the town itself. The townships were all made separate [[civil parish]]es in 1866.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stockport Ancient Parish / Civil Parish |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10157791 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=3 June 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Youngs |first1=Frederic |title=Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England: Volume 2 |date=1991 |publisher=Royal Historical Society |location=London |isbn=0861931270 |page=35}}</ref>

The Stockport township was an [[ancient borough]], having been made a borough during the reign of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (reigned 1216–1272).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=S. |title=A Topographical Dictionary of England |date=1848 |pages=209–215 |url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/topographical-dict/england/pp209-215 |access-date=3 June 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Parliamentary Papers |date=1838 |page=127 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TgZEAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA2-PA127 |access-date=3 June 2024}}</ref> A [[Stockport (UK Parliament constituency)|Stockport parliamentary borough]] (constituency) was created in 1832, covering the old borough of Stockport, part of the township of Brinnington, the hamlets of Brinksway and [[Edgeley]] from the parish of [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]], and part of the township of [[Heaton Norris]], the latter being on the north side of the [[River Mersey]] and forming part of the [[Manchester (ancient parish)|ancient parish of Manchester]] in [[Lancashire]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Parliamentary Boundaries Act |date=1832 |page=335 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uq0uAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA335 |access-date=3 June 2024}}</ref>

Stockport was reformed to become a [[municipal borough]] in 1836 under the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country. As part of that reform, the borough boundaries were enlarged to match the recently created constituency. The borough of Stockport therefore straddled Cheshire and Lancashire from 1836 onwards.<ref>{{cite book |title=Municipal Corporations Act |date=1835 |page=458 |url=https://archive.org/details/statutesunitedk35britgoog/page/458/mode/2up?q=Stockport |access-date=3 June 2024}}</ref>

Under the terms of the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]], Stockport [[Poor law union|Poor Law Union]] was established on 3 February 1837 and was responsible for an area covering 16 parishes or townships (mostly from the old parish of Stockport) with a total population of 68,906. Stockport Union built a [[workhouse]] at Shaw Heath in 1841.<ref name=Workhouses>{{citation |title=Stockport |url=http://www.workhouses.org.uk/Stockport/ |publisher=workhouses.org.uk |access-date=16 August 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117070803/http://www.workhouses.org.uk/Stockport |archive-date=17 November 2010}}</ref>

When elected county councils were established in 1889, Stockport was considered large enough to provide its own county-level services, and so it was made a [[county borough]], independent from both [[Cheshire County Council]] and [[Lancashire County Council]]. The borough boundaries were enlarged several times, notably absorbing the [[Urban district (England and Wales)|urban districts]] of [[Reddish]] in 1901 and Heaton Norris in 1913.<ref>{{cite web |title=Reddish Township / Civil Parish |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10376981#tab02 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=3 June 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Heaton Norris Urban District |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10109498#tab02 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=3 June 2024}}</ref> It continued to straddle the [[Ceremonial counties of England#Geographical counties 1889–1974|geographical counties]] of Cheshire and Lancashire until 1974, although it was placed entirely in Lancashire for judicial purposes in 1956.<ref>{{cite book |title=Criminal Justice Administration Act 1956 |date=30 October 2023 |page=168 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o9guAAAAIAAJ |access-date=22 October 2023}}</ref>

In 1974, under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the old [[County Borough of Stockport]] was amalgamated with neighbouring districts to form the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport in the [[metropolitan county]] of Greater Manchester. In 1986, [[Greater Manchester County Council]] was abolished and [[Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council]] assumed its functions, with some services being provided by joint committees.

In 2011, Stockport bid for city status as part of the 2012 Queen's [[Diamond jubilee|Diamond Jubilee]] celebrations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stockport.gov.uk/doitonline/multimedia/citybid2012video|title=Stockport Council - Stockport City Bid for 2012 Video|date=18 July 2012|access-date=2 May 2018|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718211009/http://www.stockport.gov.uk/doitonline/multimedia/citybid2012video|archive-date=18 July 2012}}</ref> but was unsuccessful.

===Parliamentary representation===
There are four parliamentary constituencies in the Stockport Metropolitan Borough: [[Stockport (UK Parliament constituency)|Stockport]], [[Reddish and denton]], [[Cheadle (UK Parliament constituency)|Cheadle]] and [[Hazel Grove (UK Parliament constituency)|Hazel Grove]]. Stockport has been represented by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Navendu Mishra]] since [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019]]. [[Tom Morrison (British politician)|Tom Morrison]] has been the Liberal Democrat MP for [[Cheadle (UK Parliament constituency)|Cheadle]] since 2024 and [[Lisa Smart (British politician)|Lisa Smart]] has been the Lib Dem MP for Hazel Grove since [[2024 United Kingdom general election|2024]].

Although suburbs such as [[Woodford, Greater Manchester|Woodford]], [[Bramhall]] and [[Cheadle Hulme]] are relatively wealthy and 45% of the borough is green space, districts such as [[Edgeley]], [[Adswood]], [[Shaw Heath]] and [[Brinnington]] are among the poorer areas.

Beside the M60 motorway is the [[Stockport Pyramid]], a distinctive structure designed by Christopher Denny from Michael Hyde and Associates. It has a steel frame covered with mostly blue glass and clear glass paneling at the apex and was intended to be the signature building for a much larger development planned in 1987. Construction began in the early 1990s and it was completed in 1992 but an economic downturn caused the project to be abandoned as the developers went into administration. The building lay empty until 1995 when [[The Co-operative Bank]] repossessed it and opened it as a [[call centre]].

Vernon Park, to the east towards [[Bredbury]], was opened on 20 September 1858 on the anniversary of the [[Battle of the Alma]] in the [[Crimean War]]. It was named after [[George Venables-Vernon, 5th Baron Vernon|Lord Vernon]] who presented the land to the town.

[[St Elisabeth's Church, Reddish]], and the [[model village]] are parts of a mill community designed in the main by [[Alfred Waterhouse]] for workers of [[Houldsworth Mill, Reddish|Houldsworth Mill]].
