In June 2019, its population was 979,768, with a population density of 3,605 people per km<sup>2</sup>. The city has an area of {{convert|271.77|sqkm|sqmi}}.

Chiba City is one of the [[Kantō region]]'s primary seaports, and is home to [[Port of Chiba|Chiba Port]], which handles one of the highest volumes of cargo in Japan. Much of the city is residential, although there are many factories and warehouses along the coast. There are several major urban centres in the city, including [[Makuhari]], a prime waterfront business district in which [[Makuhari Messe]] is located, and Central Chiba, in which the prefectural government office and the city hall are located.

Chiba is famous for the [[Chiba Urban Monorail]], the longest suspended [[monorail]] in the world. Some popular destinations in the city include: Kasori Shell Midden, the largest [[shellmound|shell mound]] in the world at {{convert|134000|m2|sqyd|abbr=on}}, Inage Beach, the first artificial beach in Japan which forms part of the longest artificial beach in Japan, and the [[Chiba Zoological Park]], popular on account of the standing [[red panda]] [[Futa (red panda)|Futa]].

==Etymology==
The name of Chiba in the [[Japanese language]] is formed from two ''[[kanji]]'' characters. The first, {{lang|ja|{{linktext|千}}}}, means "[[thousand]]" and the second, {{lang|ja|{{linktext|葉}}}} means "leaves". The name first appears as an ancient ''[[kuni no miyatsuko]]'', or regional command office, as {{Nihongo|Chiha no Kuni no Miyatsuko|千葉国造}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nihonjiten.com/data/263228.html |script-title=ja:千葉国造（下総） |website=nihonjiten.com |language=ja}}</ref> The name was adopted by a branch of the [[Taira clan]], which moved to the area in present-day Chiba City in the late [[Heian period]]. The branch of the Taira adopted the name and became the [[Chiba clan]], which held strong influence over the area of the prefecture until the [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]]. The name "Chiba" was chosen for Chiba Prefecture at the time of its creation in 1873 by the {{nihongo|[[Assembly of Prefectural Governors]]|地方官会議|Chihō Kankai Kaigi}}, an early [[Meiji period|Meiji-period]] body of prefectural governors that met to decide the structure of local and regional administration in Japan.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Nihon Rekishi Chimei Taikei (日本歴史地名大系) |script-title=ja:千葉県の成立と行政的変遷 |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |access-date=2012-04-01 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |language=ja |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archive-date=2007-08-25 }}</ref>

==History==

===Early history===
The first records related to the city of Chiba record the emigration of [[Taira Tsuneshige]] (1083?&ndash;1088), a powerful ''[[Samurai|bushi]]'' warlord of the late Heian period, to [[Shimōsa Province]], which historically occupied the north of Chiba Prefecture. Tsuneshige was appointed as ''gunji'' administrator of [[Sōma District, Chiba|Sōma District]], but was transferred to the same position in [[Chiba District, Chiba|Chiba District]] two years later. Here he proclaimed himself {{Nihongo|[[Chiba Tsuneshige]]|千葉常重}}, became a ''[[Kokushi (official)|kokushi]]'' governor of the province, and used the area around present-day Chiba City as a power base to rule over Shimōsa Province, [[Kazusa Province]], as well as establish himself as a military force in the [[Kantō region]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Nihon Jinmei Daijiten (日本人名大辞典) |trans-title=Chiba Tsuneshige |script-title=ja:千葉常重 |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |access-date=2012-04-10 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |language=ja |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archive-date=2007-08-25 }}</ref> Tsuneshige's son, {{Nihongo|[[Chiba Tsunetane]]|千葉常胤}} (1118–1201) was instrumental in aiding [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] (1147–1199) with the establishment of the [[Kamakura shogunate]]. Tsuneshige built a spacious residence and numerous temples in present-day Chiba City, and in the same period he transferred his power base from [[Ōji Castle]] to a mansion in present-day Chiba City.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=千葉市 |title=猪鼻城跡 Site of Inohana Castle |url=https://www.city.chiba.jp/kyoiku/shogaigakushu/bunkazai/tagengo_inohanajo.html |access-date=2024-06-16 |website=千葉市 |language=ja}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Nihon Jinmei Daijiten (日本人名大辞典) |trans-title=Chiba Tsunetane |script-title=ja:千葉常胤 |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |access-date=2012-04-10 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |language=ja |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archive-date=2007-08-25 }}</ref> The area of present-day Chiba City became ''[[jōkamachi]]'' {{Nihongo||城下町|}}, or [[castle town]], and prospered under the Chiba clan.<ref name="encyclopedia-chiba">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Japan |title=Chiba |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |access-date=2012-04-10 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archive-date=2007-08-25 }}</ref> The clan's power extended in the region until the [[Muromachi period]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Japan |title=Chiba |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |access-date=2012-02-27 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archive-date=2007-08-25 }}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Kokushi Daijiten (国史大辞典) |trans-title=Chiba-shi |script-title=ja:千葉氏 |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |access-date=2012-04-10 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |language=ja |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archive-date=2007-08-25 }}</ref>

===Medieval period===
The Chiba clan's power and influence declined because of wars around the [[Kantō region]] during the [[Nanboku-chō period|Nanboku-chō]] and [[Muromachi period]]s. In the 16th century, the [[Hara clan]], which were vassals of Chiba clan, took control of the region from the Chiba clan and built [[Inohana Castle]].<ref name=":0" /> In the [[Sengoku period]], the Hara clan was forcibly removed by Ashikaga Yoshiaki (足利義明, not to be confused with [[Ashikaga Yoshiaki|足利義昭]]). Then, Ashikaga Yoshiaki was also removed by the Sakai (酒井 not to be confused with the [[Sakai clan]] in [[Mikawa Province|Mikawa]]) clan, which was one of the servants of the [[Satomi clan|Satomi]] (里見) clan. Finally both the [[Chiba clan|Chiba]] and Sakai clans were annihilated by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]].

===Later history===
In the [[Edo period]], the {{Nihongo|[[Oyumi clan|Oyumi]]|生実氏}}, {{Nihongo|[[Morikawa clan|Morikawa]]|森川氏}} clan, and the {{Nihongo|[[Sakura clan|Sakura]]|佐倉氏}} clans governed the area now occupied by the city. A part of the area was also governed directly by the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa Bakufu]]. The Oyumi clan governed their territory stably. On the other hand, according to the Sakura clan, from the beginning of the [[Edo period]], changed governors frequently, including [[Takeda Nobuyoshi]], [[Matsudaira Tadateru]], {{Nihongo|[[Ogasawara Yoshitsugu]]|小笠原吉次}}, and [[Doi Toshikatsu]]. Finally the [[Hotta clan]] stabilized the governance of their territory. Chiba prospered in this period as a {{nihongo|''shukuba''|宿場}} post-town of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].<ref name="encyclopedia-chiba"/>

===Modern history===
After the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, Chiba Prefecture was established in 1873 with the merger of Kisarazu Prefecture and Inba Prefecture. The border between Kisarazu and Inba was the location of Chiba Town and was thus chosen as the location of the prefectural government. With the opening of the [[Sobu Main Line]], Chiba developed rapidly, becoming the political, economic, and cultural capital of Chiba Prefecture. The town of Chiba was established within Chiba District with the creation of the municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Chiba City formed on January 1, 1921.<ref name="encyclopedia-chiba"/> Numerous small villages and towns were merged into the previous {{nihongo|town of Chiba|千葉町}}, a process that continued until 1944. Large-scale [[land reclamation]] added to the area of the city throughout the 20th century. The city was a major center of military production leading up to the Pacific War, and the aerial [[bombing of Chiba]] in 1945. The city was almost completely destroyed by the end of the war. Post-war industrialization led to the city becoming a major part of the [[Keiyō Industrial Zone]].<ref name="encyclopedia-chiba"/> Chiba became a [[Cities designated by government ordinance of Japan|Designated City of Japan]] on April 1, 1992.<ref name="chimei-chiba"/>
