It is part of the [[Costa del Sol]] and is the headquarters of the Association of Municipalities of the region; it is also the head of the judicial district that bears its name.

Marbella is situated on the [[Mediterranean Sea]], between [[Málaga]] and the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], in the foothills of the [[Sierra Blanca (Andalusia)|Sierra Blanca]]. The municipality covers an area of {{convert|117|km2|0|abbr=out}} crossed by highways on the coast, which are its main entrances.

In 2023, the population of the city was 156,295 inhabitants,<ref name="http://www.ine.es/en/wel/faq_en.htm#3">{{cite book|title=La población andaluza|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=muCvMwEACAAJ|access-date=28 January 2013|year=2011|publisher=[[Instituto de Estadística y Cartografía de Andalucía]]}}</ref> making it the second most populous municipality in the [[province of Málaga]] and the seventh in Andalusia. It is one of the most important tourist cities of the Costa del Sol and throughout most of the year is an international tourist attraction, due mainly to its climate and tourist infrastructure.

==Geography==
The Marbella municipality occupies a strip of land that extends along {{convert|44|km|mi|abbr=off|spell=in}} of coastline of the [[Penibaetic System|Penibético]] region, sheltered by the slopes of the coastal mountain range, which includes  the Bermeja, Palmitera, Royal, White and Alpujata sub-ranges. Due to the proximity of the mountains to the coast, the city has a large gap between its north and south sides, thus providing views of the sea and mountain vistas from almost every part of the city. The coastline is heavily urbanised; most of the land not built up with golf courses has been developed with small residential areas. Marbella is bordered on the north by the municipalities of [[Istán]] and [[Ojén]], on the northwest by [[Benahavís]], on the west by [[Estepona]] and on the northeast by [[Mijas]]. The Mediterranean Sea lies to the south.

===Topography===
[[File:Cabopino beach, Costa del Sol, Spain 2005.jpg|thumb|Dunes of Artola, the Sierra Blanca in the background]]
There are five [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] areas in Marbella—the [[Sierra Blanca (Andalusia)|Sierra Blanca]], the Sierra Blanca piedmont (foothills), the lower hill country, the plains and the coastal dunes.<ref name="Marbella: mapa geológico de España">{{cite book|title=Marbella: mapa geológico de España|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ISdbxhaXbukC|access-date=28 January 2013|year=1978|publisher=Ministerio de Industria y Energía}}</ref> The Sierra Blanca is the most centrally-located in the province, peaking behind the old village. The mountain range has three notable peaks—La Concha, located further west at {{convert|1215|m|ft|abbr=in}} above sea level, Juanar Cross, located eastward (within the municipality of [[Ojen]]) at {{convert|1178|m|ft|abbr=in}} above sea level, and the highest, Mount Lastonar, located between the two at {{convert|1270|m|ft|abbr=in}}. Marbella's topography is characterised by extensive coastal plains formed from eroded mountains.<ref name="D.)2002">{{cite book|author=Teresa Moreno (Ph. D.)|title=The Geology of Spain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=boiQ_0ki6fwC|access-date=28 January 2013|year=2002|publisher=Geological Society|isbn=978-1-86239-127-7|page=85}}</ref> North of the plain is an area of around {{convert|100|and|400|m|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=in}} above sea level, encompassing low, rolling hills, with higher foothills and steeper slopes approaching the mountains behind. The coast is generally low-lying, with sandy beaches that are more extensive further east, between the fishing port and {{ill|lt=Cabopino|Puerto de Cabopino|es|vertical-align=sup}}. Despite the intense urbanisation of the coast, it still retains a natural area of dunes, the Artola Dunes (''Dunas de Artola''), at the eastern end of town.

===Hydrography===
[[File:Pantano de Río Verde.jpg|thumb|The La Concepción reservoir]]
The entire region lies within the Andalusian Mediterranean Basin. The rivers are short and have very steep banks, so that flash floods are common.<ref name="HerreroHuerta2009">{{cite book|author1=Andrés Díez Herrero|author2=Luis Laín Huerta|author3=Miguel Llorente Isidro|title=A handbook on flood hazard mapping methodologies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4nXerdbeEogC|access-date=12 April 2013|year=2009|publisher=IGME|isbn=978-84-7840-813-9|page=23}}</ref> These include the [[Guadalmina River|Guadalmina]], the [[Guadaiza]], the Verde and the Rio Real, which provide most of the water supply. The irregularity of rainfall has resulted in intermittent rivers that often run dry in summer; most of the many streams that cross the city have been bridged. The [https://www.visitcostadelsol.com/things-to-do/la-concepcion-reservoir-p29411 La Concepción reservoir] supplies the population with drinking water—apart from this water feature, there are other reservoirs, like El Viejo and El Nuevo (the 'Old' and the 'New'), that irrigated the old agricultural colony of El Ángel. Additionally, [https://www.andalucia.com/marbella/parks/las-medranas.htm Las Medranas] and [[Llano de la Leche]] irrigated the plantations of the colony of [[San Pedro de Alcántara]].

===Climate===
Marbella has a [[subtropical]] [[Hot-summer Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean climate]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.juntadeandalucia.es/medioambiente/servtc5/WebClima/descripcion_clima_med_subtropical.jsp|title=Clima mediterráneo subtropical|work=[[Junta de Andalucía]]|language=es|access-date=7 December 2021|archive-url=https://archive.today/20211207034309/https://www.juntadeandalucia.es/medioambiente/servtc5/WebClima/descripcion_clima_med_subtropical.jsp |archive-date=7 December 2021 |date=2021}}</ref> ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa'') with humid, very mild winters (for European standards) and warm to hot, dry summers. Marbella is protected on its northern side by the coastal mountains of the Cordillera Penibética and so enjoys a climate with an average annual temperature between {{convert|18|and|19|°C|0|abbr=on}}. During winters, the highest peaks of the nearby mountain range are occasionally covered with snow, which can be seen from the coastline of Marbella when it snows on the [[Sierra Blanca (Andalusia)|Sierra Blanca]] mountain peak at {{convert|1,275|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Filomena se despide de Marbella con nieve en Sierra Blanca|url=http://www.marbelladirecto.com/noticia/filomena-se-despide-de-marbella-con-nieve-en-sierra-blanca/15746|publisher=Marbella Directo|language=Spanish|access-date=18 September 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=El último coletazo de Filomena hace que la nieve se asome a Marbella|url=https://www.marbella24horas.es/local/el-ultimo-coletazo-de-filomena-hace-que-la-nieve-se-asome-a-marbella-29418|publisher=Marbella 24 horas|language=Spanish|access-date=18 September 2021}}</ref> Average rainfall is {{convert|645.8|mm|in|abbr=on}}, while hours of sunshine average above 2,900 annually.<ref>{{cite web|title=Valores climatológicos normales|url=http://www.aemet.es/es/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos|publisher=[[AEMET]]|language=Spanish|access-date=18 September 2021}}</ref>

===Flora and fauna===
[[File:Artola-Cabopino 03.jpg|thumb|Playa de Cabopino (Cabopino beach) of the Dunas de Artola]]
As most of the montane and wilderness areas around Marbella are under the management and protection of the central government, a great biodiversity is still thriving, with numerous [[Endemism|endemic]] trees and plants, including [[chestnut]] and [[Cherry|cherry trees]], [[fir]] trees, [[Aleppo pine|Aleppo]], [[Monterrey pine|Monterrey]] and [[Pinus pinaster|maritime pines]], [[pinyon pine|pinyons]], and [[fern]]s.

The census counted about 10,000 people in 1950; population growth since has been as great as that of neighboring towns. Between 1950 and 2001 the population grew by 897%, with the decade of the 1960s having the highest relative increase, at 141%. In 2001, only 26.2% of Marbella's population had been born there, 15.9% were foreign-born, and those born in other towns in Spain made up the difference. During the summer months the population of Marbella  increases by 30% with the arrival of tourists and foreigners who have their second homes in the area.<ref>{{cite web|title=Federación de Asociaciones de Vecinos de Marbella|url=http://www.vecinosdemarbella.com/federacion/2008/09/29/marbella-concentra-el-83-por-ciento-de-la-poblacion-de-la-provincia-de-malaga/|publisher=Federación de Asociaciones de Vecinos de Marbella|access-date=12 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122095924/http://www.vecinosdemarbella.com/federacion/2008/09/29/marbella-concentra-el-83-por-ciento-de-la-poblacion-de-la-provincia-de-malaga/|archive-date=22 November 2011|language=es|date=29 September 2008}}</ref>

The population is concentrated in two main centres: Marbella and San Pedro Alcántara; the rest is scattered in many developments in the districts of Nueva Andalucia and Las Chapas, located along the coast and on the mountain slopes. According to a study by the Association of Municipalities of the Costa del Sol, based on the production of solid waste in 2003, Marbella had a population of about 246,000 inhabitants, almost twice that of the population census of 2008. From the estimated volume of municipal waste in 2010, the City calculates the population during the summer months at around 400,000 people, while official police sources estimated it at about 500,000, with a peak of up to 700,000 people. {{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The use of "marbellí" as a gentilic was popularised by the writer and journalist Víctor de la Serna (1896–1958), who wrote a series of documentary articles on "The Navy of Andalucía"; in his research he had come upon the ''Historia de Málaga y Su Provincia'' (History of Málaga and the Province) by Francisco Guillén Robles, who used the plural word "marbellíes" to designate the Muslim inhabitants of Marbella.<ref name="Robles1874">{{cite book|author=Francisco Guillén Robles|title=Historia de Málaga y su provincia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X0IOAAAAQAAJ|access-date=28 January 2013|year=1874|publisher=Rubio y Cano|page=216}}</ref>

==History==

===Prehistory and antiquity===
[[File:Puente romano- Marbella.jpg|upright|thumb|Remains of the [[Roman bridge]] of Marbella]]

Archaeological excavations have been made in the mountains around Marbella which point to human habitation in Paleolithic and Neolithic times. Some historians believe that the first settlement on the present site of Marbella was founded by the Phoenicians in the 7th century BC, as they are known to have established several colonies on the coast of Málaga province. However, no remains have been found of any significant settlement, although some artefacts of [[Phoenicia]]n and later [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] settlements have been unearthed in different parts of the municipality, as in the fields of Rio Real and Cerro Torrón.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Castro|first=J.

The existence of a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] population centre in what is now the ''El Casco Antiguo'' (Old Town) is suggested by three [[Ionic capital]]s embedded in one section of the ''Murallas del Castillo'' (Moorish castle walls), that reused materials of a building from earlier times. Recent discoveries in ''La Calle Escuelas'' (School Street) and other remains scattered throughout the old town testify to a Roman occupation as well.

All of these further demonstrate a continued human presence in the area.

In 1283 the  Marinid sultan [[Abu Yusuf Yaqub ibn Abd Al-Haqq]] launched a campaign against the [[Kingdom of Granada]].

On 11 June 1485, the town passed into the hands of the [[Crown of Castile]] without bloodshed. The [[Catholic Monarchs]] gave Marbella the title of city and capital of the region and made it a ''realengo'' (royal protectorate). The ''[[Plaza de los Naranjos]]'' was built along the lines of Castilian urban design about this time, as well as some of the historical buildings that surround it. The ''Fuerte de San Luis de Marbella'' (Fort of San Luis) was built in 1554 by Charles V. The main door faced north and was protected by a moat with a drawbridge. Today, the ruins of the fort house a museum, and on the grounds are the ''Iglesia del Santo Cristo de la Vera Cruz'' (Church of the Holy Christ of the True Cross) and ''Ermita del Calvario'' (Calvary Chapel). Sugar cane was introduced to Marbella in 1644, the cultivation of which spread on the Málaga province coast,<ref name="House1879">{{cite book|author=United States. Congress.

The simultaneous dismantling of the iron industry, based in the forges of ''El  Angel'' and ''La Concepción'', disrupted the local economy.  Much of the population had to return to farming or fishing for a livelihood.

In the late 19th century, Marbella was a village composed of three parts: the main districts, the Barrio Alto or San Francisco, and the Barrio Nuevo. There were three smaller nuclei arranged around the old ironworks and the farm-model of the colony of San Pedro Alcántara, as well as isolated dwellings in orchards and farms. The general population was divided between a small group of oligarchs and the working people, the middle class being practically non-existent.

===20th century===
In the early decades of the century the first hotels were built: El Comercial, which opened in 1918, and the Miramar, in 1926.<ref name="Jurado2003">{{cite book|author=Enrique Navarro Jurado|title=Puede seguir creciendo la Costa del Sol?: indicadores de saturación de un destino turístico|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ffURAQAAIAAJ|access-date=13 April 2013|year=2003|publisher=Servicio de Publicaciones, Diputación Provincial de Málaga|isbn=978-84-7785-585-9|page=29}}</ref> During the Second Republic, Marbella experienced major social changes and contentious political parties mobilized.

As the [[Spanish Civil War]] began in the late 1930s, Marbella and [[Casares, Málaga|Casare]] suffered more anticlerical violence than the rest of western Málaga province.  The day after the failed uprising which led to the civil war, several religious buildings in Marbella were set on fire.

Soriano's nephew, [[Prince Alfonso of Hohenlohe-Langenburg]], descendant of a high-ranking aristocratic family (his mother, María de la Piedad de Yturbe y Scholtz-Hersmendorff, was the Marquesa de Belvís de las Navas) acquired another estate, ''Finca Santa Margarita''.  In 1954, he opened the [[Marbella Club Hotel|Marbella Club]], an international resort aimed at movie stars, business executives and the nobility.

Both resorts came to be frequented by members of European aristocratic families with famous names: Bismarck, Rothschild, Thurn und Taxis, Metternich, de Mora y Aragon, de Salamanca or Thyssen-Bornemisza.  This transformed Marbella into a destination for the international [[jet set]].<ref name="webdelayuntamiento"/>  Trading on Prince Alfonso's kinship to the [[court (royal)|royal courts]] of Europe, his hotel quickly proved popular with vacationing members of Europe's social elites for its casual but discreet luxury.

From the first democratic elections after the adoption of the 1978 Spanish Constitution, until 1991, all the mayors of Marbella were members of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers Party]] ('El Partido Socialista Obrero Español' or PSOE in Spanish).<ref>{{cite web|title=Ayuntamientos |url=http://www.webmalaga.com/organismos/ayuntamientos/ficha.asp?cod=100&mun=29069 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724115521/http://www.webmalaga.com/organismos/ayuntamientos/ficha.asp?cod=100&mun=29069  |archive-date=24 July 2009 |publisher=Ayuntamiento de Marbella |access-date=15 April 2013 }}</ref>

In 1991, the builder and president of [[Atlético Madrid]], [[Jesús Gil]] was elected mayor of Marbella by a wide majority. He and his party, the right-wing populist [[Independent Liberal Group]] ('Grupo Independiente Liberal' or GIL in Spanish), promised to fight petty crime as well as the region's declining prestige. Actor [[Sean Connery]] became Marbella's international spokesman, although Connery later ended this business relationship after Gil used his image in an election campaign. Gil's administration facilitated a building boom. However, critics complained about disregard for the existing urban plan, market speculation and environmental predation by developers; the regional Andalusian government suspended some development. Gil despised town-hall formalities, instead ruling from his office at the Club Financiero, and cultivated a maverick image. The PSOE and the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] criticized Gil even at the national level, but voters re-elected him and some Spanish celebrities continued to spend summers there. Gil's political party, GIL, also proved popular in other tourist-dependent [[Costa del Sol]] towns like [[Estepona]], and even across the Strait of Gibraltar to the Spanish North African cities of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]].

In 1999, Gil was convicted of embezzling public funds and falsifying public documents.<ref>{{cite news|title=Causas contra Gil y sus encarcelamientos|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2004/05/14/espana/1084559880.html|access-date=15 April 2013|newspaper=El Mundo|date=14 May 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120151249/http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2004/05/14/espana/1084559880.html|archive-date=20 November 2012}}</ref> Gil died in 2004, and his party remained in power until 2006, but related scandals continue to this day, as discussed below.

==Landmarks and places of interest==
[[File:Plano Casco Antiguo-Marbella.jpg|thumb|Map of the old town with its main buildings]]

===Old Town (Casco Antiguo)===
The old town of Marbella includes the ancient city walls and the two historical suburbs of the city, the ''Barrio Alto'', which extends north, and the ''Barrio Nuevo'', located to the east. The ancient walled city retains nearly the same layout as in the 16th century. Here is the ''Plaza de los Naranjos'', an example of Castilian Renaissance design, its plan laid out in the heart of Old Town after the Christian reconquest.<ref name="HazelParry2004">{{cite book|author1=George Hazel|author2=Roger Parry|title=Making cities work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ToxPAAAAMAAJ|access-date=14 April 2013|year=2004|publisher=Wiley-Academy|pages=75–77|isbn=978-0-470-84681-0}}</ref> Around the square are arranged three remarkable buildings: the town hall, built in 1568 by the Catholic Monarchs in Renaissance style, the Mayor's house, which combines Gothic and Renaissance elements in its façade, with a roof of [[Mudéjar#Mudéjar style|Mudejar style]] and fresco murals inside, and the Chapel of Santiago, the oldest religious building in the city, built earlier than the square and not aligned with it, believed to date from the 15th century. Other buildings of interest in the centre are the Church of Santa María de la Encarnación, built in the Baroque style starting in 1618, the ''Casa del Roque'', and the remains of the Arabic castle and defensive walls; also in the  Renaissance style are the [[San Juan de Dios, Marbella|''Capilla de San Juan de Dios'']] (Chapel of St. John of God), the ''Hospital Real de la Misericordia'' (Royal Hospital of Mercy) and the ''[[Hospital Bazán]]'' which now houses the Museum of Contemporary Spanish Engravings.
[[File:Ermita del Santo Cristo Marbella.JPG|left|thumb|upright|[[Ermita del Santo Cristo de la Vera Cruz (Marbella)|Ermita del Santo Cristo]]]]

One of the highlights of the Barrio Alto is the [[Ermita del Santo Cristo de la Vera Cruz (Marbella)|''Ermita del Santo Cristo de la Vera Cruz'']] (Hermitage of the Holy Christ of the True Cross), built in the 15th century and enlarged in the 18th century, which consists of a square tower with a roof covered by glazed ceramic tiles. The ''Barrio Alto'' is also known as the San Francisco neighborhood, after a Franciscan convent formerly located there. The so-called ''Nuevo Barrio'' (New Town), separated from the walled city by the ''Arroyo de la Represa'', has no monumental buildings but retains its original layout and much of its character in the simple whitewashed houses with their tiled roofs and exposed wooden beams, orchards and small corrals.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trazado cartesiano de sus antiguas calles|url=http://www.minube.com/rincon/barrio-nuevo-a509901|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901014751/http://www.minube.com/rincon/barrio-nuevo-a509901|archive-date=1 September 2011|language=es|date=14 June 2011}}</ref>

===Historic extension (Ensanche histórico)===
[[File:Parque de la Constitución.jpg|thumb|upright|Constitution Park]]
Between the old town and the sea in the area known as the "historic extension" (''ensanche histórico''), there is a small botanical garden on Paseo de la Alameda, and a garden with fountains and a collection of ten sculptures by [[Salvador Dalí]] on the Avenida del Mar, which connects the old town with the beach. To the west of this road, passing the Faro de Marbella, is Constitution Park (''Parque de la Constitución''), which houses the auditorium of the same name and the Skol Apartments, designed in the [[Modern architecture|Modernist]] style by the Spanish architect Manuel Jaén Albaitero.

===Marbella's Golden Mile===
What is known as Marbella's Golden Mile is actually a stretch of {{convert|4|mi|abbr=out|spell=in|disp=or}} which begins at the western edge of Marbella city and stretches to Puerto Banús. The area is home to some of Marbella's most luxurious villas and estates with views of mountain and sea, such as the Palace of [[King Fahd]], as well as some landmark hotels,<ref name="King2000">{{cite book|author=Mona King|title=Essential Costa del Sol|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xEy9I0A6UWkC|access-date=16 April 2013|year=2000|publisher=AA Publishing|isbn=978-0-7495-2371-8|page=68}}</ref> among them the Melia Don Pepe, the Hotel Marbella Club and the [[Hotel Puente Romano]].

The Golden Mile is divided into two parts by a motorway that runs through it. Along the motorway are strings of business centres, five-star hotels, golf course and other services. The beachside of the motorway is fully developed, while the mountain side is still undergoing development. Urbanisations in the area's sea side are Alhambra del Mar, La Alcazaba, Las Torres, Los Verdiales, Marbellamar, Marina Marbella, Oasis, Rio Verde and Santa Margarita. On the mountainside of the motorway, the following residential areas are currently being developed: Sierra Blanca, Nagüeles, Cascada de Camoján, Jardines Colgantes, Marbella Hill Club, El Venero, El Batatal, La Capellania, La Virginia, Carolina, El Vicario, Altos de Salamanca, Casas del Señorio de Marbella, Coto Real, and Ancon Sierra.<ref name="GM">[http://www.andalucia.com/marbella/goldenmile.htm Marbella's Golden Mile], andalucia.com</ref>

The Golden Mile should not be confused with the New Golden Mile which is a marketing name given to the area between San Pedro de Alcantara and Estepona.<ref name="NGM">[http://blog.casauna.com/7/the-new-golden-mile-on-costa-del-sol  New Golden Mile].</ref>

===Nueva Andalucía===
Nueva Andalucía is an area just west of Marbella and inland from the marina of Puerto Banús. Home to many golf courses, it is also known as Golf Valley. The bullring by Centro Plaza marks the entrance to Nueva Andalucia where the villas and apartments are based on traditional Andalusian architecture and design. Nueva Andalucia is a very popular residential area both due to its three golf courses, but also due to an increasing number of restaurants and entertainment venues. The three golf courses in Nueva Andalucia are [https://www.losnaranjos.com/ Los Naranjos Golf Club], [http://www.realclubdegolflasbrisas.com/es/ Las Brisas Golf Club] and [http://www.clubdegolfaloha.com/general/ Aloha Golf].<ref name="Nueva Andalucia">{{Cite web |url=https://optimusmarbella.com/nueva-andalucia-guide/ |title=Nueva-andalucia-guide - Avante Real Estate & Investment |access-date=2019-04-15 |archive-date=2019-04-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190415192258/https://optimusmarbella.com/nueva-andalucia-guide/  }}</ref><ref name="NA">[http://www.andalucia.com/marbella/nueva_andalucia.htm Nueva Andalucía], andalucia.com</ref>

===San Pedro Alcántara===
At the heart of San Pedro Alcántara are two industrial buildings of the 19th century: the ''Trapiche de Guadaiza'' and the sugar mill, which now houses the Ingenio Cultural Centre. The 19th century heritage of San Pedro is also represented by two buildings of colonial style, the parish Church and the Villa of San Luis, residence of the Marqués del Duero. Next to San Pedro, near the mouth of the river Guadalmina, are some of the most important archaeological sites in Marbella: the early Christian ''[[Basílica de Vega del Mar]]'', the vaulted Roman baths of Las Bóvedas (the Domes) and the eponymous watch tower of ''Torre de Las Bóvedas''.<ref name="Office1916">{{cite book|author=United States.

===District of Las Chapas===
In the eastern part of the municipality in the district of Las Chapas is the site of ''Rio Real'', situated on a promontory near the mouth of the river of the same name. Here traces of Phoenician habitation dating to the early 7th century BC were discovered in excavations made during an archaeological expedition led by Pedro Sánchez in 1998.<ref name="WawnWood2000_p221">{{cite book|author1=Christopher Wawn|author2=David Wood|title=In search of Andalucia: a historical geographical observation of the Málaga sea board|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8hJpAAAAMAAJ|access-date=14 April 2013|year=2000|publisher=Pentland|isbn=978-1-85821-690-4|page=221}}</ref><ref name="DommelenBellard2008">{{cite book|author1=Peter Alexander René van Dommelen|author2=Carlos Gómez Bellard|author3=Roald F.

===Beaches===
[[File:Marbella Beach, Costa Del Sol, Spain - Sept 2008.jpg|thumb|The beach-front in Marbella]]
The {{convert|27|km|0|abbr=off}} of coastline within the limits of Marbella is divided into twenty-four beaches with different features; however, due to expansion of the municipality, they are all now semi-urban. They generally have moderate surf, golden or dark sand ranging through fine, medium or coarse in texture, and some gravel. The occupancy rate is usually high to midrange, especially during the summer months, when tourist arrivals are highest. Amongst the various notable beaches are Artola beach, situated in the protected area of the Dunas de Artola, and Cabopino, one of the few nudist beaches in Marbella, near the port of Cabopino. The beaches of Venus and La Fontanilla are centrally located and very popular, and those of Puerto Banús and San Pedro Alcántara have been awarded the blue flag of the [[Foundation for Environmental Education]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Playas de Marbella |url=http://www.webmalaga.com/turismo/playas/home.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030508112735/http://www.webmalaga.com/turismo/playas/home.asp  |archive-date=8 May 2003 |publisher=Webmalaga.com |access-date=23 April 2013 }}</ref> for compliance with its standards of water quality, safety, general services and environmental management.

==Politics and administration==
Political administration of the municipal government is run by the Ayuntamiento (City Hall), whose members are elected every four years. Maria Angeles Muñoz, leader of the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP) in Marbella, became mayor in 2007, and her party has governed the town ever since. The electoral roll is composed of all residents registered in Marbella who are over age 18 and a citizen of Spain or one of the other member states of the European Union. The Spanish Law on the General Election sets the number of councilors elected according to the municipality's population;<ref>{{cite web|title=Ley Orgánica 5/1985, de 19 de junio, del Régimen Electoral General|url=http://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-1985-11672|work=Boletín Oficial del Estado| pages=19110–19134 |publisher=Gobierno de España, Ministero de la Presidencia|access-date=15 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223032404/http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/1985/06/20/pdfs/A19110-19134.pdf|archive-date=23 December 2011}}</ref> the Municipal Corporation of Marbella consists of 27 councilors.

===Gil Cases===
Corruption accusations and mayor Gil's further conviction in 2002 for diverting public funds to Atlético led to reappraisal of the city's finances. When Jesús Gil y Gil finally resigned that year, he was succeeded by Julián Muñoz, his right-hand man, a former waiter famous for his romantic involvement with singer [[Isabel Pantoja]], a matador's widow.<ref name="economist.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/2012229|title=The man from Marbella|newspaper=The Economist|date=21 August 2003|access-date=15 October 2018}}</ref> After a power struggle in which Muñoz fired Juan Antonio Roca Nicolas, a planning consultant, for involvement in the Gil-era scandal and in the later scandal discussed below, the city council censured the new mayor and expelled him from office. More than 79 companies and 85 individuals were implicated in the initial corruption scandal (for which Roca had been released from prison upon paying a 450,000 euro fine), and an additional fifty persons and more companies were convicted in June 2013. In a televised debate, Muñoz and Gil each accused the other of having robbed public funds.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spain's politics: The man from Marbella|url=http://www.economist.com/node/2012229|publisher=The Economist|access-date=14 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823142024/http://www.economist.com/node/2012229|archive-date=23 August 2012|date=21 August 2003}}</ref>

After his own party repudiated Muñoz, Marisol Yagüe, a former secretary, became Marbella's new mayor, but was herself arrested and jailed in March 2006. Deputy Mayor Isabel Garcia Marcos was arrested at Malaga's airport en route to a honeymoon in Russia at this time, and police found over €360,000 in cash in a safe in her home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/especiales/2006/04/espana/corrupcion_marbella/quien.html|title=Corrupción en Marbella|website=Elmundo.es|access-date=15 October 2018}}</ref> Garcia, a Socialist until her expulsion from that party in 2003, had been known for criticizing Marbella's endemic corruption. Gil died in 2004, a year after Spain's Supreme Court barred him from holding further public office for 28 years for breach of trust and influence-peddling in the earlier cases, as well as shortly after a lower court ordered him to surrender his Atlético shares and fined him $16 million in connection with the 2002 conviction (but allowed him to remain free on bail during his appeal).<ref name="economist.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2006/10/spai-o17.html|title=Marbella construction scandal exposes endemic criminality of Spanish capitalism|first=John|last=Vassilopoulos|date=17 October 2006 |access-date=15 October 2018}}</ref>

===Operation Malaya===
{{see also|Marbella City Council dissolution}}
In March 2006, Marbella seemed nearly bankrupt. City councilor [[Tomás Reñones]], a former Atlético Madrid football player, ran Marbella after Mayor Yague and Deputy Mayor Garcia were jailed, but soon ended up in jail as well. On 8 April 2006, the Spanish Senate unanimously approved the report of the General Commission of Autonomous Communities and [[Marbella City Council dissolution|suspended the city council]], the first time such a course of action had occurred in Spain since democracy's restoration.<ref>{{cite web |title=Marbella awaits new elections after most local politicians are accused of corruption |url=http://www.citymayors.com/politics/marbella_corruption.html|publisher=City Mayors|access-date=14 April 2013|author=Daniel González Herrera |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123151059/http://www.citymayors.com/politics/marbella_corruption.html |archive-date=23 January 2013|date=16 November 2006}}</ref> Spain's Prime Minister, [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]], head of the national PSOE, appointed a committee of auditors to run Marbella temporarily, as well as unravel the financial machinations.

During the complex, three-year trial (which included over 300 hours of hearings and 400 witnesses), evidence showed that under a scheme masterminded by Roca (a formerly unemployed builder who ran the city's planning department in the 1990s), building permits were issued in exchange for envelopes of cash, and the money then illegally laundered. Although prosecutors had sought even stiffer terms after convicting 50 municipal officials and business executives, in October 2013, Roca was sentenced to 11 years in jail and fined €240m, former mayor Muñoz sentenced to six years, and former mayor Yagüe sentenced to serve two years in prison.

[[File:Meliá Don Pepe.jpg|thumb|Hotel Don Pepe, designed by Eleuterio Población, opened in 1963]]
According to 2003 data, Marbella is amongst the municipalities ranking highest in household disposable income per capita in Andalusia, second to Mojácar and matched by four other municipalities, including its neighbour, Benahavís.

Its business sector consisted of 17,647 establishments in 2005, representing a total of 14.7% of the businesses in Malaga province, and showed greater dynamism than the provincial capital itself for growth over the period 1998–2004, when it grew 9% compared to the 2.4% growth rate of Málaga. Compared to the rest of Andalusia, the volume of production in Marbella is higher than that of most other municipalities with similar population, ranking even above the capitals of Almería, Huelva and Jaén.
[[File:Marbella3.jpg|left|thumb|[[Puerto Banús]]]]

As in most cities of the Andalusian coast, Marbella's economy revolves around tertiary activities. The service sector accounts for 60% of employment, while trade accounts for almost 20%.  The main branches of the service sector are hospitality, [[real estate]], and business services, which underscores the importance of tourism in Marbella's economy.  Employment in construction, industry, and agriculture is 14.2%, 3.8%, and 2.4% respectively.
