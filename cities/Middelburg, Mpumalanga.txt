==Demographics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2022}}
Hundreds of expatriates and their families, mostly from the United Kingdom and parts of Europe, moved into the town in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s to avoid the slump of the post-World War II industrial and manufacturing sectors in those countries. These families were attracted by the need for industrial expertise in the plant, and were often rewarded with company-sponsored housing and discounted education.

The children of those immigrant families have either moved to the larger nearby cities of Witbank, Pretoria and Johannesburg, seeking employment, or have remained to form part of the growing alternative economic activities in the area.

Today, the town faces many issues typical to smaller towns in South Africa. These include challenges such as the incorporation, upliftment, and appropriate addressing of former inequalities of service provision and infrastructure in the large nearby townships and suburbs, that were created for the black and Indian populations, under apartheid laws. The cultural make up of the town is quite diverse, ranging from mainly [[Afrikaans]]-speaking families, expatriates from the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Europe]], as well as the indigenous [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] populations. Another challenge is addressing the general trend of the hastening migration of residents away from small towns to larger cities in search of greater economic opportunities.

With a 2016 population of 278,000 and a growth rate of 4.9%, the municipal statistical department has estimated that the population will be 500,000 by 2030. The town has one of the largest police forces in the region, a government (public) hospital and clinic, as well as a private hospital, shopping mall and several public schools.

===Religion===
Middelburg has a deep Christian origin, for the oldest Dutch Reformed church is the one mentioned above which is better known as "Die Witkerk."

Churches in the town are:
* The Dutch Reformed (NG Kerk)
* Nederduitsch Hervormde Kerk van Afrika (Nederduits Reformed Church of Africa) since 01.04.1864 - 2 parishes, Middelburg and Middelburg-Noord 28.08.1977
* AFM-AGS Apostolic Faith Mission (Lighuis Gemeente, Corpus Christi, AGS Sentraal)
* Pentecostal Protestant Church(Lofdal Gesinskerk, Woord-en-Kruis Gemeente.)
* Baptist
* [[New Independent Fundamentalist Baptist]]
* Methodist
*African Methodist Episcopal Church (Nazareth Chapel) 
* Catholic
* Full Gospel Church (VEK Presence Church)
* Zion Christian Church
* Holy Trinity Anglican Church 
* Independent Churches
* Evangelical Lutheran Church
*Lutheran Bapedi Church 
*St Peter's Confessional Lutheran Church of South Africa 
* Presbyterian
* ECF (Eastdene Christian Fellowship) 1988
*Shalom Christian Church
* Solid Ground Church

Various bazaars and markets are held by all churches in support of the community. Examples would be ''The Expo'' Art and craft market, which is held annually in the spring by ''Die Lighuis Gemeente''. ''Corpus Christi'' also have a world class market which is widely known in the area as the ''Kersmark''. The church community is closely involved in community upliftment and development.

==Economy==
Columbus Stainless, a large [[stainless steel]] plant, constructed in 1965, and Thos Begbie & Co, a company established in 1887 by Scotsman Thomas Begbie, are both situated here. For many years, the industrial activities of the steel plant and its peripheral activities, such as coal and transport, provided much of the employment and largely drove the economy of the town, although other sectors, such as agriculture, have gradually grown to be important.

==Culture and contemporary life==
