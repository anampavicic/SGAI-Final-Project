Other important industrial sectors which have helped fuel the economic engines of the region include [[meat production]] (cattle), manufacturing industries like shoe, basket, and ceramics production. A fact that perhaps is not widely known is that it was in Táchira State, and not in [[Zulia State]], that the first oil wells were excavated in 1875 (located in the Petrolea sector close to [[Rubio, Venezuela|Rubio]])-- a procedure done in those days by hand and with buckets. It is a commercial, transportation, and industrial center. [[Textile]]s, [[leather]] products, [[cement]],<ref>BritannicaAcademicEdition</ref> and [[tobacco]] are produced, and [[coffee]], [[sugar]], [[pineapple]]s, and [[maize|corn]] are exported.

One of the most celebrated festivities which attracts visitors from all over is the [[Feria Internacional de San Sebastián]] held annually at Pueblo Nuevo next to Táchira state football club's grounds.

Nearby small businesses, in particular eateries, restaurants and small independent retailers thrive of the activities in Pueblo nuevo.

Places to visit in and around San Cristóbal include all the squares and parks around the city, the enchanting colonial town of [[San Pedro del Río]] and Peribeca. During Christmas these towns are full of decorations and mangers of every shape and size. Near the border with [[Colombia]] is the town of [[San Antonio de Táchira]], with its lively commercial beat. Other interesting towns are Palmira and Abejales, above the town of Tariba, famous for their sugar cane baskets, and the town of [[El Topón]], a typical agricultural town. The water fall of Chorro el Indio is an entertaining place to visit and be surrounded by nature.

Plaza de los Mangos, in Barrio Obrero, is a popular youth hangout close to San Cristobal's city centre. A leafy square home to music shops, imported clothing retailers, Mini malls, nightclubs, eateries, ice-cream parlours, pool halls, Internet cafés, and small music venues, Plaza de los Mangos has become a busy hub for youth life.
