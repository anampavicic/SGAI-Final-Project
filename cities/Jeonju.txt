'''Jeonju''' ({{Lang-ko|전주}}, {{IPA|ko|t͡ɕʌɲ.d͡ʑu}}, {{Literal translation|Perfect region}}){{efn|The name Jeonju literally means "Perfect Region" (from the [[hanja]] {{lang|ko|{{linktext|全}}}} [{{lang|ko|전}}; jeon] for perfect, {{lang|ko|{{linktext|州}}}} [{{lang|ko|주}}; ju] for region)}} is the capital and [[List of cities in South Korea|largest city]] of [[North Jeolla Province]], South Korea. It is both urban and rural due to the closeness of [[Wanju County]] which almost entirely surrounds Jeonju (Wanju County has many residents who work in Jeonju). It is an important tourist center famous for Korean food, historic buildings, sports activities, and innovative festivals.

In May 2012, Jeonju was chosen as a Creative City for [[Gastronomy]] as part of [[UNESCO]]'s [[Creative Cities Network]]. This honour recognizes the city's traditional home cooking handed down over thousands of years, its active public and private food research, a system of nurturing talented chefs, and its hosting of distinctive food festivals.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jeonju's Gastronomic Greatness Recognized by UNESCO|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/05/16/2012051600865.html|access-date=23 May 2012|newspaper=[[The Chosun Ilbo]]|date=16 May 2012|archive-date=May 19, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519030415/http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/05/16/2012051600865.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Geography and administrative divisions ==
[[File:Jeonju City Hall 20230408 004.jpg|thumb|Jeonju City Hall]]

===Administrative divisions===
Jeonju is divided into two wards, [[Deokjin District]] and [[Wansan District]] that, in turn, are divided into approximately 40 neighborhoods.

===Climate===
Jeonju has a cooler version of a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cwa''), with winter being warm enough to avoid being classified as an [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] (''Dwa'') if the 0&nbsp;°C isotherm is used.

Jeonju, like all of Korea, has four distinct seasons (spring, summer, fall, and winter). The winters can have a mix of days that are cool to days that are quite cold. The colder days are often influenced by a high pressure front that brings cold air from Siberia.

In the summer, the humidity of Southeast Asia comes over the Korean peninsula from June through September. Temperatures in spring (late April and through May) and fall (after September 25 and through October) are often in the mid-20s°C and with low humidity.

== History ==
===Samguk (1C BC–7C AD)===
The [[Baekje]] kingdom was located in southwestern Korea which included the area Jeonju is now located. It is believed that Jeonju was founded as a market town within Baekje around 57 BC.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|year=1996|isbn=1-884964-04-4|editor-last=Schellinger|editor-first=Paul|location=Chicago|pages=195–197|editor-last2=Salkin|editor-first2=Robert}}</ref>

Jeonju (along with Baekje in general) was conquered by the kingdom of [[Silla]] in 660 AD. It soon became part of the Silla kingdom and in 685, Jeonju became one of the nine ''chu'' (a provincial capital of the kingdom). From 889 and onward, peasant revolts (caused from over taxation) became widespread throughout the kingdom and it also spread to Jeonju where it became the headquarters of one of the most powerful rebel leaders of the time, Gyeon Hwon. In 892 (or 900), Gyeon Hwon renamed the city Wansan and established it as the capital of the [[Later Baekje]] kingdom. From Wansan, Gyeon Hwon campaigned against Silla which climaxed with the destruction of [[Geumseong]] (the capital of the Silla kingdom) and the assassination of King [[Gyeongae of Silla|Gyeongae]] in 927. With the decline of Silla, Gyeon Hwon and [[Taejo of Goryeo|Wang Geon]] (of the [[Goryeo]] kingdom) waged battle for control of the peninsula. However, Wang Geon and his forces invaded Later Baekje in 934 and Jeonju surrendered to him in 935.<ref name=":0" />

===Goryeo (918–1392)===
Under [[Goryeo]] rule, Jeonju reverted to being a provincial capital and enjoyed relative stability and economic growth. However, in 1182, the city was taken by peasant rebels with the aid of governmental troops stationed there who resented being forced to do heavy labor along slaves. The rebellion was soon suppressed forty days after it began.<ref name=":0" />

===Joseon (1392–1897)===
The [[Joseon]] defeated Goryeo and founded a new dynasty in 1392 and took all their possessions including Jeonju. The Joseon considered Jeonju their ancestral home (an ancestor of [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seonggye]] of Joseon may have fled Jeonju after the 1182 peasant revolt). During the Joseon period, Jeonju became the capital of a reorganized Jeolla (one of the eight provinces of the Joseon). In 1413, Jeonju (along with three other cities) was given the honor of safekeeping copies of the ''Annals of the Joseon Dynasty'' which still survives extant in the former Confucian academy in Jeonju.<ref name=":0" />

The town was occupied by the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]] in 1894.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-WlUd3cjh0C&q=Donghak+peasants+jeonju&pg=PT111|title=A Brief History of Korea, Volume 1|isbn=9788973006199|author1=신형식|date=January 2005|access-date=October 2, 2020|archive-date=April 4, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230404061353/https://books.google.com/books?id=o-WlUd3cjh0C&q=Donghak+peasants+jeonju&pg=PT111|url-status=live}}</ref> Jeonju was [[Korea under Japanese rule|occupied by the Japanese]] beginning from 1910 to 1945, and was renamed to Zenshū during the period. The ancient walls of the old city were destroyed by the Japanese authorities with the Pungnammun(풍남문) Gate being the only remnant left today. Jeonju's population grew between 1925 and 1949 when it reached 100,000 inhabitants.<ref name=":0" /> Jeonju was given metropolitan status in 1935, and the city was founded in 1949. During the [[Division of Korea]], Jeonju was not in the immediate frontline of the war but by the armistice signing in July 1953, Jeonju (along with many other cities) suffered bombardment and the loss of many male residents who fought during the war.<ref name=":0" />

===Today===
Jeonju was given its modern boundaries and government system in 1963. It has since then industrialized rapidly.<ref name=":0" /> Since the Joseon dynasty period, it was a metropolis, but it did not experience industrialization in the 20th century compared to other parts of Korea. It does not have the industrial infrastructure, manufacturing, or heavy industries found in other major Korean cities. Today, traditional tourism and sightseeing is a major industry in the city.
