'''Caxias do Sul''' ({{IPA|pt|kaˈʃi.ɐz du ˈsuw}}) is a city in [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Southern Brazil]], situated in the state's mountainous [[Serra Gaúcha]] region. It was established by [[Italian Brazilian|Italian immigrant]]s on June 20, 1890. Today it is the second [[Largest cities in Rio Grande do Sul by population|largest city]] in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. In 2020, the population of Caxias do Sul was estimated at 517,451 people, many of whom are of Italian and German descent. The demonym of the citizens of Caxias do Sul is ''Caxiense''.<ref name="i">{{cite web |url= https://cidades.ibge.gov.br/brasil/rs/caxias-do-sul/|title= Caxias do Sul|language=pt |publisher=Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística | place = Brasília, Brazil |year=2017 |access-date=December 20, 2017}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Main|History of Caxias do Sul}}
[[File:Colonos-caxienses.jpg|thumb|left|Italian immigrants in Caxias do Sul, 1918.]]
[[File:Caxias do Sul, Fundo Correio da Manhã.tif|left|thumb|Caxias do Sul in 1971.]]

The history of Caxias do Sul began before the arrival of the Italian immigrants when the region was being roamed by cattlemen and occupied by [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Indigenous peoples]]. The region was called "Indians' Field" in that period. The arrival of Italian immigrants, mostly farmers in search of a better life from the [[Veneto]], [[Lombardy]], [[Trento]] ([[northern Italy]]) as well as other regions in Italy, began in 1875 in [[Nova Milano]]. Although they received governmental support such as tools, supplies, and seeds, everything had to be reimbursed to the federal government.<ref name="Nome">[http://www.caxias.rs.gov.br/cidade/index.php?codigo=2 ''Nome''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117104000/https://www.caxias.rs.gov.br/cidade/index.php?codigo=2 |date=November 17, 2015 }}.

Caxias do Sul: Universidade de Caxias do Sul, 7 e 8 de Julho de 2006. pp. 3–5</ref>

Two years later, the colonial headquarters of the Indians' Field was given the name Caxias Colony. The town was created on July 20, 1890, and acknowledged in the same year, on August 24.<ref name="Nome"/> Many economic cycles marked the evolution of the city throughout that century. The first one is connected to the most significant aspect of its cultural identity: the cultivation of vineyards and the production of wine, first for its own consumption, and later on, for commercialization.<ref name="Giron">Giron, pp. 10–12</ref>

On June 1, 1910, Caxias do Sul was elevated to the category of city. On the same day, the first train arrived connecting the region to the state capital. Although the immigrants were farmers, many of them worked in other economic sectors. They settled down, urbanized the region, and started a fast-paced process of industrialization.<ref>Sales, Fabiana de Lima. ''O desenvolvimento econômico de Caxias do Sul na perspectiva do acervo do Museu Municipal''. Universidade de Caxias do Sul, 2006. p. 2</ref>

In the countryside, [[subsistence agriculture]] concentrates on the cultivation of grapes, wheat, and corn. Home-based manufacturing started to emerge and overproduction was commercialized. Home-based manufacturing and Caxias do Sul evolved from having small home-based workshops to large scale factories, some of which are known internationally.<ref name="Giron"/>

Nowadays, Caxias do Sul is an important city, and due to its industrious colonists, is home to vast vineyards, wineries, a varied industrial park, and a rich and dynamic market. Those attributes grant the land great importance; for such reason Caxias do Sul is often called "Pearl of the Colonies", is considered the center of the Italian presence in Southern Brazil.<ref>Giron, pp. 12–13</ref><ref>Machado, Maria Abel & Herédia, Vania Beatriz Merlotti. "Associação dos Comerciantes: Uma Forma de Organização dos Imigrantes Europeus nas Colônias Agrícolas no Sul do Brasil". In ''Scripta Nova. Revista Electrónica de Geografía y Ciencias Sociales''.

Caxias do Sul: UCS, 2002. pp. 137–144.</ref>

Today Caxias do Sul is one of the region's central hubs, hosting some of Brazil's most diverse economies besides its size; with its industrial parks, vast vineyards, wine commerce, cattle and plantation farms give the land a further dimension.

==Caxiense==
A ''Caxiense'' ({{IPA|pt|kaʃiˈẽsi}}) is a citizen of the city of Caxias do Sul. A possible anglicization of Caxiense would be ''Caxian''. Caxiense is also the name of a bus line with headquarters in Caxias do Sul. Caxiense provides transport service with a fleet of coaches to cities in the [[Serra Gaúcha]]. Caxiense also offers a bus service from Caxias do Sul to [[Porto Alegre]] and the Porto Alegre [[Salgado Filho International Airport]].

Culture in Caxias do Sul was not greatly favoured by the first Italian settlers, as they were mostly involved with survival concerns in an area until then unexplored. In the beginning of the 20th century, however, there was some cultural interest developing, and some sculptors, painters and [[House painter and decorator|decorator]]s made a significant career in the city and around, like as [[Pietro Stangherlin]], [[Francisco Meneguzzo]] and the Zambelli family. They left the first examples of artworks worth of mention, specially in [[sacred art]] and building decoration. [[Julio Calegari]] and [[Ulysses Geremia]], both photographers, also deserve close attention for their huge collections of [[portrait]]s and views of the old city.<ref>Tedesco, João Carlos.

As of historical architecture, one may find a few [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] houses built for rich families, public buildings and [[Neo-Gothic]] churches, like as the Cathedral and the [[Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre]].
