== History of Artchesh ==
During [[Classical Antiquity]], the town was known as Arsissa, and Archesh (Arčeš) in Armenian and Arjish in Arabic.<ref>{{citation|title=A History of the Crusades, Volume I: The first hundred years|url=http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/History.CrusOne|page=630|year=1969|editor-last=Baldwin|editor-first=M.W.|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press}}</ref> The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] knew it as Arzes (Ἂρζες or Ἀρζές) and the 10th-century emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos]] wrote in his ''[[De administrando imperio]]'' (Chapter XLIV) that it was under the rule of the [[Kaysites|Kaysite]] [[emirate]] of [[Manzikert]]. 

This small district served as the [[Capital (political)|capital]] city of a number of ruling states. It was the main center of the province of [[Turuberan]] as part of the ancient [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. The city changed hands on several occasions between the Arabs and the Byzantines, in the early Middle Ages. From the mid 1020s onwards Archesh was governed by the Byzantines. In 1054, it was captured and sacked by the [[Seljuk Turks]] commanded by [[Tughril|Tuğrul]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sinclair|first=T. A.|title=Eastern Turkey: An Architectural & Archaeological Survey, Volume I|date=1987|publisher=Pindar Press|isbn=0907132324|pages=328|language=en}}</ref> after an eight-day siege. It was fortified in the early 14th century by the [[Ilkhanid]] [[vizier]] Ali Shah. Archesh became part of the [[Qara Qoyunlu]] state and later became a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. 

From 18th century, because of the increase of level of [[Lake Van]] the old town (called Archesh) slowly disappeared. By the second half of the 19th century few traces of the buildings, churches and dwelling houses remained. After old Archesh/Erciş was flooded by water, the city was moved to north to a much higher place called Alada in 1841. There the new town was built called Akants (Նոր Արճեշ ({{IPA-hy|ɑɾtʃɛʃ}}, New Artchesh in Armenian and Erciş ({{IPA|tr|eɾdʒiʃ}}) in Turkish).<ref>[[Tadevos Hakobyan]], [http://armenianhouse.org/hakobyan-t/5-cities.html#6 ՊԱՏՄԱԿԱՆ ՀԱՅԱՍՏԱՆԻ ՔԱՂԱՔՆԵՐԸ  - ԱՐՃԵՇ ''(The cities of Historical Armenia - Archesh)''], Yerevan, 1987.</ref> While the new site inherited the old city's name and identity, as well as most of the population, some of the old site's residents moved out into the surrounding countryside instead and settled in villages such as Çelebibaği.<ref name="Sinclair 1987"/> In 1890 64% of the population of the district was Armenian. 

The Armenian population was wiped out during the [[Armenian genocide]] of 1915. That same year [[Russia]]n forces captured the city during the [[Caucasus Campaign]]. They were replaced by makeshift Armenian forces after December 1917. These were eventually driven out by the Ottomans on April 1, 1918. 

In July 1930 in Erçis occurred the [[Zilan massacre|Zilan Massacre]] in which the Turkish army massacred thousands of Kurds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.refworld.org/docid/4cab061bc.html|title=Refworld {{!}} Freedom of the Press 2010 - Turkey|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|website=Refworld|language=en|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref> 

The city was shaken by a [[2011 Van earthquakes|major earthquake]] on 23 October 2011.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/12/3337/2012/nhess-12-3337-2012.pdf|title=Van earthquakes (23 October 2011 and 9 November 2011) and performance of masonry and adobe structures|last=Güney|first=D.|website=Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences|access-date=1 March 2020}}</ref>

== Government ==
[[Kaymakam|District Governor]] Nuri Mehmetbeyoğlu was appointed as a trustee for the Erçis municipality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/trustees-appointed-to-four-hdp-municipalities-in-turkeys-southeast-147828|title=Trustees appointed to four HDP municipalities in Turkey's southeast - Turkey News|website=Hürriyet Daily News|language=en|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref>

== Population ==
The total population of the district at the end of 2022 was 171,000.<ref name=tuik/>

== Geography ==
The district covers an area of 2,133&nbsp;km² and is surrounded by Muradiye District to the east, [[Bitlis Province]] to the west, [[Ağrı Province]] on the north and by [[Lake Van]] on the south. There is a volcanic mountain and caldera called  [[Mount Meydan]] in the district.

To the north of Erciş is a large, steep highland area known as the Ala Dağ (literally "mottled mountain"), which contains the tributaries of the [[Zilan Dere]].<ref name="Sinclair 1987">{{cite book |last1=Sinclair |first1=T.A. |title=Eastern Turkey: An Architectural & Archaeological Survey, Volume I |date=1987 |publisher=Pindar Press |location=London |isbn=0-907132-32-4 |pages=271, 273, 279-81 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EK1EBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA273 |access-date=20 May 2022}}</ref> This is part of a general highland belt that separates the small plains north of Lake Van from the districts of [[Doğubayazıt]] and [[Diyadin]] further north.<ref name="Sinclair 1987"/> The [[Mount Süphan]] and [[Nemrut (volcano)|Mount Nemrut]] further west are also part of this highland belt, as is the [[Mount Tendürek]] immediately to the east.<ref name="Sinclair 1987"/> The Ala Dağ's underlying rock is fairly soft and as a result the whole area is eroded into many sharp ridges.<ref name="Sinclair 1987"/> However, many of these ridges are covered in grass.<ref name="Sinclair 1987"/> There are villages in some of the valleys in the Ala Dağ, and there was historically a route cutting through some of these valleys to reach Diyadin further north.<ref name="Sinclair 1987"/> Historical records also refer to an "Ala Dağ" as the site of an [[Ilkhanid]] palace and a grazing area for [[Mongol]] pastoralists, but this seems to be referring to a different place.<ref name="Sinclair 1987"/>

It is one of the most developed cities in eastern Turkey and it is the place where the [[folk song]]s are still alive. Many kinds of [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s are raised. Planting of [[Populus|poplar]] trees is widely seen in the city and surroundings.

===Climate===
Erciş has a dry-summer [[continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dsb''/''Dsa''),<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Table 1 Overview of the Köppen-Geiger climate classes including the defining criteria. |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02549-6/tables/1 |journal=Nature: Scientific Data |language=en}}</ref> with hot, dry summers, and cold winters.
