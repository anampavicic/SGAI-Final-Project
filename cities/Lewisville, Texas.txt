'''Lewisville''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|uː|ɪ|s|v|ɪ|l}} {{respell|LOO|iss|vil}}) is a city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]], located in [[Denton County, Texas|Denton County]] with portions extending into [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]]. As one of the [[Mid-Cities]] within the [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex]], the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]] reported a population of 111,822.<ref name="2020 Census (City)">{{cite web|title=Explore Census Data |url=https://data.census.gov/profile/Lewisville_city,_Texas?g=160XX00US4842508 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=October 16, 2023}}</ref>

Originally called Holford's Prairie, Lewisville dates back to the early 1840s.{{sfn|Capace|1999|p=437}} The arrival of the town's first railroad in 1881 engendered its initial growth, and the expansion of the area's transportation infrastructure spurred further development in the early part of the 20th century.{{sfn|Cole-Jett|2011|p=9}} Lewisville [[Local government in the United States|incorporated]] in 1925, and when construction of Lewisville Lake was completed in the 1950s, the city began to expand rapidly.

Lewisville's proximity to [[Lewisville Lake]] has made it a recreational hub of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. The area's transportation infrastructure has evolved around the [[I-35 Corridor]] along [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|Interstate 35E]]. The diversity of its population and industry has created a stable economic climate. [[Lewisville Independent School District]] provides most of the area's public education programs.

==History==

===Settlement===
In 1841, the [[Republic of Texas]] chartered the [[Peters Colony]] Land Grant Company (named for William Smalling Peters, publisher of the song "[[Oh! Susanna]]"){{sfn|Capace|1999|p=437}} to settle the [[North Texas]] area.{{sfn|Cole-Jett|2011|p=9}} In 1844, John W. King and his wife settled on the east side of the prairie, where the city now lies. Baptist settlers from [[Platte County, Missouri]], settled on the west side; among them were John and James Holford, who named the area Holford's Prairie.{{sfn|Cowling|1936|p=16}}{{sfn|Bates|1918|p=29}} Further south, Presbyterians established a church and called it [[Flower Mound, Texas|Flower Mound]].{{sfn|Bates|1918|p=31}}  In the confusion over land ownership after the [[Hedgcoxe War]], Basdeal Lewis purchased Holford's Prairie in 1853 and renamed it after himself.{{sfn|Cole-Jett|2011|p=7}}

In 1845, the Fox family, which owned about a dozen slaves, buried a slave child called Melinda on the family farm, which eventually became the town's cemetery for black residents. Named Fox–Hembry Cemetery, the plot still exists today.{{sfn|Cole-Jett|2011|p=48}} After it had fallen into disrepair, local residents and businesses gathered to restore it in 2011.{{sfn|Southwell|2011}} Though [[Abraham Lincoln]] was not on the ballot in the area for the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 Presidential election]], residents of Lewisville (listed as "Hollforts" on election results) still gave [[John C. Breckinridge]] only a 44–31 majority over an [[electoral fusion]] option.{{sfn|Bridges|1978|p=94}}

During [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]], Lewisville became home to [[Denton County, Texas|Denton County's]] first [[cotton gin]]. Built in 1867, it could produce up to three bales per day.{{sfn|Bates|1918|p=278}}{{sfn|Bridges|1978|p=121}} The [[Thirteenth Texas Legislature]] chartered the Dallas and Wichita Railroad (later the [[Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad|Missouri–Kansas–Texas]]) on terms requiring 20 miles of track to be in running order by July 1, 1875. Lewisville paid the company $15,000 to come to the city, with a promise of another $5,000 on completion.{{sfn|Bridges|1978|p=147}}  The company fulfilled the deal by completing the railroad tracks to a point just south of Lewisville on the morning of the deadline, and the line began running full-time in 1881.{{sfn|Bates|1918|p=172}}{{sfn|Cole-Jett|2011|p=9}} Republicans in the [[Fourteenth Texas Legislature]] passed a law on April 30, 1874, prohibiting alcohol within two miles of the town.{{sfn|Gammel|1898|p=595}} Many residents ignored the law, however, and the city retained as many as 17 saloons at one point.{{sfn|Bates|1918|p=146}} The population of the unincorporated town was 500 in 1888.{{sfn|Foster|1888|p=55}}

===Progress===
[[File:Lewisville Theater Old Town.jpg|alt=Photograph of an old theater sign on a rustic building.|thumb|upright|The building currently housing the Greater Lewisville Community Theater, built in 1885, is the oldest standing structure in Lewisville.{{sfn|GLCT|2006}}]]
On January 15, 1925, residents voted by a margin of 17 votes to [[Municipal corporation|incorporate]] Lewisville, which established its official boundaries as a city.{{sfn|Hervey|2002|p=26}} By 1930, Lewisville's population had increased to 853, making it the fourth-most populous municipality in Denton County (behind [[Denton, Texas|Denton]], [[Sanger, Texas|Sanger]], and [[Pilot Point, Texas|Pilot Point]]).{{sfn|Bridges|1978|p=367}}

Because the city's economy had become diversified before the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], Lewisville was relatively well insulated from the [[Great Depression]]. Many residents, including business leaders, nevertheless supported the [[New Deal]] programs of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].{{sfn|Cole-Jett|2011|p=25}}{{sfn|Degan|1991|pp=21–23}} By 1936, the [[Works Progress Administration]] operated a cannery in the city to provide temporary jobs for unemployed residents.{{sfn|Bridges|1978|p=371}} As an extension of the [[Good Roads Movement]], which had been prominent in Denton County since the early 1910s,{{sfn|Almanac|1912|p=279}} residents formed the Good Roads Committee of Lewisville to lobby state and federal officials for funding to create better streets.{{sfn|Cole-Jett|2011|pp=27–32}}{{sfn|Bridges|1978|p=287}} Lewisville celebrated the paving of the [[U.S. Route 77 in Texas|U.S. Route 77]] between Denton and [[Dallas]] in 1931 with a "Coming Out of the Mud" ceremony. The new pavement closed the "Lewisville Gap" between the two cities, a stretch of dirt road through the city that often became too muddy for travel.{{sfn|Odom|1996|p=69}}

The new road also led indirectly to the downfall of the area's public transportation system. Between 1925 and 1932, the Texas Interurban Railway, an electric [[commuter rail]] service that ran from Dallas to Denton, operated a station in Lewisville. Business leaders in the Lewisville Chamber of Commerce welcomed the service at the time, proudly citing the city's [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] citizenship.{{sfn|Tunnell|Moore|Minor|1925|p=15}} The area's low population density could not sustain the venture, however, and in 1932, the line went out of business and immediately halted service.{{sfn|Moynihan|2007|p=6}}{{sfn|Cochran|1992|p=15}}

On April 25, 1934, [[Raymond Hamilton]] of the [[Barrow gang]] robbed the First National Bank of Lewisville. Residents chased him to [[Howe, Texas]], where he was captured at a roadblock and transferred to Dallas County Jail.{{sfn|Cole-Jett|2011|p=52}}{{sfn|Riddell|1934}}

===Growth===
Lewisville's rapid growth began when construction of the Garza–Little Elm Dam finished in 1954, expanding the Garza–Little Elm Reservoir into what is now [[Lewisville Lake]].{{sfn|Cole-Jett|2011|p=99}}  The city adopted a [[Home Rule in the United States|home-rule]] charter for a [[Council–manager government|council–manager]] style of municipal government in 1963, becoming one of only a few home-rule cities in Texas with a population less than 5,000.{{sfn|Almanac|1964|pp=553–554}} In September 1969, 13 days after [[Woodstock]], the city hosted the [[Texas International Pop Festival]], which drew over 150,000 spectators and featured performances by [[Janis Joplin]], [[B.B. King]], and [[Led Zeppelin]].{{sfn|Wilonsky|2011}} In 2011, the [[Texas Historical Commission]] dedicated a historical event marker at the [[Hebron (DCTA station)|Hebron]] [[A-train (Denton County Transportation Authority)|A-train]] station in Lewisville to commemorate the event.{{sfn|Lewis|2011}}

When [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]] opened to the south of the city in 1974 and [[The Vista (Lewisville, Texas)|Vista Ridge Mall]] opened at the intersection of [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|Interstate 35E]] and [[FM 3040|Round Grove Road]] in 1989, Lewisville began to undergo rapid suburban growth.{{sfn|Cole-Jett|2011|p=125}} Its population increased from 24,273 in 1980 to 46,521 in 1990, making it the 40th-most populous city in Texas.{{sfn|Miskura|1990|p=95}} In the early 1990s, the Lewisville Chamber of Commerce marketed the city with the slogan "City of Expanding Horizons".{{sfn|Lewisville COC|1991|p=136}} Its population reached 77,737 in 2000, 95,290 in 2010, and 111,822 in 2020.{{sfn|QuickFacts|2015}}<ref>{{Cite web|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Lewisville city, Texas; United States |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/lewisvillecitytexas/PST045222 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230916221841/https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/lewisvillecitytexas/PST045222 |archive-date=September 16, 2023 |access-date=September 16, 2023 |website=www.census.gov |language=en}}</ref> In November 2021, the city completed the annexation of the Castle Hills development, located northeast of the city, into its boundaries, adding almost 3000 acres and 18,000 residents.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Brown |first=Steve |date=November 15, 2021 |title=4,500-home Castle Hills community is now a part of Lewisville |url=https://www.dallasnews.com/business/real-estate/2021/11/15/4500-home-castle-hills-community-is-now-a-part-of-lewisville/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211219065640/https://www.dallasnews.com/business/real-estate/2021/11/15/4500-home-castle-hills-community-is-now-a-part-of-lewisville/ |archive-date=December 19, 2021 |access-date=September 16, 2023 |website=Dallas News |language=en}}</ref>

==Geography==
Lewisville has a total area of {{convert|42.5|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|6.1|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} is covered by water.{{sfn|Gazetteer|2011}} It lies at the southern end of Denton County and the northern end of the [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex]], in the eastern part of the [[Cross Timbers]] region of Texas between the [[Texas Blackland Prairies]] and the Grand Prairie.{{sfn|Capace|1999|p=437}} Vista Ridge, a small plateau, is in the southeastern corner of Lewisville, and the lowest part of Denton County, at {{convert|484|ft|m}}, is found in the city.{{sfn|Cowling|1936|p=62}} Lewisville sits above the [[Barnett Shale]], a geological formation containing a large quantity of [[Shale gas in the United States|natural shale gas]].{{sfn|Hundley|2011a}}

Water constitutes about 14% of the city's total area,{{sfn|Gazetteer|2011}} including Lewisville Lake, the Elm Fork of the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]], and two local tributaries of the Elm Fork - Prairie Creek and Timber Creek. A [[riparian zone]] encompasses a portion of the city in the southeast.{{sfn|Sales|2007|p=6}} The intersection of the Elm Fork and Lake Lewisville has given rise to a [[River delta|delta]] at the southern end of the lake, extending {{convert|6.9|mi|km}} south.{{sfn|Williams|1991}} The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] has labeled much of the area surrounding the delta as "Zone AE", meaning the area is subject to [[100-year flood]] precautions.{{sfn|FEMA|2011}}

===Climate===
Lewisville's climate is classified as [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]]. Its [[Köppen climate classification]] is ''Cfa'', which means it has a temperate climate, does not have a [[dry season]], and has a hot summer.{{sfn|Peel|Finlayson|McMahon|2007|p=1636}} According to the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], Lewisville is in a [[hardiness zone]] of 8a.{{sfn|USDA|2012}} The city is seldom affected by [[extreme weather]], but [[Hurricane Carla]] in 1961 brought {{convert|86|mph|km/h|adj=on}} winds and caused {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on}} swells on Lewisville Lake.{{sfn|Cole-Jett|2011|p=109}} During heavy rains, Timber Creek can overflow its banks, and on rare occasions, flood some of the surrounding homes.{{sfn|Stoler|2010}} The [[National Weather Service]] defines no official borders for [[Tornado Alley]], but Lewisville is considered to be in it.{{sfn|NCDC|2012}}

[[File:MCL Theater.png|thumb|alt=A nighttime photograph of a building that says "Grand Theater" across the front. |The Lewisville Grand Theater, which opened in 2011{{sfn|Goodwin|2011a}}]]

The Lewisville Grand Theater, known informally as The Grand, is on the east side of Interstate 35E in Lewisville's Old Town. It is a hub for the arts in Lewisville, able to show films, host meetings, and provide a venue for various kinds of artistic performances. The project began in 2004 and aimed to fulfill a long-term goal of building an arts center to coincide with the 2011 opening of the [[Old Town (DCTA station)|Old Town Station]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011b}} The facility opened in January 2011 with a series of performances, children's shows, concerts, and exhibits,{{sfn|Goodwin|2011a}} and the Greater Lewisville Arts Alliance presented the theater with a $25,000 contribution to begin their fundraiser to place a [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] piano in the theater.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011d}} In 2011 and 2012, ''The Flower Mound Connection'' newspaper named the MCL Grand the best events venue in Denton County.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011}}{{sfn|Allen|2012}}

The facility originally was called Medical Center of Lewisville Grand Theater as part of a 10-year naming-rights agreement with the local hospital. It later changed name to Medical City Lewisville Grand Theater when the hospital was rebranded. The naming rights agreement with Medical City Lewisville ended in December 2020 and the facility was renamed Lewisville Grand Theater.

===Media===
Lewisville is served mainly by media from the Dallas area, but a number of niche publications focus on local news. ''The Lewisville Enterprise'' merged with ''The Lewisville Leader'' in 1962. The paper's publisher and editor at the time, U.O. Clements, was a staunch conservative, but vociferously supported the racial integration of [[Lewisville Independent School District]], for which he received many anonymous threats from members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]].{{sfn|Pareti|2000|pp=40–46}} Clements sold the paper to [[Harte-Hanks|Harte-Hanks Community Newspapers]] in 1971.{{sfn|Pareti|2000|p=50}} Star Newspapers, which owned the ''Leader'', was purchased by 1013 Communications in 2012.{{sfn|Mann|2012}} The newspaper is based in [[Plano, Texas]].

The primary freeway running through Lewisville is Interstate 35E, which runs north–south through the city. Before it was built, US Highway 77 (now [[Farm to Market Road 3504|Mill Street]]) was the main through route, connecting the city with Denton to the north and Dallas to the south.{{sfn|Odom|1996|p=69}} In 1998, the [[Texas Department of Transportation]] carried out a [[Transportation in the United States#Funding|Major Investment Study]] to examine the possibility of expanding the section of Interstate 35E between [[Interstate 635 (Texas)|Interstate 635]] and [[U.S. Route 380]],{{sfn|Singh|2013}} the primary focus being an {{Convert|8|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch from [[Texas State Highway 121]] to the bridge crossing Lewisville Lake.{{sfn|Reinecke|2012|p=10}} The project is scheduled to add one general-purpose lane in each direction, in addition to a [[High occupancy/toll and express toll lanes|managed toll lane]].{{sfn|Lewis|2012}} The project is expected to allow the city to substantially renovate its portion of the [[I-35 Corridor]].{{sfn|Hundley|2011c}} Construction on the first phase of the project is projected to begin in summer 2013 and finish in late 2016.{{sfn|Benning|2012}}
