Zakho is known for its celebrations of [[Newroz]].

The population of the town rose from about 30,000 in 1950 to 350,000 in 1992 due to [[Kurds]] fleeing from other areas of the country.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sabar|first=Y.|date=|title=Zāk̲h̲ū|url=|journal=[[Encyclopedia of Islam]]|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_8099}}</ref>

The original settlement may have been on a small island in the [[Khabur (Tigris)|Little Khabur]] river, which flows west through the modern city to form the border between Iraq and [[Turkey]], continuing into the [[Tigris]]. Other important rivers in the area are the Zeriza and the Seerkotik.<ref>http://www.zaxo.at/index.php?page=32 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706095721/http://www.zaxo.at/index.php?page=32 |date=2011-07-06 }} retrieved 15 May 2011</ref>

==History==
{{For timeline}}
[[Gertrude Bell]], the renowned British archaeologist and Arabist who advised British governors in the region in the closing years of the British Mandate, was convinced that Zakho was the same place as the ancient town of Hasaniyeh. She also reported that one of the first Christian missionaries to the region, the [[Order of Preachers|Dominican]] friar [[Poldo Soldini]], was buried there in 1779. His grave was still a [[pilgrimage]] destination in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite book |title= Amurath to Amurath |publisher=Macmillan |last=Bell |first=Gertrude Lothian
|year=1924 |url= https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.106098
|access-date=2009-09-06}}</ref><ref name="Campanile 1953">{{cite web |title= Histoire du Kurdistan
|publisher=Le Kréyé|last=Campanile|first=Giuseppe|year=1953|url= http://www.institutkurde.org/publications/etude_kurdes/pdf/Campanile.pdf
|access-date=2009-09-06}}</ref>

The town is also the site of Zakho castle, of which today only the tower remains, and of Qubad Pasha castle, a hexagonal structure in Zakho cemetery.

According to an oral tradition transmitted by a [[Iraqi Jews|Jewish]] informant from Zakho, Me'allim Levi, Zakho was established in 1568 by Slivani tribesmen, whose territory was stretched south of the location of the town. The family of [[Shamdin Agha]] came originally from the Slivani tribe, settled in Zakho, and became the most prominent family in Zakho. From the late 19th century onwards, the family of Shamdin Agha ruled "all the Muslims, Jews and Christians of Zakho and its surroundings."<ref>Mordcechai Zaken, Jewish Subjects and their Tribal Vhieftains in Kurdistan, 2007: 33-35.</ref> Zakho was known to the [[ancient Greeks]]. In 1844, the traveller [[William Francis Ainsworth]] commented: "The appearance of Zakho in the present day coincides in a remarkable manner with what it was described to be in the time of [[Xenophon]]."

Zakho is a major marketplace with its goods and merchandise serving the Kurdish-controlled area and most of north and central Iraq. Writing in 1818, Campanile{{who|date=April 2020}} described the town as a great trading centre, famous for its [[oak apple|gallnuts]] as well as rice, oil, sesame, wax, lentils and many fruits.<ref name="Campanile 1953" />

Due to its strategic location and the abundance of job opportunities, Zakho has attracted many workers and job seekers from different parts of Iraq and even from [[Syria]] and Turkey. Trade with Turkey is now the major element of the economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,45a5199f2,45a519d32,4a697dee1e,0.html|title=KDP Flexes Muscles in Dohuk|date=2009-07-21|publisher=Institute for War and Peace Reporting|access-date=2009-09-06}}</ref> Oil drilling began in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.institutkurde.org/en/info/foreign-oil-deal-renews-debate-on-kurd-autonomy--1134220944.html|title=Foreign oil deal renews debate on Kurd autonomy|date=2005-12-09|publisher=USA Today|access-date=2009-09-06}}</ref>

====Islamic history====
In Islamic history it is perhaps best remembered as the location of the [[Battle of the Zab]] between the [[Umayyad dynasty|Umayyads]] and the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]].

The river forms the approximate political boundary of [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] area of Iraq today. Its sister, the Little (or Lower) Zab rises in north-western part of [[Kurdistan Province|Kurdistan province]] Iran, in the north of Piranshahr city and flows south-west through Iraq to join the Tigris north of the town of [[Baiji, Iraq|Baiji]]. The Dukan Dam straddles the Little Zab some 150 miles upstream from its confluence with the Tigris River. Constructed between 1954 and 1959, the dam has a total discharge capability of 4,300 cms. The power station, constructed in 1979, holds five water turbines and provides 400 MW of electrical energy.

In 1991, Zakho was the centre of the [[:wikt:safe haven|haven]] established by the British and the Americans in [[Operation Provide Comfort]] to protect the [[Iraqi Kurds]] from being [[massacre]]d by [[Saddam Hussein]] when he responded brutally to the Kurdish rebellion. Most of the inhabitants of the city had fled to the mountains. When the American forces arrived, they described the town as a [[ghost town|ghost city]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA254123&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604210725/http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA254123&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 June 2011|title=Operation Provide Comfort: a model for future operations|last=Cavanaugh|first=John P.|year=1992|publisher=School of advanced military studies, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas|access-date=2009-09-06}}</ref>

The 27 February [[1995 Zakho bombing]] killed over 50 people. When the [[U.S. Army]] closed its [[military base]] in Zakho in 1996, they evacuated several thousand [[Kurds]] who had connections to the base and who feared reprisals. Many of them were given [[right of asylum|asylum]] in the USA. According to [[David McDowall (British Army officer)|David McDowall]], this constituted a sudden [[brain drain]], with Zakho losing many of its most educated citizens.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dgDi9qFT41oC&q=a+modern+history+of+the+kurds|title=A modern history of the Kurds|last=McDowall|first=David|publisher=Tauris|year=2004|isbn=9781850434160|access-date=2009-09-06}}</ref>

In 2008 it was reported that the [[Turkish Army]] maintained four bases in Zakho District, under an agreement concluded with the [[Iraqi Government]] in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewiStockNews/articleid/2462785|title=Iraqi Kurdish Paper Says Turkish Military Bases Inside Kurdistan Region|date=2008-08-01|publisher=iStockAnalyst|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004135848/http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewiStockNews/articleid/2462785|archive-date=2011-10-04|access-date=2009-09-06|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The [[2011 Dohuk riots]], which targeted [[Assyrians|Assyrian]]-owned businesses, were sparked by Kurdish [[Muslim cleric]]s in the town.<ref name="CNN">{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/03/world/meast/iraq-kurdistan-attack/|title=Kurdish leader: Clerics 'instigated ... acts of sabotage,' wounding 25|last=Tawfeeq|first=Mohammed|date=3 December 2011|newspaper=[[CNN]]|access-date=4 December 2011}}</ref>

The city was the center of a [[Zakho (Chaldean Diocese)|large Chaldean Catholic diocese]] up until the middle of the nineteenth century, when it was divided into three dioceses: Amadia, Zakho, and [[Aqrah|Akra-Zehbar]].{{cn|date=June 2021}} The Armenians of Zakho established their community after the [[Armenian genocide]], with the first Armenian church in the city being established in 1923.<ref>{{cite web |title=Maryam Alazra church –Zakho – Kesta |url=http://www.ishtartv.com/en/viewarticle,35632.html |website=www.ishtartv.com}}</ref>

====Judaism====
{{see also|Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialect of Zakho}}
Zakho was formerly known for its [[synagogue]]s and a large, ancient Jewish community. In the middle of the 19th century, Zakho became the chief spiritual center for the Jews of Kurdistan, and many sources refer to it as yerušalayim de-kurdistan 'the Jerusalem of Kurdistan.'<ref>{{Cite book |last=Aloni |first=Oz |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-HReEAAAQBAJ |title=The Neo-Aramaic Oral Heritage of the Jews of Zakho |date=2022 |publisher=Open Book Publishers |isbn=978-1-80064-304-8 |pages=4 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sabar |first=Yona |title="Zakho," |url=https://www.academia.edu/39766613 |journal=In Norman A.

According to Rabbi Haviv 'Alwan, Zakho was called "Jerusalem of Kurdistan" because Jews living in villages at a walking distance of three or four days from the city had to come there to be ordained as a rabbi, a shohet (ritual slaughterer), or a mohel (a person authorized to perform a circumcision).}}</ref>

The banks of the nearby [[Khabur (Tigris)|Khabur River]] are mentioned in the Bible as one of the places to which the Israelites were exiled (1 Chronicles, 5:26,<ref>{{Cite web |title=BibleHub {{!}} I Chronicles 5:26 |url=https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-26.htm |access-date=2023-07-20 |website=BibleHub.com}}</ref> 2 Kings 17:6,<ref>{{Cite web |title=II Kings 17:6 |url=https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-6.htm |access-date=2023-07-20 |website=Biblehub.com}}</ref> 2 Kings 18:11<ref>{{Cite web |title=II Kings 18:11 |url=https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-11.htm |access-date=2023-07-20 |website=Biblehub.com}}</ref>).

The Jews spoke the [[Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialect of Zakho]] and were also fluent in [[Kurmanji]], the language spoken by non-Jewish Kurds.<ref>{{cite web|title= Unwitting Zionists: The Jewish Community of Zakho in Iraqi Kurdistan p.48|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=2009|last=Gavish|first=Haya|url= http://wsupress.wayne.edu/books/937/Unwitting-Zionists|access-date=2009-09-06}}</ref>

Kurdish society was primarily a tribal one. The Jews of Zakho bore arms like Kurdish Muslims.<ref>{{cite web|title= Unwitting Zionists: The Jewish Community of Zakho in Iraqi Kurdistan p.28|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=2009|last=Gavish|first=Haya|url= http://wsupress.wayne.edu/books/937/Unwitting-Zionists|access-date=2009-09-06}}</ref> There was an attack on the Jews in 1891, when one of the synagogues was burnt down. The troubles intensified in 1892.

Most of the Jews relocated to Israel in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|title= Unwitting Zionists: The Jewish Community of Zakho in Iraqi Kurdistan |publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=2009|last=Gavish|first=Haya|url= http://wsupress.wayne.edu/books/937/Unwitting-Zionists|access-date=2009-09-06}}</ref> While the Jews of Zakho were among the least literate in the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]], they had a unique and rich oral tradition, known for its legends, epics and ballads, whose heroes came from both Jewish and Muslim traditions.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Changes in the oral tradition among the jews of kurdistan |publisher=Contemporary Jewry - Springer Netherlands|date=2008-10-09
