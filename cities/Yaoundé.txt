'''Yaoundé''' ({{IPAc-en|uk|j|ɑː|ˈ|ʊ|n|d|eɪ|,_|-|ˈ|uː|n|-}};<ref>{{citation|last=Jones|first=Daniel|author-link=Daniel Jones (phonetician)|title=English Pronouncing Dictionary |editor=Peter Roach |editor2=James Hartmann |editor3=Jane Setter|place=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|orig-year=1917|year=2003|isbn=3-12-539683-2}}</ref> {{IPAc-en|us|ˌ|j|ɑː|ʊ|n|ˈ|d|eɪ}}, {{IPA|fr|ja.unde}}) is the [[Capital city|capital]] of [[Cameroon]] and, with a population of more than 2.8 million, the second-largest city in the country after the port city [[Douala]]. It lies in the [[Centre Region (Cameroon)|Centre Region]] of the nation at an elevation of about 750 metres (2,500&nbsp;ft) above [[sea level]].

The outpost of '''Epsumb''' or '''Jeundo''' was founded between the [[Nyong River|Nyong]] and [[Sanaga River|Sanaga]] [[rivers of Cameroon|rivers]] at the northern edge of the area's forests in 1887 by German explorers as a trading base for rubber and ivory. A military garrison was built in 1895 which enabled further colonization. After Imperial Germany's defeat in [[World War I]], [[French Third Republic|France]] held [[French Cameroon|eastern Cameroon]] as a [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]], and Yaoundé was chosen to become the capital of the colony in 1922.<ref name=":0" />

[[Douala]] remained the more important settlement, but Yaoundé saw rapid growth and continued as the seat of government for the [[Republic of Cameroon]] upon its independence in 1960. Most of Yaoundé's economy is still centred on the administrative structure but major industries in Yaoundé include [[tobacco]], [[dairy]] products, beer, [[clay]], [[glass]] goods and [[timber]]. The city has many striking monuments and buildings, such as the Presidential Palace and Palais des Congrès.

==History==
{{For timeline}}
[[File:Lac Municipal de Yaoundé.jpg|thumb|Yaoundé Lake]]
The earliest inhabitants of Cameroon were likely the [[Baka people (Cameroon and Gabon)|Bakas (pygmies)]]. They still inhabit the forests of the south and east regions. Bantu speakers originating in the Cameroonian highlands were among the first groups to move out before other invaders. During the late 1770s and early 1800s, the [[Fula people|Fulani]]—a pastoral Islamic people of the western Sahel—conquered most of what is now northern Cameroon, subjugating or displacing its largely non-Muslim inhabitants.

The outpost of '''Epsumb''' or '''Jeundo''' was founded between the [[Nyong River|Nyong]] and [[Sanaga River|Sanaga]] [[rivers of Cameroon|rivers]] at the northern edge of the area's forests in 1887,<ref>Yaw Oheneba-Sakyi &&nbsp;al.

[[Hans Dominik (Schutztruppe)|Major Dominik]]'s establishment of a military garrison at the site in 1895 permitted a [[Pallottine mission to Kamerun|Pallotine mission]] and religious school at nearby [[Mvolyé]] (now a suburb).<ref name=mama/>

During [[World War I]], Jaunde was occupied by [[Belgian army|Belgian troops]] from the [[Belgian Congo|Congo]]. After Imperial Germany's defeat in that war, [[French Third Republic|France]] held [[French Cameroon|eastern Cameroon]] as a [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]] of the [[League of Nations]] and Yaoundé was chosen to become the capital of the colony in 1922.<ref name=":0">Britannica,

[[Douala]] long remained the more important settlement, but Yaoundé saw rapid growth after 1957 due to the cocoa crisis and unrest along the coast. It continued as the seat of government for the [[Republic of Cameroon]] upon its independence.

==Economy==
<!--[[File:YaoundePanoramicView.jpeg|center|upright=2.0|thumb|Yaoundé Panoramic view]]-->

Most of Yaoundé's economy is centred on the administrative structure of the civil service and the diplomatic services. Owing to these high-profile central structures, Yaounde has a higher [[standard of living]] and security than the rest of Cameroon.

Major industries in Yaoundé include [[tobacco]], [[dairy]] products, beer, [[clay]], [[glass]] goods and [[timber]]. It is also a regional distribution centre for [[coffee]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[copra]], [[sugar cane]] and [[rubber]].

Local residents engage in urban agriculture. The city is estimated to have "50,000 pigs and over a million chickens."<ref name=tamingwaters>{{cite web |title=Cameroon: Taming Waters for Health, Jobs in Yaounde |work=[[AllAfrica]] |access-date=January 8, 2015 |date=December 1, 2014 |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201412012479.html}}</ref>

In 2010, under Mayor Jean Claude Adjessa Melingui, Yaoundé began a flood reduction project, the Yaoundé City Sanitation Master Plan, to deal with "severe floods [that] disrupted the city 15 to 20 times a year, affecting as many as 100,000 people at a time." After four years, the frequency of flooding had been reduced from fifteen to three times a year, and cases of water-borne diseases such as [[typhoid]] and [[malaria]] were reduced by almost half. Although Melingui died in 2013, local officials are continuing his efforts to transform the city. Ongoing improvements to sanitation infrastructure are being carried out under a "$152 million plan, largely financed by loans, primarily from the [[African Development Bank]] and the [[French Development Agency]]", slated for completion in 2017.<ref name=tamingwaters/>

Despite the security issues and humanitarian crises that have plagued the central African nation, its economy remains stable. In fact, there is diversification of its productive economic activities, with the services sector contributing about half of the total domestic production.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://heritage.org/index/country/cameroon |title=2016 Index of Economic Freedom |website=Heritage |access-date=4 November 2016}}</ref> However, like many African countries, Cameroon has long suffered from corruption, which dominates almost all the sectors, particularly in the capital city. Oil, gas and mining revenues are rarely reported, which implies massive graft.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Corruption in Cameroon.|journal=Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, 1999.}}</ref> In addition, there is weak protection of real and intellectual property, and the judicial system is vulnerable to political manipulation.

According to Yaoundé City Council data, over 130 floods struck the city between 1980 and 2014, causing massive loss of life and economic damage. However, there has been a reduction of flooding in the city since the establishment of a sanitation master plan to address the issue.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://unisdr.org/archive/45366 |title=Cameroon's Cities Tackle Flood Risk |last=Nfor |first=Monde Kingsley |website=United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction |date=7 August 2015 |access-date=4 November 2016}}</ref> Another measure was to relocate people living along the drainage routes and in low-lying flood zones.

== Architecture ==
The city centre houses government offices, some hotels, and the central market. The Bastos district, with most homes owned by Cameroonians, is home to foreign embassies and the expatriate European, American and other continental communities (drawn mainly from the diplomatic corps). The presidential palace and compound are in the Etoudi district.

Also found in Yaoundé are:
* the [[Reunification Monument]]
* the [[Yaoundé Multipurpose Sports Complex|Sport Palace]] (''Palais des Sports'')
* Palais des Congrès

There is a small zoo in the [[Mvog-Betsi Zoo|Mvog-Betsi]] neighbourhood. Yaoundé has a small assortment of Pubs, nightclubs and restaurants.
A distance outside Yaoundé is the NGO [[Ape Action Africa]], which rescues and rehabilitates Great Apes threatened with extinction by the illegal bushmeat and deforestation trades.

== Places of worship ==
[[File:Yaoundé Cathédrale.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[Our Lady of Victories Cathedral, Yaoundé]]]]
The [[places of worship]] in the city are predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]] churches: [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Yaoundé]] ([[Catholic Church]]), Christian Missionary Fellowship International and Associated Churches (Pentecostal), [[Evangelical Church of Cameroon]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]), [[Presbyterian Church in Cameroon]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]), [[Union of Baptist Churches in Cameroon]] ([[Baptist World Alliance]]), Full Gospel Mission Cameroon ([[Assemblies of God]]).<ref>J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann, ‘‘Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices’’, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2010, p. 484-486</ref> There are also [[Islam|Muslim]] mosques.

==Climate==
Yaoundé features a [[Tropical savanna climate|tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Aw]]), and it is thermally equatorial rather than tropical, with a narrow range of monthly temperatures throughout the year. However, primarily due to the altitude, temperatures are not quite as hot as one would expect for a city located near the equator. Yaoundé features a lengthy [[wet season]], covering a ten-month span between March and November. However, there is a noticeable decrease in precipitation within the wet season, seen during the month of July, almost giving the city the appearance of having two separate rainy seasons; this is because the city is only slightly north of the equator. It is primarily due to the relative lull in precipitation during this month that Yaoundé features a tropical wet and dry climate, as opposed to a [[tropical monsoon climate]].

==Transport==
Two trans-African automobile routes pass through Yaoundé:
* [[Tripoli-Cape Town Highway]] [[File:Schild TAH3.svg|20px]]

* [[Lagos-Mombasa Highway]][[File:Schild TAH8.svg|20px]]

Many bus companies operate from the city; particularly in the Nsam and Mvan districts.<ref name="Bradt">{{cite book|title=Cameroon|isbn=978-1-84162-353-5|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|author=Ben West|year=2011|edition=3}}</ref>  Frequent buses run on the road between Yaoundé and Douala, which has witnessed several fatal accidents. Travel time by road between Douala and Yaounde is approximately 3 hours. Traffic in the city can be heavy during weekdays, but is very light during the weekends. Yaoundé has made significant progress in infrastructure, especially road construction.

[[Yaoundé Nsimalen International Airport]] is a major civilian hub, while nearby [[Yaoundé Airport]] is used by the military.

[[Railway line|Train line]]s run west to the port city of [[Douala]] and north to [[N'Gaoundéré]].

==Education==
Cameroon is a bilingual country, where English and French are both official languages; therefore in the city there is a coexistence of French educational system schools, where the degree giving access to university is the [[Baccalauréat|Baccalaureate]], and all the education is in French, and the English educational system schools, where the degree giving access to university is the [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] [[Advanced level]].

There are three American schools in Cameroon, the [[American School of Yaounde]] (ASOY) and Rain Forest International School (RFIS), and the [[American School of Douala]] (ASD). There is also one Turkish School, The Amity College/School.

Yaoundé is the site of several universities: the [[University of Yaoundé II]] (on a campus outside of town), the Protestant University of Central Africa (UPAC) and the [[Catholic University of Central Africa]] (UCAC). Several of the nation's professional schools are also located in Yaounde (Higher Teacher's training college, École Militaire InterArmes du Cameroun) as well as various schools for Engineers (Polytech), Doctors (CUSS), Nurses and Diplomats.

== Healthcare ==
The largest hospital is the [[Central Hospital of Yaoundé]] (''Hôpital Central de Yaoundé'') with 650 beds.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Central Hospital of Yaoundé |access-date=July 26, 2012 |title=Overview |url=http://www.hopitalcentral.org/nouveau/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=48&Itemid=58 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710140246/http://www.hopitalcentral.org/nouveau/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=48&Itemid=58 |archive-date=July 10, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Yaoundé General Hospital]] (''Hôpital Général de Yaoundé'' – HGY) had 302 beds when it was built in 1985.<ref name="Binder2001">{{cite book |last=Binder |first=Georges |title=Montois Partners: Selected and Current Works |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_5qvKs_Z1QgC&pg=PA126 |date=1 March 2001 |publisher=Images Publishing |isbn=978-1-86470-069-5 |page=126}}</ref> Other hospitals are the [[Yaoundé Gynaecology, Obstetrics and Pediatrics Hospital]] (''Hôpital Gynéco-Obstétrique et Pédiatrique de Yaoundé'' – HGOPY) and the [[University Hospital Center of Yaoundé]] (''Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Yaoundé'' – CHU).

==Sports==
[[File:Stade Ahmadou Ahidjo 2014 (4).jpg|thumb|[[Stade Ahmadou Ahidjo|Ahmadou Ahidjo stadium]] during a match]] 
The national [[football (soccer)|football]] team plays some of its home matches in the [[Stade Omnisports|Ahmadou Ahidjo]] stadium and the football clubs [[Canon Yaoundé]], [[Impôts FC]] and [[Tonnerre Yaoundé]] are all based in the city. The [[Grand Prix Chantal Biya]], a men's [[road bicycle racing]] event on the [[UCI Africa Tour]], starts and finishes in Yaoundé.

Yaoundé is also the base for the National Institute of Youth and Sport ([[:fr:Institut national de la jeunesse et des sports|INJS]]); this school trains government workers who will be in charge of sport all across the country during their career.

[[Joel Embiid]], center for the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], and [[Luc Mbah a Moute]], who was a forward for the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] are from Yaoundé, as are [[Samuel Umtiti]], a footballer for the [[France national football team|national team of France]] and [[FC Barcelona]], [[Breel Embolo]], a footballer for [[AS Monaco FC]] and [[Vincent Aboubakar]], a footballer for [[Porto]].
