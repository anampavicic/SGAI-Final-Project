'''Port Dickson''' ([[Negeri Sembilan Malay]]: ''Podeksen'', [[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]: {{lang|ms-arab|{{Script|Arab|ڤورت ديکسن}}}}), colloquially referred to as '''PD''' is a [[beach resort]] in [[Port Dickson District]], [[Negeri Sembilan]], Malaysia. It is the second largest urban area in Negeri Sembilan after [[Seremban]], its state capital. The town's administration is run by the '''Port Dickson Municipal Council''' ({{lang-ms|Majlis Perbandaran Port Dickson}}; MPPD), formerly known as the '''Port Dickson Sanitary Board''' ({{lang-ms|Lembaga Kesihatan Port Dickson}}) from 29 March 1928 until 28 February 1950, '''Port Dickson Town Board''' ({{lang-ms|Lembaga Bandaran Port Dickson}}) from 1 March 1950 until 30 November 1979, '''Port Dickson District Council''' ({{lang-ms|Majlis Daerah Port Dickson}}) from 1 December 1979 until 1 February 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pekhabar.com/h-i-d-s-pengisytiharan-majlis-perbandaran-port-dickson/|title=Pengisytiharan Majlis Perbandaran Port Dickson|date=1 February 2018|website=PeKhabar|accessdate=19 November 2022}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:KITLV - 79931 - Kleingrothe, C.J. - Medan - Railways at Port Dickson at Seremban - circa 1910.tif|250px|thumb|The western terminus of the Seremban-Port Dickson railway line. Downtown Port Dickson, 1910.]]

The town used to produce [[charcoal]] and therefore was called '''Arang''' (Malay: "charcoal") - there used to be a carbon mine at the first mile of the [[Malaysia Federal Route 5|coast road]] (hence named Jalan Pantai) - but it was later developed as a small port by the British during the Straits Settlement period. Port Dickson was also known as '''Tanjung''' (Malay: "[[cape (geography)|cape]]"), alluding to the town centre's location on a small [[peninsula]]. The oldest shophouses were the four situated presently at Jalan Lama.

Historically what is today Port Dickson and nearby [[Lukut]] were then part of the Luak of [[Kuala Langat District|Kelang]], one of the original nine chiefdoms (''luak'') that form the first iteration of [[Negeri Sembilan]] in 1773.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://kingsckt.com/keunikan-sejarah-pembentukan-negeri-sembilan-yang-ramai-tak-tahu/ | title=Jangan Berani Nak Mengaku Kau Anak Nogori, Kalau Sejarah Nismilan Pun Kau Tak Tahu.

On 30 July 1880, a meeting was held in [[Singapore]] between [[Abdul Samad of Selangor|Sultan Abdul Samad]] (then Sultan of Selangor), Raja Bot (the ruler of Lukut district), Dato' Kelana of [[Sungai Ujong]] as well as the British, in which Selangor cedes the district of Lukut to Sungai Ujong (which later became the modern day Negeri Sembilan).<ref>{{cite web|title=Lukut asalnya adalah kawasan Selangor|url=http://dun26bangi.blogspot.my/2013/11/lukut-asalnya-adalah-kawasan-selangor.html|website=DUN N26 Bangi, Selangor|date=16 November 2013|access-date=2015-10-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Perjanjian Sempadan Negeri Selangor dan Sungai Ujung 1880|url=https://wangsamahkota.wordpress.com/2010/06/13/kekuatan-diri/|website=Wangsa Mahkota Selangor|date=13 June 2010|access-date=2015-10-14}}</ref>

[[Tin ore]] was plentiful in [[Lukut]], an area within the Port Dickson district, during the 1820s, and it attracted Chinese immigrant miners. The British considered the area to have great potential as a harbour. It was intended to supersede the port in Pengkalan Kempas. The in-charge officer's name was Dickson, and thereafter the town was named Port Dickson. Others claim that [[John Frederick Dickson|Sir John Frederick Dickson]], colonial secretary,<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=The Knights of England: A Complete Record from the Earliest Time to the Present Day of the Knights of All the Orders of Chivalry in England, Scotland, and Ireland, and of Knights Bachelors.

Port Dickson evolved into a busy trading centre. Railways were constructed to facilitate the growth and development of Port Dickson. Although Port Dickson experienced rapid development, its beaches are fairly well preserved.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Since 1933, Port Dickson is also home to many army camps of the [[Malaysian Army]] such as the Army Basic Training Centre (PUSASDA), Sebatang Karah, Segenting, Si Rusa and Sunggala.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nst.com.my/streets/central/malaysia-s-own-fort-knox-1.95007?localLinksEnabled=false|title=Malaysia's own Fort Knox|date=2012-06-16|work=New Straits Times|access-date=2012-06-16}}</ref>

== Economy ==
[[File:Aerial of Negeri Sembilan 2023 11.jpg|250px|thumb|Aerial view of the southern suburbs of Port Dickson: Si Rusa, Sunggala and [[Teluk Kemang]]. The peninsula of [[Tanjung Tuan]] (an exclave of [[Malacca]]) can be seen at the distance.]]
A [[resort town]], Port Dickson thrives primarily on [[tourism]]. Nevertheless, there are other sectors that contribute to the town's economic growth. Along with Nilai and Seremban, Port Dickson is part of the [[Malaysia Vision Valley]], a growth corridor initiated by the Negeri Sembilan state government which aims to develop  the western half of Negeri Sembilan to complement the existing development in the neighbouring [[Klang Valley]] and the [[Greater Kuala Lumpur]] area as a whole.

Residential and commercial real estate transactions in Port Dickson have seen notable activity in recent months. 

===Oil and gas production===
[[File:Oil Refinery in Port Dickson (49753123742).jpg|left|thumb|An oil refinery in Port Dickson]]
Port Dickson has two refineries which make significant contributions to the local economy. [[Shell plc|Shell]] Refining Company has been operating since 1962<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shell.com/src/news-and-library/2013/shell-refinery-celebrates-50-years-with-the-community-20130205.html |title=Shell Refinery Celebrates 50 Years With The Community - Shell Refining Company |publisher=Shell.com |access-date=2013-11-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111073451/http://www.shell.com/src/news-and-library/2013/shell-refinery-celebrates-50-years-with-the-community-20130205.html |archive-date=2013-11-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> while [[Petron Corporation|Petron]] (formerly [[ExxonMobil]] Malaysia) operates another refinery which began operation in 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.petron.com.my/web/site/slider/20 |title=Petron Malaysia |publisher=Petron.com.my |access-date=2013-11-11}}</ref>

In 2016, Shell Refining Company underwent a transition of its major shareholder. Currently, the majority shareholder is Malaysia Hengyuan International Limited (MHIL) as at 22 December 2016 with an equity stake of 51.02 percent. Shell Refining Company is then changed to Hengyuan Refining Company.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hrc.com.my/about-hrc.html|title = HRC &#124; Fueling a Sustainable Future}}</ref>

===Tourism===
[[File:Lexis Hibiscus Port Dickson.jpg|thumb|Lexis Hibiscus Port Dickson, with [[Tanjung Tuan]] jutting out into the [[Strait of Malacca]] to its right]]
The {{cvt|18|km}} long beach from [[Tanjung Gemuk]] to [[Tanjung Tuan]] is a holiday destination for local visitors, especially those who come from the [[Klang Valley]]. Many Singaporeans have invested in holiday homes in and around Port Dickson. Over the years, many hotels and resorts were opened to capitalize on the tourist draw. In the 1990s, Port Dickson boomed with new hotels and resorts being planned and constructed. Due to the [[Asian financial crisis]] of 1997, however, many of these projects stalled, leaving many unfinished buildings scattered along the Port Dickson coastline. While some of these half constructed resorts are still abandoned, with the improving economy of the 2000s, many of the projects were eventually revived and completed.

====Lukut====
[[Lukut]] is the northeastern suburb of the Port Dickson town proper. Overall, it has residential, shop units, shopping mall, hotels and tourism attractions.  Some of the attractions in the area include Alive 3D Art Gallery and Wild West Cowboy Indoor Amusement park, 5D cinema, Awake Horror Thrills, Skunk Show, Children Amusement.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} In 2018, Tasik Villa International Resort,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Frontpage Template|url=http://tasikvilla.com.my/en_US/|access-date=2020-07-06|website=tasikvilla.com.my|df=dmy-all}}</ref> which includes a man-made lake, was launched.

====Sailing related====
Linking the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the [[Straits of Malacca]] is the shortest sea route between three of the world's most populous countries - India, China, and Indonesia. Inspired by the sea trade, ex-pats founded the Royal Port Dickson Yacht Club (RPDYC) in 1927, which still offers dinghy sailing courses and runs regattas. Unknown to most, Malaysia's developmental sailing teams, starting at the [[Optimist (dinghy)|Optimist]] Dinghy level, train in and sail from the RPDYC to the Port Dickson Polytechnic.

The newer five-star Admiral Marina & Leisure Club has good dock facilities for yacht travellers, sailboats and luxury cruisers. It is a transit point for racing sailboats joining the Raja Muda Selangor International Regatta, Royal [[Langkawi]] International Regatta and [[Thailand]]'s [[Phuket King's Cup Regatta|Phuket Kings Cup]] regattas. Admiral Marina also hosted the disabled sailing event of the [[2009 ASEAN ParaGames|2009 ASEAN Para Games]] and the [[2006 FESPIC Games]].<ref>{{Cite web

==Transportation==
[[Image:Portdickson01.jpg|thumb|259x259px|Map of Port Dickson|left]]
===Car===
Port Dickson is easily accessible from most major towns of peninsular Malaysia. The [[Seremban–Port Dickson Highway]] (operated by [[PLUS Expressways|PLUS]]) or the [[Malaysia Federal Route 53|Federal Route 53]] connects Port Dickson to [[Seremban]], the state capital.

[[Malaysia Federal Route 5|Federal Route 5]] runs through downtown Port Dickson and links it to [[Malacca]] and then [[Johor Bahru]] due south, or [[Kuala Langat]], [[Klang (city)|Klang]] or even [[Ipoh]] due north.

===Public transportation===
There was a 39&nbsp;km-long branch line of the [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu|KTMB]] network linking Port Dickson to {{kstn|Seremban}}, but operations were ceased in 2008. There were plans to reopen the line for freight and passenger services,<ref>{{cite web|title=Seremban-Port Dickson railway line to be rebuilt|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2015/09/14/serembanport-dickson-railway-line-to-be-rebuilt/|website=The Star Online|access-date=2016-01-24}}</ref> but the plan did not see any rebuilding as of 2020. Ultimately, KTMB decided to have the Port Dickson line undergo quiet dismantling works, and in phases starting from July 2022.
