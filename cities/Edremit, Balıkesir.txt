== History ==
{{Main|Adramyttium}}
The modern city of Edremit is named after the ancient city of [[Adramyttion]] ({{lang|grc|Ἀδραμύττιον}}) or Adramytteion (Ἀδραμύττειον), a city of [[Asia Minor]] on the coast of [[Aeolis]] which is in near city Modern [[Burhaniye]]

[[Alevism|Tahtacı Turkmen]], descendants of the army of Shah [[Ismail I]], settled in the mountains near Edremit after their defeat in the [[Battle of Chaldiran]] in 1514.{{sfnp|Ayliffe|2003|p=518}}

By 1819, [[Henry Alexander Scammell Dearborn]] recorded that Edremit was only populated by "a few Greek fishermen".{{sfnp|Dearborn|1819|pp=51–52}} In 1912, the town had 6200 inhabitants, 1200 of which were [[Greeks]].{{sfnp|Pétridès|1912|loc=coll. 595-596}} At this time, the district had 19 Greek schools and roughly 600 pupils.{{sfnp|Dieterich|1918|p= 45}}

In May 1914, thousands of Muslim refugees who had fled from the [[Balkans]] arrived in the town of Edremit and proceeded to ransack the shops and homes of the town's Greek community. According to [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], the Ottoman government armed and organised the refugees. Many Greeks found refuge in the town church before fleeing to the harbour where they were then granted passage to the neighbouring island of [[Lesbos]]. Turks continued to massacre or evict Greeks in the following months in surrounding villages.{{sfnp|Milton|2009|pp=48–50}}

Amidst the [[Greek Summer Offensive]] of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922]], Edremit was seized by the [[Army of Asia Minor]] on 19 June 1920 and a Turkish [[Turkish National Movement|Nationalist]] counterattack near the town was repelled.{{sfnmp|Kiminas|2009|1p=81|Erickson|2021|2p=63}} It remained under Greek control until their withdrawal in late August 1922, following which all remaining Greeks fled or were killed by the Turkish army.{{sfnp|Kiminas|2009|p=81}}
