'''Cuddalore''', also spelt as '''Kadalur'''{{refn|group=note|''Cuddalore'' is the [[British English]] spelling, and ''Kaḍalūr'' is the [[ISO 15919|romanized]] spelling from [[Tamil script]].}} ({{IPAc-en|audio=Cuddalore.ogg|k|ʌ|d|ə|ˈ|l|ɔər}}), is a heavy industries hub and a port city, and headquarters of the [[Cuddalore District]] in the [[India]]n state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. Situated south of [[Chennai]], Cuddalore was an important city and port during the [[British Raj]].

While the early history of Cuddalore remains unclear, the city first rose to prominence during the [[Pallavas]]' and [[Medieval Cholas|Medieval Cholas' reign]]. After the fall of the Cholas, the town was ruled by various dynasties like [[Pandyas]], [[Vijayanagar Empire]], [[Madurai Nayaks]], [[Thanjavur Nayaks]], [[Thanjavur Marathi people|Thanjavur Marathas]], [[Tipu Sultan]], French and the [[British Empire]]. Cuddalore was the scene of [[Seven Years' War|the Seven Years' War]] and the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1758)|Battle of Cuddalore]] in 1758 between the French and British. It has been a part of independent India since 1947. During the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], and the subsequent tsunamis generated, Cuddalore was one of the affected towns, with 572 casualties.

Apart from fishing and port-related industries, Cuddalore houses chemical, pharmacological and energy industries in [[SIPCOT]], an industrial estate set up by the [[Government of Tamil Nadu|state government]]. The city is administered by municipal corporation covering 101.6&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> . It had a population of 308,781 in 2011. Cuddalore is a part of the [[Cuddalore (State Assembly Constituency)|Cuddalore legislative assembly constituency]], a part of the [[Cuddalore (Lok Sabha constituency)|Cuddalore Lok Sabha constituency]]. There are 25 schools, two arts and science colleges and two engineering colleges in the city. There is one government hospital, six municipal maternity homes, and 42 other private hospitals that take care of the citizens' healthcare needs. Roadways are the primary means of transportation, while the town also has rail connectivity. The nearest airport is [[Chennai International Airport]], located 200&nbsp;km (120&nbsp;mi) away from the city, and another local airport is located in the district at [[Neyveli]] township is [[Neyveli Airport]]. The nearest seaport is Cuddalore Port where it handles small cargo ships, and the construction of port entry is underway. The closest major seaport is [[Karaikal port]], located 100&nbsp;km (62&nbsp;mi) away from the town.  Cuddalore is famous for educational institutions and medical establishments.

==Etymology==
Before the English took control, Cuddalore (anglicised) was called ''கூடலூர்'', ''Kūṭalūr'' meaning confluence in [[Tamil language|Tamil]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hunter |first1=William Wilson |title=The Imperial Gazetteer Of India Vol 4 |date=1885 |publisher=Trübner & Co. |location=London |page=45 |edition=2 |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.91347/page/n53/mode/2up}}</ref> It is situated on the backwater formed by the confluent estuaries of the rivers viz.,
[[Ponnaiyar River|Ponnaiyar]] (South Pennar river flowing through [[Karnataka]] and [[Tamil Nadu]]), [[Gadilam River|Kedilam]], [[Uppanar River|Uppanar]] and [[Paravanaru River|Paravanar]]. The Cuddalore district historically consisted of Chola Nadu and [[Nadu Naadu]]. The name ''Nadu Naadu'' meaning middle country may originate from its location between Chola Nadu and ''[[Tondaimandalam]]''; or between the Pallavas and the Cholas; or between central territories and the ocean.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cuddalore.nic.in/about-district/|title = About District &#124; Cuddalore District, Government of Tamilnadu &#124; Sugar bowl of Tamil Nadu &#124; India}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:SiegeOfCuddalore1783.jpg|200px|left|thumb|The [[siege of Cuddalore]] in 1783|alt=an art depicting a war between two horse troops]]
From ancient times the old town has been a seaport. For two centuries, Cuddalore was subject to several [[Imperialism|foreign powers]] including the [[Dutch Empire|Netherlands]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]], [[French colonial empire|France]], and the [[British Empire|British]]. Until 1758 Cuddalore was the capital to the South Indian territories which were under British control. Britain ruled a more significant part of South India (entire Tamil Nadu, parts of present Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka) from this fort (St. David).

In the early 17th century, the Dutch obtained permission from the ruler of Cuddalore to build a fort there, but political pressure from their Portuguese rivals forced them to abandon it.

Later, the French and English came to Cuddalore for trade and business. The French established a settlement {{convert|16|km|mi|0}} up the coast at [[Pondicherry district|Pondicherry]] in 1674, followed in 1690 by [[Fort St. David|Fort St. David's British colony]] at Cuddalore.

During the 18th century, various wars between the European powers spilt over to their colonial empires, and their allies, including those in the Indian subcontinent. During this period the French and British [[Battle of Cuddalore (disambiguation)|fought several times]] in the area.

In 1746, during [[First Carnatic War]], part of the [[War of the Austrian Succession|Austrian Succession War]], French forces [[Siege of Cuddalore (1746)|besieged the British]] at Fort St. David for several months before being driven off in 1747.

In 1758, during the [[Seven Years' War]], the French took the fort, and there was an inconclusive naval action, the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1758)|Battle of Cuddalore]], off the coast. The fort was later abandoned, in 1760, when the British attacked Pondicherry.

In 1782, during the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]], the French again took Cuddalore at the time of the [[American War of Independence]] and were [[Siege of Cuddalore|besieged there in 1783]] by the British. During the siege French and British naval forces again [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|clashed off the Cuddalore coast]]. The siege failed, but the fort was returned to the British in 1795. There were [[Pierre André de Suffren#Campaign against Sir Edward Hughes|five different naval actions off the coast]] during this period, all of which were indecisive.<ref>[[#Mohandoss|Jaques 2007]], p. 275</ref>

Some Cuddalore streets retain their British names, such as Clive Street, Wellington Street, Sloper Street, Canning Street, [[Rope Street]] (Rope Street, Wellington Street, Sloper Street and Canning Street jointly known as [[Salangukara Village]]), Lawrence Road and Imperial Road. The [[Cuddalore Central Prison]], opened in 1865, is a historically significant landmark. [[Subramania Bharati]] and other political leaders served prison terms there.

[[Tsunami]] waves that followed the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] near [[Sumatra]] hit India's eastern coast on 26 December 2004 at 8:32&nbsp;a.m. (IST), resulting in 572 casualties. Several fishing hamlets disappeared, while [[Silver Beach (India)|Silver Beach]] and the historically significant [[Cuddalore Port]] was devastated. [[Fort St. David]] survived without damage. On 30 December 2011, [[Cyclone Thane]] caused widespread damage to crops and buildings.

==Geography==
Cuddalore is located at &nbsp;11°45′N 79°45′E  /  11.75°N 79.75°E  / 11.75; 79.75. It has an average elevation of 6&nbsp;m (20&nbsp;ft). The land is completely flat with large black and alluvial soil inland and coarse sand near the seashore. The sandstone deposits in the town are popular. The Pennayar River runs north of the town, while Gadilam River runs across it. Cuddalore is situated at 200&nbsp;km (120&nbsp;mi) from the state capital [[Chennai]] and 18&nbsp;km (11&nbsp;mi) from [[Puducherry (union territory)|Puducherry]], the neighbouring union territory.<ref name="Airport information">{{cite web|title=Nearest airports|url=http://www.closestairportto.com/city/india/cuddalore/|publisher=closestairportto.com|access-date = 9 January 2016}}</ref>

== Geology ==
The Cuddalore Formation of the Cauvery Basin received siliciclastic detritus from inland areas of the Southern Granulite Terrain (SGT). It represented continental–fluvial sedimentation in the eastern continental margin of South India during the Miocene. Indian Summer Monsoon was thought to be initiated in the early Miocene and intensified during the middle Miocene causing major climatic shifts in the Indian subcontinent. In the present work, detailed mineralogical and geochemical studies on the siliciclastic Cuddalore Formation have been carried out to understand the provenance and paleoclimatic conditions during the Miocene. The paleocurrent direction, textural immaturity and framework detrital modes of sandstones suggest rapid uplift of basement and sediment source from nearby Madras Block of SGT. Various diagnostic immobile trace element ratios such as Th/Sc, Co/Th, La/Sc, La/Co suggest a tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite–charnockite provenance, and somewhat more felsic composition of source area compared to the present upper continental crust (UCC).<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jop.2021.11.006]</ref>

===Climate===

[[Northeast monsoon|North-East monsoon]] sets in October and continues till January. The rainfall during the South-West monsoon period is much lower than that of North-East monsoon. The average rainfall is 1,400&nbsp;mm (55&nbsp;in), most of which is contributed by the North-East monsoon.<ref name="about"/> The highest 24-hour rainfall recorded in Cuddalore was 570&nbsp;mm on 18 May 1943.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/11/28/stories/2008112854260400.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202174137/http://www.hindu.com/2008/11/28/stories/2008112854260400.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2 December 2008|location=Chennai, India|work=[[The Hindu]]|title=Rain-related death toll rises to 51|date=28 November 2008}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Indien Tamil Nadu Cuddalore Old Town Boats.jpg|210px|thumb|Fishing boats in Cuddalore]]
Being a coastal town, historically, Cuddalore's primary industry was [[fishing]]. Although Cuddalore was once a port town, the shipping trade has now moved to larger centres. Cuddalore also hosts the heavy chemical, pharmacological and energy industries in SIPCOT, an industrial estate set up by the state government. The National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) planned to commence power plants around the town.<ref name="urbaninfra12"/>

[[Fort St David]], situated on the River [[Gadilam River|Gadilam]] near Devanampattinam and acquired in 1653 CE by [[Elihu Yale]], a Christian slave-trader and cruel slave master, is one of the most visited tourist attraction in Cuddalore. The wealth embezzled and extracted by him was infused into [[Yale University]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}} Only two decades later, in 1677, when [[Shivaji]] captured [[Gingee]], the fort fell into the Marathas' hands. In 1690, the [[British East India Company]] purchased the fort and the adjacent villages (within "ye randome shott of a piece of ordnance".) A great gun was fired to different points of the compass. All the country within its range, including the town of Cuddalore, passed into English possession. The villages thus obtained are called "cannonball villages".<ref>{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Cuddalore|volume=7|pages=611–612}}</ref> The fortifications were strengthened in 1693, 1698, 1702, 1725, 1740 and 1745. In 1746 Fort St. David became the British headquarters for British India. The British ruled a more significant part of south India (Tamil Nadu, parts of the present- Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka) from Fort St. David. An attack by [[Joseph François Dupleix|Dupleix]] was successfully repulsed. In 1756, [[Robert Clive|Clive]] was appointed governor. The French captured the fort in 1758 but in 1760 relinquished it to Sir [[Eyre Coote (East India Company officer)|Eyre Coote]] of the British East India Company. The French recaptured the fort in 1782 and held it in 1783 during the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]]. In 1785 the fort passed into British possession. By this time, however, the centre of British rule was Fort St George.<ref>{{cite news|title=In search of a fort|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/in-search-of-a-fort/article3722254.ece|newspaper=The Hindu|date=3 August 2012|access-date=5 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=In search of a fort|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chen-columns/a-governor-kept-busy/article4863468.ece|newspaper=The Hindu|date=30 June 2013|last=S.|first=Muthiah|location=Chennai|access-date=5 January 2014}}</ref>
