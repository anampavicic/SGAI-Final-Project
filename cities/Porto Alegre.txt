Its population of 1.3 million inhabitants (2022) makes it the [[List of largest cities in Brazil|11th-most populous city in the country]] and the center of Brazil's [[List of metropolitan areas in Brazil|fifth-largest metropolitan area]], with 4.4 million inhabitants (2010). The city is the southernmost capital city of a Brazilian state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iguide.travel/Porto_Alegre/Introduction |title=Location of Porto Alegre |publisher=Iguide.travel |access-date=2010-10-21}}</ref>

Porto Alegre was founded in 1769 by Manuel Jorge Gomes de Sepúlveda, who used the pseudonym José Marcelino de Figueiredo to hide his identity; the official date, though, is 1772 with the act signed by [[Immigration to Brazil|immigrants]] from the [[Azores]], [[Portugal]].

The city lies on the eastern bank of the [[Guaíba Lake]], where five rivers converge to form the [[Lagoa dos Patos]], a giant freshwater [[lagoon]] navigable by even the largest of ships. This five-river junction has become an important alluvial port and a chief industrial and commercial center of Brazil.

In recent years, Porto Alegre hosted the [[World Social Forum]], an initiative of several nongovernment organizations. The city became famous for being the first city that implemented [[participatory budgeting]].<ref>{{cite web |title=More generous than you might think |author=Eva-Maria Verfürth |publisher=dandc.eu |date=February 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/participatory-budgeting-about-every-voice-being-heard |access-date=2013-05-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521035422/http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/participatory-budgeting-about-every-voice-being-heard |archive-date=2013-05-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> The 9th Assembly of the [[World Council of Churches]] was held in Porto Alegre in 2006. Since 2000, Porto Alegre also hosts one of the world's largest [[free software]] events, called [[FISL]]. The city was one of the host cities of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], having previously been a venue for the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]].

{{see also|Timeline of Porto Alegre}}
The official date of the foundation of the city of Porto Alegre is 26 March 1772, by Manuel Sepúlveda, when Freguesia de São Francisco do Porto dos Casais was created and changed a year later to Nossa Senhora da Madre de Deus de Porto Alegre. However, the village started in 1752, when 60 [[Azorean people|Azorean]] couples were brought over by the [[Treaty of Madrid (13 January 1750)|Treaty of Madrid]] to set up Missions at the Northeast Region of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] that was handed over to the Portuguese Crown in exchange for the [[Sacramento Colony]] located on the margin of the [[Plata River]]. Land demarcation took a long time and the Azoreans settled permanently at Porto de Viamão, which was the first name by which Porto Alegre went.<ref name="portoalegre.travel">{{cite web|url=http://www.portoalegre.travel/site/ing/info_servicos.php?idIndice=7&bitPesquisa=1|title=PortoAlegre.travel|website=Portoalegre.travel|access-date=12 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013064608/http://www.portoalegre.travel/site/ing/info_servicos.php?idIndice=7&bitPesquisa=1|archive-date=13 October 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

On 24 July 1773, Porto Alegre became the capital city of the province, when the administration of Manuel Sepúlveda, who used the fictitious name or pseudonym José Marcelino de Figueiredo, to hide his identity, officially started. In 1824, immigrants from all over the world started arriving, especially [[German colonization in Rio Grande do Sul|German]], [[Italian people|Italian]], [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Polish people|Polish]], [[Jewish]], and [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Alegre|first=Prefeitura Municipal de Porto|title=Turismo|url=http://www2.portoalegre.rs.gov.br/turismo/default.php?p_secao=257|access-date=2021-05-15|website=www2.portoalegre.rs.gov.br|language=pt-br|archive-date=2014-08-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140828021440/http://www2.portoalegre.rs.gov.br/turismo/default.php?p_secao=257|url-status=dead}}</ref>[[File:Correio_da_Manhã_AN_389.jpg|thumb|left|Porto Alegre in 1961]]

The capital city of Rio Grande do Sul is also the capital city in the [[Pampas]] region, the name given to the region of fauna and flora typical of the vast plains that dominate the landscape of the southern tip of Brazil, and parts of [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]], from where the ''[[gaúcho]]'' comes, the historical figure of a brave warrior who fought legendary battles and wars in the quest to conquer the borders of the kingdoms of Portugal and Spain in the 16th century.<ref name="portoalegre.travel"/>

Many wars occurred in the years before, but the 19th century marked its people, after they fought a long war for their independence from the [[Brazilian Empire]]. The [[Farrapos]] War started with the confrontation in Porto Alegre, near the [[Azenha Bridge|Azenha bridge]] on 20 September 1835. This conflict began the myth of the gaucho who is still praised in songs and celebrated in annual pageants and honored as names of streets and parks.<ref name="portoalegre.travel"/>

When the Farrapos War ended, the city continued to develop and underwent strong urban restructuring during the last decades of the 18th century, driven by the accelerated growth of port-related activities and shipyards. Its development continued over time and the city kept abreast with cultural, political and social events that were taking place within Brazil.

The city became known worldwide in 1963 through hosting the [[World University Games]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Spotlight: Porto Alegre 1963 Summer Universiade memories|url=https://www.fisu.net/news/summer-universiade/spotlight-porto-alegre-1963-summer-universiade-memories|access-date=2021-01-31|website=www.fisu.net|date=4 November 2019 |language=en-US}}</ref> In 1985, the people of Porto Alegre joined the movement for [[free elections]] and one of the largest demonstrations took place in the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sustainablecities.net/plusnetwork/plus-cities/porto-alegre-brazil |title=History of Porto Alegre |publisher=Sustainablecities.net |access-date=2010-10-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605214840/http://sustainablecities.net/plusnetwork/plus-cities/porto-alegre-brazil |archive-date=2010-06-05 }}</ref>

The city is on a [[River delta|delta]] resulting from the junction of five rivers, officially called [[Guaíba Lake]] (popularly mentioned as a river, too).

Before this,{{when|date=January 2021}} Porto Alegre was the port of [[Viamão]] on the shore of Guaíba Lake. Its previous name was Porto dos Casais (Port of the Couples). and it was initially settled by [[Azores|Azoreans]]. Many families of settlers came from the city of [[Rio Grande, Rio Grande do Sul|Rio Grande]] in the littoral Lagunar region, to the south, a military fortress at that time. Today [[Rio Grande, Rio Grande do Sul|Rio Grande]] is the most important port of the State of Rio Grande do Sul. The city is also known as "Porto do Sol" (Port of the Sun) and "Cidade Sorriso" (Smile City).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carnaval.com/brazil/portoalegre/#BU |title=Porto Alegre City&nbsp;– Names |publisher=Carnaval.com |access-date=2010-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922123741/http://www.carnaval.com/brazil/portoalegre/#BU |archive-date=2010-09-22 |url-status=live }}</ref> More than 70 [[neighborhood]]s (see below) are part of the city and two-thirds of the population are concentrated in the Zona Norte (Northern Zone), where most of the economic activity, including the city center, takes place.

Porto Alegre was the seat of the [[World Social Forum]] in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2010. As the second largest city in southern Brazil, it is an important industrial center in the area. It is also a center for ''[[gaucho|gaúcho]]'' (the popular name for natives of the state) history and culture, famous for its ''[[churrasco]]'' (barbecue) and ''[[chimarrão]]'' (a strong and hot tea prepared from [[yerba mate|erva mate]]).

==Geography==
[[File:Porto Alegre skyline.jpg|thumb|right|Historic Center of Porto Alegre]]
[[File:Porto Alegre - panoramio - Andervaz (1).jpg|thumb|Porto Alegre seen from Santa Tereza Hill]]
The city of Porto Alegre is located at the northern end of the large coastal lagoon, [[Lagoa dos Patos]] in southeastern Brazil. The city lies on the east bank of the mouth of the Rio Guaiba, the estuary of which forms the enormous freshwater lagoon, Lagoa dos Patos. Also joining the Guaíba at Porto Alegre are the [[Jacuí River]], the [[Sinos River]], the [[Gravataí River]] and the [[Caí River]], all tributaries of Guaíba just before it empties into Lagoa dos Patos.

Porto Alegre has a long coastline on the [[Guaíba Lake]], and its topography is punctuated by 40 hills. In the lake, a vast body of water, a maze of islands facing the city creates an archipelago where a unique [[ecosystem]] gives shelter to abundant wildlife. The city area concentrates 28% of the [[Atlantic Forest|native flora]] of Rio Grande do Sul, with 9,288 species.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Quadros |first1=Fernando Luiz Ferreira de |last2=Pillar |first2=Valério De Patta |title=Vegetation dynamics of natural grassland under treatments of burning and grazing |journal=Ciência Rural |date=October 2001 |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=863–868 |doi=10.1590/S0103-84782001000500020 |doi-access=free |hdl=10183/22423 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> Among these, there are many trees which are vestiges of the [[Atlantic Forest]]. Fauna are also diversified, especially in the islands and hills. The Portoalegrense environs include many parks, squares and wooded streets.

According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], Porto Alegre has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') characterized by its high variability, but with well-defined seasons and evenly distributed rain throughout the year. The presence of [[Lake Guaíba]] contributes to increase the humidity of the air.<ref>Penter, Camila et alii. "Inventário Rápido da Fauna de Mamíferos do Morro Santana, Porto Alegre, RS". In: Revista Brasileira de Biociências, Porto Alegre, v. 6, n. 1, jan./mar. 2008. p. 119</ref> The city experiences the most prominent difference among seasons and between temperature extremes among all Brazilian capitals. One reason for that is its much more southerly position relative to the rest of the country, which also contributes for the occurrence of 14 hours of daylight in December and 10 hours in June.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://astro.if.ufrgs.br/dia.htm|title=Duracao do Dia|website=astro.if.ufrgs.br|access-date=12 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022064942/http://astro.if.ufrgs.br/dia.htm|archive-date=22 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Due to a large depletion in the ozone layer over the south of Brazil, a result of the [[Antarctic ozone hole]],<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.5194/ANGEO-36-405-2018 | title=Report of a large depletion in the ozone layer over southern Brazil and Uruguay by using multi-instrumental data | year=2018 | last1=Bresciani | first1=C. | last2=Bittencourt | first2=Gabriela Dornelles | last3=Bageston | first3=J. | last4=Pinheiro | first4=D. | last5=Schuch | first5=N. | last6=Bencherif | first6=H. | last7=Leme | first7=N. | last8=Peres | first8=L. | journal=Annales Geophysicae | volume=36 | issue=2 | pages=405–413 | bibcode=2018AnGeo..36..405B | s2cid=55506074 | doi-access=free }}</ref> the population is occasionally dangerously exposed to extremely high [[UV radiation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zh.clicrbs.com.br/rs/noticia/2008/01/rs-e-o-estado-brasileiro-com-maior-incidencia-de-raios-ultravioleta-1730899.html|title=GaúchaZH - notícias, porto alegre, grêmio, inter, colunistas, jogos ao vivo e mais|website=Zh.clicrbs.com.br|access-date=12 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305072908/http://zh.clicrbs.com.br/rs/noticia/2008/01/rs-e-o-estado-brasileiro-com-maior-incidencia-de-raios-ultravioleta-1730899.html|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Porto Alegre lies in a transitional area between the [[subtropical]] forest and the Southern Brazilian grasslands (pampa). A number of conservation programmes have been established to protect [[Endemism|native]] trees. Many of the city's avenues have been planted with different tree [[species]]. One striking example of this is Teresópolis Avenue, where bottle trees have been planted. The city is covered in green vegetation and Lapacho and Jacaranda are the main species that can be found locally. The trees from the hills are protected. Two environmental conservation areas can be found in this city: "Delta do Jacuí" ([[Jacuí Delta]]) State Park and Lami Biological Reserve.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reservas.net/alojamiento_hoteles/portoalegre_brazil.htm |title=Vegetation in Porto Alegre |publisher=Reservas.net |access-date=2010-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130135211/http://reservas.net/alojamiento_hoteles/portoalegre_brazil.htm |archive-date=2010-11-30 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The urban area has many parks and plazas, making Porto Alegre one of the greenest provincial capitals in Brazil. The first city squares date from the second half of the 18th century and were originally large public spaces used as food markets. The city has {{convert|39|km2|acre|abbr=on}} of green space, occupying 31 percent of the city's area.{{citation needed|date=March 2023}} This is an average of 17.6&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> per person. More than one million trees line the public streets and SMAM plants an average of 30,000 seedlings each year. The four main parks are: Parque Farroupilha, a {{convert|37|ha|acre|adj=on}} park; Jardim Botânico (The [[Botanical Garden of Porto Alegre]]), with some 725 species of vegetation on about {{convert|43|ha|acre}} of land; and Parque Marinha do Brasil (The [[Brazilian Navy]]'s [[Park]]), a vast park of more than {{convert|70|ha|acre}} which offers a wide variety of sports fields and tracks. The city's [[cycleway]] is called the Caminho dos Parques, which at over {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=in}} long links the Moinhos do Vento, Farroupilha and Guaíba shore parks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sustainablecities.net/plusnetwork/plus-cities/porto-alegre-brazil |title=Green areas in Porto Alegre |publisher=Sustainablecities.net |access-date=2010-10-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605214840/http://sustainablecities.net/plusnetwork/plus-cities/porto-alegre-brazil|archive-date=2010-06-05 }}</ref>

The [[Lami José Lutzenberger Biological Reserve]] was established in 1975 in the Lami neighborhood of Porto Alegre, named after the local agronomist and environmentalist [[José Lutzenberger]].

===Water===

[[Sanitary sewer|Sewer]] service is available to 87.7 percent of the city, and 100 percent of the population is serviced by [[Water treatment|treated]] water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.portoalegre.rs.gov.br/dmae/default.php?p_secao=318|title=DMAE|first=Prefeitura Municipal de Porto|last=Alegre|website=2.portoalegre.rs.gov.br|access-date=12 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024055037/http://www2.portoalegre.rs.gov.br/dmae/default.php?p_secao=318|archive-date=24 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> While in most Brazilian cities the water is supplied by large state companies, in Porto Alegre the Municipal Department of Water and Sanitation Services, (DMAE) is the provider. It is the largest municipal water supplier in the country and enjoys operational autonomy and financial independence. As a separate entity from the municipal government it can make its own decisions on how to invest revenues it has collected, and such decisions are not directly subject to interference from the municipality. It receives no subsidies and makes no payments to the municipality itself. As a municipal undertaking, DMAE enjoys tax-exempt status, which allows it to keep water prices lower.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sustainablecities.net/plusnetwork/plus-cities/porto-alegre-brazil |title=Water system in Porto Alegre |publisher=Sustainablecities.net |access-date=2010-10-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605214840/http://sustainablecities.net/plusnetwork/plus-cities/porto-alegre-brazil |archive-date=2010-06-05 }}</ref>

In 2010, the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB) approved a US$83.2&nbsp;million to support the Integrated Socioenvironmental Program of Porto Alegre. The program will be carried out by the Municipal Department of Management and Strategic Support and will focus on improving [[water quality]] in Guaíba Lake and the Cavalhada River, developing urban infrastructure to reduce flood risk along the Cavalhada River, improving the environmental management in the Municipality of Porto Alegre, and promoting efficient municipal water, sanitation and storm drainage services. This program will improve the quality of life of the population of Porto Alegre by restoring water quality along the west side of Lake Guaíba and directly benefitting more than 700,000 residents through expanded public sanitation services and urban environmental improvement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zimbio.com/Water+Resources/articles/22/Improving+Environmental+Quality+Porto+Alegre |title=Integrated Socioenvironmental Program of Porto Alegre |publisher=Zimbio.com |access-date=2010-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712193216/http://www.zimbio.com/Water+Resources/articles/22/Improving+Environmental+Quality+Porto+Alegre |archive-date=2010-07-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Jacuí estuary contains the Jacuí Delta State Park, which in turn contains the [[Banhados do Delta Biological Reserve]], a fully protected area which covers the islands of Pólvora and Pombas.<ref>{{citation|language=pt|title=Parque e APA Estadual do Delta do Jacuí|publisher=Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul|url=http://www3.pucrs.br/pucrs/files/uni/poa/fau/pdf/mod_apres.pdf|access-date=2016-04-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530113333/http://www3.pucrs.br/pucrs/files/uni/poa/fau/pdf/mod_apres.pdf|archive-date=2016-05-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Air quality===
[[Motor vehicle]]s are responsible for the main atmospheric pollutant emissions. The city has the second worst air quality in Brazil, after only [[São Paulo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clicrbs.com.br/especiais/jsp/default.jsp?newsID=a2181723.htm&template=3847.dwt&section=Not%C3%ADcias&espid=21|title=Porto Alegre é a segunda capital do Brasil com mais poluentes no ar|website=Clicrbs.com.br|access-date=12 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013024912/http://www.clicrbs.com.br/especiais/jsp/default.jsp?newsID=a2181723.htm&template=3847.dwt&section=Not%C3%ADcias&espid=21|archive-date=13 October 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The use of new buses along dedicated busways has decreased pollutants as there is less idling time. SMAM (the Municipal Council of the Environment) has encouraged the use of the cleanest fuels and has played a role in monitoring pollution levels.

A partnership between SMAM, the [[Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul]], the State Environmental Protection Foundation (FEPAM) and [[Petrobrás]] has created a network of five air monitoring stations in Porto Alegre. By utilizing a Petrobrás product called city diesel, [[sulphur]] levels in the air have dropped from 1.2 percent in 1989 to 0.5 percent. [[Hybrid bus]]es which run on both diesel and electricity are also being considered for the future. Because Porto Alegre has a ready supply of [[natural gas]], the city's taxi fleet is gradually being converted to it from gasoline.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sustainablecities.net/plusnetwork/plus-cities/porto-alegre-brazil |title=Air quality in the city |publisher=Sustainablecities.net |access-date=2010-10-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605214840/http://sustainablecities.net/plusnetwork/plus-cities/porto-alegre-brazil |archive-date=2010-06-05 }}</ref>

Porto Alegre is mostly composed of Brazilians of European descent. Its [[colonization]] started in the mid-18th century, mostly with the arrival of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] colonists from the Azores Islands. From 1748 to 1756, 2,300 Azoreans were sent to the region by the King of Portugal to protect [[Southern Brazil]] from neighboring invaders.<ref>{{cite web |author=Francisco Oliveira |url=http://www.riogrande.com.br/historia/colonizacao3.htm |title=Portuguese and Azorian Portuguese in Rio Grande do Sul |publisher=Riogrande.com.br |date=2005-08-01 |access-date=2010-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523225655/http://www.riogrande.com.br/historia/colonizacao3.htm |archive-date=2011-05-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> These colonists, mostly composed of married couples, established the city of ''Porto dos Casais'' (literally translated "harbor of the couples"), nowadays Porto Alegre. In 1775, 55% of Rio Grande do Sul's population was of Azorean [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]] origin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atlasesportebrasil.org.br/textos/229.pdf |title=Azorean Portuguese origin in Porto Alegre |website=Atlasesportebrasil.org.br |access-date=2010-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030004653/http://www.atlasesportebrasil.org.br/textos/229.pdf |archive-date=2010-10-30 |url-status=live }}</ref> Porto Alegre was composed mainly of [[Portuguese people|Azoreans]] and their African [[slave]]s until the first half of the 19th century.

The first non-Portuguese people to settle Rio Grande do Sul were [[German Brazilian|German]] immigrants. In 1824, the first immigrants from Germany arrived in Porto Alegre, but they were sent to what is now the city of [[São Leopoldo]] ({{convert|28|km|0|abbr=on}} away). From 1824 to 1914, 50,000 Germans arrived in Rio Grande do Sul.<ref>{{cite web |author=Francisco Oliveira |url=http://www.riogrande.com.br/historia/colonizacao4c.htm |title=German colonies in the State of Rio Grande do Sul |publisher=Riogrande.com.br |date=2005-08-01 |access-date=2010-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523225843/http://www.riogrande.com.br/historia/colonizacao4c.htm |archive-date=2011-05-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Most of these colonists had rural communities in the countryside of the State as their first destination. The large [[rural exodus]] in Brazil in the early 20th century brought many German-descendants to Porto Alegre and, nowadays, they compose a large percentage of the population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brasilalemanha.com.br/informativo02.htm|title=A caminho dos 180 anos da imigração alemã (1824–2004)|date=12 June 2004|access-date=12 October 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040612173617/http://www.brasilalemanha.com.br/informativo02.htm|archive-date=12 June 2004}}</ref>

The second largest group of immigrants who arrived in Porto Alegre were the [[Italian Brazilian|Italians]]. They started immigrating to Brazil in 1875, mainly from the Northern Italian [[Veneto]] region.<ref>{{cite web |author=Francisco Oliveira |url=http://www.riogrande.com.br/historia/colonizacao5b.htm |title=Italian colonies in the State of Rio Grande do Sul |publisher=Riogrande.com.br |date=2005-08-01 |access-date=2010-10-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607120604/http://www.riogrande.com.br/historia/colonizacao5b.htm |archive-date=2008-06-07 }}</ref> As the Germans, Italians were also first sent to rural communities, mainly in the [[Serra Gaúcha]] region. After some decades, many of them started to migrate to other parts of Rio Grande do Sul, including Porto Alegre.

A feature of public administration in Porto Alegre is the adoption of a system of popular participation in the definition of public investment, called the Participatory Budget. The first full [[participatory budgeting]] process was developed in the city starting in 1989. Participatory budgeting in its most meaningful form took place in the city from 1991 to 2004.<ref name=autogenerated34>Baiocchi, Gianpaolo and Ernesto Ganuza. "Participatory budgeting as if emancipation mattered". In ''Politics and Society'', Vol. 42, No 1, 2014. pp. 29-50</ref> Participatory budgeting was part of a number of innovative reform programs to overcome severe inequality in living standards amongst city residents. One third of the city's residents lived in isolated slums at the city outskirts, lacking access to public amenities (water, sanitation, health care facilities, and schools).<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEMPOWERMENT/Resources/14657_Partic-Budg-Brazil-web.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-02-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211113204/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEMPOWERMENT/Resources/14657_Partic-Budg-Brazil-web.pdf |archive-date=2016-02-11 }}</ref>

Participatory budgeting in Porto Alegre has occurred annually, starting with a series of [[neighborhood]], regional, and citywide assemblies, where residents and elected budget delegates identify spending priorities and vote on which priorities to implement. Porto Alegre spent about 200&nbsp;million dollars per year on construction and [[service (economics)|service]]s,  This money is subject to participatory budgeting, unlike the annual spending on fixed expenses such as debt service and pensions, which is not subject to public participation. Around fifty thousand [[Residency (domicile)|resident]]s of Porto Alegre took part at the peak of the participatory budgeting process (compared to 1.5&nbsp;million city inhabitants), with the number of participants having grown year on year since 1989. Participants are from diverse economic and political backgrounds.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web |last=Lewit |first=David |url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/article.asp?ID=562 |title=Porto Alegre's Budget Of, By, and For the People by David Lewit |publisher=Yesmagazine.org |access-date=2010-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026142341/http://www.yesmagazine.org/article.asp?ID=562 |archive-date=2008-10-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.versobooks.com/books/169-deepening-democracy|title=Deepening Democracy: Institutional Innovations in Empowered Participatory Governance|date=March 2003|publisher=Verso Books|isbn=9781859844663|access-date=12 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013064825/https://www.versobooks.com/books/169-deepening-democracy|archive-date=13 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Although participatory budgeting appears to continue in the city today, two prominent scholars on the process have stated that "after the defeat of the Workers' Party in late 2004, a politically conservative coalition maintained the surface features of PB while returning the actual functioning of the administration to more traditional modes of favor-trading and the favoring of local elites."<ref name=autogenerated34/>

The participatory budgeting cycle starts in January and runs throughout the year in many assemblies in each of the city's 16 districts, dealing with many areas of interest to urban life. The meetings elect delegates to represent specific neighborhoods. The mayor and staff attend, in order to respond to citizens' concerns. In the following months, delegates meet to review technical project criteria and district needs.<ref name=autogenerated2/>
[[File:Largo dos açorianos 2.jpg|thumb|right|Administrative Center of Rio Grande do Sul]]

City department staff may participate according to their area of expertise. At a second regional plenary, regional delegates prioritize the district's demands and elect 42 [[councillors]] representing all districts and thematic areas to serve on the Municipal Council of the Budget. The main function of the [[Municipal Council]] of the Budget is to reconcile the demands of each district with available resources, and to propose and approve an overall municipal budget. The resulting budget is binding, though the [[city council]] can suggest, but not require,  changes. Only the Mayor may veto the budget, or remand it back to the Municipal Council of the Budget (this has never happened).<ref name=autogenerated2/>

A [[World Bank]] paper suggests that participatory budgeting has led to direct improvements in facilities in Porto Alegre. For example, [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] and water connections increased from 75% of households in 1988 to 98% in 1997. The number of schools quadrupled since 1986.<ref name=autogenerated1/> According to Fedozzi and Costa, this system has been recognized as a successful experience of interaction between people and the official administrative spheres in public administration and, as such, has gained a broad impact on the political scene nationally and internationally, being interpreted as a strategy for the establishment of an active citizenship in Brazil. The distribution of investment resources planning that follows a part of the statement of priorities for regional or thematic meetings, culminating with the approval of an investment plan that works and activities program broken down by investment sector, by region and around the city. Also according to Fedozzi, this favors:<ref>Fedozzi, Luciano. "Esfera pública e cidadania: a experiência do Orçamento Participativo de Porto Alegre". In: ''Ensaios FEE''. Porto Alegre, Vol. 19, No 2, 1998. pp. 237; 256</ref><ref>Costa, Giseli Paim. "Um Estudo sobre Cidadania e Políticas Públicas em Porto Alegre". In: ''Revista Brasileira de Gestão e Desenvolvimento Regional''. Vol. 3, n. 4 (número especial), nov/2007. p. 78</ref>

The high number of participants, after more than a decade, suggests that participatory budgeting encourages increasing [[citizen]] involvement, according to the paper. Also, Porto Alegre's health and education budget increased from 13% (1985) to almost 40% (1996), and the share of the participatory budget in the total budget increased from 17% (1992) to 21% (1999).<ref name=autogenerated1/>

Despite being the pioneering experiment of participatory budgeting, Porto Alegre like many other examples does not have guaranteed sustainability. The positive impact has dwindled since 2004 due to funding changes and decreasing government commitment. Participatory budgeting has been suspended in Porto Alegre since 2017 <ref>Abers, R., Brandão, I., King, R. & Votto, D. 2018.

The building, designed by Portuguese architect [[Álvaro Siza]] was opened in 2008 and offers views of the Guaiba river as well as downtown Porto Alegre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iberecamargo.org.br/site/default.aspx|title=Fundação Iberê Camargo|website=Iberecamargo.org.br|access-date=12 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013013503/http://www.iberecamargo.org.br/site/default.aspx|archive-date=2017-10-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>

'''Luiz Carlos Prestes' Memorial'''

Projected by [[Oscar Niemeyer]], the [[Luiz Carlos Prestes]]' Memorial is a recent addition to the city' cultural landscape. Besides the wall presentation of Prestes' life, a hall for cultural, social and political events is placed to the citizens of Porto Alegre.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://gauchazh.clicrbs.com.br/porto-alegre/noticia/2017/10/memorial-projetado-por-niemeyer-em-homenagem-a-prestes-e-inaugurado-em-porto-alegre-cj9cafoeq034n01o66xa5138b.html | title=Memorial projetado por Niemeyer em homenagem a Prestes é inaugurado em Porto Alegre | date=29 October 2017 | publisher=www.gauchazh.clicrbs.com.br | access-date=2018-01-17 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116135230/https://gauchazh.clicrbs.com.br/porto-alegre/noticia/2017/10/memorial-projetado-por-niemeyer-em-homenagem-a-prestes-e-inaugurado-em-porto-alegre-cj9cafoeq034n01o66xa5138b.html | archive-date=2018-01-16 | url-status=live }}</ref>

===Carnival/Carnaval===
{{Main|Brazilian Carnival}}
The Porto Alegre [[Carnival]] began in the 18th century with the entrudo, a prank brought over by the [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]] from the Azores, whereby people threw flour, water, and ''"limão de cheiro"'' missiles at each other. At the end of the 19th century, two important Carnival associations were born. Rivalry between the two long dominated the city's Carnival. The corso, a parade of floats down Porto Alegre's streets, was a celebration enjoyed by the more well-to-do of the city's inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museevirtuel.ca/Exhibitions/Festiva1/en/mpa/historia/entrudo.html |title=Carnival of Porto Alegre |publisher=Museevirtuel.ca |date=1999-04-19 |access-date=2010-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706190748/http://www.museevirtuel.ca/Exhibitions/Festiva1/en/mpa/historia/entrudo.html |archive-date=2011-07-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

One of the most important Carnival [[personalities]] is [[King]] Momo. At the beginning of Carnival, usually in February, he receives the keys to the city from the [[Mayor]] of Porto Alegre, symbolically governing the Carnival during the four days of revelry. Vincente Rao was the most popular King Momo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Festiva1/en/mpa/historia/momo.html |title=King Momo&nbsp;– Carnival, Porto Alegre |publisher=Virtualmuseum.ca |date=1999-04-19 |access-date=2010-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706212427/http://virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Festiva1/en/mpa/historia/momo.html |archive-date=2011-07-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Classic Music===
[[File:11.10.2022 - Apresentação da Orquestra Sinfônica de POA (OSPA) - Foto Michel Corvello (52423524258).jpg|thumb|Porto Alegre Symphony Orchestra]]
The city is a reference for the entire state in terms of classical music, serving as the main hub for production and dissemination of influence. It has a considerable audience for this genre; it is included in the tour routes of internationally renowned performers and boasts two major orchestras - the [[Porto Alegre Symphony Orchestra |Porto Alegre Symphony Orchestra (OSPA)]] and the PUCRS Philharmonic Orchestra - as well as a chamber orchestra, the São Pedro Theater Chamber Orchestra, along with numerous smaller chamber groups and vocal and instrumental soloists. The city also has a large number of music schools and performance venues.

At the same time, there is noticeable development in academic research and advanced professional qualification in the undergraduate and graduate music programs at [[Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul|UFRGS]]. In addition to generating a significant collection of musicological texts and publications and preparing a large number of music professionals and new teachers, the organization of high-quality public recitals is an integral part of the functioning of these programs.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Brazilian cuisine}}
The traditional beverage is [[Mate (drink)|chimarrao]], a South-American caffeine-rich infused drink. The Chalet of the XV de Novembro Plaza is located along the Glênio Peres Square, it is one of the most traditional bar-draught beer-[[restaurant]]s in the city, where the last "''lambe-lambe''" photographs of the region work. "Lambe-lambes" are photographers who develop pictures outdoor using the oldest method known. In the [[Bavaria]]n style, with art nouveau traits, the centenary Chalet was built up on a demountable steel structure, keeping its original chandeliers and tiles even nowadays.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carnaval.com/brazil/portoalegre/#BU |title=Drink in Porto Alegre |publisher=Carnaval.com |access-date=2010-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922123741/http://www.carnaval.com/brazil/portoalegre/#BU |archive-date=2010-09-22 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fodors.com/world/south-america/brazil/the-south/restaurants.html |title=Cuisine in Porto Alegre |publisher=Fodors.com |date=2010-10-01 |access-date=2010-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604001718/http://www.fodors.com/world/south-america/brazil/the-south/restaurants.html |archive-date=2011-06-04 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Architecture ==
{{Main|Architecture of Porto Alegre}}
The architecture of Porto Alegre is a mosaic of ancient and modern styles. This characteristic is most visible in the center of the city, the [[Centro Histórico, Porto Alegre|historic urban center]], where examples of eighteenth-century [[architecture]] survive amidst nineteenth-century and contemporary buildings.
[[File:Porto_Alegre_por_Cristine_Huff_15.jpg|thumb|Historic center skyline as seen from Guaíba River]]
[[File:Porto Alegre, RS - panoramio (16).jpg|thumb|Borges de Medeiros avenue]]
The architectural evolution of Porto Alegre does not differ in its general mechanism from most large Brazilian cities, although it has some unique elements. Its condition of provincial capital almost from the beginning resulted in a tendency to expand and monumentalize. Today it is the largest city in the state, the seat of a [[Greater Porto Alegre|Metropolitan Region]], and one of the largest cities in Brazil. Throughout its [[History of Porto Alegre|history]], it has collected an extensive series of monumental buildings, many of extraordinary value, and some advanced [[urban planning]] projects, but as a whole, this did not result in a coherent plan nor did it reveal a spirit of long-term planning, having grown vastly in a disorganized and poorly controlled way, with urban plans being very much linked to political and economic oscillations.

The architecture in the city began with the [[Portuguese culture|Portuguese colonial style]], went through the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]], [[Eclecticism in architecture|eclectic]], and [[Modern architecture|modernist]] schools. Porto Alegre verticalized, expanded, merged with neighboring cities, and became a [[metropolis]]. Now its architecture is being renewed under the influence of [[postmodernism]] and [[globalization]], developing a hybrid and internationalizing style. This has given rise to criticism about the de-characterization of its identity and the extensive destruction of irreplaceable historical architecture in the wave of "progress" and real estate speculation.

Today, the city is reorganizing its urban landscape with major infrastructure works, especially roads, and erecting significant examples of [[contemporary architecture]]. At the same time, it faces the challenges of growing into one of Brazil's largest capitals, with almost 1.5 million inhabitants. There is still a large population living in [[slum]]s and without access to basic services, and dissatisfaction is growing with the directions that the public administration has adopted in the areas of [[urban planning]], popular housing, use of special areas, urban mobility, nature preservation, and others. Urban revitalization projects promoted by the state and municipal governments, such as those of the [[Mauá Pier]], the former Industrial District, and a program of concessions of parks and other public spaces to the private sector, have produced intense controversy.

==Events==

===Port===
{{Main|Port of Porto Alegre}}
The Port of Porto Alegre is situated in the Eastern margin of Guaíba Lake. The port lying on the eastern bank of the Guaíba lake at the point where its waters empty into the huge Lagoa dos Patos is one of Brazil's largest ports. Located near the main access roads to Porto Alegre, it is {{convert|4|km|0|abbr=on}} away from the [[Salgado Filho International Airport]] and has access to the light railway [[Metro station|station]], through the docks of Mauá and Navegantes. Its geographical position enables a permanent traffic between Porto Alegre and [[Buenos Aires]], transporting steel-industry products and mainly agricultural produce.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sph.rs.gov.br/sph_2006/content/porto_poa/porto_poa_apresentacao.php|title=Redirecionando...|website=Sph.rs.gov.br|access-date=12 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430165758/http://www.sph.rs.gov.br/sph_2006/content/porto_poa/porto_poa_apresentacao.php|archive-date=30 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carnaval.com/brazil/portoalegre/#BU |title=Port of Porto Alegre |publisher=Carnaval.com |access-date=2010-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922123741/http://www.carnaval.com/brazil/portoalegre/#BU |archive-date=2010-09-22 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Metro===
[[File:0000 Porto Alegre Trensurb.JPG|thumb|left|The Mercado station is one of the main subway stations in Porto Alegre and is located in front of the city's public market.]]
{{Main|Porto Alegre Metro}}
Porto Alegre has a rapid transit system operated by [[Trensurb]], which links downtown Porto Alegre to its northern neighborhoods and to cities to the north of the [[metropolitan area]], as [[Canoas]], Esteio, [[Sapucaia do Sul]], São Leopoldo and [[Novo Hamburgo]]. The line has stations at strategic spots, such as: the Public Market, the bus station, the airport and many other important and urban spots throughout Porto Alegre and the other cities the metro covers. The line is built at surface level (30&nbsp;km, totally segregated) and elevated (12&nbsp;km).

Trensurb is operated jointly by the federal government, the state government of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and the city of Porto Alegre through the company Trensurb S.A. (Company of Urban Trains of Porto Alegre S.A.) and has 22 working [[Metro station|station]]s, with a total extension of nearly {{convert|43|km|mi}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trensurb.com.br/paginas/paginas_detalhe.php?codigo_sitemap=37|title=Distâncias entre as Estações - Trensurb - Empresa de Trens Urbanos de Porto Alegre S.A.|website=Trensurb.com.br|access-date=12 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116041303/http://www.trensurb.com.br/paginas/paginas_detalhe.php?codigo_sitemap=37|archive-date=16 November 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> carrying about 130,000 users a day. 
Building of the (sole) Line 1 of the metro started in 1980. The choice of path was made to relieve the heavy traffic of highway BR-116, which already presented serious problems with the transit at the time. The line was inaugurated on March 2, 1985, between the Central [[Public Market]] and Sapucaia do Sul. In December 1997, it was extended to Unisinos. An extension of {{convert|2.4|mi|km}} [[São Leopoldo]]–[[Museum]] was added in November 2000, after two months of trial service.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clicrbs.com.br/zerohora/jsp/default.jsp?uf=1&local=1&section=Geral&newsID=a1642209.xml |title=Metro (Porto Alegre) |publisher=Clicrbs.com.br |access-date=2010-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523235224/http://www.clicrbs.com.br/zerohora/jsp/default.jsp?uf=1&local=1&section=Geral&newsID=a1642209.xml |archive-date=2011-05-23 |url-status=live }}</ref> {{As of|2013}}, an extension to [[Novo Hamburgo]] is being completed, with the first station already fully functional.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trensurb.com.br/paginas/galeria_projetos_detalhes.php?codigo_sitemap=84|title=Expansão Novo Hamburgo - Trensurb - Empresa de Trens Urbanos de Porto Alegre S.A.|website=Trensurb.com.br|access-date=12 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203210214/http://www.trensurb.com.br/paginas/galeria_projetos_detalhes.php?codigo_sitemap=84|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

A metro system inside Porto Alegre only is currently planned and it is already subject of much publicity and speculation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.portoalegre.rs.gov.br/poametro/internas/Projeto/projeto.html|title=Metrô de Porto Alegre|website=.portoalegre.rs.gov.br|access-date=12 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109152159/http://www2.portoalegre.rs.gov.br/poametro/internas/Projeto/projeto.html|archive-date=9 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> However, no project has been approved so far and the beginning of the constructions is yet undefined.

===Highways===
There are two federal [[highway]]s in the city, BR-290 and BR-116, both running close to its northern and northwestern border. The small number is due to the inexistence of many destinations southeast or south of Porto Alegre (considering the landmass east of Lagoa dos Patos),<ref>Villaça, Flávio. ''Espaço intra-urbano no Brasil''. Studio Nobel, 1998, pp. 103-105</ref> if not for the cities of [[Pelotas]] (the third-biggest in population in the State) and Rio Grande (which hosts the State biggest [[port]]). Nonetheless, when coming from west, both highways bond in the neighbor municipality of Eldorado do Sul, running mostly jointly within the borders of Porto Alegre, only coming to separate at the very [[Interchange (road)|interchange]] to [[Canoas]]. This way, BR-116 has virtually no sole run within Porto Alegre.

BR-290 highway runs east–west across the state, linking the northeast coast of the state to the [[Uruguay]]–[[Argentina]]–Brazil border. It runs close to the northern border of the municipality. Coming from west, as it reaches the urban area of Porto Alegre, BR-290 highway becomes a high-standard {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} long [[freeway]] that connects to the coast and to the BR-101 highway. The latter is an important way to get to Porto Alegre from the north of the country, by the city Osório. BR-101 connects to [[Curitiba]], [[Florianópolis]] and northern Santa Catarina state, and has been recently upgraded to highway standards, with multiple lanes. By entering the BR-290 freeway/BR-101 system, and the other highways it connects to, it is possible to drive from Porto Alegre to as far as [[Rio de Janeiro]] or [[Belo Horizonte]] almost entirely through 4-lane (or more) highways.

The other road, BR-116, is a longitudinal highway, running northeast–south across the state, linking Porto Alegre to several satellite cities and other Brazilian capitals to the north, and [[Pelotas]] and [[Uruguay]] to the south. Within the municipality, it only touches the northwest side of the city, close to the end of Rio Gravataí (Gravataí [[River]]), sharing its entire run with BR-290, only separating when heading north onto [[Canoas]].

A third road, BR-448, is currently under construction.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.br448rodoviadoparque.com.br/ |title=BR448 Rodovia do Parque |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140107214110/http://www.br448rodoviadoparque.com.br/ |archive-date=7 January 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> BR-448 is planned to connect the northeast of Porto Alegre to [[Sapucaia do Sul]], as an alternative to BR-116, notably jam-packed on its [[Canoas]]-[[Novo Hamburgo]] stretch during traffic rush hours.

The connection between downtown Porto Alegre and the highways is made by Avenida Presidente Castelo Branco (President Castelo Branco Avenue), which is a short - {{convert|4|km|mi}} - avenue also bordering the northwest side of the city, Avenida dos Estados (States' Avenue), which is the access way to the [[Salgado Filho International Airport]], and Avenida Assis Brasil (Assis Brasil Avenue), the main Avenue in the northern Porto Alegre.

===Bus===

[[File:Carris 0866.jpg|thumb|A bus of CARRIS (Porto Alegre bus service)]]
The city has a functioning transportation system, especially the [[autobus]]es. Porto Alegre has also mini-buses from and to all the main [[neighborhood]]s in the city, with sitting-only transport and the possibility to hop on and off at any point but also higher fares. ''Linha Turística'' (Tourist Line) is a bus that leaves from Usina do Gasômetro tourist terminal around six times per day. During 90&nbsp;minutes, it traverses the various districts of Porto Alegre, for a modest price.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/South_America/Brazil/Estado_do_Rio_Grande_do_Sul/Porto_Alegre-1506259/Transportation-Porto_Alegre-BR-1.html |title=Bus in Porto Alegre |publisher=Virtualtourist.com |access-date=2010-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211135301/http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/South_America/Brazil/Estado_do_Rio_Grande_do_Sul/Porto_Alegre-1506259/Transportation-Porto_Alegre-BR-1.html |archive-date=2009-02-11 |url-status=live }}</ref> Exclusive [[bus]] [[lane]]s in the median of seven radial [[wikt:corridor|corridors]] that converge on the city center are used by both urban and [[regional]] lines.

About 325&nbsp;million people use the system annually.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sustainablecities.net/plusnetwork/plus-cities/porto-alegre-brazil |title=Bus System in the city |publisher=Sustainablecities.net |access-date=2010-10-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605214840/http://sustainablecities.net/plusnetwork/plus-cities/porto-alegre-brazil |archive-date=2010-06-05 }}</ref>

Those lines have no [[prefix]]. It is quite common to switch buses at downtown but since there is a myriad of lines there, it can be challenging to find the right terminal for the next bus. Transversal lines prefix "T" (T1, T2, ..., T11), connect different [[neighborhoods]] without going through the downtown area, which effectively eliminates the need of changing buses for the most common trips. [[wiktionary:circular|Circular]] lines prefix "C" (C1, C2, C3), as the name indicates, run in a circular manner, usually connecting parts of the downtown area to the nearest neighborhoods.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iguide.travel/Porto_Alegre/Getting_Around/Buses |title=Bus destines of the city |publisher=Iguide.travel |access-date=2010-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616132503/http://iguide.travel/Porto_Alegre/Getting_Around/Buses |archive-date=2011-06-16 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Mayor José Fogaça renewed his agreement with EMBARQ and the Center for Sustainable Transport Brazil (CTS-Brasil) to improve [[accessibility]] and mobility in downtown Porto Alegre.
