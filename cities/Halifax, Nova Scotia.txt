The first permanent European settlement in the region was on the [[Halifax Peninsula]]. The establishment of the ''Town of Halifax'', named after the [[George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax|2nd Earl of Halifax]], in 1749 led to the colonial capital being transferred from [[Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia|Annapolis Royal]].

The establishment of Halifax marked the beginning of [[Father Le Loutre's War]]. The war began when [[Edward Cornwallis]] arrived to establish Halifax with 13 transports and a sloop of war on June 21, 1749.<ref>Grenier, John. ''The Far Reaches of Empire. War in Nova Scotia, 1710-1760''. Norman: U of Oklahoma Press, 2008; Thomas Beamish Akins. ''History of Halifax''. Brookhouse Press, 1895.

To guard against Mi'kmaq, [[Acadians|Acadian]] and French attacks on the new Protestant settlements, British fortifications were erected in Halifax [[Citadel Hill (Fort George)|(Citadel Hill)]] (1749), Bedford ([[Fort Sackville (Nova Scotia)|Fort Sackville]]) (1749), Dartmouth (1750), and [[Lawrencetown, Halifax County, Nova Scotia|Lawrencetown]] (1754), all areas within the modern-day Regional Municipality. [[St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia|St. Margaret's Bay]] was first settled by French-speaking [[Foreign Protestants]] at [[French Village, Nova Scotia]] who migrated from [[Lunenburg, Nova Scotia]] during the American Revolution.

December 6, 1917 saw one of the great disasters in Canadian history, when the {{SS|Mont-Blanc}}, a French cargo ship carrying munitions, collided with the [[Commission for Relief in Belgium|Belgian Relief]] vessel {{SS|Imo}} in "The Narrows" between upper Halifax Harbour and Bedford Basin. The resulting explosion, the [[Halifax Explosion]], devastated the [[Richmond, Nova Scotia|Richmond District]] in the North End of Halifax, killing approximately 2,000 people and injuring nearly 9,000 others.<ref name=cbc>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/halifaxexplosion/he2_ruins/he2_ruins_explosion.html |title=CBC - Halifax Explosion 1917 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=September 19, 2003 |access-date=February 25, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203133603/http://www.cbc.ca/halifaxexplosion/he2_ruins/he2_ruins_explosion.html |archive-date=February 3, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The blast was the [[List of the largest artificial non-nuclear explosions#Rank order of largest conventional explosions#detonations by magnitude|largest artificial explosion]] before the development of nuclear weapons.<ref name=TimeDisaster>{{cite book|title=Time: Disasters that Shook the World|publisher=Time Home Entertainment|location=New York City|year=2012|page=56|isbn=978-1-60320-247-3}}</ref> Significant aid came from [[Boston]], strengthening the [[Boston–Halifax relations|bond between the two coastal cities]].

The four municipalities in the Halifax urban area had been coordinating delivery of some services through the Metropolitan Authority since the late 1970s, but remained independent towns and cities until April 1, 1996, when the provincial government [[amalgamation (politics)|amalgamated]] all municipal governments within [[Halifax County, Nova Scotia|Halifax County]] to create the Halifax Regional Municipality. The municipal boundary thus now includes all of [[Halifax County, Nova Scotia|Halifax County]] except for several First Nation reserves.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://novascotia.ca/dma/government/history.asp |title=Municipal History Highlights |publisher=Novascotia.ca |date=June 26, 2014 |access-date=July 13, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529085028/http://novascotia.ca/dma/government/history.asp |archive-date=May 29, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Since amalgamation, the region has officially been known as the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM), although "Halifax" has remained in common usage for brevity. On April 15, 2014, regional council approved the implementation of a new branding campaign for the municipality. The campaign would see the region referred to in promotional materials simply as "Halifax", although "Halifax Regional Municipality" would remain the region's official name.<ref name="ctv-newbrand">{{cite web|title=Goodbye HRM, hello Halifax: Mixed reaction to bold, new brand|url=http://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/goodbye-hrm-hello-halifax-mixed-reaction-to-bold-new-brand-1.1779311|work=CTV News Atlantic|date=April 16, 2014|access-date=April 24, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423042326/http://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/goodbye-hrm-hello-halifax-mixed-reaction-to-bold-new-brand-1.1779311|archive-date=April 23, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="hrm-boldnewbrand">{{cite web|title=Council Approves Bold New Brand Strategy for Halifax Region|url=http://www.halifax.ca/mediaroom/pressrelease/pr2014/NewsRelease-CouncilApprovesBoldNewBrandStrategyVisualIdentityforHalifax.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140419224811/http://www.halifax.ca/mediaroom/pressrelease/pr2014/NewsRelease-CouncilApprovesBoldNewBrandStrategyVisualIdentityforHalifax.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 19, 2014|publisher=Halifax Regional Municipality|access-date=April 24, 2014}}</ref><ref name="ch-newlogo">{{cite web|title=Halifax mayor, council approve city's new brand|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/metro/1200762-halifax-mayor-council-approve-city-s-new-brand|work=The Chronicle-Herald|date=April 15, 2014|access-date=April 24, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425184428/http://thechronicleherald.ca/metro/1200762-halifax-mayor-council-approve-city-s-new-brand|archive-date=April 25, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Geography==

===Climate===
Halifax has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb''), with warm summers and relatively mild winters, which is due to [[Gulf Stream]] moderation. The [[weather]] is usually milder in the winter or cooler in the summer than areas at similar latitudes inland, with the temperature remaining (with occasional notable exceptions) between about {{convert|-8|and|28|C}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian Climate Normals 1981-2010 Station Data| date=October 31, 2011 |url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=6357&lang=e&StationName=halifax&SearchType=Contains&stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=|publisher=Environment Canada|access-date=May 31, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107231005/http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=6357&lang=e&StationName=halifax&SearchType=Contains&stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=|archive-date=January 7, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> January is the coldest month, being the only month with a high that is slightly below freezing at {{convert|-0.1|C}}, while August is the warmest. The sea heavily influences the climate of the area, causing significant [[seasonal lag]] in summer, with August being significantly warmer than June and with September being the third mildest month in terms of mean temperature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=6357&lang=e&amp;StationName=Halifax+Citadel&amp;SearchType=Contains&amp;stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=4&dispBack=1|title=Climate Normals for Halifax Citadel 1981-2010|date=September 25, 2013 |publisher=Environment Canada|access-date=November 7, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020142553/http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=6357&lang=e&StationName=Halifax+Citadel&SearchType=Contains&stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=4&dispBack=1|archive-date=October 20, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Precipitation is high year-round. Winter features a mix of rain, freezing rain and snow with frequent freeze-thaw cycles. Snowfall is heavy in winter, but snow cover is usually patchy owing to the frequent freeze-thaw cycles, which melt accumulated snow. Some winters feature colder temperatures and fewer freeze-thaw cycles; the most recent of which being the winter of 2014–2015, which was the coldest, snowiest and stormiest in about a century. Spring is often wet and cool and arrives much later than in areas of Canada at similar latitudes, due to cooler sea temperatures. Summers are mild and pleasant, with hot and humid conditions very infrequent. Warm, pleasant conditions often extend well into September, sometimes into mid-October. Average monthly precipitation is highest from November to February due to intense late-fall to winter storms migrating from the Northeastern U.S., and lowest in summer, with August being the year's warmest and driest month on average. Halifax can sometimes receive hurricanes, mostly between August and October. An example is when [[Hurricane Juan]], a [[Category 2 hurricane|category 2]] storm, hit in September 2003 and caused considerable damage to the region. [[Hurricane Earl (2010)|Hurricane Earl]] grazed the coast as a [[Category 1 hurricane|category 1]] storm in 2010. In 2019, [[Hurricane Dorian]] made landfall just south of Halifax as a post-tropical storm with an intensity equivalent to a category 2 hurricane and caused significant damage across Nova Scotia.

===Metropolitan landscape===
As of the [[2021 Canadian Census]], the [[Census geographic units of Canada|Halifax Census Metropolitan Area]] (''Metropolitan Halifax'') is coterminous with the Municipality of Halifax and the [[Municipality of the District of East Hants|Municipality of East Hants]]. The total land area of Metropolitan Halifax is {{convert|727,622|ha|km2 mi2|abbr=off}}<ref name="auto">{{cite web |title=Census Profile, 2021 Census of Population Profile table |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&SearchText=Halifax&DGUIDlist=2021S0503205&GENDERlist=1,2,3&STATISTIClist=1&HEADERlist=0 |website=Statistics Canada |access-date=21 December 2022 |date=6 December 2022}}</ref>

Halifax has two distinct areas: its rural area and its urban area. Since 1 April 1996, the entirety of the [[Halifax County, Nova Scotia|County of Halifax]] and all of its places (cities, suburbs, towns, and villages) were turned into communities of a larger single-tier municipality called Halifax Regional Municipality. As of 2021, the total surface area of the municipality is {{convert|5475.57|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name="statcan1"/>

The Halifax Regional Municipality occupies an area comparable in size to the total land area of the province of [[Prince Edward Island]], and measures approximately {{convert|165|km|abbr=on}} in length between its eastern and westernmost extremities, excluding [[Sable Island]]. The nearest point of land to Sable Island is not in HRM, but rather in adjacent [[Guysborough County, Nova Scotia|Guysborough County]]. However, Sable Island is considered part of District 7 of the Halifax Regional Council.

The coastline is heavily indented, accounting for its length of approximately {{convert|400|km|abbr=on}}, with the northern boundary of the municipality usually being between {{convert|50|and|60|km|abbr=on}} inland. The coast is mostly rock with small isolated sand beaches in sheltered bays. The largest coastal features include [[St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia|St. Margarets Bay]], [[Halifax Harbour]]/[[Bedford Basin]], [[Cole Harbour (natural harbour)|Cole Harbour]], [[Musquodoboit Harbour]], Jeddore Harbour, Ship Harbour, Sheet Harbour, and Ecum Secum Harbour. The municipality's topography spans from lush [[farmland (farming)|farmland]] in the [[Musquodoboit Valley]] to rocky and heavily forested rolling hills. It includes a number of islands and peninsulas, among them [[McNabs Island]], [[Beaver Island, Nova Scotia|Beaver Island]], [[Melville Island (Nova Scotia)|Melville Island]], [[Deadman's Island (Nova Scotia)|Deadman's Island]] and [[Sable Island]].

====Regional Centre====
The Halifax Regional Centre includes the [[Halifax Peninsula]], and [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia|Dartmouth]] inside the Circumferential Highway. The new inner urban area covers {{convert|3,300|ha|km2 mi2|abbr=off}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Item No. 4 |url=https://www.halifax.ca/sites/default/files/documents/city-hall/standing-committees/190607esc4.pdf |website=halifax.ca |publisher=Government of the Municipality of Halifax |access-date=15 May 2021 |archive-date=June 7, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190607025317/https://www.halifax.ca/sites/default/files/documents/city-hall/standing-committees/190607esc4.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> and houses 96,619 people in 55,332 dwelling units as of the 2016 Census.<ref>{{cite web |title=Halifax Regional Centre Secondary Municipal Planning Strategy |url=https://www.halifax.ca/sites/default/files/documents/city-hall/boards-committees-commissions/Attachment%20A%20-%20Regional%20Centre%20Package%20A%20SMPS.pdf |website=halifax.ca |publisher=Government of the Municipality of Halifax. |access-date=24 May 2021 |archive-date=August 16, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210816021929/https://www.halifax.ca/sites/default/files/documents/city-hall/boards-committees-commissions/Attachment%20A%20-%20Regional%20Centre%20Package%20A%20SMPS.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> The Regional Centre has many public services within its boundaries, and it hosts large entertainment venues ([[Scotiabank Centre]]), and major hospitals ([[Dartmouth General Hospital]], the [[QEII Health Sciences Centre]], and [[IWK Health Centre]]).

====Communities and neighbourhoods====
{{main|Communities in the Halifax Regional Municipality}}
Halifax is geographically large, and there are over 200 official communities and neighbourhoods within the municipality. They vary from rural to urban. The former [[town]] of [[Bedford, Nova Scotia|Bedford]], and the former cities of [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia|Dartmouth]] and [[History of Halifax (former city)|Halifax]] have maintained their original geographic names. Furthermore, communities that were [[suburban]], or even [[rural]] before 1996, now have become more urban and have attained ''community'' status (e.g. [[Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia|Cole Harbour]], [[Lower Sackville, Nova Scotia|Lower Sackville]], [[Spryfield, Nova Scotia|Spryfield]], et cetera).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://halifax.ca/regionalplanning/Region/region.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040601214141/http://www.halifax.ca/regionalplanning/Region/region.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 1, 2004 |title=HRM - Regional Planning |publisher=Halifax.ca |date=August 25, 2006 |access-date=April 8, 2011 }}</ref> These community names are used on survey and [[map]]ping documents, for [[9-1-1]] service, municipal planning, and postal service.

Before the [[Amalgamation of the Halifax Regional Municipality|amalgamation of Halifax in 1996]], and since its restructure as a [[Amalgamation of the Halifax Regional Municipality|municipality]], the growth of Halifax has gradually increased. Many of the present day communities within the [[conurbation]] have morphed from being primarily rural in the recent past, to now primarily urban. With the demographic change and growth of many communities within urban Halifax, their function and role within the [[conurbation]] has changed. With this continuous growth, many of the current communities have developed ''de facto'' [[central business districts|business districts]] where residents of their respective communities (and their respective environs) can access products and services without travelling long distances (e.g. to [[Downtown Dartmouth]] or to [[Downtown Halifax]]).

====Community planning areas====
[[File:Novascotiahrm-detail-map.gif|thumb|A map of Halifax's Community Planning Areas]]
Currently, the municipality is divided into 21 community planning areas which are further divided into neighbourhoods.<ref>{{cite web |title=Community Plan Area |url=https://www.halifax.ca/about-halifax/regional-community-planning/community-plan-areas |website=halifax.ca |publisher=Government of the Municipality of Halifax |access-date=10 October 2022 |date=18 January 2022}}</ref> The regional municipality has taken steps to reduce duplicate street names for its 9-1-1 emergency dispatch services; at the time of amalgamation, some street names were duplicated several times throughout the municipality.<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070614065021/http://halifax.ca/civicaddress/documents/HRMstreetlist.pdf Halifax Regional Municipality - Official Street List] PDF file from HRM Civic Addressing Department</ref>

===Rural landscape===
Halifax is centred on the urban core and surrounded by areas of decreasing population density. Rural areas lie to the east, west and north of the urban core. The [[Atlantic Ocean]] lies to the south. Certain rural communities on the urban fringe function as [[suburban]] or [[exurban]] areas, with the majority of those residents commuting to and working in the urban core.

Farther away, rural communities in the municipality function like any resource-based area in Nova Scotia, being sparsely populated and their local economies based on four major resource industries: [[agriculture]], in the Musquodoboit Valley, [[fishing]], along the coast, [[mining]], in the Musquodoboit Valley<ref>{{cite web|title=Mosher Limestone|url=http://www.mosherlimestone.com/|publisher=Mosher Limestone Co.

The northeastern area of the municipality, centred on [[Sheet Harbour, Nova Scotia|Sheet Harbour]] and the Musquodoboit Valley, is completely rural, with the area sharing more in common with the adjacent rural areas of neighbouring [[Guysborough County, Nova Scotia|Guysborough]], [[Pictou County, Nova Scotia|Pictou]] and [[Colchester County, Nova Scotia|Colchester]] counties.

Halifax is a major cultural centre within the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic provinces]]. The municipality has maintained many of its maritime and military traditions, while opening itself to a growing multicultural population. The municipality's urban core also benefits from a large population of post-secondary students who strongly influence the local cultural scene. Halifax has a number of art galleries, theatres and museums, as well as most of the region's national-quality sports and entertainment facilities. Halifax is also the home to many of the region's major cultural attractions, such as [[Halifax Pop Explosion]], [[Symphony Nova Scotia]], the [[Art Gallery of Nova Scotia]], [[The Khyber]], the [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]] and the Neptune Theatre. The region is noted for the strength of its music scene and nightlife, especially within the urban communities; see [[List of musical groups from Halifax, Nova Scotia]] for a partial list.

[[File:HistoricHalifax.jpg|thumb|The [[Historic Properties (Halifax)|Historic Properties]], a collection of historical buildings on Halifax's boardwalk]]
Halifax hosts a wide variety of festivals that take place throughout the year, including; the largest Canada Day celebration east of Ottawa, the [[Atlantic Film Festival]], the Halifax International Busker Festival, Greekfest, Atlantic Jazz Festival, the Multicultural Festival, [[Natal Day]], [[White Night festivals|Nocturne Festival]], the [[Halifax Pop Explosion]], periodic Tall Ship events, the [[Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo]], and Shakespeare by the Sea—to name a few. [[Halifax Pride]] is the largest LGBT event in Atlantic Canada and one of the largest in the country. Many of Halifax's festivals and annual events have become world-renowned over the past several years.

Halifax is home to many performance venues, namely the Music Room, the [[Neptune Theatre (Halifax)|Neptune Theatre]], and [[Dalhousie Arts Centre|Rebecca Cohn Auditorium]]. The Neptune Theatre, a 43-year-old establishment located on Argyle Street, is Halifax's largest theatre. It performs an assortment of professionally produced plays year-round. The [[Shakespeare by the Sea, Halifax|Shakespeare by the Sea]] theatre company performs at nearby [[Point Pleasant Park]]. Eastern Front Theatre performs at [[Alderney Landing]] in [[Downtown Dartmouth]] which can easily be accessed via the [[Halifax Transit]] [[ferry]] service. There are smaller performance venues at the [[Halifax Central Library]], [[Citadel High School]] (Spatz Theatre), and [[Halifax West High School]] ([[Bella Rose Arts Centre]]).

Halifax has also become a significant film production centre, with many American and Canadian filmmakers using the streetscapes, often to stand in for other cities that are more expensive to work in. The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] has its Atlantic Canada production centres (radio and television) based in Halifax, and quite a number of radio and television programs are made in the region for national broadcast. In 2020, filming began on the series Pub Crawl, which explores the historically significant bars of Halifax.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nsi-canada.ca/2021/02/unscripted-series-pub-crawl-directed-by-jon-mann-and-starring-rob-ramsay-now-available-on-bell-fibe-tv-1/ |title=Unscripted series Pub Crawl, directed by Jon Mann and starring Rob Ramsay, now available on Bell Fibe TV 1 |website=National Screen Institute - Canada (NSI) |date=2021-02-10 |access-date=2022-02-14 |archive-date=January 28, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220128233521/https://nsi-canada.ca/2021/02/unscripted-series-pub-crawl-directed-by-jon-mann-and-starring-rob-ramsay-now-available-on-bell-fibe-tv-1/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Halifax Town Clock - cdnav8r.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Halifax Town Clock]] overlooks most of downtown Halifax.]]
Halifax's urban core is home to a number of regional landmark buildings and retains significant historic buildings and districts. Downtown office towers are overlooked by the fortress of [[Citadel Hill (Fort George)|Citadel Hill]] with its iconic [[Halifax Town Clock]].

The architecture of Halifax's [[South End, Halifax|South End]] is renowned for its grand Victorian houses while the [[West End, Halifax|West End]] and [[North End, Halifax]] have many blocks of well-preserved wooden residential houses with notable features such as the "Halifax Porch". [[Dalhousie University]]'s campus is often featured in films and documentaries. Surrounding areas of the municipality, including Dartmouth and Bedford, also possess their share of historic neighbourhoods and properties.

The urban core is home to several blocks of typical North American high-rise office buildings; however, segments of the downtown are governed by height restrictions, known as "view planes legislation", which prevent buildings from obstructing certain sight lines between [[Citadel Hill (Fort George)|Citadel Hill]] and the [[Halifax Harbour]]. This has resulted in some modern high rises being built at unusual angles or locations.

===Public spaces===
{{main|Parks in Halifax, Nova Scotia}}
[[File:CA-halifax-publ-garden-05.jpg|thumb|left|[[Halifax Public Gardens]], a [[Victorian era]] public garden that was designated as a [[National Historic Sites of Canada]] in 1984]]
The Halifax area has a variety of public spaces, ranging from urban gardens, public squares, expansive forested parks, and historic sites. The original grid plan devised when Halifax was founded in 1749 included a central [[military parade]] square, the [[Grand Parade (Halifax)|Grand Parade]]. The square hosts the City Hall at one end, and is a popular site for concerts, political demonstrations, as well as the annual [[Remembrance Day]] ceremony at the central [[cenotaph]]. Another popular downtown public space is the timber [[Halifax Boardwalk]], which stretches approximately {{convert|3|km|abbr=on}} and is integrated with several squares and monuments.

The [[Halifax Common]], granted for the use of citizens in 1763, is Canada's oldest public park.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parks Civic Support Program|url=https://www.halifax.ca/MunicipalOps/documents/GiftsforParksBrochure.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715170028/http://www.halifax.ca/MunicipalOps/documents/GiftsforParksBrochure.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 15, 2014|publisher=Halifax Regional Municipality|access-date=May 29, 2015}}</ref> Centrally located on the Halifax peninsula, the wide fields are a popular location for sports. The slopes of [[Citadel Hill (Fort George)|Citadel Hill]], overlooking downtown, are favoured by sunbathers and kite-flyers. The [[Halifax Public Gardens]], a short walk away, are Victorian era public gardens formally established in 1867 and designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site]] in 1984. [[Victoria Park, Halifax, Nova Scotia|Victoria Park]], across the street, contains various monuments and statues erected by the [[North British Society]], as well as a fountain. In contrast to the urban parks, the expansive [[Point Pleasant Park]] at the southern tip of the peninsula is heavily forested and contains the remains of numerous British fortifications.

Located on the opposite side of the harbour, the [[Dartmouth Commons]] is a large park next to [[Downtown Dartmouth]] laid out in the 1700s. It is home to the Leighton Dillman gardens and various sports grounds. Nearby, the Dartmouth waterfront trail stretches from Downtown Dartmouth to Woodside. Among residents of central Dartmouth, the area around [[Sullivan's Pond]] and [[Lake Banook]] is popular for strolling and paddling. The forested [[Shubie Park]], through which the historic [[Shubenacadie Canal]] runs, is a major park in suburban Dartmouth.

[[Mainland Halifax]] is home to several significant parks, including [[Sir Sandford Fleming Park]], gifted to the people of Halifax by Sir [[Sandford Fleming]]. It houses the Dingle Tower, dedicated in 1912 by the [[Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Duke of Connaught]] to commemorate 150 years of representative government in Nova Scotia. The Mainland Common, in [[Clayton Park, Nova Scotia|Clayton Park]], is a modern park home to various sports and community facilities. [[Long Lake Provincial Park (Nova Scotia)|Long Lake Provincial Park]], comprising more than 2,000 hectares, was designated in 1984 and affords Halifax residents access to a scenic wilderness in close proximity to the urban communities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Long Lake Provincial Park Draft Park Management Plan|url=https://novascotia.ca/natr/parks/management/longlake.asp|publisher=Province of Nova Scotia|access-date=May 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922195700/https://novascotia.ca/natr/parks/management/longlake.asp|archive-date=September 22, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>
