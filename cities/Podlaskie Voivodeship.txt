'''Podlaskie Voivodeship''' ({{langx|pl|Województwo podlaskie}} {{IPA|pl|vɔjɛˈvut͡stfɔ pɔˈdlaskʲɛ||LL-Q809 (pol)-KaMan-województwo podlaskie.wav}}) is a [[Voivodeships of Poland|voivodeship]] ([[province]]) in northeastern [[Poland]]. The name of the province refers to the historical region of [[Podlachia]] (in Polish, ''Podlasie''), and part of its territory corresponds to that region.<ref>[https://tvn24.pl/tvnmeteo/ciekawostki/podlasie-gdzie-jest-co-zwiedzic-i-zjesc-na-podlasiu-i-w-woj-podlaskim-5594285 Podlasie - bogactwo różnorodności] (in Polish) {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220706071430/https://tvn24.pl/tvnmeteo/ciekawostki/podlasie-gdzie-jest-co-zwiedzic-i-zjesc-na-podlasiu-i-w-woj-podlaskim-5594285 |date=2022-07-06 }}</ref> The capital and largest city is [[Białystok]].

It borders on [[Masovian Voivodeship]] to the west, [[Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship]] to the northwest, [[Lublin Voivodeship]] to the south, the [[Belarus]]ian [[Regions of Belarus|oblasts]] of [[Grodno Region|Grodno]] and [[Brest Region|Brest]] to the east, the [[Lithuania]]n [[Counties of Lithuania|Counties]] of [[Alytus County|Alytus]] and [[Marijampolė County|Marijampolė]] to the northeast, and the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] of [[Russia]] to the north.

The province was created on 1 January 1999, pursuant to the [[Polish local government reforms]] adopted in 1998, from the former [[Białystok Voivodeship (1975–98)|Białystok]] and [[Łomża Voivodeship]]s and the eastern half of the former [[Suwałki Voivodeship]].

==Etymology==
The voivodeship takes its name from the [[Polish historical regions|historic region of Poland]] called ''Podlasie'', or in [[Latin]] known as [[Podlachia]].

There are two opinions regarding the origin of the region's name{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}. People often derive it from the [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]] ''les'' or ''las'', meaning "forest", i.e., it is an area "by the wood(s)" or an "area of forests", which would bring ''Podlasie'' close in meaning to adjacent ''[[Polesia]]''. This theory has been questioned, as it does not properly take into consideration the vowel shifts "a" > "e" > "i" in various Slavic languages (in fact, it mixes vowels from different languages).{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Heavily wooded Podlaskie is home to the primeval [[Białowieża Forest]] and National Park, the habitat of the European [[wisent]] bison and [[tarpan]].

A second view holds that the term comes from the expression ''pod Lachem'', i.e., "under the Poles" (see: [[Lechia]]). Some claim it to mean "under Polish rule", which does not seem historically sound, as the area belonged to the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] until 1569, and the southern part of it—until 1795.

A better variant of the latter theory holds that the name originates from the period when the territory was within the [[Trakai Voivodeship]] of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], along the border with [[Mazovia]] Province, primarily a fief of the [[Kingdom of Poland of the Piasts|Poland of the Piasts]], and later part of the [[Kingdom of Poland of the Jagiellons]]. Hence ''pod Lachem'' would mean "near the Poles", "along the border with Poland". The Lithuanian name of the region, ''Palenkė'', has exactly this meaning.

==History==
[[File:Krainy-historyczne-Polski.png|thumb|Historical regions in Podlaskie Voivodeship and in Poland]]
{{main|History of Podlaskie Voivodeship}}
The voivodeship was created on January 1, 1999, out of the former [[Białystok Voivodeship (1975–98)|Białystok]] and [[Łomża Voivodeship]]s and the eastern half of the former [[Suwałki Voivodeship]], pursuant to the [[Polish local government reforms]] adopted in 1998.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The history of Podlaskie Voivodeship |url=https://www.wrotapodlasia.pl/en/region/history/The_history_of_Podlaskie_Voivodeship.html |access-date=2024-06-20 |website=Wrota Podlasia |language=en}}</ref>

==Geography==
It has a varied landscape, shaped in the north by Baltic glaciation, the rest by Middle Poland glaciation. The highest peaks are in the north (Rowelska Top - 298 m), where the landscape is dominated by a hilly lake district. Lakeland: Zachodniosuwalskie, Wschodniosuwalskie, Ełckie) and Sandrowy lake district (Augustów Plain) in the central and southern pre-glacial plains prevail (plateaus: Kolneńska, Białystok, Wysokomazowiecka, Drohiczynska, Sokólskie Hills, Międzyrzecko łomżyński, Plain Bielsko), varied in topography with small basins and river valleys. Kurpie lies on the west edge of the outwash plains. Sand, gravel, clay, moraine, and in the valleys and basins of the rivers silt, sand and river peat predominate on the surface.

==Environment==
[[File:Wisentsauerland.jpg|thumb|The [[Białowieża Forest]] is a [[World Heritage Sites in Poland|UNESCO World Heritage Site]]]]
The vast forests ([[Białowieża Forest|Białowieża]], [[Augustów Primeval Forest|Augustów]], [[Knyszyń Forest Landscape Park|Knyszyń]], [[Puszcza Kurpiowska|Kurpiowska]]), some of which are the only ones in Europe to have retained their original character, contain a unique wealth of flora and fauna. The vegetation of the region is extremely diverse, which contributes to the richness of the animal world. Visitors can also see moose, wolves, lynx and bison living in the [[Białowieża Forest]] and [[Knyszyń Forest Landscape Park|Knyszyń Forest]].

Podlaskie has the lowest population density of the sixteen Polish voivodeships, and its largely unspoiled nature is one of its chief assets. Around 30% of the area of the voivodeship is under legal protection. The Polish part of the [[Białowieża Forest]] [[biosphere reserve]] (also a [[World Heritage Site]]) is in Podlaskie. There are four [[National Park]]s ([[Białowieża Forest|Białowieża]], [[Biebrza National Park|Biebrza]], [[Narew National Park|Narew]] and [[Wigry National Park|Wigry]]), three [[Landscape Park (Poland)|Landscape Parks]] ([[Knyszyń Forest Landscape Park|Knyszyń Forest]], [[Łomża Landscape Park|Łomża]] and [[Suwałki Landscape Park|Suwałki]]), 88 nature reserves, and 15 [[protected areas of Poland|protected landscape areas]]. The voivodeship constitutes a part of the ecologically clean area known as "the Green Lungs of Poland".

==Climate==
Podlaskie has a [[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb/Dsb: Mild to warm summer subtype|Warm Summer Continental]] or [[Hemiboreal]] climate (Dfb) according to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system, which is characterized by warm temperatures during summer and long and frosty winters. It is substantially different from most of the other Polish lowlands. The region is one of the coldest in Poland, with the average temperature in January being {{convert|-5|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The average temperature in a year is {{convert|7|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The number of frost days ranges from 50 to 60, with frost from 110 to 138 days and the duration of snow cover from 90 to 110 days. Mean annual rainfall values oscillate around {{convert|550|mm|in|1}}, and the vegetation period lasts 200 to 210 days.<ref>[http://www.info.bialystok.pl/info/klimat/obiekt.php Białystok - Klimat - INFORMATOR BIAŁOSTOCKI<!-- Tytuł wygenerowany przez bota -->]</ref>

Podlaskie is the coldest region of Poland, located in the very northeast of the country near the border with [[Belarus]] and [[Lithuania]]. The region has a [[continental climate]] which is characterized by high temperatures during summer and long and frosty winters. The climate is affected by the cold fronts which come from [[Scandinavia]] and [[Siberia]]. The average temperature in the winter ranges from -15&nbsp;°C (5&nbsp;°F) to -4&nbsp;°C (24.8&nbsp;°F).<ref>{{cite web |title=Weatherbase: Historical Weather for Białystok, Poland |url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=59221 |access-date= September 27, 2016}}</ref>

One of the cities located in Podlaskie - Suwalki - is called as ''The Polish North Pole,'' due to it is coldest temperature average around Poland.

==Subdivisions and Białystok Metropolitan Region==
[[Image:Podlaskie mapa.png|thumb|right|Map of the Podlaskie Voivodeship]]
{{main|Subdivisions of Podlaskie Voivodeship}}
Podlaskie Voivodeship is divided into 17 counties ([[powiat]]s): 3 city counties, those being [[Białystok]], [[Suwałki]], and [[Łomża]]. It is also divided into 14 land counties, which these 14 counties are further divided into 118 [[gmina]]s.

{{main|Metropolitan Białystok}}
Metropolitan Białystok was designated by the Voivodeship in the Regulation No. 52/05 of 16 May 2005 <ref>[http://www.bialystok.uw.gov.pl/dzienniki/dzienniki/684.pdf Rozporządzenie Nr 52/05 Wojewody Podlaskiego z dnia 16 maja 2005 r. w sprawie wyznaczenia aglomeracji Białystok (Dz. Urz. Woj. Podl. Nr 130, poz. 1547)]</ref> in order to help economically develop the region. In 2006, the metropolitan area's population was 450,254 inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.pl/web/uw-podlaski|title=Podlaski Urząd Wojewódzki w Białymstoku - Podlaski Urząd Wojewódzki w Białymstoku - Portal Gov.pl|website=Podlaski Urząd Wojewódzki w Białymstoku}}</ref> It covers an area of 1.521&nbsp;km ². For one km<sup>2</sup>, there are about 265 people. Among urban residents there are more women - 192 thousand. For every 100 men, there are 108 women on average. The municipalities adjacent to Białystok are slowly losing their agricultural character, becoming residential suburban neighborhoods.

Eastward of Podlaskie lie historic Polish lands, which are now part of [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]] and [[Lithuania]]. Today, mainly [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]) are spoken in Podlaskie, while [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] is preserved by the small but compact [[Lithuanian minority in Poland|Lithuanian minority]] concentrated in the Sejny County.

At the end of 2009 in Podlaskie Voivodeship there were 1,189,700 inhabitants, 3.1 percent of the total population of Poland. The average density of the population, the number of the population per 1 km2, was 59. The urban population in the same period was 60.2 percent of the total number of inhabitants of the voivodeship, where the percentage of females in the total population amounted to 51.3 percent. A statistical inhabitant of Podlaskie was 37.7 years old, whereas in 2008 – 37.5 years old. The latest population projection predicts a consistent decrease in the population in Podlaskie Voivodeship. In the next 26 years, it will decrease by 117 thousand persons due to the ageing population.

Population according to 2002 census:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pop-stat.mashke.org/poland-ethnic2002.htm|title=Ethnic composition of Poland|website=pop-stat.mashke.org|accessdate=2016-05-04|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211128071609/http://pop-stat.mashke.org/poland-ethnic2002.htm|archive-date=2021-11-28}}</ref>

According to 2021 census the dominant religions in Podlaskie Voivodeship are Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy.

==Government==
The voivodeship's seat is the city of [[Białystok]]. Like all voivodeships, it has a government-appointed [[Voivode|Provincial Governor]]<ref name="GovtNames">{{cite web |url=http://www.msz.gov.pl/Agreement,regarding,the,placement,in,Poland,of,anti-ballistic,defensive,missile,interceptors,20825.html |title=Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Agreement Article XI, ''Coordination with Polish Authorities'' |date=2007-12-31 |language=pl}}</ref> ({{langx|pl|wojewoda}}), as well as an elected [[Podlaskie Regional Assembly|Regional Assembly]] ([[voivodeship sejmik|sejmik]]) and of the executive elected by that assembly, headed by the voivodeship marshal (''marszałek województwa''). Administrative powers and competences are statutorily divided between these authorities.
