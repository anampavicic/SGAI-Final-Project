'''Azamgarh''' is a city in the Indian [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. It is the headquarters of [[Azamgarh division]], which consists of [[Ballia district|Ballia]], [[Mau district|Mau]] and [[Azamgarh district|Azamgarh]] districts. Azamgarh is situated on the bank of [[Tamsa River]] (Tons). It is located {{cvt|268|km}} east of the state capital [[Lucknow]] and 809&nbsp;km from the national capital, [[Delhi]].

==History==
{{More citations needed section|date=July 2013}}
Azamgarh, one of the easternmost districts (a district in [[Purvanchal]] sub-region) of [[Uttar Pradesh]], once part of the ancient [[Kosala]] kingdom, except its north-eastern part. Azamgarh is also known as the land of the sage Durvasa whose ashram was located in Phulpur tehsil, near the confluence of Tamsa and Majhuee rivers, {{convert|6|km}} north of the Phulpur.

The district is named after its headquarters town, Azamgarh, which was founded in 1665 by Azam, son of Vikramajit. Vikramajit was a descendant of [[Gautam Rajput]]s of Mehnagar in Pargana Nizamabad who like some of his predecessors had embraced Islam. He had two sons, Azam and Azmat. While Azam gave his name to the town of Azamgarh, and the fort, Azmat constructed the fort and settled the bazaar of [[Azmatgarh]] pargana Sagri.<ref>{{cite web|title=Origin of Name of Azamgarh|url=http://www.azamgarh.nic.in/history.htm|access-date=28 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627133805/http://www.azamgarh.nic.in/history.htm|archive-date=27 June 2014}}</ref>  After the attack of Chabile Ram, Azmat Khan fled northwards followed by the interior forces. He attempted to cross the [[Ghaghra]] into [[Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh|Gorakhpur]], but the people on the other side opposed his landing, and he was either shot in mid stream or was drowned in attempting to escape by swimming.

In 1688 A.D. during Azmat's{{Dubious|date=January 2013}}<!-- Or Azam? Or Azmat? --> lifetime, his eldest son Ekram took part in the management of the state, and after Azam's{{Dubious|date=January 2013}}<!-- Or Azmat? Or Azamt? --> death he was perhaps left in possession together with Mohhabat, another son. The remaining two sons were taken away and for a time detained as hostages for their brothers' 'good behaviour'.

The successor of Ikram finally confirmed the title of his family to the Jamidari. Ikram left no heirs and was succeeded by Iradat, son of Mohhabat. But the real ruler all along had been Mohhabat, and after Ikram's death, he continued to rule in his son's name.

== Geography ==
Azamgarh has an average elevation of 64&nbsp;metres (209&nbsp;feet).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/36/Azamgarh.html |title=Falling Rain Genomics, Inc – Azamgarh |publisher=Fallingrain.com |access-date=30 May 2012}}</ref> The district consists of a series of parallel ridges, whose summits are depressed into beds or hollows, along which the rivers flow; while between the ridges are low-lying rice lands, interspersed with numerous natural reservoirs.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Azamgarh|volume=3|page=79}}</ref> The soil is fertile, and very highly cultivated, bearing good crops of rice, sugarcane, and wheat and orchards of mango and guava.
