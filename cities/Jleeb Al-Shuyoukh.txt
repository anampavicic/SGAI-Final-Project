'''Jleeb Al-Shuyoukh''' or '''Jileeb Al-Shiyukh''' ({{langx|afb|جليب الشيوخ}}, pronounced {{IPA|/d͡ʒɪliːb lɪʃjuːχ/}}), often shortened to just '''Jilīb'''/'''Jileeb''' (الجليب), is one of the oldest and most congested areas in [[Kuwait]]. It is located within [[Farwaniya Governorate]] and borders [[Kuwait International Airport]]. It is largely inhabited by [[expatriates]] from  countries such as [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]]. There are even many [[Dawoodi Bohra|Dawoodi Bohras]] residing in Jleeb-Al-Shuyoukh

Jilīb is divided into 5 [[Block (Kuwait)|blocks]], with a mosque in every block. Block 4, where a lot of [[Kuwaitis|Kuwaiti]] nationals live, is also known as '''ʿAbbāsīya''' (العباسية). Jleeb Al-Shuyoukh Co-Op Society operates there. Blocks 2 and 3 are known as '''il-Ḥasāwi''' (الحساوي).

Many newly constructed areas are being or have been built recently around Jilīb, including [[Abdullah Al-Mubarak|ʿAbdalla Al-Mubarak]], formerly known as West Jilīb.

Jilīb houses telecommunication exchange that serves communications needs of the airport and of [[Dhajeej]],{{citation needed|date=September 2023}} a major commercial centre in Farwaniya Governorate.

==Etymology==
The term ''jilīb'' [[wikt:جليب|جليب]] is a [[Kuwaiti Arabic]] term that means (water) [[well]], whereas ''Shyūkh'' شيوخ is the Arabic [[broken plural|plural]] for [[sheikh]]. The area was named after a water well that was dug by two of Kuwait's [[Emir]] [[Mubarak The Great]]'s brothers.
