'''North Brabant''' ({{langx|nl|Noord-Brabant}} {{IPA|nl|ˌnoːrd ˈbraːbɑnt||170 Noord-Brabant.ogg}}; {{langx|nl|Broabant|label=[[Brabantian dialect|Brabantian]]}} {{IPA|nl|ˈbrɑːban||generic=yes}}), also unofficially called '''Brabant''', is a [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] in the south of the [[Netherlands]]. It borders the provinces of [[South Holland]] and [[Gelderland]] to the north, [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] to the east, [[Zeeland]] to the west, and the [[Flanders|Flemish]] provinces of [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]] and [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]] to the south. The northern border follows the [[Meuse]] westward to its mouth in the [[Hollands Diep]] [[strait]], part of the [[Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta]]. North Brabant had a population of about 2,626,000<ref name="auto"/> as of January 2023. Major cities in North Brabant are [[Eindhoven]] (pop. 231,642<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/70072ned/table|title=CBS Statline|website=opendata.cbs.nl}}</ref>), [[Tilburg]] (pop. 217,259), [[Breda]] (pop. 183,873), its provincial capital [['s-Hertogenbosch]] (pop. 154,205), and [[Helmond]] (pop. 94,967)

== History ==
[[File:De-Groote-Pleen-Landschaft-2015-01.jpg|thumb|left|[[De Groote Peel National Park]]]]
The [[Duchy of Brabant]] was a state of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] established in 1183 or 1190.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Brabant (duchy)}}</ref> It developed from the [[Landgraviate of Brabant]] and formed the heart of the historic Low Countries, part of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] from 1430 and of the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] from 1482, until it was split up after the Dutch revolt. After the [[Eighty Years' War|War of Independence]], Catholics in the [[Southern Netherlands]] were systematically and officially discriminated against by the Northern Protestant government until the second half of the 19th century, which had a major influence on the economic and cultural development of the southern part of the Netherlands.

Present-day North Brabant (''Staats-Brabant'') was adjudicated to the [[Generality Lands]] of the [[Dutch Republic]] according to the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]], while the reduced duchy remained in existence with the Southern Netherlands until it was conquered by French Revolutionary forces in 1794.

Until the 17th century, the area that now makes up the province of North Brabant was mostly part of the Duchy of Brabant, of which the southern part is now in [[Belgium]]. During the 14th and 15th centuries, the area experienced a golden age—especially the now-Belgian cities of [[Brussels]], [[Mechelen]], [[Leuven]] and [[Antwerp]], and the Dutch cities of [[Breda]], [[Bergen op Zoom]] and [['s-Hertogenbosch]].

After the [[Union of Utrecht]] was signed in 1579, Brabant became a battlefield between the Protestant [[Dutch Republic]] and Catholic [[Spain]], which occupied the southern Netherlands. As a result of the Peace of Westphalia, the northern part of Brabant became part of the Netherlands as the [[territory (country subdivision)|territory]] of Staats-Brabant (Statal Brabant) under [[federation|federal]] rule, in contrast to the founding [[province]]s of the [[Dutch Republic]], which were self-governing.

Attempts to introduce Protestantism into the region were largely unsuccessful; North Brabant remained strongly Catholic. For over a century, North Brabant served mainly as a military buffer zone. In 1796, when the [[confederation|confederate]] Dutch Republic became the [[unitary state|unitary]] [[Batavian Republic]], Staats-Brabant became a province as ''Bataafs Brabant''. This status ended with the reorganisation by the invading [[France|French]], and the area was united into the ''[[The 130 départements|département]]'' of [[Deux-Nèthes]] (present [[Antwerp (province)|province of Antwerp]]).

In 1815, Belgium and the Netherlands were united in the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], and the province of North Brabant was established and so named to distinguish it from [[Antwerp Province|Central Brabant]] and [[Province of Brabant|South Brabant]] in present-day [[Belgium]], which seceded from the Kingdom in 1830. This boundary between the Netherlands and Belgium is special in that it does not form a contiguous line, but leaves a handful of tiny enclaves (and enclaves inside enclaves) on both sides of the border. In fact, the Dutch government generally used the pre-Napoleonic borders in 1815 to divide its provinces, in hommage to the principle of [[Conservation and restoration of cultural property|Restoration]]. A few of these irregularities were corrected ([[Luyksgestel]] was exchanged for [[Lommel]]), [[Huijbergen]] became totally Dutch, but some remain, notably [[Baarle-Hertog]] (Belgian) and [[Baarle-Nassau]] (Dutch).

When the present province was instituted, its territory was expanded with a part of the province of [[Holland]] and the former territory of [[Ravenstein, Netherlands|Ravenstein]], which had previously belonged to the [[Duchy of Cleves]], as well as several small, formerly autonomous entities.

In World War II the area was liberated by the allies during [[Operation Pheasant]] between October 20 to November 4, 1944.

The period from 1900 until the late 1960s is called ''Het Rijke Roomse Leven'' (translated as 'the rich Roman life', with 'Roman' meaning 'Roman Catholic'), an era of strong religious belief.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}} ''Het Rijke Roomse Leven'' came about as result of the emancipatory drive of the province's disadvantaged Catholic population and was supported by a [[Pillarisation|Roman Catholic pillar]], which was directed by the clergy, and not only encompassed churches, but also Roman Catholic schools and hospitals, which were run by nuns and friars. In those days every village in North Brabant had a convent from which the nuns operated. Politically, the province was dominated by Catholic parties: the [[Roman Catholic State Party]] and its post-[[World War II|war]] successor, the [[Catholic People's Party]], which often held around 75% of the vote.

[[File:Zundert welkom in Brabant.jpg|thumb|A sign saying, "Welcome to Brabant". North Brabant is often just referred to as "Brabant".]]
In the 1960s secularisation and the actual emancipation of the Catholic population brought about the gradual dissolution of the Catholic pillar, as church attendance decreased in North Brabant as elsewhere in Western Europe. The influence of ''Het Rijke Roomse Leven'' (The Rich Roman [Catholic] Life) remains in the form of education where some schools are still Roman Catholic (today run by professional teachers and not by nuns) and in North Brabant's culture, politics, mentality and [[Folklore|customs]], such as [[Carnival in the Netherlands|carnival]].{{citation needed|date=October 2022}} 

The interpretation of the Roman Catholic identity in North Brabant has shifted during the last 65 years from religious to [[Cultural Christian|cultural]], but the province still has a distinct Catholic atmosphere when compared to the provinces north of the major rivers. A cultural divide is still found between the "Catholic" south and the "Protestant" north, but with a total of 1.5 million people and 20% of the industrial production in the Netherlands the southern "Catholic" area [[BrabantStad]] has become one of the major economically important, metropolitan regions of the Netherlands.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}} As of 2010, Catholics were no longer a majority of the population in the province of North Brabant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ru.nl/kaski/onderzoek/cijfers-rooms/virtuele_map/kerkgebouwen_en/|title=Kerkgebouwen en parochies|work=KASKI|date=January 2024 }}</ref> Only 1–2% of the total population of the Catholic area attend [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]], and these churchgoers consist mostly of people over 65 years old.<ref>Kerncijfers 2006 uit de kerkelijke statistiek van het Rooms-Katholiek Kerkgenootschap in Nederland, Rapport nr. 561 oktober 2007, Jolanda Massaar- Remmerswaal dr.

== Geography ==
With a population density of 501/km<sup>2</sup>, North Brabant is above average urbanized.<ref>De gemiddelde bevolkingsdichtheid van Nederland bedraagt 403/km² (2012).</ref> The urbanization is at the center of the province at largest, where the 'kite' (the [[Brabantse Stedenrij]] Breda, Tilburg, Eindhoven and 's-Hertogenbosch) is located, the rest of the province has a more rural character. The province has preserved some of its scenic nature well. National parks are found at the [[Loonse en Drunense Duinen|Loonse and Drunen Dunes]], [[De Biesbosch]] and De [[Grote Peel|De Groote Peel]], on the marshes of the [[Meierij]] at [[Oisterwijk]] and [[Boxtel]] (within an area called [[Het Groene Woud]]), the border park [[Kalmthoutse Heide|Zoom-Kalmthoutse Heide]], and in the forested area around [[Breda]]. Also, south of [[Eindhoven]] named [[Campine|De Kempen]] is an area with farmlands and forests. In [[Heeze]], also south of Eindhoven, are the heath areas the ''Groote Heide'' (333 ha) and Strabrechtse Heath (1500 ha) located. The ''Strabrechtse Heide'' holds also the largest [[fen]] of the Netherlands. The ''Beuven'' (Beu fen) measures 85 hectares.

Like most of the Netherlands, North Brabant is mostly flat but nearly every part of North Brabant is above sea level; therefore, there are not as many canals as in the lower parts of The Netherlands. Although most of the population lives in urban areas, the province is scattered with villages around which most of the land is cultivated.

National Parks in North Brabant are:
* [[De Biesbosch]]; National Park;	North Brabant / [[South Holland]];	7.100 ha;	1994
* De [[Kalmthoutse Heide|Zoom-Kalmthoutse Heide]]; Cross-Border Park;	North Brabant / [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]] (Belgium);	3.750 ha;	2001
* De [[Loonse en Drunense Duinen]]; National Park;	North Brabant;	3.400 ha;	2002
* De [[Grote Peel]]; National Park; 	North Brabant / [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]];	1.340 ha;	1993

===De Biesbosch===
The [[De Biesbosch|Biesbosch]] (from ''bies'', "rushes", and ''bosch'', "woodland") is an area southeast of [[Dordrecht]] formed when the dike on the [[Meuse]] burst and the [[St. Elizabeth's flood (1421)|St. Elizabeth's flood]]s on 19 November 1421 engulfed great tracts of land in the southwestern Netherlands and altered the geography of the whole area, inundating over 40,000 hectares (100,000 acres) of land. More than four-fifths of the flooded land has been reclaimed since the 18th century. An area of 6,000 hectares (15,000 acres) was left as it was, and now forms the Biesbosch nature reserve and bird sanctuary.
Until the end of the 1960s the Biesbosch was directly connected with the sea and subject to changing tide levels. As a result, it developed a flora which tolerated brackish water and was the home of numerous waterfowl. Since the damming of the [[Haringvliet]] there is no variation in water level, and both flora and fauna have adapted to the new environment.
The Biesbosch is crisscrossed by a network of footpaths and bike paths and by rivers and streams which offer facilities for water sports (sailing, surfing). In spite of the large numbers of visitors the natural environment has remained largely unspoiled.
The Biesbosch nature reserve can be reached by car only from the east (preferably via [[Werkendam]]). The southwest part of the area, with its three large reservoirs of drinking water, is closed to road traffic. The Biesbosch can also be reached by boat from [[Drimmelen]], [[Geertruidenberg]] or [[Lage Zwaluwe]].

=== De Kempen ===
The historical region of Kempen occupies the southern part of the province of Noord-Brabant and extends south of Eindhoven far into northern [[Belgium]]. To the east it reaches as far as the [[Meuse]] valley. The surface topography of [[Campine|De Kempen]] is very uniform. Most of it lies between 5&nbsp;m (15&nbsp;ft) and 35&nbsp;m (115&nbsp;ft) above sea level. The basement rocks are Cretaceous and Tertiary sediments, which are overlaid by [[Ice age|Ice Age]] gravels and sands carried here by rivers of melt-water from the retreating glaciers. It is a typical area of sandy heathland.
The infertile soil is suitable only for undemanding crops such as rye, oats, potatoes and fodder plants; this limits the profitability of agriculture. Until a few decades ago Kempen was a region of [[heathland]] and sand drifts with a sparse growth of pines, a few scattered villages subsisting on the poor soil and some small towns; and this is still the pattern in much of the region.
In recent years, however, the rapid advance of industry has brought about profound changes in this agricultural region. The origins of this industrial development go back 70–100 years. The main concentrations of industry are along the southern frontier of the Netherlands, e.g., at [[Eindhoven]], [[Helmond]], [[Tilburg]], [[Breda]], [['s-Hertogenbosch]].

===De Peel===
In the east of Noord-Brabant, near the [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]ish border, is the [[Peel, Netherlands|Peel]] area, an expanse of [[moorland]] extending from Eindhoven to [[Venlo]], on the border with Limburg. Southeast of [[Asten, Netherlands|Asten]] is a nature reserve (1,300 hectares (3,250 acres); visitor center at Ospeldijk) which has escaped destruction by peat cutting. Mostly boggy, it will appeal to nature lovers with its interesting flora and fauna. Apart from this small area almost the whole of the Peel has been brought into cultivation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetware.com/tourist-attractions-/north-brabant-nl-nb-nb.htm|title=10 Top-Rated Tourist Attractions in Eindhoven|work=planetware.com}}</ref>

===Rivers and deltas===
The province is bordered by the river [[Meuse]] in the north. Its delta flows through [[De Biesbosch]] area, a national park.

=== Municipalities ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Municipalities of the Netherlands]] -->
North Brabant has been divided into 56 municipalities since 2022. Traditionally, almost every town was a separate municipality, but their number was reduced greatly in the 1990s by incorporating smaller towns into neighbouring cities or by other mergers. The municipalities in North Brabant are:

The main agricultural products are [[maize|sweetcorn]], [[wheat]] and [[sugar beet]], while [[cow]]s and [[pig]]s are held as livestock.

An important economical activity is electronics industry, which developed as a spin-off from [[Philips]]. Several companies originated from Philips, such as Signify (formerly Philips Lighting), [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]] (producer of [[semiconductors]]), and the world's largest supplier of [[photolithography]] systems, [[ASML Holding|ASML]].
There are eight 'innovation campusses' in North Brabant, including the [[High Tech Campus Eindhoven]]. In 2017, Brabantian companies applied for 3655 [[Patent application|patents]], earning a spot in the regional top 5 in Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.omroepbrabant.nl/nieuws/2659050/brabant-in-europese-top-5-van-octrooi-aanvragen|title = Brabant in Europese top 5 van octrooi-aanvragen|date = 7 March 2018}}</ref>

==Language==
[[File:WIKITONGUES- Jan speaking Brabants.webm|thumb|A Brabantian speaker, recorded in [[Slovakia]].]]
[[Brabantian dialect|Brabantian]] is not a minority language in the [[Netherlands]]. It can be divided in two main dialects: [[East Brabantian]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|West Brabantian|nl|3=Noordwest-Brabants}}. Along with the [[Hollandic]] dialects it is one of the two most spoken versions of Dutch. Brabantian has, as compared to the other main Dutch dialects, had a big influence on the development of Standard Dutch. This is because Brabant was the dominant region in the Netherlands when the standardization of Dutch started in the 16th century. The first major formation of standard Dutch also took place in [[Antwerp]], where a Brabantian dialect is spoken. The default language having been developed around this time, it therefore had mainly Brabantian influences. The early modern Dutch written language was initially influenced primarily by Brabantian, with strong influence from [[Hollandic dialect|Hollandic]] emerging after the 16th century. Since the Brabantian dialect has developed faster than 16th- and 17th-century Dutch, it has become more diverse than modern [[Standard Dutch]] but is still quite similar and very understandable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://taal.phileon.nl/brabants.php|title=Taal in Nederland .:. Brabants|work=phileon.nl|access-date=19 March 2014|archive-date=19 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140619102750/http://taal.phileon.nl/brabants.php|url-status=dead}}</ref>
About one third of the Dutch-speaking population lives in the Brabantian dialect zone. Both in large Brabantian towns such as [[Breda]] and [[Eindhoven]] and in rural areas many people still speak the original dialect or colloquial Dutch with a typical "southern" tongue. [[Tilburg]] and [['s-Hertogenbosch]] have a large number of people speaking the Brabantian dialect.

==Culture==

===Cuisine===
The Southern Dutch cuisine constitutes the cuisine of the Dutch provinces of North Brabant and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and the [[Flemish Region]] in [[Belgium]]. It is renowned for its many rich pastries, soups, [[stew]]s, and vegetable dishes and is often called "[[Burgundians|Burgundian]]", which is a Dutch idiom invoking the rich Burgundian court which ruled the [[Low Countries]] in the [[Middle Ages]] and was renowned for its splendor and great feasts.

It is the only Dutch culinary region which developed an ''[[haute cuisine]]'', as it is influenced by both [[German cuisine]] and [[French cuisine]], and it forms the base of most traditional Dutch restaurants including typical [[main course]]s such as ''[[Sirloin steak|Biefstuk]]'', ''[[Fillet (cut)|Varkenshaas]]'', or ''[[Beef tenderloin|Ossenhaas]]'', which are premium cuts of meat, generally [[pork]] or [[beef]], accompanied by various sauces and potatoes which have been double fried in the traditional Dutch (or Belgian) manner.

Stews, such as ''[[hachee]]'', a stew of [[onion]]s, [[beef]] and a thick gravy, contain a lot of flavour and require hours to prepare. Vegetable soups are made from richly flavored [[Stock (food)|stock]] or [[Bouillon (broth)|bouillon]] and typically contain small meatballs alongside a variety of different vegetables. Asparagus and ''[[Chicory|witlo(o)f]]'' are highly prized and traditionally eaten with cheese and/or [[ham]].

Pastries are abundant, often with rich fillings of cream, custard or fruits. Cakes, such as the ''[[Moorkop]]'' and ''[[Bossche Bol]]'' from Brabant, are typical pastries. There are also savory pastries, especially the popular ''worstenbroodje'' (a roll with a sausage of [[ground beef]]).

The traditional alcoholic beverage of the region is beer. There are many local brands, ranging from ''[[Trappist beer|Trappist]]'' to ''[[Kriek lambic|Kriek]]''. Beer, like wine in French cuisine, is also used in cooking, often in stews.

{{update section|date=July 2024}}
The [[States of North Brabant]] (''Staten van Noord-Brabant'') have 55 seats and are headed by the [[King's Commissioner]] (''Commissaris van de Koning''), currently [[Ina Adema]]. Whereas the provincial council (the [[States-Provincial]] - ''Provinciale Staten'') is elected by the inhabitants, the Commissioner is appointed by the King and the cabinet of the Netherlands.

[[Image:Catharinakerk Eindhoven.jpg|thumb|right|St. Catherine's Church, a Roman Catholic church in [[Eindhoven]]]]
Traditionally the province of North Brabant has been strongly [[Roman Catholicism in the Netherlands|Roman Catholic]], in contrast to most of the rest of the Netherlands. Following the country's independence, Catholics faced discrimination by the Protestant government until the mid-19th century. During the 1960s the relatively strong [[verzuiling|demarcation]] between the Catholic south on one side and the [[calvinism|Calvinist]] west and north on the other side of the Netherlands started to diminish. In the second half of the 20th century a rapid secularization took place in North Brabant.

In 2015 slightly fewer than half (48%) of the Brabantian people reported adhering to Catholicism, while 5.6% adhered to the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]], 4.4% to [[Islam]], 3.3% to other churches or faiths. More than a third (38.8%) of the population identified as non-religious. 

Although much of the population identifies as Catholic, regular attendance at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] is low. For example, in the [[Diocese of 's-Hertogenbosch]], the eastern part of North Brabant and part of the province of Gelderland, 1,167,000 people reported in 2006 an association with Roman Catholicism (56.8 percent of the population). However, only 45,645 residents of this area attended the [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] on average, which was only 2 percent of the total population of the area. In western North Brabant ([[Diocese of Breda]]) the number of people associating themselves with Catholicism also strongly decreased; only 52 percent of the West Brabantians [[Cultural Christian|identify]] as Roman Catholic. Church attendance was even lower in the west, with only 1 percent of the West Brabantian population attending Mass.<ref>Kerncijfers 2006
uit de kerkelijke statistiek van het Rooms-Katholiek Kerkgenootschap in Nederland, Rapport nr. 561 oktober 2007, Jolanda Massaar- Remmerswaal dr. Ton Bernts, KASKI, onderzoek en advies over religie en samenleving</ref> North Brabant is mostly Catholic by tradition. Residents may adhere to certain traditions as a base for their [[Cultural Christian|cultural identity]], but the vast majority of the Catholic population is now largely irreligious in practice. Research among Catholics in the Netherlands in 2007 showed that only 27% of the Dutch Catholics could be regarded as [[theist]], while 55% were [[ietsism|ietsist]] or [[nontheist]] and 17% were [[agnostic]].<ref>''God in Nederland'' (1996–2006), by Ronald Meester, G.
