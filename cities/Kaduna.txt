==Etymology==
The etymology of the word ''Kaduna'' is said to be a corruption of the Hausa word for "crocodiles", ''Kaddanni'' in the [[Hausa language]] (''kaduna'' being the plural form).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Kaduna-Nigeria|title=Kaduna {{!}} Location, History, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref> Another version of the name proposes a link to the [[Gbagyi language|Gbagyi]] word/name 'Odna', meaning 'river'.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of the Gbagyi Language|last=Shekwo|first=Joseph Amali|publisher=Centre for Adult Education and Extension Services, Ahmadu Bello University|year=1979|location=Zaria|ol=2795890M|oclc=11043184|url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL2795890M/Fundamentals_of_the_Gbagyi_language}}</ref>

==History==
Kaduna was founded by [[British Empire|British]] colonists in 1900.<ref>Toyin Falola, Ann Genova, Matthew M. Heaton, ''Historical Dictionary of Nigeria'', Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2018, p. 217</ref> The first British governor of Northern Nigeria, Sir [[Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard|Frederick Lugard]], chose the present site for development due to its proximity to the [[Lagos-Kano Railway]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Kaduna|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Kaduna-Nigeria|access-date=13 November 2016|website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref> It became the capital of Nigeria's former [[Northern Region, Nigeria|Northern Region]] in 1917,<ref>{{cite book|last=Fletcher|first=Banister |author2=Dan Cruickshank |title=[[Sir Banister Fletcher's a History of Architecture]] |year=1996|chapter=Africa|publisher=Architectural Press|isbn= 0-7506-2267-9|page=1466}}</ref> and retained this status until 1967.

In 1976, when the General [[Murtala Muhammed|Murtala Mohammed]] administration created seven new states in Nigeria, North Central State, with capital at Kaduna, was renamed Kaduna State. It was made up of the two colonial period Provinces of [[Zaria]] and [[Katsina]]. When in 1991, the number of states in the country was increased from twenty-one to thirty. Katsina Province became Katsina State, while the old Zaria Province became the new Kaduna State. There are twenty-three local government areas (LGAs) in the state, although the number of ethnic groups is much larger.<ref name=":3" />

== Administrative Areas ==

Administration of the state started with the concept of Provincial Administration and Native/Local Authority systems. However, in 1976 the Mohammed Administration introduced the Local Government Area system (LGA) which delegated some responsibilities to the elected/appointed councillors. With each successive Federal Military Administration, the number of the LGAs in Kaduna State increased from fourteen in the early 1980s to the present twenty-three in 1998. In each LGA, smaller units such as districts and wards, are recognised.<ref name=":3" />

== Places of worship ==
Among the [[places of worship]], there are churches and mosques.<ref>J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann, ‘‘Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices’’, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2010, p. 2107</ref> [[Sultan Bello Mosque]] is the biggest and a central mosque in Kaduna. There are also churches: [[Church of Nigeria]] ([[Anglican Communion]]), [[Presbyterian Church of Nigeria]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]), [[Nigerian Baptist Convention]] ([[Baptist World Alliance]]), [[Living Faith Church Worldwide]], [[Redeemed Christian Church of God]], [[Assemblies of God]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kaduna]] ([[Catholic Church]]), [[Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries]], Universal Reformed Christian Church (Protestant Church).<ref>{{cite web |title=Kaduna police arrest kidnappers’ gang leader linked to Catholic church attack |url=https://punchng.com/kaduna-police-arrest-kidnappers-gang-leader-linked-to-catholic-church-attack/ |publisher=The punch newspaper |access-date=23 March 2024}}</ref>

==Climate==
<div style="width:100%;">

[[File:Hayin Amina RGS, effects of erosion 023.jpg|thumb|Erosion Rigasa Kaduna ]]
Climate: Kaduna State experiences a typical tropical continental climate with distinct seasonal regimes, oscillating between cool to hot dry and humid to wel. These two seasons reflect the influ- ences of tropical continental and equatorial mar itime airmasses which sweep over the entire country. However, in Kaduna State, the seasonality is pronounced with the cool to hot dry season being longer than the rainy season. Again, the spatial and temporal distribution of the rain varies. decreasing from an average of about 1530mm in [[Kafanchan|Kafanchan-Kagoro]] areas in the Southeast to about 1015mm in Ikara-Makarfi districts in the northeast. High storm intensities (ranging from 60mm hr-1 to 99mm hr-1) plus the nature of [[surface runoff]] build up the good network of medium sized river sys- temps High evaporation during the dry season ton however, creates water shortage problems espe cinity in [[Igabi]], [[Giwa]], [[Soba]], [[Makarfi]])and [[Ikara]] LGA.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal |last=U. |first=Aleazu |date=1986 |title=Nigeria: After 25 years |journal=Nigeria |volume=2}}</ref>

The Kaduna region has a tropical climate. The summers have a lot more rain than the winters do. The predominant climate in this area is categorised as Aw by the Köppen-Geiger scale. Kaduna's yearly mean temperature is 25.2&nbsp;°C, or 77.4&nbsp;°F. A total of 39.3 inches or 998&nbsp;mm of precipitation falls per year.
