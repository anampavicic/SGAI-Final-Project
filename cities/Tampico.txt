'''Tampico''' is a city and port in the southeastern part of the [[Mexican state]] of [[Tamaulipas]]. It is located on the north bank of the [[Pánuco River]], about {{convert|10|km|0|sp=us}} inland from the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and directly north of the state of [[Veracruz]]. Tampico is the fifth-largest city in Tamaulipas, with a population of 314,418 in the city proper and 929,174 in the [[Tampico metropolitan area|metropolitan area]].

During the period of Mexico's first [[oil boom]] in the early 20th century, the city was the "chief oil-exporting port of the Americas" and the second-busiest in the world, yielding great profits that were invested in the city's famous architecture, often compared to that of [[Venice]] and [[New Orleans]].<ref name="reuters">[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-drugs-oil-idUSKBN0F02I120140625 Dave Graham, "Crime-ridden state poses acid test for Mexican oil reform"], ''Reuters,'' 25 June 2014, accessed 11 December 2014</ref> The first oil well in Mexico was drilled near Tampico in 1901 at [[Ebano, San Luis Potosi|Ébano]].

The city is also a major exporter of [[silver]], [[copper]], and [[lumber]], as well as [[wool]], [[hemp]], and other agricultural products. Containerized cargo is mainly handled by the neighboring ocean port of [[Altamira, Tamaulipas|Altamira]].

==History==
[[Image:Nebel Voyage 12 Tampico de Tamaulipas.jpg|thumb|View of Tampico, 1836]]
The name "Tampico" is of [[Wastek language|Huastec]] origin, ''tam-piko'' meaning "place of otters" (literally "water dogs"). The city is surrounded by rivers and lagoons of the delta of the [[Pánuco River]], which was the habitat of a large population of [[otter]]s. There have been successive human settlements in the area for centuries. The region had several early [[Huastec civilization|Huastec]] settlements, among them the important site at [[Las Flores, Tampico|Las Flores]], which flourished between AD 1000 and 1250.

In 1532, during the [[New Spain|Spanish colonial period]], the Franciscan priest [[Andrés de Olmos]] established a [[Mission (station)|mission]] and monastery in the area, building over a former Huastec village. At his request, Spanish officials founded a settlement named San Luis de Tampico in 1554. This site was abandoned in 1684, and the population relocated to the south of the [[Pánuco River]] because of frequent attacks by pirates. The area was abandoned for nearly 150 years.

The present city was founded on April 13, 1823, on the north bank of the Pánuco River about {{convert|10|km|0|sp=us}} from the Gulf, after Mexico achieved [[Mexican War of Independence|independence from Spain]]. Tampico built its economy on the exportation of silver; business development was mostly as a trading center and market town of an agricultural region. In August 1829, Spain sent troops from [[Cuba]] to [[Battle of Tampico (1829)|invade Tampico]] in an effort to regain control of the region, but in September, General [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] forced the Spanish troops to surrender, and Mexican control of Tampico was reestablished.<ref>Dupuy and Dupuy. ''The Encyclopedia of Military History,'' p. 818</ref>

===20th century to present===
The first oil well in Mexico was drilled near Tampico at [[Ébano, San Luis Potosí|Ébano, S.L.P.]], in 1901, by Californian [[Edward Doheny]], who founded the [[Mexican Petroleum Corporation]].<ref name="wsj"/> In the early 20th century, there was extensive U.S. investment in oil development in Tampico, with a sizable United States expatriate community developing in relation to the industry. With the outbreak of the [[Mexican Revolution]], which lasted roughly from 1910 to 1920, the U.S. monitored the situation to protect its citizens and investments. Doheny sold some of his businesses to the [[Standard Oil Company]] which operated its monopoly here. The oil-producing area was so productive it was called the [[Veracruz#Golden Lane Oil Fields|"Golden Belt]]".<ref name="wsj"/>

The oil fields known as Ébano, Pánuco, Huasteca, and Tuxpan are all situated within a {{convert|160|km|adj=on|sp=us}} radius of the city. Oil was often shipped on barges along the rivers. To improve transportation of oil to the port, the government built the [[Chijol Canal]], beginning in 1901. It is {{convert|6|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} deep and {{convert|25|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} wide and runs {{convert|120|km|abbr=on}} southward through the oil fields to Tuxpan.<ref name="Ebrit">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/582079/Tampico "Tampico"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online,'' accessed 11 December 2014</ref>

During the [[Mexican Revolution]], on April 9, 1914, [[Mexican army|10 Mexican soldiers]] and nine [[U.S. Navy]] sailors from the [[USS Dolphin (PG-24)|USS ''Dolphin'']] confronted each other in a failure to communicate as U.S. forces tried to get fuel supplies. General [[Victoriano Huerta]]'s forces in the city were threatened by different groups from both north and south. The Americans were arrested and later freed, but the U.S. resented Huerta's demands for some recognition. In the resulting [[Tampico Affair]], the U.S. sent naval and marine forces into [[Veracruz (city)|port of Veracruz]] and occupied the city for seven months in a show of force. Due to resulting anti-American demonstrations on each coast, other U.S. Navy ships were used to evacuate some American citizens to refugee camps in southern U.S. cities. The U.S. occupation contributed to the downfall of Huerta, and [[Venustiano Carranza]] became president. He ensured that Mexico maintained neutrality during [[World War I]], in part due to lingering animosity against the U.S. for these actions.

In the 1970s, Tampico annexed the port city and suburb of [[Ciudad Madero]], which now comprises part of the [[Tampico metropolitan area]]. Tampico has a modern port with excellent facilities, as well as rail and air connections to Mexico City and the United States.<ref name="Ebrit"/>

The Mexican government [[Mexican oil expropriation|nationalized the oil industry]] in 1938 and has maintained that for 86 years. In November 2014, President [[Enrique Peña Nieto]] announced a policy change of ending [[Pemex]]'s monopoly and inviting private companies back into the oil and gas industry. While analysts believe the largest finds are likely to be offshore, new techniques may yield oil even at mature fields such as those of Tampico.<ref name="wsj">[https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-oil-boom-simmers-in-mexicos-aging-golden-belt-1415135825 Juan Montes, "A New Oil Boom in Mexico's Aging 'Golden Belt'"], ''Wall Street Journal'', 4 November 2014, accessed 10 December 2014</ref> In early 2015, the government planned to accept bids on 169 blocks, 47 of which are within {{convert|70|mi|km|order=flip|sigfig=2|sp=us}} of Tampico.<ref name="wsj"/> It is expected that smaller companies will be active in the mature fields, such as those in this region. This area has extensive [[tight oil|shale oil]] deposits, and the "[[U.S. Energy Information Administration]] estimates that Mexico has the world's eighth-largest shale-oil resources."<ref name="wsj"/>

==Architecture==
[[Image:Plazacentrotampico.JPG|thumb|Plaza de Armas]]
Tampico's downtown architecture is an eclectic mix, reflecting the growth of the city during the ''[[Porfiriato]]'' (the period of rule by President [[Porfirio Díaz]]). During the oil boom of the first decades of the 20th century, much "grandiose" architecture was built, inviting comparisons with [[Venice]], Italy, and [[New Orleans]] in the United States.<ref name="reuters"/> Many buildings feature wrought-iron balconies (in the 20th century, these were mostly built of English [[cast iron]]). Similar balconies are characteristic of the French and Spanish-influenced architecture in [[New Orleans]]. Some of the balconies in ''Plaza de la libertad'' bear the original plaques showing their manufacture at the [[Derbyshire]] [[forge]] of [[Andrew Handyside and Company]].

Notable buildings include the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] Town Hall (or ''Palacio Municipal'') in ''Plaza de Armas'', and the English redbrick Customs House in the docks. The prevalence of New Orleans-style architecture is attributed to the oil boom years. Not only was there money to spend, but many building supplies, including pre-built housing components, were shipped from New Orleans to this area during that period of rapid development. The historical downtown areas of ''Plaza de Armas'' and ''Plaza de Libertad'' have been restored and improved in recent years to emphasize their historic appeal, in part to encourage more heritage tourism.

The Cathedral of Tampico, also known as the Temple of the [[Immaculate Conception]], located in ''Plaza de Armas'', dates to the late 19th century. It has undergone several restorations. It is of the neoclassical style in light brown canter, with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]]-style columns and three enormous doors that form the entrance. Its two towers are made of three bodies. The eastern one has a large, London-made, public chiming [[clock]], a gift from Don [[Angel Sainz Trapaga]]. Its recently refurbished interior holds several wall paintings and other works of art. The altar is of white [[Carrara]] [[marble]]. The United States oil [[tycoon]] [[Edward Doheny]] of California, who drilled the first oil well in Mexico near Tampico, donated substantial funds for the cathedral's construction and maintenance after 1902, when he based his Mexican oil operations in Tampico.

==Demographics==
According to the [[National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Data Processing|INEGI]] 2010 census, the population of the city of Tampico was 297,284, and that of the municipality of Tampico was 297,554, both ranking fifth in the state of Tamaulipas. The population of the [[Tampico metropolitan area|Tampico—Ciudad Madero—Altamira metropolitan area]] was estimated at 859,419 people in 2010. The municipality has an area of {{convert|92.73|km2|mi2|sigfig=4}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/sistemas/consulta_resultados/iter2010.aspx?c=27329&s=est|title=Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI)|website=www.inegi.org.mx|access-date=18 March 2018}}</ref>
==Geography==
The city is located on the north bank of the [[Pánuco River]], about {{convert|10|km|0|sp=us}} inland from the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and directly north of the state of [[Veracruz]].
===Climate===
[[Image:Tampicoarquitectura.JPG|thumb|Buildings on Calle Juárez]]
Tampico has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Aw''), defined as such based on the mean average temperature of 18&nbsp;°C (65&nbsp;°F) for January as well as on precipitation patterns.<ref name="WMO">[http://worldweather.wmo.int/179/c01298.htm Climate Data for Tampico], World Weather Information Service accessed 20 April 2012.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=928111&cityname=Tampico,+Tamaulipas,+Mexico&units=|title=Tampico, Tamaulipas Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref> Its weather, though relatively mild in spring and autumn, is hot in the summer; the average high reaches 32&nbsp;°C (90&nbsp;°F) in August, with an average low of 23&nbsp;°C (74&nbsp;°F). Winters are warm; the average January high is 23&nbsp;°C (73&nbsp;°F) and the average low in January is 13&nbsp;°C (58&nbsp;°F). Rainfall is frequent from June through October.

Tampico is an extremely humid city, with summer [[heat index|heat indices]] reaching 40&nbsp;°C (104&nbsp;°F). It is located on the Pánuco River and among extensive wetlands adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico. During autumn and winter, it is affected by [[cold front]]s that pass through the gulf and bring high winds that can reach 50&nbsp;km/h (37&nbsp;mph) with gusts of 70 to 80&nbsp;km/h (43 to 50&nbsp;mph). Tampico is also located in a [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]] area, but it has not been directly affected by one since October 1966.

On rare occasions, the city experiences surprisingly low temperatures for its zone; during late January and early February 2011, a cold wave caused temperatures to drop to {{convert|5|C}}, with the lowest being {{convert|0|C}} in the morning and noon of 4 February. In February 1895, snow was reported to have fallen in Tampico. This is the North American record for the farthest south report of snow at a coastal location, and makes Tampico one of the few places where snow has fallen in the tropics at sea level.<ref>''Extreme Weather: A Guide and Record Book;'' Christopher Burt; 2007</ref>

It serves routes to Mexican cities, mainly [[Mexico City]] and [[Monterrey]], and also has international services, with daily flights to [[Houston, Texas]].

The city also has excellent railway facilities serving the port, which is well-developed with warehouses and equipment for loading oil tankers. Major roads connect to the [[Pan-American Highway]].<ref name="Ebrit"/>

==Food==
Tampico is known for its food. Seafood is important in the city. The locals are informally known as ''Jaibas'' ([[crab]]s), and the crab emblem is seen in many places, from sports logos to the sides of buses to park benches. There are also typical dishes of the area, mainly the "[[torta de la barda]]" which is a sandwich that contains over 12 toppings, and the famous "tampiqueña" which is steak with refried beans and "entomatadas" (tortillas with tomato sauce and cheese).

==Education==
The [[Autonomous University of Tamaulipas]] has one of its two largest campuses in Tampico, the other being in [[Ciudad Victoria]]. The major schools of medicine, engineering, nursing, dentistry, architecture, and business are based here.

Multiple [[high school]]s, both private and public, are located in Tampico.

==Sports==

The local professional [[association football|football]] team, [[Tampico Madero F.C.]], was founded in 1945 and is also known as ''La Jaiba Brava''. They currently play in the [[Ascenso MX]], the second tier of the [[Mexican football league system]], and their home stadium has been the 19,415-seat [[Estadio Tamaulipas]] since 1966.

In 1953, Tampico Madero was champion of the [[Primera División de México|México Primera División]] and also won the [[Campeón de Campeones]] title. ''La Jaiba Brava'' won consecutive [[Copa MX|Copa México]] titles in 1960 and 1961. The club spent most of the 1960s and 1970s in relegation but returned to the Primera División for the 1977–78 season. They finished runner-up twice in the shortened [[1985–86 Mexican Primera División season|1985 and 1986 Primera División tournaments]] under Chilean manager [[Carlos Reinoso]] before being relegated again in the early 1990s.
