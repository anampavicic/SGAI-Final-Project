'''Melitopol'''{{efn|See the [[Melitopol#Etymology|§Etymology]] section for native and historical names}} is a [[List of cities in Ukraine|city]] and [[List of hromadas of Ukraine|municipality]] in [[Zaporizhzhia Oblast]], southeastern [[Ukraine]]. It is situated on the [[Molochna River]], which flows through the eastern edge of the city into the [[Molochnyi Lyman]] estuary. Melitopol is the second-largest city in the oblast after [[Zaporizhzhia]] and serves as the administrative centre of [[Melitopol Raion]]. As of January 2022, Melitopol's population was estimated to be {{Ua-pop-est2022|148,851|punct=.|showyear=false}}  

Melitopol has been under [[Russian occupation of Zaporizhzhia Oblast|Russian control]] since March 2022. On September 30, 2022, the city was formally annexed by the [[Russian Federation]]; however, it remains internationally recognized as sovereign territory of Ukraine.

The city is located at the crossing of two major European highways: [[European route E58|E58 Vienna – Uzhhorod – Kyiv – Rostov-on-Don]] and [[European route E105|E105 Kirkenes – St. Petersburg – Moscow – Kyiv – Yalta]]. An electrified railway line of international importance goes through Melitopol. The city was once known as "the gateway to [[Crimea|the Crimea]]"; prior to the 2014 [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russian annexation of Crimea]] 80% of passenger trains heading to the peninsula passed through it and during the summer, road traffic reached 45,000 vehicles per day.

=== Historical names ===
The city was called ''Kyz-Yar'' ({{crh|Qız Yar}}; {{langx|uk|Киз-Яр|links=no}}), and ''Novooleksandrivka'' ({{langx|uk|links=no|Новоолександрівка}}) before 1815 and 1842 respectively. It was renamed to the current name after on.

==History==
In July 1769, Russian military commanders built a [[redoubt]] there, and [[Cossacks|Zaporizhia Cossacks]] carried out their duty service there. On 2 February 1784, [[Catherine II]] issued the decree to create the [[Taurida Oblast]] on the lands that had been won. The deputy of [[Novorossiya]] [[Grigory Potemkin]] signed the relation to establish a town that very year – and Cossacks' families and those of retired soldiers of Suvorov settled on the right bank of the Molochna River. Among others, Germans were encouraged to settle in the new province, and some villages in this area were for many years German-speaking, such as Heidelberg (now Pryshyb) some {{cvt|50|km|0|abbr=off}} to the north of Melitopol.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/GermanRussian/2000-10/0971922660|title=Richard Konkel, genealogist}}</ref>

{{stack|[[File:Novoalexandrovskaya sloboda.jpg|thumb|Novoalexandrovskaya sloboda, Redin and Fomin painting]]}}
In 1816, the settlement got the name ''[[sloboda (settlement)|sloboda]]'' ''of Novoalexandrovka''. Its population was increasing due to the importation of peasants from the northern provinces of Ukraine and Russia. On 7 January 1842, the sloboda was recognized as a town and received the new name of Melitopol after a port city of Melita (from Greek ''Μέλι'' (meli) – "honey") which had been situated on the mouth of the Molochna River. At the end of the 19th century, the "Honey-city"<ref>i.e. '''Meli'''to'''pol''', this is how Melitopol sometimes is referred in the local mass-media</ref> had been developed as a trade center – there were some banks, credit organizations and wholesale stores. The largest enterprises in the city at the time were the iron foundry and the Brothers Klassen's machinery construction factory (1886), the railroad depot and the workshops.

Further development of the city was closely connected with trade, iron and engineering industries, and railway service in the Crimean direction. In the early twentieth century there were fifteen thousand people living in Melitopol. 30 factories and 350 shops operated in the city at that time. In the second half of the twentieth century there was a strong economic growth of the city: new factories, plants, and housing estates were constructed. Sixteen Melitopol business enterprises received All-Soviet Union significance status. Industrial products were exported to more than 50 countries.

===World War II===
In 1941, the [[Soviet Union]] was attacked by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. The city became strategically important due to its location. The [[Red Army]] was not ready for the war and had to retreat. The German [[Wehrmacht]] occupied Melitopol on 6 October 1941. Within one week the entire remaining [[Jews|Jewish]] population of Melitopol (2,000 men, women and children) were murdered by [[Einsatzgruppe|Einsatzgruppen]], which was actively supported by the Wehrmacht. The Germans operated a Nazi prison in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&tab=7&id=770|title=Gefängnis Melitopol'|website=Bundesarchiv.de|access-date=26 February 2022|language=de}}</ref>

====The Wotan Line Battle====
After breaking through on the Mius River and defeating Axis troops in the Donbas and Taganrog, the Soviet Southern Front army pursuing the retreating enemy came to the [[Molochna River]] on 22 September 1943. Here, in the basin of the Milk River, German troops had begun to build a strong long-term defence which they called the [[Panther-Wotan line]]. It was on this line that the fate of the Crimean peninsula and the whole course of offensive operations in the southern Soviet Union were decided.

The German defense consisted of four lines, covered with solid anti-tank ditches and land mines. The first attempt of the Soviet Southern Front army to break through was unsuccessful. Soviet commanders decided to prepare thoroughly a new attempt: the so-called “Melitopol operation”, which was carried out successfully from 26 September to 5 November 1943.

Fighting lasted long, as the Germans introduced fresh reserves in order to keep Melitopol. Finally, after many days of heavy street fighting against vastly superior numbers of men and equipment, German resistance was broken and on 23 October the Red Army took complete control of the city. By decrees of the [[Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet]], 87 Red soldiers and airmen were awarded the title of "Hero of the Soviet Union" for their actions in the reconquest of Melitopol.

=== Russo-Ukrainian War ===
{{update|section|date=February 2024}}
{{main|Battle of Melitopol|Russian occupation of Zaporizhzhia Oblast#History}}
During the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]], Melitopol was attacked by the Russian forces on 25 February 2022, and captured after heavy fighting by 1 March. Mayor [[Ivan Fedorov (politician)|Ivan Fedorov]] pledged non-cooperation, and locals took to the streets to protest the Russian occupation.<ref>{{cite news |title='We are not co-operating': Life in occupied Ukraine |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60670173 |access-date=23 March 2022 |work=BBC News |date=9 March 2022}}</ref> On 11 March Fedorov was abducted by the Russian military and released five days later as part of a prisoner swap.<ref name="cnn-melitopol">{{cite news |title=Melitopol mayor accuses Russians of seizing businesses in the city |url=https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-23-22/h_bbb8ed2b3b46186e9a66afb142f12c70 |access-date=23 March 2022 |publisher=CNN |date=23 March 2022 |language=en}}</ref> In the meantime, the Russian forces had attempted to install former councilor [[Halyna Danylchenko]] of the [[Opposition Bloc (2019)|Opposition Bloc]] party as acting mayor.

On 30 May, a bomb exploded in central Melitopol during a humanitarian aid transfer between local residents and Russian personnel, injuring at least three people, according to the Russian investigative committee's website which referenced "Ukrainian saboteurs" as the possible perpetrators. In a statement from exile, Ivan Fedorov alluded to the possibility that the bombing was connected to local Ukrainian resistance fighters.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bomb hits Russian-occupied Ukraine city of Melitopol - Russian, Ukraine officials |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/bomb-hits-russian-occupied-ukraine-city-melitopol-russian-ukraine-officials-2022-05-30/  |access-date=3 June 2022 |work=Reuters |date=30 May 2022}}</ref> On 30 September, in a move unrecognized internationally, the city was annexed by Russia as part of the [[Russian annexation of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts|Russian annexation of Zaporizhzhia oblast]].

Russian occupation authorities instituted a policy of re-[[Sovietization]] of the city, including restoring Soviet names to Melitopol's streets, although these names are not historical and were invented by the Bolsheviks in the 1920s.<ref>[https://www.svoboda.org/amp/okkupatsionnye-vlasti-melitopolya-vernuli-ulitsam-sovetskie-nazvaniya-/32247030.html "Оккупационные власти Мелитополя вернули улицам советские названия"]</ref>

On 27 April 2023, the police chief defector Oleksandr Mishchenko was killed in a bomb blast at his apartment block. His assassin(s) were Ukrainian partisans.<ref name="bbc27">{{cite news |last1=Greenall |first1=Robert |title=Ukraine war: Partisan attack kills police chief in Russian-occupied Melitopol |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65414836 |publisher=BBC |date=27 April 2023}}</ref>
