'''Saint-Étienne''' ({{IPA|fr|sɛ̃t‿etjɛn|-|LL-Q150 (fra)-0x010C-Saint-Étienne.wav}}; [[Franco-Provençal|Franco-Provencal]]: ''Sant-Etiève'') is a city and the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the [[Loire (department)|Loire]] [[Departments of France|département]], in eastern-central France, in the [[Massif Central]], {{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Lyon]], in the [[Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes]] [[Regions of France|region]].<ref>[https://www.insee.fr/fr/metadonnees/geographie/commune/42218-saint-etienne INSEE commune file]</ref>

Saint-Étienne is the [[List of communes in France with over 20,000 inhabitants|thirteenth most populated]] commune in France and the second most populated commune in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes. Its [[Métropole|metropolis]] (''métropole''), [[Saint-Étienne Métropole]], is the second most populous regional metropolis after [[Lyon Metropolis|Lyon]]. The commune is also at the heart of a vast [[Functional area (France)|metropolitan area]] with 406,868 inhabitants (2020),<ref>[https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/1405599?geo=AAV2020-023 Comparateur de territoire], INSEE</ref> the eighteenth largest in France by population, comprising 105 communes.<ref>[https://www.insee.fr/fr/metadonnees/cog/aire-attraction-ville/AAV2020023-saint-etienne Aire d'attraction des villes 2020 de Saint-Étienne (023)], INSEE</ref> Its inhabitants are known as ''Stéphanois'' (masculine) and ''Stéphanoises'' (feminine).

Long known as the French city of the "weapon, cycle and ribbon" and a major [[coal mining]] centre, Saint-Étienne is currently engaged in a vast [[urban renewal]] program aimed at leading the transition from the [[industrial city]] inherited from the 19th century to the "design capital" of the 21st century. This approach was recognised with the entry of Saint-Étienne into the [[Creative Cities Network|UNESCO Creative Cities network]] in 2010. The city is currently undergoing renewal, with the installation of the Châteaucreux business district, the ‘Steel’ retail complex and the manufacturing creative district.

The city is known for its football club [[AS Saint-Étienne]], which has won the [[Ligue 1]] title ten times.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Saint-Étienne}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
[[File:Saint-etienne hotel de ville.JPG|thumb|The Hôtel de Ville]]
Named after [[Saint Stephen]], the city first appears in the historical record in the Middle Ages as {{lang|fr|Saint-Étienne de Furan}} (after the [[Furan (river)|River Furan]], a tributary of the [[Loire]]). In the 13th century, it was a small borough around the church dedicated to Saint Stephen. On the upper reaches of the Furan, near the [[Way of St. James]], the [[Abbey of Valbenoîte]] had been founded by the [[Cistercians]] in 1222. In the late 15th century, it was a fortified village defended by walls built around the original nucleus.

From the 16th century, Saint-Étienne developed an arms manufacturing industry and became a market town. It was this which accounted for the town's importance, although it also became a centre for the manufacture of [[ribbons]] and [[passementerie]] starting in the 17th century.

Later, it became a mining centre of the [[Loire coal mining basin]]. The [[Hôtel de Ville, Saint-Étienne|Hôtel de Ville]] (City Hall) was completed in 1830.<ref>{{Base Mérimée|IA42000040}}</ref>

In the first half of the 19th century, it was only a chief town of an arrondissement in the ''{{Lang|fr|département}}'' of the [[Loire (department)|Loire]], with a population of 33,064 in 1832. The concentration of industry prompted these numbers to rise rapidly to 110,000 by about 1880. It was this growing importance of Saint-Étienne that led to its being made seat of the prefecture and the departmental administration on 25 July 1855, when it became the chief town in the ''{{Lang|fr|département}}'' and seat of the prefect, replacing [[Montbrison, Loire|Montbrison]], which was reduced to the status of chief town of an {{Lang|fr|arrondissement}}. Saint-Étienne absorbed the commune of Valbenoîte and several other neighbouring localities on 31 March 1855.

==Demographics==
The population data in the table and graph below refer to the commune of Saint-Étienne proper, in its geography at the given years. The commune of Saint-Étienne absorbed the former communes of Beaubrun, Montaud, Outre-Furent and Valbenoîte in 1855, ceded [[Planfoy]] in 1863, merged with the exclave Saint-Victor-sur-Loire and with Terrenoire in 1969 and Rochetaillée in 1973.<ref name=ehess/>

Saint-Étienne became a popular stop for automobile travelers in the early 20th century.

A landmark in the history of the importance ascribed to design in Saint-Étienne was the inauguration of ''La Cité du design'' on the site of the former arms factory in 2009.

The city also launched the [[Massenet Festival]]s, (the composer [[Jules Massenet]] hailed from the area) devoted mainly to perform Massenet's operas. In 2000, the city was named one of the [[French Towns and Lands of Art and History]]. On 22 November 2010, it was nominated as "City of Design" as part of [[UNESCO]]'s [[Creative Cities Network]].<ref>[https://archive.today/20120712134526/http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=41427&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html St-Etienne and Sydney nominated UNESCO Creative Cities ], 22 November 2010.</ref>
