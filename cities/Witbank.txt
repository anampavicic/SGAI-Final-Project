The city is known for its coal-mining in the surrounding region.

Witbank, which was founded in 1890, was renamed to eMalahleni meaning the ''place of coal'' in 2006 by the government of [[Mpumalanga]], matching the [[Emalahleni Local Municipality, Mpumalanga|municipality]]. Both names are used.

== <span lang="Afrikaans " dir="ltr">History</span> ==
Witbank was founded in 1890 and early attempts to exploit the [[coal]] deposits failed until the [[railway]] from [[Pretoria]] reached the area in 1894. It was proclaimed a town in 1903 and became a [[municipality]] in 1914.

There are many stories about the city and its origination but the top story would be the arrival of [[Winston Churchill]] at the nearby [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] and Delagoa Bay Colliery during his escape from Boer imprisonment in [[Pretoria]], on his way to [[Delagoa Bay]] (later Lourenço Marques, and then [[Maputo]], in [[Mozambique]]). 

Some local residents, loyal to the Crown, assisted him in hiding and making the final leg of his escape, thus gaining Witbank the consequent credit once the details of these events could be made known. The town has grown since then from a farming community into a business destination where companies such as [[Anglo American plc|Anglo American]], [[BHP]], [[Evraz]], [[Eskom]], [[Exxaro]], [[Komatsu Limited|Komatsu]], the [[Renova Group]], [[SABMiller]], and [[Xstrata]], among many others have found substantial returns on their investments.

A large number of signs to the town have already changed, but many still remain. Some landmarks bearing the name Witbank have remained, while others (such as the Witbank/eMalahleni dam) have been renamed.

Despite attempts by governing bodies to establish the use of the name, Emalahleni, for the city as well as for the district, locals still tend to call the city by its original name. Similarly to the anglicised pronunciation of [[Johannesburg]], [[South African English|English-speaking residents]] pronounce the name as “wit•bank” and not as “vit•bunk” as in the original Afrikaans pronunciation, nor as “vit•bank” as English-speaking visitors are prone to say.

In recent years, this line has been under frequent threat of collapse due to underground coal fires in disused mines in the area.

Two national highways, the [[N4 (South Africa)|N4]] from Pretoria and the [[N12 (South Africa)|N12]] from [[Johannesburg]], converge at Witbank and then continue to [[Komatipoort]], on the border of Mozambique. Together, these routes form the [[Maputo Corridor]], a strategically important alternative to the South African ports of Richards Bay and Durban on the Indian Ocean shores of the country.

== Economy ==

Witbank is in a [[coal mining]] area with more than 22 collieries in the municipal radius. There are a number of [[Fossil fuel power plant|power stations]] (such as the [[Duvha Power Station]]), as well as a steel mill (Evraz Highveld Steel and Vanadium Limited) nearby which all require coal. The farm land surrounding Witbank is fast being bought by investors, coal mining companies and real estate developers to accommodate the rapid growth of the city which is good for local businesses and residents. The region has the dirtiest air in the world due to the coal mining and plant power stations.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Goldswain |first=Zita |date=2018-11-01 |title=We have the dirtiest air in the world |url=https://witbanknews.co.za/116572/dirtiest-air-world/ |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20221022212040/https://witbanknews.co.za/116572/dirtiest-air-world/ |archive-date=2022-10-22 |access-date=2023-12-27 |website=Witbank News}}</ref>

Likewise, the sustained growth of the commercial areas and suburbs has presented significant challenges to the municipal government. Potable water supplies, sewage treatment, electricity distribution, refuse collection and road maintenance are particularly affected, arousing sustained ire amongst the local residents. Relatively high summer rainfall since 2008 has caused significant damage to municipal roads, creating large numbers of potholes and leaving large amounts of debris on the road surfaces.

== Demographics ==
The 2001 census<ref>[http://census.adrianfrith.com/place/80948 2001 census information about Witbank, including ethnic groups, languages and population]</ref>{{Dead link|date=December 2023 |fix-attempted=yes |url=}} found that Witbank had a population of 61,093, of which 50.6% were female and 49.4% male.

As of 2011 ([[Statistics South Africa]]) the city's population stood at 108,674 people.

=== Communities ===
To the west of the city, two large communities, Vosman and Kwa-Guqa (“the Place of Kneeling” in Zulu), and two smaller communities, Lynnville, Ackerville and Schoongesicht, are home to approximately 440,000 (in 2005) residents, predominantly black. While many of these residents aspire to relocate to the more spacious suburbs around the city center, generally this has only been affordable to a few thousand, due to the prices of the suburban real estate. There are now communities on the northwest side of the city that have been established at Pine Ridge (consisting predominantly of Indian residents), Klarinet and Siyanqoba. Pressure to develop the city's suburbs has been exacerbated by the gradual de-population of the surrounding colliery villages as well as the continued development of new [[coal-fired power station]]s in the area.

== Tourism ==
As Witbank is en route to travellers  from the [[Gauteng]] province to the [[Kruger National Park]], attempts have been made to capture some of the potential tourist spend. Apart from a few hotels, there are many guest houses. These vary from the utilitarian to the luxurious, and also cater for many of the business travellers visiting Witbank as well as those travelling to [[Nelspruit|Mbombela]], [[Swaziland|eSwatini]] and [[Mozambique]]. A casino complex is accessible within a few hundred meters from the [[N4 (South Africa)|N4 highway]], providing two hotels, cinemas, ten-pin bowling and restaurants as well as the traditional gambling facilities. The Highveld Mall is built immediately next to the casino and is a retail hub for locals as well as for many residents of towns in the vicinity.
