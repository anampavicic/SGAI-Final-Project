== History ==
=== Greek settlement ===
{{main| Greeks in pre-Roman Crimea}}
The first recorded settlement in the area, called '''''Kerkinitis''''' ({{lang|el|Κερκινίτις}}), was built by [[Greek colonisation|Greek colonists]] around 500 BCE. Along with the rest of the Crimea, Kerkinitis formed part of the dominions of King [[Mithridates VI Eupator]] ({{reign | 120 | 63}} BCE). The name of the modern city derives from his nickname, ''Eupator'' ('of a noble father').

=== Khanate period ===

From roughly the 7th through the 10th centuries, Yevpatoria was a [[Khazar]] settlement; its name in [[Khazar language]] was probably ''Güzliev'' (literally 'beautiful house').<ref>Brutzkus, Julius (1944). "The Khazar Origin of Ancient Kiev", Slavonic and East European Review, p. 118</ref> It was later subject to the [[Cumans]] ([[Kipchaks]]), the [[Mongols]], and the [[Crimean Khanate]]. During this period the city was called ''Kezlev'' by [[Crimean Tatars]] and ''Gözleve'' by [[Ottoman Turks]]. The Russian medieval name ''Kozlov'' is a [[Russification]] of the Crimean Tatar name. For a short period between 1478 and 1485, the city was administered by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Afterward, it became an important urban center of the [[Crimean Khanate]].

{{main|Juma-Jami Mosque}}

The 400-year-old [[Juma-Jami Mosque]] is one of the many designed by the Ottoman architect [[Mimar Sinan]]. It was built in 1552-1564. 35-metre minarets rose on the flanks of the building. The mosque was of great state significance. It was here that a ceremony of the declaration of rights of the Crimean Khans was held at their enthronement. Only after that did they go to their capital, the city of [[Bakhchysarai]].

[[File:Eupatoria 04-14 img16 Karaimskaya Street.jpg|thumb|Entrance to one of the [[Eupatorian Kenassas]]]]
{{main|Crimean Karaites|Eupatorian Kenassas}}
Yevpatoria became a residence of the spiritual ruler of the [[Crimean Karaites]], the [[Hakham#Karaite Judaism|Ḥakham]]. In this connection, a complex of two prayer houses was built under the supervision of the Rabovich brothers, in which the Renaissance and Muslim architectural styles entwined in a most unusual manner. The ensemble organically incorporates three courtyards. The entrance to it is marked by gates, built in 1900, which look like a refined triumphal arch.

=== Imperial Russian rule ===
[[File:Evpatoriyskoye shosse.jpg|thumb|Soviet-era road sign on P25 road in [[Crimea]]]]

In 1783, along with the rest of Crimea, Kezlev was captured by the [[Russian Empire]]. Its name was officially changed to ''Yevpatoriya'' in 1784. This spelling of the city name came to the French, German, Spanish, and English languages at the end of the 18th сentury.

Polish poet [[Adam Mickiewicz]] visited the town in 1825 and wrote one of his ''[[Crimean Sonnets]]'' here; it was later translated into Russian by [[Mikhail Lermontov]].

The city was occupied in September 1854 by British, French and Turkish troops during the [[Crimean War]] prior to the Allied landing in Kalamita Bay, after which the Battle of the Alma south of the bay followed. It became a [[garrison]] of Ottoman troops later during the war and was the site of the [[Battle of Eupatoria]] in February 1855, which was the largest military clash in the Crimean theatre outside the [[Sevastopol]] area.

=== Soviet rule ===
[[File:Jugadušš (šarko) Moinaki limaani kõrgsoolase veega..jpg|thumb|220px|Hydro-massage on Lake Moynaki]]
Natural factors at Yevpatoria created beneficial conditions for the treatment of osteoarticular [[tuberculosis]] and other children's diseases; in 1933, at a scientific conference in Yalta, it was agreed that among Soviet [[resort town]]s for the organization of children's resorts, most people approved Yevpatoria. In 1936, the [[Government of the USSR|Soviet government]] placed the All-Union children's resort in Yevpatoria. In 1938, the approved plan of a general reconstruction of the city.

During World War II, [[sanatorium]]s were used as [[military hospital]]s. By 1 July 1945, Yevpatoria operated 14 sanatoriums, and have taken 2,885 people. By the 1980s, the city operated 78 sanatoriums for 33 thousand people.

=== Independent Ukraine and Russian annexation ===
{{update|section|date=January 2024}}
On 24 December 2008, a blast [[2008 Yevpatoria gas explosion|destroyed a five-story building]] in the town. 27 people were killed. [[President of Ukraine]] [[Viktor Yushchenko]] declared 26 December to be a day of national mourning.<ref>[http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/171479.html UPDATE: 26 Killed, 5 Hospitalized After Crimea House Blast]{{Dead link|date=March 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Ukrainian News Agency (26 December 2008)</ref><ref>[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/3910/ Death toll of Crimean blast reaches 27, says Emergencies Ministry] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229010006/http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/3910/ |date=2008-12-29 }}, [[Interfax|Interfax-Ukraine]] (26 December 2008)</ref><ref>[http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/171480.html Friday Declared Mourning Day In Ukraine For Victims Of Yevpatoriya Gas Explosion] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120913213556/http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/171480.html |date=2012-09-13 }}, Ukrainian News Agency (26 December 2008)</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7799935.stm Ukraine mourns Crimea blast dead], [[BBC News]] (26 December 2008)</ref><ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/12/26/ukraine.explosions.death.toll/ 27 dead after Ukrainian apartment blast], [[CNN]] (26 December 2008)</ref>

Two beaches in Yevpatoria have been [[Blue Flag beach]]es since May 2010, these were the first beaches (with two beaches in [[Yalta]]) to be awarded a Blue Flag in a [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] member state.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/66482/ Four beaches in Crimea receive international certificates of cleanliness], [[Kyiv Post]] (12 May 2010)</ref>

In 2014 due to the military operation of the [[Russian Armed Forces|Russian Armed forces]], the city of Yevpatoria was occupied by [[Russia]] along with the entire Crimean peninsula. The UN General Assembly condemned the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russian operation and considered the annexation]] ''the temporary occupation of part of the territory of Ukraine—the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/71/205|title=A/RES/71/205 – E – A/RES/71/205|website=undocs.org}}</ref>

Today, Yevpatoria is a major [[Black Sea]] port, a rail hub, and a resort town. The main industries of the city include [[fishing]], [[food processing]], winemaking, [[limestone]] [[quarry]]ing, weaving, [[manufacturing]], machinery, furniture manufacturing, and [[tourism]].

Yevpatoria has spas of mineral water, salt, and mud lakes. These resorts belong to a vast area with curative facilities where the main health-improving factors are the sunshine and sea, air and sand, brine and mud of the salt lakes, as well as the mineral water of the hot springs. The curative qualities of the local mud was witnessed by the manuscripts of [[Pliny the Elder]], a Roman scholar ({{Circa|80 BC}}).

==Names of asteroid number 6489 and number 24648==
Asteroid number 6489 has the name Golevka, which has a complicated origin. In 1995, Golevka was studied simultaneously by three [[radar]] observatories across the world: [[Goldstone Observatory|Goldstone]] in [[California]], [[Yevpatoria RT-70 radio telescope|Eupatoria RT-70 radio telescope]] (Yevpatoriya is sometimes [[Romanization of Russian|romanized]] as '''Evpatoria''' or '''Eupatoria''' ([[Romanization of Russian|Russian origin]]), and [[Kashima Space Communication Center|Kashima]] in [[Japan]]. ''''Gol-Ev-Ka'''' comes from the first few letters of each observatory's name; it was proposed by the discoverer following a suggestion by [[Alexander L. Zaitsev]].

Asteroid [[24648 Evpatoria]] was discovered 1985 Sept. 19 by [[Nikolai Chernykh]] and [[Lyudmila Chernykh]] at the [[Crimean Astrophysical Observatory]], and named in honor of Evpatoria (transliteration from Russian to English, thus Yevpatoriya). The minor planet marked the occasion of the 2500th anniversary of the town in 2003.<ref>[http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=24648+Evpatoria JPL Small-Body Database], [[NASA]]</ref>
