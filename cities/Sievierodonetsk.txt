It is located to the northeast of the left bank of the [[Donets]] river and approximately {{cvt|110|km|mi}} to the northwest from the administrative center of the oblast, [[Luhansk]]. Sievierodonetsk faces neighbouring [[Lysychansk]] across the river. The city, whose name comes from the above-mentioned river, had a population of {{Ua-pop-est2022|99,067|punct=,}} making it then the second-most populous city in the oblast. Since June 2022, it has been militarily occupied and administered by [[Russia]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title=Russian, LPR forces liberate Severodonetsk - Russian top brass - Military & Defense - TASS |url=https://tass.com/defense/1471389 |access-date=2022-06-26 |website=tass.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Ukrainian forces withdrawing from key city in Donbas mostly under Russian control |url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ukrainian-forces-withdrawing-from-key-city-of-severodonetsk-in-donbas-mostly-under-russian-control |date=2022-01-06|access-date=2023-01-05}}</ref>

Prior to the war, Sievierodonetsk had several factories as well as the [[Azot (Sievierodonetsk)|Azot]] chemical plant.

Sievierodonetsk served as the administrative centre of Luhansk Oblast from 2014 to 2022, due to the city of [[Luhansk]] falling under the control of pro-Russian separatists at the start of the [[War in Donbas (2014–2022)|war in Donbas]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://mw.ua/UKRAINE/kikhtenko-to-move-donetsk-administration-to-kramatorsk-and-to-leave-power-structures-in-mariupol-119_.html |publisher=Dzerkalo Tyzhnia media |title=Kikhtenko to move Donetsk administration to Kramatorsk and to leave power structures in Mariupol}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/31372.html |publisher=President of Ukraine, official website |title=In Severodonetsk, Petro Poroshenko presented Luhansk RSA Head Hennadiy Moskal |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318021609/http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/31372.html |archive-date=2015-03-18}}</ref> During the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]], Sievierodonetsk came [[Battle of Sievierodonetsk (2022)|under heavy attack]] from Russian forces and was the forefront of the [[Battle of Donbas (2022)|battle of Donbas]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ponomarenko |first=Illia |author-link=Illia Ponomarenko |date=7 May 2022 |title=Russia's offensive in Donbas bogs down |url=https://kyivindependent.com/national/russias-offensive-in-donbas-bogs-down/ |access-date=13 May 2022 |website=[[The Kyiv Independent]]}}</ref> resulting in extensive destruction to the city, including residential areas.<ref>[https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-06-08/satellite-images-of-destruction-in-sievierodonetsk-ukraine/101133912 "Satellite images show scale of destruction in Ukrainian industrial city of Sievierodonetsk"], ABC Net, 8 June 2022</ref> By 25 June 2022, the city was fully captured by Russian and separatist forces,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/25/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-06-25-intl/index.html | title=Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk now 'completely under Russian occupation' after months of fighting | website=[[CNN]] | date=25 June 2022 }}</ref> with Ukrainian authorities claiming that the civilian population was approximately 10,000, or ten percent of its pre-war population.<ref name=kyivind20220630>{{cite news |title=As Ukraine withdraws from Sievierodonetsk, Battle of Donbas enters next phase |url=https://kyivindependent.com/national/as-ukraine-withdraws-from-sievierodonetsk-battle-of-donbas-enters-next-phase |last=Ponomarenko|first=Illia |work=[[Kyiv Independent]] |date=30 June 2022 |access-date=2 July 2022 }}</ref>

== Toponymy ==
According to one of the versions, the city got its name from the Donets. Based on the [[Russian language|Russian]] name of the river ({{lang|ru|Сѣверный Донецъ}}, {{Abbr|{{sc|m}}|Modern orthography}}: {{lang|ru|Северский Донець}}), the name of the city in Russian is ''Severodonetsk''.{{efn|{{lang|ru|Северодоне́цк}}, {{IPA|ru|ˌsʲevʲɪrədɐˈnʲetsk|IPA}}}} According to another version, the name comes from the location of the city, which is situated to the north of the Donets bank.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sed-rada.gov.ua/novini-mista/sessiya-gorodskogo-soveta-bez-sveta-no-rezultativno_27-01-2017 |access-date=2021-01-17 |website=Official site of the city council |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210422175257/https://sed-rada.gov.ua/novini-mista/sessiya-gorodskogo-soveta-bez-sveta-no-rezultativno_27-01-2017 |archive-date=2021-04-22 |script-title=ru:Сессия городского совета: без света, но результативно}}</ref>

The Ukrainian name of the city has a rather complicated history. The decree of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] dated 27 January 1950, "On the renaming of the [[urban-type settlement]] Lyskhimstroi of the Lysychansk Raion of the Voroshilovgrad Oblast" was issued in Russian, and the name of the city was indicated as ''Severodonetsk'', which was later translated into [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] as ''S'''ie'''v'''ie'''rodonetsk''.{{efn|{{lang|uk|Сєвєродоне́цьк}}, {{IPA|uk|ˌsʲɛwʲerodoˈnɛtsʲk|IPA|Uk-Сєвєродонецьк.ogg}}}} However, this spelling is erroneous in the Ukrainian language, and the spelling of the city's name in many sources (dictionaries, maps, and official documents) has been corrected, but it has not been fixed at the official level. At the same time, the name ''S'''ie'''v'''e'''rodonetsk''{{efn|{{lang|uk|Сєверодонецьк}}, {{IPA|uk|ˌsʲɛwerodoˈnɛtsʲk|IPA}}}} was used in the notification about the assignment of the settlement to the category of cities of district significance.<ref>Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, 1958, №&nbsp;3, p. 68</ref>

According to the spelling of 1993 (in Section 108), the name of the city is ''Siverskodonetsk'',<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://izbornyk.org.ua/pravopys/rozdil4.htm |title=IV.

Concurrently, the official name was ''Sieverodonetsk'', which would be fair if it applied to a city in Russia, instead, the rule regarding the transliteration of the Russian language into Ukrainian, was illegally applied to a city in Ukraine itself. In the [[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]], the main name of the city is ''Siverskodonetske'', while other spellings are ''Sieverodonetske'' and ''Pivnichnodonetske''.

In the normative-legal document "[[Classification of objects of the administrative-territorial system of Ukraine]]", the city was classified as ''S'''i'''v'''e'''rodonetsk'', and the aforesaid name was used in other official documents in recent years. Until mid-1990, the spelling ''Sieverodonetsk'' prevailed on the signs of institutions in the city itself, but ''Severodonetsk'' and ''Sievierodonetsk'' were also used.

On 3 April 2024, the {{ill|Committee on the Organization of State Power, Local Self-government, Regional Development, and Urban Planning|uk|Комітет Верховної Ради України з питань організації державної влади, місцевого самоврядування, регіонального розвитку та містобудування}} in the [[Verkhovna Rada]] stated their support for renaming the city to ''Siverskodonetsk'' ({{lang|uk|Сіверськодонецьк}}).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rada.gov.ua/news/news_kom/248109.html |title=Комітет з питань організації державної влади підтримав перейменування низки населених пунктів, назви яких містять символіку російської імперської політики або не відповідають стандартам державної мови |date=April 4, 2024 |lang=uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hromadske.ua/posts/u-radi-pidtrimali-perejmenuvannya-syevyerodonecka-krasnograda-ta-she-50-mist-i-selish|title=У Раді підтримали перейменування Сєвєродонецька, Краснограда та ще 50 міст і селищ|date=2024-04-03|website=hromadske.ua|language=uk|access-date=2024-04-05}}</ref> The name was finally approved by the Verkhovna Rada on 19 September 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |title= |script-title=uk:Проект Постанови про перейменування окремих населених пунктів та районів |trans-title=Draft resolution on renaming individual populated places and raions |url=https://itd.rada.gov.ua/billInfo/Bills/Card/44913 |archive-url= |access-date=2024-09-19}}</ref>

==History==

=== Foundation and the Soviet era ===
The foundation of modern Sievierodonetsk is closely connected with the beginning of construction of the Lysychansk Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant within the limits of [[Lysychansk]], [[Donetsk Oblast|Donetsian Oblast]], [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]], [[Soviet Union]] in 1934. Donets itself was already combined with Lysychansk.{{cn|date=March 2023}} The first settlement of workers on the construction site was called ''Lyskhimstroi'' ({{Langx|uk|Лисхімстрої}}, {{Langx|ru|Лисхимстрой}}), near Donets. In September 1935, the first school was opened in the settlement, a silicate brick plant started production, and the first three residential two-story houses were built. In 1940, there were 47 houses, a school, a club, a kindergarten, a nursery, and 10 buildings of a chemical combine in Lyskhimstroi.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

During the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Second World War]], Lyskhimstroi and surrounding areas were occupied by [[Wehrmacht|German forces]] on 11 July 1942. On 1 February 1943 it was retaken by the [[41st Guards Rifle Division]] and 110th Tank Brigade of the [[Red Army]]. Work to restore and expand the Lysychansk Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant began on 10 December 1943 and by 1946, the pre-war housing stock was completely restored, which amounted to 17,000 square meters.{{cn|date=March 2023}} An [[Sievierodonetsk Airport|airfield]] south of the Lyskhimstroi began operations in May 1948; it underwent major renovations during the early 1960s.

Four new names were proposed for the settlement in 1950: Svetlograd, Komsomolsk-on-Donets, Mendeleevsk and Severodonetsk. It was ultimately renamed the latter, after the Seversky Donets. Severodonetsk would receive the status of an urban settlement the same year. On 1 January 1951, the Lysychansk Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant would produce its first output of ammonium nitrate.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ukrainetrek.com/severodonetsk-city/ |title=Severodonetsk city, Ukraine trek |website=ukrainetrek.com |access-date=2019-05-16 |archive-date=2019-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417092238/http://ukrainetrek.com/severodonetsk-city |url-status=dead }}</ref>

A local newspaper named ''The Communist Way'' ({{Langx|uk|{{em|Комуністичний шлях}}}}, {{Langx|ru|{{em|Коммунистический путь}}}}), later renamed ''Severodonetsk News'' ({{Langx|uk|{{em|Сєвєродонецькі вісті}}}}, {{Langx|ru|{{em|Северодонецкие вести}}}}), was published in the city from 2 April 1965 to early 2019.<ref>№ 2910.
