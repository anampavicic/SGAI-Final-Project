'''Vellore''' (English: {{respell|VAY|loor}}), also natively spelt as '''Velur''',{{refn|group=note|''Vellore'' is the [[British English]] spelling, and ''Vēlūr'' (({{IPA-ta|ʋeːluːɾ|lang}})) is the [[ISO 15919|romanized]] spelling from [[Tamil script]].}} is a sprawling city and the administrative headquarters of [[Vellore district]] in the Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. It is located on the banks of the [[Palar River]] in the northeastern part of [[Tamil Nadu]] and is separated into four zones that are further subdivided into 60 wards, covering an area of 76.09 &nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and housing a population of 315128 as reported by the 2011 census.<ref>https://www.tnurbantree.tn.gov.in/vellore/</ref> It is located about {{convert|137.20|km|mi|0|abbr=}} west of [[Chennai]], and about {{convert|213.20|km|mi|0|abbr=}} east of [[Bangalore]]. Vellore is located on the [[Mumbai]]–Chennai arm of the [[Golden Quadrilateral]]. Vellore is governed under a [[mayor]] and the [[Vellore Municipal Corporation]]. It is a part of both the [[Vellore (Lok Sabha constituency)|Lok Sabha]] and [[Vellore (State Assembly Constituency)|state assembly]] constituencies of Vellore.

Vellore is the home to the [[Christian Medical College & Hospital]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/CMC-exhibition-focuses-on-pregnancy-and-diabetes/article16443529.ece|title=CMC exhibition focuses on pregnancy and diabetes|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-02-26|language=en}}</ref> the [[Vellore Institute of Technology|Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT)]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://vit.ac.in/ |title=Home |website=vit.ac.in}}</ref> and the [[Golden Temple, Sripuram|Sripuram Golden Temple.]]

The Vellore region is the largest exporter of finished [[leather]] goods in the country. Leather exports from Vellore account for more than 37% of India's leather exports and leather-related products.<ref name=VDA1>{{cite web|title=Activities and schemes operated by District Industries Centre, Vellore district|url=http://vellore.nic.in/dic.htm|publisher=Vellore District Administration |access-date=2013-07-07}}</ref>

Vellore is one of 27 cities chosen by the&nbsp;Government of India to take part in the country's [[Smart Cities Mission]].

Oxford Economics Global Cities Index 2024 ranked Vellore as 24th Best City in India and 729th best city in the world <ref>{{Cite web |title=Global Cities Index |url=https://www.oxfordeconomics.com/global-cities-index/ |access-date=2024-08-12 |website=Oxford Economics |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Etymology==
According to a legend, many [[Vachellia nilotica|babul trees]] (known locally as '''velan''' trees) surrounded this region, which led to the name 'Vellore'.<ref name="urbaninfra12" />

Vellore is also known as the Second Madras because of its importance and location relative to [[Chennai]] (Madras).

==History==
The recorded history of Vellore dates back to the ninth century, as seen from a [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] inscription in the [[Annamalaiyar Temple]] in [[Tiruvannamalai]].<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://municipality.tn.gov.in/thiruvannamalai/abcity_Historical%20Moments.htm|title=Tiruvannamali Historical moments|year=2011|access-date=2012-12-29|publisher=Tiruvannamali Municipality|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191523/http://municipality.tn.gov.in/thiruvannamalai/abcity_Historical%20Moments.htm|archive-date=2013-10-29}}</ref>

Vellore is strategically located<!--How so?--> and well-connected by rail and bus routes to major towns in the neighbouring states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Kerala]]. Many dynasties and rulers dominated Vellore throughout its history, including the [[Pallava dynasty]], [[Medieval Cholas]], [[Later Cholas]], the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty]], the [[Sambuvaraya|Sambuvaraya chieftains]], [[Vijayanagar]], the [[Nawabs of the Carnatic]], and the administration of the [[British Raj|British]]. In the 18th century, Vellore was involved in the [[Carnatic Wars]] between Britain and France. It was situated close to several decisive battles, including those at [[Ambur]] (1749), [[Arcot]] (1751), and [[Vandavasi]] (1760). During the first half of the 19th century, the town came under [[British rule in India|British rule]].<ref name="urbaninfra12">[[#urban|Urban Infrastructure Report]] 2008, p. 12</ref>

[[File:Thomas Daniell (1749-1840) - The Fort of Vellore in the Carnatic, India - 732241 - National Trust.jpg|thumb|Thomas Daniell (1749-1840)- The Fort of Vellore in the Carnatic, India]]

[[Vellore Fort]] is important to Vellore's history. Due to a lack of historical records, it is not known exactly when the fort was constructed, but estimates based on stone inscriptions suggests that the fort was most likely built during the rule of Chinna Bommi Nayak between 1526 and 1595. The fort is a good example of [[Architecture of Tamil Nadu|Tamil Nadu military architecture]], while the [[Jalakandeswarar Temple, Vellore|Jalakandeswarar Temple]] within the fort represents [[Vijayanagara architecture]].

[[Christian Medical College & Hospital, Vellore|Christian Medical College & Hospital]], founded in 1900 by the American medical missionary [[Ida S. Scudder|Dr. Ida S. Scudder]], is another Vellore landmark. The hospital has grown into a medical institution of international repute.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Murthi |first=P. V.

The central prison in Vellore, established in 1830, had imprisoned notable Indian independence activists like [[C. Rajagopalachari]] and [[Ramaswamy Venkataraman]]. Other landmarks include the Aruganthampoodi mausoleums, located close to the section of [[National Highway 48 (India)|National Highway 48]] between Vellore and Arcot, where the family members of [[Tipu Sultan]] were buried; and the Muthu Mandapam, a memorial on the banks of [[Palar River]] built by the Tamil Nadu Government to honor [[Sri Vikrama Rajasinha]], the last ruler of the [[Kingdom of Kandy]] in [[Sri Lanka]], who ruled from 1798 to 1815 and was imprisoned in Vellore Fort for 17 years until his death.

===Vellore Fort===
{{Main|Vellore Fort}}

The fort of Vellore was built around 1566 CE by the chieftains of Sadashiv Raya of the Vijayanagara Empire. In the mid-17th century the fort was owned by various parties. The Aravidus, the last dynasty that ruled Vijayanagara lost Vellore to the Bijapur Sultan before being captured by the Marathas after a siege that lasted four and a half months in 1676. The fort came under the charge of Dost Ali, the Nawab of Carnatic, before passing on to the British in 1760. Vellore Fort withstood Hyder Ali's siege from 1780 to 1782, and would later become the base for Lord Cornwallis’ march on Bangalore to defeat Tipu Sultan.

When Tipu Sultan was killed at Sringapatam during the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] (1798-79 CE), his kingdom was handed back to the Hindu Wodeyar kings of Mysore and the British exiled Tipu's surviving sons, daughters, their families, and their entire entourage to Vellore Fort. They stayed in the palaces in the fort and participated in the mutiny of 1806.

===Vellore mutiny===
{{Main|Vellore Mutiny}}

In 1805, the new Commander-in-Chief of the [[Madras Army]] of the [[East India Company|British East India Company]], [[John Cradock, 1st Baron Howden|General Sir John Cradock]], began an ambitious reform of the army's disciplinary system. New, standardized regulations were approved for the Madras Army, which dictated how [[sepoy]]s should wear their uniforms and appear on duty. Under these regulations, Hindus were prohibited from wearing religious marks on their foreheads while on duty, and Muslims were required to shave their beards and trim their moustaches. One change that was especially problematic was a new headdress associated with Indian converts to Christianity, which included a leather [[cockade]]. This caused an uproar, as leather was a cultural taboo for the upper caste sepoys of the Madras Army. As a result, many sepoys believed that their British officers were conspiring to convert them to Christianity.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

In May 1806, a few soldiers protested against these changes and were sent to [[Fort St. George, India|Fort St. George]] in Chennai, where they were publicly lashed and discharged from the army. With the levels of resentment towards the British already high, the sons of the deceased [[Tipu Sultan]] exacerbated the conflict by assisting the mutineers who revolted on 10 July. Under the pretense of attending the wedding of one of Tipu Sultan's daughters, mutineers gathered in Vellore Fort where the wedding was held and revolted. Raising the flag of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], they declared Tipu Sultan's son Fateh Hyder king. The mutineers inflicted about 200 casualties before their revolt was put down by reinforcements under the command of [[Robert Rollo Gillespie|Sir Hugh Robert Rollo Gillespie]]; many of the mutineers were captured and summarily executed or court-martialed.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

As a result of the uprising, the dress codes were retracted, and Cradock was dismissed. Although the mutiny took place before larger revolts in the 1850s, it was indicative of the simmering dissent in the Indian soldiery. The Vellore mutiny is considered to be the first large-scale Indian mutiny against the British, and a prelude to the much larger [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Sepoy Mutiny]] in 1857.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

In the 1930s, a series of [[Vellore riots of 1930–1931|communal riots]] ocurred between [[Hindu|Hindus]] and [[Muslim|Muslims]].<ref>{{cite book |author-last=More |author-first=J. B. Prashant |title=The Political Evolution of Muslims in Tamilnadu and Madras, 1930–1947 |date=1997 |publisher=Orient Longman |pages=94–95}}</ref>

==Economic, social and cultural changes in the 20th century==
The economic condition of the district in the earlier stages was not sound with the absence of major industries. Industries like [[Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited]] in Ranipet and the [[Tamil Nadu Industrial Explosives Limited]], and the locality of [[Katpadi]] were established as the result of government policy. There has been notable growth of small scale industries and tanneries in the district, which has generated employment opportunities and benefitted farmers. [[Uzhavar Santhai]] is a useful market window for farmers. Women-driven self help groups have played an important role in building the rural economy and teaching [[rural women]] to be self-reliant. Vellore has also seen a period of upward social growth with improvement in literacy and the local economy. Literacy improved in part due to the Arivoli Movement.

==Geography and climate==
