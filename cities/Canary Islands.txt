The '''Canary Islands''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|n|ɛər|i}}, {{langx|es|[[:es:Canarias|Canarias]]}}, {{IPA|es|kaˈnaɾjas|lang}}), also known informally as '''the Canaries''', are a Spanish region, [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] and [[archipelago]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. At their closest point to the African mainland, they are {{convert|100|km|abbr=off}} west of [[Morocco]] and the [[Western Sahara]]. They are the southernmost of the [[autonomous communities of Spain]].

The seven main islands are, from largest to smallest in area, [[Tenerife]], [[Fuerteventura]], [[Gran Canaria]], [[Lanzarote]], [[La Palma]], [[La Gomera]], and [[El Hierro]]. The only other populated island is [[Graciosa, Canary Islands|La Graciosa]], which administratively is dependent on Lanzarote. The archipelago includes many smaller islands and islets, including [[Alegranza]], [[Islote de Lobos|Isla de Lobos]], [[Montaña Clara]], [[Roque del Oeste]], and [[Roque del Este]]. It includes a number of rocks, including [[Roque de Garachico|Garachico]] and [[Roques de Anaga|Anaga]].

== Etymology ==
The name ''Islas Canarias'' is likely derived from the Latin name ''Canariae Insulae'', meaning "Islands of the Dogs", perhaps because monk seals or sea dogs were abundant, a name that was evidently generalized from the ancient name of one of these islands, ''Canaria'' – presumably Gran Canaria. According to the historian [[Pliny the Elder]], the island ''Canaria'' contained "vast multitudes of dogs of very large size".<ref>Pliny the Elder, ''The Natural History'', [http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=PerseusLatinTexts&getid=1&query=Plin.%20Nat.%206.37 Book 6, Chap. 37. (32.)] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190429031139/http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=PerseusLatinTexts&getid=1&query=Plin.%20Nat.%206.37 |date=29 April 2019 }} —The Fortunate Islands</ref> The connection to dogs is retained in their depiction on the islands' coat-of-arms.

Other theories speculate that the name comes from the [[Nukkari]] Berber tribe living in the Moroccan Atlas, named in Roman sources as ''Canarii'', though Pliny again mentions the relation of this term with dogs.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Pliny the Elder |author-link=Pliny the Elder |title=The Natural History |title-link=Natural History (Pliny) |volume=5 An account of countries, nations, seas, towns, havens, mountains, rivers, distances, and peoples who now exist or formerly existed |chapter=1 The Two Mauritanias |chapter-url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137:book=5:chapter=1 |access-date=13 January 2023 |via=perseus.tufts.edu |translator=John Bostock |date=1855 |orig-date=77 CE |place=London |publisher=Taylor and Francis }}</ref>

The name of the islands is not derived from the [[Atlantic Canary|canary bird]]; rather, the birds are named after the islands.

== Islands ==
From west to east, the Canary Islands are [[El Hierro]], [[La Palma]], [[La Gomera]], [[Tenerife]], [[Gran Canaria]], [[Fuerteventura]], [[Lanzarote]], and [[Graciosa, Canary Islands|La Graciosa]]. North of Lanzarote are the islets of [[Montaña Clara]], [[Alegranza]], [[Roque del Este]] and [[Roque del Oeste]], belonging to the [[Chinijo Archipelago]]. Northeast of Fuerteventura is the islet of [[Lobos Island|Lobos]]. There are a series of small adjacent rocks in the Canary Islands: the [[Roques de Anaga]], [[Roque de Garachico|Garachico]] and Fasnia in Tenerife, and Salmor and Bonanza in El Hierro.

=== La Graciosa ===
{{main|La Graciosa}}

Graciosa Island or commonly La Graciosa is a volcanic island in the Canary Islands of Spain, located {{cvt|2|km|mi}} north of the island of Lanzarote across the Strait of El Río. It was formed by the Canary hotspot. The island is part of the Chinijo Archipelago and the Chinijo Archipelago Natural Park (Parque Natural del Archipiélago Chinijo). It is administered by the municipality of Teguise. In 2018, La Graciosa was declared as ''the eighth Canary Island'' by the [[Spanish Senate]],<ref name="Monzón2019">{{cite news |author1=Agustín Monzón |date=26 June 2018 |title=La Graciosa se convierte en la octava isla de Canarias |url=https://www.elindependiente.com/politica/2018/06/26/graciosa-convierte-octava-isla-canarias/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416090007/https://www.elindependiente.com/politica/2018/06/26/graciosa-convierte-octava-isla-canarias/ |archive-date=16 April 2019 |access-date=3 December 2019 |work=El Independiente |language=es }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last1=Morris |first1=Hugh |date=28 June 2018 |title=Nine fascinating facts about the newest Canary Island |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/canary-islands/lanzarote/articles/la-graciosa-why-visit-facts/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191204010003/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/canary-islands/lanzarote/articles/la-graciosa-why-visit-facts/ |archive-date=4 December 2019 |access-date=3 December 2019 |website=The Telegraph |language=en-GB }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=26 June 2018 |title=El Senado reconoce a La Graciosa como la octava isla canaria habitada |url=https://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20180626/45418824885/el-senado-reconoce-a-la-graciosa-como-la-octava-isla-canaria-habitada.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200428115825/https://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20180626/45418824885/el-senado-reconoce-a-la-graciosa-como-la-octava-isla-canaria-habitada.html |archive-date=28 April 2020 |access-date=3 December 2019 |website=La Vanguardia |language=es }}</ref> though it is not recognized as such by the Canarian administration.

[[Tenerife]] is the largest and most populous island of the archipelago. [[Gran Canaria]], with 865,070 inhabitants, is both the Canary Islands' second most populous island, and the third most populous one in Spain after Tenerife (966,354 inhabitants) and [[Majorca]] (896,038 inhabitants).{{citation needed|date=February 2024}} The island of [[Fuerteventura]] is the second largest in the archipelago and located {{cvt|100|km}} from the African coast.

The islands form the [[Macaronesia]] [[ecoregion]] with the [[Azores]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Madeira Islands|Madeira]], and the [[Savage Isles]].<ref>{{Citation |last1=Carracedo |first1=Juan Carlos |title=North-East Atlantic Islands: The Macaronesian Archipelagos |date=1 January 2021 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780081029084000278 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geology (Second Edition) |pages=674–699 |editor-last=Alderton |editor-first=David |place=Oxford |publisher=Academic Press |language=en |isbn=978-0-08-102909-1 |access-date=3 July 2022 |last2=Troll |first2=Valentin R. |editor2-last=Elias |editor2-first=Scott A. |archive-date=21 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210121212110/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780081029084000278 |url-status=live }}</ref> The Canary Islands is the largest and most populated archipelago of the Macaronesia region.<ref name="catalogo.museosdetenerife.org"/> The archipelago has seven large and several smaller islands, all of which are volcanic in origin.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Canary Islands Hot Spot |author=José Mangas Viñuela |date=2007 |url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/Canary.html |access-date=13 January 2023 |website=www.mantleplumes.org |archive-date=19 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230319070848/http://www.mantleplumes.org/Canary.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

According to the position of the islands with respect to the north-east [[trade winds]], the climate can be mild and wet or very dry. Several native species form [[laurisilva]] forests.

The individual islands in the Canary archipelago tend to have distinct [[microclimate]]s. Those islands such as [[El Hierro]], [[La Palma]] and [[La Gomera]] lying to the west of the archipelago have a climate which is influenced by the moist [[Canary Current]]. They are well vegetated even at low levels and have extensive tracts of sub-tropical laurisilva forest. Travelling east toward the African coast, the influence of the current diminishes, and the islands become increasingly arid. [[Fuerteventura]] and [[Lanzarote]], the islands which are closest to the African mainland, are effectively desert or semi-desert.

[[Gran Canaria]] is known as a "continent in miniature" for its diverse landscapes like [[Maspalomas]] and [[Roque Nublo]]. The north of [[Tenerife]] lies under the influence of the moist Atlantic winds and is well vegetated. The south of the island around the tourist resorts of [[Playa de las Américas]] and [[Los Cristianos]] is arid. The island rises to almost {{cvt|4000|m}} above sea level. At altitude, in the cool relatively wet climate, forests of the endemic pine ''[[Pinus canariensis]]'' thrive. Many of the plant species in the Canary Islands, like the Canary Island pine and the [[Dracaena (plant)|dragon tree]], ''[[Dracaena draco]]'' are endemic, as noted by [[Sabin Berthelot]] and [[Philip Barker Webb]] in their work, ''L'Histoire Naturelle des Îles Canaries'' (1835–50).<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Webb |first1=Philip Barker |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/60795 |title=Histoire naturelle des Iles Canaries |last2=Berthelot |first2=Sabin |last3=Oudart |first3=P.

=== Climate ===

The regional executive body, the [[Parliament of the Canary Islands]], is presided over by [[Fernando Clavijo Batlle]] ([[Canarian Coalition]]), the current [[President of the Canary Islands]]. The members of the regional legislature, the [[Parliament of the Canary Islands]], has 70 elected legislators. The [[2023 Canarian regional election|last regional election]] took place in May 2023.

The islands have 14 seats in the [[Senate of Spain|Spanish Senate]]. Of these, 11 seats are directly elected, 3 for Gran Canaria, 3 for Tenerife, and 1 each for Lanzarote (including La Graciosa), Fuerteventura, La Palma, La Gomera and El Hierro.

The social structure of indigenous Canarians encompassed "a system of [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] descent in most of the islands, in which inheritance was passed on via the female line. Social status and wealth were hereditary and determined the individual's position in the social pyramid, which consisted of the king, the relatives of the king, the lower nobility, villeins, plebeians, and finally executioners, butchers, embalmers, and prisoners". Their religion was [[Animism|animist]], centring on the sun and moon, as well as natural features such as mountains.<ref name=":4" />

===Exploration===

The islands may have been visited by the [[Phoenicia]]ns, the [[Greeks]], and the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]]. King [[Juba II]], Caesar [[Augustus]]'s [[Numidia]]n protégé, is credited with discovering the islands for the Western world.

From the 14th&nbsp;century onward, numerous visits were made by sailors from [[Majorca]], [[Portugal]], and [[Genoa]]. [[Lancelotto Malocello]] settled on Lanzarote in 1312. The Majorcans established a [[missionary|mission]] with a bishop in the islands that lasted from 1350 to 1400.

=== Castilian conquest ===
{{Main|Conquest of the Canary Islands|Kingdom of the Canary Islands|Crown of Castile|Kingdom of Portugal}}
In 1402, the Castilian colonisation of the islands began with the expedition of the French explorers [[Jean de Béthencourt]] and [[Gadifer de la Salle]], nobles and [[vassal]]s of [[Henry III of Castile]], to Lanzarote. From there, they went on to conquer Fuerteventura (1405) and El Hierro. These invasions were "brutal cultural and military clashes between the indigenous population and the Castilians" lasting over a century due to formidable resistance by indigenous Canarians.<ref name=":3" /> Professor [[Mohamed Adhikari]] has defined the conquest of the islands as a [[genocide]] of the [[Guanches]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Adhikari |first1=Mohamed |date=7 September 2017 |title=Europe's First Settler Colonial Incursion into Africa: The Genocide of Aboriginal Canary Islanders |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17532523.2017.1336863 |journal=African Historical Review |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=1–26 |doi=10.1080/17532523.2017.1336863 |s2cid=165086773 |access-date=6 March 2022 |archive-date=3 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220503122719/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17532523.2017.1336863 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Adhikari |first=Mohamed |date=25 July 2022 |title=Destroying to Replace: Settler Genocides of Indigenous Peoples |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ht9dEAAAQBAJ |location=Indianapolis |publisher=Hackett Publishing |pages=1–32 |isbn=978-1647920548 |access-date=21 March 2023 |archive-date=26 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326164810/https://books.google.com/books?id=ht9dEAAAQBAJ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Béthencourt received the title King of the Canary Islands, but still recognised King Henry III as his overlord. It was not a simple military enterprise, given the aboriginal resistance on some islands. Neither was it politically, since the particular interests of the nobility (determined to strengthen their economic and political power through the acquisition of the islands) conflicted with those of the states, particularly Castile, which were in the midst of territorial expansion and in a process of strengthening of the crown against the nobility.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mercer |first=John |title=The Canary Islanders: Their Prehistory, Conquest, and Survival |date=1980}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2024}}

[[File:AlonsoFernandezdeLugo2.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Alonso Fernández de Lugo]] presenting the captured native Guanche kings of [[Tenerife]] to the [[Catholic Monarchs]]]]
Historians distinguish two periods in the conquest of the Canary Islands:

'''Aristocratic conquest''' ({{lang|es|conquista señorial}}): This refers to the early conquests carried out by the nobility, for their own benefit and without the direct participation of the Crown of Castile, which merely granted rights of conquest in exchange for pacts of vassalage between the noble conqueror and the Crown. One can identify within this period an early phase known as the Betancurian or Norman conquest, carried out by [[Jean de Bethencourt]] (who was originally from Normandy) and [[Gadifer de la Salle]] between 1402 and 1405, which involved the islands of [[Lanzarote]], [[El Hierro]], and [[Fuerteventura]]. The subsequent phase is known as the Castilian conquest, carried out by Castilian nobles who acquired, through purchases, assignments and marriages, the previously conquered islands and also incorporated the island of [[La Gomera]] around 1450.

'''Royal conquest''' ({{lang|es|conquista realenga}}): This defines the conquest between 1478 and 1496, carried out directly by the Crown of Castile, during the reign of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], who armed and partly financed the conquest of those islands which were still unconquered: [[Gran Canaria]], [[La Palma]] and [[Tenerife]]. This phase of the conquest came to an end in the year 1496, with the dominion of the island of Tenerife, bringing the entire Canarian Archipelago under the control of the Crown of Castile.

[[File:Columbus House-Vegueta-Las Palmas Gran Canaria.jpg|thumb|right|Casa de Colón (Las Palmas de Gran Canaria), which Christopher Columbus visited during his first trip]]
Béthencourt also established a base on the island of La Gomera, but it would be many years before the island was fully conquered. The natives of La Gomera, and of Gran Canaria, Tenerife, and La Palma, resisted the Castilian invaders for almost a century. In 1448, Maciot de Béthencourt sold the lordship of Lanzarote to Portugal's Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], an action that was accepted by neither the natives nor the Castilians. Despite [[Pope Nicholas V#cite ref-8|Pope Nicholas V]] ruling that the Canary Islands were under Portuguese control, the crisis swelled to a revolt which lasted until 1459 with the final expulsion of the Portuguese. In 1479, Portugal and Castile signed the [[Treaty of Alcáçovas]], which settled disputes between Castile and Portugal over the control of the Atlantic. This treaty recognized Castilian control of the Canary Islands but also confirmed Portuguese possession of the [[Azores]], [[Madeira]], and the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde islands]], and gave the Portuguese rights to any further islands or lands in the Atlantic that might be discovered.

The Castilians continued to dominate the islands, but due to the topography and the resistance of the native Guanches, they did not achieve complete control until 1496, when Tenerife and La Palma were finally subdued by [[Alonso Fernández de Lugo]]. As a result of this "the native pre-Hispanic population declined quickly due to war, epidemics, and slavery".<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal |last1=Santana |first1=Jonathan |last2=Fregel |first2=Rosa |last3=Lightfoot |first3=Emma |last4=Morales |first4=Jacob |last5=Alamón |first5=Martha |last6=Guillén |first6=José |last7=Moreno |first7=Marco |last8=Rodríguez |first8=Amelia |date=2016 |title=The early colonial atlantic world: New insights on the African Diaspora from isotopic and ancient DNA analyses of a multiethnic 15th–17th century burial population from the Canary Islands, Spain |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajpa.22879 |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |language=en |volume=159 |issue=2 |pages=300–312 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.22879 |pmid=26458007 |issn=1096-8644 |access-date=5 December 2021 |archive-date=25 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240725064839/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajpa.22879 |url-status=live }}</ref> The Canaries were incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Castile]].

After the conquest, the Castilians imposed a new economic model, based on single-crop cultivation: first [[sugarcane]]; then wine, an important item of trade with [[Kingdom of England|England]]. Gran Canaria was conquered by the [[Crown of Castile]] on 6 March 1480, and Tenerife was conquered in 1496, and each had its own governor. There has been speculation that the abundance of ''[[Roccella tinctoria]]'' on the Canary Islands offered a profit motive for [[Jean de Béthencourt]] during his conquest of the islands. Lichen has been used for centuries to make dyes. This includes royal purple colors derived from ''R. tinctoria'', also known as orseille.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blog.mycology.cornell.edu/2006/12/12/dyeing-with-lichens-mushrooms/ |work=blog.mycology.cornell.edu |author=Randi W. |title=Dyeing with Lichens & Mushrooms |date=12 December 2006 |access-date=22 August 2019 |archive-date=22 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190822150925/https://blog.mycology.cornell.edu/2006/12/12/dyeing-with-lichens-mushrooms/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Research on the skeletons of some of these enslaved workers from the burial site of Finca Clavijo on Gran Canaria have showed that 'all of the adults buried in Finca Clavijo undertook extensive physical activity that involved significant stress on the spine and appendicular skeleton' that result from relentless hard labour, akin to the physical abnormalities found with enslaved peoples from other sugarcane plantations around the world.<ref name=":5" /> These findings of the physical strain that the enslaved at Finca Clavijo were subjected to in order to provide wealth for the Spanish elite has inspired a poem by British writer [https://ralphhoyte.org Ralph Hoyte], entitled ''Close to the Bone''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hoyte |first=Ralph |title=Close to the Bone: Certain Poetic Considerations & Analyses Pertaining To The Lives Of The Enslaved Based On Archaeological Investigations From A Multiethnic 15th–17th Century Burial Population From The Canary Islands, Spain |date=2 February 2021 |url=https://ralphhoyte.org/live-art-poetry/literary-archaeology/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211213120729/https://ralphhoyte.org/live-art-poetry/literary-archaeology/ |archive-date=13 December 2021 }}</ref>

As a result of the huge wealth generated, magnificent palaces and churches were built on La Palma during this busy, prosperous period. The Church of El Salvador survives as one of the island's finest examples of the architecture of the 16th century. Civilian architecture survives in forms such as [[Casas de los Sánchez-Ochando]] or [[Casa Quintana]].

The Canaries' wealth invited attacks by [[pirate]]s and [[privateer]]s. [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[admiral]] and privateer [[Kemal Reis]] ventured into the Canaries in 1501, while [[Murat Reis the Elder]] captured Lanzarote in 1585.

The most severe attack took place in 1599, during the [[Dutch Revolt]]. A [[Dutch people|Dutch]] fleet of 74 ships and 12,000 men, commanded by [[Pieter van der Does]], attacked the capital Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (the city had 3,500 of Gran Canaria's 8,545 inhabitants). The Dutch attacked the Castillo de la Luz, which guarded the harbor. The Canarians evacuated civilians from the city, and the Castillo surrendered (but not the city). The Dutch moved inland, but Canarian cavalry drove them back to Tamaraceite, near the city.

The Dutch then laid siege to the city, demanding the surrender of all its wealth. They received 12 sheep and 3 calves. Furious, the Dutch sent 4,000 soldiers to attack the Council of the Canaries, who were sheltering in the village of Santa Brígida. Three hundred Canarian soldiers ambushed the Dutch in the village of Monte Lentiscal, killing 150 and forcing the rest to retreat. The Dutch concentrated on Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, attempting to burn it down. The Dutch pillaged [[Maspalomas]], on the southern coast of Gran Canaria, [[San Sebastián de La Gomera|San Sebastián]] on La Gomera, and [[Santa Cruz de La Palma|Santa Cruz]] on La Palma, but eventually gave up the siege of Las Palmas and withdrew.

In 1618 the [[Barbary pirates]] from North Africa attacked Lanzarote and La Gomera taking 1000 captives to be sold as [[Barbary slave trade|slaves]].<ref>[[John Mercer (archaeologist)|John Mercer]] (1980), ''The Canary Islanders : their prehistory, conquest, and survival'', p. 236, Collings.</ref> Another noteworthy attack occurred in 1797, when [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797)|Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] was attacked by a British fleet under [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]] on 25 July. The British were repulsed, losing almost 400 men. It was during this battle that Nelson lost his right arm.

The sugar-based economy of the islands faced stiff competition from Spain's [[Caribbean]] colonies. Low sugar prices in the 19th century caused severe recessions on the islands. A new cash crop, [[cochineal]] (''cochinilla''), came into cultivation during this time, reinvigorating the islands' economy. During this time the Canarian-American trade was developed, in which Canarian products such as cochineal, sugarcane and rum were sold in American ports such as [[Veracruz]], [[Campeche]], [[La Guaira]] and [[Havana]], among others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canariascnnews.com/index.php/mirador/canarias/item/1721-el-comercio-canario-americano-en-el-siglo-xviii-i-parte |title=El comercio canario-americano en el siglo XVIII (I parte) |website=Canariascnnews.com |access-date=8 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707091632/http://www.canariascnnews.com/index.php/mirador/canarias/item/1721-el-comercio-canario-americano-en-el-siglo-xviii-i-parte |archive-date=7 July 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Between 1840 and 1890 as many as 40,000 Canary Islanders emigrated to [[Venezuela]]. Also, thousands of Canarians moved to [[Puerto Rico]] where the Spanish monarchy felt that Canarians would adapt to island life better than other immigrants from the mainland of Spain. Deeply entrenched traditions, such as the Mascaras Festival in the town of [[Hatillo, Puerto Rico]], are an example of Canarian culture still preserved in Puerto Rico.

=== Romantic period and scientific expeditions ===
[[File:Coast El Golfo.JPG|thumb|Coast El Golfo, El Hierro]]
Sirera and Renn (2004)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://humboldt.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/10b.monte_en.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060131191143/http://humboldt.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/10b.monte_en.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=31 January 2006 |title=Montesinos Sirera, Jose Luis and Jurgen Renn (2004) ''Expeditions to the Canary Islands in the romantic period (1770–1830)'' |website=Humboldt.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de |access-date=26 April 2010 }}</ref> distinguish two different types of expeditions, or voyages, during the period 1770–1830, which they term "the Romantic period":

First are "expeditions financed by the States, closely related with the official scientific Institutions. characterised by having strict scientific objectives (and inspired by) the spirit of Illustration and progress". In this type of expedition, Sirera and Renn include the following travellers:
* J. Edens, whose 1715 ascent and observations of Mt. Teide influenced many subsequent expeditions.
* [[Louis Feuillée]] (1724), who was sent to measure the meridian of El Hierro and to map the islands.
* [[Jean-Charles de Borda]] (1771, 1776) who more accurately measured the longitudes of the islands and the height of Mount Teide
* the [[Nicolas Baudin|Baudin]]-Ledru expedition (1796) which aimed to recover a valuable collection of natural history objects.

The second type of expedition identified by Sirera and Renn is one that took place starting from more or less private initiatives. Among these, the key exponents were the following:
* [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1799)
* [[Christian Leopold von Buch|Buch]] and [[Christen Smith (botanist)|Smith]] (1815)
* [[Broussonet]]
* [[Philip Barker Webb|Webb]]
* [[Sabin Berthelot]].

Sirera and Renn identify the period 1770–1830 as one in which "In a panorama dominated until that moment by France and England enters with strength and brio Germany of the Romantic period whose presence in the islands will increase".

=== Early 20th century ===
[[File:Bahia luz las palmas 1912 jordao da luz perestello.jpg|thumb|The [[port of Las Palmas]] in 1912]]
At the beginning of the 20th century, the British introduced a new [[cash-crop]], the [[banana]], the export of which was controlled by companies such as [[Fyffes]].

30 November 1833 the [[Province of Canary Islands]] had been created with the capital being declared as Santa Cruz de Tenerife.<ref>[[:m:s:es:Real Decreto de 30 de noviembre de 1833|''Real Decreto de 30 de noviembre de 1833'']] en wikisource</ref> The rivalry between the cities of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Santa Cruz de Tenerife for the capital of the islands led to the division of the [[archipelago]] into two provinces on 23 September 1927.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Real Decreto 1586 |url=https://www.boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE//1927/266/A01659-01660.pdf |language=es |access-date=16 May 2020 |archive-date=9 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210609183651/https://www.boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE//1927/266/A01659-01660.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

During the time of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], [[Marxist]] and [[anarchist]] workers' movements began to develop, led by figures such as Jose Miguel Perez and [[Guillermo Ascanio]]. However, outside of a few municipalities, these organisations were a minority and fell easily to Nationalist forces during the [[Spanish Civil War]].

=== Franco regime ===
{{Main|Francoist Spain}}
In 1936, [[Francisco Franco]] was appointed General Commandant of the Canaries. He joined the military revolt of 17 July which began the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Franco quickly took control of the archipelago, except for a few points of resistance on La Palma and in the town of [[Vallehermoso, Santa Cruz de Tenerife|Vallehermoso]], on La Gomera. Though there was never a war in the islands, the post-war suppression of political dissent on the Canaries was most severe.<ref>{{cite web |last1=León Álvarez |first1=Aarón |title=La represión franquista en Canarias: una guerra de 40 años |language=es |url=http://www.eldiario.es/canariasahora/sociedad/represion-franquista-Canarias-guerra-anos_0_379012266.html |website=canariasahora |date=19 April 2015 |via=eldiario.es |access-date=18 January 2017 |archive-date=31 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131184934/http://www.eldiario.es/canariasahora/sociedad/represion-franquista-Canarias-guerra-anos_0_379012266.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

During the Second World War, [[Winston Churchill]] prepared plans for the British seizure of the Canary Islands as a [[naval base]], in the event of [[Gibraltar]] being invaded from the Spanish mainland.<ref>{{cite book |last=Churchill |first=Winston S. |title=The Second World War Vol 2: Their Finest Hour |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co. |location=Boston |year=1949 |page=519 }}</ref>{{#tag:ref|"So great was the danger that for nearly two years we kept constantly at a few days' notice an expedition of over five thousand men and their ships, ready to seize the Canary Islands, by which we could maintain air and sea control over the U-boats, and contact with Australasia round the Cape, if ever the harbour of Gibraltar were denied to us by the Spaniards."|group="Note"}} The planned operation was known as [[Operation Pilgrim]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Churchill |first=Winston S. |title=The Second World War Vol 3: The Grand Alliance |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co. |location=Boston |year=1950 |page=718 }}</ref>

Opposition to Franco's regime did not begin to organise until the late 1950s, which experienced an upheaval of parties such as the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] and the formation of various nationalist, leftist parties.

During the [[Ifni War]], the Franco regime set up [[concentration camps]] on the islands to [[extrajudicial punishment|extrajudicially imprison]] those in Western Sahara suspected of disloyalty to Spain, many of whom were colonial troops recruited on the spot but were later deemed to be potential [[fifth column]]ists and deported to the Canary Islands. These camps were characterised by the use of forced labour for infrastructure projects and highly unsanitary conditions resulting in the widespread occurrence of [[tuberculosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stucki |first1=Andreas |date=6 February 2018 |title="Frequent Deaths": The Colonial Development of Concentration Camps Reconsidered, 1868–1974 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14623528.2018.1429808 |journal=Journal of Genocide Research |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=305–326 |doi=10.1080/14623528.2018.1429808 |s2cid=80167476 |access-date=10 April 2022 |archive-date=25 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240725064841/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14623528.2018.1429808 |url-status=live }}</ref>

After the death of Franco, there was a pro-independence armed movement based in [[Algeria]], the [[Canary Islands Independence Movement|Movement for the Independence and Self-determination of the Canaries Archipelago]] (MAIAC). In 1968, the [[Organisation of African Unity]] recognized the MAIAC as a legitimate [[African independence movements|African independence movement]], and declared the Canary Islands as an African territory still under foreign rule.<ref>James B. Minahan (2002), ''Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: Ethnic and National Groups Around the World'', p. 377, Greenwood.</ref>

After the establishment of a democratic [[constitutional monarchy]] in Spain, [[self-governance|autonomy]] was granted to the Canaries via a law passed in 1982, with a newly established autonomous devolved government and parliament. In 1983, the first autonomous elections were held. The [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) won.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.parcan.es/ |title=Parlamento de Canarias – Parlamento de Canarias |website=www.parcan.es |access-date=31 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200318112151/https://www.parcan.es/ |archive-date=18 March 2020 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Capitals ===
At present, the Canary Islands is the only autonomous community in Spain that has two capitals: [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] and [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]], since the {{ill|Statute of Autonomy of the Canary Islands|es|Estatuto de Autonomía de Canarias}} was created in 1982.<ref name="es.wikisource.org"/><ref name="gobiernodecanarias.org"/>

The political capital of the archipelago did not exist as such until the nineteenth century. The first cities founded by the [[Europeans]] at the time of the conquest of the Canary Islands in the 15th century were: [[Telde]] (in [[Gran Canaria]]), [[San Marcial del Rubicón]] (in [[Lanzarote]]) and [[Betancuria]] (in [[Fuerteventura]]). These cities boasted the first European institutions present in the archipelago, including [[Catholic]] [[bishoprics]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |url=http://www.juliosanchezrodriguez.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/san_marcial.pdf |title=San Marcial de Rubicón y los obispados de Canarias |access-date=24 May 2016 |author=Julio Sánchez Rodríguez |language=es |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403020508/http://www.juliosanchezrodriguez.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/san_marcial.pdf |archive-date=3 April 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Although, because the period of splendor of these cities developed before the total conquest of the archipelago and its incorporation into the [[Crown of Castile]] never had a political and real control of the entire Canary archipelago.

The function of a Canarian city with full jurisdiction for the entire archipelago only exists after the conquest of the Canary Islands, although originally ''[[de facto]]'', that is, without legal and real meaning and linked to the headquarters of the [[Canary Islands General Captaincy]].

Las Palmas de Gran Canaria was the first city that exercised this function. This is because the residence of the Captain General of the Canary Islands was in this city during part of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.<ref name="junta">La Junta Suprema de Canarias.

Already in 1723, the Captain General of the Canary Islands [[Lorenzo Fernandez de Villavicencio]] had moved the headquarters of the General Captaincy of the Canary Islands from San Cristóbal de La Laguna to Santa Cruz de Tenerife.

Finally, with the Statute of Autonomy of the Canary Islands in 1982 and the creation of the Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands, the capital of the archipelago between Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Santa Cruz de Tenerife is fixed, which is how it remains today.

The Canary Islands have become home to many European residents, mainly coming from Italy, Germany and the UK. Because of the vast immigration to Venezuela and Cuba during the second half of the 20th century and the later return to the Canary Islands of these people along with their families, there are many residents whose country of origin was [[Venezuela]] (66,593) or [[Cuba]] (41,807). Since the 1990s, many [[Immigration to Spain|illegal migrants]] have reached the Canary Islands, [[Melilla]] and [[Ceuta]], using them as entry points to the EU.<ref name="canarias7.es">{{cite web |last=Suárez |first=Borja |date=25 June 2018 |title=El 91% de los nuevos habitantes de Canarias viene del extranjero |url=https://www.canarias7.es/sociedad/el-91-de-los-nuevos-habitantes-de-canarias-viene-del-extranjero-IN4906192 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003220922/https://www.canarias7.es/sociedad/el-91-de-los-nuevos-habitantes-de-canarias-viene-del-extranjero-IN4906192 |archive-date=3 October 2018 |access-date=3 October 2018 |website=www.canarias7.es }}</ref><ref name="ine_pop_19_birthplace" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=Morocco People 2020, CIA World Factbook |url=https://theodora.com/wfbcurrent/morocco/morocco_people.html |access-date=30 January 2022 |website=theodora.com |archive-date=7 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220107163003/https://theodora.com/wfbcurrent/morocco/morocco_people.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{Main|Religion in Canary Islands}}
[[File:Candelaria Basilica.jpg|thumb|[[Basilica of Candelaria|Basilica of the Virgin of Candelaria]] (Patroness of the Canary Islands) in [[Candelaria, Tenerife|Candelaria]], Tenerife]]
The [[Catholic Church]] has been the majority religion in the archipelago for more than five centuries, ever since the [[Conquest of the Canary Islands]]. There are also several other religious communities.

==== Roman Catholic Church ====
The overwhelming majority of native Canarians are [[Roman Catholic]] (76.7%)<ref name=CIS2019Canarias>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cis.es/cis/export/sites/default/-Archivos/Marginales/3260_3279/3263/Marginales/es3263mar_Canarias.pdf |author=''Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas'' (Centre for Sociological Research) |title=Macrobarómetro de octubre 2019, Banco de datos – Document 'Población con derecho a voto en elecciones generales y residente en España, Canarias (aut.) |date=October 2019 |page=23 |access-date=4 February 2020 |language=es |archive-date=4 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200204180445/http://www.cis.es/cis/export/sites/default/-Archivos/Marginales/3260_3279/3263/Marginales/es3263mar_Canarias.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> with various smaller foreign-born populations of other Christian beliefs such as [[Protestants]].

The appearance of the [[Virgin of Candelaria]] (Patron of Canary Islands) was credited with moving the Canary Islands toward Christianity. Two Catholic saints were born in the Canary Islands: [[Peter of Saint Joseph de Betancur]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.es.catholic.net/op/articulos/35981/pedro-de-san-jos-betancurt-santo.html |title=Pedro de San José Betancurt, Santo |website=Es.catholic.net |access-date=23 December 2015 |archive-date=23 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223190733/http://www.es.catholic.net/op/articulos/35981/pedro-de-san-jos-betancurt-santo.html |url-status=live }}</ref> and [[José de Anchieta]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://es.catholic.net/op/articulos/35379/jos-de-anchieta-santo.html |title=José de Anchieta, Santo |website=Es.catholic.net |access-date=23 December 2015 |archive-date=22 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222164128/http://es.catholic.net/op/articulos/35379/jos-de-anchieta-santo.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Both born on the island of Tenerife, they were respectively missionaries in [[Guatemala]] and [[Brazil]].

The Canary Islands are divided into two Catholic dioceses, each governed by a bishop:
* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Canarias|Diócesis Canariense]]: Includes the islands of the [[Province of Las Palmas|Eastern Province]]: Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura and Lanzarote. Its capital was San Marcial El Rubicón (1404) and [[Las Palmas|Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] (1483–present). There was a previous bishopric which was based in [[Telde]], but it was later abolished.
* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Cristóbal de La Laguna|Diócesis Nivariense]]: Includes the islands of the [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife (province)|western province]]: Tenerife, La Palma, La Gomera and El Hierro. Its capital is [[San Cristóbal de La Laguna]] (1819–present).

==== Other religions ====
Separate from the overwhelming Catholic majority are a minority of [[Muslims]].<ref name="laopinion.es">{{cite web |url=http://www.laopinion.es/sociedad/2008/10/03/sociedad-canarios-profesa-religion-minoritaria/173826.html |title=Un 5% de canarios profesa una religión minoritaria |first=La Opinión de |last=Tenerife |website=Laopinion.es |access-date=3 July 2015 |archive-date=11 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911221703/http://www.laopinion.es/sociedad/2008/10/03/sociedad-canarios-profesa-religion-minoritaria/173826.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Among the followers of [[Islam]], the [[Islamic Federation of the Canary Islands]] exists to represent the Islamic community in the Canary Islands as well as to provide practical support to members of the Islamic community.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laopinion.es/tenerife/2015/04/16/musulmanes-isla-constituyen-primera-federacion/601084.html |title=Los musulmanes de la Isla constituyen la primera Federación Islámica de Canarias |first=La Opinión de |last=Tenerife |website=Laopinion.es |access-date=2 May 2016 |archive-date=12 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912015111/http://www.laopinion.es/tenerife/2015/04/16/musulmanes-isla-constituyen-primera-federacion/601084.html |url-status=live }}</ref> For its part, there is also the [[Evangelical Council of the Canary Islands]] in the archipelago.

Other religious faiths represented include [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] as well as [[Hinduism]].<ref name="laopinion.es"/> Minority religions are also present such as the [[Church of the Guanche People]] which is classified as a [[Modern Paganism|neo-pagan]] native religion.<ref name="laopinion.es"/> Also present are [[Buddhism]],<ref name="laopinion.es"/> [[Judaism]],<ref name="laopinion.es"/> [[Baháʼí Faith|Baháʼí]],<ref name="laopinion.es"/> [[African religion]],<ref name="laopinion.es"/> and [[Chinese religions]].<ref name="laopinion.es"/>

The economy is based primarily [[Tourism in the Canary Islands|on tourism]], which makes up 32% of the GDP. The Canaries receive about 12&nbsp;million tourists per year. Construction makes up nearly 20% of the GDP and tropical agriculture, primarily bananas and tobacco, are grown for export to Europe and the Americas. Ecologists are concerned that the resources, especially in the more [[arid]] islands, are being [[overexploited]] but there are still many agricultural resources like [[tomato]]es, [[potato]]es, [[onion]]s, [[cochineal]], [[sugarcane]], [[grape]]s, [[vine]]s, [[Phoenix dactylifera|date]]s, [[Orange (fruit)|orange]]s, [[lemon]]s, [[ficus|fig]]s, [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[maize]], [[apricot]]s, [[peach]]es and [[almond]]s.

Water resources are also being overexploited, due to the high water usage by tourists.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255948730 |title=INTRODUCTION TO WATER PROBLEMS IN CANARY ISLANDS |first1=Juan |last1=Santamarta |first2=Jesica |last2=Rodríguez-Martín |date=1 January 2013 |pages=169–179 |access-date=31 January 2020 |via=ResearchGate |archive-date=9 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210609183652/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255948730_INTRODUCTION_TO_WATER_PROBLEMS_IN_CANARY_ISLANDS |url-status=live }}</ref> Also, some islands (such as Gran Canaria and Tenerife) [[Groundwater extraction|overexploit the ground water]]. This is done in such degree that, according to European and Spanish legal regulations, the current situation is not acceptable. To address the problems, good governance and a change in the water use paradigm have been proposed. These solutions depend largely on [[Water conservation|controlling water use]] and on demand management. As this is administratively difficult and politically unpalatable, most action is currently directed at increasing the public offer of water through import from outside; a decision which is economically, politically and environmentally questionable.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Groundwater mining: benefits, problems and consequences in Spain |first1=Emilio |last1=Custodio |first2=José |last2=Albiac |first3=Manuel |last3=Cermerón |first4=Marta |last4=Hernández |first5=M.

To bring in revenue for environmental protection, innovation, training and water sanitation a [[tourist tax]] was considered in 2018, along with a doubling of the [[ecotax]] and restrictions on holiday rents in the zones with the greatest pressure of demand.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/canary-islands/news/canary-islands-tourism-tax/ |title=The Canary Islands could become the next holiday hotspot to introduce a tourist tax |first=Soo |last=Kim |website=The Telegraph |date=25 January 2018 |access-date=31 January 2020 |archive-date=31 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200131120605/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/canary-islands/news/canary-islands-tourism-tax/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The economy is [[Euro|€]] 25&nbsp;billion (2001 GDP figures). The islands experienced continuous growth during a 20-year period, up until 2001, at a rate of approximately 5% annually. This growth was fueled mainly by huge amounts of [[foreign direct investment]], mostly to develop tourism real estate (hotels and apartments), and European Funds (near €11&nbsp;billion in the period from 2000 to 2007), since the Canary Islands are labelled Region Objective 1 (eligible for euro structural funds).{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Additionally, the EU allows the Canary Islands Government to offer special tax concessions for investors who incorporate under the Zona Especial Canaria (ZEC) regime and create more than five jobs.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Spain gave permission in August 2014 for [[Repsol]] and its partners to explore [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] prospects off the Canary Islands, involving an investment of €7.5&nbsp;billion over four years, to commence at the end of 2016. Repsol at the time said the area could ultimately produce 100,000 barrels of oil a day, which would meet 10 percent of Spain's energy needs.<ref name="RepsolCanary">{{cite news |title=Spain's Repsol gets long awaited green signal to explore off Canary Islands |url=http://www.spainnews.net/index.php/sid/224721995 |date=13 August 2014 |access-date=13 August 2014 |website=Spain News.Net |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814083307/http://www.spainnews.net/index.php/sid/224721995 |archive-date=14 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, the analysis of samples obtained did not show the necessary volume nor quality to consider future extraction, and the project was scrapped.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.repsol.com/es_en/corporacion/prensa/notas-de-prensa/ultimas-notas/16012015-repsol-finaliza-el-sondeo-exploratorio-en-canarias.aspx |title=Repsol completes its exploration well in the Canary Islands - repsol.com |website=Repsol.com |access-date=8 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220075026/https://www.repsol.com/es_en/corporacion/prensa/notas-de-prensa/ultimas-notas/16012015-repsol-finaliza-el-sondeo-exploratorio-en-canarias.aspx |archive-date=20 December 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Despite currently having very high dependence on fossil fuels, research on the renewable energy potential concluded that a high potential for renewable energy technologies exists on the archipelago. This, in such extent even that a scenario pathway to 100% renewable energy supply by 2050 has been put forward.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261916317871 |title=Carbon neutral archipelago – 100% renewable energy supply for the Canary Islands |year=2017 |doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.12.023 |access-date=23 January 2021 |archive-date=30 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200630161253/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261916317871 |url-status=live |last1=Gils |first1=Hans Christian |last2=Simon |first2=Sonja |journal=Applied Energy |volume=188 |pages=342–355 |bibcode=2017ApEn..188..342G }}</ref>

The Canary Islands have great natural attractions, climate and [[beach]]es make the islands a major tourist destination, being visited each year by about 12&nbsp;million people (11,986,059 in 2007, noting 29% of [[United Kingdom|Britons]], 22% of Spanish (from outside the Canaries), and 21% of [[Germany|Germans]]). Among the islands, Tenerife has the largest number of tourists received annually, followed by Gran Canaria and Lanzarote.<ref name="gobiernodecanarias1"/> The archipelago's principal tourist attraction is the [[Teide National Park]] (in Tenerife) where the highest mountain in Spain and third largest [[volcano]] in the world (Mount [[Teide]]), receives over 2.8&nbsp;million visitors annually.<ref name="webtenerife2">{{Cite web |url=http://www.webtenerife.com/PortalTenerife/Home/Disfruta+vacaciones+activas/Ocio/Durante+el+dia/Excursiones/EL+TEIDE.htm?Lang=es |title=Página Web Oficial de Turismo de Tenerife; El Teide |website=Webtenerife.com |access-date=26 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116025912/http://www.webtenerife.com/PortalTenerife/Home/Disfruta%2Bvacaciones%2Bactivas/Ocio/Durante%2Bel%2Bdia/Excursiones/EL%2BTEIDE.htm?Lang=es |archive-date=16 January 2010 }}</ref>

The combination of high mountains, proximity to Europe, and clean air has made the [[Roque de los Muchachos]] peak (on La Palma island) a leading location for [[telescope]]s like the [[Grantecan]].

The islands, as an autonomous region of Spain, are in the [[European Union]] and the [[Schengen Area]]. They are in the [[European Union Customs Union]] but outside the [[VAT]] area.<ref name="territories">{{Cite web |title=Territorial status of EU countries and certain territories |url=https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/territorial-status-eu-countries-and-certain-territories_en |access-date=13 January 2023 |website=taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu |language=en |archive-date=20 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230620021134/https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/territorial-status-eu-countries-and-certain-territories_en |url-status=live }}</ref> Instead of VAT there is a local Sales Tax (IGIC) which has a general rate of 7%, an increased tax rate of 13.5%, a reduced tax rate of 3% and a zero tax rate for certain basic need products and services. Consequently, some products are subject to additional VAT if being exported from the islands into mainland Spain or the rest of the EU.

Canarian time is [[Western European Time]] (WET), or [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]]. In summer, one hour ahead of GMT. Canarian time is one hour behind mainland Spain, and the same time as the UK, Ireland and mainland Portugal all year round.

Large [[ferry]] boats and fast ferries link most of the islands. Both types can transport large numbers of passengers, cargo, and vehicles. Fast ferries are made of aluminium and powered by modern and efficient diesel engines, while conventional ferries have a steel hull and are powered by heavy oil. Fast ferries travel in excess of {{Cvt|30|knot|km/h mph}}; conventional ferries travel in excess of {{Cvt|20|kn|km/h mph}}, but are slower than fast ferries.{{Citation needed|reason=Figures not clarified in Ferry article.|date=May 2021}} A typical ferry ride between La Palma and Tenerife may take up to eight hours or more while a fast ferry takes about two and a half hours and between Tenerife and Gran Canaria can be about one hour.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Las Palmas de Gran Canaria to Santa Cruz de Tenerife Ferry from $31 {{!}} Tickets & Timetables |url=https://www.rome2rio.com/Ferry/Las-Palmas-de-Gran-Canaria/Santa-Cruz-de-Tenerife |access-date=12 July 2022 |website=Rome2rio |language=en }}</ref>

=== Fauna ===
{{See also|List of birds of the Canary Islands|List of reptiles of the Canary Islands|List of Lepidoptera of the Canary Islands|List of non-marine molluscs of the Canary Islands}}

The bird life includes European and African species, such as the [[black-bellied sandgrouse]], [[Atlantic canary|Canary]], Graja, a subspecies of [[red-billed chough]] endemic to La Palma, [[Gran Canaria blue chaffinch]], [[Tenerife blue chaffinch]], [[Canary Islands chiffchaff]], [[Fuerteventura chat]], [[Tenerife goldcrest]], [[La Palma chaffinch]], [[Canarian Egyptian vulture]], [[Bolle's pigeon]], [[Laurel pigeon]], [[Plain swift]], and [[Houbara bustard]].

Terrestrial fauna includes the [[El Hierro giant lizard]], [[Tachina canariensis]], [[La Gomera giant lizard]], and the [[La Palma giant lizard]]. Mammals include the [[Canarian shrew]], [[Canary big-eared bat]], the [[Algerian hedgehog]], and the more recently introduced [[mouflon]].

==== Extinct fauna ====
[[File:Canariomys bravoi skull.JPG|thumb|Skull of [[Tenerife giant rat]] (''Canariomys bravoi''), an endemic species that is now extinct]]

=== Marine life ===
{{Main|Marine life of the Canary Islands}}
[[File:Caretta caretta 060417w2.jpg|thumb|A [[loggerhead sea turtle]], by far the most common species of marine turtle in the Canary Islands]]
The [[marine life]] found in the Canary Islands is also varied, being a combination of [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]], [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[endemism|endemic]] species. In recent years, the increasing popularity of both [[scuba diving]] and [[underwater photography]] have provided biologists with much new information on the marine life of the islands.

Fish species found in the islands include many species of [[shark]], [[Batoidea|ray]], [[moray eel]], [[Sparidae|bream]], [[Carangidae|jack]], [[Grunt-fish|grunt]], [[scorpionfish]], [[triggerfish]], [[grouper]], [[goby]], and [[blenny]]. In addition, there are many invertebrate species, including [[sponge]], [[jellyfish]], [[Sea anemone|anemone]], [[crab]], [[mollusc]], [[sea urchin]], [[starfish]], [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumber]] and [[coral]].

There are a total of five different species of [[marine turtle]] that are sighted periodically in the islands, the most common of these being the [[endangered]] [[loggerhead sea turtle]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Lissie Wright |author2=Brian Groombridge |title=The IUCN Amphibia-reptilia Red Data Book |url=https://archive.org/details/iucnamphibiarept82groo |year=1982 |publisher=IUCN |isbn=978-2-88032-601-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/iucnamphibiarept82groo/page/140 140] }}</ref> The other four are the [[green sea turtle]], [[hawksbill sea turtle]], [[leatherback sea turtle]] and [[Kemp's ridley sea turtle]]. Currently, there are no signs that any of these species breed in the islands, and so those seen in the water are usually [[wikt:migration|migrating]]. However, it is believed that some of these species may have bred in the islands in the past, and there are records of several sightings of leatherback sea turtle on beaches in Fuerteventura, adding credibility to the theory.

The most famous festivals of the Canary Islands is the carnival. It is the most famous and international festival of the archipelago. The carnival is celebrated in all the islands and all its municipalities, perhaps the two busiest are those of the two Canarian capitals; the [[Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] (''Tourist Festival of International Interest'') and the [[Carnival of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]]. It is celebrated on the streets between the months of February and March. But the rest of the islands of the archipelago have their carnivals with their own traditions among which stand out: The Festival of the Carneros of [[El Hierro]], the Festival of the Diabletes of [[Teguise (municipality)|Teguise]] in [[Lanzarote]], Los Indianos de [[La Palma]], the Carnival of [[San Sebastián de La Gomera]] and the Carnival of [[Puerto del Rosario]] in [[Fuerteventura]].

==Science and technology==
[[File:Erdfunkstelle Gran Canaria-3.JPG|thumb|Gran Canaria space tracking station]]
In the 1960s, Gran Canaria was selected as the location for one of the 14 [[ground stations]] in the [[Manned Space Flight Network]] (MSFN) to support the [[NASA]] space program. [[Maspalomas Station]], located in the south of the island, took part in a number of space missions including the [[Apollo 11]] Moon landings and [[Skylab]]. Today it continues to support satellite communications as part of the [[ESA]] network.<ref name="esa-page">{{cite web |title=Maspalomas station |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Estrack/Maspalomas_station |website=European Space Agency |access-date=8 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190208113652/http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Estrack/Maspalomas_station |archive-date=8 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Because of the remote location, a number of [[Observatory|astronomical observatories]] are located in the archipelago, including the [[Teide Observatory]] on Tenerife, the [[Roque de los Muchachos Observatory]] on La Palma, and the [[Temisas Astronomical Observatory]] on Gran Canaria.

Tenerife is the home of the [[Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias]] (Astrophysical Institute of the Canaries). There is also an Instituto de Bio-Orgánica Antonio González (Antonio González Bio-Organic Institute) at the [[University of La Laguna]]. Also at that university are the Instituto de Lingüística Andrés Bello (Andrés Bello Institute of Linguistics), the Centro de Estudios Medievales y Renacentistas (Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies), the Instituto Universitario de la Empresa (University Institute of Business), the Instituto de Derecho Regional (Regional Institute of Law), the Instituto Universitario de Ciencias Políticas y Sociales (University Institute of Political and Social Sciences) and the Instituto de Enfermedades Tropicales (Institute of Tropical Diseases). The latter is one of the seven institutions of the Red de Investigación de Centros de Enfermedades Tropicales (RICET, "Network of Research of Centers of Tropical Diseases"), located in various parts of Spain. The Instituto Volcanológico de Canarias (Volcanological Institute of the Canary Islands) is based in Tenerife.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

A unique form of wrestling known as [[Canarian wrestling]] (''lucha canaria'') has opponents stand in a special area called a "terrero" and try to throw each other to the ground using strength and quick movements.<ref name="ctspanish.com">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ctspanish.com/communities/canarym/canary%20islands.htm |title=The Canary Islands |website=Ctspanish.com |date=21 October 1971 |access-date=21 January 2010 |archive-date=11 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201111212930/http://www.ctspanish.com/communities/canarym/canary%20islands.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Another sport is the "game of the sticks" (palo canario) where opponents fence with long sticks. This may have come about from the shepherds of the islands who would challenge each other using their long walking sticks.<ref name="ctspanish.com"/>

Furthermore, there is the [[Salto del pastor|shepherd's jump]] (''salto del pastor''). This involves using a long stick to vault over an open area. This sport possibly evolved from the shepherd's need to occasionally get over an open area in the hills as they were tending their sheep.<ref name="ctspanish.com"/>

The two main [[Association football|football]] teams in the archipelago are: the [[CD Tenerife]] (founded in 1912) and [[UD Las Palmas]] (founded in 1949). As of the 2023/2024 season, UD Las Palmas plays in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football. CD Tenerife however plays in The Segunda Divisón. When in the same division, the clubs contest the [[Canary Islands derby]]. There are smaller clubs also playing in the mainland [[Spanish football league system]], most notably [[UD Lanzarote]] and [[CD Laguna de Tenerife|CD Laguna]], although no other Canarian clubs have played in the top flight.

The mountainous terrain of the Canary Islands also caters to the growing popularity of [[ultra running]] and [[ultramarathons]] as host of annual competitive long-distance events including [[CajaMar Tenerife Bluetrail]] on [[Tenerife]], [[Transvulcania]] on [[La Palma]], [[Transgrancanaria]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.transgrancanaria.net/en/ |title=Transgrancanaria (English website) |access-date=15 January 2018 |archive-date=30 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201030214948/https://www.transgrancanaria.net/en/ |url-status=live }}</ref> on [[Gran Canaria]], and the Half [[Marathon des Sables]] on [[Fuerteventura]].
