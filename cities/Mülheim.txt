'''Mülheim''', officially '''Mülheim an der Ruhr''' ({{langx|nds|Mölm}}; {{langx|ksh|Müllem}}; {{IPA|de|ˈmyːlhaɪm ʔan deːɐ̯ ˈʁuːɐ̯|-|De-Mülheim_(Ruhr).ogg}}) and also described as ''"City on the River"'', is a [[List of cities and towns in Germany|city]] in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] in [[Germany]]. It is located in the [[Ruhr Area]] between [[Duisburg]], [[Essen, Germany|Essen]], [[Oberhausen]] and [[Ratingen]]. It is home to many companies, and two [[Max Planck Society|Max Planck Institutes]].

Mülheim an der Ruhr received its town charter in 1808, and 100 years later the population exceeded 100,000, making Mülheim officially a city. At the time of the city's 200th anniversary with approximately 170,000 residents, it was counted among the smaller cities of Germany.

==Geography==

===Geographical location===
Mülheim an der Ruhr is located to the southwest of [[Essen]] in the Ruhr valley.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mülheim an der Ruhr |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Mulheim-an-der-Ruhr |publisher=[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]] |access-date=5 December 2020}}</ref>

[[File:Ruhrtalbruecke-Sonnenuntergang.jpg|thumb|left|The bridge Mintarder Ruhrtalbrücke in Mülheim, crosses the Ruhr connecting [[Düsseldorf]] and [[Essen]]]]

===Geology===

The northern foothills of the [[Rhenish Massif]] are characterised by the distinctive rock formation of the bare mountain slopes through which run coal-bearing layers which formed during the [[carboniferous]] period. Here the Ruhr cuts more than 50 meters deep into this [[Mittelgebirge]]. This natural [[erosion]] partly uncovered these mineable [[bituminous coal|black coal]] deposits, which enabled their exploration and extraction using [[adit]]s. However, the coal-rich layers became ever deeper as one progressed northward, which required setting up [[mining|mines]] to extract the black coal. In contrast, the broad [[bayou]] (dead arm of a river) of Styrum borough is characteristic of the features of the Lower Rhine Plain.<ref name="Mülheim Geology">{{cite web|url=http://www.muelheim-ruhr.de/cms/muelheim_im_wandel_dererdgeschichte.html|title=Mülheim an der Ruhr official website – Eine kurze Geschichte zur Geologie und zur Geographie des Stadtgebietes|access-date=2010-04-19|publisher= [[File:Flag of Germany.svg|border|10px]] {{fontcolor|Green|(in only [[German language|{{fontcolor|Green|German}}]])}} [[copyright|©]] 1998–2010 MST Mülheimer Stadtmarketing und Tourismus GmbH}}''</ref>
