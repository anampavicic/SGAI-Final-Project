'''Hamilton''' ({{lang-mi|Kirikiriroa}}) is an inland city in the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]]. Located on the banks of the [[Waikato River]], it is the seat and most populous city of the [[Waikato|Waikato region]]. With a territorial population of {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Hamilton|y}}}},<ref name="NZ_population_data_2018" /> it is the country's [[List of cities in New Zealand|fourth most-populous city]]. Encompassing a land area of about {{convert|110|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.localcouncils.govt.nz/lgip.nsf/wpg_url/Profiles-Councils-Hamilton-City-Council-main|title= Hamilton City Council|access-date=9 December 2014|publisher=Internal Affairs}}</ref> Hamilton is part of the wider [[Hamilton Urban Area]], which also encompasses the nearby towns of [[Ngāruawāhia]], [[Te Awamutu]] and [[Cambridge, New Zealand|Cambridge]]. In 2020, Hamilton was awarded the title of most beautiful large city in New Zealand.<ref>{{Cite web|date=29 October 2020|title=Hamilton and Whanganui tie for most beautiful city in New Zealand|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/news/123240109/hamilton-and-whanganui-tie-for-most-beautiful-city-in-new-zealand|access-date=30 October 2020|website=Stuff|language=en}}</ref> Hamilton is now considered the fastest growing city in the country.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Stuff |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/350190345/move-over-tauranga-hamiltons-taken-crown |access-date=2024-07-03 |website=www.stuff.co.nz}}</ref>

The area now covered by the city began as the site of several [[Māori people|Māori]] villages, including Kirikiriroa, from which the city takes its Māori name. By the time English settlers arrived, most of these villages, which sat beside the Waikato River, were abandoned as a result of the [[Invasion of Waikato]] and [[New Zealand land confiscations|land confiscation]] (''Raupatu'') by the Crown.

The settlers developed the city as an agricultural service centre, but it now has a diverse economy. [[Hamilton Gardens]] is the region's most popular tourist attraction. Education and [[research and development]] play an important part in Hamilton's economy, as the city is home to approximately 40,000 tertiary students and 1,000 PhD-qualified scientists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opportunityhamilton.co.nz/page/pageid/2145844805/Hamilton_Facts|title=Hamilton's Economy|access-date=23 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724193817/http://www.opportunityhamilton.co.nz/page/pageid/2145844805/Hamilton_Facts|archive-date=24 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==History==
===Pre-European settlement===
The area now covered by the city was originally the site of several Māori villages (kāinga), including Te Parapara,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hamiltongardens.co.nz/collections/productive-collection/te-parapara-garden/|title=Te Parapara Garden |website=[[Hamilton Gardens]] |access-date=8 July 2021}}</ref> Pukete, Miropiko and Kirikiriroa ("long stretch of gravel'), from which the city takes its Māori name. Local Māori were the target of raids by [[Ngāpuhi]] during the [[Musket Wars]],<ref name=Crosby>Crosby, Ron, The Musket Wars – A History of Inter-Iwi Conflict 1806–45, Reed, Auckland, 1999.</ref> and several [[Pā (Māori)|pā]] sites from this period can still be found beside the Waikato River. In December 2011 several rua or food storage pits were found near the Waikato River bank, close to the Waikato museum.

In 1822, Kirikiriroa Pa was briefly abandoned to escape the Musket Wars. However, by the 1830s [[Ngāti Wairere|Ngati Wairere]]’s principal pa was Kirikiriroa,<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hamiltoncityriverplan.co.nz/uploads/files/HCRP%20Arch%20Assessment%20FINAL%2003092015.pdf|title=Desk-top Archaeological Assessment Prepared for Hamilton City Council by OPUS|date=September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101030448/http://www.hamiltoncityriverplan.co.nz/uploads/files/HCRP%20Arch%20Assessment%20FINAL%2003092015.pdf|archive-date=1 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> where the missionaries, who arrived at that time,<ref name="Wises">Wises New Zealand Guide, 7th Edition, 1979. p. 129.</ref> estimated 200 people lived permanently.<ref name=":1" /> A chapel and house were built at Kirikiriroa for visiting clergy,<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hamilton.govt.nz/our-city/parks/parksandgardens/Documents/Maori%20Landmarks%20on%20Riverside%20Reserves%20-%20Nga%20Tapuwae%20O%20Hotumauea%20-%20Reserves%20Act%20Management%20Plan%20-%20Operative%20-%20April%202003.pdf|title="Nga Tapuwae O Hotumauea" MAORI LANDMARKS ON RIVERSIDE RESERVES Management Plan|date=April 2003|website=Hamilton City Council|access-date=31 December 2017|archive-date=1 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201030517/http://www.hamilton.govt.nz/our-city/parks/parksandgardens/Documents/Maori%20Landmarks%20on%20Riverside%20Reserves%20-%20Nga%20Tapuwae%20O%20Hotumauea%20-%20Reserves%20Act%20Management%20Plan%20-%20Operative%20-%20April%202003.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> presumably after [[New Zealand Church Missionary Society#Early CMS personnel in New Zealand|Benjamin Ashwell]] established his mission near Taupiri.

Between 1845 and 1855, crops such as wheat, fruit and potatoes were exported to Auckland, with up to 50 canoes serving Kirikiriroa. Imports included blankets, clothing, axes, sugar, rum, and tobacco.<ref name=":2" /> Millstones were acquired and a water wheel constructed, though possibly the flour mill wasn't completed.<ref name=":1" /> However, one article said Kirikiriroa flour was well known.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH18690630.2.13|title=FLAX.

Magistrate Gorst, estimated that Kirikiriroa had a population of about 78 before the [[Invasion of Waikato]] via the Waikato Wars of 1863–64. The government estimated the Waikato area had a Māori population of 3,400 at the same time. After the war in the Waikato, large areas of land (1.2 Million Acres), including the area of the present city of Hamilton were confiscated by the Crown under the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.govt.nz/dmsdocument/3778-waikato-tainui-deed-of-settlement-22-may-1995 |title=={{!}}access-date=15 March 2019 |access-date=14 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190709023412/https://www.govt.nz/dmsdocument/3778-waikato-tainui-deed-of-settlement-22-may-1995 |archive-date=9 July 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Over the next year, most of these villages were abandoned as a result of the [[New Zealand land confiscations|land confiscation]], also known as ''[[New Zealand land confiscations|Raupatu]]''.

Many of the soldier/settlers who intended to farm after the 1863 war, walked off their land in 1868 due to its poor quality. Much of the land was swampy or under water.

As of 2016, the city continues to grow rapidly. Development is focused on the northern end of the city although in 2012 the council made a decision to balance the city's growth by approving an urban development to the south. Traffic congestion is increasing due to population growth, though the council has undertaken many road development projects to try to keep up with the rapid growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hamilton.co.nz/page/pageid/2145827444|title=Access Hamilton|work=Hamilton City Council|access-date=27 August 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923132433/http://hamilton.co.nz/page/pageid/2145827444|archive-date=23 September 2010}}</ref> [[State Highway 1 (New Zealand)|State Highway 1]] runs through the western and southern suburbs and has a major junction with [[State Highway 3 (New Zealand)|State Highway 3]] south of the city centre, which contributes to congestion.

The rapid growth of Hamilton has brought with it the side effects of [[urban sprawl]] especially to the north east of the city in the [[Rototuna]] area. Further development is planned in the Rototuna and [[Peacocke, Waikato|Peacocke]] suburbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hamilton.co.nz/page/pageid/2145833439|title=City Expansion|work=Hamilton City Council|access-date=27 August 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929000522/http://hamilton.co.nz/page/pageid/2145833439|archive-date=29 September 2010}}</ref> There has been significant development of [[lifestyle block]]s adjacent to the Hamilton Urban Area, in particular [[Tamahere]], and [[Matangi, New Zealand|Matangi]].

[[File:Waikato_River_in_Hamilton_Central_from_Parana_Park.jpg|thumb|Waikato River in Hamilton Central from Parana Park]]

Hamilton's geography is largely the result of successive volcanic ash falls, plus debris, which swept down the Waikato River in at least two massive floods, created by ash blocking the outlet of [[Lake Taupō]]. In its present form the landscape originated around 20,000 years ago (20 [[Kya (unit)|kya]]), after the [[Oruanui eruption]] of the [[Taupō Volcano]]. The dates given for the eruption vary. A 2007 study said it was between 22.5 and 14 kya.<ref name=":82">{{Cite web|title=Waikato River Bank Erosion|url=https://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/assets/PageFiles/11266/Waikato%20River%20erosion%20study.pdf|date=17 April 2007|website=Waikato Regional Council}}</ref> Another in 2004 put it 26.5 kya. After the eruption [[Lake Taupō]] rose to about {{Convert|145|m||abbr=on}} above the present lake. Around 20 kya. the ash dam eroded and the lake rapidly fell some {{Convert|75|m||abbr=on}}, creating massive floods. The ash they carried formed the main Hinuera Surface into an [[alluvial fan]] of volcanic ash, which extends north of Hamilton and drops about {{Convert|60|m||abbr=on}} from [[Lake Karapiro|Karapiro]]. The Waikato changed its course from flowing into the sea at [[Thames, New Zealand|Thames]] at about that time, possibly just because sediment built up. The [[Lake#Peat lakes|peat lakes]] and bogs also formed about that time; [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon dating]] gives maximum ages of 22.5 to 17 kya. Due to an [[Late Cenozoic Ice Age|ice age]], vegetation was slow to restabilise the ash, so [[dune]]s formed up to {{Convert|25|m||abbr=on}} above the local Hinuera surface. The current Waikato valley had cut into the debris by about 12 kya. and was further modified by the 181 CE [[Hatepe eruption]], when again Lake Taupō level fell {{Convert|34|m||abbr=on}}, generating a {{Convert|20|km3||abbr=on}} flood, equivalent to 5 years' normal flow in just a few weeks.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The 26.5 kya Oruanui eruption, New Zealand: a review of the roles of volcanism and climate in the post-eruptive sedimentary response|last=Vern Manville & Colin J.

With the exceptions of the many low hills such as those around the [[University of Waikato]], Hamilton Lake, Beerescourt, Sylvester Road, Pukete, and to the west of the city, and an extensive network of gullies, the terrain of the city is relatively flat. In some areas such as Te Rapa, one old path of an ancient river can be traced. The relatively soft and unconsolidated soil material is still being actively eroded by rain and runoff.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

In its natural state, Hamilton and environs was very swampy in winter with 30 small lakes connected to surrounding peatlands. Hamilton was surrounded by 7 large peat bogs such as Komakorau to the North and Rukuhia and [[Moanatuatua Scientific Reserve|Moanatuatua]] to the South, as well as many smaller ones all of which have now been drained with only small remnants remaining.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ausseil|first1=A.-G.

Up until the 1880s it was possible to row and drag a dinghy from the city to many outlying farms to the North East. This swampy, damp environment was at the time thought to be an ideal breeding ground for the TB bacillus, which was a major health hazard in the pioneering days. The first Hamilton hospital was constructed on a hill to avoid this problem. One of the reasons why population growth was so slow in Hamilton until the 1920s was the great difficulty in bridging the many arms of the deep swampy gullies that cross the city. Hamilton has 6 major dendritic gully complexes with the 15&nbsp;km long, 12 branch, Kirikiriroa system being in the north of the city and the southern Mystery creek-Kaipaki gully complex being the largest.<ref>The Wandering River. p45.p50</ref> Others are Mangakotukutuku, Mangaonua and Waitawhiriwhiri.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Central Waikato Zone Plan|url=https://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/assets/WRC/Council/Policy-and-Plans/hazard-catchment-management/zone-management-plans/Central-Waikato-Zone-Plan.pdf|date=2017|website=Waikato Regional Council}}</ref>

In the 1930s, Garden Place Hill, one of the many small hills sometimes referred to as the Hamilton Hills, was removed by unemployed workers working with picks and shovels and model T Ford trucks. The Western remains of the hill are retained by a large concrete wall. The original hill ran from the present [[Waikato Institute of Technology|Wintec]] site eastwards to the old post office (now casino). The earth was taken 4&nbsp;km north to partly fill the Maeroa gully adjacent to the Central Baptist Church on Ulster Street, the main road heading north.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19301103.2.122|title=COLLAPSE OF BRIDGE.

[[Lake Rotoroa (Hamilton, New Zealand)|Lake Rotoroa]] (Hamilton Lake) began forming about 20,000 years ago (20 kya). Originally it was part of an ancient river system that was cut off by deposition material and became two small lakes divided by a narrow peninsula. With higher rainfall and drainage from the extensive peat land to the west, the water level rose so the narrow peninsula was drowned so forming one larger lake. To the north the lake is 8&nbsp;m deep and in the southern (hospital) end 6&nbsp;m deep. The old dividing peninsula, the start of which is still visible above water on the eastern side, is only 2&nbsp;m below the surface. Lake Rotoroa offers a diverse range of recreational activities, including [[walking trails]], picnic areas, and [[water sports]], making it a popular destination for both locals and tourists. The well-maintained paths around the lake are ideal for jogging, walking, and cycling. These trails offer stunning views of the lake and surrounding landscapes, providing a tranquil setting for exercise enthusiasts and nature lovers alike.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-06-11 |title=Hamilton Lake, best lake for Hamilton City, top 5 lakes |url=https://hamiltonnz.co.nz/hamilton-lake/ |access-date=2024-11-05 |website=hamiltonnz.co.nz |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Climate===
Hamilton's climate is [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] (Köppen: Cfb ), with highly moderated temperatures due to New Zealand's location surrounded by ocean. As the largest inland city in the country, winters are cool and mornings can feature the lowest temperatures of the North Island's main centres, dropping as low as {{convert|-3|°C|°F|abbr=on}} several times per year, experiencing on average 17.1 nights that drop below freezing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cliflo.niwa.co.nz/|title=CliFlo -The National Climate Database (Agent numbers: 26117)|publisher=NIWA |access-date=17 Aug 2024 }}</ref> Nighttime temperatures are even cooler outside of the city. Likewise, summers can be some of the warmest in the country with on average 51.6 days with temperatures exceeding {{convert|25|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cliflo.niwa.co.nz/|title=CliFlo -The National Climate Database (Agent numbers: 26117)|publisher=NIWA |access-date=17 Aug 2024 }}</ref> Hamilton also features very high humidity (similar to tropical climates such as [[Singapore]]) which can make temperatures feel much higher or lower than they are.
Ground frosts are common and snow is possible but rare. The only recorded snowfall in modern times was light snowflakes in mid-August 2011 during a prolonged cold period that saw snowfall as far north as [[Dargaville]].<ref name="hamiltonsnow">{{cite web | url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/5447294/Snow-in-Hamilton | title=Snow in Hamilton | date=15 August 2011 }}</ref>

Hamilton receives considerable precipitation amounting to around 1,100&nbsp;mm over 125 days per year. This coupled with annual sunshine hours of around 2,000 makes Hamilton and the surrounding [[Waikato]] an extremely fertile region.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

Typically summers are dry and winters are wet. Fog is common during winter mornings, especially close to the [[Waikato River]] which runs through the city centre. Hamilton is one of the foggiest cities on earth, however, fog usually burns off by noon to produce sunny and calm winter days.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Foggiest Places on Earth|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/foggiest-places-on-earth.html|access-date=13 February 2021|website=WorldAtlas|date=27 February 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

Hamilton also has the lowest average wind speed of New Zealand's main centres as a result of its inland location, in a depression surrounded by high hills and mountains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.niwa.co.nz/sites/default/files/import/attachments/summary.xls|title=Climate description summary|website=niwa.co.nz|access-date=26 September 2023}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:WaikatoUni.jpg|thumb|[[University of Waikato]] campus]]
Education and research are important to the city—Hamilton is home to two institutes of higher education, the [[University of Waikato]] and the [[Waikato Institute of Technology]] (Wintec). Research at the Ruakura research centres have been responsible for much of New Zealand's innovation in agriculture. Hamilton's main revenue source is the dairy industry, due to its location in the centre of New Zealand's largest dairying area.

Hamilton annually hosts the National Agricultural [[Fieldays]] at Mystery Creek, the southern hemisphere's biggest agricultural trade exhibition. Mystery Creek is the country's largest event centre and hosts other events of national importance, such as [[Parachute music festival|Parachute Christian Music Festival]], the National Car Show and the National Boat Show.

Manufacturing and retail are also important to the local economy, as is the provision of health services through the Waikato Hospital. The city is home to New Zealand's largest aircraft manufacturer, [[Pacific Aerospace]], which manufactured its 1,000th aircraft in August 2009, and previously [[Micro Aviation NZ]] which manufactured and exported high-quality [[microlight]] aircraft.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/79388118/Family-of-the-late-microlight-pioneer-Max-Clear-put-his-Te-Kowhai-airfield-up-for-sale|title=Micro Aviation and Te Kowhai Airfield to be sold|date=30 May 2016|work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]]|language=en|last=Winter|first=Chloe}}</ref> It also has its largest concentration of trailer-boat manufacturers such as Buccaneer.

It will also, as expressed in a City Council report, "undermine the attractiveness of public transport as a mode of choice for many years to come."<ref>{{Cite web|date=14 October 2021|title=Waikato Public Transport Business Improvement Review|url=https://www.southwaikato.govt.nz/repository/libraries/id:24rtvarkd17q9s3wxfnn/hierarchy/our-council/agenda-and-minutes/documents/Attachment%20to%20Rept%206.7%20WRC-Public-Transport-Business-Improvement-Review%20-%2024%20Feb%202022.pdf|website=South Waikato District Council|access-date=1 June 2022|archive-date=7 March 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220307080230/https://www.southwaikato.govt.nz/repository/libraries/id%3A24rtvarkd17q9s3wxfnn/hierarchy/our-council/agenda-and-minutes/documents/Attachment%20to%20Rept%206.7%20WRC-Public-Transport-Business-Improvement-Review%20-%2024%20Feb%202022.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Hamilton Ring Road project was initiated to free some of the city's streets from peak-traffic congestion and improve connectivity around the city. It consists of five segments, opening between 1963 and 2024. It was linked to the Te Rapa Section of the Waikato Expressway in 2012.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hamilton.govt.nz/our-city/city-news/Documents/2015/2015-10-citynews.pdf|title=City News – Driving a great road and biking network|date=Oct 2015|website=Hamilton City Council|access-date=22 April 2020|archive-date=24 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124211112/https://www.hamilton.govt.nz/our-city/city-news/Documents/2015/2015-10-citynews.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Hamilton City Council removed funding from its 2024-2034 Long Term Plan to widen many sections of the road, which included the construction of new bus priority and transit lanes.

In 2017, it was noted that a drop in passenger numbers on the [[Public transport in Hamilton and Waikato#Hamilton City routes|Orbiter]] bus correlated with opening of the extension to Cambridge Rd in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://envirolink.govt.nz/assets/WRC/Community/Council-Meetings-and-Agendas/Hamilton-public-transport-joint-committee/2017/FULL-FINAL-AGENDA-Hamilton-Public-Transport-2-June-2017.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201127074328/https://envirolink.govt.nz/assets/WRC/Community/Council-Meetings-and-Agendas/Hamilton-public-transport-joint-committee/2017/FULL-FINAL-AGENDA-Hamilton-Public-Transport-2-June-2017.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=27 November 2020|title=Hamilton Public Transport Joint Committee Agenda|date=2 June 2017}}</ref>

* [[Fairfield Bridge]]
* [[Whitiora Bridge]]
* [[Claudelands Bridge]]
* [[Victoria Bridge, Hamilton|Victoria Bridge]]
* [[Cobham Bridge]]
* [[Peacocke Bridge]] planned opening mid 2024

In addition to the road bridges within the city, the [[Horotiu#Bridges|Horotiu bridge]] is located approximately 10&nbsp;km north of the city centre and the [[New Zealand State Highway 21#Narrows Bridge|Narrows Bridge]] approximately 10&nbsp;km to the south.

The river is also crossed by a rail bridge and a pedestrian bridge:
* [[Claudelands Bridge|Claudelands Rail Bridge]]
* Pukete – Flagstaff Pedestrian / Sewer Bridge (see [[#Sewage|Sewage section]] below)

==== Buses ====
{{Main|Public transport in Hamilton and Waikato}}Hamilton has buses linking the CBD to most of its suburbs. It also has three high-frequency bus services named Orbiter, Comet and the newly created Meteor service. The Orbiter service loops Hamilton City in both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions connecting Rotokauri Transport Hub, Rototuna, Chartwell, University, CBD South, Hospital, Dinsdale and Wintec Rotokauri Campus.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.busit.co.nz/hamilton-routes/orbiter/ |access-date=2024-07-03 |website=www.busit.co.nz}}</ref> The Comet service runs north to south and vice-versa connecting the southern suburbs to the Hospital, CBD, Transport Centre, Te Rapa and The Base shopping centre. The Meteor service runs east to west and vice-versa connecting the south-eastern suburbs to the University, Hamilton East, CBD, Transport Centre, western suburbs, Wintec Rotokauri and the Rotokauri Transport Hub. The high frequency buses run every 15 minutes during peak times.

===Rail===

==== Stations ====
{{main|Hamilton Railway Station, New Zealand|Hamilton Central railway station, Waikato}}
Hamilton City has two railway stations, both servicing the Auckland to Waikato train service, [[Te Huia]]. The [[Rotokauri railway station|Rotokauri station]] (also known as the [[Rotokauri Transport Hub]]) is located in [[Rotokauri]] behind The Base shopping centre in Hamilton North. The main [[Hamilton railway station, New Zealand|Hamilton station]] is located in [[Frankton, Hamilton|Frankton]] at the junction of the [[East Coast Main Trunk Railway|East Coast Main Trunk]] line (ECMT) and the [[North Island Main Trunk]] line (NIMT). [[Hamilton Central railway station, Waikato|A disused platform on the ECMT]] lies beneath the [[Central business district|CBD]].<ref>Source:Waikato museum photo</ref>

In 2006, a study was done into a [[Waikato Connection#Potential reintroduction|possible re-introduction of daily commuter train services to Auckland]] and the benefits that might flow from it.<ref>{{cite web |last=Richard Paling and Ross Rutherford |date=July 2006 |title=HAMILTON – AUCKLAND COMMUTER RAIL SERVICE FEASIBILITY STUDY Final Report |url=http://www.ew.govt.nz/PageFiles/2322/hamiltonToAucklandCommuterRailStudy.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216172028/http://www.ew.govt.nz/PageFiles/2322/hamiltonToAucklandCommuterRailStudy.pdf |archive-date=16 December 2010 |website=www.ew.govt.nz}}</ref> The new service, dubbed [[Te Huia]], commenced on 6 April 2021.

==== Freight ====
Hamilton's rail network serves as a major hub for the distribution of dairy products to the ports of Auckland and Tauranga. This hub is located on Crawford St, on land that was formerly part of the [[Te Rapa#Te Rapa Marshalling Yard|Te Rapa Marshalling Yard]], just north of the locomotive depot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/PageFiles/10756/Fonterra%20Crawford%20St%20Fuel%20Efficiencies.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304135354/http://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/PageFiles/10756/Fonterra%20Crawford%20St%20Fuel%20Efficiencies.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Fuel efficiency impacts of Fonterra's Crawford St Dairy Freight Hub|archive-date=4 March 2016}}</ref> Te Rapa is at the northern end of the 25 kV AC 50&nbsp;Hz electrification between Hamilton and [[Palmerston North]].

==== Preserved stock ====
Hamilton also has two locomotives on display:
* [[NZR F class]] 230 was donated by [[Ellis and Burnand|Ellis & Burnand]], the central North Island sawmillers, in 1956 for static display. Formerly used as the yard engine at their Mangapehi sawmill, it was placed on display at Lake Rotoroa and its boiler filled with concrete. This engine has become a 0-4-2ST in later years following the loss of her rear coupling rod.
* NZR D<sup>SA</sup> 230 (TMS DSA359), a 0-6-0DM diesel shunting locomotive built by English Electric for the Drewry Car Company, was withdrawn in 1986 and placed on display at Frankton minus its Gardner 8L3 diesel engine and transmission. It was moved in the early 2000s with its shelter to [[Forest Lake, New Zealand#Minogue Park|Minogue Park]], where it was united with an open seating wagon built on the underframe of wagon W 960, built in 1946 and converted to Way & Works wagon E 7784 in April 1966.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nzrsr.co.nz/view_page.php?page=4&search=false&sort=none&order=none|title=New Zealand Rolling Stock Register|website=www.nzrsr.co.nz|access-date=6 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602213514/http://www.nzrsr.co.nz/view_page.php?page=4&search=false&sort=none&order=none|archive-date=2 June 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====The railway settlement====
From the arrival of the railway in Hamilton, Frankton was a [[railway town]]. In 1923, the suburb became even more railway-orientated when the Frankton Junction Railway House Factory opened, producing the famous [[George Troup (architect)|George Troup]] designed railway houses sent to many North Island railway settlements, which are now sought-after pieces of real estate. Its 60 workers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historic.org.nz/~/media/Corporate/Files/Publications/AdaptiveReuse.ashx |title=photos and information about NZHPT restoration }}</ref> produced almost 1400 pre-fabricated railway houses at a peak rate of 400 a year, using rimu and matai from the railway's central North Island forests. When, in 1926, government cuts reduced the need for railway houses, the factory also started to supply houses for local councils.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://atojs.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/atojs?a=d&d=AJHR1926-I.1.1867|title=AtoJs Online — Appendix to the Journals of the House of Representatives — 1926 Session I — D-02 Page XVIII|website=atojs.natlib.govt.nz|language=en-NZ|access-date=10 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190504013144/https://atojs.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/atojs?a=d|archive-date=4 May 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Those supplied to [[Waiwhetū|Lower Hutt]] were claimed to be £500 cheaper than comparable houses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP19260202.2.71|title=Hutt Settlement|date=2 February 1926|work=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]]|access-date=10 May 2018|pages=8}}</ref> The sawmill also produced everything else such as signal masts and boxes, bridges, sleepers, and even furniture for railway stations. It was too efficient for private builders, who got the housing factory closed in 1929. When it finally closed in the 1990s it was very dilapidated, but [[NZHPT]] supported restoration of the Category 1 historic place, retaining original windows, big sliding doors and the saw-tooth roof.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historic.org.nz/theregister/registersearch/RegisterResults.aspx?RID=4946 |title=NZHPT listing, photo and details |publisher=Historic.org.nz }}</ref> It is now home to a range of businesses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/37B1C25E-5023-4D90-9E64-AC76B6242A90/88906/DBHOH_PAP_16049_5674.pdf|title=NZHPT Annual Report 2007}}{{Dead link|date=October 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Frankton also was home to the Way and Works depot, still in operation as the KiwiRail Network depot. This was connected to the main line by a short siding that ran past the factory; this line was last used in 1997 when a shunting locomotive retrieved two flat wagons from the Way and Works depot. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The railway workers' community was centred largely around the W&W depot and sawmill, containing some 200 houses and a Railways Social Hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historic.org.nz/theregister/registersearch/RegisterResults.aspx?RID=7014 |title=NZHPT listing, map and details of suburb |publisher=Historic.org.nz |date=27 October 1994}}</ref> Many of the houses are still in place, the majority being the classic 90sq<sup>2</sup> three-bedroom design used as standard across New Zealand for railway staff.<ref>There were two sizes of Railway houses, the classic 90sq<sup>2</sup> and the larger 100sq<sup>2</sup> which was for management only. All were three-bedroom structures, and came with a choice of six different front porches.</ref>

==Education==
{{See also|List of schools in Waikato, New Zealand#Hamilton City}}
Hamilton is home to more than 40,000 tertiary students, mostly enrolled in one of the city's three main tertiary institutes; the [[University of Waikato]], [[Waikato Institute of Technology]] and [[Te Wananga o Aotearoa]]. The city is also home to 53 schools both private and state-owned.

As well as state and private primary, intermediate and high schools, it also notably includes a number of [[Māori language revival|Kura Kaupapa Māori]] primary schools offering education in the Māori language.

The city has seven state secondary schools, in a clockwise direction from north: Rototuna High School in Rototuna,  [[Fairfield College]] in Fairfield, [[Hamilton Boys' High School]] in Hamilton East, [[Hillcrest High School (New Zealand)|Hillcrest High School]] in Silverdale, [[Melville High School]] in Melville, [[Hamilton Girls' High School]] in the central city, and [[Fraser High School, New Zealand|Fraser High School]] in Nawton.

[[File:Sewer bridge at Tauhara Gully, Hamilton.jpg|thumb|Prestressed concrete box girder bridge over Kirikiriroa Stream at Tauhara Gully. Photo 2015.]]
The trunk lines needed a {{convert|165|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} bridge, about {{convert|14|m|abbr=on}} above the Waikato, another prestressed concrete [[box girder bridge]] over Kirikiriroa Stream at Tauhara Gully and 2 steel pipe bridges over other gullies. The River bridge was designed by Murray-North Partners and the others by council engineers.<ref name="HCSS" />

The Pukete sewage works cost $12.5m ($160m at 2015 prices). It now cleans {{convert|40|e6L}}/day, which is aerated for about 2 hours in a [[Sewage treatment#Primary treatment|sedimentation tank]], [[Sewage treatment#Disinfection|disinfected with chlorine]], [[Sulfur dioxide#As a reducing agent|dechlorinated with sulphur dioxide]] and discharged into the Waikato through a diffuser [[outfall]] on the river bed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ecotox.org.au/aje/archives/vol11p149.pdf |title=Australasian Journal of Ecotoxicology Vol. 11, Pp. 149–154, 2005 |access-date=16 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227123447/http://ecotox.org.au/aje/archives/vol11p149.pdf |archive-date=27 February 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[Beca Group|CH2M Beca]], successor to the previous engineers, upgraded the plant from 1998 to 2002 to improve nitrogen, [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]] and suspended solids levels, with a change from chlorination to [[Disinfectant|UV treatment]] and biogas and natural gas {{convert|1.5|e6W}} [[Cogeneration#Types of plants|cogeneration units]], able to power the treatment processes and export surplus to the grid.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ch2mbeca.com/projects/pukete_waste_water_treatment_plant.aspx |title=CH2M Beca project summary |access-date=16 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016140004/http://www.ch2mbeca.com/projects/pukete_waste_water_treatment_plant.aspx |archive-date=16 October 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

A further 5 year upgrade started about 2009 expanding and improving the plant, including phosphorus removal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hamilton.govt.nz/our-city/city-projects/puketewastewatertreatmentplant/Pages/default.aspx|title=Pukete Wastewater Treatment Plant|access-date=14 July 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123071426/http://www.hamilton.govt.nz/our-city/city-projects/puketewastewatertreatmentplant/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=23 January 2015}}</ref>

Despite the improvements there have been on-going problems. In 2012 the council was prosecuted for a sewage sludge spill<ref>[http://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/Community/Whats-happening/News/Media-releases-archived/HCC-to-be-prosecuted-over-Pukete-sewage-spill/ Regional Council media release – sewage prosecution 23 Jan 2012]</ref> and consent conditions were breached in 2013 due to a bacterial problem.<ref name="404 - Hamilton City Council" /> In 2014 up to {{convert|800|m3|impgal|abbr=on}} of untreated sewage got into the river.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/news/10180096/Pollution-double-standard|title=Pollution 'double standard'|first=Aaron|last=Leaman|date=20 June 2014|access-date=14 July 2016|via=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]]}}</ref>

There are also problems with pumping stations. Out of over 130, up to 20 fail each month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/71859654/forbidden-flushes-keep-staff-busy-at-hamiltons-wastewater-treatment-plant|title=Forbidden flushes strain city network|date=8 September 2015|access-date=14 July 2016}}</ref>

===Electricity===
Hamilton was also late in getting electricity. [[Reefton Power Station|Reefton]] had electricity from 1888. Some Hamiltonians had their own [[Dynamo#Practical designs|dynamos]] from about 1912, the year the first licence was given for building lines and a generating plant in the Frankton Town Board area. It cost over £8,000 (about $1.3m in 2017 prices)<ref name=":3" /> for the initial network, powered by two {{convert|45|kW|abbr=on}} [[Direct current|DC]] [[Brush Electrical Machines|Brush]] generators in Kent St, driven by two 4-cylinder {{convert|90|hp|abbr=on}} suction [[gas engine]]s (suction gas engines used low pressure gas from coal<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ipenz.org.nz/heritage/conference/papers/churchward_m.pdf |title=see page 10 'Gas Engines in Victorian Industry, 1870–1950' |access-date=26 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102162411/http://www.ipenz.org.nz/heritage/conference/papers/churchward_m.pdf |archive-date=2 January 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>), which started on 23 April 1913 (officially opened by Prime Minister [[William Massey|Massey]] on 4 June). Lighting was provided for streets, houses and the Empire Hotel in Frankton, initially only from 7.30am to 5pm, using a labourer, a meter reader and two linesmen. Electricity was sold at 10d (2015 equivalent $15) per kWh. The first Chief Electrical Engineer was Mr A Beale, followed by [[Lloyd Mandeno]], (1913–1916) and Israel (Jack) Webster, who stayed for nearly 40 years. From May 1916, Hamilton was connected and, in 1917, the supply area was widened to a 5-mile radius and an {{convert|80|kW|abbr=on}} and then two more {{convert|45|kW|abbr=on}} sets were added at Kent St.<ref name="WEL">Wiring up the Waikato published by WEL Networks research by Chris Gilson</ref> Despite this, by 1920, Frankton was unable to cope with demand. The [[Mayor of Hamilton, New Zealand#List of Mayors of Hamilton|mayor]], P H Watts, proposed buying a second-hand steam plant for £17,000, but it was rejected at a poll on 23 April 1920. The mayor, 6 councillors and the electricity staff all resigned.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ketehamilton.peoplesnetworknz.info/hamilton_heritage/topics/show/388-struggle-for-power-the-hamilton-election-of-1920 |title=Struggle for Power : The Hamilton Election of 1920 |access-date=26 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094228/http://ketehamilton.peoplesnetworknz.info/hamilton_heritage/topics/show/388-struggle-for-power-the-hamilton-election-of-1920 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The problem was resolved by a link to [[Horahora Power Station]] completed, like Frankton, in 1913. In 1919 it was bought by the government and, by 1921, an 11 kV AC line linked it to Hamilton.,<ref name="WEL" /> allowing the "noisy, smoky", Kent St power station to close in July 1922,<ref>Waikato Times 8 October 1960 page 14 'Hamilton's first electric generating plant'</ref> by which time it was rated at 170&nbsp;kW.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/parliamentary/appendix-to-the-journals-of-the-house-of-representatives/1922/I/1354|title=Appendix to the Journals of the House of Representatives 1922 Session PUBLIC WORKS STATEMENT BY THE HON.

There were over 1,500 connections in Hamilton by 1923. [[Undergrounding]] began in 1926, when the 11 kV cable was extended from Peachgrove Rd to Seddon Rd sub-station. By 1928 the council had 3,381 consumers and charges were down to 6d per kWh for lighting and 2d per kWh for power and heating. By 1935 4,458 were connected, with {{convert|55|mi|abbr=on}} of line and lighting was down another penny. By 1950, the 11 kV rings in Hamilton East and Claudelands were finished. Soon afterwards [[Mercury-vapor lamp|mercury vapor street lighting]] was installed in London Street and Norton Rd. 33kV gas- and oil-filled cables were laid from 1960 and switched on in April 1974. By 1987 there were 12,247 connections, {{convert|291|km|abbr=on}} of line and charges down to 6.577c/kWh<ref name="WEL" /> (about 13c in 2015 prices). In 2015 prices varied from 11.31 to 22.92 cents per kWh.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.genesisenergy.co.nz/for-home/pricing-plans/electricity-pricing-plans/hamilton-and-outlying-areas|title = Genesis price list for Hamilton|date = October 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160102162412/https://www.genesisenergy.co.nz/for-home/pricing-plans/electricity-pricing-plans/hamilton-and-outlying-areas|archive-date = 2 January 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref>

[[List of Statutes of New Zealand (1984–90)|Legislation]] in 1988 amalgamated the Central Waikato Electric Power Board with Hamilton's Electricity Division from April 1989 as Waikato Electricity Limited,<ref name="WEL" /> now known as [[WEL Networks]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wel.co.nz/Meet-WEL-Networks/The-WEL-Networks-Story/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151109002415/http://www.wel.co.nz/Meet-WEL-Networks/The-WEL-Networks-Story|url-status=dead|title=The WEL Networks story|archive-date=9 November 2015}}</ref> one of the [[Electricity sector in New Zealand|distribution]] companies.

Hamilton now has a 220kV link to the [[National Grid (New Zealand)|National Grid]] and [[Transpower New Zealand|Transpower]] provides for a peak load of 187MW, expected to rise to 216MW by 2030.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.transpower.co.nz/sites/default/files/uncontrolled_docs/TPR2015CompleteFINAL.pdf |title=Transpower 2015 plans (with maps) |access-date=26 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102162412/https://www.transpower.co.nz/sites/default/files/uncontrolled_docs/TPR2015CompleteFINAL.pdf |archive-date=2 January 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
