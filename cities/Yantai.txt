'''Yantai''', [[Postal Map Romanization|formerly]] [[romanization of Chinese|known]] as '''Chefoo''', is a coastal [[prefecture-level city]] on the [[Shandong Peninsula]] in northeastern [[Shandong province]] of the [[People's Republic of China]].  Lying on the southern coast of the [[Bohai Strait]], Yantai borders [[Qingdao]] on the southwest and [[Weihai]] on the east, with sea access to both the [[Bohai Sea]] (via the [[Laizhou Bay]] and the Bohai Strait) and the [[Yellow Sea]] (from both north and south sides of the Shandong Peninsula).  It is the largest [[fishing industry in China|fishing seaport]] in Shandong.  Its population was 7,102,116 during the [[2020 Chinese census|2020 census]], of whom 3,184,299 lived in the built-up area made up of the 5 [[district (China)|urban districts]] of [[Zhifu District|Zhifu]], [[Laishan District|Laishan]], [[Fushan District|Fushan]], [[Muping District|Muping]], and [[Penglai District|Penglai]].

{{anchor|Etymology|Name}}

== Names ==
The name '''Yantai''' (<small>{{abbr|lit|literally}}.</small>{{nbsp}}"[[Smoke]] [[Chinese pagoda|Tower]]") derives from the watchtowers constructed on {{nowrap|[[Mount Qi]]}} in 1398 under the reign of the [[Hongwu Emperor]] of the [[Ming dynasty]]. The towers were used to light signal fires and send [[smoke signal]]s, called ''langyan'' from their supposed use of [[wolf]] [[Feces|dung]] for fuel. At the time, the area was troubled by the Japanese pirates ([[Wokou]]), initially raiders from the [[Sengoku period|warring states]] in Japan but later principally disaffected Chinese. It was also formerly romanized as '''Yen-tai'''.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}

The major district of Yantai is [[Zhifu]], which used to be the largest independent city in the area. It was variously romanized as '''Chefoo'''{{NoteTag|[[Postal Map Romanization]]}}, '''Che-foo''',{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} '''Chi-fu''',{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=132}} and '''Chih-fou'''. Although this name was used for the city by foreigners prior to the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist]] victory in the [[Chinese Civil War]], the locals referred to the settlement as Yantai throughout.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=132}}

== History ==
[[File:MoonBay.jpg|left|200px|thumb|[[Moon Bay (Yantai)|Moon Bay]] in Yantai]]

During the [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] and [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] [[list of Chinese dynasties|dynasties]], the region was inhabited by indigenous people vaguely known to the [[Huaxia|Chinese]] as the "[[Dongyi|Eastern Barbarians]]" (''Dongyi''). Under the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]], they were colonized and [[sinification|sinicized]] as the [[state of Lai]]. Lai was annexed by [[state of Qi|Qi]] in {{nowrap|567 BC.}} Under the [[Qin Shihuang|First Emperor]] (''Shi Huangdi''), the area was administered as the [[Qi Commandery]]. Under the [[Han dynasty|Han]], this was renamed as the [[Donglai Commandery]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|東|萊|郡}}}}). Following the [[Three Kingdoms period]], the area was organized by the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin]] as the Donglai [[wang (title)|Kingdom or Principality]], later returning to [[prefecture (China)|prefecture]] status as a [[Jun (administrative division)|''jùn'']] and then ''[[zhou (administrative subdivision)|zhōu]]''. Under the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]], it was known as [[Deng Prefecture (Shandong)|Deng Prefecture]] and organized with the [[Henan Circuit]]. It was then organized as the [[Laizhou Commandery|Laizhou]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|萊|州|府}}}}) and then, under the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], [[Dengzhou Prefecture]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|登|州|府}}}}).

Up to the 19th century, however, the Zhifu area consisted of nothing but small [[Chinese city wall|unwalled]] fishing [[village (China)|villages]] of little importance.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} Under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]], these were first troubled by the [[Wokou]] and then by the overreacting [[Haijin|"Sea Ban"]], which required coastal Chinese to give up trading and most fishing and relocate inland upon pain of death.

Following the [[Second Opium War]], the [[Qing Empire]] was obliged to open more [[treaty ports]] by the [[unequal treaties|unequal]] 1858 [[Treaty of Tianjin]], including Tengchow (now [[Penglai, Shandong|Penglai]]). Its port being found inadequate, Zhifu—about {{convert|30|mi|sp=us}} away—was selected to act as the seat of the area's foreign commerce.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} The mooring was at considerable distance from shore, necessitating more time and expense in loading and unloading, but the harbor was deep and expansive and business grew rapidly.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} The harbor opened in May 1861, with its status as an international port affirmed on 22 August. The official decree was accompanied by the construction of the [[Donghai Customs House]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|東海|關}}}}).<ref name=qq/> It quickly became the residence of a [[circuit intendant]] ("taotai"), [[Chinese Maritime Customs Service|customs house]], and a considerable foreign settlement located between the old native town and the harbor.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and sixteen other nations established [[consulate]]s in the town.<ref name=qq>{{citation |script-title=zh:烟台概览：烟台名称源于烟台山 |url=http://news.qq.com/a/20080619/001784.htm |work=QQ News |date=19 June 2008 |access-date=19 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115104611/http://news.qq.com/ |archive-date=15 November 2012 |url-status=live |language=zh-cn}}</ref> The town was initially expanded with well-laid streets and well-built stone houses, even for the poorer classes, a [[Catholicism in China|Catholic]] and a [[Protestantism in China|Protestant]] church were erected, and a large hotel did business with foreigners who employed the town as a summer resort.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}
[[File:Yantai - Old German Post Office.jpg|left|thumb|Original German Post Office in Yantai's old town]]
The principal traders were the British and Americans, followed by the [[German Empire|Germans]] and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Thais]].{{NoteTag|In 1872, 233 British vessels entered the port with 97,239 tons of cargo valued at £144,887 and 348 ships of all other nationalities entered with 149,197 tons of cargo valued at £177,168.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}}} In the 1870s, the principal imports were [[woolen]] and [[cotton]] goods, [[iron]], and [[History of opium in China|opium]] and the principal exports were [[tofu]], [[soybean oil]], [[pea]]s, coarse [[vermicelli]], [[vegetable]]s, and [[dried fruit]] from Zhifu itself, [[raw silk]] and [[straw braid]] from [[Laizhou]], and [[walnut]]s from [[Qingzhou]]. The town also traded [[Chinese liquor]]s and sundries for the edible [[seaweed]] grown in the shallows of the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] settlements around [[Port Arthur, China|Port Arthur]] (now [[Dalian]]'s [[Lüshunkou District]]).{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} In 1875, the murder of the British diplomat [[Augustus Margary]] in [[Tengchong]], [[Yunnan]], led to a [[Margary Affair|diplomatic crisis]] that was resolved in Zhifu by [[Sir Thomas Wade|Thomas Wade]] and [[Li Hongzhang]] the next year.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=133}} The resultant [[Chefoo Convention]] gave British subjects [[extraterritoriality]] throughout China and exempted the foreign merchants' enclaves from the [[Likin (taxation)|likin]] tax on internal commerce. Its healthy situation and good anchorage made it a favorite [[coaling station]] for foreign fleets, giving it some importance in the conflicts over Korea, Port Arthur, and Weihaiwei.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=133}}

On 12 November 1911, the eastern division of [[Tongmeng Hui]] declared itself a part of the revolutionary movement. The next day, it established the Shandong Military Government ({{lang|zh-hant|山東軍政府}}) and, the day after that, renamed itself the Yantai Division of the Shandong Military Government ({{lang|zh-hant|山東煙台軍政分府}}). In 1914, Jiaodong [[Circuit (political division)|Circuit]] ({{lang|zh-hant|膠東道}}) was established with Yantai as the capital. Jiaodong Circuit was renamed Donghai Circuit ({{lang|zh-hant|東海道}}) in 1925. On 19 January 1938, Yantai participated as part of an anti-Japanese revolutionary committee.

After the creation of the [[People's Republic of China]], Yantai was officially awarded city status with the outlying towns of [[Laiyang]] and [[Wendeng]] tacked on as "Special Regions" ({{lang|zh-Hans|专区}}) in 1950. Wendeng was merged into Laiyang six years later, and this larger Laiyang Special Region was combined with Yantai City to become Yantai Prefecture ({{lang|zh-Hans|烟台地区}}). Yantai is of strategic importance to China's defense, as it and [[Dalian]], directly across the [[Bohai Sea]] from it, are primary coastal guard points for [[Beijing]]. In November 1983, the prefecture became a [[prefecture-level city]].<ref>{{cite news |script-title=zh:优越的地理环境及人文历史造成就旅游圣地烟台 |url = http://yantai.dzwww.com/xinwen/xwzt/2005sdxzt/xw/xwbd/200504/t20050424_1042544.htm |access-date=19 November 2012 |date=24 July 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140418220504/http://yantai.dzwww.com/xinwen/xwzt/2005sdxzt/xw/xwbd/200504/t20050424_1042544.htm |archive-date=18 April 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Txu-oclc-10552568-nj51-9-back.jpg|left|thumb|Map of Yantai (labeled as YEN-T'AI (CHEFOO))]]
Yantai is located along the north coast of the [[Shandong Peninsula]], south of the junction of [[Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea]] and parallel to the southern coast of [[Liaoning]]. The topographical breakdown consists of:
* 36.62% mountainous
* 39.7% hilly
* 50.23% plain
* 2.90% basin
About {{convert|2643.60|km2|abbr=on}} is urbanized. Only Qixia City is located entirely inland. All other county-level entities are coastal, with [[Changdao County|Changdao]] consisting entirely of islands. The total coastline of the prefecture is {{convert|909|km|sp=us}}.

The summits in the hill country vary from {{convert|100|-|300|m|sp=us}}; the average peak in the mountainous region is {{convert|500|m|sp=us}}, and the highest point of elevation is the summit of [[Mount Kunyu]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|昆|崳|山}}}}) at {{convert|922.8|m|sp=us}}.

There are 121 rivers over {{convert|5|km|sp=us}} in length, the largest being:
* Wulong River ({{lang|zh-Hans|五龙河}})
* [[Dagu River]] ({{lang|zh-Hans|大沽河}})
* Dagujia River ({{lang|zh-Hans|大沽夹河}})
* Wang River ({{lang|zh-Hans|王河}})
* Jie River ({{lang|zh-Hans|界河}})
* Huangshui River ({{lang|zh-Hans|黄水河}})
* Xin'an River ({{lang|zh-Hans|辛安河}})
The core of the old town of Zhifu was located above the mouth of the [[Yi River (Shandong)|Yi]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|沂|河}}}}, ''Yí Hé'').{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}

===Climate===
Yantai has a monsoon-influenced climate which under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Yantai falls within either a [[hot-summer humid continental climate]] (''Dwa'') if the {{convert|0|°C}} isotherm is used or a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cwa'') if the {{convert|-3|°C}} isotherm is used. Summers are hot, humid, and rainy while winters are cold and dry. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from {{convert|−12.8|°C|0}} (unofficial record of {{convert|−15|°C|0}} was set on 10 January 1931) to {{convert|38|°C|0}}.<ref>{{Cite web |title=中国各地城市的历史最低气温 |url=https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309404203050792315805 |access-date=2024-09-15 |website=weibo.com}}</ref>
