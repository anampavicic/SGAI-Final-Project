The '''Andaman and Nicobar Islands''' is a [[union territory]] of [[India]] comprising 836 islands, of which only 31 are inhabited. These islands are grouped into two main clusters: the northern [[Andaman Islands]] and the southern [[Nicobar Islands]], separated by a {{cvt|150|km}} wide [[Ten Degree Channel|channel]]. The capital and largest city of the territory, [[Port Blair]] (officially Sri Vijaya Puram), is located approximately {{cvt|1,190|km}} from [[Chennai]] and {{cvt|1,255|km}} from [[Kolkata]] in [[mainland India]]. The islands are situated between the [[Bay of Bengal]] to the west and the [[Andaman Sea]] to the east. The northernmost point is {{cvt|901|km}} from the mouth of the [[Hooghly River]]. [[Indira Point]], located at 6°45’10″N and 93°49’36″E on the southern tip of [[Great Nicobar]], is the southernmost point of India.

The territory shares [[maritime border]]s with [[Indonesia]] located about {{cvt|165|km}} to the south, [[Myanmar]] located {{cvt|280|km}} to the north-east and [[Thailand]] located {{cvt|650|km}} to the south-east. The islands occupy a total land area of approximately {{cvt|8249|km2}} with a population of 380,581 as per the [[2011 Census of India|2011 census]]. The territory is divided into three districts: [[Nicobar District|Nicobar]], [[South Andaman district|South Andaman]], and [[North and Middle Andaman district|North and Middle Andaman]] with the capitals at [[Car Nicobar]], Port Blair and [[Mayabunder]] respectively.

Genetic and cultural studies suggest that the indigenous Andamanese people may have been isolated from other populations during the [[Middle Paleolithic]] era, more than 30,000 years ago. Archeological evidence of civilisation has been dated back to 2,200 years. In the 11th century CE, [[Cholas]], one of the [[Three Crowned Kings|three Tamil kingdoms]], used the islands as a [[naval base]] to launch expeditions in South East Asia. The [[Danish East India Company|Danish]] were the first Europeans to arrive on the islands in 1755. The islands became part of the [[British Raj]] in 1868. During the [[Second World War]], the islands were invaded by the [[Japanese Empire]]. After [[Indian Independence Act 1947|Indian Independence]] in 1947, the region became a province and later a union territory after the adoption of the [[Constitution of India]] in 1950.

The islands host the [[Andaman and Nicobar Command]], the only geographical command operated jointly by the three major wings of the [[Indian Armed Forces]]: the [[Indian Army|Army]], the [[Indian Air Force|Air Force]] and the [[Indian Navy|Navy]]. While [[Hindi]] and English are the official languages, the major spoken languages include [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. Indigenous people speak any of the [[Andamanese languages|Andamanese]] or [[Nicobarese languages|Nicobarese]] family of languages. [[Hinduism]] is the majority religion in the union territory, with a significant Christian minority. The islands include the [[North Sentinel Island]], home to the [[Sentinelese people]], an [[uncontacted people|uncontacted tribe]].

==Etymology==
The name Andaman might have been derived from ''Handuman'', after the Indian God [[Hanuman]] from the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] epic [[Ramayana]].<ref name="SA">{{cite web |url=https://southandaman.nic.in/history/ |title=History of South Andaman |publisher=[[Government of India]] |access-date=1 December 2023}}</ref> The place was called with a similar name by the [[Malay people|Malay]], who used to be involved in [[History of slavery|slave trade]] in the region.<ref name="NA">{{cite web |url=https://northmiddle.andaman.nic.in/history/ |title=History of North Andaman |publisher=[[Government of India]] |access-date=1 December 2023}}</ref> The place was also referred by various names such as ''Angademan'' by [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century CE and ''Angamanian'' by [[Marco Polo]] in 13th century CE.<ref name="SA"/> Nicobar, which was located in the sea route connecting [[South India]] to [[South East Asia]], was known as ''Nakkavaram'', meaning "open/naked land" borrowed from [[Tamil language]] which later became ''Nicobar''.<ref name="NB">{{cite web |url=http://db.and.nic.in/nicobars/Profile/GeoFeat.php |title=History of Nicobar |publisher=[[Government of India]] |access-date=1 December 2023}}</ref> In the [[Middle Ages|middle ages]] (500-1500 AD), Nicobar was known as ''Lankhabatus'' in [[Arabia]], probably a mis-transcription of the name ''Nakkavaram''.
