It is located on both sides of the [[Wisłok River]] in the heartland of the [[Sandomierz Basin]]. Rzeszów is the capital of the [[Subcarpathian Voivodeship]] and the [[county seat|seat]] of [[Rzeszów County]].

The history of Rzeszów dates back to the [[Middle Ages]]. It received city rights and privileges from King [[Casimir III the Great]] in 1354. Local trade routes connecting Europe with the Middle East and the [[Ottoman Empire]] resulted in the city's early prosperity and development. In the 16th century, Rzeszów had a connection with [[Gdańsk]] and the [[Baltic Sea]].<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://www.staypoland.com/cityHistory.aspx?TownId=54|title=History of Rzeszow|first=StayPoland Sp. z|last=o.o.|access-date=28 April 2017}}</ref> It also experienced growth in commerce and craftsmanship, especially under local [[Szlachta|rulers and noblemen]]. Following the [[Partitions of Poland]], Rzeszów was annexed by the [[Austrian Empire]] and did not regain its position until it [[Second Polish Republic|returned to Poland]] after [[World War I]].

Rzeszów has found its place in the group of the most elite cities in Poland, with growing number of investments, rapid progress and a very high [[standard of living]].<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web |url=http://www.rzeszow.pl/file/14850/Rzeszow_The_Excellent_Choice_2012.pdf |title=Rzeszów excellent choice |access-date=27 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921021737/http://www.rzeszow.pl/file/14850/Rzeszow_The_Excellent_Choice_2012.pdf |archive-date=21 September 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rzeszow-news.pl/raport-o-polskich-metropoliach-jak-wypadl-w-nim-rzeszow/|title=Raport o polskich metropoliach.

==History==
In the area of Rzeszów, the first [[early European modern humans]] appeared in the [[Upper Paleolithic|late Paleolithic Age]]; archaeologists have excavated a tool made in that period at site Rzeszów 25. In the mid-6th century BC, the first farmers came to the area of the city, most likely through the [[Moravian Gate]]. Later on, Rzeszów was a settlement of the [[Lusatian culture]], which was followed by the [[Przeworsk culture]].{{fact|date=May 2024}}

In the 7th century, the first [[Slavs]] appeared in the area, which is confirmed by numerous archaeological findings.{{fact|date=May 2024}} Most probably, Rzeszów was then inhabited by the [[Vistulans]]. In the 10th century, it became part of the emerging [[Duchy of Poland (c. 960–1025)|Duchy of Poland]]. Sometime between 11th and 13th century the town was conquered and subsequently annexed by the [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] [[Ruthenians]] from the [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty#Fragmentation of the realm (1138–1320)|weakened and fragmented Polish state]] (see [[Testament of Bolesław III Krzywousty|Testament of Bolesław III Wrymouth]]).

Polish rulers of the [[Piast dynasty]] recaptured Rzeszów in 1264. In [[Tarnów]], there was a meeting of Prince [[Bolesław V the Chaste]], and Prince [[Daniel of Galicia|Daniel]] of [[Principality of Galicia|Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]], during which both sides agreed that the border would go between Rzeszów and [[Czudec]] (Rzeszów belonged to [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]], while Czudec and [[Strzyżów]] to [[Lesser Poland]]).

After the reunification of Poland following the fragmentation period, Rzeszów remained in Ruthenian hands until 1340, when King [[Casimir III the Great]] eventually recaptured the area, inviting his knights to govern the re-acquired land. According to some sources, at that time Rzeszów was inhabited by the [[Walddeutsche]], and was called Rishof (during [[World War II]], the Germans renamed it ''Reichshof''). The town was granted [[Magdeburg rights]], it had a parish church, a market place and a cemetery, and its total area was some 1,5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Magdeburg rights entitled Rzeszów's local authorities to punish criminals, build fortifications and tax merchants.

[[File:Mikołaj Spytek Ligęza.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Nobleman [[Mikołaj Spytek Ligęza]] greatly contributed to the city's importance]]
In 1458 Rzeszów was burned by the [[Vlachs]] and the [[Tatars]]. In 1502 the Tatars destroyed it again. Earlier, in 1427, Rzeszów had burned to the ground in a big fire, but the town recovered after these events, thanks to its favorable location on the main West – East ([[Kraków]] – [[Lwów]]) and North – South ([[Lublin]] – [[Slovakia]]) trade routes. In the 15th century the first [[Jew]]s settled in Rzeszów.

The 16th century was the time of prosperity for the town, especially when Rzeszów belonged to [[Mikołaj Spytek Ligęza]] (since the 1580s), who invested in infrastructure, building a castle, a Bernardine church and a monastery. Rzeszów then had some 2,500 inhabitants, with a rapidly growing Jewish community. The town was granted several royal rights, including the privilege to organise several markets a year. At that time, Rzeszów finally grew beyond its medieval borders, marked by fortifications.

[[File:WiedemannRzeszow.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rzeszów Castle]] with surroundings, by K.H. Wiedemann, 1762]]

In 1638 Rzeszów passed into the hands of the powerful and wealthy [[Lubomirski family]], becoming the center of its vast properties. At first, the town prospered and in 1658, the first college was opened there, which now operates as High School Nr 1. The period of prosperity ended, and furthermore, there were several fires and wars, which destroyed the town.

Rzeszów was first captured by the Swedes during [[Deluge (history)|The Deluge]], then by the troops of [[George II Rákóczi]] leading to the [[Treaty of Radnot]]. During the [[Great Northern War]], the Swedes again captured Rzeszów, in 1702, then several different armies occupied the town, ransacking it and destroying houses.

In the mid-eighteenth century, the town's population was composed of Poles (Roman Catholics) and Yiddish Jews in almost equal numbers (50.1% and 49.8%, respectively).<ref>J. Motylkiewicz.

=== Rzeszów under Austrian rule ===
In 1772, following the [[First Partition of Poland]], Rzeszów became part of the [[Austrian Empire]], to which it belonged for 146 years. In the late 18th century, Rzeszów had 3,000 inhabitants. By the mid-19th century, the population grew to around 7,500, with 40% of them Jewish. In 1858, the [[Galician Railway of Archduke Charles Louis]] reached Rzeszów, which resulted in further development of the town. In 1888 the first telephone lines were opened, in 1900 – gas street lamps, and in 1911 – a power plant and water system. The population grew to 23,000, with half of the inhabitants being Jews. A number of modern buildings were constructed, most of them in [[Secession (art)|Secession]] style.

[[File:Rzeszow - rynek glowny. 1908 (89975817).jpg|thumb|left|Market Square in 1908]]
During [[World War I]], several battles took place near the town. Rzeszów was home to a large garrison of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], and in the city of [[Przemyśl]], located nearby, there was a major fortress. During the [[Battle of Galicia]] in the late summer of 1914, Russian troops moved towards Rzeszów, and on 21 September, they captured it. The first Russian occupation lasted only 16 days, ending after an attack by the Austrians, on 4 October.

Under Russian pressure, the Austrians were unable to keep the town, and on 7 November, the Russians again appeared in Rzeszów. In the late fall of 1914, the front line was established between Tarnów and [[Gorlice]], and Rzeszów became an important center of the [[Imperial Russian Army]], with large magazines of food and ammunition located there. The Russian occupation lasted until May 1915. After the Russians were pushed out of Galicia, Rzeszów remained outside the area of military activity. The Austrian administration returned, but wartime reality and damage to the town had a negative effect on the population, and the quality of life deteriorated.

===Interwar period===
[[File:Rzeszow, Plac Farny 1938 (68115890).jpg|thumb|''Plac Farny'' in 1938]]
On 12 October 1918, Rzeszów's mayor, together with the town council, sent a message to [[Warsaw]], announcing loyalty to the independent [[Second Polish Republic]]. On November 1, after clashes with German and Austrian troops, Rzeszów was liberated, and the next day, mayor Roman Krogulski took a pledge of allegiance to the reborn Polish state. During World War I some 200 residents of Rzeszów died, rail infrastructure was destroyed, as well as approximately 60 houses.

In 1920, Rzeszów became capital of a county in the [[Lwów Voivodeship]]. The town grew, and the creation of the [[Central Industrial Region (Poland)|Central Industrial Region]] had an enormous impact on Rzeszów. It became a major center of the defense industry, with [[Państwowe Zakłady Lotnicze|PZL]] Rzeszów opening there in 1937. It was also home to a large garrison of the Polish Army, with the [[10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade (Poland)|10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade]] stationed there. In 1939, Rzeszów had 40,000 inhabitants, but its dynamic growth was stopped by the [[Invasion of Poland]] and outbreak of [[World War II]].

===Second World War===
[[File:Flugmotorenwerke Reichshof GmbH (1941).jpg|thumb|left|Aircraft engine factory during German occupation]]
On 6–8 September 1939, Rzeszów was bombed by the [[Luftwaffe]]. The town was defended by the [[10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade (Poland)|10th Cavalry Brigade]] and [[Uhlans|24th Uhlan Regiment]] from [[Kraśnik]]. The German attack began on 8 September in the afternoon, and the [[Wehrmacht]] entered Rzeszów the next morning. The ''[[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe I]]'' entered the city to commit [[Nazi crimes against the Polish nation|crimes against the population]], and its members co-formed the local German police.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wardzyńska|first=Maria|year=2009|title=Był rok 1939.

The occupiers established a Nazi prison, in which they imprisoned over 1,100 Poles, especially the [[intelligentsia]], arrested in the region between October 1939 and June 1940, during the ''[[Intelligenzaktion]]''.<ref name=mw>Wardzyńska, p. 257</ref> Some people were eventually released, some were deported to prisons in [[Kraków]] and [[Tarnów]], while many were executed at the prison yard.<ref name=mw/> On 2 November 1939, the Germans carried out mass arrests of local priests and Bernardine friars, and afterwards, they also carried out executions of Polish intelligentsia at the local Bernardine monastery.<ref>Wardzyńska, pp. 257–258</ref>

Persecution of Polish intelligentsia was continued with the ''[[German AB-Aktion in Poland|AB-Aktion]]'', and on 27 June 1940, 104 Poles from the local prison were exterminated in the forest of [[Lubzina]].<ref>Wardzyńska, p. 269</ref> In 1941, the Germans established a [[Nazi ghettos|ghetto]], whose Jewish inhabitants were later murdered in [[Bełżec extermination camp]] (for more information see ''The Holocaust'' below).

[[File:Monument to Home Army in Rzeszów (2022)b.jpg|thumb|[[Home Army]] Monument]]
During the war, Rzeszów was a main center of the [[Polish Underground State]], with the Rzeszów Inspectorate of the [[Home Army]] covering several counties. On 25 May, during Action Kosba, Home Army soldiers killed the [[Gestapo]] henchmen Friederich Pottenbaum and Hans Flaschke on a Rzeszów street. In the summer of 1944, during [[Operation Tempest]], units of the Home Army attacked German positions in the town, and on 2 August, Rzeszów was in the hands of the Home Army.

Polish authorities loyal to the [[Polish government-in-exile]] tried to negotiate with the Soviets, but without success. The [[NKVD]] immediately opened a prison in the cellars of the Rzeszów Castle, sending there a number of Home Army soldiers. On the night of 7/9 October 1944, a Home Army unit under [[Łukasz Ciepliński]] attacked the castle, trying to release 400 inmates kept there. The attack failed, and [[1951 Mokotów Prison execution|Ciepliński was captured and subsequently executed in 1951]].

Before the outbreak of World War II, the Jews of Rzeszów numbered 14,000, more than one-third of the total population.<ref name="Virtual">{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0017_0_17208.html|title=Rzeszow|work=jewishvirtuallibrary.org|access-date=5 February 2010}}</ref> The town was occupied by the German Army on 10 September 1939 and was renamed "Reichshof".<ref name="Virtual" /> German [[Persecution of Jews|persecution of the Jews]] began almost immediately. By the end of 1939, there were 10 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]] camps in the Rzeszów region and many Jews became [[Slavery|slave labour]]ers.

Many Jews managed to flee to [[Kresy|Soviet-occupied eastern Poland]]. By June 1940, the number of Jews in Rzeszów had decreased to 11,800, of whom 7,800 were pre-war residents of the city; the rest were from the surrounding villages. As in all [[List of Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland|Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland]], life in the ghetto was impossible and hundreds died of malnutrition and disease. During the war, some 20,000 Jews were murdered in the ghetto in Rzeszów. This number includes thousands who were sent to Rzeszów only to be deported or murdered soon after arrival.<ref name="JVL"/><ref name="auto2">{{cite web|url=http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/ghettos/rzeszow.html|title=Rzeszow www.HolocaustResearchProject.org|access-date=28 April 2017}}</ref>

In the summer of 1942, hundreds were murdered in forests near Rzeszów. Hundreds more were sent to [[Belzec extermination camp|Belzec]] to be immediately gassed. Later in 1942, another round up sent nearly 1,500 children to their deaths and their parents to labor camps. In final "[[Aktion]]s" in the fall of 1943, most Jewish slave labour was transported in [[Holocaust trains]] to the newly reopened [[Szebnie concentration camp]].

On 7 July 1945, Rzeszów became capital of the newly created [[Rzeszów Voivodeship]], which consisted of western counties of prewar Lwów Voivodeship, and several counties of prewar [[Kraków Voivodeship (1919–1939)|Kraków Voivodeship]]. This decision had a major impact on the city, as it quickly grew. New offices of the regional government were built, and in 1951, several neighbouring villages were included within the city limits of Rzeszów, and the area of the city grew to 39&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.

Before the [[Polish People's Republic]] deported [[Ukrainians in Poland|ethnic Ukrainians]] to the western "[[Recovered Territories]]" in [[Operation Vistula]], the city was a major base of support for the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] during the [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland (1944–1953)|Polish anti-communist resistance.]]<ref>Applebaum, Anne (2012).
