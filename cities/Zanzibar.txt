It is an [[Zanzibar Archipelago|archipelago]] in the [[Indian Ocean]], {{cvt|25|-|50|km|mi}} off the coast of the African [[mainland]], and consists of many small islands and two large ones: [[Unguja]] (the main island, referred to informally as Zanzibar) and [[Pemba Island]]. The capital is [[Zanzibar City]], located on the island of Unguja. Its historic centre, [[Stone Town]], is a [[World Heritage Site]].

The word ''Zanzibar'' came from [[Arabic]] ''zanjibār'' ({{lang|ar|زنجبار}} {{IPA|[zandʒibaːr]}}), which is in turn from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''zangbâr'' ({{lang|fa|زنگبار}} {{IPA|[zæŋbɒːɾ]}}), a compound of ''[[Zanj|Zang]]'' ({{lang|fa|زنگ}} {{IPA|[zæŋ]}}, "black") + ''bâr'' ({{lang|fa|بار}} {{IPA|[bɒːɾ]}}, "coast"),<ref>{{OEtymD|zanzibar}}</ref><ref name="Burton2010">{{cite book |author=Richard F.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Zanzibar}}

=== Before 1498 ===
The presence of [[microlith]]s suggests that Zanzibar has been home to humans for at least 20,000 years,<ref>{{cite book |last= Hashim |first=Nadra O. |title=Language and Collective Mobilization: The Story of Zanzibar |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LVFYmNO7BeEC&pg=PAxi |year=2009 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=978-0-73913708-6 |page=xi |access-date=14 November 2015 |archive-date=12 January 2023 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20230112064543/https://books.google.com/books?id=LVFYmNO7BeEC&pg=PAxi |url-status=live }}</ref> which was the beginning of the [[Later Stone Age]].

A Greco-Roman text between the 1st and 3rd centuries, the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'', mentioned the island of ''Menuthias'' ({{langx|grc|Μενουθιάς}}), which is probably [[Unguja]].<ref name="Pearce">{{Cite book |first=Francis Barrow |last=Pearce |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XRRzAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA81-IA2 |title= Zanzibar: The Island Metropolis of Eastern Africa |date=1920 |publisher= Dutton & Com |location=New York City |author-link=Francis Barrow Pearce |access-date=14 November 2015 |archive-date=12 January 2023 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20230112064543/https://books.google.com/books?id=XRRzAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA81-IA2 |url-status=live }}</ref> 

At the outset of the first millennium, both Zanzibar and the nearby coast were settled by [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] speakers. Archaeological finds at Fukuchani, on the northwest coast of Zanzibar, indicate a settled agricultural and fishing community from the 6th century at the latest. The considerable amount of [[Wattle and daub|daub]] found indicates timber buildings, and shell beads, bead grinders, and iron slag have been found at the site. There is evidence of limited engagement in long-distance trade: a small amount of imported pottery has been found, less than 1% of total pottery finds, mostly from the Gulf and dated to the 5th to 8th century. The similarity to contemporary sites such as Mkokotoni and Dar es Salaam indicates a unified group of communities that developed into the first center of coastal maritime culture. The coastal towns appear to have been engaged in Indian Ocean and inland African trade at this early period.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kusimba |first1=Chapurukha |last2=Walz |first2=Jonathan |year=2018 |title=When did the Swahili become Maritime?: A Reply to Fleisher et al.

Excavations at nearby Pemba Island, but especially at Shanga in the Lamu Archipelago, provide the clearest picture of architectural development. Houses were originally built with timber (circa 1050) and later in mud with coral walls (circa 1150). The houses were continually rebuilt with more permanent materials. By the 13th century, houses were built with stone, and bonded with mud, and the 14th century saw the use of lime to bond stone. Only the wealthier patricians would have had stone- and lime-built houses, and the strength of the materials allowed for flat roofs. By contrast, the majority of the population lived in single-story thatched houses similar to those of the 11th and 12th centuries. According to John Middleton and Mark Horton, the architectural style of these stone houses have no Arab or Persian elements, and should be viewed as an entirely indigenous development of local vernacular architecture. While much of Zanzibar Town's architecture was rebuilt during Omani rule, nearby sites elucidate the general development of Swahili and Zanzibari architecture before the 15th century.<ref name= SLandscape />{{rp|119}}

From the 9th century, Swahili merchants on Zanzibar operated as brokers for long-distance traders from both the hinterland and Indian Ocean world. Persian, Indian, and Arab traders frequented Zanzibar to acquire East African goods like gold, ivory, and ambergris and then shipped them overseas to Asia. Similarly, caravan traders from the [[African Great Lakes]] and [[Zambezian Region]] came to the coast to trade for imported goods, especially Indian cloth. Before the Portuguese arrival, the southern towns of [[Unguja Ukuu]] and [[Kizimkazi]] and the northern town of [[Tumbatu]] were the dominant centres of exchange. Zanzibar was just one of the many autonomous city-states that dotted the East African coast. These towns grew in wealth as the [[Swahili people]] served as intermediaries and facilitators to merchants and traders.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kusimba |first=Chapurukha |title=The Rise and Decline of Swahili States |place=Walnut Creek, California |publisher=Altamira |year=1999 |isbn=9780761990512}}</ref> This interaction between Central African and Indian Ocean cultures contributed in part to the evolution of the [[Swahili culture]], which developed an Arabic-script literary tradition. Although a Bantu language, the [[Swahili language]] as a consequence today includes some borrowed elements, particularly [[loanword]]s from [[Arabic]], though this was mostly a 19th-century phenomenon with the growth of Omani hegemony. Many foreign traders from Africa and Asia married into wealthy patrician families on Zanzibar. Asian men in particular, who resided on the coast for up to six months because of the prevailing monsoon wind patterns, married East African women. Since almost all the Asian traders were Muslims, their children inherited their paternal ethnic identity, though East African matrilineal traditions remained key.<ref>{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Gwynn |title= Africa and the Indian Ocean World from Early Times to Circa 1900 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2019 |isbn= 978-1-10857862-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=Stephanie |last1= Wynne-Jones |first2=Adria |last2=LaViolette |title=The Swahili World |publisher=Routledge |year=2018 |isbn=978-1-13891346-2}}</ref>

=== Portuguese colonization ===

[[Vasco da Gama]]'s visit in 1498 marked the beginning of European influence. In 1503 or 1504, Zanzibar became part of the [[Portuguese Empire]] when Captain Rui Lourenço Ravasco Marques came ashore and received tribute from the sultan in exchange for peace.<ref name="Ingrams">{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=oYhrCkGaxyUC |title=Zanzibar: Its History and Its People |first=W.

It initially became part of the Portuguese province of Arabia and Ethiopia and was administered by a governor-general. Around 1571, Zanzibar became part of the western division of the Portuguese empire and was administered from [[Mozambique]].<ref name="Eliot"/>{{rp| 15}} It appears, however, that the Portuguese did not closely administer Zanzibar. The first English ship to visit Unguja, the ''Edward Bonaventure'' in 1591, found that there was no Portuguese fort or garrison. The extent of their occupation was a trade depot where produce was bought and collected for shipment to Mozambique. "In other respects, the affairs of the island were managed by the local 'king', the predecessor of the Mwinyi Mkuu of Dunga."<ref name="Pearce"/>{{rp| 81}} This hands-off approach ended when Portugal established a fort on Pemba Island around 1635 in response to the Sultan of [[Mombasa]]'s slaughter of Portuguese residents several years earlier. Portugal had long considered Pemba to be a troublesome launching point for rebellions in Mombasa against Portuguese rule.<ref name="Pearce"/>{{rp| 85}}

The precise origins of the sultans of Unguja are uncertain. However, their capital at [[Unguja Ukuu]] is believed to have been an extensive town. Possibly constructed by locals, it was composed mainly of perishable materials.<ref name="Pearce"/>{{rp| 89}}

The Portuguese arrived in East Africa in 1498, where they found several independent towns on the coast, with Muslim Arabic-speaking elites. While the Portuguese travellers describe them as "black", they made a clear distinction between the Muslim and non-Muslim populations.<ref>Prestholdt, Jeremy. "Portuguese Conceptual Categories and the ‘Other’ Encounter on the Swahili Coast." Journal of Asian American Studies, Volume 36, Issue 4, 390.</ref> Their relations with these leaders were mostly hostile, but during the sixteenth century, they firmly established their power and ruled with the aid of tributary sultans. The Portuguese presence was relatively limited, leaving administration in the hands of the local leaders and power structures already present. This system lasted until 1631, when the Sultan of Mombasa massacred the Portuguese inhabitants. For the remainder of their rule, the Portuguese appointed European governors.

Until around 1890, the sultans of Zanzibar controlled a substantial portion of the Swahili coast known as [[Zanj]], which included Mombasa and [[Dar es Salaam]]. Beginning in 1886, Great Britain and Germany agreed to allocate parts of the Zanzibar sultanate for their own empires.<ref name="Appiah"/>{{rp|188}} In October 1886, a British-German border commission established the Zanj as a {{cvt|10|nmi|km|adj=mid|-wide}} strip along most of the [[African Great Lakes]] region's coast, an area stretching from [[Cape Delgado]] (now in [[Mozambique]]) to [[Kipini]] (now in [[Kenya]]), including Mombasa and Dar es Salaam. Over the next few years most all of the mainland territory was incorporated into [[German East Africa]].
The sultans developed an economy of trade and [[cash crop]]s in the Zanzibar Archipelago with a ruling Arab elite. [[Ivory]] was a major trade good. The archipelago, sometimes referred to by locals as the Spice Islands, was famous worldwide for its cloves and other spices, and plantations were established to grow them. The archipelago's commerce gradually fell into the hands of traders from the [[Indian subcontinent]], whom Said bin Sultan encouraged to settle on the islands.

During his 14-year reign as sultan, Majid bin Said consolidated his power around the [[East African slave trade]]. Malindi in Zanzibar City was the Swahili Coast's main port for the slave trade with the Middle East. In the mid-19th century, as many as 50,000 slaves passed annually through the port.<ref name="nationalgeographic"/><ref>{{Cite book |last=Borders |first=Everett |title=Apart Type Screenplay |publisher=Xlibris Corporation |year=2010 |location= United States of America |page =117}}</ref>

=== British protectorate ===
[[File:Zanzibar stamp.png|thumb|The post office in Zanzibar was initially managed by the postal service of British India.]]
Control of Zanzibar eventually came into the hands of the [[British Empire]]; part of the political impetus for this was the 19th century movement for the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of the slave trade]]. Zanzibar was the centre of the [[East African slave trade]]. In 1822, Captain Moresby, the British [[consul (representative)|consul]] in Muscat pressed Sultan Said to end the slave trade by signing a treaty.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sherif |first=Abdul |title=Slaves, Spices and Ivory in Zanzibar: Integration of an East African Coast into the World Economy, 1770–1873 |publisher=Ohio University Press |year=1987 |chapter =Athens}}</ref>

This [[Moresby Treaty]] was the first of a series of anti-slavery treaties with Britain. It prohibited slave transport south and east of the Moresby Line, from Cape Delgado in Africa to Diu Head on the coast of India.<ref name="McIntyre">Chris McIntyre, Susan McIntyre (2013). ''Zanzibar'', Bradt Travel Guides, p. 10.</ref> Said lost the revenue he would have received as duty on all slaves sold, so to make up for this shortfall he encouraged the development of the slave trade in Zanzibar itself.<ref name="McIntyre"/> Said came under increasing pressure from the British to abolish slavery entirely. In 1842, Britain told Said it wished to abolish the slave trade to Arabia, Oman, Persia, and the Red Sea.<ref>McIntyre & McIntyre, p. 13.</ref>

[[File:Zanzibar 1900 to 1920.jpg|thumb|left|A street scene in Zanzibar during the early 20th century]]
Ships from the [[Royal Navy]] were employed to enforce the anti-slavery treaties by capturing any [[dhow]]s carrying slaves, but with only four ships patrolling a huge area of sea, the British navy found it hard to enforce the treaties as ships from France, Spain, Portugal, and America continued to carry slaves.<ref>McIntyre & McIntyre, p. 14.</ref> In 1856, Sultan [[Majid bin Said of Zanzibar|Majid]] consolidated his power around the [[African Great Lakes]] slave trade. But in 1873, Sir [[John Kirk (explorer)|John Kirk]] informed his successor, Sultan [[Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar|Barghash]], that a total blockade of Zanzibar was imminent, and Barghash reluctantly signed the Anglo-Zanzibari treaty which abolished the slave trade in the sultan's territories, closed all slave markets and protected liberated slaves.<ref>McIntyre & McIntyre, p. 19.</ref>

The relationship between Britain and the [[German Empire]], at that time the nearest relevant colonial power, was formalized by the 1890 [[Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty]], in which Germany agreed to "recognize the British protectorate over… the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba".<ref>[http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/pdf/eng/606_Anglo-German%20Treaty_110.pdf Article XI, Anglo-German Treaty (Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty)] {{Webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181123133909/http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/pdf/eng/606_Anglo-German%20Treaty_110.pdf |date=23 November 2018 }}, 1 July 1890 ([[PDF]]).</ref>

In 1890, Zanzibar became a [[protectorate]] (not a colony) of Britain. This status meant it remained under the sovereignty of the [[Sultan of Zanzibar]]. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Prime Minister Salisbury]] explained the British position:
:The condition of a protected dependency is more acceptable to the half civilised races, and more suitable for them than direct dominion. It is cheaper, simpler, less wounding to their self-esteem, gives them more career as public officials, and spares them unnecessary contact with white men.<ref>Andrew Roberts, ''Salisbury: Victorian Titan'' (1999) p 529</ref>

From 1890 to 1913, traditional [[vizier]]s were in charge; they were supervised by advisers appointed by the Colonial Office. In 1913, this was changed to direct rule through residents who were effectively governors. The death of the pro-British Sultan [[Hamad bin Thuwaini]] on 25 August 1896 and the succession of Sultan [[Khalid bin Barghash of Zanzibar|Khalid bin Barghash]], whom the British did not approve of, led to the [[Anglo-Zanzibar War]]. On the morning of 27 August 1896, ships of the [[Royal Navy]] destroyed the Beit al Hukum Palace. A cease-fire was declared 38&nbsp;minutes later, and to this day the bombardment stands as the shortest war in history.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldre000guin |title=Guinness World Records 2008 |date=7 August 2007 |publisher=Guinness World Records |isbn=978-1-904994-19-0|editor-last=Craig Glenday |location= London |page= [https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldre000guin/page/118 118] |url-access=registration}}</ref>

=== Languages ===
==== Swahili ====
Zanzibaris speak [[Swahili language|Swahili]] (Kiswahili), a [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]] that is extensively spoken in the [[African Great Lakes]] region. Swahili is the de facto [[National language|national]] and [[official language]] of Tanzania. Many local residents also speak [[Arabic]], [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]].<ref>Chris McIntyre and Susan McIntyre, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zlqv0gSkk-kC&dq=purest+form+of+swahili+zanzibar&pg=PA36 "Zanzibar, Pemba, and Mafia"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230112064543/https://books.google.com/books?id=Zlqv0gSkk-kC&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36&dq=purest+form+of+swahili+zanzibar&source=bl&ots=mO3h6Xd7Ao&sig=yPmOLFlSPZC44LfT6c_vyOKooKw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=fRvPUOHFM67piwLy6YD4Bg&ved=0CGgQ6AEwCg#v=onepage&q=purest%20form%20of%20swahili%20zanzibar&f=false |date=12 January 2023 }}, ''Bradt Travel Guide'', 2009, p. 36.</ref> 
The dialect of Swahili spoken in Zanzibar is called [[Kiunguja]]. Kiunguja, which has a high percentage of Arabic loanwords, enjoys the status of Standard Swahili not in Tanzania only but also in other countries, where Swahili is spoken.<ref name="Sarali Gintsburg 2018">Sarali Gintsburg (2018) Arabic language in Zanzibar: past, present, and future, Journal of World Languages, 5:2, 81–100, {{doi|10.1080/21698252.2019.1570663}}.</ref>

==== Arabic ====
Three distinct varieties of Arabic are in use in Zanzibar: Standard Arabic, [[Omani Arabic]] and [[Hadrami Arabic]]. Both vernacular varieties are falling out of use, although the Omani one is spoken by a larger group of people (probably, several hundreds). In parallel to this, [[Standard Arabic]], traditionally associated with the [[Quran]] and [[Islam]], is very popular not only among ethnic Arabs but also among Muslims of various descent who inhabit Zanzibar. Nevertheless, Standard Arabic is mastered by very few people. This can be attributed to the aggressive policy of [[Swahilization|Swahilisation]]. Despite the prestige and importance the Arabic language once enjoyed, today it is no longer the dominant spoken language.<ref name="Sarali Gintsburg 2018"/>

== Government ==
{{Politics of Tanzania}}
As an autonomous part of [[Tanzania]], Zanzibar has its own government, known as the [[Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar]]. It is made up of the [[Revolutionary Council (Zanzibar)|Revolutionary Council]] and [[House of Representatives of Zanzibar|House of Representatives]].
The House of Representatives has a similar composition to the [[National Assembly of Tanzania]]. Fifty members are elected directly from constituencies to serve five-year terms; 10 members are appointed by the [[President of Zanzibar]]; 15 special seats are for women members of political parties that have representation in the House of Representatives; six members serve ''[[ex officio member|ex officio]]'', including all regional commissioners and the attorney general.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zanzibarassembly.go.tz/composition.html |title=Composition |publisher=The House of Representatives – Zanzibar |access-date=23 October 2012}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Five of these 81 members are then elected to represent Zanzibar in the National Assembly.<ref>[http://www.parliament.go.tz/index.php/home/pages/6 Composition, Parliament of Tanzania] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021211837/http://www.parliament.go.tz/index.php/home/pages/6 |date=21 October 2015 }}</ref>

Zanzibar spans 5 of the 31 [[regions of Tanzania]]. Unguja has three administrative regions: [[Zanzibar Central/South]], [[Zanzibar North]] and [[Zanzibar Urban/West]]. Pemba has two: [[Pemba North]] and [[Pemba South]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statoids.com/utz.html |title=Tanzania Regions |website=www.statoids.com |access-date=12 March 2018 |archive-date=25 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181225065231/http://www.statoids.com/utz.html%20 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Concerning the independence and sovereignty of Zanzibar, Tanzania Prime Minister [[Mizengo Pinda]] said on 3 July 2008 that there was "nothing like the sovereignty of Zanzibar in the Union Government unless the Constitution is changed in future". Zanzibar House of Representatives members from both the ruling party, [[Chama Cha Mapinduzi]], and the opposition party, [[Civic United Front]], disagreed and stood firmly in recognizing Zanzibar as a fully autonomous state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unpo.org/article/8392 |title=Zanzibar: Premier under fire on Zanzibar status |date=10 July 2008 |publisher=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization |access-date=23 October 2012 |archive-date=3 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303021026/http://www.unpo.org/article/8392 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Zanzibar has a government of national unity, with the president of Zanzibar being [[Hussein Ali Mwinyi]], since 1 November 2020. There are many political parties in Zanzibar, but the most popular parties are the [[Chama Cha Mapinduzi]] (CCM) and the [[Civic United Front]] (CUF). Since the early 1990s, the politics of the archipelago have been marked by repeated clashes between these two parties.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Throup |first=David W. |date=18 March 2016 |title=The Political Crisis in Zanzibar |url=https://www.csis.org/analysis/political-crisis-zanzibar |access-date=23 March 2024 |website=[[Center for strategic and international studies]]}}</ref>

Contested elections in October 2000 led to a massacre on 27 January 2001 when, according to [[Human Rights Watch]], the army and police shot into crowds of protestors, killing at least 35 and wounding more than 600. Those forces, accompanied by ruling party officials and militias, also went on a house-to-house rampage, indiscriminately arresting, beating, and sexually abusing residents. Approximately 2,000 temporarily fled to Kenya.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2002/04/10/tanzan3838.htm |title=Tanzania: Zanzibar Election Massacres Documented |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=10 April 2002 |access-date=27 August 2010 |archive-date=20 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020214543/http://hrw.org/english/docs/2002/04/10/tanzan3838.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Following 2005, negotiations between the two parties aiming at the long-term resolution of the tensions and a power-sharing accord took place, but they suffered repeated setbacks. The most notable of these took place in April 2008, when the CUF walked away from the negotiating table following a CCM call for a referendum to approve of what had been presented as a done deal on the power-sharing agreement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tzaffairs.org/2008/05/zanzibar-a-big-disappointment |title=Tanzanian Affairs » ZANZIBAR – A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT |website=www.tzaffairs.org |date=May 2008 |access-date=12 March 2018 |archive-date=6 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006012831/https://www.tzaffairs.org/2008/05/zanzibar-a-big-disappointment/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The autonomous status of Zanzibar is viewed as comparable to [[Hong Kong]] as suggested by some scholars, and with some recognizing the island as an "African Hong Kong".<ref>Simon Shen, ''One country, two systems: Zanzibar'', Ming Pao Weekly, Sep 2016.</ref>

Nowadays, [[Alliance for Change and Transparency|The Alliance for Change and Transparency-Wazalendois]] (ACT-Wazalendo) is considered the main opposition political party of semi-autonomous Zanzibar. The constitution of Zanzibar requires the party that comes in second in the polls to join a coalition with the winning party.

=== Climate ===
{{see also|Climate of Tanzania}}
Zanzibar has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Am]]). The heat of summer (corresponding to the Northern Hemisphere winter) is often cooled by strong sea breezes associated with the [[northeast monsoon]] (known as ''Kaskazi'' in Kiswahili), particularly on the north and east coasts. Being near to the equator, the islands are warm year round. The rainfall regime is split into two main seasons, a primary maximum in March, April, and May in association with the [[southwest monsoon]] (known locally as ''Kusi'' in Kiswahili), and a secondary maximum in November and December.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zanzinet.org/zanzibar/nature/hali_ya_hewa.html |title=Climate and Soils |work=Zanzinet Forum |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006230003/http://www.zanzinet.org/zanzibar/nature/hali_ya_hewa.html |archive-date=2014-10-06}}</ref> The months in between receive less rain, with a minimum in July.

Endemic mammals with continental relatives include the [[Zanzibar red colobus]] (''Procolobus kirkii''), one of Africa's rarest primates, with perhaps only 1,500 existing. Isolated on this island for at least 1,000 years, this colobus is recognized as a distinct species, with different coat patterns, calls, and food habits from related colobus species on the mainland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.galenfrysinger.com/red_colobus.htm |title=Red Colobus |publisher=galenfrysinger.com |access-date=27 August 2010 |archive-date=25 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825112259/http://www.galenfrysinger.com/red_colobus.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> The Zanzibar red colobus lives in a wide variety of drier areas of coastal thickets and coral rag scrub, as well as [[mangrove swamp]]s and agricultural areas. About one third of them live in and around [[Jozani Chwaka Bay National Park|Jozani Forest]]. The easiest place to see the colobus is farmland adjacent to the reserve. They are accustomed to people and the low vegetation means they come close to the ground.

Rare native animals include the [[Zanzibar leopard]],<ref name="InsideEdition 06-2018"/><ref name="MysteriousUniverse 06-2018"/> which is critically endangered, and the recently described [[Zanzibar servaline genet]]. There are no large wild animals in Unguja.

Various species of mongoose can also be found on the island. There is a wide variety of birdlife and a large number of butterflies in rural areas.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

[[Pemba Island]] is separated from Unguja island and the African continent by deep channels and has a correspondingly restricted fauna, reflecting its comparative isolation from the mainland.<ref name=Pakenham1984/><ref name=Walsh2007/> The island is home to the [[Pemba flying fox]].

== Standard of living and health ==
Considerable disparities exist in the [[standard of living]] for inhabitants of Pemba and Unguja, as well as the disparity between urban and rural populations. The average annual income is US $2500. About half the population lives below the poverty line.

Despite a relatively high standard of primary health care and education, [[infant mortality]] in Zanzibar is 54 out of 1,000 live births, which is 10.0 percent lower than the rate in mainland Tanzania.

Ancient [[pottery]] implies trade routes with Zanzibar as far back as the time of the ancient [[Assyria]]ns. Traders from the [[Arabian Peninsula]], the [[Persian Gulf]] region of modern-day [[Iran]] (especially [[Shiraz]]), and [[west India]] probably visited Zanzibar as early as the 1st century.

The Government of Zanzibar legalized foreign exchange bureaux on the islands before mainland Tanzania moved to do so. The effect was to increase the availability of consumer commodities. The government has also established a free port area, which provides the following benefits: contribution to economic diversification by providing a window for free trade as well as stimulating the establishment of support services; administration of a regime that imports, exports, and warehouses general merchandise; adequate storage facilities and other infrastructure to cater for effective operation of trade; and creation of an efficient management system for effective re-exportation of goods.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2843.htm |title=Background Note: Tanzania |author=Bureau of African Affairs |date=8 June 2010 |publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]] |access-date=27 August 2010 |archive-date=22 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170122194610/https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2843.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

The island's manufacturing sector is limited mainly to import substitution industries, such as cigarettes, shoes, and processed agricultural products.

The energy sector in Zanzibar consists of unreliable electric power, petroleum and petroleum products; it is also supplemented by firewood and its related products. Coal and gas are rarely used for either domestic or industrial purposes.

Unguja (Zanzibar Island) gets most of its electric power from mainland Tanzania through a 39-kilometer, 100-megawatt submarine cable from Ras Kiromoni (near Dar es Salaam) to Ras Fumba on Unguja. The laying of the cable was begun on 10 October 2012 by the Viscas Corporation of Japan and was funded by a US$28.1 million grant from the United States through the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]].<ref>[http://tanzania.usembassy.gov/pr_10102012c.html "Ambassador Lenhardt Participates in Ceremony to Install 100 Megawatt Submarine Power to Zanzibar"] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217123714/http://tanzania.usembassy.gov/pr_10102012c.html |date=17 February 2013 }}.

Between 70 and 75 percent of the electricity generated is used domestically while less than 20 percent is used industrially. Fuel wood, charcoal and kerosene are widely used as sources of energy for cooking and lighting for most rural and urban areas.

=== Public transportation ===

There is no government-owned public transportation in Zanzibar. The privately owned [[Dala-dala|Daladala]], as it is officially known in Zanzibar, is the only kind of public transportation. The term Daladala originated from the Kiswahili word DALA (Dollar) or five shillings during the 1970s and 1980s when public transport cost five shillings to travel to the nearest town. Therefore, travelling to town will cost a Dollar ("Dala") and returning will again cost a Dollar, hence the term Daladala originated.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mzfn.org/Zanzibar.html |title=MZF {{!}} About Zanzibar|website=www.mzfn.org |access-date=2019-08-04 |archive-date=4 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190804063514/https://www.mzfn.org/Zanzibar.html |url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[Stone Town]] is the main hub for [[Dala dala|Daladalas]] on Zanzibar and nearly all journeys will either start or end here. There are two main Dala Dala stations in Stone Town: Darajani market and Mwanakwerekwe market. The Darajani market terminus serves the North and North East of the island and the Mwanakwerekwe market terminus serves the South and South East. As with most of East African transport, the buses do not run on set schedules – instead departing when full. As there is no fixed schedule, it is not possible to book tickets in advance (with the exception of [http://www.thezanzibus.com The Zanzibus]). There are plans to implement a government-operated bus service on the island, which will bring the ground transportations more in line with the relatively developed water and air transport infrastructure. With Zanzibar visitor numbers set to exceed 1,000,000 annually, there will be increasing pressure on the current transportation network – the bus network will reduce the number of vehicles on the road and help reduce environmental impact of tourism on Zanzibar.

Since another increase in capacity by the end of 2013, it can serve up to 1.5 million passengers per year.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |url=http://www.businesstimes.co.tz/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1121:zanzibar-forms-airports-authority-modernises-aviation-infrastructure&catid=1:latest-news&Itemid=57 |title=Zanzibar forms Airports Authority, modernises aviation infrastructure |publisher=Business Times (Tanzania) |access-date=17 January 2013 |archive-date=1 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101215243/http://www.businesstimes.co.tz/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1121:zanzibar-forms-airports-authority-modernises-aviation-infrastructure&catid=1:latest-news&Itemid=57 |url-status=live }}</ref> The island can be reached by flights operated by [[Air France]], [[Auric Air]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.auricair.com/Destination/zanzibar-Island |title=Daily Flights to Zanzibar |access-date=5 June 2021 |publisher=AuricAir Services Ltd |archive-date=5 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210605182504/https://www.auricair.com/Destination/zanzibar-Island |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Air Tanzania]], [[Coastal Aviation]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://coastal.co.tz/where-we-fly/zanzibar/ |title=Zanzibar |publisher=Coastal Aviation Limited |access-date=5 June 2021 |archive-date=14 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210614082453/https://coastal.co.tz/where-we-fly/zanzibar/ |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Ethiopian Airlines]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ethiopianairlines.com/aa/book/network/international |title=International [Flight Network] |publisher=Ethiopian Airlines |access-date=5 June 2021 |archive-date=15 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210415134232/https://www.ethiopianairlines.com/aa/book/network/international |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Kenya Airways]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.kenya-airways.com/plan-and-book/destinations/africa/en/ |title=Book Cheap Flights to Africa |publisher=Kenya Airways |access-date=5 June 2021 |archive-date=5 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210605182503/https://www.kenya-airways.com/plan-and-book/destinations/africa/en/ |url-status=live }}</ref> [[FlyDubai]], [[Qatar Airways]], [[Turkish Airlines]] and others.

[[File:Zanzibar International Film Festival 2013.jpg|thumb|ZIFF, 2013]]
Zanzibar's most famous event is the [[Zanzibar International Film Festival]] (ZIFF), also known as the Festival of the Dhow Countries. Every July, this event showcases the best of the Swahili Coast arts scene, including Zanzibar's favorite music, [[taarab]].{{cn|date=February 2024}} Zanzibar is the birthplace of the British singer-songwriter and band leader of [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Freddie Mercury]].

Important architectural features in Stone Town are the Livingstone house, [[The Old dispensary of Zanzibar]], the Guliani Bridge, Ngome kongwe (The [[Old fort of Zanzibar]]) and the [[House of Wonders]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zanzibarheritage.go.tz/House%20of%20Wonders%20Museum.htm |title=The House of Wonders Museum of History & Culture of Zanzibar & the Swahili Coast |publisher=Department of Archives, Museums and Antiquities |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116053540/http://www.zanzibarheritage.go.tz/House%20of%20Wonders%20Museum.htm |archive-date=16 November 2012}}</ref> The town of [[Kidichi]] features the [[Hamamni Persian Baths]], built by immigrants from [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]], Iran during the reign of [[Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar|Barghash bin Said]].

Zanzibar also is the only place in Eastern African countries to have the long settlement houses formally known as [[Michenzani]] flats. The flats were built with aid from [[East Germany]] during the 1970s to solve housing problems in Zanzibar.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bakari |first=Mohammed Ali |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9yCSamtUeiAC&dq=Michenzani+East+Germany+during+the+1970s+housing+problems+in+Zanzibar&pg=PA128 |title=The Democratisation Process in Zanzibar: A Retarded Transition |date=2001 |publisher=GIGA-Hamburg |isbn=978-3-928049-71-9 |language=en |access-date=28 November 2022 |archive-date=12 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230112064544/https://books.google.com/books?id=9yCSamtUeiAC&dq=Michenzani+East+Germany+during+the+1970s+housing+problems+in+Zanzibar&pg=PA128 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Media and communication ===
In 1973, Zanzibar introduced the first colour television service in sub-Saharan Africa.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=7h1DAQAAIAAJ&q=Zanzibar+ ''Mass Media, Towards the Millennium: The South African Handbook of Mass Communication''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230112064544/https://books.google.com/books?id=7h1DAQAAIAAJ&dq=Zanzibar+colour+tv+in+Africa+1973.&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Zanzibar+ |date=12 January 2023 }}, Arrie De Beer, J.L. van Schaik, 1998, page 56</ref> Because of longstanding opposition to television by President [[Julius Nyerere]], the first television service on mainland Tanzania was not introduced until 1994.<ref>Martin Stumer, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110626211052/http://www.tanzania.at/mht/The_Media_History_of_Tanzania.pdf "The Media History of Tanzania"], Salzburg, Austria: Ndanda Mission Press, 1998, pp. 191, 194, 295.</ref> The broadcaster in Zanzibar called Television Zanzibar ([[TVZ]]) had recently changed name to Zanzibar Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC).<ref>[http://www.tvz.co.tz/tvz.html Karume House: Television Zanzibar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703181848/http://www.tvz.co.tz/tvz.html |date=3 July 2013 }}</ref> following an enactment of an act to make it a public corporation, monitored under the Ministry of Finance by the treasurer registrar.

Zanzibar has one AM radio station<ref>[http://www.radio-africa.org/am/fm.php?itu=Tanzania&region=zbw AM radio stations in Tanzania: Directory of AM radio stations in Zanzibar West region] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221632/http://www.radio-africa.org/am/fm.php?itu=Tanzania&region=zbw |date=3 March 2016 }}</ref> and 21 FM radio stations.<ref>[http://www.radio-africa.org/fm/reg.php?itu=Tanzania FM radio stations in Tanzania] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304033728/http://www.radio-africa.org/fm/reg.php?itu=Tanzania |date=4 March 2016 }}</ref>

In terms of [[landline]] communications, Zanzibar is served by the [[Tanzania Telecommunications Company Limited]] and Zantel Tanzania.

Almost all mobile and Internet companies serving mainland Tanzania are also available in Zanzibar.

=== Education ===
[[File:Zanzibar 2012 06 06 4220 (7592226526).jpg|thumb|left|Institute of Marine Sciences, [[UDSM]]]]
In 2000, there were 207 government schools and 118 privately owned schools in Zanzibar.<ref name="sacmeq">{{cite web |url=http://www.sacmeq.org/education-zanzibar.htm |title=Education in Zanzibar – Southern and Eastern African Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality |publisher=Sacmeq.org |access-date=4 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702114713/http://www.sacmeq.org/education-zanzibar.htm |archive-date=2 July 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Zanzibar has three fully accredited Universities: [[Zanzibar University]], the [[State University of Zanzibar]] (SUZA) and Sumait University (previously University College of Education, Chukwani).<ref>[http://www.tcu.go.tz/universities.html Tanzania Commission for Universities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619083810/http://www.tcu.go.tz/universities.html |date=19 June 2009 }}</ref>

SUZA was established in 1999, and is located in Stone Town, in the buildings of the former Institute of Kiswahili and Foreign Language (TAKILUKI).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.suza.ac.tz/ |title=SUZA website |publisher=Suza.ac.tz |access-date=4 April 2011 |archive-date=20 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520105258/http://www.suza.ac.tz/ |url-status=dead}}</ref> It is the only public institution for higher learning in Zanzibar, the other two institutions being private. In 2004, the three institutions had a total enrollment of 948 students, of whom 207 were female.<ref>[http://zanzibar.go.tz/10%20Higher%20education.php Higher education – zanzibar.go.tz] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707084022/http://zanzibar.go.tz/10%20Higher%20education.php |date=7 July 2010 }}</ref>

The primary and secondary education system in Zanzibar is slightly different from that of the Tanzanian mainland. On the mainland, education is only compulsory for the seven years of primary education, while in Zanzibar an additional three years of secondary education are compulsory and free.<ref name=sacmeq/> Students in Zanzibar score significantly less on standardized tests for reading and mathematics than students on the mainland.<ref name=sacmeq/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sacmeq.org/education-zanzibar.htm |title=Tanzania entry – SACMEQ |publisher=Sacmeq.org |access-date=4 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702114713/http://www.sacmeq.org/education-zanzibar.htm |archive-date=2 July 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, [[national service]] after secondary education was necessary, but it is now voluntary and few students volunteer. Most choose to seek employment or attend teacher's colleges.

The [[IIT Madras]] set up a campus in Zanzibar, which began classes for the first batch in November 2023.

=== Sports ===
[[File:A bird's view of Amaan Stadium in Zanzibar.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Amaan Stadium in Zanzibar]]

[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Zanzibar, overseen by the [[Zanzibar Football Association]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tanzaniasports.com/?p=3115 |title=? |access-date=11 August 2010 |date=8 September 2009 |archive-date=12 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230112064600/https://www.tanzaniasports.com/zfa-set-date-for-premier-league/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Zanzibar is an associate member of the [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF), but not of [[FIFA]]. This means that the [[Zanzibar national football team]] is not eligible to enter national CAF competitions, such as the [[African Nations Cup]], but Zanzibar's football clubs get representation at the [[CAF Confederation Cup]] and the [[CAF Champions League]].

The national team participates in [[non-FIFA Football]] tournaments such as the [[FIFI Wild Cup]], and the [[ELF Cup]]. Because Zanzibar is not a member of [[FIFA]], their team is not eligible for the [[FIFA World Cup]].

The Zanzibar Football Association also has a [[Zanzibar Premier League|Premier League]] for the top clubs, which was created in 1981. The teams also participate in the FA knockout competition, [[Zanzibari Cup]] and the [[Mapinduzi Cup]], a knockout competition organized in early January between 6–13 January to mark the [[Zanzibar Revolution Day|revolution day]] (12 January).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Simba face Tusker in Mapinduzi Cup |url=https://supersport.com/football/tanzania/news/121228/Simba_face_Tusker_in_Mapinduzi_Cup |access-date=2021-08-16 |website=supersport.com |language=en |archive-date=16 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210816160005/https://supersport.com/football/tanzania/news/121228/Simba_face_Tusker_in_Mapinduzi_Cup |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Cricket]] was historically popular in Zanzibar. In the 1950s and 1960s, the island hosted touring teams from England, India, Pakistan, South Africa and Uganda,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/88/4778_misc.html |title=Other matches played on Scyyid Khalifa Ground, Zanzibar |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=22 November 2022 |archive-date=22 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221122103634/https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/88/4778_misc.html |url-status=live }}</ref> but the sport declined following the 1964 revolution. Zanzibar contributed some players to the [[East Africa cricket team]] in the late 20th century. Efforts to revive the game in the 21st century have been led by Indian firms, with plans announced in 2022 for an international-grade cricket ground in [[Fumba]] with the support of the Zanzibar government.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://zjcbf.or.tz/2022/06/16/new-efforts-to-revive-cricket-in-zanzibar/ |title=New efforts to revive cricket in Zanzibar |newspaper=Zan Journal |date=16 June 2022 |accessdate=22 November 2022 |archive-date=8 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221208172352/https://zjcbf.or.tz/2022/06/16/new-efforts-to-revive-cricket-in-zanzibar/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Since 1992, there has also been [[judo]] in Zanzibar. The founder, Tsuyoshi Shimaoka, established a team that participates in national and international competitions. In 1999, Zanzibar Judo Association (Z.J.A.) was registered and became an active member of the Tanzania Olympic Committee {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} and International Judo Federation.
