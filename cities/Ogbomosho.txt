==History==
Ọlábánjọ Ògúnlọlá Ògúndìran was of Ibariba descent.  He and his wife, [[Esau|Esuu]], built their hut by the side of the [[Ajagbo|Àjàgbọn]] tree.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Reporters |first=Emporium |date=2020-03-27 |title=Origin of Ogbomoso, Oyo state |url=https://emporiumreporters.com.ng/origin-of-ogbomoso-oyo-state/ |access-date=2023-06-10 |website=Emporium Reporters |language=en-US}}</ref>

According to an early missionary, "Ògbómọ̀ṣọ́ in 1891 was a walled city, the gates of which were closely watched by day and securely closed by night. The town, [[picturesque]] and well watered was isolated from the rest of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba towns]]. Political relations were maintained with the Ibadans, for the country depended on its security on the warriors of Ògbómọ̀ṣọ́ and [[Ikirun]]...The strength of Ògbómọ̀ṣọ́ lay in the wall and moat surrounding the town, and the warriors made full use of it by sitting close and tight.."<ref>Pinnock, 1917, p. [https://archive.org/stream/romancemissions00pinngoog#page/n50/mode/2up 43]-44</ref>

The area that is called Ògbómọ̀ṣọ́ today is between Igbọ́n and Ìrẹṣà—Arẹṣà to the west; Oníkòyí to the East; Olúgbọ́n to the north; and Tìmì of Ẹdẹ to its south direction—according to Ògbómọ̀ṣọ́ History and Origin Documentary by Israel Ayanwuyi.

Ògúnlọlá (later Ṣọ̀ún) noticed smoke oozing from some nearby locations. He took courage and approached these places and discovered other hunters. There is no more Baálẹ̀ Akandíẹ̀.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Reporters|first=Emporium|title=Origin of Ogbomoso, Oyo state|url=https://emporiumreporters.com.ng/origin-of-ogbomoso-oyo-state/|access-date=2021-09-18|website=Emporium Reporters|date=27 March 2020 |language=en-US}}</ref>


Ogunlola, after the discovery of these hunters, took the initiative to invite them to form the Alongo Society. The primary objectives of the society were:
defence against Sunmoni (slave prowlers) raids
group hunting of wild animals, and
mutual assistance.
After each day's hunting, they retired to Ogunlola's hut where they were treated to beans and other meals and were served with Sekete wine brewed by Ogunlola's wife from fermented guinea corn. They also engaged in discussing current affairs and planning.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Esuu, the wife of Ogunlola, introduced the [[worship]] of Orisapopo to Ogbomosho. The worshippers were distinguished by white beads worn round their necks and wearing of white dresses only. Drinking of [[palm wine]] was forbidden to them. The name Orisapopo was probably derived from the fact that Ogunlola's hut was on the northsouthern route, therefore the Orisala being worshipped in the hut was named "Orisapopo" ([[Idolatry|idol]] by the highway). The importance and influence of 'Orisapopo' among the citizens of Ogbomoso is immense. It can be described as the patron Òrìṣà of Ògbómọ̀ṣọ́.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-03-13|title=The Full History of Ogbomoso, Oyo State, Nigeria|url=https://mywovenwords.com/2019/03/the-full-history-of-ogbomoso.html|access-date=2021-09-18|website=MY WOVEN WORDS|language=en-GB}}</ref>


During the time, the Ibaribas, under the leadership of Elemoso, attacked Oyo-Ile near Ilorin city.  Elemoso caused a devastating havoc among the Oyo people, so much that they feared him in battle. Elemoso consequently laid total siege on Oyo, causing famine and untold hardship among the people.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

[[Alaafin]] was so impressed by Ogunlola's prowess that he, the Alaafin, requested Ogunlola to stay in the capital (Oyo-Ile) instead of returning to his settlement. Ogunlola politely declined saying "Ejeki a ma se ohun" meaning "let me manage the that place." His majesty, the Alaafin, granted Ogunlola's wish to return to his settlement. This was later contracted to Ogbomoso.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

Eventually, the authority of Ogunlola became greater and more respected. His compound by the Ajagbon tree then became the Soun's palace and a rallying point for all Ogbomoso citizens.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

Ogbomosho, because of her strategic location, quickly grew from a village status to a medium size town. Her people were also renown warriors. During the Fulani wars of the 19th century, many towns and villages (about 147) were deserted while their people took refuge in Ogbomosho. The influx of people further enhanced the size and strength of the town.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ogbomoso.net/history.html |title=History of Ogbomosoland, Nigeria |access-date=2016-03-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123182935/http://www.ogbomoso.net/history.html |archive-date=2016-11-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Alagba the sacred tortoise===
Alagba is believed to have been born in the year 1675 in the old Oyo town, which is now being referred to as Ogbomoso. He was reputedly said to have been brought from the forest by the third Soun of Ogbomoso, Oba Ikumoyede who ruled from 1770 until 1797.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} In deference to its age, it is called Alagba, which means "the elderly one" in Yoruba. In Ogbomoso, where the legendary tortoise lumbers about in the palatial grounds of the king, it is almost a sacrilege to refer to Alagba as a mere tortoise. The tortoise played host to many monarchs in Ogbomoso in the past.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

The sacred [[tortoise]], which was believed to be the oldest in [[Africa]], was sick for a few days before her demise on 5 October 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-10-14|title=Does this photo really show a 344-year-old tortoise?|url=https://observers.france24.com/en/20191014-debunked-344-year-old-tortoise|access-date=2021-09-18|website=The Observers - France 24|language=en}}</ref>

The palace household, Ogbomoso community and stakeholders in the tourism sector are reportedly mourning{{when|date=October 2020}} Alagba's passage because of the great impact left behind. Plans are underway to preserve Alagba's body for historical records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://community.vanguardngr.com/forum/topics/12-things-to-know-about-the-oldest-tortoise-in-africa-alagb|title=12 things to know about the oldest tortoise in Africa, Alagba}}</ref>( by Timothy copy )

The founder of Ogbomoso, Soun Olabanjo Ogunlola Ogundiran, was the first Soun of Ogbomoso. He had 5 sons, Lakale, Kekere, Esuo, Eiye and Jogioro.
