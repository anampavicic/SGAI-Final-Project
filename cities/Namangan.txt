'''Namangan''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|n|æ|m|ə|ŋ|ˈ|ɡ|æ|n}} is a district-level city in eastern [[Uzbekistan]]. It is the administrative, economic, and cultural center of [[Namangan Region]].<ref name=class>{{cite web|url=https://stat.uz/uploads/docs/soato(mhobt)_2020.xlsx|title=Classification system of territorial units of the Republic of Uzbekistan|language=uz, ru|date=July 2020|publisher=The State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on statistics}}</ref> Namangan is located in the northern edge of the [[Fergana Valley]], less than 30&nbsp;km from the [[Kyrgyzstan]] border. The city is served by [[Namangan Airport]].

Namangan has been an important craft and trade center in the Fergana Valley since the 17th century. Many factories were built in the city during [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times. During [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]], industrial production in Namangan increased fivefold compared with that of the 1920s. Currently, Namangan is mainly a center for light industry, especially in food.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Namangan travel guide|url=https://caravanistan.com/uzbekistan/ferghana-valley/namangan/|access-date=2021-04-27|website=Caravanistan|date=27 April 2021 |language=en-US}}</ref> The officially registered population of the city was 668,600 in 2022.<ref>Namangan viloyatining 2022 yil yanvar-sentyabr oylari bo‘yicha demografik holati tahlili, www.review.uz</ref> [[Uzbeks]] form the largest ethnic group.

== History ==
The city takes its name from the local [[salt]] mines (in {{langx|fa|نمک‌کان}} (''namak kan'') — "a salt mine").<ref name="Lovell-HoareLovell-Hoare2013">{{cite book|last1=Lovell-Hoare|first1=Sophie|last2=Lovell-Hoare|first2=Max|title=Uzbekistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qF6PJda90gYC&pg=PA111|date=8 July 2013|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-461-7|page=111}}</ref> [[Babur]] mentioned the village of Namangan in his memoirs ''[[Baburnama]]''.<ref name="OʻzSE">{{cite encyclopedia|editor-first=Ibrohim|editor-last=Moʻminov|encyclopedia=Oʻzbek sovet ensiklopediyasi|title=Namangan|language=uz|year=1976|volume=7|location=Toshkent|pages=527–528}}</ref> In his book ''A brief History of the Khanate of Kokand'' ({{langx|ru|Краткая история Кокандского ханства}}) ([[Kazan]], 1886), the [[Russians|Russian]] ethnographer Vladimir Petrovich Nalivkin wrote that Namangan is mentioned in legal documents dating back to 1643.<ref name="OʻzSE"/>

The city of Namangan dates back to the 17th cent. A local salt miner's settlement (naman kann) appeared in the north of the Ferghana valley. The inhabitants of Aksikent (Ahsykenta) migrated here in the 17th century after the destructive earthquakes. Aksikent is the old city that was once the center of the valley of Fergana. Furthermore, the migration of people from other places of present-day Namangan region and partly from [[East Turkestan]] created the population of present-day Namangan. The city was the province's administrative centre in the middle of the 18th century (viloyat).

Namangan, like many other cities in the [[Fergana]] valley, was originally populated by [[Sogdia|Sogdian people]], although it later became a [[Persian language|Persian]] speaking city; the local variety of Persian became known as the [[Tajik language]]. An influx of [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking people into the region, starting in late [[medieval]] times, led to [[turkification]]. While Namangan still had a [[Tajik people|Tajik]] majority until the middle of the 19th century, identification of its residents with [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] rather than [[Iranian peoples|Iranian cultures]] has increased. By the late 20th century, most residents of Namangan speak [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]],{{Citation needed|reason=No official or unofficial sources have this fact|date=July 2018}} albeit with a significant Tajik-speaking minority.

Politically, Namangan became a part of the [[Uyghur Empire]] of the [[Karakhanid]] State and was known to have been a settlement in the 15th century. The residents of the ancient city of [[Akhsikat]], which was severely damaged by an [[earthquake]], moved to the then-village of Namangan in 1610.<ref name="EL">{{cite encyclopedia | year = 1988 | title = Namangan | encyclopedia = Ensiklopedik lugʻat | publisher = Oʻzbek sovet ensiklopediyasi | location = Toshkent | language = uz | id = 5-89890-002-0 | page = 554 | volume = 1

===As part of the Russian Empire===
Endless intrigues, coups and ensuing unrest led Namangan to join the uprising against [[Muhammad Khudayar Khan]] between 1873 and 1876.

Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], supporting Khudayar Khan, sent troops to suppress the uprising. On September 26, 1875, General [[Mikhail Skobelev|M. D. Skobelev]] crossed the [[Syr Darya]] and occupied the city.

However, a month later (in October) the rebels captured Namangan, and the Russian [[garrison]], fortified in the [[citadel]], with difficulty repulsed the [[Rebellion|rebel]] attacks.

Then Skobelev pulled up additional forces and subjected Namangan to an artillery [[bombardment]], knocking the rebels out of the city and finally joining it to the [[Russian Empire]].

After the territory of the [[Khanate of Kokand]] was incorporated into the empire, the city became the center of Namangan district of [[Fergana Oblast]].

With the accession to Russia, industrial, commercial and banking capital began to penetrate [[Central Asia]] at a rapid pace. According to [[statistics]], in 1892, 28 different enterprises were operating in [[Namangan District|Namangan district]], employing 704 workers.

The [[cotton]] processing industry developed rapidly. The largest scale of production was characterized by 20 cotton ginning plants, which produced 81.5% of the total gross industrial output.

In connection with the development of the cotton processing industry, the [[demand]] for raw cotton increased enormously. In 1892 the gross cotton [[harvest]] in the county amounted to 22,600 tons from 21,500 hectares, the yield was 10.5 [[Quintal|quintals]].

Namangan was hit by a destructive [[earthquake]] in 1926 which killed 34 people, injured 72, and destroyed 4,850 houses.<ref>{{cite book|title=The World Almanac and Book of Facts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AGc3AAAAMAAJ|year=1928|publisher=Newspaper Enterprise Association|page=145}}</ref>

Since Uzbekistan's independence in 1991, Namangan has gained a reputation for Islamic revivalism, with many mosques and schools funded by organizations from Middle Eastern countries, including the extremist [[Wahhabi]] sect from [[Saudi Arabia]] that produced [[jihadist]] [[terrorists]] like Juma [[Namangani]] who fought and died in support of the Afghan [[Taliban]] and the [[Al Qaeda]].<ref name="HughesSasse2002">{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=James|last2=Sasse|first2=Gwendolyn|title=Ethnicity and Territory in the Former Soviet Union: Regions in Conflict|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7vjb-0eZ-wcC&pg=PA185|date=January 2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7146-5226-9|page=185}}</ref><ref name="Melvin2000">{{cite book|last=Melvin|first=Neil J.|title=Uzbekistan: Transition to Authoritarianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tuh4AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA55|date=30 May 2000|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-135-28751-1|page=55}}</ref> This has also translated into political opposition against the secular government of Uzbekistan.

=== Babur Park ===
[[File:Bobur Park, Namandan, Uzbekistaan..jpg|thumb|Babur Park]]
Located in the centre of the city, Babur Park was created in the late 19th century as the private garden of Namangan's Russian governor, but it is now open to the public. The park is named after [[Babur|Emperor Babur]], who was born in the [[Fergana Valley]], and it is known for its many old chinor trees.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Ibbotson|first=Sophie|title=Uzbekistan|publisher=Bradt Guides Ltd|year=2020|isbn=9-781784-771089|location=United Kingdom|pages=136–137}}</ref>

=== Mullah Kyrgyz Madrasa ===
[[File:Moellah Kirigizmadrassa.jpg|thumb|Mullah Kyrgyz Madrasa]]
The Mullah Kyrgyz Madrassa, built 1910, is named after a local architect, Usto Kyrgyz. Founded by a wealthy cotton magnate from Namangan, it was closed by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] and spent much of the 20th century as a literary museum.<ref name=":0" /> The [[Madrasa|madrassa]] was restored by local residents following independence and it is listed as an historic monument.

The madrassa's [[minaret]]s and portal have been completely restored, and the white, blue, yellow, and green mosaic tiles are particularly beautiful. There is carved woodwork on both the ceilings and the columns, including some finely carved [[calligraphy]]. Inside is a small courtyard surrounded by 35 rooms, which would have housed nearly 150 students.

=== Khodjamni Kabri Mausoleum and Khodja Amin Mosque ===
The Khodjamni Kabri Mausoleum and neighbouring Khodja Amin Mosque both date from the 1720s and are the work of local architect Usto Muhammad Ibrahim.<ref name=":0" /> They have both recently been renovated. Opened on all four sides, the portal-domed mosque hosts intricate terracotta tilework which was produced using a method which was commonplace in the 12th century but had disappeared in the [[Fergana Valley]].<ref name=":0" /> The buildings are open for prayer, but only men may enter.

=== Ota Valikhon Tur Mosque ===
Built in 1915, the Ota Valikhon Tur Mosque is located 1&nbsp;km east of Namangan's bazaar. Arabic calligraphy adorns the brickwork on the exterior, with gorgeous star-shaped carvings. The large domes are decorated with blue mosaic stripes. This mosque was linked with the controversial Wahhabi sect during the 1990s and received funding from Saudi Arabia before it was closed by the Uzbek government.<ref name=":0" /> It is now a gallery of the Namangan Artists’ Union, displaying the work of local artists.<ref name=":0" />

== Demographics ==
With a population of 644,800 (2021),<ref name=namstat/> Namangan is Uzbekistan's second-largest city by population. Between 2016 and 2017, the population rose by almost 100,000,<ref name=namstat/> partly due to a change of boundaries between the city and the neighbouring districts.<ref name=lexuz>[https://lex.uz/docs/2972064 Decree 31.05.2016 № 179], LexUZ.</ref> [[Uzbeks]] are the largest ethnic group.
