'''Moers''' ({{IPA|de|ˈmœʁs|-|De-Moers.ogg}}; older form: ''Mörs''; [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Murse'', ''Murs'' or ''Meurs'') is a German [[List of cities and towns in Germany|city]] on the western bank of the [[Rhine]], close to [[Duisburg]]. Moers belongs to the district of [[Wesel (district)|Wesel]].

== History ==
{{stack|[[File:Murs.jpg|thumb|The County of Moers in 1635]]}}
Known earliest from 1186, the [[county of Moers]] was an independent principality within the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

During the [[Eighty Years' War]] it was alternately captured by Spanish and Dutch troops, as it bordered the Upper Quarter of [[Guelders]]. During the war it [[Siege of Meurs (1597)|finally fell]] to [[Maurice of Orange]]. As it was separated from the [[Dutch Republic]] by [[Spanish Netherlands|Spanish]] [[Upper Guelders]] it did not become an integral part of the Republic, though Dutch troops were stationed there.

After the death of [[William III of England|William III of Orange]] in 1702, Moers was inherited by the king of [[Prussia]]. All Dutch troops and civil servants were expelled.

In 1795 it was annexed by France. At the [[Congress of Vienna]], in 1815 it was returned to Prussia and in 1871 it became part of the [[German Empire]].
