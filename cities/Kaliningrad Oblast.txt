'''Kaliningrad Oblast''' ({{langx|ru|Калининградская область|translit=Kaliningradskaya oblastʹ}}) is the westernmost [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of the [[Russian Federation]], in [[Central and Eastern Europe]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Żegota |first=Krzysztof |date=2017 |title=The Kaliningrad Oblast of the Russian Federation as a Geopolitical Wedge of Russia in Central and Eastern Europe: Regional, State and International Context |url=http://cejsh.icm.edu.pl/cejsh/element/bwmeta1.element.ojs-issn-1898-4509-year-2017-issue-1__25_-article-c5a0a97f-40fb-3352-a6d9-dbe8422c622f/c/28-8214bfb6-0154-47c2-b112-a1eb83b8c0f0.pdf.pdf |website=University of Warmia and Mazury |access-date=3 March 2024 |archive-date=3 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240303033054/http://cejsh.icm.edu.pl/cejsh/element/bwmeta1.element.ojs-issn-1898-4509-year-2017-issue-1__25_-article-c5a0a97f-40fb-3352-a6d9-dbe8422c622f/c/28-8214bfb6-0154-47c2-b112-a1eb83b8c0f0.pdf.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> It is a [[Enclave and exclave|semi-exclave]] situated on the [[Baltic Sea]]. The oblast is surrounded by two [[European Union]] and [[NATO]] members: [[Poland]] to the south and [[Lithuania]] to the north and east. The largest city and [[administrative centre]] of the province ([[Oblasts of Russia|oblast]]) is the city of [[Kaliningrad]], formerly known as [[Königsberg]]. Half of the population of the oblast lives in Kaliningrad City proper. The port city of [[Baltiysk]] is Russia's only port on the Baltic Sea that remains ice-free in winter. Kaliningrad Oblast had a population of roughly 1&nbsp;million in the [[2021 Russian census|Russian Census of 2021]].<ref name="2010Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2021Census}}</ref> The area of Kaliningrad oblast is 15,125 square kilometers (5,840 square miles).

The territory was formerly the northern part of the [[Provinces of Prussia|Prussian province]] of [[East Prussia]]; the remaining southern part of the province is today part of the [[Warmian–Masurian Voivodeship]] in Poland. With the defeat of [[Nazi Germany]] in [[World War II]], the territory was annexed to the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] by the [[Soviet Union]]. Following the [[Aftermath of World War II|post-war]] migration and [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–1950)|flight and expulsion of Germans]], the territory was populated with Soviet citizens, mostly [[Russians]].

==History==
The territory of what is now the Kaliningrad Oblast used to be inhabited by the [[Old Prussians]] and other [[Western Balts]], prior to the [[Teutonic Order|Teutonic]] conquest in the early [[Late Middle Ages]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last=Matulevičius |first=Algirdas |title=Prūsija |trans-title=Prussia |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/prusija/ |access-date=2022-05-13 |website=[[Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija|VLE]] |language=lt |archive-date=7 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231107210515/https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/prusija/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Afterwards, it was settled by [[Germans]] (especially the western part), [[Lithuanians]] (especially [[Lithuania Minor]]) and [[Polish people|Poles]] (especially [[History of Poles in Königsberg|Königsberg]], {{langx|pl|Królewiec}}, and the current southern border strip). The Old Prussians became extinct due to [[Germanisation]] in the first half of the 18th century.<ref name=":3" /> The Lithuanian-inhabited areas of the Teutonic State were known as [[Lithuania Minor]], which encompassed all of modern Kaliningrad Oblast until the 18th century.<ref name=":3" />

===Early modern period===
After the [[Polish–Teutonic War (1519–1521)|Teutonic Order lost the war of 1519–1521 with Poland]], the Teutonic Order remained a vassal of the Kingdom of Poland.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |last=Matulevičius |first=Algirdas |title=Albrechtas Brandenburgietis |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/albrechtas-brandenburgietis/ |access-date=2022-05-13 |website=[[Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija|VLE]] |language=lt |archive-date=25 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220925005419/https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/albrechtas-brandenburgietis/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1525, Grand Master [[Albert, Duke of Prussia|Albert of Brandenburg]] [[German mediatisation|secularized]] the Teutonic Order's Prussian branch and established himself as ruler of the [[Duchy of Prussia]], the first Protestant state in Europe.<ref name=":2" /> Königsberg was the residence of the [[Duke of Prussia]] from 1525 until 1701,<ref name=":0" /> and was the Duchy of Prussia's capital until 1660, when the capital moved to [[Berlin]].<ref name=":0" />

Polish and Lithuanian culture blossomed in Königsberg, with the city being the place of publication of the first Polish and Lithuanian-language [[cathechism]]s (by [[Jan Seklucjan]] and [[Catechism of Martynas Mažvydas|Martynas Mažvydas]]), the first Polish translation of the [[New Testament]], ''[[Grammatica Litvanica]]'', the first Lithuanian grammar book, and the [[Albertina University]] being the second oldest university of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], after receiving a royal [[privilege (law)|privilege]] from King [[Sigismund II Augustus]] in 1560.<ref name=wp>{{cite magazine|last=Podbereski|first=Wacław|year=2010|title=Królewiec – Koenigsberg – Kaliningrad|magazine=Znad Wilii|volume=4 |language=pl|issue=44|pages=113–114|issn=1392-9712}}</ref> Polish printing continued for centuries with the last Polish publication in 1931.<ref name=wp/>

In 1577, the Duke of Prussia forbade [[serfdom|serfs]]—who were mostly Old Prussians, Lithuanians, and [[Masurians]]—to leave the land that was the property of the German knights who became proprietary nobles.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Matulevičius |first=Algirdas |title=Prūsijos kunigaikštystė |trans-title=Duchy of Prussia |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/prusijos-kunigaikstyste/ |access-date=2022-05-13 |website=[[Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija|VLE]] |language=lt |archive-date=5 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221205040022/https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/prusijos-kunigaikstyste/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1618, the Duchy merged with the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] to form [[Brandenburg-Prussia]],<ref name=":1" /> remaining under Polish suzerainty until 1660.

====Napoleonic occupation====
After the defeats of [[Battle of Jena–Auerstedt|Jena–Auerstedt]], the Kingdom of Prussia was invaded and [[Fall of Berlin (1806)|Berlin was occupied]] by the French. The Court of Prussia fled to Königsberg, asking for Russian help. Russia intervened, leading to the bloody [[Battle of Eylau]] and [[Battle of Friedland]] in 1807. Following a French victory in the latter, both sides signed the [[Treaties of Tilsit]].<ref name="auto1"/>

====Historical ethnic and religious structure====
In 1817, East Prussia had 796,204 [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Protestants]], 120,123 [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], 2,389 [[Jews]], and 864 [[Mennonites]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/en/view/bsb10001094?page=57|title=Übersicht der Bodenfläche und Bevölkerung des Preußischen Staates: aus den für das Jahr 1817 mtlich eingezogenen Nachrichten|last=Hoffmann|first=Johann Gottfried|publisher=Decker|year=1818|location=Berlin|page=51|access-date=17 January 2023|archive-date=26 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326032011/https://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/en/view/bsb10001094?page=57|url-status=live}}</ref>

====German culture and Germanization====
In the 19th century, East Prussia was commonly viewed by German commentators as culturally backwards and a part of the "German mission in the East" rather than a core German territory. Pan-Germanist politician [[:de:Ernst Hasse (Politiker)|Ernst Hasse]] criticised the lack of folk identity and [[imagined community]]: "It is the case that there is almost no common folk identity [Landsmannschaften] among the Poseners and Prussians at all. [...] Who can recognise a Posener or Prussian by dialect and character? Distinct features hardly exist."<ref name="tilse">{{cite book |author=Mark Jonathan Breedon Tilse |title=Nations in synthesis: the ideology and practices of transnationalism in the Prussian East, 1871-1914 |type= Doctoral thesis |publisher=University of London |date=2008 |id=PQ ETD 591343 |page=63 }}</ref> While the north of East Prussia was overwhelmingly German, the south was majority Slavic and mostly composed of Poles and [[Masurians]].

An East German newspaper ''Thorner Zeitung'' reported in 1871 that "not only Polish Catholics, but also a great number of German Catholics, are willing to vote for a Polish party candidate".<ref>{{harvnb|Mark Jonathan Breedon Tilse|2008|pp=177–178}}</ref>

By the end of the 19th century, East Prussia had a significant Polish minority, and German nationalist circles warned of the prospect of [[Polonization]] of East Prussia.<ref name="srokowski">{{cite book |last1=Srokowski |first1=Stanisław |author-link=Stanisław Srokowski |title=East Prussia |publisher=The Baltic Pocket Library |location=Toruń |date=1934 |page=22 |url=https://kpbc.umk.pl/Content/248439/PDF/Gromadzenie_POPC_027_75.pdf |access-date=27 July 2023 |archive-date=27 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230727021352/https://kpbc.umk.pl/Content/248439/PDF/Gromadzenie_POPC_027_75.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> The perceived weakness of Germanness of East Prussia was also reinforced by the [[Ostflucht]], as East Prussia suffered from both under-industrialisation and rural overpopulation. After 1876, farm prices in East Prussia fell by 20 percent, which encouraged local landowners to hire foreign workers from [[Congress Poland]], incidentally strengthening the Polish element in the region. The increased Slavic immigration to the region generated by the requirement of the [[Junker|Junkers]] for cheap labour and better economic conditions in West Germany caused many German inhabitants to leave the region.<ref>{{harvnb|Mark Jonathan Breedon Tilse|2008|p=42}}</ref> Most Germans moved to work in the industrial heartland of western Germany, while others migrated abroad. Poles and Lithuanians of East Prussia also had much higher birth-rate and natural increase rates than the Germans, and rarely emigrated.<ref name="Srokowski 1934 21–22">{{harvnb|Srokowski|1934|pp=21–22}}</ref> Discussing the situation in East Prussia, Polish geographer [[Stanisław Srokowski]] remarked:

{{Blockquote|text=The Poles who live in the southern and western parts of East Prussia and the Lithuanians of the north-west have succeeded better than the Germans in reconciling their mode of life with their earnings. This has, of course, led to a lower standard of life, but it has enabled them to adapt themselves to actual conditions and even to prosper where the Germans fail. Moreover, both these national minorities in East Prussia are bound to the soil by centuries of tradition: they are not comparative new-comers like the majority of the Germans there. For these reasons, the Poles and Lithuanians in that province hardly ever emigrate from the land of their birth, especially as the emigration in question is not so attractive for them as for the Germans: proceeding to central or western Germany, the former would really be going to a foreign country, amongst people not speaking their language and having other customs than theirs.<ref name="Srokowski 1934 21–22">{{harvnb|Srokowski|1934|pp=21–22}}</ref>}}

The Memel Territory ([[Klaipėda region]]), formerly part of northeastern East Prussia as well as Prussian Lithuania, was annexed by Lithuania in 1923. In 1938, Nazi Germany radically renamed about a third of the place names of this area, replacing [[Old Prussian language|Old Prussian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] names with newly invented German names.

====World War I====

In September 1914, after hostilities began between Germany on the one hand and France and Russia on the other, the German Army was about to seize Paris, and the French urged Russia to attack East Prussia. [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] launched a major attack, resulting in a Russian victory in the [[Battle of Gumbinnen]]. The Russian army arrived at the outskirts of the city of Königsberg but did not take it and settled at [[Insterburg]]. This Russian victory and East Prussia's occupation by Russia saved Paris by forcing the Germans to send many troops to their East provinces.<ref name="auto">Roqueplo O: La Russie et son Miroir..., 2018</ref> Later, Hindenburg and Ludendorff pushed Russia back at the [[battle of Tannenberg]], thereby liberating East Prussia from Russian troops.

====World War II====
During World War II, the {{ill|Hohenbruch concentration camp|de|KZ Hohenbruch}} was operated at modern [[Gromovo, Kaliningrad Oblast|Gromovo]] mostly for Polish prisoners, as well as several subcamps of the [[Stutthof concentration camp]], the Oflag 52, Oflag 60 and [[Dulag Luft]] [[German prisoner-of-war camps in World War II|prisoner-of-war camps]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Megargee|first1=Geoffrey P.|last2=Overmans|first2=Rüdiger|last3=Vogt|first3=Wolfgang|year=2022|title=The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos 1933–1945.

On 29 August 1944, Soviet troops reached the border of East Prussia. By January 1945, they had taken all of East Prussia except for the area around Königsberg. Many inhabitants fled west at this time. During the last days of the war, over two million people fled, anticipating imminent [[Red Army]] conquest, and were [[Evacuation of East Prussia|evacuated by sea]].

==== Soviet annexation ====
Initially, at the end of World War II in 1945, the current southern border strip passed under Polish control with Polish administration organized in the towns of [[Gierdawy]] and [[Bagrationovsk|Iławka]], however, the area was eventually annexed by the Soviet Union and included within the Kaliningrad Oblast.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Eberhardt|first=Piotr|year=2018|title=Kwestia podziału Prus Wschodnich w okresie II wojny światowej|journal=Przegląd Geograficzny|language=pl|volume=90|issue=4|page=610|doi=10.7163/PrzG.2018.4.4 |issn=0033-2143|url=https://rcin.org.pl/dlibra/docmetadata?showContent=true&id=68042 }}</ref>

Under the [[Potsdam Agreement]] of 1 August 1945, the city became part of the Soviet Union pending the final determination of territorial borders at an anticipated peace settlement. This final determination eventually took place on 12 September 1990 when the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany]] was signed. The excerpt from the initial agreement pertaining to the partition of East Prussia, including the area surrounding Königsberg, is as follows (note that Königsberg is spelt "Koenigsberg" in the original document):

<blockquote>'''VI. CITY OF KOENIGSBERG AND THE ADJACENT AREA'''<br />The Conference examined a proposal by the [[Politics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Government]] that pending the final determination of territorial questions at the peace settlement, the section of the western frontier of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics which is adjacent to the Baltic Sea should pass from a point on the eastern shore of the [[Gdańsk Bay|Bay of Danzig]] to the east, north of [[Braniewo|Braunsberg]]&nbsp;– [[Gołdap|Goldep]], to the meeting point of the frontiers of [[Lithuania]], the [[Poland|Polish Republic]] and [[East Prussia]].

The Conference has agreed in principle to the proposal of the Soviet Government concerning the ultimate transfer to the Soviet Union of the city of Koenigsberg and the area adjacent to it as described above, subject to expert examination of the actual frontier.

U.S. president [[Harry Truman]] and British prime minister [[Clement Attlee]] supported the proposal of the Conference at the forthcoming peace settlement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/1945/450802a.html|title=The Potsdam Declaration|access-date=April 2, 2009|archive-date=21 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210221123957/http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/1945/450802a.html|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>

In 1946, Königsberg was added as a [[enclave and exclave|semi-exclave]] to the [[Russian SFSR]] and renamed Kaliningrad, after the [[Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] of the USSR [[Mikhail Kalinin]]. Kalinin was unrelated to the city, and there were already cities named in honour of Kalinin in the Soviet Union, namely ''Kalinin'' (now Tver) and ''Kaliningrad'' (now [[Korolev, Moscow Oblast]]).<ref>[https://www.klgd.ru/city/history/almanac/a5_4.php Кёнигсберг мог стать Балтийском.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220201084522/https://www.klgd.ru/city/history/almanac/a5_4.php |date=1 February 2022 }} // klgd.ru</ref><ref>[https://www.klgd.ru/city/history/almanac/a8_5.php Кёнигсберг-Калининград.

The [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania|independence of Lithuania]] in 1990 and full [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 isolated Kaliningrad from the rest of Russia, having previously been joined by other Soviet republics. This isolation became more severe when both Poland and Lithuania joined [[NATO]] and [[Enlargement of the European Union|the European Union]] and imposed strict border controls on Kaliningrad Oblast. All military and civilian land links between the region and the rest of Russia now must pass through members of NATO and the EU. Thus far, the EU has rejected Russian proposals for visa-free travel between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia. Travel arrangements based on the ''Facilitated Transit Document (FTD)'' and ''Facilitated Rail Transit Document (FRTD)'' have been made.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.euro.lt/en/lithuanias-membership-in-the-eu/transit-from-to-kaliningrad-region/

After 1991, some ethnic Germans emigrated to the area, such as [[Volga Germans]] from other parts of Russia and [[Kazakhstan]]. These Germans are overwhelmingly Russian-speaking and as such were rejected for resettlement within Germany under Germany's new rules. A similar migration by [[Poles in Kaliningrad|Poles]] from the lands of the former [[Poles in the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] to the Kaliningrad Oblast occurred at this time as well. The situation has begun to change, albeit slowly. Germany, Lithuania, and Poland have renewed contact with Kaliningrad Oblast, through [[town twinning]] and other projects. This has helped to promote interest in the history and culture of the East Prussian and Lietuvininkai communities.

In July 2007, [[First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia|Russian First Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Sergei Ivanov]] declared that if US-controlled [[missile defense]] systems were deployed in Poland, then nuclear weapons might be deployed in Kaliningrad.

==Geography==
[[File:KALININGRAD FINAL.svg|thumb|Map of Kaliningrad Oblast]]
[[File:Angrapa.jpg|thumb|[[Angrapa River]]]]

Kaliningrad is the only Russian [[Baltic Sea]] port that is ice-free all year and hence plays an important role in the maintenance of the country's Baltic Fleet.

The oblast is mainly flat, as the highest point is the {{cvt|230|m|ft}} Gora Dozor hill near the [[tripoint]] of the [[Poland–Russia border]]/[[Lithuania–Russia border]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Kaliningrad Mountains |url=https://peakvisor.com/adm/kaliningrad.html |website=PeakVisor |language=en |access-date=8 February 2023 |archive-date=8 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230208002352/https://peakvisor.com/adm/kaliningrad.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

As a semi-exclave of Russia, it is surrounded by Poland ([[Pomeranian Voivodeship|Pomeranian]] and [[Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship]]s), Lithuania ([[Klaipėda County|Klaipėda]], [[Marijampolė County|Marijampolė]], and [[Tauragė County|Tauragė Counties]]) and the Baltic Sea. The end of the [[Neman (river)|river Neman]] forms part of the [[Lithuania–Russia border]].<!-- +[[Šešupė]] -->

Notable geographical features include the [[Curonian Lagoon]] (shared with Lithuania) and the [[Vistula Lagoon]] (shared with Poland). The oblast's largest river is the [[Pregolya River|Pregolya]]. The river starts as a [[confluence]] of the [[Instruch]] and the [[Angrapa]] and drains into the Baltic Sea through the Vistula Lagoon. Its length, strictly under the name "Pregolya", is {{Convert|123|km|mi|abbr=on}}; when including the Angrapa, is it {{Convert|292|km|mi|abbr=on}} long.

Major cities and towns include:

===Climate===
Kaliningrad Oblast has a climate gradually transitioning from [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] to [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] depending on distance from the [[Baltic Sea]] moderation. It remains very mild by Russian standards with winters above freezing without the hot summers associated with the Russian interior on similar latitudes. The local climate is slightly wetter than similar latitudes farther west, but infrequent ice days lead to low snow accumulation regardless.

===Natural resources===
More than 90% of the world's known [[amber]] deposits are in Kaliningrad Oblast .<ref>[http://science.enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/amber How Products Are Made: Amber] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811121944/http://science.enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/amber |date=11 August 2007 }}</ref> Because of this, many Russians refer to the region as "Amber Land" ({{Langx|ru|Янтарный Край|translit=Jantarny Krai}}). Until recently, raw amber was exported for processing to other countries. In 2013, the Russian government banned the export of raw amber in order to boost the amber processing industry in Russia.<ref>[https://leta.st/blog/2016/08/history-of-russian-amber-2/ "The History of Russian Amber, Part 2: From USSR to Russia"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315070511/https://leta.st/blog/2016/08/history-of-russian-amber-2/ |date=15 March 2018 }}, Leta.st</ref>

There are small oil reservoirs beneath the Baltic Sea not far from Kaliningrad's shore. Small-scale offshore exploration started in 2004. Poland, Lithuania, and some local [[NGO]]s voiced concerns about possible environmental effects.

===Fishing===

===Power generation===
[[File:Калининградская ТЭЦ-2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Combined heat and power]] plant 2]]

Average yearly power consumption in the Kaliningrad Oblast was 3.5 [[terawatt-hour]]s in 2004, of which local power generation provided just 0.235 terawatt-hours. The balance was imported from neighbouring countries. A new Kaliningrad power station was built in 2005, providing 50% of the oblast's energy needs. This station was expanded in 2010, making the oblast independent from electricity imports.

In 2008, planning began for the construction of two [[Kaliningrad Nuclear Power Plant|nuclear power reactors]], with costs estimated at €5&nbsp;billion (US$8&nbsp;billion).<ref>{{Cite news|date=17 April 2008|title=Kaliningrad plan for Baltic States market|work=World Nuclear News|url=https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Kaliningrad-plan-for-Baltic-States-market|access-date=31 May 2021|archive-date=2 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210602215042/https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Kaliningrad-plan-for-Baltic-States-market|url-status=live}}</ref> The project was suspended in May 2013.
