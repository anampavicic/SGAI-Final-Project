'''Vitória da Conquista''' is a [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] in [[Bahia]], [[Brazil]], that has a population of approximately 370,879 people as of 2022, according to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics). It is the third largest city in the state of Bahia, after [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] and [[Feira de Santana]].

Vitória da Conquista is known as simply "Conquista" by locals in order to differentiate it from the city of [[Vitória, Espírito Santo|Vitória]] in the state of Espírito Santo. It was named after [[Vitória da Conquista (Colony)|the colony of Vitória da Conquista]].

==History==
Vitória da Conquista was founded in 1783, after several battles against the native [[Aimoré|Imboré]] and [[Kamakan languages|Mongoió]] tribes by [[:pt:João Gonçalves da Costa|João Gonçalves da Costa]], born in [[Chaves, Portugal|Chaves]], [[Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro|Trás-os-Montes]], [[Portugal]].

Costa had served the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese crown]] during [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]]'s kingdom, fighting the natives, conquering their land, and attempting to [[Proselytism|convert]] them to [[Christianity]]. He founded the Arraial da Conquista ("Conquest Town") near the site of the last battles and began the building of a church in honour of the Holy Mother of Victory.

At the same time, João Gonçalves da Costa was ordered to lead the construction of two of the principal roads in the state of Bahia, one from Vitória da Conquista to the city of [[Ilhéus]] on the coast and another from Vitória da Conquista to the Jequitinhonha River in [[Minas Gerais]]. Today, the latter road has become part of the larger federal highway system, and is known as the ''Rio-Bahia'' — [[BR-116]].

In 2019, Vitória da Conquista was named the 10th most violent city in the world by the Citizens' Council for Public Security and Criminal Justice in Mexico.<ref>{{Cite web|date=1 June 2020|title=Metodología del ranking (2019) de las 50 ciudades más violentas del mundo|trans-title=Methodology of the 2019 ranking of the 50 most violent cities in the world|url=http://www.seguridadjusticiaypaz.org.mx/sala-de-prensa/1589-metodologia-del-ranking-2019-de-las-50-ciudades-mas-violentas-del-mundo|access-date=2020-06-06|website=Seguridad, Justicia y Paz|language=es-es}}</ref>

==Geography==
===Climate===
The city has a [[Oceanic climate|subtropical highland climate]] (''Cfb/Cfa/Cwb/Cwa'', according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]), relatively dry and moderated in temperature by the elevation. It closely borders a [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw''). The altitude of the city itself varies between 857 meters (2811&nbsp;feet) and 950 meters (3116&nbsp;feet). Precipitation from April to August is often characterized by fine, misty rain, while heavier rains fall from October to March. Winters (July through October) tend to lack much precipitation but are cool and humid, with cold air coming up to the plateau from the ocean and often producing fog.

Mean temperature varies from a low of 17.8&nbsp;°C (64&nbsp;°F) in July to 21.8&nbsp;°C (71&nbsp;°F) in March. Mean rainfall ranges from 17.9&nbsp;mm (.7&nbsp;inches) in July to 127.8&nbsp;mm (5&nbsp;inches) in December. (1961-1990 trends from Hong Kong Observatories).

The vegetation ranges from very dry and coarse (1,000 meters and above) to an array of grasses, ferns and palms at slightly lower elevations on the plateau. This is the coffee-growing elevation (MEDEIROS, Ruy H. A., Notas Críticas ao livro "O Município da Vitória" de Tranquilino Torres, p.&nbsp;87).
