'''Santiago''', officially the '''City of Santiago''' ({{langx|ilo|Siudad ti Santiago}}; {{langx|ibg|Siudad nat Santiago}}; {{langx|gad|Siudad na Santiago}}; {{langx|fil|Lungsod ng Santiago}}), is a 1st class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|independent component city]] in the [[Cagayan Valley]] region of the [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 148,580 people.{{PH census|current}}

It is formerly known as '''Carig''' during the time of the Spanish, it is located between the southwestern part of [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]] and the northwestern boundary of [[Quirino]] in northeastern [[Luzon]] island of the [[Philippines]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Santiago City Local Government Office|url=http://santiago-city.com/place/santiago-city-local-government-office/|publisher=Santiago-City.com Website|access-date=November 5, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105030607/http://santiago-city.com/place/santiago-city-local-government-office/|archive-date=November 5, 2013}}</ref> It is the gateway to the vast plains of [[Cagayan Valley]].

Santiago is situated {{convert|72|km}} south of [[Ilagan]], the provincial capital, and {{convert|326|km}} north of [[Metro Manila]]. The city sits on a vast area of predominantly flat and fertile land in the Cagayan Valley, surrounded by the Namamparang Mountains to the south, the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] to the east and the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera Mountain Range]] to the west alongside the [[Magat River]].

Despite being statistically grouped by the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]] and geographically located within the boundaries of the province of [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]], as well as part of the province's [[Legislative districts of Isabela|4th District]], Santiago is administratively and legally independent from the province as stated in Section 25 of the [[Philippine legal codes|Local Government Code]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Republic Act No. 7160 LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE OF 1991|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1991/ra_7160_1991.html|publisher=The LawPhil Project|access-date=November 5, 2013}}</ref> And also, it is the second most populous city in that province after the capital city of [[Ilagan]].

==Etymology==
Santiago was previously a native settlement discovered by the early Spanish missionaries at the bank of the old Carig River (now Diadi River) from which its original name, Carig, was derived. When the [[Spain|Spanish]] settled in, it was named Pueblo of Santiago Apostol de Carig, with [[Santiago (name)|Santiago]] as the Spanish name of [[James the Great|Saint James the Apostle]]. In the early 1950s, the Municipal President Vicente Carreon changed the name to simply Santiago.

==History== 
Carig was initially established in 1743 at the foothills of mount Dalayag between present-day Isabela and [[Nueva Vizcaya]]. A few years later, it was moved to its present location 15 kilometers away. Carig was also the site of a military garrison established by the Spaniards as a base for expeditions against unconquered tribes in present-day [[Ifugao]] and Quirino and to guard the mountain pass to Nueva Vizcaya.<ref>{{cite book |last=Salgado|first=Pedro|title=Cagayan Valley and Easter Cordillera: 1581-1898, Volume I |publisher=Rex Publishing |orig-date=2002|pages=577‚Äì580|chapter=Formation of Christian Towns in Diffun (Southern Isabela)|isbn=}}</ref>

The early inhabitants of Santiago were the [[Gaddang people|Gaddang]]s and the [[Ibanag people|Ibanag]]s.

Santiago was originally a part of the province of [[Cagayan]] (comprising the whole [[Cagayan Valley]] region), which was reorganized as a political subdivision in 1583 with Nueva Segovia (now [[Lal-lo]]) as its capital.

When the province of Nueva Vizcaya was created in 1839, Santiago became part of the new province. On May 1, 1856, when the province of Isabela was carved out by a Royal Decree, Santiago was among the towns relinquished to the newly created province. The first five barrios after the Cadastral survey in 1927 were Patul, Batal, Nabbuan, Buenavista and Dubinan.

It was said that there were only about three Filipino-owned sari-sari stores in Santiago in 1917. The settlers acquired most of their merchandise and other provisions from Chinese traders in [[Echague]], the landing zone for products intended for Santiago and other towns, owing to its proximity to the [[Cagayan River]].

It was when the Villaverde Trail was opened when things were set in motion. It facilitated the entry of immigrants from various provinces in [[Luzon]] to the Cagayan Valley and Santiago absorbed a sizable share of these travelers. The new route served as an impetus for growth and introduced new technologies and business opportunities, and made Santiago a melting pot of different cultures.

In 1942, during [[World War II]], Japanese forces occupied Santiago. In 1945, the town was liberated by the Filipino soldiers of the 1st, 2nd, 12th, 13th and 15th Infantry Division and the USAFIP-NL 11th Infantry Regiment of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|Philippine Commonwealth Army]], the 1st Constabulary Regiment of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] and the recognized guerrilla fighter units. Santiago survived through the war, although badly damaged, and from then on developed to become the leading trading and commercial city in Cagayan Valley.

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
On December 17, 1993, the bill converting Santiago into an independent component city was approved by the House of Representatives spearheaded by the then Mayor Jose "Pempe" Miranda. In the following year, the Senate Committee on Local Government approved another public hearing dated February 23, 1994.

On May 5, 1994, President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] signed Republic Act 7720. The plebiscite was held on July 6, 1994, showed that voters approved this conversion, making Santiago the first city in [[Cagayan Valley]] and 5th independent component city, after [[Cotabato City]], [[Dagupan]], [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga]], and [[Ormoc]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Perante|first=Caesar M.|date=June 30, 2018|title=Transforming Santiago City into an independent component city up north|url=https://businessmirror.com.ph/2018/06/30/transforming-santiago-city-into-an-independent-component-city-up-north/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190924194729/https://businessmirror.com.ph/2018/06/30/transforming-santiago-city-into-an-independent-component-city-up-north/|archive-date=September 24, 2019|access-date=July 11, 2021|website=BusinessMirror|language=en-PH}}</ref>

On February 14, 1998, Republic Act 8528 repealed this statute transforming it to a component city.<ref>{{Cite web|date=September 16, 1999|title=G.R. No. 133064|url=https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/1/59051|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915224918/http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/1/59051|archive-date=September 15, 2017|access-date=July 11, 2021|website=Supreme Court of the Republic of the Philippines}}</ref> On December 29, 1999, the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] struck down the law and restored Santiago's independent cityhood.

====Reversal attempts====
During the 13th Congress, House Bill No. 3709 which sought to amend certain sections of Republic Act No. 7720, was filed by [[Isabela's 4th congressional district|Isabela's 4th District]] Representative Anthony C. Miranda, but did not pass.<ref>{{cite web |title=House Bill No. 3709, 13th Congress of the Republic |url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/bills/house-bill-no-3709-13th-congress-republic |website=[[Senate of the Philippines]] |access-date=23 April 2024}}</ref>

==Geography==
The total land area of Santiago is 80% flat or nearly level land in the northwestern, eastern and western parts of the city. While adjacent areas have gently undulating and moderately rolling areas, and the remaining areas constitute steeply undulating and rolling lands. The Dariuk Hills is the highest point in the city.{{fact|date=June 2023}}

===Barangays===
