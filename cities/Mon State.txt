'''Mon State''' ({{langx|my|မွန်ပြည်နယ်}}, {{IPA-my|mʊ̀ɴ pjìnɛ̀|pron}}; {{langx|mnw|တွဵုရးဍုင်မန်|italics=no}}) is an administrative division of [[Myanmar]]. It lies between [[Kayin State]] to the east, the [[Andaman Sea]] to the west, [[Bago Region]] to the north and [[Tanintharyi Region]] to the south, also having a short border with [[Thailand]]'s [[Kanchanaburi Province]] at its south-eastern tip. The land area is {{cvt|12,155|km2}}. The [[Dawna Range]], running along the eastern side of the state in a NNW&ndash;SSE direction, forms a natural border with Kayin State. Mon State includes some small islands, such as [[Kalegauk]], [[Wa Kyun]] and [[Kyungyi Island]], along its {{cvt|566|km}} of coastline. The state's capital is [[Mawlamyaing|Mawlamyine]].

==History==
{{See also|Mon people|Mon kingdoms}}
Mon tradition holds that the [[Suwannaphum|Suwarnabhumi]] mentioned in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]] and the [[Dipavamsa|''Dîpavamsa'']] was their first kingdom (pronounced Suvanna Bhoum), founded around the port of [[Thaton]] in about 300 BC, however, this is disputed by scholars.

Oral tradition suggests that they had contact with [[Buddhism]] via seafaring as early as the 3rd century BCE, though definitely by the 2nd century BCE when they received an envoy of monks from [[Ashoka]]. The Mon converted to [[Theravada Buddhism]] sometime before the sixth century,<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16847/16847-h/16847-h.htm Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch], Vol. 3 by Sir Charles Eliot</ref> and they adopted the Indian [[Pali script]]. Much of the Mon's written records have been destroyed through wars. The Mons blended Indian and Mon cultures in a hybrid of the civilisations. By 825 they had firmly established themselves in southern and southeastern Myanmar and founded the cities of [[Bago, Myanmar|Bago]] (Pegu) and [[Thaton]]. By the mid-9th century, they had come to dominate all of southern Myanmar.

===Mon kingdoms===
{{main|Mon kingdoms}}
The first recorded kingdom that can undisputedly be attributed to the Mon was [[Dvaravati]] which prospered until around 1024 AD when their capital was ruled by the [[Khmer Empire]] and most of the inhabitants fled west to present-day Myanmar and eventually founded new kingdoms. These, too, eventually came under pressure from new ethnic groups arriving from the north.

===Advent of the British===
[[Lower Burma]], including what is now Mon State, was conquered by [[Great Britain]] in 1824 after the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]]. The Mon assisted the British in the war, in return for promises of their own leadership after the defeat of Burma. Hundreds of thousands of Mons who had migrated into [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] returned to their homeland when it came under British rule. However, British promises to restore the Mon Kingdom were never fulfilled. During colonial times, Moulmein had a substantial [[Anglo-Burmese]] population; an area of the city was known as 'Little England' due to the large Anglo-Burmese community. Nowadays this community has dwindled to a handful of families as most have left for the UK or Australia.

===Burmese independence===
In 1947, the Mon sought [[self-determination]] from the yet unformed [[Union of Burma]]. Burmese Prime Minister [[U Nu]] refused, saying that no separate national rights for the Mon should be contemplated. The Burmese army moved into areas claimed by the Mon nationalists and imposed rule by force which resulted in a civil war. Mon separatists formed the [[Mon Peoples Front]], which was later superseded by the [[New Mon State Party]] (NMSP) in 1962. Since 1949, the eastern hills of the state (as well as portions of Thaninthaya Division) have been under control of the NMSP and its military arm, the [[Mon National Liberation Front]] (MNLF). In addition to fighting the central government, the MNLF has fought the [[Karen people]] over control of lucrative border crossings into [[Thailand]].

In 1974, partially to assuage Mon [[separatist]] demands, the theoretically autonomous Mon State was created out of portions of [[Thaninthayi Division]] and [[Bago Division]]. Resistance continued until 1995, when NMSP and [[SLORC]] agreed a cease-fire. In 1996, the [[Mon Unity League]] was founded. SLORC troops continued to operate in defiance of the agreement.

== Geography ==
[[Image:MonStateMudon.jpg|thumb|250px|Limestone landscape near Mudon, south of Mawlamyaing.]]Bordering Bago Division in the south of Sittaung River Mouth, Kayin State in the east, Thailand and Taninthayi Division in the south and Andaman Sea and Gulf of Mottama in the West, Mon state is situated between latitudes 14°52′ north and 17°32′ north and longitudes 96°51′ east and 98°13′ east.

===Climate and weather===
Mon State has a tropical climate. It has temperate weather as it is located in the low latitude zone and near the sea. The state has only slight changes in temperature. The average temperature of Mawlamyine in January is {{cvt|78|°F}} and in April is {{cvt|85|°F}}. Annual rainfall in Mawlamyine is {{convert|190|in|m}} and in Thaton is {{convert|217|in|m}}. Rain is especially heavy in July and August.

==Economy==
{{References needed|section|date=July 2024|find=economy of Mon state}}
Mon State has a cultivated area of nearly {{cvt|4,500,000|acre}}, mostly under [[rice]]. The major secondary crop is [[rubber]]. Orchards and rubber plantations are found in the mountainous areas while Coastal fishing and related industries such as production of dried fish, [[fish sauce]] and [[agar-agar]] are in southern part, [[Ye, Mon State|Ye]] district. Production of [[Betel nut]] is also a sustaining business of Mon state, as the Mon peasants preserved their heredity land onwards along with the government regulations, however, there are some many parts of uncultivated crude land in the area closed to neighbour [[Karen state]]. Moreover, modern business development includes growing of [[cashew]] trees (acajoú, in Portuguese), from which they collect the cashew nut for market elsewhere.

[[Image:Mawlamyaingbridge.gif|thumb|240px|Opened in 2006, the Mawlamyine Bridge looks old-fashioned, but allows for north-south travel for trains, cars and pedestrians ]]

Other industries include paper, sugar, rubber tires. [[Thaton]] has a major factory (Burmese, Ka-Sa-La) of rubber products run by Ministry of Industry (1). Forests cover approximately half of the area and timber production is one of the major contributors to the economy. Minerals extracted from the area include [[salt]], [[antimony]], and [[granite]]. [[Natural resources]] such as forest products, and onshore and offshore mineral resources, are exploited only by top Myanmar military leaders and foreign companies. At the present time one of the biggest [[foreign direct investment|foreign investments]] into Myanmar is for the exploitation of [[natural gas]] reserves in Mon State. The Yadana Gas project which connected pipelines alongside the towns of Mon state made harassed danger to the native Mon land and [[Mon people]].
[[File:Thom-Malay-Bridge.jpg|thumb|Bridge near Kyaik Maraw, Mon State]]
In Mudon, a small town near [[Mawlamyaing|Mawlamyine]], there is an applied research center for [[agricultural science]] with laboratory bases in rubber plantation and [[fertilization]] of some other species.

The future plans with [[tourism]] will benefit Mon state a lot as it has excellent transportation with the  capital Yangon. Transportation routes include Train, Bus, Sea line and Airlines. The newly opened [[Thanlwin Bridge (Mawlamyine)|Mawlamyine Bridge]] gives quick access from southern [[Ye, Mon State|Ye]] to North [[Bago, Myanmar|Bago]] and Yangon by a day journey. [[Three Pagoda Pass]] is an alternative route which communicates Mon state with neighbour [[Kanchanaburi province]] of Thailand.

According to the Mon State Directorate of Investment and Company, [[foreign direct investment]] from 1994 to 2016 in Mon State was more than US$ 5.433 billion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/china-eyes-mon-state-investment.html|title=China Eyes Mon State Investment|date=10 October 2017|work=The Irrawaddy|access-date=23 October 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>
