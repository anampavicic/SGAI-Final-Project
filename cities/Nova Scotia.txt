It is one of the three [[Maritime Canada|Maritime provinces]].

Nova Scotia is the [[Population of Canada by province and territory|most populous province]] in [[Atlantic Canada]], with an estimated population of over 1 million as of 2024; it is also the second-most densely populated province in Canada, and second-smallest province by area.<ref name="2016census">{{cite web |date=8 February 2017 |title=Census Profile, 2016 Census - Nova Scotia [Province] and Canada [Country] |url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=PR&Code1=12&Geo2=PR&Code2=01&Data=Count&SearchText=nova%20scotia&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&TABID=1 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225002914/https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=PR&Code1=12&Geo2=PR&Code2=01&Data=Count&SearchText=nova%20scotia&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&TABID=1 |archive-date=25 February 2021 |access-date=8 February 2017 |publisher=Statistics Canada}}</ref> The province comprises the [[Nova Scotia peninsula]] and [[Cape Breton Island]], as well as 3,800 other coastal islands.

The land that makes up what is now Nova Scotia was inhabited by the [[Mi'kmaq|Miꞌkmaq]] people at the time of European colonization. In 1605, [[Acadia]]—France's first [[New France]] colony—was founded with the creation of Acadia's capital, [[Port-Royal (Acadia)|Port Royal]]. The Scots, English, then British, fought France for the territory on numerous occasions for over a century afterwards, having gained it from them in the 1713 [[Peace of Utrecht]], which ended the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. In subsequent years, the British began settling "[[foreign Protestants]]" in the region and [[Expulsion of the Acadians|deported the French-speaking Acadians en masse]]. During the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783), thousands of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] settled in Nova Scotia.

In 1848, Nova Scotia became the first British colony to achieve [[responsible government]]. In July 1867, Nova Scotia [[Canadian Confederation|joined in Confederation]] with New Brunswick and the [[Province of Canada]] (now [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]), forming the Dominion of Canada.

==Etymology==
{{Further|Etymology of Scotland}}
"Nova Scotia" is [[Latin]] for "New [[Scotland]]" <ref>[http://www.novascotia.com/en/home/discovernovascotia/history/routestoyourroots/settlementpatterns/scottishsettlement.aspx Scottish Settlement] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207152640/http://www.novascotia.com/en/home/discovernovascotia/history/routestoyourroots/settlementpatterns/scottishsettlement.aspx |date=7 December 2013 }}. Novascotia.com. Retrieved 12 July 2013.</ref> and is the recognized [[Canadian English]] name for the province. In both [[Canadian French]] and [[Canadian Gaelic]], the province is directly translated as "New Scotland" (French: ''{{lang|fr|Nouvelle-Écosse}}''. Canadian Gaelic: ''{{lang|gd|Alba Nuadh}}''). In general, Latin and Slavic languages use a direct translation of "New Scotland", while most other languages use direct transliterations of the Latin/English name.

The province was first named in the 1621 Royal Charter granting to [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling|Sir William Alexander]] the right to settle lands as a [[Scotland|Scottish]] colony, including modern Nova Scotia, [[Cape Breton Island]], [[Prince Edward Island]], [[New Brunswick]] and the [[Gaspé Peninsula]].<ref name="royalcharter">{{cite book |title=Nova Scotia: The Royal Charter of 1621 to Sir William Alexander |url=https://www.fadedpage.com/showbook.php?pid=20110202 |year=1922 |publisher=University of Toronto Press (Reprinted from the Transactions of the Royal Canadian Institute, Vol. XIV, Part 1) |location=Toronto |access-date=7 April 2018 |archive-date=8 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408073335/https://www.fadedpage.com/showbook.php?pid=20110202 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Nova Scotia}}
{{See also|List of provincial parks in Nova Scotia|List of protected areas of Nova Scotia}}
[[File:Novascotia topo.png|thumb|right|Topographic map of Nova Scotia]]

Nova Scotia is Canada's second-smallest province in area, after [[Prince Edward Island]]. It is surrounded by four major bodies of water: the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] to the north, the [[Bay of Fundy]] to the west, the [[Gulf of Maine]] to the southwest, and the Atlantic Ocean to the east.<ref name="ECclimate" /> The province's mainland is the [[Nova Scotia peninsula]] and includes numerous bays and estuaries. Nowhere in Nova Scotia is more than {{cvt|67|km}} from the ocean.<ref>{{cite book |title=O Canada |first=Ted |last=Harrison |publisher=Ticknor & Fields |year=1993 |author-link=Ted Harrison}}</ref> [[Cape Breton Island]], a large island to the northeast of the Nova Scotia mainland, is also part of the province, as is [[Sable Island]], a small island notorious for being the site of offshore shipwrecks,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://maritimemuseum.novascotia.ca/research/sable-island |work=Maritime Museum of the Atlantic |title=Sable Island: Shipwrecks and Lifesaving |date=14 February 2013 |access-date=2 July 2019 |archive-date=7 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211207055001/https://maritimemuseum.novascotia.ca/research/sable-island |url-status=live}}</ref> approximately {{cvt|175|km|-1}} from the province's southern coast.

Nova Scotia has many ancient fossil-bearing rock formations. These formations are particularly rich on the [[Bay of Fundy]]'s shores. Blue Beach near [[Hantsport]], [[Joggins Fossil Cliffs]], on the [[Bay of Fundy]]'s shores, has yielded an abundance of [[Carboniferous]]-age fossils. Wasson's Bluff, near the town of [[Parrsboro]], has yielded both [[Triassic]]- and [[Jurassic]]-age fossils. The highest point is [[White Hill (Nova Scotia)|White Hill]] at 533&nbsp;m (1,749&nbsp;ft) above sea level, situated amongst the [[Cape Breton Highlands]] in the far north of the province.

Nova Scotia is located along the [[45th parallel north]], so it is midway between the [[Equator]] and the [[North Pole]]. The province contains 5,400 lakes.<ref>{{Cite journal |year=2016 |title=Gaspe, Canada |journal=Princess Explorations Café (Powered by the New York Times)}}</ref>

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Nova Scotia}}
[[File:Nova Scotia Köppen.svg|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] of Nova Scotia]]

Nova Scotia lies in the mid-temperate zone and, although the province is almost surrounded by water, the climate is closer to [[continental climate]] rather than [[Oceanic climate|maritime]]. The winter and summer temperature extremes of the continental climate are moderated by the ocean.<ref name=ECclimate>{{cite web |url=http://atlantic-web1.ns.ec.gc.ca/climatecentre/default.asp?lang=En&n=61405176-1 |title=The Climate of Nova Scotia |work=The Climates of Canada |publisher=Environment Canada |access-date=7 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419024000/http://atlantic-web1.ns.ec.gc.ca/climatecentre/default.asp?lang=En&n=61405176-1 |archive-date=19 April 2010}}</ref> However, winters are cold enough to be classified as continental—still being nearer the freezing point than inland areas to the west. The Nova Scotian climate is in many ways similar to the central [[Baltic Sea]] coast in Northern Europe, only wetter and snowier. This is true although Nova Scotia is some fifteen parallels further south. Areas not on the Atlantic coast experience warmer summers more typical of inland areas, and winter lows are a little colder. On 12 August 2020, the community of Grand Étang, famous for its [[Suetes|Les Suêtes]] winds, recorded a balmy overnight low of {{cvt|23.3|C}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?StationID=10792&timeframe=2&StartYear=1840&EndYear=2021&Day=15&Year=2020&Month=8# |title=Daily Data Report for August 2020: Grand Etang, Nova Scotia |date=31 October 2011 |publisher=Government of Canada |access-date=14 July 2021 |url-status=live |archive-date=14 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210814233610/https://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?StationID=10792&timeframe=2&StartYear=1840&EndYear=2021&Day=15&Year=2020&Month=8}}</ref>

===European settlement===
The first Europeans to settle the area were the French, who sailed into the Annapolis Basin in 1604, but chose to settle at [[Saint Croix Island, Maine|Saint Croix Island]] in Maine instead. They abandoned the Maine settlement the following year and, in 1605, established a settlement at [[Port-Royal (Acadia)|Port Royal]], which grew into modern-day [[Annapolis Royal]]. This would be the first permanent European settlement in what would later become Canada. The settlement was in the Mi'kmaw district of Kespukwitk and was the founding settlement of what would become [[Acadia]].<ref name="Morton1999">{{cite book |first=Desmond |last=Morton |title=Canada: A Millennium Portrait |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GOxGQZg0KtoC&pg=PT19 |date=30 November 1999 |publisher=Dundurn |isbn=978-1-4597-1085-6 |page=19 |access-date=31 October 2015 |archive-date=18 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118083129/https://books.google.com/books?id=GOxGQZg0KtoC&pg=PT19 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[http://www.gov.ns.ca/nsarm/virtual/acadian/ Nova Scotia Archives – An Acadian Parish Remembered] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116002459/http://www.gov.ns.ca/nsarm/virtual/acadian/ |date=16 January 2013 }}.

Third Edition. 1998. p. 31</ref>{{request quotation|date=June 2016}} During the first 80 years the French and Acadians lived in Nova Scotia, nine significant military clashes took place as the English, Dutch, French and Mi'kmaq fought for possession of the area.

The [[Acadian Civil War]] took place from 1640 to 1645. Beginning with [[King William's War]] in 1688, a series of six wars [[Second Hundred Years' War|took place between the English and the French]], with Nova Scotia being a consistent theatre of conflict between the two powers.

====18th century====
[[File:EvacutionOfPortRoyal1710byCWJefferys.png|thumb|left|French forces withdrawing from [[Port-Royal (Acadia)|Port-Royal]] after being [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|defeated]] by the British in 1710]]

Hostilities between England and France in North America resumed from 1702 to 1713, known as [[Queen Anne's War]]. The [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|siege of Port Royal]] took place in 1710, ending French rule in peninsular Acadia. The subsequent signing of the [[Peace of Utrecht|Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713 formally recognized British rule in the region, while returning Cape Breton Island (''{{lang|fr|Île Royale}}'') and Prince Edward Island (''{{lang|fr|Île Saint-Jean}}'') to the French. Despite the British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|conquest of Acadia]] in 1710, Nova Scotia remained primarily occupied by Catholic Acadians and Mi'kmaq, who confined British forces to Annapolis and to Canso. Present-day New Brunswick formed a part of the French colony of Acadia. Immediately after the capture of Port Royal in 1710, [[Francis Nicholson]] announced it would be renamed [[Annapolis Royal]] in honour of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].

As a result of [[Dummer's War|Father Rale's War]] (1722–1725), the Mi'kmaq signed a series of treaties with the British in 1725. The Mi'kmaq signed a treaty of submission to the British crown.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mascarene's Treaty of 1725 |url=http://www.stmarysfirstnation.com/consult/Treaty1.pdf |access-date=15 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010214841/http://www.stmarysfirstnation.com/consult/Treaty1.pdf |archive-date=10 October 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mascarene 'sTreaty of 1725 |url=https://www.apcfnc.ca/images/uploads/mascarenestreaty.pdf |access-date=20 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719200134/https://www.apcfnc.ca/images/uploads/mascarenestreaty.pdf |archive-date=19 July 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref> However, conflict between the Acadians, Mi'kmaq, French and the British persisted in the following decades with [[King George's War]] (1744–1748).

[[Father Le Loutre's War]] (1749–1755) began when [[Edward Cornwallis]] arrived to establish [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] with 13 transports on 21 June 1749.<ref>Grenier, John.

During the [[French and Indian War]] of 1754–1763 (the North American theatre of the [[Seven Years' War]]), the British [[Expulsion of the Acadians|deported the Acadians]] and recruited [[New England Planters]] to resettle the colony. The 75-year period of war ended with the [[Peace and Friendship Treaties|Halifax Treaties]] between the British and the Mi'kmaq (1761). After the war, some Acadians were allowed to return.

[[File:Deportation Grand-Pré.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Expulsion of the Acadians]] in [[Grand-Pré, Nova Scotia|Grand-Pré]]. More than 80 per cent of the Acadian population was expelled from the region between 1755 and 1764.]]

In 1763, most of Acadia (Cape Breton Island, St. John's Island (now Prince Edward Island), and New Brunswick) became part of Nova Scotia. In 1765, the county of [[Sunbury County, Nova Scotia|Sunbury]] was created. This included the territory of present-day New Brunswick and eastern Maine as far as the [[Penobscot River]]. In 1769, St. John's Island became a separate colony.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Prince Edward Island {{!}} History, Population, & Facts |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Prince-Edward-Island |access-date=5 February 2022 |website=Britannica |language=en |archive-date=22 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211222154921/https://www.britannica.com/place/Prince-Edward-Island |url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[American Revolution]] (1775–1783) had a significant impact on shaping Nova Scotia, with the colony initially displaying ambivalence over whether the colony should join the revolution; Rebellion flared at the [[Battle of Fort Cumberland (1776)]] and at the [[St. John River expedition|Siege of Saint John (1777)]]. Throughout the war, American [[privateer]]s devastated the maritime economy by capturing ships and looting almost every community outside of Halifax. These American raids alienated many sympathetic or neutral Nova Scotians into supporting the British. By the end of the war, Nova Scotia had outfitted numerous privateers to attack American shipping.<ref>Roger Marsters (2004). ''Bold Privateers: Terror, Plunder and Profit on Canada's Atlantic Coast'', pp. 87–89.</ref>

British military forces based at Halifax succeeded in preventing an American occupation of Nova Scotia, though the [[Royal Navy]] failed to establish naval supremacy in the region. While the British captured many American privateers in battles such as the [[Battle off Halifax (1782)|Naval battle off Halifax]] (1782), many more continued attacks on shipping and settlements until the final months of the war. The Royal Navy struggled to maintain British supply lines, defending British convoys from American and French attacks as in the fiercely fought convoy battle, the [[Action of 21 July 1781|Naval battle off Cape Breton]] (1781).

[[File:AricanNovaScotianByCaptain William Booth1788.png|thumb|left|A [[Black Loyalist]] wood cutter, at [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia]], in 1788]]

After the Americans and their French allies won at the [[siege of Yorktown]] in 1781, approximately 33,000 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] (the King's Loyal Americans, allowed to place "[[United Empire Loyalist]]" after their names) settled in Nova Scotia (14,000 of them in what became New Brunswick) on lands granted by the Crown as some compensation for their losses. (The British administration divided Nova Scotia and hived off Cape Breton and New Brunswick in 1784). The Loyalist exodus created new communities across Nova Scotia, including [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]], which briefly became one of the larger British settlements in North America, and infused Nova Scotia with additional capital and skills.

The migration caused political tensions between Loyalist leaders and the leaders of the existing New England Planters settlement. The Loyalist influx also pushed Nova Scotia's 2000 Mi'kmaq People to the margins as Loyalist land grants encroached on ill-defined native lands. As part of the Loyalist migration, about 3,000 [[Black Loyalist]]s arrived; they founded the largest free Black settlement in North America at [[Birchtown, Nova Scotia|Birchtown]], near Shelburne. There are several Black Loyalists buried in unmarked graves in the [[Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia)|Old Burying Ground]] in Halifax. Many Nova Scotian communities were [[Nova Scotia in the American Revolution#Loyalist settlements|settled by British regiments that fought in the war]].

During the [[War of 1812]], Nova Scotia's contribution to the British war effort involved communities either purchasing or building various privateer ships to attack U.S. vessels.<ref>{{cite book |last=Boileau |first=John |title=Half-Hearted Enemies: Nova Scotia, New England and the War of 1812 |location=Halifax |publisher=Formac Publishing |year=2005 |page=53 |isbn=9780887806575}}</ref> Perhaps the most dramatic moment in the war for Nova Scotia occurred when [[HMS Shannon (1806)|HMS ''Shannon'']] escorted the captured American frigate [[USS Chesapeake (1799)|USS ''Chesapeake'']] into [[Halifax Harbour]] in 1813.

Nova Scotia became the first colony in [[British North America]] and in the [[British Empire]] to achieve [[responsible government]] in January–February 1848 and become [[self-governing colony|self-governing]] through the efforts of [[Joseph Howe]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Joseph Howe: The Briton Becomes Canadian, 1848–1873 |last=Beck |first=James Murray |year=1982 |volume=2 |location=Kingston & Montreal |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |isbn=0-7735-0388-9}}</ref> Nova Scotia had established [[Representative democracy|representative government]] in 1758, an achievement later commemorated by the erection of [[Sir Sandford Fleming Park|Dingle Tower]] in 1908.

===Post-Confederation history===
[[File:Bluenose sailing 1921.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Bluenose]]'' in 1921. The racing ship became a provincial icon for Nova Scotia in the 1920s and 1930s.]]

Soon after the American Civil War, Pro-Canadian Confederation [[List of premiers of Nova Scotia|premier]] [[Charles Tupper]] led Nova Scotia into [[Canadian Confederation]] on 1 July 1867, along with New Brunswick and the [[Province of Canada]]. The [[Anti-Confederation Party]] was led by [[Joseph Howe]]. Almost three months later, in the election of 18 September 1867, the Anti-Confederation Party won 18 out of 19 federal seats, and 36 out of 38 seats in the provincial legislature.

Throughout the 19th century, numerous businesses developed in Nova Scotia became of pan-Canadian and international importance: the Starr Manufacturing Company (first ice skate manufacturer in Canada), the [[Scotiabank|Bank of Nova Scotia]], [[Cunard Line]], Alexander Keith's Brewery, Morse's Tea Company (first tea company in Canada), among others.

Nova Scotia became a world leader in both building and owning wooden sailing ships in the second half of the 19th century. Nova Scotia produced internationally recognized shipbuilders [[Donald McKay]] and [[William Dawson Lawrence]]. The fame Nova Scotia achieved from sailors was assured in 1895 when [[Joshua Slocum]] became the first man to sail single-handedly around the world. International attention continued into the following century with the many racing victories of the ''[[Bluenose]]'' schooner. Nova Scotia was also the birthplace and home of [[Samuel Cunard]], a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] shipping magnate (born at [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]], Nova Scotia) who founded the Cunard Line.

In December 1917, about 2,000 people were killed in the [[Halifax Explosion]].

In April 2004, the Nova Scotia legislature adopted a resolution explicitly inviting the government of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] to explore the possibility of joining [[Canada]] as part of that [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Province]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=22 April 2004 |title=N.S. votes to invite Turks and Caicos to join it |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/n-s-votes-to-invite-turks-and-caicos-to-join-it-1.465836 |website=CBC News |access-date=21 February 2024 |archive-date=24 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240224003525/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/n-s-votes-to-invite-turks-and-caicos-to-join-it-1.465836 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Nova Scotia's traditionally [[Natural resource|resource-based economy]] has diversified in recent{{when|date=August 2022}} decades. The rise of Nova Scotia as a viable jurisdiction in North America, historically, was driven by the ready availability of natural resources, especially the [[Fish stocks|fish stock]]s off the [[Scotian Shelf]]. The [[Fishing|fishery]] was a pillar of the economy since its development as part of [[New France]] in the 17th century; however, the fishery suffered a sharp decline due to [[overfishing]] in the late 20th century. The collapse of the [[Atlantic Cod|cod stocks]] and the closure of this sector resulted in a loss of approximately 20,000 jobs in 1992.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fisherycrisis.com |title=The Starving Ocean |author=Fish in Crisis |access-date=26 April 2007 |archive-date=28 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210928053844/http://www.fisherycrisis.com/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

Other sectors in the province were also hit hard, particularly during the last two{{when|reason=which two?|date=August 2022}} decades: coal mining in Cape Breton and northern mainland Nova Scotia has virtually ceased, and a [[Sydney Steel Corporation|large steel]] mill in [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]] closed during the 1990s. More recently, the high value of the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar has hurt the forestry industry, leading to the shutdown of a long-running [[Bowater Mersey Paper Company Limited|pulp and paper mill]] near [[Liverpool, Nova Scotia|Liverpool]].

Nova Scotia is divided into [[List of counties of Nova Scotia|18 counties]]. 9 of the original 18 counties retain a county-level government while the rest are either governed by [[List of municipalities in Nova Scotia|regional or district municipalities]]. Regional municipalities are coextensive with the borders with a historic county, while historic counties governed by district municipalities are split into two district municipalities each.

Nova Scotia has more than 450 public schools for children. The public system offers primary to Grade 12. There are also private schools in the province. Public education is administered by seven regional school boards, responsible primarily for English instruction and French immersion, and also province-wide by the [[Conseil Scolaire Acadien Provincial]], which administers French instruction to students whose primary language is French.<ref>{{Citation |last=Conseil scolaire acadien provincial |title=Notre mission et notre vision, Our Mission and vision statement |website=Le CSAP |url=https://csap.ca/le-csap/notre-mission-et-notre-vision |access-date=22 October 2022 |archive-date=22 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221022164334/https://csap.ca/le-csap/notre-mission-et-notre-vision |url-status=live}}</ref>
