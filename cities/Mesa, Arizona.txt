'''Mesa''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|eɪ|s|ə}} {{respell|MAY|sə}}) is a city in [[Maricopa County, Arizona]], United States. It is the [[List of municipalities in Arizona|third-most populous city]] in Arizona, after [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], the [[List of United States cities by population|36th-most populous city]] in the U.S., and the most populous city that is not a county seat (except for independent cities [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Baltimore]] which are not part of any county). The city is home to 504,258 people as of 2020.<ref name="QuickFacts">{{cite web |title=QuickFacts: Mesa city, Arizona |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/mesacityarizona/POP010220 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |access-date=August 26, 2021}}</ref> It is the most populous city in the [[East Valley (Phoenix metropolitan area)|East Valley]] of the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-07/how-to-define-american-suburbs|title=How to Tell If You Live in the Suburbs|website=[[Bloomberg News]]| date=July 7, 2020 }}</ref> It is bordered by [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]] on the west, the [[Salt River Pima–Maricopa Indian Community]] on the north, [[Chandler, Arizona|Chandler]] and [[Gilbert, Arizona|Gilbert]] on the south along with [[Queen Creek, Arizona|Queen Creek]], and [[Apache Junction]] on the east.

At least ten colleges and universities are located in Mesa, as is the [[Mesa Arizona Temple]], one of the first LDS temples constructed outside of Utah. The city is home to the largest [[relief airport]] in the Phoenix area, [[Phoenix–Mesa Gateway Airport]], located in the southeastern corner of the city. In separate studies in 2014 and 2017, researchers determined Mesa to be "America's most [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] city".<ref name="MIT">{{Cite web|last=Epstein|first=Ethan|title=Are Conservative Cities Better?|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/09/mesa-arizona-are-conservative-cities-better-111069|access-date=September 25, 2021|website=Politico Magazine|date=September 17, 2014 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="Pew">{{cite web |title=Mesa ranked most conservative large city in the U.S. by Pew |url=https://www.eastvalleytribune.com/local/mesa/mesa-ranked-most-conservative-large-city-in-the-u-s/article_f4e62f46-6e75-11e7-a04e-e7efc8a6732c.html |website=East Valley Tribune |access-date=November 21, 2023 |language=en |date=July 24, 2017}}</ref>

==History==
{{For timeline}}
The history of Mesa dates back at least 2,000 years to the arrival of the [[Hohokam]] people. The Hohokam, whose name means "All Used Up" or "The Departed Ones", built the original canal system. The canals were the largest and most sophisticated in the prehistoric New World. Some were up to {{convert|90|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|10|ft}} deep at their head gates, extending for as far as {{convert|16|mi|km}} across the desert. By AD 1100, water could be delivered to an area over {{convert|110000|acre|km2}}, transforming the Sonoran Desert into an agricultural oasis. By 1450, the Hohokam had constructed hundreds of miles of canals, many of which are still in use.<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.mesalibrary.org/about_mesa/mesahistory/hohokam.aspx |title= A Brief History of Mesa, Arizona: Hohokam |date=July 2003 |work= Mesalibrary.org |publisher= City of Mesa Library |access-date= March 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307003136/http://www.mesalibrary.org/about_mesa/mesahistory/hohokam.aspx|archive-date=March 7, 2012}}</ref>

After the disappearance of the Hohokam and before the arrival of the early settlers, little is known; explorers did not venture into this area. By the late 19th century near present-day Mesa, [[U.S. Army]] troops relocated the [[Apache]], opening the way for settlement.<ref>{{citation |last=Bourke|first=John|url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/apache.htm|title=Battle with the Apache, 1872}}</ref>

In March 1877, [[Mormon pioneer]] [[Daniel Webster Jones (Mormon)|Daniel Webster Jones]] and Henry Clay Rogers left [[St. George, Utah|St. George]], Utah. Jones had been asked by Mormon officials to direct a party of people in establishing a settlement in Arizona. They traveled south and settled on the north side of the present Mesa area. This settlement was initially known as Fort Utah and later as Jonesville. It was located near Lehi Road. In 1883, it was named [[Lehi, Arizona|Lehi]] at the suggestion of [[Brigham Young, Jr.]]<ref>{{citation |last= Jenson |first= Andrew |author-link= Andrew Jenson |title= Encyclopedic History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |location= Salt Lake City |publisher= [[Deseret News|Deseret News Publishing Company]] |year= 1941 |page= 426 |url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/BYUIBooks/id/2694/show/2249 }}</ref>

About this same time, another group dubbed the First Mesa Company arrived from Utah and Idaho. Their leaders were Francis Martin Pomeroy, [[Charles Crismon]], George Warren Sirrine and Charles I. Robson. Rather than accepting an invitation to settle at Jones's Lehi settlement, they moved up onto the [[mesa]] that serves as the city's namesake. They dug irrigation canals and used some of the original Hohokam canals. By April 1878, water was flowing through them.<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.mesalibrary.org/about_mesa/mesahistory/firstmesa.aspx |title= A Brief History of Mesa, Arizona: First Mesa Company |date=July 2003 |work= Mesalibrary.org |publisher= City of Mesa Library |access-date= March 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007033038/http://www.mesalibrary.org/about_mesa/mesahistory/firstmesa.aspx|archive-date=October 7, 2011 }}</ref> The Second Mesa Company arrived in 1879 and settled to the west of the First Mesa Company because of more available farmland. This settlement was originally called Alma and later Stringtown. It was located near where Alma School Road.<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.mesalibrary.org/about_mesa/mesahistory/secondmesa.aspx |title= A Brief History of Mesa, Arizona: Second Mesa Company |date=July 2003 |work= Mesalibrary.org |publisher= City of Mesa Library |access-date= March 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007033144/http://www.mesalibrary.org/about_mesa/mesahistory/secondmesa.aspx|archive-date=October 7, 2011 }}</ref>

On July 17, 1878, Mesa City was registered as a {{convert|1|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} townsite. The first school was built in 1879. In 1883, Mesa City was [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] with a population of 300 people. Dr. A. J. Chandler, who would later go on to found the [[Chandler, Arizona|city of Chandler]], worked on widening the Mesa Canal in 1895 to allow for enough flow to build a power plant. In 1917, the city of Mesa purchased this utility company. The revenues from the company provided enough for capital expenditures until the 1960s. During the [[Great Depression]], [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] funds provided paved streets, a new hospital, a new town hall and a library.<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.mesalibrary.org/about_mesa/mesahistory/mesacity.aspx |title= A Brief History of Mesa, Arizona: Mesa City – 1878 to Depression |date=July 2003 |work= Mesalibrary.org |publisher= City of Mesa Library |access-date= March 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307003141/http://www.mesalibrary.org/about_mesa/mesahistory/mesacity.aspx|archive-date=March 7, 2012 }}</ref>

After the founding of the city, the elected official that most impacted the municipality was [[George Nicholas Goodman]]. He was mayor five different times<ref name=news>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23142973/nice_article_photo_of_george_n/ |title=Nice article & photo of George N. Goodman, mayor 1952 June 10 AZ Republic|newspaper=Arizona Republic|date=June 10, 1952|pages=11|via=newspapers.com}}</ref> during three different decades (1938–1942, 1946–1948, 1952–1956) (see: [[List of mayors of Mesa, Arizona]]). As mayor, he was directly involved in the process of acquiring land for both [[Falcon Field (Arizona)|Falcon Field]] and [[Williams Air Force Base|Williams Field]].<ref name=news/>

With the opening of [[Falcon Field (Arizona)|Falcon Field]] and [[Williams Air Force Base|Williams Field]] in the early 1940s, more military personnel began to move into the Mesa area. With the advent of [[air conditioning]] and the rise of tourism, population growth exploded in Mesa as well as the rest of the Phoenix area. Industry—especially early aerospace companies—grew in the 1950s and 1960s. As late as 1960, half of the residents of Mesa made a living with agriculture, but that number declined substantially as Mesa's suburban growth continued on track with the rest of the Phoenix metro area.<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.mesalibrary.org/about_mesa/mesahistory/wwii.aspx |title= A Brief History of Mesa, Arizona: World War II to Present |date=July 2003 |work= Mesalibrary.org |publisher= City of Mesa Library |access-date= March 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307003144/http://www.mesalibrary.org/about_mesa/mesahistory/wwii.aspx|archive-date=March 7, 2012 }}</ref>

==Geography==

===Defining east and west Mesa===
Mesa stretches {{convert|18|mi|km}} from Price Road in the west to Meridian Road in the east and has a land area of {{convert|138.70|sqmi|km2}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=QuickFacts Mesa city, Arizona; United States |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/mesacityarizona,US/ |website=census.gov |access-date=19 August 2024}}</ref> Mesa employs a grid system for street numbering that is different from that used in Phoenix and other portions of the metropolitan area. Center Street, running north to south, bisects Mesa into eastern and western halves and serves as the east and west numbering point of origin within Mesa.<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.mesaaz.gov/maps/pdf/zip_code_map.pdf |title= Mesa ZIP codes |work= mesaaz.gov |publisher= City of Mesa |date= October 15, 2009 |access-date= March 13, 2012 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120227155608/http://www.mesaaz.gov/maps/pdf/zip_code_map.pdf |archive-date= February 27, 2012 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> Streets west of Center St., such as W. University Drive or W. Main St. are considered to be in West Mesa, whereas streets east of Center St., such as E. University or E. Main St., are considered to be in East Mesa.

===Climate===
Located in the [[Sonoran Desert]], Mesa has a hot [[desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''BWh''), with mild winters and very hot summers.
