'''Meknes''' ({{langx|ar|مكناس|maknās}}, {{IPA|ar|maknaːs|pron}}) is one of the four [[Imperial cities of Morocco]], located in northern central [[Morocco]] and the sixth largest city by population in the kingdom. Founded in the 11th century by the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]] as a military settlement, Meknes became the capital of [[Morocco]] during the reign of Sultan [[Ismail Ibn Sharif]] (1672–1727), son of the founder of the [[Alaouite dynasty]]. Sultan Ismail created a massive [[Kasbah of Moulay Ismail|imperial palace complex]] and endowed the city with extensive fortifications and monumental gates.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|title=Historic City of Meknes|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/793/|access-date=2020-08-04|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|language=en}}</ref> The city recorded a population of 632,079 in the [[2014 Moroccan census]].<ref name=citydefn/> It is the seat of [[Meknès Prefecture]] and an important economic hub in the region of [[Fès-Meknès]].

==Etymology==
Meknes is named after an [[Amazigh]] (Berber) tribe historically known as the [[Miknasa]] ({{Lang|ber|Imeknasen}} in [[Amazigh languages]]).<ref name=":6" />

===Early history (8th–16th centuries)===
[[Volubilis]], a major [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]-era settlement in Morocco and one of its early urban centres, is located near the site of the current city of Meknes. The current city and its name, however, originate with a [[Berber people|Berber]] tribe called the [[Miknasa]] who settled this region around the 10th century.<ref name=":1" /> A group of small unfortified Miknasa villages known as ''miknāsat al-zaytūn'' were established here in the 10th century.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&dq=grove+encyclopedia+meknes+miknasa&pg=RA1-PA475 |title=The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |isbn=9780195309911 |editor-last=Bloom |editor-first=Jonathan M. |pages=475–476 |chapter=Meknès |doi=10.1093/gao/9781884446054.article.T001442 |editor-last2=Blair |editor-first2=Sheila S.}}</ref> The [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]] founded a fortress or fortified settlement just south of these villages after conquering the area in the 11th century.<ref name=":4" /> Originally called Tagrart or Taqrart, this Almoravid settlement formed the beginnings of what is now the old medina of Meknes.<ref name=":17" />{{Rp|176}} The [[Nejjarine Mosque]], often reputed to be the oldest mosque in the city, dates back to the Almoravid period and may have served as the central mosque of the Almoravid settlement.<ref name=":17" />{{Rp|177, 212–213}} The mosque that became the present-day [[Grand Mosque of Meknes]] is believed to have been first built by the Almoravids in the 12th century.<ref name=":03">{{Cite book|last1=Métalsi|first1=Mohamed|title=Les villes impériales du Maroc|last2=Tréal|first2=Cécile|last3=Ruiz|first3=Jean-Michel|publisher=Terrail|year=1999|location=Paris}}</ref><ref name=":14">{{Cite book|last1=Ramirez|first1=Francis|title=Meknès, cité impériale|last2=Rolot|first2=Christian|publisher=ACR Édition|year=2004|location=Courbevoie (France)|pages=134}}</ref>

The latter included the [[Bou Inania Madrasa (Meknes)|Bou Inania Madrasa]] (built in 1336) and two other madrasas, ''Madrasa al-Qadi'' and ''Madrasa Shuhud'', all built by Sultan [[Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Othman|Abu el-Hassan]].<ref name=":123" />

After the end of the Marinid and [[Wattasid dynasty|Wattasid]] periods, however, Meknes suffered from neglect as the new [[Saadi dynasty|Saadian]] dynasty (16th and early 17th century) focused their attention on their capital at [[Marrakesh]] and neglected the old northern cities of Morocco.<ref name=":22" />

===The reign of Moulay Isma'il (17th–18th centuries)===
[[File:Mausoleum of moulay ismail DSCF5915.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Mausoleum of Moulay Ismail|Mausoleum]] of [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Moulay Isma'il]]]]
It wasn't until the [[Alaouite dynasty|Alaouite]] dynasty in the second half of the 17th century that Meknes received renewed attention. Under [[Al-Rashid of Morocco|Moulay Rashid]] (ruled 1666–1672), the first Alaouite sultan to unite Morocco under his rule, Fes became the capital once more and his brother, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Moulay Isma'il ibn Sharif]], governed Meknes.<ref name=":22" /><ref name=":222">{{Cite book|last=Deverdun|first=Gaston|title=Marrakech: Des origines à 1912|publisher=Éditions Techniques Nord-Africaines|year=1959|location=Rabat}}</ref> Upon Rashid's death in 1672, Moulay Isma'il became sultan and chose Meknes as his new capital. In addition to his possible attachment to the city as a governor, a number of reasons may have favoured this choice.<ref name=":22" />{{Rp|129}} One may have been the fact that Ismail had to fight hard to reconquer both Fes and [[Marrakesh]] from his rival nephew (Ahmad al-Mahriz, son of Moulay Rashid) during the first years of his reign, which may have rendered him skeptical towards both cities as possible centers of power.<ref name=":22" /><ref name=":222" />{{Rp|467–468}} Moreover, Moulay Rashid had garrisoned much of Fes with his own contingents from the [[Tafilalt]] and eastern Morocco while Moulay Isma'il was forming his own personal royal guard composed of [[Black people|Black]] slaves (''<nowiki/>'abid'') from [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and there may have been concerns that not all these contingents could be garrisoned simultaneously in Fes. The ''[[Ulama|ulema]]'' (religious scholars) of Fes were also particularly disapproving of his ways, including his use of slaves (many of whom were of Muslim background), and maintained tense relations with him throughout his reign.<ref name=":15">{{Cite book|last=Abun-Nasr|first=Jamil|title=A history of the Maghrib in the Islamic period|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|isbn=0521337674|location=Cambridge}}</ref><ref name=":22" /><ref name=":3">{{Cite book|last=Arnold|first=Felix|title=Islamic Palace Architecture in the Western Mediterranean: A History|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|pages=309–312}}</ref> Choosing Meknes thus removed him from the influence of traditional elites and allowed him to build a fresh base from which he hoped to exercise absolute power.<ref name=":15" /> The threat of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] attacks from the east (from [[Algeria]]) and the increasing insecurity in central Morocco due to tribal migrations from the [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas]] and [[Sahara]] regions may have also persuaded Ismail that Meknes, situated further west, was more defensible than Fes.<ref name=":15" />{{Rp|234}}<ref name=":22" />{{Rp|129, 138}}

Whatever the reasons, Ismail made Meknes the center of Morocco in his time and he embarked on the construction of a new [[Kasbah of Moulay Ismail|monumental palace-city]] on the south side of the old city. Its construction continued throughout the 55 years of his reign, beginning immediately after his accession to the throne in 1672.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":123" /><ref name="Daaïf 2013 243–266">{{Cite journal|last=Daaïf|first=Lahcen|date=2013|title=Les inscriptions de Bab Mansur al-'Ilğ: déchiffrement et traduction|journal=Al-Qantara|volume=34|issue=2|pages=243–266|doi=10.3989/alqantara.2013.009|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=":132">{{Cite web|last=Mezzine|first=Mohamed|title=Palace of Mulay Isma'il|url=http://islamicart.museumwnf.org/database_item.php?id=monument;ISL;ma;Mon01;16;en|website=Discover Islamic Art, Museum With No Frontiers}}</ref> Existing structures dating from the earlier medieval kasbah of the city were demolished to make way; the name of the large public square in front of the Kasbah today, ''el-Hedim'' (or Place el-Hedim), means "the rubble" and came from the masses of rubble and debris which were piled here during the demolition.<ref name=":52">{{Citation|last=Barrucand|first=Marianne|title=Les relations entre ville et ensemble palatial dans les " villes impériales " marocaines : Marrakech et Meknès|date=2019-11-18|url=http://books.openedition.org/pul/19372|work=Les Palais dans la ville : Espaces urbains et lieux de la puissance publique dans la Méditerranée médiévale|pages=325–341|editor-last=Boucheron|editor-first=Patrick|series=Collection d’histoire et d’archéologie médiévales|publisher=Presses universitaires de Lyon|isbn=978-2-7297-1086-6|access-date=2020-06-07|editor2-last=Chiffoleau|editor2-first=Jacques}}</ref><ref name=":23"/><ref name=":123" /> Labour was carried out by paid workers as well as by contingents of slaves, particularly [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]].<ref name=":123" /> Estimates on the total number of workers involved range from 25,000 and 55,000.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":123" /> Nonetheless, frequently-told stories about the tens of thousands of Christian slaves used for labour and the large underground dungeons where they were kept are somewhat exaggerated and originate from the accounts of European ambassadors who visited Isma'il's court (often to negotiate the release of prisoners from their countries).<ref name=":125">{{Cite book|last=Parker|first=Richard|title=A practical guide to Islamic Monuments in Morocco|publisher=The Baraka Press|year=1981|location=Charlottesville, VA}}</ref> In reality, the number of Christian slaves was likely closer to a few thousand at most and the chambers popularly called "prisons" were actually storage rooms for grain and supplies.<ref name=":125"/>{{Rp|106}}<ref name=":4" />{{Rp|267}}

It was also in Moulay Ismail's reign that the Jewish inhabitants of the city were moved to a new ''[[Mellah]]'' or Jewish district to the west, near the Kasbah, not unlike the [[Mellah of Fez|Mellah of Fes]] or that of Marrakesh.<ref name=":15" />{{Rp|234}} The Mellah was located between the old medina, west of Place el-Hedim, and the more outlying quarter of Madinat al-Riyad al-Anbari. Both the Mellah and Madinat ar-Riyad were part of an urban extension ordered by Isma'il in the western angle between the old city and the Kasbah.<ref name=":172" />{{Rp|54}} Moulay Isma'il also undertook works throughout the old city too. He refortified the walls and built new monumental city gates such as Bab Berda'in and [[Bab el-Khemis (Meknes)|Bab Khemis]].<ref name=":022">{{Cite book|last=Marçais|first=Georges|title=L'architecture musulmane d'Occident|publisher=Arts et métiers graphiques|year=1954|location=Paris}}</ref><ref name=":22" /> He also built several other [[kasbah]]s or garrison forts throughout the city to house his ''<nowiki/>'abid'' troops and help protect (and control) the rest of the town, such as the Kasbah Hadrash and the Kasbah Tizimi.<ref name=":22" />{{Rp|142}} He carried out renovations to the Grand Mosque and the nearby Madrasa al-Qadi (which he devotes to students from the [[Tafilalt]]),<ref name=":03" /><ref name=":123" /> and founded the Zitouna Mosque.<ref name=":22" /> [[Khnata bent Bakkar]], one of his wives who was [[vizier]] (minister) under him (and briefly became ''[[de facto]]'' ruler of Morocco in 1728 after his death), was responsible for founding the [[Bab Berdieyinne Mosque|Bab Berda'in Mosque]], completed in 1709.<ref name=":8">{{Cite book|last=Glacier|first=Osire|title=Femmes politiques au Maroc d'hier à aujourd'hui: La résistance et le pouvoir au féminin|publisher=Tarik Éditions|year=2016}}</ref><ref name=":9">{{Cite web|last=Bentaleb|first=Hassan|title=Trois mois après le drame de la mosquée Khnata Bent Bakkar à Meknès : Retour chez les miraculés|url=https://www.libe.ma/Trois-mois-apres-le-drame-de-la-mosquee-Khnata-Bent-Bakkar-a-Meknes-Retour-chez-les-miracules_a11637.html|access-date=2020-04-22|website=Libération|language=fr}}</ref><ref name=":10">{{Cite web|title=Meknes, the city of endless heritage {{!}} Saad Guerraoui|url=https://thearabweekly.com/meknes-city-endless-heritage|access-date=2020-04-22|website=AW|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":17">{{Cite book |last=El Khammar |first=Abdeltif |url=http://theses.univ-lyon2.fr/documents/lyon2/2005/el-khammar_a#p=0&a=top |title=Mosquées et oratoires de Meknès (IXe-XVIIIe siècle): géographie religieuse, architecture et problème de la Qibla |publisher=Université Lumière-Lyon 2 |year=2005 |language=fr |type=PhD thesis}}</ref>[[File:TROTTER(1881) p315 GATEWAY IN MEQUINEZ.jpg|thumb|View of Bab Berda'in gate and the minaret of the [[Bab Berdieyinne Mosque|Bab Barda'in Mosque]] (photograph from 1881)]]One of the last constructions before his death, carried out between 1721 and 1725, was the Heri al-Mansur, a palace on the far southern edge of the kasbah which included vast stables.<ref name=":3" /> The monumental gate known as Bab al-Mansur al-'Alj, overlooking Place al-Hedim, was only finished in 1732 by his son [[Abdallah of Morocco|Moulay Abdallah]].<ref name=":7" /> His son and brief successor, [[Abu'l Abbas Ahmad of Morocco|Moulay Ahmad ad-Dhahabi]], carried out modifications to his [[Mausoleum of Moulay Ismail|father's mausoleum]] during his two brief reigns (in 1727–28 and 1728–29) and was himself buried here in 1729.<ref name=":123" />

===Later Alaouite period (18th–20th centuries)===
Following Moulay Isma'il's death, however, the political situation in Morocco degenerated into relative anarchy as his sons competed for power. Meknes lost its status as capital and suffered damage in the [[1755 Meknes earthquake|1755 earthquake]].<ref name=":3" /> The city was neglected and many parts of the enormous imperial kasbah fell into disrepair. The site received only occasional royal attention in the following centuries. Sultan [[Mohammed ben Abdallah|Muhammad ibn Abdallah]], who ruled between 1757 and 1790, built a number of projects in the city. He added the Dar al-Bayda Palace in the Agdal garden to the southeast of the main palace complex, which was later turned into a [[Meknes Royal Military Academy|royal military academy]].<ref name=":3" /> He constructed the [[Er-Roua Mosque]] in the southern part of Moulay Isma'il's Kasbah, which became the largest mosque in Meknes.<ref name="Maslow 19372">{{Cite book|last=Maslow|first=Boris|title=Les mosquées de Fès et du nord du Maroc|publisher=Éditions d'art et d'histoire|year=1937|location=Paris}}</ref><ref name=":022"/>{{Rp|391}} He also renovated and added a ''[[qubba]]'' over the tomb of Sidi Mohammed ben Aissa (just outside the city walls) and built the current minarets of the Grand Mosque and the Nejjarine Mosque in the old city.<ref name=":03" /><ref name=":22" /> The Dar al-Kebira, however, was abandoned and progressively transformed into a residential neighbourhood where the inhabitants constructed their houses within and between the former palace structures of Isma'il's time.<ref name=":125"/> In the early 19th century, Sultan [[Abd al-Rahman of Morocco|Moulay Abd ar-Rahman]] added a loggia structure in front of Bab al-Mansur which served as a meeting place for ceremonies and the governor's tribunal, though this structure was later removed.<ref name=":123" />

===Recent history (20th–21st centuries)===
[[File:Meknes 49DSC 0239 (40754287960).jpg|left|thumb|A main street in the ''Ville Nouvelle'' (new city)]]
[[File:Meknes CityHall.jpg|thumb|City Hall of Meknes, built between 1934 and 1950 on a 1933 design by architect Gaston Goupil]]
After the installation of [[French Protectorate in Morocco|French colonial rule]] in Morocco in 1912, the French administration created a new city (''[[Planned community|Ville Nouvelle]]'') on a nearby plateau across the valley on the northeast side of the old city. The capital of Morocco was moved from Fes to [[Rabat]], further marginalizing cities like Meknes (which is near Fes). Some traditional Muslim authorities and officials were retained, but Meknes was reorganized under a new French municipal and military regime.<ref name=":22" /> This also led to a greater influence of the cities over their surrounding countryside and growing urbanization. The city became a transportation hub for people and goods traveling from east to west or from north to south across the country, in addition to hosting extensive military barracks. The population of Meknes grew from 25,000 at the beginning of the century to over 140,000 by the mid-20th century.<ref name=":22" />{{Rp|191–192}} Some roads in the old city were widened to accommodate greater circulation, but most of the new development took place in the ''Ville Nouvelle''. The new French authorities took interest in the conservation of historic monuments in the old city; the madrasas, for example, were restored in 1922.<ref name=":22" />{{Rp|199}} During this period Meknes also became a center of agriculture and [[Viticulture|viniculture]], led mainly by French colonists who appropriated large amounts of land nearby.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":22" />

Nonetheless, Meknes, like other cities, also hosted resistance to French authority. In 1937, a particularly serious and violent revolt erupted following attempts to divert the local river to benefit the French settler population during a time of food shortages for the native Moroccan population. A violent suppression of protests took place in the city which results in 13 dead and more injured.<ref name=":22" /><ref name=":18">{{Cite book|last=Abun-Nasr|first=Jamil|title=A history of the Maghrib in the Islamic period|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|isbn=0521337674|location=Cambridge|pages=387–89}}</ref><ref name=":05">{{Cite book|last=Hoisington|first=William A.

Large scale rural migration increased the population of the city and intensified the urbanization process (as elsewhere in the country). Industries developed around the city's perimeter, but at the same time the old elites and [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] families moved away to the coastal cities like [[Casablanca]] and Rabat.<ref name=":22" />

These changes also contributed to the relative neglect of the old city. According to the [[ICOMOS]] Heritage at Risk report of 2000, the historic city of Meknes contains insufficient drainage systems, and as a result, suffers from inundation and leakage in certain areas.<ref>[http://www.international.icomos.org/risk/world_report/2000/moroc_2000.htm ICOMOS Heritage at Risk 2000]</ref> Still, some conservation and restoration efforts have taken place in recent years, motivated in part by the revenues of tourism.<ref name=":22" />{{Rp|222}} As of 2023, a number of major restoration projects were planned or underway, led by ADER-Fès (''Agence pour la Dédensification et la Réhabilitation de la Médina de Fès''), a quasi-governmental agency based in Fez. The projects include proposed restorations to the historic city walls, to the [[Heri es-Swani]], and to the Bou Inania Madrasa, along with other improvements to parking and tourism infrastructure.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Benabdellah |first=Yahya |date=2023-01-25 |title=Meknès : les projets de réhabilitation se multiplient dans l'ancienne médina |url=https://medias24.com/2023/01/25/meknes-les-projets-de-rehabilitation-se-multiplient-dans-lancienne-medina/ |access-date=2023-03-13 |website=Médias24 |language=fr-FR}}</ref>

==Geography==
Meknes is located in a strategic position in the heart of [[Morocco]]. To its south and south-east are the rich cedar forests and mountains of the [[Middle Atlas]] mountains with the cities [[Ifrane]] and [[Azrou]]; and more to the south are the rich oases of [[Tafilalet|Tafilalt]]. To the west are the two largest metropolitan areas of Morocco: [[Casablanca]] and [[Rabat]]. To the north is the mountainous north of [[Morocco]] with the cities of [[Tangier]] and [[Tétouan]]. [[Oujda]] and [[Fez, Morocco|Fes]] lie east of Meknes.

===Climate===
Meknes has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csa'') with continental influences. Its climate is similar to some inland cities in southern Portugal (such as [[Beja, Portugal|Beja]] or [[Évora]]) and some areas of southern Spain. The temperatures shifts from cool in winter to hot days in the summer months of June–September. Afternoon temperatures generally rise 10–14&nbsp;°C above the low on most days. The winter highs typically reach only {{convert|15.5|°C|1|abbr=on}} in December–January, whereas night temperatures average {{convert|5|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Snow is rare.

==Historic monuments and landmarks==
[[File:Meknes-medina-aerial-view.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Aerial view of the northern part of the old [[Medina quarter|medina]] of Meknes, near Bab Berda'in|alt=]]The main historic monuments of the city are concentrated in the [[Medina quarter|medina]] (old city) and the vast former [[Kasbah of Moulay Ismail]] to the south. The most notable monuments are listed below.

===Place el-Hedim===
[[File:Place el-hedim DSCF6041.jpg|thumb|Crowds gathering in el-Hedim Square at the end of the day |alt=]]
{{Anchor|Place el-Hedim}}

Often compared to the [[Jemaa el-Fnaa]] square in [[Marrakesh]], el-Hedim Square (Place el-Hedim) is a vast plaza at the southern end of the old city, before the main gates of Moulay Isma'il's former royal palace complex. The square's name, el-Hedim, means "the rubble/debris" and refers to the demolitions which Moulay Isma'il carried out here during the construction of his palaces. He left this open space as a public square to separate his palace from the rest of the city.<ref name=":52" /><ref name=":23" /> Since then, the square has become the focus of various activities including evening entertainers such as storytellers, acrobats, and musicians.<ref name=":11">{{Cite book|title=The Rough Guide to Morocco|publisher=Rough Guides|year=2019|edition=12th}}</ref>

===Imperial Palaces of Moulay Isma'il===
[[File:Kasbah_of_Moulay_Ismail_with_labels.png|alt=|thumb|357x357px|Map of the [[Kasbah of Moulay Ismail]] in relation to the medina (old city), with its major areas indicated]]
{{Main|Kasbah of Moulay Ismail}}
The palace complex or "imperial city" of Sultan Moulay Isma'il was constructed over his entire 55-year reign from 1672 to 1727 (with some elements finished or remodeled shortly after). It occupies the site of the city's former medieval [[kasbah]] (citadel) and stretches over an area approximately four times larger than the old city itself. It was composed of several autonomous palaces along with vast gardens, religious buildings, and other amenities. The complex was also notable for its impressive infrastructure, which included a water supply system with a hydraulic system of wells, norias (water extraction mechanism powered by wheel), canals, and underground pipes which distributed water to the royal city's many buildings. It also contained numerous monumental granaries and underground warehouses which stockpiled supplies that could allegedly sustain the city for a siege of ten years. Below is a list of some of its main areas and monuments.<ref name=":022"/><ref name=":52"/><ref name=":172">{{Cite book|last=Barrucand|first=Marianne|title=L'architecture de la Qasba de Moulay Ismaïl à Meknès|year=1980}}</ref><ref name=":123" /><ref name=":7" /><ref name=":3" />

* '''Place Lalla Aouda''': A vast open square which stands behind (southeast of) Bab al-Mansur, which served as the former ''[[mechouar]]'' of the palace. It precedes the former Dar al-Kebira palace and gives access to the [[Lalla Aouda Mosque]].<ref name=":23"/>
* '''Dar el-Kebira''': The oldest palace in the kasbah, finished in 1679 and itself composed of multiple palaces. Its name means "the Great House". It was the private residence of the sultan and his family, connected directly to the Lalla Aouda Mosque and the later royal mausoleum. The palace fell into ruin after Moulay Isma'il's death (and after the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake), and has since become a residential neighbourhood where common people built their houses amidst the remains of Isma'il's massive palace walls, still visible in various places.<ref name=":125"/>
* '''[[Mausoleum of Moulay Ismail|Mausoleum of Moulay Isma'il]]''': The royal mausoleum and funerary complex of Moulay Isma'il and some of his family members and successors. It was built under his reign but significantly modified by [[Abu'l Abbas Ahmad of Morocco|Ahmad ad-Dhahabi]] between 1727 and 1729. The funerary complex was originally entered from the dar al-Kebira to the north but is nowadays entered by a 20th-century gate to the south. Still considered a religious site today, it is also open to tourists. It is composed of relatively austere courtyards leading to a richly-decorated indoor [[patio]] chamber, which in turn grants access to the tomb chamber of the sultan.<ref name=":123" /><ref name=":125"/>
* '''Qubbat al-Khayyatin''' '''and the''' '''Qara Prison''': The Qubbat al-Khayyatin is a standalone audience chamber or throne room where Moulay Isma'il once received foreign ambassadors. Underground, right next to it, is a large subterranean vaulted space known as the [[Qara Prison]] or Habs Qara. Although frequently described as a prison for Christian slaves, scholars agree that it was in fact a storage area and granary, one of many such structures throughout the royal city.<ref name=":125"/><ref name=":123" /><ref name=":7" />
* '''Dar al-Makhzen''': This vast walled enclosure, much larger and more rationally organized than the Dar el-Kebira, contained extensive gardens and two more main palaces in Moulay Isma'il's time, some of which have been restored or adapted for current use as one of the royal residences of the [[List of rulers of Morocco|King of Morocco]]. The enclosure, generally known as the Dar al-Makhzen (not to be confused with the [[Dar al-Makhzen (Fez)|royal palaces of the same name in Fez]] and elsewhere), was divided into two sections. The western section was mostly occupied by the Bahrawiya Gardens but also contained a long narrow palace on its northern edge known as the Dar al-Madrasa ("House of the School"), most likely another private palace of the sultan. The eastern section, which is still entered via an ornate royal gate on its eastern perimeter (north of Heri es-Swani), was mostly occupied by the Qasr al-Muhannasha ("Palace of the Labyrinth"). This palace consisted of roughly eight large courtyards or garden enclosures and acted as both a reception palace and an administrative palace.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":52"/><ref name=":7" />
* [[Heri es-Swani|'''Heri as-Swani''' '''and the''' '''Sahrij (Agdal Basin)''']]: The Sahrij or Agdal Basin is an enormous water basin or artificial lake south of the Dar al-Makhzen, which was originally a part of the royal city's water supply system. It measures 148.75 by 319 meters and is, on average, 1.2 meters deep.<ref name=":123" /> Next to it, on its eastern side, is an enormous structure composed of two parts: the "House of the Ten Norias" or Dar al-Ma ("House of Water") and the Heri as-Swani (also spelled as Heri es-Souani). The first of these is a monumental building of vaulted passages and domed chambers which contained a number of wheel-powered hydraulic mechanisms ([[noria]]s) which drew water from the [[Phreatic zone|phreatic table]] underground to the surface, after which it was delivered into the Sahrij or redistributed to the city. The second part, the Heri as-Swani, is attached to the south side of this building and is made up of 22 rows of monumental arches which once held up a [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] roof (which has since collapsed). Although frequently misidentified as the "royal stables" of the palace, this structure was, once again, a massive granary and storehouse. Grain was originally delivered to the building by mules who climbed onto a roof terrace and dropped the grain directly into holes pierced above each vaulted chamber.<ref name=":123" /><ref name=":52"/><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":142">{{Cite web|title=Qantara - Basin of the Norias|url=https://www.qantara-med.org/public/show_document.php?do_id=317&lang=en|access-date=2020-06-07|website=www.qantara-med.org}}</ref>
* '''Heri al-Mansur''': One of the last constructions of Moulay Isma'il's reign, built between 1721 and 1725, its name means "Granary/silo of Victory", but it was also known as Dar al-Mansur<ref name=":132"/> or Qasr al-Mansur<ref name=":62">{{Cite web|title=Qasaba of Mawlāy Ismā'īl|url=https://www.qantara-med.org/public/show_document.php?do_id=297&lang=en|access-date=2020-06-07|website=www.qantara-med.org}}</ref> ("Palace of Victory"). It is located on the far southern perimeter of the Kasbah and consists of a massive building which seems to have served as a palace, fortress, and storehouse. The basement was taken up by storage rooms while the upper floor held reception rooms for the palace with views over the surrounding area. Located next to it were the Royal Stables of Moulay Isma'il (often misidentified today with the Heri as-Swani), which were reputed to be one of the palace city's most impressive features. It consisted of horse stalls sheltered under two parallel arcades (rows of arches) which stretched for 1200 meters on either side of a water canal which provided water for the horses. Unfortunately, the stables have not been preserved and very little remains of them today.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":52"/><ref name=":125"/><ref name=":022"/>{{Rp|396}}
