'''Tuzla''' ({{Lang-sh-Cyrl|Тузла}}, {{IPA|sh|tûzla|ba|bs-Tuzla.ogg}}) is the [[List of cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina|third-largest city]] of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the administrative center of [[Tuzla Canton]] of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. As of 2013, it has a population of 110,979 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhas.ba/obavjestenja/Preliminarni_rezultati_bos.pdf|title=Preliminary Results Of the 2013 Census of Population, Households and Dwellings in Bosnia and Herzegovina|publisher=Agency for Statistics of Bosnia and Herzegovina|date=5 November 2013|access-date=10 November 2013|archive-date=23 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123135507/http://www.bhas.ba/obavjestenja/Preliminarni_rezultati_bos.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

It is also the main industrial machine and one of the leading economic strongholds of the country with a wide and varied industrial sector including an expanding service sector thanks to its salt lake [[tourism]].

The city of Tuzla is home to [[Europe]]'s only salt lake as part of its central park and has more than 350,000 people visiting its shores every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oslobodjenje.ba/o2/rodni-kraj/turizam/panonska-jezera-posjetilo-vise-od-350-000-gostiju|title=Oslobođenje – Panonska jezera posjetilo više od 350.000 gostiju|first=Oslobođenje|last=PORTAL|date=24 August 2017|access-date=3 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world66.com/europe/bosniaandherzegovina/tuzla/history |title=Tuzla Culture &#124; Tuzla History |publisher=World66.com |access-date=2013-11-24}}</ref> The history of the city goes back to the 9th century; modern Tuzla dates back to 1510 when it became an important garrison town in the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/610805/Tuzla |title=Tuzla (Bosnia and Herzegovina) – Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |access-date=2013-11-24}}</ref>

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Tuzla is also regarded as one of the most multicultural cities in the country and has managed to keep the pluralist character of the city throughout the [[Bosnian War]] and after, with [[Bosniaks]], [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Serbs]], [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Croats]] and a small minority of [[History of the Jews in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Jews]] residing in Tuzla.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondintractability.org/resources/tolerance |title=Tolerance: Additional Resources |publisher=Beyond Intractability |access-date=2013-11-24}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name Tuzla is the [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]  word for salt mine, ''tuzla'', and refers to the extensive salt deposits found underneath the city, mined for export as a large source of Ottoman tax revenue. Leveraging on their shared name, the city is [[town twinning|twinned]] with [[Tuzla, Istanbul|Tuzla]], a suburb of [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]].

==History==
===Early history===
Archaeological evidence suggests that Tuzla was a rich [[Neolithic]] settlement. Being inhabited continuously for more than 6,000 years, Tuzla is one of the oldest [[Europe]]an sustained settlements. During the period of the [[Roman Republic]] (before the area was conquered by [[Roman Republic|Rome]]), Tuzla (or Salines as it was called at the time) was ruled by the [[Illyrian tribe]] [[List of ancient tribes in Illyria#Breuci|Breuci]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GwmrAbUXuMsC&q=breuci+tuzla&pg=PA361|title=Rimski vuk i ilirska zmija.

===Middle Ages to 20th century===
[[File:Durch Bosnien und die Herzegovina kreuz und quer; Wanderungen (1897) (14595283388).jpg|thumb|left|Tuzla town, 1897]]

The city was first mentioned in 950 by [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]] in his [[De Administrando Imperio]] as a fort named ''Salines'' ({{langx|el|Σαλήνες}}). The name ''[[Soli (region)|Soli]]'' was used in the Middle Ages. It means "[[salt]]s" in [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] and the city's present name means "place of salt" in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]].<ref name=JA>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TqIEAAAAQAAJ|title=The Journal of the Anthropological institute|website=Books.google.com|year=1879|access-date=30 December 2015}}</ref>
During the Middle Ages it belonged mostly to the medieval [[Kingdom of Bosnia]].

After the fall of the kingdom to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1463, the region was controlled by the [[Berislavići Grabarski|House of Berislavić]] before the Ottomans occupied the villages of "Gornje Soli" and "Donje Soli" around 1512, and took control of the entire [[Usora (region)|Usora]] in the 1530s.

It remained under Ottoman rule for nearly 400 years, where it was administered as part of the [[Sanjak of Zvornik]]. In 1878 it was occupied by [[Austria-Hungary]]. After the dissolution of the monarchy it became the part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. The [[Husino uprising]] took place in 1920.

During the [[Second World War]], Tuzla was included in the puppet [[Independent State of Croatia]] and controlled by the mainly Muslim [[Hadžiefendić Legion]] of the [[Croatian Home Guard (World War II)|Croatian Home Guard]].<ref name=redzic>Redžić, Enver (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=mXiSKULRN-oC Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Second World War]. Abingdon: Frank Cass. {{ISBN|978-0-7146-5625-0}}, p. 223</ref>
Tuzla was among the first areas in Europe to be liberated, when Tito's [[Yugoslav Partisans]] freed it from the German occupiers on 2 October 1943.<ref>[http://www.sarajevotimes.com/70-years-of-tuzla-liberation/ Sarajevo Times]</ref> Many members of the Legion deserted to the Partisans at this time.<ref name=redzic />
In December 1944, the city was unsuccessfully attacked by [[Chetnik]] forces of [[Draža Mihailović]] along with the [[Serbian State Guard]].<ref>{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.sedmica.co.yu/feljton92.htm |date= |title=Dimitrije Ljotić and his ZBOR }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bhstring.net/tuzlauslikama/tuzlarije/viewnewnews.php?id=18656 |title=Tuzlarije |publisher=Bhstring.net |access-date=2013-11-24}}</ref>

After the war it developed into a major industrial and cultural centre during the [[Communist]] period in the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].

===Bosnian War===
{{Main|1992 Yugoslav People's Army column incident in Tuzla|25 May 1995 Tuzla massacre}}
[[File:Kapija 2018.jpg|thumb|The [[25 May 1995 Tuzla massacre|Tuzla massacre]] memorial]]

In the [[1990 Bosnian municipal elections|1990 elections]] the [[Union of Reform Forces of Yugoslavia|Reformists]] won control of the municipality being the only municipality in Bosnia where non-nationalists won. During the [[Bosnian War|Bosnian War of Independence]] between 1992 and 1995 the town was the only municipality not governed by the [[Party of Democratic Action|SDA party]]-led authorities. After Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence and was recognized by the [[United Nations]] the city was besieged by [[Army of Republika Srpska|Serbian forces]]. A few days later Serbian forces attacked Tuzla. The town was not spared the atrocities of the Bosnian War.

Early in the war, troops of the 92nd Motorised Brigade of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] were [[1992 Yugoslav People's Army column incident in Tuzla|ambushed]] by units of Bosnia's [[Territorial Defence Force of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Territorial Defence Force]], while attempting to withdraw from the city. During the incident, an estimated 92–200 Yugoslav troops were killed, and 33 wounded. It was regarded as a war crime.{{by whom|date=March 2022}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2022}}

On 25 May 1995, an attack on Tuzla killed 71 people and injured 200 persons in what is referred to as the [[Tuzla massacre]], when shells fired from Serb's positions on the Ozren mountain (130&nbsp;mm towed field gun [[130 mm towed field gun M1954 (M-46)|M-46]]) hit the central street and its promenade. The youngest civilian who died in that massacre was only two years old.

Following the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Peace Accords]], Tuzla was the headquarters of the U.S. forces for the Multinational Division (MND) during Operation Joint Endeavour [[Implementation Force|IFOR]] and subsequent [[SFOR]].

===Post-war independence===
[[File:Bosnian social protests Tuzla.jpg|thumb|[[Tuzla Canton]] Government Building in flames during the [[2014 unrest in Bosnia and Herzegovina]].]]

In February 2014, the city was the scene of the beginning of the [[2014 unrest in Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which quickly spread to dozens of cities and towns throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina. After a couple of days of calm protests, people lost patience and started burning cars in front of the [[Tuzla Canton|canton government]] building, and later the building itself.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.france24.com/en/20140207-bosnia-herzegovina-tuzla-protest-riot-unemployment/ | title = Anti-government protests turn violent in Bosnia | publisher = France 24 | date = 7 February 2014 | access-date = 7 February 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140207125724/http://www.france24.com/en/20140207-bosnia-herzegovina-tuzla-protest-riot-unemployment/ | archive-date = 7 February 2014 | url-status = dead}}</ref>

Recent years have seen economic growth as well as increases in tourism.<ref name="tourism"/>

==Geography==
[[File:Tuzla Valley coal mines.jpg|thumb|Tuzla valley (coal mines, lakes, airport)]]

Tuzla is located in the northeastern part of Bosnia, settled just underneath the Majevica mountain range, on the Jala River. The central zone lies in an east–west oriented plain, with residential areas in the north and south of the city located on the Ilinčica, Kicelj and Gradina Hills. It is {{convert|237|m|ft|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].  The climate is moderate [[continental climate|continental]]. There are abundant [[coal]] deposits in the region around Tuzla. 6 [[coal mines]] continue to operate around the city.  Much of the coal mined in the area is used to power the [[Tuzla Thermal Power Plant]], which is the largest power plant in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

===Salt deposits===
Extractions of the city's salt deposits, particularly in the 20th century, have caused sections of the city center to sink. Structures in the "sinking area" either collapsed or were demolished, and there are few structures in the city that predate the 20th century, despite the fact that the city was founded over 1000 years ago. In the northeastern part of the town is an area known as [[Solina, Tuzla|Solina]], named after the salt deposits.

===Pannonian Lakes===
{{Main|Pannonian Lakes}}
[[File:Panonsko jezero.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Pannonian Lakes.]]

Tuzla is the only city in Europe that has a [[salt lake]] in its centre. The ancient Pannonian Sea dried up around 10 million years ago, but work by researchers and scientists has now enabled a level of saline water to be kept stable at the surface, and in 2003 the [[Pannonian Lakes|Pannonian Lake]] was opened.

A second lake that includes [[artificial waterfall]]s was inaugurated in 2008. An archaeological park and replica Neolithic lake dwellings were also incorporated into the scheme, providing information about the different cultures which left their material and spiritual mark here. The site has become an international tourist destination.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adriaticoinfiore.eu/english/partners/tuzla.html |title=Tuzla – INFIORE Project |publisher=Adriaticoinfiore.eu |access-date=2013-11-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005004153/http://www.adriaticoinfiore.eu/english/partners/tuzla.html |archive-date=2013-10-05 }}</ref>

A third lake was completed in August 2012. Construction expenses for this were nearly 2 million Bosnian marks (ca. 1 million euros). This third lake also contains 2 water slides which are an attraction for the younger population.

The summer season of 2013 recorded approximately 5,000 visitors per day (c. 450,000 for 3 months).{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Climate==
Tuzla has a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') with warm summers which have 100.6 days annually with maximum temperature above {{Convert|25|C|F|abbr=on}} 36.3 days above {{Convert|30|C|F|abbr=on}}. Tuzla has cold and chilly winters, with 85.8 days having minimum temperature below {{Convert|0|C|F|abbr=on}}, as well as 14.9 days in which the maximum temperature is also below freezing.<ref name=NCEI/>

There are 38.7 days per year with [[thunder]] and 2.1 days with [[hail]], both of them being more common in spring and summer than other seasons.<ref name=NCEI/>

The highest recorded temperature is {{Convert|40.7|C|F|abbr=on}} on 22 July 2007.<ref name=NCEI/>

This kind of music was enjoyed by all three peoples in Bosnia, Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs, and it contributed a lot to reconcile people socializing, entertainment and other organizations through festivala.

With its entirely new form of modernity, it is most common in the [[Tuzla Canton]] and the cradle of this music city [[Živinice]] was named Bosnian town of original music. Songs are performed preferably in a [[diphthong]], the first and second voice which is a special secret performance of this music and some performers sing in troglasju as they do Kalesijski triple that was recorded in 1968, as the first written record of the tone on the album, along with Higurashi no naku.
