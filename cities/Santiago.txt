Santiago's cityscape is defined by several [[Inselberg|stand-alone hills]] and the fast-flowing [[Mapocho River]], which is lined by parks such as  [[Parque Bicentenario]], [[Parque Forestal]], and [[Parque de la Familia]]. The [[Andes|Andes Mountains]] are visible from most parts of the city and contribute to a [[smog]] problem, particularly during winter due to the lack of rain. The outskirts of the city are surrounded by vineyards, and Santiago is within an hour's drive of both the mountains and the Pacific Ocean.

Santiago is the political and financial center of Chile and hosts the regional headquarters of many [[multinational corporation]]s and [[International organization|organizations]]. The Chilean government's executive and judiciary branches are based in Santiago, while the Congress mostly meets in nearby [[Valparaíso]].

== Etymology ==
In Chile, several entities share the name ''Santiago'', which can often lead to confusion. The [[Santiago (commune)|commune of Santiago]], also referred to as ''Santiago Centro'', is an [[Administrative divisions of Chile|administrative division]] encompassing the area occupied by the city during colonial times. It is governed by the Municipality of Santiago and led by a mayor. This commune is part of [[Santiago Province, Chile|Santiago Province]], which is headed by a provincial delegate appointed by the President of the Republic, and it is also part of the Santiago Metropolitan Region, governed by a [[Governor of the Santiago Metropolitan Region|popularly elected governor]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Re-Solution: Claudio Orrego, Governor of the Santiago Metropolitan Region |url=https://events.ie.edu/all-events/event/re-solution-claudio-orrego-governor-of-the-santiago-metropolitan-region |access-date=2024-09-04 |website=IE University}}</ref>

When the term ''Santiago'' is used without further clarification, it typically refers to ''Gran Santiago'' (Greater Santiago), the [[metropolitan area]] characterized by continuous urban development. This area includes the [[Santiago (commune)|commune of Santiago]] and over 40 other communes, encompassing much of [[Santiago Province, Chile|Santiago Province]] and [[Santiago#Administrative divisions|parts of neighboring provinces]]. The definition of the metropolitan area has evolved over time as the city has expanded, incorporating smaller cities and rural areas.

The name ''Santiago'' was chosen by the Spanish conqueror [[Pedro de Valdivia]] when he founded the city in 1541 as "Santiago del Nuevo Extremo," in reference to his home region of [[Extremadura]] and as a tribute to [[James the Great]], the [[patron saint]] of [[Spain]]. The saint's name appears in various forms in Spanish, such as [[Diego]], [[Jaime]], [[Jacobo]], or [[Santiago (name)|Santiago]], with the latter derived from the [[Galician language|Galician]] evolution of [[Vulgar Latin]] ''Sanctu Iacobu''.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-07-05 |title=James the Apostle – St. Paul Anglican Church |url=https://www.stpaulbarbados.org/james-the-apostle/ |access-date=2024-09-05 |website=Saint Paul Church |language=en-GB}}</ref> Allegedly, there was no indigenous name for the area where Santiago is located, but the [[Mapuche language]] uses the adapted name ''Santiaw''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hernández Sallés |first=Arturo |title=Gramática básica de la lengua mapuche |last2=Ramos Pizarro |first2=Nelly |last3=Huenchulaf Cayuqueo |first3=Rosa |publisher=Editorial UC Temuco |year=2006 |isbn=956-7019-21-5 |pages=79 |language=es |trans-title=Basic Grammar of the Mapuche Language}}</ref>

Residents of the city and region are referred to as ''santiaguinos'' (for males) and ''santiaguinas'' (for females).

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Santiago de Chile}}

===Prehistory===
Archaeological evidence suggests that the first human groups arrived in the Santiago basin around the 10th millennium BC.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=De Ramón |first=Armando |title=Santiago de Chile (1541-1991): Historia de una sociedad urbana |publisher=Editorial Sudamericana |year=2000 |language=es |trans-title=Santiago de Chile (1541-1991): History of an Urban Society}}</ref> These groups were primarily nomadic hunter-gatherers, traveling from the coast to the interior to hunt guanacos during the Andean snowmelt. By around 800 AD, the first permanent settlers established agricultural communities along the [[Mapocho River]], where they cultivated crops such as [[maize]], [[Potato|potatoes]], and [[Bean|beans]], and domesticated camelids.<ref name=":0" />

The villages of the [[Picunche]] people (as they were known to Chileans) or the [[Promaucae]] (as referred to by the Incas) were under [[Inca Empire|Inca rule]] from the late 15th century to the early 16th century. The Incas established a settlement of [[Mitma|mitimas]] in the valley, located in the center of present-day Santiago, with fortifications such as [[Huaca de Chena]] and the [[Cerro El Plomo|El Plomo hill]] sanctuary. According to Chilean historian [[Armando de Ramón]], the area served as a base for failed Inca expeditions to the south and was a junction along the [[Inca road system|Inca Trail]].<ref name=":0" />

===Founding of the city===

The artwork depicts Pedro de Valdivia and Juan Martín de Candia, proclaiming the founding of the city.<ref>Pobladores de Chile, 1565–1580, libro de Juan Guillermo Muñoz Correa, Ediciones Universidad de la Frontera, Temuco, 1989.</ref>]]
[[File:Ines de Suarez 2.JPG|thumb|upright=0.75|''Inés de Suárez in Defense of the City of Santiago'' (1897), oil painting by José Mercedes Ortega.]]
[[Pedro de Valdivia]], a conquistador from [[Extremadura]] sent by [[Francisco Pizarro]] from [[Peru]], arrived in the Mapocho valley on 13 December 1540, after a long journey from [[Cusco]]. Valdivia and his party camped by the river on the slopes of the [[San Cristóbal Hill|Tupahue hill]] and gradually began interacting with the [[Picunche people]] who lived in the area. Valdivia later called a meeting with the local chiefs, during which he explained his plan to establish a city on behalf of [[Charles IV of Spain]]. The city would serve as the capital of his governorship of [[Nueva Extremadura]]. 

On 12 February 1541, Valdivia officially founded the city of ''Santiago del Nuevo Extremo'' (''Santiago of New Extremadura'') in honor of the [[James the Great|Apostle James]], the patron saint of Spain. The city was established near Huelén, which Valdivia renamed Santa Lucía. He assigned the city's layout to master builder [[Pedro de Gamboa]], who designed a [[grid plan]]. At its center, Gamboa placed a [[Plaza de Armas (Santiago)|Plaza Mayor]], which became the town's central hub.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last=Ledermann |first=Walter |date=February 2021 |title=De cómo se gestó el alcantarillado de Santiago de Chile |trans-title=About How the Sewerage System in Santiago de Chile Was Developed |url=https://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0716-10182021000100102 |journal=Revista Chilena de Infectología |volume=38}}</ref> Surrounding the plaza, plots were designated for the [[Santiago Metropolitan Cathedral|cathedral]], the jail, and the [[Royal Governor of Chile|governor's house]]. The city was divided into eight blocks from north to south and ten blocks from east to west, between the Mapocho River and the ''Cañada'' with each quarter-block, or ''solar'', granted to settlers.<ref name=":1" /> The [[Architecture of Chile|colonial architecture]] following the grid plan consisted of one or two-story houses, adobe walls, tile roofs, and rooms around interior corridors and [[Patio|patios]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Valencia |first=Nicolás |date=2022-11-23 |title=Santiago Architecture City Guide: 41 Buildings, Complexes and Parks to Visit in the Chilean Capital |url=https://www.archdaily.com/992337/santiago-architecture-city-41-buildings-complexes-and-parks-to-visit-in-the-chilean-capital |access-date=2024-09-08 |website=ArchDaily |language=en-US}}</ref>

Valdivia left for the south with his troops months later, initiating the [[Arauco War]]. Santiago was left vulnerable, and a coalition of Mapuche and Picunche tribes led by chief [[Michimalonco]] [[Destruction of Santiago|destroyed the city]] on 11 September 1541, despite the efforts of a Spanish garrison of 55 soldiers defending the fort. The defense was led by Spanish [[Conquistador|conquistadora]] [[Inés Suárez|Inés de Suárez]]. When she realized they were being overpowered, she ordered the execution of all indigenous prisoners, displaying their heads on pikes and throwing some towards the attackers. In response to this brutal act, the indigenous forces dispersed in fear.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Moulian |first=Rodrigo |last2=Poblete |first2=María Pía |date=December 2018 |title=Katulongkon: contextualización y antecedentes transculturales del simbolismo de la cabeza entre los Reche-Mapuche |trans-title=Katulongkon: Contextualization and Transcultural Background of Head Symbolism Among the Reche-Mapuche |url=https://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0718-10432018000400213#f3 |journal=Estudios Atacameños |volume=60 |via=Scielo}}</ref> The city was gradually rebuilt, with the newly established city of [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]] gaining political prominence as the [[Real Audiencia of Concepción|Royal Audiencia of Chile]] was established there in 1565. However, the ongoing threat of the Arauco War and frequent earthquakes delayed the establishment of the Royal Court in Santiago until 1607, which solidified the city's status as the capital.

During the early years of the city, the Spanish suffered from severe shortages of food and other supplies. The [[Picunche|Picunches]] had adopted a strategy of halting cultivation and retreating to more remote locations,<ref name=leon1991/> which isolated the Spanish and forced them to resort to eating whatever they could find. The shortage of clothing meant that some Spanish had to dress with [[hide (skin)|hides]] from dogs, cats, [[South American sea lion|sea lions]], and [[South American fox|foxes]].<ref name=leon1991>{{Cite book |last=León |first=Leonardo |url=http://www.memoriachilena.gob.cl/archivos2/pdfs/MC0012923.pdf |title=La merma de la sociadad indígena en Chile central y la última guerra de los promaucaes |publisher=Institute of Amerindian Studies, University of St. Andrews |year=1991 |isbn=1873617003 |pages=13–16 |language=es |author-link=Leonardo León |access-date=9 September 2019 |archive-date=28 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211028092709/http://www.memoriachilena.gob.cl/archivos2/pdfs/MC0012923.pdf |url-status=live }}<!--|access-date=August 27, 2019 --></ref>

===Colonial Santiago===
[[File:Plan de la Ville de Santiago.jpg|thumb|Map of colonial Santiago in 1712 by [[Amédée-François Frézier|Frézier]] and [[Jacques-Nicolas Bellin|Bellin]].]]
[[File:Iglesia de Santo Domingo, Santiago, 2017-09-24.jpg|thumb|130px|Preserved colonial [[Santo Domingo Church, Santiago de Chile|Church of Santo Domingo]], built between 1747 and 1796.]]
Although Santiago was facing the threat of permanent destruction early on, due to attacks from indigenous peoples, earthquakes, and floods, the city began to grow rapidly. Out of the 126 blocks designed by Pedro de Gamboa in 1558, 40 were occupied. In 1580, the first major buildings in the city started to be erected, marked by the placement of the foundation stone of the first Cathedral in 1561 and the building of the [[Iglesia de San Francisco, Santiago de Chile|church of San Francisco]] in 1572. Both of these structures were primarily made of adobe and stone. In addition to the construction of significant buildings, the city began to thrive as the surrounding areas welcomed tens of thousands of livestock.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, the growth of the city was hindered by a series of disasters including an [[1575 Valdivia earthquake|earthquake]], a [[smallpox]] epidemic in 1575, the Mapocho River floods in 1590, 1608, and 1618, and a devastating [[1647 Santiago earthquake|earthquake]] on 13 May 1647 which resulted in the death of over 600 people and affected over 5,000 others. Despite these setbacks, the capital of the [[Captaincy General of Chile]] continued to grow, with all the power of the country being centered on the [[Plaza de Armas (Santiago)|Plaza de Armas]] in Santiago.

In 1767, the corregidor Luis Manuel de Zañartu launched one of the most significant architectural projects of the colonial period, the Calicanto Bridge, connecting the city to La Chimba on the north side of the Mapocho River. He also began constructing [[Starling (architecture)|embankments]] to prevent river overflows. Although the bridge was completed, its piers were frequently damaged by the river. In 1780, Governor [[Agustín de Jáuregui]] hired the Italian architect [[Joaquín Toesca]], who designed several important buildings, including the cathedral's façade, the [[Palacio de La Moneda]], the [[San Carlos Canal]], and the completion of the embankments during the government of [[Ambrosio O'Higgins]]. These works were officially opened in 1798. The O'Higgins government also opened the road to [[Valparaíso]] in 1791, connecting the capital with the country's main port.

===Capital of the Republic===
[[File:Battle of Maipu.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Maipú]], 1818]]
On September 18, 1810, the [[Government Junta of Chile (1810)|First Government Junta]] was proclaimed in Santiago, marking the beginning of [[Independence of Chile|Chile’s path to independence]]. The city, which became the capital of the newly formed nation, faced various challenges, particularly from [[Chilean War of Independence|military actions]] in the vicinity.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last=Collier |first=Simon |title=A History of Chile, 1808-2002 |last2=F. Sater |first2=William |date=2004-10-18 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |pages=33}}</ref>

Although institutions like the [[Instituto Nacional General José Miguel Carrera|Instituto Nacional]] and the [[National Library of Chile|National Library]] were established during the [[Old Fatherland|Patria Vieja]], they were shut down after the patriots’ defeat at the [[Battle of Rancagua]] in 1814.<ref name=":2" /> The [[Reconquest (Chile)|royal government]] continued until 1817, when the [[Army of the Andes]] emerged victorious at the [[Battle of Chacabuco]] and restored the patriot government in Santiago. However, independence was still uncertain. The Spanish army achieved further victories in 1818 and advanced toward Santiago, but their progress was finally halted at the [[Battle of Maipú]] on April 5, 1818, on the Maipo River plains.<ref name=":2" />

[[File:Tertulia por Claudio Gay.jpg|thumb|Painting of 1840 by [[Claude Gay]] depicting a [[tertulia]] of Santiago neighbors.]]
With the end of the war, [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] was accepted as [[Supreme Director of Chile|Supreme Director]] and, like his father, undertook several important projects for the city. During the [[New Fatherland|Patria Nueva]] era, previously closed institutions were reopened. The [[Santiago General Cemetery|General Cemetery]] was inaugurated, work on the San Carlos Canal was completed, and the drying riverbed in the south arm of the Mapocho River, known as La Cañada, which had been used as a landfill for some time, was transformed into an avenue now known as the [[Avenida Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins|Alameda de las Delicias]].

Two earthquakes struck the city in the 19th century: one on November 19, 1822, and another on February 20, 1835. Despite these disasters, the city continued to grow rapidly. In 1820, the population was recorded as 46,000, but by 1854, it had risen to 69,018. By 1865, the census reported 115,337 residents. This significant increase was due to suburban expansion to the south and west of the capital, as well as the growth of the bustling district of La Chimba, which resulted from the division of old properties in the area. This new peripheral development marked the end of the previous checkerboard structure that had dominated the city center.

===19th century===
[[File:Plano de Santiago, por Nicolás Boloña.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Map of Santiago in 1895.]]
During the Republican era, several institutions were founded, including the [[University of Chile]], the Normal School of Preceptors, the School of Arts and Crafts, and the [[Quinta Normal Park|Quinta Normal]]. The latter comprised the Museum of Fine Arts (now the Museum of Science and Technology) and the [[Chilean National Museum of Natural History|National Museum of Natural History]]. These institutions were established primarily for educational purposes, but also served as examples of public planning during that period. In 1851, the first telegraph system connecting the capital to the Port of Valparaíso was inaugurated.<ref name="history">{{Cite book |last=Anson Uriel Hancock |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mUBGAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA17 |title=A History of Chile |publisher=C.

During the "Liberal Republic" and the administration of Mayor [[Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna]], a new phase in the urban development of the capital was initiated. One of the main projects during this period was the remodeling of [[Cerro Santa Lucía]], which had fallen into disrepair despite its central location.<ref name="history" /> In his effort to transform Santiago, Vicuña Mackenna initiated the construction of the ''Camino de Cintura'', a road surrounding the entire city. The redevelopment of [[Alameda Avenue]] also took place during this time, turning it into the city's main road.

Also during this era, [[Parque O'Higgins|O'Higgins Park]] was established with the help of European landscapers in 1873. The public park, known for its large gardens, lakes, and carriage trails, became a landmark in Santiago. Other notable structures were also opened during this period, including the [[Municipal Theater of Santiago|Teatro Municipal]] opera house and the [[Club Hípico de Santiago]]. In addition, the 1875 [[Chilean International Exhibition|International Exposition]] was held in the Quinta Normal grounds.<ref name="parqueohiggins">{{Cite web |last=Martín |date=29 May 2007 |title=Past, present, and future images of a "green space" in the metropolitan area of Santiago |url=http://revistaurbanismo.uchile.cl/n3/dominguez/dominguez.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313204531/http://revistaurbanismo.uchile.cl/n3/dominguez/dominguez.html |archive-date=13 March 2007 |access-date=18 May 2015 |publisher=Revista Urbanismo, Nº3 |language=es}}</ref>

Santiago emerged as the central hub of the national railway system. On 14 September 1857, the first railway arrived in the city and terminated at the [[Santiago Estación Central railway station]], which was under construction at the time and officially opened in 1884. During this period, rail lines connected Santiago to Valparaíso and regions in northern and southern Chile. The streets of Santiago were also paved, and by 1875, there were 1,107 railway cars in the city, while 45,000 people used trams daily.

===The centennial Santiago===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2024}}[[File:Iglesia de la Compañia - Chile.JPG|thumb|A Jesuit Church in Santiago in 1857, by Charles Barbant and Son for ''[[Le Monde Illustré]]''.]]

As the new century began, Santiago underwent various changes due to the rapid growth of industry. Valparaíso, which had previously been the economic center of the country, gradually lost its prominence to the capital. By 1895, 75% of the national manufacturing industry was located in Santiago, while only 28% was in Valparaíso. By 1910, major banks and shops had established themselves in the central streets of Santiago, further diminishing the role of Valparaíso.

The enactment of the Autonomous Municipalities Act empowered municipalities to establish various administrative divisions within the Santiago department, with the goal of enhancing local governance. In 1891, the municipalities of [[Maipú, Chile|Maipú]], [[Ñuñoa]], [[Renca]], [[Lampa, Chile|Lampa]], and [[Colina, Chile|Colina]] were created, followed by [[Providencia, Chile|Providencia]] and [[Pudahuel|Barrancas]] in 1897, and [[Las Condes]] in 1901. The La Victoria ''departmento'' was also divided, leading to the creation of Lo Cañas in 1891, which was then further split into [[La Granja, Chile|La Granja]] and [[Puente Alto]] in 1892, followed by [[La Florida, Chile|La Florida]] in 1899, and [[La Cisterna]] in 1925.

The [[San Cristóbal Hill|San Cristobal Hill]] underwent a prolonged process of development during this period. In 1903, an [[astronomical observatory]] was established on the hill, and the following year, construction began on a {{Convert|14|m|adj=on}} statue of the [[Virgin Mary]]. Today, the statue is visible from various points in the city. However, the shrine was not completed until several decades later.

The 1910 Chile Centennial celebrations marked the beginning of several urban development projects. The railway network was expanded, connecting the city and its growing suburbs with a new ring and route to [[Cajón del Maipo]]. A new railway station was also built in the north of the city: the [[Estación Mapocho|Mapocho Station]]. The [[Parque Forestal]] was established on the southern side of the Mapocho river, and new buildings such as the [[Chilean National Museum of Fine Arts|Museum of Fine Arts]], the [[Internado Nacional Barros Arana|Barros Arana public boarding school]], and the [[Biblioteca Nacional de Chile|National Library]] were opened. In addition, a sewer system was installed, serving approximately 85% of the city's population.

=== Population explosion ===
[[File:Santiago de Chile at 1929.jpg|thumb|200px|View of [[Paseo Ahumada]], in the city center, in the late 1920s.]]
The 1920 census estimated the population of Santiago to be 507,296 inhabitants, equivalent to 13.6% of the total population of Chile. This represented a growth of 52.5% from the 1907 census, an annual increase of 3.3%, which was almost three times the national average. This growth was mainly due to an influx of farmers from the southern regions who came to work in the factories and railroads that were being built. However, this growth was concentrated in the suburbs and not in the city center.

During this time, the downtown district consolidated as a commercial, financial, and administrative center, with the establishment of various shops and businesses around [[Paseo Ahumada|Ahumada Street]] and a Civic District in the vicinity of the Palace of La Moneda. The latter project involved the construction of modernist buildings for the offices of the [[Ministries of Chile|ministries]] and other public services, as well as the start of the construction of medium-rise buildings. Meanwhile, the traditional residents of the center began to migrate to more rural areas like Providencia and Ñuñoa, which attracted the oligarchy and [[Immigration to Chile|European immigrant]] professionals, and [[San Miguel, Chile|San Miguel]] for middle-class families. Additionally, in the periphery, villas were built by various organizations of the time. Modernity also spread in the city, with the introduction of the first theaters, the expansion of the telephone network, and the opening of Los Cerrillos Airport in 1928, among other advancements.
[[File:Ollas comunes en 1932.jpg|thumbnail|left|130px|Women prepare community soup kitchens in 1932 to feed the unemployed.]]

The perception that the early 20th century was a time of economic prosperity due to technological advancements was in stark contrast to the living conditions of lower social classes. The previous decades of growth resulted in an unprecedented population boom starting in 1929, but was met with tragedy as the [[Great Depression]] hit. The collapse of the nitrate industry in the north left 60,000 people unemployed, compounded by a decline in agricultural exports, resulting in an estimated 300,000 unemployed people nationwide. Desperate for survival, many migrants flocked to Santiago and its thriving industry. However, they often found themselves struggling to find housing, with many being forced to live on the streets. The harsh living conditions resulted in widespread diseases like tuberculosis, and took a toll on the homeless population. At the same time, unemployment rates and living costs skyrocketed, while the salaries of the people in Santiago fell.

[[File:Santiago de Chile 1930.jpg|thumbnail|View of [[Avenida Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins|La Alameda]] in 1930.]]
The situation would change several years later with a new industrial boom fostered by [[CORFO]]  and the expansion of the state apparatus from the late 1930s. At this time, the aristocracy lost much of its power, and the middle class, composed of merchants, bureaucrats, and professionals, acquired the role of setting national policy. In this context, Santiago began to develop a substantial middle- and lower-class population, while the upper classes sought refuge in the districts of the capital. Thus, the old moneyed class, who previously frequented Cousiño and Alameda Park, lost their hegemony over popular entertainment venues, and the [[Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos|National Stadium]] emerged in 1938.

In the following decades, Santiago continued to grow at an unprecedented rate. In 1940, the city had a population of 952,075 residents, which increased to 1,350,409 by 1952, and reached 1,907,378 in the 1960 census. This growth was reflected in the urbanization of rural areas on the outskirts of the city, where middle and lower-class families with stable housing were established. In 1930, the urban area covered 6,500 hectares, which increased to 20,900 in 1960 and to 38,296 in 1980. Although growth was mainly concentrated in communities such as Barrancas to the west, [[Conchalí]] to the north, and La Cisterna and La Granja to the south, the center of the city lost population, leaving more space for commercial, banking, and government development. The upper class, on the other hand, began to settle in the foothills of Las Condes and the [[La Reina, Chile|La Reina]] sector.

The regulation of growth in Santiago only began in the 1960s with the creation of various development plans for Greater Santiago, a concept that reflected the city's new reality as a much larger urban center. In 1958, the Intercommunal Plan of Santiago was released, which proposed a limit of 38,600 urban and semi-urban hectares for a maximum population of 3,260,000 residents. The plan also included plans for the construction of new avenues, such as the [[Américo Vespucio Avenue]] and [[Chile Route 5|Panamericana Route 5]], as well as the expansion of 'industrial belts'. The [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962 World Cup]] provided a new impetus for city improvement efforts, and in 1966, the [[Santiago Metropolitan Park]] was established on Cerro San Cristóbal. The Ministry of Housing and Urbanism ([[:es:Ministerio de Vivienda y Urbanismo de Chile|MINVU]]) also began to eradicate [[Campamento (Chile)|shantytowns]] and build new homes. Finally, the [[Centro Cultural Gabriela Mistral|Edificio Diego Portales]] was constructed in 1972.

[[File:1965 3ra etapa.jpg|thumbnail|left|Extension of Greater Santiago, in 1965.]]
In 1967, the new [[Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport|Pudahuel International Airport]] was opened, and after years of discussion, construction of the [[Santiago Metro]] began in 1969. The first phase of the Metro, which ran beneath the western section of Alameda, was opened in 1975 and soon became one of the most prestigious buildings in the city. Over the following years, the Metro continued to expand, with two perpendicular lines in place by the end of 1978. Building telecommunications infrastructure was also an important development of this period, as reflected in the construction of the [[Torre Entel]], which, since its construction in 1975, has become one of the symbols of the capital and remained the tallest structure in the country for two decades.

After the military [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|coup of 1973]] and the establishment of the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|military regime]], significant changes in urban planning did not occur until the 1980s when the government embraced a [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic model. In 1979, the master plan was revised, expanding the urban area to over 62,000 hectares for real estate development. This led to [[urban sprawl]], particularly in [[La Florida, Chile|La Florida]], causing the city to reach 40,619 hectares in size in the early 1990s. According to the 1992 census, Santiago became the country's most populous municipality, with 328,881 residents. Tragically, a powerful [[1985 Algarrobo earthquake|earthquake]] struck the city on 3 March 1985, causing minimal casualties but leaving many homeless and destroying numerous historic buildings.

[[File:Santiago from sky costanera 2018.jpg|thumbnail|left|Northwestern [[Las Condes]] from [[Gran Torre Santiago|Sky Costanera]] in 2018]]With the onset of the [[Chilean transition to democracy|transition to democracy]] in 1990, the city of Santiago surpassed four million inhabitants, with the majority residing in the south, particularly in La Florida, which was the most populous area, followed by Puente Alto and Maipú. The real estate development in these municipalities, as well as in others such as Quilicura and Peñalolén, was largely driven by the construction of housing projects for middle-class families. Meanwhile, high-income families relocated to the foothills, now commonly referred to as ''Barrio Alto'', boosting the population of Las Condes and giving rise to young communes, including [[Lo Barnechea]] and [[Vitacura]], both established in 1981 and 1991, respectively.

The area around [[Providencia Avenue]] became an important commercial hub in the eastern sector. This development extended to the ''Barrio Alto'', which became an attractive location for the construction of high-rise buildings. Major companies and financial corporations established themselves in the area, giving rise to a thriving modern business center commonly known as ''[[Sanhattan]]''. The departure of these companies to ''Barrio Alto'' and the construction of [[Shopping mall|shopping centers]] all around the city created a crisis in the city center. To reinvigorate the area, the government transformed the main shopping streets into pedestrian walkways, as it did in the 1970s, and offered tax benefits for the construction of residential buildings, which attracted young adults.

The city faced a series of problems due to disorganized growth. During the winter months, [[air pollution]] reached critical levels and a layer of [[smog]] blanketed the city. In response, the authorities implemented legislative measures to reduce industrial pollution and placed [[Road space rationing|restrictions]] on vehicle use. To address the problem of transportation, the metro system underwent significant expansion, with lines being extended and three new lines added between 1997 and 2006 in the southeastern sector. In 2011, a new extension was inaugurated in Maipú, bringing the total length of the metropolitan railway to {{Convert|105|km|abbr=on}}. In the early 1990s, the bus system also underwent a major reform. In 2007, the master plan known as [[Transantiago]] was established, although it has faced various challenges since its implementation.

[[File:Titanium La Portada (38888739395).jpg|thumbnail|[[Titanium La Portada]]]]
Entering the 21st century, rapid development continued in Santiago. The Civic District was revitalized with the creation of the [[Plaza de la Ciudadanía]] and the construction of the Ciudad Parque Bicentenario, which marked the [[Bicentennial of Chile|bicentenary]] of the Republic. The trend of constructing tall buildings continued in the eastern sector, which was highlighted by the opening of the [[Titanium La Portada]] and [[Gran Torre Santiago]] skyscrapers in the [[Costanera Center]] complex.

On 27 February 2010, a [[2010 Chile earthquake|powerful earthquake]] hit the capital city of Santiago, causing damage to some older buildings and rendering some modern structures uninhabitable. This sparked a heated discussion about the actual implementation of mandatory earthquake standards in the city's modern architecture.

Despite urban integration efforts, socioeconomic inequality and geosocial fragmentation remain two of the most important problems, both in the city and in the country. These problems have been considered one of the factors that led to the ''"[[Estallido Social]]"'', a series of massive protests and severe riots carried out between 2019 and 2020. The protests led to a serious civil confrontation, which led to thousands of arrests and accusations of human rights violations. Meanwhile, the demonstrations registered serious episodes of violence against public and private infrastructure, mainly in the surroundings of [[Plaza Baquedano]], with the [[Santiago Metro]] being one of the most affected by these episodes: more than half of its stations registered damage (several being partially set on fire) and only eleven months later the network returned to full normal service.

==Geography==
[[File:Satellite image of Santiago, Chile - October 24, 2014.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of Santiago taken by [[Landsat 8]] on 24 October 2014.]]

The city lies in the center of the ''Santiago Basin'', a large bowl-shaped valley consisting of broad and fertile lands surrounded by mountains. The city has a varying elevation, gradually increasing from {{cvt|400|m|0}} in the western areas to more than {{cvt|700|m|0}} in the eastern areas. Santiago's [[Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport|international airport]], in the west, lies at an altitude of {{cvt|460|m|0}}. [[Plaza Baquedano]], near the center, lies at {{cvt|570|m|0}}. [[Estadio San Carlos de Apoquindo]], at the eastern edge of the city, has an elevation of {{cvt|960|m|0}}.

The Santiago Basin is part of the [[Intermediate Depression]] and is remarkably flat, interrupted only by a few "island hills;" among them are [[Cerro Renca]], [[Cerro Blanco]], and [[Cerro Santa Lucía]]. The basin is approximately {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=off|sp=us}} in a north–south direction and {{cvt|35|km|0}} from east to west. The [[Mapocho River]] flows through the city.

The city is flanked by the main chain of the [[Andes]] to the east and the [[Chilean Coastal Range]] to the west. On the north, it is bordered by the ''Cordón de Chacabuco'', a mountain range of the Andes. At the southern border lies the ''Angostura de Paine'', an elongated spur of the Andes that almost reaches the coast.

The mountain range immediately bordering the city on the east is known as the [[Sierra de Ramón]], which was formed due to tectonic activity of the [[San Ramón Fault]]. This range reaches 3296 meters at [[Cerro de Ramón]]. The Sierra de Ramón represents the "[[Precordillera]]" of the Andes. {{cvt|20|km|0}} further east is the even larger Cordillera of the [[Andes]], which has mountains and volcanoes that exceed {{cvt|6000|m|-1}} and on which some glaciers are present. The tallest is the [[Tupungato]] mountain at {{cvt|6570|m|ft|0}}. Other mountains include [[Tupungatito]], [[San José (volcano)|San José]], and [[Maipo (volcano)|Maipo]]. [[Cerro El Plomo]] is the highest mountain visible from Santiago's urban area.

During recent decades, urban growth has outgrown the boundaries of the city, expanding to the east up the slopes of the Andean [[Precordillera]]. In areas such as La Dehesa, Lo Curro, and El Arrayan, urban development is present at over 1,000 meters of altitude.<ref name="Peaklist">{{Cite web |last=Peaklist |year=2007 |title=Argentina and Chile Central, Ultra-Prominences |url=http://www.peaklist.org/WWlists/ultras/andes2.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701202027/http://www.peaklist.org/WWlists/ultras/andes2.html |archive-date=1 July 2007 |access-date=24 June 2007}}</ref>

The natural vegetation of Santiago is made up of a [[Chilean matorral|thorny woodland]] of ''[[Vachellia caven]]'' (also known as ''Acacia caven'' and espinillo) and ''[[Prosopis chilensis]]'' in the west and an association of ''Vachellia caven'' and [[Baccharis paniculata]] in the east around the Andean foothills.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Luebert |first1=Federico |title=Sinopsis bioclimática y vegetacional de Chile |last2=Pliscoff |first2=Patricio |date=2017 |publisher=[[Editorial Universitaria]] |isbn=978-956-11-2575-9 |edition=2nd |location=Santiago de Chile |pages=130–132 |language=es |orig-year=2006}}</ref>

===Climate===
Santiago has a cool [[semi-arid climate]] (''BSk'' according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]), with [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] (''Csb'') patterns, while the eastern areas, being closer to the mountain range, have a true Mediterranean climate (Csb):<ref name="Clima 1 (Csb)">{{cite web|access-date=10 May 2024 |author=Gelcich |display-authors=et al |date=2020 |publisher=Boletín Agrometeorológico, Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias |title=Boletín Nacional de Análisis de Riesgos Agroclimáticos para las Principales Especies Frutales y Cultivos y la Ganadería (Introducción) |url=http://riesgoclimatico.inia.cl/public/boletines/eyJpdiI6ImgrcjVCelNWV1NBbExFZWVKcGt2bVE9PSIsInZhbHVlIjoiY3VSSmo2ZE4zNjBoNWFVTjNYSWRGdz09IiwibWFjIjoiZDEyODcyNzc2ZjQ4OWM5NDczZmQ5ODQ5MDcyNWIyNTU5NjA4MTRhMjQ2MmYyMzQ0M2IyZDQ5NzM3NGE2OGQ3ZSJ9 }}<!-- auto-translated from Spanish by Module:CS1 translator --></ref><ref name="Clima 2 (Csb)">{{cite web|access-date=10 May 2024 |publisher=Universidad Católica de Chile (UC) |title=Cartografía interactiva de los climas de Chile (seleccionar estaciones: Pudahuel, Quinta Normal y Los Cerrillos) |url=https://www7.uc.cl/sw_educ/geografia/cartografiainteractiva/Continental/Paginas/UntitledFrameset-1.htm}}<!-- auto-translated from Spanish by Module:CS1 translator --></ref> warm dry summers (October to March) with temperatures reaching up to {{cvt|35|°C|°F}} on the hottest days; winters (April to September) are cool with cool to cold mornings; typical daily maximum temperatures of {{cvt|14|°C|°F}}, and low temperatures near {{cvt|0|°C|°F}}.

In the airport area of Pudahuel, mean rainfall is {{cvt|276.9|mm|in|2}} per year, about 80% of which occurs during the winter months (May to September), varying between {{cvt|50|and|80|mm|2}} of rainfall during these months. That amount contrasts with a very sunny season during the summer months between December and March, when rainfall does not exceed {{cvt|4|mm|2}} on average, caused by an anticyclonic dominance continued for about seven or eight months. There is significant variation within the city, with rainfall at the lower-elevation Pudahuel site near the airport being about 20 percent lower than at the older Quinta Normal site near the city center.

Precipitation is usually only rain, as snowfall only occurs in the [[Andes]] and [[Precordillera]], being rare in eastern districts, and extremely rare in the central and western districts of the city.<ref name=snow/> In winter, the [[snow line]] is about {{convert|2100.|m|-1|sp=us}}, and it ranges from {{convert|1500.|-|2900.|m|sp=us}}.<ref name="snow">''René Garreaud-Salazar'' [http://www.dgf.uchile.cl/rene/PUBS/linea_nieve.pdf "Impacto en la variabilidad de la línea de nieve en crecidas invernales en cuencas pluvio-nivales de Chile central"] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323125024/http://www.dgf.uchile.cl/rene/PUBS/linea_nieve.pdf |date=23 March 2014 }}. {{in lang|es}} '''Sociedad Chilena de Ingeniería Hidráulica''', '''XI Congreso Chileno'''.

Temperatures vary throughout the year from an average of {{cvt|20|°C|0}} in January to {{cvt|8|°C|0}} in June and July.

Santiago's location within a watershed is one of the most important factors determining the climate of the city. The coastal mountain range serves as a screen that stops the spread of maritime influence, contributing to the increase in annual and daily thermal oscillation (the difference between the maximum and minimum daily temperatures can reach 14&nbsp;°C) and maintaining low relative humidity, close to an annual average of 70%. It also prevents the entry of air masses, with the exception of some coastal low clouds that penetrate to the basin through the river valleys.<ref>{{Cite web |title=How Does Air Movement Affect Weather? |url=https://sciencing.com/air-movement-affect-weather-8657368.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190129122852/https://sciencing.com/air-movement-affect-weather-8657368.html |archive-date=29 January 2019 |access-date=2019-01-29 |website=Sciencing |language=en}}</ref>

===Natural disasters===
Santiago is located on the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], where two tectonic plates, the [[Nazca Plate|Nazca]] and [[South American Plate]]s, collide. This results in a high frequency of earthquakes.<ref name="Buchenau, Jürgen 2009">Buchenau, Jürgen, and Lyman L. Johnson. ''Aftershocks: Earthquakes and Popular Politics in Latin America''. Albuquerque: U of New Mexico, 2009. Print.</ref> The first recorded earthquake to hit Santiago was in [[1575 Valdivia earthquake|1575]], just 34 years after its founding. The most devastating earthquake in the city's history took place in [[1647 Santiago earthquake|1647]], inspiring the novel ''[[The Earthquake In Chile]]'' by [[Heinrich von Kleist]].<ref name="Buchenau, Jürgen 2009" />

In response to the destructive earthquakes of [[1960 Valdivia earthquake|1960 (Valdivia)]] and [[1985 Algarrobo earthquake|1985 (Algarrobo)]], Santiago implemented strict building codes to minimize damage from future earthquakes. In 2010, Chile was hit by the sixth largest recorded [[2010 Chile earthquake|earthquake]] with a magnitude of 8.8 on the [[moment magnitude scale]]. The earthquake caused the death of 525 people, 13 of whom were in Santiago, and resulted in an estimated cost of 15–30&nbsp;billion US dollars. Although many homes were damaged, the stricter building codes prevented the scale of destruction seen in the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|Haiti earthquake]] of the same year, in which over 100,000 people lost their lives.<ref>Snook, Margaret.

==Demographics==
According to data collected in the 2002 census by the National Institute of Statistics, the Santiago metropolitan area population reached 5,428,590 inhabitants, equivalent to 35.9% of the national total and 89.6% of total regional inhabitants. This figure reflects broad growth in the population of the city during the 20th century: it had 383,587 inhabitants in 1907; 1,010,102 in 1940; 2,009,118 in 1960; 3,899,619 in 1982; and 4,729,118 in 1992.<ref name="santiagoine">Se consideran en total las comunas de la [[Santiago Province, Chile|Provincia de Santiago]], más [[Padre Hurtado]], [[Pirque]], [[Puente Alto]] y [[San Bernardo (Chile)|San Bernardo]].

[[File:Población de Santiago de Chile.svg|left|thumb|Population of Santiago from 1820 to 2020 (projected).]]
The growth of Santiago has undergone several changes over the course of its history. In its early years, the city had a rate of growth 2.9% annually until the 17th century, then down to less than 2% per year until the early 20th century figures. During the 20th century, Santiago experienced a demographic explosion as it absorbed migration from mining camps in northern Chile during the economic crisis of the 1930s. The population surged again via migration from rural sectors between 1940 and 1960. This migration was coupled with high fertility rates, and annual growth reached 4.9% between 1952 and 1960. Growth has declined, reaching 1.4% in the early 2000s. The size of the city expanded constantly; The 20,000 hectares Santiago covered in 1960 doubled by 1980, reaching 64,140 hectares in 2002. The population density in Santiago is 8,464 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>.

The population of Santiago<ref name=santiagoine/> has seen a steady increase in recent years. In 1990 the total population under 20 years was 38.0% and 8.9% were over 60. Estimates in 2007 show that 32.9% of men and 30.7% of women were less than 20 years old, while 10.2% of men and 13.4% of women were over 60 years. For the year 2020, it is estimated that the figures will be 26.7% and 16.8%.

4,313,719 people in Chile say they were born in one of the communes of the [[Santiago Metropolitan Region]],<ref name=santiagoine/> which, according to the 2002 census, amounts to 28.5% of the national total. 67.6% of the inhabitants of Santiago claim to have been born in one of the communes of the metropolitan area. In communes such as [[Santiago Centro]] and [[Independencia, Chile|Independencia]], according to 2017 census, 1/3 of residents is a Latin American immigrant (28% and 31% of the population of these communes, respectively).<ref name="Canal 13, 5 de mayo de 2018">[[Canal 13 (Chile)|Canal 13]]: [http://www.t13.cl/noticia/nacional/Censo-2017-28-de-habitantes-en-la-comuna-de-Santiago-son-inmigrantes Censo 2017: 28% de habitantes en la comuna de Santiago son inmigrantes] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190527071151/https://www.t13.cl/noticia/nacional/Censo-2017-28-de-habitantes-en-la-comuna-de-Santiago-son-inmigrantes |date=27 May 2019 }}.

Santiago's steady economic growth over the past few decades has transformed it into a modern metropolis. The city is now home to a growing theater and restaurant scene, extensive suburban development, dozens of shopping centers, and a rising skyline, including the second tallest building in Latin America, the [[Gran Torre Santiago]]. It includes several major universities, and has developed a modern transportation infrastructure, including a [[free flow]] toll-based, partly underground urban freeway system and the [[Metro de Santiago]], South America's most extensive subway system.

{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2024}}[[File:Metrolinea4.jpg|thumb|[[Vicente Valdés metro station|Vicente Valdés station]]]]
Santiago has 37% of Chile's vehicles, totaling 991,838, of which 979,346 are motorized. An extensive network of streets and avenues crisscrosses Santiago, facilitating travel between the different communities that make up the metropolitan area.

In the 1990s, the government attempted to reorganize the public transport system. New routes were introduced in 1994, and the buses were painted yellow. However, the system faced significant issues such as route overlaps, high levels of air and noise pollution, and safety concerns for both riders and drivers. To address these problems, a new transport system called [[Transantiago]] was devised. It was officially launched on February 10, 2007, combining core services across the city with the subway and local feeder routes, all under a unified payment system using a [[Contactless smart card|contactless smartcard]] called "Tarjeta bip!"

The change was not well received by users, who complained of a lack of buses, excessive transfers between buses, and reduced coverage. While some of these issues were eventually addressed, the system developed a poor reputation that it struggled to overcome. As of 2011, fare evasion remained persistently high.

In 2019, the government rebranded the public transport system as [[Red Metropolitana de Movilidad|RED]], aiming to distance it from the problematic Transantiago brand.

In recent years, many cycle paths have been constructed, but their number remains limited, and the routes are poorly connected. Most cyclists ride on the streets, and despite helmet and light use being mandatory, compliance is not widespread.[[File:Metro de Santiago.svg|thumb|left|Santiago Metro map as September, 2023]]

====Metro====
[[File:L6 Los Leones - Puertas de andén.jpg|thumb|220x220px|right|Los Leones station]]

[[Santiago Metro]] has seven operating lines (1, 2, 3, 4, 4A, 5 and 6), extending over {{cvt|149|km|0}} and connecting 143 stations. The system carries around 2,400,000 passengers per day.

{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2024}}[[File:Transantiago bus articulado.jpg|thumb|Transantiago bus, with original color scheme (2005–2012)]][[Red Metropolitana de Movilidad|Red]] (formerly known as Transantiago) is the name of Santiago's comprehensive public transportation system. It operates by integrating local feeder bus lines, main bus lines, EFE commuter trains, and the metro network. The system features an integrated fare system that enables passengers to make transfers between bus, metro, and train services using a single, contactless smartcard known as "Bip!". Additionally, it offers reduced fares for senior citizens, high school students, and university students.

====Vehicles for hire====
Taxicabs are prevalent in Santiago and are easily recognizable by their black bodies and yellow roofs, as well as their orange license plates. Another type of taxi called ''radiotaxis'' can be ordered by phone and can come in any make, model, or color, but must always have the orange license plates. ''Colectivos'' are shared taxis that follow a specific route and charge a fixed fee for the ride.

[[Cabify]], [[Uber]] and [[DiDi]] are also available in Santiago, though authorities warn they currently operate outside the law.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Villegas |first=Alejandro |date=2022-12-27 |title=Gobierno volvió a la carga con plan "anti Uber": han quitado más de 4.500 autos de aplicaciones |url=https://lahora.cl/cronica/2022/12/26/gobierno-volvio-a-la-carga-con-plan-anti-uber-han-quitado-mas-de-4-500-autos-de-aplicaciones/ |access-date=2023-02-12 |website=La Hora |language=es |archive-date=12 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230212103514/https://lahora.cl/cronica/2022/12/26/gobierno-volvio-a-la-carga-con-plan-anti-uber-han-quitado-mas-de-4-500-autos-de-aplicaciones/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Internal transport ===
[[File:Principales calles de Santiago.svg|thumbnail|left|Map of Santiago depicting main streets and [[Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport|airport]].]]
As of 2006, Santiago was home to 992,000 vehicles, 979,000 of which were motorized. This made up 37.3% of Chile's total vehicle count. 805,000 cars passed through the city, which is 37.6% of the national total{{Clarify|date=September 2016}} or one car for every seven people.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Marcela Sariego Rivera |last2=Rogelio Veloso Fiol |date=13 April 2007 |title=Anuario Parque de Vehículos en Circulación |url=http://www.ine.cl/canales/chile_estadistico/estadisticas_economicas/transporte_y_comunicaciones/pdf/parquevehiculosencirculacion2006.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620004747/http://www.ine.cl/canales/chile_estadistico/estadisticas_economicas/transporte_y_comunicaciones/pdf/parquevehiculosencirculacion2006.pdf |archive-date=20 June 2009 |access-date=11 December 2007 |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas |language=es}}</ref>

The main road is the [[Avenida Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins]], better known as Alameda Avenue, which runs northeast and southwest. From north to south, it is crossed by [[Autopista Central]] and the [[Independencia Avenue (Santiago de Chile)|Independencia]], [[Gran Avenida José Miguel Carrera|Gran Avenida]], [[Avenida Recoleta|Recoleta]], [[Avenida Santa Rosa|Santa Rosa]], [[Vicuña Mackenna Avenue|Vicuña Mackenna]] and [[Tobalaba Avenida|Tobalaba]] avenues. Other major roads include the [[Avenida Los Pajaritos]] to the west and [[Providencia Avenue]] and [[Apoquindo Avenue]] to the east. Finally, the [[Américo Vespucio Avenue]] acts as a [[ring road]].

During the 2000s, several urban highways were built through Santiago in order to improve the situation for vehicles. The road General Velásquez and sections of the [[Pan-American Highway]] in Santiago were converted into the Autopista Central, while Américo Vespucio became variously the highways Vespucio Norte Express and Vespucio Sur, as well as Vespucio Oriente in the future. Following the edge of the Mapocho River, Costanera Norte was built to link the northeast of the capital to the airport and the downtown area. All these highways, totaling 210&nbsp;km in length, have a free flow toll system.

==Administrative divisions==
[[File:Edificio de la Municipalidad de Santiago 20220619 01.jpg|thumb|City Hall of Santiago]]
Greater Santiago lacks a metropolitan government for its administration, which is distributed between authorities, complicating the operation of the city as a single entity.<ref>Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (2004), Boletín de Políticas Públicas: ''[http://www.puc.cl/icp/webcp/papers/boletin_santiago.pdf Una autoridad metropolitana para Santiago]'' {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The highest authorities in Santiago are considered to be the [[governor of the Santiago Metropolitan Region]], who is [[Regional Governor (Chile)|popularly elected to the office]], now held by [[Claudio Orrego]], and the regional presidential delegate of Santiago Metropolitan Region, an official appointed by the president of Chile.

The conurbation of Greater Santiago does not fit perfectly into any administrative division, as it extends into four different [[Provinces of Chile|provinces]] and 35 [[Communes of Chile|communes]] plus 11 [[Satellite city|satellite communes]] which together make the Santiago Metropolitan Area. The majority of its {{cvt|641.4|km²|2}} (as of 2002)<ref name="galetovic">{{Cite web |last=Alexander Galetovic; Pablo Jordán |date=Summer 2008 |title=Santiago: ¿Dónde estamos?, ¿Hacia dónde vamos? |url=http://www.cepchile.cl/dms/archivo_3739_1932/r101_galetovic_santiago.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002030521/http://www.cepchile.cl/dms/archivo_3739_1932/r101_galetovic_santiago.pdf |archive-date=2 October 2008 |access-date=17 September 2008 |publisher=Estudios Públicos |language=es}}</ref> lie within [[Santiago Province, Chile|Santiago Province]], with some peripheral areas contained in the provinces of [[Cordillera Province, Chile|Cordillera]], [[Maipo Province|Maipo]], and [[Talagante Province|Talagante]].

Although there is no official consensus in this regard, the communes of the city are usually grouped into seven sectors: [[North zone of Santiago de Chile|north]], [[Santiago (commune)|center]], [[Northeastern zone of Santiago de Chile|northeast]], [[Southeastern zone of Santiago de Chile|southeast]], [[South zone of Santiago de Chile|south]], [[Northwestern zone of Santiago de Chile|southeast]] and [[Southwestern zone of Santiago de Chile|southwest]].

Only a few historical buildings from the Spanish colonial period remain in the city, because – like the rest of the country – Santiago is regularly hit by earthquakes. Extant buildings include the [[Casa Colorada]] (1769), the [[San Francisco Church, Santiago de Chile|San Francisco Church]] (1586), and [[Posada del Corregidor]] (1750).

The cathedral on the central square ([[Plaza de Armas (Santiago)|Plaza de Armas]]) is a sight that ranks as high as the Palacio de La Moneda, the Presidential Palace. The original building was built between 1784 and 1805, and architect Joaquín Toesca was in charge of its construction. Other buildings surrounding the Plaza de Armas are the [[Central Post Office Building (Santiago)|Central Post Office Building]], which was finished in 1882, and the [[Palacio de la Real Audiencia de Santiago]], built between 1804 and 1807. It houses the [[Chilean National History Museum]], with 12,000 objects that can be exhibited. On the southeast corner of the square stands the green cast-iron Commercial Edwards building, which was built in 1893. East of that is the colonial building of the [[Casa Colorada]] (1769), which houses the Museum of Santiago. Close by is the [[Municipal Theatre of Santiago]], which was built in 1857 by the French architect Brunet of Edward Baines. It was badly damaged by an earthquake in 1906. Not far from the theater is the Subercaseaux Mansion and the [[Biblioteca Nacional de Chile|National Library]], one of the largest libraries of South America.

The [[Former National Congress Building]], the [[Palacio de los Tribunales de Justicia de Santiago|Justice Palace]], and the Royal Customs Palace (''Palacio de la Real Aduana de Santiago'') are located close to each other. The latter houses the [[Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino|Museum of pre-Columbian art]]. A fire destroyed the building of the Congress in 1895, which was then rebuilt in a neoclassical style and reopened in 1901. The Congress was deposed under the military dictatorship (1973–89) of [[Augusto Pinochet]], and after the dictatorship was newly constituted on 11 March 1990, in Valparaíso.

The building of the Justice Palace (Palacio de Tribunales) is located on the south side of the Montt Square. It was designed by the architect Emilio Doyére and built between 1907 and 1926. The building is home to the [[Supreme Court of Chile]]. The panel of 21 judges is the highest judicial power in Chile. The building is also the headquarters of the Court of Appeals of Santiago.

Bandera street leads toward the building of the [[Santiago Stock Exchange]] (the ''Bolsa de Comercio''), completed in 1917, the [[Club de la Unión (Chile)|Club de la Unión]] (opened in 1925), the Universidad de Chile (1872), and toward the oldest churchhouse in the city, the San Francisco Church (constructed between 1586 and 1628), with its Marian statue of the ''Virgen del Socorro'' ("Our Lady of Help"), which was brought to Chile by Pedro de Valdivia. North of the ''Plaza de Armas'' ("Square of Arms", where the colonial militia was mustered) are the [[Paseo Puente]], the [[Santo Domingo Church, Santiago de Chile|Santo Domingo Church]] (1771), and the [[Mercado Central de Santiago|Central Market]] (Mercado Central), an ornamental iron building. Also in downtown Santiago is the [[Torre Entel]], a 127.4-meter-high television tower with observation deck completed in 1974; the tower serves as a communication center for the communications company, ENTEL Chile.

The Costanera Center was completed in 2009, and includes housing, shopping, and entertainment venues. The project, with a total area of 600,000 square meters, includes the 300-meter high [[Gran Torre Santiago]] (South America's tallest building) and other commercial buildings. The four office towers are served by highway and subway connections.<ref>Emporis: {{usurped|1=[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930133548/http://www.emporis.com/ge/wm/bu/?id=grantorrecostanera-santiago-chile Gran Torre Costanera]}}</ref>

=== Heritage and monuments ===
[[File:Catedral Metropolitana de Santiago 2012-09-01 10-05-15.jpg|thumbnail|right|The [[Santiago Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]], built between 1748 and 1906|250px]]

Within the metropolitan area of Santiago, there are 174 [[National Monuments of Chile|heritage sites]] in the custody of the National Monuments Council, among which are archeological, architectural and historical monuments, neighborhoods and typical areas. Of these, 93 are located within the [[Santiago (commune)|commune of Santiago]], considered the historic center of the city. Although no santiaguino monument has been declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[Unesco]] three have already been proposed by the Chilean government: the Incan sanctuary of [[Cerro El Plomo|El Plomo]], [[San Francisco Church, Santiago de Chile|the church and convent of San Francisco]] and the [[palace of La Moneda]].

In the center of Santiago are several buildings built during the Spanish domination and that mostly correspond to, as the [[Santiago Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]] and the aforementioned church of San Francisco Catholic churches. Buildings of the period are those located on the sides of [[Plaza de Armas (Santiago)|Plaza de Armas]], as the seat of [[Palacio de la Real Audiencia de Santiago|Real Audiencia]], the [[Central Post Office Building (Santiago)|Post Office]] or the [[Casa Colorada]].

During the nineteenth century and the advent of independence, new architectural works began to be erected in the capital of the young republic. The aristocracy built small palaces for residential use, mainly around the neighborhood Republica and preserved until today. To this other structures adopted artistic trends from Europe, as the [[Club Hípico de Santiago|Equestrian Club of Santiago]], the head offices of the [[University of Chile]] and the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile|Catholic University]], [[Estación Central (railway station)|Central Station]] and the [[Estación Mapocho|Mapocho Station]], [[Mercado Central de Santiago|Mercado Central]], join the [[Biblioteca Nacional de Chile|National Library]], [[Chilean National Museum of Fine Arts|Museum of Fine Arts]] and the [[Barrio París-Londres]], among others.

Various green areas in the city contain within and around various sites of heritage character. Among the most important are the fortifications of [[Santa Lucía Hill|Santa Lucia hill]], the [[Sanctuary on San Cristóbal Hill|shrine of the Virgin Mary]] on the summit of [[San Cristóbal Hill|San Cristobal hill]], the lavish crypt of the [[Cementerio General de Santiago|General Cemetery]], [[Parque Forestal]], the [[O'Higgins Park]] and the [[Quinta Normal Park]].

=== Cultural activities and entertainment ===
[[File:Museo Colonial - Santiago.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Museo Colonial|Museo de Arte Colonial de San Francisco]].]]
[[File:Centro Gabriela Mistral-002.jpg|thumbnail|Interior from [[Centro Cultural Gabriela Mistral|Gabriela Mistral Cultural Center]].]]
In Santiago's major [[theater]] companies are located, hosting several national and international projects, with the highest expression during the International Theatre Festival known as [[Santiago a Mil International Theater Festival|Santiago a Mil]], which takes place every January since 1994 and has gathered more than one million spectators. Also is the Planetarium at the [[University of Santiago de Chile]].

To carry out various cultural, artistic and musical events, there are several precincts within which highlight the [[Estación Mapocho|Mapocho Cultural Center]], [[Centro Cultural Matucana 100|100 Matucana Cultural Center]], the [[Centro Cultural Gabriela Mistral|Gabriela Mistral Cultural Center]], [[Centro Cultural Palacio de La Moneda]], the [[Movistar Arena (Santiago)|Movistar Arena]] and the [[Teatro Caupolicán|Caupolican Theater]]. On the other hand, the [[opera]] and [[ballet]] performances are permanently accepted by the [[Municipal Theatre of Santiago]], located in the heart of the city and which has a capacity of 1500 spectators.

There are 18 cinemas in the capital with a total of 144 rooms and over 32,000 seats, the projection centers than 5 arthouse add.

For children and teenagers, there are several entertainment venues, such as amusement park [[Fantasilandia]], the [[Chilean National Zoo|National Zoo]] or the [[Buin Zoo]] on the outskirts of the city. The [[Barrio Bellavista|Bellavista]], [[Barrio Brasil|Brasil]], [[Barrio Manuel Montt|Manuel Montt]], [[Plaza Ñuñoa]] and [[Barrio Suecia|Suecia]] account for most of the nightclubs, restaurants and bars in the city, the main evening entertainment centers in the capital. In order to promote the economic development of other regions, the law prohibits the construction of a casino in the metropolitan region, but nearby are the casino from the coastal city of [[Vina del Mar]], 120&nbsp;km from distance from Santiago, and [[Monticello Grand Casino]] in Mostazal, 56 kilometers south of Santiago, which opened in 2008.

=== Museums and libraries ===
Santiago has a wealth of [[museum]]s of different kinds, among which are three of 'National' class administered by the [[Directorate of Libraries, Archives and Museums]] (DIBAM): the [[National History Museum (Santiago, Chile)|National History Museum]], [[Chilean National Museum of Fine Arts|National Museum of Fine Arts]] and the [[Chilean National Museum of Natural History|National Museum of Natural History]].

Most of the museums are located in the historic city center, occupying the old buildings of colonial origin, such as with the National History Museum, which is located in the [[Palacio de la Real Audiencia de Santiago|Palacio de la Real Audiencia]]. La [[Casa Colorada]] houses the Museum of Santiago, while the Colonial Museum is housed in a wing of the [[San Francisco Church, Santiago de Chile|Church of San Francisco]] and the [[Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino|Museum of Pre-Columbian Art]] occupies part of the old [[Palacio de la Real Aduana de Santiago|Palacio de la Aduana]]. The Museum of Fine Arts, though it is located in the city center, was built in the early twentieth century, especially for housing the museum and in the back of the building was laid in 1947, the [[Santiago Museum of Contemporary Art|Museum of Contemporary Art]], under the [[Faculty of Arts of the University of Chile]].

[[Quinta Normal Park]] also has several museums, among which are the already mentioned Natural History, [[Artequin Museum]], the [[Museum of Science and Technology, Santiago|Museum of Science and Technology]], and the [[Museo Ferroviario]]. In 2010, the [[Museum of Memory and Human Rights]] was inaugurated, which commemorates the victims of human rights violations committed during the country's military dictatorship.

In other parts of the city there are some museums such as the [[Museo Nacional Aeronáutico y del Espacio|Aeronautical Museum]] in Cerrillos, [[Tajamares del Mapocho|Museum of Tajamares]] in Providence and the [[Museo Interactivo Mirador]] in La Granja. The latter opened in 2000 and designed mainly for children and youth has been visited by more than 2.8&nbsp;million visitors, making it the busiest museum in the country.

The most important public library is the [[Biblioteca Nacional de Chile|National Library]] located in downtown Santiago. Its origins date back to 1813, when it was created by the nascent Republic and was moved to its current premises a century later, also home to the headquarters of the [[National Archives of Chile|National Archives]]. In order to provide more closeness to the population, incorporating new technologies and complement the services provided by public libraries and the National Library was opened in 2005 the [[Library of Santiago]] at [[Barrio Matucana]].

==Education==
The city is home to numerous universities, colleges, research institutions, and libraries.

The largest university and one of the oldest in the [[Americas]] is [[Universidad de Chile]]. The roots of the university date back to the year 1622, as on 19 August the first university in Chile under the name of Santo Tomás de Aquino was founded. On 28 July 1738, it was named the Real Universidad de [[Philip the Apostle|San Felipe]] in honor of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. In the vernacular, it is also known as Casa de Bello (Spanish: House of Bello – after their first Rector, [[Andrés Bello]]). On 17 April 1839, after Chile's independence from the [[Kingdom of Spain]], it was renamed the Universidad de Chile, and reopened on 17 September 1843.<ref>[http://www.historia.uchile.cl/CDA/fh_article/0,1389,SCID%253D11760%2526ISID%253D489%2526PRT%253D11759%2526JNID%253D12,00.html Fuentes documentales y bibliográficas para el estudio de la historia de Chile.

It received recognition by the Chilean government as an appointed Pontifical University in 1931. [[Joaquín Larraín Gandarillas]] (1822–1897), [[Archbishop of Anazarba]], was the founder and first rector of the PUC. The PUC is a modern university; the campus of San Joaquin has a number of contemporary buildings and offers many parks and sports facilities. Several courses are conducted in English.
