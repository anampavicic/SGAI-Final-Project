'''Ipoh''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|p|oʊ}}, {{IPA-ms|i.poh}}) is the capital city of the [[Malaysia]]n [[States and federal territories of Malaysia|state]] of [[Perak]]. Located by the [[Kinta River]], it is nearly {{Convert|200|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Kuala Lumpur]] and {{Convert|150|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[George Town, Penang|George Town]] in neighbouring [[Penang]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ipoh, city in Malaysia {{!}} Wonderful Malaysia |url=https://www.wonderfulmalaysia.com/ipoh-city-malaysia.htm |access-date=2023-03-23 |website=www.wonderfulmalaysia.com}}</ref> As of the [[Census in Malaysia|2020 census]] Ipoh had a population of 759,952, making it the [[List of cities in Malaysia by population|eighth-largest city in Malaysia by population]].

In recent years, Ipoh's popularity as an international tourist destination has been significantly boosted by efforts to conserve its [[British Empire|British]] colonial-era architecture.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /> The city is also well known for its [[Ipoh cuisine|cuisine]] and natural attractions, such as its limestone hills and caves within which Buddhist temples were built.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipohecho.com.my/v4/article/2015/05/16/caves-of-the-kinta-valley|title=Ipoh Echo {{!}} Caves of the Kinta Valley|last=net|first=powered by iosc dot|website=IpohEcho.com.my|date=16 May 2015 |language=en|access-date=2017-08-21}}</ref>

Ipoh's location between [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[George Town, Penang|George Town]] has made it a major land transportation hub within [[Peninsular Malaysia|West Malaysia]], with both the [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu|Malayan Railway]]'s [[KTM West Coast Railway Line|West Coast Line]] and the [[North–South Expressway (Malaysia)|North-South Expressway]] cutting through the city. Aside from the land transportation links, Ipoh is also served by the [[Sultan Azlan Shah Airport]].

==Etymology==
The name Ipoh is derived from a local tree, ''pohon epu'', now more commonly known as [[Upas Tree|''pokok ipoh'']]. The sap of this plant is poisonous and was used by [[Orang Asli|local indigenous people]] mixed with [[Strychnos]] latex to coat the tips of their blowpipe darts for hunting.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ng |first1=Francis |title=Ipoh's terrible tree |url=https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2012/01/07/ipohs-terrible-tree/ |access-date=29 January 2022 |work=The Star |language=en}}</ref>

==History==

Originally a village, Ipoh began to grow rapidly in the 1880s after huge deposits of [[tin]] were discovered within its vicinity.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://db.ipohworld.org/photo/pdf/3875_wzhem140612.pdf|title=The History of Ipoh}}</ref> Its geographic location in the rich tin-bearing valley of the [[Kinta River]] made it a natural centre of growth.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Choong |first1=C.M. |last2=Sautter |first2=B. |last3=Pubellier |first3=M. |last4=Menier |first4=D. |last5=Chow |first5=W.S |last6=Kadir |first6=A.A. |date=December 2014 |title=Geological Features of the Kinta Valley |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283622669 |journal=Platform: A Journal of Engineering, Science and Society |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=1–14}}</ref>

The Great Fire of Ipoh in 1892 destroyed over half the town, but also presented an opportunity to rebuild the town in a more orderly grid pattern.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Surana |first=Sanjay |date=2018-02-28 |title=Why Ipoh, Malaysia, Should Be on Your Travel Radar |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/travel/ipoh-malaysia-tourism.html |access-date=2024-05-11 |work=The New York Times |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> By 1895, it was the second largest town within the [[Federated Malay States]], which also consisted of [[Selangor]], [[Negeri Sembilan]], and [[Pahang]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbi.gov.my/ms/pelawat/info-ipoh/page/0/1|title=Info Ipoh: Halaman 2 dari 2 {{!}} Portal Rasmi Majlis Bandaraya Ipoh (MBI)|website=mbi.gov.my|access-date=2017-08-21|archive-date=21 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200921122218/http://www.mbi.gov.my/ms/pelawat/info-ipoh/page/0/1|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Ipoh was subsequently rebuilt in time for the second tin rush and grew rapidly as a result of the booming tin mining industry, particularly in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-12-03 |title=Discover the Lost World of Tambun |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/partner-content-rediscovering-a-lost-world |access-date=2024-05-11 |website=National Geographic |language=en}}</ref>

A local [[Hakka people|Hakka]] miner, millionaire Yau Tet Shin, started developing a large tract of the town in the early 1930s, today known as the "New Town", from the eastern bank of the [[Kinta River]] to Greentown.<ref name="ipohworld762">[http://www.ipohworld.org/blog/?p=762 Ipohworld’s World » Yau Tet Shin’s New Town Under Construction 1908].

[[File:IPOH TOWN.png|thumb|Map of Ipoh, Perak in 1951]]

Ipoh was invaded by the Japanese on 15 December 1941. In March 1942, the Japanese Civil Administration or Perak Shu Seicho was set up at [[St. Michael's Institution]]. After the liberation of Malaya by British forces, Ipoh remained the capital of Perak as it does to this day.<ref>Khoo Salma Nasution & Abdur-Razzaq Lubis, ''Kinta Valley: Pioneering Malaysia's Modern Development'', Ipoh: Perak Academy, 2005. pp. 273–292</ref>

===Topography===
Ipoh is in the state of [[Perak]], which is in the central part of [[Peninsular Malaysia]]. The city is in the middle of the [[karstic]] [[Kinta Valley]] region, on the bank of the [[Kinta River]] and the confluence of the smaller rivers Sungai Pinji and Sungai Pari. Hills of [[limestone]], called [[mogote]]s, surround the city, which can be found around suburban areas to the northeast, east and southeast.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.malaysiahotelreview.com/perak/destination/limestone-hill.shtml |title=Limestone Hills (Bukit Batu Kapur), Ipoh, PERAK – Malaysia Travel Review |publisher=Malaysiahotelreview.com |access-date=10 December 2013 |archive-date=20 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220232704/http://malaysiahotelreview.com/perak/destination/limestone-hill.shtml |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The [[Keledang Range|Keledang mountain range]] stretches from the north to the west of the city.

===Limestone caves===
[[Mogote]]s are the most prominent natural features of the city. There are many caves in these outcrops, some of which have cave temples built in them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cavesofmalaysia.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060706051626/http://www.cavesofmalaysia.com/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 July 2006 |title=Home |publisher=Cavesofmalaysia.com |access-date=10 December 2013 }}</ref> The [[Sam Poh Tong Temple]]  is a notable example, along with Kek Lok Tong; Cavern of Utmost Happiness), which lies on the other side of the same outcrop. It is accessible through the Gunung Rapat housing area. Other cave temples in Ipoh include Ling Sen Tong, Nan Tian Tong, Kwan Yin Tong and Perak Tong.

[[Gua Tempurung]], near [[Gopeng]], south of Ipoh, is a show cave open to the public and popular among [[Caving|spelunkers]]. More than {{Convert|3|km|abbr=on}} long, it is one of the longest caves in Peninsular Malaysia. Part of it has been developed with electric lighting and walkways, and there are tours of varying lengths and difficulty. A river passage runs about {{Convert|1.6|km|abbr=on}} through the hill. There are five large chambers, filled with spectacular [[speleothems]] which include [[stalactites]] and [[stalagmites]].

==Transport==
[[File:Sultan Azlan Shah Airport.JPG|thumb|[[Sultan Azlan Shah Airport]]]]

===Roads===
The old interstate [[Malaysia Federal Route 1|Federal Route 1]] connects Ipoh with other major towns and cities in peninsular Malaysia, for example to [[Alor Setar]], [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]] and [[Penang]] to the north and [[Tapah]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Seremban]] and even [[Johor Bahru]] in the south. Motorists from the east coast can use [[Malaysia Federal Route 4|Federal Route 4]] (from [[Gerik]]) in northern Perak or [[Malaysia Federal Route 185|Federal Route 185]] (from [[Cameron Highlands]]).

The new [[North–South Expressway (Malaysia)|North–South Expressway]] is a faster and more efficient alternative to Route 1. However, some towns such as [[Kampar, Perak|Kampar]] can only be accessible via Route 1.

===Train===
[[Ipoh railway station|Ipoh's railway station]] is operated by [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu]] (KTM) and is in the Old Town. However, it does not have intra-city travel like there is in [[Kuala Lumpur]]; the railway only connects Ipoh with neighbouring towns and cities. The station is a stately building, referred to by locals as the "Taj Mahal of Ipoh". [[KTM Intercity]] began the Shuttle Train Service between Kuala Lumpur and Ipoh from 1 December 2008 while the modern [[KTM ETS|Electric Train System (ETS)]] shuttle began from 12 August 2010, with an average speed of {{Convert|145|km/h|abbr=on}}, plying the Ipoh-Seremban route, which cut the travelling distance between Ipoh and Kuala Lumpur to 120&nbsp;minutes. There are 10 dedicated shuttle train services between these two cities daily, beginning at 5&nbsp;am from both of the stations. Travel time between the cities was expected to be reduced from three hours to two hours and fifteen minutes when the new set of EMU trains arrived in mid-2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cockatoo.com/malaysia/e-06pera/em-per27.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130119155613/http://www.cockatoo.com/malaysia/e-06pera/em-per27.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 January 2013 |title=Malaysia / Perak / The Ipoh Railway Station |publisher=Cockatoo.com |date=14 November 2011 |access-date=10 December 2013 }}</ref>
