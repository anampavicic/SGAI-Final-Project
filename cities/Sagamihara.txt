==History==
The area of modern Sagamihara has been settled since ancient times, and has a number of remains from the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period and [[Kofun period]] have been found. It was home to the Yokoyama clan, one of the seven warrior clans of the [[Musashi Province|Musashi region]] during the early [[Kamakura period]]. During the [[Edo period]], the lands around Sagamihara were ''[[tenryō]]'' territory theoretically administered directly by the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]] in [[Edo]]; however, in reality, the area was a patchwork of small fiefs held by various ''[[hatamoto]]'', as well as exclaves under the control of the Ogino-Yamanaka Domain and Karasuyama Domain.

After the [[Meiji Restoration]], the eastern portion was part of [[Kōza District, Kanagawa|Kōza District]], and the western portion was part of [[Tsukui District, Kanagawa|Tsukui District]]. The Kōza District portion was administratively divided into six villages on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. The area was the location of extensive training facilities and arsenals of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] during the 1930s. These villages were merged on April 29, 1941, together with neighboring [[Zama, Kanagawa|Zama Town]] to create Sagamihara Town. At the time of its formation, it was the largest town in Japan in terms of area.

On September 1, 1948, Zama was administratively separated into Zama Town. The remaining portion became Sagamihara City on November 20, 1954. The city population had grown steadily, partly due to local industrial development, and partly due to the city's excellent transportation infrastructure connecting it to [[Yokohama]], Tokyo and [[Hachiōji, Tokyo|Hachiōji]]. It was designated a [[Core cities of Japan|core city]] with increased autonomy in 2003.

On March 20, 2006, Sagamihara absorbed the towns of [[Tsukui, Kanagawa|Tsukui]] and [[Sagamiko, Kanagawa|Sagamiko]] (both from [[Tsukui District, Kanagawa|Tsukui District]]). The merged city consisted of two geographically separate areas, as two other towns of Tsukui District ([[Fujino, Kanagawa|Fujino]] and [[Shiroyama, Kanagawa|Shiroyama]]) elected to remain separate. A further merger on March 11, 2007, joined Fujino and Shiroyama with Sagamihara, thus geographically unifying the city, and dissolving former Tsukui District. In 2007, the population of Sagamihara exceeded 700,000. In 2010, Sagamihara was redesignated as a [[Cities designated by government ordinance of Japan|government ordinance city]] and split into three wards Midori-ku, Chūō-ku, and Minami-ku.

On July 25, 2016, 19 people were killed and 26 injured in [[Sagamihara stabbings|a mass stabbing incident]] at a disabled care home in the city by Satoshi Uematsu, the perpetrator.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McCurry|first1=Justin|title=Japan Knife Attack: Stabbing at Care Centre Leaves 19 Dead and Dozens Wounded|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/25/tokyo-knife-attack-stabbing-sagamihara|access-date=July 26, 2016|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media|date=July 26, 2016}}</ref>

==Government==
Sagamihara has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 49 members. Sagamihara contributes eight members to the Kanagawa Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between the Kanagawa 14th district and Kanagawa 16th district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
In terms of economy and geography such as railroads and roads, Sagamihara has stronger ties with Tokyo than other cities in the prefecture, especially with the Tama area such as Machida and Hachioji. In addition, it is positioned by the national government as the core of the southwestern part of the Tokyo metropolitan area. However, due to the successive withdrawal of large factories in the city, the aspect of Sagimahara as a [[commuter town]] has become stronger, and the percentage of commuters to work and school in Tokyo in 2015 was 24.6%.

==Education==
*[[Azabu University]]
*[[Izumi Junior College]]
*[[Sagami Women's University]]
* Sagamihara has 13 public high schools and one combined middle/high school operated by the Kanagawa Prefectural Board of Education, and the prefecture also operates two special education schools for the handicapped. There are also two private high schools.
