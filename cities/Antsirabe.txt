'''Antsirabe''' ({{IPA-mg|anˌtsiraˈbe}}) is the [[list of cities in Madagascar|third largest city]] in [[Madagascar]] and the capital of the [[Vakinankaratra]] region, with a population of 265,018 in 2014.
In Madagascar, Antsirabe is known for its relatively cool climate (like the rest of the central region), its industry and the high concentration of [[pulled rickshaw]]s or ''pousse-pousse''. It attracts around 30,000 tourists a year.

== Etymology and names ==
The [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] name ''Antsirabe'' literally means "the place of much salt".

The city has the nicknames ''ville d'eau'' ('city of water' in French) and ''visy gasy'' or ''le Vichy malgache'' ('the Malagasy [[Vichy]]' in [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] and French respectively), referring to the presence of multiple [[thermal spring]]s in the area.<ref name="voyage">{{cite web|url=http://fr.travel2mada.com/villes/antsirabe.xhtml|title=Votre voyage à Antsirabe à Madagascar [Your trip to Antsirabe in Madagascar]|publisher=MTTC|access-date=14 July 2012|language=fr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111035607/http://fr.travel2mada.com/villes/antsirabe.xhtml|archive-date=11 November 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

== History ==
The area where Antsirabe is found today was part of the Kingdom of [[Andrantsay]] which existed from the early 1600s until it was incorporated into the [[Imerina]] kingdom in the early 1800s. The area was a farming region, with production of rice, vegetables and fruit.<ref name = hist>{{Cite web | last = Misy Info | title = Site communautaire d'information touristique: Un peu d'histoire | url = http://www.madagascar-antsirabe.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=189:un-peu-dhistoire&catid=94:patrimoine&Itemid=270 | access-date = 23 December 2011 | archive-date = 26 April 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120426085844/http://www.madagascar-antsirabe.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=189:un-peu-dhistoire&catid=94:patrimoine&Itemid=270 | url-status = live }}</ref>

The first Norwegian (Lutheran) missionaries arrived in 1868. [[Limestone]] and [[sulphur]] were exploited in the area at this time.<ref name="hist"/>

The city was founded by Norwegian missionary T.G. Rosaas in 1872 as a hill station to serve as a retreat centre because of the much cooler climate. The thermal baths were opened in 1917.

In 1886 the Norwegian mission established the [[Leprosy|leper]] hospital of [[Ambohipiantrana]] and it quickly developed into a village for lepers. The colonial government decided to make it the leper hospital of Vakinankaratra and the around 950 people with the illness lived there in 1904.<ref name="hist"/>

During the [[History of Madagascar#French colonization|French colonial rule]] the centre of the [[Vakinankaratra]] region shifted from the Andrantsay capital of [[Fivavahana]] to Antsirabe.

In 1921 it succeeded [[Betafo]] as the seat of a Catholic (pre-diocesan) [[Apostolic vicariate]], and was promoted to a bishopric in 1955.

== Population ==
=== Languages ===
The majority of the population belongs to the [[Merina people|Merina]] ethnic group, which speaks a highland dialect of [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]]. As in other urban areas of Madagascar, French is widely understood.

== Places of worship ==  
[[Image:Antsirabe - église.JPG|thumb|[[Our Lady of La Salette Cathedral, Antsirabe|Our Lady of La Salette Cathedral]]]]
The [[places of worship]], are predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and temples:
*[[Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar]] 
*[[Malagasy Lutheran Church]] 
*[[Assemblies of God]]
*[[Association of Bible Baptist Churches in Madagascar]]
*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Antsirabe]]

There are also [[Islam|Muslim]] mosques.

== Architecture ==
[[Image:Antsirabe - hôtel des Thermes.JPG|thumb|Hôtel des Thermes]]
Several buildings in central Antsirabe date back to the first decades of the 20th century. These include the thermal bath centre (opened in 1917), Hôtel des Thermes (1922), the railway station (1923), and the residence for French retirees (1934).

Other sights are ''la Stèle de l'Indépendance'' (the [[Stele]] of Independence) on Independence Avenue and the two public markets: Antsenakely ("The Small Market") and the bigger Asabotsy.

An [[Export Processing Zone]] is located in Antsirabe and the town is the home of several factories, including Star Brasseries (beverages), Cotona (textiles) and Kobama (grain).

Antsirabe is also the major apple producing town of Madagascar, with some 10,000 tons produced per year.<ref>[https://www.lexpress.mg/2024/01/industrialisation-la-vitesse-de-pointe.html l'Express: Industrialisation: la vitesse de pointe]</ref>

[[Image:Antsirabe station.jpg|thumb|right|Train station]]
The city is at the end of the TA (Tananarive-Antsirabe) railway line, part of the Network North railway, which links Antsirabe to the capital and the port city of [[Toamasina]]. The line is operated by [[Madarail]], currently only with freight trains. The line has been extended southwards through [[Vinaninkarena]], but this extension is not in use.

[[Route nationale 7 (Madagascar)|National road 7 (RN7)]] connects the city to [[Antananarivo]] in the north and to [[Fianarantsoa]] and [[Toliara]] to the south. Antsirabe is connected with [[Morondava]] on the west coast through [[Route nationale 34 (Madagascar)|RN34]] and [[Route nationale 35 (Madagascar)|RN 35]].

Public transport to and from Antsirabe are provided by [[taxi-brousse]]s (share taxis) and buses.
