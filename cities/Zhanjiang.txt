==History==
===Imperial China era===
During the [[Qin dynasty]] (221–206&nbsp;BC), the area belonged to Xiang Shire. The imperial government of the [[Han dynasty]] (206&nbsp;BC−220&nbsp;AD) set Xuwen County as the administrator of the whole [[Leizhou Peninsula]]. It was one of the earliest departure points on the [[Maritime Silk Road]]. It was a city port soon after.
Great numbers of Putian colonists settled in the Leizhou peninsula, establishing colonies during the Song empire. They soon formed the Leizhou peninsula's linguistic and ethnic majority, while others like the Baiyue, Cantonese, Tanka, foreigners lived on the coast of the peninsula.

===French leased territory===
{{Further|Guangzhouwan}}
The region served as a small fishing port when it was occupied by the French in 1898. The next year, the French forced the Chinese to lease a small enclave of Zhanjiang to them for 99 years (until 1997), as the [[British Empire]] did in Hong Kong's New Territories and as the Germans did in the Kiautschou Bay Leased Territory, as the territory of [[Guangzhouwan|'''Kouang-Tchéou-Wan''']]. The local population fled before the arrival of the French, so upon French invitation, [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] peasants from north of Leizhou came to repopulate the empty French possession, thus the local language of communication was changed to [[Yue Chinese]]. The French wanted to develop the port, which they called '''Fort-Bayard''', to serve southern China, in parts where France had exclusive rights to railway and mineral development. Their efforts, however, were hindered by the poverty of the surrounding land. The French controlled the small enclave until 1943, when the Japanese occupied the area during [[World War II]]. At the end of the war, the enclave was briefly ceded to the French before being formally returned to China in 1946 by General [[Charles de Gaulle]], then the French head of state.

===Return to China===
Upon recovering the territory from the French, the Republic of China government decided to rename Kouang-Tchéou-Wan. The area was historically under the jurisdiction of Zhanchuan county, with a Zhanchuan customs post on the eastern island of the territory. As "Zhanjiang" was a historical variant of "Zhanchuan", it was decided to name the city "Zhanjiang".

Following the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949, Zhanjiang developed new importance. From 1957, Zhanjiang has developed into a major modern port serving southern China, usable by ships of up to 50,000 tons. In 1984 Zhanjiang was designated one of the "open" cities of China, where the central government invited foreign investment; this spurred the city's further industrial development. It has shipyards and engineering works; automobile, electrical-appliance, and textile plants; and sugar refineries, flour and rice mills, and chemical works.

In the early 1990s a new rail line was completed, linking Zhanjiang with [[Guangzhou]], the provincial capital. The line was later extended to Hai'an, at the southernmost tip of [[Leizhou Peninsula]], where trains could be transported by Guangdong–Hainan Ferry (part of the [[Guangdong–Hainan Railway]]) across the [[Hainan Strait]] to [[Haikou]] city.

==Geography==
[[File:Txu-oclc-10552568-Zhanjiang-full.png|center|thumb|340x340px|Zhanjiang (labeled CHAN-CHIANG (KWANGCHOWWAN) {{lang|zh-hant|湛江}}) (1954)]]
Zhanjiang is to the southwest of the city of [[Guangzhou]] on an inlet of the [[South China Sea]]. It is on the eastern coast of the [[Leizhou Peninsula]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Zhanjiang Government |first1= |title=the overview of Zhanjiang|url=https://www.zhanjiang.gov.cn/mlzj/zjgk/content/post_1300793.html|publisher=Zhanjiang Government}}</ref>

The spoken language in [[Potou District]] and other districts is [[Yue Chinese]] brought by Cantonese peasants that trace their ancestry to rural Guangdong during the French occupation of downtown while the Min speaking majority fled before the French arrived. [[Leizhou Min]] is the prestige language spoken in [[Xiashan District]], [[Mazhang District]], [[Xuwen County]], [[Leizhou City]], etc. The dialect in Lianjiang County is [[Hakka Chinese]].

== Climate ==
Zhanjiang has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] Cwa), with short, mild, overcast winters and long, very hot, humid summers. The monthly daily average temperature in January is 16.2&nbsp;°C (60.6&nbsp;°F), and in July is 29.1&nbsp;°C (84.2&nbsp;°F). From April to September, rainfall is the heaviest and most frequent. The summer and winter temperatures are moderated due to the influence of the nearby ocean.<ref name="travelchinaguide.com">[http://www.travelchinaguide.com/cityguides/guangdong/zhanjiang/ Zhanjiang Travel Guide: Map, History, Attractions].
