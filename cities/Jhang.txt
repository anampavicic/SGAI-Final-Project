== Etymology ==
The historical name of the city and district is Jhang Sial.<ref name=":0" /> The word Jhang is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''jāṅgala'' which means rough or forested terrain; the word [[Jungle]] also shares the same root. ''Jhang Sial'' was the historic name of the city, literally meaning the "terrain of the [[Sials]]".<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Gazetteer - Punjab District Gazetteers, Jhang District, with Map, 1929 - South Asia Archive|url=http://www.southasiaarchive.com/Content/sarf.100009/222773|access-date=2020-09-22|website=www.southasiaarchive.com}}</ref><ref name="HISTORY OF JHANG Jhang" /> 

==History==
The city of Jhang was built in 1288 by Rai Sial, a chief of the Sial tribe.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last=Wikeley|first=J.

Under the collective rule of the Sial Khans of Jhang and other Sial sub-tribes such as the Rajbana and Bharwana, in the zenith of their power, the Sial country of Jhang extended up to the [[Muzaffargarh|Muzafargarh]] boundary in the south, and the entirety of [[Chiniot District|Chiniot]], [[Kamalia]] and [[Kabirwala]] {{transliteration|ur|ilakas}}.  The territory extended to parts of [[Bhakkar District|Bhakkar]] and [[Sargodha Division|Sargodha]]. The [[Garh Maharaja|Garh Mahraja]] and [[Ahmedpur Sial|Ahmadpur Sial]] {{transliteration|ur|ilakas}} were added to the possessions of the Rajbana Sial tribe who drove out the Baloch tribes to the [[Thal Desert|Thal]] and defeated the Nawab of [[Multan]] by the mid 17th century.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />
