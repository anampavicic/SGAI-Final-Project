'''Babahoyo''' ({{IPA|es|baβaˈoʝo}}), founded May 27, 1948, by legislative decree, is the capital of the [[Los Ríos Province|Los Ríos]] province of [[Ecuador]]. Its population is cited around 98,000.  It is bordered by two rivers, the [[San Pablo River (Ecuador)|San Pablo]] and the [[Caracol River (Ecuador)|Caracol]], which join to form the [[Babahoyo River]]. This meets the [[Daule River]] to form the [[Guayas River]], which runs to the [[Pacific Ocean]] at the [[Gulf of Guayaquil]].

A processing and trade center for the surrounding agricultural region, the city handles [[rice]], [[sugarcane]], [[fruit]]s, [[balsa wood]], and [[tagua nut]]s (vegetable ivory). Rice and [[sugar]] are also milled here.

==Geography==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2023}}
The city is located in on the left bank of the San Pablo River, which unites in its estuary with the Catarama River to form the Babahoyo River. One of the most interesting excursions one can take in the area is a boat trip on the Babahoyo River. Babahoyo is located in Litoral and is an obligatory stop to reach the mountains through the highways Babahoyo – Quito (Via Panamericana), Babahoyo – Ambato (Via Flores) and also through Babahoyo – Riobamba. Babahoyo is located in the south of the province of Los Ríos. The roads that unite it with other cities and towns in the coast are Babhoyo – Baba, Babahoyo – Guayaquil and Babahoyo – Milagro. Its geographical location is one of the best because more than 25000 cars, buses, trailers and trucks pass through Babahoyo every day. Babhoyo is a commercial center between the coast and the mountains. Through the urban road network, the city counts on two pedestrian bridges that permit communication between Barreiro and El Salto. There are four bridges for vehicles: the first two cross the Catarama River and the San Pablo river in the north of the city (highway Babahoyo – Quito); the third crosses the Lagarto marsh in the south of the city (highway Babahoyo – Guayaquil); and the fourth is located in the sector of La Ventura (highway Babahoyo – Ambato).

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2023}}
The city of Babahoyo was founded on May 27, 1869 in the lands ceded by the Flores family. Facing the confluence of the Babahoyo River and Caracol River, the city was established on the right bank of the San Pablo River. For a long time it was called Bodegas (warehouses) because the customs and royal stores were located in the city, to control the commerce between Guayaquil and the cities of the Ecuadorian mountains.

Babahoyo suffered from many fires, the worst one occurring on March 30, 1867, which demolished all of the goods of the population, creating a sufficient motive for the government of Dr. Gabriel García Moreno to move the city to its current location. The capital was moved to the other side of the San Pablo River, where the urban district of Barreiro is now located.

It is a prototype of the activity and height of different orders of national life, and will continue to be so, because it has its own resources; it is the backbone of two regions: coast and mountains; being the most influential point in between the two, where the forces of many enterprising villages are bonded; because here the agricultural and commercial aspirations were founded.

In June 2023 Bella Montoya, 76, who had been presumed dead, awoke in a coffin after a five-hour wake and banged on the coffin lid to be let out. [[Health in Ecuador|Ecuador's Health Ministry]] said in a statement on 11 June, that the woman had been admitted to hospital with a suspected [[stroke]] "and went into [[cardiorespiratory arrest]] without responding to resuscitation maneuvers, so the doctor on duty confirmed her death." The Martín Icaza government hospital had declared her dead on Friday. A video posted on [[Twitter]], showing her in her open coffin, breathing heavily, while two men assisted her, went viral on social media.<ref>{{cite news |title=Resurrected: Elderly woman in Ecuador wakes up inside coffin after being declared dead |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/resurrected-elderly-woman-in-ecuador-wakes-up-inside-coffin-after-being-declared-dead/articleshow/100933396.cms |work=The Economic Times |date=12 June 2023}}</ref>

== Transportation ==
Most bus companies running between [[Quito]] and [[Guayaquil]] stop or pass through Babahoyo. [[Quevedo, Ecuador|Quevedo]] connects with Guayaquil by two highways, a less popular one through Balzar and Daule, and one that passes through Babahoyo.

Babahoyo has two Transportation Agencies: Fluminense and The Santa Ana Cooperative. There are 5 bus routes and each of these go from the northeast to the south passing through the city center. There is also transportation by boat which joins the urban parishes of Barreiro and El Salto and the rural parishes of Pimocha and Caracol.

== Rural Districts ==

=== ''La Unión'' ===
Located in the northwest of Babahoyo, close to the mountains, is an agricultural district which is dedicated to fishing and rice, soy and banana cultivation.

=== ''Pimocha'' ===
It is a very large district in regards to area. It borders Puebloviejo county in the north, the Babahoyo River in the south, the Caracol River in the east, and the Garrapata River in the west. Its precincts are Cauge, Guarumo, Chapulo, Convento, Mapan, Sauce, Gallinazo, Papayal, Compañía, Pechiche Dulce, Santa Rita, Las tres bocas, Calabria, Cubon de Caimito, Parindero, Río Grande, Tejar, Providencia, etc. It is certain that it was home to many tribes that formed the Huancavilca villages.

The main source of work and wealth is agriculture although some other industries exist. The ground produces cocoa, rice, sugar cane, coffee, rubber, fine wood, especially oak, cedar and balsa wood. Bananas are exported in large quantities. Also pineapple, sapote, and many wild fruits grow here. Extensive industries other than livestock and fishery are sugar factories and liquor production and rice and coffee farming.

=== ''Caracol'' ===

It is one of the oldest populations. Perhaps like Ojivarm it was the location of an indigenous tribe that the Spanish encountered during their expedition in these lands. In 1838 the population was raised to a category of an ecclesiastical parish, making it independent of the curate of Babahoyo. It borders Catarma in the north, Barriero in the south, Montalvo in the east and is separated from Pimocha in the west by the Caracol River.

=== ''Febres Cordero'' ===

Created in Recinto de Las Juntas on May 14, 1936, its inhabitants are farmers and ranchers. Febres Cordero is one of the most important agricultural centres of the city.{{fact|date=October 2021}}
