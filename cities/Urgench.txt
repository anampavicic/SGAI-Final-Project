It is the capital of [[Xorazm Region]].<ref name=class>{{cite web|url=https://stat.uz/uploads/docs/soato(mhobt)_2020.xlsx|title=Classification system of territorial units of the Republic of Uzbekistan|language=uz, ru|date=July 2020|publisher=The State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on statistics}}</ref> The estimated population of Urgench in 2021 was 145,000,<ref name=xorazmstat>{{cite web|url=https://www.xorazmstat.uz/uz/rasmiy-statistika/demography-2|title=Viloyat bo'yicha shahar va qishloq aholisi soni|trans-title=Urban and rural population in the region|publisher=Xorazm regional department of statistics|language=uz|type=PDF}}</ref> an increase from 139,100 in 1999. It lies on the [[Amu Darya]] River and the Shavat canal. The city is situated {{cvt|450|km|mi}} west of [[Bukhara]] across the [[Kyzyl Kum|Kyzylkum Desert]].

==History==
The history of the city goes back to the second half of the 19th century. The city should not be confused with the similarly named city of [[Konye-Urgench]] (also known as "Old Urgench" or "Gurgench") in [[Turkmenistan]]. The city of Old Urgench was left after the Amu Darya river changed its course in the 16th century, leaving the old town without water. New Urgench was founded by Russians in the second half of the 19th century at the site of a little trade station of the [[Khanate of Khiva]].

Modern Urgench is a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-style city with [[cotton]] motifs adorning many objects, from street lights to apartment houses. Of note is a monument to the twenty [[Komsomol]] members killed by Tekke [[Basmachi Revolt|basmachi]] on the banks of the [[Syr Darya]] in 1922, and a large statue to [[al-Khwarizmi|Muhammad al-Khwarizmi]], the 9th century local [[mathematician]] who revolutionised [[algebra]], outside the Hotel Urgench.  Urgench is the main gateway for tourists to [[Khiva]], {{convert|35|km|mi}} to the southeast, whose old city, known as [[Itchan Kala]], is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

The [[Poland|Polish]] singer [[Anna German]] was born in Urgench in [[1936]].

==Climate==
Urgench has a [[cold desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWk'').
