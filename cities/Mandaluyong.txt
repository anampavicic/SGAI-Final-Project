'''Mandaluyong''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=LL-Q33298 (fil)-Sy.Paul-Mandaluyong.wav|m|ə|n|d|ɑː|'|l|u|j|ɒ|ŋ}} {{respell|mən|dah|LOO|yong}}; {{IPA|tl|mɐndɐˈlujoŋ}}), officially the '''City of Mandaluyong''' ({{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Mandaluyong}}, {{IPA|tl|luŋˈsod nɐŋ mɐndɐˈlujoŋ|}}), is a [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|highly urbanized city]] in the [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]] of the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 425,758 people.{{PH census|current}}

Located directly east of [[Manila]], Mandaluyong was originally a barrio of [[Santa Ana, Manila|Santa Ana de Sapa]] (now a district of Manila) called '''San Felipe Neri'''. It separated and became its own town in 1841, and later acquired the name Mandaluyong in 1931 during the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American occupation]]. In 1994, it became the first municipality of Metro Manila to become a city since the metropolis' establishment in 1975.

At present, it is known for the [[Ortigas Center]], a commercial and business center that it also shares with the city of [[Pasig]]. Notable institutions and establishments in the city include the [[Asian Development Bank]], the headquarters of [[Banco de Oro]] and [[San Miguel Corporation]] and shopping malls like [[Shangri-La Plaza]] and [[SM Megamall]].

The city is bordered by [[Manila]] to the west, [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] to the north, [[Quezon City]] to the northeast, [[Pasig]] to the east, [[Taguig]] to the southeast, and [[Makati]] to the south. It is also the [[List of cities in the Philippines#List|6th-smallest city]] in the Philippines with a land area of {{convert|21.26|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, similar to [[Makati]] and [[Marikina]].

==Etymology==
There are different stories on the origin of the name ''Mandaluyong''.

One tells of how the place was abundant with a kind of tree called ''luyong'', now more commonly known as ''anahaw'' (''[[Saribus rotundifolius]]''),<ref name="ERDB">{{cite web | editor = Marcial C. Amaro Jr. | title = Anahaw | work = Some Familiar Philippine Palms that Produce High Food Value and Tikog | publisher = Ecosystems Research and Development Bureau of the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources | date = January–April 2010 | url = http://erdb.denr.gov.ph/publications/rise/r_v22n1.pdf | access-date = April 1, 2013 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130522064720/http://erdb.denr.gov.ph/publications/rise/r_v22n1.pdf| url-status =dead| archive-date =May 22, 2013}}</ref> from which canes and furniture were made.

Another claims that the Spaniards named the place based on the report of a navigator named Acapulco, who saw the rolling hills frequently being lashed at by ''daluyong'' (“big waves from the sea”).<ref name=mandabook>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4PVwAAAAMAAJ|title=Pasig City: Portrait of a New Metropolis|date=2008-09-10|author=Duldulao, Manuel D.|publisher=Japuzinni Publication Division|page=31|oclc=53951089|accessdate=2023-11-22}}</ref> This seems to confirm traditional pre-Hispanic stories that giant waves from the sea would meet the adjoining hills of the vast lowland, referred to as ''salpukan ng alon''. Felix dela Huerta, a [[Franciscan]] historian, observed that the rolling topography of this land resembled giant waves of the sea.

As with the etymological legends of many Philippine places, when the foreigners asked what the place was called, the locals answered with the description "''madaluyong''" ("undulating"), later transcribed by Spanish writers as "Mandaluyong," with the addition of an “n”.

Another version of the name is based on a legend that a [[Maharlika]] named Luyong fell in love with Manda, the lovely daughter of a [[barangay]] chieftain. The chieftain did not like Luyong and forbade him Manda's hand. Luyong overcame this objection by winning a series of tribal contests, as was the custom at the time. The couple settled thereafter in a place which was later called “Mandaluyong" – a term made up of [[portmanteau|joining their names]].<ref name="RidiculousEtymology">{{Cite news |work=Manila Bulletin|url=https://news.mb.com.ph/2019/09/22/murals-of-folklore-lovers-manda-luyong-brighten-shaw-blvd-flyover |title=Murals of folklore lovers 'Manda', 'Luyong' brighten Shaw Blvd flyover |access-date=October 18, 2019 |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=esquire>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.esquiremag.ph/long-reads/features/story-names-cities-of-manila-a00304-20191021-lfrm|title=A Short History Behind the Name of Every Metro Manila City|website=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|publisher=[[Summit Media]]|issn=2243-8459|date=2019-10-21|accessdate=2023-11-22}}</ref>

==History==
{{More citations needed section|date=May 2018}}

===Early history===
Residents of Mandaluyong have always been known for their industry. Men did the laundry to the amusement of non-residents until shortly after the war, while the women ironed the clothes.

These industrious people trace their roots to Emperor Soledan (also known as "Anka Widyaya" of the Great Madjapahit Empire) and Empress Sasaban of the [[Namayan|Kingdom of Sapa]], whose son Prince Balagtas ruled as sovereign of the kingdom in about the year 1300.

More than a century later, in about the year 1470, it expanded and was called the "[[Namayan|Kingdom of Namayan]]" with "Lakan Takhan" as sovereign. The vast Kingdom comprised what are now [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]], [[San Miguel, Manila|San Miguel]], [[Santa Mesa, Manila|Sta, Mesa]], [[Paco, Manila|Paco]], [[Pandacan]], Malate, [[Manila|Malate]] and [[Santa Ana, Manila|Santa Ana]] in [[Manila]], and Mandaluyong, [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]], [[Makati]], [[Pasay]], [[Pateros]], [[Taguig]], [[Parañaque]], and portions of [[Pasig]] and [[Quezon City]] up to [[Diliman]], which were then part of Mandaluyong.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mandaluyong.gov.ph/profile/history.aspx?node=1 |title=City of Mandaluyong : Brief History: Political History |publisher=Mandaluyong.gov.ph |access-date=September 24, 2019}}</ref>

===Spanish colonial era===
====Foundation====
Mandaluyong was first known as a barrio of [[Santa Ana, Manila|Santa Ana de Sapa]], which was part of the District of [[Paco, Manila|Paco]], [[Manila (province)|Province of Tondo]] (later known as the Province of Manila). It was named '''San Felipe Neri''' by the Spaniards in honor of the [[St. Philip Neri|patron saint]] of [[Rome]]. It was separated civilly from Santa Ana de Sapa in 1841.

On September 15, 1863, San Felipe Neri established its own parish. Under the administration of the Congregation “Dulcísimo Nombre de Jesús” ({{translation|Sweet Name of Jesus|literal=yes}}), it constructed its own church, convent and school. The Parish of San Felipe Neri played a significant role as a relay station for propagating the Katipunan during the 1896–1898 Revolution.

====Original barrios====
According to Pedro Patricio in his book ''Mandaluyong: 1837–1975'', Mandaluyong had five original barrios: Poblacion, Barangka, Hagdang Bato, Namayan, and Hulo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elib.gov.ph/details.php?uid=a5f44949e8126bf8b90715cf7e41c083 |title=Philippine eLib |publisher=Elib.gov.ph |date=June 16, 2008 |access-date=September 24, 2019}}</ref> This was according to the first recorded census in 1903. From these five evolved 22 sub-barrios.

====The Philippine revolution====
Mandaluyong was significant in the [[Philippine Revolution]] of 1896 as the baluarte (territory) of the Katipunan or "Makabuhay" group, with seventeen branches.<ref name="Mandaluyong.gov.ph">{{cite web|url=http://mandaluyong.gov.ph/profile/history.aspx?node=1 |title=City of Mandaluyong : Brief History : Political History |publisher=Mandaluyong.gov.ph |access-date=September 24, 2019}}</ref>

On August 29, 1896, [[Andres Bonifacio]], together with [[Emilio Jacinto]] and other members of the [[Katipunan]] went into the house of Romualdo Vicencio at Sitio Balakbak (now Villa San Miguel) to prepare for the upcoming revolution against Spanish authority. In this site, Bonifacio read the last manifestation of the Katipunan before they transferred in Hagdan Bato, in the house of Felix Sanchez. This event is also known as the "29 De Agosto" and "Pinagtipunan" in which it is already named in two streets near the historic Barangay Hagdan Bato Itaas. It was in Barangay Hagdang Bato on August 28, 1896, where Andres Bonifacio issued a proclamation setting Saturday, August 29, 1896, as the date of the attack on Manila.

On August 30, 1896, after the successfully revolution in San Felipe Neri, the Katipuneros went to San Juan del Monte and attacked the El Polvorin (gunpowder depot) in order to amass more weapons to use against the Spaniards. This event is popularly known as the [[Battle of San Juan del Monte]]. It was also in this town that the revolutionary paper, ''La Republika'', was established on September 15, 1896.

===American colonial era===
On June 11, 1901, San Felipe Neri was incorporated into the newly established province of [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]]. During the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American Occupation]], it was raised to a first-class municipality with five barrios, namely: Poblacion, Barangka, Hagdang Bato, Namayan and Hulo. By virtue of Act No. 942 dated November 6, 1903, it was consolidated with the municipality of [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan del Monte]] and became the seat of the municipal government.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l8ae8|number=984|date=November 6, 1903|access-date=July 10, 2022|title=An Act Amending Acy Numbered Nine Hundred and Forty-Two, Entitled "An Act Reducing the Thirty-Two Municipalities of the Province of Rizal to Fifteen," by Reducing the Thirty-Two Municipalities of the Said Province to Sixteen|publisher=Lawyerly}}</ref> For several months in 1904, San Felipe Neri became the capital of Rizal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2002/06/28/the-presidents-day-june-28-2002/|title=The President's Day: June 28, 2002|date=June 28, 2002|accessdate=June 16, 2023|website=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines]]}}</ref> San Juan del Monte was later separated from San Felipe Neri to regain its independent municipality status on March 27, 1907.<ref name="Act-1625">{{Cite PH act |url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l4d28 |date=March 27, 1907 |title=An Act Increasing The Number Of Municipalities In The Province Of Rizal From Seventeen To Nineteen, By Separating From San Felipe Neri The Former Municipality Of San Juan Del Monte And From Parañaque The Former Municipality Of Las Piñas, Giving To Each The Territory Which It Comprised Prior To The Passage Of Act Numbered Nine Hundred And Forty-two, And Providing For The Distribution Of Funds In The Municipal Treasuries Of Said Municipalities |chamber=Act |number=1625|access-date=July 10, 2022|publisher=Lawyerly}}</ref>

San Felipe Neri was renamed to its present name of Mandaluyong on November 6, 1931, by virtue of Act No. 3836.<ref>{{cite act|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%203836|index=3836|date=November 6, 1931|legislature=[[9th Philippine Legislature]]|access-date=April 17, 2022|title= Act Changing the Name of Municipality of San Felipe Neri, in the Province of Rizal, to Mandaluyong}}</ref> Many government infrastructures are established during the American Period, including the Correctional Institute for Women, Welfareville Compound, The Boy's Town, and the [[National Center for Mental Health]].

===Japanese occupation era=== 
From 1942 to 1945, during [[World War II]], Mandaluyong formed part of the [[City of Greater Manila]], along with Manila, Quezon City, and other nearby towns of Rizal.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=EO|number=400, s. 1942|title=Creating the City of Greater Manila|date=January 1, 1942|access-date=August 24, 2022|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1942/01/01/executive-order-no-400-s-1942/|publisher=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines]]}}</ref><ref name="eo58">{{cite PH act|chamber=EO|number=58, s. 1945|title=Reducing the Territory of the City of Greater Manila|date=July 26, 1945|access-date=August 24, 2022|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1945/07/26/executive-order-no-58-s-1945/|publisher=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette]]}}</ref> Also during the war, Mandaluyong lost many of her people; among them were Catholic priests and civilians. Destruction was felt all over, but with the timely arrival of the American Liberation Forces and the Philippine Commonwealth troops on February 9, 1945, the municipality was saved from further damages. That day became a red calendar day for Mandaluyong marking its liberation from the Japanese Imperial forces by the Allies.

===Philippine independence===

After World War II, Mandaluyong began to become progressive and dramatically increase the economy. Many infrastructures, companies, and other businesses were developed in 1950s–1960s and as the result, making Mandaluyong recognized as the most developed municipality in the province of Rizal.<ref name="Mandaluyong.gov.ph"/>

Mandaluyong played a small part in Ferdinand Marcos' efforts to rationalize his [[Proclamation No. 1081|declaration]] of [[Martial Law under Ferdinand Marcos|Martial law]] because the alleged [[1972 ambush of Juan Ponce Enrile]] took place in Wack Wack, an exclusive neighborhood in Mandaluyong, in the hours immediately preceding its implementation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://martiallawmuseum.ph/magaral/442/|title=The Night of the Declaration|work=Martial Law Museum|access-date=May 21, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>  Because the alleged ambush took place in an exclusive subdivision, no independent eyewitnesses of the event have come forward, and witnesses of the immediate aftermath are few.<ref name="PhoenixLopez">{{Cite book |last=Rodrigo |first=Raul |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45583759 |title=Phoenix : the saga of the Lopez family |date=2000 |publisher=Eugenio Lopez Foundation |isbn=971-92114-1-5 |edition=1st |location=Manila |oclc=45583759}}</ref> This has lent credence to accounts which say that the ambush was faked, and that the site was selected specifically because it was easy to stage the incident there.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Conjugal Dictatorship of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos|last=Mijares|first=Primitivo|year=2016|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |isbn=978-1523292196}}</ref><ref name="PDItrueorfalse">{{Cite web |date=October 8, 2012 |title=True or false: Was 1972 Enrile ambush faked? |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/284836/true-or-false-was-1972-enrile-ambush-faked}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Manila |first=Quijano de |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65719625 |title=The quartet of the tiger moon : scenes from the people-power apocalypse |date=1986 |publisher=Book Stop |isbn=971-8523-01-4 |edition=2nd printing (Pbk popular ed.) |location=[S.l.] |oclc=65719625}}</ref> The 14-year period which followed that night is remembered for the Marcos administration's record of [[Human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship|human rights abuses]],<ref name="McCoy199909202">{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/54a/062.html|title=Alfred McCoy, Dark Legacy: Human rights under the Marcos regime|date=September 20, 1999|publisher=[[Ateneo de Manila University]]}}</ref><ref name="Abinales&Amoroso20052">{{Cite book|title=State and society in the Philippines|last=N.|first=Abinales, P.|date=2005|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-0742510234|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=57452454}}</ref> particularly targeting political opponents, student activists, journalists, religious workers, farmers, and others who fought against the [[Dictatorship|Marcos dictatorship]].<ref name="Rappler7Youth">{{Cite news|url=https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/182828-marcos-dictatorship-martial-law-youth-leaders-killed|title=Gone too soon: 7 youth leaders killed under Martial Law|work=Rappler|access-date=June 15, 2018}}</ref>

====Industrial growth and government takeover efforts ====
A prominent figure in Philippine business before Martial Law was Mandaluyong-based industrialist Domingo M. Guevara Sr., whose success began when he created Radiowealth, a brand of affordable Philippine-made appliances including radios and televisions.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Remembering DMG: Self-Made Entrepreneur |url=http://ph.news.yahoo.com/remembering-dmg-self-made-entrepreneur-091445720--finance.html |access-date=2022-12-19 |website=ph.news.yahoo.com |language=en-PH}}</ref> This eventually became the Mandaluyong-based Guevara Enterprises which dominated the fields of electronics, communications, agriculture and industrial development, transportation, and manufacturing in the Philippines, whose headquarters was on Libertad (now D.M.

====Separation from Rizal province====
{{main|Metro Manila}}
On November 7, 1975, Mandaluyong was formally included in newly established Metropolitan Manila by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 824<ref>"{{cite PH act|chamber=PD|number=824|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1975/11/07/presidential-decree-no-824-s-1975/|date=November 7, 1975 |title=Creating The Metropolitan Manila And The Metropolitan Manila Commission And For Other Purposes |access-date=July 17, 2014 |publisher=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines]]|df=dmy-all }}"</ref> signed by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
By virtue of the 1987 Constitution, Mandaluyong and the then-municipality of San Juan were represented in Congress by a single congressman.

[[Legislative district of San Juan–Mandaluyong|San Juan–Mandaluyong]] Representative [[Ronaldo Zamora]] sponsored a House Bill which eventually became Republic Act No. 7675<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=RA|number=7675|date=1995-02-09|url=http://www.congress.gov.ph/download/ra_09/RA07675.pdf |title=Charter of the City of Mandaluyong|access-date=2016-02-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303222947/http://www.congress.gov.ph/download/ra_09/RA07675.pdf |archive-date= March 3, 2016|publisher=[[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] }}</ref> otherwise known as "An Act Converting the Municipality of Mandaluyong into a Highly Urbanized City to be known as the City of Mandaluyong." President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] signed R.A. No. 7675 into law on February 9, 1994 (the 49th anniversary of its liberation from the Japanese), which was ratified through a plebiscite on April 10, 1994, making Mandaluyong the fifth city in [[Metro Manila]]. Mandaluyong became a lone district with its own representative in Congress. Prior to the enactment of the assailed statute, the municipalities of Mandaluyong and San Juan belonged to only one legislative district.

===Contemporary===
Mandaluyong today is composed of 27 barangays divided into two political districts mainly by Boni Avenue and G. Aglipay Street.

In 2002, Mandaluyong was recognized as "The Tiger City of the Philippines" because of the dramatic improvement in the city's economy.<ref>{{Cite web |date=May 8, 2002 |title=Mandaluyong is new 'tiger city' |url=https://www.philstar.com/metro/2002/05/08/160095/mandaluyong-new-145tiger-city146 |access-date=June 21, 2024 |website=[[The Philippine Star]]}}</ref>

Thus, Mandaluyong is located at the center of Metro Manila.

The city is home to a number of shopping centers, entertainment hubs, commercial establishments, high-rise offices, residential condominiums and hotels. The city is one of the important business and financial areas in the metropolis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mandaluyong.gov.ph/profile/index.aspx|title=Mandaluyong City Profile |access-date=February 9, 2014 |publisher=City Government of Mandaluyong}}</ref>

=== Commercial activities===
[[File:Mandaluyong City View (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Various buildings in the southern part of Mandaluyong.]]
Like other cities in [[Metro Manila]], Mandaluyong has its own share of commercial strips and a central business district.
The former commercial area, consisting mostly of banks, offices and service establishments, stretch along public transport routes thereby serving both local consumers and passers-by from the neighboring localities.
Major commercial strips of the city include the stretch of [[Boni Avenue]], [[Shaw Boulevard]], Libertad-Sierra Madre area, Kalentong, San Francisco, part of Martinez, Sgt. Bumatay towards Barangka Drive and Pinatubo towards [[EDSA]]. Mandaluyong's central business district is concentrated on the EDSA-Shaw-Pioneer area; it includes the [[Greenfield District]] development.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mandaluyong.gov.ph/profile/economy.aspx|title=Commercial Activities |access-date=February 9, 2014 |publisher=City Government of Mandaluyong}}</ref>

===Industrial activities===
[[File:TV5 Media Center - reliance side (Reliance cor. Sheridan, Mandaluyong; 2017-01-06).jpg|thumb|right|[[TV5 Media Center]]]]
Industrial activities are mostly concentrated within the [[Shaw Boulevard]]-[[Pioneer Street|Pioneer area]] and along the [[Pasig River]]. Although prominent in the manufacture of foods, medicines and laboratory equipment, these industries are gradually declining in number, opting to relocate in newly developed industrial zones outside Metropolitan Manila. In the [[Pasig River]] area, particularly in Barangays Namayan and Mabini–J. Rizal, areas formerly industrial are now the sites for residential subdivisions and townhouses.
