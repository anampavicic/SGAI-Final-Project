'''Baripada''' ({{transliteration|or|IAST|bāripadā}}) is a city and a [[municipality]] in [[Mayurbhanj district]] in the state of [[Odisha]], India. Located along the east bank of the [[Budhabalanga]] river, Baripada is the cultural centre of north Odisha.<ref name=Britannica>{{Cite web |title=Baripada {{!}} Tribal Culture, Wildlife & Temples {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Baripada |access-date=18 February 2024 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> In recent years, it has emerged as an educational hub with the opening of numerous professional colleges.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Odisha Tourism : Baripada|url=https://odishatourism.gov.in/content/tourism/en/discover/major-cities/baripada.html|access-date=8 June 2020|website=odishatourism.gov.in}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Welcome To North Orissa University|url=http://www.nou.nic.in/|access-date=8 June 2020|website=www.nou.nic.in}}</ref>

The city is the headquarters of [[Mayurbhanj district]], Odisha's largest district by area. It houses the office of the [[District collector (India)|District collector]], the Superintendent of Police and the Court of the District and Sessions Judge. <ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=About District {{!}} Mayurbhanj District |url=https://mayurbhanj.nic.in/about-district/ |website=Government of Odisha |access-date=8 June 2020}}</ref>

==History==
{{See also|Mayurbhanj State|Mayurbhanj State Railway}}
Baripada became the headquarters of the state (now district) at the end of the 18th century during Sumitra Devi's rule, succeeding its earlier status in [[Haripur Gada|Haripur]]. However, it was initially documented as Burpuddah by Major [[James Rennell]] of the [[East India Company]] in his renowned 1779 Atlas, well before it assumed the role of the state headquarters. Although the history of Baripada is uncertain, it is believed that the name probably derived from the [[Bauri (caste)|Bauri]] or [[Bathudi Tribe|Bathudi tribe]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nagendra-Natha Vasu |url=http://archive.org/details/archaeologicals01nage |title=The archaeological survey of Mayurabhanja |date=1912 |publisher=[Calcutta Printed by U.N. Bhattacharyya at the Hare Press] |others=University of British Columbia Library |pages=4}}</ref>

The ruins of an old mud fort in the centre of the town have completely disappeared. A temple dedicated to Ambika Devi is the sole survivor. The chief shrine of the town is a [[Jagannath]] temple dating from 1575 AD. It is also the oldest structure in the area. A statue of the Buddhist deity [[Lokeshvara]] housed in one of its rooms is even older. However, Baripada developed into a town only under the rule of Maharaja Jadunatha Bhanja who died in 1863. His successors, especially Maharaja [[Sriram Chandra Bhanj Deo]], added many other public infrastructure to the town. Baripada was linked to [[Rupsa]] in [[Balasore district]] through a narrow gauge line known as the [[Mayurbhanj State Railway]] in the first decade of the 20th century. This provided a major impetus to trade and commerce.

The town continued to grow after the merger of Mayurbhanj State with the Union of India in 1949. In contrast to the planned nature of the town centre, the newer areas have tended to adopt a sprawling nature.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History {{!}} Mayurbhanj District, Government of Odisha {{!}} India|url=https://mayurbhanj.nic.in/history/|access-date=8 June 2020|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Economics==
Baripada is home to many forest-based products such as timber, but due to heavy deforestation the sawmills were banned within a 25&nbsp;km radius. Baripada is known for ''Sabai'' grass plantations, an African grass introduced to Baripada and was first planted in Hamilton Garden that grows on red volcanic soil and has strong fibres that are used for rope making known as ''Bubei''. It has many cashew plantation fields. ''Khali'' (plates) and ''Duna'' (bowls) making, from leaves of Sal tree leaves (''[[Shorea robusta]]''), is another business that local men engage in.

It has many brick kilns on the banks of river Budhabalaga, which is the only perennial river flowing through the city. Timber remains one of the major sources of income for the local populace.

==Culture==
Baripada is popular for its art and culture. Many famous stars of [[Ollywood]] (Oriya film industry) are from Baripada. Baripada is famous for the [[Chhau dance]] form, famous all over the world. The Chaitra Parva celebrated in mid-April recognises the local talents. Uttarsahi and Dakshinsahi are two main groups who perform in this festival with many other participants. Jhumar Song is popular in Baripada.

Baripada is the second place, after [[Puri]], where the tradition of [[Ratha-Yatra|Ratha Yatra]] (Car festival of Lord [[Jagannath]]) began. Hence Baripada is called 'Dwitiya Srikhetra' (second Puri). Baripada's Ratha Yatra is popular for its unique tradition of allowing only women to pull the chariot of [[Subhadra|Goddess Subhadra]].

Maa Ambika Temple is one of the chief temples and [[Parvati|Maa Ambika]] is a highly revered deity in this region. It is in Badabazar, 1&nbsp;km from Baripada bus stand.

[[Jagadhatri Mela]] at [[Bhanjpur]] is another big [[mela]]. It is the festival of Maa [[Jagadhatri]], Goddess of the whole world. There is a 10–15 days mela known as mini [[Bali Jatra]] (named after Cuttack's Bali Jatra) which takes place at Jagadhatri Mela grounds, near the Bhanjpur railway Station during October–November. It is celebrated on Gosthastami. The [[Durga Puja]] in Baripada is also very popular.[[File:Maa Subhadra Rath of Baripada Rathyatra 2012.JPG|thumb|Maa Subhadra Rath of Baripada Rathyatra 2012]]
