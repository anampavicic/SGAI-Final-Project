'''Ufa''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|uː|f|ə}} {{respell|OO-fə}}; {{langx|ru|Уфа}} {{IPA|ru|ʊˈfa|}}; {{langx|ba|Өфө|Öfö}}, {{IPA|ba|ʏ̞ˈfʏ̞|IPA|Ba-Өфө.ogg}}) is the largest city in and the [[capital city|capital]] of [[Bashkortostan]], [[Russia]]. The city lies at the confluence of the [[Belaya River (Kama)|Belaya]] and [[Ufa River|Ufa]] rivers, in the centre-north of Bashkortostan, on hills forming the [[Ufa Plateau]] to the west of the southern [[Ural Mountains]], with a population of over 1.1 million residents,<ref name=est.2020>{{cite web |title=RUSSIA: Privolžskij Federal'nyj Okrug: Volga Federal District |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/russia/cities/volga/ |publisher=City Population.de |date=August 4, 2020|access-date=October 20, 2020}}</ref> up to 1.4 million residents in the urban agglomeration. Ufa is the [[list of cities and towns in Russia by population|tenth-most populous city]] in Russia, and the fourth-most populous city in the [[Volga Federal District]].

The city was founded in 1574, when a fortress was built on the site by the order of [[Ivan the Terrible]]. Ufa was made capital of [[Ufa Governorate]] in 1865 when the governorate split from [[Orenburg Governorate]]. Ufa's population expanded during the early 20th century.

Today, Ufa's economy consists primarily of the oil refining, chemistry, and mechanical engineering industries; the petroleum company [[Bashneft]] and several of its subsidiaries are headquartered in Ufa. Ufa is an ethnically diverse city, home to a substantial number of ethnic [[Bashkirs]] and [[Tatars]], with an ethnic [[Russians|Russian]] majority population. Several educational institutions are located in Ufa, including [[Bashkir State University]], [[Ufa State Aviation Technical University]], [[Ufa State Petroleum Technological University]], and [[Ural State Law University]]. The city hosted separate summits of the [[BRICS]] group as well as the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]] in 2015.

== Etymology ==
The name ''Ufa'' comes from the [[Ufa River]] on which the city lies, but the origin of the river's name is disputed. The Russian linguist [[Aleksandr Matveyev (linguist)|Aleksandr Matveyev]] proposes that the name is of [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] origin, from "ap", meaning water.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Matveyev |first=Aleksandr |date=2008 |title=Географические названия Урала: Топонимический словарь. — Екатеринбург |journal=Socrates |pages=294–296}}</ref>

In a paper published in 2014, researchers Karimov and Khabibov from Bashkir State Pedagogical University present and argue for a hypothesis according to which before the construction of the foundational Russian fortress in 1574, which has since grown to become the current city of Ufa, there had  already been an ancient settlement called Ufa on a hilltop near the mouth of the Ufa River. According to them, this settlement was founded by Turkic-speaking tribes to perform rituals and sacrifices to the sky god Tengri, and they called this place Upe or Ufe because, they argue, in ancient Turkic languages a place of ritual sacrifice used to be called an "opo" or an "ope." They further hypothesize that the inhabitants of the settlement themselves also came to be called the Upe or Ufe tribe and subsequently, the river along which they flourished and expanded their settlement towards its source also came to be called Ufa. Karimov and Khabibov claim that the Russian fortress builders were probably aware of this ancient name and consequently named their new settlement Ufa.<ref>{{Citation |title=To the question of origin of the city name Ufa |author1=S.

Early history of the surrounding area of Ufa dates back to [[Paleolithic]] times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gorodufa.ru/?p=41|title=Официальный сайт Администрации города Уфы|website=www.gorodufa.ru}}</ref> Presumably, from the 5th to 16th centuries there was a medieval city on the site of Ufa.<ref>Псянчин А.

French orientalist [[Henri Cordier]] associates the position of Pascherti with the current location of Ufa.<ref name="Henri Cordier">«Mercator and Hondius (loth Ed., 1630) and N.

The official of the [[Orenburg Governorate]] government Vasily Rebelensky wrote that Ufa was founded by the Bashkirs.<ref>«Краткое описание губернского города Уфы с начала его построения до сего 1806 года». // Что ж касается башкирцев, то видно из многих описаний, как сего народа, так и о жительстве их, кои от различных возмущений, как и междоусобных воин, так и соседних своих народов, строили маленькие укрепления и городки и наконец, соединясь во множестве, распространили свои жилища и укрепления, а для сей причины и город Уфа построен.</ref>

Before becoming the seat of a separate [[Ufa Governorate]] in 1781, the city, along with the rest of the Bashkir lands, was under the jurisdiction of the [[Orenburg]] governors. And even though the 1796 reform reunited Orenburg and Ufa again, in 1802, the city of Ufa became a new center of the entire [[Orenburg Governorate]] that included large territories of modern-day [[Republic of Bashkortostan]], [[Orenburg Oblast]], and [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]].

The [[Belaya River (Kama)|Belaya River]] Waterway (1870) and the [[Kuybyshev Railway|Samara-Zlatoust Railroad]] (1890) connected the city to the European part of the [[Russian Empire]] and stimulated the development of the city's light industry.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}} During [[World War II]], following eastward Soviet retreat in 1941, the [[Abwehr]] operated in Ufa, 1941–1943,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vechufa.ru/public/4869-smert-shpionam.html|title=Смерть шпионам! » Вечерняя Уфа, официальный сайт газеты "Вечерняя Уфа"|website=Вечерняя Уфа, официальный сайт газеты "Вечерняя Уфа"}}</ref> some German infiltration, occurred 1914–1943 in espionage, many industrial enterprises of the western parts of the Soviet Union were evacuated to Ufa. On June 4th 1989 the [[Ufa train disaster]] would occur about 75 kilometers away from the city when a [[pipeline]] leak made a cloud of gas near the tracks and when 2 trains approached the sparks from the breaks of one train ignited the gas causing a massive explosion which killed 575 people.

During 9–10 July 2015, Ufa hosted summits of the [[BRICS|BRICS group]] and the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ufa2015.com/|title=西甲在线观看免费观看-网友分享|website=www.ufa2015.com}}</ref>

Неприятный химический запах в городе, в чем причина? Источник материала]</ref> The media reports about the smell come out with an impressive regularity. Not all these reports are groundless, and the culprits are getting out of responsibility due to the fact that there is no Continuous Emission Control System (CEMS) in the city.

There are no street vacuum cleaners, road vacuum sweepers, or industrial (street) vacuum cleaners on the streets.{{cn|date=November 2023}} Unfortunately, there is a complete lack of sanitation services in the city.{{cn|date=November 2023}}

Suspended substances (dust) are measured at all nine posts of the state observation network. The results of observations of the pollutants content are presented on the official website of the Bashkir State Hydrometeorological Service in the section "Monitoring of environmental pollution"<ref>http://www.meteorb.ru/monitorinu/air-pollution-ufa {{Dead link|date=February 2022}}</ref> daily and monthly. In 2017, the maximum single concentration of suspended solids reached 4.6 MPC m. in March 2017, at the address: Oktyabrya Ave., 141, located near the motorway with heavy traffic, and in April 2017 at the post: Dostoyevsky St., 102/1, located in the area of the industrial enterprise. During 2017 almost all posts of the state observation network recorded exceedances of a single concentration of suspended substances. At the same time, in order to implement regional state environmental oversight aimed at preventing, detecting, and suppressing violations by public authorities, local authorities, and legal entities, individual entrepreneurs and citizens of requirements in the field of atmospheric air protection, under the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment of the Republic Bashkortostan operates the State Bank of the Republic of Belarus "Office of State Analytical Control," to whose tasks, including GSI "organization of periodic [[environmental monitoring]] mobile laboratories in the areas where the population lives in the republic and in the zones of protective measures in the system of the general program of integrated environmental and sanitary-hygienic monitoring."
