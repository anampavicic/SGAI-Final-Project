==History==
=== Foundation of Mandi Bhauddin ===
In 1506 C.E. a Gondal tribal Chief named Bahauddin established a settlement namely [[Pindi Bahauddin]], after his migration from Pindi [[Shahjahanian]] to this area.<ref name=DPO/> The town started growing in early 20th century near the ancient village named as Chak No.51, where [[Sikh]], [[Hindu]] and [[Muslim]] businessmen and land owners came to settle. John Alam made the map of this chak, which became the center of this new town [[Pindi Bahauddin]]. later in 1920 because of famous grain market setup in this Chak No. 51, it was given name of Mandi-Bahauddin, in 1923 all the streets and roads were laid straight and wide. In 1924 Pindi-Bahauddin Railway station was given the name of [[Mandi Bahauddin railway station]]. In 1937 when Mandi-Bahauddin was town, it was given the status of a town committee and in 1941 it got the status of a Municipal Committee. In the master plan of reconstructing this town. In 1946, nine gates and the walls were retied around this town.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mbdin.com/ |website=Mandi Bahauddin.com website|title=History of Pindi-Bahauddin (known as Purrani Pindi) |archive-url=https://mbdin.com/pindi-bahauddin/ |archive-date=16 May 2012|date=6 January 2009|access-date=30 July 2021}}</ref>

===Early history===
The recorded history of Mandi Bahauddin goes back to the era of [[Alexander the Great]]. Some 8&nbsp;km northwest of the modern-day Mandi Bahauddin town, at the village [[Mong, Punjab|Mong]] on the southern bank of the [[Jhelum River]] (Greek ''Hydaspes''), the battle [[Battle of the Hydaspes River]] was fought between [[King Porus|Raja Porus]] (Sanskrit ''Paurava'') and (The Great Tribe Chadhar) and [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]. This historic battle of Jhelum River took place in 326&nbsp;BCE.<ref>Kaushik Roy, ''India's historic battles: from Alexander the great to Kargil'', Delhi: Permanent Black, 2004, p. 11</ref> The kingdom of Raja Porus was situated in the northern [[Punjab region|Punjab]] of modern [[Pakistan]]. This was the last major fight of Alexander's career; the Macedonians, after finding a fierce resistance by Porus, and having heard of a massive 4,000 elephant force mustered by eastern kingdoms, refused to march further toward the Ganges Plains. The Sadar Gate built during the British era in 1933 is present here.<ref>Ruth Sheppard, ''Alexander the Great at War: His Army – His Battles – His Enemies'', Oxford: Osprey Publishing, 2008, p. 206</ref>
