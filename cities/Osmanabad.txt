==Etymology and history==
{{More citations needed section|date=February 2021}}
Osmanabad derives its name from the last ruler of Hyderabad, the 7th Nizam, [[Mir Osman Ali Khan]], of which the region was a part of until 1948.<ref name="PrintJul2022">{{cite news |title=Dharashiv, new name for Osmanabad, dates back to eighth century: expert |url=https://theprint.in/india/dharashiv-new-name-for-osmanabad-dates-back-to-eighth-century-expert/1020488/ |access-date=19 June 2023 |work=ThePrint |agency=PTI |date=1 July 2022}}</ref> As per historical evidence, the district was ruled by the [[Mauryas]], [[Satavahanas]], [[Rashtrakutas]], and [[Yadavas of Deogiri|Yadavas]]. In early centuries the city belonged to the Hindu Chalukyas and Devagiri Yadavas, but later became a part of the Bahmani and Bijapur kingdoms.

For a period of time, Osmanabad was also ruled by the Mughals, Bahmani, Nizam and Adil Shah kingdoms. Before the Hyderabad Nizam's rule, it was under the control of the Mughal King Aurangzeb. Being under Nizam rule, the district did not celebrate its freedom when the rest of India became independent in 1947. However, in 1948, Hyderabad State was merged with independent India and the district became a part of the then Bombay State. It became a part of Maharashtra State when the State was formed in 1960. Osmanabad has a historical lineage dating back to the days of Marathwada, and even before that to several kingdoms of which the region was a part.

Osmanabad was officially renamed as Dharashiv in February 2023.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Aurangabad formally renamed Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Osmanabad as Dharashiv|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/aurangabad-formally-renamed-chhatrapati-sambhajinagar-osmanabad-as-dharashiv-101694855493622.html|website=Hindustan Times|language=en|date=16 September 2023}}</ref> The name derives from the [[Dharashiv Caves]].<ref name="PrintJul2022"/>
