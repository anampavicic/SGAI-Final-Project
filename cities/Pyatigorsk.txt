'''Pyatigorsk''' ({{langx|ru|Пятиго́рск}}; [[Circassian languages|Circassian]]: Псыхуабэ, ''Psıxwabæ'') is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] in [[Stavropol Krai]], Russia located on the [[Podkumok River]], about {{convert|20|km|sp=us}} from the town of [[Mineralnye Vody]], which has an international airport, and about {{convert|45|km|sp=us}} from [[Kislovodsk]]. Since January&nbsp;19, 2010, it has been the [[administrative center]] of the [[North Caucasian Federal District]] of Russia. Population: {{ru-census|p2010=142,511|p2002=140,559|p1989=129,499}}{{Historical populations|1897|18440|1926|41000|1939|63162|1959|69617|1970|93085|1979|109901|1989|129499|2002|140559|2010|142511|2021|146473|type=|footnote=Source: Census data}}

==Overview==
The name is derived from the fused Russian words "{{lang|ru|пять гор}}" (''five mountains'') and the city is so called because of the five peaks of the [[Beshtau]] (which also means ''five mountains'' in [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]) of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] overlooking the city. Founded in 1780,<ref name="megabook" /> it has been a health spa with [[mineral spring]]s since 1803, as part of the [[Caucasian Mineral Waters]]. 

Russian poet [[Mikhail Lermontov]] was shot by Nikolai Martynov in a [[duel]] at Pyatigorsk on July&nbsp;27, 1841. There is a museum in the city devoted to his memory. The [[Zionist]] activist [[Joseph Trumpeldor]] was born in Pyatigorsk.

==History==
[[File:Piatigorsk.jpg|thumb|left|View of Pyatigorsk between 1890 and 1900.]]

The writings of the 14th-century Arabian traveler [[Ibn Battuta]] included the earliest known mention of the mineral springs. [[Peter the Great]] (reigned 1682–1725) fostered the earliest scientific study of them, but the information collected on his expedition has not survived. Interest revived at the end of the 18th century with the foundation of the first Russian settlement (Konstantinogorskaya fortress), erected at Mt.&nbsp;Mashuk in 1780.<ref name="megabook" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Battutah|first1=Ibn|title=The Travels of Ibn Battutah|date=2002|publisher=Picador|location=London|isbn=9780330418799|pages=124}}</ref>

The value of the Caucasian mineral waters led to the construction of a resort in 1803, and studies of their medical properties began thereafter: on April&nbsp;24, [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;I]] signed a decree which made the mineral waters state property. Many settlements developed near the springs: first Goryachevodsk (now part of Pyatigorsk) at the bottom of Mt.&nbsp;Mashuk, then [[Kislovodsk]], [[Yessentuki]], and [[Zheleznovodsk]].<ref>

During [[World War II]] the German [[Wehrmacht]] temporarily occupied Pyatigorsk. The [[Einsatzkommando]]&nbsp;12 of [[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe]]&nbsp;D had its headquarters in Pyatigorsk in 1942.<ref>
