==History==

===Founding and early history===

The history of Sloviansk dates back to 1645 when Russian Tsar [[Alexis of Russia|Alexei Romanov]] founded a [[Zasechnaya cherta|border fortress]] named Tor<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Горбунов-Посадов|first=М.М.|date=2020|title=БОЛЬШАЯ СОЮЗНАЯ ЭНЦИКЛОПЕДИЯ|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.22184/978.5.94836.575.6.82.87|journal=Проектирование цифрового будущего.

[[File:Станция Славянск в конце XIX века.jpg|thumb|200px|left| Sloviansk in the late 19th century]]

As several salt lakes were located close by, the town soon became a major producer of [[salt]]. During the sixteenth century, salt production was the principal local industry. In 1784, the city was renamed Slovenske, and a decade later, Sloviansk (Slavyansk).

In 1827, military doctor A. Yakovlev was the first to use mud treatment and bathing in Lake Ropne to treat sick soldiers. Four years later, a military hospital of 200 beds was opened near the lake, where mud therapy was used. In 1832, the first resort was established on the shores of Lake Ropne.<ref name=autogenerated4>Славянск // Курорты: энциклопедический словарь / редколл., гл. ред. Е. И. Чазов.

=== 20th century ===

[[File:Открытка Славянска №16.jpg|thumb|200px|left| Sloviansk in the early 20th century]]

In April 1918, troops loyal to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] briefly took control of Sloviansk.<ref>{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.istpravda.com.ua/short/2018/04/18/152320/ 100 years ago Bakhmut and the rest of Donbass liberated], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (18 April 2018)</ref> Sloviansk was then, along with the rest of Ukraine, incorporated into the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]].

In [[World War II]], the city was occupied by [[Nazi Germany|Nazi Germans]] on 28 October 1941. In December 1941, the [[SS]] [[Einsatzkommando#Einsatzkommando 4b|Einsatzkommando 4b]] murdered more than a thousand Jews who lived in Sloviansk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://yahadmap.org/#village/slovyansk-donetsk-ukraine.271|title = Yahad - in Unum}}</ref> The [[Red Army]] temporarily expelled the Nazi occupiers on 17 February 1943. Germans retook it on 1 March 1943. The Red Army finally liberated Sloviansk on 6 September 1943.

Salt extraction in Sloviansk in turn gave rise to salt refining and packaging, soda and other chemical manufacturing. By 1972 there were 18 related enterprises in the city, including plastics and the making of vinyl records.<ref name="Encyclopedia"/> Sloviansk reached its peak population of 143,000 in 1987. Sloviansk would remain as part of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] until its dissolution in 1991, after which the city became part of an independent Ukraine.<ref name="Encyclopedia"/>

=== Siege of Sloviansk ===
{{Main|Siege of Sloviansk}}

The [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]] for the most part passed Sloviansk by, with no large-scale gatherings or events in the city, and polls showing people in the east of Ukraine to be largely opposed to the Maidan movement in Kyiv.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://m.politnavigator.net/70-zhitelejj-donbassa-po-prezhnemu-schitayut-evromajjdan-gosudarstvennym-perevorotom-video.html|title= 70% жителей Донбасса по-прежнему считают Евромайдан государственным переворотом  |language= ru |trans-title= 70 % of the residents of Donbass still think Euromaidan was an overthrow of government|date= 20 November 2014 |access-date= 6 December 2023 }}</ref> However, Sloviansk would quickly become the epicentre of events following the fallout of the revolution. On 12 April 2014, in the crisis and chaos which gripped the country following the revolution's installing of the [[First Yatsenyuk government]], a reported 55 armed men, led by Russian military veteran [[Igor Girkin]], known as 'Igor Strelkov' stormed Sloviansk, quickly capturing the executive committee building, the police department, and the [[Security Service of Ukraine|SBU]] office of the city.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-11-20/who-is-igor-girkin-the-man-convicted-over-mh17-murder/101669982 | title=Igor Girkin was one of three convicted of murder over the MH17 attack and is the elusive figure behind Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine | work=ABC Australia | date=19 November 2022 | access-date=30 May 2023}}</ref><ref name="kpslov">{{cite news | url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/armed-pro-russian-extremists-seize-police-stations-in-donetsks-slavyansk-shaktarysk-fail-to-take-donetsk-prosecutors-office-343195.html | title=Armed pro-Russian extremists launch coordinated attacks in Donetsk Oblast, seize buildings and set up checkpoints | work=[[Kyiv Post]] | date=12 April 2014 | last=Rachkevych | first=Mark}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Where to go on Independence Weekend: places where free Ukraine was being born |url=https://rubryka.com/en/article/kudy-poyihaty-u-vikend-nezalezhnosti-mistsya-de-narodzhuvalas-vilna-ukrayina/}}</ref> Ukrainian Interior Minister [[Arsen Avakov (politician)|Arsen Avakov]] described the gunmen as "terrorists" and vowed to use the Ukrainian special forces to retake the buildings.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-police-idUSBREA3B04O20140412 | title=Armed men seize police department in east Ukraine: minister | work=Reuters | date=12 April 2014 | access-date=12 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27000700 | title=Gunmen seize Ukraine police station in Sloviansk | work=[[BBC News]] | date=12 April 2014 | access-date=12 April 2014}}</ref> On 13 April 2014, there were reports of fighting between the gunmen and Ukrainian troops, with casualties reported on both sides.<ref name=BBC27008026>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-27008026|title=Ukraine crisis: Casualties in Sloviansk gun battles|work=BBC News|date=13 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/ukraine-masked-gunmen-storm-police-station-091205681.html|title=Ukraine Army Launches 'Anti-Terror' Operation|publisher=Sky News via Yahoo!

Initially, the pro-Russia rebels enjoyed strong support, with the [[New York Times]] reporting: "''Thousands of residents thronged a large square in front of City Hall to welcome the pro-Russian putsch, chanting “Russia, Russia” and posing for photographs with gunmen they hailed as their saviors from the fascists who had seized power in Kiev with the February ouster of President Victor F.

Elected mayor of Sloviansk [[Nelya Shtepa]] gave a series of contradictory statements on her support for the pro-Russia side, and was then taken captive by the pro-Russia side. Shtepa would be one of several high-profile detainments during rebel control of Sloviansk.

However, the referendums were not monitored, or endorsed, by any international observers, or organisations, and their results almost universally unrecognised in the west. Russia issued a statement saying they 'respected' the results of the referendums, but stopped short of recognising them.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2014-05-11 |title=Ukraine rebels hold referendums in Donetsk and Luhansk |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27360146 |access-date=2023-06-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=2014-05-12 |title=Russia respect decision to split from Ukraine |language=en-GB|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/05/12/311808832/separatists-vote-to-split-from-ukraine-russia-respects-decision|access-date=2023-06-10}}</ref>

Fighting intensified throughout May, as Ukrainian forces escalated their 'ATO' (Anti-Terror Operation) to retake the city, with a Ukrainian military helicopter shot down at the start of the month, and multiple casualties reported in fighting on both sides.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2014-05-05 |title=Ukraine soldiers killed in renewed Sloviansk fighting |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27280814 |access-date=2023-06-01}}</ref> May would also see escalating civilian casualties in Sloviansk, as Ukrainian forces began their assault on the city. On 5 May, 30-year-old Irina Boevets was killed by a stray Ukrainian bullet, as she stepped out on her balcony. [[The Guardian]] at the time reported these civilian deaths as "fuelling pro-Russian sentiment".<ref>{{Cite news |date=2014-05-07 |title=Ukraine soldiers killed in renewed Sloviansk fighting |language=en-GB |work=Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/07/coffins-anger-ukraine-separatists-unrest |access-date=2023-06-03}}</ref> Fighting between sides would wage in May, with increasing intensity. A follow-up referendum to the referendum on 11 May had been planned for 18 May, giving voters the option of joining Russia, however this was abandoned due to the escalation of fighting. On 29 May 2014, a Ukrainian helicopter carrying fourteen Ukrainian special service soldiers, including General [[Serhiy Kulchytsky|Serhiy Kulchytskiy]] – the head of combat and special training for Ukraine's National Guard, crashed after being shot down by militants near Sloviansk.

As June went on, it became clear that the pro-Russia side were losing the battle for Sloviansk, beset by a number of problems, including infighting, with enmity between 'people's mayor' Ponomarev, and Strelkov/Girkin, resulting in Strelkov/Girkin having Ponomarev arrested, and dismissed from his duties, on 12 June.<ref name="Guardian"/> Ukrainian forces further stepped up their shelling of Sloviansk in June.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/shelling-in-slaviansk-idUSRTR3UFQN|title=Shelling in Slaviansk|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=18 June 2014|access-date=6 June 2023}}</ref> Sloviansk was ultimately held by Russian-backed rebels for nearly three months, from mid-April until 5 July 2014, during which time fighting between the rebels and the Ukrainian army escalated, along with shelling of civilian areas of the city, with both military and civilian casualties.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/obama-ukraine-vulnerable-russian-military-domination/27603145.html|title=Obama: Ukraine 'Vulnerable' To Russian 'Military Domination'|website=[[RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty]]|date=11 March 2016 |language=en|access-date=22 January 2019}}</ref> In late June, the Ukrainian army started advancing on Sloviansk, taking strategically significant locationed, including the Karachun Mountains.

General Serhiy Krivonos, Deputy Secretary of the [[National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine]], said in 2020 that the Ukrainian Army was aware of the movement of Girkin's columns out of Sloviansk but did not attack the columms:

<blockquote>''Having some information from our sources from Sloviansk and [[Kramatorsk]], we understood that they [the separatists] would come out. This understanding was clearly formed between 2 and 3 July. And already on the 4th it was clear that they would leave that night from 4 to 5 July. We actively conducted reconnaissance and gave coordinates directly on the night movement of the column, and on the daytime location of the enemy in Kramatorsk, and then on the exit of Girkin's columns from Kramatorsk. These coordinates were given. There was no implementation of [an attack on] these coordinates.''<ref>{{Cite news |last=Свобода |first=Радіо |date=2020-07-06 |title=Ми давали координати колон, реалізації не було – Кривонос про вихід бойовиків Гіркіна зі Слов'янська |language=uk |work=Радіо Свобода |url=https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-kryvonos-pro-vyhid-hirkina/30708379.html |access-date=2023-12-08}}</ref></blockquote>

A series of incidents, and a difficult ongoing living situation had resulted in support for the pro-Russian rebels eroding in the near three months that Sloviansk was under their control. The New York Times reported that 'many of the same people' who had once supported the pro-Russia rebels 'rushed into the same square to greet Ukrainian military trucks as soldiers handed out free food. Virtually nobody now admits to having supported the separatists.' Konstantin Batozsky, an aide to the Kyiv-appointed governor of the Donetsk region, which included Sloviansk, stated of the people of Sloviansk: “They are happy to welcome whoever gives them food.” <ref name="NYT1"/>

=== Aftermath of the siege and decommunization ===

Following Ukraine's recapture of Sloviansk in July 2014, Ukrainian authorities began a 'hunt' for collaborators, setting up a hotline encouraging residents of the city to inform on those who had 'collaborated with pro-Russian rebels'. There were further discoveries of 'mass graves'. The New York Times reported at this time "There is no mood of joyous celebration at what Ukrainian officials trumpet as the city’s “liberation.” Anger and animosity bubbles just below the calm surface. In each workplace, everyone knows who did what during rebel rule, creating poisonous currents of suspicion."<ref name="NYT1"/> The population of Sloviansk had fallen to around 80,000 at this time.

In 2015, as part of Ukraine's process of [[decommunization]], the fate of Sloviansk's statue of [[Lenin]], in the city's central square, became a topic of heated debate at council meetings. Large factions from Ukrainian ultra-national groups [[Svoboda (political party)|Svoboda]] and the [[Right Sector]] attended these meetings, in support of the removal / destruction of the statue. There were also locals in favour of keeping the statue, with a petition of 4,500 signatures supporting the Lenin statue remaining. No consensus had been reached, when in the early hours of June 3, Right Sector militants tore the statue down.<ref>{{cite news|title=Goodbye, Lenin: how a weighty symbol of the Soviet past divided a Ukrainian city|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/21/goodbye-lenin-ukraine-nationalists-statue-battle-sloviansk | date=21 June 2015|access-date=2 June 2023}}</ref> Also in 2015, a plaque to the memory of [[Volodymyr Ivanovych Rybak|Volodymyr Rybak]], a Ukrainian politician killed by pro-Russian rebels in 2014, was placed in the town center.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://empr.media/news/conflict-zone/remembering-volodymyr-rybak-a-year-since-the-murder/|title=Remembering Volodymyr Rybak: a year since the murder|date=18 April 2015|website=EMPR: Russia - Ukraine war news, latest Ukraine updates|language=en-US|access-date=18 April 2020}}</ref>

Although war continued in parts of Donbas, there were no notable incidents in Sloviansk following its recapture by Ukrainian forces in July 2014, until 2022. In 2016, the city was visited by [[Orlando Bloom]] in his role as a [[UNICEF]] goodwill ambassador.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/article/guide/people/orlando-bloom-makes-surprise-visit-to-ukraine-video-412936.html|title=Orlando Bloom makes surprise visit to Ukraine|date=29 April 2016|access-date=21 November 2023}}</ref> The population of Sloviansk would recover in the years up to 2022, to pre-2014 level.<ref name="Encyclopedia"/>

* Before the war in 2014, Sloviansk was an important industrial and health resort center, providing spa treatments and mud baths using mud from the bottom of salt lakes located nearby, and attracting tourists from across Ukraine and beyond. After sustaining damage in 2014, some of the city's resort facilities were repaired, and operated until active war broke out in Sloviansk again in 2022. As of 2023, none of Sloviansk's spa resorts or tourist facilities are in operation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://discover-ukraine.info/places/eastern-ukraine/donetsk/1622 |title= Discover Ukraine |access-date= 8 December 2023}}</ref>

== Transport ==
[[File:Sloviansk Railway Station2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Sloviansk railway station]]]]
Sloviansk is a nexus of a number of railways and roads. The city is served by three railway passenger stations: Slovianskyi Resort (in the northeast), ‘Mashchormet’ (at the junction), and '[[Sloviansk railway station|Sloviansk]]' (the main station, west of the junction, on the southwest side of the city). Three railway lines leave the city in directions of [[Lozova]], [[Lyman, Ukraine|Lyman]] and [[Kramatorsk]]. The local population is served by a [[trolleybus]] network consisting of two permanent routes and one summer route. [[Marshrutka]]s are widely used.

The [[Highway M03 (Ukraine)|M03]] goes by the edge of Sloviansk. In early 2015, Ukraine lost control of the section of this from [[Debaltsevo]] on, then in early 2023 Ukraine lost control of the section from [[Soledar]] to Debaltsevo. [[Highway H20 (Ukraine)|H20]] leaves from the city toward [[Mariupol]], via Kramatorsk, Kostiantynivka, Donetsk, and [[Volnovakha]]. Ukraine lost control of part of this highway, around Donetsk, in 2014. The first part of 2022 saw fierce fighting on or around the highway, and by summer of 2022, Ukraine had lost control of the H20 highway, from around Donetsk onto Mariupol.
