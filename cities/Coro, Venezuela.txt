'''Coro''' is the capital of [[Falcón|Falcón State]] and the second oldest city in [[Venezuela]] (after [[Cumaná]]). It was founded on July 26, 1527, by [[Juan de Ampíes]] as '''Santa Ana de Coro'''. It was historically known as '''Neu-[[Augsburg]]''' (from 1528 to 1546) by the German [[Welsers]], and Coro by the Spanish colonizers and Venezuelans, the city and buildings were built during the Spanish Empire. It is established at the south of the [[Paraguaná Peninsula]] in a coastal plain, flanked by the [[Médanos de Coro National Park]] to the north and the [[Sierra de Falcón|Sierra de Coro]] to the south, at a few kilometers from its port ([[La Vela de Coro]]) in the [[Caribbean Sea]] at a point equidistant between the Ensenada de La Vela and Golfete de Coro.

It has a wide cultural tradition that comes from being the urban settlement founded by the Spanish conquerors who colonized the interior of the continent. As '''Neu-Augsburg''', it was the first [[German colonial projects before 1871|German colony]] in the Americas under the [[Welser family]] of [[Augsburg]] (from 1528 to 1546). It was then the first capital of the Spanish [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]] (1546-1578) and head of the first bishop founded in [[South America]] in 1531. The precursor movement of the independence and of vindication of the dominated classes in Venezuela originated in this region; it is also considered to be the cradle of the Venezuelan federalist movement in the republican era.

Thanks to the city's history, culture and its well-preserved Colonial architecture, "Coro and its port La Vela" was designated in 1993 as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Coro {{!}} Venezuela {{!}} History, Climate & Economy {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Coro |access-date=2023-10-18 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> Since 2005 it is on the UNESCO's [[List of World Heritage in Danger]].<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/658/ UNESCO official website.]</ref>

== Toponymy ==
At its founding the town was called Santa Ana de Coro (there is now an unsuccessful campaign to reinstate the colonial name of the city) in the Spanish style that named new cities in America according to the Catholic calendar, accompanied by a name of Indian origin. According to the tradition the word ''coro'' derives from the [[Caquetio language|Caquetio]] word ''curiana'', meaning "place of winds".<ref>karen Larkins, ''Smithsonian Magazine'', March 2009, [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/Endangered-Cultural-Treasures-Port-City-of-Coro-Venezuela.html Endangered Site: Port City of Coro, Venezuela] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617205217/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/Endangered-Cultural-Treasures-Port-City-of-Coro-Venezuela.html |date=2012-06-17 }}</ref> However, according to the authoritative [[Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española|DRAE]] Spanish dictionary, the word ''coro'' in its second meaning means "wind of the northwest", and comes from the Latin ''caurus''.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

== History ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2023}}
=== Early history ===
{{Main|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Klein-Venedig}}

[[File:Hermita en Coro.JPG|thumb|Colonial hermitage in Coro]]
The city was founded on July 26, 1527, by [[Juan de Ampués|Juan Martín de Ampués]], with the name of [[Saint Anne|Santa Ana]] de Coro. Ampíes covenanted to respect the authority of the Native chief Manaure highest authority of the natives of the region, the [[Caquetio people]], This covenant is broken abruptly in 1529 with the landing at the city's first Governor and Captain General [[Ambrosius Ehinger]] representing the [[Welser]], an [[Augsburg]] banking and trading family. The family received the [[Province of Venezuela]] (as ''[[Klein-Venedig]]'') from the emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] for exploration, founding cities and exploitation of the resources of this vast territory that stretched from [[Cabo de la Vela]] ([[Guajira Peninsula]]) to Maracapana (near the city of [[Barcelona, Anzoátegui]]). From Coro emerged multiple expeditions to the Venezuelan and Colombian [[Llanos]], the [[Andes]] and the [[Orinoco]] River in search of [[El Dorado]], which allowed the conquerors to explore these vast territories. The government of the Welsers ends in 1545 for breach of contract and conflict of interests between them and the Spanish conquistadors who explored the territory from other focal points of the Spanish Empire in [[Latin America|America]]. The city is in its early days a "beachhead" or outpost of the Spanish during the conquest and colonization in the western and central Venezuela. From them left the expeditions of exploration and founding of new towns.

Santa Ana de Coro lost the political capital of the [[Venezuela Province]] (also known as the '''Coro Province''' in official documents of the time) in 1578 to [[Caracas]], motivated by repeated invasions of [[Pirate|pirates]] ([[Preston Somers Expedition]] was one) and especially to the harshness of its climate. Finally it was no longer the seat of the bishopric in 1636.

=== Fall and rise ===
During the seventeenth century Coro was hit by a hurricane and invasions of pirates, to the point where it appeared in the charts of English and French of the time with the title of "destroyed." However, these calamities left intact the countryside, with its productive power, which allowed it to recover slowly. Thus, in the late 18th and early 19th century reaches its colonial peak. Precisely from this period are the best preserved civilian buildings in the city.

In 1795 a slave uprising occurs, and generally dominated social classes in the Sierra de Coro, led by the free [[zambo]] [[José Leonardo Chirino]], which was aimed at the elimination of slavery and the establishment of the republican regime known for the time as "the French law". The movement, which would be the forerunner in the independence process would end in defeat, the capture and killing of rebel leader.

=== Independence ===
In 1806 an expedition landed in the port of La Vela de Coro led by [[Francisco de Miranda]].  It was intended to be liberating, but was not greeted with enthusiasm by the locals.  The expedition is still important as the precursor of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] and in particular for bringing the [[Tricolour (flag)|tricolor]], eventually adopted as the [[flag of Gran Colombia]]. It is now the basis for the official flag of three American republics, [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Ecuador]]. The port of La Vela de Coro was where it was raised for the first time in Venezuela.

During the beginning of the [[Venezuelan War of Independence]], Coro, [[Maracaibo]] and [[Guiana Shield|Guiana]] did not comply with the provisions of the [[Junta Suprema de Caracas]] on April 19, 1810, remaining loyal to Spanish rule. Subsequently, formed a bulwark of the Spanish Empire to land on its coasts the troops that end up destroying the [[First Republic of Venezuela]]. In 1821, finally the [[Coro Province]] incorporates to the process of independence, with the capture of the city by the troops led by the heroine [[Josefa Camejo]] and a group of [[patriotism|patriots]] who came a long time plotting. By the time the General [[Rafael Urdaneta]] invades from Maracaibo commanding the Grancolombian army, and the city had been released a few days earlier for the Coro army commanded by Camejo.

The [[War of Independence of Venezuela|War of Independence]] and later the civil wars of the 19th century (including the [[Federal War]] that began in Coro) leaving the city deserted and destroyed its field, which plunged her into a period of decline that would recover the half- well into the 20th century with the construction of [[oil]] refineries in the [[Paraguaná Peninsula]] and the changes in Venezuela following the passage of a rural to an urban and oil country.

Since the early 50s Coro was declared a National Heritage.

== Geography ==
[[File:Medanos de C..jpg|thumb|Sand dunes of [[Médanos de Coro National Park]]]]
Coro is located at north of the [[Coro region]], transition between the [[Venezuelan Coastal Range]] and the [[Cordillera de Mérida]]. Located on a coastal plain of [[xerophytic|xerophyte]] vegetation (19 msn) covering the entire western [[Falcón]] state and reaches its narrowest point just in the city, closing a few miles east of Coro by foothills of the [[Sierra de Falcón]]. To the north lies the [[Médanos Isthmus]], named for it found in a formation of dunes or sand fields that have been formed by persistent [[trade wind]]s and ocean currents. The isthmus connects the [[Paraguaná Peninsula]] with the mainland. at south of the city are the foothills of the Sierra de Falcón.

=== Climate ===
Due to its extremely high [[Evapotranspiration|potential evapotranspiration]], Coro has a [[semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''BSh'') despite receiving an average of approximately {{convert|452|mm|in|0|disp=or}} of rainfall per year over 50.1 precipitation days. Humidity remains at a similar level year-round. The highest rainfall occurs between October and December, while March is the driest month. The average [[temperature]] is {{convert|28.9|°C|°F|1}}, with minimum temperatures of {{convert|23|°C|°F}} and maximum {{convert|36|°C|°F|1}}. The city is sunny, averaging over 3100 hours of sunshine a year, with January being the sunniest month.<ref name="NOAA" /> It is characterized by strong winds that can register speeds of {{convert|35|km/h|mph knot}}.

On 29 April 2015, Coro recorded a temperature of {{convert|43.6|C|F|abbr=on}}, which is the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Venezuela.<ref name=wu20151021>{{cite web |last1=Masters |first1=Jeff |url=https://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/sixteen-nationalterritorial-alltime-extreme-heat-records-set-in-2015.html |title=Sixteen National/Territorial All-Time Extreme Heat Records Set in 2015 |publisher=Wunderground |date=27 January 2016 |access-date=19 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204182639/https://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/sixteen-nationalterritorial-alltime-extreme-heat-records-set-in-2015.html |archive-date=4 February 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Coro has never recorded a temperature below {{convert|18.9|C|F|abbr=on}}.

== Politics and government ==

Because of its status as capital of the state, Coro is the urban center around which political life of [[Falcón]]. It is the political and administrative capital, where is the seat of state government, among others, the Regional Council Legislature, the Governor, the courts and the seat (rector) of the Universidad Nacional Experimental Francisco de Miranda, as well as, the vast majority of representations of national government bodies. It is also the capital of Miranda municipality, to which are added the municipal agencies.

The governor and the municipality is currently led by supporters of President Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías in a Venezuela's political map is also mostly covered by governors and mayors Chávez trend (MVR). However, in the December 2007 elections, the referendum on constitutional reform proposal, this party and political groups who accompanied him at the time, were the first defeat after eight years of successive electoral successes. Coro margin than in the rejection of the reform ("NO") was 57.08%. In relation to the regional elections of November 2008 the Mayor was obtained by the ruling party (PSUV), although in the city its candidate for governor of the state got fewer votes, when the city was characterized by votes ruling party.

In the September 2010 elections to the National Assembly Coro and the rest of the municipalities of Falcón and the Miranda municipality formed the circuit number 3 of the state. For the ruling party [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela|PSUV]]'s bid was for retired Gen. Melvin Lopez Hidalgo, while the table of democratic unity MUD was for Gregorio Graterol, former candidate for governor of the state. With more than 52% of the vote, the opposition candidate for MUD Gregorio Graterol wins the seat on the circuit assembly, representing the fourth consecutive defeat of [[Chavismo]] in the city (the 2007 reform, the government in 2008, amendment in 2009 and parliamentary elections in 2010)

The city has inherited a monumental architecture of the colonial and republican times features typical of the [[Andalusia]]n architecture (southern Spain), with materials and techniques used by Native Americans based in the mud, like [[adobe]] and [[Wattle and daub|wattle]], which gives it a unique personality. Equally characteristic has a certain pattern that combines traditional Spanish checkerboard layout with an irregular shape typical of medieval [[Germany|German]] cities, product of the period in which the city was the seat of the domain of [[Welser]]. In the central town, some streets end abruptly, breaking the regularity of the Spanish checkerboard. Ambrosius Alfinger (German of the house of the Welsers and first Governor of the Province of Venezuela) restructures the layout of the streets based on the original layout of the founding of the city.

With its earthen constructions unique in the Caribbean, Coro is the surviving example of the rich fusion of indigenous traditions with the Spanish [[Mudéjar]] architectural techniques and irregular shape of German Welser architecture. It is one of the first colonial cities, was founded in 1527, and its colonial architecture prevails until today. Over 600 buildings have been appointed in Coro as heritage.

The historic centre remains characteristics typical of a city of the 18th and 19th centuries, with cobbled stone streets and colonial buildings. This is an important colonial city resort and the largest complex of colonial temples in Venezuela. It contains a variety of [[museum]]s with a broad representation of Catholic iconography or national historical value, so it is called "la ciudad museo". For these reasons it is declared, along with its nearby port of [[La Vela de Coro]], a [[World Heritage Site]] on December 9, 1993, by [[Unesco]] in meeting held in the [[Colombia]]n city of [[Cartagena de Indias]].

Since 2005 Coro has been officially listed as an "endangered" World Heritage Site (see [[List of World Heritage in Danger]]). Climate change in Venezuela, in particular heavy rains, have caused significant damage to its rich architecture.  Coro's traditional buildings were built with techniques based on the use of earth (adobe, and earth reinforced with a plant structure in a technique called "bahareque"). Many of these buildings are vulnerable to heavy rains, as in its natural state earth is a material of low resistance to moisture.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/21/ World Heritage Earthen Architecture Programme]</ref>

As well as the damage from rains between November 2004 and February 2005, the built environment had, according to UNESCO, been adversely affected by the construction of inappropriate walls and fences. There has also been concern about the construction of a new monument, beach walkways and a gateway to the city in the port of La Vela de Coro: these could have a considerable impact on the value of the site.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/658/threats/ Coro and its Port], UNESCO</ref>

In 2018 it was noted that while information provided by the "State Party" (i.e. Venezuela) demonstrated satisfactory advances in the implementation of many corrective measures, further information and actions were needed to ensure that the key issues previously identified as affecting the property have been adequately addressed.<ref name="UNESCO2018">{{Cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/soc/3777 |title=Coro and its Port (Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of))}}</ref>

=== Monuments and tourist attractions ===

From its historic colonial architecture to its diverse landscapes, Coro provides various forms of tourist attraction. In the extreme northeast of the city are the Médanos de Coro National Park, large dunes that are the only desert in Venezuela. They are located along the road that runs between the colonial area of the city to the port of La Vela de Coro. The colonial town, a World Heritage Site, preserves a typical urban landscape of the 18th and 19th centuries, with its cobbled streets and hundreds of historic and traditional buildings. Some architectures reflects a [[Mudéjar]] style, while others reflect the cultural influence of the [[Netherlands]] through the colony of Curaçao. In the city there are interesting Catholic and secular buildings, that were the scene of numerous events of historic significance, since the early republican period. Probably the architectural influences of Coro are unique.

Among the buildings and places of interest highlights include:

;[[Cathedral of Coro]]

Since the creation of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Coro|Diocese of Coro]] by the papal bull of July 21, 1531, it directed the building of the Cathedral of St. Anne, one of the temples of Coro, and in 1567 the cathedral was sacked by the Corsair [[Francis Drake]]. The current structure dates from 1583 and was completed by the end of the 17th century, making it the oldest Catholic church in [[Tierra Firma]].

;Casa de las Ventanas de Hierro

Magnificent mansion built in the 17th century by '''Don José Francisco Garcés de la Colina'''. This is a house that has a portal that rises to more than eight feet (2.4&nbsp;m) high, and so named because of the large windows protected by a wrought iron structure that was imported from [[Andalusia]].
[[File:Iglesia de San Francisco, Coro.jpg|thumb|200px|Colonial Church of San Francisco and diocesan museum.]]

;Iglesia y Convento de San Francisco
