'''Riobamba''' ({{IPA|es|rjoˈβamba}}, full name '''San Pedro de Riobamba'''; [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]]: ''Rispampa'') is the capital of [[Chimborazo Province]] in central [[Ecuador]], and is located in the [[Chambo River]] Valley of the [[Andes]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.galenfrysinger.com/riobamba_ecuador.htm |title=Riobamba, Ecuador – Travel Photos by Galen R Frysinger, Sheboygan, Wisconsin |website=www.galenfrysinger.com}}</ref> It is located {{cvt|200|km|mi}} south of Ecuador's capital [[Quito]] and situated at an elevation of 2,754&nbsp;m.

The city is an important regional transport center and a stop on the [[Pan-American Highway]], which runs through Ecuador. Riobamba is one of the largest cities in the central portion of Ecuador's Sierra region.

==Name==
Riobamba takes its name from a combination of ''rio'', the Spanish word for "river", and ''rispampa'', the [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] word for "plain."

== History ==
The region surrounding Riobamba was inhabited by the [[Puruhá]] nation before the advance of the [[Inca Empire]] during the late 15th century. The Puruha fiercely resisted the Inca efforts to conquer the north of today's Ecuador. The Inca [[Huayna Capac]] had to make an alliance in order to pacify the tribes who sided with Condorazo, the general of the Puruha nation.

He allied with the Schyris confederation, also known as the Caran-Quitu people, believed to have developed the [[Kingdom of Quito]] in the northern Andes. The 18th-century Jesuit historian [[Juan de Velasco]] described this confederation as a group of tribes ruled by the Duchicela dynasty. Huayna Capac took the princess Paccha as his wife and gave special treatment and social status privileges to the higher castes of these new subjects. The son of this alliance was [[Atahualpa]], who served as the last king of the Inca.

Following the Spanish invasion and conquest of the Inca and their allies, Riobamba was founded on 15 August 1534 in the San Miguel plains by [[Diego de Almagro]]. It is considered the first city to be established in what is modern-day Ecuador.<ref name=Leon>Leon, P., 1998, ''The Discovery and Conquest of Peru, Chronicles of the New World Encounter,'' edited and translated by Cook and Cook, Durham: Duke University Press, {{ISBN|9780822321460}}</ref>{{rp|341}} In 1563, the city became part of the [[Spanish Empire]]'s newly formed [[Royal Audience of Quito]].

Although the city was completely destroyed by an [[1797 Riobamba earthquake|earthquake in 1797]], it was rebuilt a few years later {{cvt|14|km|mi}} from its original location. The second site was near a village named [[Cajabamba, Ecuador|Cajabamba]] on the plains of San Antonio de Aguíscate. The city still retains much architecture from the Spanish colonial period. During the [[Ecuadorian War of Independence]], Riobamba first declared independence on November 11, 1820, but was soon retaken by Crown forces.  In 1822 the city became part of [[Gran Colombia]], which gained independence from Spain that year. In 1830 the Republic of Ecuador established its own independence as a nation.

===20th century to present===
The Monumental Raúl Dávalos, a 13,000-person capacity bullring, opened here in 1952. In 2011 the nation voted by referendum to prohibit matadors killing the bulls in such ''[[Bullfighting|corrida]]s'', a policy also followed by Portugal. This has resulted in a dramatic decline in related tourism, with a substantial loss in revenues, especially in Quito.<ref name="corrida">{{cite web |url=https://www.efe.com/efe/english/entertainment/quito-banned-matadors-from-killing-bulls-loses-millions-of-dollars-a-year/50000264-3356292 |title=Quito banned matadors from killing bulls, loses millions of dollars a year |author=Agencia EFE |date=19 August 2017 |access-date=8 July 2020}}</ref>

On 20 November 2002, seven people were killed and hundreds wounded from a series of explosions at the munitions depot at the Galapagos Brigade arsenal in Riobamba. Such was the force of the explosion that many residents said they first thought there had been an earthquake or volcanic eruption. Windows were blown out more than 1.5 kilometres from the arsenal, and many of the injured suffered lacerations from flying shards of glass.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/22/world/blast-at-ecuador-munitions-dump-kills-8.html |title=Blast at Ecuador Munitions Dump Kills 8 - New York Times |website=google.com  |access-date=3 February 2022 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120723150445/http://google.com/search?q=cache:r1JWtIGams0J:www.nytimes.com/2002/11/22/world/blast-at-ecuador-munitions-dump-kills-8.html+2002+munitions+riobamba+grenade+quito&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk |archive-date=23 July 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>

According to Colonel [[Arturo Cadena]], a military spokesman in [[Quito]], the initial explosion occurred during maintenance work inside the dump. In April 2003, the army published its final investigatory report of the explosion. It concluded that the [[Santa Barbara munitions factory]] was directly responsible for the explosion, which the army classified as an accident.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

== Geography ==
