== Etymology ==

Faisalabad was formerly (until 1977) known as Lyallpur. When founded in 1890 it was named after [[James Broadwood Lyall|Sir James Broadwood Lyall]], the British lieutenant governor of the Punjab.<ref>{{cite book |first=Ian |last=Talbot |year=2020 |title=The History of British Diplomacy in Pakistan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kwIPEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT275 |publisher=Routledge |page=275|isbn=9781000326703 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Kavita |last=Puri |year=2019 |title=Partition Voices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=emCWDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT108 |publisher=Bloomsbury |page=108|isbn=9781408899069 }}</ref> It became headquarters of the Lower Chenab colony and in 1898 was incorporated as a municipality.<ref>Britannica {{cite news|title=Faisalabad|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Faisalabad|newspaper= Britannica}}</ref>

In September 1977, the city of Lyallpur was renamed "Faisalabad" by the [[Government of Pakistan]] for [[King of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabian king]] [[Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]] and [[Pakistan–Saudi Arabia relations|his kingdom's long relationship]] with Pakistan and its people.<ref>The Express Tribune {{cite news|title=From Lyallpur to Faisalabad: the city of eight bazaars|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/2340127/from-lyallpur-to-faisalabad-the-city-of-eight-bazaars|newspaper= The Express Tribune|date=24 Jan 2022}}</ref>

===Early settlements===
The region encompassing modern day Faisalabad district was originally inhabited by a number of forest-dwelling tribes.<ref name="Punjab Canal Colonies"/> It is believed these early settlements belonged to the ancient districts of [[Jhang]] and [[Sandalbar]], and included the area between [[Shahdara Bagh|Shahdara]] to Shorekot and [[Sangla Hill]] to [[Toba Tek Singh]].<ref name="TUF history" /> The shrine of [[Baba Noor Shah Wali]] was erected in the area in the 1600s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://pakvoter.org/wp-content/pdfs/Punjab%20Local%20Government%20Elections%202016/Faisalabad.pdf |title=Local government elections 2020 Faisalabad |access-date=11 May 2020 |archive-date=10 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231010152122/https://pakvoter.org/wp-content/pdfs/Punjab%20Local%20Government%20Elections%202016/Faisalabad.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Development===
At the conclusion of the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]] in 1849, the entire [[Punjab region]] became administered as [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab province]], firstly by the [[East India Company]] and after 1858 as part of the [[British Raj]].<ref name=Stein>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QY4zdTDwMAQC&pg=GBS.PA107|last=Stein|first=Burton|title=A History of India|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-2351-1|page=107}} Quote: "When the formal rule of the Company was replaced by the direct rule of the British Crown in 1858, ...."</ref><ref name=Duke>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UMMECgAAQBAJ&pg=PT71|last=Lowe|first=Lisa|title=The Intimacies of Four Continents|date= 2015|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-7564-7|page=71}} Quote: "...

=== Independence ===
In August 1947, following three decades of nationalist struggles, India and Pakistan achieved independence. The British agreed to [[Partition of India|partition British India]] into two sovereign states – Pakistan with a [[Islam|Muslim]] majority, and India with a [[Hindu]] majority. However, more Muslims remained in India than what governing authorities believed would assimilate into Pakistan.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/partition1947_01.shtml | title=The Hidden Story of Partition and its Legacies | work=British History | publisher=BBC | date=3 March 2011 | access-date=4 December 2015 | author=Crispin Bates, Phd}}</ref> The partitioning led to a mass migration of an estimated 10 million people which made it the largest mass migration in human history.<ref name="BBC" /> The Punjab province was divided into [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab, West Pakistan]] and [[Punjab, India]].

Faisalabad lies in the rolling flat plains of northeast Punjab, at {{convert|186|m}} above sea level. The city proper comprises approximately {{convert|1326|km2}} while the district encompasses more than {{convert|16000|km2}}. The Chenab River flows about {{convert|30|km}}, and the [[Ravi River]] meanders {{convert|40|km}} to the southeast. The lower Chenab canal provides water to 80% of cultivated lands making it the main source of irrigation. Faisalabad is bound on the north by [[Chiniot]] and [[Sheikhupura]], on the east by Sheikhupura and Sahiwal, on the south by Sahiwal and Toba Tek Singh and on the west by Jhang.<ref name="CDG: Geography">{{cite web|title=CDG Faisalabad|url=http://www.faisalabad.gov.pk/Home/CityProfileDetail/2|website=www.faisalabad.gov.pk|publisher=City District Government Faisalabad|access-date=7 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505070526/http://www.faisalabad.gov.pk/Home/CityProfileDetail/2|archive-date=5 May 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The soil consists of young stratified silt loam or very fine sand loam which makes the subsoil weak in structure with common kankers at only five feet. The course of the rivers within Faisalabad is winding and often subject to frequent alternations. In the rainy season, the currents are very strong. This leads to high floods in certain areas which do last for a number of days. The [[Rakh]] and [[Gogera]] canals have encouraged the water levels in the district however the belt on the Ravi River has remained narrow. The river bed does include the river channels which have shifted the sand bars and low sandy [[levees]] leading to river erosion.<ref name="Nasim Akhtar"/> Faisalabad is situated at the centre of the lower [[Rechna Doab]], the area is located between the Chenab and Ravi rivers. There is a mild slope from the northeast to the southwest with an average fall of {{convert|0.2|-|0.3|m/km|abbr=off}}. The city is situated at an elevation of about {{convert|183|m}}. The topography is marked by valleys, local depression and high ground.<ref name=Kobe />

Islam is the most common religion, with a 97.22% Muslim majority according to the 1998 Pakistan census report and 2001 population data sheet.<ref name="SAS"/> People live in tight-knit joint families, although a [[nuclear family]] system is emerging due to changing socio-economic conditions.<ref name="SAS"/> Ancient culture prevails in most marriage practices in the region, as do certain restrictions related to ethnicity and tribes.

Social change in the region has been a slow process but there are indications that change has occurred as more villages are exposed to various forms of media and modernized urban communities.
