It is the largest [[metropolis]] in the [[Peruvian Amazon]], east of the Andes, as well as the [[List of cities in Peru|ninth-most populous city in Peru]]. Iquitos is the largest city in the world that cannot be reached by road that is not on an island; it is only accessible by river and air.<ref>[https://www.lonelyplanet.com/peru/amazon-basin/iquitos Lonely Planet: Iquitos]</ref>

It is known as the "capital of the Peruvian Amazon". The city is located in the Great Plains of the Amazon Basin, fed by the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], [[Nanay River|Nanay]], and [[Itaya River|Itaya]] rivers. Overall, it constitutes the [[Iquitos metropolitan area]], a conurbation of 471,993 inhabitants consisting of four districts: [[Iquitos District|Iquitos]], [[Punchana District|Punchana]], [[Belén District, Maynas|Belén]], and [[San Juan Bautista District, Maynas|San Juan Bautista]].

The area has long been inhabited by indigenous peoples. According to Spanish historical documents, Iquitos was established around 1757 as a Spanish [[Jesuit reduction]] on the banks of the Nanay River. The Jesuits gathered local Napeano ([[Yameo]]) and Iquito natives to live here, and they named it ''San Pablo de Napeanos''.

In the late 19th century, during the [[Amazon rubber boom]], the city became the center of export of rubber production from the Amazon Basin and was the headquarters of the [[Peruvian Amazon Company]] (PAC). The city's economy was highly dependent on the PAC, controlled in the nation by Peruvian businessman [[Julio César Arana]]. PAC kept indigenous workers in near slavery conditions through use of force and harsh treatment, until an investigation caused a reaction against the company. In addition, rubber seedlings had been smuggled out of the country and cultivated on plantations in Southeast Asia, undercutting prices of the Peruvian product. With the decline of the rubber industry, many workers and merchants left Iquitos.

As one of the leading cities, along with [[Manaus]], during the Amazon rubber boom (1880–1914), Iquitos was influenced by the numerous Europeans who flocked to it. Architecture and cultural institutions established during this period expressed their own traditions. An opera house and Jewish cemetery were among the institutions established.

Later in the 20th century, the city and region diversified its economy. The region exported timber, fish and its by-products, oil, minerals, and agricultural crops. It also derives revenue from tourism and related crafts. In 1999, the city consolidated its four municipalities.

== History ==

=== Early period ===
The area was inhabited for thousands of years by [[Amerindian]]s. At the time of European encounter, the Napeano and [[Iquito]] peoples occupied the area. They had small seasonal settlements and were nomadic hunter-gatherers, living in close association with the rivers. The city name of Iquitos is derived from a group of native people called Iquitos by the Spaniards. They had previously inhabited areas along the rivers [[Pastaza River|Pastaza]], Arabela, [[Tigre River|Tigre]], [[Nanay River|Nanay]], and [[Curaray River|Curaray]]. Eventually, the native Iquito migrated to the area around the rivers Nanay, Amazonas, Itaya, and the [[Lake Moronacocha]].

Between 1638 and 1769, the Iquitos and other native tribes of the Marañon rivers were obliged to settle down in various Missions (known as ''reducciones'' or reductions) founded and run by [[Jesuit]] missionaries from the Audiencia of Quito. The Jesuits settled in the major cities of the Audiencia of Quito, which was part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] at the time. During this period of nearly 130 years, 161 Jesuit missionaries worked to convert and educate the natives of the Amazon region. Among them were 63 [[criollo people|criollos]] (white ethnic Spanish colonists born in the Audencia), 43 [[Spaniard]]s, 32 [[Germans]] and [[Dutch people|Dutch]], 20 [[Italian people|Italians]], 2 [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], and 1 [[French people|Frenchman]]. Their role in South America was to convert the natives of the Amazon Basin to Christianity. The Jesuits successfully gathered the natives living along the Marañon river into various Jesuit [[Mission (station)|missions]], where they were set to work at farming and other pursuits.

Commencing in 1730, the Jesuits took 37 years to found the Iquitos missions along the Marañon River, close to the mouth of the [[Napo River|Napo]] and Amazon rivers. These were collectively known as Iquitos Missions, since all these settlements were mainly populated chiefly by the Iquitos natives of the region. The naming and foundation of all the Iquitos Missions were done by Jesuit Father [[José Bahamonde]]. He was born in [[Quito]] on 1 January 1710, accepted into the Jesuit order, and served as a missionary for decades. After [[Charles III of Spain]] suppressed and expelled the [[Society of Jesus]] from South America in 1767, Bahamonde was exiled to Italy, where he died in [[Ravenna]], Italy on 11 May 1786.

The following is a chronological list of noted Iquitos Missions founded by Bahamonde and other Jesuits:
#1730, Santa Maria de la Luz de los Iquitos "town," founded by Father Bahamonde – as recorded in the Archives of the Indies in Spain.
#1740, Juan Nepomuceno de Iquitos, founded by Father Bahamonde
#1741, Santa Bárbara de Iquitos, founded by Father Bahamonde
#1742, San Sebastián de Iquitos, founded by fathers Bahamonde and Bretano
#1748, Sagrado Corazón de Jesús de Maracanos (de Iquitos), founded by Father Bahamonde
#1754, Santa María de Iquitos, founded by Father Uriarte
#1757, San Pablo de los Napeanos, founded by Father Bahamonde
#1763 San Javier de Iquitos, founded by Father Palme
#1767 San José de Iquitos, founded by Father Uriarte. Later that year the Jesuits were expelled from South America by order of Charles III.

During the Spanish Colonial era, most of the Jesuit missions were under the jurisdiction of the [[Royal Audiencia of Quito]]. Created in 1563, it was a part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], and was transferred briefly to the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] on 27 May 1717 known as the Cedula Real of 1717 (Royal Decree of 1717). Six and a half years later, on 5 November 1723, [[Philip V of Spain]] dissolved the Viceroyalty of New Granada and reincorporated the Audiencia of Quito into the Viceroyalty of Peru. Sixteen years later [[Philip V of Spain]] decided to re-create the Viceroyalty of New Granada and to re incorporate the Audiencia of Quito through the ''Cedula Real'' (Royal Decree) dated 20 August 1739. [[Charles III of Spain]] suppressed the [[Society of Jesus]], believing them too powerful, and expelled them from South America by order dated 20 August 1767. Given the distance from Quito and the lack of roads connecting to that city, a political vacuum was developed in the area. The undefended Jesuit missions were attacked by the Brazilian [[Bandeirantes]]. In response the King of Spain on recommendation of [[Francisco Raquena]] created the [[General Command of Maynas|Government and Commandancy General of Maynas]] in 1802 to halt the invasion into the Spanish Amazon of land-hungry [[mestizo]] Portuguese [[Bandeirantes]]. In general, this amounted to the religious administration and military command of all tributaries of the Amazon river in the Amazon Basin that belonged to the [[Royal Audiencia of Quito]] in the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] being transferred again to the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. The Portuguese advance was halted at [[Tabatinga]].

=== 19th century: independence ===
In the early 19th century, following independence, Peru, [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], and Brazil had overlapping claims to the Northwestern [[Amazon Basin]], based on each country's interpretation of their colonial ''de jure'' titles. The disputed area was populated mostly by groups of nomadic Amerindian natives living in the Amazon jungle. In addition there were semi-assimilated sedentary Amerindians living with a handful of whites and mestizos, dedicated to trading in sparsely populated trading port villages that were found scattered along the river banks of the Amazon Basin. During the colonial era the disputed area known as Maynas had numerous missions administered by the Jesuits of Quito. After the Jesuits were expelled from South America, only a handful of missions survived in the 19th century as isolated trading villages. The Brazilians, by contrast, had a chain of villages along the Amazon River that stretched to its ports along the Atlantic Ocean.

Because Peru discovered that Ecuador and Colombia neglected to effectively control their Amazonian territories during their colonial era, Peru decided to back its [[de jure]] titles with [[de facto]] possession by setting up military posts in the relatively isolated trading villages and then flooding the disputed area with Peruvian colonists. The only problem lay with the expanding ambitions of Brazil, since it had slowly settled its part of the disputed area with colonists throughout its colonial era; it had a trading relationship with the Spanish-speaking trading posts and villages along the Marañon River. To neutralize Brazil from impeding Peru's planned colonization project, on 23 October 1851, Peru peacefully settled its disputes with Brazil and both countries agreed to a bilateral free navigation and friendly trade along the Amazon River.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Charles E.|date=1925|title=Settlement of Boundary Controversies Between Brazil, Colombia and Peru|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0002930000063004|journal=American Journal of International Law|volume=19|issue=3|pages=579|doi=10.1017/s0002930000063004|s2cid=246006596 |via=JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2188892}}</ref>

As a result of the Peruvian-Brazilian treaty, the Peruvian President [[Ramon Castilla]] created the Military and Political Department of Loreto on 7 January 1861 from the former Maynas territory. Castilla ordered that a fluvial port be constructed in a strategic spot on the Amazon River. After some debate, his staff chose the trading port Village of Iquitos. On 5 January 1864, three steamships of the Peruvian Navy: ''Pastaza,'' ''Próspero'' y ''Morona'', arrived in the Village of Iquitos.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lnfc.edu.pe/quienes_somos.html |title=Reseña histórica de la Institución Educativa C. de N.

This date is marked as the founding of the first fluvial Peruvian port of Iquitos by the government of Peru. A dockyard and navy factorage imported from England was immediately constructed. In time Iquitos grew so much that it was designated as the capital of the Department of Loreto on 9 November 1897. Iquitos also became the seat of a Roman Catholic [[Apostolic vicariate]].<ref>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/diqut.html "Vicariate Apostolic of Iquitos"], Catholic Hierarchy</ref> Peru was able to map out and assume ''de facto'' control of the majority of the area of the Amazon region under dispute with Ecuador and Colombia. After many skirmishes with Ecuadorian and Colombian outposts, that at times led to war, Peru settled its border with Colombia in 1922 and with Ecuador in 1942.

=== Rubber boom in the 20th century ===
Beginning in the 1900s, Iquitos became wealthy through its [[rubber]] industry throughout the [[rubber boom]]; it attracted thousands of immigrants from around the world, mostly young single men who hoped to make their fortunes in rubber. The rise of the automobile and related industries had dramatically increased the worldwide demand for rubber. Some men became merchants and bankers, and made their fortunes that way. Many of the European men married [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] women and stayed in Iquitos the rest of their lives, founding ethnically mixed families. The immigrants brought European clothing styles, music, architecture and other cultural elements to Iquitos. They established an opera house that featured European classical music.

[[File:“The Booth Pier, Iquitos.”.jpg|thumb|The Booth pier at Iquitos c. 1912]]

There were twenty-five different commercial houses dealing with rubber at Iquitos in the year 1900.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Capelo |first1=Joaquín |title=Razon general de precios y datos comerciales de la plaza de Iquitos |date=1900 |publisher=la Escuela de Ingenieros |pages=29–30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s5BBAAAAYAAJ}}</ref> These enterprises were founded by influential citizens of the city, some of the most prominent of these people include [[Julio César Arana]], [[Cecilio Hernández]], as well as [[Luis Felipe Morey|Luis]] and [[Adolfo Morey]]. The rubber baron [[Carlos Fitzcarrald]] was also active in the city of Iquitos until he drowned in a steamship accident on the Urubamba River in 1897. Rubber entrepreneurs participated in regional politics, and directly as well as indirectly funded the development of the city. A number of successful rubber entrepreneurs held political offices, or had influence over politics in the city during this era. In 1901, Luis F. Morey became a senator for the department of Loreto, which Iquitos was the capital of. [[Enrique A. Llosa]], who had a business relationship with Arana and Luis Morey, became the mayor of Iquitos in 1901. The following year, Arana became the city's mayor,{{sfn|Almanaque|2001|p=72}} and in 1903 he assumed the office of President for Loreto's chamber of commerce.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Uribe Mosquera |first1=Tomás |title=Caucho, explotación y guerra: configuración de las fronteras nacionales y expoliación indígena en Amazonía |url=https://revistas.javeriana.edu.co/index.php/memoysociedad/article/view/8303 |website=revistas.javeriana.edu.co/ |publisher=Pontificia Universidad Javeriana}}</ref> Cecilio Hernández was also elected as the mayor, later in 1906. A census conducted in 1903 by [[Bentio Lores]], the subprefect of the Bajo Amazonas at the time, documented that there were 9,438 inhabitants in Iquitos.{{sfn|Fuentes|1908|p=158}}

In 1908, Hildebrando Fuentes, Prefect of Loreto between 1904-1906, published ''Loreto: Apuntes geográficos, históricos, esdisticos, politicos y sociales'' which was based on information he collected while in Iquitos. According to [[Cristóbal Cardemil-Krause]], Fuentes writings "make clear the existence of significant tensions between national and private interests. Entrepreneurs in Loreto controlled the area and appeared to create a state within the state, limiting the effects of Fuentes's decisions."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uriarte |first1=Javier |last2=Martínez-Pinzón |first2=Felipe |last3=Cardemil-Krause |first3=Cristóbal |title=Intimate Frontiers: A Literary Geography of the Amazon |date=2019 |page=47 |publisher=Liverpool University Press |isbn=978-1-78694-972-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-nJvEAAAQBAJ}}</ref> Fuentes also described the practice of ''[[Putumayo_genocide#Correrias|Correrias]]'' which were slave raids carried out by rubber tappers that resulted in the killing of many indigenous people. Men and older indigenous women were typically killed by the rubber tappers, while children and young females were brought to rubber camps or nearby cities, including Iquitos. The captive children and young females were typically sold at these cities.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uriarte |first1=Javier |last2=Martínez-Pinzón |first2=Felipe |last3=Cardemil-Krause |first3=Cristóbal |title=Intimate Frontiers: A Literary Geography of the Amazon |date=2019 |page=56|publisher=Liverpool University Press |isbn=978-1-78694-972-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-nJvEAAAQBAJ}}</ref>{{sfn|Fuentes|1908|p=122}} Fuentes referred to these ''correrias'' as "the great crime of the mountain" and in regards to his inability to act against the rubber tappers, he claimed that "[t]hey do all this significantly beyond the reach of authority.".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uriarte |first1=Javier |last2=Martínez-Pinzón |first2=Felipe |last3=Cardemil-Krause |first3=Cristóbal |title=Intimate Frontiers: A Literary Geography of the Amazon |date=2019 |page=56|publisher=Liverpool University Press |isbn=978-1-78694-972-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-nJvEAAAQBAJ}}</ref>{{sfn|Fuentes|1908|p=122}} Fuentes wrote that the majority of the indigenous servants at Iquitos consisted of indigenous people captured during ''correrias'', and at times these people were sold in Iquitos for a price ranging between £30 and £50.{{sfn|Fuentes|1908|p=122}} [[Walter Ernest Hardenburg]], an American engineer that had a prominent role in exposing the [[Putumayo genocide]], also claimed that indigenous people were trafficked in Iquitos and sold in that city for prices ranging between £20 and £40.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hardenburg |first1=Walter |title=The Putumayo, the Devil's Paradise; Travels in the Peruvian Amazon Region and an Account of the Atrocities Committed Upon the Indians Therein |date=1912 |publisher=T.

In an effort to discourage human trafficking from Loreto to the Brazilian Amazon, government commissioner Joaquin Capello issued a decree in 1900 that required employers to provide a bond for any of their workers that were leaving Peru. This bond was initially set at 200 Peruvian soles and had the intention of attracting employers to transport their workers back into the country once their contracts expired. The bond amount was later increased by Capello's successors.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barclay |first1=Frederica |last2=Santos-Granero |first2=Fernando |title=La frontera domesticada historia económica y social de Loreto, 1850-2000 |date=2002 |pages=157|publisher=Fondo Editorial PUCP |isbn=978-9972-42-404-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JaDTj-57CIcC&q=vega}}</ref>  In 1903, subprefect Benito Lores denounced the continuance of human trafficking in Loreto, he stated that instances of human trafficking were covered up under the pretense of transferring debts from one employer to another. Lores claimed that many of the wealthy residents of Iquitos were transporting indigenous peons and transferring their debts to patrons on rivers in Brazil.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uriarte |first1=Javier |last2=Martínez-Pinzón |first2=Felipe |last3=Cardemil-Krause |first3=Cristóbal |title=Intimate Frontiers: A Literary Geography of the Amazon |date=2019 |page=56|publisher=Liverpool University Press |isbn=978-1-78694-972-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-nJvEAAAQBAJ}}</ref>{{sfn|Fuentes|1908|p=226}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barclay |first1=Frederica |last2=Santos-Granero |first2=Fernando |title=La frontera domesticada historia económica y social de Loreto, 1850-2000 |date=2002 |pages=157–158 |publisher=Fondo Editorial PUCP |isbn=978-9972-42-404-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JaDTj-57CIcC&q=vega}}</ref> Once under the custody of their new Brazilian patrons, these indigenous people were interred deep into the forest, far away from the influence of governmental authorities, "where there is no law other than the whip or the bullet."{{sfn|Fuentes|1908|p=226}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barclay |first1=Frederica |last2=Santos-Granero |first2=Fernando |title=La frontera domesticada historia económica y social de Loreto, 1850-2000 |date=2002 |pages=157–158 |publisher=Fondo Editorial PUCP |isbn=978-9972-42-404-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JaDTj-57CIcC&q=vega}}</ref> Members of the local business class denied these allegations of trafficking reported by Lores:{{sfn|Fuentes|1908|p=226}} and in 1904 several rubber merchants signed a petition addressed to the new Prefect Hildebrando Fuentes which demanded the annulment of Capello's decree from 1900. These merchants argued that the decree was unconstitutional due to it prohibiting the free movement of people. Another argument was that instead of benefitting the affected peons, the decree worsened their situation since patrons charged the bail amount against the peons debt. The petition suggested that local authorities and representatives from the chamber of commerce should establish legislation to regulate the removal of peons from the country.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barclay |first1=Frederica |last2=Santos-Granero |first2=Fernando |title=La frontera domesticada historia económica y social de Loreto, 1850-2000 |date=2002 |pages=158 |publisher=Fondo Editorial PUCP |isbn=978-9972-42-404-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JaDTj-57CIcC&q=vega}}</ref>

The wealthiest Europeans built great mansions in the late 19th century, some of which survive. ''[[Casa de Fierro]]'' (Spanish for the Iron House) is said to have been designed by [[Gustave Eiffel]], designer of the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris, but evidence supporting this claim is scant. After a Briton, [[Henry Wickham (explorer)|Henry Wickham]], smuggled rubber seeds out of the area to establish competing rubber plantations in British colonies in southeast Asia and Africa, the boom came to an end. In addition, a 1913 investigative report by [[Roger Casement]], the British consul-general to Iquitos who had investigated labor conditions for natives in the [[Congo Free State]] when it was under [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold]]'s control, revealed the abuses committed against indigenous workers in the Putumayo River Basin by the [[Peruvian Amazon Company]] (PAC), owned by businessman Julio César Arana. Its several British board members and numerous stockholders in London were pressured into making changes in the operations of the company. Many of the British shareholders divested themselves of this company in an effort to force changes. While Arana was forced to liquidate the PAC, he retained access to most of its assets as well as territory and he continued to operate in the rubber industry through the rubber enterprise of Cecilio Hernández.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Goodman |first1=Jordan |title=The Devil and Mr. Casement: One Man's Battle for Human Rights in South America's Heart of Darkness |date=2009 |publisher=Verso, 2009 |page=259 |isbn=978-1-84467-334-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fhsXAQAAMAAJ}}</ref> Casement wrote that he was convinced that "[t]he entire Indian population is enslaved in the montaña and whereupon the devil plant, the rubber tree, grows and can be tapped.

The army garrison at Iquitos was sent to the [[Cara Paraná River|Caraparaná tributary]] of the Putumayo River in 1908 to assist Arana's company in acquiring several Colombian rubber estates through force. This detachment was accompanied by the Peruvian warship ''Iquitos''.{{sfn|Casement|1997|p=113,356}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hardenburg |first1=Walter |title=The Putumayo, the Devil's Paradise; Travels in the Peruvian Amazon Region and an Account of the Atrocities Committed Upon the Indians Therein |date=1912 |publisher=T.

In 1911, more than 237 arrest warrants were issued by judges [[Carlos A. Valcárcel]] and Rómulo Paredes against employees of the PAC due to their perpetration of the Putumayo Genocide. Pablo Zumaeta, a brother-in-law of Arana and the general manager of PAC, had an arrest warrant issued against him by Valcárcel on July 29, however Zumaeta requested to appeal it and this warrant was annulled by the Superior Court of Iquitos before the end of 1911.{{sfn|Casement|2003|p=630,687,721}} Zumaeta was permitted by local authorities and the Prefect to remain in his residency in Iquitos while his arrest warrant was active. Once the arrest warrant was annulled, Zumaeta was allowed to return to public life,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hardenburg |first1=Walter |title=The Putumayo, the Devil's Paradise; Travels in the Peruvian Amazon Region and an Account of the Atrocities Committed Upon the Indians Therein |date=1912 |publisher=T.

Valcárcel left Iquitos in protest of the Superior Courts decision to annul Zumaeta's warrant, Valcárcel was dismissed from his office for abandoning his post without permission.{{sfn|Casement|2003|p=630}}

Rómulo Paredes, Zumaeta and [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genaro%20Herrera Gennaro Herrera], another prominent citizen of Iquitos, all ran for the mayoral election of Iquitos in 1911, which was held on November 5 and 6.{{sfn|Casement|2003|p=630,721}} Paredes emerged as the candidate with the most votes from the election, in response to these results the political faction backing Zumaeta filed an appeal with the ''Junta Escrutadora'', which decided to annul the election. The ''Junta Escrutadora'' consisted of five members, two of which, Juan Bautista Vega and Victor Israel, were known associates of Julio Cesar Arana.{{sfn|Casement|2003|p=623,745}} In 1912, Zumaeta became the mayor of Iquitos, he served another term in this office in 1914.{{sfn|Almanaque|2001|p=72}} Valcárcel issued arrest warrants against Julio Arana and Juan Bautista Vega on December 10 of 1912 however these were also annulled by the Superior Court of Iquitos.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pilar Garcia |first1=Jordan |title=A propósito de redes sociales, económicas y políticas en la Iquitos de inicios del siglo XX |journal=Boletin Americanista |date=2006 |pages=112 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/28263870}}</ref> Many of those under the employ of Arana that were issued arrest warrants evaded capture.

In 1912, Hardenburg published ''The Putumayo, the Devil's Paradise'', the editor of this book noted that the English consul-general in Iquitos, David Cazes, should have been aware of human trafficking occurring between the Putumayo River and Iquitos. Judge [[Rómulo Paredes]] implicated Cazes with "aiding the guilty parties in keeping from the Peruvian Government an exact knowledge of what was taking place".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hardenburg |first1=Walter |title=The Putumayo, the Devil's Paradise; Travels in the Peruvian Amazon Region and an Account of the Atrocities Committed Upon the Indians Therein |date=1912 |publisher=T. F. Unwin, 1912 |pages=41–42 |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45204}}</ref> The editor also wrote that the twenty-one constables employed by the Peruvian government on the Putumayo River "had all been bribed by the English traders and shut their eyes to what was happening in the jungle." Hardenburg reported that he had witnessed one Peruvian comisario on the Putumayo River, César Lúrquin, travelling on a steamship with a young indigenous Huitoto girl, Hardenburg concluded that Lúrquin intended to sell this child in Iquitos. Regarding Lúrquin, Hardenburg wrote "instead of stopping on the Putumayo, travelling about there and really making efforts to suppress crime by punishing the criminals, he contented himself with visiting the region four or five times a year—always on the company’s launches—stopping a week or so, collecting some children to sell, and then returning and making his “report.”"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hardenburg |first1=Walter |title=The Putumayo, the Devil's Paradise; Travels in the Peruvian Amazon Region and an Account of the Atrocities Committed Upon the Indians Therein |date=1912 |publisher=T.

Anthropologist [[Michael Taussig]] claimed that David Cazes enterprise, the Iquitos Trading Company, was dependent on Julio César Arana's business.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Taussig |first1=Michael |title=Shamanism, Colonialism, and the Wild Man |date=2008 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |page=35 |isbn=978-0-226-79011-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HpRfEAAAQBAJ}}</ref> During Casement's investigation in 1910, he found out that several Barbadian men employed by the PAC had complained to Cazes that they were physically abused by agents of Arana's company: however Cazes did not relay this information to the British Foreign Office. Regarding Cazes, Casement wrote that "[h]e knew a very great deal of the Putumayo and kept it quiet - like everyone else in Iquitos. The Arana influence was too strong - and he was a trader and sold to them."{{sfn|Casement|1997|p=109,473}} Cazes was also aware of the newspaper publications of [[Benjamin Saldaña Rocca]], which publicly denounced Arana's company for perpetrating atrocities against indigenous people, he did not forward this information to the British Foreign Office either.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Taussig |first1=Michael |title=Shamanism, Colonialism, and the Wild Man |date=2008 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |page=35 |isbn=978-0-226-79011-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HpRfEAAAQBAJ}}</ref> Prior to November of 1911, the ''Beatriz'' steamship, owned by Cazes's company, was chartered by the Peruvian government to transport Peruvian soldiers and supplies to the Putumayo River as well as transport rubber from the Peruvian Amazon Company on that river to Iquitos. On November 27 of 1911, Roger Casement wrote that ''Beatriz'' arrived at Iquitos with 41 tons of rubber, he noted that no freight was charged by the government for the transportation of this rubber. Casement was informed by Cazes that this was in accordance with an agreement between Arana's company and the Peruvian government.{{sfn|Casement|2003|p=653-654}} 

[[File:Illustration of the rubber baron Julio César Arana, published by La Felpa in 1908.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the rubber baron Julio César Arana, published by the ‘La Felpa’ newspaper in 1908.]]

During the Peruvian Amazon Company's perpetration of the Putumayo genocide, the company's steamships occasionally trafficked indigenous people to Iquitos, where they were sold. Walter Ernest Hardenburg wrote that every steamship that left the Putumayo carried "from five to fifteen little Indian boys and girls, who are torn, sobbing, from their mothers’ arms without the slightest compunction"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hardenburg |first1=Walter |title=The Putumayo, the Devil's Paradise; Travels in the Peruvian Amazon Region and an Account of the Atrocities Committed Upon the Indians Therein |date=1912 |publisher=T.

Unwin, 1912 |pages=185,191,209 |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45204}}</ref>{{sfn|Casement|1997|p=420}} Casement implicated several other rubber businesses with trafficking indigenous people on their steamships for the slave trade in Iquitos, specifically [[Wesche & Company]] and the [[Khan Polack Company]], which were both operating on the [[Ucayali River]]. He emphasized that these companies were just as responsible for the propagation of a slave market in the region as the armed raiders carrying out [[Putumayo_genocide#Correrias|slave raids]] against the indigenous people. The reason being that these two companies supplied the raiders and transported groups of enslaved indigenous people to Iquitos or towards rubber extraction camps.{{sfn|Casement|2003|p=124}} The head of Wesche & Company, Emilio Strassberger,{{sfn|Fuentes|1908|p=211}} was elected as mayor of Iquitos between 1912-1913.{{sfn|Almanaque|2001|p=72}}

Rubber from plantations in Asia was soon produced at lower cost, undercutting that of South America, and rubber declined in importance in Peru. Iquitos continued to operate as an important trading port in the Amazon basin. It exploited its timber, oil and mineral resources for export and processing, along with agricultural and other products.

[[File:Canhoneira peruana no Porto de Iquitos (Peru) (2).jpg|thumb|Port of Iquitos, 1930]]

Among the unique communities formed by the 19th-century immigrants to the rubber boom was one of [[Sephardic Jews]] from [[Morocco]]. Many of the men married native women and made families in Iquitos. They established a [[synagogue]] and the Jewish cemetery. In the first generation, some of the women or children converted to Judaism, but by the end of the 20th century, four or five generations later, most descendants were no longer practicing Jews. Most were reared as Catholic.

In the 1990s, a descendant of a Jewish settler undertook serious study of [[Judaism]]. He began to revive the practice of Judaism among his family, friends, and other Sephardi descendants. After years of study, with the help of a sympathetic [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] [[rabbi]] in [[Lima]] and another from [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], eventually a few hundred people studied, practiced as Jews, and converted to Judaism. (Formal conversion was necessary according to ''[[Halakha]]'' as their mothers were not Jewish.) Many of the converts have emigrated to Israel under its [[Law of Return]]. A documentary was made about this community in 2010. Emigration of Peruvians from this Iquitos community has continued; about 150 emigrated in 2013 to 2014, see "[[Peruvian Jews in Israel]]" for more.

On 13 August 2012, a special [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] was placed in the plaza 28 de Julio of the city in a ceremony to commemorate the Amazon River and [[Amazon rainforest|rainforest]] as one of the [[Seven Natural Wonders of the World]].<ref name=News7Wonder>{{cite news|last=Fitzgerald|first=Eamonn|title=Peru ready to celebrate the Inauguration of the Amazon as a Wonder of Nature|url=http://news.n7w.com/2012/08/06/peru-ready-to-celebrate-the-official-inauguration-of-the-amazon-as-one-of-the-new7wonders-of-nature/|access-date=8 August 2012|newspaper=[[News7Wonder]]|date=6 August 2012}}</ref> The plaque was [[forge]]d in [[Munich]], Germany.

== Geography ==
[[File:Iquitos by NASA.JPG|thumb|[[NASA]] satellite image showing the [[Amazon River Basin]] where [[Iquitos Metropolitan Area]] is located. The [[Amazon River]] appears on the lower side of the photograph.]]
[[File:The Amazon meets Rio Nanay.jpg|thumb|[[Nanay River]] (black) meeting [[Amazon River|Amazon]] (light brown), a continuous phenomenon that occurs very close to the northern shores of [[Punchana District|Punchana, Iquitos]].]]
Iquitos is located in northeastern Peru, northeastern Loreto Region, and in the extreme south of the [[Maynas Province, Peru|Province of Maynas]]. Located on the Great Plains, the city has an area of {{convert|368.9|km2|abbr=off|1|lk=out}}, comprising the districts [[Belén District, Maynas|Belén]], Punchana and [[San Juan Bautista District, Maynas|San Juan Bautista]]. It is approximately at coordinates 03 ° 43'46 "S 73 ° 14'18" W to {{convert|106|m|abbr=off}}. It is the most northern Peruvian city.

It is surrounded by the Port of Iquitos, formed by the Amazon, Nanay and Itaya rivers. The city is situated on the left bank of the Amazon River, which provides a characteristic economic life, including [[trade]] and transport.<ref name="IIAP">{{cite web|last=Rodriguez Achung|first=Martha|title=Crecimiento Urbano de Iquitos: Condicionamientos Estructurales en la década del '70 y sus Perspectivas|url=http://www.iiap.org.pe/Upload/Publicacion/ST008.pdf|work=IIAP|publisher=July 1994|access-date=8 August 2012}}</ref> The Itaya and Nanay rivers limit the physical expansion of the city in that direction; new development is growing toward the south and there is a slight population density in Downtown Iquitos. Close to Iquitos are a number of lagoons and lakes; Moronococha Lake is a boundary to the city on the west. These features make the city seem like a huge, faux [[river island]].

Geologically, the city is settled in a [[Tertiary]]-[[Quaternary]] formation [[lithologically]] composed by little-consolidated [[lutite]]s, with remains of flora or fauna, and numerous [[white sand|white-sand]] lenses of abundant [[silicon]]. The residual soils are sandy, almost clay-like and variably deep.<ref name="IIAP"/> [[Physiography]], is a [[hazy]] landscape due to the undulations of the [[soil erosion]] caused by rain.<ref name="IIAP"/>

=== Climate ===
Iquitos experiences an equatorial climate that is a [[tropical rainforest climate]] (''Af'') under the [[Köppen climate classification]], more subject to the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] than the [[trade wind]]s and with no [[cyclone]]s. There is constant [[rainfall]] throughout the year, without a distinct [[dry season]], but a wetter summer. Because the seasons are not sensitive in the equatorial zone, Iquitos has only two seasons.

The [[rainy]] [[Wet season|summer]] arrives in November and ends in May. March and April have the heaviest rains and humidity, with precipitation between {{convert|280|and|300|mm|0}}, respectively. In May, the Amazon River, one of the rivers surrounding the city, reaches its highest levels. It falls around {{convert|9|to|12 |m|0}} at its lowest point in October, and then steadily rises again cyclically according to rainfall.<ref name=World-Guide>{{cite web |title= Iquitos Weather and Climate: Iquitos, Loreto, Peru |url= http://www.iquitos.world-guides.com/iquitos_weather.html |access-date= 19 April 2012 |work= World-Guide}}</ref>

[[Winter]] offers a drier, sunnier climate. Although July and August are the driest months, they have some periods of [[Rain|downpours]]. Sunny days and good weather are common. Rainfall is more abundant here than in [[Ayacucho]], [[Cusco]], or [[Lima]].

Iquitos also has [[microclimate]]s: rain or [[drizzle]] may be present in some areas of the districts, while other parts of the city are slightly cloudy or clear. The temperature may vary. The [[urban climate]] is slightly warmer than the natural climate, and would be reflected by the thermal sensation. It suffers from a phenomenon called [[urban heat island]], when the city's heat has difficulty dissipating during the night hours due to absorption by buildings and pavement.

=== Natural hazards ===
The main natural hazard is [[flooding]]. In 2012, [[2012 Loreto floods|major flooding occurred in Iquitos]] who alerted the population and affected coastal areas and several towns in the metropolitan area, which has a floodable, rainy geography. The floods of 2012 were regarded as the most historic natural disaster to Iquitos to date. Wet weather in Loreto took showers and drizzle, causing damage and flooding in the Loreto Region since November 2011. The rainy weather continued until early 2012, and increased the level of water in the Amazon river—wide stream that feeds most of the tributaries in Loreto – up to {{convert|117|m|lk=in|abbr=off}}. Since February and March, several villages are affected (19,209 and 18,400 families affected), 26 000 hectares of farmland are flooded and the water level reached coastal streets of Iquitos. On 24 April 2012, the spate faded, and initiated the first stage of [[Tide|ebb]].

Other natural hazards are [[heat wave]]s where temperatures can reach over {{convert|37|°C|0}} with a [[heat index]] of {{convert|45|°C|0}} which is caused by the low humidity on clear days. [[Cold wave]]s are also curious in Iquitos: cold air from the tip of the continent driven by the dynamics of the atmosphere, comes to town and causes a drop in temperature, moderate rainfall and thunderstorms. The trade winds also come to cause gales reaching {{convert|60|km/h|abbr=on|lk=out}}. In October 2012, Iquitos experienced high temperatures and heavy thunderstorms.

Earthquakes in the city are very rare and very deep. Iquitos is located in Region 3 of Systematic Regionalization Map of Peru, which means that the city has a low coefficient [[seismic value]], although the 2011 Peru earthquake, which occurred southeast of [[Contamana]], was felt in the city as a small and unexpected jolt.<ref name="IIAP"/>

=== Ecology ===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Iquitos Gnatcatcher.jpg|thumbnail|[[Iquitos Gnatcatcher]] is a highly-protected endemic species in [[Allpahuayo-Mishana National Reserve]]. The bird is also a symbol of the city.]] -->
Due to its location in the Peruvian Amazon, Iquitos has a green landscape with a vast variety of life. The flora is varied with great presence of 850 species, including 22 species of palms and orchids, who provide the attractive forest within the urban landscape of the city. Lilies are also present. The extensive forests seated within the metropolitan area host fauna including 130 species of mammals, 330 species of birds, 150 species of reptiles and amphibians, and 250 species of fish. Within the city, inhabiting the [[rock dove]] (''Columba livia''), especially in the Square 28 de Julio. Also recorded is the transient presence of [[bull shark]]s (''Carcharhinus leucas'') who come from the Atlantic Ocean, traveling 3,360 miles to reach Iquitos.

The floodplain forest of Iquitos is the peculiar ecoregion which surrounds the city, and is characterized by a [[várzea forest]] called [[Iquitos varzea]]. Its alluvial detail is the motive why intense rainy seasons easily reach these areas flood. In the natural cycle, the trees drop their leaves and other organic waste to the soil, and become [[humus]]. Rain washes these nutrients into rivers, which gives that blonde color, called [[tannin]]. Immediately, this cycle repeats.

The great biodiversity that the Iquitos Metropolitan Area houses and protects is paramount, and that is intrinsically related to its urban planning, which puts a limit action in areas where farms should not be built. Because of this, the appearance of [[informal settlements]] is seen as a risk.

=== Natural reserves and zoos ===
The importance of the existence of nature reserves is a priority in Iquitos for ecosystem protection.

The [[Allpahuayo-Mishana National Reserve]] is a protected area with soaring rates of biodiversity. The reserve is located {{convert|20|km|abbr=off}} from Iquitos, being reached by Route LO-103. The ecosystem is part of the Nanay River basin, specifically in an area called "Ecoregion Napo", which contains unique Amazonian biodiversity, including its distinctive white sand forests. The Napo Ecoregion contains 112 species of [[amphibian]]s, 17 species of [[primate]]s, 1900 plant species and over 600 bird species. Some ecologically important animals valued for their rarity in the reserve are the supay pichico (''[[Callimico goeldii]]''), black stump (''[[Callicebus torquatus]]''), equatorial saki (''[[Pithecia aequatorialis]]'') ancient antwren (''[[Herpsilochmus gentryi]]''), Mishana tyrannulet (''[[Zimmerius villarejoi]]''), Allpahuayo antbird (''[[Percnostola arenarum]]''), chestnut-tailed ant (''Myrmeciza centuculorum castanea''), the pompadour cotinga (''[[Xipholena punicea]]''), saffron-crested tyrant-manakin (''[[Neopelma chrysocephalum]]''), among others. The Iquitos gnatcatcher ([[Polioptila clementsi]]) is an endemic species of the reserve and is considered a symbol of Iquitos.

In 1808, Hipolito Sanchez Rangel, the [[bishop]] of Maynas, reported that the village of Iquitos had 171 inhabitants and on 8 June 1842, the date when the town was elevated to a district, it had just over 200 inhabitants.
[[File:Iquitos et l'Amazonie 835.jpg|thumb|200px|The northeast side of Iquitos in 1987, when the population of Iquitos still maintained its rural aspect in developing as a [[metropolis]].]]
In 1860, according to Paz Soldan, the town had only 300 inhabitants. Two years later, the population increased to about 431 inhabitants and in 1864, there were 648 people, predominantly mestizo due to the presence of families from Borja, Santiago, Santa Teresa, Barranca and others, who fled away from the attack on the Huambisas and Aguaruna native and destroyed the villages.

According to Genaro Herrera, in 1866, Iquitos had a population of 648 people. For 1876, again the same author reports a population of 1,475 inhabitants.

In 1903, in the middle of the [[rubber boom]], Iquitos had 9,438 inhabitants (census of Benito Lords), of which 542 were foreigners, most of them from Spain (95) Brazil (80), China (74), Portugal (64) and as many from Italy, England, France, Ecuador, United States, Russia, Switzerland and Morocco.

The political geography of Iquitos consists of four districts or [[Commune (administrative division)|communes]], each with a district municipality. Except for Iquitos District which does not have a district municipality and as such, the Provincial Municipality of Maynas also functions as its council district. The other districts are with a respective one: District Municipality of Punchna, the District Municipality of San Juan Bautista and the District Municipality of Belén. Each municipality has control in its own district, and each has a policy of [[urban planning]] that is created according to the state of its district.

Iquitos is the main center of commerce, tourism and industry in the Amazon rainforest with the world. As gateway to the Peruvian Amazon, the economy of many parts of the region come to Iquitos for sustainable control. The Economic Development Management of the Provincial Municipality of Maynas is responsible for regulating and regulate trade, business development and employment, tourism and rural production both Iquitos District as whole Maynas Province. Meanwhile, the [[Chamber of Commerce]] of Iquitos is headed by economist Victor Manuel Valdivia Barberis.

The [[fishing industry]] is another big support for the economy of the city. The Belen Market has a frenetic commercial activity that is part of its economy. Iquitos has great financial backing has been able to help it progress now since its role in the rubber boom, although must be overcome with effort after the [[rubber]] was no longer produced in the city. The petroleum industry, despite being outside the urban area of Iquitos, has greatly influenced its evolution. In addition, trade has mainly helped the growth of the city. In San Juan Bautista, economic development is based on agriculture ([[sugar cane]], [[peach palm|pijuayo]], [[star apple|caimito]]), fish, [[poultry]], [[livestock]] ([[cattle]], [[bubaline]]) and [[mining]]. The petroleum, one of the most precious resources, extracted mainly from the region northwest of Loreto and part of it is transported to the [[Oil refinery|refinery]] in Iquitos. The timber transport is another important economic factor, however, due to the [[Free Trade Agreement]] between Peru and the United States, the gross exploitation of timber has decreased considerably.

According to Rolando Arellano, president of Arellano Marketing, describes the ''Iquiteño'' consumer to have greater preference for a "[[Western world|Western model]] with a more modern orientation than the Peruvian-Andean lifestyle".

With projects of large [[Shopping mall|mall]]s, the city still has a trade-in retail stores and minimarkets throughout the metropolitan area, more strongly in main avenues such as Prospero, Arica, Grau and Alfonso Ugarte located in the center of Iquitos and the Belén District. [[Retail|Retail distribution]] of imported products has created regional and social stratification that goes from the merchant importer to urban [[retailer]], which serves as a strong link between the urban and rural economy.

== Education ==
Iquitos is home to numerous research projects on ecology related to [[ornithology]] and [[herpetology]]. [[Cornell University]] owns a field station dubbed the [[Cornell University Esbaran Amazon Field Laboratory]]. Founded in July 2001 under the direction of Dr. [[Eloy Rodriguez]], the facility is dedicated to education, [[conservation biology|conservation]], and the discovery of novel medicinal compounds from applied field [[chemoecology]].

The field lab strives to survey and catalog the biological diversity found along the [[Yarapa River]] Basin. It provides researchers with field experience in the broad range of disciplines necessary for this task. Another major goal is to explore value-added derivatives of biodiversity. This includes both tangible returns, in the form of new discoveries in the biomedical and related sciences, as well as less tangible goods, such as the promotion of [[ecotourism]] and an ecological ethic. They work to ensure benefits to the local communities, and to participating students and researchers.

=== Universities ===
Iquitos has four universities: Universidad Nacional de la Amazonía Peruana (UNAP), the local state university; Universidad Particular de Iquitos (UPI), Universidad Científica del Perú (UCP), Universidad Peruana del Oriente (UPO) three private institutions. It is also home to the ''Instituto de Investigaciones de la Amazonía Peruana'' (IIAP), the Institute of Investigation of the Peruvian Amazon.

== Transport ==
[[File:Santa clara drone.jpg|left|thumb|200x200px|Santa Clara highway, completed in 2018]]
Iquitos has a personality very different from the rest of Peru and even different from other South-American Amazonian cities. The streets of Iquitos are dominated by more than 25,000 [[auto rickshaws]] or motokars, known in the rest of Peru under the name of mototaxi, and for foreigners as auto rickshaw or tuk-tuk, providing taxi service. The buses are large vehicles made of wood with direct routes.

Iquitos is widely regarded as the largest inland city that is inaccessible by road. Air and river transport are the main means for entry or exit of people and goods to the city, since the cost of living in this city is generally higher than the Peruvian standard. It is considered that Iquitos is the second most expensive city in Peru after [[Cusco]]. A proposed road link to [[Sarameriza (Peru)|Sarameriza]], to be completed by 2021, would connect Iquitos to the country's road network.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/05/connecting-largest-city-unreachable-road-170508081433163.html|title=Connecting the largest city unreachable by road}}</ref>

The city has renewed [[Crnl. FAP Francisco Secada Vignetta International Airport]] where domestic and international flights operate.

While in the international terminal there are flights from/to [[Panama City]] on Wednesdays and Saturdays with [[Copa Airlines]] also connecting from/to USA, Mexico, Canada, Central America & Caribbean, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and Brazil. There are between 8 and 9 daily flights to Iquitos from Lima, some make intermediate stops in [[Pucallpa]] and [[Tarapoto]]. Air routes are served by four companies: [[LAN Perú]], [[Peruvian Airlines]], [[Star Perú]] and [[Copa Airlines]]. The direct flight between Lima and Iquitos takes 1 hour and 45 minutes. Copa Airlines provides international flights to the city with Panama and the Americas from 14 July 2012. Since June 2011, the Central Government of Peru provided two [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter|de Havilland Canada DHC-6 ''Twin Otter'']] for operations across the region.

Historically, the first native inhabitants of the settlements built their houses of sticks and leaves and other natural resources, which were tailored to protect against the [[climate]], wildlife and other hazards.<ref name=Joaquin-arquitectura/> The styles of housing in those settlements were huts and cocameras, used as large communal houses. Other notable conventional architectures are characterized by their firmness and isothermal conditions; they are categorized into three types of home: [[quincha]] —built with posts and [[Arundo donax|giant cane]]—, [[rammed earth]] —resistant and isothermal—, and [[adobe]] —irm with the same isothermal condition.<ref name=Joaquin-arquitectura/><ref name=Asieslaselva>{{cite book|last=Villarejo|first=Avencio|title=Así es la selva|year=1979|publisher=CETA|page=303}}</ref>

The rubber boom of the 1880s caused a severe change in the architectural style of Iquitos. Foreign and [[rubber baron]]s brought with them the influence of countries like Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, and descendants as [[Sephardim]]. Jose de Jesus Reategui and a young group built the main features of the urban city during the rubber boom, including the Iglesia Matriz de Iquitos.<ref name=Joaquin-arquitectura/> In the Iquitos popular belief of the 19th century, [[iron]] was considered less humane and aesthetic, but Gustave Eiffel got the Casa de Fierro became an attraction in the city, although historically the prefabricated building was not designed for Iquitos.<ref name=Joaquin-arquitectura/> [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] style also influenced the architecture of Iquitos, and defense against the rain was another prominent feature added to buildings.<ref name=Joaquin-arquitectura/> About 90 buildings are declared architectural heritage sites of Loreto.<ref name=Joaquin-arquitectura/>

Iquitos has a vibrant, unique, complex and diverse [[culture]], and is regarded as the cultural hub of the Peruvian Amazon, according to [[Lonely Planet]]. Many natives visit the city to showcase their dances or sell their [[craft]]s. The city also has a wealth of customs and traditions that have remained consistent over the years such as following the Iquitos calendar, celebrating cultural festivities, [[cuisine]], [[Spanish accent]] and mythology. Currently, its culture is undergoing an impetuous transition to a contemporary level to preserve their traditions with innovative art movements.

One of the main factors of the traditional cultural energy of Iquitos is Amazonian mythology, which has a range of characters, identified by folklore in imaginary beings. Many of the legendary beings, with appearances motivated by local geography, have powers and influenced much in [[agriculture]] and [[worldview]] of Iquitos.

The Peruvian writer [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] wrote his work ''[[Captain Pantoja and the Special Service]]'' inspired by the city. [[Francisco Lombardi]]'s [[Captain Pantoja and the Special Services (2000 film)|2000 film]], based on the novel by Vargas Llosa was filmed in this city. In [[Rómulo Gallegos Prize|Rómulo Gallegos-winning]] ''[[The Green House]]'' (1965) and ''[[The Dream of the Celt]]'' (2010), other novels of Mario Vargas Llosa, also part of the plot occurs in Iquitos.

With a growing organization of entertainment today, the city has always had groups concerned to project the Iquitos [[The arts|arts]] such as dance, music, film, painting, literature and theater.

In the [[visual arts]], the city is the birthplace of [[Amazonian pop art]] (also known wild [[naive]])<ref name="SobrePerú">{{cite web|last=Agustin|first=Marangoni|title=Pop amazónico de la ciudad de Iquitos|url=http://sobre-peru.com/2012/01/18/pop-amazonico-en-la-ciudad-de-iquitos/|work=Sobre Perú|date=18 January 2012|access-date=8 August 2012}}</ref> which is a unique, [[self-taught]], [[pop-art]] style of the city, and is notable for its "sparkling" [[chromaticism]], and makes a reference to [[hallucinogenic]] [[ayahuasca]] experiences. Originally, it is a [[mural|mural art]] that blends prominently the colorful amazonian culture, European motifs and commercial characters, which may be influenced by American [[pop art]], especially [[MTV]].

In several works of painters ''iquiteños'' (such as Christian Bendayan, Roldán Pinedo, Elena Valera, Rember Yahuarcani, Brus Rubio and Victor Churay), Amazonian pop art legacy has been a visual reference to create avant-garde works of contemporary life in the city and Amazonian culture.

The Dirección Regional de Cultura (formerly known as Instituto Nacional de Cultura del Perú), with headquarters in the city, mainly funded events and arts festivals in the city, although there are also small [[indie art|indie]] or [[Subculture|underground]] groups that conduct their own cultural events. The city has many small festivals; the highlights are [[Estamos en la Calle]], Iquitos Outfest, and other small annual events.

The city is known for having a remarkable celebration, called simply ''Carnaval''. During this festival, mainly pagan, celebrants are dedicated to wetting people with ''[[Water balloon|cabaciñas]]'' or other instrument. Many choose to be more extravagant, wetting with various substances such as paint or other object as cause for celebration. The celebration is unique each year in February. The carnival is heavily influenced by myths and rich Amazonian culture. It also celebrates the Day of San Juan, referring to [[John the Baptist]] as patron saint in the Peruvian Amazon, whose feast is celebrated on 24 June. The main element is the juane and other own dances as shunto jump.

Tourism is one of the most vital industries in Iquitos, which has a growing reputation as a [[honeypot (geography)|honeypot]] due to its location on the banks of the Amazon River, one of the [[New Seven Wonders of Nature|seven natural wonders of the world]]. Through the years, Iquitos receives a considerable number of foreigners; the tourist index grew by international flights offered by the city's airport. Tourism in the city formed into European-style architecture, cuisine, drinks, art, culture, worldview, Spanish accent and historical references of Loreto. Iquitos has adequate infrastructure to accommodate tourists from all levels. It has a 5-star hotel, many of 3-, 2-, and 1-star rating.

====Spiritual tourism====
{{Main|Ayahuasca}}
{{see also|Spiritual tourism}}

[[Ayahuasca]] is known as a major cultural landmark, and [[Mysticism|mystic]] tourism has increased in Iquitos in recent years. The drink, made from the vine ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi]]'', is investigated by the Western people with a medicinal purpose and study, and was named the nation's cultural heritage.

Dangers, however, still exist when coming into contact with the drug. Shamans are not regulated and none have proof of credentials. While deaths in Iquitos are rare, they have been reported, including Frenchman Fabrice Champion and American Kyle Nolan.<ref name="Hearn14">{{cite web|last1=Hearn|first1=Kelly|title=The Dark Side of Ayahuasca|url=https://www.mensjournal.com/features/the-dark-side-of-ayahuasca-20130215/|website=Men's Journal|date=12 March 2014|publisher=Wenner Media|access-date=7 December 2014}}</ref>

Iquitos is home to the annual Amazonian Shamanism Conference.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vineofthesoul.org|title=Vines of the Soul}}</ref> Here, like-minded individuals meet in Iquitos yearly to discuss Ayahuasca.

=== Amazon commemorative capital ===
Iquitos is home to the {{convert|120|kg|lbs}}, [[bronze]] [[commemorative plaque]] of the Amazon River [[Amazon Basin|basin]] as one of the [[New Seven Wonders of Nature|seven natural wonders of the world]], which was granted on 13 August 2012 by Fernand Weber, founder of [[New7Wonders of Nature|New7Wonders]]. The distinction is shared with [[Bolivia]], Brazil, [[Ecuador]], [[Suriname]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]] and [[French Guiana]], however, recognition was given to Peru which originally ran for the Amazon through the Regional Government of Loreto based in Iquitos.

The awards show was held in Iquitos.<ref name="Global Voices">{{cite news|last=García Calderón|first=Gabriela|title=Peru: Amazon Officially Inaugurated as Nature's Wonder|url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/08/16/peru-amazon-officially-inaugurated-as-natures-wonder/|access-date=26 August 2012|newspaper=Global Voices|date=16 August 2012}}</ref> It began with a massive parade along Avenida Quiñonez, and eventually culminated in the main day, 13 August, divided into two sessions throughout the day: the first in the confluence of the Itaya and [[Nanay river|Nanay]] in the afternoon, and the second on 28 July Square of the city at night. The event received intense international attention. Similar to [[Machu Picchu]] as a [[Seven Wonders of the World|wonder of the world]], Iquitos, as the main entrance to the Amazon, expects great tourist revenue.

The [[President of Peru]] [[Ollanta Humala]], next to the First Lady Nadine Heredia and Loreto Regional President Ivan Vasquez received the award. Jean Paul de la Fuente, New7Wonders foundation director, said positively on the image of Iquitos:

{{cquote|Clearly there will be economic and tourism impacts. The examples we have of other places are growths of 10, 20 and 30 percent annually|author=Jean Paul de la Fuente}}

However, despite the great satisfaction, the award caused polarized reactions indicating that the Regional Government of Loreto would be on duty to plan better [[urban development]] in Iquitos for the forecasted intense tourism.<ref name="Global Voices"/> The negative scrutiny aimed at disorganized and massive [[Sewerage|sewer]] construction was damaging the city streets, causing discomfort and accidents in traffic and littering the aesthetic image of Iquitos. Several ''iquiteños'' citizens criticized it via [[Twitter]].<ref name="Global Voices"/>

=== Spanish accent ===
Iquitos is also attractive for its [[Amazonic Spanish]], a [[dialect]] of Spanish spoken in the Amazon. The dialect is more noticeable in speech than it is in writing, such as [f] and [x] are [[allophone]]s, (e.g., Juana is pronounced /fana/), especially when it is next to one or semivowel. (''Los fríos de San Juan''; ''Los fríos de San Fän''), the double preposing and possessive genitive (De Antonio sus amigos; From Antonio his friends), and the preemption of [[Article (grammar)|article]]s against the names (''Juana'', ''Lä Fuana''). There are also other languages spoken as [[Iquito language|Iquito]], [[Yagua language|Yagua]], [[Ese Ejja language|Ese Ejja]], or other native languages in Loreto, and foreign languages like English and French because of increasing globalization.

=== Cuisine ===
[[Juane]] is one of the main dishes of cuisine of the Peruvian jungle. It is widely consumed during the Catholic [[Feast of San Juan]] (St. John), held on 24 June each year. The dish was named in honor of San Juan Bautista. The dish could have a [[pre-Columbian]] origin. With the arrival of the Spanish, missionaries popularized the Biblical story of [[Salome]], John, and [[Herodias]]. Some believe the dish's name comes from the reference to the head of San Juan.

[[File:Tacacho con cecina y chorizo (Lima).JPG|thumb|150px|right|[[Tacacho]] with [[chorizo]]]] Another popular dish is [[Tacacho]], made from fried slices of plaintain mashed with [[chicharron]]es (fried pork fat). It is usually accompanied with [[chorizo]] (fried sausage) making it a savory combination. The dish is typical of Iquitos as well as the Peruvian Amazon. It is widespread in the rest of the country. The term ''tacacho'' derives from the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] term, ''taka chu'', which means beaten. Tacacho consumption varies depending on the region where it is made. In Madre de Dios and San Martín, many people eat tacachos for breakfast, while in other regions, it is a dish served at lunch or dinner. In the San Martín region, tacacho is included in the Christmas dinner. In the Amazon region of Ecuador, the dish is known as ''bolon''. It has a counterpart in the [[Caribbean islands]], where it is called ''mofongo''.
