==History==
===Pre-20th century===
Foshan remained a minor settlement on the [[Fen River (Guangdong)|Fen River]] for most of China's history. It developed around a [[Tang dynasty|Tang]]-era [[Buddhist monastery]] that was destroyed in 1391.<ref name=mcds/> The [[Foshan Ancestral Temple]], a [[Taoist temple]] to the [[Heidi (god)|Northern God]] (''Beidi'') that was rebuilt in 1372, became the new focus of the community by the 15th century.<ref name=mcds/>

By the early [[Ming dynasty|Ming]], Foshan had grown into one of the four great markets in China, primarily on the strength of its local [[Chinese porcelain|ceramics]] but also on account of its metalwork.<ref name=poetry>{{citation |last=Vogel |first=Ezra F. |title=One Step Ahead in China: Guangdong under Reform |date=October 1990 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NU2NLLjO1fUC |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NU2NLLjO1fUC&pg=PA182 182] |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674639119 |access-date=2016-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030141657/https://books.google.com/books?id=NU2NLLjO1fUC |archive-date=2016-10-30 |url-status=live }}.</ref> Under the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], its harbor on the Fen River was limited to ships of a thousand tons' burden but it remained well connected with Guangdong's other ports.<ref name=poetry/> By the 19th century, Foshan was considered the "[[Birmingham, England|Birmingham]] of China", with its steel industry responsible for the consumption of the majority of the province's iron production.<ref name=eb9/>

===20th century and onwards===
Foshan was connected to [[Guangzhou]] and [[Sanshui]] by rail in the early 20th century.<ref name=poetry/> The Ancestral Temple was converted into the [[Foshan Municipal Museum]] upon the victory of the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communists]] in the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Foshan remained primarily focused on ceramic and steel production until the 1950s, when it became an [[urbanization in China|urbanizing]] political center. On 26 June 1951, it left [[Nanhai County]] to become a separate [[county-level city]] and, in 1954, it was made the seat of the prefectural government.<ref name=poetry/> Its economy stagnated as a result of the [[Cultural Revolution]]—traditional ceramic ware was forbidden and its workshops were turned to producing [[Maoism|Maoist]] and [[Chinese Civil War|Revolutionary]] [[wikt:trinket|folderol]]—but it continued to grow, reaching 300,000 people by the 1970s, making it the province's second city after Guangzhou.<ref name=poetry/>

As early as 1973, however, its agriculture and consumer industries were permitted to become an export production base and a modern highway linked it to Guangzhou soon after. This permitted its party secretary [[Tong Mengqing]] and mayor [[Yu Fei (politician)|Yu Fei]] to take full advantage when [[Deng Xiaoping]] introduced [[Chinese economic reform|his Opening Up policies]] after the fall of the [[Gang of Four]].<ref name=poetry/>

In 1983, Foshan was promoted to a [[prefecture-level city]] with its former core becoming the new [[Chancheng District]] but lost the southwestern half of its former territory to [[Jiangmen]].<ref name=poetry/> On 8 December 2002, [[Shunde District|Shunde]] and [[Nanhai District|Nanhai]] joined its urban core as a full district.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

Since 2020, a Japanese-themed street in Foshan has become a hit with young people unable to travel abroad due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=SCMP>[https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3103711/chinese-unable-travel-abroad-are-flocking-mock-japanese Chinese, unable to travel abroad, are flocking to a mock Japanese street in Guangdong], [[South China Morning Post]], 1 October 2020</ref> The 100m-long road called Ichiban Street has been outfitted by a local property developer to resemble famous commercial streets in Japan, complete with a sakura tree, an icon of Japan.<ref name=SCMP/> The “exotic” street is attracting young people from nearby cities like Guangzhou, Zhongshan and Zhuhai as the younger Chinese generation likes many things about Japanese culture and design.<ref name=SCMP/>
