Throughout much of the 19th century, Cincinnati was among the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade|top 10 U.S. cities by population]]. The city developed as a [[port|river town]] for cargo shipping by [[steamboats]], located at the crossroads of the [[Northern United States|Northern]] and [[Southern United States|Southern]] United States, with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of [[German Americans|German-speaking immigrants]], who founded many of the city's cultural institutions. It later developed an [[Industrialisation|industrialized]] economy in manufacturing. Many structures in the urban core have remained intact for 200 years; in the late 1800s, Cincinnati was commonly referred to as the "[[Paris]] of America" due mainly to ambitious architectural projects such as the [[Cincinnati Music Hall|Music Hall]], [[Cincinnatian Hotel]], and [[John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge|Roebling Bridge]].<ref>{{cite web |title=When Cincinnati was 'the Paris of America' |date=April 19, 2010 |work=Building Cincinnati |url=http://www.building-cincinnati.com/2010/04/when-cincinnati-was-paris-of-america.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419145025/http://www.building-cincinnati.com/2010/04/when-cincinnati-was-paris-of-america.html |archive-date=April 19, 2012 }}

=== Etymology ===
Two years after the founding of the settlement then known as "Losantiville", [[Arthur St. Clair]], the governor of the [[Northwest Territory]], changed its name to "Cincinnati", possibly at the suggestion of the surveyor [[Israel Ludlow]],<ref>{{cite journal |last=Teetor |first=Henry Benton |date=May–October 1885 |title=Israel Ludlow and the naming of Cincinnati |location=Cleveland |volume=2 |pages=251–257 |quote=The fair and reasonable presumption is that after consultation (certainly with Ludlow, the surveyor of the town, the proprietor of a two-thirds' interest in his own right, and as agent of [[Mathias Denman|Denman]]), St. Clair adopted the name suggested by Ludlow—a name which, as may seen from the following testimony, was not only mentioned for more than a year prior to the coming of St. Clair, but was selected and adopted by Denman, [[Robert Patterson (pioneer)|Patterson]] and Ludlow in the winter of 1788–9, and was inscribed upon the plat made by Ludlow to take the place of the one first made by [[John Filson|Filson]], which was destroyed in a personal altercation between Colonel Ludlow and Joel Williams. |journal=[[Magazine of Western History]]}}</ref> in honor of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]].<ref name="Suess 2013">{{cite news |last=Suess |first=Jeff |date=December 28, 2013 |title=Cincinnati's beginning: The origin of the settlement that became this city |work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]] |url=https://www.cincinnati.com/story/ourhistory/2013/12/28/cincinnatis-beginning-the-origin-of-the-settlement-that-became-this-city/5363707/ |access-date=August 11, 2018 |quote=On Jan. 2, 1790, Gen.

Cincinnati began in 1788 when Mathias Denman, [[Colonel Robert Patterson]], and [[Israel Ludlow]] landed at a spot at the northern bank of the Ohio opposite the mouth of the [[Licking River (Kentucky)|Licking]] and decided to settle there. The original surveyor, [[John Filson]], named it "Losantiville", a combination of syllables drawn from French and Latin words, intended to mean "town opposite the mouth of the Licking".<ref name="History of Cincinnati">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924032193520 |title=History of Cincinnati, Ohio |publisher=Cleveland, O., L.A.

During the time, employers struggled to hire enough people to fill positions. The city had a labor shortage until large waves of immigration by Irish and Germans in the late 1840s. The city grew rapidly over the next two decades, reaching 115,000 people by 1850.<ref name="city-ws" />

In 1884, outrage over a manslaughter verdict in what many observers thought was a clear case of murder triggered the [[Cincinnati riots of 1884|Courthouse riots]], one of the most destructive riots in American history.

===20th century===
[[File:Mount Adams Incline c1905.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mount Adams Incline]], {{Circa|1905}}]]
At the beginning of the 20th century, Cincinnati had a population of 325,902. The city completed many ambitious projects in the 20th century starting with the [[Ingalls Building]] which was completed in 1903. An early rejuvenation of downtown began into the 1920s and continued into the next decade with the construction of [[Cincinnati Union Terminal]], the [[Potter Stewart United States Courthouse|United States Courthouse and Post Office]], the [[Cincinnati Subway]], and the 49-[[Storey|story]] [[Carew Tower]], which was the city's tallest building upon its completion. Cincinnati weathered the [[Great Depression]] better than most American cities of its size, largely due to a resurgence in river trade, which was less expensive than transporting goods by rail. The [[Ohio River flood of 1937]] was one of the worst in the nation's history and destroyed many areas along the Ohio valley.<ref>{{Cite web |date=January 21, 2016 |title=WATCH: Flood of 1937 in one-of-a-kind video |url=https://www.wcpo.com/news/our-community/from-the-vault/from-the-vault-great-ohio-river-flood-of-1937-was-biggest-event-in-tri-state-history |access-date=March 5, 2021 |website=WCPO |language=en |archive-date=May 2, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210502105858/https://www.wcpo.com/news/our-community/from-the-vault/from-the-vault-great-ohio-river-flood-of-1937-was-biggest-event-in-tri-state-history |url-status=live }}</ref> Afterward the city built protective [[flood wall]]s. After [[World War II]], Cincinnati unveiled a master plan for urban renewal that resulted in modernization of the inner city. During the 1950s, Cincinnati's population peaked at 509,998. Since the 1950s, $250 million was spent on improving neighborhoods, building clean and safe low- and moderate-income housing, providing jobs and stimulating economic growth.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WpBKAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA35 |title=Oversight on Housing and Urban Development Programs, Washington, D.C.: Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Housing and Urban Affairs of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, United States Senate, Ninety-third Congress, First Session |author=United States Congress Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Subcommittee on Housing and Urban Affairs |date=1973 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |pages=35 |language=en |access-date=September 9, 2023 |archive-date=March 27, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240327031824/https://books.google.com/books?id=WpBKAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA35#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== 21st century to present ===
At the dawn of the 2000s, Cincinnati's population stood at 331,285. The construction of [[Paycor Stadium|Paul Brown Stadium (currently known as Paycor Stadium)]] in the year 2000 resulted from a sales tax increase in [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]], as did the commencement of construction for [[Great American Ball Park]], which later opened its doors in 2003.

The city experienced the [[Cincinnati riots of 2001|2001 Cincinnati riots]], causing an estimated $3.6 million in damage to businesses and $1.5-2 million in damage to the city itself. Subsequently, substantial transformations unfolded, particularly in the process of gentrification within the [[Over-the-Rhine]] neighborhood.

In 2018, [[Major League Soccer|MLS]] announced the inclusion of [[FC Cincinnati]], becoming the city's third professional sports team. [[TQL Stadium]], located on Cincinnati's west end, was subsequently constructed and opened its doors in 2021. Notably, the 2020 census revealed that Cincinnati had witnessed a population growth, marking the first such increase since the 1950 census.

On January 4, 2022, [[Aftab Pureval]] assumed office as the 70th mayor of Cincinnati.

"The City of Seven Hills" stems from the June 1853 edition of the ''West American Review'', "Article III—Cincinnati: Its Relations to the West and South", which described and named seven specific hills. The hills form a crescent around the city: [[Mount Adams, Cincinnati|Mount Adams]], [[Walnut Hills, Cincinnati|Walnut Hills]], [[Mount Auburn, Cincinnati, Ohio|Mount Auburn]], [[Vine Street, Cincinnati|Vine Street Hill]], [[College Hill, Cincinnati|College Hill]], Fairmont (now rendered [[South Fairmount, Cincinnati|Fairmount]]), and Mount Harrison (now known as [[Price Hill, Cincinnati|Price Hill]]). The name refers to ancient Rome, reputed to be built on seven hills.{{Citation needed|date=April 2023}}

"Queen City" is taken from an 1819 newspaper article<ref>{{Cite web |title=Letter from Alfred Kleinne-Krautzmann to Robert M.

Cincinnati was platted and proliferated by [[American ancestry|American settlers]], including [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch Irish]], [[American frontier|frontiersmen]], and [[keelboat]]ers. For over a century and a half, Cincinnati went unchallenged as the most prominent of Ohio's cities, a role that earned it the nickname of "chief city of Ohio" in the 1879 ''[[New American Cyclopædia]]''. In addition to this book, countless other books have documented the social history of both the city and its frontier people.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cincinnati: Queen City of the West, 1819-1838 |last1=Aaron |first1=Daniel |publisher=Ohio State University Press |year=1992 |isbn=0814205704}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Ohio: The History of a People |last1=Cayton |first1=Andrew R.

==Government and politics==
[[File:Cincinnati City Hall, Cincinnati, OH.jpg|thumb|[[Cincinnati City Hall]], completed in 1893]]
The city proper operates with a [[Election Results, City Council of Cincinnati, Ohio|nine-member city council]], whose members are elected [[at-large]]. Prior to 1924, city council members were elected through a system of [[Ward (politics)|wards]]. The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated city politics, with the [[political machine]] of [[George B. Cox|George B. "Boss" Cox]] exerting control.

A reform movement arose in 1923 which ended machine rule.  It was led by another Republican, [[Murray Seasongood]]. He founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a [[council–manager government]] form of government, in which a smaller council hires a professional manager to operate the daily affairs of the city. From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by [[proportional representation]] and [[Single transferable vote|single transferable voting]]. Starting with [[Ashtabula, Ohio|Ashtabula]] in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.

In an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.<ref name="amy">[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/articles/Brief%20History%20of%20PR.htm Douglas J.

The top nine vote-getters were elected (the "9-X system"), which favored candidates who could appeal to the entire geographic area of the city and reach its residents with campaign materials. The mayor was elected by the council. In 1977, 33-year-old [[Jerry Springer]], later a notable television talk show host, was chosen to serve one year as mayor.

To have their votes count more, starting in 1987, the top vote-getter in the city council election was automatically selected as mayor. Starting in 1999, the [[List of mayors of Cincinnati, Ohio|mayor]] was elected separately in a general at-large election for the first time. The city manager's role in government was reduced.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} These reforms were referred to as the "[[Mayor-council government|strong mayor]]" reforms,{{by whom|date=September 2020}} to make the publicate accountable to voters.

[[File:NationalUndergroundRailroadFreedomCenter.jpg|thumb|The [[National Underground Railroad Freedom Center]] recognizes Cincinnati's role in the history of the [[Underground Railroad]] as an important crossing from the [[Confederate States of America|South]] to the [[Union (American Civil War)|North]].]]
Due to its location on the Ohio River, Cincinnati was a border town in a free state, across from Kentucky, which was a slave state. Residents of Cincinnati played a major role in [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]]. Many [[fugitive slave]]s used the Ohio River at Cincinnati to escape to the North. Cincinnati had numerous stations on the Underground Railroad, but there were also runaway slave catchers active in the city, who put escaping slaves at risk of recapture.

Given its southern Ohio location, Cincinnati had also attracted settlers from the Upper South, who traveled along the Ohio River into the territory. Tensions between abolitionists and slavery supporters broke out in repeated violence, with whites attacking black people in 1829. Anti-abolitionists attacked black people in the city in a wave of destruction that resulted in 1,200 black people leaving the city and the country; they resettled in Canada.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/negroinourhisto01woodgoog |title=The Negro in Our History |first1=Carter G. |last1=Woodson |first2=Charles Harris |last2=Wesley |publisher=Associated Publishers (digitized from original at University of Michigan Library) |page=[https://archive.org/details/negroinourhisto01woodgoog/page/n162 140] |year=1922 |access-date=October 1, 2013}}</ref> The riot and its refugees were topics of discussion throughout the country, and black people organized the first Negro Convention in 1830 in [[Philadelphia]] to discuss these events.

White riots against black people took place again in Cincinnati in 1836 and 1842.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> In 1836 a mob of 700 pro-slavery men attacked black neighborhoods, as well as a press run by [[James M. Birney]], publisher of the anti-slavery weekly ''The Philanthropist''.<ref>[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/abolitn/mobhp.html "The Pro-Slavery Riot in Cincinnati"] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918235047/http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/abolitn/mobhp.html |date=September 18, 2008 }}, Abolitionism 1830–1850, ''Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture'', University of Virginia, 1998–2007, accessed January 14, 2009</ref> Tensions increased after congressional passage in 1850 of the [[Fugitive Slave Act]], which required cooperation by citizens in free states and increased penalties for failing to try to recapture escaped slaves.

[[Levi Coffin]] made the Cincinnati area the center of his anti-slavery efforts in 1847.<ref>Levi Coffin, ''Reminiscences of Levi Coffin, the reputed president of the underground railroad: being a brief history of the labors of a lifetime in behalf of the slave, with the stories of numerous fugitives, who gained their freedom through his instrumentality, and many other incidents'', Cincinnati: Western Tract Society, University of Michigan Library</ref> [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] lived in Cincinnati for a time, met escaped slaves and used their stories as a basis for her novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852). The [[National Underground Railroad Freedom Center]], which opened in 2004 on the Cincinnati riverfront in the middle of "[[The Banks, Cincinnati|The Banks]]" area between [[Great American Ballpark]] and [[Paul Brown Stadium]], commemorates the volunteers who aided refugee slaves and their drive for freedom, as well as others who have been leaders for social justice.

Located in a free state and attracting many European immigrants, Cincinnati has historically had a predominantly white population.<ref name="pop"/> By 1940, the Census Bureau reported the city's population as 87.8 percent white and 12.2 percent black.<ref name="pop">{{cite web |title=Ohio&nbsp;– Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |access-date=April 16, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archive-date=August 12, 2012}}</ref>

In the second half of the 20th century, Cincinnati, along with other [[rust belt]] cities, underwent a vast demographic transformation. By the early 21st century, the city's population was 40% black. Predominantly white, working-class families who constituted the urban core during the European immigration boom in the 19th and early 20th centuries, moved to newly constructed suburbs before and after World War II. Black people, fleeing the oppression of the [[Jim Crow]] South in hopes of better socioeconomic opportunity, had moved to these older city neighborhoods in their [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to the industrial North. The downturn in industry in the late 20th century caused a loss of many jobs, leaving many people in poverty and [[Homelessness in Ohio|homeless]]. In 1968 passage of national civil rights legislation had raised hopes for positive change, but the assassination of national leader [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] resulted in riots in many black neighborhoods in Cincinnati; unrest occurred in black communities in nearly every major U.S. city after King's murder.

More than three decades later, in April 2001, racially charged [[Cincinnati riots of 2001|riots]] occurred after police fatally shot a young unarmed black man, [[Cincinnati riots of 2001#Incident|Timothy Thomas]], during a foot pursuit to arrest him, mostly for outstanding traffic warrants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cincinnati.com/unrest/ |title=Cincinnati.Com – Your Key to the City |work=cincinnati.com |access-date=June 27, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706105950/http://cincinnati.com/unrest/ |archive-date=July 6, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> After the 2001 riots, the ACLU, Cincinnati Black United Front, the city and its police union agreed upon a community-oriented policing strategy.

[[File:Cincinnati Union Terminal Rotunda.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Cincinnati Union Terminal]] serves [[Amtrak]]'s ''[[Cardinal (train)|Cardinal]]'' line and houses several museums.]]
Cincinnati has several standard modes of transportation including sidewalks, roads, public transit, bicycle paths and airports. The city's hills preclude the regular [[street grid]] common to many cities built up in the 19th century, and outside of the downtown basin, regular street grids are rare except for in patches of flat land where they are small and oriented according to topography.

Most trips are made by car, with transit and bicycles having a relatively low share of total trips; in a region of just over 2 million people, less than 80,000 trips were made with transit on an average day in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s1118.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020120307/http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s1118.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 20, 2011 |title=Transit Ridership in Selected Urbanized Areas - US Census Bureau}}</ref> Like many other Midwestern cities, however, bicycle use grew rapidly in the 2000s and 2010s.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.citylab.com/commute/2011/09/substantial-increases-bike-ridership-across-nation/161/ |title=Is Bicycle Commuting Really Catching On?

In 2015, 19.3 percent of Cincinnati households lacked a car and the figure increased slightly, to 21.2 percent, in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Cincinnati averaged 1.3 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Car Ownership in U.S. Cities Data and Map |journal=Governing |date=December 9, 2014 |url=http://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html |access-date=May 4, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511162014/http://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html |archive-date=May 11, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The development of a [[light rail]] system had long been a goal for Cincinnati, with several proposals emerging over many decades. The city grew rapidly during its [[Streetcars in Cincinnati|streetcar era]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and is today served by the [[Connector (Cincinnati)|Connector]]. In 1917, citizens voted to spend $6&nbsp;million (~${{Format price|{{Inflation|index=US-GDP|value=6000000|start_year=1916}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US-GDP}}) to build the [[Cincinnati Subway]]. The subway was planned to be a {{Convert|16|mi|km|adj=on}} loop around the city hitting the suburbs of [[St. Bernard, Ohio|St. Bernard]], [[Norwood, Ohio|Norwood]], [[Oakley, Ohio|Oakley]] and [[Hyde Park, Ohio|Hyde Park]] before returning Downtown.<ref>{{cite book |last=Singer |first=Allen J. |title=The Cincinnati Subway: History of Rapid Transit |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7F8zr3DwTsC |access-date=July 23, 2011 |series=Images of America Series |date=May 26, 2003 |publisher=[[Arcadia Publishing]] |location=Mount Pleasant, SC |isbn=978-0-7385-2314-9 |page=36 |archive-date=March 27, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240327033413/https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7F8zr3DwTsC |url-status=live }}</ref> [[World War I]] delayed commencement of construction until 1920 and inflation raised the cost to over $13&nbsp;million (~${{Format price|{{Inflation|index=US-GDP|value=13000000|start_year=1920}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US-GDP}}), causing the Oakley portion never to be built. Mayor [[Murray Seasongood]], who took office later in the decade, argued it would cost too much money to finish the system, and construction stalled after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].

Cincinnati is served by the [[Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority]] (SORTA), the [[Transit Authority of Northern Kentucky]] (TANK) and the [[Clermont Transportation Connection]]. SORTA and TANK primarily operate {{Convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} diesel buses, though some lines are served by longer articulated or hybrid-engine buses. SORTA buses operate under the "Metro" name and are referred to by locals as such.

A system of public staircases known as the [[Steps of Cincinnati]] guides pedestrians up and down the city's many hills. In addition to practical use linking hillside neighborhoods, the 400 stairways provide visitors with scenic views of the Cincinnati area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/dote/dote-programs/hillside-steps/ |title=Hillside Steps – Transportation & Engineering |publisher=Cincinnati-oh.gov |access-date=July 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524113925/http://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/dote/dote-programs/hillside-steps/ |archive-date=May 24, 2013}}</ref>

Cincinnati is served by [[Amtrak]]'s ''[[Cardinal (train)|Cardinal]]'', an intercity passenger train which makes three weekly trips in each direction between Chicago and New York City through [[Cincinnati Union Terminal]].

===Roadways===
[[File:Fort Washington Way at night.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Washington Way]], one of Cincinnati's major freeways]]
Bus traffic is heavy in Cincinnati. Several motor coach companies operate out of Cincinnati, making trips within the Midwest and beyond. The city has a [[Orbital road|beltway]], [[Interstate 275 (Ohio)|Interstate 275]] (which is the third-longest beltway overall in the United States at {{Convert|85|mi|km|sp=us|disp=or}}) and a spur, [[Interstate 471]], to [[Kentucky]]. It is also served by [[Interstate 71 (Ohio)|Interstate 71]], [[Interstate 74 (Ohio)|Interstate 74]], [[Interstate 75 (Ohio)|Interstate 75]] and numerous U.S. highways: [[U.S. Highway 22 (Ohio)|US 22]], [[U.S. Highway 25 (Ohio)|US 25]], [[U.S. Highway 27 (Ohio)|US 27]], [[U.S. Highway 42 (Ohio)|US 42]], [[U.S. Route 50 in Ohio|US 50]], [[U.S. Highway 52 (Ohio)|US 52]], and [[U.S. Highway 127 (Ohio)|US 127]]. The [[Riverfront Transit Center]], built underneath 2nd Street, is about the size of eight football fields. It is only used for sporting events and school field trips. At its construction, it was designed for public transit buses, charter buses, school buses, city coach buses, light rail, and possibly commuter rail. When not in use for sporting events, it is closed off and rented to a private parking vendor.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.go-metro.com/about-metro/about2/doingbusiness/doingbusinesswithmetro/riverfront-transit-center |title=Riverfront Transit Center |access-date=February 14, 2020 |archive-date=July 28, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728141550/https://www.go-metro.com/about-metro/about2/doingbusiness/doingbusinesswithmetro/riverfront-transit-center |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/i-team/i-team-48-million-transit-station-sits-empty |title=I-Team: $48 million transit station sits empty |first=Brendan |last=Keefe |date=October 31, 2011 |access-date=February 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216100317/http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/i-team/i-team-48-million-transit-station-sits-empty |archive-date=February 16, 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2009/07/07/cincinnatis-riverfront-transit-center-attracts-criticism/ |title=Cincinnati's Riverfront Transit Center Attracts Criticism |date=July 7, 2009 |access-date=February 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112215226/http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2009/07/07/cincinnatis-riverfront-transit-center-attracts-criticism/ |archive-date=November 12, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>
