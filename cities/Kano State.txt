==Politics==
The state government is led by a democratically elected governor who works closely with the state House of Assembly. The capital city of the state is [[Kano (city)|Kano]].<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web |last=Oguntola |first=Tunde |date=27 September 2022 |title=2023: Next President, Govs Must Get Two-thirds Spread, Says INEC |url=https://leadership.ng/2023-next-president-govs-must-get-two-thirds-spread-says-inec/ |access-date=23 February 2023 |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Electoral system===
The governor of each state is selected using a modified two-round system. To be elected in the first round, a candidate must receive the plurality of the vote and over 25% of the vote in at least two-third of the State local government Areas. If no candidate passes the threshold, a second round will be held between the top candidate and the next candidate to have received a plurality of votes in the highest number of local government Areas.<ref name="auto1"/>
