'''Sohag''' ({{Langx|ar|سوهاج|Sawhāj}}, {{IPA|arz|soˈhæːɡ|link=yes}}, {{IPA|aec|suːˈhaːdʒ|link=yes}}), also spelled as '''Suhag''' or '''Suhaj''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&men=gpro&lng=en&des=wg&geo=419601169&srt=npan&col=abcdefghinoq&msz=1500&pt=c&va=|title=World Gazetteer: Sohag - profile of geographical entity including nam…|date=16 December 2012|access-date=15 October 2017}}{{dead link|date=May 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> is a city on the west bank of the [[Nile]] in Egypt. It has been the capital of [[Sohag Governorate]] since 1960, before which the capital was [[Girga]] and the name of the governorate was Girga Governorate. It also included Esna Governorate (nowadays [[Qena Governorate]]).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Law |first=Gwillim |title=Administrative Subdivisions of Countries: A Comprehensive World Reference, 1900 through 1998 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4lmOAAAAMAAJ&q=Girga |format=snippet view |access-date=2010-08-07 |year=1999 |publisher=McFarland |location=Jefferson, NC |isbn=978-0-7864-0729-3 |page=114}}</ref>

== History ==
The modern city developed from the village of ''Suhay'' ({{Langx|ar|السوهاى}}) (or ''Sumay''), the name of which eventually transformed into Suhaj,<ref>{{cite book| author = محمد رمزي | chapter = | chapter-url = | format = | url =  | title = القاموس الجغرافي للبلاد المصرية | orig-year = | agency =  | edition =   |location=  |date =  |publisher=  |volume=  | pages = 128| series =  | isbn = }}</ref> and is located on the site of several ancient settlements, the largest of which is ''Bompae'' ({{Langx|grc|Βομπαη}}; {{Langx|cop|ⲃⲟⲙⲡⲁϩⲟ|lit=channel of Paho}} or {{Langx|cop|ⲡⲓⲃⲟⲙⲡⲁϩⲉ|lit=the place of Paha}}).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trismegistos.org/place/3002|title=TM Places|publisher=www.trismegistos.org|accessdate=2019-09-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=TM Places |url=https://www.trismegistos.org/place/3002 |access-date=2022-08-09 |website=www.trismegistos.org}}</ref> The others include ''Tmupaie'' ({{Langx|grc|Τμουπαει}}, {{Langx|cop|ⲧⲙⲟⲩⲡⲁϩⲟ|lit=the island of Paha}}), ''Bay'' ({{Langx|ar|الباى}}, possibly an Arabisation of the aforementioned "Paha") and ''Sawaqi'' ({{Langx|ar|سواقى}}).

== Geography ==
[[File:Sohag by NASA.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite image of Sohag]]
Sohag lies on a fertile agricultural plain on the western bank of the Nile,<ref name="roughguide">{{Cite book|last=Richardson|first=Dan|title=The Rough Guide to Egypt|year=2003|isbn=1-84353-050-3|pages=322–323|publisher=Rough Guides |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uL86PAq-eHMC&q=sohag&pg=PA322}}</ref> approximately {{convert|6|km|abbr=off}} southwest of [[Akhmim]]. The city includes two islands; Karaman-ez-Zahur Island is larger and uninhabited, and ez-Zahur Island (جزيرة الزهور, Ǧazīrat az-Zuhur, "Flower Island") has some homes.

== Economy ==

The city Sohag of itself encloses only a few archaeological sites, hence tourism represents but a small portion of the city's income. Other sources of income include trade, small industries of carpets, furniture, spinning and weaving and sugar. Administrative and educational services are two big sectors of income.

=== Mosques ===

* '''[[Sidi Arif Mosque]]''' (Arabic: مسجد العارف بالله, Masjid al-ʿArif bi-Allah). The mosque is located in the south of the city. The el-ʿArif Mosque was built in the 14th century—the 8th century in the Islamic calendar. The present building was constructed around 1995. At the corners of the façade are two [[minaret]]s and the roof is crowned by a dome. Inside the five-nave mosque the bases of the piers and the walls were lined with red granite. The ceiling is painted ornamentally; in its middle is an elongated light dome. The southeastern half is lit by chandeliers. At the end are the prayer niche ([[mihrab]]) with simple ornaments and to the right of it the wooden pulpit (minbar).

* El-Farshuti Mosque (Arabic: جامع الفرشوطي, Jāmʿi al-Farschūṭī), also named el-'Atiq Mosque (the old mosque) is located approximately {{convert|350|m|abbr=off}} southwest of the [[Sidi Arif Mosque]]. The most striking feature of the mosque is its {{convert|53|m|ft|adj=mid|lk=out|abbr=off|-high}} minaret in the southeast corner. The minaret has galleries with balustrades on four floors. The mosque is a modern, bright building. The mosque is divided into five naves by columns and pillars. It has a central light dome, which is inscribed at the bottom with a [[sura]] from the [[Qur'an]]. The bases of the walls are painted yellow and white with green bands. A very colorful prayer niche next to the wooden pulpit is located at the southeastern side.

In the masonry on the eastern, southern and western sides are stones engraved with historical inscriptions moved from previous buildings, including a decree of the penultimate [[Mamluk]] sultan [[Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri|al-Ghawri]] (1441–1516) from the year 1506 (911 AH) on the southeastern side.

Sohag has two important churches that were erected in the 20th century: the Church of the Holy Virgin and the [[Church of Saint George (Sohag)|Church of Saint George]].

* The Church of the Holy Virgin (Arabic: كنيسة السيدة العذراء, Kanīsat as-Saiyida al-ʿAdraʾ). The church is located in the north of the bazaar (souq Qaiṣarīya). It consists of five naves. There are three sanctuaries for Saint George (left), the Holy Virgin and the Archangel Michael at the ends of the middle three naves. All sanctuaries are completely screened by a wooden [[iconostasis]]. On both sides of the entrances to the sanctuaries are wooden icons of the Holy Virgin and Jesus. The Lord's Last Supper and the crosses are located above the iconstasis. The presentation in the central nave is framed by a fish and a pigeon; the other ones are framed by angels and a dove. Galleries are located above the aisles and the entrance. On the walls are paintings of saints and scenes from the life of Jesus.

=== Monasteries ===
====White Monastery====
{{Main|White Monastery}}

'''The Coptic White Monastery''' is a [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]] monastery named after Saint [[Shenouda the Archimandrite]]. It is located about {{convert|5|km|abbr=off}} west of Sohag. The monastery's name is derived from the color of the white limestone in its outside walls. The surviving building is the church of what was once a much larger monastery complex.<ref name="Haag">{{Cite book|last=Haag|first=Michael|title=Egypt|year=2004|publisher=New Holland Publishers|pages = 222–226|isbn=1-86011-163-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EgXqbGauz0kC&q=sohag&pg=PA223}}</ref>

====Red Monastery====
{{Main|Red Monastery}}

The '''Red Monastery''' is a [[Coptic Orthodox]] monastery named after an Egyptian saint called '''Pishay'''. It is located about {{convert|5|km|abbr=off}} north of the White Monastery. The monastery's name is derived from the color of the construction material of its outside walls, consisting of red (burnt) brick. The walls are considerably thicker at the base than at the top and, like the walls of [[Ancient Egyptian]] temples, they are surmounted by cavetto moldings. The Red Monastery is architecturally similar to the White Monastery.<ref name=Haag/>

=== Temples and cemeteries ===

Sohag is the site of a temple built for the goddess [[Repyt]] (Triphis) by [[Caesarion|Ptolemy XV Caesarion]] and subsequent Roman emperors. South of this temple was an earlier temple of [[Ptolemy IX Soter II]] (see also [[Athribis Project]]). One of the nearby tombs of the brothers Ibpemeny "the younger" and [[Pemehyt]] of the late second century BC, has two zodiacs on its ceiling.<ref>[[Richard Talbert]], ''[[Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World]]'', ({{ISBN|0-691-03169-X}}), p. 77.</ref>

== Subdivisions ==

Sohag is informally divided into the East District (Arabic: حى شرق) and the West District (Arabic: حي غرب). Among the most notable regions of the West District are:
* Sidi Aref
* Al Shahid (Arabic for the Martyr)
* Gharb Al-Koubry ("West of the Bridge" neighborhood)

The East District is considered a more upscale district; it includes some of the most affluent neighborhoods of the city including 15th Street, Al Kashef Street, Jumhuriya Street, The Courts Compound, and The Technical and Agricultural Schools. Some of the most notable locales of the East District include:
* The Courts Compound of Sohag
* City Hall of Sohag
* [[Sohag University]]
* Sohag Teaching Hospital, one of the biggest hospitals of the region
* Multiple governmental directorates
* Many recreational areas including The Sohag Stadium and many parks including Al Zohour, a revitalized island park located in the middle of the Nile.
* Nasr City, the first satellite city to be built in the East District. It was established during the presidency of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]].

== Climate ==
{{main|Climate of Egypt}}

The [[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies Sohag's climate as [[hot desert climate|hot desert]] (BWh). [[Luxor#Climate|Luxor]], [[Minya, Egypt#Climate|Minya]], Sohag, [[Qena#Climate|Qena]] and [[Asyut#Climate|Asyut]] have the widest difference of temperatures between days and nights of any city in Egypt, with almost {{convert|16|C-change}} difference. Sohag is one of the warmest places in Egypt due to its location on the eastern side of [[Sahara]] in North Africa. Sohag is ranked the 5th driest place in Egypt and the 9th globally. Also ranked 4th warmest place in Egypt and 296th globally.
