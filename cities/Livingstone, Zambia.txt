==History==
===Pre-colonial history===
Mukuni, {{convert|9.6|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the south-east of present-day Livingstone, was the largest village in the area before Livingstone was founded. Its [[Leya language|Baleya]] inhabitants, originally from the [[Rozwi]] culture in [[Zimbabwe]], were conquered by Chief Mukuni who came from the [[DR Congo|Congo]] in the 16th century. Another group of Baleya under Chief Sekute lived near the river west of the town. The predominant people in the area, though, were the Batoka under Chief Musokotwane based at Senkobo, {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} north. These are southern [[Tonga people (Zambia and Zimbabwe)|Tonga people]] but are culturally and linguistically similar to the Baleya.<ref name="LTC">[http://www.livingstonetourism.com/pages/history.htm Livingstone Tourism website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012153527/http://livingstonetourism.com/pages/history.htm |date=2007-10-12 }} accessed 10 March 2007.</ref>
[[File:Livingstone1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to [[David Livingstone]]]]
The Subiya paid tribute to the [[Lozi people|Lozi]] of [[Barotseland]] but in 1838 the [[Kololo]], a [[Lesotho|Sotho]] tribe from [[South Africa]] displaced by [[Ndwandwe-Zulu War|Zulu wars]], migrated north and conquered the [[Lozi people|Lozi]]. The Kololo placed chiefs of their subordinate [[Subiya people]] of [[Sesheke]] over the Tokaleya. In 1855 Scottish [[missionary]] traveller [[David Livingstone]] became the first European to be shown the [[Zambezi]] in Livingstone vicinity, to see [[Victoria Falls]] by the Subiya-Kololo Chief Sekeletu.<ref name="Spectrum">Camerapix: "Spectrum Guide to Zambia." Camerapix International Publishing, Nairobi, 1996.</ref>

===Colonial history===
In the 1890s [[Cecil Rhodes]]'s [[British South Africa Company]] established the [[British Empire|British]] rule north of the Zambezi and launched a wave of mineral prospecting and exploration activity and as well ventured into other natural resources such as timber, ivory and animal skins in a territory called [[North-Western Rhodesia]]. The main crossing point of the Zambezi was above the falls at the Old Drift, first by dugout canoe, later by an iron boat propelled by eight Lozi paddlers, or a barge towed across with a steel cable. The [[Batoka Formation|Batoka Gorge]] and the deep valley and gorges of the middle Zambezi (now flooded by the [[Kariba Dam]]) meant there was no better crossing point between the Falls and [[Kariba Gorge]], {{convert|483|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-east. As the Old Drift crossing became more frequently used, a British colonial settlement sprang up there and around 1897 it became the first [[municipality]] in the country;  it is sometimes referred to as 'Old Livingstone'. Its proximity to [[mosquito]] breeding areas caused deaths from [[malaria]], so after 1900 the Europeans moved to higher ground known as Constitution Hill or Sandbelt Post Office, and as that area grew into a town it was named ''Livingstone'' in honour of the explorer.<ref name="NRJ"/>

In the mid-1890s [[Rhodesia Railways]] had reached [[Bulawayo]] in [[Southern Rhodesia]] spurring industrial development there, fuelled by the coal mines at [[Hwange]] (then named ''Wankie'') just {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}} south-east of Mosi-oa-Tunya. The railway was extended to Hwange for the coal, but Rhodes's vision was to keep pushing north to extend the [[British Empire]], and he would have [[Cape-Cairo railway|built it to Cairo]] if he could. In 1904 the railway reached the Falls on the southern side and construction of the [[Victoria Falls Bridge]] started.<ref>{{Cite web |last=VFHQadmin |title=Victoria Falls Bridge Activities and History - Victoria Falls HQ |url=https://victoriafallshq.com/victoria-falls-bridge-activities/ |access-date=2022-09-11 |language=en-US}}</ref> Too impatient to wait for its completion, Rhodes had the line from Livingstone to [[Kalomo]] built and operations started some months in advance of the bridge using a single locomotive which was conveyed in pieces by temporary cableway across the gorge next to the bridge building site.<ref>[http://www.nrzam.org.uk/Railway/Rail.html ''Horizon'' magazine: "Zambia's Second Industry", February 1965, pp4-11.]</ref>

[[File:Zambèze-Chapelle commémorative Coillard à Livingstone (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Livingstone in the early 20th century]]
The city was founded in 1905.<ref>Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/Livingstone Livingstone], britannica.com, USA, accessed on September 8, 2019</ref> The [[British South Africa Company]] moved the capital of the territory there in 1907.<ref name="NRJ">{{Cite web |title=Untitled Document |url=http://www.nrzam.org.uk/NRJ/V4N1/V4N1.html |access-date=2022-12-27 |website=www.nrzam.org.uk}}</ref> In 1911 the company merged the territory with [[North-Eastern Rhodesia]] as [[Northern Rhodesia]]. Livingstone prospered from its position as a gateway to trade between north and south sides of the Zambezi, as well as from farming in the Southern Province and commercial timber production from forests to its north-west. A number of colonial buildings were erected which still stand.<ref name="Spectrum"/> Although the capital was moved to [[Lusaka]] in 1935 to be closer to the economic heartland of the [[Copperbelt]], industries based on timber, hides, [https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tobacco tobacco], cotton (including textiles) and other agricultural products grew. A hydroelectric plant was built taking water from the Eastern Cataract of the Falls. The town of [[Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe|Victoria Falls]] in [[Southern Rhodesia]] had the tourist trade, but many supplies were bought from Livingstone.

Of all the towns in Northern Rhodesia, colonial Livingstone took on the most British character.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Livingstone Town: Livingstone, Zambia|url=http://www.livingstonetourism.com/livingstone-town/|website=www.livingstonetourism.com|access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref> Surrounded by large numbers of African settlements, it had a strongly marked [[Racial segregation|segregation]] which while not being officially enshrined as an [[apartheid]] policy, had similar practical effects. The north and western areas of the town and the town centre were reserved for the colonial government and white-owned businesses and associated residential areas, while African townships such as Maramba (named after the small Maramba River flowing nearby) were in the east and south and were inhabited by working [[servant]]s, [[Artisan|craftsman]], [[tradesman]], as well as large numbers of non-working black families suffering under [[welfare dependency]]. Asians and people of mixed race owned businesses in the middle, on the eastern side of the centre.<ref name="Mwakikagile 2010"/>

During [[World War II]], 170 [[Polish people|Polish]] refugees escaping from [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|German- and Soviet-occupied Poland]], were admitted in Livingstone in 1941, and a Polish consular post was established there.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wróbel|first=Janusz|title=Uchodźcy polscy ze Związku Sowieckiego 1942–1950|year=2003|language=pl|publisher=[[Institute of National Remembrance|Instytut Pamięci Narodowej]]|location=[[Łódź]]|pages=137, 141|isbn=978-83-7629-522-0}}</ref>

As the British government began publicly discussing independence, and news of the large scale massacres of white colonials in nearby [[Belgian Congo]] was heard, many white residents  feared abandonment by the British colonial government. Consequently, many began making moves to migrate south toward [[Southern Rhodesia]] or South Africa. When Northern Rhodesia obtained independence as Zambia, many more whites continued to leave.<ref name="Mwakikagile 2010"/> At the end of British rule in 1964, Africans were handed a country in which there were only 100 black college graduates, almost all in social sciences from the [[University of Fort Hare]] in South Africa.<ref>{{Cite web |title=the struggle movie zambia |url=https://paraluxe.com/aa2uaca/the-struggle-movie-zambia |access-date=2022-05-24 |website=paraluxe.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=the struggle movie zambia |url=https://paraluxe.com/aa2uaca/the-struggle-movie-zambia |access-date=2022-05-23 |website=paraluxe.com}}</ref> In 1968, a one party state had been established which seized most remaining non-black property, especially those of whites.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bayart |first=J.

===Post-independence===
Some colonial civic buildings were destroyed and replaced with an [[African culture|African]] architecture, although Livingstone was used as a location for a 1950s Rhodesian town in the 1981 movie ''[[The Grass Is Singing]]'' (based on the [[Doris Lessing]] novel of that name).<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084033/ IMDB Internet Movie Database] accessed 10 March 2007.</ref>

Since the beginning of the 21st century, Livingstone has experienced a resurgence in tourism and has firmly become the destination of choice when visiting the Victoria Falls. Livingstone has enjoyed a slight influx of investment in the industry from modern hotel chains like [[Sun International]], to some modern street strip mall centers and restaurants.<ref>[http://www.livingstonestourism.com]{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> Apart from tourism, the other hope on Livingstone's horizon is development stimulated by the [https://saiia.org.za/saiia-toolkit/walvis-bay-corridor-group/ Walvis Bay Corridor] with the opening of the [[Katima Mulilo Bridge]] and completion of the [[Trans–Caprivi Highway]] {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} west, which funnels more trade through the town.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2012-01-24 |title=A Lesson in Zambian History: Livingstone |url=https://www.globalblackhistory.com/lesson-in-zambian-history-livingstone/ |access-date=2022-05-24 |website=Global Black History |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Esser |first=Leonore |title=The bridge over the Zambezi at Katima Mulilo is a symbol of freedom and cornerstone of economic development |url=https://www.kfw.de/stories/kfw/stories/economy/infrastructure/sambesi-bruecke/ |access-date=2022-05-24 |website=KfW Stories |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2012-01-24 |title=A Lesson in Zambian History: Livingstone |url=https://www.globalblackhistory.com/lesson-in-zambian-history-livingstone/ |access-date=2022-05-23 |website=Global Black History |language=en-US}}</ref>
