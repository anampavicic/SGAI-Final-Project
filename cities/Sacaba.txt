'''Sacaba''' is a capital city and a [[Municipalities of Bolivia|municipality]] in the [[Bolivia]]n province of [[Chapare Province|Chapare]]. The city, located {{Convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on}} eastward from [[Cochabamba]], is the second largest city in the [[Cochabamba Department]] after Cochabamba city. Post-colonial architecture may be seen in the inner part of Sacaba; however, some has been destroyed due to lack of municipal care.

Sacaba was the site of anti-[[coca eradication]] riots in 2002, which caused the removal of [[Evo Morales]], leader of the ''[[cocalero]]'' movement and the [[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|MAS]], from his seat in the Bolivian congress. Morales opposed the closing of a [[coca]] market in Sacaba, and ensuing protests involved the death of several people on both sides. Morales served as [[president of Bolivia]] between 2006 and 2019.
