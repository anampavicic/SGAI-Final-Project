==History==
===18th century===
In the early 1700s, the area that is present-day Allentown was a wilderness of [[Quercus ilicifolia|scrub oak]], where the [[Lenape]], a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous Peoples]] tribe, fished for trout and hunted for deer, grouse, and other game. In 1736, this large area north of [[Philadelphia]] was deeded by 23 chiefs of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] to three sons of [[William Penn]], founder of the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial-era]] [[Province of Pennsylvania]]: [[John Penn ("the American")|John Penn]], [[Thomas Penn]], and [[Richard Penn Sr.|Richard Penn]]. The price for the land included shoes, buckles, hats, shirts, knives, scissors, combs, needles, [[Mirror|looking glasses]], rum, and pipes.<ref name="bicen">Allentown PA Bicentennial – Lehigh Country Sesquicentennial 1962 Commemorative Book</ref>

On May 18, 1732, the land was deeded by Thomas Penn to [[Joseph Turner (loyalist)|Joseph Turner]], an iron manufacturer and politician from Philadelphia. Two years later, on September 10, 1735, a {{convert|5000|acre|km2|adj=on}} part of the land was purchased from Turner's business partner by [[William Allen (loyalist)|William Allen]], a wealthy shipping merchant and former [[mayor of Philadelphia]].<ref name="Allentown1916"/>

The land was surveyed in 1736 and again in 1753 as part of an effort to construct a road from [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]] in the east to [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]] in the west.<ref name="Allentown1916"/> The 1753 survey reported that a [[log house]], owned by Allen and built around 1740, existed near the western banks of [[Jordan Creek (Pennsylvania)|Jordan Creek]]. The house was used primarily as a hunting and fishing lodge by Allen, but he also used it to entertain prominent guests, including [[James Hamilton (Pennsylvania politician)|James Hamilton]], his brother-in-law, and John Penn, then governor of the Province of Pennsylvania.<ref name="Allentown1916">Page 17. Source indicates that the foundations of the lodge were located and destroyed in 1845 when excavations took place.</ref> In 1752, [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton]] and [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks]] counties were formed; Easton was named the [[county seat]] of Northampton County, and Reading the county seat of Berks County.

In 1762, the land, including present-day Allentown, was named and laid out by Allen. A rivalry between the Penns and Allen may have inspired Allen to acquire the land and found the city.<ref name="bicen"/> In 1763, a year after Allentown's founding, an effort was made by Allen and others to move the county seat from Easton to Allentown, but the Penns' influence prevailed and the county seat remained in Easton.<ref name="bicen"/>

The city's original organization, whose archives are now housed at the [[Historical Society of Pennsylvania]] in Philadelphia, included 42 city blocks and 756 lots, most of which were {{convert|60|ft|m}} in width and {{convert|230|ft|m}} in depth. The city was initially located between present-day 4th and 10th streets and Union and Liberty streets and was initially named Northampton Towne.

Many streets on the original plan were named for Allen's children, including Margaret (present-day 5th Street), William (now 6th Street), James (now 8th Street), Ann (now 9th Street), and John (now Walnut Street). Allen Street (now 7th Street), the city's main street, was named for Allen himself. [[Hamilton Street]] was named for James Hamilton, deputy governor of colonial-era Pennsylvania from 1748 to 1754. Gordon Street was named for [[Patrick Gordon (governor)|Patrick Gordon]], an earlier deputy governor of colonial Pennsylvania. Chew Street was named for [[Benjamin Chew]], and Turner Street was named for Allen's business partner Joseph Turner.<ref name="Allentown1916"/>

Allen hoped that the city would displace Easton as the seat of Northampton County and become a major national center for commerce due to its location along the [[Lehigh River]] and its proximity to Philadelphia, which was then the nation's largest and most influential city. In 1767, Allen granted the land to his son James.<ref name = "Proceedings">{{Cite journal |last=Roberts |first=Charles R. |title=William Allen, the Founder of Allentown, and His Descendants |journal=Proceedings of the Lehigh County Historical Society |issue=1st |pages=22–43 |publisher=Lehigh County Historical Society |location=Allentown, Pennsylvania |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j7VL8u8BCkUC |year=1908 |access-date=August 17, 2008 |archive-date=September 20, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230920173558/https://books.google.com/books?id=j7VL8u8BCkUC |url-status=live}}</ref>

Allentown played a central role in both inspiring the [[American Revolution]] and supporting the subsequent [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. Some of the first [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] resistance to [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonialism]] in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] began in and around present-day Allentown. On December 21, 1774, a [[Committee of safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Observation]] was formed by Allentown-area patriots. Following the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]'s unanimous signing by the [[Second Continental Congress]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] governing control in Allentown began to break down as patriot militias expanded their resistance. The patriot militias also pressured [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tories]] out of the city, and expanded their ranks, which were ultimately incorporated into the [[Continental Army]]. The burden of supplying the local militias fell on the people, and requisitions for food, grain, cattle, horses, and cloth were common.<ref name="Moll">{{cite web |url=https://www.angelfire.com/pa5/mollpa/ |title=The Moll Family In Pennsylvania |website=[[Angelfire]] |access-date=October 23, 2017 |archive-date=June 24, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624203658/http://www.angelfire.com/pa5/mollpa/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

During the Revolutionary War, [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessian]] prisoners of war were kept in Allentown in the vicinity of present-day Seventh and Gordon streets. Allentown also housed four hospital structures, including one at [[High German Evangelical Reformed Church|Zion Reformed Church]] and one on the grounds of the present-day [[Farr Building]], that were used in treating wounded Continental Army troops.

After [[George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River|crossing the Delaware]] and prevailing in the [[Battle of Trenton]] on December 26, 1776, [[Continental Army]] commander [[George Washington]] and his staff traveled through Allentown, where they proceeded up present-day [[Lehigh Street]], then called Water Street. They stopped at the foot of the street at a large spring at the present-day Wire Mill. There, Washington and his troops rested and watered their horses, and then proceeded to their post of duty.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lehighvalleyhistory.com/allentown-city |title=Allentown City – Lehigh Valley History |website=lehighvalleyhistory.com |access-date=October 23, 2017 |archive-date=October 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024043615/http://lehighvalleyhistory.com/allentown-city |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1777, a manufacturer of [[paper cartridge]]s and [[musket]]s for the Continental Army relocated to Allentown from neighboring [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]], and a shop of 16 [[armourer]]s was established on [[Little Lehigh Creek]], which was used to repair Continental Army weapons and manufacture [[saddle]]s and [[scabbard]]s for their use.<ref name="Allentown1916"/>

Allentown holds historical significance as the location where the [[Liberty Bell]], then known as the State House Bell, was successfully hidden for nine months by [[Patriot (American Revolution)|American patriots]] to avoid its capture by the [[British Army during the American Revolutionary War|British Army]] after the [[Philadelphia campaign|fall of Philadelphia]] during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].

After George Washington's defeat at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] in [[Chadds Ford Township, Pennsylvania]] on September 11, 1777, the revolutionary capital of [[Philadelphia]] was left defenseless and American patriots began preparing for what they saw as an imminent British attack on the city. [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania's Supreme Executive Council]] ordered that 11 bells, including the State House Bell, now known as the Liberty Bell, and ten other bells from Philadelphia's [[Christ Church, Philadelphia|Christ Church]] and [[St. Peter's Episcopal Church (Philadelphia)|St. Peter's Church]], be taken down and moved out of Philadelphia to protect them from the [[British Army during the American Revolutionary War|British Army]], which would melt the bells down to cast into munitions. The bells were transported north to present-day Allentown by two farmers and wagon masters, John Snyder and Henry Bartholomew, and then hidden under floorboards in the basement of [[High German Evangelical Reformed Church|Zion Reformed Church]] at present-day 622 [[Hamilton Street]] in [[Center City Allentown]], just prior to Philadelphia's September 1777 fall to the British.

===19th century===
In 1803, the city, whose mail had previously been received in neighboring [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]], had a post office established inside Compass and Square Hotel in the present-day Penn National Bank building at 645 [[Hamilton Street]] in Allentown. In the [[1810 United States census|1810 U.S. census]], the city's population exceeded 700 residents, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania granted Northampton Towne legal standing on March 18, 1811, incorporating it initially as the Borough of Northampton in what was then [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton County]]. The new borough's government first undertaking was ordering that cows in the city be moved from public streets to pastures, which proved unpopular with city residents. The following year, the city became part of [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh County]], which was partitioned from a western section of Northampton County.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="BOT">{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=70xGAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA142 |title=Past, Present, and Future of the City of Allentown, Pa |date=October 23, 1886 |publisher=Daily chronicle and news print |access-date=October 23, 2017 |via=Google Books}}</ref>

Throughout the early 1800s, the city grew primarily as a court and market town. Northampton Bank, the city's first bank located at the northeast corner of Center Square, was chartered in July 1814, and the first Hamilton Street Bridge, a {{convert|530|ft|m}}-long chain structure, was constructed over the [[Lehigh River]]. The bridge featured two suspended lanes, one for east and one for westbound traffic, and a toll house at the bridge's western end.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="BOT"/><ref name="LCHS1">Allentown, 1762–1987, a 225 Year history, Volume II, 1921–1987, Lehigh County Historical Society, 1987.</ref> In 1829, [[Lehigh Canal]], a {{convert|46.6|mi}}-long canal on the Lehigh River's east side, was completed for both ascending and descending navigation.

In 1838, the city's name was officially changed to Allentown. But it soon faced major challenges. In 1841, a flood swept away Hamilton Street Bridge and inflicted substantial damage on areas of the city near the Lehigh River. Two years later, in 1843, Northampton Bank failed following excessive speculation by the bank, resulting in financial ruin for many bank customers. Five years later, on June 1, 1848, a large fire burned down most of Allentown's central business district between 7th and 8th streets on Hamilton Street.

During the 1850s, however, the city began recovering. A new bridge was built across the Lehigh River, and brick buildings were constructed to replace wooden ones that were burned in the 1848 fire. In 1852, the first [[Great Allentown Fair|Allentown Fair]], now one of the nation's longest continual annual fairs, was held.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="LCHS1"/>

On April 13, 1861, with tensions between the nation's [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] and [[Confederate States of America|South]] intensifying following the [[Origins of the American Civil War|South's secession]] and the Confederate [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack on Fort Sumter]], residents of Lehigh and Northampton counties called a public meeting in [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]] to take steps to support the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=History of the Counties of Lehigh and Carbon, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924028854201 |publisher=Everts & Richards |date=1884 |first1=Alfred |last1=Mathews |first2=Austin N. |last2=Hungerford}}</ref> At the meeting, citizens voted to establish and equip the [[1st Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment|1st Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry]], a new military unit, placing Captain Samuel Yohe of Easton and Thomas W. Lynn in charge and awarding them the respective ranks of colonel and major. Tilghman H. Good of [[South Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania|South Whitehall Township]], previously captain of the Allentown militia known as the Allen Rifles and commander of the [[4th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment]], was placed in charge of the 1st Pennsylvania's Company I, which included his former Allen Rifles subordinates and members of the Jordan Artillerist, another Allentown-based militia.

In April 1861, these Allentown units were deployed in response to [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|President Lincoln's call]] for 75,000 volunteers to defend the national capital in [[Washington, D.C.]], following the Confederate bombardment of Fort Sumter.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A history of Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, from the earliest settlements to the present time, including much valuable information for the use of schools, families, libraries |url=https://archive.org/details/historyoflehighc00hause |publisher=Allentown, Pa., Jacks, the printer |date=1902 |first=James Joseph |last=Hauser}}</ref>

After the Civil War's end, many of these soldiers were named [[Pennsylvania First Defenders]] in recognition of their role as one the first five units to answer Lincoln's call for volunteers to defend the national capital. After protecting Washington, D.C., from April to July 1861, they were honorably discharged and returned home. However, a significant number of them reenlisted with the [[Union Army]] to defend the nation amidst the Civil War's escalation.<ref name="bicen" /><ref>{{Cite book |title=The Penn Germania ...: A Popular Journal of German History and Ideals in the United States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SDFEAQAAMAAJ |publisher=P.C.

====Industrialization====

[[File:1950 Hamilton Street 500 Block looking West.jpg|thumb|West Hamilton and 6th streets in Allentown in 1950]]
Beginning in the late 18th century, the city began to slowly grow as a hub for commerce and industrialization and as a [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial-era]] population center. Prior to the American Revolution, there were 54 homes in Northampton Towne and approximately 330 residents. In 1782, there were 59 houses and over 100 cows were stabled in the town. The town was described by a visitor in 1783, "One gets a glimpse of many good stone houses, many of them very neat, and everything about the premises shows good order and attention. The people are mainly [[Germans|German]] who speak bad English and distressing [[German language|German]]." In 1795, the ''U.S. Gazetteer'' described Allentown as: <blockquote>A handsome and flourishing town of Northampton County, pleasantly situated on the point of land formed by the junction of the [[Jordan Creek (Pennsylvania)|Jordan Creek]] and [[Little Lehigh Creek|Little Lehigh]]. It is regularly laid out and contains about ninety dwellings, a [[Protestantism in Germany|German Lutheran]] and a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] (Zion) Church, an Academy and three merchant mills.<ref name="bicen"/></blockquote>

In 1792, land north of Allentown was purchased by [[Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company]] for [[coal mining]], but it initially proved difficult to transport the region's high quality [[anthracite|anthracite coal]] over the primitive trail system that then existed, resulting in only a limited amount of anthracite being mined until 1818, when the company began constructing the [[Lehigh Canal]] to transport coal from [[Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania|Mauch Chunk]], later renamed Jim Thorpe, down the [[Lehigh River]] to the river's confluence with the [[Delaware River]] in [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]].

The opening of [[Lehigh Canal]] in 1818 quickly transformed Allentown and the surrounding [[Lehigh Valley]] from a rural agricultural area dominated by [[German language|German]]-speaking people into one of America's first urbanized industrialized areas and expanded the city's commercial and industrial capacity. With this, Allentown underwent significant [[Industrialisation|industrialization]], ultimately becoming a major center for heavy industry and manufacturing.

Allentown's industrial development accelerated in the late 18th century. David Deshler, Allentown's first shopkeeper, opened a [[sawmill]] in the city in 1782. By 1814, industrial plants in Allentown included flour mills, sawmills, two saddle makers, a tannery and tan yard, a woolen mill, a card weaving plant, two gunsmiths, two tobacconists, two clockmakers, and two printers.<ref name="bicen"/> In 1855, the first railroads to reach Allentown were opened, presenting the Lehigh Canal with direct competition for coal transport. [[Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad]] ordered four locomotives, and train stations were built in Allentown, [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]], and [[Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania|Mauch Chunk]]. In September 1855, the railroad became operational with the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] providing transport between Allentown and [[New York City]]. Transport between Allentown and [[Philadelphia]] was made available through Perkiomen Railroad, which operated between [[Norristown, Pennsylvania|Norristown]] and [[Freemansburg, Pennsylvania|Freemansburg]].<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="BOT"/>

In the 1840s, [[iron ore]] beds were discovered in hills around Allentown, and a furnace was constructed in 1846 by Allentown Iron Core Company for production of [[pig iron]], a [[intermediate good|vital component]] used in the [[Steelmaking|manufacturing of steel]]. The furnace opened in 1847 under supervision of Samuel Lewis, an expert in [[Ferrous metallurgy|iron production]], and was followed by the opening of other Allentown plants for production of a wide variety of metal products. In 1860, several smaller iron companies merged to create the Allentown Rolling Mill Company, which became Allentown's largest iron company and contributed to the city and the greater [[Lehigh Valley]] region's emergence as a major source for iron ore.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="BOT"/>

In 1850, [[Leh's]], a shoe and [[ready-to-wear]] clothing store, was opened in the city by Henry Leh. By 1861, with the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] commencing, Leh's emerged as a major source of military boots for the [[Union Army]]. In addition to Leh's, eight brick yards, a saw mill, a paint factory, two additional shoe factories, a piano factory, flour mills, breweries, and distilleries all opened in Allentown during the Civil War era.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="BOT"/><ref name="LCHS1"/>

In 1883, Allentown Boiler Works was founded in Allentown by Charles Collum. Collum and his partner John D. Knouse built a large facility at 3rd and Gordon streets in Allentown's First Ward near the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] yard near what later became Kline's Island. The company manufactured iron products, some of which were used in the construction of high-profile construction projects, including the building of the [[White House]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the [[United States Military Academy|U.S. Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York|West Point]]. The company's boilers and [[kilns]] were used for the production of iron products sold nationally and internationally, including to customers in [[Canada]], [[Cuba]], and the [[Philippines]].<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="BOT"/>

[[Brickworks]] flourished in Allentown through the end of [[World War I]]. The [[clay]] unearthed in various sections of Allentown and the city's suburbs proved suitable in manufacturing building brick and [[fire brick]]. Bricks were the first Allentown products shipped by rail and sold nationally.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="BOT"/> A vibrant food processing industry began emerging in Allentown following the arrival of predominantly [[Germans|German]] immigrant bakers, who were among Allentown's first settlers. In 1887, Wilson Arbogast and Morris C. Bastian formed Arbogast and Bastian, which provided large scale commercial slaughtering.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="LCHS1"/>

With industrialization, Allentown emerged as a major regional and national center for banking and finance. In 1860, William H. Ainey founded Allentown Savings and served as its first president. In 1864, Second National Bank of Allentown was formed, and Ainey was elected its first president, a position he held until his death. Ainey contributed to Allentown's industrial and retail growth, helping finance Iowa Barb Wire Company, which was later absorbed by [[AK Steel Holding|American Steel & Wire]], Pioneer Silk Factory, Palace Silk Mill, and Allentown Spinning Company.<ref name="LCHS1"/>

In the late 1870s, Allentown's iron industry collapsed, leaving the city economically depressed. Efforts were made to diversify the city's industrial base, including convincing [[Phoenix Manufacturing Company]] to open a [[silk]] mill in Allentown. Adelaide Mill at Race and Court streets prompted the opening of Pioneer Silk Mill in 1886, and the city quickly emerged as a national leader in silk manufacturing. The silk industry grew to ultimately become Allentown's largest industry in the late 19th century and remained the city's largest industry through the end of the 20th century. In 1914, there were 26 silk mills in the city. By 1928, after the introduction of [[rayon]], the number of Allentown silk mills grew to 85, and over 10,000 people were employed in the Allentown silk industry at the industry's height in the 1940s.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="LCHS1"/>

In 1896, Max Hess, a retailer from [[Perth Amboy, New Jersey]], visited Allentown and set about developing Allentown's first department store. He and his brother Charles opened [[Hess's|Hess Brothers]] at 9th and [[Hamilton Street|Hamilton]] streets. Hess's developed a reputation for flamboyance, offering the latest European fashion apparel. The opening of Hess's was following by the opening of a second major department store in the city, the Zollinger-Harned Company, located in the [[Zollinger-Harned Company Building]] on Hamilton Street.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="LCHS1"/>

In the late 19th century, Allentown also emerged as a major center for the beer [[brewing]] industry. Notable Allentown [[brewery|breweries]] included Horlacher Brewery (founded 1897, closed 1978),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.falstaffbrewing.com/horlacher.htm |title=Horlacher Brewing Company |access-date=June 1, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607155057/http://www.falstaffbrewing.com/horlacher.htm |archive-date=June 7, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Neuweiler Brewery]] (founded 1875, closed 1968),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pabreweryhistorians.tripod.com/neuweiler.html |title=Neuweiler Brewery |access-date=June 1, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622190943/http://pabreweryhistorians.tripod.com/neuweiler.html |archive-date=June 22, 2008}}</ref> and [[Schaefer Beer]], whose brewery was later acquired by [[Pabst Brewing Company|Pabst]] and [[Guinness]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.siteselection.com/ssinsider/pwatch/pw011203.htm |title=$44 Million Guinness Investment Will Create 250 Jobs at Pennsylvania Brewery |access-date=June 1, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629111341/http://www.siteselection.com/ssinsider/pwatch/pw011203.htm |archive-date=June 29, 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> and is now owned by [[Boston Beer Company]], brewer of [[Samuel Adams (beer)|Samuel Adams beer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.pennlive.com/lvbreakingnews/2007/08/sam_adams_purchases_upper_macu.html |title=Sam Adams purchases Upper Macungie Twp. plant for $55 M |access-date=January 12, 2011 |date=August 3, 2007 |archive-date=March 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322014027/http://blog.pennlive.com/lvbreakingnews/2007/08/sam_adams_purchases_upper_macu.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

===20th century===
In 1905, Jack and Gus Mack moved [[Mack Trucks]], their motor company, from [[Brooklyn]] to Allentown, taking over the foundries of Weaver-Hirsh on South 10th Street. By 1914, Mack Trucks developed a global reputation for manufacturing sturdy and reliable trucks and vehicles. Many were sent to [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] battlefields in France prior to the U.S. formally entering [[World War I]] in 1917. The British nicknamed [[Mack AC]]'s five and seven-ton trucks the "Bulldog". Mack eventually grew to have eight manufacturing plants in Allentown and adopted the bulldog as it corporate brand.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="LCHS1"/>

Beginning in the early 20th century, [[Syria]]n Christians from the region of [[Wadi al-Nasara]] ('the Christian Valley') began settling in Allentown, initially the result of missionary activity in their villages by Pennsylvanian missionaries. The Syrian community eventually became a significant component of the city, largely concentrated in Allentown's Sixth Ward.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Richardson |first1=E.

Like several other regions in Pennsylvania, Allentown residents continued speaking [[Pennsylvania Dutch language|Pennsylvania German]] well into the early 20th century. [[American Guide Series|Pennsylvania Guide]], compiled by the [[Federal Writers' Project|Writers' Project]] of the [[Works Progress Administration]], described the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] community's impact on Allentown's linguistic landscape, reporting in 1940 that:<ref>{{Cite book |title=Pennsylvania: A Guide to the Keystone State |last=Federal Writers' Project |date=1940 |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=1st |page=182 |location=New York}}</ref>{{Blockquote
|text=Allentown is among the few large Pennsylvania cities where newspapers still carry columns written in the dialect. Although English predominates on the streets, there is a tendency to enunciate the 'v' with open lips, to soften the hard 'g' into 'ch,' and to use too frequently such words as 'already,' 'yet,' and 'once.' Here also are heard such colloquialisms as 'the pie is all,' (all gone) and 'it wonders (mystifies) me.'

In October 1945, following the end of [[World War II]], [[Western Electric]] opened a plant on Union Boulevard in Allentown. Six years later, on October 1, 1951, the company manufactured and released the world's first [[transistor]], which was produced at the Allentown-based plant, and the Allentown-based company emerged as a leader in the nation's [[Aftermath of World War II|post-war]] electronics revolution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.mcall.com/1995-10-08/business/3069670_1_new-location-western-s-electric-s-50th-full-story |title=At&t Decided To Bring High Tech 50 Years Ago |website=mcall.com |access-date=October 23, 2017 |archive-date=November 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117013920/http://articles.mcall.com/1995-10-08/business/3069670_1_new-location-western-s-electric-s-50th-full-story |url-status=dead}}</ref>

By the mid-20th century, Allentown was a major retailing and entertainment center distinct and separate from [[Philadelphia]] and [[New York City]]. Hess's, Leh's, and Zollinger department stores led to retail sector growth in Allentown, and dozens of smaller retail stores, restaurants, hotels, banks, and professional offices in the city emerged in present-day [[Center City Allentown|Center City]], which was then referred to as downtown Allentown. At least seven cinemas and stage theaters were developed on Hamilton Street between 5th and 10th streets.<ref name="bicen"/><ref name="LCHS1"/>

====Deindustrialization and Rust Belt====
{{Further|Deindustrialization|Rust Belt}}
[[File:1974 - Hamilton Mall Postcard.jpg|thumb|A 1974 postcard of Hamilton Mall in [[Center City Allentown|Center City]], an ultimately failed attempt to redevelop Allentown's central business district as residents began fleeing the city for its suburbs in the 1970s]]
[[File:2018 - Center Square - Looking Northeast - 12 Oct - Allentown PA.jpg|thumb|The entrance to [[PPL Center]] (on left) in Center City in October 2018]]
By the mid-1960s, Allentown's economy had been booming for decades but the city's rising taxes and regulations prohibiting expansion of the city's geographic limits began leading many of the city's residents, especially those in the post-[[World War II]] [[baby boomers|baby boom generation]], to flee Allentown for its suburbs. [[Salisbury Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Salisbury]], [[South Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania|South Whitehall]], and [[Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania|Whitehall]] townships each had large areas of farmland that were prime locations for residential real estate development. Much of Allentown's [[working class]] began migrating to these newer, less-expensive housing developments in Allentown's suburbs, which offered lower taxes, more green space, less crime, and newer schools.

This demographic trend continued throughout the latter part of the 20th century, presenting a major challenge to Allentown's city government and the [[Allentown School District]] as it confronted greatly diminished resources. Allentown School District's financial challenges, in turn, further increased the working class flight to Allentown's suburbs, creating a sea change in the city's demographics. With the departure of many working-class families from older [[Center City Allentown|Center City]] [[List of Allentown neighborhoods|neighborhoods]], many homes were sold to landlords who converted them into inexpensive multifamily apartments, many of which became [[Section 8 (housing)|government-subsidized housing projects]] that were permitted under the city's lax zoning and city codes.

With Allentown's neighborhoods and school system declining, the city focused on attempting to develop its [[Hamilton Street]] retail district, largely ignoring Allentown neighborhoods not located in Center City. This also exacerbated the flight of Allentown families to the city's suburbs, leading to the development of shopping centers and services to accommodate the demand in these expanding suburban communities. In 1966, [[Whitehall Mall]], the first closed shopping mall north of Philadelphia, opened in Whitehall Township.

Ten years later, in 1976, the even larger [[Lehigh Valley Mall]] opened north of [[U.S. Route 22 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 22]] in [[Fullerton, Pennsylvania|Fullerton]]. Stores in Allentown's downtown shopping district began closing, replaced with stores whose customers were less affluent. Large areas of Allentown's downtown were subsequently razed and replaced with parking lots. The downtown business district was rebuilt in an attempt to compete with the newer suburban shopping locations. A multiblock row of stores known as Hamilton Mall was developed, featuring newly covered sidewalks and managed traffic patterns. But the effort was unsuccessful, and two of the city's major department stores, Leh's and Zollingers, were forced to close by 1990. The third, Hess's, was sold to [[The Bon-Ton]] in 1994, which closed its Hamilton Mall location two years later in 1996.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allentownpa.gov/Play/History |title=History |website=allentownpa.gov |access-date=October 23, 2017 |archive-date=October 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024154418/https://www.allentownpa.gov/Play/History |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1993, the Corporate Center, the city's new flagship business center on North 7th Street, fell victim to a large [[sinkhole]], which led to its condemnation and ultimate demolition.

===21st century===
{{See also|Economy of Allentown, Pennsylvania|Neighborhood Improvement Zone}}
Combined with challenges confronting [[Center City Allentown|Center City]], the manufacturing economy of the [[Northeastern United States]] began suffering from [[deindustrialization]] associated with foreign competition, trade policies, and manufacturing costs. Many Allentown factories and corporations began closing or relocating.

Responding to the late 20th century economic downturn, Allentown consciously sought to begin diversifying its economy in the early 21st century. In the 2000s and 2010s, [[Economy of Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown's economy]] saw growth in its service, health care, transportation, warehousing, and some manufacturing industries. In 2009, the [[Neighborhood Improvement Zone|Neighborhood Improvement Zone (NIZ)]], created by the [[Pennsylvania State Legislature]], sought to address Allentown's economic challenges and encourage its development and revitalization. The NIZ includes approximately {{convert|128|acres|abbr=off}} in Center City and the city's riverfront district on the [[Lehigh River]]'s western side.

In 2006, [[Agere Systems]], formerly [[Western Electric]], was acquired by [[LSI Corporation]] and relocated to [[San Jose, California]]. [[Mack Trucks]] relocated to [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], in 2009, and other Allentown-based factories downsized considerably or ceased operations entirely. With the city's manufacturing base eroded, once high-paying industrial jobs were replaced with lower-paying service sector jobs, and Allentown began being cited widely as one of the most prominent examples of a late 20th century [[Rust Belt]] city.

In 2014, Center City underwent major restructuring, including constructing and opening [[PPL Center]], a 10,500-capacity indoor arena that now hosts the [[Lehigh Valley Phantoms]], a professional [[American Hockey League]] ice hockey team, and other sports, entertainment, and concert events. A full-service [[Renaissance Hotels|Renaissance Hotel]] also opened, and older office buildings were redeveloped.<ref name="NIZ">{{cite web |url=http://www.allentownpa.gov/Neighborhood-Improvement-Zone |title=Neighborhood Improvement Zone |website=allentownpa.gov |access-date=October 23, 2017 |archive-date=October 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024154423/https://www.allentownpa.gov/Neighborhood-Improvement-Zone |url-status=live}}</ref>

Allentown is characterized by a large stock of historic homes, commercial structures, and century-old industrial buildings reflecting its standing as one of the nation's earliest urban centers. [[Center City Allentown|Center City]]'s neighborhoods include [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] and [[Terraced house|terraced rowhouses]]. West Park includes mostly Victorian and [[American Craftsman]]-style architecture. Houses on Allentown's tree-lined streets in the West End were built mostly between the 1920s and 1940s. Houses in Allentown's East and South Sides are a mixture of architectural styles and are generally single and twin family homes built between the 1940s and 1960s; both areas include some older Victorian homes. Allentown has many [[loft|loft apartments]] in converted mills and historic brick manufacturing buildings and modern and historic high-rise apartment buildings in Center City.

Allentown has three primary historic districts: Old Allentown, the Old Fairgrounds, and West Park. Old Allentown and Old Fairgrounds are Center City neighborhoods that hold a joint house tour organized by the Old Allentown Preservation Association (OAPA) annually in September. West Park also offers a tour of its Victorian and Craftsman-style homes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldallentown.org/ |title=Home |website=oldallentown.org |access-date=October 23, 2017 |archive-date=October 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024095825/http://www.oldallentown.org/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[PPL Building]], at 2 North 9th Street, is Allentown's tallest building at {{convert|322|ft|m}}. The building was designed by [[New York City]] architectural firm Helme, Corbett, and Harrison. [[Wallace Harrison]] was the primary designer of the building, which later served as a prototype for the [[Art Deco architecture of New York City|Art Deco]] architecture of [[Rockefeller Center]] and other New York City building structures. Built between 1926 and 1928, the PPL Building's exterior decorative friezes were designed by [[Alexander Archipenko]]. The building, which opened July 16, 1928,<ref>Ann Bartholomew (Author), Carol M. Front (Author) (2002), Allentown (Images of America), Arcadia Publishing (April 8, 2002), {{ISBN|0738509965}}, p. 38</ref> has been illuminated every night since its opening. In clear weather at night, the PPL Building's nighttime illumination can be seen from as far north as the [[Blue Mountain Resort|Blue Mountain Ski Area]] in [[Palmerton, Pennsylvania|Palmerton]].

[[Miller Symphony Hall]] at 23 North 6th Street opened in 1896 and served initially as the city's public market; the 1,100 seat facility is now home to the [[Allentown Symphony Orchestra]]. The structure was converted to a theater in 1899 by architect [[J. B. McElfatrick]]'s firm, and was initially named the Lyric Theater. Miller Symphony Hall, one of roughly a dozen famous McElfatrick designs still standing in the nation, has been used for burlesque shows, vaudeville, silent films, symphony orchestras, and other entertainment for over a century.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080213094212/http://www.allentownsymphony.org/ABOUTSYMPHONYHALL/tabid/192/Default.aspx "About Symphony Hall"].

Several local churches make and sell [[Fasnacht (doughnut)|fastnachts]] in fundraisers for [[Shrove Tuesday|Fastnacht Day]], the day before [[Lent]]'s commencement.

As Allentown's population has increased over the decades, many national [[List of restaurant chains in the United States|restaurant]] and [[List of fast food restaurants#United States|fast food]] chains have established a presence in the city. Growth of the city's ethnic populations has led to the opening of many family-run restaurants specializing in ethnic cuisine, including Chinese, Colombian, Dominican, Italian, Japanese, Mexican, Lebanese, Portuguese, Puerto Rican, Thai, and West Indian restaurants.

Due in part to Allentown's proximity to Philadelphia, [[cheesesteaks]] are immensely popular. [[Yocco's Hot Dogs]], a regionally well-known [[hot dog]] and cheesesteak establishment with four area locations, two of which are in Allentown, was founded in 1922 by Theodore Iacocca, uncle of former [[Chrysler]] chairman and president [[Lee Iacocca]].
