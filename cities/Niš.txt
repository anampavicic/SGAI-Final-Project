After about 400 years of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, the city was liberated in 1878 and became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia|Principality of Serbia]], though not without great bloodshed—remnants of which can be found throughout the city. Today, Niš is one of the most important economic centers in Serbia, especially in the electronics, mechanical engineering, textile, and tobacco industries. [[Niš Constantine the Great Airport|Constantine the Great Airport]] is Niš's international airport. The city is also the seat of the [[University of Niš]], the [[Eparchy of Niš]] and the Command of [[Serbian Army]].

In 2013, the city was host to the celebration of 1700 years of Constantine's [[Edict of Milan]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=50174 | title=Moderate Patriarch Sets New Course for Serb Church | publisher=IPS News | date=February 1, 2010 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210062019/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=50174 | archive-date=February 10, 2010 }}</ref>

Naissus was first mentioned in Roman documents near the beginning of the 2nd century CE, and was considered a place worthy of note in the ''Geography'' of [[Ptolemy]] of Alexandria.{{cn|date=December 2023}}

Constantine created the [[Dacia Mediterranea]] province, of which Naissus was the capital, which also included [[Remesiana]] on the [[Via Militaris]] and the towns of [[Pautalia]] and Germania. He lived in Naissus briefly from 316 to 322.<ref>Pannonia and Upper Moesia: a history of the middle Danube provinces [https://books.google.com/books?id=6L49AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA51 p.51]</ref>

The city was of great importance for the [[Constantinian dynasty]]. It is the birthplace of [[Constantine the Great]] who turned it from a middle-sized town to a large city with many public buildings. The city flourished greatly in the Constantinian period. A bronze bust of Constantine decorated city. It was his temporary residence and the city where he promulgated many laws, preserved in the [[Theodosian code]]. In Constantinian narratives, Naissus was the city where the usurper [[Vetranio]] abdicated to [[Constantius II]] after a powerful speech he gave to the rebel armies. [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], the last Constantinian emperor, used Naissus, which had arms factories, as his base in the civil war and recruited [[Illyrians]] and others as soldiers for his campaign.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kaegi |first1=Walter Emil |title=The Emperor Julian at Naissus |journal=L'Antiquité Classique |date=1975 |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=163–65 |doi=10.3406/antiq.1975.1770 |jstor=41650264 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/41650264}}</ref>

In 364 AD, the imperial Villa [[Mediana]] {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} was the site where emperors Valentinian and Valens met and divided the Roman Empire into halves which they would rule as co-emperors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/gibbon/02/daf02049.htm |title=Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol. 2: Chapter XXV: Reigns Of Jovian And Valentinian, Division Of The Empire.

It was besieged by the [[Huns]] in 441 and devastated in 448, and again in 480 when the partially-rebuilt town was demolished by the [[Barbarians]]. Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian I]] restored the town but it was destroyed by the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] once again. The [[Slavs]], in their campaign against Byzantium, conquered Niš and settled here in 540.

===Ottoman period===
The fall of the [[Serbian Empire]], which was conquered by Ottoman Sultan [[Murad I]] in 1385, decided the fate of Niš as well. After a 25-day-long siege the city fell to the Ottomans. It was returned to Serbian rule in 1443. Niš again fell under Ottoman rule in 1448, and remained thusly for 241 years. During Ottoman rule Niš was a seat of the empire's military and civil administration. A [[Silesia]]n traveler stated in 1596 that the route from Sofia to Niš was littered with corpses and described the gates of Niš as bedecked with the freshly-severed heads of poor Bulgarian peasants.<ref>{{cite book|title=Kultur der Nationen|page=110|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDAPAQAAIAAJ&q=friedrich+seidel+nis|language=de}}</ref> In 1689, Niš was seized by the Austrian army during the [[Great Turkish War]], but the Ottomans regained it in 1690. In 1737, Niš was [[Siege of Niş (1737)|again seized by the Austrians]], who attempted to rebuild the fortifications around the city. The same year, the Ottomans reclaimed the city without resistance. The existing fortification is of Ottoman Turkish origin, dating from the first decades of the 18th century (1719–1723). It is well known as one of the most significant and best preserved monuments of this kind in the mid-Balkans. The Fortress was erected on the site of earlier fortifications – the ancient Roman, Byzantine, and later yet Medieval forts. <ref>{{Cite web |title=NİŞ |url=https://islamansiklopedisi.org.tr/nis |access-date=2023-12-08 |website=TDV İslâm Ansiklopedisi |language=tr}}</ref>

During the [[First Serbian uprising]] in 1809, Serbian revolutionaries attempted to liberate Niš in the [[Battle of Čegar]].

==Economy==
The city of Niš is the administrative, industrial, commercial, financial and cultural center of the south-eastern part of Republic of Serbia. The position of Niš is strategically important, at the intersection of European highway and railway networks connecting Europe with Asia. Niš is easily accessible, having an airport – [[Niš Constantine the Great Airport]] and being a point of intersection of numerous railroad and highway lines.

It is in Niš that the trunk road running from the north down the [[Great Morava|Morava River]] valley forks into two major lines:

* the south one, leading to [[Thessalonica]] and [[Athens]], along the [[Vardar]] River valley,
* and the east one, running along the [[Nisava|Nišava]] and the [[Maritsa|Marica]], leading towards Sofia and Istanbul, and further on, towards the Near East.

These roads have been widely known from ancient times, because they represented the beaten tracks along which peoples, goods and armies moved. Known as 'Via Militaris' in [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine]] periods, or 'Constantinople road' in Middle Ages, these roads still represent major European traffic arteries. Niš thus stands at a point of intersection of the roads connecting Asia Minor to Europe, and the [[Black Sea]] to the Mediterranean. Nis had been a relatively developed city in the former Yugoslavia. In 1981, its GDP per capita was 110% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book|title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju|year=1984|edition=3rd|publisher=Sveučilišna naklada Liber|location=Zagreb|language=hr|editor1-first=Radovan|editor1-last=Radovinović|editor2-first=Ivan|editor2-last=Bertić}}</ref>

Niš is one of the most important industrial centers in Serbia, well known for its tobacco, electronics, construction, mechanical-engineering, textile, nonferrous-metal, food-processing and rubber-goods industries.

Among the manufacturing companies which had a huge impact during the second half of the 20th century on Niš's development are: [[EI Niš]] (electronics industry), [[Mašinska Industrija Niš|Mechanical Industry Niš]], "Građevinar" (construction company), [[Philip Morris Operations|Niš Tobacco Factory]], "Nitex – Niš" (textile industry), "Niš Brewery" (beverages) and "Žitopek" (bakery). Other prominent companies which went bankrupt during the 1990s and 2000s are: "Vulkan" (rubber-goods manufacturer), "NISSAL" (nonferrous-metal industry).

Prominent tobacco manufacturer "Niš Tobacco Factory" was sold to [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]] in August 2003 for 518 million euros, while Nitex was sold to [[Benetton Group]].<ref name="filipmoris2003">{{cite news |title="Filip Moris" kupuje DIN, BAT kupuje DIV |url=https://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2003&mm=08&dd=05&nav_category=9&nav_id=115924 |access-date=October 18, 2018 |work=b92.net |date=August 5, 2003 |language=sr}}</ref> In recent years, [[Integrated Micro-Electronics, Inc.]], [[Yura Corporation d.o.o.|Yura Corporation]], [[Zumtobel Group]], [[Johnson Electric]] and Shinwon opened their plants in Niš. Currently, Chinese manufacturer, Xingyu automotive systems, is building its factory.

In former Electronic and Mechanical Industry complexes, many smaller manufacturers opened their plants.

In 2019, companies with highest operating income were [[Philip Morris International]], with over 190,000,000 Euros and [[Johnson Electric]] with over 140,000,000 Euros.<ref>https://investnis.rs/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Nacrt20Plana20Razvoja20Grada20Nisa20JAVNI20UVID.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref>

==Transportation==
Niš is strategically between the [[Morava (river)|Morava]] river valley in North and the [[Vardar]] river valley in the south, on the main route between Greece and Central Europe. In the Niš area, this major transportation and communication route is linked with the natural corridor formed by the [[Nišava]] river valley, which runs Eastwards in the direction of [[Sofia]] and [[Istanbul]]. The city has been a passing station for the [[Orient Express]].

The first highways date back to the 1950s when Niš was linked with capital Belgrade through the [[Brotherhood and Unity Highway]], the first in Southeastern Europe.

Historically, because of its location, the city had always great importance in the region. The first to take advantage of it was the [[Roman Empire]] that built the important road [[Via Militaris]], linking the city with ''Singidunum'' (current Belgrade) to the North and ''Constantinople'' (current Istanbul) to the southeast.
