'''Tubarão''' (lit. "[[shark]]") is a Brazilian [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] located in southern part of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] state. The population, according to the IBGE/2020 estimate was 106,422.  It is the main city of the [[Tubarão River]] [[Drainage basin|basin]] region, which comprises 20 municipalities and has a population of 350,000.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2020}}

Tubarão was named after a native tribal chief called Tubanharô, which means "ferocious father" in [[Guarani language|Guaraní]] language. Thus, it does not have any relation to the word tubarão ("shark" in Portuguese).

The first settlement, which later became the city, was founded in 1773 by troopers as a halfway point between [[Laguna, Santa Catarina|Laguna]] and the uplands.

[[Coal]] was discovered in Tubarão outskirts in the 18th century.

The city emancipated from Laguna in 1870.

In the following years [[Italian people|Italian]] and [[Germans|German]] [[immigrants]] came to this region.

The [[Tereza Christina Railway]] was inaugurated in 1884.

One of the worst natural catastrophes in Brazil took place in Tubarão, on March 28, 1974.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-07-26 |title=Enchente de 74 é relembrada em evento em Tubarão – Defesa Civil de SC |url=https://www.defesacivil.sc.gov.br/noticias/enchente-de-74-e-relembrada-em-evento-em-tubarao/ |access-date=2024-07-29 |language=pt-BR}}</ref> The Tubarão River waters [[flood]]ed about 80% of the urban area. The disaster caused 199 fatalities and left about 45,000 people homeless.

==Geography==

The city is located 133 kilometers south of [[Florianópolis]], the state capital, in the South Brazilian coast plains. Its urban area is crossed by the Tubarão River and, in parallel, the BR-101 federal highway. Some lakes and swamp areas are found in the surrounding areas, although its landscape has been modified several times by human activity. The [[climate]] is subtropical ([[Köppen climate classification]]).

Neighbor cities are Laguna, Capivari de Baixo, Gravatal, Pedras Grandes, Jaguaruna, São Ludgero, Orleans and Treze de Maio.

==Economy==

The main economy is based on [[agriculture]] (rice plantations), [[furniture]] industry and [[ceramic]] tiles. [[Tourism]] is also important due to its thermal water resources in Rio do Pouso and Guarda da Margem Esquerda localities.
