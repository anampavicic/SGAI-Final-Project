==History==

===Early history===
Changchun was initially established on imperial decree as a small trading post and frontier village during the reign of the [[Jiaqing Emperor]] in the [[Qing dynasty]]. Trading activities mainly involved furs and other natural products during this period. In 1800, the Jiaqing Emperor selected a small village on the east bank of the [[Yitong River]] and named it "Changchun Ting".<ref>{{Nihongo2|新京特別市公署『新京市政概要』12–13頁、新京商工公会刊『新京の概況 建国十周年記念發刊』1–7頁、『満洲年鑑』昭和20年（康徳12年）版 389–390頁、他を参照。}}{{full citation needed|date=August 2019}}</ref>

At the end of the 18th century peasants from overpopulated provinces such as [[Shandong]] and [[Hebei]] began to settle in the region. In 1889, the village was promoted into a city known as "Changchun Fu".<ref name="History ">{{cite web|url=http://en.changchun.gov.cn/sq/ls/ |title=History |publisher=Changchun Municipal Government |access-date=23 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512084320/http://en.changchun.gov.cn/sq/ls/ |archive-date=12 May 2012 }}</ref>

===Railway era===
In May 1898, Changchun got its first railway station, located in [[Kuancheng District|Kuancheng]], part of the railway from [[Harbin]] to [[Lüshun]] (the southern branch of the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]]), constructed by the [[Russian Empire]].<ref name=cctv>{{cite web|last1=Zhiting|first1=Li|title=Changchun II- Le chemin de fer de Changchun|url=http://www.cctv.com/program/lachine/20050628/101794.shtml|website=cctv.com-Francais|access-date=17 October 2014|language=fr|date=28 June 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923225931/http://www.cctv.com/program/lachine/20050628/101794.shtml|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

===City planning and development from 1906 to 1931===
[[File:Changchun 1932 - Plan 2.jpg|thumb|left|City planning map of Changchun, 1932]]

The [[Treaty of Portsmouth]] formally ended the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 and saw the transfer and assignment to the [[Empire of Japan]] in 1906 the railway between Changchun and Port Arthur, and all its branches.<ref>Akira Koshizawa, Manchukuo Capital Planning (Jiangsu: Social Sciences Academic Press,2011), 26–97.</ref>

Having realized the strategic importance of Changchun's location with respect to Japan, China and Russia, the Japanese Government sent a group of planners and engineers to Changchun to determine the best site for a new railway station.{{cn|date=October 2024}}

Without the consent of the Chinese Government, Japan purchased or seized from local farmers the land on which the Changchun Railway Station was to be constructed as the centre of the South Manchuria Railway Affiliated Areas (SMRAA).<ref>Yishi Liu, "A Pictorial History of Changchun, 1898–1962," Cross Current 5, (2012): 191–217.</ref> In order to turn Changchun into the centre for extracting the agricultural and mineral resources of Manchuria, Japan developed a blueprint for Changchun and invested heavily in the construction of the city.{{cn|date=October 2024}}

At the beginning of 1907, as the prelude to, and preparation for, the invasion and occupation of China, Japan initiated the planning programme of the SMRAA, which embodied distinctive colonial characteristics. The guiding ideology of the overall design was to build a high standard colonial city with sophisticated facilities, multiple functions and a large scale.{{cn|date=October 2024}}

Accordingly, nearly ¥7 million on average was allocated on a year-by-year basis for urban planning and construction during the period 1907 to 1931.<ref name="Akira Koshizawa 2011">Akira Koshizawa, Manchukuo Capital Planning (Jiangsu: Social Sciences Academic Press,2011), 26–97</ref>

The comprehensive plan was to ensure the comfort required by Japanese employees on Manchurian Railways, build up Changchun into a base for Japanese control of the whole Manchuria in order to provide an effective counterweight to Russia in this area of China.{{cn|date=October 2024}}

The city's role as a rail hub was underlined in its planning and construction, the main design concepts of which read as follows: under conventional grid pattern terms, two geoplagiotropic boulevards were newly carved eastward and westward from the grand square of the new railway station. The two helped form two intersections with the gridded prototypes, which led to two circles of South and West. The two sub-civic centres served as axes on which eight radial roads were blazed that took the shape of a sectoral structure.{{cn|date=October 2024}}

At that time, the radial circles and the design concept of urban roads were quite advanced and scientific. It activated to great extent the serious urban landscapes as well as clearly identifying the traditional gridded pattern.{{By whom|date=January 2021}}

With the new Changchun railway station as its centre, the urban plan divided the SMRAA into various specified areas: residential quarters 15%, commerce 33%, grain depot 19%, factories 12%, public entertainment 9%, and administrative organs (including a Japanese garrison) 12%.<ref name="Akira Koshizawa 2011"/> Each block provided the railway station with supporting and systematic services dependent on its own functions.

In the meantime, a comprehensive system of judiciary and military police was established which was totally independent of China. That accounted for the widespread nature of military facilities within the urban construction area of {{convert|3.967|km2|abbr=on}}, such as the railway garrison, the gendarmerie and the police department, with its 18 local police stations.<ref name="Akira Koshizawa 2011"/>

Perceiving Changchun as a ''tabula rasa'' upon which to construct new and sweeping conceptions of the built environment, the Japanese used the city as a practical laboratory to create two distinct and idealized urban milieus, each appropriate to a particular era. From 1906 to 1931, Changchun served as a key [[railway town]] through which the Japanese orchestrated an informal empire. Between 1932 and 1945, the city became home to a grandiose new Asian capital. Yet, while the façades in the city and later the capital contrasted markedly, along with the attitudes of the state they upheld, the shifting styles of planning and architecture consistently attempted to represent Japanese rule as progressive, beneficent, and modern.{{By whom|date=January 2021}}

The development of Changchun, in addition to being driven by the railway system, suggested an important period of the Northeast modern architectural culture, reflecting Japanese urban design endeavours and revealing that county's ambition to invade and occupy China. [[Japanese architecture]] and [[Culture of Japan|culture]] had been widely applied to Manchukuo to highlight the special status of the Japanese puppet. Urban planning clearly stems from a culture, be it aggressive or creative. Changchun's planning and construction process serves as a good example.{{By whom|date=January 2021}}

Changchun expanded rapidly as the junction between of the Japanese-owned [[South Manchurian Railway]] and the Russian-owned [[Chinese Eastern Railway]], remaining the [[break of gauge]] point between the Russian and standard gauges into the 1930s,<ref>{{cite web|title=YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Gov06_08Rail-t1-body-d8-d6.html|publisher=Victoria University of Wellington|access-date=17 October 2014|page=30|date=1 April 1932|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528014039/http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Gov06_08Rail-t1-body-d8-d6.html|archive-date=28 May 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Manchukuo and World War II===
On 10 March 1932 the capital of [[Manchukuo]], a Japan-controlled puppet state in [[Manchuria]], was established in Changchun.<ref name="国務院布告第1号">{{Nihongo2|大同元年4月1日国務院佈告第1号「満洲国国都ヲ長春ニ奠ム」（大同元年3月10日）}}</ref> The city was then renamed '''Hsinking''' ({{zh|c=[[:zh:新京|新京]]|hp=Xīnjīng|w=Hsin-ching}}; [[Japanese language|Japanese]]:{{Nihongo|||Shinkyō|lead=yes}}; literally "New Capital") on 13 March.<ref name="国務院布告第2号">{{Nihongo2|大同元年4月1日国務院佈告第2号「国都長春ヲ新京ト命名ス」（大同元年3月14日）}}</ref> The Emperor [[Puyi]] resided in the Imperial Palace ({{zh|c=帝宮|hp=Dì gōng|links=no}}) which is now the [[Museum of the Imperial Palace of Manchukuo|Museum of the Manchu State Imperial Palace]].

Hsinking was a well-planned city with broad avenues and modern public works. The city underwent rapid expansion in both its economy and infrastructure. Many of buildings built during the Japanese colonial era still stand today, including those of the [[Eight Grand Ministries|Eight Major Bureaus of Manchukuo]] ({{zh|c=八大部|八大部|hp=Bādà bù|links=no}}) as well as the Headquarters of the Japanese [[Kwantung Army]].

====Construction of Hsinking====

[[File:Manchukuo Railmap en.png|thumb|Rail network of Manchukuo in 1945, which labeled Changchun as Xinjing]]
Hsinking was the only [[Direct-controlled municipality]] ({{lang|zh-hans|{{linktext|特别市}}}}) in Manchukuo after [[Harbin]] was incorporated into the jurisdiction of [[Binjiang Province]].<ref>{{Nihongo2|「特別市指定ニ関スル件廃止ニ関スル件」（康徳4年6月27日勅令第142号）}}</ref> In March 1932, the Inspection Division of South Manchuria Railway started to draw up the Metropolitan Plan of Great Hsinking ({{zh|s=大新京都市计画|t=大新京都市計畫|hp=Dà xīn jīngdū shì jìhuà|links=no}}). The Bureau of capital construction ({{zh|s=国都建设局|t=國都建設局|hp=Guódū jiànshè jú |labels=no}}) which was directly under the control of State Council of Manchukuo was established to take complete responsibility of the formulation and the implementation of the plan.<ref name="国都建設局"/> [[Kuniaki Koiso]], the Chief of Staff of the [[Kwantung Army]], and [[Yasuji Okamura]], the Vice Chief-of-Staff, finalized the plan of a {{convert|200|km2|abbr=on}} construction area. The Metropolitan Plan of Great Hsinking was influenced by the renovation plan of [[Paris]] in the 19th century, the [[garden city movement]], and theories of American cities' planning and design in the 1920s. The city development plan included extensive tree planting. By 1934 Hsinking was known as ''the Forest Capital'' with Jingyuetan Park built, which is now China's largest Plantation and a [[Tourist Attraction Rating Categories of China|AAAA-rated]] recreational area.<ref>{{cite web|script-title=ja:長春浄月潭|url=http://j.people.com.cn/94475/6932072.html|website=j.people.com.cn|publisher={{Nihongo2|人民網日本株式会社事業案内}}|access-date=17 October 2014|language=ja|date=26 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105105754/http://j.people.com.cn/94475/6932072.html|archive-date=5 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

In accordance with the Metropolitan Plan of Great Hsinking, the area of publicly shared land (including the Imperial Palace, government offices, roads, parks and athletic grounds) in Hsinking was {{convert|47|km2|abbr=on}}, whilst the area of residential, commercial and industrial developments was planned to be {{convert|53|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Nihongo2|新京特別市公署『新京市政概要』6頁}}{{full citation needed|date=February 2020}}</ref> However, Hsinking's population exceeded the prediction of 500,000 by 1940. In 1941, the Capital Construction Bureau modified the original plan, which expanded the urban area to {{convert|160|km2|abbr=on}}. The new plan also focused on the construction of satellite towns around the city with a planning of {{convert|200|m2|abbr=on}} land per capita.<ref name="国都建設局">{{Nihongo2|国務院国都建設局『國都大新京』（日譯）16頁}}{{full citation needed|date=February 2020}}</ref> Because the effects of war, the Metropolitan Plan of Great Hsinking remained unfinished. By 1944, the built up urban area of Hsinking reached {{convert|80|km2|abbr=on}}, while the area used for greening reached {{convert|70.7|km2|abbr=on}}. As Hsinking's city orientation was the administrative center and military commanding center, land for military use exceeded the originally planned figure of 9 percent, while only light manufacturing including packing industry, cigarette industry and paper-making had been developed during this period. Japanese force also controlled Hsinking's police system, instead of Manchukuo government.<ref name="首都警察">{{Nihongo2|首都警察廳正式成立ノ件（大同元年10月18日民政部訓令第286号）}}</ref> Major officers of Hsinking police were all ethnic Japanese.<ref>{{Nihongo2|後に「首都警察廳官制中改正ノ件」（康徳4年9月30日勅令第282号）により、新京特別市のみを管轄とした。}}</ref>

The population of Hsinking also experienced rapid growth after being established as the capital of Manchukuo. According to the census in 1934 taken by the police agency, the city's municipal area had 141,712 inhabitants.<ref>{{lang|zh-hant|新京特別市公署『新京市政概要』7頁}}{{full citation needed|date=February 2020}}</ref> By 1944 the city's population had risen to 863,607,<ref>{{lang|zh-hant|『満洲年鑑』昭和20年（康徳12年）版、1944年、389頁}}{{full citation needed|date=February 2020}}</ref> with 153,614 [[Japanese settlers in Manchuria|Japanese settlers]]. This population made Hsinking the third largest metropolitan city in Manchukuo after Mukden and Harbin, as the metropolitan mainly focused on military and political function.<ref>{{Nihongo2|『満洲年鑑』等では「新京市政公署」の記述も見られる。}}</ref>

Diseases were tested for use against Soviet and Chinese horses and other [[livestock]]. In addition to these tests, Unit 100 ran a bacteria factory to produce the pathogens needed by other units. Biological sabotage testing was also handled at this facility: everything from poisons to chemical crop destruction.

===Siege of Changchun===
