Novosibirsk was founded in 1893 on the Ob River crossing point of the future [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], where the [[Novosibirsk Rail Bridge]] was constructed. Originally named '''Novonikolayevsk'''{{efn|{{langx|ru|label=Pre-reform orthography|Ново-Николаевскъ}}, {{IPA|ru|ˈnovə nʲɪkɐˈla(j)ɪfsk|IPA}}}} ("New Nicholas") in honor of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Emperor Nicholas II]], the city rapidly grew into a major transport, commercial, and industrial hub. Novosibirsk was ravaged by the [[Russian Civil War]] but recovered during the early [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period and gained its present name, ''Novosibirsk'' ("New Siberia"), in 1926. Under the leadership of [[Joseph Stalin]], Novosibirsk became one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Following the outbreak of [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]], the city hosted many factories relocated from the [[European Russia|Russian core]].

Novosibirsk is home to many notable places such as the neo-Byzantine [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Novosibirsk|Alexander Nevsky Cathedral]], the [[Novosibirsk Opera and Ballet Theatre]], as well as the [[Novosibirsk Zoo]]. It is served by [[Tolmachevo Airport]], the busiest airport in Siberia.<ref>{{Cite web |title=European Airport Traffic Trends |url=http://www.anna.aero/european-airport-traffic-trends/ |access-date=22 June 2018 |website=Aviation database bank, free of charge from anna.aero}}</ref>

Novosibirsk was founded on the right side of the [[Ob (river)|Ob]], near an area traditionally inhabited by [[Chat Tatars]] ({{ill|Chertovo gorodishche|ru|Чёртово городище (Новосибирск)}}).

The bridge, completed in the spring of 1897, made the new settlement a regional transport hub. The importance of the city further increased with the completion of the [[Turkestan–Siberia Railway]] in the early 20th century. The new railway connected Novonikolayevsk directly with [[Central Asia]] and the [[Caspian Sea]].<ref name="all">{{Cite web|url= http://www.allsiberia.com/novosibirsk/|title=Novosibirsk City Guide|website=Allsiberia.com|access-date=15 December 2021}}</ref>

At the time of the bridge's opening, Novonikolayevsk had a population of 7,800&nbsp;people. The settlement developed rapidly. Its first bank opened in 1906, and a total of five banks were operating by 1915. In 1907, Novonikolayevsk, now with a population exceeding 47,000, was granted town status with full rights for self-government. During the [[October Revolution|pre-revolutionary]] period, the population of Novonikolayevsk reached 80,000. The city had steady and rapid [[economic growth]], becoming one of the largest commercial and industrial centers of [[Siberia]]. It developed a significant agricultural-processing industry,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Сельское хозяйство :: Бизнес-журнал, новости Новосибирска и Новосибирской области |url= http://biz.newsib.ru/news/theme/52/ |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130224041400/http://biz.newsib.ru/news/theme/52/ |archive-date= 24 February 2013 |access-date=12 March 2013 |publisher= Biz.newsib.ru |df= mdy-all}}</ref> as well as a [[power station]], iron foundry, commodity market, several banks, and commercial and shipping companies. By 1917, the city had seven Orthodox churches and one [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Church, along with several cinemas, forty [[Primary education|primary schools]], a high school, a teaching seminary, and the Romanov House non-classical [[secondary school]]. In 1913, Novonikolayevsk became one of the first places in Russia to institute compulsory primary education.<ref name=all/>

The [[Russian Civil War]] of 1917–1923 took a toll on the city. Wartime epidemics, especially [[typhus]] and [[cholera]], claimed thousands of lives. In the course of the war, the Ob River Bridge was destroyed. For the first time in the city's history, the population of Novonikolayevsk began to decline. The Soviet Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies of Novonikolayevsk took control of the city in December 1917. In May 1918, the [[Czechoslovak Legion]] rose in opposition to the revolutionary government and, together with the [[White movement|White Guards]], captured Novonikolayevsk (26 May 1918). The [[Red Army]] took the city in 1919, retaining it throughout the rest of the Civil War.<ref name=all />

Novonikolayevsk began reconstruction in 1921 at the start of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]] period (1921–1928). The city formed part of [[Tomsk Governorate]] and served as its administrative center from 23 December 1919 to 14 March 1920. Between 13 June 1921 and 25  May 1925, it served as the administrative center of [[Novonikolayevsk Governorate]], which was separated from Tomsk Governorate.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Исторический обзор: "Новониколаевская губерния – Новосибирская область: люди, события, факты" {{!}} Библиотека сибирского краеведения |url=http://bsk.nios.ru/content/istoricheskiy-obzor-novonikolaevskaya-guberniya-novosibirskaya-oblast-lyudi-sobytiya-fakty |access-date=2024-01-31 |website=bsk.nios.ru}}</ref> The city received its present name on 12 September 1926,<ref name="Names" /> -''Novosibirsk'', which, in the Russian language, translates roughly as "New Siberian [town]".

After the Soviet Union abolished [[Governorate (Russia)|governorate]]s in 1929, the city served as the administrative center of the [[Siberian Krai]] until 23 July 1930, and of [[West Siberian Krai]] until 28 September 1937, when that krai was split into [[Novosibirsk Oblast]] and [[Altai Krai]].<ref name="base.consultant.ru">{{Cite web|url= http://base.consultant.ru/cons/cgi/online.cgi?req=doc;base=ESU;n=19030|title=Decision of Central Execution Committee of USSR dated 28 of September of 1937 (link to law base provided by official legal service "Consultant Plus")|website= Base.consultant.ru|access-date=15 December 2021}}</ref> Since then, it has served as the administrative center of Novosibirsk Oblast.<ref name="base.consultant.ru" />

The [[Monument to the Heroes of the Revolution]], erected in the center of the city in 1922, became one of the chief historic sites (essentially every child had to visit the monument on school field-trips during the Soviet years). Neglect in the 1990s while other areas were redeveloped helped preserve it in the post-Soviet era.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

During Stalin's industrialization effort, Novosibirsk secured its place as one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Several massive industrial facilities developed, including the 'Sibkombain' plant, specializing in the production of heavy mining equipment. Additionally, a metal-processing plant, a food-processing plant, and other industrial enterprises and factories were built, as well as a new [[power station]]. The great [[Soviet famine of 1932–33]] resulted in more than 170,000 rural refugees seeking food and safety in Novosibirsk. They were settled in barracks at the outskirts of the city, giving rise to [[slum]]s.<ref name=all /> Reflecting international recognition of its rapid growth and industrialization, in the US media Novosibirsk was referred to as the "[[Chicago]] of Siberia".<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=May 4, 1942 |title=From Novosibirsk to Komsomolsk |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,777759,00.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101014171609/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,777759,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 October 2010 |magazine=TIME |access-date=6 May 2009}}</ref>

Tram rails were laid down in 1934, by which time the population had reached 287,000, making Novosibirsk the largest city in Siberia. The following year the original road bridge over the Ob River was replaced by the new [[Kommunalny Bridge, Novosibirsk|Kommunalny bridge]].<ref name=all />

Between 1941 and 1942, the Soviets crated up and relocated more than 50 substantial factories from western Russia to Novosibirsk in order to reduce the risk of their destruction through [[Great Patriotic War|war]], and at this time the city became a major supply base for the [[Red Army]]. During this period the city also received more than 140,000 refugees.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Haywood |first=A.

The rapid growth of the city prompted the construction during the 1950s of a [[Novosibirsk Hydroelectric Station|hydroelectric power station]] with a capacity of 400 [[megawatt]]s,<ref>{{Cite web |title= Novosibirsk, Siberia, Russia History & Info|url=http://www.utopiasprings.com/instnovo.htm |access-date=6 May 2009|publisher=Utopiasprings.com}}</ref> necessitating the creation of a giant water reservoir, now known as the [[Novosibirsk Reservoir|Ob Sea]]. As a direct result of the station's construction, vast areas of fertile land were flooded, as were relic pine woods in the area; additionally, the new open space created by the reservoir's surface caused average wind speeds to double, increasing the rate of [[erosion|soil erosion]].<ref name=all/>

In the 1950s, the Soviet Government directed the building of a center for scientific research in Novosibirsk, and in 1957 the multi-facility [[science|scientific]] [[research]] complex of [[Akademgorodok]] was constructed about {{convert|30|km|sp=us||abbr=on}} south of the city center. The Siberian Division of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] (formerly the [[Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union]]) has its headquarters in Akademgorodok, and the town hosts more than 35 research institutes and universities, among them [[Novosibirsk State University]], one of the top Russian schools in natural sciences and mathematics. Although it possesses a fully autonomous infrastructure, Akademgorodok is administered by Novosibirsk.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

==Ecology==
===Flora===
The best-known trees native to Novosibirsk are [[birch]], [[pine]], and [[aspen]]. Some [[sorbus aucuparia|mountain ash]], [[crataegus monogyna|hawthorn]], [[spruce]], and [[fir]] are present as well. European species of [[Malus domestica|apple]], [[fraxinus|ash]], [[elm]], [[tilia|linden]], and [[oak]] have been successfully introduced.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

==Geography==
[[File:Бугринский мост Новосибирск II.PNG|300px|thumb|[[Bugrinsky Bridge]] on the [[Ob River]]]]

===Urban layout===
The layout of the modern city is based on the planning of the post-revolution period. Before 1917, there was no traditional city center in Novo-nikolayevsk. The main buildings of the railway management and the nearby railway station as well as the most important cathedral and the complex of the city's government were spread throughout the city. This changed following the revolution, with Lenin House built in 1925 in what was traditionally the main avenue, Krasny Prospekt while the first Lenin monument was built in Barnaulskaya Street, closer to the railway station. And thus, until the late 1920s, Novosibirsk did not have a clearly defined city center. The 1930s brought many changes to the development of the city: Its former Bazarnaya Ploschad (Market Square) was chosen as the site for the construction of the Opera House which started in 1931. The Stalin Park of Culture and Rest was established some distance from the main avenue and the city's administrative buildings and park created a radial around the Bazarnaya Ploschad.<ref>''Leader Cults and Spatial Politics'', pg. 144</ref>

There are 3 road ([[Kommunalny Bridge, Novosibirsk|Kommunalny]], [[Dimitrovsky Bridge, Novosibirsk|Dimitrovsky]], [[Bugrinsky Bridge|Bugrinsky]]), 2 railway ([[Novosibirsk Rail Bridge|First]], [[Komsomolsky Railway Bridge|Komsomolsky]]), and 1 [[Novosibirsk Metro Bridge|metro]] bridges within the city limits. The dam of the [[Novosibirsk Hydroelectric Station]] located on the territory of the city is also used for road traffic.

===Location===
The city stands on the banks of the Ob River in the [[West Siberian Plain]]. The southern boundary of the city runs through the [[Novosibirsk reservoir]], which is formed by the dam of the [[Novosibirsk Hydroelectric Station]] and cuts through the [[Ob Plateau]].

The nearest major cities are [[Omsk]], [[Barnaul]], [[Kemerovo]], [[Tomsk]].

===Climate===
The climate in Novosibirsk is typical of Siberia, with dry winters and far-below-freezing winter temperatures. Among the reasons for these temperatures are the absence of a nearby ocean and the lack of tall mountains at the north of Novosibirsk that could have held back freezing Arctic winds.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} In fact, Novosibirsk is the second-farthest substantially populated city from the ocean, the first being [[Ürümqi]] in China.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

The climate is [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb''), with warm summers and bitterly cold winters.   Snow is frequent, falling on almost half of all winter days, but individual snowfalls are usually light. On average temperatures range in summer from {{convert|+15|C}} to {{convert|+26|C}} and in winter from {{convert|-20|C}} to {{convert|-12|C}}. However, winter temperatures can go as low as {{convert|-30|C}} to {{convert|-35|C}}, and summer temperatures can go as high as {{convert|+30|C}} to {{convert|+35|C}}. The difference between the highest- and lowest-recorded temperatures is {{convert|82|C-change|0|abbr=on}}.

Travellers coming from countries with mild climates may find Novosibirsk's winter extremely cold, but it is a lot less severe than further east in Siberia and the [[Russian Far East]], especially considering its latitude of [[55th parallel north|55°N]]. For example, Novosibirsk is less cold during winter nights than [[Spassk-Dalny]] at eleven degrees lower latitude. It also is less cold in winter than the largest far eastern city of [[Khabarovsk]] and during nights even the Pacific coastal town of [[Sovetskaya Gavan]], both at less than [[49th parallel north|49°N]], and slightly milder than the Chinese city of [[Harbin]], the capital of Manchuria and [[Heilongjiang]] province in China, at only 45°N. Sometimes bitter cold may hold for some days, but temperatures of {{convert|-40|C}} and lower do not occur every year. Its overall temperatures are very similar to that of [[Winnipeg]], [[Canada]] at about 50 degrees north.

[[File:Novosibirsk train station 1000px.jpg|thumb|Trains at Novosibirsk-Glavny railway station]]
Novosibirsk is a major stop on the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] and the north end of [[Turkestan–Siberia Railway]]. The main [[Train station|railway station]] of Novosibirsk is [[Novosibirsk railway station|Novosibirsk-Glavny station]] ("Glavny" means "Main") which is located in the centre of the right bank part of the city. There are also [[Novosibirsk-Zapadny railway station|Novosibirsk-Zapadny]] ("Zapadny" means "Western"), [[Novosibirsk-Vostochny railway station|Novosibirsk-Vostochny]] ("Vostochny" means "Eastern"), and [[Novosibirsk-Yuzhny railway station|Novosibirsk-Yuzhny]] ("Yuzhny" means "Southern") railway stations in Novosibirsk. All [[Inter-city rail|intercity trains]] passing through the aforementioned stations stop at these stations. In addition, there are halts where only [[Commuter rail|suburban trains]] stops, for example [[Inskaya railway station|Inskaya]], Seyatel, Razyezd Inya, and many others.

The many regular intercity trains connect Novosibirsk with Russian cities in [[Siberia]], the [[Russian Far East|Far East]], [[Ural (region)|Ural]], and [[European Russia]]. International trains connect the city with [[China]], [[Mongolia]], [[Belarus]], and countries in [[Central Asia]].

====Bus stations====
The old Novosibirsk [[Bus station|Bus Station]] located on [[Krasny Avenue]] in the right bank part of the city near [[Kommunalny Bridge, Novosibirsk|Kommunalny Bridge]] was opened in 1964 and eventually closed on 6 April 2020.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shershnev|first=Artem|date=25 March 2020|title=Автовокзал на Красном проспекте прекращает работу|language=ru|work=VN.ru|url=https://vn.ru/news-avtovokzal-na-krasnom-prospekte-prekrashchaet-rabotu/|access-date=2020-05-05}}</ref> There is a plan to build some new bus stations on the periphery of the city; the first of these new [[bus station]]s was built on Gusinobrodskoe Сhaussee and was opened on 18 December 2019.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kukhmar|first=Alina|date=18 December 2019|title=Новый автовокзал открыли на Гусинобродском шоссе в Новосибирске|language=ru|work=VN.ru|url=https://vn.ru/news-novyy-avtovokzal-otkryli-na-gusinobrodskom-shosse-v-novosibirske-/|access-date=2020-05-05}}</ref> Until the completion of remaining new bus stations, some [[bus stop]]s in the city are being used by [[intercity bus service]]s.

The many regular intercity/international bus routes connect Novosibirsk with most cities of the southern part of Western [[Siberia]] and major cities of [[Central Asia]].

====River passenger terminals====
The building of Novosibirsk river [[Passenger terminal (maritime)|passenger terminal]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Речной вокзал) on the [[Ob river]] was opened in 1974.<ref>{{cite book|last=Balandin|first=Sergey|date=1986|title=Новосибирск : История градостроительства 1945-1985 гг.|language=ru|trans-title=Novosibirsk : History of urban planning 1945-1985|publisher=Книжное издательство|location=Novosibirsk|url=http://tehne.com/library/balandin-s-n-novosibirsk-istoriya-gradostroitelstva-1945-1985-gg-novosibirsk-1986/|access-date=5 May 2020}}</ref> Later, the [[Rechnoy Vokzal (Novosibirsk Metro)|self-titled metro station]] was opened near the building of the terminal. On 7 March 2003, there was the strong fire in the building of the terminal.<ref>{{cite news|author=<!--Staff writer(s)/no by-line.-->|date=11 March 2003|title=Новосибирская область: Речной вокзал в областном центре сгорел из-за непотушенного окурка и восстановлению не подлежит|language=ru|work=[[REGNUM News Agency]]|url=https://regnum.ru/news/95190.html}}</ref> The part of the building was beyond repair and was demolished.

At present day{{when|date=November 2024}}, only two regular passenger lines are operational: Novosibirsk - Kudryash island - Yagodnaya - Cheremushki - Novaya Zarya - Bibikha - Sedova Zaimka and Novosibirsk - [[Berdsk]].<ref name="rechflot54.ru">{{cite web|title=Пассажирские перевозки/Регулярные рейсы|language=ru|website=rechflot54.ru|url=https://www.rechflot54.ru/rechnye-progulki|access-date=22 September 2021}}</ref> There are also cruises on the [[Ob river]] and the [[Novosibirsk Reservoir]] including to [[Tomsk]] and [[Barnaul]]. River ships use the [[Novosibirsk Shipping Canal]], equipped with a single triple-chamber shipping lock and located in Novosibirsk along its entire length, for the passage from the river to the reservoir and from the reservoir to the river.

Usually, the period of navigability is opened in late April or early May and is closed in late September or early October.

===City public transportation===
