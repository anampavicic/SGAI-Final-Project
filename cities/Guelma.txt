'''Guelma''' ({{langx|ar|قالمة}} ''Qālima''; {{langx|arq|ڨالمة}}; <small>Algerian pronunciation:</small> {{IPA|ar|<!--no stress in Algerian Arabic-->ɡelmæ|}}) is the capital of [[Guelma Province]] and [[Guelma District]], located in north-eastern [[Algeria]], about 65&nbsp;kilometers from the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast. Its location corresponds to that of ancient [[Calama (Numidia)|Calama]].

==History==
[[Image:GM Guelma Theatre romain01.jpg|thumb|left|The Roman theater of Guelma]]

===Antiquity===
{{Main|Calama (Numidia)}}
Though Guelma was settled from early prehistory, it was first established as a town under the [[Phoenicia]]ns, who called it ''Malaca'', probably a [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] word meaning "[[salt]]" (sharing a common etymology with ''[[Málaga]]'' in [[Spain]]). Later, the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] settled the area and renamed it ''[[Calama (Numidia)|Calama]]'', part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Numidia]]. Calama prospered during the rise of [[Christianity]]; [[Saint Possidius]] was bishop of Guelma during the 5th century.

Later, the [[Vandal]] invasion devastated the area. When the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] settled in the area, they built [[city wall]]s to protect the community from further invasions. It was located in the Byzantine [[Exarchate of Africa]]. However, after the successful [[Medieval Muslim Algeria|Islamic conquest]] of Algeria, the area was long abandoned as a formal settlement, even much later, during [[History of Ottoman Algeria|Ottoman rule]].

===French rule===

Guelma was re-established as a formal settlement during the [[French Algeria|French invasion and colonisation of Algeria]], after seven [[centuries]] of abandonment. The annexation of the area began with the advancing of the French Army going to [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] from [[Annaba]]. (France claimed that its occupation of Constantine wade north-eastern Algeria officially a part of France.) The Army discovered (and temporarily occupied) the ruins of Calama from 10–15 November 1836 under the command of general [[Bertrand Clausel]].

Guelma was established as a city in 1836 and developed by French settlers.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/248224/Guelma  "Guelma,"] ''Encyclopædia Britannica''; retrieved 2012-11-15.</ref>

Its [[communes in France|communal]] constitution dates from 17 June 1854. A modern city quickly developed around the Roman ruins, first inside the restored Byzantine city walls, later also outside the walls, which continued to function during these times. There was also development near the [[railroad]], which crossed the city from the west to the east. The Roman theater of Guelma was restored in 1905 under the rule of mayor M. Joly. The city had a high percentage of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] settlers during these times, supported by the French colonial policy.

During the [[Sétif massacre]] of 8 May 1945, numerous settlers were killed. Guelma's oldest religious building that is still used for worship is the El-Atik Mosque, or "The Great Mosque Of Guelma" , built in 1837. Guelma has also had a [[synagogue]], which served [[History of the Jews in Algeria|local Jews]], and a church on the ''place de [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustin]],'' which served Christian European settlers. Most of the French and many other European were Roman Catholic.

===Post-independence===
[[File:General view of Guelma.jpg|thumbnail|left|General view of Guelma]]
After the [[Algerian War|Independence]] of Algeria, both the European settlers and the indigenous Jews left, and the synagogue and the church were converted into mosques. The population of Guelma grew at a rapid pace.

==Geography==
[[File:GM Guelma Maouna02.jpg|thumb|Nearby snow-covered Mount Maouna]]
Guelma is situated at the heart of a major agricultural region, 290&nbsp;m above sea level and surrounded by mountains (Maouna, Dbegh, Houara). The region is very fertile because of the [[Seybouse River]] and a large dam that provides a vast irrigation scheme. It occupies a strategic geographic position as a crossroads in north-eastern Algeria, linking the coast of [[Wilaya of Annaba]], [[El Taref]] and [[Skikda]] to inland areas such as Wilaya of Constantine, Oum El Bouagui and Souk-Ahras.

===Climate===
Guelma has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csa''). In winter there is more rainfall than in summer. The average annual temperature in Guelma is {{convert|17.2|°C|1}}. About {{convert|557|mm|2|abbr=on}} of precipitation falls annually.
