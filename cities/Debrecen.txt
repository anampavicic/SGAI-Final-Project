A [[city with county rights]], it was the largest Hungarian city in the 18th century<ref>Dezső Danyi-Zoltán Dávid: Az első magyarországi népszámlálás (1784-1787)/The first census in Hungary (1784-1787), Hungarian Central Statistical Office, Budapest, 1960</ref> and it is one of the Hungarian people's most important cultural centres.<ref name="Papp">Antal Papp: Magyarország (Hungary), Panoráma, Budapest, 1982, {{ISBN|963 243 241 X}}, p. 860, pp. 463-477</ref> Debrecen was also the [[List of historical capitals of Hungary|capital city of Hungary]] during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|revolution in 1848–1849]]. During the revolution, the dethronement of the [[Habsburg dynasty]] was declared in the [[Reformed Great Church of Debrecen|Reformed Great Church]]. The city also served as the capital of Hungary by the end of World War II in 1944–1945.<ref name="Papp"/> It is home to the [[University of Debrecen]].

==Etymology==
There are at least three narratives of the origin of the city's name. The city is first documented in 1235, as ''Debrezun''. One theory states that the name derives from the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] word {{lang|trk|debresin}}, which means 'live' or 'move.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lilla-debrecen.sulinet.hu/debrecen.html|title=History of Debrecen (Hungarian)|access-date=8 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305121527/http://www.lilla-debrecen.sulinet.hu/debrecen.html|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Another theory says the name is of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] origin and means 'well-esteemed', from Slavic Dьbricinъ or from ''dobre zliem'' ("good land").{{cn|date=November 2023}} Thirdly and lastly, Professor [[Šimon Ondruš]] derived the [[Toponymy|toponym]] from Proto-Slavic term [[wiktionary:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/dьbrь|*dьbrь]] (gorge). <ref>Ondruš, Šimon. Odtajnené trezory 2. Martin: Matica Slovenská (2002). p.190 {{isbn|80-7090-659-6}}</ref>

The standard [[Romanian language|Romanian]] name for the city is {{lang|ro|Debrețin}}, however [[Romanians in Hungary|Romanian communities in Hungary]] use the version {{lang|ro|Dobrițân}}.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ou8WEAAAQBAJ|title=Boyash Studies: Researching "Our People"|editor-first1=Annemarie|editor-last1=Sorescu-Marinković|editor-first2=Thede|editor-last2=Kahl|editor-link2=Thede Kahl|editor-first3=Biljana|editor-last3=Sikimić|chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/45650852|chapter=The language of Boyash communities in Central and Eastern Hungary|first=Mátyás|last=Rosenberg|publisher=Frank & Timme Verlag|series=Forum: Rumänien|page=252|year=2021|isbn=9783732906949}}</ref>

== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of Debrecen}}
[[File:Debrecen Piac utca old.jpg|left|thumb|Piac Street in 1910s]]
[[File:Debrecen, Piac Street 18 and 20.jpg|left|thumb|Downtown]]
[[File:Debrecen-bocskai.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stephen Bocskay]] was a Hungarian noble from [[Transylvania]].]]
The settlement was established after the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|Hungarian conquest]].<ref name="Papp"/> Debrecen became more important after some of the small villages of the area (Boldogasszonyfalva, Szentlászlófalva) were deserted due to the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]]. It experienced rapid development after the middle of the 13th century.<ref name="Papp"/>

In 1361, [[Louis I of Hungary]] granted the citizens of Debrecen the right to choose the town's judge and council. This provided some opportunities for self-government for the town. By the early 16th century, Debrecen was an important market town.<ref name="Papp"/>

King [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor]], as part of a treaty with Serbian ruler [[Stefan Lazarević]], gave him the opportunity to rule Debrecen in September 1411.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}} A year after Lazarević's death in 1426, his role was taken over by his successor, [[Đurađ Branković]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Between 1450 and 1507, it was a domain of the [[Hunyadi family]].<ref name="Papp"/>

During the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period, being close to the border and having no castle or city walls, Debrecen often found itself in difficult situations and the town was saved only by the diplomatic skills of its leaders. Sometimes the town was protected by the [[Ottoman Empire]], sometimes by the Catholic European rulers or by [[Francis II Rákóczi]], prince of [[Transylvania]]. Debrecen later embraced the [[Protestant Reformation]] quite early, earning the monikers of "the Calvinist Rome" and "the [[Geneva]] of Hungary". At this period the inhabitants of the town were mainly Hungarian [[Calvinism|Calvinists]]. Debrecen came under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman control]] as a [[sanjak]] between 1558 and 1693 and orderly bounded to the [[eyalet]]s of Budin (1541–1596), [[Eger|Eğri]] (1596–1660) and [[Oradea|Varat]] (1660–1693) as "Debreçin".

In 1693, [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]] elevated Debrecen to [[free royal town]] status. In 1715, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] returned to Debrecen, and the town gave it a place to build a church, allowing the Piarist monks to build the St. Ann's Cathedral. By this time the town was an important cultural, commercial and agricultural centre, and many future scholars and poets attended its Protestant College (a predecessor of today's [[University of Debrecen]] and also of [[Debrecen Reformed Theological University]]).

In 1849, Debrecen was the capital of Hungary for a short time when the Hungarian revolutionary government fled there from Pest-Buda (modern-day Budapest).<ref name="Papp"/> In April 1849, the dethronization of Habsburgs (neglected after the fall of the revolution) and the independence of Hungary was proclaimed here by [[Lajos Kossuth]] at the Great (Calvinist) Church (''Nagytemplom'' in Hungarian.) The last battle of the war of independence was also close to Debrecen. The Russians, allied to Habsburgs, defeated the Hungarian army close to the western part of the town.

After the war, Debrecen slowly began to prosper again. In 1857, the railway line between Budapest and Debrecen was completed, and Debrecen soon became a railway junction. New schools, hospitals, churches, factories, and mills were built, banks and insurance companies settled in the city. The appearance of the city began to change too: with new, taller buildings, parks and villas, it no longer resembled a provincial town and began to look like a modern city. In 1884, Debrecen became the first Hungarian city to have a steam tramway.

After [[World War I]], Hungary lost a considerable portion of its eastern territory to [[Romania]], and Debrecen once again became situated close to the border of the country. It was occupied by the Romanian army for a short time in 1919. Tourism provided a way for the city to begin to prosper again. Many buildings (among them an indoor swimming pool and Hungary's first stadium) were built in the central park, the ''Nagyerdő'' ("Big Forest"), providing recreational facilities. The building of the university was completed. Hortobágy, a large pasture owned by the city, became a tourist attraction.

During World War II, Debrecen was almost completely destroyed, 70% of the buildings suffered damage, 50% of them were completely destroyed. A major battle involving combined arms, including several hundred tanks ([[Battle of Debrecen]]), occurred near the city in October 1944. Debrecen was captured by [[Red Army|Soviet]] troops of the [[Steppe Front|2nd Ukrainian Front]] on 20 October. After 1944, the reconstruction began and Debrecen became the capital of Hungary for a short time once again.<ref name="Papp"/> The citizens began to rebuild their city, trying to restore its pre-war status, but the new, Communist government of Hungary had other plans. The institutions and estates of the city were taken into public ownership, private property was taken away. This forced change of the old system brought new losses to Debrecen; half of its area was annexed to nearby towns, and the city also lost its rights over Hortobágy. In 1952, two new villages – [[Ebes]] and [[Nagyhegyes]] – were formed from former parts of Debrecen, while in 1981, the nearby village [[Debrecen-Józsa|Józsa]] was annexed to the city.

====Reformed Church in Debrecen====

[[File:Ref. Nagytemplom (5233. számú műemlék) 11.jpg|thumb|left|[[Protestant Great Church of Debrecen|The Great Church]]]]

From the 16th century, the Reformation took roots in the city; first Lutheranism, then [[John Calvin|Calvin]]'s teachings become predominant. From 1551, the Calvinist government of the city forbade Catholics from moving to Debrecen. Catholic churches were taken over by the Calvinist church. The Catholic faith vanished from the city until 1715 when it regained a church. Several Calvinist church leaders like Peter Melius Juhasz who translated the Genevan Psalms lived and worked here. In 1567, a synod was formed in the city when the [[Second Helvetic Confession]] was adopted. Famous Calvinist colleges and schools were formed. Nickname of Debrecen commonly used in Hungary is the ''Calvinist Rome'' or the ''Geneva of Hungary'' because of the great percentage of the Calvinist faith in the city as well as the Calvinist church has significant influence in the city and the region. Debrecen is also home to the Reformed Theological University of Debrecen (Debreceni Református Hittudományi Egyetem),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://drhe.hu/|title=DRHE|accessdate=18 December 2022}}</ref> founded in 1538 and was the only Calvinist theological institute in the country permitted to function during the communist rule.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://drhe.hu/egyetemunk/|title=Egyetemünk – DRHE|accessdate=18 December 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ttre.hu/egyhazkerulet/a-kerulet-tortenete|title=A kerület története - Egyházkerület - Tiszántúli Református Egyházkerület|access-date=25 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903124411/http://ttre.hu/egyhazkerulet/a-kerulet-tortenete|archive-date=3 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://regi.reformatus.hu/mutat/6823/|title=Reformatus.hu &#124; History of the RCH|website=regi.reformatus.hu|accessdate=18 December 2022}}</ref>

The Hungarian Reformed Church has about 20 congregations in Debrecen, including the famous [[Reformed Great Church of Debrecen]], which can easily accommodate about 5000 people (with 3000 seats).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://derefem.hu/|title=Debreceni Református Egyházmegye|website=Debreceni Református Egyházmegye|accessdate=18 December 2022}}</ref>

====Jewish community====
[[File:Debrecen-Synagogue.jpg|thumb|The main synagogue in the center of the city]]

Jews were first allowed to settle in Debrecen in 1814, with an initial population count of 118 men within 4 years.
Twenty years later, they were allowed to purchase land and homes. By 1919, they consisted 10% of the population (with over 10,000 community members listed) and owned almost half of the large properties in and around the town.<ref name="KB">Debrecen Kehilla book, pp. 12-14</ref>

The Hungarian antisemitic laws of 1938 caused many businesses to close, and in 1939 many Jews were enslaved and sent to Ukraine, where many died in minefields.<ref name="KB"/>

In 1940, the Germans estimated that 12,000 Jews were left in the town. In 1941, Jews of Galician and Polish origin were expelled, reducing the number of Jews to 9142. In 1942, more Jews were drafted into the Hungarian forced labor groups and sent to Ukraine.

German forces entered the city on 20 March 1944, (Two and a half weeks before Passover) ordering a [[Jewish councils in Hungary|Judenrat]] (Jewish Council) headed by Rabbi Pal (Meir) Weisz, and a Jewish police squad was formed, headed by former army captain Bela Lusztbaum. On 30 March 1944, (a week before Passover) the Jews were ordered to wear the Yellow star of David. Jewish cars were confiscated and phone lines cut. During the Passover week, many Jewish dignitaries were taken to a nearby prison camp, eventually reaching the number of 300 prisoners. A week later all Jewish stores were closed, and a public book-burning of Jewish books was presided over by the antisemitic newspaper editor Mihaly Kalosvari Borska.  {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

An order to erect a ghetto was issued on 28 April 1944, in the name of the town mayor Sandor Kolscey, who opposed the act, and was ousted by the Germans. Jews were forced to build the Ghetto walls, finishing it within less than a month on 15 May 1944.

On 7 June 1944, all movement in or out of the Ghetto was prohibited and a week later all Debrecen Jews were deported to the nearby Serly brickyards, and stripped of their belongings, joining Jews from other areas.<ref name="EJ">[https://books.google.com/books?id=MFn3KeENnA0C&pg=PA481 The Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust] On the Hajdúböszörmény jail camp</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aish.com/judah-samet-dodging-bullets-again/|title=Judah Samet: Dodging Bullets Again|date=28 April 2019|accessdate=18 December 2022}}</ref>

Ten families of prominent Jews, including those of Rabbi Weisz and orthodox chief Rabbi Strasser, along with the heads of the Zionist (non orthodox) movement joined the [[Kasztner train]]. (According to some sources, the Strasshoff camps were filled with Jews for negotiations in case the Germans could receive something for releasing these Jews, among them 6841 from Debrecen.) 298 of these Debrecen Jews were shot by the SS in Bavaria, after being told they would reach [[Theresienstadt]].  Some young Debrecen Jews escaped the town, led by the high school principal Adoniyahu Billitzer and reached Budapest, joining resistance movements and partisans.<ref name="EJ"/>

Most of the remaining Debrecen Jews were deported to Auschwitz, reaching there on 3 July 1944.
Debrecen was occupied by the Soviet Army on 20 October 1944. Some 4,000 Jews of Debrecen and its surroundings survived the war, creating a community of 4,640 in 1946 – the largest in the region. About 400 of those moved to Israel, and many others moved to the west by 1970, with 1,200 Jews left in the town, using two synagogues, one of them established before World War I.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eugene KATZ |url=http://www.kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/Debrecen/ |title=KehilaLinks on Debrecen |publisher=kehilalinks.jewishgen.org |access-date=27 April 2018}}</ref>

[[File:Kossuth Lajos Tudományegyetem épülete (5228. számú műemlék).jpg|left|thumb|The main building of the [[University of Debrecen]]]]
Mainly thanks to the Reformation and the prestigious Reformed College of Debrecen, founded in 1538, Debrecen has been the intellectual and cultural centre of the surrounding area since the 16th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eu-medstudy.com/university-of-debrecen-medical-school/ |title=University of Debrecen Medical School |publisher=eu-medstudy.com |access-date=28 February 2018 |archive-date=21 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190221174412/https://www.eu-medstudy.com/university-of-debrecen-medical-school |url-status=dead }}</ref> The College formed into a full-scale university in 1912, and its intellectual life developed a sphere of influence between [[Eger]] and [[Oradea]] (Hu: ''Nagyvárad'', now in Romania). In 1949–1950, several departments of the university were shut down, due to Communist takeover, with many students and teachers being expelled. During the decades of the socialist regime, Debrecen had three separate universities: the Kossuth Lajos University of Sciences (KLTE) was the bearer of the College's traditions with its arts and natural science faculties; the Medical University of Debrecen (DOTE) was the main medical school of Eastern Hungary; and the Debrecen University of Agriculture (DATE) was one of the two major agricultural universities of the country besides Gödöllő. The three entities formed the current [[University of Debrecen]] in 2000, with several new faculties being formed since the 1990s from the Faculty of Law to the newest addition of the Faculty of Informatics. Its main building, which now almost unanimously belongs to the Faculty of Arts, is still widely recognized work of architecture (mostly thanks to its main building). The university is the largest university in Hungary, has more than 100 departments and is a major research facility in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unideb.hu/portal/en/node/19 |title=History of the University &#124; Debreceni Egyetem |publisher=Unideb.hu |date=1 January 2000 |access-date=25 December 2012 |archive-date=4 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304191117/https://www3.unideb.hu/portal/en/node/19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The university is well known for the cactus research laboratory in the botanic gardens behind the main building.

In the second half of the 19th century, the Debrecen press attracted several notable figures to the city. [[Endre Ady]], [[Gyula Krúdy]], and [[Árpád Tóth]] all began their journalistic careers in Debrecen. Prominent literary figures from the city have included [[Magda Szabó]], and {{Interlanguage link multi|Gábor Oláh|hu|3=Oláh Gábor (költő)}}. One of Hungary's best known poets, [[Mihály Csokonai Vitéz]], was born and lived in the city. The city's theatre, built in 1865, was named in his honour in 1916, but can trace its roots back to the National Theatre Company founded in Debrecen in 1789, which at first gave performances in the carthouse of an inn. Celebrated actress [[Blaha Lujza|Lujza Blaha]] is among those to have performed there.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://csokonaiszinhaz.hu/|title=Csokonai Színház|website=Csokonai Színház|accessdate=18 December 2022}}</ref>

Debrecen is home to [[Tankcsapda]], one of Hungary's most successful rock bands.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} There is also a rock school in the city which offers training and mentoring to young musicians. Classic media in the city include the newspaper Napló, two TV channels, a range of local radio stations and several companies and associations producing media material.

Debrecen is located on the [[Great Alföld|Great Hungarian Plain]], {{convert|220|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} east of Budapest. Situated nearby is the [[Hortobágy National Park]].

==Transport==
The city used to be somewhat isolated from Budapest, Hungary's main transport hub. However, the completion of the [[M35 motorway (Hungary)|M35]] motorway means Budapest can now be reached in under two hours. [[Debrecen International Airport|Debrecen Airport]] (the second largest in Hungary) has recently undergone modernisation in order to be able to handle more international flights, although almost all flights to and from Hungary still use Budapest's [[Budapest Ferihegy International Airport|Ferihegy Airport]] (now called Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport). Cities that can be reached from the Debrecen Airport include [[Brussels]], [[Eindhoven]], [[London]], [[Malmö]], [[Milan]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Moscow]] and [[Paris]]. There have also been improvements to some parts of the railway between the capital and Debrecen as part of Hungary's mainly [[European Union|EU]]-funded National Development Plan for 2004 to 2006. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
