'''Cavite City''', officially the '''City of Cavite''' ({{lang-cbk|Ciudad de Cavite}} and {{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Kabite}}) is a 2nd class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] in the [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 100,674 people.{{PH census|current}}

The city was the capital of [[Cavite|Cavite Province]] from its establishment in 1614 until the title was transferred to the newly created, more accessible city of [[Trece Martires]] in 1954. Cavite City was originally a small port town, Cavite Puerto, that prospered during the early [[History of the Philippines (1521-1898)|Spanish colonial period]], when it served as the main seaport of Manila. Cavite Puerto hosted the [[Manila Galleon|Manila-Acapulco galleon trade]], along with other large sea-bound ships. Thereafter, San Roque and La Caridad, two formerly independent towns in Cavite province,<ref>Bureau of Insular Affairs (1902). [https://archive.org/details/apronouncinggaz00keimgoog/page/n531 <!-- pg=450 quote=Cavite. --> ""], pg. 450. Government Printing Office, Washington.</ref> were annexed by the city. Today, Cavite City includes the communities of San Antonio (Cañacao and Sangley Point),<ref name=about>De la Rosa, Joy (2007–09). [http://cavitecitylibrary.home.ph.istemp.com/custom3.html "About Cavite City"]. Cavite City Library and Museum. Retrieved on October 19, 2014.</ref> the southern districts of Santa Cruz and Dalahican, and the outlying islands of the province, such as the historic [[Corregidor Island]].

==Etymology==
The city has been known by at least two [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] names. The first, ''Tangway'', was the name given to the area by [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] settlers. ''Tangway'' means "peninsula." The second is ''Kawit'' or "hook," referring to the hook-shaped landform along the coast of [[Bacoor Bay]],<ref name=about/> and from which the [[Sinicization|Chinese]] ''Keit'' and [[Castilianization|Spanish]] ''Cavite'' are derived.<ref name=keit/>

==History==
===Early history===
The early inhabitants of Cavite City were the Tagalogs ruled by the Kampilan and the bullhorn of a datu, the tribal form of government.{{cn|date=June 2024}}  According to folklore, the earliest settlers came from [[Borneo]], led by Gat Hinigiw and his wife Dayang Kaliwanag, who bore seven children.{{cn|date=June 2024}} Archaeological evidence in the coastal areas shows prehistoric settlements.{{cn|date=June 2024}}

===Spanish colonial era===

[[File:Cavite City - Governor's Palace 1899.jpg|thumb|left|The Governor's Palace in the Navy Yard at the old Port City of Cavite (1899).]]
On May 16, 1571, the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] declared the region a royal ''encomienda'', or royal [[land grant]].{{cn|date=June 2024}}  Spanish colonizers settled in the most populated area (present-day [[Kawit]]) and called it [[Cavite]]. The old ''Tangway'' at the tip of the [[Cavite Peninsula]], across Bacoor Bay, was referred to as ''Cavite la Punta'', meaning "Point of Cavite" or Cavite Point. Upon discovering that, because of its deep waters, Cavite la Punta was a suitable place for the repair and construction of Spanish [[galleon|galleons]], the Spanish moved their settlement there and called it ''Cavite Nuevo'' (New Cavite) or just ''Cavite''. The first settlement was renamed "Cavite Viejo" (and in the early 20th century, regained its former name, Kawit). In 1582, the Spanish founded Cavite City with 65 Spanish households.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.530346/2015.530346.jesuits-in_djvu.txt "Jesuits In The Philippines (1581-1768)" Page 59] "These settlements were much smaller than Manila. In 1582 Manila had
an adult male population of 300 Spaniards; Vigan, 60; Nueva Caceres, 
30; Cebu, 70; Arevalo, 20. In 1586 Manila had 329 Spanish men and 
youths capable of bearing arms; the most recently established settlement, Nueva Segovia in Cagayan, had 97; Nueva Caceres, 69; Arevalo, 65; Cavite, 64; Cebu, 63; Villa Fernandina, 19."</ref>

In 1590, the Spaniards fortified Cavite Nuevo/Cavite City with ''murallas'' (high thick [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain walls)]] on its western, northern, and eastern sides, while Bacoor Bay remained open to the south. Fort Guadalupe was built at the same time on the eastern tip, and the town became the ''Puerto de Cavite'' (Port of Cavite) or ''Cavite Puerto''. The Fort of San Felipe Neri and the Porta Vaga Gate began construction in 1595 and were completed in 1602. Puerta Vaga (corrupted to Porta Vaga) was the port city's [[barbican]], the only principal entrance from San Roque in the west. It was flanked by the western wall, protected by two bastions at its northern and southern ends. The wall and gate were also separated from the mainland by a moat, which made the town like an island.<ref name=muog1/>

Cavite was legally founded in 1614 with Tomás Salazar as the earliest known ''gobernadorcillo'' recorded.<ref name=muog1/>  At the same time, the town became the capital of the new politico-military province of Cavite, established also in 1614.<ref>Census Office of the Philippine Islands (1920).

Bureau of Printing, Manila.</ref>  Like some other [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] during the Spanish era, the province adopted the name of its capital town – e.g., [[Bulacan, Bulacan]] province; [[Tayabas]], Tayabas (today, [[Quezon province]]); [[Tarlac, Tarlac]] province; and [[Manila]], [[Manila province]].

San Roque was founded as a separate town in 1614. In 1663, during the Spanish evacuation of [[Ternate, Indonesia]], the 200 families of mixed Mexican-Filipino-Spanish and Papuan-Indonesian-Portuguese descent who had ruled over the Christianized [[Sultanate of Ternate]], including their Christian-convert Sultan,<ref>{{cite book |author= Peter Borschberg |year= 2015 | title = ''Journal, Memorials and Letters of Cornelis Matelieff de Jonge.

In subsequent years, Latin-American soldiers from [[Mexican settlement in the Philippines|Mexico were deployed at Cavite]]: 70 soldiers in 1636; 89 in 1654; 225 in 1670; and 211 in 1672.<ref name="Mexicans">https://academic.oup.com/past/article/232/1/87/1752419 Convicts or Conquistadores?

San Roque was later placed under the civil administration of Cavite until it was granted the right to be a separate and independent municipality in 1720. La Caridad, formerly known as La Estanzuela of San Roque, separated and was legally founded as a town in 1868. The Spanish Governor General Jose de la Gardana granted the petition of the people led by Don Justo Miranda to make Barrio La Estanzuela an independent town.

====City of Churches====
As the town grew, it developed a cosmopolitan reputation, and attracted various [[religious order]]s to set up churches, convents, and hospitals within the confines of the fortified city center. The [[Franciscan]] ''Hospital de San Jose'' (Saint Joseph Hospital) was built for sailors and soldiers in 1591. The San Diego de Alcala Convent was built in 1608, followed by the Convents of Porta Vaga (La Ermita), Our Lady of Loreto ([[Jesuit]]), San Juan de Dios ([[Order of St John of God|St. John of God]]), Santo Domingo ([[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]), Santa Monica ([[Recollects]]), and San Pedro, the port's parish church. The fortified town enclosed eight churches, the Jesuit college of San Ildefonso, public buildings and residences, all meant to serve the needs of its population of natives, soldiers and workers at the port, transients, and passengers aboard galleons.<ref name=muog1>Muog (January 28, 2008).

During this period, the city was called "Tierra de Maria Santisima" (Land of Most Holy Mary) because of the popularity of the [[Marian devotion]].{{cn|date=June 2024}}  Plazas and parks abounded: Plaza de Armas (across from San Felipe Fort), Plaza de San Pedro (across from the church), Plaza Soledad (across from Porta Vaga), and Plaza del Reparo (bayside).

====Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade====
[[File:Cavite City skyline 1899.jpg|thumb|left|The skyline of the old Port City of Cavite in 1899.]]
The Port of Cavite ''(Puerto de Cavite)'' was linked to the history of world trade. Spanish galleons passed back and forth every July between [[Acapulco]] (Mexico) and Cavite. Galleons and other heavy ocean-going ships were not able to enter the Port of Manila along the [[Pasig River]] because of a sand bar that only allows light vessels to reach the river-port. For this reason, the Port of Cavite was regarded as the Port of Manila,<ref>Brewster, Sir David (1832). [https://books.google.com/books?id=OBAbAQAAMAAJ&dq=port+of+cavite&pg=PA529 "The Edinburgh Encyclopædia, Vol. 15 – Philippine Islands"]. Joseph and Edward Parker, Philadelphia – Google Books.</ref> the main seaport of the capital city.<ref name=galleon/>

At the height of the [[Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade]], the Port of Cavite was the arrival and departure port of the [[Spanish galleon]]s that brought many foreign travelers (mostly Spaniards and Latinos) to its shores.<ref>Galaup "Travel Accounts" page 375.</ref><ref>"Forced Migration in the Spanish Pacific World" By Eva Maria Mehl, page 235.</ref> The Port of Cavite was fondly called ''Ciudad de Oro Macizo'' meaning the "City of Solid Gold". The Chinese emperor once sent some of his men to the place they called ''Keit'' (Cavite) to search for gold.<ref name=keit>Blair and Robertson (1904). [https://books.google.com/books?id=4c7TAAAAMAAJ&q=keit&pg=PA104 "Philippine Islands 1493–1803, Vol. 12, 1601–1604"]. pg. 104. Arthu H. Clark Co., Cleveland, OH.</ref> Marilola Perez, in her 2015 Thesis "Cavite Chabacano Philippine Creole Spanish: Description and Typology", describes a large number of Mexicans settling in Cavite and spreading to Luzon, integrating into the local population and leading peasant revolts.<ref>(Page 10) {{cite thesis |type=PhD|last=Pérez|first=Marilola |date=2015|title=Cavite Chabacano Philippine Creole Spanish: Description and Typology|quote= "The galleon activities also attracted a great number of Mexican men that arrived from the Mexican Pacific coast as ships’ crewmembers (Grant 2009: 230). Mexicans were administrators, priests and soldiers (guachinangos or hombres de pueblo) (Bernal 1964: 188) many though, integrated into the peasant society, even becoming tulisanes ‘bandits’ who in the late 18th century “infested” Cavite and led peasant revolts (Medina 2002: 66). Meanwhile, in the Spanish garrisons, Spanish was used among administrators and priests. Nonetheless, there is not enough historical information on the social role of these men. In fact some of the few references point to a quick integration into the local society: “los hombres del pueblo, los soldados y marinos, anónimos, olvidados, absorbidos en su totalidad por la población Filipina.” (Bernal 1964: 188). In addition to the Manila-Acapulco galleon, a complex commercial maritime system circulated European and Asian commodities including slaves. During the 17th century, Portuguese vessels traded with the ports of Manila and Cavite, even after the prohibition of 1644 (Seijas 2008: 21). Crucially, the commercial activities included the smuggling and trade of slaves: “from the Moluccas, and Malacca, and India… with the monsoon winds” carrying “clove spice, cinnamon, and pepper and black slaves, and Kafir [slaves]” (Antonio de Morga cf Seijas 2008: 21).” Though there is no data on the numbers of slaves in Cavite, the numbers in Manila suggest a significant fraction of the population had been brought in as slaves by the Portuguese vessels. By 1621, slaves in Manila numbered 1,970 out of a population of 6,110. This influx of slaves continued until late in the 17th century; according to contemporary cargo records in 1690, 200 slaves departed from Malacca to Manila (Seijas 2008: 21). Different ethnicities were favored for different labor; Africans were brought to work on the agricultural production, and skilled slaves from India served as caulkers and carpenters.

Between 1609 and 1616 the [[galleon]]s ''Espiritu Santo'' and ''San Miguel'' were constructed in the shipyard of the port, called the ''Astillero de Rivera'' (Rivera Shipyard of Cavite), sometimes spelled as ''Ribera''.<ref name=galleon>Fish, Shirley (2011).

====San Roque Isthmus====
[[File:Cavite City - San Roque Causeway in 1899.jpg|thumb|The San Roque causeway connecting Cavite Nuevo to San Roque town (1899)]]
The narrow San Roque [[isthmus]] or [[causeway]] (now M. Valentino Street) connected Cavite Puerto to San Roque, its only border town. Maps from the 17th century show that this narrow isthmus was once as wide as the town itself.<ref>[http://www.aenet.org/manila-expo/page24.htm "Philippines is Not Only Manila"]. Discovering Philippines. Retrieved on October 30, 2014.</ref>  Problems with rising water and the encroaching waves that plagued Cavite Puerto likely eroded the land into a narrow isthmus.<ref name=muog2>[http://muog.wordpress.com/2008/01/28/fueza-de-san-felipe-neri-%E2%80%A2-cavite-naval-station-cavite-city/ ""].

===American Invasion Era===
[[File:Cavite 1941-10-27.jpg|thumb|The U.S naval base in 1941 before its destruction in 1945.]]
Spain turned the port over to the Americans after the [[Treaty of Paris of 1898]]. At the start of the American era, Cavite Puerto became the seat of the U.S. Naval Forces in the Philippines. It was redesigned to make way for modern ships and armaments. The historical structures, like Fort Guadalupe, were demolished, along with most of Fort San Felipe.<ref name=muog1/>

Local government administration was reorganized under the ''Presidentes municipales'' with the direct supervision of American army officers (the first being Colonel Meade). The first Filipino ''Presidentes municipales'' were appointed: Don Zacaria Fortich for Cavite Puerto, Don Francisco Basa for San Roque, and Don Pedro Raqueño Bautista for Caridad.

In 1900, the Caviteños held their first election under the American regime. Each pueblo or town elected local officials'': Presidente municipal'', ''Vice-Presidente municipal'' and a ''Consejo'' (council) composed of ''Consejales'' (councilors). Don Gregorio Basa was elected as the ''Presidente Municipal'' of present-day Cavite City.

In 1901, the Philippine Commission approved a municipal code as the organic law of all local governments throughout the country. In its implementation in 1903, the three separate pueblos of Cavite Puerto, San Roque, and La Caridad were merged into one [[municipality]], which was called the Municipality of Cavite. By virtue of a legislative act promulgated by the [[First Philippine Assembly]], Cavite was again made the capital of the province. Subsequently, its territory was enlarged to include the district of San Antonio and the island of [[Corregidor]]. The Municipality of Cavite functioned as a civil government whose officials consisted of a Presidente Municipal, a Vice-Presidente Municipal and ten Consejales duly elected by the qualified voters of the [[Municipalities of the Philippines|municipality]].

In 1909, Executive Order No. 124, of Governor-General [[W. Cameron Forbes]], declared the Act No. 1748 annexing [[Corregidor]] and the islands of Caballo (Fort Hughes), La Monja, El Fraile (Fort Drum), Santa Amalia, Carabao (Fort Frank) and Limbones, as well as all waters and detached rocks surrounding them, to the Municipality of Cavite.

====Cityhood====
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
Under the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippine Commonwealth]], Assemblyman Manuel S. Roxas sponsored Commonwealth Act No. 547, elevating Cavite's status to a chartered city. On September 7, 1940, the executive function of the city was vested in a City Mayor appointed by the President of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippine Commonwealth]]. The legislative body of the City of Cavite was vested on a Municipal Board composed of three electives, two appointives, and two ex-officio [[councilors]], with the City Mayor as the presiding officer.

===Japanese Occupation Era===
[[File:Belfry of the Church of Santa Monica.jpg|thumb|left|The Spanish era belfry ruins of a former Augustinian Recollects, Church of Santa Monica build on 1616 after the city was heavily bombarded during [[World War II]] in 1945.]]
On December 10, 1941, two days after an attack that had destroyed American air defenses at [[Clark Field]] and three days after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]], Japanese Imperial Forces destroyed Cavite Naval Base and bombed Cavite City.

Later, after Japan seized the Philippines, Japanese leaders appointed at least two City Mayors of Cavite City.

The island of [[Corregidor]] played an important role during the [[Japanese invasion of the Philippines]]. The island was the site of two costly [[siege]]s and pitched battles—the first in early 1942, and the second in January, 1945—between the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and the [[U.S. Army]], along with its smaller subsidiary force, the [[Philippine Army]].

In 1945, during the fight to liberate the country from Japan, the US and Philippine Commonwealth militaries bombarded the Japanese forces stationed in the city, completely destroying the old historic port of Cavite. The old walls and the Porta Vaga Gate were damaged. Most of the structures were destroyed, but some of the church towers remained. The city was littered with bomb craters.<ref name=bomb>Tewell, John (January 29, 2011). [https://www.flickr.com/photos/johntewell/5396941653/in/set-72157625790065191/ "Cavite, Luzon Island, Philippines 1945"]. Flickr. Retrieved on 2014-10-20.</ref>

After the war, the city's local administration resumed operations. The walls, gates, and ruins of the old city were later removed. Only the bell tower of the Church of Santa Monica of the Augustinian Recollects and the two [[bastion]]s of Fort San Felipe remain from the old city.

===Transfer of Provincial Capital===
Republic Act No. 981, passed by the [[Congress of the Philippines]] in 1954, transferred the capital of the province from Cavite City to the newly established [[Trece Martires]]. Subsequently, the city charter was amended. By virtue of an amendment to the charter of Cavite City, the City Mayor, City Vice Mayor and eight councilors were elected by popular vote. The first election of city officials in this way was held in 1963.

===During the Marcos Dictatorship===
{{main|Marcos dictatorship}}
The Philippines' gradual postwar recovery took a turn for the worse in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the [[1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis]] being an early landmark event.<ref name=Balbosas1992>{{Cite journal |last=Balbosa |first=Joven Zamoras |date=1992 |title=IMF Stabilization Program and Economic Growth: The Case of the Philippines |journal=Journal of Philippine Development |volume=XIX |issue=35 |url=https://dirp4.pids.gov.ph/ris/pjd/pidsjpd92-2imf.pdf |access-date=May 4, 2023 |archive-date=September 21, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210921141056/https://dirp4.pids.gov.ph/ris/pjd/pidsjpd92-2imf.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> Economic analysts generally attribute the crisis to the ramp-up on loan-funded government spending to promote [[Ferdinand Marcos’ 1969 reelection campaign]].<ref name=Balbosas1992/><ref name="Balisacan&Hill2003">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O_L9k58WM9UC&q=The+Philippine+economy+under+Marcos:+A+balance+sheet |title=The Philippine Economy: Development, Policies, and Challenges |last1=Balisacan |first1=A.

One of the more prominent victims of Martial Law was Cavite City resident and University of the Philippines student leader Emmanuel Alvarez. Alvarez, a descendant of Katipunan General Pascual Alvarez, became one of the ''desaparecidos'' of [[Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos]] when he was accosted by two men believed to be military personnel while commuting from his home in Cavite City on January 6, 1976, and never seen again.<ref name="BantayogFoundationProfileAlvarez">{{cite web | url=https://bantayog.foundation/alvarez-emmanuel-i | title=ALVAREZ, Emmanuel I }}</ref>  He has formally been honored as a hero of Philippine democracy, having had his name etched on the wall of remembrance of the Philippines' [[Bantayog ng mga Bayani]].<ref name="BantayogFoundationProfileAlvarez"/>

===Reclamation===
[[File:Samonte Park (San Roque, Cavite City)(2017-04-03) 1.jpg|thumb|Samonte Park.]]
In the latter part of the 1960s and early 1970s, the land adjacent to the San Roque isthmus was [[reclaimed]].  The new land is now occupied by the [[San Sebastian College – Recoletos de Cavite]] and some residential homes. The present Cavite City Hall is built where the north tower of the old western wall once stood, which was already partly reclaimed by 1945.<ref name=bomb/>

Half of the old port city, including Fort San Felipe, is now occupied by [[Naval Base Cavite]] and is closed to the public.  The old historic core of Cavite is now part of the San Roque district, and is referred to today as either Fort San Felipe or Porta Vaga.<ref name=about/>  The former location of the Porta Vaga Gate, the western wall, and its towers is now occupied by the Governor Samonte Park.

==Geography==
[[File:Cavite Boulevard sketch by Burnham.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cavite City and peninsula (lower left) in relation to the City of Manila (upper middle).]]
Cavite City occupies most of the hook-shaped [[Cavite Peninsula]] that juts into [[Manila Bay]]. The peninsula is lined by [[Bacoor Bay]] to the southeast. The peninsula ends in two tips – Sangley Point and Cavite Point. [[Cañacao Bay]] is the body of water formed between the points. Cavite Point was the location of the old historic Port of Cavite.  Both Bacoor and Cañacao Bays are inland bays within the larger Manila Bay. The city's only land border is with the Municipality of [[Noveleta]] to the south.

The city is the northernmost settlement in the Province of Cavite, which lies southwest from [[Manila]] with a direct distance of about {{convert|11|km|sp=us}} but about {{convert|35|km|sp=us}} overland/by road. Sangley Point, the former location of the [[United States]] [[Sangley Point Naval Base]], is the northernmost point of the city, peninsula and province. The former American military naval base has since been converted into a [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|Philippine military]] base.

The historic island of [[Corregidor Island|Corregidor]], the adjacent islands and detached rocks of [[Caballo Island|Caballo]], [[Fort Frank|Carabao]], [[Fort Drum (El Fraile Island)|El Fraile]] and [[La Monja Island|La Monja]] found at the mouth of Manila Bay are part of the city's territorial jurisdiction.

===Climate===
Cavite City has a [[tropical savanna climate|tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] Aw), with a pronounced dry season from December to April, and a lengthy wet season from May to November that brings abundant rainfall into the city.

==== Nuestra Señora de la Soledad de Porta Vaga ====
{{Main|Our Lady of Porta Vaga}}The [[Nuestra Señora de la Soledad de Porta Vaga]] (Our Lady of Solitude of Porta Vaga) is viewed as the patroness of Cavite City. She is revered by Catholics as the Celestial Guardian and Protector of the Province of [[Cavite]] since her arrival. The image of Our Lady of Porta Vaga is designated as a National Cultural Treasure<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hermoso |first1=Christina |title=Our Lady Soledad de Porta Vaga replica image on display at Radio Veritas |url=https://mb.com.ph/2023/8/8/our-lady-soledad-de-porta-vaga-replica-image-on-display-at-radio-veritas |access-date=6 February 2024 |work=Manila Bulletin |date=8 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231130234104/https://mb.com.ph/2023/8/8/our-lady-soledad-de-porta-vaga-replica-image-on-display-at-radio-veritas |archive-date=30 November 2023}}</ref> by the National Museum. It is the oldest existing [[Virgin Mary|Marian]] painting in the Philippines.

[[File:Porta Vaga Church, Cavite City in 1899.jpg|thumb|The ''Ermita de Porta Vaga'' or Porta Vaga Church, one of the churches in Cavite Puerto, where Our Lady of Solitude was enshrined with the western wall, visible to the left of the building.]]
The image of the virgin is painted on a canvas. Mary, clothed in black and white like a lady in mourning, kneels as she contemplates the passion of her son. Before her are the crown of thorns and the nails used during the Crucifixion. An inscription was found on the back of the painting – ''A doze de Abril 1692 años Juan Oliba puso esta Stma. Ymagen Haqui'', which means, "The sacred image was placed here by Juan Oliba on April 12, 1692". This particular icon was used to bless the galleons sailing between Cavite and Acapulco (Mexico) during formal sending off ceremonies, and was also called the Patroness of the Galleons.

The image was originally enshrined at the ''Ermita de Porta Vaga'', a small church adjacent to the Porta Vaga Gate, which was destroyed during World War II. The image is presently enshrined at the San Roque Parish Church, one of the three parishes in the city.

===Languages===
[[Chabacano]] is a Spanish-influenced [[creole language]] formerly spoken by majority of the people living in the city. Chabacano emerged sometime after the arrival of the first Spaniards and Mexicans in the late 16th century. During this period, the people that lived near the military arsenal in Cavite City communicated with Spaniards and Mexicans and began to incorporate Spanish words into their dialect. Today, a majority of residents speak [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].

Today, Chabacano is generally considered to be dying, with only a fraction of people, mostly elderly, able to speak the language. According to the Philippine professor Alfredo B. German, who wrote a thesis on the grammar of Chabacano, the present conditions do not encourage people to learn the dialect. There are many likely reasons for the diminishing of Chabacano, such as the influx of [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]-speaking migrants and intermarriage.

Philippine writer and poet Jesus Balmori expressed himself in Chabacano, and wrote several verses in it. Don Jaime de Veyra, writer and famous Philippine historian, wrote the following lines: "I am afraid that the inevitable absorption of the 'Tagalog invasion' on one side and the 'invasion of the English' on the other hand, will wipe out or extinguish this inherited Castilian language in existence with its last representatives in the following generation." Professor Gervacio Miranda, who also wrote a book in Chabacano, said in his preface: "My only objective to write this book is to possibly conserve in written form the Chabacano of [[Cavite]] for posterity," fearing the extinction of the dialect.

==Symbols==

===Flag===
The flag of the city was created by Mayor Timoteo O. Encarnacion Jr., and was adopted by the [[City Council|Sangguniang Panlungsod]] through Resolution No. 95-081 dated September 6, 1995, in time for the 55th Cavite City Charter Day.  The meaning and significance of the flag components are:
* The two red strips symbolize courage and bravery.
* The middle green strip symbolizes progress and advancement
* The half sun has a twofold meaning. If it is the rising sun, it means hope, dreams, and visions for progress. If it is a setting sun, it stands for the sunset that can be seen from the city's western shores.
* The five yellow stars symbolize the five districts of Cavite City.
* The three sets of waves below the half sun, in three colors of navy blue, light blue and white, signify that Cavite City is a peninsula surrounded by water, while the three colors represent Cañacao Bay, Bacoor Bay, and Manila Bay.

===Seal===
The current seal of the city was designed by Mayor Timoteo O. Encarnacion, Jr. It was adopted by the [[City Council|Sangguniang Panlungsod]] through Resolution No. 140-90, then approved by the Local Executive on September 7, 1990. On November 3, 1993, the [[National Historical Institute]] and the president, through the [[Department of the Interior and Local Government]], issued a Certificate of Registration recognizing the new seal.

The shield stands for bravery and fortitude. The colors red, white, blue, yellow stand for the loyalty of the people to its government. The inclusion of the rays portrays the role of Cavite as one of the original provinces that rose up in arms against Spanish domination in 1896 in the [[Philippine Revolution]].<ref name=about/>

The white triangle inscribed within the shield with the letters KKK at the corners represents the part played by The city in the organization of the [[Katipunan]]. Don [[Ladislao Diwa]] of the city was one of the triumvirate who organized the patriotic group. Many [[Katipuneros]] came from the city.

Within the white triangle are symbols representing various events:
* At the bottom of the triangle is a fort with figures "1872" symbolizing the [[Cavite mutiny of 1872]] at the Cavite Arsenal.
* At the background is a map of the city including the island of [[Corregidor]] representing the role of the island in the city's history.
* The [[obelisk]] at the left memorializes the [[Thirteen Martyrs of Cavite]] who were executed by the Spaniards on September 12, 1896.
* The sheet music at the right symbolizes [[Julián Felipe]], composer of the [[Lupang Hinirang|Philippine National Anthem]] who was from the city.
* The fort symbol represents the Royal Fort of San Felipe and its role in the city and country's history, being the place where the "thirteen martyrs of Cavite" were detained and where the [[Cavite mutiny of 1872]] took place.
* The scroll on the uppermost portion of the triangle contains the City motto "Para Dios y Patria" ("For God and Country") in the [[Chabacano]] dialect to emphasize the native dialect of the city.
* The green laurel leaf encircling the right and left portions of the KKK triangle symbolizes victories by reason.<ref name=about/>
