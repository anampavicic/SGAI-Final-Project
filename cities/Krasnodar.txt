The city stands on the [[Kuban River]] in [[southern Russia]], with a population of 1,121,291 residents, and up to 1.226 million residents in the [[Krasnodar Urban Okrug|Urban Okrug]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Оценка численности постоянного населения Краснодарского края на 1 января 2023 года|url=https://krsdstat.gks.ru/storage/mediabank/MO%20cisl.htm|publisher=[[Federal State Statistics Service (Russia)|Federal State Statistics Service]]|accessdate=12 April 2023}}</ref> In the past decade Krasnodar has experienced rapid population growth, rising to become the [[List of cities and towns in Russia by population|thirteenth-largest city]] in Russia, and the second-largest city in southern Russia, as well as the [[Southern Federal District]]. 

The city originated in 1793 as a fortress built by the [[Cossacks]], and became a trading center for southern Russia. The city sustained heavy damage in [[World War II]] but was rebuilt and renovated after the war. Krasnodar is a major economic hub in southern Russia; In 2012, ''[[Forbes]]'' named Krasnodar the best city for business in Russia. Krasnodar is home to numerous sights, including the [[Krasnodar Stadium]]. Its main airport is [[Krasnodar International Airport]].

==Name==
Krasnodar was founded on January&nbsp;12, 1794 ([[Gregorian calendar]])<ref name="HolidayFoundation">Charter of Krasnodar, Article&nbsp;1</ref> as ''Yekaterinodar'' ({{lang|ru|Екатеринода́р}}). The original name meant "Catherine's Gift", recognizing both [[Catherine the Great]]'s grant of land in the [[Kuban]] region to the [[Black Sea Cossack Host|Black Sea Cossacks]]<ref name="Azarenkova9">Azarenkova et al., pp.&nbsp;9ff.</ref> (created from former [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]]) and [[Saint Catherine of Alexandria]], who is considered to be the patron of the city. City status was granted in 1867.<ref name="gr">''Cities and Towns of Russia Encyclopedia'', pp.&nbsp;217–218</ref>

On December&nbsp;7, 1920, as a result of the [[October Revolution]], Yekaterinodar was renamed ''Krasnodar'' (''Gift of the Reds'').<ref name="Azarenkova253">Azarenkova et al., p.&nbsp;253.</ref> The new name consists of ''Krasno-'' (Красно- – 'red', i.e. [[Communism|Communist]], but also archaic/poetic form of 'beautiful'); and ''dar'' (дар – 'gift').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edukuban.ru/obsheeobr/kubanoved/imya_Ekaterina/Pereimenovanie.doc |title=Renaming of the city of Yekaterinodar |publisher=Official site of the Education and Science Department of Krasnodar Krai |access-date=December 4, 2010 |language=ru |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404205628/http://www.edukuban.ru/obsheeobr/kubanoved/imya_Ekaterina/Pereimenovanie.doc |archive-date=April 4, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[File:Yekaterinodar-from-south.jpg|thumb|left|Yekaterinodar in the early 20th century]]

The city originated in 1793 as a military camp, then as a [[fortress]] built by the [[Cossacks]] to defend imperial borders and to assert Russian dominion over [[Circassia]], a claim which [[Ottoman Turkey]] contested. In the first half of the 19th century, Yekaterinodar grew into a busy center of the [[Kuban Cossacks]], gaining official town status in 1867.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Krasnodar-Russia|title='Rachel's Challenge' promotes little acts of kindness among Calgary kids |publisher=britannica.com |date=2009-01-14 |access-date=2017-03-09}}</ref> By 1888 about 45,000 people lived in the city, which had become a vital trade center for southern Russia. In 1897 an [[obelisk]] commemorating the two-hundred-year history of the [[Kuban Cossacks]] (seen as founded in 1696) was erected in Yekaterinodar. The city was the administrative center of the [[Yekaterinodarsky Otdel]] of the [[Kuban Oblast]].

During the [[Russian Civil War]] (1917-1922) the city changed hands several times, coming successively under the control of the [[Red Army]] and of the [[Volunteer Army]]. Many Kuban Cossacks, as committed anti-[[Bolsheviks]], supported the [[White Movement]]. [[Lavr Kornilov]], a White general, captured the city on April 10, 1918, only to be killed a week later when a Bolshevik [[artillery shell]] blew up the farmhouse where he had set up his headquarters. During the [[Soviet famine of 1932–1933]] Krasnodar lost over 14% of its population.<ref name="Wolowyna 2020">{{cite journal|last=Wolowyna|first=Oleh|date=October 2020|title=A Demographic Framework for the 1932–1934 Famine in the Soviet Union|journal=Journal of Genocide Research|volume=23|issue=4|pages=501–526|doi=10.1080/14623528.2020.1834741|s2cid=226316468 }}</ref>

During [[World War II]] units of the [[Nazi Germany|German Army]] occupied Krasnodar between August 9, 1942, and February 12, 1943 as part of [[Battle of the Caucasus|Operation Edelweiss]]. The city sustained heavy damage in the fighting but was rebuilt and renovated after the war. German forces, including [[Gestapo]] and [[Einsatzgruppen|mobile SS execution squads]], killed thousands of [[Jews]], [[Communists]], and suspected Communist [[Partisan (military)|partisans]]. Shooting, [[hanging]], burning, and even [[gas vans]] were used.<ref>Lichtblau (2014), p. 47-48</ref>

In the summer of 1943, the Soviets began trials, including of their own citizens, for collusion with the Nazis and for participation in [[war crimes]]. The first such trial took place at Krasnodar from July 14 to 17, 1943. The Krasnodar tribunal pronounced eight death sentences, which were summarily carried out in the city square in front of a crowd of about thirty thousand people.

On June 14, 1971, a [[1971 Krasnodar bus bombing|bombing]] occurred on a bus in the city, when a homemade suitcase bomb placed near the gas tank by a mentally ill Peter Volynsky exploded. The bomb killed 10 persons and wounded 20–90 others.

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Krasnodar}}Krasnodar is the largest city and capital of Krasnodar Krai by population and the second-largest by area. It is the 17th-largest city in Russia {{as of|2010|lc=y|post=}} and the 13th-largest city in Russia as of 2021. It is located on the right bank of the Kuban River. It is 1300 km south of the Russian capital, Moscow. The Black Sea lies 120 km to the west.

===Climate===
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Krasnodar has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa''), bordering closely on a hot-summer [[humid continental climate]], very similar to that of [[New York City]].

Winters are cold and damp, with unstable snow cover. The average temperature in January, the area's coldest month, is {{convert|1|C}}. Weather conditions in winter vary greatly in the city; temperatures can exceed {{convert|20|C}} for a few days, but temperatures below {{convert|-20|C}} are not uncommon for Krasnodar as the city is not protected by mountains from cold waves. Summers are typically hot, with a July average of {{convert|24.1|C}}.

The city receives {{convert|735|mm|sp=us}} of precipitation annually, fairly spread throughout the year. Extreme storms are rare in the Krasnodar area. Extreme temperatures have ranged from {{convert|-32.9|to|40.7|C|F}}, recorded on January&nbsp;11, 1940 and July&nbsp;30, 2000, respectively.
