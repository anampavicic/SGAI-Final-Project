''Tripoli'' may also refer to the {{lang|ar-Latn|[[sha'biyah]]}} (top-level administrative division in the Libyan system), the [[Tripoli District, Libya|Tripoli District]].

==Name==
In the [[Arab world]], Tripoli is also known as '''Tripoli-of-the-West''' ({{langx|ar|ÿ∑ÿ±ÿßÿ®ŸÑÿ≥ ÿßŸÑÿ∫ÿ±ÿ®}} {{lang|ar-Latn|·π¨arƒÅbulus al-Gharb}}), to distinguish it from [[Tripoli, Lebanon]], known in Arabic as {{lang|ar-Latn|·π¨arƒÅbulus ash-Sham}} ({{lang|ar|ÿ∑ÿ±ÿßÿ®ŸÑÿ≥ ÿßŸÑÿ¥ÿßŸÖ}}), meaning 'Tripoli of the East' or '[[Levant]]ine Tripoli'. It is affectionately called "The Mermaid of the Mediterranean" ({{lang|ar|ÿπÿ±Ÿàÿ≥ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ≠ÿ±}} {{lang|ar-Latn| øAr≈´sat al-Ba·∏•r}}; lit: 'bride of the sea'), describing its turquoise waters and  whitewashed buildings.

The name derives from {{langx|grc|Œ§œÅŒØœÄŒøŒªŒπœÇ|translit=Tripolis}}, literally "three cities", referring to Oea, [[Sabratha]] and [[Leptis Magna]]. The city of Oea was the only one of the three to survive antiquity, and became known as Tripoli, within a wider region known as [[Tripolitania]]. Neighboring Sabratha was sometimes referred to by sailors as "Old Tripoli".

In Arabic, it is called {{lang|ar|ÿ∑ÿ±ÿßÿ®ŸÑÿ≥}}, {{lang|ar-Latn|·π¨arƒÅbulus}} ({{Audio|Ar-tarabulus.ogg|pronunciation}}; [[Libyan Arabic]]: {{lang|ar-Latn-LY|·π¨rƒÅbl…ôs}}, {{Audio|Ar-ly-Trables.ogg|pronunciation}}; [[Berber language|Berber]]: {{lang|ber-Latn|·π¨rables}}, from {{langx|grc|Œ§œÅŒØœÄŒøŒªŒπœÇ|links=Tripoli Œ§œÅŒØœÄŒøŒªŒ∑.ogg}} {{lang|grc-Latn|Tr√≠polis}}, {{IPA audio link|Tripoli Œ§œÅŒØœÄŒøŒªŒ∑.ogg}} from {{langx |grc|text=Œ§œÅŒµŒπœÇ Œ†œåŒªŒµŒπœÇ |translit=Treis P√≥leis |lit=three cities}}).

===Oea and Tripolitania===
{{Main|Oea|Tripolitania}}

The city was founded in the 7th century BC by the [[Phoenicia]]ns, who gave it the [[Libyco-Berber]] name Oyat ([[Punic language|Punic]]: ê§Öê§â‚Ä¨‚Ä¨ê§è‚Ä¨ê§ï‚Ä¨, ''wy øt''),<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> suggesting that the city may have been built upon an existing native [[Berbers|Berber]] city.{{citation needed|date=February 2024}} The Phoenicians were probably attracted to the site by its natural harbor, flanked on the western shore by the small, easily defensible [[peninsula]], on which they established their colony. The city then passed into the hands of the Greek rulers of [[Cyrenaica]] as '''Oea''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ·ΩàŒØŒ±, ''O√≠a''). Cyrene was a colony on the North African shore, a bit east of Tambroli and halfway to [[Egypt]]. The [[Carthaginians]] later wrested it again from the [[Greeks]].

By the later half of the 2nd century BC, it belonged to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who included it in their province of [[Africa Province|Africa]], and gave it the name of "Regio Syrtica". Around the beginning of the 3rd century [[Anno Domini|AD]], it became known as the [[Tripolitania (Roman province)|Regio Tripolitana]], meaning "region of the three cities", namely Oea (''i.e.'', modern Tripoli), [[Sabratha]] and [[Leptis Magna]]. It was probably raised to the rank of a separate province by [[Septimius Severus]], who was a native of [[Leptis Magna]].

[[File:Marcus Aurelius Arch Tripoli Libya.jpg|thumb|left|Roman [[Arch of Marcus Aurelius (Tripoli)|Arch of Marcus Aurelius]]]]

In spite of centuries of Roman habitation, the only visible Roman remains, apart from scattered [[column]]s and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] (usually integrated in later buildings), is the Arch of [[Marcus Aurelius]] from the 2nd century AD. The fact that Tripoli has been continuously inhabited, unlike ''e.g.'', Sabratha and Leptis Magna, has meant that the inhabitants have either quarried material from older buildings (destroying them in the process) or built on top of them, burying them beneath the streets, where they remain largely unexcavated.

There is evidence to suggest that the Tripolitania region was in some economic decline during the 5th and 6th centuries, in part due to the political unrest spreading across the Mediterranean world in the wake of the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]], as well as pressure from the invading [[Vandals]]. It is recorded by [[Ibn Abd al-Hakam]] that during the siege of Tripoli by a general of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] named [[Amr ibn al-As]], seven of his soldiers from the clan of Madhlij, sub branch of [[Kinana]], unintentionally found a section on the western side of Tripoli beach that was not walled during their hunting routine.<ref name="Ibn Abd al Hakam" /> Those seven soldiers then managed to infiltrate through this way without being detected by the city guards, then managed to incite a riot within the city while shouting Takbir, causing the confused Byzantine garrison soldiers to think the Muslim forces were already inside in the city and flee towards their ship leaving Tripoli, thus allowing Amr to subdue the city easily.<ref name="Ibn Abd al Hakam">{{cite web |last1=Khalid |first1=Mahmud |title=Libya in the shadows of Islam..

According to [[al-Baladhuri]], Tripoli was, unlike Western North Africa, taken by the Muslims very early after [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Alexandria]], in the 22nd year of the [[Hijri year|Hijra]], that is between 30 November 642 and 18 November 643 AD. Following the conquest, Tripoli was ruled by dynasties based in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]] (first the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]], [[Banu Khazrun]], and later the [[Mamluk]]s), and [[Kairouan]] in [[Ifriqiya]] (the Arab [[Fihrids|Fihrid]], [[Muhallabids|Muhallabid]], and [[Aghlabid dynasty|Aghlabid]] dynasties). For some time it was a part of the [[Berbers|Berber]] [[Almohad Caliphate]], [[Hafsid dynasty|Hafsid Kingdom]], and [[Banu Thabit]] dynasty.

===16th to 19th centuries===
[[File:Tripoli by Piri Reis.jpg|thumb|left|Historic map of Tripoli by [[Piri Reis]]]]

In 1510, the city was conquered by [[Pedro Navarro, Count of Oliveto]] for Spain. In 1530, it was assigned together with Malta to the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of St. John]], who had been expelled by the [[Ottoman Turks]] from their stronghold on the island of [[Rhodes]].<ref>Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/Tripoli Tripoli], britannica.com, USA, accessed on 7 July 2019</ref> Finding themselves in hostile territory, the Knights reinforced the city walls and built  defenses. Though built on top of older buildings (possibly including a Roman public bath), much of the earliest defensive structures of the Tripoli castle (or "Assaraya al-Hamra", ''i.e.'', the "[[Red Castle of Tripoli|Red Castle]]") are attributed to the Knights of St John.

Having previously combated [[piracy]] from their base on [[Rhodes]], the  Knights were given charge of the city  to prevent it from being retaken by [[Barbary pirate]]s.  The disruption the pirates caused to the Christian shipping lanes in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] had been one of the main incentives for the Spanish conquest of the city.

The knights held the city  until the [[Siege of Tripoli (1551)|Siege of Tripoli]] in 1551 and their surrender to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], led by the Muslim Turkish commander [[Turgut Reis]].<ref>{{cite book |author= Reynolds, Clark G. |title= Command of the Sea&nbsp;‚Äì The History and Strategy of Maritime Empires |publisher= Morrow |year= 1974 |pages= 120‚Äì121 |isbn= 978-0-688-00267-1 |quote= Ottomans extended their western maritime frontier across North Africa under the naval command of another Greek Moslem, Torghoud (or Dragut), who succeeded Barbarossa upon the latter's death in 1546.}}</ref> Turgut Reis served as pasha of Tripoli.

His body was taken from [[Malta]], where he had fallen during [[Great Siege of Malta|the Ottoman siege of the island]], to a tomb in the [[Sidi Darghut Mosque]] which he had established close to his palace in Tripoli. The palace has since disappeared (supposedly it was situated between the so-called "Ottoman prison" and the [[Arch of Marcus Aurelius (Tripoli)|Arch of Marcus Aurelius]]), but the mosque, along with his tomb, still stands, close to the Bab Al-Bahr gate.

After the capture by the Ottoman Turks, Tripoli once again became a base of operation for Barbary pirates. One of several Western attempts to dislodge them again was a Royal Navy attack under [[John Narborough]] in 1675, of which a vivid eye-witness account has survived.<ref>''The Diary of [[Henry Teonge]] Chaplain on Board HM's Ships Assistance, Bristol and Royal Oak 1675‚Äì1679.

Intended to function as enforcers of local administration, the captain of the Janissaries and his cronies were often the ''de facto'' rulers.

In 1711, [[Ahmed Karamanli]], a Janissary officer of Turkish origin, killed the Ottoman governor, the "[[Pasha]]", and established himself as ruler of the Tripolitania region. By 1714, he had asserted a sort of semi-independence from the Ottoman Sultan, heralding in the [[Karamanli dynasty]]. The Pashas of Tripoli were expected to pay a regular tributary tax to the Sultan but were in all other aspects rulers of an independent kingdom. This order of things continued under the rule of his descendants, accompanied by the brazen piracy and blackmailing until 1835 when the Ottoman Empire took advantage of an internal struggle and re-established its authority.

The Ottoman province (''vilayet'') of Tripoli (including the dependent ''[[sanjak]]'' of [[Cyrenaica]]) lay along the southern shore of the Mediterranean between [[Tunisia]] in the west and [[Egypt]] in the east. Besides the city itself, the area included Cyrenaica (the Barca plateau), the chain of [[oases]] in the Aujila depression, [[Fezzan]] and the oases of [[Ghadames]] and [[Ghat, Libya|Ghat]], separated by sandy and stony wastelands. A 16th century Chinese source mentioned Tripoli and described its agricultural and textile products.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Chen |first=Yuan Julian |date=2021-10-11 |title=Between the Islamic and Chinese Universal Empires: The Ottoman Empire, Ming Dynasty, and Global Age of Explorations |url=https://www.academia.edu/59068575 |journal=Journal of Early Modern History |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=422‚Äì456 |doi=10.1163/15700658-bja10030 |s2cid=244587800 |issn=1385-3783}}</ref>

===Barbary Wars (1801 - 1815)===
{{Main|First Barbary War|Second Barbary War}}
[[File:Burning of the uss philadelphia.jpg|thumb|upright|The USS ''Philadelphia'', heavy frigate of the [[United States Navy]], burning at the [[Second Battle of Tripoli Harbor]] during the [[First Barbary War]] in 1804]]

In the early part of the 19th century, the regency at Tripoli, owing to its [[piracy|piratical]] practices, was twice involved in war with the United States. In May 1801, the pasha demanded an increase in the tribute ($83,000) which the U.S. government had been paying since 1796 for the protection of their commerce from piracy under the [[Treaty with Tripoli (1796)|1796 Treaty with Tripoli]]. The demand was refused by third President [[Thomas Jefferson]], and a naval force was sent from the United States to blockade Tripoli.

The [[First Barbary War]] (1801‚Äì1805) dragged on for four years. In 1803, Tripolitan fighters captured the U.S. Navy heavy frigate ''[[USS Philadelphia (1799)|Philadelphia]]'' and took its commander, Captain [[William Bainbridge]], and the entire crew as prisoners. This was after the ''Philadelphia'' was run aground when the captain tried to navigate too close to the port of Tripoli. After several hours aground and Tripolitan gun boats firing upon the ''Philadelphia'', though none ever struck the ''Philadelphia'', Captain Bainbridge made the decision to surrender. The ''Philadelphia'' was later turned against the Americans and anchored in Tripoli Harbor as a gun battery while her officers and crew were held prisoners in Tripoli. The following year, U.S. Navy Lieutenant [[Stephen Decatur]] led a successful daring nighttime raid to retake and burn the warship rather than see it remain in enemy hands. Decatur's men set fire to the ''Philadelphia'' and escaped.

A notable incident in the war was the expedition undertaken by diplomatic Consul [[William Eaton (soldier)|William Eaton]] with the objective of replacing the pasha with an elder brother living in exile, who had promised to accede to all the wishes of the United States. Eaton, at the head of a mixed force of US Soldiers, Sailors, and Marines, along with Greek, Arab and Turkish mercenaries numbering approximately 500, marched across the Egyptian / Libyan desert from [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]] and with the aid of three American warships, succeeded in [[Battle of Derna (1805)|capturing Derna]]. Soon afterward, on 3 June 1805, peace was concluded. The pasha ended his demands and received $60,000 as ransom for the ''Philadelphia'' prisoners under the [[Treaty with Tripoli (1805)|1805 Treaty with Tripoli]].

In 1815, in consequence of further outrages and due to the humiliation of the earlier defeat, Captains Bainbridge and [[Stephen Decatur]], at the head of an American squadron, again visited Tripoli and forced the pasha to comply with the demands of the United States. See [[Second Barbary War]].

===Late Ottoman era (1835‚Äì1912)===
[[File:Ottoman Clock Tower Tripoli.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Ottoman era|Ottoman]] [[Clock tower]] in Tripoli's old town medina]]

In 1835, the Ottomans took advantage of a local civil war to reassert their direct authority. After that date, Tripoli was under the direct control of the [[Sublime Porte]]. Rebellions in 1842 and 1844 were unsuccessful. After the [[French occupation of Tunisia]] (1881), the Ottomans increased their garrison in Tripoli considerably.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=September 2015}}

By the [[Italo-Turkish War#Treaty of Ouchy|Treaty of Lausanne]], Italian sovereignty over [[Italian Tripolitania|Tripolitania]] and [[Italian Cyrenaica|Cyrenaica]] was acknowledged by the Ottomans, although the [[caliph]] was permitted to exercise religious authority. Italy officially granted autonomy after the war, but gradually occupied the region. Originally administered as part of a single colony, Tripoli and its surrounding province were a separate colony from 26 June 1927 to 3 December 1934, when all Italian possessions in North Africa were merged into one colony.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dadfeatured.blogspot.com/2018/10/was-capital-of-italian-libya.html|title=Dadfeatured: ITALIAN TRIPOLI|date=17 October 2018}}</ref> By 1938, Tripoli<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ernandes.net/ricordi/rionelido/cap01/tripolimap30.jpg|title=Map of Italian Tripoli in 1930}}</ref> had 108,240 inhabitants, including 39,096 Italians.<ref>''The Statesman's Yearbook 1948''. [[Palgrave Macmillan]]. p. 1040.</ref>

Tripoli underwent a huge architectural and urbanistic improvement under Italian rule:<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_lrYlxdX7DIC&pg=PA17|title=Architecture and Tourism in Italian Colonial Libya: An Ambivalent Modernism|first=Brian|last=McLaren|date=29 January 2017|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=9780295985428}}</ref> the first thing the Italians did was to create in the early 1920s a sewage system (that until then it lacked) and a modern hospital.

In the coast of the province was built in 1937‚Äì1938 a section of the [[Via Balbia|Litoranea Balbia]], a road that went from Tripoli and Tunisia's frontier to the border of [[Egypt]]. The [[car tag]] for the Italian province of Tripoli was "TL".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.targheitaliane.it/index_i.html?/italy/colonie/libia_i.html|title=Benvenuto in Targhe a Roma|language=it|publisher=targheitaliane.it|first=Michele|last=Berionne|access-date=8 July 2019}}</ref>

Furthermore, in 1927, the Italians founded the [[Tripoli International Fair]],with the goal of promoting Tripoli's economy. This is the oldest trade fair in Africa.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tif History|url=http://www.gbf.com.ly/tif37/english/tifhistory.php|work=gbf.com.ly|year=2008|access-date=6 March 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330161805/http://www.gbf.com.ly/tif37/english/tifhistory.php|archive-date=30 March 2009}}</ref> The so-called ''Fiera internazionale di Tripoli'' was one of the main international "Fairs" in the colonial world in the 1930s, and was internationally promoted together with the [[Tripoli Grand Prix]] as a showcase of [[Italian Libya]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cronologia.leonardo.it/storia/a1937f.htm|title=MUSULMANI ‚Äì 1937 ‚Äì L'ITALIA IN MEDIO ORIENTE|access-date=1 September 2013|archive-date=25 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925120216/http://cronologia.leonardo.it/storia/a1937f.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Italians created the [[Tripoli Grand Prix]], an international motor racing event first held in 1925 on a racing circuit outside Tripoli. The Tripoli Grand Prix took place until 1940.<ref>{{YouTube|KEtz-wzbs9Y|Video of Tripoli Grand Prix}}</ref> The first airport in Libya, the [[Mellaha Air Base]] was built by the [[Italian Air Force]] in 1923 near the Tripoli racing circuit. The airport is currently called [[Mitiga International Airport]].

Tripoli even had a railway station with some [[Italian Libya Railways|small railway connections to nearby cities]], when in August 1941 the Italians started to build a new {{convert|1040|km|0|abbr=off|adj=on|sp=us}} railway (with a {{convert|1435|mm|ftin|1|abbr=on}} gauge, like the one used in Egypt and Tunisia) between Tripoli and [[Benghazi]]. But the war stopped the construction the next year.

Tripoli was controlled by Italy until 1943 when the provinces of [[Tripolitania]] and [[Cyrenaica]] were captured by Allied forces. The city fell to troops of the British [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] on 23 January 1943.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://olive-drab.com/od_history_ww2_ops_battles_1943tunisia.php| title = Tunisia and Kasserine Pass}}</ref> Tripoli was then governed by the British until independence in 1951. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of peace with Italy (1947)|1947 peace treaty]] with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], Italy relinquished all claims to Libya.<ref>Hagos, Tecola W.

===Gaddafi era (1969‚Äì2011)===
{{Expand section|date=February 2016}}

Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi]] became leader of Libya on 1 September 1969 after a successful coup d'√©tat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/tripoli-architect-remembers-its-glorious-days/ |title=Tripoli architect remembers its glorious days |publisher=Indianexpress.com |date= 2 September 2011|access-date=2022-03-13}}</ref>

On 15 April 1986, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] ordered major bombing raids, dubbed [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]], against Tripoli and [[Benghazi]], killing 45 Libyan military and government personnel as well as 15 civilians. This strike followed US interception of telex messages from Libya's East Berlin embassy suggesting the involvement of Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] in a [[1986 Berlin discotheque bombing|bomb explosion on 5 April]] in [[West Berlin]]'s La Belle discoth√®que, a nightclub frequented by US servicemen. Among the alleged fatalities of the 15 April retaliatory attack by the United States was Gaddafi's adopted daughter, [[Hana Gaddafi]].

The [[United Nations]] sanctions against Libya imposed in April 1992 under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 748|Security Council Resolution 748]] were lifted in September 2003, which increased traffic through the Port of Tripoli and through airports in Libya. This lifting of the resolution had a positive impact on the city's economy allowing for more goods to enter the city.

===Libyan Civil War (2011)===
{{See also|Libyan civil war (2011)|Battle of Tripoli (2011)|2019‚Äì20 Western Libya offensive}}
[[File:Battle of Tripoli.svg|thumb|400px|Front lines during the Battle of Tripoli (20‚Äì28 August 2011)]]

In February and March 2011, Tripoli witnessed intense [[2011 Tripoli clashes|anti-government protests and violent government responses]] resulting in hundreds killed and wounded. The city's [[Green Square, Tripoli|Green Square]] was the scene of some of the protests. The anti-Gaddafi protests were eventually crushed, and Tripoli was the site of pro-Gaddafi rallies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.libyafeb17.com/2011/02/pro-gaddafi-demonstrations-in-tripoli/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720154815/http://archive.libyafeb17.com/2011/02/pro-gaddafi-demonstrations-in-tripoli/|url-status=usurped|archive-date=20 July 2013|title=Pro-Gaddafi demonstrations in Tripoli ‚Äì Libya February 17th ‚Äì Archive site}}</ref>

The city defenses loyal to Gaddafi included the military headquarters at [[Bab al-Azizia|Bab al-Aziziyah]] (where Gaddafi's main residence was located) and the [[Mitiga International Airport]]. At the latter, on 13 March, Ali Atiyya, a colonel of the [[Libyan Air Force (1951‚Äì2011)|Libyan Air Force]], defected and joined the revolution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.libyafeb17.com/2011/03/crowd-mourns-ali-hassan-al-jabir/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712013133/http://archive.libyafeb17.com/2011/03/crowd-mourns-ali-hassan-al-jabir/ |url-status=usurped |archive-date=12 July 2012 |title=Breaking: Body of Al Jazeera Cameraman Ali Al Jabir Arrives in Doha |publisher=Libyafeb17.com |date=13 March 2011 |access-date=20 March 2011}}</ref>

In late February, rebel forces took control of [[Zawiya, Libya|Zawiya]], a city approximately {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} to the west of Tripoli, thus increasing the threat to pro-Gaddafi forces in the capital. During the subsequent [[First Battle of Zawiya|battle of Zawiya]], loyalist forces besieged the city and eventually recaptured it by 10 March.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/10/zawiya-town-itv-regime-battle |title=Zawiya town centre devastated and almost deserted &#124; Libya |first=Bill |last=Neely |date=10 March 2011 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |access-date=2022-03-13}}</ref>

As the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]] commenced on 19 March to enforce a U.N. no-fly zone over the country, the city once again came under air attack. It was the second time that Tripoli was bombed since the 1986 U.S. airstrikes, and the second time since the 1986 airstrike that bombed [[Bab al-Azizia]], Gaddafi's heavily fortified compound.

In July and August, Libyan online revolutionary communities posted tweets and updates on attacks by rebel fighters on pro-government vehicles and checkpoints. In one such attack, [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]] and [[Abdullah Senussi]] were targets.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Worth |first=Robert F. |title=Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam comes out of hiding ‚Äì and wants to be president |newspaper=[[The Times]] |language=en |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/gaddafis-son-saif-al-islam-comes-out-of-hiding-and-wants-to-be-president-hsjnkjdzn |access-date=2023-02-21 |issn=0140-0460}}</ref> The government, however, denied revolutionary activity inside the capital.

Several months after the initial uprising, rebel forces in the [[Nafusa Mountains]] advanced towards the coast, [[Second Battle of Zawiya|retaking Zawiya]] and reaching Tripoli on 21 August. On 21 August, the symbolic Green Square, immediately renamed Martyrs' Square by the rebels, was taken under rebel control and pro-Gaddafi posters were torn down and burned.<ref>{{Cite news |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=2011-08-22 |title=Libyan rebels take Tripoli's Green Square |language=en |work=National Post |url=https://nationalpost.com/news/libyan-rebels-take-tripolis-green-square |access-date=2022-06-08}}</ref>

During a radio address on 1 September, Gaddafi declared that the capital of the [[Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] had been moved from Tripoli to [[Sirte]], after rebels had taken control of Tripoli.

In August and September 2014, Islamist armed groups extended their control of central Tripoli. The [[House of Representatives (Libya)|House of Representatives]] parliament set up operations on a Greek car ferry in [[Tobruk]]. A rival [[New General National Congress]] parliament continued to operate in Tripoli.<ref name="WPost Aug. 24">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/egypt-denies-intervening-in-libya/2014/08/24/88b364ee-2b7d-11e4-be9e-60cc44c01e7f_story.html|title=Libya's Islamist militias claim control of capital|newspaper=The Washington Post|agency=Associated Press|date=24 August 2014|access-date=26 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825135414/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/egypt-denies-intervening-in-libya/2014/08/24/88b364ee-2b7d-11e4-be9e-60cc44c01e7f_story.html|archive-date=25 August 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=guardian-20140909>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/09/libyan-parliament-refuge-greek-car-ferry |title=Libyan parliament takes refuge in Greek car ferry |author=Chris Stephen |newspaper=The Guardian |date=9 September 2014 |access-date=24 September 2014}}</ref>

===Recent developments===
The [[2022 Tripoli clashes]] and [[2023 Tripoli clashes]] continued to disrupt the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Why did clashes break out in Libya's Tripoli? |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/17/why-did-clashes-break-out-in-libyas-tripoli |access-date=2023-08-17 |website=www.aljazeera.com |language=en}}</ref>

==Law and government==
Tripoli and its surrounding suburbs all lie within the [[Tarabulus District|Tripoli sha'biyah]] (district). In accordance with Libya's former [[Jamahiriya]] political system, Tripoli comprises Local People's Congresses where, in theory, the city's population discuss different matters and elect their own people's committee; at present{{when|date=August 2011}} there are 29 Local People's Congresses. In reality, the former revolutionary committees severely limited the democratic process by closely supervising committee and congress elections at the branch and district levels of governments, Tripoli being no exception.

Tripoli is sometimes referred to as "the [[de jure]] capital of Libya" because none of the country's ministries are actually located in the capital. Even the former National General People's Congress was held annually in the city of [[Sirte]] rather than in Tripoli. As part of a radical [[decentralization]] program undertaken by [[Muammar Gaddafi|Gaddafi]] in September 1988, all General People's Committee secretariats ([[Ministry (government department)|ministries]]), except those responsible for foreign liaison ([[foreign policy]] and [[international relations]]) and information, were moved outside Tripoli. According to diplomatic sources, the former Secretariat for Economy and Trade was moved to [[Benghazi]]; the Secretariat for Health to [[Kufra]]; and the remainder, excepting one, to Sirte, [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s birthplace. In early 1993 it was announced that the Secretariat for Foreign Liaison and International Co-operation was to be moved to [[Ra's Lanuf]]. In October 2011, Libya fell to The [[National Transitional Council]] (N.T.C.), which took full control, abolishing the Gaddafi-era system of national and local government.

==Geography==
[[File:Tripolilibyanasa.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of central Tripoli]] [[File:Tripoli, Libya.JPG|thumb|Astronaut view of Tripoli]]

Tripoli lies at the western extremity of Libya close to the Tunisian border, on the continent of Africa. Over a thousand kilometers (621 miles) separates Tripoli from Libya's second largest city, Benghazi. Coastal [[oases]] alternate with sandy areas and [[lagoons]] along the shores of [[Tripolitania]] for more than {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The city lies about 70 kilometers north from the [[Nafusa Mountains]], the source of seasonal rivers like Wadi Al-Mjeneen.

===Administrative division===
Until 2007, the "[[Sha'biyah]]" included the city, its suburbs and their immediate surroundings. In older administrative systems and throughout history, there existed a province ("[[muhafazah]]"), state ("[[wilayah]]") or city-state with a much larger area (though not constant boundaries), which is sometimes mistakenly referred to as Tripoli but more appropriately should be called [[Tripolitania]].

As a District, Tripoli borders the following districts:
* [[Murqub District|Murqub]] ‚Äì east
* [[Jabal al Gharbi District|Jabal al Gharbi]] ‚Äì south
* [[Jafara]] ‚Äì southwest
* [[Zawiya District|Zawiya]] ‚Äì west

===Climate===
Tripoli has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[K√∂ppen climate classification|K√∂ppen]]: ''BSh'')<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kottek|first1=M.|first2=J.|last2=Grieser|first3=C.|last3=Beck|first4=B.|last4=Rudolf|first5=F.|last5=Rubel|date=April 2006|title=World Map of K√∂ppen-Geiger Climate Classification, updated|work=Meteorol. Z.|volume=15|pages=259‚Äì263|url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/pdf/kottek_et_al_2006_A4.pdf}}</ref> with hot and dry, prolonged summers and relatively wet mild winters. Although virtually rainless, summers are hot and muggy with temperatures that often exceed {{convert|38|C|F|0|lk=on}}; average July temperatures are between {{convert|22|and|33|C|F|0}}. In December, temperatures have reached as low as {{convert|0|C|F|0}}, but the average remains at between {{convert|9|and|18|C|F|0}}. The average annual rainfall is less than {{convert|400|mm|in|abbr=off|0|sp=us}}. Snowfall has occurred in past years.<ref name="wmo"/>

The rainfall can be very erratic. Epic floods in 1945 left Tripoli underwater for several days, but two years later an unprecedented [[drought]] caused the loss of thousands of head of cattle. Deficiency in rainfall is no doubt reflected in an absence of permanent rivers or streams in the city as is indeed true throughout the entire country. The allocation of limited water is considered of sufficient importance to warrant the existence of the Secretariat of Dams and Water Resources, and damaging a source of water can be penalized by a heavy fine or imprisonment.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Libya a country study (Area handbook series): Foreign Area Studies|publisher=The American University, Washington, D.C.|year=1979|editor-last=Harold D. Nelson|page=66}}</ref>

The [[Great Manmade River Project|Great Manmade River]], a network of pipelines that transport water from the desert to the coastal cities, supplies Tripoli with its water.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4814988.stm#map | title=Libya's Thirst for 'Fossil Water' | work=[[BBC News]] | date=18 March 2006 | access-date=10 September 2006 |last=Watkins|first=John}}</ref> The grand scheme was initiated by Gaddafi in 1982.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

[[Martyrs' Square, Tripoli|Martyrs' Square]], located near the waterfront is scattered with [[palm trees]], the most abundant plant used for landscaping in the city. The [[Tripoli Zoo]], located south of the city center, is a large reserve of plants, trees and open green spaces and was the country's biggest zoo.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} The zoo was forced to shut for safety reasons due to the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]], with many animals becoming more and more traumatised and distressed. After the overthrow of [[Muammar Gaddafi]], the BBC published a short news film detailing the problems the zoo now faced, from a lack of money to feed the animals, to a fragile security system. The animals, the BBC said, were recovering slowly and returning to normal.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bleak future for Tripoli zoo animals? |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-africa-16371108 |access-date=2022-04-30}}</ref>

In addition to the main prayer space, both of these mosques are accompanied by a complex of other buildings such as [[madrasa]]s, bathhouses, markets ([[Bazaar|''suq''s]]), and the mausoleums of their eponymous founders. Other notable mosques in the city include the Mosque of Sidi Salem (built in the late 15th century and restored in 1670), the Mosque of Mahmud Khaznadar (1680), the Mosque of Shai'b al-Ain (1699), and the [[Gurgi Mosque]] (1834).<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":2" />

The earliest recorded madrasa in the city was the al-Mustansiriyya Madrasa built between 1257 and 1260, but it has not survived.<ref name=":3" /> Today, the Madrasa of Uthman Pasha (1654) is one of the most notable preserved examples of this type of building. Its main component is a square courtyard surrounded by vaulted galleries and small rooms where students lived. Attached to the northeast corner of the building are two square domed chambers, with the smaller one serving as a mosque and the larger one housing the tombs of Uthman Pasha and others.<ref name=":3" />

Of the many [[hammam]]s (bathhouses) that once existed in the city, only three notable examples remain today: the Hammam al-Kabir ("Great Bath"), of which only a large domed chamber survives, the Hammam al-Hilqa, which was still in use in the late 20th century, and the [[Darghouth Turkish Bath|Hammam of Darghut Pasha]], built in the 17th century next to the mosque of the same name.<ref name=":3" />[[File:Tripoli - Karamanli-Haus, 1750.jpg|thumb|upright|The House of Karamanli, or al-Qaramanli House, was built in 1750, during the reign of Ali Pasha Al-Qaramanli, and was used by Yousuf Pasha until his death.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.temehu.com/Cities_sites/museum-of-karamanli-house.htm|title=Karamanly (Qaramanli) House Museum|website=temehu.com}}</ref>]]The Medina also preserves urban [[caravanserai]]s ({{Transliteration|ar|funduq}} in Arabic, plural: {{Transliteration|ar|fanadiq}}) from the Ottoman period.

==Transport==
Two trans-African automobile routes pass through Tripoli:
* [[Cairo-Dakar Highway]]

[[File:Tripoli Airport.jpg|thumb|[[Tripoli International Airport]]]]
[[Tripoli International Airport]] was the largest airport in Tripoli and Libya before being destroyed during the [[Libyan civil war (2014‚Äì2020)|second Libyan civil war]] in 2014. Tripoli has since been served by a smaller local airport [[Mitiga International Airport]], which is currently the largest airport in Libya.

In July 2014, the Tripoli international Airport was destroyed, following the [[Battle of Tripoli Airport]], when [[Zintan Brigades|Zintani]] militias in charge of security were attacked by Islamist militias of the GNC, code naming the operation 'Libya Dawn' also known as "[[Fajr Libya militia|Libya Dawn Militias]]", led by Misurati militia general Salah Badi. The event happened after secular Zintani militias were accused with claims of smuggling drugs, alcohol and illegal items, known to have past ties with the Gaddafi Regime. Libya's Mufti Sadiq al Ghariani has praised the Libya Dawn Operation.

The result of the battle for Tripoli's central airport was its complete destruction with 90% of the facilities incapacitated, or burned down with an unknown estimate Billions of dollars in Damage, with another 10 or so planes destroyed. The airport was shelled with [[BM-21 Grad|Grad]] rockets with reports of the [[Air Traffic Control]] tower completely destroyed, including the main reception building completely wrecked. Surrounding civilian residential areas and infrastructure, of which include Bridges, Electricity equipment, water equipment, and roads were also damaged in the fighting. Oil storage tankers containing large reserves of Kerosene fuels, gases and related chemicals were burnt and large plumes of smoke rose into the air.

Reconstruction efforts are underway with the GNA giving a contract amounting to $78 million to an Italian firm 'Emaco Group' or "Aeneas Consorzio", to rebuild the destroyed facilities. All flights have been diverted to ex-military base known as [[Mitiga International Airport]] as of 2017.
