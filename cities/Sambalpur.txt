===Vajrayana Buddhism===
Although it is generally accepted that Tantric Buddhism first developed in the country of Uddiyana or Odra Desha under King Indrabhuti, there is an old and well known [[Indrabhuti#Conflation of Indrabhuti related to conflation of Oddiyana|scholarly dispute]] as to whether Uddiyana or Odra was in the Swat valley, Odisha or some other place.

[[Indrabhuti]], the oldest known king of Sambalpur, founded [[Vajrayana]], while his sister, who was married to Yuvaraja Jalendra of Lankapuri (Suvarnapur), founded Sahajayana. These new Tantric cults of [[Buddhism]] introduced the [[mantra]], [[mudra]] and [[mandala]] along with six Tantric Abhicharas (practices) such as Marana, Stambhana, Sammohana, Vidvesan, Uchchatana and Vajikarana. The Tantric Buddhist sects made efforts to raise the dignity of the lowest of the low of the society to a higher plane. It revived primitive beliefs and practices a simpler and less formal approach to the personal god, a liberal and respectful attitude towards women and denial of caste system.<ref>[http://bargarh.nic.in/tourism.htm Bargarh District] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207051612/http://bargarh.nic.in/tourism.htm |date=7 February 2011 }}. Bargarh.nic.in. Retrieved on 20 January 2011.</ref>

From the seventh century A.D. onwards, many popular religious elements of heterogeneous nature were incorporated into [[Mahayana]] Buddhism which finally resulted in the origin of Vajrayana, Kalachakrayana and Sahajayana Tantric Buddhism. Tantric Buddhism first developed in Uddiyana, a country which was divided into two kingdoms, Sambhala and Lankapuri. Sambhala has been identified with Sambalpur and Lankapuri with Subarnapura ([[Sonepur, Odisha|Sonepur]]).<ref>[https://www.scribd.com/document/152617783/Problems-in-Reconstructing-the-Social-History-of-Buddhism-in-Orissa-pdf Problems in Reconstructing The Social History of Buddhism in Orissa PDF ]</ref>
