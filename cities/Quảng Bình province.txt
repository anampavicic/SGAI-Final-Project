'''Quảng Bình''' is a southern coastal [[Provinces of Vietnam|province]] in the [[North Central Coast]] region, the [[Central Vietnam|Central]] of [[Việt Nam|Vietnam]]. It borders [[Hà Tĩnh province|Hà Tĩnh]] to the north, [[Quảng Trị province|Quảng Trị]] to the south, [[Khammouane province|Khammouane]] of [[Laos]] to the west and the [[South China Sea|East Sea]] ([[Gulf of Tonkin]]) to the east.

Quảng Bình was formerly Tiên Bình under the reign of Lê Trung Hưng of the [[Lê dynasty]] (this province was renamed Quảng Bình in 1604).<ref name="quangbinh">{{cite web|url=http://www.vietnamtourism.com/e_pages/country/province.asp?mt=8452&uid=1253|title=Provinces and cities|publisher=Vietnamtourism.com|access-date=17 June 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810214754/http://vietnamtourism.com/e_pages/country/province.asp?mt=8452&uid=1253|archive-date=10 August 2010}}</ref>
The province has an area of {{Convert|7998.76|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}<ref name="area_2022"/> and population of 913,860 inhabitants (as of 2022).<ref name="pop_2022"/> Historically, this region belonged to kingdom of [[Champa]]. Later it was claimed by both the [[Đại Việt]] and Champa and officially annexed into Đại Việt by [[Lý Thường Kiệt]], a [[Lý dynasty]] general (under the reign of [[Lý Thánh Tông]]) in 1069.

The site of present-day Quảng Bình was battlefields between Champa and Vietnam until the Vietnamese territory was expanded further south by subsequent dynasties. Quảng Bình's importance expanded after [[Nguyễn Hoàng]], a prince of [[Nguyễn lords]] was sent to the south by a king of the [[Lê dynasty]]. Hoàng built his estate and turned it into [[Đàng Trong]], a rival of the [[de facto]] [[Trịnh lords|Trịnh]]-controlled [[Đàng Ngoài]]. Quảng Bình became an important front to defend Đàng Trong from attack by Đàng Ngoài. Under [[French Indochina|French rule]], this province was part of [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], this province was part of the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] (aka North Vietnam), only 20&nbsp;km from the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]]. This province was severely devastated by bombing from U.S. [[B-52]]s. This province is home to the World Heritage [[Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park]]. The province is also home to several famous Vietnamese persons, including revered Senior General [[Võ Nguyên Giáp]], poet [[Hàn Mặc Tử]], writer [[Bảo Ninh]] and the family of former [[South Vietnam]] President [[Ngô Đình Diệm]]. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Quảng Bình province is endowed with [[biodiversity]], especially typical of [[Annamite Range|Annamites]] eco-region. According to the results of initial surveys, the primary tropical forest in [[Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng]] is home to 140 families, 427 genera, and 751 species of vascular plants, of which 36 species are considered endangered and listed in the [[Vietnam's Red Data Book]].

Seedlings can only grow in holes and cracks in the limestone where soil has accumulated, so in general regeneration after disturbance is slow. The forest type in this national park is dominated by [[evergreen]] tree species with scattered deciduous trees such as ''[[Dipterocarpus kerri]]'', ''[[Anogeissus acuminata]]'', ''[[Pometia pinnata]]'' and ''[[Lagerstroemia calyculata]]''. In Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng, the dominant plant families are the [[Lauraceae]], [[Fabaceae]], [[Theaceae]] and [[Rosaceae]], with some scattered [[gymnosperm]]s such as ''[[Podocarpus imbricatus]]'', ''[[Podocarpus neriifolius]]'', and ''[[Nageia fleuryi]]''.<ref name="eoearth">{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Phong_Nha-Ke_Bang_National_Park,_Vietnam|title=Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park, Vietnam|publisher=Eoearth.org|access-date=17 June 2010}}</ref>

==Administrative divisions==
Quảng Bình is subdivided into 8 district-level sub-divisions:

{{div col}}
* 6 districts:
** [[Bố Trạch District|Bố Trạch]]
** [[Lệ Thủy District|Lệ Thủy]]
** [[Minh Hóa District|Minh Hóa]]
** [[Quảng Ninh District|Quảng Ninh]]
** [[Quảng Trạch District|Quảng Trạch]]
** [[Tuyên Hóa District|Tuyên Hóa]]
{{div col end}}
* 1 district-level town:
** [[Ba Đồn]] (newly created since 2013)
* 1 provincial city:
** [[Đồng Hới]] (capital)

They are further subdivided into 7 commune-level towns (or townlets), 136 communes, and 16 wards.

These in turn are further subdivided into villages (''lang'' or ''thon''). Like [[politics of Vietnam|administrative system of Vietnam]], the leader of each administrative unit is the secretary of the local Communist Party Cell. Each administrative unit includes a people's council, who elects a people's committee to execute its daily affairs. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Culture and education==
[[File:HoangPhucPagoda3.jpg|thumb|[[Hoằng Phúc Pagoda]] in Mỹ Thủy]]
The province is home to [[Quảng Bình University]], a newly established university from the Normal College of Quảng Bình. This university has faculties of business administration, normal faculty and informatics faculty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quangbinhuni.edu.vn/eindex.asp|title=website of Quảng Bình University|publisher=Quảng Bình University|access-date=6 March 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309172654/http://www.quangbinhuni.edu.vn/eindex.asp|archive-date=9 March 2008}}</ref>

On 3 July 2007, an earthen pot of ancient coins weighing 20&nbsp;kg was found buried at 500&nbsp;cm underground in a paddy field and later sold for US$12.5 per kilo.

Therefore, more and more young and educated here find their ways to the big cities and more industrialized provinces. In each commune (''xã'', a rural subdivision of a district), there is a clinic and there is a hospital in every county, in Đồng Hới city, there are more. The Đồng Hới Hospital, which was donated by Cuba, was built in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cuba and Vietnam are brothers in a family|url=http://embacuba.cubaminrex.cu/Default.aspx?tabid=4602|publisher=Embajada de Cuba en Vietnam|access-date=6 March 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623020117/http://embacuba.cubaminrex.cu/Default.aspx?tabid=4602|archive-date=23 June 2007}}</ref>

==Economy==
The provincial GDP per capita is one of the lowest of Vietnam (around US$1500, compared to Vietnam's average GDP per capita of US$2385). Industries base on mainly construction material production (cement, tiles, building rock, brick) thanks to its abundance in [[limestone]] and white clay deposits. The province has two industrial parks, one in Đồng Hới city and the other in Hon La bay. Sea food processing, bio-fertilizer and aluminum production are also important to this provincial economy. Over 80% of the population live on agricultural production.

The central and the south of Vietnam (from Ngang mount pass to [[Bình Thuận province]]) was part of the [[Champa]] Kingdom. During that time, wars between Champa kingdom and Đại Việt were frequent. Majority of the wars were started by Champa Kingdom, who was then, stronger than Đại Việt. Quảng Bình became Đại Việt's territory in 1306 A.D. following the arrange marriage of the Trần Dynasty princess [[Huyền Trân]] to the Champa king, Jaya Sinhavarman III (Vietnamese: Chế Mân). Huyen Trần was King Trần Nhân Tông's daughter and King Trần Anh Tông's younger sister. Political matches made to acquire land were common traditional practices by Champa kings.
