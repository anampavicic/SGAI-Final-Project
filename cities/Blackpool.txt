'''Blackpool''' is a [[seaside town]] in [[Lancashire]], England. It is located on the [[Irish Sea]] coast of [[the Fylde]] peninsula, approximately {{convert|27|mi|km|0}} north of [[Liverpool]] and {{convert|14|mi|km|0}} west of [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]].  It is the main settlement in the [[Borough of Blackpool|borough of the same name]]. The population of Blackpool at the [[2021 United Kingdom census|2021 census]] was 141,000, a decrease of 1,100 [[2011 United Kingdom census|in ten years]].<ref name="HowLife">{{Cite web |date=19 January 2023 |title=How life has changed in Blackpool: Census 2021 |url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/censusareachanges/E06000009/ |access-date=14 November 2023}}</ref>

Blackpool was originally a small hamlet; it began to grow in the mid-eighteenth century, when sea bathing for health purposes became fashionable. Blackpool's beach was suitable for this activity, and by 1781 several hotels had been built. The opening of a railway station in the 1846 allowed more visitors to reach the resort, which continued to grow for the remainder of the nineteenth century. In 1876, the town became a borough, and by 1951 its population had reached 147,000. Blackpool's development was closely tied to the Lancashire [[cotton mill|cotton-mill]] practice of annual factory maintenance shutdowns, known as [[wakes week]]s, when many workers chose to visit the seaside. The local [[#Climate|climate]] is mild and rainy also in summer.

In the late 20th century, changing holiday preferences and increased overseas travel impacted Blackpool's standing as a leading resort. Despite economic challenges, the town's urban fabric and economy remain centred around tourism. Today, Blackpool's seafront, featuring landmarks such as [[Blackpool Tower]], [[Blackpool Illuminations|Illuminations]], [[Blackpool Pleasure Beach|Pleasure Beach]], and the [[Winter Gardens, Blackpool|Winter Gardens]], continue to draw millions of visitors annually.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lambert |first=Tim |date=2021-03-14 |title=A History of Blackpool |url=https://localhistories.org/a-history-of-blackpool/ |access-date=2023-11-12 |website=Local Histories |language=en-GB}}</ref> The town is home to football club [[Blackpool F.C.]] The team has one major trophy, winning the [[1953 FA Cup Final|1953 FA Cup]].

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Blackpool.1784.jpg|thumb|View of Blackpool, 1784|200x200px]]   
In 1970, a 13,500-year-old [[Alces alces|elk]] skeleton was found with man-made barbed bone points. Now displayed in the [[Harris Museum]] this provided the first evidence of [[human]]s living on [[the Fylde]].<ref name="amounderness">{{Cite web |title=Who were the Setantii? |url=http://www.amounderness.com/site/setantii.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330043117/http://www.amounderness.com/site/setantii.htm |archive-date=30 March 2008 |access-date=26 January 2008 |publisher=amounderness.com}}</ref> The Fylde was also home to a British tribe, the [[Setantii]] (the "dwellers in the water") a sub-tribe of the [[Brigantes]]. Some of the earliest villages on the Fylde, which were later to become part of Blackpool town, were named in the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

In [[medieval]] times Blackpool emerged as a few farmsteads on the coast within Layton-with-Warbreck, the name coming from "le pull", a stream that drained [[Marton Mere]] and Marton Moss into the sea.  The stream ran through peatlands that discoloured the water, so the name for the area became "Black Poole". In the 15th century the area was just called ''Pul'', and a 1532 map calls the area "the pole howsys alias the north howsys".{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

In 1602, entries in [[Bispham Parish Church]] baptismal register include both ''Poole'' and for the first time ''blackpoole''. The first house of any substance, Foxhall, was built by the Tyldesley family of [[Myerscough, Lancashire|Myerscough]] Lodge and existed in the latter part of the 17th century. By the end of that century it was occupied by squire and diarist [[Tyldesley Diary|Thomas Tyldesley]], grandson of the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] [[Thomas Tyldesley|Sir Thomas Tyldesley]]. An [[Act of Parliament]] in 1767 enclosed a [[Commons|common]], mostly sand hills on the coast, that stretched from Spen Dyke southwards (see [[Main Dyke]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

===Sea bathing and the growth of seaside resorts===
In the 18th century, sea bathing gained popularity for health benefits, drawing visitors to Blackpool. In 1781, The town's amenities, including hotels, archery stall, and bowling greens, slowly expanded. By 1801, the population reached 473. Henry Banks, instrumental in Blackpool's growth, purchased Lane Ends estate in 1819, building the first holiday cottages in 1837.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The seaside resort: a British cultural export, an article by John K. Walton |url=https://archives.history.ac.uk/history-in-focus/Sea/articles/walton.html#:~:text=Seaside%20resorts%20began%20to%20appear,and%20parts%20of%20Scandinavia;%20and |access-date=2024-08-29 |website=archives.history.ac.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=History of Blackpool |url=https://blackpoolcivictrust.org.uk/history.html |access-date=2024-08-29 |website=blackpoolcivictrust.org.uk}}</ref>

===Arrival of the railways===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2023}}[[File:On the sands at Blackpool 1895.jpg|thumb|right|Blackpool sands in 1895]]
In 1846, a pivotal event marked the early growth of the town: the completion of a railway branch line to Blackpool from Poulton. This spurred development as visitors flocked in by rail, boosting the town's economy. Blackpool prospered with the construction of accommodations and attractions, fostering rapid growth in the 1850s and 1860s. A Board of Health was established in 1851, gas lighting in 1852, and piped water in 1864. The town's population exceeded 2,500 by 1851.

===Electricity===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2023}}[[File:The promenade, Blackpool, Lancashire, England, ca. 1898.jpg|thumb|[[Photochrom]] of the Promenade c. 1898]]
Blackpool's growth since the 1870s was shaped by its pioneering use of electrical power. In 1879, it became the world's first municipality with electric street lighting along the promenade, setting the stage for the [[Blackpool Illuminations]].

By the 1890s, Blackpool had a population of 35,000 and could host 250,000 holidaymakers. Notable structures, like the Grand Theatre (1894) and Blackpool Tower, emerged. The Grand Theatre was among Britain's first all-electric theatres.

In 1885, it established one of the world's earliest electric tramways, initially operated by the [[Blackpool Electric Tramway Company]]. By 1899, the tramway expanded, and the conduit system was replaced by overhead wires. The system still remains in service.

===Towards the present===
[[File:Eric and Mabel Moorhouse.jpg|thumb|left|Holiday makers from Yorkshire, c1930]]
[[File:Blackpool promenade steps at high tide.jpg|thumb|Promenade steps at high tide in 2017]]
The inter-war period saw Blackpool develop and mature as a holiday destination, and by 1920 Blackpool had around eight million visitors per year, still drawn largely from the mill towns of East [[Lancashire]] and the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]].{{citation needed|date=December 2023}} Blackpool's population boom was complete by 1951, by which time some 147,000 people were living in the town – compared with 47,000 in 1901 and 14,000 in 1881.<ref>{{Cite web |title=A History of Blackpool |url=http://www.localhistories.org/blackpool.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623015207/http://www.localhistories.org/blackpool.html |archive-date=23 June 2012 |access-date=17 August 2012 |publisher=Localhistories.org}}</ref> The town continued to attract more visitors in the decade after the war, reaching a peak of 17 million per year.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

By the 1960s the UK tourism industry was undergoing radical changes. The increasing popularity of [[package holiday]]s took many of Blackpool's traditional visitors abroad. The construction of the [[M55 motorway]] in 1975 made Blackpool more feasible as a day trip rather than an overnight stay. The modern economy, however, remains relatively undiversified and firmly rooted in the tourism sector.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

=== Green belt ===
{{further|North West Green Belt}}
Blackpool is within a [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] region that extends into the wider surrounding counties and is in place to reduce [[urban sprawl]], prevent the towns in the [[Blackpool urban area]] and other nearby conurbations in Lancashire from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage [[brownfield]] reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas, and imposing stricter conditions on the permitted building.<ref name="belt">{{Cite web |title=Blackpool Local Plan 2001/2016 |url=https://www.blackpool.gov.uk/Residents/Planning-environment-and-community/Documents/Adopted-Local-Plan.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727031045/https://www.blackpool.gov.uk/Residents/Planning-environment-and-community/Documents/Adopted-Local-Plan.pdf |archive-date=27 July 2020 |access-date=23 February 2018 |website=Blackpool.gov.uk}}</ref>

==Demographics==
Blackpool's population was approximately 141,000 in 2021 according to census figures – a fall of 0.7 per cent from the [[2021 United Kingdom census|2011 census]].<ref name="HowLife" /> It is one of five North West local authority areas to have recorded a fall in this period, during which the figure for England as a whole rose by 6.6 per cent. Blackpool is the third most densely populated local authority in the North West, with 4,046 people per square kilometre, compared with 4,773 in Manchester and 4,347 in Liverpool.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web |title=Population |url=https://www.blackpooljsna.org.uk/Blackpool-Profile/Population.aspx |access-date=16 November 2023 |website=Blackpooljsna.org}}</ref>

In 2021, 41.0 per cent of Blackpool residents reported having 'No religion', up from 24.5 per cent in 2011. Across England the percentage increased from 24.8 per cent to 36.7 per cent. However, because the census question about religion was voluntary and has varying response rates, the ONS warns that 'caution is needed when comparing figures between different areas or between censuses'.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

According to the 2021 census, 49.5 per cent of residents aged 16 years and over were employed (excluding full-time students, with 3.8 per cent unemployed (a drop from 5.4 per cent in 2011). The proportion of retired residents was 23.8 per cent. Just over a tenth of people aged 16 and over worked 15 hours or less a week.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

Blackpool's population is forecast to rise slightly to 141,500 by 2044, with the 45-64-year-old group showing the greatest decrease. The number of residents over 65 years old is projected to rise to almost 36,000, making up 26 per cent of the total population.<ref name="auto" />

There is just one tier of local government covering Blackpool, being the [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority]] of [[Blackpool Council]], which is based at [[Blackpool Town Hall]] on Talbot Square.

Parts of the [[Blackpool Urban Area]] extend beyond the borough boundaries of Blackpool into the neighbouring boroughs of [[Borough of Wyre|Wyre]] (which includes [[Fleetwood]], [[Cleveleys]], [[Thornton, Lancashire|Thornton]] and [[Poulton-le-Fylde]]) and [[Borough of Fylde|Fylde]] (which covers [[Lytham St Annes]]).

===Administrative history===
Blackpool was historically part of the [[Township (England)|township]] of [[Layton, Blackpool|Layton with Warbreck]], which was part of the [[ancient parish]] of [[Bispham, Blackpool|Bispham]]. The township was constituted a [[Local Board of Health|Local Board of Health District]] in 1851, governed by a local board.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=21259|page=2869|date=4 November 1851}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Blackpool Improvement Act 1853 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Vict/16-17/29/contents/enacted |access-date=22 October 2023 |website=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=The National Archives}}</ref> In 1868 the Layton with Warbreck district was renamed the Blackpool district.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cunningham Glen |first=W. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EjFLAAAAcAAJ |title=The Law relating to Public Health and Local Government |date=1869 |publisher=Butterworths |location=London |page=746 |access-date=22 October 2023}}</ref>

In 1876 the district was elevated to become a [[municipal borough]], governed by a body formally called the "mayor, aldermen and burgesses of the borough of Blackpool", but generally known as the corporation or town council.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Farrer |first=William |url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/lancs/vol7/pp247-251#anchorn43 |title=A History of the County of Lancaster |last2=Brownbill |first2=J. |date=1912 |publisher=Victoria County History |location=London |pages=247–251 |access-date=22 October 2023}}</ref> The borough was enlarged several times, notably in 1879, when it took in parts of the neighbouring parishes of [[Marton, Blackpool|Marton]] and [[Bispham with Norbreck]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Blackpool Improvement Act 1879 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Vict/42-43/199/contents/enacted |access-date=23 October 2023 |website=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=The National Archives}}</ref> in 1918, when it absorbed the rest of Bispham with Norbreck, and in 1934, when it absorbed the rest of Marton.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Blackpool Civil Parish |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10342132#tab02 |access-date=23 October 2023 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth}}</ref>

In 1904 Blackpool was made a [[county borough]], taking over county-level functions from [[Lancashire County Council]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=November 2010 |title=Lancashire Record Office: What's in it for Blackpool? |url=https://www.lancashire.gov.uk/media/52107/Whats-in-it-for-Blackpool-Nov-2010.pdf |access-date=23 October 2023 |website=Lancashire County Council}}</ref> This was reverted in 1974 when Blackpool became a lower-tier [[non-metropolitan district]] with the county council once more providing services in the town.<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=si|si=The English Non-metropolitan Districts (Definition) Order 1972|year=1972|number=2039|access-date=23 October 2023}}</ref> Blackpool regained its independence from the county council in 1998 when it was made a unitary authority.<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=si|si=The Lancashire (Boroughs of Blackburn and Blackpool) (Structural Change) Order 1996|year=1996|number=1868|access-date=23 October 2023}}</ref>

Blackpool remains part of the [[ceremonial county]] of Lancashire for the purposes of [[Lieutenancy area|lieutenancy]].<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=act|act=Lieutenancies Act 1997|year=1997|chapter=23|access-date=23 October 2023}}</ref>

===Parliamentary constituencies===
Blackpool is covered by two [[Uk parliament|Westminster constituencies]]: 
* [[Blackpool North and Fleetwood (UK Parliament constituency)|Blackpool North and Fleetwood]] 
* [[Blackpool South (UK Parliament constituency)|Blackpool South]]
Until 1945, the area was represented by just one constituency, named [[Blackpool (UK Parliament constituency)|Blackpool]]. This was replaced by the new Blackpool North and Blackpool South constituencies. Blackpool North became Blackpool North and Cleveleys for the 2010 general election, when Conservative [[Paul Maynard]] became MP. Another Conservative, [[Scott Benton (politician)|Scott Benton]], won Blackpool South from longstanding Labour MP [[Gordon Marsden]] in 2019. Benton resigned on 25 March 2024, however, after the [[Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards]] investigated a fake lobbying role he was offered by undercover reporters from ''[[The Times]]''.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2023-04-05 |title=Scott Benton suspended as Tory MP after lobbying sting |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-65193097 |access-date=2023-10-02 |work=BBC News |language=en-GB}}</ref>

The constituencies were reorganised for the 2024 general election, following recommendations from the [[Boundary commissions (United Kingdom)|Boundary Commission]] for England that aim to make the number of voters in the country's seats more equal.<ref>{{Cite web |title=2023 Review {{!}} Boundary Commission for England |url=https://boundarycommissionforengland.independent.gov.uk/2023-review/ |access-date=2023-10-02 |website=boundarycommissionforengland.independent.gov.uk}}</ref>  Blackpool South was expanded to take in new wards near the north of the constituency. The Blackpool North and Cleveleys constituency incorporated Fleetwood and five wards from the Blackpool Council area, and was renamed Blackpool North and Fleetwood – as a similar seat was known between 1997 and 2010. In 2022 Maynard told the ''[[Blackpool Gazette]]'': "I am sure that residents of Fleetwood will be glad to be reunited with the rest of the Fylde coast, as they are geographically."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Faulkner |first=Paul |date=8 Nov 2022 |title=Boundary review: this is what the latest constituency proposals mean for Blackpool, Wyre and Fylde |url=https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/news/politics/boundary-review-this-is-what-the-latest-constituency-proposals-mean-for-blackpool-wyre-and-fylde-3910958 |website=Blackpool Gazette}}</ref>

==Economy==
As a local authority area, Blackpool's gross domestic product (GDP) was approximately £3.2 billion in 2020 – 0.2 per cent of the English economy. GDP fell by 2.2 per cent between 2019 and 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Blackpool Economy {{!}} Labour Market & Industries |url=https://www.varbes.com/economy/blackpool-economy |access-date=2023-11-10 |website=Varbes |language=en-gb}}</ref>

Seventy-five per cent of people of working age in Blackpool were economically active in 2021, with 51,600 in full-time employment and 7,900 self-employed. The average for the North West is 72.9 per cent and for England is 74.8 per cent.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Employment |url=https://www.blackpooljsna.org.uk/People-and-Places/Wider-determinants-of-health/Employment.aspx |access-date=16 November 2023 |website=Blackpooljsna.org}}</ref>

Twenty-five per cent of jobs were in human health and social work – compared with 13.6 per cent nationally. Reflecting Blackpool's strong tourism industry, 10.9 per cent were in accommodation and food services. With aerospace company [[BAE Systems|BAE]] situated in the wider area and the [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Civil Service]] one of its major employers, the proportion of people working in public administration, defence and compulsory social security is also higher than the national average – 12.5 per cent compared with 4.6 per cent.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Business Register and Employment Survey - Office for National Statistics |url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/surveys/informationforbusinesses/businesssurveys/businessregisterandemploymentsurvey |access-date=2023-11-10 |website=Ons.gov.uk}}</ref>

In a survey of the UK's 63 largest cities and towns – using primary urban areas, a measure of the built-up area rather than local authority boundaries – the think tank [[Centre for Cities]] said Blackpool's gross value added (GVA) was £5.2 billion in 2020, with GVA per hour of £32.7. That placed it at 53rd and 40th place in the survey respectively. It was also in the lower half of the rankings for business start-ups, closures and overall stock, as well as the proportion of new economy firms.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Blackpool |url=https://www.centreforcities.org/city/blackpool/ |access-date=2023-11-10 |website=Centre for Cities |language=en-US}}</ref>

Blackpool is the third lowest local authority area in the UK for gross median weekly pay. Its growth rates were forecast to be among the lowest localities in the UK Competitiveness Index 2023 - along with [[Blaenau Gwent]] (Wales), [[Burnley]] (North West), [[Torbay]] (South West), and [[Merthyr Tydfil]] (Wales).<ref>{{Cite web |title=UK Competitiveness Index 2023 |url=http://cforic.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/UKCI-2023.pdf}}</ref>

Blackpool is also the main centre of the wider Fylde Coast sub-regional economy, containing other coastal towns, including [[Lytham St Annes|Lytham]], market towns, an agricultural hinterland and some industry.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Local Economy Baseline for Blackpool |url=https://www.blackpool.gov.uk/Residents/Planning-environment-and-community/Documents/EB016-Blackpool-Local-Economy-Baseline-Study-2011.pdf |access-date=16 November 2023 |website=Blackpool.gov.uk}}</ref> Polymers company [[Victrex]], in Thornton and formerly part of [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]], is one of the major private sector companies headquartered in the area. Sports car manufacturer [[TVR]] was based in Blackpool until 2006, and national jewellery chain [[Beaverbrooks]], founded in 1919, relocated its head office to St Annes in 1946.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

Economic development officials highlight Blackpool's role in industry sectors including aerospace and advanced engineering, advanced materials technologies, regional energy, and food manufacturing. As well as BAE, leading aerospace companies in the area include [[Magellan Aerospace]] and Force Technology. In advanced materials, AGC and Victrex are significant companies. In energy, nuclear fuel manufacturer [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]], the [[National Nuclear Laboratory]] and offshore energy companies [[Ørsted (company)|Orsted]], NVH and Helispeed all have operations in the area. Blackpool's travel to work area has 2.5 times the Great Britain-average concentration of food manufacturing workers.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Key Sectors |url=https://businessinblackpool.com/key-sectors/ |access-date=2023-11-10 |website=Blackpool |language=en-GB}}</ref>

=== Conferences and exhibitions ===
During the second half of the 20th century and up to 2007, Blackpool was one of the country's leading locations for political conferences, with the three main parties as well as bodies such as the TUC holding events at the [[Winter Gardens, Blackpool|Winter Gardens]].

With the Winter Gardens in need of refurbishment and parties preferring inland city locations to coastal resorts, Blackpool held no major political conferences between 2008 and 2021.   The Conservatives returned for their spring event in 2022 in the newly rebuilt Winter Gardens Conference and Exhibition Centre.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hodgson |first=Sarah |last2=Beardsworth |first2=Luke |last3=O'Neill |first3=Kara |last4=Barre |first4=Claire |date=2022-03-19 |title=Boris in Blackpool as Conservative Party Spring Conference day two gets underway |url=https://www.lancs.live/news/lancashire-news/conservative-party-spring-conference-lands-23427249 |access-date=2023-10-02 |website=LancsLive |language=en}}</ref>

==Regeneration==
Like most UK coastal resorts, Blackpool declined from the 1960s onwards with the rise of overseas holidays.   This coincided with a lack of investment in the town and its facilities for both residents and tourists.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Glancey |first=Jonathan |date=10 June 2015 |title=Britain's seaside ruins |url=https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20150609-britains-seaside-ruins |website=bbc.com}}</ref>

Fulfilment of a 1965 masterplan to remodel the town centre was "limited and piecemeal", according to Historic England.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Barnes |first=Samantha |date=August 2009 |title=Historic Townscape Characterisation Assessment |url=https://www.blackpool.gov.uk/Residents/Planning-environment-and-community/Documents/TOWN-CENTRE-Historic-Townscape-Characterisation-Assessment-August-2009.pdf |website=blackpool.gov.uk}}</ref> Ambitious plans to redevelop the centre "stuttered to a halt in the early 1970s". Large numbers of homes were deemed unfit for human habitation and by 1993, almost 30 per cent of households did not have central heating, compared with the national average of 8.5 per cent. A new masterplan in 2003 was a response to this decline and the growing threat from coastal erosion. It was described by English Heritage as a "bold attempt to ensure the future of the town".

Blackpool had pinned its regeneration hopes on an Atlantic City– or Las Vegas–style resort casino that Leisure Parcs, then owner of Blackpool Tower and the Winter Gardens, unveiled £1&nbsp;billion plans for in 2002.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Thame |first=David |date=May 2002 |title=Viva Blackpool |work=North West Business Insider}}</ref> By 2007, Blackpool and Greenwich in London were considered frontrunners among the seven bidders for Britain's first and only [[Regional casino|supercasino]] licence;<ref>{{Cite web |last=Harrison |first=Ben |date=15 February 2007 |title=Casinos and Regeneration: The story so far |url=https://www.ippr.org/files/images/media/files/publication/2011/05/Casinos_and_Regeneration_briefing_note_1564.pdf |website=ippr.org}}</ref> however, nearby Manchester won the bidding process. The Casino Advisory Panel ruled that the "regeneration benefits of the supercasino for Blackpool are unproven and more limited geographically than other proposals". The government later abandoned the supercasino licence altogether following a legislative defeat in the [[House of Lords]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mulholland |first=Hélène |date=28 March 2007 |title=Casino plans in disarray after shock Lords defeat |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/mar/28/immigrationpolicy.gambling |website=guardian.com}}</ref>
[[File:Blackpool Promenade - geograph.org.uk - 4713799.jpg|thumb|Blackpool's revamped promenade]]

In response to Blackpool losing the supercasio bid and lobbying from the town's disappointed leaders, ministers increased its regeneration spending,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jones |first=Marc |date=26 February 2008 |title=UK government kills off supercasino plan |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-supercasino-idINL2610039620080226 |website=reuters.com}}</ref> coordinated by an [[Urban Regeneration Company]] ReBlackpool, set up in 2005.<ref>{{Cite web |date=4 February 2005 |title=Urban regeneration companies formally launched |url=https://www.planningresource.co.uk/article/460796/urban-regeneration-companies-formally-launched |website=planningresource.co.uk}}</ref> Before being wound up in 2010, ReBlackpool led on Central Seafront, a £73&nbsp;million coastal protection scheme that brought new promenades and seawalls for the town, funded by Government, the North West Development Agency and the European Regional Development Fund.<ref>{{Cite web |date=18 July 2008 |title=Blackpool opens first promenades along £73m coastal defence |url=https://www.placenorthwest.co.uk/blackpool-opens-first-promenades-along-73m-coastal-defence/ |website=placenorthwest.co.uk}}</ref> ReBlackpool also prepared the Talbot Gateway scheme, appointing Muse Developments to develop 160,000 sq m of office and business space, as well as retail and hotel units, on a 10ha plot near [[Blackpool North railway station|Blackpool North Station]]. Blackpool Council agreed to relocate its offices to the development and there were plans for a new public transport interchange.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hoyle |first=Rhiannon |date=17 March 2009 |title=Morgan Sindall signs £220m Blackpool redevelopment |url=https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/sections/news/morgan-sindall-signs-220m-blackpool-redevelopment-17-03-2009/ |website=constructionnews.co.uk}}</ref>

In 2010, Blackpool Council bought landmarks [[Blackpool Tower]], the [[Winter Gardens, Blackpool|Winter Gardens]] and the Golden Mile Centre from leisure entrepreneur [[Trevor Hemmings]], aiming to refurbish them in a "last-ditch effort to arrest Blackpool's economic decline".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Council buys Blackpool Tower to stem slide {{!}} Financial Times |url=https://www.ft.com/content/767a2b14-3bef-11df-9412-00144feabdc0 |access-date=2023-09-18 |website=Ft.com}}</ref> Public ownership enabled significant further investment in the facilities.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Parkinson |first=Shelagh |date=1 April 2020 |title=Ten years since 'bold' buyout of Blackpool Tower and Winter Gardens |url=https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/news/politics/ten-years-since-bold-buyout-of-blackpool-tower-and-winter-gardens-2525212 |website=blackpoolgazette.co.uk}}</ref> The restoration of the Tower's stained glass windows was carried out by local specialist Aaron Whiteside, who was given a Blackpool Council conservation award for the work.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Blackpool Civic Trust Awards 2014 |url=https://blackpoolcivictrust.org.uk/Civic-Trust-Award-2014.html |access-date=16 November 2023 |website=Blackpoolcivictrust.org.uk}}</ref>

Refurbishment of the Winter Gardens conference centre was completed in time to host the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] spring conference in 2022, with further work announced in 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Herbert |first=Lucinda |date=12 February 2022 |title=Work has finished on Blackpool's £30m Winter Gardens conference centre |url=https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/business/work-has-finished-on-blackpools-ps30m-winter-gardens-conference-centre-3565319 |website=blackpoolgazette.co.uk}}</ref>

Blackpool Council was one of four local authorities in the Blackpool Fylde and Wyre Economic Development Company – the others being [[Lancashire County Council]], [[Lancashire County Council|Fylde Borough Council]] and [[Borough of Wyre|Wyre Borough Council]]. It oversaw the development of the [[Blackpool Airport]] Development Zone, which came into existence in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Blackpool's Enterprise Zone goes live |url=https://www.lancashirebusinessview.co.uk/latest-news-and-features/blackpool-s-enterprise-zone-goes-live |access-date=2023-09-18 |website=Lancashire Business View |language=en}}</ref> It offers tax breaks and simplified planning to employers.

Blackpool Council, once again owner of the airport since it acquired it from Balfour Beatty in 2017, is seeking outline planning consent to build five new hangars and a commercial unit. The masterplan for the Blackpool Airport Enterprise Zone then envisages a new digital and technology quarter called Silicon Sands.<ref>{{Cite web |title=New era for Blackpool Airport as council takes control |url=https://www.lancashirebusinessview.co.uk/latest-news-and-features/new-era-for-blackpool-airport-as-council-takes-control |access-date=2023-09-26 |website=Lancashire Business View |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Earnshaw |first=Tom |date=2023-09-25 |title=Blackpool Airport plots its first new development in 15 years |url=https://www.lancs.live/news/lancashire-news/blackpool-airport-plots-first-new-27783082 |access-date=2023-09-26 |website=LancsLive |language=en}}</ref>

In 2018, Blackpool Council announced plans for the 7-acre Blackpool Central development, on the site of [[Blackpool Central railway station|Blackpool Central Station]], which was closed in 1964. The council agreed to provide the land for the scheme – which had earlier been earmarked for the supercasino – but it was to be private-sector funded, led by developer Nikal.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2018-12-07 |title=Blackpool Golden Mile to become 'world class', council claims |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lancashire-46476635 |access-date=2023-09-18 |work=BBC News |language=en-GB}}</ref> It aims to provide a new public square, hotels, restaurants, a food market and car park.<ref name="Rabbit">{{Cite web |last=Rabbit |first=Jane |date=2023-08-10 |title=Developing Blackpool Central • Live Blackpool |url=https://www.liveblackpool.info/about/blackpool-central/developing-blackpool-central/ |access-date=2023-09-18 |website=Blackpool |language=en-GB}}</ref>

===Talbot Gateway===
[[File:Talbot Gateway Construction Work - geograph.org.uk - 3464134.jpg|thumb|Talbot Gateway Construction Work]]
The first phase of Talbot Gateway was completed in 2014 with the opening of the Number One Bickerstaffe Square council office, a supermarket and a refurbished multi-storey car park, and public spaces.<ref>{{Cite web |date=25 August 2023 |title=Talbot Gateway is a major mixed-use regeneration scheme, transforming the heart of Blackpool town centre |url=https://www.blackpool.gov.uk/Your-Council/Creating-a-better-Blackpool/Talbot-Gateway.aspx |website=blackpool.gov.uk}}</ref>

Phase two, including a new Holiday Inn and a tram terminal for the extended tramway between North Pier and North Station, began in 2021 and was due to be completed by 2022 but has been delayed, with completion now expected in 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Parkinson |first=Shelagh |date=2023-06-13 |title=Blackpool's £34m Holiday Inn plagued by yet more delays |url=https://www.lancs.live/whats-on/whats-on-news/blackpools-34m-holiday-inn-plagued-27106034 |access-date=2023-09-18 |website=LancsLive |language=en}}</ref> But new ground floor retail units were released in July 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |title=New retail units available at Talbot Gateway scheme |url=https://www.lancashirebusinessview.co.uk/latest-news-and-features/new-retail-units-available-at-talbot-gateway-scheme |access-date=2023-09-18 |website=Lancashire Business View |language=en}}</ref>

Construction started in February 2023 on new government offices as part of phase three of Talbot Gateway, and 3,000 [[Department for Work and Pensions]] staff are due to be relocated to the town after an expected completion date of March 2025.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rabbit |first=Jane |date=2023-07-21 |title=£100m DWP Office Block – Phase 3 of Talbot Gateway • Blackpool |url=https://www.liveblackpool.info/about/town-centre/100m-office-block-phase-3-of-talbot-gateway/ |access-date=2023-09-18 |website=Blackpool |language=en-GB}}</ref>

In January 2023, Blackpool and Wyre councils were awarded £40&nbsp;million from the government's Levelling-Up Fund for a new education campus as part of phase four of Talbot Gateway. The campus will provide a new carbon-neutral base for [[Blackpool and The Fylde College]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Adam |first=Nicola |date=19 January 2023 |title=Levelling Up Fund: Blackpool succeeds in £40m bid for new university, but hotel and transport plans rejected |url=https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/education/levelling-up-fund-blackpool-succeeds-in-ps40m-bid-for-new-university-but-hotel-and-transport-plans-rejected-3992567 |website=blackpoolgazette.co.uk}}</ref> This will involve "relocating" the existing Park Road campus which is considered to present challenges including dated infrastructure.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rabbit |first=Jane |date=2023-07-28 |title=New Blackpool 'Multiversity' Phase 4 of Talbot Gateway • Live Blackpool |url=https://www.liveblackpool.info/about/town-centre/blackpool-multiversity/ |access-date=2023-09-18 |website=Blackpool |language=en-GB}}</ref> The future of the 1937 building on Palatine Road – designed by civic architect JC Robinson for Blackpool Technical College and School of Art – is unknown.

===Blackpool Central===
Plans for Blackpool Central's multi-storey car park and Heritage Quarter were approved in October 2021, and construction of the car park began in 2022.<ref name="Rabbit" /> But the £300&nbsp;million development was stalled because of a lack of funding to move the Magistrates and County Courts from the site. In November 2022, Levelling-Up Secretary [[Michael Gove]] said his department would award £40&nbsp;million of funding to enable that relocation and "revitalise this great town by delivering much-needed homes, more jobs and new opportunities for local people".<ref>{{Cite web |date=11 November 2022 |title=£300m Blackpool Central regeneration project announced by DLUHC |url=https://www.pbctoday.co.uk/news/planning-construction-news/300m-blackpool-central-regeneration-project-announced-dluhc/118282/ |website=pbctoday.co.uk}}</ref>

===Heritage Action Zone===
The Blackpool Heritage Action Zone (HAZ) aims to bring new uses to the town centre by restoring buildings and promoting creative activities. Blackpool is one of more than 60 locations in the UK to have Heritage Action Zones, and its initial funding of £532,575 was secured in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Parkinson |first=Shelagh |date=2021-04-25 |title=Work to transform and renovate Blackpool Winter Gardens begins |url=https://www.lancs.live/news/lancashire-news/work-transform-renovate-blackpool-winter-20457231 |access-date=2023-09-18 |website=LancsLive |language=en}}</ref>

Restoration of buildings is taking place on Topping Street, Edward Street and Deansgate, while the largest part of the scheme is the Church Street frontage of the Winter Gardens. The Art Deco building of 28 Topping Street has become a community creative hub run by Aunty Social, a voluntary arts organisation focussing on socially engaged work in gentle spaces and directed by Catherine Mugonyi<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-09-18 |title=Water liberally: A care guide for self-cultivating culture |url=https://www.blackpoolsocial.club/40524-water-liberally/ |access-date=2023-09-18 |website=Blackpool Social Club |language=en-US}}</ref> and a building on Edward Street is to be converted into live/work for local artists and creatives.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Parkinson |first=Shelagh |date=2022-12-02 |title=Blackpool high street transformation helped by £1m cash boost |url=https://www.lancs.live/whats-on/whats-on-news/blackpool-high-street-transformation-helped-25647787 |access-date=2023-09-18 |website=LancsLive |language=en}}</ref>

The retail side of the market – located via the Abingdon Street entrance – is due to open in Winter 2023. The market was purchased by the council with £3.6&nbsp;million of government funding through the Getting Building Fund. Renovations were funded with further government money – £315,000 from the UK Shared Prosperity Fund and £90,000 from the HAZ. The market is operated by Little Blackpool Leisure which comprises Blackpool-born directors Andrew Shields and James Lucas, and locally based Jake Whittington.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-03-13 |title=Operator for resort's town centre market unveiled following renovation {{!}} TheBusinessDesk.com |url=https://www.thebusinessdesk.com/northwest/news/2111542-operator-for-resorts-town-centre-market-unveiled-following-renovation |access-date=2023-09-18 |website=North West |language=en}}</ref>

==Tourism==
Blackpool's development as a [[Resort|tourist resort]] began in the second quarter of the 18th century when [[sea bathing]] started to become popular. By 1788, there were about 50 houses on the sea bank. Of these around six  accommodated wealthy visitors while a number of other private dwellings lodged the "inferior class whose sole motive for visiting this airy region was health".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hutton |first=William |title=A Description of Blackpool in Lancashire Frequented for Sea Bathing |publisher=Peneverdant Publishing |year=1996 |isbn=0952491508 |edition=Fifth |pages=5}}</ref>  By the early 19th century, small purpose-built facilities began catering for a [[Middle class|middle-class]] market, although substantial numbers of working people from manufacturing towns were "being drawn to Blackpool's charms".<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |date=2014 |title=Blackpool's Seaside Heritage |url=https://historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/blackpools-seaside-heritage/blackpools-seaside-heritage/ |work=English Heritage}}</ref> The arrival of the railway in 1846 was the beginning of mass tourism for the town.

[[File:The_North_Pier_Blackpool_England.jpg|thumb|Blackpool's North Pier]]
North Pier opened in 1863, designed by [[Eugenius Birch]] for Blackpool's "better classes", and always retained its unique qualities of being a quieter, more reflective place compared with Blackpool's other two piers.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gregson |first=Juliette |date=2023-05-21 |title=Memories of 160 years of North Pier |url=https://www.blackpoolsocial.club/38213-memories-of-160-years-of-north-pier/ |access-date=2023-09-22 |website=Blackpool Social Club |language=en-US}}</ref> The following half century included the construction of two further piers – South Pier (now [[Central Pier, Blackpool|Central Pier]]) in 1868 and [[South Pier, Blackpool|Victoria (now South Pier)]] in 1893 – the [[Winter Gardens, Blackpool|Winter Gardens]] (1878), [[Blackpool Tower]] (1894) and the earliest surviving rides at [[Blackpool Pleasure Beach]] (founded in 1896).

Blackpool's Royal Palace Gardens at Raikes Hall was a world-famous destination for variety and [[music hall]] stars from the mid-18th century. It boasted a Grand Opera House, Indian Room for theatrical and variety performances, a Niagara café with [[cyclorama]], a skating rink and fern house, an elaborate [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]], monkey house, [[aviary]] and outside dancing platform for several thousand people. The gardens also had carriage drives and walkways with Grecian and Roman statues for promenaders to enjoy. There was also a [[boating lake]] and a racing track with [[grandstand]] for several thousand. More than 40,000 visitors passed through its gates during the opening week in 1872.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Slattery-Christy |first=David |title=Royal Palace Gardens: Blackpool's Lost Victorian Pleasure Gardens |publisher=CreateSpace |year=2016 |isbn=978-1530154913}}</ref>

[[Working class|Working-class]] tourists dominated the heart of the resort, which was the go-to destination for workers from the industrial north and their families. Entire towns would close down their industries during [[Wakes week]]s between June to September, with a different town on holiday each week. Communities would travel to Blackpool together, first by [[charabanc]] and later by train.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2013-07-17 |title=Wakes Weeks highlight of year |url=https://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/bygones/10554380.wakes-weeks-highlight-year/ |access-date=2023-09-22 |website=Lancashire Telegraph |language=en}}</ref> But Blackpool still catered for a "significant middle-class market during the spring and autumn" favouring the residential area of North Shore.<ref name=":0" />

Electric lighting came to Blackpool in 1879 and 100,000 people congregated to see the promenade illuminated on the evening of 19 September. In May 1912 [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise]] officially opened a new section of North Promenade – Princess Parade – and lights were erected to mark the occasion.<ref name=":2" /> The [[First World War]] called a temporary halt to the display in 1914 but by 1925 the lights were back with giant animated tableaux being added and extending the [[Blackpool Illuminations]] to almost six miles from Squires Gate to Red Bank Road.
[[File:Blackpool_Golden_Mile_postcard_1972.jpg|thumb|The Golden Mile in 1972]]
In 1897, [[Borough of Blackpool|Blackpool Corporation]] prohibited "[[Phrenology|phrenologists]], "[[Quackery|quack]]" doctors, [[Palmistry|palmists]], mock auctions and cheap jacks" hawking on Blackpool sands. The outliers moved onto Central Promenade where they erected stalls in front gardens.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Blackpool was Britain's most popular resort, which [[JB Priestley]] referred to as "the great, roaring, spangled beast".<ref name=":0" /> It provided visitors with entertainment and accommodation on an industrial scale. At its height it hosted more than 10 million visitors a year and its entertainment venues could seat more than 60,000 people.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

Blackpool remained a popular resort through much of the 20th century and, in contrast to most resorts, increased in size during [[World War II]] – remaining open while others closed and with many civil servants and military personnel sent to live and work there.<ref name=":0" />

Many seaside resorts fell from grace during the latter half of the 20th century as mobility, wealth, visitor aspirations and competition were in a state of flux, but Blackpool managed to retain its popular/working-class appeal as the "Las Vegas of the North".<ref>{{Cite thesis |last=Jarratt |first=David |date=July 2013 |title=A socio-cultural analysis of the traditional seaside resort and its contemporary meaning to tourists with specific reference to Morecambe, U.K. |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/19576163.pdf |publisher=University of Central Lancashire}}</ref>

==== Left Coast ====
{{Overly detailed|section|nosplit=1|details=|date=November 2023}}
Left Coast is an arts organisation that was established in 2013, as part of the UK Creative People and Places Programme. It aims to produce socially-engaged creative and cultural activities in Blackpool and Wyre.<ref name=":02">{{Cite web |title=Left Coast Real Estates: An independent evaluation based on findings by UCLAN and Ruth Melville Associates |url=https://www.tnlcommunityfund.org.uk/media/insights/documents/Real-Estates-LeftCoast-Report-Year-2-Final.pdf |website=tnlcommunityfund.org.uk}}</ref>

Left Coast projects have included the National Community Lottery funded ''Real Estates'' programme which aimed to "decrease social isolation and increase personal and community agency through the development of collaborative arts-based activities in three residential areas of Blackpool and Fleetwood".<ref name=":02" /> Artists were given residencies on local [[housing association]] estates to test whether they could become embedded in the community rather than being seen as visitors. An independent evaluation based on findings by UCLan stated that the project "made a real difference to local communities through the use of arts as a catalyst for the development of a sense of confidence and self-worth, developing or rediscovering skills, and increasing social connections."<ref name=":02" />

Following the publication of a ''[[Financial Times]]'' article ''Left Behind: Can anyone save the towns the economy forgot?''<ref>{{Cite news |date=2017-11-16 |title=Left behind: can anyone save the towns the UK economy forgot? |url=https://www.ft.com/blackpool |access-date=2023-10-14 |language=en-GB}}</ref> in 2017, Left Coast commissioned a series of artists to respond to the article with the intention of providing "a nuanced and thoughtful counter position". Photographer [[Craig Easton (photographer)|Craig Easton]] photographed the Williams family who he had first met in 1992 for a commission by French newspaper [[Libération]] to document the British 'underclass'. His images of the Williams's "came to symbolise the deprivation that was a legacy of the Conservative government of the day". Revisiting them for Left Coast, Easton created a project entitled ''Thatcher's Children''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Charlesworth |first=Antonia |date=2023-04-26 |title=Craig Easton: A lens on poverty |url=https://www.blackpoolsocial.club/37412-exhibition-craig-easton-is-anybody-listening/ |access-date=2023-10-14 |website=Blackpool Social Club |language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2022, Left Coast opened Wash Your Words: Langdale Library & Laundry Room on [[Public housing in the United Kingdom|social housing]] estate Mereside. It was designed by Lee Ivett and Ecaterina Stefanescu following conversations with the community about their needs. It provides somewhere for people to wash clothes, read, learn and create art and cost £30,000 to renovate. In January 2023 it was nominated for the [[RIBA Journal]] MacEwen Award, celebrating architecture for the common good. Judges praised it for a "joyful design [that] raises expectations of the quality of architecture people should demand of social housing estates, changing the conversation from what people don't have, to what community asset models should look like from a social, economic and environmental perspective".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kucharek |first=Jan-Carlos |date=2023-01-12 |title=MacEwen 2023 shortlist: Wash Your Words, Blackpool |url=https://www.ribaj.com/buildings/macewen-2023-shortlist-wash-your-words-blackpool-lee-ivett-ecaterina-stefanescu-laundry-library |access-date=2023-10-14 |website=Ribaj.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Blackpool library and laundry room Wash Your Words shortlisted for RIBA Journal MacEwen Award for socially engaged architecture |url=https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/education/blackpool-library-and-laundry-room-wash-your-words-shortlisted-for-riba-journal-macewen-award-for-socially-engaged-architecture-3992245 |website=Blackpool Gazette}}</ref>

==== Dance ====
[[File:Empress Ballroom Winter Gardens Blackpool.jpg|thumb|Blackpool Empress Ballroom, built in 1896]]
Dance has been central to Blackpool culture for 150 years. One of the first places visitors could dance was on the open air on the piers and its popularity led to ballrooms opening across the town. [[Blackpool Tower|The Tower Ballroom]] came first in 1894, quickly followed by the [[Empress Ballroom]] and the Alhambra.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web |title=Novelty dances in Blackpool |url=https://www.showtownblackpool.co.uk/novelty-dances-in-blackpool |access-date=2023-11-12 |website=Showtown |language=en-GB}}</ref>

The original Tower Ballroom was a smaller pavilion but the facility posed a threat to the [[Winter Gardens, Blackpool|Winter Gardens]] whose management responded in 1896 by improving its facilities. The Empress Ballroom – much grander and larger than its rival – was built on the site of a roller rink and designed by Mangnall and Littlewood with a capacity of 3,000.<ref name=":0" /> Towards the end of the [[World War I|First World War]], in 1918, the Empress Ballroom was taken over by the [[Admiralty (United Kingdom)|Admiralty]] as a space to assemble Gas Envelopes for their R33 Airship. Renovations in 1934 included a new sprung dance floor with 10,000 strips of oak, mahogany, walnut, and greenwood, on top of 1,320 four inch springs, covering 12,500 foot.

The first [[Blackpool Dance Festival]] was held in the Empress Ballroom during Easter week in 1920. The idea is credited to either Harry Wood, the musical director of the Winter Gardens, or Nelson Sharples, a music publisher in Blackpool.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web |title=History |url=https://www.blackpooldancefestival.com/history |access-date=2023-11-12 |website=Blackpool Dance Fest |language=en}}</ref> The festival was devoted to three competitions to find three new [[sequence dance]]s in three tempos – [[waltz]], [[Two-step (dance move)|two step]] and [[foxtrot]]. There was one competition per day and, on the fourth, one dance was chosen as the winner. In 1931 the dance festival hosted the inaugural British Professional and Amateur Ballroom Championships and in 1953 the competitions included the North of England Amateur and Professional Championships, a Ballroom Formation Dancing Competition, the British Amateur and Professional Ballroom Championships, plus a Professional Exhibition Dancing Competition. In 1961, a British Amateur Latin American Tournament was held, followed by a Professional event in 1962. These two events were upgraded to Championship status in 1964. 1968 saw the introduction of the Professional Invitation Team Match and in 1975 the first British Closed Dance Festival was held – now the British National Championships. In modern times around 50 countries are represented across eight annual festivals in the Empress Ballroom and Blackpool Dance Festival is considered ‘the world's first and foremost festival of dancing’.<ref name=":6" />
[[File:Blackpool Tower Ballroom 2 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Blackpool Tower Ballroom, designed by Frank Matcham, opened in 1899]]
The present Tower Ballroom was designed by [[Frank Matcham]] and opened in 1899 to rival the Empress Ballroom, matching its capacity of 3,000. Its sprung dance floor measures 120 feet by 102 feet and consists of 30,602 separate blocks of mahogany, oak and walnut. The inscription above the Ballroom stage, 'Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear', is from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s Venus and Adonis [[sonnet]]. Among the Ballroom's one-time strict rules were 'gentlemen may not dance unless with a lady' and 'disorderly conduct means immediate expulsion'. Originally, dancing was not permitted on Sundays when an evening of sacred music was performed instead. In December 1956, the ballroom was badly damaged by fire and the dance floor was destroyed. It took two years and £500,000 to restore.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of The Blackpool Tower Ballroom |url=https://www.theblackpooltower.com/history/the-ballroom/ |access-date=2023-11-12 |website=The Blackpool Tower |language=en-GB}}</ref> The [[BBC]] series [[Come Dancing]] – aired between 1950 and 1998 – was broadcast from the Tower Ballroom and featured professional dancers competing against each other.

During the 20th century, ballroom bandleaders created new novelty dances including The Blackpool Walk, the dance craze of the 1938 summer season. The music was composed by [[Lawrence Wright (composer)|Lawrence Wright]], a prominent music publisher, under the pen name Horatio Nicholls, and choreographed by 1937 Blackpool Dance Festival Champions, Cyril Farmer and Adela Roscoe. Inspired by the Blackpool Walk, in 2020 local dance company House of Wingz created a new social dance, The Blackpool Way, as part of a community project called Get Dancing. Music was composed by Callum Harvey and dance steps and moves were submitted by people from across the world.<ref name=":5" />

Based on Back Reeds Road, House of Wingz was founded by married couple Samantha and Aishley Docherty Bell. Using knowledge and education in hip hop culture, the company aims to create a legacy or 'scene' for dance artists and musicians in Blackpool, who will contribute to a growing cultural landscape in the town.<ref>{{Cite web |title=In the Spotlight with House of Wingz |url=https://www.showtownblackpool.co.uk/in-the-spotlight-with-house-of-wingz |access-date=2023-11-12 |website=Showtown |language=en-GB}}</ref> House of Wingz is the Blackpool partner for [[Breakin' Convention]], a festival celebrating the best in UK hip hop talent founded by pioneer Jonzi D.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Charlesworth |first=Antonia |date=2023-05-07 |title=Jonzi D: Hip hop can empower children in poverty |url=https://www.blackpoolsocial.club/38033-jonzi-d-how-hip-hop-can-empower-children-in-poverty/ |access-date=2023-11-12 |website=Blackpool Social Club |language=en-US}}</ref> In 2022 members of House of Wingz collected seven trophies in the UDO World Street Dance Championships including two first place prizes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Blackpool teens win top street dance trophies on their own doorstep |url=https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/education/from-after-school-dance-club-to-world-champions-blackpool-teens-win-top-street-dance-trophies-on-their-own-doorstep-3808333 |website=Blackpool Gazette}}</ref> Although dance is at the heart of House of Wingz, it is also home to a collective of musicians, artists and performers who stage their own productions and collaborate on creative projects.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Charlesworth |first=Antonia |date=2020-10-20 |title=Taking Flight - Blackpool Grime and House of Wingz |url=https://www.blackpoolsocial.club/30370-taking-flight-blackpool-grime/ |access-date=2023-11-12 |website=Blackpool Social Club |language=en-US}}</ref> Skool of Street is House of Wingz' charitable arm, providing free access to classes for children who do not have the means to pay as well as delivering the Government's Holiday Activities and Food programme.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Holiday activities and food (HAF) {{!}} Public Health Blackpool Council |url=https://healthierblackpool.co.uk/holiday-activities-and-food-haf/ |access-date=2023-11-12 |website=Healthierblackpool.co.uk}}</ref>

==== Amateur dramatics ====
There are a number of notable amateur and community theatre companies in Blackpool.

Junction Four Productions, formed in 1904 as Lytham Amateur Operatic Society (LAOS), is one of the original musical theatre groups on the Fylde Coast.

=== Music ===

==== Heritage ====
Blackpool has a rich musical heritage associated with its tourist industry alongside a number of popular music scenes and artists that have emerged there. The first registered venue offering musical entertainment in Blackpool was the original Uncle Tom's Cabin, situated on the cliffs at North Shore, from the early 1860s.<ref name=":03">{{Cite book |last=Appleby |first=Colin |title=Blackpool’s Live Music Rollercoaster: From Uncle Tom’s Cabin to the Waterloo Music Bar.

[[Lawrence Wright (composer)|Lawrence Wright]] was a successful music publisher and songwriter who moved to Blackpool in the 1920s and opened 20 song booths, hiring musicians to play his sheet music inside which passers-by would purchase after entering to listen and sing along.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Novelty dances in Blackpool |url=https://www.showtownblackpool.co.uk/novelty-dances-in-blackpool |access-date=2023-11-22 |website=Showtown |language=en-GB}}</ref>

Blackpool was instrumental in the music of big bands who performed jazz and swing music in its dancehalls and ballrooms from the 1930s-1950s. Frequent performers from 1946 to 1959 were [[Ted Heath (bandleader)|Ted Heath]], [[Joe Loss]] and [[Jack Parnell]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Blackpool’s prestigious ballrooms and the sounds of the big band era |url=https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/heritage-and-retro/retro/blackpools-prestigious-ballrooms-and-the-sounds-of-the-big-band-era-2974827 |website=Blackpool Gazette}}</ref>

In the [[Post-war|post-war period]] Blackpool was the centre of live entertainment outside [[London]] and there was a proliferation of musical talent coming from and discovered in the town. The town hosted three or four [[variety show]]s per night during tourist seasons, each featuring popular music including [[The Shadows]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]] and American stars including [[Frank Sinatra]] who performed twice in the early 1950s.<ref name=":13">{{Cite journal |date=2020 |editor-last=Mazierska |editor-first=Ewa |title=Blackpool in Film and Popular Music |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-49935-8 |journal=SpringerLink |language=en |doi=10.1007/978-3-030-49935-8}}</ref>

The heyday of Blackpool's musical history to date and the golden era was the 1960s when live music was offered in the town's many pubs, clubs, theatres and concert venues to accommodate its millions of visitors.<ref name=":03" /> All the top British [[Beat music|beat groups]] played in Blackpool, forging a tradition at the [[Winter Gardens, Blackpool|Winter Gardens]] Empress Ballroom of staging of rock, alternative and indie music with visiting bands through the decades including [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[the Stone Roses]], [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and [[New Order (band)|New Order]].<ref name=":13" />

Smaller music venues of note include The Galleon bar on Adelaide Street which opened in 1954 and was a magnet for musicians<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Galleon Bar, Blackpool prepares to sail again |url=https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/whats-on/arts-and-entertainment/the-galleon-bar-blackpool-prepares-to-sail-again-2909061 |website=Blackpool Gazette}}</ref> and Mama & Papa Jenks on Talbot Road, which attracted emerging acts of the 1970s including the [[Eurythmics]] and the [[Buzzcocks]] and evolved into a punk music venue hosting bands such as [[the Fits]] and [[the Membranes]].<ref name=":03" />

[[John Lennon]] spent a short time living in Blackpool as a child and would often visit family there and watch musical acts including [[George Formby]] and [[Dickie Valentine]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=We loved you, yeah, yeah, yeah |url=https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/news/we-loved-you-yeah-yeah-yeah-1095157 |website=Blackpool Gazette}}</ref> [[The Beatles]] were booked to perform on [[South Pier, Blackpool|South Pier]] throughout the summer of 1962 but their fame saw them outgrow the venue before they could fulfil their residency. They did go on to play a series of dates in the ABC Theatre and later the Opera House in August 1963 and 1964.<ref name=":03" />

[[The Rolling Stones]] gig at the Empress Ballroom on 24 July 1964 resulted in a [[riot]]. The venue was left badly damaged, with fans smashing two chandeliers, tearing up seats and breaking a [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] grand piano. Two people were hospitalised and around 50 treated for minor injuries. [[Blackpool Council]] banned the Rolling Stones from performing in the town again, lifting the ban 44 years later, although the band is yet to return.<ref name=":03" />

[[Jimi Hendrix]] supported [[Cat Stevens]] at the Odeon complex on 15 April 1967. There are claims Hendrix was refused entry to his hotel after the show due to intoxication. Pink Floyd played the Empress Ballroom a month later, on 26 May 1967. Hendrix and Pink Floyd both returned later that year to perform on the same bill at Blackpool Opera House on 25 November 1967. Pink Floyd returned to Blackpool on 21 March 1969 to play the Blackpool Technical College Arts Ball on 21 March 1969.<ref name=":03" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=auction.sixtiesposters.com: VERY RARE Pink Floyd 1969 Winter Gardens Blackpool ARTS BALL UK Poster |url=https://auction.sixtiesposters.com/Bidding.taf?_function=detail&Auction_uid1=4727812 |access-date=2023-11-22 |website=auction.sixtiesposters.com}}</ref>

[[Factory Records]]' [[Section 25 (band)|Section 25]] formed in Blackpool in 1977. Their key recordings include the US crossover club hit ''Looking Form a Hilltop'' and the album ''From the Hi''p.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Factory Records: SECTION 25 |url=https://www.factoryrecords.org/section-25.php |access-date=2023-11-22 |website=Factoryrecords.org}}</ref> Another Blackpool band signed to the label was Tunnelvision, who recorded just one single for the label in 1981.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Factory Records: TUNNELVISION |url=https://factoryrecords.org/tunnelvision.php |access-date=2023-11-22 |website=factoryrecords.org}}</ref>

==== Inspired by Blackpool ====
The large number of musical artists connected to Blackpool exceeds that of the town's comparable size<ref name=":13" /> and include the band [[Boston Manor (band)|Boston Manor]], [[Chris Lowe]], [[Graham Nash]], [[John Evan]], [[John Robb (musician)|John Robb]], [[Jon Gomm]], [[Karima Francis]], [[Rae Morris]], [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] and [[Section 25 (band)|Section 25]]. With the exception of [[Grime music|grime]] artists, however, their hometown hardly features in the work of these artists and we never heard about ‘Blackpool sound’, as opposed to the [[Beat music|Mersey Sound]] or [[Madchester]].<ref name=":13" />

Blackpool has been referenced within popular music for the best part of a century.<ref name=":23">{{Cite journal |last=Gillon |first=Les |title=Nostalgia and Simulacra: Blackpool in Song |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-49935-8 |journal=Blackpool in Film and Popular Music ed by Ewa Mazierska}}</ref> [[Stanley Holloway]]’s 1932 comic song ''The Lion and Albert'' tells the story of a small child being eaten by a lion at [[Blackpool Zoo]] and [[George Formby]], one of the town's most successful regular performers in the 1930s and ‘40s, penned songs including ''Blackpool Prom'', ''Sitting on the Top of Blackpool Tower'' and ''With My Little Stick of Blackpool Rock''.<ref name=":23" /> The George Formby Society formed at the [[Imperial Hotel, Blackpool|Imperial Hotel]] with 56 members a few months after Formby's death in 1961. Now consisting of over 800 members worldwide, many return to the same hotel quarterly to for society conventions.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Simper |first=David |date=2023-09-14 |title=The George Formby Society in full banjolele swing at The Imperial Hotel |url=https://www.blackpoolsocial.club/40431-turned-out-nice-inside-the-george-formby-society-convention/ |access-date=2023-11-22 |website=Blackpool Social Club |language=en-US}}</ref>

In the latter part of the 20th century songs inspired by Blackpool included, [[Blur (band)|Blur]]’s ''This Is a Low'', [[Soft Cell|Soft Cell's]] ''Say Hello, Wave Goodbye'', [[Manic Street Preachers|Manic Street Preachers']] ''Elvis Impersonator, Blackpool Pier'' and The Kinks’ ''Autumn Almanac'', which has been called ‘the most British song of all time’.<ref name=":13" />

''Up The Pool'' by [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], who formed as a blues-based rock band in the Blackpool in the late 1960s, was released in 1971. It differs from the band's other musical output at the time with frontman [[Ian Anderson]], who lived in Blackpool, choosing to reflect national identity both lyrically and musically in a conscious rejection of the American music that influenced so many other British bands of the era. In ''Blackpool Tower Suite'', Manchester indie band [[World of Twist]] present a personification of the [[Blackpool Tower|Tower]] almost as a female deity presiding over the pleasure grounds of Blackpool.<ref name=":23" />

Blackpool-born singer [[Rae Morris]]’s 2022 album ''Rachel@Fairyland'' pays homage to her hometown with songs referencing Blackpool Tower, childhood memories, the town's LGBTQ+ community and its deprivation. Music videos for singles ''No Woman Is An Island'' and ''Go Dancing'' were shot in Blackpool, as was the video for her 2021 standalone single ''Fish n Chips'', featuring grime artist Sophie Aspin.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rachel@Fairyland delicately offers a snapshot into the life of Rae Morris |url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/reviews/albums/rae-morris-rachel-at-fairyland-album-review |access-date=2023-11-22 |website=The Line of Best Fit |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Blackpool singer songwriter Rae Morris and grime artist Sophie Aspin collaborate on resort dedicated track Fish n Chips |url=https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/whats-on/arts-and-entertainment/blackpool-singer-songwriter-rae-morris-and-grime-artist-sophie-aspin-collaborate-on-resort-dedicated-track-fish-n-chips-3249150 |website=Blackpool Gazette}}</ref>

Many songs about Blackpool reflect its position as a popular holiday destination for the working classes.<ref name=":23" /> Folk singer Howard Broadbent's 1983 song ''Blackpool Belle'' was rerecorded by Bolton folk trio the [[Houghton Weavers]] in 1993 and, like the song ''Blackpool'' by indie band the [[The Delgados|Delgados]], speaks of happy memories of bygone days and of the sense of comradeship. Meanwhile, ''Tatty Seaside Town'' by punk band [[The Membranes]], who formed in Blackpool in the 1970s, reflects the experience of young men growing up there. [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]], in their 2003 song ''Idiot Joy Showland'', reflect on the town's artifice while Macclesfield-based punk band the [[Macc Lads]], in their 1985 song ''Blackpool'', boasts of outrageous and offensive behaviour reflective of the idea of that the town is a place to shed inhibitions.<ref name=":23" />

Recurring motifs in songs about Blackpool include the idea that Blackpool is an important part of English identity,<ref name=":13" /> the distance between the glittering surface and a grimier reality of the town, and of Blackpool as a place of freedom and relative sexual freedom, as embodied by the Kiss Me Quick hat or "saucy postcard".<ref name=":23" /> While depictions of Blackpool in popular music represent a wide range of attitudes to the town, their connection to the English working-class is inevitably a persistent seam running through them.<ref name=":23" />

==== Scenes ====
Blackpool has played a significant role in music scenes including [[northern soul]], [[Punk rock|punk]], [[rave]] and [[Grime music|grime]].

[[Blackpool Mecca|Locarno Mecca]] opened on Central Drive in April 1965 attracting acts including [[Slade]] (1972), [[Bob Marley and the Wailers]] (22 November 1973) and [[Martha and the Vandellas]] (25 February 1977).<ref name=":03" /> The venue went on to become home to one of four legendary northern soul nights in the Highland Room, established in 1970 by local DJ, Tony Jebb along with Les Cokell, followed by Ian Levine and [[Colin Curtis (DJ)|Colin Curtis]].<ref name="Page">{{Cite web |last=Page |first=Robin |date=2021-07-26 |title=A Beginner’s Guide to Original Northern Soul Venues |url=https://heritagecalling.com/2021/07/26/a-beginners-guide-to-original-northern-soul-venues/ |access-date=2023-11-22 |website=The Historic England Blog |language=en-GB}}</ref> At the end of the 1970s it was renamed Tiffany's and later the Rhythm Dome, home to Federation – influential in the 1990s [[House music|house]] and rave scene.

Blackpool's embracing of punk in the 1970s and the subsequent middle-class reaction to it has been likened to the anxieties of the middle classes during the influx of working-class visitors arriving via the railway system to Blackpool with in Victorian times.<ref name=":23" /> Blackpool's connection with punk is also said to reflect and gains its strength from Blackpool's poor life prospects in terms of employment, recreational drug use, health, housing and antisocial behaviour.<ref name=":32">{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first=Philip |title=This Sore and Broken Blackpool Legacy, or the Enduring Appeal of Punk Rock in Blackpool |journal=Blackpool in Film and Popular Music ed by Ewa Mazierska}}</ref>

Blackpool was not initially at the forefront of the punk revolution, with its youth culture still preoccupied by northern soul throughout the ‘70s, and became more well known for its homegrown post-punk groups, [[The Membranes]], [[The Fits]], [[Section 25 (band)|Section 25]] and the Ceramic Hobbs.<ref name=":32" /> But punk has held on well in Blackpool which has hosted the annual [[Rebellion Festival]] since 1996, attracting international visitors and claiming to be the largest independent punk music festival in the world. Its line up regularly includes many major bands from the heyday of punk. [[Sham 69]], who played the festival in 1996, celebrated the event and its promotion of the punk values of acceptance and solidarity with their song ''Blackpool'', released the following year.<ref name=":23" /><ref name=":32" />

In the mid-2010s a number of mostly school-aged MCs began to showcase themselves on YouTube channels including Blackpool Grime Media (BGMedia).<ref name=":42">{{Cite journal |last=Rymajdo |first=Kamila |title=‘It’s Grime Up North’: The Phenomenon of Blackpool Grime |journal=Blackpool in Film and Popular Music ed by Ewa Mazierska}}</ref> The aggressive and unapologetic branch of rap resonated with disaffected young people in Blackpool.<ref name="Charlesworth">{{Cite web |last=Charlesworth |first=Antonia |date=2020-10-20 |title=Taking Flight - Blackpool Grime and House of Wingz |url=https://www.blackpoolsocial.club/30370-taking-flight-blackpool-grime/ |access-date=2023-11-22 |website=Blackpool Social Club |language=en-US}}</ref> Artists on BGMedia, including Afghan Dan, Little T, Millie B and Sophie Aspin, became the subject of a 2016 [[Vice Media|Vice]] documentary ''Noisey Blackpool: The Controversial Rise of Blackpool Grime'', followed by 2017's ''Noisey Blackpool 2: One Year On''. And in October 2019 [[Channel 4]] aired ''It's Grime Up North'', a documentary criticised for its "sneering derision" of children as young as 12 growing up in challenging circumstances.<ref name="Charlesworth" /> Meanwhile, Blackpool grime's amateur approach was not taken seriously by music industry gatekeepers.<ref name=":42" /> Millie B's 2016 track ''M to the B'' is a viral song that sparked a ‘[[chav]]-make-up’ trend on [[TikTok]]. The song ‘sends’ for Aspin as the pair were pitted against each other although the pair are now friends. Aspin claims that at the time she was exploited and incentivised with drugs to perform. Hip hop collective House of Wingz has gone on to work with Sophie Aspin and Millie B, teaming them up with Grammy-nominated producer [[Nat Powers]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Club |first=Blackpool Social |date=2023-04-04 |title=Beats, grime and strife |url=https://www.blackpoolsocial.club/37004-beats-grime-and-strife/ |access-date=2023-11-22 |website=Blackpool Social Club |language=en-US}}</ref>

The Japanese film ''[[Shall We Dance (1996 film)|Shall We Dance?]]'' (1996) closes with a scene at the World Ballroom Dancing Championships in Blackpool. All the hair styling for the film was completed by Blackpool-born-and-bred hairstylist Eileen Clough, who has been in the trade since the 1960s. In the Hollywood [[Shall We Dance (2004 film)|remake of the film]] (2004), directed by Peter Chelsom, Blackpool is mentioned but not shown.

Blackpool is the setting for ''[[Bhaji on the Beach]]'' (1993) directed by [[Gurinder Chadha]]. The film ''[[Like It Is (film)|Like It Is]]'' (1998) directed by Paul Oremland was also partly filmed in Blackpool. The opening scenes were filmed in the Flamingo. The 2005 television comedy/thriller series ''[[Funland (TV series)|Funland]]'' revolved around the fictionalised, seedier aspects of Blackpool.

The town also features heavily in the BBC television serial ''[[Blackpool (television)|Blackpool]]'', starring [[David Morrissey]], [[Sarah Parish]] and [[David Tennant]] and first broadcast in 2004, and the one-off follow-up ''[[Viva Blackpool]]'', broadcast in June 2006.

In 2006 Lion Television filmed ''The Great British Summer'', which featured many buildings in Blackpool. The Royal Windsor Hotel was featured, with the owner talking all about the hotel seasons and industry. [[Bernard Manning]] was also shown at the hotel doing his spot through the season hosted by Blackpool Born local Entertainer & DJ Gordon Head and other local acts. ''The Great British Summer'' was narrated by [[Alan Titchmarsh]].

Between 10 September 2012 and 19 November 2012 the resort was featured in [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[999: What's Your Emergency?]]''

The resort was also featured in the three-part reality television series, ''Blackpool Lights'' on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] in December 2013.<ref name="five">{{Cite web |title=Blackpool Lights – The place where anything and everything can happen |url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/blackpool-lights |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708002421/http://www.channel5.com/shows/blackpool-lights |archive-date=8 July 2014 |access-date=3 July 2014 |publisher=[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]}}</ref><ref name="gazette6334967">{{Cite web |date=24 December 2013 |title=Resort to shine in new TV documentary, Blackpool Lights |url=http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/what-s-on/tv-film/resort-to-shine-in-new-tv-documentary-blackpool-lights-1-6334967 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217182525/http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/what-s-on/tv-film/resort-to-shine-in-new-tv-documentary-blackpool-lights-1-6334967 |archive-date=17 February 2014 |access-date=3 July 2014 |website=[[Blackpool Gazette]]}}</ref>

===Professional wrestling===
The Pleasure Beach's Horseshoe Show Bar was home to [[professional wrestling]] events throughout the season, promoted by Bobby Baron. The bar shows were home to a "wrestling booth" where members of the public could challenge the wrestlers for cash prizes for each round they survived. These challenges would be taken by [[Catch wrestling|shooters]], wrestlers skilled in the brutal submission holds of [[catch wrestling]], which they could deploy to defend the prize money even against skilled [[amateur wrestler]]s. Booths such as these had been a foundation of the professional wrestling industry since the 19th century, and Baron's booth is reputed to have been the last of its kind in the world.<ref name="Regal">''Walking A Golden Mile'' William Regal, WWE Books 2005</ref>

Numerous renowned professional wrestlers worked as carnival shooters at the booth, including future [[WWE]] star [[William Regal]]; his tag team partner [[Robbie Brookside]]; Shak Khan, who runs a catch wrestling school in the area; Dave Duran (John Palin) and future women's champion [[Klondyke Kate]]. The booth ended with Baron's death in 1994, although other promoters have since held shows in the bar.<ref name="Regal" /> Additionally, the [[Tower Circus]] was a frequent venue for wrestling shows. A photograph of noted wrestling [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]] [[Jack Pye]] in action at the circus was, for some time in the late 2000s, displayed by the entrance to the circus. The tradition was revived by [[All Star Wrestling]] when they promoted a summer season at the venue in 2008, and a similar summer season in 2012 at the Winter Gardens.  The Tower Ballroom hosted one date of the six show live tour of the ''[[World of Sport Wrestling]]'' TV show in February 2019.

WWE held a tournament at the [[Empress Ballroom]] on 14 and 15 January 2017 to crown the inaugural [[WWE United Kingdom Champion]]. In attendance were Regal and [[Triple H]], with the latter commenting to local journalists, "Blackpool has this reputation. It's easy to get to, a lot of people come here and when they come here they lose it and that's what we wanted.

There were previously two synagogues in Blackpool for its Jewish population, now down to one. The [[Blackpool Reform Jewish Congregation]] caters to the [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] population and is located on Raikes Parade with a synagogue hall and classroom facilities, a purpose-built sanctuary hall and an assembly room. [[Blackpool United Hebrew Congregation]] was an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] synagogue located on Leamington Road with a synagogue hall and community centre. The synagogue closed in May 2012 due to a declining Orthodox population, with the final rabbi David Braunold having retired in 2011.<ref name="B4ME001" /> As of January 2022, the building which formerly housed the synagogue was awaiting new use.

{{Main|List of schools in Blackpool}}

As well as 29 state primary schools and eight state secondary schools, there is also a range of activities for children and young people in the town. Some of these are delivered by ''Blackpool Young People Services'' (a part of Blackpool Council).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Duncan Hodgson |title=rubothered.co.uk |url=http://www.rubothered.co.uk |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112041307/http://www.rubothered.co.uk/ |archive-date=12 January 2012 |access-date=9 September 2012 |publisher=rubothered.co.uk}}</ref>

==Transport==
===Air===
[[Blackpool Airport]] operated regular charter and scheduled flights throughout the UK and Europe. The airport is actually just over the borough boundary into [[Fylde (borough)|Fylde Borough]], although a proposal to reorganise Blackpool's borders would see the airport incorporated into Blackpool Borough. This airport, formerly known as Blackpool Squires Gate Airport, is one of the oldest in the UK having hosted public flying meetings in 1909 and 1910. After a gap, it was active from the 1930s to mid 2014 and from December 2014 to date. Airlines that served Blackpool, before its temporary closure in late 2014, included [[Jet2.com]] and [[Aer Arran]]. The airport was reopened to small aircraft after failing to find a buyer in December 2014.<ref>{{Cite web |date=19 November 2014 |title=Airport could see return of commercial flights |url=http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/news/business/local-business/airport-could-see-return-of-commercial-flights-1-6961324 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223142017/http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/news/business/local-business/airport-could-see-return-of-commercial-flights-1-6961324 |archive-date=23 December 2014 |access-date=12 March 2015 |website=Blackpool Gazette}}</ref>

The airport's most recent scheduled services to [[Belfast]] and the [[Isle of Man]] ceased when [[Citywing]] suspended operations in March 2017. Access to the town by air is now via [[Liverpool John Lennon Airport]] or [[Manchester Airport]], both approximately {{convert|40|mi}} away by road.

In 1927 the local council announced that an airfield would be built near Stanley Park, which would become [[Stanley Park Aerodrome]] offering flights to the [[Isle of Man]] for £1-16s–0d (£1.80).<ref name="BIA001">{{Cite web |title=History of Blackpool Airport |url=http://www.blackpoolinternational.com/about-us/history.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005223406/http://www.blackpoolinternational.com/about-us/history.php |archive-date=5 October 2007 |access-date=5 October 2007 |publisher=[[Blackpool Airport]]}}</ref> The airport opened in 1929 and was officially opened by Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] in 1931.<ref name="CT001">{{Cite web |title=Control Towers: RAF Stanley Park Airfield |url=http://www.controltowers.co.uk/S/Stanley_Park.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019133349/http://www.controltowers.co.uk/S/Stanley_Park.htm |archive-date=19 October 2007 |access-date=5 October 2007 |publisher=Control Towers}}</ref> However, with the opening of Squires Gate Airport a decision was announced in 1936 by the [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]] to close the Stanley Park airfield. In fact, civil operations continued until the outbreak of war with scheduled services to the Isle of Man and elsewhere.<ref name="RAS001">{{Cite book |last=Stroud, John |title=Railway Air Services |publisher=[[Ian Allan Publishing]] |year=1987 |isbn=0-7110-1743-3 |page=129}}</ref> During the war, Stanley Park was used as a [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) training station, known as No. 3 School of Technical Training. [[Vickers]] assembled many [[Vickers Wellington|Wellington]] bombers here and [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s were repaired for the RAF. The airfield closed in 1947. The land on which the airport stood now covers [[Blackpool Zoo]] and a hotel and golf course. The [[hangar]]s from the old airport are still in use at Blackpool Zoo as the main entrance building, Playbarn, Education Academy and camel house.<ref name="CT001" />

===Bus and coach===

* [[National Express Coaches|National Express]] operates the main long-distance coach services in and out of Blackpool

Facilities include:
* [[Blackpool bus station|Blackpool Talbot Road Bus Station]], which was the main town centre bus station but is now a gym. Blackpool Transport stopped using the bus station in the early 2000s after a disagreement with Blackpool Council regarding the state of the bus station building. Blackpool Transport now use Market Street and Corporation Street, in the town centre, as their bus interchange. National Express have also recently stopped using this bus station, moving to the new National Express Blackpool Central Coach Station.
* Blackpool Central Coach Station<ref>{{Cite web |title=Blackpool Council |url=http://www.blackpool.gov.uk/news |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913094547/http://www.blackpool.gov.uk/news |archive-date=13 September 2012 |access-date=17 August 2012 |publisher=Blackpool.gov.uk}}</ref> is the main coach station for all National Express coach services. which is also used by some independent coach operators. The coach station has a booking office and toilet facilities.
* Blackpool Lonsdale Road Coach Station was the main coach station for [[South Shore, Blackpool|South Shore]] district of Blackpool. This was mainly used by independent coach operators. The coach station has a café, shop and toilet facilities but is in a state of disrepair.
* Blackpool Colosseum Bus & Coach Station, which was the main bus and coach station in South Shore. Located next to Blackpool Transport Headquarters, it was demolished to make way for a [[Somerfield]] supermarket.  The site is now occupied by the link road from the M55 motorway and additional depot parking.

[[File:Blackpool North railway station interior.jpg|thumb|Interior of [[Blackpool North railway station|Blackpool North station]]]]
Train operators that serve Blackpool are:
* [[Avanti West Coast]]
* [[Northern Trains]]

Stations in the town are, or were:
* [[Blackpool North railway station|Blackpool North]] (originally Talbot Road)
* [[Blackpool Pleasure Beach railway station|Blackpool Pleasure Beach]] (originally Burlington Road Halt)
* [[Blackpool South railway station|Blackpool South]] (originally Waterloo Road)

Blackpool once had two railway terminals with a total of over 30 platforms, mainly used by excursion traffic in the summer. [[Blackpool Central railway station|Blackpool Central]], close to [[Blackpool Tower]], was closed in 1964, while [[Blackpool North railway station|Blackpool North]] was largely demolished and rebuilt as a smaller facility. The route of the former excursion line into Blackpool Central is now used as a link road from the M55 motorway to the town centre. The line into Blackpool via [[Lytham St Annes]] now has a station serving [[Blackpool Pleasure Beach]] but terminates at [[Blackpool South railway station|Blackpool South station]]. The line into North station is now the more important.

===Road===
The [[M55 motorway]] links the town to the national motorway network. Other major roads in the town are the [[A583 road|A583]] to [[Kirkham, Lancashire|Kirkham]] and [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], the [[A587 road|A587]] and [[A585 road|A585]] to [[Fleetwood]], the [[A586 road|A586]] to [[Poulton-le-Fylde]], [[Garstang]] and [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] and the [[A584 road|A584]] and B5261, which both lead to [[Lytham St Annes]].

{{Main|Blackpool Tramway}}

The [[Blackpool Tramway]] runs from [[Starr Gate]] in Blackpool to [[Fleetwood]] and is the only surviving first-generation tramway in the United Kingdom.<ref name="TT001">{{Cite web |title=Blackpool trams |url=http://www.thetrams.co.uk/blackpool/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701182435/http://www.thetrams.co.uk/blackpool/ |archive-date=1 July 2011 |access-date=3 November 2007 |publisher=thetrams.co.uk}}</ref> The tramway dates back to 1885 and is one of the oldest electric tramways in the world. It is run by [[Blackpool Transport]], owned by Blackpool Council. The tramway runs for {{convert|11|mi|km}} and carries 6,500,000 passengers each year.<ref name="FWN764391">{{Cite news |date=26 March 2004 |title=Anger over tram network |url=http://www.fleetwoodtoday.co.uk/fleetwood/ANGER-OVER-TRAM-NETWORK.764391.jp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401130235/http://www.fleetwoodtoday.co.uk/fleetwood/ANGER-OVER-TRAM-NETWORK.764391.jp |archive-date=1 April 2008 |access-date=3 November 2007 |publisher=[[Fleetwood Weekly News]]}}</ref>

The tramway was for a long time the only working tramway in the United Kingdom outside of museums. It was also the UK's first electric system. However, there are now a number of other tramways, including [[Manchester Metrolink]], [[Sheffield Supertram]], [[Edinburgh Trams]] and [[West Midlands Metro]].

On 1 February 2008 it was announced that the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] had agreed to a joint Blackpool Transport and Blackpool Council bid for funding toward the total upgrade of the track. The government contributed £60.3m of the total £85.3m cost. Blackpool Council and Lancashire County Council each provided about £12.5m. The Government's decision meant that the entire length of the tramway from Starr Gate to Fleetwood was upgraded and also sixteen new trams joined the fleet.<ref name="Gazette3734967">{{Cite news |last=Parkinson |first=Shelagh |date=1 February 2008 |title=Blackpool gets £85 m for trams |url=http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/blackpoolnews/Blackpool-gets-85-m-for-trams.3734967.jp |access-date=1 February 2008 |work=[[Blackpool Gazette]]}}</ref>

In April 2012, the tramway reopened after the major reconstruction. Day to day services are run by the 16 [[Bombardier Flexity 2 (Blackpool)|Flexity 2]] trams. Several double deck [[English Electric Balloon]] trams from the older fleet have been widened to work alongside the new trams to provide additional capacity in the summer months. Several non-modified older trams also operate a heritage service from Pleasure Beach to Little Bispham on weekends and holidays with a slight upcharge.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Heritage Trams |url=http://www.blackpooltransport.com/Heritage.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817232546/http://www.blackpooltransport.com/Heritage.aspx |archive-date=17 August 2012 |access-date=9 September 2012 |publisher=Blackpool Transport}}</ref>

An extension of the new service to [[Blackpool North railway station]] was planned to open by April 2019, between the existing North Pier stop of the Blackpool Tramway, along Talbot Road, and terminating at Blackpool North railway station. This was delayed and in September 2021 was rescheduled to open in Summer 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |date=21 September 2021 |title=Blackpool Tramway Extension, Phase 2 Talbot Gateway • Live Blackpool |url=https://www.liveblackpool.info/about/town-centre/blackpool-tramway-extension/ |website=Blackpool}}</ref>
