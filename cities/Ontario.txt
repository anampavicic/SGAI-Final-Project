== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Ontario}}
{{See also|List of census divisions of Ontario|Geography of Canada|List of protected areas of Ontario|l3=List of parks and protected areas of Ontario}}
[[File:BlackRiver1.JPG|thumb|Typical landscape of the [[Canadian Shield]] at [[Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands Provincial Park]], located in [[Central Ontario]].]]
The thinly populated [[Canadian Shield]], which dominates the northwestern and central portions of the province, comprises over half the land area of Ontario. Although this area mostly does not support agriculture, it is rich in [[mineral]]s, partly covered by the [[Central Canadian Shield forests|Central]] and [[Midwestern Canadian Shield forests]], and studded with lakes and rivers. [[Northern Ontario]] is subdivided into two sub-regions: [[Northwestern Ontario]] and [[Northeastern Ontario]].

The virtually unpopulated [[Hudson Bay Lowlands]] in the extreme north and northeast are mainly swampy and sparsely forested.

[[Southern Ontario]], which is further sub-divided into four sub-regions: [[Central Ontario]] (although not actually the province's geographic centre), [[Eastern Ontario]], [[Golden Horseshoe]] and [[Southwestern Ontario]] (parts of which were formerly referred to as Western Ontario).

Despite the rarity of mountainous terrain in the province, there are large areas of uplands, particularly within the Canadian Shield which traverses the province from northwest to southeast and also above the [[Niagara Escarpment]] which crosses the south. The highest point is [[Ishpatina Ridge]] at {{convert|693|m|ft|0}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] in [[Temagami]], Northeastern Ontario. In the south, elevations of over {{convert|500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} are surpassed near Collingwood, above the Blue Mountains in the Dundalk Highlands and in hilltops near the [[Madawaska River (Ontario)|Madawaska River]] in [[Renfrew County]].

The [[Carolinian forest]] zone covers most of the southwestern region of the province. The temperate and fertile Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence Valley in the south is part of the [[Eastern Great Lakes lowland forests]] [[ecoregion]] where the forest has now been largely replaced by agriculture, industrial and urban development. A well-known geographic feature is [[Niagara Falls]], part of the [[Niagara Escarpment]]. The [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] allows navigation to and from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] as far inland as [[Thunder Bay]] in Northwestern Ontario. [[Northern Ontario]] covers approximately 87% of the province's surface area; conversely, Southern Ontario contains 94% of the population.

[[Point Pelee National Park|Point Pelee]] is a peninsula of Lake Erie in southwestern Ontario (near [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]) that is the southernmost extent of Canada's mainland. [[Pelee, Ontario|Pelee Island]] and [[Middle Island (Lake Erie)|Middle Island]] in Lake Erie extend slightly farther. All are south of [[42nd parallel north|42°N]]&nbsp;– slightly farther south than the northern border of [[California]].

Ontario has three main climatic regions:
* The surrounding Great Lakes greatly influence the climatic region of southern Ontario.<ref name="EC"/> During the fall and winter, the release of heat stored by the lakes moderates the climate near the shores which<ref name=EPA>{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/atlas/glat-ch2.html |title = Natural Processes in the Great Lakes |publisher = US Environmental Protection Agency |access-date = March 25, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202002550/http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/atlas/glat-ch2.html |archive-date = February 2, 2013 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> give parts of southern Ontario milder winters than mid-continental areas at lower latitudes.<ref name= EPA/> Parts of Southwestern Ontario and the Niagara region (generally south of a line from Sarnia–Toronto) have a moderate [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfa''), similar to the inland [[Mid-Atlantic states]] and the [[Great Lakes]] portion of the [[Midwestern United States]]. The region has warm to hot, humid summers and cold winters. Annual precipitation ranges from {{convert|750|-|1000|mm|in|abbr=on}} and is well distributed throughout the year. Most of this region lies in the lee of the Great Lakes, making for abundant snow in some areas. In December 2010, the [[snowbelt]] set a new record when it was hit by more than a metre of snow within 48 hours.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/snowstorm-shuts-down-london-ont-1.929437 |work=CBC News |title=Snowstorm shuts down London, Ont |date=December 8, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308071854/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/snowstorm-shuts-down-london-ont-1.929437 |archive-date=March 8, 2014 }}</ref>
* The next climatic region is Central and Eastern Ontario, which has a moderate [[humid continental climate]] (Köppen ''Dfb''). This region has warm and sometimes hot summers with colder, longer winters, ample snowfall (even in regions not directly in the snowbelts) and annual precipitation similar to the rest of Southern Ontario.<ref name="UBCgeo" />

In the northeastern parts of Ontario, extending south as far as [[Kirkland Lake]], the cold waters of Hudson Bay depress summer temperatures, making it cooler than other locations at similar latitudes. The same is true on the northern shore of [[Lake Superior]], which cools hot, humid air from the south, leading to cooler summer temperatures.<ref name= UBCgeo/> Along the eastern shores of Lake Superior and [[Lake Huron]] winter temperatures are slightly moderated but come with frequent heavy [[lake-effect snow]] squalls that increase seasonal snowfall totals to upwards of {{convert|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in some places. These regions have higher annual precipitation, in some places over {{convert|100|cm|in|abbr=on}}.
[[File:Lake Effect Snow on Earth.jpg|thumb|Cold northwesterly wind over the [[Great Lakes]] creating [[lake-effect snow]]. Lake-effect snow most frequently occurs in the [[snowbelt]] regions of the province.]]
* The northernmost parts of Ontario&nbsp;– primarily north of 50°N&nbsp;– have a [[subarctic climate]] (Köppen ''Dfc'') with long, severely cold winters and short, cool to warm summers with dramatic temperature changes possible in all seasons. With no major mountain ranges blocking sinking Arctic [[air mass]]es, temperatures of {{convert|-40|C|abbr=on}} are not uncommon; snow remains on the ground for sometimes over half the year. Snow accumulation can be high in some areas.<ref name= EC/> Precipitation is generally less than {{convert|70|cm|in|abbr=on}} and peaks in the summer months in the form of rain or thunderstorms.<ref name= EC/>

===Indigenous habitation (pre–1610)===
{{Main|Settlement of the Americas}}
[[Paleo-Indians]] were the first people to settle on the lands of Ontario, about 11,000 years ago, after crossing the [[Bering land bridge]] from Asia to North America between 25,000 to 50,000 years ago.{{Sfn|Baskerville|2005|p=1}}<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Murphy |first1=Carl |last2=Hinshelwood |first2=Andrew |last3=Daechsel |first3=Hugh |last4=Bursey |first4=Jeff |title=The Archaeology of Ontario: A Summary |url=https://ontarioarchaeology.org/resources/summary-of-ontario-archaeology/ |access-date=2024-06-15 |website=[[Ontario Archaeological Society]] |language=en-CA}}</ref> During the [[Archaic period (North America)|Archaic period]], which lasted from 8000-1000 [[Anno Domini|BC]], the population slowly increased, with a generally [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] [[hunter-gatherer]] society and a warmer climate. Trading routes also began emerging along the [[St. Lawrence River]] and around the [[Great Lakes]].{{Sfn|Baskerville|2005|pp=2-3}} Hunting and gathering remained predominant throughout the early [[Woodland period]], and social structures and trade continued to develop.{{Sfn|Baskerville|2005|p=4}} Around 500 [[AD]], corn cultivation began, later expanding to include [[bean]]s and [[Cucurbita|squash]] around 1100 AD.{{Efn|These three agricultural crops are known as the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)]]}} Increased agriculture enabled more permanent, fortified, and significantly larger settlements. In [[southern Ontario]] during the 1400s, the population of some villages numbered in the thousands, with [[Longhouses of the Indigenous peoples of North America|longhouses]] that could house over a hundred people. Around this time, large-scale warfare began in southern Ontario, leading to the emergence of [[Iroquoian peoples|Iroquoian]] groups, including the [[Neutral Confederacy]], [[Erie people|Erie]] and [[Wendats|Wendat]] (Huron).{{Sfn|Baskerville|2005|p=5}} Groups in [[northern Ontario]] were primarily [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] and included the [[Ojibwe]], who traded with the Iroquois.{{Sfn|Baskerville|2005|pp=9-11}}

Many ethnocultural groups emerged and came to exist on the lands of Ontario: the [[Algonquin people|Algonquins]], [[Mississaugas]], [[Ojibway]], [[Cree]], [[Odawa]], [[Potawatomi|Pottowatomi]], and [[Iroquois]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/inquiries/ipperwash/policy_part/research/pdf/Spotton_Profile-of-Aboriginal-Peoples-in-Ontario.pdf|title=A Profile of Aboriginal Peoples in Ontario|access-date=July 10, 2022|archive-date=January 19, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220119062558/http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/inquiries/ipperwash/policy_part/research/pdf/Spotton_Profile-of-Aboriginal-Peoples-in-Ontario.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Pays d'en Haut (1610–1763)===
{{Main|Exploration of North America|New France|Pays d'en Haut}}
In the 15th century, the [[Fall of Constantinople|Byzantine Empire fell]], prompting Western Europeans to search for new [[sea lane|sea routes]] to the [[Far East]]. Around 1522–1523, [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] persuaded [[King Francis I of France]] to commission an expedition to find a western route to [[Cathay]] (China) via a [[Northwest Passage]]. Though this expedition was unsuccessful, it established the name "[[New France]]" for northeastern North America.{{sfn|Charpentier|Durocher|Laville|Linteau|1985|p=50}} After a few expeditions, France mostly abandoned North America for 50 years because of its financial crisis; France was involved in the [[Italian Wars]] and there were religious wars between [[Protestant]]s and [[Catholic]]s.<ref>{{cite book|first=Marcel |last=Trudel |title=Histoire de la [[Nouvelle-France]] : les vaines tentatives 1524–1603 |publisher=Fides |year=1963 |page=307}}</ref> Around 1580 however, the rise of the [[fur trade]] (particularly the demand for [[beaver]] pelts), reignited French interest.<ref name=mathieu>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/fr/article/nouvelle-france|encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|title=Nouvelle-France|trans-title=New France|language=FR|last=Mathieu|first=Jacques|date=September 4, 2013|access-date=July 10, 2022|archive-date=July 10, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220710044155/https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/fr/article/nouvelle-france|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1608, [[Samuel de Champlain]] established France's first colonial settlement in New France, the [[Habitation de Québec]] (now [[Quebec City]]), in the [[Canada (New France)|colony of Canada]] (now southern Quebec). Afterwards, French explorers continued to travel west, establishing new villages along the coasts of the Saint Lawrence River. French explorers, the first of which was [[Étienne Brûlé]] who explored the Georgian Bay area in 1610–1612,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/82078/Etienne-Brule|title=Étienne Brûlé|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|access-date=January 5, 2007|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207030900/https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/82078/Etienne-Brule|archive-date=December 7, 2008}}</ref> mapped [[Southern Ontario]] and called the region the [[Pays d'en Haut]] ("Upper Country"), in reference to the region being upstream of the Saint Lawrence River. The colony of the Pays d'en Haut was formally established in 1610 as an administrative dependency of Canada, and was for defence and business rather than a settlement colony. The territory of the Pays-d'en-Haut was quite large and would today include the province of Ontario, as well as, in whole or in part, the American states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York. Indigenous peoples were the vast majority of the Pays d'en Haut population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca/francophonie/Nlle-France_Pays_d'en-Haut.htm#:~:text=Le%20premier%20Europ%C3%A9en%20%C3%A0%20s,Outaouais%20et%20du%20lac%20Nipissing|title=Le Pays-d'en-Haut (Canada)|access-date=July 16, 2022|archive-date=June 21, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210621223241/https://www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca/francophonie/Nlle-France_Pays_d%27en-Haut.htm#:~:text=Le%20premier%20Europ%C3%A9en%20%C3%A0%20s,Outaouais%20et%20du%20lac%20Nipissing.|url-status=live}}</ref>[[File:1755 Bellin Map of the Great Lakes - Geographicus - GreatLakes-bellin-1755.jpg|left|thumb|A 1755 map of the ''[[Pays d'en Haut]]'' region of [[New France]], an area that included most of Ontario]] As for Northern Ontario, the English explorer [[Henry Hudson]] sailed into [[Hudson Bay]] in 1611 and claimed its drainage basin for England. The area would become known as [[Rupert's Land]].

[[Samuel de Champlain]] reached Lake Huron in 1615, and French missionaries, such as the [[Jésuites]] and [[Society of the Priests of Saint Sulpice|Supliciens]], began to establish posts along the Great Lakes. The French allied with most Indigenous groups of Ontario, all for the fur trade and for defence against Iroquois attacks (which would later be called the [[Iroquois Wars]]). The French would declare their Indigenous allies to be subjects of the King of France and would often act as mediators between different groups. The Iroquois later allied themselves with the British.<ref name="thefrenchshouldvewon">{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.on.ca/ont/portal/!ut/p/.cmd/cs/.ce/7_0_A/.s/7_0_252/_s.7_0_A/7_0_252/_l/en?docid=004520|title=About Ontario; History; French and British Struggle for Domination|work=Government of Ontario|access-date=January 5, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905194801/http://www.gov.on.ca/ont/portal/!ut/p/.cmd/cs/.ce/7_0_A/.s/7_0_252/_s.7_0_A/7_0_252/_l/en?docid=004520|archive-date=September 5, 2007}}</ref>

From 1634 to 1640, the Huron were devastated by European infectious diseases, such as [[measles]] and [[smallpox]], to which they had no immunity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ontarioarchaeology.on.ca/summary/contact.htm |title=The Contact Period |work=ontarioarchaeology.com |access-date=September 26, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003124851/http://www.ontarioarchaeology.on.ca/summary/contact.htm |archive-date=October 3, 2009}}</ref> By 1700, the Iroquois had been driven out or left the area that would become Ontario and the Mississaugas of the Ojibwa had settled the north shore of Lake Ontario. The remaining Huron settled north of Quebec.

During the [[French and Indian War]], the North American theatre of the [[Seven Years' War]] of 1754 to 1763, the British defeated the armies of New France and its Indigenous allies. In the [[Treaty of Paris 1763]] France ceded most of its possessions in North America to Britain. Using the [[Quebec Act]], Britain re-organised the territory into the [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Province of Quebec]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/PreConfederation/qa_1774.html|title=The Quebec Act of 1774|website=Solon.org|access-date=January 15, 2007|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207151343/http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/PreConfederation/qa_1774.html|archive-date=February 7, 2007}}</ref>

Other Iroquois, also displaced from New York were resettled in 1784 at the [[Six Nations of the Grand River|Six Nations]] reserve at the west end of Lake Ontario. The Mississaugas, displaced by European settlements, would later move to Six Nations also.

After the American War of Independence, the first reserves for First Nations were established. These are situated at [[Six Nations of the Grand River|Six Nations]] (1784), [[Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory|Tyendinaga]] (1793) and [[Akwesasne]] (1795). Six Nations and Tyendinaga were established by the British for those Indigenous groups who had fought on the side of the British, and were expelled from the new United States. Akwesasne was a pre-existing Mohawk community and its borders were formalized under the 1795 [[Jay Treaty]].

In 1788, while part of the province of Quebec, southern Ontario was divided into four [[District#Ontario|districts]]: [[Western District, Upper Canada|Hesse]], [[Eastern District, Upper Canada|Lunenburg]], [[Midland District, Upper Canada|Mecklenburg]], and [[Home District|Nassau]]. In 1792, the four districts were renamed: Hesse became the Western District, Lunenburg became the Eastern District, Mecklenburg became the Midland District, and Nassau became the Home District. Counties were created within the districts.

The population of Canada west of the St. Lawrence-Ottawa River confluence substantially increased during this period, a fact recognized by the [[Constitutional Act 1791|''Constitutional Act'' of 1791]], which split Quebec into [[the Canadas]]: [[Upper Canada]] southwest of the St. Lawrence-Ottawa River confluence, and [[Lower Canada]] east of it.

===Upper Canada (1791–1841)===

By 1798, there were eight districts: Eastern, Home, [[Johnstown District, Upper Canada|Johnstown]], [[London District, Upper Canada|London]], Midland, [[Newcastle District|Newcastle]], [[Niagara District|Niagara]], and Western. By 1826, there were eleven districts: [[Bathurst District|Bathurst]], Eastern, [[Gore District, Upper Canada|Gore]], Home, Johnstown, London, Midland, Newcastle, Niagara, [[Ottawa District|Ottawa]], and Western. By 1838, there were twenty districts: Bathurst, Brock, Colbourne, [[Dalhousie District|Dalhousie]], Eastern, Gore, Home, Huron, Johnstown, London, Midland, Newcastle, Niagara, Ottawa, Prince Edward, [[Simcoe County|Simcoe]], Talbot, Victoria, [[Wellington District, Upper Canada|Wellington]], and Western.

American troops in the [[War of 1812]] invaded Upper Canada across the [[Niagara River]] and the [[Detroit River]], but were defeated and pushed back by the British, Canadian [[fencibles]] and militias, and [[First Nations in Canada|First Nations]] warriors. However, the Americans eventually gained control of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. The 1813 [[Battle of York]] saw American troops defeat the garrison at the Upper Canada capital of [[York, Upper Canada|York]]. The Americans looted the town and burned the Upper Canada Parliament Buildings during their brief occupation. The British would [[Burning of Washington|burn]] the American capital of Washington, D.C. in 1814.
[[File:Push on, brave York volunteers(large).jpg|thumb|Depiction of the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]], during the [[War of 1812]]. [[Upper Canada]] was an active theatre of operation during the conflict.]]
After the War of 1812, relative stability allowed for increasing numbers of immigrants to arrive from Europe rather than from the United States. As was the case in the previous decades, this immigration shift was encouraged by the colonial leaders. Despite affordable and often free land, many arriving newcomers, mostly from Britain and Ireland, found frontier life with the harsh climate difficult, and some of those with the means eventually returned home or went south. However, population growth far exceeded emigration in the following decades. It was a mostly agrarian-based society, but canal projects and a new network of plank roads spurred greater trade within the colony and with the United States, thereby improving previously damaged relations over time.

Meanwhile, Ontario's numerous waterways aided travel and transportation into the interior and supplied [[Hydropower|water power]] for development. As the population increased, so did the industries and transportation networks, which in turn led to further development. By the end of the century, Ontario vied with Quebec as the nation's leader in terms of growth in population, industry, arts and communications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.ca/virtual-vault/026018-119.01-e.php?q1=People&PHPSESSID=709io6475tfesngi2m7226o454|title=ARCHIVED – People – Virtual Vault – Library and Archives Canada|website=Collectionscanada.ca|access-date=June 7, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321204831/http://collectionscanada.ca/virtual-vault/026018-119.01-e.php?phpsessid=709io6475tfesngi2m7226o454&q1=people|archive-date=March 21, 2016}}</ref>

Unrest in the colony began to chafe against the aristocratic [[Family Compact]] who governed while benefiting economically from the region's resources, and who did not allow elected bodies power. This resentment spurred republican ideals and sowed the seeds for early [[Canadian nationalism]]. Accordingly, rebellion in favour of [[responsible government]] rose in both regions; [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]] led the [[Lower Canada Rebellion]] and [[William Lyon Mackenzie]], first [[Toronto]] [[mayor]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Biography – MACKENZIE, WILLIAM LYON – Volume IX (1861–1870) |website=Dictionary of Canadian Biography |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/mackenzie_william_lyon_9E.html |access-date=October 25, 2018 |archive-date=January 5, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210105130202/http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/mackenzie_william_lyon_9E.html |url-status=live }}</ref> led the [[Upper Canada Rebellion]]. In [[Upper Canada]], the rebellion was quickly a failure. [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] escaped to the [[United States]], where he declared the [[Republic of Canada]] on [[Navy Island]] on the [[Niagara River]].<ref>{{cite web |title=William Lyon Mackenzie |website=The Canadian Encyclopedia |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/mackenzie-william-lyon |access-date=October 25, 2018 |archive-date=January 5, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210105130307/https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/mackenzie-william-lyon |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Canada West (1841–1867)===
{{Main|Canada West}}
Although both rebellions were put down in short order, the British government sent [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]] to investigate the causes. He recommended [[responsible government]] be granted, and Lower and Upper Canada be re-joined in an attempt to assimilate the [[French Canadians]]. Accordingly, the two colonies were merged into the Province of Canada by the ''[[Act of Union 1840]]'', with the capital initially at [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], and Upper Canada becoming known as [[Province of Canada|Canada West]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Canada West – historical region, Canada |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Canada-West |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=October 25, 2018 |archive-date=October 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025225854/https://www.britannica.com/place/Canada-West |url-status=live }}</ref> Responsible government was achieved in 1848. There were heavy waves of immigration in the 1840s, and the population of Canada West more than doubled by 1851 over the previous decade. As a result, for the first time, the English-speaking population of Canada West surpassed the French-speaking population of [[Canada East]], tilting the representative balance of power.
[[File:1855 Colton Map of Upper Canada or Ontario - Geographicus - Ontario2-colton-1855.jpg|thumb|left|Map of [[Canada West]] from 1855. Canada West formed the western portion of the [[Province of Canada]].]]
In 1849, the districts of southern Ontario were abolished by the [[Province of Canada]], and [[county]] governments took over certain municipal responsibilities. The Province of Canada also began creating ''districts'' in sparsely populated Northern Ontario with the establishment of [[Algoma District]] and [[Nipissing District]] in 1858.

An economic boom in the 1850s coincided with railway expansion across the province, further increasing the economic strength of Central Canada. With the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] and a reciprocity agreement in place with the United States, various industries such as timber, mining, farming and alcohol distilling benefited tremendously.

A political stalemate developed in the 1850s, between finely balanced political groups: conservative and reform groups from Canada West and Canada East aligned against reform and liberal groups from Canada East each group having some support from [[French-Canadian]] and English-Canadian  legislators.  There was also a fear of aggression from the United States during and immediately after the [[American Civil War]].  These factors led to the formation of the [[Great Coalition]] in the elected Legislative Assembly, which initiated a series of conferences in the 1860s to effect a broader federal union of all [[British North America]]n colonies. The ''[[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]]'' took effect on July 1, 1867, establishing the Dominion of Canada, initially with the four provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, and Ontario. The Province of Canada was divided into Ontario and Quebec so that each linguistic group would have its own province. Both Quebec and Ontario were required by section 93 of the ''British North America Act'' to safeguard existing educational rights and privileges of the Protestant and Catholic minorities. Thus, separate Catholic schools and [[board of education|school boards]] were permitted in Ontario. However, neither province had a constitutional requirement to protect its French- or English-speaking minority. Toronto was formally established as Ontario's provincial capital.

===Canadian province (1867–present)===
[[File:Canada provinces evolution 2.gif|thumb|An animated map of the changes to the borders of Canada. The borders of Ontario were last changed in 1912.]]
The borders of Ontario, its new name in 1867, were provisionally expanded north and west. When the Province of Canada was formed, its borders were not entirely clear, and Ontario claimed eventually to reach all the way to the [[Rocky Mountains]] and [[Arctic Ocean]]. With Canada's acquisition of Rupert's Land, Ontario was interested in clearly defining its borders, especially since some of the new areas in which it was interested were rapidly growing. After the federal government asked Ontario to pay for construction in the new disputed area, the province asked for an elaboration on its limits, and its boundary was moved north to the [[51st parallel north]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Report on the Boundaries of the Province of Ontario |author=Mills, David |publisher=Hunter, Rose & Co. |location=Toronto |page=347 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BlYCAAAAMAAJ |year=1877 |access-date=September 14, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107091048/http://books.google.com/books?id=BlYCAAAAMAAJ |archive-date=November 7, 2011 }}</ref>

[[File:Oliver Mowat.jpg|thumb|[[Oliver Mowat]], [[Premier of Ontario]] from 1872 to 1896]]
Once constituted as a province, Ontario proceeded to assert its economic and legislative power. In 1872, the lawyer [[Oliver Mowat]] became [[Premier of Ontario]] and remained as premier until 1896. He fought for provincial rights, weakening the power of the [[Government of Canada|federal government]] in provincial matters, usually through well-argued appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. His battles with the federal government greatly [[Decentralization|decentralized]] Canada, giving the provinces far more power than [[John A. Macdonald]] had intended. He consolidated and expanded Ontario's educational and provincial institutions, created districts in Northern Ontario, and fought to ensure that those parts of Northwestern Ontario not historically part of Upper Canada (the vast areas north and west of the Lake Superior-Hudson Bay watershed, known as the [[District of Keewatin]]) would become part of Ontario, a victory embodied in the ''Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889''. He also presided over the emergence of the province into the economic powerhouse of Canada. Mowat was the creator of what is often called ''Empire Ontario''.

Beginning with Macdonald's [[National Policy]] (1879) and the construction of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (1875–1885) through Northern Ontario and the [[Canadian Prairies]] to [[British Columbia]], Ontario manufacturing and industry flourished. However, population increases slowed after a large recession hit the province in 1893, thus slowing growth drastically but for only a few years. Many newly arrived immigrants and others moved west along the railway to the Prairie Provinces and British Columbia, sparsely settling Northern Ontario.

The northern and western boundaries of Ontario were in dispute after [[Canadian Confederation]]. Ontario's right to Northwestern Ontario was determined by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in 1884 and confirmed by the ''Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889'' of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. By 1899, there were seven northern districts: Algoma, Manitoulin, Muskoka, Nipissing, Parry Sound, Rainy River, and Thunder Bay. Four more northern districts were created between 1907 and 1912: Cochrane, Kenora, Sudbury and Timiskaming.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early Districts and Counties 1788–1899 |publisher=Archives of Ontario |date=September 5, 2006 |access-date=November 29, 2006 |url=https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/on-line-exhibits/maps/ontario-districts.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130162533/http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/on-line-exhibits/maps/ontario-districts.aspx |archive-date=January 30, 2010}}</ref>

[[Mineral]] exploitation accelerated in the late 19th century, leading to the rise of important mining centres in the northeast, such as [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Cobalt, Ontario|Cobalt]] and [[Timmins]]. The province harnessed its water power to generate hydro-electric power and created the state-controlled Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario, later [[Ontario Hydro]]. The availability of cheap electric power further facilitated the development of industry. The [[Ford Motor Company of Canada]] was established in 1904 and the [[McLaughlin Motor Car Company]] (later [[General Motors Canada]]) was founded in 1907. The motor vehicle industry became the most lucrative industry for the Ontario economy during the 20th century.

In July 1912, the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Conservative]] government of [[James Whitney (politician)|James Whitney]] issued [[Regulation 17]] which severely limited the availability of French-language schooling to the province's French-speaking minority. French Canadians reacted with outrage, journalist [[Henri Bourassa]] denouncing the "Prussians of Ontario". The regulation was eventually repealed in 1927.
[[File:Raid at elk lake.jpg|thumb|left|Law enforcement confiscate stores of alcohol in [[James, Ontario|Elk Lake]] in an effort to enforce [[prohibition]]. The prohibition measures were introduced in 1916 and were not repealed until 1927.]]
Influenced by events in the United States, the government of [[William Howard Hearst|William Hearst]] introduced [[Prohibition in Canada|prohibition]] of alcoholic drinks in 1916 with the passing of the ''[[Ontario Temperance Act]]''. However, residents could distil and retain their own personal supply, and liquor producers could continue distillation and export for sale, allowing this already sizeable industry to strengthen further. Ontario became a hotbed for the illegal smuggling of liquor and the biggest supplier into the United States, which was under complete [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]]. Prohibition in Ontario came to an end in 1927 with the establishment of the [[Liquor Control Board of Ontario]] under the government of [[Howard Ferguson]]. The sale and consumption of liquor, wine, and beer are still controlled by some of the most extreme laws in North America to ensure strict community standards and revenue generation from the alcohol retail monopoly are upheld.

The post-[[World War II]] period was one of exceptional prosperity and growth. Ontario has been the recipients of most immigration to Canada, largely immigrants from war-torn Europe in the 1950s and 1960s and following changes in federal [[immigration law]], a massive influx of non-Europeans since the 1970s. From a largely [[ethnic group|ethnically]] British province, Ontario has rapidly become culturally very diverse.

The nationalist movement in Quebec, particularly after the election of the ''[[Parti Québécois]]'' in 1976, contributed to driving many businesses and English-speaking people out of Quebec to Ontario, and as a result, Toronto surpassed [[Montreal]] as the largest city and economic centre of Canada.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mayda|first=Chris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzK0dFXtS9oC&q=1976+Toronto+surpassed+Montreal+as+the+largest+city+and+economic+centre+of+Canada&pg=PA109|title=A Regional Geography of the United States and Canada: Toward a Sustainable Future|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=2013|isbn=9780742556904|location=Lanham, Md.|page=109|access-date=October 19, 2020|archive-date=August 17, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210817055041/https://books.google.com/books?id=BzK0dFXtS9oC&q=1976+Toronto+surpassed+Montreal+as+the+largest+city+and+economic+centre+of+Canada&pg=PA109|url-status=live}}</ref> Depressed economic conditions in the [[Atlantic Canada|Maritime Provinces]] have also resulted in de-population of those provinces in the 20th century, with heavy migration into Ontario.<ref>Neill, R.

=== Population ===
In the [[2021 Canadian Census|2021 census]], Ontario had a population of 14,223,942 living in 5,491,201 of its 5,929,250 total dwellings, a 5.8 percent change from its 2016 population of 13,448,494. With a land area of {{convert|892411.76|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, it had a population density of {{Pop density|14223942|892411.76|km2|sqmi|prec=1}} in 2021.<ref name=StatCan2021/> The largest [[List of population centres in Ontario|population centres]] in Ontario are [[Toronto]], [[Ottawa]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]], [[London, Ontario|London]] and [[Oshawa]], which all have more than 300,000 inhabitants.

=== Ethnicity ===
{{Main|Demographics of Ontario#Ethnic origins}}
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2023}}
The percentages given below add to more than 100 per cent because of dual responses (e.g., "French and Canadian" response generates an entry both in the category "[[French Canadian]]" and in the category "Canadian").

The majority of Ontarians are of [[English Canadians|English]] or other [[European Canadians|European descent]] including large Scottish, Irish and Italian communities. Slightly less than 5 per cent of the population of Ontario is [[Franco-Ontarian]], that is those whose native tongue is French, although those with French ancestry account for 11 per cent of the population. Compared to natural increase or [[interprovincial migration in Canada|interprovincial migration]], [[Immigration to Canada|immigration]] is a huge population growth force in Ontario, as it has been over the last two centuries. More recent sources of immigrants with large or growing communities in Ontario include [[East Asian Canadians|East Asians]], [[South Asian Canadians|South Asians]], Caribbeans, Latin Americans, Europeans, and Africans. Most populations have settled in the larger urban centres.

=== Visible minorities and Indigenous peoples ===

An abundance of [[natural resource]]s, excellent transportation links to the North American heartland and the inland Great Lakes making ocean access possible via [[container ship]]s, have all contributed to making manufacturing the principal industry of the province, found mainly in the Golden Horseshoe region, which is the largest industrialized area in Canada, the southern end of the region being part of the North American [[Rust Belt]]. Important products include motor vehicles, iron, steel, food, electrical appliances, machinery, chemicals, and paper.

Ontario surpassed Michigan in car production, assembling more than 2,696,000 vehicles in 2004. Ontario has [[Chrysler]] plants in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and Bramalea, two [[General Motors|GM]] plants in Oshawa and one in Ingersoll, a [[Honda]] assembly plant in [[Alliston]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] plants in Oakville and St. Thomas and [[Toyota]] assembly plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. However, as a result of steeply declining sales, in 2005, [[General Motors]] announced massive layoffs at production facilities across North America, including two large GM plants in [[Oshawa]] and a [[Powertrain|drive train]] facility in [[St. Catharines]], that resulted in 8,000 job losses in Ontario alone. In 2006, [[Ford Motor Company]] announced between 25,000 and 30,000 layoffs phased until 2012; Ontario was spared the worst, but job losses were announced for the [[St. Thomas, Ontario|St Thomas]] facility and the [[Windsor Casting]] plant.

=== Agriculture ===
[[File:Waterloo, Canada (Unsplash v1ar8e1dOjg).jpg|Aerial view of farms in [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]]. A significant portion of the land in [[Southern Ontario]] is used as farmland.|thumb]]

Once the dominant industry, agriculture now uses a small percentage of the workforce. [[Massey Ferguson]], a [[Agricultural machinery|farm-implement]] manufacturer, was originally founded in the province in 1847, before eventually expanding internationally.<ref>{{cite web |title=Massey Ferguson Company a Canadian success |url=https://www.durhamregion.com/news/massey-ferguson-company-a-canadian-success/article_d54ef664-2d57-5a0d-98b0-27ae1453b235.html |website=Oshawa This Week |date=October 24, 2006 |access-date=2 June 2024}}</ref> As the following table shows, while the number of individual farms has steadily decreased and their overall size has shrunk at a lower rate, greater mechanization has supported increased supply to satisfy the ever-increasing demands of a growing population base; this has also meant a gradual increase in the total amount of land used for growing crops.
{{Ontario Farming Stats}}
[[File:Vineyard, Prince Edward County (4048276162).jpg|thumb|Vineyard, Prince Edward County]]
Common types of farms reported in the 2001 census include those for cattle, small grains and dairy. The fruit- and [[Ontario wine|wine industry]] is primarily on the [[Niagara Peninsula]], [[Prince Edward County Wine|Prince Edward County]], and along the northern shore of Lake Erie, where [[tobacco]] farms are also situated. Market vegetables grow in the rich soils of the [[Holland Marsh]] near [[Newmarket, Ontario|Newmarket]]. The area near [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] is also very fertile.

The area defined as the [[Corn Belt]] covers much of the southwestern area of the province, extending as far north as close to Goderich, but corn and soy are grown throughout the southern portion of the province. Apple orchards are a common sight along the southern shore of [[Nottawasaga Bay]] (part of Georgian Bay) near Collingwood and along the northern shore of Lake Ontario near Cobourg. Tobacco production, centred in [[Norfolk County, Ontario|Norfolk County]], has decreased, allowing an increase in alternative crops such as [[Corylus avellana|hazelnuts]] and [[ginseng]]. [[Southern Ontario]]'s limited supply of agricultural land is going out of production at an increasing rate. [[Urban sprawl]] and farmland [[Severance (land)|severances]] contribute to the loss of thousands of acres of productive agricultural land in Ontario each year. Over 2,000 farms and {{convert|150000|acre|abbr=on}} of farmland in the GTA alone were lost to production in the two decades between 1976 and 1996. This loss represented approximately 18%". of Ontario's Class 1 farmland being converted to urban purposes.

Despite its diverse range of power options, problems related to increasing consumption, lack of energy efficiency and ageing nuclear reactors, Ontario has been forced in recent years to purchase power from its neighbours Quebec and Michigan to supplement its power needs during peak consumption periods. Ontario's basic domestic rate in 2010 was 11.17 cents per kWh; by contrast.

The ''Green Energy and Green Economy Act'', 2009 (GEA), takes a two-pronged approach to commercializing renewable energy; first, it aims to bring more [[Renewable resource|renewable energy sources]] to the province; and secondly, it aims to adopt more [[efficient energy use|energy-efficiency]] measures to help [[energy conservation|conserve energy]]. The bill envisaged appointing a Renewable Energy Facilitator to provide "one-window" assistance and support to project developers to facilitate project approvals.<ref name="renewableenergyworld1">

The approvals process for transmission projects would also be [[wikt:streamline|streamlined]] and (for the first time in Ontario) the bill would enact standards for renewable energy projects.

[[File:Adam Beck Complex.jpg|thumb|The [[Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations]] are [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] plants located in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]].]]

Ontario is home to [[Niagara Falls]], which supplies a large amount of electricity to the province. The [[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station]], the second largest operational [[nuclear power]] plant in the world, is also in Ontario and uses 8 [[CANDU reactor]]s to generate electricity for the province.

Ontario had the most [[wind energy]] capacity of the country with 4,900 MW of power (41% of Canada's capacity).<ref>{{cite web |title=Renewable energy facts |url=https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/facts/renewable-energy/20069 |publisher=Canada Natural Resources |date=October 6, 2017 |access-date=October 25, 2018 |archive-date=October 22, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022232849/https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/facts/renewable-energy/20069 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Government, law and politics ==
{{Further|Monarchy in Ontario|Executive Council of Ontario|Local government in Ontario}}
The ''British North America Act 1867'' section 69 stipulated "There shall be a Legislature for Ontario consisting of the Lieutenant Governor and of One House, styled the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]." The assembly currently has 124 seats (increased from 107 as of the 42nd Ontario general election) representing [[electoral district (Canada)|ridings]] elected in a [[Plurality voting|first-past-the-post]] system across the province.

The legislative buildings at [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen's Park]] are the seat of government. Following the [[Westminster system]], the leader of the party holding the most seats in the assembly is known as the "Premier and President of the Council" (Executive Council Act R.S.O. 1990). The Premier chooses the [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] or [[Executive Council of Ontario|Executive Council]] whose members are deemed [[ministers of the Crown]].

Although the ''Legislative Assembly Act'' (R.S.O. 1990) refers to "members of the assembly" in English and {{lang|fr|députés à l'Assemblée}} in French, the legislators are now commonly called MPPs ([[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|Members of the Provincial Parliament]]) in English, but they have also been called MLAs ([[Member of the Legislative Assembly|Members of the Legislative Assembly]]); both are acceptable but the latter is uncommon. The title of Prime Minister of Ontario, correct in French ({{lang|fr|le Premier ministre}}), is permissible in English but now generally avoided in favour of the title "Premier" to avoid confusion with the Prime Minister of Canada.

=== Law ===

Ontario has grown, from its roots in [[Upper Canada]], into a modern jurisdiction. The old titles of the chief law officers, the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General, remain in use. They both are responsible to the Legislature. The Attorney-General draughts the laws and is responsible for criminal prosecutions and the administration of justice, while the Solicitor-General is responsible for law enforcement and the police services of the province. The ''[[Municipal Act]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_01m25_e.htm |website=Government of Ontario | title = ''Municipal Act, 2001'', S.O. 2001, c. 25| date = July 24, 2014| access-date = April 23, 2019| archive-date = March 30, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330230859/http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_01m25_e.htm| url-status = live}}</ref> is the main [[statute]] governing the creation, administration and government of [[municipality|municipalities]] in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of Ontario, other than the [[City of Toronto government|City of Toronto]].

=== Politics ===
{{Main|Politics of Ontario}}
[[File:Ontario Legislative Building, Toronto, South view 20170417 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Ontario Legislative Building]] at [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen's Park]]. The building serves as the meeting place for the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]].]]
Ontario has numerous political parties which run for election. The four main parties are the centre-right [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario]], the [[Social democracy|social democratic]] [[Ontario New Democratic Party]] (NDP), the centre to centre-left [[Ontario Liberal Party]], and [[Green Party of Ontario]]. The Progressive Conservatives, Liberals and New Democrats have each governed the province, while the Greens elected their first member to the Legislative Assembly in [[2018 Ontario general election|2018]].

The [[2018 Ontario general election|2018 provincial election]] resulted in a Progressive Conservative majority government under party leader [[Doug Ford]], who was sworn in as [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]] on June 29. Ontario NDP leader Andrea Horwath was sworn in as the leader of her Majesty's Loyal Opposition.

===Administrative divisions===
[[File:Ontario census divisions by type.png|thumb|275px|alt=Ontario's census divisions by type from the 2011 federal census|Map of the counties, regional municipalities, districts, and municipalities of Ontario.]]

Ontario has three types of [[List of census divisions of Ontario|first-level administrative divisions]]. They include [[List of census divisions of Ontario#Single-tier municipalities|single-tier municipalities]], upper-tier municipalities (which may be in the form of either [[List of regional municipalities in Ontario|regional municipalities]] or [[United counties|counties]]), and [[Districts of Ontario|district]]s. Upper-tier municipalities and districts are made up of smaller municipalities and other types of administrative divisions.

Administrative divisions differ primarily in the services that they provide to their residents, with the differing structures of these administrative regions resulting in disparities among Ontario's different regions. The administrative regions of Ontario are roughly coterminous with the [[List of census divisions of Ontario|census divisions]] used by [[Statistics Canada]], although some exceptions do exist.{{notetag|[[Statistics Canada]] treats [[Norfolk County, Ontario|Norfolk County]] and [[Haldimand County]] as one single census division; the [[County of Brant]] and [[Brantford|City of Brantford]] are also treated as one single census division. There would otherwise be 51 census divisions instead of the 49 official ones used by Statistics Canada.|name=Haldimand-Norfolk|group=lower-alpha}}

=== Urban areas ===
{{See also|Golden Horseshoe|National Capital Region (Canada)|Detroit–Windsor}}
Statistics Canada's measure of a "metro area", the [[Census Metropolitan Area]] (CMA), roughly bundles together population figures from the core municipality with those from "commuter" municipalities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Population and dwelling counts, for Canada, provinces and territories, census metropolitan areas and census agglomerations, 2006 and 2001 censuses – 100% data|publisher=Statistics Canada|date=November 5, 2008|access-date=April 1, 2009|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/popdwell/Table.cfm?T=202&PR=35&S=0&O=A&RPP=50|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504145258/http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/popdwell/Table.cfm?T=202&PR=35&S=0&O=A&RPP=50|archive-date=May 4, 2009}}</ref>
