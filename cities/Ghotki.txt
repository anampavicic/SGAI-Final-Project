== Law and order situation ==
The district of Ghotki is facing a serious law and order issue with numerous incidents daily of kidnappings, murders, and robberies. The challenging aspect of the problem is that these incidents are occurring in remote "kutcha areas" (riverine areas) with difficult-to-access routes.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-03-10 |title=‘Operation clean-up’ in kutcha areas on cards |url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/2405311/operation-clean-up-in-kutcha-areas-on-cards |access-date=2023-03-15 |website=The Express Tribune |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Ali |first=Imtiaz |date=2022-12-27 |title=Sindh police to add eyes in the sky to combat outlaws in riverine areas |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1728423 |access-date=2023-03-15 |website=DAWN.COM |language=en}}</ref>

The cabinet approved the proposal for the procurement of military-grade weapons and surveillance systems worth Rs2.79 billion to combat kidnapping and attacks on police forces in the riverine areas of Ghotki, Shikarpur, and Sukkur districts.The Home department was directed to seek an NOC from the Ministry of Interior for the purchase.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Web Desk |date=2023-01-07 |title=Sindh police seek billions for operation against dacoits in Katcha areas |url=https://arynews.tv/sindh-police-seek-billions-for-operation-against-dacoits-in-katcha-areas/ |access-date=2023-03-15 |website=ARY NEWS |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-11-28 |title=Sindh govt vows to wipe out dacoit culture |url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/2388627/sindh-govt-vows-to-wipe-out-dacoit-culture |access-date=2023-03-15 |website=The Express Tribune |language=en}}</ref> The Sindh police planned to procure drone technology to use the unmanned aerial vehicles not only for surveillance but also for targeting bandits in riverine areas of the province.

Outlaws found safe havens in the difficult terrain of four hard-to-reach districts - Ghotki, Sukkur, Shikarpur, and Kashmore. Drones were previously used by the army during Zarb-i-Azab, but now law enforcement agencies use them extensively in counter-terrorism and to combat urban terrorism. This marks a major shift in operational techniques used by law enforcement agencies, including the Counter-Terrorism Department.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-07-23 |title=Law and order situation in Ghotki |url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/644616/law-and-order-situation-in-ghotki/ |access-date=2023-03-15 |website=Daily Times |language=en-US}}</ref>
