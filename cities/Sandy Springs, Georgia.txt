'''Sandy Springs''' is a city in northern [[Fulton County, Georgia]], United States, and a suburb of [[Atlanta]]. The city's population was 108,080 at the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]],<ref name="QuickFacts">{{cite web |title=QuickFacts: Sandy Springs city, Georgia |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/sandyspringscitygeorgia/POP010220 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |access-date=October 15, 2021}}</ref> making it [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]'s [[List of municipalities in Georgia (U.S. state)|7th most populous city]]. It is the site of several corporate headquarters, including [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], [[Newell Brands]], [[Inspire Brands]], [[Focus Brands]], [[Cox Enterprises]], and [[Mercedes-Benz USA]]'s corporate offices.

==History==
Human settlement in the area can be traced back to approximately 400 CE, when Native Americans forged three trails to better access the area's freshwater springs.<ref name="history2" /> In the 16th century, the [[Muscogee|Creek Muskogee]] tribe settled the area, where they remained until the early 1800s, when they were forced out of the area due to the discovery of [[gold]].<ref name="history2" />

In 1821, the federal government held a number of land lotteries in the area, resulting in the purchase of land in present-day Sandy Springs and its subsequent settlement.<ref name="history2" /> The Austin-Johnson House, the oldest existing unaltered house, was built in 1842 on what is now Johnson Ferry Road.<ref name="history2">{{cite web|title=Sandy Springs GA History|url=http://www.sandysprings.com/history.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729135902/http://www.sandysprings.com/history.aspx|archive-date=2010-07-29|access-date=2020-06-14|work=SandySprings.com}}</ref> In 1851, Wilson Spruill donated {{convert|5|acre}} of land for the founding of Sandy Springs [[United Methodist Church]], near the natural spring for which the city is named.<ref name="history2b">{{cite web |title=Sandy Springs GA History |url=https://www.visitsandysprings.org/why-sandy-springs/history/Visit |access-date=2022-03-03 |work=visitsandysprings.org}}</ref> In 1905, the Hammond School was built at [[Historic ferries of the Atlanta area|Johnson Ferry]] Road and Mt. Vernon Highway, across the street from the church.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

=== 20th century ===

In 1950, the state legislature blocked Atlanta from annexing the community, which remained rural until the Interstate Highway System was authorized by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956. In 1959, after a fire at Hammond Elementary School, [[William Hartsfield]], the mayor of Atlanta, urged residents to support annexation so that the area would have better firefighting protection. Community opposition killed the proposal. In the early 1960s, [[Georgia 400]] and [[Interstate 285 (Georgia)|Interstate 285]] were constructed, connecting Sandy Springs to [[metro Atlanta]] and initiating a housing boom that brought new residents and major [[land development]] as part of the [[white flight]] from Atlanta after the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]] won greater racial integration within Atlanta.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book |title=White flight : Atlanta and the making of modern conservatism |last=Kruse |first=Kevin Michael |date=2007 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9781400848973 |location=Princeton, N.J. |oclc=852159650}}</ref>

In 1965, Hartsfield once again proposed the annexation of the Sandy Springs area. Spokesmen for Sandy Springs promised residents to "build up a city separate from Atlanta and your Negroes and forbid any Negroes to buy, or own, or live within our limits" should they reject annexation.<ref name=":5" /> In 1966, annexation by Atlanta was defeated in a referendum, with two-thirds voting against.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Efforts to incorporate Sandy Springs began in 1966 in response to attempts by the city of Atlanta to annex this unincorporated area of north [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=City History |url=https://www.sandyspringsga.gov/city-history/ |access-date=2024-06-28 |website=www.sandyspringsga.gov |language=en-US}}</ref>

In the early 1970s, the city of Atlanta attempted to use a state law to force [[annexation]] of Sandy Springs, which failed after the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]] ruled that the law was [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. In response, a group of residents formed the Committee for Sandy Springs 1975 to lobby for the incorporation of Sandy Springs.<ref name="history2" />

During this time, proponents for an incorporated Sandy Springs argued that their taxes were disproportionately going to other, largely non-white, communities in Fulton County.<ref name=":6">{{Cite news|last=Rosen|first=Sam|date=2017-04-26|title=Atlanta's Controversial 'Cityhood' Movement|work=The Atlantic|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/04/the-border-battles-of-atlanta/523884/|url-status=live|access-date=2020-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200614220951/https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/04/the-border-battles-of-atlanta/523884/|archive-date=2020-06-14|issn=1072-7825}}</ref> In every legislative session, state legislators representing the area introduced a bill in the [[Georgia General Assembly]] to authorize a referendum on incorporation.<ref name="history2" /> Legislators representing Atlanta and southwestern Fulton County, who feared that tax revenue would be lost from incorporation, blocked the bills,<ref name="history2" /> using the procedural requirement that all [[local legislation]] be approved first by a delegation of representatives from the affected area.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

In 1991, the Georgia state government determined that Sandy Springs, along with other wealthier, and predominantly white, communities in Fulton County was being taxed below statewide minimums, resulting in an increase in taxes for the area.<ref name=":6" /> Some Sandy Springs residents, including [[Mitch Skandalakis]], launched a number of campaigns against the taxes, and launched an unsuccessful lawsuit against the state.<ref name=":6" />

On January 16, 1997, [[Eric Rudolph]] bombed an abortion clinic in Sandy Springs.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Bragg|first=Rick|date=1997-01-17|title=2 Bomb Blasts Rock Abortion Clinic at Atlanta; 6 Are Injured|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/17/us/2-bomb-blasts-rock-abortion-clinic-at-atlanta-6-are-injured.html|access-date=2020-06-12|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Bonvillian|first=Crystal|date=2018-03-19|title=Serial bomber Eric Rudolph targeted Olympics, gay club, abortion clinics|url=https://www.ajc.com/news/national/serial-bomber-eric-rudolph-targeted-olympics-gay-clubs-abortion-clinics/2Pm8Uoj3XucMLRowsheGtL/|access-date=2020-06-12|website=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|language=en}}</ref>

=== 21st century ===
When the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] gained a majority in both houses of the [[Georgia General Assembly]] in 2005, the procedural rules previously used to prevent a vote by the full chamber were changed so that the bill was handled as a state bill and not as a local bill.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} The assembly also repealed the requirement that new cities must be at least {{convert|3|mi}} from existing cities that had stymied previous attempts to incorporate due to Sandy Springs directly bordering both [[Roswell, Georgia|Roswell]] and Atlanta.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} The bill allowing for a referendum on incorporation was introduced and passed as HB 37.<ref name="hb37">{{cite web |url=http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/2005_06/fulltext/hb37.htm |title=Georgia General Assembly - House Bill 37 |access-date=July 27, 2010 |publisher=Georgia General Assembly |author1=Wilkinson, Joe |author2=Willard, Wendell |author3=Geisinger, Harry |author4=Lindsey, Edward |year=2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730033709/http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/2005_06/fulltext/hb37.htm |archive-date=July 30, 2010 }}</ref> The referendum initiative was approved by the Assembly and signed by Governor [[Sonny Perdue]].

{{Citation needed span|text=Many residents expressed displeasure with county services, claiming, based upon financial information provided by the county, that the county was redistributing revenues to fund services in less financially stable areas of the county, ignoring local opposition to rezoning, and allowing excessive development. Many residents of unincorporated and less-developed south Fulton County strongly opposed incorporation, fearing the loss of tax revenues which fund county services. County residents outside Sandy Springs were not allowed to vote on the matter. Efforts such as requesting the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] to reject the plan were unsuccessful.|date=June 2020|reason=}}

The referendum was held on June 21, 2005, and residents voted 94% in favor of incorporation.<ref name="history2" /> In November 2005, voters returned to the polls to elect a [[mayor]] and six [[city council]] members.

Formal incorporation occurred on December 1, making Sandy Springs the third-largest city ever to incorporate in the U.S.<ref name="history1" /> The city's police force and fire department began service in 2006. Upon incorporation, Sandy Springs initiated a nontraditional approach by operating as a [[Publicâ€“private partnership|public-private partnership]] (PPP), with all but six full-time employees being contracted.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Paterson|first=Blake|date=2019-09-19|title=Why Sandy Springs, Georgia &ndash; once a model for St. George &ndash; has abandoned privatization|url=https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/article_f979bb02-db0d-11e9-a663-4f9805a3c075.html|access-date=2020-06-12|website=The Advocate|language=en}}</ref>

In 2010, the city undertook a procurement process to rebid all general city services, which was won by [[CH2M Hill]].<ref name=":0" /> The timing of this contract, during the [[Great Recession]], allowed the city to leverage a cheaper contract due to the economic downturn.<ref name=":0" />

In 2010, the city became the first jurisdiction in Georgia to successfully "bail out" from the preclearance requirements of [[Voting Rights Act of 1965#Section 5 - Preclearance|Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act]].<ref>{{cite web|date=September 22, 2010|title=U.S. Reaches Agreements with Kings Mountain, N.C., and Sandy Springs, Ga., to Terminate Coverage from Preclearance of the Voting Rights Act|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/September/10-crt-1067.html|access-date=December 18, 2012|work=Justice.gov}}</ref>

In 2019, the Sandy Springs City Council moved to scale back the PPP model, directly hiring 183 contract employees, leaving only 15 outsourced full-time workers by the end of 2019.<ref name=":1" /> The city will still outsource a number of services, including the city attorney's office, as well as security, street sweeping and ambulance services.<ref name=":1" /> The move was expected to save $2.7 million in the next year and more than $14 million over 5 years.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{cite news|url=https://www.ajc.com/news/local/sandy-springs-first-cityhood-changes-how-does-business/cRX2YPFDVzWgUtNE7c4h9L/|title=Sandy Springs, First in Cityhood, Changes How it Does Business|newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=May 17, 2019|author=Arielle Kass, Ben Brasch|access-date=May 22, 2019}}</ref>

==Geography==
The boundaries of Sandy Springs are Atlanta to the south, [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb County]] (at the [[Chattahoochee River]]) to the west and north, [[Roswell, Georgia|Roswell]] (also at the river) to the north, and [[Dunwoody, Georgia|Dunwoody]] and [[Brookhaven, Georgia|Brookhaven]], at the [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]] line, to the east. A small [[salient (geography)|panhandle]] in the northeast extends between the Chattahoochee River to the north and Dunwoody to the south, ending in a very small border with [[Peachtree Corners, Georgia|Peachtree Corners]] in the extreme western edge of [[Gwinnett County, Georgia|Gwinnett County]].

===Climate===
Sandy Springs has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[KÃ¶ppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''). During January and February 2014, the Atlanta area, including Sandy Springs, experienced a [[January 2014 Gulf Coast winter storm|severe snow storm]] and a [[Mid-February 2014 North American winter storm|severe ice storm]], both of which left much of the region without power, caused major travel disruptions, and the former storm forced people to take shelter in cars and schools as the city was underprepared for the black ice that prevented transport.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jamieson|first=Alastair|date=2014-02-12|title='Catastrophic' ice storm hits Atlanta, threatening power lines|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2014/02/12/catastrophic-ice-storm-hits-atlanta-threatening-power-lines.html|access-date=2020-06-12|website=CNBC|language=en}}</ref>

==== Downtownâ€”City Springs====
City Springs, the downtown district of Sandy Springs, is usually defined as the area to the south and east of Sandy Springs Circle, to the north of [[Interstate 285 (Georgia)|Interstate 285]], and to the west of Boylston Drive. It is located approximately 12 miles directly north of [[Downtown Atlanta]]. In the absence of a traditional downtown, city leaders created City Springs, a multi-use development containing municipal offices, residential, retail, green space and a performing arts center, landmarking a formal "downtown" for its residents.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|date=2018-07-08|title=City Springs complex anchors new downtown for Sandy Springs|url=https://www.ajc.com/news/local/city-springs-complex-anchors-new-downtown-for-sandy-springs/bLQt6lGs3aQ4AqDiWfnRDO/|access-date=2020-06-12|website=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|language=en}}</ref> City leaders purchased the property in 2008, which was once the site of a former Target (formerly Richway) shopping center,{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} located between Roswell Road, Johnson Ferry Road, and Mount Vernon Highway. Since then, the surrounding area in the district has become a center for urban renewal for the city, with many new mixed-use apartment developments being planned or built, primarily replacing old [[strip malls]] along [[Roswell Road]]. The City Springs center officially opened in 2018, 10 years after the original site purchase.<ref name=":2" /> The official address for the complex is on Galambos Way, named after the city's first mayor, [[Eva Galambos]].<ref name=":2" /> Within the City Springs district is Heritage Green, which is home to the spring which spurred the name of the city.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

==== Riverside ====
Riverside is the western district of the city, located south of Dalyrmple Road and west of Roswell Road, bordering the Chattahoochee River to the west, forming the western border with Cobb County. It is a high-income, residential area marked by winding, hilly roads and old growth forest. The main roads are Heards Ferry Road and Riverside Drive, and it is located off the Riverside Drive exit of I-285. Two of the public schools within Sandy Springs are located here, Heards Ferry Elementary and [[Riverwood International Charter School]]. The headquarters for the [[Fulton County Board of Education]] are also found in this district.

{{Anchor|Dunwoody Panhandle}}

==== The Panhandle ====
The Dunwoody Panhandle, or just "The Panhandle" is a residential area bounded by the [[Dunwoody, Georgia|Dunwoody]] city limit to the south, the Chattahoochee River to the north, [[Georgia State Route 400|Georgia 400]] to the west, and Peachtree Corners city limit to the east. The district's name is derived from the fact that it is wedged between the river and Dunwoody, forming a geographic panhandle. Major roads include Dunwoody Club Drive and [[Spalding Drive]], and Interstate access is through the Northridge Road exit of Georgia 400. Many who lived in the neighborhood during Sandy Springs' incorporation considered themselves part of Dunwoody, and voiced their opposition to the installment of street sign toppers labelled "Sandy Springs".<ref name=":3">{{cite web|date=July 25, 2006|title=Sandy Springs vetoes Dunwoody toppers - Dunwoody Crier: Local News|url=http://thecrier.net/articles/2006/07/25/news/sign.txt|access-date=December 18, 2012|publisher=Thecrier.net}}</ref> Then-mayor Eva Galambos stated that these new signs would do nothing to diminish the neighborhood's identity.<ref name=":3" /> Some residents still consider the area to be "Dunwoody in Sandy Springs", similar to the [[Buckhead Community]] district of Atlanta.

==== Perimeter Center ====
[[Perimeter Center]] is a commercial [[edge city]] and [[business district]] surrounding [[Perimeter Mall]]. Although about 40% of Perimeter Center, including the mall, is located in Dunwoody, the western 60%, including most of the area's [[office building|office tower]]s, are located in Sandy Springs. [[Pill Hill (Atlanta)|Pill Hill]] is located in the Sandy Springs section of Perimeter Center, and is the largest medical center in Georgia. It includes [[Northside Hospital]], [[Saint Joseph's Hospital (Atlanta)|St. Joseph's Hospital]], and [[Children's Healthcare of Atlanta]]. More than 40% of the hospital beds in the metro area are located within Sandy Springs. Landmarks include Hammond Park, [[Concourse at Landmark Center]], colloquially called the 'King' and 'Queen' buildings due to their distinct white crown architecture at the top of each tower, as well as two [[MARTA]] stations, the [[Sandy Springs station|Sandy Springs]] and [[Medical Center station (MARTA)|Medical Center]] [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|MARTA]] [[metro station|stations]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.perimetercid.org/about.html| title=About Perimeter CIDs - Perimeter Community Improvement Districts| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://archive.today/20120906162835/http://www.perimetercid.org/about.html| archive-date=September 6, 2012}}</ref> The area also includes the 400-285 highway interchange, which is currently undergoing major construction.

Sandy Springs was noted for contracting private companies to perform the majority of its services in a public-private partnership model of government at the beginning of its incorporation in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Feine|first1=Paul|title=Sandy Springs, Georgia: The city that outsourced everything|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8qFvo2qJOU| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/f8qFvo2qJOU| archive-date=2021-12-11 | url-status=live|department=ReasonTV|publisher=Reason Foundation|access-date=December 29, 2017}}{{cbignore}}</ref> While many governments contract with private-sector companies on a per-project basis, Sandy Springs is believed to be the first American city to outsource its services for the majority of ongoing operations. They chose to do so as an economic response to the [[Great Recession]]. The city regularly hosted delegations from other governments that were interested in the model.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/business/a-georgia-town-takes-the-peoples-business-private.html |title=A Georgia Town Takes the People's Business Private|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 23, 2012|first=David|last=Segal}}</ref> Services not outsourced include police, fire-rescue, and city management. The city moved away from the private-public partnership model in 2019 when it was realized how much money was lost to private contractors and hired 184 full-time city staff that work at the new City Springs development. It now operates as a hybrid model, outsourcing projects to private companies as needed. The city estimates $14 million will be saved over the next five years from hiring full-time staff.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.sandyspringsga.gov/public-private-partnership|title=Public Private Partnership|date=2022-03-03}}</ref>

The Sandy Springs Police Department (SSPD) is the city's police department<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sandy Springs Police Department |url=https://www.sandyspringsgapolice.gov/ |access-date=}}</ref> and took over services from Fulton County on July 1, 2006, with 86 original police officers recruited from various police agencies from all over the State of Georgia. The department currently has an authorized staff of 149 full-time sworn officers and 11 part-time officers. Additionally, the SSPD also employs 23 civilian staff members who handle duties such as records, permits, GCIC, and fleet maintenance. The current Executive Officer is Chief Kenneth DeSimone, who assumed the position in 2013 from Terry Sult, who replaced Gene Wilson in 2008 as the department's first chief. The department answered 124,374 calls for service and made 3,390 arrests in 2020.

Dedicated units of the SSPD include Uniform Patrol, Bike Unit, Community Affairs, Crime Scene Investigations, Criminal Investigation Division, Criminal Intelligence Unit, Crisis Negotiation Team, Honor Guard, K-9 Unit, Quick Response Force, Special Investigation Unit, Swift Water Rescue Team, Traffic Unit, and the Training Unit. Further, the SSPD is a member of the North Metro SWAT Team, consisting of officers from Sandy Springs Police Department, Dunwoody Police Department, Johns Creek Police Department, and the Brookhaven Police Department. The SSPD headquarters is located at 7840 Roswell Road, Suite 301, within the Morgan Falls Office Park.

The city's fire department began operations in December 2006. The department consists of 97 full-time firefighters. Chief Jack McElfish headed the fire department from 2005 to 2014. The fire department is today{{When|date=July 2023}} led by Chief Keith Sanders. It is staffed by 113 full-time firefighters. The fire department handled 17,000 responses to 8,205 calls for service

==Infrastructure==

===Major roads and expressways===
Sandy Springs is served by two major limited-access [[highway]]s: Georgia 400, which runs northâ€“south, and I-285, which runs eastâ€“west. Major surface streets include Roswell Road ([[United States Highway 19|U.S. 19]] south of I-285 and [[Georgia State Route 9|Georgia 9]] entirely), Hammond Drive, [[Spalding Drive]], Johnson Ferry Road, Abernathy Road, Glenridge Drive, and Dunwoody Club Drive.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

[[Roswell Road]] is considered the "[[main street]]" of the city, with a majority of residents living within 2 miles of the corridor. It connects [[Roswell, Georgia|Roswell]] at the Chattahoochee River to the north into the Atlanta neighborhood of Buckhead to the south. It runs through the heart of Downtown Sandy Springs, with the City Springs complex being located on the highway.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

Recently completed major road projects include the widening of Abernathy Road between Johnson Ferry and Roswell Roads from two lanes to four plus a [[road median]]. The western intersection has been reconfigured so that traffic to and from Johnson Ferry Road âˆ’ which carries heavy loads of Cobb County commuters across the Chattahoochee River at [[rush hour]]{{snd}}now flows directly with Abernathy to and from the northwest. Additionally, the Roswell Road bridge over I-285 has been widened to add a turn lane in each direction. There had previously been talk of a tunnel under the [[freeway]] to bypass the [[highway interchange]] altogether, however this proved to be much too expensive. Another state project is the addition of a [[half-diamond interchange]] to Georgia 400 on the north side of Hammond Drive, allowing southbound traffic to exit and northbound traffic to enter the highway. (Ramps on the south side were not possible due to the proximity of the 400/285 interchange.)

The city's [[public works]] department has made improvements in the conditions of roads and traffic signals since incorporation in December 2005. The department has cleaned approximately 1,500 [[catch basin]]s, striped {{convert|30|mi|km}} of roadway, responded to more than 2,000 calls for repair and service, re-timed hundreds of traffic lights to help improve the flow of traffic and reduce automobile [[Idle (engine)|idling]], and repaved {{convert|60|mi|abbr=on}} of roads.

The 2008 [[fiscal year]] saw the creation of the Sandy Springs Traffic Management Center (TMC). The TMC was constructed and began to operate in less than six months. Construction began in February 2008, five [[traffic camera|cameras viewed traffic]] along Roswell Road by the end of June. Special features of the TMC include a webpage that allows the public access to real-time traffic conditions and [[voice-activated]] controls. By June 2009, 16 traffic cameras are now available and can be viewed online at the city's website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sandyspringsga.org/City-Departments/Public-Works/Capital-Improvement-Projects|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129010045/http://www.sandyspringsga.org/City-Departments/Public-Works/Capital-Improvement-Projects|url-status=dead|title=Capital Improvement Projects|archive-date=January 29, 2011}}</ref>

===Mass transit===
The major provider of [[mass transit]] is [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|MARTA]], which operates a [[heavy rail]] [[rapid transit]] line and several bus lines through Sandy Springs. The city is served by the [[Medical Center (MARTA station)|Medical Center]], [[Sandy Springs (MARTA station)|Sandy Springs]] and [[North Springs (MARTA station)|North Springs]] stations. The [[Georgia Regional Transportation Authority]] also operates express buses from the North Springs station (which has its own ramps to and from 400) to other counties.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

===Pedestrians and cycling===
Currently the city is limited in multi-use trails, but bike lanes can be found in certain parts of the city. The city is currently working on creating more trails and bike lanes. Currently, the Abernathy Greenway is a popular multi-use trail running adjacent to Abernathy Road, connecting to Abernathy Park. The [[PATH400]] Greenway Trail is a multi-use trail running along the [[Georgia 400]] freeway in the Buckhead district of Atlanta. Sandy Springs is currently in the early stages of planning an extension of the trail through the city north into Roswell. Once complete, it would run from the northern border of Sandy Springs to the Atlanta [[BeltLine]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patch.com/georgia/buckhead/first-phase-of-path400-to-break-ground-feb-17|title=First Phase of PATH400 to Break Ground Feb. 17|date=February 13, 2014|website=Buckhead, GA Patch}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reporternewspapers.net/2017/10/25/consultants-present-early-plan-path400-extension-sandy-springs/|title=Consultants present early plan for PATH400 extension to Sandy Springs|date=October 25, 2017|website=reporternewspapers.net}}</ref> As well, the city is working with the [[Georgia Department of Transportation]] to transform the city's portion of [[Roswell Road]] into a more pedestrian and transit friendly corridor. The city council came under fire in 2021 after two separate tragic hit-and-run accidents killed both a pedestrian and his dog and a cycler near downtown Sandy Springs.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.ajc.com/news/traffic/breaking-pedestrian-hit-killed-roswell-road-sandy-springs/PXMvzQLfJcOPda8X5NWNhJ/ |title= Bicyclist killed by DUI driver was on the way to work, police say|newspaper= The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|first= Chelsea|last= Prince}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.ajc.com/news/police-woman-fleeing-hit-and-run-hits-kills-sandy-springs-man-walking-dog/YEVZOP5S2BD3PCJDX2XHN2N2RM/ |title=Police Woman Fleeing Hit and Run Hits Sandy Springs Man Walking|newspaper= The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|first= Henri|last= Hollis}}</ref>
