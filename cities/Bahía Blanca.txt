'''Bahía Blanca''' ({{IPA|es|baˈi.a ˈβlaŋka}}; English: ''White Bay'') is a city by the [[Atlantic Ocean]], in the southwest [[Buenos Aires Province|province of Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. It is the seat of government of the [[Bahía Blanca Partido]], with 301,572 inhabitants according to the {{census-ar|2010}}. Bahía Blanca is the principal city in the [[Greater Bahía Blanca]] area.

The city has an important seaport with a depth of {{cvt|15|m}}, kept constant upstream almost all along the length of the bay, where the [[Napostá Stream]] drains.

''Bahía Blanca'' means "White Bay". The name is due to the color of the salt covering the local soil surrounding the shores. The bay (which is an [[estuary]]) was seen by [[Ferdinand Magellan]] during his first circumnavigation of the world on the order of [[Charles I of Spain]] in 1520, looking for a canal connecting the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean along the coasts of South America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www7.uc.cl/sw_educ/historia/expansion/HTML/p350h.html|title=La primera circunnavegación de la tierra|trans-title=The first circumnavigation of the world|access-date=23 July 2015|language=es|publisher=[[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/FichaObra.html?Ref=8102&portal=24|title=Descripción de Patagonia y de las partes adyacentes de la América meridional, que contiene una razón del suelo, producciones, animales, valles, montañas, ríos, lagunas... / escrita en inglés por Tomas Falkner, que residió cerca de 40 años en aquellas partes |access-date=23 July 2015|language=es|first=Tomas|last= Falkner|website=Cervantesvirtual.com|trans-title=Description of Patagonia and adjacent parts of South America, which contains a ratio of soil, production, animals, valleys, mountains, rivers, ponds... / written in English by Tomas Falkner, who lived about 40 years in those parts}}</ref>

==Foundation==
The city was founded as a fortress on 11 April 1828 by Colonel [[Ramón Estomba]] on the orders of [[Brigadier-General]] and subsequent Governor of Buenos Aires, [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]]. It was initially named ''Fortaleza Protectora Argentina'' (Argentine Protective Fortress), built for the purpose of protecting inhabitants from cattle rustlers, and also to guard the coast against the [[Brazil]]ian navy, which had landed in the area the previous year. It was visited by [[Charles Darwin]] during his travels through South America in September 1833. The fortress was attacked by ''[[Malón|Malones]]'' (incursions of nomadic aboriginals on horseback) several times, most notably in 1859 by 3,000 [[Calfucurá]] warriors. It became commercially important after the [[Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway]] linked the town to the city of [[Buenos Aires]] in 1885, facilitating the transport of grain from the [[Pampa]]s. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}
[[File:Immigrants.jpg|thumb|left|European immigrants in gaucho attire taking their children to an Argentine school, 1940]]

The rapid growth of the local economy, the policy encouraging [[immigration in Argentina|immigration]] from Europe, and the country's abundant natural resources attracted many immigrants, mainly from Spain and Italy, and a remarkable number from France, who settled in [[Pigüé]], about 125&nbsp;km to the north of the city. Another important foreign settlement close to the city was of Dutch settlers, in [[Tres Arroyos]], located about 250&nbsp;km northeast. Major groups of immigrants from Germany and Jews from Eastern Europe also arrived in the city and the region at the beginning of the 20th century,{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} as well as during World War II and the post-war period.

European immigrants brought their customs and culture. There were at least five opera houses in Bahía Blanca at the beginning of the 20th century and six cinemas by 1920. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

[[Puerto Belgrano]], located 29&nbsp;km to the southeast, is Argentina's largest naval base. Its construction started with a secret decree signed by Argentine President [[José Evaristo Uriburu]]. It was designed and built from 12 May 1898 to 8 March 1902 by an Italian engineer [[Luigi Luiggi]], and a Dutch company named Dirks, Dates & Van Hattem (detailed in the History of Puerto Belgrano).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.histarmar.com.ar/Armada%20Argentina/BNPB-Indice.htm |website=Histarmar.com.ar|title=BREVE HISTORIA DE LA BASE NAVAL DE PUERTO BELGRANO - Indice|trans-title=BRIEF HISTORY OF THE NAVAL BASE OF PUERTO BELGRANO - Index|access-date=23 July 2015|language=es}}</ref>

==Governance==
The municipal government of Bahia Blanca Partido includes the mayor, in charge of the executive branch, the city council, and the local legislation, approval and audit of the municipal budget, and a local Judiciary System, in charge of administering justice on behalf of the city regarding all the aspects of municipal legislation. The mayor and the members of the council are elected by direct vote, while the municipal judges are appointed. The mayor appoints the members of his cabinet of Secretaries who can be summoned by the council to whom they are mainly accountable.

A local political crisis in March 2006 resulted in the mayor's request for leave, which was granted by the city council on 27 March 2006. The mayor was indicted, and the case continued in the local judiciary. The president of the city council then took over as interim mayor. However, on 24 August 2006, the city council decided, for the first time in the history of the city, to unseat the elected mayor. With the approval of the supreme court of the Buenos Aires Province, the interim mayor and former president of the city council was appointed to complete his predecessor's term.<ref name="lanacion2006">{{cite news|url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/834362-destituyeron-al-intendente-de-bahia-blanca |title= Destituyeron al intendente de Bahía Blanca |publisher= [[La Nación]] |date=24 August 2006 |access-date= 8 December 2015}}</ref>

==Economy==

Bahía Blanca is an important trans-shipping and commercial center, handling the large export trade of grains and wool from the southern area of Buenos Aires Province, oil from [[Neuquén Province]], and fruit from the [[Río Negro (Argentina)|Río Negro]] Valley. Its group of seaports is one of the most important in the country as the only ones that are naturally {{cvt|10|m}} deep, although the depth of the main channel is kept at {{cvt|12.19|m|0}} by regular maintenance. Along the northeastern shore of the bay, these ports are Puerto Ingeniero White<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puertobahiablanca.com/index2_eng.html|title=Puerto de Bahía Blanca -}}</ref> for grains and containers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puertosdeargentina.com.ar/Atlantico/bblanca.htm |title=Bahía Blanca |access-date=19 August 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519074841/http://www.puertosdeargentina.com.ar/Atlantico/bblanca.htm |archive-date=19 May 2006 }}</ref> and [[Puerto Galván]], a smaller one specialising in sunflower and [[soy]] oil, and chemicals such as urea. One of the largest [[urea]] industrial producers in the world, [[Profertil]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.profertil.com.ar|title=Profertil Institucional}}</ref> is located there. Between these two main ports, several industrial and chemical plants operate their piers. The [[petrochemical]] pole of the region made the port a very convenient one.

There are several local societies representing economic activities taking place in the region such as Sociedad Rural, Corporación del Comercio y de la Industria, and Sociedad Industrial, all of whom organize conferences and exhibits linked to the branch of trade, commerce, or industry their associates carry out. Some of the exhibits are quite traditional and have taken place for many years, such as "Exposición Nacional de Ganadería e Industria de la Sociedad Rural de Bahía Blanca", mainly grouping those devoted to cattle husbandry and sheep breeding, which up to 2006 account for 122 annual displays<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanuevaprovincia.com.ar/06/09/23/69n032.sht|title=La Nueva}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> when there is a contest awarding prizes to the best-presented animals.
As far as the retail business goes the biggest presence is the BPM store with over 300 locations in the city and more than 2500 worldwide.

It is located downtown right next to "Teatro Don Bosco", this was key to their success.

==Transportation==
[[File:Bahia Blanca - Terminal de Omnibus 01.jpg|thumb|Bus terminal]]
Bahía Blanca is served by [[Comandante Espora Airport]] (BHI/SAZB). There are two daily short-haul flights from Bahía Blanca (BHI) to the domestic flights airport in Buenos Aires (AEP). The Navy also operates a weekly flight to and from Buenos Aires, for service people who commute between the two cities. The local airport's runways belong to the Navy Aviation (BACE, standing for Base Aeronaval Comandante Espora). There is a civilian terminal supported by the city council apart from the military one. The civilian terminal is undergoing an important renovation.

The bus terminal of the city, recently remodeled and redesigned, services the whole country. The bus transportation system has a wider range of short, medium and long-distance connections and destinations offering many overnight trips from Bahía Blanca to [[Buenos Aires]], to hundreds of cities and towns throughout the country and also to neighbouring countries such as [[Uruguay]].

A network of motorways merge in the city linking it to the region and the rest of the country. In recent years, different administrations have tried to create and improve an outer ring road by which traffic is facilitated avoiding unnecessary congestion allowing lorries or trucks, as well as automobiles, to directly enter and exit the port area. Vehicles passing by can also avoid entering the city via this ring road. There are also projects to improve the road link between the city and the airport. Multiple local bus lines form the city transportation system. The main route, [[Ruta Nacional 3]], is divided there into 3 North, leading to [[Olavarría]] and [[Buenos Aires]], and 3 South leading to [[Viedma]],  [[Trelew]], [[Comodoro Rivadavia]], [[Río Gallegos]], [[Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego|Río Grande]] and [[Ushuaia]]. Other routes include National Route 35, leading to [[Santa Rosa, La Pampa|Santa Rosa]] and [[Río Cuarto, Córdoba|Río Cuarto]], National Route 33, leading to [[Trenque Lauquen]] and [[Rosario]], and National Route [[National Route 22 (Argentina)|22]], which leads to [[Neuquén Province]].

Bahía Blanca has a total of three [[railway station]]s, with no passenger services as of January 2024. The last active station was [[Bahía Blanca Sud railway station|Bahía Blanca Sud]], originally built by British [[Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway|BA Great Southern]] company and opened in 1884, and terminus of [[General Roca Railway]] covering the {{convert|680|km|mi|abbr=on}} distance between [[Constitución railway station|Constitución]] and Bahía Blanca. Services to Bahía Blanca were interrupted by state-owned [[Operadora Ferroviaria Sociedad del Estado|Trenes Argentinos]] in October 2022 after a derailment in Olavarría.<ref name=lanueva>[https://www.lanueva.com/nota/2023-11-27-5-0-45-el-tren-que-no-llega-bahia-sigue-sin-el-servicio El tren que no llega: Bahía sigue sin el servicio] by Pablo Álvarez on ''La Nueva'', 27 November 2023</ref>

The other two stations of the city were built and originally operated by British [[Bahía Blanca and North Western Railway]] (opened in 1891) and French [[Rosario and Puerto Belgrano Railway]] (opened in 1912) respectively. After its closure in 1962, the FCRPB station then served as the municipal library until it was destroyed by fire in 2022.<ref name=oyp>[https://www.oyp.com.ar/nueva/revistas/294/1.php Estación Bahía Blanca al Noroeste, la pérdida de la estación más popular] by Mario Minervino on Obras y Protagonistas</ref>

==Architecture==
{{tone|section|date=April 2020}}
The city has the common features of those founded by the Spanish and their descendants: a main square at the centre surrounded by relevant buildings the likes of The City Hall and the Church (located on opposite although facing sides of the main square). Buildings of administrative importance also surround the main square or are located nearby. The planning which took place before its foundation and during its early development conceived streets parallel to the sides of the main square.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Almost all the blocks are then rectangular in shape. As the city developed the streets were extended and more rectangular blocks were added at the edges. The Administration of the City decided then to observe a plan of development probably about 1960, when it might have been ruled that further developments would follow established criteria according to their purpose: permanent dwellers, public places, industries.
Most of the city has terraced houses although detached houses surrounded by extensive gardens are well developed in some areas such as ''barrio Palihue'', with an adjacent golf course at Club de Golf Palihue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawebdegolf.com/campos/campo.php?pais=Argentina&codp=111&nomp=Buenos_Aires&idcampo=1176|title=La Web de Golf: CLUB DE GOLF PALIHUE (Argentina)|author=Rafael S疣chez S疇z : La Web de Golf|access-date=19 August 2006|archive-date=3 November 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061103063214/http://www.lawebdegolf.com/campos/campo.php?pais=Argentina&codp=111&nomp=Buenos_Aires&idcampo=1176|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Barrio Patagonia'' and country clubs for permanent and also for week-end dwellers were designed and developed at the outskirts of the city.
[[File:Bahia Blanca- club argentino.jpg|thumb|left|Club Argentino]]

The architecture of Bahía Blanca is notable as well. Public buildings such as the seat of the [[Banco de la Nación Argentina|Banco de la Nación]],  [[Bolsa de Comercio de Bahía Blanca]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bolsacombblanca.com.ar|title=Inicio}}</ref> ([[Chamber of Commerce]], the [[stock exchange]]), the main Post Office, the former building of the local newspaper ''La Nueva Provincia'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanuevaprovincia.com.ar|title=La Nueva|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820080939/http://www.lanuevaprovincia.com.ar/|archive-date=20 August 2006}}</ref> the City Hall, the Rectorate and academic departments of Universidad del Sur, its 'Casa de la Cultura', Teatro Municipal (Opera House of the city), Biblioteca Rivadavia<ref name="ABR.org.ar">{{cite web|url=http://www.abr.org.ar/ |title=Asociación Bernardino Rivadavia |access-date=19 August 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823202441/http://www.abr.org.ar/ |archive-date=23 August 2006 }}</ref> and Club Argentino, amongst others, are well-considered pieces of architecture, most of them extremely well preserved. Some of them are of French neoclassical influence (''L'École des Beaux Arts'', Paris).

[[File:Callee.JPG|thumb|right|Suburban Bahía Blanca]]
There are excellent monuments and pieces of sculpture scattered all along the city: in the streets, main buildings and green spaces such as Caronti's bust, facing the City Hall, the Memorial to [[Bernardino Rivadavia]], at the centre of the main square, Fuente de los Ingleses and Memorial of the Israeli community, in the same square. The statue of [[José de San Martín]], in Parque de Mayo, the sculpture group of [[Lola Mora]] in the fountain at the front of Universidad del Sur, the memorial to [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], the statue of [[Isabel I of Castile]] in front of the bus station, donated by the Government of Spain (no such pieces are donated to non capital cities as it has been this case, enhancing the importance of the local Spanish descendants), the pieces which decorate the frontispieces of Banco de la Nación, Edificio Banco Provincia, to the side of the City Hall, [[Saint George]] and the Dragon of the former electrical power plant of [[Ingeniero White]] in the Port, the ones of the former building of [[La Nueva Provincia]] and those of the cathedral are unique, as well as the modern art ones which form the group of Paseo de las Esculturas, indeed remarkable. Although not a sculpture, the mural mosaic of Colegio Don Bosco, on the corner of Vieytes and Moreno streets, by Aurelio Friedrich -a local plastic artist- is to be mentioned. All of them do enrich the architectural, artistic and cultural patrimony and heritage of the city.
Multiple green spaces have been created in the city: Plaza Rivadavia (its main square), Parque de Mayo, Paseo de las Esculturas, Parque Independencia, Plaza 9 de Julio, and Plaza Villa Mitre, are the most familiar ones.

Besides the usual areas included when the city is to be shown to somebody who is unfamiliar with it, other areas of interest include the ''Barrio Inglés'' ('English Quarter') where the British foremen and technicians who built the railways and ports lived, and [[Villa Harding Green]], a suburb where the railway and port managers dwelled.

==Culture and education==
The city is a developed one including cultural and educational aspects. It has a permanent Symphony [[Orchestra]] and a Company of Classical [[Ballet]] (''Ballet del Sur'') with an associate School of Classic Dances.
For further education there are two tertiary institutes and two national universities. The first ones are Instituto Superior Juan XXIII,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juan23.edu.ar|title=Instituto Superior Juan XXIII}}</ref> (probably linked to the future [[UNISAL]] (standing for Universidad Salesiana) of the [[Salesians]]) and [[Instituto Avanza]] (tertiary institute of humanities). National Universities are Facultad Regional Bahía Blanca Universidad Tecnológica Nacional,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frbb.utn.edu.ar/frbb/index.php|title=Universidad Tecnológica Nacional - Facultad Bahía Blanca - Inicio|website=www.frbb.utn.edu.ar}}</ref> devoted mainly to exact sciences and intended for students who do have a job for making a living, with formal activities in the evening; and the [[Universidad Nacional del Sur]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uns.edu.ar|title=Universidad Nacional del Sur - Sitio oficial}}</ref> (''National University of the South''), founded in January 1956. This last one has associated internationally known institutes of research in biological, biochemical and technological sciences such as INIBIB and Instituto de Oceanografia, among others. Both national universities are free of tuition fees for all students. [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureate [[César Milstein]] was born and raised in Bahía Blanca.
[[File:Universidad Nacional del Sur.jpg|left|thumb|[[Universidad Nacional del Sur]]]]

Initial and basic education depend on the Province of Buenos Aires although there is a locally elected Municipal Educational Counselor holding some degree of influence and supervision on both. The system was transformed about ten years ago through the Secretary of Education. What used to be a system with primary (mandatory) and secondary (non-mandatory) education before continuing university studies (the 'French model') became Basic General Education (mandatory) and Polimodal Education (the 'Spanish-Catalan model') although nowadays it is being reviewed and likely to be modified again. Free education is granted by the state although there are semi-private and private schools.

There are reputed provincial Schools of Plastic Arts and Music, free of tuition fees. Foreign languages are taught at public schools at a rather basic level. However, there are local foreign language schools such as the ''Asociación Bahiense de Cultura Inglesa'' (English, also taught by many other institutions), the [[Alliance Française]] (French), the [[Dante Alighieri Society]] (Italian) and [[Goethe-Institut]] (German), all of them private although with a good number of students. Portuguese is also taught. There used to be a school of [[Basque language]] at "Unión Vasca" also named "[[Euzkadi]]" with a much smaller group of students.

===Libraries===
The main public library, Biblioteca Bernardino Rivadavia,<ref name="ABR.org.ar"/> is one of the oldest in the area, possessing a curated collection of around 160,000 books, newspapers, and magazines. In addition, the library of Universidad Nacional del Sur<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bc.uns.edu.ar/|title=Biblioteca Central de la Universidad Nacional del Sur}}</ref> and several smaller council-supported libraries are open to the public.

===Museums===
[[File:Museo Taller Ferrowhite 04.jpg|thumb|Ferrowhite Museum]]
There are several museums in the city which include the Port Museum, the History Museum, the Fine Arts Museum and the Contemporary Arts Museum, these last two ones headed by Betiana Gerardi, where permanent and temporary exhibits take place. Pieces of art from reputed local and Argentine artists belonging to the City patrimony are shown. There are at least two known large oils on canvas by [[Benito Quinquela Martín]], one there—at the Museum—and the other in the mayor's office. Other exhibits do regularly take place at Biblioteca Rivadavia, Chamber of Commerce, Casa de la Cultura and Alliance Française, where frequent ''vernissages'' are organized on the responsibility of different curators. There are at least two associations of local and regional plastic artists, Asociación de Bahiense de Artistas Plásticos and Asociacion de Artistas del Sur, both of them actively promoting workshops and exhibits throughout the year, also in charge of the organization of multiple cultural activities.

A military museum organised by the Army at its local "Comando del V Cuerpo de Ejército" (V Army Corps Command)<ref>http://www.vtocuerpo.ejercito.mil.ar {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051223045245/http://www.vtocuerpo.ejercito.mil.ar/ |date=23 December 2005 }}</ref> at which a miniaturized recreation of the original Fortress is on display, made by César Puliafito, as well as a quite interesting collection of ancient maps, documents and pieces alongside one of the most important -and rather unknown- libraries of history in the region: this one and the one of the [[Salesians]], at Inspectoría San Francisco Javier (Head of the [[Salesians of Don Bosco]] for the whole [[Patagonia]]) have fantastic collections with many priceless documents related to the conquest and "civilization" of Patagonia, almost completely carried out by the Army and the Salesians. The Army Museum of History of Bahía Blanca is open to the public with guided tours being available on appointment. All museums in the city have free admission.

===Publications===
There is one local and regional newspaper, ''[[La Nueva Provincia]]'', as well as regularly published [[Bibliographic index|index]]ed [[scientific journal]]s such as Revista Científica de la Asociación Médica de Bahía Blanca<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ambb.com.ar/index.php?SESID=9d59c83357599920e598fbc9623b602b&mp_id=0&mp_op=2&spN1_id=2&spN1_op=6%7ctitle=AMBB%7c |title=Bienvenidos a la Asociación Médica de Bahía Blanca |publisher=Asociación Médica de Bahía Blanca |access-date=30 May 2016 }}</ref> ''(Bahía Blanca Medical Association Scientific Journal)'' in Spanish with abstracts in both Spanish and English. EDIUNS, the publisher of Universidad Nacional del Sur, produces what Scientists, Professors and Lecturers edit facilitating them all the processes related to publishing including  copyright procedures which is beneficial for both editors and readers. [[CREEBBA]] (the Regional Center for Economic Studies of Bahía Blanca, Argentina) publishes respected, independent reports regarding financial and economical aspects of the city and its area of influence. Written in Spanish, they also comment on national macroeconomic issues.<ref name="Creebba.org.ar"/>

===Shopping===
[[File:Calle Alsina Bahía Blanca.JPG|thumb|right|Alsina Street, now pedestrianized]]
Two shopping centres are located at the outskirts of the city and many shops in the centre itself are quite active and offer a variety of first line goods and products.

The [[illiteracy]] rate of the city, as well as the neonatal and [[infant mortality rate]]s, are amongst the lowest in the country. Besides the national censuses -which take place every ten years-, the Ministry of Economy carries out periodical regional censuses sampling urban areas collecting data on economic and social indexes, such as ''Encuesta Permanente de Hogares'' by [[INDEC]]. There are two principal hospitals in the city: a provincial one, Hospital Dr José Penna,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hospitalpenna.com.ar/|title=Inicio - Hospital Penna|access-date=20 August 2006|archive-date=10 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191110170700/http://www.hospitalpenna.com.ar/|url-status=dead}}</ref> and a municipal one, Hospital Municipal Dr Leónidas Lucero,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hmabb.gov.ar/municipal_historia.htm |title=Hospital Municipal de Agudos &#124; Historia |website=www.hmabb.gov.ar |access-date=13 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030413185546/http://www.hmabb.gov.ar/municipal_historia.htm |archive-date=13 April 2003 |url-status=dead}}</ref> both of them tertiary centres for assistance and referrals throughout the region.

There are also private health care institutions. There is one physician for every 266 inhabitants. Public health is coordinated between the Minister of Health of the [[Buenos Aires Province]], who has a Delegate in Bahía Blanca (Zona Sanitaria I), and the City Administration under the supervision of the local Secretary of Health appointed directly by the city mayor.
