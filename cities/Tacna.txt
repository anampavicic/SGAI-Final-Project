A very commercially active city, it is located only {{Convert|35|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north of the border with [[Arica y Parinacota Region]] from [[Chile]], inland from the [[Pacific Ocean]] and in the valley of the [[Caplina River]]. It is Peru's tenth most populous city.

The city has gained a reputation for its patriotism, with many monuments and streets named after heroes of Peru's struggle for independence (1821–1824) and the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–1883). Residents of Tacna are known in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as ''{{lang|es|tacneños}}''.

[[Francisco Antonio de Zela]], a royal accountant (similar in function to a modern-day income tax auditor), [[1811 Tacna rebellion|initiated the push]] for Peruvian Independence from [[Spain]] in 1811 in Tacna, leading to a series of commemorative actions for the city, culminating in the 1828 declaration of Tacna as the "Heroic City" (''{{lang|la|La Heroica Ciudad de San Pedro de Tacna}}'') by President [[José de La Mar]].

It was the capital of the short-lived [[Peru–Bolivian Confederation]] (1836–1839).

Tacna was known for its mining industry; it had significant deposits of [[sodium nitrate]] and other resources.<ref name="EB1911">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Tacna|volume=26|page=347}}</ref> Its economic prosperity attracted a wave of immigrants from [[Italy]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Today, their [[Italian Peruvian]] descendants live in the city and many of them still have Italian surnames. This era of successful commerce and agriculture ended drastically with the start of the [[War of the Pacific]]. Hosting a large Peru-Bolivian army under poor sanitary conditions the city lost a substantial part of its population to [[infectious disease]]s before its capture by Chile in May 1880 following a [[Battle of Tacna|defeat of the allied army]] in the outskirts of the city by a Chilean force under General [[Manuel Baquedano]].<ref name=Casanovaetal2017>{{Cite journal|title=Tras los pasos de la muerte.

===Chilean administration===
During the war, the Tacna—as well as neighbouring [[Arica, Chile|Arica]]—was administered by the [[Chilean Army]] and incorporated as a [[Communes of Chile|commune]] that served as the [[Capital city|seat]] of the eponymous [[Tacna Department (Chile)|department]] and [[Tacna Province (Chile)|province]]. In modern Peruvian historiography, this period is known as the {{lang|es|cautiverio}}.<ref name=Municipalidad/> The [[Treaty of Ancón]] was signed in 1883 between Peru and Chile, ending the war. Under the terms of the treaty, Chile was to administer the provinces of Tacna and Arica for ten years, taking control of valuable [[mineral deposit]]s, after which a [[plebiscite]] was to be held to determine the region's sovereignty. But when the ten years had elapsed, the two sides could not agree whether to include a large number of imported Chilean laborers in the vote.<ref name="EB1911"/> Throughout the administration, Chilean groups and authorities led a [[Chilenization of Tacna, Arica and Tarapacá|campaign of Chilenization]] in an attempt to persuade the local population to abandon their Peruvian past and accept Chilean nationality. However, Peruvian [[nationalists]] ensured that the Chilean propaganda failed and the planned plebiscite was never held.

The commune was formally created through a decree on 22 December  1891,<ref>{{Cite book |title=Comentarios y concordancias de la Ley de Organización y Atribuciones de las Municipalidades de 22 de diciembre de 1891 |last=Correa Bravo |first=Agustín |publisher=Imprenta Cervantes |year=1903 |location=Santiago, Chile |language=es}}</ref> taking into account the limits assigned by the decrees of 9 November 1885 and 10 May 1886,<ref>{{Cite book |title=Chile. Historia de la división político-administrativa 1810-2000 |last=Zamudio |first=Orlando |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas |year=2001 |location=Santiago, Chile |language=es}}</ref> and was composed of four subdelegations: ''El Callao'', ''San Ramón'', ''El Mercado'' and ''El Alto de Lima''.

According to the 1907 census, the population that year was numbered at 10,593 people.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Censo de la República de Chile levantado el 28 de noviembre de 1907 |publisher=Oficina Nacional de Estadísticas; Sociedad Imp. y Litogr.

Starting in 1 February 1928, by virtue of Decree with Force of Law No. 8,583 published that 28 January under the government of [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]], the commune of Tacna was composed of three subdelegations: ''Intendencia'', ''Comercio'' and ''Pocollay''. This decree also ordered the creation of the communes of [[Palca, Chile|Palca]] and [[Sama, Chile|Sama]], which together with Tacna formed a single municipal group; That is, neither Palca and Sama had their own communal government as in most communes in Chile.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.leychile.cl/Consulta/m/norma_plana?org=&idNorma=19463 |title=DTO 8583 28-ENE-1928 |date=1928-01-28 |website=[[Library of the National Congress of Chile|Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional de Chile / BCN]] |publisher=[[Ministry of the Interior (Chile)|Ministerio del Interior]]}}</ref>

In 1929, the [[Treaty of Lima (1929)|Treaty of Lima]] was signed in which Chile kept Arica, whilst Peru [[Handover of Tacna|reacquired]] Tacna and received a $6 million indemnity and other concessions. The commune ceased to exist when the treaty became effective on 28 August,<ref>{{Cite news |title=A 80 años de la restitución de Tacna |url=http://www.estrellaiquique.cl/prontus4_nots/site/artic/20090828/pags/20090828001002.html |date=2009-08-28 |work=La Estrella de Iquique}}</ref> in a ceremony held at the home of the prefect Federico Fernandini, in which an agreement was signed between the interim mayor of the Chilean province of Tacna, Gonzalo Robles, and a delegation of Peru headed by Foreign Minister [[Pedro José Rada y Gamio]]. At 4 p.m. that day, the Peruvian municipality of Tacna began its functions.<ref>''[[La Nación (Chile)|La Nación]]'', 29 August 1929, p. 15</ref>

===History after 1929===
Today, Tacna is a mostly commercial city with many migrants from the [[Puno Region]] living there. Its economy is based on mercantile activities with the north of Chile (Arica and [[Iquique]]). Since it is part of a [[duty-free]] zone, Tacna has come to rival [[Arequipa]] as southern Peru's main business area. The city has one of the largest artifact markets in the world with imports from [[Japan]] and [[China]], and traditional Peruvian handicrafts.

==Geography==
The area is generally desert, with a few fertile spots near the mountains. Except for [[Caplina River|Caplina]], no rivers cross the entire province.<ref name="EB1911"/>

===Climate===
Tacna has a [[desert climate]] (''BWk/BWh'', according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]).

==Tourist attractions==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2023}}
Many monuments are located in this city, including the arch of the [[Alto de la Alianza]] and the [[Tacna Parabolic Arch]].

Other monuments include a neo-[[renaissance]] [[Tacna Cathedral|Cathedral]], [[Courthouse, Tacna|the Courthouse]], the [[Alameda Bolognesi]] and the [[Toquepala Caves|caves of Toquepala]], where [[archaeology|archaeologists]] have found some of the oldest human remains in Peru.

==Festivities==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2023}}
The most important festivity in the city is the ''Semana de Tacna'' ("Tacna Week"), which runs from August 25–30.

On 28 August, a large [[Flag of Peru|Peruvian flag]] is shown throughout the city during the ''{{lang|es|Paseo de la Bandera}}'', which celebrates the anniversary of the reincorporation of Tacna into Peruvian sovereignty and is one of the most important patriotic demonstrations in the whole country. This tradition started in 1901, during the Chilean administration of Tacna, by a group of ''tacneños'' who defied the prohibition of showing Peruvian flags imposed by the Chilean authorities.

There is an agrarian and industrial fair as part of these celebrations.

In September, the festival of the [[Señor de Locumba]] is celebrated, which draws thousands of faithful people from all over the world.
