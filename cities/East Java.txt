It has a land border only with the province of [[Central Java]] to the west; the [[Java Sea]] and the [[Indian Ocean]] border its northern and southern coasts, respectively, while the narrow [[Bali Strait]] to the east separates Java from [[Bali]] by around {{convert|2.29|km|mi}}. Located in eastern [[Java (island)|Java]], the province also includes the island of [[Madura Island|Madura]] (which is connected to Java by the longest bridge in Indonesia, the [[Suramadu Bridge]]), as well as the [[Kangean Islands|Kangean islands]] and other smaller island groups located further east (in the northern [[Bali Sea]]) and the [[Masalembu Islands|Masalembu]] archipelago to the north. Its capital is [[Surabaya]], the [[Largest cities in Indonesia|second largest city in Indonesia]], a major industrial center and also a major business center. [[Banyuwangi]] is the largest regency in East Java and the largest on the island of Java.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://jatim.bps.go.id/dynamictable/2017/08/28/46/luas-wilayah-menurut-kabupaten-kota-di-provinsi-jawa-timur-2016.html |title=BPS Provinsi Jawa Timur |website=jatim.bps.go.id |language=en |access-date=2018-09-18 |archive-date=9 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220409021013/https://jatim.bps.go.id/dynamictable/2017/08/28/46/luas-wilayah-menurut-kabupaten-kota-di-provinsi-jawa-timur-2016.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Most of the people in East Java adheres to [[Islam]], forming around 94% of the total population. Other religions are also practiced, such as [[Christianity]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Confucianism]] which are mostly practised by [[Chinese Indonesians|Tionghoa]] people and immigrants from [[Eastern Indonesia]] and [[North Sumatra]], and also [[Hinduism]] which are practised by the [[Tenggerese people]] in the [[Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park]] and the [[Balinese people]] inhabiting the easternmost part of the province bordering [[Bali]] as well as the dominant minority [[Indian Indonesians]] in [[Surabaya]] city.

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===
East Java has been inhabited by humans since prehistoric times. This was proven by the discovery of fossils remains of the ''[[Mojokerto child|Pithecanthropus mojokertensis]]'' in Kepuhlagen, [[Mojokerto Regency|Mojokerto]];<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YvPLCgAAQBAJ&q=The+Palaeolithic+Settlement+of+Asia |title=The Palaeolithic Settlement of Asia |last=Dennell |first=Robin |author-link=Robin Dennell |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-521-84866-4 |location=[[Cambridge]] |pages=155 |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511818882 |access-date=25 October 2020 |archive-date=1 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230501012152/https://books.google.com/books?id=YvPLCgAAQBAJ&q=The+Palaeolithic+Settlement+of+Asia |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Java Man|Pithecanthropus erectus]]'' on [[Trinil]], [[Ngawi Regency|Ngawi]];<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/J/bo3613841.html |title=Java Man: How Two Geologists Changed Our Understanding of Human Evolution |last1=Curtis |first1=Garniss |author-link=Garniss Curtis |last2=Lewin |first2=Roger |author-link2=Roger Lewin |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-226-78734-3 |location=[[Chicago]] |pages=70 |access-date=15 March 2019 |archive-date=29 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229232537/http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/J/bo3613841.html |url-status=live }}</ref> and ''[[Wajak crania|Homo wajakensis]]'' in Wajak, [[Tulungagung Regency|Tulungagung]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The evolutionary significance of the Wadjak skulls |last=Storm |first=Paul |publisher=[[Naturalis Biodiversity Center|Nationaal Natuurhistorisch Museum]] |year=1995 |location=[[Leiden]]}}</ref>

The [[Dinoyo inscription]]s found near the city of [[Malang]] are the oldest written sources in East Java, dating from 760 CE. It tells of many political and cultural events in the Kingdom of Kanjuruhan. The name Malang is thought to come from the name of a sacred building called Malangkuseswara. This name is contained in the [[Mantyasih]] inscription written in 907 CE.

In 1222, [[Ken Arok]] founded the [[Singhasari|Kingdom of Singhasari]], which he ruled until 1292. Before coming to power, Ken Arok seized power in Tumapel ([[Kediri (city)|Kediri]]) from Tungul Ametung. Ken Arok's descendants became kings of [[Singhasari]] and [[Majapahit]] from the 13th until the 15th century.

In 1227, [[Anusapati]] killed Ken Arok, and later became king of Singhasari. Anusapati's power only lasted 20 years, before he was killed by Tohjaya. Three years later, Tohjaya was killed in an uprising led by Jaya Wisnuwardhana, son of Anusapati. In 1268, Wisnuwardhana died, and he was succeeded by [[Kertanegara of Singhasari|Kertanegara]] (1268–1292). In 1292 Kertanegara was defeated by a rebel named Jayakatwang, ending the Singhasari.

In 1293, [[Kublai Khan]], founder of the [[Yuan dynasty]], sent a large invasion fleet to Java with 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers, beginning the [[Mongol invasion of Java]].<ref>{{citation |last=Weatherford |first=Jack |title=Genghis khan and the making of the modern world |page=239 |year=2004 |location=New York |publisher=Random House |isbn=0-609-80964-4}}</ref> This was a [[punitive expedition]] against King Kertanegara of Singhasari, who had refused to pay tribute to the Yuan and maimed one of its ministers. However, it ended with failure for the [[Mongols]].

In 1294, the [[Majapahit|Kingdom of Majapahit]] was founded by [[Raden Wijaya]]. The Majapahit reached its peak during the reign of [[Hayam Wuruk]]. He was accompanied by the ''Mahapatih'' [[Gajah Mada]]. Together they managed to unite the archipelago under the name Dwipantara. Majapahit developed to become one of the strongest empires in Southeast Asia.

In 1357, the [[Battle of Bubat]] occurred, starting a war between the [[Sunda Kingdom]] and the Majapahit. The event stemei from the desire of king Hayam Wuruk to take a [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] princess. Dyah Pitaloka as queen. However, because of a misunderstanding about the procedure of marriage, leading to a battle in Bubat. Majapahit troops, under the command of Gajah Mada capturud [[Pajajaran]]. In 1389, Hayam Wuruk died, and was succeeded by [[Wikramawardhana]]. This resulted in the beginning of the decline of the Majapahit Empire. As the Majapahit Empire went into decline in the late 1300s, Islam moved to fill the vacuum.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/East-Java|title=East Java {{!}} province, Indonesia|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-03-01|archive-date=26 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200426212614/https://www.britannica.com/place/East-Java|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Islamic era ===
{{Main|Spread of Islam in Indonesia}}

[[File:Ampel Mosque in 2008.jpg|thumb|The [[Ampel Mosque]] in [[Surabaya]], the [[List of the oldest mosques|oldest surviving mosque]] in [[Java]] and second oldest in [[Indonesia]], was built in 1421.]]

The precise date when Islam entered Java remains unclear. This is due to the absence of a definite source regarding the arrival of Islam in Java. However, according to some experts{{Like whom?|{{subst:August 2020}}|date=August 2020}}, it is estimated that Islam entered Java around the 11th century, with the tomb of Fatimah Binti Maimun in the village of Leran in [[Gresik Regency]] which dates from 475 AH (1085 AD). The tomb also shows that by the 11th century, the North coast of Java had been frequented by [[Arabs|Arab]] traders from the Middle East. In addition, several Islamic tombs were discovered in [[Trowulan]], located in what is now part of the [[Mojokerto Regency]], near the site of the former Majapahit palace.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/indonesia/indonesia-40319665 |title=Arkeolog dan ahli naskah tanggapi klaim Majapahit sebagai kerajaan Islam |last=Affan |first=Heyder |date=2017-06-19 |access-date=2019-03-01 |language=en-GB |archive-date=2 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190302033140/https://www.bbc.com/indonesia/indonesia-40319665 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the 15th century, a Chinese [[Hui people|Hui]] voyager named [[Ma Huan]] visited East Java. He then wrote the book ''[[Yingya Shenglan]]'', which tells the story of the countries he visited over the course of the [[Ming treasure voyages]]. He mentioned that at that time, there were three different peoples inhabiting Eastern Java: Arabs from the Middle East, the ancestor of the modern [[Arab Indonesians]]; Chinese Muslims originating from modern-day [[Guangdong]] province, and the native [[Javanese people]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Ying-Yai Sheng-Lan |publisher=Ma Huan, Translated from the Chinese text edited by Feng Ch’eng-Chün with introduction, notes and appendices by J. V. G. Mills |year=1433 |pages=138}}</ref>

By the 16th century, the Majapahit Empire was defeated by Islamic kingdoms in Java, resulting in the exile of many Majapahit aristocrats to the neighbouring island of [[Bali]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P3btDAAAQBAJ&q=majapahit+kabur+ke+bali&pg=PA57 |title=Muslim Bali: Mencari Kembali Harmoni yang Hilang |last=Mashad |first=Dhurorudin |date=2014-01-01 |publisher=Pustaka Al Kautsar |isbn=9789795926665 |language=id |access-date=25 October 2020 |archive-date=1 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230501012210/https://books.google.com/books?id=P3btDAAAQBAJ&q=majapahit+kabur+ke+bali&pg=PA57 |url-status=live }}</ref> Those who remained in Java were forced to convert to Islam, while a small pocket of isolated people living in the [[Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park]] spread around [[Pasuruan Regency|Pasuruan]], [[Probolinggo Regency|Probolinggo]], [[Malang Regency|Malang]], and [[Lumajang Regency|Lumajang]] [[Regencies of Indonesia|Regencies]] remains adhered to [[Hinduism]] to this day. They are known as the [[Tenggerese people]]. Their population of roughly 100,000 is centered in 30 villages in the isolated Tengger mountains.<ref>{{cite book |author=James Minahan |title=Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific: An Encyclopedia |year=2012 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-59884-660-7}}</ref>

When Islamic sultanates started ruling Java, cities in the northern coast started developing, becoming thriving ports. One of them was the town of [[Tuban]], which was a wealthy and important port with many Chinese settlers. Being a port of the Majapahit and the point of departure for the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccas]], it exported an abundant supply of foodstuffs and imported a rich variety of products from the Moluccas.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Yingya Shenglan |publisher=Ma Huan, Translated from the Chinese text edited by Feng Ch’eng-Chün with introduction, notes and appendices by J. V. G. Mills |year=1970 |pages=89}}</ref> At the end of the 16th century, Islam had surpassed Hinduism and Buddhism as the dominant religion in Java. At first, the spread of Islam was very rapid and was accepted by ordinary people, until the [[da'wah]] entered and it was carried out by the rulers of the island.

=== European colonization ===
The relationship between the Javanese and European colonial powers began in 1522, with the signing of a treaty between the Sunda Kingdom and the [[Portuguese Empire]] in [[Malacca]]. After the failure of the treaty, the Portuguese presence was then limited to Malacca in the [[Malay Peninsula]] and the [[Maluku Islands]]. An expedition under the leadership of the Dutch explorer [[Cornelis de Houtman]] consisting of four ships in 1596 became the beginning of Dutch presence in the island.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Globe Encompassed: The Age of European Discovery, 1500–1700 |author=Ames, Glenn J. |year=2008 |page=99}}</ref> At the end of the 18th century, the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] had succeeded in expanding their influence on the Islamic sultanates in the interior of the island of Java.

At the onset of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Invasion of Java (1811)|British conquered Java]] in 1811. Java briefly became part of the [[British Empire]], with Sir [[Stamford Raffles]] as its Governor-General. In 1814, Britain returned Java to the Netherlands as stipulated in the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Coins And Tokens Of The Possessions And Colonies Of The British Empire |last=Atkins |first=James |publisher=Quaritch, Bernard |year=1889 |location=London |pages=213}}</ref>

=== Japanese occupation and revolution ===
[[File:Surabaya, Netherlands East Indies, under attack, 17 May 1944 (NNAM.1996.488.024.025).jpg|thumb|[[Operation Transom]], destroyed [[Port of Tanjung Perak|Tanjung Perak]] in 1944.]]
During the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies]], there was persistent resistance against the Japanese rule. In [[Blitar]], an uprising by ''[[Defenders of the Homeland|Pembela Tanah Air]]'' (PETA) led by [[Supriyadi]], Moeradi, Halir Mangkudijoyo, and Soemarto occurred in early 1945, but it was crushed by the Japanese.

Two weeks after the [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclamation of independence]], [[Surabaya]] established its own government under, [[Sudirman|Raden Sudirman]]. The formation of government in Surabaya caused disputes between the republican forces and Japanese troops, resulting in various skirmishes across the city. This was because when the Japanese surrendered, they were obliged to remain in power until the allied forces arrived. The arrival of allied forces in Surabaya created tensions with the newly established government of Indonesia, reaching peak on 10 November 1945 where a major [[Battle of Surabaya|battle]] between the Surabayan residents led by [[Sutomo]] and allied forces.

The battle forced the governor, Suryo, on the advice of People's Security Army (TKR), to move the seat of the government to [[Mojokerto]]. A week later, the government retreated again to a more secure location in Kediri. However, security situation Kediri worsen until finally, in February 1947, the East Java provincial government fled to Malang. While the administration was based in Malang, Governor [[Ario Soerjo|Soerjo]] was replaced by R.P. Suroso, who was in turn replaced again by Dr. Moerdjani. On 21 July 1947, although still bound by the [[Linggadjati Agreement]], a ceasefire agreement in effect since 14 October 1946, the Dutch commenced a military action, [[Operation Product]], which led to deteriorating security conditions in Malang. The East Java provincial government moved again to Blitar.

This military action ended after the [[Renville Agreement]]. However, this agreement reduced the territory controlled by the East Java provincial government. The Netherlands then turned the areas under its control into new federal states, the [[State of Madura]] and the [[State of East Java]]. Amid the difficulties faced by the government of Indonesia, a left-wing opposition group, ''Front Demokrasi Rakyat'' (FDR, People's Democratic Front) launched [[Madiun Affair|rebellion in Madiun]] on 18 September 1948. However, eventually this revolt was defeated by the [[Indonesian Army]]. On 19 December 1948, the Dutch launched [[Operation Kraai]]. Blitar, the seat of the East Java provincial government was attacked by the Dutch. Governor Moerdjani and his staff were forced to flee and joined the guerrillas on the slopes of [[Mount Wilis]]. Operation Kraai ended after the [[Roem–Van Roijen Agreement]] on 7 May 1949.

Following the [[Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference]], at which the Netherlands agreed to transfer sovereignty to the [[United States of Indonesia]], the Dutch withdrew its troops from East Java. East Java changed its status from a province into a state. However, on 25 February 1950, this was dissolved and became part of the territory of the [[Republic of Indonesia (1949–50)|Republic of Indonesia]]. The [[State of Madura]] also decided to join Indonesia.

=== Contemporary era ===
Along with rapid growth of urbanization in East Java, the governments could not satisfy the population's needs for affordable housing, which led to the building of [[shanty towns]] along the rivers and rail tracks. Today, the shanty towns still exist; although some have been transformed into "better" housing.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://republika.co.id/berita/nasional/daerah/17/02/10/ol4fs9284-kota-malang-masih-hadapi-permukiman-kumuh |title=Kota Malang Masih Hadapi Permukiman Kumuh |date=2017-02-10 |website=Republika Online |language=id|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316175230/https://republika.co.id/berita/nasional/daerah/17/02/10/ol4fs9284-kota-malang-masih-hadapi-permukiman-kumuh|archive-date=2018-03-16|access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref>

The length of the east–west stretch of about 400&nbsp;km. The width of the stretch of the north–south in the west about 200&nbsp;km, but in the eastern part of narrower by about 60&nbsp;km. [[Madura]] is the largest island in East Java, separated from the mainland Java by the [[Strait of Madura]]. [[Bawean Island]] is located about 150&nbsp;km north of Java. In the east of Madura there are clusters of islands, the easternmost are the [[Kangean Islands]] and the northernmost are the [[Masalembu Islands]]. Off the south coast of Java there are two small islands namely [[Nusa Barong]] and [[Sempu (island)|Sempu Island]].

=== Geology ===
In physiographic of geology, East Java Province can be grouped into three zones: the southern zone (plato), the middle zone (volcanic), and the northern zone (folds). Lowlands and highlands in the middle (of Ngawi, Blitar, Malang, to Bondowoso) has a fairly fertile soil. In the northern part ( Bojonegoro, Tuban, Gresik, to Madura Island) lies the Kapur Utara mountains and the Kendeng mountains which are relatively barren.

In the middle of the province stretch mountain ranges and volcanoes: On the border with Central Java is [[Mount Lawu]] (3,265 metres). Southeast from Madiun is [[Mount Wilis]] (2,169 metres), and Mount Liman (2,563 metres). In the middle of the corridor lies the Anjasmoro mountains with peaks [[Arjuno-Welirang|Mount Arjuno]] (3,339 metres), Mount Welirang (3,156 metres), Mount Anjasmoro (2,277 metres), Mount Kawi (2,551 metres), and [[Mount Kelud]] (1,731 metres); The mountains are located in most Kediri, Blitar, Malang, Pasuruan, Mojokerto and Jombang. The group has the peak of Mount Bromo Tengger (2,329 metres), and Mount Semeru (3,676 metres). [[Mount Semeru]], which is also called Mahameru is the highest mountain in the island of Java. In the easternmost part if the province, there are two groups of mountains: the Iyang mountains with the peak Mount Argopuro (3,088 metres), the Ijen mountains with the peak [[Mount Raung]] (3344 metres) In the south there is a series of hills, that of the south coast of Pacitan, Trenggalek, Tulungagung, Blitar, Malang. the Kapur Selatan mountains is a continuation of a series of the Sewu mountains in Yogyakarta.

Two of the most important rivers in East Java is the [[Brantas River]] (290&nbsp;kilometres), and the [[Solo River]] (548&nbsp;kilometers). Brantas River has headwaters on the slopes Mount Arjuno near Batu, and flows through most areas in East Java, like Malang, Blitar, Tulungagung, Kediri, Jombang and Mojokerto. In Mojokerto, Brantas River split into two: [[Kali Mas]], and Porong; both empties into the Madura Strait. Solo River has headwaters on the slopes of Mount Lawu which lies on the border of East Java and Central Java, and flows through a portion of the eastern part of Central Java and East Java, which eventually empties in Gresik. Brantas River and Bengawan Solo are managed by Perum Jasa Tirta I. On the slopes of Mount Lawu near the border with Central Java are Sarangan, a natural lake. The main dam in East Java, among others Ir. Sutami and Selorejo Dam, which is used for irrigation, fish farming and tourism.

Akin to [[Central Java]], the region's birth rates are not necessarily any lower than the rest of Java, however due to net population outflows, especially in times of calamity, not limited to volcanic eruptions or droughts, the region has varying rates of population growth that are generally lower than national average. Ethnic [[Javanese people|Javanese]] dominate the Java mainland as well as the total population of the province overall, while ethnic [[Madurese people|Madurese]] inhabit Madura and the Kangean and Masalembu archipelagos, though centuries of migrations have led the Java mainland to have a larger proportion of Madurese people than Madura itself. Minorities include distinct Javanese ethnicities such as the [[Tenggerese people|Tengger]] people in the [[Mount Bromo]] region, and the [[Saminism Movement|Samin]] and the [[Osing people]] in [[Banyuwangi]]. East Java also hosts a significant population of foreign ethnic groups, such as [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]], Indians, and Arabs.

=== Languages ===
Besides the national language ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]), the people of East Java predominantly use the [[Javanese language|Javanese]] in daily life. Javanese as spoken in the western part of East Java (''Kulonan'') is a similar dialect to the one spoken in [[Central Java]], with its hierarchy of high, medium, and low registers. In the eastern part, such as Surabaya, Malang, and others, a more egalitarian version of Javanese is spoken, with less regard of hierarchy and a richer vocabulary for vulgarity. The dialect is notable for its roughness compared to other dialects spoken elsewhere in Java (especially the Mataram dialect spoken around [[Surakarta]] and [[Yogyakarta]], which is renowned for its smoothness) and contributes to the stereotype among Javanese people of East Javanese being "blunt" and "loud".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.hipwee.com/hiburan/serba-serbi-kehidupan-yang-dialami-oleh-arek-arek-jowo-timur/ |title=Serba-Serbi Kehidupan yang Cuma Dialami Oleh Arek-Arek Jowo Timur |last=Karina |first=Ernia |date=2015-09-17 |work=Hipwee |access-date=2018-09-26 |language=id-ID |archive-date=26 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926205725/https://www.hipwee.com/hiburan/serba-serbi-kehidupan-yang-dialami-oleh-arek-arek-jowo-timur/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Variants of Javanese are also used by Osing and Tengger minorities, the former utilizing a [[Balinese language|Balinese]]-influenced Javanese by virtue of its closeness with Bali island, and the latter speaking an archaic form of the language that retains many features now lost in other more-innovative Javanese dialects.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?menu=004&LangID=213 |title=Profile of |last=Project |first=UCLA Language Materials |date=1600-12-31 |language=en|access-date=2018-09-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230065855/http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?menu=004&LangID=213|archive-date=2010-12-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>
Other than Javanese, minority language includes [[Madurese language|Madurese]], spoken by around 4&nbsp;million ethnic Madurese people inhabiting the [[Madura Island]]s; though they live practically next door with the Javanese, the language is actually more closer genetically to Balinese, and [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Madurese-language |title=Madurese language |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=2018-09-26 |language=en |archive-date=26 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926210011/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Madurese-language |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Religion===
{{see|Islam in East Java|Hinduism in Java}}
A long time ago, Hinduism and Buddhism dominated the island until [[Islam]] gradually [[The spread of Islam in Indonesia|supplanted Hinduism in the 14th and 15th century]]. The last nobles and people of the fallen [[Majapahit]] fled to [[Bali]]. Islam spread from northern cities in Java where many [[Muslim]] traders from [[Gujarat]], [[India]] stopped by. The eastern part of East Java, from Surabaya to Pasuruan, and the cities along the coast, and back to Banyuwangi to Jember, are known as the [[Eastern salient of Java|eastern salient]], or "''Kawasan Tapal Kuda''" (the Horseshoe Region).

A remnant of Hindu tradition and syncretic ''[[abangan]]'' exists because of Islamic and Hinduism acculturation in Java.<gallery>
