==History==
The area of Sanda was part of ancient [[Settsu Province]], and has been inhabited since the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period.  The name "Sanda" has been in use since long ago. Records found within a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Maitreya]] statue in the ancient Konshin-ji Temple read: "These areas are decreed as Matsuyama's land, which includes Onden, Hiden and Keiden, which are three rice fields, and the land is thus renamed Sanda." In Japanese, "san" means three and "ta" (pronounced "da" following "n") means rice field. The earliest document on record which refers to Sanda is from 1477.

Sanda Castle was erected during the [[Muromachi period]]. A [[jōkamachi|castle town]] later developed during the [[Azuchi-Momoyama period]], and under the [[Edo Period]] [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. Sanda was the center of the 36,000 ''[[koku]]'' [[Sanda Domain]], ruled through most of its history by the Kuki clan.

Following the [[Meiji restoration]], the town of Sanda was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system.  The town prospered thanks to the completion of a railroad system which connected the town and the surrounding areas. In 1956, the towns of Miwa, Hirono, Ono, and Takahira merged into the town of Sanda. Finally, Sanda annexed Aino, itself a merger of towns Ai and Honjō, in 1957. Sanda was upgraded from a town to a city on July 1, 1958. 

==Government==
Sanda has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 22 members. Sanda  contributes two members to the Hyōgo Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is within Hyōgo 5th districts of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].
