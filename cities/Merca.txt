'''Merca''' ({{langx|so|Marka}}, {{langx|ar|ماركا}})  is the capital city of the [[Lower Shebelle]] province of [[Somalia]], a historic port city in the region. It is located approximately {{convert|109|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the southwest of the nation's capital [[Mogadishu]]. Merca is the traditional home territory of the Bimal  clan and was the center of the [[Bimal revolt]].<ref name=":0">http://www.landinfo.no/asset/2736/1/2736_1.pdf Marka is the traditional home territory of the Midgan clan of Madhiban (Lewis 2008, p. 5).</ref>

==History==
===Antiquity===
The city of [[Essina]] is believed to have been the predecessor state of Merca. It used to be an ancient [[Proto-Somali]] [[Marketplace|emporium]] city-state.<ref>Ptolemy's Topography of Eastern Equatorial Africa, by Henry Schlichter Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society and Monthly Record of Geography © 1891 - p. 443</ref> It is mentioned in the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'', a Greek travel document dating from the first century AD, as one of a series of commercial ports on the Somali littoral.{{sfn|Jama|1962|p=19}} According to the ''Periplus'', maritime trade already connected peoples in the Merca area with other communities along the Somali Sea coast.{{sfn|Huntingford|1980|p=94}}

===Medieval Period===

[[File:Merca_minaret_moonrise.jpg|left|thumb|200x200px|[[Minaret]] and moonrise in Merca]]
According to the 12th-century author [[Muhammad al-Idrisi|Al-Idrisi]] the [[Hawiye]] occupied the coastal areas between [[Ras Hafun]] and Merca, as well as the lower basin of the lower [[Shebelle River|Shabelle]] river. Al-Idrisi's mention of the [[Hawiye]] is the first documentary reference to a specific Somali group in the Horn. Later Arab writers also make references to the [[Hawiye]] clan in connection with both Merca and the lower Shabelle valley. [[Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi|Ibn Sa'id]] (1214–74), for instance, considered Merca to be the capital of the Hawiye, who lived in fifty villages on the bank of a river which he called ''the Nile of Mogadishu'', a clear reference to the Shabelle river. [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], another thirteen-century Arab geographer also mentions Merca, which he says belonged to the ''Black Berbers'' considered ancestors of modern [[Somalis]].<ref name= "Cambridge 137">{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge history of Africa: Fage, J.

During the Middle Ages, the area was one of several prominent administrative centers of the [[Ajuran Sultanate]]. The polity formed one of the largest kingdoms in the  [[Horn of Africa|Horn]] region. Various [[pillar tomb]]s exist in the region, which local tradition holds were built in the 15th century when the Sultanate's [[Somali aristocratic and court titles|naa'ibs]] governed the district.<ref name="Michigan">{{cite book|title=Northeast African Studies|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8QAOAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA115%7C|year=1989|publisher=African Studies Center, Michigan State University|page= 115}}</ref> According to [[Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi|Ibn Sa'id]] in the thirteenth century described nearby Merca as one of the three most important cities on the East African coast along with [[Mogadishu]] and [[Barawa]] all serving as the commercial and Islamic centers for the [[Indian Ocean]].<ref>The Cambridge History of Africa, Volume 3 - Page 138</ref>

Following the decline of [[Ajuran Sultanate]]. In the vicinity of Merca, a mysterious group known as the ''El Amir'' made its appearance between 1650 and 1700. According to an account collected by Guillain in 1847, a leader known as Amir, believed to originate from the [[Abgaal]], formed a following or "tribe" which invaded the territory of Merca and expelled the [[Ajuran (clan)|Ajuran]] clan. The El Amir ruled for thirty-four years until the [[Biimaal]] expelled them and definitively occupied Merca.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Benaadir Past Essays in Southern Somali History|first=Lee|last=Cassanelli|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JytqAAAAMAAJ&q=Ajuran+merca |year=1973|publisher=University of Wisconsin Madison}}</ref>

===Early Modern===
One of the most powerful sultanates to have emerged from Southern Somalia called the [[Geledi Sultanate]] centered in [[Afgooye]] in the late 17th century. The Sultanate of Geledi tried to attack and destroy the Bimaal clan many times to try and capture the coastal city of Merca. But the Bimal of Merca managed to defeat the Geledi Sultanate 2 times. In 1843 [[Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim|Yusuf Mahamud]], the Sultan of Geledi, vowed to destroy the Bimaal once and for all and mobilizes the Geledi army. In 1848 the sultan of the Geledi, Yusuf Mahamud was killed at Adaddey Suleyman, a village near Merca, in a battle between the Bimaal and Geledi Sultanates. His son Sultan [[Ahmed Yusuf (Gobroon)|Ahmed Yusuf]] tried to seek revenge but was also killed in 1878 at Agaaran, near Marka by the Bimal. This caused a steady decline in the Geledi Sultanate.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mukhtar|first=Mohamed Haji|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DPwOsOcNy5YC&q=historical+dictionary+geledi&pg=PA34%7C|title=Historical Dictionary of Somalia|date=25 February 2003|publisher= Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810866041|language=en}}</ref>

==== Bimal Revolt ====
The ''Bimal revolt'', ''Bimal resistance'', or ''Banadir resistance'' was a [[guerrilla war]] against the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian Somaliland]] in southern [[Somalia]]. It was fought from the years 1896 to 1926 and largely concentrated in the [[Lower Shebelle]], [[Banadir Region|Banadir]], and [[Middle Shebelle]]. The war was centered around Merka and Danane.

It is compared to the war of the Mad Mullah in northern Somalia.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ciisa-Salwe|first=Cabdisalaam M.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ONotAQAAIAAJ|title=The collapse of the Somali state: the impact of the colonial legacy|date=1996-01-01|publisher=HAAN|isbn=9781874209270|pages=19|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Kusow|first=Abdi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=03QwAQAAIAAJ&q=1886%E2%80%931925.|title=Putting the cart before the horse: contested nationalism and the crisis of the nation-state in Somalia|date=2004-01-01|publisher=Red Sea Press|isbn=9781569022023|pages=82|language=en}}</ref> Named after the [[Bimaal|Bimal]] clan since they were the major element in the resistance.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kusow|first=Abdi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=03QwAQAAIAAJ&q=putting+the+cart+before+the+horse|title=Putting the cart before the horse: contested nationalism and the crisis of the nation-state in Somalia|date=2004-01-01|publisher=Red Sea Press|isbn=9781569022023|pages=86|language=en|quote=the Bimal clan was the major element in the resistance.

====Modern====
In the 1930s a group of [[Italian Somalis]] established residency in Merca. The [[Port of Merca]] was the oldest port in [[Italian Somalia]] and was nicknamed the "port of bananas" due to its status as a key exporter of bananas from Somalia to [[Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://italiacoloniale.com/2015/03/30/la-colonizzazione-agricola-nella-somalia-italiana-192039/|title=La colonization agricola nella Somalia italiana 1920/39|date=March 30, 2015}}</ref> In the city of Merca there was a huge economic development in the 1930s, due mainly to the growing commerce of the port of Merca connected by small railway to the farm area of [[Genale Dorya|Genale]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.delcampe.com/img_large/auction/000/263/923/923_001.jpg|title=Map of Genale (the green area was the farm concessions) and Merca in the 1930s}}</ref>

Merca was abandoned by government forces and captured by [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] in February 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/05/al-shabaab-militants-retake-somali-port-merka-african-union|title=Al-Shabaab militants retake Somali port|date=February 5, 2016|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> It was recaptured by the [[Somali National Army]] along with [[African Union Mission to Somalia|African Union]] troops, a few days later. A small battle was fought in which a Somali soldier, several militants, and four civilians died.<ref>{{cite news|title = Somali troops 'retake' key port city of Merca from al-Shabab - BBC News| work=BBC News | date=6 February 2016 |url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35512034|access-date = 2016-02-06|language = en-GB}}</ref>

The nearest airport to the city is the [[K50 Airport]] in the [[Lower Shebelle]] province.
