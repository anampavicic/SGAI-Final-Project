Located on the shore of [[Table Bay]], the City Bowl area of Cape Town is [[History of Cape Town|the oldest urban area in the Western Cape]], with a significant cultural heritage. It was founded by the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) as a supply station for Dutch ships sailing to [[East Africa]], [[India]], and the [[Far East]]. [[Jan van Riebeeck]]'s arrival on 6 April 1652 established the [[Dutch Cape Colony|VOC Cape Colony]], the first permanent European settlement in South Africa. Cape Town outgrew its original purpose as the first European outpost at the [[Castle of Good Hope]], becoming the economic and cultural hub of the [[Cape Colony]]. Until the [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush]] and the development of Johannesburg, Cape Town was the largest city in southern Africa.

The metropolitan area has a long coastline on the [[Atlantic Ocean]], which includes False Bay, and extends to the [[Hottentots Holland Mountains|Hottentots Holland mountains]] to the east. The [[Table Mountain National Park]] is within the city boundaries and there are several other nature reserves and marine-protected areas within, and adjacent to, the city, protecting the diverse terrestrial and marine natural environment.

===Early period===
[[File:F. Benda-The planting of cross by Bartholomew Dias in 1488-0681 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Portuguese explorer [[Bartolomeu Dias]] planting the cross at [[Cape Point]], 1488.]]
The earliest known remnants of human occupation in the region were found at Peers Cave in [[Fish Hoek]] and have been dated to between 15,000 and 12,000 years old.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antiquityofman.com/Peers_Cave.html |title=The Antiquity of man |publisher=SouthAfrica.info |access-date=15 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301174424/http://www.antiquityofman.com/Peers_Cave.html |archive-date=1 March 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Little is known of the history of the region's first residents, since there is no written history from the area before it was first mentioned by [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese explorer]] [[Bartolomeu Dias]]. Dias, the first European to reach the area, arrived in 1488 and named it "Cape of Storms" ({{Lang|pt|Cabo das Tormentas}}). It was later renamed by [[John II of Portugal]] as "[[Cape of Good Hope]]" ({{Lang|pt|Cabo da Boa Esperança}}) because of the great optimism engendered by the opening of a sea route to the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[East Indies]].

In 1497, Portuguese explorer [[Vasco da Gama]] recorded a sighting of the Cape of Good Hope.

In 1510, at the [[Battle of Salt River]], the Portuguese admiral [[Francisco de Almeida]] and sixty-four of his men were killed and his party was defeated<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Cambridge history of South Africa: 1885–1994 |editor1=Hamilton, Carolyn |editor2=Mbenga, Bernard |editor3=Ross, Robert |date=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521517942 |volume=1 |pages=168–173 |chapter=Khoesan and Immigrants |oclc=778617810}}</ref> by the [[!Uriǁ’aekua]] ("Goringhaiqua" in Dutch approximate spelling) using cattle that were specially trained to respond to whistles and shouts.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Steenkamp |first1=Willem |title=Assegais, drums and dragoons: a military and social history of the Cape, 1510-1806 |date=2012 |publisher=Jonathan Ball Publishers |location=Johannesburg |isbn=9781868424795}}</ref> The !Uriǁ’aekua were one of the so-called [[Khoekhoe]] clans who inhabited the area.

In the late 16th century French, Danish, Dutch and English, but mainly Portuguese, ships regularly continued to stop over in Table Bay en route to the Indies. They traded tobacco, copper, and iron with the [[Khoekhoe language|Khoekhoe]] clans of the region in exchange for fresh meat and other essential travelling provisions.

In 1652, [[Jan van Riebeeck]] and other employees of the [[Dutch East India Company|United East India Company]] ({{langx|nl|Verenigde Oost-indische Compagnie}}, VOC) were sent to the Cape Colony to establish a way-station for ships travelling to the [[Dutch East Indies]], and the [[Fort de Goede Hoop]] (later replaced by the [[Castle of Good Hope]]). The settlement grew slowly during this period, as it was hard to find adequate labour. This labour shortage prompted the local authorities to import enslaved people from [[Indonesia]] and [[Madagascar]]. Many of these people are ancestors of modern-day [[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]] and [[Cape Malays|Cape Malay]] communities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cape-slavery-heritage.iblog.co.za/2009/05/01/coloured-people-of-the-western-cape-have-the-most-diverse-ancestry-in-the-world/ |title=Cape-Slavery-Heritage " Coloured People of the Western Cape have the most Diverse Ancestry in the World :: iBlog |publisher=Cape-slavery-heritage.iblog.co.za |date=1 May 2009 |access-date=17 March 2011}} {{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/governence-projects/slavery/slavery.htm |title=Slavery and early colonisation, South African History Online |publisher=Sahistory.org.za |date=22 September 1927 |access-date=17 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109130722/http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/governence-projects/slavery/slavery.htm |archive-date=9 January 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Under Van Riebeeck and his successors, as VOC commanders and later governors at the Cape, a wide range of agricultural plants were introduced to the Cape. Some of these, including grapes, cereals, ground nuts, potatoes, apples and citrus, had a large and lasting influence on the societies and economies of the region.<ref>Pooley, S. 'Jan van Riebeeck as Pioneering Explorer and Conservator of Natural Resources at the Cape of Good Hope (1652–62),' Environment and History 15 (2009): 3–33. {{doi|10.3197/096734009X404644}}</ref>

===British period===
{{See also|Cape Colony}}[[File:Adderley Street, Cape Town, looking NE - ca. 1897.jpg|thumb|[[Adderley Street]] in 1897 was an important commercial hub in Cape Town at a time when the city was the most important centre of economic activity in the Southern Africa region.]]

With the [[Dutch Republic]] being transformed into [[First French Republic|Revolutionary France]]'s vassal [[Batavian Republic]], Great Britain moved to take control of Dutch colonies, including the colonial possessions of the VOC.

Britain [[Invasion of the Cape Colony|captured Cape Town in 1795]], but it was returned to the Dutch by treaty in 1803. British forces occupied the Cape again in 1806 following the [[Battle of Blaauwberg]] when the Batavian Republic allied with Britain's rival, France, during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Following the conclusion of the war Cape Town was permanently ceded to the United Kingdom in the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]].

The city became the capital of the newly formed [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]], whose territory expanded very substantially through the 1800s, partially as a result of [[Xhosa Wars|numerous wars]] with the [[Xhosa people|amaXhosa]] on the colony's eastern frontier.  In 1833 slavery was [[Slavery in South Africa#Abolition|abolished in the colony]] freeing over 5500 slaves in the city, almost a third of the city's population at the time.<ref name="Martin 1836 113">{{Cite book |last=Martin |first=Robert Montgomery |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ifk9AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA112 |title=The British Colonial Library: In 12 volumes |date=1836 |publisher=Mortimer |pages=113 |language=en}}</ref> The [[Convict crisis|Convict Crisis]] of 1849, marked by substantial civil upheaval, bolstered the push for self-governance in the Cape.<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal |last=Anderson |first=Clare |date=2016-05-03 |title=Convicts, Carcerality and Cape Colony Connections in the 19th Century |journal=Journal of Southern African Studies |language=en |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=429–442 |doi=10.1080/03057070.2016.1175128 |issn=0305-7070|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name=":8">RFM Immelman: ''Men of Good Hope, 1804-1954''.

In 1859 the first railway line was built by the [[Cape Government Railways]] and a system of railways rapidly expanded in the 1870s. The discovery of diamonds in [[Griqualand West]] in 1867, and the [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush]] in 1886, prompted a flood of immigration into South Africa.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mbenga |first=Bernard |title=New History of South Africa |publisher=Tafelberg, South Africa, 2007 |url=http://www.tafelberg.com/Books/2652 |access-date=18 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422132145/http://www.tafelberg.com/Books/2652 |archive-date=22 April 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> In 1895 the city's first public power station, the [[Graaff Electric Lighting Works]], was opened.

Conflicts between the [[Boer Republics|Boer republics]] in the interior and the British colonial government resulted in the [[Second Boer War]] of 1899–1902. Britain's victory in this war led to the formation of a united South Africa. From 1891 to 1901, the city's population more than doubled from 67,000 to 171,000.<ref name="C1875">{{cite book |author1=Worden, Nigel |title=Cape Town: The Making of a City |author2=van Hyningen, Elizabeth |author3=Bickford-Smith, Vivian |publisher=David Philip Publishers |year=1998 |isbn=0-86486-435-3 |location=Claremont, Cape Town, South Africa |pages=212}}</ref>

In 1910, Britain established the [[Union of South Africa]], which unified the Cape Colony with the two defeated Boer Republics and the British [[colony of Natal]]. Cape Town became the legislative capital of the Union, and later of the [[Republic of South Africa]].

By the time of the [[South African National Census of 1936|1936 census]], Johannesburg had overtaken Cape Town as the largest city in the country.

In 1945 the expansion of the [[Foreshore, Cape Town|Cape Town foreshore]] was completed adding an additional {{cvt|194|ha}} to the [[City Bowl]] area to the city centre.<ref name="sahris_sahra_org_za" />

==== Apartheid era ====
Prior to the mid-twentieth century, Cape Town was one of the most racially integrated cities in South Africa.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bickford-Smith |first=Vivian |date=1995 |title=South African Urban History, Racial Segregation and the Unique Case of Cape Town? |journal=Journal of Southern African Studies |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=63–78 |issn=0305-7070 |jstor=2637331 |doi=10.1080/03057079508708433}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.oapen.org/download?type=document&docid=628130#page=82 |title=Burdened by race: Coloured identities in southern Africa |last=Adhikari |first=Mohamed |publisher=UCT Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-92051-660-4 |location=Cape Town |pages=51 |access-date=26 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720174913/http://oapen.org/download?type=document&docid=628130#page=82 |archive-date=20 July 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> In the [[1948 South African general election|1948 national elections]], the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] won on a platform of ''[[apartheid]]'' (racial segregation) under the slogan of "[[swart gevaar]]" (Afrikaans for "black danger"). This led to the erosion and eventual abolition of the [[Cape Qualified Franchise|Cape's multiracial franchise]].

In 1950, the apartheid government first introduced the [[Group Areas Act]], which classified and segregated urban areas according to race. Formerly multi-racial suburbs of Cape Town were either purged of residents deemed unlawful by apartheid legislation, or demolished. The most infamous example of this in Cape Town was the suburb of [[District Six, Cape Town|District Six]]. After it was declared a whites-only area in 1965, all housing there was demolished and over 60,000 residents were forcibly removed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southafrica.info/ess_info/sa_glance/history/districtsix.htm |publisher=SouthAfrica.info |title=Recalling District Six |date=19 August 2003 |access-date=13 June 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206234327/http://www.southafrica.info/ess_info/sa_glance/history/districtsix.htm |archive-date=6 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Many of these residents were relocated to the [[Cape Flats]].

The earliest of the Cape Flats forced removals saw the expulsion of Black South Africans to the [[Langa, Western Cape|Langa]], Cape Town's first and oldest township, in line with the 1923 [[Natives Urban Areas Act|Native Urban Areas Act]].

Under apartheid, the Cape was considered a "[[Coloured]] labour preference area", to the exclusion of "[[Bantu-speaking peoples of South Africa|Bantus]]", i.e. Black Africans. The implementation of this policy was widely opposed by trade unions, civil society and opposition parties. It is notable that this policy was not advocated for by any Coloured political group, and its implementation was a unilateral decision by the apartheid government.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://digitalcollections.lib.uct.ac.za/coloured-labour-preference-area-policy-paper-presented-cape-western-region-national-conference-1983 |title="The Coloured Labour Preference Area Policy"- Paper Presented by Cape Western Region to National Conference 1983 |last=Sash |first=Black |date=3 November 1983 |website=National texts, 1955–1994 |access-date=16 December 2019 |archive-date=16 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191216183957/https://digitalcollections.lib.uct.ac.za/coloured-labour-preference-area-policy-paper-presented-cape-western-region-national-conference-1983 |url-status=live}}</ref> During the student-led [[Soweto uprising|Soweto Uprising]] of June 1976, school students from [[Langa, Western Cape|Langa]], [[Gugulethu]] and [[Nyanga, Western Cape|Nyanga]] in Cape Town reacted to the news of the protests against Bantu Education by organising gatherings and marches of their own.

Cape Town has been home to many leaders of the [[Internal resistance to apartheid|anti-apartheid movement]]. In [[Table Bay]], {{cvt|10|km|0|abbr=off}} from the city is [[Robben Island]]. This [[Maximum Security Prison, Robben Island|penitentiary island]] was the site of a maximum security prison where many famous apartheird-era political prisoners served long prison sentences. Famous prisoners include activist, lawyer and future president [[Nelson Mandela]] who served 18 of his 27 years of imprisonment on the island, as well as two other future presidents, [[Kgalema Motlanthe]] and [[Jacob Zuma]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2013-06-30 |title=FLOTUS Travel Journal: Robben Island, An Experience We Will Never Forget |url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2013/06/30/flotus-travel-journal-robben-island-experience-we-will-never-forget |access-date=2024-04-10 |website=whitehouse.gov |language=en}}</ref>

In one of the most famous moments marking the end of apartheid, Nelson Mandela made his first public speech since his imprisonment, from the balcony of [[Cape Town City Hall]], hours after being released on 11 February 1990.

[[File:Table Mountain Cape Town South Africa 19Mar2018 SkySat.jpg|thumb|Satellite image 3D of the [[City Bowl]] and Table Mountain]]
Cape Town is located at latitude 33.55° S (approximately the same as [[Sydney]] and [[Buenos Aires]] and equivalent to [[Casablanca]] and [[Los Angeles]] in the northern hemisphere) and longitude 18.25° E.

[[Table Mountain]], with its near vertical cliffs and flat-topped summit over {{cvt|1000|m|ft}} high, and with [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]] and [[Lion's Head (Cape Town)|Lion's Head]] on either side, together form a dramatic mountainous backdrop enclosing the central area of Cape Town, the so-called [[City Bowl]]. A thin strip of cloud, known colloquially as the "tablecloth" ("Karos" in [[Afrikaans]]), sometimes forms on top of the mountain. To the immediate south of the city, the [[Cape Peninsula]] is a scenic mountainous spine jutting {{cvt|40|km}} southward into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and terminating at [[Cape Point]].

There are over 70 peaks above {{cvt|300|m}} within [[City of Cape Town|Cape Town's official metropolitan limits]]. Many of the city's suburbs lie on the large plain called the [[Cape Flats]], which extends over {{cvt|50|km|-1}} to the east and joins the peninsula to the mainland. The Cape Town region is characterised by an extensive coastline, rugged mountain ranges, coastal plains and inland valleys.

=== Extent ===
The extent of Cape Town has varied considerably over time. It originated as a small settlement at the foot of Table Mountain and has grown beyond its city limits as a [[metropolitan area]] to encompass the entire [[Cape Peninsula]] to the south, the [[Cape Flats]], the [[Helderberg]] basin and part of the Steenbras catchment area to the east, and the Tygerberg hills, Blouberg and other areas to the north. [[Robben Island]] in Table Bay is also part of Cape Town. It is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and False Bay to the south. To the north and east, the extent is demarcated by boundaries of neighbouring municipalities within the Western Cape province.

The official boundaries of the city proper extend between the [[City Bowl]] and the Atlantic Seaboard to the east and the [[Southern Suburbs, Cape Town|Southern Suburbs]] to the south. The [[City of Cape Town]], the [[metropolitan municipality]] that takes its name from the city covers the Greater Cape Town [[metropolitan area]], known as the Cape Metropole, extending beyond the city proper itself to include a number of satellite towns, suburbs and rural areas such as [[Atlantis, South Africa|Atlantis]], [[Bellville, South Africa|Bellville]], [[Blouberg, Western Cape|Blouberg]], [[Brackenfell]], [[Durbanville]], [[Goodwood, Western Cape|Goodwood]], [[Gordon's Bay]], [[Hout Bay]], [[Khayelitsha]], [[Kraaifontein]], [[Kuils River|Kuilsrivier]], [[Macassar, Western Cape|Macassar]], [[Melkbosstrand]], [[Milnerton]], [[Muizenberg]], [[Noordhoek, Cape Town|Noordhoek]], [[Parow, South Africa|Parow]], [[Philadelphia, South Africa|Philadelphia]], [[Simon's Town]], [[Somerset West]] and [[Strand, Western Cape|Strand]] among others.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Census 2011: Metropolitan Municipality: City of Cape Town |url=https://census2011.adrianfrith.com/place/199 |access-date=2023-06-07 |website=census2011.adrianfrith.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Census 2011: Main Place: Cape Town |url=https://census2011.adrianfrith.com/place/199041 |access-date=2023-06-07 |website=census2011.adrianfrith.com}}</ref>

The [[Cape Peninsula]] is {{cvt|52|km|-1}} long from [[Mouille Point]] in the north to Cape Point in the south,<ref name="Map 3318" /> with an area of about {{cvt|470|km2|sqmi}}, and it displays more topographical variety than other similar sized areas in southern Africa, and consequently spectacular scenery. There are diverse low-nutrient soils, large rocky outcrops, scree slopes, a mainly rocky coastline with embayed beaches, and considerable local variation in climatic conditions.<ref name="Cowling et al 1996" /> The sedimentary rocks of the [[Cape Supergroup]], of which parts of the Graafwater and Peninsula Formations remain, were uplifted between 280 and 21S million years ago, and were largely eroded away during the Mesozoic. The region was geologically stable during the Tertiary, which has led to slow denudation of the durable sandstones. Erosion rate and drainage has been influenced by fault lines and fractures, leaving remnant steep-sided massifs like Table Mountain surrounded by flatter slopes of deposits of the eroded material overlaying the older rocks,<ref name="Cowling et al 1996" />

There are two internationally notable landmarks, [[Table Mountain]] and [[Cape Point]], at opposite ends of the Peninsula Mountain Chain, with the [[Cape Flats]] and [[False Bay]] to the east and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west. The landscape is dominated by sandstone plateaux and ridges, which generally drop steeply at their margins to the surrounding debris slopes, interrupted by a major gap at the Fish Hoek–Noordhoek valley. In the south much of the area is a low sandstone plateau with sand dunes. Maximum altitude is 1113&nbsp;m on Table Mountain.<ref name="Cowling et al 1996" /> The Cape Flats (Afrikaans: Kaapse Vlakte) is a flat, low-lying, sandy area, area to the east the Cape Peninsula, and west of the Helderberg much of which was wetland and dunes within recent history. To the north are the Tygerberg Hills and the Stellenbosch district.

The [[Helderberg]] area of Greater Cape Town, previously known as the "Hottentots-Holland" area, is mostly residential, but also a wine-producing area east of the Cape Flats, west of the Hottentots Holland mountain range and south of the Helderberg mountain, from which it gets its current name. The Helderberg consists of the previous municipalities of Somerset West, Strand, Gordons Bay and a few other towns. Industry and commerce is largely in service of the area. After the Cape Peninsula, Helderberg is the next most mountainous part of Greater Cape Town, bordered to the north and east by the highest peaks in the region along the watershed of the Helderberg and Hottentots Holland Mountains, which are part of the Cape Fold Belt with [[Cape Supergroup]] strata on a basement of Tygerberg Formation rocks intruded by part of the Stellenbosch granite pluton. The region includes the entire catchment of the Lourens and Sir Lowry's rivers, separated by the Schapenberg hill, and a small part of the catchment of the Eerste River to the west. The Helderberg is ecologically highly diverse, rivaling the Cape Peninsula, and has its own endemic ecoregions and several conservation areas.

To the east of the Hottentots Holland mountains is the valley of the Steenbras River, in which the [[Steenbras Dam]] was built as a water supply for Cape Town. The dam has been supplemented by several other dams around the western Cape, some of them considerably larger. This is almost entirely a conservation area, of high biodiversity. [[Bellville, South Africa|Bellville]], [[Brackenfell]], [[Durbanville]], [[Kraaifontein]], [[Goodwood, Western Cape|Goodwood]] and [[Parow, South Africa|Parow]] are a few of the towns that make up the [[Northern Suburbs, Cape Town|Northern Suburbs]] of Cape Town. In current popular culture these areas are often referred to as being beyond the "[[boerewors]] curtain," a play on the term "[[Iron Curtain|iron curtain]]."

[[UNESCO]] declared [[Robben Island]] in the Western Cape a [[List of World Heritage Sites in Africa|World Heritage Site]] in 1999. Robben Island is located in Table Bay, some {{cvt|6|km}} west of Bloubergstrand, a coastal suburb north of Cape Town, and stands some 30m above sea level. Robben Island has been used as a [[Maximum Security Prison, Robben Island|prison]] where people were isolated, banished, and exiled for nearly 400 years. It was also used as a [[Leprosy|leper]] colony, a post office, a grazing ground, a mental hospital, and an outpost.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/robben-island |title=Robben Island |date=14 July 2011 |website=South African History Online |access-date=24 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401181709/https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/robben-island |archive-date=1 April 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Geology===
{{Main|Geology of Cape Town}}
[[File:Geological map of the Cape Peninsula and False Bay.png|thumb|upright|left|Geological map of the Cape Peninsula and False Bay]]

The [[Cape Peninsula]] is a rocky and mountainous [[peninsula]] that juts out into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at the south-western extremity of the continent. At its tip is Cape Point and the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. The peninsula forms the west side of False Bay and the Cape Flats. On the east side are the Helderberg and Hottentots Holland mountains. The three main rock formations are the late-[[Precambrian]] Malmebury group (sedimentary and metamorphic rock), the Cape Granite suit, comprising the huge Peninsula, Kuilsrivier-Helderberg, and Stellenbosch batholiths, that were intruded into the Malmesbury Group about 630 million years ago, and the [[Cape Fold Belt#Table Mountain group|Table Mountain group]] sandstones that were deposited on the eroded surface of the granite and Malmesbury series basement about 450 million years ago.

The sand, silt and mud deposits were lithified by pressure and then folded during the Cape Orogeny to form the [[Cape Fold Belt]], which extends in an arc along the western and southern coasts. The present landscape is due to prolonged erosion having carved out deep valleys, removing parts of the once continuous Table Mountain Group sandstone cover from over the Cape Flats and False Bay, and leaving high residual mountain ridges.<ref name="Compton 2004" />

At times the sea covered the Cape Flats and [[Noordhoek, Cape Town|Noordhoek]] valley and the Cape Peninsula was then a group of islands. During glacial periods the sea level dropped to expose the bottom of False Bay to weathering and erosion, with the last major regression leaving the entire bottom of False Bay exposed. During this period an extensive system of dunes was formed on the sandy floor of False Bay. At this time the drainage outlets lay between Rocky Bank Cape Point to the west, and between Rocky Bank and Hangklip Ridge to the east, with the watershed roughly along the line of the contact zone east of Seal Island and Whittle Rock.<ref name="Compton 2004" /><ref name="Brown and Magoba 2009 part 1" />{{rp|Ch2}}

Winter, which lasts from June to September, may see large cold fronts entering for limited periods from the Atlantic Ocean with significant [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and strong north-westerly winds. Winter months in the city average a maximum of {{cvt|18|C|0}} and minimum of {{cvt|8.5|C|0}}. Winters are [[snow]] and [[frost]] free, except on Table Mountain and on other mountain peaks, where light accumulation of snow and frost can sometimes occur.<ref name="WMO">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldweather.org/035/c00138.htm |title=World Weather Information Service – Cape Town |access-date=4 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426062632/http://www.worldweather.org/035/c00138.htm |archive-date=26 April 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>
Total annual rainfall in the city averages {{cvt|515|mm|in|1}} although in the [[Southern Suburbs, Cape Town|Southern Suburbs]], close to the mountains, rainfall is significantly higher and averages closer to {{cvt|1000|mm|in|1|abbr=}}.

Summer, which lasts from December to March, is warm and dry with an average maximum of {{cvt|26|°C|0}} and minimum of {{cvt|16|°C|0}}. The region can get uncomfortably hot when the [[Berg wind|Berg Wind]], meaning "mountain wind", blows from the [[Karoo]] interior. Spring and summer generally feature a strong wind from the south-east, known locally as the south-{{not a typo|easter}} or the [[Cape Doctor]], so called because it blows air pollution away. This wind is caused by a persistent [[Pressure system#High-pressure system|high-pressure system]] over the [[South Atlantic Ocean|South Atlantic]] to the west of Cape Town, known as the [[South Atlantic High]], which shifts latitude seasonally, following the sun, and influencing the strength of the fronts and their northward reach. Cape Town receives about 3,100 hours of sunshine per year.<ref name=NOAA/>

Water temperatures range greatly, between {{cvt|10|°C|0}} on the Atlantic Seaboard, to over {{cvt|22|°C|0}} in [[False Bay]]. Average annual ocean surface temperatures are between {{cvt|13|°C|0}} on the Atlantic Seaboard (similar to Californian waters, such as [[San Francisco]] or [[Big Sur]]), and {{cvt|17|°C|0}} in False Bay (similar to Northern Mediterranean temperatures, such as [[Nice]] or [[Monte Carlo]]).

Unlike other parts of the country the city does not have many [[thunderstorm]]s, and most of those that do occur, happen around October to December and March to April.

Moreover, according to the 2022 [[IPCC Sixth Assessment Report]], Cape Town is one of 12 major African cities ([[Abidjan]], [[Alexandria]], [[Algiers]], Cape Town, [[Casablanca]], [[Dakar]], [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Durban]], [[Lagos]], [[Lomé]], [[Luanda]] and [[Maputo]]) which would be the most severely affected by future [[sea level rise]]. It estimates that they would collectively sustain cumulative damages of US$65 billion under RCP 4.5 and US$86.5 billion for the high-emission scenario RCP 8.5 by the year 2050. Additionally, RCP 8.5 combined with the hypothetical impact from [[marine ice sheet instability]] at high levels of warming would involve up to US$137.5 billion in damages,{{Clarify|how would the damages occur?

[[File:Sea surface temperatures False Bay.png|thumb|left|upright=2.2|Charts of sea surface temperature in and near False Bay in summer and winter<ref name="Pfaff et al 2019" />]]
Cape Town's coastal water ranges from cold to mild, and the difference between the two sides of the peninsula can be dramatic. While the Atlantic Seaboard averages annual sea surface temperatures around {{cvt|13|°C|°F}}, the [[False Bay]] coast is much warmer, averaging between {{cvt|16|and|17|C|F}} annually.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}} In summer, False Bay water averages slightly over {{cvt|20|°C|°F}}, with {{cvt|22|°C|°F}} an occasional high. Beaches located on the Atlantic Coast tend to have colder water due to the wind driven upwellings which contribute to the [[Benguela Current]] which originates off the Cape Peninsula, while the water at False Bay beaches may occasionally be warmer by up to {{cvt|10|C-change|0}} at the same time in summer.

In summer False Bay is thermally stratified, with a vertical temperature variation of 5 to 9˚C between the warmer surface water and cooler depths below 50&nbsp;m, while in winter the water column is at nearly constant temperature at all depths. The development of a [[thermocline]] is strongest around late December and peaks in late summer to early autumn.<ref name="Coleman 2019" />{{rp|8}} In summer the south easterly winds generate a zone of upwelling near [[Pringle Bay|Cape Hangklip]], where surface water temperatures can be 6 to 7&nbsp;°C colder than the surrounding areas, and bottom temperatures below 12&nbsp;°C.<ref name="Coleman 2019" />{{rp|10}}

In the summer to early autumn (January–March), cold water upwelling near Cape Hangklip causes a strong surface temperature gradient between the south-western and north-eastern corners of the bay. In winter the surface temperature tends to be much the same everywhere. In the northern sector surface temperature varies a bit more (13 to 22&nbsp;°C) than in the south (14 to 20&nbsp;°C) during the year.<ref name="Pfaff et al 2019" />

Surface temperature variation from year to year is linked to the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]]. During El Niño years the South Atlantic high is shifted, reducing the south-easterly winds, so upwelling and evaporative cooling are reduced and sea surface temperatures throughout the bay are warmer, while in La Niña years there is more wind and upwelling and consequently lower temperatures. Surface water heating during El Niño increases vertical stratification. The relationship is not linear.<ref name="Pfaff et al 2019" /> Occasionally eddies from the Agulhas current will bring warmer water and vagrant sea life carried from the south and east coasts into False Bay.

Table Mountain has an unusually rich biodiversity. Its vegetation consists predominantly of several different types of the unique and rich Cape [[Fynbos]]. The main vegetation type is endangered [[Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos]], but [[critically endangered]] [[Peninsula Granite Fynbos]], [[Peninsula Shale Renosterveld]] and [[Afromontane|Afromontane forest]] occur in smaller portions on the mountain.

Rapid [[population growth]] and [[Urbanisation|urban sprawl]] has covered much of these ecosystems with development. Consequently, Cape Town now has over 300 [[threatened]] plant species and 13 which are now [[extinct]]. The [[Cape Peninsula]], which lies entirely within the city of Cape Town, has the highest concentration of [[threatened species]] of any continental area of equivalent size in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://perceval.bio.nau.edu/downloads/grail/climate_seminar/section2/Hannah_etal05.pdf |title=The View from The Cape: Extinction Risk, Protected Areas, and Climate Change |publisher=Perceval.bio.nau.edu |access-date=24 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825180525/http://perceval.bio.nau.edu/downloads/grail/climate_seminar/section2/Hannah_etal05.pdf |archive-date=25 August 2013}}</ref>

Cape Town reached first place in the 2019 [[iNaturalist City Nature Challenge]] in two out of the three categories: Most Observations, and Most Species.

==Government==
{{Main|City of Cape Town}}
{{Politics of Western Cape}}
Cape Town is governed by a 231-member city council elected in a system of [[mixed-member proportional representation]]. The city is divided into 116 [[ward (South Africa)|wards]], each of which elects a councillor by [[first-past-the-post voting]]. The remaining 115 councillors are elected from [[party list]]s so that the total number of councillors for each party is proportional to the number of votes received by that party.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Piombo |first=J. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbTFAAAAQBAJ&q=%22cape+town%22+councillor+election+%22party+lists%22+first-past-the-post&pg=PA203 |title=Institutions, Ethnicity, and Political Mobilization in South Africa |date=3 August 2009 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-230-62382-8 |access-date=9 November 2020 |archive-date=27 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210427045402/https://books.google.com/books?id=gbTFAAAAQBAJ&q=%22cape+town%22+councillor+election+%22party+lists%22+first-past-the-post&pg=PA203 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Anciano |first1=Fiona |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8yVxDwAAQBAJ&q=%22cape+town%22+116+wards&pg=PT51 |title=Democracy Disconnected: Participation and Governance in a City of the South |last2=Piper |first2=Laurence |date=3 October 2018 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-429-79429-2 |access-date=9 November 2020 |archive-date=26 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210426203322/https://books.google.com/books?id=8yVxDwAAQBAJ&q=%22cape+town%22+116+wards&pg=PT51 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Water supply===
{{Main|Western Cape Water Supply System}}
The '''Western Cape Water Supply System''' (WCWSS) is a complex water supply system in the [[Western Cape]] region of [[South Africa]], comprising an inter-linked system of six main dams, pipelines, tunnels and distribution networks, and a number of minor dams, some owned and operated by the [[Department of Water and Sanitation]] and some by the [[City of Cape Town]].<ref name="Kasrils">[http://www.info.gov.za/speeches/2003/03041609461001.htm Address by Mr Ronnie Kasrils, MP, minister of Water Affairs and Forestry, at the Berg Water Project signing ceremony on 15 April 2003, in Cape Town], accessed on 11 December 2009</ref>

====Water crisis of 2017 to 2018====
{{Main|Cape Town water crisis}}
[[File:Water Crisis.jpg|thumb|upright|Water crisis warning in Cape Town in 2018]]
The Cape Town water crisis of 2017 to 2018 was a period of severe water shortage in the [[Western Cape]] region, most notably affecting the [[City of Cape Town]]. While dam water levels had been declining since 2015, the Cape Town water crisis peaked during mid-2017 to mid-2018 when water levels hovered between 15 and 30 percent of total dam capacity.

In late 2017, there were first mentions of plans for "Day Zero", a shorthand reference for the day when the water level of the major dams supplying the city could fall below 13.5 percent.<ref name="USA today" /><ref name="Globe and Mail" /><ref name="Poplak 2018" /> "Day Zero" would mark the start of Level 7 water restrictions, when municipal water supplies would be largely switched off and it was envisioned that residents could have to queue for their daily ration of water. If this had occurred, it would have made the City of Cape Town the first major city in the world to run out of water.<ref name="Booysen et al 2019" /><ref name="Booysen et al 2019a" />

The city of Cape Town implemented significant water restrictions in a bid to curb water usage, and succeeded in reducing its daily water usage by more than half to around 500 million litres (130,000,000 US gal) per day in March 2018.<ref name="Narrandes 2018" /> The fall in water usage led the city to postpone its estimate for "Day Zero", and strong rains starting in June 2018 led to dam levels recovering.<ref name="Myburgh 2018" /> In September 2018, with dam levels close to 70 percent, the city began easing water restrictions, indicating that the worst of the water crisis was over.<ref name="reduce-sep2018" /> Good rains in 2020 effectively broke the drought and resulting water shortage when dam levels reached 95 percent.<ref name="After drought" /> Concerns have been raised, however, that unsustainble demand and limited water supply could result in future drought events.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Day Zero still looms over Cape Town |url=https://climate.mit.edu/posts/day-zero-still-looms-over-cape-town |access-date=2023-04-20 |website=MIT Climate Portal |language=en}}</ref>

The [[Shosholoza Meyl]] is the passenger rail operations of [[Spoornet]] and operates one long-distance passenger rail services from Cape Town as of 2024: a weekly service to and from [[Johannesburg]] via [[Kimberley, South Africa|Kimberley]]. These trains terminate at [[Cape Town railway station]] and make a stop at [[Bellville railway station|Bellville]]. Cape Town also terminates 2 luxury tourist train routes as of 2024 operated by the [[Ceres Rail Company]], traveling from the [[V&A Waterfront|Waterfront]] to [[Simon's Town]] and [[Grabouw]] respectively.

[[Metrorail (Western Cape)|Metrorail]] operates a [[commuter rail]] service in Cape Town and the surrounding area. The Metrorail network consists of 96 stations throughout the suburbs and outskirts of Cape Town.

====Road====
Cape Town is the origin of three [[National Roads in South Africa|national roads]]. The [[N1 (South Africa)|N1]] and [[N2 (South Africa)|N2]] begin in the foreshore area near the City Centre and the [[N7 (South Africa)|N7]], which runs North toward [[Namibia]]. The N1 runs East-North-East from Cape Town through the towns of [[Goodwood, Western Cape|Goodwood]], [[Parow, South Africa|Parow]], [[Bellville, Cape Town|Bellville]], [[Brackenfell, Cape Town|Brackenfell]] and [[Kraaifontein]] before continuing towards [[Paarl]]. It connects Cape Town to major cities further inland, namely [[Bloemfontein]], [[Johannesburg]], and [[Pretoria]] An older at-grade road, the [[R101 road (South Africa)|R101]], runs parallel to the N1 from Bellville. The N2 runs East-South-East through [[Rondebosch]], [[Guguletu]], [[Khayelitsha]], [[Macassar, Western Cape|Macassar]] to [[Somerset West]]. It becomes a multiple-carriageway, at-grade road from the intersection with the [[R44 road (South Africa)|R44]] onward. The N2 continues east along the coast, linking Cape Town with Somerset West and the coastal cities of [[Mossel Bay]], [[George, Western Cape|George]], [[Port Elizabeth]], [[East London, South Africa|East London]] and [[Durban]]. An older at-grade road, the [[R102 (South Africa)|R102]], runs parallel to the N1 initially, before veering south at Bellville, to join the N2 at Somerset West via the towns of [[Kuils River|Kuilsrivier]] and [[Eerste River, Western Cape|Eersterivier]]. The N7 originates from the N1 at Wingfield Interchange near Edgemead. It begins, initially as a highway, but becoming an at-grade road from the intersection with the M5 onward.
[[File:Cape_Town_N2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[N2 (South Africa)|N2]] as it enters the city centre.]]

There are also a number of [[Provincial route (South Africa)|regional routes]] linking Cape Town with surrounding areas. The [[R27 road (South Africa)|R27]] originates from the N1 near the Foreshore and runs north parallel to the N7, but nearer to the coast. It passes through the suburbs of [[Milnerton, Cape Town|Milnerton]], [[Table View, Cape Town|Table View]] and [[Bloubergstrand, Cape Town|Bloubergstrand]] and links the city to the West Coast, ending at the town of [[Velddrif]]. The [[R44 road (South Africa)|R44]] enters the east of the metro from the north, from [[Stellenbosch]]. It connects Stellenbosch to Somerset West, then crosses the N2 to [[Strand, Western Cape|Strand]] and [[Gordon's Bay]]. It exits the metro heading south hugging the coast, leading to the towns of [[Betty's Bay]] and [[Kleinmond]].

Of the three-digit routes, the [[R300 road (South Africa)|R300]] is an expressway linking the N1 at [[Brackenfell]] to the N2 near [[Mitchells Plain]] and the [[Cape Town International Airport]]. The [[R302 road (South Africa)|R302]] runs from the R102 in Bellville, heading north across the N1 through [[Durbanville]] leaving the metro to [[Malmesbury, Western Cape|Malmesbury]]. The [[R304 road (South Africa)|R304]] enters the northern limits of the metro from Stellenbosch, running NNW before veering west to cross the N7 at [[Philadelphia, Western Cape|Philadelphia]] to end at [[Atlantis, Western Cape|Atlantis]] at a junction with the [[R307 road (South Africa)|R307]]. This R307 starts north of [[Koeberg]] from the R27 and, after meeting the R304, continues north to [[Darling, Western Cape|Darling]]. The [[R310 road (South Africa)|R310]] originates from [[Muizenberg]] and runs along the coast, to the south of Mitchell's Plain and Khayelitsha, before veering north-east, crossing the N2 west of Macassar, and exiting the metro heading to Stellenbosch.

Cape Town, like most South African cities, uses [[Metropolitan Routes in Cape Town|Metropolitan]] or "M" routes for important intra-city routes, a layer below National (N) roads and Regional (R) routes. Each city's M roads are independently numbered. Most are at-grade roads. The [[M3 (Cape Town)|M3]] splits from the N2 and runs to the south along the eastern slopes of Table Mountain, connecting the City Bowl with [[Muizenberg]]. Except for a section between Rondebosch and Newlands that has at-grade intersections, this route is a highway. The [[M5 (Cape Town)|M5]] splits from the N1 further east than the M3, and links the Cape Flats to the CBD. It is a highway as far as the interchange with the M68 at Ottery, before continuing as an at-grade road. Cape Town has the worst traffic congestion in [[South Africa]].<ref>{{cite web |title=TomTom Traffic Index |url=http://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/trafficindex/#/list |access-date=29 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201021928/https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/trafficindex/#/list |archive-date=1 December 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=R750 million to fight traffic in SA's most congested city |url=http://businesstech.co.za/news/general/103039/r750-million-to-fight-traffic-in-sas-most-congested-city/ |access-date=29 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208104036/http://businesstech.co.za/news/general/103039/r750-million-to-fight-traffic-in-sas-most-congested-city/ |archive-date=8 December 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

{{main|MyCiTi}}
[[File:MyCiti_BRT_Adderley_station_(21812360016).jpg|thumb|[[MyCiTi]] station and bus]]
Cape Town has a public transport system in about 10% of the city, running north to south along the west coastline of the city, comprising Phase 1 of the IRT system. This is known as the MyCiTi service.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://myciti.org.za/en/home/ |title=MyCiTi |access-date=29 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225063521/http://myciti.org.za/en/home/ |archive-date=25 December 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

MyCiTi Phase 1 includes services linking the Airport to the Cape Town inner city, as well as the following areas: [[Bloubergstrand|Blouberg]] / [[Table View]], [[Dunoon, Cape Town|Dunoon]], [[Atlantis, Western Cape|Atlantis]] and [[Melkbosstrand]], [[Milnerton, Cape Town|Milnerton]], Paarden Eiland, [[Century City, Cape Town|Century City]], [[Salt River, Cape Town|Salt River]] and [[Walmer Estate, Cape Town|Walmer Estate]], and all suburbs of the [[City Bowl]] and [[#Atlantic Seaboard|Atlantic Seaboard]] all the way to [[Llandudno, Cape Town|Llandudno]] and [[Hout Bay, Cape Town|Hout Bay]].{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}

The MyCiTi N2 Express service consists of four routes each linking the Cape Town inner city and [[Khayelitsha]] and [[Mitchells Plain]] on the [[Cape Flats]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=MyCiTi {{!}} N2 Express services to restart on 19 February 2022 |url=https://www.myciti.org.za/en/routes-stops/n2-express/ |access-date=2024-03-03 |website=www.myciti.org.za |language=en-US}}</ref>

It offers [[Accessibility#Transportation|universal access]] through level boarding and numerous other measures, and requires cashless fare payment using the [[EMV]] compliant smart card system, called myconnect. Headway of services (i.e. the time between buses on the same route) range from three to twenty minutes in peak times to an hour in off-peak times.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}

====Taxis====
[[File:Cape_Town_Taxicab_in_Campsbay.jpg|thumb|left|A fleet of privately-owned taxis in [[Camps Bay]]]]
Cape Town has various kinds of taxis available, including those obtained through ride-hailing services such as [[Bolt (company)|Bolt]] and [[Uber]]. 

Taxis are either [[taxicab|metered taxis]] or [[minibus taxi]]s. Metered taxis can be found at transport hubs as well as other tourist establishments, while minibus taxis can be found at taxi ranks, and, commonly, travelling along main streets.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Public transport {{!}} Transport and Public Works |url=https://www.westerncape.gov.za/tpw/public-transport |access-date=2023-05-29 |website=www.westerncape.gov.za}}</ref> Minibus taxis can be hailed from the road.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The best ways to get around Cape Town: cycling, walking and safety |url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/getting-around-cape-town |access-date=2023-05-29 |website=Lonely Planet |language=en}}</ref>

Cape Town metered taxi cabs mostly operate in the city bowl, suburbs and Cape Town International Airport areas. Large companies that operate fleets of cabs can be reached by phone and are cheaper than the single operators that apply for hire from taxi ranks and [[Victoria and Alfred Waterfront]]. There are about one thousand meter taxis in Cape Town. Their rates vary from R8 per kilometre to about R15 per kilometre. The larger taxi companies in Cape Town are Excite Taxis, Cabnet and Intercab and single operators are reachable by cellular phone. The seven seated Toyota Avanza are the most popular with larger Taxi companies. Meter cabs are mostly used by tourists and are safer to use than minibus taxis.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}

Minibus taxis are the standard form of transport for the majority of the population who cannot afford private vehicles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cape-town.org/directory.asp?McatId=8 |publisher=CapeTown.org |title=Transport |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128184051/http://www.cape-town.org/directory.asp?McatId=8 |archive-date=28 November 2011}}</ref> Although essential, these taxis are often poorly maintained and are frequently not road-worthy.

Some notable events hosted by Cape Town have included the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]], [[2003 ICC Cricket World Cup]], and World Championships in various sports such as athletics, fencing, weightlifting, hockey, cycling, canoeing, gymnastics and others. Cape Town was also a host city to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] from 11 June to 11 July 2010, further enhancing its profile as a major events city. It was also one of the host cities of the [[2009 Indian Premier League]] cricket tournament. The Mother City has also played host to the [[South Africa Sevens|Africa leg]] of the annual [[World Rugby Sevens Series|World Rugby 7s]] event since 2015; for nine seasons, from 2002 until 2010, the event was staged in [[George, Western Cape|George]] in the Western Cape, before moving to [[Port Elizabeth]] for the [[2011 South Africa Sevens|2011 edition]], and then to Cape Town in 2015. The event usually takes place in mid-December, and is hosted at the [[Cape Town Stadium]] in Green Point.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Stadium |url=http://capetown7s.com/stadium/ |access-date=12 October 2020 |website=HSBC Cape Town Sevens |archive-date=25 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201125135018/https://capetown7s.com/stadium/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

There are several golf courses in Cape Town. The Clovelly Country Club and Metropolitan Golf Club have 18 holes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Best Golf Courses in Cape Town |url=https://moneytoday.co.za/best-golf-courses-in-cape-town/ |website=MoneyToday.co.za |date=9 July 2022 |publisher=MoneyToday |access-date=12 July 2022 |archive-date=9 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220709184621/https://moneytoday.co.za/best-golf-courses-in-cape-town/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The coastline of Cape Town is relatively long, and the varied exposure to weather conditions makes it fairly common for water conditions to be conducive to recreational scuba diving at some part of the city's coast. There is considerable variation in the underwater environment and regional ecology as there are dive sites on reefs and wrecks on both sides of the Cape Peninsula and False Bay, split between two coastal marine ecoregions by the Cape Peninsula, and also variable by depth zone.

[[File:Blue Wall of Sandy Bay.jpg|thumb|Surfing in [[Sandy Bay, Cape Town|Sandy Bay]]]]
False Bay is open to the south, and the prevailing open ocean swell arrives from the southwest, so the exposure varies considerably around the coastline. The inshore bathymetry near Cape Point is shallow enough for a moderate amount of refraction of long period swell, but deep enough to have less effect on short period swell, and acts as a filter to pass mainly the longer swell components to the Western shores, although they are significantly attenuated. The eastern shores get more of the open ocean spectrum, and this results in very different swell conditions between the two sides at any given time. The fetch is generally too short for southeasterly winds to produce good surf. There are more than 20 [[False Bay#Surfing|named breaks in False Bay]]. The north-wester can have a long fetch and can produce large waves, but they may also be associated with local wind and be very poorly sorted. The Atlantic coast is exposed to the full power of the South-westerly swell produced by the westerly winds of the southern ocean, often a long way away, so the swell has time to separate into similar wavelengths, and there are some world class big wave breaks among the named breaks of the Atlantic shore.<ref name="Wavescape 1" /><ref name="Wavescape 2" /><ref name="Wavescape 3" />

In the 1950s the city was part of four editions of the famous [[Algiers-Cape Town Rally]], during the pioneer years of trans-Africa rallying and motor exploration. The closing of the road to the newly founded [[Zaire]] caused the city to be dropped from the traject.<ref>[https://www.cockpitdz.com/en/post/the-saga-of-rallye-algiers-cape-town-1951-1961 The Saga of Rally Algiers - Cape Town (1951 - 1961)]</ref>
