'''Auckland''' ({{Lang-mi|Tāmaki Makaurau}}) is one of the 16 [[regions of New Zealand]], which takes its name from the eponymous [[urban areas of New Zealand|urban area]]. The region encompasses the [[Auckland|Auckland metropolitan area]], smaller towns, rural areas, and the islands of the [[Hauraki Gulf]]. Containing {{Decimals|{{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Auckland region|y}}|R}}/{{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|New Zealand|y}}|R}}*100|0}} percent of the nation's residents,{{NZ population data 2018||||y}} it has by far the largest population and economy of any region of New Zealand, but the second-smallest land area.

On 1 November 2010, the Auckland region became a [[unitary authority]] administered by the [[Auckland Council]], replacing the previous regional council and seven local councils. In the process, an area in its southeastern corner was transferred to the neighbouring [[Waikato]] region. Since then, the Auckland Council has introduced a system of local boards to divide the region for local government.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Council |first=Auckland |title=All local boards |url=http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/about-auckland-council/how-auckland-council-works/local-boards/all-local-boards/Pages/default.aspx |access-date=2024-06-09 |website=Auckland Council |language=en}}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[Image:auckland.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|250px|True-colour image of the region showing the [[Auckland]] urban area as the brownish area just left of centre, with the [[Hauraki Gulf]] to the right]]

On the mainland, the region extends from the mouth of the [[Kaipara Harbour]] in the north across the southern stretches of the [[Northland Peninsula]], through the [[Waitākere Ranges]] and the [[Auckland isthmus]] and across the low-lying land surrounding the [[Manukau Harbour]], ending within a few kilometres of the mouth of the [[Waikato River]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Auckland region - Landforms |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/auckland-region/page-3 |access-date=1 June 2019 |date=6 December 2007 |language=en |last1=McClure |first1=Margaret}}</ref> It also includes the islands of the [[Hauraki Gulf]]. It is bordered in the north by the [[Northland Region]], and in the south by the [[Waikato]] region. The [[Hunua Ranges]] and the adjacent coastline along the Firth of Thames were part of the region until the Auckland Council was formed in late 2010, when they were transferred to the Waikato region. In land area the region is smaller than all the other regions and [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]] except [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]].

The region's coastline is {{convert|3702|km|mi}} long.<ref name="DRAFTLTP2012Page12">{{Cite book |last=Auckland Council |title=Draft Long-term Plan 2012–2022 |year=2012 |page=13}}</ref> It has about {{convert|21000|km|mi}} of rivers and streams, about 8&nbsp;percent of these in urban areas.<ref name=DRAFTLTP2012Page12/> Its highest point is the summit of [[Little Barrier Island]], at 722 metres.

=== Past administrative divisions ===
Prior to the merger into the [[Auckland Council]] on 1 November 2010, the Auckland Region consisted of seven [[Territorial authorities of New Zealand|territorial local authorities]] (TLAs); four cities and three districts:

* [[Auckland City]]
* [[Manukau City]]
* [[North Shore City]]
* [[Waitakere City]]
* [[Franklin District]]
* [[Papakura District]]
* [[Rodney District]]
