'''Cartagena''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɑːr|t|ə|ˈ|h|eɪ|n|ə}} {{respell|KAR|tə|HAY|nə}}), known since the colonial era as '''Cartagena de Indias''' ({{IPA|es|kaɾtaˈxena ðe ˈindjas|lang|Es-Cartagena de Indias.oga}}), is a [[city]] and one of the major [[port]]s on the northern coast of [[Colombia]] in the [[Caribbean Region of Colombia|Caribbean Coast Region]], along the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean sea]].  Cartagena's past role as a link in the route to the West Indies provides it with important historical value for world exploration and preservation of heritage from the great commercial maritime routes.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Centre |first1=UNESCO World Heritage |title=Port, Fortresses and Group of Monuments, Cartagena |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/285/ |website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |language=en}}</ref> As a former Spanish colony, it was a key port for the export of Bolivian silver to Spain and for the [[Slavery in Cartagena|import of enslaved Africans]] under the [[asiento]] system. It was defensible against [[Piracy in the Caribbean|pirate]] attacks in the Caribbean.<ref>Lance R. Grahn, "Cartagena" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 1, p 581. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.</ref> The city's strategic location between the [[Magdalena River|Magdalena]] and [[Sinú River|Sinú]] rivers also gave it easy access to the interior of [[New Kingdom of Granada|New Granada]] and made it a main port for trade between Spain and its overseas empire, establishing its importance by the early 1540s.

Modern Cartagena is the capital of the [[Bolívar Department]], and had a population of 876,885 according to the 2018 census,<ref>[http://www.citypopulation.de/en/colombia/bolivar/cartagena_de_indias/13001000__cartagena_de_indias/ Citypopulation.de]</ref> making it the second-largest city in the [[Caribbean region of Colombia|Caribbean region]], after [[Barranquilla]], and the [[List of cities in Colombia|fifth-largest]] city in Colombia. The [[metropolitan area]] of Cartagena is the sixth-largest urban area in the country, after [[metropolitan area]] of [[Bucaramanga]]. Economic activities include the [[maritime industry|maritime]] and [[petrochemical]] industries, as well as tourism.

The present city{{em dash}}named after [[Cartagena, Spain]] and by extension, the historic city of [[Carthage]]{{em dash}}was founded on 1 June 1533, making it one of South America’s oldest colonial cities;<ref>{{cite news |title=Big on Charm: Colonial Cartagena |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/big-on-charm-colonial-cartagena |work=Travel |date=17 November 2015 |language=en}}</ref> but settlement by various indigenous people in the region around Cartagena Bay dates from 4000 BC. During the Spanish colonial period Cartagena had a key role in administration and expansion of the [[Spanish empire]]. It was a center of political, ecclesiastical, and economic activity.<ref>Grahn, "Cartagena" p. 582.</ref> In 1984, Cartagena's colonial walled city and fortress were designated a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].

It was also the site of the [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias]] in 1741 during the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] between [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]].

The [[Puerto Hormiga Culture]], founded in the Arjona Municipality of the Bolívar Department in the Caribbean coast region, particularly in the area from the [[Sinú River]] Delta to the Cartagena Bay, appears to be the first documented human community in what is now Colombia.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Arqueología y Patrimonio |url=https://revistas.icanh.gov.co/index.php/ap/article/download/2623/2020}}</ref> [[Archaeologists|Archeologists]] estimate that around 4000 BC, the formative culture was located near the boundary between the current departments of [[Bolívar Department|Bolívar]] and [[Sucre Department|Sucre]]. In this area, archeologists have found the most ancient ceramic objects of the Americas, dating from around 4000 BC. The primary reason for the proliferation of primitive societies in this area is thought to have been the relatively mild climate and the abundance of wildlife, which allowed the hunting inhabitants a comfortable life.<ref name="Biblioteca Luis Ángel Arango">{{cite web |url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/arqueologia/arqueolo/cap4.1.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923164704/http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/arqueologia/arqueolo/cap4.1.htm |archive-date=23 September 2006 |title=Biblioteca Luis Ángel Arango |publisher=Lablaa.org |access-date=26 March 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://pwp.supercabletv.net.co/garcru/colombia/Colombia/indios.html |title=Colombia Pais Maravilloso |publisher=Pwp.supercabletv.net.co |access-date=24 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425081104/http://pwp.supercabletv.net.co/garcru/colombia/Colombia/indios.html |archive-date=25 April 2013 }}</ref><ref name="uninorte.edu.co">{{cite web |url=http://www.uninorte.edu.co/divisiones/humanidades/arqueologia/proyectos/pro_pag_13-06.html |title=Universidad del Norte |publisher=Uninorte.edu.co |access-date=24 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220195301/http://uninorte.edu.co/divisiones/Humanidades/arqueologia/proyectos/pro_pag_13-06.html |archive-date=20 December 2010 }}</ref>

Archeological investigations date the decline of the Puerto Hormiga culture and its related settlements to be ~3000 BC. The rise of a much more developed culture, the Monsú, who lived at the end of the [[Canal del Dique|Dique Canal]] near today's Cartagena neighborhoods Pasacaballos and Ciénaga Honda at the northernmost part of Barú Island, has been hypothesized. The Monsú culture appears to have inherited the Puerto Hormiga culture's use of the art of pottery and also to have developed a mixed economy of agriculture and basic manufacture. The Monsú people's diet was based mostly on shellfish and fresh and salt-water fish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/publicacionesbanrep/boletin/boleti3/bol12/debate.htm |title=Biblioteca Luis Ángel Arango |publisher=Lablaa.org |date=4 June 2005 |access-date=24 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201091431/http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/publicacionesbanrep/boletin/boleti3/bol12/debate.htm |archive-date=1 December 2008 }}</ref>

The development of the Sinú society in what is today the departments of Córdoba and Sucre, eclipsed these first developments around the Cartagena Bay area. Until the [[Spanish colonization]], many cultures derived from the [[Kalina people|Karib]], [[Malibu languages|Malibu]] and [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]] [[language families]] lived along the Colombian Caribbean coast. In the late pre-Columbian era, the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] was home to the [[Tayrona]] people, whose language was closely related to the [[Chibcha]] language family.<ref>"X Cátedra de Historia Ernesto Restrepo Tirado – El Caribe en la Nación Colombiana" Guerra, Langbaek et al.

Around AD 1500, the area was inhabited by different tribes of the [[Carib language]] family, more precisely the Mocanae sub-family.

Mocana villages of the [[Kalina people|Carib people]] around the Bay of Cartagena included:<ref name="Lemaitre">{{cite book|last1=Lemaitre|first1=Eduardo|title=A Brief History of Cartagena|date=1994|publisher=Compania Litografica Nacional S.A.|location=Medellin|isbn=978-958-638-092-8|page=13}}</ref>

Heredia found these settlements "...largely surrounded with the heads of dead men placed on stakes."<ref name=Parry/>{{rp|481}}

Some subsidiary tribes of the Kalamari lived in today's neighborhood of Pie de la Popa, and other subsidiaries from the Cospique lived in the [[Membrillal]] and [[Pasacaballos]] areas. Among these, according to the earliest documents available, the [[Calamari people|Kalamari]] had preeminence. These tribes, though physically and administratively separated, shared a common architecture, such as hut structures consisting of circular rooms with tall roofs, which were surrounded by defensive wooden palisades.<ref>[[Eduardo Lemaitre|Lemaitre, Eduardo]]; ''Historia Extensa de Cartagena de Indias,'' Ed.

[[Rodrigo de Bastidas]] traveled to the Pearl Coast and the Gulf of Uraba in 1500–01. On 14 February 1504, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand V]] contracted [[Juan de la Cosa]]'s voyage to Uraba. However, Juan de la Cosa died in 1510 along with 300 of Alonso de Ojeda's men, after an armed confrontation with indigenous people, and before Juan de la Cosa could get possession of the [[Gulf of Urabá]] area. Similar contracts were signed in 1508 with Diego de Nicuesa for the settlement of [[Veragua]] and with Alonso de Ojeda for the settlement of Uraba, "where gold had already been obtained on earlier voyages," according to Floyd.<ref name="Floyd">{{cite book|last1=Floyd|first1=Troy|title=The Columbus Dynasty in the Caribbean, 1492–1526|date=1973|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|pages=49, 89, 95, 135}}</ref><ref name=Parry>{{cite book|last1=Parry|first1=John|last2=Keith|first2=Robert|title=New Iberian World: A Documentary History of the Discovery and Settlement of Latin America to the Early 17th Century, Vol. II|date=1984|publisher=Times Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8129-1070-4|page=454}}</ref>

After the failed effort to found [[Antigua del Darién]] in 1506 by [[Alonso de Ojeda]] and the subsequent unsuccessful founding of [[San Sebastián de Urabá]] in 1510 by [[Diego de Nicuesa]], the southern Caribbean coast became unattractive to colonizers. They preferred the better known [[Hispaniola]] and [[Cuba]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bruceruiz.net/PanamaHistory/diego_de_nicuesa.htm |title=Diego de Nicuesa |publisher=Bruceruiz.net |date=22 April 2002 |access-date=24 June 2010}}</ref>

Although the royal control point for trade, the [[Casa de Contratación]] gave permission to [[Rodrigo de Bastidas]] (1460–1527) to again conduct an expedition as [[adelantado]] to this area, Bastidas explored the coast and sighted the [[Magdalena River]] Delta in his first journey from [[Department of La Guajira|Guajira]] to the south in 1527, a trip that ended in the [[Gulf of Urabá]], the location of the failed first settlements. De Nicuesa and De Ojeda noted the existence of a big bay on the way from [[Santo Domingo]] to [[Gulf of Urabá|Urabá]] and the [[Panama isthmus]], and that encouraged Bastidas to investigate.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Related Articles |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/55612/Rodrigo-de-Bastidas |title=Rodrigo de Bastidas (Colombian explorer) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |access-date=24 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bruceruiz.net/PanamaHistory/rodrigo_de_bastidas.htm |title=Rodrigo de Bastidas |publisher=Bruceruiz.net |date=3 July 2002 |access-date=24 June 2010}}</ref><ref>Lemaitre, Eduardo; Historia Extensa de Cartagena de Indias, Ed.

Under contract to Queen [[Joanna of Castile]], [[Pedro de Heredia]] entered the Bay of Cartagena with three ships, a [[lighter (barge)|lighter]], 150 men, and 22 horses, on 14 January 1533. He soon found the village of Calamari abandoned. Proceeding onwards to Turbaco, where Juan de la Cosa had been mortally wounded 13 years earlier, Heredia fought an all-day battle before claiming victory. Using [[India Catalina]] as a guide, Heredia embarked on a three-month exploration expedition. He returned to Calamari in April 1533 with gold pieces, including a solid gold porcupine weighing 132 pounds. In later expeditions, Heredia raided the [[Zenú|Sinú]] tombs and temples of gold. His rule as governor of Cartagena lasted 22 years, before perishing on his return to Spain in 1544.<ref name=Lemaitre/>{{rp|14–17}}<ref name=Parry/>{{rp|479–85}}

Cartagena was founded on 1 June 1533 by the Spanish commander, [[Pedro de Heredia]], in the former location of the indigenous Caribbean [[Calamarí]] village. The town was named after the port city of [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]], in [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] in southeast Spain, where most of Heredia's sailors had resided.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/marzo1992/marzo3.htm |title=Biblioteca Luis Ángel Arango |publisher=Lablaa.org |date=1 June 2005 |access-date=24 June 2010 |archive-date=19 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019045321/http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/marzo1992/marzo3.htm }}</ref> King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] gave Cartagena the title of "city" (''ciudad'') in 1574, adding "most noble and loyal" in 1575.<ref name=Lemaitre/>{{rp|23}}

The city's increasing importance as a port for the export of Bolivian silver from [[Potosí]] to Spain, made it an obvious target for pirates and [[French corsairs|corsairs]], encouraged by France, England, and Holland. In 1544, the city was pillaged by 5 ships and 1,000 men under the command of the French pirate [[Jean-François Roberval]], who took advantage of the city still without walls. Heredia was forced to retreat to Turbaco until a ransom was paid. A defensive tower, ''San Felipe del Boqueron'', was built in 1566 by Governor Anton Davalos. It was supposed to protect the anchorage and the Bahia de las Animas, a water lane into Plaza de lar Mar (current day Plaze de la Aduana), but the fort's battery had limited range. Then the French pirate Martin Cote struck in 1569 with 1,000 men, ransacking the city.<ref name=Lemaitre/>{{rp|23–24}}<ref name=Segovia/>{{rp|97–98}}

A few months after the disaster of the invasion of Cote, a fire destroyed the city and forced the creation of a firefighting squad, the first in the Americas.<ref>De Castellanos, Juan; ''Historia de Cartagena'', Bogotá: Biblioteca de Cultura Popular de Colombia, 1942.{{page needed|date=January 2016}}</ref>{{full citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In 1568, Sir [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] tried to persuade Governor [[Martín de las Alas]] to open a trade fair in the city which would allow his men to sell foreign goods. This was a violation of Spanish law, which forbade trade with foreigners. Many in the settlement suspected this would have allowed Hawkins to sack the port afterwards; and as such the governor declined.

In 1610, the [[Spanish Inquisition|Holy Office of the Inquisition]] was established in Cartagena and The [[Palace of Inquisition]] was completed in 1770. Sentences were pronounced in the main city plaza, today's Plaza de Bolivar, during the ''Autos de Fe'' ceremonies. Crimes under its jurisdiction included those of [[heresy]], [[blasphemy]], [[bigamy]] and [[witchcraft]]. A total of 767 people were punished, which ranged from fines, wearing a [[Sanbenito]], life imprisonment, or even the death of five. The Inquisition was abolished with independence in 1811.<ref name=Lemaitre/>{{rp|28}}

The first slaves were brought by [[Pedro de Heredia]] to work as "macheteros", clearing the underbrush. By the 17th century, Cartagena had become an important slave market in the [[New World]], centered around the Plaza de los Coches. European slave traders began to bring [[Atlantic slave trade|enslaved peoples]] from Africa during this period. Spain was the only European power that did not establish [[Factory (trading post)|factories]] in Africa to purchase slaves and therefore the Spanish Empire relied on the [[asiento]] system, awarding merchants from other European nations the license to trade enslaved people to their overseas territories.<ref>{{cite book|title= Génesis y desarrollo de la esclavitud en Colombia siglos XVI y XVII|publisher= Universidad del Valle|isbn = 978-958-670-338-3|year= 2005|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PH_cf27ucZAC&pg=PP1|language = es}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title= Los místeres de las minas: crónica de la colonia europea más grande de Colombia en el siglo XIX, surgida alrededor de las minas de Marmato, Supía y Riosucio|author= Alvaro Gärtner|publisher= Universidad de Caldas|isbn = 978-958-8231-42-6|year= 2005|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5cUdM30KwxkC&pg=PP1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gabrielbernat.es/espana/esclavitud/index.html|title= La esclavitud negra en la América española |publisher= gabrielbernat.es|year = 2003|language = es}}</ref><ref name=Lemaitre/>{{rp|30}}<ref name=Segovia/>{{rp|135}}

Gov. [[Francisco de Murga]] made the Inner Bay an "impregnable lagoon", according to Segovia, which included the forts ''El Boquerón'', ''Castillo Grande'', ''Manzanillo'', and ''Manga''. Besides the walls built to defend the historic district of Calamari, Francisco de Murga enclosed Getsemani with protective walls starting in 1631. This included the [[artillery battery|battery]] of Media Luna of San Antonio, located between the [[bastion]]s of Santa Teresa and Santa Barbara, which protected the only gate and [[causeway]] to the mainland.<ref name=Segovia/>{{rp|98, 130}}

The practice of ''[[Situado]]'' is exemplified in the magnitude of the city's subsidy between 1751 and 1810, when the city received the sum of 20,912,677 [[Spanish real]]es.<ref name="Meisel Roca 2002" /><ref name="Kraus2010" />{{page needed|date=January 2016}}

The [[Raid on Cartagena (1697)|Raid on Cartagena]], in April 1697 during the [[Nine Years' War]], by Sir [[Bernard Desjean, Baron de Pointis]] and [[Jean Baptiste Ducasse]] was a severe blow to Cartagena. The Baron's forces included 22 large ships, 500 cannon, and 4,000 troops, while Ducasse's forces consisted of 7 ships and 1,200 [[buccaneers]]. They quickly overwhelmed [[Sancho Jimeno de Orozco]]'s force of 30 men in the ''San Luis de Bocachica'' fortification. Then, ''San Felipe de Barajas'' also fell and the city came under bombardment. When the Half Moon Gate was breached and Getsemani island occupied, Governor Diego de los Rios capitulated. The Baron left after a month of plunder (roughly 2 million livres) and Ducasse followed a week later.<ref name=Lemaitre/>{{rp|31–32}}

When King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] employed the Italian engineer Juan Bautista Antonelli to design a master plan of fortifications for Cartagena, construction would actually continue for the next two hundred years. On 17 March 1640, three Portuguese ships under the command of Rodrigo Lobo da Silva, ran aground in the Bocagrande Channel. This accelerated the formation of a [[sand bar]], which soon connected the Bocagrande Peninsula to the island of Tierrabomba. The defense of the bay then shifted to two forts on either side of Bocachica, ''San Jose'' and ''[[Castle of San Luis de Bocachica|San Luis de Bocachica]]''. ''San Luis'' was replaced by ''San Fernando'' after the 1741 English raid. The next narrow passage was formed by the Island of Manzanillo, where ''San Juan del Manzanillo'' was constructed and ''Santa Cruz O Castillo Grande'' opposite on Cruz Grande at Punta Judio, both connected by a floating chain. Finally, there was ''San Felipe del Boquerón'', later ''San Sebastián del Pastelillo''. The city itself was circled with a ring of [[bastion]]s connected by [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtains]]. The island of Getsemani was also fortified. Protecting the city on the landward side, atop San Lázaro hill, was the [[Castillo San Felipe de Barajas]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Castillo San Felipe de Barajas |url=http://www.incartagenaguide.com/incartagena/castillo-san-felipe-de-barajas/ |website=Incartagenaguide.com |access-date=9 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409090318/http://www.incartagenaguide.com/incartagena/castillo-san-felipe-de-barajas/ |archive-date=9 April 2016 }}</ref> named in honor of Spain's King [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] and Governor [[Pedro Zapata de Mendoza, Marquis of Barajas]]' father, the Count of Barajas.

===Viceregal era: 1717–1811===
The 18th century began poorly for the city economically, as the [[Bourbon dynasty]] discontinued the ''Carrera de Indias'' convoys. However, with the establishment of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] and the constant Anglo-Spanish conflicts, Cartagena took on the stronghold as the "gateway to the Indies of Peru". By 1777, the city included 13,700 inhabitants with a garrison of 1300. The population reached 17,600 in 1809.<ref name=Segovia/>{{rp|31–33, 36}}

In 1731, Juan de Herrera y Sotomayor founded the Military Academy of Mathematics and Practice of Fortifications in Cartagena. He is also known for designing the [[Puerta del Reloj, Cartagena|Puerta del Reloj]] starting in 1704.<ref name=Segovia/>{{rp|43, 138–39}}

Starting in mid-April 1741, the city endured a siege by a large [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] armada under the command of Admiral [[Edward Vernon]]. The engagement, known as [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias]], was part of the larger [[War of Jenkins' Ear]]. The British armada included 50 warships, 130 transport ships, and 25,600 men, including 2,000 North American colonial infantry. The Spanish defense was under the command of [[Sebastián de Eslava]] and Don [[Blas de Lezo]]. The British were able to take the Castillo de San Luis at Bocachica and land marines on the island of Tierrabomba and Manzanillo. The North Americans then took La Popa hill.<ref name=Lemaitre/>{{rp|33–35}}

Following a failed attack on San Felipe Barajas on 20 April 1741, which left 800 British dead and another 1,000 taken prisoner, Vernon lifted the siege. By that time he had many sick men from tropical diseases. An interesting footnote to the battle was the inclusion of [[George Washington]]'s half brother, [[Lawrence Washington (1718–1752)|Lawrence Washington]], among the North American colonial troops. Lawrence later named his [[Mount Vernon]] estate in honor of his commander.<ref name=Lemaitre/>{{rp|35–36}}

In 1762, Antonio de Arebalo published his Defense Plan, the Report on the estate of defense on the avenues of Cartagena de Indias. This engineer continued the work to make Cartagena impregnable, including the construction from 1771 to 1778, of a 3400 yards long underwater [[jetty]] across the Bocagrande called the ''Escollera''. Arebalo had earlier completed ''San Fernando'', and the fort-battery of ''San Jose'' in 1759, then added ''El Angel San Rafael'' on El Horno hill as added protection across the Bocachica.<ref name=Segovia/>{{rp|55, 81–94}}

Among the censuses of the 18th century was the special census of 1778, imposed by the governor of the time, D. [[Juan de Torrezar Diaz Pimienta]] – later [[Viceroy of New Granada]] – by order of the [[Marquis of Ensenada]], Minister of Finance – so that he would be provided numbers for his [[Catastro]] tax project, which imposed a universal property tax he believed would contribute to the economy while at the same time increasing royal revenues dramatically. The census of 1778, besides having significance for economic history, required each house to be described in detail and its occupants enumerated, making the census an important tool<ref>This is used today by restoration architects in Cartagena's city center. The original census is preserved in the Museum of History of the city while a copy rests in the [[Archivo de Indias]] in [[Seville]]</ref> The census revealed what Ensenada had hoped.

For more than 275 years, Cartagena was under Spanish rule. With [[Napoleon]]'s imprisonment of [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] and [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], and the start of the [[Peninsular War]], the [[Spanish American wars of independence|Latin American wars of independence]] soon followed. In Cartagena, on 4 June 1810, Royal Commissioner [[Antonio Villavicencio]] and the Cartagena City Council banished the Spanish Governor Francisco de Montes on suspicions of sympathy for the French emperor and the French occupation forces which overthrew the king. A Supreme Junta was formed, along with two political parties, one led by [[Jose Maria Garcia de Toledo]] representing the aristocrats, and a second led by Gabriel and German Piñeres representing the common people of Getsemani. Finally, on 11 November, a Declaration of Independence was signed proclaiming "a free state, sovereign and independent of all domination and servitude to any power on Earth".<ref name=Lemaitre/>{{rp|49–51}} The support for a declaration of independence by working class leader and artisan Pedro Romero was key in pushing the Junta to adopting it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cartagenaexplorer.com/biography-pedro-romero-cartagena-black-independence-leader/|title=Biography of Pedro Romero – Black, Working Class Hero of Cartagena's Independence|date=25 October 2018|website=Cartagena Explorer|access-date=13 January 2019}}</ref>

Spain's reaction was to send a "pacifying expedition" under the command of [[Pablo Morillo]], The Pacifier, and Pascual de Enrile, which included 59 ships, and 10,612 men. The city was [[Siege of Cartagena (1815)|placed under siege]] on 22 August 1815. The city was defended by 3000 men, 360 cannons, and 8 ships plus ancillary small watercraft, under the command of [[Manuel del Castillo y Rada]] and Juan N. Enslava. However, by that time, the city was under the rule of the Garcia de Toledo Party, having exiled German and Gabriel Piñeres, and [[Simon Bolivar]]. By 5 December, about 300 people per day died from hunger or disease, forcing 2000 to flee on vessels provided by the French mercenary Louis Aury. By that time, 6000 had died. Morillo, in retaliation after entering the city, shot nine of the rebel leaders on 24 February 1816, at what is now known as the Camellon de los Martires. These included [[José María García de Toledo]] and [[Manuel del Castillo y Rada]].<ref name=Lemaitre/>{{rp|55–60}}

Finally, a patriot army led by General [[Mariano Montilla]], supported by Admiral [[José Prudencio Padilla]], laid siege to the city from August 1820 until October 1821. A key engagement was the destruction of almost all of the royalist ships anchored on Getsemani Island on 24 June 1821. After Governor Gabriel Torres surrendered, Simon Bolivar the Liberator, bestowed the title "Heroic City" onto Cartagena. The Liberator spent 18 days in the city from 20 to 28 July 1827, staying in the Government Palace in Proclamation Square and the guest of a banquet hosted by Jose Padilla at his residence on Calle Larga.<ref name=Lemaitre/>{{rp|60, 67}}

Unfortunately, the toll of war, in particular from Morillo's siege long affected the city. With the loss of the funds it had received as the main colonial military outpost, and the loss of population, the city deteriorated. It suffered a long decline in the aftermath of independence, and was largely neglected by the central government in Bogotá. In fact, its population did not reach pre-1811 numbers until the start of the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cartagenaexplorer.com/consequences-of-cartagenas-independence/|title=Consequences of Cartagena's Independence|date=19 November 2018|website=Cartagena Explorer|access-date=13 January 2019}}</ref>

These declines were also due to disease, including a devastating cholera epidemic in 1849. The Canal del Dique that connected it to the Magdalena River also filled with silt, leading to a drastic reduction in the amount of international trade. The rise of the port of Barranquilla only compounded the decline in trade. During the presidency of Rafael Nuñez, who was a Cartagena native, the central government finally invested in a railroad and other infrastructure improvements and modernization that helped the city to recover.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cartagenaexplorer.com/history-of-cartagena-comprehensive/|title=History of Cartagena – A Comprehensive Guide to the History of Cartagena, Colombia|date=11 July 2018|website=Cartagena Explorer|access-date=13 January 2019}}</ref>

===Neighborhoods===

====Northern area====
In this area is the [[Rafael Núñez International Airport]], located in the neighborhood of Crespo, ten minutes' drive from downtown or the old part of the city and fifteen minutes away from the modern area. Zona Norte, the area located immediately north of the airport, contains hotels, the urban development office of Barcelona de Indias, and several educational institutions.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The old city walls, which enclose the ''centro'' or downtown area and the neighborhood of San Diego, are located to the southwest of Crespo. On the Caribbean shore between Crespo and the old city lie the neighborhoods of Marbella and [[El Cabrero]].

====Downtown====

The Downtown area of Cartagena has varied architecture, mainly a colonial style, but republican and Italian style buildings, such as the cathedral's bell tower, can be seen.

The main entrance to downtown is the ''[[Puerta del Reloj, Cartagena|Puerta del Reloj]]'' (Clock Gate), which exits onto the ''[[Plaza de los Coches]]'' (Square of the Carriages).<ref>{{cite web |title=La Torre del Reloj Testigo Silencioso de un pasado |trans-title=The Clock Tower: Silent Witness to the Past |url=http://www.traviatacartagena.com/es/marzo/arte.htm |website=Traviata Nuestra |language=es |access-date=10 October 2016}}</ref> A few steps farther is the ''Plaza de la Aduana'' (Customs Square), next to the mayor's office. Nearby is [[San Pedro Claver Square]] and the church also named for Saint [[Peter Claver]], where the body of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] saint ('Saint of the African slaves') is kept in a casket, as well as the Museum of Modern Art.{{refn|[[Peter Claver]] was a Spanish-born man who traveled to Cartagena in 1610.

After four years of sickness, Peter died in 1654. Two services were held for him: the official funeral, and a separate memorial attended by his African friends. In 1888, the Roman Catholic Church [[canonized]] Peter. He is now known as the patron saint of African-Americans, slaves and the Republic of Colombia.<ref>Proceso de beatificación y canonización de San Pedro Claver. Edición de 1696.

Nearby is the Plaza de Bolívar (Bolívar's Square) and the [[Palace of Inquisition]]. Plaza de Bolívar (formerly known as Plaza de La Inquisicion) is essentially a small park with a statue of [[Simón Bolívar]] in the center. This plaza is surrounded by balconied colonial buildings.  Shaded outdoor cafes line the street.

The Office of Historical Archives devoted to Cartagena's history is not far away. Next to the archives is the Government Palace, the office building of the Governor of the Department of Bolivar. Across from the palace is the [[Cathedral of Cartagena, Colombia|Cathedral of Cartagena]], which dates back to the 16th century.

Another religious building of significance is the Iglesia de Santo Domingo in front of Plaza Santo Domingo (Santo Domingo Square). In the square is the sculpture ''Mujer Reclinada'' ("Reclining Woman"), a gift from the notable Colombian artist [[Fernando Botero]]. Nearby is the [[Tcherassi Hotel]], a 250-year-old colonial mansion renovated by designer [[Silvia Tcherassi]].

In the city is the Augustinian Fathers Convent and the [[University of Cartagena]]. This university is a center of higher education opened to the public in the late 19th century. The ''Claustro de Santa Teresa'' (Saint Theresa Cloister), which has been remodeled and has become a hotel operated by Charleston Hotels. It has its own square, protected by the San Francisco Bastion.

A 20-minute walk from downtown is the [[Castillo de San Felipe de Barajas]], located in el Pie de la Popa (another neighborhood), one of the greatest fortresses built by the Spaniards in their colonies. The tunnels were all constructed in such a way as to make it possible to hear footsteps of an approaching enemy. Some of the tunnels are open for viewing today.

Cartagena's walled Old City is known in part for its lush plazas,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/travel/things-to-do-in-36-hours-in-cartagena-colombia.html |title=36 Hours in Cartagena, Colombia |work=The New York Times |date=10 September 2014 |last1=Moon |first1=Freda }}</ref> and sherbet-hued Spanish colonial buildings.<ref>{{cite web |title=AD's Guide to Cartagena, Colombia |url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/travel-guide-cartagena-colombia |website=Architectural Digest |date=16 March 2016}}</ref>

====San Diego====
San Diego was named after the local San Diego Convent, now known as the Beaux Arts University Building. In front of it is the Convent of the [[Poor Clares|Nuns of the Order of Saint Clare]], now the Hotel Santa Clara. In the surrounding area is Santo Toribio Church, the last church built in the Walled City. Next to it is Fernández de Madrid Square, honoring Cartagena's hero, José Fernández de Madrid, whose statue can be seen nearby.

Inside the Old City{{clarify|Since this is capitalized, it must be important and deserves more space than this. Mentioned in later paragraph as well|date=November 2012}} is found [[Las Bóvedas]] (The Vaults),<ref>{{cite web|title=Cartagena attractions: Las Bovedas|url=http://www.viator.com/Cartagena-attractions/Las-Bovedas/d4498-a6201|publisher=Viator|access-date=11 December 2013}}</ref> a construction attached to the walls of the Santa Catalina Fortress.

Once a district characterized by crime, Getsemaní, just south of the ancient walled fortress, has become "Cartagena's hippest neighborhood and one of Latin America's newest hotspots", with plazas that were once the scene of drug dealing being reclaimed and old buildings being turned into boutique hotels.<ref>{{cite news |last=Saladino |first=Emily |title=A renaissance beyond Cartagena's historic walls |url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20130724-a-renaissance-beyond-cartagenas-historic-walls |date=23 August 2013 |department=Travel |website=[[BBC]] |access-date=24 August 2016}}</ref>

Getsemaní has become a "Ciudad Mural" to rescue the values, customs, traditions and anecdotes of the people.[https://forbes.co/2020/01/03/forbes-life/getsemani-el-barrio-de-cartagena-entre-los-mas-cool-del-mundo]

====Bocagrande====
The Bocagrande (Big Mouth) is an area known for its [[skyscraper]]s. The area contains the bulk of the city's tourist facilities, such as hotels, shops, restaurants, nightclubs and art galleries. It is located between [[Cartagena Bay]] to the east and the Caribbean Sea to the west, and includes the two neighborhoods of El Laguito (The Little Lake) and Castillogrande (Big Castle). Bocagrande has long beaches and much commercial activity is found along Avenida San Martín (Saint Martin Avenue).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tripelle.com/medellin-vs-cartagena-vs-bogota-which-is-the-best-colombian-city-for-your-next-vacation/|title=Medellin vs. Cartagena vs. Bogota: Which is the Best Colombian City for Your Next Vacation?|date=23 March 2019|website=Tripelle|access-date=1 November 2019}}</ref>

The beaches of Bocagrande, lying along the northern shore, are made of volcanic sand, which is slightly grayish in color. This makes the water appear muddy, though it is not. There are breakwaters about every {{convert|200|yd|m|order=flip|sp=us}}.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

On the bay side of the peninsula of Bocagrande is a seawalk. In the center of the bay is a statue of the Virgin Mary. The Naval Base is also located in Bocagrande, looking at the Bay.

* [[Las Bóvedas]]

* Fortresses in Cartagena de Indias: Of the twenty fortresses comprising the walls in the district of Getsemaní, today 16 are still standing, preserved in good condition. In 1586, it was commissioned to the most famous military engineer of the Crown of Spain in that time, the Italian [[Battista Antonelli]], the fortification of the city. The works of the project finally ended in the 17th century. Cartagena became an impregnable bastion, which successfully resisted the attacks of Baron Pontis to 1697. In the 18th century, new additions gave the fortified complex its current amplitude by engineer {{ill|Antonio de Arévalo|es}}. The initial fortification system includes only the urban recint, the bastion port of San Matías at the entrance to the passage of Bocagrande, and the Tower of San Felipe del Boquerón that controlled the Bay of las Ánimas. Gradually, all passages were dominated by fortresses: fortress of San Luis, fortress of San José and fortress of San Fernando in Bocachica, fortress of San Rafaél and fortress of Santa Bárbara in Pochachica (the passage at southwest), fortress of Santa Cruz, fortress of San Juan de Manzanillo and fortress of San Sebasi de Pastellilo around the interior of Bahía, castle of San Felipe de Barajas, in the rock that dominates the city from the east and access to protected the Isthmus del Cerebro. The fortifications of San Felipe de Barajas in Cartagena, protected the city during numerous sieges, giving its character and reputation unassailable. These are described as a masterpiece of Spanish military engineering in the Americas.

The city has a budding hotel industry with small boutique hotels being primarily concentrated in the Walled City and larger hotels in the beach front neighborhood of Bocagrande.  The area of Getsemaní just outside the wall is also a popular place for small hotels and hostels.<ref>{{cite web |title=Where to Stay in Cartagena? – Insider's Guide (with recommendations, 2019 update) |url=https://www.cartagenaexplorer.com/where-to-stay-best-areas-to-stay-cartagena-colombia-guide/ |website=Cartagena Explorer |date=28 June 2019}}</ref>

Cartagena has problems of traffic congestion.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gonzalez-Urango |first1=Hannia |last2=Pira |first2=Michela Le |last3=Inturri |first3=Giuseppe |last4=Ignaccolo |first4=Matteo |last5=García-Melón |first5=Mónica |title=Designing walkable streets in congested touristic cities: the case of Cartagena de Indias, Colombia |journal=Transportation Research Procedia |date=2020 |volume=45 |pages=309–316 |doi=10.1016/j.trpro.2020.03.021|hdl=20.500.12442/5225 |hdl-access=free }}</ref>

====Roads====
The city is linked to the northern part of the Caribbean Region through [[Highways in Colombia#50px Caribbean Transverse - National Route 90|roads 90]] and 90A, more commonly called Central Caribbean Road. This road passes through [[Barranquilla]], [[Santa Marta]] and [[Riohacha]] ending in [[Paraguachón]], Venezuela and continues with Venezuelan numeration all the way to [[Caracas]].  Taxis in the city perimeter do not have fare meters.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-08-08|title=Getting Around Cartagena - A Comprehensive Guide to Transportation in Cartagena, Colombia|url=https://www.cartagenaexplorer.com/comprehensive-guide-to-public-transportation-in-cartagena-colombia/|access-date=2021-05-28|website=Cartagena Explorer|language=en-US}}</ref>

Road 25: Going through [[Turbaco]] and [[Arjona, Colombia|Arjona]], and through the Montes de María when a fork divides it continuing to Sincelejo as National 25 and finally ending in [[Medellín]], and to the east to [[Valledupar]] as number 80.

Road 25 A: Going also to [[Sincelejo]], but avoiding the mountains, connects with Road 25 in the forementioned city.{{clarify|which is what? Medellín?|date=November 2012}}

====Air====
The [[Rafael Núñez International Airport]] is the busiest airport in Colombia's Caribbean region and the fourth in passenger traffic in the country. The code of the airport is CTG, having flights to almost all airports in Colombia including Bogota's [[El Dorado International Airport]]. Excessive operational costs and easier connection travel and better prices had led to the shifting of the Rafael Núñez's international connection passengers away from Bogota to the nearer [[Tocumen International Airport]] in Panama and [[Queen Beatrix International Airport]] in [[Aruba]]. Also, more companies prefer to serve the Colombian market from Cartagena, due to better geographical and atmospheric conditions.<ref>{{cite news|title=En Marzo Entregan Obras en el Aeropuerto|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.co/cartagena/economica/en-marzo-entregan-obras-en-el-aeropuerto-103770|access-date=20 February 2013|newspaper=El Universal}}</ref>

====Canals====
Since the 17th century the bay has been connected to the [[Magdalena River]] by the [[Canal del Dique|Dique Canal]], built by Governor Pedro Zapata de Mendoza. After Colombian independence, the canal was abandoned. Increasing [[centralization]] left the city without resources to maintain it. The last important maintenance work was done in the 1950s during [[Laureano Gómez]]'s administration. Some improvements were made by local authorities in the 1980s. This was discontinued because of legal objections from the central government that decreed that the "maintenance" of the canal did not fall under the [[jurisdiction]] of the local government. From then on, maintenance of the canal has been delayed, though it is still functional.<ref>Lemaitre, Eduardo; Historia Extensa de Cartagena de Indias, Ed. Aguilar 1976</ref>

Cartagenian political leaders have argued that this state of affairs might change with a return to pre-independence funding and tax system. Under such systems the canal would be maintained properly and even expanded, benefiting the national economy.<ref>"El Porvenir", Year CXVII, Issue 29.399, p. 4, column 2. Cartagena de Indias, 1999.</ref>

The port, the fortresses and the group of monuments of Cartagena were selected in 1984 by the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] ([[UNESCO]]) as significant to the heritage of the world, having the most extensive fortifications in South America. They are significant, too, for being located in a bay that is part of the Caribbean Sea. A system of zones divides the city into three neighborhoods: San Sebastian and Santa Catalina with the cathedral and many palaces where the wealthy lived and the main government buildings functioned; San Diego or Santo Toribio, where merchants and the middle class lived; and Getsemani, the suburban popular quarters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&id_site=285|title=Port, Fortresses and Group of Monuments, Cartagena|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|access-date=19 February 2015}}</ref>
