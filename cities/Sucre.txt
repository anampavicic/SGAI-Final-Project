'''Sucre''' ({{IPA|es|ˈsukɾe|lang}}) is the ''de jure'' [[capital city]] of [[Bolivia]], the capital of the [[Chuquisaca Department]] and the [[List of cities in Bolivia|sixth most populous city]] in Bolivia. Located in the south-central part of the country, Sucre lies at an elevation of {{cvt|2790|m}}. This relatively high altitude gives the city a [[subtropical highland climate]] with cool temperatures year-round. Over the centuries, the city has received various names, including La Plata, Charcas, and Chuquisaca.

Today, the region is of predominantly [[Quechua people|Quechua]] background, with some [[Aymara people|Aymara]] communities and influences.

Sucre holds major national importance and is an educational and government center, as well as the location of the [[Supreme Tribunal of Justice of Bolivia|Bolivian Supreme Court]]. Its pleasant climate and low crime rates{{citation_needed|date=July 2024}} have made the city popular amongst foreigners and Bolivians alike.{{citation_needed|date=July 2024}} Notably, Sucre contains one of the best preserved Hispanic colonial and republican historic city centres in the Western Hemisphere - similar to cities such as [[Cuzco]] and [[Quito]]. This architectural heritage and the millenarian history of the Charcas region has led to Sucre's designation as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The city has held an important place in Bolivian history from its place as an important center in the Real Audencia de Charcas, and later as the first capital of Bolivia before the fall of silver's importance as a global mineral commodity. Some regional tension remains from the historical transfer of capital functions to [[La Paz]], and even today the issue features an important role in local culture and political ideology.

==History==
Prior to Spanish colonization, Sucre was an Inca town called Chuquisaca,<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Platt |first=Tristán |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=owi2A3sh_nMC&pg=PA844 |title=Qaraqara-Charka: mallku, inka y rey en la provincia de Charcas (siglos XV-XVII) : historia antropológica de una confederación aymara |date=2006 |publisher=Plural editores |isbn=978-99954-1-367-5 |language=es |quote=Y luego desde el dicho pueblo de Auquimarca fue el dicho Hernando Pizarro y los demás capitanes y soldados de Vuestra Majestad, juntamente con el Inca Paullo, hacia Chuquisaca, a donde es ahora la ciudad de La Plata. [...] Y asímismo les honró a los demás caciques de toda esta provincia de los Charcas, por ser los primeros que habían venido a la obediencia de Vuestra Majestad los naturales de los Charcas.}}</ref> a name that remains an alternative designation for the city today. The name ''Chuquisaca'' possibly derives from the Quechua words ''chuqi'', meaning 'precious metal' or 'silver', and ''shaqa'' or ''saqa'', meaning 'abundance', 'a heap', or 'a pile of small things',<ref>{{Cite book |last=Romero |first=Francisco Carranza |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nmOoEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA216 |title=Diccionario Quechua Ancashino - Castellano |date=2024-08-09 |publisher=BOD GmbH DE |isbn=978-84-8489-098-0 |language=es |quote=shaqa 1. s.: montón de cosas pequeñas (granos, piojos), cascajo. 2. adj.: amontonado, montón de, cascajoso, shaqa maki: mano con muchas verrugas, shaqa rumi: montón de piedras chicas, cascajo, shaqa naani: camino cascajoso}}</ref> thus translating to 'a heap of precious metal' or 'a pile of silver'.

Chuquisaca was the provincial capital of the wamani of Charca, established after [[Topa Inca Yupanqui|Topa Inka Yupanqui]] conquered the [[Aymara kingdoms|Aymara kingdom]] that originally occupied the area and imposed the Quechua language on them.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ellefsen |first=Bernardo |date=1978 |title=La dominación Incaica en Cochabamba |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/bifea_0303-7495_1978_num_7_1_1500 |journal=Bulletin de l'Institut Français d'Études Andines |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=73–86 |doi=10.3406/bifea.1978.1500}}</ref> According to [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]], the Inca ruler received ambassadors from the kingdom of Tucman ([[Tucumán Province|Tucumán]]) while in Charca.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Berberián |first1=Eduardo E. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YPBrAAAAMAAJ |title=Culturas indígenas de los Andes Meridionales |last2=Raffino |first2=Rodolfo A. |date=1991 |publisher=Alhambra |isbn=978-84-205-2049-0 |language=es |quote=Estando el Inca en la Provincia de Charca, vinieron Embaxadores del reino llamado Tucman, que los Españoles llaman Tucumán, que está docientas leguas de los Charcas, al sueste...}}</ref> Due to their warrior background, the Charcas were excluded from various state duties and many served as soldiers,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tras la huella del Inka en Chile - Memoria Chilena |url=https://www.memoriachilena.gob.cl/602/w3-article-9889.html |access-date=2024-08-19 |website=Memoria Chilena: Portal |language=es |quote=Un segundo paso fue privilegiar a un grupo sometido como los Charca, una sociedad aymara parlante que recibió el honor de ser excluida de todos sus trabajos y deberes con el Estado para servir como soldados del Inka.}}</ref> being recruited in large numbers by [[Wayna Qhapaq]] for northern campaigns. During Wayna Qhapaq's wars in modern-day [[Ecuador]], the Guarani-speaking [[Ava Guaraní people|Chiriguanos]] from [[Paraguay]] invaded the Charcas frontier, aided by a band of European explorers. Although the Chiriguanos were repelled by commanders sent by Wayna Qhapaq from [[Quito]],<ref>{{Cite book |last=Saignes |first=Thierry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mmNSUqLxZu4C&pg=PA50 |title=Historia del pueblo Chiriguano |date=2007 |publisher=Plural editores |isbn=978-99954-1-067-4 |language=es |quote=En todo caso, Huayna Capac, muy preocupado, envió desde Quito a su mejor capitán, Yasca, quien volvió al Cuzco con un ejército...}}</ref> the Portuguese conquistador [[Aleixo Garcia]] is believed to be the first European to make contact with Charcas in 1525.

Although the Inca territories south of Cusco were assigned to the head conquistador [[Diego de Almagro]], there is no record of him visiting Chuquisaca and the [[Charca people|Charcas territory]] during his 1535 expedition to [[Collasuyo]]. After Almagro's murder in 1538, [[Francisco Pizarro]], sent his brothers [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] and [[Hernando Pizarro]] to Charcas to claim the region. Hernando Pizarro traveled to Chuquisaca along with the Emperor [[Paullu Inca]]. During their visit, they met with Consara, the principal lord of the Charcas region. Consara provided crucial information about the resources of Charca, including silver mines in Porco, gold mines in Chiutamarca, copper mines in Aytacara, and tin mines in Chayanta.<ref name=":1" /> The settlement was briefly occupied by Diego Méndez, under the orders of [[Diego de Almagro II]], during Almagro II's uprising against Pizarro and the Spanish government.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Baldivieso |first=Valentín Abecia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnIKAQAAIAAJ |title=...

The Spanish foundation of Sucre occurred on November 30, 1538, under the name ''Ciudad de la Plata de la Nueva Toledo'' (City of Silver of New Toledo) by [[Pedro Anzures]], Marqués de Campo Redondo. In 1559, the Spanish [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II]] established the ''[[Royal Audience of Charcas|Audiencia de Charcas]]'' in La Plata with authority over an area which covers what is now Paraguay, southeastern Peru, northern Chile and Argentina, and much of Bolivia. The ''[[Real Audiencia of Charcas]]'' was a subdivision of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] until 1776, when it was transferred to the newly created [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]]. In 1601 the Recoleta Monastery was founded by the Franciscans. In 1609, an [[archbishopric]] was founded in the city. In 1624 [[St Francis Xavier University of Chuquisaca]] was founded.

[[File:Chuquisaca city in 1615 by Guamán Poma.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Chuquisaca -as was its colonial name- in 1615 by the [[Inca]] painter [[Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala|Guamán Poma]] in his work "Nueva corónica y buen gobierno".

Very much a Spanish city during the colonial era, the narrow streets of the city centre are organised in a grid, reflecting the Andalusian culture that is embodied in the architecture of the city's great houses and numerous convents and churches. Sucre remains the seat of the Roman Catholic Church in Bolivia, and a common sight is members of religious orders dressed in traditional habit. For much of its colonial history, Sucre's temperate climate was preferred by the Spanish royalty and wealthy families involved in silver trade coming from [[Potosí]]. Sucre's University ([[University of Saint Francis Xavier|Universidad Mayor Real y Pontificia de San Francisco Xavier de Chuquisaca]]) is one of the oldest universities in the new world.

On May 25, 1809, the Bolivian independence movement was started with the ringing of the bell of the Basilica of Saint Francisco. This bell was rung to the point of breakage, but it can still be found in the Basilica today: it is one of the most precious relics of the city.
Until the 19th century, La Plata was the judicial, religious and cultural centre of the region. It was proclaimed provisional capital of the newly independent [[Upper Peru]] (later, Bolivia) in July 1826.<ref name=DicGeo>{{Cite book |publisher=Impr. "Bolívar" de M.

Many {{who|date=October 2011}} argue Sucre was the location of the beginning of the Latin American independence movement against Spain. From that point of view, Bolivia was the last Spanish imperial territory in South America to gain its independence, in 1825. In 1991, Sucre became a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

==Government==
Together with [[La Paz]], Sucre is one of two governmental centers of Bolivia: It is the seat of the judiciary, where the [[Supreme Court of Justice (Bolivia)|Supreme Court of Justice]] is located. As designated in the [[Constitution of Bolivia]], Sucre is the true capital of the nation, while La Paz is the seat of government. Sucre is also the [[capital city]] of the [[Departments of Bolivia|department]] of [[Chuquisaca department|Chuquisaca]]. The government of the City of Sucre is divided into [[executive (government)|executive]] and [[legislature|legislative]] branches. The [[Mayor of Sucre, Bolivia|Mayor of Sucre]] is the executive head of the city government, elected for a term of five years by general election. The legislative branch consists of the [[Municipal Council of Sucre, Bolivia|Municipal Council]], which elects a President, Vice President and Secretary from a group of eleven members.{{cn|date=January 2024}}

The mayor of Sucre is Enrique Leaño of the [[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement for Socialism]], who defeated Horacio Poppe in elections held on March 3, 2021.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |title=El MAS gana en Sucre y Enrique Leaño es el nuevo alcalde |url=https://www.opinion.com.bo/articulo/pais/mas-gana-sucre-enrique-leano-es-nuevo-alcalde/20210321235441812562.html |url-status=live |access-date=2021-05-05 |website=Opinión Bolivia |date= March 21, 2021|language=es |archive-date=May 5, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210505144455/https://www.opinion.com.bo/articulo/pais/mas-gana-sucre-enrique-leano-es-nuevo-alcalde/20210321235441812562.html }}</ref>

==Geography and territorial organization==
[[File:Sucre, Bolivia - (24545082440).jpg|center|thumb|280x280px|Sucre, Bolivia]]
Sucre is divided into eight numbered districts: the first five of these are urban districts, while Districts 6, 7, and 8 are rural districts. Each is administered by a Sub-Mayor ({{langx|es|Subalcalde|links=no}}), appointed by the Mayor of Sucre. The rural districts include numerous rural communities outside the urban area.
