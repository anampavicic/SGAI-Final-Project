==History==
[[File:Тот же полигон..jpg|thumb|Derelict workshop of the Dagdizel Plant about 2&nbsp;km out to sea]]

The city is one of the newer urban centers in Dagestan. It began in 1932 as a worker's encampment, servicing the needs of the nearby naval diesel engine manufacturer, [[Dagdizel Plant|Dagdizel]]. At the time, it was called ''Dvigatelstroy'' ({{lang|ru|Дви́гательстро́й}}), based upon the Russian word for "engine". During World War II, the site saw much growth due to the war effort, and became a center for major arms producers. In 1947, the settlement received the status of a city, and was given its current name, reflecting its location on the shores of the Caspian Sea.
