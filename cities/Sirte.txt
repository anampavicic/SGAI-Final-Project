'''Sirte''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɜr|t}}; {{langx|ar|سِرْت}}, {{Audio|Ar-ly-Surt.ogg|pronunciation}}), also spelled '''Sirt''', '''Surt''', '''Sert''' or  '''Syrte''', is a [[List of cities in Libya|city]] in [[Libya]]. It is located south of the [[Gulf of Sirte]], almost right in the middle between [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]] and [[Benghazi]]. It is famously known for its battles, [[Demographics of Libya|ethnic groups]] and [[Gaddafi loyalism|loyalty]] to former Libyan ruler [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. Due to developments in the [[First Libyan Civil War]], it was briefly the capital of Libya as [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]]'s successor after the [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)|Fall of Tripoli]] from 1 September to 20 October 2011. The settlement was established in the early 20th century by the [[Italian Libya|Italians]], at the site of a 19th-century fortress built by the [[Ottoman Tripolitania|Ottomans]]. It grew into a city after [[World War II]].

Contrary to popular belief, Sirte was not Muammar Gaddafi's birthplace, as wrongly reported. Gaddafi's birthplace was in a village 20&nbsp;km south of Sirte, which is called [[Qasr Abu Hadi]]. The inhabitants of this village were farmers. Just a few significant people from the [[Gaddafi tribe]], of whom some were born in Sirte, were appointed to government roles during the time of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya until the [[2011 military intervention in Libya|NATO-led invasion of Libya]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21580161-muammar-qaddafis-hometown-band-loyalists-flaunt-his-favourite-colour-where |title=Libya’s opposition: Where green refuses to fade |website=The Economist |date=29 June 2013 }}</ref> Sirte was favoured by the [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi#Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1977–2011)|Gaddafi government]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-16961376|agency=BBC News|title=Should Libya rebuild Gaddafi hometown of Sirte?|date=9 February 2012|access-date=8 September 2021}}</ref> The city was the final major stronghold of Gaddafi loyalists in the civil war and Gaddafi was [[Killing of Muammar Gaddafi|killed there]] by rebel forces on 20 October 2011 after sustaining major injury caused by French Air Force Bombs discharged as part of the [[2011 military intervention in Libya|NATO intervention]].

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Sirte is built near the site of the ancient [[Phoenicia]]n city of '''Macomedes-Euphranta''',<ref>Wallace, Jonathan; Wilkinson, Bill. ''Doing business with Libya'', p. 197. Kogan Page Publishers, 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-7494-3992-7}}</ref> which was an important link on the road along the [[Mediterranean Sea]] littoral. It is the last confirmed place where the [[Punic language]] was spoken, in the 5th century CE. The region had no recognized administrative centre and was infested for centuries by bandits. In Classical times, the coast was "proverbially dangerous to shipping",<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Syrtis|page=1897|author=P. G. W. Glare|title=Oxford Latin Dictionary|place=Oxford|publisher=The Clarendon Press|year=1982|isbn=0-19-864224-5}}</ref> called "inhospita Syrtis" in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''.<ref>Book IV, line 41</ref>
[[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' Book 2 lines 939-940 speaks of "a boggy Syrtis, neither sea/Nor good dry land".

The medieval city of Surt was located some 55&nbsp;km east of the present-day city, at a site now known as al-Mudayna or Madina Sultan.<ref name="Hamdani 1997">{{cite book |last1=Hamdani |first1=A. |editor1-last=Bosworth |editor1-first=C.E. |editor2-last=van Donzel |editor2-first=E. |editor3-last=Heinrichs |editor3-first=W.P. |editor4-last=Lecomte |editor4-first=G. |title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. IX (SAN-SZE) |date=1997 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |isbn=90-04-10422-4 |pages=894–5 |url=https://archive.org/details/EncyclopaediaDictionaryIslamMuslimWorldEtcGibbKramerScholars.13 |access-date=18 May 2022 |chapter=SŪRT}}</ref> After the Umayyad conquest of North Africa, Berbers from the Butr confederation settled in Surt, and around the middle of the 8th century they converted to [[Ibadi Islam]] along with the surrounding region.<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/> A mosque was probably built at Surt during this period, although no authors mention a mosque in Surt until the 11th century.<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/> The most detailed early description of the city was written by [[Ibn Hawqal]], who passed through Surt in 947 on his way to [[Mahdia|al-Mahdiyyah]] (which was then the capital of the [[Fatimid Caliphate]]).<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/> Ibn Hawqal described Surt as being "a bow-shot away from the sea, built on hard, sandy ground with strong walls of mud and brick".<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/> He described it as inhabited by Berbers, who stored rainwater in [[cistern]]s and were engaged in various forms of agriculture and livestock herding.<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/> They grew [[date palm|date]]s, grapes, and other fruits, and kept goats and camels.<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/> Another local industry was [[alum]] mining, which was exported.<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/> According to Ibn Hawqal, Surt at this point was wealthier than nearby [[Ajdabiya]].<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/>

Surt was probably fortified by the Fatimid caliph [[al-Mu'izz]] around 965, in preparation for the [[Fatimid conquest of Egypt]] under his general [[Jawhar al-Siqilli]].<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/> The Fatimids founded the new city of [[Cairo]] to serve as their new capital in Egypt.<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/> After they moved there, the Surt region became a battleground between the Fatimids and the [[Zirid dynasty]] of [[Kairouan]].<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/> The [[Banu Khazrun]] of [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]] also controlled Surt for a while as Fatimid allies.<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/> Around 1037, the [[Banu Hilal]] began to settle in the Surt region.<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/> Somewhat later, [[al-Bakri]] described Surt as "a large city by the sea" with a mosque, a [[hammam]], and [[bazaar]]s (these three features are mentioned for the first time here).<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/> He listed three gates in the city walls: Qiblī (facing southeast), Jawfī (facing inland), and "a small one facing the sea".<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/> There were no suburbs outside the walls.<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/> He also noted, "its animals are goats and their meat is juicy and tender, the like of which is not found in Egypt."<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/> Al-Bakri also alluded to a merchant community including Arabs, Berbers, Persians, and [[Copts]].<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/>

In the late Fatimid period, Surt began to decline - it seems to have lost its position at the intersection of east-west and north-south trade routes.<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/> The 12th-century author [[al-Idrisi]] apparently visited the Surt region and wrote about the city's decline.<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/> The 13th-century author [[Ali ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi]] wrote that its forts were still standing.<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/> At some point thereafter, the old city of Surt was finally abandoned.<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/>

Since the 19th century and particularly since the 1960s, the old city of Surt has been explored by archaeologists, mostly based on al-Bakri's reports.<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/> Excavations have revealed the old city walls, enclosing an area of 184,003 square meters, as well as the gates, the forts, the mosque, and the city streets.<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/> No evidence of the harbor has been found, though.<ref name="Hamdani 1997"/>

===Modern history===
In 1842 the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] built a fortress at ''Marsat al Zaafran'' ("[[saffron]] harbour") which became known as ''Qasr al Zaafran'' ("saffron [[Ksar|castle]]"), and later as Qasr Sert. The fortress was built under sultan [[Abdülmecid I]] as part of the restoration of Ottoman control over [[Ottoman Tripolitania|Tripolitania]] after the fall of the [[Karamanli dynasty]]. It was around this fortification, which was taken over and repaired by the [[Italo-Turkish War|Italians]] in 1912, that the settlement of Sirte grew up.<ref>Goodchild, Richard George. ''Libyan studies: select papers of the late R. G. Goodchild'', p. 136. P. Elek, 1976. {{ISBN|978-0-236-17680-9}}</ref>

Sirte served as an administrative centre under Italian rule.<ref>Ham, Anthony. ''Libya'', p. 121. Lonely Planet, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-74059-493-6}}</ref> During the [[North African Campaign]] of the [[Second World War]] there were no noteworthy events in this location, which was characterised at the time as "a shabby little Arab village of mud huts, clustered on the banks of a foul-smelling stream."<ref>Barker, A.J. ''Afrika Korps'', p. 16. Bison Books, 1978</ref>

The village grew into a prominent town after the [[Second World War]] for two reasons – the discovery and exploitation of oil nearby and the birth of [[Muammar Gaddafi]] in 1942 in a tent at [[Qasr Abu Hadi]], some {{convert|20|km|mi}} south of Sirte. He was sent to the primary school at Sirte at the age of ten.<ref>[[Geoff Simons|Simons, Geoffrey Leslie]]. ''Libya: the struggle for survival'', p. 170. Palgrave Macmillan, 1993. {{ISBN|978-0-312-08997-9}}</ref>

====Gaddafi era====
After [[1969 Libyan coup d'état|seizing power in 1969]], Gaddafi transformed Sirte into a showcase of his self-proclaimed revolution, carrying out an extensive program of public works to expand the former village into a small city. After 1988, most government departments and the Libyan parliament were relocated from Tripoli to Sirte, although Tripoli remained formally the capital of the country.<ref>"Libya". ''Europa World Year 2004'' Volume II, p. 2651. Taylor & Francis Group, 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-85743-255-8}}</ref> 
[[Al-Tahadi University]] was established in 1991.

In 1999, Gaddafi proposed the idea of creating a "[[United States of Africa]]" with Sirte as its administrative centre. Ambitious plans to build a new international airport and seaport were announced in 2007.<ref>''The Report: Libya 2008'', p. 73. Oxford Business Group, 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-902339-11-5}}</ref>

In 1999, the [[Sirte Declaration]] was signed in the city by the [[Organisation of African Unity]] in a conference that was hosted by Gaddafi. In 2007 he also hosted talks in Sirte to broker a peace agreement between the government of [[Sudan]] and warring factions in [[Darfur]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Struggle to salvage Darfur talks|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7066792.stm|access-date=29 March 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=29 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818174231/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7066792.stm|archive-date=18 August 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2008, [[China Railway Construction Corporation]] won a $2.6 billion bid in Libya to build a west-to-east coastal railway {{convert|352|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Khoms, Libya|Khoms]] to Sirte and a south-to-west railway {{convert|800|km|mi|abbr=on}} long for iron ore transport from the southern city [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]] to [[Misrata]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.crcc.cn/ |title=China Railway Construction Corporation website |access-date=14 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218093237/http://www.crcc.cn/ |archive-date=18 December 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====First Civil War====

On 5 March 2011, [[anti-Gaddafi forces]] said they were preparing to capture the city.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tomasevic|first=Goran|title=In disorganized surge, Libya's rebels push west along shifting front line|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/0305/In-disorganized-surge-Libya-s-rebels-push-west-along-shifting-front-line|access-date=6 March 2011|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=5 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307131634/http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/0305/In-disorganized-surge-Libya-s-rebels-push-west-along-shifting-front-line|archive-date=7 March 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> However, on 6 March, the rebel advance was stopped during the [[Battle of Bin Jawad]] before reaching Sirte.

Under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]], several Western and Arab countries then intervened with air and missile strikes, which turned the tide again in favour of the rebels.

In August, the city faced a more severe threat from the rebels as the loyalist position deteriorated rapidly, with rebels making gains on multiple fronts. As [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)|Tripoli came under attack]], other rebel forces based in [[Benghazi]] broke the military stalemate in the eastern desert, taking [[Fourth Battle of Brega|Brega]] and [[Ra's Lanuf]]. At the same time, rebels in [[Misrata]] pushed eastward along the coast towards Sirte, which then faced a pincer movement from the rebels on two fronts.<ref>{{cite news | title=Libyan rebels storm Gaddafi compound in Tripoli | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/appearance-by-gaddafis-son-tempers-rebel-hopes-of-victory/2011/08/23/gIQAZMWZYJ_print.html | last1=Erdbrink | first1=Thomas | last2=Sly | first2=Liz | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=2011-08-23 | access-date=2011-08-23 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311065828/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/appearance-by-gaddafis-son-tempers-rebel-hopes-of-victory/2011/08/23/gIQAZMWZYJ_print.html | archive-date=11 March 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref>  On 24 August, rebel units were reported as being {{convert|56|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/24/libya-rebels-advance-gaddafi-home-town|title=Libyan rebels advance on Gaddafi's home town|last=Stephen|first=Christopher|date=2011-08-24|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=www.guardian.co.uk|access-date=2011-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930193131/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/24/libya-rebels-advance-gaddafi-home-town|archive-date=30 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>  On 27 August, Bin Jawad &ndash; about 150&nbsp;km east &ndash; was once again recaptured by the rebels.

Anti-Gaddafi forces [[Second Gulf of Sidra offensive|surrounded the city]] during September 2011 and began a long, difficult [[Battle of Sirte (2011)|battle]] there, hoping to bring the war to an end. On 20 October, after suffering massive casualties during a siege that lasted over a month, NTC fighters mounted a major offensive and took control of the last remaining district of Sirte, "Number Two", that was in the hands of regime loyalists.

====Second Civil War====
{{Further|Libyan civil war (2014–2020)}}
The [[Libyan National Army]] [[Battle of Sirte (2020)|fought a battle]] with the GNA and entered the city on 6 January 2020.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tripoli-aligned forces say they quit Libya's Sirte to avoid bloodshed |date=6 January 2020 |access-date=7 January 2020 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security/tripoli-aligned-forces-say-they-quit-libyas-sirte-to-avoid-bloodshed-idUSKBN1Z61BP |publisher=Reuters |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200107150530/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security/tripoli-aligned-forces-say-they-quit-libyas-sirte-to-avoid-bloodshed-idUSKBN1Z61BP |archive-date=7 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>
