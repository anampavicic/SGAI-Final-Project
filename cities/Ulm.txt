'''Ulm''' ({{IPA|de|ʊlm|-|De-Ulm.ogg}}) is the sixth-largest city of the southwestern German [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Baden-Württemberg]], and with around 129,000 inhabitants, it is Germany's [[List of cities in Germany by population|60th-largest city]].

Ulm is located on the eastern edges of the [[Swabian Jura]] mountain range, on the upper course of the [[River Danube]], at the confluence with the small [[Blau (Danube)|Blau Stream]], coming from the [[Blautopf]] in the west. The mouth of the [[Iller]] also falls within Ulm's city limits. The Danube forms the border with [[Bavaria]], where Ulm's twin city [[Neu-Ulm]] lies. The city was part of Ulm until 1810, and Ulm and Neu-Ulm have a combined population of around 190,000. Ulm forms an urban district of its own (''Stadtkreis Ulm''), and is the administrative seat of the [[Alb-Donau-Kreis]], the district that surrounds it on three sides, but which the city itself is not a part of. Ulm is the overall 11th-largest [[List of cities and towns on the Danube river|city on the Danube River]], and the third-largest German Danubian city after [[Regensburg]] and [[Ingolstadt]].

Founded around 850, Ulm is rich in history and traditions as a former [[free imperial city]]. Ulm is an economic centre due to its varied industries, and is the seat of the [[University of Ulm]] (''Universität Ulm''), and of the Ulm University of Applied Sciences (''{{ill|Technische Hochschule Ulm|de}}'', THU). The city lies on the international railway corridor "[[Main Line for Europe]]", from [[Paris]] to [[Bratislava]] and [[Budapest]], via [[Strasbourg]], [[Karlsruhe]], [[Stuttgart]], Ulm, [[Augsburg]], [[Munich]], [[Salzburg]], [[Linz]] and [[Vienna]]. The [[Ulm Minster]] (''Ulmer Münster'') is the tallest church in the world ({{convert|161.53|m|abbr=on|2|disp=or}}).

In 1927, the then tiny village of Wiblingen was incorporated into Ulm, which led to that [[Wiblingen Abbey]] with its monastic library and its True Cross reliquary (''Heilig-Kreuz-Reliquie''), that allegedly contains wood particles from the [[True Cross]], is now part of Ulm.

Famous personalities born in Ulm include {{ill|Johann Georg Niederegger|de}} (1777–1859), {{ill|Karl Heinrich Kässbohrer|de}} (1864–1922), [[Albert Einstein]] (1879–1955), [[Otto Kässbohrer]] (1904–1989) and [[Hildegard Knef]] (1925–2002).

== Geography ==

[[File:Ulm Fußgängerzone.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|View from [[Ulm Minster]] towards Hirschstraße]]
Ulm lies at the point where the rivers [[Blau (Danube)|Blau]] and [[Iller]] join the [[Danube]], at an altitude of {{convert|479|m|2|abbr=on}} [[above sea level]]. Most parts of the city, including the old town, are situated on the northern bank of the Danube; only the districts of Wiblingen, Gögglingen, Donaustetten and Unterweiler lie on the southern bank. Across from the old town, on the other side of the river, lies the [[twin cities|twin city]] of [[Neu-Ulm]] in the state of [[Bavaria]], smaller than Ulm and, until 1810, a part of it (population c. 50,000).

Except for the Danube in the south, the city is surrounded by forests and hills which rise to altitudes of over {{convert|620|m|2|abbr=off}}, some of them part of the [[Swabian Alb]]. South of the Danube, plains and hills finally end in the northern edge of the [[Alps]], which are approximately {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} from Ulm and are visible from the city on clear days.

The city of Ulm is situated in the northern part of the North Alpine [[Foreland basin]], where the basin reaches the [[Swabian Alb]]. The [[Turritellenplatte]] of Ermingen ("Erminger Turritellenplatte") is a famous palaeontological site of [[Burdigalian]] age.

== Neighboring communes ==

[[File:Nuremberg chronicles f 190v191r 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Ulm in the 1493 ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'']]
On the right (south-eastern) side of Danube and Iller there is the Bavarian district town [[Neu-Ulm]]. On the left (north-western) side Ulm is almost completely surrounded by the Alb-Danube district. The neighbouring communes of Baden-Württemberg are the following: [[Illerkirchberg]], [[Staig]], [[Hüttisheim]], [[Erbach (Donau)]], [[Blaubeuren]], [[Blaustein]], [[Dornstadt]], [[Beimerstetten]] and [[Langenau]] as well as the eastern neighbouring community [[Elchingen]].

== Town subdivisions ==

The&nbsp;city&nbsp;is&nbsp;divided into 18 districts ({{langx|de|[[:de:Stadtteile|Stadtteile]]}}): Ulm-Mitte, Böfingen, Donaustetten, Donautal, Eggingen, Einsingen, Ermingen, Eselsberg, Gögglingen, Grimmelfingen, Jungingen, Lehr, Mähringen, Oststadt, Söflingen (with Harthausen), Unterweiler, Weststadt, and Wiblingen.

Nine districts were integrated during the latest municipality reform in the 1970s: Eggingen, Einsingen, Ermingen, Gögglingen-Donaustetten, Jungingen, Lehr, Mähringen und Unterweiler. They have their own local councils which acquire an important consulting position to the whole city council concerning issues that are related to the prevailing districts. But at the end, final decisions can only be made by the city council of the entire city of Ulm.

== History ==
{{See also|Free Imperial City of Ulm}}
[[File:Braun Ulm UBHD.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Ulm in 1572 by [[Georg Braun|Frans Hogenberg]]]]
The oldest traceable settlement of the Ulm area began in the early [[Neolithic]] period, around 5000 BC. Settlements of this time have been identified at the villages of Eggingen and Lehr, today districts of the city. In the city area of Ulm proper, the oldest find dates from the late Neolithic period. The earliest written mention of Ulm is dated 22 July 854 AD, when King [[Louis the German]] signed a document in the King's palace of "Hulma" in the [[Duchy of Swabia]].<ref name="500px">{{cite web|title=ulm-by-michael-vogt|url=http://500px.com/photo/9821081/ulm-by-michael-vogt|work=500px.com|access-date=24 May 2014}}</ref> The city was declared an [[Imperial Free City|Imperial City]] ({{langx|de|link=no|Reichsstadt}}) by [[Friedrich Barbarossa]] in 1181.

At&nbsp;first,&nbsp;Ulm's significance was due to the privilege of a ''[[Königspfalz]]'', a place of accommodation for the medieval German kings and emperors on their frequent travels. Later, Ulm became a city of traders and craftsmen. One of the most important legal documents of the city, an agreement between the Ulm patricians and the trade guilds ({{langx|de|link=no|Großer Schwörbrief}}), dates from 1397. This document, considered an early city constitution, and the beginning of the construction of an enormous church ([[Ulm Minster]], 1377), financed by the inhabitants of Ulm themselves rather than by the church, demonstrate the assertiveness of Ulm's medieval citizens. Ulm blossomed during the 15th and 16th centuries, mostly due to the export of high-quality textiles. The city was situated at the crossroads of important trade routes extending to Italy. These centuries, during which many important buildings were erected, also represented the zenith of art in Ulm, especially for painters and sculptors like [[Hans Multscher]] and [[Jörg Syrlin the Elder]]. During the [[Reformation]], Ulm became Protestant (1530). With the establishment of new trade routes following the discovery of the [[New World]] (16th century) and the outbreak and consequences of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648), the city began to decline gradually. During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–1714), it was alternately invaded several times by French and [[Bavaria]]n soldiers.

[[File:Charles Thévenin - Reddition de la ville d'Ulm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.45|The capitulation of Ulm. General Mack and 23,000 Austrian troops surrendered to [[Napoleon]].]]
In the wars following the [[French Revolution]], the city was alternately occupied by French and Austrian forces, with the former ones destroying the city fortifications. In 1803, it lost the status of Imperial City and was absorbed into [[Bavaria]]. During the campaign of 1805, [[Napoleon]] managed to trap the invading Austrian army of [[Karl Freiherr Mack von Leiberich|General Mack]] and forced it to surrender in the [[Battle of Ulm]]. In 1810, Ulm was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]] and lost its districts on the other bank of the Danube, which came to be known as [[Neu-Ulm]] (New Ulm).

In the mid-19th century, the city was [[Fortresses of the German Confederation|designated a fortress]] of the [[German Confederation]] with huge military construction works directed primarily against the threat of a French invasion. The city became an important centre of industrialisation in southern Germany in the second half of the 19th century, its built-up area now being extended beyond the medieval walls. The construction of the huge minster, which had been interrupted in the 16th century for economic reasons, was resumed and eventually finished (1844–1891) in a wave of German national enthusiasm for the [[Middle Ages]].

From 1933 to 1935, a [[Nazi concentration camp|concentration camp]] primarily for political opponents of the regime was established on the Kuhberg, one of the hills surrounding Ulm. The Jews of Ulm, around 500 people, were first discriminated against and later persecuted; their synagogue was torn down during {{lang|de|[[Kristallnacht]]}} in November 1938. Of 116 Jews deported from Ulm during World War II (45 were sent to [[Theresienstadt]] on 22 August 1942), only four returned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ulm|title=Ulm|website=jewishvirtuallibrary.org|access-date=14 January 2020}}</ref> Approximately 25 Jews were living in Ulm in 1968.

[[Bombing of Ulm in World War II|The sole RAF strategic bombing during World War II against Ulm]] occurred on 17 December 1944, against the two large [[Transportation Plan|lorry factories]] of [[Meillerwagen|Magirus]]-Deutz and [[Karl Kässbohrer Fahrzeugwerke|Kässbohrer]], as well as other industries, barracks, and depots in Ulm. The Gallwitz Barracks and several military hospitals were among 14 [[Wehrmacht]] establishments destroyed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/dec44.html |title=RAF History – Bomber Command 60th Anniversary |publisher=Raf.mod.uk |access-date=6 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070706011932/http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/dec44.html |archive-date=6 July 2007 }}</ref> The raid killed 707 Ulm inhabitants and left 25,000 homeless and after all the bombings, over 80% of the medieval city centre lay in ruins. The [[Magirus]] factory hosted a subcamp of the [[Dachau concentration camp]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Megargee|first=Geoffrey P.|year=2009|title=The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos 1933–1945. Volume I|publisher=Indiana University Press, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|page=554|isbn=978-0-253-35328-3}}</ref>

Some parts of the city were rebuilt in the plain and simple style of the 1950s and 1960s, but most parts of the historic old town have been restored.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.ulm.uno/index.php/ulm-city/altstadt-nord-ulm | title=Altstadt Ulm - Gassen nördlich des Münsters | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201203001008/https://www.ulm.uno/index.php/ulm-city/altstadt-nord-ulm | archive-date=2020-12-03}}</ref> Due to its almost complete destruction in 1944, the Hirschstraße part of the city primarily consists of modern architecture. Ulm experienced substantial growth in the decades following World War II, with the establishment of large new housing projects and new industrial zones. In 1967, [[Ulm University]] was founded, which proved to be of great importance for the development of the city. Particularly since the 1980s, the transition from classical industry towards the high-tech sector has accelerated, with, for example, the establishment of research centres of companies like [[Daimler AG|Daimler]], [[Siemens]] and [[Nokia]] and a number of small applied research institutes near the university campus. The city today is still growing, forming a [[twin cities|twin city]] of 170,000 inhabitants together with its neighbouring Bavarian city of [[Neu-Ulm]], and seems to benefit from its central position between the cities of [[Stuttgart]] and [[Munich]] and thus between the cultural and economic hubs of southern Germany.

The city has very old trading traditions dating from medieval times and a long history of industrialisation, beginning with the establishment of a railway station in 1850. The most important sector is still classical industry (machinery, especially motor vehicles; [[electronics]]; [[pharmaceuticals]]). The establishment of the [[University of Ulm]] in 1967, which focuses on [[biomedicine]], the sciences, and engineering, helped support a transition to high-tech industry, especially after the crisis of classical industries in the 1980s. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
