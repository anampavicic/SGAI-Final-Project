Haridwar lies in doab region where people speak [[khari boli]].<ref>{{Cite journal|date=29 January 2011|title=District Census Handbook, Hardwar|url=http://censusindia.gov.in|journal=Census of India 2011|pages=5–7}}</ref> Haridwar is regarded as a holy place for [[Hindu]]s, hosting important religious events and serving as a gateway to several prominent places of worship. Most significant of the events is the [[Kumbha Mela]], which is celebrated every 12 years in Haridwar. During the [[Haridwar Kumbh Mela]], millions of pilgrims, devotees, and tourists congregate in Haridwar to perform ritualistic bathing on the banks of the Ganges to wash away their sins to attain ''[[moksha]]''.

According to Puranic legend, Haridwar, along with [[Ujjain]], [[Nashik]], and [[Allahabad|Prayag]], is one of four sites where drops of ''[[amrita]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-02-04|title=इस पौराणिक कथा से जानिए क्यों लगता है कुंभ का मेला? – mobile|url=https://www.punjabkesari.in/dharm/news/kumbh-mela-story-related-samudra-manthan-1326800|access-date=2021-11-13|website=punjabkesari}}</ref> the elixir of immortality, accidentally spilled over from a ''[[kumbha]]'' (pitcher) while being carried by the celestial bird [[Garuda]] during the ''[[samudra manthan|Samudra Manthana]]'', or the churning of the ocean of milk.<ref name="sahaja" /> ''Brahma Kund'', the spot where the amrita fell, is believed to be located at [[Har ki Pauri]] (literally, "footsteps of the Lord") and is considered to be the most sacred ''[[ghat]]'' of Haridwar.<ref name="Madan">{{cite book|title=India through the ages|url=https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= [https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada/page/178 178]|editor=K.S.

Haridwar presents a kaleidoscope of Indian culture and development. In sacred writings, it has been differently specified as Kapilsthan, Gangadwar and Mayapuri. It is additionally a passage for the [[Chota Char Dham]] (the four principal pilgrim destinations in Uttarakhand).

==Etymology==
[[File:Haridwar Aerial view.jpg|thumb|Meandering main [[Ganga river]], known here as ''Neel Dhara'' (left) and the Ganga canal (right), passing through Haridwar.]]
The modern name of the town has two spellings: ''Haridwar and Hardwar''. Each of these names has its own connotation.

In [[Sanskrit]]'','' the liturgical language of Hinduism, ''[[Hari]]'' means "[[Vishnu]]", while ''dvāra means'' "gateway". So, ''Haridwar'' translates to "The Gateway to Vishnu". It earns this name because it is typically the place where pilgrim's start their journey to visit a prominent temple of  Vishnu – [[Badrinath Temple|Badrinath]].

Similarly, ''Hara'' could also mean "[[Shiva]]".<ref name="sahaja">[http://sahajaharidwar.tripod.com/About_Haridwar.html About Haridwar] sahajaharidwar.</ref> Hence, ''Hardwar'' could stand for "Gateway to  Shiva". Hardwar is also a typical place to start a pilgrim's journey in order to reach [[Mount Kailash]], [[Kedarnath]], the northernmost [[Jyotirlinga]] and one of the sites of the smaller ''[[Char Dham]]'' pilgrimage circuit – all important places for worship for Hindus.

According to legend, it was in Haridwar that goddess [[Ganga in Hinduism|Ganga]] descended when [[Shiva]] released the mighty river from the locks of his hair. The [[River Ganga]], after flowing for {{convert|253|km|mi}} from its source at [[Gaumukh]] at the edge of the [[Gangotri Glacier]], enters the [[Gangetic Plain]] for the first time at Haridwar, which gave the city its ancient name, Gangadwára.

During the Mughal period, there was mint for Akbar's copper coinage at Haridwar. It is said that Raja [[Man Singh]] of [[Amber, India|Amber]], laid that foundation of the present-day city of Haridwar and also renovated the ghats at Har Ki Pauri. After his death, his ashes are also said to have been immersed at Brahma Kund. [[Thomas Coryat]], an English traveller, who visited the city in the reign of Emperor [[Jahangir]] (1596–1627) mentions it as 'Haridwara', the capital of Shiva.<ref name=gaze/>

Being one of the oldest living cities, Haridwar finds its mention in the ancient Hindu scriptures as it weaves through the life and time stretching from the period of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], to the more recent British advent. Haridwar has a rich and ancient religious and cultural heritage. It still has many old [[havelis]] and mansions bearing exquisite murals and intricate stonework.

One of the two major dams on the river Ganges, the Bhimgoda, is situated here. Built-in the 1840s, it diverts the waters of the Ganges to the Upper Ganges Canal, which irrigated the surrounding lands. Though this caused severe deterioration to the Ganges water flow, and is a major cause for the decay of the Ganges as an inland waterway, which till the 18th century was used heavily by the ships of the [[Honourable East India Company|East India Company]], and a town as high up as [[Tehri]], was considered a port city The headworks of the [[Ganges Canal]] system is located in Haridwar. The Upper Ganges Canal was opened in 1854 after the work began in April 1842,<ref name=Ganges>[https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V12_144.gif Upper Ganges Canal] ''[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]]'', 1909, v. 12, p. 138.</ref> prompted by the famine of 1837–38. The unique feature of the canal is the half-kilometre-long [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] over the Solani river at [[Roorkee]], which raises the canal {{cvt|25|m}} above the original river.

'Haridwar Union Municipality' was constituted in 1868, which included the then villages of Mayapur and [[Kankhal]]. Haridwar was first connected with railways, via [[Laksar]], through branch line in 1886, when the [[Awadh]] and [[Rohilakhand]] Railway line was extended through [[Roorkee]] to [[Saharanpur]], this was later extended to [[Dehradun]] in 1900.<ref>[https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V21_381.gif Trade and Communications] ''[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]]'', v. 21, p. 375.</ref>

[[File:Third Shahi Snan in Hari Ki Pauri.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Haridwar Kumbh Mela]] is held in every 12 years and the date is determined by [[Hindu astrology]].]]
This Ghat was constructed by King [[Vikramaditya]] (1st century BCE) in memory of his brother [[Bharthari (king)|Bharthari]]. It is believed that Bharthari came to Haridwar and meditated on the banks of the holy Ganges. When he died, his brother constructed a Ghat in his name, which later came to be known as Har Ki Pauri. The most sacred ghat within Har Ki Pauri is Brahmakund. The evening prayer ([[Aarti]]) at dusk offered to [[Goddess Ganga]] at Har Ki Pauri (steps of God Hara or Shiva) is an enchanting experience for any visitor. A spectacle of sound and colour is seen when, after the ceremony, pilgrims float ''Diyas'' (floral floats with lamps) and incense on the river, commemorating their deceased ancestors. Thousands of people from all around the world do make a point to attend this prayer on their visit to Haridwar. A majority of present ghats were largely developed in the 1800s.
On the night of Dussehra or a few days before that, the Ganga Canal is dried in Haridwar to clean the riverbed. The water is restored on Diwali. It is believed that on Dussera Maa Ganga goes to her father's house and returns after Bhai Duj or Bhai Phota. It is for this reason that the waters in the Ganga canal in Haridwar are partially dried on the night of Dussehra and the waters are restored on the day of Bhai Duj or Bhai Phota.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://personal.carthage.edu/jlochtefeld/indiajterm/hd.html|title=Haridwar|website=personal.carthage.edu|access-date=1 March 2007|archive-date=27 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127111545/http://personal.carthage.edu/jlochtefeld/indiajterm/hd.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2013/20131016/dplus.htm|title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India – Dehradun Plus|website=The Tribune|location=Chandigarh}}</ref>

'''Jwalapur'''
An old part of the city, Jwalapur is the financial and industrial capital of the city, and now an important trading and shopping centre for the locals. The town dates back to 1700 CE. This town was called Mohammed Pura and ruled by a local Muslim ruler. In the early 1600s the family of Sisodias from Mewar, descendants of Rana Pratap, fleeing from the Mughal invasion, came to settle on the outskirts of Haridwar. The families lived quietly for almost a generation to avoid detection. Local people renamed their surname to Mehta. It is firmly believed that in early 1700 the Mehtas dislodged the Muslim ruler and renamed the town as Jwalapur. This family subsequently settled in Jwalapur itself and intermarried with the local population.

'''Cheela Dam'''

'''[[Shivalik Nagar, Haridwar|Shivalik Nagar]]'''
One of the newest and biggest residential areas of Haridwar. It is divided into various clusters. It was originally developed as a residential colony for BHEL employees, but with the advent of SIDCUL, population and financial activity has grown rapidly in the area due to its proximity.
