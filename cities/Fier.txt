'''Fier''' ({{IPA|sq|fiˈɛɾ|pron}}; {{lang-sq-definite|Fieri}}) is the [[List of cities and towns in Albania|seventh most populous city]] of the [[Republic of Albania]] and seat of [[Fier County]] and Fier Municipality. It is situated on the bank of Gjanica River in the [[Myzeqe|Myzeqe Plain]] between the [[Seman (river)|Seman]] in the north, the [[Vjosë]] in the south and the foothills of the Mallakastra Mountains in the southeast. Fier experiences a seasonal [[Mediterranean climate]] affected by its proximity to the [[Adriatic Sea]] in the west.

Fier was founded in the 19th century by the [[Vrioni family]] and officially in 1864 by [[Omer Pasha Vrioni II]] who was the father of [[Kahreman Pasha Vrioni]] (1889-1955).<ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgf6GWJxuZgC&q=Kahreman+Pasha+Vrioni&pg=PA478| author=Robert Elsie|page=478| title=A Biographical Dictionary of Albanian History|publisher= I.

Fier is an important terminus in southwestern Albania and is served by the [[A2 (Albania)|A2 motorway]] and [[SH 4 (Albania)|SH 4 highway]], forming a north–south corridor in Albania and part of the [[Adriatic–Ionian motorway]].

== Name ==

The word "Fier" is claimed to derive from the Albanian word ''[[wikt:fier|fier]]'', which is claimed to mean "fern". Naming locations after the local flora is a common phenomenon amongst the [[Myzeqe|Myzeqar]] Albanians.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Elezi |first=Mehmet |title=Fjalor i gjuhës shqipe |publisher=Gjergj Fishta |year=1954 |isbn=9789994387465 |pages=351 |language=Sq}}</ref> Another alternative hypothesis proposes a derivation from the Italian word ''[[wikt:fiera|fiera]]'', translated as ''trade fair''.<ref name="Fier Municipality History" />

== History ==

The history of Fier is bound up with that of the oil, gas and bitumen deposits nearby. The presence of asphalt and burning escapes of natural gas in the vicinity was recorded as early as the 1st century AD. [[Dioscorides]], in [[Materia Medica]], describes lumps of bitumen in the adjacent river Seman, and the concentrated pitch on the banks of the [[Vjosë]] river [[Strabo]], writing in about AD 17 states:

<blockquote>On the territory of the people of Apolonia in Illyria there is what is called a nymphaeum. It is a rock which emits fire. Below it are springs flowing with hot water and asphalt... the asphalt is dug out of a neighbouring hill: the parts excavated are replaced by fresh earth, which in time is converted to asphalt.</blockquote>

In the 14th and 15th centuries the location was used by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] traders as a marketplace to purchase agricultural products from the [[Myzeqe]] lowlands.<ref name="Fier Municipality History">{{cite web|url=http://bashkiafier.gov.al/?page_id=2518|title=History of the city|last=Fier Municipality|publisher=Fier Municipality|language=sq|access-date=2010-08-06|archive-date=2011-08-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812061045/http://bashkiafier.gov.al/?page_id=2518|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The settlement took city status in 1864 when Kahreman Pasha Vrioni, the local governor, asked from some [[French people|French]] architects to project a future city as an artisan and trade centre.<ref name="Fier Municipality History"/> During the 1864–1865 period a market for 122 merchants was built along the [[Gjanica]] river.<ref name="Fier Municipality History"/> The first inhabitants of the city were the servants of Kahreman Pasha [[Vrioni family|Vrioni]] and members of [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] families that had lived in the area since the early 19th century.<ref name="Fier Municipality History"/>

Twelve kilometres away from Fier is situated [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]],<ref>Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992, {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}, Page 96,"... whose land is the city Epidamnus. A river flows by the city, by name the Palamnus. Then from Epidamnus to Apollonia, a Ilirian (Albanian) city, the journey on foot takes two days. Apollonia lies fifty stades from the sea and the river ..."</ref> one of the two most important ancient Greek colonial settlements in present-day Albania. It was founded in ~600&nbsp;BC on a hill near the sea, and near what was then the course of Vjosë river by Ancient Greek settlers from [[Corfu]] and [[Corinth]]. At the time before the changes in land formation and the [[Adriatic]] coastline caused by an earthquake in the 3rd century AD, the harbour af Apollonia could accommodate as many as 100 ships. The site was on the territory of Illyrian tribe of the [[Taulantii]]. The colony was said to have been named [[Gylaceia]] after its [[Corinth]]ian founder, [[Gylax]], and later changed its name to that of city of the God Apollo. According to archaeological investigations for 100 years Greek and Illyrian have lived in separate communities.

[[File:Fiume Gjanica e Piazza della Vittoria.jpg|thumb|River Gjanica and Square of Victory]]

The economic prosperity of Apolonia grew on the basis of trade in slaves, and the local rich pastoral agricultural. In the middle of the 5th century BC, a workshop for minting coins was set up here. Through trade and commercial transactions these coins spread throughout Illyria and beyond its boundaries. In the years 214&nbsp;BC onwards, the city was involved in the war between the Illyrian [[Taulantii]] and [[Cassander]], the king of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], and in 229&nbsp;BC came under Roman control. In 168&nbsp;BC, its loyalty to Rome was rewarded. For 200 years, it was of central importance in the Roman effort to colonize the east and may have been an original terminus of the [[Egnatian Way]]. It was a vital stronghold for Caesar in the civil war between [[Pompey]] and [[Julius Caesar]]. In 45 and 44&nbsp;BC, [[Octavian]], later to become the Emperor Augustus, studied for 6 months in Apollonia, which had established a high reputation as a center of Greek learning, especially [[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|the art of rhetoric]]. It was noted by [[Cicero]], in the Philippics, as 'magna urbs et gravis' a great and important city.

Under the Empire, Apollonia remained a prosperous centre, but began to decline as the Vjosë silted up and the coastline changed after the earthquake.

Since the fall of communism construction has been taking place. In particular, an Orthodox church was reconstructed in 1999 that allows people to practice their religion.<ref>{{Cite web |title=:: T669.net - Kisha e Shen Gjergjit ne Fier :: |url=http://www.t669.org/shen_gjergji.html |access-date=2023-06-04 |website=www.t669.org}}</ref>

Fier is an important industrial city and is built by the Gjanica tributary of the [[Seman River]], and is surrounded by marshland. With nearby [[Patos]] town, it is the centre of the oil, bitumen and chemical industries in Albania. Fier additionally has been the home of power-generation in Albania with the construction of the [[Fier Power Station|Fier Power Plant]] during the communist era. Although it was decommissioned in 2007, a joint Greek-Albanian venture was announced in  2023 to revitalize these thermal plants to diversify Albania’s electrical industry.<ref>{{Cite web |date=November 17, 2023 |title=DEPA Commercial 35% stake in Albanian gas-run power plant |url=https://energypress.eu/depa-commercial-enters-albanian-gas-fueled-power-plant-project-with-35-stake/#:~:text=DEPA%2520Commercial's%2520board%2520has%2520just,energy%2520stability%2520of%2520the%2520region.%E2%80%9D |access-date=28 September 2024 |website=energypress}}</ref>

Fier is a convenient place to stay to visit the major Classical sites at nearby [[Byllis]] and Apollonia. Main roads from the central square lead south to Vlora ({{convert|35|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and east to the oil and industrial town of Patos ({{convert|8|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}}).

The creation of the [[Trans Adriatic Pipeline]] raises the economy of Fier and [[Albania]] highly. The pipe line will be crossing Fier and a Pumping Station will be built in Fier. This shows an open road to investment and employment 
of the city and country. The Pipe line has started since 2015 and is expected to be completed in 2020. This will Supply [[Albania]] Natural Gas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tap-ag.com/pipeline-construction/building-the-pipeline/in-albania|title = TAP route and infrastructure}}</ref>
