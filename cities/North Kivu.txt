'''North Kivu''' (''Jimbo la Kivu Kaskazini'' in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]) is a [[Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|province]] bordering [[Lake Kivu]] in the eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].<ref name="cia.gov">
{{cite web|author=Central Intelligence Agency|title=Democratic Republic of the Congo|work=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|location=Langley, Virginia |year=2014|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/congo-democratic-republic-of-the/|access-date=May 10, 2016}}</ref> Its capital is [[Goma]]. The 2020 population was estimated to be 8,147,400.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Congo (Dem.

North Kivu borders the provinces of [[Ituri Province|Ituri]] to the north, [[Tshopo]] to the northwest, [[Maniema]] to the southwest, and [[South Kivu]] to the south. To the east, it borders [[Uganda]] and [[Rwanda]].

The province consists of three cities—[[Goma]], [[Butembo]] and [[Beni, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Beni]]—and six [[Territories of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|territories]]—[[Beni Territory|Beni]], [[Lubero Territory|Lubero]], [[Masisi Territory|Masisi]], [[Rutshuru Territory|Rutshuru]], [[Nyiragongo Territory|Nyiragongo]] and [[Walikale Territory|Walikale]]. The [[Rwenzori Mountains]], which form part of the [[Albertine Rift]], are located on the province's eastern edge, serving as a vital source of freshwater and sustaining a plethora of [[flora]] and [[fauna]].<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Travel |first1=Love |last2=Trekking |first2=Gorilla |date=2020-10-23 |title=Gorilla Trekking |url=https://gorillatrekk.com/rwenzori-mountains-national-park-uganda/ |access-date=2023-07-28 |website=Gorilla Trekking Tours Uganda |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Kaufmann |first=Georg |last2=Hinderer |first2=Matthias |last3=Romanov |first3=Douchko |date=2016 |title=Shaping the Rwenzoris: balancing uplift, erosion, and glaciation |url=https://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~geodyn/publications/pdf/Kaufmann-etal2016_IJES_105_1761-1778.pdf? |access-date=2024-02-13 |publisher=Springer |page=1762 |language=English |publication-place=Berlin/Heidelberg, Germany}}</ref> A project has been underway since 2013 to grant city status to [[Kasindi]], [[Oicha|Oïcha]] and Luholu. The province is home to the [[Virunga National Park]], a [[World Heritage Site]] containing the endangered [[mountain gorilla]]s.

The province is politically unstable and has been one of the flashpoints of military conflict in the region since 1998.

From 2018 to 2020, North Kivu was the site of an [[2018–19 Kivu Ebola epidemic|Ebola epidemic]], which was compounded by political instability in the region.

==History==

The frontiers of the [[Congo Free State]] were defined by the Neutrality Act during the 1885 [[Berlin Conference]], in which the European powers staked out their territorial claims in Africa. The Congo Free State's northeastern boundary was defined in 1885 as "a straight line coming from the northern end of [[Lake Tanganyika]] and ending at a point located on the 30th east meridian and at 1° 20' south latitude; further north, the border is formed by the 30th meridian east." On this basis, all of Lake Kivu and both banks of the [[Ruzizi River]] were in the Free State.{{sfn|Lederer|1993|p=2}}

In June 1909, [[John Methuen Coote]] started the [[Kivu frontier incident]] when he travelled southwest from the British [[Uganda Protectorate]] and established fortified camps at [[Burungu]] and [[Rubona, Rwanda|Rubona]] on Lake Kivu.{{sfn|Lederer|1993|p=2}} British troops under Coote withdrew from the Rubona post on 29 June 1909, and the Belgians occupied the post.{{sfn|Rutanga|2011|p=70}} After a series of incidents, the boundaries of the Congo, Uganda and Rwanda were settled in May 1910, with the eastern part of Kivu assigned to Uganda and the German colony of Rwanda.{{sfn|Rutanga|2011|p=89}}

[[Kivu District]] was created by an ''arrêté royal'' of 28 March 1912, which divided the Congo into 22 districts.{{sfn|Lemarchand|1964|p=63}} By 1954, Kivu District had been split into [[Sud-Kivu District]] and [[Nord-Kivu District]].

The region was the scene of much fighting during the [[Second Congo War]] (1998–2003) and the [[Kivu conflict]] (2004–present).

On August 19, 2003, DRC government decree 019/2003 offered [[Laurent Nkunda]] the rank of Brigadier General and command of the new Congo Government's [[Military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|FARDC]] Eighth Military Region, covering North Kivu. He declined. On May 26, 2004, General Obed Wibasira (RCD-Goma) was named to the position. But Wibasira was suspected of complicity with the soldiers in Goma who had triggered a mutiny in Bukavu in February 2004, and on January 23, 2005, he was switched with [[Gabriel Amisi Kumba]], at the time commander of the Fifth Military Region in [[Kasaï-Oriental]].<ref>Jean Omasombo (ed.), RDC: Biographies des Acteurs de la Troisième République, Africa Museum, Bruxelles, 24-25.</ref> Kumba was named as a Brigadier General when taking up the post. General Louis Ngizo, a former commander of the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]], was appointed a commander in November 2006. Brigadier General Vainqueur Mayala was transferred from command of the Ituri operational zone, promoted to Major General, and appointed military region commander in May 2007.{{Citation needed|date=November 2023}} Ngizo left Goma on May 13, 2007, his next posting not being known at the time. During late 2008, the FARDC maintained its dismal record in combat against Nkunda's CNDP faction, losing the [[Rumangabo]] military camp to the rebels.

The dissident [[Mai-Mai]] 85th Brigade, commanded by Colonel Samy Matumo, controlled the [[cassiterite]] mine at [[Bisie]], just north of Manoire in [[Walikale]], in southeastern North Kivu.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/world/africa/16congo.html?_r=2&ref=todayspaper&pagewanted=all&oref=slogin&oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=Congo's Riches, Looted by Renegade Troops | first=Lydia | last=Polgreen | date=November 16, 2008 | access-date=April 9, 2010}}</ref> The former [[Rally for Congolese Democracy|RCD-K/ML]] also has fighters in the province; 'at the beginning of the transition [2002-3] the RCD-Mouvement de Libération president declared he had 8-10,000 Armée Patriotic Congolaise (APC) troops in the Beni-Lubero area of North Kivu.' This exaggerated figure seems to have been reduced to 'several thousand' (2-4,000?) as of early 2006, following demobilizations and men joining the integrated brigades.<ref>International Crisis Group, Security Sector Reform in the Congo, Africa Report N°104, February 13, 2006, p.14</ref>

The [[Effacer le tableau]] and [[Beni massacre]] occurred in the province.

==Geography==
North Kivu borders [[Lake Edward]] to its east with [[Uganda]] and [[Lake Kivu]] to its southeast with [[Rwanda]]. The [[Virunga Mountains]] extends through the province. The mountain range is the site of the volcanoes [[Mount Nyiragongo]] and [[Nyamuragira]], where approximately 40% of Africa's volcanic activity takes place, and [[Virunga National Park]], which hosts [[mountain gorilla]]s, an [[endangered species]].

In October 2007, the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) warned of an increasing number of [[Internally displaced person|internally displaced people]] (IDP) in North Kivu related to the [[Kivu conflict|fighting]] there between the government [[Military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|army]], the [[Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda]] (FDLR) rebels and renegade troops, including [[Laurent Nkunda]]'s forces, and a buildup of military supplies and forces, including recruitment of [[Military use of children|child soldiers]] by armed groups across North Kivu. The UNHCR thought that there were over 370,000 people in North Kivu displaced since December 2006, and is expanding its camps in the [[Mugunga]] area, where over 80,000 IDPs were estimated.<ref>{{cite news |title=DR Congo: UN agency concerned at military buildup in North Kivu |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=24198&Cr=DRC&Cr1= |publisher=UN News Service |date= October 5, 2007 |access-date=October 6, 2007 }}</ref> The brief capture of Goma by [[M23 rebellion|M23 rebels]] caused "tens of thousands" of refugees.
