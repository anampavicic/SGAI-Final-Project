'''Barysaw'''<!--See WP:BELARUSIANNAMES--> or '''Borisov''' ({{langx|be|Барысаў}}, {{IPA-be|baˈrɨsaw|IPA}}; {{langx|ru|Борисов}}, {{IPA|ru|bɐˈrʲisəf|IPA}}) is a city in [[Minsk Region]], [[Belarus]]. It serves as the administrative center of [[Barysaw District]].<ref name="pop"/> It is located on the [[Berezina|Berezina River]] and {{convert|74|km}} north-east from the capital [[Minsk]]. As of 2024, it has a population of 135,696.<ref name="pop"/>

==History==
===Early history===
Barysaw is first mentioned in the [[Laurentian Codex]] as being founded (as Borisov) in 1102 by the [[Prince of Polotsk]] [[Rogvolod Vseslavich]], who had the baptismal name of [[Boris (given name)|Boris]]. During the next two centuries, it was burned and then rebuilt south of where it was before.

===Under Lithuania===
From the late 13th century to 1795, the town was part of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], which was part of the Polish-Lithuanian union since the [[Union of Krewo]] (1385) and the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] after the [[Union of Lublin]] (1569).

In 1500, during the [[Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars#Second war (1500–1503)|Lithuanian–Muscovite War]], [[Alexander Jagiellon]] resided in Barysaw Castle. In 1563, it was granted [[Magdeburg rights|Magdeburg town rights]] by King [[Sigismund II Augustus]].[[File:Barysaŭ. Барысаў (1792).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Coat of arms in 1792]]

In the last years of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], troops were stationed here, including the [[2nd Lithuanian Vanguard Regiment|2nd]] and [[4th Lithuanian Vanguard Regiment|4th]] Lithuanian Vanguard Regiments and 1st Lithuanian Infantry Regiment.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gembarzewski|first=Bronisław|title=Rodowody pułków polskich i oddziałów równorzędnych od r. 1717 do r. 1831|year=1925|language=pl|publisher=Towarzystwo Wiedzy Wojskowej|location=Warszawa|pages=14, 33}}</ref> King [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] established the town's coat of arms (decree #17435), the top half containing the coat of arms of [[Minsk]], while the lower half had two stylized towers on a silver background with a passage between them and [[Saint Peter]] above the towers holding a key in his hand.

Barysaw became part of the [[Russian Empire]] in 1793 as a result of the [[Second Partition of Poland]].

===19th century===
After the [[Partitions of Poland]], Barysaw was an [[uyezd]] town in the [[Minsk Governorate]].

In 1812, Barysaw became a crucial location when [[Napoleon]]'s troops [[Battle of Berezina|crossed the Berezina river]]. The French feinted a crossing at the town itself, but successfully escaped the pursuing armies by building two wooden bridges north of the city, at Studianka. This event is reenacted by military locals during town festivals. A cannon from the [[Napoleonic era]] is kept by the town's museum.
[[File:Barysaŭ, Novaje Miesta, Čyhunačnaja. Барысаў, Новае Места, Чыгуначная (1871).jpg|thumb|left|Railway station in the 19th century]]
In 1871, the railway between [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]] and [[Moscow]] passed near Barysaw, and a station was built there. In 1900 the area around the station was annexed the town.
[[File:Barysaŭ, Mienskaja. Барысаў, Менская (1916) (2).jpg|thumb|Barysaw in the early 20th century]]

===20th century===
During [[World War I]], after the fall of Tsarist [[Russia]], fights broke out for control of the city and it changed owners several times. In November 1917 the area became a part of [[Soviet Russia]], from early 1918 it was occupied by [[German Empire|Germany]], in December 1918 it fell to the Soviets again, from 1919 to 1920 it was controlled by [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], before being captured by the Soviets for the third time.

Soviet rule was recognized by the [[Peace of Riga]] in 1921 and the city was included in the [[Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic]].[[File:Barysaŭ, Rynak. Барысаў, Рынак (1941-44) (2).jpg|thumb|Barysaw ca. 1941-1944]]

During [[World War II]], Barysaw was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] from 2 July 1941 to 1 July 1944,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/44814657?searchTerm=Borisov|title=Exultant Salvos: Moscow Hails Borisov|newspaper=[[The West Australian]]|date=2 July 1944|page=5|accessdate=23 February 2021|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> and most of the city was destroyed. The Germans also operated the Dulag 126, Dulag 184, Dulag 240 and Stalag VI-H [[German prisoner-of-war camps in World War II|prisoner-of-war camps]] in the city.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Megargee|first1=Geoffrey P.|last2=Overmans|first2=Rüdiger|last3=Vogt|first3=Wolfgang|year=2022|title=The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos 1933–1945. Volume IV|publisher=Indiana University Press, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|pages=79, 102, 115, 437|isbn=978-0-253-06089-1}}</ref>

Since May 1948 the city has been home to the headquarters of the [[7th Tank Army]], which became the 65th Army Corps and then the [[North Western Operational Command]] of the [[Armed Forces of Belarus]] in 2001. In 2000s the Head of City Administration, or Mayor, was Vassily Burgun.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spring96.org/ru/news/42530|script-title=ru:В Борисове составлен свой список невъездных чиновников | publisher=Правозащитный центр «Весна»|language=ru|trans-title=Its own list of members of authorities who are not eligible to leave the country was created in Barysaw}}</ref>
