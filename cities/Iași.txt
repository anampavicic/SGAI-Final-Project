Scholars have different theories on the origin of the name "Iași".<ref>[http://www.ziaruldeiasi.ro/local/inceputurile-iasului-o-incursiune-in-istoria-timpurie-a-orasului~ni4i2v The beginnings of Iași] {{in lang|ro}}</ref> Some argue that the name originates with the [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] tribe [[Iazyges]] (of Iranian origin), one mentioned by [[Ovid]] as {{lang|la|"ipse vides, onerata ferox ut ducat '''Iazyx'''/ per medias Histri plaustra bubulcus aquas"}}<ref>''Epistulae ex Ponto'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0493%3Abook%3D4%3Apoem%3D7 4.9], lines 9-10</ref> and {{lang|la|"'''Iazyges''' et Colchi Metereaque turba Getaque/ Danubii mediis vix prohibentur aquis"}}.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Ovid]]|title=Ovid: Tristia Book III|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qmZEAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA60|page=60|edition=2nd, rev.|location=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1893|editor=Sidney George Owen|orig-year=c. 8 a.d.}}</ref>

Other explanations show that the name originated from the Iranian [[Alans|Alanic]] tribe of '''Jassi''', having the same origin with the Yazyges tribes [[Jassic people]]. In medieval times the Prut river was known as ''Alanus fluvius'' and the city as ''Forum Philistinorum''.<ref>Alexandru I. Gonța, Românii și hoarda de aur, Editura Demiurg, Iași, 2010, p. 102</ref><ref>C.C. Giurescu, Târguri sau orașe și cetăti moldovene, București, 1967, p.242-245</ref><ref>Gh. Ghibănescu, Originile Iașilor, în "Arhiva", Iași,1904, p.42-46</ref> From this population derived the plural of the town name, "Iașii".

Another historian wrote that the '''Iasians''' lived among the [[Cumans]] and that they left the Caucasus after the first Mongolian campaign in the West, settling temporarily near the Prut. He asserts that the ethnic name of Jasz which is given to the Iasians by the Hungarians has been erroneously identified with the Jazyges; also he shows that the word ''jasz'' is a Slavic loan word.<ref>A.P. Horvath, Pechenegs, Cumans, Iașians, Hereditas, Budapest, 1989, p. 64</ref>  The Hungarian name of the city (''Jászvásár'') literally means "Jassic Market"; the antiquated Romanian name, ''Târgul Ieșilor'' (and the once-favoured ''Iașii''), and the German ''Jassenmarkt'', may indicate the same meaning.

===Ancient times===
Archaeological investigations attest to the presence of human communities on the present territory of the city and around it as far back as the prehistoric age.<ref name="Mono"/> Later settlements included those of the [[Cucuteni–Trypillia culture]], a late [[Neolithic]] [[archaeological culture]].

There is archaeological evidence of human settlements in the area of Iași dating from the 6th to 7th centuries (Curtea Domnească) and 7th to 10th centuries; these settlements contained rectangular houses with semicircular ovens.<ref>C. Cihodaru, Gh. Platon, Istoria orașului Iași, Editura Junimea, 1980, pp 30–50</ref> Also, many of the vessels (9th–11th centuries) found in Iași had a cross, potentially indicating that the inhabitants were Christians.<ref>Dan Gh. Teodor, Creștinismul la est de Carpați, Editura Mitopoliei Moldovei și Bucovinei, Iași, 1984, p.91,93,136</ref>

===Early development===
In 1396, Iași is mentioned by the German crusader [[Johann Schiltberger]] (a participant in the [[Battle of Nicopolis]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Groza |first=Vasilica-Monica |date=2013 |title=Anthropological research on the urban population inhabiting the city of Iaşi during the medieval period.

This is a grant of certain commercial privileges by the Moldavian [[List of Moldavian rulers|Prince]] [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander]] to the Polish merchants of [[Lviv|Lvov]]. However, as buildings older than 1408 still exist, e.g. the Armenian Church believed to be originally built in 1395, it is certain that the city existed before its first surviving written mention.

===Capital of Moldavia===
Around 1564, Prince [[Alexandru Lăpuşneanu|Alexandru Lăpușneanu]] moved the Moldavian capital from [[Suceava]] to Iași. Between 1561 and 1563, a school and a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church were founded by the [[Greeks|Greek]] adventurer prince, [[Ioan Iacob Heraclid]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
[[File:Iglesia_Trei_Ierarhi_(acabada).jpg|thumb|[[Trei Ierarhi Monastery]] (1639)]]
[[File:Iassy-1701.jpg|thumb|Iași in the 1700s]]
In 1640, [[Vasile Lupu]] established the first school in which the Romanian replaced Greek, and set up a printing press in the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] [[Trei Ierarhi Monastery]] (''Monastery of the [[Three Holy Hierarchs|Three Hierarchs]]''; built 1635–39). Between 15 September – 27 October 1642, the city hosted the [[Synod of Iași]] (also referred to as the Synod of Jassy).<ref name="McGuckin2010">{{cite book|author=John Anthony McGuckin|title=The Encyclopedia of Eastern Orthodox Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JmFetR5Wqd8C&pg=PA325|date=15 December 2010|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-9254-8|pages=325–}}</ref> In 1643, the first volume ever printed in [[Moldavia]] was published in Iași.

The city was often burned down and looted by the [[Nogais|Tatars]] (in 1513, 1574, 1577, 1593), by the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]] in 1538, the [[Cossacks]] and Tartars (1650), or the [[Polish people|Poles]] (1620, 1686).<ref name="foc">{{cite news |last=Hopulele |first=Cătălin |date=12 January 2021 |title=De câte ori a fost trecut Iașul prin foc și sabie |trans-title=Every time Iași was passed by fire and sword |url=https://www.ziaruldeiasi.ro/stiri/de-cate-ori-a-fost-trecut-iasul-prin-foc-si-sabie-o-istorie-cruda-a-orasului-in-care-traim--275611.html |language=Romanian |location=ziaruldeiasi.ro |access-date=12 January 2021}}</ref> In 1734, it was hit by the [[Bubonic plague|plague]]. The city was also affected by famine (1575, 1724, 1739–1740), or large local fires (1725, 1735, 1753, 1766, 1785), propagated by many buildings that were built on wooden structures.<ref name="foc"/>

It was through the [[Treaty of Jassy]] that the sixth [[Russo-Turkish War, 1787-1792|Russo-Turkish War]] was brought to a close in 1792. A Greek revolutionary manoeuvre and occupation under [[Alexander Ypsilantis (1792–1828)|Alexander Ypsilanti]] (Αλέξανδρος Υψηλάντης) and the [[Filiki Eteria]] (Φιλική Εταιρία) (1821, at the beginning of the [[Greek War of Independence]]) led to the storming of the city by the Turks in 1822.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} In 1844 a severe fire affected much of the city.

===Mid–19th century to 20th century===
[[File:Statuia lui Alexandru Ioan Cuza din Iaşi3.jpg|thumb|right|Union Square]]
Between 1564 and 1859, the city was the capital of Moldavia; then, between 1859 and 1862, both Iași and [[Bucharest]] were de facto capitals of the [[United Principalities]] of Moldavia and Wallachia. In 1862, when the union of the two principalities was recognised under the name of ''Romania'', the national capital was established in Bucharest. For the loss caused to the city in 1861 by the removal of the seat of government to Bucharest the [[Constituent Assembly|constituent assembly]] voted 148,150 [[Romanian leu|lei]] to be paid in ten annual instalments, but no payment was ever made.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

During [[World War I]], Iași was the capital of a much reduced Romania for two years, following the [[Central Powers]]' occupation of Bucharest on 6 December 1916. The capital was returned to Bucharest after the defeat of [[Imperial Germany]] and its allies in November 1918. In November–December 1918 Iași hosted the [[Jassy Conference]].

===Jewish community===
{{See also|History of the Jews in Romania}}
Iași also figures prominently in [[Jew]]ish history, with the first documented presence of [[Sephardi Jews]] from the late 16th century. The oldest tomb inscription in the local cemetery probably dates to 1610.<ref name="yivo">{{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Iasi|title=YIVO – Iaşi|website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org}}</ref> By the mid-19th century, owing to widespread [[History of the Jews in the Soviet Union|Russian Jewish]] and [[History of the Jews in Poland|Galician Jewish]] [[immigration]] into Moldavia, the city was at least one-third Jewish, growing to 50% Jewish by 1899 according to the ''Great Geographic Dictionary of Romania'' cited by [[JewishGen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/iasi/ias040.html|title = Iasi (Romania) Pages 40–64}}</ref> The [[Pod Roșu Synagogue|Podu Roș Synagogue]] was built in Iași, circa 1810, by [[Avraham Yehoshua Heshel]] of [[Apta (Hasidic dynasty)|Apta]], but the synagogue became mostly [[Misnagdim|Misnagdic]] not long thereafter.

In 1855, Iași was the home of the first-ever [[Yiddish]]-language newspaper, ''Korot Haitim'', and, in 1876, the site of what was arguably the first-ever professional [[Yiddish theatre]] performance, established by [[Abraham Goldfaden|Avraham Goldfaden]]. The words of [[HaTikvah]], the national anthem of Israel, were written in Iași by [[Naftali Herz Imber]]. Jewish musicians in Iași played an important role as preservers of Yiddish folklore, as performers and composers.

The first Zionist [[Hebrew language|Hebrew-language]] newspaper in Romania, ''Emek Israel'', was published in Iași in 1882. Zionist sports clubs, student associations and discussion groups were established in the city, most of which later merged into the [[World Zionist Organization|Organizația Sionistă]]. The Hachshara Farms in Iași were a type of training farms to prepare young people for resettlement in the Palestine region.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Eaton |first1=Henry |title=The Origins and Onset of the Romanian Holocaust |date=2013 |page=35 |publisher=Wayne State University Press |isbn=9780814338568 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zA6JdrbCkJwC}}</ref>

According to the 1930 census, with a population of 34,662 (some 34% of the city's population), Jews were the second largest ethnic group in Iași. There were over 127 [[synagogue]]s. 
After [[World War II]], in 1947, there were about 38,000 Jews living in Iași. Because of massive emigration to Israel, in 1975 there were about 3,000 Jews living in Iași and four synagogues were active.<ref name="yivo"/>

Currently, Iași has a dwindling Jewish population of ca. 300 to 600 members and two working synagogues, one of which, the 1671 [[Great Synagogue (Iaşi)|Great Synagogue]], is the [[Oldest synagogues in the world|oldest surviving synagogue]] in Romania and among the oldest synagogues still active in Europe. A 10-year restoration project funded by UNESCO, the Romanian Ministry of Culture and the local authorities of Iași restored it to its former glory, opening in time for [[Hanukkah]] on 4 December 2018.<ref>[https://www.wmf.org/project/great-synagogue-ia%C5%9Fi Great Synagogue of Iași] at wmf.org</ref><ref>https://www.romania-insider.com/iasi-synagogue-reopens at romania-insider.com</ref>

===World War II===
{{Main|Iași pogrom}}
During the war, while the full scale of [[the Holocaust]] remained generally unknown to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]], the [[Iaşi pogrom|Iași pogrom]] stood as one of the known examples of [[Axis Powers|Axis]] brutality toward the Jews. The pogrom lasted from 29 June to 6 July 1941, and over 13,266 people,<ref name="Iasipogrom">[http://www.jewishgen.org/databases/holocaust/0099_Iasi.html Jewishgen]<br />[http://www.rri.ro/art.shtml?lang=1&sec=9&art=149652 The Iași Pogrom] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518231651/http://www.rri.ro/art.shtml?lang=1&sec=9&art=149652 |date=2012-05-18 }} at Radio Romania International<br />[http://www.zionism-israel.com/dic/iasi_pogrom.htm Iași Pogrom] quotes 13,266 or 14,850 Jews killed.</ref> or one third of the Jewish population, were massacred in the pogrom itself or in its aftermath, and many were deported. Particularly brutal was the massacre of Jews who were forced on sealed trains in the brutal summer heat.  Over half of the occupants perished in these trains, which were aimlessly driven throughout the countryside with no particular destination.

In May 1944, the Iași area became the scene of ferocious fighting between Romanian-[[Germany|German]] forces and the advancing [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] and the city was partially destroyed. The German [[Grossdeutschland Division|Panzergrenadier Division ''Großdeutschland'']] won a defensive victory at the [[First Battle of Târgu Frumos|Battle of Târgu Frumos]], near Iași, which was the object of several [[NATO]] studies during the [[Cold War]]. By 20 August, Iași had been taken by Soviet forces.<ref>[http://www.ziarullumina.ro/articole;1985;1;2005;0;20-august-1944-ultima-zi-de-razboi-la-Iasi.html The last day of the war in Iași]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{in lang|ro}}</ref>

Iași suffered heavy damage due to Soviet (June–July 1941, June 1944) and American (June 1944) airstrikes, respectively. The bombing of Soviet aviation and artillery on 20 August 1944, resulted in more than 5,000 civilian deaths and the destruction of two-thirds of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ieseanul.com/al-doilea-razboi-mondial-bombardamentele-care-au-mutilat-iasul/ | title=Al doilea război mondial: bombardamentele care au mutilat Iașul |language= Romanian |trans-title=World War II: the bombings that mutilated Iasi | publisher=ieseanul.com |date=25 February 2020}}</ref>

After [[Romanian Revolution|the end of the Communist regime]] and the transition to a free market economy, the private sector has grown steadily, while much of the old industry gradually decayed.

==Geography==

===Topography===
{{See also|Seven hills of Iași}}
[[File:RO IS Iaşi , panoramic view 4.JPG|thumb|Panoramic view of the Copou Hill]]
Located in the North-East of Romania, at the contact between the [[Jijia Plain]] and the [[Bârlad Plateau]], Iași used to be the crossroads place of the historic trade routes that passed through Moldavia coming from the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Kingdom of Poland]], [[Habsburg monarchy]], [[Tsardom of Russia]], and [[Constantinople]].

The city lies on the [[Bahlui River]] valley, a tributary of the [[Jijia River (Prut)|Jijia River]] (tributary of the [[Prut River]]). The surrounding country is one of uplands and woods, featuring monasteries and parks. Iași itself stands amid vineyards and gardens, partly on hills, partly in the in-between valley.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The central part of the city is located on the {{convert|25|m|abbr=on|lk=out}} fluvial terrace of the Bahlui River (the so-called Palat Terrace).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Martiniuc|first=C|date=1959|title=Harta geomorfologică a orașului Iași|journal=Analele Științifice ale Universității "Al. I. Cuza" din Iași (serie nouă), secțiunea II (Științe naturale)|volume=5|pages=183–190}}</ref> From this nucleus, the city evolved after the medieval times toward south and north on the Bahlui River floodplain and on the adjacent hills. The southern part of the city lies on the [[Iași Ridge]] ({{langx|ro|Coasta Iașilor}}) (the northernmost hill of the Bârlad Plateau). Considering the present day extension of the administrative boundaries, the city territory has an altitudinal extension of {{convert|320|m|abbr=on}}, between the 34.5 [[Metres above sea level|m a.s.l.]] (113.19&nbsp;ft) in the Bahlui River floodplain, at the Holboca bridge, and 354.77 m a.s.l. (1,163.94&nbsp;ft), at the edge of the [[Repedea Hill Fossil Site|Repedea Hill]].

It is a common belief that Iași is built on seven hills ({{langx|ro|coline}}): Breazu, Bucium, Cetățuia, Copou, Galata, Repedea and Șorogari, thus triggering comparisons with [[Rome]].

===Climate===
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Iaşi falls within either a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa'', near ''Dfb'') if the {{convert|0|°C}} isotherm is used, or a [[humid temperate climate]] (''Cfa'') bordering on an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'') if the {{convert|-3|°C}} isotherm is used. Iași experiences four distinct seasons. Summers are warm with temperatures sometimes exceeding {{convert|35|°C|0|abbr=on}} while winters are cold and windy with moderate snowfall and temperatures at night sometimes dropping below {{convert|-15|°C|0|abbr=on}}.

====Pilgrimage====
The city has become a major Christian pilgrimage site since the [[early modern period]]. In 1641, the relics of [[Parascheva of the Balkans|Saint Parascheva]] were brought to Iași.

Begun in 1833, at the time when Iași was the capital of [[Moldavia]], by Prince [[Mihail Sturdza]] and under the plans of Gheorghe Asachi and Mihail Singurov, [[Copou Park]] was integrated into the city and marks one of the first Romanian coordinated public parks. The oldest monument in Romania stands in the middle of the park, the {{ill|Obelisk of Lions|ro|Obeliscul cu lei din Iași}} (1834), a {{convert|13.5|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} tall [[obelisk]], dedicated to the ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'', the first law on political, administrative and juridical organisation in Romanian Principalities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turism-iasi.ro/index.php?id=157&sid=22|title=::Turism in orasul Iasi : It all started at Iasi|website=www.turism-iasi.ro}}</ref>

Founded in 1856, the [[Botanical Garden of Iaşi|Botanical Garden of Iași]], the first botanical garden in Romania, has an area of over 100 hectares, and more than 10,000 species of plants.

[[Iași Exhibition Park]] was opened in 1923 and built under the co-ordination of the architect [[Ghica family|N. Ghica Budești]].

The [[Ciric Park]], located in the north-eastern part of Iași, consists of parkland and four lakes.

[[Eminescu's Linden Tree]] ({{langx|ro|Teiul lui Eminescu}}) is a 500-year-old silver linden (''[[Tilia tomentosa]] [[Conrad Moench|Moench]]'') situated in [[Copou Park]]. [[Mihai Eminescu]] reportedly wrote some of his best works underneath this linden tree, rendering it one of Romania's most important [[natural monument]]s and a notable Iași landmark.<ref>Pettersen, L. & Baker, M. . Romania. Lonely Planet Travel Guide. p. 262.</ref> The {{ill|Odd Poplars Alley|ro|Plopii fără soț}}, in Bucium neighbourhood, is another spot where Mihai Eminescu sought inspiration (the poem "Down Where the Lonely Poplars Grow"). In 1973, the 15 white poplars still left (with the age ranges between 233 and 371 years) were declared natural monuments.

Iași County has 387 centuries-old trees, of which 224 were declared monument trees and 160 got the [[Romanian Academy]]'s approval and are proposed for such a classification. Most of them are oak or linden trees. The oldest tree in the county is the 675-year-old hybrid linden (''[[Tilia]]'') tree located in the courtyard of [[Bârnova Monastery]], in the vicinity of Iași. When the linden was about 57 years old and about {{convert|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, Iași was mentioned as an urban settlement, during the reign of Prince [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander the Good]] (1408).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agerpres.ro/engleza-destinatie-romania/2014/09/04/destination-romania-iasi-the-county-of-centuries-old-trees-13-57-22|title=DESTINATION/ROMANIA: Iasi – the county of centuries-old trees|last=AGERPRES|website=www.agerpres.ro|access-date=2015-08-14|archive-date=2019-08-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190806074723/https://www.agerpres.ro/engleza-destinatie-romania/2014/09/04/destination-romania-iasi-the-county-of-centuries-old-trees-13-57-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The first institute of higher learning that functioned on the territory of Romania was [[Vasilian College|Academia Vasiliană]] (1640) founded by Prince [[Vasile Lupu]] as a "higher school for Latin and Slavonic languages", followed by the [[Princely Academy, Iaşi|Princely Academy]] in 1707.

The first high education structure in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] was established in the autumn of 1813, when engineer [[Gheorghe Asachi]] laid the foundations of a class of engineers, its activities taking place within the [[Greek language|Greek]] Princely Academy.

After 1813, other moments marked the development of higher education in Romanian, regarding both [[humanities]] and the technical science. In 1835, [[Academia Mihăileană]] founded by [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]] [[Mihail Sturdza]] is considered first Romanian superior institute in the country.

It is now known as the [[Grigore T. Popa University of Medicine and Pharmacy]].

In 1937, the two [[applied science]] sections of the University of Iași became departments of the newly created [[Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iaşi|Gheorghe Asachi Polytechnic School]]. In the period before and after [[World War II]], the later (renamed ''Polytechnic Institute'' in 1948) extended its domain of activity, especially in the field of engineering, and became known as Gheorghe Asachi Technical University in 1993.
